big Brother, he has many eyeballs, my friend.
you see a place that even looks like it can afford security, you just ease on down the road.
this... This is your laptop, right?
Yeah. That's mine.
what --gee --hey --what are you --what was that?!
thank you, I guess. - No problem.
you owe me five grand, cash.
what? - What?
unless you wanna go comparison shop at the mall, sweet cheeks.
say hi to the cops for me.
okay.
let's blue steel you up some new I. D.
Mr. and Mr. Smith.
do it again! Come on, do it again!
so you're just gonna touch me in the morning, then just walk away?
are you still talkin'?
aren't you sick of this yet?
you bleed.
black... snot, sure, but you bleed, you can die.
sure, sport, whatever you say.
try the acid again, why don't you?
poor sap. You're stumped.
give it a rest, mouthy.
how long you think these'll hold once the spell wears off, hmm?
tick tock, old man.
I'm gonna really enjoy eating you, right down to that hat.
I said shut up.
and then I'm gonna eat everyone... you ever said hello to.
hot damn.
well, that's somethin'.
I marked all the towns your stunt doubles hit so you can see the pattern.
all right, great. Um, so, what is the pattern?
no clue, man. I can't see it.
seems random. - Little tip from a pro...
there is no such thing as a random series of robbery murders by your evil twins.
well, have yourself some uppers and look at that some more.
good luck.
Thanks, Frank. - For what?
sending you to your death?
your doubles want to be on "candid camera," put you in the line of fire.
now, I'd lay low,'cause I love life and its infinite mysteries.
but you two want to be dumb, that's fine.
at least have the common sense to ditch your car.
uh, excuse me. What?
your doublemints --they're using a car just like the one outside.
what the... What the hell are you doing here?
you're all charm, Bobby.
so my therapist keeps telling me.
how'd you find me? - I'm a cop, remember?
you gonna invite me in?
well, you may not want me to. I got one of the big mouths downstairs.
so I won't go downstairs.
I, uh...
I wanted to come thank you. - Thank me?
well, yeah... Seeing as they were fresh out of "thanks for saving me from liver-eating surgeon" cards at the store.
Oh, that. Just doing my job, which nobody pays me for.
right. How you doing, Bobby?
I'm fine. Every day is a gift.
your house just burned down.
as you can see, I got a roof over me.
Bobby! Let someone be nice to you for five minutes?
okay. But not too nice. I can't be going soft.
course not.
I can cook. Ish. You know?
why don't you let me make you something?
maybe put this new place of yours in some kind of order.
come on. I owe you that much.
okay. Thanks, sheriff.
Jody.
did you think it would be that easy? - No.
but it's a start.
you okay?
you know, it's bad enough that they're ganking people, wearing our mugs, but now this?
have us driving around in this... caboodle while Baby's on lockdown.
it's temporary, Dean.
nobody puts Baby in a corner.
y-you know that's a line from --Swayze movie.
Swayze always gets a pass!
right. Uh, well, you want some tunes or something?
here.
sorry, man, I-I... - Just leave it.
probably gonna be the only thing on.
Dean. - What?
Jericho --the lady in white.
blackwater --wendigo.
lake Manitoc --the kid in the lake.
they're hitting towns we've worked jobs in.
in order. Since the day I left Stanford with you.
so, what, they want us to find them?
well, one way to find out --next case would be in...
St. Louis.
perfect. Connor's Diner.
best burgers in St. Louis. Oh, I deserve something good in my life right now.
you know, he has one of these every day.
and in his heart, he thinks they're almost as good as sex.
this... is disgusting.
dead plants with creamy goo. It's like eating self-righteousness.
I mean, you tell me which is worse.
I mean, honestly, I just... You know what? I can't stand the guy.
talk about a hero complex.
and he doesn't have relationships. No, he has applications for sainthood.
Oh, and he thinks he's funny. He thinks he's a damn comedian.
who has two thumbs and full-blown bats in the belfry?
I'm serious. It's nothing but Satan-vision on the inside.
I mean, how he's walking around in a jacket with detachable arms is beyond me.
you know, I had a brother with this many issues once.
yeah? - Know what I did?
I ate him. - Of course you did.
how are these guys even a threat?
boss says they gotta go, they gotta go. - Right.
idea. You wanna trade?
I mean, I'll take chuckles over schizo.
no, I like this one's hair better. You can stay in the big one.
all right. In that case, let's turn up the heat.
the sooner I get out of this and into something more stable, the better.
hold on.
Hey, kid. Hey. Why don't you fire up the camera on that thing?
point it over here.
shall we?
all right, everybody be cool! This is a robbery!
anybody moves, and I'll execute every last one of you!
choppin' their heads off won't kill 'em, but it'll slow 'em down pretty good.
till they fuse back up, anyhow.
well, that's something, I guess. I mean, assuming we can even get close to them.
believe me, I don't want you walking right up to 'em, either.
I'm still looking for something you can shoot at 'em.
good times. All right, thanks, Bobby.
Hey, you take mayo, right, Bobby?
you got a chick over there? - What? No.
are you even working, Richard Gere? - Shut up, you idjit.
where are you boys off to next? - Uh, St. Louis.
that's where we... - It's too late. They hit St. Louis.
Pumpkin-and-Honeybunny'd a diner there.
Connor's Diner? - Yeah. How'd you know?
lucky guess.
all right, so much for that. I guess we're off to...
to Ankeny, Iowa.
call us if you get anything else. - You got it.
special Agents Morris, Valente.
you were first on the scene? - Unfortunately.
wanna tell us what happened?
Hey, Keep that up! I didn't say you could put that down!
I want the whole world to know what Sam and Dean Winchester are capable of.
that all of 'em?
all but one. - No, please, no.
well, goodnight, St. Louis. You've been a wonderful crowd.
grab your socks and hose, Iowa,'cause we're headed to you next.
we need to alert... - Federal, state, local.I'm on it.
does this skin make me look fat?
balls.
it's pretty dark in here.
high-school dropout.
a drunk like your daddy before you.
you and dad.
now, that's a can of scorpions.
your favorite singer is Joni frickin' Mitchell?
Oh, Bobby.
you are 10 pounds of sad in a 5-pound bag.
Sam, Sam. Hold up.
don't move. Don't move.
Oh, no. This is all sorts of wrong.
those are nice wheels. Tell you what, when this is over, I'm stealing those rims.
tell the kids I said hi.
Yeah. - Bobby, we got eyes on them.
what? - It's like looking at a funhouse mirror.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
all right, well, tell me you got something. Otherwise, we're gonna have to get in close.
look, just hang back for now.
it's too late. We gotta --hang on.
hands in the air!
big misunderstanding. Look, the guys you want...
shut up! - They're right there.
shut up! Drop the phone. Put your hands in the air.
you know the thing about you, Bobby... Save it.
I already know me, handsome.
you got the gruff thing down.
seen more death than an electric chair.
ready to die with your boots on.
but, you know, deep down inside... you're no cynic.
you still hope.
you even got a thing for that lady upstairs.
tiny part of you thinks, maybe...after this is all done, you and miss sheriff can make your own little cabin in the woods.
that's hilarious.
you're not getting any older than tomorrow, Bobby.
why do you bother?
you a Browning fan? - Come again?
robert Browning. Poet.
you got that name rattling around up there with the rest of my thoughts and feelings?
it's kind of hard to sift through all the drunken blackouts, but --"A man's reach should exceed his grasp.
I like that.
that's actually lovely.
browning? After I eat you, I'm definitely gonna hit the library.
what the hell is that?
get it off. Get it off! Get it off!!
get it off of me!
get it off me!
Oh, sorry. Little snafu here.
okay, wasn't expecting that reaction.
what the hell was in that bucket?
look, you're making a mistake. The real killers are back at the diner, okay?
is that the best you can do? - I want my phone call.
Oh, there'll be a call, to the FBI. Take him to cell number one.
take that one to the interview room.
once they're separate and secure, you boys call it a night.
you're making a mistake!
what, did you guys forget something or what?
I have a right to my phone call. - A right?
you killed how many people last couple days, and you want me to hop-to on your rights?
I didn't --please
just give me one --one phone call.
boys? - Bobby, we got popped.
okay. I'll be there as soon as -- - No, no, there's no time. Look, we saw them...
they saw us. So, we are coming to get us. You read me?
tell me you got something.
there's a chemical --sodium borate.
okay, let me get Mr. Wizard on speed dial.
no, no, it ain't as weird as it sounds.
it's found in industrial cleaners and soaps and laundry powder.
just look for anything with the word borax on it.
you want me to "Desperate Housewife" these mothers?
no, just trust me. It burns 'em bad enough to slow 'em down.
so get the strongest you can find. Hear me?
borax. Burns. Got it.
then douse 'em, then get close, and then chop the heads off.
got it. - And keep the heads separate!
Bobby, you're a genius. Thanks. I
What'd you do that for? - Borax? Decapitation?
what kind of sickos are you and your friends?
Hey, you listen to me.
if you don't go get every ounce, every drop of whatever that stuff is in this place right now...
we're all gonna die!
well, you're crazier than I thought.
what are you doing?
what is your problem? We don't have time for lunch right now.
I was hungry. - Later. Let's go.
what is it? What happened?
I... It's just...
I don't know what I just saw.
let me out of here.
okay, you listen to me, and we'll live.
all right, keep your head down, get to the supply closet.
get anything that says borax on it --bring it here.
now. Go.
I'm not your brother.
but I am Dean adjacent.
sorry.
not Sammy.
I just want to let you know how much I've really grown to hate you and your brother since we've been wearing you.
I just don't get it.
you could be anything. You're strong. You're uninhibited.
you're smart enough, believe it or not.
but you're so caught up in being good and taking care of each other.
what do you care? - Because it pisses me off!
you're wasting a perfectly good opportunity to subjugate the weak.
cute. Really think you can get close enough to use it?
not until you're burning.
here's the deal. Dean...
thinks you're nutballs. He thinks you're off your game.
you gonna kill me, or is this some sort of "play with your food" bull?
all right. All right.
you know, I guess that's why Dean never told you that he killed Amy.
there it is. The look on your face. That is priceless!
that's what I've been waiting for.
now I can eat you.
cause, you see, I like my meat a little bitter.
well, that felt good.
so... the FBI is on the way.
Yeah, listen, about that... whatever I can do...
especially if it involves lying about everything I just saw.
good. I was hoping you could help us kind of... be dead.
you know, quote unquote.
Yeah. Yeah, I should be able to swing that.
all right.
come on, let's grab a mop.
Sammy? You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
let's go.
that's when I got the drop on them and shot them both.
you did good, sheriff.
here's the files. Cause of death --multiple gunshot wounds.
I fingerprinted them first, of course, for your records.
mind if we take a look at the bodies?
their bodies were sent to the funeral home for cremation, as per their living wills and religious requirements.
that must be some kind of record. They died last night.
you can contact the funeral home. They might still have the bodies.
as you know, once we do the autopsy, we're obliged to release
you had the bodies destroyed?
what kind of backwater operation is this?
Hey! Easy. Forget about it.
no bodies, no paperwork, right? Someone once told me that was a good thing.
the good news still stands. This case is closed.
Sam and Dean Winchester are dead.
the Winchester crime spree has come to a violent end in Iowa, where they were gunned down.
that should take the heat off. For now.
Thanks, Jody. Couldn't have done it without you.
anytime you need me to spill something else, you give me a call.
actually, there is one more thing.
don't open it. Even if it starts talking.
especially if it starts talking.
when you cross over Underhill Bridge, just toss it in the drink.
if you'll excuse me, I,um... I got a body to bury in cement.
dad, seriously?
lying to the FBI, incinerating bodies, and this stuff?
what the hell is it? 'Cause it sure isn't blood.
you're right about that, sweetie. It's much more than blood.
I can explain. - Don't bother.
it's valente.
Yes, sir, I'm with them now.
well, unfortunately, their heads are... missing.
but the actual Winchesters are dead, yes?
no, sir. They're in the wind.
so, all that brainpower, all those resources, and those two field mice are still on my to-do list?
I'm sorry, sir.
we could grab some more DNA and double them again.
I like where your head's at, but sometimes less is more.
Yes, sir.
I like a subtler approach.
back to the vision board on this one.
of course.
just secure the bodies and get back to the FBI, and we'll give this Winchester situation a good think.
definitely. Thanks, sir.
and, Valente? Next time, call me with a win.
for your sake. Please don't make me bib you.
Yes, sir.
I'm craving a latte.
you mind running across the street before we hit the trail?
decaf, two pumps of vanilla, and grab yourself whatever you want --my treat.
Mr. Roman.
I felt it was time we met in person.
I'm Crowley. I run hell.
Yes, yes. Of course.
I agree, 100%. High time we met.
a token.
you shouldn't have. I love a muffin.
100% organic baby uvulas --gluten free.
so considerate.
I'll cut to the chase, Mr. Roman.
please. Dick.
you think? - I know.
straight talk --we should be friends, you and I.
Why? Why in the world would we be?
well, I brought you here... Dick.
I found the way to open the door to Purgatory.
to steal every last soul, you mean.
you and that angel friend of yours. Don't roofie me and call it romance.
I think you've got me wrong.
now it's your turn to listen.
I'd sooner swim through hot garbage than shake hands with a bottom-feeding mutation like you.
you demons are ugly, lazy, gold-digging whores.
you're less than humans, and they're not good for much till you dip 'em in garlic sauce.
I'd never work with you, Crowley.
in fact, if I wasn't busy with better things, I might actively wipe your kind from the face of the Universe.
and you'd deserve it.
are we clear?
keep the muffins.
are you sure you want to dump these things?
I'm thinking they might actually come in handy down the road.
what do you think?
what? What is it? Talk.
nothing.
well, that's convincing.
did monster-us give you the jeebs, huh?
cause I gotta be honest --I ain't looking in the mirror for --for a while myself.
okay.
you really want to know what's wrong?
Yeah. Yeah, you know my motto --here to help.
here to help.
kind of like you helped Amy?
listen, Sam... - Don't...don't lie to me again.
no, don't even talk to me.
Yeah, I can't.
you know what, Dean? I can't.
you can't what? - I can't talk to you right now!
Dean, I can't even be around you right now!
okay, so... - I think you should just go on without me.
go.
all right.
sorry, Sam.
you're not sleeping, you drink for the record.
just be honest with me.
how are those the actions of someone who knows they did the right thing?
you lied to me, and you killed my friend.
killing Amy was not wrong.
you couldn't do it, so I did.
you know, I can't even be around you right now.
you might as well bite the bullet and work with me on this one.
I don't know if I can.
I'm just saying, let's try and stop the killings.
that's your stuff.
Yeah. Yeah. I figured we'd take one car.
look, you know what? You were right.
about Amy. I get why you did it.
you were just trying to make sure no one else got hurt.
supernatural.
you're saying this is a book?
books. It was a series.
didn't sell a lot of copies, though.
Chuck, I am your number-one fan.
but I know that "Supernatural" Is just a book, okay?
Becky, it's all real. - I knew it!
you okay, lady? Is it really you?
can you... Quit touching me? - No.
okay, you won't believe it.
people think I just say it to get a bigger tip.
try me.
fine. I'm in grad school.
see? Okay? There's a look.
okay? Stop.
no, this is my "I dig smart chicks" Look.
now, if they, uh, if they wore that, I wouldn't have dropped out of school.
so, what's your deal?
my deal?
Yeah.
you came in here looking like somebody shot your puppy.
well, things are looking up now that your shift's over.
all right.
uh, here's the deal.
I have this friend. He's got this younger brother.
right? Cannon's a little loose.
you know, his reactor blew a while back.
it's not good.
my friend -- he's, uh... He's kind of been sitting, waiting to see if he goes guano again.
and I assume it just hit the fan?
well, that's the thing. It didn't.
the kid's all reasonable now, considering he's crazy.
well, he's -- I mean, he's not crazy. He's starting to seem like things might be getting a little better.
well, that's a good thing, right?
it's a freaking miracle.
except...
when it happens during their sacred annual pilgrimage to Vegas.
and he goes off on some Granola-munching hike in the desert by himself.
well, maybe he just needs some time alone.
Yeah.
we all need to face ourselves sometime.
maybe he does.
wasn't talking about him.
excuse me.
speak of the devil.
he's four blocks away?
see? Baby bro needs you after all.
Dean.
it's okay. You won't need that.
come on. - I thought you were out, uh, becoming one with the land or some crap.
you got to -- come here.
all right.
now...
what is this?
uh, apparently, uh, pink is for loyalty.
all right, so, what's the pretext?
what are we -- uh, wedding crashers, huh?
we looking for some kind of siren or what?
no. Nothing like that. All right, um...
so, a little sudden.
but life is short, so I'll keep this shorter.
I'm in love.
and I'm getting married.
say something, like, uh, like, "Congratulations," for example.
what?
what the hell?
Becky?
Dean.
I'm so glad you're here.
shouldn't she ask for my permission or something?
y-you want her to ask for my hand?
how in the
how did this happen?
short version?
we -- we -- we met.
we ate and -- and talked and fell in love.
and, you know, here we are.
Yeah, I-I guess I'm all caught up.
that's -- okay.
you know what? Ignoring everything...
have you forgotten the average life-span of your hookups?
Yeah, but
but if anyone knows that, it's me.
I mean, I read every book.
so, open eyes, you know?
open eyes.
I'm going to be sick.
Dean, look, it's simple.
I-if something good's happening, I-I got to jump on it
now, today, period.
okay, "Dead poets society." fine.
no offense -- did you make sure she's even really
salt, holy water, everything.
see?
not a monster.
just the right girl for your brother.
that's it.
the bill.
I got it.
you two do your brother thing.
Really?! Super fan ninety-nine?!
Dean, look.
honest to god, I-I had the exact same opinion of her as you do.
but when we got past the whole book thing, I found out t-that she's great and I was the dick.
Yeah, you know, speaking of the whole, uh, book thing...
Becky randomly shows up during Vegas week?
Yeah.
Yeah.
okay, um, what are you trying to say?
I'm saying maybe she knew you were going to be here.
maybe, uh, uh, uh, Chuck wrote about it.
Dean, you're paranoid. - And you're in love?!
it's been four days, man!
you know what, Dean? You know what?
um, how about this?
Becky and I are going to go up to her place in Delaware.
um, why don't you try and wrap your dome around this, get a little supportive, then give us a call?
first official tweet as Mrs. Becky Rosen-Winchester.
Bobby. Hey, I know you're, uh, beard-deep in that Oregon nest.
I am headed to Delaware to do a little snoop around.
Sam is there with his wife.
that's right. You heard me. His wife.
call me.
I thought we just ate.
quick stop.
well, is that my fault?
I told you we had tickets 11 times.
Hi, Jocelyn.
let me call you back.
just get a sitter. It's not calculus.
Yes. Can I help you?
it's Becky. Becky Rosen.
Yechie Becky.
ha. Long time ago.
Yechie Becky!
well, you look just the same, don't you?
I'm here to R. S.V. P. for the reunion, if it's not too late.
no, no, there is always room for one more.
actually...
it's Rosen-Winchester.
so mark me down "Plus one.
Jocelyn Caruso roasted.
Hi, Guy!
you're back!
how was Vegas?
it was awesome!
Really? Really?
guy...
meet my husband...
Sam.
Hey.
it's an honor to meet you, Sam.
Thanks. You too.
guy's a really good friend.
we met in the erotic horror section at the novel hovel.
Oh, my god, Becky. Come on!
T. M.I.
poor guy's just met me.
no, it's okay. Nice to meet you.
look, any friend of Becky's...
anyway, I should, uh, get back to it, or this party's not going to happen, right?
sure.
guy's an event planner.
reunion season is very busy for him.
hold on one sec?
one more thing.
you get my message?
of course. I thought you'd never ask.
give me a hug.
I swear, if everyone had a wiccan in their pocket, the world would be a happier place.
it is nothing.
blessed be, sweetie.
Wow. Y-you look n-nice.
Thanks!
I was, you know...
saving it.
to us.
to us.
Sam? Are you okay?
Sammy, honey, what's wrong?
Becky? W-why am I...
what am I doing here?
we're celebrating, dear.
remember?
Yeah, yeah, of course.
to us.
feeling better, honey?
now that I'm with you.
me being supportive.
congratulations to you and the missus.
Thanks.
it's a waffle iron. Nonstick.
Yeah, you just, uh, you know...
I actually don't know how to use it. Are we good?
good, 'cause I'm sniffing a case in this town.
the score is...
guy wins Powerball, gets squished by a truck...
second guy went from the bench to the majors.
Oh, and one week later,
his face was the catcher's mitt, huh?
our first thought was crossroads demons, but there's that 10-year time frame on collecting souls.
then there's cursed object, like in "Bad day at black rock,
but we haven't been able to connect the vices yet.
you're working this case... together?
Yeah. I know. Right?
I mean, I guess all those Chuck Shurley books paid off.
all right, listen, cookie,
I don't know what kind of mojo you're working, but, believe me, I will find out.
Dean, that's...my wife you're talking to.
you're not even acting like yourself, Sam!
how am I not?
you married Becky Rosen!
what are you saying?
I'm a witch?
or maybe I'm a siren.
ever occur to you we're just -- I don't know -- happy?!
come on, Sam!
guy wins the lotto, guy hits the big.
all right, obviously, uh, people's dreams are coming true in this town.
don't you think this is a little bit of a coincidence?
you know what, Dean?
what Becky and I have is real.
and if you can't accept that,
that's your problem, not ours.
or maybe she's part of it.
because for whatever reason, you're her dream.
if you really do care about her, I'd be worried.
because people who do get their little fantasies or whatever seem to end up dead pretty quick.
you know, I went after her, Dean.
maybe that's what's bugging you.
that I'm moving on with my life.
I mean, you took care of me, and that's great.
but I don't need you anymore.
I don't want another hunter, Bobby. Why can't you do it?
fine.
what's his name?
I got you a present.
his and hers fake I. D?!
here. Check this out.
junior salesman leapfrogs to C. E.O. at Mutual Freedom Insurance.
you think the C. E.O. is a lead?
uh, Becky?
this is...
...beautiful.
so, what do you think about the C. E.O?
let's go pretext him!
Hey. You Dean?
hmm. I thought you'd be taller.
I assume Bobby filled you in on the road.
he told me two things.
one, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory.
numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me.
but, hey, man, sticks and stones.
think I found a case.
check the headline.
first thing's first.
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!
are you trying to humiliate me?
it's Marsha with an "S-H-A,
not a "C-I-A.
thanks again.
Hey, is that your -- - Yes.
awkward.
okay.
so...
so, uh, no point in going in. Guy's clean.
you sure?
Yeah. Positive. Becky grilled him like a pro.
she's a real natural.
w-what's with the scrawny guy?
temp.
throw a rock, hit a reporter these days, eh?
well, your story's a big deal over at the, uh, the Actuarial Insider.
go ahead. Shoot.
all right.
uh... How'd you get the gig?
board came to me, asked. Said yes.
just out of the blue?
pretty much.
huh. And, uh, any idea how the board landed on you over your supervisors?
um, they didn't say.
could you tell us what specifically excited the board about your actual qualifications?
say, fellas, what's with the third degree?
Oh, uh, no offense.
we were just wondering if you got here by nefarious means.
Garth!
uh, I-I didn't mean, of course, uh, corporate backstabbing -- I'm sorry.
I meant more like,
uh, you know, black magic or hoodoo.
he jokes. He's a -- he's a jokester.
let's, uh, rewind.
why don't, uh, why don't you tell us what it felt like when your big dream came true?
look, on the record, it's great.
off the record?
it's not my big dream.
wait. You didn't want this job?
hell, no. I'm a sales guy.
I was good in sales.
your secretary's an idiot.
I'll be at the printers this afternoon.
all right, Dear. See you at dinner.
just have the idiot make a reservation.
here's a tip -- remind her she works for the C. E.O.
one more screw-up, she's fired.
your, uh, wife seems pretty stoked on the promotion, don't she?
honestly, I've never seen her happier.
I have no idea how I'm going to tell her I have to resign.
the news is just going to -- - Kill her?
Mrs. Burrows? Hi.
can I help you?
Yes, we're, uh, we're doing a story on your husband's promotion.
wanted to ask you a few questions.
I'm sorry. I can't today. If you schedule it with his girl...
okay, you know what?
I'm trying to save you from a really bad accident.
are you threatening me?
no.
no, I-I'm pointing out a pattern.
why do people keep thinking I'm threatening them?
because it sounded exactly like a threat, dude.
look, for your own good, what did you do to get him promoted?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
now leave me alone.
or do I have to call security?
no, no, no, something's not adding up.
I'm sure we'll get a break.
as soon as we're done working, romantic honeymoon getaway.
bring the damn car around.
I'm not walking five blocks in my heels.
you okay?
how did you know?
cause you're not the first. Come on.
you want to tell us what's up here?
I was having lunch with friends.
this guy heard me bitching.
next thing I know, he's making me an offer.
an offer?
Craig's job for my soul.
I know. Hilarious. I mean, what have I got to lose?
well, there's your soul.
what kind of demon deal is this? Timeline's wack.
what are you talking about? "Demon"?
let me back up here.
you made a deal with a demon in exchange for your everlasting.
except those are 10-year contracts.
Why's the bill coming due so fast?
I don't know, but I got a bad feeling about who's next.
we got to find Sam, pronto.
all right, all right, all right. Uh, here's the plan.
I drop this lady at my cousin's.
he'll stop anything trying to get her.
we, uh, find Sam, hopefully fix this, everybody's home in time for "America's got talent."
now, you -- you'll be living with a triracial paraplegic sniper until this all blows over, okay?
guy, where are you?
we need to meet up, fast!
I'm losing Sam.
Becky...
w-what's -- what's happening?
don't you remember? We're married.
Oh, g
I'm calling Dean.
Sam, do you feel concussion-y?
how many fingers am I holding up?
where am I? What the hell's going on?
Sam... Just calm down.
calm down?! You hogtied me t
Becky, why -- why am I not wearing any pants?
they're very constricting.
don't worry. I didn't do anything weird.
I was helping.
let me go. Now!
are you thirsty?
or do you need a bottle to, you know, tinkle?
it's okay if you do. I can help.
Finally!
wait. What? Wait. Becky? Becky. Hey, hey, don't!
don't! Becky!
where have you been?!
I got your messages. Problem?
big problem.
I'm at my parents' cabin.
I've got Sam tied to a bed.
I'm out of elixir. I need a refill, okay?
this isn't the honeymoon I had in mind.
well, some of it is, but not in this context.
and is it just me, or is this stuff wearing off faster and faster?!
Becky...breathe.
do you know we haven't even consummated our marriage?
we were taking it slow 'cause true love is forever, but everything just feels weird now.
all right. Meet me in an hour.
so you dosed me with a love potion.
how -- - Thin walls.
Yes, I used a social lubricant to
you roofied me!
a roofie? I'd never.
we had a great time together.
you were happy.
Oh, yeah. I'm thrilled.
I have to go.
you know your pal Guy is the one icing all those people, right?
no, he's not.
Oh, so he's not a witch?
no.
he's just a wiccan.
wiccans are good, like Glinda of Oz.
you're not this stupid, Becky.
whatever is killing people...
it's something else.
it's never something else.
when are there ever two crazy things in town at the same time?
guy's the creep, and you're on his list.
no. He's my friend.
no, he's your dealer.
look, I don't know how much he's charging you for that Spanish fly.
nothing! He gives it to me.
and he said it wouldn't even work unless you already loved me, deep down.
it just activates it.
so you think I love you?
deep, deep down?
then untie me.
no. No!
you're still working through your emotions.
I love you, too!
on the table, next to the nametags.
guy.
why don't you take a seat?
tough day?
okay.
we can cut right to it if you like.
let's talk price.
what?
well, we're a little past the freebie stage, don't you think?
but I thought we were besties.
Oh, honey.
that is so depressingly "Becky."
I mean, it's -- you're so pathetic, it actually loops back around again to cute.
okay. You want me to pay, fine.
do you accept personal checks?
no.
but I will take your soul.
you're a crossroads demon.
bingo, bingo!
I love reunions.
the desperation!
these schlubs will sign on the dotted line for money, power, hair
whatever it takes to impress the nostalgically bangable head cheerleader.
Sam was right.
you killed those people.
but for legal reasons, let's just say they had...
unfortunate accidents.
so, what, I hand over my soul, and the next day a piano falls on my head?
no, I'd never do that to you.
I promise.
I'm not stupid.
but you are special.
I am?
I wasn't thrilled to see your new hubby was Sam freaking Winchester.
I mean, if he knew that I was here talking to you, I mean, he'd probably
gank your ass. - Yes!
and I'm very protective of my ass.
it's one of my best features.
Becky, I'm prepared to offer you a one-time-only deal.
not 10 years.
25
no pianos, guaranteed.
just Sam.
for my soul.
and your promise to not breathe a word about this to the Winchesters,
and I'll be on my merry way.
no one gets a deal like this, Becky.
not kings, not popes.
I snap my fingers, and Sam will love you for the rest of your life.
I think I'll have that drink now.
anything?
uh, she's got 11 twitters.
last post
going on romantic trip with Hubster!!!
three exclamation points.
I guess she got excited.
that look romantic to you?
Oh, hell, no.
but I got this thing about fish.
dead eyes, man.
this is not how I imagined spending my reunion.
I was going to show you off
not that anyone actually knows who you are.
Supernatural" is not exactly popular, but you're tall and nice and they'd all think I was happy.
you're mad. I get it.
but can we talk?
I know you don't love me.
I know what I am, okay?
I'm a loser.
in school, in life.
guess that's why I like you so much.
What?!
I mean, not that you're a loser, but you had that whole character arc about being a freak, and I can relate.
honestly, the only place people understood me was the message boards.
they were grumpy and overly literal, but at least we shared a common passion.
and I'll take it, you know?
then I met you guys
the real Sam and Dean.
and I started dating Chuck.
and everything was amazing.
but you left, and Chuck dumped me.
I think I intimidated him with my vibrant sexuality.
I just want someone who loves me for me!
is that too much to ask?
what?
if you want somebody to love you for you, maybe don't drug them.
but I want you!
and this is the only way!
Becky.
Becky, you're better than this.
that's sweet, but I'm not so sure.
Becks!
you missed the party.
Yeah. Well...
weird night.
so, what are we thinking?
okay.
I'm in.
you're making the right choice.
I know.
so...
we seal the deal with a kiss?
exactly.
pucker up, sweetheart.
I'm not your sweetheart!
blueberry vodka.
the answer to all of life's problems.
you see that, Sam?!
I did it just like we said!
I am awesome! I
I'll be over here.
Dean Winchester.
this is really thrilling.
Hey, can I have your autograph?
sure.
Yeah, I'll, uh, carve it into your spleen.
so, how you running your little scam?
well, how do you mean, Dean?
signing 10-year deals, snuffing them that week.
well, I would never. No.
rules of the road
can't lay a hair on any of my clients.
right. So how you cheating it?
I'm not a cheater. I'm an innovator.
it's called a loophole, you moron.
Yes, when a person bargains away his soul, he gets a decade, technically.
but accidents happen.
so you're arranging "accidents" and collecting early?
Oh, please. White gloves.
I don't get my hands dirty.
that's why it's important to have a capable intern.
what time did I ask you to be here?!
what time did I ask you to be here?!
Exorcizamus te, omnis
Becky...run!
how many deals you got cooking in this town, Madoff?
15
Yeah, well, call them off, or I'll cut my own loophole in your throat.
Oh, crap.
Yeah, you said it. You're in a world
Hello, boys.
Oh, crap.
Sam, mazel tov. Who's the lucky lady?
you're Crowley!
and you're
well, I'm sure you have a wonderful personality, dear.
Ah, another step, and I'll Colombian necktie your little friend here.
please, don't let him get off that easy.
sir, I don't think that you
I know exactly what you've been doing.
a little birdie named Jackson sold you out, e-mailed all the juicy deed to my suggestion box.
I assume that's my whistle-blower?
shame. Had a future.
unfortunately, you don't.
I was just -- - There's only one rule
make a deal, keep it.
well, technically, I didn't
there's a reason we don't call our chits in early
consumer confidence.
this isn't Wall Street! This is hell!
we have a little something called integrity.
this gets out, who'll deal with us? Nobody!
then where are we?!
I don't know.
that's right. You don't.
because you're a stupid, shortsighted little prat.
now, hand the jackass over.
I'll cancel every deal he's made.
what are you going to do with him?
make an example of him.
fair trade, right?
we all go our separate ways.
no harm done.
what, out of the goodness of your heart?
years of demons nipping at your heels, haven't seen one for months. Wonder why?
we've been a little busy.
hunting Leviathan -- yes, I know.
that's why I told my lads to stay clear of you meatheads.
so, what do you know about
too much. You met that dick yet?
smuggest tub of goo since Mussolini.
I hate the bastards.
squash them all, please.
I'll stay clear.
rip up the contracts first.
Done...and done.
your turn.
no, no, no, no. Let
pleasure, gentlemen.
What'd I miss?
it...
it wasn't all bad, right?
okay, y-you did save my life, and for that, thanks.
so, I'll see you again?
Yeah, probably not.
Becky, look.
you're not a loser, okay?
you're a good person, a-and you've got a lot of e-energy.
so, you know, just do your thing, whatever that is, and the right guy will find you.
no.
no.
well, buddy, I got to say, man
you, uh... you don't suck.
thank you.
that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
Yeah. All right, that's
thank you.
take care.
Aw, you made a friend.
look, man, uh...when I was all dosed up, I-I said some crap.
Oh, you mean, she -- she wasn't your soul mate?
shut up.
I mean, I do need you watching my back.
obviously.
Yeah, when, uh, crazy groupies attack.
you know what I mean.
you know, I got to say, man...
for a wack job, you really pulled it together.
that's the nicest thing anyone's said to me.
look, don't be too impressed, man.
it's still a Denver scramble up here.
I just know my way around the plate now.
I'm just saying.
it's stupid to think that you need me around all the time.
you're a grown-up.
right.
you're a hike-in-the-desert, hippie-douche grown-up.
dude, I was camping. You camp.
Yeah, whatever. Hippie.
you know what, though? Seriously?
it might be nice. - What?
I mean, you basically have been looking out for me
your whole life.
now you finally get to take care of yourself.
about time, huh?
Yeah.
right.
you can't just look me in the face and tell me you're fine.
you're not sleeping, you drink for the record. Just be honest with me.
how are those the actions of someone who knows they did the right thing?
you lied to me, and you killed my friend.
killing Amy was not wrong. You couldn't do it, so I did.
you know, I can't even be around you right now.
you might as well bite the bullet and work with me on this one.
I don't know if I can. - I'm just saying, let's try and stop the killings.
that's your stuff. - Yeah. Yeah. I figured we' take one car.
look, you know what. You were right, about Amy.
I get why you did it. You were just trying to make sure no else got hurt.
supernatural.
you're saying this is a book? - Books. It was a series.
didn't sell a lot of copies, though.
Chuck, I am your number-one fan.
but I know that "Supernatural" is just a book, okay?
Becky, it's all real. - I knew it!
you okay, lady? - Is it really you?
can you... Quit touching me? - No.
okay, you won't believe it. People think I just say it to get a bigger tip.
try me. Fine. - I'm in grad school.
see? Okay? There's a look. Okay? Stop.
no, this is my "I dig smart chicks" look.
now, if they, uh, if they wore that, I...
I wouldn't have dropped out of school.
so, what's your deal?
my deal? - Yeah. Okay?
you came in here looking like somebody shot your puppy.
well, things are looking up now that your shift's over.
all right.
uh, here's the deal. I have this friend.
he's got this younger brother. Right?
cannon's a little loose.
you know, his reactor blew a while back. It's not good.
my friend... he's, uh...
he's kind of been sitting, waiting to see if he goes guano again.
and I assume it just hit the fan? - Well, that's the thing. It didn't.
the kid's all reasonable now, considering he's crazy.
well, he's... I mean, he's not crazy. He...
he's starting to seem like things might be getting a little better.
well, that's a good thing, right? - It's a freakin' miracle. Except...
when it happens during their, uh...
their sacred annual pilgrimage to Vegas...
and he goes off on some granola-munching hike in the desert by himself.
well, maybe he just needs some time alone. - Yeah.
we all need to face ourselves sometime.
maybe he does.
wasn't talking about him.
excuse me.
speak of the devil.
he's four blocks away?
see? Baby bro needs you after all.
it's okay. You won't need that. Come on.
I thought you were out, uh, becoming one with the land or some crap.
you got to... come here. All right.
now...
Hi. What is this?
uh, apparently, uh, pink is for loyalty.
all right, so, what's the pretext? What are we... uh, wedding crashers, huh?
we lookin' for some kind of siren or what? - No. Nothing like that.
all right, um... So, a little sudden.
but life is short, so I'll keep this shorter.
I'm in love.
and I'm getting married.
say something, like, uh, like,"congratulations," for example.
what?
what the hell?
I'm so glad you're here.
shouldn't she ask for my permission or something?
y-you want her to ask for my hand?
how in the... How did this happen?
short version? We... we... we met.
we ate and... and talked and fell in love.
and, you know, here we are.
Yeah, I-I guess I'm all caught up. That's...
okay. You know what? Ignoring everything...
have you forgotten the average life-span of your hookups?
Yeah, but... - but if anyone knows that, it's me.
I mean, I read every book.
so, open eyes, you know? Open eyes.
I'm gonna be sick.
Dean, look, it's simple.
I-if something good's happening, I-I got to jump on it... now, today, period.
Okay,"Dead Poets Society." Fine.
no offense... did you make sure she's even really...
salt, holy water, everything.
see? Not a monster.
just the right girl for your brother. That's it.
the bill. - I got it.
you two do your brother thing.
Really?! Superfan ninety-nine?!
Dean, look. Honest to God, I-I had the exact same opinion of her as you do.
but when we got past the whole book thing,
I found out t-that she's great and I was the dick.
Yeah, you know, speaking of the whole, uh, book thing...
Becky randomly shows up during Vegas week?
Yeah. - Yeah.
okay, um, what are you trying to say? - I'm saying maybe she knew you were gonna be here.
maybe, uh, uh, uh, Chuck wrote about it. - Dean, you're paranoid.
and you're in love?! It's been four days, man!
you know what, Dean? You know what? Um, how about this?
Becky and I are gonna go up to her place in Delaware.
um, why don't you try and wrap your dome around this, get a little supportive, then give us a call?
Bobby. Hey, I know you're, uh, beard-deep in that Oregon nest.
I am headed to Delaware to do a little snoop around.
Sam is there with his wife.
that's right. You heard me. His wife.
call me.
I thought we just ate.
quick stop.
well, is that my fault? I told you we had tickets 11 times.
Hi, Jocelyn. - Let me call you back.
just get a sitter. It's not calculus.
Yes. Can I help you?
it's Becky. Becky Rosen.
Yechie Becky.
long time ago. Yechie Becky.
well, you look just the same, don't you?
I'm here to R. S.V. P.for the reunion, if it's not too late.
no, no, there is always room for one more.
actually...
it's Rosen-Winchester.
so mark me down "plus one.
Jocelyn Caruso roasted.
Hi, guy! - You're back!
how was Vegas? - It was awesome!
Really? Really?
guy... Meet my husband... Sam.
Hey.
it's an honor to meet you, Sam. - Thanks. You too.
guy's a really good friend.
we met in the erotic horror section at the novel hovel.
Oh, my God, Becky. Come on!
T. M.I. Poor guy's just met me.
no, it's okay. Nice to meet you.
look, any friend of Becky's...
anyway, I should, uh, get back to it, or this party's not gonna happen, right?
sure.
guy's an event planner. Reunion season is very busy for him.
hold on one sec?
one more thing. You get my message?
of course. I thought you'd never ask.
give me a hug.
I swear, if everyone had a Wiccan in their pocket, the world would be a happier place.
it is nothing.
blessed be, sweetie.
y-you look n-nice. - Thanks!
I was, you know... Saving it.
to us. - To us.
Sam? Are you okay?
Sammy, honey, what's wrong?
Becky? W-why am I... What am I doing here?
we're celebrating, Dear. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, of course. To us.
feeling better, honey?
now that I'm with you.
me being supportive.
congratulations to you and the missus.
Thanks.
it's a waffle iron. Nonstick.
Yeah, you just, uh, you know... I actually don't know how to use it.
are we good? Good,'cause I'm sniffing a case in this town.
the score is...Guy wins Powerball, gets squished by a truck...Second guy went from the bench to the Majors.
Oh, and one week later, his face was the catcher's mitt, huh?
our first thought was crossroads demons, but there's that 10-year time frame on collecting souls.
then there's cursed object, like in "Bad day at Black Rock,
but we haven't been able to connect the vics yet.
you're working this case... Together?
Yeah. I know. Right?
I mean, I guess all those Chuck Shurley books paid off.
all right, listen, Cookie, I don't know what kind of mojo you're working, but, believe me, I will find out.
Dean, that's... my wife you're talking to.
you're not even acting like yourself, Sam!
how am I not? - You married Becky Rosen!
what are you saying? I'm a witch?
or maybe I'm a siren.
ever occur to you we're just... I don't know... happy?!
come on, Sam!
guy wins the lotto, guy hits the bigs.
all right, obviously, uh, people's dreams are coming true in this town.
don't you think this is a little bit of a coincidence?
you know what, Dean? What Becky and I have is real.
and if you can't accept that, that's your problem, not ours.
or maybe she's part of it.
because for whatever reason, you're her dream.
if you really do care about her, I'd be worried.
because people who do get their little fantasies or whatever seem to end up dead pretty quick.
you know, I went after her, Dean. Maybe that's what's bugging you...
that I'm moving on with my life.
I mean, you took care of me, and that's great.
but I don't need you anymore.
I don't want another hunter, Bobby. Why can't you do it?
fine. What's his name?
Hey.
I got you a present.
his and hers fake I. D?!
here. Check this out.
junior salesman leapfrogs to C. E.O. at Mutual Freedom Insurance.
you think the C. E.O. is a lead?
this is...
beautiful.
so, what do you think about the C. E.O?
let's go pretext him!
Hey. You Dean?
I thought you'd be taller.
I assume Bobby filled you in on the road.
he told me two things.
one, he's tangling with a major-league nest up in Oregon territory.
numero dos, he said you'd be all, uh, surly and premenstrual working with me.
but, hey, man, sticks and stones.
think I found a case. Check the headline.
first thing's first.
Oh, Marmaduke, you're crazy!
are you trying to humiliate me?
it's Marsha with an "s-h-a," not a "c-i-a.
thanks again.
Hey, is that your... - Yes.
awkward.
Hi.
okay.
so...
so, uh, no point in going in. Guy's clean.
you sure? - Yeah. Positive.
Becky grilled him like a pro. She's a real natural.
w-what's with the scrawny guy?
temp.
throw a rock, hit a reporter these days, eh?
well, your story's a big deal over at the, uh, the Actuarial Insider.
go ahead. Shoot.
all right. Uh... How'd you get the gig?
board came to me, asked. Said yes.
just out of the blue? - Pretty much.
and, uh, any idea how the board landed on you over your supervisors?
um, they didn't say.
could you tell us what specifically excited the board about your actual qualifications?
say, fellas, what's with the third degree?
Oh, uh, no offense. We were just wondering if you got here by nefarious means.
uh, I-I didn't mean, of course, uh, corporate backstabbing...
I'm sorry. I meant more like, uh, you know, black magic or hoodoo.
he jokes. He's a...
he's a jokester. Let's, uh, rewind.
why don't, uh, why don't you tell us what it felt like when your big dream came true?
look, on the record, it's great.
off the record? - It's not my big dream.
wait. You didn't want this job?
hell, no. I'm a sales guy.
I was good in sales.
your secretary's an idiot. I'll be at the printers this afternoon.
all right, dear. See you at dinner.
just have the idiot make a reservation.
here's a tip... remind her she works for the C. E.O.
one more screw-up, she's fired.
your, uh, wife seems pretty stoked on the promotion, don't she?
honestly, I've never seen her happier.
I have no idea how I'm gonna tell her I have to resign.
the news is just gonna... - Kill her?
Mrs. Burrows? Hi. - Can I help you?
Yes, we're, uh, we're doing a story on your husband's promotion. Wanted to ask you a few questions.
I'm sorry. I can't today. If you schedule it with his girl...
okay, you know what? I'm trying to save you from a really bad accident.
are you threatening me? - No.
no, I-I'm pointing out a pattern. Why do people keep thinking I'm threatening them?
because it sounded exactly like a threat, dude.
look, for your own good, what did you do to get him promoted?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
now leave me alone. Or do I have to call security?
no, no, no, something's not adding up.
I'm sure we'll get a break.
as soon as we're done working, romantic honeymoon getaway.
bring the damn car around.
I'm not walking five blocks in my heels.
you okay?
how did you know?
cause you're not the first. Come on.
you want to tell us what's up here?
I was having lunch with friends.
this guy heard me bitching.
Craig's job for my soul.
I know. Hilarious. I mean, what have I got to lose?
well, there's your soul.
what kind of demon deal is this? Timeline's wack.
what are you talking about? "Demon"? - Let me back up here.
you made a deal with a demon in exchange for your everlasting.
except those are 10-year contracts. Why's the bill coming due so fast?
I don't know, but I got a bad feeling about who's next. We got to find Sam, pronto.
all right, all right, all right. Uh, here's the plan.
I drop this lady at my cousin's. He'll stop anything trying to get her.
we, uh, find Sam, hopefully fix this, everybody's home in time for "America's Got Talent.
now, you... you'll be living with a triracial paraplegic sniper until this all blows over, okay?
guy, where are you? We need to meet up, fast!
I'm losing Sam.
Becky... W-what's... what's happening?
don't you remember? We're married.
Oh, g...I'm calling Dean.
Sam, do you feel concussion-y? How many fingers am I holding up?
where am I? What the hell's going on?
Sam... Just calm down.
calm down?! You hogtied me t...
Becky, why...why am I not wearing any pants?
they're very constricting.
don't worry. I didn't do anything weird.
I was helping. - Let me go. Now!
are you thirsty? Or do you need a bottle... To, you know, tinkle?
it's okay if you do. I can help.
Finally! - Wait. What? Wait.
Becky? Becky. Hey, hey, don't! Don't! Becky!
where have you been?! - I got your messages.
problem? - Big problem.
I'm at my parents' cabin.
I've got Sam tied to a bed. I'm out of elixir.
I need a refill, okay?
this isn't the honeymoon I had in mind.
well, some of it is, but not in this context.
and is it just me, or is this stuff wearing off faster and faster?!
Becky... Breathe.
do you know we haven't even consummated our marriage?
we were taking it slow 'cause true love is forever, but everything just feels weird now.
all right. Meet me in an hour.
so you dosed me with a love potion.
how... - Thin walls.
look... Yes, I used a social lubricant to...
you roofied me!
a roofie? I'd never.
we had a great time together. You were happy.
Oh, yeah. I'm thrilled.
I have to go.
you know your pal guy is the one icing all those people, right?
no, he's not.
Oh, so he's not a witch? - No.
he's just a wiccan.
wiccans are good, like Glinda of Oz.
you're not this stupid, Becky.
whatever is killing people...
it's something else. - It's never something else.
when are there ever two crazy things in town at the same time?
guy's the creep, and you're on his list.
no. He's my friend.
no, he's your dealer.
look, I don't know how much he's charging you for that Spanish fly...
nothing! He gives it to me.
and he said it wouldn't even work unless you already loved me, deep down.
it just activates it.
so you think I love you?
deep, deep down? - Then untie me.
no. No!
you're still working through your emotions.
I love you, too!
on the table, next to the nametags.
why don't you take a seat?
tough day?
okay.
we can cut right to it if you like.
let's talk price. - What?
well, we're a little past the freebie stage, don't you think?
but I thought we were besties.
Ohh, honey.
that is so depressingly "Becky." I mean, it's...
you're so pathetic, it actually loops back around again to cute.
okay. You want me to pay, fine.
do you accept personal checks?
no. But I will take your soul.
you're a crossroads demon. - Bingo, bango!
I love reunions. The desperation!
these schlubs will sign on the dotted line for money, power, hair...
whatever it takes to impress the nostalgically bangable head cheerleader.
Sam was right. You killed those people.
but for legal reasons, let's just say they had... unfortunate accidents.
so, what, I hand over my soul, and the next day a piano falls on my head?
no, I'd never do that to you. I promise.
I'm not stupid. - But you are special.
I am?
I wasn't thrilled to see your new hubby was Sam freakin' Winchester.
I mean, if he knew that I was here talking to you, I mean, he'd probably...
gank your ass. - Yes!
and I'm very protective of my ass. It's one of my best features.
Becky, I'm prepared to offer you a one-time-only deal.
not 10 years. 25
no pianos, guaranteed.
just Sam.
for my soul.
and your promise to not breathe a word about this to the Winchesters, and I'll be on my merry way.
no one gets a deal like this, Becky.
not Kings, not Popes.
I snap my fingers, and Sam will love you for the rest of your life.
I think I'll have that drink now.
anything?
she's got 11 Twitter... Ers.
last post... "Going on romantic trip with hubster!!!
three exclamation points. I guess she got excited.
that look romantic to you? - Oh, hell, no.
but I got this thing about fish.
dead eyes, man.
this is not how I imagined spending my reunion.
I was gonna show you off...
not that anyone actually knows who you are.
Supernatural" is not exactly popular, but...
you're tall... and nice and...
they'd all think I was happy.
you're mad. I get it.
but... Can we talk?
I know you don't love me. I know what I am, okay?
I'm a loser.
in school, in life.
guess that's why I like you so much. - What?!
I mean, not that you're a loser, but you had that whole character arc about being a freak, and...
I can relate.
honestly...
the only place people understood me was the message boards.
they were grumpy and overly literal, but at least we shared a common passion.
and I'll take it, you know?
then I met you guys... the real Sam and Dean.
and I started dating Chuck.
and everything was... Amazing.
but you left, and Chuck dumped me.
I think I intimidated him with my vibrant sexuality.
I just want someone who loves me for me!
is that too much to ask?
what?
if you want somebody to love you for you, maybe don't drug them.
but I want you!
and this is the only way!
Becky, you're better than this.
that's sweet, but... I'm not so sure.
Becks! You missed the party.
Yeah. Well... Weird night.
so, what are we thinking?
okay.
I'm in.
you're making the right choice. - I know.
so... We seal the deal with a kiss?
exactly. Pucker up, sweetheart.
I'm not your sweetheart!
blueberry vodka. The answer to all of life's problems.
you see that, Sam?! I did it just like we said!
I am awesome! I... I'll be over here.
Dean Winchester. This is really thrilling.
Hey, can I have your autograph?
sure.
Yeah, I'll, uh, carve it into your spleen.
so, how you running your little scam?
how do you mean, Dean?
signing 10-year deals, snuffing 'em that week.
well, I would never. No.
rules of the road... can't lay a hair on any of my clients.
right. So how you cheating it?
I'm not a cheater. I'm an innovator.
it's called a loophole, you moron.
Yes, when a person bargains away his soul, he gets a decade, technically.
but accidents happen.
so you're arranging "accidents" and collecting early?
Oh, please. White gloves.
I don't get my hands dirty.
that's why it's important to have a capable intern.
what time did I ask you to be here?!
what time did I ask you to be here?!
Becky... Run!
how many deals you got cooking in this town, Madoff? - 15
Yeah, well, call them off, or I'll cut my own loophole in your throat.
Oh, crap.
Yeah, you said it. You're in a world...
Hello, boys.
Oh, crap.
Sam, mazel tov. Who's the lucky lady?
you're Crowley!
and you're...
I'm sure you have a wonderful personality, dear.
Ah, another step, and I'll Colombian necktie your little friend here.
please, don't let him get off that easy.
sir, I don't think that you...
I know exactly what you've been doing.
a little birdie named Jackson sold you out, e-mailed all the juicy deets to my suggestion box.
I assume... That's my whistle-blower?
shame. Had a future.
unfortunately, you don't.
I was just... - there's only one rule...
make a deal, keep it.
well, technically, I didn't...
there's a reason we don't call our chits in early... consumer confidence.
this isn't Wall Street! This is hell!
we have a little something called integrity.
this gets out, who'll deal with us? Nobody!
then where are we?!
I don't know. - That's right. You don't.
because you're a stupid, shortsighted little prat.
now, hand the jackass over. I'll cancel every deal he's made.
what are you gonna do with him? - Make an example of him.
fair trade, right?
we all go our separate ways. No harm done.
what, out of the goodness of your heart?
years of demons nipping at your heels, haven't seen one for months.
wonder why? - We've been a little busy.
hunting Leviathan... yes, I know.
that's why I told my lads to stay clear of you meatheads.
so, what do you know about... - too much.
you met that dick yet?
smuggest tub of goo since Mussolini.
I hate the bastards.
squash 'em all, please.
I'll stay clear.
rip up the contracts first.
done... And done.
your turn.
no, no, no, no. Let...
pleasure, gentlemen.
What'd I miss?
it... It wasn't all bad, right?
okay, y-you did save my life, and for that, thanks.
so, I'll see you again?
Yeah, probably not.
Becky, look.
you're not a loser, okay?
you're a good person, a-and you've got...
a lot of...
e-energy.
so, you know, just do your thing, whatever that is, and the right guy will find you.
no. No.
well, buddy, I got to say, man... you, uh...
you don't suck.
thank you.
that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
well...
Oh. Yeah.
all right, that's... thank you.
take care.
Aw, you made a friend.
look, man, uh...
when I was all dosed up, I-I said some crap.
Oh, you mean, she... she wasn't your soul mate?
shut up. I mean,
I do need you watching my back. Obviously.
Yeah, when, uh, crazy groupies attack.
you know what I mean.
you know, I got to say, man...
for a wackjob, you really pulled it together.
that's the nicest thing anyone's said to me.
look, don't be too impressed, man.
it's still a Denver scramble up here. I just know my way around the plate now.
I'm just saying.
it's stupid to think that you need me around all the time.
you're a grown-up. - Right.
you're a hike-in-the-desert, hippie-douche grown-up.
dude, I was camping. You camp.
Yeah, whatever. Hippie.
you know what, though? Seriously? It might be nice.
what?
I mean, you basically have been looking out for me your whole life.
now you finally get to take care of yourself.
about time, huh?
Yeah. Right.
you look horrific. When was the last time you really slept a night?
let's just work, all right?
killer clown. I know what you're thinking, Sam.
why did it have to be clowns?
give me a break.
you didn't think I remembered, did you?
come on, you still bust out crying whenever you see Ronald McDonald on the television.
at least I'm not afraid of flying. - Planes crash.
and apparently clowns kill.
it's okay. They can't hurt you. They can't hurt you.
if it bleeds, you can kill it.
Yeah. "If it bleeds, you can kill it.
Hello?
I am the eggman.
seriously, Frank, pay phones?
I mean, come on. I'm getting the clap off this thing just touching it.
Fred Savage? Really?
Yeah, no, I know, big mouths are everywhere.
uh, well, since you asked, some actual intel on the Dick Roman guy would be nice.
fine. All right.
Yeah, good looking out.
I hope he finds something quick.
this whole protocol du jour thing's really creeping my cheese.
so, we got dick on Dick?
that's a vivid way of putting it.
you find anything on Wonder Woman? - No.
and there probably won't be. They are definitely gone.
but I might have found something over in Kansas.
all right, well, let's do it. But, uh, a few simple rules, okay?
no babies. In fact, no baby mamas.
no bars. No booze ... no hot chicks of any kind.
wait, wait, wait. Did you just say ...
you spawn a monster baby, see how quick you want to dive back in the pool.
those are not the fun kind of hickeys.
you're ... you're saying an octopus did this?
not just any octopus.
based on welt diameter, enteroctopus dofleini.
and for those of us who skipped the enteroctopus class?
giant pacific octopus.
how giant we talking, Doc? - Approximately 30 feet.
I mean, aren't... giant octopi rare around here?
yet here we are.
all right, so what happens? Guy comes home, cracks a beer, and gets... suckered to death?
obviously, this was some kind of freak fetish attack.
someone created those hickey marks, then bled the man out.
that bite look a little vamp-y to you? - Yeah, no question.
so what are we looking for?
an octovamp? A vamptopus?
that's crazy even for us, right? - It does push the envelope.
let's go chat up the widow.
we're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.
Mrs. Harper, we know this is, uh, bad timing.
but we just have a few routine questions that we need to ask you ... is that okay?
Yeah.
did the house feel any different lately?
Different...? - Anything strange.
cold spots.
uh, did you smell anything weird? Maybe sulfury?
no. Not that I can remember.
okay, we're just ticking all the boxes here.
um, what about any skeletons in your husband's closet?
skeletons? What do you mean?
can you think of anybody who would want to do him harm?
a colleague, an old flame.
the tiniest detail could really help.
you want to know what he was up to lately?
ask Stacey.
she was here the night he died.
Stacey? - Our nanny.
any other questions?
no, that's... Thank you.
you've been a big help.
really appreciate the hospitality, ma'am.
mom, dad, nanny ... boy, that is a love triangle right out of casa erotica.
course, in those, the jealous wife tends to channel her feelings more productively.
the only thing I can't wrap my mind around is ...
what, how wife lady summoned an octovamp?
more like "why?
I mean, kind of impractical, right?
all right, one of us needs to go talk to the naughty nanny.
the other one stay here, shake down the place when the wife leaves ... see what we're dealing with.
all right. I'm on the nanny. - No, I'm on the nanny.
I thought you said no hot chicks.
we don't know that she's hot.
now, uh, how would you describe your relationship with the deceased?
I don't know. Normal, I guess.
normal?
well, I mostly dealt with Debra.
there was nothing going on, if that's what you mean.
Debra said that you were at the house late the night that... That Brian died.
Yeah.
Brian was working late, so I stayed with Kelly.
she was pretty upset.
Why's that?
well, it was her birthday.
we had a party at Plucky's.
Plucky's. Why does that sound familiar?
plucky Pennywhistle's Magical Menagerie?
pizza chain for kids.
actually, more for lazy parents.
anyway, her dad showed up for five minutes, then he went back to work.
and, of course, her mom was out of town.
this stupid kid told Kelly her folks didn't really love her.
she freaked.
I was calming her down for hours.
uh, did you... notice anything weird at the house?
weird like...? - Anything. Even a bad feeling.
no, nothing like that.
actually, Kelly does have a weird thing about closets.
but it's just kid stuff.
try me.
she thinks there's a monster in her closet.
it drives everyone crazy.
hey - Hey, we talked to the wrong person. - What?
Yeah, forget the mom. Talk to the daughter.
she's mad at her dad for ditching her birthday.
so, what do you think? A birthday wish gone wrong, something like that?
I don't know. It could be.
I got a 20 on her right now.
can you get to her without tripping the AMBER Alert?
I'll try. - All right, see what you can find out.
whatcha working on there?
I know who you are.
you do?
you're the guy that talked to my mom.
that's right. I did.
something wrong?
my mom will get mad if I talk to you.
how come?
because of what I told the police.
and what did you tell the police?
I told them that I tried to warn my dad.
that the monster would get him.
Kelly. Come here! Now!
if it bleeds, you can kill it.
okay, so, the horse I get. The hoofprints, the jumping over the fence.
but, uh, what ran him through?
best thing I could tell you is something big.
so, what, like a lance?
it's sad.
lady's got to pull her friggin' 8-year-old out of school and tell him his dad's dead.
excuse me.
excuse me, ma'am?
agent Jones, FBI.
I'm sorry. I-I really need to go.
okay. Uh, just one quick question, if you don't mind.
um, was yesterday your son's birthday?
Billy's birthday? No.
why would you ask that?
nothing. Never mind.
but...
his father did take him to a friend's birthday party yesterday.
you remember a chain called Plucky Pennywhistle's?
no.
Really? Could have swore you loved those places.
no, dude, I hated them.
uh, you would dump me and go trolling for chicks.
it's not like I left you in jail. I mean, those places are supposed to be fun.
fun? Uh, they're lame.
and they smell like puke. And the ice cream is all grainy.
all right, don't have one of your episodes, okay?
I'm just saying I hit a dead end with this whole wishes-gone-wild thing, but both kids were at Plucky's day of.
look, why don't you go check out the local Plucky's and ask about this Billy kid?
look, man, w-why don't I just... Why don't I just wait for you to get back?
no can do, Hermano. I'm on my way to talk to little Billy.
why ... why ... why don't I talk to Billy... Right now?
wait, wait, wait. This isn't about your, uh, your clown thing, is it?
What?!
No!
Sammy? - No.
Yeah, what in the world did they do to you?
all right, you know what? Never mind.
just know that 99. 99% of all clowns can't hurt you. Okay?
and if it bleeds, you can kill it.
if it bleeds, you can kill it.
I'm too old for this.
welcome to Plucky's, where all your dreams are good.
could you just, uh, maybe...
just get the manager for me? Okay.
I just need you to stay sane for three more hours. Okay?
here. Finish your homework.
like I can concentrate in here.
real beauties, huh?
we rotate them out once a week. Kids love having their art on the wall.
draw your worst fear? - I know.
but we don't post the truly evil stuff ... just the standard crap like sharks and ghosts.
Jean Holiday, shift manager. - Johnson, FBI.
so tell me ...
why even ask the kids to draw creepy stuff to begin with?
it's just an exercise...
some pop psychologist came up with.
Plus, the owner's obsessed with "aiding children's development.
so, the place mat is a safe way to get kids to talk about their fears.
you know, we get them to sketch it in a little box, and ...
plucky magically transforms it into rainbows and candy.
personally, I think it's a load of hooey, but they say that if these fears run wild, then it affects kids long into their adulthood.
Yeah, I've ... I've ... I've heard that.
so, I don't know if you'll remember, but there was a kid in here yesterday named Billy Pogue for a party?
Oh, the conniption kid.
Conniption? He ... he had ... - No, no, no, not him. He was fine.
it was his dad.
he pulls the kid away before cake and presents, and I guess the kid asked to stay for another five minutes.
the dad pulls a full-frontal douchebag, starts screaming.
just embarrassed for the kid.
you a cop?
uh, yeah. I'm a Fed.
uh, what are you investigating?
couple of crazy deaths.
why, is there something you want to share?
look ... not now. Too many eyes.
come back after closing.
so, what's the lowdown with trauma town?
I can tell you this much. Neither vic was up for parent of the year.
Kelly's dad skipped her birthday, and Billy's dad pulled one of those Dick Parent scenes that makes everyone cringe.
what the hell are these? - Kid therapy.
um, you draw your worst nightmare ... poof! Plucky fixes it.
um, they hang them up on this big wall.
well, can't argue with this. Leprechauns are deadly.
okay, so, Kelly draws a monster, and then that goes after her father? That's what we're saying?
well, here's the thing. They label those.
and guess which two were missing.
well, name tag was there ... no place mat.
little miss octovamp. - Yeah. And...
so... Somehow, whatever he drew came to life and killed his dad, riding a horse.
close, but no Seabiscuit.
see, I went and had a little chat with Billy.
and he drew me this.
wait. So now unicorns are evil?
Yeah. Obviously.
great. Well, now the question is, how did a Unicorn come off a sketch and kill Billy's dad?
how's any of this happening?
well, that's it for me.
guess I'll head out.
uh, one more thing.
some kid puked in the ball pit.
it's gonna need a full sanitization.
do that, and then you can clock out.
hold on one second there, guys.
all right. Uh, thank you.
so?
the manager found the body in the ball pit. Blood everywhere.
cops have a theory?
Yeah, they think the ball washer did it.
the what? - The... ball washer.
the what? - The ball ...
look at this.
thank you, gentlemen.
that's a shark bite. - Yeah.
and, uh, judging from the radius, I'd say a 20-footer, at least.
shark Week," man. How do you not watch that?
whole week of sharks.
how much you want to bet little Omar here was scared of sharks?
and Saul the janitor is connected how? I mean, he's not related to Omar.
no.
but Saul had something he wanted to tell me.
so this isn't about ganking some dickweed parent.
more like, uh, silencing a whistle-blower?
great, so whatever we're looking for can literally fire off childhood fears at will.
watch out for evil lunch ladies. - All right.
let's comb this place.
seriously.
Dractopus.
Seabiscuit the impaler.
land shark ... what's next?
okay, Tyler, that's it. You got to take the bus from here.
but I thought ... - I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm late.
here.
stay out of trouble.
maybe... Tulpa?
no, killing's are too spread out.
true. Angel?
it's a little imaginative for the God squad, don't you think?
all right. So... What?
Yeah, I don't know. I'm tapped out.
well, whatever it is, at least we know where it is.
that's where the victims are getting picked up.
Yeah, but we swept the place last night, and nada.
I can go back. Go to the employees, maybe dig up some dirt.
what good's that gonna do? They think you're a Fed.
the one guy who was gonna rat, he got Bruce'd.
if anybody knows anything, they're not gonna tell you.
all right. Yep. That's the plan.
I'll go back... Play bad cop, really lean into them.
and...? - And...
when I'm done, then you watch them.
so if somebody freaks out, then that's our creep.
or he'll lead us closer, and you can track him.
well, what's my cover?
I don't know. Just hang back. Act normal.
Yeah, yeah. Guy in his 30s hanging out at Plucky's alone ... that's normal.
that's not pervy at all.
so, it doesn't matter what people say. We've roped it off.
I've notified the powers that be. Everyone's aware.
just no one goes in the...
Hi.
agent. I bet I know why you're here.
how's business?
turns out not even grim flippin' death can slow down the birthday fun.
we roped off the ball pit, though, until corporate can get here.
I just can't believe the machine fritzed and did Saul in like that.
Yeah, that makes two of us.
I'm gonna need to talk to some of your employees.
like who? - Like you.
howdy, friend.
giant slinky.
would have killed for one of those when I was a kid. How much?
1, 000 tickets. - American dinero. How much?
Oh, we don't take cash here at Plucky Pennywhistle's.
only tickets won through hard work and determination.
you mainlined the kool-aid, huh?
it's double-ticket Tuesday if you play skeeball.
howdy, friend!
so, where were you last night?
well, here. Obviously.
I found him.
but I was by the cash register the whole time.
there's a security camera pointed right at the counter.
the cops already looked at it.
and you heard nothing?
I heard the ball blaster. I didn't hear him.
if I did, I would have run in, of course.
Yeah, right, right. So that's your excuse.
my what?
look, I know I'm new to this job, but I'm ...
what? How new?
couple weeks. I just got promoted.
so, uh, was there a lot of competition for the gig?
I guess.
it comes with benefits.
the bosses had us all write essays about how we would do our best for the kids, and they picked me.
don't be shocked, but I actually did two semesters at college, so...
I'm not in any kind of trouble, am I?
I don't know.
why don't you tell me?
look, I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying.
and, I mean, it's not as if I'd ever do anything illegal.
sure you wouldn't.
special Agent?
I want you to know, sir, that I really appreciate what you do, and ...
quiet.
stop cheating!
you heard him. Knock it off!
jackass. - Jackass.
Tyler, soup's on.
but, mom, I don't want ... - Just eat it.
but it sucks!
Hey, why don't you cut her some slack?
what do you care? - Because I've been where you are.
your mom made you camp at a stupid Plucky's after school?
y... no. No, but my dad, he...
hauled me places.
besides, she's working a tough gig.
you know? She's exhausted.
you should take pity on the old.
and, hey, free grub.
that stuff tastes like butt. - What?
come on, it can't be that bad.
let's see here.
that is butt.
you scared of robots?
they have laser eyes. - Yes.
howdy, friend! What's your name?
lose the head.
why'd you do it?
do... What?
I think you know.
I... I got rights. You can't ...
I'm the federal government, pal. I can do whatever I want.
okay. I'll talk.
if this is about the meth lab that fireballed up in Butte, it wasn't me.
okay, it was my brother, but, um, we got the same fingerprints, and...
please. This is the best job I ever had.
all right, look, uh... - Cliff.
cliff. You're not using kids' nightmares to smoke people, are you, Cliff?
I don't... think so.
get up.
what's going on?
all right, cards up.
Yeah, we don't care that you, you know, broke bad or whatever.
but there is some seriously weird going on in there.
you mean the sub-basement.
this place has a sub-basement?
sure. Door's out back.
easy to miss if you don't know.
what's in there?
alls I know is... Me and Saul used to come in after hours sometimes and...
you ever shroom in a ball pit?
not that I... would, agents.
it was Saul. Just Saul. All alone.
anyway...
sometimes we'd hear, like, spooky stuff, through the vents...
coming up from the boiler room.
okay, kiddo. Let's go.
but somebody stole it!
so, draw another one! Okay?
we gotta go.
okay. I'm sorry.
thank you.
that place mat sucked anyway.
Dean. What? What is it?
while you were out being Dirty Harry, uh, Tyler's mom got pissy with him, and now his place mat's missing.
so, what do you think?
equals wacky corpse.
so you think she's next on the list?
all right, I'll tail them just to be safe. You ...
check the boiler room. I know. - Right.
uh, Dean, hey, uh, any idea what he drew?
robot. - Robot?
Yeah, about the size of a house.
shoots destructo beams out of its eyes.
at least I'll see it coming. - Yeah.
now, that's perfectly normal.
drop it.
now kick it over.
some pretty heavy hoodoo you got here.
there's power in fear.
and when a child draws what he's afraid of, a little of that mojo ends up on the page.
so, what, you toss it in the fire, and some bed-wetter's horror show comes to life?
I got to get something off the parent, too.
something they own.
that bit gets tricky.
well, it hasn't seemed to slow you down.
I'm just doing what I need to!
okay. Okay. I get it. Okay?
no drawing... No Iron Giant!
Oh, that b-word is still on the list!
but not tonight. Bigger fish.
what, are you gonna shoot me, Howard?
you really want a body on your hands?! Blood everywhere?!
you shut up! 'Cause I got lots of ways to take care of bullies.
don't you worry. Like that FBI guy.
he's your pal, right?
I saw you chase Cliff down.
five minutes ago, his business card was torched.
along with something from my... personal collection.
I-I-I picked it out real special for him, too.
soon as I saw him, I noticed.
he was staring at every little Plucky like it was gonna stab him or something.
guy's got a real thing about clowns.
well, hey, these are, uh, really nice dolls.
did you paint them yourself?
uh, friggin' Plucky.
plucky helps kids.
it's all I ever wanted to do.
and when the management slot opened up, I...
but they passed me over.
shocker.
no, I told them,"No one cares more than me.
but suits never listen.
so, I'm doing it my way.
so let me get this straight.
you didn't get the good parking space, so you start dropping bodies?
those parents were horrible.
they deserved what they got.
what about Saul? - Saul had a big mouth!
some guy hits on the babysitter, all of a sudden he's the world's worst dad?
a good parent puts his kids first.
and having a little girl watch her pop get ganked by the closet monster ...
that's putting her first?
in the long run, they'll all be better off.
you think so? Really? - I would have been.
so, your brother.
What'd you do to him?
it's not my fault! It's theirs!
looks to me like he drowned.
I was screaming...
but my folks... They didn't listen.
they never listened.
it was an accident. - They let him die!
I'll bet you still have nightmares.
in fact, I'll bet you haven't been in the water since.
shut up!
because you're afraid.
no!!
it wasn't my fault.
I'm sorry.
let's roll.
go ahead. Say it.
I'm sorry.
you look like you got attacked by some PCP-crazed strippers.
dude, one of them sprayed me with seltzer from his flower.
I'm s... whew. What?
nothing. Carry on.
that's... Sam...
I'm sorry for... psychologically scarring you.
which time? - Shut up. Seriously.
you know, me ditching you when we were kids, that was a dick move.
you know, the whole clown thing...
you know what, man? Honestly...
getting my ass kicked by those juggalos tonight was...
it was therapeutic.
you faced your fear. - Exactly.
and now what else could a clown possibly ever do to me? I feel good.
well, congrats.
by the way, to celebrate...
what?
No! - Yes.
did you win this? - We earned that.
I got you a little something, too, actually.
what? You said you were over it.
you can think of it as a... clown phobia sobriety chip.
there's a new leader. arising in the West.
hi Dean. It's me, Lilith.
I don't think I like you anymore.
I'm gonna put up a barrier inside your mind.
don't scratch the wall.
maybe I'm not real, but I'm not going anywhere, Sam.
aren't you full up just playing snuffleupagus with the devil all the livelong?
I don't know, Bobby. Seeing Lucifer's fine with me.
at least all my crazy's under one umbrella.
ms. Havelock, you shouldn't have come.
I needed to see it for myself... after all that tracking, all those hours we spent.
I mean, it's one thing to study them in books. It's...
do I smell menopause?
well, if it isn't the Wiccan bitch of the west.
ms. Havelock, I know you're the one that helped them find me.
my God...
not in time to save our big girl here, but still, you get a merit badge.
they caught you, you son of a bitch!
no more murders!
and you're going back to hell.
Oh, Nora, Nora...
I'm gonna scoop you out like a pumpkin.
you know that?
Yeah, your, uh, scooping days are over, Gomer.
all you got to worry about now...
is us.
you ain't the first demon we've tracked down on this safari.
that's right. As a matter of fact, I think you put us over half a dozen.
looking for Lilith in all the wrong places.
well, you're gonna help us with that.
if things are about to get messy, maybe you should meet the owner of this fleshy temple...
a puppy of a man.
you'll like him.
Jeffrey? Jeffrey, is that you?
.no.
you have to stop him. - We will. We're going to, okay?
we're gonna send that Demon back to hell.
okay.
please don't hurt me.
Jeffrey, before we can let him go...
look, the Demon knows where we can find more of his kind, okay?
see, we're hunting them... all of them.
he's not gonna give up his rolodex easy.
Jeffrey, we're gonna have to cut in to him.
that means you.
Oh, the things he made me do to those women.
whatever you have to do...
you have to do it.
please just stop this evil piece of...
and on and on and on.
frankly, he can get tedious with this whole "good and evil" thing.
you know, you were right. I like Jeffrey. He's a decent guy.
in fact, he just signed off on his temple.
she's got other lieutenants. We already know that.
we want names.
right! All right!
his name is Merrick! I swear!
you'll find him in New Orleans!
Jeffrey? Jeffrey, you awake?
Hey, you passed out. You're in shock.
he's... he's gone?
we exorcised him.
try not to move, okay? We're almost to the hospital.
your... Your brother?
my brother stayed back to clean us out of that crime scene.
there's no reason to go down for a Demon's murders.
all right. All right, take it easy.
all right, you're good to make it from here, right?
okay, Jeffrey, no demon talk in the E. R.,you understand me?
you were mugged.
okay.
uh, um, uh, thank you.
classified server"?
got to be Devereaux, right?
Hello?
thank God.
Frank, Frank, what do you got for me?
it's nice.
kind of like a men's room with beds.
hmm, avocado grime.
takes years to build up a patina like this.
what do you mean you can't find him? It's Dick Roman. Turn on CNN.
didn't you see him at that, uh, press conference in Phoenix?
the bastard's everywhere.
you sure?
no, I-I-I don't.
I don't care that they've infiltrated the luxury-boat industry, Frank.
great. Call Kanye.
Frank's still stumped on Roman? - Yeah.
all right, let's do this.
okay, um, look at the victim profiles...
same age, same hair color, body type.
the ritual mutilations line up exactly.
who down there would've let our demon out of the can?
he squealed on his superiors. We made sure of that.
I mean, he should be down under until, uh, trumpet day.
but two women killed in the last two weeks, same parts missing, I mean, same old hunting grounds, even.
all right, well, we can take a swing at it.
but you know it's all about the Leviathans now, okay?
they're the ones we need to be hunting.
Yeah, but, no... I mean, not right now.
this one's ours, Dean.
it's unfinished business, apparently.
all right.
this is unit 32.
repeat, we've got another one. That's a 187.
female, Caucasian, maybe late 30s, at the Henley Auto-Wash.
unit 32, assistance is en route.
got a real mess here, dispatch.
thanks
you know, every time we do this, I wonder if today's the day.
we walk up, flash our tin to a bunch of chompers pretending to be policemen.
I hear you.
thought you guys might show up.
it's the drummer boys, agents, uh,
Bonham...and Watts, right?
Yeah. - Yeah, absolutely.
uh, it's a pleasure to see you again, Detective...
you know what? Pardon me. Uh, what was it... Detective...
Oh, no problemo... Detective Sutton.
Sutton. - Sutton, yeah. hi
sad to say, case looks to be open again.
are you sure?
same tools.
same cuts. Same crazy.
makes sense. I mean, we didn't catch the critter last time, did we?
and no suspects? - Same as before. Very thorough.
cold-blooded.
thank you, Detective. - Anytime.
sulfur. - Damn it.
better go check on Havelock.
this is it.
internet mail order.
white magic only herbs and talismans.
you sure about that?
careful, it's still drying.
I have a friend at the sheriff's office.
I know about all the new murders.
I'm doing what I can to protect myself.
I'm also translating some very old banishments.
wow, uh, these are... these are good.
Thanks. Got an affinity.
but back then, that night in that farmhouse, I was in over my head.
I know that now, believe me. I will leave all that to the pros.
well, you helped track it down. I mean, it was some solid legwork.
when it came down to it, all I really knew was somebody who knew somebody who knew the right number to call.
and your number is not working, by the way.
right, we, uh, we've had some technical difficulties... phone issues.
it's a monster problem, really.
so, uh, you haven't had any contact? - With the Demon?
no, thank God.
I have one or two things to finish in town, and then I'm leaving.
good choice.
have you found Jeffrey yet?
who?
the man who the demon possessed.
the one you almost beat to death.
Yeah, Jeffrey. That poor bastard.
some demons tend to be sentimental, don't they?
always go back to the same host if they can.
it's a start.
I want to talk about Cinemax.
we're grown men. We pay rent. Why can't we get Cinemax?
Skinemax.
the halfway program advisers have already weighed in on that.
fine, fine.
bringing it up in group is not gon... - I said fine!
Jeffrey, you have something pretty big going down later this morning.
that's right, I guess.
um, I'm picking her up today.
I'm getting a dog... a rescue.
I had to get her spayed and shots and stuff, but they said she's ready.
jeffrey and I talked about this.
he understands that pet ownership is a privilege, not a right.
he's gonna have to show the whole house that he can handle the responsibility.
and that's what it's all about, right, Alan?
handling it.
you okay there?
surgery's a bucket of laughs, huh? You look good.
I'm sorry for the cone of shame, but we got to keep these stitches in.
okay. Okay.
come on. Come on.
okay. Look, it's okay. You're okay, you're okay.
sorry. Just had to make sure.
make sure of what... that I peed my pants today?
Aw, you scared my dog.
uh, we did not want to do that.
listen, Jeff, we got to, uh, we got to talk.
well, this is, uh... I know what it is.
look, I know it must've been, um, hard.
do you even listen to yourself?
Oh, don't bother.
what do you guys want from me?
well, um, we're pretty sure the demon that possessed you...
is back.
what?
what do you mean?
you exorcised him, right?
he's... he's supposed to be in Hell.
Jeffrey, look, please just calm down. Just have a seat, please.
I don't understand.
three more women have been murdered over the past two weeks.
no, no.
same vic profiles, same forensics, crime scene dusted with sulfur.
we've got to assume that it's him.
but we're here now, okay?
so if he comes after you, we'll nail him just like we did last time.
what was her name? - What?
the last one he killed.
uh, Anna? - Anna Paxton.
marjorie Willis. She's the next one on the list.
list? What list?
the demon used to recite it all the time, like a grocery list.
he burned it in my head...
the names of all the women he was gonna kill.
he already had his victims chosen?
and put in a line in an order.
wait. Why?
demons aren't usually into the obsessive serial-killer crap.
you know, they're more just kind of all-around evil.
why would he do this?
he said it was his job.
Jeffrey, did your, uh, guests sign in?
I'm really sorry, Alan.
they're friends of mine from my days back at the Post Office.
I didn't know they were coming. - So, what do you think?
I think we really helped mess this poor son of a bitch up.
look at him. He's got a state-assigned dad.
okay, just get them to sign in when they sign out.
uh, Jeffrey, look, I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go find Marjorie Willis, keep her on watch, okay?
don't worry. I'm gonna stay here just in case.
you're right. We just don't read anymore.
librarian, indoor gardening enthusiast, our Demon's next organ donor.
come on, Sam, talk to me. It's been months.
when you left me at the E. R., I had three smashed fingers, five teeth out, a broken wrist, nose, cheekbone, collarbone.
I had to get 160 stitches.
mugged.
the doctor on duty said it looked like I got caught in the Spanish Inquisition.
and we're the good guys.
they patched me up, mostly.
but I lost my job, my health insurance.
I just started to drink and drift, and I got lost.
had some kind of mental break.
and I started to talk... about what happened.
Aw, man. Never tell.
never... Never.
I know that now, believe me.
so, let me guess.
drunk tank to psych eval to 72-hour forced hold to a nice long stay at an institution of their choice.
Yes.
it's happened to friends of mine.
for a long time, I didn't care.
the truth was more important than where I was.
I was in no shape to cope with the outside world.
well, hey, you got out, you know? Holding it together.
and now the demon is back. - Yeah.
I'm sorry, man.
I mean it... about all of it, you know?
you saved my life.
I owe you for it. I know that.
I owe a lot of people for getting even this far.
I...
crap. - What?
if he isn't already circling the next woman, Marjorie, than I-I think I might know where he is.
he had this special place where he kept souvenirs where he nested.
why didn't you tell us this? - I didn't want to go.
you don't have to go. We'll handle it.
I do. I have to.
average annual rainfall... Hackberry, Texas..."
come on, Sam, pay attention to me. I'm bored.
civil war buff?
damn it... no service.
good girl. You stay.
here's some jerky.
stay.
thing's not gonna pee in here, is it?
um, I don't know.
so, he'd get you this far, and then he'd shut your lights out, yeah?
for some reason, he was very secretive about this place.
but after a while, he'd only really sort of cover my eyes when we walked in.
okay, you think you can get us back there?
right here in my discontinued periodicals.
Oh, that's it.
red door down the hallway.
Yeah, there is.
this must be it.
all right, stay over here. Okay?
you just stay here. Don't move.
what the hell?
Hey, all right. We're gonna get you out of here.
Hey, hey, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? But you got to stay still.
I'm pretty sure this guy's the boring sort of chubby chaser.
leave your name, number, and nightmare at the tone.
Dean, where are you? I'm scoping zero out here.
not a good sign.
surprised you haven't picked up on that yet.
it's right... There in the coroner's report.
Yeah.
in this latest round of killings, our big girls had traces of heavy tranquilizers in their blood.
Yeah, but our Demon's strong enough to make fat Betty do whatever he wants to, right?
so, why does he need the tranqs?
think he's got a bad back?
Yeah, whatever is going on here, you know that Demon's not coming back to kill anybody.
this is Special Agent Smith. Please leave your name, number...
Oh, no. That's every cellphone Dean's got.
one of them should've picked up, right? Big brother's probably dead.
shut up.
he said "shut up" to me.
that's what I'm talking about, Sam... real interaction again. I miss that.
the rapier wit, the wittier rape. Come on.
I'll be good.
I'll even help you solve your little Nancy Drew mystery or whatever.
no note.
hmm, a cellphone scrambler. But, Luci, those are illegal.
think, Sam. Maybe this has something to do with Dean's telephone blackout.
Latin... not suspicious at all.
I've never seen this spell before.
no. But you've seen this type.
demon summoning... why?
Why? To summon a demon, jackass.
start looking at who.
okay, what do you mean?
look at the page.
you know this handwriting. - I know this handwriting.
Iay, caramba! Imi cabeza!
Nora, stop it! Calm down!
what is this? What is this?
why did Jeffrey have a demon summoning in your handwriting?
everything's happening the way he said, the way he planned it.
what plan?!
you can't help... you can't change it.
hit her.
Nora, tell me what is going on.
Sam, shake her up. She knows what happened to Dean.
get this stupid cow to focus, will you?
Nora, listen to me!
whatever it is, you should be a lot more scared of me right now because I'm 2 inches away from you, and I can make you talk. Do you understand me?
it's my son.
he has my son!
what were you thinking?
I mean, why would you even help bring back a demon in the first place?
not the demon. Jeffrey!
good. You're up.
what happened? What's going on?
no one asked you to get involved, to save me, to save anyone.
what?
did you ever think that maybe I loved being possessed? Did you?
I loved the connection, the power.
and I loved him.
love of my life, actually.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
he liberated me...
started me on my true life mission.
so you're the one with the thing for all those women.
aren't you, Jeffrey?
you're a serial killer.
I was nothing before he found me...
a shadow too scared to do what I was brought here to do.
too timid to live up to my true potential.
so, what happened... redheaded mommy make you stuff birds, put on dresses?
you shouldn't trivialize other people's pain.
so, demon comes along, rides co-pilot in your skull...
teaches you how to kill.
the list... That's yours.
for years, it was just a game I would play.
every time I'd walk by one of them in the street or see one on my mail route...
there's a sound that comes from their brains.
you know that?
only I can hear it, like an evil, little steam whistle.
every time I saw one,
I'd follow her, take down her address.
but I was never gonna do anything, not till he came along.
he's the one who saved me.
and you sent him to Hell.
I kept tabs on Jeffrey after the exorcism.
I even sent him care packages in the hospital, but he never responded.
and then not long ago, he came to me.
he seemed healthy, put together, except he wanted to know if there was a way to summon the demon back.
he said he'd been doing some research.
it was mostly nonsense, but he was convinced it was possible.
you really knocked the cork out of her piehole.
I sent him away.
I told him to get some more help.
the next day He called me.
he put my son on the phone.
he had taken him from his dorm room.
I gave him everything... the ritual, the sigils.
but he kept my boy.
and then he sent me this.
my baby's ear.
he cut it off because the ritual didn't work.
that demon gave up some serious state secrets... would've gone into big lockdown now.
not so easy to bring him back up.
jeffrey didn't care. He told me to find out what went wrong or else.
finally, I found a summoning spell that would work for sure.
and that's when he said I had another job to do.
which was what?
when you came, I was supposed to send you to Jeffrey.
he left a trail of bodies to make sure of it.
blood of the exorcist"?
strongest summoning I've ever seen.
requires the blood of the exorcist who banished him... your brother.
you see? It is all part of Jeffrey's plan.
Yeah. Well... New plan.
tracking spell... Bavarian, Egyptian. I don't care... dealer's choice.
use the flesh of the body to find the body and Dean.
do you want the ear or the kid?
you're giving me the chills.
I like to think I know you pretty well.
Yeah, how do you figure?
I watched you torture an innocent man to get out a demon.
pretty charged situation... Revealing.
you guys talked about a lot, showed a lot of character.
God...
you were so desperate to fix the world back then.
it kills you...
that people keep getting hurt...
and you just can't stop it.
or I should say it's killed you, shouldn't I?
you know what? Screw you.
Hey. I was there.
I was depressed, Dean, because he was gone.
I was a wreck, an emotional shell, a drunk.
I was suicidal.
I don't usually endorse suicide, but, man, what stopped you?
it was Alan... at the house.
you're kidding me.
he's a really good rehab therapist.
really helped me focus on my goals, my attitude.
I have to say, I really benefited from the whole program.
Yeah.
a life well-lived comes from the structured pursuit of meaningful happiness.
I realized I was nothing without my demon.
then I decided I have to get him back.
I'll be right back.
Hey, there, honey. Come on.
it's a bitch of a recipe, I must admit.
no.
Oh, you sick son of a bitch.
Hello, Jeffrey.
as I live and breathe...
again.
what are you doing?
I'm thanking you, Jeffrey.
what are you doing with this half-dead piece of crap?
come into me.
we had a very special time together, didn't we, Jeffrey?
it warms my heart to see you haven't forgotten what I taught you.
you built on it.
you captured a Winchester.
you, Jeffrey... My pupil.
I don't want to be your pupil.
I want to be yours.
but I'm done with you.
my work is finished.
you can do everything now, all on your beautiful own.
no. - No?
we don't do "no." Remember, Jeffrey?
keep sawing away at your ropes, Penelope Pitstop.
we can dance standing up if you want.
so, is this what you do...
find postal workers, make 'em go postal?
I talent scout. That's all.
looking for the next generation of superstars...
before they get to hell, like Jeffrey here.
he had all the raw material...
just bubbling in there.
all I had to do was loosen the lid on his jar, show him some practical know-how.
Yeah, what about the kid?
this one?
I don't think.
not much to work with.
no natural gift.
I'll probably burn this meat off on my way to Vegas.
you've got to be kidding me!
you let go of my son!
where do you keep coming from?
Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus.
he'll be back, you know. Back in black.
go to hell.
omnis congregatio et secta diabolica, ergo,
Draco maledicte, ecclesiam tuam, secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos!
mom?
I got you.
I got you, baby.
Oh, God.
so, Jeffrey was just pretending to be the victim.
way back in that farmhouse during the exorcism, h-he was just...
acting.
he was a psychopath, Sam.
that's what they do all the time, is act.
act like they're normal, act like they're not balls-to-the-wall crazy.
you going to sleep?
damn straight. Screw consciousness... that's what I say.
no, no, Sam. No nap for you, Sammy.
Oh, come on, don't do that.
let's talk, Sam.
I always enjoyed our special little chats.
don't you want to talk?
Yeah, look at that. Something's definitely different now, isn't it?
you let me in.
you wanted me, partner.
so you think you can use your little tricks to banish me again like that?
no. I do believe I've got you, bunk buddy.
got my finger wiggling around in your brainpan.
come on, Sammy! Come on!
say it with me now.
good morning,Vietnam!
I don't want another hunter, Bobby. Why can't you do it?
fine. What's his name?
Yeah, Garth, what do you got? Better drop a dime to the FBI.
you Dean?
I thought you'd be taller.
w-what's with the scrawny guy? - Temp
Willis. FBI.
no, Garth, not me, the FBI. The real FBI!
Oh, marmaduke, you're crazy!
how are you still alive?
What'd I miss?
long ago, in these very woods, lived an old woman by the name... of Jenny Greentree.
forced out after her family was killed in a fire, she lost everything.
some say, even her humanity.
that is so sad.
it's a true story, Ray. Look.
she carved her initials into that tree... right before she died.
those are not her initials.
so, how'd she die?
one night... A blizzard hit.
she's cold. She's hungry.
nowhere to go. No one to turn to.
Jenny Greentree froze to death... Right beneath... that tree.
and her evil spirit has haunted these woods ever since.
don't do that!
you guys should have seen your faces.
what the hell, Trevor? That's not funny, man.
to you!
yo did you drive here, man?
ahh, please.
look, why... why don't you take... take my phone, okay?
call dad and bust me, why don't ya?
no, I'm just saying, you're wasted. You can't just drive...
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I heard ya.
what was that?
what? No. Trevor, let's just sit down, okay?
we'll... You... you don't hear that?
Trevor, there's nothing there. All right?
let's just sit down, and we'll all just...
what the...? You got to run. You got to run!
I'm sorry, but what is your brother on?
Trev, come on. Stop being a tool.
come on, trev. Let's head back.
dude.
ladies.
what do you want, Top Gun?
for starters, I'd like a little respect.
sorry, Officer. We didn't realize.
all's forgiven. Take a seat.
tell me about Trevor Mcann. Other night up at widow's peak.
okay. - All right.
it was weird 'cause he was super-drunk. - Well, it was just like he was super-drunk.
you. Go.
it was Jenny Greentree. - Shut up. Okay?
she's just a dumb legend. - Hold up. Who?
my dad says she really died in the woods.
and she's buried in the town cemetery.
all right, Jenny G. Your ganking days are over.
you've been Garthed.
ray, where are you?
you should be with your family right now.
don't do anything stupid. Please.
Yeah, I clocked out. Put it to bed. Problem solved.
and I'm headed your way, so, uh... Fire up that hot tub.
no, I heart you more.
abandoned vehicle out by Widow's Peak.
uh, we got another body up here. Guy's torn to shreds.
What?! No way. How is that possible? I Garthed her!
all right, well, call us if he wakes up or, you know, anything.
Yeah, fine. Thanks for your help, Meg.
what a bitch.
so, Cass is the same, then? - Yeah, down to the drool.
by the way, how is your custard?
it's all right. It's getting better.
just wish it wasn't like the damn tape from "The Ring.
I mean, I feel like I'm okay 'cause I passed on the crazy.
no, you didn't. You heard what Cass said.
let's... let's not. You know what?
hello. - Hey, Dean. It's Garth.
wait. W-who is this?
Garth. Garth Fitzgerald iv.
we worked together on that demon thing? You owe me one?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, how you doing, Garth?
I'm ready to cash in that chip, Bra.
there's something brewing in Junction City, Kansas.
well, this is it.
gentlemen... this is Corporal Brown.
corporal James brown. I'm shipping off to the A. F. maana.
I'm here to pay respects to my cousin as I will not be able to attend the funeral.
that must be terrible for your family.
losing two brothers so fast.
Yeah. Yeah. My aunt... she's, uh... she's real broken up about it.
Hey, Doc, can we see both files, please?
my wife. I'll, uh, be in my office.
great.
you didn't say they were brothers.
dude, I just found out about the other corpse, and... started moving quick.
I'm sucking up info as I go.
what, are you allergic to a suit?
no. I just... Look good in a uniform.
Yep. Same cause of death.
right, uh, gutted at night in the woods, where legend says that the ghost of Jenny Greentree roams.
Oh, uh, I already scanned for EM... F.
I guess mine must be broken again.
all right. I'm reading your mail.
uh, ghost of Jenny... whatever? - Greentree.
that's just it. I torched her bones.
Yeah, well, maybe she's got something still laying around.
highly doubtful. Chick was homeless.
Plus, is it me, or is this less evil spirit, more monster chow?
a werewolf?
except the witness said that whatever was chasing victim numero uno was invisible.
uh so, invisible ghost werewolf? - Why'd you think I called for backup?
either of you ever heard of Thighslapper Ale?
is that a stripper or a beverage?
beverage for douchebags.
uh, number one microbrew in the Pacific Northwest.
but we're in Kansas.
Yeah, I rest my case. What's your point?
the owner is the dad to the dead brothers.
right. I'll can the uniform, go Fed.
see you at the brewery in 40.
he grows on you.
agents. I'm Marie. I'm a manager.
thanks for coming in on a Sunday.
we want to help. Anything we can do.
so all this is your dad's, huh?
and his friend... Randy Baxter. They own the place together now.
now?
well, since Dale died.
hold on, hold on, hold on. You think I just come in late whenever I want?
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
the, uh,"charming" Randy Baxter.
tell you what... congratulations. You're headed for the graveyard shift.
be one second late, and you're fired.
Yes, sir.
he's actually a really nice guy.
it's just not easy being the axman.
so true.
my comrades got you covered, so if you'll excuse me.
uh, yeah, I'll go with you.
Mr. Mcann? Uh, we'll be brief. I promise.
Mr. Mcann, is there any reason to believe your sons may have had enemies?
we were told they were animal attacks.
we just need to explore every possibility.
they got lots of friends. No.
well, do they work here with you? Like Marie does.
could someone have been jealous?
n-no. Marie's the only one.
okay... no. Th--there's no...
Jim. It's okay. It's okay.
let him get some rest. I'll answer your questions.
of course.
he blamed himself when Dale died, and now this.
why did he blame himself?
well, Dale was sensitive. But what do you do... watch them 247?
you can't blame Dale's friends.
but your dad still feels bad.
and it doesn't help Dale's wife is suing us.
Really? Why?
she's angry and grieving, and this is America?
I knew Ray and Trevor.
hell, I'm godfather to all four of Jim's kids.
ray and Trevor loved their fun, but they'd never do anything crazy.
no rugrats of your own? - Just Jim's.
they'd borrow my car, raid my fridge.
now, the two of you started this company with a third partner. Right?
Yeah. Dale.
he passed away a few months ago.
passed away in the woods or...? - He took his own life.
sorry.
well, he had problems for a long time.
look, this is just a nightmare. First Dale, now this.
this was gonna be our big year.
we're selling Thighslapper to one of the largest distributors in the U. S.
it's been in the works for months.
news is gonna hit public pretty soon.
well, that's the brass ring, huh?
given other circumstances, yeah, we'd be celebrating right about now.
that looks great, sweetie. There's grandpa.
I'll get some snacks. You should eat.
sit, Dad.
Hey, what you drawing?
my world.
what is it, sweetie?
what is it?
there's a million things with claws go bump in the night.
once you throw in "invisible," the number goes down.
afternoon Delights? Really, Garth?
don't you think this place is a little, uh...
uh, you want a nice hot tub after a day at the office.
it's the little things.
I feel sad for those brewery dudes.
spend your life beautifying the world through beer.
first a partner offs himself.
now two kids get ganked by unknown freakadeek.
according to this, Dale wasn't just a partner. He was also the brewmaster.
Brewmaster? - He was widely considered a genius.
all right, that's it.
no microbrew is worth... What was it... eight Food Magazine awards?
beer's not food. It's... whatever water is.
Thighslapper.
wow, that's actually awesome.
damn it, I'm not even mad anymore.
party on, Garth.
I don't even usually drink beer.
it messes with my depth perception.
especially when I skinny-dip.
Hey, you guys want to hear a joke?
listen to this. This is something interesting.
Garth, are you drunk?
dude, I just... drank a whole beer. Of course I'm drunk.
something interesting. - Right.
Hey, can I have some more Thighslapper?
no. - No. Coffee for you, Tara Reid.
coffee with kalh a in it?
so, it says that Dale actually left the company two weeks before he died.
or... maybe he got pushed out 'cause he didn't want to sell.
I mean, Baxter said the deal's been in the works for months.
that would explain the widow. She's suing.
maybe Dale had a bone to pick, and he's still picking it.
right. So, maybe he's a spirito malo.
unit to Mcann residence. 698 Washburn.
Mcann residence, as in Jim Mcann?
as in, let's hope for their sake our spirito ain't made it out of the woods.
all right. Let's go check it.
uh, you two go. I'm gonna visit the widow.
so? - Place is clean.
my EMF is a nada. So is this one.
is that mine? - Yeah.
I borrowed it in case mine's broke.
so, uh... we still on invisible werewolf?
maybe, maybe not.
I can't get Tess to talk. But I get the feeling she saw something.
I'm gonna take a run at her.
a what? - Trust me. My special lady has twins.
Mr. Mcann? - Special lady.
do you mind if we speak to Tess alone for just a sec? It would really help.
honey, we'll... We'll be right out there, okay?
Thanks.
Hi, Tess.
you want to tell me what you saw tonight?
or maybe you'll talk to... Mr. Fizzles!
I'm your friend!
Garth. Why don't we put the sock away?
Mr. Fizzles wants to help Tess. He wants to listen.
Mr. Fizzles is gonna go where the sun don't shine.
it was a monster.
I believe you, Tess. Did it have claws?
how come you were the only one that could see it, Tess?
what else, Tess?
you sure?
cause Mr. Fizzles can sense when you're being a... liar.
all right. That's... that's enough... Mr. Fizzles.
I drank a grown-up drink.
uh, grown-up like, uh, coffee?
well, you mean alcohol?
it was an accident.
don't let them arrest me, Mr. Fizzles.
your husband did a lot of traveling, huh?
he went to all kinds of exotic places for the best ingredients.
right. I've tried his work. It's... it's great.
um, I hear you're not exactly on the best of terms with Dale's old partners.
well, they sold his company right out from under him.
it's not about money. It's about...
it was his baby, you know?
you sound pretty upset about it.
I'm furious. I hate them.
but then I think how Dale was.
what do you mean?
his friends left him behind, but you know what he said?
I'm gonna send them a gift that shows I forgive them.
do you have any idea what he sent them?
bottle of saki. From one of his trips.
in a... gorgeous box with writing.
he was so careful with it. Wouldn't let me touch it.
so, kid in the woods sees something that nobody else does.
then Tess sees a monster, and Jim doesn't. What's the thread?
well, certain mutants see infrared.
grown-up drinks.
Tess chugged her mom's, and vic number one was plastered.
right. So...
monster you got to be drunk to see.
cool!
also... hard to fight.
just getting in the zone. You are strictly on wine coolers.
Hey, I love those. Anything sweet.
so, uh, what's with the Grody flask anyway? Lucky charm?
it's Bobby's.
no microbrew is worth... what was it... eight...
Really?
cause, um...
you think there's a possibility that Bobby's riding your wave?
no, we gave him a hunter's wake.
Yeah, I-I burned my cousin Brandon, and he stayed stuck.
and... and... and they got ghosts in India, and they cremate everybody over there.
it's just instinct, but maybe there is EMF around here.
it just ain't the job.
all right, we're not gonna talk about this, okay? Not in the middle of work.
sorry.
just hope that fire did the trick.
Yeah. Got it. We're on our way.
here it is.
wait a second.
someone's been sampling the goods.
Oh, you don't say?
Hey, check it out.
God, I love paranoid people.
see if you can get on.
okay.
all right, so, first death was, what, four months ago? Yeah?
Mm-hmm, and, uh, Trevor Mcann. Patient zero.
so, what did he let out of that bottle?
nothing there.
that we can see.
what, are you kidding me? - Tick-tock.
I mean, can you even get drunk anymore?
it's kind of like drinking a vitamin for you, right?
shut up.
holy...
all right. Party time. Rewind and go.
so, he... he let that thing out of the box, and it must have just followed him to the place with all the thingies.
Yes. Yes. That's smart.
I'm actually kind of drunk.
what is this?
me likey.
I miss these talks.
what the hell?!
Oh, man. Turn it off. Turn it off.
FBI, huh? You know what? You can save it for the cops.
Mr. Baxter, listen. If you just let us explain, you...
911. What's your emergency?
Hello? Do you need assistance?
anata ga marou mono...
wa anata ka ra mo morau.
it says,"what you took will be taken from you.
like, eye for an eye.
you with me?
Kono bin niwa syoujou zuke no sake ga hu-in sarete iru.
Where'd you guys get this anyway?
Why? Is there, uh, something the matter?
well, you're not superstitious, are you?
not at all. - No, no.
because... this says the bottle inside contains a Shojo.
what's a... Shojo?
an alcohol spirit.
look, it's just an old myth. I wouldn't worry about it.
but they are not known for being friendly.
I got to go.
there you go. Thank you. - Thank you. Take care.
Where's Baxter?
dude's a lot heavier than he looks, F.Y. I.
but here. Thought you might want this back.
you have the C. E.O. of the douchiest microbrew in the U. S. gagged in your hot tub?
you really think that's gonna end well?
I'm not feeling the love.
all right. Shojo. Uh, let's see what we can see.
what's Shojo?
japanese booze monster.
I guess that would explain why you got to be drunk to see it.
very poetic.
creepy.
okay. So, a Shojo is said to roam where there's lots of alcohol.
there's lore saying that, back in the old day, if you were plastered enough, you could see one skulking around the breweries in Japan.
Yeah, but why is this one shredding brewers' kids?
apparently, you can harness the will of a Shojo with the right spell box.
then you basically have an attack dog that you can sic on whatever sort of personal revenge mission you want.
so Dale nabs one to punish his pals.
send the bottle, sooner or later it's popped open.
then you have a Shojo that will do whatever Dale compelled it to do right here on the box.
wait. Except it's not killing the people that screwed him over.
well, Dale's widow said the company was his baby.
so, if he really wanted his friends to feel what he felt...
he would take theirs. Well, their kids. Jim's, anyways.
and Baxter was the godfather.
all right, skip to how do we gank it.
good news. It is killable. - But...
but only with a samurai sword consecrated with a shinto blessing.
well... That's not a silver lining.
.the Shojo already cleaned house, right? I mean, Marie's the last target standing, so...I'll hit the pawn shops and, uh, look for the sword. You babysit Marie.
Yikes. Sorry.
don't worry about it.
unless I've got nothing to be sorry for.
Garth. - What's he talking about?
I'm concerned that Bobby might be haunting you.
I brought it up to Dean, and he shot me down.
Garth! Leave it alone.
it's okay. - No, it's far from okay.
I've already tried contacting Bobby.
when that beer disappeared, I pulled out a talking board.
without me?
you know, I figured, why drag you in...
when it's something I could just put to bed myself.
And?
and if he was there, I'd have told you.
talk about this later. You follow Marie.
let me borrow your keys.
I'm trying to help you, Mr. Baxter.
and who the hell are you?
now, I'm confused.
Dale goes to get you all where it hurts... the kids.
only, you don't have any kids.
it still affects me. Believe me.
.you want to tell me what you're hiding?
hiding?
tell me this.
when was the last time you gave an employee three chances?
probably never. - Exactly. You're the axman, right?
tough job, but, hey, somebody's got to.
so, how come you cut that slacker janitor so many breaks?
Yeah. Well, I googled.
come to find his mother... was your secretary way back in the day.
of course, you were married to Mrs. B.so, uh...
no way there's anything naughty there, right?
what do you need to get?
it don't matter what Dale knows about you, 'cause that thing out there killing the kids... it knows!
it didn't end well with his mom.
she made me swear never to tell him.
so much for that. Where is he?
he's, uh... he's at the brewery.
working the graveyard shift.
here.
if you care about that kid at all, don't call the cops on me just yet.
it says it's best to do this in a running spring.
uh, yeah. I, uh... I got it. Okay. We good?
I'll do my best. - All right.
Shichihukujin... Go.
hito no teni rori korekara seitoun yakuwari wo hatasu kono Ken wo tataer.
that's it.
all right. Uh, thanks. There.
thank you. - Yeah.
Hey, Garth.
Dean, Baxter's got a secret love child! The Shojo might come for him first!
whoa, slow down! - I'm trying to save lives here!
are you drunk?
damn it! Damn it.
Garth? You dropped the phone, didn't you?
sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm here.
where the hell are you? - I'm in the brewery.
Dean. It's here.
what the hell?!
come with me if you want to live!
Hey, you good to drive?
well, get a ride. It's at the brewery.
what?
there's another kid. Don't think... move.
wait! Wait, wait, wait! Taxi!
stop! Hold on, hold on. National security! Please!
thank you, ma'am. Sorry. Thanks, guys. Okay.
brewery. Step on it!
what? - The brewery!
Hurry! Hurry. Hurry, hurry. Please?
uh, yeah, but I like to drive safe, you know.
dude, what's going on? Who are you? - I'm the law, son. Now, follow me.
are you drunk, dude?! Get away from me!
all right. I'll just shoot.
Baxter is your father. Baxter screwed Dale.
Dale roped this Japanese monster you can only see when you're drunk, and now it's here to kill you.
whoa, wait a minute. Baxter is my father?
what are you looking at? - Damn it, run!
dude, there's nothing there!
Oh, God. Stay behind me. Stay behind me.
okay, okay, okay. What, you can see it?
Yeah. I'm skunked. Just...
fire exit. On three. All right? - Okay.
okay. So much for that.
get back!
where is it?! - S-swing right!
my right.
3: 00, Dean!
6: 00!
you okay? - I'm alive? Yeah.
Sam? - Yeah.
Where's Garth? - Well, he's... he's over this way.
could you go get him? - All right.
What'd I miss?
this moved.
are you here?
come on, do something.
you sure you guys don't want to hang out?
grab some brunch, maybe some brews?
tempting but, uh, we better roll.
all right, well...
Yeah.
call me anytime. - All right.
and you, Sam. - Yeah.
Aw, come here. - yeah. Thanks, Garth.
sayonara, kemo sabes!
nice ride.
you're right. He has grown on me.
all right. So, let's talk about it.
about what? The, uh, talking board?
that's fine. I get it, I guess.
no. Not that.
look, I heard you. - Heard me what?
what happened in the brewery, Dean?
nothing. It was, uh... it was just my imagination.
Dean... Look, I know something happened. I just want you to be straight with me.
the blade was across the room, and then it was in my hand.
and then my beer drank itself.
Oh, and then, that page magically appeared on the bed.
and... and then Bobby's book feel down, and out popped the number of the guy who found Cass.
nothing, I'm sure. - Clearly.
well, then, what, Sam? Is Bobby here or not?!
you know what I think, Dean?
I think that regular people, they see ones they lost everywhere, too.
Yeah. Freaking ghosts!
or they just miss them a lot.
I mean, they see a face in the crowd... we see a book falling off the table.
same thing, Dean. I mean, I did the talking board. I ran plenty of EMF.
when that beer went poof, I went a little nuts.
Yeah, and why didn't you tell me?
like I said, little nuts at the time.
all right, well, if it wasn't Bobby, then what Jedi'd that sword into my hand?
the Shojo slammed the door from across the room.
maybe it was trying to grab the sword, too.
right.
right, I mean, if it was Bobby, he would let us know.
I mean, who knows more about being a ghost than Bobby? Instant Swayze, right?
exactly.
okay.
okay, so your theory is that... that we're practically regular people about something for once.
all right.
well, you want to grab some brunch and some brews?
Ugh, no. I'm so hung over. Let's just hit the road.
all right.
hang on.
there you are.
I'm right here, you idjit!
balls!
I am inside you.
is it me, or is this just like the cage?
so, Dean, what's poor, dead Castiel doing in that junker out there?
he doesn't know he's Cass. - I know.
so, here's the deal... I need friends.
we go straight to Sam.
so, you're saying there's nothing? - This isn't a problem I can make disappear.
but I may be able to shift it.
I don't know. I mean, we can't just leave him.
well, we can't bring him with us.
everything on the planet's out for us, okay? This is safer.
welcome to the team, Nurse Masters.
so Dick's funding an archaeological dig?
outstanding. You will call as soon as the package is in hand.
I don't know. Whatever it is, he wants it bad, which means we got to grab it... end of story.
I've been looking for this for a very, very long time.
so now what? - That's a good question.
why don't we answer that a few thousand miles away from here, though?
Hey, Kevin.
princeton just adjusted its acceptance rate down to 8. 7% for 2013.
breathe, Kevin. Are you studying?
I'm talking to you.
I'll start on probability and statistics in 14 minutes.
I hate probability.
tomorrow's my last chance to get a perfect math score.
your S. A.T. s are great!
Channing, everybody's S. A.T. s are great. I have to do perfect.
who knows? The essays are at least as important.
I have absolutely nothing to say.
I know. I know what you mean.
I read one by a kid who got into Cornell.
he didn't have any arms or legs or anything.
he had to type the whole thing with his mouth.
it was beautiful.
I am so screwed.
you know, no matter what, one day, college isn't going to matter anymore.
you're out of your mind.
that's a lot of fuss over a caveman lego.
Yeah.
well, whatever Dick wants is bricked up inside that.
that sound like somebody saying, "no, wait...stop" to you?
Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, well.
I don't know.
I think the line might panic when they turn this corner, see the blade assembly up ahead.
strange, isn't it, that someone would choose to be named "Dick"?
yes?
this is Kevin Tran's voicemail. Please leave a message.
Kevin, it's mom. I know you're at school already, about to take the test.
and I know all your hard work will net the results we've discussed...
wait!
What?! - but like Dr. Ender said, don't obsess on the "perfect.
no. No. No!
that's just a nice feather in our cap, if we get it.
now, Kevin, we're about to finish up our last seminar.
my flight's confirmed for 7: 00, so I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow.
love you, honey.
at a lost to explain the continent-wide storm system that appeared seemingly out of nowhere, blanketing a good part of the nation in freak lightning displays.
here with Dr. Marlon Price of the U. S. Meteorological Society had a press conference earlier today.
Baffled"? No, I'm not baffled.
frankly, I'm offended.
this is not the way weather behaves.
Bobby, that you?
think so.
but that whole adventure at Roman's seems to have drained his batteries.
so, what?
we start the storm heard 'round the world?
when we broke this thing open last night, every maternity ward within a hundred-mile radius got slammed.
looks like any woman in the last month of her pregnancy went into labor.
this one goes out to all the ladies.
so, heavyweight signs, omens... what do we got?
I assume it's writing. I've never seen anything like it, ever.
and it doesn't match anything in any book or online.
all right, so big daddy chomper lands here, he grabs himself some dick...
and then he starts secretly underwriting university departments, pouring money into digs...
all for this.
Why?
no clue.
we do know that he will be tearing new ones until he gets it back, though.
look, we got to take a minute, hole up somewhere safe, find out what we've got.
Rufus' cabin, then? - Yeah.
this time, I'm doing the shopping.
it's Meg.
what? - What up, Bullwinkle?
just a little FYI call. Your boy's awake.
what? Cass is awake.
when? When? - Last night about 8: 00.
and you waited till now to call us?
I've been busy with Cass.
he's just a tad different than when he dozed off,'kay?
what do you mean, different?
Hey, Secrest, guess what... not a nurse.
just playing one on TV.
want answers? Start driving.
great. So, Indiana?
Yeah. 8: 00 last night.
Yeah. Same time we opened up that thing.
Kevin? Where were you today? You missed the test!
I... - And student council and quartet.
I had to take my mom's car.
I think I had a seizure or something.
I've been chosen. It's my birthright.
Oh, my God, Kevin, all the pressure you've been under.
this isn't one of those overachiever-teen meltdowns, is it?
I'm supposed to keep going. I'm not allowed to stop.
what do you mean,"not allowed"?
is someone with you?
they didn't make you take your mother's car, did they?
we raced all the way here.
now I don't know. I can't say I'm fired up to see what's left of the guy.
you think he remembers at all?
that, and I'm guessing whatever kind of hell baggage he lifted off of your plate.
it's not gonna be pretty.
excuse me, gentlemen, but it's way past visiting hours.
it's okay, Abel. I've been expecting them.
Hello, boys.
Hey, Cass.
Hello, Dean.
Hey, Castiel.
look at you, walkin' and talkin'. That's...
that's great, right?
pull my finger.
what? - My finger... pull it.
just hang on, Cass.
wait. Let us catch up to you for a second.
so, you're saying you remember who you are, what you are.
Yes. Of course.
outside today, in the garden, I followed a honeybee.
I saw the route of flowers.
it's all right there, the whole plan. There's nothing to add.
you might want to add a little thorazine.
right? He's been like the naked guy at the rave ever since he woke up. Totally useless.
will you look at her? My caretaker.
all of that thorny pain. So beautiful.
we've been over this. I don't like poetry. Put up or shut up.
okay. So, Cass, you said you woke up last night?
Yes. I heard a ping that pierced me, and, well, you wouldn't have heard it unless you were an Angel at the time.
that's also when we opened this.
of course. Now I understand.
understand what? - You're the ones.
well... I guess that makes sense. - What makes sense?
if someone was going to free the Word from the vault of the earth, it would end up being you two.
I love you guys.
all right. All right.
okay. Yeah, yeah. You said something about "The Word." Is that what's written on there?
did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?
I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.
Cass, please, we're losing ground out there, okay?
we need your help. Can you not see that?
this is the handwriting of Metatron.
Metatron? You saying a Transformer wrote that?
no. That's Megatron. - What?!
the Transformer...it's Megatron. - What?
Metatron.
he's an Angel. He's the scribe of God.
he took down dictation when creation was being formed.
and that's the word of God? - One of them, yes.
well, what's it say, then?
Tree"?
horse"? "Fiddler crab"? I can't read it. It wasn't meant for angels.
okay, this all sounds bad.
what are you two jackasses doing with the word of God?
let me see that thing. - Back off, Meg.
come on, it's my ass, too. - Back off.
damn it! Enough of this "demons are second-class citizens" crap!
don't like conflict.
what the hell was that? - You heard him. He doesn't like conflict.
he's down in the dayroom now. I guarantee it.
all right, I'll go handle Cass. Sam, will you please pick up the word of God?
Yeah.
what are you guys caught up in now?
I deserve to know, Sam.
okay, fine.
I'll hit the road, then. Let me just go get my angel.
Meg, what are you talking about? Stop.
we both call, who do you think Cass will come to? I'm guessing me.
you heard him... thorny beauty, blah, blah.
I'm the Saint who stayed with him.
he owes me. His words.
Yeah, what about what he owes us?
well, work on him a little. Maybe he'll start crushing on you, too, hot stuff.
what are you gonna do with a broken angel? Don't be stupid.
I'll take power where I can get it. I've got myself to look out for.
what the hell?
not a demon or a chomper. What the hell are you?
I'm a... K-Kevin Tran.
I'm in advanced placement. P-p-p-p-please don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.
I... I don't... I don't know why, but I can't let go of this.
you realize you just broke God's word?
it's Sam's thing, isn't it?
you taking on his, uh, cage-match scars.
I'm guessing that's what broke your bank, right?
well, it took... everything to get me here.
what are you talking about, man?
Dean, I know you want different answers.
no, I want you to button up your coat and help us take down Leviathans.
do you remember what you did?
do you want to go first?
you really stepped in it, kid. Oh, man.
all I know is, this is... it's for me.
I'm supposed to keep it. - Good luck.
but you don't know what it is?
open it.
you know, we weren't sure at first which monkeys were gonna make it.
no offense, but I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was...just amazing.
it's in perfect tune with the spheres.
but in the end, it was you... the homo sapiens sapiens.
you guys ate the apple, invented pants.
Cass, where do we find this, uh, Metatron? Is he still alive?
I'm sorry. I... I think you have to go back to start.
this is important.
I think Metatron could stop a lot of bad. You understand that?
we live in a "sorry" universe.
it's engineered to create conflict.
I mean, why should I prosper from... your misfortune?
but these are the rules. I didn't make them.
you made some of them.
when you tried to become God, when you cut that hole into that wall.
it's your move.
forget the damn game!
forget the game, Cass.
I'm sorry, Dean.
no.
you're playing "Sorry
it's writing. - Yeah. Yeah, we get that.
what's Leviathan?
what? You can read it? Is that what it says?
sort of. It hurts a little.
like looking through somebody else's glasses, but I think it...
it's about Leviathan, how it came to be.
God locked him up far away, right? Like in jail...
because they're so... they're...
they're real, aren't they?
Yeah, Kevin. They... they are. And they're here.
does it say anything about how to kill them?
cause that's... that's kind of been a problem.
I don't know. It's not like reading reading.
it... it's hard to focus on it too long.
Sam. Something's up. - What?
Kevin, hey, hey, hey. Kevin.
demon.
what? - Sam.
he's talking to angels.
a demon whore and a Winchester... again.
step away from the Prophet!
who? Who, me?
sole keeper of the word on earth, we are here to take you.
what do you mean,"take"?
kill the demon and her lover.
that's not how it... we're not...
where did you get that?!
you're alive?
you.
Hello, Hester.
you smote thousands in Heaven.
you gave a big, scary speech. Then you were gone.
what the hell was that?!
rude, for one thing.
where have you been?
Oh, Inias. Hester, I...
I know you want something... answers.
I... I wish it could be that...
there are still many things I can teach you.
I can offer, um, well, perspective.
here. Pull my finger.
meg will... will get another light, and I'll... I'll blow it out again.
and, well, this time, it'll be funny, and we'll all look back and laugh.
you're insane.
heads up, Sunshine.
all angels blown back to their corners. We got like three, four hours tops.
Meg, where did you get that?
a lot of angels died this year.
what's happening?!
what's happening?!
what is that?
it's, uh... Kevin Tran.
he's, uh, in advanced placement.
so, these Leviathans... these monsters are real.
and angels with wings? - No.
no wings. No anything.
no junk. Junkless.
so, Kevin, you can, uh, read the chicken scratch on the God rock, huh?
that is back in one piece, I see.
and you're saying that there's some sort of a "How to punch Dick" recipe in there somewhere?
I don't know what you're saying, but it seems kind of like an "in case of emergency" note.
what did they mean by "Prophet"?
Oh, no. Really? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what the angel said.
I don't want to be a Prophet.
no. You don't at all.
gentlemen, we've got to start running and hiding.
or do you want to tangle with those wing nuts twice?
I'm sorry. Did you say "we"?
I'm on the angels' radar now.
you think I don't need a little safety in numbers?
all right, we'll go to Rufus' cabin.
we know you're hungry.
why not enjoy Biggerson's homemade pie bar?
it's like a salad bar but with pie.
now back to our top story on news 10, the search for the missing honor student.
the victim in this case reportedly insisted he'd been chosen by birthright, causing speculation that a cult may be behind the abduction.
the family car is also missing.
federal authorities have been placed on alert.
again, 16-year-old honor student Kevin Tran reportedly taken from his Michigan home early yesterday.
Oh, crap.
so, we got another wrinkle.
uh, looks like Kevin's gone missing...
and it's gone federal.
Yeah.
Where's Meg? - I'm here.
great, so now we're kidnappers?
not if we shut up about it.
Why? Who'd we kidnap?
Oh, God. - What?
nothing. Nothing. Just...
my life... my future...
my girlfriend... My mom's car.
Yeah. Yeah, Castiel. It's me.
Cass? Where? Where is he?
shut up. No. No, Cass. You talk.
Perth? - "Perth"? As in Australia?
what dogs? He says he's surrounded by unhappy dogs.
okay.
he's at a dog track in Perth.
Yeah, they're unhappy 'cause the rabbit's fake.
listen, we're on highway 94, north of St. Cloud, Minnesota, just passing mile marker 79.
Kevin, this is Castiel.
you're one of the angels?
boop.
Meg, are you hurt? - Shut up.
guys, what happened back there? Who were those guys?
they're from the Garrison... my old Garrison.
looks like Hester's taken over.
we were assigned to watch the earth.
often, it was boring.
the wars were very boring and the sex... you know, the repetition.
anyway, I was, uh... I was their Captain.
isn't that strange?
Cass, why are they pissed at us now?
you know, those racing dogs were absolutely miserable. They can only think in ovals.
Cass, don't make me pull this car over! Why are angels after us?
are you angry? Why are you angry?
no, I-I'm...
please, can we just stay on target?
there is no reason for anger. They're only following protocol.
if the word of God is revealed, a keeper of the word will awaken, like this hot potato right here.
please stop that.
anyway, Garrison code dictates you take the keeper to the desert to learn the word away from men.
what kind of sense does that make? He has to tell us so that we can use it.
that's God and his shiny red apples.
I can't live in the desert. I-I'm applying to Princeton!
okay, you know what? Screw the Garrison.
we need the tablet to end Dick Roman's "soylent us" crap.
if you want the word, you'll have to duck Hester and her soldiers.
Yeah, you're in our corner, right, Cass?
no, I don't fight anymore.
I watch the bees.
let's leave off angel-proofing sigils or I'll be expelled, too.
as long as we're invisible to your Garrison buddies, it works for me.
I'm sure you're pretty hungry, so once we get settled in upstairs, we'll get some dinner going.
this looks like a sex-torture dungeon.
is this a sex-torture dungeon?
no, this is not a sex-torture...
get over here. Sit down and read, would you?
you seem troubled.
of course, that's a primary aspect of your personality, so I sometimes ignore it.
okay.
right now I'm just wondering about you.
what about me?
you're worried about the burden I lifted from you.
I think I was done for.
do you see Lucifer?
I did at first. It was...
it was a projection of yours, I think, sort of an aftertaste.
now I more see...
well, everything.
it's funny. I was... I was done for, too.
the weight of all my mistakes, all those lives and souls lost, I...
I couldn't take it, either.
I was...I was lost until I took on your pain.
it's strange to think that that helped, but...
I know you never did anything but try to help.
I realize that, Cass, and I'm grateful.
we're all grateful.
and we're gonna help you get better, okay? No matter what it takes.
what do you mean,"better"?
this is all too much.
what's happened to my life?
I'm just a kid from Michigan. I didn't want to be a word keeper!
looks like we're brown-baggin' it.
I am not prepared to factor the supernatural into my world view.
okay, there we go.
that's it. That's it. Just breathe. Take it easy.
I don't know, man. What can I say?
you've been chosen.
and it sucks.
believe me.
there's no use asking "why me?
cause the angels... they don't care.
I think maybe they just don't have the equipment to care.
seems like when they try, it just...
breaks them apart.
I just want to be the first Asian-American President of the United States.
then do your homework.
see? I'm here, just like I said.
you'd better start talking, skank.
tell me again why I'm not just hauling you off to the king's cash window.
come on, Rosco. I told you. I've got something way better.
you know how Crowley likes presents.
he's not gonna care if we bring in the Winchesters.
yesterday's news.
not the Winchesters.
I've got the angel who double-crossed him.
I've got Castiel.
Castiel... he's dead.
right,'cause you're in that loop.
where is he, then?
first, I want to know how many of you jerks I have to cut in.
you think we're stupid? We didn't tell anybody.
I love demons.
didn't expect to see you back.
Yeah, not without the King's army.
knife.
typical.
I save our bacon, and you're sitting here, waiting by a devil's trap.
seriously, I just killed two of Crowley's men.
I could have gone the other way on that.
it's true, incidentally.
there's other demons' blood on that blade.
look, I'm simpler than you think.
I've figured one thing out about this world... just one, pretty much.
you find a cause, and you serve it.
give yourself over, and it orders your life.
Lucifer and Yellow Eyes... their mission was it for me.
so, what? We should trust you because you wanted to free Satan from hell?
I'm talking "cause," douche bag, as in reason to get up in the morning.
obviously, these things shift over time.
we learn, we grow.
now, for me currently, the cause is bringing down the King.
and I know we'll need help to do it.
Crowley ain't the problem this year.
when are you gonna get it? Crowley's always the problem.
he's just waiting for the right moment to strike.
I know what I'm supposed to do.
and it isn't screw with Sam and Dean or lose the only angel who'd go to bat for me.
this is good... harmony, communication.
now our only problem is Hester. - What?
well, here, we're hidden from the Garrison, but when you killed a demon, you put out a pretty clear beacon.
we need better angel-proofing now.
you took the Prophet from us?!
I'm... I'm sorry?
you have fallen in every way imaginable.
please, Castiel. We have to follow the code. Help us do our work.
he can't help you. He can't help anybody.
we don't need his help... or his permission.
the Keeper goes to the desert tonight.
back off.
we're actually trying to clean up one of your Angel's messes!
you know that.
he's right. An angel brought the Leviathan back into this world, and... and they begged him.
they begged him not to do it.
look, just give us some time, okay? We will take care of your Prophet.
why should we give you anything...
after everything you have taken from us?
the very touch of you corrupts.
when Castiel first laid a hand on you in hell, he was lost!
for that, you're going to pay.
please. They're the ones we were put here to protect.
no, Castiel.
no more madness! No more promises! No more new Gods!
Hester! No! Please!
there's so few of us left.
you wanted free will.
now I'm making the choices.
what? Someone had to.
these are strange times.
I think they've always been.
I wish you'd come with us.
Oh, I'm not part of the Garrison anymore, Inias. I'm sorry.
Thanks, Kevin.
not a lot of people could handle this.
you doing all right there,"chosen one"?
Yeah.
are you ready, Kevin Tran?
bring the Keeper to his home.
we can watch over him there.
I couldn't find Meg anywhere.
Yes, well, she enjoys laying low.
here.
it says we need to start with the blood of a fallen angel.
well, you know me.
I'm always happy to bleed for the Winchesters.
what are you gonna do, Cass?
I don't know.
isn't that amazing?
well, let's get to work.
we're going everything we can. Mrs. Tran, believe me.
he said he'd had a s-seizure.
what... what if they hit him?
what if he has a brain injury?
you need to trust us, okay?
it won't help to wear yourself out with worry.
mom? - Kevin!
who are you? - It's... it's okay, Mom.
they brought me back. They're keeping me safe.
I don't believe that's true.
rock beats scissor.
Leviathan beats Angel.
Hello,Kevin.
I am inside you.
is it me, or is this just like the cage?
so, Dean, what's poor, dead Castiel doing in that junker out there?
he doesn't know he's Cass. - I know.
so, here's the deal... I need friends.
we go straight to Sam.
so, you're saying there's nothing? - This isn't a problem I can make disappear.
but I may be able to shift it.
I don't know. I mean, we can't just leave him.
well, we can't bring him with us.
everything on the planet's out for us, okay? This is safer.
welcome to the team, Nurse Masters.
so Dick's funding an archaeological dig?
outstanding. You will call as soon as the package is in hand.
I don't know. Whatever it is, he wants it bad, which means we got to grab it... end of story.
I've been looking for this for a very, very long time.
so now what? - That's a good question.
why don't we answer that a few thousand miles away from here, though?
Hey, Kevin.
princeton just adjusted its acceptance rate down to 8. 7% for 2013.
breathe, Kevin. Are you studying?
I'm talking to you.
I'll start on probability and statistics in 14 minutes.
I hate probability.
tomorrow's my last chance to get a perfect math score.
your S. A.T. s are great!
Channing, everybody's S. A.T. s are great. I have to do perfect.
who knows? The essays are at least as important.
I have absolutely nothing to say.
I know. I know what you mean.
I read one by a kid who got into Cornell.
he didn't have any arms or legs or anything.
he had to type the whole thing with his mouth.
it was beautiful.
I am so screwed.
you know, no matter what, one day, college isn't going to matter anymore.
you're out of your mind.
that's a lot of fuss over a caveman lego.
Yeah.
well, whatever Dick wants is bricked up inside that.
that sound like somebody saying, "no, wait...stop" to you?
Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.
Oh, well.
I don't know.
I think the line might panic when they turn this corner, see the blade assembly up ahead.
strange, isn't it, that someone would choose to be named "Dick"?
yes?
this is Kevin Tran's voicemail. Please leave a message.
Kevin, it's mom. I know you're at school already, about to take the test.
and I know all your hard work will net the results we've discussed...
wait!
What?! - but like Dr. Ender said, don't obsess on the "perfect.
no. No. No!
that's just a nice feather in our cap, if we get it.
now, Kevin, we're about to finish up our last seminar.
my flight's confirmed for 7: 00, so I'll see you at breakfast tomorrow.
love you, honey.
at a lost to explain the continent-wide storm system that appeared seemingly out of nowhere, blanketing a good part of the nation in freak lightning displays.
here with Dr. Marlon Price of the U. S. Meteorological Society had a press conference earlier today.
Baffled"? No, I'm not baffled.
frankly, I'm offended.
this is not the way weather behaves.
Bobby, that you?
think so.
but that whole adventure at Roman's seems to have drained his batteries.
so, what?
we start the storm heard 'round the world?
when we broke this thing open last night, every maternity ward within a hundred-mile radius got slammed.
looks like any woman in the last month of her pregnancy went into labor.
this one goes out to all the ladies.
so, heavyweight signs, omens... what do we got?
I assume it's writing. I've never seen anything like it, ever.
and it doesn't match anything in any book or online.
all right, so big daddy chomper lands here, he grabs himself some dick...
and then he starts secretly underwriting university departments, pouring money into digs...
all for this.
Why?
no clue.
we do know that he will be tearing new ones until he gets it back, though.
look, we got to take a minute, hole up somewhere safe, find out what we've got.
Rufus' cabin, then? - Yeah.
this time, I'm doing the shopping.
it's Meg.
what? - What up, Bullwinkle?
just a little FYI call. Your boy's awake.
what? Cass is awake.
when? When? - Last night about 8: 00.
and you waited till now to call us?
I've been busy with Cass.
he's just a tad different than when he dozed off,'kay?
what do you mean, different?
Hey, Secrest, guess what... not a nurse.
just playing one on TV.
want answers? Start driving.
great. So, Indiana?
Yeah. 8: 00 last night.
Yeah. Same time we opened up that thing.
Kevin? Where were you today? You missed the test!
I... - And student council and quartet.
I had to take my mom's car.
I think I had a seizure or something.
I've been chosen. It's my birthright.
Oh, my God, Kevin, all the pressure you've been under.
this isn't one of those overachiever-teen meltdowns, is it?
I'm supposed to keep going. I'm not allowed to stop.
what do you mean,"not allowed"?
is someone with you?
they didn't make you take your mother's car, did they?
we raced all the way here.
now I don't know. I can't say I'm fired up to see what's left of the guy.
you think he remembers at all?
that, and I'm guessing whatever kind of hell baggage he lifted off of your plate.
it's not gonna be pretty.
excuse me, gentlemen, but it's way past visiting hours.
it's okay, Abel. I've been expecting them.
Hello, boys.
Hey, Cass.
Hello, Dean.
Hey, Castiel.
look at you, walkin' and talkin'. That's...
that's great, right?
pull my finger.
what? - My finger... pull it.
just hang on, Cass.
wait. Let us catch up to you for a second.
so, you're saying you remember who you are, what you are.
Yes. Of course.
outside today, in the garden, I followed a honeybee.
I saw the route of flowers.
it's all right there, the whole plan. There's nothing to add.
you might want to add a little thorazine.
right? He's been like the naked guy at the rave ever since he woke up. Totally useless.
will you look at her? My caretaker.
all of that thorny pain. So beautiful.
we've been over this. I don't like poetry. Put up or shut up.
okay. So, Cass, you said you woke up last night?
Yes. I heard a ping that pierced me, and, well, you wouldn't have heard it unless you were an Angel at the time.
that's also when we opened this.
of course. Now I understand.
understand what? - You're the ones.
well... I guess that makes sense. - What makes sense?
if someone was going to free the Word from the vault of the earth, it would end up being you two.
I love you guys.
all right. All right.
okay. Yeah, yeah. You said something about "The Word." Is that what's written on there?
did you know that a cat's penis is sharply barbed along its shaft?
I know for a fact the females were not consulted about that.
Cass, please, we're losing ground out there, okay?
we need your help. Can you not see that?
this is the handwriting of Metatron.
Metatron? You saying a Transformer wrote that?
no. That's Megatron. - What?!
the Transformer...it's Megatron. - What?
Metatron.
he's an Angel. He's the scribe of God.
he took down dictation when creation was being formed.
and that's the word of God? - One of them, yes.
well, what's it say, then?
Tree"?
horse"? "Fiddler crab"? I can't read it. It wasn't meant for angels.
okay, this all sounds bad.
what are you two jackasses doing with the word of God?
let me see that thing. - Back off, Meg.
come on, it's my ass, too. - Back off.
damn it! Enough of this "demons are second-class citizens" crap!
don't like conflict.
what the hell was that? - You heard him. He doesn't like conflict.
he's down in the dayroom now. I guarantee it.
all right, I'll go handle Cass. Sam, will you please pick up the word of God?
Yeah.
what are you guys caught up in now?
I deserve to know, Sam.
okay, fine.
I'll hit the road, then. Let me just go get my angel.
Meg, what are you talking about? Stop.
we both call, who do you think Cass will come to? I'm guessing me.
you heard him... thorny beauty, blah, blah.
I'm the Saint who stayed with him.
he owes me. His words.
Yeah, what about what he owes us?
well, work on him a little. Maybe he'll start crushing on you, too, hot stuff.
what are you gonna do with a broken angel? Don't be stupid.
I'll take power where I can get it. I've got myself to look out for.
what the hell?
not a demon or a chomper. What the hell are you?
I'm a... K-Kevin Tran.
I'm in advanced placement. P-p-p-p-please don't kill me.
I'm not gonna kill you.
I... I don't... I don't know why, but I can't let go of this.
you realize you just broke God's word?
it's Sam's thing, isn't it?
you taking on his, uh, cage-match scars.
I'm guessing that's what broke your bank, right?
well, it took... everything to get me here.
what are you talking about, man?
Dean, I know you want different answers.
no, I want you to button up your coat and help us take down Leviathans.
do you remember what you did?
do you want to go first?
you really stepped in it, kid. Oh, man.
all I know is, this is... it's for me.
I'm supposed to keep it. - Good luck.
but you don't know what it is?
open it.
you know, we weren't sure at first which monkeys were gonna make it.
no offense, but I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was...just amazing.
it's in perfect tune with the spheres.
but in the end, it was you... the homo sapiens sapiens.
you guys ate the apple, invented pants.
Cass, where do we find this, uh, Metatron? Is he still alive?
I'm sorry. I... I think you have to go back to start.
this is important.
I think Metatron could stop a lot of bad. You understand that?
we live in a "sorry" universe.
it's engineered to create conflict.
I mean, why should I prosper from... your misfortune?
but these are the rules. I didn't make them.
you made some of them.
when you tried to become God, when you cut that hole into that wall.
it's your move.
forget the damn game!
forget the game, Cass.
I'm sorry, Dean.
no.
you're playing "Sorry
it's writing. - Yeah. Yeah, we get that.
what's Leviathan?
what? You can read it? Is that what it says?
sort of. It hurts a little.
like looking through somebody else's glasses, but I think it...
it's about Leviathan, how it came to be.
God locked him up far away, right? Like in jail...
because they're so... they're...
they're real, aren't they?
Yeah, Kevin. They... they are. And they're here.
does it say anything about how to kill them?
cause that's... that's kind of been a problem.
I don't know. It's not like reading reading.
it... it's hard to focus on it too long.
Sam. Something's up. - What?
Kevin, hey, hey, hey. Kevin.
demon.
what? - Sam.
he's talking to angels.
a demon whore and a Winchester... again.
step away from the Prophet!
who? Who, me?
sole keeper of the word on earth, we are here to take you.
what do you mean,"take"?
kill the demon and her lover.
that's not how it... we're not...
where did you get that?!
you're alive?
you.
Hello, Hester.
you smote thousands in Heaven.
you gave a big, scary speech. Then you were gone.
what the hell was that?!
rude, for one thing.
where have you been?
Oh, Inias. Hester, I...
I know you want something... answers.

meg will... will get another light, and I'll... I'll blow it out again.
and, well, this time, it'll be funny, and we'll all look back and laugh.
you're insane.
heads up, Sunshine.
all angels blown back to their corners. We got like three, four hours tops.
Meg, where did you get that?
a lot of angels died this year.
what's happening?!
what's happening?!
what is that?
it's, uh... Kevin Tran.
he's, uh, in advanced placement.
so, these Leviathans... these monsters are real.
and angels with wings? - No.
no wings. No anything.
no junk. Junkless.
so, Kevin, you can, uh, read the chicken scratch on the God rock, huh?
that is back in one piece, I see.
and you're saying that there's some sort of a "How to punch Dick" recipe in there somewhere?
I don't know what you're saying, but it seems kind of like an "in case of emergency" note.
what did they mean by "Prophet"?
Oh, no. Really? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what the angel said.
I don't want to be a Prophet.
no. You don't at all.
gentlemen, we've got to start running and hiding.
or do you want to tangle with those wing nuts twice?
I'm sorry. Did you say "we"?
I'm on the angels' radar now.
you think I don't need a little safety in numbers?
all right, we'll go to Rufus' cabin.
we know you're hungry.
why not enjoy Biggerson's homemade pie bar?
it's like a salad bar but with pie.
now back to our top story on news 10, the search for the missing honor student.
the victim in this case reportedly insisted he'd been chosen by birthright, causing speculation that a cult may be behind the abduction.
the family car is also missing.
federal authorities have been placed on alert.
again, 16-year-old honor student Kevin Tran reportedly taken from his Michigan home early yesterday.
Oh, crap.
so, we got another wrinkle.
uh, looks like Kevin's gone missing...
and it's gone federal.
Yeah.
Where's Meg? - I'm here.
great, so now we're kidnappers?
not if we shut up about it.
Why? Who'd we kidnap?
Oh, God. - What?
nothing. Nothing. Just...
my life... my future...
my girlfriend... My mom's car.
Yeah. Yeah, Castiel. It's me.
Cass? Where? Where is he?
shut up. No. No, Cass. You talk.
Perth? - "Perth"? As in Australia?
what dogs? He says he's surrounded by unhappy dogs.
okay.
he's at a dog track in Perth.
Yeah, they're unhappy 'cause the rabbit's fake.
listen, we're on highway 94, north of St. Cloud, Minnesota, just passing mile marker 79.
Kevin, this is Castiel.
you're one of the angels?
boop.
Meg, are you hurt? - Shut up.
guys, what happened back there? Who were those guys?
they're from the Garrison... my old Garrison.
looks like Hester's taken over.
we were assigned to watch the earth.
often, it was boring.
the wars were very boring and the sex... you know, the repetition.
anyway, I was, uh... I was their Captain.
isn't that strange?
Cass, why are they pissed at us now?
you know, those racing dogs were absolutely miserable. They can only think in ovals.
Cass, don't make me pull this car over! Why are angels after us?
are you angry? Why are you angry?
no, I-I'm...
please, can we just stay on target?
there is no reason for anger. They're only following protocol.
if the word of God is revealed, a keeper of the word will awaken, like this hot potato right here.
please stop that.
anyway, Garrison code dictates you take the keeper to the desert to learn the word away from men.
what kind of sense does that make? He has to tell us so that we can use it.
that's God and his shiny red apples.
I can't live in the desert. I-I'm applying to Princeton!
okay, you know what? Screw the Garrison.
we need the tablet to end Dick Roman's "soylent us" crap.
if you want the word, you'll have to duck Hester and her soldiers.
Yeah, you're in our corner, right, Cass?
no, I don't fight anymore.
I watch the bees.
let's leave off angel-proofing sigils or I'll be expelled, too.
as long as we're invisible to your Garrison buddies, it works for me.
I'm sure you're pretty hungry, so once we get settled in upstairs, we'll get some dinner going.
this looks like a sex-torture dungeon.
is this a sex-torture dungeon?
no, this is not a sex-torture...
get over here. Sit down and read, would you?
you seem troubled.
of course, that's a primary aspect of your personality, so I sometimes ignore it.
okay.
right now I'm just wondering about you.
what about me?
you're worried about the burden I lifted from you.
I think I was done for.
do you see Lucifer?
I did at first. It was...
it was a projection of yours, I think, sort of an aftertaste.
now I more see...
well, everything.
it's funny. I was... I was done for, too.
the weight of all my mistakes, all those lives and souls lost, I...
I couldn't take it, either.
I was...I was lost until I took on your pain.
it's strange to think that that helped, but...
I know you never did anything but try to help.
I realize that, Cass, and I'm grateful.
we're all grateful.
and we're gonna help you get better, okay? No matter what it takes.
what do you mean,"better"?
this is all too much.
what's happened to my life?
I'm just a kid from Michigan. I didn't want to be a word keeper!
looks like we're brown-baggin' it.
I am not prepared to factor the supernatural into my world view.
okay, there we go.
that's it. That's it. Just breathe. Take it easy.
I don't know, man. What can I say?
you've been chosen.
and it sucks.
believe me.
there's no use asking "why me?
cause the angels... they don't care.
I think maybe they just don't have the equipment to care.
seems like when they try, it just...
breaks them apart.
I just want to be the first Asian-American President of the United States.
then do your homework.
see? I'm here, just like I said.
you'd better start talking, skank.
tell me again why I'm not just hauling you off to the king's cash window.
come on, Rosco. I told you. I've got something way better.
you know how Crowley likes presents.
he's not gonna care if we bring in the Winchesters.
yesterday's news.
not the Winchesters.
I've got the angel who double-crossed him.
I've got Castiel.
Castiel... he's dead.
right,'cause you're in that loop.
where is he, then?
first, I want to know how many of you jerks I have to cut in.
you think we're stupid? We didn't tell anybody.
I love demons.
didn't expect to see you back.
Yeah, not without the King's army.
knife.
typical.
I save our bacon, and you're sitting here, waiting by a devil's trap.
seriously, I just killed two of Crowley's men.
I could have gone the other way on that.
it's true, incidentally.
there's other demons' blood on that blade.
look, I'm simpler than you think.
I've figured one thing out about this world... just one, pretty much.
you find a cause, and you serve it.
give yourself over, and it orders your life.
Lucifer and Yellow Eyes... their mission was it for me.
so, what? We should trust you because you wanted to free Satan from hell?
I'm talking "cause," douche bag, as in reason to get up in the morning.
obviously, these things shift over time.
we learn, we grow.
now, for me currently, the cause is bringing down the King.
and I know we'll need help to do it.
Crowley ain't the problem this year.
when are you gonna get it? Crowley's always the problem.
he's just waiting for the right moment to strike.
I know what I'm supposed to do.
and it isn't screw with Sam and Dean or lose the only angel who'd go to bat for me.
this is good... harmony, communication.
now our only problem is Hester. - What?
well, here, we're hidden from the Garrison, but when you killed a demon, you put out a pretty clear beacon.
we need better angel-proofing now.
you took the Prophet from us?!
I'm... I'm sorry?
you have fallen in every way imaginable.
please, Castiel. We have to follow the code. Help us do our work.
he can't help you. He can't help anybody.
we don't need his help... or his permission.
the Keeper goes to the desert tonight.
back off.
we're actually trying to clean up one of your Angel's messes!
you know that.
he's right. An angel brought the Leviathan back into this world, and... and they begged him.
they begged him not to do it.
look, just give us some time, okay? We will take care of your Prophet.
why should we give you anything...
after everything you have taken from us?
the very touch of you corrupts.
when Castiel first laid a hand on you in hell, he was lost!
for that, you're going to pay.
please. They're the ones we were put here to protect.
no, Castiel.
no more madness! No more promises! No more new Gods!
Hester! No! Please!
there's so few of us left.
you wanted free will.
now I'm making the choices.
what? Someone had to.
these are strange times.
I think they've always been.
I wish you'd come with us.
Oh, I'm not part of the Garrison anymore, Inias. I'm sorry.
Thanks, Kevin.
not a lot of people could handle this.
you doing all right there,"chosen one"?
Yeah.
are you ready, Kevin Tran?
bring the Keeper to his home.
we can watch over him there.
I couldn't find Meg anywhere.
Yes, well, she enjoys laying low.
here.
it says we need to start with the blood of a fallen angel.
well, you know me.
I'm always happy to bleed for the Winchesters.
what are you gonna do, Cass?
I don't know.
isn't that amazing?
well, let's get to work.
we're going everything we can. Mrs. Tran, believe me.
he said he'd had a s-seizure.
what... what if they hit him?
what if he has a brain injury?
you need to trust us, okay?
it won't help to wear yourself out with worry.
mom? - Kevin!
who are you? - It's... it's okay, Mom.
they brought me back. They're keeping me safe.
I don't believe that's true.
rock beats scissor.
Leviathan beats Angel.
Hello, Kevin.
we think it may have been an Alpha.
an Alpha, like...? - Like all monsters come from somewhere.
bag me a live Alpha.
the first of your species. - The very first.
prison full of monsters... can't just leave them, can't let them go.
I understand.
Geothrive is part of Roman Enterprises.
Dick's funding an archaeological dig...
factory in Saudi Arabia... - Fishery in Jakarta...
a research center... it's everywhere.
it's all tied together, Dean.
he's not in control. That was vengeful-spirit crap.
but it's still Bobby.
well, what the hell are you? - I'm a... K-Kevin Tran.
I'm in advanced placement.
he's a Prophet of the Lord.
and that's the word of God? - One of them, yes.
well, what's it say, then? - It's about Leviathan.
does it say anything about how to kill them?
Leviathan cannot be slain but by a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen.
it says we need to start with the blood of a fallen angel.
always happy to bleed for the Winchesters.
Hello, Kevin.
Thanks, Phil.
and now we turn our attention to agriculture, where an unlikely personality has now come on to the scene in a major way.
richard Roman, a C. E.O. whose company dominates the defense and aviation sectors, not to mention being a giant in the motivational-speaking world.
what can I say, Gloria? I'm a multitasker.
clearly.
and now you've recently purchased controlling stock in Sucrocorp...
among the world's leading manufacturers in high-fructose corn syrup.
it's a pleasure to have you with us, Richard.
please. "Dick.
so, tell us, Dick, why the recent fascination with big foods?
well, it's no secret we all love to eat, but now Sucrocorp will focus on eating well.
help me connect the dots.
how will pumping sweeteners into our system make us healthier?
one word... purity.
we're dialing back the additives to deliver the highest quality all-American product you people deserve.
america is for go-getters, folks who get off their butts and make it happen.
and we need you just as healthy as you can be.
which is why we are diving whole hog into what keeps Americans living longer...
and tasting better.
you do, of course, mean to say the food will be tasting better.
that's exactly what I mean.
your 11: 00 a. m.is waiting in the conference room.
thank you, Susan.
are we still looking for a rep in Mainstream Media?
Yes, we are.
Wunderbar. Put a "replace order" on Gloria there.
and with the corpse? - Call Chef Fieri.
I feel like barbecue.
Kevin. Dick.
I'm very excited to meet you.
you nervous? Don't be.
I'm your biggest fan.
I brought you a present.
what's that say, Kev?
I don't know.
cute.
easy, Edgar. Don't scare the boy.
you know, I've checked, Kevin.
number one in your class, winner of the Chad Kennedy top young scientist prize... all that on top of being Keeper of the Word.
you're a clever young man.
I'm confident you'll make the right choice here.
but I see this is a negotiation.
well, I will sweeten... the pot.
what is it?
my sources tell me you're applying to Princeton.
letter of recommendation like that from a man like me... done.
I can't do it.
I admire your gumption, kid.
but I still think there's some wiggle room here.
I tell you what... let's kick it up a notch.
see if I can't change your mind.
Edgar, that live feed up yet? - Of course.
ma? Mom?!
well, I think this negotiation is concluded.
you drive a hard bargain, kid.
okay, man, I have read this more times than the Playboy I found in dad's duffel.
Oh, the good... they die young, huh?
look, we can read this till our eyes bleed. This ain't getting any clearer.
okay. Then what does it mean?
cut off the head, and the body will flounder.
Yeah. - Okay.
well, I think we both agree that the head is Dick. Right?
right.
so, bottom line is, we go grab the stuff, and we mix ourselves a weapon. End of story.
look, I'm all for killing Dick. I'm just saying, what then?
I mean, what about the rest of the Leviathan? What, are they gonna just... drop dead?
I don't know. Maybe.
maybe?
maybe" is good enough for you right now?
one problem at a time, all right? - Okay.
maybe this is the catch.
God's not telling us every detail.
you know? The word is from God.
I don't know how much better it's gonna get.
Hey, Bobby. How you feeling?
stronger than ever.
now, while you two have been chasing your tails, I've been thinking on that weapon.
wait a second. Don't you think you should be saving your strength?
for what?
I'm just saying you might want to slow down. You don't look so hot.
I'm in the veil. My Brad Pitt days are over.
now, the kid says that the only way to kill Leviathan is with a bone washed in the three bloods of the fallen.
it's got to be from a human as light and good as the Leviathan are hungry and dark.
Yeah. Good luck with that.
the rest is doable, and doable now.
you've already got the fallen angel blood.
now, next up is blood from the ruler of fallen humanity.
now, the best I can tell, that's Crowley.
numero tres is the father of fallen beasts.
which means...? - You got to bleed an Alpha.
but they're all dead.
I mean, every one we found, we rounded up for Crowley, and then Cass whammied them all.
well, then, make this Cass' problem, too.
cass ain't exactly in the problem-solving mode, Bobby.
then Crowley!
all right, I get it. I get it. - Do you?!
I'm just sayin'.
I have faith that you boys will figure it out.
relax. I'm fine.
just got a little carried away.
here at Sucrocorp, your well-being is our number-one priority.
little F. Y.I.
Bobby's officing out of the John these days.
awkward. - Yeah, you're telling me.
he does have some ideas about the weapon, though.
Really? - Yeah.
well, uh, he may be just in time.
Roman acquires..." What's Sucrocorp?
they make food additives, namely high-fructose corn syrup.
that crap is in... well, it's in just about everything...
um, soda, sauces, bread.
don't say "pie." - Definitely pie.
bastards.
so now what? Roman's moved past restaurants?
and into grocery stores, Gas n' Sips, vending machines.
what can we do about it?
short of going Al Qaeda on their trucks and plants, there's nothing we can do about it.
like I said, uh, Bobby's got some ideas.
Hello, boys.
that's some bracing prose you're putting down there, Kevin.
you all done?
you've done well. Princeton will be lucky to have you.
what about my mom?
make the call.
release her. But stress the consequences of talking.
Kevin, I'm gonna request the pleasure of your company a tad longer.
you, on the other hand, I need to drop in on an old friend.
so, that's what all the "rumble, rumble" was about.
who translated it for you? - Never mind. You gonna give us the blood or not?
happily.
but not quite yet.
I'm all for chopping Dick, but I can't have you running around with a vial of my blood, now, can I?
you know the sheer number of nefarious spells my enemies can use that blood for?
well, then when? - Last.
after you've got all the other components.
most difficult, the angel part, I'm assuming.
given your role in their little apocalypse,
I can't imagine the choirboys upstairs are wetting their vestments to do you...
what's the word?... a solid...
unless, of course, you have an angel up your sleeve.
well, that'd be convenient, but, uh, no.
don't worry about it. We'll get the angel blood one way or another.
we just need you to be ready next time we call.
fine. Oh, here's a tip.
I have it on good authority there's one Alpha still among us.
whose authority?
mine.
wily character, that Alpha vampire.
somehow made good his prison break before Cass went nuclear on the place.
and you know this how?
keep your friends close, your enemies, blah blah.
needless to say, I keep tabs.
he moves around quite a bit.
but I have an inkling I know where to start the Easter-egg hunt.
happy trails.
okay. Where, jackass?!
Hoople, North Dakota.
piece of paper would have worked.
he seem angry? - Angry? Of course he's angry.
if you were Bobby, wouldn't you be?
but was he showing signs of fatigue, like... like fritzing?
no, actually, it was just the opposite. He said he never felt stronger.
that's what I was afraid of.
the stronger he gets, the closer he comes to going full vengeful spirit.
that's reality.
we need to talk about what we're going to do with him.
do with him? - Yeah.
three weeks ago, you were talking how this could work.
and now you want to go Kevorkian on his ass?
I'm just saying that the lore doesn't have a single real-life example of Casper the friendly ghost.
it's all basically poltergeists until a hunter comes along...
Yeah, well, the lore sucks.
I'm talking pure hatred, Dean. No humanity.
I mean, he could... kill... possess people.
I mean, Bobby could burn this friggin' building down.
look, if he goes off the rails...
what? - Check out that guy over there.
he seem a little out of it to you?
I-I don't know. Maybe.
what about Paula Deen over here?
Yeah, they... they look like...
like those Turducken people.
it's starting.
it's the corn syrup.
everything in the store is laced with it.
everything?
Hey, man, I'm gonna go into toxic shock, okay? I-I... I need my road food.
that's what Roman is banking on.
this one says "natural." T-that means it's safe. Right?
I hate to break it to you, but corn syrup is natural, technically.
well, then what the hell are we supposed to eat?
it's totally dark. I can't see inside.
well, should we wait for daylight? - Hell no, we're not waiting.
I'll scout it. See if we need to bring in the big guns.
I don't know. Look, Bobby...
okay. Place is clear.
but there's something you're gonna want to see.
careful.
you know a way to kill vamps with battery acid?
only way I know is beheading.
well, something didn't agree with them.
check out that wall.
something seem weird to you?
Yeah, see if you can find a switch or a lever or something.
don't need one.
Dean. Machete.
look. We're not gonna hurt you. Okay?
no fangs. See?
we just want to talk.
I was 8.
my mom left me at the playground while she ran to the store.
a man approached me and said I was the prettiest girl there.
and I've been living with these...
things... ever since.
at least until now.
do you have any idea why?
I'm one of his special girls.
all the others, it was their job to make sure I was ready for the Alpha, whenever he came.
wash me... give me my I. V.bags every day.
it's my only food. So my blood's pure.
they've been doing this for, what, 12 years?
virgins are a delicacy.
he always has at least one of us on hand.
well, don't worry, okay? We're gonna get you back to your mother.
think she remembers me? - Of course she does.
don't you remember her?
these, uh... these guys... they, uh, friends of yours?
they take care of the Alpha when he's here. Or did.
what happened to them?
a week ago, they came back from what they said was an easy hunt.
three humans just came, didn't put up any fight.
but when they started on them, the vampires screamed in pain.
the ones who ate died immediately.
and the ones who didn't? - There was only one.
when he saw what happened, he moved to animals.
he's out hunting as we speak.
never heard of vamps being allergic to humans before.
you think maybe it's the corn syrup?
I mean, think about it. The Gas n' Sip was lousy with stoners.
all ripe for the picking.
she did say it was an easy hunt.
do you know where the Alpha is now? - I don't know. Maybe.
he has a place he goes when something's wrong. He calls it his retreat.
what is that?
that's, uh, that's Sam's douche tracker.
helps us find the Alpha. All we need's an address.
I don't know.
but I remember things that maybe can help.
that's okay. Just do the best you can.
finally. I'd run out of magazines.
quick question. Where's your boss?
let's try that again. Where is he?
go to hell. - No. My neighborhood is worse than that.
missoula, Montana.
was that so hard?
I can't do this, man. I can't live on rabbit food.
I'm... I'm a warrior.
Dean, you'll be fine. - You don't know that.
so what's next on the list?
well, if we're bum-rushing the Alpha, then we're gonna need dead man's blood, which means a morgue.
or... - Or what?
dude, forget the morgue. We are swimming in vamp poison.
excuse me, sir.
we, uh, we're with the... Red Cross?
see, we have an emergency shortage.
and we're gonna need you to...
you're not getting a word I'm saying, are you?
hold out your arm. We need your blood.
dude.
all right, Sam. Tap the keg.
here?
Yeah, Sam, look around. It's friggin' Woodstock.
everybody's hopped up on the brown acid.
we don't need the song and dance.
give him a little prick.
that hurts.
this is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?
Yes. Yes, I did.
so, look... When we get there... - Yeah?
Bobby's gonna have to hang back.
do you disagree?
he ain't gonna like it. I mean, he helped us in getting Emily.
look, I'm team Bobby, too. Okay?
but there's a reason we left him in the car with Emily. You know that.
the more action he sees, the more chance he gets to spin out.
all right, fine.
so, we'll keep him off the front lines, and he can just, you know, keep calm and carry on, right?
and if he can't?
when they hauled you off to vamp camp, do you remember how long the drive was?
we left at night. Got in before dawn.
so, six, seven hours?
I think so, yes.
do you remember any highways? - No. We only took back roads.
okay. So, figure they averaged 45 miles per...
couldn't have been more than 300 miles. - Right.
what direction were you going?
I don't know. I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay. Em, you're doing great.
is there anything else you remember?
bells.
as we pulled up, I heard these loud bells.
it was still dark out? - You thinking church?
no, that's too early. It could have been a monastery.
monks get up at 4: 00 a. m.to pray.
can't get laid. Can't sleep in. A friggin' tragedy.
okay, so, Alpha's camping next to a, uh, monkey house.
how many do we got in range?
looks like one.
just outside...
this is where he took me.
are you sure?
what now?
we'll get you someplace safe. Circle back and ginsu these leeches.
but she couldn't get it.
Yes, the famous Fleur-de-lis mansion.
$125 million estate...
all right, here we go.
10 ccs of vamptonite.
it's a thing.
what's a Kardashian?
Oh, that's... just another bloodsucker.
no, it... it's... a joke.
here.
if we're not back by dawn, call this number,
Jody Mills. She's a friend.
she'll take care of you.
here, use this phone.
you gotta hang here. For your own good. Capiche?
Sam? Thank you.
you bet.
it was the wind.
chill out, Bobby. We'll be back soon.
well, he didn't take that very well. - How'd you think he was gonna take it?
excuse me. - Sorry.
Hi, daddy.
why, you little schemer.
no, I'm close by. Sending you a present.
and that's Dick Roman.
yesterday I introduced you to this rising star in American business.
in this hour, we'll go behind the scenes and answer the question everyone's been asking for months...
what makes Dick so hard to beat?
you son of a bitch.
well, this time of day, most of them would be catching z's.
they won't know what hit them.
you with me?
Yeah.
but...
are you sure you just want to charge in there, machetes blazing?
last time, it took a dozen hunters to take down the Alpha.
and most of them didn't make it out.
Yeah, well, you got a better idea?
stupid, stupid, stupid.
maybe we're too late.
you know, where I'm from, you have to bite and claw your way to the top.
once you get there, trust me, the view's incredible.
okay, Dean's birthday.
Sam's birthday.
damn it!
son of a bitch. - Everything okay in there?
my birthday.
Hello?
I need your help. - Get away from me.
listen, I need out of here. - Please!
just need you a little while.
just till I get the bastard.
the Winchesters.
I'm intrigued.
Emily. - Hi, Sam.
for a girl raised in a basement, you're a hell of an actress.
you were gonna hurt my daddy.
you get a trophy in Stockholm Syndrome.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but... we weren't.
Sam here had a better idea.
we're here to talk. That's it.
now that my guys have taken your blades and your syringes of tainted blood.
is that what you mean?
well, we... figured you might hold a grudge.
and why would I?
because you captured me, tortured me, sold me to the king of Hell?
that was more our grandpa.
thank you. That was awesome.
I'm going to peel off your faces and drink you slowly.
just listen. You need us. - Oh, yes.
I am thirsty! - The plague! We know what it is!
what do you know about Leviathan?
a bit.
you know they're poisoning the food supply?
Roman didn't mention that when we met for dinner last fall.
we made lots of plans.
we are on excellent terms, he and I.
you sure about that?
did he mention that he was going to... Maui wowie the human population?
Oh, of course.
he said grabbing a snack would be easier than ever.
he said you'd all live together, didn't he?
you really believe him?
you think your children are dying by accident?
there is pesticide in the formula!
it suits you to think so.
you need me on your side.
look, we're not the ones burning from the inside out.
think about it. Whatever deal he made with you was crap! Trust us!
why are you telling me this? - Because we can stop Dick.
stop all of it. We just...
we need your blood... for the weapon.
so now you want to prevent the extermination of the vampire race.
no.
but it beats going down with you.
Allan, darling...
come.
well, the creep gets creepier.
what's wrong? - Edgar's here.
wow, what a funny coincidence.
all right, we need soap, uh, cleanser, anything with borax in it. We need knives.
put them in the study. - Wait. No, no, no. No, wait.
word of advice, boys.
you do not live through centuries of fire and ice and continental divide...
by jumping to conclusions.
okay.
you're making a mistake!
listen! Wait!
never hurts to get the story first.
I would've whipped you up a meal.
please, sit.
I'm dying to know why you're here.
I think you know.
and how is that?
I smell Sam and Dean Winchester.
anything? - Nothing.
you think Edgar's here for the same reason we are?
I mean, look, if they figured out that we're here to get Alpha blood for a weapon...
I think any way you slice it, you got Pac Man and True Blood in the same room, and that's bad news.
I mean, he's not stupid. Why the hell do you think he locked us in here?
Dean, we're his enemy.
I mean, they're like monster cousins or something.
who would you give the benefit of the doubt to?
you know what? Maybe the Sucro is poisoning the vamps on accident.
maybe they'll fix it.
I think you got the oldest monster on earth thinking he can hold his own because he always has.
Edgar's gonna eat him alive. - Yeah.
you think you could pick a lock with this?
but, Dean... We gave up all our vamptonite.
did we?
do you want the boys?
yes?
you're welcome to them.
I'll have them sent out.
how kind of you.
Oh, Edgar...
you do know why Sam and Dean are here, don't you?
they insist that you're exterminating us, and I thought, well, that's... impossible.
must be a mistake.
you're right. Of course.
vamptonite.
friggin' vamptonite.
all right, we need knives.
there's got to be a prep room or a kitchen somewhere. Come on.
here's what I don't understand, Edgar.
you are aware that your little additive has side effects, yes?
Dick warned you there might be kinks.
Yes. He also said he'd be in touch.
my children are in a panic.
you don't call, you don't write, you don't send cookies.
where exactly on the list is fixing our plague?
my dear friend...
nowhere.
we want you to burn like the little roaches you are.
Roman said if I kept quiet,
I would get my reward.
and now you get to lay down and die.
nothing personal.
our additive kills the wolves, too...the shifters, and those disgusting little things that eat corpses.
anything with a taste for human.
except us.
mankind's a limited resource, after all.
there are seven billion... of them.
only seven.
we come from you. - Barely.
I am the son of Eve!
a pathetic mutt. Hardly one of us.
I knew Eve, and honestly... your mommy was a whore.
don't squirm. I need every last drop.
grab a glass. We're juicing this freak.
No! - Stay back!
leave her alone. She's been through quite enough.
now, that's rich... coming from the guy who took her off the swing-set.
do you want to do this fight?
or do you want my blood?
for taking care of Edgar.
now go.
what about the little boy?
are you joking?
do we look like we're joking?
how many other kids you got in here, you freak?
at the moment, just him.
Emily... help Allan with his coat. He's leaving with Sam and Dean.
now, take it.
what? No "thank you"?
Oh, right, right.
your flesh is crawling.
all you really want to do is kill me now.
you hate having to wait and come back and try again.
pretty much.
I wouldn't leave that head too close to that body for too long.
see you next season.
looking forward to it.
let's never do that again. Cops thought we took that kid.
long as he gets back to his folks, I don't care what they thought.
we had to jump out a freakin' window, man.
he's gone.
I'm getting trace bits of EMF, but it's fading fast.
and Bobby's probably been gone three or four hours.
he's got the flask, Dean. How the hell are we supposed to track him?
look, I hate to say this... - Well, then don't.
he's gone.
how could he do this... Now?
I mean, we've got half the freakin' weapon, we're almost there.
it's not him. I mean, he's not thinking.
so, what, we just keep going while he's out there like this?
do we have any other option?
I mean, it's what he'd want us to do. Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, him and Frank and Cass, if his marbles were in the bag.
it's a good thing we got Crowley in our corner. Right?
seeing as how it all comes down to him.
what could possibly go wrong?
hello...
Mr. Crowley, we have so much to talk about.
take a seat.
we think it may have been an Alpha.
an Alpha, like...? - Like all monsters come from somewhere.
bag me a live Alpha.
the first of your species. - The very first.
prison full of monsters... can't just leave them, can't let them go.
I understand.
Geothrive is part of Roman Enterprises.
Dick's funding an archaeological dig...
factory in Saudi Arabia... - Fishery in Jakarta...
a research center... it's everywhere.
it's all tied together, Dean.
he's not in control. That was vengeful-spirit crap.
but it's still Bobby.
well, what the hell are you? - I'm a... K-Kevin Tran.
I'm in advanced placement.
he's a Prophet of the Lord.
and that's the word of God? - One of them, yes.
well, what's it say, then? - It's about Leviathan.
does it say anything about how to kill them?
Leviathan cannot be slain but by a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen.
it says we need to start with the blood of a fallen angel.
always happy to bleed for the Winchesters.
Hello, Kevin.
Thanks, Phil.
and now we turn our attention to agriculture, where an unlikely personality has now come on to the scene in a major way.
richard Roman, a C. E.O. whose company dominates the defense and aviation sectors, not to mention being a giant in the motivational-speaking world.
what can I say, Gloria? I'm a multitasker.
clearly.
and now you've recently purchased controlling stock in Sucrocorp...
among the world's leading manufacturers in high-fructose corn syrup.
it's a pleasure to have you with us, Richard.
please. "Dick.
so, tell us, Dick, why the recent fascination with big foods?
well, it's no secret we all love to eat, but now Sucrocorp will focus on eating well.
help me connect the dots.
how will pumping sweeteners into our system make us healthier?
one word... purity.
we're dialing back the additives to deliver the highest quality all-American product you people deserve.
america is for go-getters, folks who get off their butts and make it happen.
and we need you just as healthy as you can be.
which is why we are diving whole hog into what keeps Americans living longer...
and tasting better.
you do, of course, mean to say the food will be tasting better.
that's exactly what I mean.
your 11: 00 a. m.is waiting in the conference room.
thank you, Susan.
are we still looking for a rep in Mainstream Media?
Yes, we are.
Wunderbar. Put a "replace order" on Gloria there.
and with the corpse? - Call Chef Fieri.
I feel like barbecue.
Kevin. Dick.
I'm very excited to meet you.
you nervous? Don't be.
I'm your biggest fan.
I brought you a present.
what's that say, Kev?
I don't know.
cute.
easy, Edgar. Don't scare the boy.
you know, I've checked, Kevin.
number one in your class, winner of the Chad Kennedy top young scientist prize... all that on top of being Keeper of the Word.
you're a clever young man.
I'm confident you'll make the right choice here.
but I see this is a negotiation.
well, I will sweeten... the pot.
what is it?
my sources tell me you're applying to Princeton.
letter of recommendation like that from a man like me... done.
I can't do it.
I admire your gumption, kid.
but I still think there's some wiggle room here.
I tell you what... let's kick it up a notch.
see if I can't change your mind.
Edgar, that live feed up yet? - Of course.
ma? Mom?!
well, I think this negotiation is concluded.
you drive a hard bargain, kid.
okay, man, I have read this more times than the Playboy I found in dad's duffel.
Oh, the good... they die young, huh?
look, we can read this till our eyes bleed. This ain't getting any clearer.
okay. Then what does it mean?
cut off the head, and the body will flounder.
Yeah. - Okay.
well, I think we both agree that the head is Dick. Right?
right.
so, bottom line is, we go grab the stuff, and we mix ourselves a weapon. End of story.
look, I'm all for killing Dick. I'm just saying, what then?
I mean, what about the rest of the Leviathan? What, are they gonna just... drop dead?
I don't know. Maybe.
maybe?
maybe" is good enough for you right now?
one problem at a time, all right? - Okay.
maybe this is the catch.
God's not telling us every detail.
you know? The word is from God.
I don't know how much better it's gonna get.
Hey, Bobby. How you feeling?
stronger than ever.
now, while you two have been chasing your tails, I've been thinking on that weapon.
wait a second. Don't you think you should be saving your strength?
for what?
I'm just saying you might want to slow down. You don't look so hot.
I'm in the veil. My Brad Pitt days are over.
now, the kid says that the only way to kill Leviathan is with a bone washed in the three bloods of the fallen.
it's got to be from a human as light and good as the Leviathan are hungry and dark.
Yeah. Good luck with that.
the rest is doable, and doable now.
you've already got the fallen angel blood.
now, next up is blood from the ruler of fallen humanity.
now, the best I can tell, that's Crowley.
numero tres is the father of fallen beasts.
which means...? - You got to bleed an Alpha.
but they're all dead.
I mean, every one we found, we rounded up for Crowley, and then Cass whammied them all.
well, then, make this Cass' problem, too.
cass ain't exactly in the problem-solving mode, Bobby.
then Crowley!
all right, I get it. I get it. - Do you?!
I'm just sayin'.
I have faith that you boys will figure it out.
relax. I'm fine.
just got a little carried away.
here at Sucrocorp, your well-being is our number-one priority.
little F. Y.I.
Bobby's officing out of the John these days.
awkward. - Yeah, you're telling me.
he does have some ideas about the weapon, though.
Really? - Yeah.
well, uh, he may be just in time.
Roman acquires..." What's Sucrocorp?
they make food additives, namely high-fructose corn syrup.
that crap is in... well, it's in just about everything...
um, soda, sauces, bread.
don't say "pie." - Definitely pie.
bastards.
so now what? Roman's moved past restaurants?
and into grocery stores, Gas n' Sips, vending machines.
what can we do about it?
short of going Al Qaeda on their trucks and plants, there's nothing we can do about it.
like I said, uh, Bobby's got some ideas.
Hello, boys.
that's some bracing prose you're putting down there, Kevin.
you all done?
you've done well. Princeton will be lucky to have you.
what about my mom?
make the call.
release her. But stress the consequences of talking.
Kevin, I'm gonna request the pleasure of your company a tad longer.
you, on the other hand, I need to drop in on an old friend.
so, that's what all the "rumble, rumble" was about.
who translated it for you? - Never mind. You gonna give us the blood or not?
happily.
but not quite yet.
I'm all for chopping Dick, but I can't have you running around with a vial of my blood, now, can I?
you know the sheer number of nefarious spells my enemies can use that blood for?
well, then when? - Last.
after you've got all the other components.
most difficult, the angel part, I'm assuming.
given your role in their little apocalypse,
I can't imagine the choirboys upstairs are wetting their vestments to do you...
what's the word?... a solid...
unless, of course, you have an angel up your sleeve.
well, that'd be convenient, but, uh, no.
don't worry about it. We'll get the angel blood one way or another.
we just need you to be ready next time we call.
fine. Oh, here's a tip.
I have it on good authority there's one Alpha still among us.
whose authority?
mine.
wily character, that Alpha vampire.
somehow made good his prison break before Cass went nuclear on the place.
and you know this how?
keep your friends close, your enemies, blah blah.
needless to say, I keep tabs.
he moves around quite a bit.
but I have an inkling I know where to start the Easter-egg hunt.
happy trails.
okay. Where, jackass?!
Hoople, North Dakota.
piece of paper would have worked.
he seem angry? - Angry? Of course he's angry.
if you were Bobby, wouldn't you be?
but was he showing signs of fatigue, like... like fritzing?
no, actually, it was just the opposite. He said he never felt stronger.
that's what I was afraid of.
the stronger he gets, the closer he comes to going full vengeful spirit.
that's reality.
we need to talk about what we're going to do with him.
do with him? - Yeah.
three weeks ago, you were talking how this could work.
and now you want to go Kevorkian on his ass?
I'm just saying that the lore doesn't have a single real-life example of Casper the friendly ghost.
it's all basically poltergeists until a hunter comes along...
Yeah, well, the lore sucks.
I'm talking pure hatred, Dean. No humanity.
I mean, he could... kill... possess people.
I mean, Bobby could burn this friggin' building down.
look, if he goes off the rails...
what? - Check out that guy over there.
he seem a little out of it to you?
I-I don't know. Maybe.
what about Paula Deen over here?
Yeah, they... they look like...
like those Turducken people.
it's starting.
it's the corn syrup.
everything in the store is laced with it.
everything?
Hey, man, I'm gonna go into toxic shock, okay? I-I... I need my road food.
that's what Roman is banking on.
this one says "natural." T-that means it's safe. Right?
I hate to break it to you, but corn syrup is natural, technically.
well, then what the hell are we supposed to eat?
it's totally dark. I can't see inside.
well, should we wait for daylight? - Hell no, we're not waiting.
I'll scout it. See if we need to bring in the big guns.
I don't know. Look, Bobby...
okay. Place is clear.
but there's something you're gonna want to see.
careful.
you know a way to kill vamps with battery acid?
only way I know is beheading.
well, something didn't agree with them.
check out that wall.
something seem weird to you?
Yeah, see if you can find a switch or a lever or something.
don't need one.
Dean. Machete.
look. We're not gonna hurt you. Okay?
no fangs. See?
we just want to talk.
I was 8.
my mom left me at the playground while she ran to the store.
a man approached me and said I was the prettiest girl there.
and I've been living with these...
things... ever since.
at least until now.
do you have any idea why?
I'm one of his special girls.
all the others, it was their job to make sure I was ready for the Alpha, whenever he came.
wash me... give me my I. V.bags every day.
it's my only food. So my blood's pure.
they've been doing this for, what, 12 years?
virgins are a delicacy.
he always has at least one of us on hand.
well, don't worry, okay? We're gonna get you back to your mother.
think she remembers me? - Of course she does.
don't you remember her?
these, uh... these guys... they, uh, friends of yours?
they take care of the Alpha when he's here. Or did.
what happened to them?
a week ago, they came back from what they said was an easy hunt.
three humans just came, didn't put up any fight.
but when they started on them, the vampires screamed in pain.
the ones who ate died immediately.
and the ones who didn't? - There was only one.
when he saw what happened, he moved to animals.
he's out hunting as we speak.
never heard of vamps being allergic to humans before.
you think maybe it's the corn syrup?
I mean, think about it. The Gas n' Sip was lousy with stoners.
all ripe for the picking.
she did say it was an easy hunt.
do you know where the Alpha is now? - I don't know. Maybe.
he has a place he goes when something's wrong. He calls it his retreat.
what is that?
that's, uh, that's Sam's douche tracker.
helps us find the Alpha. All we need's an address.
I don't know.
but I remember things that maybe can help.
that's okay. Just do the best you can.
finally. I'd run out of magazines.
quick question. Where's your boss?
let's try that again. Where is he?
go to hell. - No. My neighborhood is worse than that.
missoula, Montana.
was that so hard?
I can't do this, man. I can't live on rabbit food.
I'm... I'm a warrior.
Dean, you'll be fine. - You don't know that.
so what's next on the list?
well, if we're bum-rushing the Alpha, then we're gonna need dead man's blood, which means a morgue.
or... - Or what?
dude, forget the morgue. We are swimming in vamp poison.
excuse me, sir.
we, uh, we're with the... Red Cross?
see, we have an emergency shortage.
and we're gonna need you to...
you're not getting a word I'm saying, are you?
hold out your arm. We need your blood.
dude.
all right, Sam. Tap the keg.
here?
Yeah, Sam, look around. It's friggin' Woodstock.
everybody's hopped up on the brown acid.
we don't need the song and dance.
give him a little prick.
that hurts.
this is for Hurricane Katrina, you said?
Yes. Yes, I did.
so, look... When we get there... - Yeah?
Bobby's gonna have to hang back.
do you disagree?
he ain't gonna like it. I mean, he helped us in getting Emily.
look, I'm team Bobby, too. Okay?
but there's a reason we left him in the car with Emily. You know that.
the more action he sees, the more chance he gets to spin out.
all right, fine.
so, we'll keep him off the front lines, and he can just, you know, keep calm and carry on, right?
and if he can't?
when they hauled you off to vamp camp, do you remember how long the drive was?
we left at night. Got in before dawn.
so, six, seven hours?
I think so, yes.
do you remember any highways? - No. We only took back roads.
okay. So, figure they averaged 45 miles per...
couldn't have been more than 300 miles. - Right.
what direction were you going?
I don't know. I'm sorry. - Oh, it's okay. Em, you're doing great.
is there anything else you remember?
bells.
as we pulled up, I heard these loud bells.
it was still dark out? - You thinking church?
no, that's too early. It could have been a monastery.
monks get up at 4: 00 a. m.to pray.
can't get laid. Can't sleep in. A friggin' tragedy.
okay, so, Alpha's camping next to a, uh, monkey house.
how many do we got in range?
looks like one.
just outside...
this is where he took me.
are you sure?
what now?
we'll get you someplace safe. Circle back and ginsu these leeches.
but she couldn't get it.
Yes, the famous Fleur-de-lis mansion.
$125 million estate...
all right, here we go.
10 ccs of vamptonite.
it's a thing.
what's a Kardashian?
Oh, that's... just another bloodsucker.
no, it... it's... a joke.
here.
if we're not back by dawn, call this number,
Jody Mills. She's a friend.
she'll take care of you.
here, use this phone.
you gotta hang here. For your own good. Capiche?
Sam? Thank you.
you bet.
it was the wind.
chill out, Bobby. We'll be back soon.
well, he didn't take that very well. - How'd you think he was gonna take it?
excuse me. - Sorry.
Hi, daddy.
why, you little schemer.
no, I'm close by. Sending you a present.
and that's Dick Roman.
yesterday I introduced you to this rising star in American business.
in this hour, we'll go behind the scenes and answer the question everyone's been asking for months...
what makes Dick so hard to beat?
you son of a bitch.
well, this time of day, most of them would be catching z's.
they won't know what hit them.
you with me?
Yeah.
but...
are you sure you just want to charge in there, machetes blazing?
last time, it took a dozen hunters to take down the Alpha.
and most of them didn't make it out.
Yeah, well, you got a better idea?
stupid, stupid, stupid.
maybe we're too late.
you know, where I'm from, you have to bite and claw your way to the top.
once you get there, trust me, the view's incredible.
okay, Dean's birthday.
Sam's birthday.
damn it!
son of a bitch. - Everything okay in there?
my birthday.
Hello?
I need your help. - Get away from me.
listen, I need out of here. - Please!
just need you a little while.
just till I get the bastard.
the Winchesters.
I'm intrigued.
Emily. - Hi, Sam.
for a girl raised in a basement, you're a hell of an actress.
you were gonna hurt my daddy.
you get a trophy in Stockholm Syndrome.
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, but... we weren't.
Sam here had a better idea.
we're here to talk. That's it.
now that my guys have taken your blades and your syringes of tainted blood.
is that what you mean?
well, we... figured you might hold a grudge.
and why would I?
because you captured me, tortured me, sold me to the king of Hell?
that was more our grandpa.
thank you. That was awesome.
I'm going to peel off your faces and drink you slowly.
just listen. You need us. - Oh, yes.
I am thirsty! - The plague! We know what it is!
what do you know about Leviathan?
a bit.
you know they're poisoning the food supply?
Roman didn't mention that when we met for dinner last fall.
we made lots of plans.
we are on excellent terms, he and I.
you sure about that?
did he mention that he was going to... Maui wowie the human population?
Oh, of course.
he said grabbing a snack would be easier than ever.
he said you'd all live together, didn't he?
you really believe him?
you think your children are dying by accident?
there is pesticide in the formula!
it suits you to think so.
you need me on your side.
look, we're not the ones burning from the inside out.
think about it. Whatever deal he made with you was crap! Trust us!
why are you telling me this? - Because we can stop Dick.
stop all of it. We just...
we need your blood... for the weapon.
so now you want to prevent the extermination of the vampire race.
no.
but it beats going down with you.
Allan, darling...
come.
well, the creep gets creepier.
what's wrong? - Edgar's here.
wow, what a funny coincidence.
all right, we need soap, uh, cleanser, anything with borax in it. We need knives.
put them in the study. - Wait. No, no, no. No, wait.
word of advice, boys.
you do not live through centuries of fire and ice and continental divide...
by jumping to conclusions.
okay.
you're making a mistake!
listen! Wait!
never hurts to get the story first.
I would've whipped you up a meal.
please, sit.
I'm dying to know why you're here.
I think you know.
and how is that?
I smell Sam and Dean Winchester.
anything? - Nothing.
you think Edgar's here for the same reason we are?
I mean, look, if they figured out that we're here to get Alpha blood for a weapon...
I think any way you slice it, you got Pac Man and True Blood in the same room, and that's bad news.
I mean, he's not stupid. Why the hell do you think he locked us in here?
Dean, we're his enemy.
I mean, they're like monster cousins or something.
who would you give the benefit of the doubt to?
you know what? Maybe the Sucro is poisoning the vamps on accident.
maybe they'll fix it.
I think you got the oldest monster on earth thinking he can hold his own because he always has.
Edgar's gonna eat him alive. - Yeah.
you think you could pick a lock with this?
but, Dean... We gave up all our vamptonite.
did we?
do you want the boys?
yes?
you're welcome to them.
I'll have them sent out.
how kind of you.
Oh, Edgar...
you do know why Sam and Dean are here, don't you?
they insist that you're exterminating us, and I thought, well, that's... impossible.
must be a mistake.
you're right. Of course.
vamptonite.
friggin' vamptonite.
all right, we need knives.
there's got to be a prep room or a kitchen somewhere. Come on.
here's what I don't understand, Edgar.
you are aware that your little additive has side effects, yes?
Dick warned you there might be kinks.
Yes. He also said he'd be in touch.
my children are in a panic.
you don't call, you don't write, you don't send cookies.
where exactly on the list is fixing our plague?
my dear friend...
nowhere.
we want you to burn like the little roaches you are.
Roman said if I kept quiet,
I would get my reward.
and now you get to lay down and die.
nothing personal.
our additive kills the wolves, too...the shifters, and those disgusting little things that eat corpses.
anything with a taste for human.
except us.
mankind's a limited resource, after all.
there are seven billion... of them.
only seven.
we come from you. - Barely.
I am the son of Eve!
a pathetic mutt. Hardly one of us.
I knew Eve, and honestly... your mommy was a whore.
don't squirm. I need every last drop.
grab a glass. We're juicing this freak.
No! - Stay back!
leave her alone. She's been through quite enough.
now, that's rich... coming from the guy who took her off the swing-set.
do you want to do this fight?
or do you want my blood?
for taking care of Edgar.
now go.
what about the little boy?
are you joking?
do we look like we're joking?
how many other kids you got in here, you freak?
at the moment, just him.
Emily... help Allan with his coat. He's leaving with Sam and Dean.
now, take it.
what? No "thank you"?
Oh, right, right.
your flesh is crawling.
all you really want to do is kill me now.
you hate having to wait and come back and try again.
pretty much.
I wouldn't leave that head too close to that body for too long.
see you next season.
looking forward to it.
let's never do that again. Cops thought we took that kid.
long as he gets back to his folks, I don't care what they thought.
we had to jump out a freakin' window, man.
he's gone.
I'm getting trace bits of EMF, but it's fading fast.
and Bobby's probably been gone three or four hours.
he's got the flask, Dean. How the hell are we supposed to track him?
look, I hate to say this... - Well, then don't.
he's gone.
how could he do this... Now?
I mean, we've got half the freakin' weapon, we're almost there.
it's not him. I mean, he's not thinking.
so, what, we just keep going while he's out there like this?
do we have any other option?
I mean, it's what he'd want us to do. Right?
Yeah.
Yeah, him and Frank and Cass, if his marbles were in the bag.
it's a good thing we got Crowley in our corner. Right?
seeing as how it all comes down to him.
what could possibly go wrong?
hello...
Mr. Crowley, we have so much to talk about.
take a seat.
I don't hunt anymore. I found something.
what was her name?
Dean, the year that I took off, I had something I've never had.
happy Birthday!
a normal life.
you were in Purgatory?
it felt pure.
well, how'd you get out?
I got something you need. - Yeah, what's that?
I show you the door, you hump my soul to the other side.
we made it, brother.
what about Cass? Was he there? - Something happened to him down there.
I'm not leaving here without you.
Kevin Tran, Prophet of the Lord.
it does have a nice ring to it.
Hey. What's it say? That we shouldn't come looking, and since we lost the tablet, Kevin figures we don't need him.
Yeah, but Crowley still does.
Hello, Quentin.
no, I-it -- it can't be you.
I get the confusion.
you of all people knew I was really, truly dead.
after all, you held down my legs, didn't you?
when the old man told Sorento to saw off my head.
where is he?
are you serious?
did you really think I'd tell you where he is?
well, I guess I was kind of hoping you wouldn't.
on the other hand, I might show you where he is.
after me and my boys take off your hands and feet.
well, don't go through all that trouble on my account.
please.
the old man's gonna want to see this for himself.
well, they might be able to kill me.
and that's all right.
cause if they do, I know exactly where I'm going...
and who I'll see when I get there.
well, that is twice that he's burned us.
shame on you. No, no, no, no.
I'm the one who said he set us up.
no, you said, "I wonder if Kevin is setting us up,
and then you started in with the -- the techno babble.
that was like two states ago. Yeah, well, whatever.
either way, that's another room billed to one of Kevin's false credit I. D.s.
and the motel ran his number today.
just like he actually checked in?
Yes.
kid's like Rain Man.
he's like a crappy little credit-card-counting...
criminal prodigy Rain Man.
well, he was in advanced placement.
shut up.
I don't know, Dean.
I mean, you did try to kill his mother.
I was trying to kill Crowley, okay?
who happened to be wearing Kevin's mother at the time.
well, there's a difference.
apparently not to Kevin.
Oh, I know. Maybe because -- oh, yeah, -- it's his mother.
hold that thought.
no, actually, you know what? Don't hold that thought.
Hello?
Hello?
uh, hang on. There's not enough bars.
Hey, Dean.
you, um -- you got a minute?
afraid I messed up, buddy.
what did you do?
no, man, not like that.
I'm sorry. You took on how many?
are you crazy? Hey.
see, the thing is, my legs -- they ain't working so good.
I'm pretty sure I can make it at a slow crawl.
I was kind of hoping maybe I could ask you for one more favor?
and -- and what exactly is that supposed to mean, you've got to go? Which words are giving you trouble?
we're on the case, remember, Dean?
the Winchester holy grail, "shut the gates of hell forever" case. Sure are.
but in order to close the Gates of Hell, we need our Prophet, am I right?
so step one -- find Kevin Tran.
well, he ain't here.
but he wanted us to be,
so step two -- find Kevin Tran.
you mind if I take the Toblerone?
wait. Dean, seriously?
Hey, the trail is dead, but the room is paid for.
that's all. What does that mean -- "personal"?
did you have a stroke?
vocabulary?
personal, as in my own grown-up personal
I don't know -- crap.
last I counted, you took a year off from the job.
I need a day.
you are a wascally wabbit, Mr. Tran.
concerned.
not stalking...concerned.
Everett. Hey, buddy, you still on duty?
Yeah, yeah.
how's your dad?
he's kind of having it rough on the new regimen.
can't keep anything down.
that sucks.
Yeah.
listen, um, I'm gonna stay on another week, okay?
but I need you to run it on this card, 'cause I just canceled the one you had on file.
okay, sure.
figured you'd have moved on by now.
right.
well, I'm -- I'm kind of between jobs.
Plus, uh, dog has a surgery follow-up on Tuesday.
Yeah, you really messed up that dog.
right. Uh, thanks for that.
Oh, yeah, it's all that thing does
piss, moan, and eat up money we ain't got.
well, you got any tools?
hell, if you can fix it, you don't need to go and look for a job.
you got one here.
not lookin' good.
up yours.
Wow. You, uh...
look okay.
dude, you were double-hamstrung.
Yeah, well, a little rest, a half a cooler full of AB-negative
most wounds short of an amputation will mend up...
vampirically speaking.
I'll be 100% before you know it.
thank you, brother.
Benny, what's going on?
Oh, your work here is done, Dean.
you already saved the day.
you know, I got my, uh, deal, and you got
What'd you call it?
a family business?
what's going on?
you and that whole "friend" thing, man.
well, I got to admit, Dean -- he's got his strong points, but holy hell if he ain't a magnet.
well, before we found Cass, you said it was my humanity that was drawing too much attention.
Yeah, that too.
well, I think we're clear for the moment.
it does present a curious curl in the metaphysics, doesn't it?
if you murder a monster in monster heaven, where does it go?
and this is the crazy aunt I want to take on the road?
I am not your aunt.
what? Really?
I have no possible relationship to your sibling offspring.
now, you're kidding me.
Oh, you two are killing me.
I have to agree with the vampire, Dean.
the risk of crossing Purgatory with a seraph
it's...less than strategic, and certainly when we have no reason to believe that I can pass through the door that you're headed for.
you see, you're an intact, living human being stuck in Purgatory's craw.
this dimension wants to spit you out, which is exactly what's gonna power our escape pod.
now, I'm pretty sure I can squeeze through, too, because, after all, you take away the fangs and the fun,
I was born human, too.
but...
I don't think it would work for me.
you hear what he's telling you, Dean?
your buddy is saying
listen to me, you undead blood junkie,
I'm the one with the mojo. I'm the one with the plan.
Cass... we're gonna shove your ass back through the eye of that needle if it kills all three of us.
obviously, I'm less than comfortable with that.
well, it's good to know you're still dumb as ever.
Yeah, well, some things never change.
now, why are you getting into machete fights with your own kind?
Quentin, the one I came for?
we were in the same nest.
I'm hunting the vampire who turned me, my maker.
well, now, don't get me wrong.
I'm down with the hunting, but, uh...why?
awesome.
uh, if you're still on the clock, lady in 118 says the sink's backed up.
what the hell?
what are you doing here?
I knew there was something off about you, with your creepy Army-Navy and your sideburns
stop, stop.
um, I'm fixing your sink.
what?
Quentin and I went way back
one of the old man's favorites, next to me, it turns out.
listen to this.
age of Aquarius II, 0800,
and then there's some other numbers all crossed out.
some other weird names here, too -- the Big Mermaid,
solitaire -- it's all crossed out, except this one -- the Lucky Myra.
yachts.
names of yachts -- Lucky Myra, Age of Aquarius II.
look at this one -- Sea You Later, spelled s-e-a.
I mean, come on.
so, then these are launch times.
and what -- destinations?
Mm-hmm. Except none of them ever get there.
the Lucky Myra left yesterday afternoon.
I guarantee you it's already been hit.
what do you mean, "hit"?
boarded, burned, and buried at sea.
my nest -- that's how we fed...
how we always fed.
we kept a tight little fleet, maybe a half-dozen boats.
nothing ostentatious, just pleasure craft.
I must have circled the Americas 10 times during my tour.
a few of us would act as stringers and patrol the harbors, looking for the right-size target
fat, rich yachts going to far-off ports.
take down the boat's name and destination, radio it to the crew in the water.
and then we just, uh...
let the ocean swallow up all our sins.
vampire pirates?
that's what you guys are?
Vampirates.
you know, all the years we ran together,
I can't believe nobody ever thought of that.
what do you mean? It's like the third thing you say.
no, it isn't.
all right, so, y-your maker is set up to feed around here, right?
well, what are we looking for?
well, he likes to live in style.
he usually rents legitimately.
always remote, always coastal.
so an island, maybe?
you got a cable bill here.
hmm. Quentin's got the NFL package.
Prentiss Island.
heard of it?
Oh, yeah.
why did he kill you?
when you get turned, it's like you're reborn into a vampire nest.
your maker -- he means everything to you.
I mean, you really start believing he's God.
now, if your maker happens to believe the same thing, well...
see how that could be a pickle.
you really have to do that? I mean, right now?
I'm sorry, brother.
I'm better, but I'm still on the mend.
right.
Anyway...our father -- he was a jealous God.
he kept the family together but kept us apart from the rest of the world, always at sea.
I always did what was best for the nest...
till I met her.
beautiful.
I mean, words don't even cut it, you know?
Greek, heiress.
come on.
she was sailing a 42-foot sloop to the Canary Islands.
now, I should have called her boat's destination in to my crew, but instead, I joined her on it.
Seriously?
was Fabio on the cover of that paperback?
my life changed when she entered it, Dean.
into what we had become together.
I mean... We found it, man.
eventually, we settled in Louisiana.
and then one night, we were coming home, and the old man -- he was just there.
Quentin, Sorento, my oldest nestmates.
it was only that night I understood what a crime it was to him -- me leaving him.
they pinned me down, and they beheaded me.
the last thing I saw was the old man tearing out Andrea's throat.
well, that's what payback's all about -- am I right?
docks are up ahead.
should be able to find a dinghy to use.
we're close.
remind you of anything?
it's weird being back -- in the world, I mean.
isn't it?
sure as hell is.
I mean, what do you do with it all?
all the -- all the everything?
hell, I don't even know if this world is real, if I'm real.
Hey, listen to me.
I see what happens down that rabbit hole, okay?
we're real.
Benny, this is real.
it's the only way to play this game, you get me?
time to move, Benny.
the old man's harpsichord.
no.
no, no.
idiot.
gonna make me do this all over again, aren't you?
Hello, Sorento.
he turned you.
little busy right now.
this is Dean's other, other cell, so you must know what to do.
so, that's what you do?
you stalk helpless women and you break into their motel room and you fix their plumbing?
why are you fixing my sink?
well, because somebody jammed about 800 limes down the drain... and blew out the disposal.
Oh. Right. Don't touch the produce.
right.
I thought you were leaving town. I am.
I'm just helping out with maintenance at the motel, you know, while Everett's dad is sick.
who's Everett?
how long have you been here?
three months. Why?
well, you know, usually when someone moves into a town, they actually, uh, you know, move into the town.
I did.
a motel is not actually part of the town that it's in.
it's not part of anywhere.
well, I haven't found a place yet.
why am I explaining myself to you?
you're a drifter or a handyman.
I-I think I should just go.
Yeah, I think you should go.
Hey.
okay, what?
what? Why did you call me?
why are you whispering?
it's kind of hard to explain, but I'm sort of in the middle of cleaning out a vampire's nest, and it's sort of gone a little sideways on me.
What?! Are you an idiot, Dean?
you know better than to go into a vamp nest alone.
I'm not alone, damn it.
all right? I'm not alone.
I've got backup
guy who's been tracking the nest for a while.
what guy? Garth?
what? No. You don't know him.
he's a friend.
a friend? Dean, you don't have any
all your friends are dead.
that's not what I called to talk about.
Sorento, go. Tell the old man it's true.
he listens to you?
it's been a long time.
our father has come to trust my judgment over Sorento's.
I answer only to him.
well, sleeping with God has got to have some perks.
Yes, it does.
make sure the old man has everything he needs.
Oh, Benny.
when I heard you were back
I don't know -- somehow, I knew it was true.
I had to believe it, to hope.
Andrea, what happened?
the old man said he was gonna bleed you dry.
I don't know.
he changed his mind.
I blacked out.
when I woke up, I was drinking from his wrist.
I'm sorry.
all this is because of me. I'm sorry.
no. It's not your fault.
you never hid anything from me, Benny.
I chose you.
but why'd you stay...
with them, with him?
Why?
you remember what it's like at first.
first, everything resets.
and whoever gives it to you -- I know.
it's complicated.
every damn thing is complicated.
it doesn't have to be.
Benny, I can't kill him -- none of us can.
but you -- you came back from the grave.
you're proof that he's not all-powerful, that he's not God.
he's scared of scared of you, Benny -- I know it.
to stop the killing.
do what you came for, and we can be together.
he wants Benny brought to him.
I get the separate-lives thing, but this is a hunting thing, and we need to find that line
Oh, my God, stop talking. I texted you my 20.
Yeah, I got it.
look, I'm on my way.
and, listen, if you handle it, great.
I'll buy your friend the first round.
but, Dean, listen to me.
Dean, are you there?
you kidding me?
Oh, man, come on.
damn it!
Hello, father.
I have no words.
now, I know that ain't true.
can you help us understand?
I know you don't owe us anything, but how?
how are you here, standing in front of me?
I found a way back.
from Hell?
right next door, as far as I could tell.
next door?
what's that?
Oh, I think I'll just have to show you.
I know it won't change anything, but I regretted having you killed.
when it was all done,
I wailed when I saw you in all those pieces.
didn't I, Sorento?
didn't I wail like the ugliest baby in the world?
Yes, father.
that's when you decided to turn his cow.
poor so-so is bitter because your "cow" outranks him now.
why didn't you let her die?
she meant nothing to you.
but she meant everything to you.
if that's all I could salvage from my wayward son
the woman he defied his maker for
I wanted someone to remember you by.
what the hell do you know about the value of life?
you're a vampire.
Yep.
and I think we both know which of our kinds kills more humans.
well, statistically speaking, that'd be your
Yes, thank you, Cass.
I get it.
you're worried what I might do if we make it topside.
I'll start eating your little piggies.
I already told you, man -- by the time I got iced,
I was strictly on blood transfusions, donated blood.
not donated to me, I'll give you that, but I paid good black-market scratch for it.
so, what is that? Like the vampire zone diet?
look, all I'm saying is I started seeing something in humanity, okay?
something that shouldn't be taken.
I drink blood. I don't drink people.
and why the hell should I believe you?
what does it matter what you believe?
you got your head so far up your ass, Dean, you don't even realize we're already done for.
the angel knows it.
do I need to remind you of our deal?
of what you committed to?
he is gonna get us killed.
we may get to test that theory.
more monsters? - Leviathan.
why don't you blip out of here?
they're too close. I can't.
run.
no, no, no. Dog, dog, dog!
Oh, no, dog, don't bother the...angry lady.
uh, hey, sorry.
dog"? That's what you're calling him?
uh...
well, it's accurate.
is dog taking his antibiotics?
uh, yes, he is.
he's doing much better. Thank you.
you know, um, I have to say -- um...
I've seen a lot of stitches in my time, and you've got really good hands.
thank you.
so, you think I'm creepy?
I think it's creepy you buy all your clothing at army surplus.
white supremacists do that. - Yeah, but I'm not.
drifting serial killers do that. Fair enough.
you come from nowhere, you appear to be going nowhere, and you've "seen a lot of stitches.
it's all pretty solid creepy.
you have no idea where you're going, either, do you?
no.
not really.
and that's because you have no one.
I mean, at all, right?
I mean, that's why you're... here in this place.
I used to -- have someone, I mean.
but that's over now.
it's gone.
you know what that's like, don't you?
this is Dean's other, other
I suppose you coming back from the dead
well, that's the definition of mutiny, isn't it?
all of this has me feeling so...tired.
you should have let me go.
but, Benny, I don't let things go.
Really?
you lived so long, how is it you have so little, hmm?
nothing but a beat-up old harpsichord and nest of hyenas.
I have the sea.
and I have Andrea. - No.
you don't have her.
at least that much I know.
Oh, that dumb bitch.
when the hell did you learn to fight like that?
I've had a lot of practice.
you just gonna sit there? -You're right.
I've been here so, so long, Benny, seen all the outcomes, all the patterns a trillion times.
it all means so little.
this universe is a pyramid of despair, nothing else.
a little dark.
I am evil, after all.
at least I've had that much to keep me cold at night.
you never had that, did you?
everything had to be thought about, considered.
you know what Socrates said about a life unconsidered.
Yes.
but what we have in us?
Benny, that's not life.
that's what you still don't get.
that's why it's always been so hard for you, my poor Benjamin.
get up.
this is the one last thing I can take from you.
no.
you try, damn it. You try and kill me again.
this is my story, you gnat.
get up! It ends the way I choose, not you.
well, at least I can finally show you something new, old man.
a whole new world.
the old man is dead.
let's go.
where, Benny?
what are you talking about?
anywhere.
you're not leaving here, are you?
and you never were.
we have everything we need right here.
the operation is still perfect.
we can ride the high seas, plunder together.
we can have the life we always wanted.
what I wanted was to leave a burning crater behind.
I wanted to put your memory to rest.
but I'm not a memory.
Benny, I'm right here.
what I loved
it ain't here anymore.
it was snuffed out a long time ago by monsters like me...
like what you've become.
you think you're better than me now?
no.
I think we're all damned.
why'd you do it, Dean?
do what?
resurrect me.
you could have drained my soul into any culvert, and no one would have been the wiser.
what the hell are you talking about?
Hey, you good?
man... I don't know what I am.
Oh, great.
I'm Benny.
heard a lot about you, Sam.
I can see you two have a lot to talk about.
then
Abaddon. She's a demon...
who, it turns out, is a knight of hell.
knights of Hell are handpicked by Lucifer himself.
I am your king.
about that...
right now you and I are gonna talk about regime change.
how do I stop?
just let it go.
we will figure it out.
Sammy's hurt. He's hurt real bad.
this one goes out to any angel with their ears on.
this is Dean Winchester...And I need your help.
easy there, brother.
I heard your prayer, and I am here to help.
you want to help? Start with a name.
no, we had a deal. I fight. You save.
there is a chance I can fix your brother from the inside.
how will it work? -I heal Sam while healing myself.
and when he's healed?
I leave.
he's gonna wake up, right? -He will.
so, what he does -- what, is he gonna feel you inside, triaging his spleen?
he will not feel me, no.
there is no reason for him to know I'm in here at all.
without his acceptance, Sam can eject me at any time.
and if Sam does eject me, he will die.
then we keep it a secret for now.
now
so, what, Cass is human?
I mean, he's got no Grace, no wings, no...harp, whatever the hell else he had.
okay.
Where'd he crash-land?
called me from a pay phone from Longmont, Colorado.
I told him just to make for the bunker.
well, you think he can handle a road trip like that?
well, Cass is a big boy.
things go breaking bad, he knows our number.
right now, I got bigger worries.
what do you think they're gonna do?
I got no damn clue.
what about Crowley?
you, uh...
but then I thought to myself,"what would Sam Winchester do?"
I'd have stabbed him in the brain.
well, I figured the King of Hell might know a few things, so why not "Zero Dark Thirty" his ass?
wait.
so, Crowley is alive?
he's the junk in my trunk.
what the hell?
you're alive.
Yeah, 'cause you're a crappy shot...
Katniss.
sorry.
it's been a bad couple of days.
I-I haven't slept or eaten.
I'm pretty backed up.
okay, over-share.
after we talked, this place went nuts, all right?
there was some alarm, and all the machines were freaking out.
and the bunker just locked down.
I couldn't open the door. My cellphone stopped working.
I thought the world was ending.
close.
the Angels fell.
what does that mean?
I got service.
it's back online.
Yeah, okay. Let's go with that.
Hey. All good?
is it ever. Come on.
no.
hello.
Ah. Never get tired of doing that.
homey.
where did you get this fantastic little tree house?
all right, here's how it's gonna go.
you're giving us the name of every demon on Earth and the people they're possessing.
am I?
doesn't sound like me.
I saw you break down, Crowley.
when I was trying to cure you,
I know a part of you was human again, maybe still is.
blah-blah. Boo-hoo. Done?
good.'cause this is what I know.
I'm not giving you anything.
why would I?
you have no leverage, darlings.
you're not gonna close the Gates of Hell because you didn't.
you're not gonna kill me because you haven't.
so, what's left?
we have a few ideas.
torture? Brilliant.
can't wait to see Sam in stilettos and a leather bustier really putting the S-A-M into S-and-M.
honestly, boys, what are you gonna do to me that I don't do to myself just for kicks every Friday night?
have fun.
what's Crowley doing here? Why isn't he dead?!
why aren't you stabbing him right now?!
all right, all right. Chill out, Kevin, okay?
we need him. -What?
Kevin, look, if we can get Crowley to give us the name of every demon he's got topside, we can hunt them down --all of them.
he will break, okay?
and when he does, we'll hold him down while you knife him.
then we all go out for ice cream and strippers.
just stay away from him, all right?
so, now what? -I got to make some phone calls.
you need to hit the Angel tablet,
Yeah, maybe we can reverse it before the God squad does too much damage.
Yeah, if we're lucky.
all right. Check the net for anything angel-y.
or demon-y.
or monster-y or ghost-y or
it's gonna be a busy year.
my name is Abaddon.
but enough about me.
let's talk you.
Jason tells me you're all violent, power-hungry opportunists.
so, maybe you can tell me
and demons. I mean...
you call that a meat suit?
I closed 72 deals last year.
kids love grandma.
and that's the problem.
deals.
we're paying for what we should be taking.
who put Crowley in charge?
what's the matter? Hellhound got your tongue?
you took orders from him!
he's the King.
he's a salesman.
a king fights.
a king conquers.
a king does more than sit around reading contracts.
but the King's dead.
long live the Queen.
I can get you new bodies.
and we will march into Hell, where we will be greeted as liberators, and demonkind will rise up and sweep over the Earth.
and all the humans and all the Angels, with their clipped wings, will bow to me, or they will burn.
what about Crowley?
Crowley's dead.
well, uh, n-no offense, honey, but we all thought you were dead until, like, a week ago.
and what if Crowley does come back?
look, a lot of us were scared of him.
a lot of us still are.
prove that Crowley's really gone, and then maybe this scheme of yours will work.
or not.
honestly, I always thought you Knights were overrated.
you go to hell, and you tell them I'm coming.
Yeah, Irv. Fallen Angels.
huh. That's a wrinkle.
well, trust me, they're just monsters with good P. R.
so, if you run into one, torch his ass with holy oil.
Oh, and if they drop, uh, like, a silver sword, grab it.
those pig-stickers come in handy.
okay. Criminy.
Hey, look, I know this is weird, but
hell, Dean-o, weird's what we do.
I remember this case me and Bobby worked up in Saskatoon.
had these two --the werewolf siamese twins.
he told you about that?
every time he drank Labatt's.
so, if you run into any problems, give a call, okay?
and, uh, spread the word.
the more hunters that know, the better. -Roger-Dodger.
so, this is your first weekend pass into town, right?
so, I set it all up.
Jamie's waiting at the bar and has a thing...
so, you just start buying shots, then you can thank me in the morning.
cool.
now, that is more like it.
need some help?
um, yeah. I-I-I-I don't know.
I...think the thingy broke.
well, I could give you a lift into town.
that would be amazing.
Thanks.
nice hunting.
Oh, God.
this place reeks of sulfur.
between the stink, with the freak thunderstorms, and every cow dead within three miles,
I'll take demons for $1, 000, Alex.
Hey. Agents Stark and Banner, FBI.
just need to have a look around.
Why? This is a military case, not a federal one.
well, that's not what our supervisor said.
that so?
then maybe him and I ought to have a chat.
okay.
Hey.
Hey, boss. Uh, we got a little problem here.
"Boss"?
Yeah, just a local badge needs confirmation we're supposed to be here...
how the word came down from FBI headquarters in D. C.
wait, w-what? -Yeah.
who am I talking to?
uh, Kevin...Solo.
how old are you?
old enough.
and I'm with the FBI, so you have to do what I say or
listen, kid.
I don't have to do anything, and I don't take orders from the Feeb, so unless you can give me one good reason you got a couple of pretty-boy agents poking around my crime scene,
I'm gonna put them in cuffs and spank your ass raw.
understand?
Cabo last June.
what?
that's my reason.
Oh, my favorite's you in a sombrero doing a body shot off some naked guy in a Luchador mask.
Super-classy.
how did you find that?
cause I'm Kevin frigging Solo.
so, unless you want this forwarded to your commanding officer, Major Velasquez,
I suggest you give my guys anything they want.
you understand?
Yes.
Yes...Sir.
Yes, sir.
what the hell did you just do?
And?
I hacked it.
Hey, Kevin.
good job, buddy.
Hey. Anything?
Yeah, this guy was shot in the heart.
that what killed him?
maybe --15, 20 years ago.
every one of these bodies has a fatal wound or two or three, but they're all old.
so, we're looking at meatsuits?
the bodies took a licking, and the demon inside kept them ticking.
probably.
I think they were possessed, and now those soldiers are.
Hey.
excuse me, agents.
we pulled this off a security camera.
you might want to take a look.
Abaddon? Seriously?
thought you Kentucky fried that meatsuit.
I did, Dean.
you -- well, then, how did she get it back?
thank you.
and why's she playing G. I. Joe?
no clue. Why don't you ask her when we find her?
Oh, I will. Then I'm gonna chop her freakin' head off -- again.
all right, Pete.
the Winchesters --where are they?
bite me.
I said where are the Winchesters?
and I said bite me, crew cut.
let me show you how it's done, boys.
help me! Help!
you can scream all you want to.
now, let's talk Sam and Dean.
Hello?
this is Dean's number, but you're not a Winchester.
who are you?
I'm nobody.
well, nobody...
I need you to give those boys a message for me.
I have something they might want.
Kevin, wait. Wait. Wait. Slow down.
she gave me these coordinates --44. 053051 by -123. 127860
and two names, Irv Franklin and Tracy Bell.
Irv's a friend. Don't know Tracy.
all right, the lady said they were hunters and that if you didn't go save them, that she would kill them.
Yeah, I've heard that song before.
Dean, who was she?
she's the bad guy.
all right, new job.
dig up everything men of letters have on Knights of Hell.
knights of Hell? Sure.
you find a way to kill one
I mean permanently --drop a dime.
Thanks, Kevin.
the numbers point to a spot on the outskirts of Eugene, Oregon.
you know this is a trap, right?
Yep.
and we're just gonna walk right into it?
guns blazing.
you with me?
you know it.
you're the third trial, Crowley.
where do I start...
you're our bitch.
to even lookfor forgiveness?
your demon ass is going to be a mortal asspretty damn quick.
none of thismeans anything to you?
you're my Marnie, moose.
and Hannah -- she just --she needs to be loved.
she deserves it.
we deserve to be loved.
I deserve to be loved!
I just want to be loved.
I just want to be loved.
Kevin, I know it's you.
I'd recognize the pitter-patter of those little feet anywhere.
that's right.
run.
it's what you do.
you're
what's the word?
weak.
Hiya, Kev.
the hell happened here?
a local chemical plant sprung a leak years ago.
they evacuated three square blocks.
guess it's still contaminated.
wait, so this whole place is poison?
Yeah.
that's not gonna help.
Irv? Hey.
Where's Abaddon?
Abaddon's been torturing hunters.
she's trying to get intel on you boys.
now, do you want to make with the rescue or what?
right after you take a shot of holy water, huh?
happy?
sorry about that. - Don't worry about it.
last thing you need is us popping black eyes.
you're Tracy, right? I'm Sam Winchester.
good for you.
she's new.
we did a shifter job in Sacramento together.
smart, but got a mouth on her.
let's gear up.
so, what brings you to my boudoir, handsome?
you're gonna tell me how to kill a Knight of Hell.
Abaddon giving you trouble, eh?
tell you what.
you let me go, and I'll spit roast the little whore for you.
sound good?
you're bluffing.
you don't know.
Oh, I know plenty.
for example, I know she'd love you
skinny, submissive.
you're just her type.
shut up.
fine.
that's not what you came for anyway -- not really.
what's on your mind, Kevin?
you can tell me.
we're friends.
you tortured me.
I torture all my friends.
it's how I show love.
I was raised in a dysfunctional home environment.
you killed my mom!
did I?
I mean, are you sure?
did you ever see a body?
I mean, how could you be sure she's dead?
that's right.
let it all out.
all right, we got Jesus juice, guns loaded with Devil's Trap bullets.
shoot a demon, put him on lockdown.
the angel blade works.
they're coming.
good.
they've got assault rifles.
okay, less good.
so, what's the play?
come and get it, you dicks!
come and get it, you dicks!
come and get it, you dicks!
damn it.
all right.
we got to flank SEAL team douche in there, so, uh,
Irv, you and me will go left.
Sam, you and Tracy go right.
okay. Let's move.
don't touch me.
whoa. What's the problem?
my family's dead because of him.
I watched a demon slaughter my parents, and the whole time, it talked about how it was celebrating.
how some dumb kid let Lucifer out of his cage.
okay, all right, we got to move.
uh, girl's with me. Irv.
okay. Let's go, son.
now that you've felt your feels, maybe we can talk.
I'm gonna make this simple, Kevin.
let me go...
and I'll give you back your mother.
she's dead.
Oh, she wishes she was.
after what I had my heavies do to her, she's begging for it.
but when have you ever known me to let anyone off easy?
you think Sam and Dean care about her? Huh?
you think they care about you?
you're just here to serve their needs.
nothing more.
it's just a matter of time.
when the Winchesters are done with you, they'll toss you aside without a second thought because they can.
because they think they're special.
and because, well...
there's always another Prophet waiting in the wings.
I'm the one in chains, but...
we're both prisoners here.
what say you let me go and we walk out those doors together?
what say we both win?
okay, I think they're still inside.
we wait till they come out, and we pick them off one by one.
and watched it all go to crap.
okay? That's just part of being a hunter.
being human.
look, you want to be pissed off at Sam, that's fine. I get it.
but if you want to go after somebody, you make sure that they got black eyes.
got to know who the real monsters are in this world, kid.
Sam, you copacetic?
good.
now hand me that toothpick and you and Dean and Tracy --you beat feet out of here.
what? -I'm going in there alone.
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
Irv, that's death.
Yeah, well, it's what I got coming.
it's my fault, Sam.
and I met some girl, and the next thing you know,
I'm strapped to some bed and she's twisting things that ain't supposed to be twisted.
"she" who?
Abaddon.
I gave 'em up.
Pete, Tracy --I gave 'em all up.
so you hand me that blade and you let me do what I got to do, or so help me
boo.
nice grouping.
Kevlar. Beats magic bullets.
I love the future.
listen, my car is three blocks over.
go get more bullets, more holy water -- get everything.
no, no, b-but what about you? Just go! Go! Now!
alone at last.
cool. I didn't miss the best part.
I think that's what I like most about you Winchesters.
you're so obedient.
and suicidally stupid.
I like that, too.
are we gonna fight or make out?
cause I'm getting some real mixed signals here.
I want Crowley --or what's left of him.
yeah? What's in it for me?
I let you die.
you give me Crowley's head, and I will snap your neck quick and clean.
you won't feel a thing, trust me.
and if I tell you to get bent?
Oh.
well...
you know, I've loved this body since the moment I first saw it.
you're the perfect vessel, Dean.
you give a girl all sorts of nasty ideas.
so go ahead and play hard to get, and I'll peel off this "no demons allowed" tattoo and blow smoke up your ass.
well, I got to tell you, between you and me, it is a horror show up there.
it can get worse.
trust me.
cause once I'm on top, I'll make you watch.
and I'll use your body.
have you ever felt an infant's blood drip down your chin?
or listen to a girl scream as you rip her guts out?
because you will.
you and me, lover.
and we'll have a grand old time.
an Angel?
what, you think we'd roll up to this mouse trap without some backup?
they were going to kill him, Dean.
what the hell did you do?
I was protecting your brother.
I thought that was what you wanted.
Yeah.
right, yeah, no, I-I --sorry.
I'm just still getting used to this whole thing.
as am I.
but Sam's okay?
he was knocked unconscious.
in a way, he still is.
Sam will not remember any of this.
so what the hell am I supposed to tell him when he comes to?
that was why I used the knife.
right.
smart.
you are troubled still.
Yeah, it's just that, uh...
Yeah, this is on me.
I was the one who talked Sam out of boarding up hell.
okay, so every demon deal, every -- every kill that they make, well, you're looking at the person who let it happen.
you were protecting your brother.
I am in Sam's head.
everything he knows, I know.
and I know that what you did, you did out of love.
Yeah.
uh, look, Zeke --I'm gonna call you Zeke
I'm not really with the whole, uh, love and...love.
but it is why I said yes.
Yeah, and if that goes sideways, that's on me, too.
that is not going to happen.
this is nuts.
I mean, you're Sam, but you're not Sam, and normally he's the one I'm talking to about all this stuff.
I'm trusting you, Zeke.
I just got to hope that you're one of the good guys.
but I suppose that is what a bad guy would say.
Dean Winchester, you are doing the right thing.
Dean? What the hell happened?
you took a shot to the head, and I came in and saved your ass, like usual.
you killed three demons?
alone?
I took them by surprise.
got a little messy. I got a little lucky.
Oh, and, uh...
I'm awesome, so there's that.
geez.
Yeah.
Whew. You are pretty damn awesome.
Hey. You okay?
Yeah. You?
more or less, yeah.
good.
I got everything, but guess I'm late to the party.
lucky you.
let's blow this toxic waste dump.
burgers and silkwood showers on me.
who worked you over?
martin Hayward and Brandon Favors.
they did this to you?
no. They're demons.
you asked for names, I'm giving you names.
they're underperformers.
spike them, you're doing me a favor.
Wow. You break easy.
please.
your little plan to have me stew in my own delicious juices
pathetic.
you want intel.
I want things, too.
maybe we can come to some kind of arrangement.
gentlemen.
so, these are what, then? Freebies?
not at all.
you can consider them fair trade for the enjoyment that Kevin gave me.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
he's my new favorite toy.
wind him up, watch him go.
you check the names. I'll go find the kid.
where do you think you're going?
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey!
whoa, whoa. Talk to me.
you can't keep me locked in here. I'm leaving.
like hell.
man, we told you not to talk to Crowley, okay?
he messes with your head.
he said my mom's alive.
and you believed him?
he's still in there, isn't he?
Crowley's lying.
and if he's not?
if she is alive, then she's dead.
in every way that matters, she's dead, Kevin.
I'm sorry.
I know you're dying to bolt, man.
I get it.
but out that door, it's demons and it's angels, and they would all love to get their hands on a Prophet, so even with Crowley here, this is still the safest place for you.
it just is.
and we need you, man.
cause I'm useful.
because you're family.
after all the crap we've been through, after all the good that you've done...
man, if you don't think that we would die for you...
I don't know what to tell you.
because you, me, Sam, and Cass
we are all we've got.
but, hey, if none of that matters to you, then I won't stop you.
Kevin's passed out in one of the back rooms.
he'll bounce back.
what's up with you?
nothing.
it's just...
what Tracy said about me
she wasn't wrong.
Sam, listen to me.
you have helped a hell of a lot more people than you have hurt.
so all of that --that was then.
okay?
here's to now.
so, you ready for it?
hmm?
the Fallen Angels?
Abaddon?
cass losing his halo?
Crowley in our basement?
crap. We're living in a freakin' sitcom.
what about you?
how's the, uh, the engine running?
honestly, um...I feel better than I have in a long time.
I mean, I realize it's crazy out there and we have trouble coming for us, but I look around and I see friends and family.
I am happy with my life for the first time in...
forever.
I-I am. I really am.
I-it's just things are...
things are good.
never better.
Cody.
there you are, girl.
how did you find me? - Come on.
you don't really need to ask that, do you?
a-are the others with you?
everyone was off on a hunt when I'd realized you'd run away.
figured I'd do you and them a favor and come take care of this before they even know we're gone.
you can't get me in here.
cop sure was in a hurry to check out that "b&e" I faked.
barely even saw me coming.
I keep telling you...
you can run and you can hide, but we will always find you.
you boys are a sight.
Jody.
how's the shoulder?
eh, only aches when it rains.
how you boys been?
peachy. - Touch and go.
I know the feeling.
so, what you got for us?
Yeah, uh, that's a vamp, all right.
I don't know, Sammy.
looks like Jody might not need our help anymore.
Oh, they grow up too fast. - Don't they?
Yeah, joke all you want.
there's more where this came from.
more?
my men brought in a runaway last night.
there's no I. D. On her... nothing on her, actually, except for a bus ticket out of Nebraska.
total Jane Doe. She won't even give me her name.
girl's basically feral.
she's got zero manners, didn't even thank me for saving her.
anyhow, this thing went to plenty of trouble to get at her.
and to hear him tell it, the "others" will want her at least as bad as he did.
sounds like a nest. - Yeah.
nest?
I'm guessing that's not half as cute and cozy as it sounds.
Oh, I'm afraid not.
Wilson and Fisher?
you two are FBI, then I'm Taylor Swift.
that wasn't a dental I. D.
it was a fang check. You're hunters.
and you're alive because, uh, hunters trained the sheriff.
I think the first words out of your mouth should be a thank you.
so, who were you to this vamp, anyway?
what's so special about you?
is there a nest?
sorry to interrupt. We got a match on her DNA.
Annie Jones.
reported abducted outside of Kenosha in '06.
raised by an elderly grandparent.
no living kin.
you think the vamps are the ones who took her?
eight years is a long time for a human to live with vampires without getting killed or turned.
you're the experts, but there was something...
familiar about the way this vamp talked to her.
Jody's right.
and she had scars on her neck, feeding scars.
they're layered, as if they'd been built on for years.
so she's a blood slave.
we've seen it before...
vampires keeping people as pets, human feedbags.
sometimes these slaves...
stay loyal to their captors.
Yeah. - Right.
so...this girl's not talking 'cause she's got a case of...what?
vampiric stockholm syndrome?
she's protecting the nest.
so, you feel a debt.
they gave you a home, raised you.
Annie, we get it.
loyalty is a very powerful thing.
my name is Alex. - No, it's not.
your name is Annie Jones.
those vampires stole you.
they're monsters, Annie.
Alex. - And they didn't love you.
they loved your blood.
they fed on you.
I fed them.
my choice.
my brothers... They brought me food when I was hungry.
so when they struck out on a hunt, I fed them.
they're my family.
okay, you care about them, but, Alex...
there's a reason you decided to run away.
it was time...
to move on and get out on my own.
and how do you think that decision is gonna sit with the rest of the nest?
one of them already pursued you.
you think when the rest of them find out that you left that they're just gonna shrug and cut their losses?
you lived with them for years.
they've tasted your blood.
they have your scent down cold.
I mean, how far can you run and for how long?
you didn't think this out, did you?
what would happen, who might get hurt...
your, uh, "brother," for one.
his name's Cody.
and she killed him.
because of a choice you made.
these are the consequences.
you got two options... them or you.
and we can help you. We can keep you safe.
but you have to help us.
Where's the nest?
I can't.
after what's happened...
...mama finds me, she'll kill me.
mills, you okay?
no wonder she didn't thank me.
that creep was her brother.
I'm fine.
you know, mostly, I'm just... I'm hung up on the name.
Alex and Annie... they're so close already.
why'd they change it?
okay, so, we know from her ticket that Alex hopped a bus out of O'Neill, Nebraska, right?
obviously, it'd be better to go in with a firm location, but the town ain't that big.
there are no caves or other natural hiding places.
all right, so go in, canvass it cold.
well, I worked together a short list of possible nest locations.
uh, there's an empty fire station, four or five derelict homes.
nothing we couldn't hit in a day.
okay.
you sure you're all right to babysit by yourself?
Oh, well, girl's a flight risk, not exactly friendly, but I think I can handle babysitting detail.
the station's been made.
it might be worth heading upwind for a while.
I mean, vamps are trackers.
terrific. - Yeah.
well, I've got an old family cabin outside of town.
that'll work. - Okay.
well, shouldn't raise too many eyebrows, me being gone for a day.
maybe, but you, uh, sure you don't want backup?
you want me to enlist my men in a protection detail against vampires?
Frank's still in the dark about what hit him last night.
the guy still has nightmares about the barn episode of "walking dead
they're good cops.
they're not ready for this.
Jody, in your late-night reading, did you ever come across anything about dead man's blood?
it takes vamps down like a horse tranq.
I would not say no to some of that.
I mean, not that I'll need it.
you guys are gonna get the jump on these vamps and be back here before they even realize their kin's missing, right?
well, it's not my fault.
well, Ralph didn't show up for work today.
I had to pull a double shift.
I'll be home soon.
Connor, you scared the...
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snuck up on you like that.
it's just, you haven't seen Alex around, have you?
uh, your sister. No, I can't say I have. Sorry.
so you didn't sell her a bus ticket out of town?
did I help your shut-in kid sister get away from her weird, scary-ass squatter family?
answer's still "no
so you're saying Ralph lied to us?
cause he said...that you sold her a ticket...
...right before we killed him.
you calling my family weird?
Oh, honey, you have no idea.
what? Too rustic for your taste?
well, I have a lot of great memories.
used to come up here all the time...
first as a kid with my parents and then with my...
anyhow, it's a lot nicer than it looks from the outside.
F. Y.I... the woods around here...
really easy to get lost in if you don't know your way around.
me...
I know them like the back of my hand.
I got it.
don't try running. You won't get far
you know this doesn't work, right?
on vampires? It's useless.
that's not why I have it.
this your family?
Yes.
where are they?
Oh. Dead.
you know, there are about a thousand more polite ways you could say that.
I'll give you a pass on account of the whole raised-by-monsters thing.
how'd they die?
horribly.
you must be exhausted.
I know for a fact you didn't sleep last night.
I'm fine.
it's no problem. I can make up a bed.
I'm fine.
suit yourself.
this place is a foreclosure, right?
Yep.
it is, just like the rest of them.
well, somebody's squatting here.
blackout windows.
Hey, you need a hand with that?
I guess not.
you go out with the family, bring home a nice dinner.
how did you get stuck doing the dishes?
we all have our roles to play.
yours being destroying the evidence, yeah?
nice job.
Ralph Hedges. Stacy Kepler.
any reason you targeted them?
Yeah. Hunger.
and, so, the family's what?
out taking a nice after-dinner stroll?
Oh, I'm sure they'll be back real soon.
what I asked was...
where are they?
nice shiner.
can I help you all with something?
as a matter of fact...
I think you can.
you don't want to talk.
no skin off my back.
cause you see, a blood-sucking, body-chipping vamp...
that's bad enough, but vamps...
that kidnap kids...
well, I'm going to enjoy putting you down.
of course.
Oh, I knew this was about Alexis.
I warned mama that girl would screw everything up for us one day.
Mama"?
as in one vamp turned you all?
well, all of us but little sis.
she was, uh, "Too good to turn
mama couldn't bring herself to, no matter what we said, no matter how bad Alexis got.
bad?
let me guess. You never had a teenage sister.
dragging her heels, whining, near constant, about everything, but more and more about the blood, like she's somehow above it, like she's better than us 'cause she don't feed on people.
she is better than you, dumbass.
her moping?
that teenage crisis-of-conscience crap?
it's annoying as hell, but it's just an act.
when the chips are down, she'll always choose us over humans.
I mean, how do you think we stayed off your radar all these years?
pretty, young, lost-looking thing like her?
irresistible, especially to the kind of man few people would miss.
I mean, sure, we hunt sometimes for sport, but it's a lot easier and a lot safer to get delivery.
come on, sweetie.
aren't you gonna give me a name?
it's... Ann.
Mm. Sweet Ann.
you got any idea what I'm about to do to you?
Yeah. I do.
nothing.
what the...
is this a party?
she's your lure.
best a vamp could ask for.
and you better believe you don't get that good at it unless you enjoy it.
in her own sweet way...
girl's as bloodthirsty as any vampire.
Jody.
Alex?
Alex?
Alex!
easy.
sorry.
sorry.
I made you a sandwich. It's out there if you want it.
sheriff.
my grandma?
I'm so sorry.
no, it's... it's fine.
I figured... it's been years, and she was old.
you got it. Thank you.
she's not answering.
I just ran the victims' names through local P. D.
they both worked at the O'Neill bus station.
so they killed them for Alex's location.
Jody?
Dean, what's up?
listen to me.
the vamps knew that Alex went to Sioux Falls, okay?
they're probably already there.
we're on our way there next.
but there's something else. There's something about Alex.
it can wait.
they're here.
what?
at the cabin. Now.
we're on our way. - Hurry.
she hung up.
we moving?
Yeah. Meet you outside.
Alex?
Alex, come on. We got to go.
we got to go.
Jody, help!
Alex?!
Alex!
Alex!
help me! Help!
let me go!
come on, let's go!
move it!
Jody?
Hey, you okay?
Where's Alex?
you tell us.
they came and I tried to stop them.
and you got knocked out.
well, happens to the best of us.
just lucky you're alive.
you think they went back to the nest?
of course they did. Why wouldn't they?
question is -- what are they gonna do when they find their brother dead?
so we go back now.
okay. I'm coming.
uh, Jody?
hold on. You're hurt.
I'm coming.
Jody, we can handle the nest on our own.
I don't give a fig about the nest.
that girl was under my protection.
okay, that "girl" can't be trusted. She's a lure.
she's a-a honey trap.
she's been feeding people to those vamps!
I don't care. Whatever she did, she did because they made her.
Oh, and that's a reason? - She's a kid!
Yeah, a kid who's been playing vampire murder since before she was in braces.
Jody, he's right.
a-at best, her loyalties are... Screwed.
and how do you even know she wants to be saved?
for the past eight years, she has been baiting the hook for an entire nest.
she's got more blood on her hands than most monsters we kill.
are you saying she's on your list?
no, we're not saying that. - Well, not yet.
look, it sucks, okay? It does.
but with hunting monsters comes harsh truths.
this is a clean-up mission.
it's not a rescue.
what is this even really about?
you barely know the girl.
I'm coming.
and if either one of you lays so much as a hand on Alex...
you'll have to go through me.
put up quite a struggle with Connor.
says you nearly took his eye out.
maybe that was just his excuse for knocking you out.
you have any idea the mess you made?
hunters raided the place while we were out, tortured and killed Dale.
our home's been made.
we're gonna have to move again.
mama, I-I never meant
we will all find our way.
things got screwy...
but you're back now.
Why?
after everything, I thought that you
you thought what?
that I'd hurt you? Kill you?
I would never hurt you.
not my baby girl, not my sweet Alex.
how could you even think that?
baby, why did you do it? Why did you run from us?
I love you, mama.
I do. I just
I couldn't take it anymore.
the blood and the death, the sounds of their screams.
I just... I can't do it anymore.
and the way I feel afterwards, the guilt...
I'd rather die than feel that way again.
it's my fault.
what?
all of it. This is my fault.
I should've turned you years ago.
well, their truck's in the driveway.
so we're walking right into it.
well, we've faced worse odds.
Jody.
this is a raid, so tread lightly, stay close.
priority is clearing the nest.
Alex comes second. You got it?
got it.
it was so selfish.
I wanted to watch you grow up.
I kept putting it off. Don't you see?
these things you've been feeling
all the guilt and suffering -- those are human feelings.
it ain't too late. I can take the pain away.
and then we can stay together, as a family.
like none of this ever happened.
wouldn't you like that?
drop it.
Alex, come on. Come on, honey. We got to go.
go away!
we got to go!
what did they do to you?
I'm sorry, Jody.
I made my choice.
she chose me.
no, no, no. No.
hell of a sight to come home to...
brother lying dead on the floor.
no idea it was a Winchester that had done it.
So...Which one of you was it?
which one of you took off my brother's head?!
was it you?
was it him?
pretty fitting
brother for a brother.
this place has been a good home to us.
but since you two had to come around and ruin it, we're gonna have to to hit the road and find a new one.
and when we hit the road...
we like to pack a lunch.
can't say you didn't come prepared.
Alex.
don't be bothering my girl.
she's going through something, a process.
what did you do to her?
fed her my blood.
she's on her way now.
all that's left is to feed.
please, mama.
let her go.
I already drank from you.
let her go.
made an impression on my girl, I see.
baby, this is the human half of you talking.
after the change, this human -- she ain't nothing to you.
clearly, Sheriff, you got issues, some hole in your life you're using my Alex to fill.
I would say go and get a family of your own, but, well...you know.
that's pretty rich coming from the woman who stole Alex to begin with.
I have fed her, clothed her, loved her going on nine years.
you think motherhood's just about blood?
you don't know the first thing about it.
maybe not, but I know what it isn't.
and it ain't about forcing her to be like you the second she becomes inconvenient.
don't you see what she is trying to do?
this hunter cop bitch is trying to turn you against me to save her own hide.
don't believe a word she says.
she ain't your mother.
tapped this keg. Get the short-hair one ready.
time to finish this.
Alex!
was that her name?
you named her after someone.
was it your daughter?
I couldn't figure out why you changed her name.
I thought maybe you were ashamed of your theft, but you have no shame.
you said that I was using her to fill a hole in my life, and you're right. I am.
you are, too.
mama?
I guess it takes one to know one.
that Alex...
she died a long time ago.
and it still hurts.
you still feel it, the loss, the pain
like a stone in your gut.
it hurts just a little bit less whenever she's near.
you bitch.
look at me.
look at me, bitch!
Dean.
Yeah, I know.
you wouldn't have done the same for me.
no. Jody.
good news, lady cop.
whoever you lost...
you're gonna see them again real soon.
Alex?
how could you?
you were my girl.
I'm sorry, mama.
don't watch this, sweetheart.
nice work back there.
look at me, bitch"?
well, hey, you got another snappy one-liner, I'm all ears.
what I'm saying is
it looked to me like you were enjoying it.
maybe too much.
And?
well, sorry for not putting on a hair shirt.
killing things that need killing is kind of our job.
last I checked, taking pleasure in that is not a crime.
right, but...
how's things back at the station?
well, they beat Frank up pretty bad, but at least they left him alive.
he kept apologizing for spilling the beans about the cabin, but I told him that one's on me.
well, speaking of apologies, um... we owe you a big one.
we were wrong about the girl.
no. You were right -- about me.
my judgment was clouded.
you know, working this case, it brought... feelings back.
feelings I've been trying to bury for years, you know, buried it under work, religion... even dating.
we know how that worked out.
but, you know, it was still there, you know, underneath.
the grief.
don't know what that means for me, just that I've been
I've been fooling myself to think that I could ignore it.
anyway, thank you
for coming out, for curing Alex.
you don't need to thank us.
I mean, you're the one who killed her sire, got her blood.
sure it'll work?
well, speaking from experience, it'll be a rough couple of days, but...
she should pull through.
you sure you don't want us to stay?
I'm good.
after it's done, you know what to do with her?
don't get up on account of me.
I'm -- I'm hot.
should I grab a
I'll just be cold again in a second.
it's part of the cure, I guess.
you want something to eat?
no, I'll just throw it up.
but, uh, thank you.
I want you to know that...
when mama offered, I just...
I couldn't disappoint her again.
I had enough to be ashamed of as it is.
Jody, I-I've done things.
you don't have to explain. I know.
whatever you want from me, I'll give it.
if you want, I'm here.
but what you've been through the last 48 alone, losing your entire family, everything you've ever known or loved
no one can understand that.
you can.
they have volunteered to be marooned for 39 days on mysterious Borneo.
this is their story.
this is Survivor.
are we getting two of these?
Where's that box?
Jeff: You are witnessing 16 Americans begin an adventure that will forever change their lives.
they've been given two minutes to salvage whatever they can off this boat.
their destination: this island right here, a beautiful, but dangerous jungle in the middle in the South China Sea.
who's got oars?!
Oh, we got our lifejackets.
for the next 39 days, they'll be marooned, left to fend for themselves, no creature comforts.
they are wiping the slate clean.
grab it!
16 strangers forced to band together to carve out a new existence, totally accountable for their actions.
they must learn to adapt, or they're voted off.
in the end, only one will remain and will leave the island with $1 million in cash as their reward.
go, go, go!
39 days, 16 people, one survivor.
grab it! Hey, behind you!
get off the raft!
get off the other side!
get off the raft!
the rod, Sean!
listen up!
grab your backpacks!
put them on!
go! Let's do it!
Whoo!
here we go!
Whoo!
the 16 contestants have been separated into two tribes named after the beaches where they will live.
the Tagi Tribe, who will always wear orange, consists of: Sean Kenniff a neurologist from Long Island;
Kelly Wiglesworth, a river guide from Las Vegas;
Rudy Boesch, a retired Navy SEAL from Virginia;
sonja Christopher, a 63-year-old cancer survivor from San Francisco;
richard Hatch, a corporate communications consultant from Rhode Island;
Susan Hawk, a truck driver from Wisconsin;
dirk Been, a young dairy farmer, also from Wisconsin, and Stacey Stillman, a litigation attorney from San Francisco.
the Pagong Tribe, who will always wear yellow, consists of:
Gervase Peterson, a YMCA basketball coach from Philadelphia;
Colleen Haskell, an advertising student from Miami;
B. B. Andersen, a real estate developer from Kansas city;
Ramona Gray, a biochemist from New Jersey;
Gretchen Cordy, a preschool teacher from Tennessee;
Greg Buis, a recent Ivy League graduate from Colorado;
Jenna Lewis, a single mother and full-time student from new Hampshire, and Joel Klug, a health club consultant from Little Rock.
hard to imagine that just four hours ago, this group met for the first time in a small fishing village on the coast of Borneo.
their minds racing with questions, wondering, "Can I do this?
this is more than just a test of survival skills.
it's also a test of social skills.
here, it's the impressions you make on the other castaways that determines your fate.
under the rules, one tribe must visit Tribal Council every three days with a single purpose:
vote one of their own members off the island.
to win, you must survive the island, survive the vote, and, ultimately, survive each other.
Whoo!
I'm giving you a degree
a university honorary degree.
Whoo!
damn, when you guys get up, now the whole thing goes...
Whoa! Watch out!
here we go.
we got a great view of Snake Island!
get to work.
we got oars. We got buckets.
we're set for months.
Hey, who knows, we could make a mud house with it.
you know, that could be like rebar.
Rudy: Paddling over, we had two or three of those boxes in the water, dragging them behind the raft and that is dumb.
I said, "Let's get them boxes aboard."
it'll be a lot easier.
you know, That's deadweight you got.
kelly: He was yelling at everybody "Let's lose the box!"
cut it loose now!
he may be 72 years old and an ex-Navy SEAL, but that doesn't mean that this is his world.
richard: Rudy, Sean, Stacey, Sue, can we take 15 minutes and just talk before we do anything?
sure.
can we piss first?
just a suggestion.
should we take a break?
no, keep paddling!
one break at a time!
one water break at a time.
we want to get closer to the island before we turn up.
I'll distill you all the water you want, just get me to the island.
you guys, we are so close.
keep going, we're there.
you all right?
we're almost there, Roe, hang in.
okay.
got it going right over here.
straight ahead of us. Where'd he point?
right there. Straight up there.
Whoo! And we're all here.
let's go.
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
this is what I was talking about!
Ramona, how you doing, honey?
RAMONA: I don't like being on the water all that much.
so, I mean, the whole motion like this, and we're rowing, and we have like 100 pounds of stuff on the raft,
I just, I started heaving.
good job. Good job.
RAMONA: I'm used to being in a lab with my lab coat on, in the air-conditioning.
but this is, like, outdoors, 24-7, and you're exerting energy, like, almost all of that time.
Oh, my God.
this is just Day One.
should we, uh, you know, talk for a little bit, or should we start moving stuff up?
Hey, let's discuss some things, man.
let's figure some things out.
here's what we plan on doing.
high tide is that line right there, see that line?
Yeah, uh-huh.
so it shouldn't come up to here.
and this piece of bamboo back he re, we can lay it from up here, over to there, and that'll be the beginning of our shelter.
actually, before we build a shelter, just knock that whole branch off.
no, I mean, this is an awesome spot.
I'm just saying...
what's the first thing we need to do?
shelter. We need a latrine.
okay, so we don't need fire tonight?
that's an option.
we got enough water to make it tonight.
you guys, I think first thing we ought to do is talk about how we're going to do whatever we're going to do
talk about the process.
listen, listen.
let me give you a rough quick.
the camp will be right there.
we'll clear these leaves off.
that's a flat piece of ground.
the latrine will be down there.
the wind's hitting me in the back right now.
SEAN: So, we're saying we need a latrine and a clear place to sleep, is that all?
food.
and if we need more...
let's check the box, before we make any decisions.
let's see what we got.
there might be a blowtorch in there.
we need a bathroom.
are you guys all done talking?
huh?
I don't know.
I'm done.
I'm going to open up a box.
I'm looking for Fritos.
DIRK: Rich, um, I appreciate what he's trying to do as far as bring the team together and stuff, 'cause that's one thing that needs to happen.
I think he's got some good skills in that area.
and, unfortunately, people like that annoy me.
I'm just thinking,
I think we're off to a bad start.
why, 'cause we're not talking?
Yeah.
sometimes, though, Richard, um, you kind of got to do things and talk as you go along, and sometimes things can't be that planned out.
I agree with you.
the problem with having no conversation whatsoever, or lots of people talking about different things is that nobody's working toward a particular goal.
not the silly little stuff about, oh, who's going to sleep where?
what are we going to do?
but why are we here?
and what's the point?
and if we don't...
Oh, I figured that out before I come here.
for you... And you haven't?
and I have for me, but we haven't for us.
and for the next seven ejections, 21 days, we have to function together, or we fail.
what do you think we're doing now?
not functioning together at all.
I'm a redneck, and I don't know corporate world at all, and corporate world ain't gonna work out here in the bush.
no, I'm not talking corporate world.
I'm talking creating a team.
I thought we were doing good.
but, see, creating a team is actually putting all of our hands together...
not hands, all of us knowing what we're doing.
Yeah, the hand thing, yeah, but that's...
action, man. Action, Richard.
action.
well, you don't want to act ahead.
richard: I'm good to go survivalwise.
Peoplewise, it'll be a little more challenging.
but I've got the million dollar check written already.
I mean, I'm the winner.
and it's that kind of cocky attitude that makes people really hate your guts.
so that's the kind of thing, I've really got to keep, uh...
under wraps.
but, uh, it's just, how do I get there from here?
what's that?
Whoa! Look at this, folks.
if this is kerosene, and we didn't take one of those lamps...
we can make torches and stuff out of twine.
we could twine all the rafts together.
JOEL: What is that?
biscuits.
Yeah, it's definitely biscuits, 'cause we got corn...
well, look, we got a frying pan.
Oh, we are so set.
look, I'm shaking it.
can anyone hear the biscuits?
Oh, ho, we got a team flag.
Whoo-hoo!
if that's our latrine,
I say we dig a hole, put this here, knock a board out of the bottom, then we can keep moving it across.
let's plug the hole.
SEAN: Let's sit down and talk about what the hell we're going to do.
richard: Can I help?
when I asked earlier about having a conversation, that's what I was talking about, and I really can help with how we can do this.
we wanted to see...
you guys, we came over here to talk.
we just want to see what we...
richard: What happens when people get together is if they aren't all headed in the same direction, toward a particular goal, then things that individuals do kind of get in the way of the whole team, and I think it's really, really important that what we decide be decided as a group.
so, if you hear somebody saying something and you're all aggravated with them, stop, don't try to make your point and try and help them make theirs.
so, for example, you know, Sean, what do you think a main point of what I'm trying to say now is?
I didn't listen to a word you...
I've been daydreaming, thinking, What am I going to eat?
well, you'll begin to figure that out...
all right, we got a stick up.
well, as long as they can hit the middle of this hole, we're all set here.
put it right like this.
this is perfect.
Hey, we found a water map!
you got it?
we got a water map.
B. B. Enter jungle here.
walk 375 paces along...
Oh, we start here.
we go back to the other stream down there and then we get the water here.
B. B. Here's where we are right here.
we have to go across the stream.
we go across one stream...
two, three. Two streams, three stream
all right.
all right, we're ready to roll.
all right.
you all right?
okay, is this the path?
well, it said "newly cut path."
it looks newly cut, but...
trail washes out.
Oh, the trail washesout.
Oh, wa...?
no?
B. B. Why don't you stay there for a minute?
let me walk and keep you in sight...
okay.
...to see if I see...
anything?
...anything that resembles anything.
do you see anything?
huh?
look here.
I mean, come here and look at it.
okay, ready?
Oh, thank you, Jesus.
Christ!
Yeah.
there we are. Go ahead.
all right.
way to go, B. B.
don't let me drop sweat in there.
okay, it's almost full.
you know, we could never do this, but you know what thought crossed my mind?
what?
as long as you and I always know where the water is and we got control of the water map, no one else will be able to vote you or I out.
we're not giving up the secret...
we're not giving up the secret.
...of the water supply.
that's right!
and your wife is how old now?
B. B. My wife? Right now?
Yeah.
she's 45.
Wow. And how old are you?
Oh, you better go.
you are a stud.
he's a stud!
his name's Viagra.
Viagra. That's his nickname.
dang!
you know, you got to do what you got to do, right?
somebody has to do the dirty work.
if we don't keep some humor... we'll go mad.
good night, y'all.
good night.
good night.
stretch out.
Rudy: The hardest part is hanging around with all these young kids.
I don't even know what MTV means, you know?
and I'm used to being in the military and one guy stands up, he gives an order and there's no back talk.
you know, like yesterday, everybody's trying to run the show and if they'd let one person do it, we'd be much better off.
but trying to keep them all shut up is hard.
if they listen to me, they'd all have haircuts and everything else, you know.
we'd be in formation in the morning and all that kind of stuff, but they're not going to do that.
I got to fit in, not them.
you know, there's more of them than there is of me.
Hey, you got a pierced nipple, eh?
Yeah. I got the ol' pierced nipple thing.
how did that feel?
pretty edgy for a doctor, right?
Yeah, yeah.
I thought I was making it with the hair and then this morning, when I ran my hand through it and felt these couple of golf ball-sized knots in it,
I'm like, no, they got to come out now.
SONJA: I was doing something.
I don't even remember how I did it.
Betadine won't hurt it, yeah, so we'll give it a little shot of Betadine.
I think these are the only sponges we have, so I'm just going to keep reusing them.
okay.
SONJA: I've been thrashing around like I'm 35, instead of acting my age, but we have a doctor in our tribe-- uh, Sean-- and he did a wonderful job of bandaging me up.
I think one of the problems with aging is the thinning of the skin, darn it, and so I think I'm maybe getting a little more banged up than some of the younger ones.
my aim leaves something to be desired, but we're getting there.
try this?
well, I don't know.
this is heavier.
it might be sharper, though.
think so?
I'm wondering 'cause that's so damn hard.
well, that's off.
that ain't gonna work.
here's a, uh, a therapist's version of Bye, Bye, Blues,
if I can remember it.
bye-bye blues
thanks to Prozac
bye-bye blues
give me Paxil
bells ring, birds sing, Sun is shining, no more whining
I live through, ba, da, da-da
life is hell, but I'm swell
Bye-bye, bye blues.
Yeah, that's awesome, awesome.
fantastic.
richard: Well, the fish traps were hanging from the boat that we were coming over here, and when we were tossed into the sea on the raft and we could take whatever we could get our hands on, we grabbed three or four fish traps and a bunch of rat traps, and so we stuck the rat traps out the first night and boom, we got a rat in each of them.
bait. I want bait!
give me bait!
I think he's just going to cut its head off.
EW!
Oh, God!
Oh, no way!
remember that knife.
we're not using it for anything else.
Oh, dude!
RAMONA: I didn't sleep at all.
I mean, we-we closed our eyes.
we kept hearing noises and, like, clicking sounds, and we're, like, okay.
um, what's his name...
uh, Joel woke up, a rat was, like, in his ear.
JOEL: I heard something squeaking in my ear.
a rat was trying to get on the raft, or get near us or get at something.
I mean, everything was moving.
B. B. We're just going along the beach here and just identifying whatever we can use for the shelter, the roof.
and I'm a little irritated that none of the others are down here to help carry stuff, but that's okay.
we need... we need five more of these.
he's a character, man.
I don't think he likes me much.
just these.
no, no, you don't understand.
I got to have this thought out and positioned right.
GRETCHEN: He's right, Joel, or it's not going to fit the frame.
Joel, trust me.
I'm not the one bitching.
I mean, I'm fine.
Hey, don't be talking to me about monkey business.
I can't sleep, so I'm usually up.
...this being the width.
B. B. We got a lot of lazy people if you want to know the truth.
you can't do it all yourself.
you know, I asked Colleen to straighten this out for me and here it is.
that's the only thing she had to do today.
you can't have lazy people.
GRETCHEN: He had been out there, you know, all morning long and, um... you know, it was hot.
GRETCHEN: B. B. I thought we said that this was a time of day, we were going to be out of the sun.
well, but for some of us... some of the people, it's been all day that way.
right, it's your turn.
you tell me what you're doing here and I'll help you.
you hold it up and I'll do it quick.
I promise you, I'll do it quick.
that, you know, that's the right way to do it, but we won't have near enough line to build the roof and do that if we do all this, in all fairness.
anyway, don't stop now, but...
I think we'll have plenty, and I'm going to roll that up for you, too.
we can't, like, get burned out, though.
I'm not burned out.
I know, but you will be if you spend all day out in the sun.
no, I never get burned out.
you don't know me.
I don't know you, but I know human beings.
okay.
I like working as a hobby.
honest to God, how about 15 minutes though?
sit down for 15 minutes.
Why? Yeah, but, I want to get...
I want to get this thing stabilized so at least...
but, B. B. look...
let me just explain.
I want to get this stabilized so then people can come in here...
you know the light cords you got?
and we can tie these things down, but until I get this bounce out of this...
I want to... I'm going to put a support there in the middle here and right there.
cause if not, we got to take bounce out of this.
I just think we have plenty of time.
I thought we were going to try to stay competitive, and if you work all day and you're burnt at the end of the day, we're not going to be competitive.
take a break, and if it bounces a little tonight, then we'll fix it tomorrow.
I'm going to keep working, sweetheart.
you're going to get burned out.
no, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.
you already are.
B. B. Oh, my.
you're doing fine.
too much paper.
Yeah.
bifocals work?
bifocals worked.
you the man, B.
no, she took my bifocals...
we're both the man.
and made it happen.
B. B. And the fire started because I had bought a set of glasses with me.
I was going to do it and Gretchen said, "Why don't I do it?"
I know how to do it, too. So, I said, "Great."
nice, guys. You guys split up and everything.
Amen. Good work.
B. B. And she took my glasses and started the fire.
you did well, Gretch.
if we get fire, it means we're going to have a hot meal in our stomach which is going to bring up team morale.
that first meal might be rat soup, which I'm, like, looking forward to very much because there's nothing wrong with a rat.
all a rat is, is a squirrel without a fuzzy tail.
let's just work with this.
okay.
I'm thinking, if we could work with this, we're getting a ton of smoke.
start that piece of wood? If we get a piece of bamboo, someone sits here and holds the bamboo right here with the kindling in it. With the kindling in it.
you know what I'm saying?
here we go.
come on, Dirk.
go big.
this isn't going to catch.
well, you want to just keep trying?
why don't we try and make the bough?
man: Go...!
come on! We're getting there!
all right! Okay!
don't stop! Don't stop!
there was smoke. We lost it.
a lot of smoke. Yeah.
don't you guys...
cool!
how much more do we need?
I don't know.
how much more?
that'll do it.
you in, Rich?
here we go. Here we go.
work it, Rich.
Yeah.
what?
you guys get ready to take his spot.
take a break, man.
we made a lot smoke but no fire.
I think it would have been nice if we had fire, but we're not going to catch fish unless we have fire to cook it and I think that if we had fire, we could have spent a lot of time sitting around the bonfire at night maybe singing songs.
we have a ukulele, you know, and that didn't happen and I wish it did.
throughout their time on the island, the tribes will compete in a series of challenges.
they'll receive messages notifying them of these competitions at their tree mail.
today's challenge is for both reward, in the form of 50 waterproof matches, and immunity.
win immunity, you stay on the island a few days longer.
lose, face Tribal Council, where you must vote one member off the island.
Ooh.
a map to fire.
it's got to be.
cold food, dark camp, just a reminder of your first night.
it looks so easy in the book. Yes.
why is it so hard to light?
tonight your tribe will carry the torch.
one tribe takes home the flame.
the other gives someone the boot.
Whoa!
whoa.
I guess they're combining the reward and immunity challenge this time.
that's the competition is taking home the flame, but what's the competition? We've got no freakin' idea.
welcome, tribes, to your first challenge.
congratulations on your first night on the island-- should be very proud.
I know both of you guys have food.
you found some fresh water and I think, Pagong, you guys had fire.
right on.
a lot of work to get fire.
Yeah.
Yeah, it takes a lot of work.
with the threat of rain always a constant, even if you guys did have fire, you're certainly not back there tending to them now.
50 waterproof matches should certainly make that a lot easier.
it's one of the things you're playing for tonight-- the other is this:
I want everybody to touch this, get a good feel of this.
this is your life on the island.
this is the immunity idol.
Oh. Ah.
win this, you stay on the island a few days longer.
lose...
you face tomorrow's Tribal Council, where one of you will be the first person voted off the island.
big enough stakes?
Oh, yeah.
okay, here's what we're doing.
there are two rafts about 150 feet out in the water.
your job is to get your raft back to the beach.
along the way, a series of torches both in the water and on the land.
first team to light all their torches and their side of the fire spirit wins immunity.
here are the rules: Each tribe member has to have one hand on the raft at all times, at all times.
nobody can swim ahead.
nobody can fall behind.
the other rule: you have to light every torch.
don't put me in the position of having to make a judgment call.
I don't want to. There's too much at stake.
clear?
all: Clear.
all right, swim out to your rafts.
wait for my signal.
okay, Sue, listen up.
you're going to hold this.
how's that feel for you carrying?
Jeff: Here we go!
a storm is approaching!
waterproof matches and immunity at stake!
go!
go! Here we go!
keep going. You got to lift.
come on, team!
here we go! Light it! Light it!
dry run it. Dry run it.
go, go, go!
slow it down.
go!
here we go. Come on, y'all. Come on.
do not wait for me.
no, no, no!
go. Go. We got it.
good job.
go!
go!
throw it!
go! Here we go! Come on!
to the flag!
calm down.
pick it up. Pick it up.
here comes the wave.
pick it up. Pick it up.
let's go.
move it! Move it! Move it!
move it, move it, move it!
move it, move it, move it!
make sure you get it.
let's go!
here we go! Let's go!
stop!
come on, team!
we're doing good.
three!
come on!
go!
we're still there! Seven!
we're doing it, we're doing it, we're doing it.
we're still there. Come on.
come on! We're still there!
we're still there!
we win!
going back!
it's lit! It's lit!
no, keep it there.
we got it!
Yay!
Yay! Yeah, baby!
Yes!
Jeff: Guys, great competition.
really close.
Pagong, you get fire in the form of 50 waterproof matches.
and more importantly...
immunity from tomorrow's Tribal Council.
you'll stay on the island a few more days.
Yes! This is happening every time!
every time, this is happening!
every time!
that's why we're winning.
we're going to stay...
our island!
nice competition.
you know the drill.
you have a date with me tomorrow for the Tribal Council, where one of you will be the first person voted off.
you guys seen Dirk?
where the hell did he go?
Oh, he goes... He brought his bible with him?
Yeah. Yeah.
I think he's pretty religious.
he was telling me he was a youth minister or something.
rain's coming.
again?
that's all right.
I could always use a wash.
Rudy: Before we got on the island here,
I formed opinions about people, but I changed my mind just on that trip in.
rich, for one.
I mean, this guy is... He's strong.
he's smart.
the guy surprises me.
you know, he's fat, but he's...
he's good.
you can lay it over those.
richard: I like Rudy.
I'm not bothered by his straightforwardness at all.
I don't think it's even a problem.
I-I like it that he's saying "Hey, do this," or, "Hey, do that,"
but people are thinking of that as very direct and arrogant.
that's the word I'm hearing, and I'm thinking to myself "Well, they thinkhe'sarrogant; Oh, my God, I'm out of here!
Oh, my gosh.
what do we got?
the good news is we'll be having fire tonight.
the bad news is one of us won't be here to enjoy it.
we got Tribal Council tonight.
pack your bags, get ready to go, which one it will be, the world will soon know.
kelly: Unfortunately, we're going to have to vote somebody off.
there's going to be a lot of tension and one of us is going to leave.
well, what time we got to do this at?
it just said, "Get ready to go."
just, "Pack your bags, get ready to go."
I can't believe we have to pack up.
we're just getting settled.
well, somebody's gone.
so, it's time to think about who are they going to vote for?
why are they going to vote?
I've narrowed it down to four.
I'm one of them.
well, it could mean a lot uh, either staying or being voted out.
you know, last night's competition,
I really feel responsible because I couldn't keep up and I was dragged totally off my feet.
I do feel that that stumble probably cost us the immunity challenge, and that's a big one.
up until, uh, probably last night,
I never gave it a second thought about who I was going to vote off or if I got voted off, but after last night, uh...
I thought about it then, and I decided then.
I feel pretty secure, actually, about the vote tonight.
Kelly and I get along real well and we've been talking about strategy, and, you know, who's not contributing as much, and who would be best to vote off, and I think we-we've come to a mutual decision and we've talked to Sue about it.
Stacey came up to me, and it's, like, she don't like Rudy and she's, like, "Oh, I think we're going to vote for Rudy,"
and vote him off 'cause he's so barking.
well, anybody's too barking and too bossy to Stacey because she doesn't move her ass.
the chicks think I'm voting for one person, and I'm not.
this is Tribal Council, where each week one member will be voted off the island.
last night, in a crushing defeat
Tagi lost the immunity challenge, so, tonight, they will come here and vote the first person off.
it all begins with a dangerous hike through the jungle.
with so little time to get acquainted, everyone is vulnerable.
rich's talk-versus-action approach may be more annoying than helpful.
sonja's tumble cost them dearly.
one thing's for certain:
at Tribal Council, youareheld accountable for your actions.
Therewillbe a vote.
Someoneisgoing home.
I see torches.
Oh, that looks pretty hairy.
make our way around.
we begin Tribal Council with a ritual.
behind each of you is a torch.
I'd like you to grab the torch and approach the fire.
go ahead and dip your torches in the flame and light them.
put them back in their slot, and take a seat.
we do this because
as I'm sure you've discovered
on the island, fire represents life.
these torches now represent your life, your identity here at Tribal Council.
the good news is you will take these torches with you when you leave so you will have fire, and you will bring them back with you to each Tribal Council.
go ahead and have a seat.
well, leave it to me to state the obvious, but this is not a place you want to be.
you tread in dangerous territory every time you come here.
tribal Council is basically where you account for your actions on the island.
some of those actions will come back to help you.
some of them may come back to haunt you, but tonight, based on those actions, one of you will be the first person voted off the island.
so, before we get to the vote, let's talk about what's been going on.
I'm curious just about you guys getting here and finding this place.
how was the journey over here?
saw two deadly snakes.
Really?
SUSAN: Grand Canyon mud slides...
it was great.
it was fun.
we're still starving.
we've eaten but not really.
SONJA: The competition is stiffer.
the competition we had last night was tough, tougher than I had anticipated.
how are you holding up, physically?
SONJA: Well, pretty well, you know.
I'll fight to the finish, but, uh, I have my blisters and whatnot, but I'm-I'm doing okay.
what happened after Quest for Fire?
that was a great competition
obviously, a lot at stake.
SONJA: Oh, God.
we came close.
we almost got it.
SUSAN: Aw, man, we were dragged down two times and we were right there.
we almost got it.
SUSAN: There's no way.
all right, guys, well...
it's obviously a fun group.
this is not a pleasant process...
no, not at all.
Jeff: And I know also, from listening to you guys talk, that there are a lot of different reasons why you're here.
obviously, $1 million-- big motivator for anybody, but I'm sensing there could be personal reasons, different journeys you might be on that-that this encompasses.
whatever it is, to fulfill that agenda, you have to survive tonight's Tribal Council.
that's the way it's set up.
so, what we're going to do is vote and how it will work is you'll come down here.
you'll go across this bridge into our voting confessional.
write the name of the person you want to vote off
large, clear letters.
hold it up, and speak your piece.
we can't hear you.
fold it up, put it in the container, come back, and take a seat.
now, once the votes are tallied, the decision is final and you have to leave the Tribal Council area immediately.
it's time to vote.
you're first.
I'll do the best I can.
got to remove the weakest link in the... crew.
um, tough call.
subtle reasons...
I'm not sure exactly what they are.
he's just...
he's an ornery guy...
doesn't really help that much.
for a Navy SEAL, he doesn't know how to start fire...
and he just criticizes everything.
I'm picking her because I think she's the reason we lost yesterday.
I'll miss his, uh, skills and, um, his speaking his mind openly.
before I read these votes, I just want to commend you on the courage it's taken to get this far.
there were a lot of steps along the way.
any of you could've turned around.
nobody did, and in my book that gives you bragging rights for life.
so, with that, I'll read the votes.
first vote-- Sonja.
that's three for Sonja and three for Rudy.
the first person voted off the island...
Sonja, I need you to grab your torch and bring it to me.
the tribe has spoken.
go get 'em, you guys.
rich: Thanks, Sonja.
Thanks. Thank you.
it's time for you to go.
Jeff: Well, to the rest of you, I guess a somber congratulations.
you've survived the Tribal Council.
you have fire.
you can head back to camp and I will see you tomorrow for the next challenge.
good night.
Jeff: Next week, on Survivor...
I've been working my ass off and a lot of you have been laying on your ass watching me.
don't give me any of that ...
Rudy: Me and Richard got to be pretty good friends
not in a homosexual way, that's for sure.
swallow it, Gervase!
well, I think this has been, uh, an awesome experience.
being the first to be voted out is a little humiliating.
on the other hand, the team did the right thing.
they're a terrific group of people.
they're very strong physically, and I-I think in their shoes, I'd probably do the same thing.
on day 22, Marcus, the leader of the Kota alliance, was so confident,
he was able to throw away a hidden immunity idol.
these people are so stupid.
I got ten people to throw an immunity idol into the ocean.
that is a very prized possession there this game,
and somebody is really going to wish they had that in a few days.
but the days of Kota dominance we coming to an end.
by using brilliant strategy, a rival alliance led by Kenny...
behind the scenes I'm calling the shots.
systematically dismantled their foes.
they even tricked Randy into playing a fake idol.
this is not a hidden immunity idol.
sending him home and humiliating him at the same time.
it wasn't just ha-ha-ha help it was on and on and on.
and I was, to say the least, irritated.
can Bob and Corinne, the two remaining Kotas,
come up with a brilliant strategy on their own to stay in the game is there seven are left.
who will be voted out tonight?
that was crazy!
Yeah, the best tribal so far, for sure.
I think it was.
that was your idea to give Randy the fake idol?
don't laugh like that.
you know, that pisses me off, that I'm part of stickg it in his face.
I didn't mind doing the thing, but then to just belittle him as he was going out, piss me off.
I'm sorry, Bob. - I'm over it now.
but don't ever do that again. - I really am sorry.
I know you feel bad. I'm sorry.
I don't feel one iota, a bit, sorry for Randy because he dug his own grave,
and it's hilarious that somebody gave him a fake idol and he played it.
for all the lessons you have to teach me, right, about not belittling people.
Corinne, you talk about people all the time behind their back
and to their face you act like a really sweet little girl with a bow on your head.
I'm not acting like a sweet girl.
if I told everybody to their face what I said behind their back
I wouldn't be playing a very good game, would I.
you shouldn't be talking about people behind their back.
I'm on "Survivor." You don't come here to make friends.
you come here to play the game.
exactly. You hit the nail on the head, Corinne.
we're here to play the game, and we're playing the game.
in general, I'm a nice person to people I like.
I am now in a camp of mutants, none of whom I like,
so it's very difficult for me to pretend to be nice to them.
that's not something I'm used to.
and look at this guy. Look at this guy.
Oh, he's heavy!
I would never have imagined me booing out here and catching fish.
I'm not an outdoorsy type of person.
I'm just a gamer at home but out here, I'm my own man.
so I am very proud of myself because guys like me would never ever be out here in a situation like this.
only in the game of "Survivor."
we're going to eat today, you people!
that's the biggest fish, I think I've ever seen anybody catch.
that thing is huge.
that looks like a mini-shark.
this is great, aye been able to catch turtle and crawfish.
it's kind of weird.
there you go!
Bob doesn't look out for himself.
he doesn't know how to play this game at all.
he's just here to build things, and that's stupid, you know.
he's taught me a lot out here, but as far as playing the game, he's not very good at it.
good job, Bob!
I don't mind getting rid of Bob.
I feel like I need to pull the power into my own hands and take charge.
come on in, guys!
you guys ready to get to today's challenge?
Yeah. - Yes, sir.
for today's challenge, you will divide into two teams of three.
on my "go," you will race out into the swamp
where you will find two station of sprocket-shaped puzzle pieces.
once you've collected all seven pieces,
you mutt then arrange the pieces so they work together allowing to you raise the flag.
the first team of three to raise their flag,
moves on to the final round where you will square off against each other to solve a slide puzzle.
the first person to solve the slide puzzle wins reward.
want to know what you're playing for? - Yeah.
31 days is a long time to be without love.
I wish I could tell you your loved ones were here coming around the corner.
they're not.
but that doesn't mean you can't have a little love right now.
I have a Samsung instinct by Sprint, loaded on to this phone are video messages from your loved ones at home.
I'm going to give you a little taste of that love right now.
here's Andre and Dustin.
Hi, Crystal.
just want you to know everything is going well here on the homefront.
Hi, moment. This is Jesse. I love you, be safe.
thank you. I needed that.
all right, Ken, you ready for a little love?
Kenny, here's your sister, Jenny.
Hey, Ken. It's Jenny. I love you so much. I miss you.
do your best, and never give up.
I can't believe I'm crying.
Why? - I miss her. I miss family. It's been rough.
you guys can crowd around too, if you want to see each other's.
you guys get to see my baby, I hope.
Hi, hon, we miss you something terrible. - Me baby!
the house is way too quiet.
the man and your son, your two money.
all right, Corinne.
Hi, Corinne! We miss you.
Hey, sis. Hope you're doing good out there. Kind of miss you over here.
I've got no one to talk to when I've got something crazy to tell someone.
you have the whole family and the brother.
all right, Bob. Here's Peggy.
Hi, Bob. How you doing?
I hope that you're doing really well.
what I mostly hope is that you're having the adventure of your lifetime.
she's pretty. - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
now that's support.
all she said was,"I just hope you're having the adveure of a lifetime."
Yup. She's behind me 100%. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Matty, you look anxious. You want to go next? All right.
who do you want to hear from? - Jaime.
all right.
Hi, baby! How are you doing? We're happy as can be.
yet, we do miss our other partner, our family member, Matty.
and don't ever forget that we love you.
we'll be here when you return. I love you so much.
last, but certainly not least, Sugar.
here's your sister, Rena.
Hey, hope you're enjoying yourself.
you have us supporting you all the way, but especially dad, smiling down at you from above.
and remember that. We love you so much.
thank you. - Pretty nice message.
it's really nice to see her and hear that from her.
all right, guys. Thanks for sharing those with me.
all right, so, the winner of today's challenge will enjoy their entire loved one message.
there is more. On the Sprint phone, while enjoying a nice little afternoon of pizza, beer, brownies.
you'll fill up your belly, and you will fill up your heart.
worth playing for? - Oh, yeah.
one more thing.
because today is all about love, nobody is going to exile island.
all right, we're going to draw for teams.
take a stone. Please don't look.
come on, now, keep it covered.
all right, everybody palms out and reveal.
if you have a yellow or red, you're a captain. Take a spot over here.
crystal and Susie.
all right, we're going to rock, paper, scissor. See who goes first.
one, two, three.
scissors. - Scissor cuts paper.
Susie, you choose first. - Who do you want on your team? Matty.
crystal, who do you want? - Sugar.
Matty's choice. - Kenny.
sugar, who do you want? - Bob.
Bob. We have our two teams.
sugar, Crystal, and Bob, taking on Kenny, Matty, and Susie.
Corinne, not chosen.
Corinne will not have any shot of winning this reward.
when they started to pick and Crystal immediately picked Sugar I realized right away they're all about,
you know, sticking together, sticking together, and it sucks.
I don't want to go home, and I don't know, you know, what to do to save myself.
here we go. Survivors ready?
go.
out into the muddy swamp.
crystal, Sugar, Bob, all take a hard fall right off the bat.
crystal dragging Sugar.
crystal not slowing down for anybody.
gonna have to work together or this is going to be really frustrating.
crystal, Sugar, Bob, first with their pieces.
Matty, Susie, and Kenny right behind.
sugar goes down again!
that swamp is thick with mud.
hard to move.
Matty, Susie, and Kenny now making up a lot of ground.
crystal now stuck.
Matty, Kenny, Susie back with their first three pieces.
good job, good job!
come on!
crystal, Sugar, Bob, back with their first three pieces.
how much document that love?
pizza, beer, brownies.
long video message from home.
Kenny, Susie, and Matty have a good stride going.
working well together. - Over here, baby!
everybody exhausted.
Matty, Susie, Kenny have their last four sprocket pieces heading back.
meat, meat! - I can't!
I have no hands. - I know, Matty, but.
Bob, Crystal, Sugar have their final four sprocket pieces.
they're heading back.
Kenny, Susie, Matty, extending their lead.
Bob, Sugar, Crystal playing it very safe.
this is it! This is it!
Matty, Kenny Susie back with their final four sprocket pieces, start work the puzzle.
for Matty, Kenny, and Susie.
Bob, Sugar, and Crystal are back.
start working on it.
all the pieces should interlock so that when you turn them, they will raise the flag.
Bob, the physics teacher, leading his team.
Kenny, the gamer, leading his team.
wrong way. - Right behind you!
Bob, Sugar, and Crystal making a lot of progress.
getting very close with the yellow team.
Bob thinks they have it.
and they do!
sugar, Crystal, Bob moving on to the final round!
nice comeback, guys.
nice try, guys.
first to solve this slide puzzle wins reward.
survivors ready? Go.
in front of you is what you were trying to duplicate.
Bob thinks he has it.
and very quickly, Bob wins reward!
go, Bob!
that was fast. Bob, come on over. Congratulations.
pizza, beer, brownies.
loved one from home on the Sprint phone. This is for you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
for the rest of you, sorry, I got nothing for you.
head back to camp.
I really wanted to win that reward.
I just wanted to see the whole message that my sister had for me.
but Bob won, and we think he's a threat, so if he doesn't win immunity, then he's next to go.
Hi, Bob. How you doing?
you, you know, I miss you an awful lot.
I know you're going to do well, and there's something I wanted to show you. Hang on.
Oh, my god! Will be can you believe this.
look what we have! Have you been eating?
wait, I'll go get some termites.
no.
Oh, yeah, we've been eating termites and turtle soup.
the moment I saw Bob be I couldn't believe what he looked like.
I was so excited. He smelled like a campfire.
he smelled so good. He had that full board.
Oh, Bob!
he looks dirty, but I can tell he's very happy.
you look really good.
Peggy's here.
I was completely convinced, as was everybody else, that the loved ones sent a video.
Cheers! We're in Africa!
are you okay?
then you were like, to get back on the thing...
Oh, my god! It's Peggy! Oh, my god!
are you kidding!
she's coming!
this is home.
really nice to meet you.
nice to see you. - Who's that?
Kenny, Kenny, how nice to meet you. Matty.
this is really cool. Watch this.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!
so happy to see Andre. Not good enough to explain.
I haven't seen him in so long.
and it was just so good to hold him.
I totally didn't expect to see you guys. We were talking about it.
seeing my brother and seeing somebody who loves me and who knows me
and who gets my sense of humor and who knows how mean I am and loves it, was such a cool
like, I was overcome with emotion.
it's Sugar and Crystal.
and they trust me 100% because I saved both their asses.
I saved both their ass.
and right now everybody trusts me, but I will blindsight Matty.
I took out five powerhouse, big guys.
everybody loves me.
if I make the final three, I will win this game.
I'll tell you one thing, dad would be so proud of you. - Yeah.
I did "Survivor" because I thought it might help me get a little bit of closure from my dad's passing,
so my sister brought some of my dad's ashes.
do you want to say a prayer? - Yeah.
Thanks, dad, for everything you've done for me, and I know that you're the one
you're the reason that I'm here.
and you're here with me every day that I've been here, especially
when we were on exile, and thank you for this awesome opportunity.
and thanks for being here with me and keeping me strong and letting me see Rena
and having all this incredible stuff happen.
have fun in Africa, dad.
I didn't speak at his funeral because I was a big mess.
so it felt good to say a few words because I really needed him here and I feel like he's
like everybody felt like he was here, but I feel like I brought him to Africa and he got to stay.
where are you going?
down here. - Okay.
I've always been kind of weak, and I've always wanted to avoid the tough things in life,
you know, like settling down and being an adult, you know.
and that's what I realized out here.
I have to face up to my fears and grow up.
and I don't want to let another day pass and me not let Jaime know
how much she means to me and how much I value her.
this is incredible. I love this.
Yeah. - I love you.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
I want to do the same, baby, I want to do the same.
I want to share family and you and I want to share kids and I want to share the future
and I want to share the past and I want to share everything, Jaime.
I really- we will, baby, we will.
I just want to know right now. I really want you to be my wife.
and I want- I want to marry you and I want you to be my wife, and I made this for you.
will you be my wife?
Yes, baby. Yes! Yes!
I'm not joke around or joking. I really love you.
I love you.
here, I made it for you. - You made this?
Yeah. I'll get down on my knees. Will you be my wife?
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
I love you, Jaime.
the whole experience today, it means everything to me because I know
that Todd's really proud of me, so that makes me feel really good.
the good things in life aren't easy.
and they require a lot of work.
and a lot of digging deep.
and if you keep digging, you will find it.
I mean, it's endless.
you have so much ability and gold in you, and if you just dig for it, you will find it.
who wants to get tree mail? - I'll go.
Corinne, get tree mail. - Can I go with Corinne?
Yeah, you guys go. - Bye.
you know, there is a possibility, very slight,
that they might get rid of Matty if he doesn't win immunity.
here's what I'm thinking
you guys don't you think it's weird a tribe of people are living together
and a couple of them are gone.
it's weird.
for now, us five are stick together because we have a better chance that way.
hopefully, nobody is going to flip.
he's good at everything.
you're the only person that stands a chance against Bob in a physical challenge, really.
Yeah. - That's true, man.
the plan is to vote out Bob and then Corinne because Bob is way bigger of a threat.
remember when we threw the idol into the ocean?
Yes.
and they never went and checked the bottle, but Marcus threw it in.
did you know that he had the idol in his pocket when he came back
and hid it around camp and showed me where it was and said, - it's hidden over here. - No way.
of he didn't have it when he went to tribal, so if I win immunity, I can give that you to.
it's a legitimate idol?
no, but it sounded pretty good, didn't it?
Yeah, it did.
I'm going to put it together, and I'm going to imply that I've got the idol we were supposed to have thrown in the ocean.
I am going to make my second very good fake idol of the game, and plan the plan with the idol is I'm going to tell somebody on the other side that I've got the original idol that was supposed to have gone into the ocean.
so they've got to be careful how they vote.
the problem is one of us would have to win immunity.
well, we'll do that.
good for you, Bob! good plan!
come on in, guys!
you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
first things first-- Kenny, give it up.
once again, immunity is back up for grabs.
for today's challenge, I'm going to ask you questions about Gabon.
each time you answer correctly, you earn a ball.
you're going to take turns throwing your balls toward a target divided by zones.
guaranteed a one in six shot at winning this game.
losers go to tribal council, where somebody will be voted out.
anything not clear?
let's get started.
all right, here we go. First question:
true or false-- gorillas were actually first discovered here in Gabon?
all right, everybody, reveal.
correct answer is... true.
sugar got it right, Corinne got it right.
gorillas were discovered here in Sugar gets a ball, Corinne gets a ball.
next question: a male elephant is called a bull.
a female elephant is called, everybody reveal.
correct answer is, c,the cow, Sugar got it right, Susie got it right, Corinne got it right.
it is a fact the Gabonnese a poisonous snake.
true or false, it is considered virtually harmless to humans.
everybody reveal.
Susie and Corinne say it is true that it is virtually harmless to humans.
a poisonous snake, Susie and Corinne, is deadly to humans.
the answer is false.
Yes, it was a trick question.
good news is, everybody's on the board, everybody's going to get at least one shot at the target.
sugar currently in front with three shots.
last question: true or false
the elephant's trunk has three purposes
it servings as its nose, its arm, and its mouth.
everybody reveal.
crystal says true, Susie says true.
the trung is the nose and the arm. it is not the mouth.
Kenny got it right, Matty got it right. Sugar got it right.
Corinne got it right, and Bob got it right.
all right, well we know what you know about Gabon.
let's see how it plays out. Head over here.
Kenny, you're first up.
good luck, Kenny. - Let's do this!
Kenny has two because. Using your first one.
no hesitation. - What?!
nice shot, sixth zone from the center.
Matty, you're trying to get as close as you can to that center zone.
that looks good.
fourth zone from the center.
Matty is now the mark to beat.
Oh, soft launch, going to look for some roll.
she gets it. Not close enough.
Matty still the mark to beat.
Susie, you get one shot, don't be short, woman. Come strong.
good launch.
not going to be good enough.
no shot at winning immunity.
good-looking toss.
no, fifth zone from the middle.
Matty still the mark to beat.
Bob going to take his first shot.
it's all physics.
good follow-through. Look at that.
Bob with his first toss is now the mark to beat.
good job, Bob. - Nice job.
crystal got one question right and gets only one shot.
crystal with no backspin. Gets a good roll. Not good enough.
crystal's now out of the challenge.
Kenny launches it.
Oh it was in, and then out.
Oh, Kenny!
Kenny is out of this challenge now.
Matty with his last shot at this.
Oh, Matt!
Nope, Matty falls short.
Matty is now out of this challenge.
no shot at winning.
sugar up next.
nice little soft touch.
Oh, just misses. Not close enough.
Corinne is up.
big immunity on the line.
good toss. Too far out.
Bob's up. He is already the mark to beat.
he can afford to be a little risky now.
it's going to be short. Will it roll?
it does. Bob improves mark. He is now one zone from the center.
going to be very tough to beat Bob.
sugar going for the roll, and she won't get it.
Bob still the mark to beat.
Corinne. Last shot at immunity.
goes very high. Will she get a good kick?
she does. Is it going to be enough? No.
Corinne has no shot at Immunity.
Bob, with your last ball.
Bob doesn't improve his lie.
Bob is still the mark to beat, though.
one last shot,Sugar. This is it.
you need to get in either the center zone or the first zone outside of the center.
anythings else doesn't matter.
sugar launches it. And a good roll. It's in and out of the center.
Bob wins immunity! - Good job, Bob.
handshake?
Bob, come on over.
nice Bob. - Thank you, sir.
Bob is safe at tonight's tribal council, cannot be voted out of this game air, one in six shot at winning it all.
the rest of you, tribal council tonight where one of you will be voted out of this game.
grab your stuff, head back to camp, see you at tribal.
winning today's immunity challenge saved me.
I'm going to get the fake idol built.
there are five fang members here and I am going to suggest two of them go in with corinne and I.
if all goes as planned, perfect time to blindside Matty.
well done, Bob.
Yeah, very good.
feel like a big dunce.
obviously, Bob and I know that our numbers up, so we've got this whole backstory about why we have the idol that was supposedly launched into the ocean.
but what we need to have this work correctly is at least one of us to get the immunity idol, which is exactly what happened.
you were the only person that knew about it. I've never known about it.
if you hadn't gotten immunity tonight, you would have used it for yourself.
but you got immunity, and the only way to keep yourself in this game is to give it to me so I'm still in the game and take out the strongest player, being Matty.
if they think I'm going to play the idol, they're not going to want to vote me.
you you are a conning son of a gun.
thank you I hope this works. It's a long shot.
I think I'm very smart, and Bob is very crafty and we put those two forces together, and this is the best we could do.
it would be so awesome if this worked.
the only thing, I think, Corinne is trying to make Bob give her the immunity necklace.
probably.
if he gives it to her, it will still be four for the vote.
all we know is this five is tight and we're staying strong, and Corinne's gone.
no one's flipping, and we're good.
I don't know why everybody is worried.
because this game makes you worry, man.
Bob won the immunity challenge today, so today we need to vote out Corinne.
and Bob is a major threat when it comes down to it.
so... it's nervous wracking, man.
you really can't say anything.
I promise. I swear.
so remember when they threw the idol out into the ocean?
well, Marcus ripped the string and had the rest of the idol in his pocket, never put it in the ocean.
he brought it back to camp and hid it with Bob.
but since he won immunity today, he said, listen, if we use it now it will help.
who are you guys going to take out?
we're going to take out Matty, and that's it.
I think right now, you're and bob's best chance is to take out Matty.
let me see if I can get Bob.
I think me, you, and Bob should talk.
he doesn't know I told you yet. Let me soften the blow.
this has definitely changed the game and I think the best shot is to blindside Matty right now.
I think I might have to jump alliances now.
Oh, my god.
so we're trying to figure out the best way to strategize. I don't know.
tell us, because you're just as smart as we are, and we need your input.
I know Matty is not that smart.
I think that your best chance is to take out Matty.
do you think maybe the better person, because she's smarter, is Crystal.
do you think Crystal would separate from the others?
I think Crystal would probably join us. - So maybe
if we get Crystal in, we'll go to the final four. - Yup.
so we'll figure it out from there. - Yeah.
we come up with a ridiculously hairbrained scheme that shouldn't work at all,
and it might actually work, which is so blind blowing.
it just shows you the level of incompetence we're playing with.
what we're going to do is ask Crystal if she'd like to be on our alliance.
and we're giving her the chance to join with us.
I just collected these pieces.
I'm worse than a raven.
I save everything.
I don't know about you, but that would fool me.
Highway close were you to Marcus when he threw it in?
we were far.
you saw the idol that was on the bottle, right?
Yeah.
it had a face on it. It was...
final four, you, me, Kenny, and Corinne.
we don't want to use this tonight.
would you be interested in taking out Matty tonight?
go on board with us.
operation fake idol, 2,is working like a charm.
and the interesting thing, is we're not even going to have to use the idol.
that's Matty.
we're taking out Matty. Even better for us.
we have to flush out their idol.
Bob shook my hand and gave me a kiss on the cheek.
so that's a big deal for him.
you have to vote for Corinne. - Okay.
you understand that.
everybody's voting for Corinne, yes.
I'm going to vote for Matty. - Three for Matty. Four for Corinne.
Matty's gone, boom!
this is the best plan.
I know for a fact that Crystal is going to vote for Corinne,
and Koirn is going to play her idol, a win-win situation for me,
because the idol is flushed out, and Matty is going home.
if this plan works out, I'll be the biggest strategist in survivor history.
but it's going to be a little tense there tonight.
we'll have numbers out there tonight at least.
I think it's the best.
I think the four of us
this is going to be like we're swapping the game, but hopefully it's a good choice.
every fiber of me wants to trust Kenny.
if the idol is real, then Matty is gone.
but if they've got a fake idol, Corinne goes home,
and I've definitely been weighing who it is better to take out.
my heart tells me to take Matty out.
Corinne is not the threat to me.
this is my only chance to get him out.
this is racking my brain.
the mental part of this game is kicking my ass.
we'll now bring in the members of our jury.
Marcus, Charlie, and Randy, voted out at the last tribal council.
Susie, can you still feel old tribal lines, or is this now how do I win this game?
alliances that you make have to get you to a certain point,
and when people start getting paranoid it's a domino effect.
so you do have to think ahead.
Bob, does this make sense, this paranoia? Is that inevitable?
this is the first time I haven't been paranoid.
I get to realize what it feels like to have this on.
but I'll be paranoid next time I come in here.
Corinne, can paranoia be an advantage?
I suppose it can.
you know, obviously, Bob and I are kind of on the outside, and they're a tight group of five.
if paranoia sets in, maybe there is a possibility to try and, you know, break it up.
sugar, what's the worst part about paranoia as it relates to your game?
people freaking out and believing lies and flipping.
I mean, you just have to, like, keep everybody in check,
and make sure nobody is being gullible and geting duped.
crystal, at a certain point does it become crazy to trust?
with certain people, yes.
certain people, no.
and is the whole trick of this game figuring out when that time is?
that is the whole trick of the game.
knowing when to trust and when to cut your ties.
Kenny, is tonight's vote any more important, less important than any other vote?
I think it's very important tonight.
because you think that you can trust somebody, and then you don't.
because after you see the votes, you're going to be like, "whoa! Who did this? Who did that."
I would say tonight's vote is very important, compared to any other vote.
all right, let's get to the vote.
Bob, you have the individual immunity necklace.
I assume you're going to keep it for yourself tonight.
very good assumption.
cannot vote for Bob. Everybody else is fair game.
it is time to vote. Corinne, you're up.
Matty, this is clearly a strategic move.
I'll go tally the votes.
if anybody has the hidden immunity idol
and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
okay. Once the votes are ready, the decision is final.
the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
first vote, Matty.
Corinne. One vote Matty, one vote Corinne.
Corinne. Two votes Corinne, one vote Matty.
Corinne. That's three votes Corinne, one vote Matty.
Matty. Two votes Matty, three votes Corinne.
Matty. We're tied.
three votes Corinne, three votes Matty, one vote left.
12th person voted out of Survivor: Gabon and the fourth member of our jury.
Corinne, you need to bring me your torch.
Corinne, the tribe has spoken.
time for you to go. - Thanks.
the big theme of the night- paranoia.
the question is how do you make the paranoia work for you and not against you?
grab your torches. Head back to camp. Good night.
all right!
let's do it!
you look nervous, bob.
and sugar.
I've got some votes.
a jury of your peers has decided who they feel is most worthy of the title of soul survivor
and a million-dollar check.
tonight, you want to see your name.
usually, votes are bad.
tonight, they're worth a million bucks.
it is time to read the votes.
first vote.
one vote bob, one vote susie.
two votes susie, one vote bob.
three votes susie, one vote bob, no votes sugar.
three votes susie, two votes bob.
we are tied. Three votes susie, three votes bob.
if this last vote is a vote for sugar, we have a tie.
it is not a vote for sugar.
let's go in tight on suz sdpe bob, the winner of "survivor: gabon."
Bob's...
well "survivor: gabon" brought us one of the oldest and most likable survivors in history.
Bob the physics teacher from maine is a millionaire.
we will find out how he made that beautifulake idol.
and we will answer the question, is crystal really an olympic gold medal
and we will find out if corinne and sugar made up.
it is the "survivor: gabon" live reunion show in los angeles.
go
having
Bob, wins immunity.
Bob, bob, bob, bob, five straight challenges.
I'm almost 60 years old and I beat out everybody.
life doesn't get better than this.
we are back with the winner of "survivor: gabon.
57 years old, the oldest winner ever in the history of our game.
congratulations, bob.
can you wrap it up?
what was the key to you doing so well in this game?
I just tried to be necessary, tried to be friendly.
and I just was...
trying to play the game.
you are overwhelmed.
I am.
did you have a game plan coming in to try and stay in the middle?
my plan was to fly under the radar as long as I could.
be necessary and be a nice guy so that people would like me.
how important was that amazing fake idol you created?
that saved my...
my place in the game because I knew they were going to take me out, and they traded it for randy.
sorry, randy, but...
we're seeing a little footage of it there.
explain how you made that idol.
I think everybody they talked to was amazed.
it looked like something we would have on the show.
when-- I generally collected beads whenever they fell on the ground,
but when corinne said to me,"we're going to send you to exile island,
I reached down, picked up my canteen and my bag.
and yawned and reached up.
and there used to be a whole bunch of beads and berries and terrifickets on the kota flag
and I stripped them off off and put them in my pocket.
when I was out on my little walk-about, I found the base of it.
and I just sort of put it together with my
my mother was always good at art and she left me a little trick, and I just put two and two together.
one of the things they took a lot of grief for was throwing bob's beautiful fake immunity idol in the fire!
everybody's like,"why did you do that?
because that's what we do when somebody gets burned with a fake idol,
in this case, randy, it goes in the torch.
I did, however, offer guys all left, I did go in and pulled out what was left for you, bob.
I'll show you can we get a shot of this, michael?
this is-- these are the pieces-- by the way, where did you get this rope?
we don't give you guys anything.
I take stuff.
Wrnchlts did you get the rope?
when I got to exile island, it was the clue
I mean, the instructions rolled up, and it was tied with a piece of string,
and I untied the string and put it in my pocket.
that's how you do it. There you go. Your souvenir.
Bob, what's the reaction from your-- from your students?
you teach physics in maine.
what are they-- what do they think. The whole thing?
how do you relate all this to...
the joke is I have the largest group of illitteral survivor fans in america.
but they've been really great.
they've been really supportive, and they've enjoyed it.
I gotta-- do you-- you told me, actually, that you're trying to take some of the challenges
that you've done so well in and turn them into physics problems.
I've written three text messages,"if you do well, mr. Crowley,
do we have to take the test tomorrow? They do.
and the last question on the test-- I won't give them the numbers right now
but they've got to calculate if I throw a rock at 30 degrees at 14 meters per second,
they're going to have to calculate how far if the--.
that's based on the challenge where you threw balls over the
right, threw because over the cliff.
so you're taking the show, taking it into the classroom and saying let's make this a physics problem.
Yeah. - All right, nice.
I have a question for the jury.
in that fire-make challenge, had matty won instead of bob and the final three was
sugar, susie, and matty, how many people in the jury would have voted for matty?
that's a million-dollar fire-making challenge.
Matty and bob practiced.
why weren't you out there working that?
I didn't even see it coming.
I thought I was-- I got confident.
and when you get confident in survivor, you get in trouble.
and I thought I had it in the bag, and, obviously, I didn't.
let me just say-- I'm going to look right in the cam radio ra
if you end up on the show "survivor
go to rei buy a flint and practice making fire a little bit bah bauz it cost matty a million bucks.
I was never very good at homework.
Susie, I have one question for you, and as my friend says,"whenever you say with
no disrespect intended"-- it probably means there is some.
how did you get so far in the game?
how did you get three votes and nearly win this game?
I like to think that people liked me.
and I did, just like bob, was under the radar.
I was a hard worker.
I never wanted to hurt anybody's feelings.
and I really got luck wet two immunities I won.
the last one, if I wouldn't have won that, I wouldn't be sitting here right now.
I have to say I was shocked at the votes.
I was shocked, too.
as I was looking through them going,"another susie?
I thought, is he going to win this game?
here's what's going to blow your mind,
the deciding vote in tonight's vote turned out to be randy.
he was the hub of this all.
Randy, why did you not vote for susie and vote for bob?
easy. That cookie that didn't matter much.
they kept reminding me,"it's just a cookie.
it was a million-dollar cookie.
so you're talking about
because, susie, you gave randy a hard time about the whole cookie incident.
Yeah, I just was discussing it with him-- - discussing?
Bob uponed to know what happened when he came back from exile,
and sugar and randy were trying to tell them, and I told my perspective,
I thought he didn't want give him ray cookie.
apparently he was wrong. It upset randy.
I love the fact that we never get out of the sandbox.
a chocolate chip cooki now costs susie a million dollars.
Absolutely.
sugar, one of the more popular people on this season...
what has been the reaction on the street?
are people coming up to you? Is it hard to go out?
Yeah. I'm getting a lot of people coming up to me, and some people are thanking me for the randy cookie incident.
and I have to make sure that I feel like I'm in a good mood and have makeup on
before I leave because people are blogging about seeing me driving in my car.
you've become a superstar. You can't leave your house?
I-- well, you showed my license plate pretty much to everybody, so, yeah.
I have to leave my house with makeup on, that's all.
Really? That's-- I lost-- that's very impressive from "survivor,
that you're basically needing your own paparazzi guard.
Oh, yeah.
what-- what was it like having to deal with the recent loss of your dad
while going out and playing this incredibly taxing show emotionally?
well, I think pretty much anybody who has a heart,
understands that's probably why I was so emotional the whole time.
on, and it was a very hard game.
but I don't cry every day, people.
I'm okay now. I'm over it.
not over it, but I'm better. I'm stronger.
these guys made me stronger.
well, I think it's fair to say while you're very popular with the viewers,
you weren't as popular with some of the people on the show.
sugar certainly made some comes in gabon,
but this comment from corinne is one of the nastiest comments I have ever heard.
sugar, you are an unemployed, uneducated leach on society
and the only thing I would vote to give you is a handful of anti-depressants
so it would seem a little more sincere when you are crying your dead father.
thank you, everyone.
did corinne mean what she said? Does she regret it?
that is next on "survivor: gabon," the reunion show, live in los angeles.
I would rather serve poison to these people.
I don't like the way you've been talking negive.
she's going to teach me a lesson about life.
I want to kill sugar. I hate her.
I am going to be nasty at tribal.
you are an unemployed, uneducated leach on society
and the only thing I would vote to give you is a handful of anti-depressants
so it would seem a little more sincere when you are crying your dead father.
thank you, everyone.
I have heard some doozies.
that is at the top of the list.
regrets on that comment? What
uhm, it's hard to explain but it's like I
obviously, I feel sorry for her loss.
it was more that there are so many days with a person crying
and it's like being stranded in africa with a colicky baby.
I literally couldn't take it anymore. And I just--.
but not being able to take it is one thing.
making a conscious decision to make a comment about somebody's
the loss of somebody's father. - Yeah.
uhm, I guess I just had a lot of anger.
and thought this will really, you know, eye went for the jugular.
is that you? Is that what we saw out there?
well, I mean, in real life, if I didn't like somebody I just wouldn spend time with them.
but if you force me to spend time with someone you will probably push me to that.
Yes, that is me. That is not an act, that's me.
now, I gotta believe that corinne kind of likes the boos.
I love the boos. Keep them coming, people.
Marcus, what's the dionnect between so many people who watch the show liking sugar, and
she knot no votes. At the final.
and I know there's animosity still with her. What is it?
can you put your finger on it?
you know, it's hard to tell because you
you see these people on tv, and they see one minute out of every 300.
and I think that, like corinne said, we're all together.
we're all trying to love each other, but we all have different ways of expressing that,
ande also have different ways of expressing anger.
and I think, you know, sugar did a great job with the manages She was dealing with but a lot of times they bubbled over in ways
that rubbed people the wrong way and you might not see that on comrabut
that is what we were dealing with.
you mentioned corinne that you are irritateed with us wautz
because we didn't portray you in a more negative light.
I felt like for the first half the season I was like a wallflower.
no one knew who I was.
I was every bit the same person from day one as I was until day 33
what's interesting about your comment is most people complain about not being nice enough. - "you only showed the mean side.
I'm actually a nice person.
Corinne came to me and said,"I'm every bit as nasty as randy and you didn't show it.
I was like, I loved his edit. I thought it was so entertaining.
I loved the edit.
you're talking production speak. What do your friends and family say?
do the know you as this?
this is what I want to get at.
you walk around like this, no regrets?
I don't have any regrets about the show.
to me a lot of what I do is sarcasm, when i said dan was a former fatty tha was funny.
I wasn't actually going to stab susie in the face.
I wasn't looking for a knife.
it's an exaggeration. It's an outlet for me.
stand-up may not be the best career choice for you.
I'm going to conduct sensitivity training across erica now.
Corinne is not the only one known for her nasty comments.
bitter old randy will go down as one of the most colorful people to play the game.
if you get me you're not offended by me.
Sasquatch is big foot which is crystal.
if you don't get me, you go crying home to mamma.
you have made it a living hell.
shut the up.
Randy is an ass. He offends everyone.
I don't like any of these people.
I am the new king of gabon so I am going to burn this house down.
that's what's interesting is we come out to randy, and he gets applause.
Randy, same question-- is that you?
so you're just-- you are this bitter, bitter guy?
were you always this way? What makes you this way?
no, I wasn't always this way.
I used to be fun, happy, likable.
I had girlfriends.
people are laughing. But you're being serious.
Yeah. I mean... Yeah.
I haven't told a joke this entire season.
and life took a turn?
what-- we-- everyone wants to get underneath the veneer.
well, they're not going to.
I mean, you're either born with the ability or you're not.
the ability to what?
to like me.
that wasn't a joke! That wasn'a joke!
as further evidence what randy's talking about, for the last 15 years, best friend?
my dog.
Really? Friend?
Yeah, he never cheated on me.
never lied to me.
never cried every day.
he was awesome.
something else surprised me about you when I did a little research.
the highest i. q.of this whole bunch was marcus, off-the-charts high.
the second highest i. q.was randy.
I think there's a perception that, you know, you're
to use a phrase that maybe is inappropriate
you're this country kind of I don't really know what's what.
there's a lot to you.
the test has got to be flawed because...
I mean, with these einsteins here on the front row...
you're a commercial pilot? Is that true?
I used to be, yeah.
you run in iron man in hawaii.
I used to.
marathons. - Used to.
engineering degree from vanderbilt.
I cheated.
and the best part of all is tell me about who you brought to the live show.
of all the people in your life, you could bring.
six strangers. I've never met them.
and how did this come to be?
they're fans of the show. I've--, you know, i just know them as fans, and it would mean something for them to come
and some of my old friends from high school and college would love to be here
but they've never seen the show until I got on it.
Yeah, so they're out there, somebody, I don't know.
Randy, you applied to be on should foe 15 times.
worth the wait?
I could have been a lot funnier and a lot middle eastern.
for those of you who don't know, randy's career is
appropriately enough-- a wedding videographer.
so for those of you who have hired randy in the past to make your wedding videos,
this is the man behind them.
it was a pleasure-- oddly, it was a pleasure having you on the shows.
you're one of the most despicable and likable people that we've ever had.
thank you. - Charlie... Yeses.
Charlie, my question to you is you are one of the nicest guys we've ever had on the show.
you're nice through and through, and you were friends with these guys.
Yeah.
what's the deal?
Corinne is one of the nastiest people I've ever met, and you're friends with her.
I make friends with all these guys here, but I was particularly fwrendz these two.
what is it though?
you're somebody who saw something a lot of us didn't see.
I think what you're seeing in randy and what people like in randy i also see in corinne.
they also put up this wall sort of
this emotional wall, but there is a big heart behind both of them.
they're both wildly smart people interesting people.
if you respect them, they respect you back.
I was born to love randy and I was born to love corinne and we have so much fun together.
up this crystal really an olympic gold medalist?
and the accent that has so many people curious, ace, is it real or fake?
plus the most underestimated player in the game, kenny, and later,
sprint is awarding $100, 000 to the sprint player of the season.
but first, taking us to the break, our two composers david vannacor and russ landau.
I am a 2004 olympic gold medalist.
crystal takes a hard hit.
crystal really struggling for fang.
crystal once again off the course.
crystal back on the course.
I was in the game.
crystal in the water first.
I just wasn't participating as much as I normally do.
this challenge is nationally under way.
and after one second, crystal is out.
crystal, you talk about having a target on your back.
when you come on to this show billed as an olympic gold medalist in a show filled with challenges, huge expecting as.
but I gotta say, next to whether or not ace's accent is real, the most-asked question is,"crystal?
really, she's an olympic gold medalist?
can we see some proof?
Yes, you sure jeff.
I am an olympic gold medalist, okay.
here's my medal.
from the 2004 games.
I was a member of the 4 x 4 relay which won gold.
we're look at a shot of you right there.
so you are legitimized.- Yes.
then the next question, what happened?
you're an athlete.
you couldn't do anything out there.
I know.
Oh, jeff, those challenges were so hard.
I am built to run around a circle.
I am not built to run on lorkz run uphill, swim-- I am not a fish.
aye a runner, a horse, a gazelle.
those challenges they are hard.
did any of your friends from the olympics call you and say,"what is going on?
I have one of my closest friends here tonight
and she's an olympic medalist and called me up all the time, cristable, you suck.
Yes.
what about people on the street?
are they more or les forgiving?
they are-- they are actually more forgiving.
they're like put aside the whole athletic side of the side.
they said,"crystal, we love how you just tell eb autopsy," so that made up for it.
Dan you took a lot of grief out there.
it was probably a surprise to you when you watched the show
and saw what people were saying about you.
how do you deal with that?
you're kind of vulnerable on the show?
you're absolutely vulnerable in a way that you don't have in your everyday life.
you're taken away from your inner security circle.
I think you just have to remember who are you, and that's really all that matters.
and if you can remember who you are and you're confident about who you are,
I think every decision you make on a day-to-day basis is the important thing.
you got a round of applause for that.
Kenny, gamer.
this is the thing I want to know.
educate me about gaming because you were bill as a world-class, world champion gamer.
what is that-- give me some credentials?
basically, I would travel around the world and then play these tournaments,
and, you know there are tournaments where there's a chance for me to travel,
play video games and get some money.
I've got some sponsors, and i was able to make more than $50, 000 doing that for uuhm
I started playing games when I was a kid.
but, you know, I figured I could make a career out of it prayer while and support me through college--.
you're so charge. You just go on ask and on.
I like it.
I just didn' know who you were talking to.
what's the connection between playing those games and survivor, if there is one?
well, in the gaming community I'm nope for my thing
my thing called mind games, and I kind of put that to the "survivor,
just like to be able to manipulate players and try to make them do what I want them to do.
and vote my way. And I think that-- it did kind of help a bit.
what was your downfall in this game?
Oh, definitely I got cocky.
I was like-- I thought I was the hub of the world.
I thought, hey, I'm in charge. I thought it was a chess game.
you do this, you do that.
but no. Not everyone on "survivor" is a piece I can move.
they had their own head.
they had their own mind.
when I got cocky, that was definitely my downfall.
I thought I could run the game.
but once you get that choke in survivor
I'm a big fan, so everyone who ever got cocky and thought they could run the game thought it was-- It was a downfall for them.
love life update.
when you came on the show you said I haven't had a girlfriend in years, years.
has anything changed?
well, I've talked to some girls lately.
I mean, yeah, girls are actually finding me attractive, which is kind of weird.
but...
I mean, I want someone who likes me for me and not because I was on "survivor.
well, okay...
then what about beautiful michelle with whom you guys had a little something there, michelle.
you think I'm beautiful?
thank you, jeff!- Michelle, any chance with you and kenny?
you guys in your first-- in your only episode, had a nice little moment where you ate a termite for him.
now I have nightmares that this big termite is trying to meet me and he's wearing a fang
what do you call those things-- a buff.
he is wearing a fang buff and he's chasing me because I ate his daughter.
Kenny, maybe stay single.
I agree.
we love you, michelle.- I know.
ace, you've got to get this all the time.
but I want to put an end to it-- the accent.
some people said it was inconsistent thus raising the suspicion maybe it was not real.
I am from mississippi.
I was raised in london.
my parents are english and I lived there for eight years.
so my accent sort of stuck.
do you think something as simple as an accent could have affected nu this game?
completely.
I think in retrospect I should have
I have the worst imprsion of an american accent possible,
but I should have faked an american accent and had an english accent in confessional.
gabon was not easy and it would have been a lot tougher
without the help of the gabonese government, and they are here tonight.
we want to thank them because they made this whole season possible.
thank you, guys.
when we come back, we will catch up with the rest of the survivors
and find out who is going home with $100, 000 in their pocket.
first, let's take another look at some of the friends we made in gabon.
it's here in our camp, among us all day, because we hear them all day,
but you can't necessarily see them all the time but to actually see one
and put the face to the noise, I
well, since thursday, viewers have been texting in
and vote online for the sprint playerf the season, in other words,
they're voting for the survivor they like the best. The votes are in.
one of you is about to win $100, 000. 00
I'm going to tell you the top three vote-geters.
Matty is right.
Matty is one of the top three vote-geters.
Bob is one of the top three vote-geters.
and sugar.
is one of the top three vote-geters.
and if it were held in this audience, sugar would win , based on that applause.
I can tell you that matty is number three.
which brings us down to sugar or bob.
the survivors may not have liked you, but the audience definitely liked you.
unfortunately, they liked bob a little more.
Bob is the winner.
of the sprint $100, 000 player of the season, congratulations.
this has been a big night for bob.
and virtually no reaction.
somebody yank on that bow tie, see if bob is still awake.
it's got to be a compliment, not only to win the game but have people so happy you won
that they want to give you more money.
here, hold on.
let me answer,"yeah, it's really great and I just want to thank everybody for their support
and if you need to know how to tie a bow tie go to my web site, bob. Com from maine.
he's in shock.
Matty, give us an update on the love affair.
I love when the loved ones come.
some people don't like it.
you got engaged. Are you still engaged?
I'm still engaged.
we have a date.
we're completely on top of everything, the color schemes, the food.
everything's covered, and I may not have completed the game the way I necessarily wanted to,
but I did succeed in that, and that was probably the most important thing to me coming on the show--.
there she is, there's your fiance.
and you got her a ring because you made her a ring on location.
did you get another ring?
Yeah, when I got home I got hert-- the l. a.version.
so it was a little different, but it looks good.
they both look good.- Congratulations.
thank you.
Paloma, one of the things I thought was interesting you said as a result of being on this show
that you can do anything now.
you believe you can do anything.
Yeah, I do.
I feel every experience that you get in life, if you survive it,
you're just a better and stronger person, and "survivor" did that for me
and I think it did that for all of us.
I just feel anything that is thrown at me in life I can conquer,
and I believe that, and I believe everybody here has had a similar experience.
one of the youngest people on the show this season.
Yes.- What impact did this experience have for you?
what do you take back home with you?
everything.
the experience being with all these people.
usually I'm liked by everybody, but it was really hard to try to get along with all of these people
and be stuck in a hut and be the least liked player on the.
- I've grown so much.
and I appreciate everything, my family and everything a lot more.
G. c.the only person to ever go missing in action before a challenge.
you-- we were going to start that challenge without you, brother.
I'm telling you.
what happened?
uh, I was looking for a popeyes or something out there.
my stomach.
the player was hungry, man.
boy, it was hurting out there.
my stomach was talk tok me and I thought I have to jump on that boat and get something now.
I went to look for food.
Jacquie, the best experience of your life?
it was.
it was a great chance to step out of reality, step outside from the busy pace of life.
we were completely detoxed from technolo, and it gives you a great chance
to really reflect on what's truly important.
quickly, gillian, you applied more than anybody else.
was it worth it?
it was so worth it, jeff.
I have applied for years and years.
we are glad you made it on the show.
all right, find out where survivor is headed to next take a look at where here heading to next.
in the new year,"suvivor's" going to one of the most rugged locations yet.
the brazilian highlands.
two tribes will be stranded in the majestic interior of brazil for 39 days.
the only relief in the midst of this unforgiving land is a river oasis, the rio novembero.
scorching temperatures, torrential downpours, dangerous wildlife.
who will have what it takes to outwit, outplay, and outlast all the others?
find out on "survivor tocantins.
the brazilian highlands
tomorrow morning, bob will appear on the "early show" on cbs and receive his check for $1 million.
immediately following tonight's show you can bid on one-of-a-kind memorabilia
proceeds to benefit the serben teen projects.
if you have what it takes to be on the show, go to cbs. com.
we'd love to see you out there.
thanks for your loyalty.
good night.
this is Nicaragua:
remote, mysterious, dangerous.
straddled between the raging waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.
it's where ancient rain forests battle for survival against some of the world's youngest and most active volcanos.
this ruggedded landed has resisted taming and it is where 20 Americans have already begun the adventure of a lifetime.
everywhere you look there's monkeys hanging from things.
there's dangerous animals here.
it's like...It's real.
there's no fences like the zoo.
I'm Jimmy Johnson.
I'm 66 years old and I've won two Collegiate National Championships.
I've won two Superbowls.
what could top it off better than to win "Survivor"?
they think they've already been divideed into two tribes.
though they have not spoken, first impressions are already forming.
I notice the older gentleman looks like a mafia boss and he looks like he wants to boss people around and I'm not the kind of character that likes his buttons pushed.
there's an old gray-haired guy that's pissing me off already.
he seems like the kind of guy who's going to step into the leadership position.
I hope he does because he'll just kicked off right away.
forced to work together, they must learn to adapt or they'll be voted out.
I'm single. I am single, single, single. Very single.
and flirting is something I'm going to use if I have to.
in the end, only one will remain to claim the million-dollar prize.
39 days, 20 people, one survivor!
come on in, guys.
welcome to "Survivor: Nicaragua."
woman in the plaid, what's your name?
you've had a little bit of time to spend with these people.
can you tell things about people from the way they walk?
from the way they're looking at each other?
Yeah, absolutely.
you can tell a lot about a person not just the way they're walking but by the way they're watching other people.
I was born with a birth defect that forced the amputation of my right leg when I was six months old.
Kelly B. medical student
I think initially I'm keeping everything a secret.
I don't want people to make assumptions about my physical ability and that's what people do.
guy in the blue, what's your name? - Marty.
think you've picked up anything based on eye contact?
you can tell people are "this is my team, this is who I'm going to be with."
so people are checking each other out.
as I'm looking around the group right now, I see Jimmy Johnson, an N. F.L. Coach.
I want nothing to do with Jimmy Johnson in this game.
Marty technology executive
I have no idea why the hell he's even here.
and I'd rather have him on the other tribe, frankly.
you guys ready to get started?
Yes! - All right, here we go.
hidden somewhere down that Lagoon is a medallion of power.
the medallion of power could give you huge advantage in this game.
the person who returns wearing the medallion of power claims it for their tribe.
this is not an individual reward.
make sense? - Yes!
you can go any time if you want somebody's got to the run to the right;somebody's got to run to the left.
people are scattered everywhere looking for the medallion of power.
keep looking! Keep looking.
Oh, my god!
very good!
everybody head on back.
one of ours. - Yes, sir.
what a way to start.
I don't know your name but you did a great job!
guys, come on back in.
I noticed there was a girl with a limp.
she has darker brown hair and I couldn't tell what was up with it.
Alina art student
like, I think that she, like, maybe has, like, a hip problem?
but I don't know. I don't know what's going on with that.
Marty, what's your take on Brenda having the medallion of power?
I think it's a killer. It's important to win anything thrown at us and to be the tribe to win the first thing, I think bodes really well for us.
it would be great if it were that way.
unfortunately, Marty, this is not the way the tribes are going to be divided.
we're now going to divide into tribes.
if you are 40 and older you're over here.
Hey! Hey!
if you are 30 and younger, you're over here.
damn, man, I wanted the old football coach, man!
Oh, god! - Jimmy Johnson!
divide it up! Let's go.
young guns!
I'm young at heart!
Oh, man! The older ones here, the younger one there is.
I was looking forward to some of those young people carrying me.
Jimmy J. former NFL coach
I don't want any of the old people with me.
when the switch came, my first thought was oh, damn.
chase pro face car Jackman
the antiques have the best coach you could ask for.
they've got a Super Bowl winning coach on their team.
he's a great leader. That's what he's done the whole life.
older tribe, you are Espada.
you're wearing blue.
younger tribe, you're called La Flor, you're wearing yellow.
put your buffs on.
make it official.
where do you put it?
I think it can go on your head - I'll have toes me up my hair.
it's going toes me up far while anyway.
Brenda, you won the medallion of power for your tribe.
you don't know how much power it has, all you know is that it is for your tribe.
but you're going to have to make a decision.
you can hold on to this unknown power and get a chance to use it later in the game or you can trade it right now for fire in the form of flint and a crate full of fishing gear.
you've got mask, fins, line, hooks and a spear to go along with it.
so as a tribe here's what you're deciding.
do you keep power in the game or do you give it up for a quick start back at camp?
what you don't keep the other tribe gets.
Yeah.
okay.
I say we keep it because the longer we stay in the more opportunities we're going to have.
keep it.
the medallion threw everything for a loop.
I want to keep it.
I like the fact that it's power. Power.
Naonka P. E.teacher LA FLOR YOUNGER TRIBE - I hope they keep it. - I do, too.
fire and fish.
fire's going to be so important early.
decide, children.
all right, let's...Dude, we've got to fish.
do we want fire or fish, dude?
what's the desnigs are you going to keep power or so here's what you're deciding:
do you keep power in the game or are you going to trade it for the fishing gear?
we're going to take the fishing gear.
all right, Brenda, take it off and give it to somebody on the other tribe.
older tribe, you'll get a chance to play that medallion of power at some point later in the game.
we got power, whatever it means.
we'll find out.
and it's gold.
don't winners carry gold?
Espada, head out that way, La Flor, head out that way.
I figure the old people need the medallion of power more than we do.
I don't want to underestimate the old people but I don't think they'll be able to handle some challenges.
there's no reason why we should lose to them.
shannon pest control co. owner LA FLOR YOUNGER TRIBE
Espada OLDER TRIBE DAY1
just call me Jimmy. - Oh, man!
all the adventures I've had in the past, I was in charge.
I can fire players, I could recruit players, I could sign them.
out here I don't have the control.
so we've got to get the floor of the shelter.
maybe somebody's going to be infatuated with me being head coach Jimmy Johnson Superbowl winner.
well, I'll play on that.
I'll flay superstar status.
you walked in and I was like, hey, that's Jimmy Johnson.
some of these other players may resent that.
maybe they're Philadelphia Eagle fans or wWashington Red Skin fans.
do you think that's him? - That's Jimmy Johnson.
but that can't be the Jimmy...
Jimmy Johnson was the coach of the Miami Dolphins...
and Dallas Cowboys.
that's him.
so I've got to work on each particular contestant to win them over because if I don't I'll be a target and they'll vote me out early.
I really like you.
the first time I saw you I got a good feeling about that and I trust you.
and me, too. - I trust you , too.
you know what?
I agree. - Okay. I'm with you all the way.
back in south Dakota coaching the swim team you have to deal with a lot of different personalities
Holly swim coach Espada older tribe and you still have to hold your composure at the same time.
so I'm very good judge of people.
listen, I want you to know, You got my word.
the first time I saw Wendy I trusted her and most of the time I do read people very well.
you have my word.
Holly said she wanted to be in an alliance with me and I thought that was awesome but I wasn't expecting it so soon.
Wendy goat rancher Espada older tribe
I don't know if I'm naive.
my brother calls me sheltered and that's kind of like naive.
I got three!
this is my third!
being a goat rancher, you're with a lot of goats, you don't meet a lot of people.
my strategy from the beginning of the game is take baby steps first, not be the first person voted off.
my husband thinks I'm going to be the first person voted off because he thinks I talk a lot.
so I think I'm going to bite my tongue and hide my true self from the tribe meats.
Wendy Jo, where are you from?
from Montana.
and you like horses?
I do!
she's a little weird.
we got fire now.
we'll have fire now. - Okay.
Oh, yeah, you got that.
I can do it. - Who's got the glasses.
they think I'm some middle aged housewife that toot les around the house all day long, they here in for a big surprise.
because that's definitely not me
Jane dog trainer Espada older tribe I need to get it really concentrated right on that small spot.
I'm 56 years old and I'm the type person that stays busy all the time doing things.
I just don't think there's anything I can't do.
where there's smoke there will be fire.
winning the million dollars is real important to me because it will help me pay off my farm and the fact that I lost my husband in '09, it means I would haven't to work as hard as I do.
but his spirit I know is still with me.
and that's what keeps me going.
there you go! There you go! Here you go!
fire!
keep it going, guys.
Jane, you rock!
is that friction or glasses? - Glasses, baby.
glasses, honey. - Killer.
they gave up the medallion and what did they get
Marty technology executive Espada older tribe Jane started the fire literally within half an hour.
the fact that we made fire that quickly, it reassured us all that you know what?
we're going to take this thing.
Espada rules!
we've got just as much going for high fives all around.
la FLOR younger tribe day1
Benry. - Benry?
nice to meet you guys.
this game that's old guys versus young guys, we know we're going to be able to dominate.
sash real extate broker La Flor younger tribe
great beach, great waves, beautiful girls.
doesn't get much better than that, right?
do we have a machete?
we have one right here.
we can catch rainwater and all kinds of stuff.
jud student La Flor younger tribe
as soon as we saw 30 and under it was like these are my people!
this is going to be a lot of fun.
you look like you'd be good in the water. - Or not.
damn, that was there!
the guy with the long blond hair, he's a dumb blond.
shannon pest control co. owner La Flor younger tribe
I mean, I never really called a guy a dumb blond before but he's a dumb blond.
Damn!
Blond-head kid, the one that looks like Fabio.
dude, he's just retarded.
we've got to get more bamboo.
you're Fabio, you go get it.
all right.
the name Fabio, man, I didn't even realize I was being called that at first.
I'm going to go help Fabio.
do that, he needs it.
dude is an idiot, damn.
Fabio, like, rides a white horse and does butter commercials and is kind of a cheese ball.
whatever. Dude, I don't care what they call me.
I'm gonna win the million dollars so I guess my mick name's Fabio.
okay, look, I feel that me and you will be the strong nest challenges.
without me and you I think they're screwed.
you and I are definitely going to be the strongest as far as just strength wise.
we may not be the best swimmers or something.
I won't be the best swimmer but strength wise any kind of athletic ability wise...
that's a target on our back.
you're right because they see alpha males being targeted.
that's what's good about me and you sticking down to number two.
rob and Russell could have it last year.
I don't know about you but I don't want another girl to win it.
exactly.
it's important we don't let girls take over.
we already get owned in marriage.
pretty soon we'll have a woman president.
I mean, a guy needs to sack up and we need to win this one.
so being an a. P.T.every time I notice people looking down at the ground I thought they were looking at my leg and my foot about what about my pants?
I was paranoid that people were just staring at my leg.
I was definitely thinking they were suspecting something was different.
so I guess I'm going to have to just show it to everyone and so that's my goal is to make sure that I come out with it and am able to prove immediately that I am as physically capable as everyone else.
I want to say something to everyone.
what's up? - Can we group?
group meeting, guys. - We got tree mail?
no, no, I kind of called the group meeting.
we already have first impressions, got on the know each other so I think at this point I'm pretty comfortable with my team, right?
right.
wait, I'm confused. - Well...
prosthetic. - I knew it!
I knew it, too.
all right, now I am excited.
what happened?
I had a birth defect.
you are a rock star.
all right. Cool.
I've always been fascinated on how those things work.
how do you tell it to move?
she does have a thigh.
being that I'm such a was I could almost cry.
if I went to the final three with her or two I'd be like just give her the money.
just cut her the check because no money in the world can replace what she's possibly gone through in her life.
but really she's going to be too big of a threat down the road.
sympathy vote no doubt.
so I figure we lose a challenge to the old folks, she's got to be one of the first ones to go.
so Kelly B. has one leg and I don't want people getting mad at me because I talk about her leg but it's a game.
we're in the title of survivor plus a million.
so I'm not going to treat you as an outcast.
where Applebee's 2 for 20
Espada
guys, fire, I mean, seriously. That's.
I overdid it, I think, when we were getting all the wood and getting all the bamboo and everybody was so excited to get here and start working on stuff.
I just...
I think I did more than I needed to do.
coach needs to be careful.
he's getting his as kicked out here now.
I don't know he's going for an academy award or if he's genuinely ill.
but this is not for the weak and he's not a young man.
Espada
zero sleep, sick throwing up, ants and mosquitos biting me everywhere, and cold and shivering until the sun came up.
I don't think I've ever had a 24-hour period where I was in that much discomfort and that miserable.
I've watched every second of "Survivor."
I never imagined anywhere close that it was this difficult.
first time I've ever experienced anything like this and it's an eye opener, I promise you.
la Flor
did you know Jimmy Johnson.
I didn't know him before this but... - Oh, my god.
did you know it was him?
well, I used to cheer for the Dolphins so...
I like your spirit.
I like you, too. - Okay, good.
I absolutely... I thought that from the beginning.
everything's just...
you can make an alliance right now and then you get in a challenge and end up hating that person.
I don't think I'm going to hate you.
I'm not talking about you and me, just in general.
Brenda, she's a cute girl. I'm attracted to her.
I for some reason really trust her.
first thought you could come in and do...
guys want to get girls out or something. That's crazy.
what if one of the guys is weak and you don't want to have her around?
I don't want to have this thing where I have two different alliances.
I'm not trying to come on here and lie to everybody but my dumb ass and put my neck on the line early and I was not planning on doing that.
but I made that alliance with Shannon and now I've got to figure out who I can really trust.
sometimes you don't have to say anything.
I agree. - We just know.
I'm kind of use odd to having guys do what I say.
what's funny is Chase came up and told me the guys have an alliance going on and of course I'm going to use that information to get me to the end.
I know Chase trusts me.
he's a really nice guy but he's clueless.
that looks like a well.
all right.
this is a clue to a hidden immunity idol.
it is up to you whether you share this information with anyone else.
decipher the clues to find the hidden immunity idol.
what do you want to do?
Oh, gosh, well, we keep it between us for sure. - I think so.
especially this early.
this is a map?
I never realized how hard these are.
we just found the clue to a hidden immunity idol.
this early the game.
but we can't figure it out.
so we're trying to decipher what the clues mean.
they're not easy. - We're stumped.
so we're thinking we're just going to hold on to it and maybe come back to it.
let's - Will you remember where it is? - Yeah.
Kelly B. and I...
it's kind of hard right now because we found the hidden immunity idol clue together which I wish we didn't find it together so now I'm kind of forced to be in an alliance with her and I don't want her to stick around for a long time because...
I mean, I don't want to go to the end with her because, I mean, or troy say it but sympathy vote for sure and I'm not trying to go up against that.
Espada - Okay! - Treemail!
change the course of waterfalls or you may just lose your claim.
keep your mind in the gutter or be the first to leave the game.
so can we give ourselves any advantage with that?
this is a very stressful time on these people.
it's a very stressful time on me.
we understood dogs, the older folks and they need motivation.
everybody in this world needs motivation and I think I can help motivate this team.
okay, folks, team huddle.
first of all, the reason why I'm here is here for the adventure because there's no way in the world a jury's going to give me a million bucks. I know that.
but the thing that I can do, I can help somebody win a million bucks.
and the winner can come from one of you guys.
nothing would make me happier than to see one of you win a million bucks.
and I'll help you all the way. I promise you.
just as long as we're psyched up for it and we know what we've got to do, - we'll kick their ass. All right? - All right!
I just got a pep talk from Jimmy Johnson!
come on in, guys.
Halt! - La Flor!
okay.
older tribe. They came in sort of either serenading you or maybe that was a war cry.
Jimmy? Any impact?
I really don't concentrate on what they do.
we know what we have to do.
Jud, what do you make of the older tribe?
Jeff, his name is Fabio, not Judson.
his name is Fabio. - He's the man.
let's figure out. Kelly, are you going to go by Kelly in purple and blond hair what are you going by?
purple Kelly.
purple Kelly. All right.
Tyrone, when you see somebody on the other tribe like kelly with one artificial leg, does that make you think "I've got to take it a little easier on her"?
not at all. This is a competition, we're all operate big the same rules and we're going to win.
all right. For today's immunity challenge one person will be at the top of a tower pouring water while five other tribe members will use sections of gutter to direct that water into a barrel.
once the barrel fills, a large bag of puzzle pieces will drop.
the four remaining tribe members must then use those pieces to solve the puzzle.
first tribe to get it right wins immunity.
if you have immunity in your possession, you can not be sent home.
the losers of this challenge will go to tribal council where the first person will be voted out.
all right. Now to the medallion of power.
older tribe, you guys have this medallion, you don't know what kind of power it possesses.
here's how it works.
the medallion of power gives you huge advantage at challenges.
if you use it today, you will start this challenge with one bucket of water already in your barrel.
given that it takes about five buckets to fill, this is a significant advantage.
if you use it, then the medallion goes to the younger tribe and they will have an opportunity to use it at the next challenge.
I'm going to give you a minute to strategize.
I don't think that's enough.
this type of a challenge we can compete with them no problem.
let's make a statement.
let's make a statement and hold on to it.
so we're keeping it? - Yeah. Okay.
older tribe, what's it going to be. You going to use it or not?
we're going to keep it.
all right. Older tribe opting to keep the medallion of power.
give you a minute to strategize. We'll get started.
okay. It is the first immunity challenge in "Survivor: Nicaragua," old versus young.
for immunity.
survivors ready.
go.
set it up! Set it up! Set it up!
the task is very simple:
one person pours water down the gutters into the barrel once your barrel is full, the puzzles will drop.
go, baby! Go!
don't spill it! - Very close! Very close.
you're doing great, guys, keep it steady!
fast! Fast!
younger tribe has a nice flow.
slow and steady. Don't waste it.
just like that. - Little slower.
I got it.
slow and steady, everything you can get.
that's good. A steady flow.
older tribe with a great flow.
come on, guys! Keep it going! Keep it going!
come on, Holly!
keep it going!
keep it going, keep it going!
younger tribe releases their puzzle pieces.
let's go, girls, keep it going.
don't panic.
go, go!
older tribe released their puzzle pieces.
let's go! Let's go. - You got it!
both tribes working on their puzzle.
we are very even in this first challenge.
it's going to come down to four older women, four younger women.
will bit wisdom or enthusiasm that will win this challenge?
look at the buff, guys!
young tribe off to a quick start.
look at the buff!
older tribe now getting something going.
older tribe, you need to pick it up!
come on!
almost there!
younger tribe getting very close!
what's not right? Something's not working.
leave that!
older tribe now back in it.
immunity on the line.
somebody going home tonight!
fit it in!
younger tribe wins immunity!
younger tribe, congratulations.
nobody going home from the younger tribe.
Brenda, would you have used that medallion of power?
Yes, definitely.
because you're here to win, so why take chances when you're doing it right now?
why are you thinking about tomorrow or the next day when you're playing right now?
all right. Older tribe, I'll see you tonight at tribal where somebody will be the first person voted out of this game.
grab your stuff and head on back to camp.
I remember my second Superbowl we lost the first two ball games.
but we were able to keep going and we hung in there and, of course, won the Super Bowl.
losing the first challenge, it's not the end of the world.
just make sure we make a smart decision, get rid of the weakest player and still have the medallion, still have a strong team.
I don't know
let's see what's going on.
I don't know, I can't even think clearly right now.
I'm junkd from the trauma of the challenge.
I need to sleep.
I want to lay down.
I'm 48 years old, but this place already knocked me down, it's only day three.
so I've got to learn to deal with that and I've got to figure out how to play the game.
Jimmy T. What are you thinking?
I think Jimmy's trying to horn swag l everybody, telling everybody I really care about you, I want to make you a million dollars.
so anyway, I'm voting Jimmy tonight.
I'm just... - What do you think?
I've got to say this.
I'm not going to not be heard here. - Okay.
I'm not going to not be heard. - Okay, all right, I'm listening, I'm listening.
I know.I know that sometimes stars blind people.
I'm totally with you.
I've got to call him down.
nobody wants to be the first one to go home.
whoever it is, you know, we all got to decide to take out the weakest player.
and that makes the team stronger.
so who do you think is the weakest player?
I think it's either myself or Wendy. Personally I think it's Wendy.
I mean, how is this team going to get stronger?
forget about personalities. Forget about alliances.
what makes... - You really mean that?
I really do. I mean it.
coach explained that we need to keep our team stronger and I agree with him.
and that's something I should have thought about before I rushed into the alliance with with Wendy.
this game we just don't know.
I mean, but you ask yourself, does...
does the team get stronger without wendy?
I'm really caught in a dilemma because I shook her hand and gave her my word. So...
I really don't know. I'm just going to see what happens.
here's the question, though...-- And the pot's not going to set well.
I look nervous and concerned probably because I am nervous and concerned.
well, I don't know if I'm nervous but I'm concerned because I think I'm on the outs because I don't think of I developed a bond with a lot of the people.
you going to come out? - No, I'm going to go back up.
all right.
you shouldn't trust anyone in "Survivor" that's true.
Holly won't even talk to me and she told me...
we shook on an alliance the first day. So...
I'm thinking heck, what's going on is all I want to know.
here's what Jimmy said to me.
he said at this point in the ball game you know, we should focus on...
strength and alliances are broken all the time.
he said there's two weak players.
did he include himself in that.
the other? - Wendy
so who do you think keep this is tribe strong?
I'm not...I don't know. What do you...
I don't know at this point what to think.
I don't think either one of them is a bad choice.
why don't we around go around the circle and honestly say who you'd rather.
does that sound fair?
Yeah. - Sounds good.
sounds good to me. - Sound good.
what do you think?
this is what I think.
I'm of the opinion that we need to keep the tribe strong.
this is the first time that we've had to really feel each other out for something as important as who's going to go home and you try to coax it out of people, you're getting tentativeness, nervousness about anybody saying a name.
so what do we say? I don't know?
it could a be a real toss between Wendy Jo and Jimmy Johnson.
we don't know how either one could really perform in a physical challenge.
we're making some hunches here.
we're making some guesses and Wendy Jo probably doesn't add a lot on the physicality side of the challenges.
and I think just because you're Jimmy Johnson and you're telling me the jury's not going to give you the million dollars, I'm not buying it.
it will be interesting. You have to see how this thing behind each of you is a torch.
go ahead and grab the torch and approach the flame.
dip in the and get fire.
this is part of the ritual at tribal council because in this game fire represents your life.
as long as you have fire, you're still in the game.
when your fire's gone, so are you.
well, welcome to tribal council.
so let's talk about first impressions.
Jane, what is typically the first impression people have when they meet you?
they might call me a southern hillbilly.
I call her "Survivor" Mcguyver because within an hour of hitting the beach Jane had the fire going.
she can do anything here.
Jane, did you know you could do it?
hell, yeah, I knew I could do it.
because I saw an article that you wrote and it said "why would anybody come and play "survivor" that didn't know how to make a fire?"
you listened to something I said?
I took it to heart, too, because I practiced for two months.
Jimmy T. how big were those first few moments for you in making first impressions?
it's unbelievable. Where I do come from I'm a leader.
when I talk, people listen.
when you get to "survivor," there's people that are stronger, there's people with more integrity and when you have one of the greatest leaders in the N. F.L. of all time, it's very frustrating. I'm just another player here.
Jimmy, when you hear something like that, do you feel a little target on your back that people will either look to you for leadership or be annoyed that you are a leader?
let me make it clear, I'm not the boss.
but, yeah, I'm going to be a target every single tribal council. I know that.
but I'm not a threat to anybody here for the simple reason no jury's going to award me a million bucks. I know that.
I'm not here for the money, I'm here for the adventure.
but I'll only be here as long as I can help this team be successful.
Jimmy T, can you buy that?
no way, he's going to try to win this thing.
and I think he can win the game because if he leads so well and deserves the win the game, the jury's going to let him win that game.
Marty, just a minute brings up an interesting point.
most people on "survivor" are born leaders.
is that a shock for you to get used to as well?
I think coming into it you have to be careful about being over the top leader because typically that puts a target on your back right away.
so I think there's different ways to lead and it's making sure you don't lead in the way that gets you into trouble.
let's talk about tonight's vote.
who here by a show of hands truly thinks they're in trouble.
marathon half the tribe.
Holly, why are you concerned it might be you tonight?
I made an alliance right into the game and coach came over to me after the challenge and he feels like there's two weak links.
well, I don't know if I necessarily agree with who he decides. So.
definitely.
Wendy, why do you think the tribe would want to vote you out tonight?
I don't feel like I connected very well with the people here.
I was very busy but some people talked at the camp and I didn't feel like I got a lot of that.
because they would be quite surprised if someone asked me some questions.
there's nobody here that even knows my age.
not one person asked me. - I asked you.
no, you didn't. - That's one question I never ask anyone.
no, you never asked me!
you're not supposed to ask a woman her age.
how old are you? - 48.
you look so young.
Wendy, typically the one question you wouldn't ask a woman is "how old are you."
so it's interesting that that's the question that as you tweaked.
it doesn't have me tweaked, I just found it interesting that nobody asked me.
maybe I'll start tooting my horn.
maybe that's what I should do.
maybe I should have been talkative and share everything.
but I didn't want to come in talk, talk, talk, and drive people crazy because people don't like people who talk all the time.
so I stayed pretty quiet and that is not me.
I have a nickname of chatter box.
all right. It is time to vote.
you're up. - Can I say one thing?
Wendy, you had something else you wanted to say?
I would also like to tell the group I think there's a lot that I can bring through my strength, my leadership.
I could be very friendly, very honest, very funny, fun to be with, strong willed, strong physically.
people like to be my friend.
people like to be with me.
they trust me all the time. Trust is important.
and I don't have any blisters on my feet and that's an asset.
that will help.
just a little thing I'd point out.
I think that's about it.
I just want to make sure you get everything off your chest.
that's it.
all right. Let's get to the vote.
Jane, you're up.
initially the decision was tough but after hearing you speak tonight with your excuses, it became easy. Wendy, you gotta go.
I'll go tally the votes.
once the votes are read, the decision is final.
the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
first vote, Wendy.
Eve. That's one vote Eve, one vote Wendy.
Wendy. Two votes Wendy.
Wendy. That's three votes Wendy.
Wendy, that's four votes Wendy.
Wendy, that's five votes Wendy, one vote Eve.
first person voted out of "Survivor: Nicaragua,"
Wendy. That's six, that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
Wendy, the tribe has spoken.
well, tonight's vote was clearly designed to improve the chemistry of this tribe.
one good thing about coming to tribal council, you will leave here with fire.
here's your flint.
grab a torch, head back to camp. Good night.
next time on "Survivor."
fatigue makes the minds get week.
new york city boy Danny - let's just fill his shoes up and then...
why you raising your voice at me? I can get loud, too.
I don't like anything about him.
he gets on my nerves.
21 seasons of "Survivor," never had an opening question open that much whoop fair. And what I find interesting is this is probably the only time in my life I was a loser with strangers.
I changed coming into the game.
if I would have been myself it would have worked out better.
drop your buffs.
we are switching tribes.
after a surprise switch, the young and old were combined but on each tribe, the young adopted a feisty older mom to get the upper hand.
I love your energy.
the Espada you thpicked up Holly.
100% I'm on board.
and the La Flor kidspicked up Jane.
I'm as thick as peanut butter and jelly with the younger La Flor tribe.
that left every one else north of 40 in the cold.
we've been dealt a very bad hand.
then an even bigger surprise sent both tribe sreeling.
both tribes are going totribal council.
both tribes will vote somebodyout of this game.
at La Flor, Brenda and Sash were in complete control.
they wanted the flush out Marty's hidden immunity idol and blind side kelly B.
if everything goes according to plan, we'll be able to kill a couple birds with one stone.
at tribal council, Sash and Brenda were sure that Marty would play his idol.
if anybody has a hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
but he shocked them by holding on to it.
Marty's gamble paid off becausehe kept his idol and kelly B. went home.
Kelly B.the tribe has spoken.
now Marty and his ally Jill are two against five.
at the Espada tribal council, the youth had to decide between Yve, whose strength could help them in challenges, or Dan who because of his bad knee would never be a threat.
once the votes are read the decision is final.
the person voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council immediately.
I'll read the votes.
Yve's strength was her undoing.
Yve, the tribe has spoken.
13 are left, who will be voted out tonight?
ESPADE NIGHT 15
what a day! - 13 left.
thank you, honey.
thank you. - Welcome.
we love you, Dan.
they used to call John Gottithe Teflon Don because everytime they'd try to get him on something it could never stick.
I feel like Teflon Dan.
at tribal council we discussedthe original plan and vote Yve out tonight.
but I'm a little bit worried about Dan's performance.
it will definitely be a hardpill to swallow if Dan costs us the challenges.
but we've made our decisions, we've made our beds and we'vegot to lay it n it.
Dan's not near as much of a threat once we get to the merge.
right now...
what we have to do next
what is Alina's out.
Alina is strong and she'svery smart.
from day one she had these eyes that can just see straight through you.
I never trusted her at all.
so we need to get Alina out next and that's for sure.
all right? -Can.
can I just say wow?
la FLOR NIGHT 15
why didn't you tell us Kelly B?
why didn't you tell us Jane?
we would have gone with whatever you guys would have said.
we wanted to flush the idol was the plan but...why any vote on me.
what were the votes on me?
what was that?
you have the idol.
Marty TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE LA FLOR TRIBE
you've got to have big, big kojones to pull the move that I pulled tonight which is that I do not play the immunity idol.
I sensed you guys wanted to flush the idol but something in my gut said that that wasn't totally bull so I kept that immunity idol in my pocket and I debated long and hard and something told me hang on to it and I was right.
I also need to get to the bottom of Jane.
obviously Jane voted for me tonight so that's going to have to be dealt with.
I'm just sitting here see thing about Jane, actually.
I've never lied to her once, I've never misled her, I've never voted for her.
she turned on me.
she's a desperate one and she has been from the beginning and she's got to go.
she's next.
she's pissing me off.
la FLOR DAY 16
one thing I wanted to say after last night to you is...actually, like three things.
one is I have never, ever lied to you.
unless you tell me right now you think I've lied about something, I'll set it straight right now.
I have never, ever once lied to you.
I've never misrepresented myself to you in this game. Not even once.
I've never written your name down and I have never, ever suggested that your name should go down.
they all told us you were going but when I saw everything turn, that's why I turned to you and said "vote for brenda"
because I was like this whole thing is going haywire.
I didn't know where it was going.
I felt like they had turned on us so I'm not really clear on what all their strategy was.
I think they wanted to flush the idol out.
two, they wanted to get rid of Kelly B. but they were worried that Kelly B.
had maybe come and talked to us and that we would use Kelly B. to flip on that.
be a foursome. - Right.
and we had no idea, I never, ever had a clue.
I never had a clue.
not an iota.
well, I want to know that because I don't think you voted for Brenda and I think you wrote my name last down, so...
that's what I think happened, right?
pretty sure, Jane.
I talked to Jane today. I'dont know if I should have.
you did?
Yeah, I was like I've never written your name down, ever.
and then I was like,"You know, I think you wrote my name down."
and she's like,"ha ha ha ha!"
and then just walked away.
Kelly B. going home buy Smarty and I another three days here.
I'm hoping that Jane will be next but Marty and I are really like scrambling around from behind the 8-Ball to try and stay here.
Jill ER DOCTOR LA FLOR TRIBE

grab your stuff, head back to camp.
Kellys. Nursing stdudent La Flor tribe
reward was for a horse backride and breakfast and you get to milk your own milk I guess.
I don't know. I don't know if that's sense.
you get to milk your own milk and that sounds amazing.
we should have won.
and we should be going because
la Flor day 17
we lost the reward but it makes you get up and do things and keep going and the word quitis not in my vocabulary.
I mean, I go at it all day long.
I'm a farmer girl and farmer girls have a strong heart and a strong will.
I can do a whole lot more than Marty and Jill ever thought I could do so I'm trying to stay in the good graces of the four tribe members that I have made friends with over at the La Flor team.
so, you know, they can lounge around, that's okay.
Jane dog trainer La Flor tribe
as long as they feel I'm important.
I'm gonna go check thoes lines over yonder, first.
just led me know when, uh...when you need me.
I don't care what they do right now.
I'm not going to tell them to get off their lazy little asses.
let them sleep.
let them sleep, let them relax.
as long as we win challenges, that's all I care about.
she's a master fisher woman so...I know!
hopefully she comes back with something big.
the older people who came over from Espada can work their butts off, feed me all day long and, you know, they'll help me get stronger. So I love it.
sash real esate broker La Flor tribe
you know, I get to stay at home all day, relax, eat the fruits of their labor while they go out, they work hard.
you know, I give them a lot of credit but, you know, this is a game and, you know, long run for me who stays in this game isn't a matter of how hard you work around camp, it's about how loyal you are to me.
hopefully, fingers crossed, we'll get fish today.
God this makes me miss home right here.
we won reward and we showed up, it was unbelievable.
I grew up on a horse farm in Florida and since my dad passed away we stopped having horses in our barn
chase race car Jackman La Flor tribe and that was just amazing for me.
all the emotions and everything.
you get a lot of time to reflect on stuff that you miss and I really, really miss my dad.
just being here, the first reward that I get was being able to spend it on a horse which was just unbelievable because it just reminded me like, god, he's just here, he's with me.
and it was just an unbelievable feeling because I miss my dad.
that was awesome!
that's why we're gonna keep winning.
welcome to our farm.
first thing we're going to do is milk the cow.
it's really easy but probably you haven't tried before.
never.
what you do is peres on the top and then you squeeze down.
so who wants to try first?
here goes nothing.
let's go. Come on, Dan!
I think I was... I think I went on a date with her.
all right, Nay, give it a shot.
see what you got, Nay.
Oh, while they feel so swollen.
you can do it, Nay.
Nay's not a farmer girl.
do it with your hand.
I am not a farm person.
I don't milk animals.
I don't play with animals nipples trying to get milk out.
Naonka P. E teacher La Flor tribe
okay, I'm over it.
but it was okay because I could say that I touched a cow's nipple.
it worked!
he who doesn't fish with me shouldn't get all the riches.
I've been up since 5: 30 working all day to catch fish.
I'm starving.
I want me a fish.
I'm gonna eat this one I just caught.
I think I deserve it.
but if I'm going to cook this sucker, I've got to go hide in the woods.
I don't know how safe that is at the moment, but I'm going to try.
they're going to be wondering where I'm at.
never cook add catfish like this, but I'm starving and I think out of all the fish that I've caught I deserve this one.
and I'm not going to take him back to camp and argue with anybody.
you know, they sat me out on the last challenge and they lost the food reward.
well, that's my food reward.
for all my hard work.
this is the first thing I've done behind anybody's back other than vote for Marty.
but I'm going to dig into this thing right now and see if it is done and I don't care if it's black.
fresh cheese made on the farm.
Oh, gosh!
unbelievable!
when I saw the food that was prepared on the table
this is what I've been waiting for - Not eating for 16 days and seeing food, I actually started to shake.
watermelon I just love it.
this can't be happening.
Alina and Chase, you both called our camp home.
it's home.
we take for granted sitting down and having a meal together, we've been together for how many days and the six of us sitting down and being so appreciative of a meal, it was... it became very emotional for a lot of us.
incredible.
after 17 days of not eating and not being with family or anything I mean...
we're kicking ass, y'all, we're doing this.
I'm glad you feel me on this emotion thing
I mean, I don't even know what's happening. I'm not emotional.
Alina's so grimy, she's so grimy and so sneaky.
I think she got emotional because she's trying to keep herself in a game but I can put on a show like Alina.
I have been playing a role, we have been getting close, you know?
this is all part of my plan.
next thing you know you're going to be walking away and your Espada.
come on in, guys!
all right, first things first, I will take back the individual immunity necklaces.
thank you.
individual immunity no more.
once again tribal immunity is back up for grabs.
let's get to today's challenge.
standing at the top of a tower, two members of each tribe will roll cannon balls down a long, steep chute while four other members will use ropes in an attempt to aim the chute trying to break one of the other tribe's tiles.
first tribe to break all five of the other tribe's tiles wins immunity and is safe in this game.
losers goes go to tribal council where the eighth person will be voted out of the game.
la Flor, you have one extra person, cannot sit out the same person in Back-To-Back challenges and Jane sat out the last challenge.
who's it going to be?
I'm going to sit out, Jeff.
sash gonna sit out. Take a spot on the bench.
everybody else I'll give you a minute to strategy and we'll get started.
up top for Espada Benry and Alina.
on the ropes for Espada Chase, Holly, Naonka and Dan.
up top for La Flor: Brenda and purple Kelly.
on the ropes, Jill, Marty, Jane, Fabio.
here we go.
all right, pull it up.
watch out. Hold on.
lower it down. - Chase and Holly, a little lower.
takes some work to move these ropes around.
Marty, up please.
okay, stop.
nay and Dan pull a little more.
right there. Right there.
there are three levels you can shoot from in this challenge.
all right. - Do this one.
has it lined up.
Where's Benry going to drop the ball? He's moving down.
Benry with one of those small cannon balls.
there are two sizes.
ball is enroute. Just short.
Kelly lets it go.
and it connects!
la Flor takes an early lead1-Zip.
nay, like toot! Boom!
Jill and Marty pull more, please. Pull more.
that looks super good.
I think a big one might hit that.
Alina ready with Espada's second shot.
Yes! - It connects!
just misses. We are tied 1-1.
Naonka and Dan give a nice little pull. A nice one.
let's go for that other big boy.
Marty and Jill pull.
keep pulling. Okay, stop.
it's like two feet lower than it was.
it's two feet lower than that last shot.
I think we should go up a little bit. - Okay.
all right, I think that might be perfect.
Espada ready.
Benry lets it loose.
and he connects!
purple Kelly lets it fly.
just misses, Espada leads 2-1.
you guys, I knew it. It has to be lower. - It has to be lower.
chase and Holly drop a little.
Oh, you all right?
are you making it lower?
Yeah, about six inches, eight inches. - Do it more.
go down the level with the big ball, trust me.
I think we should pull up a little bit.
Fabio, come on! Last time I listened to you.
Alina ready for Espada.
she's moved down to the second level.
drop.
going for a closer target and she connects.
let's go, Brenda! - Brenda hoping to score for La Flor.
just misses.
Espada now leads 3-1.
we need to go back to that first one we tried because we see where the first one hit.
we got little balls. - I know...
we got little balls.
are we good? Can you tell us?
it was right on it was just too short so we're going to get more momentum up here.
Benry moving down to the second level for Espada's next shot.
come on, Benry! - Come on, Ben!
Benry releases and it connects!
come on, guys! - Let's go, guys.
Brenda ready for La Flor, she releases and just miss.
Oh, my god.
Espada now leads 4-1.
there are five tiles to break.
I need Nay and Dan to pull.
pull up. Right there.
you've got to both talk about it up there.
we are. We are both talking about it up here.
feeling that, baby. - Yeah?
yeah? Let it go.
Espada could win with it with this.
just short.
la Flor still alive.
la Flor needs to score here. Trailing 4-1.
I'm going to let it go.
down on the third level with the bigger ball and it worked.
la Flor scores!
la Flor now has two, Espada at 4.
you want to go with the big one - Let's try a big one.
go grab a big one.
how does it look from there if I launch a big one from here?
does it look good?
Espada going to change balls, going with the bigger cannon ball.
lot of strategy.
the aim is perfect, guys, but we're overshooting.
when I went down there, though, it was supershort.
it's getting hard down here.
Espada could win it with this toss.
and they do! - Yeah, baby!
Espada wins immunity.
I should be a pirate!
Yes!
I really felt like we had that. - Me, too.
Espada, congratulations.
back-to-back wins, Alina. Got to feel good.
it feels absolutely amazing.
nobody going homefrom Espada. Grab your stuff, head back to camp.
enjoy the night off.
la Flor, tribal council tonight.
the eight person will be voted out of this game.
you have the afternoon to figure out who that's going to be.
grab your stuff, head back to camp. See you at tribal.
losing immunity mean we go to tribal council and the way things are shaping up it looks like the remaining La Flor members want Marty or I go and being that he has immunity idol La Flor
who do you want to go tonight?
we've got to split...
we'vegot to put three on Marty, two on Jill, make Marty play the idol, - Jill and whoever they votefor tie... - which would mean a tie.
and then we'll all vote Jill out.
okay. Jane needs her satisfaction of voting for Marty, I think.
Jane, are you going to vote for Marty?
I'm sorry, I was the ugly duckling over there.
you're a prized possession over here.
I'm a firm believer.
what goes around comes around.
Marty and Jill have treated me like I don't exist from day one, going all the way back to the Espada tribe.
I mean, I really felt like the ugly duckling over there and I know I gained the respect of Brenda, purple Kelly, Fabio and Sash.
so at tribal council I hope Marty goes home.
it's still icing on the cake if Jill goes home.
I want the cake and I want to eat it, too, and I want both of them gone.
why don't I do this?
why don't I go up to Marty and tell him it's going to be three votes for you, two votes for Jill which means you have to play your idol tonight - or I guarantee you... - you won't go home.
Jill will go home and give me the idol so that we have it and it doesn't fall into the wrong person's hands.
right now, the game plan is put three of our votes on Marty and two on Jill and tell Marty, like, bro, you gotta play the idol now.
so he does and then it will be a tie between Jill and whoever Marty and Jill vote.
and then on the revote Jill would end up going home.
what are you thinking? - I think we should really consider this.
ask Marty for the idol.
tell him you're safe, give us the idol, we'll vote out Jill and then we vote him out.
the... then the only problem I see with that is that Jill will have absolutely no allegiance or confidence in us.
it's going to happen either way.
you think she'll ever, ever, ever trust us?
we just voted out Marty!
that's what I'm saying. - Or we vote out here.
either one they don't trust us and they will not trust us.
they're not that dumb, Sash.
tonight either Marty or Jill isgoing to go home.
that's the plan.
sash and I are both stuck on what's the right thing to do and we're wondering what if we could be like super mean, ask Martyfor the idol and vote his ass out.
I never thought it would be such a tough day, dude.
so what they're saying is they'll split the vote 3-2 tonight.
three votes for you;
two votesfor Jill in hopes that the idol is flushed.
and then it would go to a tie and then in a tiebreaker Jill would go home.
Yeah.
the other option to strengthen us, you hand the idol over and I look you in the eye man to man and shake your hand that you're not going home tonight.
right. Yeah, but I...would you do that?
I'd just go home next time.
if this happens, if you give it to me, I'll look you in the eye and shake your hand again.
if we lose the next immunity challenge, I'll give you back the idol.
Jill's going home regardless.
I can't vote for her.
no, no.
I hope your people understand that. - No, no.
you... you'll vote for Jane, Brenda, whoever you want.
I think it makes sense, but, you know, it's...
you know, I can't tell you what to do with your own idol.
right now I feel absolutely powerless in every way, shape, or form.
if I keep the idol I have to use the idol tonight so...
I give Sash the idol and maybe I go home tonight maybe I don't.
I've got to give the idol to somebody so I'm either giving it to Jeff tonight or I'm giving it to Sash.
the immunity idol is yours. - Thank you, brother.
we here in this together, okay?
it's in your hands.
I'd rather give it to Sash because maybe if he lives up to his word I would maybe live one more cycle.
one more cycle could potentially get me to the merge then things are wide open.
well, it turns out I don't even have to dig for idols, all I have to do is ask for them.
people will literally hand me an idol just because I may or maynot keep them in the game a little longer.
Marty made a big mistake.
that's probably his biggest mistake in the game.
so Fabio, Back-To-Back losses, reward and immunity.
does Espada have momentum?
Yeah. I think their spirits are up.
I think they have momentum.
I think they're a strong tribe.
I think we're also strong.
I think tomorrow or the next reward challenge I think it will still be an even playing field but, yeah, they're feeling good right now.
Jane, last tribal council was crazy.
people being surprised, doublecrosses.
what was the vibe before this tribal council.
some of us got together and talked.
the ones of us that have me shed together really good and we made a decision.
is it obvious, Jane, who doesn't mesh together? Who's on the outside?
Uh-huh.
and do they know they're on the outside?
I think so. Uh-Huh.
Marty, do you feel that?
there's a sense of being in with the group and being outside of the group?
Yeah, clearly. I mean, we came in as a minority into this tribe and some of us did more of a Flip-Flop than some of us just tried to incorporate ourselves where we felt we fit in.
who Flip-Flopd? - I think Jane's a flipper.
she'll go wherever the wind blows in terms of making sure that she saves her own skin and we tried to remain strong and tried to fit in with whoever we could.
we meaning you and Jill. - Yeah.
Jane, fair criticism?
well, when we became yellow, I became yellow.
and that's the way I look at it.
Brenda, could you feel that from Jane?
totally. From day one.
she just... she's just very genuine.
she never really tried to make an alliance, it just became a natural friendship.
Jill, do you feel these paration?
Oh, definitely.
from the minute we got to camp clearly it's an old/young division that still exists.
so it's a little frustrating to be put in that situation but it's my obligation to play out of it if I can.
Marty, last tribal council there was a lot of talk about the idol, the fact that you had it, would you play it or not.
did that come up again today?
Oh, sure. And you could argue that maybe it was the stupidest move not to play it at the last tribal council or you could argue that it was the gutsiest move.
I went with my gut instincts and decided to hold on to it.
but tonight is the first time I feel like I may have made a mistake this evening.
I'm at a disadvantage now.
so do you do something, trust somebody and transfer the power of the idol and maybe if things work out and you take a risk it buys you a little more time in this game which, it's a crazy game, you never know what can happen.
Brenda, worried about where the idol is?
do you know physically where it is?
I don't know physically where it is.
I think Sash has it. - Jeff, the idol is in my pocket.
I didn't know it was in his pocket.
so Marty, what happened with the idol.
in talking to Sash we agreed that I would transfer the idol to him.
so you gave your idol to Sash.
I did. It could go down as one of the stupidest moves ever or maybe not.
Fabio, reasonable of Marty to be a little concerned that he might have just made a blonder?
I think it's very reasonable because we could easily vote him out tonight.
but either way we have the idol so I think we come out on top.
Brenda, it's interesting that to says"we have the idol."
I think it's okay to say "we"because that is how much we trust Sash.
sash, of course you think this makes perfect sense because you're the one with it in your pocket.
just out of curiosity, now that you have it in your possession for the group,
you want to give it to Brenda to hold on to?
if that's what we decide as a group then maybe back at camp I might do that.
at this moment I don't think it serves a purpose.
but if there's a time when I lose trust in them... I'm sorry.
if there's a time when they lose trust in me then I'll have to turn it over or I'll have the biggest target on my back of this entire tribe.
gotta ask, Sash, you said it, I just heard it.
if there comes a time when you lose trust in them and you have that idol in your pocket.
that's not what I meant to say but that's what I said.
Fabio, are you familiar with the psychologist Freud?
I'm a little bit familiar with Freudian psychology.
it might have been 90 of the subconscious coming up above and coming up.
Brenda, that's gonna linger in your brain for a while.
Yeah. I mean, it was a slip.
Jane, how big a mistake could it be for Marty to give up that idol to Sash before tribal council.
well, any time you watch this game you you give up the idol it comes back to haunt you.
okay, it is time to vote. Jane, you're up.
this game ain't over yet.
I'll go tally the votes.
if anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it, now would be the time to do so.
all right. Once the votes are read, the decision is final.
perm person voted out will beasked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
first vote, Jane.
Jane. Two votes Jane.
Jill. Two votes Jane, one vote Jill.
Marty. Two votes Jane; one vote Jill;one vote Marty.
Jill. That's two votes Jane; two votes Jill; one vote Marty.
Marty. We're tied.
Jane has two votes; Jill has two votes; Marty has two votes.
one vote left.
eighth person voted out of"survivor: nicaragua,"
I'll see
Jill, the tribe has spoken.
time for you to go.
well, it's clear from the vote that this group is making decisions based on loyalty.
the question is how long can that loyalty last?
grab your torches, head back to camp. Good night.
next time on"survivor."
fabio found some tree mail!
the merge brings everyone together.
if that chest is alone I'm taking stuff out of it.
so Naonka works overtime to tear everyone apart.
I was pretty frustrated when we realized all these things are missing.
it doesn't make any sense!
I'm really grateful for the opportunity to meet a lot of fantastic people.
Marty, good luck to you, my kids need someone to root for now so I hope you go all the way to the end and I just want to say how much this has made me appreciate
what a lovely little lady...
little Sandy...
watch the birdie !
Boeffie, don't touch that ! careful !
you're going to drop it !
Jesus !
where is he ?
where is he ?
l'm sick and tired of that mangy mutt !
he shat in my office again !
we can't go on like this, honey.
that mutt is on his last legs.
the kids have been playing with him for so long.
say, what's this ?
what ? - This here. These things.
trolls.
they're kobolds.
those are trolls ? well...
that's what you asked for, isn't it ?
trolls, kobolds, dryads and elves.
Yes, but not garden gnomes.
you saw the sketches, didn't you ?
Yes, but it's supposed to be for a children's musical.
Hi, Boeffie.
God, you have bad breath.
let's dance.
shit !
what did you do today, Jimmy ? - l had sex.
what ?
only joking. - Ah, a joke.
come on.
get in.
stinking mutt.
Alain, what's wrong with your toilets ?
they stink of pine. lt's as if you were shitting in a forest.
or when you're a pain in the ass.
today, you're a pain in the ass.
Ben, my favorite lawyer.
who's your good-looking friend ? - Good-looking ?
lt's Rob. - The thief.
rob, Ariane... Ariane, Rob.
author and new head of the Arts Center.
l know. Shame on me, l still haven't been there.
ls he married ? - Fortunately, yes.
well thanks. Nice compliment.
l mean...
you know...
who's this ?
rob, what's wrong ?
l just had him put to sleep.
lt's not that bad, is it ?
lt just couldn't go on like that.
that dog was crapping all over the place. lt cost me 200 euros.
200 euros ? are you kidding ?
there's always something.
the mortgage on the house for 10 more years.
Jimmy's day center costs a fortune.
and all the previous debts.
don't know how to manage anymore.
and l got a 95 euro tab here.
you too ?
ask the boss. l'm only the messenger.
what were we talking about ?
the dog. - Right, the dog.
but the cremation was included.
they incinerate dogs ?
that's not the problem. l don't know how to tell the kids.
listen, here's my advice.
lf they don't ask, don't say anything. lf they do, deny it.
no evidence, no crime.
what are you doing today, Jimmy ?
playing soccer.
ls that all ? - No, l'm also going to have sex.
what ?
lt's his new joke.
Yeah, it's a joke.
mom...
do you know where the dog is ?
l called the refuge and he's not there.
he never goes away for this long.
they have our phone number.
Hey, we're eating !
that's your dog's work. - ls Boeffie back ?
burying papers in the garden. Been looking for them for days.
do you want some ?
sandy, could you use a glass ?
ls this bottle not good ?
do you think money grows on trees ?
you could put something on.
there's nothing to see.
there is now, Rob.
go on, take a look.
Nell, could you say something please ?
OK, we know, Sandy.
why don't you go and take a shower ?
cartoons ! cartoons !
Jimmy, can't you ask that normally ?
what do you mean, " normally " ?
what's wrong with you today ?
nothing.
Hi, Monique. - Hi, Rob.
could you help me ? - Sure.
the one in the back ?
Yes.
lt's far back, isn't it ?
there you are.
here. - Thanks.
Mrs. Haesenbroeck. Hello.
Mr. De Koster.
ls that the latest fashion ?
a bit shorter and she'd be walking around in her underwear.
lf she's wearing any.
a drink, Mrs. Haesenbroeck ? - You know l don't drink.
and l find it out of place that you drink at work.
l hope you bought that bottle with your money.
Mrs. Haesenbroeck, it's an aperitif for the suppliers.
to reduce costs.
you know how things work. - No, l don't.
but l know that l hold receipts for expenses worth a fortune.
especially on drinks. Here...
champagne dinner for ten...
two kegs of beer in one evening... And here...
...5, 000 euros for an Electro Lapauw TH 32...
...PA 30, including...
ls that the time ?
l have to go to the rehearsal.
will you please answer me first ?
well...
lt's for a TV set.
l bought a flat screen TV for the Center.
but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Mr. De Koster, you should understand that you are a temporary manager and that l vote for your nomination.
Yes, l know and l'm pleased.
but l really have to go. Please, don't get up.
Monique, put a valium in that woman's coffee.
l heard you.
Yes, honey, it's me.
sorry about what happened earlier.
l might have been a little curt, but...
yesterday, l went to the vet's...
and Boeffie won't be coming home.
sit down, hurry up.
you have all received a brochure that contains information on rape, incest and pedophilia.
Mrs. Lydia De Beule wrote it.
she is here to give a few lessons on these topics we wonder about, but for which we don't always get answers.
like chemistry, physics and math ?
OK, Kevin, we got it, that's enough.
Mrs. De Beule...
so... Has anyone ever heard of the concept of " sexual intimidation " ?
you must have read articles, heard about it, seen TV shows about it.
that will be today's topic, and l hope to give you some advice on how to protect yourselves from it.
lt doesn't just concern girls, it also affects boys.
it can happen to anyone.
...you're home early.
good, l can leave earlier then.
l'll probably be home late. Will you take care of Jimmy ?
Boeffie still isn't back.
why do the things l like always disappear ?
same thing with Dad.
and Boeffie was his dog.
you don't even remember your dad.
and he's not here anymore... But Rob is.
rob, the big shot.
lt's true, he's always acting like he's the boss.
l'm fed up with that.
rob can also be kind.
and we weren't doing that good before l married him. You might have forgotten.
mom, do you love Rob ?
what a question ! of course l do.
you're too young to understand.
l'm 16, l'm not a kid anymore.
no...
...you're not 16.
you just turned 1 5.
1 5 and a half.
almost 1 5 and a half.
lt's always the same thing.
that authoritarian has a follower.
you always have to be right, stupid cunt.
start with a kick, and a left, then a right hook.
all right ? go ahead, Christel.
and... two, three !
come on. lt's for TV.
think about perception.
come on, faster. Keep going.
are we the weaker sex ? absolutely not.
we won't let anyone take advantage of us.
come on, give it all. - And... cut.
Yes, OK.
was it all right ? - Yes, everything.
l still have a few exercises. - l've had enough, thanks.
OK, girls, we're done.
thank you, ladies.
l'd say... continue like this.
l mean... Really, l think it's very brave that you... l mean...
the voices of those interviewed will be distorted.
you will not be recognizable.
and, of course, this address will not be disclosed.
thanks a lot.
Maurice, is it OK ? are we done ?
Yes, it was fine.
say, Rob... - Yes, Monique ?
are you ready ?
let's go and have a drink in the new lounge bar.
Yes.
Hello, Sandy speaking.
am I through to the De Kosters ?
Yes.
could I speak to Rob De Koster ?
he's not here. Can l take a message ?
it's about his dog...
cremation ?
what are you saying ?
what cremation ?
l felt dizzy.
everything's all right now.
Rob... l told you...
...to move your feet...
...but nothing else, right ?
you horny devil.
...l'd rather go home.
l promised my wife l'd be home early.
your wife ? she isn't here.
aren't we just fine together ?
and we still have work to talk about.
so what's the problem ?
can't we do this some other time ?
are you trying to lure me somewhere ?
come, let's go back and sit down.
two coffees, please.
come on, Rob, that's no fun.
two coffees, please.
Monique, l have to tell you something.
jobs are appointed by the board of directors.
l have enough trouble with them.
l'm not appointed either. l can't help you.
what are we doing here, then ?
you felt like going out.
l thought you could arrange things for me.
so what ? should l forget about this contract ?
are you turning me on to get a job ?
l'm turning you on ?!
who do you think l am ?
a slut who fucks the boss ?
who was rubbing himself against me, with a boner in his pants ?
calm down. The coffees are coming.
drink it yourself.
Monique, please stay seated.
no. How much is it ? l'm going home.
nothing. l'll pay for it.
no, you're right. l'm drunk.
l'm going home.
two coffees.
here you are.
seen that ?
...what are you doing here in the middle of the night ?
why were you in Sandy's bedroom ? - Quiet, she's sleeping.
her light was on, as usual. Do you need to pee ?
coming.
mom !
mom ! - lt's all right, darling.
get out of my bedroom !
get out ! l'm telling you to get out !
you had a nightmare, that's all.
no, get out !
Jimmy, come here.
get back to bed.
everyone in this family is nuts.
what happened ? what did you dream about ?
l don't want to talk about it.
come on, Jimmy, back to bed. - l want him to stay.
all right.
what's wrong with this quilt ?
lt's all rolled up into a ball.
are you comfortable ?
come on darling... my angel...
...my little baby.
sleep well.
sweet dreams, darling.
does she eat normally ?
what does " normally " mean ?
three balanced meals a day.
fruits, vegetables, cereals.
Yes, she does. - That's a good thing.
at her age, it's usually French fries, chips, sodas and hamburgers.
but nothing for the past week.
she doesn't feel like anything.
she spends her time in bed, reading brochures.
she won't go to school anymore.
she refuses to talk to me or my husband.
do you have chocolate ?
yes... l might have some.
she's 1 5, right ?
1 5 and a half.
almost.
could she be heartbroken ?
there's some chocolate on top. - Thanks.
l got her blood test results yesterday. Everything is fine.
even the amphetamine and drugs test was negative.
l would have noticed.
l often hear that. Parents believe that.
no, l spent a year in detox for speed addiction, so l would have noticed.
l didn't know.
as l was saying, there's no problem with Sandy.
there's nothing to worry about.
she's going through puberty, that's all.
l would just advise you not to give in to her whims.
starting from today, back to school, whether she wants it or not.
no treatment at all ?
l'll prescribe some vitamins, it can't harm her.
stupid.
that's enough, now.
you can go fool around in the corridor.
lt's important to be direct.
undesired intimacy can be avoided if one expresses clearly that it is not wanted.
does anyone have anything to say ?
anything you've experienced ?
that's all for today.
read the brochure carefully.
are you Sandy ?
Yes.
apparently, you've been away almost a week.
are you better ?
l didn't feel well. We quarreled at home.
no. - l know...
...It's very bad for one's health, but, sometimes, l need a cigarette.
tell me about yourself.
do you have brothers and sisters ?
l have a brother, Jimmy.
ln the daytime, he goes to this special center.
he's mentally retarded, but he does OK.
l go to a special center too. - Oh yes...
for women.
right... And your parents ?
are they still together ?
five years ago, my mother remarried someone.
"someone " ?
l read your brochure while l was sick.
the story of that girl...
with her stepfather ?
you want to talk about your stepfather ?
my mother is always on his side.
and now that Boeffie is dead, they can't blame him anymore.
l bought some panties...
...and now, they've disappeared.
l think it's Rob...
...who pinched them from the bathroom.
the dog has nothing to do with it.
are you sure ?
l feel like he's spying on me all the time.
at night, he comes into my bedroom.
so l pretend to be asleep.
...has your stepfather ever touched you ?
we need more trees. We're busy making them.
lt'll bring more depth. We'll also move the set back.
what a cute young thing...
Bye. - See you tomorrow.
Mr. De Koster ?
don't you recognize me ?
Saartje. Saartje Verhoeff.
l used to come and play with Sandy, in primary school.
Saartje... Ah, Saartje...
Yes, Saartje Verhoeff, of course.
wow... you have grown.
how old are you now ?
13. - 13 ?
you're a big girl and all.
say hi to Sandy for me. Ask her to call me.
Bye, Eric. - Bye.
a few hot summers and she can come and knock at my door.
say...
...the trolls... Actually...
...they look like garden gnomes. But don't tell her.
lt's kind of my fault.
am l interrupting anything ? - ls it raining that bad ?
Yes, real bad.
l thought we were supposed to meet tonight.
Yes, but l was bored.
and my trolls are done.
Eric, could you give me your opinion ?
l have one in my car.
l have to go, l have work.
good luck. - Thanks.
rob says they look like garden gnomes, but that's ridiculous, they really are so scary.
Jimmy, what are you doing outside ?
why aren't you inside ?
why didn't you go in ?
nobody's answering.
let's get inside before you get pneumonia.
and it'll be my fault, as usual.
get in.
come on, take your shirt off.
your trousers, take them off.
Jimmy, you're not wearing any shorts !
Hello, we're home !
come on, get up.
put your trousers back on.
what are you doing here ? what is all this ?
where were you ?
and these clothes ? they're all wet.
no wonder.
Jimmy was sitting outside, in the rain.
once again, you weren't home.
how come ? Jimmy comes home two hours after you.
lt's my fault again, right ?
l knew it.
l'm only good enough to baby-sit.
do you remember Brussels ?
you were so high that you forgot about Jimmy and me.
you went coke-whoring with some horny creep.
go to your bedroom !
cool it !
look, big dick !
Congratulations.
Hi, Nell.
can l come in ?
sure.
what a surprise.
how long has it been ?
lt's been ages.
Jimmy is... 1 7 now.
he goes to a good school center nearby.
and Sandy... she's 1 5.
and you, how have you been doing ?
are you still in charge of that... ? - Oh, no.
l manage the battered women's refuge.
and give self-affirmation courses in high school.
that's where Sandy goes to school.
l know. That's what l've come to talk about.
what ? you've seen Sandy ?
Yes. But l don't think she remembers me.
you used to come without your children, remember ?
nice house.
so Rob finally got hooked and settled down ?
our thing, it only lasted a few months.
"our thing " ?
rob never told you we had an affair ?
anyway, that's not important. - Ah, yes, that...
do you know what's going on with Sandy ?
what do you mean ?
there's a problem ?
did you come to check up on us ? - Of course not.
l don't work in child protection any longer.
and you don't need assistance any more either.
Lydia, thanks for stopping by...
Nell, l'm serious.
people like you are rare.
sandy has become a beautiful young lady.
she always was adorable.
does she get along with Rob ?
how's their relationship ?
what are you suggesting ?
OK, let's get to the point.
l think that Sandy and Rob...
sandy told me things...
let me finish, l think...
...Sandy is being abused.
what ?! By who ?
calm down, l'm not accusing you.
sandy tried to tell me about what was going on here.
she says Rob harasses her sexually.
who ?!
sandy said that ?
what are you saying ?
sandy never said that ! you're a liar !
you're jealous !
get out of here ! get out !
Nell, her underwear disappears.
at night, she sees Rob in her bedroom, she's been video taped.
you can't ignore this. You have a huge responsibility.
very often, the spouse is not receptive to the signs.
unconsciously.
what signs ?
what's that scar on her wrist ?
what scar ?
you see ?
you don't know what's wrong with Sandy.
get out of here !
l'm on your side. - Out ! get out !
get out of here !
lf you're not involved in it, l'm on your side.
take your bag and get out !
now ! right away !
l never took your kids away from you. l'm warning you !
go away !
Lydia, what are you doing here ? what's going on ?
she's threatening me.
we had an agreement. Now fuck off.
that's it, fuck off !
she wants to take my kids away ! - l never said that !
yes you did ! rob, she says she wants to take my kids away from me.
she wants my kids ! she wants my kids !
calm down.
calm down. You're shaking.
what's wrong ?
ls she the Lydia you had an affair with ?
ls she the Lydia you told me about ?
was she the one harassing you, the one with the ass like an elephant ?
she doesn't have a big ass.
her ass is very ordinary. lt's not big.
she doesn't have a big ass ! - Nell, what's wrong with you ?
you have my phone number, right ?
you can call me day and night, all right ?
keep your cell phone with you. - OK.
get inside.
hurry up. And you...
l don't want to see you again or l'll call the cops.
l think Rob would rather not have the police involved. Right, Bob ?
have you both gone crazy ? - No, it's you !
what's this bitch doing here ? what are you two up to ?
you know who she is ? miss De Beule, from school.
sandy, she's our former social worker.
what did you go and tell her ?
nothing. What are you doing ?
Where's the scar ? - A scar ? lt's just a scratch.
are you mad, or what ?
sandy, you know you can tell me everything.
l might not feel like telling everything.
for once, someone is listening to me.
Nell, Lydia was nothing. lt was only...
sexual ?
lt wasn't important, Nell.
l never asked you about your past.
l saw her five or six times in three months.
what ? three months ?
lt's three months now ?
you know, while you were fucking her, l was groveling before her to feed my kids.
l didn't know that.
you always fly off the handle.
that woman is insane, and she's a dyke.
Oh, she's a lesbian now.
how would you know ? did you have a threesome with some other slut ?
Oh, please...
and l don't want to see you in Sandy's bedroom at night.
then she should switch the light off.
rob, she's 15, she needs privacy.
my Dad used to do the same thing.
he'd come in to my bedroom at night.
to check if l was breathing.
for what ? you haven't seen him for over ten years.
what's that got to do with it ?
do you want us to talk about your family ?
when you get up there, send me a postcard.
sir, l have 13 years of experience in this field.
Yes, but do you have any evidence ?
say something.
lately, Sandy has often been away from school but...
and her mother, who totally denies everything.
her aggressiveness. That's typical.
she literally threw me out.
and l bet she didn't say a word to her husband.
and there are some signs of self-mutilation on Sandy.
did you see her right wrist ?
lt's a bit delicate to accuse someone just like that.
my priority is the child's protection.
you wouldn't want to feel guilty about De Koster's disgusting filth.
no, but l am opposed to alerting the police at this point.
we must confront Mr. De Koster with the accusations.
so he'll cover up and conceal all the evidence.
but do as you wish.
l have an obligation to tell the police.
lf l don't, l'd be failing to render assistance and that's against the law.
Mr. De Koster is here. Should l show him in ?
what are you doing here ?
ls there a problem with Sandy ? - You hypocritical bastard.
Mr. De Koster...
Mrs. De Beule has informed us of something.
your stepdaughter told Mrs. De Beule that you are harassing her sexually.
what ?!
who ? sandy ?
he's pretending not to know.
she told me everything.
the saucy videos on the nude beach, the nightly visits in her bedroom.
for how long ?
this whole story really bothers me, Mr. De Koster.
do you have anything to say ?
Mr. Broeckmans...
...a few years ago, l had an affair with this woman.
then, she harassed me for months. - What ?!
l harassed him ? that's ridiculous.
ridiculous !
l didn't even know Sandy was his stepdaughter. l hadn't recognized her.
and that's why you threatened to take my wife's children away ?
like you used to ? - l told you. He denies it all.
so does his wife. She takes his side.
l won't accept that. Sorry, lvan.
l won't be insulted by someone who is clearly...
sorry, l can't accept that.
Mrs. De Beule, what's going on ?
what relations did you have with Mr. De Koster ?
you want evidence ? - Yes !
you'll get evidence.
lt all started when we went on holiday to Spain.
we were on a nude beach.
how old were you at that time ?
12 or 13 years old.
12 or 13 ?
12 and a half.
13
and you were there alone with your stepfather ?
at first,Mom was there too, with Jimmy.
but they drove home.
rob and l were swimming.
then, l got my stuff and l dried off.
then, l lay face down on the towel.
and then...
...Rob began filming me.
what was he filming ?
your genitals ?
l don't know. l was face down.
didn't you think it was strange that he filmed you ?
rob often carries his camera with him.
did he ever film you again when you were naked ?
could you keep it down ? we're busy !
sorry.
shall we take a break and move somewhere else ?
Yes, stop.
you can tell me everything.
what your stepfather does is not your fault.
do you remember our conversation about that girl ?
you won't remember everything immediately, but l'm here to help you remember. All right ?
little Sandy...
watch the birdie...
what are you doing home ?
what are you doing with those tapes ?
Oh, what a lovely little lady.
l was at the school.
your hysterical daughter accuses me of...
of what, Rob ?
but...
what was her underwear doing in your bathrobe pocket ?
you too ?
and you filmed the child naked ?
no... Stop...
you bastard !
you really are an asshole !
go away ! get out of here !
l don't want to see you again !
rob, it's about time that l got rid of that box.
no... I'm hiding...
do you have the screwdrivers ?
what are you doing ?
have you gone mad, or what ?
that's mine.
lt's my TV set.
no, it's not ours. lt's the Arts Center's.
you really thought l had 5, 000 euros in my drawer ?
hello.
I was washing my hair.
I was in the bath tub.
and I heard someone come in.
it was Rob...
...with his video camera.
what did you do ?
nothing.
I let him film me. - Just like that ?
Yes.
until now, l haven't heard or seen any evidence of sexual abuse.
and Sandy seems vague and lacks self-assurance.
Yes, this child has been intimidated.
but you've listened to her ?
he comes and films her in her bath, he enters her room at night.
who knows what else she doesn't dare say ?
what Sandy says is not enough.
there are presumptions of his suspicious behavior, but that is not enough to arrest him.
what ? this child is in permanent danger.
even if there is no physical evidence.
the gynecological tests don't confirm your accusations.
she is still a virgin.
he's not stupid.
there are other sexual acts.
anal sex, for example.
forced fellatio.
the only thing we can do, is summon that man for an interview.
what about a search ?
a search warrant ?
they're not that easy to obtain.
l know someone who works for TV news.
l hope you're not threatening me.
listen, we won't get a search warrant.
but there might be another possibility.
wouldn't you rather stay home ? - No, it's OK.
be home on time.
or Jimmy will be stuck outside again.
Hey, Sandy, what happened ?
l certainly wouldn't tell you, you dwarf.
dwarf, right... l'm but a year older than you.
sandy prefers older men.
Mrs. Haas ? Lydia De Beule from the battered women refuge.
Yes, you came with a crew recently.
Conny... May l call you Conny ?
l have something that might interest you for the news.
a topical subject. And very spectacular.
I believe that, being an administrator, you cannot keep someone as a manager if he has committed actions that are, let's say...
...suspicious. - l do hope your interest will be as great when it gets to our subsidies.
l am here as a member of the parents' association of the school, not as a politician.
let's get to today's agenda.
what are the new accusations against Mr. De Koster ?
ls it only a rumor that he has had inappropriate attitudes...
...regarding his stepdaughter ?
lt's not a rumor, Jan, a complaint has been filed.
what beats all, is that it's not only his stepdaughter.
Saartje Verhoeff, who takes ballet courses and dances in the show, has also been bothered. You were even there.
he told her she had grown.
while looking at her bust.
he was ogling her.
complimenting a 13-year-old girl about her breasts, l call that sexual intimidation.
what happened, exactly ?
nothing. He found her cute.
a 13-year-old child !
he said she could come and knock at his door in a few years.
but it was a joke.
ln a few years, when she's 1 5.
and that's not all.
there have been complaints about Mr. De Koster entering the girls' rest rooms while they are changing.
Yes, several worried parents called me about that.
he goes in the girls' rest rooms ?
lt may have happened.
there should be a real changing room.
that's not the point.
he made a pass at me too.
he wanted to talk about my contract and we went for a drink in some sleazy bar.
and he started touching me up.
l had to run away.
he wanted a payment in kind.
Monique, why didn't you tell before ?
l don't know...
l like my job here and l don't want to lose it.
and he was quite intoxicated.
no wonder.
this guy is a real lush boozer.
lf you knew the budget he pours down his throat.
and when l call him to order, he pretends not to hear.
why wasn't l informed of this ?
why have we tolerated Mr. De Koster's behavior for so long ?
l'd like to know.
as a legal adviser, l must inform you that a person is innocent until proven guilty.
are you suggesting that we are liars ?
no, Mrs. Haesenbroeck.
but before taking any radical measure, l think we should... - Yes, but...
de Koster can still be fired for severe misconduct, right ?
he can be temporarily suspended until we find enough evidence to sack him.
l propose we vote to suspend him.
those in favor, raise your hands.
only members of the Board, Monique.
sign here, please.
OK, that's done.
you've invited us in and you don't object to our taking some personal items for further investigation.
that's how eighty percent of all searches happen, with the owner's consent.
will we get everything back ? - Sure.
what have you done to his computer ? rob doesn't even want me to dust it.
we've just copied the hard disk. Your husband won't notice a thing.
meanwhile, we can check at our ease whether he's interested in child porn or something along those lines.
come on, people... There's nothing here for you to see. Go home.
captain... Just one question, please.
Benny, l'd like a word with you.
l can't help for professional advice.
come on, l just want to talk.
rob, you've been suspended from the Arts Center.
suspended ? but why ?
what ? for that stupid thing ?
we brought that TV back together.
your daughter, the girls from the ballet...
you're lucky to be free, you know ?
you think that Sandy and l... - l think...
l'm busy talking. Do you mind ? Thanks.
we've known each other for 30 years. - Here's my advice:
start a therapy, get a treatment, you're sick.
Ben, we've been friends for 30 years.
do you really think l would do that ?
talking to you could ruin my career and my life. Leave me alone.
you're pathetic. - No, you're pathetic.
your career and your life are ruined, not mine ! think about it.
l don't know you anymore. Go away.
asshole.
l'd cool it if l were you. We all know you're a pervert.
now it's you. Are you gonna hit me with your towel ?
with that foot of yours, you won't go far, you sorry excuse for a director.
jerk.
l'd appreciate it if you paid your tab.
lf l see you here again, your head goes in the toilets.
you know, the pine forest with shit. You thought l'd forgotten ?
fuck you ! faggot !
get out of here, asshole !
your tab !
this is my home, and l want the truth !
what about ?
tell your Mom the truth.
tell her the truth, you little cunt !
let go of her ! don't touch her !
that's enough ! stop it !
stop !
stop it !
that's enough !
stop ! stop !
no !
get out !
take your fancy coat !
fuck you ! you're out !
lt's over.
lt's over.
Mrs. De Koster ? - Yes.
paul Smeets fromHet Laatste Nieuws.
ls Mr. De Koster in ?
no. Why ?
l would have liked him to react to this article.
what is this ?
how dare they publish such crap ?
there's even our address.
lt's not our newspaper.
we're not responsible for our fellow reporters.
l would like a reaction to it.
what do you make of respect for our private life ?
you're the one who went to the cops.
Yes, and l already regret it.
you regret it ?
can you tell us more about that ?
no, l don't really feel like it.
take that newspaper away.
get out ! come on, out !
what's going on ? what are they doing here ?
journalists.
Maurice, we're too late.
say, isn't that the pedophile in the dirty Volvo ?
very funny... - Where ?
lt's De Koster. - You're right !
come on, Maurice, film !
God damn it, there he is !
behind me, you see Rob De Koster driving away after having seen our crew and our colleagues from the press.
an unusual reaction for an innocent man, in my opinion...
...in our opinion... Oh shit !
lNCEST lN THE SUBURBS
Mrs. De Koster. l didn't recognize you...
...with your glasses on.
are you buying that newspaper ?
nice picture.
they say she helped her husband commit those pervert acts.
that doesn't surprise me.
when people can't take care of themselves, how can they raise children ?
it beats me.
really, I find it outrageous.
could all this have been avoided ?
were there signs that could have unmasked this couple ?
the educational psychologist, Lydia De Beule, believes so.
educational psychologist ?
she's just a social worker.
typically, the criminal, often the father or stepfather, is not the only guilty person.
silent mothers are frequent accomplices in incest cases.
it's called guilty knowledge.
here, the eccentric past of the mother must be taken into account, with all the abuse typical to the environment of drug consumption, promiscuity...
promiscuity ? who's the whore here ?
good day. ls your husband there ?
no.
do you know where l can find him ?
no, why ?
we have a warrant for his arrest.
and it has been decided that your daughter should temporarily go to the center.
with that De Beule slut ?
just as a precaution.
your husband could get aggressive.
so she has managed to take my children away from me after all.
can you call me if he stops by ?
wait, her clothes.
and what have you done ? - Nothing.
I let him film me.
what ? - Yes.
rituals, porn videos and anal intercourse.
how could it have gone unnoticed ?
that was her last testimony. On Monday evening.
lt was recorded between 8: 12 and 9: 02 p. m.
what about the other video tape ?
any news, lnspector ?
what's in the computer file report ?
l examined the data in the report, and noticed...
what are you doing ? I'm having a bath.
turn that camera off.
turn it off, I tell you.
stop filming.
why hasn't this scumbag been arrested yet ?
call his wife back. l have more to show her.
Yes, he's here.
we were informed that Rob De Koster will soon be here.
he was arrested half an hour ago.
he showed no resistance.
Mr. De Koster, you are being lead before the judge. Your feelings ?
bastard ! scum !
l am innocent, madam.
l gave myself up voluntarily.
you dirty scum !
this your first time ?
Yes.
de Koster, is that it ?
a child molester.
l saw you on TV, man.
you're going to have a rough time here.
you can't imagine.
a pedophile... - l am innocent.
sure... We're all here for no reason.
start shitting your pants, because they don't like child rapists in jail.
you should be lucky if only your ass gets reamed out.
but a fucking pervert like you, they'll slice your nuts off.
Hey, smart ass !
are you done yet, speedfreak ?
anything else but white powder between those cauliflower ears ?
what's wrong with my ears ?
fuck !
you, come on here.
the investigating magistrate is waiting.
ls this necessary ?
come on.
...Maria... born October 21st, 1957.
l have just received your lnternet history data.
even on just the basis of that, l can charge you on the spot.
there's a law against possessing child pornography.
we found some pretty obscene stuff on your hard disk.
you forgot to erase your history file ? not smart.
l have never been on a porn site...
they all say that.
but you could... - That's right, l could do anything.
but l have no obligation to do so.
listen.
my daughter is the same age...
...and l take very seriously the criminal activities a swine like you spends time on.
sir, l have done nothing.
really ? the charges are unequivocal.
every day, we get new elements that lead us to believe this is not your first attempt.
l know my rights. l want a lawyer.
you don't know them that well.
your only right is to plead guilty quickly.
later on, your lawyer can say that you are sick, that you will undergo a therapy and all that crap.
l am totally innocent.
so you uphold your previous statement.
you don't know about a thing.
here is a statement to that effect.
you can sign it, but it's not compulsory.
l'll sign with no hesitation. l'm innocent.
Mr. De Koster...
...you astound me.
you have studied but you lack intelligence.
but... it's double-sided !
with questions you never asked and answers l never gave.
like, " Do you want a lawyer appointed ? "
the answer is " no " , but l just asked for one.
that's a false statement !
are you threatening me ?
that's what l'm going to do. - Take this bastard away.
you are a dangerous psychopath.
you're the psychopath ! forger !
l'll have you institutionalized !
you psychopath !
...intimidating young people.
earlier today, De Koster gave himself up to the police.
he was handcuffed and taken to the investigating magistrate.
the list of charges against him is growing every day...
the public prosecutor's spokesman made no statement on other possible charges against De Koster.
but a closed session decided to charge this presumed pedophile, much to the joy of a group of demonstrators who were waiting on the Courthouse steps for this reassuring news.
with me, Mrs. Ariane De Bock, president of the parents' committee of the school attended by De Koster's stepdaughter.
Mrs. De Bock, due to the numerous reactions of parents worried about De Koster's suspicious behavior, you informed authorities...
what are you doing ? I'm having a bath.
turn the camera off.
I said turn it off.
stop filming.
give it to me. It's my turn to film you.
you'll tell me what you think of it.
wow, sexy little ass.
hello.
Hi. - Are you not getting up ?
are you OK ?
Yes.
the first days are the toughest.
they tell me you behave well.
so we won't make things more complicated for you.
of course, if you act stubborn, like those across the hall, you might end up in a cell with 3 other detainees.
who will you be with ?
moroccans, specialized in knives,
Albanian mobsters, a nigger with a cock this big.
lt's up to you.
OK, let's turn the lights off.
l'll stop by during my rounds and peep through the window.
no desperate stuff, OK ? - No.
sleep tight.
l want my daughter ! now !
Where's Sandy ?!
sandy, come with me !
l want to go with my Mom !
you low-life scum ! you filthy junkie !
let me go !
scum !
what the hell was all that about ?
that woman is mad !
sandy, my sweetheart...
l want you to tell me the truth.
all those stories about Rob, what do they mean ?
what happened ?
talk to me, Sandy !
talk to me... You never listen.
you only listen to Rob.
everyone has to listen to Rob.
prison will do him good.
l'm not talking about that.
ls it true or not ?
you think l'm lying ? then take me back to Lydia's.
mad or not, she stands up for me and understands me.
come on !
lf you don't talk to me, l can't help you.
leave me alone !
leave me alone ! - All right. Calm down.
calm down.
OK, let's go home.
fasten your seatbelt.
pull yourself together. We're going home.
yes ?
l'll take that into account in my inquiry, but your daughter's statement holds other accusations.
my daughter...
...has been influenced.
after all, she's just a 15-year-old girl, and you know that... - Madam, are you suggesting that l'm not doing this thoroughly or that we manipulate people ? - l didn't say that.
madam, magistrates are often blamed for not taking statements like this one seriously, so will you please stop accusing me.
at least take a look at the original tape.
lt all started from there. - Yes, but it didn't stop there.
we have numerous statements that point to your husband's guilt.
please.
OK.
l'll take it into account but...
...as long as your daughter's statement stands, l must go on.
on top of that, it's raining !
Jimmy, what's this ?
ls it your favorite ?
do you... ?
do you want me to put it on ?
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
these are pictures of your father.
why did you do that ?
l want to know...
...why you did that.
rob had Boeffie put to sleep.
what ?!
all this...
...for an old sick dog that we put to sleep ?
what ? you knew ?
but Sandy, it was just a dying dog...
...the vet put to sleep.
why didn't you say anything ?
rob never touched you, did he ?
how could you say that ?
how could l believe you ?
how could we all believe you ?
my dreams are so realistic.
and Rob...
...he looks at me in a funny way.
he gives me the creeps.
and Lydia...
...she says l've forgotten some things.
no, that l have repressed them.
that something has happened.
come here...
come here...
your father...
you were 4 years old and your father was practicing a performance on the roof.
maybe l should have shown you earlier.
are we ready ? - OK.
OK let's go.
everybody's ready !
sandy, be careful ! sandy !
wallet, cell phone...
...key ring with six keys, and a ring.
would you please sign here.
ls there a crowd outside ?
a crowd ?
Yes, newspapers, television ?
they have long forgotten about you.
you're like yesterday's news.
tell them to block the ninjas.
Yes, sir.
block the ninjas.
stop!
faster!
what? The road's been open.
Ninjas' illusion. Rush ahead!
Mr. Brian the "Crimson Box" won't open.
who killed Dr. Kikuchi?
Lord, it's me.
you know how to open the box?
I'm sorry, Lord. I don't.
So...why did you kill him?
go ask him how to open it.
I tell you to ask Dr. Kikuchi!
excuse me, Dr. Kikuchi how to open the Crimson Box?
you fully misunderstood me.
I told you to ask him in hell!
stupid ass.
he's dead, but some brain cells are still alive.
I'm trying to collect from his brain the data stored just before his death.
we might find out something.
why does the computer keep repeating the instruction "COPY KILL"
I'm not sure, but they're...what Dr. Kikuchi thought before death.
copy is not an instruction It's a person's name.
kill"copy"
Kikuchi didn't let us open the box, and wanted a person called "COPY" to die.
I'm sure "COPY" is the key to the Crimson Box.
tora, the "Jinrui" inside is crucial to me.
capture Copy alive to open the box for me.
Yes, Lord.
Grandpa...Look, I've picked all the best herbs.
all people in Kirikakure Village must buy our medicines.
you'll never pick all herbs in such a big hill.
you're right.
Hey, have you found any?
no.
it's okay. I have.
I'll come with you tomorrow.
fine. Let's get back. Sure.
is it too heavy?
it's okay.
I must shoot you next time.
you wanna shoot Mimi?
of course.
after 20 years of practice.
Mimi, you've made grandpa angry!
your Lord Dr Kikuchi commands his men...to kill the "Key Master" Copy.
let me do it for you.
do you wanna kill?
killing is not the only way.
understand?
Yes, grandpa.
Kikuchi hadn't commanded murders for 10 years.
xiao Ling, there's a thing affecting the world's peace.
it's now on the hands of an international adventurist.
lucky that before they find the "Key Master" Copy, the thing's still useless.
find Copy and take him to the Kirikakure Village.
don't let the enemy approach him.
I'm preparing.
Mimi, find the Crimson Box.
Mimi!
nobody understands my music.
you eat it? Chokes you to death.
only this left.
it's expired. Want it?
I don't think you dickhead will mind it.
don't spit it. Swallow them all.
come on.
pay the debt or all your family will die.
loan plus interest. $155, 568.
my family? Only me...
no.
and you, Black.
black...
why don't you move die of the expired sausage?
black...
the time we got most money...was when someone gave us $1,000.
but...what you ate was bought using this $1,000.
black, well done.
a pet should not starve.
it's me who play music, not you.
I'm coming soon, Black.
no one likes my music What do I live for?
do I want to die?
Yes, I do.
you can't!
miss, who're you looking for?
are you Copy?
you know me?
what can I do for you?
forget it for now.
just remember, you can't die.
your friend?
miss, who are you looking for?
I'm looking for Copy.
Yes, I am.
did Spray tell you to find me?
I owe that much?
what can I get you?
gin Straight! Double, double!
Thanks.
great...
one more, please.
why don't you drink this?
I don't know you.
I never drink.
I bought this just for you.
thank you very much!
thank you!
why in such a rush?
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.
you don't want to tell me you're being hunted?
how do you know?
I just guess.
chased, not hunted. I'm still alive.
little Copy!
so happy drinking here.
just a little, dear Spray.
little Copy I've been trying so hard...to send e-mails to you but you never replied.
you don't even wanna pay. It's obvious.
I do want to pay, but...I have no money yet.
it's no different from refusing.
there's some difference.
hit me?
he owes me...155568
$1 for each punch. Get him!
I think you'd better give up.
I thought so too.
you thought?
thank you.
follow me.
how come I'm so popular today?
Where're you taking me to?
I...I can't run any more.
hold on. Cross the hilltop and we'll get there.
cross the hilltop?
you better kill me here!
go!
I'm dying...I'm dying of thirst, I need a drink
it's too dangerous! One sip...
one sip only. Quick...
my Lord commanded me to kill him, not you.
get away!
I'm here to protect him You piss off!
which means I must kill you.
tonight this "red girl" wants to kill me...and this "green girl" wants to save me.
now the green girl's saving the red girl.
she can kill me again once she's healed up.
can you tell me what's been going on?
I'll ask again. Can you tell me what's been going on?
I mean, why am I so popular tonight?
maybe I'm giving you trouble...
if you keep silent, I'll go.
I'm really going.
honestly, I'm not afraid of death.
I just want to know why.
it's all about Dr. Kikuchi.
which Dr. Kikuchi?
he's my Lord. Ireceived his order to kill you.
what did I do to offend your Lord?
I don't wanna know.
I just know the order of my Lord is without question.
is your Lord a psycho?
Dr. Kikuchi is an upper class ninja of "Iga Clan."
10 years ago before I lived here...I was a middle class ninja Dr. Kikuchi was my Lord.
we both taught and learned and we were friends.
a month ago, he devised a thing that can help...making powerful poisons and cures - "Jinrui."
he put "Jinrui" into a box and...delivered it to the Worldwide Plague Prevention Center.
but on his way he was attacked.
Finally...Dr. Kikuchi was beheaded.
and the box was stolen.
the one who assaulted him...was with "Koga Clan" led by Tora Daisuke.
Tora's working for a villain, Brian.
sorry, but... what does it have to do with me?
because he just got the box...but the box is made of refined "Red Steel."
no one can open it except Dr. Kikuchi and you.
I can open the box?
I've never seen it.
no box, no key. How do I open it?
you can do it.
or else Dr. Kikuchi wouldn't want you to die.
at least I should know why he wanted me to die!
he didn't want the villain to get "Jinrui."
the man who seized me...
he's a ninja for Koga Clan.
you have to know that life is precious.
Dr. Kikuchi had been developing "Jinrui..."just for saving people.
be a good person I hope you'll understand.
okay, I'll let him go now.
but if Koga Clan's ninjas come to seize him, I must kill him.
thank you.
so what am I gonna do?
stay here. Grandpa and I will protect you.
you stand for thousands of lives.
before we've found the Crimson Box...You shall not leave Kirikakure Village.
Ladies...and gentlemen. I've thought for a whole night.
I realized there's no TV and no movies here. No Internet, no video games. I'm kind of bored to death.
and I...really don't know how to open the box.
I'm useless to the bandits.
so...I think it's better for me to return to the city.
I'll kill you if you dare leave here.
you say you wanna kill me.
why don't you question taking revenge for your boss?
ninjas must obey their Lord's orders.
I'll have my revenge once I've killed you.
we didn't know you can't open the box...and neither do the bandits.
but, if you're caught and say you can't, do you think they'll believe you?
I trust you.
but never the Koga Clan.
I'll never trust you whatever you say.
okay, I won't go then.
but can I buy some wine?
we have some.
taste it. I made it myself.
master Basho. There shouldn't be any scent on ninjas.
that means they don't drink.
you're not a ninja at all!
I've decided not to be a ninja 10 years ago.
excuse me, Master Basho.
your wine tastes the same as insecticide.
please let me buy some outside.
no. You have to stay here.
it's like staying in jail here.
alright. If you want to go out let Xiao Ling go with you.
thank you.
excuse me, do you have whisky?
no, sir.
vodka?
no, sir.
let me treat you to some cola.
two cans of cola, please.
I want wine, though.
but there's no wine here.
grandpa's wine is home-brewed.
people who live here were either born here, or are ninjas who hide here.
they don't want to be ninjas...but they still follow the way of the ninja.
no wine to drink.
and no cigarettes either.
all people here are ninjas?
roughly half.
here you go.
thank you, sister.
What're they doing?
shuriken.
ninjas are poor people Most weapons are self-made.
there're 4 basic rules of a ninja.
no misuse of Ninjutsu.
abandon all self-respect.
keep everything secret.
never reveal your identity.
Dr. Kikuchi's upper class your grandpa's mid-class.
so which class are you?
upper class excel in wishful thinking.
middle class master Ninjitsu Commanders in battles.
lower class act as soldiers.
they perform missions and fight in battles.
grandpa told me to save you Maybe I'm of the lower class.
but the way of the ninja is inherited Grandpa doesn't want to be a ninja.
I think I'm a normal person who can use Ninjitsu.
that means I belong to..Upper class.
Why?
poor me. No wine. I need patience.
upper class patience...
master Basho...
please make more herbs for my wife.
feel better now?
I slept well. No insomnia.
I always told her...Iga's medicines are better than Koga's.
she just doesn't believe it.
I was from Koga Normal to support it.
we're together already.
it's pointless to separate the two clans.
IgA and Koga were from the same origin.
if the clans had paid homage to rival Lords 30 years ago, It wouldn't have become a feud.
my wife and I wouldn't have been rivals when we were born, and could only marry here.
you said you'll never mention it!
Sorry...this is the last time.
God knows! Here's the medicine.
no need to come back when you're healed up.
thank you.
thank you. We're going.
Thanks.
are you all right?
Yes.
how many years have they lived here?
about 2 years.
do they live their lives of Kirikakure here...to quit from the clans' old grudge?
so how about you?
I'll never want everything out of my own will.
I'll never want to kill those who I don't know are good or bad.
and I don't want to live in the house of another...like a slave, and with constant danger.
Hibiki, you should consider...to stop an inhuman life.
he won't even if I will.
I want to ask you one thing.
was my Lord... killed by Koga Clan's Tora?
who cares?
a ninja should know...Who kills who is out of their control.
they're only assigned to kill.
to live or to die. This is destiny.
need help?
no, thanks. Just help us to eat.
let's eat. Thank you.
so many dishes.
Cheers. Cheers.
this time it tastes interesting.
why no vegetables?
more meat makes you healthier.
ninjas can't eat meat.
let me guess...Meat produces smells.
ninjas will easily be found.
meat makes ninjas too fat to flip...and perform difficult moves.
practice makes perfect.
you'll do it if you persist.
meat is not a problem.
drink more green tea and you won't get fat.
shower more often to keep the smell away.
to stop odor from the mouth...this is for you.
if you still bear these rules in mind Iga and Koga clans'll never be together again.
alright!
Bravo! How a big piece it is!
have more.
have some wine!
I'm from Iga and you Koga.
it's destined...we can never be together.
I hope I won't face you in battle.
I must tell you... I'll never forget you.
nor shall I.
staying up so late?
I can't sleep. And you?
waiting for my friend.
master Basho.
now that you're in Kirikakure Village.
will you still care for the matters of the outside world?
there're still something I must care for.
it seems you can't be a normal person.
you still have something on your mind.
and you can't be a complete ninja.
you still have emotions.
Mr. Brian. As long as we have "Jinrui" We're still the most influential vaccine producer.
I think the Crimson Box is not the key factor.
I don't just make vaccines. I'll use "Jinrui" to make viruses and spread'em, and then sell the vaccines.
and I'll be the most influential person in the world.
Lord, are you looking for me?
Yes.
I ordered you to find "Jinrui" but you made a mistake.
now the Crimson Box is still useless.
how long should I stay here?
grandpa'll decide it.
are you...in a hurry to go?
it's bad to live here.
your grandpa's wine's no good And flies everywhere.
lucky that he's a good guy.
unlike all the rats in the city.
and you treat me so well...
play with me.
where to? Right there.
seems dangerous.
it's safe enough.
don't fear. I'm right here to teach you shuriken.
try it.
sure.
what?
have you brought a sword?
of course.
where? Get down!
marvelous! Anything else?
see it?
no.
let me teach you.
it's too cruel. Not my style.
I like you ninjas'...speed, especially when you change clothes.
can you show me slowly?
you little pervert!
pervert? At least I'm a musician.
Really? Sure.
alright, children. Pay me after you've listened to it.
there's a light show in the market tonight. Let's go together.
I'm not going. You go there.
sure, old Mr Basho should take more rest.
you joke at my grandpa?
I just watch after him.
okay. You two play together and have fun.
and be cautious.
and watch after Copy!
no need to worry your Ninjitsu's so great.
Hibiki, go play with them.
sure, let's go together!
let's go.
gimme gimme gimme!
write down your wish and tie it up with the stone. Throw it up to the Wishing Tree and your wish'll come true.
write them.
don't peek. It won't come true if seen by others.
write it down.
but I have no wish.
is it true or false?
both true and false.
what a pity.
Hibiki, don't you think so?
Yes.
ready, 1, 2, 3!
Lord, I shall fulfill your wish! Middle class ninja for Iga Clan.
grandpa...
grandpa?
grandpa?
grandpa?
grandpa?
where is grandpa?
don't worry, Xiao Ling.
ninjas always go without notice.
grandpa hasn't done this for 10 years.
and he's no longer a ninja.
he can wander around.
where were you, grandpa?
I found the Red Box for Kikuchi.
copy, open it now!
let me take "Jinrui" to the Worldwide Plague Prevention Center to fulfill the wish of Kikuchi.
I'm not cheating you, Mr. Basho.
I really don't know how to open the box.
think about it Perhaps you just forgot.
how do I think about it I'm seeing it for the first time...
is this a box?
no keyhole. Any key is useless.
I've killed Tora Daisuke.
the mission is too successful.
always keep it safe.
listen to grandpa. Stay here.
Where's the Crimson Box?
I don't know!
Where's Copy?
I don't know!
hang on!
who you killed was only a double.
tora, the box is right here.
the villagers are innocent.
I'll give the Red Box to you once you leave.
and I'll take Copy with me.
no, you can't take Copy!
grandpa!
grandpa...
grandpa...
stop it!
No! No!
if you touch anyone I'm gonna kill myself!
and you'll never open the box!
stop!
open it.
if I open it now you'll kill all the villagers.
I'll open it somewhere else, or...I'll kill myself.
go.
get away!
grandpa...
grandpa...
you two can't beat Tora's gang.
don't think about revenge.
why don't you write grandpa's name on it?
ninjas never leave a name.
so...They won't leave their names in graves.
Mr. Basho said that he only want to...be a normal person, and doesn't want to be a ninja.
interested in opening the box now?
not in the mood.
give him some wine.
sure.
thank you...
don't think I'm afraid I do like wine.
interested in opening the box now?
no, not yet.
what if I give you $10, 000, 000?
honestly, I do like money.
but these days I think conscience is vital.
I think I have conscience now.
even if I don't you can't give me either.
what do you lack and want then?
I'm a musician.
I want to find someone with the same taste.
it's simple.
I'm a music fan. I can be the one.
you sit so far away, but I can still feel your heart is only filled with goddamn money and fame.
this kind of person doesn't know about music.
seems like a waste of breath.
let's get back to the Crimson Box.
so when will you open it then?
honestly I'm feeling good now.
but I forgot how to open it.
hope this guy can help you remember.
if you can't open the box before dawn tomorrow, the heads of every villagers will be in front of you.
is there any other way?
it's decided, Xiao Ling.
strong wind blows tonight.
sure. North wind.
it seems to blow towards here, doesn't it?
the one who knows music...
nobody understands my music.
I never heard it before.
it's my own work.
romance of Others.
it's great.
thank you.
how do I address you?
copy.
can you play it once more?
nobody understands my music!
open the door!
there's something strange on the surface of the water.
sink it!
you sons of bitches!
Yes, Lord.
there's a boat straight!
breathing pipes Must be dropped from the boat.
we're trapped!
they're gone Go to the rooftop and look.
rooftop!
two ninjas're coming.
Lord, I'm gonna take a look.
the Red Box, the Key Master and myself are the most important.
all right here Where else are you going?
you stay with Martin.
you, go with the others!
tell me how to open the box!
what did you do just then?
speak out! How do I open it?
kill me and you'll never open the box.
what's going on outside?
Mr. Brian, nobody's responding.
nobody's responding...
Lord, the enemy is near.
I must go out and see.
watch me. Don't go too far.
Yes, Lord.
I won't play with you anymore.
I tell you. I give you $10 million to be "the one."
open the box. Or I'll shoot you dead at once!
and I'll never think of the box again.
don't move!
I'll help you...your boss to open it.
so, what's the use for this?
the box needs music as a voice control.
it opened before because I whistled.
why don't you whistle now?
you don't get it. Now...I need to use a flute.
shoot me if you don't believe me. Come on!
check it.
cool it! Look at him...
look at him! Calm down!
don't force me, Hibiki.
tell them to stop where they are.
stop doing nonsense!
look ahead.
stop it!
stop it!
No...don't shoot...
open the Red Box or I'll kill her.
open it!
you can't open the box, Copy.
now only three people will die.
if he gets "Jinrui," thousands of people will get killed.
don't worry about me.
I understand, but...I can't watch you die!
why didn't you stay with me...and forget about all of this?
if he hurt her he must be shocked.
she could then grab the chance and kill Tora.
but the plan may sacrifice her life...
buddy Spray. I haven't eaten anything today.
hold on.
wait there I'm making some food now.
it's me again. Still alive.
I fainted that day.
then woke up and found myself on a boat floating in the sea.
I then took the map and asked...where Kirikakure Village is.
nobody in the world knows.
I am the only one who's heard of it.
sometimes I wonder if it was a dream.
these days there's a brand new medicine.
it can cure headache, fever, constipation, diarrhea heart attack, tuberculosis...rheumatics, Parkinson's disease, avian flu, SARS and AIDS as well!
it costs as low as a can of cola.
real savior for the poor.
produced by the Worldwide Plague Prevention Center
but I remember...I never did open the Crimson Box.
buddy Spray.
thank you. You're welcome...
you steal?
you...
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
where is Kirikakure Village?
kids, something for you.
see what it is.
there you are.
you got new wishes?
I fear the wind will blow away the wishes of the villagers. So I'm tying them up with red string.
and you?
I'm looking for something I left here.
your flute? At the medicine shop.
take it yourself.
now I have a dream...
can I see it? Go ahead.
no, I won't. Why?
what if you wrote something erotic?
you figured it out I'm taking the flute.
I'll open it faster than you!
Oh, Susan, I- I found your earring this morning on our rug.
John and Cherie Hyatt. You think we're wild?
try spending a weekend with the two of them.
what's cookin', good-lookin'?
what's cooking is a batch of my brownies.
I got fired today.
Janet didn't... - Janet doesn't know.
can't you see what's right in front of you?
I- I have a wife, Melinda.
and I have an apartment right around the corner.
um, I'm gonna grab a shower.
maybe Tom and Trina are having a pool party.
Tom, will you dig up a pair of shorts for Roger?
wow, no wonder Janet keeps Roger under lock and key.
you got some sun today.
does that hurt?
not too bad.
Tom had sex with someone in Tokyo.
th-that's cheating, isn't it?
we'll work through it.
maybe tonight could be the night we go back to your place.
I like where we are right now.
you still want to take it slow.
I have something to tell you, Janet.
that you got fired? - I need more.
you got it.
midnight at the oasis send your camel to bed shadows paintin' our faces...
you look like you could use some suntan oil, Susan.
heaven's holdin' a half-moon...
sure.
shinin' just for us Let's slip off...
I'll do the other side.
don't forget her legs.
kick up a little dust, Come on...
mind if I take over?
cactus is our friend...
as long as that's okay with you.
come on... Till the evenin' ends. Till the evenin' ends. You don't have to answer...
Susan, what are you doing?
Bruce, w- we didn't. I didn't.
it- It isn't what it looks like.
is it?
heathens. To think, all this time...
my husband and my best friend.
so much for open and honest, huh, Susan?
Shh-shh-shh- shh-shh-shh.
sorry, sorry.
I- I was trying not to wake you.
what time is it? - It's early. I... couldn't sleep.
I... thought I'd catch the first train into the city.
it's okay.
go back to sleep.
I'll see you at dinner.
go back to sleep.
Hey, I found last summer's Puzzlerama board in the shed.
hard to believe it's been a whole year since the last one.
new year, new neighbors, new secrets.
you think Bruce and Susan are ready for a party like this?
things got kind of heated last year.
Ah, it's all in good fun, just ???
I'll make sure they're prepped.
any secrets about me floating around in there?
Ah, ah, ah, all's fair in love and Puzzlerama.
same rules apply to us as everyone else.
you're wicked.
I'm an open book.
it's secrets that are wicked.
have a seat, honey. Breakfast is ready.
thank you.
now, I circled a few places for you to call this morning.
all this talk of a bad economy, seems like there's plenty of opportunity for a man like yourself.
Thanks, but I'm not sure I'm what these companies are looking for.
nonsense. Look, um...
strong, motivated self-starter "who doesn't intimidate easily or take no for an answer."
you can be those things.
executive debt collector?
sounds more like a job for Charles Bronson, not for me.
you know what's not for me?
???
come on, we've got enough savings to get us through at least six months.
I don't want to get stuck doing something I'm going to hate the rest of my life.
well, I don't want that either, but you have to have a plan.
do you have a plan, Roger?
I do.
I'm off to the library.
don't worry so much.
where on earth did these come from?
Susan, I am so upset.
Janet, what's wrong?
I must have done at least ten loads of laundry since the cabin.
and do you think Roger even had the decency to throw these in the hamper?
the cabin? - Bruce's swim trunks must have gotten mixed up with Roger's. I am so sorry.
Oh, God, Janet.
don't give it a second thought.
well, in Roger's defense, I'm sure he didn't know he had them.
he hasn't exactly been himself lately.
Oh?
turns out Roger's promotion isn't all it's cracked up to be.
what do you mean?
well, hopefully, it's just a bump in the road. Uh...
I, I shouldn't even be bothering you with this.
you're not bothering me.
is, is there anything I can do to help?
maybe there is.
if you could get Bruce to give Roger a little encouragement to, you know, stay the corporate course, perhaps he'd listen to him.
a- Are you two free for bridge tomorrow?
actually, um,
Trina has got this block party scavenger hunt thing tomorrow.
scavenger hunt? Sounds exciting.
would you like to join us?
to your block party?
well, it's Tom and Trina's.
I'm, I'm sure the invitation is open.
well, I do love good competion.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to get Roger out there mingling with people who are... connected.
great.
so we'll do this together.
Hey, you're back from camp.
Yeah.
I've been trying to reach you on the walkie-talkie.
Oh, I wasn't sure when you were coming home, so... I turned it off.
Oh.
Oh, cute.
I made something for you.
what is it?
a wish bag.
it's got feathers and tree bark, some river stones.
it's for good luck.
it's almost time for dinner.
you want to invite your friend to stay?
Oh, that's okay. I, I got to go.
Thanks.
see you.
cute.
Thanks.
wearing cologne again today.
uh, yeah, whatever's left from this morning.
how was your day?
good, uh... uneventful.
yours?
fine.
What'd you do today, kiddo?
nothing.
want to know what I did?
Yes. - Sure.
volunteered for the Carter campaign.
you're not even old enough to vote.
I know, but I figured the least I could do is convince people who are voting to kick Nixon's lackey out of the White House.
ford isn't all bad.
he pardoned Nixon.
mom, how do you deal with this?
by avoiding the subject.
all Nixon did was keep a secret he shouldn't have.
he handled it wrong.
it's not unforgivable.
he's the biggest liar ever put into office.
you know, it's pretty easy to be an idealist when you're young, Laur.
people aren't always as black and white as you think.
I'll get it.
Hi.
are we interrupting dinner? - It's fine, believe me.
Hey, Bruce, long time, no see. - Tom, what's up?
we're just setting up for the party tomorrow.
at our house?
Yup. Your house, our house, all over the neighborhood, actually.
it's a scavenger hunt, remember?
uh, no.
it's Puzzlerama.
Puzzlerama?
think truth or dare on a roller coaster.
now, you don't have to participate if you don't want to.
a lot of guests prefer to play it safe on the sidelines.
no one would think any less of you.
uh, well, I-I don't have a problem...
u- unless...
uh, Susan has a problem?
no, no problem.
you should know I told Janet about the party, so I think she and Roger are probably going to come by, and I'm sure she'll insist on playing.
you know, when...
Janet plays a game, she usually plays to win.
I remember, we played Twister up at your cabin.
so what do you need us to do?
just step outside and give me two minutes alone.
okay. O- kay.
uh, you, too, dear.
pace yourselves.
Hey, Trina. - Bruce.
is that right?
Howard, Sheila. Glad to have you two back.
you're good sports.
Oh, Trina, do you have a second?
I have something for you.
Oh, and I have something for you.
my earring.
from the night we met.
I've been meaning to get it back to you all summer.
what do you have for me?
Janet brought them over yesterday.
she thought that they were Bruce's, from the cabin.
Oh, well, that explains it.
explains what?
Oh, I spotted them in your bedroom last night.
got me wondering what you and Roger might have been up to after our pool party the other day.
I hope you're joking.
I am.
why aren't you laughing?
Roger didn't tell Janet that he spent the afternoon at your house, and it would crush Janet if she knew.
Hi. - Oh, hi.
how fun is this?
Hi.
hello. I don't know that we've ever even seen the backyard in daylight.
it is stunning.
look at that view, Roger.
sure is something.
so how does this whole thing work?
Susan and I run around trying to solve puzzles or something?
Oh, it won't be you and Susan.
you know Trina-- she likes to keep things interesting.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
isn't that your trading buddy?
Yeah, Mareno, though I'm not sure he's such a buddy
did you invite him? - No, not me.
who's that little rocket with him?
Oh, Melinda, she works with us.
nice to have an office with a view.
Trina, looking forward to seeing who you paired us off with this year.
I'm sure you are.
Hey, babe.
how are our friends, the Hyatts?
looking for trouble, as always.
honey, I need you to keep an eye out for Janet today.
you know how this party can get a little racy.
you got it.
Oh, Trina, have you seen Stu?
not since the Fourth of July.
I was beginning to think you had a very dark secret to reveal this year, Gail.
I wish.
Hey.
I see you didn't come alone.
just like you told me. - Perfect.
my husband won't suspect a thing.
Oh, this is all very exciting.
we haven't seen you since the, uh... since the benefit.
right.
Trina, where did you get this stained glass?
it's gorgeous.
Oh, I took a class a couple years ago and made it for our first Puzzlerama.
you made this? - Mm-hmm.
well, I knew you were crafty, but not... crafty.
winner gets to take it home until next year.
I know just the spot for it.
I wish you the best of luck.
Tom? Are we ready with those drinks?
Yes, ma'am. - Great.
everyone, please join me in a Puzzlerama-rita.
here you are.
now, everyone,
I know most of you have been to Puzzlerama before, some of you several times, but there are some brave new competitors this year, so let's begin by welcoming each other to this annual event in the spirit of community in which it's given.
we all know how toxic secrets can be...
so a few years ago,
I designed this friendly little event to help set ourselves free.
now, every year, everyone with a secret is fair game.
that includes myself and Tom.
the riddles are chosen and put on the board at random, and the answers can only be revealed by those who know the truth.
the team who unravels the most neighborhood mysteries wins.
everyone got it?
Yeah. - Yep. - Good.
to Puzzlerama.
Puzzlerama!
and now, for the teams.
inside the bottom of your glass is a colored mark.
find the other person with the same color, and you've got your teammate.
I've got red.
it looks like it's you and me, Jan.
uh, I'm orange.
I got green.
green.
who's got blue?
Oh, I...
I've got blue right here.
well, what do you know?
here's yellow.
who's got yellow?
I do.
you're orange. I guess we're matched up.
uh, yeah, uh, looks like.
players, if you'd please, don your team medallions.
okay, okay, remember, this is a race against the clock, as well as each other.
whichever team has collected the most puzzle pieces by 7: 00 p. m. is the winner.
are you ready?
everyone has a pad and pen?
Tom, if you'd do the honors...
question #1...
no room at the Inn?
look for a bed at this famous hotel chain, "where a fellow traveler or two "can always find comfortable lodging and maybe even a delicious sandwich.
come on.
you know the answer?
don't know, don't care.
question #2...
this dignified lady's world-famous recipe must be made from scratch, "but scratch her surface and you'll find a whirling twister "waiting to break out of the box.
find the box, and it's a slam 'Dunc'.
so this is awkward, huh?
what are you doing here?
Oh, Mareno set it up.
I didn't know you'd be here until I walked in.
and team orange?
fate, I guess. - Right. - Question #3...
a taxi driver's hooker might get shady with these.
if you know which lady favors the shady in her parlor, then you know where to collect your next piece.
look, about the other night... - No need to explain.
I think you helped us both dodge a bullet.
not that I felt that way at the time.
I was pretty sauced. - Yeah, me, too.
a new arrival found Daddy's box of birds and bees.
gather from this spot where men let women pick them up.
you were a perfect gentleman.
not so perfect.
Hi. We met at the benefit.
uh, you remember my wife, Susan. - Right.
good to see you again.
I was gonna grab a quick drink. Uh, should I get more than one?
uh, I'm fine. - Uh, whatever you're having.
you didn't mention Melinda was coming.
Yeah, Mareno invited her.
who invited Mareno?
our neighbor behind the Foster Grants.
the shady lady.
what?
well, you two have fun. - You and Roger, too.
okay. Good luck.
question #5...
don't you want someone you can actually trust representing you?
I haven't thought about it.
okay, okay, just tell me one successful thing Ford has done since taking office, except for sweeping Watergate under the rug, - because that's... - I'm sorry, I don't have time.
excuse me.
what is wrong with people?
don't they read the newspaper?
friendly advice?
just stick to the script.
slow and steady, one signature at a time.
what is it with you and the slow and steady?
how can you be so calm all the time?
because this election isn't about emotions, it's about facts.
see, how can you say that?
whatever happens in November is going to change people's lives.
Yeah, I agree with you; I just don't think alarming people is gonna help them switch candidates.
but... you do it your way; I'll do it mine.
I bet I can get more signatures than you.
like a real bet?
winner gets...
final say for the rest of the night.
final say?
on everything.
you're on.
let's go over there. - All right.
let's go.
Mrs. Thompson? - Hello, Laurie.
could I just please have a moment of your time...
not now, Laurie.
all right, "a dignified lady's world-famous recipe.
obviously, that's me and my brownies.
and Twister...
well...
now, "waiting to break out of the box..."
I'm thinking box of brownies. Store-bought, right?
man, you sure know your way around a market.
brownie mix, brownie mix, brownie mix. Aha!
slam 'Dunc'"-- look.
I think I've been paired with a ringer.
okay. quickly, help get these boxes back before anyone else comes.
all right...
no room at the Inn? Try this hotel chain.
what is Trina talking about?
where do you two like to stay?
in Best Western, Sheraton, Hilton?
what does she mean by sandwich?
John and Cherie Hyatt.
EW.
I love this game!
here I thought all your parties were just drunken orgies.
well, they can't all be perfect.
what do you think?
you ready to check into the Hyatt? - Lead the way.
what kind of recipe?
I have no idea.
Wow! Are you, uh, are you sure this is where we're supposed to be?
I think so.
taxi Driver hooker has to be Jodie Foster.
and they don't come a whole lot shadier than Gail and her Foster Grant sunglasses.
it's, uh, quite, quite a setup she's got in here.
Yeesh.
you know, I've got to say, the best part about losing my job has been getting to hang out with you.
I feel like I made a new friend.
me too.
but no more secrets. Okay?
when Janet showed up yesterday with those swim trunks, I about died.
well, next time I play hooky, we'll make sure to get both our stories straight.
I might've found what we were looking for.
right? Maybe?
are you guys done in here?
we're done. - Yup. Uh-huh.
vamoose!
come and get it.
a new arrival found daddy's box of birds and bees, "gathered from this spot where men let women pick them up.
the train station.
it's a real page-turner.
gotta be the magazines.
I don't-- I don't think she hid any of those in there, Melinda.
what do you mean? Why not?
uh, well they sell other ones, uh, not on display.
Oh, right. Birds and bees.
Yeah, I, uh, kind of recognize the clue.
uh, would you mind if we took a look in your private section?
men only.
give me a break, Ralph.
man, all right.
there you go.
big and Bawdy?
panty Party?
we all have our weaknesses.
Bruce, I have to confess something.
Mareno was never my date tonight.
not really.
I knew you'd be here, so I agreed I'd come with him.
are you mad?
that you're not on a date with Mareno? No.
my God, I cannot believe you actually buy these.
do you want to win or not?
always. - All right.
Thanks, buddy.
how do you know this is where Bruce buys his porno?
it's where every guy buys his porno.
Ralph's newsstand is an institution.
you should have seen this box that Bruce had.
it must've taken years to accumulate that much smut.
you'd be surprised.
I made a mistake.
this isn't the spot.
I thought you said it was an institution?
do you trust me?
I trust you.
then come on. We're wasting time.
I swear, I'll never understand men as long as I live.
clue #6...
on a festive, restive night, "who reached out for her Independence, "but lost her gold hoop?
the jury's still out, "but 'mill' around in her case awhile, and you'll have your answer.
anything else look familiar, Bruce?
uh... no.
I have an idea.
why don't we look around for another team that's stuck and barter for information?
you never stop thinking, do you?
let's go get a drink, buddy.
okay.
word of advice:
never dip your pen in the company ink.
I saw you and your little prot? g? over there lip-locked at the train station.
no, it's not like that.
well, another couple of seconds, you'd be explaing this to Janet, not me.
what are you boys over here whispering about?
work stuff.
time's almost up.
a couple of teams are getting really close.
where did Melinda run off to?
uh, I-I think Melinda and I are, uh, uh, bowing out gracefully.
Hmm... - "Hmm" indeed.
you've got stories, don't you?
which we'll save till next year.
so what's your excuse, mister?
Where's Janet?
right over...
she was just at the board.
thank you, ma'am. You're making the right decision for your country, for the Democratic party, and for yourself.
uh, excuse me, sir, ma'am.
are you ready to make the next step towards change?
mom?
what are you guys doing here?
Oh, right-- scavenger hunt.
no wonder everyone's acting insane.
Hi, I'm Susan.
how are ya? - Sorry, right.
mom, Mr. Thompson, this is my...
Mr. Stephens. Doug.
he was my teacher over the summer.
Oh...
I-I've heard so much about you.
it's nice to finally meet you.
likewise.
Where's Dad?
he's on-on another team.
well, there's definitely a clue or something in there.
okay, well, I'll go check it out.
uh, look by the Duncan Hines.
I didn't realize this volunteer work was, uh, school-sponsored.
Oh, no, it's not.
we, uh, try to keep a nonpartisan campus.
so then...
Doug and I share similar interests.
uh, here it is.
right where you thought it would be.
your mom's a really good player.
did you guys find the one at our house yet?
uh, you know, I think that this game's just about run out of time.
Roger, we better head back and check in with Bruce and Janet.
okay.
Laurie, it was good seeing you. And it was a pleasure to meet you.
nice to meet you.
look, I think maybe we should, uh...
tally the signatures?
who ever wins can decide what we do after that.
can we get back to the game?
what I was going to ask you though was, um...
could you excuse us?
sorry. - Thanks.
I think those two are willing to swap information with us, among other things.
rumor has it one of these clues leads to your bedroom...
I think we got to call it a night.
Why? Did I do something wrong?
no, no.
I- I did.
I- I'm a married man.
I- I love my wife.
I- I'll take a spin for Mareno, and see if he's in any shape to get you home.
forget Mareno. I'll take the train.
Melinda, I'm sorry.
I'm not.
I'll see you Monday.
okay.
what are you doing?
my mom put me on Stu watch.
you can't go inside. Door's locked.
here-- hope you win.
that was easy. - Yeah.
grab a chair.
freaks just keep on coming.
Shh! We've got to go.
if Stu asks, we were never here. Got it?
Yeah. Oh...
Gail, what are you doing? Let's go.
let's go!
come on, let's go!
you and Team Pink are in a tie for first place.
Hey! Drink? - No, I'm good.
I'm assuming you found the piece with the brownie mix?
Yep, very clever.
and what about...?
the one in my bedroom? Mm-hmm. We didn't go there.
still a little time, you know.
it wasn't a coincidence, you putting me with Roger today, was it?
I thought you'd make a good team.
evidently I was right.
same with Bruce and Melinda?
actually, Bruce was supposed to be with Gail.
I'm not sure what happened there.
you're a slut, Gail!
Stu! - You go to hell!
honey!
guess things don't always work out the way you imagined.
no matter how carefully you plan them.
Roger is my best friend's husband.
I don't want you to think that you see something happening there that isn't.
don't worry. No.
all I saw was a great team that can win it all if they wanted to.
well, winning isn't everything.
Hey, Jan,
found the gold hoop at Susan's house.
and I think you were wrong about the train station.
if we go back for that piece, I think we can win it all.
well, that's it, everyone. Times up.
wait, wait, we have three minutes.
come on, Jan. You did good, huh. Let me pour you a drink.
we'll just call this year's game a tie.
Hey, hey, hey, one tie, we all tie.
no, the game is not over until someone wins!
Trina, what do you do in event of a tie?
break it.
one final question. - Okay, okay.
everyone...
okay.
every marriage needs reorienting when the skies get bumpy.
sometimes the right gesture can make the flight as smooth as silk.
...you know? Reorienting, bumpy skies-- You're a pilot.
did you and Trina have a fight recently?
uh, yeah, kinda.
and what does the silk mean? Think!
I brought her back a kimono from Tokyo to apologize.
that's it! We got it! Okay.
...we all tie! One tie, we all tie!
I can see why they only throw this party once a year.
I'll say. - ...we all tie!
one tie, we all tie!
there isn't going to be a tie.
I found out your secret, Trina.
maybe you'd like to explain why there's a half-naked photograph of my husband hidden in your closet.
Janet, I'm-I'm sorry...
aren't there enough men hopping in and out of your bed without trying to seduce mine, too?
it's not what you think, Janet.
you know about this?
Yes.
I was here, too. - Janet,
I went over to Susan's the day the power went out to talk to her about losing my job.
you...
you knew about that, too?
Roger came over to get some advice.
he didn't want to disappoint you.
Janet... - Well, so-so naturally, you told him that rather than go home and discuss the fact that he got fired with his wife, he should head over here and have a field day with the swingers?
no, it wasn't like that.
Oh, really, Trina?
anyone else lose an earring that day?
there.
I win.
I think you know what you can do with that question mark.
all right, I didn't know I'd be having company, so don't make any comments I won't recover from.
don't be a sore loser.
hit the lights.
it's exactly what I imagined.
good or bad?
passion vs. Intellect by Doug Stephens.
it's my master's thesis.
so, which one wins?
passion or intellect?
tonight? Passion, no contest.
you got way more signatures than I did.
which means I get final say, all night.
that was the bet.
so.
what do you want to do next?
let's take turns reading to each other from your essay.
Really?
no.
not really.
aren't you gonna even let me explain?
why should I?
you got so good at lying, how would I know what the truth was anyway?
you want to know why I didn't tell you about the job? This is why.
I didn't want to put you through this.
put me through this?
Roger, if you think this is about your job, this is not about your stupid job.
this is about you confiding in another woman instead of turning to me...
...your wife.
things always have to be so perfect with you, Janet.
our whole marriage I've tried to get it right.
I love you.
but it's not so easy to talk to you.
not if I don't have the right answer.
what are you talking about?
I'm sorry.
Sorry， I didn't tell you about the afternoon Roger and I spent at the Deckers.
so why didn't you?
do you tell me everything you do every single day?
no.
but I assume you tell me the important stuff, right?
and this wasn't important?
it... it was to Roger.
he didn't want everyone to know that he'd lost his job and...
I honored that.
the last thing I want is to keep secrets from you.
me, too.
that's it then.
no more secrets.
well, packed the puzzle board away.
maybe you should have burned it.
party took a bit of a left turn, huh?
I never meant for anyone to get hurt, - least of all Janet. - Everyone knows that.
look,
Janet and Roger, and Susan and Bruce
they're not exactly like us.
nor should they be.
open and honest doesn't always mean easy.
don't we know it.
Yeah.
you ready for bed?
Hey, on the bright side, there's nothing left out there that can hurt anyone, right?
well, congratulations, Bruce.
what's interesting?
our new neighbors.
they look happy.
I'm Susan. - Trina Decker.
this is my husband Tom.
welcome to the neighborhood-- if you'd like to share, why don't you bring it to our party tomorrow night.
what' d I say, nothing left, huh?
take it easy.
Bye!
my family's moving, so...
uh, that's it, everyone.
Mr. Stephens. Have a good weekend.
times have changed, mom.
women can decide if and when they want to have sex with someone.
so, are you? Having sex?
I wanted you to run to the A&P. We're out of tin foil.
are you running away?
you should mind your own business.
the new neighbors invited us over for a drink. That's all.
out with the old, in with the new.
why don't you join us?
yeah it's the new kids in town.
you and Tom have an open marriage?
honestly, opening our relationship was the best thing that ever happened to me and Tom.
Quaalude?
uh, Trina? I was trying to find Susan. Have you seen her?
she was heading towards the basement.
down the hall, second door on the left.
what's in the basement?
the playroom.
you won't believe what kind of party this is.
we don't... we don't belong here.
we're gonna stay.
great hands, Susan. Soft.
why don't the four of us go someplace a littl quieter?
Ooh, hot apple pie.
now that's the way to start off a week.
pie not for you.
Oh, come on, just one tiny little slice? - Sorry.
Oh, for pete's sake, Janet, let the man have some pie.
God knows the poor guy can use a little pie.
something smells good.
relax, Jan.
it's-it's Janet.
relax, Janet.
they're your good hands. You both are.
is anybody gonna get that?
don't answer.
but what if it's... - I know who it is.
you can't avoid her forever, Janet.
and besides, isn't tonight card night?
just let it ring. Morning, Ricky.
sit down, I'll whip up some eggs.
hon? What does this tie say about me?
you know, second week with the new firm, it's time to make an impression.
I like you in navy.
I'm playing in a whole different league now, Sue. I gotta dress the part.
don't forget, tonight's bridge night with the Thompsons.
we're still doing that?
good question. I haven't been able to get ahold of Janet since...
what, since we brought them to a swinger's party on saturday night?
Bruce, we are not swingers.
Oh, my God. What did we do?
nothing everybody else. Else isn't doing.
we're not everybody else. - I know-- we're still just Bruce and Susan.
and don't forget, Janet and Roger are the ones who left.
let's make a pact.
let's promise that it'll only be that one time.
you got it.
you want to go for a run?
Oh, I think I just had my exercise for the day. Thank you.
come on, before it gets too hot.
Hello?
you got him.
what, a pilot call in sick?
really.
all right, well, give me an hour, all right?
I've been summoned by corporate.
why, what's going on?
I'm not sure.
could have something to do with all that talk about adding a non-stop to Tokyo.
do you think they'll offer you the route?
they can offer me whatever they want.
I have no interest in spending my nights 10, 000 miles away from you.
here, genius.
morning, guys.
cupboards are kinda bare, mom.
well, I'm headed to the store later, if you want to add something to the list.
how about everything? We just moved.
big day, Beej? - Not really.
then I need this more than you. You have a good day, kids.
Hey, hey, I'll see you tonight?
okay?
are you guys acting weird?
what makes you say that?
dad forgot his briefcase.
morning, Bruce.
Trina-- You're up early.
always.
Yeah, I guess I... I figured you and Tom more for the evening types.
well, nights are good, too.
so how are you and Susan? I haven't seen you since the...
Yeah, yeah, we're-we're good.
great party.
Hi, Susan!
uh, uh, Trina was just, uh, I was just walking out and-and here she was, just...
I was just heading out for a run.
Susan, I, I found your earring this morning on our rug, in case you were looking for it.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
the backing must've fallen off.
it happens to me all the time.
come by and pick it up anytime.
uh, well, I better get going, if I'm gonna catch the train.
do you, want a ride?
Nah, nah, gotta get my blood pumping.
but if you want to pick me up tonight, I'll be on the 6: 00.
I'll see you, ladies.
so, Susan, what's your day like?
Oh, just... errands, and house stuff, grocery store.
well, let me know if you'd like any company.
mine's wide open.
Hi, Helen!
captain Decker. Thanks for coming down.
that'll be all, Mary.
thank you, Mr.Metner.
sure is nice working with pretty girls.
one of the perks of the industry.
not that I have to tell you.
Oh, no, sir.
please.
understand you married one of our stews a few years back.
Yeah, she's retired, now.
most of them do when they reach a certain age.
the rest of them just keep getting younger and younger.
like that pretty little trainee on your Miami route-- Tammy Matthews.
Yeah, yeah, nice kid. What about her?
spilled hot coffee on you during your approach on Friday, is that right?
there was a little turbulence, on the plane; no big deal.
that's not all she spilled, Tom.
kid's been talking to some of the other girls about, uh, sharing playtime with you and your wife.
Yeah, well, that was all off the clock.
no, no, no, it's not the point.
see, with all these women's libbers out there, a girl like Tammy could make serious trouble for us.
so this'll be your last week on the Miami route.
am I being fired?
of course not.
your flying record is flawless.
in fact, when we announce service to Tokyo next week, I want you at the helm of that 747.
you're being promoted. Congratulations.
Oh, excuse me.
uh, I thought you'd be shopping on the other side of town now.
Janet... I've been calling and calling.
well, forgive me for not waiting by the phone.
Janet, wait.
I'm sorry about the other night.
we should've left the party with you and Roger.
then why didn't you?
Hey, Susan!
buy one, get one free-- I couldn't resist.
Trina, fancy running into you here.
well, I was just tagging along with Susan for company.
how sweet of you.
Trina, would you excuse us for a minute?
I'll be up front.
this is so awkward...
who you spend time with is none of my business.
of course it is, you're my best friend.
are we still on for bridge tonight?
actually, we're not.
uh, Roger and I made other plans.
if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner party to plan.
biggest hypocrite I know! You know what?
I can do do what I want to do and there is nothing you can do!
is getting hopeless on that stuff!
that is a load of crap and...
every time I try to...
please! Spare me the lecture.
Gail, shut up!
I'm sick of you making a federal case...cause I like to have a good time! - Yeah? Yeah?
and since when did you become an angel anyway?
Gail, you're a junkie! - Where are you going?
I'm leaving! - Stu...
go to hell! - wait!
No! No!
don't you leave me! I'm sorry!
all right, welcome back, everyone.
I think you'll be very happy to hear today marks the official midway point for our summer session.
I, uh, hope you all found time to enjoy your existential freedom over our bicentennial.
I know I spent time enjoying your essays on Kierkegaard, and, as it seems more than one of you struggled to find appropriate literary comparisons to draw from, I thought I might offer you all a chance to pull some extra credit.
in the back of your essays, you' see a flyer.
it's for a non-equity production of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot.
the director is a very good friend of mine.
she has a very interesting feminist spin on the material
so, if you write a brief, honest review, I will bump up that grade on your essays by one letter.
raise your hand if you think you might be able to come.
great.
so... where should I put these?
Oh, just on the counter here is fine. - Okay.
you know, I'm sorry about everything with Janet.
believe me, she hasn't always been this tightly wound.
most of the time she's funny and thoughtful.
I-I think she's just feeling a little threatened right now.
by me.
by... change.
please tell me that Tom and I didn't scare you and Bruce off, too.
no, no, of course not.
you have to understand that that night is so...far beyond anything Bruce and I have ever done together.
well, then, I have an idea.
let's have you over for dinner tonight.
just your basic, casual evening with friends.
I think you'll see we're not so different after all.
Hey, mom.
this is my daughter Laurie.
this is Mrs.Decker, our neighbor from across the street.
the post and beam?
that's us.
it's a great house.
I love how all the glass frames the stone.
are you interested in architecture?
Laurie's interested in a lot of things.
she's our resident overachiever.
I see the resemblance.
nice meeting you.
so... what do you say to dinner?
no quaaludes, I promise.
you're back. Coming in?
you bet I am.
how was your morning? - Interesting.
tell me yours first.
how does four or five days in the Bahamas sound?
like a bribe.
you said yes to Tokyo, didn't you?
it turns out bringing young stewardesses home isn't the smartest move a captain can make, present company excluded.
well, I could have told you that.
as a matter of fact, I think I did.
you mad?
ask me from a Japanese pay phone, after we've been apart for three days.
you'll still accept the charges, right?
so... how did you spend your "interesting" morning?
with Susan.
Susan-and-Bruce Susan?
they're coming over for dinner tonight.
wow, that is interesting.
kind of thought they were a one-time thing.
well, doesn't mean we can't get to know them better.
how far do we have to drag this crap?
not much further.
I can't believe you wasted six months' allowance on camping gear for some crazy chick you barely know.
it's her mom who's crazy, not Samantha.
Oh, right-- running away to live in the woods is totally rational.
you know, I sure hope you're banging her.
I thought I told you to come alone.
who's he?
Rick. He's cool.
anyone else know you're here? - No.
we can help you set up the tent.
just leave it.
that's it? Not even a thank-you?
Thanks.
you can run home to your mom and dad now.
Yeah, she doesn't seem crazy at all.
new York desk likes our position on IBM, so stay in the money as long as possible.
Carrie, what do you got?
here you go, Bill.
size trader out of New York wants to unload his position on standard oil.
standard's trading at 40. Uh, it's a buy.
seems the word of an offshore drilling accident might be hitting the wire after we open.
Yeah, I know the market maker in the oil pit.
he'll work with me on this.
you got an in with Gilboy?
Yeah, he's kind of a mentor.
whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, cowboy, I trade standard.
soh is my baby.
sorry, Mareno, got to fill the order.
Miller, you better deliver.
all right, gents, go print some money.
all right, 15, 000 cards.
standard oil at a third.
look, standard's up to 42!
okay if I go to the library after dinner?
sure, if you bring your brother.
are you guys going out tonight?
the new neighbors invited us over.
is that what you're wearing?
Why? - I don't know.
Mrs. Decker seemed kind of stylish.
I just wouldn't want you to feel frumpy.
where have you been all day, Beej?
hanging out with Rick.
your clothes are filthy.
you have exactly 20 minutes to clean yourself up before dinner.
Frumpy?
here you are, fellas.
the, uh, the drinks are on me, gentlemen.
thank you so much. - Thank you.
all right, you know, I'd better call the wife and let her know I'm gonna be a little late.
and a little loaded. Does anybody got a dime?
here, I'll apply it against your bonus.
believe me, you got one coming.
Thanks, man.
hello.
Hey, Laurie, it's dad. I-is mom there?
no, she left to pick you up.
uh, yeah, well, I'm, uh, I'm still, uh...uh, downtown.
Yeah, could you, uh, could you write down a number and have them page me here when she gets back?
Hey, Susan. - Roger.
you here for Bruce? I don't think he was on the train.
are you sure?
I didn't see him. Wow, you, uh... you look great.
a little dressy, maybe, for a bridge game but... great.
Janet canceled tonight. Said you'd made other plans.
I didn't know that. She didn't tell me that. - It's okay.
she's been avoiding me ever since...The party, and... I don't blame her.
Roger, about the other night... - No. No, no, no, it was fun.
no, I had a good time. Really.
and you know how Janet is. She'll, she'll come around.
looks like you were right about Bruce.
can I give you a lift home?
Ah, I'm going to, I'm going to walk.
it's the only real exercise I seem to be getting these days, so...and dinner's probably already on the table.
don't want to be late for that.
Bye, Roger.
Hey, kiddo, what's for dinner?
something weird mom's cooking.
she around?
in there. With them.
Oh, roger, finally.
uh, Roger, meet Paul and Martha Hincamp.
they moved in to the Millers' old house today.
this is my husband Roger.
most nights, he's a little more punctual.
welcome to the neighborhood.
can I talk to you for a minute?
excuse us.
I thought tonight was supposed to be a night with Bruce and Susan.
well, if they can move on, so can we.
I got you a new shirt, it's upstairs on the bed.
now, hurry up and change. Dinner's almost ready.
can I freshen up anyone's drink?
Susan, come on in. Tom's still getting ready.
you look great.
Thanks, but I have bad news.
Bruce and I can't make dinner.
well, Bruce specifically.
I-I wanted to drop off this wine to apologize.
Oh, is everything okay?
apparently, he had a run of good luck this afternoon, so he's off celebrating at the Playboy Club with his trading buddies.
the Playboy Club-- now, there's an idea.
Oh, Tom's a member, too.
Oh, Bruce isn't a member. I don't think.
I say we head down there and surprise him.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, well, you can't waste that fantastic dress on a night in.
Bruce will love it.
are women even allowed?
allowed and encouraged.
let me just go dig up my key to the club.
how about a drink before we go?
gimlet, right?
Hey, Laur. Where you headed?
to the EL station.
I like the new digs.
no wonder I haven't seen you around. Probably got lost in all those rooms.
I don't have time for this, Logan.
like you said, I was, um, an idiot the other night at the beach.
just wanted to make it up to you.
Look...you're a really good guy, and I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you this summer, but we just don't have anything in common, so...
come on. Let me give you a ride wherever you're off to, and we'll talk about it.
I'm going downtown to see a play.
I love plays.
name one, and I'll take the ride.
hair.
who's up for one more?
no. Can't.
got to get home before the wife starts wondering what I'm up to.
one of a hundred reasons I never tied the knot.
I do enough lying on the trading floor.
if you marry the right girl, you don't have to lie.
that girl don't exist.
actually, she just walked in.
this is so last minute.
surprise.
what are you doing here? - Is it all right?
what, are you kidding? How did...
Oh, long story.
Bruce, good to see you. - Bruce.
what are you doing in our neck of the woods...Without so much as a phone call?
spur of the moment adventure.
Trina, you look lovely, as always.
Susan, Bruce, Sylvia and Brad Davis. - How are you?
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
you have to have at least one drink with us.
well, we just got ourselves a booth, so, why don't we all squeeze in?
good.
you sure it's okay?
paul: Damn liberals would rather give handouts to drunken welfare mothers than pay for a war to kick the commies' ass.
Nam's a war we could have won. That's a fact.
I'm not so sure about that, Paul.
well, I guess we'll never know.
and watch out for this carter guy.
what you think the devil's gonna look like?
horns and fire?
more corn? Martha?
corn gives my wife gas.
you're excused, Ricky.
finally.
I'll go get the pie.
no, I'll get it. I'm... excuse me. I'm gonna...Get the pie.
man, is that guy a douche.
how'd you like to make five bucks?
all female cast?
is there any nudity in this?
could you please try not to completely humiliate me?
Oh, Laurie, glad you made it. You're just in time.
Hey, man, is this your play?
no.
this is Mr. Stephens. He teaches the class.
Oh, cool. I'm Logan.
curtain's about to go up, so, come on.
we'll have a party. Just you and me.
I'll wear something nice. Hurry up.
okay. Bye-bye.
who's there?
you. What do you want?
I'm sorry.
well, I don't suppose you two play bridge?
mom?
what is going on in here?
I'm sorry, mom. It-it just slipped out of my hands.
boys his age are always getting into some kind of trouble.
cut's pretty deep. We're gonna have to get him to the emergency room.
let me see.
Oh, my God! What the... Let me get the first aid kit.
sorry, folks. We're gonna have to call it a night.
Yeah. Come on, Martha, let's get out of the way.
thanks for the eats, Jan.
it's Janet.
relax, mom. It's just a gag.
ketchup.
it was dad's idea.
well, then... I guess the joke's on me.
thank you. - Of course.
I can't believe the outfits they make these girls wear.
it must be so humiliating.
actually, there's power in it.
that bunny tail put me through law school.
you were a bunny? - You're a lawyer?
Yes, and yes.
Sylvia's a partner at Kessler and Loeb.
Sylvia: I but worked here from '68 till '72.
organized the girls into a union before I left.
now they are fully insured, with benefits.
I still have the costume at home.
indeed she does.
and what do you do, Brad?
very little compared to my wife.
Brad's a psychologist.
he's written three books on human sexuality.
and how about you, Susan?
just a homemaker...and a mother.
culturally speaking, raising a family is the most significant job there is.
could you be more condescending?
I meant it as a compliment.
how-how many women work at your firm, Sylvia?
not nearly enough. Why?
are you thinking about taking the bar any time soon?
Oh, I think the time for law school has passed me by.
says who?
today's woman can do anything she puts her mind to.
how about a toast?
to the women in our lives.
and to new friends.
Cheers.
I love this song.
to Susie? - Go on.
shall we, gentleman?
whoever's out there, I have a gun, and I know how to use it.
it's Beej.
that's just a toy.
what are you doing here?
I brought you some dinner.
tuna and noodles.
you're letting all the bugs in.
in or out?
let me see. Let me see.
what was I saying? We could go on from there.
what were you saying when?
at the very beginning.
at the very beginning of what?
what the hell are they talking about?
this evening... I was saying...
I was saying...
babe, just say it already.
I got to get out of here.
then go. - Fine. you coming?
actress: What do we do now that we're happy?
we go on waiting. Waiting.
let me think. It's coming.
go on waiting.
now that we're happy.
let me see. Ah, the tree!
the tree?
look at it.
do you not remember?
I saw your mom today.
she was fighting with some guy.
that's Stu.
and they're always fighting.
but he's not your dad.
no. My dad went to Vietnam when I was five and never came back.
at least not to us.
how'd you get his wedding ring?
just came one year in a christmas card.
it's a walkie-talkie.
the other one's at my house, in case you need anything.
Thanks.
uh, but I-I don't think the signal would reach.
you can't stay out here forever, you know.
I-I'm sure my mom has the cops looking everywhere for me by now.
actually, I don't even think she knows you're missing.
I'm pretty sure Rick and I are the only ones who know you're here.
you need to go.
come back with me-- if things get bad, you can stay in my room as long as you want.
look, I can take care of myself.
let me help you. - Just go.
what?
you and me, here? Dancing, surrounded by all these people.
doesn't seem that weird, does it?
no, it doesn't.
do you have any idea how much I love you?
tell me.
you just keep surprising me.
that's a good thing, right?
and it's only gonna get better.
it's incredible.
what? - You and Tom.
that it actually works.
you're really not jealous?
Oh, it's only sex. It's not what really matters.
Bruce and I made a pact.
not to do it again.
Oh, good.
you should both decide for yourselves what works and what doesn't, just as long as you're on the same page, and believe me, Tom and I have a few pacts of our own.
me, too.
what happened to Brad and Sylvia?
Oh, you just missed them. Sylvia has court in the morning.
Oh, that's too bad.
we've all been invited to a penthouse at the Hancock for a little after party.
