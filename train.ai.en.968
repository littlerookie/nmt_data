last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.
so, I mean...
Bella is back.
Yeah, I guess so. - Huh, that's... Welcome.
so listen, not now that... You know, you're talking and...eating again, you know?
you gotta get that protein in there.
I was just wondering, if you wanted to go see a movie with me.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, I do.
cool, um, let me see...
we could check out "Love spelled backwards is love.
Yeah, it's a dumb title, but, um, it's a romantic comedy.
I mean, it's supposed to be. - No. No romance.
how about "Face Punch"? You heard of that?
well, it's an action movie. - Yeah, it's perfect.
with guns... adrenaline...
it's my thing - Okay.
we should get a bunch of people to go. Do you guys wanna go see...
face Punch? - "Face Punch"? Yeah!
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that?
remember the trailer's like... - Yeah?
punch his face in. - I don't remember that.
movie night with Bella!
so, "Face Punch," huh? You like action movies?
not really.
I heard it sucks. Bad.
Hey, are you even old enough to see this movie?
I mean, you know, without adult supervision? - Right, yeah.
well, she's buying my ticket for me. - She's buying it, okay.
Jessica bailed and Angela's got the stomach flu so Eric's taking care of her.
so, it's just us three. - Great.
great. - Yeah.
put the gun down.
put your gun down or I'm gonna blow your freaking head off.
both of you!
put both of your guns down or I'm gonna blow both of your freaking heads off.
alright, let's do this!
okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!
Jesus! - What a marshmallow!
you should hold out for someone with a stronger stomach.
someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.

someone who laughs at the gore that makes weaker men vomit.
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.
I feel bad. He probably has that flu that's...
going around.
what? I can't hold your hand? - No, of course, you can.
I just think it means something really different to you.
so...
okay, tell me something. You like me, right?
and you think, I'm sorta beautiful?
Jake, please... don't do this.
Why?
because you are about to ruin everything.
and I need you.
well, I've got loads of time.
I'm not gonna give up.
I don't want you to.
but...
it's just because I don't want you to go anywhere.
it's... it's really selfish.
you know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up.
I'm never gonna run right.
so I should be fair to you.
it's because of him, right?
look, I know what he did to you.
but, Bella, I would never, ever do that.
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.
I won't let you down.
you can count on me.
well...
I need to go home.
I'm... I was feeling sick before the movie, okay?
what is your problem? - Right now?
you are my problem.
feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.
do you want me to put you in the hospital?
Jake... Jake, the movie's over. What are you doing?
Jake, you're really hot.
like, you feel like you have a fever. Are you okay?
I don't know what's happening.
I gotta go.
that dude is weird.
Jake.
uh, your Dad says you have mono.
he won't let me visit but... would you call me?
Hey, uh, it's me again. I just...
I'm sorry about what I said at the movie theatre.
I just wanted to hear your voice. So, no pressure.
jacob, please call me.
okay, we should be back around three.
Hey!
look, I don't have to go fishing today. - Yes, you do.
Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about?
just be careful. - I always am.
those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella.
my kung foo is strong.
Jake!
you cut your hair?
and got a tattoo?
Bella...
I thought you were too sick to come outside.
or pick up the phone when I'd call.
go away. - What?
go away.
what happened to you? What's wrong?
Hey, what happened?
did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening?
Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.
but if you want somebody to blame,
how about those filthy bloodsuckers, you love?
the Cullens.
I don't know what are you talking about.
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
you've been lying to everyone. Charlie...
but you can't lie to me.
not anymore, Bella. - Come on! Jacob!
look, Bella...
we can't be friends anymore.
Jake, I know that I have been...
...hurting you.
it's... it's killing me. It kills me.
if you, may be, give me like some time or something.
don't!
it's not you.
it's not you, it's me, right? Really?
it's true! It is me.
I'm not good.
I used to be... a good kid.
not anymore.
it doesn't even matter, alright? This is over.
you can't break up with me.
I mean...
I mean, you're my best friend.
you promised me.
I know.
I promised that I won't hurt you, Bella.
and this is me keeping that promise.
go home.
and don't come back. Or you're gonna get hurt.
things are...
things are bad again.
without Jake, I just... I can't stand it.
I don't see Edward anymore.
now it really feels like he never existed.
I will find a place where I can see him again.
I didn't expect to find you here.
I went to visit the Cullens, but... the house is empty.
I'm surprised they left you behind.
weren't you sort of a, um, ...a pet of theirs?
Yeah. You could say that.
do they Cullens visit often?
lie.
Yeah, absolutely, all the time. - Lie better.
I'll tell them that you stopped by.
I probably shouldn't tell to Edward.
because he's pretty protective. - But he's far away, isn't he?
why are you here?
I came as a favor to Victoria.
she asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens.
victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate given he killed hers.
an eye for an eye.
threaten him. - Edward would know who did it!
and he'd come after you.
I don't think he will.
after all, how much could you mean to him...
...if he left you here unprotected?
victoria won't be happy about me killing you.
but I can't help myself.
you're so mouthwatering. - Please, don't!
I mean, you'd helped us. - Shhhh!
don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness.
victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, ...where as I'll make it quick. I promise.
you will feel nothing.
Edward, I love you.
I don't believe it.
dad, I saw them!
what's the matter? - In the woods. They are not bears!
what you mean in the woods?
Bella, what the hell were you doing out in the woods?
they are wolves. I mean, they're like huge wolves!
are you sure about that, Bella? - Yeah, I just saw them.
they were after... something.
wolves? You saw?
alright. Well, Harry, ...feel like going hunting?
can you get some of your guys together?
sure, yeah. I'll... I'll just...
I know that those wolves will be dead.
and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected.
Victoria.
I should go to the station.
dad, you should... You should go.
you can just stay in the house?
Oh, you scared me.
what the hell are you doing? - Back up. I'm coming up.
look, look, I'm sorry.
for what? - I wish I could explain, ...but I literally... can't!
have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone?
one that wasn't yours to share.
well, that's what it's like for me.
or worse.
you have no idea, how tight I'm bounded.
I hate this.
I hate what they have done to you.
I mean, the killer part is you already know!
Bella, do you remember, when walked on the beach in La Push?
the story...
the story... The story about the cold ones.
I guees, I understand why that's the only part you remember.
there must gotta be something you can do...
no. I'm in it for life.
may be we should just get out of here for a while.
we'll just leave. Just you and me.
you can do that?
I'll do it for you.
it's not something I can just run away from, Bella.
but I would run away with you.
if I could.
I gotta go. They'll certainly wonder where I am.
come here.
please... Try to remember.
it would be so much easier if you knew...
I tried, but... Jake.
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.
Edward, I'm scared.
you should be.
really it's just like an old story...
that we're not supposed to say anything about...
did you know, the Quileute are supposed to be descendants from wolves?
I need to see him.
he's not in.
I'm sorry, really need to see him. - Bella?
what did you do?
okay, what did you do? - Hey!
what did you do to him? - Easy!
he didn't want this! - But we do.
what did he do? What did he tell you? - Both of you calm...
nothing! He told me nothing, because he's scared of you!
too late, now. - Bella, get back.
Paul, calm down now.
run!
Jake, run!
the cooler was off for ten hours.
exactly enough time to reduce Amanda McNeal to a putrefied mass.
our only link to the kidnapper, obliterated.
so, how we doing on the swatch of fabric that Marcy brought in?
trace came back, material's most likely from a cotton blend pullover.
now, we already know that blood on one side came from Mark Valera.
well, someone with blood on his shirt should be sweating.
right, which is why I checked the other side for perspiration.
we got a DNA match from CODIS.
Marcy Collins's boyfriend: Benjamin Wilson, in the system for possession with intent in '02.
issue a BOLO. - Done.
the senator's ex, Jessica Nivens has been apprehended, they're bringing her in.
you had Max followed, didn't you?
we needed to find you.
so, you took advantage of my son's trusting nature.
and you're all right with that, Agent Kelton?
well, I watch the news.
I understand I'm a person of interest.
so, tell me, are you interested?
why doesn't the FBI believe you?
I called five times, no one's followed up.
well, they're busy. Senator just put out a two million dollar reward.
they're dealing with a lot of cranks.
hey- hey, I'm not a crank.
and you don't want a couple million dollars?
I want to find her.
listen, I watch you. This is your story.
all those other news channels are just trying to catch up.
have a look.
you can reach me at that number.
I'm not crazy.
and her name's not Sara.
members of the Judiciary Committee are attempting to carry on with the questioning of Judge Rainer, despite the absence of their colleague, Jeffrey Collins.
the Georgia senator remains secluded in his Atlanta home,
they want me back in Washington.
you need to get some sleep.
I can't turn off any lights.
I want to believe she could walk in that door any minute.
I don't want her coming home to a dark house.
5000000.0
hundred $ BILLS NOON TOMORROW
you have to tell the FBI.
I haven't unlocked that drawer for a week.
this was planted by someone;
someone inside this house. Someone who could be watching us now!
Jeff, there are three Bureau agents in the house at all times.
right.
and they missed this.
it's our wedding photo.
I got to get five million dollars by noon tomorrow.
that's impossible.
there's got to be a way.
well, there isn't.
unless...
what?
your accounts are being monitored.
you'll set off alarms if you so much as touch them.
Jeff, if you're serious about this, if you really want to do this without the FBI...
then it's got to be through me.
it was the first time we'd met.
the afternoon of her disappearance?
Yeah, I called Sara that morning and asked her to meet me at the cafe and told her to please not tell Jeffrey.
Why?
truth is I needed her help.
I wanted her to talk to my husband, ex-husband-- on my behalf.
what did you want her to say to him?
that if she cared about Marcy and Max, as I'm sure she does, to please ask Jeffrey to allow me back into their lives.
I told her I was returning to Atlanta and...
I wanted to be able to love my children.
what did she say?
she said that she'd do her best.
she seemed very sweet.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure what this is.
well, those are Sara's hairs.
they were found in your hotel room, pulled out by the roots.
I asked Sara to meet me again that evening, at the Biltmore,
the same hotel where they were holding her party.
she came to my room.
she told me that she hadn't spoken with Jeffrey.
she hadn't been able to find the time.
I'm afraid I became upset.
she turned to go, and I reached out to grab her.
I think a few of her hairs may have gotten caught in my ring.
I'm not sure.
and that was the last time I saw her.
so, if we're done looking at pictures...
a few more.
this is Mark Valera.
he lured Sara Collins out of the ballroom and tied her up in his car.
he was found dead in that same car, with a bullet wound to his head, five hours later.
this is Amanda McNeal, wife of the ex-mayor.
her body was recovered 18 hours after Valera's.
except she'd been dead for ten years.
this is the former mayor, Curtis McNeal, who killed himself minutes after identifying his wife.
you can't be suggesting I'm in any way responsible?
well, I'm suggesting that you're not telling me everything.
perhaps you started something, Ms. Nevins.
you couldn't have known how it was going to end up.
perhaps it was Sara who started something, Agent Kelton.
have you thought about that?
local police found Marcy Collins' car abandoned in the woods in the Chattahoochee preserve.
we're not able to reach her, I'm going to the senator's house.
I'm going with you.
ms. Nevins, you're free to go, but I am going to ask you not to leave town.
I have no intention of going anywhere.
it's a copy;
the original is still on file at the County Pediatric Hospital in Orlando.
your daughter should be what now...
eleven?
Yes, Jessica, I had a child.
did you really think that I was afraid to tell Jeff?
well, you haven't.
what do you want? Hmm?
for you to disappear.
what else are you hiding?
why haven't you found Marcy?
actually, that's why we're here.
the evidence against her boyfriend-- Ben Wilson.
blood on his shirt-- now puts him at the scene of Mark Valera's shooting.
we have agents out looking for him.
you think Marcy's in danger? That's one possibility.
senator, it's three days now.
we have leads, but still no communication with whoever took your wife.
we know she had a falling-out with Marcy, but we need to know if that could be relevant.
it's not.
we're wondering if you can help us contact her.
she doesn't return my calls.
we're done here.
I think you heard the senator. That's enough.
if Marcy's in danger, find her.
Jeffrey, it's a possibility.
what, that Marcy could've have planted that phone? No.
you need to get me that money.
put a tail on J. T. - Done.
what, Max?
is Ben with you?
Yeah. Why? - Marcy, he's a suspect.
Max, you've got to trust me-- he didn't do anything.
come home.
if he's innocent, tell the FBI-- help them.
I can handle it myself.
we're going to wait till this all blows over.
Marce, they th... they think he killed a guy.
do you believe me or them?
who was that?
the FBI's looking for you.
Ben, maybe we should go home.
I can talk to my dad.
you can talk to him.
you think they'd believe me?
I shouldn't have brought you into this. - That's not what I meant.
you can still get out, Marcy.
no, Ben. No.
I know a place we can go, keep out of sight till we figure things out.
I don't want to leave you.
what do you got?
per your order, we put J. T. Morse, the senator's chief of staff, under surveillance.
he left the Collins estate 25 minutes ago.
five minutes ago, he met with this woman at a parking garage in Buckhead.
no words were exchanged, but he walked away holding that.
well, nothing says suspicious like a deserted garage and a briefcase drop.
you I. D. the woman? - Got the license number.
running it through the DMV database as we speak.
Yeah, it's the big day.
Peter Francis Manning turns 21 today.
what are we even looking at?
happy Birthday. Here you go, your first beer.
Nicky, come here. Nicky, come here.
a little service, please, Nicky.
freeze it.
resolution's not great.
do what you can.
sure looks like Sara.
does the tape have a date stamp?
may fifth,'94.
12 years ago.
same time Sara goes missing from Florida.
any problems?
told the agent at the door they were files-- security briefings.
agent Kelton.
senator, I'm going to have to ask you to open that.
these are classified documents.
sir, we followed Mr. Morse to a rendezvous with a Ms. Annabeth Townsend.
traced her name from the license on her vehicle.
you had me tailed?!
turns out Ms. Townsend is the personal secretary for Lance Dunbar, the founder and majority stockholder of Dunbar-Kittridge Commercial Real Estate.
I know who he is.
according to your file, he's a friend.
and one of your biggest campaign contributors.
sir, it's true that I cannot legally compel you to open that.
still, we are very curious about a certain five million that was just liquidated from Mr. Dunbar's accounts.
so, either that's an illegal campaign contribution...
they said they'd kill her if I went to you.
what else did they say?
you're in hell now.
I get that, but you have got to trust us.
it's your only hope of finding out who did this and getting Sara back alive.
we've been monitoring all incoming communications. How did they get to you?
there they are. Or should I say, there she is.
12 years ago, one month ago.
I told you.
I'm really glad you came to me, Peter. I just have a couple of questions.
shoot.
why did she leave you?
I don't know.
did she ever ask you for money?
What?!
no... I don't like where this is going.
I'm just trying to figure out why Sara changed her name for four months, moved to Gloucester and then took off.
no, no, no, no, no-- See, you don't get it.
she is Nicky.
Sara-- she's not real.
I want my tape back. - Peter...
no, no, this is your what, your spin?
that Nicky was a fraud and I was conned?
I just want the full story. - I just want my tape back.
here you go.
sorry I wasted your time.
we got a copy, right?
digitized and stored. I'll format it for broadcast.
not yet.
what?
we're going to hold on to it.
don't tell me Pete got to you.
baby. - What then?
every story's got a beginning, middle and end.
that tape is the beginning.
as soon as I air it, every other reporter's on equal footing.
I want the whole story, not just the beginning.
we've dusted it, ear and mouthpiece swabbed;
keypad's too small to retain much detail.
only prints we found are the senator's.
what about the SIM chip inside?
phone numbers dialed, address book data?
it's brand-new, never used, except to receive the text and video message and that they could have sent from anywhere.
our best shot is to get a position of the cell phone tower when they call again.
are you set up for that?
we'll find out at noon.
forensics just got back from Ben Wilson's house.
found something interesting in a guitar case.
a 1911 Colt.
the gun used to kill Valera.
ballistics check out.
shoots nine millimeter parabellum.
the only one of its kind in the state.
okay, it's time to go wide.
let's call a press conference, alert the public:
Ben Wilson wanted for murder.
whose place is this?
a friend of mine.
name's Quinn.
helped me get clean.
Quinn's always been there for me. Even back when nobody else was.
damn, code's changed.
we should get back to the car.
Hey, Ben, how's it going?
you must be...
standing by. Ready to tap and trace.
it's noon.
what if our times and theirs don't match?
wait.
it's the fax.
change coordinates.
you have half an hour.
Rita's Soup and Salad, "Cascadia Plaza."
sit next to the black jacket.
come alone.
there's no time.
that's the idea, Senator.
whoever's doing this-- they want to keep us off balance, not give us enough time to react.
so they know I brought you in on it.
we have to assume.
well, then Sara may already be dead.
look, let's just make sure they don't kill you.
put it on him.
listen, covert tac team's en route.
downtown, lunch hour, should be plenty of cover.
well, they better make it snappy-- we got 25 minutes.
we traced the fax to a retail copy place. Called the clerk.
the original is still in the machine.
could he I. D. who sent it?
no. It was time-delayed.
we're checking with the store's security cams.
they fax him inis own house while they know we have him surrounded by agents.
you think they know we know?
I'm positive.
get him a vest.
stowed the car.
around the corner.
you two making friends?
Quinn was just telling me how you two met.
Yes.
I was auditioning guitar players, and in comes this skinny kid.
way too skinny.
but, uh... he had something going on.
she tell you how she likes to take in strays?
what do you always say?
uh-uh, it's too early in the day.
to every sojourner, "on whatever path, " help and refuge at the speaking of the word.
Yeah, so we're like family.
you can stay here as long as you like.
Ben, you got a moment?
sure.
I'm in place.
in place.
I don't like it.
it's a busy public place, lot of pedestrians.
so?
so it's where we'd want a ransom drop.
there's plenty of cover for the TAC team.
there's no easy escape route.
why'd they pick it?
the public's asked to be on the lookout for Ben Wilson, wanted for questioning in the murder of Mark Valera.
the gun used to shoot Valera was found in Wilson's home earlier today.
Wilson's been linked with Senator Collins' daughter Marcy.
he was briefly detained by the FBI on the night of the kidnapping as a possible suspect in the case, but was later released.
the 23-year-old musician and club promoter...
911. State your emergency.
911. Please state...
this is Marcy Collins.
I know you're looking for Ben Wilson.
he's with me.
what's wrong?
I needed to get some fresh air.
who were you talking to?
I was trying to call Max.
this is about Quinn, isn't it?
come on, Ben, look at her.
let's get out here you're my girl, Marcy.
he's here.
audio, how's our signal?
I can hear his every breath.
check it out.
world headquarters, broadcasting 24/7.
journal Constitution offices are there, middle ten floors.
channel 2 News.
media central. Think it means anything?
we'll know soon enough.
can you guys hear that?
it's coming from the jacket.
and so it starts.
don't say anything. Just listen.
all right, they're talking to him. How do we tap and trace?
can't. Not unless we grab the phone.
take off the hat.
take off the glasses.
pick up the money.
first, he undergoes the trial by water.
approach the water.
step in, Senator.
go to the steps.
what's he doing?
what do we do? - Just wait.
go up the steps.
keep going.

FBI crime scene!
go up the steps.
everybody back up! Back up!
back up! Back up! Back away! Back away!
go through the door.

where is he? - Connection's being jammed.
we lost him at the door, bottom of the steps.
we lost him.
and so has he passed the trial by fire.
well done, Senator.
keep walking.
stop. Turn right.
down the stairs.
go through.
we're in!
all right, I'm headed to the lobby of Cascadia One.
I need you to patch me back into the senator now.
I need that patch up!
almost there.
go through the door.
left.
left.
stop. Get into the elevator.
throw the phone away.
throw the phone away.
get that open!
how do we stop it?
it's express.
there's no access before the roof.
welcome to Cascadia Tower rising 1, 800 feet above sea level.
once at the top, you'll enjoy an exciting view, day or night, of Atlanta,
and now comes the trial of silence.
have you been silent, Senator?
you know who we are.
we've met before.
confirm the ninth.
what do you mean?!
confirm the ninth and she lives.
but... how do I know she's alive?
for then comes the trial by blood.
stand back! Stand back.
sir...
we have medical personnel standing by.
I'm fine.
senator... - I need to go home.
what happened in there?
it went up, it dropped.
sir, Senator, stop!
I don't take orders from you!
Ben, please pull over.
Marce, listen to me, listen to me. You need to get out first.
no, Ben. Tell them that I forced you, that I made you come with me.
Ben, I know what you did.
I'm sorry.
sorry? Sorry for what?
you okay? ms.
he's not armed. Please don't hurt him.
sir, step out of the car! Put your hands up!
turn around, walk backwards!
stay back here.
what are you going to do to him?
he's going to be fine, ma'am. - Put your hands on the hood.
hold on.
that money, someone put it in his car.
I had that money in my hands. The guy took it from me.
ma'am, we still got to bring him in.
the guy must have put the money in his car! He's being set up!
Ben! No! Ben!
stop! He's being set up!
you said you made a copy of the Nicky Johnson tape.
I can't find the file.
the whole hard drive's corrupted.
she's gone.
the director was sitting with the AG in Washington, watching it live.
the media, the national media is on a feeding frenzy.
is that a concern?
the manhole was set for remote detonation with a charge of C-4 containing RDX.
it's restricted military ordnance.
all U. S. stock is serialized, recorded.
any bases report theft? - We're finding out.
how'd they override the elevators?
the system is computerized.
possibly a hack from a remote location.
we're still trying to trace it.
this could not have gone any worse.
Oh, I don't know.
it's the Miller case.
Nathan Miller all over again.
be prepared because that's what they're gonna say.
another failed ransom drop!
this was never about the money.
this was set in motion to drive a wedge between the senator and us to prove to him that he can get past us and our security and that he can't trust us.
and it worked; he's not talking.
she's still alive.
and you know this because...?
the way he looked at me when he stepped off that elevator.
they made Jeffrey Collins jump through hoops to put him in a place where we couldn't reach him.
for what?
to communicate something to him and to him alone.
they isolated him in an elevator to give him a message?
I'm sure of it.
gotcha.
they just apprehended Ben Wilson.
Marcy Collins was with him.
a dangerous prank, domestic terrorism or a payoff gone wrong?
authorities won't say which, as just hours ago, witnesses saw Senator Jeffrey Collins open a suitcase full of hundred dollar bills at Cascadia Plaza in downtown Atlanta, then watched it explode in what some onlookers describe as a literal fountain of cash.
moments later, while the crowd and police were distracted down below, our WCN camera captured this exclusive footage:
senator Collins trapped in an elevator plunging almost 30 stories before landing safely at the lobby floor below.
according to FBI Public Information Office,
Ben Wilson has been taken into custody in connection with Mark Valera's homicide.
Wilson has been romantically linked to Marcy Collins, senator Collins' daughter with his first wife, Jessica Nevins.
there's been no further word from the Collins camp.
the senator has secluded himself, speaking only to his family and staff.
I remember this song from the wedding.
Sara loved the melody.
it's Bach's "Little Fugue."
dad, I've been watching the news. What they put your through...
everything's okay.
Yeah, but all that money, and the elevator... What was going on out there?
you just need to know I'm doing everything I can to get Sara back.
go ahead.
hello.
um, can I ask who's calling?
uh, Dad?
Yeah.
it's for you.
who is it?
Hello?
Hello, Jeffrey.
who is it?
on the elevator, you asked for proof of life.
that's right.
you were a corduroy jacket today.
Sara says she bought it for you last Christmas.
let me talk to her.
let's talk about Second Samuel 12: 7.
what? - Dad?
second Samuel 12: 7
and the prophet Nathan said to King David, 'Thou art the man.'
I don't understand.
what are you saying?!
king David thought he could hide from God, but God sees everything, and so do we.
What...?
Mrs Collins, you have a call from the household It's urgent
in a blink of an eye, the wife of an US senator vanished.
but her disapperance is only the beginning of a mystery
this is Mark Valera. He lured Sara Collins out of the ballroom and tied her up in his car
he's found dead at the same car with a bullet in his head 5 hours later
he was killed, and then inked
now, as the FBI closes in A family's secrets are exposed
Marcy Collins, the senator's daughter by a prior marriage, was also missing
she was at the home of her boyfriend Ben Wilson
forensics just got back found something interesting in a guitar case
the gun used to kill Valera Aware the public, Ben Wilson, wanted for murder
Ben! He's been set up!
senator Collins' ex-wife Jessica Nevins is being sought as a person of interest
they've never met before - Hi, mom - Why is the FBI looking for you?
those are Sara's hairs. They were found in your hotel room pulled out by the roots.
you want an exclusive? Sara Collins isn't whom she says she is
4 days ago
you're late.
sorry.
this place wasn't exactly easy to find.
is that it?
I'm telling you, that's what happened.
it's a complicated story.
you really should have rehearsed it
it's not a story. - Come on, Ben!
we know you were the shooter.
we found the gun you used to kill him in your house.
you better talk to me.
all right, moving on. Your bluetooth earpiece.
what?
Yeah, we found that, too, in the tunnel.
same place we found Sara Collin's blood.
wait. I don't...
you think I had something to do with sara?
excuse the interruption. You're questioning my client without his attorney present?
well, he waived his right.
he's changed his mind.
it's not up to you. Mr. Wilson?
Yeah, I want to see my lawyer.
we'd like the room.
brent Sullivan, court appointed.
according to the report, you're in a hell of a mess.
Mr. Sullivan, I didn't do what they're saying.
I don't own a gun. I was never in that tunnel.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think
you think you're being set up.
Yeah.
someone have it out for you?
I was delivering the money for a friend of mine--Quinn Keeler.
she might know what's going on.
give me a number.
all right, I'll look into quinn and I will be back in the morning.
wait.
I need to talk to Marcy. my girlfriend
what?
Marcy Collins turned you in.
if you're looking for reading material there's an enquirer in the men's room.
most agents display their commendations.
just not every day I get my name in the paper.
I caught your coverage last night.
senator collins ummeting in the elevator
it's a compelling piece.
well, 20 million viewers agree with you.
that five-second clip got us the highest rating since O. J.
Congratulations.
your cameras did have a pretty good angle.
did you get video of the elevator before it dropped?
that's why you called me.
you want my raw footage.
is that going to be a problem?
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
come on, kelton, you got to give me something for it.
I tell you what...
...you just give me the footage,
I won't issue a court order to seize it.
I wouldn't want you to go through all that paperwork anyway.
just take note of my goodwill.
nice chatting with you.
we need to talk.
what are you doing here?
I'm her mother. Why wouldn't I?
why, the FBI call you?
I did, dad.
Hey, you okay?
you need to help Ben.
it's my fault he got arrested.
what do you mean,"fault"?
Marcy, they're saying he killed someone.
he may have had something to do with Sara's kidnapping.
no, dad, someone is setting him up.
the police found a bag of money in his car. It was planted.
Marcy... stop.
you need to come home. Just let the...
you're not listening to me!
you should tell your father.
it's okay.
what?
what?
dad...
Ben and I were...
I'm pregnant.
take a look at this.
what are we looking at?
wait a sec-- let me freeze and magnify.
he's on the emergency phone.
right. Now, those lines go straight to building security.
I checked the phone logs. There's no record of the call. I mean, nothing.
look at his eye line.
it's the video screen.
hmm, I've been on that elevator.
it's a loop. Scenic Atlanta, things to do in the big peach.
so what's he seeing that we don't?
among those deeply affected by this tragedy are the young students of Mrs. Collins'second-grade class.
if you could say anything to Mrs. Collins, what would you want to tell her?
you're my favorite teacher.
I miss you and I hope you come back soon.
a simple statement, but one that I imagine echoes the thoughts of the many that are gathered here today.
senator?
do you have a minute?
excuse me.
do you remember when you bought this painting?
I'd just given birth to Max.
you thought it would look perfect in his bedroom.
but he cried every time he looked at it.
why are you here, Jessica?
I'm worried about Marcy. - So am I.
but she's not ready to talk.
she needs space.
I'm sure you know here better than I do, and I'm the last person you want parenting advice from.
but marcy doesn't need space.
she needs us. - Us?
I know I haven't been around.
and it's complicated between you and me, but right now, the kids come first.
the kids have always come first.
Marcy's pregnant, Max has to lie about seeing me, and you have a media circus camped outside your house.
the kids are under tremendous stress, Jeffrey.
Jessica, why are you really here?
pardon me?
it's been five years.
why now with everything going on?
I know what you must be going through.
you have no idea.
senator, could I have a word please?
I was only on that elevator for two minutes, Agent Kelton.
who were you talking to on the emergency phone?
and now comes the trial of silence.
you know who we are.
we've met before.
the elevator was stuck.
I was calling for help.
we checked the phone logs, security desk never heard from you.
why would I lie to you about this?
tell no one.
further instructions will follow.
I think you're scared.
I think... the kidnappers contacted you on that elevator.
they gave you the real demand.
confirm the ninth...
...and she lives.
why are you interrogating me instead of looking for sara?
why are you shutting me out when the only thing I'm trying to dois help you find your wife?
come in.
Hey, how you holding up?
fine.
how about you?
uh... there's something I need to ask you.
the night Sara disappeared, the FBI found a home pregnancy test in our bathroom.
it was mine.
Nina was cleaning out my bathroom.
I was in a rush to find out.
you thought it was Sara's?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Hey, come here.
anything you need. I'm here, okay?
if you were here for me, dad, you'd be helping ben.
it goes against my better judgment, but I pulled a few strings.
you can see Ben. Just for a few minutes.
dad. Thanks, dad.
Hey, Agent Kelton said they found some pretty convincing evidence against him.
is it possible Ben did something because he knew you and Sara weren't getting along?
no, dad, he didn't do anything.
I never even told him about that.
you and Sara used to be so close.
I mean, the two women I love most in this world, and you haven't been on speaking terms for almost a year.
I want to know why.
I'm sorry.
yeah?
are you all right?
sure. Why?
well, the party started almost an hour ago.
I thought maybe you'd...
Marcy, you look beautiful.
is that a new dress?
sort of.
huh.
what? - Who is he?
he's downstairs, isn't he?
tell me. - Not yet.
and I don't want dad to know.
Why? - I don't know.
he might not be his first choice.
Oh, Marcy, give your father a little bit more credit.
okay, fine, and not that you asked, but, um...
I think the red.
hurry.
I'm confused.
I thought you couldn't determine the cause of death.
the rapid decomp of amanda mcneal's body didn't leave much, but I was able to work up tissue from what was left of her lungs.
the presence of diatoms indicate that she was breathing when she hit the water.
so drowning is the official C. O.D.
but she was only under for a few hours.
none of the signs associated with a floater.
also found traces of red clay and silt in her lungs and sinuses.
huh. Consistent with drowning in a natural body of water.
you know, diatoms are unique to every body of water. Maybe we could find a match.
sure. If we sample every puddle in the state.
great. Dead body, dead end.
where are you going? - The church. Pray for a lead.
daddy! - Hey, squirt.
Hey, how was your class?
father Moyer says I can make my first confession this weekend.
Really?
you must have a lot to get off your chest, huh?
well, we got to go.
we do not want to keep mama waiting.
I want to light a candle for grandma first.
okay. I think she'd like that.
Oh, she's ready for sunday.
uh, to be honest, she was ready before the communion class.
Yeah, she takes after her mother.
so, you and Ava both coming?
Yeah. - Hmm.
don't worry, you can seat us apart.
Inez?! - What is it!?
daddy!
what's wrong?
come here.
you put this next to the candle you lit for grandma?
Uh-huh.
where did you get it?
a man gave it to me. He said it was good luck.
what did he look like?
I don't know. He looked... friendly.
daddy, I know I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, but it was church.
I know. It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.
I just want to know what the man looked like.
I don't remember.
what color was his hair?
what was he wearing?
he had plastic hands.
he had plastic hands?
he had... plastic hands like this?
Yeah. Can I try?
inez, No, no. No! Listen to me.
I want you to close your eyes.
I want you to try and see the man.
now, was he young like me, or was he old like Uncle Joe?
I... I'm not sure. - Well, try and think!
what are you doing?
I'm sorry. I just, uh... straight home, I know.
it would have been nice if you called.
I got caught up in something here.
come on, honey.
sorry. - It's okay.
I never liked that tie.
you bought it for me.
I got it on sale.
Bye, daddy. - Bye, baby.
I'll see you sunday, okay? - Okay.
five minutes - thanks
Hey.
Ben, I...
I'm in here because of you.
I messed up.
I'm sorry.
you say you want to make a life together...
I do...
you called the cops on me.
you honestly think that I could kill someone?
that i had something to do with all of this?
what was I supposed to think?
the gun, the blood...
I don't know what's going on anymore.
Yeah, well, join the club.
well, if ben is involved, marcy's in the dark.
I'm sure senator collins will be pleased to hear that.
I'll place the call.
and next time, give me a heads up.
my dad will find a way to get you out of here.
no. You get out. - Ben...
I don't want to see you again.
Ben, please... - I said get out!
champagne?
I'm 17.
don't ask, don't tell.
stupid policy if you ask me.
Marcy? How's my girl?
Hi, dad. - Hi.
Marcy, a pleasure as always.
Hi, Judge Rainer.
Marcy, you remember Judge Rainer's son, cd.
he's an english lit major at yale now.
Hey. It's good to see you again.
Hi.
uh, marcy's a huge shakespeare fan.
Oh, that's great.
I am? - Aren't you?
school play. You were ophelia.
I was 11.
Oh, that's right.
if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have to steal these two.
the photographer is ready.
of course, of course.
thank you. - Excuse us.
duty calls. - See you.
we'll talk later.
enjoy the party. - Thank you.
Kelton! I tracked down saint nathan's address: 1239 robinia.
only it no longer exists.
how does an address disappear?
it gets buried under 800 million gallons of water.
acacia city reservoir.
red clay.
large body of water.
Yep, looks like we found our puddle.
well, I wish we could take credit.
but we're only here because somebody wants us to be.
keep your hand near your holster.
can I help you folks?
I sure hope so.
how controlled is the access to the reservoir?
well, public's restricted.
security's tightened up pretty good over the last couple of years.
do you have any idea how the security was ten years ago?
it didn't exist.
coincides with amanda mcneal's disappearance.
any unusual activity in the past few weeks?
well, it depends on what you consider to be unusual.
we talking skinny dippers or sasquatch unusual?
no, any break ins, security breaches?
property's monitored by passive infrared sensors.
high number of trips lately, but we just don't have the manpower to chase down every false alarm.
probably just deer. It's mating season and all.
incident reports. Help yourself.
check it out. I'm going to walk the perimeter.
Yeah.
where the hell you been? I've been calling you for hours.
babe, I'm in gloucester.
alone? What are you doing there?
fishing for a story. If Mel calls, cover for me will you?
wait...
Adam, I gotta call you back.
Hi. I was wondering if you could help me.
I was told that a woman named Nicky Johnson once worked here.
God... yeah, that's uh... years ago.
what can you tell me about her?
you a cop or something?
I'm not asking for her I-9.
just for your help.
she, uh, she only worked here a couple of months.
a bit of a wild one.
rubbed some of the regulars the wrong way.
Really?
to be honest, I was going to fire her, but one day she just up and left.
she's on our wall of shame if you want to take a look.
love to. - Hey.
that's all the employees and regulars since the day we opened.
could've sworn she was up here.
how long have these photos been missing?
I didn't know they were.
can you patch into the pir sensor grid for the acacia city reservoir?
Yeah, federal dhs should be networked in for access. Just give me a sec.
what are you doing out there?
field trip.
okay. What am I looking for?
any movement in the northwest quadrant.
got something along the shore next to the comm tower.
Yeah, that'd be me.
what else you got?
multiple hits, approximately 300 yards west of that, next to access road three.
Thanks.
do yourself a favor... don't.
take it easy.
let's not do anything crazy.
you okay?
you all right?
I've been better.
contact's up. Depth, 220.
come around 90 degrees. Bring in the gain.
so I'm thinking...
a gal saves a guy's life, he owes her a cappuccino.
three sugars, non-fat milk. - Of course.
whoever led you here
either they wanted you to uncover what was going on last night or...
or they wanted me dead.
you've been off the grid for over three hours.
you access secure dhs networks without my authorization, and now you got yourself a shoot team investigation;
whatever happened to giving me the heads up, huh?
uh, heads up...
we requisitioned a sonar boat.
what? Why?
perimeter sensors logged 12 times the amount of normal activity since the night sara disappeared.
we need to know what's down there.
so you think this is a body dump?
it's a possibility.
side-scan just got a hard return; shape of a body.
looks to be in rigor.
could be sara.
notify u-sert.
I want a camera boat in the water within the hour.
what's going on? Nobody's telling me anything.
arraignment's first thing tomorrow; you're going to be transferred to federal holding for the night.
did you reach Quinn?
forget about Quinn. I called the number. It's been disconnected.
Ben, it doesn't look good.
if you keep your mouth shut, maybe I can work a deal.
listen, I didn't do anything.
you need to talk to Quinn. She lives at 5412 euclid. Please find her.
all right. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah. - You're good to go.
I want to report a robbery in progress.
Yeah, the post office on dekalb.
empty the register now! Now!
Hey, whatever you say.
free, don't move
at today's hearings, judiciary committee Chairman Mazarra reiterated his support for supreme court nominee, Judge Wallace Rainer.
it's still unclear whether Senator Collins, considered to be the swing vote in Rainer's confirmation, will be able to attend those hearings, given his wife's recent disappearance.
sources indicate that pressure is mounting by the white house to have that vote with, or without, Senator Collins.
the vote is currently scheduled Rubia, he's here.
...as we've been reporting, the hearings thus far have been contentious, even for the...
thank you.
senator Collins...
I can't imagine what you must be going through.
if there's anything that the justice department can do to help...
give us a moment.
at sara's event, you and I had a chat.
senator, Robert Rubia.
what can I do for you, Mr. Rubia?
the supreme court... with the confirmation being three days away,
I was hoping, perhaps...
I'm sorry. What were you hoping?
that you publicly declare your intention to vote with the party for the president's pick.
I'll do what you want.
but first I need to know if she's still alive.
I'm sorry.
J. T. Indicated to me that you wanted to speak about the confirmation hearings.
that's what we're doing.
and you know exactly what I'm talking about.
now you'veade your demands, and I've made mine.
senator...
do you actually believe for one moment that I had anything to do with your wife's kidnapping?
excuse me.
but I just overheard a conversation between the duty agents.
FBI's at acacia reservoir.
they've dispatched search and recovery teams.
it's a cemetery.
southern cross of honor.
I dated a civil war buff.
must have been a confederate graveyard before it flooded.
so, what's that doing there?
grand army of the republic?
it's a union emblem.
I know they called it a civil war, but north and south were never buried together.
sorry, sir, you can't park here.
I need to see chief tyner. - This is a secure crime scene.
I think you need to step aside.
it's all right, officer. Let him through.
why wasn't I notified?
senator, you don't have to be here. Senator, please.
is it sara?
we don't know yet.
sonar imaged a body on the reservoir floor.
we sent down an rov for video.
got a picture.
it's only a statue.
Oh, thank god.
wait, wait. That.
get an image on that.
and then there were nine.
it's upside down.
sacred symbol to the masonic sects, representing god and geometry.
we thought it was a nine, but we were looking at it from the perspective of man.
if you look at it from above, the perspective of god...
it's a G.
you sure it's masonic?
reservoir flooded a civil war graveyard with soldiers from both north and south.
now the only thing superceding a soldier's loyalty to their cause is their loyalty to the masonic order.
well, I get why we'd find it there, but why on valera's palm and the wall in the tunnel?
not sure.
called Quantico, confirmed the symbol's not in c-jis.
search andescue's still on scene.
maybe they'll help answer that.
Hey.
how you doing?
I'm pregnant, ben's in jail, and mom's back.
how do you think I'm doing?
cheese sandwich?
Thanks.
it's not such a bad thing, you know?
having mom around again.
give her a week, tops, she'll be gone.
just as always.
and what did ben say about the baby?
didn't get a chance to tell him.
yeah?
how do you ruin a cheese sandwich?
I'll order a pizza.
it doesn't matter, marcy. You're only 17.
he understands me.
he treats me with respect.
he is taking advantage of you.
you are a minor.
I don't care.
what about his family?
what about his wife?
where do you think that this can possibly lead?
are you going to tell dad?
it would kill him, but he needs to know.
Wallace rainer is aederal judge.
please don't.
you promise me that you will break this off, and I will not tell him that it was you.
Hey.
you okay?
I got to get out of here.
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
you're working, and I don't even know your namE.
and I just quit.
all right, amanda mcneal died in may of '96 around the same time water first flowed into the acacia reservoir, right?
Yeah.
I dug up the transcripts of the city council hearings.
turns out, the creation of the reservoir was a hot-button issue.
I'm listening.
final approval rested on mayor mcneal's vote.
well, obviously, he voted to approve it.
Yeah, but someone really didn't want him to.
two months before the hearing, his wife gets kidnapped.
you think she was held hostage?
his vote was the ransom.
he didn't cave, so they killed her.
drowned her in the very reservoir he voted to create.
that's what he was trying to tell me before he shot himself.
the best way to get to a man is through the woman he loves.
that's how they control you.
now, that makes sense, but why drop amanda's body in the middle of sara collins' investigation?
possibly to give collins a message.
do what we say, or your wife shares amanda's fate.
okay, so, what do they want from the senator?
he's headed to the airport.
the supreme court hearings in D. C.
what's going on?
you're being blackmailed.
your wife for your vote.
you only have to watch the news to know how much is riding on judge rainer's confirmation.
you have no idea.
listen, I cannot stop you from going to D. C.
I'd be doing exactly the same thing if I were you.
but even if you give them what they want, they're going to kill sara.
you don't stack the supreme court and leave witnesses.
without confirming your suppositions...
seems like a man in that situation wouldn't have much of a choice.
what if I could buy you some more time?
time I could use to find sara?
Hey. - Welcome back.
so, how'd it go?
found the bar where nicky johnson worked.
found a wall of photos that documented all employees.
great.
you'd think so.
the photos of nicky were missing.
it's judy.
you remember that goodwill you wanted me to notice?
I'm listening.
well, in one hour, the FBI public information office is going to issue a statement, and I'm giving you an early jump.
you got that?
got it.
I'm standing outside the emergency room at St. Mary's hospital where just moments ago, senator Jeffrey Collins was brought in with severe chest pains and shortness of breath.
sources close to Collins say he suffered what appears to be a minor heart attack.
this couldn't come at a worse time for a white house wanting a swift confirmation for their nominee.
although the judiciary committee is scheduled to vote on the confirmation of judge wallace rainer tomorrow, it is likely that the vote will be postponed until next week at the earliest.
meanwhile, the Sara Collins case has become the focus of well-wishers and armchair detectives the world over.
the Collins estate has been flooded with cards, flowers, and other tokens of support and love.
unfortunately, the fbi's public information office has released no new information, and they continue to keep the details of the Sara Collins investigation closely guarded.
however, we has learned that Ben Wilson has been arrested.
Mr. Wilson was sought for the murder of Mark Valera, who's been implicated in the Sara Collins' abduction.
his arraignment is set for tomorrow morning at the federal courthouse in Atlanta.
reporting live from St. Mary's hospital, this is Judy Nash.
Hey, got your 911. What's going on?
rov found a coffin. We're bringing it up now.
it's a graveyard down there. Am I missing something?
is that thing metal? - Stainless steel.
that's why I called.
no way that thing is civil war era.
you guys drill holes in it?
no. It was like that.
it's clamped shut.
why hide a new coffin in an old graveyard?
we're about to find out.
it's now twelve noon in Salamanca, Spain.
in a short time, world leaders from over a 150 countries will meet here at plaza major,
to sign up to president Ashton's bold new counter-terrorist strategy.
since 9/11 more than 4500 people have been killed in a rising tide of global terror.
those lives will not soon be forgotten.
today, world comes together to take a stand against this violence.
we may be on a brink of historic agreement between western and Arab leaders.
security services are on high alert here in Salamanca,
and we now go live to our news team on the ground,
and our reporter Angie jones. -5, 4, 3, 2...
I am standing inside plaza major in Salamanca, Spain,
where crowds are lined up for a kick-off
of what is, without a question, a landmark summit.
for months now, president Ashton has been working with leaders from five continents,
to forge a new ground-breaking alliance in the ongoing war on terror.
and now here, today, western and Arab leaders
will meet for the first time to formalize this new coalition,
designed to, once and for all, put a stranglehold on international terror.
bring him up.
tell us, angie, what's the mood there? -for the most part, hopeful.
certainly, everyone here is very sympathetic
to those who lost loved ones in a recent bombing.
I did, however, speak to delegates... -what is she doing?
...took a hard line, suggesting that the us foreign policy...
Kevin, shut her down.
that's great. thanks, angie.
Angie, what the hell was that?
not everyone loves this, rex.
why don't you leave the punditry to someone who's paid to have an opinion.
Hey, I'm cool with censorship. I know the American people love that.
come on angie, lighten up.
got it!
for you. -yes. I told her. you wAnna tell her too?
fine.
who is the clown on two?

Kevin, call the archives.
OK, the president is approaching the plaza. all cameras ready.
Angie, we're back in twenty, and remember...
we're here for the summit, not the sideshow.
there are other stories here, rex.
which I don't give a shit about.
unless the protesters set themselves on fire, they're not our story.
Kevin, you got it? -yeah.
this was only last year. I can't believe he's back already.
you know, if we're the only ones who have this... -no, he won't talk.
I mean a year ago we had hill, we had that guy who saved Reagan...
McCarthy.
all of them. it was a total hero piece, Barnes wanted nothing to do with it.
well, that was then. -look, it's a shame...
it would've made a great side story, but we've no time to work it in.
that was then, this is now. ok, guys? we've got our story.
okay.
camera five, give me a single.
three, four, get ready at the podium. three go wide, four you're in close,
I wAnna start with leaders and end with the mayor.

that's good. two, give me crowd.
camera five, give me something else to work with. that's good.
Angie, when this is over I want a fifteen second fill, something to wrap it up.
keep it simple.
want me to dumb it down? -get off it, angie, come on.
therefore, I offer you my city, my heart.
ready with the graphics?
this summit can very well be the defining moment for this presidency.

I heard two shots, and the president fell.
what is he doing? ok, five, stay with that guy.
everyone else, give me Ashton.

that's good, just stay with him, stay with him. hold it there.

Yeah, yeah, coming in.
number three, you gotta do better. -they're not letting me through.
don't give me this bullshit, figure it out!
what the hell was that? -it appears to be an explosion...
camera four, turn around, find out what that was.
Kevin, get the cameras going, we're gonna have to uplink everything we've got.
computer, uplink...
OK, angie, you're on, lets go.
we are live, angie, this is it. go.
I need a minute right now, alright? -shit. get mark to stretch.
I know this is tough, ok? I know that.
we need you to tell us what's going on.
focus, okay?
Angie, please tell us what you're seeing. -deep breath, go.
the president of the united states has been shot.
there have been several gunshots.
it appears there's also bomb that went off outside the plaza.
the people running scared...
mark?
mark, you gotta fill.
it seems that a huge bomb... -oh my god! angie!
Angie!
Angie! come on, kiddo, get up.
cannot believe. turn it off.
good morning, America.
it's now twelve, noon, in Salamanca, Spain.
it's time.
all teams to the control...
it was before he lost it. -c'mon...
six months ago. he's not that guy anymore.
give him a break.
what are the chances he freaks out on me when we walk?
I'd put it at 50-50.
we doing this?
Mr. president.
all teams, this is control. eagle is on the move.
tell us, angie, what's the mood there? -for the most part, hopeful.
certainly, everyone here is very sympathetic
to those who lost loved ones in a recent bombing.
Thanks.
for what?
for getting me back out here.
don't thank me yet.
Mr. president, here we go.
what a beautiful baby.
thank you so much.
a wonderful day.
Hey! drop it.
calm down.
all clear, number five.
South? -all clear.
thank you so much for being here.
this is a wondrous day.
today, we make history.
fellow members of the European union, our friends from Africa...
back annex building should've been cleared. -copy, it'll be cleared.
I've got a flutter on a second floor,
seventh window from the left.

it's just a fan someone left on. we got it.
therefore, I offer you my city, my heart, and my hope.

Barnes, he's a cop. -I don't care, he knows something!
get him out of here!
don't release him!
I've been set up! you've got the wrong person!
control! control, come in.
there's no response from control. -i just spoke with them.
until we find that shooter, we shut this city down.
this never should've happened.
except that it did. and it happened on our watch.
I can't live with that. we'd better find him.
sir, we need your camera. -sure.
Where's the zoom? -right here.
right there, that's where the flutter was.
the shot was up, to the left.
you saw the shooter? -no.
but I saw something like flash of light.
a saw a man in that window, sir. -i'll check it out.
I'm coming with you. -no, no!
if you're wrong, let me take the heat.
sir, did you film this entire thing?
Yes. -show me.
I think I have a shooter on tape.
go forward.
Oh my god! oh my god!
there's a bomb in the podium!
this never should've happened. -find that shooter.
a flash of light.

Jesus, barnes!

Barnes, you were right.

Hi, my name is Sam, nice to meet you. -Howard Lewis, nice to meet you too.
American? -yeah.
Wow! what brings you here?

first time, eh? -in Europe? yeah.
I just felt like it was a right time. what about you?
I go where the moment takes me.
that must be nice. no family, right?
no, none that I know of.
what changed me are kids running around.
are yours with you? -no, they're with their mother.
we got in a sort of a bad patch right now.
I decided to get away for a while...
I'm sorry. -it's fine, it's fine.
I think it's my cue.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you. -nice to meet you too. best of luck.
Yeah, you too.
tell your name. -Anna. -that's a pretty name.
you look about the Same age as my son Nathan.
can I buy her another cone?
Oh, no, it's okay. thank you. -no, really, it's no problem.
no, thank you very much.
Anna, I'm sorry. forgive me.
...president henry Ashton.
welcome.
thank you so much for being here.
this is a wondrous day.
today we make history.
it is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.

answer my god damn question! -veronica!
Veronica!

she threw something! -a gun. it's loaded.
Hey, back up! -listen to me, he's telling the truth!
Veronica! veronica!
Hi, leave a message. -Bev, it's me.
you're gonna see on the news when you wake up in the morning,
that the president has been shot.
he was here, in Spain.
and I think I just saw the guy who did it.
look, I'm all right, I just want you to let the kids know
that I'm fine, and that I love them very much and...
Oh, man i can't believe what i just saw
and I think I got it all on tape. I don't know what to do...
I don't know what to do but i...
sir, we need your camera. -sure.
Where's the zoom? -press this button right here.
that's... that's where the flutter was.
the shot was up, to the left.
you saw the shooter? -i saw something, like a flash of light.
it was... right there, there was something in that window right there!
I saw a man in that window, sir. -i'll go check it out.
I'm coming with you. -no, no!
if you're wrong, let me take the heat.
sir, did you film this entire thing?
Yes. -show me.
I think I have a shooter on tape.
go forward.
Oh my god! oh my god!
there's a bomb in the podium!
medic! we need a medic here!
Anna!
Anna!
where is your mother? where is she?
come with me.
OK.
I gotta get you somewhere safe, then we'll find your mother.
are you ok?
I need your help. I need you to watch her, okay? all right?
her mother is gone, I don't know where she is.
she'll be safe with me, don't worry. -I'll be right back, all right?
I'll be right back. wait for me. -take me with you!
I got to help the police. just stay with this lady.
and I'll be back when I find your mom. I'll be right back, okay? I swear.
I'll be right back.
get out the way!
mom?
police! get out the way!
police! move!
police! police!
he's a cop.
Freeze!
they shot him. they shot him.
mom!
Anna!
mom! mom!
when exactly do we think the changes will be ready?
it's not like I have to make the speech now.
I suppose I can just wing it, how much trouble can I really get myself into?
thing is, we both know my limitations.
are we stopping? -yes sir.
Luke, I'll call you back.
NSA has just confirmed the threat.
control handover complete. -roger that.
Where's Phil?
at the hotel. he's now at the joint chiefs.
he's sending a double. -yeah.
delivering potus to the hotel.
control, reversing the car, potus is returning.
we're going to issue a statement to the press that we'll be deferring...
deferring, that's great.
today of all days...
Christ.
sir, we've used doubles since Reagan.
I'm not sure photoshops is appreciating this a bit.
control, we have potus and we're moving to the castle.
eagle has arrived at the plaza.
control, we have potus and are entering the castle.
sir? -talk to me, Phil.
NSA called about five minutes ago, it's real.
and the summit?
we're not thinking of pulling out entirely. why would we?
do we know who's behind this? -it looks like a local group
with some sort of a vague connection to the mujahideen brigade.
why issue the threat now? -couple of weeks ago,
us special forces uncovered a plot to smuggle a dirty bomb out of morocco.
we took their bomb, and their men, and this may be their retaliation.
they try to kill me as a retaliation?
POTUS is moving.
safe for eagle to exit vehicle. -copy that.
this is them? -that's Suarez.
as far as we can tell, he leads the group.
what do we know about him?
he's from morocco, educated in paris.
he went off the map for a while, but he surfaced in Beirut.
couple of days ago, we intercepted an e-mail between members of his group.
embedded in it were links to maps, blueprints of the area.
it wasn't until this morning that we received the threat.
you talked to joint chiefs, what do they recommend?
that we go after their leadership. -here in Spain?
Morocco.
we have a satellite locked on one of their camps there.
you want me to call in a strike on a friendly Arab nation?
they're harboring terrorists.
in this intel we're certain? -absolutely.
control, we're clear on seven.
why aren't we focusing on the ones who are here and are actually doing this? -we are.
this summit is too important. -i know that sir,
but we're looking for five people out of six million.
we are trying. -try harder.
welcome.
this is a wondrous day.
today we make history.
he doesn't even look like me.
president Ashton, and citizens of the world,
it is with great pleasure that I invite you all to our humble city.
is that thomas? -yes, sir.
I thought he was still inactive. -he was.
well if he's back, why isn't he with me?
we're checking if he's ready.
you sent him out there. -we need someone to sell the double.
sell? he took a bullet for me, Phil.
and look at him.
he doesn't stop punishing himself since.
look, I liked him every bit as much as you did, but we needed to know
we can count on him again, before we put him on your detail.
so you threw him out there to see if he's good?
is that what you do to friends now?
therefore, I offer you my city, my heart and my hope.
this summit can very well be the defining moment for this presidency.
Jesus.
the president appears to have been shot. -my god!
I heard two shots, and the president fell.
get the joint chiefs on the line, now.
Mr. president. -sir.
Mr. president, the chiefs have a satellite lock on their village.
they are ready and waiting.
Ted? -well, there is an issue of when we can go.
we go now.
you can't give the order. you've been shot.
if we go now, we risk telling the world that you weren't really there.
but I wasn't there.
we get the vice-president to do it.
no, we're not going there on the 25th amendment.
tell rick to work up a story that I was shot, but I'm ok.
that's not gonna fly. -if we have to go to some hospital and put on a show,
that's what we're gonna do. we're not sitting this one out.
sir, we have to talk about this... -I'm done talking!
Christ!
sir, we gotta go now! we have to attack. sir?
find out what the hell is going on down there.
Mr. president...
tell them to stand down. -sir, we have to respond.
bombing a camp in morocco would blow this summit out of the water
and that is exactly what the people behind this want me to do.
Mr. president, we have to act strong. -no, we have to be strong.
they sent us a warning because they want us to react.
they know our playbook, they are banking on us doing what we always do.
we will hit back. we have the world's sympathy right now, let's...
...honor that. let's finish what we came here to do.
OK, copy that. sir, everything is being prepared to transport the president.
alright, that's it, we need to get the president to air force one, right now.
I'm done hiding, Phil. this is the president, is my wife there?
we have to be better than this. -sir.
Yeah, get air force one ready, and send a chopper... -hey, it's me.
no, we're fine, we're safe.
good morning, America.
it's now twelve noon, in Salamanca, Spain.
I am standing inside plaza major in Salamanca, Spain.
this is for good luck.
I want to know if he's okay.
this was taken fifteen minutes ago,
I think you'll find that we're taking good care of your brother.
what have you done to him?
he's still in one piece, you should be happy about that.
if you do what you're supposed to do your brother will be fine, but if you fail,
then this will be the last thing you'll have to remember him by.
you look out for yourself.
I'll be at the underpass.
Louis. stick with the protesters. they never see this side of the story.
to the last detail.
the beauty of American arrogance is that they cannot imagine a world
where they're not a step ahead.
reception.
control, we have potus and are entering the castle.
copy that. eagle has arrived at the plaza.
Javier. -yeah.
are you in the position? -i'm on my way. -good.
for the moment the Americans think they've dodged the bullet,
do not be late. -don't worry about me.
I won't. your brother spoke very highly of your special forces training.
do not disappoint him.
you just make sure my brother will be at the underpass.
how's our boy doing?
are we go?
what are you seeing?
I think it's my cue.
Yeah, it was nice to meet you. -best of luck.
let's make ourselves a shooter.
that should keep him occupied.
eagle is down! let's go, move it!
control room clear. -do you have the frequency?
control. come in, control.
we need a 20 on potus.
control. come in, control.
control!
take care of him.
let's go.
this is control, there are agents down.
I repeat, agents down.
we have a situation at the front requiring immediate backup.
heading to the lobby to assist.
move, move, move!
everything's clear on seven.
get air force one ready and send a chopper so we can get outta here.
no, we're fine, we're safe.
get up! get up!
multiple casualties, I repeat, multiple casualties.
Hey!
we need your help... now.
C'mon.
he's got no pulse.
secret service. I need to see your tapes. -yeah...
I need to see any footage you have of the back part of the plaza.
OK. give me footage of the back part of plaza on two.
again...
two... again!
washington, this is agent barnes. -go ahead.
control is down, my partner is in pursuit of a suspect.
we need immediate assistance. just outside the back annex.
copy that. give me a heading.
headed west on a surface street. do you copy?
heading west, copy that.
backup is on its...
what? barnes, what is it?
Barnes?
Oh my god!
no. if you're wrong, let me take the heat.
Barnes, you were right.
about what? -about the shooter.
I'm in pursuit lead at the back annex, heading west.
Barnes, what is it?
Barnes!
secret service, get out of the car!
Washington.
this is barnes. -go ahead.
look, I know how this is gonna sound unbelievable, but agent Taylor has gone rogue.
what?
you gotta call the other agents back.
I know I made the call, but there's something else going on here.
control is compromised.
listen to me, damn it!
God damn it!
let him go.
what are you talking about? -my brother.
I've done my part, now you let him go.
put the gun down. -make the call,
or I pull the trigger and your plan is finished.
again.
go ahead. do it.
do it and your brother is dead.
can you live with that?
knowing that your brother died because of you.
Javier, listen to me.
he is going to be delivered at the underpass.
don't mess it up now.
you'll get your brother back.
nothing...
nothing...
had better happen to him.
nothing will.
shit.
this is agent Barnes again. I've lost agent Taylor,
I need a GPS location on his cellular. -copy that.
we did it.
not yet.
mommy!
Yeah! -barnes, potus has been abducted.
present location unknown. no signal for Taylor's phone.
it's imperative we locate and apprehend Taylor.
son of a bitch.
he fell down. -leave him.
it's me.
they bought it. -what about barnes?
he took the bait. he's pissing in the wind.
he has created a manhunt for a shooter that doesn't exist.
have you got Javier? we may need him later.
I'm on my way.
I thought he was supposed to be dead.
we need to tie up all of the loose ends.
who's the loose end?
you are.
give me the keys
let's go, let's go!
relax we've pulled it off
this is agent barnes, I've located Taylor.
he's driving Salamanca police vehicle, registration s-073654.
headed south, repeat, south.
that looks bad. we've waited for this too long thank god this double life is almost over.
just get me to my brother
Christ, it's Barnes.
we got company.
it's Barnes.
can you lose him? -I'm working on it.
C'mon, c'mon!
just relax
shit!
have you lost him? -I'm still working on it.
well, until you do, stay clear of the rendezvous. All right?
no, we go to the underpass now. -You heard what he said.
I'm picking up my brother.
are you out of your mind? I worked too hard for this.
either you're coming with me, or I'll drive myself. You choose.
shit.
Oh, shit!
shit! Get him off my ass.
happy?
just drive.
Where's my brother? -Surprised to see me alive?
where is Veronica? -Veronica said that...
I don't care what she said! You both tried to kill me.
Where's my brother?
Where's my brother?
looks like we've both been set up.
mom!

God damn you! You used me!
I trusted you, you son of a bitch!
who's got POTUS?

are you alright?
Mr. President?
Barnes, is that you?
Mr. President.
I've got you.
can you sit up?
are you injured? -Yeah.
but it's not important.
this is Agent Thomas Barnes.
POTUS is in hand.
I repeat, POTUS is in hand.
we need a pick-up seven blocks east of the Plaza.
Hello? -Oh, thank God. Howard, are you okay? Are you hurt?
no, I'm... -Are you sure? Are you okay?
I'm fine.
we got your message. Are you sure you're alright?
Yeah! No, I'm... I'm fine.
I'm fine.
thank you, Thomas.
you're welcome, sir.
reports out of Salamanca now suggest that the President is out of intensive care.
his condition is listed as stable.
president Ashton has made a point of reassuring Americans that he's alright, and that summit will continue in days to come.
meanwhile, word from Spanish and the United States authorities is that they shot and killed the lone assassin responsible for today's attack.
on that our John McKendrick has more.
am I all packed, Gary? - Yeah, we're all covered.
vice - Or a ballerina or modern dancer. - Okay, it's fine.
is there an indoor pool at this place? I packed my swimsuit.
why are you asking me that? And have we heard from the president on the economic forum?
uh, yeah. Last I heard, he was three over par.
huh? - Oh, forum's not happening.
POTUS took a golf day. Do you know who he's playing golf with?
no, who? - No, no, no, who?
Oh, you don't know and you want me to find out.
Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Sorry.
Dan. Dan Egan. - Hey.
the
good to see you again, buddy. I miss your emails.
long time no cc. Still up here in Cleveland, huh, will?
just rutting around with the regional swine?
slaving away for Furlong? Well, I am the senior advisor now.
so I get free wi-fi. I'll be going to D. C.. A lot more.
Oh, my God. With that provincial sensibility and that girlish figure, you're not gonna last.
listen, Dan, the congressman expects your boss to endorse him for governor.
Yeah, we're aware of that. It's gotten a bit complex, all right?
so the congressman would like to speak with you in his room.
if you'd just join me, okay?
Ah, I recognize you. You're one of Selina's little gay dwarves, aren't you?
what, are you sappy? Is that it? Preppy? Actually, my name is Dan Egan.
you might remember, actually, I used to work for congresswoman Hayes.
Oh, my gosh, of course I don't remember that.
listen, I need your help, buddy. I need you to go back and tell Selina that I don't want her to endorse me for governor, okay?
she's about as welcome here as a turd in a hot tub.
well, that could be a bit of an issue.
we're trying to run a fundraiser and she's kind of toxic at the box office, all right?
we're having to bump our silver plates up to gold plates, gold plates are going up to platinum plates.
I'd make more money if I installed will here as a full-time gloryhole greeter at a Georgetown gay bar.
which I'm pretty sure he already does part-time.
right, will? - Yes, sir.
congressman, she's on her way here right now.
so what? There's plenty to do here in Cleveland.
send her to the rock and roll hall of fame. First time I took this kid, one look at Kurt Cobain's shoes, he was bawling like a fucking baby.
it's too soon! It's too soon!
ma'am, Martin Collins, the secret service guy we reassigned...
Mm-hmm. - He's back. He's been un-reassigned.
are you kidding me? - Not great, admittedly.
not great, admittedly"? Yeah, that should be the title of my fucking memoir.
he's not outside here, is he? Oh, hi!
Oh, my! Okay, great.
all right, that's all I want to say to him for the rest of my life.
Hey, approval ratings just came through.
Oh. - 66%.
what? - Approve.
Oh! - Sorry, disapprove.
Oh. - Dis...
you know what? You go ride with the security detail.
there's no room for you in this car.
she can thank the troops, she can charm all the mouth-breathers, and then she can go back to D. C. No big deal.
the one thing she will not be doing is standing up and endorsing me. You got me?
I get the stamp of approval from her, and I might as well nail a bunch of puppies to the ground and then start running them over and crush their skulls with my campaign bus.
all due respect, we did have a...
informal understanding that she would endorse your run for governor.
all right, well, all due respect, cock nugget, there's been a little too much of this informal understanding going on around here.
isn't that right, will? - Yes, sir.
clean jobs was your office, right?
and its role in the Macauley amendment.
getting senator Macauley to sneak in the VP's lame-ass legislation against the president's will.
Macauley thing, yeah, that didn't happen.
will, tell him who I am.
sir, you're the vice chair of the congressional oversight committee.
and in that capacity, I have a duty to shine a light on any of this kind of backseat, finger-fucking insider bullshit, Dan.
thank you for your time, congressman.
I will do what I can.
don't endorse.
she seems nice.
cause of that smiling secret service guy, Amy, 66% disapprove.
that's everyone in America who's awake right now.
okay, let's not concentrate on that today. Let's concentrate on Ohio.
CLEVLAND
how could that many Americans not like me?
I think they got it wrong. They counted those numbers wrong or something.
or all those Americans are completely wrong.
okay, this is the hotel manager. We promised him four seconds.
madam Vice President. Welcome to our hotel.
we have to take the vice president away. Apologies.
why have I been given this pig's blood?
it's tomato juice. It's the Ohio state beverage.
Oh, piss. Ma'am. - Yeah?
they're having trouble moving big donor tickets.
what? - Yeah.
Why? Because of me? - No.
Amy, you're gonna have to start getting everyone to like me.
ma'am. Hi. Good news.
we are not exactly selling that many platinum level tickets. I just gave her that news.
Yeah, but it was so much more depressing coming out of you.
not to worry. I have a strategy.
okay, look, we smile the smiles, we shake the hands, but we do not endorse. We give the press nothing to report.
no, that makes me look even weaker.
all right, ma'am, I... - Hey.
I really think this is something to consider.
greetings from the clubhouse of power, Amy.
you need to know that the White House understands just how toxic the veep is after these latest numbers.
it's a tough time, we're aware.
do you want to know how toxic she is, Amy?
imagine something small has crawled up a dead cow's ass.
and then that small thing actually dies itself.
if that dead thing then farted out a sack of eggs, but each individual egg is a smaller, rotting dead thing, that's how toxic she is.
okay, thanks for the input.
and I know you're under a lot of pressure over there, so if you ever need a shoulder to cry on or a bootie to call on, you have my number...
did you find out who the president's playing golf with?
golf. You know, men walking around with sticks - talking about their careers. - Oh, mm.
I was gonna follow up on that, ma'am. I didn't forget.
I did not forget.
ma'am, it's congressman Furlong.
well, you can tell him to go fuck him... - He's right here, ma'am.
Oh! Roger. - Madam Vice President.
thank you so much for seeing me. Well, thank you for dropping by.
excuse me while I get myself pulled together.
of course. I like this room. This is great.
Yeah, it's the presidential suite. Vice presidential, anyway.
listen, I've seen the disapproval numbers.
so I appreciate the delicate situation here.
uh, just part of the job.
no, it's not. This is Will.
will, what were they saying about the disapproval?
apologies, ma'am. "Effed in the b-hole" across all networks.
ma'am, that is a lingering image to try to overcome, I'll tell you.
what's this about, congressman?
well, I was hoping maybe, ma'am, we could have a moment.
Yes. Have a seat. - Thank you.
ma'am, I don't want you to endorse my run for governor at this time.
um, well, Roger, - that is difficult... - Mm-hmm.
for me because I'm here.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's great. Can I get some water?
um, it's being put to me...
Gary, can I get some water? - Yeah.
it's being put to me that... and I apologize...
but politically speaking, you are damaged goods.
I'm hearing that your credibility is...
where is it located, will? - The toilet.
Mm-hmm. Again, not my words.
so... - The toilet?
I don't want this. - Okay.
more accurately, the crapper. - Who are you?
who is this fucking infant? - No one.
let me be very clear with you about something, okay, Roger?
I don't even like you.
right. - Right?
and now I'm, you know, been told to come here and endorse you.
so do you understand how embarrassing this would be for me now not to endorse you?
Yes, of course. I get it, yeah.
and listen, in the spirit of reciprocity, ma'am,
I don't really care for you much either personally.
you can't stop me from endorsing you.
then I will reject the endorsement publically. Madam Vice President, do you need five minutes?
no, I don't need five minutes. I'm absolutely fucking fine.
thank you very much.
you know, Roger, do you sometimes think about,
I don't know, I give you this and you give me that and black is up, but brown is down now?
do you know what I mean? - Mm-hmm.
I mean, in life or even just with love, you know, I mean, at the end of the day, you know, aren't we just all finally just, you know, people?
true words, ma'am. - Yeah.
I mean, you know, I haven't...
I haven't seen my... my daughter in, like, three months.
and Ted is just, you know, whaa!
I don't know where he went, you know? You know, and I would...
I would love to go to that party, you know?
I would like to be everywhere.
look, Madam Vice President, I'm sorry.
this doesn't give me any pleasure. Don't you say it gives you no pleasure.
when anybody ever says that, all they mean is that it does give them so much pleasure.
look... - I know what that means.
maybe you should make an address, okay?
talk about politics and America working together.
I know how to give a motherfucking speech.
don't you patronize me with your no jaw.
you congressman no jaw.
okay, ma'am. We should... we have to go.
get the fuck out. - Okay. Okay.
he was just not a nice man. I'll get you some tea, okay?
I'll just leave Mike. He can stay here with you.
I'm sorry about your tears. - Yeah.
they suck.
you know, my papaw used to say, "it's always darkest before the storm. " So...
Oh, the dawn, the dawn.
it's always darkest before the dawn. " And then he would kiss me.
all right, this might sound crazy, but go with it.
her crying was very authentic and humanizing.
okay.
I like your thinking.
I actually found it slightly erotic, too. I take it back.
that's why it took me so long to split up with Angie.
she'd always cry, I'd always get a hard-on.
now you've lost me. - Listen.
we should spitball on this, though.
the crying game play, all right?
all we've got to do is set her up and let the cameras roll.
then we've just got to tweak the tear nipple.
how do we make it happen?
could spray her with pepper spray.
call her fat. Kidding.
what is it that made her cry? It's Catherine, right?
the absent mother blubber.
genius. - Yeah.
chinese daughter torture. It's a good one. I can't believe we're doing this.
on the other hand, we are currently polling lower than a side of beef with eyes drawn on it, so...
okay, ma'am, light and frothy. - Yeah.
cappuccino politics, okay? Big three industries in Ohio...
rubber, petrochemical, agriculture. - Right. Okay.
hit rubber. It's a big rubber state. - Okay. Good. Yeah.
what is that, a fax? Is that a message to yourself from 1988?
look who's playing golf with the president.
Chung. - Shut up.
what is that? - Don't worry about it.
Felicia, one second. Feel free to dive right in on the daughter, okay?
cause we want to hit these disapproval ratings head on.
see, when he says things like that to me, it makes me anxious.
we just found out that governor Chung is golfing with potus.
so, if you want to talk about that... - All right.
thank you so much.
it is just great to be back in the state of Ohio.
been a rough couple of months for you, though. Your filibuster reform stalled.
clean jobs initiative, dead in the water.
you talk a lot about really wanting to be able to make change.
do you still think you're gonna be able to make that happen?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I'm very proud of what we've been able to achieve thus far.
so you feel you're back in the game? Well, it's not a game to me.
must be very hurtful to you, too, with all the gossip going around.
is she gonna go? I just understand today that the president is golfing with governor Chung.
does that bother you?
well, I mean, the president can play golf with whoever he likes.
but I'm here because I have work to do.
it's 24/7. It's a public duty.
24/7 doesn't leave you much time for your family, your daughter.
well, I mean, it's a punishing schedule, that's for sure.
I mean, you get... you get tired and you get knocked... knocked back.
but...
can you imagine, Felicia, if I'm tired, imagine how tired the rubber makers are here in Ohio.
she is magnificent.
making rubber day in and day out.
I feel that Ohio is the rubber ball state, if you think about it. Always bouncing back.
ohio
I don't know what the hell she could have been thinking.
when was the last time you cried twice in one day?
it was a little more recently than you'd think.
oddjob.
come here. What the fuck gives with your boss? I saw the meltdown.
congressman, I saw passion. I saw conviction.
I saw a fucking crazy lady. That's what I saw.
if she mentions my name, if I get the stamp of approval, the midas touch from Jenny shitfinger, I'm coming for you, pal.
me and the congress of the United States will get your ass. Yes, sir.
ask your buddy Macauley about it. Maybe he can help you.
the vice president.
Hello! Yes. I see you.
Oh, wow, look at this group.
are they gonna live long enough to make it to election day, right behind me? Probably not.
Hello, children who do not vote.
we're getting great media response to the interview.
are you getting this, too? - No, better.
I've been polling the room. It's warm, it's friendly.
if this plays in Ohio, it's gonna go national.
come on, Amy.
Marcus. - What?
I made you a cake with your face on it.
are you kidding me? Oh!
that looks like me after a long day in the Senate.
I think she's only paid 50 bucks. I have to go.
madam Vice President. - Yes?
I'd like to introduce you to one of our actual platinum donors.
I have some great ideas about tax reform I want to talk to you about.
I want to hear them. - Well, there's two types of people.
Uh-huh. - Okay? You got grabbers.
and then you have the other kind. I don't have a name for that. The ones who don't grab.
the grabbers, right, - they take the world by the scrotum, okay? - Oh.
and they make it happen. - This is just riveting stuff.
Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry. - Yes?
I don't know what to say, so I'm just whispering instead.
Oh, I have the...
middle east. - You can talk later.
we have all night. - I appreciate that. Hello. Uh-huh.
I just want to eat in a quiet corner away from these bozos, okay?
and that's the essence of a grabber.
okay? - Mm-hmm.
you'd think with all the money I'm jerking up the wall here,
I'd get more than a stuffed chicken breast.
right, well, you know, I've got to tell you, these caterers, they've got...
I gave 30, 000 bucks, I get a chicken breast.
that guy didn't give 500 bucks, he's got a chicken breast.
what do I get, stuffing? - Mm-hmm.
okay. - Throw me a drumstick or something.
Larry. - Hey.
it's good to see you. - Why, you need a lawyer?
all right, look. Listen.
I may have gotten involved in a little something.
what happens if I get called in before a congressional committee?
okay, you need three versions of your statement.
Uh-huh, like what I say happened, what they say happened, and the truth?
right?
a written, an oral, and a shorter oral - in case of a time limit. - Right.
Yeah, you want to tell a congressional committee the truth, Dan.
anything out of line, you're looking at a perjury charge.
fuck! Don't call attention to yourself, all right?
just lay low, keep your head down.
all right, now let's say this does actually happen and I get called in, what's it like up there?
you know those dreams where your football coach is screaming at you, you look down, you're dressed like Shirley Temple and then all your teeth fall out?
that's like a Disney version of a congressional committee.
you're gonna get hometown, downtown questions.
you'll catch partisan shit. There's gonna be grandstanding.
and if they smell blood, if they think you're going down and there's gonna be a kill, you might get what we call corpse fucking.
Jesus. Corpse fucking?
that's what it's called where they take your mortal remains and have as much fun with it as they can.
cause everybody wants to be the guy getting the TV sound bite, okay?
and they're gonna be talking about you.
Yeah. - Yeah.
thank you so much.
thank you so, so, very, very much. Good evening, everyone.
what are you doing? Sir, this crying is tracking pretty well.
what?
Oh, shit. - Yeah, it's good.
okay, that changes everything. She's someone I know you know very well.
Hey, come here. - Relax, okay?
I spoke to her. You spoke to her. She's not gonna fucking endorse.
no, no, no. We want her to endorse now.
okay? She's gone from toxic to turn-on.
so just... when we give you the nod, give her the signal, all right?
you guys are burning a fucking hole through my stomach.
I just spent all afternoon fixing this for you.
now you want me to unfix it? - Is this your first day in the game?
I think he's wrapping up, so...
okay. - How you feeling?
well, I'm a political leper, and I'm an emotional time bomb.
so here's an idea... let's put me onstage.
ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.
so wonderful. Thank you.
please be seated. Thank you so much. It is my very...
come on, what are you waiting for? Give her the signal.
what the fuck is the signal? There's no international signal to endorse.
use your fucking head. Give her a thumbs up or something.
Oh, my goodness. Well, this has been quite the day, hasn't it?
we love you!
thank you very much. She can't cry three times in a day.
that's three strikes and you're out. How big are her tear ducts?
it's like they're fucking tidal. Such a happy occasion, and...
Jesus Christ. Fuck it, don't endorse.
I'm so glad to be here in the 17th state of the union.
my grandfather, he was from Cincinnati, as a matter of fact.
we used to have a saying in our family.
we used to say we're awfully embarrassed by our buckteeth.
but we were mighty proud of our buckeyes.
okay, endorse. Endorse. Endorse.
you're sure? - Endorse. Yes.
I, um...
I still miss my grandpa.
what is that, Popeye?
no, be strong. - He was the best.
he was... he was such a strong man from a great state.
and so that's why I've come here today.
ENDORSE!!
I've come here today to give my 100% support to congressman Roger Furlong to be the next, the best, governor of Ohio.
that's right.
that's you. Come on up here.
what the hell just happened?
so great to be part of your feel-good moment.
you're a dirty little prick.
Oh, boy. Thank you so much.
Absolutely. - Oh, boy.
don't forget your booster seat. Oh, shove it up your ass.
thanks so much. - Okay.
Hey, that photographer who reads lips, - he's not here, is he? - Mm-mmm.
no. That's a blessing.
did you see the "Chicago Tribune"?
Oh, this is so great. I've never enjoyed reading this much.
you know, my mom said that Selina looked human and vulnerable.
great. - Not a compliment.
she sees human vulnerability as a weakness.
I like your mom. - Don't talk about my mother, Dan.
good morning! - Did you see the "Chicago Tribune"?
I've seen it, I've read it, I've eaten it, I've showered in it. I'm back, my babies.
Yeah, you are. Like rubber Jesus.
and, Dan, get over here and shake my hand.
what a great job you did. - My pleasure.
seriously, getting me to endorse Furlong. How about that round of applause?
come on, guys. Give it up for him.
absolutely great.
you know none of these people generally like you. So fucking what?
Hey, everyone. Oh, hey!
Hey, it's about time. Thank you.
Hey, Mike.
POTUS is so excited about this new narrative.
I engineered Selina crying on camera.
I'm the puppet master. I'm Pinocchio.
pinocchio wasn't the puppet master, Mike. He was the puppet.
uh, yeah, he was. - Five-year-olds get that.
Jonah, do you come bearing news from the gentleman's club?
I come bearing a message of support from the president.
no. - Huh.
well, it wasn't an actual call.
I am here in lieu of that call. - Uh-huh.
but he and we are... - I have a very big announcement to make.
I'd like everyone to follow me into my office, please.
this-a-way. Okay, so I am about to announce a certain realignment.
Oh, Mike. I am sorry for your loss.
Dan, you're getting a promotion.
thank you so much. - You're welcome.
I just signed for an auto lease. If I could get six months...
I want you to be in charge of day-to-day rebuttal for me, all right?
you'll be the new director of policy and presentation.
thank you, ma'am. This is all I've ever wanted.
this is all I've never wanted. Is he... is Dan my boss now?
can I just say that this is really exciting to watch?
I guess I've got some business to attend to.
what business? - That's a need-to-know basis, Mike, and you don't have the clearance.
funny. Is that true?
this is sad. You're like an old panda that's gonna get put down at the zoo.
they bring kids in to watch that. - Fuck off.
I'm assuming I'm safe.
Amy, you pretended to have a miscarriage for me. You remain crucial to my policy team.
all right, boys and girls, I got a promotion.
so first order of business is to issue a press release, which I already have written.
colette, if you would do the honors. In the me file under phase one.
okay, and you and you, I need you to move this desk.
let's go. Don't give me that sad orphan face.
take your little snack pack and your water bottle and get the fuck out.
Hey, Dan. - Yes?
congrats on the big promotion. You and I should grab another drink.
you know what? Run it by my secretary. His name is Mike.
no, no, no, you've got to move that back.
I'm not gonna have you eyeballing me all day.
that's not gonna go there. - Relax, cow eyes.
I'm not gonna be sitting here looking at your...
cow eyes the whole time. Guys, seat goes right here.
shit, shit. - What? What? What?
twitter eruption. Veep's trending.
Amy, what's going on? - Um, you're trending, ma'am.
I'm on Twitter, but it wants me to create a new account.
I don't know how to do that. - Well, then do that.
Amy, what the fuck? What is it, Amy?
this is the reporter from Ohio, Felicia.
wait, wait. No, I got it.
got played by team veep. They wanted me to make her cry.
hashtag FakeVeepWeep. What the fuck?
what? Who wanted to make me cry? Mike engineered your crying, ma'am.
he said that he was your puppet master.
actually, he said he was your Pinocchio, but I think he meant Geppetto, who was actually the puppet master.
Mike got you to cry on camera.
what the fuck, Mike? - What the fuck, Mike?
Amy, get into my office. Mike, especially you.
go into my office. Okay.
holy Christ. Look at the size of this one.
buddy, I think you're as big as my gay dwarf.
I need to see the vice president now.
sorry, I don't work here. I do work in the West...
well, then get the hell out of my way, you leaning tower of...
Pisa. - No.
shit? - Good.
move it. - Yes, sir.
Hey, sweet cakes. I need to get in to see the veep.
congressman, if you call me that again, you'll need to see a paramedic.
take care of that. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
big bully, what are you doing? - You think I'm a crybaby?
sorry to barge in, Madam Vice President.
Yeah, Larry, listen. Furlong is in the office.
don't talk to Furlong. You need to keep a low profile.
I just issued a press release announcing my promotion.
Bye, Dan.
frankly, ma'am, I'm angry. Will, tell her why.
the press claims that you intentionally cried in order to divert attention away from the fact that we had to bus people into the fundraiser.
and now I'm being implicated in your disgusting little lies, and, actually, I don't feel like being dragged into the toilet with you, ma'am.
number one, congressman, I'm sick of taking your shit, okay?
number two, number one again.
the crying was manipulated, ma'am. I was manipulated.
and this meeting is now terminated because this was never a meeting to even begin with.
you're gonna need to leave 'cause I'm not really aware of where my actions will take me, okay?
what are you gonna do? You gonna choke me with some spanx?
do you want to try me?
you got breath mints in that bag? Let's go.
Oh, you got a nice big red dot in the middle of your forehead, Danno.
and it ain't a fucking bindi. - Excuse me?
you'd better saddle up, cowgirl, 'cause I'm gonna ride this whole office into a congressional investigative hearing over the Macauley amendment and the attendant corruption. Just relax.
I think you might want to get yourself a helmet, okay.
and a bulletproof vest and an iron jockstrap.
cause you're gonna get your head shot, your back stabbed, and your nuts danced on.
have a good Monday.
Bye, Sue.
all right, you're gonna need to stay in your former position.
okay? Keep a low profile.
in your face, Dan. Mmm!
um, ma'am, I may have already issued a press release - regarding my promotion. - Really?
well, can I unpromote you? I don't think so.
is he my boss again? Only in title, all right? You're still senior to him.
in your fucking face. - Stop it, okay? Please, Mike.
Hey, Dan, I'm gonna take a rain check on that beer, okay?
Oh, my God in heaven. So, let's see.
the guy that I have just put in charge of rebutting is now in charge of rebutting questions over the Macauley amendment, which is the very thing he should be nowhere near rebutting.
right? - I did warn you about him, ma'am.
okay, get out, Amy. Get out of my office.
see, now... now I want to cry.
but I can't cry.
can I get you a cup of tea? Okay. - Yeah.
you know, I mean, this job has fucked me up so bad.
now I don't fucking know if I can cry anymore.
I wouldn't worry about it, ma'am.
I mean, you've only got four years of this, so...
eight years, I guess, if we got reelected, obviously.
12 if you run for president.
16, two-term.
so think about that.
egan, all right? Dan Egan.
that's Dan with a capital D and Egan with an open your fucking ears.
Yes, E as in ears.
Yeah, I'll hold.
when Dan goes home, I want that desk back here, okay?
no, she's busy. And tomorrow.
well, that's tomorrow in the plural.
all of them.
it's Terrence Cook and...
miss Dumass, the journalism teacher.
who died ithe bus crash
he also has some gambling issues
I have information about that mexican kid who got killed
your 911 caller, aka Tom Griffith is Dr. Tom Griffith
our favorite plastic surgeon seems to be owned by the fighting Fitzpatricks
Hey, daddy
so you guys were like a couple?
I was madly in love and 100% gay
what is that?
what do you call yours?
Dick! You totally nailed me
Oh, man. So you're the fingernails chick from my new year's party
I did nail you
that's funny. I remember you taller and less uppity
my car just now
Oh, jeez
maybe we should get the highway patrol down here and take some pictures or something
give me a break
I barely even touched your stupid door
you left some paint. Look
it's only the most valuable thing on your car
you might want to frisk her before you get in the backseat
she could be smuggling junk
you're ones to talk. Baseball players, right?
remind me. Which one of you pitches and which one catches?
relax, Dick, we're not saying that you're gay
just because you make out with a dude here and there
strawberry soda. It's a fine choice
well, where were we?
Oh, yes, I remember
you sure you don't want to take this somewhere else more private like the trunk of your car.
it's called a stolen moment 'cause we're sneaky about it."
ever consider that maybe you're not as notorious as you think you are?
come on. Admit it. Your dad went off on you for getting cuddly with me at the carnival, right?
my dad didn't say a thing
maybe it's just that I really want to be alone with you
so when do you want to be alone with me again?
Saturday
I'm staying at my dad's this weekend
you can come by and watch a movie if you want
I want
I got Lamb turning my house upside down
I got the paparazzi following me day and night just waiting for me to fall apart and make a run for my bronco
I swear, there's a news chopper following me around
if Lamb doesn't press charges if you're not indicted this media frenzy will be gone before you know it
let's concern ourselves more with keeping you out of jail
how? I mean, you said it yourself
if all it took was a phone call to blow up that bus anybody could have done it from anywhere
so why not me? A gambler, a cheater, a deadbeat
who's gonna stop. You had me at "gambler.
Terrence, relax
just tell me what you can remember from the day of the crash
I met those kids out at the park. And like I said
I talked with Woody, signed some stuff
I was out of there around 5: 00, I guess
the bus went over at 7: 03
next thing I can remember was around 11: 00 maybe when I turned on the tv and heard the news
you don't remember anything you did in between 5: 00 and 11: 00?
Nope
you got something to say?
you remember nothing?
where were you at 7: 03 that day
I suppose I don't know
well, maybe you blew up the bus "Who will spot the imposter cheering in the second row?"
how long can my pep-squad smile hide the me I cannot show?
Wow. That is so precious, Marlena
and you even made it rhyme, just like an indigo girls song
I didn't write that
got it. Must be some other pep-squad lez who has her gym locker next to mine
Oh, wait. Here's my favorite part "Taking off our clothes, I put on my disguise"
but when we're in the shower, can madison feel my eyes?
I've got a problem
have you heard about the pizza-boy muggings
I heard about Corny
Yeah, Corny was victim number five. I was number four
look, I need you to find the guy who ripped me off
sounds like a police matter to me
I had something in my wallet
a list that wasn't supposed to get out ever
that whole Marlena thing
it was my fault
I don't get it
well, Marlena's name was on a list with nine other gay students
that poem everyone was making fun of, Marlena posted it onto a website that I set up
you set up a poetry website?
a chat room. It's called the pirate's ship
you know,"Student Homosexual Internet Posting."
I was in charge of maintaining user names and passwords
only the list
I follow. But why would a mugger want to out sweet little Marlena?
because she didn't have the $5, 000 he demanded from her to stay in
why can't the evil just get jobs like the rest of us?
look. We're willing to pay you
who's "we," and what are you offering?
I can't give you names, but we're each good for $100
find out who's doing the blackmailing, all right?
so what they'd get off you, Corny?
Oh, all the cash and my tunes. Oh, and the pizza, you know?
it was pperoni, thick crust
it was a real nice pie
sound like the guy who mugged you?
Yeah, same part of town even. I got hit in south Neptune, down on alvarado
do you think they were real orders?
no. Bogus. Mr. Cho called both places back after the muggings
the people there hadn't ordered pizzas
either of you remember the names that went with the fake orders?
Yeah, man, I do. You know Amy Asparzo from gym class?
that's whose house I was headed to
I remember distinctly 'cause I was like, "damn, what if Amy answers the door in her unmentionables"?
that would've been sweet
can you get me a list of the names and addresses the mugger used, Ryan?
first of all, I'm not letting her learn to surf on one of my boards
I'd sooner let her paddle out on my mother
of course you would. Right?
I'm thinking she can come with us to cabo
Hey, you two look like you're in the market for some spirit paraphernalia
I recommend the buttons
they're awful tempting
well, they're for a really good cause
that was sarcasm, by the way
dude, you know where we got to go?
we got to go to scorpion bay again
Thanks. Camping on the beach.
endless right-point break
that's our place, man
I need your help, Veronica
sorry, Kylee. I'm working at capacity right now
you don't understand.
I'm being blackmailed
it's just...Ryan told me I could talk to you
Really? You're being blackmailed?
sorry to blow your mind, but I'm a lesbian, Veronica
Oh. Well...that's cool.
only when you're in college
did you bring the blackmail note?
I don't have that kind of money. I'm dead
respond to the e-mail. Ask for another 24 hours
I'll handle the cash and drop-off, okay?
Thanks, Veronica.
got it.
mars Investigations
sure.
Thanks. I'll let him know
they're gonna fax through that credit-card statement you asked for
good. Thanks, honey
Terrence Cook's credit-card statement
So...are we working for accused mass murderers now?
that's right
you sure you're not clouded by your years of being his biggest fan?
I don't know. Maybe
let's just call it a gut thing
besides, I thought you'd be excited
by what? If Terrence is guilty, that means I'm off the hook?
everyone didn't die because of me?
excited that I'm helping your friend's dad
where are you getting your int?
Jackie and I aren't exactly the sisterhood of the traveling pants
she's not what you'd call huggable
whereas you warm right up to people? Hmm
hum
I wanna help.
and your gut is good enough for me
I need to feel like I'm doing something right now
Terrence will be by in a bit
would you mind making a couple calls for me?
no sweat.
you can head right in
Hi. This is Veronica Mars calling from Mars Investigations
I've got calls made to your agent, your brother, your assistant -- on and on
no one seems to know where you were when you made them
got something - My daughter - Yeah, we've met
you know the name Hank Melton
no
he works for mint condition car detailing off the interstate
Oh, crazy Hank? Yeah, I know that guy
he works on my car whenever
Veronica, can you give us a minute?
I call Hank whenever I hit the Seven Rivers casino
so you were in the casino that day, possibly when the bus crashed?
I say it's likely
that's great news. Casinos happen to be the most photographed places on earth
good luck getting that surveillance footage, Keith
do you know who Leonard Lobo is?
the guy who runs Seven Rivers?
actually, several of the indian casinos
what's Lobo got against you?
millions of dollars' worth of outstanding debt
you know those guys the sheriff caught loitering outside of my house?
delivering a message for Leonard Lobo
his way of saying that my payments are overdue
Mr. Pleacher and the Neptune High Science department would like to invite you all to the Annual Physics Olympics
Competitiowill be held...
last night was a bust?
what, two hours spent tracking a dummy e-mail address?
maybe this will help. All the names and addresses to any ordered pizzas
you got to do something, Veronica
I'm getting like 100 e-mails a day from my pirate's ship. peers
they're really starting to freak - What? You know one of them? - Yeah
let's go to Kylee Marker for the story. She's outin the parking lot live.
the pizza-boy mugger added to his repertoire
although the M. O. Was the same, a taser to the neck, this time he chose a seemingly random victim
baseball player Kelly Kuzzio
after lastight's game, I stopped at sac-n-pac to grab a drink.
got out of my car and bam! Lights out.
he took my watch, my wallet. But what really sucked
he stole my rims. Six grand those cost me.
before I send it back, I'd like to add a personal message.
I'm gay. Marlena Nichols is my girlfriend.
so, pizza-boy mugger, you can forget about collecting from me
well, it looks like Kylee won't be needing my help anymore
that totally rocks.
dude, why are lesbians, like, so pissed off all the time?
let your fre flag fly, ladies!
how progressive of you, Dick
damn. What is it with you?
do you follow me around me for fun, or what?
would it help if I started making out with my girlfriend in the hall
Yeah. Obviously
but look, I'll fix your car whatever you gatta learn to leave me alone and here I thought we were getting to be pals
please. You date Logan, He's nailed for murder.
you date Duncan. He's wanted for kidnapping
you get put on robbie and hunter's jury, they get sent to chino
you're like rich-dude kryptonite, Veronica
this rich dude wants no part of it
Hey, Carmen.
heard from our favorite videographer lately?
he called over Christmas to try to apologize for that whole popsicle thing
like people even remember my scandal anymore
pleasuring inanimate objects was so 2005
Yeah, this year's all about pulling kids out of the closet
so I have a feeling we're not just catching up here
any idea why the pizza mugger used your name?
no
you mind looking at something?
obviously you, John Ramos, and Amy are all students
you live relatively close but is there anything else that would tie you together in the mugger's mind?
we're all coconuts
that's what you get called in Neptune when you're latino and date white people or join honor society.
get it? Like twinkies and oreos except we're brown on the outside and
I get it. I...I'm sorry.
Hey, you didn't make the rules
I hope you get your bad guy, Veronica
Atually, you could help
can you make me a list of everyone you can think of who gets made fun of
you know... ...being a coconut?
sorry about your car, Kelly
Yeah. Thanks
did you get a look at the guy who zapped you?
no. Nothing. I was getting in my car at sac-n-pac
next thing I knew, I was waking up and my car was up on blocks
you must have been out a long time
I can't believe no one called the cops
how long would it take to get the rims off a car?
how should I know?
I mean, did they bring their own jack, or...
look, I already told all this stuff to the cops.
why do I need to say it again to you?
you gonna let me in?
well, I'm trying to act like I don't know you, but...
I don't know how you do it. You've got some serious skill.
it's more of an innate ability to compartmentalize
look, I feel like I'm waiting for a tip or something
can you let me in?
my first girlfriend was murdered nearly got shotgunned by a P. C.H. Er drive-by
color me crazy, but I see a pattern
I'm trying to protect you
so when did your folks split up?
mm, just a year ago
they tell you why?
the official answer -- they grew apart
unofficially, I kept hearing them scream at each other about money
Hannah? Hi, dad
this is Logan.
hello
and there's the Griffith charm. Sorry
that's about the most you'll get out of dad
what are you doing with my daughter?
you want the complete play-by-play?
that's kind of twisted
I want you to get out of my house and never speak to her again
you really want that to happen?
you better rethink what you saw on the bridge
scratch that. What the fitzpatricks told you you saw
you can't threaten me, you little punk
I wouldn't be here if you couldn't be threatened
you want to explain to Hannah why you're really here, try and bully me?
well, why don't you tell her?
sounds like you guys are already so close
I'm sure she'll see things your way
please don't do this
while you're at it, try explaining why you never mentioned how you're the mystery witness in mmurder case
that'll be good. Hmm
guess that never came up on your drive home from the carnival
I'm thinking we're done here
I don't want to keep Hannah waiting
you're joking. Terrence Cook wants another favor
frankly, I'm not sure he wants to owe me any more than he already does
well, he thinks you might have security footage of him from september 13 of last year, the day of the bus crash
and what's he paying you, Mr. Mars?
$400 a day.
that's $400 a day he should be paying me
Terrence Cook's gonna get charged with murder any day now
Terrence Cook owes me a significant amount of money
that's where my interest in him begins and ends
they can swing him from the rafters for all I care
maybe all that swinging will drop some change from his pockets
it might be a little hard to get paid by an incarcerated man
Reggie... check the tapes.
see what you come up with
do you like to gamble, Mr. Mars?
perhaps I could interest you in a line of credit
no, thanks
good man here's a couple of bucks on the house, then
have some fun while you're waiting.
see? Wasn't this better than champagne and ocean views?
until tomorrow
I need to talk to you, Hannah
it's two bucks, buddy
and king makes 22
Oh, man, Cho's is going off tonight
that's what happens when the chains stop delivering to south Neptune
Yeah. No problem
can I get your name and number, please? Mm-hmm
jorge Zideo is a ringer
his name's on Carmen's list
so are you ready to be the bait, Corny?
hell, yeah. No one's better. I'm what you'd call the "master bait.
there you go. Straight off the surveillance hard drive
there's five minutes missing
maybe he was in the john or the elevator. I don't know
that Terrence Cook is a mighty slippery fellow
I need a picture of him at exactly 7: 03
these aren't going to help
you got to take it outside
your cellphone
we jam all the signals in a 100-yard radius
card cheaters. You know
Thanks. Sure
tell -- tell him to chill
lose the mask. Down, boy
what's your name, kid?
do you want to deal with me, or do you want to deal with Mr. Chompers?
Arturo. Who are you working with, Arturo?
I'm not working with no one
you're telling me you took down a varsity jock, jacked his car stole his rims all by your scrawny self?
no. That wasn't me. The others was
no, I heard about. I figured I had me my own copycat
cool, huh?
give me a break, man. You're some punk freshman
now give me back my tunes before I kick your ass
just wait till I'm a P. C.H. Er, shaggy
then I'm gonna find your ass, and you're gonna get yours
thumper telling you to rob pizza boys?
no, I'm proving myself so he'll let me in.
P. C.H. Is back in charge, lady
did you just call me "lady"?
okay.
so the blackmailing --is that another way you're out proving yourself, cholito?
man, what are you talking about?
Black-whatting?
thanks for your cooperation
looks like we're done here, Arturo
cool. Can I go home, then?
almost.
I need you to get me into a restricted website
sure, what's the address?
I don't know
what's it for?
it's a Neptune High gay chat room
Veronica, you're not... no, I'm just curious
curious as to what's posted on the website, more accurately
here we go work your funky magic
and nothing. What's the problem?
you set it up, didn't you?
some ass-face got onto their message board and wrote some pretty awful stuff so Ryan asked me to beef up their security
Yeah, I work for Ryan, too now so if you could just so then why wouldn't he have let you on it himself
damn you and your valid questions
look, it's still private if i only see the usernames, right?
savvy detectives such as yourself might deduce through the pirate's S. H.I. P.Ers are
mac, the only way I can stop the Marlenas and Kylees of this school from being tormented is if I get on that message board
all right, stop it. You're embarrassing me
okay, I'll make you a hard copy but you ha to burn it when you're done
excuse me, coach?
think I could ride with the team tonight?
my car's in the shop, and I promised your star point guard I'd be there
did I mention all the action shots I'll take for the Navigator?
I'm sorry, Veronica, we have a strict rule against girls on the team bus
I want them focused
you can ride with me if you want
I realize it's no bus filled with rowdy towel-snapping jocks but it'll smell better
I don't know. Um...
do you have room for my giant foam finger?
I do, and I can even drop you off around the block if you're worried about being seen together
Yes. Please, by all means, protect my reputation
don't blame Mac. I made her print it out
I don't care who's gay
that's fine. I just didn't want to let you onto the site myself
I've let those guys down enough
Ryan, we caught the mugger
he doesn't have the cranial resources to spell blackmail let alone perform it the list getting out isn't your fault. It never was
I think the blackmailer is one of your own posters
what? You're serious?
I was looking through some old chats
um, here. Back in July, this guy who calls himself "Mizz P.
went off about "the outing of all outings in Neptune,
and then he vanished
a tad ominous, don't you think?
mizz P. Ain't the bad guy, Veronica
his name was Peter Ferraire, and...
he died in the bus crash -Oh, I'm -- -and there's been another blackmailing letter
who are they after now?
Oh, you can't be serious?
I told the victim they could come to you for help, but...
I wouldn't hold your breath on this one
great. I'll just head out into the hall and look for the guy in the black hat twirling his moustache
what are you doing?
that depends what are you gonna let me do?
look... I know you stabbed that kid on the bridge
my dad told me everything
no, your dad is a liar. I didn't kill anyone, Hannah
your dad wasn't even there
I was worried you were embarrassed of me, and you were just using me
when I met you at the carnival had no idea who you were, I swear
look, the reason your parents were fighting about money all the time
it's because your dad was blowing it on coke
my dad's a cokehead?
please, he's a doctor, Logan
and that's why a jury's gonna buy it when he tells them I killed Felix
your dad is in deep to the fitzpatrick family the ones who really wanted Felix dead
and I'm supposed to believe you
you do believe me
what I'm saying makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
let me go, Logan, please.
Yeah. Just think about it
check around the house. Keep an open mind
I found our silver bullet, Terrence
you couldn't have made the call that blew up the bus
surveillance shots.
Ta-da!
no cell signal anywhere in the Seven Wivers casino
what you got is proof that I was in a private meeting with Leonard Lobo
you were in a legal gambling venue placing legal bets
lobo's name is on the league unsavory-characters list
he was suspected of, but never convicted of fixing a college basketball game back in the '80s
if I admit that I was in his office
I make myself the next Pete Rose
we'll take these photos to the sheriff and I'll make sure they don't get out
all you need is a little leverage
it's my brother's car
brother's plates
whereas your personalized plates might read...
you didn't get mugged, did you?
no
you needed to make some fast cash, isn't that right?
yes
you're gay, aren't you?
what do you want from me?
I want to know why you act like you do
the other day when you and your pal were making fun of Dick
when underneath I was really just bashing myself
very insightful. Want to know why I do it?
because I want to survive high school, okay?
so you hock your own rims for cash to pay the blackmailer use the pizza-boy muggings as a cover then buy new rims with the insurance money
sounds bad when you say it. Veronica...
you realize people here find out I'm queer...
and I'm dead
I'm not out to out you
I just want to pay the damn money and be done with this whole nightmare
the note --let me look at it
it was just an e-mail from some guy named Rck Santorum
he says he wants me to just mail it to him
he gave a local address
he gave you an address?
Rick santorum's address is a fake
no surprise there
Kelly mailed his blackmail payoff, but it's been stalled at the post office
it's been like waiting for a toaster to pop these past seven hours
well, I'll watch it if you don't have the time
I'll call you if I see anything
no need.
it finally moved
let's see where the package ended up
hubbell Street. I know who lives there
Hey, blackmailer.
I figured I'd be seeing you sometime today
looking for this?
most people just get pissed and smash it into a million pieces but they're kind of expensive, so thanks
and I thought I was being so clever with the whole dead-letter-office thing
pretty clever
you knew the money would make its way to the post office
how'd you ever get in to retrieve the package?
my mom works there
Ooh, nice
so I'm assuming Kelly wants his money back
safe assumption
why'd you do it?
I wanted to get out of Neptune after graduation
there goes that plan
community college, here I come
besides, I didn't care much about self-hating "kissnkuzn.
I would have slept just fine knowing that Kelly Kuzzio was driving around rimless
why'd you out Marlena?
cause I'm a horrible, crazy bitch
you want to know what's worse?
I told her the blackmailer was bluffing
I told her not to pay
I don't get it
I wanted to be out, but I wanted Marlena out with me
I wanted to be able to walk down the halls with her like a real couple
so she didn't want to come out, and you did?
something like that
I want to tell Marlena myself, if that's okay
OK you were right about my dad who's that?
Hannah something, I think
I'd be a willowy blonde, too, if my dad was a plastic surgeon
wait a minute. This isn't the way to the regional finals
if my dad expects me to drive 75 miles in this bouncy, old bronco then he really is a murderer
okay, which one is Monday?
you laugh, but he pretty much used to have one for every day of the month
our lives are so similar
the Mars family hangar is a spitting image of this one
flying's not his thing
woody Goodman lets dad use the hangar for his toys
so... what are you in the mood for?
hot-blooded italian or cool and teutonic?
how about privileged and upper-crusty?
I want you to announce that Terrence Cook has been cleared of suspicion in the bus crash
what? This some kind of Jedi mind trick?
why would I want to do that?
exactly what am I supposed to be looking at?
his alibi
you caught Terrence at a casino, huh?
there's a surprise
those time stamps say that he was at the Seven Rivers casino at the time of the explosion.
at 7: 01 and 7: 06
could have been off and made a call between then
the casino blocks cell reception
pay phones
you really think someone would make a phone call on a land line that would kill a bus full of people from a location that has 4, 000 cameras and 300 security personnel?
subpoena the phone records, check the calls
Ugh, sounds like a lot of work
what's your beef with me, sheriff?
my beef?
I suppose it's that you killed a busload of kids just to tidy up your love life
crazy girlfriend who knew about you betting on baseball
that's a liability you could not afford
I suggest you go home and enjoy your last few days of freedom
you're not gonna press charges, Lb
whatever you say, boss
what's this?
play it really hope this is the new big & rich
I got a guy in a holding cell back there says you did favors for gentlemen who bet extensively on baseball and he wants to make a deal
me, I would much rather deal with you all right what's this? where'd you get it?
I don't think a grand jury will have a hard time figuring it out
you don't back off, sheriff and that recording is going straight to Woody Goodman, newspapers, your grandmama
right
here's how it's gonna play out, slugger
release the tape, I lose my $50k civil-servant job
you -- you lose your hall of fame induction your color-commentating gig, your endorsements
Where's the trade in that, Terrence?
the boy can play ball
did you see his "running teardrop" in the lane?
I saw it. It was jordan-esque
but tomorrow, we both got to promise, say nothing to him
we cannot feed that ego
I like my wallace humble
my dad told me that you're helping out with his case
that means a lot, especially since he's already been convicted by half the people in Neptune
well, luckily, it's the half I don't like, so it works out
this is not good. The top's broken
it's probably just a blown fuse
okay, and you sound like you know how to fix it
well, if she's anything like my Lebaron under the bonnet, I'm gonna need a phillips head
screwdriver
you find it?
dad?
honey, what is it? What's wrong?
Jackie and I borrowed one of Terrence's cars tonight
I was digging around in the hangar where he keeps them, and I found...
I don't know
but I'm pretty sure it was some sort of explosive and detonators
she has attitude with certain teachers.
she falls asleep in class.
I can't see you anymore.
all here? - Yep
all here.
they're all dead!
it just went straight off the cliff!
the bus crash...
it was meant for me.
it's a voice mail from one of the students who died in the crash.
she called just as the bus went over.
Hey, about next weekend...
the bus was sabotaged.
if that sound is an explosion, not only were those kids murdered, but the guilty party is still at large.
good morning, Veronica.
the school counselor would like to see you.
you were sleeping in class.
Mrs. Taft said she's reprimanded you three times for wearing headphones while she was teaching.
she's reading "The Golden Bowl..."aloud...
...with a fake english accent.
you were caught ripping down another student's poster.
am I being followed?
the student who made the poster would like to have her photos back.
something you want to talk about?
Yeah, but Jennifer Love Hewitt might be more qualified.
how's that?
I'm being haunted.
and she's the ghost whisperer.
these are the jokes.
haunted?
Yeah, by the kids who died in the bus crash.
I take it you don't see them?
no, Veronica, I don't. - Good. Neither do I.
except come bedtime the second I close my eyes, there they are...
acting like they're dying to tell me something.
we have Cervando, the academically inclined P. C.H. Er...
BETINA, Dick Casablancas' booty buddy...
all I know about her so far is that she called her friend Michelle right before the crash.
Oh, Marcos, of "Ahoy, Mateys!" fame...
he had a pirate radio show.
I've been listening to it nonstop, hence the headphones.
and Peter who generously posted the details of his unrequited gay love on neptunepirateship. com.
so now we're like this.
and then there's Meg.
actually, you might be able to help.
what do you know about a janitor named Lucky?
Why?
meg had a lot to say about him.
this is so cool.
Yeah, it's just dreamy.
I really want to spend eternity like a plastic scuba diver in someone's fish tank.
so, Meg, what's with that guy, Lucky?
your parents' friend from church?
can't picture them wanting to set you up with someone.
they weren't outwardly setting us up.
they just kept having him over for dinner so he could talk about his four months in Iraq and how he took a shrapnel in the ass for America.
he'd quote the bible. They'd point out how great he was.
fun, fun, fun.
but you thought he was creepy.
have you been reading my e-mails?
my sister gave my computer files to Duncan, not you.
those are my personal, intimate...
wait.
I forgot.
I'm dead.
in Veronica-land, no pulse, no privacy.
I'm trying to help.
look, my parents think Lucky's a saint because he sings hymns with his eyes closed and he helped my dad move an air conditioner.
he's just a janitor at the high school he graduated from who buys beer for guys like Logan to hang on to his glory days.
but you know all this from my e-mails.
Veronica, when did these dreams start?
a few days ago.
Michelle Thompson set up this booth in the hallway.
she's trying to raise money to buy a yearbook spread for every kid who died in the bus crash.
she's the one you should be talking to.
she has that wide-eyed "Margot Kidder in a bush" look.
total nutjob.
I've already raised $200
and I've only been doing it for a day.
you know, if I raise enough
I might be able to get one of those audio chips like the kind that play "happy birthday" when you open the card.
I know it's a bit much, but...
wouldn't it be great to hear them laughing and happy?
what did Michelle mean about hearing everybody laughing?
her friend Rhonda left a message for her right as she was going off the cliff.
I knew about that one.
that one?
turns out, Rhonda called Michelle's home first, left a message there, too.
when michelle told me about it, she said...
she could hear all the kids laughing on the bus.
so I asked if I could hear it.
I seriously cannot believe you're missing this.
I know you can hear.
Betina. Hey, Betina!
you ready for a little... bow, chicka, wow, wow?
you need to call me.
did you hear your friend Meg?
no, but I heard someone I know.
I'm sorry.
I guess it is upsetting.
more disturbing.
he wasn't on the bus.
you heard Dick Casablancas' voice.
Yep.
even though there's no way he could have been on the bus at the time.
freaky, huh?
did you tell your dad about this?
funny you should ask.
Michelle, why aren't you picking up?
you big loser.
I can't believe you bailed on the field trip without telling me.
about next weekend...
No!
I'm fine.
it was just a bad dream.
did you watch "House of Wax" again?
you know that Hilton girl gives you nightmares.
these are the kids who died on the bus.
maybe this isn't the best bedtime reading.
Betina played these phone messages from Dick for everyone on the bus.
this was in the cd player.
and how did it get here?
I willed it?
you snuck onto the bus?
Yeah, like you didn't?
why didn't you tell me about the drawing?
I didn't see a drawing.
I was on the bus for a minute before security came in.
it was drawn on the back of one of the bus seats.
I am god
because I have the power to put myself and my classmates in individual coffins.
you think the person who drew this is responsible for the crash?
I think it's possible.
the bus was brand-new.
there was no other graffiti.
why nine tombstones?
eight people were killed in the crash.
I guess the artist wasn't expecting me to get off the bus.
can I see the artwork?
Oh, my.
one of the kids who died on the bus drew that.
I need to find out who.
Yep, I have no idea what compelled me to do that.
is it because you're 5?
I'm a little punchy. I haven't been sleeping.
thoughts of me?
Hey, I get it.
sometimes I'm up all night, just thinking about myself.
do you know a guy named Lucky?
he's one of the night janitors here.
Tommy Dominick? Yeah.
why "Lucky"?
well, he graduates, and his parents file chapter 11.
he has to drop out of college.
he signs up for army rangers.
he gets sent to iraq. And four months in he gets shot.
and that makes him lucky?
Hey, they shot him in the butt. It could be worse.
you met him, too, you know.
remember?
Hey, Logan.
is there a point to this story?
will you let me finish?
Sheesh.
Oh, good. We have an audience.
okay, lover boy, that's enough face-sucking for now.
we have things to do.
you're on a tight schedule of smoking pot and playing "Halo."
I can't wait to graduate.
come on, man.
we're done screwing around.
the ball's in our court. Someone's got to pay.
but after we make someone pay, we're gonna get high and play "Halo," right?
get it together, Dick.
90 seconds.
wrap this up.
I'll be there when I'm there.
remind me... why did we break up?
you thought the other guy had greener grass.
or was it something about me being too much man?
no, wait!
it was you. You were too much man.
Hey! Hey!
as I was saying, each team will design a device to protect an egg dropped from increasing heights.
the pair whose egg survives the highest drop will earn an "A
plus the team will be excused from mr. Wu's notorious, GPA-killin'...
...final exam.
Mr. Wu must really like his egg-drop soup.
uh, does this assignment come with pot sticker?
students!
this experiment is a major test grade.
for some of you it means passing this class or not.
dude, is Mr. Wu hitting on me?
okay, people, that does it.
I'm assigning your partners alphabetically.
Dick, it's bad idea for you and Mr. Echolls to be working together.
so bad it's good?
no.
God, I don't know how I'm gonna quit you.
Shh!
it's not me. It's Wu.
Dick Casablancas, your new partner's Angie Dahl.
score!
Logan Echolls, you'll join Wallace Fennell.
gentleman Dick at your service.
foot massage? Coconut-oil rubdown?
just stay out of my way.
I need to be excused from the final exam.
gonna get all superachiever on me, are you?
I'm just trying to avoid flunking.
Hearst will yank my scholarship.
excellent. The bar is so low, we can step over it.
just because you wiggle your finger doesn't mean Dick's gonna come.
I know who you did last summer
Veronica Minx, what are you up to?
Oh, you know, this, that, the other.
you ready for a little... bow, chicka, wow, wow? Betina!
pick up, pick up, pick up
you little frickin' hottie.
tell me about you and Betina.
who?
uh, wait. What?
everybody has their secret shame,"V.
you get tanked at the wrong party, stumble a couple rungsdown the food chain.
you know how it is. You dated that cop.
patience dwindling.
sometimes you don't need the prettiest horse, just one that lets you ride bareback.
ever think maybe...
that was a little, I don't know, dangerous?
what am I, stupid?
she was on the pill.
I don't why you're in a bunch. I don't hear her complaining.
you know she's dead, right?
and she did complain.
she played your messages for the whole bus on the way home from shark field.
that's not a satisfied customer, Dick, that's a woman scorned.
well, she had nothing to be scorned about.
I even gave her a little gift that day...
a sharks premium ticket package my sharks memorabilia gift bag.
the tickets they raffled off?
you didn't win the tickets.
I saw that gay kid who won them toss them in the trash, and I thought Betina might like them.
or she could sell them for grocery money or whatever.
Pissed-off, white-trash booty buddy, free tickets.
it's a no-brainer.
dad? Dad?
Maureen? Hi. I'm Veronica.
I'm helping michelle with the yearbook tribute.
I already gave her all the good pictures of Betina.
I know. We were just wondering if you had any poems or artwork, something of Betina's that was more personal?
nothing she'd want in the yearbook.
is there someone else I should ask, another friend, a boyfriend?
she didn't have a boyfriend.
Oh.
I thought I saw her at a party once with Dick Casablancas.
Dick Casablancas is the bastard child of Satan.
well, that would explain a lot.
I don't know what you heard, but he was horrible to Betina.
he treated her like a free hooker.
I know, she let him.
but it's my friendial obligation to blame it all on him.
I know Dick.
blame him.
Betina just lost her mind over him.
the worse he treated her the more she lapped up after him.
he was her ideal guy...
rich and completely indifferent to her.
the joke so would have been on him.
what do you mean?
all he wanted was to mess around with her and have no one know.
and all she wanted was for him to knock her up so she could shout it from the rooftops.
what's with the t-shirts?
you need help keeping us straight in your head?
straight?
queer eye for the dead guy" has Petey wearing a rhinestone fricking rainbow!
seriously, ever heard of Butch?
I have important information.
don't we all?
it's time for the bus to crash.
and here it comes... Imitation crab.
the winner of this week's "Cock Of The Walk" countdown...
don't leave them hanging, captain.
...is Logan Echolls.
that's 40 weeks running.
ROSEMARY'S baby... the teen years.
if at four feet, it survives, we pass.
here goes nothing.
mazel Tov.
two passing grades, over easy.
I guess our work here is through.
Ah.
my buffalo burger has arrived.
thank you.
must be nice.
not for the buffalo.
you don't like me much, do you?
the last time we actually talked, you were bashing Veronica's headlights with a crowbar.
Oh, foreplay.
good evening. -Wallace, have you met my fluffer?
did I see you at school today?
I don't know. Were you hallucinating?
you were dressed in that exact snazzy outfit, which, if I'm not mistaken, is your dating uniform.
is there some miss James rekindling I should know about?
you've got mail from Stanford University.
it's a little anorexic for an acceptance letter.
good news or bad, you know I'm proud of you.
dear Ms. Mars, it is with great pleasure that the admissions board at stanford university welcomes you to our institution.
you did it, baby.
Veronica, Angie, thank you for coming in.
it turns out there's been an error in the calculations regarding the class rankings.
it seems to only affect the two of you, who remain in the running for the Kane scholarship.
an error? What...
what kind of error?
Angie was awarded an "A" for the summer-at-sea elective she took.
it was a college-level course.
so rather than a 4-point "A,"
Angie should have been awarded a 5-point "A."
the adjusted grades have pushed Angie ahead of you.
you could have taken the class.
it was open to anyone -Yeah?
how much did that semester-at-sea class set you back?
how should I know?
Veronica, I know Angie Dahl.
and I don't think she's the witch you're painting her as.
she's a demon spawn.
story of my life.
I get five minutes of thinking my dreams may come true, and then some rich kid slaps reality back into me.
so, how was last night? Any bad dreams?
if I say no, do I have to keep coming back here?
I'm still nonstop "Nightmare on Elm street."
and I haven't been able to figure out who drew the picture.
there is one silver lining.
my dad seems...
happy.
well, that's wonderful, Veronica.
I'm very happy for him.
I'm glad you are in touch again.
uh, we're not.
there's nothing about you that says second place.
nothing but my GPA.
Angie Dahl's parents convinced the school board that the grades she purchased should be worth more than the ones I earned.
Oh, you need to shake this off.
just work through it.
the lowest point of the ebb is the turn of the tide.
don't quote.
sorry.
I'm having a Mexican standoff with the sandman.
he's winning.
when I die, I want you to raise money for my spread in vibe.
Oh, didn't I e-mail you? You're never allowed to die.
would you look at that?
the most innocent-looking picture is the girl who was hell on wheels.
Rhonda and her sister Natalie were in Clemmons' office all the time, always in trouble for huffing paint, stealing, fighting.
anything to reinforce the PWT stereotype.
there's a "Pretty Young Thing" stereotype?
do I fit it?
PWT...
poor White Trash.
Oh, them.
so, can you point Rhonda's sister out to me after school?
what else am I gonna do?
first name basis" is so much better than "it's just coffee."
believe me. I've tried all the services.
I like that I don't have to send out a picture.
I like not giving out my real name.
I mean,
I sure wasn't disappointed when I saw you wander up.
you weren't disappointed when you saw me, were you?
I wasn't.
I didn't think so.
in fact,
I thought I saw a smile. Am I right?
your mother has sent you something.
apparently it's more important than my class.
Logan, you and Wallace are up.
I could rub your head for luck.
you could try.
I'm in. I got into Stanford.
all right!
you can be roomies with Veronica Mars.
there's a pillow fight I'd like to see.
Veronica Mars got into Stanford?
Yeah, Veronica Mars.
Stanford.
well, I guess somebody has to do the football team.
you've got what all cruising seniors desire...
a passing grade.
if you'd like to aim higher tomorrow,
I won't hold my breath.
I heard in dorms all the girls shower together.
maybe you and Ronnie can soap each other's backs.
Mr. Wu?
I want another partner.
Dick is being inappropriate and didn't help with our project.
dude, I totally helped.
can you pick up your project, bring it to me?
I'll see you in summer school, Dick.
what?
believe me, I'm no happier than you.
Congratulations.
you've single-handedly fulfilled the stanford bitch quota.
enjoy trade school, Logan.
if you don't mind,
I'm gonna keep working on the project.
come by later. I'm in.
what's time to a hog?
all right I think that's Rhonda's sister.
are you sure there's a "P" before that "WT"?
that's definitely her.
she's driving a 'vette now.
last year she offered to make out with me for cigarette money.
Hey, is this your car?
no, it's my roller skate.
this is so cool.
I was thinking about moving up to a sweeter ride myself.
how does she handle?
better than the bus.
you can take the girl out of the trash, but you can't take the trash out of the girl.
Oh, the time and effort she saved me.
why aren't you learning something?
and a good day to you, too, sir.
I was thinking about some great advice you gave me.
look both ways?
don't stick that in your nose?
follow the money.
could you run the financial records of the families with kids who died in the crash?
will do. Got to go. Important meeting.
you know who you remind me of?
that guy on "Seinfeld," George.
Oh, how so?
well, he's a nice guy, like you.
but there's so much unrealized potential.
a guy who really wants to meet women goes for it.
you know, he dresses to impress, a little cologne, a gym membership.
you... -...should make more of an effort?
my ex-husband went for a hair transplant.
he looked fantastic afterwards.
cologne, new suit, hair.
I should probably write this stuff down.
we magnify the drag, decrease the velocity, minimize the force, and decelerate...
decelerate yourself.
four is officially your espresso limit.
so, I know why I'm trying to help out Veronica.
I want her to get to go to Stanford.
why are you doing it?
I don't know, not for Veronica.
then what?
the spirit of competition.
Yeah.
all right.
why don't you chill while the glue dries?
I got to see a man about a horse.
...Look at the hurdles GM is trying to...
Tonight,"The Tinseltown Diaries" examines the rise and fall of one of hollywood's brightest stars.

who is the real Aaron Echolls?
wife Lynn's car was found stranded on the Coronado bridge, where she is assumed to have leapt to her death.
but it was his son's murdered girlfriend who would actually come back to haunt Aaron.
rumors of Echolls sometimes...
they rerun it twice a day.
I hear it's a top-rated episode.
and son Logan's rocky relationship with the media and the law began last year when he organized and videotaped a series of...
got something for me?
the love in my heart, chili on the stove, oh, and I ran those financial records.
I'm a great father. -Mm-hmm.
none of the families of the crash victims made money on insurance.
they basically got enough just to pay for the funerals.
however, Rhonda's family won a separate lawsuit with a $2 million payout.
you'll never guess who from.
you're right.
I won't.
woody's burgers paid Rhonda's family a secret $2 million payout.
apparently her mom found a finger in her ribwich.
sometimes opportunity doesn't knock.
it waits for everyone to go to lunch and sneaks in using a key.
it's a long shot that my dead classmates will have something helpful in their permanent files, like being suspended for drawing on school property.
sorry about the inconvenience.
it's one of my bad habits.
and Veronica won't let me buy nice sunglasses anymore because I'll lose them within the week.
making any headway in the case? -Slowly.
we've had three more cases diagnosed just this week of generalized anxiety disorder.
you'd think it was contagious.
and all these students are section 1123 now, all of them coming from the same doctor?
Yep. My faculty is about to revolt.
they're supposed to offer these students deadline extensions, makeup dates on exams, and unlimited time on tests, all at these students' own discretion.
I hope to have something you can use very soon.
my coat?
right. It's in the closet.
Yep.
that's mine, all right.
I was one of those people saying, "Keith Mars should be run out of town,
going after that sweet Jake Kane, making our nice little town look like Bozoville.
and then when I found out what really happened,
I was so embarrassed.
I confess I never vote in the local elections, but I went out this year just so I could vote for you.
I totally carried the pity vote.
but enough about me.
tell me about you.
Oh, it's dull. Trust me.
I'm the office manager for a local doctor.
Really?
I'd love to hear about it.
Peter, as I have learned from his postings, had in his words "yellow fever" and was extremely hot for a certain teacher.
there was one incident in Peter's permanent file.
it didn't say what happened, only that it involved mr. Wu.
can't help but wonder if teacher decided to take a pet.
Hello, Veronica.
would you like to donate to the yearbook tribute for the kids on the bus?
of course. I've been meaning to.
I figured.
Peter was a friend of mine.
I know you two had a connection.
I'm sorry for your loss. You must miss him.
do you miss him?
as a bright and dedicated student, yes.
in the way I think you're implying, no.
Peter was gearing up for what he called the "outing of all outings."
I was wondering if he was pulling his favorite teacher out of the closet.
Veronica, I think when you get out in the world a little more, you'll discover that not all well-dressed, articulate, detail-oriented men are gay.
many of them are just asian.
so, you knew Peter had feelings for you?
Yes, I did.
he confessed these feelings to me on the unfortunate night we ran into each other at possibilities.
why were you at a gay bar?
not that I need to explain myself to you, Veronica, but it was a cousin's birthday party.
I was being supportive.
I explained the situation to Mr. Clemmons.
I believe he has it all on file.
sorry. You're right. None of my business.
did Peter have any hobbies like drawing or painting?
I thought he was your friend.
so, do you believe him?
Mr. Wuuu!
Yes.
and I hate to disappoint you, but even if he were gay,
I don't think it would qualify as the "outing of all outings."
you think you know me because you read my postings?
every line of your postings like 80 times.
I know you like the back of my...
what's wrong? -Nothing.
you're asking the wrong question.
all right, maybe a better question...
is why was I even on the bus?
why would I even be interested in going to a baseball stadium?
huh?
mull that one over for a while, okay?
one P. C.H. Er died on the bus crash, Cervando Luna.
grade-point average... 3. 8
average trips to the principal's office per week... 3. 2, including a visit during summer school for pushing Cassidy Casablancas against a wall and threatening him.
busy Beaver, always working.
what's up, Veronica?
during summer school, you had a run-in with a kid named Cervando?
he ran me into a wall, if that's what you mean.
I'd dunk the eight ball a couple of times, jack up my fingers like I don't know how to hold the cue.
I see Liam all winking at his cousin, thinking he's got one.
every time I made a shot, I'd be all excited, then act all scared like I was worried that he'd do something.
check this out.
courtesy of Liam Fitzpatrick being a sucker...
$200 jeans. Look at these things. I'm never taking them off.
boom, boom, boom.
yo, man, you crazy? -Get out of here, Dick.
Cervando, you know, he's normally a pretty cool guy for a P. C.H. Er, but
but the next day, that dude, he was seriously on the warpath.
Dick's squirt gun was loaded with bleach.
you owe me a pair of jeans.
W-what are you talking about?
size, style, color.
but I didn't do anything. It was Dick.
well, I'm not telling him. I'm telling you.
gentlemen, that's quite enough.
Cervando, come with me.
I guess Dick was too big for him.
so he figured he'd settle the score with his little brother.
story of my life.
what's this?
it's a tape of Dr. Burns' office manager offering to hook Veronica up with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder for a $1, 000 consultation fee.
how did you get this?
painfully.
you got to kiss a lot of toads before you find your medical office manager.
okay, folks,
Angie Dahl is our only student to survive the 12-foot drop.
Mr. Fennell, Mr. Echolls, you're our last remaining team still in the running for an exemption from Mr. Wu's notorious GPA-killing final exam, as well as the accompanying hardware.
do it! Yeah!
do it!
scramble.
that's awesome about the egg drop.
you ready for miss Murphy's "Crime and Punishment" exam?
Nope. I was up all night working on my egg thing.
I'm requesting an extension because of my generalized anxiety disorder.
ahoy, Mateys! 540 on your A. M. Dial. Listen...
Oh, am I still keeping you up at night?
you look like Steve Buscemi.
you...are such...
a catch.
how has Hannah been able to keep away?
maybe you should cut him some slack sometimes.
attention, faculty and students.
I have an important announcement to make regarding school policy.
due to some recently discovered abuses,
Neptune high will no longer be honoring special exemptions or extensions for section 1123 students.
do you want to solve this problem, or do you want to sleep?
how did you get home the day of the crash?
Weevil?
Hey, don't you think that's weird?
the bomb didn't kill us.
it killed the driver, probably, but it was a long drop off the cliff, and crashing onto the rocks that got the rest of us.
FYI... I made it through that.
I got to drown.
say a person wants to just take out the bus driver.
they could do it here, here, here, basically anywhere along the way.
but to get the whole bus, they'd have to know when it was approaching a cliff.
they'd have to be close enough to see exactly where we were.
Hey, look. He's bald.
you think it was Weevil?
I am god.
what?
I... am... god.
that's our show, pirates and pi-ladies.
you've been listening to "Ahoy, Mateys!" This is Cap'n Krunk...
and imitation crab... Signing off saying...Arr!
so, that's it? The tombstone artwork was just an album cover?
and Rosebud was just a sled.
I didn 't just ruin "Citizen Kane" for you, did I?
no, no.
good.
so, are we done?
well, that depends. Do you think you're through being haunted?
I better be.
I was thinking about the great advice I gave you about following the money.
the money wasn't on the bus.
the rich kids were behind, driving in the limo.
so, maybe whoever crashed the bus was counting on them being on it?
richard Casablancas took an insurance policy out on his sons three days after marrying Kendall.
Dick and Beaver are worth more dead than they are alive.
kind of disappointing, huh?
not a suicide thing. Just a song I liked.
that brings us back to you.
to me?
it was a fun exercise, probably comforting for a while, thinking it's someone else's fault.
but it's not, is it?
we died because of you.
Ooh, what do you think this means, Veronica?
think I got what it takes for art school?
crap
it's for you.
where are you, loser?
=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
wake up!
I've spent the last forty minutes listening to Logan dry-heave so you can buy a deformed pinata?
dude, everything was closed. It was the cheapest souvenir I could find.
I'll say it one more time.
Juanita, from the Hot Tamale: Ay, ay, ay.
whoa, what'd I tell you about drool on the leather? Dad's very strict about the car.
he's the only one allowed to dry-heave in it.
alright.
have we had our fill of Tijuana?
no. - Yes.
no, no thanks. - Senor?
these border checkpoints, man, they always freak me out.
maybe you shouldn't volunteer for the full-cavity search.
morning.
morning, sir.
you, ah, fellas have a good time in Mexico?
Yes, sir.
you wanna go ahead and hand over your contraband?
it works sometimes. Pop the trunk.
anybody else hungry?
sure. - Yeah.
I can't believe you're calling me a wuss. I'm serious. You're the guy that can't close the deal.
dude, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about that girl. That girl, 艾斯梅拉达.
the deal was closed back in VIP, my brother, make no mistake.
no way.
did you wash your hands?
thank you.
I got this, boys, let's roll.
settle something for us, partner.
didn't Luke look scared last night when that senorita started working her milkshakes on him?
that's great. That's adorable, You're a good man, thank you.
I wasn't scared. I was concerned.
Ah, yeah. You never saw a girl take a shot glass like that before.
isn't this where we parked? Tell me that this isn't where we parked.
please, someone tell me that you can see my father's car and this heart attack I'm having now is for nothing.
I don't know. Maybe it's like Brigadoon.
come back in a hundred years and it'll be right back in this spot.
did you lock it?
did I lock it?
what's your problem? It's not even your ass on the line.
yeah I know.
this just...
really sucks, man.
wow, man, that's profound.
my parents come back in five days. If the car's not back before my dad is,
I'll be singing hymns and doing rosary beads faster than you can say The Passion.
dude! Where's your car?
sorry.
Ah, your monkey's gonna have to ride in the back.
nice car.
that must have been a huge cereal box.
now let's let that go. Cherish these moments, because they will probably be the last ones that we spend together.
Hey. I don't mind dating a guy that rides a bike.
how do you feel about dating a guy who's being sent to Catholic school in Albuquerque?
thanks for the ride.
does this mean you're gonna play nice now?
walk in front of the car. We'll see.
can I stay in your guest house? I just don't wanna wake my parents up this early.
I have a brilliant idea. - Does it involve a time machine?
why don't I make some phone calls and see if I can track down the car?
I appreciate it, but I think this is even beyond your superpowers.
haven't you heard? I've got friends in low places.
look, I can't report the car stolen because my Dad thinks it's still safely tucked in the garage.
which means I can't get the anti-theft homing device activated.
it's probably on a cargo ship to Jamaica.
and my dad is going to send me away. Then he's going to track me down and he's going to kill me.
not if he doesn't find out.
let's go back to your house.
and take my mind off my problems?
and get details on the car.
model, license number, VIN...
how do you make VIN sound so hot?
you're going to find Troy's stolen car over the internet?
you'd be surprised what one can find with a few nimble keystrokes.
alright, then, Velma, why don't you see what you can find on, say, me?
it's Daphne, thank you very much.
what's that?
if you're a P. I. with a password, this is the gateway to many-a skeleton-filled closet.
arrests, divorces, bankruptcies.
Rut-roh! Somebody got their license suspended last year!
I got it back. Bet you it doesn't say that!
well, if I'm Daphne, what does that make you? Fred?
Oh, no. If I gotta be one of those white boys, I gotta be Shaggy all the way, baby.
Shaggy's got mad flava.
Aw, you still have a subscription to Mad Magazine?
you're all about the flavor.
Hey, guys. - Hi.
Hey, help me out. So, for my Dad's birthday, I'm thinking... rock climbing?
because he loves heights?
not so much, but keep thinking outside the box. I like it.
and don't wait on me for dinner. I'll probably get take-out from the Italian place.
Luigi's? Will you get me some lasagna?
some lasagna?
I'm just saying, the last time we went to Luigi's, you ate your weight in manacotti.
and now your birthday will be spent skydiving.
alone.
Hi, buddy! Hi. We'll go out in a minute.
Hi, Keith, it's me. I might be a little late for dinner since I came into work
Oh. Wait a minute. I'm sorry, I was gonna call your cell.
Hi, you've reached Rebecca James and the counseling office at Neptune High School. I'm away
you know those people who can predict when change is coming in their life?
I'm not one of them.
change has a way of just walking up and punching me in the face.
I love the effort.
I mean, look at this guy. He's really working. You're pushing through the pain, man.
nobody's kicking sand in your face. You look a little tired there, Tiger, so I'll tell you what.
tell me where my package is and I'll help you lighten that load.
it's in a friend's car. I'll have it for you tomorrow.
okay, I'll tell you what. You got until nine a. m., otherwise I'm gonna hunt you down and the closest thing you're gonna come to playing baseball is me shoving a bat up your ass.
morning, honey. - What'cha doin'?
I figured I'd put the rest of your mom's stuff in storage.
I don't think we need the reminders anymore, you know?
Yeah.
you wanna take a look?
not so much, no.
well, I'm gonna leave it here for now. I've got an eight o'clock.
so, you and Miss James, huh? I wouldn't have pegged that one.
well, we only went out a couple of times. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
so don't. I get it. Companionship. Needs. Yada, yada, yada. It's fine.
I'm sorry you didn't hear about it from me first.
don't sweat it. You know how many things I don't tell you?
I'm kidding.
it's cool. Just next time, could you shoot for an actual teacher?
because this has no potential benefit to my grade point average.
sure you feel okay about this?
Yes.
good.
I like her.
cool.
have a nice day.
peace.
the best way to dull the pain of your best friend's murder is to have your mother abandon you as soon as possible.
it's like hitting your thumb with a hammer, then when it's throbbing so badly you don't think you'll survive, you cut the damn thing off.
when my dad implicated the much beloved Kane family in Lilly's death,
I was willing to stand by him and lose everything else.
mom? Wasn't.
a safety deposit box key?
thanks everybody! Don't forget, interviewing exercise tomorrow.
Hey. You're helping Troy find his dad's car, right?
you're sweating on me.
look, I need your help.
there's kinda more to this car thing than the car.
there was a pinata full of steroids in the backseat.
I did a run for Hank Zigmund. He owns the Zig-Zag Sports Club.
I wanted to get pumped for Varsity baseball. I was pretty much down for whatever.
including shrunken testicles and acne scars. Well, speaking for the women of America: good plan.
wait. What did Troy and Logan know about this?
nothing. I swear.
Yeah, alright. Logan knew, but he wasn't in on it.
it doesn't matter, anyway. I don't help dealers find their lost products.
look, don't think of it like that, alright?
think of it like you're saving my life, okay, the guy is built like a truck!
he will break one of my limbs.
if I were to help you, you would have to return the steroids and get your money back and then return the cash, not the drugs.
Yeah, I'll do whatever.
I'll figure something out. Just lay low.
Hi, may I help you?
Hi. My mom died last year, and I just found this.
all this time, I've been thinking mom bolted because she couldn't handle losing everything.
maybe she just couldn't handle losing me.
looks like they used a 300mm on this one. Not bad. Definitely the work of a pro.
a pro who knew my schedule quite well last year.
judging by my lack on an eight man, twenty-four hour security detail,
I'm guessing Dad hasn't had the pleasure of viewing this little slideshow.
I thought-- - I'm guessing I'm early.
no, it's fine. - Am I? I'm sorry. I guess I'm just anxious.
umm, Veronica, Rebecca wanted to stop by.
and just say hello. Outside of school.
I'm sure this is a little weird for you. So...
well, this is a little weird, but you two dating isn't. Um, I'm fine. No worries.
well I thought-- - And I agree.
that if you had the chance to talk, things would seem a little less awkward.
and are you starting to see the Catch-22 inherent in the plan?
as a matter of fact, I am.
okay, well, um, is there anything I can do that would make things easier for you?
can you get me out of fifth period bio?
so far it's been a whole lotta brick walls, but I talked to my buddy Earl yesterday at the impound yard.
what do I love more? That you have a buddy named Earl or that he works at the impound yard?
I'm guessing both. No sign of the Beemer.
but he can get you a great deal on a Good Times van.
I'll pass that onto my dad when he gets back. Maybe it'll take his mind off of loading his gun.
I dig this song. - Yeah, me too.
here's a thought.
if Tijuana was Logan's idea then stealing the car could've been the master plan.
it was more of a meeting of the minds, if you will.
Ah. So what was on the menu for this night of grand debauchery?
let's see. From eight to nine, we brainstormed on how to overthrow Kim Jong Il.
from nine to ten, we deleted the records of the black voters of Florida.
and after that was all donkey shows.
so the usual? - Pretty much.
anything else?
if you wanna ask something, you just ask.
okay. Did you meet anyone odd, or were you followed? Did you see any suspicious activity?
how about all of the above? Have you ever been to Tijuana?
I'm not looking for DNA samples.
it's just the more information I have about the car, the better chances of you finding it.
I know.
sorry.
so you think they're going to turn the Beacon system on just because you ask sweetly?
well, we've tried everything else.
just watch a master at work, alright? This is what I do.
um, I'm the personal assistant to Lawrence Vandergraff. He's freaking out.
he thinks his device is broken and he wants to run a diagnostic on his BMW.
here's the VIN number.
please tell me you can do this.
pretty please? Cherry on top?
it's not really procedure...
well, can it be our little secret?
I've worked for the guy for two weeks and he already thinks I'm a ditz.
okay then. Super Roger to the rescue.
Roger. What are you doing?
um, a simple diagnostic. This young lady works for
has the car been reported stolen?
Oh, not exactly.
we never activate Beacon unless the car is reported stolen.
Hey, can you pick me up tomorrow?
Yeah. - Good, good.
you better run, you punk bitch!
time for a chat?
well. You'd think if hell froze over, maybe it would be on the news.
I just wanna hear more about the steroids you bought last weekend.
you mean the steroids Luke bought.
wow, you suck at this Nancy Drew stuff. You should get a new hobby.
so you knew he was doing it.
you actually think that I would tell you anything?
I guess we're done here, Officer.
what's up, T?
hey Gorgeous.
that guy bothering you?
what guy?
alright, where is your sister?
I don't think we have one. - Oh, hi! Um...
you didn't give Backup human food, did you? - Oh, no, no! I just found his happy spot, that's all.
so, um, another case of bad timing. Your dad went out for groceries, 'cause I'm making dinner for both of you tonight.
so, uh, how was your day? - Fine. How was yours?
it was excellent, thank you. I know you guys like Italian food, so I am making fettucine and for dessert, guess.
no idea. - Waffles and ice cream. That's your favorite, right?
I put this sauce on top of vanilla ice cream...
so, when are we gonna cook for your boy?
we're Mars women. Should we play to our strengths?
and who says there's a new boy?
don't even try that. No, wait a minute. Let me guess. Um...
have we met? - Thank you!
um... Travis Kittlemeyer. - Ooh, I think he'd rather be dating Kenny Houseman.
okay. Then Boris-- - Okay!
it's Duncan Kane.
the waffle's burning.
Oh! Oh, god, I am so sorry! It just slipped out of my hands.
it's alright.
Hey, how's it going in here? - Look at this. I'm a klutz.
Oh, that was ancient anyway. Don't even worry about it.
I really appreciate you doing this, but I actually can't stay for dinner.
Really? - Why not?
I told a friend I'd meet him at the Sac and Pac. It's a school project.
Oh. Well, I'll ask first next time. Make sure you're available.
thanks for cooking. I'll try the pasta when I get home.
which won't be too late.
have a good night.
angel. How's business?
this is Veronica. She's the girl that got me out of juvie. I told you about her.
look, she's looking for a car. A green BMW 740i.
should've come through here a couple days ago.
ya, I hear you.
alright.
did you ask him about the pinata?
Oh yeah, one more thing. Uh, did you happen to see a pinata?
so, the car-- - Was chopped.
your uncle won't say for who, but the papers are in order. Blah, blah, blah.
please tell me you know where Mario lives, because we need to get that pinata right away.
baby, I'll buy you a pinata.
will you buy me a pinata full of steroids?
I've only been here once.
uh, maybe that one. Where the balloons are.
Yeah, this has to be it.
stop! Stop!
sorry. Sorry.
am in trouble? What? God! - We need to talk.
alright. But does it have to be next to the feminine hygiene machine?
get over it. Look, I found the pinata and it is not full of steroids.
you're out of options. If you want Ziggy off your back, you're gonna have to buy him off.
Veronica, you don't understand. If I go to him without any steroids, cash or no cash, he's gonna hurt me. Bad.
well. You let me worry about that. You worry about getting the money.
Yeah, how? You think I've got eight grand stashed away in my other wallet?
figure it out!
mom, what are you doing here? Where are we going?
I just thought it would be nice to spend some time together. I thought we could go visit Aunt Sheryl.
in Palm Springs? Mom, I can't go to Palm Springs.
I have a history test next period and a Spanish project due.
honey, please. Don't make this hard. Just come with me, okay?
three days later, she was gone.
at the time, I thought it was just one more on the growing list of odd things my mom was doing.
I chalked her nerves up to the vodka.
but now I think she really was scared.
people rarely cut all their ties, even when they try.
if she's out there and these untraceable, disposable cell phones
I'm sending to Mom's closest friends and family reach her, maybe she'll realize it's safe for her to call me.
it's my version of a message in a bottle.
one more hour and this might actually constitute a walk of shame.
let's say I'm gonna play the dad card and go to bed.
that alright?
actually, I need your help.
what's up?
Troy got his dad's car stolen on his way back from Tijuana, and we're trying to find it before his dad gets back so he's not shipped off to boarding school in Albuquerque.
he's important to you, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
and I need you to do some of that voodoo that you do so well.
I'll be nice to your boyfriend if you be nice to my girlfriend.
deal.
good morning.
good night.
can I help you? - James Anderson, head of security for L. T. Vandergraff.
sorry, I'm not sure I-- - Do you know who Mr. Vandergraff is?
you will when you're named in the lawsuit he'll file against your employer.
now I know you value him as a client.
he really values this car, so we need to run a drill.
you look like a smart lady, do yourself a favor and turn his system on now.
this is insane.
I mean, two thousand bucks with four bids?
these people have no idea what a Barry Bonds ball's worth.
no, it's classic bidding strategy. They'll wait 'til the end of the auction.
try hitting refresh.
classic bidding.
see, there you go. $2800, we're almost there.
no, we're not almost there!
I can't do this. I mean, you have no idea what I went through to get this ball.
you have no idea what it's going to be worth when he retires.
Luke. A ball, or your life.
you do the math.
it's a ball! - Yeah.
what are you doing after school?
wanna come over and play detective?
how are you so laid-back about all this?
I mean, if we don't find this car, we're done.
this? Over.
does that not scare you?
Yes, it does. It's scares the hell out of me.
then why do you seem so
let's just say that you've been told you have seventy-two hours to live.
how do you spend them?
you can dig through medical texts looking for a miracle cure, or you can make those seventy-two hours the best three days of your life.
and I choose sexy fun time.
well, I choose a miracle cure.
I don't get something.
why are your parents sending you off to prison school in Albequerque?
seriously. What's wrong with a good old-fashioned grounding?
I'll get them to call you. Get some parenting advice.
happy to help.
remember, start with light, easy questions first. Let your subject get comfortable.
so, Ms. Mars. How do you respond to the rumors that your boyfriend hooked up with strippers in Tijuana last weekend?
ms. Banks. Have you decided which parent you're going to live with after the divorce?
and if I may, a follow up: can you believe your father's choice in mistresses?
Veronica, I need to speak with you after class, please.
you look ready for a fight.
I get that a lot. I guess it's just my usual expression.
how do you think Ashley's going to sleep tonight?
I didn't tell her anything she didn't already know, deep down.
maybe.
but sometimes the lies we let ourselves believe are for our own good.
you coming?
in a minute. Research.
poor Ms. Dent. She can't see the big picture yet.
love is an investment. Information is insurance.
with someone who's heart has already been crushed, I say you can't be too careful.
Hey, there you are.
I wanted to ask you a favor.
I know you got something planned for my birthday, but I was hoping it would be fine if, you know, before we went to do whatever you got cooked up that we go to Rebecca's house and have her cook us dinner because she's a great cook.
I think you should look at that.
did you know she was still married? - I did.
I'm still married, Veronica.
and that she was arrested for passing bad checks?
when she was twenty-one.
what were you thinking, Veronica? I'm your father.
what made you think you had the right to do something like this?
what are you talking about, have the right? This--this is what we do.
this is how we survive.
I was trying to protect you.
protect me?
I'm an adult, Veronica!
you have let her into our life like it's no big deal!
Oh, it's a big deal! It's a huge deal.
makes me feel good about myself, wanted in a way that I haven't in a long time, and it makes me wake up with a smile on my face. And we didn't ignore your feelings.
we tried to make you feel comfortable, but you chose to be snotty!
mom is still out there somewhere!
do you even care if she ever comes back?
you didn't care until I started dating! You've been hard on your mom for months!
you can find anybody!
if she were a criminal, you'd make a couple grand tracking her down and you'd have her back in a week!
well, maybe I don't care to find her. Have you ever considered that?
and here.
I've turned your boyfriend's security system on.
there's the code.
you sure you're alright?
would you stop asking me that? I need to concentrate.
the signal is weaving all over the place. It's weird.
you think they know that we're onto them.
maybe, but it looks like it's going in between buildings. I don't get it.
it says this is the street.
seems like an unlikely place to hide a stolen car, here in mansion-land.
you think it's in a garage?
no, the signal's still moving all around. It's right on top of us.
please tell me that that dog is not supposed to be the BMW.
think your dad will notice?
Yeah.
you want some breakfast?
no thanks. I'm just gonna grab an apple.
that's for you.
it's everything you may or may not wanna know about Troy.
you can open it, you can throw it out, it's your choice.
I just don't know how to say this.
Keith, just pull the band-aid off.
the furrowed brow and the pauses are killing me.
I can't see you anymore.
okay.
I can't do this to Veronica. She's not ready to see me dating yet. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but she's having a really hard time.
can you do me a favor? - Of course.
can you just tell me it's another reason? Like... like a crappy one?
your being a good father isn't really something I can bitch about to my girlfriends over margaritas.
Hey, Sexy. Give me a kiss? Make all my troubles disappear?
all your troubles? That would take a lot of kissing.
I'm just glad we weren't dating when you were kicked out of those two schools for drug possession and trafficking. My lips would've fallen off.
huh. Well good morning to you, too.
although, back then, Shauna was doing most of the kissing, wasn't she?
you remember Shauna, don't you? You were kicked out of Pembrooke in Connecticut with her for marijuana possession and then out of St. Mary's in Boston. You crazy kids never learn, and yet now I'm supposed to believe that you knew nothing about Luke picking up steroids in T. J.?
what are you talking about, steroids? - Don't even
look, I don't know anything about Luke and steroids.
Yeah, I got busted in Boston with some dope, big deal.
you got busted for drug possession and trafficking!
Yeah. So? That was two years before we even met, what does that have to do with us now?
because you never told me about it!
maybe I would've.
you ever think of that?
maybe after I'd known you for more than a month I'd tell you my deep dark secrets.
or is that too much of a character flaw?
waiting for the girl to like you before you tell her the things you're not so proud of?
I don't have to tell you that. You're Veronica Mars.
you know everything.
I got it all.
eight grand. And a little slice of my soul.
woe is you.
I'll see you again bright and
Hey! - Talk to you later, alright?
is that Hummer downstairs with the Z-MEISTER plates yours?
Abso-damn-lutely.
Wow. Cool, I guessed right.
so, um...
you here to get pumped? - Not exactly.
I'm here to settle Luke's account.
why don't we step in my office? - Oh, that's okay. I'd rather talk out here.
well, I wouldn't. - Well, he would.
you know, darling, unless you're blind, you're gonna have to take your doggy outside.
you can try explaining that to him because he never listens to me.
you don't understand-- - Hold on one sec.
yeah? Oh, hey Wallace.
not much, you?
no, not at all. No.
piece of cake.
Yeah, thanks.
here's the eight grand you fronted Luke. You two are square now.
I'm take the eight grand, but we ain't square, you see.
the little bitch let me down and I'm gonna have to make him pay.
remember this moment. 'Cause you're gonna regret it.
I can do better, I swear, just give me another chance.
you've used up all your chances. You've gotta learn discipline and respect.
dad, please. I'm sorry. I
it's too late for apologies, Troy. You've made your bed.
Yeah.
Wow. That's some cake.
isn't it, though? - I love it.
did you ever notice that everything you make just tends to lean a little to the left?
I do that on purpose.
what time is Rebecca coming? - She's not.
Oh! I already cancelled the birthday surprise...
I was gonna take you to see Santana at the Bowl.
I'm not seeing her anymore.
dad, you don't...
sorry. I obviously know nothing about relationships.
but you can bake and that's important.
it's your birthday. You should be happy.
and what better way to spend it?
no, you should
I should be able to do whatever I want because it's my birthday.
I just wanna have a piece of cake with my daughter. That's all I want.
well, happy birthday, Pop.
Thanks, Kid.
don't forget to make a wish.
good one.
let's keep this between us, alright?
hello. - Hey, baby, it's Shauna.
can you feel the heat yet? I am getting so close, baby, your panties oughta burst into flames any minute now.
Troy, what's with this girl calling me? You gave her my number?
Oh, whoa. What girl?
some girl named Veronica.
you didn't tell her you'd be seeing me soon, did you?
she caught me off guard! What was I supposed to
sorry we didn't get a chance to say goodbye, but just wanted to wish you good luck at your new school and leave you something to remember me by.
it took me a while to figure out where you stashed the steroids, but there was only one place you were alone, right?
in case you're wondering, the former contents of the package are somewhere between my toilet and the Pacific Ocean.
say hi to Shauna for me. She sounds like a keeper.
damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
Mr. Zigmund? You wanna go ahead and turn over your contraband?
step out of the car, please.
Hello, sweetheart. First of all, I miss you so much.
more than you could possibly imagine.
you know what, I did get one of your letters, but I won't tell you which one because I don't want you to try and find me.
Veronica, you listen to me, I know you have a million questions, but everything will make sense when the time is right. I promise.
I'll be in touch soon.
trust me, okay?
I love you.
and could you tell your father I said happy birthday?
I've walked right into the river stix, home base for the fighting Fzpatricks.
I have information about that mexican kid who got killed.
your dad is in deep to the Fitzpatrick family.
toying with a sweet little girl's heart just to screw with her dad?
Jackie and I borrowed one of Terrence's cars tonight.
I was digging around where heeeps them, and I found some sort of explosive.
is that c-4? -You'll have to wait for the press conference.
flat? -Just as god made me.
I'm Troy, by the way.
I'm Veronica.
I'm just glad we weren't dating when you were kicked out of school for drug possession and trafficking.
county supervisor's office?
well read, Dick. You're making great strides.
so, good news
you are no longer writing about the use of mythic archetype in "portrait of the artist as a young man."
all right.
you are all instead entering our mayor, Woody Goodman's, county-wide essay contest on the subject of...freedom.
the winner gets a week's internship as woody's apprentice, which means an opportunity to learn about civic affairs, a plum entry on your college applications, and -- this might interest you, Dick
a chance to stand beside Woody Goodman on tv and push the plunger for the demolition of old shark stadium.
nuke the stadium.
damn. Now I totally wish I could write good.
so, you should be able to write quite an essay on freedom.
how does it feel to have your case dismissed?
freedom feels liberating.
so, you've got your title.
and did Hannah understand why you wouldn't be seeing her anymore?
you didn't tell her, did you?
you owe her an explanation.
what exactly am I supposed to say?
man, you believe it about Logan?
that guy's like a cat.
you mean useless and selfish?
I mean like nine lives.
I just wish I knew how he does it.
that's funny. I do know how he does it, and I wish I didn't.
what you got?
the pamphlet?
from the Hearst packet that we both got, in the envelope that we both got that you didn't open.
Oh, that.
you know the average S. A.T. Score for a Hearst freshman?
and you got an 1140, so you're doomed, and we can kiss this "get to know Hearst" weekend goodbye.
not so fast.
now, if you average in my points, assists, and free-throw percentage, it all balances out.
now, that coach says it's down to me and one other guy for that scholarship, so we are going.
come on. You'll like it.
it's a good school.
and if I were in, say, Maine, I'd excited.
but it's in Neptune, so I'm not excited.
I'll go, but just to skip school, which excites me.
don't leave me hanging.
okay, forget five. Give me two.
where have you been all day?
I wanted to congratulate you on the big news, but I couldn't find you.
I ended up telling the janitor that your locker was mine and I forgot my combination so he'd open it up and I could lee you a little surprise.
but I made it before I heard they dropped the charges, so keep that in mind.
you lied to a janitor?
I've resigned myself to burning in hell.
you know, all the girls on track are jealous of me.
I'm sure they could burn in hell, too, if they'd just put in the effort.
no.
they're jealous because after the meet on sunday they're going to rusty's ranch and I'm going sailing with this totally hot senior.
we can't see each other anymore.
what?
so, what is this some kind of weird joke that's going over my head?
I mean, you're a really sweet girl, but...
but what?
but I'm not a sweet guy.
if this is really some kind of joke, please tell me the punch line soon.
cause I could really use a laugh about now.
Hey, is this the tour?
all right, everyone gather around.
welcome to the little slice of liberal-arts paradise known as Hearst College.
my name is Dean. I'm going to be your tour guide.
so, as you know, this is going to be a three-day tour, and it's important that we all get to know each other.
so right now we're going to play a little "get to know you" game, so everyone pair up.
Oh, make sure it's someone that you don't already know.
sorry, I don't know her.
and so, it turns out college is very much like high school.
we're gonna play a game called "two truths and a lie."Does everyone have a buddy?
all alone?
it's all rht. I prefer it.
lie
see, that's how the game works.
you have to tell your partner two facts and one lie, and they he to guess which one is the lie, all right?
okay, so, go ahead.
okay, I'm Veronica,
I'm from Neptune, and I once shot a man in reno just to watch him die.
how'd that go?
it was a bit of a letdown.
well, I don't believe that you're from Neptune.
wrong.
is that the end?
um, okay. Well, my name is Dean.
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois, my father owns a Ford dealership, and I also shot a man in reno, but it was not to watch him die. It was for other issues.
your father doesn't sell Fords.
that's right --Toyotas. How did you know?
it's all ithe eyes.
all right. I guess I'll have to watch out for you next year.
Oh, I won't be attending.
all right, enough lies. all right I think I've got you a new partner.
are you with the tour? -Yeah, that's right.
okay, come meet potential new classmate Veronica.
Veronica, meet...
do you two know each other?
you're not supposed to be with someone you know.
Nope, I don't know him at all.
a long time ago, we used toe friends but I haven't thought of you lately at all come on, now, sugar bring it on, bring it on, yeah just remember me when we used to be friends a long time ago we used to be friends
uh, so, this is weird.
um, how you been, Veronica?
lie -- I don't believe you're really interested.
next statement okay, I can understand that after what I did, but I'm sorry.
I don't think you understand the rules of this game.
you only get one lie.
okay, uh, let me start over.
three statements, one false.
um, my name's Troy.
I was a bad boy when we dated, but after a year of private school, therapy, quitting drugs, and dumping my loose-cannon ex-girlfriend,
I've changed into a more-or-less good boy.
and I communicate telepathically with all denizens of the sea.
right.
so, how long before I catch you talking to a manatee?
and you have changed not at all.
you know me -- same old, same old.
all right, everyone, follow me, please.
we're gonna get the tour started, so come this way. Stay in a group.
I'm not lying to you, Veronica. I just want you to know that.
do I care?
really, Troy, you're just water under the bridge...
duplicitous, evil water.
dude!
so, we hanging this weekend, or that chick still have your sac locked up in her easy-bake oven?
actually, I am now a free man.
the way we should be, man.
we?
what happened to Madison?
bailed.
according to her friend, she met someone more mature.
where, at legoland?
whatever, man.
Maturity's one of the two most overrated things on the anet.
the other being?
chicks.
Oh, so, this worked out great for you.
dude, why do you think I'm in such a good mood?
screw it. This weekend, you and me are partying like ozzy.
so, it seems Hearst College pretty much has it all.
campus combining modern facilities with the best traditions of learning check.
no, Heidegger is fine if you're a nazi.
a student body composed of diverse, interesting, smart people check.
and drunken doofuses who corner you to tally your points
check.
so, you're blond
30 points
and a natural, too -- another 20.
you are supercute -- 50 points.
and you're kind of, like, sassy.
so, sassy is good?
more like a degree-of-difficulty thing -- 30 points.
and you're a profro -- 80 points.
so, if someone were to have sex with me, they'd walk away with 2 points?
that's high. You should be psyched.
I am...inside.
so, what do you think then... about us getting busy?
can I have your beer?
sure.
Damn! Grow a sense of humor, you crazy bitch!
I would if something funny would ever happen.
tell me how you like it.
it's fun, but it's getting kind of old.
you do that again
he you'll what?
let her go or I'll make sure you regret it.
what?
I think the implication is clear.
you're gonna let her go on your own initiative.
or do I have to
initiative.
as much as I appreciate that display of chivalry,
I had it covered.
maybe I wanted to demonstrate that i really have changed.
so you're no longer evil. You're stupid.
Congratulations.
that guy is such a tool. Can I get you a beer or something?
uh, how about if I get you one?
so, chivalry isn't dead.
it just can't fight. Yeah, let's go.
smooth. -Hey, some things I can't change.
I'm gonna like it here.
how you doing?
you weirded out Troy's here?
Nah, water under the bridge.
Hey, my profros.
it's a fun party, huh?
not bad.
I actually talked to a cute girl about Kierkegaard.
made me wish I knew something about Kierkegaard.
Yeah, isn't that cool? I mean, in high school, parties are just guys getting drunk and scamming on chicks, but here you have intellectual conversations.
right.
like I saw you talking to that guy -- what'd you talk about?
Jane Austen, but he dissed "pride and prejudice,"
so I had to throw a beer on him.
I'm kind of colleged-out.
Yeah, all right.
well, I'll s you guys tomorrow.
go, Hearst!
there goes your water.
I mean, your body is slammin'! That's like 50 points right there.
and this might sound like a weird queson, but you're not an orphan?
Yeah, 12th floor, just got off the elevator.
got the key card, but it took some smooth talking.
I don't see why you couldn't just open the door.
it's a funny story, actually.
just please don't judge.
you can laugh privately later.
I don't suppose you have a key?
so...
...can I ask you a question?
well, she said her name was daphne.
no, no, no.
how did you call me?
Acrobatically.
I might have pulled a hamstring.
okay, then, next question.
last night was the convention of the south coast ob-gyn society, the most-sued medical specialty, so I make it a point to swing by every year and spread my card around.
and you met a hell of a lady doctor?
hell of a lady, yes.
doctor?
we met at the bar.
I was extremely charming, and an hour later, I'm invited up to her room.
champagne is ordered.
one thing leads to another.
why don't you think she was an ob-gyn?
well, one, she appeared to know less about medicine than I do.
and two, she seems to have stolen my briefcase.
Thanks.
dad, the phone is ringing!
Loly.
Veronica, it's Troy.
if you're there, please pick up.
please pick up.
Troy, how was your evening?
you're where?
what are you doing here?
the usual hair and blood samples, cheek swab.
remember that girl from the party last night -- Stacy?
well, I guess she got date-raped.
actually, no.
when they use roofies to knock them out, then shave their head afterward, we drop the "date" part.
don't look at me like that, Veronica.
I swear to god, I didn't do it.
you got to help me.
God, Veronica, roofie and rape someone, shave their head?
how sick in the head do you think I am?
I don't really know much about the inside of your head, do I?
why do they think you did it?
I was the last thing that Stacy remembered before she passed out.
everyone saw us go upstairs together.
there's hair and fibers of mine on her.
and when they tested my clothes from last night...
what did they find?
that they'd just been washed.
you did laundry at 3: 00 in the morning?
why would the cops be suspicious of that?
God, Troy.
look -- yes, we went upstairs and fooled around, strictly pg-13.
then she pukes all over me.
but, being the chivalrous guy I now am...
I cleaned up, I took off her shoes, I tucked her in, and then I went to wash my only change of clothes at the all-night laundry.
that is the truth. I swear.
if I decide you're guilty,
I'll help hold the hammer while they nail you to the wall.
do you remember anything else about last night?
anyone hanging around her?
I remember getting the stink eye from this guy who was hitting on her earlier.
what guy?
long, dark hair, blue sweatshirt with, like, a pi sign.
So,"Daphne" registered under a lse name and credit card.
dead end there, so I got the elevator security tape from last night.
you must be on good terms with the Neptune grand security people.
when my daughter dated a billionaire's kid living alone in the president's suite, me and the security guys got pretty tight.
so, what was in the briefcase that anyone might want to swipe?
just case files -- a drunken assault, a lewd conduct, a fraud, a divorce -- aha!
Hello, Daphne.
5: 53, she checks in.
you actually believed she was a gynecologist?
so, other than the files, it's an address book, receipts, some keys,
I believe a copy of elle magazine, but I forget why -- oh, and the murder case files.
Logan Echolls? Which ones?
everything.
what wasn't in the briefcase is in their storage locker, which is one of the keys.
but that case was dismissed, -so it's -- -at 10: 15, you're on your way up.
my god, Cliff, you're like a wild animal.
is that what t kids call motorboating?
I have a zest for life. So sue me.
look.
it appears lamb has a bit of a zest for life himself.
2: 11, there's your briefcase.
lamb appears to know your gynecologist.
don't mind me. Just keep doing whatever that is.
uh, just work.
I thought you had that Hearst thing.
on my way.
I just need an address.
Oh, my god.
I know her.
she goes to my school.
her name is Madison Sinclair.
nice.
a little more vomit and a dead donkey, and you've got a cover spread in modern squalor magazine.
and doesn't it make sense this is the home of mr. Points himself, and of our pi sig brother of the long, dark hair,
Hi.
uh... Chip.
sorry, brothers only past the entryway without invitation.
Hi, chip. Is gordon here, gordon peters?
you might check the hospital.
the hospital?
had to have his stomach pumped last night.
18 shots of jager -- not a good idea.
who knew? -Kind of a wuss, huh?
legacy?
well, it's only gonna get worse when hgets back here.
you can leave a message for him on the board if you want.
so, any english lit or humanities geeks with us here?
english or maybe double with pre-med?
what did you find?
the pi sig who was hitting on Stacy spent the night in the hospital getting his stomach pumped.
I double-checked.
so, what are you doing over here?
looks like Dean's got a great story about the front of that building.
I kind of bailed on the tour. I got tired of the looks, u know?
so, you figured creepy skulking was a better use of your time?
that won't make you sm guilty.
see? Looks.
if you can't give me anything morto go on, you might need to get used to it.
my name and number.
I left my name and number on her message board.
would I do that if I just raped her and shaved off all her hair?
so, I could go check and your name and number would be there?
maybe you could just believe me.
I'll check.
dude, you know what I'm gonna do to you?
no. First I'm gonna kick your ass, then I'm gonna grab your head and yank out your spine.
what do you think about that?
is that okay?
okay.
look, look -- I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
say hello to your spine.
it's me, your spine.
what?
I'm just imagining what ozzy would think of your concept of partying like ozzy.
you want to snort a line of ants?
I'm in.
come on, we're free men who reject the rule of women.
get into the spirit. I mean, exhibit "A," exhibit "B."
my suspicion is you're afraid to embrace your true nature.
which is?
we are lone woes, dude, high-plains drifters, life takers and heartbreakers.
who play video games all day.
who don't give a damn about what other people say 'cause they don't give a rat's ass.
dude, you got cake.
what the hell, man?
what is this?
it's nothing. It's a file. It's a joke.
but you're right
life takers and heartbreakers.
to not giving the ass of a rat.
would Troy actually lie about his name and number?
despite my deep reserves of ill will, do I really believe he could be that horrible?
so, it's half there, and he's only half-horrible.
do you need something?
uh, no, I was just
I'm Veronica.
I was at the party last night.
that was, like, the best party ever, right?
how was your rape?
so, what, are you dropping off some pamphlets or something?
no.
a pamphlet's not gonna cover it.
it's just gonna suck.
and then it'll suck less.
I'm sorry to bother you.
did they catch the guy from the party?
it was kind of complicated.
I don't really know wh happened.
I think they're just trying to get all the facts straight.
the facts are straight.
I know who it was.
I just want some biblical justice.
he shaved my head.
what's that?
I don't know. It was here.
ohgod, that is just...
that's not my hair.
it's not yours?
Stacy, are you okay?
did you see who delivered that box?
what is she doing here?
nothing. She was at the party.
Yeah, she was there with him, Stacy.
what?
she's trying to help him get off the hook.
so, if someone sent Stacy a box of hair that wasn't hers, there's a chance she's not the only victim and there's another girl at Hearst forced to wear a wig.
d so, I will now clinch that Emmy nomination.
Hi,
I'm looking for someone.
she would have come in for a wig during the past couple of months.
can you narrow it down, hon?
we get a lot of
her head would have been completely shaved.
Oh, chemo.
she decided to give up on treatment and run away from home.
there was a girl a month ago.
do you have a name?
you don't know her name?
because we don'tjust give out custom
ma'am, she's run away.
she's scared, and she's alone.
we don't even want to know how she's making her money.
she's given up on life.
and she thinks she's sparing us the pain, but not knowing where she is or what name she's using or whether she's safe -- it's torture.
please, ma'am, she's my sister.
I'm sorry. This girl was hawaiian.
Oh.
Oh, hey.
you know, the tour doesn'start until noon.
if I wanted to find a hawaiian girl, where would I start?
in hawaii?
I'm sorry, I don't understand hawaiian students at Hearst.
Oh, the pacific-islander kids.
well, some of them have a lunch-group thing at the student union on weekends.
Thanks.
yeah?
what does is mean -- "Cl"?
Oh, that's a score.
it's 150 in roman numerals.
it's a pi sig thing. They have, like, a contest for scoring girls or something.
50 points for a blond, 30 points for sassy.
I don't know if you get points for being sassy, but, yeah.
the rumor is that they have a board in the basement that they keep score on.
if the pledges don't score high enough, they're punished.
punished?
they shave your head.
the contest ended at midnight. It stupid anyway, you know.
good old pi sigs. Thanks, Dean.
sure.
don, do you have time for a question?
for the two of you...
always.
we're just looking for a little help here.
do you know this woman?
no. We got to do this again sometime.
you sure?
you got me.
I rode an elevator with her, she asked the time, and I tell her.
uh, sheriff, just a couple more shots?
I want to emphasize this should not be construed as coercion.
we're just showing you a picture.
that's Madison Sinclair, who I believe takes world history with my daughter.
so, what? This is blackmail?
she's 18. That's legal.
sounds like a swell campaign slogan for the next election.
we just nt to know who this first woman is.
she's an escort.
I've busted her a few times.
she hires out as "sugar jones."
great. Thanks, don.
I'd vote for you.
so, you get that scholarship, you got to join.
when iot here, I was like, "I totally want to be a pi."
uh, yeah.
once when I was little, I wanted to be ice cream.
dude! Pi sig sig -- you're hilarious.
you'll totally fit in.
that's members-only down there.
the kitchen is through here.
"C" in roman numerals is 100, so the big question is did any of these delightful people score the three "C"s
I saw circled on Stacy's door?
and someone with the handle "bird dog" says he scored me?
that is wrong both factually and ontologically.
there -- 300 points.
and the hero of the hour?
of course his name is "ice man."
Hey!
you can't be down here!
Hey, ice man!
there's some chick in the sanctum.
what the hell are you doing here?
this is off-limits!
clear on out. Pronto, okay?
300 points?
nice work.
this is our business.
I don't have to apologize -- -for being a rapist?
nice.
I admire a principled stand.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about 300 points, exactly the score you goons wrote on Stacy's door the night she was roofie and raped.
but the jury will understand.
after all, you had to do it, or your frat brothers would shave off your awesome ryan seacrest hairdo.
I didn't get those 300 points for Stacy Wells.
Yeah, he nailed the Dean's wife.
zip it, Gordo.
look, no one here ever touched Stacy.
you're Gordon?
what happened to the rock-star locks?
you mean pi sigs don't give points for rape?
Stacy's gonna hate hearing that no good came out of friday night.
I don't give a flying nun what she thinks.
she's a total tease.
she was coming onto me all night, and then she blew me off for some other dude who called her bluff.
boohoo.
bird dog, do you want to show this young lady out?
Thanks, I know the way.
and you might want to get your clippers because unless being electrocuted counts, bird dog here never scored these 240 points.
it was 210.
you under-counted the sassy.
and this looks like it must be the pacific-islander lunch group.
now, who might be wearing a wig?
I think I'll follow a hunch.
excuse me.
Hi, I'm working on a play for the theater department, and I need to find a place that does custom wigs.
did you get yours recently, and did you get it around here?
my what? Wig?
this is my hair.
Oh...
I th
I'm sorry. I thought
Thanks, anyway.
great, a dead end, and embarrassing to boot.
excuse me.
y-you might try tori'S.
on pacific?
Thanks.
Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
it's about a girl who was raped and had her head shaved the other night.
Oh, Miss wells.
Hey, dean Harlow.
I got a message from someone saying you had some information for me, like about that guy.
I'm still waiting to hear from the sheriff.
I haven't heard anything.
I left the message.
and... I do have information.
Troy's being drawn and quartered? -No. -Then I'm not interested.
Stacy, it wasn't Troy.
he didn't rape you, and he didn't leave the box of hair.
because good old Troy's a decent, stand-up guy simply not capable of doing something so horrible, right?
because it happened to me, too...a month ago.
whoever did thiso you did the same thing to dawn when Troy was on the other side of the country.
I'm not saying it wasn't horrible or you don't deserve justice.
I'm just saying someone else did it, and that someone is still out there.
the same thing?
did he send you a box with
no.
that was a nasty little gift from a pi sig named Gordon Peters.
he was bitter because you didn't fall for his charm, and not scoring with the ladies meant getting his head shaved.
I think you'll find that hair is his.
and since you're the dean of student affairs,
I thought you might be interested.
these are some sdent affairs going on in the basement of the pi sig house.
don't think you want that getting into the hearst brochure.
well, that's it. That's the last you're gonna see of me.
the final event now is doughnuts with the dean in michael hall, and if I've done my job, you don't have to ask me where that is.
so, I hope to see you guys next year.
I hope so, too.
admit it.
Hearst ain't half-bad.
it is.
that means half of it might be good.
you talking about me again?
so, they dropped the charges.
Thanks, Veronica, real.
I'm not sure that I deserve it, but...
you're a real friend.
how about we just call me an acquaintance with reservations?
right.
then, until next time -- go, Hearst!
right.
Hey, you guys hear about the pi sigs?
Nope.
they got a semester of probation.
if it's double-secret probation, there's a serious leak.
no mixers, no parties, no sports.
and it was your photo that nailed them. You don't mess around, do you?
that's Veronica mars making friends and influencing people wherever she goes.
see, if you come here next year, you' already got enemies.
just feel right at home.
see you.
I heard you wanted to see me.
I did. I thought you might wa your hair back.
uh, I don't want that.
fair enough.
Oh, my god. What -- are you crazy? What are you doing?
what are
your dad dropped his testimony so I'd quit seeing you.
I figured.
so, did you ask me out so he'd do it?
Yes.
and you want me to forgive you?
Yes.
you're back early.
Yeah, I ditched the goodbye hugging.
can you believe it?
you? Miss hug?
so, you must be tired. Why don't you lie in your
is Keith here?
dad?
your hooker's here.
escort, honey.
so, why don't you go to your room and do your blog
whatever you ks do.
sorry about that.
so...
what do you got in mind?
a few questions to start off.
the briefcase
tell us why you took it and where it went.
well, I got the call.
I show up.
the guy offers me triple rate if I pick him up and swipe his briefcase.
so, who's the guy?
let me see. You know,
I think I've got his birth certificate in here somewhere.
no. He didn't say.
what happened to my briefcase?
I gave it to him in the garage. I split.
what he did with it, I have no idea.
so, is that it?
I guess so. But, hey, nice work.
I really thought...
it w all real.
just the welts, honey.
enough!
dad, what are you doing here?
get dressed.
get dressed! -I am.
I told you to stay away from her.
you're lucky I don't kill you.
dad, he -- -Hannah, get your things.
don't speak to her like that.
we had a deal. -Yes,"had." Now we don't.
there's nothing you can do that'll stop me from seeing her.
you want to bet?
so if you go to Hearst you can go home and do your laundry at weekend the French Revolution, boys, whatever.
I told you, dad. I am going far, far away.
it's a deal breaker.
Hearst is 10 whole exits.
what do you know about plastic explosives?
that's what I like -- a good segue.
I mean, where you get them, what they're used for.
well, if you're licensed, legitimate uses include construction, mining, demolition.
demolition.
dear Mr. Fennel, it is with great pleasure
you got the scholarship.
two times.
Hearst college, baby, here I come!
I am so over this place already.
right there with you.
Hey, did Hannah miss school today?
you didn't hear?
no.
her parents sent her to boarding school in Vermont.
she's gone.
so, the contest winner gets to push that thing
you know, that thing like bugs bunny always pushes
and the stadium explodes?
a plunger, right.
but if we did our work right, the stadium implodes.
cool.
using dynamite?
some, but c-4 mostly.
what's c-4?
not much to look at, actually, but it does the job.
and it's the exact same stuff I saw in the airplane hangar.
I told you to take that crate to section 11!
one more question
is it just a coincidence that danny boyd works here or do I now have to add the Fitzpatricks to the list of people who could have framed Terrence cook or even crashed the bus?
I've walked right into the river stix, home base for the fighting Fzpatricks.
I have information about that mexican kid who got killed.
your dad is in deep to the Fitzpatrick family.
toying with a sweet little girl's heart just to screw with her dad?
Jackie and I borrowed one of Terrence's cars tonight.
I was digging around where heeeps them, and I found some sort of explosive.
is that c-4? -You'll have to wait for the press conference.
flat? -Just as god made me.
I'm Troy, by the way.
I'm Veronica.
I'm just glad we weren't dating when you were kicked out of school for drug possession and trafficking.
county supervisor's office?
well read, Dick. You're making great strides.
so, good news
you are no longer writing about the use of mythic archetype in "portrait of the artist as a young man."
all right.
you are all instead entering our mayor, Woody Goodman's, county-wide essay contest on the subject of...freedom.
the winner gets a week's internship as woody's apprentice, which means an opportunity to learn about civic affairs, a plum entry on your college applications, and -- this might interest you, Dick
a chance to stand beside Woody Goodman on tv and push the plunger for the demolition of old shark stadium.
nuke the stadium.
damn. Now I totally wish I could write good.
so, you should be able to write quite an essay on freedom.
how does it feel to have your case dismissed?
freedom feels liberating.
so, you've got your title.
and did Hannah understand why you wouldn't be seeing her anymore?
you didn't tell her, did you?
you owe her an explanation.
what exactly am I supposed to say?
man, you believe it about Logan?
that guy's like a cat.
you mean useless and selfish?
I mean like nine lives.
I just wish I knew how he does it.
that's funny. I do know how he does it, and I wish I didn't.
what you got?
the pamphlet?
from the Hearst packet that we both got, in the envelope that we both got that you didn't open.
Oh, that.
you know the average S. A.T. Score for a Hearst freshman?
and you got an 1140, so you're doomed, and we can kiss this "get to know Hearst" weekend goodbye.
not so fast.
now, if you average in my points, assists, and free-throw percentage, it all balances out.
now, that coach says it's down to me and one other guy for that scholarship, so we are going.
come on. You'll like it.
it's a good school.
and if I were in, say, Maine, I'd excited.
but it's in Neptune, so I'm not excited.
I'll go, but just to skip school, which excites me.
don't leave me hanging.
okay, forget five. Give me two.
where have you been all day?
I wanted to congratulate you on the big news, but I couldn't find you.
I ended up telling the janitor that your locker was mine and I forgot my combination so he'd open it up and I could lee you a little surprise.
but I made it before I heard they dropped the charges, so keep that in mind.
you lied to a janitor?
I've resigned myself to burning in hell.
you know, all the girls on track are jealous of me.
I'm sure they could burn in hell, too, if they'd just put in the effort.
no.
they're jealous because after the meet on sunday they're going to rusty's ranch and I'm going sailing with this totally hot senior.
we can't see each other anymore.
what?
so, what is this some kind of weird joke that's going over my head?
I mean, you're a really sweet girl, but...
but what?
but I'm not a sweet guy.
if this is really some kind of joke, please tell me the punch line soon.
cause I could really use a laugh about now.
Hey, is this the tour?
all right, everyone gather around.
welcome to the little slice of liberal-arts paradise known as Hearst College.
my name is Dean. I'm going to be your tour guide.
so, as you know, this is going to be a three-day tour, and it's important that we all get to know each other.
so right now we're going to play a little "get to know you" game, so everyone pair up.
Oh, make sure it's someone that you don't already know.
sorry, I don't know her.
and so, it turns out college is very much like high school.
we're gonna play a game called "two truths and a lie."Does everyone have a buddy?
all alone?
it's all rht. I prefer it.
lie
see, that's how the game works.
you have to tell your partner two facts and one lie, and they he to guess which one is the lie, all right?
okay, so, go ahead.
okay, I'm Veronica,
I'm from Neptune, and I once shot a man in reno just to watch him die.
how'd that go?
it was a bit of a letdown.
well, I don't believe that you're from Neptune.
wrong.
is that the end?
um, okay. Well, my name is Dean.
I'm from Wheaton, Illinois, my father owns a Ford dealership, and I also shot a man in reno, but it was not to watch him die. It was for other issues.
your father doesn't sell Fords.
that's right --Toyotas. How did you know?
it's all ithe eyes.
all right. I guess I'll have to watch out for you next year.
Oh, I won't be attending.
all right, enough lies. all right I think I've got you a new partner.
are you with the tour? -Yeah, that's right.
okay, come meet potential new classmate Veronica.
Veronica, meet...
do you two know each other?
you're not supposed to be with someone you know.
Nope, I don't know him at all.
a long time ago, we used toe friends but I haven't thought of you lately at all come on, now, sugar bring it on, bring it on, yeah just remember me when we used to be friends a long time ago we used to be friends
uh, so, this is weird.
um, how you been, Veronica?
lie -- I don't believe you're really interested.
next statement okay, I can understand that after what I did, but I'm sorry.
I don't think you understand the rules of this game.
you only get one lie.
okay, uh, let me start over.
three statements, one false.
um, my name's Troy.
I was a bad boy when we dated, but after a year of private school, therapy, quitting drugs, and dumping my loose-cannon ex-girlfriend,
I've changed into a more-or-less good boy.
and I communicate telepathically with all denizens of the sea.
right.
so, how long before I catch you talking to a manatee?
and you have changed not at all.
you know me -- same old, same old.
all right, everyone, follow me, please.
we're gonna get the tour started, so come this way. Stay in a group.
I'm not lying to you, Veronica. I just want you to know that.
do I care?
really, Troy, you're just water under the bridge...
duplicitous, evil water.
dude!
so, we hanging this weekend, or that chick still have your sac locked up in her easy-bake oven?
actually, I am now a free man.
the way we should be, man.
we?
what happened to Madison?
bailed.
according to her friend, she met someone more mature.
where, at legoland?
whatever, man.
Maturity's one of the two most overrated things on the anet.
the other being?
chicks.
Oh, so, this worked out great for you.
dude, why do you think I'm in such a good mood?
screw it. This weekend, you and me are partying like ozzy.
so, it seems Hearst College pretty much has it all.
campus combining modern facilities with the best traditions of learning check.
no, Heidegger is fine if you're a nazi.
a student body composed of diverse, interesting, smart people check.
and drunken doofuses who corner you to tally your points
check.
so, you're blond
30 points
and a natural, too -- another 20.
you are supercute -- 50 points.
and you're kind of, like, sassy.
so, sassy is good?
more like a degree-of-difficulty thing -- 30 points.
and you're a profro -- 80 points.
so, if someone were to have sex with me, they'd walk away with 2 points?
that's high. You should be psyched.
I am...inside.
so, what do you think then... about us getting busy?
can I have your beer?
sure.
Damn! Grow a sense of humor, you crazy bitch!
I would if something funny would ever happen.
tell me how you like it.
it's fun, but it's getting kind of old.
you do that again
he you'll what?
let her go or I'll make sure you regret it.
what?
I think the implication is clear.
you're gonna let her go on your own initiative.
or do I have to
initiative.
as much as I appreciate that display of chivalry,
I had it covered.
maybe I wanted to demonstrate that i really have changed.
so you're no longer evil. You're stupid.
Congratulations.
that guy is such a tool. Can I get you a beer or something?
uh, how about if I get you one?
so, chivalry isn't dead.
it just can't fight. Yeah, let's go.
smooth. -Hey, some things I can't change.
I'm gonna like it here.
how you doing?
you weirded out Troy's here?
Nah, water under the bridge.
Hey, my profros.
it's a fun party, huh?
not bad.
I actually talked to a cute girl about Kierkegaard.
made me wish I knew something about Kierkegaard.
Yeah, isn't that cool? I mean, in high school, parties are just guys getting drunk and scamming on chicks, but here you have intellectual conversations.
right.
like I saw you talking to that guy -- what'd you talk about?
Jane Austen, but he dissed "pride and prejudice,"
so I had to throw a beer on him.
I'm kind of colleged-out.
Yeah, all right.
well, I'll s you guys tomorrow.
go, Hearst!
there goes your water.
I mean, your body is slammin'! That's like 50 points right there.
and this might sound like a weird queson, but you're not an orphan?
Yeah, 12th floor, just got off the elevator.
got the key card, but it took some smooth talking.
I don't see why you couldn't just open the door.
it's a funny story, actually.
just please don't judge.
you can laugh privately later.
I don't suppose you have a key?
so...
...can I ask you a question?
well, she said her name was daphne.
no, no, no.
how did you call me?
Acrobatically.
I might have pulled a hamstring.
okay, then, next question.
last night was the convention of the south coast ob-gyn society, the most-sued medical specialty, so I make it a point to swing by every year and spread my card around.
and you met a hell of a lady doctor?
hell of a lady, yes.
doctor?
we met at the bar.
I was extremely charming, and an hour later, I'm invited up to her room.
champagne is ordered.
one thing leads to another.
why don't you think she was an ob-gyn?
well, one, she appeared to know less about medicine than I do.
and two, she seems to have stolen my briefcase.
Thanks.
dad, the phone is ringing!
Loly.
Veronica, it's Troy.
if you're there, please pick up.
please pick up.
Troy, how was your evening?
you're where?
what are you doing here?
the usual hair and blood samples, cheek swab.
remember that girl from the party last night -- Stacy?
well, I guess she got date-raped.
actually, no.
when they use roofies to knock them out, then shave their head afterward, we drop the "date" part.
don't look at me like that, Veronica.
I swear to god, I didn't do it.
you got to help me.
God, Veronica, roofie and rape someone, shave their head?
how sick in the head do you think I am?
I don't really know much about the inside of your head, do I?
why do they think you did it?
I was the last thing that Stacy remembered before she passed out.
everyone saw us go upstairs together.
there's hair and fibers of mine on her.
and when they tested my clothes from last night...
what did they find?
that they'd just been washed.
you did laundry at 3: 00 in the morning?
why would the cops be suspicious of that?
God, Troy.
look -- yes, we went upstairs and fooled around, strictly pg-13.
then she pukes all over me.
but, being the chivalrous guy I now am...
I cleaned up, I took off her shoes, I tucked her in, and then I went to wash my only change of clothes at the all-night laundry.
that is the truth. I swear.
if I decide you're guilty,
I'll help hold the hammer while they nail you to the wall.
do you remember anything else about last night?
anyone hanging around her?
I remember getting the stink eye from this guy who was hitting on her earlier.
what guy?
long, dark hair, blue sweatshirt with, like, a pi sign.
So,"Daphne" registered under a lse name and credit card.
dead end there, so I got the elevator security tape from last night.
you must be on good terms with the Neptune grand security people.
when my daughter dated a billionaire's kid living alone in the president's suite, me and the security guys got pretty tight.
so, what was in the briefcase that anyone might want to swipe?
just case files -- a drunken assault, a lewd conduct, a fraud, a divorce -- aha!
Hello, Daphne.
5: 53, she checks in.
you actually believed she was a gynecologist?
so, other than the files, it's an address book, receipts, some keys,
I believe a copy of elle magazine, but I forget why -- oh, and the murder case files.
Logan Echolls? Which ones?
everything.
what wasn't in the briefcase is in their storage locker, which is one of the keys.
but that case was dismissed, -so it's -- -at 10: 15, you're on your way up.
my god, Cliff, you're like a wild animal.
is that what t kids call motorboating?
I have a zest for life. So sue me.
look.
it appears lamb has a bit of a zest for life himself.
2: 11, there's your briefcase.
lamb appears to know your gynecologist.
don't mind me. Just keep doing whatever that is.
uh, just work.
I thought you had that Hearst thing.
on my way.
I just need an address.
Oh, my god.
I know her.
she goes to my school.
her name is Madison Sinclair.
nice.
a little more vomit and a dead donkey, and you've got a cover spread in modern squalor magazine.
and doesn't it make sense this is the home of mr. Points himself, and of our pi sig brother of the long, dark hair,
Hi.
uh... Chip.
sorry, brothers only past the entryway without invitation.
Hi, chip. Is gordon here, gordon peters?
you might check the hospital.
the hospital?
had to have his stomach pumped last night.
18 shots of jager -- not a good idea.
who knew? -Kind of a wuss, huh?
legacy?
well, it's only gonna get worse when hgets back here.
you can leave a message for him on the board if you want.
so, any english lit or humanities geeks with us here?
english or maybe double with pre-med?
what did you find?
the pi sig who was hitting on Stacy spent the night in the hospital getting his stomach pumped.
I double-checked.
so, what are you doing over here?
looks like Dean's got a great story about the front of that building.
I kind of bailed on the tour. I got tired of the looks, u know?
so, you figured creepy skulking was a better use of your time?
that won't make you sm guilty.
see? Looks.
if you can't give me anything morto go on, you might need to get used to it.
my name and number.
I left my name and number on her message board.
would I do that if I just raped her and shaved off all her hair?
so, I could go check and your name and number would be there?
maybe you could just believe me.
I'll check.
dude, you know what I'm gonna do to you?
no. First I'm gonna kick your ass, then I'm gonna grab your head and yank out your spine.
what do you think about that?
is that okay?
okay.
look, look -- I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
say hello to your spine.
it's me, your spine.
what?
I'm just imagining what ozzy would think of your concept of partying like ozzy.
you want to snort a line of ants?
I'm in.
come on, we're free men who reject the rule of women.
get into the spirit. I mean, exhibit "A," exhibit "B."
my suspicion is you're afraid to embrace your true nature.
which is?
we are lone woes, dude, high-plains drifters, life takers and heartbreakers.
who play video games all day.
who don't give a damn about what other people say 'cause they don't give a rat's ass.
dude, you got cake.
what the hell, man?
what is this?
it's nothing. It's a file. It's a joke.
but you're right
life takers and heartbreakers.
to not giving the ass of a rat.
would Troy actually lie about his name and number?
despite my deep reserves of ill will, do I really believe he could be that horrible?
so, it's half there, and he's only half-horrible.
do you need something?
uh, no, I was just
I'm Veronica.
I was at the party last night.
that was, like, the best party ever, right?
how was your rape?
so, what, are you dropping off some pamphlets or something?
no.
a pamphlet's not gonna cover it.
it's just gonna suck.
and then it'll suck less.
I'm sorry to bother you.
did they catch the guy from the party?
it was kind of complicated.
I don't really know wh happened.
I think they're just trying to get all the facts straight.
the facts are straight.
I know who it was.
I just want some biblical justice.
he shaved my head.
what's that?
I don't know. It was here.
ohgod, that is just...
that's not my hair.
it's not yours?
Stacy, are you okay?
did you see who delivered that box?
what is she doing here?
nothing. She was at the party.
Yeah, she was there with him, Stacy.
what?
she's trying to help him get off the hook.
so, if someone sent Stacy a box of hair that wasn't hers, there's a chance she's not the only victim and there's another girl at Hearst forced to wear a wig.
d so, I will now clinch that Emmy nomination.
Hi,
I'm looking for someone.
she would have come in for a wig during the past couple of months.
can you narrow it down, hon?
we get a lot of
her head would have been completely shaved.
Oh, chemo.
she decided to give up on treatment and run away from home.
there was a girl a month ago.
do you have a name?
you don't know her name?
because we don'tjust give out custom
ma'am, she's run away.
she's scared, and she's alone.
we don't even want to know how she's making her money.
she's given up on life.
and she thinks she's sparing us the pain, but not knowing where she is or what name she's using or whether she's safe -- it's torture.
please, ma'am, she's my sister.
I'm sorry. This girl was hawaiian.
Oh.
Oh, hey.
you know, the tour doesn'start until noon.
if I wanted to find a hawaiian girl, where would I start?
in hawaii?
I'm sorry, I don't understand hawaiian students at Hearst.
Oh, the pacific-islander kids.
well, some of them have a lunch-group thing at the student union on weekends.
Thanks.
yeah?
what does is mean -- "Cl"?
Oh, that's a score.
it's 150 in roman numerals.
it's a pi sig thing. They have, like, a contest for scoring girls or something.
50 points for a blond, 30 points for sassy.
I don't know if you get points for being sassy, but, yeah.
the rumor is that they have a board in the basement that they keep score on.
if the pledges don't score high enough, they're punished.
punished?
they shave your head.
the contest ended at midnight. It stupid anyway, you know.
good old pi sigs. Thanks, Dean.
sure.
don, do you have time for a question?
for the two of you...
always.
we're just looking for a little help here.
do you know this woman?
no. We got to do this again sometime.
you sure?
you got me.
I rode an elevator with her, she asked the time, and I tell her.
uh, sheriff, just a couple more shots?
I want to emphasize this should not be construed as coercion.
we're just showing you a picture.
that's Madison Sinclair, who I believe takes world history with my daughter.
so, what? This is blackmail?
she's 18. That's legal.
sounds like a swell campaign slogan for the next election.
we just nt to know who this first woman is.
she's an escort.
I've busted her a few times.
she hires out as "sugar jones."
great. Thanks, don.
I'd vote for you.
so, you get that scholarship, you got to join.
when iot here, I was like, "I totally want to be a pi."
uh, yeah.
once when I was little, I wanted to be ice cream.
dude! Pi sig sig -- you're hilarious.
you'll totally fit in.
that's members-only down there.
the kitchen is through here.
"C" in roman numerals is 100, so the big question is did any of these delightful people score the three "C"s
I saw circled on Stacy's door?
and someone with the handle "bird dog" says he scored me?
that is wrong both factually and ontologically.
there -- 300 points.
and the hero of the hour?
of course his name is "ice man."
Hey!
you can't be down here!
Hey, ice man!
there's some chick in the sanctum.
what the hell are you doing here?
this is off-limits!
clear on out. Pronto, okay?
300 points?
nice work.
this is our business.
I don't have to apologize -- -for being a rapist?
nice.
I admire a principled stand.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about 300 points, exactly the score you goons wrote on Stacy's door the night she was roofie and raped.
but the jury will understand.
after all, you had to do it, or your frat brothers would shave off your awesome ryan seacrest hairdo.
I didn't get those 300 points for Stacy Wells.
Yeah, he nailed the Dean's wife.
zip it, Gordo.
look, no one here ever touched Stacy.
you're Gordon?
what happened to the rock-star locks?
you mean pi sigs don't give points for rape?
Stacy's gonna hate hearing that no good came out of friday night.
I don't give a flying nun what she thinks.
she's a total tease.
she was coming onto me all night, and then she blew me off for some other dude who called her bluff.
boohoo.
bird dog, do you want to show this young lady out?
Thanks, I know the way.
and you might want to get your clippers because unless being electrocuted counts, bird dog here never scored these 240 points.
it was 210.
you under-counted the sassy.
and this looks like it must be the pacific-islander lunch group.
now, who might be wearing a wig?
I think I'll follow a hunch.
excuse me.
Hi, I'm working on a play for the theater department, and I need to find a place that does custom wigs.
did you get yours recently, and did you get it around here?
my what? Wig?
this is my hair.
Oh...
I th
I'm sorry. I thought
Thanks, anyway.
great, a dead end, and embarrassing to boot.
excuse me.
y-you might try tori'S.
on pacific?
Thanks.
Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
it's about a girl who was raped and had her head shaved the other night.
Oh, Miss wells.
Hey, dean Harlow.
I got a message from someone saying you had some information for me, like about that guy.
I'm still waiting to hear from the sheriff.
I haven't heard anything.
I left the message.
and... I do have information.
Troy's being drawn and quartered? -No. -Then I'm not interested.
Stacy, it wasn't Troy.
he didn't rape you, and he didn't leave the box of hair.
because good old Troy's a decent, stand-up guy simply not capable of doing something so horrible, right?
because it happened to me, too...a month ago.
whoever did thiso you did the same thing to dawn when Troy was on the other side of the country.
I'm not saying it wasn't horrible or you don't deserve justice.
I'm just saying someone else did it, and that someone is still out there.
the same thing?
did he send you a box with
no.
that was a nasty little gift from a pi sig named Gordon Peters.
he was bitter because you didn't fall for his charm, and not scoring with the ladies meant getting his head shaved.
I think you'll find that hair is his.
and since you're the dean of student affairs,
I thought you might be interested.
these are some sdent affairs going on in the basement of the pi sig house.
don't think you want that getting into the hearst brochure.
well, that's it. That's the last you're gonna see of me.
the final event now is doughnuts with the dean in michael hall, and if I've done my job, you don't have to ask me where that is.
so, I hope to see you guys next year.
I hope so, too.
admit it.
Hearst ain't half-bad.
it is.
that means half of it might be good.
you talking about me again?
so, they dropped the charges.
Thanks, Veronica, real.
I'm not sure that I deserve it, but...
you're a real friend.
how about we just call me an acquaintance with reservations?
right.
then, until next time -- go, Hearst!
right.
Hey, you guys hear about the pi sigs?
Nope.
they got a semester of probation.
if it's double-secret probation, there's a serious leak.
no mixers, no parties, no sports.
and it was your photo that nailed them. You don't mess around, do you?
that's Veronica mars making friends and influencing people wherever she goes.
see, if you come here next year, you' already got enemies.
just feel right at home.
see you.
I heard you wanted to see me.
I did. I thought you might wa your hair back.
uh, I don't want that.
fair enough.
Oh, my god. What -- are you crazy? What are you doing?
what are
your dad dropped his testimony so I'd quit seeing you.
I figured.
so, did you ask me out so he'd do it?
Yes.
and you want me to forgive you?
Yes.
you're back early.
Yeah, I ditched the goodbye hugging.
can you believe it?
you? Miss hug?
so, you must be tired. Why don't you lie in your
is Keith here?
dad?
your hooker's here.
escort, honey.
so, why don't you go to your room and do your blog
whatever you ks do.
sorry about that.
so...
what do you got in mind?
a few questions to start off.
the briefcase
tell us why you took it and where it went.
well, I got the call.
I show up.
the guy offers me triple rate if I pick him up and swipe his briefcase.
so, who's the guy?
let me see. You know,
I think I've got his birth certificate in here somewhere.
no. He didn't say.
what happened to my briefcase?
I gave it to him in the garage. I split.
what he did with it, I have no idea.
so, is that it?
I guess so. But, hey, nice work.
I really thought...
it w all real.
just the welts, honey.
enough!
dad, what are you doing here?
get dressed.
get dressed! -I am.
I told you to stay away from her.
you're lucky I don't kill you.
dad, he -- -Hannah, get your things.
don't speak to her like that.
we had a deal. -Yes,"had." Now we don't.
there's nothing you can do that'll stop me from seeing her.
you want to bet?
so if you go to Hearst you can go home and do your laundry at weekend the French Revolution, boys, whatever.
I told you, dad. I am going far, far away.
it's a deal breaker.
Hearst is 10 whole exits.
what do you know about plastic explosives?
that's what I like -- a good segue.
I mean, where you get them, what they're used for.
well, if you're licensed, legitimate uses include construction, mining, demolition.
demolition.
dear Mr. Fennel, it is with great pleasure
you got the scholarship.
two times.
Hearst college, baby, here I come!
I am so over this place already.
right there with you.
Hey, did Hannah miss school today?
you didn't hear?
no.
her parents sent her to boarding school in Vermont.
she's gone.
so, the contest winner gets to push that thing
you know, that thing like bugs bunny always pushes
and the stadium explodes?
a plunger, right.
but if we did our work right, the stadium implodes.
cool.
using dynamite?
some, but c-4 mostly.
what's c-4?
not much to look at, actually, but it does the job.
and it's the exact same stuff I saw in the airplane hangar.
I told you to take that crate to section 11!
one more question
is it just a coincidence that danny boyd works here or do I now have to add the Fitzpatricks to the list of people who could have framed Terrence cook or even crashed the bus?
do me a favor and drop that knife.
you told the police you couldn't identify the guy.
I lied. -Of course you did.
how are we gonna figure out who did it?
the one that did it is in business with the Fitzpatricks.
were you dating Felix?
my uncles and cousins didn't know about us.
you killed Felix, didn't you?
before you think about spreadinit around, I think you should see something
that night you nearly kicked curly's head in.
if we did our work right, the stadium implodes.
I told you to take that crate to section 11!
is it just a coincidence that danny boyd works here, or do I add his name to the list of bus-crash suspects?
all right, citizens, the big moment has finally arrived.
one lucky student will spend a week interning at the mayor's office as his honorary deputy, and as a grand finale, this lucky patriot will push the plunger for the demolition of old shark field on saturday.
the grand-prize winner of woody goodman's freedom essay contest is...
I'm sorry, did someone say my name?
for those interested, the winning essay will be on the board all week.
freedom.
that's what it's all about.
but talking about it and being it -- that's two different things.
you came up all deliberate-like.
I figured you wanted to be first in line to ask me to the sadie hawkins dance, not recite my prize-winning essay.
neither, actually.
I'm quoting "easy rider,"
which you may remember making me watch last summer.
that's funny. It sounds a lot like my essay.
Yeah, weird.
sure, I mean, who doesn't use algebra every day of their life, man?
Felix, algebra 2?
come on.
what am I still doing even showing up here?
it's all coming back to me now.
three months till summer, then senior year.
after that, vámonos, baby.
I got to pass the deuce first.
this will be your third try, right?
how bad you want out of here? -I got to graduate.
my grams is holding on just long enough for me to cross that stage.
right.
okay, what kind of grand plans you got?
miss James gave me some info on trucking school.
them dudes make $40 an hour. You know that?
that's enough to get married, settle down, crank out a couple shorties.
wait, Felix, Felix. Hold on, doggy.
before you get all minivan on us, you got to get a woman.
you ain't had a girlfriend longer than a weekend, far as I know.
I heard the FBLA won the drawing to host the sadie hawkins dance.
dances are the best fund-raisers.
the band made, like, 3 grand at last year'S.
this face right here
my over-the-moon face.
thinking of asking some special boy?
I'm flying solo for the foreseeable future.
I'll be working it, though...
you work it, girlfriend.
...taking keepsake couples photos.
what about you?
anyone on your radar?
well, I've got a dilemma.
I'm torn between this sweet band dork and this all-hands Nubian prince.
tell me more about this band dork.
you'll lose that hand.
don't get between a man and his cake.
excuse me, guys. I believe I'm getting the nod.
I need your help.
if I had 50 bucks every ti someone said that.
look, I know it's a drag being you, and
no, seriously, I'm gonna need 50 bucks if you expect me to keep listening.
well, I'm banking on curiosity getting the better of you.
all right, tell me. Damn my curiosity!
thumper killed Felix. -Okay.
if you know thumper did it, what do you need me for?
well, I can't prove it...yet, and thumper has something on me.
there's this video on his cell.
do go on.
I didn't exactly tell you the whole truth about how I handled the curly situation.
shocker.
I think that's scout's honor. Your fingers are
not important, moving on.
which parts did you skimp on?
we did get an anonymous call
not just me, some of my boys, too
all saying the same thing
curly sent the bus off a cliff to take out cervando for hustling lee and fitzpatrick out of a few grand.
it wasn'me.
I didn't kill your friend. Those kids
that's not what I hear.
I hear you took out the bus to get cervando.
it wasn't me. I know who did it.
you told me you didn't believe rly caused the bus crash.
I don't.
but you beat him anyway? -No, I saved his life.
my boys wanted to send him off a cliff behind the road hog.
don't suppose you noticed whether curly had my name written on his hand -while you were saving his life. -No, but...
the cameo he was wearing looked a lot like you.
thumper's gonna go down for what he did to Felix one of two ways
either the law's gonna handle it, or I will.
if you want it done right, then help me get the proof.
how's your dad doing? -Fantastic.
so good, in fact, they took him off suicide watch yesterday.
banner freakin' day in the cook household, let me tell you.
is he getting better? -Slowly.
he's in no hurry. Once the doctors clear him, he moves from his guarded hospital room to a cell at county jail.
so how you doing in that great big house all alone?
the things you don't know about me.
when my mom started getting wrinkles around her eyes and she could see the end of her modeling career coming, her new career became landing a wealthy man.
single, wealthy men like to travel.
they like to party. They don't like kids hanging around.
I was pretty much alone from age 11 on.
being alone now kind of feels like being back to normal.
well, we should hang out.
even superman would leave his fortress of solitude from time to time.
I'd like that.
this is study hall.
do you two know what we do in study hall?
give me a minute. I think I know this one.
what are you doing?
no, I'm just standing here, wondering what I've done to make you ashamed of me.
it's the age thing, isn't it
you know, me and my full blush of youth and you and your advancing years.
I'm standing in the middle of the hallway holding your hand, dorkwad.
you don't really want to go to that thing.
well, you know, I'd like to be asked.
fine.
do you want to go to the big dance, cassidy?
was that so hard?
Yes.
and if the dance blows half as much as I'm guessing it will, we can cutut early and go straight for the good stuff.
Oh, my.
I'm talking about neptune's best pizza quest '06.
you, get your mind out of the gutter.
Hey, I need a second.
I'm sorry, I can't be late for my first day.
but call the county courthouse, ask for the assistant to the honorary deputy mayor.
I need you to do something for me.
Veronica, ask not what logan can do for you, but what you can do for logan.
that's gonna get old real soon.
let me know when that time comes.
until then, you know me.
I'll just be speaking softly and carrying a big stick.
God, you're a pest.
tell me everything you remember about the night Felix was killed.
you do know I've been cleared f all charges, right?
the whole dead-felix business has lost its intrigue for me.
once something stops being important to me, my memory gets a little fuzzy.
wait. Who are you?
the murder is still unsolved.
and yet, somehow, I sleep like a baby.
if Thumper did do it, he's about to get away with killing Felix, framing you, taking over the P. C.H. Bike club, and cornering the high-school drug trade.
we should invite him to speak at FBLA.
follow the bouncing ball
not my problem.
you don't remember anything about the guy who stopped and helped you -- the 911 caller?
Mexican dude driving a truck.
his truck had a bumper sticker.
it said,"how's my driving? Call 1-800-eat--" something.
Thanks. Well, run along, deputy dog.
go serve your community.
I think it was a san diego seafood truck.
I'd probably know him if I saw him.
Mr. Mendes, father fitzpatrick has blown this way out of proportion.
more law enforcement, for one.
property values will bounce back.
excuse me.
sir, your intern from neptune high school's here.
I got to run.
listen, the voters will decide, okay?
got to go.
Bev, get some guys from the newspaper over here.
me with a high-school kid-- good P. R.
lord knows I can use some.
Mr. Goodman, Logan Echolls.
it's good to meet you, sir. -Aaron's son, right?
great essay, powerful stuff.
it came from the heart.
cancel that last request I made.
all right, then.
Firsthing's first. Let's make it official.
Bev, ou got that bible handy?
your left hand, please. -Yes.
that burns.
just kidding.
I, Logan Echolls, do solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of honorary deputy commissioner of Balboa county, California.
I do.
now if you'll excuse me.
where are you going? -I'm going to fire the sheriff.
let's save personnel changes till after you've warmed up a bit.
now, I'm sure you're aware that
I've introduced a bill proposing the incorporation of neptune.
I'm glad you brought it up.
I'm backing the plan.
in fact, I'm throwing my considerable weight behind it.
I say we take it a step further and erect a wall around neptune proper
keep the riffraff out.
you want me to visit some of the local community centers, -sell them on it? -Not quite yet, but I appreciate the offer.
for now, we just need this mail separated into pro
and anti-incorporation piles.
isn't beverly here a bit more suited to this kind of thing?
I've got a letter opener you can borrow.
beats pulling the drive-through shift at Woody's burgers.
I wouldn't know
you're the one who's served 20 billion.
I believe Woody's expecting me.
Mr. Goodman, Your 4 clock is here
that's honorary deputy county commissioner echolls to you.
Keith, that you? Come on in.
Keith, I want you to drop ur other cases and focus all your energies toward clearing the greatest shark to ever put on a uniform.
Terrence broke into his ex-girlfriend's family home.
the journalism teacher who died in the bus crash
that give you pause? -Not a moment'S.
you know sething that makes you so certain?
I know the quality of his character.
there's something you gentlemen should probably see.
this DVD was in the stack of mail.
there's no return address.
that's inside my house.
I figured. Watch.
well, I don't know. All the kids at school...
Yeah, I'll look into this, as well.
so I'm guessing this goes in the anti-incorporation pile.
so this is staking out?
it looks sexier in the movies.
did you hear anything from hannah?
does deafening silence count?
you know, I'm not sure, but I think when they start shipping your girlfriends off, you're officially a bad boy.
her dad and your dad should get together and go bowling.
there he is.
excuse me.
Hi, sorry to bother you.
we were hoping to ask you about an incident we think you witnessed last may...
on the coronado bridge.
you might remember helping my friend here.
if there was an incident, I would remember it.
your route has to take you across the coronado bridge.
you got the wrong guy.
this is the guy, right? -Yeah, that's the guy.
you know my schedule?
you know where I live?
43rd and euclid.
I got P. C.H. drivers riding up and down my street day and night.
now, if I was on the bridge that night and if I saw what went down, a guy like me who's got a wife and a 5-year-old daughter might think he's better off keeping his mouth shut.
well, covering your own ass has made the last seven months of mine hell.
that's one way of looking at it.
now, here's another.
if it was me who stopped, chased off the bikers, and called 911, then I guess I'd be the guy who saved your life.
I was planning on sending a fruit basket from prison.
a rich, white son of a movie star getting convicted in neptune?
I'd say your future's safe.
you find a witness?
Yeah, I found out he's as good as no witness at all
not a big fan of the P. C.H. drivers, yeah, their popularity's really gone downhill without me.
by my count, we got bupkes.
count again.
I got another angle -- Molly Fitzpatrick.
what's she know?
the Fitzpatricks were using their plastic surgeon to pin Felix's murder on Logan.
you know what that says to me?
that we need tougher immigration laws?
no. Thumper did the deed, but the orders came from his supplier.
my guess, it was a condition of them doing business together.
why kill Felix?
a while back, I found out Felix and Molly had a thing.
it got serious -- sneaking around, talking about a lifetime of trucking their brains out.
good golly, Miss Molly.
they were in love.
Molly said if her family found out, they'd kill them both.
maybe they found out.
maybe they were told.
this serves as a preemptive apology for the conversation that's about to take place.
okay. And...
beaver a I occasionally, you know, make out.
I made out once, back in the day.
I think he had me pinned up against a woolly mammoth.
so not that I'm an expert in this sort of stuff, but four months, typical high-school boy
there should be some under-the-bra action, no?
let me consult my idiot's guide to wanton behavior.
basically you're asking me because I'm the sluttiest person you know?
"Slutty" is your word choice. Mine was "worldly."
so four months and nada? -Hand holding, kissing.
with tongue? -Some tongue.
ass grabbing?
helped me brush the dog hair off my pants once.
so this is bad, right? -Not so much bad as
it's weird. -Out of the ordinary, but not necessarily in a bad way.
okay, Veronica, I really like him, and we have so much fun together.
then don't sweat it. -Yeah, but it's weird, right?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
what's this?
it was supposed to be your future, wasn't it?
I found it in Felix's shop locker.
it must have been you Felix was talking about when he went on about driving a semi, settling down, and shooting out some rug rats.
can't say for sure, 'cause he never mentioned you by name.
it's too bad your family put him in the ground?
Fex got stabbed on the bridge.
nobody in my family s even there.
it was Logan Echolls or it was a P. C.H. driver.
it doesn't much matter to me which
same scum, different wardrobe.
you know that plastic surgeon Dr. Griffith?
Yeah. -Strange, isn't it?
that the key witness was some guy under your uncle's thumb?
what pisses me off is that I think loving you cost Felix his life.
it seems to me you never gave a damn about him.
I loved him. -No, I loved him!
and you know how you can tell?
cause I'm the one who cares enough to keep trying to find out who killed him.
did you just check that girl out?
I was admiring her sweater.
her second-skin, rack-magnifying sweater?
I love the fabric.
it would be a good color on me.
I got news for you.
there's not a bad color for you.
I think you should ask her where she got that from.
you think so?
anytime a hot girl wants to wear a tight sweater with a zipper down the middle, I'm on board.
go ask her, ask her, ask her.
hang on a sec, Wallace.
Hi, Charlie. I'm Jackie.
would you like to go to the dance with me this weekend?
Yeah. -Okay.
Hey, buddy. I wouldn't.
Hey, there.
bet I know what you need right about now.
come on. Follow me.
you mind giving me a spot?
so are you excited about the demolition ceremony?
I'm nervous, actually.
someone's gonna have to walk me through it step-by-step.
now, push down, right?
thank you.
you know, looking at you reminds me of the good old days when I was young and ripped.
bet you have some fun with the ladies?
the ones that survive.
Molly, get me a beer.
okay. Okay, you ready to lose all that legitimate paycheck?
if I was you, Liam,
I'd save that smack till I was behind the 8.
that is gonna hurt!
you hear me, girl?
bring me another beer.
what the hell's wrong with you tonight?
sorry, uncle Liam.
I just had a crap day.
come tell cousin danny all about it.
I'm just pissed off bout logan echoll he's supposed to be in jail for murder.
what happened with Dr. Griffith's testimony?
why did he lie?
since when do you give a rat's ass about Dr. Griffith or some dead biker?
just...
Dr. Griffith
I never trusted him.
you sure that's it?
you sure you're not pining...
over that ha-breed cholo?
don't call him that.
Why? It's the truth.
don't you dare cry for him.
after all the things he said he did to you?
you were his whore.
he did not care about you.
you were just a dumb blond, piece of tail he shot his mouth off about to all his buddies
how he plugged the good ship molly-pop.
shut up!
shut your mouth!
you ould be glad he's dead.
if your dad wasn't in prison, he'd have done it himself.
we take this to the sheriff, Thumper might decide he wants to show off his phone video you dispensing justice.
I'll risk it.
it'll be worth it to me to see him go down for killing Felix.
so after all this, it looks like Felix got himself killed bragging about his sex life.
thumper made it up, okay?
you want to make a guy like Liam lose his mind, call a girl in his family a whore or say that she'll let you do what
don't tell me -- lab report.
history exam. Roman history.
man, that Caligula.
sheriff will be in in a minute.
he's just running a little bit
I guess he's here.
someone took my parking space again.
Yeah, we got a letter.
the new deputy commissioner needs it.
I guess he's handicapped.
you, out.
look up Eli Navarro.
there's got to be something outstanding we can book him on.
if I did it? It's outstanding
still picking winners, Veronica?
I told you, when I start picking losers, it's all you.
we were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd drop by, solve a murder case for you.
well, bonus points for bringing the perp along.
so who's the deceased? -Eduardo Orozco killed Felix.
he's got such a cute nickname.
he is dealing on campus for the Fitzpatricks now.
here's proofhat they're working together.
Liam Fitzpatrick practically confesses to orchestrating Felix's death on this tape.
...how he plugged the good ship molly-pop.
you should be glad he's dead.
if your dad wasn't in prison, he'd have done it himself.
imagine how helpful that recording would be if it was obtained legally...
not to mention an actual confession.
note the absence of a silver platter.
this was more to steer you in the right direction than to, say, do your job for you.
actually, it was doing your job for you.
getting admissible evidence seems like the least you can do.
there's less I can do -- trust me.
an 09er could come in here with tea leaves and a ouija board, and they'd send out a S. W.A. T. Team.
it's time for plan B.
not just yet Dirty Harry.
in case you haven't noticed, ain't no mick cop.
okay. Dirty Sanchez?
just give me a few more hours.
there's a woman I can talk to, and luck might be a lady tonight.
patience ain't one of my virtues, Veronica.
you got something for me already?
I might. I need to get your input.
you'll notice when the camera passes your living-room window -that it's dark outside. -Okay.
and then here, our mystery videographer happened to get a shot of your clock.
it was approximately 5: 30 in the evening.
all right.
so what does that mean?
it means that this video had to be shot in november or december when the days were short, long before you went public with the incorporation initiative.
I think we've been barking up the wrong tree.
now, I guess my next question is...
got another tree?
can you think of another reason someone might have for wanting to rattle you?
let me think about this.
I'll get back to you. -Take your time.
sometimes these things aren't easy to recall.
it's really sweet of you to do this.
it's my pleasure.
Veronica, this is my friend Charlie and his mom.
Hey, Charlie, how did you snag the sexiest girl in school?
she asked me, and I said yes.
well, we always want the bad boys.
okay. Say,"cheeky monkey."
cheeky monkey.
Hi, welcome to the Sadie Hawkins spring fling.
enjoy.
don't worry, gang.
if she's a 2 at 10: 00, she'll be a 10 at 2: 00.
this is cool?
it would have been cooler to have, like a date, but, actually,
I'm kind of proud of myself that I came alone.
it's kind of huge for me, don't you think?
it's like I'm evolving.
Hi!
enjoy confession.
all the crepe paper in the world could not turn his gym into a garden paradise.
Hey, I'm having a moment here.
use your imagination.
I'm 17 years old, and my mom decides that last night was the perfect opportunity to give me the sex talk.
Yeah, my lecture was one word -- don't.
so, my dad likes having you at work.
he says you've got potential.
I think that was the word.
Well,"potential" was the word, but "underachiever" is the sentiment.
the demolition ceremony's gonna be fun.
are you nervous?
what if you push the plunger and nothing happens?
you mean, like, if there were total silence?
let's try to imagine it.
I'm so sorry it's time to get Charlie home.
come on, charlie. It's time to say good night.
good night. -Good night, charlie.
I'm getting thirsty.
you want something to drink? -Sure.
wait up.
Hey. You all right?
Yeah. I'm fine, why?
well, you blew out of there so fast.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
that's really sweet of you to
easy, boy. Don't you have a date?
I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
so are you saying you don't have feelings for me?
the girl you're trying to make me right now is the girl that I'm trying really hard not to be.
so knock it off.
I'm riding home with Kate.
hold up. What are you
you were kissing her. Kate saw you.
Jane, wait. Please?
look, I'm sorry. I was messed up.
she's always around you, always hanging on you.
you couldn't resist? -It was a weak moment.
look, I'm so sorry. Realy.
that was positively sucktastic.
well, the night is still young.
we could always go back to your place.
no parents to worry about.
Yeah, Dick's there.
so? Dick's always there.
Yeah, it's just
you know, I don't feel like dealing with him tonight.
if we stay in your room, then we won't have to deal with him.
of course, we still have eight stops left on pizza quest '06.
it's just
you know -- with Dick there.
for a friendship to work, you have to be completely honest, which is something I have absolutely no problem with.
but you -- you run from the truth.
only when it's chasing me
do you know what I think?
I think you use sarcasm and anger as a way to keep people from gting too close to you.
you know, I do.
but it doesn't always work.
tell me what you think about me.
seriously. Be completely honest.
dance with me.
when I dreamed of this moment,
I've had "the time of my life" was always playing.
well, what can you do?
I was going into St. Mary's to make the drop.
next thing I knew, somebody grabbed me, and I was out.
when I woke up, the cash was gone.
that baby face looks real pretty for someone who got jumped.
so, what? You got hit in the head?
no, it was some kind of a -- -he had a vulcan death grip?
Hey, Liam, take a look what I found behind the little bunny's gas tank.
well, would you look at that?
you know, Jackie...
I used to think everyone was wrong about you.
it's Weevil! I'm telling you, man!
he set me up!
he must have found out abt the church somehow.
come on, Thumper.
you got to man up.
you're gonna get yours, both of you.
I got something on you.
duct tape.
is there anything it ain't good for?
good news, Keith.
you can take that stalker video off your plate.
turns out it was my gardener -- rather my former gardener.
how'd you figure it out? -He confessed.
crisis of conscience, I guess.
my wife fired him a few months back for killing the hydrangeas.
my wife is...tough.
gardener's not a bad guy.
I promised him I'd get the dvd back.
he wants it destroyed.
you seem pretty understanding about all this.
well...
so that's it, then? -I got bigger fish.
I guess you'd be out of business if they all went this way?
so, Keith, you got that dvd?
sure.
Thanks.
now you can get back to important business, -like clearing Terrence's name. -Right.
Thanks, Keith.
Veronica -- such a good kid, coming in on your lunch period, helping your dad.
Bye, everybody. -See you, Woody.
can you hold my calls for a while?
okay, you win.
smart move talking to my wife.
just so I've got this straight, you saw one P. C.H. Er stab another P. C.H. Er and put the knife in the Echolls kid's hand?
Yeah, that's what I saw.
could you identify the guy if you saw him again?
I couldn't make out faces, but the one that did the stabbing took off on a rotorcycle with some kind of black spider on the side.
I know the bike.
sacks, issue a warrant for Eduardo "Thumper" Orozco
I want him tracked down now.
she brings it on herself.
she'd have friends if she didn't act like she's the most important person wherever she is.
Jane, Jackie didn't kiss me last night.
I kissed her.
she must have been coming on to you.
she wasn't.
I just kissed her out of nowhere.
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you, but I got to be honest.
I still have feelings for her.
I broke up with Jane.
so, are you gonna ask me to sit down?
no.
you can't sit here, Wallace.
do you not see that?
why not? I'm free now.
you know I like you.
there's nothing stopping us.
if you sit here, it proves that I'm the man-eating bitch who snatched you from one of the sweetest girls in school.
I won't have that.
now go.
please, Wallace. Leave.
is it me?
no, it's the tater tots.
are you not attracted to me?
wait, what?
why don't you want to, you know, like, do stuff?
can we please not talk about this here?
we have to talk about it sometime.
I get nervous, too.
like when we're just hanging out, 's totally comfortable and cool, but then it feels like there's all this pressure, and I don't know wt I'm doing, either.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm not saying you don't.
well, you know, it sounded like you were.
I'm saying i don't.
so if you don't either, or you feel nervous or
we have to stop talking about this.
Veronica says that all guys move at different speeds and that this could just ease
you talked veronica about me? -No. I mean
what did you say to her? -Nothing. It was more about me.
I wanted to make sure that I wasn't doing something wrong.
well, you weren't.
but you are now.
good luck getting laid.
Hi, Wood.
woody -Yeah.
one moment.
there's a motorcycle chained up inside the stadium.
it's gonna get turned into dust.
is everyone out?
we've blown the horn a dozen times. I had the boys do a walk-through.
how long would it take to unlock it and get it out?
20, 30 minutes.
then someone's losing a motorcycle.
this field has seen a long and storied history.
dad!
hurry up!
they're about to blow up shark field.
bless me, father, for I have sinned.
it's been a long, long time since my last confession.
I need you to do something for me.
it's important.
I'll come and pick up your carcass in the morning.
I'm Parker.
Veronica.
she's a one-Woman red-Light district.
Parker's in there with some guy.
don't mind me.
someone raped me!
the last thing I remember...I was at the zeta theta rush party.
I don't even remember how I got here.
I just...
I woke up, and I was all, like, out of it.
and I didn't have clothes on.
the thing about being roofied and raped
you may not remember the who, when, where, why, but you know the what.
I have "there's got to be a morning after" stuck in my head.
if I stard singing, kill me.
the rapist was there when I came into the room.
I could have stopped it.
but you didn't because I told you she was a floozy.
it's a proud, proud day for both of us.
tell me I'm here because of you.
not that i'm counting or anything, but isn't this wolf cry number two?
she's in here, sheriff.
same as the others - Head shaved.
she doesn't remember anything.
they always say that.
how are you feeling?
rough night, huh?
so, um, around what time did you get back to the dorm?
9: 00? 10: 00? 11: 00?
just give me a window.
I don't know.
it - The rape - Occurred at 11: 45, give or take a couple minutes.
we had these movie passes.
I...
came in the room to get them.
you were here?
you saw her?
the light was off. I didn't see much.
well, why the hell didn't you turn them on?
because I heard noises.
noises.
like breathing...
and buzzing.
buzzing - Like an electric razor?
Yeah, I guess, but at the time, I thought it was something else.
it turned off a second after I came in the room.
what exactly did you think the buzzing was?
something else, okay?
just...
something else.
Oh, my god.
you thought...
I thought it was just sex.
it - It didn't occur to me that it was against your will.
Thanks, Veronica.
thanks for thinking i'm the slut of the world!
you let this happen!
Parker, I can't even - I'm s- so sorry.
as long as there has been war and prisons and soldiers and orders, there has been torture.
you don't think it was invented by a handful of rednecks on the fly in Iraq.
it's always been here.
I guarantee the great George Washington and his continental army indulged in this sort of behavior with the british redcoats.
we just had to sit around a couple hundred years for someone to invent the digital camera to show us what we're really capable of.
show of hands - Who of you saw this photo from abu ghraib and thought, "I would never do that to another human being"?
|You think it's cruel and awful and unconscionable.
but guess what.
of all of you who have your hands up, only two, maybe three of you, are right.
in other dreary news, you have a 20-Page research project due at the end of the term about the effects of imprisonment and torture.
there's an alternative.
I'm conducting an intensive study on the prisoner-Guard relationship in which volunteers are assigned those roles.
if, during the 48-Hour experiment,
the guards are able to extract from the prisoners some arbitrary piece of information, they are exempt.
but if the prisoners manage to keep their secret, they are exempt.
fine. I'll sweeten the pot.
the losing team still must do the paper - Only 10 pages.
any takers?
got your message.
what you up to?
turning my unbearable guilt into steely resolve.
I think it's working.
well, you've had plenty of practice.
Yeah.
good. Done.
I'm gonna catch the rapist, see him crucified.
don't think they do that anymore.
first things first - I have an interview with the newspaper.
word is, they actually pay for photos in college.
new safety rules for the dorm.
you guys heard about last night - The rape?
Yeah, we did.
I really thought things were going to be better after the last incident, you know?
like how the safest time to fly is he day after a plane crash?
there's a floor meeting tonight, fyi.
I'm not gonna be around.
I'm doing this experiment for sociology.
Dr. Kinny?
I did the experiment last year.
it's pretty intense.
it's, like, life-Changing.
she's a great writer, but can you see her blending in at a sorority?
uh, they're not big on doc martens and unibrows.
call me back.
these are great.
this other freshman gave me 100 pictures of his grandmother sleeping.
was she hot?
no.
I'd take any assignment.
if I don't get this job, the fine people in financial aid have a completely undesirable position in the library all pi||ed out for me.
Yeah, she's picking a wedgie.
and she ain't got no alibi.
can I tell you how happy this makes me?
she t. P.'Ed my house in the 10th grade.
makes me happy, too.
welcome to the home of theta beta.
what do you think?
I think it's the gateway to hell, and I don't want to keep looking directly at it.
Veronica, I have the perfect assignment for you.
you've probably heard about the rape spree on campus.
there was another last night - A freshman girl.
her name's Parker something.
she was at a sorority party at the theta beta house.
you think the sorority had something to do with it?
you wouldn't believe the rumors about what goes on in that house.
I've been trying to find someone who could get inside theta beta during rush week,
do a "behind the greek curtain" expos?
and you want me to take pictures?
I want you to do the story.
you are exactly the type they would love to have.
you're intelligent, cute.
uh, combative, independent-Thinking, smart-Mouthed - Believe me, i'm not their type.
you'd be perfect.
trust me, Veronica...
you'll blend right in.
tasteful floral dresses"?
all my florals are trampy.
seriously, I don't have a thing with a flower that's not in the tube-Top or hot-Pant family.
couple things about theta beta
their parties are notorious - Nothing but free-Flowing booze and boys.
they're totally against school policy.
alcohol at a sorority party?
it isn't exactly sound like news.
according to reliable sources - Four of them
the theta betas get pledges all liquored up, take them to a secret room, and have them
while the guys from their brother fraternity watch the show through a two-Way mirror.
if this Parker girl was there - You had me at "secret room.
looks like you'll have a room all to yourself.
I will?
my parents are driving in from denver to take me home.
they never wanted me to go away to school.
well, my mom didn't.
she said I was too immature to be on my own.
guess she was right, huh?
it might be best, you know - To be with your family.
Yeah.
you're probably right.
what's really worse - Getting girls to undress in front of a two-way mirror
or getting them to dress like a '50s vacuum ad first?
no.
you with the sad eyes don't be discouraged, though I realize it's hard to take courage in a world...
welcome to zeta theta beta.
I'm Haley. What's your name?
Oh, my god.
I used to have a little shih tzu named Veronica.
Hey, there...
great dress.
I just need to take your purse.
I'm sorry?
don't worry.
we're not gonna steal anything.
it's a house thing.
so you ready for your first theta beta experience?
I'm trembling.
Yes, i'd like a boy, a bottle of hooch, and you can fast-Track me to the dirty room
so I can get the frak out of here.
lemonade?
worst roman orgy ever.
coming for to carry me home
I am so completely not even lying.
theta beta is the best house.
it is.
we have so much fun.
so much fun.
it's really like we're all sisters.
Oh, and Becky's father is a dermatologist, and he totally hooks us up.
you even think you're getting a zit, and you swing buy
cortisone shot, and you are golden.
and we have a tanning bed.
filler up?
Yes.
any chance this one's got a little kick to it?
sorry, no booze.
them's the rules.
but the farther you are from the singing, the less you'll crave intoxication.
last week, they tried to change the lyrics to "macarena."
I almost impaled myself on the banister.
I'm Marjorie, by the way.
Oh, with a "C."
um, what's up with the whole purse thing?
I think you'll find out soon enough.
trust, sister.
trust.
and don'let her scare you away.
love her to death, but she kind of looks at rush week as shopping for someone to borrow things from.
she's harmss.
a one-Track mind but a heart of gold.
gold? Really?
all my girls are wonderful.
Karen's our den mother.
she gets paid to say that.
truth is, we're all incredibly lame, but we're like family.
the trade-Off is you have to wear a matching dress occasionally.
see what a little ingenuity and an unused dorm wing can get you?
these are the rules of the Neptune conventions.
my t. a. and I will be close by to make sure you adhere to them.
you'll notice the cameras throughout our prison.
you'll be monitored at all times.
we should have done the paper.
it's gonna be fine.
everyone whose social security number ends in an even number, step forward, please.
you are the guards.
the rest of you are now the prisoners.
let's go over the rules.
sleep deprivation is okay.
any other kind of physical abuse is not okay.
prisoners are required to get a certain number of calories per day.
and to ensure that the food isn't inedible,
one guard must eat a sample meal before the prisoners are forced to eat theirs.
prisoners are not allowed to use cellphones, computers, watches.
well, I hope you enjoy writing your paper.
we'll never crack.
that so?
side bet?
loser streaks across campus?
I'm gonna enjoy watching you do it.
you would.
it's on.
prisoners, come with me, please.
if at any time you want the experiment to end and to just go home,
all you have to do is tell one of the guards this information.
or click your heels three times.
guards, a bomb will go off in 48 hours.
you must get the location of the bomb from a prisoner to ensure the safety of innocent people.
in exactly 48 hours - 6: 02 p.m. Sunday - The experiment will be over.
prisoners, in your cell.
in your cell!
well, I hope you're cool with this - I'm planning on calling you "nancy.
no beds.
take them apart.
put the mattresses in the guards' room.
no books, either.
chill out, man.
I've got a test on monday.
I've got to get some studying in.
fine.
tell us where the bomb is, you can go study right now.
take their books and their bags.
Hey, um, where's the bathroom in this place?
you'll all be using the bathroom together.
there will be three breaks a day, eight hours apart.
but I have to go now.
what's your name?
no.
there's no way you're that short, smell that bad, and have the last name Horshack.
how did you not kill yourself in high school?
you want to use the john?
tell me the address.
come on. You're not serious.
you know, i'm looking around...
I'm thinking the jew or the fat chick will crack first.
Hey, man...
what?
you'd rather be politically correct than prevent hundreds of people from dying?
take it seriously, bro.
you're gonna need to watch that...
bro.
sorry, man.
just playing the part, you know?
let's just do this thing, get the hell out of here, right?
cucumber sandwiches and lemonade
I'm really gonna blow the lid off sorority malfeasance.
you have been selected to attend "a special private party."
tonight, 10: 00 p.m. Dress to impress.
respectfully, your sisters at theta beta.
well, how's it hanging, my brother?
Ouch.
that looks painful.
but it doesn't hurt nearly as much as being betrayed by your own brother.
Liam - Yeah, we had a deal.
I take care of your trashy girlfriend, I get a cut of her cash.
Where's the money? I don't know!
do you know now?
look, Liam, I found some cash, but most of it is missing.
I don't know what she did with it.
you know this is gonna be the last time I ask you, right?
my money?!
it wasn't there!
I don't get it.
mom always liked you best.
I'm not exactly sure what "dress to impress" means,
but if i'm going to spend my night singing campfire songs and drinking cocoa, i'm thinking this will work.
I'm so excited you're here.
me, too.
I guess "dress to impress" meant dress like your favorite pussycat girl.
boys, booze...
panty dropper?
jackpot.
aren't you having one?
Oh, I'm having more than one.
so, what do you think?
awesome.
what do I think?
I think I'd sooner drink Mark Mcgrath's bathwater than drink anything here.
panty dropper.
the pi sigs are our brother fraternity.
they bartend for our rush parties.
they're, like, the nicest guys.
Yeah, I hear they're supersweet.
I hope you don't have a boyfriend.
there are so many cuties here.
like, newbie legacy behind you - Lost Wilson brother.
you look exactly like this chick from high school.
Oh, my god!
what are you doing here?
fulfilling my destiny.
it's a sorority party.
it's why I left the womb.
what are you doing here?
Veronica's rushing, and we love her.
somewhere in a parallel universe, bizarro dick is being a total killjoy.
Oh, you are so cute!
come on.
let's get you another drink.
this is why we take your purses
so we can leave invitations to the secret party in the dorm rooms of the girls we want to get to know better.
but we had to get creative with you.
Yeah, that's cool.
it means that anyone here had access to Parker's room.
you should meet Chip.
he's president of the pi sigs.
yeah?
this is Veronica.
tell her theta beta is the best house on campus.
this girl accused me of rape last year.
Oh, you.
God.
learn to take a joke.
just put that jalopy in the backyard so mrs. Grimley doesn't have to look at it
and I don't have to hear about it, and then everybody's gonna be fine, okay?
you okay, there, sir?
there's been a murder.
I can take you to the location.
so the question on the dance floor
how long must a girl play drunk and willing before someone tries to get her to take off her clothes?
the '70s had "the hustle."
the '80s, the moonwalk.
we have the faux-Lesbian dance.
a surveillance camera hanging over a blocked door - Yeah, that's not weird.
look, you guys, we're on tv!
if none of the guys in the room are gonna take the bait, maybe whoever's watching through this camera will.
you didn't tell me there was a camera!
come on. Come up here.
why don't you come down?
I want to show you something.
here it comes - Scary, dimly lit stairway.
they think I'm drunk...or worse.
one false move, and someone's getting a taste of mr. Sparky.
what are you showing me?
did you get a puppy?
you wanted to show me a driveway?
I think maybe it's time to call it a night, Veronica.
you're on the verge of losg points with the sisters, and you're my fave, so...
there's a safe-Ride-Home cart coming for you.
chip will wait with you, keep you safe.
Hey, this is not how I wanted my night to end, either.
I hope you're all hungry.
one of you has to eat it first.
that would be me.
these are some tasty fishes.
I can't eat this.
sure, you can.
maybe it's magic corn and you can grow to be the size of a real boy.
the best way to keep a guy at least 10 feet away - Dry heave.
vomit is the new mace.
your chariot.
you have to take her to her friend's dorm.
she's a commuter.
I don't know why I do it.
you girls get all tarted up, parade right into the belly of the beast, and drink until you can't say no.
you're lucky you didn't end up with a shaved head.
you should know better.
the greeks are evil.
okay, so here's the thing - I'm not really drunk.
so if you could just take me to the parking lot
Yeah, like I don't get that speech from everyone who sits in that seat.
no, for real.
I'm totally sober.
I was pretending for a story.
I'm on your side.
look.
hey...
you pick up any theta beta rushes last night?
I didn't.
but there are a couple of carts out each night.
backwards alphabet?
do you want me to juggle?
back handspring?
a vagina monologue, perhaps?
get out.
Thanks, sunshine.
keep on keepin' on!
hurry up!
no measuring contests.
just do your business like the dogs you are.
I don't hear anything, horshack.
you all dried up?
it's kind of hard with you yelling.
I can't pee 'cause there's other boys around!
wait a minute - Tell me you're not a hebe and a homo.
time's up!
no blood, no body.
place tore up.
looks like a robbery, not a murder.
they tore the place up looking for the victim's money.
well, if it was here, they found it.
so tell me again what you were doing out there in the desert.
Hey, sheriff.
I think I found some blood.
bag it.
let's get it back to the lab.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
come here.
Yes, I like pi
and getting caught in the rain.
get up.
get up!
mother of everything that is holy!
Hebe-O wet his pants.
I have sweat pants in my bag, rafe.
sit down, prisoner.
that's awesome.
what are you doing?
you nearly scared me to death.
I'm sorry.
why are you sitting there in the dark?
and while we're at it, why didn't you call and tell me you were going to be home a day late?
backup was worried sick.
come on. You can tell me.
you've got a girl stashed somewhere, don't you?
Hey.
what's wrong?
I screwed up, Veronica.
I screwed up, and someone got hurt.
I know exactly how you feel.
pigs' knuckles.
yum.
I can't eat that. It's pork.
and your mother was a pig?
I keep kosher.
I don't get that.
I mean, why won't your kind eat pork?
it's not like it's expensive.
where did you get those?
I'm not asking you again.
I'm not telling you.
well, then, you're going to solitary.
you can sit in there all curled up in the dark and pretend you're hiding from the germans.
no, I think the first one was better.
it wasn't, honey.
mom!
I just - I think it's more me.
you should have something simple that doesn't draw attention to you.
everyone is gonna know it's a wig, anyway.
what do you think, Mac?
see, this is exactly what i'm talking about.
you can't make a decision for yourself.
this is why you never should have gone away to college.
you're too immature.
once your father gets his pound of flesh at the dean's office, we're taking you home.
it all sounds suspicious, but you got to find out what's behind the door with the camera.
Marjorie, the cool one - Trust me, Veronica, none of them are cool.
she left me a voice mail checking in on me, suggesting I curtail my drinking.
it just doesn't exactly sound like the advice she'd give if they were trying to get me to strip in front of the pi sigs.
four sources, Veronica - Something bad is going on in that basement.
marjorie also said they were voting tonight at 7: 00.
that's when i'll make my move.
great.
they sent me home in a safe-Ride-Home cart.
if they sent Parker home the same way, maybe the driver knows something.
or maybe the driver took advantage of the situation.
I have a friend who volunteers at take back the night.
Hey, it's Nish.
question - Do you guys keep records of who you take home?
want to know the day you're the least safe at Hearst?
today.
why didn't you tell us you drove Parker home the night she was raped?
if I understand correctly, you drove Parker home.
she must have been totally out of it.
she was.
she was hammered.
and you come in Wallace's room the next day, dropping off new rape-safety rules,
and you don't mention you were the one who put her to bed?
I didn't know Parker was the girl who got raped.
if I knew, I would have gone to the police or something.
biscotti?
no.
and what exactly would you have told the police?
whatever they asked.
I didn't do anything wrong, Veronica.
she was fine when we left.
"we"?
there was another girl in the cart.
she wasn't drunk or anything.
she just took the cart so she didn't have to walk alone.
Parker was so out of it.
she helped me take her upstairs.
what was her name?
Guten Morgen.
hats off, man.
what?
I would have cracked.
I almost did already, but would you believe, I forgot the damn address.
it's the corner of 116th street and jameson boulevard.
it's 114th and jamestown.
no, it's 116th.
and it's Jameson, like the liquor.
he's right.
it's 114th and jamestown.
maybe you could say it a little bit louder next time.
I was agreeing with you, jerk.
Moe's alibi checked out.
teri Wells, a sophomore R. A. in clark hall,
confirmed that she and moe dropped Parker off at her room
and that by the time she left moe, it was midnight.
so it's back to theta beta
figuring out what the deal is with the mystery room and hoping it'll give me some clue to what happened to Parker.
here you go, Veronica.
Thanks.
I'm ju so embarrassed.
I'm really not usually like that.
we all have our moments, Veronica.
lord knows I have.
I just know they're not gonna vote for me now.
they may surprise you.
my girls are excellent judges of character.
I really like it here, and marjorie...
you know, you can't talk to the girls before the vote, but I can.
So...the surveillance-Camera monitor is in the den mother's room?
what exactly is going on here?
just looking for the trash.
well, you can relax now.
I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Psst!
I do declare, that was the finest frito pie I believe i've ever tasted.
Oh, finally - My conjugal visit.
Mmm, let me guess - You're out on good behavior?
no.
you all know my girl, Veronica.
I have your picture hung in my cell.
gets me through the long, lonely nights.
I lend it to my buddy Horshack sometimes - Hope you don't mind.
it's good to share.
Yep.
well, have a seat.
we're waxing nostalgic over our time on the inside.
Mmm, I can't.
you're breaking out.
I'm breaking in.
Star-Crossed.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
getting a jump-Start on the freshman 15?
you can't hear six people jump out of a window?
we're gonna lose this now, and it's on you two.
now, with the zeta theta sisters all off somewhere voting, time to see what's in the mystery room.
holy smokes.
Un-Freaking-Believable.
this is awesome, Veronica.
Thanks.
and the secret parties with the booze and dudes?
we're talking one greek house down, nine to go.
Yeah, you know, they weren't all bad.
you're gonna be a real asset to us here, Veronica.
you're one of us now.
how are you not peeing?!
you downed an entire big gulp at the food court, and now you can't go?!
what is wrong with you?!
it's 114th and jamestown.
dude!
only 10 hours to go, and you caved!
leave him alone.
we need to talk.
about what?
Karen has cancer.
she saw you go into her private room.
there's a second camera inside.
what were you looking for?
the truth?
if it's not too much to ask.
a friend - Someone I know - Was raped after she left a theta beta party.
I thought there might be a clue behind that door.
what's behind that door has nothing to do with the rape of Parker Lee.
so the pot farm...
Karen was so sick from the chemo, she spent the day laying on the floor in front of the toilet.
we got her a dog bed so at least she could lay on something soft.
this botany-Professor friend of hers gave her some seeds.
he said it would help with the pain and the nausea, and it did.
she won't just lose her job over this, Veronica.
she'll lose her insurance.
plea don't say anything about what you saw.
I held out as long as I could, guys...
really.
come on.
give the guy a break.
you rang?
we have the address - 114th and jamestown.
Congratulations.
you managed to get false information.
call me again when you get accurate intel.
D'oh!
solitary - Now!
I don't know how you did this, but I know this was you.
nish, it's Veronica.
listen to me - You can't print that story.
I made a huge mistake.
what mistake?
their den mother has cancer.
she's growing marijuana for medical reasons.
she got the seeds from a botany professor who was trying to help her.
and the party?
the underage drinking?
look, can you just give me a day so I can verify some facts?
as far as i'm concerned, the facts are here.
the article's being published, Veronica.
you should be proud.
Karen, i'm so sorry.
there's going to be an article in the school newspaper tomorrow.
you need to get rid of the marijuana before it comes out.
you want to know the definition of "ironic"?
you got voted in, Veronica.
we wanted you to be one of us.
I left you a card with, like, my numbers and stuff, if you want.
I thought we were gonna have a blast together.
now everything's ruined.
don't go.
nothing's ruined.
but I think if you go with your parents, it will be.
||Ay here.
I'll have your back from now on.
thank you, Mac.
Yes!
Omar, now that it's over, you got to tell us what that address was.
no.
it's 116th street and jameson boulevard.
stick that in your trophy case, baby.
congratulations, guards.
you've won.
what are you talking about? It's 6: 03.
it's 5: 45.
the two guards who fell asleep on duty were just pretending.
they waited for the prisoners to escape and then moved the clock forward.
see you in class.
and you didn't tell me?
we were counting on you to act like a jerk.
way to sell it.
I'm not acknowledging that.
look at my dedicated college student.
knowledge is power.
Nietzsche?
MNH - "Schoolhouse rock.
here's the knowledge I've accumulated my first week at Hearst
chip Diller seems to be around when the rapes occur, the safety of the safe ride home is questionable,
and someone in the theta betas had the keys to Parker's room the night of her rape.
it's a start.
van gogh's "two lovers."
do you have any idea how much this is worth?
millions.
I need you to do something for me.
sorry, mrs. Casablancas, but i'm meeting my daughter in an hour.
I think you'll change your mind.
papers are in orde|| proceeds from the sale to go to the south neptune food bank.
are you sure?
Yeah, i'm sure.
Hey, Horshack.
morning, wallace.
good news - Looks like rafe isn't showing up today.
Yeah, he's feeling a cold coming on.
he ask|| me to take notes for him.
and you're doing it?
Yeah.
I mean, all that stuff this weekend was just a game.
he's a cool guy. He just likes to win.
if you say so.
Hey, where's Logan?
Oh, we'll be seeing him real soon.
so...
what did we learn from our little experiment this weekend?
let me hear from one of the participants?
Oh, my god.
that happens to me all the time.
so it looks like my work-study job will be in the library,
my journalistic career over before it even really began.

what are you after?
the end of my client's career? -l'm just doing my job.
Sibaud replaces me, badmouths me. . . .
change your tone of voice.
two governments trusted me.
and you've abused that trust. -ln what way?
you know as well as l do.
the commissions.
l can't check everything.
but l can.
lt's not that simple.
lt's not that hard.
ln macroeconomics, there are different sectors.
ls that so?
back to reality, l'll tell you what l think.
l think you shamelessly used your situation for your personal enrichment, to benefit your family and friends.
not true and grotesque. lt shows you don't know me.
my family knows the value of hard work!
l didn't go to a big school.
l rose through the ranks, thinking only of my profession.
at least, you left patriotism out of it.
that's you , isn't it?
who is she? -My former assistant.
l'll be more precise.
she's your former mistress, whom you made your assistant.
that dress looks nice on her.
how much is she wearing? -How much what?
the dress, the jewelry. . . . do you know what it all costs?
no. Why?
you dress her from head to toe, you wine and dine her, and you don't know the cost?
good thing l'm here.
here's a statement of all the bills paid with the company credit card.
this is absurd! -You're telling me!
lf l may, Madame. Regarding the company credit card. . . .
you know as well as l do that it's an old custom.
the private sector has bonuses and stock options.
the public sector compensates with the company card for minor expenses.
may l keep this? -Sure, if you like.
may l have a glass of water?
of course.
but first answer my question , Mr. Chairman.
how do you justify these expenses?
your group, as l recall, was founded after the war to ensure France's economic independence, the hub of this independence being francophone markets.
jacques Sibaud, does your recent nomination imply a new direction?
most likely a new identity.
governments come and go, structures remain.
who is this jerk? -Sibaud.
not so " beau. "
could you hit the switch?
what are you doing? -Changing bulbs.
the others were dead? -l think they were about to blow.
your mom called with congrats. -l know. She called me on my cell.
and what do you think?
do you know my new name at the lab?
no. What?
can't you guess?
l answer riddles all day long.
l guessed.
shoot. -Mr. Jeanne Charmant-Killman?
that's stupid.
totally stupid.
lt's really. . . . stupid.
what do you think?
l think it's funny.
me, too.
he's edgy. lt happens every time l'm on a big case.
take a vacation , go relax somewhere.
you think that's the answer!
a slacker's idea, right?
l'll say no more.
ls this the family silver? -A wedding gift from your grandma.
knives only. No surprise. She hated me.
do they cut well , at least? -Not like they used to.
sharpen them.
can you take off my glasses? They're fogged up.
you approve of these frauds lining their pockets?
lt's only normal. Fraud has to be profitable.
Humeau dipped in the till. lt's easy to produce the figures.
you could do better. Where do the knives go?
ln the drawer.
do better?
put the knives away right.
that group has often been accused of bankrolling friendly heads of state or opposition leaders, sometimes both.
that's the real scandal. -First things first.
l can't play the bull in the china shop.
what's surprising is that your pal Sibaud. . . .
Oh , please!
he went after his predecessor.
that's unusual in such a big corporation.
you're right. So he winds up in court.
they expect that to keep me busy. Wrong.
when a door opens, l go in.
who is " they " ?
l'll tell you when l find out.
first, l'll get Humeau to confess.
he can't handle prison. lf he wants out. . . .
hello.
this is for you.
have a nice day.
lt's time.
out you go.
you have 1 0 minutes.
so l'm free?
l wouldn't know.
1 0 minutes.
could you hand me that pair of clean pants?
get them yourself.
why are you staring at me like that?
you want tickets to Disneyland?
hello.
are you busy, my dear?
no, no.
l hear you're on the warpath.
you could say that.
l just wanted to wish you the best on your saint day. Am l right?
that's sweet, Jacques. No one else remembered.
Really?
are you free for lunch any time soon?
l've got amusing stories for you.
you're putting me on the spot.
l'd love to, but it's not very orthodox.
of course, if you look at it that way. . . .
let me finish with Humeau. . . .
certainly. l'm unforgivable.
and l know you're a stickler for principles.
l just hope you wrap it up soon.
l'm doing my best.
l have to go. My customer is here.
thanks again. See you soon.
see you soon , Jeanne.
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
l brought you here to check a few things.
are these plantings recent?
fairly recent.
53 orange trees and 29 lemon trees. You do have the invoices, right?
that's why you brought me out? -lt wasn't to get some fresh air.
take these handcuffs off, please. -Not until l check a few things.
Nicole Humeau?
Why? What time is it?
justice Charmant-Killman.
lt's 9: 30 a. m. and l have a search warrant.
don't worry, darling.
are the kids home?
they're asleep. They got in late.
we won't search their rooms.
l don't see your suits or shoes. Don't you live at home?
sorry if your husband leads a double life.
this is vile. -You don't say.
you're vile.
my husband lives here. He always dresses casually.
ln photos, he always wears a suit. Never the same one.
not to mention the shirts, ties, cufflinks.
a vast choice for telling time.
an Omega, two Cartier. . . . a must!
company gifts.
you don't say.
my husband did nothing wrong.
his colleagues, other CEOs, influential politicians, all expressed their support.
he has an admirable wife, in any case.
back to the courthouse.
so, no tree nursery invoice.
now, this flat where you set up your mistress, 5830 sq. ft. in the most expensive part of town.
do l give you the price?
l didn't buy the flat. You can't prove it. You're bluffing.
l'm bluffing and you're lily white.
next question. -l won't answer.
l'll wait for my lawyer.
he's on his way. Sit down.
l can't sit still! l'm ill , you know!
the ball's in your court.
some people have done much worse than l have.
those who back you? -l never said that!
why are you hounding me?
to set an example, once and for all.
you won't come out too badly.
and it will do the nation good.
you know what l think?
tell me.
there's hot coffee in the kitchen.
this year we'll rent a house on the beach.
we'll be happy.
we'll be. . . .
what did you use to say?
visible for each other. -That's right.
visible for each other. ls Felix home?
he just got in.
he spent the night out.
Really?
look what l found in a drawer.
this really takes us back.
remember? l made this in a jiffy out of nothing.
you could always make things in a jiffy out of nothing.
you don't lack talent.
what do l lack?
l'll tell you some day.
see you tonight.
see you tonight.
l don't intend to smear their leaders.
still, the interrogations and indictments keep coming.
michel Humeau's in a bad way.
l don't intend to intimidate or destabilize anyone...
l hear you there, see you here!
turn it off. l can't stand it.
so, you spent the night out?
to my great benefit.
what's that?
poker. l cleaned a few people out.
lt won't hurt them , as my aunt says.
you intend to earn a living playing poker?
get angry. l love it.
how about lunch , a place with good wine?
quick, then. l'm seeing bigwigs at 2: 00.
what are they doing?
playing soccer.
only 12? They don't have enough players.
l'd better fix that.
l'll show you his cell.
lsn't that what you wanted? -Absolutely.
when you're used to 5 stars, it's a little barren.
that's an understatement.
who is in charge of keeping the place clean , warden?
we had it repainted not long ago, but we're short on funds.
ah , funding problems!
beware of lawyers.
they tend to slip in treats during their visits.
do a search after each visit.
that's just what we try to do, Madame.
the other cells are identical.
that's worrying!
so, who won?
no one. We play for fun.
then enjoy!
l don't have a Swiss bank account. l have no foreign accounts.
you're not taking it down? -Your lawyer's not here.
why isn't he here? -Ask him when he arrives.
that doesn't mean we can't chat.
how about those huge commissions you've always paid left and right?
the Herod file.
ls the sum right?
could be. lt's common currency in our business.
common currency.
a charming term, but not for the Revenue Court.
lt seems you shamelessly squandered state funds.
how can you say that? l brought in huge sums.
the payments l made enriched the group and the nation.
and yourself as well. Using front men.
all because of a woman.
but you loved her?
we broke up, you know that.
you'd be the only one not to know.
she's an ocean away.
an ocean away, in a sumptuous flat you bought her, overlooking Central Park.
she wrote you a letter. Shall l?
please, don't.
she's thirsty for blood.
she's a compulsive liar, and she's jealous, you see?
see what?
l was crazy about her. l gave her everything.
then virtually overnight. . . .
what happened?
l don't know.
my desire for her died.
you got hot for something else?
here's what she cost you:
swimming pool vacuum , latest model.
4,000 euros.
swimming pool , 50,000 euros.
not including the pool-house and spa, which she had moved.
two spas, two drillings.
but l don't mean to scare you.
all from the group's coffers.
you know how many people earn minimum wage in France?
you know this man?
are you on good terms?
he's a politician. Politics isn't business.
some people think so.
got a bone to pick?
absolutely not. He does as he wishes.
he dumped me, like the others did.
what others? -Those l did favors for.
they answered to you? They dumped you , too?
they all dumped me.
lsn't that how it goes?
lt's that prison. . . .
you should hear the screams at night.
the new guys, the young ones. . . .
as soon as they get there. . . .
they're in for it.
not in the VlP block, l hope.
l've had it.
l can't take anymore.
l can't take anymore.
l'm exhausted!
l need treatment!
l do what l can , try to keep busy, but l can't take anymore.
please, l'm begging you.
l'm begging you.
okay, permission for outside hospitalization.
don't worry about it. l still have work to do.
l'll do room 220, then. -Okay.
l won't be long.
good night, Madame.
you can do my office now. -Thank you.
Hello?
christ almighty!
what?
was it an accident?
christ almighty!
what is this? What moron thought that one up?
lt could be just an accident.
looks more like a fuckup than an accident.
what a bunch of clowns we're surrounded with!
ls she badly hurt?
according to my sources, no.
pathetic.
pathetic!
let's go. She's starting again.
they said you were unconscious, they'd sedated you , but that it's not serious.
l know all that.
you never know when to quit. You work like a lunatic.
you fell asleep at the wheel. lmagine!
l imagine very well.
l think they rigged my brakes and steering.
don't be silly. You were just tired.
get me some hot chocolate.
l'm craving hot chocolate.
l can worry, can't l? We have the right to live normally.
you're out of luck with me, honey. l'll never give up.
they won't get away with this, believe me.
you're crazy. -Maybe, but l'll go all the way.
l'll let you rest.
l'll be back later.
you're sweet to visit. -l love hospitals.
your hot chocolate? -Black, no sugar.
what a gorgeous bouquet! We'll ask for a vase.
l'll get one. Black, no sugar.
Thanks, sweetie.
who are the guys outside?
my bodyguards.
so you won't worry.
you're hard on him. -Me, hard?
l don't think so.
l was thinking earlier. . . . do you have a picture of your son?
l've never even seen him.
he's awfully cute!
how old is he? -Three.
why don't you bring him over? -He's always with his saintly mother.
Yes, and so? -l'm not wild about saints.
me neither.
l'm in good company these days!
could you get me the papers over there?
do you want your glasses? -Yes, please.
Thanks.
boy, he doesn't waste any time.
l get it now! lt was him.
who? -Humeau.
l let him out for first-class care, and he has my car rigged.
and l wind up in the hospital , too.
why him?
he was weird the last time. He didn't scratch.
he gave me shifty looks. He was plotting it.
you're paranoid. -Maybe, but l don't think so.
Humeau's an underling. -That would surprise me.
lt surprised him to be the tree that hides the forest.
what forest? -The one growing silently.
l've had a feeling all along. l hate to say it, but l know them.
the big scams are elsewhere.
l'll haul them all in.
right-hand men , coworkers, advisors.
they haven't seen the last of me.
but. . . .
why do you think they gave me those bodyguards?
well chosen , aren't they? Strong , impressive.
they're looking after you. -To throw me off track?
lf they're smart, and some are, they'll take extra-good care of you.
l'll take advantage of it, believe me.
come in.
aren't you spoiled!
who brought that? -Some florist.
l've been outdone. Shall l open the card?
sure.
jacques Sibaud. There's a note.
l told you he was a part of it. -Of course! You think l'm stupid?
did you send those flowers to charming Mrs. Charmant?
you're sure she got them?
always send flowers to the unfortunate.
you plan to let her go on with this?
l think we should use the promotion ploy on her.
there's no promotion possible.
l didn't say, " Give her a promotion , " but " Use the promotion ploy. "
come to think of it. . . .
they're supposed to move from the courthouse to a new building.
perfect!
ls it spacious?
there's lots of room.
she'll have a large office.
that's always appreciated.
she also asked for an assistant.
good idea.
after this incident, and with all those cases she has to deal with. . . .
but we mustn't end up with two snoops instead of one.
got any women in stock?
why a woman?
because women love to do dirty tricks to other women.
'Justice Charmant promoted. . . . "
how big is the new office?
lt's a surprise.
can we help? -You must be joking.
we worked well here, didn't we, Benoit?
this is from everybody here.
how sweet.
lt was a toss-up with " Aubade " but we chose " ln Love Again. "
smells nice. You made the right choice.
thank you.
they're all expecting you. What flight are you taking?
none.
l'll send it all by email. Holeo will stand in as usual.
that's his job, and he loves hot weather.
very well , Mr. Chairman.
Yes, Mr. President.
experts are already assessing the project.
lt's too early to say. These are high-risk countries.
naturally, l'll gladly make the trip.
l just cancelled my flight on Holeo's insistence.
l'm on top of it all.
thank you.
good-bye, Mr. President.
l've been thinking of you too, Jacques. Quite often.
you once said the only goal in life is excellence.
l'm trying to be a worthy disciple.
Yes.
the Presiding Judge is here
but. . . .
l'm very busy these days, and l need to get my bearings.
l'm sure you're running the show just fine, but l miss our lunches.
so when you have a minute, call. lt won't take all night.
l'll leave you to your territorial stake-out.
one more thing.
that black suit looks great on you.
l'm so glad to see you.
thanks for putting me here. lt's sumptuous.
big enough? -Almost too big.
and the design is superb.
so are you. You look great. -l feel great.
Hello, Mr. President. -Hello. . . . Benoit, right?
as loyal as ever? -Yes, sir.
glad you like it. -You know me. lt's all ready to go.
can you find your way in this maze? -With my eyes closed.
l want a word with you outside. -Certainly.
you'll be glad to hear you're no longer working alone.
l've assigned you someone.
she has plenty of experience, especially with politicians.
'she " ? who is she?
l'll introduce you.
what do l care about this trivia?
question me about my international role.
about how you fleece friendly nations?
or fund parties?
you're obsessed. Let me tell you. . . .
excuse me a minute.
Erika Eymard. Jeanne Charmant. My two favorite judges.
we're on the same floor.
how long have you been here? -She just arrived.
adjoining offices will make communication easy.
René Lange is mine. l'll continue what l started.
we can share him. You want to sink him , so do l.
sink those who think they can swim.
great. l'm going back in. -Work hard. l'll see you later.
l work alone. Why didn't you warn me?
l need you both.
you'll suit one another. lt's good for the image of justice.
lt's not the image of justice l care about. lt's justice.
good evening. -Good evening , Madame.
Madame Killman!
ground floor or parking lot? -Ground floor.
by the way, l didn't ask to work with you.
l figured as much.
but l agree with you , it's not clear. Someone thinks we'll hurt each other.
that's what l think.
we'll prove them wrong , that we're equal to them.
we'll get those machos by the balls.
see you tomorrow.
'we'll get those machos by the balls! "
'see you tomorrow. "
alone today? -My colleague's at your place.
may l? -Thanks.
don't mind me. Everything's fine.
l'll be back in two hours. -Fine.
l owe you one.
what are you doing here? Philippe isn't home yet?
not yet.
l've had your keys for three weeks. They're on the kitchen table.
l'm exhausted!
we moved today.
they stuck you in a closet?
not at all. A sumptuous new office.
lt's very nice.
like everyone, l read about your promotion.
lt worried me.
me, too.
lt smells fishy, but l'll show them.
do you like your apartment?
great! l call it " Flat Out " .
l need some tea, or l'll collapse.
want some tea? -No, thanks.
tea!
they're nice, but there's no privacy. -l have nothing to hide.
what's this about crosswords?
tea's a good idea after all. Want some?
l devise crosswords. lt's fun.
l've being cranking them out for ages.
l have a daily, 2 weeklies, and 3 pseudonyms.
and , of course, three casts of mind.
l work when l want, and l'm having fun.
make any money? -Enough.
any time for your son? -Sure.
ls your case going that badly?
no, but the situation is annoying.
they stuck me with an associate.
do you know who did it?
officially, Martino, the Presiding Judge.
l've known him for years.
a nice guy. l doubt it was his idea.
lf only l could flush them out of their holes!
the creeps!
with a little luck and lots of grit. . .
what's your colleague like? -Hard to tell.
she's nice enough , young , competent.
she has a good reputation.
pretty?
l suppose. Depends what you like. You want me to introduce you?
lf it will help, l'm all yours.
l'm going to betray a judicial secret.
tomorrow l have to play my cards right.
l'm questioning Holeo. You know who he is?
he's a head honcho.
friends with everyone. Old playboy type. Got any cookies?
as you must know, Madame, our group makes all sorts of investments.
major companies use our services.
there are three or four hundred of them.
you misunderstand , Mr. Holeo.
l mean your special relations in countries where the group has interests.
l fail to see the connection with your investigation.
l just want to make sure you're not behind the disappearance of large sums of money.
that again!
Mr. Humeau , the former CEO, had several audits done.
he found nothing wrong.
he chose to ignore it. You know where he is now.
but. . . .
there are several foreign accounts in your name, Mr. Holeo.
perhaps, but they're not mine.
l simply manage them. l'm a middleman.
for whom?
no one in particular.
certain sums transit through those accounts.
to whom?
that depends.
there are all types of subsidies.
l know that, and oddly enough , some subsidies look like kickbacks.
you overvalue an operation , then help yourself.
so l'm asking you , who is the money for?
what money? -You don't remember?
l must admit, l don't.
do you remember him?
Delombre? Sure.
he smokes cigars in the morning. lt's very unpleasant.
how well do you know him?
l know he works hard.
but our activities are completely unconnected.
things are very compartmentalized with you , Mr. Holeo.
where is Delombre hiding?
l couldn't say. All l know is he wanted to take a vacation.
you think he's basking in the sun?
l advise you not to do the same.
l don't intend to, Madame.
you also know Mr. Boldi? -Yes, of course.
l suppose your activities are also unconnected.
Yes, of course. They're unconnected.
thank you. l won't keep you. Please sign your statement.
of course l might. . . . ln fact, l probably will question you again.
don't go too far.
Holeo will talk. He's petrified.
any headway with Lange?
none. l'm afraid he's way down the totem pole.
give me one more shot with him.
no, keep him. l'm pulling on another thread.
Benoit, did you listen to us on the radio last night?
sure.
was it good? -As usual , Madame.
was l good , too? -Very good , Madame.
lt arrived this morning. lt's a letter of denunciation.
again? lt never ceases to amaze me.
Humeau's babe. -l recognized her. But why you?
to save you work. -But l'm interested!
l like Humeau.
let's go check out the slut's flat.
up for it? -lt will be a nice change.
you're still here?
orders, sir.
sorry.
come to bed. What are you doing?
this can't go on.
you hear me? -l hear you.
l hear.
what you say and don't say.
lt's my job.
you're investigating me? What's in my head?
you don't give a shit about anyone. That's the truth.
are you nuts? -Either they go or l go!
they protect us. Spare me your fantasies.
you're perfect.
smooth as stone.
who do you think l do this for?
for who?
sure, don't answer. lt's much easier.
the ivory tower.
that's your mother's stare. You've become a stranger.
so have you.
we're shadows who sometimes meet in a guarded flat.
who am l to you? Do you know?
stop playing with your wedding ring.
take it off, if it bothers you.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
do you know what you're doing? Do you know?
this is your house.
lt's your house, so l'm leaving.
let's go.
do you want me to drive? -No, it's okay.
where to, Madam?
where to?
the office, as usual.
lt's 4 a. m.
Yes.
let's go to the office. Where else?
get down!
all clear.
you can get up, Madam.
sorry.
dle BlTCH -You okay? -l'm okay.
where did you find that? -ln the clerk's closet.
did you find what's missing? -How can l , in that mess?
here, this is real coffee. -That's sweet.
l called the agency.
they have a 7 00 sq. ft. rental nearby.
too big. l just need a studio.
we'll find you one.
good morning.
you're already here? -lf you only knew, Benoit.
thanks for everything. Now l have work to do.
you'll manage? -l may not look it, but l'm strong.
we'll find you a flat.
looking for a flat?
that's my coffee maker!
l never handled commissions.
so, l don't know about suitcase sizes. . . .
don't play with me, Mr. Holeo. lt's beneath you.
so, how did the money move around?
l have no idea.
l talk with leaders, to find out what they want.
now l get it, you do the haggling.
the chit-chat.
down there, a good chit-chat means a good deal.
you chew the fat to make a deal for the group.
different customs.
how do the secret funds work?
that's what you call it.
they're funds made available by heads of state.
lt's normal. lt's the same everywhere.
some are transferred to various organizations, usually charities, or organizations that help themselves.
great, in countries where you can die of appendicitis!
l deplore it as much as you do. Believe me, l'm sincere.
excuse me.
could we postpone this interview?
l'm not well. l have heart trouble.
of course. My clerk will see you out.
there's no need.
thank you for your kindness. -l don't want to kill the sinner.
l was awful. -You're tired.
Marco told me about last night. Never a dull moment!
did Holeo break down? -lt's rather me who broke down.
he's tougher than he looks.
he did the dying man number. -Everyone knows he's sick.
we located Delombre.
where? -The Caribbean.
we'll have to forget him for the moment.
l'm so tired , l don't give a damn.
Marco told me you're flat-hunting.
lt's none of my business, but you can stay at my place in the meantime.
sorry, gentlemen. A flat tire.
just my luck. l'll go wash my hands.
why did they put this one in charge?
l preferred Michel , but Sibaud has certain qualities.
be serious, Boldi. He's as stiff as a board.
they'll soon pay him off with a pad of stock options.
what a shame!
a flat, the one time l drive. -How unfortunate!
champagne? -l would love some, Boldi.
how did it go with the judge? -Your girlfriend?
l cut our conversation short. l wanted to see you first.
did you read the rants of our friend Humeau?
you have my complete trust.
l'll talk to the press, too.
that's kind of you , but l wanted to say. . . .
l believe you've offended our friends.
they would have preferred you to go down there.
you can't settle everything via your computer, Mr. Chairman.
don't worry, old man.
l know what l'm doing. -Taittinger!
we're spoiling you.
l can see that.
did Jean-Baptiste tell you about the ClA?
Yes, the ClA was there.
everyone was, in fact.
look, l know what l say.
and l know what l'm doing.
nice of you to visit!
good timing. -As usual.
what's the box? -l'll explain.
smaller than my place, but nice. -Enough for me.
you didn't like your friend's place? -Sure, she's sweet.
but a week was enough. So what's the box?
l don't know. lt came two days ago.
philippe asked me to bring it to you.
how is he doing?
not too cheerful. lt's understandable.
where do you stand with him?
nowhere. l'm waiting.
l won't force him to take the first step, and yet. . . .
what do you think?
l don't want to interfere.
guess who it's from? Jacques Sibaud.
he's bullshitting me.
no, he's not.
he's backing Holeo. He still trusts him.
he's just trying to use me. l'll send back his wine.
don't do that. l'm thirsty all of a sudden.
we'll see. Anyhow, he's late. l had Boldi arrested.
you did? He's in jail? -Yes, he is.
while they plot behind my back, l'm pulling out the heavy artillery.
look.
lsn't he cute?
you're right. They'll be careful.
l've gone into high gear.
you know, Boldi. . . .
he's the kickback king.
lf it's done right, it's overhead and tax deductible.
or in a Swiss bank where names become numbers.
that's what l'm after. The names behind the numbers.
they'll never let you poke around. Too risky.
l have certain powers, you know.
the powers you're granted. -l don't care.
l know l can smoke the poachers out of the woods.
what are you looking at?
you. l'm looking at you , and listening.
you look like a shrink. Try it. You'd make a mint.
you're nuts.
l'd spend my day on the couch. Snoozing , of course.
what a shame.
you're the only one l can talk to. l can't with others.
l can't give you much.
l'm not asking for anything. l just need you to listen.
okay, but l'm thirsty. -Shall we open a bottle?
you're nuts! lt needs to rest at least two weeks.
l'll take you to the local bar.
you're a good boy.
lf politics involves pressing on soft spots, you have to expect turbulence.
this judge is impossible.
she doesn't get the rules of the game.
when you know how she started!
how?
as a student, she boarded with the Charmant family.
l heard she cleaned their house.
must have done right, since she married the son.
a successful takeover. -She moved out.
she rented a studio.
how do you know? -l just know.
anyway, l'm sick of her snooping around.
we didn't expect Sibaud to be useless.
he's totally inflexible. He can't move his ass.
l hope the others hold out. The natives are up in arms.
have a seat. My colleague will take your statement.
here we go, sir.
the last act.
we can't reach your wife. ls that normal?
my wife?
you can talk with your mouth full , Mr. Boldi?
lt's to quit smoking.
no, thanks.
tell me, Mr. Boldi , does an envelope of $800, 000 ring a bell?
madam , money is the oil you use to grease the gears so that the market runs properly.
an envelope of $800, 000. . . .
lt doesn't mean a thing.
lt's peanuts!
l put myself in your shoes.
all this work, all these files, these thousands of pages.
and l'm told you keep office hours at the courthouse on weekends, as well as your time in court.
l wonder how you manage.
answer my questions, and l'll tell you.
frankly, l admire you.
l've thought it over.
never mind a change of cell. l want to get out.
l understand. Prisons aren't up to snuff.
understand me, Mrs. Charmant.
l wouldn't want to be taken for a ride.
l don't intend to take you for a ride, Mr. Boldi.
my power lies in my address book.
big deal.
l know them all. They've all been indicted.
Delombre hasn't. He's on the run in the tropics.
the party funding , that's him.
not to mention. . . .
a lot of other things.
that's why he's lying low abroad. Official secret.
does Sibaud know?
he knows.
without knowing , even though he does know.
he's the one with signature power.
so he gives his trust.
he doesn't look, he just signs.
he forks out like everyone. . . .
or else he's dead.
excuse me?
Humeau , for instance. He's dead.
where did he go wrong?
him. . . .
he's special.
lt's more a matter of personal incompatibility.
but getting back to the cash. . . .
before you extract, you have to grease palms.
we grease the leaders' palms, they take the cash , and they do what they want with it.
the books are separate. But it's not against the law.
lt's even endorsed by customs.
no one talks about it, that's all. lt's taboo, but normal.
and Jacques Sibaud does the same?
the same procedure?
he is a spectator.
give him a desert, in six months the sand's gone.
when you do business, you move, you take risks.
Sibaud's hopeless.
madam, squealing on people at my age feels very strange.
l understand you , Mr. Boldi.
but if you can't stand prison. . . .
l saw that poor Humeau.
l feel sorry for him.
he's like a zombie.
he took it hard.
but let's not dramatize. He'll get over it.
my colleague is signing his release.
you made the right decision , Mr. Boldi.
go on. l'm listening.
search warrant! -You can't.
l can.
glad to see you!
what are you doing here?
give that back.
no way. lt goes under seals. -l bet.
that's illegal. -Think so?
this is entirely legitimate.
l only enter golf scores on my computer, to calculate my handicap.
how is it?
you have to sign.
no way. -Don't be childish. lt could cost you.
the key to the safe.
l said , the key! -l don't have it.
as you like.
what are they doing? -Their job.
behind the panel.
this is ridiculous. -l agree.
two black books. -You can't. They're confidential.
you're overstepping your prerogatives.
look, Mr. Sibaud. You're the one who came to me.
frankly, we're a long way from where we started.
we both knew that, right from the beginning.
that's why l won't allow this.
sorry. Did l scare you? -No, it's me. l'm silly.
a pan bagnat, from my region.
that's sweet of you.
l'm so tired.
we're here, Madam. We'll always be here for you.
that's sweet of you.
didn't l already say that?
you overslept? -Sorry, l broke down.
how did Sibaud take it? -ln his own way.
he'll use his golden parachute. -The poor thing.
how much?
that much?
Hello, Madam. -Hello, Benoit. Did you sleep well?
very well , thanks.
more hate mail , two letters today.
only two?
at times, l think l'm being followed.
lsn't it flattering? -You're out of control today!
that's good , because we've got work to do.
let me guess. Delombre's back in town?
you got it. With his lawyers, Wogner and Parlebas.
l like him. -Good.
we see them at 3: 00, with their tanned client.
they're usually tanned , aren't they?
how will you handle it?
very simply.
l let him do his spiel, then l read the charges, and l book him.
from sun to shade.
l was amazed when he swallowed his cell phone chip.
what a nutcase!
no, like all crooks, he's done his thinking.
he figures they'll be grateful. The rabble fears oblivion.
Martino! -Where?
your Honor, will you toast the outcome of this investigation with us?
temper your joy.
l'm glad the law is the same for all.
there are journalists upstairs.
celebrating an arrest is bad for our image.
see you tomorrow. -Tomorrow is Sunday.
l'll see you on Monday.
your friend will talk. So will the others.
they'll tell all and drag you down. l have to tell you.
l'm not part of their schemes.
the judge will say you didn't stop them.
what will you reply?
l have other options.
we've gone whole hog. -Oh , please!
your group is bled white. You can't say no.
l understand how you feel , but it's true.
you've hit bottom.
don't kid yourselves.
we're all in the same boat, and we've hit a storm.
but the wind is dropping, and the ship has held up rather well.
senator, l don't know if your optimism impresses or worries me.
lt's an objective analysis of the situation.
what do you think? -Things are settling down.
the group's getting devoured. -All because of that jerk Sibaud.
so let's think positive, as they say.
at least Sibaud's off our back. -At what price?
true, he did get a golden handshake.
as you say. -Good for him.
but otherwise, the system held up well.
and l'm sure our friends in trouble can withstand the pressure.
Boldi, for instance. -Oh , him!
that's another story. We'll deal with Boldi later.
the group may have been gobbled up, but our structure is intact.
for now!
don't be so negative.
your father's bank changed names, didn't it?
you got swallowed up, too. Did it change anything?
you got reorganized. We'll reorganize, too!
what about that woman , that diabolical judge?
will she keep making trouble for us?
l understand she's getting a promotion.
again. The last one was a disaster.
l admit it was something of a shambles, and we got taken.
we were wrong to give her that associate.
this brandy is excellent.
your file says, " He sent his boy for caviar. "
l'm not going down over caviar!
the lifestyle doesn't go with the official salaries.
what do l plead?
tax exemption, reinvestment...
lt's pragmatic.
lt's legal.
what isn't legal?
who cares what they do!
let them keep fighting it out. They're animals.
elephants dance together, you dance alone.
merge while there's still time.
not credible. Too small.
l'm warning you, there's a facelift in the offing.
sounds like the BBC during the war. " London calling. "
what does he mean by a facelift?
that they're on the alert. They're selling off.
and to avoid an audit, they buy off sleazy politicians.
so what do we do? Everyone's controlled.
lt's the rule. -What is?
lnvoke state security to let your pals get rich?
l'm not saying it's moral, but it's the rule.
the Presiding Judge wants to see you.
Damn!
time flies with you.
yes? -Madam Charmant-Killman.
send her in.
you don't look so good. -l'm okay. Just a little tired.
how are you coming along?
l contacted my Swiss counterpart. He explained the system.
the funds go through various money markets, then they end up in London.
you're moving fast!
l have to.
l'm counting on you to contact the Chancellor.
look, calm down and listen to me. You look really beat.
you should take a vacation. -Not until the Swiss banks answer.
the situation's changed.
the new group intends to start on a new footing.
l don't believe a word of it.
lt will be the same, the same schemes and new expenses.
you lost your objectivity.
l need a fresh eye.
what do you mean exactly?
l'll be honest with you. l don't want you to run into trouble.
so listen to me.
there are too many vipers involved. Let it rest for a while.
lf you won't take time off, l can have you transferred.
a real promotion , something good.
don't they call my post the most powerful in France?
they say lots of things.
think it over, my dear Jeanne.
you know l'm very fond of you. l'll take care of your bonus.
you can keep it, Your Honor. To buy yourself a pair of balls.
what did he want?
he thanked me. -lt's the least he could do.
l mean , he said to take a vacation. He's cutting me loose.
got a cigarette?
he said it like that?
he was a little uneasy. l sent him packing.
what are you going to do?
he said he needed a fresh eye.
l may be paranoid, but l feel like the victim of a conspiracy.
so, what are you going to do?
would you take over for me?
lf you asked me to.
lf l didn't? -l'd refuse, of course.
then l'm asking you to.
l'm not sure they'll want me.
they have to watch out. The case has made too much noise.
so, again, what are you going to do?
l'm going home.
what's the matter? -l tried to call you.
l turned off my cell. What is it?
bad news.
your husband jumped out the window.
he's dead? -No, hospitalized.
l came for you.
the cops called.
they couldn't reach you.
they located your nephew.
then l told them l'd find you and bring you over.
did they say how he is?
vaguely.
but he's alive.
alive?
Yes.
you were right.
Martino hinted l'd probably take over the case.
for the moment, anyway.
you okay? -How is he?
out of it.
they say his condition is serious, but not critical.
can we see him? -Right now there is no point.
but he might wake up any minute.
Erika, this is Felix.
Philippe's nephew.
l work with Erika.
those two hoods are cops.
they want to question you , but you scare them.
let's go see them.
gentlemen. -Madam.
sorry, but we need to know. . . .
do you know of a gun in your apartment?
a gun?
no. Where?
ln a shoebox, wrapped in tissue paper.
l knew nothing about it. What's the link?
we wondered why he jumped out the window when he had a gun handy.
maybe he was reluctant to die.
what l liked right off was his smile.
amid all those hypocrites, he had that smile.
he said l lacked something. That he'd tell me. . . .
some day.
what do l lack?
ask him.
you think he'll pull through?
l think so. l'm not ready to grieve him.
madam Charmant, things look better. His condition is stable.
can l see him? -He's asleep.
just a peek?
come with me.
l can't let you go in. -l just want a peek.
l'm sorry.
madam.
Mr. Chairman.
l heard about your husband. l'm sorry.
what are you here for? Are you ill?
l went into a depression after l was released.
Really?
l'm sorry. -Don't be.
you weren't the cruelest in this affair.
l hope it all works out, Madam.
so do l , Mr. Chairman.
good-bye.
excuse me, l must return to my flock.
funny doctor.
people used to say that priests were soul doctors. He's a body priest.
or a soul cop! -What?
we used to say priests were soul cops.
only God can judge.
the real question is, what is God?
another time. l'm going to bed.
you should , too.
go on. l want to stay.
you should go rest.
erika's right.
lf you stay, Philippe will sleep, but you won't.
you always know how to convince me.
my dear aunt, l'm a great Cartesian.
l feel like l'm in a dream.
you want a ride? -lt's too far.
l'll take care of you.
you have a car?
l'm off.
sleep well. You have work tomorrow.
hope to see you soon , Erika. -See you.
l forgot to tell you.
your trusty clerk Benoit is a real bastard.
he's the mole.
l caught him calling a guy named Le Blanc.
you know him? -Yes, vaguely.
l'll explain tomorrow.
good night.
good night.
she has a nice ass, but l bet she's a bit loony.
what makes you say that? -Her profession.
why not say l'm loony, too? -l almost did.
there's no job without risk.
what's that?
not bad.
three jacks against two pairs, aces high.
they didn't do you any favors.
what are you going to do?
three jacks!
what a world!
you plan on continuing?
l don't know.
you did your job.
you cleaned up good.
you're naive, nephew.
there's still a lot of dirt left and right.
believe me.
so. . . .
will you keep going?
to hell with them.
madam, your ticket and your passport.
Marji, stop running!
look! It's Nioucha over there!
Marji, you've really grown up!
did you bring me a present?
how is Paris?
and the Eiffel Tower?
welcome to Teheran.
you're here!
your luggage.
no, it's me!
come on! They're waiting for us.
I remember.
back then, I had a quiet life.
a little girl's life.
I used to love fries with ketchup and Bruce Lee,
I was wearing Adidas shoes and I had 2 obsessions:
to shave my legs and to become the last prophetess.
if you put a pen under your tits and it gets stuck then you're in deep shit.
if we shake this one, we can fill a bo.
they let me see him last week.
he wasn't a pretty sight.
they told me that they would release him. It's been 4 years.
don't worry.
this regime won't last much longer. There's going to be one heck of a row.
mom! Marji hurt me!
the dragon's revenge is a dish best eaten cold!
the dragon is gonna get some.
I, Marjane, future prophetess, have decided that:
one, everybody must have a good behavior.
two, everybody must preach good words.
three, everybody must do one good deed.
four, the poor must be able to eat one fried chicken everyday.
five, no old woman will suffer ever again.
Marji, if it's gonna be like that,
I'll be your first disciple.
Really? Great!
how to be sure that they won't suffer anymore?
it'll be forbidden.
I should have thought about it.
what's going on?
death to the ! death to the shah!
I knew it!
this is an historic moment!
he's finally gonna pay.
Yes, daughter. Your father will be avenged.
the shah will meet his buddies in Washington.
as for myself, I think I love the shah.
he's been chosen by God.
Yes! Absolutely!
God himself told me. The teacher too.
the shah wasn't chosen by God.
lies!
Shh...
that's what they say.
I'll tell you how it happened.
truth is that 50 years ago, the shah's father, an officer, wanted to overthrow the Qadjar emperor.
I'll do like Ataturk! I'll modernize the country.
I'll create a republic!
but the English heard about it.
Hello! Why do you want to create a republic?
you could be emperor!
me? Emperor?
of course! It's better than president.
you'll have full powers.
a country like yours needs a strong man like you to rule it.
Hmm... It's quite true.
and also... you know that the clergy is against the republic.
between us, he's right.
what must I do?
nothing. You give us the oil.
we'll take care of the rest.
now, I am the king! Everything that belong to you is mine.
he was an asshole!
Oh! Yes and no.
he was a dictator, but he modernized Iran.
he loved his country, unlike his son, his successor.
I am the king now! I am the light of the Aryans!
I'll make this country the most modern of all time!
our people will shine again!
Yes, the shah's father has been very hard.
he put your grandpa in prison.
but his son was ten times worse.
grandpa has been in prison?
Yes! He was a member of the royal family.
he was a Qadjar prince. The shah's father took everything from him.
he went to prison because he was a communist.
my grandpa was a Qadjar prince and also a communist!
God damn it! You're still alive. I was worried.
they shot on people! It was hot.
we escaped but we got caught later.
those sons of bitches took my films.
we were at the police station. Marji was over excited.
she was a pain in the neck with the proletarians, the class struggle and this bearded man, Che Guevara.
the guy who was killed wasn't even 20 years old.
what is this country?
it's one hell of a mess, daughter. Death to the shah!
here it goes again!
death to the shah! Death to the shah!
go to bed now!
death to the shah! Death to the shah!
I understand your revolt.
we'll try to walk together towards democracy.
we'll build the future together.
Siamak!
they released you? Hello, Ebi.
it's Siamak! He's back.
Hello, Tadji.
we're so happy to see you alive!
come in!
don't stay in front of the door.
but it's Marjane! You've grown!
you were still a baby when I was arrested.
and now you're a young lady.
who is this guy?
my father. He was in prison.
he's a hero.
those scientists knew the human body very well.
they knew how to hit where it hurts.
I've been lashed with large electric wire cables.
my foot doesn't look like a foot anymore.
there are nerves going straight to the brain under the feet.
it's an indescribable pain.
our torturers had been trained by the CIA.
they were at the forefront of torture.
what about Hamid? What happened to him?
hamid has been murdered.
as a member of the guerilla, it was hell for him.
he has some cyanide with him.
but unfortunately, he couldn't use it.
so he endured the worst tortures.
the one who loses will be tortured to the death.
cool! What kind of torture?
he will be lashed with the electric wire cable!
but first, he'll have to put that in his mouth.
and chew three times.
Yeah!
look, it's Ramine!
farzad told me that his father was a member of the shah's secret service.
his father killed a million of people with his own hands!
a million!?
Absolutely.
we'll give Ramine a lesson in their name.
Yeah! We'll gouge his eyes out!
Marjane!
what are you doing?
Marji found some nails. We're gonna smash Ramine's face.
would you like it if I nailed you by the ears?
go back home into your room and stay there.
Marjane, what's happening to you?
it's not a behavior worthy of a prophetess.
but God, Ramine's father killed people!
Marjane, this poor Ramine must not bear the burden of his father's mistakes.
bad guys will pay sooner or later. Have faith in my justice.
your duty is to forgive, not to make justice.
Ramine
what do you want?
listen, your father is a murderer, but it's not your fault.
I forgive you.
he killed communists, and communists are the devil!
the country was euphoric during the months following the shah's departure.
everybody had been a revolutionary and had fought the shah.
the wine stain of our neighbour had changed into a war wound.
our teacher, admirer of the shah, ordered us to tear off all the pictures of the royal family.
political meetings were increasing and yesterday's enemies had become heroes of the nation.
it's in this climate that, one night, uncle Anouche appeared in my life.
now, everything will be better. Nothing will stop the people.
we'll finally have a free and fair society.
proletariat will rule as Lenin predicted.
uncle Anouche?
how long did you stay in prison?
nine years.
longer than Laly's father?
how old are you? Are you a communist?
Marji, let your uncle digest!
she wants to know everything.
it's a good thing to be curious.
have you digested?
go to bed!
but!
put your pajamas on and I'll come.
did you see? They're preparing the elections.
people will want to keep their freedom after this dictatorship.
it will never be worse than under the shah.
I'm ready!
you'll see, she'll eat your brain.
I'm ready!!
I'll start with the beginning.
I was 18 years old when my uncle and my friends declared the independence of Azerbaidjan's Iranian province.
Wow!
Fereydoun appointed himself as minister of Justice of this republic.
justice is the basis of democracy.
men must be equal in front of the law.
I became his secretary.
it's just a beginning. We'll free Iran from dictatorship. Province by province, city by city.
I'm sure of it!
it wasn't easy for me because my father was loyal to the shah.
my son is a traitor! Go and meet your stupid brother!
you'll all be shot! Shot!
my father couldn't have been more right. One morning...
my God! Fereydoun!
I had to escape. I had no choice.
while my uncle was facing his destiny alone...
I walked for days in the storm.
I was hungry, I was cold, but I kept going.
I crossed Alborz mountains to take refuge at my parents home, in Astara.
who dares bother me at this hour?
my God, Anouche! My God!
it's our son, he's almost dead.
my dear son!
my son...
my dear son, forgive me!
I couldn't stay, I was wanted.
I had to go into else.
I swam across the Aras river and I arrived in USSR.
what did you do then?
I went to Leningrad.
then to Moscow, I got my doctorate in Marism-Leninism.
but I was missing my family.
I tried to came back by train with forged identity papers but it didn't work.
they arrested me. Then you went to prison?
Yes. You know...
it's important that you know.
the memory of the family must not be forgotten.
even if it's hard, even if you don't understand everything.
don't worry, uncle Anouche. I'll never forget.
were you married in Russia?
it's late. You must sleep.
here, it's for you.
I made it in prison.
it's made of breadcrumbs.
99, 99% of the people voted democratically for the islamic republic.
it's normal. Each revolution has its transition period.
half the country is illiterate.
only nationalism or religious ethics rally people.
mina left the country. She thinks it's too dangerous.
we found Mohsen drowned in the bath tube.
don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Siamak and his family left. Those bastards killed his sister.
maybe we should leave too.
you could be a cleaning lady and me, a taxi driver.
we'll get rid of the anti-revolutionaries.
between them and us, there's only one law, the law of blood.
Marji? Yes?
they arrested Anouche.
I know.
daddy! It will be all right, honey.
do you want to do something for him?
Anouche can have one visitor. You're the one he wants to see.
I'll go.
ten minutes.
what a nice dress!
what a nice little girl!
your visit honours me.
you're the little girl I wish I would have had.
but you'll see, one day, proletariat will rule
here.
I made another cygnus with breadcrumbs for you.
it's the uncle of the first one.
star of my life.
what's up my child? Don't be sad.
shut the fuck up! They killed him and you did nothing!
I've nothing to do with it...
shut up! I don't want to see you again!
go away! Go away!
get lost!!!
one year after the revolution, Iraq attacked Iran.
saddam took advantage of the country's weakness to strike.
the revolution and the army massive cleanings had weakened us.
in the name of the fight against the foreign enemy, the state wiped out the enemy inland, the old opponents to the shah's government.
arrests and executions increased.
everybody was scared.
the new government established even more repressive laws.
within two years, our everyday life changed.
and so did we.
come on!
on the heart for our martyrs!
sons and daughters of Iran, war killed our best children.
truth will soon arise from their blood.
who did they die for?
it's for us.
it's for us!
Hey! Martyrs!
martyrs! Martyrs!
finish me off!
Satrapi, what are you doing?
I'm suffering, isn't it obvious?
go to the class immediately!
the veil is synonymous with freedom. A worthy woman must cover herself from the eyes of men. The one revealing herself is a sinner.
she'll burn in hell. Hey! Did you see that?
Wow! Our soldiers are dying for our country... Hey!
look!
pfff! Abba, it's for the simple minded!
go outside in close order! Come on!
mom, what do we eat?
what about some chili?
Yes, so we can fart!
give me that!
I saw it first! Yeah right, bitch!
stop!
that's how it is as soon as a shop is empty!
each must take according to their needs.
what business is it of yours?
shut up!
put your scarf back on.
Hey! I'm talking to you!
don't get too familiar.
show some respect.
respect?
women like you,
I fuck them against the walls!
get in!
mom, are you all right?
Yes, darling. I'm fine.
are you moving or what?
shut the hell up!
mom, give me 50 tomans!
what for?
to buy a tape.
what about your Bee Gees tapes?
mama The Bee Gees suck!
Stevie Wonder.
Julio Iglesias. Pink Floyd.
Jichael Mackson. Lipstick, nail polish, cards.
iron Maiden.
how much? 100.
what the hell is this outfit?
punk shoes!
which ones?
those.
they're sneakers.
it's punk.
I play basketball at school.
and this jacket?
and that?
michael Jackson!
a symbol of decadence!
not at all, madam. It's... It's...
Malcolm X. Are you kidding me?
it's Michael Jackson!
lower your scarf, you little whore!
follow us to the committee. Sorry, madam.
my mother is dead. My evil mother-in-law is taking care of me.
she'll kill if I don't go back home. She'll burn me with the iron.
she'll force my father to put me in an orphanage.
have mercy! Please, madam. Mercy...
mercy. Have mercy, madam...
our soldiers bravery bore fruit.
tonight, our army destroyed 63 tanks and 26 Iraqi fighters.
the blood of our martyrs is irrigating our sacred land.
deserts of despair will blossom from it.
dying as a martyr is like injecting blood in the veins of society.
are you all right, Mrs Nassrine?
no, I'm not. They gave that to my son at school.
they told them that if they died in combat they would go to heaven with this key!
they've been told that in heaven, there's plenty of food and women...
women?!
well, yes...He's 14 years old, he's interested.
I suffered a lot.
I raised my 5 children with my tears.
now they want to take my elder son for this key.
I've always been faithful to religion.
I prayed, wore a veil and obeyed.
if that's how things are then I don't want to believe in anything.
it's me!
they arrested the Rochanis.
they found some alcohol at their home.
who are you covering yourself for?
for mister.
that's how we've been raised.
don't worry.
I'll talk to your son.
thanks to my parents,
Mrs Nassrine's son didn't go up to the front.
between the fear of the bombings, the government repressing, and the spying of the neighbours, life was taking its course.
to make things bearable, people were partying in secret.
people were getting drunk at the parties. Alcohol was forbidden, so my uncle was providing the family with wine.
he has installed a wine production laboratory in his cellar.
Mrs Nassrine, my uncle's cleaning lady was pressing the grapes.
may God forgive me!
going to these parties was dangerous but it was our only little moment of freedom.
come on! Get out!
identity papers, driver licence.
OK, ok.
come closer.
blow. You drank.
you're lying, you dirty westerner!
that's enough!
how dare you talk to me like that?
shut up!
listen.
I could be your mother.
how old are you? My daughter is 13.
you'd be in hell without your wife.
thank you!
get in! We're going to your place to check if there are some bottles.
grandma, Marji, you go first.
empty all the bottles.
but how? Don't worry, my daughter.
I was used to it with your father.
we had to hide the flyers.
listen, the neighbour on the same floor is a bit old.
he has a heart condition. He could die if we make too much noise. Can we come to an agreement?
Hey! Where are you going?
I'm diabetic, son. I have to drink some syrup.
diabetic? Like my mother.
go ahead.
where are the others?
their arrogance isn't ideological. A few bills were enough.
tell me, did you throw everything away?
well, yes!
shit!
it's his heart again.
they wanted to stop the communists.
they threw a grenade. Taher couldn't endure it.
he was lying on the ground when I arrived.
everything will be all right.
no, it won't.
he must have an open-heart operation.
they can't afford it here.
he must be sent to England.
I went to see the administrative director of the hospital.
it's unbelievable. Do you know who he was?
my old window cleaner.
I pretended not to recognize this moron.
only people who are seriously ill can leave the country.
my husband had three heart attacks.
he must be operated or he'll die.
we'll do our best.
if God wants it, he'll get better.
everything depends on God.
I need your authorization for his passport.
if God wants it.
this asshole grew a beard and wears a suit.
and now he's a director!
my husband's fate depends on a window cleaner!
he doesn't watch women in the eyes anymore.
fucking asshole!
I know someone who is making passports.
calm down. It'll be all right.
wait! I'm coming with you.
where did I put it?
ha! Here it is!
look at that.
it looks like a real one.
a month work, just for this stamp!
what's your name?
how much time do you need?
passports are very much in demand.
I make a living with that. They closed my publishing business.
it takes 15 days, but I'll do it in a week.
great. Be quick.
it's Niloufar.
this is Ebi,
Anouche's brother, I talked to you about him.
hello.
she is a communist too.
her brother was my messenger. I'm hiding her in my cellar.
it's the only place where she's safe.
is he stupid or what?
he's gonna get crushed!
here! That's what I said!
don't look.
it's too ugly. Stop!
what of piece of shit! Apart from cutting their stomach open and making disgusting monsters, those Japanese can't do anything.
grandma, do you think that uncle Taher is gonna die?
of course. Really? You think so?
if he doesn't find any passport to leave, he won't make it.
he shouldn't have smoked so much.
what a load of crap! His heart is sick because his children are far away.
a hot beans pastry boat please.
children always leave sooner or later.
but being separated from your 13 years old children because of war is absurd!
it can break you heart for sure.
I'd be dead already if I was him.
may God eterminate those barbarians.
may God hear you.
Hello? Ha, Khosrow, is that you?
so, what's up?
they arrested Niloufar. I have to escape!
Hello?
Khosrow?
Hello?
niloufar was executed.
Khosrow escape by the mountains in Turkey and went to Sweden.
uncle Taher was buried three weeks after these events.
the war intensified.
let me pass!
sorry!
let me pass!
stop!
I live over there!
go.
Marji! Mom!
are you all right?
Yes, honey. I'm fine.
where did the missile go?
it hit the Baba Levy's.
what? The Baba Levy's?
thanks to the government, we don't have any political prisoner left.
madam? We finally earned our freedom.
madam? What?
it's the new government that ordered the execution of my uncle.
from 3000 prisoners during the shah, we now have 300000 with you.
how dare you lie?
stop it!
who was it?
the school. Marji put the religion teacher to her place.
again? Yes.
she takes after her uncle.
do you want her to end like her uncle, executed?
do you know what they do to young women like Niloufar?
the law forbids to kill a virgin.
she's forced to marry a Guardian of the Revolution.
then he takes her virginity and executes her.
do you understand?
if someone touches one of her hair, I'll kill him!
a little later, they decided to send me abroad.
since I had studied at the French school in Teheran,
I'd go to the French school in Vienna.
my father managed to get me a visa.
my mother's best friend was supposed to take me in.
the day before my departure, grandma came to sleep at home.
every morning she put jasmine flowers in her bra.
when she was taking it off, the flowers were falling from her tits.
it was magic.
how do you manage to have such round tits at your age?
everyday I put them for 10 minutes in an icy water bowl.
I'll miss you.
I'll come and see you.
listen.
I'm gonna give you an advice that will always be useful.
in your life, you'll meet a lot of assholes.
remember that it's stupidity that pushes them to be evil.
it will prevent you from answering to their nastiness.
because there's nothing worse than bitterness and vengeance.
always remain worthy and true to yourself.
you'll see, everything will be all right.
no tears. Think about your future.
europe is opening to you.
when you'll arrive in Vienna, eat a sachertorte.
it's a delicious chocolate cake. We'll come to see you.
you're a grown up. No tears!
daddy... Enough.
you must leave.
never forget who you are and where you're coming from.
my daughter.
mom! My little Marji.
europe opened itself to me, but not like I imagined.
after a few days at my mother's friend home, she decided that their apartment was too small to accommodate me.
she found me a bed and board where I would be very well according to her.
huh?
I was finding shelves of products that no longer existed in my country.
for a while, going to the supermarket was my favorite pastime...
favorite pastime...
anyway! It was urgent that I make some new friends.
at the French school, I could understand the others and be understood.
do you have a smoke?
quickly, the school dropouts were interested in me.
there was Momo, Thierry, Olivier and Eve.
my nationality and my history were fascinating them.
you saw a revolution and a war?
Yeah. Did you see many dead people?
err... A few.
Wow!
terrific.
I was soon a member of the band.
with Momo, I discovered nonchalance, a forced nihilism concept and the alternative Vienna life.
I admit that at the beginning it was a little difficult.
and after all, why not?
I was trying to convince myself that I had found my place.
but I remained different.
holidays were sure to remind me of it.
shit, Christmas again! I'll have to see my whole family.
all this because of an American invention.
Santa Claus is in red and white...
it was a Coca-Cola mascot.
I'll be bored to death in Monte-Carlo.
monte-carlo is still all right.
me, I'm gonna see my father in Brazil, what a load of crap!
it's at least a 13 hours flight!
holidays are scraps left to the pleb.
if the anarchists had won, we wouldn't work anymore.
is everything all right, my dear?
it's fine. What are you doing for Christmas?
so?
she'll be with some friends from school. Be careful.
is there anything you need?
you're right, enjoy it. Kisses.
eat some fruits and vegetables.
is it a common behavior?
what?
the way you're eating? We can eat in front of TV.
maybe, but not in a saucepan.
so it's true, Iranians have no education.
is it true that you were all prostitutes?
Oh!
it was the beginning of a series of moves.
I was flying from apartment to apartment.
Eve and her mother took me in.
after that I was living with 8 homosexuals.
next, I was living in a maid room then at some friends home, and at some friends of some friends home, to finally end in Frau Doktor Schloss villa.
she was a retired philosophy teacher.
to sum up, she was nuts.
the rent is 2000 schillings a month.
you like dogs, don't you? Yes, yes. I love them.
Yuki adopted you.
dogs have a sixth sense.
they recognize good people.
I decided to become integrated during the next year.
but sometimes, western culture remained a mistery.
ja voll! Ja voll!
I had to improve my knowledge.
from Sartre to Bakounin, from Zweig to Freud...
I read everything I could.
but I understood that some things would be beyond me forever.
did you see? This fat pig Waldheim has been elected.
I want to puke!
it can't last any longer. We must demonstrate!
all of this is hot air.
life is empty.
when man realizes it, he creates games for ruler and...
bullshit! Life isn't absurd!
people give their life for freedom!
my uncle didn't die for fun.
fucking asshole!
my feeling of disarray was immense.
I was safe here while my kins were enduring the war.
I couldn't let go this feeling of guilt.
I wanted to live like a girl of my age.
the time of change was coming.
within a few months, I became a young woman.
it was a time of endlessly repeating ugliness.
first, I grew 18 cm. Then my face changed.
my face got longer, my right eye got bigger, followed by my chin.
my right hand became huge, then it was my left foot.
my nose got three time bigger. My breast grew.
my buttocks appeared, restoring my centre of gravity.
and to finish, a huge mole appeared on my nose.
you see, Yuki? I told you. She's a whore!
what a shitty music!
there are only assholes here.
Bakounin wanted the socialist resolutions to be voted.
we wouldn't be where we are.
Really?
capitalism is eating away our society, don't you see?
Yeah, of course. Well... Where are you from... Marie-Jeanne?
yeah... I'm from...I'm French.
ha? I wouldn't have guessed. Last year I was in Paris.
excuse me, I must go.
okay. Well then, bye.
so you're French?
grandma, stop it.
it was just a question.
I didn't know you were French.
do you think it's easy to be Iranian?
people are looking at me as if I was a savage.
we're just fanatics screaming and fighting each other.
is it a reason to disown your origin?
remember what I told you.
be true to yourself.
do you know what she told my brother?
that she was French.
I'm not kidding. Did he believe her?
what? Did you see her face?
he wanted to chat her up? Don't be ridiculous!
I'd kill myself if he went out with this ugly ducking.
shut the fuck up!
I'm Iranian and proud to be!
after 3 years in Austria I was finally feeling good.
Momo, Thierry, Eve and Olivier had left school.
I had new friends.
there was Birgit, a 30 years old hippy with the face of an old child.
she had a house in the forest where she was having parties.
the State could rest easy. Those so-called anarchist meetings were just a pretext to drink beer and eat sausages.
I met Fernando at one of these parties.
when I saw him, I immediately knew that he was the man of my life.
Marjane, are you here?
that night, I finally understood, thanks to you.
you revealed me to myself.
if it doesn't work with you, it won't work with any girl.
I know it, now. I am homoseual.
ha! It's good to tell it.
thank you, Marjane. Thank you.
you're welcome.
I swore that I wouldn't let myself be caught at it again.
I won't let myself be caught at it again!
love is a conventional feeling!
but "Life is life," as the other losers sang it.
one morning in November, Markus came into my life.
shall I walk you back?
I had finally found love.
nothing was frightening me. The future looked radiant.
markus was to become a great writer.
he was reading me extracts from his piece in his room.
we were as one.
I bought some croissants!
wait. It's not what you think.
Marjane, I love you!
I love you!
I can't find my brooch.
it's you who stole it!
leave me alone.
I shan't let it rest at that!
fucking thief!
go to hell! I hate you!
you and your fucking dog!!!
don't talk like that about my dog. Where are you going?
you won't get on with it so easily. Fuck off!!!
fucking thief! Give me my brooch back!
I'll call the police! Come back!
how could I be so stupid? This bastard got round me.
I'm a stupid cunt, cunt, cunt!
how could I fall in love with this scumbag, this skinflint?
shall I take you back?
I must fill it up. Do we split 50-50?
this asshole's mouth smelled like shit with his damned nature!
fuck! What a stupid cunt are you?
my eye hurts like hell!
show me, my love. No!
asshole! Writer, my ass!
with his shitty piece! It sucked!
this son of a bitch had no balls.
he didn't take my defense in front of his mother.
ja, Mutter.
a gutless individual, yes!
and it was always me who was buying the junk!
this jerk was waiting for me in the car.
he wouldn't have been bothered if I had been arrested.
what a stupid cunt I was! A stupid cunt!
it was my first night in the street. The first of many.
I had lost some of my relatives in a revolution.
I had survived a war.
and it's a love story that almost got me.
how goes it?
you're waking up?
well, that was a close one!
it's a good thing we found you. You've had several bronchitis.
I strictly forbid you to smoke any cigarette.
last name? Satrapi.
first name? Marjane.
where do you live? In Iran.
in Iran?
can I make a phone call?
Hello?
daddy? Marjane! Is that you?
we were worried to death for the last 2 months!
daddy... Can I come back?
of course. You won't ask me any question?
no, I promise you.
I'm putting you through to your mother.
Marjane? Mom, please, don't cry.
come back home. We're waiting for you.
mom... We won't ask you any question.
it's a promise.
don't you have anything forbidden?
pork, alcohol, cards, music, film, fashion, porno?
no, sir.
arrange your veil.
Yes, sir.
you can go.
it's Marji!
my daughter... I didn't recognize you.
you're here. You've grown.
you're here.
I saw the Alborz mountains again. It had been snowing.
my father was wondering if he had to put the snow chains on his car.
we took the breakfast together, as before.
my mother had prepared my favorite omelette.
nothing had changed, and yet, I knew that...
nothing would be like before.
we talked about many things.
my parents kept their word and didn't ask me any question.
I didn't feel very comfortable but I thought that the nightmare was behind us.
the future might get brighter once the war will be over.
the war is over for sure.
but people forgot why there's been 8 years of war.
let her breath.
she's coming!
no, no, mom. It's all right.
the West sold weapons to both sides.
we had been stupid enough to enter this cynical game.
8 years of war for nothing.
a million dead for nothing.
the last days had been horrifying.
a month before the armistice, Iraq bombed Teheran on a daily basis.
as if it had to be wiped out from the map.
just before the cease fire, the government got scared because some opponents had fled to Iran.
the government was afraid of the threat that represented the thousands of political prisoners.
so the state decided to put an end to it the hard way.
they proposed to the convicts to renounce their ideals, to promise to be loyal to the regime and to serve their sentence or to be executed.
most of them were executed.
that's it.
now streets are named after martyrs.
that's all that's left to famillies. Street names.
when you walk in Teheran, it's like being in a cemetery.
you've really grown!
you'll soon be able to catch the balls of the Lord.
grandma!
tell me.
how was Vienna?
well, yeah... It was different.
do you remember Mina?
of course, she's my cousin.
she got married. She has two kids.
she's still as stupid as before.
and Shila, do you remember her?
Yes. She's ugly.
she has hair on her face. She looks like a gorilla.
and do you remember Mojdeh?
I remember everybody.
she got a divorce. He had a small dick.
well, that's what Shahri said.
she told Mehri who told me.
you'll see them all soon.
Oh no!
well, yes...
you must be speaking German now.
Yes, a little.
I know how to say" Ich liebe dich" .
Vienna reminds me of Empress Sissi.
you saw Romy Schneider?
Marjane... Stars are shining in the sky and you in my heart.
what a nun face! It's doesn't look like you lived in Europe.
Really?
talk a little! Tell us.
I don't know...
how are the night clubs in Vienna?
well... I didn't go out much.
I don't like night clubs too much. What?!
did you have sex?
well, yes.
is it good?
it depends.
what? You had sex with several men?
join a nursery school. Have your nose fixed.
I can't bear it anymore! It's 40℃!
I can't stand it any longer.
damn hairdresser!
you're not worthy of my son! Oh! Anahita!
Hello!
Marjane just went out.
all right, I'll tell her.
good bye.
stop watching TV! Didn't you want to try the exam?
you're ruining the best years of your life.
go and meet people!
everybody is pissing me off.
out of 7 million inhabitants, isn't there one person who you don't think is stupid?
there was Kia, my childhood friend, I wanted to see him.
when I saw him, I understood my grandma's words.
he was almost dead.
kia went to war.
he lost an arm and a leg. I spent a good time with him.
we even laughed. After that, I relativized my miseries.
Yes. For him, it's his whole life that's screwed up.
yet, he laughed about it.
it's the only way to bear the unbearable.
whatever I repeat myself, I can't do it.
it's still unbearable.
what I endured lies too heavy on me, but who can I talk to about it?
you see? Hmm.
my relatives have suffered so much.
I was a stranger in Austria and I became one here.
I see. Your sickness has a name.
it's a nervous breakdown.
there are some effective treatments.
I'll prescribe some medication.
don't you want to come with us?
some fresh air will do you some good.
no. I want to be alone.
don't worry.
so, kiddo, what are you doing here?
well... I'm dead.
my child, your time hasn't come yet.
Oh really?
my daughter, you'll have to put yourself out.
he's right for once!
you've got much to do. Rise and shine.
go and do what you have to do.
don't forget that the fight goes on!
Yeah, yeah. The fight goes on.
rising up Back on the street
did my time Took my chances
went the distance Now I'm back on my feet
just a man and his will to survive
it's the eye of the tiger It's the cream of the fight
rising up to the challenge of our rival
and the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night
and he's watching us all in the eye
of the tiger
I'm so hungry!
didn't you eat yet? She's on a diet.
are you nuts? Her cousin asked her to bring back an issue of Vogue.
she's reading it all the time!
it looks like you've made a hit with him.
enough! I'm ashamed.
we'll talk about Botticelli.
Venus Birth in particular.
we could also...
call it The Spring, like the other great...
...Botticelli's mythology shown at the Offices.
Hey! You, there!
why are you laughing?
do you wanna bet that I'll take off my veil?
yeah right! How much do we bet?
400 tomans?
go!
at the beginning of the 90s, the time of great ideals was over.
after the Revolution, the government had put so many students in prison that we didn't dare to talk about politics anymore.
and the war was finally behind us.
we were looking for happiness so much that we forgot that we weren't free.
grandma, are you here?
Yes, I was here to see you.
how nice, you're all dressed up to the nines!
are you in love?
exactly, I had a date with him.
I got a real fright. Guardians of the Revolution charged.
do you see how I'm made-up?
I was stuck. Then I remembered this guy who was eyeballing me.
you know them.
I couldn't pretend to be a little defenseless girl.
brother!
yes Sister?
a man said indecent things to me.
where is he so we can shut him up?
over there.
that's him!
aren't you ashamed? Don't you have a mother? A sister?
would you like it if we insulted them?
Ouch!
I didn't do anything! I swear it on my mother!
what did they do with the guy?
they picked him up.
do you think that's funny?
Yes, don't you?
I think that you're a fucking slut! That's what I think.
I had no other choice!
Yes, you had!
everybody has a choice.
everybody always has a choice!
your grandfather went to prison for protecting innocents.
and your uncle Anouche!
did you forget why he died?
what did I teach you?
Intergrity!
does this word ring a bell, miss?
shame on you!
the lady with the bag!
stop running! The lady with the bag!
stop running! Hey! Stop running!
madam, why are you running?
I'm late. 5 minutes late.
you must not run like that.
when you're running, your behind makes indecent moves.
then don't look at my ass!!!
fuck it! Wherever we stand, we always see the same thing!
anatomy lesson my ass! The only thing sticking out is her big nose.
go to the central university immediately.
all the absentees will be suspended for 2 weeks.
we must behave correctly.
the flowers of the Revolution grew from the blood of our martyrs.
to have an indecent behavior is like trampling on the blood of the martyrs.
so, I'm asking to all young ladies to wear tighter trousers and longer cowls.
they must cover their hair and must not use any make-up.
does anybody have a question?
if not, the session is ended. Yes?
our cowls are short, our trousers are indecent, we put on a lot of make-up, etc.
I spend a lot of time at the workshop.
I need to be able to move freely to draw.
a longer cowl makes it difficult.
our trousers efficiently hide our shapes.
knowing that those trousers are in fashion, is the religion defending our integrity...
or is it simply opposed to fashion?
you make comments about us while the brothers...
have many different clothes and hair cuts.
sometimes, we can even see their underwears.
why is it that as a woman,
I'm not allowed to feel anything when watching them, while men can get excited on our shorter cowls?
it's great. It's as if you had cut their little dick.
take off this fucking cowl. It makes me claustrophobic.
I tend to forget it.
don't ever forget it.
it's fear that makes us lose our self-awareness.
it's also changing us into cowards.
you had guts.
I'm proud of you.
I want to leave. To go where?
to the USA or to Europe.
where in Europe?
I can't stand living here any longer.
what about us? You'll come with me.
I don't want to leave. That's because you're still nostalgic.
sooner or later, people will disgust you.
you can die in the West, nobody cares.
don't worry.
we'll manage.
what's your relationship with him?
good.
we'll call your parents.
either they pay or it will be some lashing.
when your mother and I were 15, we used to walk together holding hands.
and yet it was in this country.
you know, that's how the situation is now.
you have to be careful.
I think it's better if you're not seen outside anymore.
this situation is unbearable. We can't go anywhere.
we're like prisoners. It's not a life!
yeah... We can only get married.
so?
did you cry, mom? No.
I always wanted you to be independent, educated and cultured.
and now you're getting married at 21 years old!
I want you to leave Iran to be free and liberated!
it's fine.
trust me. I know what I'm doing.
did you see the car keys? Huh?
I left them here.
I don't know.
they were here.
we don't share anything anymore.
you're the ideal couple to us.
ideal couple, my ass!
what? You want my picture?
asshole!
not so long ago, you were saying that you loved him.
it's impossible to know...until we live under the same roof.
what will you do? Are you gonna get a divorce?
I don't know.
my sister left her husband last year.
as soon as she got a divorce, all men wanted to have sex with her.
the butcher proposed her.
then the baker and the greengrocer.
and even the beggars.
men are convinced that their thing is irresistible and that a divorced woman will accept since she's not a virgin anymore.
stay with your husbands long as you can.
something's wrong? Don't get yourself into such a state!
excuse me.
what is this sorrow for?
grandma!
it's terrible!
what's so terrible?
I think that... I think that I don't love Reza anymore.
I think we'll part.
so this is your terrible thing?
I thought somebody had died!
you've no idea what you're saying! I have a heart condition.
and you're talking to me like that!
all those tears for a simple divorce!
listen to me carefully.
I did it 55 years ago.
back then, no one was getting a divorce.
I knew that I would be happier alone than with a damned nuisance!
but... No buts!
a first wedding is a rough work for the second one.
it will be better next time.
you're crying because you were wrong.
it's hard to accept your own mistakes, isn't it?
where were you?
I was very worried.
nima is dead.
huh? What?
nima is dead.
I'm leaving you.
the time had come for me to leave.
I decided to go to France.
I had to wait 3 months for a visa.
I went to the Caspian sea with grandma where I filled my lungs with this unique air.
an air like nowhere else.
then I promised grandpa that he'd be proud of me.
then I went behind the prison where my uncle Anouche was resting, somewhere next to thousands of innocents.
I promised him to try to be true to myself as much as possible.
then, one day, the time to leave had come.
my father cried, as usual.
you're leaving forever. You're a free woman.
iran of today isn't for you.
I forbid you to come back.
Yes, mom. Grandma!
my sweet little girl!
I never saw my grandma again.
she died a little later.
freedom always has a price.
Ah! What a shitty weather!
where do you come from?
iran.
grandma, you always smell good. How are you doing?
I pick up jasmine flowers every morning and I put them in my bra.
this way, I always smell good.
Wow! It's great!
Yeah.
Yeah.
I get this really stupid employee discount at that restaurant.
if we walked over there, they'd pretty much give me an entre for free.
but that's not really my style, you know?
or we could head back to my place.
my shift doesn't start until 4: 00 tomorrow.
we could rent a movie or something.
like I said, I get paid by the mile.
sounds like that's a pretty dangerous job.
a lot more dangerous things if you made a list.
you got a list ? no, I don't have a list.
you sure you're not hungry?
do you wanna watch TV?
got to make it to Reno in the morning.
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Hey, listen.
I really appreciate the motel room.
it's not really my style to let the female pay.
and I don't want you to think that I just used you or anything.
I don't. Oh, okay.
that's good.
um, you want my e-mail?
take it easy.
Diane, it's Jenny Bell again -Len's fiance.
will you please call me back?
I really need to talk to you today.
Diane, call me.
saw your rig. Ladies night.
well, I guess you'll be getting some discounted drinks then.
just got paid. You're going with me.
I can't, Runner. I just got back.
you know it's a dream of every man in California...
have an opportunity to get drunk with you.
I'm not sure that's a compliment, Runner.
well, it ain't an insult. Come on.
it's that country-western crap? Seventies night.
seventies night at the V. F.W?
let me get my lipstick.
free BEER TOMORROW!
you just gonna sit there all night?
you gonna let me sit here all night?
we found the spark ,Oh, baby, you're glowing Started a fire Oh, baby, you're burning Looks like we made a soul connection We found a soul connection To find out. Find out. That what we have is real Have is real We had to find out. Find out That what we have is real To find out . find out. That what we have is real
this is fucking great. That's a pretty drink.
I'm going to the bathroom.
hey there.
hey there.
do you know me?
no, I don't know you.
maybe I could though if I tried real hard.
Yeah. Um
well, I'm Rick. I'm Runner's brother-in-law.
Oh. Rick.
Yeah, he's mentioned you. Oh, good.
Hey. Excuse me.
excuse me. he's married.
Yeah, but we're not fucking each other.
so excuse me. I'd like to avoid a bladder infection.
Oh, well, did you ever hear of that term, "playing with fire"?
Yeah. I think you're doing it right now.
no. You are. No. You are.
move it, shithead.
don't be a home wrecker now.
a good one.
Hey, Rick, how's it going?
not as good as you.
go home, Rick.
you're a lucky guy, Runner.
you're a real fucking lucky guy.
what the fuck do you have this thing set for?
what? That's Christian rock.
you caught me listening to Christian rock? Yeah.
it's soft rock. Have you ever heard of F. M?
there's a difference.
Oh, my God. What is this? This is reggae.
just don't go poking and banging at it like that.
basic radio, for Christ's sake. Don't punch it.
keep hitting the bottle.
what?
Jesus!
Oh, my wife's gonna kill me.
she's gonna have to stand in line.
slide over. God.
where you going? I'm suffering here.
Goddamn. You're really a bleeder.
kind of like what you're doing though. Shut up.
Oh, wait, wait. Here. Here.
here. Here.
hold it down. Are those- Shove 'em up in there.
I'm not putting tampons in my nose.
Yeah, that or bleed to that.
no, I'm not gonna do it.
Oh, yeah.
I wanna live.
Oh, God.
you're lucky I didn't bring the ones with the applicator in it.
shit.
just sit back now. You're gonna be fine.
Oh, I swear to God.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, you really did it this time.
this is the last time we're going out.
tonight was a wake-up call.
you lead a lonely life.
shut up, Runner.
you did that on purpose. Yeah, you think?
God, you're a heavy sack of shit.
why don't you settle down?
why don't you find Jesus?
what do you know about Jesus?
nothing.
then why do you suggest that I find him?
I don't know. I heard he makes people happy.
shut up.
Oh, you are dead weight.
okay.
you're gonna get me in trouble.
Diane? Yeah.
you're so pretty.
thank you, I think.
Oh, idiot.
Yeah. Nice, sis.
I told you, Molly. Shut up, Rick.
Diane! Hey!
what the hell are you doing?
who the hell are you? You know who I am.
I'm Jenny Bell. I've been calling you and writing you.
well, Jenny Bell, I don't check my messages all that often.
Diane, listen, Len's got an infection.
all right? And he's in the hospital for a few days.
and I have to leave tomorrow night to go to my mother's funeral.
so you can see I have somewhat of a dilemma.
Len and I have an agreement.
Yeah, well, it was Len's idea.
don't you have some neighbors or some friends or something?
I guess not.
all right, Diane, listen, you don't owe me anything, all right? But I can't work and take care of Len...
and go to my dead mother's send-off and watch your fucking kid right now.
Yeah, well, I'm on the road all the time.
it's three weeks for Christ's sake.
three weeks? Yeah.
Peter, come on over here. No.
Peter, come over here. No, Jenny.
no. Peter, come on.
Jenny.
fuck you. Peter, come on.
listen, we talked about this.
Peter, listen to me.
listen to me, all right?
it's just for a little while until your dad's feeling better.
all right? Listen. He loves you, and he needs you to do this for him.
can you do this for him?
all right? Say "okay." Come on.
thanks a lot, Diane.
I'm gonna call you in a few days, all right?
you're gonna stand there all night?
go on.
so you can crash right there, all right?
I'm gonna get this whole mix-up resolved tomorrow.
OK , I'm gonna go see Leonard in L. A.
runner will watch you.
he's my friend.
he'll probably be pretty hungover though.
Yeah.
so I just got the one-bedroom house.
just a one-bedroom.
don't like to talk,huh?
I don't like to talk to bitches.
fair enough.
you ever had a breakfast burrito before?
not bad for a dollar, twenty-nine.
I Come here nearly every day before work.
what do you do?
you ever heard of a jack-of-all-trades?
that's me.
actually, I'm more of a six of diamonds-of-all-trades.
you see those guys right over there?
I work with them sometimes.
aren't they illegal immigrants?
well, I guess it depends on who you ask.
Yeah. Sure.
it's good. Take a big bite.
it's full of eggs. You're gonna like it.
so your dad's got the big "C," huh?
sorry to hear about that.
Yeah, well, it's just in his colon. No big deal.
he'll get better. Yeah. Sure he will.
you'll go back to your old school and your pals, and your mom can get back to her regular life.
I hate my school, and I don't have any pals.
you got to have a best friend.
me and my dad are best friends.
well, I guess you're the sort of guy...
who's choosy about who he's buddies with.
I can relate to that.
I'm a bit of a lone wolf myself.
you're gonna use your hot sauce?
excuse me. I'm looking for Leonard Bonner's room, please.
it's Room 608, and it's right down the hall.
Thanks.
you got it? Got it.
you got the I. V. sweetie? I got it, baby.
damn it.
all right, we'll clean that up later.
does it hurt?
no. I'm all right. Just a little sore.
okay.
Hey, baby.
yeah? Can you get me some water?
three weeks.
don't you have a home?
me or him?
where you going? Oklahoma City.
get up. You're going with me.
Where's Oklahoma City? Take a guess.
I'm not going. I can take care of myself.
dude, I'm trying to pay my bills here, all right?
I don't have time to play nice right now.
well, then, why don't you ask me and not just tell me?
all right, listen, do you wanna go?
I don't know. Do you want me to go?
why don't you tell me if you wanna go?
you tell me first.
why don't you tell me first?
cause I was the one who asked first.
so? So that's how it works.
dude, man, I got to get on the road.
this is too much for me.
if you ask me and act like you want me to go, then I'll go.
all right, man, do you wanna go?
do you wanna go with me?
do you wanna go to Oklahoma City with me?
please.
I'll think about it.
everybody calls me the girl in the little pink Mack ?
the bumpers are chrome, and so are the wheels and the stack . it's got polka dot curtains hanging in a sleeper of pink Ha-ha, this Mack's a dandy Some kind of truck , they think In my truck-drivin' boots I stand about 5 foot 3
but don't let the size fool you Man, I can take care of me When you see a flash of pink go flying by the next thing ,you know there's a taillight in your eye .Everybody wonders who'd drive such a rig like that All the truckers would ask "Who's the gal in the little pink Mack
big country, huh?
stay in the truck.
what's up? Just about everything, darling.
Hey, you see a little kid around?
Hey, you see a little shit of an 11-year-old boy roaming around here?
Hey! You seen an 11-year-old kid running around here?
he might be over there.
shit.
God ,damn it. You little goddamn shit.
what the hell are you doing out here?
I was just looking around.
do you understand what this fucking place is?
it's people coming in and out of here from God knows where.
they'd like nothing better than to get their grimy little hands on your pretty little face.
you're crazy. Damn it. I told you to stay in that truck.
listen, I'm sorry I smacked you, all right?
but I don't wanna be reading about you in the newspaper tomorrow morning.
okay?
let's go. I don't feel like it yet.
listen to me.
I wanna make the New Mexico line by nightfall, all right?
I want my on-time bonus.
so? My ass hurts now, and I just feel like sitting.
you got two minutes.
you give Len this much trouble?
I don't make trouble.
people make trouble for me.
ever get into fights?
kids picking on me, calling me names.
I don't care.
you ever win?
I just freeze up. Whatever. I'll go back there soon, and you won't have to worry about anything.
I'm not worried about anything.
it seems weird for a woman to be driving a truck.
Yeah, well, what should I be doing?
I don't know. Something else.
Yeah, well,
I like being my own boss.
I own that truck. I paid it off this year.
it's a hell of a lot better than being a nurse or a waitress or something. Wiping tables or wiping asses.
just seems pretty lonely and boring.
Yeah.
not everyone's cut out like everyone else.
come on. New Mexico's calling.
wait up.
why are you walking so fast?
I wanna get my on-time bonus.
give it a rest, kid.
why are we stopping? Get some sleep.
where? Back there in the bunk. Where else?
I am not sleeping back there.
no way. I wanna stay at a hotel. Oh, damn it.
there are only a couple of reasons to get a hotel room when you're out on the road, and this ain't one of them..0
get your ass back there.
shouldn't you brush your teeth or something?
I don't have a toothbrush.
yeah? Well, what have you been using then?
my finger. Yeah? How's that?
that's disgusting. You're gonna catch something like that.
well, give me some money, and I'll go across the street.
I saw a store.
hey ! that's my shit. That's personal.
not anymore.
Hey, dude! Dude! Listen to me.
you can't go out there by yourself.
dude, it's dark out there.
faggot. Go buy me something.
do you think he'll buy you something?
Hey, homo, what did you get us? Nothing, dickhead.
What'd you just say?
shit, man, what did you do that for?
I wasn't- I was trying-- Hey, come back here!
dude, I wasn't trying to do that.
who did that? Who?
some boys across the street.
Hey! Wha
you fucking better watch who you fuck with!
all right? You got it!
fuck was that?
and a pack of generics.
I'll get dressed.
I know it hurts, son.
you could hold his hand.
sorry.
here you go.
you drink coffee?
Yeah. Why not?
Thanks. I like a lot of cream.
can we stop and see some stuff along the way?
we already lost half a day.
right.
that's a good stick you got there.
Thanks.
Oh, no, you didn't.
get back here. Hey!
Hey, Diane!
just hang tight, all right?
okay, we're all set, honey.
great. I just can't give you your on-time pay.
Jonnie, I always deliver early.
I know. My boss just won't let me
Jon, that's a bunch of bull shit.
is that your kid, honey? Yeah, it's my kid.
but I'm gonna be rid of him in less than a month.
all right? He lives with his dad.
does he go to school? No, he don't go to school.
Yeah, Di, but federal law and all. Jon, I need new tires.
look, it's been a little light here.
I'll call you when we get something in.
right.
all right, let's go.
and I'll be rid of you in a month too. Bitch.
I didn't mean that.
you didn't say one word since Texas.
you think it's easy being stuck in a cab with an 11-year-old who doesn't say anything?
well, it ain't easy, all right? It'll drive a person crazy.
dude, and that's what you're doing right now, man.
living with you will drive me crazy.
listen, you have no idea what my life was like before you got here. And you walked through this door and expect everybody to roll right over for you.
I didn't ask for your dad to get cancer, and I didn't ask for you to show up either.
then why did you have me then?
I didn't wanna have you, goddamn it.
I didn't mean that.
I wanna see my dad, and I'm gonna tell him everything.
everything!
Hey! Hey! I got a name, bitch!
you stop calling me that. I am not a bitch.
look, I knew what you were
just a lot lizard tramping around in dirty truck stops.
that's not what I was, dude.
you little shit.
that's not what I was.
God ,damn you.
that's not what I was.
dad!
Wow. I missed you.
how you been? All right?
dad, I'm gonna get some ice cream.
Hey, get some whip cream on mine.
okay. I'll get some too.
you know, after you took off,
I planned on how it was gonna be when I saw you again.
well, 10 years later, this ain't it.
you look fine.
you dating anybody?
dating? Yeah.
you ever think about marrying again?
to who? Not me, I guess.
I'm not very good future husband material these days.
Yeah, you'll be making Jenny miserable soon enough.
so did he turn out at all like you thought he would?
he looks like you, doesn't he?
he did when he came out, so I figured he'd stay that way.
what the hell are you trying to pull, Leonard?
listen, Diana, I
I had no choice. All right? I
I couldn't find anybody to take him.
well, when is Jenny coming back?
she's staying with her dad a little bit longer.
I can't keep asking her to watch after him all the time anyway.
I mean, she's got to work too. I need your help.
I'm talking about a month maybe.
I'm on the road two weeks at a time, sometimes more, Len.
I'll pay you.
fuck you ,damn it.
you always knew just what to say to make me wanna break your neck.
we made this arrangement 10 years ago.
Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did.
I know. Ten years ago, and that's that.
so shut the hell up, cause you're gonna be just fine.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
they're all white trash out here.
Yeah, but they're California white trash, and they all got suntans.
listen, I got to make that run, but I won't be back too late.
I'm trusting you now, right?
runner will check in on you. I'll be fine.
Hey. hey, Runner.
what are you doing?
I thought I'd finally build that gate for your mom...
so she can lock up her stuff when she's doing long trips.
wanna help me? Oh, I'm not great at stuff like that.
Ah, everybody's good at stuff like this. It's easy.
and it makes you feel good even if you do it half assed.
here. Hang on to this.
I'm good.
trust me. You're gonna love this. It's lots of fun.
I don't wanna mess it up. Here.
making mistakes is the only way you learn.
and trust me. I learn like four or five things every day.
all right.
grab a bunch, slap it on the edge, just like you're putting icing on a cake.
your mom is gonna be real surprised when she gets back from Phoenix.
she's been doing a lot of short hauls lately, hasn't she?
I guess. Perfect.
all right. Grab one of these.
try to set it down nice.
a little more that way. Like that?
uh- Good.
you know...
when I was a kid, my folks got divorced.
I tell you, the best day of my life was when my dad left.
now he had the meanest left hook.
never could see it coming.
think that's why I did so good in the army.
Diane said you got shot.
Yeah. And it hurt like a son of a bitch. Still does sometimes.
so what are you in grade six now? Yeah.
you into that new school? there's this kid I like.
I might try out for baseball even though I suck. Yeah?
baseball's good, sure. Your dad used to play, right?
Yeah. your mom told me.
she used to go watch him.
your mom's pretty good with a glove. Should ask her.
probably give you a few pointers. Yeah, maybe.
all right, man, you just gotta lean into it, okay?
really, really lean into it. All right.
what was that?
Oh, my God. I thought it was gonna get me.
you just gotta keep your eye on it.
all right, I'll be easy on you this time.
Hey, Are you trying to kill me?
I didn't say walk into it. Let's do it again.
I'm afraid of you.
what's there to be afraid of? Come on.
just don't get crazy with that thing.
I didn't mean that.
God , damn it!
dude! Dude! Dude, that is not cool.
I got to go. Yeah.
but listen. You have to take a swing at that thing if you wanna get anywhere.
I just wanna hit it. That's all I wanna do.
you can hit a home run. No, I can't.
I know what I can do and what I can't.
why, because somebody tells you so?
no, because I know so. And you think you're so tough.
trying to tell everyone what to think.
but you're the one who's always scared of stuff.
you're the scaredest person I know.
nice gate you got going here. Well, it's a start.
you know, I was thinking maybe you and me and Peter, we could all do something together, you know?
go dirt biking or something.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Yeah. Pretty dangerous. Yeah.
what's he doing right now?
watching TV.
seems to be taking to it out here a little bit.
Yeah, he'll be back in L. A. soon enough.
Yeah.
you know, I lived in this house six years? Yep.
I'm gonna own it someday. That's right.
you agree too much. Am I agreeing?
Yes, I'm agreeable.
stop looking at me, man.
you want something from the store?
Nah.
I'll get on that gate. I'll finish it soon.
come on. Get up now.
turn off the TV.
Why?
go brush your teeth.
what are you doing? I'm trying to be nice here.
okay.
this is my blanket.
here. It's your dad's.
it's pretty raggedy, but, uh, you can have it to sleep with.
I don't sleep with stuffed animals.
it's a clown actually. But I know.
okay. Good night, then.
Diane? Yeah?
dad said that when he was on the road with his team...
he stopped off in Needles, California, and saw you at a truck stop.
Yeah, well, flat broke.
you know how that can be.
he said you were the most beautiful girl he ever saw.
he said that, huh?
I was 18. All 18-year-olds girls are beautiful.
he said you didn't leave because of me.
but I know you did.
it wasn't you particularly that made me leave.
it's just that your dad's a man, and a man's man to a fault.
and a man like that expects a woman to do a whole bunch of things I wasn't prepared to do.
like what? Like staying around the house...
and being like a-like a woman everybody's used to.
what's wrong with staying around the house?
some people like staying around the house and some people don't.
doesn't make you a bad person, right?
does Jenny stay around the house? No.
see? But she wants to.
me and your dad were staying in this bungalow we rented in Hollywood.
it was a pretty nice place, you know?
I'm getting kinda tired, kid. Okay.
I don't know.
you know, I've been thinking about it and...
being in that house holding you or feeding you a bottle or something, and it was like I was half there.
you know? It was like I had this body, but it wasn't mine, and I just moved it around or something.
and then one day you were both asleep and I just...
took the money I was saving and I just left.
did you love me? It's getting pretty late.
I got an early start in the morning.
you comfortable?
Yeah. Good.
well, good night.
good night.
when are you moving back with your dad?
I don't know. Probably about a couple of months maybe.
do you like staying at your mom's? Not really.
but she's not around that much. What does she do?
she drives a big rig, which is a truck, and she goes all over the states, you know.
right now, she's actually going on a trip to San Diego.
she is? Yeah.
what are you doing after school?
all right, do you know what a whippet is?
okay, okay. First time, keep it easy.
what the hell are you doing?
Oh, shit. You, who the hell are you? Out!
get the hell out. Out.
Ah, fuck this. But this is my house too.
the hell it is. Jesus.
you're bullshit. You're bullshit, all right?
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
you see what happened to me?
Oh, shit!
Oh, you little fucker! You get- Oh, fuck!
Oh ! you better run!
Oh, shit! Run! Run!
you little bastard.
well, at least he's got a friend. Yeah, I don't know.
he wanted to stay over there tonight, but I didn't think it was such a good idea.
don't let it bother you. Kids do shit like that all the time.
hell, I did it. Look how I turned out.
inspire me, why don't you?
shit. What do you know about raising kids?
you're barren or sterile or shooting blanks or whatever.
sometimes I think you'd just best be served by just...
closing your mouth every once in a while, just walk away once in a while.
you gotta wife to talk to like that.
I'm ain't your wife. Yeah, but you and me are friends.
I won't let my other pals talk to me like that.
don't think it's a little strange you and me going out all the time?
it's not all the time. We're neighbors, for Christ's sake.
it's important for people to have other interests, you know?
friends and such. I'm your only friend, Runner.
I got friends, Diane. I got pals I served with.
well, the guys on line down at the V. A. don't count, dude.
Oh, wow, you really
that don't make me feel too good.
just keep on drinking that creamy drink there, Runner.
it happens to be in a to-go cup, and I'm to-going.
come on. Runner!
what are you littering for? Give a hoot, man.
you just can't -You don't see it. See what?
forget it. Where are you going?
you know, I don't care if you just see me as some jerk who follows you around like a dog.
what do I care? But damn it, I'm crazy about you, Diane.
I'm crazy about you too, Runner. You know that.
but I'm not gonna let you get in my underpants.
Yeah, why not me? Why every other dumb Joe Blow?
it's not every other dumb Joe Blow.
we've been hanging around for four years.
we've been going out. We've been palling around.
and I ... You can be really nasty sometimes.
but I've never thought about a woman the way I think about you.
well, go ahead. I'm waiting for the commentary.
hell, Runner, I'm not gonna say anything.
I better go.
I got a secret I shouldn't tell and I'm gonna go to heaven in a In a split-pea shell. Lordie, Didn't we shake sugaree Everything I have Down in pawn You know I pawned my watch I pawned my chain, yeah, And I'd of sold myself But I felt ashamed Lordie me Didn't we shake up sugaree Everything I have Down in pawn
okay, let's do it!
Yes, get a hit!
Hey, you made it. Yeah.
let's go! Let's go! Yeah!

Peter, let's go! You can do it!
okay, let's a hit! Come on, Peter!

what the hell's he doing?
over here!
did you see me? I hit it. Yeah.
I saw it.
kept your eye on the ball.
Hey, come on. Don't be talking like that.
all right, put the porno on and, uh, I'll grab some plates.
which one you putting in first?
Hello? Nice.
this is Diane. Cause if it's a scary movie
I gotta have a blanket. It's gotta cover my feet. Yeah.
and it has to wrap underneath. It has to be like a taco.
I see. I have to be wrapped like a burrito.
now listen.
if my mom was alive or I knew where my dad was,
I would try to fix things up with them, but
I've been talking to Jenny, and she's gonna take him, Di.
but I don't want you to talk to him about it just yet, okay?
I'll just let him be.
does she really want him?
wants him enough, I guess.
you sent him out to me on purpose.
you've known for a long time how sick you were.
I wish we could've seen eye to eye on some things, Diane.
that would have been cool with me.
I just never knew where I stood.
like I was right there with you or making love to you, but you were always somewhere else.
I could never get a foothold.
there I was.
you pulled up in that big bus with your team, you stepped off.
I thought I'd never seen a better looking man in all my life.
seemed like you came down from heaven or on a white horse or something.
you had your hair slicked back, cut over your left eye.
I would've gone just about anywhere with you at that moment, and I guess I did.
you did. That's very true.
I like that mouth.
your dad wants you to come in now.
your dad wants you, okay?
Peter, go on. We'll be right here when you get back.
come on now. Go.
well, I guess you can tell by looking at me
I'm not in the best shape of my life.
you look all right. You win your game?
come on. Come sit next to me.
I got some things that I wanted to talk to you about.
how's your throwing?
bad. Yeah, well,
I wasn't so good at throwing either.
or batting, for that matter.
you like your mom?
no.
you love her though, right?
I don't know.
now I gotta tell you this, sweetheart.
I'm not so sure that I'm gonna be seeing you around again before too long.
now me and you, we've been together since you were a baby, right?
that's a long time. That's a real long time.
you know, when you first came out of your mom, well...
it was the happiest day of my life.
now here, here. Stop playing with your fingers for a second and look at me, okay?
no. Now listen to me good, okay?
I want you to try and be a good man, if you can.
and I don't mean giving quarters to homeless people or whatever. I'm talking about...
treating people right, you know?
or... I don't know, standing up for people that need you.
even if you're scared.
all right, do you know what I'm saying?
no. You do those things.
maybe if all goes well,
I'll be sure to see you before too long, all right?
go get Jenny, cause she needs to make some calls.
No! Go on. Go-Go get Jenny.
no, Daddy!
wilderness song Kids and a clown Lanky boys with Big mouths My staircase A vow leans against my cloud And all your wanderin'

I am dependable.

Yeah, sure, that would be fun.
no, a drink would be great. Thank you.
okay.
thank you.
you sound like a real rock star in there.
listen, I'm gonna need you to go stay with Jenny another weekend in, uh, L. A. okay?
next weekend. I'm gonna go do Reno.

Peter!
who's up? Who do we got? Let's go! Next batter!
Hey! Hi.
that was great. Thanks.
Hey, Peter. How are you? Hi, Jenny.
I thought you weren't coming until tomorrow.
Where's Runner? Bringing the truck around.
listen, Peter, I've gotta work tomorrow afternoon, so I was thinking we just drive back to L. A. tonight.
well, me and the team are gonna go get some pizza.
I got a call a few hours ago to make another run after Reno.
where? Boston.
Where's Boston? It's gonna be a couple extra days, so maybe you wanna stay out there with Jenny a little while longer, okay?
how long? A few days.
just an extra few days.
and then we'll see. Okay?
see what?
it's just a few days.
a few days, okay?
listen to me.
you can go back and be with your friends, all right?
you can stay in your old house.
you can have a better life.
you can be with people who love you.
see, I am who I am, all right?
this is who I am. I'm always gonna be like this.
like what? Like this.
Jenny is a really nice woman.
I don't want a nice woman.
I'll be back in a week or so. Just play it by ear or something.
okay, Diane.
he's a good boy.
I know.
how you doing, Jenny?
to tell you the truth, I'm pretty fucking sad.
I'll bring him by in the morning.
he'll be fine.
good night, Diane.
Yeah.
you did good tonight.
I could have been a good dad, maybe.
maybe still could.
what?
nothing.
you look real pretty tonight.
yeah? Yeah.
Thanks.
I like your legs.
never get to see 'em much.
actually I don't think I ever seen them.
yeah? My legs? Yeah.
what else do you like about me?
I like your knees.
my knees are a part of my legs, the part that makes them bend.
can't it just be me saying something?
just say something else then. You already got my legs covered.
what would you say if I leaned in a little right now?
I guess I'd tell you when you got here.
not sure if I like it.
no?
maybe a little closer.
can't quite get the full bouquet of the whiskey.
no. Diane, I'm sorry.
no, it's not you.
I just don't want to live like that anymore.
like what?
kinda half-assed, you know? Not thinking things through.
I mean, you got Molly, she's okay, but damned if you're ever gonna leave her.
I don't know what I'm doing.
but whatever it is maybe I've gotta think about my future more than just what city I'm running a load of two-by-fours to, you know? You know what I mean, Runner?
not all the way. But, yeah, I gotcha.
I can support you on that.
you better go. He's gonna be home soon.
you gonna say something?
Diane, you got the most beautiful tits I ever laid hands on.
well, if nothing else, you
you're a true gentleman.
stay out of trouble.
what are you guys doing?
how was the game?
get out of here.
okay.

how's your health?
the air is really nice here and raising fruits is fun
the air is nice here too, What did you say?
nothing, I made it here okay

Oh, yeah
did Young-min call you? Young-min?
Yeah, l guess he only told me
he said he's coming this fall

he only called twice ever since he left
how could he resemble his father so much? I can never understand
are you listening? Yes

Yeah, I'll call you later I have to go, bye

have you eaten breakfast?
not yet Have to eat with Hyun-soo
Oh yeah, I'll do that favor you asked
the C. G. team said they'll help
Really? Thank you so much
you're that happy?
thanking me isn't enough
then what?
after it's televised, move to sketching
I told you I'd think about it
how many more years do you need to think?
you've worked too long in animation Think about the people underneath you
think about the people underneath you have to move up fast so they can, too
always on time
give it careful thought .
see you late,r You bet
the character on your desk is the one, right?
nice job.
hello Hello
boy friend?
it's a secret.
Soo-gyung, anything from sketching? Not yet, Wanee
anyway, why aren't you going to sketching part?
you that curious? If it were me, I'd go
you can create your own work there.
Yeah, I don't get Wanee at all I'm sick of drawing the same picture
sketching is nothing Animation is the best
right? High-five!
they don't know what's important Animation is essential
not a hundred sketches Animations move because of us
but sketching is the best
if Wanee transfers, who'll take her place? You're right
what? Don't you know already?
I'll do my best
boss, Good luck with your new job
I'll do all the cleaning Just don't kick me out
well. Then wash the rag
a wild journey to find a lost love
it's okay Honestly, I like it
the story and characters are well-developed
but does it have to be a road movie?
this genre doesn't do well
sir, that's what I thought at first
but a road movie is more original
the audience is opening up to new genres, so we can market it easily
Junah, what do you think?
well
people's minds are complex
so the truth is hard to find
writing something fun like this
so you're the prank caller
you can't even talk.
daddy You can say daddy
what's your name?
Hello?
it's you again
you shouldn't make prank calls
isn't this Lee Wanee's home?
sorry, it is But she's still at work
who's speaking? Pardon?
Yes, I'm living with her
who should I say called?
her brother You mean the one in Europe
I'll call later Hello? Wailt
my name is Kim Junah A-ha
taste good? It's delicious
wine and seafood soup go really well together
I made what you liked.
why haven't you made this delicious meal before?
it's not for any occasion I made it cause it's a special day
it's been a year since we first met
you rememered?
here
but I didn't prepare anything It's alright
since you often forget your umbrella, where this instead
so your hair won't get wet
does it look funny? Nope
Oh yeah, your brother called Young-min, I think
I brought over an answering machine
and I thought it was a prank again He probably called to say he'll be back
he's coming back? When?
this fall
Really?
it's been a while, right? About three years?
when he comes, I'll leave
I left my house in Seoul too long, and my script is almost done
he might not come here
he'll probably go to Seoul all his friends are there
here is our next song
kim ln-sook, been waiting long?
she asked to play this song at one Here goes her request
I told you to knock
and do you have to stomp your feet? You know you heard me coming
what do you want?
I heard you did laps for drawing again.
how did you know?
so-young told me, So-young.
where did you meet her?
Yeah, I wonder why she came to my school.
turned the clock an hour ahead again?
you knew?
why did you do that? It feels like we're living an hour too fast
anyway, the winder is loose, so it'll return to normal
want to grown up fast? Of course
you like the present? I'm not sure
it's strange ,What is?
why does it smell different here? Did you put on perfume?
Nope
smell something? Just because
maybe a girl's scent?
where are you going?
my room.
some girl is really lucky ,Why?
sorry girls
I told him not to come Crazy chick is at it again
you already got hurt today cause of a guy
did you see that? Come on
Wanee!

don't worry!
you better hook me one! Got it?
let's go
just a little longer
I'm going first
she'd want coffee
you guys are good
wouldn't it be fun if we went to a club? Are you on some bus tour?
Jung-woo Salute!
Hi, What is that?
here's a sketch
already? How come a sketch is out so soon?
look at the calender wrong?
Hey!
think it's fun getting pressed for time and working hard?
look how much my face , how rotted
who are the ones who have to rush to make the deadline?
look at Do-suk , Does he look twenty-four?
anyway, where's Wanee?
Wanee
so-young
wow, your hair's so long
Wanee ,A snail
Wanee How.
I'm sorry, I got you all wet
are you okay?
just like the old days I haven't been here since I moved to Seoul
a lot has changed, huh?
well, lt definitely has changed, but I feel at ease like the old days
are you still catching colds during summer? No, there's not enough ice
remember?
when it was hot, you laid under the covers, and wanted ice cream
Young-min and I always ran errands for you
it hasn't been long, but it sounds like yesterday, huh?
it has been long the past
Plus, I don't catch colds anymore during summer
here to take pictures?
I've taken a break from school
I keep putting off graduation
actually, I don't know what to do
majoring in photography doesn't mean I'll be one.
I like pictures, of course
but it scares me to think I'll make a living off of it
Wanee, can I stay here for a few days?
I didn't tell dad yet about school
you know how he needs time to calm down
so I'll call him later
I won't get in the way
I'll nail myself on the second floor
he seems to be a writer ,Can I ask about you two?
you're not married, right? No, we just live together
Wanee, you sure are brave
Hello, I'm Yoon So-yang I'm Wanee's old friend
I'll be here for a few days
Hi, I'm Kim Junah
Yong-min, let go
I'm letting go ,No! No! My jaw will break!
that was harsh ，20 seconds 2 seconds alone
what's two seconds? I was scared my jaw would break
if continue like this,Your arms will turn into a dinosaur's You're terrible
chin-ups are out , Let's move on
come on, Wanee, I'm dying ,4 meters for discus and 5 sit-ups And terrible at running laps
stop running , or she'll fall two laps behind
I feel like dying
it's okay
you scored one or two points
but you still get good grades
Young-min, I want ice cream I'll buy it
what? Ask nicely
Wanee, ll buy some ice cream
okay, give me money
she'll fail her PE test I'm worried
you two look good together
what does that mean?
if not, then don't lead her on ,What did I do?
So-yang has feelings for you
so don't toy with her, Stop, that's enough
which finger?
the middle one
it's past two, Not sleeping?
of course
So-yang won't stay here long
is that what's keeping you awake?
no
is it okay that I stay here?
why are you worried, honey?
honey? I haven't heard that in a while.
say it again
no
I'll be busy from tomorrow , Might be up all night at the office
close to the deadline, I see
what are you doing?
I like your scent
know this?
after couples break up, remembering the scent is unbearable
how will I to bear it again?
not answering the phone?
I'm just wanna sleep
it might be your brother , He said he'll call back
help yourself, and cut down on cigarettes
vegetables are in the fridge , Heat the soup for lunch
I heard you're writing a script
pardon? Right
what is it about?
it's a fun story
must be a secret
I haven't told Wanee yet, either
there's a woman wandering between love and separation
it's a road movie about his conflict
how did you meet Wanee?
we met by fate , Someone introduced us
no way, How is that fate?
is Wanee your first love?
how could you ask me that? How could she be my first experience?
I asked if she was your first love
no, that's not what I meant
when I was about seven, I think
there was this girl in my neighborhood
my heart would pound whenever I saw her
I just remembered
how is that your first love?
you kidding me? By that age, kids know everything
one time, she was crying naked in front of her door
I mean how bad was she to make her mom do that
then I passed her by, and our eyes met
but she looked at me spitefully
I mean what did I do wrong?
you should've told me
have some coffee ,Thank you
it seems nice.
you and Wanee living together without anyone to bother you
it seems really nice
envious, huh?
not answering the phone?
I wanna see who it is first
this is the film company, Kim Junha
I want talk to you, please call me
Hello? Sorry
Why?
I need some help , you pose for me?
like this? Raise your knee
better? Rest your back
good
what? Your eyebrows are crooked
Really? Yes
I'm not good at doing my eyebrows, Want me to do it?
you? Yeah
do it right ? yes
do it right ? stay still
you better ? okay
Wanee
can you flip the record?
you scared me ,What are you doing there?
getting some sun
are you allowed to come in here?
you haven't been in here? No
I thought it was locked
there's a lot of records here
I didn't know she collected albums
it's not hers ,Young-min and Wanee bought them together, whenever they got their allowance
a lot of them are mine, too
Really?
the sailboat in the living room Young-min made it, too
he was a model maniac
seeing that he's meticulous, he looks fragile
that's when he was young He looks more manly now
his hands were so pretty when he made that boat
now I get it
you liked him a lot, right?
Yes.
he was quiet, but kind and mature
I heard he's coming back
I know.
what are you doing here?
Hey. You're home early?
why are you in someone else's room?
I opened it and came in
I wanted to see Young-min's room , I'm sorry
wouldn't it be nice to put the stereo in the living room?
when Young-min arrives, we can listen to it then
so I can use this notebook as a phone simultaneously?
you can us it as a phone, and pick different melodies
what's the score? Eight to eight
let's talk first
Hyun-soo! Hyun-soo!
Hyun-soo's mother wants him to get married
it's not like him, I can't understand
then why did you two fight?
he wants to separate for a while
Wanee ! daddy ! Wanee!
you must be Young-min
from now on, I'm your mother
what are you doing?
Oh, Wanee Tada, I bought it
isn't it great? The picture's great
and the sound is no joke, too
I got it on a six-month installment
it's expensive, but I'll sign a contract by then
so let's eat only three meals a day
turn it down , I need some sleep
Oh, sure
I think she's mad
no
you don't need to send me off , Go back inside
are you mad?
no
tell me , you seem mad
I said I'm not
how much is it?
I'll take care of it
I'm gonna watch it, too I'll take care of the bill
so go back in
I have some money left over, so don't worry
you should've bought a laptop instead of thinking of others
others?
talk to me first before you buy anything. Bye
that's what happened
you know they've been friends for ten years
he trusts him the most
so what did the director think?
he's emphasizing the love triangle By focusing on the lovers' emotions
and changing the main character's job
that much?
he's practically rewriting it
above all, it's about the two main characters
that's what he wants
frankly, he doesn't want it to be a road movie
honestly, l...
couldn't they ask me to do it?
you know he only works with Bak Gi-hwan
anyway, you'll get original story credit
I guess it's been decided
you're not even here to ask for my permission
Junha, making your debut is very important
getting your name out is essential
Mrs. Kim
no, friend Let me ask you one thing
do I have to give up at this point?
I'm sorry
I'll wire you the money
what? Then when will you be home?
no, I just called to talk
it's raining a lot
aren't you cold sleeping there?
okay, take care
bye
thank you , Sure
kim Junah!
it's not raining anymore
what happened to your other umbrella?
damn, it went back in Mr. Kim, the writer
cuttlefish again?
what's that title for? Please don't call me that
got any sea slugs? Of course
you haven't been around lately , Stop drinking?
how could I ever? Since I've been writing hard lately
yeah? Does Wanee know you're cheating on her?
pardon?
both of you must come here often
it's on the way home
I envy her
you wait for her regardless You drink togehter on the way home
you didn't date Young-min like this?
we were a bit strange , All three of us hung out together
Wanee...
it was fun , But we never had memorable moments alone
Mr. Kim, the writer
is writing scripts fun?
sometimes it's fun, but mostly it's hard
somebody said,
don't make something you like to do a job , It's good to enjoy it for what it is
Wanee said that, right?
no, I heard it from Young-min
one more bottle
want some more food? No thanks
know this?
from what I see, Junah.
we can be frank now, right?
I think you like Wanee more than she does
you think so?
don't be too nice to her
then she'll like you less the more you do
know this?
I loved that person, but he loved someone else
even though he didn't say it
be careful
wanna go bicycling? What?
are you that drunk? Where's a bike at this hour?
this bike is really awesome
is something wrong?
sorry for drinking so much What?
why isn't it moving?
why isn't it moving?
what happened to the road here?
they woke up next door
what's going on out there?
forgive us
sorry, sorry
Wanee, Someone's asking for you
the Wind's Memory written by Kim Junah
are you tired?
Why? Does it show?
how's work?
I must have no talent
I haven't even done half yet
regret going to college? not at all
don't make something you like to do a job , You'll hate it later on
I don't care
and you? Then you'll marry the second girl you like
also
I'm studying abroad
can't you see I'm changing?
what do you want to hear? Good choice. Go do your best
is that it?
let's go together
are you okay? You look exhausted
Yeah, I'm alright

you and Junah look really good together Like brothers and sisters
did you come here because of Young-min?
yeah
you should've came when he's here
I just missed you too

that you sent Young-min away
that if it wasn't for you, he wouldn't have left
although I know it's not true
I know but.
Young-min
you know , he's my brother
that's all
I'm not sure anymore

Young-min, why are you in a rush?
I wish we can be together longer

and the army?
I'll go later, dad.

Young-min , No dad, nothing's wrong

I liked your script

give it here
don't laugh.
stop playing around
let's go

you like comics so much you steal from my purse?
get out now , Don't ever come back
I'm sorry, mommy Please forgive me
lights. Flashing.
there was an accident on the Svarte Road.
cars with lights are all taken.
she's out there.
you see her?
Oi! Mind my bloody crop!
Hello?!
Hello?!
it's all right, I just want to talk!
it's all right. Please.
Hello? Yes.
police.
really, it's all right.
just want to talk.
it's OK.
police! Just...
just want to...
no, no, no, no! Stop!
stop! Stop! Stop!
stop!
what do we do with the farmer?
get him to the hospital. He's gone into shock.
he's no good to us here.
there's a trail leading through the rape to the barn.
must've got the petrol there.
OK. So Let's check the barn. See if we can find any trace of her in there, find out what was she doing here.
someone must be missing her.
this was round her neck.
initials "DMS."
we'll need it for ID.
she was...
...trembling. She was...
she was terrified.
what of?
me.
show me the tracks.
Hi, Dad! - Hi.
come in, come in.
God, this place is squalid!
dad, forget it.
give us a hug.
how's Mum?
Yeah, fine.
what have you got him, then?
who?
granddad. I've got him some mittens. They're really cool.
he can still paint with them on, see?
remember when I went out with Lukas?
he used to play the bass wearing these things!
you haven't even thought about it, have you?
just because he's got Gertrude now doesn't mean you can dismiss him from your mind.
well, I've got till Sunday. I'll nip out tomorrow.
God, Dad, you are such complete crap sometimes, you know?
Yeah.
dms was 163cm high, never broken a bone, good teeth.
probably only 15.
what could drive her to do that?
what that girl did was a completely unnatural act.
everything in her mind and body would have been screaming against it.
15?
it's like these kids who self-harm now.
what was that boy you told me about earlier?
seven-year-old. Tried to cut his thumb off.
we had a five-year-old in recently - tried to put his own eyes out.
at least that's what it looked like.
what kind of a world are we leaving a 15-year-old girl that she would burn herself to death?
but the world watches us for the new way.
and now we've fallen by the wayside, like everyone else.
we opened up our society, and our prime minister was assassinated coming home from the cinema, so, yes, you could argue that instead of the world joining us, we joined the world.
which is, of course, not to say that everything we sought to achieve has failed.
I think the world now recognises that Sweden and skinny-dipping in mountain lakes.
a perfect cue for me to bring in my final guest...
I keep seeing her face.
the way she looked at me.
well, maybe she thought you were someone else.
you know?
the Crime Bureau have a database for abbreviations and acronyms, haven't they?
Yeah, but I wouldn't want to be the schmuck who has to trawl through that lot.
for three letters? God.
Oh, right. It's me, isn't it?
a small axe, I'd say. Single blow.
almost split his skull in two.
dead before he hit the ground. - It's messy.
Yes, it's too messy.
the axe was sharp, a clean hit.
but look here.
there's a lump of skin missing.
there's been another cut.
with a knife, I'd say. Quite crude.
scalped? What's going on?
was he robbed?
his wallet's in his pocket. He was still wearing his watch.
what about the house?
there's no obvious disturbance.
Oh, the press didn't hang about, did they? - Christ.
celebrity. Ex-politician. This is going to be massive.
it's OK. I'll take them.
you just give them the basics, yeah?
we'll... leave the scalping for now.
whatever you want. Tell me what you need.
outside help, backup - just let me know.
this is in your hands, Kurt.
right, you go and pester Nyberg.
we need a time of death, even if it's a guess.
I'll do the house.
ladies and gentlemen...
we opened up our society, and our prime minister was assassinated...
which is, of course, not to say that everything we sought to achieve has failed...
Wetterstedt was always phoning about people pestering him on HIS beach.
but one guy, we did come out to. A real old piss-head, said he was a reporter.
old friend from the past?
just sat on the beach with a bottle of vodka, staring up at the house.
reporter...
so he said.
name?
there wasn't a reason to take his name, done nothing wrong.
Wetterstedt got pretty antsy about him.
the old guy just laughed.
his name might be in the book.
Thanks.
you know about you
so where were you last night?
you think I could kill anyone?
look at me.
there are reports of you hanging around... the house, the beach.
sure. I hang around.
a pair of eyes.
you can't arrest people for looking, can you?
not yet, anyway.
he finished you, didn't he?
my first editor taught me there are two kinds of reporters.
the ones who dig for the truth and the ones who try to bury it.
and Wetterstedt always had enough of the second kind to keep his back covered.
so what did you dig up?
he used to have a girl delivered each week to some secret bolt-hole.
fine! We're all grown-ups.
but then one of them reported him for, er...
...assault.
said she'd had her feet slashed with a razor.
she had the scars.
it all added up.
but... hey! This guy was the Minister of Justice.
he was the face of the Government, the good guy.
everyone loved him.
so... they paid off the girl.
what about the police?
what about the police?
it wasn't just the girls, though.
Wetterstedt thought he was cultured.
art.
he liked to be seen among the wealthy collectors.
we think he was scalped.
scalped. Jesus!
some... bizarre kind of trophy, I suppose.
maybe. - Yeah.
maybe not.
it can also be a sacrifice.
isn't that in the legend?
the Indian brave offers up the scalp as a gift to free another soul.
a soul that has been violated.
the warrior.
the brave.
any questions, ladies and gentlemen? - What is the reason for this attack?
well, I can tell you that we have ruled out the possibility of robbery.
it appears that this brutal attack is motiveless.
I don't think it was motiveless. If Magnusson's right,
Wetterstedt had enemies all over the place.
was there anything more from forensics?
garden light bulb covered in prints.
someone very careless or someone without previous who knows he's not traceable.
done it. The whole database.
the pendant, the letters. DMS?
And?
2, 014 permutations for what those letters might mean.
names, companies, websites...
let's... Let's give it to Interpol as well.
and Europol, or whatever it is they're calling themselves now. - Sure.
and let's get a photograph of that pendant in the newspaper.
someone must be missing that girl.
right.
what?
look, I was just wondering...
this Wetterstedt thing, I mean...
they're saying the guy was scalped.
I mean, this is big time. - So?
well, this girl, it's obviously a suicide, and that's, you know, tragic and sad and everything, but if no crime has been committed, - couldn't I work with you...?- 15-year-old girl burns herself to death.
you don't think that's a crime?
I suppose... if you put it like that, yeah.
well, how would you put it?
Hi.
Linda? - Hi.
Oh, you've eaten.
I waited. - It looks good.
it was.
...still pouring in this afternoon to the former Minister of Justice...
you should have called.
I did.
I didn't get a message. - I didn't leave one.
so are you on this Wetterstedt thing?
look, I know we said we might get over to see granddad today, but, er...
I went round to see him.
he's not great, Dad.
he was shut in his studio, scratching away at those canvases.
Gertrude says not to worry, but I don't think he's well.
we'll definitely get over tomorrow, I'll make some time somehow, - and we'll give him a treat. - It's like you just ignore him sometimes.
he is you Dad.
it's not that simple. - Yeah, tell me about it.
I can tell you that we have ruled out the possibility of robbery.
it appears that this brutal attack...
darling, people are missing you. - Hm.
I'm afraid I'm not able to disclose that...
the girl's arrived, the one you wanted to talk to.
I'll be right out.
...but police have so far not released further details of the killing...
it's an honour to be here.
perhaps we can meet at the gallery tomorrow.
it's a pleasure to be able to represent a young artist with your talent.
so... see you tomorrow. - Thank you.
I'm just going to... - I'll be in in a minute.
Yeah.
Yeah. OK.
same weapon, same wound. Same scalping.
just a bit tidier this time.
the wife and daughter are upstairs.
have you any idea who might have done this?
could it have been one of your guests?
how should we know?
what a stupid question! - Erika.
your husband was an art dealer, I believe.
did he have any... business enemies you were aware of?
this is such a waste of time.
it's obvious what happened.
some maniac came up through the garden and attacked him.
get out there and start looking.
you people are just a total waste of space.
Mrs. Carlman?
did your husband have any dealings with Gustav Wetterstedt, do you know?
none that I am aware of.
thank you.
this connection between Carlman and Wetterstedt.
the art thing, it sounds a bit tenuous.
well, it's all we've got at the moment.
the prosecutor's already been on.
we need to know what we're dealing with here, Kurt.
is this a serial killing? - I don't know.
maybe he was just after these two. It was consecutive nights.
it was pre-planned, I'm pretty sure about that.
maybe that was it.
the prosecutor is going to want to get a profiler in, you know that.
Where's she from?
it seems her father reported her missing some time in November.
her father?
well done.
Hi. Hi, it's me.
are you OK?
I didn't hear you go out.
it was the middle of the night, I didn't wanna wake you.
look, um...
you want me to get granddad a present for you?'
has something else happened, Dad?
OK, see you later. - No, it's j...
I think we've found something on Carlman.
he's done time.
he was accused of forging cheques and receiving stolen paintings.
he was innocent of both.
and you're sure of that?
Gustav Wetterstedt was Minister of Justice at that time.
are you sure that there was no connection between him and your husband?
why would there be contact between a minor offender - and the Minister of Justice? - Oh, come on! your husband wasn't just any minor offender.
he was already a wealthy man, he was a prominent man.
I don't know what it is you're trying to insinuate, Inspector.
and neither, I suspect, do you.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry to have bothered you.
these are very remarkable paintings.
idiot! You useless donkey! - Erika!
Erika! - Useless, useless donkey!
calm down. Calm down.
calm down.
I understand, I understand.
Jesus.
come on.
come on. Get up!
come on!
come on! Come on.
come on, wake up.
come on.
Oh, shit!
Carlman was one of that circle.
Wetterstedt had a few under his wing.
he looked after Carlman when he got out of prison.
cleaned up his name.
was he involved with Wetterstedt and the girls he had?
was he involved with the girls?! - Sure.
they all were. - Who else? Names.
I never got to the bottom of it.
OK. What about the police?
you said they tidied up after Wetterstedt. Who? All of them?
come on, I'm digging here! Lars?!
vice Squad.
where do I find him now?
who knows?
OK.
Thanks.
hang on, here we are.
hugo Sandin, Stockholm Vice Squad, retired 1987.
there's an address here. Hassleholm.
Mr. Sandin, please.
who shall I say?
a friend from the old days.
one moment, please. - Thank you.
who is it?
an old friend of yours. - What?!
I don't know you.
Wallander, Ystad Police.
Ystad?
someone lost their cat?
we can talk out here or I can come in.
you know about Gustav Wetterstedt and Arne Carlman?
of course I know about them, it's everywhere.
you're not bothered?
why should I be bothered? It happens.
they were scalped. Both of them.
what does that say to you?
someone in Ystad finally found some balls.
what do you want with me?
you know what I want with you. Wetterstedt and Carlman.
girls, art fraud. You tidied up after them.
two murders and you're nowhere.
I'm here, and I want names. Others involved with them.
if this maniac is working through a list, I need to know who's on it.
you think I might be?
well, it depends what you did.
and how much someone might want to bury an axe in your skull.
well, I'll tell you something... what was your name?
I'm a patriot. I love this country.
openness, fairness, sexual liberation. The social experiment.
well, Wetterstedt was part of that and it was my job to keep him clean.
my job then, your job now. It's what we do.
you think I'm the bad guy?
well, maybe one day, Wallander, your time will come.
and when it does, you'll realise you don't have the choice.
I was nothing.
the janitor, like you.
you wanna make a difference?
join the Fire Brigade.
thanks for your help. - Not at all.
Sandin, anything else you can get on him.
he'll have covered his tracks, but give it a go. - ok.
Kurt. You just missed your daughter, she left this.
didn't know it was your birthday. - It's not.
the profiler has just arrived - Mats Ekholm.
obviously the axe and the scalpings are the elements of the case that stand out so far.
I believe scalpings usually signify...
a trophy or a sacrifice. We've done that.
presumably you've contacted Native American societies and the like?
although some facets of the culture I find quite...
what about the killer?
first impressions, what can you give us?
two killings is not usually sufficient to establish anything like a definitive profile.
how many do you need? I'm sure if we wait long enough...
two things occur immediately.
one, the killings were clearly premeditated, they follow almost identical patterns - executions, almost.
two, the Native American motif.
people who find themselves in a psychic borderland often try to hide behind another person's identity, or - transform themselves into a mythological figure.
your killer appears to have crossed a psychological boundary.
virtually anyone can commit murder or manslaughter without premeditation.
on the surface, he can live a completely normal life.
he has two identities that he controls utterly.
fine.
so now we know that we're looking for someone who seems completely normal on the surface.
very helpful.
thank you, Mats. That was really useful, I'm sure.
does anyone have any questions?
give him a chance.
makes me feel about 108.
nice suit, though.
wait by the car! Wait by the car. - Hurry up!
in you go.
wait there.
good boys!
shall we go and see Daddy?
Yes, you've got Mummy's phone.
sorry I'm so late. - It's fine. I'm glad you could make it.
Hi, Dad. - Hey.
happy birthday.
you're late.
Yeah, I know, I...
well, I haven't missed tea, have I?
got something for you.
what is it?
why don't you open it?
I wasn't asking you.
put it down.
shall we get some tea, then?
here you go.
thank you.
art dealer.
I heard about it on the radio. Axe, good riddance.
so you knew him?
what colour were his brains? The colour of money?
dad, Dad, Dad...
you complain I take no interest in your work.
someone puts an axe through Arne Carlman's skull, finally your work is interesting.
so what did you know about him?
well...
I'm a witness!
he was a shit!
a shyster!
someone re-designs his head? Look no further than a painter.
maybe I'm a suspect!
too hot!
Povel... - Filthy muck burning my mouth!
grandad... - Hot shit burning my mouth!
OK, Dad.
dad? Dad? It's OK.
grandpa?
it's nothing.
he just gets a bit worked up sometimes.
are you sure?
are you OK? - We're fine.
see you soon, OK?
he'll work for a couple of hours now.
goodbye, darling. - Bye, Gertrude.
see you. - Thanks.
Bye.
I told you he was ill.
Gertrude says not.
birthdays!
sorry.
Yes.
...Down at the docks.
axe and scalping, but look at the eyes.
acid. Both eyes burnt out.
eyes - what the hell does that mean?
and where's that profiler?!
come on, I need help.
I can't just come up with solutions to please you.
I need time to work this through. - Haven't got time!
you must have an instinct, something.
OK, well, he's more angry, isn't he?
he wants to hurt this guy, torture him.
the others were all killed with a single blow, so...
...this guy is more special in some way.
more... personal?
maybe.
what about the eyes?
maybe this guy witnessed something.
maybe... Maybe the killer is taking revenge for something to do with his own eyes. God, I don't know.
Yeah, well, you're doing great.
you've got some puke on your jacket, though. - Shit.
Kurt. - Yeah?
there's something you should see.
the tide must be going out.
the van is registered to a Bjorn Fredman.
he was a fence. He's done time.
fencing what kind of stuff?
it doesn't specify.
he was also arrested for battery.
Yeah, I know him, if it's the same one.
well.
Yeah. He's low-life.
last time I heard of him, he'd laid into his wife, beat her up when she was pregnant.
last address we have is in Tomelilla.
when did you last see your husband?
weeks ago.
we try not to have anything to do with him.
and you have other children, I believe.
Louise, my daughter.
she's away at the moment.
is she?
jens is still asleep.
he wakes up.
shall I?
I'll do it.
you can ask me stuff.
the last time Dad was here, he picked a fight with a taxi driver outside.
ended up hitting the guy with a monkey wrench.
the time before that, it was a neighbour's mother.
so he had enemies, then.
anyone got a problem with him, he'd just hit them.
did he hit you?
it was better when he left.
I suppose I should feel sad, shouldn't I?
I don't know.
how do you feel?
I'm not sure yet.
you got a dad?
you mean is he still around? Yeah.
what's he like?
how long have you got?
what does he do?
he's a painter.
what, like a builder and decorator?
no. Like an artist.
an artist, wow.
why did you wanna be a policeman, then?
my dad's been asking himself that question for 25 years.
I couldn't paint, I suppose.
got him down again.
do you want some coffee?
Thanks. There's just a few more things that we have to ask, and then I'll leave you alone.
I'll get it.
do you think I'm in shock?
not being sad, do you... do you think that's shock?
well, when all's said and done, he was your dad.
doesn't always cut it, though, does it?
Yep. - Erika Carlman's tried to top herself.
Christ.
definite suicide attempt, she's in a coma.
I don't think it's the first time she's tried.
I saw cuts on her wrist when she hit me.
she hit you?
her father's death was...
was she very close to him?
what do you mean?
well, did they get on?
I can't see what that's got to do with you, Inspector.
in fact, I'm not quite sure what you're doing here.
if you don't mind, I'd like to sit with my daughter. - Of course.
see you back at the station.
yeah?
Oh, God, no.
I thought I'd pay you a visit at work.
they said that you got into a fight?
at the supermarket?
it's going.
it's eating into me.
dementia, senility...
Alzheimer's! Whatever they call it now.
you mean...
have you seen someone?
have you been diagnosed?
when?
does it matter?
what do you mean, does it matter? Why didn't you say something?
Why? - Why?! What did you think?
did you think that you would martyr yourself to it?
that you could beat it? Christ!
how long have you got?
months! I don't know!
what about... What about Gertrude, does she know?
I told her not to say anything. - You bloody tyrant!
you bloody old tyrant!
I'm so sorry, Dad.
I don't know what to do. What can I do?
nothing. - Well, there must be something.
do you want to solve it?
well, you can't! It is what it is!
so, who did I hit?
I don't know what I'm saying, exactly.
But?
painting, something sexual, yeah?
abuse? - I don't know.
but the mother got really spiky when I asked about Erika and her father.
Fredman has a daughter, strangely absent... - Wetterstedt?
young girls. - Prostitutes. It's not the same.
similar taste in art. - There's no connection to Fredman.
apart from the killer.
all the prints from each case are the same. He leaves them everywhere.
are you absolutely sure it's a he?
I can't see a woman landing those blows.
even an abused woman?
there's something essentially male about the killings, their conception, their execution.
well, is there a chance he's done now?
my instinct tells me not.
Oh. Nyberg.
can you come and have a look at this?
what? - It's a report from the lab.
your father's ill, isn't he?
I saw him when they brought him in.
the raging, the confusion...
not much we can do.
can't solve Alzheimer's.
Christ, I'm beginning to sound like him now.
I just...should have seen it.
there were enough signs.
it's not your fault. - I don't need bloody analysing, OK?
this is not for me to say... - Don't say it, then.
you seem to be... in crisis at the moment.
you recently split with your wife, you have a difficult relationship with your daughter, and now your father has Alzheimer's. You're not getting...
hang on, how the hell do you know that about my wife, my daughter?
the guys. I hear them talking. They're concerned for you.
well, it's none of their business.
it's no-one's business. Christ, I don't know.
I keep thinking I could get out, get a smallholding somewhere, you know, carrots...
carrots? - You know, produce.
pigs, maybe. A couple of pigs.
tell me about your wife.
it's a trial separation.
if one of us meets someone, we'll do the divorce, that's the deal.
she's seeing somebody.
and you didn't think she would?
you should go home.
I can't. - There's nothing more you can do tonight.
Where's your daughter?
waiting.
OK, Liljegren.
and what did he do? - Playboy. Financial scams.
shell companies, money laundering...
so now we've got a former Minister of Justice, an art dealer and a white-collar crook.
and a wife-beating thug.
I need you to get your mum up. I know it's early. I'm sorry.
has there been another one?
Yeah. It's important, I'm afraid. - OK.
that's such a mess!
there's a cloth in the kitchen. I'll get Mum up. - Thanks.
is that your sister? - Yeah.
Louise, yeah?
and she's away? - Yeah, she went off.
often does, you know? Mates.
well, what's to stay for?
she doesn't work?
no.
Oh, how's your old man?
my dad? - Yeah. The artist.
he's fine, thanks. He's...
actually, he's not well.
so...
...he's not fine, then?
old age thing.
look...
I really need to ask your mum some questions about your dad.
what about him?
it would probably be better if I talked to her. It's about his business.
she never had anything to do with his business.
too scared of him.
OK. What about your sister? Was she scared of him?
Well...Why do you keep asking stuff about my sister?
I have to ask stuff about everything. What about your brother, Jens?
well...
jens used to run out of the room whenever Dad came round.
he hit him when he was a baby.
he hit him?
Yeah. And he cried.
did he ever touch your sister? - What, hit her, you mean?
hit her or... touch her in any other way?
well...
these questions are weird. Um...
how should I know stuff like that?
no, I'm sorry.
you don't know where she is? You don't know when she'll be back?
I told you.
OK. I'm going to need...
...a picture of her. Can I take that one?
I've got a better one in my room.
OK. Can I use the bathroom? - Yeah. It's down on your right.
there you go.
nice smile.
he wasn't around.
Hi.
he fell over, banged his head.
Ah, little fella, you been in the wars?
come on, Jens, it's OK. Shh, shh. Come on, sweetie.
it's OK, Mum, I'll take him. - Thanks.- Come on.
I'm sorry. - It's OK. Stefan's been great.
the pills belong to Louise Fredman.
see if you can find the doctor. I'm sure that's some kind of serious anti-depressant.
Kurt, I've got some background
maybe it's nothing, but a couple of the uniform guys reckon he used to have these major league parties at his villa - all-nighters.
they used to ship girls in. - Prostitutes?
I suppose so. - Great. Thank you.
see if we can get someone from one of those parties.
one of the women, yeah? - All right.
Kurt! Erika Carlman has regained consciousness.
it started when I was a child...
with him coming into my bedroom.
it's OK.
I was so frightened.
I had to look at that horrible painting every day.
what was in his head.
but I still loved him.
how could I still love him?
what's wrong with me?
there's nothing wrong with you.
he was your father.
there's nothing wrong with you at all.
is someone...
...taking revenge for these girls?
Hello?
it's Svedberg. He's found a prostitute from the Liljegren parties. - OK.
I think there's a market for virgins.
there usually is with these guys.
feeds into some fantasy about them screwing their daughters.
look, I just need some names, OK?
there were no names.
well, did you recognise any of the faces, then?
not my world.
Thanks.
you see this man?
Gustav Wetterstedt.
a couple of times.
what about him? What about him?
keep me out of this, please.
I have a young daughter. I was told you just wanted help.
Yeah, it's OK, it's OK. I'll look after you, I promise.
but I have to know, did you see this man?
some sort of courier.
brought the girls in from wherever.
I saw him hanging around.
but not in the parties.
um, just one more.
um, you see her?
I don't think so. - You don't think so?!
maybe. There were so many different girls.
a lot of them were foreign.
I never asked questions. - One more girl.
short, dark skinned. How old's your daughter?
13. - Right, well, this one was 15 years old and she wore this round her neck.
she burnt herself to death in front of me because she was so bloody scared and I think that you know what she was so scared of.
there was another man.
he was like the agent.
he was evil.
evil.
would you recognise him again if you saw him?
I will look after you, I promise.
I don't know.
Louise Fredman's doctor has got back to us.
she's been in the psychiatric unit at Lund Hospital Clinic for the last six months.
can I talk to her?- No one can.
in a state of prolonged trauma. Hasn't spoken since she was admitted.
she was found wandering half-naked in a park, apparently. Complete breakdown.
why did you lie?
she can't help you.
she can't help anyone. - Her father's been murdered.
good, good. I'm glad that he's dead.
are you gonna arrest me now?
she doesn't speak, she doesn't listen.
Ow! Jens, stop it!
the doctor said that she's willing herself to die. - Do you want Mum?
get off me! - Mum. Mum?
OK.
I know about your sister. Why didn't you tell me?
please, darling. Jens, shh.
what happened to his eyes?
I thought he hurt his head.
I think you should leave us.
right, look, please, Jens.
yeah?
Kurt, we've got some information on Fredman coming through that I think you should see.
Fredman was arrested seven years ago for assault, and the charges were dropped.
by Sandin.
that's the connection.
this was taken a few years ago.
obviously, he'd be older now.
is this the man you saw at the parties?
you need to do this properly.
Kurt! You can't go there on your own.
Sandin's gone.
we're too late.
Hello?
police!
please help.
it's all right. It's all right, I'm...
try not to worry.
drink the water. You're safe now.
police.
that's it, try to keep warm.
he was police.
but a murderer?
don't worry. - Do you understand?
the boy with the eyes.
bad bruising and cuts around his eyes.
his mother said he'd been stabbing himself with a fork.
the injuries were consistent with that, like he was trying to put his own eyes out.
I submitted the details to social services.
Oi! - Where is he?
what are you doing?
her diary.
it's all in here.
Fredman - her own father, for God's sake - pimped her out to Wetterstedt.
sandin organised it like he organised Liljegren's parties -the girls from abroad.
girls like Dolores.
virgins.
the eyes? - Revenge for the little brother.
how could a kid of 15 do all this?
he's no ordinary kid.
he's a warrior. - What's he gonna do next?
Sandin.
you can't do that. I'm your prisoner.
I'm in your custody. You're responsible for me, Wallander.
you were police.
a 15-year-old girl burnt herself to death in front of me because I told her I was police.
she thought I was like you.
that maniac puts an axe through my skull, by God, you'll pay.
I'm willing to take that risk.
go.
side window.
it's all right. It's me.
lower your guns, lower your guns.
lower your guns, lower your guns.
it's all right, Stefan. Give me the axe.
Oh, God, please.
I have to free her soul.
I have to punish them.
they'll be punished.
please.
give me the axe.
what would you do?
you think this man's life is worth more than mine?
more than my sister's?
no-one deserves to die, Stefan.
no-one.
Yes, they do.
Stefan...
...stay still.
he's OK.
got to go.
got to go and see Grandad.
is he all right? - Hi. Um...
dad...
I can't do it any more, Dad.
I can't do it.
any of it.
when you were a boy, you used to ask me...
...about my work...
the painting.
why are they always the same, Dad?
why don't you do something different?
I could never explain. You see...
each morning, when I start,
I think I'll do something else.
this morning, I'll paint a seascape.
this morning I'll do a still life, "maybe an abstract, just splash on the paint, see where it takes me."
and then I start, and every time, I paint the same thing.
the landscape.
whatever I do, this is what comes out.
what you've got is your painting.
you know what I'd like before I lose what's left of my mind?
I'd like to go to Rome.
I'd like that.
look at the paintings, other people's paintings.
can we do that?
Yeah.
Yes, Dad...
we can do that.
drink fast. First one's free.
why is that?
drunks spend a lot of money.
good business plan.
that's how we make the rent.
Eddie around?
he's washing up.
come again?
he can't keep his hands off of me.
I'm in the wrong line of work.
I'm not hiring, lieutenant.
how you doin', kid?
10 years on the job, still aboveground.
Oh, you're moonlighting?
worse than that. I own this place. Hey, asshole!
use an ashtray!
off your meds?
a little bit.
what, uh, what'd they suspend you for?
I killed a fugitive i was chasing.
accident?
that's my story.
guy hopped a fence at a federal prison in virginia, i hunted him for 3 days, i cornered him, i gave him a chance. He starts running and shooting at me.
and what happened?
my warning shot hit him in the face.
what are you doing here?
I called the district office. I got permission to offer you a job.
I got a job.
u. s. Marshals service doesn't want you back for a while, eddie. And we both know, left to your own devices only bad things can happen.
now, that hurts.
what's the gig?
same thing you're good at... fugitive and suspect investigation and apprehension.
where?
l. a. County.
you in charge?
completely.
there's a deal-breaker.
what do you mean?
you were a dick to me when i was a trainee.
I was your training officer, not your mother.
I had to get through to you.
you are the main reason that i joined the marshals instead of metro pd, which means you had a hand in me getting all backed up with this bad shooting.
you're blaming me for you killing a suspect?
if you had been nicer to me, who knows?
forget it. I just remembered what i hate about you.
I'll do it.
forget it, eddie!
Ah, yah, yah. I was just waxing your hood. I'm in.
you lead, i'll follow.
why are you hiring?
one of my guys went down in the line last week.
on your watch?
Yeah.
I'm gonna need hazard pay, bro.
Eddie, sometimes you're funny. And then there's now.
Yeah, well...
thanks for the job.
you're welcome.
and thanks...
for forgiving me, you know, and for what it's worth, i did not see it coming.
see what coming?
sleeping with lucinda after you moved out.
you didn't know?
I gotta be careful what i wish for.
my son is not a bully.
I'm not saying that he is. Tony is a very sweet boy and a good student, but he did instigate a fight yesterday for no reason.
you're assuming that there's no reason.
Mr. Rose, he walked up to another boy and hit him in the jaw.
Why?
pardon me?
the kid must have done something.
this is not a debate.
no. It's about being fair.
the boy was just standing there.
I want to talk to the kid.
that's not possible.
what's right is right.
please pardon my ex-husband, ms. Rule.
he's a cop.
don't say it like a swear word.
he's very good at what he does, and in his experience there are always 2 sides to the story.
ms. Rule: School policy calls for a 3-day suspension.
please don't do that.
if he believes he had a good reason and he's punished for it, it'll confuse him. Let me talk to him first.
glad to see you're getting a handle on your anger issues.
I don't have anger issues.
no, that's right. You just share them with everyone else.
Lucinda, tony didn't belt that kid for no reason.
you're the reason. What do you think it's like being the son of an alpha male cop? He's just trying to measure up and you gotta talk to him about it.
whoa, whoa, whoa there, pumpkin. You're straying into enemy territory.
what are you talking about?
I'm trying to raise a boy into a man here, and hand-wringing, second-guessing, and warm milk aren't gonna help get him there.
hmm. Maybe steroids and a shotgun for christmas?
I'll come by after school and i'll talk to him.
maybe slap him around a little bit?
don't be an ass.
you really sleep with eddie drake after i moved out?
Yes, i did.
was it good? Were you, uh, were you hard up? What?
it was a cry for help.
too bad no one heard you.
man: Get down there! Get on the floor!
recoil spring.
what?
recoil spring's upside down. You flip it over, cross home plate.
Thanks.
no sweat.
you tell anybody about this and i will have to kill you.
we're all here to do what each one of us does best.
don't worry.
range firing isn't a damn bit like shooting someone, is it?
no.
what about the whole "thou shalt not kill" thing?
day comes i'm lucky enough to get there...
I hope he understands.
Hey, how you doin'?
hold up. Who the hell are you?
Eddie drake, u. s.
marshals service.
what are you doin' here?
ladies' night. 2 for 1
well drinks. What about you, froot loop?
let's see your badge.
if we're gonna get along, you're gonna have to change your tone.
Conrad hired you?
Yeah, to replace a guy who went down.
Hey.
that's tommy rodriguez, fbi. Bunks are upstairs.
Rodney gronbeck, lapd.
nice ink. Who's the naked broad?
the love of my life.
lucky man.
she married my brother.
drives him nuts.
bet it feels good, though, huh?
every damn day.
so what happened to the guy who got killed?
the guy had a name.
Yeah, i wouldn't know.
Tommy got tied up with a suspect, the guy had a gun, he starts wild firing...
Joe caught a stray and died where he fell.
any procedural breakdown?
procedural breakdowns?
who is this guy?
what are you trying to say?
you know, viagra and police work don't mix, hard on.
all i'm saying is, my ass depends on you, your ass depends on me. We all have different training and we gotta work that out if we want to make it back alive to these plush surroundings.
you're not exactly batting 1, 000
anymore, huh?
who's the waitress?
your lips, my ass.
man, with accent: Everybody up and go to the window now! Go on!
go on! Get up! To the window!
I don't care. We're not going to phoenix to get this guy. Let the arizona criminal investigation bureau handle it.
Connie, those guys couldn't find tits in a whorehouse.
Yeah, this hurts, but i think tommy's right. I mean, we have his ex-wife's address, the plates on his truck.
we got 95 other suspects in our own zip code.
but this mcqueen's hot right now. With a precise stop and drop, we got him.
I'm with the lieutenant.
we spread our resources too thin and we lose our advantage.
what, did you bring the teacher an apple today?
look, tommy, i know you and the fbi have been hunting mcqueen for months, but i take this team across state lines, belichek and the d. a.'s office are gonna have our badges and our pensions.
so use me.
what?
I'm a u. s. Marshal. I can cross any state line for any reason. I have no jurisdictional restrictions. We don't need to let anybody get away with anything.
that's what i'm talkin'
about.
when you guys start agreeing with him, i'm screwed.
what the hell is that?
nice entrance, boss.
well, sorry about that.
we have a bloodbath in the making at a bank in hollywood.
several hostages and one confirmed death on the street already. We got the call a half hour ago. A woman, a passerby, was shot through the front window.
shots were heard from inside.
first officers on the scene were met with armor-piercing rounds.
they didn't have a chance.
these guys have no intention of giving up.
where are they now?
they're gone.
well, they didn't black out the cameras or try to shoot 'em.
they weren't afraid of being photographed.
it's hollywood, man.
so who are you guys, exactly?
undercover fugitive unit.
is that local, federal, state?
all of the above.
so why did they call you in?
we don't have to knock before entering. What's the caliber?
223. teflon coated.
cop killers.
Hey, feel free to corrupt any more of the crime scene, bro. Some more fingerprints over there you could smudge.
these guys don't care if we know who they are. If they did, they wouldn't have blown the crap out of everything in in broad daylight... bro.
what?
blew this guy's face off.
if you wanted to kill him for mouthing off, you'd pop him once. This guy took a full mag.
And?
were you in the dumb-ass question of the week club in school? They weren't in a hurry.
take the time if you need to, if there's a reason.
now you know why i called you in.
Oh, yeah.
TV reporter: Officer! Officer, hayden adams, channel 13.
is that one of the murder weapons? Do you know what started the shooting? How many people were killed?
you want to come behind the crime scene tape with me?
sure.
there are big chunks of skull in there, pools of blood, and gray matt... you know what gray matter is? It's brain tissue. Looks like cheese curd.
one of the guys in there got his face blown off. Hey, we could get a close-up. It'll look awesome on camera. The i'll take you over there to that dead baby in the stroller so you can postulate to the public as to the suffering the poor kid must have endured. And you'll love delivering the death notifications to the wives and children of the officers who died. Get some prize footage of them bawling. What do you say?
you up for it? Piece of shit.
man, you gotta dial down the voices in your head.
my demons won't settle for a tie.
is that an m-4, jimmy?
sort of.
it's an m-4, jimmy.
Tommy, if the gun had tits and panties, i might listen to you. It started off as a seml-automatic and then was illegally converted to a fully automatic, probably using a mail order upper receiver barrel parts kid.
serial number's been filed, but i can acid test it. Maybe i can something to track.
Amen.
how does that work?
the pressure of the stamp that imprinted the serial number into the receiver causes a slight compression into the metal below the numbers themselves. The acid will bring it out. And after that...
sub-atomic shit. I don't know.
sheriff's homicide and and lapd violent crimes are going house to house in the immediate area.
these guys are running.
we know that.
anyone they meet is dead.
we are locking the city down.
if they get cornered, they're gonna keep killing.
that's why we are evacuating all local schools and covering the airports and the train and bus stations. The key is to keep the public from panicking. If they see us overreact, they sleep better.
if i know your team is working the case, i sleep better. You'll close this by the end of business, right?
sure. And santa reads every letter.
this is messed up.
watch. Here it comes.
according to the time-coding on the tapes, they sat outside for a half an hour before they ever went inside the bank.
they were waiting for it to open up.
no, they weren't.
back it up.
OK, run it. Stop.
there. Him.
what about him?
it's the guy they overkilled.
so? What does that mean?
I don't know.
you got a name?
that's a nice irish name.
all right, here's the tape from the inside.
I got a partial number.
no match, though. The thing is, there's only a couple of shops that sell that kind of gun.
you and drake.
gun store owner: All of my sales are legal.
so you're saying you sold this weapon before it was converted.
I'm saying all my sales are legal.
sir, lower your voice.
owner: I am not yelling!
you are.
ATF records show 8 legal sales of this type of weapon from this shop within the last 2 months. 7 background checks cleared, the eighth hasn't, which means the weapon should still be here. You show it to us, we leave.
owner: You need a warrant for me to show you my sales rec...
I didn't ask to see your records, you idiot! What the hell's the matter with you?
owner: You need a warrant!
no, i don't. I'm atf, which means i do whatever i damn well please. I was trying to be polite, asshole.
Myron, do you have a bathroom?
Myron: What?
all this yelling...
my bladder... i gotta pee.
Myron: Yeah, it's in the back.
open up the cabinet, show me the weapon, i walk out of here. Stop being such a prick.
Myron: You know me for 6 years, you come with no warrant...
stop being such a prick!
Myron: I'm not the prick! You're the prick! I'm just doin' my job here.
Oh, myron. Uhh...
it's a gusher.
Myron: Aah!
go.
colt commando...
model number m16-a2-428.
it's a gusher.
I got no movement inside.
this is the right building, right, chief?
this is the building, tommy. This is the building address of the credit card used to buy the weapon. Connie?
me and drake are at the back door near the 1-2 corner.
you notify lapd we're here?
I don't want any friendly fire.
Yes, sir, they know.
we're at the 4-1 corner near the front.
Jimmy, you ready? We're going in.
don't aim.
what?
don't aim when you fire.
just point and pull.
I got no shot. The windows are painted over.
Jimmy, he's coming your way.
I got no shot. I'm comin'
in.
great.
don't do it! Drop it!
now! Drop your weapon now!
drop your weapon!
Aah!
don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do...
what are you doing?
proving my point.
it's slobadovich. The guy they executed at the bank.
pager. There's no number.
what do we do?
this wasn't a bank robbery. It was an assassination. The old man was a witness.
a witness to what?
genocide. Or at least that's what his file says.
what?
naval intelligence, remember? One of milosevic's generals is going on trial for war crimes and slobadovich was gonna testify against him in the hague next month.
well, how does this help us find these guys?
I'm getting there. The dead shooter was slavko petrovic. He lived here and bought all the weapons for the killing team. Rodney?
this was taken at the airport in mcallen, texas, 3 days ago.
freeze it. That's petrovic. He's meeting with the other 2 men.
they passed through customs under the names graber and sitska.
why'd they come through texas?
they're not gonna come in through kennedy just to hit the gift shops.
it's a simple question.
and you're a simple asshole. The bigger problem is i'm pretty sure that petrovic was their out, the guy they were gonna need to leave the country.
they must know he's dead by now, which means they know we're after them. They're gonna have to improvise, which makes them more dangerous.
you're hoping their panic gives them away.
Yes.
how you doing with that callback number?
back it up, new guy.
tracing a cell signal ain't like tracing a land line.
he's gonna stop calling.
patience is a virtue, sayeth the lord.
the lord didn't know about these assholes when he said that.
lieutenant. Slobadovich has a daughter, in tarzana.
Connie, there's 2 doas.
her kid, female, about 14, and a male, white, 40s, probably her husband.
don't touch anything.
save it for the lapd homicide and the m. e.
they didn't have a chance.
I'm thinking about learning french.
what?
I'm thinking about learning french. You speak a foreign language?
speak in tongues when the lord switches me on.
no shit. So you bought the whole heaven and hell thing on spec?
that's right.
there was adam and eve and the two nippers, right?
Yeah.
Where'd the wives come from?
I don't know and it doesn't matter.
you still believe?
I kind of have to.
yeah? Why?
not right now.
so what's it like, speaking in tongues?
it's kind of like french, except more consonants.
huh.
but forget about the whole french thing, though.
Why?
well, i don't think it'll take. See, french is a romance language, and you're an asshole.
you're probably right.
I'm just trying to shake it off.
Yeah. Me, too.
Jimmy, knocking: Connie?
Yeah, jimmy, what's up?
I was just, uh, putting together some of joe vacco's things.
OK.
we ever gonna talk about it?
talk about it?
you mean me and you hittin' our knees genuflecting and weeping together?
you don't need to get bent, sir.
I don't? Really? You come in here insinuating i'm some kind of asshole for avoiding a warm and cozy over the death of a fellow officer?
I'm not insinuating a damn thing. If you're not in the mood, you're not in the mood.
all right, sit down.
he was a pain in the ass.
that's true.
I mean... his politics...
if attila was running for president, he'd caste the first vote.
he blasphemed as a form of entertainment.
and did you ever have to endure a toilet that he had just used?
there wasn't enough gasoline in texas to get rid of that smell.
Oh... oh, shit.
I miss him.
Yeah, me, too.
you good?
I'm good.
all right.
what's up, kiddo?
Tony: Well, i was just calling 'cause, um, i know you're mad and you're probably gonna give it to me, so i just wanted to get it over with.
kid, i'm not gonna do anything until i know what happened, till i hear it from you.
Tony: Well, ms. Rule suspended me.
What?!
Tony: She said she was waiting to hear from you, but she couldn't wait, so she kicked me out of school for 3 days.
that's not what she and l... all right, look, uh, i'm gonna call her.
Tony: No, no, that's ok.
I did what i did. I just wanted you to know.
Tony, why did you hit that kid?
Tony: I was defending myself.
but she said that you started it.
Tony: I was just doing what you always told me to do.
I was sticking up for myself.
the handsome guy's onto something.
but i didn't tell you to start fights.
I thought that's what you'd say.
so... whatever. I gotta go.
hold up. Don't you dare hang up, and don't you ever...
say "whatever" to me.
I'm coming over tonight, you're gonna look me in the eye, you're gonna tell me your side, and i'm gonna believe you. All right?
Tony: Ok, pop.
what's up?
my grandmother isabel.
Yeah, she's lovely.
what the hell are you talking about?
last month my grandma goes to visit my mom in el paso.
airline loses her luggage, she's going on and on about "my rosary, my shoes, my nightie, my pictures of bobo.
her dog.
she's full latina and the best she can come up with is You givin' my grandmother shit about her dog?
Yeah. It's a stupid name.
own it.
you and me are gonna talk, man.
pack a lunch, clown.
read me the ending, Rodney, the tape.
it was bugging me, that office the guy walked into, so i called the tsa in mcallen. That's carousel 4, terminal 1. where our guy went is the eastern atlantic lost luggage office.
lance graber, one bag, found yesterday, still not returned.
I told them not to contact him.
said we would.
that's the number calling the dead guy's pager.
Hey.
don't let him get to you.
yeah? How do i avoid that? He's been on my ass jabbin' me ever since he pulled in.
we're short-handed.
the guy's got balls for miles.
you just deal.
Connie should've told us.
run it by us? We work off of a lead, follow, or get the hell out of the way philosophy. We don't have time for professional foreplay.
well, i guess i don't like the way connie runs things.
before i signed on, i was undercover on my own. I didn't have to worry about punching a clock or saying the word "sir.
sounds like you got bigger problems than drake.
what, you think?
listen, take some time off. Go fishing. Get some sleep.
or get laid? I couldn't do that to you, man.
what do you mean?
well, you'd miss me too much. Do not break my heart.
we take him alive, we get an "attaboy" from the d. a.
Yeah, i'm sure they're gonna assume the felony prone position when i pull out my shiny, scary badge.
I said "if.
Yeah.
I've been thinking about it, and in the interests of our friendship, i'm pretty sure you gotta beat the shit out of me.
Why?
for what i did wrong.
you're gonna have to be I'm talking about me and lucinda.
my buddy here saw fit to engage in sexual congress with my wife right after my marriage failed. Isn't that christmassy?
did you sleep with her before or after the divorce?
before. I'd just moved out.
that's bad, right?
off the charts, drake.
that's why i need a beating.
so you can feel better?
Yeah.
no. And not because i don't want you to suffer, but because i honestly don't give a crap.
how can you not give a crap?
marriage is like hockey.
it's a full-contact sport with a time limit. But what i don't get is you didn't feel bad until you told me about it. It's like swaggart weeping about the whores only after he got caught.
it means nothing.
I was drunk!
was she?
Oh, yeah.
I'm getting into the back of the fan now.
Rodney, you sure this is the right address?
Tommy, take the 1-2 corner.
Jimmy, you got the 3-4. me and merced are hanging back in case somebody runs.
vengeance is mine, sayeth the lord.
Hello?
Hello? Eastern atlantic
Hello!
Trey jenkins, eastern atlantic luggage! Hello!
whoa. Brother, uh, i'm just dropping off somebody's luggage here.
put it down.
what are you doing with that gun?
who are you?
I'm just a guy who's, uh, trying to drop off a bag and get out of here as fast as i can.
Hey, you all right?
Conrad, voice distorted: Can you hear me? Are you hit?
no, ok. I'm ok.
that's not gonna happen!
what's he saying?
I have no idea.
we all want to get out of here alive! Put down the gun.
give me a corner shot.
let her go! Let her go!
put the gun down!
take your finger off the trigger!
walk away! Walk away!
let her go!
we all want to walk out of here alive. Just calm down.
take your finger off the trigger.
put the gun down!
I got no shot.
Connie, he's gonna kill her.
what?
the third guy.
quiet!
ma'am. Please.
lady, you're alive. Shut up!
Rodney, the number.
Tommy, fbi got anything yet?
no, sir. Graber hasn't shown up at any border crossings, airports, or train stations.
LAPD, the sheriffs, and chp have all the team's 8x10s.
Merced, is there any chance that he'd show up on the intelligence grid?
not unless he uses his passport or return tickets, and that's not gonna happen.
all right, so he got away. Rodney, put him on a list.
Yes, sir.
you took the last beer.
don't worry. I know where you can get more.
Tony: You scare me a little, dad.
that's exactly what i'm trying not to do.
room looks good.
still an angels fan?
Tony: Kind of.
I like the dodgers better, though.
why don't you have a dodger pennant up?
Tony: Well, you told me i had to be an angels fan.
I did? When?
Tony: When i was little.
so what happened, kiddo?
Oh, i don't know. I was scared.
scared of what?
Tony: The guy i hit, billy Why?
since school started this year, he's been on my back.
knocking the books out of my hands, tripping me, spitting in my lunch. And the other day after school he said he's gonna kick my ass.
why didn't you call me?
Oh...
Tony: So at the break i pass him in the halls and he's all, like, "oh, yeah, you're gonna take a beatin'" and everything, and...
I don't know what happened.
I just started hitting him as hard as i could.
a bunch of times.
I guess i was sick of being scared.
right, left, right?
Tony: Yeah. Just like you taught me.
you did the right thing.
Tony: I did?
no one has the right to make you feel scared. And you have every right to defend yourself, even if that means taking the first punch.
bet the little sucker was happy you got suspended.
Yeah.
next time...
next time something like this happens, give me a heads-up.
maybe we can fix it before it gets broken. You know what i mean?
OK, pop.
do you have any idea how much i love you?
if you say yes, you don't.
good night, son.
Tony: Good night, pop.
I don't know.
sometimes i forget why i wanted a divorce.
it'll come to you.
you did good.
thank you.
so this is your place, huh?
Yep.
that means these beers are free, right?
Nope.
come on, man, it's the least you can do for being such a dick.
forget him. Listen, i just wanted to, uh...
you know... it's good working with you. Welcome.
thank you. Thank you, guys.
he said it, i didn't.
my lips didn't move.
all right, slow down...
hello.
Hello?
hello.
Hello?
man down! Man down!
...and alameda. Code 3.
shots fired! Shots fired!
target eastbound, Sanborn.
to the backyard. I'm behind him.
he went into 9.
Drake, where are you?
who the hell knows?
Silverlake's laid out like a whore's armpit.
Hey, you guys see a guy with long hair come through here?
I'm out front.
Conrad: You see him?
no.
Conrad: Take a covering position. I'm inside the yard.
damn it. Arneson got away again.
how does he do it?
the D. A.'s gonna freak out.
too smart. Too damn fast.
we better call it in. Tell 'em he got away.
Yeah.
lieutenant Conrad Rose, L. A. Metro.
nice to see you again... for the last time.
another birthday party? Whose is it?
nobody's.
it's Ella's.
Ella? Have i met her?
no.
so what? You like this girl?
no.
come on, what's the big deal?
there's no big deal.
I just don't wanna talk about it.
come on.
what about you, pop?
it's been 6 months since you and mom split up.
I mean this in the best way.
shut up.
Hey, how was practice?
great.
you're late. Their dinner's getting cold.
pizza's great cold.
I'll have you know I made macaroni and cheese...
from scratch.
you're watching cooking shows again.
Hey, pop. That's your favorite.
can you stay for dinner?
that's up to your mom.
please, mom?
you're doing the dishes.
nothing sexier than a woman drinking beer out of a bottle.
well, I do what I can.
Millie's asleep.
thank god.
she's been fighting to stay up later and later.
full-blown tantrums. Drive me crazy.
she didn't get it from me.
I know.
did you know our son has a girlfriend?
Mm-hmm. Ella.
he's been in love with her since the second grade.
where have you been?
not apparently where he is.
so, you're not...
you know, dating?
no. Nah. Feels weird.
Mm.
you know what's weirder?
what?
this.
I'm too mad at you to pull the trigger here.
shut up.
damn you.
van's here.
SHERIFF: Stand up.
turn to your left.
let's go.
Spurrier: Case number 25c.
see you at trial.
no kiss?
SHERIFF: Shut up, settle down!
female officer: Garcia, i don't want to hear a word from you.
you! You!
gronbeck, when she's not munching testicles, your wet dream's kinda cute.
wouldn't let her hear you say that.
women hate cute.
you like her too much.
you know, she can smell that fear.
ladies like guys who don't give a shit.
it's nature. Biology.
goes back to the neolithic period.
you look like you could bite the heads off bats, which is cool, but when you get around her, you're all jell-o.
and that's bad.
Gronbeck: What do you mean?
Merced: Women like power, period.
hunters, not gatherers. Bring home the kill, make a fire, feed the family.
it's all about confidence, self-possession, sex without asking first.
I'd let you all bask in the glory of busting number 28, arneson, but that would keep us from the task at hand.
Rodney, punch up case file number 592308-2.
pull up number 51.
Jin-Lee park, aka j. p. leader of the k-town warriors.
Jin-Lee and 2 other k-town warriors had been held in central jail for the past 8 months pending rape and felony homicide charges.
these crimes were committed during home invasions, which is how they finance the gang.
they escaped yesterday being transported from the courthouse back to central jail.
and in the process, 2 guards were killed execution-style.
it was well-planned. Outside guys knew the exact route the van was taking, and they hit it with a stolen city trash truck.
they hijacked a city truck?
Yes.
had to be an inside guy in the courthouse.
you got an idea? Pitch it.
I say we pull all the guards and clerks in a room, get creative, and see who wets their diaper first.
that sounds like fun. You and I will take that.
gronbeck, Merced, check out known associates, including gang sluts and bar owners.
look under every rock, down every toilet.
with all due respect, sir, this is a closed community.
the koreans are segregated.
most of them don't trust authority.
especially... no offense... white cops.
I'm not white.
rodriguez: Oh, yes, you are.
DRAKE: I am?
Yeah. Me, too.
damn it.
they'll close ranks big-time.
and with the warriors back on the street, even the ones who wanna talk won't in fear of retribution.
that's interesting. You learn this in naval intelligence?
Yes, sir, I did. I actually speak a fair amount of korean.
Conrad: Good. Good.
well, that'll come in handy when you check out known associates, including the aforementioned gang sluts and bar owners, like i ordered.
Jimmy, tell miss manners why we go into a community that hates our guts looking for info.
Mcgloin: The best way to induce panic into somebody that we're chasing is for them to feel us on the street.
they sleep less, run faster.
fatigue causes bad judgment, and they make mistakes.
if the warriors are hiding in some spider hole and they feel trapped, they're gonna run.
Rodriguez, Jimmy, get lists of the family members of these guys.
aunts, uncles, grannies, second cousins...
anyone that won't look you in the eye, you bring him in.
put hoods on 'em. Don't tell 'em where they're going.
I want the shit scared out of them.
you serious? You want me and Mcgloin to round up blue hairs with AARP cards?
this isn't a democracy. I tell you to do something, do it.
well, what do we charge 'em with?
murder, mayhem, and pissing me off.
Ugh.
every pore of my body reeks of smoke.
doesn't anybody in koreatown obey the no-smoking laws?
[Speaking korean]
it's wonderful, isn't it?
smoking in a non-smoking zone.
one of the last bastions of peaceful resistance.
literally blowing smoke in the face of government tyranny over freedom of choice.
you're a smoker.
Yes, ma'am.
explains why you run out of breath every time you zip up your pants.
l. A. Fugitive task force.
which one of you is paul shin?
you're the police?
we're looking for these guys.
have any of them been in contact with you?
I'll have to find it first.
Merced: Look at these photos.
Gronbeck: Come on. You and Jin-Lee go way back.
you remember.
you run whores.
he steal the cash to pay for them.
it's the enron business model.
is there a reward?
you tell me, you find him and convict him, the city of los angeles will give you $25, 000.
we don't know them.
change your mind...
we're not here to pursue an investigation at this point.
this is about your safety.
Conrad: We intercepted a cell phone conversation last night between one of the escaped convicts and another gang member.
they were talking about killing their "inside guy."
torturing and killing their inside guy.
Conrad: We believe they're referring to whoever gave them the route back to central jail.
one of you.
these guys have no loyalties outside their gang, and they are known for their brutality.
the last victim took, what, how many hours to bleed out?
couple, give or take. [Cell phone rings]
Hey, captain.
Valenza: Jin-Lee's crew hit another house in Brea.
if you were involved or suspect one of your co-workers of being involved, you better step to the front of the line now for your own protection and that of your families.
thanks for your time. We gotta roll.
rodriguez: Belichek's gonna have our asses when she finds out what we're doing.
taking civilians into custody with bullshit charges.
Mcgloin: Will you stop whining?
rodriguez: Fine. Tell me what we're gonna charge grandma and grandpa with.
spitting, not cleaning up after the dog, using msg in that kung pao. Who cares?
Kung pao's chinese, not korean.
it's the same thing.
right. And the british are the same as the irish.
hey... shut your mouth.
all i'm saying is if you're gonna be racist, be accurate.
nothing.
I didn't ask.
it's just my sister down in redondo.
she's calling about dinner.
what is she, a dentist?
no, she works at target in manhattan beach.
and ever since my mom died, we try to keep the family together, meet once a week, break bread.
sounds nice.
it can be.
so why the intestinal discomfort?
she always invites my father, and he's not worth a pile of dirt.
rodriguez: Hi. Good afternoon, ma'am.
I'm agent rodriguez. This is special agent mcgloin.
don't any of these people have jobs?
you should have taken the side street, man.
is there a moment of any day when you're not bitching about something?
are you jealous? I'm in touch with my anger.
Hi.
we have a problem.
what? - Who is it?
come on. Come on. Who is it?
tell her hi. - Asshole.
what did you call me?
uh... never that. What's going on?
Tony. He, um... he saw us...
on the lawn.
shit!
he seems ok, but I think one of us should talk to him about it, and considering the position my knees were in, l... i don't think it should be me.
I'll be there when I can.
it was, um... it was great, huh?
uh... we'll see.
everything ok?
Oh, yeah. I'm looking down on creation.
guy was a jeweler downtown. They obviously knew him.
they gutted every room.
caught him when his key hit the lock.
police!
man: Oh, god! God! Help her!
God! God! God!
Oh, god! God! Help her!
God!
clear upstairs.
that victim recognized Jin-Lee from the photographs.
they hit two houses, same street, one after the other.
we can't even count on them being afraid of getting caught.
no. What they're doing makes sense.
pardon me?
they've been in custody for almost a year.
they need cash, and they need the competition to know that they shouldn't be messed with.
we're going to get killed in the news if they find out.
Connie, the whole point of your team is speed and stealth, neither of which are in evidence today.
we'll close this.
you keep saying that, and we keep rolling up on crime scenes.
damn it!
who are they?
Jin-Lee's parents.
you get anything?
a lot of shrugs and "I don't knows.
Eddie and I just came from toluca lake.
warriors hit two homes.
they're enjoying this.
maybe we should tail jin-lee's known associates for the next 24 hours, see if he comes out to play.
we don't have that kind of time.
squeeze the families. I'll take them.
Mr. Park, you know what jin-lee is charged with.
you know how he escaped, that he killed two guards, and he's out there killing still.
and if you and your wife don't help me, you're going to jail.
we've done nothing wrong.
being silent means you're protecting him.
protecting him is a crime.
my son is 12 years old, and I can't imagine him being anything other than a great kid.
I know that I can look in those eyes and always see my boy, no matter how old he gets, no matter what he does.
I don't know where Jin-Lee is.
I don't believe you...
and that's a problem for you.
Connie. We caught a break.
they gave me a thousand, cash.
that's two month's rent and my car payment.
Yeah, the economy's in a real downturn.
what was the deal?
I got the route from the driver and then I had to make a call from a pay phone.
Conrad: You have the number?
I threw it out. I don't want any trace of it.
how civic minded.
do you remember who answered?
a man. He was Chinese, I think.
or korean.
maybe.
you guys are gonna protect me, right, me and my boyfriend?
cause they know where I live.
they're gonna kill me.
I don't feel so good.
relax, lady. We lied. You're not a target.
I'm not? Conrad: No.
but you are under arrest.
what?
you're gonna be charged with second-degree murder for the deaths of the two guards.
Oh, are you gonna puke?
Conrad: Bathroom's around the corner to the left.
jiggle the handle. It sticks.
I'm cross-referencing all calls made from the courthouse pay phone to area codes in koreatown.
Hung-su's. It's a video arcade in koreatown.
Mcgloin: Dinner is in two hours.
you're not gonna make dinner, man.
just call your sister and tell her.
she's got kids.
she doesn't have time for a one-on-one with my father.
what are you, 14? Tell her you're working.
Conrad: You hung-su? - Why?
yes or no. Yeah.
lieutenant rose. L. A. Metro.
we're looking for a patron of yours named jin-lee.
is that your phone?
you want to make a call, use the one in the back.
we know that a call came in here yesterday, and then right after a call was made to a cell phone of a known k-town warrior associate.
EDDIE: You work here yesterday at 5: 00?
anyone but you answer the phone?
apparently, hung-su's having trouble with the concept of cooperation.
Merced: Why are they bowing to the punk?
Gronbeck: Lieutenant, we gotta bogey.
merced thinks he may be a k-town warrior possibly headed your way.
sunglasses, 20's.
Yeah, that's him.
he's headin' right towards us.
he's here. Hold your position in case he bolts.
cops, j. p.! Run! Run!
cops! Go! Go!
go! Go! Go!
I'll get the back!
move! Move!
Conrad: Merced, Gronbeck, cover the east alley exit.
stop right there! Right there!
right there!
let me see some hands!
let me see some hands!
do not fire!
do not fire! Too many civilians!
I got him!
back up! Back up!
sweet jesus! He's gonna kill everybody!
damn it, Connie, I had him.
Eddie, what happened in the alley, it happens again, you're gone.
what the hell are you talkin' about?
you disobeyed my orders in a standoff.
I shouldn't even be giving you a warning.
look, man, I almost had him in my sights.
so what?
DRAKE: I could've taken him down...
without incident.
maybe, maybe not.
the point is it's not your decision to make.
I say back up, you back up!
feel free to stop treating me like a trainee.
you know, i know we got a lot of history, not all of it good, but that means shit when we're on the job.
is the lecture over?
I gotta pee.
look, you're a hell of a cop.
you've got great instincts.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and you're the boss.
I get it!
this is the only way I know how to run a team.
yeah? Well, the way you're talkin', it doesn't feel much like a team, lieutenant.
Belichek: Lieutenant rose...
nice internment camp you got goin' up there.
Conrad: Not now.
Belichek: You've held those people for close to 8 hours.
technically, they're waiting for questioning.
Belichek: I'm familiar with the strategy of interviewing a fugitive's family members.
are you familiar with unlawful detention, bordering on kidnapping?
let' em go.
there've been enough mistakes on this case as it is.
excuse me?
Valenza: Jin-lee park was 2 feet from you and you lost him?
you'd rather we have a dozen dead civilians in the alley?
I'd rather he never made it to the alley.
well, we all want things.
we need to minimize the damage.
that's my line.
Valenza: This feels like a high-speed pursuit, and the harder we try to keep up, the more damage we do.
what are you sayin'?
maybe you should back off.
Conrad: They're blowin' people's heads off for fun!
I don't know how to back off now!
you are way over the line.
lady, that's what they pay me to do.
Ahem. I've got the interview reports.
and I'm not leaving till all that paperwork is done.
ms. Belichek, you got blood on your cheek.
didn't know you had any.
that can get infected.
come with me, and I'll patch it up for you.
stick her in front of a mirror while you're at it.
see if you get a reflection.
blow me, lieutenant.
Valenza: This is your call, connie, but the wrong one sinks us both.
hello.
pardon me.
Hi, what can I help you with?
Yeah. I was just wondering if you could tell me what's going on here?
sure. We're conducting an investigation and a search for a member of your family.
who?
I've never heard of him.
you haven't?
no.
come on.
why are you assuming that i would lie to you?
well, most people see a badge, they forget their own name.
I come from a very large family.
just because i share the same last name with somebody doesn't mean know them...
of that I would lie for them.
I didn't say that.
then why did you bring us all in here today?
we're done talking, ok?
why don't you go take a seat?
mm, this looks really bad.
how'd this happen?
one of the suspects head-butted me.
I'm sorry.
at least it hurts as bad as it looks.
ms. Belichek?
would you mind if I asked you out to dinner sometime?
Yes, I would.
I don't date guys with studs in their lips.
Gronbeck: She checked out the stud, man.
you know what that means.
no, I don't.
wondering how long we're gonna keep the families waiting.
some of them are pretty shaken up.
that's the idea.
sir, you have 80-year-olds out there, sitting on the concrete floor.
I do? I have them out there? It's all me?
don't you want to take some credit?
if they stay out there all night, it's good.
I need somebody to talk, somebody to help us stop the bloodshed.
sir, I know a little bit about draggin' people into cop shops because of the color of their skin.
saw my dad get dragged out of bed more than once.
lieutenant, we can't burn the village to save it.
what are you talkin' about?
we can't break the law in order to preserve the peace.
Conrad: That's not what we're doin'.
Merced: That's exactly what we're doing, and that's not what i signed up for.
north vietnamese had this tactic.
they'd roll into a village suspected of cooperating with the U. S. Army, they'd grab some kid, tie him to a tree, and then start cutting off his arms and legs until somebody told them what they came to hear, and a friend of mine was a sniper there, and he'd survey the villages that the vc might be targeting, and if he saw them tie up some poor kid and start cuttin', he would shoot the child to save it from suffering.
that was his job.
Jesus.
no. Jesus was not in attendance on those days.
my job is to stop suffering.
my job is to apprehend those who kill, rape, or otherwise break the peace.
my job is to level the playing field, and if you two don't see that, then you should quit.
either one of you start some half-assed morality debate with me again, i will beat you both until your heart stops.
got it?
Connie, Valenza just called.
we got a dead body.
shit.
ms. Belichek.
have you started your after-action report?
gotten to the critique yet?
I haven't filled out that section yet, ma'am.
I'd like your opinion unofficially.
all due respect, I don't feel comfortable weighing in before my boss.
lieutenant Rose isn't your boss.
my office is.
I know this team's approach is different from what you're used to.
that's why you're here.
now, when he ran into the alley, how would you characterize the attempted take-down?
