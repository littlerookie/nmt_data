well, why don't you two go on ahead, and we'll be in in a minute.
we will?
I'm starving.
then why don't you show them the table and come back out and talk to me for a minute?
all right.
what are you doing? You were supposed to introduce him to me.
semantics. You said you wanted to see him.
you said nothing about meeting him.
he's not her type.
look, we'll talk about this later.
Lucy, you have some 'splaining to do.
maybe we should order.
Yeah.
you said that i looked familiar. What did you mean?
like i've seen you somewhere before.
I get like this a lot lately.
do you smell that?
the bread?
no. Uh, sweet...
like gardenia?
Oh, that's my perfume. It's too much, maybe.
no. No, l...
I've been smelling it for such a long time, i just... i can never figure out where it's coming from.
excuse me. There's a couple over there in the corner, breaking up.
I think they need you more than we do right now.
thank you.
play a happy song, at least.
what sort of work do you do?
I'm a teacher, fourth grade.
I haven't felt much like working since...
I love kids.
they're the only original thinkers in the world.
Really?
do you have any kids?
no. Hell, no.
I've had a lot of health problems lately, so i figured i'd never be around long enough to... have them.
sorry. Did i say something?
no. I'm sorry. I do this a lot lately.
me, too.
you cry?
especially lately.
I don't know why. I just...
I'll see something...
the look on someone's face or...
or the way a dog watches me...
and all of a sudden, i just...
can't stop crying.
are you ok?
I'm sorry. I have to go.
excuse me.
cliff: Was that a date?
Melinda: Did it feel like one?
considering she left before we even ordered food, i'd say, roughly, yes.
that's my usual date.
but what did you think of her?
I feel like [chuckles]
I know her.
how weird is that?
I felt...
Ah, forget it.
Ooh. Forget it.
no. She's someone worth knowing.
take a chance.
Why?
look, you're all about avoiding. I get it.
but just ask yourself this: Why did you accept that heart?
was it to avoid death, or was it to choose life?
I think you owe me an explanation.
OK, it seemed to me like cliff and gwen might have some things in common.
me.
she doesn't need this.
can't you see how much pain she's in?
we had a deal.
you promised you would cross over.
Gwen's not ready.
Conor, let me me honest.
it's not gwen that has the problem here. It's you.
and it's not like she doesn't want to move on, it's that you won't let her.
that is ridiculous. I don't interfere in any way.
she feels your presence. She know you're there, and you're holding her back by staying in her life, and this thing with cliff... it's not about him.
it's about her taking a step.
it's about her moving forward and you letting go.
she loves me.
I know that, conor, and i know that you love her, too.
but she can't love a dead man, not the way that you want her to, and you can't love her the way that she wants you to, the way that she needs you to, and it's not right to expect it.
everything all right?
Melinda: Yeah.
sorry if we woke you.
this one's having a bit of a boundary problem.
don't they all?
OK.
Ahem.
let's have gwen decide.
what?
tomorrow.
we'll ask gwen straight out what she wants, and i'll respect her wishes, but if she says that she wants me to stay with her...
I want you to leave us both alone.
Teresting conversation.
I asked the tax board who paid my bill, and they said it was one andrea moreno.
I didn't want you to know.
obviously.
how do you have this kind of money?
I have a little nest egg put away.
and it's fine, ok? So don't worry.
l... i'm...
stunned.
and...
I can't... i can't accept it.
it's just too much.
look, just pay me back when you can afford it, ok?
or, better yet, um...
you could accept the $15, 000 as a down payment.
for what?
for... making me your partner.
Andrea, i already consider you my partner.
Melinda, i love it here.
you know, i love the people, and i love this place, and i have a little bit of money put away, and i could pay you something really fair, and we could grow this place together.
I don't know what to say.
well... say, "yes.
I mean, "yes," is all you have to say.
you could say, "yes.
Yes.
yeah? Yes?
Yes, i would love for you to be my partner.
Oh, thank you so much. You don't know how much this means to me.
I'm so happy.
I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about the whole man\woman thing and why i've never been too good at it.
maybe it's because i would always hide inside my illness.
I never had to give too much.
I never had to take too much.
after all, i had other things to worry about, like "would i be alive next week?
and after a while, i...
I stopped thinking about it, and it got easier to be alone, didn't have to take any chances, the joys of a risk-free life.
and now...
I have this...
strong, new heart...
and i can feel it beating inside my chest, like it wants to come out, like it's saying, "give me more.
and...
I don't want to...
stop this feeling, but...
I wanna fill it.
like i, uh...
I have to fill it.
and i don't even know if i know... how, exactly.
but i'm gonna try.
can he be talking about gwen?
you never told me what you thought of cliff.
is conor here?
you can speak freely.
I did like cliff.
I did. He was funny.
I feel like i'm being unfaithful.
it's like conor is my guardian angel.
it's so comfortable when he's here, so familiar.
so safe?
being with cliff, even for a few minutes last night, it was...
fun.
I feel like i knew him.
we talked about kids for a second, and it made me want to go back to work.
but i crave conor so much.
I love you so much.
all i want is to be with you every day and every night.
just like it used to be.
will you... will you tell her that, please?
he's telling you that he loves you, that he wants to be with you all the time.
I love you, too, conor.
but i don't want you to live a risk-free life.
you shouldn't waste your heart on a dead man.
he's letting you go, gwen.
no.
no, conor.
no. I didn't mean what i said before.
I want you.
don't... let me go.
I can't do this without you.
that's why i have to go.
what is he saying?
what...
he's leaving.
Gwen, he's crossing over.
wait until after i go, and then tell her when she thinks of all the things we did...
it'll remind her that love is possible.
conor... what?
she'll find it again.
I will.
what? What... what is he saying?
I love you.
he's gone.
he's gone.
I have been dying to do this since we moved here.
Saturday night, grandview players.
high drama.
I just hope the theater isn't haunted.
be nice to sit through the entire play.
Hey. You know, cliff and gwen saw this last week, and they loved it.
what do you think's gonna happen with those two?
who knows?
it almost doesn't matter.
you know, they're good for each other right now.
that's all that counts.
right now...
is all that counts.
Mm. You think so?
as in, "why don't you and i sneak out right now?
don't you have a life to save... or two?
probably. Whatever.
Yeah. I should get back to work, too.
Oh, look, i'll lose these.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I just got married.
just moved to a small town. Just opened up an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except from the time that I was a little girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them.
the ones who have not crossed over yet because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
to tell you my story, I have to tell you theirs.
it'll be a great chance for us to break out and meet new people and make new customers.
you do not have to be the one standing up in front of a jillion strangers. You are gonna be great.
besides, I set up 50 auctions in the city.
they're fun. Where's the light?
does all this junk have to come out?
Yeah. Everything.
look, I can get a pro to do the auction, but it's gonna cost us so much.
and you're beautiful, and everyone's gonna listen to you.
then how come you don't listen to me when I tell you no?
I'm listening to you. I'm just not paying you any attention.
you're funny.
an auctioneer could be a cool thing to have on my resume.
thank you. You're gonna love it.
Ooh. Cool.
creepy.
you smell smoke?
it's probably the old furnace.
what was that?
you feel that?
Oh, god. What is it?
rats.
Oh, I hate rats.
OK. Uh, this will be me calmly going back upstairs.
I know you're there.
this is our stuff. Leave it be.
this is our stuff. Leave it be.
Yeah. Who do you think you are?
now, get out of here before we do something you don't like.
was it rats?
no. Little boys. Ghost little boys?
one or two that I saw and a dog.
a dog? A ghost pet?
they wanted us out of there.
works for me. No, I'm serious.
it looks like they've been here for a long time.
my grandma used to always say that if a child ghost gets attached to a place, it's really hard to cross 'em over.
what do you do if they won't leave?
makes my job harder, but I can't just leave 'em here.
they have to have somebody waiting for them on the other side.
good morning, ladies. How's it going?
we're getting there. It's a lot of stuff.
I don't believe we've met.
I'm Andrea Moreno. I'm Melinda's partner.
dirk Abrams, the last occupant of Kensington Arms.
Mr. Abrams is also the owner.
former owner, sorry to say.
where did you find this?
Oh, down in the basement.
so was it a hotel back then as well?
an orphanage.
it was an orphanage?
St. Michael's home for boys.
built in the '20s.
Wow. This place has not changed a bit.
Oh, it has.
there was a bad fire in 1956.
destroyed half the place.
was anyone killed in the fire?
uh, several young boys.
uh, very sad.
it was a big story around here for a long time.
Andrea, why don't you show Mr. Abrams everything that we brought up so far, and I'll be right there.
uh, so... take a look.
all right.
here you go.
rat wants to talk to you.
and who's Rat?
you'll find out.
follow me.
you, come here.
excuse me?
we got ourselves a problem here, lady.
let's try names. I'm Melinda.
he's Rat. I'm Marty.
and Victor's hiding somewhere. That's what he does.
who dialed your number? Sorry, Rat.
how come you can see us?
um, it's a gift i have. I was born with it.
some gift. What makes you think you can just walk out of here with our stuff?
it's not really your stuff.
it belongs to Mr. Abrams, and he hired us to auction it off for him.
now, do you boys understand why?
we know we're dead, lady. We ain't stupid.
we are?
shut up.
look, we don't want no action.
auction. Whatever.
this is our house. This is where we live, and that's our furniture.
we want it back. Now, run along.
you know, let me explain something to you, r...
do I really need to call him Rat?
man, I wish I was there for that.
now, wait. How is it they can make things explode again?
they build up so much energy that they can get really powerful.
then... they break things.
great. Another fun fact from Melinda.
I'm gonna go back to the shop with these guys and unload.
see you later. Meet you down there.
wait for me.
excuse me, young lady.
may I ask what you're doing?
and you are?
this is my property. Oh. I'm sorry.
I'm Melinda Gordon.
we're getting ready to have an auction.
tobias Northrop.
Oh. Hello.
Mr. Abrams has told me a lot about you.
he said that you saw this place on the internet and bought it over the phone.
I wanted to check with Mr. Abrams and make sure he'll have everything out by Sunday.
we're right on schedule. What are you gonna do with it?
bed and breakfast? I'm gonna tear it down.
but why?
good day, Miss Gordon.
go.
nice to meet you.
Marty said you told him we were dead.
you didn't know?
Yeah. I knew.
I mean, we never get hungry.
we never sleep.
Really?
and nobody can see us.
except you.
it's got to be dead.
Wow.
you are very smart.
Yeah.
but I'm afraid of the dark.
Oh!
me, too.
will you spend the night with us?
what?
Oh... sweetie, I don't think I can.
I have to go home.
do you ever leave the inn?
no. Rat says our feet will catch fire.
why would he say that?
he's real smart about that kind of stuff.
what did you say your name was again?
I wish I could help you.
nobody stays no more.
everyone just leaves.
no. Lew Peterson?
he's the only friend I have who actually knows how to put a furnace in.
but is he reliable? You haven't seen him in months.
Yeah, since our wedding.
I know Lew's not exactly a poster boy for good manners, but...
he's your friend. Yeah.
and I respect that, and I wouldn't come between the two of you.
but let's face it. He's rude and he's crude.
he's an eighth-grader with a car.
he speaks well of you. He doesn't like me.
he thinks I'm the Yoko Ono of your friendship, that I stole you away from the bars and the nightlife.
all right. I'll ask him to stay somewhere else while we work on the house.
you asked him to stay here?
now we're gonna have to host him tonight and for the rest...
actually, I was kind of hoping that you would host him tonight.
I got paged for the midnight to 8 shift, and I really...
well, in that case, there is something that I have to do tonight that I forgot to tell you.
well, it's a little extreme.
3 little boys need my help.
3 dead boys.
you're gonna spend the night in a haunted house...
the bush.
your plant. A haunted house alone?
I feel like I'm in a John Carpenter film.
I'll probably sleep better there than here with party boy.
and if the inn is destroyed with them in it, they'll be earthbound forever.
and I'm not gonna be alone. Mr. Abrams still has a room there.
Oh. Old Mr. Abrams has a room there.
that makes me feel better. The guy could be a serial killer.
it's safe. I promise.
you promise? I promise.
OK. Just keep thinking about how much money we're saving with Lew helping me put in the furnace.
Oh, whatever it is, it's not worth it.
he's changed. You'll see.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh! Oh!
it's OK. He just grazed it.
Hey, Mel.
Hey, Lew.
you look great.
Oh, you're too kind.
don't burn the house down.
she's still pissed at me.
well, you did pass out before the wedding even started.
and now you just ran over her favorite plant.
my bad.
Mr. Abrams?
uh...
it's Melinda Gordon.
Hello!
Oh!
working late? Hi.
Mr. Abrams, I hope I didn't scare you.
just thought I'd spend the night and get an early start on tomorrow.
you only live a mile up the road.
Yeah, well, it is our first auction.
you know... lot to prove.
whatever.
well, I met Mr. Northrop before.
strange sort of man, isn't he?
did you tell him that this used to be an orphanage?
Nope. He never asked.
did you know that he's planning to tear it down?
he's got the demolition scheduled for Monday.
he does?
I could really use that extra time.
you could?
well, yeah. The extra time to convince him to not tear down this great old place.
thank you.
uh...
do you believe in ghosts, Ms. Gordon?
uh...
Yes.
I do.
I think they're here... now.
they're all around.
I thought you boys wanted company.
you guys have been practicing this stuff for a long time now, huh?
ain't much else to do. What are you doing here?
I thought you asked... I mean...um, I know that you boys are as tough as nails.
especially you.
and I thought maybe I could help.
you wanna help us? Then come downstairs.
Peter pan. That's our favorite.
can you read? No.
none of us can.
Ernie could read. He knew all of the words.
who's Ernie?
he's a pal of ours.
is he here with you?
no. Not for a long time.
so why don't you tell me about Rat and why he's so mad at everybody.
he says you can't trust anybody.
he trusts you.
Yeah, he does.
and he trusted his brother.
he had a brother? Mikey.
it was his little brother.
how come no one ever adopted them?
somebody adopted Mikey.
but they left Rat here.
there was a lot of crying when that happened.
so he has a brother out there.
he got drowned.
big wave hit him at the beach.
that's when Rat said we can only trust each other.
so tell us the story about Peter Pan.
uh, that would be easier if there was some light.
you are very talented.
there was only one boy who never grew up, and his name was Peter Pan.
see him there, floating over their beds?
he came in through the open window while Wendy, Michael, and John were sound asleep.
he taught them to think happy thoughts and sprinkle them with pixie dust so they could...
boys: Fly.
I know what you're trying to do.
you're trying to get us out of here.
Melinda, you slept at the inn?
those kids needed me.
they're under the influence of this older kid, Rat.
there's a ghost named Rat?
Yeah. If I don't get them to cross over before that building is torn down...
torn down? But that's such a great old place.
that's why the new owner is gonna hear from the Grandview Historical Society.
I didn't know there was a Grandview Historical Society.
there isn't yet.
Hey, you should be vice president.
I got a "no. " Anybody got a "no"?
I got a "no" in the back.
I got a big fat "no."
sold.
Grandview historical society.
never heard of it.
well, it's a small group.
we wanna present you with some options so that you can still make a profit.
ms. Gordon, what's wrong with providing luxury housing for hundreds, as opposed to an old hotel that nobody stays at anymore?
can you just postpone the demolition?
give us some time to... to what?
to look for a way to preserve a crumbling structure that once housed hapless orphans.
ms. Gordon, I appreciate the good work you're trying to do, but new construction it will be.
baby?
sorry, Mel. I didn't hear you.
that's OK.
I'm used to it.
this stuff really works. I can feel my skin tightening.
it, uh, tingles.
Where's Jim?
don't know.
I'm exhausted. Can you just get him out of here for the night?
take him to the movies or something.
you don't like him at all, do you?
no, it's not that. It's just ... I don't get you two.
I've known the guy since we were 14.
he's the kind of guy you can always call 3: 00 in the morning if you car wouldn't start or you were lost or worse.
he's always been there for me, no questions asked, and that counts for a lot.
OK. I get it.
I'll find something for us to do tonight.
but it ain't gonna be the movies.
why not?
no margaritas.
Oops.
Hi, Mel.
did you guys have fun?
I kept him out of trouble.
honey, you remember Terry and Ralph.
uh, hello.
guys, um, get a beer. Get a beer.
I'm real... I'm sorry about the intrusion. I'm sorry.
no, it's fine. I should get back to the inn anyway.
wait a minute. What, now?
it'll be quieter there. I need to talk to Mr. Abrams.
I won't be long.
I'll keep 'em quiet. I'll put 'em in the backyard.
no, it's OK. You guys have your fun. I just figured it out.
it's not about me not liking Lew.
it's about me not liking who you are around Lew.
I'm sorry that it's so late.
Oh, nonsense. I'm happy for the company.
I've been doing a lot of reading on the fire, and it said that 4 boys were killed.
I thought there were only 3.
no. 4.
Marty, and, uh...
he and Rat were the best of friends.
they were inseparable.
when they found their bodies, you would have expected to find Ernie lying right next to Rat.
but that's not what happened.
they never found Ernie's body.
the 2 little ones were... were holding hands.
the dog was right there with them.
tell him to shut up.
he doesn't know what he's talking about.
later.
sorry?
late.
it's getting late.
right you are.
he's always shooting his damn mouth off!
well... like i said, it gets spooky around here.
you see how Wendy takes care of Peter after he returns home hurt from his battles?
like a mom would do.
Ah, but she was so much more than a mom to Peter.
she was his friend, and they had lots of adventures together.
and that is what made Tinkerbell very jealous.
Oh.
boys, come back.
did I scare them off?
it is so good to see you.
sorry.
I'm sorry.
when you didn't come home, I got worried.
what's wrong?
it's the boys.
they break my heart.
maybe we should stay here tonight.
it's a small bed.
I think we'll manage.
Hey.
what's the matter?
it's something.
Oh, I can't believe it.
they're getting ready for Monday.
if Northrop tears this place down, it's like cutting the string on a balloon.
these kids will have nothing to hold on to.
hello.
I was just hooking the power up to the fuse box.
the whole thing just sort of shorted out on me. Sparks were flying.
it scared the hell out of me.
there's no... fire.
there's no fire, though.
you're just gonna have to do some rewiring.
I'll be right there.
a little, uh, emergency.
Oh, what, the house? Lew's there.
Oh, no. It's, um, nothing we can't handle, OK?
I can do...
you're gonna be all right?
Yeah. All right.
I heard what you said last night.
whoa. What are you talking about?
old man Abrams.
tells the fire story all the time?
he don't know the most important part.
what's the most important part?
I knew the way, all right.
wake up! Wake up!
I always knew what to do.
get up, everyone!
wake up!
get up, everyone! Get up!
that's why they followed me.
no, Rat! No! Up here! Come on!
except this one time.
Ernie, you're going the wrong way!
this one night...
the doors were locked.
who knows why?
new janitor, new rule.
come on. I never knew.
I looked down at the guys.
I could see they were scared.
don't sit down, you guys. We got to find our way out.
come on.
it was my fault.
I got them all killed.
it wasn't your fault. Yes, it was.
you were trying to help them get out.
how could you know that those doors would be locked?
they trusted me. I let them down.
that is not true.
they still love you, don't they?
most of the time they do.
that's because you're a family, Rat. You're Peter.
they're the lost boys, and they need you.
that why I keep 'em together, make sure nothing happens to them.
you can come in, boys.
it's time for you to move on.
you can't stay here forever.
we don't know anything but here.
did you see the bulldozer out front?
they're gonna tear this place down.
and you'll just have to trust me that there's a better place.
there's nothing... nothing to be afraid of.
you think they want us at the place she's talking about?
nobody wants us.
this is the only place we know we're safe.
that's why we stay together.
I'll tell you what.
just come outside with me for one day.
let me prove to you that you can be safe somewhere other than here.
sounds OK. Don't you think, Rat?
if you want your feet to burn, go ahead.
no fire.
he lied.
maybe not.
maybe he really thinks they do go on fire.
come on, boys.
why can't we just stay with you?
well, because...
we both love you and everything.
you could be our mother.
I would be proud to have you two as my sons.
any mother would.
then why can't we?
because you don't belong here anymore.
there's somewhere better.
can you go swimming there?
eat ice cream?
uh, I don't know for sure.
but what I do know is that you'll be wanted there.
and no one will ever abandon you again.
but you won't be there, will you?
someday.
someday I will.
and for you, it'll feel like no time at all.
if Rat don't go, we don't go.
we're moving on to our next item, ladies and gentlemen...
lot number 85, which is a beautiful late '40s-era cradle.
we're gonna start the bidding at $20.
150!
200!
2, 000! Wonderful. $20.
Shh. 25. OK, wonderful.
uh, 25.
3 million!
can i get 30?
a trillion! Shh!
so that's how it works, huh?
take our stuff, sell it, keep the dough.
you see that store over there? Go.
now.
Andrea: Whoa! Hey! It's not me that's on sale.
we're gonna move on to lot, um, 86.
this isn't about old beat-up furniture, is it, Rat?
there's something I got to ask you.
what is it?
and you can't lie to me either.
I got to know the truth. Grown-ups always lie.
I promise.
am I gonna see my brother Mikey again?
will he be there once we cross over?
Yes, Rat.
your brother will be right there waiting for you.
they said I'd see him again.
a family took him and not me.
they lied.
it's the truth this time, I promise.
and Marty and Vic, they'll come?
they're your family. You'll all be together.
thank you.
well, he can fix it.
I knew it. I didn't think it was that bad.
lew, I can't do this, all right?
do what?
play along, make believe that this does not piss me off.
take it easy. No "take it easy."
you come into my house, you act like a fool.
you disrespect my wife.
I did not... Lew, wake up, OK?
you're my friend, but we're not 18 anymore.
look, pack your stuff. I'll see you later.
fine.
Andrea: 25. OK. Wonderful.
we're at $25.
this lovely lamp here for $25.
do I hear 30? $30.
30. anybody with 35?
$35, sir.
is there anybody for 40?
anybody? OK.
I think I might just bid on this piece.
should've made it part of the deal with Abrams.
you're Ernie, aren't you?
you're the boy that got away.
that's how you knew that the Kensington was an orphanage.
you were there.
you don't have to pay me. It belongs to you.
you have me confused with somebody else.
ernest Sutter. That was your name, wasn't it?
no idea what you're talking about.
best of luck with the rest of the auction.
don't go, please.
I cannot tell you how important this is to me and the boys who died there.
you were there, weren't you?
I wanna level that horrible place.
I wanna turn it into a grave.
I've spent 50 years trying to outrun those memories.
and every child I pass on the sidewalk, every photo in a magazine, I see them.
they died and I lived. Why?
you were only a child.
they were my family.
I can help you.
how?
boy: Come on!
I used to hide in the basement.
my alone place.
no one ever looked for me down there.
sometimes I'd just sleep or daydream.
or sometimes I'd read.
I kept my little secrets down there...
matches, candle.
that night, though that night I heard Homer barking.
I thought he was in trouble.
I went to find him.
I meant to come back.
I meant to blow out the candle.
but one thing led to another.
they called bedtime.
I forgot all about it.
wake up!
I didn't even remember it until later.
when the fire started, i was just trying to get out like everyone else.
no, Rat! No!
Ernie, it's the wrong way! Come on!
No! Up here!
Ernie! Up here! Come on!
and when i saw it burning and i didn't see the boys get out...
I ran.
I just kept running.
somehow I knew that no matter what, I was not coming back here.
next day I saw the front page of a newspaper.
I saw the pictures of the fire and the boys, and one of them was me.
12-year-old orphan, Ernest Sutter, was dead.
I remember climbing into a trash bin and crying till my throat hurt.
this was my friend Rat's hideout.
he hated his name. Loved his nickname.
he was one tough customer.
nobody messed with you if you were OK with Rat.
you got to tell him.
what if I told you that Rat was still here?
what?
the boys are still here.
I don't understand. They're not dead?
they are dead.
but their spirits...
well, they were afraid to move on.
that can't be. I don't believe in that kind of stuff.
Yeah. Most people don't.
tell him...it's still there...where he hid it.
uh, he says that it's still there where you hid it.
this must be a dream.
rat, is that you?
tell him to use his indoor voice. We ain't deaf.
he says for you to use your indoor voice.
we ain't deaf.
son of a... it is Rat.
tell him homer's here.
you got your teeth fixed. You're really getting old.
Hey, one at a time.
OK. They want you to know that Homer's here.
Marty thinks you're getting old, and Rat says your teeth are fixed?
no cavities.
they're all false. Mine fell out.
they're laughing.
Where's Rat?
right in front of you.
you were the brave one, Rat.
you were trying to save us.
you always knew the right thing to do.
I can't tell you how many times when I was out on the road and I'd think back on all the things you taught me.
not book things. Like how to survive and laugh at yourself.
and I'm still always thinking, what would Rat do if he was here?
you're so full of it, Ernie, it's coming out of your ears.
he wants to know if you really think that.
Yes, I do.
I would give all the money I have in the world to see you one more time.
all of you.
you ain't gonna make me cry, Ernie.
he's crying.
don't tell him that. Tell him that he could tear down the inn if he wants.
we're going.
rat says they're leaving.
where are they going?
on a new adventure.
good-bye, pal.
do you see it?
Yeah.
a light.
handsome.
I'm telling everybody that you're my mom.
I ain't scared, Rat.
me neither.
I can see my brother.
he's laughing at me.
wherever I've been, he wants to know.
good-bye, Wendy.
good-bye, Peter.
are they gone?
Yes.
I never felt like this before.
like I'm... I'm... free.
thank you.
I hate to admit it, but now I kind of feel sorry for him.
me, too.
he changed, I guess.
I don't know.
I don't think he changed. You did.
all I know is that I'm glad I have you.
um, do you wanna explain that?
tomorrow. Let's just go back to bed.
Yeah.
stop.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I just got married, just moved to a small town, just opened up an antique shop.
I might be just like you.
except from the time that I was a little girl,
I knew that I could talk to the dead.
it's all right, honey.
earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them, the ones who have not crossed over yet because they have unfinished business with the living, and they come to me for help.
to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.
so today, 25 years after Judge Walter Merrick took his oath of office, we are here to dedicate this courthouse in his name.
these qualities have earned him the deep respect which he so richly deserves.
so how come I've never heard of this guy?
maybe you need to be on trial more often.
you're hilarious yeah.
fair, impartial, and open-minded, a man of learning and knowledge
I've seen his name in the paper a few times.
he gives lots of money to local charities.
and now I'd like all of you to stand with me...
on this momentous occasion...
as we honor this great man.
maybe he should give some money for some new color guard uniforms.
stop!
he's lucky you got there in time.
he's lucky he's alive.
I figured this for a heart attack or a stroke, but nothing showed up on the test?
nothing will.
what did you see?
a man, maybe 40 and angry.
very angry. It's like he was trying to suck the life right out of the judge.
well, he almost succeeded.
Yeah, things are definitely changing out there.
I heard that.
what did you feel?
it was almost like I was being smothered, or choking.
I don't know. It's like there's more and more spirits out there that are dangerous, and they have even more power to hurt people.
maybe even kill them.
maybe this has been happening all the time.
maybe you're just seeing more now.
I don't think so.
Hey, Mr. Slade.
Hey!
I was taken advantage of!
18 years I worked here.
what did I get?! Nothing!
no respect! Look at me when I'm talking to you, fool!
Hey! I grew up in this town.
I had a future.
I got a family.
I got a son.
you don't think I wanna be with my family?
and he took it all away from me!
you don't deserve this, Judge Merrick!
you will never see this dedication to your good name!
Never! Never! Never!
so why was he at the hardware store?
Mike's remodeling. Sometimes it can stir things up.
Oh.
remember how I was thinking we should put some new shelves in the back?
let's not.
I lost everything!
Where's my justice?
Where's my justice, huh?!
Where's my justice for me?!
I'll be right back.
you two!
you two! You think you're friends?!
that was a nice trip.
you'd get justice, wouldn't ya?
you know why? 'Cause you're white!
and you, you wouldn't get nothing!
no justice for you, boy! No justice for you!
justice for what?
excuse me?
I can help you.
wait. Wait, don't go.
too late to help!
for my hardware store to compete with the big chains out on the highway,
I've got to update the store, you know?
give it a little polish.
your table's ready.
sell some hard-to-find items. Uh, you know, personal service...
the whole deal.
so how's the construction going? Any problems?
sure. Everything costs twice as much as my contractor said it would be.
that's not really what I meant. I meant, uh, noises, things being moved, cold drafts.
things that go bump in the night?
did anyone die there?
you know about that?
no, not really. I'm just trying to learn everything I can about the town, good and bad.
Yeah, it was back when my dad had the store.
1974 or '75.
Yeah, one of the employees got killed.
in the store?
no, I don't think so.
Why? You think I might have ghosts or something?
no. Um, I just have a very morbid curiosity.
you ever notice how people will shop like crazy in a pouring rain, but one clap of thunder and they scurry home like roaches?
hmm. Roaches. Nice visual.
I liked it.
and where is the rain, by the way?
it's been thundering for, like 2 hours and not a cloud in the sky.
here, this is him.
ely Fisher attacked a white co-worker, Link Hofstadter, when he insulted him.
Ooh. Must have been one serious insult.
then Link killed him, but no charges were ever filed.
why does that sound backwards to me?
they were saying there was rumblings of racism.
you think?
what? It was almost 30 years ago.
it's hard to imagine that people still think like that, especially here.
did I ever tell you my vodka story?
no.
I was in this liquor store looking for a good bottle of wine, but they didn't have a really good selection. So I'm leaving, behind this pretty blonde, and the alarm goes off.
and then the security guard practically tackles me.
they thought you were shoplifting?
the blonde had put a bottle of vodka under her coat.
and she didn't know there was a sensor on it, but--well,
I was the one that they saw.
I didn't think stuff like that still happened, at least not in the city.
it wasn't in the city.
Melinda, it was right here in Grand View.
you see things I don't and vice-versa.
Yeah, but most people in this town are not like that.
well, I don't know all of them.
I didn't know any of them in 1975.
what else does it say?
ely, he had a wife and a young son.
Oh! Wait.
Wow. Judge Merrick.
Yeah, he was the prosecuting attorney.
he was also the one who didn't file charges against Link.
so why is Ely suddenly back?
I don't think he's too happy that Judge Merrick is being honored.
all right. I'm ready to do the whole "scurry and roach" thing myself right now.
see you tomorrow.
have fun. - Ok, thanks. Bye.
really, go ahead and eat.
no, I'll wait.
lasagna.
tastes better when it's reheated anyway.
I'll be home in an hour.
you sound a little funny. What's going on?
I'll explain later.
look, the weather stinks. Do you have to go see this judge tonight?
Yeah, I think I do.
listen, do you know anybody at the courthouse that might know where the Fisher's moved after Ely died?
well, that depends.
on what?
on whether or not you really come home in an hour.
9:02.
check.
drive safe, babe.
Bye.
stop it!
thank you.
the nurse said someone's coming to repair the monitor.
I can stay until they get here.
2 close calls in one week.
this is getting to be a habit.
is there anything I can do?
I think saving my life was enough for one night.
you were at the ceremony, weren't you?
um, is there anyone I can get in touch with for you?
no. My wife passed a few years ago.
haven't seen my brother in years.
now, if i die...
I'm sure there would be a few people happy to get that call.
people you sent to jail?
most of them are still in jail.
my sentences stuck.
I was proud of that.
beg your pardon?
he died in 1975. You were a prosecutor then.
sweetie, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning much less 30 years ago.
this is gonna sound strange, but I think you might be in danger.
please.
the only danger I face is my cholesterol.
and I'm getting a little tired now.
of course.
maybe I'll come back another time.
Mr. Merrick, are you all right?
oh...I'm all right.
Yeah, yeah.
your father was Ely Fisher.
he worked at the hardware store in Grand View.
who wants to know?
my name is Melinda Gordon.
how'd you get this number, lady?
dad, you said you 'd-- - just hold on! One second, buddy.
my husband works for the county, and he looked up some courthouse records.
courthouse?
Yeah. I'm doing some research, and I was wondering if we could discuss it. I could come to Martinsville.
what do you want, lady?
daddy, come on.
hush, Jameel.
Walter Merrick. Do you know him?
Yeah, I know Merrick.
he's the man who killed my mother when I was 7.
your mother...
I'm sorry. I knew that your father had died.
my father didn't just die.
my father was murdered.
I can't believe it.
I lose my father, my mother, and Judge Merrick gets a building named after him.
what am I saying?
of course I can believe it.
you said he killed your mother. How?
do I know you...
or what you want?
why should I tell you anything?
you came here, didn't you?
I came to visit my aunt Rose.
well, I think there's more to the story than what's in the newspaper.
a white man killed my father and got away with it.
that's the story.
come on, dad. Let's go.
look, I'm sorry, ok?
I didn't mean to... to upset you or your dad.
I just want to help, both of you.
help? How are you gonna help him?
come here.
look, you see that store right there?
that's where your granddaddy worked.
see that alley down there?
that's where he died.
your grandfather worked in that hardware store for 18 years.
and then Mr. Slade hired that punk Link Hofstadter.
I don't need to be treated this way, not by any man.
ely. Ely, wait. It's the only fair way.
with all due respect, Mr. Slade.
I've come to work on time for 18 years.
never took one sick day.
and you're gonna start him at a dollar more an hour than you pay me?
how is that fair?
you think I'd work for less than some colored man?
his father,
I owe him a favor.
Oh, yeah, I know.
everybody around here owes the Hofstadters a favor.
and this one can't tell the difference between a lamp shade an a light socket.
Hey! You watch your mouth, boy!
and that night...
that night, Link waited on him, jumped him and killed him in cold blood.
dad, my hand.
link said that it was self-defense.
and the newspapers, they say
the Hofstadters own the newspapers.
and they own half the mortgages on the properties in Grand View.
but there were no witnesses.
I heard there was a witness, and the Hofstadters paid them off, whoever they were.
is there any proof?
that's just what Merrick said, the man whose name is on that plaque back there.
go away! Get lost!
I was about the same age as Jameel.
and my mother couldn't believe that Merrick was not gonna press charges.
my mother wasn't gonna just let it go.
she wanted justice.
but Judge Merrick told her there were no witnesses and that it was Link's word against hers.
but she knew.
Mrs. Fisher, your husband threatened to kill Link.
there was a witness!
she knew my father would never hurt anyone.
it was self-defense.
at least put it in front of a grand jury.
let them decide.
randall: My mother died that day.
they said it was a heart attack. And I guess they were right.
cause her heart broke that day.
that's a horrible thing for a 7-year-old to see.
do you think I want your sympathy?
do you know what became of Link?
Yeah, I kept track of that bastard.
he got sick a couple of years ago and died in the comfort of his home, surrounded by his wife and kids.
get outta here!
come on!
you know what's weird? Ely never showed himself today.
maybe he's all gone now.
that's what I love about you: Forever an optimist
it was more like standing on that square, you could see Ely's anger on his son's face.
they make the same expressions when they're mad...
which is all the time.
well, the man's father was killed, probably in a hate crime.
nothing was done.
that would pretty much make me mad all the time.
I get it. I do. It's just...
so sad to see such an angry little boy, that hatred passed down from father to son.
that's the way of the world, my love.
always has been.
you know, maybe if I get them together, the judge could tell Randall what happened and break they cycle.
right.
and then they could get started on that pesky little Gaza Strip thing.
I'm serious.
there's a reason I am pulled into these people's lives.
I know, I know.
some things are beyond your help, anybody's help.
some people, all they wanna do is hold on to their hatred.
well, I won't know unless I try.
wait. You mean now?
Yeah. I can't sleep anyway.
I'm coming with you.
no. You might scare him off.
he does not sound like a guy who scares easy.
please? There's nothing you can do.
wait. What are you saying?
I'm supposed to wait here while you go out in this weather looking for this...
whatever he is?
no. Don't wait.
get some rest. I'll be home soon.
who are you?
what do you want?!
what have I done to you?!
I know what happened to you, to your wife and your son.
what about my son?
he's in pain.
he's filled with hatred.
he should be.
no, you're wrong.
it's gonna ruin his life.
look, I can help you talk to the judge
I'll talk to him when he's dead like me, and that's what I'll make him before he ever gets a chance to see that dedication to his good name.
don't do this. There's a better way.
I'm taking him!
you better stand back, or I may have to take you, too.
there are people over here who are very interested in you.
Aah! - Hey, it's ok. It's ok.
don't be mad.
I spent a lot of time on that case.
interviewed dozens of people.
I was a brand-new prosecutor, and I wanted to make my bones.
the Hofstadters are very powerful.
is that why you decided not to prosecute?
no. If ambition were my only concern, a murder trial would have been the best way to get my name in the papers.
everything isn't in black and white.
interesting choice of words.
no, I knew Link Hofstadter.
I knew his family.
he was a fine young man.
you want to know what really happened that night?
I come to work on time for 18 years, damn you, took crap from customers who let me carry their refrigerator to the damn door but then got nervous when I took it inside.
customers who made me put their change on the counter so we wouldn't accidentally touch hands.
but I took it.
Oh, I smiled. I said thank you, and you're paying him a dollar more an hour than you pay me?
his father,
I owe him a favor.
a dollar more!
and this meathead can't tell the difference between a lampshade and a light socket.
I'd watch your mouth, boy.
don't you ever call me boy. You dumbass cracker.
just stop it. Call me boy again, you're dead!
that's enough. We're okay.
I won't have this. Not in my store.
one more fight, I fire you both.
that night, Ely waited for him.
ely could take care of himself.
he was good with his fists.
Hey, boy,
I got somethin' for you.
come on. Come on, cracker.
show me what you got.
come on.
come on, cracker!
come on, show me what you got. - I'm not losing my job over you.
come on.
come on, boy.
come on, boy.
come on.
it was a case of self-defense.
how do you know that? You weren't even there.
I took statements from the people who saw the two of them arguing in the street.
the medical reports backed up everything Link said.
I came to this very hospital to question him that night.
he had two broken ribs, and he needed 19 stitches to close up his cheek.
and Ely?
the blow to his head killed him instantly.
link was all torn up about it.
I doubt he ever forgave himself.
there were rumors about a witness.
Oh, I knew about the rumors. They were never substantiated.
not one.
why are you digging all this up? Why now?
Ely's family feels like there was an injustice done.
I'm sure they do.
it was a tragedy from every side.
but you can't bring criminal charges against a man, ruin his good name, maybe taint him for life, for defending himself.
daddy, why are you crying?
look, I'm not crying.
it's just the wind. It blew something in my eye.
it's real windy in the square.
then why are we sitting here so long?
maybe...
I don't know.
makes me feel closer to my dad.
I feel a little mixed up.
come on, let's go.
but daddy, you told me never to cry.
Yeah, that's right. Don't you ever let anybody make you cry.
you only trust your own kind.
that's how you stay strong.
that's how you stay ready.
ready for what?
ready for places like this.
he looks just like in the pictures.
who?
what are you talking about, Jameel?
grandpa.
come on, let's go.
but, dad, he's standing right there. I swear.
I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.
no way, our insurance doesn't cov...
the boy, he can see me.
lots of kids can see spirits.
uh, are you talking to me?
okay, should I get ready to run screaming from the store?
I'll get back to you on that one.
how come he can see me?
I don't really know.
they usually grow out of it by the time they're eight or nine.
when they realize they're not supposed to be seeing them.
your grandson's seven, I think.
so why didn't you talk to him?
I don't know what to say.
Yes, you do.
wait, hey, oh, no.
are you gonna leave me here alone with the...
all right.
I'll be in the back if, uh...
if you need me.
Hi.
there's something I need to show you in my store.
where are we going, daddy?
don't worry about it.
what's your name?
Mm-hmm, second grade.
who's he talking to?
what's going on here?
the other night when I called, it's because I had seen your father.
What're you talking about? My father's dead.
your dad, he can't see me, can he?
no, just me and the lady.
What're you, some kind of grifter?
what, you're gonna tell me my future next?
look, I have this gift.
do you still live here?
no, but I did.
all my life.
I was born in the same house your aunt Rose lives in now.
wait a minute, you were born in a house?
what?
back then, lots of people were. Couldn't afford the hospitals.
granddaddy was born in a house, not a hospital.
they were too poor.
how are you doing this?
I'm not.
me and your aunt Rose, we slept in a dresser drawer when we were babies.
then Celia came along, they finally bought a crib.
who's Celia?
she passed when she was just a little thing.
she drowned down in a pond.
I was supposed to be watching her.
daddy, is that why you won't let me go swimming unless you watch?
cause granddaddy wasn't watching Celia?
all right, what is this?
only me and my family knows that story.
your father knows.
my father.
he's here.
he is, daddy.
all right, if granddad's here, ask him what happened that night.
it's not like what Link Hofstadter said.
came out of the barn, and I could smell the alcohol on him.
Hey, sambo.
come here. I got something for you.
Mr. Hofstadter,
I didn't mean nothing about what I said at the store today.
come on, boy, show me some of your sass now!
I'm not losing my job over you.
I heard his ribs crack.
but he wasn't gonna let me win.
what would he tell his redneck friends?
it wasn't like Link said.
I was just going to get some milk for your daddy's breakfast.
my daddy gives me milk for my breakfast too.
he wasn't looking for a fight.
that's what my mom said.
nobody would listen.
she cried, she cried, she couldn't work.
she lost her job.
I just wanted a way to make them pay, Link and that prosecutor.
he wanted to punish Link and Merrick.
well, wait, if he's still here, after all this time, how come he didn't talk to me?
I was the same age as Jameel is right now.
I didn't know I could.
I was just trying to make them pay.
you know what it would've meant, pop?
if I could just see you?
to just know that you were there.
teach me the things that a father is supposed to teach his son.
it's not like that, Randall.
he just didn't know that he could.
what about mom?
where were you when she died?
and where is she?
tell him I was there that day.
Rachel saw this light, she wanted me to come with her, but I couldn't, I just couldn't.
your mother crossed over.
and your father couldn't because he was too angry.
well, I know all about the anger.
all right, cause that's all he left me.
what good has he done, huh?
wait!
back there you asked me where he was when you needed him to teach you the things fathers teach their sons.
there are some things you need to teach your son.
maybe even some things you need to teach your father.
Yeah, well, my father's gone.
either you're working some scam, or you're just plain crazy.
I'm not, and you know it.
she's not, daddy.
please, come with me to see Judge Merrick.
and do what?
lay this to rest.
come in.
she your boss?
um, she's my partner.
you're partners with a white lady?
well, she's also my friend, Jameel.
she's my best friend.
my dad says that people wouldn't fight if they stuck with their own kind.
well, your dad's a pretty smart guy.
you know what my kind is?
here.
people who are respectful of others, people who are intelligent, kind, funny, nice to kids, people like melinda.
she's funny?
Oh, she's so funny.
see that's the thing about people, Jameel.
you don't know who they are just by looking at them.
you have to get to know them.
but your dad is absolutely right.
once you find out that someone's your kind, you stick with them.
you owe me.
can I do anything for you?
rain check.
Yeah, I remember, but not now, ok?
it's your turn to help me.
and it's gotta be now.
Why?
because I was working here the night they brought Link Hofstadter in.
I waited two hours for the son of a bitch.
I was just gonna throw him a beating.
show him how he has to treat a white man.
you're the witness.
he told me everything.
this is a nice send-off.
they're letting me out on parole.
I suggested they sentence me to community service, but...
I'm sorry, do I know you?
this is Randall Fisher.
Ely's son.
the two of you will have to excuse me.
I've gotta get dressed.
there was a witness, wasn't there?
a nurse, who came to you.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm going home now.
Hey, I wasn't gonna end him.
maybe he shouldn't have raised his hands to me.
you know, he should've just taken what he had coming.
maybe then I would've left him alive.
Hey, come here. We have to keep this place safe.
for our kind.
but that's not it, is it?
the E. R. Nurse came to you and told you what Link had said to her
Mr. Merrick, I'm the nurse who called you.
link told me everything.
I talked to Link too.
he was drunk.
there's more people to think he got jumped by a black man in an alley and he didn't defend himself.
that's not the story.
well, it's a case I can't win.
so the case is closed.
the next day there was $5, 000 in my checking account.
the Hofstadters put $5, 000 into her checking account.
what?
I didn't know, I swear. She never told me.
you told her that the case was closed.
but if I'd known they paid her...
you should've looked again.
but you wanted to look away.
how do you know all of this anyway?
how do I know you didn't just invent it?
it's the truth.
check the bank records if you don't believe me, but the easier way, is just to do nothing.
this was a stupid argument that got out of hand.
it was an argument over a dollar an hour.
this had nothing to do with a dollar an hour or a seat on a bus or a water fountain.
this is about something bigger and you know it.
I didn't know about the money.
well, you do now.
I just didn't believe he could've done something like this.
we know what you believe, judge, then and now, and we both know why you looked away, don't we?
Walter Merrick was not only a judge in this courthouse for 25 years, he was instrumental in restoring grandview to the town many of us grew up in.
the storm has passed. He's healthy and strong as ever.
judge Walter Merrick.
thank you very much.
I've been recognized as many things in this town.
a tough, but fair-minded judge, a deacon of my church, a good husband.
the one thing I was not known as...
is a racist.
30 years ago, a black man, Ely Fisher was killed right in the square.
the plain truth is,
I assumed Ely Fisher was the guilty one.
I made a judgment call that was callous and bigoted.
it would be easy to say, it was 30 years ago, but the truth is that I was that same man until yesterday.
despite great progress in this country, racism is still very much alive.
it can be subtle, handed down from generation to generation.
this tragedy is my shame.
my debt.
but, if it becomes a reason to change , for even one of you, or one of your children, Ely Fisher's death will have gained new meaning.
so later today,
I will officially recommend that this plaque be removed and that a new one replace it.
one that dedicates this courthouse
Hey, there's grandpa.
Where'd grandpa go?
thank you all for coming, and enjoy the festivities.
is he gone for good?
I don't know.
ely, I...
grandpa, daddy needs to talk to you.
I'm right here.
he's here.
ask him how he feels.
I hardly know.
I'm glad the right thing was done, but it don't change much.
thought I'd feel happy, like I won.
I don't think anyone won.
he's glad that the truth came out, but it didn't change much.
it does, pop.
I thought staying mad all that time really gave me something.
something to stay here for.
something to keep me going.
but it took a lot away too.
from me, from you, even Jameel. And that's gotta stop.
I'm not mad, grandpa.
that's good, little man.
and you make sure your pops doesn't stay mad either.
you tell him he can let go of this now.
he's got a clean slate.
so do I.
I see it.
a light.
I guess it's time.
you're ready.
time for what, grandpa?
to see your grandma Rachel and your aunt Celia.
can I meet them?
no.
not quite yet.
he looks like his mother.
that's a good thing too.
he's glad that you look like your mother.
I thought that it would hurt too much if I knew you.
or if I remembered you too well.
but you left such a big hole.
tell him he grew up strong.
and I'm proud of him for that.
but he's gotta grow up soft now.
he's gotta teach his son to be both.
tell him I said goodbye.
I will.
ely, wait.
before you said that there are people who are interested in me.
who and why me?
I was mad, I didn't mean to scare you.
what did you mean?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
there's a lot I don't understand.
they know about you.
and not everybody is happy about what you do.
No! Jim!
Hey, what is this place?
where am I?
not even a hello for your big brother?
man, I've been waiting here for hours.
hours?
hours, years, who knows. It's all the same.
but I have been waiting for you.
Dan, why are we here?
don't you recognize this place?
dad used to bring you here.
whenever you needed cheering up.
you guys used to fish here, or just dangle your feet off the pier and talk.
we came here when you died.
I know.
I was watching.
now we can go.
go where, Dan?
Duh. Into the light.
I'm supposed to bring you over, that's what I've been waiting for.
the old man told me, "Next time I see you guys, I want to see you together."
dad's there?
I've only seen a glimpse of him.
he also told me I can finally lose the penguin suit when we cross over. So let's go.
Dan, I can't. I have to see Melinda.
Jim, Melinda's gonna be fine.
fine? No, she's not fine. She's a wreck! I have to see her.
I have to talk to her. - She's expecting me. - No, you don't, Jim. Trust me, you don't.
Jim, listen to me!
does Melinda know that you love her?
does everyone you care about know how much you care about them?
Yeah, I think so.
then you're done.
you're ready to cross over.
no.
I can't leave Melinda.
well, do what you gotta do, brother.
that's it. We lost him.
Ned honey, why don't you go and see if there's any recycling that needs to go out, or any mail.
no, it's fine. Don't worry about that stuff.
more tea?
I can't believe I haven't seen him.
he isn't coming to me. It's been 2 days.
maybe...
I don't know. Maybe he crossed over.
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
but wouldn't he have said goodbye?
I mean, he wouldn't just leave, would he?
thanks for pointing that out.
haven't you even felt anything?
Mel, I'm here.
like a presence or something? - I'm right here with you.
I haven't seen a ghost since Jim died.
not that I want to.
honey, we have to settle on a date for the funeral.
I can't.
it's too final. I just can't.
Mel, it's not me.
do you see a ghost?
I'm right here.
I don't see anything.
he's here.
no, it's not me! It's not!
Melinda, why can't you see me?
mom.
everyone's so sad.
it sucks, I know.
but you have to believe that they're all going to be all right.
it's not your job to take care of them anymore.
they'll take care of each other now.
Melinda can't see me.
she doesn't even know I'm there.
it's her grief.
it makes the veil stronger.
it blocks her gift because this is so personal for her.
when she finds some joy again, it'll come back.
I can't leave her like this.
she needs closure.
we both do. - Jim, here's the thing.
you're on the threshold.
if you don't come soon...
well, let's just say I can't wait much longer.
I don't know if this will ever go away.
this feeling.
I miss you so much.
everything hurts.
there isn't anything I do that isn't about you, somehow.
even opening the refrigerator, I start to ask if you want anything.
and then last night there were dishes in the sink.
and I thought, oh, why can't he just put these in the dishwasher.
God, I love you, Melinda.
I didn't mean to leave.
I never want to be without you.
if you could just get a sign.
if I just knew that you were all right.
if I knew that...
you were at peace somehow, then maybe I could get through all this.
I wish I could.
but I'm here.
I'm with you now.
come on inside. Time to get some sleep.
I would if I could.
I would if I could.
you can't help!
Jim... Is this you? I don't understand.
Mel, no! It's not me! It's this ghost
Melinda, I'm right here. Hear me.
honey, is everything of down there?
Yeah. Everything's fine. Just go back to sleep.
Mel, hear me. Hear me!
nice turn out.
sorry, I'm a little, uh...
I- the thing is... I was going to stand here and talk about loss.
about...
losing a husband, a son, losing a friend.
all of a sudden it feels wrong to talk about loss.
all of a sudden I want to talk about what we gained.
what he leaves us with.
we're not people who've lost.
we're winners.
winners because he was here.
he was with us.
he loved us.
and we loved him.
we're all better for knowing him- each and every single person here.
Where's the loss in that? Listen, um...
I was gonna play this, you know, sad, moving song.
Jim didn't like sad, moving songs.
he liked to rock.
and so should we.
I'm here.
I know.
I just danced at my husband's funeral.
aren't I the merry widow.
another scandal in Grandview.
I couldn't understand why you were staying away.
never. You just couldn't see me through your grief.
it had to lift.
I don't understand the signs you were giving me.
the apple, the dishes, silverware.
it was like, "what, is he hungry?"
is that the only message he has for me from the great beyond?
it wasn't me.
you've got another ghost...
angry teenage girl, I think.
she might be dangerous, Mel.
none of that matters to me anymore.
I am so empty without you.
no, I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere.
you can't stay. You know that. You have to cross over.
Why? - It's the way it is.
it's what happens next.
I don't want to.
I know that.
Mel, I never told you this.
but I don't think I believe in the crossing over part.
not that it doesn't happen.
but does it have to happen?
if you don't believe it, that's like saying that you don't believe in me.
no. Of course I do. I'm just asking you the question.
do you think maybe it's better sometimes that somebody stays?
I know it feels that way.
you think I want you to go?
you think I wouldn't be happy just to stay here and forget about everything else?
look, it's not that I don't want you to have a life.
this is my purpose.
it's what I have this gift for.
for souls to cross over and to take the next step.
and it's what's best for you. So I can't
Hey, no more words.
I just want to be with you now.
here you go. - Thank you.
I can stay, you know.
I'm fine. Really.
I know. Since the wake I feel so much lighter.
it's almost like the ache is gone.
it almost feels like there's something wrong with that.
no, tell her it's what I would have wanted.
you know Jim.
this is what he would want- everyone to be happy.
Yeah. I do believe that.
you won't forget me, will you?
I love you so much. I don't want to lose you, too.
no. You won't. You're my family.
safe travels.
thank you, darling. - Bye.
shouldn't we have told her that you're still here?
no. If we had, she'd never be able to let go.
who are you?
what do you want with my wife?
what do you think you're doing?
I am right here! Can't you see me?
I hate you!
I just want to make you a damn omelet.
what?
do remember what you said about your mom?
that you didn't want her to know that you were here because she wouldn't be able to let go?
you're the one who can't let go.
and you have to.
it's not fair for me to keep you here.
you're not keeping me here, I'm keeping me here!
then it's not fair for me to make you stay.
Melinda, why would we not be together if we can?
because we're not together.
we can't be. Not in the real world.
how about our world?
isn't this better than never seeing each other again?
total, naked truth.
I'd be happy never leaving this house again, if I could be with you.
alive or dead.
but you have a journey to take.
so do I.
we just can't be together right now, that's all.
it's our...
fork in the road. Until we meet again. Over on your side.
my road.
my journey is with you.
it is you.
it's always been that way.
and that was the choice I made. And I'm not...
I cannot let it go just because I'm dead.
there's a sentence you don't hear yourself say every day.
I don't want you to come here anymore.
it just... It hurts us both.
you know, and it's wrong. So if you love me, you'll just...
you'll just do the right thing and cross over.
you don't believe that.
Yes, I do.
please...
don't make this any harder than it already is.
you know what you have to do.
I'll be with you again.
and it won't seem like such a long time, I promise.
Oh, Jim. Please don't do this.
are you kidding me?
I'm off duty, ok? I can't help you.
you have to help him.
who? Jim?
forgive him.
for what? Who are you talking about?
look what I've done to him.
can I just say that no matter what else, messing with people like this is the greatest?
and can I just say my freakin' heart rate hasn't gone below 125 since I met you people?
why would you do that?
I'm sorry, Eli.
I just wanted to see if I could turn on your clock radio.
I mean, there's a big learning curve to this whole ghost thing.
you know, lone ranger look is good on you.
my eyes are sensitive to light, ok?
is the nuclear level really necessary? Seriously.
sorry. I can't do it.
what are you doing here, Jim?
not that I'm not glad to hear you.
but why aren't you with Melinda?
look. Melinda doesn't want to see me ok. She just wants me to cross over.
Seriously?
I thought you guys had the perfect marriage.
you die. She throws you out? That's weird.
Dr. Phil, I don't think I need any advice on my marriage, ok.
I just- I need your help.
how?
there's a ghost haunting Melinda.
it's a toxic ghost.
and I'm afraid she's gonna hurt her.
well, with all due respect, I mean don't you think you're in a little bit better position than I am to deal with a ghost?
I mean, me being alive, and you being...
dead?
I was going to say less alive.
the ghost is afraid of me.
I can't pin her down. Or I don't know, haven't learned how to do that yet.
and I'm worried about Melinda. Because right now, she's more vulnerable than ever.
what kind of ghost? - Ok. A sick one.
she's wears a hospital gown.
she has discolored skin, her hair's falling out.
I think she's a cancer patient.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to work with Melinda and find out who this ghost is and what she wants, ok?
Eli, maybe you can help Melinda re-engage a little bit with real life, ok?
get her mind off me.
in other words, get Melinda to do something she doesn't want to do.
that's always easy.
just tell her I can't cross over- I won't cross over.
until I know this ghost is out of her life. Ok?
I don't want to complain, but I'm starting to tan.
you could use it.
OK.
50/50 shot that whole thing was a dream.
that was no dream.
what if I really want it to be?
why did he keep coming to you?
does he want you to talk me about having him stay?
he's worried about you.
he wants to make sure you're safe before he leaves.
safe? Nobody's safe.
look, I think his heart's in the right place.
I know where Jim's heart is. All right?
and I know he's doing this because he loves me.
and I'm doing what I'm doing because I love him.
it's like O. Henry meets Edgar Allan Poe.
if you want to help Jim, just tell him to cross over.
I want to help you.
I am fine.
no, you're not.
you're angry. You're hurt. You're lost.
just like anybody would be who's going through this.
well, there's nothing I can do about that.
Yes, there is. You can help me find this ghost who's haunting you.
find out what she wants.
I don't care.
then fake it!
you need to do something positive.
something to help this ghost, help Jim, and help you.
tell me what you know about her.
she said I needed to forgive him.
Jim? For what?
I don't know if she was talking about Jim.
she seems really confused.
Jim says he thinks she might be a cancer patient.
Yeah, could be.
OK. So we'll check some hospitals.
Yeah, 'cause a cancer death in Driscoll county, that should be a snap.
it's a start.
look, I know that you're trying to help.
but I can't do this.
I don't want anything to do with ghosts. Ok?
Jim, people have been searching for a way to live forever for a million years.
but it just can't be. It's against nature.
I'm not looking to live forever.
I just can't live without Melinda.
you're not.
but you owe it to her to let her live without you.
Jim, I can't wait any more.
I'm crossing over.
I want to bring you with me, little brother. That's what I've been waiting for.
but I can't force you.
what's it gonna be?
is that dad?
he's been waiting, too.
for both of us.
I can't.
he's not here?
who?
the dead man. - My husband.
no. No, he's not here.
he doesn't want me to talk to you.
he hates me.
is this about Jim?
first, it's about my step-dad.
I hurt him.
hurt him how?
is he still alive?
Yes.
but he doesn't want to be.
look, I-I don't want to seem hard.
but I'm a mess right now.
it's all my fault.
I know how it is to feel guilty. I do.
everything is my fault.
it's because of what I did.
what did you do?
I'm the reason your husband is dead.
what would this ghost have to do with Jim's death?
wouldn't Jim have said something?
unless he doesn't know.
or the ghost is confused or lying.
thanks for narrowing that down.
see, that's why we need you back in the game!
you gotta listen to what this ghost has to say.
I think I scared her off last night.
isn't that irony?
I mean, most ghosts scare the hell out of the living, but you...
focus.
how do we figure out who this ghost is?
you want focus?
how about this- we've been assuming, because of what you and Jim have said,
that the ghost, by the way she looks, is a cancer patient.
but there's another possibility.
Jim said that the ghost had something in her bathrobe. An apple?
Yeah. That she threw at my head.
why would there be an apple, or any food, in a bathrobe?
something she was saving?
or hiding.
hiding because she wanted someone to think she'd eaten it.
I don't get it. - Ok.
yellow skin, decaying teeth, hair loss are all symptoms of anorexia.
my ghost isn't all that thin.
there could be other complications from not eating.
like your heart stopping.
well, that would make more sense given her age and all the guilt that she's feeling.
and if she's local makes it easier to track down 'cause it's more unusual in Grandview.
what did I just do?
come on, say it with me.
narrowed it down.
I'm sorry, Mr. James. The hospital will never give out that information.
actually it's Dr. James.
I don't see an "M. D." on there.
doctor of psychology and philosophy.
and doctor of love in my last year of high school, if you must know.
very impressive. Bye-bye.
Eli, listen.
just get her to bring up the informational on her computer?
are you ok?
Yeah, yeah. I just hate when something I'm not expecting happens.
she just ask her to look at the records. She doesn't have to name names.
I don't know how that's gonna help.
how what's gonna help?
because I can read the name over her shoulder, genius.
can you do me a favor?
can you just look and see if someone specific?
no, not specific! Eli, she can't do that.
and when I say specific i mean anyone, really, in general,
who may have died of anorexia in the last month?
and why would I do that?
because you're doing research at the university on anorexia deaths in the student population.
that's right. - Eli, she can't hear me.
and I'm doing research at the university on anorexia deaths.
and I want to see if there's an upward curve in back-to-school months.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in one of your classes.
there were 2 deaths last month.
one in the hospital, one d. O. A. Does that help?
got it.
it does help. It's very helpful.
if it were up to me, you'd have a little something extra in your envelope this week.
you should walk away now.
Caitlin Mahoney. Her address 15 Keats street. Don't forget that, ok?
got it.
he's in defib.
defib charged to 200.
clear!
resume C. P. R. Give him an amp of epi.
OK. Hold C. P. R. Let's do a rhythm check.
still in asystolic. I'm gonna call it.
time of death 11: 22.
I'll call the wife.
no more pain.
it's hard, isn't it?
what?
being you.
I don't mean, like, right now. I mean, like, every day. Doing what you can do.
I just tried it for, like, 5 minutes, I thought my head was going to explode.
I used to think it was hard.
but i didn't know what "hard" meant.
that's the house.
you know what? I'm really don't feel like doing this.
can you do it? - Me?
I just did the whole hospital-get-a-name-thing. It's your turn.
I understand. I just don't feel like i can face a grieving parent.
what?
Oh, no.
remember me?
Jim, I know that I asked you to stay away.
and you have. But there's really something I need for you to know.
I'm here. It's ok.
Caitlin Mahoney died a month ago from anorexia.
she lived with her stepfather.
her heart gave out before he even had the chance to realize she'd stopped eating.
he was devastated. She was all that he had.
anyway, her step-father went back to work right away, sooner than he should have.
because he didn't know what else to do.
and then something happened at work.
something that almost destroyed him.
what?
where did he work?
the Grandview Police Department.
her step-father is Carl Neely, the detective who shot you.
look, I already told you I'm sorry. I don't blame you for hating me.
I just don't want to talk about any of this anymore, all right?
I feel bad enough as it is.
I don't hate you. No one hates you.
I told you that I would bring someone who could help.
well, I'm glad you didn't.
I've been to the Department Shrinks. I just want to be left alone.
it wasn't your fault, you know.
I shouldn't have been on the job.
I shouldn't have trusted myself pulling my weapon.
I wasn't ready.
I mean Caitlin.
what happened to her. It wasn't your fault.
how'd you know about Caitlin?
she blames herself for what happened.
she wishes she could take it back. But none of us can.
none of us can change the things that happen or what we do.
we just have to accept it. Deal with it. And try not to let it kill us.
she's been here.
watching over you.
what are you telling to me?
what I'm saying is she's seeing what's happening to you.
and it's breaking her heart.
that can't be. It can't be.
it is.
tell him I that I didn't meant to hurt him.
that I was just so stupid, so obsessed.
I just couldn't get thin enough.
she's so sorry.
she never thought about what it would do to you.
I should have seen she was in trouble.
I should have helped her.
I didn't want to believe that something was wrong with her.
I hid it from him.
I thought everybody would love me more if i was thin.
thin and beautiful, like in the magazines.
she thinks what happened that night- with you and Jim- was her fault.
because you were so distracted.
no. No. Not her fault.
I shouldn't have been on duty. She has to know that.
I just wanted her back.
I wanted my girl back.
he was the one person who never judged me.
I totally took him for granted.
she knows that you were always there for her.
even if she didn't realize it.
even when she thought you couldn't see her.
but why? Why would she do that to herself?
maybe she was scared.
so scared that her whole life she would never be truly loved.
not completely.
not for really who she really was.
maybe now she sees that she was loved in that way.
and that it was real.
and once you've had that kind of love, it never goes away.
it just gets stronger.
and it means that she can move on.
and so can you.
I'm sorry I hurt you, daddy.
I love you.
Caity, I always thought you were perfect inside and out.
I wish you could've seen that.
me, too.
Melinda, tell him.
Jim's here, too.
he doesn't blame you.
she's crossing over now.
you coming?
not quite yet.
it wasn't your fault either.
what? - What happened to me.
it wasn't because of what you can do.
then why?
I don't know.
I don't think we can know. Not yet. Not here.
then I don't want to know anything.
it would just be much easier.
Melinda, I love you.
I love you, too.
now you have to go and do the right thing.
I know.
no.
clear!
charging.
still non-responsive.
we lost him.
let's call it. Time of death...
let's get him ready for transport.
Jim, no!
No! No!
Hey, Patrick, get over here!
hang on there, buddy. Just take it easy. Give us a second.
Jim, it's you. You're back.
hold on a second. Take it easy.
do I know you?
No! Jim!
Hey, what is this place?
where am I?
not even a hello for your big brother?
man, I've been waiting here for hours.
hours?
hours, years, who knows. It's all the same.
but I have been waiting for you.
Dan, why are we here?
don't you recognize this place?
dad used to bring you here.
whenever you needed cheering up.
you guys used to fish here, or just dangle your feet off the pier and talk.
we came here when you died.
I know.
I was watching.
now we can go.
go where, Dan?
Duh. Into the light.
I'm supposed to bring you over, that's what I've been waiting for.
the old man told me, "Next time I see you guys, I want to see you together."
dad's there?
I've only seen a glimpse of him.
he also told me I can finally lose the penguin suit when we cross over. So let's go.
Dan, I can't. I have to see Melinda.
Jim, Melinda's gonna be fine.
fine? No, she's not fine. She's a wreck! I have to see her.
I have to talk to her. - She's expecting me. - No, you don't, Jim. Trust me, you don't.
Jim, listen to me!
does Melinda know that you love her?
does everyone you care about know how much you care about them?
Yeah, I think so.
then you're done.
you're ready to cross over.
no.
I can't leave Melinda.
well, do what you gotta do, brother.
that's it. We lost him.
Ned honey, why don't you go and see if there's any recycling that needs to go out, or any mail.
no, it's fine. Don't worry about that stuff.
more tea?
I can't believe I haven't seen him.
he isn't coming to me. It's been 2 days.
maybe...
I don't know. Maybe he crossed over.
Yeah. Yeah, I hope so.
but wouldn't he have said goodbye?
I mean, he wouldn't just leave, would he?
thanks for pointing that out.
haven't you even felt anything?
Mel, I'm here.
like a presence or something? - I'm right here with you.
I haven't seen a ghost since Jim died.
not that I want to.
honey, we have to settle on a date for the funeral.
I can't.
it's too final. I just can't.
Mel, it's not me.
do you see a ghost?
I'm right here.
I don't see anything.
he's here.
no, it's not me! It's not!
Melinda, why can't you see me?
mom.
everyone's so sad.
it sucks, I know.
but you have to believe that they're all going to be all right.
it's not your job to take care of them anymore.
they'll take care of each other now.
Melinda can't see me.
she doesn't even know I'm there.
it's her grief.
it makes the veil stronger.
it blocks her gift because this is so personal for her.
when she finds some joy again, it'll come back.
I can't leave her like this.
she needs closure.
we both do. - Jim, here's the thing.
you're on the threshold.
if you don't come soon...
well, let's just say I can't wait much longer.
I don't know if this will ever go away.
this feeling.
I miss you so much.
everything hurts.
there isn't anything I do that isn't about you, somehow.
even opening the refrigerator, I start to ask if you want anything.
and then last night there were dishes in the sink.
and I thought, oh, why can't he just put these in the dishwasher.
God, I love you, Melinda.
I didn't mean to leave.
I never want to be without you.
if you could just get a sign.
if I just knew that you were all right.
if I knew that...
you were at peace somehow, then maybe I could get through all this.
I wish I could.
but I'm here.
I'm with you now.
come on inside. Time to get some sleep.
I would if I could.
I would if I could.
you can't help!
Jim... Is this you? I don't understand.
Mel, no! It's not me! It's this ghost
Melinda, I'm right here. Hear me.
honey, is everything of down there?
Yeah. Everything's fine. Just go back to sleep.
Mel, hear me. Hear me!
nice turn out.
sorry, I'm a little, uh...
I- the thing is... I was going to stand here and talk about loss.
about...
losing a husband, a son, losing a friend.
all of a sudden it feels wrong to talk about loss.
all of a sudden I want to talk about what we gained.
what he leaves us with.
we're not people who've lost.
we're winners.
winners because he was here.
he was with us.
he loved us.
and we loved him.
we're all better for knowing him- each and every single person here.
Where's the loss in that? Listen, um...
I was gonna play this, you know, sad, moving song.
Jim didn't like sad, moving songs.
he liked to rock.
and so should we.
I'm here.
I know.
I just danced at my husband's funeral.
aren't I the merry widow.
another scandal in Grandview.
I couldn't understand why you were staying away.
never. You just couldn't see me through your grief.
it had to lift.
I don't understand the signs you were giving me.
the apple, the dishes, silverware.
it was like, "what, is he hungry?"
is that the only message he has for me from the great beyond?
it wasn't me.
you've got another ghost...
angry teenage girl, I think.
she might be dangerous, Mel.
none of that matters to me anymore.
I am so empty without you.
no, I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere.
you can't stay. You know that. You have to cross over.
Why? - It's the way it is.
it's what happens next.
I don't want to.
I know that.
Mel, I never told you this.
but I don't think I believe in the crossing over part.
not that it doesn't happen.
but does it have to happen?
if you don't believe it, that's like saying that you don't believe in me.
no. Of course I do. I'm just asking you the question.
do you think maybe it's better sometimes that somebody stays?
I know it feels that way.
you think I want you to go?
you think I wouldn't be happy just to stay here and forget about everything else?
look, it's not that I don't want you to have a life.
this is my purpose.
it's what I have this gift for.
for souls to cross over and to take the next step.
and it's what's best for you. So I can't
Hey, no more words.
I just want to be with you now.
here you go. - Thank you.
I can stay, you know.
I'm fine. Really.
I know. Since the wake I feel so much lighter.
it's almost like the ache is gone.
it almost feels like there's something wrong with that.
no, tell her it's what I would have wanted.
you know Jim.
this is what he would want- everyone to be happy.
Yeah. I do believe that.
you won't forget me, will you?
I love you so much. I don't want to lose you, too.
no. You won't. You're my family.
safe travels.
thank you, darling. - Bye.
shouldn't we have told her that you're still here?
no. If we had, she'd never be able to let go.
who are you?
what do you want with my wife?
what do you think you're doing?
I am right here! Can't you see me?
I hate you!
I just want to make you a damn omelet.
what?
do remember what you said about your mom?
that you didn't want her to know that you were here because she wouldn't be able to let go?
you're the one who can't let go.
and you have to.
it's not fair for me to keep you here.
you're not keeping me here, I'm keeping me here!
then it's not fair for me to make you stay.
Melinda, why would we not be together if we can?
because we're not together.
we can't be. Not in the real world.
how about our world?
isn't this better than never seeing each other again?
total, naked truth.
I'd be happy never leaving this house again, if I could be with you.
alive or dead.
but you have a journey to take.
so do I.
we just can't be together right now, that's all.
it's our...
fork in the road. Until we meet again. Over on your side.
my road.
my journey is with you.
it is you.
it's always been that way.
and that was the choice I made. And I'm not...
I cannot let it go just because I'm dead.
there's a sentence you don't hear yourself say every day.
I don't want you to come here anymore.
it just... It hurts us both.
you know, and it's wrong. So if you love me, you'll just...
you'll just do the right thing and cross over.
you don't believe that.
Yes, I do.
please...
don't make this any harder than it already is.
you know what you have to do.
I'll be with you again.
and it won't seem like such a long time, I promise.
Oh, Jim. Please don't do this.
are you kidding me?
I'm off duty, ok? I can't help you.
you have to help him.
who? Jim?
forgive him.
for what? Who are you talking about?
look what I've done to him.
can I just say that no matter what else, messing with people like this is the greatest?
and can I just say my freakin' heart rate hasn't gone below 125 since I met you people?
why would you do that?
I'm sorry, Eli.
I just wanted to see if I could turn on your clock radio.
I mean, there's a big learning curve to this whole ghost thing.
you know, lone ranger look is good on you.
my eyes are sensitive to light, ok?
is the nuclear level really necessary? Seriously.
sorry. I can't do it.
what are you doing here, Jim?
not that I'm not glad to hear you.
but why aren't you with Melinda?
look. Melinda doesn't want to see me ok. She just wants me to cross over.
Seriously?
I thought you guys had the perfect marriage.
you die. She throws you out? That's weird.
Dr. Phil, I don't think I need any advice on my marriage, ok.
I just- I need your help.
how?
there's a ghost haunting Melinda.
it's a toxic ghost.
and I'm afraid she's gonna hurt her.
well, with all due respect, I mean don't you think you're in a little bit better position than I am to deal with a ghost?
I mean, me being alive, and you being...
dead?
I was going to say less alive.
the ghost is afraid of me.
I can't pin her down. Or I don't know, haven't learned how to do that yet.
and I'm worried about Melinda. Because right now, she's more vulnerable than ever.
what kind of ghost? - Ok. A sick one.
she's wears a hospital gown.
she has discolored skin, her hair's falling out.
I think she's a cancer patient.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to work with Melinda and find out who this ghost is and what she wants, ok?
Eli, maybe you can help Melinda re-engage a little bit with real life, ok?
get her mind off me.
in other words, get Melinda to do something she doesn't want to do.
that's always easy.
just tell her I can't cross over- I won't cross over.
until I know this ghost is out of her life. Ok?
I don't want to complain, but I'm starting to tan.
you could use it.
OK.
50/50 shot that whole thing was a dream.
that was no dream.
what if I really want it to be?
why did he keep coming to you?
does he want you to talk me about having him stay?
he's worried about you.
he wants to make sure you're safe before he leaves.
safe? Nobody's safe.
look, I think his heart's in the right place.
I know where Jim's heart is. All right?
and I know he's doing this because he loves me.
and I'm doing what I'm doing because I love him.
it's like O. Henry meets Edgar Allan Poe.
if you want to help Jim, just tell him to cross over.
I want to help you.
I am fine.
no, you're not.
you're angry. You're hurt. You're lost.
just like anybody would be who's going through this.
well, there's nothing I can do about that.
Yes, there is. You can help me find this ghost who's haunting you.
find out what she wants.
I don't care.
then fake it!
you need to do something positive.
something to help this ghost, help Jim, and help you.
tell me what you know about her.
she said I needed to forgive him.
Jim? For what?
I don't know if she was talking about Jim.
she seems really confused.
Jim says he thinks she might be a cancer patient.
Yeah, could be.
OK. So we'll check some hospitals.
Yeah, 'cause a cancer death in Driscoll county, that should be a snap.
it's a start.
look, I know that you're trying to help.
but I can't do this.
I don't want anything to do with ghosts. Ok?
Jim, people have been searching for a way to live forever for a million years.
but it just can't be. It's against nature.
I'm not looking to live forever.
I just can't live without Melinda.
you're not.
but you owe it to her to let her live without you.
Jim, I can't wait any more.
I'm crossing over.
I want to bring you with me, little brother. That's what I've been waiting for.
but I can't force you.
what's it gonna be?
is that dad?
he's been waiting, too.
for both of us.
I can't.
he's not here?
who?
the dead man. - My husband.
no. No, he's not here.
he doesn't want me to talk to you.
he hates me.
is this about Jim?
first, it's about my step-dad.
I hurt him.
hurt him how?
is he still alive?
Yes.
but he doesn't want to be.
look, I-I don't want to seem hard.
but I'm a mess right now.
it's all my fault.
I know how it is to feel guilty. I do.
everything is my fault.
it's because of what I did.
what did you do?
I'm the reason your husband is dead.
what would this ghost have to do with Jim's death?
wouldn't Jim have said something?
unless he doesn't know.
or the ghost is confused or lying.
thanks for narrowing that down.
see, that's why we need you back in the game!
you gotta listen to what this ghost has to say.
I think I scared her off last night.
isn't that irony?
I mean, most ghosts scare the hell out of the living, but you...
focus.
how do we figure out who this ghost is?
you want focus?
how about this- we've been assuming, because of what you and Jim have said,
that the ghost, by the way she looks, is a cancer patient.
but there's another possibility.
Jim said that the ghost had something in her bathrobe. An apple?
Yeah. That she threw at my head.
why would there be an apple, or any food, in a bathrobe?
something she was saving?
or hiding.
hiding because she wanted someone to think she'd eaten it.
I don't get it. - Ok.
yellow skin, decaying teeth, hair loss are all symptoms of anorexia.
my ghost isn't all that thin.
there could be other complications from not eating.
like your heart stopping.
well, that would make more sense given her age and all the guilt that she's feeling.
and if she's local makes it easier to track down 'cause it's more unusual in Grandview.
what did I just do?
come on, say it with me.
narrowed it down.
I'm sorry, Mr. James. The hospital will never give out that information.
actually it's Dr. James.
I don't see an "M. D." on there.
doctor of psychology and philosophy.
and doctor of love in my last year of high school, if you must know.
very impressive. Bye-bye.
Eli, listen.
just get her to bring up the informational on her computer?
are you ok?
Yeah, yeah. I just hate when something I'm not expecting happens.
she just ask her to look at the records. She doesn't have to name names.
I don't know how that's gonna help.
how what's gonna help?
because I can read the name over her shoulder, genius.
can you do me a favor?
can you just look and see if someone specific?
no, not specific! Eli, she can't do that.
and when I say specific i mean anyone, really, in general,
who may have died of anorexia in the last month?
and why would I do that?
because you're doing research at the university on anorexia deaths in the student population.
that's right. - Eli, she can't hear me.
and I'm doing research at the university on anorexia deaths.
and I want to see if there's an upward curve in back-to-school months.
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in one of your classes.
there were 2 deaths last month.
one in the hospital, one d. O. A. Does that help?
got it.
it does help. It's very helpful.
if it were up to me, you'd have a little something extra in your envelope this week.
you should walk away now.
Caitlin Mahoney. Her address 15 Keats street. Don't forget that, ok?
got it.
he's in defib.
defib charged to 200.
clear!
resume C. P. R. Give him an amp of epi.
OK. Hold C. P. R. Let's do a rhythm check.
still in asystolic. I'm gonna call it.
time of death 11: 22.
I'll call the wife.
no more pain.
it's hard, isn't it?
what?
being you.
I don't mean, like, right now. I mean, like, every day. Doing what you can do.
I just tried it for, like, 5 minutes, I thought my head was going to explode.
I used to think it was hard.
but i didn't know what "hard" meant.
that's the house.
you know what? I'm really don't feel like doing this.
can you do it? - Me?
I just did the whole hospital-get-a-name-thing. It's your turn.
I understand. I just don't feel like i can face a grieving parent.
what?
Oh, no.
remember me?
Jim, I know that I asked you to stay away.
and you have. But there's really something I need for you to know.
I'm here. It's ok.
Caitlin Mahoney died a month ago from anorexia.
she lived with her stepfather.
her heart gave out before he even had the chance to realize she'd stopped eating.
he was devastated. She was all that he had.
anyway, her step-father went back to work right away, sooner than he should have.
because he didn't know what else to do.
and then something happened at work.
something that almost destroyed him.
what?
where did he work?
the Grandview Police Department.
her step-father is Carl Neely, the detective who shot you.
look, I already told you I'm sorry. I don't blame you for hating me.
I just don't want to talk about any of this anymore, all right?
I feel bad enough as it is.
I don't hate you. No one hates you.
I told you that I would bring someone who could help.
well, I'm glad you didn't.
I've been to the Department Shrinks. I just want to be left alone.
it wasn't your fault, you know.
I shouldn't have been on the job.
I shouldn't have trusted myself pulling my weapon.
I wasn't ready.
I mean Caitlin.
what happened to her. It wasn't your fault.
how'd you know about Caitlin?
she blames herself for what happened.
she wishes she could take it back. But none of us can.
none of us can change the things that happen or what we do.
we just have to accept it. Deal with it. And try not to let it kill us.
she's been here.
watching over you.
what are you telling to me?
what I'm saying is she's seeing what's happening to you.
and it's breaking her heart.
that can't be. It can't be.
it is.
tell him I that I didn't meant to hurt him.
that I was just so stupid, so obsessed.
I just couldn't get thin enough.
she's so sorry.
she never thought about what it would do to you.
I should have seen she was in trouble.
I should have helped her.
I didn't want to believe that something was wrong with her.
I hid it from him.
I thought everybody would love me more if i was thin.
thin and beautiful, like in the magazines.
she thinks what happened that night- with you and Jim- was her fault.
because you were so distracted.
no. No. Not her fault.
I shouldn't have been on duty. She has to know that.
I just wanted her back.
I wanted my girl back.
he was the one person who never judged me.
I totally took him for granted.
she knows that you were always there for her.
even if she didn't realize it.
even when she thought you couldn't see her.
but why? Why would she do that to herself?
maybe she was scared.
so scared that her whole life she would never be truly loved.
not completely.
not for really who she really was.
maybe now she sees that she was loved in that way.
and that it was real.
and once you've had that kind of love, it never goes away.
it just gets stronger.
and it means that she can move on.
and so can you.
I'm sorry I hurt you, daddy.
I love you.
Caity, I always thought you were perfect inside and out.
I wish you could've seen that.
me, too.
Melinda, tell him.
Jim's here, too.
he doesn't blame you.
she's crossing over now.
you coming?
not quite yet.
it wasn't your fault either.
what? - What happened to me.
it wasn't because of what you can do.
then why?
I don't know.
I don't think we can know. Not yet. Not here.
then I don't want to know anything.
it would just be much easier.
Melinda, I love you.
I love you, too.
now you have to go and do the right thing.
I know.
no.
clear!
charging.
still non-responsive.
we lost him.
let's call it. Time of death...
let's get him ready for transport.
Jim, no!
No! No!
Hey, Patrick, get over here!
hang on there, buddy. Just take it easy. Give us a second.
Jim, it's you. You're back.
hold on a second. Take it easy.
do I know you?
you move between the world of life and death.
you don't know the price.
what price?
No! Please, not you!
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
you're back!
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
he's in there somewhere.
he just has to be.
you're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
because you are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much. But maybe you could help me finish my garage.
and you could live there while you do the work.
just until you figure out your next move.
that's strange. I've been hoping for a clue.
something to tell me who I was.
I bought that less than a month ago.
question is, who did I buy it for?
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?
you must be Nicole.
the fiance?
she is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.
OK. So where are they now?
I don't know. He hasn't been home all day.
but he's with her? Nikki.
I assume so.
how much time are they actually spending together?
well, he's not working, and she's in town. So...
you didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.
what about the nights? Is she still staying at the hotel?
Yes.
but they're spending all day together.
I'm really trying not to think about it.
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her
so that he could explain to her what happened and then say goodbye.
well, guess what. They're saying hello.
I think I hear them.
no. No. No. They're just gonna see you.
Oh, yeah. That's a lot better.
did she see me?
can I?
no. - Hold on a second, Sam.
uh, Melinda?
this is nuts - Hi. I am Delia.
Hi, Delia. I'm Nikki.
I was looking for Melinda.
found it! - Oh, gosh!
Nikki, Delia. Have you met Delia?
Yes. We did.
I found it. - Oh, great.
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.
no. It's great.
Hey, Melinda.
Hi, Sam.
uh, Nikki left her cell phone here. So...
right. So...
I guess I'll be taking you back...
well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.
it's fine and everything.
but I'm actually going to be spending a little bit more time than I originally planned.
and I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.
but I was only able to get a week off from work.
and I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.
so, you are here. And just if you didn't mind?
mind?
just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.
obviously.
no. No.
because we're really just getting to know each other.
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Really? It's ok. I can stay with you?
sure.
great. - Great.
great.
we were walking around the house into the back.
and we get there.
and her grandmother and grandfather are there.
Oh, my god!
what are you doing?
swimming.
are you crazy? What are you thinking?
Paula, come on, it's freezing! - No way!
she's going in.
no. - Catch me if you can!
Paula, don't go out there.
Oh, my God! This is no！
is she serious?
I'm not going in there, no way!
Paula, come back!
mark, do something.
Paula, come on! Wait!
Paula, come on! It's freezing.
seriously, come on!
Paula, come on, it's freezing.
where is she?
mark, look down.
fish, oh, gross. - Oh, sick.
Paula, come back, ok?
very funny, we get it- Just come back, seriously.
come on.
come on, guys. The water's great.
come on, Paula. - All right, let's go.
Paula, come back.
Yeah, Paula. It's not funny. Seriously.
what was that?
Oh, my god. I think there's...
Paula, look, I'm worried! Paula! Hold that.
she's not kidding, get her out of there!
Oh, my god, what's going on?
get her out of there!
I think something's in there! What is that?!
what's the matter?! Hurry! Oh, my god!
swim this way, come on! Mark, get her!
Oh, my god.
hurry, hurry, get out! What the hell was that?
here, give me your coat. - Here, put this on.
Hey, it's ok. You're ok now.
just get me out of here.
OK, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?
getting your mind off the fact that your husband's dating your roomie.
she is not my roomie. Ok?
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.
you're literally the girl that can't say no.
should've made you very popular in high school.
Hey! I can say "no."
then what are you doing up here with me?
you said you needed a favor.
and I need a favor, too. Ok?
just please keep working with Sam...
no matter what it takes to get his memory back before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.
just please help us.
of course. I'll do whatever I can.
but now my favor.
EW. Do you smell that?
dead fish everywhere.
a biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.
but I thought you might get results faster.
me?
a student of mine was up here swimming with some friends last night.
the whole experience freaked her out.
and not just the dead fish.
she said something was pulling her under.
she called it a presence.
look, I know it's a long shot, but her father died earlier this year...
what was his name?
he's here.
but do you hear that?
he's not alone.
tell no one.
ghost WHISPERER
you're sure that's the ghost you saw?
I think so. He responded to his name, anyway.
according to his obituary, he was 52.
died of a stroke.
well, that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.
how they looked at the moment of their death, or how they looked in life.
half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.
sometimes spirits gather. I've seen it before.
but it's usually around the place of their death.
so this is where they all died?
you'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.
do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?
Yeah. But that was almost 20 miles away.
so what are they doing there?
keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."
not a lot of subtext there.
unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.
it's the biologist I told you about from the university.
he found heavy concentrations of a particular pathogen in the water.
so they're actually in there?
we'll know soon enough.
health department's gonna dredge the lake.
Oh! That's my appointment with Sam.
well, go! Go. Get out of here.
what?
no, but I want it back. Give it back!
you gave it to me. - I did not give it to you.
give it.
well, here look. If you want it so badly.
well, I just wanted to show you the article.
you always do this.
Hey, Eli.
Hey.
this is Nikki.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.
OK. Buddy. Take care.
well, listen. Thank you so much for helping us out.
Oh, sure. Um...
is this going to be a joint session?
no, it's just me. But we were running so late,
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...
it's fine. Don't worry about it. Not a problem.
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.
thank you.
past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.
with all due respect,
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life.
is going to help me find this one.
all right. The one that I lost.
it loosens the subconscious.
my subconscious?
do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?
it is telling me that something off.
good, that's good. Keep going.
well, Nikki for example. Ok?
she's beautiful. She's smart. She's blonde?
blonde? You're into blondes?
no. That she has nice hair.
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.
I mean, I remember how it smelled.
well, then why can't I remember at all jerking her around for 10 years?
maybe you just didn't want to marry her.
OK. So I was Mr. Can't Commit.
that's what everyone says.
you know what I think?
I think I remember wanting to get married.
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...
tell me about her.
well, that we wanted to have kids.
I mean, maybe we were even trying.
if that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?
by she you mean?
Nikki. Who else?
you tell me.
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.
I want you to consider that maybe.
just maybe...
there's someone else.
wait, someone more important than the woman I spent half my adult life with?
look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.
look, I...I really gotta talk to her.
but thanks. This has been a big help.
did they find anything?
Yeah. Plenty.
a reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.
victims? Is that what they are?
Paula's father died in a hospital.
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.
maybe the paper got it wrong.
anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.
I don't hear anything.
they're here.
so how'd it go with Sam? - So-so.
as his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.
what I almost told him.
which was?
that he's Jim, your husband.
and anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.
so he remembered something?
just that he wanted to have kids. - Well, that's huge!
he thinks he wants to have them with her.
what am I going to do?
you've disturbed us. All of us.
all we asked for was your silence.
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.
it's the health department and the police.
they want answers.
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.
they deserve to find out what happened to you.
just tell us how we can help.
what is it that you want...
to protect the living.
from what?
got another one.
what if they just all died of the same thing?
some chemical, toxic-something?
in the lake?
I think the C. D. C. would say that the dead people are the problem.
and bothers me is not how they got there, but why they stayed.
your Latte, and the cappuccino. - Thanks.
well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?
Yeah. That's the upside.
that's an upside?
you know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured there by someone or something.
what do you mean? Like some kinda ghost cult?
no. More like the ghosts in the tunnels, you know, or the watchers.
the watchers?
a group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.
they said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.
Ahh. There's Sam.
and no Nikki. And he's heading toward the store.
go. Go be with him.
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.
go!
all right. Ok.
Hey, Melinda. That's funny.
I was just coming to see you.
do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?
no. I'm good. - Great.
thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.
Oh, yeah. It's no problem.
I didn't even see her last night.
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.
and she was asleep when I left. So.
Yeah. She's a night person.
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.
I guess both of us were.
she'd do crosswords. I would read the sports pages.
we'd stay up... I hate crosswords.
I don't even remember.
although, you know it's funny.
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average...
wait. How do you know that?
you hear something enough times it kinda sticks.
look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,
how is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia.
but I don't remember something that Nikki and I fought about for years?
in my head I remember wanting to have kids.
and Nikki didn't?
no, she says she did.
so this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.
and she's gotta be right.
I mean, she sounds right.
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.
not all guys are like that.
my husband wasn't.
I was always the one dragging my heels.
but Jim, he...
he wanted everything that you're remembering...
which has to mean something, right?
what to me and Nikki?
no, to you.
it's none of my business.
but maybe you...maybe you shouldn't listen to what everyone else says, not about the stuff that really matters.
you know who you are.
when you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...
to what? To being the guy like your husband?
committed, confident enough in himself.
in the world, to bring another human being into it?
but you see, I wasn't.
so pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.
thank you so much for coming.
of course, you seemed upset.
I don't understand.
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,
and then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.
and then I turn on the TV and see them pulling dead bodies out of water that I was just swimming in.
I know this must be scary...
it's disgusting.
I wish I could make you feel better.
but unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.
what are you talking about?
I need to ask you about your father.
first I need you to consider the possibility that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.
Why?
because I've talked to your father's ghost.
he was up at the lake.
he's there...
no, this is...this is crazy.
Paula, you said you felt a presence,
you think my dad is one of the corpses they're pulling out of that water?
look, I know this is hard to accept...
no, literally. There's no way.
Why?
he's right here.
your father was cremated...where?
is this what you wanted? To be cremated?
I was done with my body.
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.
and now they have to feel your loss all over again.
protect the living.
you meant, from what happened to you.
we were betrayed.
look what's become of us.
it's just how you see yourselves.
no. It's how they'll see us too.
my wife, my daughter.
they'll be forced to...
no. No. You can talk to them.
you can help them through this.
and they'll remember you just as you were.
and then you can move on.
we're not going anywhere.
we've waited.
there's business to finish.
what is it that you want to finish?
you mean who.
if they went to the movies they should been back by now.
or if they went to dinner...
I don't know where they are.
and I don't want to know.
well, you should want to know
when your competition looks like this.
it's tough love, girlfriend. And you gotta hear this.
OK. So what do you want me to do?
get into the game!
you gotta fight fire with fire!
look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy.
well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
does it look like I'm doing nothing?
no, it looks like you're helping another ghost.
not just one ghost, a lot of them.
OK, and they left loved ones behind.
and if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.
I'm not so sure Sam can.
Yeah. Neither am I.
then why don't you do something about it?
because nothing...
nothing I can do will get him to remember me...
or choose me.
all I can do is having faith.
that's all I have right now.
faith.
it's so nice to meet you.
Carl gets so few visitors lately.
not that we're surprised in his business.
who wants to watch someone dying?
when did he close the funeral home?
when the cancer made it impossible for him to work.
did he take care of your family?
no. He...helped some friends of mine.
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.
he doesn't listen to me anymore.
get through to him?
he has so little time, and he's in such pain...
but he won't take the pills they give him.
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.
but really, why go on like this?
do you want me to talk to him?
thank you.
come on.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I don't know you.
what do you want?
I came to talk about the lake.
what lake?
where the bodies are.
where you put them. Didn't you?
part of me hoped I would die before this day.
and the other part?
what if they're waiting for me?
why did you do it?
I thought I had no choice.
what do you mean?
the big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.
but my great grandfather built that place from nothing.
and I was proud.
and I wanted a better price.
what happened?
what always happens.
they undercut me. I couldn't compete. The money ran out.
and when the furnace finally broke down,
I was desperate.
it's no excuse.
sometimes I think...
the cancer is a punishment.
all this pain.
your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.
I feel evil.
Carl, you made a mistake. You're not evil.
no. No. I feel evil around me.
everywhere.
you're right. Carl, they're here.
all the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.
Oh, no.
I see them.
Oh, please.
they're angry because of what you did. But I can help.
please just give me the names of all the people that you threw into the lake.
I can talk to their families. I can help them heal.
to help them suffer, you mean.
then they'll drop their anger, ok?
not until he's suffered like we have.
you need to go into the light.
there's forgiveness there.
Carl, take your medicine.
I went back and looked where he told me to.
back to the funeral home?
wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.
yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.
formaldehyde girl, that's funny.
sorry. Not funny.
did you get the list of names?
Yeah. I'm just trying to see if their I. D.s match what we found.
Hey, here's Paula's dad.
was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?
cremation, cremation.
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...
cremated. I'll call you back.
how are you?
I'm fine.
um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?
sure. What about him?
well, first of all, I want to apologize for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.
but I really...honestly,
I didn't know who else to go to.
you know how you grow up imagining what it'll be like to be in love?
you picture your boyfriend, your husband.
and not just the good times...
but the fights and the problems, too.
Yeah. Sure.
could you ever have imagined something like this happening?
a guy that you loved just wakes up one day and then suddenly has no idea who you are?
no. Never.
Really? Not at all?
I...I don't understand.
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...
do you think it's a little odd that he's staying in your garage?
the same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?
and where are the plans? I haven't seen any of those.
what are you driving at?
when I first came here, my idea was a quick in and out.
let Sam know that he was forgiven, maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.
but now that I've seen who he is,
I...I don't want to let him go.
what does that have to do with me?
that's what I'm trying to find out.
shouldn't you be asking Sam?
you're not gonna make this easy, are you?
I thought I just did.
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.
I apologize for coming by without calling.
I thought you'd want to know.
Carl died, a few hours ago.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what you said, but after you left, he seemed to change.
he relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.
after a few hours later, he took my hand.
then his eyes opened wide, like he saw something amazing.
and that was it.
that look in his eyes, he must have just seen the face of his maker.
don't you think?
that's a lovely notion.
thank you so much, Melinda, for giving my husband peace.
how did I get here?
Oh, no! No. Melinda!
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.
for you, there's nowhere but here.
forgive me.
please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you for forgiveness.
please! Please!
that's not what you'll find here.
help me!
mom, you wanted to talk about this.
no one is mad at you, Mom.
speak for yourself.
when Edwin had his stroke, he was jogging a few miles from home.
he had no wallet, no ID.
so the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.
I went.
but I couldn't do it.
I just...I couldn't look at him.
Paula was there by then, so she did it.
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.
mom, I didn't mind doing it.
there was no shame in what happened to him.
why couldn't I just look at him?
marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.
most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.
my daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.
he is stuck here? He can't move on?
that's right.
he and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,
they're earthbound, which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.
why not?
they don't want you to know what happened to them.
out of shame.
that's why your husband tried to scare Paula away - that night at the lake. - Can we help them?
you might.
but right now, they're very angry.
until the right moment comes...
if Edwin's ghost is still here, then that means he saw what I did when he died.
please give me the chance to make it right.
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!
sorry.
I'm sorry. The door was open.
look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.
and, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.
I'm fine.
are you sure? Because you seemed a little tense, and frankly, so did Nikki.
no, really. I'm fine.
OK.
well, then I'll go back to the hotel.
Why?
I mean, she's been here almost a week, so what are you going to do?
I don't know. It's weird.
I feel things when I'm with her.
nice things.
her smell is familiar.
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.
you know, it's comfortable.
OK.
Melinda, not everybody can have what you had with your husband.
all right? And given my track record,
I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.
of course you are.
maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
and, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance, you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.
maybe that's a good thing.
maybe I should reach out with both hands.
all right.
don't.
don't what?
you can do better for yourself than "comfortable"
or "maybe getting some feelings back."
hold out for more.
what?
what am I holding out for?
everything.
hold out for everything.
you know, that's easy for you to say.
you had everything.
who's there?
Carl, why are you here?
you said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.
did you look into the light?
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.
why not?
because of my shame.
but you apologized.
I mean, you tried to make things right.
you can come out of the shadows now.
no, I can't. They're looking for me.
they want me to go with them.
those spirits are angry because of what you did.
nobody can keep you from the light.
it's not them. It's the others.
the others? - Spirits I've never seen before.
but they said they know you.
they know me?
they said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,
and something you cherished was lost.
And?
they said you believed in things that weren't right,
and trusting those things might hurt others...
and you.
Hello?
I'm here.
what do you want from me?
what did I do to offend you?
you did nothing.
then why did you take my husband away?
fate did that, not us.
you came to me and you said
that death would touch something that I loved.
and before I knew it, he was dead.
we just warned you to be careful.
Yeah. 'cause that's what you were doing was warning me
with all your lies and threats.
we don't lie or make threats.
you told Carl that he couldn't cross over.
the light has never denied anyone.
the light doesn't make the choice.
we each do.
we? You mean you.
no, each of us for ourselves.
you wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.
well, it's the same reason that Carl did.
when the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.
so Carl's shame kept him here.
when spirits feel unworthy, sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.
to make ourselves worthy.
what spirits stay back to do that?
I haven't seen any.
you're meeting four of them now.
you?
why do you think we're still here?
so when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?
they explained it to me, and I understand now.
this is what I want.
are you sure?
because they said it's your choice.
you can move on now.
I want to be one of them.
all right.
will you help me fix the wrongs I did?
how?
by taking away their shame.
thank you all for coming tonight.
we'd asked for family and friends,
and I just never realized how many friends we have.
Hey, Eli. - Hi, Sam.
I wasn't sure what to say,
so I asked my darling English major Paula for some help.
and she wrote down some thoughts for me.
Paula? Don't be shy.
tonight we send our loved ones "to where we thought they'd already gone."
it seems like a detour, "an embarrassing wrong turn."
but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.
we pretended we did, and that made us feel better.
but every path leads to the unknown.
some paths join others, and some split off on their own.
we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.
maybe the more we insist on knowing, "the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns."
I know what you're thinking, "that the unknown is scary."
but that's ok.
we're human.
maybe before we feel free, "we're supposed to feel fearful."
maybe it means more that way.
so let's all say goodbye now.
and remember, that no matter what we're feeling, "there's no shame."
no shame at all.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Nikki's downstairs.
she wanted to talk to you first.
first?
heh, I...I don't know why you've been so nice to me.
letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...
it's not easy to say this,
we have our whole lives ahead of us.
and whatever you're feeling right now,
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.
someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.
you don't have to...
the weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.
he's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.
he talks about holding out.
and that's sort of amazing, because everything I've been holding out for,
he is ready to give.
and I don't know why, but I feel like I have to thank you for that.
no hard feelings, I hope.
you...you deserve every happiness.
thank you.
thank you.
thanks for coming.
please, uh...
just be happy.
Bye.
Bye.
you move between the world of life and death.
you don't know the price.
what price?
No! Please, not you!
you have to cross over.
I don't want to.
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body.
you're back!
do I know you?
I see the same guy that you see,
different hair, nose, eyes. It's not Jim.
he's in there somewhere.
he just has to be.
you're not gonna tell me that you think I'm your husband reincarnated.
because you are the only sane person I've met since I woke up.
it's not much. But maybe you could help me finish my garage.
and you could live there while you do the work.
just until you figure out your next move.
that's strange. I've been hoping for a clue.
something to tell me who I was.
I bought that less than a month ago.
question is, who did I buy it for?
Oh, my god. It's true. You don't know who I am, do you?
you must be Nicole.
the fiance? -She is not his fiance until he puts a ring on her finger.
OK. So where are they now?
I don't know. He hasn't been home all day.
but he's with her? Nikki.
I assume so.
how much time are they actually spending together?
well, he's not working, and she's in town. So...
you didn't tell me they were spending whole days together.
what about the nights? Is she still staying at the hotel?
Yes.
but they're spending all day together.
I'm really trying not to think about it.
I thought he was just trying to get in touch with her
so that he could explain to her what happened and then say goodbye.
well, guess what. They're saying hello.
I think I hear them.
no. No. No. They're just gonna see you.
Oh, yeah. That's a lot better.
did she see me?
can I?
no. - Hold on a second, Sam.
uh, Melinda?
this is nuts. Hi. I am Delia.
Hi, Delia. I'm Nikki. I was looking for Melinda.
found it! -Oh, gosh!
Nikki, Delia. Have you met Delia?
Yes. We did.
I found it. - Oh, great.
I'm so sorry we had to come all the way back here for just this.
no. It's great.
Hey, Melinda.
Hi, Sam.
uh, Nikki left her cell phone here. So...
right. So...
I guess I'll be taking you back...
well, actually that's why I wanted talk to you.
Melinda, the hotel that I booked is really nice.
it's fine and everything.
but I'm actually going to be spending a little bit more time than I originally planned.
and I really want to help Sam out as much as possible.
but I was only able to get a week off from work.
and I don't want to waste a minute that I could spend with him.
so, you are here. And just if you didn't mind?
mind?
just 'cause obviously I couldn't stay with Sam.
obviously.
no. No.
because we're really just getting to know each other.
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Really? It's ok. I can stay with you?
sure.
great. - Great.
great.
we were walking around the house into the back.
and we get there.
and her grandmother and grandfather are there.
Oh, my god!
what are you doing?
swimming.
are you crazy? What are you thinking?
Paula, come on, it's freezing! -No way!
she's going in.
no. - Catch me if you can!
Paula, don't go out there.
Oh, my God! This is no！
is she serious? -I'm not going in there, no way!
Paula, come back!
mark, do something.
Paula, come on! Wait!
Paula, come on! It's freezing.
seriously, come on!
Paula, come on, it's freezing.
where is she?
mark, look down.
fish, oh, gross. - Oh, sick.
Paula, come back, ok?
very funny, we get it. Just come back, seriously.
come on.
come on, guys. The water's great.
come on, Paula. - All right, let's go.
Paula, come back.
Yeah, Paula. It's not funny. Seriously.
what was that?
Oh, my god. I think there's...
Oh, my god!
Hey, it's ok. You're ok now.
just get me out of here.
OK, I enjoy hiking like the next girl but why are we out here?
getting your mind off the fact that your husband's dating your roomie.
she is not my roomie. Ok?
I was in such a fog, I didn't know what I said yes to.
you're literally the girl that can't say no.
should've made you very popular in high school.
Hey! I can say "no."
then what are you doing up here with me?
you said you needed a favor.
and I need a favor, too. Ok?
just please keep working with Sam...
no matter what it takes to get his memory back...
before Nikki convinces him that he loves her.
just please help us.
of course. I'll do whatever I can.
but now my favor.
EW. Do you smell that?
dead fish everywhere.
a biologist at the university's doing some tests in the water.
but I thought you might get results faster.
me?
a student of mine was up here swimming with some friends last night.
the whole experience freaked her out.
and not just the dead fish.
she said something was pulling her under.
she called it a presence.
look, I know it's a long shot, but her father died earlier this year...
what was his name?
he's here.
but do you hear that?
he's not alone.
tell no one.
you're sure that's the ghost you saw?
I think so. He responded to his name, anyway.
according to his obituary, he was 52.
died of a stroke.
well, that's weird. 'cause ghosts usually appear one of two ways.
how they looked at the moment of their death, or how they looked in life.
half these ghosts were rotting and decomposing.
it says here he died at the hospital.
what was he even doing at the lake?
sometimes spirits gather. I've seen it before.
but it's usually around the place of their death.
so this is where they all died?
you'd think, but I couldn't find any mass deaths in the vicinity.
do you remember the plane crash a few years ago?
Yeah. But that was almost 20 miles away.
so what are they doing there?
keeping a big fat secret. "Tell no one."
not a lot of subtext there.
unfortunately, our instructions came a little bit late.
it's the biologist I told you about from the university.
he found heavy concentrations of a particular pathogen in the water.
the same pathogen found in the waters filled with bodies after hurricane Katrina.
so they're actually in there?
we'll know soon enough.
health department's gonna dredge the lake.
Oh! That's my appointment with Sam.
well, go! Go. Get out of here.
what?
no, but I want it back. Give it back!
you gave it to me.
I did not give it to you.
give it.
well, here look. If you want it so badly.
well, I just wanted to show you the article.
you always do this.
Hey, Eli.
this is Nikki.
Hi. It's nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too.
OK. Buddy. Take care.
well, listen. Thank you so much for helping us out.
Oh, sure. Um...
is this going to be a joint session?
no, it's just me. But we were running so late,
I didn't have a chance to take Nikki back...
it's fine. Don't worry about it. Not a problem.
I'll just grab a cup of coffee and meet you afterwards.
thank you.
past-life regression is just a kind of hypno-therapy.
with all due respect,
I just don't get how discovering that I had a past life.
is going to help me find this one.
all right. The one that I lost.
it loosens the subconscious.
my subconscious?
do you want to know what my subconscious is telling me?
it is telling me that something off.
good, that's good. Keep going.
well, Nikki for example. Ok?
she's beautiful. She's smart. She's blonde?
blonde? You're into blondes?
no. That she has nice hair.
I remembered how it felt when I put my arm around her.
I mean, I remember how it smelled.
well, then why can't I remember at all jerking her around for 10 years?
maybe you just didn't want to marry her.
OK. So I was Mr. Can't Commit.
that's what everyone says.
you know what I think? I think I remember wanting to get married.
I feel like that I had finally met the right person and then...
tell me about her.
well, that we wanted to have kids.
I mean, maybe we were even trying.
if that's true, then why isn't she telling me about that?
by she you mean...?
Nikki. Who else?
you tell me.
Nikki can't be the only person you dated.
I want you to consider that maybe...just maybe...
there's someone else.
wait, someone more important than the woman I spent half my adult life with?
look, I just think that's kinda hard to imagine.
look, I...I really gotta talk to her.
but thanks. This has been a big help.
did they find anything?
Yeah. Plenty.
a reporter said that it's 8 victims and counting.
victims? Is that what they are?
Paula's father died in a hospital.
Yeah, well that's what his obit said.
maybe the paper got it wrong.
anyway, it looks like they're going to be out here a while.
I don't hear anything.
they're here.
so how'd it go with Sam? - So-so.
as his shrink there's only so much I can tell you was.
what I almost told him.
which was?
that he's Jim, your husband.
and anything he remembers about anyone he loved is you.
so he remembered something?
just that he wanted to have kids.
well, that's huge!
he thinks he wants to have them with her.
what am I going to do?
you've disturbed us. All of us.
all we asked for was your silence.
I couldn't stop this if I wanted to.
it's the health department and the police.
they want answers.
Edwin, we know you have a family that cared about you.
they deserve to find out what happened to you.
just tell us how we can help.
what is it that you want...
to protect the living.
from what?
got another one.
what if they just all died of the same thing?
some chemical, toxic-something?
in the lake?
I think the C. D. C. would say that the dead people are the problem.
and bothers me is not how they got there, but why they stayed.
your Latte, and the cappuccino. - Thanks.
well, they were just hanging around their bodies, right?
Yeah. That's the upside.
that's an upside?
you know, it just means as spirits they weren't lured there by someone or something.
what do you mean? Like some kinda ghost cult?
no. More like the ghosts in the tunnels, you know, or the watchers.
the watchers?
a group of spirits who made all the threats about Jim.
they said that there would be a price to pay for what I can do.
Ahh. There's Sam.
and no Nikki. And he's heading toward the store.
go. Go be with him.
I don't know if I'm up for being his "good friend" right now.
go!
all right. Ok.
Hey, Melinda. That's funny.
I was just coming to see you.
do you have to go back to work or can you talk for a bit?
no. I'm good. - Great.
thanks for, you know, letting Nikki stay with you.
Oh, yeah. It's no problem.
I didn't even see her last night.
Yeah, she said you were still asleep when she came in.
and she was asleep when I left. So.
Yeah. She's a night person.
I mean, at least that's what she tells me.
I guess both of us were.
she'd do crosswords. I would read the sports pages.
we'd stay up... I hate crosswords.
I don't even remember.
although, you know it's funny.
I do remember Ryan Howard's 2006 batting average...
wait. How do you know that?
you hear something enough times it kinda sticks.
look, Melinda, what I wanted to ask you is,
how is it I remember something as stupid as sports trivia
but I don't remember something that Nikki and I fought about for years?
in my head, I remember wanting to have kids.
and Nikki didn't?
no, she says she did.
so this big memory breakthrough I'm having is wrong.
and she's gotta be right.
I mean, she sounds right.
I'm being the typical guy, dragging my heels.
not all guys are like that.
my husband wasn't.
I was always the one dragging my heels.
but Jim, he...
he wanted everything that you're remembering...
which has to mean something, right?
what to me and Nikki?
no, to you.
it's none of my business.
but maybe you...maybe you shouldn't listen to what everyone else says, not about the stuff that really matters.
you know who you are.
when you start believing that, you'll get back to you, to...
to what? To being the guy like your husband?
committed, confident enough in himself.
in the world, to bring another human being into it?
but you see, I wasn't.
so pretending that I was is just wishful thinking.
thank you so much for coming.
of course, you seemed upset.
I don't understand.
I tell you something weird happened at the lake,
and then the next thing I know I get a call from the health department recommending that I should go on a course of antibiotics.
and then I turn on the TV and see them pulling dead bodies out of water that I was just swimming in.
I know this must be scary...
it's disgusting.
I wish I could make you feel better.
but unfortunately, I think I'm about to make you feel worse.
what are you talking about?
I need to ask you about your father.
first I need you to consider the possibility that parts of us may exist after our bodies have stopped.
Why?
because I've talked to your father's ghost.
he was up at the lake.
he's there...
no, this is...this is crazy.
Paula, you said you felt a presence,
you think my dad is one of the corpses they're pulling out of that water?
look, I know this is hard to accept...
no, literally. There's no way.
Why?
he's right here.
your father was cremated...where?
is this what you wanted? To be cremated?
I was done with my body.
I wanted my family to be done with it, too.
I thought, somehow, it would be easier for them.
and now they have to feel your loss all over again.
protect the living.
you meant, from what happened to you.
we were betrayed.
look what's become of us.
it's just how you see yourselves.
no. It's how they'll see us too.
my wife, my daughter.
they'll be forced to...
no. No. You can talk to them.
you can help them through this.
and they'll remember you just as you were.
and then you can move on.
we're not going anywhere.
we've waited.
there's business to finish.
what is it that you want to finish?
you mean who.
if they went to the movies they should been back by now.
or if they went to dinner...
I don't know where they are.
and I don't want to know.
well, you should want to know
when your competition looks like this.
it's tough love, girlfriend. And you gotta hear this.
OK. So what do you want me to do?
get into the game!
you gotta fight fire with fire!
look, it's not like I can throw on a bikini and mud wrestle for the guy.
well, you can't just sit around and do nothing.
does it look like I'm doing nothing?
no, it looks like you're helping another ghost.
not just one ghost, a lot of them.
OK, and they left loved ones behind.
and if I don't figure out who dumped their bodies...
I am not suggesting that this work isn't important.
I'm just saying that ghosts can keep.
I'm not so sure Sam can.
Yeah. Neither am I.
then why don't you do something about it?
because nothing...
nothing I can do will get him to remember me...
or choose me.
all I can do is having faith.
that's all I have right now.
faith.
it's so nice to meet you.
Carl gets so few visitors lately.
not that we're surprised in his business.
who wants to watch someone dying?
when did he close the funeral home?
when the cancer made it impossible for him to work.
did he take care of your family?
no. He...helped some friends of mine.
I keep wishing someone close might get through to him.
he doesn't listen to me anymore.
get through to him?
he has so little time, and he's in such pain...
but he won't take the pills they give him.
I guess he's afraid it'll make the end come sooner.
but really, why go on like this?
do you want me to talk to him?
thank you.
come on.
my name is Melinda Gordon.
I don't know you.
what do you want?
I came to talk about the lake.
what lake?
where the bodies are.
where you put them. Didn't you?
part of me hoped I would die before this day.
and the other part?
what if they're waiting for me?
why did you do it?
I thought I had no choice.
what do you mean?
the big mortuary chains kept calling to get me to sell.
but my great grandfather built that place from nothing.
and I was proud.
and I wanted a better price.
what happened?
what always happens.
they undercut me. I couldn't compete. The money ran out.
and when the furnace finally broke down,
I was desperate.
it's no excuse.
sometimes I think...
the cancer is a punishment.
all this pain.
your wife said there's pain medication that you won't take.
I feel evil.
Carl, you made a mistake. You're not evil.
no. No. I feel evil around me.
everywhere.
you're right. Carl, they're here.
all the ghosts of the bodies that you threw into that lake.
Oh, no.
I see them.
Oh, please.
they're angry because of what you did. But I can help.
please just give me the names of all the people that you threw into the lake.
I can talk to their families. I can help them heal.
to help them suffer, you mean.
then they'll drop their anger, ok?
not until he's suffered like we have.
you need to go into the light.
there's forgiveness there.
Carl, take your medicine.
I went back and looked where he told me to.
back to the funeral home?
wow, you're a glutton for gruesome.
yeah well with Mary sunshine bunking at my house,
I already feel like formaldehyde girl.
formaldehyde girl, that's funny.
sorry. Not funny.
did you get the list of names?
Yeah. I'm just trying to see if their I. D. matches what we found.
Hey, here's Paula's dad.
was everybody on the list scheduled for cremation?
cremation, cremation.
Yeah, it looks like they were meant to be...
cremated. I'll call you back.
how are you?
I'm fine.
um, do you have a minute to talk about Sam?
sure. What about him?
well, first of all, I want to apologize for imposing on you at your house and here at work now.
but I really...honestly, I didn't know who else to go to.
you know how you grow up imagining what it'll be like to be in love?
you picture your boyfriend, your husband.
and not just the good times...
but the fights and the problems, too.
Yeah. Sure.
could you ever have imagined something like this happening?
a guy that you loved just wakes up one day and then suddenly has no idea who you are?
no. Never.
Really? Not at all?
I...I don't understand.
I guess I was so blown away by what happened to Sam that I really didn't notice it at first, but, uh...
do you think it's a little odd that he's staying in your garage?
the same garage he was supposed to be doing designs for?
and where are the plans? I haven't seen any of those.
what are you driving at?
when I first came here, my idea was a quick in and out.
let Sam know that he was forgiven, maybe fill in a few memory blanks, and then say goodbye.
but now that I've seen who he is, this new Sam who wants kids, who's ready to settle down.
I...I don't want to let him go.
what does that have to do with me?
that's what I'm trying to find out.
shouldn't you be asking Sam?
you're not gonna make this easy, are you?
I thought I just did.
Mrs. Sessick, you startled me.
I apologize for coming by without calling.
I thought you'd want to know.
Carl died, a few hours ago.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what you said, but after you left, he seemed to change.
he relaxed, and decided to take his pain medicine.
after a few hours later, he took my hand.
then his eyes opened wide, like he saw something amazing.
and that was it.
that look in his eyes, he must have just seen the face of his maker.
don't you think?
that's a lovely notion.
thank you so much, Melinda, for giving my husband peace.
how did I get here?
Oh, no! No. Melinda!
Oh, please god, anywhere but here.
for you, there's nowhere but here.
forgive me.
please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you for forgiveness.
please! Please!
that's not what you'll find here.
help me!
tell me, how can I help you?
mom, you wanted to talk about this.
no one is mad at you, Mom.
speak for yourself.
when Edwin had his stroke, he was jogging a few miles from home.
he had no wallet, no ID.
so the hospital needed someone to say that it was him.
I went.
but I couldn't do it.
I just...I couldn't look at him.
Paula was there by then, so she did it.
I made my own daughter go in and look at her dead father.
mom, I didn't mind doing it.
there was no shame in what happened to him.
why couldn't I just look at him?
marlene, there's no shame in what you did, either.
most people never see their deceased loved ones ever.
my daughter, she said that you knew something about Edwin's spirit.
he is stuck here? He can't move on?
that's right.
he and the others spirits whose bodies were put in the lake,
they're earthbound, which means they haven't been able to cross over into the light.
why not?
they don't want you to know what happened to them.
out of shame.
that's why your husband tried to scare Paula away that night at the lake.
can we help them?
you might.
but right now, they're very angry.
until the right moment comes...
if Edwin's ghost is still here, then that means he saw what I did when he died.
please give me the chance to make it right.
Sam, please don't sneak up on me like that!
sorry.
I'm sorry. The door was open.
look, I took Nikki to a hotel last night.
and, um, I just wanted to come by and see if you were ok.
I'm fine.
are you sure? Because you seemed a little tense, and frankly, so did Nikki.
no, really. I'm fine.
OK.
well, then I'll go back to the hotel.
Why?
I mean, she's been here almost a week, so what are you going to do?
I don't know. It's weird.
I feel things when I'm with her.
nice things.
her smell is familiar.
I recognize the feel of her hand when I hold it.
you know, it's comfortable.
OK.
Melinda, not everybody can have what you had with your husband. All right?
and given my track record, I'm not sure I'd even be capable of that.
of course you are.
maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
and, look, if suddenly I feel like I should take a chance, you know, get some feelings back, maybe that's progress.
maybe that's a good thing.
maybe I should reach out with both hands.
all right.
don't.
don't what?
you can do better for yourself than "comfortable"
or "maybe getting some feelings back.
hold out for more.
what?
what am I holding out for?
everything.
hold out for everything.
you know, that's easy for you to say.
you had everything.
who's there?
Carl, why are you here?
you said there would be forgiveness for me, you lied.
did you look into the light?
I saw it, but they told me I couldn't go in.
why not?
because of my shame.
but you apologized.
I mean, you tried to make things right.
you can come out of the shadows now.
no, I can't. They're looking for me.
they want me to go with them.
those spirits are angry because of what you did.
nobody can keep you from the light.
it's not them. It's the others.
the others? -Spirits I've never seen before.
but they said they know you.
they know me?
they said they gave you a warning, but you didn't listen,
and something you cherished was lost.
And?
they said you believed in things that weren't right,
and trusting those things might hurt others...
and you.
Hello?
I'm here.
what do you want from me?
what did I do to offend you?
you did nothing.
then why did you take my husband away?
fate did that, not us.
you came to me and you said that death would touch something that I loved.
and before I knew it, he was dead.
we just warned you to be careful.
Yeah. 'Cause that's what you were doing was warning.
with all your lies and threats.
we don't lie or make threats.
you told Carl that he couldn't cross over.
the light has never denied anyone.
the light doesn't make the choice.
we each do.
we? You mean you.
no, each of us for ourselves.
you wondered why these lake spirits stayed earthbound.
well, it's the same reason that Carl did.
when the light opens, we each see ourselves reflected back.
so Carl's shame kept him here.
when spirits feel unworthy, sometimes we choose to stay back to work together for the living.
to make ourselves worthy.
what spirits stay back to do that?
I haven't seen any.
you're meeting four of them now.
you?
why do you think we're still here?
so when Carl said that you asked him to join you...?
they explained it to me, and I understand now.
this is what I want.
are you sure?
because they said it's your choice.
you can move on now.
I want to be one of them.
all right.
will you help me fix the wrongs I did?
how?
by taking away their shame.
thank you all for coming tonight.
we'd asked for family and friends,
and I just never realized how many friends we have.
Hey, Eli. - Hi, Sam.
I wasn't sure what to say,
so I asked my darling English major Paula for some help.
and she wrote down some thoughts for me.
Paula? Don't be shy.
tonight we send our loved ones "to where we thought they'd already gone."
it seems like a detour, "an embarrassing wrong turn."
but the truth is, we never knew where they were going.
we pretended we did, and that made us feel better.
but every path leads to the unknown.
some paths join others, and some split off on their own.
we want to know where they all go, but maybe we shouldn't.
maybe the more we insist on knowing, "the less we'll be able to learn from life's twists and turns."
I know what you're thinking, "that the unknown is scary."
but that's ok.
we're human.
maybe before we feel free, "we're supposed to feel fearful."
maybe it means more that way.
so let's all say goodbye now.
and remember, that no matter what we're feeling, "there's no shame."
no shame at all.
Oh, hey, Sam.
Nikki's downstairs.
she wanted to talk to you first.
first?
heh, I...I don't know why you've been so nice to me.
letting me stay here in your house, when obviously...
it's not easy to say this,
we have our whole lives ahead of us.
and whatever you're feeling right now,
I hope you can understand why I did what I did.
someday maybe you'll see that it was for the best.
you don't have to...
the weirdest part is Sam is this whole other guy.
he's a grown-up who realizes he wants more.
he talks about holding out.
and that's sort of amazing, because everything I've been holding out for,
he is ready to give.
and I don't know why, but I feel like I have to thank you for that.
no hard feelings, I hope.
you...you deserve every happiness.
thank you.
thank you.
thanks for coming.
please, uh...
just be happy.
Bye.
Bye.
Bonjour, monsieur.
Bonjour, madame and company.
good afternoon.
as you see, this lovely city all around us is Paris.
and this lovely park is, of course, the Bois de Boulogne.
pardon me.
who am I?
well, allow me to introduce myself.
I am Honore Lachaille.
born: Paris.
date:
not lately.
this is 1900. So let's just say not in this century.
circumstances:
comfortable.
profession:
lover and collector of beautiful things.
not antiques, mind you.
younger things.
Yes, definitely younger.
married? What for?
now, please don't misunderstand.
like everywhere else, most people in Paris get married.
but not all.
there are some who will not marry and some who do not marry.
but here in Paris, those who will not are usually men and those who do not are usually women.
now, for example, here we find exhibit A:
the married kind.
these ladies stood their ground and won
and I salute them, every one
here are some others to behold
for whom the bells have never tolled
Oh, what a poor, defenseless pair
in those pathetic rags they wear
and there is the future.
someday, each and every one of them will either be married or unmarried. How adorable they are!
each time I see a little girl of 5 or 6 or 7.
I can't resist the joyous urge
to smile and say thank heaven
for little girls
for little girls get bigger every day
thank heaven for little girls
they grow up in the most delightful way
those little eyes so helpless and appealing
one day will flash and send you crashing through the ceiling
thank heaven for little girls
thank heaven for them all
no matter where, no matter who
without them What would little boys do?
thank heaven
thank heaven
thank heaven
for little girls
this story is about a little girl.
it could be any one of those girls playing there. But it isn't.
it's about one in particular.
that one. Her name is Gigi.
Gigi!
what you have to look forward to!
those little eyes so helpless and appealing
one day will flash and send you crashing through the ceiling
thank heaven
thank heaven for them all
no matter where, no matter who
without them what would little boys do?
thank heaven
thank heaven
thank heaven
Hello, Grandmama.
Gigi, where have you been?
playing in the park. I had to, Grandmama.
my foot fell asleep in class. It wouldn't wake up.
did you forget what day it is?
it's Tuesday.
aunt Alicia! Well, I'd better run.
you cannot go to your Aunt Alicia's looking like that.
put your coat on. Let me comb your hair.
Yes, Grandmama.
I hate this coat. It makes my legs feel so long.
Yes, your legs are long.
you know sometimes I'm sorry you never learned to dance.
but I want to, Grandmama. Why don't you let me take lessons?
no. Not the same mistake twice.
your mother took singing lessons, and look where she ended up.
she seems happy. - Happy!
I went to see her one night. I couldn't even find her.
in the first act
she was behind a tree.
in the second act
behind a tenor.
mama's awake. Isn't it early?
she's on this afternoon. If I Were King.
that's more than she does in the whole opera.
and when I think of that delightful old gentleman with all those flour mills.
who?
nothing.
you go to school every morning. You see your Aunt Alicia once a week.
that's all the lessons you need.
when the time comes, you'll be ready.
ready for what, Grandmama?
enough. Now run.
goodbye, Grandmama. - Goodbye, Gigi.
more powerful, monsieur. Sixty kilometers an hour!
there's nothing faster on the road, monsieur. Not here or in America.
your uncle is here, monsieur.
of course, the smaller is a first-rate machine, monsieur.
naturally, the larger one is more expensive.
I'd be happy to demonstrate both.
I beg your pardon, Monsieur Gaston. Your father wanted me to ask you
according to this morning's opening at "la Bourse" it's gone up 12 points.
I thought it would.
Monsieur Lachaille, about the car.
send it over in the morning with the bill.
Yes, monsieur. Thank you. But which one?
my dear fellow, I don't care. Either one.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Uncle. Why didn't you come upstairs?
I was afraid I'd meet my brother and sister-in-law.
you would have.
- I have to tell you, your parents bore me to death.
me too. - But I've known them longer
so they've been boring me longer.
after you.
your father is actually quite unique.
he was a bore at the age of 5.
all he has to say is, "Hello," and I can barely keep my eyes open.
Armenonville.
I waited for you at the embassy last Sunday. What happened?
the thought of another embassy tea paralyzed me.
instead, I had tea with an old friend Madame Alvarez.
Madame Alvarez? - Yes, you know her.
or knew her once, didn't you?
does she say I did? - I think she's mentioned it.
then I suppose I did.
it's the one place in Paris where I can go and relax.
whose luncheon are you taking me to today?
we have to go.
I'm meeting a heavenly creature there.
you're still young, Uncle, aren't you?
not compared to her.
but I must say, I am compared to you.
maybe it's the women you go with. How old is Liane?
about 30.
that may be it. Youth is the thing, Gaston.
youth! Stay close to the young and a little rubs off.
I'm bored.
bored?
look at all the captivating fascinating things there are to do
name two
look at all the pleasures
all the myriad of treasures we have got
like what?
look at Paris in the spring When each solitary thing
is more beautiful than ever before
you can hear every tree almost saying, "Look at me!"
what color are the trees? - Green!
what color were they last year? - Green!
and next year? - Green!
it's a bore.
don't you marvel at the power of the mighty Eiffel Tower
knowing there it will remain evermore
climbing up to the sky
over 90 stories high - How many stories? - Ninety!
how many yesterday? - Ninety!
and tomorrow? - Ninety!
it's a bore!
the river Seine
all it can do is flow
but think of wine
it's red or white - But think of girls - It's either yes or no.
and if it's no or if it's yes It simply couldn't matter less
but think of a race
with your horse in seventh place
then he suddenly begins
and he catches up and wins with a roar!
it's a bore!
life is thrilling as can be
simply not my cup of tea
it's a gay, romantic fling
if you like that sort of thing - It's intriguing - It's fatiguing
it's a game
it's the same dull world wherever you go
whatever place you are at
the Earth is round
but everything on it is flat
don't tell me Venice has no lure
just a town without a sewer
the Leaning Tower I adore
indecision is a bore
but think of the thrill of a bullfight in Seville
when the bull is uncontrolled
and he charges at the bold matador!
it's a bore!
think of lunch beneath the trees
stop the carriage, if you please
you mean you don't want to come?
the thought of lunch leaves me numb
but I implore
Oh, no, Uncle.
it's a bore!
goodbye, Honor.
come in.
Mamita. - Gaston!
what a wonderful surprise.
how do you feel today, dear Mamita?
fine, Gaston. And the better for seeing you.
you've gotten a trifle thinner, and it's most becoming.
you think so? - Oh, yes.
come and sit down.
in your chair.
thank you.
what beautiful material.
very chic!
just the sort of thing Honor used to wear.
a bit more conservative, perhaps.
would you like a sweet?
no, thank you. But I would love a cup of your chamomile tea.
but of course.
more than just one, I hope.
do you have a telephone yet, Mamita?
no, not yet.
not until Gigi is old enough to have secrets and admirers.
but there's one upstairs if it's important.
it's not important.
Gigi's not at home?
no. This is Tuesday.
the day she has luncheon with her aunt Alicia.
how is your sister? I haven't seen her for quite a while.
I don't wonder.
she never sets foot out of her apartment or her past.
and quite a past it was so she says.
according to the stories Honor? tells me what she says is quite true.
aren't you afraid of her influence on Gigi?
not at all.
she finds Gigi a trifle backward, which is true, and she educates her.
educates her?
last week, she taught her to eat cold lobster to perfection.
what in heaven's name for?
she says it's extremely useful.
marvelous.
it's so good to be here.
it's always a pleasure to watch the rich enjoying the comforts of the poor.
especially you, dear Gaston.
how does your sister look? Still as young as ever?
Yes, Alicia is always the same.
living in the past must agree with her.
when I think it was in 1859, she went off with her first sultan.
then came her Duke of Milan, her King of Spain, her khedive, her maharajah.
she's remarkable looking.
good day, Charles.
Mademoiselle.
what are we having for lunch?
ortolans.
Oh, dear! Are they difficult?
slowly, Gigi. Slowly.
the racing season is over.
good day, Aunt Alicia.
now let's go into luncheon.
Yes, Aunt Alicia.
today you will learn to eat ortolans.
what are ortolans, Aunt?
exquisite little birds.
most people attack them like cannibals.
you must learn to eat them properly.
bad table manners have broken up more households than infidelity.
did you work hard in school today? What did you study?
history.
Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.
how depressing.
what else? - English.
English? I suppose we must.
they refuse to learn French.
who are your friends?
Ortolans should be cut in two with a quick stroke of the knife.
there must be no grating of the blade on the plate.
now bite up each piece.
the bones don't matter.
go on eating while you answer my questions.
but don't talk with your mouth full.
well, you can do it. If I can do it, you can.
what friends have you made?
none.
I'm always on my own.
why does Grandmama stop me from accepting invitations?
she's right for once.
you'd only be invited by ordinary people.
what about us? Aren't we ordinary people?
why are we different?
they have weak heads and careless bodies.
besides, they are married.
but I don't think you would understand.
Oh, yes, Aunt, I understand.
we don't marry, is that it?
marriage is not forbidden to us.
but instead of getting married at once, it sometimes happens we get married at last.
enough. We must finish lunch and get on with your lessons.
now, go on. Go on, go on!
without knowledge of jewelry, my dear Gigi, a woman is lost.
do you remember Madame Dunard, who was here the other day?
did you notice that rope of black pearls around her throat?
Yes! It was beautiful.
dipped.
dipped. Given to her by the man she loves, whose love is obviously beginning to cool and she doesn't know it.
it's just a matter of time now.
now, let us see what you remember.
what is this?
a marquise diamond.
a marquise-shaped diamond.
this?
this is a topaz?
a topaz?
among my jewels? Are you mad?
it's a yellow diamond of the first quality.
you'll have to go a long way to see one like it.
this? - An emerald.
how beautiful.
do you see that blue flame darting about in the depths of the green light?
only the most beautiful emerald contain that miracle of elusive blue.
who gave it to you, Aunt? - A king.
a great king? - No, a little one.
great kings do not give very large stones.
why not?
in my opinion, it's because they don't feel they have to.
who does give the valuable jewels?
who?
Oh, the shy, the proud.
and the social climbers. They think it's a sign of culture.
but it doesn't matter who gives them, as long as you never wear anything second-rate.
wait for the first-class jewels, Gigi.
hold on to your ideals.
come over here to the light, Gigi.
open your mouth.
with teeth like that, I could have devoured all Paris and most of Europe.
but I can't complain. I had a good bite of it.
tell your grandmama to get you some astringent lotion.
you don't use face powder, do you?
grandmama won't let me. - I should hope not.
you have an impossible nose, a nondescript mouth.
your cheekbones are too high.
but we can do something with the rest of you.
your teeth, your eyes, your eyelashes, your hair.
we can and we will.
you must learn to choose cigars.
aunt, but I don't smoke cigars.
of course you don't smoke cigars.
but a man does.
everything I teach you has a good reason.
love, my dear Gigi, is a thing of beauty, like a work of art.
and like a work of art, it is created by artists.
the greater the artist, the greater the art.
and what makes an artist?
cigars and jewelry?
you are from another planet.
get on with your work.
a necklace is love
a ring is love
a rock from some obnoxious little king is love
a sapphire with a star is love
an ugly black cigar is love
everything you are is love
you would think it would embarrass all the people here in Paris
to be thinking every minute of love
I don't understand the Parisians
making love every time they get a chance
I don't understand the Parisians
wasting every lovely night on romance
anytime
and under every tree in town
they're in session two by two
what a crime
with all there is to see in town
they can't find something else to do
I don't understand how Parisians
never tire of walking hand in hand
but they seem to love it
and speak highly of it
I don't understand
the Parisians!
I don't understand the Parisians!
when it's warm
they take a carriage ride at night
close their eyes and hug and kiss
when it's cold
they simply move inside at night
there must be more to life than this
I don't understand the Parisians
thinking love so miraculous and grand
but they rave about it
and won't live without it
I don't understand
the Parisians!
stop.
what are you doing there?
Gaston, do you make love all the time?
I beg your pardon?
do you make love all the time? - Heavens, no.
the only people who make love all the time are liars.
was that the subject of your lesson today?
how did you know I was having a lesson? - I just came from your house.
too bad I wasn't there. We could've played cards, and I could've beaten you.
but you cheat.
I can, but with you, I don't have to.
you watch your tongue, my girl.
I'm not your girl. - Thank you for that.
if I have a little girl, I'll see to it she's more respectful than you.
come with me. - Where?
to the Ice Palace. - I don't skate.
I'll buy you a drink. - I don't drink.
a sweet one. - Are you going to skate?
no, but I'm calling for Madame d'Exelmans.
Liane? Your lady love?
no, thank you. I've had enough of that for today.
I'm not going to woo her on ice.
come along before I spank you.
you wouldn't dare!
Oh, I wouldn't, eh?
sit down.
sit down.
haven't you ever seen an ice rink?
never.
grandmama says going out distracts one from more serious matters.
a "barbotage" for the lady.
what's that? - Quiet.
champagne for me. Well-iced.
Yes, Monsieur Lachaille.
is that the scandalous Madame d'Exelmans?
Yes, that's she.
tell me, Gigi, the way you express yourself does your grandmother ever hear you talk this way?
she never listens to me much.
which reminds me, she mustn't know I was here with you.
and why not? What's wrong with being with me?
it isn't you. It's here.
I told you. This isn't serious matters.
and just what are serious matters?
I don't remember it all by heart.
one mustn't read novels; they depress you.
don't wear powder; it ruins the complexion.
don't wear corsets; they spoil the figure.
what do you think of Liane?
she's pretty.
Yes, she is.
but...
but what?
common.
common?
how do you mean "common"? Ordinary common or coarse common?
ordinary.
and coarse. Well, I really must go. Please come soon.
thank you for the drink. - It was a pleasure.
Hello, my darling.
you waltz divinely.
thank you, my love.
I'll let you know when I'll be in for my next lesson.
Yes, madame.
darling.
at Maxim's?
thank you, monsieur.
dreadful man.
you seem to have lessons with him often enough.
he's an excellent teacher. I made amazing progress.
but he's so conceited. So superior in an inferior way.
I can't stand him.
shall we go?
Gaston and Liane are joining me here at Maxim's tonight.
I'm giving a small party in honor of a heavenly creature I met this afternoon.
she's... Pardon me.
she's the sister of the heavenly creature I gave a party for last night.
what a marvelous place Maxim's is!
not only gay and beautiful, but in one thing unique:
in Maxim's, everybody minds his own business.
no one is the slightest bit interested in whom one is with.
there's that wretched man Louis de Latour
with his latest horrible amour
isn't she a mess! Isn't she a sight!
let's invite them out tomorrow night
honor. Lachaille, Honor. Lachaille
with another twinkle in his eye
isn't it a shame! Isn't it a crime!
seeing him so happy all the time
there's Gaston Lachaille with his little friend
is that passion never going to end?
did you see her ring? Not a bagatelle
dear Liane is doing very well
she's a lovable one tonight, isn't she?
what is she up to?
she's so gay tonight
she's like spring tonight
she's a rollicking frolicking thing tonight
so disarming soft and charming
she is not thinking of me
no, she's not thinking of me
in her eyes tonight
there's a glow tonight
they're so bright they could light fontainebleau tonight
she's so gracious so vivacious
she is not thinking of me
bless her little heart
crooked to the core
acting out a part
what a rollicking, frolicking bore!
she's such fun tonight
she's a treat tonight
you could spread her on bread. She's so sweet tonight
so devoted sugarcoated
that it's heartwarming to see
Oh, she's simmering with love
Oh, she's shimmering with love
Oh, she's not thinking of me
she is not thinking of me
someone has set her on fire
who's turning her furnace up higher?
Oh, she's hot but it's not for Gaston!
Oh, she's gay tonight
Oh so gay tonight
a gigantic romantic clich? tonight
how she blushes! How she gushes!
how she fills me with envious
she's so ooh la la la la
so untrue la la la la
Oh, she's not thinking of me
I knew she was up to something.
I knew it. There had to be a reason for last night.
but what was I to do?
trail after her? Spy on her?
sniff around like a bloodhound? - Of course not.
heaven knows, I'm not jealous. Thank you for that.
why should I follow her?
no reason at all. What did you do?
I hired detectives.
and the results are nauseating.
the Riverton Agency just telephoned me that she and her oily acrobat arrived a half an hour ago in a cozy little inn at Honfleur.
well.
without skates.
most disagreeable.
come, my boy. You're not the first.
this sort of thing has happened before.
and to some very good people.
alfred de Musset, Victor Hugo, Napoleon.
even to me. Isn't that true, Manuel?
Yes, indeed, sir. Many, many, many times.
well, not that many.
but a skating instructor.
a skating instructor!
it is always a skating instructor.
or some such specimen.
isn't that true, Manuel? - Absolutely, sir.
remember dear little Madame Dumelle and Marmaluc the Terrible Turk?
there you are.
a wrestler from the Folies Bergere.
there was Madame Laura and the swimming coach.
hurry up, Manuel.
and Madame d'Albert and the riding master.
Mademoiselle Monique and the weight lifter, Madame Bocher and the plumber.
that's enough, Manuel. You've made your point.
here, put this in your mouth.
one can't be a Don Juan to one's valet, can one?
I only keep him to prevent him from talking to others.
Oh, come, Gaston, cheer up.
cheer up? I couldn't be in better spirits.
good. I'm delighted the deadly affair is over.
the woman was common. Plainly and unmistakably common from her painted toenails to the top of her bleached head.
I'm glad to be rid of her. What do we do today?
what do we do?
we're going to Honfleur, naturally.
are you mad? I never want to see her again.
of course you don't.
but you're not going to let a woman have the last word.
where is your sense of honor?
your male patriotism?
nonsense.
listen to your uncle, Monsieur Gaston. He's an old campaigner.
how would you end it?
I'll write her a note.
there is no way of writing it without it reeking of wounded pride.
Victor Hugo couldn't pull it off.
then I'll telephone her.
and what would you say?
Liane, you deceived me with a skating instructor.
I never want to see you again.
you'll sound like a jealous schoolboy.
that's impossible.
that's true.
that's true. What do I do?
you go to Honfleur and throw her out like a man.
that's a bore.
a bore? Not at all.
it's pride.
just imagine your chagrin
when she sees you wander in
what a moment supreme
when she totters with a scream - What will she do? - Scream.
what did yours do? - Scream.
what do they all do? - Scream.
it's a bore.
but think of the bliss of the pleasure you would miss.
when she topples in a heap and you leave her there to weep on the floor.
it's a bore.
you must catch her if you can
for the dignity of man
take advantage of the chance
you owe it, sir, to France this is war!
all right.
but it's a bore.
turn it around and leave it there.
they are there.
Terrible-looking rodent, isn't he?
terrible, but typical.
those chaps all look alike.
she looks older in the daylight.
much older. I don't envy him.
neither do I.
she never kissed me like that.
how is she kissing him? - Wholeheartedly.
what do you expect?
you're legitimate. He's forbidden fruit.
when do we make our move?
wait, wait.
come on.
Monsieur Lachaille, what a surprise. I am honored.
don't be. Come on, get up!
wait, wait! You are making a mistake.
it was just a coincidence, my meeting madame here.
it was a coincidence, I suppose that your lips just happened to meet in a long, ardent, passionate
you keep out of this.
I don't want any discussions. For 1000 francs, this never happened.
you leave the Ice Palace and disappear. Forever.
but... - No "buts."
you're coming with us now.
we'll take you to the nearest railroad station.
1000 francs?
there is nothing more to be said. Goodbye, madame.
from the bottom of my heart, goodbye.
Gaston, my love.
what happened?
liane d'Exelmans has committed suicide. Again!
I'm sorry, girl. What did you say?
I didn't know he left her.
my word!
of course.
call me as soon as you hear anything. Anything at all.
how marvelous!
Paris agog.
why didn't you tell me that Gaston and Liane had broken up?
I didn't know it. It must've happened over the weekend.
when was the suicide?
last night. - How did she do it?
the usual way, insufficient poison.
say, how many times has she done it now?
good evening, Manuel.
good evening, Honor.
Gaston, my boy.
Congratulations.
your first suicide.
what an achievement. And at your age.
like everyone in Paris, we were just talking about you.
thank you, Honor. I came over to...
may I add mine, sir?
thank you, Manuel. I came over to get a...
it was a stunning victory.
where is the champagne? - It's ready, sir.
I came over to get away from the telephone.
I can imagine. Any news from the corpse?
fully recovered, according to late morning editions.
and how do you feel?
oddly enough, I'm not quite sure.
make a guess.
well, I'd say edgy.
edgy?
almost depressed. I don't know why.
there must be a reason.
I suppose it's to be expected.
I'm told Verdi felt that way after the first performance of "Aida."
get a glass for yourself. - I have one, sir.
to you, Gaston.
may this be the first of many.
what about tonight? Where do we go? What do we do?
I don't know. I should consider what I do next very carefully.
I've been weighing the idea of going to the country for a while.
you mean, leave Paris?
Yes. Why not?
why not?
that's the one thing you mustn't do.
do you want people to think you're despondent? Disturbed?
if you leave, they will, you know.
no, no. That would be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
no, no, no. For the next few weeks, you should be out every night.
Maxim's, Moulin Rouge, Pre Catalan.
the Pre Catalan is closed.
open it! You must be carefree.
Devil-may-care.
a different girl every night. Keep them guessing who's next.
play the game. Be gay extravagant, outrageous.
grandmama!
imagine. Gaston bought out the opera last night, and brought the entire company to his house for a performance.
I'll go.
Gaston, how are you? You look all in.
is your grandmother home? - Yes, she is.
is that gold?
the handle, yes.
you must be very rich to have a gold handle on your cane.
Gaston, what a nice surprise.
don't let me disturb you, Mamita.
I was just preparing dinner.
smells awfully good.
it's just a pork cassoulet.
it was impossible to get any goose this week.
I'll have them send you a brace from the country.
I brought you some caramels.
thank you, Gaston.
Gaston, you spoil her so.
the champagne is for you.
you spoil me too.
be careful. You'll ruin your hands.
I have a manicure every morning.
what a nuisance.
not like that. - No?
like this.
all right.
where are you going with that tie? - Let's not talk about it.
I'm having a small party for 200 at the Eiffel Tower.
are you going away? - Yes, for the weekend. Trouville.
a little sea air before the next round of parties.
is Trouville by the sea? - Yes, you little idiot.
you expect to find sea air in the mountains?
don't make fun of me. I've never been to the ocean.
what will you eat for dinner tonight?
filet of sole with mussels, for a change.
and a lamb filet with truffles.
it's always the same. It can't compare with your grandmother's cassoulet.
why don't you stay and have some with us?
I wish I could. - Why not?
all right, I will.
but people are waiting for you.
my car's downstairs. I'll send the chauffeur with my apologies.
my uncle will be the host.
honor, he'll do it very well.
I'm dying to take a ride in your beautiful automobile.
let me deliver it.
if you want to.
tell the chauffeur to take this to my uncle's house.
go quickly. - Thank you.
I can't wait to see the face of the janitress.
and after dinner, we'll have a serious game of cards.
and I'll beat you, as usual.
and you'll cheat, as usual.
Gaston, Gigi takes advantage of you.
let her, let her, Mamita.
it amuses me.
how is Honor these days?
the same.
a life devoted to the chase.
we've missed you, Gaston. We haven't seen you since the suicide.
Yes, I've had quite a full schedule lately.
so I've read.
you always do things in the grand manner.
your parties have filled the newspapers.
sometimes the cure is more painful than the illness.
but I have to do it. It's expected of me.
poor Gaston.
you're in a difficult position, aren't you?
Yes, Mamita, yes. Very difficult.
see, the whole of Paris is watching me.
what are you talking of?
the whole world is watching you.
Yes, it's quite a responsibility.
quite a responsibility.
discard two.
ten pounds of sugar.
those aren't very high stakes. Your sugar isn't that good.
I'd rather play you for candy.
it's the same thing, only sugar is healthier.
you just say that because you make it.
Gigi, I heard that. Where are your manners?
it's all right, Mamita. It's all right.
if I lose, what would you really like? Silk stockings?
no. Silk stockings make my legs itch.
I discard one.
what I would really like is a Nile green corset with rococo roses embroidered on the garters.
or a new role for the player piano.
or...
or what?
a look at the ocean.
all right.
if I lose, I'll take you and Mamita to Trouville.
I heard that too.
don't worry, Gaston.
win or lose, Gigi, you will not impose us on poor Gaston for the weekend.
may I have a glass of champagne?
are you losing your mind? Of course you may not.
discard three.
discard one.
now, let's see.
cards are a matter of logic.
I know what I have and I know how many you've drawn.
according to the percentages, you undoubtedly have an ace.
you discarded a 10 and a five and a queen and a three.
you, therefore, must have two aces.
two aces and something smaller.
that's very interesting.
therefore, I win.
and therefore, you lose.
but you cheated. Where did you get that fourth king?
I won, I won, I won!
why, you gypsy! You thief!
you're a muttonhead. Do we go to Trouville?
Yes, yes. You go to Trouville.
grandmama, we go to Trouville.
it's out of the question.
not at all. I'd love it. Believe it or not
I have a better time with this outrageous brat than anybody in Paris. It'll be marvelous fun.
what time tomorrow will we get there? Can I watch you play roulette?
may I stay up late for supper? Is it awfully, awfully upper?
Gigi, you'll drive us wild.
stop, you silly child.
is everybody celebrated full of sin and dissipated?
is it hot enough to blister? Will I be your little sister?
Gigi, you are absurd.
now, not another word.
let her gush and jabber.
let her be enthused.
I cannot remember when I have been more amused - Stop it! - The night they invented champagne.
it's plain as it can be.
they thought of you and me.
the night they invented champagne.
they absolutely knew.
that all we'd want to do.
is fly to the sky on champagne.
and shout to everyone in sight.
that since the world began no woman or a man.
has ever been as happy as we are tonight.
Hello? - Do you come bearing pizza?
I'm not an idiot. - Then get in here.
sit. You're missing it. - What are we watching?
the incomparable Donna Reed Show.
what's in there? - A salad.
salad?
it's a quaint dish sometimes used to precede large quantities of pizza.
it's for me. - Clearly.
so, who's Donna Reed?
what? - You don't know who Donna Reed is?
the quintessential '50s mom with the perfect '50s family?
never without a smile and high heels?
hair that if you hit with a hammer would crack?
so, it's a show? - It's a lifestyle.
it's a religion.
my favorite episode... - Tell me.
...is when their son, Jeff, comes home from school, and nothing happens.
that's a good one.
one of my favorites is when Mary, the daughter, gets a part-time job...
and nothing happens. - Another classic.
so what's this one about?
this one is actually quite filled with intrigue.
the husband, Alex, comes home late for dinner, and he didn't call.
might as well kick the dog, too.
look, she's making doughnuts.
...bind in the sugar department. - I was thinking of something else.
not that my sugary attitude wouldn't make anyone an instant diabetic.
mother-daughter window washing. We should try that.
right after mother-daughter shock treatments.
there's nothing more satisfying than washing windows. Oh, no.
what? Did I miss a spot?
no, I just had an impure thought about your father, Alex.
funny, I don't know why I had it. It isn't the second Saturday of the month.
I heard you had an impure thought about me.
I must now sublimate all my impure thoughts...
by going into the kitchen and making an endless string of perfect casseroles.
you're not even listening to the dialogue. - Ours is better.
I don't know, it all seems kind of nice to me.
what does?
families hanging together, a wife cooking dinner for her husband.
and look, she seems really happy. - She's medicated.
and acting from a script. - Written by a man.
well said, sister suffragette.
what if she likes making doughnuts and dinner for her family...
and keeping things nice for them...
okay, I feel very unpopular right now.
you know, dear, the first 10 years we were married...
I was upset when you came home late for dinner.
then you're not anymore? - No.
you are no longer late for dinner. You're just extremely early for breakfast.
voila! Your breakfast.
Hey, l' m not saying a word.
can brains hurt? - Yes, it's hypochondria hour.
I'm serious. Last night, when I was reading my biology chapters...
I distinctly heard a ping in the vicinity of my brain.
your brain pinged? - Yeah.
it just went ding. - Then your brain dinged. It didn't ping.
a dinging brain isn't any less worrisome than a pinging brain.
you got me there. - So should I go to a tumor doctor?
you don't have a tumor. You're reading too much.
you're probably just losing your eyesight. - Thank you.
you're welcome.
Hi, can you take a little constructive criticism?
no. - Okay, this place could use a makeover.
it needs sprucing up, like a coat of paint.
I don't spruce. - What do you mean you don't spruce?
what he means is he won't spruce. - Taylor, do not start.
me and the rest of the Town Beautification Committee...
have been hounding him for years to freshen up the place.
maybe a couple of nice zinnia pots out front, some yellow awnings...
a peppy little cardboard pig announcing the specials.
but he's a mule.
he won't talk, he won't reason, he won't spruce.
you might as well forget it, Lorelai. I'm forgetting it, too.
finally a Taylor Doose position I can get behind.
faded paint is a bad reflection on the whole town.
whatever happened to giving up? - When standards slip, families flee...
and in comes the seedy crowd. You got trouble, my friends.
right here in River City.
this is not funny, Lorelai. - Does anyone want anything?
Yes, I do. I want to know why you won't paint this place.
it's a pain. I'd have to close for a day, which I can't afford, or paint it at night...
which I don't want to do because I hate painting.
how about this?
I'll help you. I love to paint. - You do?
Yes, I do. - You love it?
I want to marry it. - You have strange passions.
she likes washing dishes, too. She's multifaceted abnormal.
come on. We'll drink a couple of beers, sing painting songs.
painting songs? - Yeah, painting songs.
like, you know, the song that goes:
grab your brush and grab your rollers
all you kids and all you bowlers
we're going paintin' today
say yes, or there's another verse.
I guess maybe if I had help.
Really? Oh, my God, that's wonderful! - Taylor, it's not for you. It's for me.
I can't wait to tell the rest of the committee. They won't believe this.
I hate that he's pleased.
you'll drop a gum wrapper in the street in front of his store later.
Yeah, good idea.
kick-ass wine.
how poetic. - It's got a nice smell. Earthy, vibrant.
you can taste the Italian's feet. - It's a Bordeaux. It's French.
what's an Italian's foot doing in a French wine?
so when do you guys leave for Martha's Vineyard?
we're not going to Martha's Vineyard this year.
why not?
our usual rental wasn't available when we inquired... late.
we should have just bought a place years ago, like I wanted.
it wouldn't have been prudent.
now we have no place to go next week. - You could always go somewhere else.
we always go to the Vineyard at this time of year.
you could break the chain, Dad.
go to Paris. - Yes, Paris.
impressionism, poodles... - Creme brulee.
that's great. - Impossible.
pourquoi? French.
we only go to Europe in the fall.
I heard a rumor Europe's still there in spring.
I heard it, too. - We know it's there in the spring.
but we never go there because we always go in the fall.
it's getting a bit too Lewis Carroll for me.
what is so interesting about Europe in the spring?
spring vegetables.
you want us to go to Europe to eat a vegetable?
no, I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff.
there's festivals and, you know, Europe. - In the fall.
it costs a fortune to travel first-class in Europe.
we only do it every two years. - In the fall.
it's just not in the budget this year. - You don't have to fly first class.
cause there's always coach.
or business class is slightly less. There's deals on the Internet.
pass the potatoes. - You got it.
Catherine the Great, 1729 to'96.
empress of Russia, 1762 to '96.' - Hold still, please.
originally named Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst.'
but everybody called her Kitten.
married to Grand Duke Peter of Holstein in 1754.'
Rory, seriously... - 'The marriage was an unhappy one.'
there were way too many names.
lady with notecards, look at lady with needle and focus...
so I can sew the button on your sweater and not on my thumb.
I'm sorry.
I'll get it.
you're 4 years old.
Hiya, baby doll. - Hi, Babbette.
you want some coffee?
no, I just came over to ask a big favor. - Ask away.
morey just got a call to play a gig at the Village Vanguard tonight...
so we gotta go to New York. - Wow!
cream? - And sugar. Thanks.
anyway, yesterday Morey and I finally broke down...
and we got ourselves a new baby.
honey, you got a kitten. Good for you.
what's its name? - Apricot. He's just the cutest thing.
but he's so teeny. There's no way he can go with us...
and I would hate for him to stay alone in the house.
so I was thinking maybe Rory could come over and house-sits for the evening.
I'd love to. - Great.
we got a kitchen full of food, and Morey got cable...
so you can watch those four girls talking dirty if you want to.
sounds good. - You're an angel.
both of you, angels. You have a key? - We got it covered.
great, l' ll leave you the number of where we're staying.
have a good time. We'll be back tomorrow.
I love you crazy girls. - Bye!
I can't believe how fast you agreed to spend the night away from me.
you're crazy. I'm doing her a favor.
sure you are.
that's okay. Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine.
I'd like to debate you on that, but l' m late for the bus.
this is only the second night we've ever spent apart.
doesn't that make you sad? - Yeah, but l' ll get over it.
paul and Linda McCartney only spent 11 nights apart their entire relationship.
did you know that? - I did not know that.
they were truly devoted to each other.
being apart was too painful to even talk about.
I understand.
I don't think Linda would've even considered cat-sitting without Paul.
mom, when I go off to college, l' m gonna be gone every night.
what will you do then? - I will go with you.
I'll sleep on the floor in your dorm, next to your bed.
at least you've got a plan. - Yes.
perhaps you'd like to take a picture of me with you tonight.
in case you get Ionely, you can talk to it. - Bye.
carry your bird, miss? - Hi, I didn't expect to see you here.
I just wanted to say hello.
so, who's your friend? - Homework.
Really?
we will be cohabitating for the next month so I can examine its every move.
jealous? - I'll get over it.
I'm house-sitting tonight for Babbette, and I was thinking...
maybe if the right offer came along, I might be up to some company.
I'm offering. - I'm accepting.
good. - You wanna get some coffee?
I can't. I have to get to work.
I thought you go to work at 5: 00. - No, 4: 00 on Thursdays.
for some reason, Thursday's always really busy.
lots of oppressed housewives shopping for their husbands' dinner.
Wow. - What?
that was a little pointed.
what are you talking about? - The crack about the housewives...
shopping for their husbands' dinner. - Come on, it was a joke.
it was a pretty weird joke to hear coming out of your mouth.
you are so sensitive about the whole Donna Reed thing.
I'm not sensitive about it. I just find it ridiculous.
Why? - What do you mean, why?
so she cooked a lot. - A lot?
she made homemade doughnuts, chocolate cake...
a lamb chop-mashed potato dinner...
and enough stew to feed Cambodia all in one episode.
so what? - You really like that concept, don't you?
no, I... Yeah, sort of.
Oh, my God. - It's a little over the top...
but the general idea of a wife cooking dinner for her family...
that's nice. Why is that not nice?
it's not just that.
it's the having to have the dinner on the table as soon as the husband gets home...
and having to look perfect to do housework...
and the whole concept that her one point in life is to serve somebody else.
Yes, but maybe there are two points of view here.
I don't think so.
you feel that way because your mother feels that way.
so I have no opinions of my own? - I didn't mean that.
if I have no opinions of my own, then l' d be just the kind of girl you like.
my mom made dinner for my dad every day before she started working.
now she even does it on the weekends. What does that say about her?
it says she has a choice and Donna Reed didn't.
you do realize that Donna Reed wasn't real.
I know that, but she represented millions of women that were real...
and did have to dress and act like that...
please tell me how we began arguing about The Donna Reed Show.
I don't know.
look, I gotta go to work, so...
Bye. - Dean?
what? - Bird.
good, l' m just about to leave. - Where are you going?
to Luke's. We're picking out paint colors tonight...
so it's gonna be hours of 'yes, no, yes, no'...
until my famous perseverance wears him down...
and he ends up in a ball on the floor crying like a girl.
wanna come watch? - I'm house-sitting, remember?
Yeah, but you have to eat. Come have a burger.
no, thanks.
what is that? - It's for school.
he's so cute. What's his name? - Case Study Number 12.
is that hyphenated?
honey, he's adorable. He should have a name.
I'm not bonding with my midterm, thank you.
all right, l' ll name him. Hi, your name is Stanley. Hi, Stanley.
it's a girl.
sorry about the Stanley thing. Your name is Stella.
Stella's nice, and she was married to Stanley.
call it whatever you want.
you're grumpy. What happened? - Nothing, just a long day.
you know what the remedy is?
a ringside seat while Luke envisions strangling me with his baseball cap.
I'll leave the chick here tonight so the kitten doesn't get any fancy ideas.
she's been fed. If she gets too loud, put her in my room.
I'll call you later. - Okay.
are you okay? - Yeah. Just a bad afternoon. I'll fix it.
call me if you need a wrench or something.
I will.
now, this is another way to go.
sort of a French bistro kind of a look.
this isn't a French bistro. - Really?
it's amazing what you learn when you listen.
which you usually don't.
then I don't have useless information intruding in my brain.
thank God.
if you wanted to do more warm, golden Tuscan countryside...
then l' d go to Italy. Here, l' ll wrap this.
we could also go with...
a pastelly English-country-garden theme.
maybe we could add stenciling on the ceiling.
no stenciling. - Do you even know what stenciling is?
does Martha Stewart do it? - Yes.
no stenciling.
ask him. - I will.
go on. - Don't push.
hello Luke. - What do you want, Kirk?
Taylor tells me you're thinking of painting this place.
that's right. He is.
excuse me, l' d like to hear it from him.
Luke, is that true? - Yes, Kirk, it is true.
Really? - Yes.
this is your final decision? - Yes, it is.
cause it's not too late... - You heard him.
he's painting this place. Pay up.
thank you.
sorry, man. - It's a little late for that, don't you think?
I like this.
okay, I get it.
hold on.
meow if you need anything else.
Hi, is Dean in? This is Rory.
will you tell him I called? Okay, thanks.
you ready to talk paint? - No.
good. I've got all the choices set up...
and while any one of them would work...
I think this combo is currently my favorite.
see? Imagine, this will be for the walls, this will be for the trim...
the edging around the doors and the windows.
I know what the trim is. - Okay.
the colors are quite similar to what you have here now...
but they're a little richer, a little warmer.
what do you think? Wait, wait.
a little ambience? - This is a diner. We don't do ambience.
one argument at a time. So what do you think?
honestly? I have no idea. Do you like it?
Yeah. - Okay.
good.
what are you doing?
the Town Council wanted to do a before-and-after poster.
out. - Bye.
that's it. We're closed for the night.
since you have to take everything off the walls anyway...
now is a good time to decide...
what stuff you'll keep and what stuff you'll get rid of.
everything stays. - Okay.
there is a plastic dancing pork chop that says...
everything stays.
...I lost my head over a good chop. You should, too.'
everything stays. - Okay, everything stays.
this place hasn't been painted since my dad was alive.
no, I didn't know that. - He painted it before he opened it...
and once more when the roof caved in one winter.
I think that's probably it. - The paint lasted a long time.
he got his money's worth. - Yeah.
he really loved this place, you know?
the store was his life. Mine, too, I guess.
I spent every minute I wasn't in school in here.
I spent a lot of minutes I was supposed to be in school.
but why a diner? Why didn't you keep it a hardware store?
I didn't love the hardware business the way my dad did...
and I knew how to cook, so I thought a diner would be more...
fun. - That's a hard word for you to say.
I just always wanted to work here.
just where Dad did. - God, that's nice...
to be so, I don't know, connected to your dad.
I would have loved that. - You've got that with Rory.
Yeah, I guess so.
I still think there's a spot on the wall somewhere...
where my dad took an order one day when he ran out of paper.
Really? Where? - I don't know.
behind the counter maybe.
next to the door.
on the right side.
here it is.
three hammers, Phillips-head screwdriver.
three boxes of nails in assorted sizes.
I've seen it from time to time.
I guess it is time for a little spruce.
Yeah, it is.
but let's not spruce this particular spot.
that sounds good. - Okay.
jeez. - No, don't get up.
if I don't... - They'll go away, trust me.
they should be in there.
anyway, just imagine it all in pastels. The whole thing.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I should go. - Oh, yeah.
it's gonna be great. - I'm sure it is.
see you. - See you.
how's it going? - Very well.
I have discovered that, in addition to my lameness in geometry...
I also will not become a biologist, French translator, or Civil War buff.
I guess that leaves bass player for the Foo Fighters.
I also wouldn't rule out keyboardist in the Siouxsie and the Banshees reunion tour.
I like that you keep an open mind.
so, what's up? - I need to borrow a CD.
which one? - The weird one.
I need more information.
I don't know which one it is, but if I saw it, l' d know.
okay, let's have a look.
okay, we have classic rock, progressive rock, pretty-boy rock...
excuse me?
bon Jovi, Duran Duran, The Wallflowers, Bush...
got it. Next?
punk, new wave, German metal bands...
Broadway soundtracks. - Interesting filing system.
anything yet? - Nope, sorry.
over there, we have jazz, jazz vocals, classical, country...
rockabilly, Sinatra, The Capitol Years. Oh, wait.
the miscellaneous section. - That sounds right.
is this the one where he sings Tambourine Man?
and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
remind me to get this for my mom for her birthday.
Oh, wait. That's it.
can I? - Take it.
Thanks. - So, what are you doing?
I'm not completely sure yet. - Okay, I want details.
Oh, no.
do something. Show yourself.
molt, or chirp, or something.
this is so not funny. Not funny.
this is unbelievable. All day long, just chirps like a maniac...
at the top of her lungs. And now, nothing. Silence.
Marcel Marceau chicken.
that's okay. I can fix this. We can fix this.
I'm going to make this better.
I'm going to fix...
Hello? - Yeah?
Stella got out, and I don't know... Do I put seed on the floor...
do I make cheeping sounds, or do I pull a Lucy Ricardo...
and walk like a chicken so she thinks l' m her mother?
who is this? - What do you mean? It's Lorelai.
who else would call you looking for her chick?
you're right. I'm the idiot. Go on.
could you come over here, please, and help me?
Yeah, okay. I'll be right over.
okay, hurry.
thank God. Get in here.
this place is a disaster. What's going on?
okay, the last sighting was here, by the InStyle magazine.
but then she burrowed through the Glamour, jumped over the Cosmo...
and knocked over a bottle of nail polish.
so if there was any doubt that this chick was a girl...
there isn't anymore.
okay, there she is. - Jeez, what was that?
you really do have a chick loose in here. - Yeah, I told you.
there she goes by the kitchen!
don't step on her! - She cut right in front of me.
she's being graded, so don't squash her.
tell her to watch where she's going.
Hello?
I wasn't sure if you still wanted me to come over.
I do, I absolutely do. - Are you sure?
Yeah, l' m totally and completely...
you're teasing me. - Yeah, a little.
but I did appreciate the enthusiasm.
so how long until you get here? - Actually, not long at all.
Why? Where are you? - Right outside.
what the... - Honey, you're home.
say something.
trick or treat?
what, you don't like it? - No, I do.
it's got a large circumference.
thank you. Now come on in. It's cold outside.
Oh, my God.
here, let me take your coat.
thank you. - You're welcome.
interesting music. - I'm glad you like it.
so what's that? - Just some appetizers before dinner.
before dinner? - Yes.
are we going out? - No.
ordering pizza? - Nope.
so... - I made you dinner.
excuse me? - Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes...
you made me dinner? - That's right.
you made me dinner? - And dessert.
okay, what is going on here? - I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious.
it's Donna Reed night.
I swear she went over there. - We looked over there.
she went under that chair and didn't come out.
we moved the chair, we searched the floor. Nothing.
then she went through a hole in the floor. - There's no hole in the floor.
maybe there was a hole, and she crawled through it and fixed it.
then she's a super-intelligent chick with great physical and deductive skills.
this is not a chick I wanna find.
Hey, Luke, what did you mean earlier? - What are you talking about?
when you got here, you made some comment...
about me not really having a chick in the house.
I mean, if I didn't have a chick here, why did you think I was calling?
no, I thought you were calling about the chick.
it didn't seem like it. - Maybe it didn't seem like it, but it was.
was what?
was what I... thought. Can we just keep looking?
okay.
I just still think... - There she is.
where? - There.
careful.
well?
what can I say? - You can say it's perfect.
it's perfect. - Thank you.
how is it really?
it's perfect. - Yeah?
it's amazing. I've never had anyone make dinner for me before.
except my mom, and believe me, it's not the same.
I'm extremely glad to hear that.
wait. You wanna save room for dessert, right?
that's right. So, what's for dessert?
lime Fantasy Supreme.
which is...
green Jell-O and Cool Whip. - You are insane.
Oh, no. I forgot to make the rolls.
what? - I was gonna make rolls.
that's okay. - I can't believe I forgot them.
what are you doing? - I'll make them now.
hold on. Come on.
we really don't need rolls.
Donna Reed would have never forgotten the rolls.
they're gonna make me turn in my pearls.
I promise l' ll kick anyone's butt who comes near those pearls.
as really amazing as this whole thing was...
I mean, the music, the outfit, the dinner...
I hope you know that I don't expect you to be Donna Reed.
and I don't want you to be Donna Reed. That's not what I meant.
this just totally got blown out of proportion.
I'm actually pretty happy with you.
I know and I appreciate that, but aside from this actually being fun...
I did a little research on Donna Reed.
you did research on Donna Reed? - Look.
she did do the whole milk and cookies, wholesome, big-skirt thing.
but aside from that...
she was an uncredited producer and director on her television show...
which made her one of the first woman TV executives...
which is actually pretty impressive.
I'm glad this turned out to be such a positive experience for you.
it has been.
and though l' ll probably never get the feeling back in my little toe...
l' d do it again. - Yeah?
someday. But for now, I better get these dishes cleaned up.
I'll help.
sorry, you're a man. You can't help for another 15 years.
okay, then as the man, I will do what the man is supposed to do.
go bowling? - Take out the trash.
she's never going anywhere ever again.
I think l' ll put Superglue on the bottom of the cage.
that would be bad, right? I know staples are bad...
but what's the verdict on Superglue? - Ask Stella.
you don't have to do that.
this stuff is sharp. I wanna get it out of the way.
thanks for helping. - No problem.
I'm gonna throw this stuff outside.
what are you doing here? - What are you doing?
you first. - I'm looking for a chick.
Yeah, me, too. - You are not.
neither are you.
Hey, Luke, is there...
fancy meeting you here. - Yeah.
the Jell-O's doing this weird melted thing and I...
mom, Luke.
what the hell are you two doing? - Nothing, she...
we ate dinner. Steak and beans...
canned, not fresh.
and potatoes. - From a box.
but they were still good.
thank you. - You're welcome.
what were you guys doing?
I was in the house.
and the lamp sort of... l' m gonna get going. I'm sorry about the...
forget it. - Okay, bye.
Yeah, l' d probably better go, too.
thanks for dinner. - You're welcome.
what?
okay, you're 16, you have a whole house to yourself for the evening.
I expect you're gonna have your boyfriend over.
but what is with the apron?
it's a long story. - Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?
I gotta go check on Apricot.
Oh, my God. I just saw the pearls. - I'm going in now.
I'm going inside, too, because I have to write down...
how l' m gonna torture you about that outfit.
good night. - Could I get a picture though?
because visual aids would really help. The shoes. I'm dying.
mom, I can't find Apricot! - What? No.
she was on the couch when I came out, and now nowhere.
that's it! We are not animal people, period.
it was a tiny little favor.
we have had this discussion before. - You are being unreasonable.
I have my standards. - But this is a simple request.
you are asking me to compromise my artistic and culinary values.
michel wanted an egg-white omelet? - Yes.
crazy man. - Why am I a crazy man?
I had no time for breakfast today.
so I nicely asked her to make me an egg-white omelet...
with some tomatoes, mushroom, a little chives, and she gives me this.
what is this? - A three-egg omelet...
with goat cheese, pancetta, cooked in a sherry olive oil.
I don't eat dairy or meat. You know this.
I am a chef, Michel. It is my job to make food that tastes good.
and you do. - But I can't eat like that and look like her.
you don't know what you're missing. - That' ll kill you.
you gotta go someday. - Someday, this will catch up to you.
you'll become the balloon lady, and with the luck of God, I will be here to enjoy it.
you make a good egg-white omelet. - I know.
who wants to hear about my night? - Oh, me.
it started with Rory's baby chick getting loose in the house...
and ended with Rory and I up at 1: 00 in the morning...
Iooking for Babbette's new kitten, who we found asleep in the piano.
wow, that's very Wild Kingdom of you. - I'm the Marlin Perkins of Stars Hollow.
you want some coffee? - Please.
so, how's Rory's chick? - Better than my lemon lamp.
what's wrong with your lemon lamp? - Luke killed it.
on purpose? - I can't prove it, but I will.
what was Luke doing there?
I called him when I got home and Stella wasn't there.
Stella is the chick? - Yes.
I like that name. - Yeah, Streetcar Named Desire.
Vivien Leigh or Jessica Tandy? - Hello! Tandy.
of course, continue.
so I evaluated the situation in my usual calm, cool, collected manner...
and then I called Luke to help me track her down.
that's when he broke the lamp? - He's not very graceful.
he said the weirdest thing. - 'May I break your lamp?'
he got there and I was looking for Stella...
and he said, 'You really have a baby chick loose in the house.'
like I made that up or... I don't know.
well. - Well what?
you call someone and say, 'Can you come and help me look for my loose chick?'
it's a little... - A little what?
it sounds like a code for, 'l' m not wearing any underwear.'
that's not the code for, 'l' m not wearing any underwear.'
Sookie, you're not serious.
look, the first time Jackson and I... - Yeah.
I called him up and told him I had a bat in my attic.
honey, you do have a bat in your attic.
so he came over and we went in the attic...
and we both knew there was no bat, but we pretended to look for it.
then when we couldn't find the bat...
we went downstairs and had a bottle of wine and...
so you're saying Luke thought I made up a crazy story...
about having some chick loose in the house just to get him in bed?
not to get him in bed. Maybe he thought you wanted to see him...
and didn't know how to say it. - That's nuts.
a woman asking a man to come over late at night to her house. Come on.
Yeah, but this is Luke we're talking about.
why did you call him? - Because I needed help.
why didn't you call me? - I assumed you'd be with Jackson.
I did. - Why didn't you call Rory?
she'd have been furious to know Stella was lost.
why didn't you call Patty? She raises chickens.
or Andrew? He lives around the corner, doesn't he?
what is your point? - My point is that you called Luke.
out of all the people you could have called...
that would have come and dropped what they were doing, you called Luke.
because I had just been with him. We were picking out paint samples.
he was on my mind. It was purely a timing thing.
picking out paint samples? - Yes.
for Luke's place? - Yes.
so you could paint together? - Once again, yes.
which, I believe, was your idea.
so now the fact that I suggested painting Luke's diner...
also means that I wanted to get him in bed.
suddenly l' m trying to get any poor, unsuspecting person in bed with me.
I'm like Michael Douglas.
Lorelai, this... - I just... Thanks for the omelet.
no, honey, l 'm sorry. Don't be mad at me.
I'm not mad. I'm tired. - Okay.
you know, Luke is a really nice man.
Bye, Sookie.
we thought the doorbell wasn't working. - Come in.
we were ringing it and ringing it, and nobody...
I guess we'll just come in.
that' d be the same as what we were paying for our old place?
exactly the same.
except for the grounds fees. - The grounds fee is higher.
but the grounds are larger. - I'm just trying to get all the information.
all the information...
is that this is our last chance to go to Martha's Vineyard for the season.
I realize the position we are in, but this is a business transaction.
for heaven's sake.
as a business transaction...
one in which money goes out and we receive goods and services...
and he's patronizing me. How lovely.
I must treat this conversation with the same care and devotion to detail...
I wish any conversation that would be considered a business transaction.
kindly allow me to do so.
Richard, Emily, please. - Goodness, you startled me.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say l' m sure we could negotiate the grounds fee.
that' ll be fine.
good. I'll get into this right now and get back to you.
thank you, John. - Yes, we'll talk to you later.
Bye.
careful, Richard.
that canary you ate is going to spoil your dinner.
what's going on?
your mom and I secured a place on Martha's Vineyard.
that's great! - I thought you lost your old place.
we did, but this afternoon we found out that Arthur Roundtree had died.
he'd been drinking.
so we got on the phone and snatched that place up.
it's a fine piece of property. - Much better view than our usual place.
both of you are going to hell. I hope you know that.
at least we'll be well-rested.
Touche.
I am so thrilled about this. - I'm glad.
the two of you must come up for the weekend. It is so lovely.
Rory would just love it. - Can we go for a weekend?
we'll see how much Valium Aunty Sookie can lend me.
the only drawback is that we had to rent the place furnished...
and Arthur had dreadful taste. Remember the library, Richard?
pink and green. It was just horrible.
he's dead now, so he got his. - Lorelai, you're being morbid.
I'm being morbid? - New subject, please.
Joan and Melissa Rivers here think l' m being morbid.
Rory, what's new in your life? - Nothing. Just school, homework.
aprons. - Do not go there.
what does she mean? - Nothing, I was just teasing her.
about aprons? - Yeah.
I don't understand. - It's not important.
then humor me.
nothing. Rory dressed up in a cute apron the other day.
I was teasing her about it.
why did you get dressed up in an apron?
we've decided to give up on that pesky Harvard dream...
and focus on something more realistic.
mom, Dad, Rory's decided to become a maid, just like I was.
is that funny? Did she think it was funny?
what made you say such a thing? - And in front of Rory?
I was kidding. - God, my heart stopped.
why don't you tell them about your bird? That's a safe subject.
your bird? - Yeah, it's for school.
each of us has to follow a chick through its growth process.
everything must be logged. Eating and sleeping habits.
Houdini habits.
she got out. - She ran far.
but she lived. - She's a better bird for it.
thank God Luke found her. - Luke found her?
what? - Rory said Luke found her.
getting me back for the apron thing?
did the bird get loose in Luke's diner? - No, the bird got loose at home.
your home? - Yes.
so, Grandpa, when's your next trip? - Madrid, the twelfth.
there's a nice edition of Cervantes in it for you.
gracias.
what was Luke doing at your house? - Look, there's no ice. I'll get some.
I asked you a question. - He was helping me find the bird, Mom.
Really? - Yes, really.
and how did he know the bird was missing?
was he strolling by your house and he heard your plaintive cries for help?
or the helpless cheep of a chick in trouble?
I called him, Mom, okay?
I called him and asked him to come over and help me find the bird, okay?
this man is always around when you're in trouble.
he's a good friend. - Please.
do we have to discuss this? - I'm getting a little tired of being lied to.
apparently we do.
this man was at Rory's birthday party. He came to the hospital with you.
he's the male lead in every story you tell. You go to the diner every single day.
I've seen how he looks at you, the way you look at him. I'm not a fool.
mom, please.
why do you treat me like I don't have a clue as to what is going on in your life?
now l' m asking you, as a favor...
if you have any respect for me at all as your mother, just tell me.
do you have feelings for this man?
I don't know.
maybe I do. I haven't given it that much thought.
maybe I do.
thank you. I'm glad you were finally honest with me.
now we can discuss what on earth you could possibly be thinking.
don't forget the ice.
so you're sure we need this many cans?
Yeah, you need enough for two coats, touch ups and little spots.
no, l' m not sure.
we got the paint, the brushes...
the tarps, and all the other stuff the paint guy said we'd need.
so I guess we're ready. - Yes, we are.
the only thing left to do is figure out when.
how about Friday? - Friday?
you don't want this lying around. I don't know if paint goes bad.
but judging by the smell when it's fresh, rotten paint would be gross.
don't you meet your folks on Friday?
Yeah, but I can get out early for a special occasion.
friday it is. - Good.
Hey. - Hey, you.
jeez, you think you got enough paint? - I know, I tried to tell him.
so dinner. Thoughts? - Let's have some.
how about Chinese? - Sounds good.
I need to stop at the market and get fruit.
Why? - I think l' m getting scurvy.
Really? - Yeah.
that or a cold. But, either way, I need some fruit.
damn motorcycles. They're a scourge. - Yeah.
they're loud. They're dangerous. We should ban them from town.
maybe we should set up barricades...
and ban all unwelcome strangers from crossing the border.
no, we couldn't do that. That would be illegal.
darn laws. - Gotta get away from that noise.
kill me and bury me with that bike. - What is it, a Harley?
that is a 2000 Indian 80 horsepower...
five-speed, close-ratio Andrews transmission. I wanna get one.
no. - Why not?
you'd die. - Oh, that.
Hi. - Nice shirt. Take it off.
dad!
this is great! What are you doing here? - I' m here to see you.
and your mom, who's not saying anything about as loud as a person can.
hello. - A word.
perhaps there's a phrase in my future.
okay, why is that man staring at me?
that's Taylor Doose. He owns the market. He knows all and sees all.
so, what's with the just showing up, Mr. Spontaneity Guy?
my folks are in Connecticut, so l' m here to see them.
on the way I thought l' d stop by and surprise the Gilmore girls.
are you surprised?
the teeniest feather could knock me in the gutter.
where would somebody find a place to stay here?
you're staying? - I'm thinking about it.
stay with us. - Sweetie.
I don't think your mom wants...
no, it's not that. It's just that l' m still surprised.
mom, please?
why not stay with us for a couple of days?
Thanks. You won't even know l' m there.
I really miss you.
do you want to come in?
Rory. - Yeah?
I love you. - I...
so I guess my coming here was probably a bad idea.
probably.
please, don't be mad.
Why? Because I say I love you and you wanna think about it?
screw this!
so then he starts ripping my $20 bill into a million pieces.
and I'm thinking, 'There's a store full of people.
why am I the one on line with the crazy magician?'
I'll cut to the end.
he couldn't put it back together and had to pay me back in quarters.
very good story. - You look tired.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately. - How come?
I just have a lot on my mind. - Anything I can do?
flag down the coffee. - Arm going up now.
honey, you gotta wake up.
wanna play?
one, two, three? - I'll go first.
and one.
pass. - Why?
because I'm not Anna Nicole Smith. Next.
two. - Pass.
Why? - Because I'm not Mary Kay Letourneau.
okay.
what are you looking for? - My new husband.
she's already passed up two good prospects.
but I'm feeling good about number three. - Do I want to know?
Luke came to the table. Is he number three?
no. - You don't know what we're doing.
the safest answer in anything involving both of you is no.
we're playing 'One, two, three, he's yours. '
I didn't ask. - You can take the first guy that walks by.
or if you to pass, assuming there's a better one, you can take the next guy.
if you don't take him, you're automatically stuck with the third guy.
got it? - I'm not playing.
of course not. It's still my turn.
guy number three is crossing the street right now.
why am I looking? - Because it's like a train wreck.
Oh, no! - Daddy.
not Kirk. - Maybe he'll buy me a pony.
I wanna go back to the old guy.
congratulations, man. - Thank you.
what? - Nothing.
okay, did someone put the 'kick me' sign on my back again?
it wasn't funny last week and it's not funny now.
I have asthma.
mom, look, he's leaving. - No, Kirk, come back, I love you. Drat!
all right, your turn.
I don't know. You already got Kirk. How's a girl to top that?
you're right. He's yours.
and one...
okay, so, we should order.
Yeah, ordering' s good.
independence Inn. Michel speaking. - Yes, is Ms. Gilmore there?
I'm sorry, she's busy. How may I assist you?
actually, I need to talk to Ms. Gilmore.
is this business or personal? - Personal.
is anybody there? Hello?
Yes, hello? Hi?
is this a bad time? - No such thing. Where are you?
I am in the teachers' lounge.
what are you wearing? - Nothing.
you must be very popular. - And chilly.
we had a chat date tonight. - I was thinking about something...
and I wanted to run it by you. - Okay.
so... - Make a gorilla sound.
Why? - I wanna play Wild Kingdom.
I am not making a gorilla sound.
I'll tell you what color underwear I'm wearing.
had you considering the gorilla sound, didn't I?
Yep. - I'm good.
okay, I need you to be serious now.
says the man with no pants.
we have been having these very successful phone calls for a couple of weeks now. - Yes, we have.
I think that all the talking has done us a lot of good.
Yes, it has.
so I was thinking that maybe this weekend, instead of a phone call...
we should have a date. Let's have dinner.
in the same restaurant? - At the same table.
interesting idea. - I think it's time.
you know what? So do I.
Saturday night? 8: 00? - Okay. Wear some pants.
I make no promises. - Bye.
salt and vinegar. - Thank you.
here's your gum, soda, New Yorker, and dental floss.
they didn't have the minty kind? - They were out.
well, this is good, too.
he wasn't in there. - What?
Dean. He wasn't in there.
in case you were wondering. - I wasn't.
I just thought you might be. So I mentioned it.
well, I'm not. - Okay.
I thought you'd like to note for future reference...
that he's not in the store on Wednesdays.
you can mark it on that list you're hiding...
that says where he is so you can avoid him at anytime.
I wasn't avoiding the market. - My mistake.
I wasn't. - Okay.
so, what are you doing tonight?
well, homework, and then homework...
and if I get all that done in time, some homework. You?
I have to meet my science partner.
fun. - Yes, science is fun.
I'll call you later? - Okay.
Hey, Lane? - Yeah?
you sure he wasn't in there? - I asked.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
shopping? - I had a couple of things to pick up.
at the Cat Club? - Yeah.
at the Cat Club? - Yeah, I did, okay?
okay. I just never took you for a cat lover or a 97-year-old woman.
what' d you buy? - Nothing.
but you got a bag there. - I know.
it's got a cat paw stamped on it and a catnip bow. Wise man.
wow, potholders. - Yes.
little kitty potholders.
they meow. - It's a present.
for someone you hate? - It's Rachel's birthday.
don't say anything. She doesn't want anyone to know. She hates birthdays.
not as much as she'll hate the potholders. - I don't know how to buy gifts.
I don't like to buy gifts. I don't like getting gifts.
this whole gift-giving-and-getting process is completely insane.
the rant begins. - Suddenly, on a certain date...
the level of my affection for a person...
isn't measured by the way I treat them or what we share.
just because I didn't buy her furry slippers or a giant shoetree...
all of a sudden, I suck. - Luke, stop.
you know, you cannot give her these potholders.
I know.
go to the mall, walk around a little. - No malls. I hate malls.
rant number two.
they underpay employees and overprice merchandise.
they contribute to urban sprawl. They encourage materialism.
the parking's a horror. You drive in, you pay a buck.
even if you're only there for five... - Okay, Emma Goldman, I'll tell you what.
I'll go for you. - You're gonna shop for me?
I have the day off tomorrow. I was gonna go anyway.
you're serious? - I'll get a bunch of stuff, all returnable.
I'll bring it, you pick what you want, and the rest I'll return.
I'll do the work. All you have to do is point.
one finger. Preferably, your index. - I don't know.
it's the first special occasion you both have shared since she's been back.
don't you wanna give something nice? - I am taking her out to dinner.
Yeah, I know. I gotta get her something nice.
so then let me help.
all right. Thank you. - You're welcome.
nothing too 'out there,' okay? She's not into all that trendy stuff.
she likes simple, clean nature. Elephants, candles, okay?
if you can find a candle shaped like an elephant...
okay, you know what? I've got it all under control.
okay, thanks. - Get rid of these.
Hello? Lane, are you here?
Jeez!
who are you? Why you call Lane? How you know Lane? You date her?
you try to? - No.
then why are you here? Empty your pockets.
okay, I'm gonna go now. - Dean, wait.
who's Dean? - I'm Dean.
how you know him? - We go to school together.
you do? - Yeah, we're science partners.
you don't talk! - Sorry.
science partners?
Yes, I invited him over to work. - Work?
on our science project. - Reproduction?
spores, molds, and fungus.
science project? - Yes.
for school? - Yes.
you're not dating? - No.
okay. Follow me.
you, sit here! You, sit here!
I'm going over there.
when I come back, these chairs will be in same place.
no moving. You understand? - Yes, Mamma.
not you, him. - Yes, I understand.
I see all.
so that's your mom? - That's my mom.
has she seen Patton? - She gets uptight about boys.
I sensed that. - It's nothing personal.
I'm sure once she gets to know me, she'll...
no, she'll hate you forever. It's just nothing personal.
we should probably get started.
chapter 12? - Sounds good.
is this weird for you? - A little.
me, too.
I didn't know if Rory told you to hate me or something.
that's not Rory. - Yeah, I know.
how is she? - Good.
Goodish. Less 'good' than 'ish. '
yeah? How much less?
we're breaking our agreement. - What agreement?
our agreement not to talk about Rory.
we didn't have an agreement not to talk about Rory.
it was an unspoken agreement.
it was really unspoken 'cause nobody spoke it.
if we have to study together, it would be better if we didn't discuss Rory.
fine.
she can't go in to the market. - Why not?
because you're there. - Not on Wednesdays.
already noted.
can I ask you a really personal question?
you can ask. I might not answer.
do you think you and Rory will ever get back together?
I vote we go back to the 'no talking about Rory' agreement.
look, I'm just saying that I...
I should have called. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. - It doesn't matter.
I didn't think you'd want to know. - I got it.
Rory, stop. Okay, that's the opposite of 'stop. '
forget it. You didn't tell me. Now I know. Life goes on.
don't be mad. - I'm fine. I have to go.
time to get up.
Hey, I have a huge dilemma that I need your opinion on.
what?
am I more beautiful today than I was yesterday?
Oh, boy.
I'm not sure. At first I looked in the mirror and thought:
well, yes. Definitely a huge improvement. '
can I have my pillow back?
but then I thought maybe it's not that I'm more beautiful today.
maybe I was as beautiful yesterday. Only, I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.
I'm gonna take a shower.
hurry up and I'll drive you to school. - No, thanks.
why so charming this morning?
I had an annoying visit from the Stars Hollow wake-up fairy.
Where's my tie? - In your drawer.
I'm looking in the drawer. - Check the living room.
why would it be in the living room?
because it's been seeing the doily on the coffee table.
sorry, I did not want you to find out this way.
don't take this personally, but get out.
okay, you're crabby.
do you know what the perfect cure for crabbiness is?
a fabulous trip to the mall.
what do you say? You can blow off school and come with me.
we can shop, go to the movies, maybe talk a little.
no, thanks. - Come on, it might make you feel better.
I feel fine, and I don't wanna shop.
I know you've been in a funk over Dean, but you have to try not to dwell on it.
I'm gonna be late for school.
okay. Then just meet me in town around 4: 00.
we'll get some Indian food and spoil our dinner.
whatever. - Hey, love the enthusiasm.
does Up With People know about you?
Luke's. Yeah, hang on.
okay, yeah, cheeseburger, fries, well...
vanilla shake, coke. Yes, we have salad.
one salad with blue cheese, one with ranch. Got it. 20 minutes.
what the hell is this?
the results of my shopping trip, all done in two hours.
impossible. - I'm a savant.
everything's returnable? - Yes, now sit down and relax.
I'll show you what I got. - Can I have my credit card?
fine.
looks tired. - Where's Rachel?
she's out running some errands. - Good.
last week, we were talking about Meryl Streep and the accent thing.
Rachel said she loved Out of Africa, but she never read the book, remember?
no. - Okay, so I was like:
are you crazy? Isak Dinesen is amazing. I love her'...
which is crap 'cause I never read the book either.
but Rory told me it was amazing. So I felt pretty confident in my recommendation of:
out of Africa. - You bought her a book?
no, you bought her a book, to be put in her brand-new...
camera bag. - She's got a camera bag.
it's nylon. - So?
this one's leather. Beautiful leather. Feel it. Smell it.
I'm not gonna smell that bag.
don't smell it. But trust me, she's gonna love it.
her old bag is falling apart, so she was gonna get a new one.
now you'll have beaten her to it.
so it's practical. - And pretty.
that seems right. - You like?
Yeah, thanks. - Good.
what's all this? - Well, Luke...
timing is a beautiful thing. --Is it?
it is. So I'm at the mall and already found Rachel's gifts.
I've had two sugar-cinnamon pretzels.
I'm buzzed on the sugar and jazzed with the purchases.
I take a victory lap through Bloomingdale's...
and it just so happens there was an amazing sale in the men' s department.
I mean, gorgeous stuff. Look at this.
40% off! I got three different colors.
for who? - For you.
for me? - Yeah.
then, of course, beautiful pants, so soft.
I don't know what this fabric is, but I wanna have its baby.
hold on a minute. - Also, I got this fabulous belt...
to go with the sweater and pants. Simple. Black.
but look at the buckle. - I don't need a belt.
great buckle. 60% off. Can you believe it? - I can't. Look...
also, I picked up a couple of shirts...
if you didn't have a nice one to go with your suit.
what suit?
this one! - Did no one at the mall notice...
you were going through a psychotic episode?
this suit, 175% off.
you're not supposed to be shopping for me.
I thought you'd like something new to wear when you take Rachel out.
thank you, but take it back.
just try them on. - No way.
you might like how you look. - I'm fine with my clothes.
okay, see this blazer? It was 175, 000% off.
why the sudden need to dress me? - I thought you might look nice...
and since they were 600, 000% off... - No.
come on, Luke! Just try something on.
how about this sweater? - No.
how about the pants? Pretty pants! - I'm not trying anything on.
the lumberjack look will never go out. Won't it be nice not to be dressed...
like an extra in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers?
take it back. - Come on, just the jacket.
just once, be too sexy for your shirt and do a dance on the catwalk.
get away from me, you mental patient!
if we read his works in order, we can see his progression...
from a narrative of clear simplicity to one of rich complexity.
now, this is not homework. But I strongly urge you...
if you have not already read The Art of Fiction, read it.
it's a remarkable manifesto that contains basic truths...
that still apply to fiction in any form.
all right. So, Henry James, the man of the moment.
pick your book, read it carefully.
a full report on my desk one week from today. Any questions?
ms. Gilmore, any questions?
ms. Gilmore? - Yes?
did you hear the assignment? - No, I'm sorry.
Henry James. Pick your novel.
a report on my desk in one week. You got it?
Yes, I got it. - See you tomorrow.
you didn't take one note.
you resorting to the osmosis theory of learning?
why do you care? - I don't. Just making an observation.
great. We'll build a dome over you and jam a telescope in your head.
can I talk to you for a minute? - Okay.
Toodles. - Ta!
I'll get working on that dome.
so how are you? - Fine.
you seemed a little distracted today.
I didn't sleep well last night.
you've seemed to be distracted for quite a while now.
my grades are fine. - I'm not concerned about grades.
I'm concerned about you.
look, Rory, I know you've been going through kind of a tough time lately...
and I just want you to know, if you want to talk, I'm here.
tough time? - Breakups are really hard.
we've all been there.
how do you know about that? - Your mom told me.
she what? - Please, don't be upset at her.
it came out in one of our conversations. She's very concerned, frustrated...
you've been talking to my mom? - Yes.
since when? - It's been three weeks now, I guess.
are you dating? - No, not really.
I mean, we were talking about possibly this weekend, having dinner...
you didn't know anything about this, did you?
then the look on your face makes perfect sense now.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring this on you like this.
it's fine. Don't worry.
I'm sure she was gonna tell you soon. - I'm sure, too.
okay. So...
bus. - Excuse me?
if I don't go, I'm gonna miss it. - Go ahead.
thanks for the talk. - Any time.
come on! - I hate you very much.
save the sweet talk for Rachel. Get out here!
excuse me, sir, do you know where Luke is?
very funny. - My God, Luke, is that you?
I feel ridiculous.
that's because you don't have the belt on. Here.
what are you doing? - It's called accessorizing.
I can put a belt on myself, thank you. - Okay, sorry.
what? - I just...
I just have exceptional taste, is all.
turn around. - What?
I just want to make sure it all fits. Turn around.
Fabio, I need the ketchup.
can you get that guy some ketchup? - Why me?
if I spill stuff on this, I won't be able to return it.
you are not returning those clothes. - Yes, I am.
try on the suit again.
I tried it on twice. - I wanna see it with the black shirt.
I'm not wearing a black suit with a black shirt.
Regis does. - Okay, you've won me over now.
at least try on the jacket again.
is this how you like your guys, all GQ'd up?
not GQ'd up. Just a little less casual.
and you don't like casual. - I like casual fine.
just not on me. - No, it just adds variety.
it's not'let's make a new Luke.'It's let's see another side of the old one. '
you missed a loop. Come here.
what did you do?
Oh, hi. - Oh, hi.
this is not what it looks like. - It looks like you're dressing him.
then this is exactly what it looks like. - There was a sale at Bloomingdale's...
six trillion percent off. - How can you walk away from that?
I'm gonna change now.
good. I'm gonna get Rory, and just enjoy the clothes.
I will. - Okay, good. See you later, Rachel.
Bye. - Bye.
I'm gonna change. - Okay.
Hi. - Hi.
I thought you might like some coffee, since you always do.
Thanks.
so this feels very awkward.
I'm a big girl, Lane. I don't need you to protect me from things.
I didn't want to make you any sadder than you are.
how is telling me Dean is your study partner gonna make me sadder?
I don't wanna bring up his name around you.
that's crazy. - Have you seen your face...
when you mention Dean? - My face is fine.
it's not. Your face is far from fine.
I'll get over it. - You're not over it yet.
maybe I'd get over it quicker if everyone weren't so busy...
trying to protect me from all the bad, scary things in the world.
fine, I won't protect you anymore. - Great. Glad to hear it.
next time we walk down the street and you're about to walk into traffic...
I'll give you a push. - Exactly what I'm talking about.
in the spirit of not protecting you...
I was gonna tell you I couldn't study cause I had Bible class.
but that's not true. I have to meet Dean.
thanks for the honesty. - I'll have to see him again...
cause the project's due Monday. - I don't care.
I'll see you when I see you.
fine! - Fine.
Bye.
Where's Lane going? - Away.
okay, you've been in this mood for a week now...
and while I love the ups and downs of motherhood...
I gotta say, I'm tired of Goofus, and I'd like my Gallant back.
you can't say a normal sentence, right? Just 'hey, let's talk' is too dull for you.
Hey, let's talk. - About what?
wait, I know. How about you and Mr. Medina?
what? - I heard you've gotten back together again.
did you talk to Max?
he had me stay after class to talk about my breakup situation.
we are not dating. We've been talking, and we now decided to start dating.
why didn't you tell me you've been talking?
because it was so much like the Todd and Nevena Cutler thing.
what? - When I was in junior high...
I had a boyfriend, Todd something or other. Not a soul mate.
but I was crazy about him, and he dumped me.
I was completely crushed and could only lie around and cry...
and listen to Air Supply. A very low point in my life.
two days later, my best friend, Nevena Cutler...
got back with her boyfriend, Randy something...
who dumped her days before Todd dumped me.
she was so happy and gloaty...
and kept talking how great it was to have her boyfriend back...
that it made me feel horrible. - The end. Let's go.
look, I didn't want to be Nevena Cutler, okay?
you were so miserable about Dean. What was I supposed to do?
say, 'Sorry about you and Dean. But I got Max back and are we happy. '
would that be good? - That would be great.
I was going to tell you, okay?
I just wanted to give you some space and a chance to come up for air.
I was trying to protect you. That's all.
it doesn't matter if you tell me about Max or not. You'll break up again anyway.
excuse me. - That's what you do best.
stop right there.
you'll break up, cry, get back together, break up.
it doesn't really matter. I'd rather not have to keep track.
so tell me when you're down to the final inning.
that is way too snotty a thing even for alternate-universe Rory to say.
I'd like an apology. - Fine, I apologize. Let's go home.
Yeah. Let's go home and try that apology again.
what are you doing? - We need light bulbs.
we're fine. - We're in the dark. It'll take a minute.
I assume you won't come in. - Is it Wednesday?
no. - Then I can't, can I?
what does Wednesday have to do with this?
nothing. I'll meet you at home.
Rory, I'm back for round two.
I got some Silly String in case things get really ugly.
where are you?
answer, please.
this is the fourth ridiculous gathering you've dragged me to this week.
I'm the president of the board. I have to be there.
saving the Bowringenee pansy. Who's heard of such a thing?
it's a rare flower that's disappearing from the face of this earth.
who cares?
as President of the Horticultural Society, I have to care.
the last thing I need is to spend four hours being bored out of my skull...
by the same people I'll be bored by tomorrow at the Symphony Fundraiser.
we need to get your tux back from the cleaners tomorrow.
no, I'll be dead tomorrow.
I plan on flinging myself off the roof tonight...
right in the middle of Pitty Salenger's opening speech.
pitty is a dear friend, and you will be nice to her.
she is a dipsomaniac. I'm going to bring my newspaper.
you will do no such thing, Richard. Do you hear me?
Rory. - Hi, Grandma.
is everything okay? - Everything's fine.
Richard, pay the cab. - Cab? Who took a cab?
Rory did. - What's Rory doing here?
Hello, Rory. - Hi.
I don't know what she's doing here. Pay the man, and I'll find out.
for Pete's sake.
come inside.
now, tell me, what is going on?
I had a fight with Mom.
you had a fight with your mother? - I just couldn't take it anymore.
I had to get out of there. - Out of your house?
out of that house, that town, everything. I just had to go.
he tacked on an extra $5 just for waiting.
I feel like I'm back in Prague.
do you want a cocktail? - No, thanks.
Richard! - Sorry.
I'm just a little confused here. - You're all dressed up.
you were going out. I'm so sorry.
please, don't be. - It doesn't matter, Rory.
sorry. Please go out. I didn't mean to ruin your evening.
I didn't think. I should've called. - You calm down, right now.
you don't need to call before you come here. You are welcome any time.
tonight especially.
you want to talk about what happened? - Emily, don't pry.
I'm not prying. - The girl obviously needs some peace.
how do you know that? - I can tell.
you're a mind reader now. How nice.
we'll get you a turban and a booth by the train station.
would it be okay if I stay here tonight?
of course. - You can stay as long as you want.
Thanks. - Would you like some dinner?
I can get Rosa to make you something.
no, I'd just like to go to bed if that's okay. - Of course. Whatever you like.
your room's all ready. There are pajamas and a new toothbrush in the bathroom.
it's pink, with sparkles.
I thought you'd like it. - Thanks.
good night, Grandpa. - Good night, Rory.
everything's going to be fine. Richard, say something encouraging.
Rory, I'm sorry you're upset...
but I applaud your timing.
see you tomorrow.
Emily, what is all this about?
she had a fight with Lorelai.
and she came here.
Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai. Is Lane there?
do you know where she is?
that's unbelievable. You always know where she is.
the one time I need you to be crazy prison guard lady...
you're all, 'Hey, man, whatever. '
you know what? I'll never be able to explain that to your satisfaction.
so could you ask Lane to call me when she gets back? I'm looking for Rory.
no, I don't know where she is. Don't 'ha' me.
you don't know where Lane is, either.
anything?
Patty hasn't seen her but she's been working all day.
she's not at the library or at Luke's.
where is she? Why didn't she leave a note?
damn it! - Honey, calm down.
but Rory doesn't take off. She knows it'll make me crazy.
she knows it would make me worry. I'm crossing over into panic now.
no, don't cross. Come back.
you find her? - No, nothing. No one's seen her.
okay.
what about that old boyfriend of hers? - Dean.
I'm on my way.
good suggestion. You get crisis points.
Max, I'm freaking out. - It's gonna be okay.
Sookie's here, I'm here. We will find her.
I just want you to know that Rory is here with us.
what? - She arrived a few minutes ago.
she's there? Is she okay? - She's fine.
she asked to spend the night.
okay, she's there with you. So how did she get there?
she took a cab. - Let me talk to her.
she seems quite upset. She said you'd had a fight.
we had a disagreement. - She said fight.
will you put her on the phone, please, Mom?
I think we should give her time to collect herself.
thank you for your input. Can I please talk to my daughter?
she went to her room, Lorelai. - Her room is here.
mom, I'm standing here looking at her room, and she's not in it.
Lorelai, I did not come to your house and kidnap this child.
she ran from you, and she came here. She's tired, and she's upset.
I think we should just let her sleep...
and in the morning, we can argue about how to best handle the situation.
maybe some time away from each other will do you both good.
I'll pick her up in the morning.
she has school tomorrow, and her school's 10 minutes from here.
I'll pick her up after school.
why don't you call tomorrow when she gets back from school?
make sure she wants to go. You don't want to haul her back home...
just to have her jump in a cab again. - I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Goodnight, Lorelai.
so?
she's with my parents in Hartford. - Good.
good? - Bad?
bad. Very bad. - She's safe.
she's with my mother. No one is safe with my mother.
she needed some space. - No, that house is not safe.
it's like The Amityville Horror without all the good times.
if it's that bad, you should go get her. - No, she wanted to get away from me.
she wants to be alone.
let's give her her space.
you okay?
I can't believe she left me to go there.
we used to always be able to work this out.
what did you two fight about?
you? - Me?
it started with you and that I didn't tell her we were talking again...
but that was only part of it because she's been in such a bad place...
with this whole Dean thing. So I guess it was coming.
I just wish she hadn't run away.
she will be back, and you two will work everything out.
you're good at the comforting thing. - Thank you.
do you want some coffee? - Sure.
can I ask you a question? - I think you've earned it.
why didn't you tell Rory about us?
she was so upset about Dean...
I didn't think it was the best time to give her my happy news.
okay. But you've told other people?
what other people? - I don't know, friends, Sookie?
no, actually, I haven't.
any reason?
it just hasn't come up.
it hasn't? - No.
you're not avoiding talking about it, are you?
no, Max, come on.
it just seems a little strange to me. - Why is it strange?
we've been talking for at least two weeks.
I thought at some point it would've come up.
you don't say to people out of the blue, 'Max and I are talking again. '
I was just waiting for it to come up naturally.
somehow, for me, it managed to come up naturally within two days three times.
you're obviously a better people-person than I am.
if there's a reason why you don't want people to know...
then we must talk about that. - There's no reason.
are you sure? - Yes.
okay. - Do you believe me?
if you said there's no reason, there's no reason.
so you said. - So I mean.
okay. - All right.
that's fine.
I should page Sookie and tell her that Rory's okay.
that's a good idea.
good morning. - Rory, good morning.
grandma, any thoughts on where my skirt might be?
I gave it to Rosa to press. Sit down. Have some breakfast.
your skirt will be done by the time you're finished.
now, we have eggs, fruit, toast...
pancakes, and blintzes. - Anything would be fine.
what do you usually eat? - Mostly I just grab a Pop-Tart.
that sounds delicious. I'll have Rosa whip one up for you.
no, eggs would be great. - I'll go tell her.
so, Grandpa, what's new in the world today?
as usual, it's going to hell in a handbasket.
it's nice to have something you can always count on.
it is, at that.
would you like part of the paper? - Please.
your eggs will be right out. - Thanks.
so, did you sleep well? - The bed was very comfortable.
but you didn't sleep well?
no, I did. I just... - I talked to your mother last night.
I told her you'd stay here. She said she'd call this afternoon.
was she mad?
she was concerned.
so, do you get your lunch at school, or do you bring it with you?
because Rosa made a fabulous leg of lamb yesterday.
I bet it'd make a wonderful sandwich. - Take her up on that. It is good.
and demand a slice of strudel. - Okay.
I demand some strudel. - Good.
so, what's going on at school today?
I have a test in Spanish. - Are you prepared?
Yeah. I like Spanish.
biology, on the other hand...
I'm still waiting for the day...
when my knowledge of the inner workings of a frog's intestinal system...
can be applied to my work in the insurance industry.
perhaps if you were insuring the frog.
thank you.
this looks great. - Good.
thanks again for letting me stay. - It's nice having you here.
you got Grandpa to put down his newspaper at breakfast. That's a first.
now, Emily. - Well, it is.
jeez, what happened to you?
a happy how-do-you-do to you, too. - Sorry. You look bad.
I didn't get much sleep last night. - Why not?
Rory and I had a fight, and she ran away. - What? Where? Did you...
she's fine. She's at my mother's.
God! Throw that in with the first part. You'll scare a person to death.
sorry. You know, I got in my car three times to go get her.
I drove halfway there and drove back.
I actually ran out of gas driving halfway there and back.
she'll cool off and come home. - I know.
this breaking up with Dean has been so hard on her.
I just hate that she's going through this. She's such a good kid.
she's so nice to everyone, she cares about everyone...
and she's walking around in this unbelievable pain.
there's nothing I can do about it.
she won't talk to me, or tell me what happened.
I'll tell you what happened. Dean's a jerk...
and he let her know it. - I wish I could pinch his head off.
I'll help. - I warned him when I first met him...
if he hurt her... Maybe I could key his car.
or better, you can key Taylor's car and say Dean did it.
that' d be good. - Then key Taylor's car, tell him Dean did it.
also tell him that Dean littered and walks his dog without a leash.
he'll run him out of town. - Good.
all right, I should go. Rory's probably out of school by now...
and I want to be home in case she decides to call.
coffee's on the house. - Thanks.
is that the belt I bought you? - Yeah, the old one broke.
lucky you happened to have a spare.
she'll be home soon.
got a minute? - Actually...
I just want to tell you that I think you are scum.
gee, thanks.
you'll be hard-pressed to find another girl as fantastic as Rory. You know that?
she is beautiful and smart and did not deserve to be treated that way by you.
treated what way? - I thought you were a good guy.
I thought you were going to make her happy.
I'm an idiot to have thought you were a good pick.
but I was wrong, and I hate to be wrong.
I am sick and tired of everyone blaming this thing on me.
I mean, you and this stupid town looking at me like I'm a criminal.
I say, 'I love you,' and she just sits there, and I'm the jerk? I'm the bad guy?
what? - You know what? Think what you want.
I don't care. Just leave me alone.
where is she? - I thought you were gonna call.
where is she, Mom?
I haven't had any time to prepare her for this.
mom, where is she? - Upstairs in her room.
she got home from school, but just went right upstairs.
she didn't want a snack, but I had Rosa make one.
I haven't checked if she's eaten it.
she had a decent breakfast this morning, but seemed tired.
when I went to her bathroom, the aspirin bottle was out.
I assume she had a headache. I don't know if it was last...
excuse me, Mr. Cosell, I appreciate the play-by-play...
but I want to talk to my daughter now.
do you want me to go in there with you? - More than anything.
try and be nice. - Thanks for the tip.
Hey. - Mom.
okay, so, I thought when you said, 'I'll see you at home'...
you meant our home. My mistake. - I'm so sorry.
it's okay.
all of those things... - I know.
and then... - It's no big deal.
I'm just so... - I know, I know.
the last time I saw you, you were headed home. Wanna fill in the blanks?
I don't know. I just snapped...
and I got sick of everything. I wanted to go anywhere.
so you picked hell?
it was the first place that came to mind. - I respect that.
the need to run is a feeling I am well acquainted with.
but we have to be able to talk, always.
no matter how mad or upset we get with each other...
our particular special thing only works if we agree to that, get it?
I get it. - Good.
Rory, tell me what happened with you and Dean.
I don't want to talk about it. - I do.
Why? - Because I had a little chat with him today.
what? Why?
because I was upset and in the mood to do a little yelling.
you didn't. - I did.
no. - There he was, stacking cookies...
and I'm railing on him about what a great kid you are...
and how it sucked that he dumped you, and then he said he told you he loved you.
and I started feeling a little stupid. - He did tell me.
and you didn't say anything? - No.
it must've been rough on him. - He looked so hurt.
I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt him.
I just got scared and I sat there. - I understand.
you know, I'm still learning this stuff, too. Since I'm still learning...
I think I haven't thought enough about what I'm supposed to be teaching you.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about my own personal lack of commitment skills.
I mean, look, I love that you have my eyes and my coffee addiction...
and my taste in music and movies.
but when it comes to love and relationships...
I don't necessarily want you to be like me.
I'd hate to think that I raised a kid who couldn't say 'I love you. '
mom. - I'm not talking specifically about Dean.
I mean, just generally in life. For example, say you're dating Taylor Hanson.
why am I dating Taylor Hanson? - It's a hypothetical scenario. Go with it.
so you and Taylor are seeing each other regularly.
how did I meet Taylor Hanson? - You went to his concert.
you got backstage. Your eyes met across the crowd and you're seeing each other.
Hanson's still together? - They're the new Bee Gees.
why would you not stop me from going to a Hanson concert?
someone's trying to make a point here. - Sorry. Go ahead.
so you and Taylor have been dating for a while and things are great...
and you're happy.
you feel all those crazy mushy things that people feel when they're in love.
I want you to be able to say to him: 'Taylor, I love you. '
can we pick a new hypothetical, 'cause this one's wigging me out?
my point is that it's scary to be in love. That much I know.
but it's also wonderful and special. And if you can't say it or fully express it...
then you're never gonna be able to experience it.
I want you to experience everything that's great because you're so great.
are you hearing me? - Yeah, I'm hearing you.
I'm not saying you say 'I love you' at the drop of a hat.
it has to be right and real...
and it has to take a lot of thought.
but someday, with someone, it will be right.
I want you to be ready for that moment when it happens.
are you ready for that moment when it happens?
I'm working on it.
I do, however, know what dress I'll be wearing.
thank you guys so much. - It was our pleasure.
what do I owe you for the cab? - Don't worry about that.
thanks for sharing your paper. - Any time.
and thank you, Mom. - Of course. She's our granddaughter.
all right. We'll see you tomorrow night. - 7: 00.
really, is it 7: 00, 'cause I wasn't... - Goodbye, Lorelai.
looks like it's just the two of us again.
I guess so.
I was almost tempted to see if she could make a Pop-Tart.
wow, home-cooked breakfast, homemade lunch.
I'm trying to remember why I left there. Yeah, my parents.
funny, funny girl.
let me out here. - Okay.
I'll meet you back at the house. - Excuse me?
I'll show up this time. - I'll have the pizza waiting.
Hello?
now, I'm starting with the'A's,' so first up is Richie Andrews.
he's either a second cousin on my mother's side...
or the guy who re-grouted the bathroom.
either way, I think he's gonna be thrilled to hear about us.
after I've called everyone in here...
I'm gonna spread the word at the Inn.
I thought I'd put little notices in everyone's rooms...
welcome to the Independence Inn. Max and Lorelai are back together. '
can I see you after your dinner tomorrow night?
who's that? - The new judge. He arrived yesterday.
good day to you. - We kiss your hands...
he's a judge? - Yes... a judge.
is he dangerous? - No, no... he's a gentleman.
why did you speak so quietly then?
moron, because I got a cold! I lost my voice!
GIOVANNONA LONG-THIGH, HONORABLY DISHONORED
you're a local, what weather can we expect?
what would I know?
hold this...
what barbarians!
this needs analysing immediately... - Drugs?
no, dirty river water. Send it to the Catania hygiene office.
will do.
come in.
good day, judge
the Catania report has come, the water analysis.
good, have you read it? - Yes, it says the water's polluted.
what a surprise, we didn't need Catania rocket science to learn that!
I want to know the cause.
the report talks of dangerous colored substances.
the pollution is caused by industrial effluent.
it probably comes from a paint factory.
great, we'll strike immediately...
you're local, do you know of a factory near the river?
as far as I know there's only one...the cheese factory.
the Straccolone?!
scandal IN SICILY
judge FINDS POLLUTED STREAM

Straccolone FACTORY ORDERED SHUT

the STRACCOLONE SCANDAL
italian SKYSCRAPER
commander La Noce is in his office and unavailable.
I repeat, he's busy. Try calling tomorrow.
careful, that typewriter can give you a shock.
Albertini!
Albertini!
where are you?!
tell me, s-s-sir... - Albertini, try to relax.
if you get upset you stutter, and if you stutter I get upset, ok?
Yes, sir... - Give me a cigarette.
they're finished... - Ok, forget it.
have you found that "honorable" whatever?
I spent two days on the phone, got cramps in my fingers...
all the "honorables" in Italy have vanished.
I knew it! The moment people need their representatives...
we have to find honorable Mr. Zuzzu, he always helps us!
I did. - Did he hit you?
Yes, with a pot. - Were you in a kitchen?
no, a clinic... it was ceramic, what they call a chamber pot.
is he sick? - Hepatitis.
he says it was our free samples.
damn, you know you shouldn't eat our cheese!
what could I do? Our brochure is our only edible product!
it's too late now...
sure! You're relaxed because you don't give a damn!
but if we go bust, your butt's on the street too!
try laughing when you're in shit up to here.
I'm sorry, the b-b-b... - You're an idiot!
What?! - Commander...
were you eavesdropping?
do you want to know how we are? Awful, my beauty!
but you'll be fine, with those tits, you've no need to worry!
but I'm off! I'll go abroad, emigrate!
I'll go to Mexico, Peru, Lake 'Titicaca!
titi who? - Who knows?
to think I could be on television now.
as an employee? - No, a p-p-presenter.
I sat the exam! - How did it go?
G-g-great! - Why didn't they take you?
they say I'm an a-a-anarchist!
what on earth are you doing?!
go rest in peace!
can't you sleep? - No!
I won't be the only one staying awake tonight.
I realized that!
Hello! - Hello, who's there?
Albertini? - You sound far away...
Albertini!
Hello? - I knew it! You were sleeping, right?
no, not at all! Who sleeps at 2 AM?
I don't care, I'm awake! How are we doing with Pedicò!
with who? - With Pedicò!
who's he? - Idiot!
two years ago he was industry under-secretary.
he's an important politician, might become a minister...
and we don't know him! We have to woo certain people--.
as you woo beautiful women!
you're right, but with P-Pedicò we have an advantage...
we're still virgins.
you won't be for long, one of these days I'll bust your ass!
No! "Virgins" in the sense that Pedicò still hasn't received...
our free samples! - Right, that's true...
but how can we reach him? - Through someone in his party.
wait, wait!
Marta, will you let me have it?
holy Mother, don't tempt me! I'm doing 40 hours...
who cares, do six days if you want...
do Milan-Sanremo, or whatever comes to mind!
Hello, Albertini? I've had an idea... Albertini?
moron! - Hello, who am I talking to?
damn you! Are you asleep?
no, I'm an insomniac! - Good. I've had an idea.
do you remember Monsignor Alatri, he organized "Kids City"?
I was about to mention him! - I did instead!
we have to find him immediately.
I want to see him tomorrow. Call him at Rocca Pizzo...
and book two flights for Catania.
call now, at 2 AM? - Sure... you're the insomniac.
yes... but not the monsignor!
don't call long distance, I pay the phone bill.
how was your flight? - Wonderful, monsignor...
a marvellous one hour. It's longer from Catania to here!
what a lovely day... - Would you like a 'cannolo'?
no, don't tempt me... your offer is generous, however.
I hope your wife doesn't mind...
why should my wife mind if I eat an extra 'cannolo'?
I was referring to the land you made available for "Kids City."
right, I'd forgotten...
it's also your wife's, right? - Yes, of course...
but as you know, Marta is a very devout woman.
this comforts me greatly. Clotilde, could you get the file, please...
immediately, monsignor...
I don't think she'll oppose this small formality...
what is it? - A binding commitment...
your secretary mentioned the reason for your visit...
so I prepared a small statement.
I see you don't waste time...
my motto is, "The paths to paradise are infinite, and should be walked well."
that's a good one!
would you care to sign? - Yes, yes, no, no, but...
I don't have a pen! - Here, a Japanese double-tip!
writes 24 hours non-stop. - Great... you son of a bitch!
24 hours non-stop, Japanese double-tip... here, monsignor.
I'd like to take advantage of this meeting to ask your advice...
he already knows, commander...
did you tell him? - No, everyone knows your problem...
it's all lies! Chemical products are only used to purify...
if you can find one gram of that stuff in our Straccolone...
I'll become a priest! I mean... it's slanderous!
sure, but in cases like this you need top-level backing...
we thought of Honorable Pedicò... - An excellent choice.
he's a devout Christian, a man of rare virtue.
he lives in a country villa with his wife Maria Annunziata, known as Mary.
a woman of great... - Virtue?
no, stature.
they're often accompanied by his secretary, Eufemia...
and attend midday mass every Sunday.
Carmelo Pedicò is the right man, his power is unlimited.
his word is law, his wishes command...
in the Rocca Pizzo province, come fair weather or foul.
so, if it rains tomorrow we'll know who to blame!
we'll have no problem finding him on Sunday.
there are other problems... - Why, is he stubborn, a crook?
no, he's honest... - Then it's done!
honorable Pedicò! May I have a word?
Ah, monsignor! Wait in the car, Maw...
come with me...
honorable, I wanted to introduce two dear friends...
commander La Noce and accountant Albertini, his secretary.
my secretary, Eufemia.
commander La Noce is president of Straccolone, the cheese factory...
currently, as you know, the victim of a regrettable circumstance.
sadly Italy has 116, 000 regrettable circumstances every day!
I beg you, sir, you can do a lot... - I'm merely a deputy...
Yes, but everyone says you are a fat...
I mean, a faithful interpreter of people's needs, soon to be a minister.
I thank you for the thought. The elections will be soon...
and all will be clear! I'm sorry, my wife is waiting in the car.
let me accompany you. - Thank you...
another stitch up! - Really?
didn't you hear? He wants to establish the truth.
commander, we need to make a drastic decision.
don't say stupid things... - I didn't say anything stupid.
I knew it would end like that!
that priest made a fool of me!
he took the land, and we haven't heard from Pedicò since!
it's been three days already! - Pedicò must have some flaw...
if we find his weak point, we're there!
you spoke without stuttering, but nonsense as usual!
I know everything about Pedicò's past and present...
he doesn't steal, doesn't speculate, has no illegitimate children...
...doesn't blackmail, smuggle, or take drugs...
and despite being Sicilian, he's not even mafia!
what an awful man!
who is it? - A priest from Monsignor Alatri.
send him in!
our man from heaven has come. Open, quickly...
please...
good day. Commander La Noce?
Yes, that's me, take a seat...
so, Monsignor Alatri, any news?
actually, I'm not sure I can speak...
speak freely, these are my collaborators... unfortunately.
I have an explosive document on your honorable gentleman...
Pedicò?! - I can't name him...
I knew that honorable man, who we can't name...
had an A-A-Achilles' heel!
this is engineer De Vitis, our honorable helped him obtain...
the famous Riva dei Ciclopi construction project.
this is engineer de Vitis' wife...
Oh, my gooooosh!
I have to change... - No! Oh, please.
this is professor Tamigiani, our honorable helped make him head...
of a Palermo clinic, even though, as a doctor, Tamigiani...
is P-P-pitiful!
this is professor Tamigiani's wife...
holy fuck! - Behind me, Satan!
move ahead, reverend!
this is professor Voccia...
our honorable helped him obtain an exclusive patent...
worth 200 million.
this is Mrs. Voccia, may God keep her safe!
what a guy, this Honorable Pedicò!
he has a weakness for other men's wives.
commander, we're riding a winner! - Albertini, dismount and think-.
what can I do, send my wife to sleep with our honorable?
knowing your wife, you'd do better to send the monsignor!
Albertini, you must be exhausted...
take two days' vacation!
commander, I've an idea. - This time I'll shoot you!
listen... your wife's all "church and home," no one knows her...
what's to stop us replacing her with another woman?
for example, with a beautiful girl like our Luisella...
engineer, you've gone crazy!
my boyfriend plays basketball and he's six foot four!
ask him, if you dare! Commander, may I go?
good night! What's got into you?
it was just a hypothesis... do you know how many I can find, better than her?
I have a simple, infallible plan!
friday night Pedicò takes the sleeper train for Rocca Pizzo...
we find a beautiful girl who gets on the same train with you...
who you introduce as your wife! Have I been clear?
you didn't stutter this time either, though it's not a bad idea!
can you find the right girl? - If I don't, I'll cut my...
I'll hold you to it! - Not those... I'll cut my hair!
with modern technology, all it takes is a button!
Hello, can I help? - Well, I'd like...
car, home or boat?
be clear.
explain. - A loose woman...
be clear. - A slut, ok?!
fine, last on the left.
good day. - How can I help you?
the woman on information sent me...
I'm looking for a special friend. - Tell me your preferences...
tall, short, thin, rotund, blonde, red, brunette?
actually, it's not for me, it's for a friend...
don't you know your friend's tastes?
she must be Swed... - Swedish?
no, a sweetie. One who makes you book heart treatment on sight.
I see, leave it to me...
blonde, busty, 5 foot 8...
Ah, sorry, she has to be a good t-t-talker...
we'll put "good, quick tongue."
perfect!
we're searching Turin to Venice. That's the best area.
the electronic brain will reply in 10 seconds...
see how quick it is?
miss G. R. number 116, will fly Alitalia from Milan at 15: 10 hours...
arriving Rome 16: 10.
are you sure you'll recognize her? - No, we've never met...
so what do we do, stop every blonde on sight?
we're in the hands of the electronic brain, its organization is perfect.
the girl will go to the news-stand and buy a copy of "Corriere di Brescia."
O-o-o...
O-o... - Of course, over there...
no, I mean, oh fuck!
that must be her... - Relax, we'll know in a moment.
the "Giornale di Bergamo," please. - Isn't "Corriere di Brescia" better?
Why? - Bergamo and Brescia are neighbors, no?
no.
when you make love, do you talk to your husband?
only if he phones...
the "Giornale di Brescia," please...
Thanks.
are you from Brescia? - Yes, I'm Mr. G. R. 116.
incredible! - What?! I'll take our honorable this?
Honorables are fine by me, I'm not fussy.
impossible, the electronic brain never makes mistakes.
you're right, the mistake is all mine.
I've been a mistake since my father conceived me.
laugh away. Your father hardly got you right!
right, an electronic brain with balls of ricotta cheese!
if I'd asked for a liquidizer, they'd have sent an aircraft carrier!
it's not like I wanted a harpist, or a Chinese translator...
damn, all I wanted was a slut!
# I'm a woman, I'm no saint...
# Don't tempt me, I'm no saint...
Hi!
these girls have picked a bad road...no one passes here!
hey boy, are you afraid of us?
no...
I can't take him one who does this for a "living..."
far from "living," she'd have us "dead."
if I present her as Mrs. La Noce, all "church and home..."
honorable Pedicò will turn Muslim!
darling, fancy a tickle?
go on, there's no tax!
are you expecting anyone? - Yes, clients.
you look new... - I am.
great, just what I was looking for...Hop in!
5, 000 lira. - Is that all?! Come on, hop in!
what are you ca-ca-called? - Coco.
are you shittin' me? - No, my name's Coco.
Coco... the name's not important...
listen, would you like to earn a b-b-bunch of money?
Robertuzzo said 5, 000. - Who? Ah, your guy...
if I offer 400, 000 for two days' work...
would Robertuzzo be co-co... - I'm Coco!
Co-content, I meant! - Uh...
you don't talk much? Good, I like that!
a woman who ta-ta...I'll tell you later!
so, will you do two days for me?
well, ok... - A deal?
what about Robertuzzo? - Don't worry, I'll handle him.
we'll write him a note and leave it at his house...
that'll keep it between us two...
come in, come...
to the left.
I'll show you...
I used to share with mother...
then she went home. Make yourself at home...
God your house is a mess! We'll fix it up later...
are you a speed queen, or something? This is Rome, not the Monza Grand Prix!
not talking's fine, but do you need to strip without warning?
you're Commander La Noce's wife now, you have to dress like a dove...
you only strip when Pedicò starts to chat you up...
Coco, are you getting this?
we have to hurry, the train leaves at 7: 00...
wait, I'll go buy you some lady's clothes.
let's get your measurements...
98...
98... to think that from these breasts...
depends the life of one hundred men!
a hundred? - You don't need to feed them directly!
once you get under Pedicò, they'll all go back to work...
110
Oh my God...I'm tempted to screw it all!
Hello? - You moron, where the fuck are you?
wait, before getting angry you should see...
what the hell have you done?!
we're cha-cha... - Have you got a girl, or not?
yes... she's beautiful. - Albertini!
beautiful, real, ca-caressable!
you're such a sweetie! - Me?
Yeah, sweet and righteous!
with a john like you, I'd be the happiest whore in the world!
you can't talk like that! - Why not? Robertuzzo never minded!
what the fuck's wrong with you?
shit, I never noticed your language! - You know, I'm very shy...
but with you, I feel free to say what I like!
shut up already!
you sure know how to make a woman like me feel good...
the total opposite of Robertuzzo! - Coco, shut up!
when he gets something up his ass, he beats the shit out of me...
Coco, we're in trouble! You can't be the commander's wife!
you know what? I don't fucking care...
it's you I like... - Oh my God!
I should make her eat a dictionary!
Albertini!
where are you going?!
at last! Splendid, truly splendid! Enchanting!
commander, she's a d-d...
I can tell, delightful! - Commander, are you on this train too?
Yes, a sudden business trip, something important...
let me introduce my wife. - An honor, madam...
my compliments to your beauty!
and my secretary, actually, my right arm...
an incomparable, irreplaceable man...
but for him I would have missed the train and the deal...
commander, I-I-I... - You what?!
we need to talk! - What's up now?
I'll tell you!
don't shove, are you crazy?! - I need to be alone with you!
I don't want to be alone with you!
I'll make you want to...it's important, really!
ma'am, go back to your grave, please!
No! No! I've been cursed since I met you!
hi there, auntie!
let's hope war breaks out and you're my nurse!
God you're beautiful! - Wanna meet my little brother?
bring your hat here, sweetie, you're on the wrong train!
stop that!
get inside, move! - Get your hands off me!
you'll pay for this! - Yeah, sure...
idiot, at the last moment you tell me it won't work... why?!
even! second word she says "fuck" four times!
no I don't! The "fucks" are yours! All I said was I like you...
but I'll still do the work...
with the commander, the honorable, the station master, who the fuck ever!
does she always speak like that? - No, worse!
didn't you realize earlier?
I was looking for a stunner, not a Nobel winner!
throw her off the train! - What?!
it's too late, now...
you're fired immediately! - On the train?
Yes. - Fired on a speeding train?
Yes! - I see...
I'm a failure, I've no more reason to live!
give me a rope!
to hang yourself?
no, to stop that bag falling on my head!
fuck you and the bag!
Ah, honorable, are you on this train too?
like even! Friday...
lemon juice with a dash of bicarbonate and sugar, please...
and a Fernet for the lady.
honorable, this is your day for meetings!
first lawyer Rossi, then Colonel Maccicché, and now La Noce!
do you know La Noce, sir? - La Noce... do we know La Noce?
Yes, sir, the Roman industrialist with a cheese factory in Rocca Pizzo.
Monsignor Alatri mentioned him, so we met him...
did we speak?
Yes, one Sunday after mass, a very interesting person.
now I recall. An industrialist with a rather regrettable situation...
but you should see his wife!
beautiful? - Amazing!
haven't you met? - I haven't had the honor...
she's a marvel! - Her husband must be very jealous!
in fact, he keeps her hidden!
he must come to diner, he must bring her to the dining car.
I'll get you sandwiches, but don't move from here.
good luck... - You too, honorable...
goodbye... - Your Fernet Branca.
Hi. - Hi...
commander La Noce... - Commander La Noce!
my dear sir! - We were just talking of you...
I hope it was something good!
don't be modest, how could one talk otherwise of you?
you're an exquisite woman - Why haven't we heard from you?
I didn't want to bother your... - You're no bother.
in fact, to show my friendship, I invite you and your wife to dinner.
MY---my wife? Really?
we know she's traveling on this train...
and you keep her "hidden."
I hope you won't insult me by refusing!
not at all, happily...
we did well to take the second sitting...
that way we've no hurry! - Yes, no hurry...
it's so nice here, and this fruit salad is delicious...
Yes, truly excellent...
I see the lady doesn't like her fruit salad.
not at all, she loves it, she's crazy about it!
sir, do you go to Sicily often? - Yes, whenever possible!
does madam know Sicily?
no, she doesn't, but you're so right to take a little rest...
I do whenever I can!
this week I've a lot to do, I have to reorganize my library...
eufemia, by the way...I suggest you retire to bed...
you have a busy day tomorrow. - Actually, I...
go, go! Our guests will excuse you...
Goodnight, everyone! - Sweet dreams, madam.
sent from heaven...
Thanks, you too...
bye...
I'm so sorry...
it was my fault, I got in the way...
sit, sit!
no, don't worry...
no, madam, I can't allow this, you're kind...
I'm deeply mortified...
I can't allow...
well, whatever...
I'm Honorable Pedicò's secretary.
a pleasure... - Not for me.
the honorable has been given cabin 7, and me number 3. It's too far away.
who's in number 6? - Let's see...
it's Mr. Straccolone, who's also taken number 5...
it's not a man, it's a company, and they've booked 3 people.
so, is there a cabin free near me?
Yes, number 1, over the wheels, which no one wants.
good, put the honorable in there. - Over the wheels?
Yes! Given we can't put him under them!
guard? - Yes, madam?
we had seen zeese people behaving very scandal.
we want to change cabin. - Fuck me, what a night!
I mean, I can't kick them out! - Gut, zis is very gut!
I'll put you in cabin 7, it's a very quiet cabin.
Zis is peace and quiet? - Totally quiet, eternally peaceful!
Cheers... am Wrong, or does madam never 'speak'?
true, she never speaks but...
the lady fu-fu... - "Fu" what?
she's founded two important charitable ventures...
and to make sure they succeed, she's made a vow to Saint Rocco.
Ah, right, I forgot...a 24-hour vow of silence!
that's very noble...I'm only sorry not to hear her voice.
the vow ends tomorrow at noon...
however, isn't it time we went to bed?
Yes, my wife is very tired. - Would you like a coffee?
please, if she takes coffee, she won't sleep till Christmas!
madam, I'm truly enchanted...
thank you, I'm moved by your kindness...
she can't speak, so I translate her thoughts!
goodnight... - Thank you so much. Come, dear...
holy Mother of God, what a woman! - Yes, extraordinary...
you know her well, tell me about her.
what kind of woman is she? - Mrs. La Noce is a saint...
a saint? - With all the sacrifices of a saint...
but at the same time a devil!
in what way? - One way, straight to hell!
she's ca-ca... - Candid?
no, ca-ca... - A cat?
Carnal! - A slave to her senses?
in other words, is she "beddable"?
bed, folding bed, blanket...she's a nympho!
a nymphomaniac? So what's with Saint Rocco?
she gets sexual attacks, for hours, weeks, months...
she turns you to rubber, then returns to her senses...
has an attack of religious remorse, and becomes a saint!
it's an amazingly sensual scenario!
holy Mother of God!
you're an excellent organizer...let's arrange something in secret.
waiter, champagne! - A great idea...
we're there... - Where, Sicily?
no, with the honorable Pedicò...I've fixed everything.
he's next door... first we get him randy as a rooster...
then I go and announce I've convinced your wife.
a "church and home" woman? How?
my mind's a miracle!
guard? - Uh?
guard, where's my cabin? - I don't know, sir...
you don't know? - Ah, you're the honorable sir!
not very, right now... - One too many never dishonored no one.
but three bottles did! - You're in number 1, sir.
please, this way. - Here?
you'll have a great night here. - I hope so!
louder, he can't hear you!
Yes, I like it! Give it to me...
kiss me, kiss my mouth! Kiss my prick!
Yes, yes, like that! ...
yes... who cares about the honorable...
great, that's great!
you're fabulous!
stop that... we're here to work! Stop, you filthy pig!
commander, I got carried away by passion!
you brute!
guard!
what is it, ladies?
to sleep impossible when ze man he say "my prick"!
Zer is another who say "filthy pig"!
my apologies, these things happen in the best sleeping cars!
I'll put you in cabin 9.
after this, I'm down to the engine itself.
no worries, the man in 8 is deaf!
Battipaglia station!
is anyone there? Guard!
good evening... - Hi, I'm looking for a bed...
don't disappoint me. - No, no, of course not...
here, sweetie.
come, it's a quiet night, we've still some beds.
thank you, what luck to find such a kind young man!
here, number 7 is free...
shouldn't I do something first?
I don't know, sir, the toilets are at either end of the carriage...
no, silly, I meant a ticket...
you do that with the ticket collector. - The ticket collector...
night... - Uh, good night...
even on the trains!
can I help, sir? - No, thanks, I'm going to the toilet...
OK, I leave first, warn Pedicò, and then go to my cabin...
you wait 10 minutes, then go to cabin 7, Pedicò's...
Hey, remember not to open your mouth...
shall we synchronize watches? - Fuck off!
it was for the sake of organization...
honorable, still awake?
that champagne went to my head...
do you feel sick? - I'm fine now... and the lady?
I convinced her, she'll be in your arms shortly.
I can't wait. Where? - In cabin number 7...
I'll go freshen up to be ready for her...
who is it?
what are you doing? You should be in cabin 7!
but I like number 5... - Don't be silly, go to Pedicò!
who cares about Pedicò? I like you. If I had a man like you...
I know, but leave! Go to the honorable!
not so fast, sweetie! When I make love...
I go all the way! Otherwise I get hiccups!
God, what melons! And what amazing thighs!
I shouldn't boast, but back home they call me "Giovannona Long-thigh."
Robertuzzo made me change the name... he says Coco is more refined.
darling... - What are you doing... that's my nose!
Damn! They even put handles!
number 3?
what cheek, imagine if the honorable knew!
what? - I knew you'd come!
that's why I left the door open!
no, no, madam! For the love of God, stop!
madam, I'm moved deeply to be on my knees beside you...
to express my immense admiration.
I know you can't talk, but that doesn't matter...
I now entrust to my hands...
the task of warming you, stimulating you...
until our embrace becomes a raging flood...
as unstoppable and incandescent as an eruption on Etna!
over these shoulders, this hip...
this promontory...
my hands...
mamma!
help! Help!
he's a crab! He's grabbed me like a crab!
get off, let me go!
I feel sick, oh God, I feel sick!
help, guard, help!
help!
listen, give me a hand... - What happened?
he's not a crab, he's a fag! - A fag?!
Rocca Pizzo station!
the Rome train for Catania-Siracusa...
is arriving on platform 3.
that's it! No discussion! You take the first plane to Rome!
sorry, but if I'm fired, I can stay where I want at my expense.
a smartass, huh? Then I re-hire you, and order you back to Rome!
can I take her with me? - Yes, yes...
I wish! But Pedicò now knows her as my wife, so she has to stay.
commander, let me f-f-f... - Fuck you, period!
let me fix things... I got her into this mess, but I'll get her out...
commander, where are you going? That's the shithouse!
enough foul language! Vanish!
farewell, Coco... - What? We'll meet again!
can I give him a kiss? - Are you crazy?
commander! - Pedicò's coming, vanish!
the first flight, ok? Come...
bye... - Farewell, Coco!
honorable... - I'm going by Rocca Pizzo...
if you'd like a ride...
isn't your secretary coming?
no, he has to go to Rome on urgent business.
it was a lapse...
coming out of the toilet, distracted by certain thoughts...
I went further down the corridor and opened the wrong door.
a terrifying scene!
why not join us for breakfast?
it would be a pleasure. Wouldn't it, Eufemia?
Mary would be happy too...
Thanks, but I have business to attend...
but we always eat late, at 2: 00.
did the silencer fall off your shoes? - What do you care?!
do you know where Albertini lives? - There...
on the second floor.
there he is now!
thanks... I'll give you a tip...
keep the change...
damn that traffic warden!
who is he?!
officer Thisson... Thisson...Thisson... !
This-son-of-a-bitch must have woken up on the wrong foot!
welcome back! I've been waiting two days for you...
for me?
Coco will be back in two days. Don't worry, Mario Albertini.
it's even got Coco's mark...
you're Mr. Robertuzzo. I wrote so you wouldn't worry.
Coco gave me your ad-ad-ad... address...
Where's Coco? - You mean, "Kid Coconut..."
let's go, people get mugged here... - That's nothing, where's Coco?
the Ia-Ia... - Don't sing, I get nervous!
the lady is working on something useful for her career...
right now she's in Sicily. - Ah, Sicily...
people get mugged here all the time...
damn you, what's she doing in Sicily?
I can't say, otherwise our talk will degenerate...
until now it's been so relaxed!
Coco is with my boss, Commander La Noce, pretending to be his wife...
why all the play acting? - So honorable Pedicò can screw her...
there's an honorable involved? So it's a big deal!
I guess so...
you miserable little shit!
you in! Doing business without my permission... I'll kill you!
what lovely fingers you have! Don't waste them on a murder!
OK, enough for today...
if I understood right, you said...
commander La Noce and honorable Pedicò...
Yes, but... now what?
I don't know...an idea will come.
you see my head? It's a factory of ideas!
and you see this? It's an assembly line!
geniuses should give each other a hand!
you're right! - Stop, you don't know who I am!
an asshole. - How did you guess?!
Where's he going?
I took the liberty because I was sure you'd understand, Mrs. La Noce.
I thank you for the information, Mr. Robertuzzo...
but I've stopped being interested in my husband for some time.
maybe I wasn't clear, Mrs. La Noce...
my girl does it for a "living."
she goes with men... I mean...
she's a slut!
still, I feel for her. Dealing with my husband is not pleasant...
madam, let's stick to the facts. Your husband has taken Coco to Sicily...
and introduced her to honorable Pedicò.
an honorable? Why?
he's pretending she's his wife so Pedicò can fuck her!
what? - You understood perfectly...
what a low-life! - You've got it...
Lord, my cup is bitter!
madam, did you add sugar?
he must be stopped, I'll leave immediately!
mine's sweet... - I'll make him pay this time!
I won't take planes. Is there an express to Sicily?
no need... I wouldn't worry if I were you...
my car is a chariot on fire!
OK, you take me. Come back in an hour, I'll be ready to leave!
I'll show everyone the real Mrs. La Noce!
who's that? Mrs. La Noce! - Hi, Robertuzzo...
Hi, what a beautiful woman!
I never imagined you hid such beauty...
you flatter me... - I swear!
strike me dead if I tell a lie... please...
thanks... - Here's my fireball... hop in!
Hi, sorry I'm late. - I just got here myself.
Hey, do you have to park there? Be nice!
actually, she's fucking nice!
you don't say "I fucking love it," you say "I'm enchanted"!
can you get that, or not? Repeat...
I'm enchanted. - Great!
how's it going? - Oh, hi, monsignor.
any progress? - So-so...
she's tries, but she's too "bullheaded."
what do you say?
butthead! - We'll never make it.
I fear you've got the wrong approach, you confuse her with slang...
let's see, so... you don't say "bullhead," nor "butthead."
right, I've heard that...
"Stubborn..."
suppose you're introduced to someone, what do you say?
perfect!
and if they invite you to stay for lunch?
hear that?! She's not bad.
Thanks, I go hoarse for an hour and you play the fresh-faced pedagogue!
Peda-what? - Forget it!
go on, tell the monsignor...
what you say if Pedicò makes that proposal, that one!
Oh, yes...
honorable, go kill yourself dead!
no, Holy Maw! With grace and delicacy!
have you forgotten answer number 6?
you're a very fascinating man...
but I come from an old family and don't have that desire.
you get the idea? I numbered the answers...
now for number 7, to give him hope if he insists...
don't insist, sir, I too am human...
and might forget myself for a moment...
that's a little risky... but I realize it could be useful.
damn, we have to go soon. Let's run over number 1.
good day, please forgive us if we're disturbing your peace...
heavens, it's a real pleasure.
we don't want to be any trouble... - Heavens, Mrs. La Noce...
it's our pleasure. - Commander La Noce.
enchanted, you are a fount of grace and beauty...
thank you... would our guests prefer to be inside or in the garden...
as you wish, we don't give a fuck...
number 3... 3!
it's one o'clock, not 3.
I'm happy either way, whatever you choose is fine...
Carmelo... shall we enjoy the sun in the garden then?
sure, let's keep enjoying the day!
with light like this we can even see Etna!
what a beautiful day...
come and look...
let's go eat, or we'll be late for the Sicily ferry.
OK, Robertuzzo!
where are you going? Come here!
do you like that? Mummy will buy you it...
no, no... I've already bought you that!
no, stop, candy's bad for you...
n's spicy!
he's cute! Can he talk? - If not, I'll take him back!
Hey, he's perfect! He can really piss!
are you stealing my child?!
what a maniac! - He seemed fake.
are you hurt?
not at all! If I don't fall, it's no fun!
hello.
here, your tip...
Thanks.
one day they'll put me on the 100 lira coin!
with a nose like yours, they'll have to add a handle. Get out!
this is my turf, give me the coin and split. Intruders get their ass kicked!
keep the change...
you're very beautiful... - Thank you.
a woman like you could go far, on the road...
I don't think so, I'm lazy...
maybe you misunderstand. Until now you've been a slave.
you should get a life! Make a living of it!
sorry, what do you mean? - Live by it!
if you let me guide you, I'll show you an unimaginable world...
you're much faster than Robertuzzo's car!
he left us standing! You're just waste of fuel!
the water's really hot!
it's the first time I've seen a pool in a condom!
wonderful...
I didn't know you couldn't swim...
I had an old-style education, I don't take to it!
I'll hold you underneath... - Under what?
your back, naturally...Relax, let yourself go.
what a body...blessed be the water...
that embraces you!
very good!
back hand!
now it's my turn! Like that!
back hand!
Marvellous...
excellent...
my ankle... - Did you twist your ankle?
let's hope it's nothing, lean on me... ...
what a sight!
trust me, don't worry. Relax...
how strange, when I was 18 I had the same accident...
my opponent began to massage me, like you're doing...
he was my first love. - What a strange coincidence!
maybe Giambattista Vico was right...
was that his name? - No!
that history course guy...
Ah, right, the things one remembers after years. Well, not so many!
you're very young! - I wouldn't say very young...
don't be immodest, with such beautiful skin...
commander... - Maw, what happened?
nothing, nothing! - Did you fall and hurt yourself?
no, it's nothing, a twisted ankle...
Yes, it's nothing...the commander has a golden touch.
I didn't know you had thaumaturgic skills...
just some practice!
I'm better already, darling...
I'll go and arrange dinner.
naturally our guests are welcome to join us...
Yes, a great idea...
we wouldn't want to trouble you. - It's no trouble!
in fact, they could stay the night. - Maybe they'll be uncomfortable.
there's the guest room, which is always better than a hotel!
Yes, she's right. They'll be just fine...
the guest room, now there's a solution!
go on, you brute! You guzzle gas, then quit on me!
are you hungover, or what?
can't you see your car's smoking?
she's got all the vices, this mechanic's harlot!
white smoke... 'habemus papam'!
Habemus' seized engine!
Marta?
Hey, Marta!
what are you doing? My driving exhausted you!
Yes, a little...
since the ferry leaves tomorrow morning, we'll wait here.
we'll get something to eat, then get some sleep!
Yes, I'm as hungry as a wolf!
a she-wolf!
hungry, huh?
go Robertuzzo, do your worst, this is a great opportunity!
here I am, darling!
this is my bedroom. - Is it?
I always sleep alone...
I sleep alone, my husband has an awful habit of snoring.
aren't you scared? - Yes, even little noise...
and the night is long when spent alone...
you're telling me...
what? But you have a beautiful wife!
she won't talk to me, my wife is frigid... frozen!
Maw? - Yes?
the commander must be tired, we should let him rest...
we were saying... the commander asked...
if tomorrow a trip to Etna would be possible.
Etna? - Yes.
with gusto!
goodnight dear... - Goodnight madam, and thank you...
Goodnight, Maw...
Coco?
what's up now?
what's up? It's night, we're in bed... you're a woman and I'm a man.
Oof...
Coco, if you're getting nowhere with the honorable, at least comfort me!
forget it, I'm tired! - You can't do that!
I don't want to do anything!
but it's ridiculous to sleep. - Have a heart attack!
you've kept me awake for two nights now!
maybe a coffee...
Where's that skunk going?
well... maybe...
of course, I'll bring it to your room in a moment!
thank you, you're very kind. - Oh, it's nothing!
Matilde! - What is it tonight?
what did our guest want? - A coffee.
Ah, he's getting ready. - Shall I make it?
sure... and go get my tranquillizers.
there... a couple of sleeping pills...
that'll put him to sleep, and I
come!
it's sugared. - Thanks.
Coco, wake up!
coffee... - What?
is it time to get up?
no, stay in bed, we're going to do a little exercise...
drink, little one... Nice?
disgusting!
Coco, stop playing around! Don't be a fool!
what's got into you?
how can a woman like you not have blood in her veins?
Coco?
albertini brought me the mummy of Ramses II!
Commander'?
commander... were you taking advantage of an honorable's wife?
sleep, cuckold!
what a fabulous woman!
madam? Madam!
it's Pedicò! Your husband's asleep...
shall we proceed?
you made a vow, huh? I don't like vows...
you made a vow, huh? I don't like vows...
what a woman! How can you sleep next to this fat-assed pachyderm!
is the cuckold upset?
come, I'll take you to my room. Don't worry, I'll handle it...
come with me...
holy Mother!
madam... madam!
what a beautiful woman!
who is it? - Me.
what do you want? - Open, I'm scared!
scared of what?
Oh God, Carmelo! The ghosts!
now it's ghosts!
one moment! - The ghosts!
open Carmelo, there are ghosts!
one moment!
Carmelo, let me in!
what's got into her'?
what is it? - I'm scared, I heard noises.
I saw ghosts in the garden. Let me stay. I'll be quiet!
Carmelo, please! - Damn those ghosts!
I'll wait for you in my room at midnight
now we'll see who's a cuckold, dear Pedicò!
no one stops. Maybe they think I've hurt my thumb?
come, young man... have you been waiting long?
no, I was a child when I got here!
hop in, quick!
thanks... - Buckle up, we're off!
ready, go!
this car's fast, you know? - Right.
where are you going? - Catania.
perfect, I'm going to Sicily too!
listen to that amazing engine? And get the interior!
carpet, air conditioning, a top-end stereo!
put the radio on!
intense traffic has blocked Highway 213...
and thick fog is reported on mountain stretches.
hold tight, we're taking off!
attention all drivers...
police are looking for a Maserati, stolen one hour ago in Naples.
the thief is an escapee from a mental clinic.
he is believed dangerous...
because he's also half blind. We end this news report here.
we return to our light music program.
did you turn the wipers on? They've got two speeds.
fantastic, no?
who's that? - My grandpa!
are you sure this engine's so fabulous?
you're right, young man... at 150mph the spark plugs exploded!
no, it was me... I was shitting my pants!
where are you going? - To the bathroom, for a pee...
you can't. - Why not?
I need to go first, I'm bursting to pee...
I'm bursting too! - But I'm an honorable!
of course, your excellency!
Christ, she's heavy!
after all this effort, should I fuck her twice?
madam, no one will disturb you here, this is my wife's room...
I'll be right back...
madam Mary, I got your message...
it's midnight... madam? I can't see anyone here...
Coco!
what happened? What did that pig do to you?
what happened? You're frozen, what did he do to you?
Oh, mercy! - Madam, it's me, La Noce...
are you crazy? If my husband sees us he'll shoot you!
OK, but not that way, I'm safer leaving by the window...
just go, please! I beg you!
Maw, what are you doing here? - Who is it?!
I was going to my bathroom, you were taking ages!
Really? - Absolutely, Carmelo... come.
go on, the bathroom will be free all night. Get inside.
a man left by the window of your wife's room. You're a cuckold!
I'll make him pay for this!
stop joking, Coco, answer me! There'll be hell to pay if you die!
for a girl like you, it would be criminal!
Coco, answer me! Be good, just one word...
commander... - Thank you, God!
fuck off. - It's Ok, thanks anyway.
take that!
Carmelo! You know I don't like it when you get rough!
I'm full! An empty one is coming behind...
Hey, want a ride?
OK, but you'll have to get in back with the flowers.
what, in the back? - Yes, why?
where the corpse goes?
no one else has claimed it... - But someone might.
who said so? - The newspaper.
"five claimed dead in crash," it said.
go on, slowly... good. - I hurt everywhere.
I can't even touch myself for luck. Would you mind giving me a scratch?
go, Nicola!
Kitty, be ware the big cat! Good day, madam...
good day, honorable. - You're a marvellous woman.
thanks... - I'd do anything for you.
please, I wouldn't want to trouble you...
I'm sorry about last night, but I'm kept under strict control...
my wife is a very jealous woman...
by the way, have you seen her around? - Yes, earlier...
then they went for a hike on the mountain.
they've gone already? She's alone with your husband?
and no one else? - No one...
aren't you jealous of your husband? - I'm a human being too!
we're all human, but aren't you scared something might happen?
well, my husband's "just smoke" these days...
wonderful! His gun's stopped firing!
with me you'll feel you're on the front line!
the lava reached here in '71.
craters can erupt when you least expect it...
it sounds dangerous!
in fact, my husband never comes here, he's scared!
as a child, he very nearly died in an eruption...
are you scared?
with a woman like you, I'm only scared of myself...
commander, what are you saying?
delinquent!
walking on these stones isn't easy...
but don't you love this Dantesque scene?
I have inner fires of my own!
what are you looking at? - I heard a noise...
who knows what it was, I can't see anything!
are you sure you can't see anything? - Madam, you'll catch a cold!
then warm me! - Yes, I'll set you on fire!
not like that, madam!
an eruption!
help!
forgive me, Lord, if I have sinned! Go away!
are you leaving me in this hell?! Wait, madam!
I'm a "respectable" woman!
go away!
stop, wait!
OK, goodbye! - I hope not!
Hi, Coco! Where's the commander?
on the volcano!
wait... blowing this up sure must take a lot of puff!
what happened, did they make you mayor?
no, I got a ride with the undertaker!
how are you, my friend? How lovely to see you!
help, save him!
he's resurfaced! - Help!
I can't swim! - Leave it to me, madam!
hold on!
come on! Here...
come on, up...
not like that, you'll snap his neck!
what a villa! Is anyone home?
he's alive!
the commander... - What do you mean? Explain!
let me go, Marta. - I'm going to kill someone!
are you spying on me?! - What? I can't hear you!
bitch! Is this a vacation, or something?
I take what fucking vacation I feel like! I'm a free woman!
no, you do what I tell you! You owe me respect!
it's me who defends you from being exploited!
quick, my husband will be worried! He'll make a scene!
don't run, take pity on my foot!
if you want to be a slut, you have to take it seriously!
the only slut around here is your sister!
how dare you? - What do you want?!
how dare you raise your voice to a lady!
who the fuck are you? - I'm the fucking master of this house!
go fuck yourself, you fucking chatterbox!
fuck! You don't know who I am!
Oh, my foot!
move your ass!
Marta, how come you're here? And dressed like that?
I came to meet your lover. - How dare you, I demand an apology!
here!
Fetusa! - You bitch!
what are you doing? Stop it!
Albertini, darling, what did they do to you!
enough, you're ladies!
ladies, calm down! This is a respectable house!
shut up, you old whoremonger!
Marta, please, try to understand!
it's a question of business!
I did it to save you from this skunk!
he preys on men's wives, so I brought him a fake wife.
how dare you speak like that!
help! Help!
madam, I'm coming! - It was him!
let him go, I'll deal with him!
this is a kidnapping, I'll see you jailed!
what's that? - A tranquillizer.
I don't want to be tranquillized, I'm a free citizen!
what's broken, doctor?
can't you talk? Are you dumb?
trust me to land the dumb doctor!
I'll make sure you pay for all this!
hear that? You'll pay all damages!
who, me? - Let him be, he's in shock!
I'm the victim of a diabolical plot!
shut up, you prince of shit! - How dare you be informal? !
you, sir, are a prince of shit!
and a cuckold! - That's slander, I've done nothing!
maybe, but he deserves to be a cuckold, and so do you!
what fucking language is this?! Respect the fucking nun, please!
may peace be with you... - And with you too...
you're all reunited... How are you, my son?
fine, compared to my uncle. - How's your uncle?
he's dead!
I don't want no fucking sedatives!
I don't know him... - No one knows me!
tomorrow, you'll find a certain story in the newspaper...
would you like to hear a little preview?
after polluting a river...
with his stinking factory, sought help from an honorable...
who I won't name, but will indicate with a nose!
thank you...
in this dovetailing of social needs and industrial development...
commander La Noce, who you all know...
and Honorable Pedicò, assisting in the political arena...
have succeeded in saving a key source of Italian employment...
...the Straccolone Company, whose products...
are now being sold abroad!
he's a secretary with flair, not like that moron Albertini!
he's so intelligent! - So resourceful...
can't you understand? Night shifts are better than days!
in what sense? - The night shift pays more!
and you only work 5 hours!
plus you can use your daytime hours...
it's delicate... I have to think about it...
there's nothing to discuss, I fear no one...
what you want, you get!
you've decided to work nights, and work nights you will, Ok?!
OK...
bye... - Enjoy.
it's totally dead tonight...
I've only done two cars... - Lucky you!
who's this princess?
what does she want?!
you're off-limits! - Idiot!
look who's talking!
take a hike, or else! - Yeah, move it!
what the fuck do you want from me?!
I'll teach you! You bitches!
what's all this shit?
and who's he?
listen daddy, this is Franceschino's turf!
Franceschino? Who's Franceschino?
who the fuck is Franceschino? Who is he?!
Frankie, show yourself...
Franceschino, don't hurt me! - Fuck off!
No!
Franceschino, you killed him!
come on...
did you get the license number?
come on, darling, come...
the END
this FILM IS A WORK OF FICTION.
we're SORRY IF THERE IS ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL PEOPLE OR INCIDENTS.
Kurt's trying to get used to another school, and Will's trying to get used to the fact that Emma went to Vegas with her boyfriend - and came home married. - I'm happy for you.
Brittany thinks Artie's the best boyfriend ever.
you're magic, Brittany.
which is what Rachel used to think about Finn.
but then she learned this secret about him and Santana - which made her super mad. - Do you think she's prettier than me?
don't answer that. - So she made out with Puck, - which made Finn super mad. - I'm done with you!
because his girlfriends are always making out with Puck.
boyfriend troubles. I got that covered.
considering I'm usually the cause of them, I'd say I'm an expert.
it's like a thing. And that's what you missed on Glee.
are we okay?
you know, we haven't really talked since I told you about me and Carl.
I mean, we haven't talked at all.
are you avoiding me?
not at all.
just a little quiet time alone this year.
will, you can't spend Christmas by yourself. That's horrible.
listen, um, Carl and I are having a big Christmas Eve party.
please at least stop by.
well, thanks, Emma, that's very sweet of you guys, but...
I think it's best if we just keep things separate for a while.
Yeah, okay.
okay, educators, gather around.
it's time to pick your Secret Santa.
everybody's name is in the tub.
you get who you get, and you don't get upset, all right?
last year, I left my stocking up over Christmas vacation, and an entire family of mice started living in it.
their Christmas gift to each other was rabies.
I told my parents that I only want one thing for Christmas this year.
stop friend requesting me on Facebook.
what are you asking Santa for?
I'm sorry? - Artie...
the roads to the North Pole are getting treacherous.
you need to write your letter to Santa really fast and get it in the mail today.
and remember, even the smallest envelope is heavy for an elf.
no way.
we're on the island of misfit toys.
here we don't want to stay.
we want to travel with Santa Claus in his magic sleigh.
a pack full of toys means a sack full of joys for millions of girls and for millions of boys...
when Christmas Day is here.
the most wonderful day of the year.
a jack-in-the-box waits for children to shout...
wake up! Don't you know that it's time to come out?
when Christmas Day is here.
the most wonderful day of the year.
toys galore, scattered on the floor.
there's no room for more.
and it's all because of Santa Claus.
a scooter for Jimmy.
a dolly for Sue.
the kind that will even say "How do you do? "
when Christmas Day is here.
the most wonderful day of the year.
how would you like to be a spotted elephant?
or a choo-choo with square wheels on your caboose?
or a water pistol that shoots...jelly?
we're all misfits!
if we're on the island of unwanted toys, we'll miss all the fun with the girls and the boys when Christmas Day is here.
the most wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful day of the year!
Hey, guys. What's this?
Oh, we're trying to get into the Christmas spirit, Mr. Shue.
Christmas is totally my favorite holiday.
and check out this awesome tree! I found it on the side of the road.
it must have fell off some guy's car.
and the ornaments? - The guy who lives next door finally killed off his elderly mother. And when they carted him off, they left the house, like, wide open, so...
I think she was a holiday hoarder.
uh... And the presents?
I lifted them from a display at the mall. But don't worry. They're empty.
guys, look, I appreciate the effort, but this isn't what Christmas is supposed to be like.
for us, it is.
this tree is like a mascot for Glee Club.
we won Sectionals two years in a row, and according to everyone at this school, we still suck.
...this reindeer sweater last year...
Ooh! - Ho-Ho-Ho, losers.
I'm pretty sure they just added food coloring to real slush from the parking lot.
you can eat that, you know.
no, no. I am not gonna let you guys throw yourselves a pity party.
look, I'm the first one to say that things haven't turned out exactly how I would have liked them to this year, but Christmas is all about being grateful for the things that did.
I thought that was Thanksgiving.
and this year, Glee Club is going to lend a hand to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Children and Youth program - right here in Lima. - How are we going to do that?
by singing about it.
we're going to go classroom to classroom, caroling, to raise money for McKinney-Vento.
wait, classrooms in this school? With like, students in them?
well, if there are no students in them, there will be no one to put money in the collection box while we sing.
we're gonna be killed.
no, guys, it's Christmas...
a time for miracles.
we got to try this.
Finn's right.
so let's start rehearsing.
this year, Glee Club's going full Santa.
haul out the holly.
put up the tree before my spirit falls again!
fill up the stocking.
I may be rushing things, but deck the halls again now...
you suck! - Who goes caroling with a band?
I'd seriously rather be learning.
for we need a little Christmas...
you're making me hate Christmas! Right this very minute...
candles in the wind...
Yeah, that's right, leave!
you suck! I hate you! - Go, go, go!
I can't believe that that teacher let those students speak to us like that.
I can't believe she threw her shoe at us.
I guess we're done caroling.
no, we're not, guys.
we can't let what just happened ruin our Christmas spirit.
Mr. Shue got us this beautiful tree to inspire us.
we're gonna practice now, and gear up for round two tomorrow.
pretty soon, no one will bully us.
Santa Claus can do anything, and this year, I asked for the Glee Club to stop getting picked on.
she's kidding, right?
guys, this is serious. Listen up.
Brittany still believes in Santa Claus.
you cannot be serious. - Last week, Brittany believed a comb had magic powers.
this is kind of a pattern. - She's gonna find out sooner or later.
would you mind, um...
meeting me at the auditorium tomorrow at 4: 00? - Sure.
okay, somebody needs to break the news to her. - Uh-uh. Don't look at me.
I mean, I'm cruel and all, but that's just hardcore.
right! That's my point! Hear me out.
remember when you were a kid, how excited you would get when you would think about Santa Claus?
how awesome it was?
Christmas was the highlight of the year.
why wouldn't you want to keep someone's world magical for a little while longer?
how? - I've got it all figured out.
can I be honest?
I don't understand the difference between an elf and a slave.
I'm not sitting on that guy's lap.
Santas' laps are always really warm, and it's creepy.
we all have to sit on Santa's lap.
which is everyone over the age of six.
I'm pretty sure this isn't going to work.
that guy doesn't even look like Santa.
trust me, all Brittany's gonna see is the suit.
she wants to believe in him.
Mercedes, get up there.
go, Mercedes, go, Mercedes, go.
I've been a very good girl, Santa.
I want a pony, and a doll that laughs and cries and...
one of us smells like McDonalds.
I would like Puckerman to love me. He's a fox.
I would also like sweet potato fries.
I want bling. I can't be any more specific than that.
okay, wait, hold up.
please tell me that is a roll of Certs in your pocket.
do you have anything for stretch marks?
chapstick. Lots of ChapStick.
I want Channing Tatum to stop being in stuff.
when does Asian Santa arrive?
next.
just know, you have rights.
what's your name? - Brittany.
you've gotten really tan.
that's because at the North Pole there's a hole in the ozone.
you're amazing.
I know you're really busy, so I only want one thing for Christmas.
do you see my boyfriend over there?
for Christmas, I want him to be able to walk.
you can do that, can't you, Santa?
sure... I'm on it.
thank you so much, Santa. - Now we're screwed.
now, remember, it has to be lush and romantic.
Why?
because I am very specific when I give a gift.
you don't know how many kittens I've given away because they haven't been just right.
so, do you like my winter wonderland?
well, I don't really like artificial Christmas trees.
I like real ones.
they smell amazing. That's kind of the whole point.
right.
anyway...
merry Christmas.
being a Jew, I generally don't give Christmas gifts, but considering how much you care about the holiday, I figured I'd make an exception.
just... Read it. It's a note.
the bearer of this note is entitled to one song of Rachel Berry's choosing, sung to him or her with love.
at least it's not a kitten.
come sit. - I... I don't think so.
I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work.
look, not letting me apologize isn't fair.
I've let you apologize plenty, and I know that Christmas is supposed to be about forgiveness but...
I'm not ready to forgive you, so please stop trying to make me.
should we, like, leave? - No.
whether it's a heart attack or heartbreak, just like on Broadway, the show must go on.
besides, the AV Club worked so hard on the snow.
greeting cards have all been sent.
the Christmas rush is through.
a special one for you.
merry Christmas, darling.
we're apart, that's true.
but I can dream, and in my dreams, holidays are joyful.
there's always something new.
but every day's a holiday when I'm near to you.
Oh, the lights on my tree, I wish you could see.
I wish it every day.
and the logs on the fire fill me with desire to see you and to say Merry Christmas, darling...
happy New Year, too.
on this Christmas Eve...
I wish I were with you.
I wish I were...
with...you...
merry Christmas, Merry Christmas.
merry Christmas...
merry Christmas...
darling...
darling...
Hey.
you scared me.
good. Because I'm actually Marley's ghost, and
I'm here to tell you to stop studying so hard.
hmm. What's with the boom box?
I need you to sing with me. Well, rehearse with me.
I got a gig singing "Baby, It's Cold Outside,"
in the King's Island Christmas Spectacular.
Ah, a personal favorite.
too bad they'd never let us sing it together.
I mean, as two... artists.
Mmm. So you going to help me out here?
anything to get me to stop reading about Charlemagne.
very good, then.
I really can't stay.
but baby, it's cold outside.
I've got to go away.
but baby, it's cold outside.
this evening has been...
been hoping that you'd drop in.
so very nice.
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice.
my mother will start to worry.
beautiful, what's your hurry?
my father will be pacing the floor.
listen to the fireplace roar.
so really, I'd better scurry.
beautiful, please don't hurry.
but maybe just half a drink more.
put some records on while I pour.
the neighbors might faint.
baby, it's bad out there.
say, what's in this drink?
no cabs to be had out there.
I wish I knew how...
your eyes are like starlight now.
to break this spell.
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell.
I ought to say "No, no, no, sir."
mind if I move in closer?
at least I'm gonna say that I tried.
what's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stay.
baby, don't hold out.
Oh, but it's cold outside.
I've gotta get home.
but baby, you'd freeze out there.
say, lend me a coat.
it's up to your knees out there.
you've really been grand.
I thrill when you touch my hand.
but don't you see?
how can you do this thing to me?
there's bound to be talk tomorrow.
think of my life-long sorrow...
at least there will be plenty implied.
if you got pneumonia and died.
I really can't stay.
get over that hold out.
Ooh, baby, it's cold...
outside!
outside!
I think you're ready.
well, for the record, you are much better than that girl's going to be.
Hey.
Mr. Schuester.
Oh, good to see you, Kurt.
someone special?
no, just a friend.
but on the upside, I am in love with him, and he's actually gay. I call that progress.
how you doing?
classes are harder, but the kids are kinder.
but I miss you guys a lot, though.
so what brings you here?
actually, I need some holiday help.
I don't know if you know this, but I am really bad at Christmas shopping.
Oh, honey, just what I wanted Jumper cables.
this year, I drew Sue in the office pool Secret Santa.
and I tell you, I can't think of anything good.
and you are so great at shopping, - I thought I'd... - I have the perfect idea.
I think I can tell who wrapped that.
who's it for?
Oh, Sue. I drew her as my Secret Santa.
wait a minute. That's not possible.
Sue's my Secret Santa. - No, Sue's my Secret Santa.
I'm everybody's Secret Santa.
Yeah, you can just drop those wherever.
you rigged Secret Santa?
how? It was my idea.
well, you're not the only person at this school who consumes protein powder by the tubful.
remember when I told you I was taking all those science textbooks to an exorcist?
well, that's what we call a diversion.
you filled your tub with your name only.
you're a regular Agatha Christie, except even more sexless.
see, people, I hate Christmas, but I love presents.
Ah, look at this.
it's a track suit with a fur-lined hood for the winter months.
Thanks, fella. - That was Kurt's idea.
these gifts are legally mine.
now, you may or may not be aware of this, but I'm an honorary officer of the Lima Police Department, and if you take my property out of my office,
I will pick up that phone and have you arrested for theft.
we are not going to let you steal Christmas, Sue.
you're not going to get away with this. - I think I already have.
William, Elmo, you, get the hell out of my office.
I just got to say, this is a really expensive blender.
it's top of the line.
at ease, Becky.
I'm gonna stop you right here. Why are you wearing that hat?
because it's Christmas and it's fun.
no, it's offensive. You're wearing a Santa Claus hat, and yet you're handing me no gifts. I need gifts.
you want my hat? - It's a start.
coach, we've got a problem.
Thanks, guys. Those go under the tree in the choir room.
plop it down there. Thank you.
can you believe it? Six different people got Sue a Shake Weight.
Becky, go into the glove box of my Le Car and bring me my tear gas. Then, get me Gloria Allred.
merry Christmas, Sue.
as you can see, we're repoing your gifts.
most can't be returned since you inexplicably opened all of them.
and I licked each one so no one would touch them.
so the staff has agreed to donate them to the homeless kids at McKinney-Vento.
I mean, what is your problem anyway?
were you one of those kids who never got presents at Christmas?
Yes, Dr. Laura. As a matter of fact, I was, and I'm making up for it now.
face it, Sue. We won.
this will not stand.
I have legal rights to those gifts.
you know what, Sue? You don't.
I checked with Human Resources, and because you misrepresented yourself, it is within our legal right to take back these gifts.
ho, ho, ho.
you know what you are, Sue?
you're a grinch.
are you guys punking me?
I thought we were cool after you sang me that song.
this is serious, Coach.
remember when you were a kid, the way you felt when you came downstairs on Christmas morning, seeing that Santa had come?
I do love Santa Claus.
one year, I asked him for a full set of free weights.
kept asking my dad, "How did Santy get those 75-pound dumbbells down the chimney?
should have suspected something when Dad was in traction until the end of January.
you've got the perfect Santa body type.
watch it, Puckerman.
look, we rented the suit.
all you need to do is put it on.
just tell her that you can't give her the gift of me walking this year.
that seems so harsh and not at all like Santa.
she asked Santa for the impossible:
me walking again.
if Christmas morning comes around and I'm not dancing in Glee Club rehearsal with no personal explanation from her idol, she's going to lose faith in Old Saint Nick, and we can't have that.
tell her the elves are working on it.
elves have awesome cord blood for stem cell research, but these advances are a few years away.
okay. - Great.
and then we need you to break into her house.
what? No, no way! - The back door will be open.
I talked to her parents. They really want her to believe, too.
look, Coach.
the janitor staff got you hideous gloves.
give me those.
they'll come in handy.
no fingerprints.
suit up, Becky.
I don't understand why we have to dress up, Coach.
well, this way, if anyone sees us, we'll have plausible deniability.
I repeat, you are a "rein-dog."
trust me, they're real.
how am I looking - Fantastic, Coach.
Yeah, you know, Becky,
copy that.
now, let's go get what is rightfully mine.
Schuester thinks I'm a grinch, well, that's exactly what he's gonna get.
you're a mean one, Sue the Grinch.
you really are a heel.
you're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Sue the Grinch.
you're a bad banana with a greasy black peel.
you're a monster, Sue the Grinch.
your heart's an empty hole.
your brain is full of spiders.
you've got garlic in your soul, Sue the Grinch.
I wouldn't touch you with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole.
you're a foul one, Sue the Grinch.
you're a nasty, wasty skunk.
your heart is full of unwashed socks.
your soul is full of gunk, Sue the Grinch.
Becky, load it up.
Santa?
why, Brittany.
what are you doing here?
I'm bringing a gift to put under the tree for the homeless kids.
it's a dollhouse.
at least their dolls won't be homeless.
what are you doing, Santa?
well, you see, Brittany, uh, one of the lights on the tree isn't working.
so I'm bringing it back home to my workshop.
I'll fix it up there, and I'll bring it back here.
Oh.
shuffle on home.
they took everything.
including all of Sue's Secret Santa gifts we were gonna give to the homeless kids.
only further proof that everyone in this school hates us no matter what we do.
it's not the school.
it's Sue. She did this. - It wasn't Sue, it was Santa.
he said a light was out on the tree, he'd fix everything.
we just need to let him do his thing.
okay.
are you sure Santa was a boy and not a girl, Brittany?
I swear on my life. Santa's a boy. Everybody knows that.
it was probably one of the boys on the football team.
I guess it wasn't Sue.
so our tree is gone.
so our presents are missing.
Santa's probably fixing any dents or chips as we speak.
all around the world today, way worse things have happened to people than this.
sorry, but I'm not going to let this get us down.
tis the season.
I agree. Come on, guys, let's clean this up.
come on.
you and I are the leaders of this club.
all right, we need to fix this.
we have to put everything that's happened behind us and save Christmas for the Glee Club.
I want to make this right.
you smell kind of funny.
Oh, I, um,
I put this on for the car ride over.
I know how much you love the smell of Christmas pine.
but guess I don't really need it now that we have the real thing.
it's so cold out.
it's cuddle weather.
it's unseasonably warm, actually, for this time of year, but, uh...
I just, I really wanted to come here with you.
I mean, the Christmas tree is the foundation of Christmas.
it's the hearth of the Christmas home.
without it, there wouldn't be anywhere to hang the ornaments or put the presents under.
Yeah, yeah. Whenever we put the tree up,
I always knew Christmas was really here.
this one's too small.
but, uh... - Oh, I love this song.
it's, uh, it's my favorite Christmas song. It's Wham!
Yeah, yeah. Cool.
um...
I'm going to look down this row of Frasier firs.
maybe you could check out the Douglases and I'll meet you at the end.
okay.
last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day, you gave it away.
this year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.
once bitten and twice shy, I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.
tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Oh... Well, it's been a year...
it doesn't surprise me.
Christmas...
I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying "I love you," I meant it.
now I know what a fool I've been.
but if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again.
last Christmas, I gave you my heart, And the very next day, you gave it away.
gave it away...
this year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special. Oh, oh, oh...
last Christmas, I gave you my heart...
you gave me away...
you gave me away...
I'll give it to someone special.
last year, for Christmas,
I asked Santa to give me you.
it's not last year anymore.
it's Christmas, Finn. It's time for you to forgive me.
no, I can't.
okay, this is wrong. I shouldn't...
I shouldn't have brought you here.
you messed me up, Rachel.
can't you see how screwed-up I am about this?
I've had two girlfriends, and both of them have cheated on me.
maybe you can ask Santa again for me next year.
I'm officially breaking up with you.
this was my dad's.
he'd want you to do it. For those kids.
this was my uncle's.
it's the first thing I ever stole, actually.
I'm going to look terrible.
shut up. With your bone structure, you could rock the Rosemary's Baby look and still look good.
I'm going to look like Jackie Chan.
if Barbra can pull off a bob, so can I.
enough yapping, let's do this.
Whoa! Whoa! What are you guys doing?
we're going all "Gift of the Magi" to raise money to buy homeless kids those school supplies.
the guys are gonna sell their watches and the girls are gonna sell off their hair.
you can't do that. - Oh, no, it's cool.
most of this isn't mine, anyways.
no, I mean, that's not the answer.
there are other ways to raise money at Christmastime.
no, but we tried caroling, and it didn't work.
wait, I thought you and Finn were getting us a new tree.
we went, but Finn bailed before we could get one.
nice Christmas spirit, Finn. - Wait!
guys, no more fighting.
have any of you ever actually read "Gift of the Magi"?
none of you?
you don't have to read "Gift of the Magi."
everybody knows what it's about.
well, if you actually read it, you'd know what it's about.
life freakin' sucks.
actually, you're right.
the first Christmas you remember having is the greatest day of your life.
your family's all together, there are loads of presents, cookies.
the magic is alive and well.
but before you know it, you grow up.
work and school and girlfriends take over and Christmas becomes more of an obligation, a reminder of what's lost instead of what's possible.
and all of the trees and the presents and even the mistletoe can't change that.
and then when you get to my age...
you're so desperate to get that magic back, you'd do anything to be able to feel how you did that first Christmas.
so what should we do?
put your scissors down, put your watches back on.
we're gonna go out and find some people who really need some Christmas spirit, and we are gonna sing for them.
get a good night's rest, Ken, you're gonna need it.
Barbie took the early flight from Tampa.
Santa?
but it's too early.
well, you know what they say.
early's late if you make tomorrow yesterday.
awesome.
you know, Brittany,
I was in the neighborhood, doing a dry run.
I have so many houses to visit on Christmas Eve,
I got to make sure it goes off without a hitch.
how about you come sit with ol' Santy?
okay!
how about you sit next to Santy instead?
Santy's just a little stinky.
he needs a good ol' sponge bath from Mrs. Claus.
Brittany, do you remember what you asked me for for Christmas?
Yeah, I asked for Artie to be able to walk.
is there anything else that you want? I mean, like, anything?
no.
well, see, Santa's trying his best, but that one's a little hard.
but you're magic.
sometimes what Santa wants to give a good girl like you is patience, because, believe it or not, there are even some things that he can't manage.
you know, there was a girl a little younger than you and she was a little husky.
she was always asking Santy for the same thing:
to make her look more like the other girls.
she wasn't asking to be pretty or nothing.
but she just didn't want to stick out so much.
Santa just couldn't do it.
so instead Santa gave her patience.
and later on, that girl was...
was glad that Santy didn't give her what she had asked him for.
she... She put being husky to good use.
was her name Ricki Lake?
the point is...
I don't think I'm going to be able to give you what you're asking for, even though I'd like to.
but, Santa... - I'm sorry, pumpkin.
it's... It's just not going to happen.
aren't you going to go up the chimney?
on dry runs, Santy uses the Isuzu.
what's going on?
I think I've lost the Christmas spirit.
it's Santa.
I don't know if I can tell you.
I used to believe that Santa could do anything.
if Santa isn't magical,
I don't even know if I want to believe anymore.
it isn't fair that you can't walk, Artie.
I feel so terrible.
Hey, look at me. I'm fine.
Hey, guys, we need you in the teachers' lounge.
Mr. Shue... Brittany's not feeling so good.
Santa thing.
if you don't mind, I think I'm going to take her home, make sure she's okay.
good idea. We'll make do without you.
Hey, uh, so we're your students.
all year long you suffer through dealing with us.
I imagine having some of us in your classes would slowly chip away at your hopes and dreams, until the whole world just felt like a never-ending - nightmare of pain... - Just get to the point, Finn.
right. Uh, anyway, we're here today to help raise money for children that have a lot less than we do.
and I know some of us have had a hard Christmas, but what we've come to learn is that no matter how tough things get, there isn't anything that more Santa or a couple more jingle bells can't cure.
well, Becky, we did it.
we got all my presents back.
and as satisfying as it is to have been gifted enough rotisserie ovens to roast an entire hobo...
for me, the real joy of Christmas was breaking the collective heart of the Glee Club.
what's that, Coach?
welcome, Christmas, come this way.
welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day.
welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day.
welcome, welcome.
welcome, welcome.
Christmas Day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp.
so long as we have hands to clasp.
welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer.
welcome all Whos far and near.
welcome all Whos far and near.
welcome, Christmas.
welcome, Christmas.
welcome, Christmas.
christmastime will always be, Christmastime will always be, just as long as we have glee.
welcome, Christmas, bring your light.
Christmas came anyway, Coach.
it's beautiful.
it is.
how much did we raise?
210 bucks.
and that's after my cut.
I'm kidding.
now that you're divorced and Ms. Pillsbury married another guy,
I guess you'll be spending Christmas Eve alone.
Yes, Rachel, I am.
well, I know how painful being alone can feel, so if you want, you can come over to my house.
we're going to eat Chinese and watch The Main Event.
Thanks, Rachel. I think I'm going to pass.
nothing wrong with being alone.
it's called a Re Walk.
some guy in Israel invented it.
I can't use it all the time, but...
check me out.
where did you get it?
we went home and it was sitting under my Christmas tree.
how the hell did you afford that thing?
I didn't buy it.
I didn't know what it was.
I thought it was a Transformer.
I assumed her dad got it for me, but he has no idea where it came from.
he went to take a long poop, and when he came back it was there.
so if no one we know bought it for you, then...
Santa brought it.
Santa.
a real Christmas miracle.
Hey, Will.
How...How did you get in here?
Oh, I had a key made ages ago.
how do you like your tree?
uh, it's... It's... It's beautiful.
Wh... What's going on? What's with all the presents?
well, you remember that old meanie who stole all that stuff out of the choir room?
well, she's sorry.
Really?
and what made her change her mind?
I don't know. Call it a Christmas miracle and we'll leave it at that.
now I know a lot of these gifts are for orphans or something, but, uh... I got you something special.
it's okay, it's not going to explode.
I thought you might want to put all of us out of our misery and shave off that Chia Pet.
Thanks, Sue.
the tree really does look great.
well, Santa had some helpers.
no one should be alone on Christmas Eve, Mr. Schuester.
too much talking, lady, not enough trimming.
come on, let's get some Christmas up in here.
I thought you hated the holidays.
no, I just hate you.
merry Christmas, Sue.
merry Christmas, Will.
join our FRS and have fun! QQ Group No. 37304379
what happened last week: Quinn told Finn...
I'm pregnant.
but she didn't tell him that he's not the father.
puck is. Can you believe that? - What's up, MILF?
but that's not the only baby drama.
Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking.
and Mr. Shuester doesn't know. - Oh, my God.
also, Rachel quit the glee club because Sue got Sandy to come back to direct a musical.
and that's what you missed on...
william McKinley High Glee Club INVITATIONAL
Quinn, you okay?
I think she just had a bad breakfast burrito.
can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room?
your sexuality?
Rachel... we can't do it without her.
that's not true.
we may have to layer Santana and Mercedes over Quinn's solo but... we'll be fine.
maybe for the invitationals, but not for the sectionals and certainly not the regionals.
the wheelchair kid's right.
that Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing.
Rachel left, guys.
she's gone.
now, if we're gonna make this thing work, we can't look back.
all right, take five, guys.
um, Mr. Shue?
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but, uh...
with all the dancing around that Quinn's doing...
I'm kind of worried about the baby.
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
how about I give Tina a few of her verses, okay?
okay.
you think you might want to tell your mom about what's going on?
I think I'd rather handle it myself right now.
my mom's got enough to worry about.
how come you haven't had any morning sickness?
Quinn Fabray has been upchucking every 15 minutes.
Really?
that's a really good sign.
that means the baby's not a Mongoloid.
well, is it bad that you haven't been sick then?
Oh, no, honey, no, no.
you should ask Howard Bamboo about my Linda Blair impersonations every half hour at work.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this whole Rachel thing.
Hey. Would you like anything else?
another piece of grasshopper pie.
what, are you going for the record?
I'm with child.
Hey, did you go to McKinley High?
I think I had you in my Spanish class.
Yeah, like, five years ago.
I go to Carmel now.
how is that possible?
you must be 22.- Twenty-four.
I'm a sixth-year senior.
they keep failing me so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.
they fail you on purpose?
yeah - Is that legal?
I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.
Yeah. Hey, how about that other piece of pie?
how about it.
honey, are you all right?
Yeah.
fine.
so... have I done something wrong... or...?
Oh, no. No, no. Absolutely not.
no, um, actually,
I've just, um, taken a special interest in you.
look, I know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast, and, uh, you reach a point where you might just need a little, um, special guidance.
has someone told you something about my personal life?
no. Mm-mm.
can you keep a secret?
but, you know, there are very few students that ever get athletic scholarships.
okay? But there are a lot of schools that give full rides to students who excel in music.
students like yourself.
and I don't know, maybe if you were able to go to college, you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town in a dead-end job living hand- to-mouth with a wife and a kid you never intended to have, you know?
for example. That's just something off the top of my head.
so you think if I stuck with Glee that I could get a scholarship?
it's definitely a possibility.
you know? And if you did well at regionals, maybe you could, um, generate some interest.
but we lost Rachel. Do you think we can do it without her?
sure.
do you think we can win regionals without Rachel?
well, remember the Jamaican bobsled team?
big long shots.
definitely.
but if you're concerned about your future and, um, those who may be a part of your future soon, um, maybe you could just give Rachel a talk.
you know, see if you can get her to come back.
how does it feel to be just a sophomore and get the lead in the school musical?
it's an honor.
frankly, one I feel I've earned.
if there's anything I've learned in my 16 years on the stage, it's that stars are rare, and when they're found, you have to let them shine.
show me your bra.
you mean the one I'm wearing?
quid pro quo, Rachel.
if you want a good review, show me your over the shoulder boulder holder.
no way. You can't do that.
my performance will stand on its own.
besides, no one reads the school paper, anyway.
Oh, but I'll post my scathing review online.
you'll be finished on the high school stage.
now, get those sweater puppies out of their cashmere cage.
sorry I'm late.
my Vespa had a flat.
give me a minute and I will be ready for my interview.
we're actually not gonna need any quotes from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson.
do the right thing.
all the great actresses take their clothes off.
well, I have no problem with nudity.
let me tell you about my planned production of Equus.
have you ever hung out at a stable?
Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing. Uh, just...
getting the star treatment I didn't get in Glee.
totally.
it's times like this where I know I've chosen the right path.
I'm never going back to Glee.
it's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.
not gonna get an argument from me.
I'm not?
no. You're, like, the most talented person I know.
even more than that guy at the mall who can juggle chain saws.
I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to run lines with,
I'm available.
th-there is a lot of dialogue.
I figured...
we could go somewhere quiet, maybe with low lighting and...
let me know.
I could get fired for this.
she was a student 15 years ago.
no one is gonna care.
okay.
I - I knew it.
she never graduated.
She-she quit with, like, three credits to go.
Yeah, I,um, I saw her picture in the folder.
pretty.
pretty?
april Rhodes was a goddess.
the most talented performer in McKinley Glee Club history.
when she sang, it was mesmerizing.
she was my first crush.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.
wait, hold on, 'cause I thought you said your wife was your first crush.
well, yeah, that's because April didn't even look at me.
Aw, crap, there's no forwarding address.
s- So then you've-you've had feelings for someone other than your wife.
Emma, I'd love to play This Is Your Life, but Lord Google demands my attention.
okay, just wait-wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
um, reaching back into your past is a dangerous business, okay?
people can change.
they can, um, disappoint you...
I think I can handle it.
I thought I could, too. Just hear me out, hear me out.
a few years ago, I started an online flirtation with a high school flame Andy.
things got weird, and I called it off.
and two months later...
...Versace was dead.
dead.
okay.
april Rhodes... Ohio.
Oh! She has a MySpace page.
Oh, God.
Oh, and here's a link to her own personal Web site.
she's online.
Hi, April.
not sure if you remember me, but my name is Will Schuester.
35 Bontempo Road, between 2: 00 and 3: 00.
bring buffalo wings.
hello. Are you Will?
y - You remember me?
Mm. No, but I don't remember breakfast.
come on in.
so, did I sleep with you?
uh, I was a freshman when you were a senior. No.
so, did I sleep with you?
no
can I get you a drink?
I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.
this is a-a great place you have.
uh, looks like you're doing well for yourself.
I get about five or six appointments on a good day from my World Wide Web page, so I do okay for myself.
why don't you have a seat, take off that jacket, and I'm gonna slip into something a little more comfortable.
so, this is a beautiful five-bedroom with wood-burning fireplace and...
you.
this is the third time this week.
who are you? I'm Sandra with Oak crest Realty.
and she is a squatter.
this is a bank - owned property.
the owners foreclosed six months ago.
let me just get my vino, and I'll be out of your hair.
hold that. - Oh, okay.
just...
nice place.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
what happened to you, April?
in high school, you were really going places.
you had a voice like a dream; everyone loved you.
Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon.
me and my high school sweetheart Vinny were convinced we were going to be stars, so we dropped out of school and hitchhiked our way to the Broadway.
then we ended up in Cleveland slinging hash at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.
then Ralph had an affair with Vinny.
I had a set of mixed-race twins.
and those were the good times.
April... I think your struggle is really moving.
and I want to help you get back on your feet.
I happen to know that you're only three credits shy of your diploma.
I can put you in my Spanish class.
and...
I know you're an amazing singer.
I want you to be in the glee club.
we'll get you sobered up...
find you some underwear.
it's not too late for you, April.
what do you say?
introduce you to someone very special.
this is April Rhodes.
she's our newest member.
wait, so old people can join Glee Club now?
old, huh?
you guys look like the world's worst Benetton ad.
Mr. Schuester, this seems like a terrible idea.
april is a great singer.
and she never graduated.
we appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's no Rachel.
who's Rachel?
Sh-She's kind of our star.
your star, eh?
well, where is she? - She left.
to be the lead in Cabaret.
Hey, Tinkles, give me "Maybe This Time" in B flat.
and don't let me catch you snoozing.
april.
I guess I better pour myself another Crantini.
I'm just kidding. It's hot chocolate.
all right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday.
april, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, Will.
the old noodle just ain't what she used to be.
I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s.
look, April,
I've been, uh, talking to the glee kids, and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around.
you draw a lot of attention to yourself.
and they're embarrassed enough as it is.
so do you think you could maybe take some time and try to win them over?
Yeah.
mm, smells like my Aunt Mildred.
just drink it.
with a bit of an after-burny taste.
Oh, good Chablis should always have a little bite.
now, a few swigs of that every day before school, and you'll have all the courage you need to be yourself.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
that's fantastic.
mm, so is my primo collection of vintage muscle magazines.
want them?
Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind.
april should stay.
I worship her.
I c-can't do this.
I don't understand why we're doing this in the first place.
your lack of imagination astounds me.
this is only the beginning.
if you can master this, you can sneak anything out of a store between your knees.
shoes, prom dresses.
I once got a cake out of a kid's birthday party.
with the candles still lit.
are you sure?
she can stay.
t- T-Totally.
this is terrible.
come hear the music play - This is a disaster - Life is a cabaret - I'm gonna barf.
old chum - Boring - Come to the cabaret - No, no, no, no, no!
I don't know what you want.
well, I know what I don't want.
and it is all of this.
when I gave you this part, I thought you could handle it, but clearly you can't.
what this show needs is a star with a little bit more maturity.
I know what you're trying to do.
you're trying to get me to quit, so you can be the star.
well, it won't work.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll say.
I'm sleeping with him. - So am I.
this play's weird.
that's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.
you're a really good actor, Finn.
maybe you should consider joining the musical.
I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
I don't think I could just walk away from it.
I know how hard it was for you.
but I could justify doing both if you came back.
but we both know that's not gonna happen.
do you know what we should do?
elope?
what? - Nothing.
we should go bowling.
you're always so stressed out about the play.
you just need to loosen up.
I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up about a big game or something.
just us?
Yeah.
Yeah, that-that-that would be great.
I - I am really stressed out.
but that's the price you pay for being a star.
don't I know it.
april Rhodes, Rachel Berry.
Hey, can you give us the room, Rachel?
we need to teach April the cues for "Don't Stop Believing."
wait, she's singing the female lead?
wait, she's in the glee club?
she's... ancient.
talent doesn't age, sweetheart.
that's Rachel's part, Mr. Shue.
well, Rachel's not in the glee club anymore.
Thanks, Finn.
we're all really excited to see the play.
make sure you save us a seat in the front row.
Kurt, I'm a girl who knows her solvents, and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol.
Oh, Bambi.
I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy.
Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out the set list for Saturday.
I just got back from the emergency room.
had them give me four decontamination showers.
I think they call that "the full Silkwood."
what happened?
Kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me.
not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake ID, because he looks like an 11-year-old milkmaid.
will, I think it was April.
her backpack's always clinking with empties.
I'm so sorry.
I - I will, I'll talk to him.
okay.
I'm, um,
I'm a little bit worried about the glee club.
so am I. I mean...
if we don't place at regionals, it-it's all over.
we have obligations as teachers, Will, to give kids opportunities for growth and enrichment.
with April in Glee, you're taking away a kid's chance to grow, and you're giving it to someone whose brain is soaked in corn booze.
april's not finished, Emma.
and if Glee's gonna win, I need to give her a second chance.
she is a talented performer and I really think that the kids are going to learn a lot of valuable technique from her.
okay.
but I think you need to think about...
why you're doing this and what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.
you...
suck!
rough day at the office, cookie?
I've just got a lot on my plate.
it's not easy being in the spotlight.
it's the difficult road I've chosen.
I know that song, sister.
um, do you have any NyQuil?
I could use a little pick-me-up.
these high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be.
that Finn Hudson is one cutie pie I gots my eye on.
Finn's taken, April.
Yeah, well, some guys like a little somethin' - somethin' on the side.
I think your behavior is totally inappropriate and your presence in this school is a complete travesty.
what you choose to do with your life is your own business, but don't go around screwing up everyone else's.
I'm not afraid of you, sweetie.
there was a time when I was the biggest star around here.
and now that I've got that back...
I'm never letting it go.
do I have to put my fingers in the holes?
couldn't there be diseases in there or something?
Oh, no. Ball sharing's all part of the fun.
here, use the pink one.
pink's your favorite color, right?
now what?
follow my lead.
just look at the pins.
nice and straight.
you sure this is your first time?
you see what you can accomplish when you're sober?
sober? I'm rolling on a fistful of horse tranquilizers.
I can't feel my lips.
I think I'm going to keep these shoes.
I brought you here because I need to talk to you.
okay.
I'm concerned that you're a bad influence on the glee club.
I can't have you around if you're going to continue to encourage them to make bad choices.
you're right, Will.
as of right now, I'm back on the wagon.
Really?
that's great.
I have to tell you something.
I was in awe of you in high school.
I mean, of all the roads I never traveled in my life, the one I regret the most was never...
getting the chance to sing with you.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, that's how you get better, you know?
singing with people who are better than you.
you really thought that much of me?
you are the reason I joined Glee Club.
no...
so, your dream was always to sing with me, huh?
Yeah.
well, then, come on.
what? - Come on!
Hey, April, karaoke's on Wednesdays...
tonight's bingo.
shut your gravy hole, Barry.
Hey, guys, uh, happy gambling.
here we go.
this is really good pizza.
Yeah. I think they import the pepperoni from, like, Michigan or something.
how's Glee?
Oh, well, everybody misses you.
they miss my talent.
no, no. We're your friends.
we just miss having you around.
I love Glee, I just...
don't see the point in wasting my energies on someplace that I'm not appreciated.
I appreciate you.
it's your last ball.
just like the first time, but better.
come back to Glee.
what about Quinn?
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
I just know that I want to spend more time with you now.
I'll-I'll have to quit the play.
I'll do it!
maybe Quinn is... There's a lactose intolerant.
that doesn't explain all the crying.
maybe she just doesn't like the group.
are you all that stupid?
Seriously?
I bet you thought Bert and Ernie were just roommates.
maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.
who's the baby's daddy?
who do you think?
Yes, you've heard right... I am returning to Glee Club.
in lieu of flowers, please send all donations to a socially conscious charity of your choice.
this is a hot damn mess.
Oh, my God.
uh, I'm sorry; I thought I'd be welcomed back with a tad more enthusiasm.
sorry, Glee Club has just been rocked with its first scandal.
Quinn's knocked up.
and the baby daddy?
I just wanted to drop off the application for that scholarship you were telling me about.
I got Rachel to come back to Glee, so, I figure we have a real shot at it.
I'm so proud of you.
see what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it?
you're a liar.
why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?
who told you? - Everyone knows but me.
I'm the only fool who went out with you and let you kiss me, thinking you actually had feelings for me.
but I-I do.
look, yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you, but that's different than lying.
well, maybe it's not that much different, but...
but look, I need to get a music scholarship, so I can go to college, so I can get a good job, so I can take care of my kid and I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club.
you should take it as a compliment.
you could have just been honest with me.
look, I know what I did was wrong.
I get that, but... that kiss was real.
whatever it was, it ruined any chance of me ever coming back to Glee.
I hope you have fun playing house with Quinn while you languish in your little ensemble, but my dreams are bigger than that and they're bigger than you.
miss Sylvester.
we need to talk.
if you'd like to to return to the musical, changes need to be made.
well, Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more.
you know, when I heard Sandy wanted to write himself into a scene as Queen Cleopatra,
I was aroused, then furious.
I hereby grant you complete artistic control.
congratulations, kiddo.
you now have everything you could possibly want.
isn't it a great feeling?
the house is packed... you guys are going to kick butt tonight.
your first performance in front of a real audience.
I can't wait. You guys are going to love it.
Where-Where's April?- Yee-haw!
right on cue, as usual.
Hey, roller-boy. Handsome.
Oh, I like that color.
have you been working on the, uh, moves we talked...
you've got something right there, on your...
there's my boy. - Are you drunk?
you promised me you'd sober up for this.
when? Last night?
well, I was drunk. You can't hold me to that.
hit it, knuckles.
april Rhodes almost ran me over in the parking lot just now, Will.
you can't let her go on in her condition.
there is an auditorium full of people waiting to see us perform and if she doesn't go on, none of the kids can.
Wow. It's really great how committed you are to these kids.
now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome McKinley High School's New Directions.
I need to talk to you.
sorry. Baby had to tinkle.
come on. Act two. - No, I can't let you go back out there.
you broke a promise.
you're right.
it's a great moment for me, but it didn't feel right.
I don't belong up there.
but everybody deserves their moment in the spotlight, you know, to shine?
Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will.
and it felt amazing.
like every bad decision I'd ever made just went away.
I was back in the game.
but then I look over and I see these sweet faces of these kids and I think...
I'm hogging their sunshine.
it's their turn now, not yours.
they're so lucky to have you, Will, because you won't let what happened to me ever happen to any of them.
so, where you gonna go?
I'm going to straighten up.
maybe try to find a new dream.
you know, I always loved the Broadway.
the Broadway?
do you think there's a part out there for a washed-up has-been like me?
april, you are not washed-up.
and hey, there's always Branson.
thank you.
no, no, no.
thank you.
Branson, eh?
they loved us! We're a hit.
Wh-Wh-Where's April?
you were right, Mr. Shue.
she'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.
april is amazing.
but she's not in the glee club anymore.
it...
I, uh...
I screwed up bringing her here.
it was about me and Glee Club is supposed to be about you guys.
you don't need her to be great.
but we need her for the second act.
I'll just have to go out there and tell them we had to cut the show short.
Hey, guys.
you were great.
don't worry.
there will be other performances.
excuse me?
I think I might have a solution.
in show business, when a star can't perform, her understudy steps in.
I'd be happy to go in for April, if you'd let me.
since when are you willing to be an understudy?
since I quit the play.
Really? Why?
I realized being a star didn't make me feel as special as being your friend.
if I'd let you down when you needed me the most,
I'd never forgive myself.
I know all the words to the song.
you don't know the choreography.
then we're going to have to give her a lot of help out there.
go get in your costume.
what happened last week: Quinn told Finn...
I'm pregnant.
but she didn't tell him that he's not the father.
puck is. Can you believe that? - What's up, MILF?
but that's not the only baby drama.
Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking.
and Mr. Shuester doesn't know. - Oh, my God.
also, Rachel quit the glee club because Sue got Sandy to come back to direct a musical.
and that's what you missed on...
william McKinley High Glee Club INVITATIONAL
Quinn, you okay?
I think she just had a bad breakfast burrito.
can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room?
your sexuality?
Rachel... we can't do it without her.
that's not true.
we may have to layer Santana and Mercedes over Quinn's solo but... we'll be fine.
maybe for the invitationals, but not for the sectionals and certainly not the regionals.
the wheelchair kid's right.
that Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing.
Rachel left, guys.
she's gone.
now, if we're gonna make this thing work, we can't look back.
all right, take five, guys.
um, Mr. Shue?
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but, uh...
with all the dancing around that Quinn's doing...
I'm kind of worried about the baby.
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
how about I give Tina a few of her verses, okay?
okay.
you think you might want to tell your mom about what's going on?
I think I'd rather handle it myself right now.
my mom's got enough to worry about.
how come you haven't had any morning sickness?
Quinn Fabray has been upchucking every 15 minutes.
Really?
that's a really good sign.
that means the baby's not a Mongoloid.
well, is it bad that you haven't been sick then?
Oh, no, honey, no, no.
you should ask Howard Bamboo about my Linda Blair impersonations every half hour at work.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this whole Rachel thing.
Hey. Would you like anything else?
another piece of grasshopper pie.
what, are you going for the record?
I'm with child.
Hey, did you go to McKinley High?
I think I had you in my Spanish class.
Yeah, like, five years ago.
I go to Carmel now.
how is that possible?
you must be 22.- Twenty-four.
I'm a sixth-year senior.
they keep failing me so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.
they fail you on purpose?
yeah - Is that legal?
I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.
Yeah. Hey, how about that other piece of pie?
how about it.
honey, are you all right?
Yeah.
fine.
so... have I done something wrong... or...?
Oh, no. No, no. Absolutely not.
no, um, actually,
I've just, um, taken a special interest in you.
look, I know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast, and, uh, you reach a point where you might just need a little, um, special guidance.
has someone told you something about my personal life?
no. Mm-mm.
can you keep a secret?
but, you know, there are very few students that ever get athletic scholarships.
okay? But there are a lot of schools that give full rides to students who excel in music.
students like yourself.
and I don't know, maybe if you were able to go to college, you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town in a dead-end job living hand- to-mouth with a wife and a kid you never intended to have, you know?
for example. That's just something off the top of my head.
so you think if I stuck with Glee that I could get a scholarship?
it's definitely a possibility.
you know? And if you did well at regionals, maybe you could, um, generate some interest.
but we lost Rachel. Do you think we can do it without her?
sure.
do you think we can win regionals without Rachel?
well, remember the Jamaican bobsled team?
big long shots.
definitely.
but if you're concerned about your future and, um, those who may be a part of your future soon, um, maybe you could just give Rachel a talk.
you know, see if you can get her to come back.
how does it feel to be just a sophomore and get the lead in the school musical?
it's an honor.
frankly, one I feel I've earned.
if there's anything I've learned in my 16 years on the stage, it's that stars are rare, and when they're found, you have to let them shine.
show me your bra.
you mean the one I'm wearing?
quid pro quo, Rachel.
if you want a good review, show me your over the shoulder boulder holder.
no way. You can't do that.
my performance will stand on its own.
besides, no one reads the school paper, anyway.
Oh, but I'll post my scathing review online.
you'll be finished on the high school stage.
now, get those sweater puppies out of their cashmere cage.
sorry I'm late.
my Vespa had a flat.
give me a minute and I will be ready for my interview.
we're actually not gonna need any quotes from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson.
do the right thing.
all the great actresses take their clothes off.
well, I have no problem with nudity.
let me tell you about my planned production of Equus.
have you ever hung out at a stable?
Hey, what are you doing? - Nothing. Uh, just...
getting the star treatment I didn't get in Glee.
totally.
it's times like this where I know I've chosen the right path.
I'm never going back to Glee.
it's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.
not gonna get an argument from me.
I'm not?
no. You're, like, the most talented person I know.
even more than that guy at the mall who can juggle chain saws.
I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to run lines with,
I'm available.
th-there is a lot of dialogue.
I figured...
we could go somewhere quiet, maybe with low lighting and...
let me know.
I could get fired for this.
she was a student 15 years ago.
no one is gonna care.
okay.
I - I knew it.
she never graduated.
She-she quit with, like, three credits to go.
Yeah, I,um, I saw her picture in the folder.
pretty.
pretty?
april Rhodes was a goddess.
the most talented performer in McKinley Glee Club history.
when she sang, it was mesmerizing.
she was my first crush.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.
wait, hold on, 'cause I thought you said your wife was your first crush.
well, yeah, that's because April didn't even look at me.
Aw, crap, there's no forwarding address.
s- So then you've-you've had feelings for someone other than your wife.
Emma, I'd love to play This Is Your Life, but Lord Google demands my attention.
okay, just wait-wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
um, reaching back into your past is a dangerous business, okay?
people can change.
they can, um, disappoint you...
I think I can handle it.
I thought I could, too. Just hear me out, hear me out.
a few years ago, I started an online flirtation with a high school flame Andy.
things got weird, and I called it off.
and two months later...
...Versace was dead.
dead.
okay.
april Rhodes... Ohio.
Oh! She has a MySpace page.
Oh, God.
Oh, and here's a link to her own personal Web site.
she's online.
Hi, April.
not sure if you remember me, but my name is Will Schuester.
35 Bontempo Road, between 2: 00 and 3: 00.
bring buffalo wings.
hello. Are you Will?
y - You remember me?
Mm. No, but I don't remember breakfast.
come on in.
so, did I sleep with you?
uh, I was a freshman when you were a senior. No.
so, did I sleep with you?
no
can I get you a drink?
I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.
this is a-a great place you have.
uh, looks like you're doing well for yourself.
I get about five or six appointments on a good day from my World Wide Web page, so I do okay for myself.
why don't you have a seat, take off that jacket, and I'm gonna slip into something a little more comfortable.
so, this is a beautiful five-bedroom with wood-burning fireplace and...
you.
this is the third time this week.
who are you? I'm Sandra with Oak crest Realty.
and she is a squatter.
this is a bank - owned property.
the owners foreclosed six months ago.
let me just get my vino, and I'll be out of your hair.
hold that. - Oh, okay.
just...
nice place.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
what happened to you, April?
in high school, you were really going places.
you had a voice like a dream; everyone loved you.
Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon.
me and my high school sweetheart Vinny were convinced we were going to be stars, so we dropped out of school and hitchhiked our way to the Broadway.
then we ended up in Cleveland slinging hash at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.
then Ralph had an affair with Vinny.
I had a set of mixed-race twins.
and those were the good times.
April... I think your struggle is really moving.
and I want to help you get back on your feet.
I happen to know that you're only three credits shy of your diploma.
I can put you in my Spanish class.
and...
I know you're an amazing singer.
I want you to be in the glee club.
we'll get you sobered up...
find you some underwear.
it's not too late for you, April.
what do you say?
introduce you to someone very special.
this is April Rhodes.
she's our newest member.
wait, so old people can join Glee Club now?
old, huh?
you guys look like the world's worst Benetton ad.
Mr. Schuester, this seems like a terrible idea.
april is a great singer.
and she never graduated.
we appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's no Rachel.
who's Rachel?
Sh-She's kind of our star.
your star, eh?
well, where is she? - She left.
to be the lead in Cabaret.
Hey, Tinkles, give me "Maybe This Time" in B flat.
and don't let me catch you snoozing.
april.
I guess I better pour myself another Crantini.
I'm just kidding. It's hot chocolate.
all right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday.
april, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, Will.
the old noodle just ain't what she used to be.
I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s.
look, April,
I've been, uh, talking to the glee kids, and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around.
you draw a lot of attention to yourself.
and they're embarrassed enough as it is.
so do you think you could maybe take some time and try to win them over?
Yeah.
mm, smells like my Aunt Mildred.
just drink it.
with a bit of an after-burny taste.
Oh, good Chablis should always have a little bite.
now, a few swigs of that every day before school, and you'll have all the courage you need to be yourself.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
that's fantastic.
mm, so is my primo collection of vintage muscle magazines.
want them?
Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind.
april should stay.
I worship her.
I c-can't do this.
I don't understand why we're doing this in the first place.
your lack of imagination astounds me.
this is only the beginning.
if you can master this, you can sneak anything out of a store between your knees.
shoes, prom dresses.
I once got a cake out of a kid's birthday party.
with the candles still lit.
are you sure?
she can stay.
t- T-Totally.
this is terrible.
come hear the music play - This is a disaster - Life is a cabaret - I'm gonna barf.
old chum - Boring - Come to the cabaret - No, no, no, no, no!
I don't know what you want.
well, I know what I don't want.
and it is all of this.
when I gave you this part, I thought you could handle it, but clearly you can't.
what this show needs is a star with a little bit more maturity.
I know what you're trying to do.
you're trying to get me to quit, so you can be the star.
well, it won't work.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll say.
I'm sleeping with him. - So am I.
this play's weird.
that's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.
you're a really good actor, Finn.
maybe you should consider joining the musical.
I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
I don't think I could just walk away from it.
I know how hard it was for you.
but I could justify doing both if you came back.
but we both know that's not gonna happen.
do you know what we should do?
elope?
what? - Nothing.
we should go bowling.
you're always so stressed out about the play.
you just need to loosen up.
I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up about a big game or something.
just us?
Yeah.
Yeah, that-that-that would be great.
I - I am really stressed out.
but that's the price you pay for being a star.
don't I know it.
april Rhodes, Rachel Berry.
Hey, can you give us the room, Rachel?
we need to teach April the cues for "Don't Stop Believing."
wait, she's singing the female lead?
wait, she's in the glee club?
she's... ancient.
talent doesn't age, sweetheart.
that's Rachel's part, Mr. Shue.
well, Rachel's not in the glee club anymore.
Thanks, Finn.
we're all really excited to see the play.
make sure you save us a seat in the front row.
Kurt, I'm a girl who knows her solvents, and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol.
Oh, Bambi.
I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy.
Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out the set list for Saturday.
I just got back from the emergency room.
had them give me four decontamination showers.
I think they call that "the full Silkwood."
what happened?
Kurt was drunk and he ralphed on me.
not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake ID, because he looks like an 11-year-old milkmaid.
will, I think it was April.
her backpack's always clinking with empties.
I'm so sorry.
I - I will, I'll talk to him.
okay.
I'm, um,
I'm a little bit worried about the glee club.
so am I. I mean...
if we don't place at regionals, it-it's all over.
we have obligations as teachers, Will, to give kids opportunities for growth and enrichment.
with April in Glee, you're taking away a kid's chance to grow, and you're giving it to someone whose brain is soaked in corn booze.
april's not finished, Emma.
and if Glee's gonna win, I need to give her a second chance.
she is a talented performer and I really think that the kids are going to learn a lot of valuable technique from her.
okay.
but I think you need to think about...
why you're doing this and what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.
you...
suck!
rough day at the office, cookie?
I've just got a lot on my plate.
it's not easy being in the spotlight.
it's the difficult road I've chosen.
I know that song, sister.
um, do you have any NyQuil?
I could use a little pick-me-up.
these high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be.
that Finn Hudson is one cutie pie I gots my eye on.
Finn's taken, April.
Yeah, well, some guys like a little somethin' - somethin' on the side.
I think your behavior is totally inappropriate and your presence in this school is a complete travesty.
what you choose to do with your life is your own business, but don't go around screwing up everyone else's.
I'm not afraid of you, sweetie.
there was a time when I was the biggest star around here.
and now that I've got that back...
I'm never letting it go.
do I have to put my fingers in the holes?
couldn't there be diseases in there or something?
Oh, no. Ball sharing's all part of the fun.
here, use the pink one.
pink's your favorite color, right?
now what?
follow my lead.
just look at the pins.
nice and straight.
you sure this is your first time?
you see what you can accomplish when you're sober?
sober? I'm rolling on a fistful of horse tranquilizers.
I can't feel my lips.
I think I'm going to keep these shoes.
I brought you here because I need to talk to you.
okay.
I'm concerned that you're a bad influence on the glee club.
I can't have you around if you're going to continue to encourage them to make bad choices.
you're right, Will.
as of right now, I'm back on the wagon.
Really?
that's great.
I have to tell you something.
I was in awe of you in high school.
I mean, of all the roads I never traveled in my life, the one I regret the most was never...
getting the chance to sing with you.
Really?
Yeah. I mean, that's how you get better, you know?
singing with people who are better than you.
you really thought that much of me?
you are the reason I joined Glee Club.
no...
so, your dream was always to sing with me, huh?
Yeah.
well, then, come on.
what? - Come on!
Hey, April, karaoke's on Wednesdays...
tonight's bingo.
shut your gravy hole, Barry.
Hey, guys, uh, happy gambling.
here we go.
this is really good pizza.
Yeah. I think they import the pepperoni from, like, Michigan or something.
how's Glee?
Oh, well, everybody misses you.
they miss my talent.
no, no. We're your friends.
we just miss having you around.
I love Glee, I just...
don't see the point in wasting my energies on someplace that I'm not appreciated.
I appreciate you.
it's your last ball.
just like the first time, but better.
come back to Glee.
what about Quinn?
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
I just know that I want to spend more time with you now.
I'll-I'll have to quit the play.
I'll do it!
maybe Quinn is... There's a lactose intolerant.
that doesn't explain all the crying.
maybe she just doesn't like the group.
are you all that stupid?
Seriously?
I bet you thought Bert and Ernie were just roommates.
maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.
who's the baby's daddy?
who do you think?
Yes, you've heard right... I am returning to Glee Club.
in lieu of flowers, please send all donations to a socially conscious charity of your choice.
this is a hot damn mess.
Oh, my God.
uh, I'm sorry; I thought I'd be welcomed back with a tad more enthusiasm.
sorry, Glee Club has just been rocked with its first scandal.
Quinn's knocked up.
and the baby daddy?
I just wanted to drop off the application for that scholarship you were telling me about.
I got Rachel to come back to Glee, so, I figure we have a real shot at it.
I'm so proud of you.
see what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it?
you're a liar.
why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?
who told you? - Everyone knows but me.
I'm the only fool who went out with you and let you kiss me, thinking you actually had feelings for me.
but I-I do.
look, yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you, but that's different than lying.
well, maybe it's not that much different, but...
but look, I need to get a music scholarship, so I can go to college, so I can get a good job, so I can take care of my kid and I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club.
you should take it as a compliment.
you could have just been honest with me.
look, I know what I did was wrong.
I get that, but... that kiss was real.
whatever it was, it ruined any chance of me ever coming back to Glee.
I hope you have fun playing house with Quinn while you languish in your little ensemble, but my dreams are bigger than that and they're bigger than you.
miss Sylvester.
we need to talk.
if you'd like to to return to the musical, changes need to be made.
well, Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more.
you know, when I heard Sandy wanted to write himself into a scene as Queen Cleopatra,
I was aroused, then furious.
I hereby grant you complete artistic control.
congratulations, kiddo.
you now have everything you could possibly want.
isn't it a great feeling?
the house is packed... you guys are going to kick butt tonight.
your first performance in front of a real audience.
I can't wait. You guys are going to love it.
Where-Where's April?- Yee-haw!
right on cue, as usual.
Hey, roller-boy. Handsome.
Oh, I like that color.
have you been working on the, uh, moves we talked...
you've got something right there, on your...
there's my boy. - Are you drunk?
you promised me you'd sober up for this.
when? Last night?
well, I was drunk. You can't hold me to that.
hit it, knuckles.
april Rhodes almost ran me over in the parking lot just now, Will.
you can't let her go on in her condition.
there is an auditorium full of people waiting to see us perform and if she doesn't go on, none of the kids can.
Wow. It's really great how committed you are to these kids.
now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome McKinley High School's New Directions.
I need to talk to you.
sorry. Baby had to tinkle.
come on. Act two. - No, I can't let you go back out there.
you broke a promise.
you're right.
it's a great moment for me, but it didn't feel right.
I don't belong up there.
but everybody deserves their moment in the spotlight, you know, to shine?
Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will.
and it felt amazing.
like every bad decision I'd ever made just went away.
I was back in the game.
but then I look over and I see these sweet faces of these kids and I think...
I'm hogging their sunshine.
it's their turn now, not yours.
they're so lucky to have you, Will, because you won't let what happened to me ever happen to any of them.
so, where you gonna go?
I'm going to straighten up.
maybe try to find a new dream.
you know, I always loved the Broadway.
the Broadway?
do you think there's a part out there for a washed-up has-been like me?
april, you are not washed-up.
and hey, there's always Branson.
thank you.
no, no, no.
thank you.
Branson, eh?
they loved us! We're a hit.
Wh-Wh-Where's April?
you were right, Mr. Shue.
she'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.
april is amazing.
but she's not in the glee club anymore.
it...
I, uh...
I screwed up bringing her here.
it was about me and Glee Club is supposed to be about you guys.
you don't need her to be great.
but we need her for the second act.
I'll just have to go out there and tell them we had to cut the show short.
Hey, guys.
you were great.
don't worry.
there will be other performances.
excuse me?
I think I might have a solution.
in show business, when a star can't perform, her understudy steps in.
I'd be happy to go in for April, if you'd let me.
since when are you willing to be an understudy?
since I quit the play.
Really? Why?
I realized being a star didn't make me feel as special as being your friend.
if I'd let you down when you needed me the most,
I'd never forgive myself.
I know all the words to the song.
you don't know the choreography.
then we're going to have to give her a lot of help out there.
go get in your costume.
my Master has been long waiting for you, please go in.
ko Chun.
brother Wu.
do you have an airsick?
you are still so smart.
let me introduce, she is my wife, Yau.
this is the God of Gun whom I've always mentioned, Lung Wu.
brother Wu.
we haven't seen for 4 years, you've gained much weight.
thanks for the nutrious diet.
my wife always makes me nutrious food.
when my baby is born,
I think I will be a fatty.
don't you think so, honey?
hubby, if you become a fat guy I will dump you
are you treating me that cruel?
kidding.
I'll let you go.
brother Wu, do you know what I have learnt in France for 4 years?
painting.
it's really not bad.
where is the baby?
he's not yet born.
when the baby is born, I can make a better drawing.
don't you agree, honey?
brother Wu, come on.
I'll show you something.
please, sir.
drop it please.
honey, remember to watch the soup.
he always takes my advantage when you are not around.
dagger and Sing become famous now.
I am so happy to know that.
devil of Gamblers Chan Kam Sing is released from prison.
I know, he is allied with a Taiwanese Chau Siu-Chee.
in these months, he's kept calling me.
I didn't take a glance.
Chau Siu-Chee is a nasty guy you've to be careful!
well, he just wants to push me to play a game with him.
I've got an information that he's come to Europe.
do you want?
he may not come to me.
he will.
Mr. Chau, God of Gamblers is living in the farm ahead.
we'll be there very soon.
is he God of Gamblers?
Yes, but he's never taken any photo.
I gambled once with him in the gambling ship 4 years ago.
I will never forget his face.
Mr. Pill about Mr. Chu's Save World Kids Fund.
should we hand it to God of Gamblers?
this is the last will of Mr. Chu.
he thought that Mr. Ko is the most proper person.
I've cooperated with Mr. Chu for ages.
he didn't trust me at all.
he wanted me to hand 16 billion US dollars to others.
Mr. Chu wanted the world's best gambler to handle the fund.
ko Chun is the best gambler in the world.
I am the best.
ko Chun dares not complete with me.
Mr. Chau you're definitely the second best.
I've heard that Ko married a girl who looks like his ex-girlfriend.
what a lover.
they are alike.
I think you've got a wrong place.
there is no God of Gamblers here.
Mrs. Ko.
let me explain.
Mrs. Ko we come to bring Mr. Ko a good news.
Mr. Chu from Taiwan becomes rich because of gambling.
later, he went straight he left a large amount of money after his death.
he established a Save the World Kids Fund of US$16 billions.
and he wanted Mr. Ko to manage the fund.
I've told you, there is no Mr. Ko here.
no God of Gamblers too.
God of Gamblers? I Chau Siu-chee won't believe in him!
why did he put on an air?
Mr. Chau.
shut up!
he hasn't gambled with me.
so he can't claim himself the best.
this fund should be managed by me.
if you want to quarrel please go outside.
or I will call the police.
behave yourself, Mr. Chau.
brother Chau, I support you.
ko Chun hasn't gambled with you,
he can't claim himself the best.
you should manage the fund.
and you?
sure, sure! Whatever you say Mr. Chau.
just please don't shoot me, OK?
I will call police.
leave now, or I'll shoot.
what's wrong?
there is something wrong at home.
brother Wu.
Chun, save me.
Yau.
What'd happened?
they've killed my husband!
stay here, don't go up. I know.
don't you think I am nobody.
get down, get down!
master, be careful!
up there.
how many did you kill?
eleven.
me too.
still one left.
Yau.
brother Five, call the doctor for me.
yau No, we can't make it.
Yau, who did it?
chan Kam Sing led Chau Siu-chee here.
they asked doctor to do the operation and took our son out.
I'll avenge you and our son.
Chun, you have to promise me two things.
if not, I won't leave with ease.
alright, go ahead.
first,
you can't admit yourself to be God of Gamblers within one year.
second,
I won't allow you gamble with others for one year.
Why?
you've lived into seclusion for 4 years.
why do you go back to the troubled world?
Chun, no one is the forever winner.
if you lose, you will lose your life.
and you'll never know who's the best.
Chun, promise me.
Yau...
Mr. Ko chun, have you seen your son?
he is on the desk, let me introduce myself.
I am Chau-Siu-chee of Taiwan Tung Wu Group.
I have found you since last year for a challenge.
but you never give me face.
come to Taiwan and gamble with me.
I bet with my life.
or, you will regret.
I said there is another one left.
Yau, in this world no one can compete with me.
except Cheung Po Shing of Peking.
he changed my cards once.
one year later, I will come for revenge, 1 1 months are over.
in these months.
Chau kept on asking me to gamble with him.
but I promised my wife.
I won't gamble with others for one year and I won't admit myself to be God of Gamblers.
so I went for a tour so as to lessen my hatred.
I have been to the Silk Road.
and I have been to Tai Lak and Ngor Mei Mountain.
but the hatred in my heart hasn't decreased.
there are still 15 days left.
at that time I don't know what I should do.
what? What are you doing here?
why didn't you stop him?
what are you doing?
why did you take photo of me?
I pictured the view only.
stop lying, take out the film.
sister, did he bully you?
none of your business.
take it back or I won't let you go.
Hoi Tong, what's the matter?
dad, he took my picture.
please be reasonable.
you silly girl, he gives you face so he took your picture.
pal, since we would like to take a family picture.
please take one for us.
OK.
thank you.
wait.
dad, Siu Tung just gave you a call.
he said Chau Siu-chee was recruiting fellows to struggle for our territory and he also seized half of our territory in Tainam.
damn it!
I've predicted that the guy would betray me.
he got US$16 billions.
damn it, he isn't giving me face at all.
should we go back?
go back? If we go back that means we are scared?
you go back first and get some buddies to kill him.
I will be right back.
be careful.
damn it.
let's take a picture.
Cheers, come on.
ready.
one, two, three.
pal... come and take a picture with us.
sorry, I've never taken any photo.
he is weird.

go to get some money and buy us some food and some good wine too.
I prefer some expensive ones.
take the money and go OK.
be quick! I want to drink with my friend. Thank you, boss.
pal, be careful with your money here.
it doesn't matter, I've brought many buddies.
I've been in the troubled world for ages.
I scare nothing.
but, you'd be careful OK.
I get my bag first.
hurry up.
this Hoi seems to have an influential backing.
he is the head of Tung Wu Group, lsn't Brother Chau who recruited you last month a fellow under him?
he hated this old man very much.
if he doesn't worry about gossip, he would have killed this old guy.
his watch is very expensive with so many diamonds Is it?
I think he's over US$100, 000 with him.
if there is any accident happened in this ship.
brother Chao will be very happy.
that is right.
why do you stare at me?
broken heart?
how old are you? Do you know what's broken heart?
I am not an ordinary boy.
I've broken with girls for three times.
being brushed off?
for I am too young.
my previous lovers are all over 20.

I think it's better to let him go straight.
I do think so, but men are selfish.
I do think so I hope that you can let him study more.
my daughter is capable too.
I want her to take over my post.
but there is an aggressive man in my group.
I am afraid he won't accept her.
someone sneaked into the ship.

there won't be any marks.
since this casino is equipped with X-ray machines.
when the cards to be sealed it'll be watched through X-ray.
so, no one can change the cards.
it's really safe.
and, no one should bring with guns.
to avoid violent incidents.
the cups are plastic made too.
brother.
what's this? This is made by ivory.
it can escape from the metal detector.
today, all visitors from HK Taiwan, Korea, Japan and USA shouldn't bring in any guns.
Chau Siu-chee, you are a bastard.
I am a bastard who'll give you US$50 million for your luxurious living.
how can you change his card?
take one you like.

I saw Dragon Ball comics in Mainland.
aren't you following?

sorry, it's a bit bigger.
I won't let you take the change 90 million, it's my lucky number.
alright, don't cheat 90 million.
he follows with a big leap.
you've got a spade 2! But it's not the biggest.
do you want to see my card? Sure.
I billion.
alright, I will follow.
I billion is added.
quit.
what? He cheated.
it's not possible! He must have an Ace.
you've guts.
take a rest.
are you alright? I am fine.
I lost all my money.
Hoi Tong and I will get you another 1 billion.
alright, I will win it back.
God of Gamblers judge from your fame, it seems...you've got hollow reputation without basis.
deal.
I worry you would quit.
just $10, 000 OK, I follow.
just 2 and 4? You won't have change.
alright! 10 million.
I will follow.
God of Gamblers, don't be impulsive.
I won't care it's a pair of K or a pair of Q, I will sure win.
have you gone crazy?
that's great! A Crazy God of Gamblers.
you'd be happy.
deal.
there are so many hearts.
I've got 2, 3,4.
and you've got J, Q and K.
it's like a drama.
ko Chun, how much do you have?
about 80 millions.
I want to see your cards.
don't! You can't follow.
Why?
he possibly has got 5 or A.
so he is possibly having a straight flush.
but he's the chance to have straight flush too.
but he should have an ace.
if he's got 2 3 4 5 6, he'll lose 2 billions?
if I have 2 billions, I'll go home.
go home first, you've got 2 billions.
I have 2 billions too? I mean sperms.
OK, I'll show hand.
God of Gamblers is not up to his normal standard.
shit! How bad.
maybe both of them are having covered Aces.
you have no money, open up.
hold it.
brother Wu, please show them the papers.
this is all my wealth including a commercial building worth 10 billions plus 3 houses in Paris, LA and Tokyo and shares too, it worth 15 billions.
I take it as 10 billions
I've to gamble my wealth with you.
how can I know whether they're fake or not?
there are 4 accountants from an international accountancy.
in ten minutes they could estimate the value.
what are you afraid of?
I scare no one.
alright, cover the cards.
no one should walk close to the table.
no one can touch the cards on the table too.
Yes.
turn on the X-ray machine.
nothing can go wrong, I don't want his covered card be heart A.
I am sorry.
I've confidence in you.
master, if you win you've to take me as your disciple.
let's talk after this game.
if I lose, ask him to be your master.
are we agree then, gentlemen?
alright OK! Sure.
ko Chun's paper worths 10 billions.
open it.
show hand.
I don't have that much cash.
you've stolen US$16 billions from the Save the World Kid's Fund.
if you lose, you have to return the fund.
and... I want your eye.
ko Chun, are you so confident?
alright, let's go ahead.
the estimated value is 16 billions.
whoever loses the game eyes should be paid.
God of Gamblers may become a blind massager.
I'm thinking for his future.
alright.
ko Chun.
you have a chance to win me.
if you have a heart Ace.
Chau Siu-chee.
I thought I was smart.
but my card is...
heart A?
Bravo...
master, you are great!
damn it, I may have AlDS.
I thought you were Hoi Tong.
I can't imagine this heart Ace could win your eyes for my wife and Yiu Yiu.
what's wrong? Why hasn't it changed?
don't you think Cheung Po Shing can change my card?
cheung Po Shing.
he isn't Cheung Po Shing.
he is just one of my best friends.
he is the most famous magician in China.
uncle Xiao Ping won in the bridge game with his aid.
you cheated me.
not your turn.
one year ago, I know you haven't die.
I said I was afraid of Cheung Po Shing in front of my wife's corpse.
you can't imagine I would tell lies in front of a corpse.
I set up this trap for one year.
so, you won't regret.
how about that game?
the first one? I have Ace.
I let you win.
he acted in front of you don't you think it's real?
why did you card move through in the x-ray machine?
it's simple.
miss Hoi lent me a hair.
I used the card to cover the hair.
and I moved the hair slightly a kid also know how to play this game.
you are so mean.
I won't blame you of not taking the money for charity purpose.
but you've killed my wife and my son.
how can I stand you? You bloody asshole.
how did you kill my wife.
I would kill you in that way to avenge her.
Bravo, he won't be a blind massager.
thank you, brother Wu.
don't mention it.
Chun.
what's the matter?
I thought you had no tears.
I am afraid you would lose.

Brookfield School. One can almost feel the centuries.
true. -Gray, old-aged...dreaming over a crowded past.
we're in the heart of England, Mr. Jackson. It's a heart that has a very gentle beat.
there's the special train. In 15 minutes, the heart of England's going to have slight palpitations.
get out, you beast. It's mine.
assembly. Assembly. Come on, you boys. Assembly.
hurry up, now. Assembly. Assembly. Assembly.
Carrie primus. -Carrie secundus.
Danvers. -Denville.
Darby.
good afternoon, boys. -Good afternoon, sir.
you may sit down.
well, here we are at the beginning of another school year.
one which I sincerely hope will be a credit to Brookfield.
we require not only to win the matches against Millfield and Sedbury...
...but also, if it's not troubling you too much...
...some fairly decent results in the examinations.
now I have a small disappointment for you.
perhaps you're aware of it already.
for the first time in 58 years...Mr. Chipping has been unable to attend first-day assembly.
chips, and you'll allow me to refer to him as Chips...
...seeing that 37 years ago this autumn...
...he gave me a thrashing for sheer bone laziness.
well, Chips has a cold.
and a cold can be quite a serious thing for a young fellow of 3.
so Dr. Merivale has ordered him to stay at home.
it was quite a battle.
but our old friend was finally induced to surrender...
...and he is now sitting, under violent protest, by his own fireside.
Oh, sir. Sorry, sir. -What is this? A scrimmage?
no, sir. I'm looking for assembly.
Oh, are you? So am l. Hang onto my tail. Come on.
locked out.
well, I'll be
well, we'll have to wait. That's all there is to it.
so you're a stinker? -A stinker, sir?
a new boy. That is what we call them here. "Stinkers."
what's your name? -I'm Dorset, sir.
Duke of Dorset? I taught your father. He was always late. Always late.
look.
here.
ancestor of yours. -Yes, sir.
Drake! Was he here, sir? -Yes.
was he a stinker too, sir? -To be sure, he was.
but he grew out of it, and so will you.
are you a master, sir? -I was a master once.
I've taught thousands of boys, right back to 1 870...
...but I gave it up. Gave it up 1 5 years ago.
I say, you must be terribly old, sir.
well, I'm certainly no chicken.
no chicken.
that's the school song.
it's a beautiful song. -Yes, sir.
Mr. Chipping, we weren't expecting you. -Good afternoon, Martin.
good afternoon, sir! -Rigby, good afternoon.
my governor asked to be remembered. He'll send some grouse.
thank you, Grayson. I shall appreciate that very much.
where did you go for holiday? -I stayed home.
glad to see you. -Thank you, Mills.
the head said you couldn't come out, sir. -Couldn't l?
how do you do, sir? -Collingwoods.
you look more like your father every day.
good afternoon, sir. This is my brother. -Miller? Miller secundus, eh?
Yes, sir.
do they starve you at home, Miller?
Hello, sir. -Hello, Morgan.
still growing out of your trousers? Your grandfather's trousers were short.
runs in the family. Morgans are always three inches ahead of their trousers.
Chipping.
why, Chipping.
sorry I'm late. Interference. Interference. The first time for 58 years.
I told you to stay indoors. -A lot of namby-pamby nonsense.
I'm as sound as a bell, no thanks to you. Ridiculous old man. He's in his dotage.
Mr. Jackson, this is Mr. Chipping. -I thought so.
this is Mr. Jackson, our new history master.
now you can say you've shaken hands with Chips of Brookfield School.
you mustn't let the honor turn your head.
well, here we are.
won't you come in? -Sorry. I must be getting along, sir.
I've got to unpack. Lower school prep at 6: 00.
Oh, of course. That's always the new master's fate.
it's a bit of an ordeal, isn't it, sir? -Well, I found it so when I started in 1 870.
you found difficulty with the boys?
but seeing you just now...? -lt took time.
too much time.
you seem to have found the secret in the end.
what? The secret? Oh, yes, in the end...
...but I didn't find it myself, Mr. Jackson.
it was given to me by someone else.
someone else.
Mr. Jackson, when you go into class tonight...
...to take evening school for the first time...
...remember you're not the first master who stood there and felt afraid.
good night. -Thank you, sir. Good night.
Oh, do come in, sir. Standing out there in the cold.
all right, all right. -There's quite a wind.
Mrs. Wickett, I can do that myself. -Really, sir, not so much as a scarf.
you don't seem to show good sense. Wait till the doctor hears about it.
he has heard about it from me. I gave him a piece of my mind.
you sit down by the fire. What you want is a nice cup of hot tea.
I'll wait a bit. Some of the boys might drop in.
well, I have to pop out for a minute. Everything's ready for your tea.
and a cake? -Yes, there's a cake.
I wonder how many of them those boys have eaten since you first came here.
letting them gorge you out of house and home.
last term, 26 iced cakes, 299 rock cakes, 156 Bath buns
enough of your loathsome statistics, woman.
go about your business. Go.
they ought to feed the boys better.
remember how you used to starve them when you were undermatron?
all that was a very long time ago. Things is different now.
a long time ago.
Yes.
a long time.
things are different now.

I'm Chipping, the new master. -Yes.
can I be of any assistance? -Not now, I've finished.

all right, I'll see to it. In here, Martin. Better get in, Mr. Chipping.

thank you, boys.
Oh, thank you.
sorry, sir.

I wonder where he's going. -So does he.
cheer up.
I'm new too. It's not easy to begin with.
What'd he do, slap him? -Kicked him, most likely.
here we are. Mind your head.
I used to have this room.
you'll find the draft from this window will give you a stiff neck.
what are you looking at? Is something going on?
it's just as I imagined it. It means everything to me, to come to Brookfield.
I suppose you felt the same way. I'll get on. I know I will.
headmaster at Brookfield. That's something worth working for.

ever done any teaching?
Oh, no, no.
come in. -Your bag, Mr. Chipping.
and the headmaster will see you now, sir. -Oh, thanks. Thanks.

a bit of a terror, isn't he?
look out, the old boy. -Wetherby?
trotting out the new man.
this is your new colleague, Mr. Chipping. -How do you do?
I want you to show Mr. Chipping the ropes. He is taking lower school for preparation.
good evening, Chipping. Anytime you need to see me. Good evening.
good evening, sir. -Lower school prep, eh?
it's always the new master first day. -You mustn't let them rag you.
take a look for drawing pins in your chair. -Or rattraps in your desk.
Thanks. I shall manage. -Are you athletically inclined, Mr. Chipping?
not that they ever become violent. I mean, they don't carry weapons.
you mustn't take any notice of these fellows.
the boys are a bit restless the first day.
new masters are an exciting blood sport with them, but
the bell. -You'll have to hurry.
good luck, Mr. Chipping. -We'll keep our fingers crossed.
thank you very much. -Mr. Chipping?
the headmaster has your home address, naturally. Just in case.
have you seen him? What's he like? -New masters are always smelly.
he's coming! -Sit down.
your cap, sir!
let me get it for you, sir! -No, sir, let me!
no, sir, I'll pick it up! -No, sir, I will!
that will do, thank you! -We're glad to help.
do you hear what I say? Go to your places. -I have it, sir. I have it.
it's a bit battered, sir. -Do you lose your cap often?
that's a silly question. -Give that to me!
it's awfully dusty, sir. I'll see to it for you, sir. It won't take a second, sir.
give that to me.
what's your name? -Colley, sir.
colley, back to your place. Back to your places, all of you.
Yes, sir.
you will employ the hour in writing an essay on the book you were given to read during the holidays.
I understand this was Kingsley's Westward Ho!
lf you're in difficulty, I'll answer questions. -Thank you, sir.
sir? -What is it?
ls a pencil all right? -Of course not, idiot!
who's an idiot? -Silence. I'll have no more of it.
no more silence, sir? -Sir?
who was Queen Elizabeth's husband, sir? -She didn't have a husband.
surely you know what she was called? -No, sir. What, sir?
well, she was called the vir-- Well, she was called the
never mind. -Oh, sir. Please, sir.
please, tell us, sir. -Get on with your work.
sir, who was Cadiz? -Who was Cadiz? Who was Cadiz.
cadiz is a town in Spain. -Of course, you ass.
lsn't he an ass? -Don't listen to him.
may I kick him, sir? -Quiet, please. Quiet.
I think we'll get on with our work. -Yes, sir.
well, is a pencil all right, sir? -I don't care what you use...
...only please get on with your work.
Yes, sir. -At once, sir.
sir, how do you spell "armada"? -Can anyone enlighten this boy?
Yes, sir. A-M-A-R-D-A. -No, no, no.
no, it's A-M-A-R-D-A!
Silence! Do you hear me? -Silence! Silence! Didn't you hear me?
the teacher said, "Silence!" Shut up, you lunatic!
boys, do you hear me? Sit down! Be quiet! Sit down, boys!
who did that, sir? I'll kill him for you, sir. -Colley!
what is this?
what is happening?
Mr. Chipping?!
I'm-- I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid l
it is just 18 years ago this term...
...since I had occasion to cane the entire lower school.
the young gentlemen of that day came honestly by their punishment.
I think I can say the same for you.
you will present yourselves at my study tomorrow...
...in alphabetical order at intervals of three minutes starting at 3: 00.
I believe I can promise you that I have lost none of my vigor.
I think you better see me after prayers. -Yes, sir.
our profession is not an easy one, Mr. Chipping.
it calls for something more than a university degree.
our business is to mold men. It demands character and courage.
above all, it demands the ability to exercise authority.
without that, I think any young man should ask himself seriously...
...if he has not perhaps mistaken his vocation.
no, sir-- -When a man is young, Mr. Chipping...
...there are many walks of life open to him.
I hope you don't mean that I should resign. I should be very reluctant to do that, sir.
it means everything to me to come to Brookfield. I'll get on.
please give me the chance to prove it, sir. -I am willing to forget the incident...
...but will those boys forget it? You're going to have to face them again.
that'll take courage. Moral courage.
however, if you care to make the trial-- -Thank you, sir.
I shall watch your progress with interest. -Thank you, sir. I'm deeply grateful to you.
Hello, Chipping. I hear the boys gave you a rough time.
they will not do it again, Mr. Bingham, I assure you.
before we leave I want to wish our cricket 11...
...the best of luck against Sedbury this afternoon.
this year, Sedbury claims to be sending us the finest team that ever came out of a very fine school.
well, we shall give them a hearty welcome.
we shall give them a big tea, but I venture to predict we shall not give them the cup.
the boys are unusually quiet.
what does it mean?
something has occurred. What is it?
well, sir, it's really no business of mine, but
I think, sir, perhaps I can explain. -You, Mr. Chipping?
Yes, sir. I'm keeping my class in this afternoon.
that means Maynard, our best player-- -Please, Mr. Shane.
sir, I'd entirely forgotten about the cricket match.
forgotten? -Yes.
my attention was drawn to the fact by my class in such an insolent manner...
...I thought it inadvisable to go back on my decision.
you observe the effect on the school? -I do indeed, sir. It's most regrettable.
go on! Run it out! Run! Run! -No, no, get back, you ass!
get back! -Get back! Get back!
out!
we've lost.
bad luck, Maynard. -Colley.
all right, sir. Sedbury's beaten us. We've lost the cup.
not just us, it's the whole school.
you don't care how the fellows feel. You don't want to be liked!
perhaps you don't mind being hated!
boys...
...I should like to say that my judgment, in the first place, was hasty and ill-advised.
and no one regrets more than Dr. Wetherby that my authority had to be upheld.
if I've lost your friendship, there's little left that I value.
you may go.
Latton. -Lemare.
Ligbottom. -Miller.
Mitchell.
Wagstaff. -Wallington.
Walters primus. -Walters secundus.
Almighty father, thou who has watched over us and protected us here at work...
...grant that the holidays ahead may be to us a source of rest and refreshment.
and that we may employ the happy time of leisure with grace and wisdom...
...to the greater glory of thy son, our Lord.
Amen. -Amen.
sorry, sir.
and where are you going to spend the holidays?
have a good holiday, Matthews. -Thanks awfully, sir.
where are you going? -Folkestone, sir.
Hey, Johnson, wait for me.
Mr. Chipping.
you remember me? Hargreaves.
of course, I remember you, but you've grown, you know.
do you remember the day we met in the train?
Oh, I remember, yes.
you told me to cheer up, and I nearly drowned you in tears.
it was my first term as well. If you hadn't started first...
...I should have done the crying myself.
I heard that you were leaving here a few years ago.
Yes, I was going to leave. I was going to be a classics master at Harrow...
...but it just didn't happen though.
perhaps I shouldn't mention it, but I rather expect to be housemaster next term.
Woodward is leaving. -That's splendid. Congratulations.
thank you. -I suppose I'm keeping you from your packing. Goodbye, Mr. Chipping.
goodbye, Hargreaves.
glad to have seen you.
well, here we are. Now, who will have a piece?
raven. -Thanks, Staefel.
Ogilvie? -Cake. Where'd you get that, Schnitzel?
lt was a present from my German class. -Good.
I can't understand these English boys.
the whole term, they behaved to me like 59 devils.
then today, they make me a speech, they give me a cake...
...and I burst out of tears.
lnto tears, Staefel. In English the-- -Shut up, Ogilvie. The term's over.
Chipping, cake? -That's very nice of you. Thank you.
mind if I borrow this? -Go ahead.
"H. G. Wells." Never heard of him.
his first. He won't come to much. He's too fantastic.
where do you go for your holidays? -Harrogate. He always does.
Hello, Jenks. Cut yourself a piece of cake.
you will have your little jokes.
headmaster's compliments, sir. He'd like to see you in his study, immediate.
I'll bet that's about taking over Woodward's house.
congratulations, Chipping. -Thank you very much.
you certainly deserve it after all this time. -It's quite a surprise, if it's true.
though, mind you, I had rather hoped.
but I better get along. -Well, good luck.
good luck, Chipping.
see, Chipping.
I knock on wood for you.
Thanks. Thanks.
I expect you've guessed why I wanted to see you, Mr. Chipping.
sit down. -Thank you.
Mr. Woodward's retirement leaves a housemastership vacant.
Yes, sir. -You are the senior master.
normally the vacancy would go to you.
that is why I feel that, in fairness to you, I should tell you personally...
...why the governors and I have decided to appoint Mr. Wilkinson.
we felt that with your unusual gifts of getting work out of the boys...
...that you'd rather concentrate on teaching...
...and leave the rather tiresome job of housemaster to someone...
...with special gifts in that direction. -I understand, sir.
though I doubt if Mr. Wilkinson will ever turn out...
...as many minor Latin poets as you have.
I quite understand, sir.
Yes. I thought you would.
just off for the holidays, Mr. Chipping? -Yes, yes. To Harrogate.
Oh, you are. Well, have a pleasant time.
thank you. -Goodbye, Mr. Chipping.
goodbye.
may I come in? -Oh, yes. Do.
it's got dark, hasn't it?
Chipping, I hear...
ls it true that Wilkinson--? -Yes, it's true.
I'm sorry. -Thank you, Staefel.
I won't say I'm not disappointed because I am.
there it is.
forgive my bursting in. -Yes, of course.
the fact is, I wanted to make a suggestion.
I planned a walking tour to my own country, through Tyrol, to Salzkammergut, to Vienna.
do come with me.
me, go abroad?
you'll like it, I'm sure. You like to climb, you say. The country is beautiful.
it's very good of you, but it's out of the question.
but why? Tell me that.
well, for one thing, I've booked my rooms at Harrogate.
Harrogate! Must you always go to Harrogate?
well, I dare say, I am in need of a change, but
but you don't care for my company. -Oh, no, Staefel. I should be very glad.
as a matter of fact, I often feel lonely.
there is no more to be said. It is settled. -But, Staefel
I'll arrange everything! We meet the train tonight. Pack yourself, Chipping!
Staefel, listen!
Bye, Schnitzel. Have a good time. -Thank you. I shall.
and Chipping is coming with me too. -What, old Chipping going abroad?
to Tyrol, he shall climb!
well, don't break your necks!
such a heavy mist.
it is strange.
so early in the year.
does he know anything of climbing, the English gentleman?
he hasn't climbed for years.
is it safe, do you think?
if he stops still he will be well enough.
but if he's foolish enough to start climbing down...
...there are bad places.
this is a nice business.
I could be here all night.
Hello!
Hello!
good heavens!
a woman.
Hello!
Hello!
are you in danger?
well, upon my word.
Hello!
hello.
I can't see you.
here I am.
hello there. I thought I heard a voice.
are you all right? -Yes, quite. Thanks.
the mist's a nuisance, isn't it? -You're not in danger?
no.
do you mind?
no, of course not, but-- -You shouldn't move about. It's foolish.
foolish? But I heard you call. I thought you needed help.
don't tell me you climbed up to rescue me! -As a matter of fact, I did.
really, I should be very angry. Supposing you'd fallen.
I must say-- -I never head of such utter stupidity!
where were you? -On the Gamsteig.
you climbed in that mist to rescue me when I'm probably a better climber than you are.
well, what were you screaming about? -I wasn't. I just let out a shout at random.
so that was why.
when I think that road might have been paved with your good intentions.
really, it was idiotic of you.
and rather wonderful. -Not at all.
well, anyway, I'm glad you came. It was going to be very lonely.
won't you sit down?
this is quite comfortable, as rocks go.
thank you.
my name is Chipping.
mine's Ellis. Katherine Ellis.
won't you have a sandwich? I've got loads here.
this one is...
...ham. -Thank you.
I ate mine early. I am rather hungry.
I'm sorry I wasn't in any danger.
it was rather inconsiderate of you.
what are you doing alone on the mountain? Isn't it unusual for a young lady?
I'm not usually alone. I have a friend at the inn.
so have l. We're on a walking tour. -Really? We're bicycling.
bicycling? Through Austria?
good heavens, I didn't know ladies rode those awful things.
I'm afraid so.
with one leg on each side of the saddle?
well, you don't imagine I ride sidesaddle, do you?
what happens to your...
...dress?
Oh, they breed female bicycles now, didn't you know?
ladies riding bicycles.
I don't approve of this rushing around on wheels.
the other day a man passed me at 15 miles an hour!
you know, humans were never intended to go that speed.
I suppose you think I'm old-fashioned.
I like men to be old-fashioned.
have another? -You're sure?
thank you.
we reserve these for emergencies.
it's chilly, isn't it?
Oh, I say, I should have thought of it. I'm so sorry. Here.
do have this. I'm rather warm. -I wouldn't think of it. Put it on.
you must have it. Really. I insist. Please.
why don't we share it? It's big enough for both of us.
no. Someone might see you. -On this mountain? What if they did?
but I don't need it. Really, I don't. -I insist. Look, like this.
take hold of it. There.
don't worry. We'll find our friends.
if a search party's going, I insist on coming.
but l-- -That's final.
a penny for your thoughts.
Oh, as a matter of fact, I was thinking of you.
kindly, I hope.
I see very little of ladies at Brookfield. I was rather realizing what I missed.
if I may say so, I think the ladies have missed a great deal too.
it's very kind of you, but I'm not a ladies' man.
afraid of them? -Terrified.
not of me, I hope. -No, not up here in the clouds.
perhaps the altitude's gone to my head, but at the inn
because I'm a strong-minded female who rides a bicycle?
Oh, no. No, on the contrary.
because-- -Because?
well, because you're so very nice-looking, I think, and charming.
so are you, Mr. Chipping, frankly.
good heavens, no one has ever called me that!
what extraordinary ideas come into one's head up here.
it's the altitude. -Do you experience a sort of exhilaration?
definitely. -As though we owned the mountain?
to put it mildly. -We're pretty superior persons.
we're gods!
up here there's no time...
...no growing old...
...nothing lost. -We're young.
we believe in ourselves. -We have faith in the future.
it must be the altitude.
do you suppose a person in middle-age could start life over again...
...and make a go of it?
I'm sure of it.
quite sure.
it must be tremendously interesting to be a schoolmaster.
I thought so once.
to watch boys grow up and help them along...
...see their characters develop and what they become...
...when they leave school and the world gets hold of them.
I don't see how you could ever get old...
...in a world that's always young.
I never really thought of it that way.
when you talk about it, you make it sound exciting and heroic.
it is.
and the schoolmaster?
is he exciting and heroic too?
I've met only one...
...a reckless person...
...who climbed the Glockner in a mist to...
Oh, look!
the mist is lifting.
we can go down now.
Yes.
I'm almost sorry.
it was an adventure, wasn't it?
it was.
well, back to reality!
I see them! They're together, look!
you are right!
Hello!
Hello! -Hello!
it is Kathy!
Oh, thank heaven! Come on!
and to the special health of the hero of the mist.
der hochwohlgeborene Herr Von Chipping.
Herr Von Chipping!
Servus!
but I did nothing. Nothing at all.
modest fellow. The minute I let him out of my sight, he becomes a hero!
Oh, nonsense. This is absurd. I merely-- -You were wonderful, I'm going to kiss you.
my dear young lady, really, I'm at a loss.
miss Ellis, good night. I hope you'll be none the worse.
good night, why? -I'm rather tired. I think I'll go to bed.
to bed?
no, no, no, no. I have food for you. A goulash, strudel.
perhaps you can send it up to my room.
good night, you wonderful man. -Good night.
thank you again, you were very kind.
not at all.
good night. -Good night.
good night, everybody. -Good night!
good night.
let us have a song. Something gay for the Fraeulein.
thank you. That's sweet of you.
Katherine, what are you doing?
looking at my mountain in the moonlight.
I should've thought you'd seen enough of it.
it's going to be a rather thrilling memory back in Bloomsbury.
it's a pity your knight errant was such an old stick-in-the-mud.
flora! -He might have been young...
...and splendid-looking. Then you would've known you'd met your fate.
he isn't at all old, darling. And I think he's quite charming.
Kathy! -I mean it.
he's just shy, Flora.
and a little difficult to know, perhaps.
I'm sorry for shy people.
they must be...
...awfully lonely sometimes.
Chipping, you should have stayed. It was quite a party.
I'm not much good at that sort of thing. -A pity.
they wanted so much to give you an evening.
they did?
I didn't understand. I hope I wasn't rude.
Oh, no. They understood.
miss Kathy asked me to say goodbye and to thank you again.
goodbye? -Yes. They're going away...
...early in the morning. On their bicycles.
well, I'm sleepy. Are you coming?
Yes.
you are so silent. What are you thinking?
that was a very intelligent young woman, Staefel.
she was a very pretty one, Chipping.
I wonder if we might run into them again on our travels.
well, we must look out for two bright new bicycles.
english ladies, quite English.
it is them.
they're acquaintances of mine. Will you give them my card, please?
tell them I'd like to have a word. -Certainly, mein Herr.
hardly dressed for ladies, are we?
shall we not ask them to lunch with us? -I don't see any objection.
the ladies are here.
is this the person?
well, you stated that you knew me. -Madam, the fact is
did you tell the porter we were acquainted? -No, not exactly.
not exactly!
did he or did he not?
what is your purpose in accosting us? -Madam, I had hoped
you had hoped?
well, this isn't the first time we've been subjected to unwelcome attentions.
but I warn you, young man!
if I so much as set eyes on you again...
...I shall place myself and my friend under the protection of the British Consul!
why do they call it the Blue Danube? It looks brown to me.
there's a legend, you know.
Yes. The Danube is only blue to the eyes of...
...well, to people in love, you know. -How so.
you surprise me.
Vienna's a pretty big city, isn't it? -Pretty big.
lots of tourists go there, I suppose. -Droves of them.
Chipping?
the Danube doesn't by any chance look blue to you, does it?
what do you mean? Nonsense!
you do talk the most infernal rot sometimes, really.
only two weeks more.
it seems such a little while.
let's not think about the end till it comes. -lt has been fun.
and now Vienna.
don't you hope it's gay and romantic?
well, they say it is.
but then they said the Danube was blue.
but, Flora, dear. It is blue.
thank you.
thank you.
miss Ellis, well!
and Miss-- Oh, well of all the...
well, how do you do? -Why, Mr. Chipping.
and, miss, how are you? I'd just about given you up.
I hoped I'd run into you. -And now we have.
extraordinary. -We always meet in a mist.
we do, don't we?
Oh, yes, of course. I'm so sorry. We'd better move on.
Staefel, I say. Staefel!
I found Miss Ellis. And on the boat all the time.
well, what a surprise.
Oh, yes, of course. Come.
just think, it was in this ballroom...
...that Prince Metternich drew up the treaty of the five kingdoms nearly 199 years ago.
doesn't that interest you?
I must confess, the historical significance of the ballroom doesn't impress me at all.
whenever in days to come I think of this place, and I shall think of it...
...I shall say that's the place where I dined with...
...well, with you.
thank you, Mr. Chipping.
tell me, are those two...?
do you think they're...? -ln love?
no.
well, I wouldn't know.
have you never been in love, Mr. Chipping?
no. Oh, yes. Yes, I was once.
Oh, I thought so.
rather a long time ago.
I was 14 at the time.
she was the greengrocer's daughter.
and Papa and Mama intervened, I suppose. -Yes. So did the greengrocer.
pity this all has to end tomorrow.
for us, but not for you.
you have three weeks more.
Oh, yes, yes. That's true, but...
it's been wonderful.
for me too.
what will stand out in your memory?
I don't know.
Schoenbrunn and the emperor driving by, the whipped cream...
...the music.
what will you remember?
I really can't say.
shall I tell you?
can you? -The waltz you danced in Vienna.
waltz I danced-- What? When? -Tonight. Now.
Oh, but I couldn't possibly. I don't dance.
good heavens, I haven't danced since college.
are you turning me down?
in front of these people? No, really. It's out of the question.
well, of course, if you'd really rather not.
it would have been fun just once before going home.
miss Kathy...
...may I have the pleasure of this dance?
I shall be happy, Mr. Chipping.
did I drink too much wine?
liking it? -Loving it.
as much as you'd hoped? -And more. You're doing splendidly.
now reverse.
reverse? -Round the other way.
evening dress is very becoming to you, Mr. Chipping.
you approve? -Heartily.
wonderful, isn't it?
reverse.
miss Kathy, a penny for those solemn thoughts.
I was thinking of tomorrows and railway stations...
...and goodbyes.
I hope you'll have a comfortable journey. -I hope so too.
what time do you get to London? Oh, I asked you that before.
lsn't saying goodbye awful? -Yes.
know what I mean? It's so
Oh, it is. Very, very.
rather a crowded train, isn't it? -You said that before too.
did l? It's saying goodbye, you know.
I know. It's awful.
miss Kathy? -Yes?
I wanted to say something to you.
dear, it's time. -Come along. Goodbye, Mr. Chipping.
can't you remember?
I wanted to say that you made this the most wonderful holiday of my life.
Kathy! -Miss Kathy?
you must go.
goodbye, Miss Kathy. -Goodbye, Mr. Chips.
miss Kathy!
Kathy! Kathy!
you kissed me! -I know. It was dreadful of me.
no. But do you--? Are we--? Oh, this is awful.
look here, you'll have to marry me now, you know.
do you want to? -Do I want to? Do you?
Dreadfully! Goodbye, my dear.
Kathy! Oh, you can't go now, my dearest! -Goodbye.
Bye!
she's gone.
I don't know where she's gone.
I may never see her again. -I shouldn't worry, Chipping.
miss Flora has selected the church already, and I'm to be best man.
my good fellow, do you imagine that we were both blind and deaf?
we are going to open a bottle of champagne at the first cafe that we come to.
married at St. James' Church, Bloomsbury...
...Katherine Mary, only daughter of the late Henry Forbes Ellis...
...to Charles Edward Chipping of Brookfield School.
Brookfield School? -It's not possible.
Chipping? It can't be! -See for yourself.
fantastic!
Hey, Staefel, you sly old dog, did you know about this?
of course I know. -I suppose she's elderly.
I would hardly call her that. -Plain as a post, I suppose.
my dear fellows, please, she's Chipping's choice.
ls it as bad as that? -No. Do I give a wrong impression?
she's a good creature.
her nose is perhaps a little red.
good God! Does she drink? -No. It is only indigestion.
well, I'm off. -No, please.
I told Chipping to bring her to meet you this afternoon.
you must be kind to her, for Chipping's sake.
he's bringing her here? -He might have kept her to himself!
women aren't allowed in this room.
I hear them.
I must say, this is a nice start to a term.
hello. -Congratulations!
Congratulations! -Thank you.
my wife would like to meet you. May I bring her in for a moment? Kathy.
these are my colleagues.
Mr. McCulloch, Mr. Baucovy, Mr. Raven...
...Mr. Porter-Watson, Mr. Hildersley, Mr. Murdoch.
it's so nice to meet you all, and a little terrifying.
won't you sit down? -Yes, yes. Do, do.
I oughtn't to break in to a private room.
no, no. Not really. -lt isn't private.
certainly not. -Chips told me it was terribly private.
chips?
my dear, I told you not to. It's just a nickname she's given me.
chips! Why didn't we think of that?
you will stay and have some tea with us, Mrs. Chips?
well, thank you. I don't believe-- -Really, you must. I insist.
well, then I'd better pour it out. -I'll get some more cups.
may l? -Thank you.
McCulloch doesn't drink tea. -Nonsense! Of course I do. Frequently.
see her? -ls she old?
shut up!
can't see if you keep shoving me. -Who's shoving?
what's all this, you kids? -Mrs. Chipping's in there.
what's she like?
she's not much older than some of us, and she calls him "Chips."
made him buy a new suit and trim his mustache.
poor old Chipping, it'll kill him.
quick, they're coming!
Hello, sir. -Good evening.
are these some of your boys, dear? -Yes.
Hello, Matthews, Winthrop
colley, sir. -Colley. There's always a Colley here.
brown and the rest of you, this is Mrs. Chipping.
how do you do, Mrs. Chipping?
I hope we'll meet again soon. In fact, I know we are.
Mr. Chipping wants to give a tea party every Sunday.
what?
it would be nice if you boys start the ball rolling next Sunday.
thank you very much. -Thank you.
you said 4:00, didn't you, dear? -Oh, yes, of course.
4:00 then. We shall look forward to it. Good night.
good night, Mrs. Chipping. -Goodbye, Mrs. Chipping.
not bad, eh? -She's pretty.
pretty? She's wonderful.
now, Bullock, you can't find room for just one more muffin?
no, thank you. Really, Mrs. Chipping.
last muffin means a handsome wife and 19,999 a year.
I should risk it for the sake of the future Mrs. Bullock.
Mrs. Bullock! -Mrs. Bullock!
why, Martin, you hardly ate anything. -I'm in training.
he's one of our best footballers. He'll get his colors next term.
Really? Do you think we'll beat Sedbury? -We ought to.
the Sedbugs are funks anyway. -What, Mitchell?
Sedbugs. That's our name for them.
Oh, I see. What do they call you, the Brookfleas?
if you do win, Mr. Chipping and I must give you a feast of victory.
you'll wear vine leaves and eat muffins lying on couches...
...Iike the ancient Romans.
I'm sorry to interrupt your classical lesson, but there's the bell...
...and these ancient Romans will be late for chapel.
I haven't enjoyed a party so much for ages. Come again soon.
Oh, thank you. -Thank you.
now, don't be late for chapel, or you'll get us into trouble.
no, we won't. -Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir.
goodbye. -Goodbye.
goodbye, sir. -Goodbye.
goodbye, sir. -Goodbye.
what a nice lot they are. -They certainly are when you know them.
though what authority I shall have in class after these orgies
ten times more because now they look on you as a friend.
what a revolutionary you are.
try one of those jokes you've kept hidden away, see what happens.
no. There's a limit, even to revolutions.
a woman...
...of the plebeian class.
can anyone tell me what is the Lex Canuleia?
it was the law that allowed patricians to marry plebeians.
as a matter of fact, it was a very handy law...
...because if Mr. Patrician told Miss Plebs he was very sorry he couldn't marry her...
...after they'd made the Lex Canuleia...
...she probably replied, "Oh, yes, you can, you liar."
Canuleia!
that's enough. That's enough. That's enough. Thank you.
Bullock!
it's very kind of you to show such violent appreciation of my joke...
...but we mustn't return you to your parents with a broken blood vessel.
Mr. Pickwick was sufficiently fired with Mr. Pott's enthusiasm...
...to apply his whole time and attention to the proceedings
lights out.
are you taking dormitory inspection? -Yes, shan't be long.
chips! -Yes?
cough a little before you come to number 11.
now, Kathy, why?
jones Minor got a box from home today. Did you ever have a dormitory feast?
well, I do remember once, but that's beside the point.
is it?
I think you're trying to pull Brookfield down stone by stone.
thought I heard a noise.
must have been the cat.
merry Christmas, sir. -Thank you.
bullock, go easy on the mince pies. -Merry Christmas.
say goodbye to Mrs. Chipping for me. -Yes.
I'm bringing Mrs. Chipping silkworms. -How very nice. Thank you.
mater hopes you'll see us, sir. -I will.
my uncle's taking us to the Drury Lane pantomime.
then you'll see Dan Leno. I believe he's even funnier than I am.
beg your pardon, sir. The headmaster says, would you see him in his room?
at once? -Yes, sir.
Yes, of course. Well, goodbye. I must go.
goodbye, sir. -Merry Christmas.
what do you suppose the head wants with me?
there. How do you think it looks, Nellie?
Oh, it's ever so beautiful, ma'am.
Kathy! Where are you? -I'm here, dear.
Kathy, such news! They're making me housemaster.
Longhurst's leaving, the head's offering me his house.
darling!
Oh, darling. I'm so happy.
not that it's any more than you deserve.
Longhurst, it's a lovely old house. It's 18th century, isn't it?
Yes, I believe so.
there's a most imposing library for you and a greenhouse with a grapevine.
we ought to have lighter paint in the hall. It's a little gloomy.
now, now.
the bedrooms are lovely.
there's a little room I always thought would be perfect for the nursery.
you always thought? -But of course, dear.
I was sure you'd be housemaster one day, just as I'm sure that one day you'll be head.
I've been trying to make up my mind which of the houses I like best.
the presumption of the woman! -lmagine.
Longhurst will have to be called Chipping's now.
Chipping's? Oh, of course. Yes. Well, well.
Oh, I'm so proud.
I do believe you really meant it too. -Meant what?
I might be headmaster one of these days.
my darling, you're a very sweet person and a very human person...
...and a very modest person.
you have all sorts of unexpected gifts and qualities.
so unexpected that you keep surprising even me with them.
never be afraid that you can't do anything you've made up your mind to.
as long as you believe in yourself...
...you can go as far as you dream.
certainly you'll be headmaster, if you want to.
don't move. I've brought something for a celebration.
Max, what a lovely surprise.
it isn't every day our friend becomes a housemaster.
we haven't drank wine together since that evening in Vienna, remember?
the beautiful Blue Danube.
the Danube would certainly be blue for both of you tonight.
to Herr Von Chipping of Chipping's House...
...and to Frau Von Chipping, the most sweet lady in the world.
and to you, dear Max, we shall never forget you.
what was it we said in the cafe that night my hero rescued me?
Servus?
Servus, Max. -Servus.
now you shall make a toast, Miss Kathy. -What shall I say?
I know.
Max, Chips, to the future.
to the future. -To the future.
Yes, sir. Is it true that lady spiders eat their husbands?
with certain species, yes. -Be careful not to marry a spider, Colley.
well, thank you, sir. We mustn't keep you, sir.
it was jolly decent of you to explain it.
can't think what boys are coming to.
april the 1st, and they stand around and ask silly questions about spiders.
when I was their age, a master's life used to be a purgatory on April Fools' Day.
well, times are changing. I must be off. See you at lunch.
ls it over? -No.
no. I'm afraid it's going to be a bad time.
I must go back at once. I came down to tell you...
...that we're doing everything we can. I'll come back again directly as possible.
it's best for you to stay here, old man. Please.
what's all this? -Bring the postmark across this letter.
it's an April fool for Chips.
he'll think they're really letters, only they're nothing but blank paper.
I don't see much in that. -That's the point. There isn't.
chips will see the joke. He's good at seeing jokes lately.
have you heard the news? Chips is having a baby.
chips is? -Mrs. Chips, you fool.
just like old Chips, he would have a baby on April Fools' Day.
Mrs. Chipping?
Yes, Nellie, and the baby too.
I'll send the message to the common room. Someone else can take your class.
it's all right. -But, Chips, there's no need
he came in!
please, sir. There are a lot of letters for you.
thank you, Henley.
first of April, sir! -April fool!
april fools!
will you turn to page 29?
Colley?
colley, will you begin?
the Roman ambassadors...
...crossed...
...from Carthage...
...as it had been commanded to them...
...into Rome...
...into Spain...
...in order that they might approach the state...
...and entice them...
...into an alliance.
Owen. -O'Hara.
Pearson. -Pringle.
pendennis.
Ewart.
Ellison.
Easton.
Eddington.
Fairbank.
Finch.
Fortescue.
we've got a new telephone at home. -Does it work?
no.
Beddington. -Bickersteth.
bell.
stinks volunteered for South Africa. -Crikey, that's tough on the Boers!
Smith. -Simpson.
I'm going to Queen Victoria's funeral.
won't it seem funny having a king?
Lewis. -Livingston.
Logan. -Lister.
did you hear? Some French chap's flown the Channel.
Mansfield. -Maxwell.
Martin. -Mitchell.
Hey, boy, you! Come here.
well, haven't you got a name? -Yes, sir.
ls it a secret? -No, sir. It's Morgan, sir. Derek Morgan.
Oh, a Morgan, eh? I might have known, trousers too short.
morgans always grow out of their trousers. Run along.
Yes. -The head would like to see you.
Oh, he would, eh? Thank you.
you'd better take over for me, will you?
you beast! I'll kill you for that.
Hey, hey! Boys, boys! Get up! Stop it! Stop it at once.
get up! Get up! Come on. Get up.
a disgraceful exhibition.
did no one ever tell you to keep your hands up? Keep them up.
it's a wonder both your eyes aren't closed. New? What's your name?
Colley. -A familiar name at Brookfield.
my grandfather's John Colley, chairman of the school governors.
he's a scrapper too. Caned him more than once. I'll do the same for you.
what's your name? -Perkins, sir.
I gather you're engaged in the vegetable business.
do your duties include brawling? -He called me a town cheese.
he said I was a stuck-up snob. -A "town cheese"?
that was ill-mannered of you, Colley.
shake hands. No more of this nonsense.
I've got to get along. Hurry up.
that's better.
if you knocked some sense into each other, the afternoon hasn't been wasted.
come in, Mr. Chipping. -Thank you.
sit down. -Oh, thanks.
have you ever thought you would like to retire?
no, I've never thought about it. -The suggestion's there for you to consider.
the governors would grant you an adequate pension.
I don't want to retire. I've no need to consider it.
in that case, things will be a little difficult.
why difficult?
do you want me to be quite blunt? -Oh, yes, of course.
look at that gown you're wearing. It's a subject of amusement to the school.
I told you I wanted the new style of Latin pronunciation taught...
...and you totally ignored it. -Oh, that. Nonsense, in my opinion.
what's the good of teaching boys to say "Kikero" when they'll still say Cicero?
instead of vicissim, you'd make them say "wekissem."
I'm trying to make Brookfield an up-to-date school...
...and you insist on clinging to the past.
the world's changing. -I know the world's changing, Dr. Ralston.
I've seen the old traditions dying one by one.
grace, dignity, feeling for the past.
all that matters today is a fat banking account.
you're trying to run the school like a factory for turning out moneymaking snobs!
you've raised the fees, and the boys who really belong have been frozen out.
modern methods, intensive training, poppycock!
give a boy a sense of humor and proportion, and he'll stand up to anything.
I'm not going to retire. You can do what you like about it.
he told Chips he's got to retire, but Chips said he wouldn't.
I should think not. He's been here hundreds of years.
he used to cane my father. -lf Chips went, the school would fall down.
I never heard such rot. -What's the rumpus?
Ralston wants to kick Chips out. Says he's got to retire.
what? Get rid of Chips? He just better try.
if he says another word to Chips, I'll kill him.
the governors don't want you to resign.
Brookfield wouldn't be the same without you.
you can stay here until you're 199 if you feel like it.
we hope you will. -We do indeed.
sir John, gentlemen...
...it is good of you, John, of all of you...
...to take this trouble for an old man.
but before I avail myself of your confidence...
...I should like to persuade the head that in these times...
...Brookfield has need of both of us.
that's generous of you, Chips. But will it work?
I'll shall see to it that it does.
I'm even going to teach my Latin class to say Kikero!
a few years of that, and I'll have to retire.
five years ago this summer, when I was new to Brookfield...
...I ventured to suggest to Mr. Chipping...
...that it was time for him to retire.
I was as new as that.
I even persuaded him to replace the venerable garment...
...that had become another Brookfield tradition.
today, no one regrets...
...more sincerely than I do...
...that he finally feels himself compelled to take my hint.
I invite you all to join me in a toast...
...to Chips of Brookfield!
to Chips of Brookfield!
school! Three cheers for Chips.
Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah!
Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah!
Hip-hip-hurrah! -Hurrah!
we all know that Mr. Chipping's retirement is a great loss to Brookfield...
...but we hope that he will have many long and happy years.
I'm not going to tell Mr. Chipping what we paid for the present...
...because, well, that's rude.
I believe he'd like to know that every boy in the school subscribed to it...
...and every subscription was collected without force of any kind.
Mr. Chipping, we want you to accept this little token of esteem...
...from the boys of Brookfield.
it's meant to keep biscuits in.
boys of Brookfield...
...I'm afraid Wainwright has been guilty of exaggeration...
...in speaking of my services to Brookfield.
but then, of course, he does come of an exaggerating family.
I remember I once had to punish his father for it.
I gave him one mark for Latin translation...
...and he exaggerated it into a seven.
I've seen a good many changes at Brookfield.
I remember so much...
...I sometimes think I ought to write a book.
what shall I call it?
memories of Rod and Lines?
I may write it one day.
I may forget some things, but I never forget your faces.
if you come and see me in the years to come, as I hope you will...
...you may see me hesitate.
you'll say to yourself, "The old boy doesn't remember me."
but I do remember you, as you are now.
that's the point.
in my mind, you remain boys...
...just as you are this evening.
sometimes when people speak of Sir John Colley...
...our chairman of governors...
...I think to myself, ""Yes, a jolly little chap with hair that sticks up on top...
...and absolutely no idea of Latin verbs."
although I am resigning, I shall still be near the school.
I shall live at Mrs. Wickett's house, just opposite Main Arch.
well, remember me sometimes.
I shall always remember you.
I need not translate it for you.
well, good night. And thank you.
glad you won't be far away. -Anytime you need me.
I shan't hesitate.
and, Chips...
...when you write that book of yours...
...remember that in addition to all those boys you taught...
...you managed to teach something to at least one headmaster.
goodbye.
good night, Jenks. -Good night, sir.
we're all sorry at losing you, sir.
thank you, Jenks.
do you know, sir, I always kind of thought that you'd be headmaster here one day.
did you?
well, so did...
...someone else once.
any news, Jenks? -Oh, nothing very much, sir.
an Austrian archduke's been murdered. -Oh, dear.
well, good night, Jenks. -Good night, Mr. Chipping, sir.
it's the Manchester Regiment. They're off to the front.
isn't it exciting, sir?
is it? Well, I suppose it is.
I bet those tommies wish they had a band like ours.
there were sentries on every bridge at home, with bayonets fixed.
my uncle saw the Russians come through.
how did he know they were Russian? -Easy, Wes.
they had beards, and snow on their boots.
I say, Waterhouse has joined up.
Waterhouse?
Yes, sir.
but he only left last term.
how long do you think it will last?
why, Forrester, you thinking of joining the army?
I will as soon as they'll have me. -lt'll all be over long before they do that.
but I'm 16 and a bit, sir. -I know, Forrester.
but I'm afraid you won't have a chance.
it can't last. Stands to reason.
it's a question of weeks.
sorry to disappoint you, Forrester.
tonight adds to the roll of honor...
...the names of 11 boys and one master of Brookfield School...
...who have given their lives for their country.
John Forrester of the Northumberland Fusiliers.
killed while counterattacking the enemy in the salient at Ypres.
he left here to join the army at the age of 17 years and 6 months.
he was moved up into the line on his second day in France...
...and two days later was killed in action.
richard Kingsley of the Warwickshire Regiment.
fell leading a bombing raid upon the enemy trenches.
Kingsley was captain of the school in 1909 and entered Sandhurst.
Colley. -I wanted to see you.
I'm off to France on Friday.
martin Rutherford and John Passmore were friends.
they came here together in the same term...
...they joined the flying corps together...
...and died upon the same day...
...covering the infantry attack upon Delville Wood.
so you see, Helen's going to be rather lonely while I'm out there.
I say, this is an awful thing to ask you.
go on. Go on, Colley, please.
well, she's going to live at Charborough.
the kid's nearly a year old now.
I'm just wondering whether you'd run over and see her once in a while? It's not far.
I'd feel terribly happy if there were someone she could see.
of course, Colley. Of course.
Oh, it's awfully good of you, sir. The address is here.
you're doing me a great honor.
here's an old friend of yours, Chips.
you don't remember me, Mr. Chipping, sir?
why, bless my soul, if it isn't the town cheese.
perkins is my batman. We're off to France.
Really?
you're not fighting each other this time?
it's a great bit of luck for me, sir, being with Mr. Colley.
well, goodbye to you both.
God bless you.
don't worry about, you know.
I'll keep an eye on them both for you. -Thank you, sir.
goodbye.
my goodness, sir, you are late.
there's two gentlemen waiting for you, and they're in a dreadful hurry.
we're going to give you a shock, Chips, so you'd better hang on to your chair.
we're going to be in a bad hole next term.
and you know half the masters have joined up...
...and the substitutes are a dreadful lot.
I know. I know it's difficult, yes.
and now the head wants to go himself. If you feel equal to it, will you come back?
me? -Yes.
no man living knows the school as you do.
our governors want you to be headmaster...
...and to hold the fort until the war is over.
the headmastership?
will you, Chips?
Yes. Yes, I'll come.
you were right, my dear.
I am headmaster after all.
I congratulate you. Smart parade and a fine-looking lot of boys.
thank you, general.
very important, this OTC work. These lads are the officers of tomorrow.
I prefer to hope, general, that tomorrow never comes.
Burton, I understand you've been impertinent and disobedient to Mr. Smith.
I've written the lines. I've done the punishment.
providing you do the punishment...
...you think yourself entitled to play stupid practical jokes, is that it?
sit down.
I want to know why you do this kind of thing.
I do it because the whole crowd of masters here are weak-kneed women.
they're not in the army because they're not fit to be, or too old.
they get it back on us by being tyrants.
before you go on with your interesting speech, get over that chair.
get over that chair.
get up.
sit down.
you'll find the armchair the most convenient now.
it didn't amuse me to do that, Burton.
very soon now, you'll be an officer in France.
you'll need discipline from your men.
and to get that, you must know what discipline means.
now, you despise the masters here...
...because they're not young enough or strong enough to fight...
...you might like to know that every one has done his best to join.
we take no man unless he has done that.
I'm headmaster now because every man fit to be headmaster's fighting in France.
I'm a wartime fluke. A temporary officer risen from the ranks.
but I'm going to keep Brookfield together until the war is over.
you understand? -I didn't know that, sir, about the masters.
I'm sorry.
if I thought you hadn't any good in you, I shouldn't have told you.
now, are you gonna stand in and do your share?
of course I am, sir. -That's right.
look, there it is. There.
look, over there. -It's a cloud.
searchlight's got it. -The guns, they must have spied it.
here, out of this, you kids. Down to lower school.
put those blinds down.
get to your places. Put them down.
at this particular moment...
...in the world's history...
...it may seem to you that...
...the affairs of Julius Caesar...
...in Gaul 2000 years ago...
...are of somewhat
somewhat secondary importance.
but believe me, you can't judge the importance of things...
...By the noise they make.
is there anyone who would like to volunteer to construe?
Maynard? -Yes, sir.
turn to page 49 and begin at the bottom line, will you?
this was the kind of fighting...
...in which the Germans busied themselves.
you see?
these dead languages do come to life sometimes, don't they?
they were going at it, hammer and tongs.
game as a pair of fighting cocks.
one of young Colley's eyes was closing. "Keep your guard up," I said.
Yes, I can hear you. -Oh, dear.
no, thank you. I always eat too much when I come here, you know.
well, young Colley, that's a fine mess you've made.
this fellow must come to Brookfield, Helen.
of course. The Colleys have gone to Brookfield since Queen Anne died.
here, little pig. You precious little pig.
Peter always asks after you in his letter. -We're even then.
his letters to me are full of you.
well, I must be off if I'm to catch that bus.
Oh, I'm afraid so. I'll get your coat. -Thank you.
well, goodbye, young fellow. Goodbye.
and don't choke yourself. Bye-bye.
aren't the colors marvelous this autumn?
I like to think he'll be back before the leaves fall.
there's every hope, Helen. Hope of peace.
beats me how any fight could last so long with a Colley in it.
think of living without fear again.
without trembling at the sight of a letter or telegram.
I know.
I try to imagine him about the place again...
...doing some commonplace thing.
working in the garden, perhaps, or washing the dog.
I can't imagine I shall ever get used to the joy of it.
surely, we shall never again take our happiness for granted.
goodbye. There's no one I'm so happy to see as you.
goodbye, Helen.
next time I come, I'll expect to find the three of you.
there's that bus. Goodbye. Hi there. Hi.
from every point comes news of hope.
we can say at last without fear that the end is in sight.
but even in victory, we have cruel news to bear...
...Iosses that are the more tragic...
...because peace is so close at hand.
Peter Colley...
...Iieutenant in the Coldstream Guards...
...was killed in action during a trench raid on the night of November the 6th.
he remained in full view of the enemy in order to rescue his batman...
...who had fallen fatally wounded.
both men died before they could be brought in.
it is a great honor to Brookfield that His Majesty the king...
...has posthumously awarded Lt. Colley the Distinguished Service Order.
none of you here will remember Max Staefel.
he was German master at Brookfield from 1 899 until 1 992.
he was very popular here, made many friends...
...among whom I was proud to include myself.
I received a letter from Switzerland this morning...
...informing me that he had fallen advancing with the Saxon Regiment...
...on the 18th of October last.
the Saxon Regiment? Does he mean that he was fighting for the Germans?
must have been.
funny reading his name out with the others. After all, he was an enemy.
one of Chips' ideas, I suppose.
he's got lots of funny ideas like that.
Yes, sir. He should be just coming out of school now.
I expect him at any moment.
hold the line, sir. Here is Mr. Chipping.
from London, sir. Col Morgan.
yes? Oh, hello, Morgan.
Yes.
Yes. Yes, of course.
it was good of you to call me.
thank you. Goodbye.
pardon me, sir. Anything wrong?
ask Mr. Melford to be good enough to assemble the whole school in Big Hall.
boys, the war is over.
there isn't any answer.
knock again.
what shall I say? -Say, " Here I am, Mr. Chips."
here I am, Mr. Chips.
what on earth?
I can see you're there.
what is all this?
they told me you wanted to see me, sir.
Oh, so they told you, did they?
that's quite right. I did want to see you.
come along inside and have some tea.
come along.
I've warmed the pot.
would you fetch me the kettle? -Yes, sir.
thank you.
so you're a new boy?
Yes, sir.
name? -Colley, sir.
young Peter Colley?
why, yes, sir.
I knew your father.
Yes, sir, my father was here, and my grandfather.
Yes, of course.
one.
two.
and one for the pot, eh?
all right. Pour away.
steady, steady. Don't drown it.
draw up that chair, will you? -Yes, sir.
two lumps? -Please, sir.
sit down.
here you are. Have a piece of cake.
thank you, sir.
now...
...what do you think of Brookfield?
Oh, it's big, sir.
you'll like it, though, when you get used to it.
it's not half such an awful place as it seems the first day.
a bit afraid of it, I expect? -A bit, sir.
so was I to begin with.
but that's quite a while ago.
sixty-three years, to be exact.
try one of those sponge cakes.
won't you come to see us someday, sir? You'd like my mother. She's funny.
I mean, she makes quite good jokes.
she does, eh? I'm glad of that, Colley.
it's good to have a mother that makes jokes.
I know those hills of yours quite well.
I was there one autumn when the leaves were turning.
beautiful colors. Green and red and gold.
I'm afraid that's the bell for call-over. You'll have to go.
Oh, must l, sir? I'm sorry.
just walk by the master and call your name.
don't let it scare you. -Oh, it won't now, sir.
school doesn't seem half so bad after that lovely tea.
you must come again one day, Colley.
will you let yourself out? I'm a little tired.
Yes, of course, sir.
thanks awfully.
goodbye, Mr. Chips.
goodbye, Mr. Chips.
headmaster of Brookfield.
Ainsworth. -Attwood.
Avenmore.
the Danube would certainly be blue for both of you tonight.
to the future.
first of April, sir. -April fool!
Barnard. -Bryant.
Benson.
killed in action.
Cooper. -Craven.
castle. -Colley.
better send for the headmaster. I promised to let him know.
whittaker, stop that bell tonight. Mr. Chipping's very ill.
Yes, sir.
poor old chap.
he must have had a lonely life, all by himself.
not always by himself.
he married, you know. -Did he? I never knew about that.
she died a long while ago. -Pity.
pity he never had any children.
what was that you were saying about me?
nothing at all, old man. Nothing at all.
we were just wondering when you were going to wake up out of that beauty sleep.
I heard you.
you were talking about me.
nothing of consequence, old man. I give you my word.
I thought I heard you saying it was a pity...
pity I never had any children.
but you're wrong.
I have.
thousands of them.
thousands of them.
and all boys.
goodbye, Mr. Chips.
goodbye.
[ENGLlSH]
good morning, upper east siders.
gossip girl here.
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Oh, my god.
you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl."
someone saw Serena getting off the train at grand central.
I thought everything was good between us.
it was...before I found out you had sex with my boyfriend.
I didn't come back for you.
look, Blair's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend.
and she loves you.
you'd really go out with some guy you don't know?
well, you can't be worse than the guys i do know.
well, our kids were bound to meet. It's a small island.
are you sure it's not some ploy, your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you?
do you ever feel like our whole lives have been planned out for us, that we're just gonna end up like our parents?
man, that's a dark thought.
your mother and I didn't work this hard so you can just make things up as you go along.
it's a facility for the disturbed or addicted.
the question is, what do you do now?
I was thinking...total social destruction?
and here I thought you were getting soft.
it's because of their excellent program that a student here with us today is clean and sober...
at least, for now.
she's in rehab?
no, it's not her. It's her brother who's there.
I know I said some things about you and your world, and I'm sorry.
why did you leave without saying good-bye?
I didn't know how to be your friend after what I did.
I'm so sorry.
spotted in central park -- two white flags waving.
so what will it be -- truce or consequences?
sorry, but you're not on the list.
of course I am.
this is my dream!
not anymore.
Oh, Serena, it's so wonderful to see you.
Hey, upper east siders.
there's nothing gossip girl likes more than a surprise, and we hear Blair Waldorf's got a 2-for-1 special.
her mom Eleanor, who just returned from Paris, and Serena Van Der Woodsen, brunch buddies.
Hey! You're up.
did we have plans?
darling, it is impolite to interrupt.
I was just telling Serena that Bendel's is interested in carrying my line.
Really?
Oh, that's fantastic!
why didn't you say something?
I came back from Paris early to put together my look book, and if they like what they see, it could be the beginning of an entire lifestyle collection.
because more people should be like you, mother.
before you tuck into that, you find a low-fat yogurt more appealing.
I lost 2 pounds when you were away.
and you look marvelous.
wow, these are beautiful, Mrs. Waldorf.
well, they will be if they're not all squished from traveling.
darling, please.
Serena, you have to come back later when everything is unpacked.
I would love to hear your thoughts. You do have such great personal style.
Oh, thank you, but i don't think we'll be able to.
Blair and I have plans today.
we do?
Serena and Blair might have plans for the day, but Nate and Chuck are fully booked for the weekend...
if they survive it.
found it. - Piaget.
can't you just call it a watch?
if it costs more than 10 grand, it earns a proper name.
how about this?
definitely that.
babe Ruth's called shot -- the most famous homer he ever hit.
better safe than sorry.
here we go.
you've lived through ivy week and hopefully gained entry to the college of your choice.
now let's ruin those chances.
let me remind you of the rules.
as of this moment, there is no outside world that I do not show you.
you eat what I provide, practice what I preach, and till I say so, the only girls you talk to are the ones I've paid for.
Yeah!
let the lost weekend commence!
one, two, three, twins!
who brought the Sasquatch?
isn't that Carter Baizen?
I haven't seen him since he was a senior and we were in the eighth grade.
he looks intense.
are you high?
he looks like Matthew McConaughey between movies.
the guy's a loser.
look, anyone who trades their trust fund for a fanny pack flies in the face of all that is holy to Chuck Bass.
Nate Archibald, is that you?
Baizen, my man! I heard you went rogue!
and lived to tell about it. - Hey.
seems like someone's itinerary didn't leave room for interlopers.
doesn't Chuck know a party isn't a party until someone crashes?
Oh, god.
I forgot what it was like to be with you.
no, they were looking at both of us.
don't insult me.
it's been like this all morning, starting with your lovely visit with my mother.
she didn't even call me to tell me she was coming home.
well, she was busy.
she was rushing to get home and everything because she wanted to see you.
she didn't even wake me up.
well, you know how Eleanor feels about beauty rest.
she likes you more than me.
she does not. You are her daughter.
she doesn't like anyone more than you. She just...
I don't know, doesn't know how to show it sometimes.
okay, I'm going inside. Wait for me. I'll be right back.
Humphrey! Dan! Hey!
Hey!
Oh, my god, this is what I love about this city...
you're always bumping into people.
what are you doing here?
Oh, I'm just on my way back from my mom's, dropping Jenny off up in Hudson.
picked up a couple of Cubans for me and my dad...
sandwiches, not cigars.
Hey, uh, remember you said, uh, we could get together sometime and, um, not talk?
I was just wondering, is it "sometime" yet?
that was disgusting. The D. O.H. Should shut them down.
the bathroom? - No, the people.
it's Called Nolita, not no showers.
what are you doing here?
do I smell pork?
and cheese?
okay, well, when you're done with your charity work, why don't you come find me?
I'll be at tory burch looking at ponchos.
isn't that the girl that told the entire school.
and, oh, several colleges -- that you had a drug problem?
Yeah.
but, you know, Blair can be a little...
Blair. - Yeah, yeah.
we're actually trying to work things out.
today's our first day hanging out together alone.
so I should probably get back.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. That's... - yeah.
but, um, call me sometime so we can get together and do that thing you didn't ask me to do.
so I don't understand. The last time I saw your sister, she said your family had locked you out and you'd fallen off the face of the earth.
I didn't. I just fell off the face of theirs.
but once you turn away from money you see it doesn't buy you freedom, it pays for your prison.
they say I disappeared, but all I did was break out.
Where'd you go? - Where didn't I?
I aided the cleanup post-Katrina, spent a year rebuilding Machu Picchu.
which, let me tell you, it's changed my life.
I bought an H. D. Cam and started filming it for a documentary.
you're the guy who gave us our first joint, snuck us into our first club, and you're gonna tell me the life of youtube film maker is better than this?
you invented the lost weekend.
Hey, who cares about a party when you can travel the world?
exactly.
in the real world, the only thing that matters is who you are, not what you own.
as muchas I love the speech about not needing material things from a guy who has that much product in his hair, this party is about excess, not exposition.
stop talking.
start partying.
now here is something that doesn't need material.
as a matter of fact, it's about to come off.
who's with me?
I think I'm just gonna hang here for a bit.
fine.
I'd hate to break up a matched set anyway.
how about we continue this over some cards?
none of this crap these kids are playing.
Texas hold'em is dead.
you know, I'll show you some real action.
you know what?
I'm in this weekly game in this, uh, corner in queens.
it goes all night.
it's the real deal -- high stakes, big money, people with the kind of stories that would put mine to shame.
you should - -you should come.
Yeah. - Yeah?
this one missed her cue at the Chlo' show because she was throwing up a pear.
Ugh. She was in Vera's "vogue" spread.
I don't use Vera's models.
none of these are right.
well, that's because you're looking at the high fashion book when you should be looking for a new face
you know, someone who looks good in your clothes.
someone in this book, like I told you.
I hate the American apparel effect.
but they're closer to what you need.
they're -- they're now, they're hip.
if this person is supposed to represent Waldorf designs, you have to find me someone...worthy of the clothes.
someone like me.
someone like...my daughter.
well, why not her?
you want your line to represent the Waldorf lifestyle.
who better to represent you than one of your own family?
she was my first dress form.
she'd love to!
I would?
Yes.
it's perfect.
Eleanor Waldorf, meet the new face of Waldorf for Bendel's.
Yay!
is that a smile we see on B.'s lips?
the spotlight's on her for once, and S. actually helped her get it.
I guess miracles can happen.
it's gonna be so hot.
the clothes are gorgeous.
they're all right.
Oh, shut up. They're amazing.
I'm just doing my mom a favor.
the hair and makeup test is tonight.
I think this is my best pose.
that's because you can't see what you look like.
you're just a hand model, and that's it.
the right way is this.
girls, no. This is how you do it.
no, no, no.
gotta curve your spine forward, elongate.
Oh, no. You guys are doing it all wrong.
look, you're missing the key. - Show us.
look, look, look. You gotta put the hand on the hip and pop.
pop. Pop. - No, like this.
Hello?
Uh-huh, who's this?
Oh!
who'd dare interrupt the Vander Woodsen as she teaches?
I said, "who?" Give me my phone!
Dan Humphrey. - Who is it?
I'm sorry. The number you've dialed is no longer in service.
stop it! Who is it?
I'm doing you a favor.
look, I can hear you. Can I just please talk to Serena?
apparently, you can, cabbage patch.
come on. Let me have it. - God.
Hello? Dan! Hey.
I'm so, so sorry about that.
and I'm so, so ready to hang up.
Blair was just playing.
you have my full attention, I promise.
good, 'cause I was calling to ask you to not talk with me at a movie tonight.
tonight? Where? What time?
the sunshine, 7: 00.
I'd love to.
uh, I'll see you there.
see you there.
it's complicated, isn't it?
I can't stop staring at it.
it's difficult work.
I mean that in the best way.
it's enigmatic.
it reminds me of an early Bacon or Schnabel.
the artist is in Hudson.
I've represented her for some...
time.
Rufus.
Bex Simon.
I've heard a lot about your gallery.
I wasn't expecting a piece like this from a former rock star.
I prefer"one-hit wonder."
what turned you gallerist?
I've always had artistic pursuits.
we have something in common.
I always pursue artists.
I've been in Brooklyn all day looking for work for a client.
I'm a buyer.
I didn't think I'd find a piece like this, and I don't thinkit' ll be here long.
I'd to put it on hold.
may I?
Yeah, of course.
what time do you close?
I'll stay open.
good.
thank you.
what is Carter still doing here?
I invited him.
or he invited himself?
that is his style.
begging us to break free of our prisons while stuffing his face with free food and draining our booze.
he's a dead beat and a hypocrite.
and a good ballplayer, if I remember right.
you sure you just don't wanna lose to him there, Chuck?
maybe if your d...bought you a basketball team instead of a hotel, you'd have some skill.
look, this is the lost weekend for juniors, not senior citizens.
go jump into a volcano.
let's just settle it on the court.
let's settle it right now.
Hey, chill out.
no, this is my game. I pick the players.
I get it. I'll go.
Hey. Hey, man.
is that card game tonight? - Yeah.
Hey, text me the address later. - I will.
you didn't have to do that, man.
nobody wanted him here.
he's an older brother bringing everyone down.
let's just play some ball.
okay, Blair, relax. Chin down. Hold it there and...
okay, you ready?
okay, one more. This time, let's exhale.
jump around, loosen up.
now really loosen up on this one. Let's relax into it.
now give me the biggest pose you've got.
that's it. Come on, big! Let's think big, big, big.
okay, take a break. Thank you very much.
who chose this girl?
Eleanor. Why?
she's so prim and stiff, like a bookcase. It's unnatural.
Yeah, but she looks stunning in the clothes, don't you agree?
Mm-hmm, to my eye, like a goddess.
to this eye? Bleh. Like a statue.
this is retail. It's not editorial. She needs to let go, have fun, loosen up.
how's the client going to like the dress if the model doesn't even like herself?
Hey!
first of all, you look amazing!
I know.
but look, can I give you a little tip?
how did I know this was coming?
no, no, look, all you need to do is maybe you could, uh, loosen up a little, you know?
shake it out.
um, maybe you could be goofy, like when we were 10.
and we would dance around to "genie in a bottle" in your mom's clothes.
help me. Help me.
um, okay.
act like a tiger, okay? Come on.
Rawr! - Rawr.
no, no, you gotta roar. Rawr!
Rawr!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Give me more tiger! Give me more tiger! You're in that jungle.
Rawr! - You're a savage!
now let's do a prettier one this time, okay?
you're Venus in the half shell, right?
so just look up...
let's do something crazy like Britney with the umbrella.
okay, Britney with the umbrella. Go!
Rawr! - At the car! At the car!
posh spice in America. Ready? Go! That's "cyborg spice" to you.
okay, you gotta pout more and strike.
remember, I taught you the hand on the hip.
strike it and pop.
come on, give me more, give me more, you sexy beast.
Oh, it looks so good!
you're doing so good! You got it!
