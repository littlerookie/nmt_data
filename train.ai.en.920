I'm gonna wait until my partner shows up. We're gonna wrap this up.
and then the medics from the fire department are gonna come here and get you out of here.
does that sound good? - Yeah, that sounds great.
McNally. - Great.
how's she doing?
laceration's deep. I think her leg might be broken, but it's fairly clean.
we got another problem. They got a high-rise fire on east lakeshore. All fire and medics in the zone are there.
what about us? - They're sending units from district 3.
that's over 30 minutes away. I mean the girl's leg is bleeding like crazy.
McNally, you've been trained. You know what to do.
get pressure on the wound, patch it up to stem the bleeding.
and do what you gotta do to keep her calm and conscious until the medics get here. Okay? All right?
Yes.
where are you going?
the debris goes about a hundred yards up. That's where the shots came from. I'm gonnnn have a look. Here's the bag.
okay.
change of plans.
what are you talking about?
don't worry. It's gonna be fine.
seven hours earlier， this is all wrong. What are we even doing here?
what is wrong with it? It's a studio, great neighborhood. It's most importantly, in your price range.
Yeah, it's facing north. It's not bright enough.
you know, this isn't just a condo I'm buying, Traci. It's my future.
and my future needs a lot of natural light.
it doesn't even have parking. - You don't even have a car.
future me does.
is future you hooking up with Sam Swarek?
inappropriate.
you knew it was gonna come up eventually.
Luke and I just broke up.
Yeah, over a month ago. And I know you're still in mourning.
but sometimes the best way to get over somebody is to get under somebody else.
again, completely inappropriate.
it's not your training officer anymore.
no way. Okay, those are not in my plans. And I'm still a rookie.
and, you know, just getting out of this relationship, I gotta lie low and get my act together.
how long's that gonna take?
I promise if anything happens, you'll be the first to know.
good, especially if you want to see that bright future of yours.
okay, we gotta get outta here. We have three more places to look at before shift starts.
they're all facing south. One of those places is gonna be my new home.
Really?
what makes you so sure?
just have a feeling this is gonna be a good day.
10 minutes, 30 seconds.
I can see the time. Don't need you to keep reminding me.
is that our game console?
it's my game console.
well, you're erasing all my high scores.
we're just using it as a prop. I'm teaching Dov to defuse an I. E.D. using a controlled blast.
fun.
sue doesn't think I can do it, but I've already grounded the C-4s in place. And I got the detonator.
good. Now you just have to secure the det before you're timed out.
boom. You're done.
but I still have two minutes.
you put the detonator in your mouth.
if it sparks, it's got enough charge to blow off your face.
and I would hate it if something happened to this face.
it's a remote detonator. I guess you're both dead.
can't say I miss wearing one of those.
well, that's because you never made it look as good as I do.
flattered as I am, uh, tell me you didn't come down here just to watch me suit up.
what do you know about James Brennan?
forget it, man. He's out of the life, has been for years.
it's all about the wife and the kid. And the car garage in Brampton.
not anymore.
wife and daughter were killed in a car accident two months ago.
intel says Jamie is not doing so well.
and you think now might be a good time to try to work him?
Sammy, this guy is an enforcer. He's a serious player. This might be our only chance.
I'm putting together a team of guys who know the case.
when?
a couple weeks. - A couple weeks?
got a guy who could make an introduction, get you in the inside, working for him. We'll take it from there.
and here's me just getting used to sleeping in my own bed again.
as good as you think it makes you look, the uniform's a straitjacket for you.
okay, well, I'm gonna let you think about it.
officer Nash. - Detective Barber.
didn't see your car in the parking lot. Thought you called in sick after your big game last night.
what, me? Never. No, I just dropped it off in the shop for a-a little tune-up.
Stella's feeling a little under the weather?
no, I just thought I'd get her shipshape In case, I,you know, sell her.
what are you talking about? That car's your baby.
it's just a car.
besides, why drive a chick magnet when you already have the woman of your dreams?
very smooth, detective.
Oh, you see that? I just exude cool. I don't need a hot sports car.
you know, if you have to point it out, it's a lot less cool.
y... You're right.
so you and Sue seem pretty happy.
Yeah, we are. She's, uh, she's great.
it's good. It's good. You know, the fact that she's E. T. F. Doesn't make you feel uncomfortable.
I mean, that's something, you know.
Nope. Like I said, she's great.
look, about what happened, I just wanna be clear.
what do you mean?
you don't remember?
why am I not surprised? You were totally high, and it's not like you meant what you said.
of course not. Let's just forget it happened.
okay. That's a good plan.
she's lifted six purses in the last two weeks. So when you bring her in, keep your hands on your wallets.
moving on.
I spoke to headquarters this morning about the new squad cars.
Yes! Bring to the equalizers.
forget about the, uh, equalizers. They say it's not on the budget this year.
I know. It means that we're gonna be driving the same smelly, broke-ass cars for the next year or two.
so serve, protect, and drive careful. They gotta last.
looks like I'm with Oliver, and you have 1507 with Dov.
Yeah, can you switch with me? I wanna ride with Oliver.
are you sure? You know you're gonna have to buy him lunch, right?
Yeah, I know, I know.
and listen to those CDs of his cousin's blues band?
yeah? So? I like them. They're... Bluesy.
all right.
I'm riding with you. Gail wants to switch.
great. We can go to that restaurant with the bacon-flavored curly fries.
dude, yes. - Dude.
that your new place? - Yeah. I'm trying to decide between these two.
I still think this one feels way more me, though.
I know that building. It used to be a toilet factory.
well, it's not anymore. It's actually very nice. - Yeah?
it's comfortable, quiet. If you got any problems, just take the back off and rattle the chain.
anyways, I'm going to the bank tomorrow morning.
first-time buyer. So I get a 4. 5% fixed rate on a 30-year mortgage.
30 years? - What, you think I should do 35?
well, it's just a hell of a commitment.
well, I'm obviously not gonna stay there for 30 years. You know, stay for five, wait till it appreciates, flip it, then move to another neighborhood, do the same thing. And eventually I'll have my great place in the beaches.
the beaches.
5-year plan, 10-year plan. You got it all figured out.
Yeah. Plan's good.
bet you were one of those kids that saved her Halloween candy and made it last all year, huh?
what, and you were the kid that ate all his candy in one night?
no, just the good stuff. Then I threw the rest out.
see, you can't do that. You gotta save the good stuff.
save it? What for? For what? - I don't know. Later.
okay, so I just need you to look up.
what are you doing?
listen, you might have a concussion. So I just need to make sure that your pupils are equal, and reacting to light.
I just have a couple questions, okay? - Okay.
okay, what do you do for a living?
I'm a musician. I'm a songwriter.
Really? Like, on the radio?
not all songwriters are on the radio.
I guess.
I have a bunch of demos. Nothing's 100% finished yet.
I don't want to put anything out until it's ready, you know?
Yeah, that's totally understandable.
okay, I'm gonna try to clean this up. It might hurt a little bit.
gotta get the glass out, okay? - Okay.
all right, so, um, what else do you have to do? You know, what's left?
I just have to do a couple more tracks...and then
I'm finished probably, like, in the next two months or so.
Really? That's right around the corner.
I know.
Yeah, ah, I have this really amazing bottle of champagne, just sitting in my apartment, waiting for me, to celebrate when I'm done.
well, that's gonna taste great.
Yeah.
why is it bleeding through?
I don't know. - Wasn't it supposed to stop?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I have to wrap it a little bit tighter.
Oh, my god，oh, my god.
okay, okay, okay, here's what's gonna happen. Just relax, okay?
I'm gonna wrap a little bit tighter. And then if that doesn't work, uh...
I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it and cut the blood flow, okay?
no, I don't want... - No, no, no, it's okay.
I don't want you to touch it anymore. I just want you to leave it. - I know. I know.
it's not gonna be long now. I promise. It's okay.
55 minutes earlier.
thank god you're here.
he shot Ricky. This is Partytown. This isn't supposed to happen.
just, uh, start at the beginning and tell us what happened.
well, I was getting changed out back, you know, trying to keep the magic alive.
when, uh, I saw the office door was open, and I poked my head in.
there was a guy digging through the desk.
he took the cashbox over $4, 000, and then he shot Ricky.
I guess I surprised him.
I'd be surprised, big chicken coming at me.
before I could say anything, he took a shot at me. I fell back, and he ran out the back door.
did you see what he looked like?
hard to tell. I had the chicken head on.
white, 30s maybe.
it happened pretty fast.
I'm used to getting kicked and I'm used to getting punched. But this one... kinda took me by surprise.
all right, all right, everybody follow me. It's okay.
we just need to close things down for a little while. Keep going. All the all right.
why would somebody shoot the mascot at a kids' play land?
that's like shooting your nana.
your nana dressed up in a giant chicken suit? You know what? Never mind. I don't wanna know.
excuse me, ma'am. Are these your kids? We'll need you to take them outside.
what the hell is going on?
there's been an incident. We need to clear everybody out.
I would love to, believe me. It's my son's 6th birthday party.
we have 18 kids here, eating and puking. And hiding and screaming.
this place is pretty awesome.
I mean... you know, for kids.
Yeah, it's chaos. People started screaming. The kids all took off.
we're still missing two.
what are the boys' names?
Elliot and Nathan. - Good.
they're little jackasses, the both of them. I should never have let them come.
I mean, they don't listen to anybody, not even their own mothers. It's not just me.
okay, look, I'm a dad. I get this.
all right, kids come into a place like this, and their brains turn to cotton candy, right?
I'm sure they're just hiding somewhere. - Okay.
and what I want you to do is take Maria out to the van and wait with the other kids.
okay, we will find the boys.
okay? - Okay. Thank you.
Yes. Okay.
okay, pain-in-the-ass little kids aside, we gotta remember what we're doing here.
we've gotta talk to witnesses, take statements.
okay, see if somebody saw who shot the bird man right in the pecker.
there's video surveillance. It's ancient, but it might have something.
good. Start there. See if there're cameras outside the office.
what about the two kids?
you and me, we'll fan out, okay, see if we can flush them loose.
okay, Peck, you're gonna pull video with Epstein.
actually, sir, if you don't mind, I'd like to help find those boys.
I mean, after all, they are just children, and they are our future.
okay. Whatever. Go. Go. - Okay.
go.
well, it looks to me like our guy came in through the back door by the office, but Janice the manager claims that that door is permanently locked.
Yeah, well, I just spoke to three different people who all said that they saw a red hatchback peal out of the parking lot right after the shots were fired.
getaway car. Good enough for me. Let's get a B. O.L. O. out, sweep the neighborhood, see what we see.
what, you think he's still in the area?
well, remember, most armed robberies happen within ten blocks of the bad guy's house.
they hit places they know. - That's very stupid.
or they haven't heard the expression "don't shoot where you eat.
Yoo-hoo! Children?
we're the police. Get your damn asses out here.
it's hard to believe that didn't work.
what's up with you and Dov?
what?
nothing's up. What do you mean?
I don't know. I mean...
ever since you guys worked the gang case, you've barely spoken to each other.
I mean, you've been weird with each other all week.
Yeah, Dov's weird with everybody. It's genetic.
all right, fine. I'll just ask him.
Chris, it's... it's fine.
well, no, it's not fine. You're his roommate, too. You pay rent. He's not allowed to be a jerk to you.
well, he's not being a jerk. He's just...
he's... don't ask him, okay? He's just feeling a little stupid. It was nothing.
stupid about what?
stupid about taking a bunch of painkillers on the stakeout, saying a bunch of stupid things.
it's not a big deal.
what are you talking about?
it was funny, all right? He said some stuff. He pledged his love. It was ridiculous.
it didn't mean anything.
peck here. We found one of those sticky little sweethearts.
saw an old pal of yours this morning.
who? - Donovan Boyd.
What'd I do wrong this time?
he's setting up a U. C. Operation cover apartment, new identity, whole nine yards.
cover apartment, huh?
this one is off the grid. Only contact is with Boyd and the team.
Yeah, for how long?
weeks, months, maybe longer.
I go in three weeks.
what's it? You're not even gonna think about it?
well, what is there to think about?
looks like Christmas came early.
still warm. - What, you think he ran out of gas?
no. I just think he's your type of guy.
man with a plan.
there's only one camera out back, but it's wide-angle,
so even though he parked in a corner of the lot... We got him.
epstein, that's great. Good work.
so can you do that thingy where you zoom in and you clean up the image?
you know that doesn't actually work, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Here.
best I can do.
Whitish-gray guy, medium build, with a blurry complexion. okay.
Sammy, Sammy. Brother, what's going on?
well, we found the car. He ditched it over on Whitestone.
glove box is empty and the plates are gone.
so no way to I. D him. That's smart.
Yeah, my guess is either he had a partner or a second car. And he made the switch.
great. So we're back to zero.
sir, you should see this.
Sammy, we got a bigger problem.
shooter's got a kid with him.
his name's Elliot walker. 6 years old. He was at a birthday party at Partytown Amusements.
the short answer is, no, we don't have better picture. We're getting one from the school database.
the mother for the child is on her way down here right now.
Elliot was taken at 14:47. That's less than an hour ago.
the bad news is, it's gonna get dark soon. So we gotta work fast.
worse, the bad guy ditched the car, stripped the plates, the V. I.N.
so we do not know who or what we're looking for yet.
detective Barber is running with this. Any help he needs, you give it to him.
mom's here. She knows who took the kid.
it's my ex, Vince. It's Elliot's father.
he's been fighting me for custody for the last year. But he is a drug addict.
God, I don't want him anywhere near my son.
Elliot and I we started again, you know? And I have it all planned out.
I just need a little bit more money. We're moving out east. We're going to my...
any idea where he might take your son?
he was staying at a halfway house in the east end. "Sunrise"?
he wouldn't have taken him there. No, there's no way. Not even Vince is that stupid.
what about family?
all of his family's still in Collingwood, I think.
okay, Tammy, does Vince have a record?
assault, possession.
robbery makes sense now.
Yeah, parental abduction.
and dad's taking off with the kid.
needed cash for the trip.
when the dad's got a record and he's armed, is that enough for an A. M.B. E.R. Alert?
you know, let me get on the horn with, uh, Collingwood P. D. and the O. P.P. to cover the freeways.
I'll get our people to do spot checks on all the other routes out of the city.
very good.
one chicken suit. Returned. Now you know what to wear Saturday night.
afraid we have to keep the head for evidence. Sign here.
it true the same guy that shot me is the one who took the kid?
looks like.
but it's his father, right? So the kid's not in danger or anything?
we hope not, but he does have a history of violence.
and he did shoot you. You remember that, bird boy?
that's the kid's mom over there?
Yeah, that's her.
she's terrified she's never gonna see her son again unless we get a lead.
Traci... This is form b11.
you were supposed to fill out form b14.
B14? Right. - Yeah.
that one is much longer.
I'm sorry, Ricky, but we're gonna have to ask you a few more questions...a lot more.
as far as anyone's concerned, it's a standard seat belt check.
wave them in, get an eyeball on the driver.
we don't know what he's driving, so we gotta check everybody.
all right.
okay, go ahead. Thank you.
so this undercover operation with Boyd I mean, is it dangerous?
well, they don't usually do deep cover on people with parking tickets unless you got a lot of them.
then it's a joint meter maid E. T.F thing. Why? You wanna come with me?
just thought maybe you could use the backup.
I heard last time you were in deep cover. You got chased down and tackled by a girl.
overeager rookie. Didn't want to make her look bad on her first day.
all right, you can go. - Folks, how you doing?
got your seat belt on there? Seat belt?
so what's Frank think about this?
I haven't told him yet.
really is a team player.
what, was I supposed to check with you before I said yes?
you got your 5-, 10-,..20-, 50-year plan. That works for you. I'm the opposite.
opportunity comes along I want it, I take it. Simple as that.
well, congratulations on being so simple.
thank you.
something wrong, officer?
not for you. Have a good day. - Okay, thanks.
okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
it was just supposed to be a sip.
it's water. Water's good for you. I don't drink enough water.
you're not even supposed to have anything to drink.
you're not supposed to have liquids before surgery.
and how long have I... am I gonna be in the hospital for?
I don't know.
banjo. - What?
my stupid cat. If I'm gonna be in the hospital, I need someone to feed him.
okay. You want me to call someone?
my family's all out west.
1754 Boswell. I'm in the annex. There's a cupboard to the right of the fridge. His food's in there.
okay.
careful, okay?
he's kind of a jerk sometimes.
that's okay. I'm used to those.
12 minutes earlier.
I don't want to lose my job.
you're a giant chicken that germy kids punch for fun.
believe me, the fall from grace will not be very far.
if you know anything about Elliot Walker being taken, you have to tell us.
no, I swear, I didn't know that was gonna happen.
but you knew something was gonna happen, right?
look, if you tell us now, we might be able to help you.
otherwise, it looks really bad for you.
this guy came in a few days ago, said his kid was gonna be at a birthday party.
and his ex wouldn't let him talk to him.
I mean, he just wanted to talk to him for a couple of minutes.
he showed me a family photo, so I knew he wasn't a perv.
you think you can just tell everything you need to know by looking at a photo?
what did he need you for?
to leave the back door open so no one would see him coming in.
he paid me 100 bucks.
and then he robbed the office, he shot you. Well, that's sounds like a terrific plan, Ricky.
we weren't supposed to rob anything. I saw a guy in the office.
I thought maybe someone got in because I left the door unlocked.
guess I surprised him.
but you didn't recognize him?
I can't see anything in that damn chicken head.
besides, you guys said he took off in a red hatchback.
dude who came to see me wasn't driving one of those.
what was he driving?
okay.
Bye, sir.
that was Traci. They got a lead on the car.
they think he's driving a maroon S. U.V.
s. U.V.'s one of the most common cars on the road.
don't be a buzzkill. It's a lead.
now you ladies keep an eye out. I'm gonna go see if I can find some bushes need watering.
pretty sure everything's frozen this time of year.
I'm going pee, Diaz.
I'm gonna go pee in the bushes.
do you like Gail?
what?
what happened on the stakeout?
what did she say? - Is it true?
you said you're in love with her.
I don't know. I was totally high.
did you kiss her? - No.
Yes. I...
shut up, man. Don't try and talk this thing down. And laugh like everything's okay.
I thought you two were just finally getting along, with the frozen drinks and the video games.
but it makes sense now.
you were waiting for your opportunity.
no, Chris, I wouldn't do that to - Just shut up, Dov. Just shut the hell up.
s. U.V. fits the description.
1504, we got a maroon S.U.V., avoiding the checkpoint.
he just turned down route 9, headed in your direction.
copy that. Hold you position in case he doubles back. We're on our way.
we can't get more units. The fire on lakeshore's got priority.
they found him. Walker's S. U.V. avoiding a checkpoint, route. They're boxing him in, this is 1504. Route 9, north of exit 56.
it's a car accident. Major damage.
Yeah, I know. I'll check it out. You guys stay here.
1504, shots fired. Repeat, shots fired. Route 9, north of exit 56. Request immediate backup.
what are you guys waiting for? Let's go, let's go.
...all units, 1504 has shots fired. Route 9, north of exit 56. Available units, please respond.
ma'am, you okay? - I'm okay.
Walker's gone.
clipped another car about a hundred yards back, blew his tires, and ditched it here.
he shot at you?
cover fire when we pulled up. Gave himself a head start.
best I can tell, he and the kid went that away toward those woods.
that was less than ten minutes ago. They can't be far.
what about Andy?
she's down the road with a victim in the other car, keeping her stable until medics arrive.
McNally, are you good?
copy. Yeah, everything's under control.
all right, let's go.
should we call E. T. F. wait for backup?
we are backup.
Walker probably just wants to get away with his son, but he might be trying to punish his ex.
you think he could hurt the kid?
it happens.
fresh tracks.
two sets.
they're, uh, they're going in different directions. Maybe they got separated.
maybe. All right, Diaz, Epstein, you go that way. Stay in radio contact.
Yes, sir.
Chris... - Trail splits.
I'm going this way.
1504, rig 16 is five minutes out from your location.
okay, that's the fire department. Okay?
they're gonna get you out of here. It's all right. It's gonna be okay.
come on, Leslie. Just stay with me, all right? Just, like, one more minute.
you're gonna be home soon. And I'm gonna be listening to your songs on the radio.
no, you won't.
I'm a waiterer.
waitress.
a server. Whatever you wanna call it.
really, I mean... You've been writing music and recording demos.
just a couple more months, right?
do you know how long?
not now. I just have to wait until the plan's just right.
"Just... just a couple more songs." Just a couple more tracks.
that bottle of champagne I told you about?
I bought it six years ago.
I mean, what the hell am I saving it for?
later.
you'll drink it later.
right.
no liquids before surgery, right?
come on, stay awake. Okay?
there's no way Walker's getting very far without a vehicle.
another... or 3 miles, these woods meet the highway. He could carjack somebody.
he's already shot one person today.
Epstein. I think I found something.
10-4. We'll be right there.
epstein, what's your location?
you should've left me alone.
epstein, what's your location?
you don't want to do this. - Don't move, walker!
this is not gonna go your way.
put it down! Put the gun down now!
put the gun down.
this is Diaz. We found Walker. We have a 10-33.
shut up! Put the gun down!
he can't do that, not as long as you're pointing your gun at me.
I just wanna be with my son, okay?
I love him. I just want some time alone with him, just the two of us.
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.
put the gun down, or I will shoot you!
Walker, it's over, all right? Just put it down.
Walker! We found Elliot!
daddy! I wanna go home! - Elliot? Are you okay, buddy?
he's fine.
he just didn't wanna play the game anymore.
Vincent, do your son a favor and show him you know how to do the right thing.
put the gun down now and get on your knees!
slowly.
slowly.
down. Down. Give me your hand.
Elliot, I'm sorry! Okay, buddy? Daddy loves you!
you're good. Let's get this kid into the warm.
why does it smell like a camp fire in here?
we can't wait anymore. I gotta get you out of here.
I'm gonna get this underneath you, okay?
so we can make enough room. So you can pull yourself out of there.
Leslie, I'm gonna need your help.
just hold on. Hold on.
I can't breathe. - It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I can't breathe. - Okay, Leslie.
all right. Okay.
when I say "go," you have to pull yourself up no matter how much it hurts, okay?
hold on!
all right, go! Go! Go, go, go!
ready?
just grab grab...
like I said... No problem.
Shaw. - What?
take Elliot. - All right, come here, Elliot.
I'm okay.
I got her out, like, just before it went up.
if I had known the car was gonna catch on fire. It's okay. Even the medic said she's gonna be fine.
you should've radioed.
you were miles out. And, you know, car was on fire. I had that whole thing to deal with.
did you get the boy?
they found him, yeah. - Good.
pretty intense out there, huh?
just glad it worked out.
Chris... I'm sorry.
look, I don't want to talk right now.
and I'm not gonna say everything's okay. Just cause you almost died again.
so it's that last button right there, Elliot.
and look.
isn't that cool? Watch this.
is that amazing?
now if you wanted it to - oh, here we go, little man.
Hey, baby! - Mommy!
sweetheart! Come here! Come here! Baby! Baby!
you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.
you're okay. You wanna go home, baby? - Yes.
yeah? Let's go home, buddy.
all right, let's get you home.
Chris, wait up!
what's wrong? - What's wrong?
you kissed my best friend.
whoa, Chris, it was not even like that.
what you know what? Save it.
because I don't care how high Dov was, I know you, Gail.
and I know there is no way you would let anyone get close enough to do anything unless you wanted them to.
I gotta go.
how's it going?
hell of a day, huh?
Hey, the hospital called.
they need your notes for the postmortem on the woman in the car.
what?
Yeah. Leslie's alive. Seriously, she's fine. I got her out in time. The medic said she'd be fine.
she passed about 30 minutes ago.
she had an embolism. Got into her bloodstream on impact.
hit her lungs, and that was it.
I got her out. I mean, she... She was fine.
I'm sure that you did everything you could.
you couldn't have known. It happens sometimes.
you do what you can, and it looks like you got them, and... Then you don't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I... can you tell Traci I'll catch up with her later?
where you going?
I gotta go feed a jerky cat.
somebody's hungry.
come here.
we all set? Okay.
we did good tonight.
Yeah, we did.
I get it.
I'd do the same if somebody tried to stop me from seeing Leo.
you'd shoot a guy in a chicken suit?
Jerry... Why are you selling your sports car? You love that thing.
I was just thinking it was the right time.
I thought I'd get something, you know, a little more family-friendly, a few more doors, an actual backseat.
see, now that...
that is cool.
yeah?
so it sounds like you had a pretty major night.
well, it's no E. T.F., but yeah.
Gail. Where's, uh, where's Chris?
he's out.
we had a talk, and, uh, and then he left.
I get the feeling she doesn't really like me.
it's not you. It's me.
this is Sam. Leave a message.
look, I just wanted to say that I... I know that I've got a plan, you know?
and it's a great one. But screw it. Okay?
screw the plan, because I don't wanna save the good candy for later anymore, you know?
I wanna drink the champagne now and... Okay, you've got three weeks, right?
so let's make them count, starting tonight.
I'm coming over.
okay, here's your new lifeline.
you remember the drill, yeah?
no contact with anybody except for me and my team from now on.
Yeah, I got it.
okay, I'm gonna send somebody over to your place to take care of it, and you're all set.
sorry for the short notice, but we had to move on this thing tonight.
it's not like I had any big plans.
my character, or the public trust.
oath of honor?
I memorized it as a kid.
I used to make my dad say it to me every morning Before he went to work.
thought it might keep him safe.
he used to say to me, "I'll do my best, kiddo. But I'm only human.
every time.
God, it used to make me so angry.
Andy, it's gonna be okay.
what am I gonna do?
please.
tell me what I'm supposed to do.
what are we singing?
no way, man. I live with you.
I've heard you sing in the shower. Don't bring me down.
you're not gonna sing with me? - No. No.
are you gonna sing with me? - No. I, too, have heard you in the shower.
Gail will sing with you.
no, I don't--I don't-- I don't sing.
Andy. - What?
nonono, no, no. I will never be drunk enough to get up there.
next up, officer nash! Nash!
find me something easy.
I can't hear you.
I'm leaving now.
almost makes me wish I was there.
yeah? What would you sing?
stuck in the middle with you.
stuck in the middle with you. that's nice.
no, no, "love, " uh, "love the one you're with.
yeah? How about "all by myself"?
no, you're not.
you will be.
Thanks. I'm kidding. I wouldn't sinin
I know you wouldn't. You're too cool.
Hey, I do a lot of things, all right?
I cook. I clean. I'm good with tools.
I'm an excellent driver.
you ever wish we w we normal?
what do you mean? We are normrm.
you know what I mean.
Andy, if I could ask you to stay, I would.
then ask me to stay.
just one night.
you know, I'll go home in the morning.
besides, it's freezing outside.
well, it's cold.
Hey, it'd be practically inhuman to make me go back out there.
stay. - Okay.
so. . . you know, I stayed over.
then yesterday, when I'm just about to leave, Jamie brennan shows up.
when did sam disappear?
sometime last night.
I don't know what happened.
McNally, they're ready for you. - Okay.
what if we don't find him? What if it's all my fault?
I like big butts, and I cannot lie - would you stop?
you other - Dude, it's your fault I'm singing it.
I've had it stuck in my head for, like, two days.
so? "baby got back. " I don't regret it.
endless love" duet with you-- that I regret.
Hey, five minutes, parade room.
what's going on?
swarek disappeared last night.
he was working undercover.
he went off the grid. He hasn't called in since.
so? Swarek's a badass.
he's probably wired up somewhere, Playing poker with the bad guys.
that's bad.
Where's andy? - She's in with boyd right now.
okay, one week ago, You bump into swarek on your undercover exercise.
you meet at a bar. You go back to his cover apartment together.
Yes. I was only there a few hours.
what about the other night? - I told you. He called me.
I went over for the second time, and I spent the night.
no, she's a witness.
cop part doesn't matter right now.
. . . two blocks away from his apartment, And then I even walked around the block. . .
anyway, we need it on camera. Sammy shows up dead, We need her statement intact.
I'm sorry, sir.
briefing in five.
I don't even know what to say, mcnally.
this goes so far beyond rookie that I don't even know- - frank, frank, frank, frank.
I wanna talk about yesterday.
I want you to walk me through it again.
jamie brennan showed up, and he wanted to talk to sam.
then what? - He offered me a ride downtown.
he drove me to the marina.
we talked, and then he dropped me off.
what did you talk about? Tell me again.
we talked about football, And we talked about his-- His wife and his daughter gracie.
he said that they'd been in a car accident, but, you know, He wasn't even sure that they were in an accident.
look, I'm. . . what are we doing?
this is--this is pointless.
Why? - Because he made you.
there is a thousand ways he could've done-- I mean, I don't wanna sit here anymore thinking about which way He could've done
look, the fact is he did it!
you got made.
this guy is a pro.
that is why I picked swarek, Because I thought he had a fighting chance.
the thing is, mcnally. . . you didn't.
jamie brennan--48 years old, former enforcer For the north end guys.
now he runs a trucking company in missisiauga.
he did a few years in kingston pen For smuggling, possession for the purpose of trafficking,
but we didn't get him for any of the good stuff.
what's the good stuff?
stuff with power tools, people he tortured, People he killed.
what was s arek doing?
working in brennan's warehouse, making friends.
wanted to see if he was still in the life, Maybe get him on one of those old homicides.
so what happened?
there was a breach.
surveillance video from last night.
so what's happening, man? - Where's, uh, candice?
uh, she's not back yet.
I'm thinking about that, uh, boat of yours.
he didn't have time to call it in Because this was not a scheduled meet.
so no cover team.
. . . couple beers, talk a little business.
unless you're busy--I don't know--watching football or. . .
no, I'm--I'm good. I'm not a big football guy.
so I'll meet you there, man.
no use taking two cars. I'm r rht outside. Right on. Let's go.
that's it? - We don't have cameras outside.
so sam hasn't called in, and brennan's disappeared.
so we treat it as suspicious until we find him.
who's candice?
okay, so guns and gangs have got people at brennan's home And his warehouse.
nothing's come up yet.
so in the meantime, we get to work on brennan.
I don't think I need to tell anybody how urgent this is.
let's go.
Jerry, who's candice?
the breach.
dude.
it's mcnally, all right?
she's been seeing sam while he's undercover.
we're canvassing brennan's immediate neighbors.
nothing fancy.
anybody seen him, no big deal, okay?
you will handle this l l-key, understood?
peck, I want you going through brennan's case files. - Excuse me.
sorry to bother you. - See if there's any old addresses, Anyplace brennan might be.
do you know what? I can just wait.
what? Hi. Uh, pete sun.
officer pete sun.
I'm, uh, here for my orientation n y.
Oh, man.
Oh, come on, oliver.
all right, look, I forgot. Whatever.
uh, epstein, diaz, handle it.
parade room, locker room, hand sanitizer, hallway.
okay, fill me in. What's the plan?
we're canvassing, talking to brennan's neighbors.
what? - Is she okay?
I'm fine. Who are you?
new recruit.
great. Welcome to 15.
what else did jerry say?
you hear any gossip today, forget it.
Why? What would I hear?
her t. O. Was undercover. Turns out they were secretly, you know.
wow, that's a blatant violation of protocol.
shut up.
old pictures of cops, interrogation room, Bulletin board.
good.
I was starting to worry.
hold still.
Maggie never liked these much.
white sheets-- That's all she'd ever buy.
said it made her life feel clean.
it's amazing what you do for someone you love.
get rid of your sheets. . . car. . . your past.
I would have done anything for her.
I still would.
Hi. This is officer diaz from 15 division.
is this mr. Lanyon?
Mr. Lanyon, hi.
I'm just calling to check If you've seen one of your neighbors in the last 24 hours-- A man by the name of jamie brennan.
what happened? - He hung up.
who hangs up on the police? - A lot of people, actually.
but it's so rude. - It's disrespectful.
serve, protect, and, uh, get used to it.
Hi, mr. Lanyon.
Hi. This is officer diaz from 15 division, And if you hang up on me again, I can promise you,
I'll take a great deal of pleasure In coming down to your house and questioning you in person.
that's what I thought.
we were driving around, You know, talking about football.
maybe that's where I screwed up.
you know, I just kept going on About whatever's oliver's talking about.
then we ended up in the marina.
why would he take you there?
I thought he was gonna kill me.
then he got all quiet and he started talking about his wife,
his daughter, and how they were in a car accident and died.
Yeah, but he was talking about how his
his past came back, And, you know, that he wasn't always a nice guy, which
Yeah, but for someone who tortures people with pliers, He's been very nice these last four years.
he doesn't even have a parking ticket.
so what changed? Why take somebody hostage now?
I don't know.
when did his wife die? - Two months ago.
all right, so let's take a look at the accident. Maybe there's something there.
it's an accident report.
two fatalities-- A mother and her 4-year-old daughter.
Brennan's wife and daughter.
doesn't make me like him any better.
that--that's not what we're asking.
okay, then what are you asking? Please enlighten me.
what is his wife dying in an accident have to do With the fact that we're missing one of our officers?
there are whole sections in here that aren't filled out.
there's no statements, no witnesses, No reconstruction report.
Okh sloppy paperwork. It happens.
it's not sloppy. It's incomplete. There's nothing here.
then you know what? Talk to the officer who filed it.
look, "g. Armstrong. " probably still works in 34. Or don't.
obviously, I wanna find him, luke. - I'll bet.
what are you doing here?
I'm coordinating with 27.
we put out a b. O. L. O. On brennan's car.
no sign of him yet, but we've got every squad in the city Keeping an eye out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what-- what are you doing. . . here?
I'm here to help.
Yeah, but I thought today Was the d d you were gonna start your, um. . . take some personal time.
not now. Not with this.
I'm all right. I just need to be here.
Yeah, but. . . this is officer williams.
Yeah.
four whole squad cars?
busy, busy, busy.
don't be such a snot.
why not? It works for me.
G. Armstrong?
thank you.
officer armstrong? - Yeah.
Hi. Andy mcnally. - Giselle.
Hi. Gail peck. - Nice to meet you.
um. . . I expected you to be in uniform.
I just made detective.
Oh, congratulations.
Yeah. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of those pants.
it's a tough look to pull off.
although you two seem to make it work.
what can I do for you? Okay.
is that you? - Yeah.
is there anything you could tell us?
I can tell you this case is closed.
the woman who was killed-- We're trying to track down her husband.
so you pulled up her a. That seems a little weird.
no, actually, what's weird is, um. . . this. . . this. . . d, oh, that.
is she always this abrasive?
we just have a few questions about the report. - You know what? I am, actually. I'd love to know what it takes to make detective around here,
because damn, I think I should transfer, 'cause this is some seriously sloppy paperwork.
you guys feel like a coffee?
latte? Cappuccino? We just got this new machine.
it's really cute. It uses these little pods.
those things can really dry out your mouth.
where the hell is candice?
dropped her off downtown.
what are you doing?
just looking for some answers.
answers for what?
questions that I have.
and what makes you think I got answers? - "god's good grace.
my boat?
Jamie, I'm sorry for doing business out of your warehouse Without your permission.
that's funny. That's good.
look, I've been out of the life for a while.
but you know back in the day, There was this, uh, guy wayne somethin' from out east.
used to run heroin up the coast.
he got pinched last year with a full load, So now he's doing 15 in dorchester.
everything hehead is now property of the police, Ininuding his boat-t- "god's good grace.
and I guess it still is. Right?
officer?
so what am I doing here?
I wanna know what happened to my family.
I wanna know what happened to my family. . .
and why that accident report was faked.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, you don't.
someone killed my family, And the police covered it up.
you're gonna tell me who.
Jamie, listen to me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, okay. Good.
funny thing is, You think you can hold your breath.
a little gets down the throat. . .
nose, your brain's hardwired to think that it's drowning.
lungs contract, heart contracts.
and, well, that happens.
is this how things work in 15?
you storm in all righteous and entitled, Demanding things from your superiors?
we just wanna know what happened.
down here, you're in uniform, detective gives you an order, You take it.
you do it.
greater good, there's gotta be a reason.
Yeah, reason being so you could make detective.
I did everything right.
Yeah, accident looked weird to me.
it didn't add up.
I found two eyewitnesses Who saw some guy nosing around the car in the driveway Before it crashed.
even got the guy's license plate number.
reconstruction guys came in, our best mechanic-- It was all in the report.
then. . . some detective showed up, Handed it back to me. It was scrubbed.
no notes. Different mechanic. Told me to sign off.
what, that doesn't bother you?
where are you going?
I'm tired of listening to your sermon.
what, so you're just gonna walk away?
no. I'm gonna give you a copy of my notes.
I kept 'em. I knew this was gonna come back to me.
I have everything-- the names of the witnesses, License plate number, the guy they saw by the car.
name of the mechanic who ended up signing off.
Yeah, what abououthe name of the detective--- The one that made it go away?
look, there is a huge difference Between knowing your place and covering up a homicide.
he's not from this division. He works out of guns and gangs. 3
guy's name is boyd. Detective donovan boyd.
all right, at do we do? - I don't know. I'm thinking.
you know, we gotta call frank or jerry.
No! No, they're working with him right now. We might as well call bbd himself.
what do we know?
okay, we know two witnesses saw a guy near the car Right before it crashed. - Okay.
she said she got a plate. - Okay.
find out. We'll run it.
maybe we can find out who messed with the car.
thth woman has terrible handwriting.
I don't know what it is with lesbians, But they all have terrible handwriting, And they're always hitting on me.
what are you talkininabout? - Doesn't bother me.
she's only human, andy, And she was kinda cute- - this has nothing to do with anything!
what is the license plate number? - I'm looking for it.
okay, well, this is the mechanic who signed off on the report.
paul kaminski. Says he's right downtown.
okay, let's get the boys to check it out.
what are we gonna tell them? - E're gonna tell 'em the truth.
nothing in the warehouse, and nobody cares? And then what?
the boss doesn't show, nobody notices?
it's. . . Yeah, well, figure it out, 'cause we got a cop.
he's out there, and he's been made. Clock is ticking.
Hey, where is everybody? - I don't know.
they're supposed to be on the phones, Canvassing the neighbors.
I'm sure they are.
what is that? What are you looking at?
swarek's undercover file.
this is confidential.
detective barber gave it to me.
you checked the boat, right? "god's good grace"? It was part of swarek's cover story.
who's this guy?
new guy. Orientation.
Hey. What are you doing?
watching and learning, sir.
yeah? Where did they go?
the. . . Deckstein, pez, whatever.
I don't know, sir.
I asked you a question.
honestly, sir, they, uh, wouldn't tell me.
but I could take your lunch order.
look, we just wanna touch base, you know? There have been some questions.
we just wanna make sure We have the right answers.
Boyd wants us up to speed.
so ask him.
we're the ones who have to talk to the family. They're coming in, threatening to sue.
accident report's a bit of a fairy tale, So what the hell are we supposed to tell 'em?
tell 'em the truth. It's all right there.
Oh, electrical system failed. Brakes, steering, everything.
gas line was damaged.
car hit a tree, And it went up.
did anybody tamper with the car? You know, that's what they're asking.
car's gone. All right?
you stand by that report, I will, too.
Boyd's done right by me.
just tell him not to worry so much.
license plate number's registered to a shawn elmore At this address.
you sure this is the right address?
it's 1663 eastern. I mean, and that's his car.
Yeah, no, I recognize the place. It's a clubhouse.
which gang? - J. M. C.
I mean, it's a small chapter.
you know what? I'm calling frank.
no, no, no, no. You know who we need to call? Luke.
okay, give me the highlights.
accident report's bogus.
the mechanic basically admitted the car had been tampered with.
Yeah, we went to the see the officer who filed the report Up at 34 division, just like you said. - Okay.
well, she filed it, and they scrubbed it clean. They gave it back to her to sign.
Why? - She didn't know.
said we should talk to the detective Who gave the orders.
okay, then, who gave the orderss - Donovan boyd.
who else have you told? - No one. Just you.
we ran the plates from the original report. We found the guy. He's a biker. His name is shawn elmore.
burgers or pho? - Not now!
okay, elmore's j. M. C. A new patch, so sorry, sir, it's just that I know you're working really hard On this case, and I'd hate for the food to get cold Before you had a chance to. . .
chopsticks are. . . in the bag.
so boyd has been making some serious headway into the bikers.
the guys in gangs call him "Kreskin.
who's Kreskin? - He knows where. He knows when. He knows who.
before it's even happening, he knows what's happened.
so he's got an informant.
Yeah, well, he says no. He hasn't carded the guy.
there's no statements, so if he does, the guy's a ghost.
okay, so why would a biker wanna kill brennan's wife and child?
this dead guy here is matthew elmore, Shawn's brother, okay?
he had a beef with brennan probably over some turf.
so why hit him back now?
cause retaliation's harder than you think, Especially when you're dealing with a pro like brennan. You don't wanna get caught.
all right, what do we do? - I don't know.
you just stood up. I thought that meant you knew what to do.
let's talk to him. Let's bring him in.
on what charge? - Uh, how about the murder Of maggie and grace brennan to start?
peck, come on. - All right.
you're staying. There's already a big enough mess. I'm not gonna make it worse.
look, nothing personal.
I know you're just doing your job, but come on.
whatever you're making in overtime, It's not worth it.
somebody rigged my car.
just give me a name.
I know it's hard to accept when accidents like that happen.
Hey, wasn't an accident. I know the difference. It didn't just happen.
'cause you're working me!You're working undercover. You have access to everything about me.
that report is the only thing I ever saw.
if it was anything else, I don't know about it.
so you're trying to tell me you're deep undercover, And your handler gave you the same $12 report as I saw?
same guy who gave me a boat seized in a high-profile drug raid.
believe me, he's not my favorite person right now.
or maybe you're just a good cop, 'cause you know I'm gonna kill whoever you give up.
so you're just gonna hold on to that name as long as you can.
I don't know who killed your family.
refill?
let's go.
Shawn elmore? - What can I do for ya?
wanna talk to you about jamie brennan. - Sorry.
uh, I don't know who that is. - Really?
funny, considering you murdered his wife and daughter.
you know, some new information's come up, and it seems the deal you made With donovan boyd is about to expire.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
okay, I guess, uh, we can just talk to your boys back there, see if they know how you got away with it for so long.
Oh, and how the guns and gangs unit seems to know so damn much about what you've been doing the last little while.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
you give him an incomplete case file, and then you don't tell him the truth.
Brennan's family didn't die in an accident. They were murdered.
you're covering for an informant-- Shawn elmore, a biker. He tampers with brennan's car, and you cover it up for him.
now you own him, which is working out great for you, isn't it?
you come up with this theory? 'cause I think it's amazing.
Yeah, well, it works for me.
God, you are noble.
I mean, your girlfriend screws up, Jumps into the sack with another officer.
she's not my girlfriend. - Oops, sorry.
fiance.
she's a rookie, and right now she's taking the fall for you.
well, I think under these circumstances, You're talking out of your ass.
I hope you're worth it.
why isn't the wi-fi working? - It's been all day.
it's fine. I'm tethering to my phone.
I could have done that. What's going on?
we got the why. " trying to figure out the "where"-- Where would brennan take sam?
okay, so I'm brennan.
I'm thinking maybe you have Some information about my wife, so I take you where?
to, uh, to a motel or, uh, to my boathouse or to my cabin.
according to this, Brennan doesn't own any properties besides his home.
all right, fine. So I take you to my--my mom's cabin or my girlfriend's cabin.
you have a girlfriend? - No, I don't have a girlfriend.
what. . . wait. Wh-what was his wife's name?
Maggie. Maggie brennan, I guess.
uh, what's her maiden name? - I don't know.
there's one property Listed under that name.
it's in pickering. 27 acres on century road.
I can't tell from this if there's a house on it.
I can. There is.
we've got a lead. 27 acres just north of the city.
property was listed under the wife's maiden name.
go. Thank you.
if they go alone, they're gonna screw it up.
if you go alone, you'll screw it up.
you stand for something. You stand for somethin'. I respect that.
if you tell me who did it, He's gonna be the next person in n at chair.
and you're a cop. It's your job to protect people.
I had a job, too.
it was to take care of my wife and child.
this one's my favorite.
I took this right after gracie said her first word.
Maggie couldn't believe it.
just kept getting her to say it over and over again.
Elda, Elda, Elda, Elda
tiny, perfect little girl. . . saying a word.
and I felt like no matter who I was before that moment, I was her father.
I was good at it. They're both innocent.
now they're dead.
whoever did this didn't deserve your protection.
Jamie, I don't know who it was.
no matter what you do to me, That's not gonna change.
dog's name was zelda.
that was her first word.
I hope that's not your gun hand.
second word. . . "ottle. " "bottle. " wasn't great at consonants.
third word. . . - O-okay. Okay. Okay.
you think someone murdered your family. You think the police covered it up.
maybe.
you're gonna kill me anyway, So before that happens, let's get really clear About who the bad guy is here.
you hurt a lot of people.
if somebody messed with your life, You got no one to blame but yourself.
I'm not gonna kill you any faster if you piss me off.
let me help you narrow it down.
Vincent decarlo-- Family couldn't even I. D. The body.
Matthew elmore--biker. So is his brother.
those guys never forget.
Nora wilsoso-she's the one I was hoping to get you for.
security guard, single mother, three little kids-- You shot her in the head.
your wife and daughter didn't deserve what happened to 'em,
but it was only a matter of time because you didn't deserve them.
you think you've changed. You haven't changed. Look at you.
I didn't wanna have to do this - I didn't see a car. - Yeah. Maybe they're in there.
Noellll, are you ready to search the house? We'll start there, then we'll hit the barn.
we're ready. Durham guys are on the way.
you want to wait? - Hell, no.
good. Epstein, diaz, we're gonna take the front door.
Nash, you're with noelle. You slide around back.
wait for my count.
you're not coming.
Oliver. - Mcnally, you're not coming.
whoa, cadet, you stay here. You holster that weapon.
don't slam it.

Oliver's gonna count it off. on three. . . two. . . one. - Three. . . two. . . one.
they're going at the same time-- Both doors, front and back.
if it's dark inside, then you gotta use youuflashlight.
flashlight, gun out. It's tricky.
make sure you stay controlled. It's really hard to do.
your adrenaline is going.
what you wanna do is run in there and fix everything.
you can't do it like that.
keep it slow, No matter what might be happening.
shut up. Shut up.
keep going throughout the house and clear every single room.
go.
move up the stairs. . . which is a lot harder than you think.
you better stay together. You're exposed.
you don't know what you're gonna find.
you don't even know what you're gonna do when you get there.
see, that's the thing. It's different every time.
so you better trust your instincts.
you try to stay alive. Try to keep others alive.
what happens if you're too late?
well, at least you know you did everything right.
let him go, brennan! Let him go!
you stay down!
1519. Put a rush on the medics. We got an officer injured. One in custody.

because, look, you and that rookie- - Her name is officer mcnally.
and two years on the job, She's alalady ten times the cop you'll ever be.

two months ago, a mother and child were killed, Murdered in a. . . car.
and you guys still don't seem that interested.
I find that frustrating.
we have someone in custody. - Who?
I can't tell you that.
but I can tell you that the case is officially reopened.
okay.
I'll wait for the lawyer, then we'll get started.
tell your guy, uh, no hard feelings.
he's a stand-up guy.
Sam. - Boss.

Nope.

how are we gonna do that?
I don't know. I have no idea.
we've all got to be going somewhere
my character, or the public trust.
oath of honor?
I memorized it as a kid.
I used to make my dad say it to me every morning Before he went to work.
thought it might keep him safe.
he used to say to me,"I'll do my best, kiddo. But I'm only human.
every time.
God, it used to make me so angry.
Andy, it's gonna be okay.
what am I gonna do?
please.
tell me what I'm supposed to do.
what are we singing?
no way, man. I live with you.
I've heard you sing in the shower. Don't bring me down.

I cook. I clean. I'm good with tools.
I'm an excellent driver.
you ever wish we w we normal?
what do you mean? We are normrm.
you know what I mean.
Andy, if I could ask you to stay, I would.
then ask me to stay.
just one night.
you know, I'll go home in the morning.
besides, it's freezing outside.
well, it's cold.
Hey, it'd be practically inhuman to make me go back out there.
stay. - Okay.
so... You know, I stayed over.
then yesterday, when I'm just about to leave, Jamie brennan shows up.
when did sam disappear?
sometime last night.
I don't know what happened.
McNally, they're ready for you. - Okay.
what if we don't find him? What if it's all my fault?
I like big butts, and I cannot lie - would you stop?
you other - Dude, it's your fault I'm singing it.
I've had it stuck in my head for, like, two days.
So?"baby got back." I don't regret it.
endless love" duet with you-- that I regret.
Hey, five minutes, parade room.
what's going on?
swarek disappeared last night.
he was working undercover.
he went off the grid. He hasn't called in since.
so? Swarek's a badass.
he's probably wired up somewhere, Playing poker with the bad guys.
that's bad.
Where's andy? - She's in with boyd right now.
okay, one week ago, You bump into swarek on your undercover exercise.
you meet at a bar. You go back to his cover apartment together.
Yes. I was only there a few hours.
what about the other night? - I told you. He called me.
I went over for the second time, and I spent the night.
no, she's a witness.
cop part doesn't matter right now.
...Two blocks away from his apartment, And then I even walked around the block...
anyway, we need it on camera. Sammy shows up dead, We need her statement intact.
I'm sorry, sir.
briefing in five.
I don't even know what to say, mcnally.
this goes so far beyond rookie that I don't even know- - frank, frank, frank, frank.
I wanna talk about yesterday.
I want you to walk me through it again.
jamie brennan showed up, and he wanted to talk to sam.
then what? - He offered me a ride downtown.
he drove me to the marina.
we talked, and then he dropped me off.
what did you talk about? Tell me again.
we talked about football, And we talked about his-- His wife and his daughter gracie.
he said that they'd been in a car accident, but, you know, He wasn't even sure that they were in an accident.
look, I'm... What are we doing?
this is--this is pointless.
Why? - Because he made you.
there is a thousand ways he could've done-- I mean, I don't wanna sit here anymore thinking about which way He could've done
look, the fact is he did it!
you got made.
this guy is a pro.
that is why I picked swarek, Because I thought he had a fighting chance.
the thing is, mcnally... You didn't.
jamie brennan--48 years old, former enforcer For the north end guys.
now he runs a trucking company in missisiauga.
he did a few years in kingston pen For smuggling, possession for the purpose of trafficking,
but we didn't get him for any of the good stuff.
what's the good stuff?
stuff with power tools, people he tortured, People he killed.
what was s arek doing?
working in brennan's warehouse, making friends.
wanted to see if he was still in the life, Maybe get him on one of those old homicides.
so what happened?
there was a breach.
surveillance video from last night.
so what's happening, man? - Where's, uh, candice?
uh, she's not back yet.
I'm thinking about that, uh, boat of yours.
he didn't have time to call it in Because this was not a scheduled meet.
so no cover team.
...Couple beers, talk a little business.
unless you're busy--I don't know--watching football or...
no, I'm--I'm good. I'm not a big football guy.
so I'll meet you there, man.
no use taking two cars. I'm r rht outside. Right on. Let's go.
that's it? - We don't have cameras outside.
so sam hasn't called in, and brennan's disappeared.
so we treat it as suspicious until we find him.
who's candice?
okay, so guns and gangs have got people at brennan's home And his warehouse.
nothing's come up yet.
so in the meantime, we get to work on brennan.
I don't think I need to tell anybody how urgent this is.
let's go.
Jerry, who's candice?
the breach.
dude.
it's mcnally, all right?
she's been seeing sam while he's undercover.
we're canvassing brennan's immediate neighbors.
nothing fancy.
anybody seen him, no big deal, okay?
you will handle this l l-key, understood?
peck, I want you going through brennan's case files. - Excuse me.
sorry to bother you. - See if there's any old addresses, Anyplace brennan might be.
do you know what? I can just wait.

what else did jerry say?
you hear any gossip today, forget it.
Why? What would I hear?
her t. O.Was undercover. Turns out they were secretly, you know.
wow, that's a blatant violation of protocol.
shut up.
old pictures of cops, interrogation room, Bulletin board.
good.
I was starting to worry.
hold still.
Maggie never liked these much.
white sheets-- That's all she'd ever buy.
said it made her life feel clean.
it's amazing what you do for someone you love.
get rid of your sheets... Car... Your past.
I would have done anything for her.
I still would.
Hi. This is officer diaz from 15 division.
is this mr. Lanyon?
Mr. Lanyon, hi.
I'm just calling to check If you've seen one of your neighbors in the last 24 hours-- A man by the name of jamie brennan.
what happened? - He hung up.
who hangs up on the police? - A lot of people, actually.
but it's so rude. - It's disrespectful.
serve, protect, and, uh, get used to it.
Hi, mr. Lanyon.
Hi. This is officer diaz from 15 division, And if you hang up on me again, I can promise you,
I'll take a great deal of pleasure In coming down to your house and questioning you in person.
that's what I thought.
we were driving around, You know, talking about football.
maybe that's where I screwed up.
you know, I just kept going on About whatever's oliver's talking about.
then we ended up in the marina.
why would he take you there?
I thought he was gonna kill me.
then he got all quiet and he started talking about his wife,
his daughter, and how they were in a car accident and died.
Yeah, but he was talking about how his
his past came back, And, you know, that he wasn't always a nice guy, which
Yeah, but for someone who tortures people with pliers, He's been very nice these last four years.
he doesn't even have a parking ticket.
so what changed? Why take somebody hostage now?
I don't know.
when did his wife die? - Two months ago.
all right, so let's take a look at the accident. Maybe there's something there.
it's an accident report.
two fatalities-- A mother and her 4-year-old daughter.
Brennan's wife and daughter.
doesn't make me like him any better.
that--that's not what we're asking.
okay, then what are you asking? Please enlighten me.
what is his wife dying in an accident have to do With the fact that we're missing one of our officers?
there are whole sections in here that aren't filled out.
there's no statements, no witnesses, No reconstruction report.
Okh sloppy paperwork. It happens.
it's not sloppy. It's incomplete. There's nothing here.
then you know what? Talk to the officer who filed it.
Look,"g. Armstrong." probably still works in 34. Or don't.
obviously, I wanna find him, luke. - I'll bet.
what are you doing here?
I'm coordinating with 27.
we put out a b. O.L. O. On brennan's car.
no sign of him yet, but we've got every squad in the city Keeping an eye out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what-- what are you doing... Here?
I'm here to help.
Yeah, but I thought today Was the d d you were gonna start your, um... Take some personal time.

I'm all right. I just need to be here.
Yeah, but... this is officer williams.
Yeah.
four whole squad cars?

why not? It works for me.
G. Armstrong?
thank you.
officer armstrong? - Yeah.
Hi. Andy mcnally. - Giselle.
Hi. Gail peck. - Nice to meet you.
um... I expected you to be in uniform.
I just made detective.
Oh, congratulations.
Yeah. I couldn't wait to get the hell out of those pants.
it's a tough look to pull off.
although you two seem to make it work.
what can I do for you? Okay.
is that you? - Yeah.
is there anything you could tell us?
I can tell you this case is closed.
the woman who was killed-- We're trying to track down her husband.
so you pulled up her a. That seems a little weird.
no, actually, what's weird is, um... This... This... D, oh, that.
is she always this abrasive?
we just have a few questions about the report. - You know what? I am, actually. I'd love to know what it takes to make detective around here,
because damn, I think I should transfer,'cause this is some seriously sloppy paperwork.
you guys feel like a coffee?
latte? Cappuccino? We just got this new machine.
it's really cute. It uses these little pods.
those things can really dry out your mouth.
where the hell is candice?
dropped her off downtown.
what are you doing?
just looking for some answers.
answers for what?
questions that I have.
and what makes you think I got answers? - "god's good grace.
my boat?
Jamie, I'm sorry for doing business out of your warehouse Without your permission.
that's funny. That's good.
look, I've been out of the life for a while.
but you know back in the day, There was this, uh, guy wayne somethin' from out east.
used to run heroin up the coast.
he got pinched last year with a full load, So now he's doing 15 in dorchester.
everything hehead is now property of the police, Ininuding his boat-t- "god's good grace.
and I guess it still is. Right?
officer?
so what am I doing here?
I wanna know what happened to my family.
I wanna know what happened to my family...
and why that accident report was faked.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Oh, you don't.
someone killed my family, And the police covered it up.
you're gonna tell me who.
Jamie, listen to me.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Yeah, okay. Good.
funny thing is, You think you can hold your breath.
a little gets down the throat...
nose, your brain's hardwired to think that it's drowning.
lungs contract, heart contracts.
and, well, that happens.
is this how things work in 15?
you storm in all righteous and entitled, Demanding things from your superiors?
we just wanna know what happened.
down here, you're in uniform, detective gives you an order, You take it.
you do it.
greater good, there's gotta be a reason.
Yeah, reason being so you could make detective.
I did everything right.
Yeah, accident looked weird to me.
it didn't add up.
I found two eyewitnesses Who saw some guy nosing around the car in the driveway Before it crashed.
even got the guy's license plate number.
reconstruction guys came in, our best mechanic-- It was all in the report.
then... Some detective showed up, Handed it back to me. It was scrubbed.
no notes. Different mechanic. Told me to sign off.
what, that doesn't bother you?
where are you going?
I'm tired of listening to your sermon.
what, so you're just gonna walk away?
no. I'm gonna give you a copy of my notes.
I kept 'em. I knew this was gonna come back to me.
I have everything-- the names of the witnesses, License plate number, the guy they saw by the car.
name of the mechanic who ended up signing off.
Yeah, what abououthe name of the detective--- The one that made it go away?
look, there is a huge difference Between knowing your place and covering up a homicide.
he's not from this division. He works out of guns and gangs. 3
guy's name is boyd. Detective donovan boyd.
all right, at do we do? - I don't know. I'm thinking.
you know, we gotta call frank or jerry.
No! No, they're working with him right now. We might as well call bbd himself.
what do we know?
okay, we know two witnesses saw a guy near the car Right before it crashed. - Okay.
she said she got a plate. - Okay.
find out. We'll run it.
maybe we can find out who messed with the car.
thth woman has terrible handwriting.
I don't know what it is with lesbians, But they all have terrible handwriting, And they're always hitting on me.
what are you talkininabout? - Doesn't bother me.
she's only human, andy, And she was kinda cute- - this has nothing to do with anything!
what is the license plate number? - I'm looking for it.
okay, well, this is the mechanic who signed off on the report.
paul kaminski. Says he's right downtown.
okay, let's get the boys to check it out.
what are we gonna tell them? - E're gonna tell 'em the truth.
nothing in the warehouse, and nobody cares? And then what?
the boss doesn't show, nobody notices?
it's... Yeah, well, figure it out,'cause we got a cop.
he's out there, and he's been made. Clock is ticking.
Hey, where is everybody? - I don't know.
they're supposed to be on the phones, Canvassing the neighbors.
I'm sure they are.
what is that? What are you looking at?
swarek's undercover file.
this is confidential.
detective barber gave it to me.
you checked the boat, right?"god's good grace"? It was part of swarek's cover story.
who's this guy?
new guy. Orientation.
Hey. What are you doing?
watching and learning, sir.
yeah? Where did they go?
the... Deckstein, pez, whatever.
I don't know, sir.
I asked you a question.
honestly, sir, they, uh, wouldn't tell me.
but I could take your lunch order.
look, we just wanna touch base, you know? There have been some questions.
we just wanna make sure We have the right answers.
Boyd wants us up to speed.
so ask him.
we're the ones who have to talk to the family. They're coming in, threatening to sue.
accident report's a bit of a fairy tale, So what the hell are we supposed to tell 'em?
tell 'em the truth. It's all right there.
Oh, electrical system failed. Brakes, steering, everything.
gas line was damaged.
car hit a tree, And it went up.
did anybody tamper with the car? You know, that's what they're asking.
car's gone. All right?
you stand by that report, I will, too.
Boyd's done right by me.
just tell him not to worry so much.
license plate number's registered to a shawn elmore At this address.
you sure this is the right address?
it's 1663 eastern. I mean, and that's his car.
Yeah, no, I recognize the place. It's a clubhouse.
which gang? - J. M.C.
I mean, it's a small chapter.
you know what? I'm calling frank.
no, no, no, no. You know who we need to call? Luke.
okay, give me the highlights.
accident report's bogus.
the mechanic basically admitted the car had been tampered with.
Yeah, we went to the see the officer who filed the report Up at 34 division, just like you said. - Okay.
well, she filed it, and they scrubbed it clean. They gave it back to her to sign.
Why? - She didn't know.
said we should talk to the detective Who gave the orders.
okay, then, who gave the orderss - Donovan boyd.
who else have you told? - No one. Just you.
we ran the plates from the original report. We found the guy. He's a biker. His name is shawn elmore.
burgers or pho? - Not now!
okay, elmore's j. M.C. A new patch, so sorry, sir, it's just that I know you're working really hard On this case, and I'd hate for the food to get cold Before you had a chance to...
chopsticks are... In the bag.
so boyd has been making some serious headway into the bikers.
the guys in gangs call him "kreskin.
who's kreskin? - He knows where. He knows when. He knows who.
okay, so I'm brennan.
I'm thinking maybe you have Some information about my wife, so I take you where?
to, uh, to a motel or, uh, to my boathouse or to my cabin.
according to this, Brennan doesn't own any properties besides his home.
all right, fine. So I take you to my--my mom's cabin or my girlfriend's cabin.
you have a girlfriend? - No, I don't have a girlfriend.
what... Wait. Wh-what was his wife's name?
Maggie. Maggie brennan, I guess.
uh, what's her maiden name? - I don't know.
there's one property Listed under that name.
it's in pickering. 27 acres on century road.
I can't tell from this if there's a house on it.
I can. There is.
we've got a lead. 27 acres just north of the city.
property was listed under the wife's maiden name.
go. Thank you.
if they go alone, they're gonna screw it up.
if you go alone, you'll screw it up.
you stand for something. You stand for somethin'. I respect that.
if you tell me who did it, He's gonna be the next person in n at chair.
and you're a cop. It's your job to protect people.
I had a job, too.
it was to take care of my wife and child.
this one's my favorite.
I took this right after gracie said her first word.
Maggie couldn't believe it.
just kept getting her to say it over and over again.
elda." "elda, elda, elda.
tiny, perfect little girl... Saying a word.
and I felt like no matter who I was before that moment, I was her father.
I was good at it. They're both innocent.
now they're dead.
whoever did this didn't deserve your protection.
Jamie, I don't know who it was.
no matter what you do to me, That's not gonna change.
dog's name was zelda.
that was her first word.
I hope that's not your gun hand.
second word... "ottle." "bottle." wasn't great at consonants.
third word... - O-okay. Okay. Okay.
you think someone murdered your family. You think the police covered it up.
maybe.
you're gonna kill me anyway, So before that happens, let's get really clear About who the bad guy is here.
you hurt a lot of people.
if somebody messed with your life, You got no one to blame but yourself.
I'm not gonna kill you any faster if you piss me off.
let me help you narrow it down.
Vincent decarlo-- Family couldn't even I. D.The body.
Matthew elmore--biker. So is his brother.
those guys never forget.
Nora wilsoso-she's the one I was hoping to get you for.
security guard, single mother, three little kids-- You shot her in the head.
your wife and daughter didn't deserve what happened to 'em,
but it was only a matter of time because you didn't deserve them.
you think you've changed. You haven't changed. Look at you.
I didn't wanna have to do this - I didn't see a car. - Yeah. Maybe they're in there.
Noellll, are you ready to search the house? We'll start there, then we'll hit the barn.
we're ready. Durham guys are on the way.
you want to wait? - Hell, no.

what?? - Listen.
Oliver's gonna count it off. on three... Two... One. - Three... Two... One.
they're going at the same time-- Both doors, front and back.
if it's dark inside, then you gotta use youuflashlight.
flashlight, gun out. It's tricky.
make sure you stay controlled. It's really hard to do.
your adrenaline is going.
what you wanna do is run in there and fix everything.
you can't do it like that.
keep it slow, No matter what might be happening.
shut up. Shut up.
keep going throughout the house and clear every single room.
go.
move up the stairs... Which is a lot harder than you think.
you better stay together. You're exposed.
you don't know what you're gonna find.
you don't even know what you're gonna do when you get there.
see, that's the thing. It's different every time.
so you better trust your instincts.
you try to stay alive. Try to keep others alive.
what happens if you're too late?
well, at least you know you did everything right.
let him go, brennan! Let him go!
you stay down!
1519. Put a rush on the medics. We got an officer injured. One in custody.

and two years on the job, She's alalady ten times the cop you'll ever be.
you're done.
Sammy, come
I'd be happy to talk... If, uh, you tell me what you're gonna do about it first.
do about what?
two months ago, a mother and child were killed, Murdered in a... Car.
and you guys still don't seem that interested.
I find that frustrating.
we have someone in custody. - Who?
I can't tell you that.
but I can tell you that the case is officially reopened.
okay.
I'll wait for the lawyer, then we'll get started.
tell your guy, uh, no hard feelings.
he's a stand-up guy.
Sam. - Boss.
glad we found you. - Me, too.
come on, frank. It's me. - I know. That's the problem.
noelle, are you coming to t t penny? - Yeah. Maybe I might ss you there.
Hey, homicide. You coming or what?
Yeah, uh, I wasn't planning on it, no.
well, I need a ride, so I will meet you out front.
you're still here. - Yep.
how you doing? - I've had better nights.
Yep.
are you heading over to the black penny? I can meet you there.
pick you up when I'm done.
no, I don't think so.
I mean, it's not like I can drink, anyway, so...
why not? What do you mean?
Pr-pregnant? Wh--you were supposed to start your I. V.F. Today. You didn't start that yet.
Nope.
I got soldiers.
Hey. What happened?
got suspended.
you?
I got yelled at, and then I got suspended.
you wanna try being normal together?
how are we gonna do that?
I don't know. I have no idea.
we've all got to be going somewhere
Yeah, the kids are really excited.
Zoe's gonna take them up to her parents' cottage for the rest of the month. - Maybe even longer.
I mean, the word is Izzy's got a little boyfriend up there. But I don't know, man.
if it's the kid I'm thinking of, she could do way better.
here, you know what? Hang a left here, and we'll take a spin down Queen Street.
you know, I'm thinking about joining the squad.
Yeah, just go straight like I said.
I think I'd be good. I mean, I was hanging out with Sue and some of the E. T.F. guys last night.
great bunch. They got stories.
here's a story for you. When I tell you to go left, go left.
you don't think I can do it. No, you know what?
epstein, I think you can do whatever you set your mind to, but tonight...
1507, we've got a commercial alarm at Bradshaw Secondary.
342 Baldwin. Southwest door and hallway motions.
1507 responding.
tonight, pal, let's just do this.
mark 1507 on scene. Seems quiet.
want me to take lead on this?
sure. You've been hanging out with the S.W.A.T. guys. You must know the protocol.
Yeah, actually, I do.
by all means.
if this were a diamond, there'd be four of us.
well, it's, uh, it's just the two of us.
I'll take point. You take right wing.
right wing. I'm on it.
move to threat.
okay.
pigs. I get it. I get it. It's because we're...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
Hey, that little guy right here, I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be you, man.
oink, oink. Hope you remembered your "keys"?
you know what? That's actually kind of funny.
you know, because some cops, they'll leave their keys in their cruiser...
leave the doors open going to a call.
no. No.
No!
this isn't happening.
go ahead, call it in.
you're lead on this, right?
what time is it?
I don't know. You, uh, threw my watch somewhere.
Yep, it's, uh, behind the chaise.
the what? - The chaise. The, um... The chair thing.
Oh, the chaise. - Yeah.
there it is. Um, you wanna grab the newspaper, and I'll make some coffee?
I-I can't. I-I gotta go. - What?
I told Jerry I'd meet him for some one-on-one. I'm already late.
I'll, uh... I'll see you at the station, okay?
Sam... - What?
come on. I mean, how long are we gonna keep this up?
I don't know. I'm in decent shape. I'd say I got another good 40 years.
even then, I hear they got pills for that. You know what I mean.
running out the door with last night's clothes?
it-it's like we're... we're teenagers.
and that's a bad thing? - Well, I guess not.
McNally, we got the whole day together at work, which is where I will see you in about an hour.
all right. - Okay.
you gotta be kidding me.
you're early. That was a late shift.
Ugh, yeah. Big raid in Riverdale.
$2. 2 million in heroin, booby-trapped with four pounds of C4.
Oh, yeah? How long it take you to dismantle?
it's not about speed. It's about safety.
Really?
let's just say I... set a new record.
Oh, hey. I heard you guys lost a squad car last night.
Oh. Yeah. Total gong show. Other platoon.
what are you doing now? - The park.
suicide drills. You wanna come? - Suicide drills?
thought you'd never ask.
you okay?
Yeah. Um... Superintendent's all over me on this missing squad car.
don't worry. We'll find it.
that, uh, decaf?
one cup won't hurt. - No, no, no, no, no.
not according to the internet.
decaf. Okay? See you in parade.
thank you.
it's weird, you know, these Glocks.
you really gotta commit.
our service weapons overseas-very sensitive little triggers.
you just need to use the tip of your finger.
Wow. Is that supposed to impress me?
depends. Did it work? You really haven't changed, have you?
well, in fairness, I'm in slightly better shape now, although you probably haven't noticed.
all I've noticed is that one of us grew up and became a real cop, and the other's just a boy polishing his little gun.
careful it doesn't go off in your hand.
now you all know- the whole city knows by now.
that Epstein and Shaw had their squad stolen out from under them.
I'm glad you all think it's a joke because that's what 15 looks like right now- a joke.
tech team tracked the squad's GPS and found it... removed.
so obviously, these guys - they know what they're doing.
well, actually, sir, it's not that hard.
uh, Dov and I found out how to do it online. You know, in case it ever came up...
are you done, Diaz?
Yes, sir.
I don't have to remind you guys that car is equipped with a very expensive computer and a loaded shotgun.
and if they figured out how to remove this, you can be damn sure they're gonna unlock that weapon.
last week of exams. Annual scavenger hunt.
high school kids all over the city are working to steal a bunch of stuff they don't need, by whatever means necessary. The list is always a secret.
last year's list included an owl from the zoo, 27's divisional sign, and a very large papier mache moose.
it's usually pretty harmless. - Not today.
these ass clowns have one of my cars and one of my guns, and I want it back.
so let's get out there and find them.
I did say "usually."
Yeah, and I said, "Not today."
Sam, um...
about this morning, I didn't really mean to freak you out.
you did not. Well, you disappeared pretty fast.
well, I had plans to kick Jerry's ass.
and, yes, I was trying to avoid the inevitable conversation, because the answer is "no."
I am not going to... A yoga class with you.
okay. I asked you about yoga one time.
twice. Twice.
but I still standby it. I mean, I think that you'd really like it.
it's good for stress.
and the winner is...
1505, uh, south bound on Gywnne.
uh, we're in pursuit of a silver S. U.V.
that's right, buddy. Nowhere to go. It's over.
guess he didn't hear you.
okay, boost me up. - go.
Hey. Don't move. McNally, open the gate!
Andy! - Yeah, Sam, he's injured.
no, I have to-I have to be somewhere.
that's fine. Just hold on a second, okay? Just stay here. It's fine,
McNally, open it!
Sam, okay! Just hold on a sec - McNally, what are doing?!
you okay? McNally!
Yeah. I don't think that's part of the scavenger hunt.
you all right?
I- I made a list- uh, Cherry Beach...
Brickworks, and the, uh, the quarry off Lake Shore.
all final meet-up spots for the scavenger hunt the last three years, where they dumped the stuff.
now I also listed some alternatives, places I'd suggest if I was playing this scavenger hunt.
there's, like, 20 places here. - Yep.
one says "outskirts"? Yeah, I mean, I was kinda riffing.
but look, I feel terrible about the squad. Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm not your therapist, Epstein.
look, this one is on me, too, all right? Everybody screws up once in a while.
it just happens that your "once in a while" happens...
a little more often. You know, it's not your fault.
what could you do, you know? Can't all be poster boys. Look at this.
idiot stick, we're right here!
does that hurt?
how about that? - Ow! Don't!
you're okay. You just got a good bruise.
okay, well, thank you for poking at it just to make sure.
you didn't draw on him. Why?
he's a kid.
what? I thought he was part of the scavenger hunt. He's lucky you were the one over the fence.
you had a runner? - Yeah.
McNally, you okay? - Yep.
okay. Small talk's covered. Why am I here?
we got maybe $4, 000, $5, 000 in cash and a whole lot of blood in the car.
damn. That's probably gonna hurt the resale value.
well, suspect was beat up. Said he had to get somewhere.
and it's probably too easy if it was the hospital, huh?
we got word out. No hits yet. Mm.
uh, this car is actually registered to a Stella Alverez. 17. Lives at 422 Revelstoke.
and your suspect was male? Guy named Stella?
maybe he's got really mean parents. Mm-hmm.
uh, the parking pass in there - It's for Westlake Collegiate.
you know, that new high school up in Forest Hill? Oh, rich kids. My favorite.
all right, I'm gonna identify the car. I'm going to send someone over to the house.
you guys go to the school and see if you can catch up with the owner.
okay.
it's a lot of blood.
Yeah, I feel bad. I'm sure he's a real angel.
okay, so you're gonna be alone for the whole summer?
Yeah. Yeah, it's great. I get to focus on the detective training, and Leo gets to spend the summer up north at his dad's cottage, so it's a win-win.
so Leo's gonna be canoeing, making bonfires, and building tree forts...
I guess. - And you're gonna be studying.
Yeah. - I really don't think you understand the concept of win-win.
I'm just-I'm just saying.
is he stealing that sign?
Hey. What's up?
you sure you're okay? You fell pretty hard.
it's cool. I'm good.
Hey, you're the cop from the billboards, right?
Yeah.
this one of your hotties? - No.
she's, uh, she's not a hottie. She- she's not my hottie.
you're a- she's a hottie. You're a hottie. She's just not mine.
she's Detective Jerry Barber's. - Okay.
this is Officer Nash. - Thank you, Officer Diaz.
all right. There are, uh, three different I. D. s here with three different names.
so what are we supposed to call you? - Friends call me T-Bone.
Oh. Wow, look at this.
you got the list? Scavenger hunt 2012.
Hey, look, the squad car's right at the top.
and, uh... And this sign's right at the bottom.
I totally found that list. You know, on the ground somewhere.
Yes, well, Mr. Bone, you're coming with us, answer some questions.
how's it going?
I'm fine.
what are you working on?
work.
can I get you anything? Coffee? Root beer? Candy bar?
I'm fine. Collins, you're supposed to be on patrol.
uh, we were, sir. Officer Williams had to turn back.
Why? - I'm not sure. She's in the locker room.
Hey, Noelle.
you all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
let me get that.
they're fine. They're on the list.
it's just a little cramping, all right? It's no big deal.
you gotta see a doctor.
first ultrasound's next week. I'll see her then.
okay, ow. - Okay, that's it. I'm taking you in.
no, no, you have to be here. I'll go. Just...
do something with my rookie, okay?
Oh, my god. I'm leaving. See? Going.
operation coffee station.
it's good to see all your military training being put to good use.
just keeping it safe for all the real cops.
are you free for a drink tonight? - No.
how about tomorrow? - No.
is this one of those things where I keep asking, you keep saying "no"?
Yeah.
Nick... We don't have anything to talk about.
well, I disagree.
if we're gonna be working together, we might as well get it out there, get it over with.
Collins. - Yes, sir?
I need to put Officer Williams on special assignment.
Absolutely. I'm sure Officer Peck here can handle me for a shift.
Yeah, too bad I'm not a training officer.
Oh, that's right. I just really wanted to look for that missing squad.
get him out on the road. Stay out of trouble.
anything she tells you to do, you do it.
happily, sir. I got a lot to learn. - Yeah, you do.
I don't understand. I'm totally fine. Why? What's going on?
well, actually, it's about your car. We just have a few questions.
my car? What's wrong with it?
did you drive it here this morning? - No.
did you lend it to somebody, maybe for the scavenger hunt?
boyfriend? Lab partner?
no, um, It's-it's been at my dad's garage all week.
look, I have a chem final in, like, ten minutes. So can you please just tell me what's going on?
Yeah, okay. Um, we're just actually following up on an... old report.
so it's probably nothing.
what's it count for? 50%, 60%?
75%. And Stanford wants all final grades.
Stanford? You must work pretty hard.
when I'm allowed.
well, we'll let you get back to it.
Oh, actually, where's your dad's garage?
um, It's on Eastern. Alverez Auto Body.
okay. - Your dad is Bobby Alverez.
Yeah. You, uh, you know him?
we've met. Well, good. Thank you.
Oh. And, uh, Stanford's a really great choice. Good luck.
thank you.
wait. You know Bobby Alverez?
I'm familiar with his work.
Wow. Poster guy. My friends are gonna be stoked.
this should have been on the list.
you need to focus, okay?
one of the guys involved in the scavenger hunt stole one of our cars.
Yeah, I heard.
what? How?
everybody knows - Guys who organize the hunt.
they're legends.
well, do these legends have names?
nobody knows who they are. They're like Batman and Robin, but, you know, cooler.
what's his name? - Well, I took three I. D. three names, all fake.
he won't tell us his real name.
but we've got a credit card belonging to Leslie Starzomski. Maybe stolen.
all right, I want you to stay on him.
find out everything he knows about this scavenger hunt.
and if he doesn't want to talk, threaten to charge him with fraud.
Bobby Alverez. Local business owner.
half the stolen goods on the east side come through here.
so it's a cash business.
I knew you paid attention in class.
who's this? - Officer McNally, J. T. Braga.
nice to meet you - you two need something?
we're here about a stolen car.
you mean the squad that got boosted last night?
that's gotta hurt. - Yeah, a different car.
we need to talk to Bobby. - He's not here.
well, his-his car's right there. You mind if I go in, check his office?
you got a warrant? - No, but I can get one.
but then it gets complicated. Detectives are gonna want in, major crime.
pretty soon, Bobby's throwing a big off party he didn't want to have.
just five minutes of his time. You can call him down here yourself.
you seen him today?
not since this morning.
Hey, Bobby, you back here?
Bobby! The cops are here. They wanna talk.
Bobby. - Looks like blood.
you got a key? No.
1505. We need a medic at 1776 Eastern.
he's alive.
copy that, 1505. An ambulance is on its way.
didn't even know this was here. It's nice.
that's why I brought you here, Nick.
sugar Beach. It's a whimsical new addition to the city's edge.
a playful destination to while away the afternoon with old friends
okay, fine. Fine. So what are we doing here?
I thought we were supposed to be looking for the squad car.
well, we are.
Chris e-mailed me the scavenger hunt list, and those umbrellas are on it.
okay. So we hang back, wait for some dumb kid to grab one. Hit the soft targets.
Yeah, something like that.
Hey! Casanova, her face is not your lunch. Get a job and get a room.
maybe I didn't change, but you sure have.
Why? Cause I'm doing my job? - No, cause you used to be fun.
don't get me wrong. You were always a bitch.
just... Not like this.
I must say, I kinda miss the old Gail.
Really?
because she didn't miss you at all.
looks like the kid was robbing the lockbox, prying it open with that, I guess.
then Alverez walks in, surprise, catches him in the act.
Yeah. Yeah. It's not exactly a precision job.
not exactly a precision criminal.
not if he's stupid enough to rob bobby Alverez.
all right, so...
kid walks in, and he beats Alverez, he locks this door, and then he runs out that one.
back lot. That's probably where he got the car.
Yeah.
prints are in from the car.
they belong to a Wyatt Cripton.
Yeah. He's an employee here. He's a mechanic apprentice.
but he wasn't working today.
Yeah, It's Jerry. - Do you know every one of these guys has a record?
it's not exactly a bank, McNally.
word's out.
Bobby's brother. Handles the west side.
then you know what? You guys better go pick him up before somebody else does.
I'm gonna get the warrant right now.
well, I think we must've checked most of the spots on your list, Epstein.
no squad car, so... maybe we should check the outskirts.
dude, easy. Relax.
we gotta find that car. - We are. We're looking.
if I don't find that car, I can't stay with Sue.
okay. Wait. You had me, then you lost me.
can we just go? No. I don't like it when you lose me, Epstein.
it makes me feel stupid. Which, for the record, I'm not.
all right, you said it yourself. More screwups land on me than anybody else, right?
I'm that guy.
Oh, and your girl Sue pretty much kicks ass for a living. - Pretty much.
that's what you're saying? - Yeah.
and you, on the other hand, had your squad car boosted by a bunch of stupid teenagers.
that's-that's exactly right. Can-can we go? Yeah. Yeah.
but look, pal.
look...
let's find that squad car.
yeah? Give me your list. Let's see what else you got.
we really gonna keep him in here?
Frank's pissed. Until we find that squad car, he's not cutting anybody any slack.
I mean, he's just a kid. He's just trying to be cool. He doesn't know anything.
well, let's make sure, 'cause, uh, that credit card he stole...
Leslie Starzomski has a 15-year-old son named Troy.
goes to Bradshaw.
sup, players? - Troy.
dude, you had to have known we were gonna run the credit card.
we've left a message with your mom, told her where to come pick you up.
she gave me her credit card for emergencies and stuff.
well, you've been lying to us all day. Why should we believe you now?
because, uh...
she's not here. She doesn't exactly live in the city.
well, what do you mean? Where is she?
she had to take a job in Kingston a couple months ago. Just for a bit.
she was driving back and forth every day, but it was totally wearing her out.
so now...
she just comes back on weekends. So you're alone the rest of the time?
it's not a big deal. I can look out for myself.
Troy, you're in a police station. - Is my mom gonna get in trouble?
okay, you're lying to protect your mom. I get that.
but why would you steal a sign?
I don't know. Trying to be badass. You probably think it's pathetic.
no. You know what's pathetic?
getting your squad car stolen by a couple of teenagers.
but anything you can do to help us... Now that would be badass.
they've been sending updates on twitter.
I'm sorry. They're tweeting about this?
Yeah. But they're using fake handles. I don't know who they are.
if they've got their geotags turned on, I can show you where they are.
let's get him his phone.
Cripton's file says that he's been in 22 foster homes.
I mean, he's barely out of high school. How is that even possible?
bad attitude. - What, so it's his fault?
guy's been arrested three times. Lots of kids go into foster care, come out just fine.
Wyatt, it's the police! We're inside.
looks like he came back and got cleaned up.
maybe he wanted to look his best.
God, some of these pictures are really good.
they got photography classes in prison. He'll get in free.
he's gotta know that the guys from the garage are looking for him.
why would he risk coming back here?
I don't know. Maybe he left something behind.
drugs, cash.
it's Stella Alverez. He knows her. Got a little crush on the boss' daughter.
she's still at the school. What if that's where he was trying to get to?
let's call the school, get them to find her, and hang on to her till we get there.
okay.
apartment's empty. I mean, we already called the school, and they're looking for Stella.
so what are we talking about? Stalker?
has his eye on the boss' daughter, starts following her around, taking her picture.
boss finds out- From the pictures, it looks like she knew him.
maybe the guys there know something.
not a good idea. - No, no, no, no, no.
Bobby's guys find the kid before we do, he's dead.
so I would rather not make him more dead.
we make sure Stella's safe, find the kid, then we figure it out.
what is Sammy saying? - He's basically just agreeing with you.
well, you see that? He's a smart man.
okay, call me when you get the girl. - Yep.
so these little high school boneheads, they, uh, they set us up and steal our car, and then they, uh... twitter about it to their friends?
Yeah, I mean, according to Chris' witness, they didn't use their real identities, but they forgot to turn off their trackers.
they should be right around the corner.
well, this place is on your list.
1509, we're in the west end of the Polson shipping yard.
1532 approaching. Copy. Standing by.
you know, my wife Zoe - Smartest woman I ever met.
that used to intimidate the hell out of me.
you made it work, right? - Yeah. Yeah.
well, I kind of figured she just sort of dug me for my square chin and broad shoulders.
you know, it's kind of a draw.
epstein, your girl is not with you because you're a good cop.
she's with you 'cause you're a good man.
1532 in position.
copy. Remember, there's a loaded shotgun in that car.
stay sharp.
ready? - Ready.
in three.
driver, this is the police. Turn the vehicle off now.
why are they just sitting there?
Chris, coming at you?
out of the car! Out of the car now!
hands above your head. On your knees, slowly.
driver, hands on your head! Proceed to the passenger side of the vehicle.
these little piggies are going to jail!
Oliver, the shotgun's missing.
all right, principal said that her last exam ended about 15 minutes ago.
she's probably still at her locker.
522, just outside the pool.
she's not there, we get bolt cutters, see if her stuff's still in it.
did you call her? - Yeah. No answer.
Hey, it's right here.
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.
uh, do you know Stella Alverez? Her locker's right there.
Yeah, kind of. Why? - Well, have you seen her today?
like, five, ten minutes ago. She met up with some guy.
What'd he look like? - Like he'd been in a car accident.
did you see which way they went? - That way, toward the auditorium.
okay. Thank you. - Thanks.
only chance, boys. Where is the shotgun?
I mean, this is bad. You guys stole city property.
but if somebody gets hurt with that shotgun, it gets worse.
prison worse.
we sold it. - To who?
guys we used to go to school with. Heard we boosted the car.
said he needed it for protection.
name.
name.
wait. What-what happened? Why won't you tell me what's going on?
why didn't you tell me?
tell you what?
that you're going away to school.
because I haven't decided yet.
that's not what your dad said.
my dad? Oh, my god. Did he do this?
he told me to stay away from you.
Stella, I tried to call you. - I was in exams.
Stella? What do you want?
just wanna make sure everybody's safe. You okay, Stella?
I'm fine. Wyatt? - Everything's fine.
we're just gonna go. Okay, please? We gotta go.
look, Wyatt, we wanna talk to you.
come down here. - McNally, he's armed.
Wyatt, get your hands where I can see them. - What did you do?
I was just trying to get my money from your dad. He owes.
get your hands where I can see them! - Tell me what you did!
Stella, I need you to calm down. - Wyatt!
tell me what you did, Wyatt!
Oh, my god. Wyatt! - Get down!
come on! Come on! Come on! - Wyatt!
let's go! He's got her! Let's go!
1505. Westlake Collegiate. There's multiple shots fired.
there's a single shooter with a hostage.
subject still at large. We've cleared the classes in the east wing.
copy that. Backup is at route.
Wyatt. Please.
police. Don't move!
this way. This way. - Wyatt. Just stop.
come here. Come on. Come here. Come on! Come on!
Wyatt. Wyatt, please. Let's - Let's just go back.
let's just give in to them. - It's gonna be fine, okay?
I promise you. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. Wyatt. Nowhere to go, buddy.
get back! - Wyatt, you gotta listen to me.
I said, stay back! - Put it down.
easy. Easy.
we just need to know Stella's okay. What happened to my dad?
he's in St. Pat's. He's alive.
see, he's fine. He's fine. He's okay, all right?
Wyatt, we've got about four minutes here.
E. T.F.'s on their way. Shots fired in a school. There's no negotiating.
I don't want to negotiate! - Wyatt.
why don't you let her go? Let her out. You can take your chances.
if you love her, you're gonna let her go.
of course I love her! That's why I'm here!
I just want us to be together, okay?
I mean, don't you?
I don't know. Team one is on scene.
okay, Wyatt. Time to let her go, buddy.
come on, guys.
Wyatt. - go.
go. If you want to go, go. Go.
Stella, go!
Sam, I'm going out.
it's okay. Come here. It's okay.
stay back.
all right, Wyatt. Your turn now.
no.
Wyatt, E. T.F.'s gonna be here any minute.
I don't care.
Sam. - It doesn't matter.
the shotgun is an 850. Double shots, auditorium, and four shots here.
all right. Cover me.
Yeah. Where are you going?
Wyatt, listen to me. - Sam.
don't make me shoot you.
listen to me. - Sam, get back.
Wyatt, your shotgun is empty.
it's empty. Come on.
turn around.
1505. This is McNally.
stand down. Subject secure. - Roger that.
it's okay.
my dad wouldn't let me date, especially anyone from his shop, but when I met Wyatt...
I thought maybe he could come with me.
Yeah.
we are so different.
and you told your dad.
he told me I couldn't go to school if Wyatt came...
and I didn't know what to do.
it's okay.
it's okay.
can I see my dad now?
Yeah. I'm just gonna take your statement, and then I'll take you right to him, okay?
his mom called.
she's gonna be another couple hours.
Hey, Trace, there's nothing we can do.
I'm making a mistake...
letting Leo leave for the summer so I can try and get this detective rotation.
look, you're not sending him away.
I mean, you know, you're letting him spend some time up north with his dad, and job or not, I think it's important.
I mean, Leo's gotta have fun, you know, and he's got to get to know his dad.
I wish my mom had done it for me.
Hey, T-Bone, you hungry?
Yeah, kinda. Nice. Let's grab a slice.
I know a great place around the corner, and, yeah, it's kinda badass.
so, uh... you staying in this division for good?
Yeah, well, this is where they put me.
well, then you're right. We'd better handle this.
this? - Us.
if you're staying here, we gotta figure out how this works.
ten minutes. I'll be outside.
I didn't want to hurt her.
I didn't want to hurt anybody.
I just wanted to be with her.
I tried to fit myself into her life.
I thought I could make her happy.
I should have known it wasn't gonna work.
Alverez is up. He's gonna be okay.
Stella's with him now.
good. That's good... for everybody.
you think we're too different, don't you?
what? - You don't think we're gonna last.
Andy, uh...
if we were the same, that kid in there might be dead right now.
Yes, we're different, so we'll deal with it.
is that what you really think?
I think you were ready to marry someone else six months ago.
Sam, come on. You gotta know, I mean, you and me- it's not the same.
okay, so what's the rush?
school shooter, huh? - Yeah.
well, team three said no one got hurt. - We got lucky.
here.
I lost the car. - What?
the squad that got boosted the other day- it was mine.
why didn't you tell me?
because, you know, you - You do everything so perfect. I was embarrassed.
I mean, you do suicide drills for fun.
Oh, my god.
dov, I hate suicide drills. I do them to impress you.
I'm impressed. Good, so then we don't have to do them anymore.
never again.
Hey, Zo. No, I'm, uh, I'm-I'm outside.
thought maybe I could come in and see the girls before, uh...
Oh, okay.
no. Yeah, you're right.
space is space. Yeah.
Yeah. I will see them on the weekend.
okay. Night.
you're sure you're totally fine?
Absolutely. I'm good. Completely healthy.
and, uh... The baby?
Yeah. Everything's perfect.
see?
perfect.
it's perfect.
let's go.
I wasn't ready. - That's three in a row.
I wasn't ready. - Yeah.
it's good to see that two tours of Afghanistan, and I can still drink you under the table.
well, It's good to see you're still in there somewhere.
come on. That was five years ago.
you know what? So what? Maybe I am a different person.
you learned to share popcorn yet?
no. - Still sleep with your socks on?
when it's cold. - You still listen to Kelly Clarkson?
I was 22. It was one song.
the same person.
friends?
friends. - Okay. I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna sit here, have one more drink, enjoy this whimsical, new addition to our city's edge.
okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
night, buddy.
thank you. - I'll walk you home.
I'm actually fine. - I'll walk you.
I'm kind of okay. - I'll walk you.
I'm fine.
one and a quarter cup right? Has to be exact.
cake's on fire. - What?
No!
Oh, no, no, no!
it's okay. I can salvage it. It's good, it's good.
I...
I would have used it.
well, that was close.
why are you having this thing again? You've been here... six months?
Yeah, and I never had a housewarming, and I think now is the time to say I am finally home.
put that back. It's for tomorrow. - You want that?
you want it? - Yes, I do want that. Put it back!
that is for tomorrow night! - Want that?
okay. What, you wanna play?
Oh, pull yourself together.
Claire. Hi. - Hi.
I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to drop something off, but I... I... I'm interrupting, right?
no. No, it's fine.
Yeah.
are you... having a party? - A housewarming, actually.
haven't you been living here for six months? - That's what I said.
I... I'm sorry I didn't invite you.
can I help with anything?
no. I was just gonna pick up some food and flowers after work tomorrow, - but I've got it covered. - Well, I... I can do that.
I... I could pick up food. I could drop it here in the afternoon.
uh... well, I... - Anyway...
I, um... I thought you might like these.
they're home movies of when you were little.
I got them transferred to DVD.
are you serious about the food? - Of course. I would be happy to.
um, is there someone here to let me in?
I'm gonna get you the spare key.
here you go.
don't worry about anything.
I've thrown dozens of parties. I know exactly what to get.
thank you.
it's nice to see you, Sam.
Bye. - Okay.
well, that was very helpful of her.
how long has she been back in your life? - Mmm... four weeks.
Oh, good. I thought you barely knew each other.
intubation. - Uh, correct patient positioning.
uh, depression of the pharyngeal reflex. - Immobilization of the patient.
well, isn't that obvious? - So then say it.
immobilization of the patient. - Very good.
you're not a doctor. - No, but my dad is.
Oh, you want another tutor? - Not till I pass this exam.
all right. I, uh... I gotta take off.
I'll see you after? - Yeah, just give me a call.
voluntary overtime after an all-night shift, and you decide to throw a party?
Hey, we can sleep when we're dead.
look, I need this. Progress is moving forward.
Andy McNally, zen master.
not really. More avoiding.
I wish Jerry would avoid me. - What?
I swear, working together and dating... it's like I'm his mini-me.
the other day I actually answered my phone, "go for Traci!
looking sharp.
you know what? Can you get me a coffee? I'm running late.
Oh. Detective Barber? I've been looking for you everywhere.
out of my face, Peck.
no, it's okay. Leave it. Leave it.
it's just Sue checking in. I'll talk to her later.
you guys in a fight or something? - No, no. We're great.
she's perfect. It's just me. I'm...
bomb chick, right? Sue?
sorry. I just forgot my gym bag.
so E. T.F. and a uni... how's that work?
same as any other relationship.
complicated, huh?
well, that's the thing about relationships. They always get complicated.
that's why you gotta keep things light. - Like you and Gail keeping it light?
just old friends who like each other's company.
she know that's all it is?
Hey, guys. Parade's in ten.
what?
thanks to one brave officer of 15, Gideon Santori...
Mr. public nudity... is finally off the streets.
kudos to Officer Collins, who took down Santori alone. OH, YEAH
Thanks.
up until now, Officer Collin has been riding with the T. O. - He's up.
not anymore. Stand up, Collins.
you... are cut loose, soldier.
all-night shift. The streets will be busy.
your job is to protect the people, even if they don't want you to.
let's get to it.
all right. Let's get to work.
we're riding together.
it's my first night without a T. O. I'm looking forward to it.
it'll be fun.
housewarming. What'd you get Andy?
my company's gift enough. You?
fondue pot. Well, technically it's from me and Chris, but, problem is we already used it. We're having trouble fitting it back in the box.
Oh, good. So she'll have nothing to put it in after she never uses it.
you gonna get that? - No, it's okay.
it's just Sue... checking in.
you're totally avoiding her. - Ah. No, I'm not.
it's okay. You need a little time apart, a little space.
Yeah. Well, you would know.
I mean, you're the expert on space, right? You and Nick.
but, uh, take it from me. From experience?
friends with benefits... somebody usually gets hurt.
Oh, right. 'Cause I'm a woman, so I couldn't possibly be interested in a relationship based solely on sex.
I like the way it is.
coffee.
make sure the lid's on tight.
Hey, Sue, it's me... Gail.
sorry.
no, I just thought you were someone else.
uh, yes, I can take a message.
okay, Crystal, do you have a last name?
Yeah. No.
I'll tell him.
you know what the best thing about my life is right now?
this guy. - No.
my life is a mess.
and for the first time, I'm not running around trying to fix it.
remember how you said, uh, neat and tidy's overrated?
Yeah, well, I'm puttin' my trust in that.
neat and tidy is who you are, you know? Don't drive your trust-mobile off a cliff.
okay, what happened to "don't overthink it"?
I'm just saying it's okay to be wary. You don't owe anybody anything.
anybody? You mean my mother?
you know, I spent 15 years analyzing why she left.
there's no way I'm spending another 15 analyzing why she came back.
unit 1505, call from Matador Alarm Systems.
silent perimeter alarm received at 1929 King and Parliament.
1505. We're on our way.
you know the best thing about silent alarms?
bells are ringing, but people don't know they're in trouble.
it's definitely a party.
it's a bunch of kids.
look over there. Definitely woo-girls.
Oh, yeah? You're telling me you're not a woo-girl, McNally?
Yeah, maybe. After a bottle of Tequila.
a whole bottle of Tequila, and I'm a woo-girl.
all right.
Hey, guys! Party's over! Go home!
excuse me there, kiddo.
all right, everybody, the party is over!
you got ten minutes before we start calling your parents!
if you have alcohol or anything illegal on you, set it down right now and head out!
Oh, my God!
that's definitely not a woo-girl.
this is Swarek. I'm at 1929 King Street, and I got a 20- to 30-year-old male who's seriously injured.
send a bus right away, please. All right, lock this place down right now!
nobody goes out. All these kids are potential witnesses!
all right, 1509 requesting backup.
stop! - Available units in the area...
move away from the exit! Let's go!
everybody, this is a crime scene!
I need you to stay where you are!
how's the victim?
couple of stab wounds, and the knife is right over here.
guy's unconscious. Uh, probably happened in the last hour.
anything on him might tell us who he is? - No wallet, no I. D.
just the clothes on his back and an old bag.
could have been homeless. Crashed here, hard up for money.
robbery gone sideways.
okay, well, I'll, uh, stick with I. D.E. N.T. and see what they come up with.
uh, I'll talk to I. D.E. N.T.
you go tell Diaz and Collins to stay with the victim.
and if he wakes up, I'm the first to know, yeah? - Yes, sir.
okay, and you two stay with the party kids. I'm sure someone saw something.
all right.
Hey, Jer. - What's going on, buddy?
if John Doe wakes up, take his statement, - but whatever happens, keep me posted. - No problem.
see you there. - Yeah.
can I ride with you guys?
my son didn't see anything. Can I take him home now, please?
like, I don't know why we're all losing sleep over some hobo who got shanked.
good question.
I'll be sure to explain it you when I take your statement... after everyone else's.
all right, look at me and state your name.
you okay?
did this stuff leak into your brain? I'm talking to you.
Yeah, I'm really sorry about this. - Sorry about what?
son of a...
Sam. - McNally, don't make me run after little girls!
stop. Get a leg!
come on. You're not going anywhere.
let go! - No!
was that so hard?
Oh, come on!
uncle Sammy, please. My dad can't know I was at that party.
uncle Sammy"?
Shaw? Izzy Shaw? As in Oliver Shaw's daughter? - Yes.
What'd you do back there? - Kicked a cop.
Oh, come on. I'm begging you. Just let me go.
it's gonna be tough. Your dad's here.
please.
please? If my dad finds out, he's gonna kill me.
if he sees me helping you, we are both going down.
what if, uh... what if you sneak her into one of those squad cars?
okay? I'll distract Oliver, you go get the keys and just take her home.
Yes, and what do we tell the officer she assaulted? - It's Gail.
look. Gail knows what it's like to be a daughter of a cop. You don't.
she's gonna wear this way longer than it's worth.
did you see anything in there tonight?
no. Nothing. I swear.
okay.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
everything my mom says about you is a total lie.
just don't make us regret it, all right?
nice work, Uncle Sammy.
Hey. Where is she? Did you get her?
Yeah, I wanna see the kid that kicked Gail Peck's ass.
what? No. She, uh...
well, we wrestled her. Sam's taking her in. - Not until I get an apology!
blue!
what kind of parent would let their kid do that to their hair?
how's it going in here, anyway? Busy?
got a haircut, didn't you? Didn't even notice.
Hey, are you okay? Did you bang your head in the alley or something?
God, I did, actually. You wanna check it out for me?
it's just in this area.
look at me!
Izzy? - No.
Izzy, what are you doing here?
she's, um... she's... she's... - Not you. Not you, her.
Isabella, what are you doing here? - I was at the party.
yeah? Does mom know that you're here?
what do you care? It was just a party. - Just a party.
you know what, We'll go down to the hospital. We'll talk to the guy who got stabbed here tonight, and he can tell us if it was just a party.
take her in. - Dad!
Oliver... - Did I stutter, McNally?
no, it was... on what grounds? - Parent of the year, once again.
on the grounds that that's my kid, who is a minor who assaulted a police officer, and when I tell you to do something, McNally, you do it!
Yes, sir.
so I'm not, like, seriously under arrest, right?
no, but I think you're seriously in trouble.
Sammy! I got that info you requested.
Oh, uh, could you hold on to that for me?
cause I got my hands full right now. - Ah, you know what? I'll take it.
keeping secrets, Officer Swarek?
you're looking into my mom?
you wanted me to get to know her.
Yeah, okay. Let's get to know her.
can I sit down at least?
no. - No.
all right, so we got a couple of speeding tickets here.
she's got a lead foot.
guess I'll be driving. - Andy.
credit check. Wow, that is really thorough.
like 90% of the population, she's in debt.
God, I am learning so much right now.
all right, okay. Enough, please? - No way.
not before we get to the big reveal... her birth date.
Sagittarius.
I need some air.
epic fail, Uncle Sammy.
if you're not giving a statement, shut up!
you.
backpack.
what's your name? - Amber Klein.
how'd you hear about the party? - My friends.
you see anything? - No.
what about this guy? You see him?
is he the one that got stabbed?
you mind telling me where this blood came from?
I... I don't know. I... I've never seen that sweater before in my life.
you do that yourself? Looks good.
no offense, but I'm really not in the mood for bonding right now.
okay.
look. My dad was a cop, so if it feels like Oliver's being really hard on you, it's because he's trying to keep you safe.
look, you have to be an adult about this. He's trying to protect you.
like Uncle Sammy's trying to protect you?
no, 'cause it's very different. - Cool hair.
blue.
are you on something now? - Hardly.
fine. Took some oxy. Whatever.
you took some oxy?
did you hear that, McNally? She took some oxy. "Whatever.
well, that's... that's... that's no big deal.
what are you gonna do, throw me in jail?
worse.
you called mom?
I thought she was sleeping. She must have snuck out.
it's like one day you wake up, and you're living with a stranger.
well, she'll find her way back, you know?
the worst thing you can do is over-protect her. She'll just push you away.
Oh. Parenting advice from Sam Swarek.
and what have you got to say for yourself?
I love you?
let's go.
Zoe, I'll come by the house after shift.
no, don't, okay? We'll talk about it tomorrow.
I gotta go. The girls are in the car.
no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.
how long has she been like this? - Ever since you left.
Oh. Ever... that's good. That's a good one.
ever since I left? - Yeah. I gotta get her home.
well, hey, Zoe... Zo...
okay, where... where did I go wrong?
you didn't. She's just being what's natural. - A pain in the ass.
a teenager who thinks she's invincible. - Happens to the best of us.
wait a minute. Are we... we're still talking about me here, right?
looking for Jerry. - Why? What's up?
Peckstein found a bloody sweatshirt on one of the warehouse kids.
suspect's been brought in. - What... which one? What's her name?
I chipped that kid's tooth.
you had a busy night. - No, no, no, no, no.
two summers ago. Badminton. Amber Klein.
that's Izzy's best friend.
she already told you. She doesn't know where that shirt came from.
then why did our officers find it in her bag?
amber, do you know who it belongs to?
we're making the assumption that it's not yours, - but I know that you're hiding something. - Should I be calling my lawyer?
detective Barber, can I see you for a minute?
Jerry. I got this.
it's a teenage girl and her mom. It's kind of my specialty.
wait. Are you asking me to step out of the interview?
I'm just trying to show you that I can do more.
it's just these past couple of shifts have been a lot of picking up your coffee.
I just... instead of doing my job, I feel like I'm... I'm...
detective in training? - I was gonna say girl Friday.
okay, Traci, look. Y... you're low rung on the ladder.
you're doing this stuff because it is your job.
you know, I was doing it when I was starting out.
but it kind of feels like you're enjoying bossing me around a little bit.
or maybe you expect some special treatment. No?
okay. Uh, why don't you start filing the case from last week, - and I'll get back to the interview, okay? - Jerry...
no, no, no. You go ahead. Oh, and you know what?
get me can of soda when you get a sec.
I'm Officer Diaz. This is officer Collins.
we'd like to ask you some questions.
we didn't find any I. D. on you. Got a name?
Nick. I, uh, noticed your tat.
where were you stationed?
Yeah. Anyway, um...
can you tell us what happened tonight, Alan?
I was looking for a place to stay.
I found that warehouse. It was decent, so I set up for the night.
yeah? Then what happened?
well, the kids show up ready to party. I decide to take off.
on my way out, I see this guy shoving around a girl.
so I decide to step in.
suddenly they both come at me. I was trying to protect her.
no good deed goes unpunished, right?
Yeah. You said it.
do you know which one stabbed you?
Yeah. The guy was... average height, dark hair, mean eyes.
he was wearing a denim vest, long-sleeved shirt. Probably in his 20s.
and the girl that was with him... what'd she look like?
she was young.
I don't know. Regular, except for the hair.
what do you mean? - It was bright blue.
actually looked kinda cool.
she was up all night.
she's exhausted. Do you have to take her back to the station now?
the victim I. D.'d her. She is a material witness.
Yeah, well, maybe the victim's wrong. - I'm hoping that he is.
her room? - Yeah.
she's gone.
where would she go? - I don't know.
out the window. Sam, Izzy's gone.
what do you mean? Where are you? I told you to wait for me.
what?
all right. Stay put in case she comes back, all right?
mcnally and I will start looking, all right? You stay there.
Izzy Shaw took off.
okay. I'm gonna take another run at the Klein girl. Come on.
Mrs. Klein, Izzy Shaw ran away, so if Amber knows something, she needs to tell us now.
amber, do you know where she is?
okay, let me help you. She was last seen with some guy...
average height, dark hair, long-sleeved shirt, denim vest?
I... I don't know. I don't know Izzy that well.
y... you don't... you don't know Izzy that well?
well, that's not what Izzy's dad says. So why don't we try this again?
the guy who was stabbed said a girl matching Izzy's description was there.
what do you know about that? - You're scaring her.
I got an officer's daughter missing. I got another guy in the hospital, so I couldn't care less if princess here is a little shaken up by the questions.
okay.
trace, I need you.
amber, I'm sorry. I know it's been hours, but we just...
we can't figure out how this bloody sweater ended up in your bag.
that's not her bag. I've never seen that before in my life.
well, if it's not yours, whose is it?
amber, when did Izzy dye her hair?
I don't know. About a week ago, I guess.
she just wanted to try a new look.
Why? Was she... was she hanging around with new people?
was she trying to fit in?
just 'cause that's what I do.
there's a new crew, new me.
except, uh, you can really lose yourself that way if you don't have good friends looking out for you.
the thing is sometimes it's hard to call people out.
it takes guts.
amber, who are you protecting? Whose bag is it?
it's Izzy's, okay?
she left it behind, so... I just grabbed it.
I didn't know anything was in it. I just didn't want her to get in trouble.
well, do you know who she might be with tonight?
she's with T. K. okay?
she kept him a secret from her parents because... he's older.
T. K? T. K? Wh... what is that? Is that a name?
he's a dealer, okay?
I don't know what his real name is. That's what everyone calls him.
do you know where he might be?
I don't know.
but he's... he's probably with Izzy.
I'm gonna call Zoe and see if she knows who this T. K. is.
I never heard of the guy. - Well, he's the best chance we got at finding Izzy right now.
Yeah, well, what if we don't? She could be halfway to who-knows-where.
you need to calm down. Can you do that for me?
don't "good cop" me right now, okay?
I'm not some hysterical mother who just walked into your division. I'm your wife.
Yeah, that's the reason I've been sleeping in a motel the last four months.
got it.
Hey, I'm coming with you. - No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, Zoe, you have to stay here, okay?
we gotta work as a team. In case Izzy comes back.
I'm gonna find this T. K. guy and I'm gonna see what he knows.
don't let anything happen to her.
Oh, honey, this is our girl. This is our girl out there.
if anything happens, anything...
I promise I'm gonna find her and I'm gonna bring her home.
okay. Well, I think I got everything I need. The witness saw nothing.
thank you very much for your time. Have a good day.
you done abusing your meager power?
two paths diverge in the woods, Gail. He chose the wrong one.
next time he'll make a better choice.
right. Yeah. Better choices.
such a hypocrite.
once again, I have no idea what you're talking about.
well, you left your phone in the squad earlier.
dov, please tell me that's not the girl whose brother you shot.
you had no right to answer my phone. - What are you doing with her?
I drive her around every once in a while... to class, to work... that's it.
because of me, her brother's never coming back.
dov, so, what, you're... you're hanging around her to remind her of that?
no, to remind me. So I never forget.
okay. I... I know you killed somebody, and I'm not gonna pretend to understand what that feels like, - 'cause I don't... - You're right. You don't.
so mind your own business.
we got a lead on your case.
once we get confirmation, we can have you I. D. them.
Yeah, well, you know where to find me.
until you get better. Then what?
you're wearing a wedding ring. Is this anyone we should call?
no. I messed that up a while ago.
ring's the only thing I have left.
patch of bad luck.
Hey, we're not going just yet.
Oliver's daughter is out there somewhere. I'd like to find her.
look, guy served, all right? We're part of the same family.
and you're not part of 15's? - Not according to you, I'm not.
just a few phone calls. That's all I'm asking for.
just let me find someone who cares about this guy.
so we ran a search on the initials "T. K." We got a few matches.
amber I. D.'d Taylor K. Hickman as our boy.
25, couple of drug charges, assault, stat rape.
nice. Got an address?
Yeah, 1211 Straithwaite Drive, apartment 203.
we gotta keep Oliver away from this, okay?
so just make sure he stays in the house. I don't want him involved.
Yes, I know. We're heading over there now.
who is it? - T. K. it's just me.
you gotta be 25.
what do you want? - Izzy Shaw. Izzy Shaw?!
is she here? - No.
no? Open the door and let me see.
I don't think you can come in here without a warrant.
no. I got a warrant.
wait... okay... Here...
that's Oliver's squad.
let's get in there.
Izzy Shaw... where is she? Where is she?! - I don't know. I don't know.
you seen her? Tell me where she is. - No. I don't know!
what are you doing here?
get over here! Did you do that to my daughter?! Did you do that to my kid?! Huh?!
dad! Dad! It's not that bad! - Did you do that to her face?!
your dad's a cop?! - Dad, just stop it!
you the one feeding drugs to my daughter?
I'm not telling you anything, okay? I know my rights.
you want to take me in? Take me in.
you're not going anywhere.
Oh, Uncle Sammy... my dad. I... he locked the door.
it's okay, Izzy.
you okay? - Yeah.
Oliver, open up the door!
got it covered, got it covered, McNally.
Oliver, open the door!
this psycho's got a gun on me! - I asked you a question.
what are you doing, man? Is this you? This isn't you.
it is today.
so are you gonna shoot him? - Thinking about it.
you see his rap sheet?
it's justifiable. I'm gonna get a medal.
you back me up?
Yeah.
Yeah. Whatever you need.
this isn't happening.
Oh, I screwed up. I just so screwed up. I'm never home.
I made this mess, now I'm gonna clean it up.
you can't shoot me. I'm unarmed! - Why? Isn't this how you do it?
huh? Preying on the weak!
little girls that can't defend themselves. - I'll stop. I swear.
I... I... I'll stop. I'll stop. Please.
Oliver. No matter what happens, we're gonna walk out of here together today.
that's a fact. So, whatever happens...
we'll just have to live with it.
daddy, please don't do this. Please don't do this!
please. Please. Please.
she just saved your life.
it's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay.
I just... I got a little bit lost for a moment.
it's okay!
don't think I'm not reporting this!
every single thing. - I don't think anyone's gonna care.
I gotta get her home. Zoe's gonna be worried.
you're... you're a good dad.
Yeah, right.
what happened? - Oh, Banks went in for surgery.
they found Izzy. Andy sent a photo over for Banks to identify.
Taylor K. Hickman.
guy looks like a real winner.
so did you find his wife?
Yeah. She wants nothing to do with him.
no next of kin. Guy's got nobody.
it's probably why he signed up in the first place.
why'd you? Sign up, I mean.
I liked the commercials.
I don't know.
always liked helping people. Looking for somewhere to belong, I guess.
my parents died when I was a kid, so...
we should get Banks to I. D. that photo.
uh, there... there are some outreach programs.
I know a couple people. I could make a few calls.
no man left behind, right?
all right, disco nap.
I'm gonna call you at 6: 00, and then we'll head over to Andy's.
I don't know what I'm doing.
with what? - Crystal.
I'm... I'm picking her up. I'm dropping her off.
I'm buying her groceries. I'm helping her with her homework.
it's like I'm her boyfriend, except she hates me.
Yeah, well, you can't punish yourself forever.
that's my job.
I can't keep doing this. I'm gonna end it.
I'm gonna call her and I'm... I'm just gonna end it. So...
thank you.
I messed up. I know. Sorry.
Hey. Look.
this face makes my whole world, my whole life, worth living.
every inch, every inch.
you got the whole world at your fingertips.
I just... I gotta make sure you don't screw it up.
I miss you.
I... I miss you, too.
I'm so sorry. It's okay.
it's okay. She's okay. You... you know. It's okay.
she's fine. She's fine.
Oh, my God. Look at you.
Hey. Do you want to come in?
Yeah.
party time.
uh, technically, she's a capricorn on the cusp of sagittarius.
but it's a common mistake. Don't let it get you down.
how'd you know I wasn't gonna shoot?
uh, I didn't. But that's my brother out there.
right or wrong, no matter what, I'm gonna back him up.
Yeah, well, what happens when you can't?
it's never come up.
so is that... what this was?
you were just backing me up? - Yes, as a matter of fact.
I didn't find anything. - That's not the point!
I can't even believe you did that. Behind my back.
over something that really doesn't concern you.
Mm. She finds herself back in your life... by accident...
and, uh, now she wants to be a part of your life?
I'd hate to see her break your heart again.
you know, I don't need you weighing in on everything.
you said you liked messy.
well, this is me messy, okay?
I made a mistake.
I went about it the wrong way.
I'd like to give you a ride home.
well, I guess it beats taking the trust-mobile.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
that's okay. The early bird gets the worm.
you are now the proud owner of the kitchen creative SX-300.
thank you very much.
look, this is seriously amazing. Who... who did this?
Dov and I chipped in.
she's talking about the decorations.
excuse me.
mom, I...
thank you.
no. I missed so many chances to throw you a party.
I didn't want to miss this one.
what do you want to drink?
whiskey. - Oh, good choice.
everything's great but her face.
okay, look, about today... I just want to s... - Let... let me start.
you were just treating me like a detective in training, which is what I am.
you're my senior officer, and I need to respect that.
so, please, no more work talk.
it's a party! - All right.
well, in that case, let's talk about how I am going to destroy you on the dance floor tonight.
there's no dance floor.
not yet, there isn't.
so you having a good time?
where is, uh, Nick?
Oh, he, uh... he ran into someone tonight.
I think he's still catching up. - Is she pretty?
I guess so. I mean, you know, if you're into beards.
80 questions, multiple choice.
I think I only passed because of you.
thank you so much... for everything.
glad I could help.
uh, so where'd you park your car? We should get going.
uh, it's just... - Right.
uh, Crystal. - What?
I, uh...
I gotta leave you alone. - Are you kidding me?
I'm... I'm... I'm trying to do the right thing here.
Oh. The right thing for who? - For both of us.
I didn't know how to do it before, but...
but you figured it out, huh? - Yeah. I did.
being around you, it made me feel better, but... - Oh! You forced yourself into my life!
you didn't give me a choice! - I... I know.
I didn't want this! You can't walk away from us after everything you've done.
I know. It was wrong. - You killed my brother! You killed my brother!
you can't do this to me. - I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
don't go.
where is it? - Suspect is armed and dangerous.
his name... Kevin Michael Ford. - All your cars have them.
42 years old. - Where is it?
currently resides at 30 Furlough Street.
wanted for the shooting of Officer Chloe Price.
okay.
okay. Here we go.
this is gonna be good.
no.
seriously. This is going to be good.
all right. When was the last time - you saw Kevin Ford? - Two weeks ago.
the night before his neighbor beat him up.
and you have not seen him since? Not today? Not yesterday?
you haven't driven by his house or checked up on him at the hospital?
Sam, I said I haven't seen him.
Hey, what's up? - You're not gonna like it.
I can't stand it when you open with that.
don't open with that. - McNally?
hit me.
I'm in Marlo's basement. It's all Kevin Ford.
maps, photographs, notes, charts. It's...
it's crazy.
Andy she must have been following this guy for weeks.
look, no one's seen it yet.
I'm still waiting on Oliver. - Okay.
just keep me posted.
what?
Marlo, I think we need to talk about what's in your basement.
this is 1527. I'm still waiting on backup.
1504, what's your 20?
1504, almost there.
you okay? Yeah. Yeah I'm... I'm fine.
good. See you soon.
thank you. - Right on.
listen, Wes, there's something I need to tell you.
Chloe and I are, um... seeing each other.
why didn't you say so?
well, 'cause, you know, this whole thing caught me off guard.
I didn't know about you.
and I didn't know she'd been married.
not sure if that says more about - my relationship with her or yours. - Yeah. Me neither.
is it serious... you and her?
Yeah. - You had to think about it. You sure?
Yeah, because this is weird. Okay?
I don't even know you. And... and... and... and...
you're... you're asking me if I'm serious...
if... about... - My wife.
exactly. So, yes, Wes, I'm very into your wife.
your wife and I are going steady.
you make her happy?
I think so.
you had to think about it again. - Well, you're impatient.
I'm just trying to gauge what I'm up against.
what's happening? - Ford's lawyer just got here.
what's that mean? It's the usual, you know, you guys got it all wrong.
my client's a great guy, he loves puppies. He's innocent.
my client is out of his mind.
uh, former client, I should say.
Kevin called me into the hospital, said he wanted to file a lawsuit against the police.
he claimed that you guys were persecuting him, following him, framing him for crimes he didn't commit.
but when I told him that it would take a few weeks to look at the facts, he attacked me.
it took two nurses to get him off me.
why didn't you report it?
I was afraid he was going to come after me.
look, I have worked with Kevin for a while, and he's always been a bit of a loner.
but this was insane. - What did the hospital say?
they said he had suffered a traumatic brain injury.
erratic behavior, paranoia, trouble with impulse control.
so he thinks he's being persecuted by the police.
now anyone in particular? - Yeah. 15 division.
he said he wasn't gonna stop until it was over.
okay, listen up.
as most of you know, we believe our shooter to be one Kevin Ford, 42 years old, Caucasian male, suffering from a severe traumatic brain injury.
former suspect in a missing child investigation.
we got officers at his workplace, and a B. O.L. O. out on his van.
uniforms are at Ford's house. It's empty. He's not there.
all right. We'll get over and check it out.
his parents are deceased. We need to find his brother.
abe Ford, 50 years old, 673 Parkside Road.
peck, Diaz... bring him in. Keep it friendly.
we're on it. All right. The rest of you,
I want you out on patrol in pairs.
okay, we're looking for a white panel van. The plate number's on the handout.
and be careful out there. - Good to see you, officer. Glad you're safe.
Nick's at her house right now. - All right. We'll send forensics over.
Swarek, you good to take her statement? Yeah, yeah, we're good.
okay, we have to explain this to them. Explain what? There's nothing we can do.
they're going to find everything now.
take it easy. All right?
mom would kill me if anything happens to you. - Yeah. Please.
she wouldn't even notice.
don't worry, Detective. I got her back.
always have, always will.
Holly, hey.
Hey. - You said that already.
you know, it sounded familiar. I just wanted to see you.
you know, take ten minutes, lay eyes on you.
Oh. Okay, so that's how we're gonna do this.
Gail, we should probably get going.
just... just be careful, okay?
I will.
so everything in your house is now evidence.
I should have packed it up. Burned it.
I wasn't thinking straight. You know that.
look, the, uh, silver lining is that...
that you know more about this guy than anyone else.
okay, so let's start thinking about that.
what do you we know? - You heard from Oliver?
no. Why? - 'Cause he still hasn't shown up.
Nick can't reach him. Celery hasn't heard from him.
I just tried to call him three times, - and his cell phone is off. - What does dispatch say?
apparently he's been parked in the same location for the last 45 minutes. 3900 Lake Shore.
I'll be here.
this is 1519. There's no car here.
can you please repeat the location?
GPS on car 1504 still reads 3900 Lake Shore.
okay. Well there is no 3900 Lake Shore.
I mean, it's an empty lot. - Andy.
1519, we're trying to narrow it down.
we found it. We found the sender unit.
it's been taken out of the car.
sorry, go again. You found the car? - No, we found the box.
the car is missing.
there's no sign of Officer Shaw.
final act preparations.
he turned down the heat, paid his bills, even laid his suit out.
this was taped to his computer.
Yeah. It's a hit list.
last radio contact was 39 minutes ago.
Oliver said he was on his way here. So what, he never showed?
he did.
his unit locator pinged him at this address about an hour ago.
if he'd already been here, why did he say he was on his way?
okay, got it. The guys just found Ford's van around the corner.
what about Oliver's cell? There's no signal.
they got techs working on the van, uniforms are searching the park.
for what? A body?
what does that mean? - Detective...
there's something I think you need to see.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, you two...
look, as soon as we're done here, I want you back at the station.
you stay there until this is over.
what? - Why?
Frank, this is Oliver. We need to be in this.
Kevin Ford made a hit list, Sam, and you're on it.
so is McNally, so is Chloe, who's now in I. C.U.
so is Oliver, who's now missing.
so until further notice, you're both staying at the damn station.
what is this? Looks like Marlo was doing her research.
she's got copies of every file on Kevin Ford, every interview with him, about him.
it stretches back about three years. There's even a timeline.
why aren't these confidential files back at the station?
you want to tell me what's going on?
Marlo had a hunch. Clearly she was right.
excuse me?
Luke... she slipped up, but she's back on her meds. She's... she's better now.
meds for what?
meds for what? She's bipolar.
she had a manic episode... just a break.
so she ended up focusing all of her energy into Kevin Ford because she thinks that he killed the kid three years ago.
you both have been covering for her?
she was right. Okay, she was right.
look at where we are. Look at what he's doing. She was dead right about the guy.
Yeah.
box it up, bring it to the station. Maybe there's something we can use.
I'm not talking to you about this right now. We have an officer missing.
so how does this work? We wait for her to wake up, and then we duel?
guns or knives? How do you feel about pub trivia?
you must be miss price's husband.
can I have a word? - Uh, actually, I'm her husband.
Oh, okay. A... and you are?
boyfriend.
everything okay?
unfortunately, the latest C. T. shows a clot in her carotid artery, where we repaired the gunshot wound. And I think we should remove it.
we've got a window of opportunity here, and if we leave it,
I'm concerned that she could suffer a stroke, neurological damage, possibly even paralysis. So... what are we waiting for?
as with every procedure, there are risks, and you should know what they are.
risks? What kind of risks?
we'll need to clamp off the damaged artery to get to the clot.
problem is she has swelling on the other side.
if that swelling increases while we're operating, there's a possibility that she might not get sufficient circulation, which could lead to brain death.
how much of a possibility? - I'd say it's unlikely.
but given her condition, it's hard to quantify.
what are the other options? We monitor the situation.
treat her with anticoagulants, and maybe the clot dissipates naturally.
it's a lot to process. Does she have other family you should talk to?
Yeah. Um... I'll try calling them again. But, doctor, what do you think we should do? I think I should operate.
and soon.
I'm just making myself useful. Keeping busy.
um... I was gonna go get some decent bread, but the guy at the front...
I was gonna go to the health food store, and he wouldn't let me leave. So I don't know.
I figure Oliver's going to be really - hungry when he gets back. - Celery, Oliver is missing.
we're doing everything we can to find him. I promise we are gonna bring him back.
Oh, God. Okay.
um, what can I do?
nothing. Just sit tight.
we're gonna find him. - Okay. Thanks.
I gotta go.
okay, Collins, Swarek, McNally...
you will remain at the station until further notice.
the rest of you, we're looking for Oliver's squad.
1504. Right now it's our only lead.
detective... we've got Kevin Ford's brother in interview one.
great. Thanks. Nash.
Callaghan, if we're going to make sense of these notes, we need to bring Marlo into this.
that's up to you, Detective.
at this point, what does it matter?
all right. Collins, - do you want to get Marlo in here, please? - All right.
what? He's out there somewhere.
and we can't even leave the station.
okay. We don't need to leave, all right? We need to use our heads.
Andy, we work together, we will find him 'cause that's what we do.
honestly, I... I haven't seen him in over a week.
is there another place that he might go... another address? Another workspace?
I mean, I saw him in the hospital.
he was losing it. He was like a different person.
but...
you know, you guys haven't exactly made it easy on him.
all right? You've hauled him in here over and over again, accused him of... of... of abducting children... of... of hurting children.
of course he's upset. Upset?
abe, your brother's shooting police officers.
I don't know where he is. I swear to God, I don't know.
I don't even want to see him again. I told him that in the hospital.
you told him what? - I cut him off.
I thought he was going to kill me right there.
Kevin, right?
you want to talk about this?
cause me... I'd kind of like to talk about this.
I'm a little confused here.
confusing getting hit in the head, huh?
everything goes a little... - you know.
it's gonna be good.
okay. Kevin, what are you doing?
settin' the scene. Settin' the trap.
I know you.
you were there the day I got attacked. - Yes. Yeah, I was...
I arrested the guy that assaulted you.
I was in your house. I called E. M.S. for you.
funny, considering - you put him up to it. - What?
Yeah, I know what's going on.
look, I saw what she did. That bitch has it out for me.
and you're part of it. So, don't.
just don't.
Oliver Shaw. You're on my list.
okay. All right. List.
Kevin, what list are you talking about? Already got one of them.
uh, what's her name? Price?
the chickie with the... the brown hair.
I only wish I got both of them. That would have been sweet.
uh, but you know... You win some, lose some.
I don't want to talk anymore.
that officer that you shot... she's still alive.
I said I don't want to... - Chloe Price is still alive.
I don't want to talk anymore! - You got a chance to get out of this.
you got a chance! - Shut up!
you have a chance to... - Get up!
nobody listens to me!
Gail, we're gonna find him.
that's what people kept saying to me when Christian was missing.
I know they were just trying to make me feel better, but it worked. So, Gail, we're...
we're gonna find him. That's all I want.
okay, we find Oliver.
he makes a very dumb joke.
Chloe gets out of the hospital. I make fun of her to her face.
we go back to the Penny.
we stiff Dov the bill.
I mean, that's life as it was. That's life as it should be.
Oh, my God, we've had it very, very easy.
I don't know.
last year was pretty rough. - Honestly, that... feels like it happened to somebody else.
I mean, I...
I don't really feel anything for months, but...
I got mean. Messed things up.
it seems very... stupid right now.
I don't know. Maybe... maybe that's part of the point.
part of the... plan.
thank you, Confucius.
I'm just saying, when it's dark enough, you can see the stars.
three years ago, Marcus Hartley went missing.
Kevin Ford was the number one suspect.
his alibi... it just didn't add up.
they never found the boy... - Marlo. Marlo, right now we just need to find Ford, okay?
y... I know. I...
look, you've been tracking this guy for weeks.
let's just... let's just talk it through, see if we can figure this out, okay?
okay, uh, the 11th? I mean, work. Work.
there was a drop-off at the store, and then she was in for the rest of the night.
same for the 12th, same for the 13th.
the 14th is Saturday. Why do I know that?
well, there's nothing until 3: 00 P. M. the next day.
well, let's check it anyway. - It's not gonna have anything.
why... what? Why?
because you went away that weekend.
remember? Chicago.
you went to that place downtown. You went to the restaurant where you got served by blind people.
relax. I wasn't spying on you.
Oliver told me.
14th... let's, uh, let's check it, okay?
fine.
it's just a parking ticket.
3550 Queen. - Where is that?
Mm. Queen and Shannon, maybe? Yeah.
wait, wait, wait, there's two more.
3552 Queen. 3598 Queen.
Marlo, uh, Queen and Shannon... what are we talking about?
you filed a couple of parking tickets all around the same address?
I... I don't know.
I would have taken them off his van and just filed them by date.
okay. Queen and Shannon.
there's a, uh, camera store, post office...
a couple of restaurants... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
there's four more tickets in the system.
all of them unpaid, in the same intersection.
Sam, they're all from this week.
queen and Shannon... mean anything to you?
we used to live around there when we were kids.
my dad worked in the area, so... Where did he work?
he worked security at one of the churches on Queen.
a rough area back then, so they needed someone in there at night.
but that was years ago, before, uh, before he started his business.
is there any reason your brother would go back there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess there's about a million reasons... - Abe.
please.
why would he go back to the church?
my dad wasn't, uh, the best father.
you know?
wasn't a nice man.
what do you mean? He used to t...
he used to take one of us with him...
to work two or three times a week.
uh, and we'd come home in the morning, and then we'd have...
breakfast and every time, it was like it didn't...
it didn't happen. You know, but...
it does. It...
it happens.
it's how you deal with it that... that... that matters you know, and... and...
and, uh, and so I, you know, I pulled myself together.
but Kevin...
he fell apart. By the time he was 14, he was drinking every night.
mm, blacking out every weekend. And... and... and...
he's... he was a mess.
Hey. We got our connection to the church.
it turns out their father was abusive to them both. The church is where it happened.
well, let's go. Let's check it out. - You're not going anywhere.
okay, we do this with E. T.F. - I'll call Bailey.
all units, 10-33.
what are you doing, Kevin? You know what I'm doing.
I just missed you today.
and you were lucky, 'cause I'm a good shot.
soon, everyone will know. - Know what?
what it means to suffer.
my dad used to take me here.
night after night.
he said it was gonna be fun, but it wasn't.
you and me, Kev. - Kevin?
you and me. We're in this together.
I still come here sometimes. I don't even know why.
it's not like I'm ever going to make sense of this.
I thought I'd suffered enough.
then you guys came along.
Yeah, you're being paranoid.
nobody is trying to get you! Nobody is out to get you.
I never touched that kid!
I never touched him!
people who do that are sick. And I... I hate them!
and now everyone thinks I'm the thing.
I'm the one thing that I hate the most.
even my own brother thinks so. I see it in his face.
I... I believe you. I believe you, Kevin. I do.
if there's anything I can do to make this right...
all cars, 10-33. Wait for instructions.
10-33, what does that mean?
10-33? - Emergency.
it means emergency stand by.
Aha. 10-33.
I like it.
they'll all funnel through the... that door,
I'll be up there waiting. Yeah.
no, Kevin, that's not gonna work.
okay? E. T.F is gonna be all over this thing.
there are a lot of guns coming.
I told you I'm a good shot.
no, I'm serious. I'm serious. You made your list.
I promise you not one of them is coming out today.
those officers are at the station, and they are not going anywhere.
9-1-1. What's your emergen...
don't worry. They're comin' for ya.
won't be long.
we already have eyes on the building. Two floors, silent entry.
assault teams will be stationed on the southeast - and northwest corners. - Hey.
we just picked up a signal from Oliver's cell phone.
same location. St. Augustus on Queen.
okay, Bailey, Callaghan, you'll be running this from the command bus. I want all cleared officers on this.
we don't know what we're walking into here, so let's keep our eyes open. That clear?
Yes, sir. - Everyone comes home today.
every single one of you. Nash, you're with Callaghan.
McNally, Collins, Swarek, you're staying put.
no discussion.
I know.
I don't think you should go. Steve, it's gonna be fine.
you know, you stay at the back, all right?
you go in last. You act like a coward.
okay, you know what? Cowardice is highly underrated, Traci.
the thing is, you would know that since you happen to be the toughest broad I know, and that's saying a lot, considering I grew up with Gail, you know.
how about I make you that dinner tonight?
I'd like that, but, uh, red wine for the little guy, right?
Yeah, something like that. Yeah? Careful.
see you soon.
have you called Holly? Excuse me?
look, I called my mom, Christian. Hell, I even talked to Denise.
I'm lucky that everyone else I care about is right here at this division.
Gail, I'm just saying...
call her.
Kevin? Hey, Kevin, listen to me, man.
it's not too late. You got...
you got time still. You got my radio. Just...
hit the button on the side and tell 'em that it's over.
sniper on the south side. Can't see anything.
nothing from the main entrance-way.
no movement inside. I want eyes inside the building.
copy that. Heading to the South end.
I mean, what do you think's gonna actually happen here?
it's just you and me, man. There is no E. T.F. I lied about that.
sorry to burst your bubble. I am not that important a guy.
okay.
Kevin, they're here! E. T.F. is here! I lied, man!
you got about two minutes!
he's alive.
Kevin, it's not too late.
I swear to God, I'll make this right for you.
if you didn't do it...
you're gonna have to put your gun down, man.
this is your only chance. Come out, come out.
it isn't worth it, my friend, I swear.
you can work this out. You can figure it out...
southwest door barricaded shut. Looks like some kind of pressure switch, pipe bomb.
same thing on our side. No entry at the southeast door.
only clear entryway is north door.
then we go through the front.
alpha, bravo, move to north side for immediate entry.
Roger that.
taking the west staircase. - Roger that. Taking the east.
no, no! Go back! Go back! There's a gun!
gun! Gun in the balcony!
west balcony clear!
center's clear. - East balcony clear!
got a rifle on the east balcony.
we're clear! Going in three.
Frankie? - Good to see you, brother.
Yeah, you should listen. - Get him outta here.
guy was right up there.
I thought he was gonna start shooting.
he was up on the balcony. - All right. All right.
I couldn't get ahold of her parents, but I called my dad. He's a doctor, so, you know, I figured we'd get a second opinion.
I... I explained everything to him, and he thinks that surgery is definitely her best option.
I can't let them cut her open again, man. Not now.
I know, but if we don't do this operation, she could be paralyzed or worse.
that could happen if they do operate.
but the doctor said it's far less likely.
she also said Chloe could heal on her own. So what, you wanna just do nothing?
you wanna just gamble that she's gonna be okay?
look, I don't need your permission here. I'm her husband.
I have the authority to make this call.
so that's it? This is what she'd want.
and if you knew her as well as you think you do, you'd know that.
I'm getting the doctor. She needs to have this operation.
it's not gonna happen.
Oliver's okay. They found him. He was at the church.
Where's Ford? Did they bring him in?
they didn't find Ford. - What?
he wasn't at the church.
I don't know. We got officers at his house, at the warehouse, at his brother's cabin.
he's not gonna go there.
he used it as his alibi last time, and it didn't add up then.
what do you mean? His brother said that they spent the weekend together.
but there's no evidence of it.
okay? I have a witness statement...
that says, "no, I did not see Kevin's van.
in fact, I didn't see any vehicles at all.
maybe neither one of them was there.
well, Abe said that they were, so why would he lie about that?
I don't know.
make an alibi for his brother?
what if I was wrong? What do you mean?
this whole time, what if I was looking at the wrong brother?
what are you doing? Going home.
the guy's still out there.
Yeah. I know.
you should stay here. Frank's right.
best place for you.
Oh. But not you, right? You're good.
you're bulletproof. - No.
Sam, you can't just leave. Yeah, I can, actually.
it's the only thing I can do.
the only good thing.
what do you mean, the only good thing you can do?
how's it a good thing to leave?
everybody's fine. Oliver's okay.
right. So stay. - I can't.
I can't.
I can't be here anymore... with you.
I... I don't understand.
I screwed it up. It's my fault.
I screwed it up over and over and over again.
Andy, I want you to be happy, more than anything in the world, more than anything I could ever want for myself.
and you are... with him.
and that means, uh...
I gotta go.
1504... this is Oliver's squad.
why is it here?
yeah? What's going on?
mcnally and I are in the parking lot.
we got Oliver's cruiser. - Swarek...
I told you to stay in the station. Yeah, I know.
listen, everyone on the list is here, and now Oliver's car is parked outside.
wait, wait. That can't be. We have not recovered his squad.
I think he's here. This whole thing is a diversion.
I think Kevin Ford is in the station.
what's going on?
we have reason to believe Kevin Ford is in the building, armed.
you need to secure this area. I've got four bodies in cells.
he's not after them. He's after us.
lock the doors and don't let anyone in you don't recognize.
ford might be wearing a police uniform.
I'll start clearing from here, then I'm getting my gun. You stay put.
I'm gonna clear the squad room, and I'll meet you in the middle.
celery. What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
is Oliver okay? - Oliver's fine.
I think Kevin Ford is in the building, dressed as a police officer.
come with me. Lock it down. Stay off the radio.
right. I got it.
what is your name?
Wendy. Okay, Wendy, come with me.
in here, please. Wh... what's happening?
stay here. No matter what happens, do not open the door unless you recognize the voice on the other side. I'll be right back.
say Kevin has a weekend blackout.
he doesn't have a solid alibi when the police come asking about the Hartley boy, so Abe offers to help.
builds himself an alibi in the process.
and he pins it all on his little brother.
abe's still in the station, right? - I think so.
Ford! No!
you gotta keep your head down. Stay down, stay down. No, no, no.
Sam, you gotta stay down, okay?
we got him. We did.
told you we would.
I mean, I didn't mean I told you so, but...
I know what you meant. - I gotta get up.
Sam, no, you gotta stay down, please. - I gotta get up.
Sam, please, you gotta relax, okay?
just stay down. It's gonna be fine.
move. Officer, you gotta move back.
no, I'm going.
C. T.A. S. 1. We have a 35-year-old male.
P. O. G. S.W. to the chest.
G. C.S.'s a 9. - Sam?
five minutes out. - I'm right here.
okay.
I'm just gonna... talk or something until we get there, 'cause I don't really know what else to do.
okay. So...
okay, but not you. Okay? Save every breath.
good plan.
it is, actually. It's an excellent plan.
you're gonna lie there, and you're gonna listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
it was just, you know, a normal night, and we were lying in bed. And...
my stomach was hurting from laughing 'cause you were teasing me about something.
I don't remember what.
I must have fallen asleep or something, because...
all of a sudden I was having this...
this really terrible dream.
and I couldn't stop crying. You know, I was crying and...
you weren't even really awake.
I remember you... you grabbed me.
I remember...
you were just holding me so tight, all of a sudden, you said, "I'm right here.
I'm gonna hold on to you, and I'm never gonna let you go.
right then...
I knew that I would never feel more loved...
or more known.
look, I know it's small. I know it's a really small moment.
it's... it's not even a good story. That was a pretty good story.
I love you.
I love you.
you're my story.
you.
officer, you're gonna have to move back.
so? He won't consent to the procedure.
okay, but maybe if we talk to him together...
no, you can't go in there.
what? - He's made his wishes clear, and now he's asked to be alone with his wife.
I'm sorry.
any news? Yeah. They're moving him into surgery.
look, Marlo...
everything that's happened here with you...
we need to deal with it.
Yeah. I got it.
you're gonna have to pack your things.
go home.
take your time.
is he alive? No.
no, he's not.
look, Abe, I'm gonna...
have to ask you about Marcus Hartley.
come on, Detective. It's over.
just help me clear up a few things.
the weekend that Marcus disappeared, where were you?
Hey, I came as soon as I heard. - Hey.
I'm really glad that you're here.
Steve, this is Holly. Chris, this is Holly.
Hey, how's it going? - Hey.
wake up, wake up. You gotta wake up.
come on, baby. You gotta stop waking me up.
you gotta wake up every hour.
it's been five minutes.
no, it hasn't, Dumbo.
eyes open.
Hey, what, uh, okay. Is it, uh...
what? Is everything all right?
okay, did we get him? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got him.
yeah? - You got him, yeah.
okay, good. Good. Yeah. So everything...
everything's fine. - Yeah, everything's fine.
okay.
good.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
thank you. Hey, doc, doc, can we go in? Can we see him?
not yet. I'm sorry.
doc. Please?
fine. One of you.
one person. - Right here.
it's okay. - Go.
go. It's fine.
Yeah, patient's tachy. Still unresponsive.
crossmatch 4 units of P. R.B. C.S, 10 units of platelets.
8 units of F. F.P.
where is it? - Suspect is armed and dangerous.
his name... Kevin Michael Ford. - All your cars have them.
42 years old. - Where is it?
currently resides at 30 Furlough Street.
wanted for the shooting of Officer Chloe Price.
okay.
okay. Here we go.
this is gonna be good.
no.
seriously. This is going to be good.
all right. When was the last time - you saw Kevin Ford? - Two weeks ago.
the night before his neighbor beat him up.
and you have not seen him since? Not today? Not yesterday?
you haven't driven by his house or checked up on him at the hospital?
Sam, I said I haven't seen him.
Hey, what's up? - You're not gonna like it.
I can't stand it when you open with that.
don't open with that. - McNally?
hit me.
I'm in Marlo's basement. It's all Kevin Ford.
maps, photographs, notes, charts. It's...
it's crazy.
Andy she must have been following this guy for weeks.
look, no one's seen it yet.
I'm still waiting on Oliver. - Okay.
just keep me posted.
what?
Marlo, I think we need to talk about what's in your basement.
this is 1527. I'm still waiting on backup.
1504, what's your 20?
1504, almost there.
you okay? Yeah. Yeah I'm... I'm fine.
good. See you soon.
thank you. - Right on.
listen, Wes, there's something I need to tell you.
Chloe and I are, um... seeing each other.
why didn't you say so?
well, 'cause, you know, this whole thing caught me off guard.
I didn't know about you.
and I didn't know she'd been married.
not sure if that says more about - my relationship with her or yours. - Yeah. Me neither.
is it serious... you and her?
Yeah. - You had to think about it. You sure?
Yeah, because this is weird. Okay?
I don't even know you. And... and... and... and...
you're... you're asking me if I'm serious...
if... about... - My wife.
exactly. So, yes, Wes, I'm very into your wife.
your wife and I are going steady.
you make her happy?
I think so.
you had to think about it again. - Well, you're impatient.
I'm just trying to gauge what I'm up against.
what's happening? - Ford's lawyer just got here.
what's that mean? It's the usual, you know, you guys got it all wrong.
my client's a great guy, he loves puppies. He's innocent.
my client is out of his mind.
uh, former client, I should say.
Kevin called me into the hospital, said he wanted to file a lawsuit against the police.
he claimed that you guys were persecuting him, following him, framing him for crimes he didn't commit.
but when I told him that it would take a few weeks to look at the facts, he attacked me.
it took two nurses to get him off me.
why didn't you report it?
I was afraid he was going to come after me.
look, I have worked with Kevin for a while, and he's always been a bit of a loner.
but this was insane. - What did the hospital say?
they said he had suffered a traumatic brain injury.
erratic behavior, paranoia, trouble with impulse control.
so he thinks he's being persecuted by the police.
now anyone in particular? - Yeah. 15 division.
he said he wasn't gonna stop until it was over.
okay, listen up.
as most of you know, we believe our shooter to be one Kevin Ford, 42 years old, Caucasian male, suffering from a severe traumatic brain injury.
former suspect in a missing child investigation.
we got officers at his workplace, and a B. O.L. O. out on his van.
uniforms are at Ford's house. It's empty. He's not there.
all right. We'll get over and check it out.
his parents are deceased. We need to find his brother.
abe Ford, 50 years old, 673 Parkside Road.
peck, Diaz... bring him in. Keep it friendly.
we're on it. All right. The rest of you,
I want you out on patrol in pairs.
okay, we're looking for a white panel van. The plate number's on the handout.
and be careful out there. - Good to see you, officer. Glad you're safe.
Nick's at her house right now. - All right. We'll send forensics over.
Swarek, you good to take her statement? Yeah, yeah, we're good.
okay, we have to explain this to them. Explain what? There's nothing we can do.
they're going to find everything now.
take it easy. All right?
mom would kill me if anything happens to you. - Yeah. Please.
she wouldn't even notice.
don't worry, Detective. I got her back.
always have, always will.
Holly, hey.
Hey. - You said that already.
you know, it sounded familiar. I just wanted to see you.
you know, take ten minutes, lay eyes on you.
Oh. Okay, so that's how we're gonna do this.
Gail, we should probably get going.
just... just be careful, okay?
I will.
so everything in your house is now evidence.
I should have packed it up. Burned it.
I wasn't thinking straight. You know that.
look, the, uh, silver lining is that...
that you know more about this guy than anyone else.
okay, so let's start thinking about that.
what do you we know? - You heard from Oliver?
no. Why? - 'Cause he still hasn't shown up.
Nick can't reach him. Celery hasn't heard from him.
I just tried to call him three times, - and his cell phone is off. - What does dispatch say?
apparently he's been parked in the same location for the last 45 minutes. 3900 Lake Shore.
I'll be here.
this is 1519. There's no car here.
can you please repeat the location?
GPS on car 1504 still reads 3900 Lake Shore.
okay. Well there is no 3900 Lake Shore.
I mean, it's an empty lot. - Andy.
1519, we're trying to narrow it down.
we found it. We found the sender unit.
it's been taken out of the car.
sorry, go again. You found the car? - No, we found the box.
the car is missing.
there's no sign of Officer Shaw.
final act preparations.
he turned down the heat, paid his bills, even laid his suit out.
this was taped to his computer.
Yeah. It's a hit list.
last radio contact was 39 minutes ago.
Oliver said he was on his way here. So what, he never showed?
he did.
his unit locator pinged him at this address about an hour ago.
if he'd already been here, why did he say he was on his way?
okay, got it. The guys just found Ford's van around the corner.
what about Oliver's cell? There's no signal.
they got techs working on the van, uniforms are searching the park.
for what? A body?
what does that mean? - Detective...
there's something I think you need to see.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, you two...
look, as soon as we're done here, I want you back at the station.
you stay there until this is over.
what? - Why?
Frank, this is Oliver. We need to be in this.
Kevin Ford made a hit list, Sam, and you're on it.
so is McNally, so is Chloe, who's now in I. C.U.
so is Oliver, who's now missing.
so until further notice, you're both staying at the damn station.
what is this? Looks like Marlo was doing her research.
she's got copies of every file on Kevin Ford, every interview with him, about him.
it stretches back about three years. There's even a timeline.
why aren't these confidential files back at the station?
you want to tell me what's going on?
Marlo had a hunch. Clearly she was right.
excuse me?
Luke... she slipped up, but she's back on her meds. She's... she's better now.
meds for what?
meds for what? She's bipolar.
she had a manic episode... just a break.
so she ended up focusing all of her energy into Kevin Ford because she thinks that he killed the kid three years ago.
you both have been covering for her?
she was right. Okay, she was right.
look at where we are. Look at what he's doing. She was dead right about the guy.
Yeah.
box it up, bring it to the station. Maybe there's something we can use.
I'm not talking to you about this right now. We have an officer missing.
so how does this work? We wait for her to wake up, and then we duel?
guns or knives? How do you feel about pub trivia?
you must be miss price's husband.
can I have a word? - Uh, actually, I'm her husband.
Oh, okay. A... and you are?
boyfriend.
everything okay?
unfortunately, the latest C. T. shows a clot in her carotid artery, where we repaired the gunshot wound. And I think we should remove it.
we've got a window of opportunity here, and if we leave it,
I'm concerned that she could suffer a stroke, neurological damage, possibly even paralysis. So... what are we waiting for?
as with every procedure, there are risks, and you should know what they are.
risks? What kind of risks?
we'll need to clamp off the damaged artery to get to the clot.
problem is she has swelling on the other side.
if that swelling increases while we're operating, there's a possibility that she might not get sufficient circulation, which could lead to brain death.
how much of a possibility? - I'd say it's unlikely.
but given her condition, it's hard to quantify.
what are the other options? We monitor the situation.
treat her with anticoagulants, and maybe the clot dissipates naturally.
it's a lot to process. Does she have other family you should talk to?
Yeah. Um... I'll try calling them again. But, doctor, what do you think we should do? I think I should operate.
and soon.
I'm just making myself useful. Keeping busy.
um... I was gonna go get some decent bread, but the guy at the front...
I was gonna go to the health food store, and he wouldn't let me leave. So I don't know.
I figure Oliver's going to be really - hungry when he gets back. - Celery, Oliver is missing.
we're doing everything we can to find him. I promise we are gonna bring him back.
Oh, God. Okay.
um, what can I do?
nothing. Just sit tight.
we're gonna find him. - Okay. Thanks.
I gotta go.
okay, Collins, Swarek, McNally...
you will remain at the station until further notice.
the rest of you, we're looking for Oliver's squad.
1504. Right now it's our only lead.
detective... we've got Kevin Ford's brother in interview one.
great. Thanks. Nash.
Callaghan, if we're going to make sense of these notes, we need to bring Marlo into this.
that's up to you, Detective.
at this point, what does it matter?
all right. Collins, - do you want to get Marlo in here, please? - All right.
what? He's out there somewhere.
and we can't even leave the station.
okay. We don't need to leave, all right? We need to use our heads.
Andy, we work together, we will find him 'cause that's what we do.
honestly, I... I haven't seen him in over a week.
is there another place that he might go... another address? Another workspace?
I mean, I saw him in the hospital.
he was losing it. He was like a different person.
but...
you know, you guys haven't exactly made it easy on him.
all right? You've hauled him in here over and over again, accused him of... of... of abducting children... of... of hurting children.
of course he's upset. Upset?
abe, your brother's shooting police officers.
I don't know where he is. I swear to God, I don't know.
I don't even want to see him again. I told him that in the hospital.
you told him what? - I cut him off.
I thought he was going to kill me right there.
Kevin, right?
you want to talk about this?
cause me... I'd kind of like to talk about this.
I'm a little confused here.
confusing getting hit in the head, huh?
everything goes a little... - you know.
it's gonna be good.
okay. Kevin, what are you doing?
settin' the scene. Settin' the trap.
I know you.
you were there the day I got attacked. - Yes. Yeah, I was...
I arrested the guy that assaulted you.
I was in your house. I called E. M.S. for you.
funny, considering - you put him up to it. - What?
Yeah, I know what's going on.
look, I saw what she did. That bitch has it out for me.
and you're part of it. So, don't.
just don't.
Oliver Shaw. You're on my list.
okay. All right. List.
Kevin, what list are you talking about? Already got one of them.
uh, what's her name? Price?
the chickie with the... the brown hair.
I only wish I got both of them. That would have been sweet.
uh, but you know... You win some, lose some.
I don't want to talk anymore.
that officer that you shot... she's still alive.
I said I don't want to... - Chloe Price is still alive.
I don't want to talk anymore! - You got a chance to get out of this.
you got a chance! - Shut up!
you have a chance to... - Get up!
nobody listens to me!
Gail, we're gonna find him.
that's what people kept saying to me when Christian was missing.
I know they were just trying to make me feel better, but it worked. So, Gail, we're...
we're gonna find him. That's all I want.
okay, we find Oliver.
he makes a very dumb joke.
Chloe gets out of the hospital. I make fun of her to her face.
we go back to the Penny.
we stiff Dov the bill.
I mean, that's life as it was. That's life as it should be.
Oh, my God, we've had it very, very easy.
I don't know.
last year was pretty rough. - Honestly, that... feels like it happened to somebody else.
I mean, I...
I don't really feel anything for months, but...
I got mean. Messed things up.
it seems very... stupid right now.
I don't know. Maybe... maybe that's part of the point.
part of the... plan.
thank you, Confucius.
I'm just saying, when it's dark enough, you can see the stars.
three years ago, Marcus Hartley went missing.
Kevin Ford was the number one suspect.
his alibi... it just didn't add up.
they never found the boy... - Marlo. Marlo, right now we just need to find Ford, okay?
y... I know. I...
look, you've been tracking this guy for weeks.
let's just... let's just talk it through, see if we can figure this out, okay?
okay, uh, the 11th? I mean, work. Work.
there was a drop-off at the store, and then she was in for the rest of the night.
same for the 12th, same for the 13th.
the 14th is Saturday. Why do I know that?
well, there's nothing until 3: 00 P. M. the next day.
well, let's check it anyway. - It's not gonna have anything.
why... what? Why?
because you went away that weekend.
remember? Chicago.
you went to that place downtown. You went to the restaurant where you got served by blind people.
relax. I wasn't spying on you.
Oliver told me.
14th... let's, uh, let's check it, okay?
fine.
it's just a parking ticket.
3550 Queen. - Where is that?
Mm. Queen and Shannon, maybe? Yeah.
wait, wait, wait, there's two more.
3552 Queen. 3598 Queen.
Marlo, uh, Queen and Shannon... what are we talking about?
you filed a couple of parking tickets all around the same address?
I... I don't know.
I would have taken them off his van and just filed them by date.
okay. Queen and Shannon.
there's a, uh, camera store, post office...
a couple of restaurants... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
there's four more tickets in the system.
all of them unpaid, in the same intersection.
Sam, they're all from this week.
queen and Shannon... mean anything to you?
we used to live around there when we were kids.
my dad worked in the area, so... Where did he work?
he worked security at one of the churches on Queen.
a rough area back then, so they needed someone in there at night.
but that was years ago, before, uh, before he started his business.
is there any reason your brother would go back there?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess there's about a million reasons... - Abe.
please.
why would he go back to the church?
my dad wasn't, uh, the best father.
you know?
wasn't a nice man.
what do you mean? He used to t...
he used to take one of us with him...
to work two or three times a week.
uh, and we'd come home in the morning, and then we'd have...
breakfast and every time, it was like it didn't...
it didn't happen. You know, but...
it does. It...
it happens.
it's how you deal with it that... that... that matters you know, and... and...
and, uh, and so I, you know, I pulled myself together.
but Kevin...
he fell apart. By the time he was 14, he was drinking every night.
mm, blacking out every weekend. And... and... and...
he's... he was a mess.
Hey. We got our connection to the church.
it turns out their father was abusive to them both. The church is where it happened.
well, let's go. Let's check it out. - You're not going anywhere.
okay, we do this with E. T.F. - I'll call Bailey.
all units, 10-33.
what are you doing, Kevin? You know what I'm doing.
I just missed you today.
and you were lucky, 'cause I'm a good shot.
soon, everyone will know. - Know what?
what it means to suffer.
my dad used to take me here.
night after night.
he said it was gonna be fun, but it wasn't.
you and me, Kev. - Kevin?
you and me. We're in this together.
I still come here sometimes. I don't even know why.
it's not like I'm ever going to make sense of this.
I thought I'd suffered enough.
then you guys came along.
Yeah, you're being paranoid.
nobody is trying to get you! Nobody is out to get you.
I never touched that kid!
I never touched him!
people who do that are sick. And I... I hate them!
and now everyone thinks I'm the thing.
I'm the one thing that I hate the most.
even my own brother thinks so. I see it in his face.
I... I believe you. I believe you, Kevin. I do.
if there's anything I can do to make this right...
all cars, 10-33. Wait for instructions.
10-33, what does that mean?
10-33? - Emergency.
it means emergency stand by.
Aha. 10-33.
I like it.
they'll all funnel through the... that door,
I'll be up there waiting. Yeah.
no, Kevin, that's not gonna work.
okay? E. T.F is gonna be all over this thing.
there are a lot of guns coming.
I told you I'm a good shot.
no, I'm serious. I'm serious. You made your list.
I promise you not one of them is coming out today.
those officers are at the station, and they are not going anywhere.
9-1-1. What's your emergen...
don't worry. They're comin' for ya.
won't be long.
we already have eyes on the building. Two floors, silent entry.
assault teams will be stationed on the southeast - and northwest corners. - Hey.
we just picked up a signal from Oliver's cell phone.
same location. St. Augustus on Queen.
okay, Bailey, Callaghan, you'll be running this from the command bus. I want all cleared officers on this.
we don't know what we're walking into here, so let's keep our eyes open. That clear?
Yes, sir. - Everyone comes home today.
every single one of you. Nash, you're with Callaghan.
McNally, Collins, Swarek, you're staying put.
no discussion.
I know.
I don't think you should go. Steve, it's gonna be fine.
you know, you stay at the back, all right?
you go in last. You act like a coward.
okay, you know what? Cowardice is highly underrated, Traci.
the thing is, you would know that since you happen to be the toughest broad I know, and that's saying a lot, considering I grew up with Gail, you know.
how about I make you that dinner tonight?
I'd like that, but, uh, red wine for the little guy, right?
Yeah, something like that. Yeah? Careful.
see you soon.
have you called Holly? Excuse me?
look, I called my mom, Christian. Hell, I even talked to Denise.
I'm lucky that everyone else I care about is right here at this division.
Gail, I'm just saying...
call her.
Kevin? Hey, Kevin, listen to me, man.
it's not too late. You got...
you got time still. You got my radio. Just...
hit the button on the side and tell 'em that it's over.
sniper on the south side. Can't see anything.
nothing from the main entrance-way.
no movement inside. I want eyes inside the building.
copy that. Heading to the South end.
I mean, what do you think's gonna actually happen here?
it's just you and me, man. There is no E. T.F. I lied about that.
sorry to burst your bubble. I am not that important a guy.
okay.
Kevin, they're here! E. T.F. is here! I lied, man!
you got about two minutes!
he's alive.
Kevin, it's not too late.
I swear to God, I'll make this right for you.
if you didn't do it...
you're gonna have to put your gun down, man.
this is your only chance. Come out, come out.
it isn't worth it, my friend, I swear.
you can work this out. You can figure it out...
southwest door barricaded shut. Looks like some kind of pressure switch, pipe bomb.
same thing on our side. No entry at the southeast door.
only clear entryway is north door.
then we go through the front.
alpha, bravo, move to north side for immediate entry.
Roger that.
taking the west staircase. - Roger that. Taking the east.
no, no! Go back! Go back! There's a gun!
gun! Gun in the balcony!
west balcony clear!
center's clear. - East balcony clear!
got a rifle on the east balcony.
we're clear! Going in three.
Frankie? - Good to see you, brother.
Yeah, you should listen. - Get him outta here.
guy was right up there.
I thought he was gonna start shooting.
he was up on the balcony. - All right. All right.
I couldn't get ahold of her parents, but I called my dad. He's a doctor, so, you know, I figured we'd get a second opinion.
I... I explained everything to him, and he thinks that surgery is definitely her best option.
I can't let them cut her open again, man. Not now.
I know, but if we don't do this operation, she could be paralyzed or worse.
that could happen if they do operate.
but the doctor said it's far less likely.
she also said Chloe could heal on her own. So what, you wanna just do nothing?
you wanna just gamble that she's gonna be okay?
look, I don't need your permission here. I'm her husband.
I have the authority to make this call.
so that's it? This is what she'd want.
and if you knew her as well as you think you do, you'd know that.
I'm getting the doctor. She needs to have this operation.
it's not gonna happen.
Oliver's okay. They found him. He was at the church.
Where's Ford? Did they bring him in?
they didn't find Ford. - What?
he wasn't at the church.
I don't know. We got officers at his house, at the warehouse, at his brother's cabin.
he's not gonna go there.
he used it as his alibi last time, and it didn't add up then.
what do you mean? His brother said that they spent the weekend together.
but there's no evidence of it.
okay? I have a witness statement...
that says, "no, I did not see Kevin's van.
in fact, I didn't see any vehicles at all.
maybe neither one of them was there.
well, Abe said that they were, so why would he lie about that?
I don't know.
make an alibi for his brother?
what if I was wrong? What do you mean?
this whole time, what if I was looking at the wrong brother?
what are you doing? Going home.
the guy's still out there.
Yeah. I know.
you should stay here. Frank's right.
best place for you.
Oh. But not you, right? You're good.
you're bulletproof. - No.
Sam, you can't just leave. Yeah, I can, actually.
it's the only thing I can do.
the only good thing.
what do you mean, the only good thing you can do?
how's it a good thing to leave?
everybody's fine. Oliver's okay.
right. So stay. - I can't.
I can't.
I can't be here anymore... with you.
I... I don't understand.
I screwed it up. It's my fault.
I screwed it up over and over and over again.
Andy, I want you to be happy, more than anything in the world, more than anything I could ever want for myself.
and you are... with him.
and that means, uh...
I gotta go.
1504... this is Oliver's squad.
why is it here?
yeah? What's going on?
mcnally and I are in the parking lot.
we got Oliver's cruiser. - Swarek...
I told you to stay in the station. Yeah, I know.
listen, everyone on the list is here, and now Oliver's car is parked outside.
wait, wait. That can't be. We have not recovered his squad.
I think he's here. This whole thing is a diversion.
I think Kevin Ford is in the station.
what's going on?
we have reason to believe Kevin Ford is in the building, armed.
you need to secure this area. I've got four bodies in cells.
he's not after them. He's after us.
lock the doors and don't let anyone in you don't recognize.
ford might be wearing a police uniform.
I'll start clearing from here, then I'm getting my gun. You stay put.
I'm gonna clear the squad room, and I'll meet you in the middle.
celery. What are you doing here?
I'm on my way to the hospital.
is Oliver okay? - Oliver's fine.
I think Kevin Ford is in the building, dressed as a police officer.
come with me. Lock it down. Stay off the radio.
right. I got it.
what is your name?
Wendy. Okay, Wendy, come with me.
in here, please. Wh... what's happening?
stay here. No matter what happens, do not open the door unless you recognize the voice on the other side. I'll be right back.
say Kevin has a weekend blackout.
he doesn't have a solid alibi when the police come asking about the Hartley boy, so Abe offers to help.
builds himself an alibi in the process.
and he pins it all on his little brother.
abe's still in the station, right? - I think so.
Ford! No!
you gotta keep your head down. Stay down, stay down. No, no, no.
Sam, you gotta stay down, okay?
we got him. We did.
told you we would.
I mean, I didn't mean I told you so, but...
I know what you meant. - I gotta get up.
Sam, no, you gotta stay down, please. - I gotta get up.
Sam, please, you gotta relax, okay?
just stay down. It's gonna be fine.
move. Officer, you gotta move back.
no, I'm going.
C. T.A. S. 1. We have a 35-year-old male.
P. O. G. S.W. to the chest.
G. C.S.'s a 9. - Sam?
five minutes out. - I'm right here.
okay.
I'm just gonna... talk or something until we get there, 'cause I don't really know what else to do.
okay. So...
okay, but not you. Okay? Save every breath.
good plan.
it is, actually. It's an excellent plan.
you're gonna lie there, and you're gonna listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you a story.
it was just, you know, a normal night, and we were lying in bed. And...
my stomach was hurting from laughing 'cause you were teasing me about something.
I don't remember what.
I must have fallen asleep or something, because...
all of a sudden I was having this...
this really terrible dream.
and I couldn't stop crying. You know, I was crying and...
you weren't even really awake.
I remember you... you grabbed me.
I remember...
you were just holding me so tight, all of a sudden, you said, "I'm right here.
I'm gonna hold on to you, and I'm never gonna let you go.
right then...
I knew that I would never feel more loved...
or more known.
look, I know it's small. I know it's a really small moment.
it's... it's not even a good story. That was a pretty good story.
I love you.
I love you.
you're my story.
you.
officer, you're gonna have to move back.
so? He won't consent to the procedure.
okay, but maybe if we talk to him together...
no, you can't go in there.
what? - He's made his wishes clear, and now he's asked to be alone with his wife.
I'm sorry.
any news? Yeah. They're moving him into surgery.
look, Marlo...
everything that's happened here with you...
we need to deal with it.
Yeah. I got it.
you're gonna have to pack your things.
go home.
take your time.
is he alive? No.
no, he's not.
look, Abe, I'm gonna...
have to ask you about Marcus Hartley.
come on, Detective. It's over.
just help me clear up a few things.
the weekend that Marcus disappeared, where were you?
Hey, I came as soon as I heard. - Hey.
I'm really glad that you're here.
Steve, this is Holly. Chris, this is Holly.
Hey, how's it going? - Hey.
wake up, wake up. You gotta wake up.
come on, baby. You gotta stop waking me up.
you gotta wake up every hour.
it's been five minutes.
no, it hasn't, Dumbo.
eyes open.
Hey, what, uh, okay. Is it, uh...
what? Is everything all right?
okay, did we get him? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got him.
yeah? - You got him, yeah.
okay, good. Good. Yeah. So everything...
everything's fine. - Yeah, everything's fine.
okay.
good.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
thank you. Hey, doc, doc, can we go in? Can we see him?
not yet. I'm sorry.
doc. Please?
fine. One of you.
one person. - Right here.
it's okay. - Go.
go. It's fine.
Yeah, patient's tachy. Still unresponsive.
crossmatch 4 units of P. R.B. C.S, 10 units of platelets.
8 units of F. F.P.
we want you for train robbery and murder of the engineer.
get your hands on top of your heads.
you bastards.
you bastards.
rooster J. Cogburn, step forward.
are you Rooster J. Cogburn, Deputy Marshal for Western Arkansas?
you know I am.
a deputy who shoots and kills 64 suspects in 8 years, is breaking the law, not upholding it.
let's get this straight, Judge. Only 60 of them died.
all were shot in the line of duty or in self defense or attempting to flee.
you have served this court for almost two lustrums.
you're a strong man and a brave man, Rooster.
and you have, at times, executed your duties faithfully.
but all too often you have acted with excessive zeal and...
what's a lustrum, Judge? - 5 years. Don't interrupt me.
pay attention to me. This is not just a formal reprimand.
investors go where the law protects them, not shoots them.
is that the kind of law my deputy got yesterday?
I was proud to tell his wife I shot his killers.
it seems you can't serve this court without breaking heads and spraying bullets. The West has changed but you haven't.
I want your badge. - They don't know these new-fangled laws out there.
they're still shooting in the same direction, at me.
your badge, Cogburn.
you let yourself go. Look at your belly! You can't even close your coat.
you drink too much. - I ain't had a drink since breakfast.
and I only wear this coat in your court.
it was good enough when you needed me.
you've gone to seed, Rooster. Next case.
lieutenant, road's out ahead. Rock slide.
can we get around it? - No, sir.
but there's a shallow down river to take the wagon across.
column right, ho.
breed, we can't move nitro over those logs.
it's just dead wood, sir. It's easy to move.
Chipley, Grimm, dismount. Start moving those logs.
Rawlins! Bryant! Get the ropes. Help him.
the war is over. The US Cavalry lost again.
just like I told you.
give me my money.
don't you trust me? - Pay up, Hawk, or try takin' the gold without me.
don't tempt me. Any fool can blow nitro.
the last fool who thought that blowed himself up.
alright, move. Fast.
we got four days' hard ridin' and that gold shipment won't wait.
gone to seed, have I?
gone to seed! A man does his job, defends The Code, and what does he get?
disgrace and abuse. - Judge say, you abuse justice.
I abuse justice? There ain't no justice in the West no more.
men with sand in their craw, pushed aside by duded-up Yankee lawyers who won spellin' bees back home.
that ain't St. Louis beer. - Kansas City.
well, I don't like it.
neither does Sterling. Too sweet, ain't it, General?
well, give me my jug. - Judge Parker say lock it up.
who's payin' the rent here, him or me?
you can't lock up a man's whiskey. I'll give you one minute to get my...
don't shoot. I'll get it for you.
don't shoot. Until you've heard what I say.
you have said enough, Judge. None of it to my credit nor liking.
may I take a drink with you and General Sterling?
if you don't mind such seedy company.
rooster, you were my best Marshal. You could be again.
that account is long overdrawn, Judge.
old friend, let's let bygones be bygones.
I have an important assignment for you. - You seem to forget, Judge.
you hung up my guns, remember?
I am retired, relieved, and rejoicing. "l painted her, I painted her...
chen Lee, turn off the light.
no doubt you've heard of Hawk's latest outrage.
the Army believe he took the nitro for another robbery. Time's short.
you know the territory and the scout that set up the ambush.
breed? He run with Hawk now?
he's the best scout I ever had. Good friend, too.
he never done a wrong thing till he killed that Wells Fargo agent and run away with the payroll.
we need a man with grit, Cogburn. The government'll be mighty grateful.
how grateful?
for the return of the dynamite, 500 dollars. For Hawk, 1, 500.
now, that is information more to my liking. - I thought so.
I want him alive. I want him to answer to me, not you.
then we'll see about your badge. - I'll charge my retirement rate:
double salary, double expenses. Can you afford me?
rates noted and accepted.
a group of my deputies will act as your posse. But it'll take a while.
take a while? It'll take a miracle. Them lily-livered lawbrokers won't risk their necks, or you wouldn't be here. - You'll need this.
do the job, and it's yours again, permanent.
well, it goes against my grain. I'll ride at first light.
drunken cat.
that's right. In spite of the fact that you locked up our whiskey.
tell them deputies to meet me at Bagby's.
if you can find any.
see who they have to come to when they got a real job to do?
the old rat killer. Probably got another lustrum in me.
what is lustrum?
5 years, you Chinaman.
you people come here and we help you. You won't even learn our language.
maybe you're right.
here you are, sweet lady. How're you doing little darling?
go ahead. Hurry. As fast as you can.
wolf. Watch. Go.
they're settlers passin' through. - I know.
come, child.
welcome to Fort Ruby. I am Reverend George Goodnight and this is my daughter, Eula.
we offer you the hospitality of our settlement.
we are God's servants here.
and we must ask you not to sell ardent spirits or guns to the Indians.
civil law and God's law forbid it.
this is the law we go by, Sister.
so don't waste your preachin' tryin' to convert us.
please do not strip these people of their dignity with liquor and your worldly ways. We beg you.
this is for your collecting plate.
now, will you leave us be? We're gonna camp here, rest our horses and take our pleasures, with no more preachin' from God's servants.
a brand from the burning. - What's that you say?
our work, sir, is to pluck brands from the burning.
if you don't want to be plucked, then at least show us courtesy.
I do believe you're better at cluckin' than at pluckin'.
you're an unpleasant sort of fellow.
I'm the boldest sinner on the Arkansas River. People remember me.
only evil can come of your presence. Temptation is the Devil's spawn.
you callin' the Devil, Mister? - You do the Devil's work.
I'd shoot a man of the cloth or a lady. So don't provoke me.
I'm not afraid. I wear God's armor. I do not fear what man can do to me.
I do not fear a skunk. I simply do not care for his odor.
I'm warnin' you.
you have ridden the Hoot-Owl Trail and tasted the fruits of evil.
but justice will catch up with you to demand payment.
the Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
he made me to lie down in green pastures.
he lead me beside still waters. He restore my soul.
he lead me in the paths of righteousness in His name.
yea, though I walk through the valley of death, I fear no evil, for Thou art with me.
I've had enough Sunday school. Out of my sight, both of you.
thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
my cup runneth over.
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me in all my days.
and I will dwell in the house...
she put the fear of God into you, Hawk?
rooster, welcome. - Bagby. - Good to have you back.
huntin' trip? - You might say. Big game.
the Hawk. You seen him? - He went through here yesterday.
with a wagonload of heavy cargo. Had nine men with him.
which way'd they go? - Fort Ruby way.
the Winding Stair Mountains. Took the trail out of Webber's Falls.
fort Ruby? Last time I heard of that it was just a memory.
there's still a settlement. Mostly Indians.
run by a Yankee preacher and his daughter.
judge Parker's promised me a posse. When it gets here, if it gets here, send it on after me. I ain't waitin'.
why don't you have some of Winona's catfish stew?
I'd love to, Winona, but the trail's hot.
if I had my druthers, I'd pull a cork and jaw with you. So long.
see you later.
give him a drink. He's thirsty. - There's gonna be trouble.
he's thirsty. You want it, do you? I want him to drink every drop.
come on, make him drink it.
no, father.
Jerry, hitch up the wagon.
out. Out into the fields.
Jerry, get it hitched.
quick, now. Let's go.
to the fields. Quickly.
and lie down. Hide. Lie down.
you are all nothing but beasts.
murderers. - Let go of my horses.
I warned you.
move that wagon out.
for Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
our fathers lie together, Wolf.
two decent men trying to help and understand each other.
and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it.
goodbye, dear friend.
goodbye, Father.
miss Eula.
go ahead, shoot. We're not armed.
seems there's been enough shootin' here, Ma'am.
I'm of a different brand than them that did it.
rooster J. Cogburn, US Marshal.
you're too late, lawman.
too late to stop 'em. But not to hang 'em. What happened?
last night a company of gunmen ravaged the settlement, killed my father and many Indians. - I'm sorry.
wolf's family was killed.
they will pay for it, son. I promise you that.
for those that take the sword must perish with the sword.
Matthew. 26: 52.
Oh. Yes, Ma'am.
I figure the leader is a lean, blue-eyed villain.
he looked like that. - That was Hawk, alright.
I'm trackin' him for the government in Washington City.
he stole some guns and nitro from 'em. Plans to rob a bank.
and will you stop him? - That's my intent.
my orders are to arrest him, take him back to Fort Smith for trial.
that's one hanging I will attend. But there are nine of them.
well, Ma'am, I got my Navy Colt, a Winchester and a packet full of cartridges.
and a prayer on your lips, I hope. You will have need of it.
and the government promised me a posse, which I figure will be long on promise and short on posse.
go with God, Marshal. - God, you and the boy, Ma'am.
I'm taking you to Bagby's trading post. You'll be safe there.
gather your belongings. - We're not going anywhere.
I must stay and continue my father's work.
I will be both preacher and teacher.
I admire your sand, Sister, but you should know this is no place for a woman alone.
I will look after myself, and I have done so all my life.
I won't allow it. - You have no say in the matter, sir.
I have a lot to say. As Marshal, I am responsible the citizens' safety.
you will pack and come quietly, or I'll arrest you and take you anyway.
to whom do you think you are talking, Marshal?
you is "to whom" I'm talking.
you are bigger than I am, but physically, that is all.
in this situation, that is enough. - You mean you will use brute force?
that is exactly what I mean.
Oh, yes. I will go. But not because of your threats.
saddle our horses, Wolf. We'll look for grangers to help us rebuild.
you have a lot of brass, Marshal.
you will have need of it before we're through.
she sings a loud tune.
to make sure the Good Lord hears me.
Yeah. Go saddle the horses, son.
they there? - Yeah.
you pushed your luck too far. Now we got Injuns after us, too.
we gotta risk it. We're going through. - Hold it.
when I signal, follow.
when I throw the stuff, move fast.
alright, Hawk.
bring it on down.
I'd say I earned my money today.
you did what I paid you for, that's all.
rooster. - Yeah, it's me...
and what's left of Fort Ruby. Take care of 'em, Bagby.
you know Miss Goodnight?
are you alright, Miss Goodnight? - I'm fine, thank you. Hello, Winona.
them deputies show up yet? - Not a sign of 'em.
I'll bet my drunken cat they ain't comin'. I ain't waitin' for 'em.
Bagby, that is a strong-minded woman.
be careful, or she'll end up owning your store and you workin' for her.
keep the faith, Ma'am. See you at the hangin'.
wolf, come with me.
protect yourself.
wolf, on my horse.
Bye-bye. Thank you.
Mr. Bagby, I'm purchasing this Winchester, the scabbard and shells.
thank you for your hospitality.
but, Miss Goodnight... - Goodbye, sir. God bless you.
marshal Cogburn.
alright, what is it?
we're riding with you. - You're riding nowhere with me.
we won't slow you down, sir. - Right, 'cause you ain't comin'.
we'll have to ride hard to overtake them. - We ain't goin'.
I ride hard and alone. I eat light and sleep on the ground.
understood. We should reach Cheyenne Springs by sundown.
breed. Hurry up.
hawk don't trust a hired gun at his back. - Just at his side.
not there, neither. Breed's not on our side. Breed's a whore.
hawk paid for his services. He'd sell us to the law if they paid better.
let's get movin'. We're fightin' time.
marshal Cogburn, just wait a minute, please.
I feel that you are angry with me.
you are an almighty trial. This is man's work, and dangerous.
for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
I will make sure of what my father's murderers reap.
you will make sure of nothing, sister. I will.
you do your crocheting or fingernail fixin', but stay out of my way.
just a minute, I'm not through.
it came to me at Bagby's that I must help pursue these men.
I cannot shirk it. You're a peace officer. I'm sure that you understand duty.
I dreamed that life was beauty. I woke and found that life was duty.
I don't suppose you know the poems of Ella Sturgis Hooper?
no, ma'am, and I ain't interested in hearing 'em. Forget your duty.
your own General Lee found it the most beautiful word.
what do you know about Lee?
that he was a good Christian and was whipped by Yankees.
if they ever give 'em the vote, God help us.
easy!
keep her over here. Slow.
speed it up.
we're sure takin' a chance with this nitro.
with broke backs. I'd rather go down shootin'.
the nitro. Support that nitro. - Get it under there.
Leroy, get back here.
get to prying here. We'll hold it.
get under it. Easy, easy.
wheel just popped. Put it back on. We'll be out of here in 10 minutes.
the axle's broke, Hawk. - Then fix it. Don't waste time.
the axle's broke, Hawk. It'll take till morning to fix it.
nothin' is keeping that gold from me.
nothin', you hear? Nothin'!
I'll ride with Breed to Goldstrike, he'll size up the bank, I'll plan.
if this nitro ain't in town by Friday, the game's over. - Hawk,
I'm gonna ride along with you. Gotta get to a Doc, before it's quits.
ride along, but don't hold me back. I ain't got time for no cripple.
we won't let you down, boss. - Don't. I ain't a good loser.
wolf, I got a hunch we're just a little way from trouble.
get up there and take a care look-see around.
I'll try and keep her ladyship occupied. - Yes, sir.
marshal Cogburn, we are here together and it is our obligation to be on good terms.
if we avoid remarks on the Civil War, there'll be no open hostility.
sister, why don't you step down. We'll give the horses' backs a rest.
get a little stretch.
why are you called Rooster? I never heard a man called that.
I guess in the old days, I was cocky, kind of a struttin' bird. - And have not changed much, as I see.
my tail feathers may droop a bit, and my wattles show, but I can still out-crow anything in the barnyard. - No doubt.
but can you outdo them?
if I couldn't, I wouldn't have much to crow about, would l?
it all depends on the barnyard.
is Rooster your Christian name?
I was baptized Reuben. But I ask you not to repeat that.
why not? It's a name to be proud of. Reuben led a great tribe in Israel.
well, it hit rock bottom with me.
I'm bound to ask you this. Is your name in the Lamb's Book of Life?
sister, are you licensed to preach?
what church do you belong to? They let women preach in it?
I'm not an exhorter, Mr. Cogburn.
service to others is my witness. I'm a teacher, and a journeyman nurse. Ayah, I can pull teeth.
I'm sorry that you don't like me.
I just don't like the way you talk.
how should I talk? Talking of such things is my business.
it isn't that, it's the way you talk. "Ayah, ayah." What is that business?
Oh, it's my Yankee speech that you find offensive? - I do.
I must try to remedy that.
paul tells us that we must be all things to all men.
I'll have to learn some vulgar southern expressions.
I'll learn to be lazy and slovenly.
I'll tell you something else that Paul said:
let your women be silent in church.
how do you know that passage?
judge Parker is partial to it. You're not the only one with a Bible.
he's got a big one. Make two or three of yours.
it's not the size that's important, but your knowledge of its contents.
repent ye therefore and be converted.
you have somethin' to say from that book for every occasion.
Ayah. It was my primer. In Boston children learn to read from it.
I figured you for a Yankee, but you look more like a prairie bird.
boney and tough.
as the only girl in a family of boys,
I grew up more strong and independent than a woman should be.
Amen, Sister. Amen.
marshal, you're praying.
that's the first step on the road to salvation.
this ain't no church social nor revival meeting.
so don't try to convert me, Sister, or I'll end up with a empty sack.
marshal Cogburn, a wagon and riders.
Ayah, that's the wagon.
I recognize that wagon.
just the way I figured.
you pay heed to every word I say, until this thing is over.
naturally, Marshal.
let's go.
wolf, you to take the horses and hide them. Signal from up there when they come.
when I yell "posse" shoot in the air, make a lot of noise.
don't shoot at them, you might hit the nitro.
you got that straight? Let me show you, there.
you pull that back, point it up in the air, squeeze it.
do you understand? - Yes, I think I understand.
get up behind that broken log. - Right.
don't forget, that thing's loaded. - No, no, I'll remember.
sister, they're comin'.
what's going on? Get these logs out of the road. - I wouldn't do that.
rooster J. Cogburn, US Marshal. My posse has got you surrounded.
keep your hand away from the rifles.
anybody can say he's a Marshal. Where's all your men?
you know who I am, you riff-raff, and what I'll do.
I'm arrestin' you all and takin' you and the wagon to Fort Smith.
clamp your hands on your heads and get off the horses.
he ain't got nobody with him. He's bluffin' - Hope so.
you're all talk.
we ain't afraid of you.
next one goes into that nitro.
OK, dismount, boys.
that's more like it.
damn your murderin' hides. Meet your maker.
posse.
he's got a posse. - Let's get out of here.
you alright, Sister?
wolf, give me a hand with the logs. - Yes, sir.
marshal, thank God you're safe.
wolf, that was a great shot. - But I didn't shoot.
you shot him across that nitro? You could have killed us all.
if I hadn't shot him, you'd be dead instead of him.
were you trying to talk him to death?
if that worked, you wouldn't need that rifle.
I'll to say a few words over the dead. Good or bad, they're God's own.
they look like they're past carin', but go ahead.
lord have mercy on us for what we did.
l am the resurrection and the life," sayeth the Lord.
he that believeth in me, though dead, yet shall he live.
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
the Lord gave and He taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
we brought nothing into this world and it is certain that we can take nothing out.
unto Almighty God I commend these souls.
hurry it up, Sister, or we'll be joinin' them.
for thine is the Kingdom, the power and glory forever. Amen.
earth to earth, ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
dust to dust. Get on the wagon.
my father's murderer was not among them.
there's a Federal bank at Goldstrike. Hawk's there settin' up the stealin'.
I'm gonna bait me a rat-trap. And this is the cheese.
be careful you do not end up as the cheese.
sister, your confidence in me is inspiring.
I' gonna take this wagon to Sulfur Bottom and wait for them.
spring my trap on my own ground. That's not what's worryin' me.
you gotta help me protect her, son. - Yes, we'll protect her. - Good boy.
how'd a blue-blooded lady like you ever learn to shoot like that?
my first beau taught me how to shoot and equitation.
Equitation? - Ayah. You know. Horseback riding.
I've been doin' that for 10 lustrums.
Lustrums?
50 years.
Ayah. I see. To continue, my first beau was a dashing young man. A bit simple.
I think my manner scared him off. He taught me to shoot well, don't you agree? - Fair.
how old are you?
shall we say, it has already struck midnight.
how much do you weigh? - My word!
I don't mind scrawny women. My first wife was nothing but bones.
I didn't know you were married. - Yeah, she left me.
rather like Jack Spratt and wife, only in reverse.
the Spratts had a very good arrangement, I must say.
do you get paid for every conversion? - No, it doesn't work like that.
no fees? - No fees.
and you haven't got your own money? - Very little. - I thought that.
are you scouting for a rich widow?
I guess you can't cook either. 'Course, that's just a guess.
it appears I don't measure up. That's a mercy.
you got more backbone than femaleness, that's a fact.
Yeah, Marshal, I would say that is a fact.
out here in the territories, we prize a dead shot more than a lady's charms.
then I've come to the right place.
so, men out West don't mind if a woman out-shoots, out-smarts them?
if they're quiet about it.
we value a spirited woman almost as much as a spirited horse.
almost as much, eh?
Yes, Ma'am. Almost as much.
not quite. But almost.
hawk.
hawk, I don't think I can make it.
leave him. We ain't got time for diggin'. Let the buzzards have him.
marshal Cogburn, I'm curious. What is it that you're doing?
I'm busy tryin' to follow Uncle Sam's regulations.
that gentleman'll have his fee sheets just and correct, or he won't pay.
you're recording expenditures?
somethin' like that. Without a deputy to help, it's the Devil's own work.
without any schoolin', you're up against it in this country, Sister.
perhaps I can help you. - Well, I'd be obliged.
now, these forms are ruled with places for entries.
but your handwriting wanders into places it should not go.
I'll rub out your chicken tracks and work them over.
what's this entry? "Important words with blue, 2 dollars.
that's the soldier boy that tipped me on Hawk and his gang.
and he charged his government for the information?
not exactly. I can't remember the details of every transaction.
travel rations for Miss Goodnight and Indian boy, Wolf, 3 dollars.
but we brought our own food.
they don't know that. - They may be smarter than you think.
from now on, you must have approximate dates...
alcohol on an empty stomach kills more men than outlaws' bullets.
you don't say.
my stomach ain't empty. It's full of corndodgers.
balls of hot water cornbread, made by Chen Lee, my friend.
must be near 50 in there. - Why are they called corndodgers?
dodgin' corn whiskey in my innards, I guess.
you'd be better off dodging it too. A drinking man is half a man.
you cannot give weight to the words of a drunkard.
don't tell me you stand in judgment of a man who pulls the cork sometimes?
I do. It's a weakness that indicates a lack of character.
you know more about the Lord and His Good Book than about men.
my good fortune. I know enough about men to steer clear of them.
I had no hankerin' to have one of my own. And no desire to produce more.
wolf.
Yes, sir? - She's frightening.
look. I got me a 22 pepperbox here.
this thing shoots 5 times, sometimes all at once.
it is called a Lady's Companion. That's what it'll be when I'm gone.
in Fort Smith, there is a sportin' lady named Big Faye.
she was shot twice with this thing, but she dressed out at 290, so none of the bullets found their way to the vitals.
but against ordinary people it gives good service. Protect Sister with it.
thank you, sir. I shall guard Miss Eula with my life.
it'll likely be the other way around.
but you take good care of her. She is somethin'.
you wait here for Dakota. - I could use a drink myself.
I only drink with friends.
good shot. You're hitting more than missing.
them I Ain't hittin', I ain't aimin' at.
if you're not careful, Hawk's men will hear and be looking for you.
if they ain't careful, they'll find me.
Hey, Wolf, chuck up two of them things.
your equitation teacher do that?
marshal Cogburn, we're ready to go.
shooting cornbread in a meadow is not taking us anywhere.
and my father's murderers ride free.
well, Sister, I was just celebratin' a little.
celebrating what?
bein' alive, Sister.
you're shooting your own food.
whiskey is making you silly. Why do people wish to be silly?
why do people wish to be sober?
life ain't a easy game. Won't hurt to make a fool of yourself sometimes.
Yes, sometimes. But not more often than not.
marshal Cogburn, you're in a sorry state.
you're unsteady, untidy, rank with the sweat and spirits.
did you forget cleanliness and abstinence are next to Godliness?
no, I ain't forgotten a woman's naggin' and schemin'.
you figure you can take my bottle and give me soap.
give me a Bible for my gun. Well, it ain't gonna work.
I am what I am. That's what I am.
wolf.
I'm fine.
I'll tell him.
you made good time. Where's the wagon?
that's why we came so soon. We lost the wagon.
a posse of Marshals ambushed us. They got Nose and Emmett.
whiskey.
you'd run from a jackrabbit.
rooster Cogburn ain't no jackrabbit.
Cogburn? Cogburn aced ya?
Yeah.
let's go.
you'll never take him, Hawk. - Yeah?
Yeah. I rode scout for him 3 years. And I know.
you take my money, and you wear my brand.
got it?
get your butts in the saddle. We're ridin'.
we'll make camp early. This is a likely spot.
is it safe to stop overnight, sir?
we got to rest the horses. Unhitch 'em.
anyway, I ain't worried about them roadrunners.
they'll be in Goldstrike lickin' their wounds, consortin' with lewd women. They'll start after us tomorrow.
boy, am I thirsty.
I'm gonna fetch some water.
drinkin' water.
washing water I'm a stranger to, and will leave you two to draw.
marshal Cogburn, I'm sorry if I offended you with my remarks regarding your personal habits.
I didn't realize you were such a sensitive nature.
my hide is tougher than boot leather.
but no man likes to be called high-smellin' and low-down.
Ayah, true. But unpleasant things are best said right out.
a sharp knife cuts quickest and hurts least.
and aught to be left in the scabbard.
you're a flash of lightning, Marshal. - No. I just follow the thunder.
well, I'll follow my own advice and retire to the stream to perform my ablution.
her...
her what?
her...
Hey, Sister.
be careful movin' out there.
everything that grows in this country'll either bite, stab or stick you.
will she be alright?
any varmint that crosses her path has met it's match.
you, too, Marshal?
she'll never get the best of me. You can bet on that,
do Indian women want to change a man too?
Yes. Miss Goodnight would be regarded as highly as a brave warrior.
no man wants to put his boots under a warrior's bed.
I heard some flappin' noise back in them trees.
soon as we get camp set up, let's go huntin'. Get us a turkey. Surprise Miss Eula with a good meal.
I would like that very much, sir. - Good.
here's where they way laid us, Hawk.
there was Marshals all around.
they can't be far. That wagon's too heavy to move fast.
and too risky to move by night.
breed. How many?
tracks are hard to read. Sure as Hell ain't no posse.
what? Hear that, you stupid bastards? He tricked you.
you listen to me, all of you.
I ain't goin' away without the nitro. I'll kill Rooster for it, and I'll kill each one of you, you show yellow again.
here, drink yourself some guts.
hello. The camp.
we must've hiked 10 miles tryin' to get a shot at a turk... turkey.
Bagbsy's gun pulls to the left as it fires, and the site is off a little. But it's a beauty.
son, we been outclassed. - We got a mixed bag, owl and 'possum.
put them in the pot. We'll have wilderness stew.
you shot 'em, skin 'em.
did you ever come up against Jesse James or Billy the Kid?
Naw, I never ran into them fellows.
did I ever tell how Lucky Ned Pepper and his gang chased me?
no. I'd like to hear about it. - Ayah. Tell us.
that was somethin'. They chased me till I got tired of it, then I just whirled my horse, Bo, around, took the reins in my teeth and rid right at them villains.
I was shootin' my pistol with one hand and my Winchester with the other.
never took aim. Just snap-shot and got 'em all.
marshal, are you sure you're not stretching the blanket a bit?
I was thinkin' you'd figure that way. So I told it gospel.
proof is, I'm here, their dead.
one sad thing that day.
lost old Bo.
marshal, would you like more to eat?
Naw, I don't think so. I'm full, but one thing I could stand:
I'd pay 3 dollars for a pickled buffalo tongue.
I'd have thought you'd had enough pickled tongue for one day.
no. But I've had enough tongue that's barbed and indigestible.
I know. It often is.
well, Sister, how do you stand on the sin of tobacco?
well, I know of no passage to prove it, but I'm certain that the Good Lord smokes fine cigars.
Hallelujah.
marshal, is your eye bothering you? I could sooth it with a poultice.
no, thanks, Ma'am. It's past help. - Was it a hunting accident, Marshal?
you might say that. Huntin' Yankees.
I lost it in the war, riding with Bill Anderson and Captain Quantrill.
times have sure changed. Now I'm workin' for a damned Yankee.
but you're still hunting, sir.
I guess I like Marshalin' better'n anything I've done since the war.
I like buffalo huntin', but them big shaggies is almost gone.
damn shame.
I was skinnin' buffalo at Yellow Horse Creek, Texas.
pay was great, but I couldn't stand that open country.
I'll bet there weren't 6 trees between there and Canada.
I love the freedom of the open prairies. You love your freedom too.
Yeah, yeah. I went off it once.
but my wife and l are travelin' different roads now.
she didn't like my friends, she didn't like me when I was myself.
my drinkin' picked up, she got a bellyful of it and left.
now I'm livin' happily with my cat, General Sterling Price, and my friend Chen Lee, the Chinaman. They let a man be.
be what, Marshal?
be his self. He don't have to change.
but change is progress. You're not too old to change. Life is a school.
well, teacher, don't start pressin' your dress for my graduation.
cause I intend to stay in my own low class, indefinitely.
may I have more 'possum stew? - Opossum. An American marsupial.
wolf, give me some of that owl meat.
it might make me smart.
a wise old owl sat on an oak, the more he heard, the less he spoke.
the less he spoke, the more he heard. Now, wasn't that a wise old bird.
I guess there's a lesson in that for me. For us both.
how many miles did we ride today? - About 20.
it feels like more than that. - Wait a minute. Maybe I can help.
that feels good.
I'll bet your backside hurts worse than anything.
Ayah, well, we can't do anything about that.
well, I reckon not.
better.
the Layin' on of the hands.
how do you happen to know that?
what I know might surprise you, Sister.
nothing about you would surprise me.
just a minute, Sister,
I'll put my lariat around your bed, then the night crawlers and snakes will respect it.
is it true, that they won't crawl over a rope?
I ain't gonna say it's true or it ain't true. But it's comfortin'.
thank you, Reuben.
the Good Book says, "Let not the sun go down on thy wrath.
I'm glad it didn't.
good night, Sister.
good night, Reuben. - Wolf, give me a hand.
good night, Ma'am. - Good night, Wolf.
this Gatling gun is a little heavy.
set this up for your protection, in case them cut-throats do come.
we'll still have an advantage.
a little chilly. I guess we'd better stand guard tonight over there across the creek.
you take the first watch, and I'll spell you around midnight.
you got the pepperbox? - Right here.
don't use it unless you have to. Any trouble, give that coyote howl and high-tail it back here to camp.
that big flat rock on the side is a good place for a look-out.
sir? - Yeah?
has there ever been an Indian Marshal?
not that I heard tell of. - That's what I'd like to be.
a man like you.
you're not aimin' your sites very high, son.
but if you'd like to follow in my tracks, I'd be proud to help you.
thank you, sir.
good night, son. - Good night, sir.
Reuben.
have you seen an enlarged picture of a drunkard's liver?
damnation.
even in their sleep?
good night, Miss Good night.
good night, Reuben.
bring him.
spread out.
marshal.
stay down. Where are ya, Wolf?
I got him, Rooster.
that you, Hawk? - You know it is.
you're interested in the wagon? - You let that boy go.
stay down.
I will let him go, when you give me back that wagon.
breed, you there? - I'm here, Rooster.
you alright? - I'm alright. You're the one with a little trouble.
I want that wagon. You ain't goin' nowhere with it.
give it to me, or the Indian boy dies.
then I'll blow up this wagon.
and hunt down every one of you and cut you throat to throat.
alright, I'll trade that damn wagon for the boy, if he ain't harmed.
show 'em the bait.
when they lower their guns, rush 'em. Shoot to kill.
alright, bring him across. We'll stand aside.
marshal, it's a trick. They're gonna kill you.
hold your fire.
nice work, boy. Here, Sister, give Wolf the rifle.
you may have the boy now, but nobody moves till we get what's ours.
I got a pretty good position here, and some mean deputies.
you're a liar, Rooster. You ain't got no posse.
well, I got a Gatling gun. And I got it set up.
you've got 2 minutes to run, or I'll fill you full of holes like a sieve.
you ain't got the know-how to use that gun.
deputy, show 'em.
ain't that the way it works, Hawk?
now, high-tail it before I forget my promise to bring you in alive.
that was good, Rooster. But the odds will change at sun-up.
spread out. When he moves it in the morning, we'll make our play.
wolf, did you see their horses? - Yes, sir, up there.
can you get back up there and spook 'em? - I can, sir. - Good.
you're risking the boy's life.
I'm countin' on your relationship with the Lord. Can you hitch a team?
Yes, I can.
I'll get there attention over there. Hitch the team and saddle the horses.
Yes.
hawk, you there? - Ready to deal, Rooster?
I'll give you a last chance to give yourself up.
wait till daylight. We'll see who's ready to give up.
I'll get you a fair trial and a fine hanging.
might even get you life at the Federal House in Detroit.
they'll teach you to read and write. 'Course the rest ain't so good.
get the horses.
good work, Wolf. You bought us some time.
wolf, gimme a hand.
you folks runnin' from somethin' or to somethin'? - Both.
are you goin' across? - We aim to use your raft.
10 cents for a horse and rider, wagon 1 dollar, 50 cents for extra weight.
show of money before passage.
I'm Rooster J. Cogburn, Federal Marshal.
the men I'm stalking are hot on my tail and I'm gonna need help.
give this woman and boy sanctuary.
if I wanted women and children I'd have my own.
they ain't nothin' but trouble. Don't saddle me with your discards.
you ain't very hospitable.
I ain't got an ounce of goodwill. I hate everybody.
I'm a cantankerous old man and I know it.
I like myself better'n anyone else. That's why I took this job.
watch that nitro. - What?
tell me if you want to cross. I can't stay out in this heat.
the sun is fryin' my brains.
I can only get this stuff down to Sulfur Bottom by river.
what do I do with you two? Too risky to leave you here.
maybe I can land you someplace before the shootin' starts.
old man? - Are you goin' across?
no.
we're goin' down river. We're loanin' the raft.
that ain't loanin', that's stealin'.
am I gonna have trouble? - Not a bit, as long as you got that.
I'm securin' this for the law.
I ain't got much use for the law. It ain't got use for me, neither.
is there a law says you can't help us? - Anything to get you out of here.
there you are.
do you know anything about rafts? There's rough water down river.
I can ride. Can't be much different.
you ain't no sailor. I can see that. Water is like a woman:
sly and fickle. You gotta watch it every minute.
you a sailor? - I was once. Shanghai McCoy's my name.
been around the Horn, sailed the 7 seas, seen everything, done everything, that's how I know people are rotten. I've seen 'em all.
you're wrong, old man.
we're made in God's image, and goodness is in us. Even in you.
Amazing'! I never took you for a Bible-thumper.
hold it. She is what she is 'cause she wants to be.
that's the way you take her. Like me.
you're wastin' your time preachin'. You too, Sister.
I'm a ship that can't be salvaged. - "With God, all things are possible.
you're shippin' out a strange crew, captain.
I'll match their mettle against most. - I'm glad it's your ship, not mine.
women can no more keep their mouths shut than a yellow-tailed catfish.
got to agree with you there.
we'll ride ahead and take 'em at the narrows. Breed.
you and Luke river-trail 'em.
join us at the narrows, just ahead of 'em.
hold your course.
keep the rudder amidships when you hit that white water.
nobody ever shot them rapids on a raft before.
you just take care of my horses, Commodore. I'll be back for 'em.
don't crack up my vessel on them rocks, you hear me?
it's so lovely here.
I wish we could sail right on down to the sea.
right now, Webber Falls would be more to my liking.
we'll get there tomorrow. With the Good Lord's help.
would you really have killed those men with the Gatling gun?
they believed I would. In a pinch a convincin' lie's as good as a posse.
tell me more about the outlaws and how you bested them.
if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I'll go have a little sleep.
I've had enough of your daring-do for one day.
you ever heard of Abilene Town? - No.
I was there lookin' for a bunco-steerer named 21-Jewel Slim.
that Abilene is the worst place I have ever saw.
it is a sink of crime.
I was standin' on Horse Thief Corner when Prairie Rose came down the street with nothin' on but her six-guns.
she was stark naked and painted... - Wolf!
stop poling and get some rest.
you've got to spell Marshal Cogburn tonight. - Yes, Ma'am.
what color was she painted, Reuben?
breed, ain't no love lost between you and Hawk, or him and me.
if you was willing to quit him now and join up with me.
I think we could take the raft and be rich men instead of dead ones.
you game?
maybe. What's your plan?
come on, I'll show you.
we lay the rope under the water, so they don't see it.
when they get up to it, it'll stretch tight and stop 'em.
old Rooster, he'll want to cut the rope, or stretch it up and float the raft underneath.
that's when I get a good shot at him, without a chance of blowing the nitro.
you kill the other two. We'll land the cargo later.
what makes you think this will work? - It'll work, partner.
now what? Take this tiller, Wolf.
what's holdin' us up?
rooster, cut it loose.
breed? - Yeah. Saved my life once.
now we're even. - Grateful to you.
hawk's waitin' for you down river. Can't help you there.
well, we'll be ready for him.
someone's comin'.
it's me, Hawk.
what the Hell you doin' here? Where's Luke?
dead. We shot it out with Rooster. Luke lost.
I said track him, not take him.
what happened? - Tried to stop the raft with a rope across the river.
rooster cut it and got away.
we gun-fought him, but...
hell, Hawk, he's just too good for us.
let me see your gun.
you don't want my gun.
Oh, yes I do.
you know,
breed here, he gun-fought old Rooster with just one bullet.
you're a liar, Breed.
I owed him one.
I wish this thing had a little more giddy-up to it.
I picked blackberries, Reuben. Would you like some?
no, not for me. I have to be careful. I can't just eat anything. Get colic.
course, my mouth is slickerin' for one thing:
chen Lee's corn bread, fried in a big ladle of coon meat grease.
Yes. Well, when we get to Fort Smith, I'd like to get Mr. Lee's recipe.
will we get back, Reuben?
the odds are the same. They ain't in our favor.
when you drop us off at Webber's Falls, and go after them, you will be careful, won't you?
wolf and I care about you, very much.
well, Ma'am...
I don't know much about thorough breds, horses or women.
them that I did know, I never liked.
they're too nervous and spooky. They scare me.
but you're one high-bred filly that don't.
I don't know what you're talkin' about half the time, but that don't matter.
bein' around you pleases me.
those are the nicest words ever said to me. Thank you, Reuben.
wolf,
I'll spell ya.
we got you now, Rooster.
throw your guns in the water, pull ashore, keep your hands high.
and don't try nothin', or you're dead.
that's a rattlesnake's warnin', Hawk. You squat-assassin.
your schemin' ain't gonna help now.
don't you rely on it, Hawk. Don't rely on it.
that'll keep their heads down.
there's one.
don't hit the nitro. Shoot wide. Force 'em into the bank.
them rapids'll get him now.
no. I will.
the Lord is with us.
so's that current.
if He owes you any favors, now's the time to collect.
get out of the way, Wolf.
alright, brace yourself.
God help us. - If He does, I'll give up drinkin'.
the gun.
it went over, we've lost the gun. - What the Hell can I do about it?
watch it there, Sister.
hold tight.
Oh, no!
you alright, Sister? - I don't know.
am I alright? How did we do it?
your friend must've been on the job.
I guess he must've.
my God!
marshal, look!
it's a showdown. - We did the best we could.
sister, I've finished every fight standin' up.
we'll finish this one, maybe not standing up, but we'll finish it.
wolf, get those lines loose.
have a care with that nitro. Easy does it.
ease them boxes into the water. Remember, it's nitroglycerin.
well, we'll see.
they never made it, Hawk.
Yeah, but the nitro did.
now.
hold your fire
marshal Cogburn is injured and dying.
take your dynamite, but give us safe passage.
sure, lady, we'll do that.
we'll just take our load, then we'll send you and your hero on.
straight to Hell. Come on.
now, Reuben.
payday. Come and get it, boys.
payday.
well, we won the battle, but I lost my job.
maybe not.
you see, Judge, the Lord could have struck down the Midianites and Amalekites easily. But He didn't do that.
he raised up Gideon to smite them. An ordinary man like the Marshal.
it's in the Book of Judges, Judge. - I know where it is, Madam.
very ingenious defense. It takes one's breath away.
but I do not believe the Lord has raised up Gideon at Fort Smith. No.
if he's raised up anything, I fear it's Rooster.
a willful, strutting old bird, who paid no attention to the US law.
but he did. I killed that criminal trash. Not Marshal Cogburn.
he wanted him hung, according to law, but I couldn't do that. - Silence.
my father's honor was at stake.
will you take Reuben's word, or mine?
Reuben?
well, in view of my past experience, with Reuben, I'll take yours.
get back on the rails.
this man may pull a cork now and then, but he's as straight as a string.
he's the best Marshal you have, worth more than you pay. - Reuben.
you are reinstated, and this court is recessed and dismissed.
reinstated.
congratulations, Marshal.
damn Chinaman.
one thing I'd like to get straight.
we both know the Lord brands lyin' a sin.
do you think He'll smile on you after them whoppers you told?
and if thy words stray from truth for the good of God's own, if thy intent be pure, thou shalt not be judged sinful.
beautiful quotation. What book? What chapter?
I confess, Reuben, it is my invention. I just made it up.
Hallelujah and jubilee! That is one quotation I'll remember.
and will you remember us, too?
longer than that quotation, Miss Eula.
we found 5 families who will homestead at Fort Ruby and help us re-settle it.
will you see us off at Texas Road? We join the wagon train there.
I will consider it a privilege, Ma'am.
well, Ma'am, this is where our trails part.
maybe they'll cross again.
that's something I'd like to drink to.
after that vow you took on the river? - "When a soul needs reviving, thou shalt reach for help.
book and chapter? - Rooster Cogburn, 1880.
will you join me, Ma'am?
maybe I will try just a little sip.
to someday.
someday.
goodbye, Marshal.
goodbye, son.
goodbye, Reuben.
watch your drinkin', Ma'am.
if you ever need of a one-eyed peace officer.
Reuben, I have to say it:
living with you has been an adventure any woman would relish for all time.
I look at you, with your burnt-out face, your big belly, your bear-like paws and shining eyes.
you're a credit to the male sex and I'm proud you're my friend.
damned if she didn't get the last word in again. Well...
are you a doctor? - He's an actor.
we're very popular with actors. Have I seen you in anything?
I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I? And then we did The Sandpiper.
he's joking. He was in Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross, and a lot of TV commercials.
that's where the money is. - And the artistic thrills, too.
seven, Diego.
the smallest apartment was a nine, but they've been broken into fours, fives and sixes.
Seven-E is a four, originally the back part of a 10.
the original dining room is its living room, another bedroom is the bedroom, and two servants' rooms together are a dining room or second bedroom.
do you have children? - We plan to.
we must oil that gate, Diego.
this way, please.
the previous tenant, Mrs Gardenia, died a few days ago, so nothing has been moved yet.
her son says the furniture could be had for asking.
did she die in the apartment? - No, no, no. In a hospital.
she'd been in a coma for weeks.
after you, please. - Thank you.
she was very old, and passed away without waking.
I'd be grateful to go that way myself when the time comes.
no, no, no. Not in the apartment, no.
she was chipper right to the end.
one of the first women lawyers in New York.
did a little gardening, too. - She was quite a woman.
closet. Oh, plenty of closets.
this room would make a lovely nursery.
Yes. Yellow and white wallpaper would brighten it.
what are all these things? - Herbs, mostly.
nice large bathroom.
mint, basil. - Yeah. No marijuana?
the master bedroom.
Oh, yes. - Back at the hallway again. There.
Oh, Guy!
the fireplace works, of course. - Great.
it's a wonderful apartment. I love it!
she's trying to get you to lower the rent.
we'd raise it if we were allowed. Apartments with this kind of charm...
why, that's odd.
there's a closet behind that secretary. I'm sure there is.
Yeah. I think you're right.
she moved it. It used to be there.
give me a hand, will you?
I see now why she went into a coma.
she couldn't have lifted it by herself. She was 89.
should we open it? Maybe her son should.
I'm authorised to show the apartment.
well! - Whatever she locked in got out.
perhaps she didn't need five closets.
why cover up her vacuum cleaner and her towels?
I don't suppose we'll ever know.
maybe she was becoming senile. Anything else?
what about laundry facilities?
it's bigger than the other one. - Yeah. It's more expensive, too.
it's better located.
Yeah, I could walk to all the theatres from here.
guy, let's take it, please?
that living room could be... Oh, please!
we get out of the other lease, OK.
I was tempted to write that you were drug addicts.
instead, I decided to lie and say you were wonderful.
you're great, Hutch. - Could I talk you out of it?
he's pulling your leg. - Indeed I'm not.
that looks great.
you know the Bramford had an unpleasant reputation around the turn of the century?
it's where the Trench sisters conducted their dietary experiments, and Keith Kennedy held his parties.
Adrian Marcato lived there, too...
trench sisters? - Adrian Marcato?
the Trench sisters were two Victorian ladies.
they cooked and ate young children, including a niece.
lovely. - Marcato practised witchcraft.
he made quite a splash by announcing he'd conjured up the living devil.
people attacked and nearly killed him in the lobby of the Bramford.
you're joking?
later, after the Keith Kennedy business, the house was half empty.
I didn't know Marcato lived there. - And those sisters!
I didn't know Marcato lived there. - And those sisters!
world War II filled the house up again.
terrific! - The house?
the lamb. - They called it Black Bramford.
awful things happen in every apartment house.
this house has a high incidence of unpleasant happenings.
in '59, a dead infant was found, wrapped in newspaper in the basement.
you really rouse my appetite. - Have some more wine.
Roman! Bring me in some root beer when you come!
these are shelves.
let's make love.
I think I hear the Trench sisters chewing.
straight up to the left.
here in Daytona, Florida, it's the 250cc 100-mile classic, with Yamaha leading and winning it, taking seven of the top 10 places.
it's the third straight year for Yamaha, a clean sweep.
yamaha is race-bred from champions with a model for all kinds of riding.
you should discover the swingin' world of Yamaha. Have a ride.
come on. Get on. - OK, come on. Let's go.
look!
it's great.
I'm sorry. I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress. Sorry.
that's OK. A lot of people do. I don't see any resemblance.
do you know her? - No.
my name's Terry Gionoffrio.
nice to meet you, I'm Rosemary Woodhouse. We're new tenants.
I'm staying with the Castevets. I'm their guest, since June.
our apartment was the back of yours.
you took the old lady's apartment. Mrs...?
yeah... Gardenia. - Gardenia, yeah.
she used to grow all kinds of herbs for her to cook with.
I saw those plants. - Now she grows her own things.
excuse me, I have to add softener.
what does your husband do? - He's an actor.
what's his name? - Guy Woodhouse.
he was in Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross, and he does a lot of TV.
gee, I watch TV all day long. I bet I've seen him.
I hate this basement. - Me, too.
it gives me the creeps.
let's come down together regular and do our laundry.
that'd be great.
I have a good luck charm. It might work for both of us.
that's beautiful. - Isn't it?
Mrs Castevet gave it to me.
it's supposed to be good luck. It's got some stuff inside.
I'm not mad about the smell either. I hope it works.
it's beautiful. I've never seen anything like it.
European. The Castevets are the most wonderful people in the world.
they picked me up off the sidewalk. - You were sick?
I was starving, on dope and a lot of other things.
I'm like the daughter they never had.
at first, I thought they wanted me for sex, but they're like real grandparents.
I'm glad there are people like that.
you hear so much about apathy, people who are afraid of getting involved.
I'd be dead now without them. That's a fact. Dead or in jail.
you don't have any family that could help?
a brother in the navy.
it's impossible to be 100% sure!
if you want my opinion, we shouldn't tell her! That's my opinion!
that must be the partition.
that's the back part of the original 10 with a dining room, and there's a closet here, and then there's a closet over here.
and there's a closet here, and then there's a closet over here.
stay back, lady!
get back, please. There's nothing to see.
get back, will you, please?
Jesus. - Get back!
we know her. - What's her name?
Terry. - Terry what?
ro? What was her name again? Terry what?
I don't remember. An Italian name.
she was staying with some people named Castevet.
we got that already.
short and sweet. She stuck it to the window with a Band-Aid.
come on. Get back. - Theresa Gionoffrio.
move on! Move on!
you knew her? - Only slightly.
come on, Ro, baby. Let's go. - Here they come.
you folks the Castevets? - We are.
you have a Theresa Gionoffrio living with you?
we do. Has there been an accident?
brace yourself for some bad news. She's dead. Jumped out of the window.
that's not possible! It's a mistake!
Artie, you want to let these folks take a look, please?
I knew this would happen.
she got deeply depressed every three weeks or so.
I told my wife about it, but she pooh-poohed me.
that doesn't mean she killed herself.
she was a happy girl, no reason for self-destruction.
must've been cleaning the windows. - Not at midnight!
why not? Maybe she was! - Is that her handwriting?
Yeah. - Definitely. Absolutely.
I'll see this gets back to you when we're done.
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. She was so happy.
who's the next-of-kin? - She didn't have anybody, only us.
didn't she have a brother? - Did she?
she said so, in the navy. - It's news to me.
where is he stationed? - I don't know.
she mentioned him to me in the laundry room. I'm Rosemary Woodhouse.
we're in seven-E.
I feel just the way you do, Mrs Castevet.
she seemed so happy and full of...
she said wonderful things about you, how grateful she was.
thank you.
know anything else about this brother?
no, I don't. - It should be easy to find him.
I'm so stunned. I'm so sorry. - It's such a pity.
well, thank you.
sometimes I wonder how come you're the leader of anything.
don't tell me what Laura-Louise said.
if you'd listened we wouldn't have had to do this!
we'd have been set to go now instead of having to start from scratch!
I told you not to tell her in advance!
I told you she wouldn't be open-minded!
I told Sister Veronica about the windows, and she withdrew the school from the competition.
hello. How are you? - Fine. May I come in?
of course. Please do.
I came to thank you for saying those nice things.
poor Terry. We thought we'd failed her, though her note said we hadn't.
you'll never know how helpful it was in such a shock moment.
so I do thank you. Roman does, too. Roman's my hubby.
I'm glad I could help.
well, she was cremated yesterday. We got to forget and go on.
it won't be easy. We don't have any children. You?
no. - Well, there you...
that's nice! Look how you put the table! Isn't that interesting?
I saw it in a magazine. - Nice paint job.
that's nice. What is that? The TV room?
only temporarily. It's going to be a nursery.
you're pregnant? - Not yet.
I hope to be as soon as we're settled.
you're young, you ought to have lots.
we plan to have three. - I'm dying to see the apartment.
the woman before was a friend. - Terry told me.
did she? You had some long talks in the laundry room.
only one. - Oh, my goodness!
it looks so much brighter.
what do you pay for a chair like that?
I'm not sure, really. I think about $200.
what does your hubby do? - He's an actor.
I knew it! I said it to Roman yesterday. He's so good-looking.
what movies was he in? - No movies.
two plays called Luther and Nobody Loves An Albatross, and a lot of TV and radio.
rosemary, I got a two-inch thick sirloin steak defrosting now.
why don't you and Guy have supper with us?
what do you say? - We couldn't.
why not? - No, really, that's very kind...
it would be a real help to us. First night we'll be alone since...
are you sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
honey, if it was trouble, I wouldn't ask.
all right, count on us. I'll check with Guy.
you tell him I won't take no for an answer!
here's your mail! Oh, ads. - Thank you.
Donald Baumgart got that part.
it's a bad play, anyway.
even if it folds out of town it's the kind of part that gets noticed.
Mrs Castevet was here, to thank me for what I said about Terry.
she is the nosiest person I've ever seen.
you know, she asked the prices of things?
no kidding. - She invited us for dinner tonight.
I told her I'd have to check with you, but it would probably be OK.
Jesus! We don't have to, do we? - I think they're lonely.
we get friendly with them and we'll never get rid of them.
they're right across the wall. - I told her she could count on us.
you don't have to sulk about it.
I'm not sulking. I see exactly what you mean.
hell, we'll go. - No, no. What for?
we'll go! - No. Not if you don't want to.
that sounds so phoney, but I really mean it. Really, I do.
be my good deed for the day.
OK, but only if you want to.
and we'll make it clear that it's just for this one night, all right?
perfect timing! Come in.
Roman's fixing some vodka blushes. I'm glad you could come, Guy.
I'm fixing to tell everybody that I knew you when.
dinner isn't ready just yet but sit down there.
take a seat on the couch. You'll be very...
I seem to have overfilled the glasses.
no, no, no. Don't get up.
generally, I pour these precise, don't l, Minnie?
watch the carpet.
but I've made too much, and rather... There we are. No, sit down.
Mrs Woodhouse... - Thank you.
mr Woodhouse, vodka blush? - Yes, thanks.
have you ever tasted one? - No, I haven't.
it looks delicious. - They're popular in Australia.
now, welcome to our home! - Cheers.
the carpet! - Oh, dear.
brand-new carpet. This man is so clumsy!
do you come from Australia? - No, from here in New York.
I've been there, though. I've been everywhere.
you name a place and I've been there. Go ahead, name a place.
fairbanks, Alaska! - I've been there, all over Alaska...
fairbanks, Juneau, Anchorage, Nome, Sitka, Seward.
went there in '38... - Where are you from?
well... - From Omaha. Guy's from Baltimore.
they're good cities. - Do you travel for business?
both. I'm 79, and I've been going one place or another since I was 10.
I've been everywhere.
steak's ready. Don't rush your drinks.
Roman, take your pill!
no Pope visits a city where the newspapers are on strike.
I heard he's going to wait till it's over.
that's showbiz.
that's exactly what it is. All the costumes, rituals-all religions.
we're offending Rosemary. - No, no.
are you religious, my dear? - I was brought up a Catholic.
you looked uncomfortable. - He is the Pope.
you don't have to respect him because he pretends he's holy.
that's a good point.
what they spend on robes and jewels!
a good picture of the hypocrisy behind organised religion was given in Luther. Did you ever get to play that leading part, Guy?
weren't you Albert Finney's understudy?
no. - That's strange.
I remember being struck by a gesture you made and checking to see who you were.
what gesture was that? - I'm not sure, it was a reaction...
I did a thing with my arms when Luther was having a fit.
it was a kind of involuntary reach. - That's it!
it had a wonderful authenticity. - Come on.
no, I mean it. My father was a theatrical producer.
my early years were spent in the company of Mrs Fiske, Forbes-Robertson, Modjeska.
guy? - Yes, please.
you have an interesting inner quality. It's in your TV work, too.
it should take you a long way, provided you get those initial breaks.
are you preparing for a show now? - I'm up for a couple of parts.
I can't believe you won't get them. - I can.
I'd like to have a spice garden some day.
I guess I'm a country girl at heart.
you come from a big family? - Three brothers and two sisters.
your sisters married?
they have children? - One has two, the other has four.
you'll have lots of children, too. - We're fertile.
I've got 16 nieces and nephews. - My goodness!
would you like me to wash and you can wipe for a while?
no. That's fine, dear.
Roman, stop bending Guy's ears with your Modjeska stories.
he's only listening because he's being polite.
no, it's very interesting, Mrs Castevet.
Minnie! I'm Minnie, he's Roman, OK?
OK! Terrific. Just terrific.
goodbye, darling. Goodbye. It was lovely, bless you.
Minnie! - Minnie, ya great kid, ya.
how about that steak?!
and the cake! How did you eat two pieces?
out of politeness. That's how, out of politeness.
only three dinner plates that matched.
and all that beautiful silver. - Maybe they'll will it to us.
guess what's in their bathroom? - A bidet.
jokes For The John." A book on a hook next to the toilet."
Roman's stories are pretty damned interesting, though.
I've never heard of Forbes-Robertson before.
I'm going to go there tomorrow night and hear some more.
you are? - He asked me. Do this for me.
I thought we were seeing Joan and Dick Jellico.
was that definite? - Not definite.
we'll see them next week.
you don't have to come along if you don't want to.
you can stay here. - Yeah, I think I will stay here.
he knew Henry Irving, too. I mean, really interesting.
why did they take their pictures down?
what do you mean?
their pictures. They took them down. Hooks in the wall and clean spaces.
the one picture there doesn't fit. - I didn't notice.
Hi, dear. This is my dear friend Laura-Louise McBurney, lives up on 12. This is Guy's wife, Rosemary.
Hello, Rosemary!
Laura-Louise just met Guy. Could we come in?
of course. Please do. - There you are. Go ahead.
look what they got. There's a light.
gosh! Isn't that beautiful! - It came this morning.
are you all right, dear? You look worn.
I'm fine. It's the first day of my period.
and you're up and around? On my first day, I couldn't do anything!
Dan gave me gin through a straw to kill the pain.
girls today take things more in their stride.
they're healthier than we were, thanks to vitamins, medical care...
what are those things, seat covers? - Cushions for the window seats.
Oh, yeah.
before I forget, this is for you from Roman and me.
for me?
it's a little present for moving in.
there's no reason... - It's real old, over 300 years.
it's lovely.
the green inside is tannis root. That's for good luck.
it's lovely, but I can't accept it. - You already have. Put it on.
you'll get used to the smell before you know it.
Yeah, go on.
Oh, yes.
were his stories as interesting as last night?
Yes. Did you have a good time? - All right. I got a present.
it was Terry's. - No kidding? Kind of pretty, though.
aren't you going to wear it?
it smells. There's stuff in it called tannis root from her greenhouse.
not too bad, though.
Tannis, anyone?
if you took it, you ought to wear it.
Hello? Yes, this is he.
Oh, God, no.
the poor guy.
and they don't have any idea what's causing it?
Oh, my God, that's awful. That's just awful.
Yes, I would. I mean, yes, I am.
I hate to get it that way, but...
you'd have to speak to my agent about that end of it.
alan Stone.
I'm sure there won't be any problem, not as far as we're concerned.
thank you, Mr Weiss.
guy? What is it?
Donald Baumgart. He's gone blind.
he woke up yesterday and he can't see.
Oh, no. - I've got the part.
it's a hell of a way to get it.
listen... I have to get out and walk around.
Yeah, I understand. Go ahead.
Baumgart. Donald Baumgart.
it's a fascinating part. He'll be noticed.
it's a fascinating part. He'll be noticed.
he also has an offer for a lead in a TV series, Miami Beach.
he's suddenly very hot.
now I understand why you're so overjoyed.
well, it's a difficult period in his life. A challenge.
I see.
you know how actors are, they're all a bit self-centred.
I bet even Laurence Olivier is vain and self-centred.
it's a difficult part.
he's got to work with crutches, and naturally he's preoccupied.
and he... Well, preoccupied.
you had another suicide up there at Happy House.
didn't I tell you? - No.
it was the girl who was rehabilitated by this old couple, the Castevets.
I'm sure I told you that.
they didn't rehabilitate her very successfully.
I've been a creep.
it's from worrying if Baumgart would regain his sight.
you're bound to feel two ways about it.
I'm going to stop giving you the short end of the stick.
you haven't been. - Yes, I have.
I've been tearing my hair out over my career.
let's have a baby. All right?
let's have three babies, one at a time.
a baby. You know, Mama, Dada, poo-poo. You know?
you mean it? - Sure, I mean it.
I even figured out the right time to start, look.
you really mean it, really? - No, I'm kidding. Sure, I mean it.
ro, honey, for God's sake, don't cry.
Oh, no. I won't.
here goes nothing.
the paint! The paint! - Good grief.
nobody has a fire tonight.
isn't it gorgeous? I hope we have the coldest winter ever.
shit!
Hi, Guy! How are ya?
no, don't let her in. Not tonight.
that's very kind of you.
are you sure you won't come in? - No! I don't want to bother you.
good. Good.
who says there's nothing to ESP? We shall have dessert after all!
mousse au chocolat. Or, as Minnie calls it, "chocolate mouse."
I was afraid she'd stay all evening.
she just wanted us to try it. It's one of her specialities.
it was sweet of her, really. We shouldn't make fun of her.
Yeah, you're right...
it's good.
it has an undertaste. A chalky undertaste.
I don't get it.
that's silly, there's no undertaste.
there is.
come on. The old bat slaved all day. Now eat it.
I don't like it. - It's delicious.
you have mine. - There's always something wrong.
if it's going to turn into a big thing...
if you can't stand it, don't eat it.
it's delicious! No undertaste at all.
would you turn the record over, please?
there, Daddy, do I get a gold star?
you get two of them. I'm sorry if I was stuffy.
you were.
it's the Pope at Yankee Stadium!
Christ, what a mob!
everywhere the Pope has been he's received this type of reception.
as one man put it this afternoon, "Perhaps we are being undignified, but this is a special day."
that's a great spot for my Yamaha commercial.
here's a brief summary of today's historic happenings.
Pope Paul VI arrived at 9. 27am...
what is it? - Dizzy...
no wonder. All that booze.
you didn't eat anything all day before dinner.
nice. - Sleep is what you need.
a good night's sleep. - We have to make a baby.
we'll do it. Tomorrow. There's plenty of time.
just a nap.
why are you taking them off? - To make you more comfortable.
I am more comfortable. - Sleep, Ro.
isn't Hutch coming with us? - Catholics only.
I wish we weren't bound by these prejudices, but unfortunately...
easy, easy. You've got her too high.
typhoon! Typhoon! It killed 55 people in London!
you better go down below, miss.
she's awake. She sees. - She don't see.
as long as she ate the mouse, she can't see nor hear. Now sing.
I'm sorry to hear you aren't feeling well.
it's only the mouse bite.
you'd better have your legs tied down in case of convulsions.
Yes, I suppose so. There's always a chance it was rabid.
if the music bothers you let me know and I'll stop it.
Oh, no. Please don't change the program on my account.
try to sleep. We'll be waiting up on deck.
this is no dream! This is really happening!
they tell me you have been bitten by a mouse.
Yes. That's why I couldn't come to see you.
that's all right. We wouldn't want you to jeopardise your health.
am I forgiven, Father? - Oh, absolutely.
it's after nine.
five minutes. - I have to be at Alan's at 10.
eat out. - Like hell I will.
what time is it? - It's ten after nine.
what time did I go to sleep?
you didn't go to sleep. You passed out.
from now on you get cocktails or wine, not cocktails and wine.
the dreams I had.
don't yell. I already filed them down.
I didn't want to miss baby night.
a couple of nails were ragged. - While I was out?
it was fun, in a necrophile sort of way.
I dreamed someone was raping me.
I don't know, someone inhuman. - Thanks a lot!
what's the matter? - Nothing.
I didn't want to miss the night.
we could've done it this morning. Last night wasn't the only time.
I was a little bit loaded myself, you know?
Hello! Did ya like it? - Oh, yes.
I put too much cream de cocoa in it.
no, no. You'll have to give me the recipe.
Yeah. You going shopping? Do me a teeny favour, will ya?
get me six eggs, a small instant Sanka.
right. Bye-bye.
don't you think we ought to talk about it?
what? - The way you haven't looked at me.
what? I've been looking at you. - You haven't.
sure I have. What is it? What's the matter?
nothing. Never mind.
no, don't say that. What is it? - Nothing.
look, honey, I know I've been preoccupied with the part, but it is important. That doesn't mean I don't love you.
it was due on Friday. - It was?
it'll probably come tonight or tomorrow.
wanna bet? - Yeah.
a quarter. You're gonna lose. - Shut up, will you?
you're getting me jumpy. It's only been two days.
when will I know?
I'll call you when I get the results.
I like to do a general examination just to know something more.
Elise Dunstan recommended you. - How is she?
fine. The boys are great. Did you deliver them all?
no, just the last. Universal haemoglobin.
Yes, Doctor.
we went to see The Fantasticks. - Did you? Did you enjoy it?
Yeah. - Good.
Hello? - Mrs Woodhouse?
dr Hill? - Congratulations.
Really? - Really.
are you there? - Yes, what happens now?
you come see me next month. Get those pills. One a day.
I'll mail you hospital forms. - When will it be?
it works out to be June 28th. - That sounds so far away.
it is. One more thing, we'd like another blood sample.
Yes, of course. What for?
the nurse didn't take enough, so would you drop by and see her?
but I am pregnant, aren't I?
Oh, yes, it's just for blood samp... er, blood sugar.
you're pregnant, don't worry. - I'll come in on Monday.
don't forget the pills. - No, I won't. Goodbye, Dr Hill.
blood sugar?
what's that?
that's great! That's just great.
father. - Mother.
guy, listen. Let's make this a new beginning, OK?
a new openness with each other, because we haven't been open.
that's true. I've been so self-centred. That's the trouble.
you know I love you, don't you, Ro? I swear to God, I'll be as open...
it's my fault too. - Bull, it's mine.
bear with me. I'll do better, you hear?
Oh, Guy.
what?
it's a fine way for parents to be carrying on.
know what I'd love to do? - What?
tell Minnie and Roman.
I know it's supposed to be a deep, dark secret, but I already told them we were trying. They were so pleased.
tell them. - Back in two minutes?
you're pregnant. Another blood sample.
now, that's what I call good news.
honey, congratulations. - Thank you.
best wishes, Rosemary. We're more pleased than we can say.
we didn't have any champagne but this will do.
when are you due? - June 28th.
it'll be so exciting. You got a good doctor?
Yes, very good.
one of the top obstetricians is a friend of ours, Abe Sapirstein.
delivers all the society babies.
one of the finest obstetricians in the country.
wasn't he on Open End? - That's right.
ro? - Well, what about Dr Hill?
don't worry, I'll tell him something. You know me.
I won't let you go to no Dr Hill nobody ever heard of.
the best is what you'll have! Where's your telephone?
in the bedroom. - He's a brilliant man, very sensitive.
ro, sit down, sit down. - No, I'm fine.
Abe? Minnie. A dear friend of ours just found out she's pregnant.
I'm in her apartment right now. We said you'd take care of her, you wouldn't charge your society prices neither.
just a minute. Rosemary, tomorrow morning at 11?
all right. - Yeah, 11 is fine, Abe.
Yeah, well, you, too. No, no, not at all.
all right. Well, let's hope so. Goodbye.
well, there you are. - Thanks a million, Minnie.
I don't know how to thank you. - Just have a fine, healthy baby.
my, I can't wait to tell Laura-Louise.
please don't tell anyone else, not right away.
she's right. There's plenty of time.
now, to a fine, healthy baby. - Hear, hear!
Andy. Or Susan.
Susan.
please don't read books.
no pregnancy was ever exactly like the ones in books.
and don't listen to your friends, either.
no two pregnancies are ever alike.
dr Hill prescribed vitamin pills. - No pills.
Minnie Castevet has a herbarium. I'll have her make a daily drink that'll be fresher, safer and more vitamin-rich than any pills.
any questions, call me, night or day.
call me, not your Aunt Fanny. That's what I'm here for.
here. - What's in it?
snips and snails and puppy dogs' tails.
but what if we want a girl? - Do you?
it would be nice if the first one were a boy.
there you are.
no, really, what is in it?
a raw egg, gelatin, herbs. - Tannis root?
some of that along with some other things.
if you want to be stupid be non-violent stupid.
I'm in love with no one, especially not your fat wife.
I'm a hopeless cripple...
what's that?
I've been to Vidal Sassoon. - Don't tell me you paid for that?
guy, I have a pain. - Where?
here. - Just now?
since Monday. A sharp pain. - Did you see Sapirstein?
I'm seeing him Wednesday. - This is ridiculous. Go see him.
why didn't you say? - I see him Wednesday regular.
a natural expansion of the pelvis. Take some ordinary aspirin.
I was afraid it might be an ectopic pregnancy.
I thought you weren't going to read books?
it was in the drugstore. - It just worried you.
throw it away, please? The pains will be gone in two days.
ectopic pregnancy!
I look awful.
what are you talking about? You look great.
it's that haircut that looks awful.
you want the truth, honey, that's the worst mistake you ever made.
my God! - It's Vidal Sassoon. It's very in.
what's wrong with you? - Do I look that bad?
terrible! You're not on one of those Zen diets?
no. - Then what is it?
have you seen a doctor?
I might as well tell you. I'm pregnant.
rubbish. Pregnant women gain weight. They don't lose it.
I don't sleep well. I have stiff joints or something, so I get a pain.
nothing serious. - Well, congratulations.
you must be very happy. - I am. We both are.
who's your obstetrician? - Abraham Sapirstein.
he delivered two of my daughter's babies.
he's one of the best. - When did you see him last?
yesterday. - And?
and he says it's fairly common.
how much weight have you lost? - Three pounds.
you've lost far more than that.
it's perfectly normal to lose a little at first.
later on, I'll be gaining.
we must assume Dr Sapirstein knows whereof he speaks.
he should. He charges enough.
we get bargain rates. Our neighbours are his friends.
I'll go.
stay where you are. It hurts less when I move around.
I was just talking about you. - Favourably, I hope.
do you need anything? - No. Thank you for asking.
is Guy home already? - He won't be home till six.
a friend of ours is here. Would you like to meet him?
if I won't be intruding? - No. Please come in.
hutch, this is Roman Castevet. Edward Hutchins.
how do you do? - How are you, sir?
I was just telling Hutch you sent me to Dr Sapirstein.
rosemary told you the news? - Yes.
she must get plenty of rest. - I was alarmed by her appearance.
she has lost some weight, but that's quite normal.
later she'll gain, probably too much.
so I gather. - Please sit down.
Mrs Castevet makes a vitamin drink for me from herbs she grows.
all according to Dr Sapirstein's directions.
he's suspicious of commercially prepared vitamin pills.
but they're manufactured under every imaginable safeguard.
true, but pills can sit for months on a druggist's shelf, and lose their original potency.
I hadn't thought of that. - I like having everything natural.
I'll bet expectant mothers chewed tannis root before vitamin pills.
tannis root? - It's one of the herbs in the drink.
is it an herb? Can a root be an herb?
you don't mean anise or orrisroot? - No, tannis.
look.
it's good luck, too.
doesn't look like root matter, more like mould or fungus of some kind.
is it ever called any other name? - Not to my knowledge, no.
tannis. I must look it up in the encyclopaedia.
what a pretty holder or charm. - The Castevets gave it to me.
you seem to be taking better care of Rosemary than her own parents.
we're very fond of her. And Guy. Now excuse me, I'll have to go.
my wife is waiting. - It's nice to have met you.
don't bother, Rosemary. We'll meet again, I'm sure.
don't bother, Rosemary. We'll meet again, I'm sure.
I just noticed he has pierced ears.
pierced ears and piercing eyes. What's she like?
nosy. Funny. Guy's gotten very close to them.
I suppose they've become sort of parent figures for him.
and you? - I don't know.
sometimes they're too friendly and helpful.
Hey, what a surprise. How are you, Hutch? Good to see you.
you're the surprise. What happened? - They had a rewrite.
stay where you are. Nobody move. - Would you like some coffee?
love some!
loot! - Congratulations are in order.
wonderful, isn't it? - When's the baby due?
june 28th. Dr Sapirstein delivered two of Hutch's grandchildren.
Really?
I met your neighbour, Roman Castevet.
did you? Funny old duck, isn't he? - He has pierced ears.
you're kidding? - No, I saw.
we haven't seen you lately, but I'm so busy and Ro's pregnant, so we haven't seen anyone.
let's have dinner soon. - You're not going?
thanks for the coffee. - Thanks for coming.
this isn't mine. It must be yours.
right. Have you thought about names, or is it too soon?
andrew or Douglas for a boy, Melinda or Sarah for a girl.
what happened to Susan? - Is there another of these?
I don't see it, Hutch. - No, it's not here.
I probably left it at the City Centre. I'll stop back there.
let's have that dinner, shall we? - Next week.
goodbye. - Goodbye.
that was a nice surprise. - Guess what he said.
what? - I look terrible.
good old Hutch. Spreading cheer wherever he goes.
I'm going to get a paper, honey.
he's a professional crepehanger. - He's not.
then he's a top-ranking amateur.
hello. She's not feeling too well.
I think she's asleep.
she could be, yeah.
all right, can you hold on a minute?
it's Hutch. He wants to speak to you.
I told him you were resting but he said it couldn't wait.
hutch? - Dear, do you go out at all?
well, I haven't been going out, why?
can you meet me tomorrow morning in front of the Time-Life Building?
if you want me to. What is it? Can't you tell me now?
I'd rather not. We can have an early lunch.
that would be nice. - Good. 11 o'clock?
OK. Did you find your glove?
they didn't have it. Good night, Rosemary. Sleep well.
you, too. Good night.
what was that? - He wants to talk to me.
what about? - I don't know. He wouldn't say.
those boys' adventure stories are going to his head.
where are you meeting him?
time and Life Building tomorrow at 11 o'clock.
you're pregnant, I've got the yens.
I'm getting an ice-cream. Want one? - I'd love one.
vanilla? - OK.
Minnie, I'm going out now, so I won't have my drink at 11.
fine, dear. Take it later. Buzz me when you get back.
pain, begone. I will have no more of thee.
yes? - Is this Edward Hutchins' apartment?
Yes. Who is this? - My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
I had an appointment with Mr Hutchins. Is he there?
Hello? - He was taken ill this morning.
taken ill? - Yes.
he's in a deep coma at St Vincent's Hospital.
that's awful. I just spoke to him last night about 10. 30.
I spoke to him at 11. - Who is this?
you don't know me. I'm Grace Cardiff, Hutch's friend.
do they know what's causing it? - No, they don't know yet.
he's totally unresponsive. I'm going to the hospital now.
is there anything I can do? - Not really.
all right, thank you.
No! This is what I call the long arm of coincidence!
I said to myself, if Rosemary's going out,
I might as well do some Christmas shopping.
now here you are, here I am. Isn't that something?
darling, what's the matter? You feel all right?
you poor thing.
you know what? I think we better be going home now. What do you say?
no, you have your shopping to do. - There's two more weeks.
it'll stop any day now.
it's like a wire inside me tightening.
usually older women with less flexible joints have this trouble.
I'm not going out. - You don't have to.
one minute to go!
rosemary, meet Dr Shand. He used to be a famous dentist.
he made the chain for your charm. - How do you do?
come on, sweetie. Put this wonderful hat on.
doctor, come over here.
Minnie, Minnie! - Happy New Year.
have a good year. - Happy New Year.
to 1966! The year one!
what the hell are you doing?
planning the menu. We're having a party a week from Saturday.
it's for our old... I mean, our young friends.
Minnie and Roman are not invited. Neither is Laura-Louise.
nor is Dr Sapirstein.
it's a very special party. You have to be under 60 to get in.
well... for a minute there, I didn't think I was going to make it.
you'll make it. You can be bartender.
swell. Do you really think it's such a good idea?
it's the best idea I've had in months.
shouldn't you check with Dr Sapirstein?
I'm giving a party, not swimming the English Channel.
what about the pain?
haven't you heard? lt'll go away in a day or two.
that looks interesting. - We're having some people over.
you feel up to entertaining?
Yes. These are old friends that I haven't seen in a long time.
they don't even know I'm pregnant. - I'll give you a hand if you like.
no, thank you, Minnie, but I can manage.
it's a buffet, and we'll get a bartender, so...
I'll help take the coats.
no, really, you do too much for me as it is.
well, let me know if you change your mind.
drink your drink, hon.
I'd rather not. Not right this minute.
I'll drink it in a little while.
it don't do to let it stand. - No, I won't.
you go back, I'll bring the glass back later.
I'll wait. Save you the walk.
it makes me very nervous when people watch me cook. Now, scoot.
don't let it stand too long, it'll lose its vitamins.
you dirty, stinking secret-keeper. Congratulations!
Congratulations. - Thank you.
Hey, Rosie. - Yeah?
Bob and Leo got stuck at another party but they'll be over.
fine. - Rosie, it's a fantastic house!
Hi. It's been so long. - You look like a piece of chalk.
you make him feed you, love.
Adrian Marcato lived here. - And the Trench sisters.
they ate little children.
he doesn't just mean they ate them. He means they ate them.
I make their first one strong to get them happy.
Rosie, do you feel OK? You look tired.
thanks for the understatement.
how do you like CC Hill? Isn't he a dream boy?
but I'm not going to him. - You're not?
I've got another doctor named Sapirstein.
congratulations, Papa. - Thanks. Nothing to it.
I'll take that dip inside. - Yeah, please. See my flowers?
Yeah. Elise, will you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.
is the other guy still blind?
Donald Baumgart? You know who he is. The boy Zoe Piper lives with.
he's writing a play. - Is he still blind?
Yeah. He's going through hell trying to adjust.
he dictates and Zoe writes. Imagine the courage of this guy.
he's just been blind a few months.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just had a cramp for a minute.
don't cry. - It's good for her.
let her cry it out. It's all right, darling. Sit down.
out, out! - Let me in.
girls only. - I want to see Rosemary.
she's busy. - I have to wash these...
use the bathroom.
it hurts so much. I'm so afraid the baby's gonna die.
when did the pain start?
in November.
November?! - What?
you have been in pain since November, and he's not helping?
he says it's gonna stop.
why don't you see another doctor? - No, he's very good.
he was on Open End. - He sounds like a sadistic nut.
rosemary, pain like that is a warning that something isn't right.
go see Dr Hill. Go see anybody besides that... that...
that nut. - Don't go on suffering like this.
I won't have an abortion.
nobody's telling you to. Just see another doctor.
the thing to do now is move.
guy? - Yeah?
I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.
dr Sapirstein is either lying, or he's...
I don't know, out of his mind.
pain like this is a warning something's wrong.
rosemary... - I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.
I want vitamins in pills like everyone else.
I haven't drunk it for three days. I've thrown it away.
you've what? - I've made my own drink.
is that what those bitches were giving you in there?
and is that their hint for today? - They're my friends...
they're not very bright bitches who should mind their own business!
they said get a second opinion.
rosemary, you know who Dr Hill is? He's a Charlie nobody.
that's who he is!
I'm tired of hearing how great Dr Sapirstein is.
we'll have to pay Sapirstein, pay Hill. It's out of the question.
no, I'm not changing. I just wanna get a second opinion.
I won't let you do it, Ro.
I mean, because it's, uh... it's not fair to Sapirstein.
not fair to...?
what are you talking about? What about what's fair to me?
you want a second opinion?
you tell Sapirstein and let him decide who gives it.
No! I want Dr Hill!
at least have that much courtesy... - If you won't pay, I'll...
rosemary? What is it? - It stopped.
what? - The pain stopped just like that.
stopped? - Stopped.
what was in that drink you made?
eggs, milk, sugar. - What else?
what else?
come on, Rosemary, for Christ's sake, what else was in that drink?
it's alive! Guy, it's moving! It's alive! It's all right!
feel. Feel. - Yeah, I felt it.
don't be scared. It won't bite you. - It's wonderful. It really is.
I feel it kicking. It's alive! It's moving!
I'll clean up some of this mess.
watch the walls.
Thanks, have one on the baby. - Thank you very much.
what's that for?
it's my hospital suitcase. - You got three weeks.
yes? Hello, Mrs Cardiff.
no. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Yes, of course I will.
hutch is dead.
I feel awful. All this time, I didn't even think of him.
doctor. Doris, we'll see you later.
I beg your pardon. I'm Mrs Woodhouse. I knew your father.
you're Rosemary? - I'm so sorry.
thank you. This is my sister. - How do you do?
and my husband. - How do you do?
I'm sorry to be late.
excuse me. I'm Grace Cardiff. - I was hoping to meet you.
I was going to mail this, but I thought you'd be here.
what is it? - A book.
hutch regained consciousness and thought it was the next morning.
you had the appointment? - Oh, yes.
I wasn't there, but he told the doctor to make sure you got the book.
thank you.
and I'm to tell you the name is an anagram.
the name of the book? - Apparently.
he was delirious, so it's hard to be sure.
I heard you come in. It wasn't very long.
I was late. I couldn't get a taxi. - What a shame. You got mail already?
somebody gave it to me. - Here, I'll hold it. Book?
I know that house! The Gilmores used to live there.
I've been there lots of times. Grace... one of my favourite names.
Yes. - You need anything?
nothing, thank you. - Take a nap.
I'm going to. - Goodbye.
born in Glasgow in 1846, he was soon after brought to New York.
he resided for several years in the United St...
he was attacked by a mob outside the Bram...
outside, not in the lobby.
there are no witches. Not really.
the name is an anagram.
now
what's with the chain?
what's the matter?
you all right? - I'm fine.
thank you.
how was the funeral? - OK.
I got the shirt that was in the New Yorker.
I got that shirt that was in the New Yorker.
that's nice. Do you know who Roman really is?
what do you mean? - Adrian Marcato's son.
what? - Come here.
I want to show you something.
Roman Castevet is Steven Marcato rearranged.
it's from Hutch.
look.
and look here. There he is when he was 13. See the eyes?
coincidence. - In the same house? And look here.
soon after that in August, 1886, his son Steven was born.
1886, got it? That makes him 79 now. No coincidence.
no, I guess not. He's Steven Marcato, all right. Poor old geezer.
with a crazy father like that, no wonder he switched his name around.
you don't think he's the same? - What do you mean, a witch?
ro, are you kidding? Ro, honey.
his father was a martyr to it. Do you know how he died?
honey, it's 1966.
this was published in 1933. There were covens in Europe.
that's their name, the congregation.
covens in Europe, America, Australia and one right here.
the parties with the singing and the flute and the chanting, - Those are Sabbaths. - Don't get excited.
read what they do. They use blood in their rituals.
and the most powerful is baby's blood.
they use the flesh, too. - For God's sakes!
they're not entering this apartment again or coming near the baby.
they're old people with old friends!
dr Shand happens to play the recorder!
I'm not taking any chances. We'll sublet, move out.
we are not. We'll talk about it later.
I don't think you ought to read any more of that.
just this last chapter. - Not today.
look. Your hands are shaking. Come on. Give it to me.
I mean it, now. Give it to me.
fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
what was the name? Marchado? - Marcato.
he said his father was an importer. - He told Guy he was a producer.
I understand how disturbed you must be with him for a neighbour.
I don't want anything more to do with him, or Minnie.
I can't take the slightest chance. - Any mother would feel the same.
is there any chance that Minnie put something harmful in those drinks, or in those little cakes?
no, I'd have seen evidence long ago.
I won't take anything else from them.
I can give you some pills that'll be adequate these last few weeks.
in a way, this may be the answer to Minnie and Roman's problem, too.
what do you mean? - Roman's very ill.
confidentially, he has no more than a month or two left.
he wanted to visit his favourite cities.
they didn't want to offend you by leaving before the birth.
I'm sorry to hear that.
he'd be extremely embarrassed if he knew you found out.
suppose we do this. I'll tell him to leave on Sunday.
I'll say I spoke to you.
will they leave on Sunday? - I'll see to it.
our thoughts are gonna be with you till you're all happy and thin again, your sweet little boy or girl laying safely in your arms.
thanks for everything. - Make Guy send us lots of pictures.
I will.
I won't wish you luck because you won't need it.
you'll have a happy life.
have a good trip and come back safely.
perhaps. But I may stay in Dubrovnik or Pescara, or maybe Majorca.
we shall see, we shall see. - Come back.
Bye, Minnie. - Yeah.
goodbye, Roman. Bye-bye. Take care.
kennedy Airport, Pan Am Building. - Bye, Minnie. Bye, Roman.
Oh, boy.
Where's my book?
I put it in the garbage. - What?
I didn't want you upsetting yourself.
guy, Hutch gave me that book. He left it to me.
I wasn't thinking of that. - That's terrible.
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking about Hutch.
watch out, lady!
in some cults, it was believed "that a personal possession of the victim was necessary "and spells cannot be cast without one of the victim's belongings.
is this Donald Baumgart? - That's right.
this is Rosemary Woodhouse, Guy Woodhouse's wife.
Oh, yes! - I want to know...
you must be a happy lady, living in the Bram...
I wanted to know how you are. - Well, bless your heart.
guy Woodhouse's wife, huh?
well, I'm splendid. I've only broke six glasses today.
guy and I are both very unhappy that he got his break because of your misfortune.
what the hell. That's the way it goes, right?
I'm sorry I didn't come along that day he came to visit you.
visit? No... You mean the day we met for drinks?
Yes, that's what I meant.
by the way, he has something of yours, you know.
what do you mean?
don't you know? - No.
didn't you miss anything that day?
you don't mean my tie, do you? - Yes.
well, he's got mine, and I've got his.
he can have it back. - I'm sorry...
doesn't matter to me now what colour tie I wear.
I thought he'd only borrowed it. - No, no. It was a trade.
or... do you think he stole it? - I have to hang up now.
I just wanted to know if there'd been any improvement.
no, there isn't. It was nice of you to call.
you aren't in labour? - No, but I have to see the doctor.
but he has to leave at five, and there is Mrs Byron.
I'm sure he'll see you. Sit down. - Thank you.
how is it out there? - Awful. 94.
see you next week. Make an appointment.
I will.
you're due any day, aren't you? - Tuesday.
smart to get it over with before August.
Mrs Byron? He'll see you right after.
well, let's see... July the 10th?
what time? - Four o'clock? All right.
Bye-bye. Good luck. - Thank you.
that smells nice. What is it?
Oh, my... It's called Detchema.
it's better than your regular, if you don't mind my saying.
that was a good luck charm. I threw it away.
good. Maybe the doctor will follow your example.
dr Sapirstein? - Yes. The aftershave.
but it isn't, is it? I don't think he has a good luck charm.
anyway, he has the same smell once in a while. And when he does...
haven't you ever noticed? - No.
maybe you thought it was your own you were smelling.
what is it, a chemical thing?
will you excuse me a moment, please? My husband is waiting outside.
I have to go and tell him something. I'll be back.
dr Hill's office. - Dr Hill, please.
this is his answering service. Would you like to leave a message?
Yes. My name is Rosemary Woodhouse.
Woodhouse. Would you ask him to call me back right away, please?
my number is 475-2598.
it's an emergency. I'm in a phone booth.
all right.
quickly, please, Dr Hill, call me.
Oh, really? Did he really say that? He didn't say that?
what else was it that he said?
that's wonderful. That's wonder... That's marvellous.
Yes. Dr Hill?
is it Rosemary Woodhouse? - Yes.
are you Dr Hill's patient? - No.
Yes. I mean, well, I've seen him once.
please tell him he has to speak to me. It's important.
tell him to call me, hm? - All right.
thank you.
all of them. All of them.
all in it together. All of them. All of them witches.
don't worry, little Andy or Jenny,
I'll kill them before I let them touch you.
Yes. Dr... - Mrs Woodhouse?
Yes! Thank you, thank you for calling me.
I thought you were in California.
no. I've been to another doctor, and he isn't good, Dr Hill.
he's been lying to me and giving me unusual kinds of drinks and capsules.
the baby's due on Tuesday. Remember you told me June 28th?
I want you to deliver it. - Mrs Woodhouse...
please, let me talk to you. Let me explain what's been going on.
I can't stay too long here. They'll be coming, looking for me.
dr Hill, there's a plot... I know that sounds crazy.
you're probably thinking, This girl has flipped,
but I haven't flipped, Dr Hill, I swear, by all the saints.
there are plots against people, aren't there?
I suppose there are. - There's one against me and my baby.
come see me tomorrow after five. - Now! Right now.
Mrs Woodhouse, I'm home. I've been up since yesterday morning...
I beg you. I beg you.
I can't stay here.
my office at eight o'clock. - Thank you!
Oh, wait! Dr Hill? - Yes?
my husband may call you... - I'm not gonna speak to anyone.
I'm gonna take a nap. - Thank you.
keep the change.
driver, please, could you wait and watch until I'm inside the door?
he lied. He said we were going to Hollywood.
the worst thing is he's involved.
he sleeps in pyjamas now. He never used to.
he's probably hiding a mark.
they give you marks when you join... all sorts of rituals.
they hold Sabbaths there. You could hear them.
guy, my husband, said it was Dr Shand, one of them playing a recorder.
now, how did he know it was Dr Shand unless he was there with them?
they're very clever people.
they planned everything from the beginning.
they probably made some deal with Guy.
they gave him success, and he promised them our baby to use in their rituals.
I know this sounds crazy, but I've got books here. Look.
there was another actor like him, Donald Baumgart, they put a spell on him and made him blind so Guy could get his part.
look, here.
I had this friend, Edward Hutchins, a writer.
he wrote stories for boys.
he was my good friend since I first came to New York.
may I keep this? - Yes, please.
and, look. Anyway, once Mr Hutchins came to visit me...
it was the time I was having this pain, Doctor.
I was suffering so... You can't imagine how much I was suffering, and they wouldn't help me.
they were giving me a drink with tannis root in it.
also witches' stuff, tannis root.
hutch came and immediately saw something was wrong.
he knew about witches.
guy rushed in with his makeup on, which he never did.
they probably called him to come home and steal one of Hutch's belongings.
he took his glove and they put a spell on him, too.
put him in a coma. Three months later he died.
maybe all this is coincidence, but one thing is for sure, they have a coven and want my baby.
certainly seems that way.
I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.
I don't believe in witchcraft, but there are plenty of crazy people in this city.
the doctor's name is Shand? - No, Dr Shand is one of them.
the doctor's name is Sapirstein. - Abraham Sapirstein?
Yeah. Do you know him? - I've met him once or twice.
to look at him, you'd never think...
no, you wouldn't. Not in a million years.
would you like to go into Mount Sinai now, this evening?
I would love to. Would that be possible?
it's difficult, but we'll try.
I want you to lie down and get some rest.
Thanks. Anything they've got, even a broom closet would be fine.
I hope we can do better than that.
I'll see what I can do, then I'll check you over.
should I undress now?
no. It'll take about a half hour. You just lie down, rest.
God bless Dr Hill.
everything's going to be OK now, Andy or Jenny.
we're going to be in a nice, clean hospital with no visitors.
monsters.
monsters.
unspeakable. Unspeakable.
I was sleeping.
come with us quietly, Rosemary. Don't argue or make a scene.
if you say anything more about witches we'll take you to a mental hospital.
you don't want that, do you? So put your shoes on.
we just want to take you home. No one's going to hurt you.
or the baby. Put your shoes on.
she's fine now.
we're going to go home and rest. - That's all it takes.
thank you, Doctor. - Glad I could help, sir.
it's a shame you had to come here.
good evening, Mrs Woodhouse.
Mrs Woodhouse! Mrs Woodhouse!
come on, open up, Ro. - Go to hell!
come on, honey. - You promised them the baby!
I didn't promise them anything!
rosemary, you're... - You, too!
Elise? - Mrs Dunstan is out.
who is this? - The babysitter.
where is she? - At the movies.
this is Rosemary. Ask her to call me when she gets home.
it's terribly urgent. Don't forget.
don't worry. I'll tell her. - Thank you.
we don't want to hurt you, Ro. - We're your friends, Rosemary.
there's nothing to be afraid of. Honest there isn't.
this is just a mild sedative. - I wouldn't let anyone...
help me!
ro, baby. - Somebody help me!
wait a minute. Wait a minute now.
we're in labour here. - Here?
you'll be all right, baby. You're going to be perfectly all right.
there were supposed to be doctors, hospitals!
everything clean and sterile!
Hello? She isn't here, Elise.
Andy... Andy or Jenny...
I'm sorry, my little darling. Forgive me.
Hi.
Hi.
is it all right? - Yes, it's fine.
what is it? - A boy.
Really? A boy?
and it's all right? - Yes.
where is it? - My goodness!
gee, what a start you gave me. My goodness.
the baby, where is it? - You wait here one minute.
Where's my baby? - I'll go find Dr Abe. Just wait.
Where's the baby?
where is it? - Honey...
there were complications, but nothing that will affect future births.
it's... - Dead. It was in the wrong position.
in hospital I might have done something.
honey, we can have others.
you can try again in a few months.
when you're better.
no. I don't believe you. You're both lying.
you're lying! It didn't die! You took it! You're lying!
you're witches! You're lying! You're lying! You're lying!
abe says it's called pre-partum.
I don't know. It's some kind of a hysteria.
boy, you were really kapow, out of your mind.
I know where you got the idea that Minnie and Roman were witches, but how come you thought that Abe and I joined the party?
let's face it, darling, you had the pre-partum crazies.
now you're gonna rest and you're gonna get over them.
I know this is the worst thing that ever happened to you, but now everything's gonna be roses.
paramount's right where we want them, Universal's interested, and we're gonna blow this town and be in beautiful Beverly with a pool and a spice garden, the whole schmeer, and kids, too, Ro.
Scout's honour. You heard what Abe said.
now, I got to run now and get famous.
let me see your shoulder.
let me see your shoulder.
are you kidding? - Your left shoulder.
all right. Anything you say.
I generally prefer doing this to music. Left shoulder.
right shoulder.
that's as far as I go without a blue light.
the high pressure area has been causing this heat, and will be staying with us through the week.
it will be overcast upstate New York as well, with the possibility of thunder showers tonight clearing by tomorrow night.
all you people leaving the city this weekend should find it hot.
do you hear a baby crying?
why, no, I don't, dear.
now, into your bed now. It's time for you to take your pill.
did you turn the air conditioner off?
well, you mustn't do that, dear.
people are actually dying, it's so hot.
what do you do with the milk?
why, throw it away. Your pill, Rosemary.
Hello, girls. 95 out.
some new people moved on in up in eight.
do they have a baby? - How'd you know that?
I heard it crying.
wait a minute.
no. Don't do that. - Why not?
a little messy, that's all.
easy, easy.
got her too high.
hell, Hayato. You're making fun of me.
you're pulling my leg, like we say.
rosemary, go back to bed. You know you're not supposed to be up.
the mother? - Rosemary...
shut up. You're in Dubrovnik. I don't hear you.
what have you done to it?
what have you done to its eyes?
he has his father's eyes.
what are you talking about? Guy's eyes are normal.
what have you done to him, you maniacs?!
Satan is his father, not Guy.
he came up from hell and begat a son of mortal woman.
hail, Satan. - Hail, Satan.
Satan is his father, and his name is Adrian.
he shall overthrow the mighty and lay waste their temples.
he shall redeem the despised, and wreak vengeance in the name of the burned and the tortured!
hail, Adrian!
hail, Satan! Hail, Satan!
he chose you. Out of all the women in the whole world, he chose you.
he wanted you to be the mother of his only son.
his power is stronger than stronger!
his might shall last longer than longer!
hail, Satan!
No! It can't be!
go look at his hands. - And his feet.
Oh, God!
God is dead! Satan lives! The year is one!
the year is one and God is done!
the year is one! - Hail, Adrian!
hail, Satan!
why don't you help us out, Rosemary? Be a real mother to Adrian.
you don't have to join if you don't want to.
just be a mother to your baby.
Minnie and Laura-Louise are too old. It's not right.
think about it, Rosemary.
Oh, God!
shut up or we'll kill you, milk or no milk.
you shut up. Rosemary's his mother. Show some respect.
come, my friend. Come see him. Come see the child.
what would you like to drink?
they promised you wouldn't be hurt, and you haven't been, really.
I mean, supposing you had the baby and you lost it.
wouldn't that be the same?
and we're getting so much in return, Ro.
guy, let me introduce you to Argyron Stavropoulos.
how proud you must be. Is this the mother? Why in the name of...
here, drink this. - What's in it? Tannis root?
just plain, ordinary Lipton's tea. You drink it.
get away from here. Roman! - You're rocking him too fast.
sit down! Put her where she belongs.
you're rocking him too fast. That's why he's crying.
mind your own business. - Let Rosemary rock him.
sit with the others. - She's liable to...
sit down with the others, Laura-Louise.
rock him.
you're trying to get me to be his mother.
chief investigator of the clinical trial agreed I would be able to travel if there is continuity of care.
our marriage has been on hold since that crazy night it first began.
we'll take the time we need to work through this.
and then we need to focus on us...
we need to go to marriage counseling. - On our honeymoon.
marriage counseling.
you'll be on bed rest... No going to work, no going anywhere that's farther than the fridge.
you'll need help.
are you two...? - No, we're just friends, and I'll be taking care of her.
jeremiah, what if you could return to Hankmed and not work with me at all.
how would that be possible?
you would be in charge.
just out of curiosity, does your offer still stand?
I would need a full commitment.
how long till we leave?
how fast can you pack?
young man, where is Divya?
uh, which one is she, the Indian one?
I have another one of these in an hour.
you double-booked puja ceremonies?
Pujas don't pay as much as weddings.
I have to overcommit to cover my nuts.
I think it's "nut."
I'll track her down for you.
inappropriate for this setting?
highly inappropriate. - Oh.
but I hear there's a dozen empty bedrooms upstairs.
Oh, really? - Quiet, private.
in fact, some of them probably haven't seen action in years.
well, I feel really bad for those rooms, uh...
more so for myself, actually, 'cause I need to find Divya right now.
I'll assume that's an unrelated matter.
highly unrelated.
have you seen her? - No.
no, good call. Where is he at?
so when was the last time Divya spoke to the father?
Oh, I-I'm not sure. We're just good friends...
and roommates and, uh...
but I don't know all the details of her life.
do you know where Divya is?
Oh, yes, I do. Here, follow me.
Sashi, your blouse is blue, just like that sky up there.
Hey, you two. - Hey.
what are you doing way over here?
I'm hiding from the army of random Hampton notables my father has invited.
who has ever heard of hiring a P. R. firm for a puja ceremony?
who ever heard of a puja ceremony?
your dad is so excited to be a grandpa.
he's excited to be the center of attention for a change.
hmm, well, you, Divya, need to keep up with today's schedule.
it's time to start already?
Yeah, your pundit has summoned you.
all we're missing now is Hank.
Evan, you know that Hank RSVP'd "maybe.
when did "maybe" become the new "no," guys? Come on.
well, Rafa declined the old-fashioned way.
he just said, "decline."
Oh. - Did he give a reason?
uh, his latest stalker.
the police are after her, and he didn't want to attract any craziness to the puja.
Mm-hmm. All right, giddy up.
Hey, babe, listen, um, I know you miss Hank,
but do you think you might be projecting?
what do you mean?
I just don't want to see you get hurt, like last time.
hey guys, we don't need to find a new doctor for the summer, okay?
Hank will be back.
Evan, you're being unrealistic.
Boris' clinical trial won't even end until August.
why don't I pull some resumes, just in case?
that sounds like a fair compromise. - Agreed.
I'm really proud of the way you just stepped outside of yourself.
okay, so, Jeremiah, that covers personnel.
good. What's next?
next, you guys discuss outstanding follow-ups while I continue making headbands for the Valentine's Day party.
you know what?
I will help you. - Oh, good.
how... oh, my goodness. How am I going to help you?
um, what do you think of this one?
you're like a headband savant.
we got another call from Mrs. Abovsky.
her abdominal discomfort hasn't abated.
let's move her up in the schedule.
she's complaining of nausea, cramps, sharp pains...
we're acting out symptoms now? - No.
no, I'm... I'm having a contraction.
Oh my God. - Oh! Ho ho.
and now the father of the mother will address all those congregated here.
rubina and I have the distinct honor of informing you that Divya's daughter has been named Sashi after her grandmother, my beloved mother.
it has taken 30 years, but Divya has finally embraced her heritage.
Divya bet, I'm so proud of you, as are all of us here.
Hello?
Hello?
anyone home?
you embraced your heritage?
well, I realized the importance of having a legacy to pass down to my child like that bottle of gripe water.
exactly, though medically speaking, I would never use that stuff on my baby.
my mother used it to soothe my stomach when I was little, so I carry it around everywhere as a token of family tradition.
you forgot the gripe water. - Yes.
Oh, it's your phone again.
is everything okay?
no. Rafa says that his stalker may be in the Hamptons.
he wants me to alert Shadow Pond security.
I'll alert security and then fetch the gripe water.
thank you, Jeremiah.
hello.
Hi.
should I just leave my present here?
Oh, yes. Divya's looking forward to opening them after the party.
I had no idea that Divya had such a nice place.
Oh, no... this is the Lawson residence.
Divya's just throwing the party here.
Oh, so the party's still going on?
technically, it hasn't started yet.
they're doing the ceremony now.
I'm Jeremiah.
I'm Emma.
I'm a friend of Divya's.
Oh. Well, I'm just grabbing something for the baby, - then I can show you to her. - Great.
Wow. That is the biggest house I have ever seen.
at 109, 000 square feet, it's the biggest house most people have ever seen.
uh, well, I have to get this to Divya.
I'll see you inside.
I am sure it was just an RSVP mix-up.
I'm sorry. I don't even see you on the invitee list.
Hi, Liz.
Hi, I don't believe that we've met. I'm Divya.
Oh, hi. I'm Emma.
Hi, Emma.
and you are?
I'm a friend of Jeremiah's. - Really?
a friend of Jeremiah's?
Yeah, um, a family friend.
I'll escort her in, guys. Thank you.
thank you. - You're welcome.
Oh, uh, there's Jeremiah. I should go say hello to him.
okay.
how nice that he invited someone.
Yeah.
I hope you enjoy the party.
Yeah, I definitely will. - Hmm.
welcome home. - Likewise, Hank.
I hope you enjoy your stay, all 24 hours of it.
watch your step, Boris.
I'm more concerned with other people watching it.
remember, Hank, we must preserve appearances at all costs.
I can't believe how big Sashi's gotten.
you blink at her age, you miss a lot.
thank you for stopping through on your way to wherever you and Boris are headed to next.
uh, to be honest, I've kind of lost track of our itinerary myself.
I saw him limping earlier. Is he okay?
Yeah, I saw that too. Has his family disease finally kicked in or...?
no, no, no, no. Nothing has kicked in.
it's totally unrelated to his disease.
uh, we were cliff diving in the Caymans, and he fractured his tibia.
Ouch. - Yeah.
cliff diving? - When is his cast coming off?
uh, actually, it should come off today.
great. - Yeah.
Hey. See... I thought you were in labor.
she's not in labor.
we don't have to cancel our party, and you need to dip faster to keep up with my stirring.
Dr. Neil determined that the pain earlier was Braxton Hicks.
that means a practice contraction.
Oh, I totally knew that.
remember what you learned in therapy.
humility is a strength.
I totally didn't know that.
in fairness, I was humbling Evan long before his therapist was.
so, if you're not giving birth today, shouldn't you be back in bed?
that's the good news. I am off bed rest.
now? So close to the day?
well, the onset of labor is measured by cervical change, and Divya's cervix is...
not something I'm interested in, but thank you.
Thanks, Jeremiah.
what? - Ugh. Lance hurt his arm.
who's Lance? - He's the lead singer and guitar player for the band we booked for tonight.
sounds like someone should check him out.
can you?
um, I'm not sure I can squeeze in another patient.
Divya, you're cleared to stand, walk, and work, right?
I am.
you know, I'm actually not sure that's such a good idea.
he's all the way out in Montauk.
I can probably shuffle something around.
guys, I got it. Really.
Divya, you're my hero. - Mm.
with Valentine's Day hanging in the balance, you are definitely the man for the job.
Hey! You're home!
Hey! You're not answering any of my texts!
Oh, sorry. I was dipping strawberries in chocolate.
Hey, I checked with the hospital, but they didn't have you admitted yet.
you called Hank. - Hey, Jeremiah.
it was Braxton Hicks. - Ah.
but welcome home! - Thank you.
really, Evan? - You said "contraction."
how am I... I thought...
the point is, I'm so happy to see you.
you're here in the nick of time.
someone needs to save Valentine's Day, Henry, and Divya's in no condition to go driving around seeing patients, right?
you are definitely the man for the job.
we have a musician in Montauk with an injured arm.
Henry, he's desperate.
Yeah, I'm happy to help. Just let me grab a quick shower.
you realize you still haven't given me a "welcome home" hug.
let's talk after that shower. - Okay, will do.
good to see you guys.
old-school Hankmed back in action.
you think giving Hank a patient will keep him here?
it's never just a patient with Hank.
Wow. No, I... trust me, I'd love to fly to L. A. And play the new forum with you, but I just don't think I'm ready for that.
sorry, Billy.
sorry, Dr. Lawson, to keep you waiting, especially since there's probably not much you can do.
it's "Hank," and let's have a look before you turn down another trip to Hollywood.
he's always trying to get me to play on the road.
I'm not nearly good enough for his shows, but, you know, it's never easy saying no to the piano man.
wait a second. I'm sorry. That Billy was... Billy?
he saw me play at a bar over on 27.
he must've taken pity on me, because he's been calling me ever since.
Wow. That's very cool.
all right, let's take a look. - All right.
Ooh. Okay. Does that hurt? - Ah. Yeah.
how did this happen?
I got dizzy, I fell, and hit my elbow on the table.
okay, does any of this hurt? - Mm-mm.
I did save kitty cat, though. - Who?
that's the name of my guitar.
Jerry Garcia called his "tiger."
so I decided... yeah. - So you call yours "kitty cat.
well, I'm, uh... I'm glad she survived the fall.
not that she's much use to a one-armed musician.
well, let's get you back up to two.
this aspiration should resolve the traumatic bursitis, and I think you'll be able to play tonight without a problem.
can you hold that down for me?
thank you.
Lance, have you had other dizzy spells?
nothing too unusual.
okay. Other injuries? Falls of any kind?
not unless you count when I was six and I fell off the jungle gym.
that's probably when I decided to be a musician, not an athlete.
and that's probably not the answer we're looking for, but I'd like to do a head C. T. just to be safe.
Why?
I just want to make sure your dizziness isn't something more serious.
do we really need to go there, doc?
it's not very far to go.
we can do it tonight before the party, our own little warm-up set.
how's that? Is that better?
wow, yeah. - Okay, good.
Hey. Appletini, please. - Yes, sir.
if anyone asks, though, it's a Midori Mojito.
what?
I didn't say anything. - Your judgment is deafening.
just say it. Just speak your mind.
okay.
if you're going to drink like a woman, own it like a man.
you must be really close with Divya.
um, I'm Emma.
Evan R. Lawson. Hi.
you live here, right?
no. I used to.
my wife and I just found our own place a few weeks ago.
Oh, right. Right.
I guess you have to leave the nest sometime.
Uh-huh. - Your dad must get really lonely living here all by himself.
my dad? Wow. That's precious.
my dad couldn't afford the cable bill here.
no, a man named Boris lives here, and my brother and I rent the guesthouse.
you know, it's a nice arrangement.
Oh, speak of the devil. My brother's right there.
nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too.
Yeah, I just want to drop my stuff off and get back to the party in time for Divya's dad's speech.
Wow. Love what you've done with the place.
what the hell have you done with it?
well, uh, according to the time-honored roommate code, if you leave without saying good-bye, you know, your roommate takes possession of all furniture and electronics and any hypothetical loose change that might be hiding between the sofa cushions, - even if it's a lot. - Evan, where is all our stuff?
Paige and I needed furniture, and furniture's really expensive, and you were off living the high life with Boris, so...
speaking of, how's he doing? Is he okay?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, he's, um...
he's doing well.
that's great. Is he... cured?
well, the trial isn't about curing the disease.
it's about delaying the onset of symptoms.
so this weekend is just another pit stop for you?
Mm-hmm. - Like last time?
okay, Lance, you can sit up now.
Yes.
so I don't know if you know how lucky you are uh, to have Hank taking care of you personally, but he's usually off jet setting with other patients.
Oh. - You can ask Hank about any medical problem, anything... anything in the world, like, anything in the universe.
he'll know how to fix it, like... - Okay, Ev, thanks for the plug.
babe, let's give the doctor and his patient some privacy...
what a wonderful idea.
so that Lance can pick Hank's huge, encyclopedic brain.
okay, thank you guys so much, really.
I am sorry about that.
I'm not sure why they're being so weird.
what are they usually like?
uh, well, Paige is usually normal.
actually, there is something I should probably tell you.
yeah?
I didn't just fall off that jungle gym when I was young.
my dad dropped me. - Oh.
it was the beginning of his Huntington's Disease.
you know that with Huntington's, there's a 50/50 chance of Inheriting it from an affected parent.
Yep, I know.
and once you get it, it's a death sentence.
my dad died less than ten years after his diagnosis.
there was so many things he never got a chance to do.
he didn't even have a bucket list.
Lance, have you taken the blood test to check for the genetic mutation?
no. And I won't.
I don't want a Huntington's diagnosis to control my life.
if I do, then the disease kills me before I even get sick.
well, the good news is that your C. T. is clean.
of course it is.
you're one of the ten best doctors in the Hamptons.
right.
bethenny, thanks for coming.
you kidding me? I wouldn't miss it for the world.
how do I win this thing?
Oh, it's about finding the guy who's your other half. There's no winning.
honey, you're telling me?
I'm going to get a drink at the bar.
you tell Charlie Brown, if he's interested, he can come find me.
okay. - Okay.
Hi.
does Charlie Brown go with Sally?
no. Linus. - What?
let's just dance. - Okay.
Evan's an idiot.
Oh, sorry. Are you looking for a debate?
he had no right to take you from Boris when I'm not even in labor.
boris is fine. I'm so happy I'm here.
and happy to come back again when it's time.
I wouldn't miss the birth of your baby for anything.
I'm going to be right next to you, watching her very first breath.
Mm. Well, it means a lot that you would make us a priority.
you are.
he's really talented. - He is, isn't he?
talented enough to play pretty much anywhere.
that's a bad thing?
it may be. Um, I'll be back.
Hey, sorry, man, no more requests for now.
just... just let us surprise you.
Oh. Uh, can I request speaking to Lance for a minute?
I'm a... I'm a friend of his.
Oh, so you want to go over my head?
no, no, no. That's... - That's all right.
I'll hook you up, man, if you want to hear it that bad. It's cool.
okay, thank you.
Lance, that was... I mean, that was really impressive.
Oh, I kind of botched that last stanza.
what? - Good thing the drinks are strong, right?
Lance, it was awesome...
so awesome, in fact, I got to ask, why are you playing a winter party at a summer resort when you could definitely be playing a sold-out L. A. arena?
this is a perfectly good gig.
Yeah, sure, but is it the gig you want?
you said you don't want to take the test 'cause you don't want Huntington's to control your life.
is it possible that not taking the test is controlling your life even more?
you've given me a lot to think about.
and I will, right after this next set.
okay, good.
thank you. - Yeah.
okay, I'm done being a groupie. How about a dance?
Hank, my water just broke.
almost there. It's right here.
now, Divya, you're sure this isn't Braxton Hicks?
Oh! Oh! - Okay, I get it! I get it! I get it!
Oh, my God.
I think we made a wrong turn into the Waldorf Astoria.
actually, the hospital gave Divya a courtesy upgrade.
Yeah, they did. Here we go. Easy, easy.
lights dimmed to 50%, please. - Check.
my iPod set to soothing playlist number one.
check.
all right, excuse me, folks.
I'm Tamara. - Okay.
here we go. Hi, Divya.
go ahead and scooch down and bend your knees for me, okay?
just let your legs fall apart, all right?
there we go. Wait a second. Wait a second.
it's coming right now? Right this moment?
it's coming out right now?
are you going to be a problem? Is he going to be a problem?
he might be. - Yeah.
we'll get the chocolate cigars. - Or a pacifier.
all right, just breathe.
you're going to feel a little bit of pressure.
Mm-hmm. - All right, there you go.
great. Very good.
okay, 7. - 1 centimeter.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but in my defense, your expectations are pretty high.
all right, you know, 1 centimeter.
only 9 more to go.
Hey, what made you hire Lance's band?
well, he's quite a find. Plus, he did kick off my labor, so Sashi and I figured that we owed him.
Yeah, Lance!
Hey, Lance, are you... - Yeah.
are you okay? - I'm great.
my degenerative terminal illness is just acting up a bit.
symptoms started shortly after I saw you last February.
that's a fast progression for three months.
what did Dr. Sacani say when he followed up with you?
uh, he referred me to a Huntington's specialist.
you were right last Valentine's about confronting the question.
so, when symptoms acted up shortly after that, I was... I was ready and not exactly surprised.
I'm just glad Divya liked the music enough to hire me back for this one.
Lance, I can help you navigate this disease.
Hey, man, you got a sec? - Yeah.
excuse me, Hank. The guys probably want to know why I was break-dancing during my solo.
Yeah. Okay.
it appears I've healed just as we expected.
Yeah, right.
you've made this a part of my official medical file, yes?
Yes, anyone who reviews your history will see what you're seeing now.
excellent. This puts us right on schedule for Monte Carlo.
sorry to interrupt.
we were just trying to find a place to have dinner.
we'll just find another room.
how long was she standing there?
I don't know. - Did she see the X-ray?
I don't know that either, but I'll talk to her.
don't talk to me. - Divya, it's been six hours, and you know that Pitocin is a normal, proven method of stimulating labor.
my baby will come when the time is... right!
okay, I just think you need... - Do... not... talk... to... me.
okay.
pitocin is not part of her birth plan.
God, I can't believe I missed three months of this.
motherhood comes so easily to you.
Oh, I assure you, it is not easy, but her smile makes it worth it. Mwah.
excuse me for one second, guys.
Hi. Hi. Miss Sashi Katdare, may I have this dance, please?
and she just stopped smiling.
Evan, Evan, all the girls want to dance with you.
I know, but I'm choosing you. Can I, please?
I promise to have her back by a reasonable hour.
watch this... master at work. - Okay.
give me 90 seconds.
big mistake.
he really has bonded with her.
he has. Hopefully, the next time I see her, she'll have a better date.
next time you see her, she may be going to prom.
I really am so sorry about the last time.
you don't have to apologize.
but I was wondering about Boris.
Oh.
I saw the X-ray that he was holding.
he's losing bone density, which could indicate he's becoming symptomatic.
Yeah, and... and I'm sorry if I misled you.
he just... he wants to keep this very quiet.
okay. - Okay? Thank you.
Hey. Oh, where did your friend go?
my friend? - Yeah.
the adorable young girl, Emma.
no. Emma said she was your friend.
she told me the same thing.
Emma told me she was a patient.
okay, don't worry, guys. I've got this covered.
Lance, are you okay?
I think I broke my hip. - Does your neck hurt?
no. - Okay.
Divya, maintain inline stabilization.
Lance, does that hurt? - No.
okay, how about that? - No.
his pulse is getting thready. - Okay.
this? - Oh!
okay, and here? - Amah!
okay, it's not his hip. He fractured his pelvis.
Evan? - 911, I know.
we need to stop the bleeding, or he could exsanguinate.
okay, we need to force his pelvic ring closed, now.
uh... This could work.
Amah! What's he doing?
are you making a circumferential compression binder?
I'm trying to, yeah.
okay. Jeremiah, can you hold that tight? Thank you.
this should work. Sorry, kitty cat.
good.
okay, Lance? - Yeah.
this is going to hurt. - Okay.
okay.
pulse is steadying. - Good. Good.
what's going to happen to me?
okay, the bad news is you'll need emergency angiography with embolization and then pelvic surgery to repair the break.
is there any good news? - There may be.
Lance, did you ever actually see that specialist Dr. Sacani referred you to?
and you never took the genetic test?
Why? To confirm the obvious? - No, to rule it out.
Lance, I don't think you have Huntington's Disease.
will you give us a minute please?
is she armed? - No.
on any drugs? - We don't believe so.
then I will be fine.
I know why you're here.
and you're probably going to be really bummed when I tell you that the man you're looking for is not.
Yeah, I already found that out.
it was a long trip for nothing.
even a short trip to find a famous person seems a little silly.
he's more than just a famous person to me, and I'm more than just a fan.
have you ever even met him?
no, that's the whole point.
well, these nice gentlemen will be happy to drive you wherever you'd like to go, and I am sure with time, you will outgrow this little obsession that you have.
but, please...
don't come near me or my family ever again, because the next time, these gentlemen will not be as nice, and nor will I.
she's all yours.
Hey, Lance. - Hey.
did you get your pelvis fixed, or are you just happy to see us?
am I happy to see you?
so, Lance, the angiogram shows your symptoms have been caused by moyamoya, which is Japanese for "puff of smoke.
Wow. One more reason to quit.
uh, no, it's not actual smoke.
it's a bunch of small blood vessels that form to compensate for a blockage in the carotid artery.
how did you figure it was moyamoya?
well, during your solo, I saw you not getting enough oxygen, and hypoxia is not a symptom of Huntington's, so...
so what caused the blockage?
hard to say for sure, but it might have formed when your dad dropped you from the jungle gym.
so I did get a condition from my father.
speaking of which...
your blood work came back.
now, I just need to confirm that you want the result of your Huntington's test.
I do. - Okay.
Wow.
Wow.
thank you, Hank.
really.
I was so sure I had it, I...
I avoided the opportunity to be proven wrong.
and in the process, I avoided a lot of other opportunities too.
well, you just need a procedure to correct the blockage, and after that I can finally pursue the career I want.
so the next time the piano man calls...
Kitty cat and I will answer.
about kitty cat, uh, medically speaking, she didn't fare quite as well as you.
Oh, no. Well, she had a good run.
she did. She did.
Oh, hey. - Hey.
why'd you, uh, step out?
I just wanted to give a doctor and his patient some privacy, you know.
Oh, well, thank you.
good thing for him you were around.
Yeah, well, you know, I caught a lucky break.
don't worry. That was just a compliment.
that was not me trying to get you to stick around like before, okay?
no, I... - No, I get it.
you... you're a different kind of doctor now.
it's... it's cool.
no, that's not true, Ev. I'm not.
you should take it. It's probably someone important.
dilated to 5 centimeters.
at least there's progress. - Yeah.
but the baby's now in the occiput posterior position, and as you well know, delivering sunny-side up can be very risky.
Divya, it's been nine hours. You have a slight fever.
I really think you need to consider... - Divya has a very specific birth plan.
okay, well, sometimes plans have to change.
I'd like to try different laboring positions to adjust the baby.
okay.
I'll be back in a few hours, then.
okay.
Hank, just take the call. - No, no, no, I can't leave now.
unfortunately, this is going to be a while.
okay, okay. - Mm-hmm.
yeah?
Oh, easy.
uh, now... now rotate your hips.
maybe more like you're hula-hooping.
I've never used a hula hoop.
me neither.
a wire must have come loose.
no, the baby's heart rate is dropping.
is dropping to what? - It's...
the baby is in distress, and your B. P. is dropping.
a placental abruption? - It's possible.
let's get that C-section now.
there's a lot happening here too, so just tell me what's going on.
it's begun. I've broken my leg.
you broke it now?
wait a second. Is this... are you sure?
Hank, it's broken.
o...
okay.
okay, I can be on the jet tomorrow.
make it tonight, please.
no, Boris, I said tomorrow, and I really can't sit here arguing with you about it.
I think I made myself quite clear.
Yeah, you have.
Tamara! - She's in the O. R...
emergency C-section.
here is your perfect baby.
Oh, my God! - Hi.
so bald die art bereit it.
where is your bag?
I can't come to terms with leaving again.
you made a commitment to me, Hank, and we have a very specific plan.
sometimes plans have to change.
I'll still fly to wherever I need to continue administering the monthly dose of your trial medication.
it's not just about the trial. And you know it.
I do...
which is why I should've stayed behind the last time.
is this about your patients here?
it's about them and much more.
I don't want to be a helicopter physician anymore.
you can be any kind of physician you like after we've fulfilled our objectives.
I'll see you on board. We leave in ten minutes.
come to terms with that however you like.
I mean, look... - I can't look, 'cause I'm trying to look at the ball, okay?
don't get me wrong. I'm... - Okay.
I'm thrilled you're back.
I just want to know why you changed your mind.
helping Lance made me remember what I've been missing.
good.
what about Boris?
he's a patient too. He's the patient.
he's top priority around here, right?
Yeah, Boris is a complicated man.
that's a groundbreaking insight.
thank you.
I'm going to more beer now.
maybe if I get you drunk,
I'll get a straight answer out of you.
mama? - Hmm?
I'll be back. - Okay, baby.
so...
I had a major epiphany. - Yeah? When?
over the winter? - No, just now in the kitchen.
Oh, you found beer and enlightenment.
I realized it doesn't matter about Boris.
I'm just happy the family's back together.
Yeah. - We're together.
you and me are back together again.
things are finally back to normal around here.
to normal.
in fact, I'm ready for that "welcome home" hug.
actually, I'm good now, but thank you.
Ah, come on.
I missed you, bro.
I missed you too, but this is as long as it should be, I think.
two more seconds.
okay.
and I'm... - Make that six.
I'm really... I'm good. - Make that eight.
all right.
what are you doing here?
funny, I was just about to ask you the same thing.
I thought you knew why I was here.
I thought so too, but you're not Rafa's stalker, are you?
stalker? What? Who's Rafa?
Emma, who were you looking for today at Shadow Pond?
I was looking for my father.
your father?
well, who is your father?
Hey. - Oh, hey.
what's going on?
Hank, this is Emma.
Hi.
the famous/notorious Emma.
I've heard many different things about you.
well, Emma has another one to add to the list... the truth.
I'm Hank.
I was your typical emergency room doctor... until I got fired.
you let a billionaire hospital trustee die to save some kid off the street.
I made a judgment call. - You made a mistake.
this is my brother.
I'm Evan R. Lawson, C.P.A.
he took me away from my troubles and to the Hamptons, and suddenly, I had a chance to become a whole new kind of doctor.
turns out the wealthy and not-so-wealthy out here could use a guy who makes house calls, so I got a second chance to do what I do best.
all right, I got half-naked plates here.
I've got risotto without bucatini, orzo polpo without orzo.
be careful! Christopher.
pizza... get this...pizza out.
pizza?
you asked for pasta.
Yeah, that's what I said-- peppers, pickles, pie crusts.
pasta, bucatini orzo.
well, what, is everybody on break?
come on, let's go. Let's get back to work.
Valentina, the pappardelle. Yeah?
you're up early.
I know.
well, I figure-- if I'm going to expand Hankmed's clientele, I got to join a country club.
cause that's where they keep all the rich people out here.
and I can't join a club until I have a sport.
a, uh--a networking milieu, if you will.
I won't. Bam.
did Boris say you could use his tennis equipment?
you said--I'm going to quote you right now-- you said that unless it's an emergency, leave Boris alone.
Yeah, including all of his property, facilities, and leisure gear.
interesting, I must've tuned that part of the lecture out.
fine.- Thank you.
all right, cover for me till I get back.- Sure.
and don't change my ringtone to you rapping, no crank calls, no pizza deliveries.
charitable donations?- No, nothing.
okay.
we have to discuss Sunday.
I... Hank fest, man. That's a working title, by the way.
it's a bad title, and I don't want to discuss Sunday.
that's too bad. I already made ressies at the seven hottest clubs in the Hamptons, with, like, cabanas and bottle service.
and I rented us a limo with a scent machine in it.
I have no idea what that is, but I got a really good deal.
Evan, I'm serious.
my wedding was canceled, remember?
what do you mean do I--of course I remember.
it doesn't mean that any and all festivities associated with it have to be canceled. Come on.
Hank palooza! Yes, Hank palooza, that's perfect.
wait. How about nothing-palooza?
honestly, henry, and I mean this...- yeah?
I'm not gonna let you spend your ex-wedding day moping around.
I'm not gonna do it. So you got to do something.
I think I'll just take Sunday off.
you know, no moping, just some peace and quiet.
Oh, my god.
Evan... You would've made a great best man.
1986 called. It wants its shorts back.
I missed laundry day this week. Cut me some slack.
Hankmed, good morning. And how can we make you feel better today?
tuberculosis tests?
uh, yes, of course we can deal with that.
how many employees?
great, how does--how does 1: 30 sound?
amazing. Okay. So I just need to get your address?
Hey, thank you for coming on such short notice.
of course.
this new requirement by the health department must have every restaurant scrambling.
you have no idea.
so, uh, what happens next?
we'll come back in a couple of days to check the injection sites.
if anyone has TB, their forearms will turn red and flare up.
so, uh, this soup is very provocative.
do you embrace customer feedback?
I'm sure does--from paying customers.
you, I like.
can I talk to you in private?
Yeah, sure. You're done. Thanks.
Hello, valentina.
can you please push up your left sleeve?
I don't speak English good.
Oh, um... but you know about the TB shot?
wow, you are really happy to be talking... about everything.
Valentina.
health department.
berlitz lessons.
I had a major crush on this Italian bartender once.
she was so hot.
Evan, I don't care right now.- All right.
it's never happened before, and it hasn't happened since.
I'm sure it was scary.
tell me, are you on any meds?
just birth control.
I'm really glad you could come on short notice, because I wanted to know what happened to me, and I don't need anyone else knowing.
well, if you were worried about privacy, I could've met you at your home.
this is my home.
I'm here from dawn to2: 00 A. M. seven days a week.
so... What do you think?
okay, well, it could be a lot of things-- hypoglycemia, a seizure, bell's palsy.
it could also be a complex migraine, a T.I.A.
what's that?
transient ischemic attack, it's a mini-stroke.
very quick, no permanent damage.
what else?
well, it could benothing at all.
Oh, nothing? I'll take that.
I'm sure you will.
so listen, you should get a full physical and a neurological exam.
I can help set it up.
after Labor Day, when things slow down.
thank you so much for everything, doc.
you have got a table on the house anytime.
Allison, you need for things to slow down now.
if you did have a T.I.A. And it remains untreated, you could be at risk for a major stroke.
it won't be quick, and there will be permanent damage.
I started the last restaurant I had with my husband.
and one day... he just walked out, and he took the evening hostess with him and all of my recipes.
he took everything.
and now, finally, I have something again, - so... - so protect it, Allison.
one day of routine tests, it's very simple.
I'll leave this room when you say yes.
Yes.- Thank you.
you're lucky I like tough love.
all right. So, um, I'll call you in a week.
great.
Oh, this sauce.
Valentina. Taste that.
come on, people. This isn't a food court.
spaghettini with filet mignon meatballs.
here, take a bite, Divs.
the name is Divya.
that was cranky.
does the doctor's little helper need a power nap or something?
doctor's little helper?- Yeah.
while I may not have gone to medical school,
I do hold a license as a certified physician assistant, which means I practice medicine.
I can prescribe drugs, perform exams and procedures, interpret diagnostic tests, and assist in surgery.
you definitely need... something.
you know what I need?
I need some boundaries.
boundaries? What's that supposed to mean?
you set those tb tests at the most illogical time.
what?- While the restaurant was serving, evan.
and then you ran around like a little Yorkie yapping at everyone, begging for treats, practically humping my leg while I'm trying to administer the shots.
okay, so I'd also like some boundaries, starting with the kinds of animals you're allowed to compare me to.
and you know what? Since you brought it up, how do you see my rolein Hankmed?
why don't you just stay at shadow pond and crunch the numbers?
in the field, you are simply a distraction.
well, Hankdoesn't seem to think so.
he is probably numb to you by now.
well, let's ask him. He's right behind you.
Hey, everything okay?
terrific.
I, uh, set the follow-up for Sunday-- only day you're free.
actually, no, he's not free on Sunday.
he's taking a me day.
me meaning him, not me.
Yeah, it's true. You mind handling this one solo?
I'd be happy to.
it's my job.
great. I'm gonna grab some lunch.
seeing your swan of spaghettini made me hungry.
are we done? - Yep.
how are you?
good. Is the, uh, hospital coffee really that bad?
Oh, officially speaking? No, it's delicious.
but off the record... - you could remove nail polish with it.
exactly.
I only bought this to, uh, try out my new cup holders.
wait, is this yours?
where's-- yeah.
Yeah, after 12 years and 217, 000 miles, Greta just stopped.
the mechanic found a "do not resuscitate" card in the glove box.
that's just too bad.
I mean, now you can't cool down with the top down.
you want cool?
the solar panels on my roof actually cool down the car.
eh, I like the wind in my hair, but I'm old school.
shall I walk you to work?
all right, old school.
so, uh... Did you get my message?- I did.
nice outgoing message, by the way.
Yeah, yours too, very hospital chic.
that is so not a compliment.
you're lucky if I go out with you now.
any, uh--any plans tonight?
late staff meeting. Tomorrow?
uh, let me just check.
no, I have two, um, NCMS.
that's Evan-speak for "new client meetings." How about monday?
budget review. Tuesday?
Yeah. No. More NCMs. How about Wednesday?
yet another staff meeting.
um, this Sunday looks good.
Sunday morning?
okay, um... yeah, I'm pretty open late in the week.
no, no. Let's do it sunday.
are you sure? - Yeah.
Hi, I'm Divya Katdare with Hankmed.
I'm here for the tb follow-up.
Oh, how you doing? Um, Lucas Gordon.
uh, no reaction, see? - Great.
I have some paper work for Allison.
can you tell me where she is?
we should try to hurry, and not just cause it's freezing in here.
this is the only place we could have privacy.
and you know what? Try not to hurry.
my shift starts at 11: 00, I got to do my prep.
consider this your prep.
you really are the best boss ever.
my arm--my arm's numb.
hey... what's wrong?
what are we doing in here?
Allison, we always do it in here.
Hey, what's going on?
are you okay?
found your networking milieu yet?
not yet, no.
uh, have fun at Sunday brunch, by the way.
Aw, you're bitter about Hank palooza.
no.
no, I'm not bitter, not at all, man.
Hank-o-rama. Hankstock!
stop doing bad things to my name.
look, Jill and I are just getting together today because
it's your only mutually available time slot for the next couple of weeks.
I completely understand that.
but honestly, though, brunch?
what's wrong with brunch?
it's brunch. You're wearing clothes, so it's not breakfast.
you're not even that hungry yet, so it's not lunch, it's like--it's the meal that won't commit.
it's the--come to think of it, it's the perfect meal for you and Jill.
so enjoy a French toast salad or whatever.
I'm sorry, was there something else?
we have a good thing going here, Evan.
just remember that.
God.
what the hell?
great, thank you.
Yes, I remember the nose ring.
I had one for a few hours while I was at university-- too many margaritas.
okay, thank you.
Oh, wait, miss Litelli... can you please tell me where I might find Valentina?
I don't think she's working today.
Oh, really? I thought I saw you talking with her earlier.
you must've confused her with someone else.
in fact, I know I saw the two of you together.
what I don't know is why you're lying for her now.
and what you apparently don't know is that defrauding the health department in any way--is a very big deal.
I have to finish my prep.
tell me where Valentina went.
tell me, or I'll call the health department.
Yes, Mrs. Franklin?
the farmers market--you should find her there.
thank you.
I need to confirm my nail appointment.
what exactly is happening here?
our reservation was 45 minutes ago, which is how long that table's been empty for.
phone call.
this close, huh?
how far back do you and Allison go, exactly?
a couple of days, but long days.
take it- Okay.
Hello?
uh, excuse me.
this really isn't a good time. Can we talk later?
I don't know exactly when. What do you...?
no, I'm okay.
I'm really good, actually.
Yes, of course I remember.
but honestly, Nikki, I'm trying to forget, and maybe you should too.
no, look, I can't do that--I got to go. I got to go. Bye. Bye.
everything okay?
okay, so that was my... ex-fiancee.
okay. When was the "ex" added?
a few weeks ago.
and when was the wedding?
some time around...right now.
now?
look, I was gonna tell you all about it, which I will do, over a drink, if we ever get a table.
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me one sec.
Hey, Allison. I stopped by for that table you offered me.
I'm sorry, have we met?
Yeah.
I'm hank. Dr. Lawson.
um, I'm sorry.
I don't recognize you.
do you recognize her?
call 911. I think she's had a stroke.
so the stroke induced the amnesia.
a CT scan will tell us if it's hemorrhagic or thrombotic.
well, what's the difference in treatment?
if it's hemorrhagic, it'll depend on how much brain damage she's already suffered.
and if it's thrombotic? -There won't be any brain damage.
she can get thrombolytics, which can help break up the clot.
but there's a catch, we'd only have a three-hour window to administer these meds.
but we don't know when the stroke occurred.
no. So even in the best-case scenario, we're already running out of time.
gently, gently.
I'll see if I can find her a bed.
Dr. Dern, and you are?
my doctor. -Yeah, Hank Lawson.
look at me, please.
who are you? What are you doing?
it's okay, Allison. You're safe.
Allison Moore, she presented to me about 20 minutes ago with confusion towards self, place, and date.
I believe she's a candidate for stroke protocol.
I'll call for a neurology consult.
no, I think she needs a CT scan first.
what time was the stroke?
I don't know, I asked everyone I could before the EMT showed up.
radiology.
okay-- -doctor. I'm sorry. You know the rules.
unless you're familyor have privileges here, this is as far as you go.
Hank, Hank, please don't leave me.
I'll be right here, Allison.
excuse me. Valentina!
I need to talk to you.
what?
he bought a mermaid?
holy shark.
I need to check your arm.
Valentina, this is serious.
it'll just take a moment, okay?
Oh, no.
all right, does anyone speak Italian?
Valentina, wait!
so there's your 10-foot sand tiger shark, a voracious eater and predator.
how long was your journey?
60 hours.
she was in tonic immobility?
upside down-- natural state of paralysis the entire time.
she'll do well here.
for your services, Mr. Hogan.
and... for your discretion.
Cheers.
thank you.
all right, mate.
you satisfied with her?
she's exactly what I need.
I should let Katie know.
Hey, just got your message.
sorry to bother you on your me day, but we may have a situation.
what kind of situation?
one of the cooks had a rather large reaction to the TB test.
did you get a sputum sample?
I couldn't. She ran away from me.
well, she could start an epidemic, Divya.
don't worry. I have a plan.
I have to go. -Hank, wait.
one question.
do you know where Evan is?
no, no idea. I've been at Hampton's heritage. Allison had a stroke.
Oh, my god. Is she okay?
I wish I knew. Uh, talk soon.
Hey, you work with Allison, right?
there's a rumor she had a stroke.
it's more than a rumor. Sorry, look, I don't have a lot of time.
Allison may not have a lot of time.
do you have any information that can help her?
look, I'm only interested in what's medically relevant, because the medicinethat can help her must be given within a three-hour period.
do you know when she started acting unusual?
she definitely wouldn't want me talking about that.
Yeah, she would, because she could die if you don't.
we were in the walk-in.
it's where we always, um... you know.
right afterward.
it was weird.
she was weird.
okay, when exactly was this?
sex can be a trigger for a stroke.
I need to know what time the clock started.
right before my shift at 11: 00.
okay, thank you.
note to self-- get a car, preferably one with doors.
I've got a problem. Meet me at 23 foxtail court as soon as possible.
Evan, please. I need you.
to save this message, press 9.
uh, not only did I save that message, I put it on my ipod as workout music.
so, uh, why don't you tell me a little bit more about these needs of yours, the needs that youseem to be experiencing?
remember the woman from the restaurant?
the one who speaks Italian?
Yes, Valentina. She's totally hot.
I need you to translate.
okay, yeah, I'd be-- I'd be happy to provide my aiuto.
that means "help" in Italian, by the way.
but in return, since you know everybody around here, you can give me the lowdown on Boris.
Divya, you do not know what I just saw-- -nor do I care.
Valentina may have TB.
I'm not getting a disease. Are you kidding me?
especially one I didn't have any fun catching.
we'll talk through the door or a window, okay?
you'll be perfectly safe.
fine! I'll tell you everything, everything you want to know about Boris Kuestervon Jurgens-Ratenicz.
well...
Okeydoke.
one second!
quick, Evan--Evan, tell her she's done nothing wrong.
uh, maybe something got lost in translation.
the radiologist said the CT scan confirmed a thrombotic stroke.
well, we have until 2: 00 P. M. to give her the meds, so... should be enough time.
are you sure this is her room?
positive.
Where's the patient?
you don't know?
she was here 20 minutes ago.
her street clothes are gone.
I'll see if anyone's seen her.
this is Jill Casey... -doctor Dern!
can you get me some thrombolytics? -Sure.
how much time do we have?
less than 30 minutes to find her and save her.
search again. Check the bathrooms.
well, look, if she does show up, call me.
she's not in the hospital. -She's not at her restaurant.
we'll go to her house.
and this is all she needs?
Yeah, as long as she gets it in the next 25 minutes.
quick, tell her I need to check her arm.
okay, tell her it won't take long.
uh... ask her if this hurts and if she's noticed any blood or drainage coming from the area.
okay...
okay, what'd she say?
she's-- okay, now she's-- now she's just showing off.
okay, now she's talking about the things she loves the most.
like cooking her... kid?
Oh, she loves cooking and her kid.
she has a little boy. She's talking about him.
she really needs her job.
okay, okay... ask her if her arm is tight.
you know, if the skin won't stretch.
she's still talking.
Divya-- Divya, I can't work like this.
Evan, she reacted to the test. I need samples.
Valent- Valentina-- she just keeps talking about italy.
of course, of course.
it all makes sense now.
Yeah, maybe to you.
Allison! It's Hank!
you there? Allison?
I'll check the back door.
don't bother. She's not here. She's never here. Come on.
wait, how do you know?
because she told me.
wait, what did she tell you?
Allison's home isn't her house.
her home is where she really lives.
and where's that? -Come on.
okay, so now I'm really confused.
you're--you're gonna give her an X-ray?
a chest X-ray, yes.
tell her, and I'll explain why to you later.
you're gonna give her a chest X-ray on her arm?
like, how are you even gonna do that?
she's gonna lean out through the window?
of course not. I'm going inside.
you're gonna what?
you're just gonna risk infection?
I have a hunch the risk is low.
I'll be back in five.
you have "a hunch" you're not gonna get tuberculosis?
man, I should stay out of the field.
Evan, a little help, please.
I don't think I explained the chest X-ray thing very well.
tell her the scar on her arm is from her BCG vaccine.
what is that?
it's a TB inoculation done outside the U. S. in places like Italy.
okay, so when people come here and they have the BCG vaccine and they get the TB test, the results will almost always be a false positive.
thus, her arm.
that's what got lost in translation.
tell her.
mm, it's completely clear.
she's gonna be fine.
well, tell her everything she needs to know.
so I'm not done with you.
about our deal...
Oh...now?
Oh, yeah.
okay, uh...Boris.
gosh, Evan, he's very... private.
Yeah, I know that.
And?
well, that's all I've got.
what do you mean that's all you've got?
you lying... manipulative... ponzi schemer.
I thought you had details about Boris.
and I thought you knew Italian.
but her staff said she wasn't here.
she will be--dawn till 2: 00, seven days a week.
and I think I know where.
I bet she went back to where the stroke began.
excuse me, could you help clear this table, please?
thank you.
okay, I need tin foil, aluminum foil. Rip them, let's go.
big strips. Blankets, okay.
I got your call.
uh, Jill, Divya. Divya, Jill.
Divya, I want you to take that bag. I want you to put it in the hot water.
can I borrow this, please?
her core temp must be below 89. 6. Any luck with the hair dryer?
got it. -Great.
plug that into there.
okay, turn it on.
home-made bair hugger.
okay, let's start the IVS.
Saline's ready.
do you have a pulse? -Weak, but steady. Her temperature's rising.
okay, let me see the thrombolytics.
wait, what are you doing?
getting them prepped.
you can't. We're past the window.
what, it's been more than three hours?
Yes, but the cold slowed her metabolism and bought us some time.
she could have a major brain bleed if you use a blood thinner now.
isn't the three-hour limit nonnegotiable?
at a hospital. But we're not in a hospital.
if we were, we'd be required to sit back and do nothing.
but she needs this to save her life, and I'm giving it to her.
should I have updated my will?
Evan Richard Lawson, certified public accountant.
you know we've met, right?
are you an intelligent man, Mr. Lawson?
well, I... I shouldn't have trespassed.
it was silly. I wasn't thinking about it.
and... I'm really sorry.
it's only trespassing if you violated my privacy.
was my privacy violated?
it was.
are you certain of that?
Yeah.
because I saw your... -yes?
you know, the--the
what did you see?
you know, the... big...
it appears that Evan R. Lawson, CFO, is quickly outshining Evan R. Lawson, CPA.
I didn't see anything.
so my privacy wasn't violated?
No! Not at all.
then nor will yours be.
going down.
so I finally slowed down for you.
I'm glad you remember we talked about that.
now you have to do it.
Valentina.
don't look that happy. I'm gonna be back soon.
your ristorante is safe with me.
see you soon.
okay, guys.
talk to you later. -Good work, Divya.
nice meeting you. -Take care.
you took a big risk to save that woman.
maybe now we can get a decent table.
to Allison.
to Valentina.
and to two more checks in the mail.
Cheers. Cheers. -Salute.
so, uh, we're gonna start with the calamari and the hot pickled peppers.
no, we decided on the prosciutto de parma.
that's what you decided.
actually, it's what we both decided.
but-- not me.
hello.
to thank you.
and tell everybody I am now sous chef.
Congratulations.
Valentina...
she's pretty.
thank you very much.
you're leaving?
I have other plans.
you made this reservation.
Yeah, for you guys.
differences are always easier to settle over a good meal.
no, you-- Hank. You're kidding me.
you know, Divya... we did crack that TB case wide open.
we?
Yeah, like a team.
here's an idea-- let's have dinner, but absolutely no conversation.
Yeah, like we're married.
don't panic. I'm not here to work. I'm here to eat.
you're lucky. I hear the food is great.
I am lucky. I'm very lucky.
thank you.
you got it.
you know, back at the restaurant, after we found her in the freezer, it looked pretty grim there for a few moments.
I know. I'm glad Allison's gonna be okay.
Yeah, thanks to you.
well... what was she thinking?
I don't think she was thinking about much. She had a stroke.
no, I-I meant Nikki.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
no, no, it's cool.
I just-- I thought it was more of a down-the-road conversation.
you want to stall?
no, I don't want to stall.
I just want to be able to carefully articulate my-- yeah, I want to stall.
but look, now that it's out there,
I should never have asked you out on my wedding day
my ex-wedding day.
it's okay.
I know what it's like to be living your plan "B."
you do?
I was engaged once too.
so you broke yours off also?
no, I- I went through with it.
but, you know, it just didn't work out, so I started from scratch.
okay, I get it. You don't want to talk about your ex.
no, no, it's not that. It's just, no, it's--yeah. No, you want to stall.
no, it's not that. It's just that... you and I-- we just started seeing each other, and... well, he, um... it's... it's just complicated.
and, you know--yeah, I want to stall.
look, I get it. Relationships are all about timing.
no, I completely agree.
so where does that leave us?
I guess we just take things slow.
I could do slow.
Yeah, not rush into anything.
Absolutely.
we can stall.
stall. Good plan.
I'm Hank.
I was your typical emergency room doctor. Until I got fired.
you let a billionaire hospital trustee die to save some kid off the street.
I made a judgment call.
you made a mistake.
this is my brother. I'm Evan R. Lawson, C.P.A.
he took me away from my troubles and to the Hamptons.
and suddenly, I had a chance to become a whole new kind of doctor.
turns out the wealthy and not so wealthy out here could use a guy who makes house calls.
so I got a second chance to do what I do best.
obviously, there has to be something else.
it's just not name change and arrested!
there has to be something else.
mm, god, this is such good television.
isn't it your job to sort through company email?
there is no email on Sundays.
I think you're thinking of mail.
uh, I think it's my job. I should know.
you look cozy over there. Can I get you anything else?
cucumber eye pads, a Chinese foot rub?
I am finally starting to feel at home around here.
Oh, yeah? Oh, good.
cause I was worried whether you'd survive the adjustment to all this.
I think I've earned a day off, Hank.
cash flow is up 25%, fixed costs are down 10%, we have a healthy reserve, and I finally started to put our capital to work for us.
is it working as hard as you?
it's working.
I'm investing our way towards a bigger business and a higher life, Hank.
pretty soon, Boris is gonna be living in our guest house.
Yeah, you might want to explain all that to our medical supplier.
apparently, the check you wrote them for our new portable EKG machine just bounced.
Yeah, well... you see, this is why you never read company emails on Sundays, okay?
I'm gonna be reading up on Boris.
fix this, Evan.
all right, I'm all over it. Trust me. First thing tomorrow morning.
and don't wait till tomorrow.
so I know you're busy studying 100 years of German medical data, but, uh, there actually is one Hankmed concern that's been on my mind today.
spokes model, corporate jet, or commercial during the super bowl?
none of the above. It's Divya.
what about her?
should we discuss what our plan is?
our plan is to talk to her, see what her plan is.
okay, but what if she decides to do this?
if she gets engaged and moves to London, what are we gonna do?
well, we'll find another P.A. I guess.
so you're not worried at all?
I said we'd find another P.A.
I didn't say we'd find another Divya.
hill manor. Sound like a serious joint.
you fired up for the social event of the season, henry?
where are you going this time, huh?
Zoey, honey, let's get you back to bed.
Zoey? Honey?
no, Zoey, stop!
as we discussed, a full service bar will be set up there, in the courtyard...
and out there, on the great lawn, next to the ceremony tents.
no one will be waiting for drinks.
also, the dance floor will be up here in the courtyard.
crazy wedding here last night?
just a small maintenance operation.
what kind of operation?
we're cleaning the manor house.
we're cleansing the manor house.
I'm sorry?
look, Ms. Katdare, we promise everything will be back to normal in time for your party.
Zoey, why don't you show them the great lawn?
I was just about to.
um, Divya, a word, please.
are you thinking what I'm thinking?
right. So...
but maybe the Montauk yacht club has a last-minute cancellation.
I'll call the event manager there.
you resume the tour of Amityville.
this place seemed so normal when my sister got married here three years ago.
Hi, um, I was wondering if you had space for a last-minute event.
let's talk about this later.
sorry about that.
no, please, look, Ms. Katdare, we will have everything cleaned up in time for your very special occasion.
you and Mr. Bandyopadhyay seem like the perfect couple, and you deserve a truly perfect affair.
should we continue walking?
are you okay down there?
Oh, yeah, it's...it's no big deal.
may I?
it's no small deal.
okay, neither is that.
have you seen a doctor?
Oh, the cough. Yeah, it comes and goes.
and this just happened last night.
well, let's pause the party planning for a moment. Shall we?
So...how did this happen, Zoey?
it's gonna sound very strange.
the house is doing this to her.
one more time.
every night, I see things.
Really...indescribable things.
and last night, I followed one of them right through that window.
and why would the house be making this happen?
well, Amy thinks it's because I want to expand.
turn this place into a full service bed and breakfast.
and the house wants you to stay focused on events and catering.
this house has been in our family for five generations.
ever since our great, great grandparents came here from Scotland and built it with their bare hands.
Amy... any radical change to that now would be an insult to them and what they left behind.
my sister's a little off center sometimes.
Oh, I know how you feel. My brother couldn't find the center with a G.P.S. Device.
how long has this been going on?
a couple weeks.
you've been hallucinating every night for two weeks, and you haven't seen a doctor?
let me take the sharps.
thank you.
there are two options here.
either my sister's right, or I'm losing my mind.
I don't think I could handle finding out either one is true.
look no one should have to feel like they're crazy or, even worse, like their sibling was right about something.
I personally don't have much experience with the latter, but I imagine the pain is unbearable.
excruciating.
so... we better find you a third option.
no signs of papilledema, so probably no increased intracranial... no abnormality of the soft palate muscles.
no masses in the neck or thyroid.
deep breath in. Out.
lungs, heart, abdomen are normal.
count backwards from 100 by sevens.
93, 86, 79, 72 -okay, no cognitive impairment.
no explanation for the odd mixture of coughing and hallucinating.
time to take it up a notch.
I'll get a CT scanner over here.
you're on the cutting edge of home security, Jill.
you gonna detain me in a bucket till the cops arrived?
what are you doing in my house?
Doro alicha.
ethiopian chicken stew. It's traditional, but lively.
I'm not hungry. -Mm, I am.
you know, ever since I, spent my life savings treating indigent peoples across the planet,
I came back and had to crash at the hospital.
you been sleeping there?
Oh, yeah, and as much as I love the amenities, found myself craving a home cooked meal.
so I couldn't help but wonder, why not live at home?
uh, because this isn't your home anymore.
check the mortgage agreement. -Check the mortgage payments.
listen... I know I owe you some money.
but here I am, working it off.
Plus, wouldn't it be easier for us to... attend to all our social obligations if we were under one roof?
Oh, my motorcycle's acting up.
you're, um, you're gonna have to drive us.
Yeah, I'll be attending this party solo.
thought you said you were open to a resolution.
Yeah, not when you force feed me.
look, Charlie, a lot happened after you left. I moved on.
Jill, a man, uh... travels the world in search of what he needs.
and then he returns home to find it.
so you sort it out all you want, 'cause when you're done, I'm gonna be right here...
showing you just how different things are gonna be this time around.
well, CT was clean.
no bleeds or lesions. Electrolytes are normal, and sugar's 102.
she's slightly anemic. But that's nothing abnormal for a 29 year old woman.
I think we need to look into environmental toxins or an infectious source.
given her sister's beliefs, should we be looking at psychiatric disease?
maybe something genetic.
look, I checked. No family history. Let's rule out all organic causes first.
after all, except for the coughing, Zoey looks fine right now. No hallucinations at all.
good, I'll get these to the lab. -Good.
hallucinations?
that's the clinical term, yes.
that's the unenlightened term.
well, enlighten me, please.
20 years ago, we lost our parents to an accident... to a drunk driver out on Montauk highway.
the very next day, I woke up and felt their presence.
this is gonna sound strange to you, but I could hear them speaking.
that's what got me through it.
and... I'm what got Zoey through it.
okay, and what do you think is happening here?
she's being haunted by her own instincts.
this house is sacred. And she should know it.
I have a proposal, Amy.
you stay open minded to my theories, and I'll stay open minded to yours.
okay, here's my theory.
Zoey will be fine as soon as she gives up her plan to turn our family's home into a bunch of rooms for rent.
what's your theory? -I don't have one yet.
but Zoey asked me to find one, and I won't give up until I do.
someone close to you. Someone who looks like you.
someone with a letter "R."
my brother. Evan R. Lawson?
he's getting himself into trouble.
sorry, Amy, you don't need a gift to sense that one.
sir, I'm telling you it's a clerical error. Okay, it's a big one.
I'm the CFO of the company. I didn't conduct or approve any of these withdrawals or transfers.
well, of course you can do something. You're the bank manager.
Yes, I'll hold again. Awesome.
cause when all my money's missing, there's nothing I enjoy more than the musical stylings of Ms. Liza Minnelli.
straight to voice mail. Okay.
so I see you're ignoring my calls now. That's interesting. we need to talk.
my account's been depleted by someone who had access to all my personal information.
so, uh, any ideas who that would be? Call me back, right now.
Hey. -Hey.
how's work going?
work is good. Thanks.
did we get those supplies Divya ordered?
Yeah, they're right there. -Okay.
how much do they c... what are they for again?
I got to go check for mold at the house of a hallucinating woman.
Oh, wow, that sounds dangerous. Should we be charging her a premium for that, or what? No.
but I should start getting paid extra to deal with overbearing siblings.
mine and hers. She's got this psychic sister.
Really? She's psychic? Hope she didn't put a 1900number on the contact sheet.
actually, all she said was that you're in some kind of trouble.
that's so weird.
you know what? Actually, that mold thing sounds dangerous.
I'm gonna come and help you out, hank, okay?
okay, here's the deal.
two weeks, max.
no matter what happens as far as us, start looking for your own place today.
that's aggressive, but reasonable.
and... you will stay in the guest room.
what if, um -at all times.
and last, but not least of the ground rules, get your motorcycle fixed, because this whole ride share to the hospital is a one time event.
I'm thinking about getting a car.
sounds like progress.
I'm thinking about picking up one of these intelligent parking assist.
Yeah, practically parks itself.
well, that does sound like progress.
cause you parallel parking that green Saab that was always a bit of an extreme sport for you.
Yeah, well, sadly for you, Charlie, I've moved on.
I think you have a habit of moving on to new things, a bit too quickly, Jill.
well, any, any information you give me could be, you know, like, extremely helpful.
I'm not a magic 8 ball.
well, when it told you that I was in trouble, did it sound, like, deeply alarmed, or was it just, like, merely concerned?
you know all I know.
but I would be careful going into the house.
I'm not sure how it will respond to your troubled aura right now.
Amy...please... stop saying that.
I mean, first of all, no one is gonna believe that the house is haunted.
what, the house is haunted?
can I talk to you about the tents over here?
this is outsideour scope of practice, Hank.
we're not a concierge ghost busters service, okay?
we're going into look for mold. I'll take the attic, you take the basement.
I'm not going to the basement.
fine, you take the attic. Try not to get slimed.
Oh, yeah, I should have taken the basement.
Jesus!
moldy, moldy, moldy, mold. Where are you?
God, why would I choose the attic?
Hello? Satan?
I bet the basement is finished... with, like, a pool table.
you sent me up hereto look for mo...
yo, I think I found the mold.
Henry... does the mold make you start hallucinating immediately?
okay, Hank, get up here right now.
because I don't think it's mold, I think it's ghosts.
and... now the ghosts are morphing into bats!
here is your iced tea, Evan. -Thank you so much. I'm really thirsty.
so that's a long island iced tea.
house specialty. I make them every day for family cocktail hour.
Really?
apparently, spirits calm the spirits.
that's...that's an interesting saying.
Amy, do you think that the bats were the dark aura around me?
no, I don't. -Really?
tell me something, Amy.
are you still seeing the dark aura around me?
Hey, is that what I think it is? -Dead bat.
Oh, my god! You could have just said yes, dude.
Zoey, bats can carry rabies, which can cause hallucinations.
what?
just relax. Have you spent time in that attic?
I've been up there once or twice to take measurements for the B&B.
see, Zoey? The bats, the house.
everyone thinks the B&B is a bad idea.
sadly, the house and the bats don't get a vote.
well, I'll go tell them that.
my only recent bites have been mosquito bites, especially since Amy started making us sleep outside.
well, believe it or not, bat bites and mosquito bites look a lot alike.
they're actually really tough to differentiate.
Oh, my god. I know I got bit. I got bit somewhere.
any other theories?
well, a certain fungus can grow on bat guano and cause a respiratory infection called histoplasmosis.
the symptoms don't typically include hallucinations, but coughing is a hallmark sign, along with chills, fever, and headaches.
I've had this cough for a couple weeks now.
Yeah, you said it comes and goes.
comes by day, goes by night.
do you take anything for it?
no, I had a bad reaction to antibiotics when I was younger, so medication kind of freaks me out.
well, while the labtests the bat, I'd like to do a skin test to check for the histoplasmosis, allergies, and anything else that might tell us what's going on here.
okay. -Okay.
remember when I said I was too afraid to go see a doctor?
if I'd known there was a doctor out there like you, I might have foundthe courage.
dude, look at this. Is that a bat bite or a mosquito bite?
you know, I can't really say.
they're exactly the same?
if I got bit by a bat, what's gonna happen to me?
all right, worst case scenario, you die.
best case scenario, you become immortal.
what?
put your shirt on.
tough to find an appropriate card for strategic Indian engagement.
Yeah, you have no idea how long it took me to narrow it down to these two.
there's more card sover there.
so will I see you at hill manor?
I guess so.
by the way, do you know the Hill sisters?
I grew up with them.
what were they like?
well, uh, Zoey was sweet and pretty. Outgoing.
and she knew everyone and always got the guy.
and Amy?
Mm... Amy wore black and founded the high school's wicca club.
pretty quirky chick.
but, you know, in her own special way, she always looked out for her sister and I respected that.
I imagine you would too.
so speaking of old acquaintances... I guess I owe you an explanation.
Oh, look, to be honest, Jill, I really don't want to hear about it.
about him.
if he's here to stay this time, if it works for you and him, I'm happy for you.
and if it doesn't, you know where to find me.
as long as you get that I can't put my life on hold in the meantime.
and I wouldn't ask you to.
I just need to figure out what's right for me, and I can't rush a decision like that.
no, I get it.
let's see what you got.
why this one?
it's just more...you.
I agree.
when you first thought that place might not work, what was it that you were thinking?
truthfully?
I was thinking divine intervention.
spiritual intervention. Whatever. I thought it was an out.
there are no more outs.
we tried to delay this again, and they moved it up.
we're almost there.
we may as well just get it over with.
well, you sound so terribly excited about this marriage.
I know many couples who got married deeply in love.
now, they barely speak.
you have been my best friend for 20 years.
we trust and respect each other. We never fight.
maybe we'll grow into love, instead of falling in and out of it.
but does it feel right to you?
Divya... we have to stop being emotional about logical decisions.
is Zoey's lab report back yet?
no.
but her scratch test was positive for histoplasmosis.
which explainsthe coughing by day, but not the hallucinating by night.
and I just don't think this is psychosis.
which leads us to the possibility of encephalitis.
we got to get this thing solved quickly, so you can get engaged.
well, let's not be too hasty with patient care.
so we...
Divya, we know you and Raj are gonna have some big decisions to make.
just know that Evan and I are here to stay.
and there's always, always a place for you here with Hankmed, no matter what.
well, I appreciate that.
and I'll let you know what my future holds... as soon as my parents decide it for me.
well, maybe negotiations'll still fall apart last minute.
maybe your dad'll raise the dowry to five goats and a donkey and Raj'll call it a deal breaker!
hmm, maybe you're the donkey.
Hankmed, how can... okay, slow down.
it's Amy Hill, and she's freaking out.
we're on our way.
Ah, I tried
I tried to get up there, but the attic door locked behind her.
all right, I'm gonna find a way to get on that roof.
Evan, you try to find a ladder. Divya, keep Amy back.
Zoey, please! Just stay where you are.
don't worry. Hank'll take care of this.
Zoey, Zoey, Zoey, don't move.
look, nothing you're seeing is real.
and you could hurt yourself really badly if you take another step.
do you understand me?
Zoey, are you okay?
Where's Hank? There you are.
here, Divya, I got it.
here, let's get her down over here.
Zoey, what were you doing?
Amy. Your ears are really big.
whoa, is she okay?
as far as the fall, yeah. Yeah, she'll be fine.
you want to do the spinal tap tonight?
and that's not all I want to do.
there may be only one way to get to the bottom of this immediately.
MRI? -Exorcism?
her hallucinations only manifest at night, so we're gonna work a graveyard shift.
a sleepover?
I'm a huge fan of that procedure.
okay, lidocaine. -Prepped.
wow, you're doing a spinal tap in the very place you'll be getting engaged in the next couple days.
that's got to be nine different kinds of bad luck.
shut up, Evan.
what is this for?
spinal needle. It'll help us either diagnose or rule out the encephalitis.
Elephantitis?
no, I don't see any elephants.
all I see is that really big knife.
how's that even gonna fit in me?
she just okay, here we go.
you're doing great.
well, this is a new one for Hankmed.
why don't you just summon the apparitions?
okay, why are you asking me?
cause you're Indian. Maybe some of the rituals translate, right?
wait a second. You think that Hindu is mand wicca have overlapping ideologies?
I'm just thinking outside the box.
you're a bloody neanderthal. Honestly, you're a bloody neanderthal.
what, every time I just...
Amy... everything okay?
no, it's not.
I need to get her something to drink, but we've run out of supplies out here.
I'd have to go...inside.
if Evan needed me to go in that house, I wouldn't care if it was infested with mountain lions,
I'd go in, but... you know, that's just me.
no, it's not just you.
if Zoey asks for me, tell her I'll be right out.
Wa...wait. You're gonna go in the house?
I thou what about the cleansing?
I guess I'll just have to start a new one... after I fix usa round of iced teas.
Zoey. When do you usually have your daily cocktail?
every night before bed.
that's what helps stop the coughing, silly.
okay, I'll be back in a minute.
guys, keep an eye on her for me, please.
what the hell have you been giving your sister?
it's just cough syrup.
she's been up all night, so... I'm giving her a second dose.
does she know you've been putting that in her drink this whole time?
if she did, she wouldn't drink it, because she refuses to take medication.
I just couldn't stand listening to her suffer every night.
this brand of cough syrup has an extremely high percentage of dextromethorphan.
why does that matter?
high volume, high concentration doses of DXM are a bad idea.
and for some people with a genetic inability to metabolize it it's a toxic idea.
you give her this, and within 15 minutes, she stops coughing, but two hours later, when its action peaks, she starts jumping through windows.
I had no clue.
I thought I was helping her.
do you have any idea what it's like to begiven way more responsibility than you ever...asked for?
way more than you ever deserved?
when I was 12, my mom got sick.
my dad, who lost all our money in the stock market, couldn't afford to take care of her.
so he gave up. On her, on us, and he left. And then our mom died.
I know exactly what it's like.
being the older sibling one day and then feeling like a parent the next.
you do anything you can to protect the only thing you have left.
so inanimate objects would grow, shrink, and bend.
distance and depth perception would be skewed as well.
for instance, if you were standing on the roof, looking down, jumping into the moat might look like nothing more than stepping into a puddle.
what's wrong with me, Hank?
it's a disorienting neurological condition called Alice in wonderland syndrome.
but once you stop taking the cough syrup and the DXM in it, you will be back in the real world with the rest of us.
what about her cough?
we'll administer an antifungal called itraconazole.
it will treat the histoplasmosis and clear up the cough as well.
safely.
I am so sorry, Zo.
no, it's...it's okay.
at least we verified that medicine and I still don't get along.
don't blame the medicine.
blame me.
I'm the one who made you spend two weeks in...wonderland.
you broke a cleanse for me.
I know how seriously you take those.
some things I take more seriously.
Oh, g...Hank! It's, it's happening!
so do you think I'm gonna turn into like a an old school, Belalugosi type, or maybe like a hip, sexy, twilight vampire with, like, the
and, like, the cool hair, or what?
I - I can't see anything.
what do you call those, Enrique? Look at the red lines.
I can already feel my skin burning from the sunlight pouring in.
there's nothing on your arm.
why do you keep saying that?
look... okay, what the hell is happening to me?
your mind is playing tricks on you.
I'm hallucinating like... like Zoey?
well, with her, her body was affecting her mind.
with you, it's the opposite.
and you have been actingeven weirder than usual.
why are you so worked up, Evan?
come on, whatever it is, you can tell me.
you know what? It's, uh... it's nothing you have to worry about.
but thank you for...being there.
you know, you always are...
it's got to be exhausting having to... bail me out of trouble over and over again.
Yeah, well, I didn't have much of a choice this time.
you ran into my room and jumped into my bed.
it's beautiful.
so, uh...congratulations?
Yeah, we're so...ambivalent for you.
if you think that this is uncomfortable, wait till you see what happens in 15 minutes.
when I stand up and piss off a tent full of Bandyopadhyays and Katdares.
Oh, my god, are you pregnant?
no, I'm not pregnant.
are you gay?
Evan, really?
Divya... what are you talking about?
I've thought about what you both said to me.
and you're right.
I can't do this.
I won't do this.
and I'm gonna tell that to all of them.
how did Raj take this?
he doesn't know yet. He would just try to talk me out of it.
and even if he didn't, I don't want him to appear complicit in this.
I'm going to do this all on my own.
anyway, I'm so glad that you both came.
cause I may need you to stand by with a getaway vehicle.
I'm way ahead of you.
I record the whole thing on my phone camera and we sell it to bollywood as a reality show, right?
you read my mind.
speaking of, here comes Patricia Arquette and Alice herself.
Hey, how are you feeling, Zoey?
cough gone, hallucinations gone.
know what's weird? I almost miss my little wonderland.
it's like somebody ripped the 3D glasses right off my face.
Nah, I'll take you to an IMAX movie sometime. Way safer.
I got to say, it's really nice to see you guys up and running again... wow.
actually, this is our last event for a while.
Really? Why?
to renovate for our expansion into a bed and breakfast.
how'd she change your mind?
actually, you guys did it.
you staying here the other night made me realize how rewarding it could be...
to have overnight guests.
well, sleepover sand epiphanies. Just two more services we provide at Hankmed.
zip it.
but, for the record, doctor, we'll never know if you cleaned house here the other night, or I did.
well, science and spirituality can share the credit on this one.
uh, looks like we need more chairs. Excuse me.
have you seen that lily pond up close?
you sure it's not just a little puddle?
Oh, well, why don't we go find out?
what do you mean, "it's done and done"?
well, no, this is what I'm saying.
there is no more time. We need that money back now.
I can't believe you're doing this to me. Again.
Hello?
Hey, Evan.
do you know where Hank is?
Yeah, he is right... he was right there.
this place is spooky.
Yeah, there's something important I need to tell him.
Yeah, you and me both.
um...I think he's at the bar.
Oh, no, wait...psychic moment. That's where I'm headed.
this is beautiful.
we used to throw parties right here, but when a drunken groomsman went skinny dipping in the lily pond, Amy didn't take it very well.
she is really protective of this place, huh?
and really protective of you.
I really haven't noticed.
you two definitely don't seem cut from the same cloth.
Oh, well, the same thing could be said about you and Evan.
and it has been said.
Yeah, life sent him one way, me another.
and then it did a funny thing and brought us back together to start this little business of ours.
and somehow... we have found common ground.
you know, um, I grew up hearing people call my sister crazy every single day.
you never assumed I was crazy.
gave me the benefit of the doubt.
most people wouldn't have, Hank.
Yeah, well, more people should be like us.
and less people should be like most people.
so... about that movie you suggested.
Oh, not just a movie. An IMAX experience.
but, Zoey, um...you're a patient.
but I'm cured now.
Yeah, yeah, it looks like you are.
so I'm nota patient anymore.
that's true.
I just got out of a relationship.
Oh, you should have led with that reason.
probably should have.
I - I just need some time, you know, before jumping into something new.
and I have no idea how much time it'll take.
maybe I could tell you.
Really? And how would you do that?
Amy taught me how to read palms.
let's see here.
I see a blonde.
in a lavender summer dress.
I am so sorry, Raj.
thank you all for coming.
and I, uh, I apologize for wasting your time.
but there will be no engagement ceremony.
there will be no wedding. There will be no more of this farce whatsoever.
I could stand up here and tell you that I love Raj with all my heart, but the truth is...
I don't.
nor does he love me.
we are just two friends, never given a chance to love anybody but each other.
and we deserve that chance.
and now... finally... we're going to have it.
what's up, brah?
did Jill find you yet?
no, why? What'd she say?
she had something important to tell you.
so do I.
what's up?
we're broke.
what do you mean broke?
I mean depleted, destitute, insolvent.
I was asking for an explanation, not a thesaurus.
what the hell are you talking about, Evan?
well, I, uh, I invested our working capital in some alternative, high yield instruments English, Evan.
we got scammed.
you got scammed. By who?
and it's all gone, you know.
almost every last penny of it, at least. It's...it's gone.
why are you not furious?
Oh, I'm furious.
I I'm furious. I'm just not surprised.
in fact, the only shock here is that it took this long for you to let me down.
look, I'm gonna find a way to get that money.
don't you get it?
it's not about the money. It's about the secrets, the lies, the greed.
we can rebuild. I know we can.
Yeah, Hankmed, maybe.
my trust in you... doubtful.
come on, that... Hank.
I'm...I'm guessing you're here for Jill.
would you like me to let her know you dropped by next time I see her?
uh, actually, I was told she had a message for me.
but...I guess I got the message pretty clearly now.
let me know if it needs any further clarification.
maybe I can help you out with that.
who was at the door?
Oh, it was just some guy.
he had the wrong house.
no, he didn't, Charlie.
you did. Get your stuff and get out.
now.
Charlie. Leave the wine.
I can't believe you didn't tell me that dad took all our money.
a hundred years ago, all was right with our world.
prosperity and peace filled our days.
the Four Nations:
water, Earth, Fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony.
great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element.
the Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements.
he was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World.
with the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world.
and then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time.
I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange?
Yeah. I guess so.
just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet.
my brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War.
my mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young.
in this time of war, food is scarce.
my brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world.
tiger seal. - Are you sure?
I did everything Dad said to do.
I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented.
that shows which direction they're going.
I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going.
there's something under there.
it's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks!
Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick.
just back away really slow.
Katara! Do not hit that sphere!
uncle, look!
is he breathing?
did you see that light shoot into the sky?
what's your name?
how did you get here? How did you get in the ice?
he's exhausted.
we need to get him back to the village.
what is this thing?
it's trying to eat me!
look. See?
how'd you get all the way out here?
I ran away from home.
we got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean.
I see.
it wasn't very smart. I was just upset.
thanks for saving me. - Lucky.
I probably should get home. They'll all be worried.
you're not still upset? - Not as much as I was.
the Fire Nation is here.
what? - And they brought their machines.
don't come out till I tell you it's safe.
is something wrong? - No. Please wait here.
hurry, now! - Secure the area!
it can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines.
Sokka, don't.
I am Prince Zuko...
...son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne!
bring me all your elderly!
Papa! - Move!
yeah?
grandma!
please don't... don't harm him!
come on!
Katara, don't.
form a line! - Come on!
here.
Hey.
Grammy!
you're scaring these people.
who are you? What's your name?!
I don't need to tell you anything. - Firebenders!
I'm taking you to my ship.
if you don't come, I'll burn down this village.
I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone.
they were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had.
they dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies.
she wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought.
we found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight.
what would you do if they tried to take me away?
I'd kill them all.
Why? - Because you're my sister.
because Dad told me to protect you with my life.
because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility.
what do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him?
they're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them.
I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't.
his bison creature thing floats.
what do you want with me?
my nephew wants me to perform a little test on you.
what kind of test? - I assure you, it won't hurt.
I've performed it hundreds of times. It only takes a few moments.
and then you're free to go.
would you mind if I put a few things in front of you at the table?
it will only take a moment.
that's all you want?
my name is Iroh, and you have my word.
grandma, I know you're gonna try to stop us, - but this is just something I need... - Sit down.
I knew from the first time we discovered you were a Bender, that one day, I would realize your destiny.
there hasn't been a Waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe since my friend Hama was taken away.
today, I found out that destiny.
did you see that boy's tattoos?
tattoos like that haven't been seen in over a century.
I believe they are Airbending tattoos.
how can that be?
I believe that little boy might be the Avatar.
once, a long time ago, the Spirit World kept balance over us.
what is the Spirit World, Grandma?
it's not a place made up of things you can touch.
but it exists, nonetheless.
it is filled with the most amazing forms of dazzling creatures...
...that exist in the most exotic valleys, mountains and forests.
each of these creatures is a Spirit.
they've watched over us since the beginning.
they have guided us. And only the Avatar can go speak to them.
aren't there Spirits here?
Yes, there are some Spirits that live hidden among us, sure they're watching us with great sadness...
the Fire Nation doesn't wish to live by the Spirits.
that's why they're so frightened by the existence of the Avatar.
what can he do? - With his mastery of the four elements, he will begin to change hearts.
and it is in the heart that all wars are won.
now, go help this boy.
he will need you two.
and we all need him.
you are my prisoner...
...Airbender.
I'm taking you back to the Fire Nation.
you said... - I apologize.
I should have explained further.
if you failed the test, as all others did, you were free to leave.
but, as it turns out, you are the only one in the entire world who could pass this test.
it is truly an honor to be in your presence.
don't even try to escape. This is a warship!
stop! There's no way you can...
don't move! You have nowhere to run!
Halt!
don't let him escape!
get him!
thanks for bringing Appa to me.
the Fire Nation is up to something. I have to go back now.
we'll come with you. - I can take you back to the village.
we're going with you.
you found the Avatar.
for a moment, I had my honor back.
your destinies are tied, Zuko. That, you can be sure of.
Aang flew us to his home. He told us how he left there in a storm on Appa, and got forced into the ocean where they almost drowned.
Aang Airbended a sphere around them, and ice formed.
and he couldn't remember anything after that.
Hey, Chinto! Monae! I'm back!
Hey, guys! I want you to meet someone!
this is where you live?
they must be playing some trick or something.
monk Gyatso is gonna try and jump out and scare me at any moment.
he's the teacher responsible for me.
he's kind of like my father.
is it OK if you tell me your name? - The monks named me Aang.
OK, guys! Enough!
Spider-rat! They're poisonous! Get behind me.
he's a flying lemur-bat. We keep them as pets.
weren't they extinct a long time ago?
extinct? No, there must be thousands of them on this mountain.
your friends were monks?
I know where they are right now. They're at the prayer field!
Aang, wait! I have to talk to you!
Aang...
...I think you were in that ice for almost a hundred years.
the Firebenders started a war. - I left a few days ago.
Aang, the Fire Nation knew the Avatar would be born into the Air Nomads...
...so they exterminated all the Air Nomads.
you're lying!
you're lying!
this is Monk Gyatso's.
I made it for him.
No!
Katara! Stay away from him!
Katara!
stay away from him!
your friends were monks?
the Avatar?
where have you been?
Aang!
you can't bring Monk Gyatso back, but Sokka and I can be with you as long as you need!
don't give up! We can do this together!
Aang!
the banished prince.
let's offer him lunch.
I wanted to thank the great General Iroh and young Prince Zuko for dining with us.
as you know, the Fire Lord has banished his son, the Prince, and renounced his love of him, and will not let him return to the throne unless he finds the Avatar.
the Fire Lord believes his son is too soft, and by doing this, he will become strong and become a worthy heir to the throne.
I commend the Fire Lord's discipline.
for example, it seems I need to remind Prince Zuko that, during his banishment, he is an enemy of the Fire Nation and is not allowed to wear the Fire Nation uniform.
but we will let him wear it today, like a child wearing a costume.
one day, my father will take me back and you will bow before me.
you OK?
I'll be fine.
you know, my grandma thinks because you're an Airbender, that you could be the Avatar.
how much does the Fire Nation control?
a lot of villages in the Earth Kingdom, like around here.
they haven't been able to conquer big cities, like Ba Sing Se, but they're making plans, I'm sure.
so...
...are you the Avatar, Aang?
what is this?
stay hidden.
that child is being arrested. - For what?
he was bending tiny stones at us from behind a tree. It really hurt.
he can bend earth?
Earthbending is forbidden in this village.
leave him alone. You're not taking him anywhere.
no one is taking anybody away!
she's a bender!
Katara!
move.
you, too.
dad!
this is my father. - Hello.
that's the Fire Nation's plan, suppress all other bending.
how did this happen to your village?
fire Nation sent soldiers. We fought them and defeated them.
then they sent their machines, huge machines made of metal.
there was nothing we could do.
those who could not bend were allowed to live in peace, if we were imprisoned.
Earthbenders!
why are you acting this way? You are powerful and amazing people!
you don't need to live like this! There is earth right beneath your feet.
the ground is an extension of who you are!
if the Avatar had returned...
...would that mean anything to you?
the Avatar is dead. If he was here, he would protect us.
my name is Aang...
...and I am the Avatar.
I ran away, but I'm back now.
it's time for you to stop doing this!
the Avatar would have to be an Airbender. Are you an Airbender, boy?
leave him alone!
how is he doing that?
I don't want to hurt anyone.
all Airbenders should be dead. Kill him! Firebenders, positions!
OK! Everybody can help us now!
don't be afraid!
just leave them!
fall back!
go! He's an Airbender!
they took away any tools related to bending.
the Fire Nation took this scroll from a member of your Water Tribe.
a Waterbending scroll.
this is rare. My mom told me about these.
this was you when you were born an Earthbender, two lifetimes ago.
you came to our village.
avatar Kyoshi loved games.
I do, too. I mean, I still do.
a lot of the villages in this part of the Earth Kingdom are occupied by the Fire Nation, like this village was.
they prey on the weakest towns and villages.
we should go visit some of these towns, Aang.
I need to tell you something. - What is it, Aang?
I ran away before they trained me to be the Avatar.
I don't know how to bend the other elements.
why did you run away?
the day they told me I was the Avatar, they said I could never have a normal life, that I could never have a family.
they said it cannot work with the responsibilities of the Avatar.
why can't the Avatar have a family? - I asked that!
they said that's the sacrifice the Avatar always has to make.
OK. So, what if we found you teachers. Teachers to teach you bending?
which element would you have to learn first?
water. Water comes after Air in the cycle.
air, Water, Earth, Fire.
but there are really powerful benders in the Northern Water Tribe.
my dad told me about it before he left.
it's led by a princess because her father died.
there are teachers there, but all the way on the other side of the world.
we can get there on Appa. - That's what I was thinking.
and maybe we can stop in the villages on the way, start a change in The War in these small villages.
should we try it? - Yes, we should.
the scroll we had was proving to be helpful.
Aang was practicing, but for some reason, he was having trouble with Waterbending.
we moved from town to town in the Earth Kingdom.
we tried to stay out of sight, but Sokka became concerned we were being followed.
sire, I have good news.
as you know, I conducted a raid on the Great Library, - which most said didn't exist. - Get on with it.
I found scrolls in the library. We are deciphering them.
but I believe they may contain information as to where the Ocean and Moon Spirits live in this world.
with this information, we could bring down the Northern Water Tribe city, we could show the world the true strength of fire.
I am pleased.
well, Commander Zhao, are the rumors true or not?
our spies have discovered someone claiming to be the Avatar.
they describe him as just a boy.
we should set a trap for this person.
we have many Earth Kingdom people under our control.
I can leave soldiers hidden in certain locations.
and my son? - He had his chance. He missed it.
let's hope, for your sake, my son doesn't find this person first and he turns out to be the Avatar.
he would return as a hero and, for all purposes, be your superior.
well, I suppose it's a race, then.
we're close, Uncle.
they've been moving farther and farther north.
we're catching them.
there are a lot of pretty girls in this town, Zuko.
you could fall in love here.
we could settle down here, and you could have a blessed life.
we don't have to continue this, Zuko.
I'll show you why we must, Uncle.
Hey. Hey. Little one, come here.
you look like a very smart boy.
tell me what you know about the Prince, the Fire Lord's son.
he did something wrong. - He spoke out of turn to a general, in defense of some of his friends who were going to be sacrificed in a battle.
then Prince Zuko was sentenced to an Agni Kai duel, but when he showed up, - it was his father he was to fight. - That's right.
he would not fight his father.
then his father mocked him and said, "I should bring your sister up here to beat you."
then the father burnt his son...
... to teach him a lesson.
we'll catch him soon, Uncle.
then we can think about the pretty girls.
Aang...
try to keep your wrist bent, like it's showing.
what's wrong? You've really been distracted today.
I saw Sokka's maps. We're near the Northern Air Temple.
do you think it would be OK if I just visited there and came back?
I'd be back in less than a day. - Why?
he had a vision at the Southern Air Temple prayer field.
he talked to a Dragon Spirit who he thinks can help us.
he thinks if he goes to another spiritual place, he can get back to the Spirit World.
I don't think that's a good idea. We started a rebellion.
try to talk him out of it.
I can't do this.
I need help.
I guess your talk didn't work. - He'll be back in a day.
the Fire Nation is following us. If we make a wrong move, they'll catch him.
who are you?
why, it cannot be!
I've heard stories. Are you?
my name is Aang.
I cannot believe I've lived to see your return.
I'm an Earth villager, but I visit these temple remains often.
the Fire Nation destroyed this temple. They have ruined everything.
no, no, no, not everything.
you know, there's a hidden chamber of statues
I think you, of all people, should see.
these are all the Avatars.
these are the reincarnations of you over the years.
the Avatar Roku was your last life.
now, how did the Airbenders know you were the Avatar, little one?
they gave me a test.
they put 1, 000 toys in front of me and asked me to choose four.
they said I chose the same four objects that belonged to the previous Avatars.
that's when they told me I could have no family.
told me I had a responsibility to the Four Nations.
there's a ceremony when everyone bows to me.
that's when I accept my role as the Avatar.
but when everyone bowed...
...I didn't bow back.
you seem like a nice young man.
you really do. You will forgive me, won't you?
for what? - For luring you down here.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
so you will understand my actions today.
I have lived in poverty because of your absence, Avatar.
I have seen a vision of the moon turning red.
the Fire Nation has stolen knowledge of us from the Great Library.
they are planning to misuse this knowledge.
I will stop them.
you must go to the Northern Water Tribe.
if they take that city, more will suffer and die, as your Airbenders have.
you must go now!
will I stop them?
wake up, young man!
my name is Commander Zhao. I set this trap for you.
don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.
besides, you'd just be reborn again, and then the search would continue.
so where have you been all this time?
and how is it that you're still a boy?
I understand that when you freed that handful of towns, you were very impressive, but...
...you only used Airbending against my soldiers.
now, why is that?
the Fire Lord and I have a plan to ensure our reign and the downfall of our enemies.
I am sending a personal message to the Fire Lord, informing him that the once feared Avatar is our prisoner and no threat to our might.
who are you?
wait! Don't!
stop!
fools.
close the inner gates! The Avatar has escaped!
lock down the gate!
lock down all the gates!
to the main post!
this was their practice area.
go again!
do not kill the Avatar!
he will just be reborn again!
why are you doing this? Who are you?
open the gates.
let them out!
is it some kind of Spirit, Commander? - Not at all.
do it.
what is this?
and how did he escape?
I fear that your son is not only incompetent, but also a traitor.
of course, I cannot prove this, sire.
you think...
...my son is this person the soldiers are calling the Blue Spirit.
Yes.
zhao's men were searching the coast, looking for you.
they also searched the ship.
I told them you went on vacation with a girl.
where were you the past four days?
nowhere.
we have to keep moving.
the Avatar is traveling again.
take rest first.
it looks like you went through a great deal.
when you wake, we'll have tea together before we start the engines.
do not harm my son.
leave him to his isolation.
you have my word, sire. I will not harm him.
Zuko!
and what of the Avatar?
we assume he has rejoined with his supporters.
it has been confirmed that he's traveling north.
it is my strong belief that he is traveling to the Northern Water Tribe.
I believe the child Avatar has only knowledge of his birth element, Air.
I believe he is trying to learn in the discipline of water.
he's gone to seek out someone in the Northern Water Tribe, where they have lived beyond our reach and openly practice Waterbending.
we arrived at the Northern Water Tribe.
we presented ourselves to the royal court.
my brother and the princess became friends right away.
Aang showed them he was the last Airbender, and was accepted to train with the master.
the city knew our arrival would bring great danger.
and they prepared for war they knew would come in the ensuing weeks.
the city was designed to withstand any assault.
if we keep them to the courtyard and the marketplace till night falls, where we have the advantage, we will succeed.
if we let too many of them into the city, their sheer numbers could overwhelm us.
as many fires in this city should be put out as possible when the alarm sounds.
we want to minimize their bender sources.
I must assign a guard to be with you at all times, Princess.
your presence is our inspiration.
I'll do it. That's me. I'll be her guard.
nothing will happen to her.
I had a feeling you might volunteer.
I've heard no word of my son for quite some time.
do you know where he is? - I've not heard of anything, sire.
I'm sure word of him will come to us soon.
the Northern Water Tribe benders are given their strength by the Moon and Ocean Spirits. They will be difficult to defeat.
now, if for some reason the Spirits were not involved, that would be different.
what have you learned from the stolen scrolls?
we have deciphered the location of the Moon and Ocean Spirits.
it is our destiny to have found this information, Zhao.
eliminate the Spirits, take the city and we will have thwarted the Avatar in the process.
water is what?
the flowing element. The element of change.
to master water, you must release your emotions, wherever they may lead you.
water teaches us acceptance.
let your emotions flow like water.
Aang, would you like to spar? You haven't sparred in a few days.
now, use offense, Aang!
general Iroh, I'm glad you could accept my invitation to join us - on this historic event. - Your invitation was most gracious.
you are a gifted strategist. No one can argue that.
your failure in the Hundred Day Siege of Ba Sing Se won't be held against you.
your son died in that siege, didn't he?
Yes, he did.
again, I offer my condolences on your nephew burning to death in that terrible accident.
thank you.
I've loved spending these weeks with you, Sokka.
me, too.
should we see what the ocean is doing today?
when there is some safety for all of us,
I will come visit our sister city in the Southern Water Tribe and spend some time in your home.
that would be great.
but I warn you...
...my grandmother will ask you a lot of questions.
what might she ask me?
she'll say, "Why is your hair white, young lady? You look very odd."
I would say to your grandmother, my hair is white because when I was born
I was not awake.
my mother and father could not get me to make a sound or move.
so they prayed for days to the Moon Spirit and dipped me into the sacred waters.
my parents said that my hair turned white then and life poured into me.
Wow.
you didn't tell me that.
you didn't ask me.
only your grandmother did.
I'm sure Zhao was the one who ordered the attack on you.
any problems?
we have arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's stronghold.
they believe the boy is there.
why do you seem upset, Uncle?
zhao has no sacredness.
are you sure you want to be here?
I will not be allowed to live in peace until I bring the Avatar to my father!
is that not clear to you?
what is this?
Yue...
...the Fire Nation is here.
now be sure to keep your uniform closed up to your neck.
and remember, your Chi can warm you.
I know, Uncle.
be safe.
Aang needs to ask you something.
I have to talk to the Dragon Spirit.
he can help me defeat the Fire Nation.
is there a spiritual place where I can meditate?
there is a very spiritual place. The city was built around this place.
but we must hurry.
Momo, be nice.
to get your Airbending tattoos, you have to meditate for long periods of time without losing focus.
some of the great monks can meditate for four days.
I have to get back. - I'll take you.
I'll stay with him.
Aang?
Aang, can you hear me?
I knew you were real.
I always knew you'd return.
me, too.
the Fire Lord's son.
you took him from our village.
who are you?
my name is Katara, and I'm the only Waterbender left in the Southern Water Tribe.
go for the children. - Yes.
I'm not allowed to go home without him.
the Waterbenders get power from the moon.
they will get stronger as the day comes to an end.
general Iroh, I've been keeping a secret.
and what is that?
in my raid of the Great Library earlier this year,
I found a scroll that tells the location of the Ocean and Moon Spirits.
to meet a Spirit would be a great honor.
well, I hope I can give you that honor.
what happened?
what happened?
prince Zuko's here in the city. He took Aang again.
we'll just wait till everyone's fighting everyone.
then in the night, we'll slip out.
Aang, can you hear me?
I knew you were real.
I always knew you'd return.
Hello! Hello!
please, tell me how to beat the Fire Nation!
you are not dealing with the loss of your people, and your responsibility for their deaths.
you are stopping yourself from grieving.
you are angry.
you must let this go.
as the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
use the ocean.
show them the power of Water.
go! Do this now.
my sister Azula was always the special one.
she was a Firebending prodigy.
my father loves her.
he can't even look at me sometimes.
he says I'm like my mother.
I advise that you pull back your men soon.
they will be trapped in the city when the moon's power comes out.
do not worry about the moon's power, General Iroh.
why should you not be worried about the moon's power?
because your brother, Fire Lord Ozai, and I have decided it is in our best interests to kill the Moon Spirit.
what?
calm down. We'll find him.
are you OK? Did the Spirits tell you anything?
Yes. The Dragon Spirit talked to me. I know what to do.
Aang, we have to go.
you won't be killed by Waterbenders if you stay hidden here.
we could be friends, you know.
they're getting stronger.
this is a scroll from the Great Library. This is our map.
our world is going to change soon, gentlemen.
right there and right there.
see where they're going! I'll go join the fight!
they are called many names: Yin and Yang, push and pull.
may I introduce you to the mysterious Ocean and Moon Spirits?
why do Spirits take the form of such benign things?
it leaves them so vulnerable.
to teach man kindness and humility.
commander Zhao, there are certain things humankind should not tamper with.
the Spirits and the Spirit World is one of them.
what are you doing here?
stop, Zhao.
the world will go out of balance. Everyone will be hurt.
the Fire Nation is too powerful to worry about children's superstitions, General Iroh.
commander Zhao, don't.
we are now the gods!
No!
man all battle stations!
you are too soft, General Iroh.
he's making fire out of nothing!
they're breaching the wall!
to the front!
as the Avatar, you are not meant to hurt others.
you must show them the power of Water.
all is lost.
you have been anointed by the Moon Spirit.
he gave me life when I was a child. - Then there is still a chance.
you can give your life back for the Spirit's.
don't listen to him, he's Fire Nation. - Nothing is ever truly lost.
is it mine to give back, if I choose? - There are reasons each of us are born.
we have to find those reasons.
this was the reason I was born. - Yue, please.
there is no love without sacrifice.
yue, what are you doing? You don't know what will happen.
I believe my life force will leave my body and return to the Moon Spirit.
and then what?
my soul will no longer exist in this form.
please don't do this. There must be another way.
I can't let you do this. I'm supposed to protect you.
my people are dying, Sokka.
those who are in charge of others have a responsibility.
it is time we show the Fire Nation we believe in our beliefs - as much as they believe in theirs. - But Yue...
I'm scared. Don't make me any more scared.
I will miss you more than you know.
I killed you.
come away from him, nephew.
there are too many soldiers now.
they will never let you take the Avatar.
we must leave immediately.
he wants to fight you so he can capture you, Zuko.
walk away!
come!
you stand alone.
and that has always been your great mistake.
water teaches us acceptance.
let your emotions flow like water.
Aang?
they want you to be their Avatar, Aang.
we all do.
our forces in the Northern Water Tribe have failed to take the city.
general Zhao was killed in battle and my brother has become a traitor.
my son's proven himself a failure.
now, Sozin's Comet is returning in three years.
it will give all Firebenders the ability of the highest Firebenders, the ability to use their own Chi to create Fire.
that is the day we will win this war and prove the Fire Nation's dominance.
now you must stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire.
you must give us the time to get to that day.
even though they called it "the Wilde estate,
it was pretty peaceful on our first full day there.
keep them quiet. shh.
not so much rattling.
and Steve wanted us to love it.
wake up, Hey, bring the coffee.
but my mom and I were already up.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
we had been in town, where she was enrolling me In my new school.
cool. - When they open the door,
I want them to see the ham.
Steve. - Oh, Emmy. You're up.
Hi. Hey, guys, Emmy's up.
no need to be quiet anymore.
what is all of this?
well, I just wanted to welcome you - To your beautiful, new, serene- - Oh, god!
ham!
Lunt! - My bad!
Steve, this is all very sweet.
but you know that there are only two of us, right,
and one of us is 12?
which is why we have the 12-and-under waffle trolley,
for which you just barely qualify.
there's a waffle trolley?
there's a waffle trolley.
look, the child is starving.
Yes, she is.
we walked five miles because I couldn't find my car.
that's because it's gone, and in its place...
a new car.
my car is gone?
don't worry. I recycled.
and the metal cube it was crushed into Is now a coffee table.
where is that new car?
man, is that quiet.
Migo, where's the car?
this is it, boss. It's a volt.
I thought she'd like it because it's electric!
and plus, it's very sporty, no?
I said to get a real car,
not some giant electric toy car.
I'm sorry, we'll get you a real one.
puddle, you can have this thing.
Yay!
no, Steve, she can't have a car. She's 12.
boo. - Don't complain.
it got you into the waffle trolley.
and, Steve, you can't go around Giving me huge gifts like-- So, really, you just plug it in?
is that how that works? - You can plug it Into a household
this is a three-hour charge. - It's the wave of the future.
no, no, no, Steve, wait, listen.
I appreciate everything you're doing here.
it is--it's thoughtful. It's generous.
well, it was until Mr. Fat fingers Couldn't hold on to a ham long enough To get it up into a tree.
Steve, it's an eight-pound ham!
you'll throw out your back!
ham!
Oh, great, it's my one nice shirt.
Yeah, yeah.
it's your one nice-- Really nice shirt.
Oh, it's not my only shirt.
the rest of my clothes are in the backseat of my
Oh. You need new clothes?
well, now that we've had a delicious breakfast,
and it's time to get dressed for the day,
I thought that we should review some new options.
now, remember, these are sized For the models.
so we'll obviously alter them For your particular needs.
I know it's kind of lame,
but we couldn't get any actual models To get up this early.
I'm going to assume this was very well-intentioned,
but this is exactly The kind of thing
I don't want my daughter exposed to
fashion and pop culture and women being objectified.
Oh, well, after dolores,
the next few aren't technically women.
don't worry. The outfits will work on you.
of course, you'd look good in anything.
heck, you'd look good in nothing.
Steve, the fact that you think I'd want a fashion show
points out how very little you know about-- Now that is cute.
Yeah, picture it without the kitchen gloves.
no, that's what makes it fun.
right?
no, what am I doing?
what is this doing to puddle?
you know what? She's a great kid,
and she's not used to all of this opulence.
she is very happy with very little.
I had to do something, or I'd seen my last waffle.
he doesn't know any better, mom.
I don't.
he wants to change... - I do.
but just doesn't know how. - I don't.
I'm not worried About Steve, okay?
I'm worried about you.
me? - Her?
me? I'm fine.
I don't care about this stuff.
steve could give those clothes To the homeless or something, right?
sure. Look, Emmy, I'm not saying that my life works.
it doesn't, but I want it to.
I think that there's a real opportunity here for both of us.
and I want to use it.
I don't want to end up Some shallow cad who just uses lame lines On women like
you didn't think it was sexy When I said that you'd look good in nothing?
Oh, that was supposed to be sexy.
okay, you're right.
I mean, I moved in here because you asked me
to help you become a better person,
to lead a more responsible life.
and if you're serious...
I am.
then I guess now is as good time as any to start.
you know what we could do?
we could take all of that breakfast food,
we could go down to the shelter, and we could feed everybody.
Yeah. I don't care about fancy waffles.
or ten different kinds of syrups.
there were syrups?
you didn't try the s-- migo!
Yeah, boss.
can you get that waffle trolley Back in here, please?
on it.
drama NameSeason X Episode X
steve set to work To show my mother he could be the man She wanted him to be.
you're disappointed.
Oh, please.
I can wear escada anytime.
I'm more worried about you.
every time you try To have any kind of fun,
that woman is just going to tinkle all over
Hey, Hey, Hey, - Well, she's plain as Maine,
and you were only trying to help.
Hey, he's overreacting, right?
I mean, change can be good.
maybe I do need to change.
Oh, you definitely need to change.
your life has very little purpose.
I just don't think you're going to succeed.
Hey, my life has a purpose.
it's winning over Emmy.
I mean, let's face it,
I've spent a lot of time as a playboy partyer.
I don't remember one truly happy moment.
that doesn't mean he didn't have them.
he's got a sword!
you know, I'm actually looking forward To living with less.
so I should cancel The big, giant party this weekend?
well, no, obviously we can't do that,
not with fa'ad living next door.
steve and fa'ad had always competed Over who threw the best parties.
it started when fa'ad wanted to throw a party But had nothing to celebrate.
so Steve threw an even more pointless one
about the onset of daylight standard time.
fa'ad countered with a daylight savings party.
and finally,
steve threw a party That celebrated having nothing to celebrate.
no, the "unnecessoiree" has become the most meaningful Meaningless party of the year.
of course. It's the deepest shallow thing you do.
but it's just going to prove to Emmy that you can't change.
well, what am I supposed to do? I can't cancel it, especially since fa'ad Has started throwing his party on the same night.
Yeah, fa'ad figured, "what could be more unnecessary - Than another 'unnecessoiree' on the same night?" - ah!
so if fa'ad finds out that I'm canceling my party, - He will swoop in on my guest list like-- - like one of my falcons? Ka-ah!
does anybody have a dead mouse on them, by any chance?
no matter.
so sorry to overhear That your party won't be happening, Steve.
but, uh, I have to admit,
I assumed as much
what, with that family of environmentalists
living in your tree house like so many falcons. Ka-ah!
Ugh. Ever since they found that ham,
they've been un-trainable.
in an event,
I want you to know That you're welcome to be a guest at my, I suppose,
now slightly more necessary "unnecessoiree.
I have a very large property.
Emmy never needs to know.
and I'm sure the woman goes to sleep at the crack of 10: 00,
which means that she'll be long gone By the time my first guest arrives.
no, no. My party will be a huge, happy success.
yes...
unless one of us was unlucky enough to say something stupid.
Yes, but something stupid Is the last thing either of us would say.
and you'll never tell Emmy.
Yes. Of course...
the last thing you said was, "you'll never tell Emmy.
so here's hoping that's not the stupid last thing.
don't, okay?
don't tell Emmy about my party.
may god tear my eyes out if I do.
wait, don't you mean Allah?
whatever. A-ha!
in the jungle,
we would've called this "ata oka," or bad omen,
but Steve just went back to thinking About where to put the party tent.
steve set to work On what he was hoping would be a secret party.
what are these tents for?
well, I guess I can tell you.
kind of throwing a big party.
but, Steve, you said you'd be less extravagant.
go buy these giant tents?
Oh, no. I didn't buy them.
they come free with Whitney Houston.
by the way, I'm gonna need help lying to your mom.
you know how I'm not really very good at lying to your mom.
it's gonna get pretty intense.
what's gonna be intense?
Whitney Houston and the V. I.P. Room.
man, do you get up early.
you're having a party, And, what, you were going to try to keep it from me?
no. I just know how much you don't like "fun.
I like fun.
no, I'm just talking about how you're "not fun.
I am fun.
stop doing the quotes. God, I'm fun.
I hate it when people say I'm not fun, because I am fun.
remember those parties I used to throw In the tree house in high school?
that was fun.
those were parties?
we just have a different definition. - You know what? Listen
I was a kid.
you can't expect a kid to have fun.
this is the woman who's raising me.
anyway, I was a little 15-year-old nerd.
I am not the same person today.
and I'm not the same Super-cool, rocking-it-out, Party--oh,
I guess I still kind of am.
look, you're gonna hate this party, okay?
there's just way too much excess and waste.
I'll just cancel it.
don't cancel it.
just do it without all the excess and waste.
well, those two things-- they're kind of Like the backbone of the "unnecessoiree.
you can help him, right, mom?
that was my first mistake.
if he wants me to, sure.
of course he does, right, Steve?
this was my second mistake.
sure. Yeah.
I just want the people wasted, not the food.
you can have a very fun party without everyone getting wasted.
that's like your joke about your one nice shirt...
that turned out not to be a joke.
here's what we do-- we take what you already have.
we just scale it down.
great. Yes. I love that. We scale it down.
so this is what we have so far.
obviously we can just add anything to it as we go.
just keep looking.
Steve, add anything to it?
I mean, this is a bowl of cristal.
isn't that kind of pricey?
it is,
which is why I didn't want to fill the actual pool with it
three days before the party-- that would be wasteful.
see, your mom's having a positive effect on me already.
this is supposed to be the actual pool?
no, no, I scaled it down, like you asked me to.
can I play with one With one of your dolls?
Oh, no, no, no, Those aren't gonna be dolls.
believe me, after the party,
you're not gonna want to go anywhere near her.
here's what I'm thinking, - a lot of this already feels Too big. - Small.
it's big. - It's small.
and it's big. - It's very small.
it's big. - Small.
small? - Big.
impersonal.
it is big.
I'll tell you what we do.
we do the shopping ourselves.
okay, great.
we find a discount store. - If they even have them.
we buy in bulk. We get everybody's favorite stuff.
let's do this. - Let's do it.
okay. - Okay.
my god, discount stores?
why don't we just slather everything and everyone In mayonnaise?
do you think she'd go for that?
Yeah, that sounds great.
now we're having a party!
I'd never seen anything Like the place we went to.
I think we were all a little overwhelmed.
Oh, my god.
this place is as big as a village. - House.
this is so cool.
can I get one of these?
Yeah, I don't think you can get one of anything in this place.
check it out. They got a five-gallon vat of mustard here That costs as much as those little packets Migo used to get me from Yankee stadium.
like horses.
okay, Steve, look, focus,
we're here for the party.
now, I say we do swizzlers,
because they're cheap, and everybody loves them.
so we've taken care of that.
wait, no, no, that's it?
no, I think my friends are going to expect A little bit more than that.
no, if people aren't going to be loosened up,
how can we have the couple that has the one big fight
and then makes a big scene at the end of the party? I mean, that's-- don't you think that-- We both think that's fun, right?
Yeah. But if I would've known that,
I would've made some Of my famous Amazonian jungle hooch.
don't have the right worms.
you know what? They have a whole wall of champagne.
and I'm sure it's fairly priced.
well, that's a great call.
Yes, let's get a wall full of champagne.
I was thinking, like, one or two bottles.
I was afraid that that's what you're thinking.
okay, I'm a little worried that we're kind of going-- What's the word?
- "underboard" with this thing.
I mean, we want people to have fun at the party, right?
okay, I get it.
you don't think I'm fun.
and you know what? I might not be fun.
so why don't you do the party the way you want it,
and I will get off your back?
no, no, no, I want you on my back.
heck, I want you on your back.
no, what I'm saying is the swizzlers are great.
let's get some mustard.
how about a pallet of chips?
don't give me that look, migo.
he asked me to do this.
I know, but a man can only change so much.
and, yes, I overcharged him for a thing or two.
but I care about him,
and I don't want to see anybody get hurt, that's all.
are you kidding me?
these chips are a dollar a bag!
God, you're going to ruin everything!
well, I'm a little worried for your party, my friend.
if this is the best that you can do,
I worry that the reputations
Oh, I don't have the energy for this charade.
it's brilliant.
it'll make my party seem As worthless as one of your American college degrees.
I'm actually quite optimistic about my party.
I think that-- oh, I don't have the energy For this charade.
my party's gonna be worse Than your dumpster full of stillborn foals.
stillborn foa-- Oh, I don't have the energy for this charade.
Hey, does it seem like we're unusually tired today?
it has come up a lot.
nevertheless, You've painted a forest red, and you're bringing in A huge wild animal death chamber of some sort.
that's not a forest.
it's just a plastic drum Filled with something so inexpensive,
it can't even call itself licorice.
there's a step below licorice? - Apparently.
well, why not build it into a forest?
it's not a forest.
it's--it's not a scale model.
this is the sum total of the extravagance of my party.
but what of the giant cocaine-covered orgy dome?
that is something Called the "hostess snowball.
so the hostess goes in there and-- - It's not a place.
none of this is a place.
it's just--it's just food.
Steve, Steve! Steve! you're ruining it! - It's food!
you're ruining the world! - No, it's just food!
no, not the orgy dome! - No, it's pennies!
it doesn't matter!
well, if it is pennies,
then what about the giant dirigible head of
Oh, my, is that me?
that's a balloon from a child's movie, you fool.
you can get a trillion of them for a dime at this garbage store That Emmy took me to.
well, I wanted your party to fail,
but not so badly that nobody would come To one of our parties ever again.
Steve, you have to cancel this party.
what? No, you can't.
Steve, my mom finally thinks you can change.
Oh, I can change.
I can change everything on this table Into so much...
I can change everything on this table Into so much...
why are we so tired? - I don't know.
perhaps it was your trip to the store.
Yes, and all your recent hawk attacks.
Steve, you can't give up on it now.
you were the guy that was able to get People to celebrate having nothing to celebrate.
why don't you try to convince people that it's fun...
to not have fun.
Yes.
what the child seems to be saying
is that even though the food at the party might be awful...
the irony will be so delicious That the party will be a huge success.
now I'm getting worried that I may be going overboard
with my giant walk-in snowball And team of snowball hostesses.
you already stole that idea?
I texted my guy as soon as I saw it.
but now I'm thinking Perhaps I'll just serve a bowl of raisinets.
ha ha! - No.
don't, okay?
I'm really starting to like my party theme.
please don't steal it.
I won't.
and so everything was set.
steve was going to have the most necessary Unnecessary party
that anyone's ever had fun not having fun at.
I am going to serve raisinets. Ha ha! Aah!
hawk attack.
on the night of the party,
steve was finding out that convincing people
not having fun is not only ironic, but fun,
was ironically not fun.
what's with this party?
steve usually has the best of everything.
do you get it?
irony. Do you get it?
serving the worst of the best.
do you get it?
Oh, oh! - Do you get it?
so how's it going?
I think they're getting it.
I don't know.
that's the thing about irony.
it can be so...
subtle.
but she can't know.
great. - Great.
great party. - Really great.
great. Great.
the only thing your friends are not getting into Is the nonalcoholic beer.
that's 'cause so few of us are nonalcoholics.
Hey, you know what? Since we're having so much fun,
what do you say we crank it up a notch?
what do you mean?
I could still hire a band or Whitney Houston.
that won't be excessive.
she'll never deliver.
or we could get Jake busey to drive your volt Into the pool or something.
I think Jake lives upstairs.
I actually think we've had enough fun.
I think it's about time to put the icing on the cake.
Oh, good, so that's not the icing that we're using
my slideshow.
and that. Yes.
and don't you think it would be better
to start with the funny cake instead of the funny slideshow?
funny? Oh, no, no, It's not funny.
it's about my life in the Amazon-- The hardships, the struggles of the people.
let's put some meat on this bone.
irony is I've been trying to do that Since the day you got here.
Hello, Steven.
how are you finding your party?
because I can't. I shouldn't joke.
I did steal your party theme.
Oh, no, did you go for the discount,
Swizzler, garbage-party theme too?
Oh, god, no. I finally had some sense pecked, scratched,
and clawed into me And realized that people just wouldn't get it.
so I went with my original your original idea
the orgy dome and whatnot.
um, attention, everybody.
I, um-- we all have so much.
but now I would like to show you a presentation
of some people who have so little.
well, I must be going.
I can't keep my ecstatic guests waiting.
Oh, no, wait, Emmy will be devastated.
I'm asking you as a friend,
please just stay till the end of her presentation
and act like you're having a good time at my...
interminaball"? Fine.
I'll be stiffly watching from over there By that coat rack.
I have been living in peru for the last six years,
very far from the comforts And the pampered life of neverwood.
for those of you who have a squeamish stomach,
you may want to step out for the sequence entitled "when left untreated.
lights!
and that's when things went really south.
seven years in the jungle In just under seven hours,
just look at the misery in this impoverished village.
here's some more misery.
here I've got a wider angle of the misery.
and just as the birds regurgitate the worms... - things went from bad to worse.
to feed their young,
here we see the tribes members themselves
regurgitating the birds they've eaten To feed their families.
steve was trying to be a friend,
but he was the only one.
this is a nightmare.
I honestly think you're the only one I can count on as a friend to stick around
you're a balloon!
and then came slide 279.
and so once the weights have been released,
Makunta now sports the pagantu of a man And not the pacunca of a boy.
unfortunately, this one did get infected.
no, no, no, Lights! Lights!
what the hell are you doing?
we are at a party.
no, we're not.
the party's over. There is no party.
well, I hope you're not blaming me for that.
of course I am.
you drove everybody out with slide 279.
it's not my fault if your friends didn't like your party.
of course it's your fault.
I turned myself inside out trying to convince everybody
that this awful party was somehow ironic.
I don't even know what that means!
neither do I, but it happened.
you asked me to do this.
you're the one who wanted to totally change me.
you wanted me in this fancy dress,
so what, I'd fit in with your rich friends
and your fine wines and your fancy breakfasts
and your stupid, big, giant...
Oh, you're not gonna be able to
wow, you are really not tired.
I get a lot of sleep.
well, I guess we were the couple who lost it at the party.
I'm just happy that you're willing To refer to us as a couple now.
I'm not. - I'm kidding. Come on.
I'm sorry.
I think I am still intimidated to be here.
it doesn't matter how many years I've been away.
the second I get back here, it's like I'm the housekeeper's daughter again.
it just brings out the worst in me.
I feel really bad that I ruined Your wonderful party for no good reason
for no good reason.
you didn't ruin it.
honestly, I've never even had fun at these things.
maybe if I'd had you to...
hang out with after?
Yeah.
I'm asking you to change.
so maybe I need to be open To changing a little bit as well.
maybe I need to learn to have a little bit of fun.
I love this idea.
in many ways, I prefer it to me becoming less fun.
what do you say We head over to fa'ad's and have a drink?
I would love that. That'd be a lot of fun.
after all, you sat through half a slideshow About the real Emmy Kadubic.
I should go to a party That shows me the real Steven Wilde.
you're telling me there's another half Of the slideshow that's all about you?
man, I want to learn more.
Hey, lights.
it's human nature to seek even the smallest comfort in reason or logic for events as catastrophic as these.
but a virus doesn't choose a time or place.
it doesn't hate or even care.
it just happens.
go back to your homes!
the Reaper virus spread among the population of Glasgow like a common cold.
there was no stopping it.
no cure. No vaccine.
it claimed the lives of thousands in the first week.
this is the end of the world!
in an attempt to quell the outbreak, martial law was implemented.
roadblocks set up. Curfews enforced.
come on, darling. We have to walk now.
the airports, seaports and borders were closed.
scotland was placed under quarantine.
the people were ordered to stay in their homes, to avoid travel, avoid contact, to sit it out and wait for help that did not come.
stay back!
you got to let us through!
get out of the way! Move! Move! Get out of the way! Walk on, will you?
Hey, you! You! I'm talking at you!
get down on the floor now!
everybody, down!
don't shoot!
you fucker!
fall back! Fall back!
get out of the way!
please let us go!
Onward!
are you all right?
you bastard!
look at me, darling. Look at...
go! Go! Go!
hold the line!
gas!
easy, girl. Come here.
help me!
please! Take us with you!
get back!
we're too heavy! We have to get off now!
step away from the helicopter!
give her a chance!
no, wait! What are you doing?
get back in the helicopter! Now!
take the girl!
we have to go now!
hold tight, sweetheart! Everything's going to be okay!
come on!
stay back!
take this!
so she'll know!
hold on tight, sweetheart!
the wall stood 30 feet high, clad in steel armor plating.
it followed the line of the ancient Roman frontier, 2, 000 years before, spanning 18 miles, east coast to west, cutting Britain in half.
coastal waters were mined and patrolled. The skies were declared a no-fly zone, and orders were given to shoot down any aircraft in violation of the quarantine.
the idea was simple. Nobody came out, and nobody went in.
they needn't have worried about the second part.
those abandoned within the quarantine zone were left to die.
social order decayed along with the corpses.
the streets ran with blood as the people fought to stay alive.
the bodies burned in their thousands. Looting, rape and murder became rife.
fire spread as the cities were plundered, and the last to die became primal savages, feeding on dogs, rats and finally, on each other.
as the weeks turned to months, the funeral pyres faded and died.
in time, all the lights burned out, consigning the country north of the wall first to memory and eventually to history.
but just as the government had turned its back on the hot zone, so the rest of the world turned its back on Britain.
with hundreds of thousands unemployed, homeless and destitute, the situation has reached breaking point.
it now remains only a matter of time before the laws of nature seek to redress the balance.
targets are in play. Start recording.
Sinclair, Richter is the biggest slave trader in the city.
I want him alive.
your call.
me and my boat, marooned on this fucking island 25 years.
it's a full-time job, trying to prevent it falling apart.
come. Mind your head.
best I could find. Straight from the ghetto. Cheap. Clean.
happy?
very.
what the fuck is this?
you prick!
get the case.
drop the gun!
fucking nancy-boy! Where's your partner? Tell me!
I'm getting off this boat alive. You go to hell.
get back! Don't you come any closer, or I'll blow his fucking brains all over this boat!
Sinclair, whatever you do, don't shoot.
what the hell are you doing? Sinclair!
she's fucking nuts! Tell her to back off!
I'm ordering you not to shoot, Sinclair!
Richter, you've got one way out of this!
put the gun down, or she will kill you!
you haven't got a chance!
I'll kill him, I swear! Sinclair, do not shoot!
shit.
I'll never get used to that.
I don't suppose you got a cigarette?
when are you going to buy your own? Do you know how much these things cost?
why do you think I smoke yours?
michaelson was a good man.
not the greatest copper on the beat, but a good man.
what happened in there?
see for yourself.
whatever happened to a good cause?
can't remember what she looked like.
all I have is a name on an envelope and an address of a place I can never go to.
I've watched you fight your way through the ranks, tooth and nail.
and it's made you so full of piss and vinegar.
you carry on the way you're going, you're gonna wind up one seriously fucked-up individual.
now, do me a favor.
please, go home. Get some rest.
okay, let's do it!
get back!
get back!
thank you, Captain, that will be all. Sir.
Canaris. Prime Minister.
how long? Two hours ago.
well? DDS were carrying out a routine drugs raid when they found the infected victims.
it's the Reaper virus. Oh, my God.
it's back.
bloody Hell, George. What's got your knickers in a twist?
national emergency, I'm afraid. Briefing for the PM in five minutes.
let's keep this informal and to the point.
we all know what's at stake, why you're here.
in 2023, when the rising tidal waters were threatening to flood London, we extended the Thames flood barrier.
like a castle moat, this system of canals encircles the entire capital north of the river.
our immediate plan is to flood the canals, blockade all bridges, tube lines and rail links in and out of the city.
you want to put 12 million people under lock and key?
containment is our absolute priority. We must implement martial law now.
keep the people off the streets while we secure the blockade and set up medical stations.
only then can we begin the evacuation. Do it.
it's all very well packing people into their homes like so many million sardines, but you drop a killer virus into that mix, and this town is gonna go tits-up in no short order.
once you start stacking bodies in the streets, there'll be panic, public disorder, looting, rape, murder, and that's just for starters.
the death toll will be unimaginable, and by that time, there'll be absolutely fuck-all we can do about it.
you have to think of the millions that we'll be saving.
are you talking about people? Or pound notes?
chief Nelson, would you join me in my office?
if this is a bollocking, make it quick.
I've got a job to do, I need to be out there on the streets.
what we're about to show you is highly confidential and potentially volatile material.
when the wall went up, the government at that time, naturally, wanted to know what was happening on the other side.
so they re-tasked one of their military satellites to provide coverage of Edinburgh and Glasgow.
for the past 30 years, it's carried on taking pictures, sending down what you'd expect. Empty cities, deserted streets.
that is, until three years ago, when these turned up.
people.
on the streets of Glasgow.
survivors? What else could it be?
and if there are survivors, there must surely be a cure.
what we have to do is get our hands on it.
we already have a team standing by.
all we need is somebody to lead them.
someone to take them in, find the cure and deliver it into our hands before it's too late to turn the tide.
you don't know how many survivors there are.
and the team might not find them in time. They might not find them at all.
and they could still be contagious.
that's what the team's going to find out.
you've known for three fucking years that they were up there, but you swept it under the carpet.
scotland's dead have long since been laid to rest.
yesterday, if I turned up on the 6: 00 news with a survivor in tow, they'd have strung me up from the nearest lamp-post by the balls.
but if, in 48 hours, I arrive with a survivor and a cure, sure they won't give a flying fuck about the survivor, but they'll be lining up to kiss my arse for that cure.
in politics, survival is timing, and ours is running out.
we have 48 hours.
I need your best man on this, right away.
all right.
I know someone who might just fit the bill.
get in the car, it's pissing down.
how long have they known? Long enough.
but that doesn't matter now. Matters to me.
there are survivors out there.
this is not some personal quest I'm sending you on.
focus on your mission. Who's behind it? Hatcher?
Hatcher's got the swagger and the smiles, but it's Canaris who pulls the strings.
he's the power behind the throne.
and he's not someone you want to pick a fight with.
who, me? I'm serious.
if the truth got out, it would bring Hatcher, the government, the whole fucking system down.
and there's no way Canaris is ever gonna let that happen.
once you're over that wall, there's no rules, no backup. Better that way.
look after this for me, would you?
don't suppose you got a cigarette?
there's no smoking on the helicopter, and I don't smoke.
fair enough.
Dr. Marcus Kane, he was leading the research into the virus when the gates were closed.
he was trapped inside the hot zone.
his lab was located inside the quarantine compound in Glasgow.
if anybody was capable of developing a cure, it was him.
I suggest you start at the lab. Pick up the trail from there.
you'll rendezvous with the rest of the team at the wall, then you'll proceed north in two armored transports.
scotland is still Why not fly in? A no-fly zone.
Hatcher needs to keep this as low profile as possible.
so if we don't make it out, no one will know we went in.
you've got 46 hours.
if you don't make it back, the city of London and everybody in it will be left to die.
if it's there, I'll find it.
you'll need this. It's a GPS locator beacon. It'll tell us exactly where you are.
we'll have a gun ship standing by to extract your team.
so much for low profile.
once you have the cure, it won't matter.
what happens if I don't find anything up there?
then you needn't bother coming back.
for your own safety, return to your homes.
east London is under martial law.
what the hell are we going to do, Canaris?
just calm down and listen.
even if, by some miracle,
Sinclair finds what she's looking for and makes it back in time, the fact remains, this is our fault, we made it happen.
too many people crammed into ghettos so tight they can barely move.
we created the perfect breeding ground for a virus to take place.
and the more we save now, the more chance there is of the same thing happening all over again.
now, we have an opportunity to buy ourselves breathing room.
what exactly are you suggesting? We're at war, Prime Minister.
it's basic combat triage.
leave the dying to die.
with the whole world watching?
with a lie this big, we can get away with anything we want.
major Sinclair! Good flight? Fine.
sergeant Norton. Welcome to no-man's land.
why call it that?
there's not another living soul for miles south of that wall, except us.
what about the sentries?
no, the whole system was fully automated about 20 years ago.
nowadays they only expend their ammo on the local wildlife.
a team arrived two hours ago. They're prepping their gear inside.
ask them to get suited up, Sergeant. We're against the clock on this one.
Yes, sir!
has the team been briefed? I've given them their assignments, objectives and the file on Dr. Kane.
major Sinclair. Chandler. Armor division. I'll be your driver today.
Yeah, they may be ugly, but they move like shit off a shovel.
twin V12 engines, two-inch armor plate, and they'll take anything from 30mm rounds to chemical weapons.
just the ticket for a night on the town. Where'd they find these things?
they patrolled the hot zone, just north of the wall.
when the system was automated, most of them were sold off for scrap.
these are the last two in service.
major, meet Corporal Read. Tank driver.
major. Carry on, Corporal.
riflemen. Miller, Carpenter. Major.
what have we got here?
bio suits. Combat model. High impact flexi-polymer.
gives us total freedom of movement and 24-hour protection.
just what a girl needs.
prototype, silicon foam grenade.
this is frontline equipment. A going-away present from Canaris.
are we expecting trouble?
is there a problem? No.
no problem at all, Major.
good.
this is our cargo, Doctors Talbot and Stirling.
you were part of the task force set up to study the virus?
that's right. How do you do, Major?
I took over in '24. Stirling joined me in '31.
until Hatcher, in his infinite wisdom, decided to pull the plug on the whole program three years ago.
tried everything, of course. Just couldn't crack it.
I do hope this trip of yours is worth the risk, Major.
apparently, someone thinks so.
all right, listen up!
I want everyone suited, booted and strapped. Back here in 10.
open the gate!
sentry guns deactivated.
all right, Chandler. Take us in.
shit! Chandler, what was that?
Chandler, why have you stopped?
I think we hit something. Major.
say again? I think you'd better have a look at this.
all right, Miller. Suit up and check it out.
all right. Chandler, send up a flare.
Hey, Chandler, what's black and white and spread all over?
I can't see any damage to the APC, but your cow is a complete write-off.
moo. All right, get back inside.
you know that Dr. Kane was the best man in his field.
his papers on virus research were required reading when I was in medical school.
basically, he taught me everything I know but I never actually met the man.
this file's been closed for 25 years.
the government tried to suppress any information getting out of the hot zone.
didn't want people to know how bad things had got up there.
I don't think we can stay here much longer.
morality has abandoned these people. The killing...
seems he dug in with a bunch of stranded soldiers, fortified the hospital as best they could, kept up regular reports on the army frequency using their coms set till the power went out permanently.
the fires have spread, the power supply is dwindling, and our food and water are running out fast.
at night we can hear the distant cries of pain and anguish.
they've begun to feed off each other.
it's medieval out there.
ammunition is low.
the barricades won't hold out much longer.
our time has run out.
this is Dr. Marcus Kane signing off.
what do the numbers mean?
it's the number of people in each house that needed saving.
they were told to stay in their homes, that help would come.
clear.
Stirling, what do you know about line of fire?
I'm a lab hound, not a combat surgeon.
that's all we need.
line of fire is the air between the target and the weapon through which the bullet travels very fast.
if anything happens, you get behind me quick. Understood?
you wouldn't want me to blow your brains out is what I understood.
stand back.
all right, check your corners.
we're clear.
read, Fresno, we're on the fifth floor, we're going in.
copy that, everything quiet here.
I think the TV's buggered.
Talbot, Stirling. You're up.
how the hell are we supposed to find anything in this mess?
just keep looking.
it would help if we knew what we were looking for.
some evidence of Kane's work. I'll know when I see it.
Thanks. That helps a bunch.
shut it, Carpenter.
major! Major! We got a live one!
Chandler, did not copy! Say again! There's a fucking girl here!
outside on the street!
whatever you do, do not touch her!
Chandler, keep her in sight, but do not approach her.
repeat, do not approach her.
Chandler! What are you doing?
you heard Sinclair! Get back inside! Now!
she needs help, Read, look at her! Chandler, no!
Fresno, get your short, hairy ass back in the vehicle.
Hey, hey. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Whoa!
Chandler! Do you copy? Yeah, she's alive, Major, but only just.
major, she must be isolated so we can examine her.
all right, let's get her inside.
major, this lab looks untouched. Take a look. We're right behind you.
Talbot, get down now! Christ!
shit!
read, emergency EVAC! Now! Copy that!
I've reached Stirling. I need my torch! I need my torch!
major! Checking the back door!
shit!
Chandler get back in the fucking APC now! Okay, I'm moving!
fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
we're rolling!
we're not getting out that way!
Jesus Christ!
burn, you fuckers!
fuck!
Chandler, you're on fire! Don't I fucking know it!
major, we are under attack! I repeat, we are under attack!
bastards!
apc 1 is down!
shit!
repeat, APC 1 is down! We've lost Chandler!
fuck! Get to the elevator, sub level 1.
get in there. It won't work, there's no power!
get the fuck in! Move! Move!
sergeant! Cover fire! Copy!
Miller, foam grenade. Whatever this plan is, make it snappy! Shotgun!
major, what are we doing in here?
going down! Pull it now!
major, you are completely insane!
fuck! Check your corners! Check your corners!
move! Move! Move! Miller, get that fucking hatch open!
Oh, shit!
get in! We've gotta go now!
move it, Read! Go! Go! Go!
is anybody injured? Is everybody okay?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
what the fuck happened back there?
read's got multiple impact warnings.
read! Stop, stop the car!
read! Look out!
Stirling, you still with us? I'm okay, I'm okay.
well, I think I'm not!
what about Read? She's dead!
fuck this shit, man! Fuck it! All right, grab what you can and bail out!
Miller, cover Norton! Covering fire!
wait, wait, wait, tourniquet. I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
Norton, alleyway! Copy!
Stirling, go with him! He needs my help!
get over here! Move it! Go!
get behind me! Miller! Get Talbot!
fuck! Major, go!
major, fucking go!
come on, then, you fuckers!
fuck!
I'm out!
get your hands off me! Talbot! We can't leave him.
go! Go! Go! Move it!
this one's for Sol.
shit, man.
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
I got a bit carried away. But if you keep going on like this...
see? There I go again.
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
but you are making me so fucking mad!
just talk to me.
who are you?
what the fuck is the matter with you? Enjoy pain, is that it?
cause you are fucking asking for it!
norton to Sinclair, Norton to Sinclair, do you copy? Over.
norton to Sinclair, Norton to Sinclair, come in.
sooner or later, you're going to have to consider the possibility that they're dead.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to be blunt, but...
we still have a job to do, with or without Major Sinclair.
Yeah, and right now, my job is you.
if anything happens to you now, Dr. Stirling, we're fucked.
let's try again. Who are you? And where have you come from?
now, I know that Kane didn't send you, so who did?
Where'd you get all the fancy gear from? The tanks. The guns.
talk to me!
did you say Kane?
you need me to speak a little louder? Is that it?
well, how's this?
fuck you!
we came over the wall.
I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it! I knew he was fucking lying!
who was lying? Kane!
you see, the bastard told us there was nothing out there.
no hope of salvation.
but I knew.
I knew that one day someone would come and prove him wrong.
if Kane's alive, I need to find him.
save your breath. You're with us now.
and you're alive only as long as we need you!
well, you see, if you did come over that wall, then you must've planned on getting back.
we've tried before and failed.
I've seen too many of my friends rush those gates, but before they could even get close, they were turned to fire and fell as ash.
but with you here to lead us through, we are going to go all the way.
lady, I could eat you right up.
you should forget about that bastard Kane!
he's history.
but you, you are our passport to the promised land.
I think you're gonna be sorely disappointed.
I'll be the judge of that.
can you hear that?
the hounds are hungry!
it's feeding time at the fucking zoo!
we need this one alive. Make sure she stays that way.
nice watch.
Sol! I heard what you said. I need to speak with you!
you'll get your turn! Sol!
the wind of change is blowing a hurricane!
give them hell!
no, no! No, no! No, no!
ladies and gentlemen! Here he is, the head chef, the big cheese, the sunshine of your lives!
ladies and gentlemen,
I have a rare treat in store for you!
medium fucking rare!
Kane thought he could tell us what to do, and we told Kane, "Fuck you"!
fuck you!
this is our city!
whoever they send here, we're gonna catch them!
we're gonna cook them!
and we're gonna eat them!
eat them, man!
here we go!
No! No! No!
burn him! Burn him!
please! Please! No! No!
get off!
you bitch!
Yes!
if you're hungry, why not try a piece of your friend?
Hey!
what do I have to do to get a drink?
put the key in the lock, and turn it very slowly.
that wasn't so painful, was it?
wait! Get me out of here, and I can help you.
you can help me? Why? What are you offering?
I heard you speaking to Sol.
you said you came through the wall.
no, no, no. Please. Don't leave me here! He'll kill me.
you have to do better than that, I'm afraid.
I can help you find Kane.
you know where Kane is? I should. He's my father.
if I find out you're lying, you'll wish that I'd left you here.
follow me, and you keep your bloody voice down.
look out!
you can let go now.
move it!
come in, Sergeant! Sinclair, this is Norton. Where are you?
on the move! Meet us at the station on Queen Street!
station on Queen Street, copy.
come on.
find her!
come on!
joshua, it's okay!
you can trust her. She looks dangerous.
she is.
Norton, do you copy? Come in.
it looks clear.
go! Go! Go!
when I grab you,
I'm gonna rip your fucking head off! Run, you little fucker!
come on! Come on! Come on!
leg it!
come on!
this way!
fucking move it!
fire up the engine! Norton, if you can hear me, platform 4!
are you coming or not?
come on!
come on! Move it!
get on! You fucker!
come on, Stirling!
No!
come on!
Stirling, get down!
come on!
come on!
move it!
come on! Run, Major! Faster!
come on!
No!
where are you taking us?
somewhere safe for the moment.
sorry to piss in your chips, but we haven't got time to play safe.
you said you'd take us to Kane, and I need to see him now.
I said I would help you find him. I can't take you to him.
why not?
because he will kill me.
and if he finds out where you're from, he'll kill you, too.
ever since Sol left, he's become suspicious of everyone, even me.
his people are too afraid to defy him, and those who dare are tortured or killed.
you're living proof of a world beyond that wall.
all our lives he told us there was nothing out there.
you being here doing in the city?
I went to find my brother. Sol. That maniac is your brother?
that is one fucked up family, man. They're at war.
and we're caught right in the middle.
what is this place?
a shortcut through the mountain. We use it all the time.
looks like an old military facility or something.
whatever it was, they left in a hurry. Didn't even bother to lock the doors.
Jesus, what have they got in here, the Lost Ark?
don't know, mate, but those blast doors are 12 inches thick.
whatever it is, somebody somewhere wanted it kept safe.
somebody's coming.
run.
wait, who or what is Telamon? He's Kane's executioner.
come on. Come on.
come on. You can go, I'm staying.
give me your sidearm, and get out of sight.
you really don't give a fuck, do you?
I think your plan's shit, but I guess I'll stand with you.
there's something you don't see everyday.
No! No! Joshua!
No! No! No!
come on! Come on! Move!
sergeant, put down your weapon.
we need to get to Kane the quickest way possible, and this is it.
Yeah, all right. Fuck it.
I hope you know what you're doing.
wayward daughter returns.
you brought some friends.
came over the wall. We want to see Kane.
I knew they'd be watching the cities.
that's why we chose this place. Out of sight, out of mind.
I suppose it was only a matter of time before they sent someone to answer to the question, "Why are you alive when you should be dead"?
that's what you want to know, isn't it?
Ow! Answer him!
something along those lines.
leave us.
the answer is easy.
in the land of the infected, the immune man is king.
so if this is just a power trip, why stay hidden?
why not show yourselves?
you think we chose to cast off the apparel of our former existence?
no, no, no. We didn't choose anything.
we were delivered.
these walls around you, they were built to last.
and so shall we. What we've built here from the ashes is pure blood, uninfected by the outside world, until now.
have you found the cure?
even now you still cling to hope.
if I were you, I would abandon any such thoughts.
there's always hope. But there is no cure.
there never was.
we had prevailed here, not because of science, but through natural selection. Survival of the fittest.
we have earned the right to live here.
purged of the likes of you.
take them away.
don't you even want to know why we're here?
that you're here at all is sin enough.
it's the Reaper virus. It's back.
and if he touches me one more time, I will kill him where he stands, I swear.
how dare they send you here to ask for my help?
they started this fire.
they can burn in it!
place your right hand on the screen.
now look into the retinal scanner.
we're losing our city.
I better get out there.
it's time to get you out, Prime Minister.
how the hell did this man...
isolate him. Put him in his office, and do it now.
move, sir. I don't understand how I...
keep your distance! Canaris, I...
Canaris! Back away!
good shot.
I was trying to save him!
you brought impurity into our world. You must be cleansed.
do it.
please, Father. Please.
father, please! No!
daddy! No! Daddy!
daddy!
No!
you, turn around.
tie her hands.
Sinclair, what did they call you before they called you Major?
well, Eden, I still think this is a shit plan.
so, tell me.
what's it like out there now?
what do you care?
I'm curious.
same shit, different era.
so we did the right thing, then, eh, by keeping ourselves to ourselves.
don't you mean turning your back? You used to be a doctor.
at what point did you stop caring?
I used to be an idealist, too.
that night that they closed the gates.
that night, I lost everything.
my wife, my family.
you don't know the pain. You chose to stay hidden.
your wife and family could still be out there.
you ever stop to think about their pain?
I haven't slept one night in 25 years without reliving that moment.
who the hell are you to talk to me about pain? What do you know?
what did you ever lose?
bollocks!
daddy wants to see you.
step away!
don't fuck about, mate. I'm not in the mood.
Stirling, get the keys!
back off.
out of the way, you dozy twat!
in there.
doctor, not now.
grenades. Lovely. That'll do nicely. Come on, Doctor!
I'll tell you what I've lost. I've lost my bloody mind.
execute the prisoners! Now!
execute the prisoners! Now!
man the defenses! We're under attack!
that's it.
nice. Yeah? Cool. Come, come, come.
where are they? Where are they?
fuckers!
you, finish her off.
shit.
come on! We have no time!
watch out. Come on. Come on.
get to the horses!
move it! Move it!
come on! Grab the torches!
here you go. Sergeant, jam the door.
go on!
sergeant, check and see if there's a backup generator.
we're gonna need something, and fast.
take your pick.
let's try that box.
No!
well, what are you looking at? Break that fucker down!
whoa. Nice color. I'll take it.
I'll get those fill her up.
where you going? I'm gonna find a phone.
help me with it.
hurry up, you lazy twats!
come on!
perfect.
get in the back! What does it do?
I'll show you what it does.
we got the package. We're on our way.
well, you'd better get here quick.
canaris is in charge now. Hatcher's dead.
put him on.
it's for you.
yes?
you still want your prize? Then follow this signal.
trace the source. Send the coordinates directly to me.
okay, that's it.
let's go.
hold the fort while I'm away.
this is as far as you go. We'll handle it from here.
Un-bloody-believable!
fuck, yeah!
put your foot down!
I'm tired of running from these bastards.
hold on!
Yeah!
step on it!
fucker!
shit! Jesus.
too fucking close.
you think?
hold on, we're going for a ride.
are you out of your fucking mind?
fuck!
here they come.
come on!
No!
No! No! No!
No! No!
please.
please stop! You'll kill us.
get off of her, you bitch!
you like pain? Yeah.
have some of this!
put your foot down!
no.
No! Oh, shit.
No! Stop!
you dirty fuckers!
fuck!
shit!
what the fuck's going on, Sinclair?
they want my cure.
major Sinclair.
you had me worried for a while.
do you have it?
I've got it.
Where's the medical team?
let's not make this difficult. You've done a good job.
we'll take it from here.
Stirling, bring her out.
you have to forgive Stirling. He's very involved with his work.
okay. Let's go.
we understand the need for sacrifice.
the longer we leave it, the better shape we'll be in once the dust settles.
once the virus has eaten away the dead flesh, then we'll make our move.
just a question of timing. Making you the hero of the hour.
you said you had the cure. Where is it?
she's the cure. The survivors are immune.
we can use her blood to make a vaccine.
hand her over. She's not going anywhere without me.
captain. Get behind me.
hand her over now.
go with them.
I don't trust him.
there's no choice. So that's it?
I've got nothing left to bargain with.
I've done my job.
now it's your turn. A lot of good people died for this!
is that all it was to you?
a job?
that's right.
now, take her and go.
rough ride? Rough enough.
don't suppose you've got a cigarette?
come with me. I'll get you all the cigarettes you want.
pity. I could have used someone like you.
she's so beautiful.
you okay?
never better.
how'd you find me?
I used to be a policeman once.
I don't need it anymore.
Really?
did Canaris get what he wanted?
he did.
I have a feeling he'll be holding onto it for awhile.
shit.
don't worry.
he gave me something in return.
all the evidence you'll need to bring Canaris down.
he will come after you.
well, then he'll know where to find me.
come on.
just do me one favor. Drive careful.
be lucky.
the longer we leave it, the better shape we'll be in once the dust settles.
once the virus has eaten away the dead flesh, then we'll make our move.
making you the hero of the hour.
if you're hungry, try a piece of your friend!
I don't think it's working out.
what isn't working out? - Us.
andrea michele, the client.
am I getting my ass whipped?
not that I don't like that.
you need to tone it down.
now I'm horny.
united states coast guard auxiliary.
a volunteer component of the coast guard. - Let's go.
I get seasick, but whateve oh, we're gonna be in the military.
already my penis feels bigger.
a court-appointed, indigent client--check forgery.
I should be able to manage that.
Yes, manage it quickly, please, so we can put you on a case that might actually make this firm some money.
hello.
dear Maureen, "being with you is being.
thinking about the last time we madlove,
I feel both a total sense of peace "and a voracious hunger.
when I am on you, I am. Meet me.
that's sweet, but I'm not Maureen.
I'm Maureen.
guess who wrote this.
the suspense is simply more than I can bear.
my pastor.
we had an affair.
and this is one of the letters he wrote while we were together.
I loved hiM.
he dumped me.
I want to sue him.
Clarence. - Yes.
this is Maureen.
she loves her pastor.
Clarence will help you. Pay no attention to his shifty eyes.
hello.
who are you? - Who are you?
busy.
Andrea.
my friends call me the beav.
uh, oh, yes. I remember you.
you're the one that sued over the nuclear power plant.
well, what is it today, beav?
Congratulations.
who's the lucky troop ship?
funny. Got a first name?
extremely.
extremely busy.
hold o I bring business.
this ring is a zirconium.
it's supposed to be my mother.
you're very tall, by the way.
I sent her ashes to a company that takes out the carbon, heats it up, smashes it down and turns it into a memorial diamond.
but this, as I said, is not a diamond.
it's a cubic zirconium.
I've been defrauded.
I'm looking for a tall, distinguished yet privately debauched attorney to satisfy the beav, and you're it.
Hello, mr. Morris. I'm katie lloyd. I'll be representing you.
Leo.
Aries.
now we've got that out of the way.
no, my name is leo.
Oh, I beg your pardo um...
I see yore charged with felony forgery, and there appears to be ample evidence.
well, that's only because I did it.
Oh, I see. Do you-- do you have a reason?
I do. I'm dying.
you don't look it.
you got me.
I'm not, and there in lies the problem.
you seem confused.
I'd be glad to explain over dinner.
how about you do so now?
okay.
are you familiar with viatical settlements?
a termally ill person signs over his life insurance policy for up-front cash...
and when that person dies, the company collects the policy's full death benefit.
Yes. Four years ago, I was diagnosed with A. I.D. S.
bad blood transfusion.
he adds to assure me he's straight.
anyway, I-I didn't respond to any of the medications, none.
my "t" cells plummeted, my viral load soared.
I couldn't work. I had no savings.
I needed money to live on.
well, to die on.
so you sold your life insurance policy?
Yeah, they gave $40, 000 and agreed to cover my health and life insurance benefits for the rest of my life, which seemed to be a few months away.
but then these new treatments came out.
they call them rescue drugsfor A. I.D. S. Patients who don't respond to normal medicationsand turned things around.
great for me. I get to live.
not so great for the viatical company which promised to pay for my health insurance for the rest of my life.
and now they want out of the deal?
and I still need the deal.
basically, if I don't get the right treatment, I die.
so I took one of their checks, made counterfeits and started paying the premiums that way.
evidently that's a crime?
well, I've been assigned by the court to your case, so...
I'm in luck.
I told him to get rid of it, but he didn'T.
what do you expect me to do?
backstop him.
help make it go away.
she's suing her pastor for dumping her?
that's ridiculous.
Ah, of course it is.
this is the firm where ridiculous...
excuse me.
hello.
need something?
what are you doing?
mouth to mouth
coast guard training.
we need to know C. P.R.
no tongue.
I've saved you some time.
I've called the president of the company that makes these rings, and he's agreed to come here and meet with you.
you should be on your knees thanking me.
win us the case, and I'll get down on mine.
well, had she been drinking or
no, no. It was a school day.
she had been up the prior night studying for a test.
earlier that week, she had pulled an all-nighter to finish a paper.
they think she fell asleep at the wheel.
how can I be of help, mrs. Joseph?
I believe that my daughter was hugely sleep deprived as a result of both stress and workload.
I partly blame myself for even letting her drive because I knew how tired she was, but...
she wouldn't be dead if it weren't for the...
I want to sue her high school.
you can't use a snorkel, man.
why not?
well, they won't let you.
we're supposed to be able to save people.
you look like you need to be rescued.
Denny, I'm afraid of the water.
don't say that to the coast guard!
they won't let you in, man.
what's his problem now?
I have no idea.
they'll drop the charges, just like that?
no, not just like that.
it took a phenomenal bit of lawyering on my part.
and it's conditioned on the viatical company agreeing not to press charges.
I have a settlement conference scheduled for tomorrow at 10: 00.
well, what's your cause of action?
emotional distress.
for a break up?
well, this was her ptor.
there may be a special duty of care, like with a therapist.
I don't know, clarence.
well, I might as well tr what's to lose?
honestly?
your career.
I don't mean to be harsh, but if you want to advance here, taking cases that waste the firm's time and resources isn't the best way to accomplish that.
Carl's not happy you ran with this.
he'll be happy if we get something.
you okay?
so talk to me. What's the matter?
it's not a new discussion.
the cases we...
I've got Clarence and Lorraine handling a woman who's suing because her pastor dumped her.
Katie is taking care of a court-appointed matter.
Denny and Alan are very busy trying to join the coast guard.
your friend andrea wants me to sue some crematorium for turning her mother into a cubic zirconium.
i-it seems like every case we do.
Carl. Sorry.
I just took a client.
her daughter was killed in a car wreck, and she wants to sue her high school for wrongful death, claiming they made her kid sleep deprived.
I just couldn't say no to the woman.
sorry.
that's who we are carl.
would you like to lighten the mood by talking about us?
sure.
have you really been that unhappy?
I think...
when people become parents, their personal lives get pushed to the back burner, where they sit dormant for years.
husbands and wives become ancillary to each other, 'causing many a marriage to fail.
mine did, as did the dozen or so of yours.
funny.
you and I are very compatible, Shirley.
we like the same movies, we go to museums together.
we just make splendid company when we're not off independently doing our own things.
and we make excuses for the lack of...
let's call it heat.
we're not that old, Shirley.
and sexually, you are still a beautiful, passionate woman.
I'm still capable of passion, without medication even.
I mean, these are the years when our personal lives should be very much on the front burner again.
and with you and I, together...
they're not.
which brings me back to you deserve more, and so do I.
does that make sense?
a little too much, actually.
Shirley, I've represented you.
I now need you to represent me.
Why?
it's possible I might be disqualified from the coast guard cause I'm afraid of water.
I want to sue under the americans with disabilities act.
I think not.
an egregious wrong by your client has resulted in a great spiritual loss to miss janely.
they banged, he bailed, she bruised.
we're prepared to go forward with this.
but we're willing to entertain a settlement offer.
would we be here if he'd kept on slapping her sheets?
it wasn't cheap and ugly.
it was a profound love.
tell her.
I was...
intoxicate I was powerless.
did you love me?
no.
but.
it was lust.
what we were doing s a sin and had to stop.
and I couldn't leave my wife and marry you just for the lust.
that would just be sinning against you even more.
W-w-well, what do I do now?
if I don't have you, what do I do?
she was taking four A. P.Courses.
she was involved in at least 15 activities.
this was by her choice.
well, it was and it wasn'T.
she saw everybody else doing it, and she didn't want to lag behind.
I-it--it just seems there's this frenzy, be it S. A.T. Scores or getting into the best college, and the kids, even the ones who get a's like samantha, feel they can ways do more.
and you blame the school?
well, I-I realize that some of it comes from the parents.
we all want our kids to succeed, but...
but most of the pressure comes from their peers.
and certainly the schools can see the stress.
it's widespread.
do the parents see the stress?
Yes, and I did.
but how do you get your kid to decompress when she feels that if she doesn't take four A. P.Courses, if she doesn't succeed in sports, if she isn't involved in school government, then she can forget about going to a selective college?
after all of her activities, she would come home from school at 9: 00 or 10: 00, only then to start her homework.
now these schools need to set limits, and they don'T.
did you?
sometimes.
and I regret it.
if I had her back, I would say, "honey, let's go to the beach or take a hayride or build a snowman or..."
my god, these kids don't even go on spring break these days.
they use the time to visit colleges or take S. A.T. Courses.
I'm sorry, judge.
I know that you don't want tears, but--but we put too much on these kids.
they don't sleep.
and my baby's dead because of it.
good morning.
my name's Katie Lloyd.
I represent Leonardo Morris.
Yes, we've actually met before.
how are you, Leo?
alive.
I can be such a killjoy.
and I'm Bob Winthrop, the C. E.O. Of living securities.
Katie Lloyd. - Pleasure.
first, let me say, Mr. Morris, we are happy for your recovery.
I've met with the district attorney.
I suspect she'd agree not to prosecute on the check forging if you agree not to press charges.
done.
Really? - Of course.
and I assume you'll agree not to pursue us civilly.
I can't do that.
you entered into a contract to pay for my health insurance.
you breached it.
that contract presumes a meeting of the minds.
clearly there wasn't here.
how do you figure? - Leo.
she asks.
well, uh, I don't want to sound like ghoul, but that contract presumes you'd be dead within six months.
as it turns out, you could live forever.
that was you not wanting to sound like a ghoul?
look, everybody knows what viatical companies do.
we buy life insurance policies from dying people.
he presented himself as a dying man.
he didn't die.
what did you do with my mother?
well, as I was explaining to Mr. Sack, uh, despite our best efforts to provide you with a carbon, cremain-based gem
Yeah, where is she?
we encountered a glitch.
if you'll refer to the contract, "in the event of a material processing complication, "life-jewel guaranteesa-a substitute of equal or greater value.
cubic zionium is of greater value than ashes.
what, are you kidding me?
I'll gladly provide you a full refund.
I want you to refund me my mother, her ashes. - Plus...
$25, 00
well, we'll see you in court.
wait. Now let's just hold on a second. - Of course we're not going to accepthat insulting offer.
Andrea, look- - here's a guarantee, mr. Parkes
call your lawyer. We will see you in court.
go on. Go.
what?
you're upset with me.
I'm upset with myself for being manipulated.
look, uh, may I call you "extremely," though it's a funny first name?
call me carl, beauty.
you know, you need to loosen up a little.
now how often does it happen that an oversexed woman barges in with a cubic zirconium, complaining that it's not her mother?
W-what do you mean, I have no case?
well, Maureen, courts don't intervene in failed romances.
to give another person one's love, that's everything, isn't it?
it is, but when one enters into a love affair, he or she assumes the risk of a broken heart.
can't you do anything?
because of what he did, I no longer even believe in god.
this just isn't fair.
you no longer believe in god?
no. How could I?
look, kids are raised with the mind-set now...
forget about love of learning, it's get into the trophy college.
all I ever hear about is how our kids don't learn, how r education system is failing.
it is.
getting the grade is not the same as learning.
in fact, sometimes they're mutually exclusive.
the kids have mastered test taking.
it's memorization.
they forget it as soon as the exam's over.
moreover, the competition has created a culture of cheating.
it's all about getting the advantage.
and it's every bit as bad as mrs. Joseph suggests.
what do we do about it?
well, in my thinking, it does start with the parents.
they see dad-- now mom and dad-- competing in the workplace, maximizing career opportunities, exploiting any edge they can get.
we live in a society that likes to keep score.
it happens in life.
it's going on in the home, and--and we can't stop it from happening in the schools.
how about not offering the A. P.Courses?
we do that, and the kids leave in droves and find someplace that does offer them.
stress-management classes?
we've got them.
the kids don't have time to schedule them in.
limiting the amount of extracurricular activities?
well, it sounds good.
problem is, when it comes time apply to college, our kids compete with kids from other schools.
what you're suggesting is we take away their ability to compete fairly.
how do we do that? We put a big sign saying, "if you want to go to harvard, don't enroll here"?
Yes. It doesn't have to be Harvard.
tell that to the parents.
well, somebody's got to take the lead here.
how?
should we say, "don't aim for the top"?
how about let's redefine what the top is?
but it's the kids who define it.
does getting into a select college mean they have a better chance of achieving success or happiness?
no. - Well...
maybe you should start by telling them that.
even assuming you really are willing to go to jail on the fgery.
if I can't afford my medications, my lifespan gets pretty short.
prison doesn't really scare me.
you'd be dead long before this could ever get to trial, so why should we be scared of a lawsuit?
his estate can sue for wrongful death.
Oh, come on.
look, we make it possible for terminal people to enjoy some quality of life.
by betting on their death.
you don't know my business, counsel.
I will make it a point, sir, for the jury to know your business.
they will learn that your industry is rife with corruption, that it's largely unregulated by the S. E.C.
that a grand jury indeed found that up to 50% of viatical agreements may indeed have be procured by fraud.
look, you don't have-- - and while you entice investors by convincing them they're making a humanitarian investment that will turn a huge profit, you currently have no fewer than 11 lawsuits filed against you by these investors, who've yet to see any of the giant returns you guaranteed.
my investors have done just fine, thank you.
in the '80s perhaps, when A. I.D. S.Victims paid off by dying quickly.
you bought my client's policy when he was circling the drain.
you made what you thoughtwas a sure bet, and now that it's turned out otherwise, you renege.
you've breached a contract, mr. Winthrop, and in so doing, have me it impossible for my client to afford his medication.
you very well may hasten his death, but they,
I'm sure the jury will find you quite sympathetic.
okay, that was good.
thank you.
so where do we go from here?
well, hopefully they'll make us an offer.
I mean you and me.
you got me all excited about living another 40 years or so.
did I?
if only I'd known getting arrested could have such an upside.
all the crimes I could have committed.
Leo, I-I represent you, so it would be extremely unethical to-- for me to kiss you.
so now you're in trouble.
big trouble.
I bett go.
uh, you'll call?
what's wrong with you calling?
no, I meant if we get an offer.
I'll definitely be calling.
night, Leo.
night.
thank you for coming back.
Reverend Joyner, I just want to extend my apologies.
it was wrong for my client to sue you.
I must confess I hadn't properly reviewed the facts, but now that I have, we'll be withdrawing our claim forthwith.
what?
is this a trick?
no, it's not a trick, ms. Path I quite properly realized it shouldn't be kurt who maureen sues, but rather the church.
what? Why?
well, your relationship began with you as her pastor.
you were acting as an agent of the church.
nice try.
you can't sue a church for a broken heart, twiggy.
the claim would be loss of faith.
the reverend has caused my client to lose her faith in god.
that's ridiculous.
is it now?
I suspect not to Kurt.
I had opportunity to read several of his sermons, many of which eloquently convey how love and faith are inextricably, indelibly woven together.
whoever does not love does not know god because god is love.
that's beautiful.
Yes, we quite rightly will be pursuing the church now.
they're a much deeper pocket, by the way.
Oh, and thank you for categorizing your feelings as lust.
it will help with liability, though I'm not se your congregation will be pleased to learn their pastor is a sinner.
look, maybe we can just settle this.
no, we can'T.
I can't have the church dragged into this.
she's extorting you, Kurt.
she's just trying to scare you so youl quit fighting.
is god a quitter?
no.
I need more conviction, Kurt.
is god a quitter?
no.
what would jesus do, Kurt?
he'd fight back.
Jesus wasn't a baby, was he, Kurt?
no.
Jesus would get her.
that's what he'd do.
he'd get her.
we're not settling.
what kind of preposterous nonsense is this?
that's the kind of nonsense we specialize in, judge.
but as preposterous as it is, these companies actually exist.
they convert the remains of people into diamonds.
this firm, however, lost the ashes of my clients mother, and instead proffered a cubic zirconium.
it isn't right.
I don't really care.
why should a court take up its valuable time with something so...
so...so...
because it matters, judge.
cases likehis really do matter.
are you going to make me tell you why?
Yes.
okay.
I'm a great believer in capitalism.
it fuels our competitive edge, it's the lifeblood of our economy.
but it also can bring out some of our most disgusting tendencies.
and nowhere are we more exploitative, more disgusting, more soulless than we are in the death business.
get them when they're grieving.
whether it's the solid mahogany coffin, the choicest plot, the marble tombstone
if you truly loved a lost one, you should pay through the nose to show it.
and they come up with ingenious, creative new ways profit off grief, like these diamond rings.
it's so easy to bilk people in their weakest emotional states.
they'll pay a higher price, they'll sign a misleading contract, they won't scrutinize the fine print.
my god, who first came up with, "let burn the bodies and sell urns"?
the truth is, we are so desperate to hold on to our loved ones, we'll do anything.
my client sought to hold on to her mother with a ring.
they lost the ashes, they breached the contract, then tried to defraud her with a cubic zirconium.
and with that, I think our time has come to take advantage of them.
$750, 000?
I think we have to take it.
and they'll waive the forgery charges?
they will. You'll have a check this week.
what can I say? Marry me.
then half the money would be mine, I suppose.
you know, once this case is over, I won't be a client anymore.
n-no, you won't.
you'll be free to do whatever.
I suppose I will.
but... you shouldn't do it here.
we've all heard the moans of the modern-day high school teacher
my kids aren't motivated, they don't want to learn.
A-anthat's real, but we got another epidemic, especially in the middle-class, upper-class and affluent schools.
it's called teenage depression.
a recent study at the centers for disease contro found that 17% of kids in grades 9 through 12 have seriously considered suicide.
what? 17%?
it is now the third leading cause of death for teenagers.
some experts say drowsy driving is as deadly as drunk driving.
80% of teenagers today are sleep deprived.
this now, when we're learning that losing sleep causes a multitude of medical issues, not just depression, but anxiety, weakening of the immune system, A. D.H. D.
high-stress teens are twice as likely to smoke, drink, use drugs.
what the hell is going on?
our kids are overstressed, overscheduled because it's all about getting the gre, getting into a good college.
Oh, they're arriving at college, by the way--fried.
princeton is now considering recommending a gap year between high school and college because freshmen are showing up burned out, in no condition to learn.
why in god's name do we have to teach A. P.Courses in high school?
these are college courses.
what ever happened to wting for college?
and the answer can't be, "we have to offer them 'cause other schools are.
and for all the work those stressed-out kids are doing, there's no correlation between happiness, success and getting into the right school.
none.
meanwhile, they're missing out on fun, downtime, beina teenager.
it's taking a physical and emotional toll.
the neuroscience on multitasking shows it hurts the brain.
it dumbs us down.
all this stuff our kids are doing to get ahead is setting them back.
Samantha Joseph ended up dead.
this is a much bigger picture than high school.
it's our nation's power culture today.
do everything it takes to get ahead.
the athletes take steroids, the students pop adderall, our elected officials engage in dirty politics
it's all about winning.
and parents?
they want their kids to win.
there may be no correlation between success and harvard, but they want their kids to wear the crimson just the same.
they look at their friends' kids, their neighbors' kids, and they want their own kids to be better than because we are a nation of winners.
Samantha Joseph perhaps died in part because she was doing too much, trying to succeed in a competitive world.
and yet ask any parent what they want most, it's "prepare my teen to succeed in a competitive world.
people today with A. I.D. S.Can live a-a long time, but...
many more die quickly, and it is not a fun death.
is death supposed to bfun?
love is.
have you considered, if this worked out, you couldn't have a biological child with him without risking A. I.D. S.To both yourself and the baby?
might you let us have a single date before counseling me on marriage?
relationships start with a single date.
I'm not your mother, but since your parents are in england and I'm the one that hired you,
I would ask you to think very carefully about this.
common sense can be an ugly beast sometimes, can't it?
Judas priest.
too patriotic?
what a suck up.
there's my little litigator man.
Scute. - Andrea.
Andrea, by some miracle, the judge ruled in our favor, which means, oh, joy, we get to keep handling this megacase.
speaking of trials of the century.
Clarence, lorraine, please tell me you got a settlement from the pastor.
we're working on it.
working on it.
here she comes.
I have truly wonderful news.
after kurt's disgusting behavior yesterday, I confronted him.
we got into a big fight, all kinds of emotions poured out.
sum total-- he still loves me.
we're back together.
I'm dropng the suit.
thank you all so, so much.
Oh, great!
we came out of it with a thank-you.
golly gee.
okay, here's the deal-- you need serious help.
that was a good thing that just happened out there.
two people in love got back together--that's a victory.
the fact that you can't see past the bottom line to appreciate that
you got a problem.
I appreciate it when I fall in love.
as for Maureen's bliss-- - oh, wait. When was the last time that happened?
that would be none of your business.
Yes, it is my business, because I want to go out with you.
I'm barely just getting out of a relationship.
Oh, a faux relationship.
we both know that. Even Shirley does.
aside from all of the sexually transmitted diseases I'd be exposing myself to
Oh, that's funny.
my sex is safe, partner.
Oh, there I go, calling you "partner" already.
okay, here's the deal-- when I am not in a relationship, I am prone to a few hollow thrills.
but when I'm in one, I am totally, unflinchingly monogamous.
you need somebody like me. You know youO.
and you like me.
why else would you have taken my stupid case?
I think you need to leave now.
I'm not leaving.
I'll call security. - Go ahead. Tell 'em to bring backup.
I read a book called "doing school" by denise pope.
I found it spot-on.
every parent should read it.
kids "do" school today.
it's not about learning.
it's piling up achievements that look good on the college A. P.
and it's gotten way, way out of hand.
and you know what as a society get out of it?
a nation of test takers, club presidents and volleyball captains.
but we're losing the innovators, the free thinkers, the dreamers.
we lose our values-- honesty, integrity, aracter.
a bunch of outcome-oriented kids are being led by outcome-oriented teachers who are pushed by goal-driven parents.
and 20% of today's teenagers experience depression, and a large percentage of them, like ms. Rome says, attempt suicide.
we need to get it together, fast.
I feel the high school is more likely in a better position to remedy this than the parents.
I'm going to allow this case to go forward.
we're adjourned.
well, thank you.
this is just the start, Carolyn.
it figures to be a very long journey.
Yes, yes, and I'm prepared to take it.
are you with me?
I am.
okay, next up-- alan shore, you'll be rescuing Mr. Crane.
Oh, god help me.
okay, we ready?
maybe I could rescue him by persuading him not to jump in.
go!
try not to drown me.
okay, Mr. Shore, go.
not everybody can get in the water. Somebody's got to drive the boat.
I don't see why I couldn't just drive the boat.
go! - Oh, dear.
get 'em out.
we'll never get in now.
Oh, shut up.
Where's my money?
I was in the neighborhood and thought
well, actually, I wasn't in the neighborhood.
I had to fight like hell through traffic to get here.
but now that I am here...
what?
I spent a rather long night of the practical soul.
I don't fare very well against practical.
I don't think it would be a great idea for me to fall in love with you, Leo.
and I fear if I were to spend time with you, I'd have no choice.
I realize I'm guilty of a bigotry.
but as bigotries go, one of the more reasonable ones.
you're an incredible man.
I just don't think I can go where this would inevitably lead.
Yeah, it was pretty selfish of me to expect otherwise.
no, it's just- - katie...
I get it.
um, Andrea was in my office not long ago.
she got down on one knee and asked for permission to marry you.
she'd be good for you, Carl.
hasn't even been a day yet, and you're pimping me out.
I'm jealous actually.
but part of being grown-up, I suppose.
we just broke up, for god sake.
nobody's that much a grown-up.
I guess not, but...
I agree with what you said, and I actually do think andrea would be great for you.
and believe it or not, I really do want you to be happy.
she thinks I'm cute.
you are cute, Carl.
you are incredibly cute.
I can still taste the chlorine in my lungs.
Oh, you're being a baby.
it's gonna be on our military record forever, you ow?
we can retake the test. - I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
Oh, shut up.
what's the big deal, anyway? - It's a big deal.
if you don't finish at the top of your class, you don't make the short list for officer material. You don't make officer
well, aren't you just one fat microcosm of society?
get ahead. 'S just like whitney's case.
all these high school kids- - how do you know about whitney's case?
I know because I take time out to talk to my neighbors.
maybe you should try that during one of your sexual solicitations.
go night for a jump. You first.
Oh， shut up.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I screwed up the...
swim test.
I don't like to fail.
I won't even try something if I think there's a risk of failure.
that's absur -no, it isn't.
we're Americans. We're winners. That's our culture.
Weeclare victory even if we lose. That's who we are.
well, maybe we all need to be a little more humble.
I don't like fighting.
neither do i.
it's not healthy to go to bed angry at somebody.
especially when it's your best friend.
why don't we just get it over with?
I feel better.
so do I.
sleep over?
I knew it.
forget it, Denny.
one hug, right into the sack.
I said forget it.
it's not that I don't like them, but they need to be special.
if you have them all the time, they lose their specialness.
they're always special to me.
next time I'll eat something spicy.
the gas will make me buoyant.
they had to pull us to shore.
you were gurgling. - I wasn't.
I heard it.
it was like two beached whales.
Oh, we're pathetic.
I thought you were giving me the heimlich.
Oh, stop it.
open the door! Open the door!
Oh, my gosh, what is the matter?
I don't know what happened. - Are you OK? Erin...
all right.
there you go, Miss. Thank you.
Oh, sorry. Ma'am, I'm so sorry. Are you all right?
are you all right?
wait, they're not boarding in there yet.
come on!
excuse me, I'm sorry. Have you seen this woman?
I don't think so. - Are you sure?
Yeah, pretty sure. - No?
Dino. - Yes, sir.
guys, have you seen this woman?
isn't she blonde, with short hair maybe? - Thank you.
stop the bus! Boston PD.
excuse me.
Hey! Stop the bus! Open up!
folks, we'll be stopping for 15 minutes here in Southport.
do you have any fresh coffee?
it's so thick, it tastes like lukewarm mud.
I don't know what to tell you, ma'am. - You're gonna have to throw it out.
it's a fresh Ethiopian blend. -It's not.
I've never tasted Ethiopian that tasted like that in my life.
it's Ethiopian. Yeah. - It's Ethiopian?
just the mud for you then?
that'll be 97 cents.
out of one.
thank you. - Thank you.
and I wish they would, you know, take us to places that...
here you go, Kevin. - Thank you.
Hey, you catch the game? Patriots killing 'em.
Hey, we got security footage from the bus station.
want me to take a look at them? - No, I got it.
all right. Have a good one, buddy.
see ya.
OK, how many in your party, three? OK.
excuse me. - Yes?
is your owner available?
I'm the owner. How can I help you?
uh, do you guys have any job openings?
uh, well, we've been awfully busy lately. I might can work you in.
I'm not sure. Do you have any experience?
so sorry. Frankie!
Yes, I have experience.
I'll be damned.
don't hover at the tables.
make sure their glasses are always filled. Hi, Mary Ann.
and ask 'em if they need something, but don't ask more than once.
when you hear this ding try to beat me up here more times than I beat you.
perfect size for you.
it's got hardwood floors, some wainscoting.
it's a great location to town.
a little bit of a fixer-upper, but it's got a lot of potential.
what do you think?
I'll take it.
Josh!
two feet on the dock, I'm not gonna tell you again.
Hi. - Hi.
um, are your mom and dad around? - Um, no, but I can help you.
you looking for anything?
well, now that you ask... do you have any paint?
um, we have this book that's with all different kinds of colors that you can get.
Oh, really? Oh, that would be great. - What are you painting?
I'm painting my kitchen floor.
the floor? - Why is that funny?
cause you usually don't paint floors.
you usually put a rug on them.
well, I'm thinking that I want to brighten the place up, so...
what's a happy color? What could I do? - Hm... there's yellow.
yellow? - Yeah. The color of the sun.
OK, that is happy. I think you just sold me on that. All right.
I can go get some samples of it. I'm Lexie.
OK, I'm Katie. - Hi, Katie.
thank you.
lower on three. One, two, three.
I'll just... I'll grab the rest.
what, you're still here? - Mm-hm.
let me, uh... let me check you out.
it's just that usually people are just passing through, you know?
it's kind of a pit stop. Ten minutes is usually enough. All right.
I like it. - Yeah?
found it!
thank you. - No, no, that's not for...
you're painting something?
Yeah, she needs to paint her floors in her kitchen.
Ah, OK.
Yeah, I can take them home? - Yeah, yeah, take it home.
pick out your color and we'll... we'll order it up for you.
thank you. - All right.
Thanks, Lexie. - All right, there you go.
rice. Ah, Basmati, the king of rices. - Yum.
good catch.
light bulb, ding! - Tuna.
tuna. - Soap.
soap. - And that'll be 18 even.
OK, thank you.

two dollars is your change. We have some books down here. They're free.
people just leave them on vacation, so...
Yeah. You can take a book.
all right. Well, thank you, Lexie.
thank you. - Bye!
grab a book.
Yeah, they're really good books. - How do you know?
you didn't read any of them.
Bye.
you want me to go get Josh? - Yeah, go grab Josh, will you?
Josh! - "The king of rices"?
Hey, Maddie. - Hey, Rhett.
how are we doing? - Hey, Bass.
Hey, are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine. - Y'all looking for somebody?
Yeah, I sure am.
got a white Honda Civic parked in a handicapped space outside.
you wouldn't happen to know the owner, would you?
I sure don't. Can't help you there.
you got our lunch?
Katie! You got the chief's order?
sorry it took so long. - Oh, no problem at all.
can I help you?
Oh! Uh... You scared me.
uh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be snooping. Um...
I wish I had a good excuse, but it's just idle curiosity.
you're the first neighbor I've had out here in ages.
Yeah, my realtor said I didn't have close neighbors.
Oh, well, I'm not close by city standards.
I'm Jo, by the way.
Katie. - Nice to meet you. Um...
look, I moved out here same reason as you, I think.
to get some peace and quiet, so I get it if you just...
Yeah, I like the fact that I can hear myself think.
Yes, thank you.
I mean, isn't it so nice to be away from all that noise and that chatter?
I mean, it can be a little bit deafening sometimes, so it is...
...it is nice to meet somebody as rustically inclined as I am.
Yeah. OK. - All right, well, it was nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too. - I'm down the road if you need anything.
I'm stronger than I look. So, if you get in any trouble...
OK. - OK, I'm sorry again.
it's OK. - OK.
walk safe. - Thank you.
all right.
how many stops are on your route from here to Atlanta?
to Atlanta? Um... - Yeah.
quite a few. I wouldn't know offhand. - You got a ballpark?
come on, buddy. You gonna buy a ticket or what?
uh, no, I'm not gonna buy a ticket, but I can help you. I can help you out.
uh... Can we open another window for my friend here?
beautiful. Thank you.
OK, so... - The whole Eastern Seaboard.
Yeah. Down to Atlanta. What happens in Atlanta?
well, where do you want to go?
where can you go from Atlanta? - Anywhere.
atlanta's our southern hub.
there are routes to every city in America from there.
Hey, everything OK? - Shit.
job just got a little harder, that's all.
Hey. - Hey, Lexie.
haven't seen those kids in ages. - How are you?
they're growing up so fast. - Good.
whatcha doing? - I'm drawing.
yeah? Drawing, what are you drawing?
I don't know yet.
hm. It looks sorta like a... carrot.
no. - No?
you need to bring 'em by and let me see 'em all, I miss 'em.
maybe this weekend, all right? - All right.
is it a dragonfly?
no, it's a flying fish.
need a bag? - No, no, thanks.
OK.
a flying fish. Now I see it. - Well, hi, Katie.
Hey.
see ya.
Thanks. - Bye-bye.
I see you're a true artist. You got blue all over your hands.
that stupid door. Use the other one. - I'll just go out this one.
OK. See ya. Come see me. - OK. I'll see ya.
Hi.
Oh, hey.
so, I picked out a color from these samples and I'm thinking
I might go with lemon twist.
OK. You're gonna paint the floors yellow?
Yeah, why not? - You sure about that?
Yeah, of course, it's happy. - No, it's a good idea. OK.
how much?
uh, probably a gallon. - A gallon?
Yeah, a gallon. - OK, that should be...
you know, I'll put the order in now. Hopefully, we can get it back by Monday.
great. Thanks. - All right. Lemon twist.
lemon twist. All right.
I'm gonna need a name and a number so that I can call you when the order comes in.
my name's Katie and no number. I'll just stop by Monday.
OK. I'm Alex, so you know who to ask for when you come back.
this is Roger, we're usually around here.
Hi.
all right. - Is that it?
that's it.
OK, great, bye.
when did we start selling paint?
today.
Ooh, the drawing looks good.
thank you. Would you like it?
Really? - Yeah, I can just make another.
Aw, you're so sweet. Thank you. I love it.
give me a hug. All right.
Thanks. Have a good day. - You, too.
Katie! Wait up.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. You might not want the company, but I'm headed home.
I thought we might walk together.
Yeah, sure. - Yeah? Oh, good.
good, it'll keep me from peeking into stranger's windows.
it's a habit I'm trying to break.
that and snapping my gum. It's a horrible habit.
I started in middle school and... What you got there?
Oh, the little girl from the general store, she drew it for me.
I think it's the store owner's daughter. - Oh.
it's a flying fish, right?
Yeah, that's what she said.
what a beautiful day, huh?
I love how the light comes through the trees.
I always dreamed of going overseas to Europe and learning different languages, meeting new people.Eating my way through Italy.
I've never even made it over the Atlantic.
I'm sure you will. You still have plenty of time.
Yeah.
OK, well. Thanks for the walk.
of course. See ya. - Bye.
detective Tierney, Boston PD. Do you know this woman?
I'm sorry, Detective...
have you seen this woman?
no. Sorry.
Hi. - Hello.
do you know this woman?
no, I don't know this woman. - No?
she's new to the neighborhood. - Is she?
to the beach? I don't think so.
I saw you got to spend some time with Alex and his kids.
Yeah.
I guess by now you heard about what happened to his wife?
it was cancer.
a few years ago. And it nearly broke Alex in half.
this storm's gonna blow over here pretty soon and all the people are gonna be coming in from the beach and we're gonna get really busy.
Katie!
your paint's here.
I had this extra can of primer in the back. I thought maybe you might want to put that down before you put the paint down.
Oh, yeah, right. I didn't even think about that.
let me grab my keys. I'll give you a lift.
no, I'll be... I'm fine. - You're gonna walk - all the way back with the cans? - Yeah.
are you...? - Yep. I'm good.
what you been doing in there?
nothing.
nothing? Look at your hands and look at your mouth.
what is that truck? - I don't know, Aunt.
it's Mark Twain. - Well, I know.
the kids love it.
I can't complain. You know, it could be worse.
it could be Slayer. I got Slayer in here.
why don't we listen to that instead?
no, this is good. - OK.
the switch hovered in the air. The peril was desperate.
all right.
you can just leave it there. - No, I can run it up to...
no, no, no, really, it's fine.
thank you. Just... - OK. I'll just leave it right there.
see ya. - Bye.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, I got some other stuff you might need just in case.
some tape, sandpaper, scrapers, things like that.
just tape around, sand it down before you put the primer... you know what to do.
all right. - Thanks.
Yep.
he surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him.
and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit.
I like this color. It's brightening up the place.
Yeah, I like it.
so, you think you're gonna stay in town for a while?
Yeah, we'll see.
all right, have a good one. - Thank you, Alex.
well, what you got there?
did you leave this outside my house last night?
maybe.
I can't take it.
well, it was just sitting in my shed.
it's OK, I don't have any use for it.
you know what? I just...
I don't appreciate you coming in the middle of the night to my house.
and I know this is a nice gesture, but I just... I can't accept it.
so, um... - I don't understand.
it's not a big deal. It's just a bike. - I know.
I see you walking back and forth... - I didn't ask for it and I don't want it. So...
wait, I'm sorry.
you know, normally when somebody does something nice for you, you just say thank you.
I like the curtains. - I mean...
...I barely know this guy and he comes to my house in the middle of the night, - and just leaves something...? - Oh, Katie... Katie.
look, I know you found a place as far away from people as you could, but you're gonna have to learn that if you're gonna live south of the Mason-Dixon line, people give you stuff.
that means stuff you don't want, stuff you don't even need.
trust me, there is no hidden agenda. - No, because when you put it...
and sometimes we just leave that stuff in the front yard.
I just don't want to owe him anything.
it's a bike, not a kidney.
so, you're saying that I overreacted a little?
Yeah. Yeah, maybe a little bit.
all right, maybe I did overreact. - Thank you.
a little.
look, Katie, the great thing is life is full of second chances.
Hey, Alex.
so... you were right.
I was right? About what?
I should have just said thank you.
for the bike.
I'm sorry, I was really rude and... - No, no, no, it was my fault.
I should have asked you before I did it.
bus is here!
don't worry, it won't happen again.
Hi. - Hi, how are you?
Where's your bathroom? - Uh, straight back there.
Oh, thanks. - Hi, Katie.
Hi. - Can I have some popcorn?
popcorn anywhere? - Popcorn... is right over here.
No! - Josh!
Josh!
I hit my head! - I know, I know!
Alex, is he OK?
get him around to the ladder. - Lexie.
you OK? It's OK, it's OK.
it's OK. - I hit my head!
here we go.
you OK?
just stand back.
how you doing? You OK?
you're OK. You're OK. Come on.
stop. Stop it.
I'm fine.
Katie! - Watch your step.
thank you.
watch your step.
of course.
did you forget something?
you forgot your bike!
Katie!
see? It's not so hard.
Hi, Jo!
Hey, so listen, I've been looking over this Lumpkin case and...
I didn't ask you to do that. Who asked you to do that?
you know what it looks like? It looks like his alibi might actually check out.
OK, right.
lieutenant signed off on it, the DA's office signed off on it.
the case is closed. I've got open cases to work now.
I mean, the guy has three little kids and, you know, even if there's a slight chance he's innocent...
Oh, God, don't you have like a wife or something that you can go home and irritate?
look... no one's innocent.
no one.
I don't care if he killed her himself. He was there. He knows what happened.
I'm not his judge, I'm not his jury... I'm not his maker.
the job is to bring him in, the other guys sort him out.
Alex, the crowds are gonna be huge, we gotta go bigger.
every year the crowds get bigger and every year you call me freaking out that we need to make the show bigger.
I don't know how much bigger we can make it, man.
I am not freaking out.
city council called and said they're expecting 100, 000 people.
now those are big city numbers, so we need to put on a big city show.
I got this new brochure I want you to see.
no, no, no, I've seen the brochure. All right?
no, you haven't seen the new one. But that's not the point. The point is...
daddy, when are we going? - Hold on. In a minute, sweetheart.
Hey, Mulligan, you boys born stupid or you had to work at it?
zip it, Luther.
I'll stop in in the next week. - Great, fine. When?
no, no, no... - Katie!
Hey. - Hey, hold on one second.
what's up? - Can you go to the beach with us?
Lexie. She's not... - I don't know.
we're going to the beach. - Yeah, I see that.
I need her to come right now!
Lexie, she's not coming with us.
I want her to come! - Actually, that sounds really nice.
Really? - Yeah.
what do you say? - Yes!
Alex - OK. All right, OK. - Alex.
I gotta go. You're breaking up. - No, Alex, don't hang up on me.
wait...
he hung up.
look at Roxy. - Roxy.
I think this one's Roxy. Do you like this one?
Yeah. - Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. - Should we do it?
you're a good shopper. - Are you cool with this?
with what? - Katie coming to the beach with us.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
how about you?
it's a little awkward.
line it up.
line it up.
all right, let's get a photo.
look up. Josh, look up.
all right, you two. Come on, let's get a photo.
all right.
all right, let's take a photo here.
one, two
thank you.
OK, one, two, three.
come on, give it back! - No, you're done.
caught one. He caught one! - Oh, my gosh!
what do you got?
Aah! My battery's dead, hold on one second.
I lost my battery power. - Oh, no.
what happened to the fish?
I don't know.
what do you mean, you don't know?
just one time, could I get a picture of you with your fish?
why do you always have to take pictures?
I don't know, Josh, because I want to be able to remember this stuff, that's why.
try to remember without the camera.
what do I do about Josh?
he's testing me.
do you think it's just a phase?
I hope so.
no, I see the way he pushes your buttons.
Josh was young, but he remembers her, you know?
Lexie remembers the idea of her and...
it's just... there's a difference.
you know?
have you talked to him?
at this point, I don't really know what to say to him.
Oh!
you did a good job with this.
so, why Southport?
um... Because it looks like this. Just a clean, empty canvas.
you're starting over.
you know, sort of.
I kinda was just...
looking for a change and...
I always wanted to live in small town, so...
well, you found one.
it is pretty small.
Yeah, a little too sleepy sometimes, if you ask me.
well, the grass is always greener, so... - Yeah, but it's nice. You'll like it.
are you staying or... you just passing through, or what's your story?
so many questions.
just curious.
what about you?
are you from here? - I'm from Wilmington.
we used to come here quite a bit when I was a kid.
stayed for a few weeks, I loved it.
my Uncle Roger, the guy that I work with at the store...
Yeah. - ...worked with him for a few weeks out of the summer...
...then when we got pregnant it just seemed like...
...it seemed like the right place to stay.
mighty Josh is crushing!
No!
one, two, three!
now let's all do Josh's face.
ready? - You ready?
one, two, three.
well, here we are.
thanks for coming. - I had a great time.
it was fun. - Thank you.
all right. - All right.
well, have a good night. - You, too.
Oh, hey, I forgot to ask you, how'd your floors turn out?
you want to see?
all right.
wow, look at that.
I wasn't too sure about the yellow, but it looks pretty good.
Yeah, thank you.
thanks to your primer and Lexie's keen eye...
Yeah. - ...I think it worked out.
looks like your walls need a little...
Jeez! - Oh, my God.
are you OK?
sorry I'm laughing. Are you OK?
what the hell just happened here?
I'm sorry, I should've told you about that. - I just made a giant hole in your floor.
the hole was there. So you're OK. - I can fix this.
I have... - You're OK, right?
I have a hammer and some nails in my truck.
you're fine, you're fine. - It would take me two minutes to...
Alex, it's... - You don't want to leave a giant hole...
OK. Here. - So...
so... - All right.
I'm fine. I promise. - I'm gonna go.
Bye, Josh.
Bye. - I had fun.
that's it?
how about some manners? - He's fine. He's fine.
he's tired.
thank you, again. I had fun.
Hey, anytime.
I think they had more fun with you than me.
drive safe.
Bye.
careful up there.
you know, if you fall, it's not gonna be anybody's fault but your own.
that's enough, honey. You've got enough of those already.
come on in. - Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am.
it's me again.
mind if I come in for a moment?
actually, this is a very bad time.
it's time for my husband's nap. Dan, come on in for your nap.
I understand, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I just needed to ask you a few more questions.
I answered all of your questions about her last time.
I really don't know what you want me to say.
it's just a moment of your time... - You wanna bring some cherries home?
no, dear, he doesn't. No. - No, sir. Thank you.
have a good day.
here's one.
Hey, Katie! Come here and you try.
no, I don't really know what I'm doing, so...
come on, you can do it. - Come on, it's easy.
it's tradition. - OK. All right. What do I do?
you just see a fish and you stab it.
I... I stab a fish. OK, easy. - Yeah.
I'm your eyes. - How do I...?
here's one right here.
get him! - You see it? OK, you just stab it, OK?
OK, OK, I got it, I got it.
Whoo! Oh, shit, I got it!
what's this?
this is a gift.
this is to say thank you. - What...?
did you actually catch this? - I speared it.
you gigged it.
I gigged it? I gigged it. - You gigged it.
Josh, look at this.
she gigged it. - Cool.
that is disgusting. - That is...
but you know what? I can't accept it.
you're gonna have to stop doing nice things for me.
Ah... Well...
...you could just say thank you.
OK, well, thank you, for thank you flounder.
I'm gonna put it in the fridge. - Yeah.
all right.
did Josh leave already?
Yeah, I'll take you to soccer, sweetheart. Go get your backpack.
OK. - Hey, Lexie.
Hi.
what about my snack?
I'll get you some oranges, all right? - OK.
all right, well, you'll have to let me know how the fish is.
Oh, I'm sure it'll be great. We'll probably grill that up tonight.
yeah? Well, good. - Mm-hm.
I don't know how to grill flounder, but I'm sure you do.
Oh, it's pretty simple. - Yeah?
I like to go fishing in my canoe.
you ever go canoeing?
canoeing, you ever been? - Canoeing?
uh... no. - I like canoeing.
where do you go?
Dutchman's Creek.
Dutchman's Creek, lot of gators there. I like Walden Creek better.
just got a new canoe. - Hm.
anyway, there's, uh...
it's not the most exciting thing in the world, but it's beautiful out there.
you know? - Yeah.
Hey, I think I got everything I need here.
spit it out. Get it over with, will you?
you wanna go canoeing with me? - No price tag on it. How much is it?
Yes. Yes, I would.
you would? - Yes.
tomorrow? - That'd be great.
OK.
we should be back around six or seven. There's plenty of food in the fridge.
as you know, the kids won't be shy about telling you what they don't like.
well, it's gonna rain, you know? - What?
it's not gonna rain. I checked the weather report.
it said a five percent chance of rain.
Yeah, well, the weather report's wrong.
they have instruments for this.
Doppler, Super Doppler, all kinds of other crap.
you have an arthritic knee.
it tightens up, it's gonna rain.
don't need a Doppler or Super Doppler... - It's not gonna rain.
to figure that out.
it's so beautiful. - Yeah.
this is probably my favorite place in the whole world.
did you used to, um... come here with your wife?
Yeah.
does it get better? With time?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, at first, I tried to avoid any place that we went together.
I tried to forget, I tried to put it all behind me.
I tried to, you know...just look forward.
but it just didn't work.
and I realized that if...
...if I'm not thinking about her, who is?
you know? And she didn't deserve that.
she was an amazing woman and I loved her and I want my kids to know that.
I want them to know her.
so... I don't know, I just...
we're just keeping our heads down.
getting to play mom and dad which is interesting.
just trying to keep it all together, really.
but today with you, this is probably the first time that I've looked up.
it's a perfect day.
did you feel that?
no.
all right.
it's just a little light shower. It'll pass in a bit.
Yeah, just a little... - Let's go over here.
it's off in the distance. We'll be all right.
did you hear that? - We're all right under here.
you know what?
I have a better idea. You hungry?
Yeah. OK. - OK. All right.
come on.
Oh, my gosh!
come on.
hello. How's it going?
want to just sit here? - Can we seat ourselves?
I have a friend who's coming back from Charlotte.
he should be able to pick us up on his way back through, but he isn't picking up his phone, so...
well, no rush.
I mean, I'm happy here.
so... - Yeah?
Yeah.
it's a big study. That's what this whole book is about.
what I always wondered was gorillas, maybe the strongest animals on the planet.
primates, anyway. - Yeah. Mm-hm.
don't eat meat. - Fruits and vegetables.
they eat mostly kale.
Yes, kale is fantastic for your body.
is there protein in kale or is that just...?
I'm sure there is. - Where does the strength come from?
they have to... it has to be genetic. - It's genetic, but...
except what are you gonna eat? Fruit, vegetables, nuts...
I'm guessing Rhett will be here soon. I should probably settle the...
it sure cleared out.
let me see if I can find someone. - Thank you, by the way.
you're welcome.
Hello?
Hello?
this song is nice.
let's go this way.
what's this?
well, thank you. - Oh, you're welcome.
how's my hat? - Very pretty.
thank you.
step away from the girl!
all right, all right. It's just Rhett.
come on.
come on.
it's just my friend.
we're in for a nasty rainy season.
I don't know what we're gonna do on the Fourth if it keeps going like this.
what does that mean, the fireworks are a wash?
not a chance, buddy-boy. The show goes on.
we've been running the fireworks show here for as long as we can remember.
biggest extravaganza on the Eastern Seaboard.
what? - Yeah.
that's a slight exaggeration. - Oh, I don't think so.
maybe the lower third of North Carolina.
Oh, bullshit. - God.
bullshit. Who does it better than we do? Come on.
that's the answer. Thank you. - Nobody does it better than we do, officer.
nobody. We do it best. - Yep.
end of the line, everybody out.
pretty isolated out here.
I got neighbors. They're not too far.
Oh.
pleasure as always, ma'am.
all right. - OK.
good night. Thank you. - Oh...
come here.
shut up.
thank you. - You got it, buddy.
all right. I'll see you tomorrow. - You bet.
we'll talk fireworks. - Yes, we will.
I guess your arthritis is smarter than the both of us.
dad? Where have you been?
out having fun.
why are they still up?
probably too much candy.
Hey, guys.
where have you been?
I'm sorry I'm late, honey.
I just... I got caught in a rainstorm and I wasn't expecting to be out this late, OK?
but you weren't here to tuck me in.
I know.
but I'm here now. I can tuck you in now.
Yeah. I just missed you a lot.
you did? I missed you, too.
I missed you more.
no way. Not possible.
it is possible.
good night.
dad! What are you doing up there?
it's Mom's place!
I'll be right there. Hold on.
you're not supposed to be up there.
I know. I know.
look, I know that it's Mom's place.
and it's always gonna be her place.
not like you care.
Hey. Hey... Come on, bud, I'm doing the best I can, all right?
it's Mom's place. - I know that it's Mom's place.
thank you for everything.
Oh, kiddo, you're welcome.
just call me when you land somewhere safe, OK?
do you promise? You take this.
be careful.
Hey, it's me.
I know I should have called a long time ago...
...but I just wanted to let you know that...
...I've ended up somewhere safe.
that's your handwriting.
now you lied to me, Mrs. Feldman.
you told me you didn't know her, but that's not the case, is it?
so, open the door, we're gonna have that little talk now.
when you get a warrant, I'll open the door.
well, don't go away, I'll get that warrant.
I'm here for a pick up.
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I just came by to see you because...
I gotta go. All right, quit messing around and get back to work.
see you tonight! - Bye!
we spent hours talking at dinner last night.
I haven't had that much fun in a long time.
hm, to think it all started with a bike.
I thought you said that was him just being Southern.
Ah, yeah, I was lying. He was making a move.
what?
you know, some people just need a little nudge.
I could tell you weren't gonna get there on your own.
Yeah, well, you're lucky it worked out. - Yep.
you want anything? - Oh, no, I'm good.
so, um... I fixed the floor.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
hm.
if you wanna check it out.
Yes.
OK.
OK. - OK.
angel Cake's the fireworks. - Oh.
no, they're elegant, they don't cost as much.
they come in red, white and blue, you're really gonna love these.
I think we should go with these this year. Take a look.
Highway Patrol just faxed these docs for you to sign, boss, if you don't mind.
all right. That's fine. Anyway... Oh, you know what?
we could go with the, uh... What's the other one?
black Cat Aerial Phenomenons or the Whistling Dixies.
the Whistling Dixies. I mean, they really whistle "Dixie." How cool is that?
no, it really is. Where did I leave that?
in the can. - Shit, you're right.
hold on, hold on, hold on.
Alex, let me get this for you.
bass, where did you put it? - In the can.
Rhett, I gotta... I forgot something back at the house.
what? - I'll be back in a minute.
Hey, hey...
I know, I know, I know.
Kevin, can I see you in my office?
Yeah, I'm in the middle of something... - Now!
Oh...
all right, I'll see ya later, Katie. - All right. I'll see you tomorrow, Frankie.
Erin?
what is this, some kind of a joke?
what is this?
I don't know. - You don't know?
special bulletin, person of interest "suspect murder, first degree. Erin Tierney"?
who did you kill? - No, it's not what you think.
why don't you tell me what I'm supposed to think then?
because I see your picture on a wanted sign saying you're a suspect for murder.
your name is Erin.
Erin.
please, Alex, let me explain. - I trusted you.
I let you into our lives, for Godsakes, my kids.
my kids trusted you. What the hell am I supposed to tell my kids?
that I was stupid, I was a stupid young girl that got into a relationship with the wrong man.
how am I supposed to believe that? - Who hurt me.
how am I supposed to believe anything that comes out of your mouth?
I don't even know your first name, for Christ's sake.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
the last thing that I wanted to do is hurt anybody.
you should go. - Especially you.
you should go. You should probably go before Rhett sees that.
what's up, boss?
you tell me.
what's this?
that's... that's not what you think.
tell me what it is.
what's in your water bottle?
your water bottle, you carry it with you everywhere you go. What's in it?
water. - Yeah? Give it to me.
Why?
as of now, you are suspended without pay, pending internal review.
I need you to hand over your badge and your gun.
don't take the badge, boss.
do you have any idea how many rules you've broken?
Hey, Miss Katie!
you know, I knew you were crazy, but I didn't think you were stupid.
I need to find her. - You don't do it like this.
you know that. You know that!
I need your badge and your gun.
I need to find her, Jim.
Kevin, you sent out a nationwide APB.
she's not a murderer for Christ's sake, she's your goddamn wife.
something smells amazing.
Hey, you're home early.
Oh, you're killing me.
how was your day? - Tiring, sweaty, hot, horrible.
lovely. What's this for?
what's it for? I need an excuse to give my wife a gift?
it's beautiful. Thank you. - You like it?
Yeah. It's really gorgeous.
may I? - Of course.
this is the best pie I've ever tasted.
yeah? It's a new recipe.
it's so good. So good.
thank you. Are you done with this?
Yeah.
you think I'm done with that?
no, I was just... coming to pour you some more.
you want to say something, you say it.
I don't have anything to say.
you got that look.
I don't have any look.
what do you want from me?
nothing. I don't want anything.
how many times do you have to hear me say I'm sorry?
you won't let it rest.
every moment of every day you want me to apologize. You make me...
no, it's fine, I promise. It's fine.
I'm just gonna go put on some coffee.
you think you can walk away from me? - No.
huh?
Kevin - Kevin! - What do you want from me, baby?
I give you everything! Everything!
stop, please. Kevin, stop, please!
what do you want from me, huh? - Please. Please, please...
No!
stop! Please.
No!
listen to me. You listen to me.
you know that I love you. - Stop!
I gave you the necklace for a reason, baby! Why did you make me do this?
stop fighting, stop fighting. - Kevin!
I love you so much, and you want to walk away from me?
Katie, what's going on? - I've gotta get out of here.
I've been here for too long.
whoa, what are you talking about? You just got here.
it's exactly what I was afraid of, Jo.
the things I've done... I can't stay.
OK, Katie, let's just calm down, OK? We can figure this out. All right?
wait, does Alex know that you're leaving?
who do you think was the one who told me to go?
Alex wants nothing to do with me anymore.
and frankly, I don't blame him.
look, Katie, if you run now, you're taking the easy way out.
the easy way? You think this is easy for me?
you obviously don't know me.
Katie, you have people here who care about you.
I think that you should stay here and face whatever this is.
face things the way you face things?
excuse me?
come on, Jo. You know you're stuck here and for no good reason.
at least I know when it's time for me to leave.
Yeah, you're right, Katie.
but some of us don't have that choice.
good luck, Katie.
Katie!
excuse me.
excuse me. Katie!
Katie! Hey.
Alex - Alex. - Look...
I can't. - ...I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. Please, just...
...just stay.
no. You were right.
I have to go.
he's gonna find me. He's gonna find us. - Whoa, wait. Just tell me the truth.
just tell me what happened, and if you're in trouble, we can get the police involved. I can talk to Rhett.
you don't understand, Alex, he is the police.
my husband's a cop in Boston. That's why he could do all that.
I don't care, all right? I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.
I'm not gonna let him hurt you anymore.
it doesn't even matter.
I can't put you through that. I can't put your family through that.
he's always gonna be there.
he doesn't quit. - Katie. Listen to me.
I'm in love with you.
I'm in love with you.
and if you stay, I promise...
...there's no safer place in the world than right here with me.
God, I'm so scared.
I know you are, but you don't have to be.
you don't have to be scared.
I love you.
please stay.
saturday, 2: 03 p. m.
Hey, Ma, it's Andy. Give me a call.
sunday, 9: 00 p. m.
Hi, this is Ernie calling from Buffalo...
monday, 11: 47 a. m.
Hey, it's me.
I know I should have called a long time ago...
...but I just wanted to let you know that...
...I've ended up somewhere safe.
Hello, you've reached Ivan's Fish Shack,
Southport's finest waterfront cafe.
we're open Tuesday through Sunday from ten to ten, and we're located at 631 Yacht Basin, just past the Frying Pan.
if you need to leave a message for Maddie, just wait for the beep.
thank y'all.
you just become dark, like there's...
...the life is just sucked out of you.
you just felt worthless, like there's no point.
and I just stuck up for him all the time.
cause it wasn't his fault. It was mine.
and you're completely alone.
it's OK.
it's OK.
you're OK now.
I've never really talked about it.
I'm so glad you're here.
and I am, too.
everything's gonna be OK.
Yeah.
Whoa! - Whoa!
you're gonna help me carry these in?
thank you, buddy. I appreciate it.
listen...
...if there's a problem with her being here, - I want you... - No, it's cool.
seriously. I'm fine.
I like her.
you like her? - Yeah.
well, I like her, too.
I know she likes you.
yeah? - Yeah.
do you need any help?
is that all?
you're a little small to be running a store.
my daddy runs it. I'm just helping. - Yeah?
Where's your daddy? - Not around.
Yeah, what's your name? - Lexie.
Lexie, I'm a policeman. OK?
and I've just driven a very long way to be here today and I would like to speak with someone a little taller.
OK?
Where's your uniform?
my uniform? - Yeah.
I'm a detective. You know what a detective is, Lexie?
no. - No?
well, detectives catch the bad guys. That's what I do.
now, also, I look for missing people.
that's what I'm doing here, Lexie. I'm looking for a missing person.
now...
...have you seen this woman?
no.
you sure? - I'm sure.
you wouldn't lie to a policeman, would you?
no.
OK. OK.
how much is that? - $1. 50.
$1. 50.
two dollars.
thank you. - You keep it.
Bye.
you ready?
Oh! You're getting big!
do policemen always wear uniforms?
uh... I'm sure they take them off when they get home from work.
Hey, guys. - Hey!
happy Fourth. - Look who we have here!
Hey, Lexie! - Go get her!
the Southport High School Marching Band!
the Southport Fire and Rescue!
here comes the Kitty Hawk! First in flight, that's us, North Carolina!
and sponsored by the Daughters of the American Revolution...
the fireworks start at 9: 00, I should be home shortly after that.
all right? - Can I come with you?
you wanna come with? - Yeah, I wanna come with.
OK, yeah. Go grab your shoes. - OK.
Wow.
Hey, and if Lexie's stomach keeps hurting, chamomile tea usually does the trick.
we have some over at the store. - Got it.
all right. You sure you're OK? - We are good.
Alex - You got it? - Alex.
all right, all right. Come on, kid. - Be safe, have fun.
wanna race?
Hey, look who showed up.
Hey, Josh, man. We got plenty of room.
all right, hold on, buddy. Let me get in here first.
all right.
all right! - Put that on.
you ready for a big night? Want to blow some stuff up and be men?
all right, we're gonna do this, boys.
Josh, no drinking, no smoking. You got that?
bow clear.
you're not gonna go climbing around on this thing, are you?
feeling better? - Mm-hm.
all right, here we go! - Ready?
all right, we're hot! - Fire in the hole!
Oh, there's your precious Angel Cake. - What did I tell you, buddy?
angel Cake! - Your precious Angel Cake!
Katie?
Hey.
look, I just want to apologize - for what I said earlier. - He's here.
who's here? - You know who.
you cut your hair.
Kevin. - It looks good.
it looks really good.
thank you.
I found you.
I found you. I missed you, baby.
what are you doing here?
I just want to talk, you know? I just...
I want to talk like we used to talk.
we used to talk about everything, you know?
or nothing, it didn't matter. We just... we just talked.
I miss you so much, baby. - OK, let's talk.
out here. - OK.
what do you want to talk about?
you wanna go home?
I am home.
what? Here?
with him?
huh?
I saw you today.
he doesn't know you like I know you.
he doesn't love you like I love you. - No, he doesn't.
you want me to walk away. Is that it?
Yes. Go.
no, see, you don't tell me what to do.
you hurt me.
I know. - You kept hurting me.
I know. - You need to go right now.
now.
you're making a mistake.
no, I'm not.
you scared me to death, Lex. - But I wanted to see the fireworks.
I know, but we're gonna watch them up here, OK?
I don't wanna.
all right. This is safer.
I need you to stay here for me, OK, Lexie?
OK.
here.
everything's OK. OK? - OK.
I'll be right downstairs.
come on, Alex, come on.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so glad you found me.
take me home. Take me home.
what are you doing?
I want you to take me home.
take me home.
no, Lexie! Lexie!

Lexie! Lexie!
Katie!
Lexie!
dad! - Lexie!
hold on! Hold on!
hold on, Lexie!
baby, I'm here. I'm here.

I gave you everything!
all right. Hold on.
all right, you sit right here, sit right here.
Katie!
No!
Lexie!

I need you to jump. You can do it! Come on.

I saw you.
I'm so sorry, baby.
no. No! No!
Lexie...
Lexie.
are you OK? - Are you OK?
I'm so sorry. - Are you OK?
are you OK? Are you OK? Are you OK?
she's OK, she's OK.
you're OK.
OK.
come on.
Hey, bud. Hey, hey, hey, hey...
it's gone. - I know it's gone.
I know it's gone, but we're gonna rebuild it just like it was before, all right?
I miss her.
I miss Mom.
I miss her, too, buddy.
I'm always gonna miss her.
it's all right. It's OK.
so you're really leaving then, huh?
Yeah. I think that we both know it's... it's time for me to go.
well, when you get a chance, call me.
when you're settled, so I know you're OK.
God... will you look at that sunlight.
it's incandescent today.
Oh, God, it'd make a great photo.
promise me something, Katie. - Yeah.
that you'll take a lot of pictures.
you'll only regret the ones that you didn't take.
thank you.
for being such a good friend.
you deserve this, Katie.
you belong here.
Hi.
so, there's a letter here. It's for you.
Oh, yeah? What is it? - Mm-hm.
I'll be over with the kids.
how's it going?
to the woman my husband loves.
if you're reading this then it must be true.
he loves you. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, or else...
...he wouldn't have given this to you.
I can only hope that you feel the same way about him as he does about you.
but I wanted to write you a letter because I wanted you to know one very, very important thing.
I'm so glad he's found you.
I only wish I could be there...
...somehow... to meet you.
maybe in some ways, I am.
outside of my husband and my two beautiful children...
...you are the most important person in the world to me.
because I'm gone and they're yours now.
Hey, basmati rice. The king of rices.
it's OK. It's OK.
you need to... take care of them.
make them laugh.
hold them when they cry.
stand up for them and...
...teach them wrong from right.
the thought of you... it gives me hope.
hope that Alex remembers what it feels like to be young and in love.
hope that Josh finds somebody to fish with again.
hope that Lexie has somebody there to help her on her wedding day.
I hope that one day my family is whole again.
but most of all, hope that...
...somehow, I'm there with all of you.
watching over all of you.
so you need to get to intelligence?
Yes.
and it's damn critical that I get there as soon as possible.
they've punched through...
all along here...right where we're thinnest.
why would they do that?
if they punch through here, they're exposing their flank.
that's right.
unless, of course, they hurry and make it to the Meuse River and cross over.
I don't get it.
well, if they cross the Meuse, then they can turn and take Leige.
I went through there on my way in.
it's got one of the biggest ammo dumps
I've ever seen there.
it's one of the largest in Europe.
and if the Krauts take Leige, they take the ammo dump.
or we have to destroy it.
either way, it's a straight shot for them to take back Antwerp.
what is this? This ain't German.
thank you.
I have got to get these to there before the Germans cross the Meuse River.
it's over 20 miles.
as a crow flies, yes.
thank you.
and we're supposed to outrun an entire Panzer division, on foot?
you know, we could follow this rail line along here and then cut up through here and shortcut them.
it could save a lot of troops.
hey...
Where'd you learn to speak German?
what?
your German-- where'd you pick it up?
Oh, in Berlin.
what were you doing there?
going to school or something?
no, I was a missionary.
that must have been neat.
hanging out with a bunch of Krauts talking about God.
how is Adolf?
I loved it.
it was the best time of my life.
Hey, Deac.
you wanna see a good magic trick?
I need a smoke.
Hi.
so, Winley...
Where'd you say you were from, exactly?
what is it, Kendrick?
you want one of my fags, is that what it is?
well, uh...
that's...
hmm.
forget I asked.
no problem.
how long has it been since you and Deacon have slept?
Me--two days.
Him--three or four.
the longer he goes without sleep...the more he's gonna lose it.
thank you.
what is he doing?
he's making sure all's clear.
okay, let's go.
move it.
all right, look, we've gone about 12 miles.
we've gotta stop.
we gotta get some shut-eye.
all right?
we're gonna get moving in a hour.
I'm gonna take first watch.
no, I got it, Sarge.
no, you don't.
you gotta get down there and get some sleep.
all right? Go. Move it.
careful.
Hey, Kendrick, that was, uh, nice work really.
Thanks, Sarge.
Yes, thank you for protecting us from the birdies.
very decent of you.
very decent of you.
I fell asleep.
well, you're not the only one.
what about you?
no.
you sure you don't want some coffee?
you sure you don't want some hot lemonade?
what the hell are we doing here, Deac?
this is crazy.
Yeah, you got that right.
I should be home right now.
should be home playing with my nephews, flirting with the girl at my dad's store...
what's her name?
I forgot her name.
and you-- you should be doing...whatever you do.
I should be helping my wife get ready for the baby.
you didn't tell me you were having a baby.
I got the letter on Thursday.
she says she knows it's gonna be a girl.
huh.
she must be due pretty soon then, huh?
Yeah, January 18th.
that's my birthday.
I know.
huh.
hmm.
Thusday--that was the day we hit Essendor.
you'll be all right, Deac.
we just gotta get Winley to Manhay...
win the war, and go home.
Hey, Deac.
I got some lemonade packets.
I'll trade you for a couple of butts.
Kendrick, give it a rest.
nobody has any smokes, especially him.
I just need a smoke.
I gotta figure out where the hell we are.
so, Gould...
what's your secret?
my what?
you know, your big secret you don't tell the other chaps around the campfire.
I mean, we've all got them.
I'm sure Kendrick here has 10 or 20.
Yeah, I don't have one of those.
rubbish.
even if I did...
why would I tell you?
you don't have to tell me, of course.
it's just that we're on this perilous mission together.
and I've found that when man can share anything with each other, anything, well, it creates a certain...
esprit de Corps, you follow?
forget it.
all right, You can play as you want.
I never kissed my wife till the day we were married.
all right, Deacon.
you see, I feel close already.
when I was 15, I showed up at school with a shiner and a bloody lip.
I told the guys I got it plying stick ball, but I actually got it 'cause I got beat up by Alice Palisky.
Alice Palisky. Good.
all right, all right, I got one.
