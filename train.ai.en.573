trust me, if I could do anything to change it,
trust me, if I could find him, I would.
trust me, if I did...
trust me, if I ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator...
trust me, if I ever met a Japan air stewardess who snored like Enid,
trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn't be living here.
trust me, if I had known that his wife was gonna take everything,
trust me, if I had known... That his wife was gonna take everything,
trust me, if I had known

trust me, if anyone wants to find him, it's me.
trust me, if he could see how she looked going out now,
trust me, if he knows anything,
trust me, if he was not my cousin, U would not be standing there.
trust me, if he were in front of me right now, getting arrested would be the least of his worries,
trust me, if it's between archeology and you,
trust me, if there's a second set of shorts at home, you've hit the jackpot.
trust me, if there's anything I know about Danny
trust me, if these seats were any closer,
trust me, if they have him, they won't let anything get in the way of that.
trust me, if this were a mob hit, they'd have hired a man who knew how to shoot.
trust me, if you beasts can bake a two - cheese lasagna, you can beat dirges.
trust me, if you beasts...
trust me, if you do this...
trust me, if you don't pull the trigger, I'll be seeing you again.

trust me, if you had actual proof that this entire investigation was a huge waste of time and resources,
trust me, if you hold on too tight, you'll just drive her away.
trust me, if you want to win your case, you need this information.
trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you'd be laughing.
trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now,
trust me, in about 40 years when those benefits start kicking in,
trust me, in this case, we're the good guys.
trust me, in your case, I was just putting off the inevitable.
trust me, it ain't enough.
trust me, it can get old.
trust me, it could be very helpful to have a girl
trust me, it doesn't. You sure?
trust me, it doesn't.
trust me, it gets old. It's like having a magic golf club:
trust me, it is better just to keep the peace.
trust me, it is better on the one than in one.
trust me, it is better that you are not here this afternoon.
trust me, it is important.
trust me, it is not. No, it's a long story.
trust me, it is not.
trust me, it is off the hook in there.
trust me, it is.
trust me, it just started.
trust me, it might help.
trust me, it never happened.
trust me, it only gets worse.
trust me, it takes a lot more effort to be unhappy.
trust me, it was a steal.
trust me, it was a true accident, all right?
trust me, it was a y you.
trust me, it was actually, it was very funny.
trust me, it was actually, it was very funny.
trust me, it was all you.
trust me, it was an offer too good to refuse.
trust me, it was my sixth birthday,
trust me, it was right here. It disappeared the same day as that...
trust me, it wasa toss - up between you and Virgil, the night janitor.
trust me, it wasn't there till now.
trust me, it will be just how you remember it,
trust me, it will be pretty
trust me, it will not be -
trust me, it will not be...
trust me, it will.
trust me, it won't be long enough
trust me, it won't be one I haven't heard.
trust me, it won't make you happy.
trust me, it won't matter.
trust me, it won't work out well for anybody.
trust me, it won't.
trust me, it works. Bye!
trust me, it works. How do you think I played this one?
trust me, it works. I've done it a half a dozen times.
trust me, it works. I've done it a half a dozen times.
trust me, it would be horrible.
trust me, it would only make you mad.
trust me, it'd be a lot worse if I told her that you had to break into her house.
trust me, it'll be 5 million in 3 months!
trust me, it'll be 5 million in 3 months!
trust me, it'll be better for both of us if you go back in there and tell him you can't take the job.
trust me, it'll be horrible.
trust me, it'll be perfect.
trust me, it'll be worth it, okay?
trust me, it'll glow.
trust me, it'll heal.
trust me, it'll help.
trust me, it'll make everything easier.
trust me, it'll make it much better.
trust me, it'll probably be the highlight of my day.
trust me, it'll take a lot more than roses.
trust me, it's "moot.
trust me, it's a dead end.
trust me, it's a good thing.
trust me, it's a great deed we did here today.
trust me, it's a public service.
trust me, it's agonizing.
trust me, it's all broken in.
trust me, it's all good.
trust me, it's all in her head.
trust me, it's all taken care of.
trust me, it's an honor.
trust me, it's better for you if I don't know anything.
trust me, it's better if she's the one who breaks it off.
trust me, it's better than your firecrackers!
trust me, it's better that way.
trust me, it's better that you stay here.
trust me, it's better this way. Come on, come on.
trust me, it's better this way.
trust me, it's better to be on one than in one.
trust me, it's cool.
trust me, it's done. This is perfect.
trust me, it's done.
trust me, it's even more difficult to avoid me...
trust me, it's far worse when you know the person.
trust me, it's for your own good.
trust me, it's from the devil. It's evil.
trust me, it's getting harder by the second.
trust me, it's going to be a long wait. What, you're a shark expert now?
trust me, it's going to be a long wait.
trust me, it's going to last until she's a bad day.
trust me, it's gonna be fantastic.
trust me, it's gonna be great.
trust me, it's gonna be out of control on that runway.
trust me, it's gonna get worse.
trust me, it's good. Use it.
trust me, it's good.
trust me, it's happening.
trust me, it's happening.
trust me, it's hard to respond...
trust me, it's her.
trust me, it's him.
trust me, it's important.
trust me, it's just around here. It's a shortcut.
trust me, it's just around here.
trust me, it's just like riding a bike.
trust me, it's like buying a car.
trust me, it's messy.
trust me, it's mush.
trust me, it's name that no one's ever going to forget.
trust me, it's no fun.
trust me, it's not a her.
trust me, it's not about me.
trust me, it's not anything you wanna hear about.
trust me, it's not better.
trust me, it's not going to be easy for you.
trust me, it's not like that at all.
trust me, it's not my first rodeo.
trust me, it's not nearly as fun as it sounds.
trust me, it's not something you ever want to experience.
trust me, it's not something you want to do twice.
trust me, it's not that easy.
trust me, it's not that fulfilling.
trust me, it's not what you think it is.
trust me, it's nothing like prison.
trust me, it's nothing personal.
trust me, it's only gonna make things worse.
trust me, it's overrated.
trust me, it's pretty not interesting.
trust me, it's probably better off this way.
trust me, it's really not that funny.
trust me, it's the exact opposite.
trust me, it's the manual override.
trust me, it's the only way you're gonna keep your department in line.
trust me, it's too late.
trust me, it's torture.
trust me, it's up there... Somewhere.
trust me, it's usually not this exciting.
trust me, it's what I do. He's hiding something,
trust me, it's work.
trust me, it's worth it.
trust me, just because a guy makes your heart flutter
trust me, just do it.
trust me, just keep looking.
trust me, kallen, you don't want this kind of kaput.
trust me, kid - you don't want to know.
trust me, kid -
trust me, kid, nobody wants to be that guy.
trust me, kid, when the heat gets hot, they're not gonna give a flying crap about you.
trust me, kid, you dodged a bullet.
trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?
trust me, kid. You don't want to know.
trust me, kid.
trust me, kiddo. You're doing great.
trust me, kids aren't for me.
trust me, kids, you do not wanna be sitting on these benches.
trust me, knife wounds heal.
trust me, lady, I'm not the hugging type,
trust me, leave it!
trust me, let's move out.
trust me, lieutenant, from now on when it comes to Miami,
trust me, lieutenant. In the end, we're all just human.
trust me, life can get the day you take home pretty complicated a big lottery payout.
trust me, life's a lot easier if you learn to tell the truth.
trust me, little Chiyo, you will find her.
trust me, little Chiyo, you will find her
trust me, little girl, this house and everything in it will always belong to me.
trust me, ma 'am, it's my job to smell these things.
