apec conference on enhancing hospital safety and responding to public health emergencies by applying rfid.
apec has an important role to play in that architecture as the leading forum for designing economic policies that promote regional growth and prosperity.
apec has produced a useful travel card that helps business people avoid queues at airports.
apec is already stepping up efforts towards further economic integration, in-cluding lowering trade and investment barriers and improving economic efficiency across the region.
apec is an exercise in "concerted unilateralism," not a strand in the tangled noodle-bowl of bilateral and regional free-trade agreements.
apec is the most influencial economic forum in our region and one of the most dynamic organizations for economic cooperation in the world.
apec leaders said they would examine "options and prospects" for a us-backed proposal to create a pacific-wide free-trade area.
apec should take firmer steps toward the bogor goals on the basis of respect for diversity and, at the same time, help develop the multilateral trading system in line with the principle of "open regionalism."
apec will have to be non-discriminatory and it will have to seek to be open rather than closed in its approach.
apec, as the world's leading growth center, is in a unique position to carry out such a task.
