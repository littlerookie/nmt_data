any idea who sent it?
McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.
in the meantime, who's working on the Gate?
the Gate can wait. This is more important.
with all due respect, sir, I think they're equally important.
wouldn't it make more sense to keep Zelenka working on this mystery object and move McKay back to his gate diagnostics?
it's already been over a week now.
major.
not being able to use the Gate is an inconvenience.
the possibility that someone may have pinpointed our location is a threat.
the threat gets priority.
Yes, sir.
this is pointless.
even though the object survived re-entry physically intact, its internal systems are shot.
these are just incomprehensible readings.
by design.
there's no design here, Rodney. Just meaningless data.
but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking program to fool us.
they're good, I'm better.
who's "they," Rodney?
just do me a favor.
relaunch your decryp sweep.
humor me.
fine.
you realize we don't have to stand around here waiting for the results. It could take hours.
why don't we go back to the Gate?
hang on!
it's working. I'm getting something.
don't touch anything!
whoa, whoa, what happened?
what did you do?
nothing.
I told you not to touch anything! - I didn't touch anything.
the diagnostic program must've crashed.
we lost all the data.
what did you see, Rodney?
nanite code.
it's the Replicators.
sync: YTET- LQBN - =www. ydy. com/bbs=
this Mortal Coil
it's the Replicators. They've found us.
are you sure?
that drone we recovered contained nanites.
you cannot be certain of that, Rodney.
the program went down before we had a chance to retrieve any significant data.
I know what I saw.
it was nanite code.
a split second before the system crashed - I saw nothing.
that's because you weren't looking.
our laptops were receiving the same data stream, Rodney.
if there had been anything, I would have seen it.
well, obviously, you didn't, otherwise...
another one?
Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne here.
go ahead, Major.
there's been an explosion in Dr. McKay's lab.
I suggest you get down here.
what the...
what happened?
well, either your sandwich exploded, or that mystery drone had a built-in self-destruct protocol.
we must have inadvertently initiated it when we ran our analysis.
sorry, Doc.
at least you weren't around when it went off.
lucky us.
something's not right.
that diagnostic program should never have crashed.
it was perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming from the probe.
and then before I get a chance to get it up and running again, what happened?
the probe gets destroyed.
what are you talking about?
I don't know... it just feels like someone or something is working very hard to get in my way.
and, yes, I know what that sounds like.
do me a favor, keep an eye open, okay?
you think he's imagining it?
maybe he needs a vacation.
I guess you disagree, huh?
I don't know. It just seems like people are acting different lately.
different?
I don't know how to explain it.
they just...
haven't been themselves.
Teyla's noticed it, too.
well, maybe everyone's getting a little stir-crazy, not being able to go off-world - you know, acting a little weird, - getting a little paranoid. - I'm not paranoid.
people have been acting weird lately.
you make a compelling argument.
you're going to need stitches.
here.
sorry.
what happened?
ronon decided to knock some sense into me.
let me take a look.
you're fine.
no stitches?
no. Not even a band-aid.
there's nothing there.
I was bleeding.
well, not from any head wound.
it was probably Ronon's blood.
no.
he hit me. I was bleeding.
run a scan on me.
a scan?
if McKay is right and there were nanites in that probe, there's a good chance I got infected.
okay. Hold still.
no nanites.
you're clean.
run a blood test.
John, if you were infected with nanites.
forget the nanites.
something like this happened to me before.
I got infected with the retrovirus and I was able to heal right away.
I'm sure that's not the case now, since you haven't been exposed
maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.
I seriously doubt - just run a blood test!
okay.
I thought the problem was dealt with.
I destroyed the drone.
and made them suspicious in the process.
so what do you suggest we do?
they're still a long way from knowing the truth.
for now, we just need to be careful.
Colonel!
I got your test results back.
I'm pleased to tell you you're 100% bug free.
no sign of the retrovirus in your system.
what's the matter? I thought you'd be happy.
all that says is my blood's clean. It doesn't explain the magical head wound.
maybe it doesn't make sense, because you're refusing to consider the only possible explanation for what happened:
you made a mistake.
ronon wasn't bleeding.
I checked.
well, maybe the blood was already on the towel and you mistakenly transferred it to your forehead.
ronon saw the cut.
he was the one who said I needed stitches.
unless he was wrong, too?
all right. I'll run your blood work again.
if I still can't find anything, we'll do a complete physical.
Hey. - Hey.
What're you all doing here? What's going on?
uh... I'll be right back. I just remembered that I forgot to unplug something, or plug it in.
What're you doing?
this may hurt a little.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
what is the matter with you?
here.
I'll need more than that - disinfectant, some stitches - shut up and hold on a second.
all right.
let's take a look.
it's gone.
that's impossible. How can it-- - that's the reaction we were hoping for.
if it's any consolation, I can assure you that we all underwent the same test.
test? What the hell is going on here?
that's what we'd like to find out.
Rodney, you're not the only one who has noticed the strange behavior of many people on this base.
they've been acting unusually withdrawn, even secretive.
Yeah.
I wasn't sure what to make of it.
at first, I was ready to dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just gross incompetence, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought it didn't make sense, even for him.
it was no accident.
he crashed that diagnostic system on purpose.
I'm assuming what happened with that drone is no accident either.
but what does any of this have to do with my super-healing abilities?
last night, Ronon clubbed me in the head.
by accident.
sort of.
I was cut.
I went to the infirmary to have Keller check it out.
by the time I got there, it was completely healed.
the last time that happened, it was the... it was the retrovirus.
I had her run a blood test.
And? She didn't find anything.
you think she's lying?
I don't know, but we've got to find out.
I can access the infirmary's database from here.
just... do.
okay, I'm in.
now... and...
what?
there's no record of any blood test.
if she did one, she didn't enter the results.
she did a full body scan, too.
there's nothing here.
that's impossible.
the scanner is wired directly into the computer. Results are recorded automatically.
doesn't mean they can't be erased.
all right, we need to run our own tests.
and until we figure out what's going on, we can't risk trusting anyone outside this room.
we have to get into the infirmary without anyone knowing.
I have an idea.
how's it going, Rodney?
I've patched into the lifesigns detector, but there's a problem.
what problem?
just - I'm not sure. Just hold on a minute.
looks like it's working fine to me.
right. Thank you for your input.
is the infirmary clear?
hold on.
this is bizarre. I mean, I can't get it to give me a live feed.
it's like it's stuck on a loop.
well, fix it.
all right, I got it.
what the hell...
now you broke it.
I didn't break it. It's working fine.
is the infirmary clear or not?
the infirmary, the corridors, the surrounding towers.
I mean, according to this, we're the only people on the base.
how is that possible?
off hand, I would say it's not, but right now, I am reading four lifesigns.
let's keep moving.
we have a problem.
let's make this quick.
I've got something.
it's another life-sign.
it's the outer edge of the city.
let's check it out. Come on.
maybe we should...
come on!
what the hell.
nanites.
there's supposed to be a room here.
there is a room here.
easy, easy.
how did you get here?
I don't know.
I can answer that.
this is where we made her.
this is where we made you all.
this explains why we can heal so rapidly.
we get injured, and the nanites effect repairs.
we'd better tell the others.
that won't be necessary.
what the hell is going on?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
you're going to have to come with us.
I don't think so.
that won't do you any good.
I'm warning you, major. Stand down.
go ahead. Shoot.
you see?
you're Replicators?
that's right.
until you began making changes to our base code, we were forbidden from assuming the form of any living human, but now we can take any form we like.
you couldn't replace everyone on the base - Impossible.
only because you believe this is the real Atlantis, and that you're the real Dr. McKay.
so you're saying that we are also Replicators?
no.
you are flesh and blood.
ordinary humans in every way, except that you were manufactured, from the inside out, by nanites, some of which remain in your system, effecting repairs as necessary.
I'm not buying it.
all that you are, your thoughts, your memories, everything was taken from the real John Sheppard and his team when their minds were probed over a year ago.
see, now I know you're lying, because a year ago, Carson Beckett was our chief of medicine.
Dr. Keller hadn't even arrived yet.
this scenario was updated with information obtained from the last member of your expedition to be captured by the Replicators.
you sure about this?
Yeah.
I need to see for myself.
Oh, my god.
all right, we're all infected by nanites.
not infected with. Constructed by.
I don't believe it.
I'm having a hard time with it myself, but it would explain a couple of things.
such as? - Such as why the Gate's not working, for one.
look, if none of this is real, if this is all just a lab rat experiment, then it stands to reason the Gate's not real either.
if this is not the real atlantis, Rodney, you of all people would have noticed.
the stars alone would have - the whole time the Gate's been down, it's been solid overcast.
that's over a week now. Think about it.
when was the last time any of you saw stars?
Dr. Weir.
that's what you named me.
there's no point in calling you anything else.
you're exactly like her in every way.
except that I'm not her.
no.
the real Elizabeth Weir was killed several months ago.
part of her brain had been replaced by nanites.
it was done to save her life, but it made her dangerous.
whenever she linked with other Replicators, the human part of her exerted an unhealthy influence.
at least that's the way Oberoth saw it.
but you don't agree.
why do you think we did all this?
your humanity is what we're interested in.
because the ancients created us with one fatal flaw...
you can't ascend.
that's what you're after, isn't it?
all right, I know this is a lot for everyone to deal with, but we're just going to have to suck it up and refocus.
refocus on what?
getting the hell out of here.
so we can go where? Back to atlantis to resume our lives?
Oh, yeah, I forgot. They're not ours. - Says them.
look, there's no point in denying the facts.
they're telling the truth. We're not who we thought we were.
I may not be the original, but you're going to have a hard time convincing me that I'm not pretty damn close.
our origins do not make us any less human.
not physically, and certainly not mentally, not while we can think for ourselves.
in my heart, there is no doubt. We must return to atlantis.
okay.
we go back, take things from there.
great.
we're all in agreement. We're getting out of here. Now, all we have to do is figure out how.
you're part of Niam's group.
most were reprogrammed, but some of us managed to stay hidden within the collective.
and you think by studying us, you'll discover the secret ingredient?
you are all fully human.
you have the same minds as your original selves, the same thoughts, the same emotions.
more importantly, you have something that's always eluded us, something that kept your kind apart from the very beginning, and made you special in the eyes of our creators.
you would call it a soul.
it is that secret ingredient you referred to, the key to ascension.
that is not something you can learn to acquire simply by studying us.
why not?
a human brain is just an electro-chemical machine.
biologically created, but a machine nonetheless.
everything is quantifiable.
now you sound like Oberoth.
the others have given up on ascension.
they're destroying human populations throughout the galaxy as a tactic in their war with the Wraith.
they're consumed with hatred and revenge.
we believe there's another path.
why are you telling me all this?
you're open-minded, and it's important that we gauge your reactions.
Why?
so we can avoid the same mistakes next time.
they're going to wipe our memories and then start again on another planet.
that probe was sent by Oberoth and the other replicators.
our friends out there tried to destroy it, but they only managed to disable it.
if that thing hadn't crashed into the city, who knows how long this could've gone on.
the point is, this position's been compromised.
once the other replicators find the city, they'll destroy it.
Oh, yeah, us too.
is that any worse than having our memories erased and starting this whole process again?
we've got to find a way out of here.
I'm sorry it's come to this.
listen to me.
you've probed our minds, you know everything there is to know about us, so you should know we will never accept this.
no matter how many times you wipe our memories, we'll always figure it out.
she's right. We're genetically predisposed to being stubborn and really pesky.
you want to understand what it means to be human, right?
you want to know what qualities might eventually lead to ascension.
you can start with compassion.
I understand what you're saying.
and under different circumstances, I might even agree with you.
unfortunately, it's too late.
what are you talking about?
the other replicators have found us.
they failed to break down our mental defenses and bring us back into the collective, so now they want to destroy us.
well, you have to raise the shield.
we can't.
your creation required too much power and we couldn't get our hands on multiple ZPMs without drawing too much attention.
let us out.
your fellow Replicators are targeting human worlds.
they are murdering thousands of innocent people.
if you're serious about following in the footsteps of your creators, you will let us go so we can stop this.
Oberoth is too powerful.
if this city falls and we're destroyed with it, this will be nothing more than a wasted opportunity, a failed experiment.
you know what that feels like.
that's what the ancients considered us...
failed experimen.
well, now's your chance to prove them wrong.
all we're asking is that you give us a chance to make a difference.
take this.
what's this?
it's the core drive of a ship's tracking system.
with this, you should be able to pinpoin the locations and movements of every one of Oberoth's aurora class vessels in this galaxy.
take this to atlantis. It will be their best chance at stopping Oberoth.
go up to the bay. Take a jumper.
come with us!
I can't.
Oberoth might be able to track me.
I'll only be a liability.
go.
that's it.
the city's gone.
so now what?
we're already cloaked.
all we need to do is follow the ship out of the atmosphere then catch a ride before it jumps into hyperspace.
catch a ride?
Yeah.
watch.
okay, redeploying drive pods.
nice and snug.
you doing okay?
sure, all things considered.
not bad for a dead woman.
everything'll be fine.
my guess is we're headed back to the Replicator home world.
once we get there, we can find a ship with a hyperdrive.
and go where?
well, obviously, we can't fly straight back to atlantis.
they'd probably take us out before we had a chance to explain, but maybe New Athos.
we can contact them once we get there.
and then what?
how do you think the real Sheppard is going to react when he sees you?
how would you react?
in a way, I'm lucky.
at least I know I'm the only Elizabeth Weir out there.
you were right.
it's the Replicator home world.
looks like they've been busy.
what do you mean?
remember those shipyards we destroyed?
that's one of them.
they rebuilt it.
and then some.
good.
then we should be able to find a ship they won't miss.
it's a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency.
look, the gate will be offline for what, one, two hours tops
we expecting someone? - No, sir.
but it's major Jordan reporting in from M34 227.
do we have video? - Yes, sir.
what's the situation, Major?
well, sir - there's someone here who'd like to have a word with you.
Hello, John.
what happened to you? How'd you get away?
I'm not Elizabeth.
well, not the Elizabeth you knew.
I have all of her memories, and all of her thoughts, everything that makes her me.
but I'm a Replicator.
I was created by a faction of the replicators as a means to attaining ascension.
you look and sound just like her.
I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true.
this group managed to isolate themselves from the others in order to pursue their study in secrecy, but they were eventually discovered and destroyed.
I don't know what to say. This is all very...
strange?
Yeah, I know.
but we need to meet.
we have some information that you can use against the Replicators.
we?
I suppose introductions aren't really necessary.
great.
the last time I came face to face with myself, I ended up kicking my own ass.
nice jacket.
uh, yeah. It's new.
we got new versions of those uniforms.
the old ones used to, uh...
bunch up under the arms...
you said you've got something for us?
Yeah.
my McKay.
Oh. Yeah. Right.
what is that?
this is the core drive of a replicator ship tracking system.
once it is up and running, we'll be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the pegasus galaxy.
it's not much, but it's a start.
are you kidding? This is huge.
we've got to get to work on - [Together]: A modification program.
reconfigure the base sequencing - and run it through one of the ancient relays so that.
it's automatically adapted and outputted.
Outputted?
is that even a word?
of course it is. We can't both be wrong.
we've got to get started on this now.
whoa, whoa. Not so fast.
where are you planning to do this?
we're too big of a security risk to be allowed back on Atlantis.
he's got a...
I've got a point.
you two are going to have to find another way to do that.
I'll just go back to Atlantis, and get what we need, we can do all the work right here.
this is great.
finally, someone in whom I can have 100% confidence.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
and this is just the beginning.
humanity's about to benefit from one of the greatest living scientific minds.
times two!
can you imagine? - I'm trying not to.
we appreciate all this, but the truth is, we came here for another reason.
you were with the Replicators.
what do you know about our Elizabeth?
and are you willing to help us get her back?
you think the other Keller was telling the truth?
I don't know why she would lie.
it's kind of weird, that's all.
I mean,
I don't see you for all this time, and then five minutes later, I find out...
that I'm dead.
Yeah.
don't worry. The moment I learned the truth,
I knew there'd be no going back to the way things were. Not for me.
not for any of us.
I don't like it.
Yeah. It's odd.
I know I'm me, so who the hell's this other guy?
he is you as well.
no, there's only one me.
apparently not.
he's nothing but a copy, then.
from what I understand, even though he is not the original, he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.
I don't like it.
I didn't really believe it. Not until we got here.
I was holding out hope as well.
I thought that the replicators had captured us and implanted the nanites, and that they were lying to us to keep us from wanting to return.
well, it worked.
I'm not going back with them.
Ronon... - what?
I've been on my own before.
at least, that's how I remember it.
and now I've got these nanites that'll heal me if I get injured.
you are not invincible. The nanites can only do so much.
I'll take my chances.
I understand your anger and your disappointment, but it makes no difference who came first.
you are as much ronon as he is.
Oh, yeah?
then why does he get to live my life on Atlantis while I'm treated like an outsider?
our circumstances are different.
you mean we make them feel uncomfortable, so they'd rather not have us around.
given our origins, they see us as a potential threat.
can you blame them?
I guess not.
I'd probably do the same.
still, that doesn't change
we'll go back to the camp.
we'll go find Sheppard and Weir.
it's not like this hasn't happened before.
the other Elizabeth got infected by those little nanite things, and we figured out how to stop them.
maybe we can do the same for you.
so we wouldn't be a security threat.
you can contribute.
things'll just be different.
that's not really the issue, John.
I guess what really bothers me is just knowing that you and the others will always consider me less than what I really am.
that's not true. - Of course it is.
and I don't blame you.
do you hear something?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla! Please respond.
go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?
it's the Replicators! They're here!
they managed to track the ship.
John, do you hear me? - Oh, yeah, I heard you.
out ship must be hidden some ubspace transponder.
all right. Run!
what was that?
that way! Come on!
Ronon! Wait!
Where's McKay? - He's still at the compound.
Rodney, this is Sheppard! I need you to fall back to the gate immediately!
Colonel, this is Major Jordan. The Gate is a no go.
I repeat - the Gate is a no go.
there's a Replicator ship in position ready to take us out the second we show ourselves.
all right. Everybody, fall back to the jumper. Rodney, did you hear me?
Yeah. I heard you. We're on our way.
John, they're guarding the Gate.
they have us trapped.
even cloaked, if the jumper so much as rustles a bush, they will pinpoint our position and blast us out of the sky.
we need a diversion.
what's happened? - It's the Replicators. Let's go.
we'll all have a better chance this way.
I don't want you doing this because you feel any less...
human?
from the beginning, we've been trying to convince ourselves that we're just like you.
now we've got a chance to prove it.
all right.
let's go.
Yeah, we tricked you...
but don't feel so bad.
after all, we almost had ourselves convinced.
shut it down!
no one else is coming.
shall we take a break?
you go ahead.
Rodney, you've been working for five hours straight.
you should take a break. - I will. When I'm finished.
I know what you're trying to do.
and what's that?
lose yourself in your work to avoid thinking about Elizabeth.
you must realize it's only a temporary distraction.
that's one of the perks of the job.
if something terrible happens, you don't have time to dwell on it because you're too busy trying to keep the next terrible thing from happening.
seriously, if it wasn't for the Replicators and their plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy,
I'd be in pretty bad shape right now.
this is Carson all over again, and I'm just not ready to deal.
not yet.
you're not the only one who misses them, Rodney.
I don't suppose you want to talk about it?
eventually. But not now.
okay.
shall I get you anything? - No.
thank you.
you're welcome, Rodney.
how's it going?
it's all right.
why don't you call it a night?
no. I... I want to finish this.
what about you? Isn't it past your bedtime?
I'm going to approve the removal of her personal items tomorrow, have everything shipped back to earth.
I would have done it sooner, but I actually thought we were going to bring her back.
Yeah.
me too.
let me know when you get this thing working.
will do.
Oh, wait!
if this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.
that's not so bad.
I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.
on the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.
a lot more.
Oh, crap.
initiating secondary diagnostics... now.
no variances. - Are you sure?
Yeah, positive. - Well, check again.
Rodney, there's nothing here. - Okay, just get over here, and...
monitor power readings.
no variances.
you catching any discrepancies on your end?
nothing. - You sure?
Rodney! - Okay, just go back, go back...
all right, do we know what the problem is?
Yeah. The Gate's not working.
I think we figured that much last week when you broke it?
I did not break the Gate.
it just stopped working around the same time you were screwing around with it.
I wasn't screwing around with it! I was running a program to boost its operating efficiency.
Yeah, well, good job.
it had nothing to do with why the Gate malfunctioned!
we've been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my program,
I feel confident we're making some progress, and that things will be up and running in...
what was that?
an unidentified object just struck the City.
why didn't the sensors pick it up? - I don't know, it came in so fast.
we're getting a low-level energy signature.
what could it be? - Let's find out.
any injuries? - No, Sir.
thank God it hit the reading library or somebody really could have gotten hurt.
what is it?
it's obviously some kind of mobile self-contained unit a drone, possibly a probe. It's definitely not wraith design.
perhaps it's Lantean, you know? A de-orbited satellite or a device on a recall directive.
maybe. It's still emanating a trace energy field.
is it dangerous? - No, it's just interesting.
check that out.
it was damaged on re-entry. So what?
re-entry wouldn't have caused that.
looks like weapons fire. Maybe it took a hit before it came down.
and yet it came out in one piece.
tough little bastard!
Colonel. Do we know what it is yet?
looks like a probe of some kind.
any idea who sent it? - McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.
in the meantime, who's working on the Gate?
the Gate can wait. This is more important.
with all due respect, sir, I think they're equally important.
wouldn't it make more sense to keep Zelenka working on this mystery object and move McKay back to his Gate diagnostics?
it's already been over a week now.
major
not being able to use the Gate is an inconvenience.
the possibility that someone may have pinpointed our location is a threat.
the threat gets the priority.
Yes, Sir.
this is pointless.
even though the object survived re-entry physically intact, its internal systems are shot.
these are just incomprehensible readings.
by design.
there's no design here, Rodney, just meaningless data.
but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking program, to fool us.
they're good, I'm better. - Who's "they," Rodney?
just...
do me a favour. Re-launch your decryp sweep.
humour me.
fine.
we don't have to stand waiting for the results. Could take hours.
why don't we go back to the Gate? - Hang on.
it's working. I'm getting something.
Hey, don't touch anything!
what happened? What did you do? - Nothing!
told you not to touch anything! - I didn't!
the program must have crashed. - You lost all the data!
what did you see, Rodney? - Nanite code.
it's the Replicators.
this Mortal Coil
it's the Replicators. They've found us.
are you sure?
the drone we recovered contained nanites.
you cannot be certain of that.
the program went down before we had a chance to retrieve any significant data.
I know what I saw.
it was nanite code a split second before the system crashed.
I saw nothing. - You weren't looking.
our laptops were retrieving the same data stream.
if there had been anything, I'd have seen it.
obviously you didn't, otherwise we would not be having this dis...
another one!
Colonel Sheppard. Major Lorne here. - Go ahead, Major.
there's been an explosion in Dr. McKay's lab. I suggest you get down here.
what the...
what happened?
either your sandwich exploded or that mystery drone had a built-in self-destruct protocol.
we must have inadvertently initiated it when we ran our analysis.
sorry, Doc.
at least you weren't around when it went off.
lucky us!
something's not right.
that diagnostic program should never have crashed.
it's perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming from the probe.
then before we get a chance to get it up and running again, what happens?
the probe gets destroyed.
what are you talking about? - I don't know. I just it feels like someone or something is working very hard to get in my way.
and yes, I know what that sounds like. Just do me a favour: keep an eye out, OK?
think he's imagining it?
maybe he needs a vacation.
I guess you disagree, huh?
I don't know. Just seems like people are acting different lately.
different? - I don't know how to explain it.
they just haven't been themselves.
Teyla's noticed it too.
well, maybe everyone's getting a little stir crazy not being able to get offworld. You know, acting a little - weird, getting a little paranoid. - I'm not paranoid.
people have been acting weird lately.
you make a compelling argument!
I think you're gonna need stitches.
here.
sorry.
what happened?
well, Ronon decided to knock some sense into me.
well, let me take a look.
you're fine.
no stitches?
no. Not even a Band-Aid.
there's nothing there.
well, I'm bleeding.
well, not from any head wound. It was probably Ronon's blood.
no.
he hit me. I was bleeding.
run a scan on me.
a scan? - If McKay's right and there are nanites in that probe, there's a good chance I got infected.
OK.
hold still.
no nanites.
you're clean.
run a blood test. - John, - if you were infected with nanites... - Forget the nanites.
something like this happened to me before. I got infected with a retrovirus - and I was able to heal right away. - I'm sure that's not the case now, - since you haven't been exposed... - Maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.
I seriously doubt... - Just run a blood test.
okay.
I thought the problem was dealt with. I destroyed the drone.
you made them suspicious in the process.
so what do you suggest we do?
they're still a long way from knowing the truth.
for now, we just need to be careful.
Colonel. I got your test results back.
I'm pleased to tell you you're one hundred percent bug-free.
no sign of the retrovirus in your system.
what's the matter? I thought you'd be happy.
all that says is my blood's clean. Doesn't explain the magical head wound.
maybe it doesn't make sense because you're refusing to consider the only possible explanation for what happened.
you made a mistake.
ronon wasn't bleeding. I checked.
well, maybe the blood was already on the towel and you mistakenly transferred it to your forehead.
ronon saw the cut.
he was the one who said I needed stitches.
unless he was wrong too.
all right. Well, I'll run your blood work again and if I still can't find anything, we'll do a complete physical.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you all doing here?
what's going on?
I'll be right back. I just remembered I forgot to unplug something, or plug...
wait, wait. What are you doing? - This may hurt a little.
What?! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
what is the matter with you? - Here.
I'm gonna need more than that, disinfectant and some stitches...
shut up and hold on a second.
all right.
let's take a look.
it's gone!
that's impossible! How could it...
that's the reaction we were hoping for.
if it's any consolation, I can assure you we all underwent the same test.
test? What test? What the hell's going on here?
that's what we'd like to find out.
Rodney, you're not the only one who's noticed the strange behaviour of many of the people on this base.
they've been acting unusually withdrawn, even secretive.
Yeah.
I wasn't sure what to make of it.
at first, I was ready to dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just gross incompetence, but I thought it didn't make sense, even for him.
no, no, that was no accident.
I mean, he crashed that diagnostic system on purpose.
I'm assuming what happened with that drone was no accident either.
what does this have to do with my super-healing abilities?
last night Ronon clubbed me in the head.
by accident...
sort of. - I was cut.
I went to the Infirmary to have Keller check it out by the time I got there it was completely healed.
but the last time that happened, it was the, it was the retrovirus.
that's what I thought, so I had her run a blood test.
And? - She says she didn't find anything.
what, you think she's lying? - I don't know, but we gotta find out.
well, I can access the Infirmary's database from here. Just...
OK, I'm in.
now...
and...
what?
there's no record of any blood test. If she did, she didn't enter the results.
she did a full body scan too.
well, there's nothing here. - That's impossible.
the scanner is wired directly into the computer.
results are recorded automatically. - It doesn't mean they can't be erased.
all right. We need to run our own tests.
until we figure out what's going on, we can't risk trusting anyone outside this room.
we have to get to the infirmary without anyone knowing.
I have an idea.
how's it goin', Rodney?
I've patched into the life signs detector, but there's a problem.
what problem?
just... I'm not sure. Just hold on a minute.
looks like it's working fine to me. - Right! Thank you for your input.
is the infirmary clear?
hold on.
this is bizarre. I can't get it to give me a live feed. It's like it's stuck in a loop.
well, fix it!
all right, I got it.
what the hell?!
Oh, now you broke it.
I didn't break it! It's working fine!
is the infirmary clear or not?
Yeah, the infirmary, the corridors, the surrounding towers.
according to this, we're the only people on the base!
how's that possible? - Off-hand, I would say it's not, but right now I am reading four life signs.
let's keep moving.
we have a problem.
all right. Let's make this quick.
I've got something.
it's another life sign. It's the outer edge of the City.
let's check it out. Come on.
maybe we should...
come on!
what the hell?
nanites!
there's supposed to be a room here.
there is a room here.
wait.
easy, easy.
how did you get here?
I don't know. - I can answer that.
this is where we made her.
this is where we made you all.
this explains why we can heal so rapidly.
we get injured and the nanites effect repairs.
we'd better tell the others. - Yes.
that won't be necessary.
what the hell's going on?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
you're gonna have to come with us.
I don't think so.
that won't do you any good.
I'm warning you, Major. Stand down.
go ahead. Shoot.
you see?
you're Replicators.
that's right.
until you began making changes to our base code, we were forbidden from assuming the form of any living human, but now we can take any form we like.
you couldn't have replaced everyone on the base. It's impossible!
only because you believe this is the real Atlantis, and that you're the real Doctor McKay.
so you're saying that we're also Replicators?
no.
you are flesh and blood ordinary humans in every way except that you were manufactured from the inside out by nanites, some of which remain in your system, effecting repairs as necessary.
I'm not buying it.
all that you are your thoughts, your memories everything was taken from the real John Sheppard and his team when their minds were probed over a year ago.
see, now I know you're lying, because a year ago Carson Beckett was our Chief of Medicine, not Dr. Keller.
she hadn't even arrived yet.
this scenario was updated with information obtained from the last member of your expedition to be captured by the Replicators.
you sure about this?
I need to see for myself.
Oh my God.
all right. We're all infected by nanites.
not infected with, constructed by.
I don't believe it. - I know it's tough to swallow.
I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around it myself, but - it would explain a couple of things. - Such as?
such as why the Gate's not working, for one.
if none of this is real, if this is all just a lab rat experiment, then it stands to reason the Gate's not real either.
if this is not the real Atlantis, you of all people would have noticed. The stars alone...
the whole time the Gate's been down, it has been solid overcast.
that's over a week now. Think about it:
when was the last time any of you saw stars?
doctor Weir.
that's what you named me.
there's no point in calling you anything else.
you're exactly like her in every way.
except that I'm not her.
no.
the real Elizabeth Weir was killed several months ago.
part of her brain had been replaced by nanites.
it was done to save her life but it made her dangerous.
whenever she linked with other Replicators, the human part of her exerted an unhealthy influence at least, that's the way Oberoth saw it.
but you don't agree?
why do you think we did all this?
your humanity is what we're interested in.
because the Ancients created us with one fatal flaw.
you can't ascend.
that's what you're after, isn't it?
all right, I know this is a lot for everyone to deal with, but we're just gonna have to...
suck it up and - re-focus. - Re-focus on what?
getting the hell out of here. - So we can go where?
back to Atlantis to resume our lives? Yeah, I forgot, they're not ours.
says them. - There's no point in denying the facts.
they were telling the truth. We're not who we thought we were.
well, I may not be the original, but you're gonna have a hard time convincing me that I'm not pretty damned close.
our origins do not make us any less human, not physically and certainly not mentally.
not while we can think for ourselves.
and in my heart there is no doubt, we must return to Atlantis.
OK.
we'll go back, take things from there.
great!
we're all in agreement, we're gettin' out of here.
now, all we have to do is figure out how!
you're part of Niam's group.
most were reprogrammed, but some of us managed to stay hidden within the collective.
you think by studying us, you'll discover the secret ingredient?
you're all fully human.
you have the same minds as your original selves, the same thoughts, the same emotions.
more importantly, you have something that's always eluded us, something that kept your kind apart from the very beginning and made you special in the eyes of our creators.
you would call it a soul.
it is that "secret ingredient" you referred to, the key to ascension.
that is not something you can learn to acquire simply by studying us.
why not?
the human brain is just an electro-chemical machine, biologically created, but a machine nonetheless.
everything is quantifiable.
now you sound like Oberoth.
the others have given up on ascension.
they're destroying human populations throughout the galaxy as a tactic in their war with the Wraith.
they're consumed with hatred and revenge.
we believe there is another path.
why are you telling me all this?
you're open-minded, and it's important that we gauge your reactions.
Why?
so we can avoid the same mistakes next time.
they're gonna wipe our memories and then start again on another planet.
that probe was sent by Oberoth and the other Replicators.
our friends tried to destroy it, - but they only managed to disable it. - If it hadn't crashed into the City, - who knows how long it'd have gone on? - Yeah, but the point is, this position's been compromised.
once the other Replicators find this city, they'll destroy it.
Oh, yeah, and us too.
is that any worse than having our memories erased and starting this whole process again?
we've gotta find a way out of here.
I'm sorry it's come to this.
listen to me.
you have probed our minds.
you know everything there is to know about us.
you should know, we will never accept this.
no matter how many times you wipe our memories, we'll always figure it out.
she's right. We're genetically pre-disposed to being...
stubborn, really pesky.
you want to understand what it means to be human, right?
you wanna know what qualities might eventually lead to ascension?
you can start with compassion.
I understand what you're saying, and under different circumstances I might even agree with you.
unfortunately, it's too late.
what are you talking about?
the other Replicators have found us.
they failed to break down our mental defences and bring us back into the collective, so now they want to destroy us.
well, you have to raise the shield!
we can't.
your creation required too much power and we couldn't get our hands on multiple ZPMs without drawing too much attention.
let us out.
your fellow Replicators are targeting human worlds.
they are murdering thousands of innocent people.
if you are serious about following the footsteps of your creators, you will let us go so we can stop this.
Oberoth is too powerful.
if this city falls and we're destroyed with it, this will be nothing more than a wasted opportunity a failed experiment.
you know what that feels like.
that's what the Ancients considered us failed experiments.
well, now's your chance to prove 'em wrong.
all we are asking is that you give us a chance to make a difference.
take this.
what's this?
it's the core drive of a ship's tracking system.
with this, you should be able to pinpoint the locations and movements of every one of Oberoth's Aurora-class vessels in this galaxy.
take this to Atlantis... it will be their best chance of stopping Oberoth.
go up to the Bay... take a Jumper.
come with us.
I can't. Oberoth might be able to track me.
I'll only be a liability.
go.
that's it.
the city's gone.
so now what?
we're already cloaked.
all we need to do is follow the ship out of the atmosphere and catch a ride before it jumps into hyperspace.
catch a ride"?
Yeah.
watch.
re-appoint drive pods.
nice and snug.
you doing OK? - Sure, all things considered.
not bad for a dead woman.
everything'll be fine.
my guess is we're headed back to the replicator homeworld.
once we get there, we can find a ship with a hyperdrive.
and go where?
well, obviously we can't fly straight back to Atlantis.
they'd probably take us out before we had a chance to explain but maybe New Athos.
we can contact them once we get there.
and then what?
how do you think the real Sheppard's gonna react when he sees you?
how would you react?
in a way, I'm lucky.
at least I know I'm the only Elizabeth Weir out there.
you were right.
it's the replicator homeworld. Looks like they've been busy.
what do you mean?
remember those shipyards we destroyed? That's one of them.
they rebuilt it.
and then some! - Good.
then we should be able to find a ship they won't miss.
it's a streamlining programme designed to boost its operating efficiency.
look, the Gate will be offline for, what, one hour, two hours tops.
we expecting someone? - No, Sir, but it's Major Jordan reporting in from M34-227.
you got video? - Yes, Sir.
what's the situation, Major? - Well, Sir, there's someone here who would like to have a word with you.
Hello, John.
Elizabeth! What happened to you? How did you get away?
I'm not Elizabeth. Well, not the Elizabeth you knew.
I have all of her memories and all of her thoughts...
everything that makes her me.
but I'm a duplicate.
I was created by a faction of the Replicators as a means to attaining ascension.
but you... look and sound just like her.
I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true.
this group managed to isolate themselves from the others in order to pursue their study in secrecy, but they were eventually discovered and destroyed.
I... don't know what to say.
this is all very,
strange?
Yeah, I know.
but we need to meet.
we have some information that you can use against the Replicators.
we?
well, I suppose introductions aren't really necessary.
great... Last time I came face to face with myself,
I ended up kicking my own ass.
nice jacket!
Yeah, it's new.
we got...
new versions of those uniforms. The old ones used to...
bunch up under the arms.
Yeah.
you said you've got something for us. - Yeah!
no, my McKay.
Oh, yeah, right.
what is that?
this is the core drive of a replicator ship tracking system.
once it is up and running, we'll be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the Pegasus galaxy.
it's not much, but it's a start.
are you kidding?! This is huge!
we can get working on a modification program...
reconfigure the sequencing... - run it through an Ancient relays so the information's automatically adapted and outputted.
Outputted? Is that even a word?
of course it is! - We can't both be wrong.
look, we need to get started on this now.
not so fast.
where do you plan on doing this?
we're too big of a security risk to be allowed back on Atlantis.
he's got a...
I've got a point.
you two are gonna have to find another way to do that.
not a problem. I'll just go back to Atlantis, get what we need.
we can do the work here. - Oh, this is great!
finally, someone in whom I can have 100% confidence!
I'm looking forward to working with you!
just the beginning!
humanity's about to benefit from one of the greatest living scientific minds times two!
can you imagine?! - I'm trying not to.
we appreciate all this, but the truth is, we came here for another reason.
you were with the Replicators.
what do you know about our Elizabeth, are you willing to help us get her back?
you think this other Keller was telling the truth?
I don't know why she'd lie.
it's kinda weird, that's all.
I mean,
I don't see you for all this time, then five minutes later I find out...
that I'm dead.
Yeah.
don't worry... the moment I learned the truth,
I knew there'd be no going back the way things were... not for me, not for any of us.
I don't like him. - I know, it's odd.
I know I'm me, so who the hell's this other guy?
he's you as well.
no, there's only one me.
apparently not!
he's nothing but a copy, then.
from what I understand, even though he's not the original, he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.
I don't like him.
I didn't really believe it... not until we got out here.
I know.
I was holding out hope as well.
I thought that the Replicators had captured us and implanted the nanites and that they were...
lying to us to keep us from wanting to return.
Yeah, well, it worked. I'm not going back with them.
what?
I've been on my own before.
at least, that's how I remember it.
now I've got these nanites that'll heal me if I get injured.
you are not invincible. The nanites can only do so much.
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.
I understand your anger and your disappointment, but it makes no difference who came first.
you're as much Ronon as he is.
Oh yeah?
Why's he leading my life on Atlantis while I'm treated like an outsider?
their circumstances are different.
you mean we make them feel uncomfortable, so they'd rather not have us around.
given our origins, they see us as a potential threat.
can you blame them?
I guess not.
I'd probably do the same.
still, it doesn't change the...
we'll go back to the camp. - We'll go find Sheppard and Weir.
it's not like this hasn't happened before.
the other Elizabeth got infected by those little nanite things and we figured out how to stop them somehow.
maybe we can do the same for you.
so we wouldn't be a security threat?
you can contribute.
things'll just be...
different.
that's not really the issue, John.
I guess what really bothers me is just knowing that you and the others will always consider me less than what I really am.
that's not true. - Of course it is...
and I don't blame you.
do you hear something?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla. Please respond.
go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?
the Replicators are here.
they managed to track the ship.
John, do you hear me? - Oh, yeah, I heard you.
our ship must have had a hidden sub-space transponder.
all right, run.
what was that?
that way. Come on. - Ronon, wait!
Where's McKay? - He's still at the compound.
Rodney, this is Sheppard. We need you to fall back to the Gate immediately.
Colonel, this is Major Jordan. The Gate is a no-go.
I repeat, the Gate is a no-go.
there's a replicator ship in position ready to take us out the second we show ourselves.
all right, everybody fall back to the Jumper.
Rodney, did you hear me? - Yeah,
I heard you. We're on our way.
regarding the Gate: they have us trapped.
even cloaked, if the Jumper so much as rustles a bush, they will pinpoint our position and blast us out of the sky.
we need a diversion.
what happened? - It's the Replicators. Let's go.
we'll all have a better chance this way.
I don't want you doing this because you feel any less, human?
from the beginning we've been trying to convince ourselves that we're just like you.
now we've got a chance to prove it.
all right.
let's go.
Yeah.
we tricked you, but don't feel so bad. After all, we almost had ourselves convinced.
shut it down!
no-one else is coming.
shall we take a break?
you go ahead.
Oh, Rodney, we've been working for five hours straight.
we should take a break. - Yeah, I will... when I'm finished.
I know what you're trying to do. - Yeah, what's that?
lose yourself in your work to avoid thinking about Elizabeth.
you must realise it's only a temporary distraction.
that's one of the perks of the job.
something terrible happens, you don't have time to dwell on it...
you're too busy trying to stop the next terrible thing from happening.
seriously, if it wasn't for the Replicators and their plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy,
I'd be in pretty bad shape right now.
now, this is Carson all over again and I'm just not ready to deal.
not yet.
you're not the only one who misses him, Rodney.
don't suppose you wanna talk about it. - Eventually, but not now.
OK - Shall I get you anything? - No.
thank you.
you're welcome, Rodney.
how's it going? - It's all right.
why don't you call it a night? - No, I wanna finish this.
what about you... isn't it past your bedtime?
I'll approve the removal of her personal items tomorrow...
have everything shipped back to Earth.
I would have done it sooner, but I actually thought we were gonna bring her back.
Yeah.
me too.
let me know when you get this thing working.
will do.
Oh! Wait!
if this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the galaxy in real-time.
that's not so bad. I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.
on the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.
a lot more!
Oh, crap!
initiating secondary diagnostics... now!
no variances.
are you sure? - Positive.
check again.
Rodney, there is nothing here.
okay, just get over here and monitor the power readings.
no variances. - Hmm.
are you catching any discrepancies on your end?
nothing. - Are you sure?
Rodney. - Okay, just go back. Go back, go back, go back.
all right, do we know what the problem is?
Yeah. The Gate's not working.
I think we figured that much last week when you broke it.
I did not break the Gate.
it just happened to stop working around the same time you were screwing around with it?
I wasn't screwing around with it.
I was running a streamlining program, designed to boost its operating efficiency.
Yeah, well, good job.
it had nothing to do with why the gate malfunctioned.
we've been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my streamlining program, and I feel confident that we're making some progress and that things will be up and running in - [Explosion]
what was that?
an unidentified object just struck the city.
why didn't the sensors pick it up?
I don't know. It came in so fast.
I'm getting a low-level energy signature.
what could it be?
let's find out.
any injuries? - No, sir.
thank god, it hit the reading library, or someone really could've gotten hurt.
what is it?
it's obviously some kind of mobile, self-contained unit.
a drone, possibly a probe-- it's definitely not Wraith design.
perhaps it's Lantean.
a de-orbited satellite or a device on a recall directive.
Yeah, maybe.
it's still emanating that trace energy field.
is it dangerous?
no, it's just interesting.
check that out.
it was damaged on re-entry.
re-entry wouldn't have caused that.
looks like weapons fire. Maybe it took a hit before it came down.
and yet it came out in one piece.
tough little bastard.
Colonel, do we know what it is yet?
looks like a probe of some kind.
any idea who sent it?
McKay and Zelenka'll figure it out.
in the meantime, who's working on the Gate?
the Gate can wait. This is more important.
with all due respect, sir, I think they're equally important.
wouldn't it make more sense to keep Zelenka working on this mystery object and move McKay back to his gate diagnostics?
it's already been over a week now.
major.
not being able to use the Gate is an inconvenience.
the possibility that someone may have pinpointed our location is a threat.
the threat gets priority.
Yes, sir.
this is pointless.
even though the object survived re-entry physically intact, its internal systems are shot.
these are just incomprehensible readings.
by design.
there's no design here, Rodney. Just meaningless data.
but my instincts tell me that's because they're running an advanced masking program to fool us.
they're good, I'm better.
who's "they," Rodney?
just do me a favor.
relaunch your decryp sweep.
humor me.
fine.
you realize we don't have to stand around here waiting for the results. It could take hours.
why don't we go back to the Gate?
hang on!
it's working. I'm getting something.
don't touch anything!
whoa, whoa, what happened?
what did you do?
nothing.
I told you not to touch anything! - I didn't touch anything.
the diagnostic program must've crashed.
we lost all the data.
what did you see, Rodney?
nanite code.
it's the Replicators.
sync: YTET- LQBN - =www. ydy. com/bbs=
this Mortal Coil
it's the Replicators. They've found us.
are you sure?
that drone we recovered contained nanites.
you cannot be certain of that, Rodney.
the program went down before we had a chance to retrieve any significant data.
I know what I saw.
it was nanite code.
a split second before the system crashed - I saw nothing.
that's because you weren't looking.
our laptops were receiving the same data stream, Rodney.
if there had been anything, I would have seen it.
well, obviously, you didn't, otherwise...
another one?
Colonel Sheppard, Major Lorne here.
go ahead, Major.
there's been an explosion in Dr. McKay's lab.
I suggest you get down here.
what the...
what happened?
well, either your sandwich exploded, or that mystery drone had a built-in self-destruct protocol.
we must have inadvertently initiated it when we ran our analysis.
sorry, Doc.
at least you weren't around when it went off.
lucky us.
something's not right.
that diagnostic program should never have crashed.
it was perfectly capable of handling any of the data coming from the probe.
and then before I get a chance to get it up and running again, what happened?
the probe gets destroyed.
what are you talking about?
I don't know... it just feels like someone or something is working very hard to get in my way.
and, yes, I know what that sounds like.
do me a favor, keep an eye open, okay?
you think he's imagining it?
maybe he needs a vacation.
I guess you disagree, huh?
I don't know. It just seems like people are acting different lately.
different?
I don't know how to explain it.
they just...
haven't been themselves.
Teyla's noticed it, too.
well, maybe everyone's getting a little stir-crazy, not being able to go off-world - you know, acting a little weird, - getting a little paranoid. - I'm not paranoid.
people have been acting weird lately.
you make a compelling argument.
you're going to need stitches.
here.
sorry.
what happened?
ronon decided to knock some sense into me.
let me take a look.
you're fine.
no stitches?
no. Not even a band-aid.
there's nothing there.
I was bleeding.
well, not from any head wound.
it was probably Ronon's blood.
no.
he hit me. I was bleeding.
run a scan on me.
a scan?
if McKay is right and there were nanites in that probe, there's a good chance I got infected.
okay. Hold still.
no nanites.
you're clean.
run a blood test.
John, if you were infected with nanites.
forget the nanites.
something like this happened to me before.
I got infected with the retrovirus and I was able to heal right away.
I'm sure that's not the case now, since you haven't been exposed
maybe it's a relapse. I don't know.
I seriously doubt - just run a blood test!
okay.
I thought the problem was dealt with.
I destroyed the drone.
and made them suspicious in the process.
so what do you suggest we do?
they're still a long way from knowing the truth.
for now, we just need to be careful.
Colonel!
I got your test results back.
I'm pleased to tell you you're 100% bug free.
no sign of the retrovirus in your system.
what's the matter? I thought you'd be happy.
all that says is my blood's clean. It doesn't explain the magical head wound.
maybe it doesn't make sense, because you're refusing to consider the only possible explanation for what happened:
you made a mistake.
ronon wasn't bleeding.
I checked.
well, maybe the blood was already on the towel and you mistakenly transferred it to your forehead.
ronon saw the cut.
he was the one who said I needed stitches.
unless he was wrong, too?
all right. I'll run your blood work again.
if I still can't find anything, we'll do a complete physical.
Hey. - Hey.
What're you all doing here? What's going on?
uh... I'll be right back. I just remembered that I forgot to unplug something, or plug it in.
What're you doing?
this may hurt a little.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
what is the matter with you?
here.
I'll need more than that - disinfectant, some stitches - shut up and hold on a second.
all right.
let's take a look.
it's gone.
that's impossible. How can it-- - that's the reaction we were hoping for.
if it's any consolation, I can assure you that we all underwent the same test.
test? What the hell is going on here?
that's what we'd like to find out.
Rodney, you're not the only one who has noticed the strange behavior of many people on this base.
they've been acting unusually withdrawn, even secretive.
Yeah.
I wasn't sure what to make of it.
at first, I was ready to dismiss Zelenka's screw-up as just gross incompetence, but the more I thought about it, the more I thought it didn't make sense, even for him.
it was no accident.
he crashed that diagnostic system on purpose.
I'm assuming what happened with that drone is no accident either.
but what does any of this have to do with my super-healing abilities?
last night, Ronon clubbed me in the head.
by accident.
sort of.
I was cut.
I went to the infirmary to have Keller check it out.
by the time I got there, it was completely healed.
the last time that happened, it was the... it was the retrovirus.
I had her run a blood test.
And? She didn't find anything.
you think she's lying?
I don't know, but we've got to find out.
I can access the infirmary's database from here.
just... do.
okay, I'm in.
now... and...
what?
there's no record of any blood test.
if she did one, she didn't enter the results.
she did a full body scan, too.
there's nothing here.
that's impossible.
the scanner is wired directly into the computer. Results are recorded automatically.
doesn't mean they can't be erased.
all right, we need to run our own tests.
and until we figure out what's going on, we can't risk trusting anyone outside this room.
we have to get into the infirmary without anyone knowing.
I have an idea.
how's it going, Rodney?
I've patched into the lifesigns detector, but there's a problem.
what problem?
just - I'm not sure. Just hold on a minute.
looks like it's working fine to me.
right. Thank you for your input.
is the infirmary clear?
hold on.
this is bizarre. I mean, I can't get it to give me a live feed.
it's like it's stuck on a loop.
well, fix it.
all right, I got it.
what the hell...
now you broke it.
I didn't break it. It's working fine.
is the infirmary clear or not?
the infirmary, the corridors, the surrounding towers.
I mean, according to this, we're the only people on the base.
how is that possible?
off hand, I would say it's not, but right now, I am reading four lifesigns.
let's keep moving.
we have a problem.
let's make this quick.
I've got something.
it's another life-sign.
it's the outer edge of the city.
let's check it out. Come on.
maybe we should...
come on!
what the hell.
nanites.
there's supposed to be a room here.
there is a room here.
easy, easy.
how did you get here?
I don't know.
I can answer that.
this is where we made her.
this is where we made you all.
this explains why we can heal so rapidly.
we get injured, and the nanites effect repairs.
we'd better tell the others.
that won't be necessary.
what the hell is going on?
I'm sorry, Colonel.
you're going to have to come with us.
I don't think so.
that won't do you any good.
I'm warning you, major. Stand down.
go ahead. Shoot.
you see?
you're Replicators?
that's right.
until you began making changes to our base code, we were forbidden from assuming the form of any living human, but now we can take any form we like.
you couldn't replace everyone on the base - Impossible.
only because you believe this is the real Atlantis, and that you're the real Dr. McKay.
so you're saying that we are also Replicators?
no.
you are flesh and blood.
ordinary humans in every way, except that you were manufactured, from the inside out, by nanites, some of which remain in your system, effecting repairs as necessary.
I'm not buying it.
all that you are, your thoughts, your memories, everything was taken from the real John Sheppard and his team when their minds were probed over a year ago.
see, now I know you're lying, because a year ago, Carson Beckett was our chief of medicine.
Dr. Keller hadn't even arrived yet.
this scenario was updated with information obtained from the last member of your expedition to be captured by the Replicators.
you sure about this?
Yeah.
I need to see for myself.
Oh, my god.
all right, we're all infected by nanites.
not infected with. Constructed by.
I don't believe it.
I'm having a hard time with it myself, but it would explain a couple of things.
such as? - Such as why the Gate's not working, for one.
look, if none of this is real, if this is all just a lab rat experiment, then it stands to reason the Gate's not real either.
if this is not the real atlantis, Rodney, you of all people would have noticed.
the stars alone would have - the whole time the Gate's been down, it's been solid overcast.
that's over a week now. Think about it.
when was the last time any of you saw stars?
Dr. Weir.
that's what you named me.
there's no point in calling you anything else.
you're exactly like her in every way.
except that I'm not her.
no.
the real Elizabeth Weir was killed several months ago.
part of her brain had been replaced by nanites.
it was done to save her life, but it made her dangerous.
whenever she linked with other Replicators, the human part of her exerted an unhealthy influence.
at least that's the way Oberoth saw it.
but you don't agree.
why do you think we did all this?
your humanity is what we're interested in.
because the ancients created us with one fatal flaw...
you can't ascend.
that's what you're after, isn't it?
all right, I know this is a lot for everyone to deal with, but we're just going to have to suck it up and refocus.
refocus on what?
getting the hell out of here.
so we can go where? Back to atlantis to resume our lives?
Oh, yeah, I forgot. They're not ours. - Says them.
look, there's no point in denying the facts.
they're telling the truth. We're not who we thought we were.
I may not be the original, but you're going to have a hard time convincing me that I'm not pretty damn close.
our origins do not make us any less human.
not physically, and certainly not mentally, not while we can think for ourselves.
in my heart, there is no doubt. We must return to atlantis.
okay.
we go back, take things from there.
great.
we're all in agreement. We're getting out of here. Now, all we have to do is figure out how.
you're part of Niam's group.
most were reprogrammed, but some of us managed to stay hidden within the collective.
and you think by studying us, you'll discover the secret ingredient?
you are all fully human.
you have the same minds as your original selves, the same thoughts, the same emotions.
more importantly, you have something that's always eluded us, something that kept your kind apart from the very beginning, and made you special in the eyes of our creators.
you would call it a soul.
it is that secret ingredient you referred to, the key to ascension.
that is not something you can learn to acquire simply by studying us.
why not?
a human brain is just an electro-chemical machine.
biologically created, but a machine nonetheless.
everything is quantifiable.
now you sound like Oberoth.
the others have given up on ascension.
they're destroying human populations throughout the galaxy as a tactic in their war with the Wraith.
they're consumed with hatred and revenge.
we believe there's another path.
why are you telling me all this?
you're open-minded, and it's important that we gauge your reactions.
Why?
so we can avoid the same mistakes next time.
they're going to wipe our memories and then start again on another planet.
that probe was sent by Oberoth and the other replicators.
our friends out there tried to destroy it, but they only managed to disable it.
if that thing hadn't crashed into the city, who knows how long this could've gone on.
the point is, this position's been compromised.
once the other replicators find the city, they'll destroy it.
Oh, yeah, us too.
is that any worse than having our memories erased and starting this whole process again?
we've got to find a way out of here.
I'm sorry it's come to this.
listen to me.
you've probed our minds, you know everything there is to know about us, so you should know we will never accept this.
no matter how many times you wipe our memories, we'll always figure it out.
she's right. We're genetically predisposed to being stubborn and really pesky.
you want to understand what it means to be human, right?
you want to know what qualities might eventually lead to ascension.
you can start with compassion.
I understand what you're saying.
and under different circumstances, I might even agree with you.
unfortunately, it's too late.
what are you talking about?
the other replicators have found us.
they failed to break down our mental defenses and bring us back into the collective, so now they want to destroy us.
well, you have to raise the shield.
we can't.
your creation required too much power and we couldn't get our hands on multiple ZPMs without drawing too much attention.
let us out.
your fellow Replicators are targeting human worlds.
they are murdering thousands of innocent people.
if you're serious about following in the footsteps of your creators, you will let us go so we can stop this.
Oberoth is too powerful.
if this city falls and we're destroyed with it, this will be nothing more than a wasted opportunity, a failed experiment.
you know what that feels like.
that's what the ancients considered us...
failed experimen.
well, now's your chance to prove them wrong.
all we're asking is that you give us a chance to make a difference.
take this.
what's this?
it's the core drive of a ship's tracking system.
with this, you should be able to pinpoin the locations and movements of every one of Oberoth's aurora class vessels in this galaxy.
take this to atlantis. It will be their best chance at stopping Oberoth.
go up to the bay. Take a jumper.
come with us!
I can't.
Oberoth might be able to track me.
I'll only be a liability.
go.
that's it.
the city's gone.
so now what?
we're already cloaked.
all we need to do is follow the ship out of the atmosphere then catch a ride before it jumps into hyperspace.
catch a ride?
Yeah.
watch.
okay, redeploying drive pods.
nice and snug.
you doing okay?
sure, all things considered.
not bad for a dead woman.
everything'll be fine.
my guess is we're headed back to the Replicator home world.
once we get there, we can find a ship with a hyperdrive.
and go where?
well, obviously, we can't fly straight back to atlantis.
they'd probably take us out before we had a chance to explain, but maybe New Athos.
we can contact them once we get there.
and then what?
how do you think the real Sheppard is going to react when he sees you?
how would you react?
in a way, I'm lucky.
at least I know I'm the only Elizabeth Weir out there.
you were right.
it's the Replicator home world.
looks like they've been busy.
what do you mean?
remember those shipyards we destroyed?
that's one of them.
they rebuilt it.
and then some.
good.
then we should be able to find a ship they won't miss.
it's a streamlining program designed to boost its operating efficiency.
look, the gate will be offline for what, one, two hours tops
we expecting someone? - No, sir.
but it's major Jordan reporting in from M34 227.
do we have video? - Yes, sir.
what's the situation, Major?
well, sir - there's someone here who'd like to have a word with you.
Hello, John.
what happened to you? How'd you get away?
I'm not Elizabeth.
well, not the Elizabeth you knew.
I have all of her memories, and all of her thoughts, everything that makes her me.
but I'm a Replicator.
I was created by a faction of the replicators as a means to attaining ascension.
you look and sound just like her.
I'm sorry, Rodney, but it's true.
this group managed to isolate themselves from the others in order to pursue their study in secrecy, but they were eventually discovered and destroyed.
I don't know what to say. This is all very...
strange?
Yeah, I know.
but we need to meet.
we have some information that you can use against the Replicators.
we?
I suppose introductions aren't really necessary.
great.
the last time I came face to face with myself, I ended up kicking my own ass.
nice jacket.
uh, yeah. It's new.
we got new versions of those uniforms.
the old ones used to, uh...
bunch up under the arms...
you said you've got something for us?
Yeah.
my McKay.
Oh. Yeah. Right.
what is that?
this is the core drive of a replicator ship tracking system.
once it is up and running, we'll be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the pegasus galaxy.
it's not much, but it's a start.
are you kidding? This is huge.
we've got to get to work on - [Together]: A modification program.
reconfigure the base sequencing - and run it through one of the ancient relays so that.
it's automatically adapted and outputted.
Outputted?
is that even a word?
of course it is. We can't both be wrong.
we've got to get started on this now.
whoa, whoa. Not so fast.
where are you planning to do this?
we're too big of a security risk to be allowed back on Atlantis.
he's got a...
I've got a point.
you two are going to have to find another way to do that.
I'll just go back to Atlantis, and get what we need, we can do all the work right here.
this is great.
finally, someone in whom I can have 100% confidence.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
and this is just the beginning.
humanity's about to benefit from one of the greatest living scientific minds.
times two!
can you imagine? - I'm trying not to.
we appreciate all this, but the truth is, we came here for another reason.
you were with the Replicators.
what do you know about our Elizabeth?
and are you willing to help us get her back?
you think the other Keller was telling the truth?
I don't know why she would lie.
it's kind of weird, that's all.
I mean,
I don't see you for all this time, and then five minutes later, I find out...
that I'm dead.
Yeah.
don't worry. The moment I learned the truth,
I knew there'd be no going back to the way things were. Not for me.
not for any of us.
I don't like it.
Yeah. It's odd.
I know I'm me, so who the hell's this other guy?
he is you as well.
no, there's only one me.
apparently not.
he's nothing but a copy, then.
from what I understand, even though he is not the original, he's as much Ronon Dex as you are.
I don't like it.
I didn't really believe it. Not until we got here.
I was holding out hope as well.
I thought that the replicators had captured us and implanted the nanites, and that they were lying to us to keep us from wanting to return.
well, it worked.
I'm not going back with them.
Ronon... - what?
I've been on my own before.
at least, that's how I remember it.
and now I've got these nanites that'll heal me if I get injured.
you are not invincible. The nanites can only do so much.
I'll take my chances.
I understand your anger and your disappointment, but it makes no difference who came first.
you are as much ronon as he is.
Oh, yeah?
then why does he get to live my life on Atlantis while I'm treated like an outsider?
our circumstances are different.
you mean we make them feel uncomfortable, so they'd rather not have us around.
given our origins, they see us as a potential threat.
can you blame them?
I guess not.
I'd probably do the same.
still, that doesn't change
we'll go back to the camp.
we'll go find Sheppard and Weir.
it's not like this hasn't happened before.
the other Elizabeth got infected by those little nanite things, and we figured out how to stop them.
maybe we can do the same for you.
so we wouldn't be a security threat.
you can contribute.
things'll just be different.
that's not really the issue, John.
I guess what really bothers me is just knowing that you and the others will always consider me less than what I really am.
that's not true. - Of course it is.
and I don't blame you.
do you hear something?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Teyla! Please respond.
go ahead, Teyla. What's wrong?
it's the Replicators! They're here!
they managed to track the ship.
John, do you hear me? - Oh, yeah, I heard you.
out ship must be hidden some ubspace transponder.
all right. Run!
what was that?
that way! Come on!
Ronon! Wait!
Where's McKay? - He's still at the compound.
Rodney, this is Sheppard! I need you to fall back to the gate immediately!
Colonel, this is Major Jordan. The Gate is a no go.
I repeat - the Gate is a no go.
there's a Replicator ship in position ready to take us out the second we show ourselves.
all right. Everybody, fall back to the jumper. Rodney, did you hear me?
Yeah. I heard you. We're on our way.
John, they're guarding the Gate.
they have us trapped.
even cloaked, if the jumper so much as rustles a bush, they will pinpoint our position and blast us out of the sky.
we need a diversion.
what's happened? - It's the Replicators. Let's go.
we'll all have a better chance this way.
I don't want you doing this because you feel any less...
human?
from the beginning, we've been trying to convince ourselves that we're just like you.
now we've got a chance to prove it.
all right.
let's go.
Yeah, we tricked you...
but don't feel so bad.
after all, we almost had ourselves convinced.
shut it down!
no one else is coming.
shall we take a break?
you go ahead.
Rodney, you've been working for five hours straight.
you should take a break. - I will. When I'm finished.
I know what you're trying to do.
and what's that?
lose yourself in your work to avoid thinking about Elizabeth.
you must realize it's only a temporary distraction.
that's one of the perks of the job.
if something terrible happens, you don't have time to dwell on it because you're too busy trying to keep the next terrible thing from happening.
seriously, if it wasn't for the Replicators and their plan to wipe out every human in the galaxy,
I'd be in pretty bad shape right now.
this is Carson all over again, and I'm just not ready to deal.
not yet.
you're not the only one who misses them, Rodney.
I don't suppose you want to talk about it?
eventually. But not now.
okay.
shall I get you anything? - No.
thank you.
you're welcome, Rodney.
how's it going?
it's all right.
why don't you call it a night?
no. I... I want to finish this.
what about you? Isn't it past your bedtime?
I'm going to approve the removal of her personal items tomorrow, have everything shipped back to earth.
I would have done it sooner, but I actually thought we were going to bring her back.
Yeah.
me too.
let me know when you get this thing working.
will do.
Oh, wait!
if this works, we should be able to track every Aurora-class replicator ship in the galaxy in real time.
that's not so bad.
I guess the Wraith have really taken a toll.
on the other hand, my duplicate did say they were building more.
a lot more.
Oh, crap.
you have some Wraith DNA.
my father told people that it was a gift.
I could help my people by warning them of the Wraith's approach.
if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link ...
that's a little reckless, don't you think?
you are all about to die.
you refer to our enemy as the replicators.
they have begun to annihilate human worlds.
we do the opposite.
instead of severing their connections
our shields can't take much more of this, sir.
hopefully, they won't have to.
son of a bitch.
he actually did it.
the replicator ships have ceased firing.
the humans' plan worked.
give me status on the darts.
approaching the replicator city.
the replicator's mass is sinking into the planet.
we do not have much time.
we're not leaving without those darts.
the mass is approaching critical density.
an explosion is imminent.
commander. We must jump into hyperspace.
not until I get what I came for.
the darts are on approach.
we have them.
I have the rematerialized cargo from the darts.
now we have what we need to complete our mission.
spoils of War
Rodney, what've you got?
well, it's only been a week since the battle, but a pretty clear pattern is emerging.
you can see it on the long-range scanners.
the wraith have split up into distinct groups.
now that they're done with the replicators, they're sizing each other up.
too many wraith, not enough humans to feed on.
intel's claiming there are several different factions.
Yes, well, with any luck, they'll find themselves in the middle of nice, long civil war, but what I find particularly interesting is this.
what is it?
that's our old friend, the wraith that helped me save jeannie, and got us all those hives ships.
how do you know?
well, the subspace tracking device he used? It's the same signal.
why would he reactivate it?
well, I have no idea.
I think it's safe to assume that he'd know we were monitoring that frequency.
you think he's sending us a message?
maybe. Look, it's like I said the hive ships that we've been tracking have formed into distinct groups, but this one's out there by itself.
and from what we can tell, it's floating in the middle of empty space, nowhere near a habitable planet and almost an hour's sublight from the nearest gate.
so what does he want?
well, that's the question.
Hey.
do you wish to use this machine?
no.
I just didn't expect to find you here.
why not?
shouldn't you be taking it easy?
I am pregnant, Ronon, not ill.
in any case, dr. Keller said it wouldn't hurt to continue exercising.
in fact, it's beneficial.
you're hitting it pretty hard.
I have to remain in top physical condition if I'm to keep up with you and the rest of the team.
who says you have to keep up?
any change?
no, he's still sitting out there.
it's been almost 24 hours.
his ship could be disabled.
you think it's a distress call?
Ah, maybe.
any other hive ships picking up the signal?
if they are, they're ignoring it.
we're showing no other wraith activity in the area.
how far did you say the nearest gate was?
well, it's about an hour by jumper.
I know we worked with this guy before and he has helped us out in the past, but he's still a wraith.
we don't seriously feel like we owe him anything, do we?
no, no, of course not, but that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out.
Colonel.
I just heard.
I would like to accompany you on this mission.
well, we've got it covered.
John, I understand what you're trying to do, but I assure you, it is not necessary.
my skills have not diminished.
I still have much to offer the team.
all right, guys, let's head out.
we'll wait for you at the jumper bay, sir.
I'm not even
I'm not having this conversation again.
we have not had it yet.
it's been a little busy around here.
I understand why you did not want me to join the attack on the replicator world, but that was a special circumstance.
look, even the simplest op can become dangerous.
and I accept that.
you think it's that simple?
is this about you trying to protect me or are you still angry because I did not tell you sooner?
this is about your people missing.
you want to go out, you want to tear it up, you want to kick ass, but you can't!
and the sooner you realize that, the better.
pull up the hud. We're in range.
I've got it, dead ahead.
looks like it's been shot up pretty bad.
from the replicator battle?
no, I'm picking up residual radiation from wraith weapons fire.
were they attacked by another hive?
well, it looks that way.
any life signs?
I'm not picking up anything.
maybe they're hibernating.
seems an odd thing to do after being attacked.
Plus, they usually land the ship.
all right. Well, we didn't come all this way to turn back, so, uh,
I'm going in.
Lorne, you got anything?
nothing so far.
Oh, we've got bodies.
acknowledged. We'll keep looking.
looks like they were fed on.
still picking up the Wraith's tracking device.
it's that way.
reading's stronger in here.
I don't see our guy.
you?
no.
we're not going to find him.
I thought we were tracking the device.
we are...
but somebody cut it out of him.
no sign of the rest of the crew.
whoever attacked the ship must've taken 'em prisoner.
including our friend.
stop calling him that.
it's weird.
what do you want him to call him?
I don't know, let's go with... Todd.
it's a guy I knew in college. He was very pale.
Todd's a terrible name.
you got a better one?
as a matter of fact, I do. - You know what?
forget I asked.
Colonel? What do we do now?
well, that all depends.
is this thing going to fly?
with a little work, I we can get main systems back online.
that settles it. We've got ourselves a new ship.
Colonel.
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.
no engagement. The only Wraith onboard were dead.
was the ship badly damaged?
she's definitely taken a few hits. Mckay's working on repairs, but that is the easy part.
what's the hard part?
the ship's been secured, there's no immediate danger and you're the only one who can fly it.
even in my condition?
all right, I might have been a little tough on you before.
no, you were right.
I'm just trying to understand my position.
you're still a member of my team.
am I?
you always were.
look, it's my call whether or not you go on a mission.
take it or leave it.
when do we go?
Hey. I found these in the jumper.
Aw, thank you. I'm starving.
well, you don't want it...
no, no. That's fine.
so, how are we doing in here anyways?
I got the hyperdrive operational.
that's not going to help if I can't get the neural interface to work. [
What'd you do?
nothing.
you touched something, didn't you?
no.
maybe just a little.
what is it?
looks like a map.
thank you, captain obvious. Of course, it's a map.
the question is, a map to what?
I wanted to tell you sooner...
but I found out shortly after dr. Keller and I returned from new Athos.
it was a difficult time.
it's okay. I get it.
now, along with everything else,
I'm burdened with the thought that...
this child may be the last of my people.
we don't know that yet.
but you understand
my best hope in learning their fate is to be out here with you.
how's it coming?
Ah, you're back.
well, I've managed to get the neural interface talking to the main systems, but I've got no way to test it, so it's going to need some tweaking.
well, I thought they'd come in handy when we go after the Wraith.
what are you talking about?
I figured out where this ship was headed before it was attacked.
we figured it out.
Yeah, right. All you did was activate a screen.
I'm the one who searched through the ship's log and found the mention of the top-secret Wraith outpost.
what wraith outpost?
I'm sorry, I assumed a level of uncertainty was implied by my use of the phrase "top secret."
in other words, he doesn't know.
the log didn't specify. But whatever this thing is they talk about it like it was sacred.
which is why we got to check it out.
all right, wait, just hold on here a second.
let's just slow down.
we don't even know if this thing can fly
how did you do that?
I don't know.
my abilities appear to be stronger than before.
she's not kidding!
I cannot explain it.
the moment I connected with the ship, everything became available to me.
I can feel the various systems at my disposal.
can you fly it?
I'm not sure.
she's flying it, all right.
you okay?
Yes. I'm fine.
it's easier than it was last time.
almost effortless.
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't do anything.
the coordinates to the outpost are in the computer.
I can take us there.
mm, that's not why I brought you here. We can wait for the daedalus.
the hive that attacked this ship had access to the same information, and, by now, it is almost a day ahead of us.
now, if that outpost is as important as the log suggests, do you really think we can afford to wait?
all right.
get us close, but keep us out of sensor range.
we'll take a jumper from there.
well, what's up?
I decided to go over the remainder of the log for any other mention of the outpost.
And?
nothing. Can you believe it?
this goes back a long way.
as far as I can tell, they haven't been to this place in thousands of years.
so why now?
we've reached our coordinates.
I'm dropping us out of hyperspace.
the planet is just ahead.
I've established an orbit around one of its moons just out of sensor range.
well, all right, let's get to the jumper.
Whoa!
it's all right, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
this is exactly the kind of situation I didn't want to put you in.
I know.
I need somebody to stay behind and fly the ship in case we get into trouble.
of course.
I'm going to have Lorne and his men stay here.
good luck.
anything?
we should be in sensor range...
now.
Oh.
what?
well, there's a space gate.
what, now you're telling me this?
I didn't know! Look, the log wasn't exactly easy reading.
all right, anything else?
I'm picking up an energy reading. On the surface.
any idea what it is?
no.
but there's something else...
a hive ship in orbit.
well...
at least we didn't miss the party.
no guards.
they're probably not expecting any visitors.
what say we keep it that way?
which way?
the energy readings are strongest over here.
how big is this place?
don't worry. I've got an excellent sense of direction.
didn't you say you got lost in a garden maze once?
I was 10! Plus, I was running from a bee.
what the hell is this?
it's a queen.
nice work, sherlock.
but what's she doing?
I have no idea.
Oh, that's just... revolting.
what is it?
Hey, check this out.
Hey! We've got company!
go! Go! Move!
this one is ready.
put him with the others.
I'm definitely going to have nightmares about that.
you think this is some kind of Wraith farm?
that's what it look so like.
the queen secretes genetic material, which gets distributed through the structure into those pods.
presto, newborn Wraith.
nice.
Yeah, I know, it sounds disgusting but it actually makes sense.
you got to emember, they're descended from insects, right?
thinking I don't understand is, why here?
we always assumed that this took place on their hive ships-- but what's so special about this place?
I think I have an idea.
Oh, my god.
pods!
thousands of pods!
patch into the wraith console.
I've got internal schematics.
Whoa!
what?
if I'm reading this right, what we saw from the surface was just the tip of the iceberg.
this thing is miles in diameter.
are there any other chambers like this?
over a hundred.
it doesn't make any sense!
there's no way a single queen could provide enough genetic material to fertilize all those pods.
maybe there's more than one.
Queens don't work together.
at least, not as far as we know.
and we can't let that happen.
well, you've seen how big it is. I doubt our c-4's are going to make much of a dent.
so we fire on it from orbit.
theoretically, that could work but there's another hive ship out there. They'd be on top of us long before we could finish the job.
what about the power supply, huh?
maybe.
guess we could shut 'em down for a while.
that's a start.
only problem is, these readings are coming from all around us.
we're basically in the middle of a giant machine.
I'm not sure I can pinpoint the source.
wake her.
what has happened?
you've done well.
the second batch of warriors is flawless.
we now have a suitable genetic template with which to proceed to the next phase.
where is the commander of the fallen hive?
he's in a holding cell.
he completed the recalibration that was required.
I must regain my strength.
bring him to me.
his understanding of this technology is impressive.
you may wish to keep him alive.
you said the device was ready.
it is.
we are simply making final adjustments before we bring main power online.
then he has outlived his usefulness...
and I must feed.
unless you are volunteering yourself?
bring him!
I believe I'm about to receive my reward.
so be it.
Sheppard. How did you find me?
we followed them.
you picked up my signal. I wasn't sure you would come.
what are friends for?
now...
tell us everything you know, or you're going to be joining your two friends on the floor.
any word yet?
no, they've not been in contact.
guess there's not much to do but wait, huh?
listen, I never got a chance to congratulate you.
that's really great.
I didn't even know you were dating anyone.
my sister has a couple of kids.
two boys, five and seven.
I miss being around 'em.
I'm not really sure what to expect.
nobody ever is.
at least, not with the first one.
but you get through it.
you're going to make a great mom.
thank you.
I wish I could be so sure.
Dr. Mckay is quite correct.
it would be impossible for a queen to breed so many warriors all at once, except by artificial means.
what are you talking about?
the queen creates a handful of warriors, each of which is then reproduced thousands of times over.
this is a cloning facility.
that's why it was key to their victory over the ancients.
we always knew they did it with greater numbers, we just never knew where they came from.
aren't there too many Wraith in the galaxy already?
answer the man.
because we didn't have the means to power it.
the energy requirements are enormous.
he's talking about ZPMS.
I managed to acquire a few before the replicator planet was destroyed.
and I was all set to feel bad about killing you.
my intention was to create an army to wipe out the other wraith but I was betrayed by one of my crew.
he had informed another hive of my plans.
the one that disabled your ship?
this is good news, right?
it means all we have to do to shut this place down is get our hands on those ZPMS.
and I know where they are.
I'm sure you haven't come all this way just to rescue me but it would be in your best interest.
let's go.
through there.
we'll see if it's clear, you stay here.
there's one thing I don't understand.
back when you defeated the ancients, how did you get your hands on a zpm?
the lantians were powerful, but careless.
believing their ships were unbeatable, they sent them deeper and deeper into wraith-controlled territory, trying to weed us out.
it took months, but, eventually, we were able to capture three of them, each one powered by a zpm.
at which point, you brought them back here.
within weeks, our army had grown to hundreds of times its original size.
save the history lesson for later. Let's go.
right.
they've discovered my absence!
well, then we're going to have to move quickly.
this way!
go!
Oh, man.
I got stunned.
Yeah, we know, Rodney. We all did.
how come I'm the last one to wake up?
so, where's todd?
he escaped.
well, that's good, isn't it?
he'll come back for us. I mean, after all, we saved him.
something tells me we're on our own with this one.
something tells me it's not going to matter.
open it.
you're letting us out, huh? That's very kind of you.
bring them.
the commander of the other hive escaped, but I brought you these.
inform the hive.
have them begin searching the area for their ship.
in the meantime,
I have a few questions that need to be answered.
what is it?
I have detected a dart approaching our position.
could be a scout.
have they spotted us?
I don't know.
have you detected any communication between the dart and the other hive?
no.
well, then we still have a chance.
we should destroy it.
Colonel sheppard has flown a dart before.
would've radioed us by now and we can't risk sending out a signal of our own.
charging weapons.
do not fire.
you recognize me?
Yes.
have you seen our people?
I have.
I will tell you everything, but you must allow me onboard.
they were captured?
I saw them get stunned.
funny how you managed to get away.
I was lucky. If I had been captured, they would have killed me instantly.
so how do we rescue them?
by now, they will have been brought before the queen.
so there's still a chance, if you fly us back down there.
you don't understand.
the hive in orbit will have detected my dart leaving the planet.
they will grow suspicious and begin searching for us.
our only hope is to leave now and come again later undetected.
we're not going anywhere.
there is no way to help your friends right now.
you must face this.
wait.
there is a chance.
I have an idea.
how were you able to find this place?
I don't believe that
I have ever encountered such resistance from a human before.
I've had my practice.
well... there is a simpler way.
tell me what I want to know, or I feed on one of your friends.
as you wish.
if you're hungry, I'm the one you're looking for.
this one!
Oh, great. My entire life, I've never been chosen first
and now fate decides to restore the balance?
what is it?
my queen?
take them back to their cell.
I do not understand.
get out!
what did she say?
she's not talking to us.
she's taking control of the queen's mind.
impossible.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
who is this who dares to enter my mind?
who I am does not matter.
what matters is that I am stronger than you.
Really?
even now I am gaining control of your body.
Yes, you do have strength.
I can feel it now.
but even you cannot sustain this level of concentration forever.
I do not need forever.
now... get up!
turn right.
you are hiding something from me.
I can sense it.
of course.
now I feel it.
you're not working alone.
there is another life... inside you.
helping you.
stay away!
you cannot resist me for long!
combined, your two minds are very powerful, but all I need to do is distract you for a single moment to get to the other...
one thought... is all it will take to crush it out of existence.
that was just weird.
weird?
did you see how close I just came to becoming Wraith food?
I don't think "weird" quite cuts it. Like, maybe "paralyzing," or "sickening," or "heart-stopping."
what do you think happened to her?
I'm not sure.
Oh, great. She's back.
here are your weapons.
it's me, john.
Yes.
you are weakening. I can feel it.
Teyla, you okay?
you must go, quickly!
I do not know how much longer I can control her.
go. Move.
can you get her to tell us which way? I kind of got turned around.
just go!
you can let go of her now. We're leaving.
there it is!
the other life inside you.
teyla? Let go.
help me!
let's pull out those ZPMS and get the hell out of here.
the only problem is, we have no idea where they are, remember?
we pulled up the schematics in the pod room.
it didn't have any reference to the ZPMS.
maybe you didn't look hard enough
let's go.
make this quick.
there's a lot of data. I'm going to need a minute.
what was that?
we're too late.
they started to clone the warriors.
forget that. Just find the ZPMS.
I'm going to need more time!
Rodney. - There're hundreds of pages here and it's all in Wraith.
they found the queen.
all right. I got a better idea.
you do?
let's get out of here.
Teyla, are you okay?
major Lorne?
what happened?
I saw them
Colonel sheppard, Ronon, dr. Mckay.
did they get away?
the queen was going after my child.
it's okay, it's okay. Just take it easy, all right?
major
the other hive is on its way.
they've found us.
isn't there another way out of here?
you want a different exit?
it was hard to find this one!
make a decision fast. We've got more of 'em coming.
Oh, crap.
let's get out of here!
the hive ship will be here momentarily. We need to leave now.
not before our people get back.
weapons capability is limited at best.
the hull is still severely damaged.
we can't survive an attack.
Colonel sheppard will be here shortly.
you don't know that.
I have seen them! They are alive, and we will wait for as long as is necessary.
what's that?
the other hive.
they've entered weapons range.
they will target our hyperdrive, making it impossible to escape.
we can't wait any longer!
Teyla, Lorne, come in.
Colonel, where are you?
on our way.
you must hurry. The other hive has found us.
can you hold them off?
not for long.
approaching dart bay.
acknowledged.
they're inside.
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.
negative. I have another idea.
are you crazy?
we still have to destroy the cloning facility.
how? In case you hadn't noticed, we're under attack.
I know!
Teyla, set a new course.
commander
what is it?
we just received an urgent communication from the hive.
the enemy, they're headed straight for us.
well, I think that should probably do the trick.
let's get out of here.
so, what happened to the other Wraith?
you mean todd?
don't ask. - He took a dart.
either he escaped through the gate like we did, or he was captured by the other hive ship.
I can't imagine they could have given him a very warm welcome.
no.
talked to keller?
I've just come from the infirmary.
everything is fine.
at least, physically.
what does that mean?
I exposed my unborn child to the mind of a killer...
even before he has opened his eyes on the world.
he?
it's a boy.
Really?
I thought you didn't want keller to tell you anything.
she didn't.
you were right to question my involvement in this mission.
there was a time when I would have laid down my life for you or Ronon, or Rodney without hesitation.
but...
I have other considerations now.
that's understandable.
you have no idea how close she came to extinguishing his life.
if you had hesitated for even a moment...
you have some Wraith DNA.
my father told people that it was a gift.
I could help my people by warning them of the Wraith's approach.
if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link ...
that's a little reckless, don't you think?
you are all about to die.
you refer to our enemy as the replicators.
they have begun to annihilate human worlds.
we do the opposite.
instead of severing their connections
our shields can't take much more of this, sir.
hopefully, they won't have to.
son of a bitch.
he actually did it.
the replicator ships have ceased firing.
the humans' plan worked.
give me status on the darts.
approaching the replicator city.
the replicator's mass is sinking into the planet.
we do not have much time.
we're not leaving without those darts.
the mass is approaching critical density.
an explosion is imminent.
commander. We must jump into hyperspace.
not until I get what I came for.
the darts are on approach.
we have them.
I have the rematerialized cargo from the darts.
now we have what we need to complete our mission.
spoils of War
Rodney, what've you got?
well, it's only been a week since the battle, but a pretty clear pattern is emerging.
you can see it on the long-range scanners.
the wraith have split up into distinct groups.
now that they're done with the replicators, they're sizing each other up.
too many wraith, not enough humans to feed on.
intel's claiming there are several different factions.
Yes, well, with any luck, they'll find themselves in the middle of nice, long civil war, but what I find particularly interesting is this.
what is it?
that's our old friend, the wraith that helped me save jeannie, and got us all those hives ships.
how do you know?
well, the subspace tracking device he used? It's the same signal.
why would he reactivate it?
well, I have no idea.
I think it's safe to assume that he'd know we were monitoring that frequency.
you think he's sending us a message?
maybe. Look, it's like I said the hive ships that we've been tracking have formed into distinct groups, but this one's out there by itself.
and from what we can tell, it's floating in the middle of empty space, nowhere near a habitable planet and almost an hour's sublight from the nearest gate.
so what does he want?
well, that's the question.
Hey.
do you wish to use this machine?
no.
I just didn't expect to find you here.
why not?
shouldn't you be taking it easy?
I am pregnant, Ronon, not ill.
in any case, dr. Keller said it wouldn't hurt to continue exercising.
in fact, it's beneficial.
you're hitting it pretty hard.
I have to remain in top physical condition if I'm to keep up with you and the rest of the team.
who says you have to keep up?
any change?
no, he's still sitting out there.
it's been almost 24 hours.
his ship could be disabled.
you think it's a distress call?
Ah, maybe.
any other hive ships picking up the signal?
if they are, they're ignoring it.
we're showing no other wraith activity in the area.
how far did you say the nearest gate was?
well, it's about an hour by jumper.
I know we worked with this guy before and he has helped us out in the past, but he's still a wraith.
we don't seriously feel like we owe him anything, do we?
no, no, of course not, but that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out.
Colonel.
I just heard.
I would like to accompany you on this mission.
well, we've got it covered.
John, I understand what you're trying to do, but I assure you, it is not necessary.
my skills have not diminished.
I still have much to offer the team.
all right, guys, let's head out.
we'll wait for you at the jumper bay, sir.
I'm not even
I'm not having this conversation again.
we have not had it yet.
it's been a little busy around here.
I understand why you did not want me to join the attack on the replicator world, but that was a special circumstance.
look, even the simplest op can become dangerous.
and I accept that.
you think it's that simple?
is this about you trying to protect me or are you still angry because I did not tell you sooner?
this is about your people missing.
you want to go out, you want to tear it up, you want to kick ass, but you can't!
and the sooner you realize that, the better.
pull up the hud. We're in range.
I've got it, dead ahead.
looks like it's been shot up pretty bad.
from the replicator battle?
no, I'm picking up residual radiation from wraith weapons fire.
were they attacked by another hive?
well, it looks that way.
any life signs?
I'm not picking up anything.
maybe they're hibernating.
seems an odd thing to do after being attacked.
Plus, they usually land the ship.
all right. Well, we didn't come all this way to turn back, so, uh,
I'm going in.
Lorne, you got anything?
nothing so far.
Oh, we've got bodies.
acknowledged. We'll keep looking.
looks like they were fed on.
still picking up the Wraith's tracking device.
it's that way.
reading's stronger in here.
I don't see our guy.
you?
no.
we're not going to find him.
I thought we were tracking the device.
we are...
but somebody cut it out of him.
no sign of the rest of the crew.
whoever attacked the ship must've taken 'em prisoner.
including our friend.
stop calling him that.
it's weird.
what do you want him to call him?
I don't know, let's go with... Todd.
it's a guy I knew in college. He was very pale.
Todd's a terrible name.
you got a better one?
as a matter of fact, I do. - You know what?
forget I asked.
Colonel? What do we do now?
well, that all depends.
is this thing going to fly?
with a little work, I we can get main systems back online.
that settles it. We've got ourselves a new ship.
Colonel.
I didn't expect to see you back so soon.
no engagement. The only Wraith onboard were dead.
was the ship badly damaged?
she's definitely taken a few hits. Mckay's working on repairs, but that is the easy part.
what's the hard part?
the ship's been secured, there's no immediate danger and you're the only one who can fly it.
even in my condition?
all right, I might have been a little tough on you before.
no, you were right.
I'm just trying to understand my position.
you're still a member of my team.
am I?
you always were.
look, it's my call whether or not you go on a mission.
take it or leave it.
when do we go?
Hey. I found these in the jumper.
Aw, thank you. I'm starving.
well, you don't want it...
no, no. That's fine.
so, how are we doing in here anyways?
I got the hyperdrive operational.
that's not going to help if I can't get the neural interface to work. [
What'd you do?
nothing.
you touched something, didn't you?
no.
maybe just a little.
what is it?
looks like a map.
thank you, captain obvious. Of course, it's a map.
the question is, a map to what?
I wanted to tell you sooner...
but I found out shortly after dr. Keller and I returned from new Athos.
it was a difficult time.
it's okay. I get it.
now, along with everything else,
I'm burdened with the thought that...
this child may be the last of my people.
we don't know that yet.
but you understand
my best hope in learning their fate is to be out here with you.
how's it coming?
Ah, you're back.
well, I've managed to get the neural interface talking to the main systems, but I've got no way to test it, so it's going to need some tweaking.
well, I thought they'd come in handy when we go after the Wraith.
what are you talking about?
I figured out where this ship was headed before it was attacked.
we figured it out.
Yeah, right. All you did was activate a screen.
I'm the one who searched through the ship's log and found the mention of the top-secret Wraith outpost.
what wraith outpost?
I'm sorry, I assumed a level of uncertainty was implied by my use of the phrase "top secret."
in other words, he doesn't know.
the log didn't specify. But whatever this thing is they talk about it like it was sacred.
which is why we got to check it out.
all right, wait, just hold on here a second.
let's just slow down.
we don't even know if this thing can fly
how did you do that?
I don't know.
my abilities appear to be stronger than before.
she's not kidding!
I cannot explain it.
the moment I connected with the ship, everything became available to me.
I can feel the various systems at my disposal.
can you fly it?
I'm not sure.
she's flying it, all right.
you okay?
Yes. I'm fine.
it's easier than it was last time.
almost effortless.
Hey, don't look at me. I didn't do anything.
the coordinates to the outpost are in the computer.
I can take us there.
mm, that's not why I brought you here. We can wait for the daedalus.
the hive that attacked this ship had access to the same information, and, by now, it is almost a day ahead of us.
now, if that outpost is as important as the log suggests, do you really think we can afford to wait?
all right.
get us close, but keep us out of sensor range.
we'll take a jumper from there.
well, what's up?
I decided to go over the remainder of the log for any other mention of the outpost.
And?
nothing. Can you believe it?
this goes back a long way.
as far as I can tell, they haven't been to this place in thousands of years.
so why now?
we've reached our coordinates.
I'm dropping us out of hyperspace.
the planet is just ahead.
I've established an orbit around one of its moons just out of sensor range.
well, all right, let's get to the jumper.
Whoa!
it's all right, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
this is exactly the kind of situation I didn't want to put you in.
I know.
I need somebody to stay behind and fly the ship in case we get into trouble.
of course.
I'm going to have Lorne and his men stay here.
good luck.
anything?
we should be in sensor range...
now.
Oh.
what?
well, there's a space gate.
what, now you're telling me this?
I didn't know! Look, the log wasn't exactly easy reading.
all right, anything else?
I'm picking up an energy reading. On the surface.
any idea what it is?
no.
but there's something else...
a hive ship in orbit.
well...
at least we didn't miss the party.
no guards.
they're probably not expecting any visitors.
what say we keep it that way?
which way?
the energy readings are strongest over here.
how big is this place?
don't worry. I've got an excellent sense of direction.
didn't you say you got lost in a garden maze once?
I was 10! Plus, I was running from a bee.
what the hell is this?
it's a queen.
nice work, sherlock.
but what's she doing?
I have no idea.
Oh, that's just... revolting.
what is it?
Hey, check this out.
Hey! We've got company!
go! Go! Move!
this one is ready.
put him with the others.
I'm definitely going to have nightmares about that.
you think this is some kind of Wraith farm?
that's what it look so like.
the queen secretes genetic material, which gets distributed through the structure into those pods.
presto, newborn Wraith.
nice.
Yeah, I know, it sounds disgusting but it actually makes sense.
you got to emember, they're descended from insects, right?
thinking I don't understand is, why here?
we always assumed that this took place on their hive ships-- but what's so special about this place?
I think I have an idea.
Oh, my god.
pods!
thousands of pods!
patch into the wraith console.
I've got internal schematics.
Whoa!
what?
if I'm reading this right, what we saw from the surface was just the tip of the iceberg.
this thing is miles in diameter.
are there any other chambers like this?
over a hundred.
it doesn't make any sense!
there's no way a single queen could provide enough genetic material to fertilize all those pods.
maybe there's more than one.
Queens don't work together.
at least, not as far as we know.
and we can't let that happen.
well, you've seen how big it is. I doubt our c-4's are going to make much of a dent.
so we fire on it from orbit.
theoretically, that could work but there's another hive ship out there. They'd be on top of us long before we could finish the job.
what about the power supply, huh?
maybe.
guess we could shut 'em down for a while.
that's a start.
only problem is, these readings are coming from all around us.
we're basically in the middle of a giant machine.
I'm not sure I can pinpoint the source.
wake her.
what has happened?
you've done well.
the second batch of warriors is flawless.
we now have a suitable genetic template with which to proceed to the next phase.
where is the commander of the fallen hive?
he's in a holding cell.
he completed the recalibration that was required.
I must regain my strength.
bring him to me.
his understanding of this technology is impressive.
you may wish to keep him alive.
you said the device was ready.
it is.
we are simply making final adjustments before we bring main power online.
then he has outlived his usefulness...
and I must feed.
unless you are volunteering yourself?
bring him!
I believe I'm about to receive my reward.
so be it.
Sheppard. How did you find me?
we followed them.
you picked up my signal. I wasn't sure you would come.
what are friends for?
now...
tell us everything you know, or you're going to be joining your two friends on the floor.
any word yet?
no, they've not been in contact.
guess there's not much to do but wait, huh?
listen, I never got a chance to congratulate you.
that's really great.
I didn't even know you were dating anyone.
my sister has a couple of kids.
two boys, five and seven.
I miss being around 'em.
I'm not really sure what to expect.
nobody ever is.
at least, not with the first one.
but you get through it.
you're going to make a great mom.
thank you.
I wish I could be so sure.
Dr. Mckay is quite correct.
it would be impossible for a queen to breed so many warriors all at once, except by artificial means.
what are you talking about?
the queen creates a handful of warriors, each of which is then reproduced thousands of times over.
this is a cloning facility.
that's why it was key to their victory over the ancients.
we always knew they did it with greater numbers, we just never knew where they came from.
aren't there too many Wraith in the galaxy already?
answer the man.
because we didn't have the means to power it.
the energy requirements are enormous.
he's talking about ZPMS.
I managed to acquire a few before the replicator planet was destroyed.
and I was all set to feel bad about killing you.
my intention was to create an army to wipe out the other wraith but I was betrayed by one of my crew.
he had informed another hive of my plans.
the one that disabled your ship?
this is good news, right?
it means all we have to do to shut this place down is get our hands on those ZPMS.
and I know where they are.
I'm sure you haven't come all this way just to rescue me but it would be in your best interest.
let's go.
through there.
we'll see if it's clear, you stay here.
there's one thing I don't understand.
back when you defeated the ancients, how did you get your hands on a zpm?
the lantians were powerful, but careless.
believing their ships were unbeatable, they sent them deeper and deeper into wraith-controlled territory, trying to weed us out.
it took months, but, eventually, we were able to capture three of them, each one powered by a zpm.
at which point, you brought them back here.
within weeks, our army had grown to hundreds of times its original size.
save the history lesson for later. Let's go.
right.
they've discovered my absence!
well, then we're going to have to move quickly.
this way!
go!
Oh, man.
I got stunned.
Yeah, we know, Rodney. We all did.
how come I'm the last one to wake up?
so, where's todd?
he escaped.
well, that's good, isn't it?
he'll come back for us. I mean, after all, we saved him.
something tells me we're on our own with this one.
something tells me it's not going to matter.
open it.
you're letting us out, huh? That's very kind of you.
bring them.
the commander of the other hive escaped, but I brought you these.
inform the hive.
have them begin searching the area for their ship.
in the meantime,
I have a few questions that need to be answered.
what is it?
I have detected a dart approaching our position.
could be a scout.
have they spotted us?
I don't know.
have you detected any communication between the dart and the other hive?
no.
well, then we still have a chance.
we should destroy it.
Colonel sheppard has flown a dart before.
would've radioed us by now and we can't risk sending out a signal of our own.
charging weapons.
do not fire.
you recognize me?
Yes.
have you seen our people?
I have.
I will tell you everything, but you must allow me onboard.
they were captured?
I saw them get stunned.
funny how you managed to get away.
I was lucky. If I had been captured, they would have killed me instantly.
so how do we rescue them?
by now, they will have been brought before the queen.
so there's still a chance, if you fly us back down there.
you don't understand.
the hive in orbit will have detected my dart leaving the planet.
they will grow suspicious and begin searching for us.
our only hope is to leave now and come again later undetected.
we're not going anywhere.
there is no way to help your friends right now.
you must face this.
wait.
there is a chance.
I have an idea.
how were you able to find this place?
I don't believe that
I have ever encountered such resistance from a human before.
I've had my practice.
well... there is a simpler way.
tell me what I want to know, or I feed on one of your friends.
as you wish.
if you're hungry, I'm the one you're looking for.
this one!
Oh, great. My entire life, I've never been chosen first
and now fate decides to restore the balance?
what is it?
my queen?
take them back to their cell.
I do not understand.
get out!
what did she say?
she's not talking to us.
she's taking control of the queen's mind.
impossible.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
who is this who dares to enter my mind?
who I am does not matter.
what matters is that I am stronger than you.
Really?
even now I am gaining control of your body.
Yes, you do have strength.
I can feel it now.
but even you cannot sustain this level of concentration forever.
I do not need forever.
now... get up!
turn right.
you are hiding something from me.
I can sense it.
of course.
now I feel it.
you're not working alone.
there is another life... inside you.
helping you.
stay away!
you cannot resist me for long!
combined, your two minds are very powerful, but all I need to do is distract you for a single moment to get to the other...
one thought... is all it will take to crush it out of existence.
that was just weird.
weird?
did you see how close I just came to becoming Wraith food?
I don't think "weird" quite cuts it. Like, maybe "paralyzing," or "sickening," or "heart-stopping."
what do you think happened to her?
I'm not sure.
Oh, great. She's back.
here are your weapons.
it's me, john.
Yes.
you are weakening. I can feel it.
Teyla, you okay?
you must go, quickly!
I do not know how much longer I can control her.
go. Move.
can you get her to tell us which way? I kind of got turned around.
just go!
you can let go of her now. We're leaving.
there it is!
the other life inside you.
teyla? Let go.
help me!
let's pull out those ZPMS and get the hell out of here.
the only problem is, we have no idea where they are, remember?
we pulled up the schematics in the pod room.
it didn't have any reference to the ZPMS.
maybe you didn't look hard enough
let's go.
make this quick.
there's a lot of data. I'm going to need a minute.
what was that?
we're too late.
they started to clone the warriors.
forget that. Just find the ZPMS.
I'm going to need more time!
Rodney. - There're hundreds of pages here and it's all in Wraith.
they found the queen.
all right. I got a better idea.
you do?
let's get out of here.
Teyla, are you okay?
major Lorne?
what happened?
I saw them
Colonel sheppard, Ronon, dr. Mckay.
did they get away?
the queen was going after my child.
it's okay, it's okay. Just take it easy, all right?
major
the other hive is on its way.
they've found us.
isn't there another way out of here?
you want a different exit?
it was hard to find this one!
make a decision fast. We've got more of 'em coming.
Oh, crap.
let's get out of here!
the hive ship will be here momentarily. We need to leave now.
not before our people get back.
weapons capability is limited at best.
the hull is still severely damaged.
we can't survive an attack.
Colonel sheppard will be here shortly.
you don't know that.
I have seen them! They are alive, and we will wait for as long as is necessary.
what's that?
the other hive.
they've entered weapons range.
they will target our hyperdrive, making it impossible to escape.
we can't wait any longer!
Teyla, Lorne, come in.
Colonel, where are you?
on our way.
you must hurry. The other hive has found us.
can you hold them off?
not for long.
approaching dart bay.
acknowledged.
they're inside.
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.
negative. I have another idea.
are you crazy?
we still have to destroy the cloning facility.
how? In case you hadn't noticed, we're under attack.
I know!
Teyla, set a new course.
commander
what is it?
we just received an urgent communication from the hive.
the enemy, they're headed straight for us.
well, I think that should probably do the trick.
let's get out of here.
so, what happened to the other Wraith?
you mean todd?
don't ask. - He took a dart.
either he escaped through the gate like we did, or he was captured by the other hive ship.
I can't imagine they could have given him a very warm welcome.
no.
talked to keller?
I've just come from the infirmary.
everything is fine.
at least, physically.
what does that mean?
I exposed my unborn child to the mind of a killer...
even before he has opened his eyes on the world.
he?
it's a boy.
Really?
I thought you didn't want keller to tell you anything.
she didn't.
you were right to question my involvement in this mission.
there was a time when I would have laid down my life for you or Ronon, or Rodney without hesitation.
but...
I have other considerations now.
that's understandable.
you have no idea how close she came to extinguishing his life.
if you had hesitated for even a moment...
hear, hear!
truly, the medical supplies you have given to us over the past several years have made an immeasurable difference to our people.
not to mention your warning last harvest that the wraith were nearby.
you saved many lives.
well, uh, you know.
my favorite missions are when we come here to do our trading.
and I've said that, I can prove it. I'm not just saying that
you don't need to prove it.
you know, actually, we got to get going.
so soon?
Yeah, so soon?
we were hoping that you could stay...
well, I-I guess we could stay a little longer.
I hate to...
no, never mind.
what is it?
well, I wouldn't dream of imposing-- you've been so generous to our people already...
what's the problem?
our sister.
she is in great need of your help.
I didn't even know you gals had a sister.
we do indeed.
and I imagine she's as beautiful as you two.
even more so.
and she's in great need of guidance. - Guidance.
that I can do.
you are most generous.
excuse us for one moment.
I'll get her.
dibs.
what?
I'm calling dibs on the third sister.
you can't call dibs.
look, we both know that flora and mardola have been suckered in by the whole cliche-heroic thing you've got going, but - maybe this other sister, maybe her taste in men will run more to the... - geeky?
I was going to say "cerebral," but, um, who knows. Maybe we'll hit it off.
I don't need your love life screwing up our trade relations.
I'll try not to break her heart, but no promises.
these are the men I was telling you about. Gentlemen, this is our sister... harmony.
super.
harmony
as you know, our mother and queen passed at the beginning of this lunar cycle.
a secret, sacred ceremony was held to determine which of her three daughters would succeed her.
it was determined that harmony shall be the new queen.
Really? Wow. Well, congrats.
before she is crowned, all future queens must perform a time-honored rite of passage.
a rite of passage normally performed alone.
it is not written one way or another.
and harmony is so young. It concerns me greatly.
I can do it.
you are very brave...
but the trail is difficult.
it would bring me great comfort to know that you had someone looking out for you.
what kind of rite of passage are we talking about here?
deep in the forest lies the ruins of the great temple of laros.
every queen must take a pilgrimage before the end of the first lunar cycle of their selection.
once there, she must meditate on the journey that lies ahead of her and pray to be endowed with the knowledge and power to govern her people.
how deep in the forest?
no more than a day's trek.
I see.
Yes. No. Uh... we are very honored, but, um, why don't you just have a couple of your own guards escort her?
although it is not written so, our people will expect their new queen to have completed the journey on her own.
so you don't want her to be alone, but you don't want anyone to know she's getting help.
precisely.
right.
we'd love to lend a hand, but-- - John...
our peoples have enjoyed such a fruitful alliance.
yeah...
one that has greatly benefited both parties.
right...
I'd hate to think that one of us would put that in jeopardy over a simple day's walk in the forest.
when do we leave?
I must confess...
I'm quite looking forward to this.
I rarely get to leave the confines of the castle, although I've had much training in forest survival.
Oh, you have, have you?
Oh, yes.
I have completed three sessions with nolar lumsbred.
he is one of the greatest hunters amongst my people.
three whole sessions, huh?
with the nolar lumsbred?
they were all I needed.
I am a quick learner.
I'll bet you are.
tell me, which one of you is the superior officer?
you mean who outranks who?
Yes.
I'm a civilian, I don't have a rank, but basically, we're equals.
technically, I'm in charge.
I thought so.
you have all the makings of an excellent leader, john.
well, thank you.
you going to eat your powerbar?
Yes, rodney.
I told you, you shouldn't have eaten yours so early in the day.
I'm starving.
usually flora feeds us some sort of food when we visit.
come on, you hardly ever eat yours.
no, rodney.
well, will you give it to me later when you decide not to eat it?
you allow him to question you so incessantly?
I guess I'm just used to it by now.
would it not be easier to beat him?
we don't beat people where we come from.
why not?
well, we find it's not very effective in the long run... unfortunately.
Really?
you are a truly gentle leader, john.
I admire that.
thank you, harmony.
there's supposed to be a rope bridge here.
well, maybe you're reading the map wrong.
no, I think it's pretty straight forward.
how old is this map?
it has been passed down from too many generations to know for sure.
okay, guess that bridge doesn't exist.
you two stay put.
I'm going to try to find a safe way across the river.
don't worry, I'll be right back.
Where'd you find that?
John's bag.
it's not yours.
I'm hungry. - You can't just take it like that.
when I'm hungry, I eat.
what's going to happen when sheppard finds out?
well, he's not going to, now, is he?
Oh, yes, he is, because I'm going to tell him.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Yeah, or what?
I'm the queen.
not yet, you're not, little sister.
trust me, you don't want to be on my bad side.
right? And what are you going to do? Have me beaten?
all right, princess, just hand it over.
Oh... see, now, you're in trouble.
you just wait till sheppard gets back here
I think I found a place for us to, uh...
is that my powerbar? - She stole it.
I did not! - Oh, what? You so did! Tell him!
I would never do such a thing!
the second you were gone, she went into your bag.
you are a liar!
you are a lying liar!
Oh, please, who are you going to believe?
well, if she stole it, rodney, how come you've got the wrapper?
well, b-- I... I was trying to take it back from her, and then she wolfs it down and hands me the wrapper.
Really?
okay, you better come clean, brat.
it's okay, sweetie.
sometimes... he makes me cry, too.
all right, we need to get going here.
all right? I found a path.
can i navigate from the map?
sure, as soon as we get back on the path.
now we go...
right.
correct.
what was that?
that's probably the beast.
sorry, the what now?
the beast.
the protector of the ruins of laros.
did flora not tell you of it?
I guess she forgot to mention it.
don't worry.
when you say "beast," I'm assuming that's a figure of speech, right?
Oh, no, it's a beast, all right...
though no one is quite certain what it looks like.
those who have cast their eyes upon it have quickly perished.
but your little knife will protect us.
I'm the queen.
it will not harm me.
we may not get a chance to tell the beast that.
it will know.
listen, why don't we just tell your sisters we made it as far as the ruins?
we don't actually have to make it there.
they'd never have to know the difference.
I would know.
Yeah, but you're going to be queen, so who cares, right?
I care.
my people care.
listen...
perhaps it would be best if you stopped speaking.
your voice hurts my ears.
well, that beast could hurt my whole body, okay?
so I'm sorry, but this is not what we signed up for.
Sheppard, back me up here.
according to legend, the beast attacks silently.
I thought you said the beast would know you were the queen.
well, it didn't attack me.
John, are you there?
it is strange, though...
the beast is supposed to only attack enemies of the throne.
if it was going to kill anyone, it should have killed you.
I'm not an enemy to the throne.
I'm not! I'm here to protect you.
don't move!
so far, I'm not impressed.
drop your weapon.
we have her.
map grid 11 in the small clearing.
on our way.
hand her over.
you're genii.
step aside, and hand her over.
this is obviously some sort of huge misunderstanding. All right?
I'm dr. Rodney mckay.
I'm a close personal friend of ladon radim.
you know, your leader?
I'm your greatest ally! You don't know who I am?
I'm the genius scientist.
the friend of john sheppard? I gave you the bomb?
no?
nothing?
what do they teach you in genii school?
hand her over. Right now.
okay, let's just talk about this.
I'm growing impatient.
our quarrel is not with you.
once you hand her over, you're free to go.
Really?
Yes.
you wouldn't.
you took a sacred oath to protect me.
I don't remember doing that.
I'm going to count to three.
where have you been?
well, my spidey senses felt an ambush comin' on.
and you couldn't mention it?
not without tipping them off, no.
well, then what took you so long? We just about
I had to take a position so I could shoot all three at once.
you okay?
no. No, I most certainly am not.
this one was going to hand me over to those men.
no, I wasn't.
I saw it in your eyes.
you were considering it.
to save your own worthless, cowardly hide.
I was keeping them talking, you know, I was buying us time. A little thing called "strategy"?
obviously you're too young to know anything about it.
Oh, I understand strategy.
in fact, I'm forming one right now
the second we return to the castle, - I will instruct my guards to-- - all right.
plenty of time to come up with punishments along the way.
but, john...
thumb screws, you like them?
Yes.
thumb screws are good.
we better find some cover. That back-up he called is going to be here any minute.
all right, this'll work.
those were genii.
Yeah, I picked up on that, rodney. Thanks.
so what are the genii doing here?
and why do they want to kill her?
I mean, aside from the obvious reasons.
I don't know.
I don't like the genii.
but you know who they are.
are you trading partners?
not anymore.
but you were. - Yes.
but they cheated my mother on many trades.
she banished them from our land.
what about you, huh?
when you're queen, are you going to start trade back up?
No!
absolutely not.
so maybe somebody in the royal court's a little more willing to play ball.
you know, once the path is cleared.
if I were to die, my sister would succeed me.
but if the genii think that she would be more willing to trade than me, they are sadly mistaken.
you really believe that ladon would give the marching orders to kill a little girl...
even this one?
I don't know how these people work.
maybe he told someone to fix the problem, and this is what they came up with.
it's creative.
knowing why they're here really doesn't help us out.
all right, I need to get a take on how many are out there.
you stay with her, okay?
sure.
all right, stay here, and stay quiet.
of course, john.
thank you for taking care of this.
I'm not sure what I would do if you weren't here.
Mm. Tell me something, doctor.
the place where you sleep at night, is it guarded?
I know what you're trying to do, and it's not going to work, okay?
I'm not scared of you. You're just a kid. A bratty little kid.
I couldn't care less that you're going to be queen. In fact, nothing could impress me less, so why don't you just cool it with the "bad seed" act and just go back to ignoring me?
surely they can't guard you all the time?
squad three, take up position on the ridge.
squad four, move to map grid nine.
acknowledged.
wonderful.
stop it. What are you doing?
I'm burning your face into my memory.
you're...
this way I can give the bounty hunters an extremely accurate description of you.
all right, your highness,
I have had just about enough out of you with this whole
I thought I said keep talking to the minimum?
I was... she was
how many genii are out there, john?
if I had to guess, I'd say all of them.
what, so, a lot of them?
Yes, rodney. A lot.
this will make the pilgrimage most difficult.
that's funny, I was thinking the same thing.
I find we have much in common, john.
yeah
anyway, I figure we wait for nightfall and then head back to the settlement.
back to the settlement?
Yep, road trip's over.
but that would make this journey a failure.
you win some, you lose some. If you want to be queen, you've got to learn how to cut your losses.
but the lunar cycle is nearing its end.
if I do not make it to the ruins by tomorrow's sundown, I will forfeit the throne.
I'm sure they'll make an exception.
no, they cannot. It is our way.
it's too dangerous to move forward.
for you, perhaps
if it's too dangerous for me, it's definitely too dangerous for you.
we're going to wait for nightfall, and then we're going to head back to the village. End of discussion.
fat chance of that.
it's not your decision to make.
I'm the queen. - No. Not yet.
and until you are, you're just a regular kid.
I call the shots.
many would consider disobeying the queen a treasonous act.
well, I'm sure they wouldn't look too fondly on letting the queen get killed.
we're heading back.
you should not be here.
I was careful.
no one saw me, don't worry.
we use this from now on to stay in contact.
does that mean it's not over yet?
no.
her two guardians have complicated things greatly.
they killed three of my men.
Yes, well, they were an unforeseen complication.
my apologies.
your apologies do me little good.
we will increase your pay, don't worry.
threefold.
Threefold?
triple the work, triple the pay.
you want us to kill them all?
if they survive, they'll come back and tell my sister that the genii were involved.
now, we can't have that, can we?
listen...
I've been doing a little thinking.
Oh, you have, have you?
I've got a wraith stunner in my backpack.
she can't weigh more than 90 pounds.
I say we stun her and just carry her back.
well, we can't stun a 13-year-old girl.
it's kind of dangerous out there.
I mean, the forests is crawling with genii.
who knows when she could throw one of her fits?
she'll be fine.
she understands how dangerous this situation is. I talked to her.
I'm sure you did, but she's 13, she's unreasonable, among many other awful attributes.
you know, they say you dislike the things in others that you, in fact, dislike about yourself.
so, what?
I'm just saying.
we're nothing alike. - Okay.
she's a stuck-up, know-it-all brat.
all right, it's about as dark as it's going to get. Let's wake her up and get moving.
Oh, no.
Oh, that sneaky little...
I told you we should've stunned her!
I'm going to kill her.
you really need to work on your child skills.
we have been searching for her for over an hour.
we have had not one, but two close encounters with the genii.
all so some useless, spoiled brat can make her meditation appointment?
more searching, less complaining.
sorry, I'm hungry, and when I'm hungry, I get cranky.
and when you get cranky, you get hit. - Okay, okay.
I wish ronon was here.
you know, you said that out loud, right? I mean, I'm right here.
well, it's nothing personal. It's just he's a better tracker than both of us combined.
hmm, that's true.
okay, I'm starting to hallucinate.
Why? What do you see?
not see. Smell.
I smell food. Delicious, fresh-cooked food.
roast beef, hamburgers, hot dogs, pork on a spit.
chicken.
Yeah, sure, the more, the merrier. - No, I smell chicken.
the nose that knows. Follow me.
Ah. Found it.
it's coming from down there.
told you. You don't need ronon while I'm here.
what do you think?
genii camp?
give me the stunner.
all right, stay behind me.
how did you find me?
we could smell your fire a mile away.
that's okay.
I was finished cooking anyway.
you ran away from us. - You didn't give me any choice.
we've been out there srching for over an hour.
we almost were caught twice.
Yes, it's very dangerous out there right now.
that's why I decided to seek refuge in this cave and make camp.
you made all of this?
Yes, and caught a loden bird.
they're quite delicious.
how?
you made all this with that?
I told you, I completed three sessions with nolar lumsbred.
and they covered all that in three sessions?
I am a quick learner. Do you not listen?
you're mad at me.
our first fight.
I knew it would happen eventually.
we'll laugh about this one day.
I'm sure we will, but we got to get moving.
right after we've eaten the loden bird.
or not.
that sounded very, very close.
are we sure this isn't the beast's cave?
you're so ignorant.
the beast doesn't live in caves.
we should stay here until the coast is clear.
all right.
half-hour, tops.
good. I'm hungry.
I brought you the bird's heart.
my people believe it brings you great luck once consumed.
Thanks, but no thanks.
you're sure?
Prettye, ur yeah.
very well.
are you still mad at me?
no, I'm over it.
that's good.
I don't like it when you're mad at me.
well, don't give me reason to be mad.
very well.
so you're 13, huh?
I'll be 14 in five lunar cycles.
right.
nervous about being queen?
no.
why would I be?
well, it's a lot of responsibility.
I know that.
you've got to put the needs of your people before anything else-- including your own.
some of the time, yes.
no, pretty much all the time.
I'm sure I will strike a proper balance.
just remember... you're not queen because of divine right, you're queen because they allow you to be queen.
if you're mean to the people, they may change their minds. Just remember that.
you know much about leadership, john.
hard-earned lessons along the way.
and I know much about my people.
I hope so.
I think we would make a good team.
as queen...
I will one day need a king...
um, listen, harmony
there's no need to answer now.
I know such an offer must be overwhelming.
you shouldn't make your decision rashly.
well, I'm pretty sure I know which way I'm leaning.
you're a great little lady. It's just that
what the hell was that?
the genii just had a little run-in with the beast.
all right, be a brave girl and stay here with mckay.
how come I always get stuck being the babysitter?
you want to check out the beast?
no, I'm good here.
thought so.
stay here.
this is mardola.
I want an update. What's taking so long?
I have men all along the path to the ruins.
they've gone another way.
well, obviously. They're not idiots.
you should be looking everywhere but the path to the ruins.
I am, but it's night, and this forest is vast and dense.
my men are spread thin.
what if they make it back to the village?
there's no way that I could save relations between our two peoples then.
we've just lost contact with some of my men.
we're heading to their last-known co-ordinates.
maybe we'll get lucky. Teran out.
you're a doctor, right?
Yes. Yes. I mean, I'm not a medical doctor
so you're a liar?
no, I'm a
what do you want?
what does love feel like? - Oh, boy...
because I think I'm in love with john.
Yeah, well it wouldn't be the first time, and I'm sure it won't be the last.
what does that mean?
it means that a lot of people, particularly alien women, tend to fall for john sheppard's good looks and charm.
not like me they don't.
he's a bit old for you, don't you think?
I hadn't considered it.
Yeah, well, he will, so don't get your hopes up.
you're not going to try and influence him, are you?
I won't need to. Trust me.
you don't like me very much, do you?
no, that's not true. I...
I don't not like you.
what does that mean?
it means that you have a very annoying attitude, but I'm willing to cut you some slack because you're still just a child.
whereas if I were grown up, amynnoying attitude would be less excusable?
that right, an adult would, uh...
Hey, I don't have an attitude problem.
and I don't not like you.
well, that's sweet of you to say.
so you promise not to get between john and me?
I promise.
I'll give you this
you're a lot more mature than the women he usually falls for.
thank you, doctor.
what do you got?
two dead genii.
it's not pretty.
multiple puncture wounds.
you mean like teeth marks?
I don't think so.
so... so, what? Claws? Talons? A very sharp beak?
I don't know. It's not like anything I've ever seen before.
over here.
what kind of creature could do this?
it doesn't matter.
we don't leave this forest until all three of them are dead.
what took you so long? I thought for sure we'd lost you!
I ran into genii. Had to lie low until it was safe to move.
so what happened? - I don't know, but whatever that beast thing is, it's lethal.
I could have told you that.
Also...the genii have shoot-to-kill orders for all of us.
Oh. Super.
all right princess, let's move.
wait!
what?
where are you going?
where does it look like? We're going back to the settlement.
but we're so close to the ruins.
and it's almost daybreak.
look, the fact that it's almost daybreak is a bad thing-- we need the cover of night.
I can't come this far and just turn back.
I refuse.
you know, I still have the unner-stay.
harmony, the best thing you could do is go that way.
that sounded a little weird.
hating to agree with the child, but, give me that.
the beast will avoid the ruins.
we'll be safe there.
how far are they? - A half hour or so.
so what do you say?
well, it's better than running into the beast.
I was afraid of this.
that's sacred ground. How dare he?
Hey. Hey! Whoa, whoa. Whoa.
we'll handle this, all right?
um... I'll do that. - I got it. It's okay.
really, just-- just... - steady...
come to papa.
let's go...
Hey! Hey.
what?
you've subdued him.
now we can go.
fascinating.
ancient?
Yeah. Obviously.
it's weird...
this place seems strangely familiar.
it's even more beautiful than I imagined.
something's wrong.
what?
it's not working.
shouldn't you be, like, silently meditating or something?
my pendant... it's supposed to glow.
well, I'll be damned.
let me guess.
Oh, yeah, it's ancient.
it's the pendant of laros.
the queen, and only the true queen, must return it to the ruins.
once here, it is to glow and imbue me with great power.
your sisters kind of failed to mention that.
it is one of our greatest secrets.
it's the testing ground.
what?
I know what this place is!
I've been reading about it. Hell, we've been looking for it for the last two years.
I've seen the schematics.
share with the class.
well, believe it or not, this place actually does controls the beast-- if the beast is what I think it is.
which is?
Mini-drones, if I'm right, and you know you can usually take that to the bank.
I mean, this planet must have been where the ancients first developed drone technology.
it was their main testing ground!
that would explain why the genii look like swiss cheese. The mini-drones went right through 'em!
and that noise the beast was making was more like an electric swarm than a growl.
so the pendant is... - probably some sort of pass-key.
I mean, ancients weren't above protecting their research, even from each other.
look, you need more than just the gene in order to activate or control the drones, otherwise...
Yes, yes, yes, of course! It's in auto-protect mode!
they're trolling the forest, taking out anybody without the gene. That's why they stayed clear of us and went straight for the genii.
the royal pain here must have it, as well.
why isn't it working?
well, maybe because genius over there was messing with the crystal tray?
all right, so?
well, so give me a second to figure out how much damage he's done.
the machine is broken. That's why your pendant isn't glowing.
it's got nothing to do with machines.
if I am worthy of being queen, the gods will bestow the power of pure light and make my pendant glow.
well, who knows what kind of wacky rules they've imposed on it.
I mean, I suppose it's possible that once a generation, the key needs to be reactivated here.
maybe it's the one thing that allows them to use the ancient tech they have back at the castle.
it's complicated, but it will light up. We just need to make some repairs.
you don't understand.
I've failed.
maybe I'm not supposed to be queen.
maybe...
maybe we've come all this way for nothing.
trust me, it'll glow.
wake up.
What'd you do to this thing?
I'm not sure.
I just rearranged the crystals.
don't tell them a thing.
they're going to kill us one way or the other.
can you get it to work?
not quickly. I mean, I can come back with a jumper and a small team and get it working.
listen.
we're going to head back.
No!
if I return with a darkened pendant, - I won't be allowed to-- - yes, you will be queen, I promise you!
it's just busted.
this isn't the type of thing where you get a second chance, john...
please.
I can do it. I just need to focus more.
Whoa! Easy does it.
Huron, come in.
Huron. Come in.
if we don't respond, they're going to come and investigate.
Huron here.
what's your status?
good.
elaborate.
real good.
help us! Help us!
kinda busy, got to go!
well, it was worth a shot.
you got to get that thing workin', fast.
why can't we just run for it?
we're boxed in from all directions.
we've got to get those mini-drones working, or...
or we die.
you know, you're not exactly inspiring confidence.
yeah? How so?
you're hiding behind a foot of solid rock.
how am I supposed to feel out here with only a cool breeze between me and the genii?
you're more than welcome to come get cover for yourself, as soon as you're done with those repairs.
do you have any idea how many crystal placement combinations there are?
more than seven?
try 7, 000.
well, that's less than infinite.
it's going to get very, very noisy when the genii get here.
screaming?
no, these guns, they make a lot noise.
it's very important that you stay put and keep your ears covered, okay?
shouldn't you give me a gun instead?
you're going to stay put, cover your ears, and you're not going to move, okay?
son of bitch! I think I got it!
Harm-- harmony! What did I just say?
you're surrounded!
you have limited ammunition, and I have unlimited men!
we'll take our chances.
if you make this hard, I will make your death as slow and as painful as possible.
okay, what's option number two?
give us the girl, and we'll let you go free.
Never!
they would rather die than deal with the likes of you savages.
when my sisters hear of this, the genii will be finished!
finished, do you hear?
how do you think we knew how to find you, little one?
you lie!
come at us with all you have!
I shall silence you once and for all!
let us handle this, okay?
you have one minute!
it can't be true.
it doesn't matter right now, to be honest.
how can you say that?
did you get that thing working?
well, yeah, before they started shooting at it.
so it's broken again?
well, it was powered up. 50-50 chance it's still operational.
provide me with cover.
I'll make it to the pedestal, summon the beast, and smite them.
there'll be no smiting today, little lady.
you've never even used that thing before.
but I am the queen, and the beast is my protector.
it's a little more complicated than that.
you say anyone with the ancient gene can activate it?
Yeah, as long as they're wearing the pendant.
Exactly!
50-50, huh?
100% chance they'll kill us if we talk about it for much longer.
you got a full mag there?
locked and loaded.
on three?
okay.
Yes. Excellent.
what are you waiting for?
shoot him!
you all right?
Yeah, I'm good. You?
sure, sure.
that was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
you're young.
I'm sure you'll meet even braver men than me as you get older.
not you, usurper!
you're lucky I like you, or you would be hung for treason!
but you...
you saved my life.
I did?
when the genii started firing at me, you threw yourself on me, using your own body as a shield.
Oh, no. No, no, no. I tripped and fell on top of you. It was an accident.
and then...
you pulled me to safety.
you don't...
don't not like me.
you like me!
no. No, no. No, I'M...
Yes!
you saved my life and restored the ruins.
you are a hero, dr. Mckay, both to me and my people.
well, I don't know about "hero."
I mean, exceptionally courageous, perhaps...
and modest, too.
it's time to go, before the genii come back.
I doubt it.
they are a simple people, and I'm sure they were most impressed by your actions.
I, however, was not.
the pendant still glows.
the gods have deemed me worthy.
now we can go.
you've returned!
what are you doing? These are my private quarters.
it's all right, mardola. They've already searched my room.
you should allow it.
Why?
the genii attacked us.
it was a good thing colonel sheppard was there to protect you.
they knew the location of the ruins, mardola.
how?
you ask as if I would know.
you're too young to be queen, harmony!
perhaps...
but when you're released from prison, you'll be too old to remember.
Dr. Rodney mckay and colonel john sheppard, your contribution to my people may never be repaid.
well, we didn't do it for compensation, your highness-ness.
kiss-ass.
I personally owe you a debt of gratitude for your help defeating the regicidal genii.
I've had one of the court's finest artisans feature you in a rendering of our glorious victory.
Yeah, pretty much how I remember it.
I think I've cracked their trojan, and I've got an address.
Barrett and I are on our way there now.
you're coming with us.
you okay?
two men, they must have followed us.
he's not here, they took him.
who are you?
my name is Henry Wallace.
she's suffering from acute lymphocyctic leukemia.
Sharon was injected with the first batch of nanites one week ago.
get the nanites fully operational, then I'll let you go.
Daedalus, this is sheppard.
we need a lift.
I watched it last night.
there was hardly any fighting.
that's because it's not about fighting.
then why's it called blades of glory?
because it's about skate blades.
and this is a real sport?
men and women dancing around on ice?
unfortunately.
your planet's weird.
mm, you can say that again.
Colonel.
I was just coming to see you. Do you have a minute?
Yeah, sure.
I received a message from stargate command.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
okay...
your father suffered a heart attack last night.
I'm sorry, John, but he passed away.
I, uh... heard what happened.
outcast
I'm very sorry.
Thanks.
you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
you know, I requested to go back with you, but the ancient device on m7g-677 is malfunctioning.
isn't that the planet with all the kids?
Yeah.
that should be fun for you.
Oh, believe me, I'd get out of it if I could,
I guess it's just bad timing.
don't worry about it.
if you want to, - talk or-- - Rodney.
I'm fine.
right.
where are you going?
a lot of people.
Yeah, well, my old man was pretty well connected.
I wasn't sure you were going to make it.
it's good to see you.
I contacted your unit commander at peterson, but...
sometimes those messages don't seem to reach you.
well, I came as soon as I heard.
this is Ronon. Ronon, this is Dave, my brother.
Yeah, nice to meet you. - Pleasure.
you two, uh, work together, in the air force?
he's a civilian contractor.
right.
anyway, John, I think we should probably talk.
Yeah.
I'll catch up with you later.
this is free, right?
Yes, it's free.
Thanks.
lots of food over there.
I'm good.
this the house you were raised in?
one of 'em.
it's nice.
Yeah, I couldn't wait to get out of here.
well, my dad's idea of teenage rebellion was going to Stanford instead of Harvard.
never mind. He just...
he had everything planned out for me since I was about 14.
so what do we do now?
well, mostly, people sit around, drink, eat...
some more than others. Mostly they talk.
they don't know what to say, but they talk.
Yeah, well, your brother seems to be handling it well.
that's what he does-- he handles things.
how come you never mentioned him before?
it's complicated.
I told you I had an ex-wife, right?
Yeah, why?
here she comes.
Hi, John.
I didn't expect to see you here.
I'm very sorry.
Nancy, Ronon.
Ronon, Nancy.
pleased to meet you.
how long you are you here?
just for today.
I have to be in Washington tomorrow, so...
still with homeland security?
Yeah. I just got promoted.
I'm a director now.
Congratulations.
How's... how's Greg?
grant. Grant.
he would've come, but he's trying a case in Phoenix.
well, sounds like he's doing well.
Yeah. He is. He's, uh...
Yeah, he's doing well.
you know, your dad was always very good to me.
in his mind, marrying you was probably the best thing I ever did.
okay.
it's good to see you again, John.
take care of yourself.
it's nice to meet you.
Oh. Nice to meet you.
lieutenant-colonel John Sheppard?
Yes.
my name is Ava Dixon. You must be Ronon.
do I know you?
no, we've never met, but you knew the man I used to work for-- Henry Wallace?
doesn't ring a bell.
look, I realize you have to keep up appearances in public, but I don't have time to play games.
Henry Wallace was the man who kidnapped your colleague, dr. Rodney Mckay, and forced him to work on a highly illegal research project involving alien technology
who the hell are you?
we need to talk. But not here.
take her to the car.
John, I was thinking that we should prob
something came up, I've got to go.
it's dad's wake.
I know, but this is work-related.
what is it, top secret? National security, that sort of thing?
something like that.
you know, this is so typical.
you got something to say, just say it.
look, there's just one thing I want to know
what's your level of expectation here?
what are you talking about?
I mean, are you going to challenge the will?
I have no idea what it says, of course, but I think I can guess.
that's what's you want to talk about? You want to talk about money?
that's why you're here, isn't it?
you've been gone a long time, John. It's not such a stretch.
you got nothing to worry about.
Hey!
if I've got the wrong impression of you, it's not my fault.
you're the one who left, remember?
I stayed.
I looked after dad, I ran the business, while you were off doing god knows what.
I'm assuming that's what dad wanted.
no. No, it's not, John.
dad regretted what happened between you two.
right up until the end.
I would've come to you sooner, but you're a hard man to find.
all right, you've got our attention. What's this all about?
for the past three years, I've been working for a company called Stanton research, a division of Devlin medical technologies.
I was recruited out of college by a brilliant scientist named dr. Richard Poole, and together we worked on secret project, codename archetype.
what kind of project?
we were experimenting with nanite programming, trying to increase the complexity of their interactions.
listen, I wasn't aware of what happened to dr. Mckay and his sister until much later.
at the time, all I knew was that we'd been given a key piece of programming, something that allowed us to make a major breakthrough.
what are you talking about?
well, it's one thing to inject nanites into a mechanical or a biological system for the purpose of affecting changes at a molecular level, but it's quite another to use them as building blocks to create an entirely self-sustaining entity.
to be honest, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime.
but, then, all of a sudden, we began making incredible advancements, and, the next thing I knew, there it was.
you built a replicator?
technically, that term isn't accurate, because self-replicating isn't one of its primary directives, but...
Yes.
there's no way you had authorization to do this.
richard told me the project was being funded at the highest levels.
and you believed him.
maybe it sounds a little naive, but, well, Richard was like a father to me.
my own parents died when I was very young, and I trusted him.
but then one day, he came back to the lab in a panic.
what's happening?
there's been a security breach. We have to shut everything down.
I don't understand.
look, I don't have time to explain it to you right now. Just do it!
I later found out what was really going on.
the I. O.A.S investigation of Devlin medical was closing in, and Richard wanted to get rid of the evidence.
I'm sorry about this.
he killed to escape.
if he's threatened, he could kill again.
I had to do something.
you're telling me there's a replicator loose on earth?
that's right.
how long?
well, he escaped three weeks ago.
we've been working on a way to track him, but so far have had no success.
he could be anywhere by now.
show your hands!
get 'em up!
sir, the facility is secure.
looks like he was the only one here.
Colonel Sheppard, and Ronon, of course.
how did you find me?
well, we had a little help.
I'm sorry, Richard.
Ava. My god. Do you realize what you've done?
I didn't have a choice. I couldn't let this continue any longer.
I had the situation under control!
your little science project got two of your own men killed and he's still on the loose. I don't think you have control of anything.
he killed in self-defense!
if he's not threatened again, he won't harm anyone!
well, that's because we're going to find him, and we're going to neutralize him and you... are going to help.
apollo, we're ready.
all right.
let's start with giving me the access code to the data files we recovered.
I don't think so.
you do know we will crack it eventually.
the entire directory is encrypted with an 448 bit key symmetric algorithm.
good luck.
what about you?
I never gave her the code.
it was for her own protection.
look...
I'll cooperate, as long as you guarantee that I get to bring him in.
forget it.
we're talking about an incredibly advanced and valuable piece of technology here.
you've had your chance. Now it's my turn. Are you going to help us track this thing or not?
I'll help you, Colonel.
Ava-- - be realistic,Richard.
he's out there alone.
you know he's not programmed for ordinary social interaction.
what happens if someone accidentally frightens him or corners him?
we can't afford to wait any longer.
Colonel Sheppard.
you two know each other?
Yeah, Bates served on Atlantis when we first got there.
then he got into it with a Wraith and took a pretty good beating.
he got the drop on me, but I still managed to get in a few shots. How're you doing?
you're with N.I.D?
after the air force gave me an honorable discharge due to my injuries, the I.O.A. contacted me.
they were starting up a new field division, dealing specifically with operational threats on earth, and it seemed like a good fit.
well, it's good to see you back in action.
you too, sir.
you don't have to call me that anymore.
I guess not. Old habits die hard.
so how are our prisoners?
the girl's cooperating.
what about dr. Poole?
Ah, not so much.
can we track the replicator without him?
got a guy working on it.
stupid emergency contact number.
never should have answered that damn phone.
come on, doc. It's not so bad.
it was my first vacation in three years!
two weeks, all-inclusive... nothing but surf, sun, and skimpy bikinis as far as the eye could see.
and then they beamed me right out of the damned hotel room!
looks like they did you a favor. Next time, use a little sunblock, all right?
give it another shot.
it's working.
this sensor technology is incredible. Is it alien?
sorry, I forgot. I'm not supposed to know any of this.
Oh. Hey, I'm picking up a signal.
let me see if I can narrow in on this a bit.
there, he should be in there.
how big of an area is that?
that's about five city blocks.
seal it off, get everyone out.
we'll call it a chemical spill. I'll get my people on it.
I need to know what I'm up against. What kind of capabilities does this thing have?
speed, strength, agility all well beyond normal human levels.
what about tactics
escape, evasion-- does it have any military training?
I wasn't responsible for that aspect of his programming.
see, I've had this really crappy few days, so I'm beginning to lose my patience...
so whatever you can do to make this easier may work in your favor.
where, at my trial?
in front of a judge and jury of my peers? We both know that's not going to happen.
they're going to put me in some deep, dark hole at area 51, never to be heard from again, and nothing I say or do now is going to make any difference.
well, maybe not for you.
what about the girl?
she didn't know that this technology was obtained illegally.
she's completely innocent.
like you said... there isn't going to be a trial.
but she's helping you!
not good enough.
what's it going to be, doc?
all right. So where do we start?
well, doc?
he's in defensive mode. Basically, he's hiding.
he'll be where he's least likely to encounter people.
well, that would be this warehouse here. It's been abandoned for months.
the company went bankrupt.
and you won't need these.
he's specifically designed to be resistant to current anti-replicator technology.
so what do we hit him with?
well, without access to base materials, he has a limited ability to self-repair...
but if you insist on damaging him, conventional weapons ought to do the trick, although you'll need a fair amount of firepower.
firepower we can do. What's he going to do when he sees us?
he'll continue to evade as long as possible.
he'll counterattack only as a last resort.
all right, listen up.
let's try to get this right the first time.
we're going to operate in teams of two.
your objective is to find the target.
once you do that, you will not engage him.
you will radio in his position.
we'll coordinate, see if we can't corral him into a corner.
at which point, we will bring as much force to bear as we can, and take him out, all right? Let's do this.
Dr. Poole, you're with me.
I'm good.
How're you doing?
one hell of a week.
Yeah.
what is it?
it's him.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
go ahead.
we got a visual on the target.
he's hiding out in a building about a hundred yards due east of my start position.
looks like he's alone.
stay put! We'll be there in a minute.
understood. Bates out.
Hello?
it's okay.
you can come out now.
I'm here to help you.
good.
okay, listen to me.
there are men out there who are looking for you.
it's all right. They won't hurt you, as long as I can convince them that you're not a threat.
how did you find me?
your nanites give off an energy signature. We were able to track it.
that's why you can't run anymore.
you have to do as I say.
you have to self-deactivate.
you've done it before, in the lab, many times.
I was always right there to help you get back online.
this isn't any different.
now, you have to trust me.
everything is going to be all right.
I'm sorry.
apollo, this is sheppard. I need you to beam up agent bates immediately.
Where's dr. Poole?
Hey! Over here.
he's dead.
Dr. Lee, come in.
we've got a problem. Poole's dead.
are you still tracking the replicator?
Yeah. Just hang on.
okay, I've got him. He's on the move, he's heading south-- he's right by
what?
I just lost the signal.
crap.
it wasn't me. He just disappeared.
well, get him back online. Ronon and I are going after him.
sorry, sir.
I know we weren't supposed to engage, but he came from out of nowhere.
he hit us before we knew what was happening.
all right, it'll be okay, sarge, sit tight.
take care of him.
all right, so much for evasion.
he's desperate. He knows we have him trapped.
this is sheppard.
change of plans.
fall back, create a defensive perimeter.
ronon and I are going to flush him out.
let's go.
heading southeast, toward the water.
copy that.
hold your fire!
we've checked the whole area twice. No sign of him.
which means he could be anywhere by now.
what about the tracking system?
Dr. Lee's working on it, but the sensors haven't picked up anything yet.
he must have found a way to mask the signal.
great, back to square one, then.
sorry, guys.
I've managed to boost the sensitivity 200%, but I still can't pick anything up.
how's it going with those files from the lab?
well, I'm running a decryption program, but it's slow going. I may have to make a few tweaks.
focus on that for now.
we don't know there's anything in there that's going to help us track him.
well, I know, but something's not right.
what do you mean?
why'd Poole go in there? Why'd he risk his life?
he thought he could talk the replicator in.
even if that worked, even if we decided not to destroy that thing, that doesn't change the fact that Poole was going away forever.
maybe he didn't want to see his life's work destroyed.
no, that's what he wanted us to think, but I'm not buying it.
he's been spoon-fed half this technology. He stole the rest. No, he wanted to save the replicator because he thought it would do him some good.
I'm thinking he's got a buyer, somebody who can get him out of this if he delivers the goods.
I know the type.
military, or ex-military, probably a colonel. Not a general, too high profile.
regular I.O.A. Channels won't help.
these guys operate in the shadows with no official authorization.
that way, everyone's ass is covered.
so, where does this leave us?
well, this is a surprise.
Why's that?
two John Sheppard encounters in two days?
I hardly saw you that much when we were married.
what can I do for you?
I need a favor.
a project possibly codename "archetype ."
you want me to use my security clearance to get you classified information?
well, I didn't say it was a small favor.
do you know how hard I've worked to get to where I am?
if I get caught doing something like this, I could lose everything.
well, I know. I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important.
all right, what's it about?
I can't tell you.
that's typical.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
and now you want me to put my job on the line, you won't even tell me why?
all right. When you put it that way, it sounds a little crappy.
well, I'm glad you noticed.
it's too bad you didn't a little earlier... say, like, when we were still together.
when I think back to all those times that you would just take that call and leave, no apologies, no explanations...
for all I knew, you were halfway around the world flying secret missions into Somalia
that's ridiculous. I've never been to Somalia.
north korea, then.
there's a big difference.
I put up with your secrets then, John.
I don't have to do it now.
right.
Hey.
Colonel.
they said I could come, take some of his personal things.
I'm sorry about what happened.
me too.
he died thinking I betrayed him.
you don't know that.
that's nice of you to say, but this project meant everything to him.
well, maybe you meant something to him too.
you never know what people are thinking.
even those you're closest to?
especially those.
Colonel?
look, I know this is not a good time, but I got to ask you something.
what is it?
did anyone else know about this project?
no.
no one came to check on your progress?
richard and I were the only ones who had access to the lab.
was he in contact with anyone? Maybe from in the military-- phone, emails?
not that I know of.
all right.
Colonel, how's it coming with the sensors?
it's not, but dr. Lee says he's pretty close to breaking the encryption code.
I thought that was impossible.
hmm, guess not.
well, how's it going?
I was just about to call you.
I managed to open those files from the lab.
nice work. Anything interesting?
you could say that. Stanton research personnel records.
that is Ava Dixon's file.
she was in a car accident last december.
head-on collision.
she's been dead for almost a year.
is he dead?
no... but he's going to have a hell of a headache.
Colonel Sheppard, "I never meant for any of this to happen. I'm very sorry. Ava.
so, she's a replicator?
Yeah, it looks that way.
I've got two sets of blueprints-- one male, one female.
what about the sensors?
we've got nothing. She's masking her energy signature, same way the other one did.
it doesn't make any sense. She came to us. Why didn't she just keep her mouth shut?
come on, a replicator with a conscience?
well, her programming is distinct from the other one.
he's a military model, she's designed for social interaction, simulation of emotions, maybe even empathy.
he built her to replace a dead woman from his past.
does that mean she can't kill?
I'd say it's less likely, but not impossible.
well, we need 'em both. Anything useful left in those files?
well, not much so far.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
this is Sheppard. Go ahead.
you've got an urgent message, sir, relayed through peterson.
well, you really got the cloak-and-dagger thing down.
I learned from the best.
it's everything I could find on archetype.
it's not much, but... whatever it is, no one will touch it with a ten-foot pole.
Yeah, right. I owe you one.
damn right you do.
you know, it's funny.
when you and I were together, I couldn't stand it when you wouldn't be able to tell me where you were going or what you were doing...
and, now, every once in a while,
I catch Grant looking at me the same way.
when I was doing my snooping around,
I took the liberty of asking a few questions about you, John.
that's really not such a good idea.
Yeah, I got that impression.
I've seen walls go up quickly before, but never like this, and whatever you're into, it's obviously big, and my guess is, very dangerous.
I just want you to be careful.
well, you know me.
Yeah. That's the problem.
goodbye, john.
well, she wasn't kidding. So far, it's a whole lot of nothing.
lab requisitions, non-disclosure agreements...
Oh, here's an exciting one
an internal memo reminding employees not to use the south parking lot due to ongoing repaving.
hold on.
what is it?
it's a shipping waybill with instructions to deliver a load of preassembled masonry panels to a warehouse in reading.
so?
so?
preassembled masonry panels
that was a code word we used a few months back to identify shipments of neutronium.
Neutronium--it's the base element from which nanites are made.
you guys damaged him, right?
so, if he wants to fully repair, he's going to need this.
so he's going to go for the warehouse?
Yeah, exactly. - Assuming he knows where it is.
well, to be perfectly honest, we don't have anything else.
that's a good point.
all right, I'll set up a stake-out, and if he shows up, we'll know about it.
this could be our last shot at this guy.
we got to make sure he goes down for good this time.
that's not going to be easy.
I mean, if this was the movies, we'd drop him into a vat of molten steel or...
a volcano.
you know, the fires from whence he came?
what the hell's he talking about?
that's a really good idea.
Really?
Sheppard, this is Apollo. We're all set.
understood.
are you sure he's going to show up?
the I.O.A. said they spotted him nearby.
and what if he spotted them?
Bates, see anything?
negative. All quiet over here.
be patient. He'll show up.
you should not have interfered.
now!
what happened? Where did you send him?
low earth orbit.
I know by experience, re-entry's a bitch.
the I.O.A. isn't just going to let her go.
well, if she stayed away, we never would've found her.
the only reason she's here is because she chose to help us.
Yeah, I know.
she's a machine.
well, we're all machines, just different kinds.
what about if we took her to another planet?
somewhere with no people, where she can't do any harm.
I don't think that's much of a reward.
the I.O.A. would never agree to let her leave earth anyway.
she could work at stargate command.
she would be a valuable asset.
she'd be a constant security threat.
we don't know that.
no, he's right.
there's no escaping the fact she's a replicator.
so what, then?
how are you settling in to your new life?
it's a bit of an adjustment.
one of the stipulations of my release is that I don't look for a job in any scientific field. To be honest, I'm not sure what I'm going to do.
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
I wanted to thank you, colonel.
I know they never would've agreed to let me go if you hadn't put in a word for me.
well, you saved my life. Putting a word in is the least I could do.
I have to admit, I'm a little scared.
I mean, I know these emotions are supposed to be artificial, but they seem pretty real to me.
well, what do you got to be scared about?
well, I've never really been alone before.
richard was the closest thing I ever had to family.
anyway, it was nice for you to check up on me.
I guess we'll never see each other again.
well, one thing I've learned about my business is never say never.
goodbye, colonel.
so? How was it in there?
well, it was very nice work.
very convincing.
I'm just glad we were able to download her consciousness intact.
anyway... now she has a whole virtual world to explore.
should keep her pretty busy for a while.
so, what happened to the rest of her?
Oh, they deactivated the bond between her nanites, effectively breaking her into base elements.
they scrapped her.
yeah? So, we heading back?
Yeah. You go ahead. I got a few things to take care of.
come in.
=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
I believe I had a vision last night.
I saw kanaan, the father of my son.
save us.
where are you? - Dart
I came for you, just like you asked.
like I asked.
I was the one in your visions.
I was sent back in time?
in fact, you were sent forward.
I've loaded all the intel we got on michael after your disappearance, including the address where we found teyla.
quickly.
you must release me.
I know where teyla is.
my child is of no concern to you.
I have great plans for him.
I think we're too early, though, but he's going to bring her here to have the baby.
Colonel, it's a booby trap!
we've got to get out of here now!
this is perfect.
just what I needed.
it truly has been a hectic several weeks.
try four years.
very true.
in a way, it makes these calmer moments even more special.
I cherish these times, when it is just you and me.
me too.
you...
you've got an early morning.
I never got to properly thank you.
for what?
for what?
for rescuing me.
from michael.
I never gave up hope, because I knew.
I knew that you would come for me, john.
I know this sounds crazy, but...
I don't remember...
rescuing you.
you don't remember rescuing her, because you didn't, just like you never rescued me.
Hey, buddy.
what happened?
Michael's compound, it collapsed on us.
I think I...
Yeah, hold on, let me take a look.
what the hell was that?
it's just a little scrape, no big deal.
what about the others?
I don't know.
we got separated.
try them on the radio.
there's no signal.
there's too much interference.
I'm pretty sure my leg is broken.
I think I'm remarkably fine.
well, isn't that wonderful.
that brings me great comfort.
thank you.
I don't think we're that deep.
I can see daylight.
if I could just...
I'm sorry!
I just posted edison at the entrance to the building.
he'll get help.
that is, assuming he wasn't hit by falling debris.
doc, the daedalus left atlantis while we were still confirming sheppard's story.
with that kind of a head start, they should be here in less than three hours, so one way or the other, help is on the way.
I'm sorry, I'm just not good in tight spaces.
but there's no bad guys around, okay?
no bad guys, just a lot of debris, so if you could please just sit tight and try not to make the ceiling collapse, that would be great.
okay, no bad guys.
just sit tight.
when did you get this?
moments ago.
change of plans.
we're setting a new course.
our compound has been compromised.
unscheduled off-world activation!
it's lieutenant edison's idc.
search and Rescue
what happened? Where's the rest of your team?
there was a massive explosion.
everyone was in the main compound. The whole building imploded on itself.
were there any survivors?
radios are down.
I don't know. I just thought I should get back here, and
no, you did the right thing.
get him to the infirmary.
how far away is the daedalus ?
still two hours out.
we can't wait that long.
have the combat engineers gear up, and have dr. Keller ready her away team.
Yes, ma'am.
what are you doing?
I'm claustrophobic. I'm trying to keep my mind busy, which is hard, because, you know, it's my mind.
well, there's no way anything useful survived that implosion.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
you know what I mean, doc.
look, I found a bunch of computer parts, all right?
the motherboards are all fried or snapped, but some of these hard drives look like they might still be intact.
if I could just get the power to...
Hello, hello.
what, is it something good?
I don't know. There's a lot of information.
hold on.
I think I just hit the jackpot.
what, some way to broadcast a signal?
let people know our location? Speed up the rescue, what?
no, although, in hindsight, I would say you're right, that should probably be considered "the jackpot," but no, this is a hard drive.
I can only access what's on it.
which is?
it's michael's wiki.
it survived the explosion.
the what?
Michael's database.
it's a large chunk of it, maybe the whole thing, too.
I mean, we've got base schematics, medical research information, lists of planets.
do you know what this means?
Yeah, it means we're still stuck here, and I still have a broken leg.
Yeah, in the short term, but if we get out of here
if?
we have him on the run. He'd be finished!
look, if michael
Oh, no.
what?
look, I-I don't want to concern you any more than you actually already are, but if I'm reading this correctly, then michael is
shut up.
no, no, you shut up. This is important.
if michael is
quit making noise!
it's footsteps.
okay, revise that. Start making noise.
down here!
we're down here!
help! Help!
all right, we've got four lifesigns in two different locations.
first two should be right beneath us.
listen...
we're down here!
down here!
down here!
McKay? Is that you?
Oh, thank god, yes!
I'm trapped down here with lorne!
are you okay?
we're fine!
Hey, doc. - Right, right, right.
okay, lorne's got a broken leg!
all right, mckay, stay put.
we've got combat engineers here.
we're going to dig you out.
well, hurry up!
we'll work as fast as is safe, rodney!
no, no, no, you don't understand.
I just found out that when the self-destruct is initiated, it's automatically programmed to send a subspace burst.
Michael's probably already on his way!
it's doesn't look like they're too far down.
we should be able to get them out inside of an hour.
well, what about the other two?
they're a lot deeper.
well, the daedalus will be here soon, so then we can just beam them out, right?
as long as michael doesn't get here first.
all right, let's get started!
rivers, take a jumper into orbit and keep a lookout for michael's ship.
let me know the second he gets here.
okay
this thing ain't moving.
I wonder what happened to the others.
I don't know.
it happened pretty quick. I doubt that many people made it out.
so stupid.
of course the building was booby trapped.
I should have seen that coming.
Yeah, well, none of us did.
Yeah, but I'm that guy.
you know, like, "the guy."
everyone knew what we were getting into.
we all knew how dangerous it was, so don't beat yourself up about it.
you need to start thinking about how to crawl your way out here.
no way.
I'm serious. You just keep moving up, keep moving the debris.
work your way up.
I'm not leaving you behind, sheppard.
I'm not trying to be a hero here.
it's a selfish thing.
I need you to dig a hole so that the rescuers can come down and get me.
that's the wrong way, chief.
we get this beam off you, we get you free, we dig ourselves out together.
deal?
you ain't going to listen to me one way or the other, are you?
great. Deal.
excellent.
this is all very good.
your son should be making an appearance any day now.
I thought that would make you happy.
I can't imagine carrying a child inside of you is very comfortable.
I will not harm him.
why can't you just accept that?
because I know you.
all these worlds, filled with people, busying themselves with their pathetic lives.
they come and they go.
they live and they die, and the galaxy is no better for it.
but your son...
your son will be an instrument of change.
he will be remembered for the ages.
and what of his mother?
you speak often of his future, but never of mine. Why is that?
I had hoped that you would...
I had hoped that you would understand-- - it's time.
very well.
remove the restraints, and post a guard outside this door.
I must escape before our child is born.
he will kill me once I am of no use to him.
I can't.
kanaan, why?
it is too dangerous. - For who?
he will kill us.
kill us all.
Yes, he will, whether you help me or not.
you are disposable to him. Can you not see that?
listen to me.
please...
please!
come over here.
I'm fine. It's just A...just a couple scrapes.
wow, rodney mckay refusing medical help.
now I really know there's something wrong.
seriously, I'm okay.
just, you should look after lorne.
any survivors?
we found two other lifesigns, but they're buried under a lot more debris than you were, so it's going to take a little longer.
we've got people working on it.
know who it is?
not yet.
Rodney, did you find teyla?
no.
no, but I think sheppard was right.
he was going to bring her here. We just-- we came too soon.
Colonel carter.
go ahead.
ma'am, a wraith cruiser just came out of hyperspace.
Michael's here.
multiple lifesigns.
it must be the atlantians...
they're combing the debris, but they must know it's too dangerous to stay here.
they're searching for survivors.
this might not be a total loss after all.
everyone fall back to your jumpers!
we've got incoming!
good shot.
all right, let's fall back to our jumpers.
we've still got men trapped down here.
they're going to have to wait.
we're no good to them out in the open like this.
let's go! Fall back!
cloak the ship.
got it.
we're getting a reading. The gate's been activated.
it's classic wraith battle technique.
they dial the gate, lock everyone out, make sure they can't escape.
well, it's a good one. - Yeah, well, they're not idiots...
we've got more darts on the way, and they've already got troops on the debris field.
they must know we've got people down there.
how many jumpers do we have?
three, including this one.
I'm reading over 20 darts.
but they can't see us, though, right?
well, not right now, but we can't fire while we're cloaked.
it's going to take them time to dig them out, the same as us.
we wait for the daedalus. Rodney, take us into orbit.
darts reporting nimal resistance.
they've already started searching the debris.
we must work fast.
I need them alive.
there it is.
is that michael's cruiser?
well, it looks like it.
does that mean that teyla's on that ship?
it's possible.
well, that's great, though, right?
when the daedalus shows up, we can just beam her up too, no?
it's not as easy as that.
chances are michael's already removed her transmitter, and even if he hasn't, wraith cruisers surround themselves with an electromagnetic jamming field
no beaming in, no beaming out.
we're so close.
come on, one more try.
I'm feeling pretty weak, buddy.
you're not quitting on me yet, are you?
no.
I was thinking about it.
that wasn't part of our deal.
you keep adding things to this "deal" of ours.
right.
ready?
you need to get out of here.
would you leave me if I was stuck under there?
Yes.
you hear that?
what?
it sounds like digging.
Yeah, I hear it.
I hear it.
hey we're down here!
we're coming for you! Just stay calm!
and you were going to quit.
status?
reading another ship in orbit.
it's a wraith cruiser.
shields up. Ready forward beam weapons.
sir, I'm receiving a coded transmission from colonel carter.
Sam, what's going on?
long story short, that's michael's cruiser, and he likely has teyla on board.
so I can't blow him out of the sky?
no, I'm afraid not.
we're taking fire, sir. Shields are holding.
they managed to get their shields up before we hit them.
that's unfortunate.
transfer power to the hyperdrive.
what about the darts?
acceptable losses.
he's running.
not if I can help it.
target his hyperdrive.
Yes, sir.
we've lost hyperdrive.
I guess we're fighting after all.
shields are down to 80%.
Daedalus, we still have two people on the planet.
it is just a matter of time before the hybrids reach them.
can you scan for transmitter signals?
stay calm. We're almost there.
I'm going to stop making fun of combat engineers as of today.
I promise.
is harris up there with you?
Yes, he's here. Don't worry, we'll have you out soon.
I thought harris was on leave until next month.
if we get out of here, beer's on me, boys.
what do you like, duff beer or oprah ale?
well, they don't watch the simpsons or drink beer.
Michael's hybrids?
I bet he was tipped off when the building blew.
I told you, you should have gotten out of here.
Yeah, whatever.
I can't reach my gun.
here.
all right, how you want to play this?
shoot till we can't shoot anymore.
all right.
it's been a pleasure.
same.
we got 'em.
it's colonel sheppard and ronon.
can you beam them up?
we'd have to drop our shields. I kind of think that would be a bad idea right now.
look, if michael gets his hands on them, he'll kill them.
we don't have a choice.
all right, get ready to drop the shields.
as soon as they're down, beam ronon and sheppard directly to the infirmary.
Yes, sir.
Sam, you might as well bring your jumpers onboard at the same time.
understood. We're in position.
all right. Do it.
we've go them! Jumpers are in the bay.
shields up!
enemy vessel has raised shields again, but we scored several direct hits.
keep firing!
how are we doing?
not so good.
we've lost sub-light, hyperdrive, and asgard weapons.
life support's down to 50%.
what about the shields?
well, they're holding for now, but we're basically dead in the water.
don't touch me.
we thought we'd lost you there.
Yeah, well, for a second, I thought we'd lost me.
it's going to be okay, though, right?
yeah...
you need some serious work, but you should, you know, live to fight another day and all that.
so what's going on?
I guess michael showed up before the daedalus...
Yeah, we had to lower the shields to beam you up here.
sorry about that.
well, I'm sure mckay and colonel carter will be able to fix it.
McKay's alive?
Yeah.
Yeah, he and lorne were the only two to make it out of the rubble.
patch me up. I need to get back out there.
what? No, no, no.
look, you will be fine, but you're far from it now.
you've lost a lot of blood.
you need surgery and a transfusion. I mean, this can't wait.
look, doc, michael's here.
that means teyla's probably on the ship.
I'm too close to sit here and do nothing.
you're not going to be sitting around doing nothing. You're going to be lying here in surgery.
there's got to be, like-- there's got to be a quick fix.
no. - I need a few hours.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I have had the chance to rescue a teammate before, and it slipped though my hands.
I am not letting that happen again.
nice one.
of course.
life support's still not working at full power, but at least we won't freeze to death.
well, I've almost got sublight back online, but the way these guys are taxing our shields, we won't have any power to spare anyway.
we need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.
Yeah, with what?
we could launch a 302 attack.
that's what I was thinking.
Colonel.
Dr. Keller said you were out of commission.
she... revised her diagnosis.
look, we may have an idea.
maybe a way to get teyla back.
we need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.
easiest way for us to do that right now is to launch an attack with 302s.
I wouldn't exactly call that easy. They'll just send out darts to intercept them.
that's what we're counting on.
in order to launch the darts, they'll have to open the bay doors.
if we have a cloaked jumper in place, a small team should be able to sneak onto the cruiser undetected...
find teyla, bust her out, and blast our way home.
as a rule, I like to keep daring rescues down to one a day.
look, shields are already down to 20%.
it's just a matter of time before they fail completely.
she's over there, steven, counting on us.
I won't take no for an answer.
all right, take a cloaked jumper. Radio us when you're in position.
John, what really happened in the infirmary?
nothing.
so you're telling me if I go down there right now and talk to jennifer, she'll tell me that you're fit for duty.
just trying to do the job.
so am I, and part of my job is determining whether or not you're going to be a liability on this mission.
Colonel
I have more respect for you than any commanding officer I've ever had, but
I'm getting on that jumper, end of story.
I'll surrender for court-martial when I'm done.
you know, ronon and I could probably handle this.
maybe you should stay with the jumper.
or not.
Daedalus, we're in position.
confirmed.
launch 302s.
302s are approaching.
cue the darts.
it's closing.
I see that.
it's closing quickly. - I got it.
Daedalus, we're in.
it worked.
cruiser just lost main weapons.
let's hope that sheppard has the same luck.
all right, this won't take more than a couple of seconds.
that's... troubling.
what?
Michael's a lot further ahead with his repairs than I would have thought.
the hyperdrive is almost back on-line.
we've got to make this quick.
what do you mean, "quick"?
well, like, 15 minutes is not a lot of time.
no, that's not a lot of time, so why don't you tell us where teyla is already.
righ right, right, right.
got it. Okay.
follow me.
or you.
we're going to get you out of here!
not a moment too soon.
we got to get you back to the jumper.
you okay?
it's my baby.
what? Is something wrong?
no
I've been having contractions for over an hour now.
they're very close.
my baby's coming.
I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.
I'd carry her, buddy, but I'm not really up to it.
Yeah, okay. You ready?
I can walk.
I just need a moment.
uh, say, friends, we have a small issue here.
Oh, what now?
looks like michael's got his hyperdrive back on-line.
it's powering up.
can you shut it down? - Not from this little thing.
the drive room is down the corridor.
you slap a c4 charge on that thing, it should certainly shut it down.
where?
here. I have a map.
all right.
Ronon, you're with me.
I'll be right back.
everything's going to be fine.
you take care of her.
so, how you doing?
the pain is very great.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I had a kidney stone once.
incredibly painful.
same kind of thing, from what I'm told, so I hear you.
actually, my cat and I had one at the same time.
we were not fun to be around. He got his 'cause he was eating too much dry cat food.
I got mine 'cause I wasn't drinking enough liquids.
that's why you always see me hydrating. I have no desire to experience that kind of pain again.
Oh, it's just-- - fascinating story. Thank you.
Yeah, it's no problem.
okay, just-- just breathe, okay?
what are you doing?
it's supposed to help with-- look, I don't know what I'm doing.
what do you need me to do?
okay, there, there. There they are. There, there.
the baby is coming.
just hang on. We'll get you to the infirmary on the daedalus, and keller can...pull it out.
the baby is coming now.
it's almost powered up.
give me your c4.
here, give it to me.
I got it.
give it to me. You don't have to do everything.
all right, you ready?
let's go.
all right.
let's hope we're far enough away.
Yeah, we'll see.
fire in the hole.
what happened?
the hyperdrive just exploded.
no, that's impossible.
main power is out across much of the ship.
an accidental overload?
it doesn't appear that way.
how did they do that?
I will look into it.
they're onboard.
how did they get onboard?
well, can't you just hold it in?
no, rodney!
this doesn't happen this quick. No one has babies this quick.
my water broke quite a while ago.
I've been trying to
I can see its head!
that's good. That's a good thing, rodney.
Yeah, but am I supposed to touch it? Am I allowed to touch you down there? I don't know what to do!
Rodney, calmown.
I need you to be calm.
but I'm not an docter. I've never been an docter.
people have been having babies for thousands of years, most of them without doctors.
Yeah, but before doctors, the infant mortality rate was incredibly high.
it was only like one in three, I think.
look, a doctor is a very important part of this process.
trust me.
there are no doctors around.
you have to do this!
we don't have a choice.
okay, okay.
now, you need to catch him.
catch him?
Yes. You need to catch him when I push him out.
Oh, god.
okay, well just...
underhand him, all right? I've never been good at baseball.
please.
okay, I can do this.
all righ look, I may have panicked a little back there, but we're going to do this.
I am great with kids.
the little ones, the son that don't talk back.
here he comes.
OK, almost there. Almost there.
I caught him!
I caught him.
he is a boy.
watch his head...
right, right.
okay, so, cute.
OK, look at him.
do I get to cut the cord?
I get to cut the cord, then, right?
okay, there you go.
Yeah, okay.
so... okay.
I'd like to introduce you to your son.
wow...
I caught it!
it didn't hit the floor or anything.
he did a wonderful job.
that's good...
you did good, rodney.
all right, we-- we've got to get you out of here.
Ronon, you're going to need to help me.
why isn't it de-cloaking?
let me see. Did you break it?
I don't know.
we parked the jumper right here. - Yes
someone stole the jumper?
this is not good...
I told you, you should have stayed here.
how the hell are we supposed to get off the ship now?
I just delivered a baby. That's not enough for today?
don't they have escape pods or things like that on a cruiser?
no, they
wait, I know.
I need to get back to a data terminal.
a lot of their internal power's down. Maybe I can short out the jamming code. We can get the daedalus to beam us out.
great, lead the way.
don't shoot!
put me down.
it's all right, john.
this is kanaan.
he is the father.
this is our chance.
these are the friends I told you of.
they can help you get back to your old self, but first, you have to help us.
we must get off this ship.
do you know a way?
Yes.
follow me.
no offense, teyla, but I don't trust this guy.
he was trying to save me before.
I trust him.
give me your weapon.
what's your plan?
sir...
we've got a dart trying to hail us.
what?
let me hear it.
this is colonel john sheppard, authentication code
Daedalus, please come in.
authenticated. Colonel, what the hell happened to your jumper?
I got turned around in the parking garage.
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart.
I've got the team beamed into a storage device.
do you have teyla? - Yes, and the baby.
you beamed a baby into wraith storage?
no.
I got him right here, so feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.
copy that.
major marks, please make that ship go away.
Yes, sir.
Colonel sheppard, why don't you head down to the planet, beam your crew out, and land that dart?
I'm pretty sure you can dial up that stargate now.
copy that.
Hey, what's with the bags?
what's with the flowers?
going to see teyla. You probably heard, uh, I delivered her baby.
I did, and they tell me she's going to name him rodney.
Yes! Really?
no. Not really.
Oh, that's funny.
where are you going?
back to earth.
what? Why?
Oh, they've caught the last ba'al clone.
the tok'ra are going to extract the symbiote. They want sg-1 to put in an appearance.
okay.
Plus, the I. O.A. want to do an "exhaustive" review of my first year in command, so, you know, that can't be good.
are you crazy? They probably want to give you a medal. You had a great year.
I know my opinion doesn't mean much to those folks, but
I think you've done an excellent job.
I'm glad you took the post.
Thanks, rodney. That means a lot.
tell sheppard the court-martial will have to wait.
sure. See you soon.
hope so.
how long will the surgery take?
doc says a few hours, but I'll be off my feet for a week or so.
I cannot believe you attempted to mount a rescue in your condition.
attempt?
last time I checked, I succeeded.
how's the kid?
Dr. Keller says he's perfectly healthy.
I say he's perfectly everything.
that's great.
I want to thank you.
there's no need.
I never gave up hope, because I knew...
I knew that you would come for me, john.
you would have done the same for me.
Yes.
all right.
you ready, colonel?
ready?
from my understanding, I'm not doing anything.
Yeah, that's right.
you just have to lie still and let me play with your insides.
sorry.
um, let's go.
what are you going to name the kid?
well, if it's all right with you, I was thinking of torren john, after my father, and after you.
Really?
McKay's going to hate that.
I would be very honored.
very well.
Colonel carter.
Mr. Woolsey, how are you?
very well. Thank you for asking.
so is this whole evaluation process going to take very long?
I mean, there's a lot of work to be done on atlantis, and I'm kind of anxious to get back.
I'm sure you are.
however, the I. O.A. Has decided that perhaps someone with a different skill set would be more suited to lead the atlantis expedition now.
excuse me?
I'm here to inform you that, effective immediately, you are being removed from command.
who's replacing me?
as a matter of fact...
I am.
the weekly injection you gave me, that must have been some kind of drug to keep my cells from deteriorating.
listen, we're going to keep working till we find a cure for this thing.
whoa...
jackpot.
it's a booby trap. We got to get out of here now!
have the combat engineers gear up, and have dr. Keller ready her away team.
listen...
it's michael's database.
there's a large chunk of it, maybe the whole thing.
we'd have him on the run. He'd be finished.
effective immediately, you are being removed from command.
Who-Who's replacing me?
I am.
good afternoon, dr. Keller.
how's my newest patient?
today, he's decided that he will only sleep as long as I hold him and keep moving.
I've already walked half the city and back again.
my parents used to put me in the car.
my dad would have to drive around and around and around the block 00 in the morning.
that would be lovely. At least I'd be sitting down.
I wanted to thank you.
for what?
I saw Kanaan today.
how's he doing?
much better.
he is himself once again, in every way.
in fact, I'm going to request that he and many of the others be allowed to return to the city, as soon as Mr. Woolsey arrives in the daedalus.
I still can't believe sam's not coming back.
it is difficult.
well, anyway, it wasn't me that cured kanaan and the other hybrids. It was dr. Beckett's retrovirus, and you could thank him in person if I could just get my head around all this wraith medical data.
we know he was giving Carson a serum to keep his internal organs from deteriorating, and I think I might have found the formula, I just need to be sure.
well, at least we know he's safe for the moment.
technically, yeah.
I just hate the thought of him being stuck in that box.
you know Rodney goes to visit him?
he stands in front of the stasis pod and tells him all the latest news.
Really?
I walked in on him once by accident, and he pretended like he was checking the system or something.
he surprises me sometimes.
well, this is me once again being recalled to duty.
have a nice walk.
don't worry, Jennifer. I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.
sir, daedalus just dropped out of hyperspace.
we're receiving a signal.
he's coming down.
Mr. Woolsey, welcome back.
thank you, colonel.
well, then...
I think I'll start by going over copies of all your latest reports.
yours as well, doctor.
what, right now?
I've been out of touch on the daedalus for three weeks.
I'd like to be brought up to speed as quickly as possible.
we can have a full briefing in the morning.
please have the rest of my things sent directly to my quarters.
Yes, sir.
nice speech.
very inspiring.
all right, let's do one more series, see if we can get the results to normalize a little.
doctor, you're still here.
Oh, yeah, I fell asleep at my desk.
well, if you don't mind me saying,
I think you're pushing yourself a little hard.
you should take it easy.
are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
okay, 'night.
night.
the Seed did you get any sleep last night?
do I really look that bad?
no, no, of course not. That's not what I meant.
uh, it's really... it's a lovely...
Thanks.
wow, new table, huh?
a 12-foot-long mahogany conference table, hmm...
I don't get it.
I thought colonel carter was doing a good job.
I agree.
we defeated the replicators, we thwarted Michael's plans, the Wraith are in a state of disarray.
all this happened while she was leader of Atlantis.
that's the problem.
I don't understand.
she's a victim of her own success.
now that the threat level is down, the IOA's going to jump at the chance to put a civilian back in command.
well, it's not just that. I mean, Sam didn't exactly stick to protocol.
neither did Weir.
right, so for four years, they've been waiting to get someone in there who'll finally do things their way.
I still don't get it.
Colonel, when you were in the future, and you learned all those things that were going to happen, wasn't this one of them, Woolsey taking over?
well, the circumstances were different.
still, it is a little unsettling.
I mean, maybe it's harder to change the course of events than we thought.
well, I wouldn't worry about it.
I mean, the fact that Sheppard's here makes all the difference, right?
woolsey wasn't the weirdest thing about that timeline.
what do you mean?
never mind.
well,
I see everyone's here.
let's get started.
first of all, I'd like to congratulate all of you on the success you've had dismantling what's left of Michael's organization.
except one thing. We haven't found him yet.
well, he was on the cruiser you destroyed in orbit around .
there's a chance he may have made it off the ship.
right, you're referring to this statement given by one of Michael's ex-mercenaries, claiming to have seen him alive recently.
that's what he said.
this is one unsubstantiated report from a highly unreliable source.
well, someone stole our jumper off that ship.
I thought you needed ancient DNA to pilot one of those.
not necessarily. We developed a gene therapy that works some of the time.
he is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
even if I knew for a fact he were still alive, I still wouldn't authorize it, unless you have some new, credible evidence as to his whereabouts.
do you?
no.
then, for the time being,
I shall consider the matter closed.
as to these prisoner hybrids. I understand they're being held in a camp on the mainland?
that's right.
doctor?
right, uh...
well, um, we've had some success using a slightly modified version of the original retrovirus that created Michael in the first place.
it weeds out the Wraith DNA, and allows them to resume their original human form, over time.
without any lasting ill effects?
none that we've detected so far.
many have already completed the treatment. They're wondering when they might be released.
let's not get ahead of ourselves.
these people are victims, Mr. Woolsey.
no.
we'll keep them there until I'm satisfied that they can be trusted.
now, regarding the situation with our friend in the stasis pod.
you seem to have been giving a significant amount of attention to this lately.
well, once we got our hands on Michael's medical research,
and have you found one?
maybe.
we found a serum that, in lab tests at least, seems to be capable of stabilizing the clone cells.
so, what's the problem?
Carson was near death when we put him in that chamber.
I don't want to take him out until I know for sure, but lab tests can only do so much.
but that problem's never going to go away, is it?
if you've reached the limit of what your research can tell you, then you need to make a decision.
either proceed, or put the matter aside and get back to your regular duty.
right?
you sure about this?
no, but we're never going to be sure unless we give it a shot.
if we don't take a chance now, he could be in there forever.
all right, then.
get him on the gurney.
careful...
okay.
now what?
now we take him to the infirmary and watch for signs for more cellular degradation.
we should know soon enough.
hey there.
fine.
what happened?
well, what do you think?
it's nice to see you again, Carson.
Yeah, what's up, doctor? It's been a while.
Aye.
how long was I in there?
two months, give or take.
did I miss anything?
you know, just the usual.
well, I've got good news.
at the moment, you're showing no signs of cellular degradation.
you were able to recreate the treatment.
that's right.
I'll let them tell you all about it.
Hey, doctor... um, nice work.
well, it's not a permanent solution.
it's good enough for now.
go get some rest.
Yeah, I think that might be a good idea.
there you are.
gorgeous, isn't it?
I suppose so.
you know, I really did miss this place.
Yeah, well, don't get used to it.
what's that supposed to mean?
look, I just found out they're sending you back to earth.
there's a scheduled dial-out this afternoon.
Oh, well, I suppose it's to be expected.
I mean, even with these injections,
I imagine it'd still be months before I'm in any sort of decent physical condition.
Rodney, this is teyla, come in, please.
go ahead.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I need your help.
what is it?
it's dr. Keller. She was supposed join me for breakfast this morning but did not show up.
so maybe she's sleeping in.
I assumed as much as well, and decided not to disturb her. However, that was four hours ago.
she's now late for her shift, and she's not responding to radio calls.
what do you want me to do about it?
override the door controls.
fine, but if she's just in there sleeping, or naked or something, you guys are taking the blame.
Oh, for god's sake, Rodney, hurry up.
Jennifer, are you all right?
she must be unconscious.
pupils dilated.
Carson, step away from the bed.
what?
step away now!
what is it?
dear lord.
Colonel sheppard, this is Teyla.
go ahead.
John, we have a problem.
what the hell's going on?
we're not sure. This is how we found her.
it must've happened last night.
I've seen something like this before.
one of michael's labs.
he was conducting some kind of experiment.
well, we've got to get it off of her.
I'm not so certain that's such a good idea.
from what I can tell, the tendrils are attached to her and the bedframe.
if we just start ripping them off, we could cause her serious injury.
well, we can't just leave her like this.
we need to get her into an isolation chamber, and take the whole bed as well.
that way we can run a full examination and see what we're dealing with here.
these things are actually growing out of her body?
that's what it looks like.
is she conscious?
Beckett says her brain activity is consistent with somebody in a coma.
he was the first one there. He says he's seen something like this before.
while he was a prisoner.
he was forced to work for Michael for two years. Nobody knows this stuff better than he does.
I'm going to try to cut some of the thinner strands.
scalpel.
thank you.
there we go.
nurse?
no change.
get that analyzed right away.
doctor, blood pressure's dropping. Pulse as well.
that's what I was afraid of. She's crashing.
administer five milligrams of atropine.
my god...
come on...
there she is.
I'm sorry, I don't dare make another incision.
so much for cutting her loose.
Dr. Beckett, I'd like a word.
don't worry, I'll get her out. Once I get back to the lab
doctor, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but our earth dial-out is in one hour.
I'll take a pass on this one, if you don't mind.
if it wasn't for dr. Keller,
I'd still be locked in that stasis chamber, possibly forever.
Dr. Keller's own report is abundantly clear.
while your condition has stabilized, you've still suffered severe damage to your internal organs.
you need to be in a hospital bed yourself, not running a medical investigation.
I'll be fine.
at the first sign of trouble, I'll step aside, I promise.
you're convinced this has something to do with Michael?
well, it's not a case of the hives, is it?
how's she doing?
vitals have stabilized, still showing minimal brain function.
we did manage to get blood and tissue samples.
all right, then we've got some work to do.
you're not sending him back, huh?
he is the closest thing to an expert we have.
it's not exactly by the book.
don't get used to it.
how's it coming?
slowly, but I did find something in Gennifer's blood sample.
what?
easy.
it's some kind of alien pathogen, so far unidentified.
I'm checking it against the database.
is it possible she's turning into a hybrid?
no, I don't think so.
I've seen several variations of the conversion process, but never anything like this.
well, it's got to be something to do with Michael.
I mean, she hasn't been off world since she helped rescue us from that lab.
that's what I was thinking.
of course, if that's where she came in contact with the pathogen...
you think the rest of us may have been exposed as well.
well, aye, it's a possibility.
I'll need blood samples from everyone who was on that planet, including you.
Oh, great.
doctor...
yes?
Yes.
she's awake.
thank you. Right.
Oh, my god...
Rodney, what's happening to me?
we're not entirely sure.
it looks like some kind of a cocoon.
does it hurt?
I can't feel anything. I can't move.
okay, look...
don't you worry, okay? We're going to get you out.
who else is here?
what do you mean? There's no one.
I don't want to go to sleep. I'm afraid I won't wake up.
it's not my fault.
of course it's not. It's an alien organism.
what?
Carson found it in your blood sample.
he's going to figure out what it is, and then we're going to figure out how to kill it.
my hand.
what about it?
that's where it started.
I saw it a few nights ago.
so why didn't you say anything?
I was going to run a scan. I don't...
I don't know.
it doesn't matter, okay? We're going to fix this.
I promise.
it appears to be affecting her mind.
aye, she claims to be hearing voices, like there's someone else in the room with her.
how fast is it growing?
currently, it's doubling its mass every couple of hours.
thank you.
this isn't just about dr. Keller anymore.
I need to know if this thing is going to be a threat to the base.
I'd say that's a definite yes.
what do you mean?
Colonel sheppard, Ronon, Rodney, everyone who was on m2s 445, they all tested positive.
whatever this is, they've all got it.
right now we're working under the assumption that this alien pathogen was present somewhere in that lab, possibly as part of one of Michael's experiments.
when the building was destroyed, it was released.
we've been back for a month now.
it was going to spread to the general population, it would've already happened.
I know.
Dr. Beckett is now fairly confident that it's not contagious.
right, then, why confine us to our quarters?
you've seen what's happening to dr. Keller.
Yeah, but it's not happening to me. - Not yet.
there could be any number of random physiological reasons why it's starting with dr. Keller, but that's no guarantee that it's not going to happen to the rest of you.
it could be a matter of days, it could be a matter of hours.
even colonel carter's been quarantined back at stargate command.
look, I know it's hard for you to stay on the sidelines, colonel, but it's the right call.
in the meantime, what are we going to do about keller?
we're still assessing the situation.
we still don't know how the pathogen causes the physiological changes, but we've managed to complete our analysis of the sample I extracted.
essentially it's a biopolymer, similar to a polysaccharide, but with organo-metallic compounds mixed in.
for the uninitiated, please, doctor.
it's like the material an insect or a crustacean uses to form its shell.
at first, it's soft and pliable, and then it becomes tough and leathery, and eventually it hardens into an incredible density, resistant to heat, pressure, and even radiation. Yes, it's like the hull of a ship.
Aye.
what are you saying?
look, we always knew that the wraith ships were organic in design, right, that they were essentially grown instead of constructed.
we've just never witnessed it before.
are you telling me that a hive ship is growing inside that isolation room?
actually, it's no longer just inside the isolation room.
it doesn't register on our life-signs detector, but once we knew what we were looking for, we calibrated our internal sensors to pick it up.
it has penetrated the walls and the floors, consuming and converting the material as it goes.
how far has it spread?
it's gone down... three levels already, and it has attached itself to the electrical system.
it's siphoning off power as it goes.
this seems to have accelerated its growth significantly.
how do we stop it?
that's the part we're still trying to figure out.
we could cut off the power. That should slow it down quite a bit.
what's happening?
Marie, what's going on?
doctor, we've been ordered to evacuate the building.
I'm sorry.
they just left her there?
I don't think they had much of a choice.
Carson is searching Michael's database to see if there is anything that can help us.
I suppose it was Zelenka's idea to shut off the power?
I don't know. Why?
this is ridiculous.
they got us stuck in our quarters while the new guy takes advice from the b team?
what is it, Rodney?
they are assuming that it tapped into the electric grid by randomly spreading out through the walls and floors.
what if it actually grows towards electromagnetic fields, like a plant growing toward the sun?
it's going to head directly for the next available power source.
there.
one of the city's main power conduits runs beneath the building.
so shut the power down in that section as well.
no, we already did, right, but this runs directly into the ZPM.
it's like an express lane.
we've already shut off the rest of the traffic, but this one keeps moving along.
the only way to stop it would be to pull the ZPM and shut off power to the entire city.
I had no idea you were so familiar with the power distribution grid.
I'm not. I spoke to Rodney.
is there a problem?
the pathogen seems to have a psychological effect on the host.
at the very least, we know it can affect their judgment, possibly well before any physical symptoms appear.
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.
if it reaches the conduit, it will have access to virtually unlimited power.
and what would happen?
the growth would increase exponentially.
and since we've shut this section down, we have no sensors in the area, so the only way to know how far it's penetrated is to do a visual inspection.
all right, assemble a team.
I need some answers, doctor.
how do we kill this thing?
well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting dr. Keller but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.
what would?
at this time, Mr. Woolsey, I have no idea.
so the main conduit runs behind this wall here.
here, we can access it through this panel.
sergeant, take your men, split up, and search the surrounding corridors.
look for anything that seems unusual.
all right?
okay.
right, I'll go this way.
stay in radio contact.
I think I have something.
looks like Rodney was right.
Oh my god.
what is it?
looks like it's attached itself to the power conduit.
I'm coming to you.
I'm going to see if I can determine how much power it's draining.
let's go, let's go.
come on.
are you all right?
I think so.
I had no idea it could move like that. - Nor did I.
this is much worse than we thought.
looks like it's just a minor concussion. He should be fine.
so it wasn't bad enough that this thing was slowly taking over the base.
now it's attacking people?
we need to put a stop to this, now.
it won't be easy.
it's already siphoned off a massive amount of power.
we should pull the ZPM.
that might not be enough.
we could sit here in the dark for weeks while it just keeps on growing.
we need to get Gennifer out of there.
I want to save dr. Keller as much as anyone else, but we have additional concerns now.
why did it attack Radek?
because it perceived him as a threat and took action.
that indicates intelligence, but as far as we know, it has no brain of its own.
so you're saying it's using her.
I'm saying it needs her, to plan, to coordinate, to identify threats and deal with them.
that could explain why she was hearing voices.
the organism takes over a portion of the brain, and sets up a separate consciousness.
like multiple personalities.
otherwise, why have a human host at all?
so if we separate her from the main body...
I'd wager the rest of it becomes as lifeless as a dead tree trunk.
now, this is the virus I was telling you about.
it's called a phage, and it should, at least theoretically, be able to attack and eliminate the pathogen that's inside Gennifer's bloodstream, and if I'm right about this, it should sever the connection.
what's the catch?
well, it's never been tested.
we turned the power back on briefly to get a look inside the building.
this is the ground floor, five floors below the isolation room.
as you can see, access is almost completely choked off, but for this to work, I need someone to step right up to dr. Keller's bed and inject her.
well, we can use the transporter to get them close, but you'd still have to run a gauntlet of over 50 meters.
and after what happened to dr. Zelenka...
well, you understand my dilemma.
Yeah.
what?
if dr. Keller really is the key to this thing, there is an easier way.
we'd only need a couple of well-aimed shots at the isolation room.
wait a second, you're talking about drones?
you're going to fire drones at one of our own people?
I didn't come to Atlantis with the intention of killing one of my senior staff inside of a week, but my only other option is to risk someone else's life on a solution...
that hasn't even been tested yet.
not exactly by the book.
so test it.
I've got the same bug.
I'll take a shot right now.
no, no, no...
I'll do it.
restraints, huh?
I'm sorry, but I'm anticipating a severe reaction.
Oh, great.
now, you're absolutely sure about this?
remember, the formula comes from Michael, so as far all we know, it could turn me into a bug?
been there, done that.
no, actually, I was going to say it could kill you.
just... give me the shot.
okay.
now, it should take a few minutes to kick in, so just...
try to relax. - Oh, okay, I'll just...
I'll relax.
Carson, is it true that lorne and some of the others are beginning to show symptoms?
aye, I'm afraid so.
Oh, god...
Why?
have you noticed something yourself?
well, my palms are very sweaty, and my mouth is very dry, I'm having heart palpitations.
okay, so, nothing out of the ordinary, then?
how do you feel?
I don't feel anything.
I don't even think that...
Hey, doc...
I think these restraints were a good idea.
it's working.
what's our status?
well, the infirmary, and a few other essential systems have been switched to emergency generators.
we're ready.
all right, pull the plug.
for god's sake, Carson, how long's this going to go on for?
I'm sorry, Rodney, I have no idea.
doc...
his heart stopped. Bag him.
get a crash cart in here!
prepare to intubate.
come on.
he's back.
how'd I do?
are you sure it worked?
well, the blood screen came up negative.
as far as I can tell, the alien pathogen has been eliminated.
well done.
now we just need someone to go to the isolation room.
I'll do it-- - I'll do it.
I assume no special medical skill is required to administer the drug.
well, no, not really. It's just a simple injection.
well, then, given your condition, I wouldn't make you my first choice.
that's why I said I'd do it.
he doesn't trust us, because we're still infected.
actually, that might not be a bad thing.
when colonel Sheppard was infected with iratus bug DNA, he was able to walk right into that nest without being attacked.
you think someone infected with the pathogen would be more likely to get through?
well, it's possible.
all right, I'm in.
cut power to the transporter.
how does it look?
not so good.
the stuff's everywhere.
is it reacting to your presence in any way?
not really.
all right, just be careful.
what happened?
it worked. They just sent Ronon to give her the shot.
when?
he just got there. Look, I'm tapped into the intercom.
Ronon, what's your status?
well, it's getting harder to move. There's too much of it.
just... try not to make any sudden moves, or threatening gestures.
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
all right, that's it.
I don't think I can go any further.
the corridor is completely blocked.
all right, so what do you want me to do?
screw it, I'm going to make a hole. - Ronon, wait!
the only reason you made it this far is because it senses the pathogen in your bloodstream.
it thinks you're a friend.
if you start shooting-- - does anyone have any better ideas?
what are you doing?
if I'm right, this is about to go very, very wrong.
you can't.
we're quarantined-- - I'm cured, remember?
there's no other way through.
once you start shooting, you'll have to move quickly.
thanks for the advice.
Ronon, what's your status?
Ronon, come in!
Oh, my god...
what's happening?
we've lost contact.
turn the power back on. Open up a channel to the isolation room.
what? Why?
just do it.
all right, you have a channel.
Dr. Keller, this is colonel sheppard, do you read?
I hear you, colonel, but I'm not dr. Keller anymore.
well, who are you?
I have no designation yet. I'll be given one when I'm complete.
what about Ronon?
you mean the intruder?
he's alive, for the moment.
he's been neutralized.
I can feel his pulse.
it's weak.
it would only take the slightest squeeze.
Yeah, but you don't want to do that because he's one of you, remember?
keep her talking.
where are you going?
I'm going to go finish this.
Jennifer, this is carson.
Dr. Beckett, I already told you, I'm not jennifer keller anymore.
you're the voice she was hearing, the part of her mind that was taking over.
you can't stop me.
I will become as I was meant to be.
Colonel sheppard is powering up a jumper.
get me a secure channel.
Sheppard, what are you doing?
I'm taking a little short-cut.
sorry I didn't have time to fill out the paperwork.
okay, I see it now.
that stuff is growing all over the place.
this may hurt.
Colonel sheppard, report.
Colonel sheppard?
Colonel sheppard, what's your status?
Colonel sheppard...
I've been better.
what happened?
you'd better come get us.
how's Ronon?
he has a bruised larynx.
apparently he won't be able to speak for several days.
I wonder if anyone will notice the difference.
Colonel sheppard?
look who's finally out of isolation.
Oh, it's good to see you, doc.
how you feeling?
it only hurts when I breathe.
I feel really bad.
it looks like my recovery's going to be a lot easier than yours.
that's all right.
I've got two doctors looking after me now.
well, no, I'm afraid not.
I'm scheduled to leave this afternoon.
that is, unless of course there's a major crisis in the next hour or so.
it wouldn't surprise me.
well, listen, you keep yourself out of trouble, and I'll see you real soon.
good luck, Carson.
Thanks, John.
welcome back, dr. Keller, and dr. Beckett...
thank you.
my pleasure, Mr. Woolsey.
before I came down here, I was on a call with my superiors back on earth.
they were going over my preliminary report.
what did you tell them?
the truth.
that in my first three days as commander, I violated at least half a dozen basic security protocols.
that many, huh?
I let beckett run the investigation, in spite of his condition and the fact that he's technically no longer a member of this expedition.
I sent Ronon to deliver the antidote even though he was infected.
I compromised the safety of this base to rescue someone who may well have been beyond our help anyway.
but she wasn't, and we got her out.
and if you had played by the rules, she'd be dead right now.
the IOA would seem to agree with you.
apparently, they're willing to let the matter drop.
so, what's the problem?
the rules are there for a reason, colonel.
if I can't trust them, then...
I'm not sure I can do this job.
welcome to the pegasus galaxy.
Oh yeah!
me, rakai, ara, we're your friends.
you belong with us.
you want to hit a wraith lab?
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
Oh, oh, thank god it's you three.
the wraith worshipers-- they did you.
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
rakai, no! - No weapons.
Rodney, get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
you getting any sleep these days?
not much, I'm afraid.
although things are a little easier now that kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return from the mainland.
how's he liking life in the big city?
well, he's happy to be reunited with torren and I, but he's having difficulty adjusting to life on atlantis.
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.
and you once stunned dr. Gero at your own surprise birthday party.
he spooked me.
Uh-huh.
it's difficult for kanaan.
he has torren and me, of course, but
I still think he feels isolated.
Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends.
you should get him to come by the gym sometime.
we could spar.
thank you. That's very kind of you, but I need him in one piece for the foreseeable future.
Ah, you're no fun.
Hey!
the daedalus confirms the results of your preliminary search.
there's no sign of ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet.
broken Ties
that means he's still alive.
if tyre wanted him dead, we would have found the body.
unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge.
I don't mean to sound overly negative, but from what I've heard, his mind is seriously warped.
and yet he didn't kill me.
it would have been safer for him to leave no witnesses.
so perhaps, despite what the wraith did to him, tyre still possesses his satedan sense of honor.
it didn't stop him from ambushing you.
maybe we can use that satedan sense of honor to help us find ronon.
how do you propose we do that?
we get a satedan to help us.
you happen to have one handy, do you?
Teyla knows where one is.
who?
he is a survivor of the wraith attack on sateda.
ronon and i encountered him on a trade mission to belkan two years ago.
by your description, he isn't exactly the settle-down kind of guy.
what are the chances he's still there?
there's only one way to find out.
Mr. Woolsey, permission to go off-world?
you have a go. - Great.
Oh, and teyla, will you be accompanying colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay?
I only ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty.
of course she'll be returning. Right?
I'm yet to make a decision about my future with the team.
Oh.
okay.
however, I would still like to accompany colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay to belkan.
of course.
Where's teyla?
I left her back on the planet.
don't worry. She's fine.
you know I wouldn't hurt her.
do I?
I accept the fact that you no longer trust me, but I'm hoping that will change in time.
sateda is gone.
we're the last of our kind, ronon.
we're brothers, not enemies.
we're brothers?
so I should just forgive you for setting me up last year?
if you had just listened to reason, things could have been different.
Ara and rakai would still be alive, and we'd all be working together again.
as wraith worshipers and traitors to the memory of sateda?
hell, no.
of course not.
I see that now.
you're blinded by the past, lied to by your so-called friends on atlantis.
but ilst fhaaith in you, old friend.
you just need to open your eyes to the truth.
all right.
just untie me and I'll listen to what you have to say.
would that be before or after you try to beat me unconscious?
I don't know.
you choose.
or I could just surprise you.
I don't doubt it.
what's wrong with you?
I'm not well.
but I've been worse.
you know where we are?
you remember sarif sur, don't you?
Yeah. You almost died on that run.
we botnearly died because you refused to leave me behind.
you risked your life to save me.
today...
I return the favor.
go away.
can't you see I'm trying to sleep?
we need your help.
ronon dex is in trouble.
ronon dex is always in trouble.
well, his life is in danger.
again. What else is new?
what kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?
he was abducted by a fellow satedan, a wraith worshiper by the name of tyre.
you mean former wraith worshiper.
word is the dog disappointed his masters, so they turned him loose.
well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.
not exactly.
so long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing example of what happens to humans who disappoint them.
tyre's a marked man now.
most anyone I know would kill him on sight. It's just a matter of time.
he was once a proud satedan, not unlike yourself.
he was subjected to unimaginable torture.
perhaps he had no choice.
there's always a choice.
he could have chosen death like a true satedan.
any idea where we can find him?
if I knew that, he'd already be dead.
all ght. Tyre's not thinking straight, right?
sure.
so it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up.
and when he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.
probably.
so what do you say, you contact us when you hear something.
we'll deal with tyre and save you the trip.
all right.
to ronon.
look at you.
you can barely walk.
let me get you some help.
I'm beyond your help.
it's the wraith, isn't it?
what did they do to you?
at this point, it's not so much what they did to me as what they aren't doing to me.
giving you life?
Reverse-feeding or whatever the hell it's called?
it's hard to describe.
the sense of euphoria it offers is...
you became addicted to it.
you can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself.
it was a gift, one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to escape us.
Hey, free me, and I'll get you some help.
I promise.
help is already on the way.
for both of us.
what does that mean?
what the hell did u do?
I've saved us.
I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve me.
well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.
Oh, I'm sure you'll try.
but, in the end, you'll come around.
Mr. Woolsey
any news on ronon?
not yet.
I'm sorry.
I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a proven survivor.
he defied the odds for many years as a runner.
Yes, he did.
how can I help you?
I wanted to apologize for not having come to you sooner with a decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.
take whatever time you need.
if necessary,
I can assign someone to fill in for you.
Oh...
Mr. Woolsey, do you have children?
uh, no.
but I did have a yorkie for many years.
it's a small dog.
but my wife got him in the divorce.
I loved that dog.
I never really had the chance to say goodbye.
so, no.
no children.
then, with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this is for me.
for most of my life,
I never imagined the possibility of leaving my people, not even for a moment...
and then circumstances changed.
and after realizing a far more important role on colonel sheppard's team,
I never imagined the day would come when I would have to let it go.
and now here that day is.
five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the milky way, my answer would have been a definite no.
and now...
look at me.
so...
while I can't empathize,
I certainly do sympathize.
believe me, I know
priorities change.
and sometimes they don'T.
Teyla, I'm sure kanaan will support you whatever decision you make.
Yes. Of course he will.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
how does it feel to have your life stolen?
to be pushed so close to the darkness, only to be pulled back from the brink?
from what I understand, it's a magnificent sensation.
to be honest,
I've felt better.
defy me all you want.
your fellow satedans were no different.
like them, you'll eventually submit.
I'll die before I submit.
no.
you won'T.
Hey.
you're up early.
10: 00 A. M.
it is?
Oh, god.
I didn't sleep at all. I was up all night thinking about this ronon situation.
got anything? - Nothing. I tried everything
pacing, snacking, bathing
bathing.
Yeah.
like archimedes.
you mean that greek scientist who had a crush on teyla?
no, like the greek mathematician who came up with the archimedes principle, the physical laws of buoyancy.
according to legend, the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so...
look, the point is that the revelation occurred while he was relaxing.
he was not thinking about the problem.
and the solution, as it turns out, was right in front of him all along.
you think we've overlooked something?
I don't know.
maybe. Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it and I'm drawing a blank, so I could use a fresh perspective.
I'm not taking a bath with you.
let's just go over what we know.
according to solen, tyre's on the run.
and we can assume he's operating alone because if he had backup, they would have been in on the ambush.
right. He's alone, with ronon, on the run.
so where would someone like that go?
well, I can think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect.
where do you want to start?
how about sarif sur?
what?
we just got a message from ronon's buddy, solen.
he hears that tyre and ronon are holed up on a planet called sarif sur.
thank you, archimedes.
major, get your team and gear up.
Yes, sir.
there's just no point in holding on.
you're just putting off the inevitable.
it's better if you just accept it.
you mean better for you, don't you?
the wraith cut you off and this is your way back in, by offering me up as a sacrifice.
no.
you're not the man I risked my life for.
you're a traitor to the memory of our people.
you have no honor.
things are progressing too slowly.
I have other matters to attend to.
we can continue this process back at the lab.
and when will I receive my reward?
your reward?
I brought him here as we agreed.
in exchange, you promised to restore our previous arrangement.
huh. Did I?
you promised!
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint, since your usefulness has come to an end.
we'll get him.
see that you do, colonel.
nothing.
so we were wrong.
it has been known to happen.
Hey, I always said this was a longshot.
Colonel, this is lorne.
we've got something.
I knew it.
over here.
we checked his pulse.
it's barely there. We've got to move him or we lose him.
Where's ronon? - Good question.
his injuries are minor, but both his heartrate and blood pressure are elevated.
he woke up about an hour after you brought him in.
he was delirious, he was sweating, nauseous, trembling.
so I sedated him and ran some tests.
after giving him a drug that blocks opioid receptors,
I noticed a drop in dopamine levels here
a central link in the brain's reward circuit.
right. Meaning?
meaning this type of neurochemical activity is identical to that of reforming substance-users.
he's going through withdrawal.
I need you to save him, doc.
right now, he's our only lead. If he dies, our chances of finding ronon go with him.
of course. But it could be days before he's coherent enough to tell us anything.
John! Why wasn't I informed about the mission to rescue ronon?
we were playing on a hunch. We had to act fast.
I'm going go, um, see if they're still serving lunch.
it's taquito tuesday.
I think I'll join you.
I'm surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without me.
don't put this on me.
you're the one having second thoughts about returning to the team.
I cannot give you the option every time we're going off-world.
this is not an easy decision for me.
you think you're the only one feeling pressure?
I've got woolsey pushing me hard to find a replacement for you.
what did you tell him?
I told him that I wasn't going to do anything until I talked to you.
now, if you want to join the team, great.
I'll call woolsey. I'll make it happen.
but if you want to spend time with your son, I understand. I do. I really do.
you've got to make a decision.
you're finally awake.
the procedure can be very taxing.
you've been unconscious for the better part of a day.
you're wasting your time.
I'll die before I turn.
just like marika and hemi.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
your friends didn't die because they were strong.
they died because they were too weak to withstand the process.
their minds and bodies eventually shut down under the strain.
but you...
you're stronger.
and it is your strength that will prove your undoing.
he broke through his restraints this morning and injured two guards, so I thought it would be best to put him in isolation.
at least this way, if he breaks free again, he won't be an immediate danger to anyone.
how long is it going to take him to go through this?
to be honest, I'm not even sure he will.
please!
you're killing me!
please!
can't you give him something for the pain?
sedatives will make him more comfortable, but they'll also slow down his recovery.
I want this to go as quick as possible. No sedatives.
he's already sleeping?
why does it take so much longer when I try to put him down?
you worry too much.
perhaps he senses your anxiety.
maybe he prefers the comfort of his mother's presence.
well, there may be times when he will have to learn to do without.
does that mean you've decided?
I thought so...
how can I return to the team with the knowledge that every time I step through the gate, there is a chance that I might not come back?
that, given the dangers, there's a possibility that our son will grow up without a mother?
you have a responsibility to him.
but you also have a responsibility to the people of this galaxy.
follow your heart without remorse.
and take comfort in knowing that you'll be doing so to safeguard the future of many, including your son.
just promise me you'll be careful out there.
he's been awake and lucid for about 10 minutes now.
what did he say?
only that he wanted to talk to you.
I know where they've taken ronon.
you can give us a gate address?
better. I'll lead you right into the heart of the facility.
well, you're still recovering.
Dr. Keller told me there were no longer any traces of the wraith enzyme in my system.
that's not the point. - Colonel, please.
let me help you get ronon back.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
no mercy for our enemies.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
and no mercy to your enemies.
our enemies.
no mercy.
he seems rational, says he wants to help us.
I say we trust him only as much as we have to.
use his intel, but he stays here, under guard.
if you want to hit that wraith facility, we'll need all the help we can get, and apparently he knows that place inside and out.
Yes, and is thus in the perfect position to lead you right into a trap.
all right, look, I think, as much as he'd like us to believe it, this is not about regaining some lost honor, or some satedan revenge thing.
pure and simple-- this is about a desperate guy who's willing to do anything to help his buddy.
and how can you be so certain of that, colonel?
because I've been there.
now, we have a chance to get ronon, and I'm going to take it, and you're going to need to trust me on this.
all right.
major lorne's team will be accompanying you.
what is it? What's happening?
we know where ronon is.
I'm coming with you.
gear up.
uh, teyla, this is exactly the kind of decision we were
I was about to meet kanaan in the cafeteria.
would you please explain to him the situation?
it's all right.
please.
all right.
well, well, well, who have we here?
cafeteria.
cafeteria.
this way.
what is this place?
you were looking for a target area that would maximize the effects of your explosives.
well, this is it, the facility's power relay cham R.
hide your charges to avoid discovery.
let's go.
I assume you have a means to remote-detonate from a safe distance?
well, just flip...
click.
this way.
it's about time.
what's going on, buddy?
we were beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up.
you're at a disadvantage.
you could attempt an escape, but you'll have to sacrifice your friend's life to do so.
Ronon, get out of the way.
I can't do that.
Ronon, step aside.
his life wouldn't be the only one forfeit.
lower your weapons.
take them away.
Ronon, what's happening here?
I assume this is a prize worthy of reward?
welcome back.
well, you know, on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go back to atlantis and hear woolsey say "I told you so.
we're going to get out of here.
Oh, sure, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right?
I mean, get past all of the armed wraith that are guarding the facility and free lorne and his team from wherever they're being held, get back to the jumper, which is probably being disassembled as we speak, and of course we've got to rescue ronon who, I don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself.
we're going to get ronon and we're going to go back to atlantis.
and even if we do, then what, huh?
tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.
we're going to get ronon back.
Yeah. Of course.
we're going to get him back.
you waste a huge opportunity by killing them.
they have no use to me beyond the information they can provide.
you underestimate their value
is it their value I underestimate, or your loyalty I overestimate?
ronon's right.
they're much more useful to you alive and cooperative.
they just need some convincing.
all right, I've got it.
we tell them we have some vital information that we're willing to give up, but we will only share it with ronon.
so they send ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him
I mean, the part of him that's still him.
well, I can only think of three things wrong with that plan, but go on.
he hasn't been brainwashed as long as tyre, which means he might be more susceptible to our influence.
we convince him to let us out or lead us out of here, and then, worst-case scenario, he's not entirely convinced
that's your worst-case scenario?
Hey, I'm just spinning here, but, you know, we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and-- and
you've been summoned.
do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?
no. No, I think I'm good.
I guess it's my turn for the sales pitch, huh?
wait.
we need to get something.
kneel.
you know what would be really creepy and unexpected, is if you knelt instead.
God...
I guess not.
all right, I'll try and make it work.
I appreciate your defiance.
Ronon, I really need you to snap out of it about now.
it will make turning you all the more enjoyable.
Teyla! Mckay! How'd you get out?
tyre freed us. Let's go.
okay, come on, guys.
go, go, go!
how's it going?
not so good!
my guys are holding them off, but not for much longer.
give me that.
tell them to back off.
my life will be a small price to pay for the lives of you and your team.
then how about the destruction of this facility?
is that a small enough price as well?
you lie.
I told them where to hide the charges for maximum effect, enough explosives to destroy this place and all of its research.
any advantage your hive may hold over its rivals will be gone with the push of a button.
wait!
tell them to let us through.
what's to stop you from triggering the explosives from a safe distance?
my presence here.
you let them go. I'll remain behind.
tyre... - once they've reached the gate,
I'll trade you this device for my freedom.
or we all die together.
let them go.
I'll be right behind you.
let's go.
you turn your back on an incredible gift.
actually, you turned your back on me first.
and I thank you for it.
we're clear.
you're not beyond forgiveness.
it's not too late for you.
Yes, it is...
for both of us.
what kind of a timeframe for recovery are we looking at?
it's impossible to predict.
he has so much of the enzyme running through him that his body can hardly process it.
when it eventually does, that's when he'll come down, and he'll come down hard.
I'm going to talk to him.
open it.
there he is.
Hey, buddy.
buddy.
so, how long are you planning on keeping me prisoner?
as long as it takes to clear your head.
my head is clear.
well, you may be feeling fine right now, but things are going to get pretty rough for you.
we're going to get you through this.
whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work.
you've got a choice
you'd better kill me or you let me go.
and if you let me go, I promise I won't come after you or atlantis.
tell tyre I won't come after him either.
tyre's dead.
he sacrificed himself taking out the wraith lab.
Yeah, well, he was a traitor.
no, he was a good friend.
we all are.
you're going to realize that pretty soon.
Hey, will you just kill me or set me free.
you kill me or set me free!
kill me please!
please kill me!
No!
I had what they called piano fingers-- slim, nimble.
it's really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons.
my first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural.
big russian woman, polanskii or baranski or...
definitely a "ski."
Hey, uh, how do you feel?
like hitting someone.
anyone in particular?
you, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.
that is a good sign.
that's a good sign!
he's back! He's back!
so he's fully recovered?
well, physically he's still weak, but his bloodwork shows no traces of the enzyme in his system, so he should be back to his old self in no time.
good to hear.
well, it's late.
I think I'll head back to my quarters and change into something a little more relaxed.
good night.
John, may I have a word?
Yeah. Sure.
Teyla. Come in.
I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed.
for me, this is more relaxed.
can I offer you a drink? - No, thank you.
I just spoke with john, and now I would like to make it official.
I'm requesting a return to active duty.
I would like to resume my position on colonel sheppard's team.
you're sure this is what you want?
very much so.
well, then, welcome back.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
good night. - Good night.
Oh yeah!
me, rakai, ara, we're your friends.
you belong with us.
you want to hit a wraith lab?
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
Oh, oh, thank god it's you three.
the wraith worshipers-- they did you.
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
rakai, no! - No weapons.
Rodney, get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
you getting any sleep these days?
not much, I'm afraid.
although things are a little easier now that kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return from the mainland.
how's he liking life in the big city?
well, he's happy to be reunited with torren and I, but he's having difficulty adjusting to life on atlantis.
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.
and you once stunned dr. Gero at your own surprise birthday party.
he spooked me.
Uh-huh.
it's difficult for kanaan.
he has torren and me, of course, but
I still think he feels isolated.
Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends.
you should get him to come by the gym sometime.
we could spar.
thank you. That's very kind of you, but I need him in one piece for the foreseeable future.
Ah, you're no fun.
Hey!
the daedalus confirms the results of your preliminary search.
there's no sign of ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet.
broken Ties
that means he's still alive.
if tyre wanted him dead, we would have found the body.
unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge.
I don't mean to sound overly negative, but from what I've heard, his mind is seriously warped.
and yet he didn't kill me.
it would have been safer for him to leave no witnesses.
so perhaps, despite what the wraith did to him, tyre still possesses his satedan sense of honor.
it didn't stop him from ambushing you.
maybe we can use that satedan sense of honor to help us find ronon.
how do you propose we do that?
we get a satedan to help us.
you happen to have one handy, do you?
Teyla knows where one is.
who?
he is a survivor of the wraith attack on sateda.
ronon and i encountered him on a trade mission to belkan two years ago.
by your description, he isn't exactly the settle-down kind of guy.
what are the chances he's still there?
there's only one way to find out.
Mr. Woolsey, permission to go off-world?
you have a go. - Great.
Oh, and teyla, will you be accompanying colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay?
I only ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty.
of course she'll be returning. Right?
I'm yet to make a decision about my future with the team.
Oh.
okay.
however, I would still like to accompany colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay to belkan.
of course.
Where's teyla?
I left her back on the planet.
don't worry. She's fine.
you know I wouldn't hurt her.
do I?
I accept the fact that you no longer trust me, but I'm hoping that will change in time.
sateda is gone.
we're the last of our kind, ronon.
we're brothers, not enemies.
we're brothers?
so I should just forgive you for setting me up last year?
if you had just listened to reason, things could have been different.
Ara and rakai would still be alive, and we'd all be working together again.
as wraith worshipers and traitors to the memory of sateda?
hell, no.
of course not.
I see that now.
you're blinded by the past, lied to by your so-called friends on atlantis.
but ilst fhaaith in you, old friend.
you just need to open your eyes to the truth.
all right.
just untie me and I'll listen to what you have to say.
would that be before or after you try to beat me unconscious?
I don't know.
you choose.
or I could just surprise you.
I don't doubt it.
what's wrong with you?
I'm not well.
but I've been worse.
you know where we are?
you remember sarif sur, don't you?
Yeah. You almost died on that run.
we botnearly died because you refused to leave me behind.
you risked your life to save me.
today...
I return the favor.
go away.
can't you see I'm trying to sleep?
we need your help.
ronon dex is in trouble.
ronon dex is always in trouble.
well, his life is in danger.
again. What else is new?
what kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?
he was abducted by a fellow satedan, a wraith worshiper by the name of tyre.
you mean former wraith worshiper.
word is the dog disappointed his masters, so they turned him loose.
well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.
not exactly.
so long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing example of what happens to humans who disappoint them.
tyre's a marked man now.
most anyone I know would kill him on sight. It's just a matter of time.
he was once a proud satedan, not unlike yourself.
he was subjected to unimaginable torture.
perhaps he had no choice.
there's always a choice.
he could have chosen death like a true satedan.
any idea where we can find him?
if I knew that, he'd already be dead.
all ght. Tyre's not thinking straight, right?
sure.
so it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up.
and when he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.
probably.
so what do you say, you contact us when you hear something.
we'll deal with tyre and save you the trip.
all right.
to ronon.
look at you.
you can barely walk.
let me get you some help.
I'm beyond your help.
it's the wraith, isn't it?
what did they do to you?
at this point, it's not so much what they did to me as what they aren't doing to me.
giving you life?
Reverse-feeding or whatever the hell it's called?
it's hard to describe.
the sense of euphoria it offers is...
you became addicted to it.
you can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself.
it was a gift, one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to escape us.
Hey, free me, and I'll get you some help.
I promise.
help is already on the way.
for both of us.
what does that mean?
what the hell did u do?
I've saved us.
I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve me.
well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.
Oh, I'm sure you'll try.
but, in the end, you'll come around.
Mr. Woolsey
any news on ronon?
not yet.
I'm sorry.
I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a proven survivor.
he defied the odds for many years as a runner.
Yes, he did.
how can I help you?
I wanted to apologize for not having come to you sooner with a decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.
take whatever time you need.
if necessary,
I can assign someone to fill in for you.
Oh...
Mr. Woolsey, do you have children?
uh, no.
but I did have a yorkie for many years.
it's a small dog.
but my wife got him in the divorce.
I loved that dog.
I never really had the chance to say goodbye.
so, no.
no children.
then, with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this is for me.
for most of my life,
I never imagined the possibility of leaving my people, not even for a moment...
and then circumstances changed.
and after realizing a far more important role on colonel sheppard's team,
I never imagined the day would come when I would have to let it go.
and now here that day is.
five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the milky way, my answer would have been a definite no.
and now...
look at me.
so...
while I can't empathize,
I certainly do sympathize.
believe me, I know
priorities change.
and sometimes they don'T.
Teyla, I'm sure kanaan will support you whatever decision you make.
Yes. Of course he will.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
how does it feel to have your life stolen?
to be pushed so close to the darkness, only to be pulled back from the brink?
from what I understand, it's a magnificent sensation.
to be honest,
I've felt better.
defy me all you want.
your fellow satedans were no different.
like them, you'll eventually submit.
I'll die before I submit.
no.
you won'T.
Hey.
you're up early.
10: 00 A. M.
it is?
Oh, god.
I didn't sleep at all. I was up all night thinking about this ronon situation.
got anything? - Nothing. I tried everything
pacing, snacking, bathing
bathing.
Yeah.
like archimedes.
you mean that greek scientist who had a crush on teyla?
no, like the greek mathematician who came up with the archimedes principle, the physical laws of buoyancy.
according to legend, the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so...
look, the point is that the revelation occurred while he was relaxing.
he was not thinking about the problem.
and the solution, as it turns out, was right in front of him all along.
you think we've overlooked something?
I don't know.
maybe. Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it and I'm drawing a blank, so I could use a fresh perspective.
I'm not taking a bath with you.
let's just go over what we know.
according to solen, tyre's on the run.
and we can assume he's operating alone because if he had backup, they would have been in on the ambush.
right. He's alone, with ronon, on the run.
so where would someone like that go?
well, I can think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect.
where do you want to start?
how about sarif sur?
what?
we just got a message from ronon's buddy, solen.
he hears that tyre and ronon are holed up on a planet called sarif sur.
thank you, archimedes.
major, get your team and gear up.
Yes, sir.
there's just no point in holding on.
you're just putting off the inevitable.
it's better if you just accept it.
you mean better for you, don't you?
the wraith cut you off and this is your way back in, by offering me up as a sacrifice.
no.
you're not the man I risked my life for.
you're a traitor to the memory of our people.
you have no honor.
things are progressing too slowly.
I have other matters to attend to.
we can continue this process back at the lab.
and when will I receive my reward?
your reward?
I brought him here as we agreed.
in exchange, you promised to restore our previous arrangement.
huh. Did I?
you promised!
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint, since your usefulness has come to an end.
we'll get him.
see that you do, colonel.
nothing.
so we were wrong.
it has been known to happen.
Hey, I always said this was a longshot.
Colonel, this is lorne.
we've got something.
I knew it.
over here.
we checked his pulse.
it's barely there. We've got to move him or we lose him.
Where's ronon? - Good question.
his injuries are minor, but both his heartrate and blood pressure are elevated.
he woke up about an hour after you brought him in.
he was delirious, he was sweating, nauseous, trembling.
so I sedated him and ran some tests.
after giving him a drug that blocks opioid receptors,
I noticed a drop in dopamine levels here
a central link in the brain's reward circuit.
right. Meaning?
meaning this type of neurochemical activity is identical to that of reforming substance-users.
he's going through withdrawal.
I need you to save him, doc.
right now, he's our only lead. If he dies, our chances of finding ronon go with him.
of course. But it could be days before he's coherent enough to tell us anything.
John! Why wasn't I informed about the mission to rescue ronon?
we were playing on a hunch. We had to act fast.
I'm going go, um, see if they're still serving lunch.
it's taquito tuesday.
I think I'll join you.
I'm surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without me.
don't put this on me.
you're the one having second thoughts about returning to the team.
I cannot give you the option every time we're going off-world.
this is not an easy decision for me.
you think you're the only one feeling pressure?
I've got woolsey pushing me hard to find a replacement for you.
what did you tell him?
I told him that I wasn't going to do anything until I talked to you.
now, if you want to join the team, great.
I'll call woolsey. I'll make it happen.
but if you want to spend time with your son, I understand. I do. I really do.
you've got to make a decision.
you're finally awake.
the procedure can be very taxing.
you've been unconscious for the better part of a day.
you're wasting your time.
I'll die before I turn.
just like marika and hemi.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
your friends didn't die because they were strong.
they died because they were too weak to withstand the process.
their minds and bodies eventually shut down under the strain.
but you...
you're stronger.
and it is your strength that will prove your undoing.
he broke through his restraints this morning and injured two guards, so I thought it would be best to put him in isolation.
at least this way, if he breaks free again, he won't be an immediate danger to anyone.
how long is it going to take him to go through this?
to be honest, I'm not even sure he will.
please!
you're killing me!
please!
can't you give him something for the pain?
sedatives will make him more comfortable, but they'll also slow down his recovery.
I want this to go as quick as possible. No sedatives.
he's already sleeping?
why does it take so much longer when I try to put him down?
you worry too much.
perhaps he senses your anxiety.
maybe he prefers the comfort of his mother's presence.
well, there may be times when he will have to learn to do without.
does that mean you've decided?
I thought so...
how can I return to the team with the knowledge that every time I step through the gate, there is a chance that I might not come back?
that, given the dangers, there's a possibility that our son will grow up without a mother?
you have a responsibility to him.
but you also have a responsibility to the people of this galaxy.
follow your heart without remorse.
and take comfort in knowing that you'll be doing so to safeguard the future of many, including your son.
just promise me you'll be careful out there.
he's been awake and lucid for about 10 minutes now.
what did he say?
only that he wanted to talk to you.
I know where they've taken ronon.
you can give us a gate address?
better. I'll lead you right into the heart of the facility.
well, you're still recovering.
Dr. Keller told me there were no longer any traces of the wraith enzyme in my system.
that's not the point. - Colonel, please.
let me help you get ronon back.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
no mercy for our enemies.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
and no mercy to your enemies.
our enemies.
no mercy.
he seems rational, says he wants to help us.
I say we trust him only as much as we have to.
use his intel, but he stays here, under guard.
if you want to hit that wraith facility, we'll need all the help we can get, and apparently he knows that place inside and out.
Yes, and is thus in the perfect position to lead you right into a trap.
all right, look, I think, as much as he'd like us to believe it, this is not about regaining some lost honor, or some satedan revenge thing.
pure and simple-- this is about a desperate guy who's willing to do anything to help his buddy.
and how can you be so certain of that, colonel?
because I've been there.
now, we have a chance to get ronon, and I'm going to take it, and you're going to need to trust me on this.
all right.
major lorne's team will be accompanying you.
what is it? What's happening?
we know where ronon is.
I'm coming with you.
gear up.
uh, teyla, this is exactly the kind of decision we were
I was about to meet kanaan in the cafeteria.
would you please explain to him the situation?
it's all right.
please.
all right.
well, well, well, who have we here?
cafeteria.
cafeteria.
this way.
what is this place?
you were looking for a target area that would maximize the effects of your explosives.
well, this is it, the facility's power relay cham R.
hide your charges to avoid discovery.
let's go.
I assume you have a means to remote-detonate from a safe distance?
well, just flip...
click.
this way.
it's about time.
what's going on, buddy?
we were beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up.
you're at a disadvantage.
you could attempt an escape, but you'll have to sacrifice your friend's life to do so.
Ronon, get out of the way.
I can't do that.
Ronon, step aside.
his life wouldn't be the only one forfeit.
lower your weapons.
take them away.
Ronon, what's happening here?
I assume this is a prize worthy of reward?
welcome back.
well, you know, on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go back to atlantis and hear woolsey say "I told you so.
we're going to get out of here.
Oh, sure, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right?
I mean, get past all of the armed wraith that are guarding the facility and free lorne and his team from wherever they're being held, get back to the jumper, which is probably being disassembled as we speak, and of course we've got to rescue ronon who, I don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself.
we're going to get ronon and we're going to go back to atlantis.
and even if we do, then what, huh?
tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.
we're going to get ronon back.
Yeah. Of course.
we're going to get him back.
you waste a huge opportunity by killing them.
they have no use to me beyond the information they can provide.
you underestimate their value
is it their value I underestimate, or your loyalty I overestimate?
ronon's right.
they're much more useful to you alive and cooperative.
they just need some convincing.
all right, I've got it.
we tell them we have some vital information that we're willing to give up, but we will only share it with ronon.
so they send ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him
I mean, the part of him that's still him.
well, I can only think of three things wrong with that plan, but go on.
he hasn't been brainwashed as long as tyre, which means he might be more susceptible to our influence.
we convince him to let us out or lead us out of here, and then, worst-case scenario, he's not entirely convinced
that's your worst-case scenario?
Hey, I'm just spinning here, but, you know, we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and-- and
you've been summoned.
do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?
no. No, I think I'm good.
I guess it's my turn for the sales pitch, huh?
wait.
we need to get something.
kneel.
you know what would be really creepy and unexpected, is if you knelt instead.
God...
I guess not.
all right, I'll try and make it work.
I appreciate your defiance.
Ronon, I really need you to snap out of it about now.
it will make turning you all the more enjoyable.
Teyla! Mckay! How'd you get out?
tyre freed us. Let's go.
okay, come on, guys.
go, go, go!
how's it going?
not so good!
my guys are holding them off, but not for much longer.
give me that.
tell them to back off.
my life will be a small price to pay for the lives of you and your team.
then how about the destruction of this facility?
is that a small enough price as well?
you lie.
I told them where to hide the charges for maximum effect, enough explosives to destroy this place and all of its research.
any advantage your hive may hold over its rivals will be gone with the push of a button.
wait!
tell them to let us through.
what's to stop you from triggering the explosives from a safe distance?
my presence here.
you let them go. I'll remain behind.
tyre... - once they've reached the gate,
I'll trade you this device for my freedom.
or we all die together.
let them go.
I'll be right behind you.
let's go.
you turn your back on an incredible gift.
actually, you turned your back on me first.
and I thank you for it.
we're clear.
you're not beyond forgiveness.
it's not too late for you.
Yes, it is...
for both of us.
what kind of a timeframe for recovery are we looking at?
it's impossible to predict.
he has so much of the enzyme running through him that his body can hardly process it.
when it eventually does, that's when he'll come down, and he'll come down hard.
I'm going to talk to him.
open it.
there he is.
Hey, buddy.
buddy.
so, how long are you planning on keeping me prisoner?
as long as it takes to clear your head.
my head is clear.
well, you may be feeling fine right now, but things are going to get pretty rough for you.
we're going to get you through this.
whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work.
you've got a choice
you'd better kill me or you let me go.
and if you let me go, I promise I won't come after you or atlantis.
tell tyre I won't come after him either.
tyre's dead.
he sacrificed himself taking out the wraith lab.
Yeah, well, he was a traitor.
no, he was a good friend.
we all are.
you're going to realize that pretty soon.
Hey, will you just kill me or set me free.
you kill me or set me free!
kill me please!
please kill me!
No!
I had what they called piano fingers-- slim, nimble.
it's really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons.
my first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural.
big russian woman, polanskii or baranski or...
definitely a "ski."
Hey, uh, how do you feel?
like hitting someone.
anyone in particular?
you, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.
that is a good sign.
that's a good sign!
he's back! He's back!
so he's fully recovered?
well, physically he's still weak, but his bloodwork shows no traces of the enzyme in his system, so he should be back to his old self in no time.
good to hear.
well, it's late.
I think I'll head back to my quarters and change into something a little more relaxed.
good night.
John, may I have a word?
Yeah. Sure.
Teyla. Come in.
I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed.
for me, this is more relaxed.
can I offer you a drink? - No, thank you.
I just spoke with john, and now I would like to make it official.
I'm requesting a return to active duty.
I would like to resume my position on colonel sheppard's team.
you're sure this is what you want?
very much so.
well, then, welcome back.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
good night. - Good night.
Oh yeah!
me, rakai, ara, we're your friends.
you belong with us.
you want to hit a wraith lab?
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
Oh, oh, thank god it's you three.
the wraith worshipers-- they did you.
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
rakai, no! - No weapons.
Rodney, get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
you getting any sleep these days?
not much, I'm afraid.
although things are a little easier now that kanaan's request has been granted and he's been allowed to return from the mainland.
how's he liking life in the big city?
well, he's happy to be reunited with torren and I, but he's having difficulty adjusting to life on atlantis.
Yeah, I hear the shower scared him.
and you once stunned dr. Gero at your own surprise birthday party.
he spooked me.
Uh-huh.
it's difficult for kanaan.
he has torren and me, of course, but
I still think he feels isolated.
Yeah, well, he just needs to make some new friends.
you should get him to come by the gym sometime.
we could spar.
thank you. That's very kind of you, but I need him in one piece for the foreseeable future.
Ah, you're no fun.
Hey!
the daedalus confirms the results of your preliminary search.
there's no sign of ronon's subcutaneous transmitter anywhere on that planet.
broken Ties
that means he's still alive.
if tyre wanted him dead, we would have found the body.
unless he just took him somewhere to exact a slow revenge.
I don't mean to sound overly negative, but from what I've heard, his mind is seriously warped.
and yet he didn't kill me.
it would have been safer for him to leave no witnesses.
so perhaps, despite what the wraith did to him, tyre still possesses his satedan sense of honor.
it didn't stop him from ambushing you.
maybe we can use that satedan sense of honor to help us find ronon.
how do you propose we do that?
we get a satedan to help us.
you happen to have one handy, do you?
Teyla knows where one is.
who?
he is a survivor of the wraith attack on sateda.
ronon and i encountered him on a trade mission to belkan two years ago.
by your description, he isn't exactly the settle-down kind of guy.
what are the chances he's still there?
there's only one way to find out.
Mr. Woolsey, permission to go off-world?
you have a go. - Great.
Oh, and teyla, will you be accompanying colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay?
I only ask because I've yet to receive your formal request to return to active duty.
of course she'll be returning. Right?
I'm yet to make a decision about my future with the team.
Oh.
okay.
however, I would still like to accompany colonel sheppard and dr. Mckay to belkan.
of course.
Where's teyla?
I left her back on the planet.
don't worry. She's fine.
you know I wouldn't hurt her.
do I?
I accept the fact that you no longer trust me, but I'm hoping that will change in time.
sateda is gone.
we're the last of our kind, ronon.
we're brothers, not enemies.
we're brothers?
so I should just forgive you for setting me up last year?
if you had just listened to reason, things could have been different.
Ara and rakai would still be alive, and we'd all be working together again.
as wraith worshipers and traitors to the memory of sateda?
hell, no.
of course not.
I see that now.
you're blinded by the past, lied to by your so-called friends on atlantis.
but ilst fhaaith in you, old friend.
you just need to open your eyes to the truth.
all right.
just untie me and I'll listen to what you have to say.
would that be before or after you try to beat me unconscious?
I don't know.
you choose.
or I could just surprise you.
I don't doubt it.
what's wrong with you?
I'm not well.
but I've been worse.
you know where we are?
you remember sarif sur, don't you?
Yeah. You almost died on that run.
we botnearly died because you refused to leave me behind.
you risked your life to save me.
today...
I return the favor.
go away.
can't you see I'm trying to sleep?
we need your help.
ronon dex is in trouble.
ronon dex is always in trouble.
well, his life is in danger.
again. What else is new?
what kind of trouble has he gotten himself into this time?
he was abducted by a fellow satedan, a wraith worshiper by the name of tyre.
you mean former wraith worshiper.
word is the dog disappointed his masters, so they turned him loose.
well, that's uncharacteristically kind of them.
not exactly.
so long as he's on the run, he's a living, breathing example of what happens to humans who disappoint them.
tyre's a marked man now.
most anyone I know would kill him on sight. It's just a matter of time.
he was once a proud satedan, not unlike yourself.
he was subjected to unimaginable torture.
perhaps he had no choice.
there's always a choice.
he could have chosen death like a true satedan.
any idea where we can find him?
if I knew that, he'd already be dead.
all ght. Tyre's not thinking straight, right?
sure.
so it's probably just a matter of time before he slips up.
and when he does, I'm assuming your leads will hear about it.
probably.
so what do you say, you contact us when you hear something.
we'll deal with tyre and save you the trip.
all right.
to ronon.
look at you.
you can barely walk.
let me get you some help.
I'm beyond your help.
it's the wraith, isn't it?
what did they do to you?
at this point, it's not so much what they did to me as what they aren't doing to me.
giving you life?
Reverse-feeding or whatever the hell it's called?
it's hard to describe.
the sense of euphoria it offers is...
you became addicted to it.
you can't understand unless you've experienced it yourself.
it was a gift, one that was denied me after I allowed you and your friends to escape us.
Hey, free me, and I'll get you some help.
I promise.
help is already on the way.
for both of us.
what does that mean?
what the hell did u do?
I've saved us.
I looked forward to the day when you would finally serve me.
well, then, I'm going to feel real bad disappointing you.
Oh, I'm sure you'll try.
but, in the end, you'll come around.
Mr. Woolsey
any news on ronon?
not yet.
I'm sorry.
I suppose we can draw comfort from the fact that he is a proven survivor.
he defied the odds for many years as a runner.
Yes, he did.
how can I help you?
I wanted to apologize for not having come to you sooner with a decision regarding my position on the colonel's team.
take whatever time you need.
if necessary,
I can assign someone to fill in for you.
Oh...
Mr. Woolsey, do you have children?
uh, no.
but I did have a yorkie for many years.
it's a small dog.
but my wife got him in the divorce.
I loved that dog.
I never really had the chance to say goodbye.
so, no.
no children.
then, with all due respect, you may not understand how difficult this is for me.
for most of my life,
I never imagined the possibility of leaving my people, not even for a moment...
and then circumstances changed.
and after realizing a far more important role on colonel sheppard's team,
I never imagined the day would come when I would have to let it go.
and now here that day is.
five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the milky way, my answer would have been a definite no.
and now...
look at me.
so...
while I can't empathize,
I certainly do sympathize.
believe me, I know
priorities change.
and sometimes they don'T.
Teyla, I'm sure kanaan will support you whatever decision you make.
Yes. Of course he will.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
how does it feel to have your life stolen?
to be pushed so close to the darkness, only to be pulled back from the brink?
from what I understand, it's a magnificent sensation.
to be honest,
I've felt better.
defy me all you want.
your fellow satedans were no different.
like them, you'll eventually submit.
I'll die before I submit.
no.
you won'T.
Hey.
you're up early.
10: 00 A. M.
it is?
Oh, god.
I didn't sleep at all. I was up all night thinking about this ronon situation.
got anything? - Nothing. I tried everything
pacing, snacking, bathing
bathing.
Yeah.
like archimedes.
you mean that greek scientist who had a crush on teyla?
no, like the greek mathematician who came up with the archimedes principle, the physical laws of buoyancy.
according to legend, the idea came to him when he was sitting in the bath, so...
look, the point is that the revelation occurred while he was relaxing.
he was not thinking about the problem.
and the solution, as it turns out, was right in front of him all along.
you think we've overlooked something?
I don't know.
maybe. Look, all I know is I was up all night going over it and I'm drawing a blank, so I could use a fresh perspective.
I'm not taking a bath with you.
let's just go over what we know.
according to solen, tyre's on the run.
and we can assume he's operating alone because if he had backup, they would have been in on the ambush.
right. He's alone, with ronon, on the run.
so where would someone like that go?
well, I can think of something like 200 uninhabited planets that would be perfect.
where do you want to start?
how about sarif sur?
what?
we just got a message from ronon's buddy, solen.
he hears that tyre and ronon are holed up on a planet called sarif sur.
thank you, archimedes.
major, get your team and gear up.
Yes, sir.
there's just no point in holding on.
you're just putting off the inevitable.
it's better if you just accept it.
you mean better for you, don't you?
the wraith cut you off and this is your way back in, by offering me up as a sacrifice.
no.
you're not the man I risked my life for.
you're a traitor to the memory of our people.
you have no honor.
things are progressing too slowly.
I have other matters to attend to.
we can continue this process back at the lab.
and when will I receive my reward?
your reward?
I brought him here as we agreed.
in exchange, you promised to restore our previous arrangement.
huh. Did I?
you promised!
I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint, since your usefulness has come to an end.
we'll get him.
see that you do, colonel.
nothing.
so we were wrong.
it has been known to happen.
Hey, I always said this was a longshot.
Colonel, this is lorne.
we've got something.
I knew it.
over here.
we checked his pulse.
it's barely there. We've got to move him or we lose him.
Where's ronon? - Good question.
his injuries are minor, but both his heartrate and blood pressure are elevated.
he woke up about an hour after you brought him in.
he was delirious, he was sweating, nauseous, trembling.
so I sedated him and ran some tests.
after giving him a drug that blocks opioid receptors,
I noticed a drop in dopamine levels here
a central link in the brain's reward circuit.
right. Meaning?
meaning this type of neurochemical activity is identical to that of reforming substance-users.
he's going through withdrawal.
I need you to save him, doc.
right now, he's our only lead. If he dies, our chances of finding ronon go with him.
of course. But it could be days before he's coherent enough to tell us anything.
John! Why wasn't I informed about the mission to rescue ronon?
we were playing on a hunch. We had to act fast.
I'm going go, um, see if they're still serving lunch.
it's taquito tuesday.
I think I'll join you.
I'm surprised that you would be so quick to move forward without me.
don't put this on me.
you're the one having second thoughts about returning to the team.
I cannot give you the option every time we're going off-world.
this is not an easy decision for me.
you think you're the only one feeling pressure?
I've got woolsey pushing me hard to find a replacement for you.
what did you tell him?
I told him that I wasn't going to do anything until I talked to you.
now, if you want to join the team, great.
I'll call woolsey. I'll make it happen.
but if you want to spend time with your son, I understand. I do. I really do.
you've got to make a decision.
you're finally awake.
the procedure can be very taxing.
you've been unconscious for the better part of a day.
you're wasting your time.
I'll die before I turn.
just like marika and hemi.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
your friends didn't die because they were strong.
they died because they were too weak to withstand the process.
their minds and bodies eventually shut down under the strain.
but you...
you're stronger.
and it is your strength that will prove your undoing.
he broke through his restraints this morning and injured two guards, so I thought it would be best to put him in isolation.
at least this way, if he breaks free again, he won't be an immediate danger to anyone.
how long is it going to take him to go through this?
to be honest, I'm not even sure he will.
please!
you're killing me!
please!
can't you give him something for the pain?
sedatives will make him more comfortable, but they'll also slow down his recovery.
I want this to go as quick as possible. No sedatives.
he's already sleeping?
why does it take so much longer when I try to put him down?
you worry too much.
perhaps he senses your anxiety.
maybe he prefers the comfort of his mother's presence.
well, there may be times when he will have to learn to do without.
does that mean you've decided?
I thought so...
how can I return to the team with the knowledge that every time I step through the gate, there is a chance that I might not come back?
that, given the dangers, there's a possibility that our son will grow up without a mother?
you have a responsibility to him.
but you also have a responsibility to the people of this galaxy.
follow your heart without remorse.
and take comfort in knowing that you'll be doing so to safeguard the future of many, including your son.
just promise me you'll be careful out there.
he's been awake and lucid for about 10 minutes now.
what did he say?
only that he wanted to talk to you.
I know where they've taken ronon.
you can give us a gate address?
better. I'll lead you right into the heart of the facility.
well, you're still recovering.
Dr. Keller told me there were no longer any traces of the wraith enzyme in my system.
that's not the point. - Colonel, please.
let me help you get ronon back.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
no mercy for our enemies.
no retreat in the face of battle.
no sympathy for the fallen.
and no mercy to your enemies.
our enemies.
no mercy.
he seems rational, says he wants to help us.
I say we trust him only as much as we have to.
use his intel, but he stays here, under guard.
if you want to hit that wraith facility, we'll need all the help we can get, and apparently he knows that place inside and out.
Yes, and is thus in the perfect position to lead you right into a trap.
all right, look, I think, as much as he'd like us to believe it, this is not about regaining some lost honor, or some satedan revenge thing.
pure and simple-- this is about a desperate guy who's willing to do anything to help his buddy.
and how can you be so certain of that, colonel?
because I've been there.
now, we have a chance to get ronon, and I'm going to take it, and you're going to need to trust me on this.
all right.
major lorne's team will be accompanying you.
what is it? What's happening?
we know where ronon is.
I'm coming with you.
gear up.
uh, teyla, this is exactly the kind of decision we were
I was about to meet kanaan in the cafeteria.
would you please explain to him the situation?
it's all right.
please.
all right.
well, well, well, who have we here?
cafeteria.
cafeteria.
this way.
what is this place?
you were looking for a target area that would maximize the effects of your explosives.
well, this is it, the facility's power relay cham R.
hide your charges to avoid discovery.
let's go.
I assume you have a means to remote-detonate from a safe distance?
well, just flip...
click.
this way.
it's about time.
what's going on, buddy?
we were beginning to wonder if you'd ever show up.
you're at a disadvantage.
you could attempt an escape, but you'll have to sacrifice your friend's life to do so.
Ronon, get out of the way.
I can't do that.
Ronon, step aside.
his life wouldn't be the only one forfeit.
lower your weapons.
take them away.
Ronon, what's happening here?
I assume this is a prize worthy of reward?
welcome back.
well, you know, on the bright side, at least we'll never have to go back to atlantis and hear woolsey say "I told you so.
we're going to get out of here.
Oh, sure, all we have to do is escape from this cell, right?
I mean, get past all of the armed wraith that are guarding the facility and free lorne and his team from wherever they're being held, get back to the jumper, which is probably being disassembled as we speak, and of course we've got to rescue ronon who, I don't know if you happened to notice or not, isn't quite himself.
we're going to get ronon and we're going to go back to atlantis.
and even if we do, then what, huh?
tyre's recovery hasn't exactly been the rousing success we were hoping for.
we're going to get ronon back.
Yeah. Of course.
we're going to get him back.
you waste a huge opportunity by killing them.
they have no use to me beyond the information they can provide.
you underestimate their value
is it their value I underestimate, or your loyalty I overestimate?
ronon's right.
they're much more useful to you alive and cooperative.
they just need some convincing.
all right, I've got it.
we tell them we have some vital information that we're willing to give up, but we will only share it with ronon.
so they send ronon, he shows up, we appeal to him
I mean, the part of him that's still him.
well, I can only think of three things wrong with that plan, but go on.
he hasn't been brainwashed as long as tyre, which means he might be more susceptible to our influence.
we convince him to let us out or lead us out of here, and then, worst-case scenario, he's not entirely convinced
that's your worst-case scenario?
Hey, I'm just spinning here, but, you know, we could take advantage of that moment of uncertainty and-- and
you've been summoned.
do you want to, uh, go over the plan one more time?
no. No, I think I'm good.
I guess it's my turn for the sales pitch, huh?
wait.
we need to get something.
kneel.
you know what would be really creepy and unexpected, is if you knelt instead.
God...
I guess not.
all right, I'll try and make it work.
I appreciate your defiance.
Ronon, I really need you to snap out of it about now.
it will make turning you all the more enjoyable.
Teyla! Mckay! How'd you get out?
tyre freed us. Let's go.
okay, come on, guys.
go, go, go!
how's it going?
not so good!
my guys are holding them off, but not for much longer.
give me that.
tell them to back off.
my life will be a small price to pay for the lives of you and your team.
then how about the destruction of this facility?
is that a small enough price as well?
you lie.
I told them where to hide the charges for maximum effect, enough explosives to destroy this place and all of its research.
any advantage your hive may hold over its rivals will be gone with the push of a button.
wait!
tell them to let us through.
what's to stop you from triggering the explosives from a safe distance?
my presence here.
you let them go. I'll remain behind.
tyre... - once they've reached the gate,
I'll trade you this device for my freedom.
or we all die together.
let them go.
I'll be right behind you.
let's go.
you turn your back on an incredible gift.
actually, you turned your back on me first.
and I thank you for it.
we're clear.
you're not beyond forgiveness.
it's not too late for you.
Yes, it is...
for both of us.
what kind of a timeframe for recovery are we looking at?
it's impossible to predict.
he has so much of the enzyme running through him that his body can hardly process it.
when it eventually does, that's when he'll come down, and he'll come down hard.
I'm going to talk to him.
open it.
there he is.
Hey, buddy.
buddy.
so, how long are you planning on keeping me prisoner?
as long as it takes to clear your head.
my head is clear.
well, you may be feeling fine right now, but things are going to get pretty rough for you.
we're going to get you through this.
whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work.
you've got a choice
you'd better kill me or you let me go.
and if you let me go, I promise I won't come after you or atlantis.
tell tyre I won't come after him either.
tyre's dead.
he sacrificed himself taking out the wraith lab.
Yeah, well, he was a traitor.
no, he was a good friend.
we all are.
you're going to realize that pretty soon.
Hey, will you just kill me or set me free.
you kill me or set me free!
kill me please!
please kill me!
No!
I had what they called piano fingers-- slim, nimble.
it's really no surprise that my parents signed me up for lessons.
my first teacher, of course, hailed me as a natural.
big russian woman, polanskii or baranski or...
definitely a "ski."
Hey, uh, how do you feel?
like hitting someone.
anyone in particular?
you, if you don't loosen these straps and get me something to eat.
that is a good sign.
that's a good sign!
he's back! He's back!
so he's fully recovered?
well, physically he's still weak, but his bloodwork shows no traces of the enzyme in his system, so he should be back to his old self in no time.
good to hear.
well, it's late.
I think I'll head back to my quarters and change into something a little more relaxed.
good night.
John, may I have a word?
Yeah. Sure.
Teyla. Come in.
I thought you said you were changing into something more relaxed.
for me, this is more relaxed.
can I offer you a drink? - No, thank you.
I just spoke with john, and now I would like to make it official.
I'm requesting a return to active duty.
I would like to resume my position on colonel sheppard's team.
you're sure this is what you want?
very much so.
well, then, welcome back.
thank you, mr. Woolsey.
good night. - Good night.
what are you talking about?
Oh yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me that he's just settled down.
can you blame her? You dropped him.
I did not drop him, he jumped.
jumped? - Well, he wiggled out of my arms.
I said I was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I possibly have done?
he fell, like, maybe two feet.
stuff like that happens all the time.
I mean, I was dropped like, a dozen times when I was a kid.
well, that explains a lot.
why do you even care? You don't even like kids. - It's the principle of the thing.
everybody else gets to hold him. Why shouldn't I?
Colonel...
we've got a new contact. Looks like a ship.
how far out?
it's in orbit.
well, how come we didn't detect it?
I don't know. We didn't even detect a hyperspace window.
it just appeared out of nowhere.
hang on a second, we're getting I. F.F.
it's the Daedalus.
the Daedalus? How can that be? They're on their way back to earth.
well, they were. They were supposed to be.
open up a channel.
Daedalus, this is Atlantis, please come in.
Daedalus, please respond.
they're not going to answer.
why not?
because I'm not reading any lifesigns.
what are you telling me, Rodney, this thing flew here by itself?
I don't know how they got here, but there's no one on board.
Colonel, we just got confirmation from stargate command.
the Daedalus is in the Milky Way, on course and on schedule.
the Daedalus Variations
they expect to reach earth within two days.
understood.
so that's not the Daedalus, then.
not unless it can be in two places at once.
perhaps the Apollo, or one of your other ships... - They wouldn't be sending daedalus I. F.F..
plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up lifesign readings.
all right, I'm taking us in for a closer look.
wow, you see that?
Yeah, some scorch marks.
you think weapon's fire?
well, wherever she's been, she's been through some pretty hard times.
what's that?
I'm picking up an energy reading.
it's coming from the ship.
is it dangerous?
I don't think so, but I have no idea what's causing it.
can you get the bay doors open?
if the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest of it, it shouldn't be a problem.
no F-302s, but there's a jumper.
you sure there's no one else inside?
as far as I can tell.
all right, we're going in.
why is it so cold in here?
the ship's operating on emergency power.
some of the systems are barely registering.
except for the whole weird energy thing.
that's right.
can you do something about it? It's freezing in here.
Oh, sure, I just have to get to engineering.
you and Ronon are together. Teyla, you and I are going to check out the bridge.
radio me if you find anything.
no bodies in here.
Colonel...
it's the Daedalus , all right.
McKay, is that you?
of course it was me. Who else would it be?
you think we've got a ghost on board or something?
will you please not touch anything!
what's our status?
I've restored basic power to most of the ship.
it should be warming up any second now.
good.
check on that energy reading. Try to figure out what it is, all right?
I'm on it.
Colonel...
ship's log, last entry.
preparations are almost complete.
we've beamed down the last of our supplies, and any equipment we think might be useful.
I'll be taking the last of the F-302s down myself.
of course, we haven't had time to do a proper survey of the planet's surface, but it seems habitable enough.
plenty of fresh water, arable soil, not that different from our own.
I realize our chance of rescue is slim, but it's become obvious that we no longer have a choice.
this is colonel Sobol, commander of the Daedalus , signing off.
do you recognize her?
I've never seen her before in my life.
well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.
Yeah. The question is, why?
I'll check previous entries.
man, this ship has been through the wringer.
no, hyperdrive, subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair, the shields are virtually depleted...
what is it?
it's the energy reading.
it's spiking.
Sheppard, come in.
go ahead.
something's happening. The energy reading, it's going off the charts.
do something. Turn it off.
I don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any of the main systems.
Colonel sheppard, this is Atlantis. We're picking up some kind of power surge coming from the ship.
Yeah, we noticed it. We're trying to check it out ourselves.
the levels are still rising.
Colonel, should we send another jumper to assist?
stand by.
all right, that's our cue to leave.
everyone, back in the jumper.
McKay, what the hell was that?
I have no idea, but the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual?
Atlantis, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Colonel sheppard, do you read?
Daedalus , this is Atlantis, please respond.
what the hell's going on?
I don't know. One moment they were there, the next minute, they were gone.
I'm having problems with communications. I can't reach Atlantis.
wait a second.
that can't be right.
what?
I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.
what are you talking about?
I just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing down there but ocean.
well, maybe they cloaked.
well, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.
well, I don't know, maybe there's a wraith ship in the area.
I'm not reading anything.
are we certain it's the same planet?
perhaps the energy burst shifted our position.
no, according to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.
what do you want me to believe, Rodney?
that Atlantis just disappeared?
look, I don't know. Just give me a second, I'll figure it out, all right?
in the meantime, I've managed to localize the source of the energy reading.
it's coming from a hold on deck 9.
all right, keep trying to reach Atlantis. We'll check it out.
Sheppard, I think I've got something.
it's the residual radiation from the flash.
it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window, but different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.
what the hell does that mean?
I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.
I thought you said we didn't go anywhere.
we didn'T. At least not according to the ship's navigational systems.
so, a malfunctioning drive?
maybe. Just hang on.
Oh, my god, Sheppard. - Stand by, Rodney.
no, you don't understand, I know what it is.
look, the residual radiation.
it's exactly what we recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from an alternate reality.
I can't believe I didn't see this before.
Sheppard, hey.
it's a drive all right, but it didn't move us through space.
I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.
that would explain a lot of things.
how long have they been dead for?
this place was like a meat locker.
they could've been preserved like this for months.
they look just like us.
that's because they are us, the alternate reality versions of us.
I feel like someone just walked over my grave.
take it easy. Everything's fine.
Oh, no, no, no, this is very bad.
this tablet belonged to the other Mckay.
they weren't part of the original crew. They came here just like us.
look, a ship appeared in orbit above their Atlantis, they came to check it out.
that would explain the other jumper in the bay.
the ship jumped to another reality, and they were stuck, they couldn't get back.
look, eventually their supplies ran out, and they...
all right, all right, mystery solved. Let's move on.
don't you realize what this means?
they were us, and they failed.
well, they're not us. We're still alive. Let's go.
the answer's in here somewhere.
can you power up the systems?
Yeah, just hold on.
all right, that's a start.
what's behind here?
that's a good question.
I'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.
can you figure out how to control it?
offhand, I'd say no.
that's what the other Mckay was trying to do, and he had weeks.
fine.
I'll start with his research.
it'll at least give us a head start.
that's better. We're going to go look or supplies.
you don't think the other us wouldn't have already tried that? - Get to work.
did you find anything?
not unless you know a way to cook this.
perhaps we should consider going down to the planet to collect supplies.
Sheppard says it's too risky.
the drive could kick in, and the ship could take off without us.
then we'd be stuck here.
the others that we found...
do you think their lives were very similar to ours?
who cares?
how can you say that?
we've seen our doubles before.
Replicator-manufactured copies.
I can't help but wondering who might still be waiting for her back on her Atlantis.
do you mean, did she also have a son?
the thought had crossed my mind.
look...
I've heard Mckay talk about this stuff before, and supposedly,
which also means there's a million different Torrens.
you going to worry about every one of them?
no.
it's difficult enough worrying about one.
I'll bet it is.
come on.
why is the blast door closed?
Oh, right.
have you made any progress?
we?
me and the other Mckay, who, unsurprisingly, is a genius.
not only that, but it looks like the drive was created by yet another Mckay from the original reality.
what makes you say that?
well, there's a certain, um, elegance to the design that I recognize.
I'm sure that's what the crew was saying when they abandoned ship.
well, admittedly there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.
all right.
so, what do we do?
can we just throw this thing in reverse?
uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that.
the first problem is navigation.
they've developed a coordinate system to identify the various realities and allow them to get back, but obviously that didn't work.
obviously.
that's not what bothers me.
it's power generation, and jumping from one reality to another requires massive amounts of power.
we're talking ZPM levels here.
obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around, so they created a capacitor that's constantly drawing power from subspace.
and it looks like it's almost charged.
is this your long-winded way of telling me you just can't turn it off?
think of it like a tap, pouring water into a bucket.
when the bucket is full, the drive engages, except this particular tap has no valve.
that seems like a pretty serious design flaw, don't you think?
exactly.
which leads me to believe they were tampering with it, in a vain attempt to generate more power.
as they got further and further from their own reality,
I guess they figured they'd need it to get back.
and here we go.
okay.
where are we?
Oh, don't look at me.
I haven't had time to route the main systems to these control panels.
I'm flying blind down here.
Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.
on our way.
keep it up, Rodney.
Colonel, Atlantis is back.
I'm picking them up on the sensors.
you know how to work this stuff?
I was busy.
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
maybe they already have a Sheppard.
what are the odds of us randomly jumping back into our own reality?
I'd say slim to none.
I'm detecting another ship in orbit.
what kind?
I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.
I don't recognize it.
what's that?
you know it?
no.
Colonel, I believe the ship is powering weapons.
what's our shield status?
minimal.
it's firing on Atlantis.
the city's shields are failing.
Rodney, do we have enough juice to power up the Asgard beam?
maybe. You might be able to get a couple of shots off.
Why?
there's some alien ship attacking Atlantis.
so?
what do you mean, "so?" It's Atlantis!
it's not our Atlantis.
we have no idea who's down there. Look, we should just stay out of it.
if we do not intervene, the city will be destroyed.
Yeah, we need help.
my gut tells me we're better off going with the people on that planet than whoever's on that ship.
I hope you're right.
Yeah, well, me too.
the ship's been damaged. It's stopped firing.
hopefully we took out its main weapons.
wait, something's happening.
they're launching fighters.
you should've took marks up when you had the chance. Now you'll have to learn fast.
Rail-gun targeting systems.
button's on the right. Control, radar, tracking, and target acquisition, use the red button to fire.
what the hell was that?
we're under attack. Any chance of getting that hyperdrive back online?
great.
there's too many of them. I can't do this. - Keep trying!
we've lost sublight.
we have a hull breach.
we're venting atmosphere. I don't know what to do.
seal off damaged areas. We should be okay for the moment.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sheppard, I have an idea!
let's hear it.
I've set up a few protocols that should increase the efficiency of the alternate reality drive.
drive if I enable them, we might be able jump sooner.
what, jump to the next universe?
Exactly!
but if I do this, I can't undo it!
I mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster!
do it.
it worked.
where are we?
we have a problem.
temperature in the hull is rising rapidly.
what the hell is this?
according to these readings, we're less than two million kilometers from the surface of the sun.
I thought we always jumped to the same place in every reality.
as did I.
hull temperature is approaching critical.
if we do not restore shields, we're going to burn.
are you sure about this?
well, we're not imagining it, Rodney.
let me transfer the sensors down to the station. Then at least I can...
Ooh...
well, you're definitely not imagining that.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
I don't understand it. We always jump to the same relative position in space.
unless...
unless what?
you said when you went to the future, you saw our sun expanding into a red giant, remember?
what are you saying, we're jumping through time now?
no, no, no, no, no, but maybe what eventually happens in our reality is happening in this one, only much sooner.
we didn't go to the sun. The sun came to us.
so how does this help us?
I-I don't know.
I just, I found it interesting.
what's interesting, Rodney, is a way out of this without getting fried, like getting sublight back on, so we can get the hell out of here.
actually, I think our best bet is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields, and ride it out till the next jump.
when does that happen?
well, the time the capacitor takes to charge is different now that I've enacted those new protocols.
you know, um...
I have no idea.
you're not exactly selling the plan, Rodney.
I have no idea how long it would take me to fix the sublights either!
look, I've got to run a diagnostic, but theoretically, transferring power to the shields should be relatively easy.
all right, what do we do?
the first I need you to do is head down to engineering.
let's go.
all right, we're here. What do we do?
you need to kill all power to non-essential decks.
which means you're going to have to access the main administrative interface.
that should bring up a list of all available override commands.
got it.
okay.
so choose the command for life support.
you'll have to designate the decks one by one.
I think that's all of them.
dammit.
that didn't buy us nearly as much power as I would have thought.
well, there's got to be something else.
right, um...
all right, look, the ship has auxiliary power modules for most of the main systems.
most likely they're depleted, but if not, well, it might buy us a little more juice.
well, there you go.
what the hell was that? Was it gunfire?
Where's Ronon?
keep working.
stay focused, Rodney.
tell me what to do next. - All right.
you okay?
Yeah.
where the hell did he come from?
check it out.
it's the symbol that was on the alien ship.
how'd he get on board?
you know, they crashed into us, penetrated our hull, remember?
think he did it on purpose?
that's a good question.
Hey.
let me try that.
that's it. That's all of them.
I must go help Colonel Sheppard and Ronon. Good luck, Rodney.
no, no, no, no, no, it's not enough!
what do you mean?
without sublights, our orbit is decaying, which means more radiation slamming into the shields.
the alternate reality drive is only charged to 70% percent.
which means it'll never make 100 before the shields fail.
well, what do we do? We have no more power.
J-Just... give me a second.
Rodney, Colonel Sheppard and Ronon are under attack.
all right, I got it, I got it. Drop the shields.
what?
drop the shields, I will transfer all available power to the drive.
hopefully it'll be enough to induce a jump.
hopefully?
it is our only option, and every second we argue about it, is less of a chance it's going to work!
very well. Dropping shields.
hull temperature is passing critical.
okay, transferring power to the drive now.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
what is it? - It's not enough. It's only 98%!
Rodney, the hull is beginning to deteriorate.
come on, come on!
that's it! Sheppard, we're jumping!
nice work, Rodney.
uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.
now what?
I think I've overtaxed the drive.
look, it's not completely blown, but we've only a handful of jumps before it's burned out.
all right, then what happens?
what happened to the planet?
Rodney believes that in this reality, it was destroyed by an impact, possibly millions of years ago.
all that remains is this asteroid field.
all right, I think I got something.
I was just too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.
what are you talking about? - See, my mistake was focusing on the navigation system.
I should've known that was never going to work.
so, what, then?
so in spectacular feat of multi-dimensional mathematics, I've discovered a way to send the ship back along the path it's previously traveled bypassing the navigation system altogether.
wait a minute.
you're talking about putting this thing in reverse?
exactly.
I just suggested that two hours ago.
and naturally, I dismissed it out of hand, but then I realized that, including the original designer, not one, but two versions of myself have failed to make this thing work.
I had to think not like me.
I had to think the opposite of me. Doesn't get more opposite than you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
so can we get back or not?
well, not directly.
it's impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we are now, but we can retrace our steps, passing through each reality in turn until we reach the right one.
slight problem, Rodney.
we barely got out of those realities alive.
if we do no restore the shields, the radiation from the red giant will kill us.
not necessarily.
we let the ship carry us in its momentum in real space from one reality to the next.
now, we may not have sublight engines, but we do have maneuvering thrusters.
you know, one long continuous burn along the right trajectory, from now until the next jump should be enough to allow us to establish a higher, more stable orbit around the sun.
so the radiation will not affect us?
well, I wouldn't go that far, but still, it'll be... not quite as deadly?
okay. That's it.
course is already plotted.
what about those alien dudes? They're know we're the ones that shot at them.
maybe they'll be gone.
I wouldn't count on it.
time is passing at the same rate in each of the realities, which means...it hasn't been that long.
to get past those aliens, we're going to need sublight engines, and I'm going to need to fix them in time.
wait, wait, but you said you don't know what's wrong with those.
I haven't had a chance to check it out.
I can't do 10 things at once.
I already told you, the drive is going to burn out, soon.
we have to do something.
who's to say the next reality won't be even worse?
all right, all the modifications to the drive are in place.
here we go.
it worked. You did it, Rodney.
all right, I'm going to head up to engineering, get to work on the sublights.
what's our status?
hull temperature is rising, but not as rapidly as it did before. I think we'll be okay.
so much for the frying pan.
let's hope we make it through the fire.
how is it coming?
hmm? Ah, it's not good.
the main systems are completely fried. I'll have to do a full bypass.
Oh, jeez!
what the...
Thanks.
perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system might be useful.
uh, sure.
for what?
for not giving up.
Oh, I know what this is.
it's your first mission back.
I am not about to let it be your last, okay?
Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.
what is it?
the drive's charging a lot faster now.
looks like the next jump's going to happen a lot sooner than we thought.
how's it coming with the sublight engine?
I'm going to need a few minutes.
do we have a few more minutes?
all right, let's split rail gun positions. I'll take forward, you take after.
you really think that'll make a difference?
without shields, probably not, but we don't have much of a choice.
Where's the alien ship?
I'm not sure.
well, maybe they left.
no such luck. They're right behind us.
fighters, closing in on our position. How's it going down there?
look, just give me a second!
okay, try it now.
that's it, I've got it!
go, go, go, go, go, go!
how we doing?
they're gaining on us.
can you get us more speed?
there's not a chance! Look, I've barely got this thing working as it is!
if we tax it any more, we're going to blow the whole system!
then we've got a real problem.
they're in weapons range.
return fire. - I'm trying.
easy, chewie, those buttons are your friends.
just keep Trying - I'm trying!
that's it, sublights are gone for good this time!
what the hell was that?
F-302s.
it's Atlantis.
what's happening?
looks like we're getting some help from some friends.
guess we bet on the right side after all.
Daedalus , this is lt. Colonel John·Sheppard.
do you read?
Daedalus, do you read?
uh...
Yeah, Daedalus. Uh, this is Daedalus. Come in.
who... who is this?
it's a long story.
well, whoever you are, you saved our asses when you took out their main weapons.
I think at least we could do is to return the favor.
much appreciated.
uh, Sheppard...
Oh, crap.
sorry about that. One of 'em got through.
nice shooting, though.
Oh, thanks.
all right, looks like that's the last of them.
so, uh...
so, what happens now?
well, we go our own ways.
just like that?
well, the thing is, uh, we do have a few questions.
see, the Daedalus we know was destroyed two years ago in a battle with the replicators.
sorry to hear that, but this isn't exactly our Daedalus. We're just borrowing it for a while.
okay, I have no idea what that means.
like I said, it's a long story.
all right, Daedalus , good luck.
thank you, colonel, and one last thing, it's been a pleasure.
you're obviously a man of great integrity, and a dedicated commander, and a very skilled pilot.
well, that's funny. I was going to say the same to you.
all right.
the alien ship's gone. I'm reading a planet with no energy signatures.
it's the first reality we jumped to. One more, and we're home.
let's get down to the hangar bay.
I got shot!
I thought we got 'em all.
apparently not.
think there's any more of them?
we're not waiting around to find out.
move, move, move!
the explosion's caused a hull breech.
whole sections have been de-pressurized, including the hangar bay!
we just lost the jumpers!
our stop is coming up, Rodney. It's time to get off this train.
look, there's no way off.
once we jump into our own reality, Atlantis will detect us, and they will send help.
we broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember?
look, we carry our momentum and relative position in space from one reality to the next.
which means, by the time we next jump, we're going to be, like, half a million kilometers out.
they're never going to get to us in time!
we got C-4. We wait till we get back, then we blow the drive.
that could work, or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum not only killing us but destroying the entire solar system!
well, we'd better think of something fast.
another contact just appeared on our screens.
was it the Daedalus?
no, they're too far out for us to get I. F.F.
well, try subspace.
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne, do you read?
was there a hyperspace window?
no, sir. They just appeared out of nowhere.
well, it's got to be them.
alert Mr. Woolsey. Doc, you're with me. Let's go, come on.
all right, we should be within radio range.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
Dr. Mckay, this is Major Lorne. Do you read?
there's too much interference.
I'm picking up some kind of energy reading.
it's spiking.
what the hell just happened?
they disappeared.
what are you talking about?
well... they're just gone.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm picking up four lifesigns.
okay, where?
dead ahead.
Colonel sheppard, is that you?
major... nice of you to stop by.
kind of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood.
Yes, sir.
how many jumps you think that drive has left in it before it burns out?
half a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely inert.
good. I'd hate to think of somebody else getting trapped inside that thing like we did.
actually, you know, I've been thinking about that.
now, true, the navigation system was flawed to start, but the basic principles of the drive are fundamentally sound
forget it, Rodney. - I've saved the relevant data.
minor adjustments, and I should be able to have this thing up and running
I said forget it.
Hey, look who's here.
how's your shoulder, Rodney?
uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know, better, thanks.
is it well enough to hold him?
Really?
don't drop him.
thank you.
hey there, little guy.
I think he likes me.
it suits you.
you think so?
I think you'll make an excellent father someday.
I've seen a lot of scary things in my time, but that thought scares me the most.
do you want to, um...
I think so.
there you go, watch out...
right.
what are you talking about?
Oh yeah? Every time I go to see him, she tells me that he's just settled down.
can you blame her? You dropped him.
I did not drop him, he jumped.
jumped? - Well, he wiggled out of my arms.
I said I was sorry. Besides, how much damage could I possibly have done?
he fell, like, maybe two feet.
stuff like that happens all the time.
I mean, I was dropped like, a dozen times when I was a kid.
well, that explains a lot.
why do you even care? You don't even like kids. - It's the principle of the thing.
everybody else gets to hold him. Why shouldn't I?
Colonel...
we've got a new contact. Looks like a ship.
how far out?
it's in orbit.
well, how come we didn't detect it?
I don't know. We didn't even detect a hyperspace window.
it just appeared out of nowhere.
hang on a second, we're getting I. F.F.
it's the Daedalus.
the Daedalus? How can that be? They're on their way back to earth.
well, they were. They were supposed to be.
open up a channel.
Daedalus, this is Atlantis, please come in.
Daedalus, please respond.
they're not going to answer.
why not?
because I'm not reading any lifesigns.
what are you telling me, Rodney, this thing flew here by itself?
I don't know how they got here, but there's no one on board.
Colonel, we just got confirmation from stargate command.
the Daedalus is in the Milky Way, on course and on schedule.
the Daedalus Variations
they expect to reach earth within two days.
understood.
so that's not the Daedalus, then.
not unless it can be in two places at once.
perhaps the Apollo, or one of your other ships... - They wouldn't be sending daedalus I. F.F..
plus it doesn't explain how they got here, or why we're not picking up lifesign readings.
all right, I'm taking us in for a closer look.
wow, you see that?
Yeah, some scorch marks.
you think weapon's fire?
well, wherever she's been, she's been through some pretty hard times.
what's that?
I'm picking up an energy reading.
it's coming from the ship.
is it dangerous?
I don't think so, but I have no idea what's causing it.
can you get the bay doors open?
if the ship's command systems are as familiar as the rest of it, it shouldn't be a problem.
no F-302s, but there's a jumper.
you sure there's no one else inside?
as far as I can tell.
all right, we're going in.
why is it so cold in here?
the ship's operating on emergency power.
some of the systems are barely registering.
except for the whole weird energy thing.
that's right.
can you do something about it? It's freezing in here.
Oh, sure, I just have to get to engineering.
you and Ronon are together. Teyla, you and I are going to check out the bridge.
radio me if you find anything.
no bodies in here.
Colonel...
it's the Daedalus , all right.
McKay, is that you?
of course it was me. Who else would it be?
you think we've got a ghost on board or something?
will you please not touch anything!
what's our status?
I've restored basic power to most of the ship.
it should be warming up any second now.
good.
check on that energy reading. Try to figure out what it is, all right?
I'm on it.
Colonel...
ship's log, last entry.
preparations are almost complete.
we've beamed down the last of our supplies, and any equipment we think might be useful.
I'll be taking the last of the F-302s down myself.
of course, we haven't had time to do a proper survey of the planet's surface, but it seems habitable enough.
plenty of fresh water, arable soil, not that different from our own.
I realize our chance of rescue is slim, but it's become obvious that we no longer have a choice.
this is colonel Sobol, commander of the Daedalus , signing off.
do you recognize her?
I've never seen her before in my life.
well, it appears as if they abandoned ship.
Yeah. The question is, why?
I'll check previous entries.
man, this ship has been through the wringer.
no, hyperdrive, subspace communications are all damaged beyond repair, the shields are virtually depleted...
what is it?
it's the energy reading.
it's spiking.
Sheppard, come in.
go ahead.
something's happening. The energy reading, it's going off the charts.
do something. Turn it off.
I don't know how. Look, it's not coming from any of the main systems.
Colonel sheppard, this is Atlantis. We're picking up some kind of power surge coming from the ship.
Yeah, we noticed it. We're trying to check it out ourselves.
the levels are still rising.
Colonel, should we send another jumper to assist?
stand by.
all right, that's our cue to leave.
everyone, back in the jumper.
McKay, what the hell was that?
I have no idea, but the energy reading's gone back down the way it was.
Atlantis, you reading anything unusual?
Atlantis, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Colonel sheppard, do you read?
Daedalus , this is Atlantis, please respond.
what the hell's going on?
I don't know. One moment they were there, the next minute, they were gone.
I'm having problems with communications. I can't reach Atlantis.
wait a second.
that can't be right.
what?
I'm not seeing the city on any of my screens.
what are you talking about?
I just did a sensor sweep, and there's nothing down there but ocean.
well, maybe they cloaked.
well, they wouldn't have done that without telling us.
well, I don't know, maybe there's a wraith ship in the area.
I'm not reading anything.
are we certain it's the same planet?
perhaps the energy burst shifted our position.
no, according to our instruments, we haven't moved at all.
what do you want me to believe, Rodney?
that Atlantis just disappeared?
look, I don't know. Just give me a second, I'll figure it out, all right?
in the meantime, I've managed to localize the source of the energy reading.
it's coming from a hold on deck 9.
all right, keep trying to reach Atlantis. We'll check it out.
Sheppard, I think I've got something.
it's the residual radiation from the flash.
it's similar to what happens when you open a hyperspace window, but different enough that the sensors wouldn't have picked it up automatically.
what the hell does that mean?
I think we're looking at a new kind of drive.
I thought you said we didn't go anywhere.
we didn'T. At least not according to the ship's navigational systems.
so, a malfunctioning drive?
maybe. Just hang on.
Oh, my god, Sheppard. - Stand by, Rodney.
no, you don't understand, I know what it is.
look, the residual radiation.
it's exactly what we recorded when my double arrived on Atlantis from an alternate reality.
I can't believe I didn't see this before.
Sheppard, hey.
it's a drive all right, but it didn't move us through space.
I think it's moved us into a parallel universe.
that would explain a lot of things.
how long have they been dead for?
this place was like a meat locker.
they could've been preserved like this for months.
they look just like us.
that's because they are us, the alternate reality versions of us.
I feel like someone just walked over my grave.
take it easy. Everything's fine.
Oh, no, no, no, this is very bad.
this tablet belonged to the other Mckay.
they weren't part of the original crew. They came here just like us.
look, a ship appeared in orbit above their Atlantis, they came to check it out.
that would explain the other jumper in the bay.
the ship jumped to another reality, and they were stuck, they couldn't get back.
look, eventually their supplies ran out, and they...
all right, all right, mystery solved. Let's move on.
don't you realize what this means?
they were us, and they failed.
well, they're not us. We're still alive. Let's go.
the answer's in here somewhere.
can you power up the systems?
Yeah, just hold on.
all right, that's a start.
what's behind here?
that's a good question.
I'm guessing that's our alternate reality drive.
can you figure out how to control it?
offhand, I'd say no.
that's what the other Mckay was trying to do, and he had weeks.
fine.
I'll start with his research.
it'll at least give us a head start.
that's better. We're going to go look or supplies.
you don't think the other us wouldn't have already tried that? - Get to work.
did you find anything?
not unless you know a way to cook this.
perhaps we should consider going down to the planet to collect supplies.
Sheppard says it's too risky.
the drive could kick in, and the ship could take off without us.
then we'd be stuck here.
the others that we found...
do you think their lives were very similar to ours?
who cares?
how can you say that?
we've seen our doubles before.
Replicator-manufactured copies.
I can't help but wondering who might still be waiting for her back on her Atlantis.
do you mean, did she also have a son?
the thought had crossed my mind.
look...
I've heard Mckay talk about this stuff before, and supposedly,
which also means there's a million different Torrens.
you going to worry about every one of them?
no.
it's difficult enough worrying about one.
I'll bet it is.
come on.
why is the blast door closed?
Oh, right.
have you made any progress?
we?
me and the other Mckay, who, unsurprisingly, is a genius.
not only that, but it looks like the drive was created by yet another Mckay from the original reality.
what makes you say that?
well, there's a certain, um, elegance to the design that I recognize.
I'm sure that's what the crew was saying when they abandoned ship.
well, admittedly there are problems, but it is still a monumental achievement.
all right.
so, what do we do?
can we just throw this thing in reverse?
uh, yeah, it's a little more complicated than that.
the first problem is navigation.
they've developed a coordinate system to identify the various realities and allow them to get back, but obviously that didn't work.
obviously.
that's not what bothers me.
it's power generation, and jumping from one reality to another requires massive amounts of power.
we're talking ZPM levels here.
obviously they didn't have one of those rattling around, so they created a capacitor that's constantly drawing power from subspace.
and it looks like it's almost charged.
is this your long-winded way of telling me you just can't turn it off?
think of it like a tap, pouring water into a bucket.
when the bucket is full, the drive engages, except this particular tap has no valve.
that seems like a pretty serious design flaw, don't you think?
exactly.
which leads me to believe they were tampering with it, in a vain attempt to generate more power.
as they got further and further from their own reality,
I guess they figured they'd need it to get back.
and here we go.
okay.
where are we?
Oh, don't look at me.
I haven't had time to route the main systems to these control panels.
I'm flying blind down here.
Ronon, Teyla, meet me at the bridge.
on our way.
keep it up, Rodney.
Colonel, Atlantis is back.
I'm picking them up on the sensors.
you know how to work this stuff?
I was busy.
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
Atlantis, do you read?
Atlantis, this is sheppard, come in.
maybe they already have a Sheppard.
what are the odds of us randomly jumping back into our own reality?
I'd say slim to none.
I'm detecting another ship in orbit.
what kind?
I'll see if I can pull it up on screen.
I don't recognize it.
what's that?
you know it?
no.
Colonel, I believe the ship is powering weapons.
what's our shield status?
minimal.
it's firing on Atlantis.
the city's shields are failing.
Rodney, do we have enough juice to power up the Asgard beam?
maybe. You might be able to get a couple of shots off.
Why?
there's some alien ship attacking Atlantis.
so?
what do you mean, "so?" It's Atlantis!
it's not our Atlantis.
we have no idea who's down there. Look, we should just stay out of it.
if we do not intervene, the city will be destroyed.
Yeah, we need help.
my gut tells me we're better off going with the people on that planet than whoever's on that ship.
I hope you're right.
Yeah, well, me too.
the ship's been damaged. It's stopped firing.
hopefully we took out its main weapons.
wait, something's happening.
they're launching fighters.
you should've took marks up when you had the chance. Now you'll have to learn fast.
Rail-gun targeting systems.
button's on the right. Control, radar, tracking, and target acquisition, use the red button to fire.
what the hell was that?
we're under attack. Any chance of getting that hyperdrive back online?
great.
there's too many of them. I can't do this. - Keep trying!
we've lost sublight.
we have a hull breach.
we're venting atmosphere. I don't know what to do.
seal off damaged areas. We should be okay for the moment.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Sheppard, I have an idea!
let's hear it.
I've set up a few protocols that should increase the efficiency of the alternate reality drive.
drive if I enable them, we might be able jump sooner.
what, jump to the next universe?
Exactly!
but if I do this, I can't undo it!
I mean, we'll just start jumping faster and faster!
do it.
it worked.
where are we?
we have a problem.
temperature in the hull is rising rapidly.
what the hell is this?
according to these readings, we're less than two million kilometers from the surface of the sun.
I thought we always jumped to the same place in every reality.
as did I.
hull temperature is approaching critical.
if we do not restore shields, we're going to burn.
are you sure about this?
well, we're not imagining it, Rodney.
let me transfer the sensors down to the station. Then at least I can...
Ooh...
well, you're definitely not imagining that.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
I don't understand it. We always jump to the same relative position in space.
unless...
unless what?
you said when you went to the future, you saw our sun expanding into a red giant, remember?
what are you saying, we're jumping through time now?
no, no, no, no, no, but maybe what eventually happens in our reality is happening in this one, only much sooner.
we didn't go to the sun. The sun came to us.
so how does this help us?
I-I don't know.
I just, I found it interesting.
what's interesting, Rodney, is a way out of this without getting fried, like getting sublight back on, so we can get the hell out of here.
actually, I think our best bet is just to transfer as much power as we can to the shields, and ride it out till the next jump.
when does that happen?
well, the time the capacitor takes to charge is different now that I've enacted those new protocols.
you know, um...
I have no idea.
you're not exactly selling the plan, Rodney.
I have no idea how long it would take me to fix the sublights either!
look, I've got to run a diagnostic, but theoretically, transferring power to the shields should be relatively easy.
all right, what do we do?
the first I need you to do is head down to engineering.
let's go.
all right, we're here. What do we do?
you need to kill all power to non-essential decks.
which means you're going to have to access the main administrative interface.
that should bring up a list of all available override commands.
got it.
okay.
so choose the command for life support.
you'll have to designate the decks one by one.
I think that's all of them.
dammit.
that didn't buy us nearly as much power as I would have thought.
well, there's got to be something else.
right, um...
all right, look, the ship has auxiliary power modules for most of the main systems.
most likely they're depleted, but if not, well, it might buy us a little more juice.
well, there you go.
what the hell was that? Was it gunfire?
Where's Ronon?
keep working.
stay focused, Rodney.
tell me what to do next. - All right.
you okay?
Yeah.
where the hell did he come from?
check it out.
it's the symbol that was on the alien ship.
how'd he get on board?
you know, they crashed into us, penetrated our hull, remember?
think he did it on purpose?
that's a good question.
Hey.
let me try that.
that's it. That's all of them.
I must go help Colonel Sheppard and Ronon. Good luck, Rodney.
no, no, no, no, no, it's not enough!
what do you mean?
without sublights, our orbit is decaying, which means more radiation slamming into the shields.
the alternate reality drive is only charged to 70% percent.
which means it'll never make 100 before the shields fail.
well, what do we do? We have no more power.
J-Just... give me a second.
Rodney, Colonel Sheppard and Ronon are under attack.
all right, I got it, I got it. Drop the shields.
what?
drop the shields, I will transfer all available power to the drive.
hopefully it'll be enough to induce a jump.
hopefully?
it is our only option, and every second we argue about it, is less of a chance it's going to work!
very well. Dropping shields.
hull temperature is passing critical.
okay, transferring power to the drive now.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
what is it? - It's not enough. It's only 98%!
Rodney, the hull is beginning to deteriorate.
come on, come on!
that's it! Sheppard, we're jumping!
nice work, Rodney.
uh, you may want to hold off on the congratulations.
now what?
I think I've overtaxed the drive.
look, it's not completely blown, but we've only a handful of jumps before it's burned out.
all right, then what happens?
what happened to the planet?
Rodney believes that in this reality, it was destroyed by an impact, possibly millions of years ago.
all that remains is this asteroid field.
all right, I think I got something.
I was just too busy trying to avoid imminent death to notice it.
what are you talking about? - See, my mistake was focusing on the navigation system.
I should've known that was never going to work.
so, what, then?
so in spectacular feat of multi-dimensional mathematics, I've discovered a way to send the ship back along the path it's previously traveled bypassing the navigation system altogether.
wait a minute.
you're talking about putting this thing in reverse?
exactly.
I just suggested that two hours ago.
and naturally, I dismissed it out of hand, but then I realized that, including the original designer, not one, but two versions of myself have failed to make this thing work.
I had to think not like me.
I had to think the opposite of me. Doesn't get more opposite than you.
I'll take that as a compliment.
so can we get back or not?
well, not directly.
it's impossible to calculate the relative position of our original starting point from where we are now, but we can retrace our steps, passing through each reality in turn until we reach the right one.
slight problem, Rodney.
we barely got out of those realities alive.
if we do no restore the shields, the radiation from the red giant will kill us.
not necessarily.
we let the ship carry us in its momentum in real space from one reality to the next.
now, we may not have sublight engines, but we do have maneuvering thrusters.
you know, one long continuous burn along the right trajectory, from now until the next jump should be enough to allow us to establish a higher, more stable orbit around the sun.
so the radiation will not affect us?
well, I wouldn't go that far, but still, it'll be... not quite as deadly?
okay. That's it.
course is already plotted.
what about those alien dudes? They're know we're the ones that shot at them.
maybe they'll be gone.
I wouldn't count on it.
time is passing at the same rate in each of the realities, which means...it hasn't been that long.
to get past those aliens, we're going to need sublight engines, and I'm going to need to fix them in time.
wait, wait, but you said you don't know what's wrong with those.
I haven't had a chance to check it out.
I can't do 10 things at once.
I already told you, the drive is going to burn out, soon.
we have to do something.
who's to say the next reality won't be even worse?
all right, all the modifications to the drive are in place.
here we go.
it worked. You did it, Rodney.
all right, I'm going to head up to engineering, get to work on the sublights.
what's our status?
hull temperature is rising, but not as rapidly as it did before. I think we'll be okay.
so much for the frying pan.
let's hope we make it through the fire.
how is it coming?
hmm? Ah, it's not good.
the main systems are completely fried. I'll have to do a full bypass.
Oh, jeez!
what the...
Thanks.
perhaps a separate diagnostic of the auxiliary system might be useful.
uh, sure.
for what?
for not giving up.
Oh, I know what this is.
it's your first mission back.
I am not about to let it be your last, okay?
Oh, no, that's what I was afraid of.
what is it?
the drive's charging a lot faster now.
looks like the next jump's going to happen a lot sooner than we thought.
how's it coming with the sublight engine?
I'm going to need a few minutes.
do we have a few more minutes?
all right, let's split rail gun positions. I'll take forward, you take after.
you really think that'll make a difference?
without shields, probably not, but we don't have much of a choice.
Where's the alien ship?
I'm not sure.
well, maybe they left.
no such luck. They're right behind us.
fighters, closing in on our position. How's it going down there?
look, just give me a second!
okay, try it now.
that's it, I've got it!
go, go, go, go, go, go!
how we doing?
they're gaining on us.
can you get us more speed?
there's not a chance! Look, I've barely got this thing working as it is!
if we tax it any more, we're going to blow the whole system!
then we've got a real problem.
they're in weapons range.
return fire. - I'm trying.
easy, chewie, those buttons are your friends.
just keep Trying - I'm trying!
that's it, sublights are gone for good this time!
what the hell was that?
F-302s.
it's Atlantis.
what's happening?
looks like we're getting some help from some friends.
guess we bet on the right side after all.
Daedalus , this is lt. Colonel John·Sheppard.
do you read?
Daedalus, do you read?
uh...
Yeah, Daedalus. Uh, this is Daedalus. Come in.
who... who is this?
it's a long story.
well, whoever you are, you saved our asses when you took out their main weapons.
I think at least we could do is to return the favor.
much appreciated.
uh, Sheppard...
Oh, crap.
sorry about that. One of 'em got through.
nice shooting, though.
Oh, thanks.
all right, looks like that's the last of them.
so, uh...
so, what happens now?
well, we go our own ways.
just like that?
well, the thing is, uh, we do have a few questions.
see, the Daedalus we know was destroyed two years ago in a battle with the replicators.
sorry to hear that, but this isn't exactly our Daedalus. We're just borrowing it for a while.
okay, I have no idea what that means.
like I said, it's a long story.
all right, Daedalus , good luck.
thank you, colonel, and one last thing, it's been a pleasure.
you're obviously a man of great integrity, and a dedicated commander, and a very skilled pilot.
well, that's funny. I was going to say the same to you.
all right.
the alien ship's gone. I'm reading a planet with no energy signatures.
it's the first reality we jumped to. One more, and we're home.
let's get down to the hangar bay.
I got shot!
I thought we got 'em all.
apparently not.
think there's any more of them?
we're not waiting around to find out.
move, move, move!
the explosion's caused a hull breech.
whole sections have been de-pressurized, including the hangar bay!
we just lost the jumpers!
our stop is coming up, Rodney. It's time to get off this train.
look, there's no way off.
once we jump into our own reality, Atlantis will detect us, and they will send help.
we broke orbit to get away from the fighters, remember?
look, we carry our momentum and relative position in space from one reality to the next.
which means, by the time we next jump, we're going to be, like, half a million kilometers out.
they're never going to get to us in time!
we got C-4. We wait till we get back, then we blow the drive.
that could work, or it could tear a hole in the space-time continuum not only killing us but destroying the entire solar system!
well, we'd better think of something fast.
another contact just appeared on our screens.
was it the Daedalus?
no, they're too far out for us to get I. F.F.
well, try subspace.
Colonel Sheppard, do you read?
Colonel Sheppard, this is Major Lorne, do you read?
was there a hyperspace window?
no, sir. They just appeared out of nowhere.
well, it's got to be them.
alert Mr. Woolsey. Doc, you're with me. Let's go, come on.
all right, we should be within radio range.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
Dr. Mckay, this is Major Lorne. Do you read?
there's too much interference.
I'm picking up some kind of energy reading.
it's spiking.
what the hell just happened?
they disappeared.
what are you talking about?
well... they're just gone.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm picking up four lifesigns.
okay, where?
dead ahead.
Colonel sheppard, is that you?
major... nice of you to stop by.
kind of hard to get a cab in this neighborhood.
Yes, sir.
how many jumps you think that drive has left in it before it burns out?
half a dozen, tops. Then it'll be completely inert.
good. I'd hate to think of somebody else getting trapped inside that thing like we did.
actually, you know, I've been thinking about that.
now, true, the navigation system was flawed to start, but the basic principles of the drive are fundamentally sound
forget it, Rodney. - I've saved the relevant data.
minor adjustments, and I should be able to have this thing up and running
I said forget it.
Hey, look who's here.
how's your shoulder, Rodney?
uh, it's pretty bad, but, you know, better, thanks.
is it well enough to hold him?
Really?
don't drop him.
thank you.
hey there, little guy.
I think he likes me.
it suits you.
you think so?
I think you'll make an excellent father someday.
I've seen a lot of scary things in my time, but that thought scares me the most.
do you want to, um...
I think so.
there you go, watch out...
right.
it just appeared out of nowhere.
and that shriek scared the crap out of me.
kind of a...flying monkey.
flying monkeys! What is this, the planet of Oz?
did it not appear to be leaping rather than flying?
that was one hell of a leap.
well, I said it looked like a monkey?
you know, hair, arms, legs... - and a beak.
it didn't have a beak!
look, here? I uploaded it.
there.
you know, that really clears things up - What did you expect?
it was trying to kill me. - What the hell is that thing?
well, let's send a team of biologists down there let them figure it out.
it might be a good place for an Alpha site.
the planet did seem suitable.
good climate; abundant food and water; excellent choice for an offworld base.
aside from the flying monkeys!
all right, we're coming into range, Rodney.
Oh, serious power spike!
that's strange.
what's wrong?
I don't know.
I mean, these readings are all screwy.
I just lost steering. - Really?
the drive pods won't retract.
do something.
I could if I knew what the problem was.
Just-just-just hang on, hang on.
Yeah, but if those pods don't retract... - I know, I know!
just-just give me a second. - We don't have a second.
what the hell?
we just lost power.
all right, you'd better hold on.
OK, good, good.
I was wrong.
we still have power; we're just not getting any to the primary systems...
or the secondary systems either.
why not? - I don't know. It's some kind of interference.
ghost in the Machine
I'm getting spikes all over the place.
it's completely haywire.
thank God the inertial dampeners weren't affected.
well, not yet.
what the hell is that?
it's displacement current high voltage. Do not let it hit you.
Oh, you think?
perhaps it's something we picked up on the planet.
that is doubtful, OK?
there was nothing technological
I mean Ancient or other on that planet. It was totally primordial.
I didn't detect anything unusual in the planet's magnetosphere.
look, it's gotta be some kind of a of a glitch in the Jumper's capacitor.
just give me a second, I'll figure out how to...
Oh no.
what?
hitting the Gate decreased our speed, which means we're in decaying orbit.
look, if we don't get power back, we're gonna burn up in the atmosphere.
all right, try to get the D. H.D. working, we can dial the Gate, radio for help.
well, I'll try, but the radio communications were affected as well.
the drive pods are powering up.
only one of them, and it wasn't anything I did.
I mean, it just came back online.
by itself? - It doesn't make any difference.
keep working on that D. H.D. I'm gonna and get us back in range.
OK, I've got bad news and I've got good news.
what is it?
slim to no chance of getting the D. H.D. working.
the system is completely out of whack.
it's gonna take some incredibly intricate rerouting to the power...
whoa-whoa-whoa. What's the good news?
that was the good news. The bad news is we lost life support.
so, no air.
right. That's-that's why it's bad.
all right. We're back in range.
just keep working on the D. H.D. This may be our last shot.
what just happened?
I don't know, but we're back online.
D. H.D?
everything! We've got propulsion, life support, you name it.
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
we're coming in for approach but our systems are a little whacked.
if we're not there in about ten seconds send a Jumper for us.
copy that, Colonel.
you'd better brace yourself again.
any of the other Jumpers reporting trouble?
no. Probably an isolated incident but McKay and Zelenka are checking into it.
we should probably ground the Jumpers 'til we know what the problem is, though.
all right.
but the planet suitable for an Alpha site?
Yeah, perfect well, except for the monkey-like creature flying around, - but I think we can handle that. - Monkey?
Yeah. McKay's got some photos, he'll show them to you.
did you say "flying"?
so, how's it going, boys? Don't you get it fixed?
there's nothing to fix. - What?
we ran a battery of tests. The Jumper's in perfect condition.
how come the systems were all screwy?
you got me.
we couldn't recreate any of the so-called anomalies.
Hey, Sammy Sceptic.
he saw it too, as did Ronon and Teyla. All of our primary systems went down.
that's OK. I believe you.
I don't think you do.
it's just that I think that maybe the problem might have been caused by something that you unwittingly...
I didn't do anything ? wittingly or "un"!
OK, OK. There's nothing wrong with the Jumper.
well, not any more!
well, I don't think there ever was anything... - OK, enough!
Oh, please!
control Room, this is Richard Woolsey.
I took a wrong turn in a transporter and ended up...
I have no idea where I am.
but now the transporter door won't open.
can you locate me and open it, please?
Hello?
go ahead.
are you messin' around with the power again? The lights are flickering.
Yeah, I'm getting reports from all over the place...
Hello?
have you noticed... - Yes.
well, do you have any... - Not yet.
is it localised - No. There are power disruptions all over the city.
ZedP. M? - Still online, plenty of power.
it's just suddenly become...
unstable.
sounds not unlike what you said happened in the Puddle Jumper.
Yes, remarkably not unlike it.
well, perhaps the anomaly's spread to the city's systems.
Naah, it's impossible.
I disabled the network connection between the Jumper and Atlantis before we even came through the Gate.
so.
coincidence, then?
Hey, I tried to radio you.
Yeah, communications are down.
Yeah, obviously. What's up?
we're working on it.
well, I just almost got zapped by a bolt of lightning.
what, displacement current here?
Yeah, right there in the corridor, just like the one we had in the Jumper.
so, not a coincidence.
we just lost power to the Stargate.
what?
maybe a virus uploaded itself or something.
no-no, I disabled the Jumper's network connection for this very reason.
there is no way the anomaly jumped to the city's systems.
you'd better figure it out, because whatever was in that Jumper is now in the city.
Where've you been?
on the other side of the city.
a transporter malfunctioned and sent me to the East Pier.
I had to walk all the way back.
we've got power disruptions all over the city.
look, nearly every system's affected.
we think whatever's wrong with the Jumper has infected Atlantis.
it's one of several possibilities we're looking into.
several?
it's a possibility, all right?
look, the point is, we have no idea what's going on here.
I was almost hit by a bolt of lightning.
Yeah, join the club!
look, the energy builds up in one area and then discharges in a high-voltage displacement current.
very erratic, and very lethal.
I tried to radio you.
Yeah, well, communications are also down.
so's the Stargate.
we can't dial Earth?
don't worry, all right?
I will figure it out. I've just gotta run a few diagnostics, narrow down the...
well, that can't be good.
OK, OK.
we need to organise some teams, fan out through the city, keep everyone calm until we figure out exactly what the...
hey the laptop just booted up.
it's probably just the battery.
No-no-no-no, it's drawing power from the system.
so everything's out except your computer?
I am as confused as you are.
what is that?
looks like some kind of a code.
maybe.
could be a message.
help?
who are you?
doctor Weir?
but she's dead.
so we've been told.
perhaps you should answer her.
right.
where are you?
computer
in the computer? How can she be in the computer?
difficult current condition
what happened to you?
subspace
difficult control
trying to
did you do that ?
are you still there?
help me
right. Rodney?
Rodney, come in.
Rodney, can you hear me?
go ahead.
I've completed the patch.
go ahead and try it whenever you're ready.
OK. Fingers crossed.
what are you doing?
well, whatever this entity is, it's completely overwhelming the city's systems.
now, it's spread out.
it's like dozens of fragmented programmes that are fouling up power management, communications you name it.
now, I've managed to merge them, to patch them together into one incredibly large programme that will hopefully render our systems slightly more stable and allow us to better communicate with whoever or...
whatever is that's claiming to be Doctor Weir.
isn't merging all these programmes potentially dangerous?
well, hell, yeah!
but it's no more dangerous than allowing this thing to continue wreaking havoc on the city's systems.
or getting zapped by bolts of lighting.
OK, so...
let me see if I can synthesise a voice to communicate with "Elizabeth."
if I make the proper calibrations, she should be able to hear us too.
now...
is it just me, or does "Elizabeth" sound a little different?
I'm on it. I'm on it.
Let...me...do...that...
are you Elizabeth Weir?
Yes, Rodney. It's me.
it's the best I can do.
I'm sorry to cause all this trouble.
who's there with you?
is John Sheppard there?
Hi.
it's so good to hear your voice again.
we, uh...
thought you were...
dead.
I suppose I am, my... my physical body, anyway, but my consciousness is still intact.
right. So, um, what happened?
do you remember the day I ordered you to leave me behind?
come on!
go!
Yeah, I remember.
well, after that, the Replicators took me to a lab.
the nanites in my body were unleashed and allowed to replicate.
I joined the population.
but even in my new form, my original consciousness was still there.
I was still me.
I tried to hide it but a few of the others could sense it.
they were remnants of Niam's old group.
I believe you encountered some of their handiwork
Replicator-built human versions of me and your team.
hmm. You heard about that, did you?
only after they were killed.
now, the other you, the human one
she thought you'd been destroyed.
that's what the leaders of our group wanted her to believe.
they kept us apart deliberately for security reasons.
this is all very interesting, I'm sure, but none of it explains how you've come to be a disembodied voice in our computer system.
is that Richard Woolsey?
uh, yes.
uh, I'm the, uh, the-the - the new... - The new you.
I see.
so, what-what... what happened? How did you...
end up... in there?
we were on the run.
Oberoth and the others were hunting us down for our heretical beliefs.
it was only a matter of time before we'd be captured and destroyed, unless something miraculous happened.
and something did.
our intel was correct. The planet has been completely destroyed.
can you detect any trace Replicator cells?
negative. They've been completely wiped out.
good.
we can finally get to work without having to look over our shoulders.
it's time to begin.
uh, well, that wasn't a miracle that was us.
we destroyed the Replicator homeworld.
I know, and we owe you a debt of gratitude because it allowed us to pursue our goal in peace.
you mean ascension?
exactly, Teyla.
we found a suitable planet and began our work.
I did what I could to help them.
I tried to lead them in meditation to teach them how to release their burden.
but it was difficult.
let me guess. You ran into the small hiccup of the fact that you're all machines.
Yes.
well, much as I'd like to say we didn't see that coming, we...
you know, did.
one of our group, Koracen, argued that it was a mistake to try and run away from our technological origin that we should embrace it and find a technological solution.
we know that a Replicator mind can be digitised and transferred from one body to another, but I've discovered a way that will allow us to exist indefinitely as fields of energy, effectively uploading ourselves into sub-space where we'll be free to move about the galaxy unencumbered by physical existence.
what will happen to our bodies?
the nanite bonds holding them together will be severed.
you mean they'll be destroyed. - Yes but we'll no longer need them.
Koracen, if this doesn't work... - It will work.
you told us that ascension is achieved when the physical body is transformed into pure energy.
I can make that happen for us.
once in sub-space, nothing can prevent us from continuing on to the next plane of existence.
are you ready?
it's done.
machine ascension!
except it didn't work.
there was no next step no ascension in any meaningful sense of the word.
we've been stuck in sub-space ever since.
what is it like?
Oh.
constant motion and deafening noise.
it's like the worst migraine you could possibly imagine.
I don't know. I've had some pretty horrendous migraines in my time.
we started searching the galaxy, looking for a way to regain any kind of physical form.
we came across a few other technologically advanced societies.
Really? In this galaxy?
you'd be surprised how many more are out there, keeping themselves hidden from the Wraith.
we occupied various computer systems even Wraith tech for a short while.
wraith tech? - Really?
it was extremely unpleasant.
in fact, no matter where we looked, we couldn't find any technology that would allow us to exist as anything even remotely like what we were before.
which is why you came here.
you knew that Atlantis' computers were big enough and powerful enough to house your entire programme.
the others were growing increasingly frustrated and bitter.
I broke away from them and started looking for you on my own.
I searched the galaxy for months, then I detected your Puddle Jumper and connected with it.
nearly killing us in the process.
I'm sorry for that.
my current condition is extremely volatile difficult to control, especially during the initial moments trying to interface with new tech.
but I didn't know where else to turn.
you're the only friends I have.
if you ask me, it's a trick someone just pretending to be Doctor Weir.
but what if it is her?
look, we still have the Ancient machine I used to build FRAN.
I can easily build another Replicator to house... - No!
I'd put in failsafes, a kill switch.
look, what I'm saying is that with all of the advancements I've been able to make...
with all due respects to the advancements you've made, one thing remains constant:
replicators are far too powerful to even think about trusting them.
they've been the scourge of two galaxies.
you know better than anyone how difficult it was to get rid of them.
then what should we do with her?
she can't stay where she is.
she's frying the city's computers.
well, maybe we can upload her, or it, or whatever this thing is into a virtual reality like we did with Ava.
that could work, but it wouldn't be easy, especially if she doesn't wanna go.
well, talk to her.
Rodney, we've just detected anomalous energy levels in the South Pier lab.
what, the Replicator machine?
she's building herself a body.
she must have found it in the database.
shut down power. - I-I tried.
I've also tried to radio down there but communications are still offline.
what's going on?
doors slammed shut.
can't get it open. - OK, move.
go get some back-up, some heavy arms;
and clear every corridor out of here.
and get some C4, we're gonna have to blast this door.
Yeah, this panel is toast.
is there another door we can access?
hello.
listen to me.
I'm Elizabeth Weir.
obviously she was in a hurry.
she just used the previous Replicator template that was already in the machine...
which was FRAN.
John, I'm not a threat to you.
well, whatever you are, I'd say building a Replicator body's a pretty big threat.
Elizabeth Weir would never do such a thing.
OK, the machine is deactivated.
I've removed the control crystal, which means no one will be building any more Replicators.
believe me,
I was just as concerned about doing this as you, but the adjustments Rodney's made to this technology eliminate any danger.
I can't replicate, and since my consciousness is controlling this body I truly...
your consciousness?
no offence, but I'm not completely sold on your being who you say you are.
that makes two of us.
I understand your scepticism, but I am Elizabeth Weir.
I wish there was some way I could prove it to you.
that'll be difficult.
any personal information or memories could have easily been mined from Doctor Weir's consciousness when the Replicators captured her.
I know.
at least let me start by offering something of value.
let's hear it.
the technical specs of several of the systems we've inhabited since our transformation, including Wraith tech.
I've already uploaded them to your computer.
Oh, really?
well, that's... great.
all I ask is that you give me a chance to earn your trust.
I would never ever do anything to harm any of you, or Atlantis.
well, the good news is that now she's downloaded herself into the Replicator's body she's not screwing up Atlantis' computers.
power's stable, the Gate's working and communications are back online.
you sure she can't replicate on her own?
positive. I mean, she instituted every safeguard.
if we move her to a secure location, then I think we'll be able... - Wait a minute.
you're not suggesting I entertain the notion of keeping her here?
well, I'm just saying that if we keep her under constant guard, it'll minimise any threat she poses if she even poses a threat and it'll give us more time to study her.
that thing in there is a Replicator.
there are far too many ways this can go wrong, even if she's kept under constant guard.
everyone doubted the first FRAN I built, and she turned out to be perfectly safe and perfectly reliable.
that's right, you built FRAN;
you created her consciousness.
now, as much as you wanna believe that this new FRAN is indeed Doctor Weir, we cannot be certain of that.
for all we know, it could be Oberoth inside that body.
that's creepy.
what if it is Doctor Weir?
look, this is my fault.
I'm the one who reactivated the nanites in Elizabeth true, to save her, but...
look, I'm the one who created this mess.
I think I should be the one to, you know, fix it.
I owe it to Elizabeth.
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.
I say we stick with our original plan:
upload her consciousness into a virtual reality, let her prove herself there, where she can't do any damage.
a child?
Oh, Teyla!
I'm so happy for you.
is it a boy or a...
a boy.
what's his name?
torren for your father, and John
Colonel Sheppard.
Yes.
wait. You're not saying John Sheppard is...
no.
no.
the father is Athosian.
let me guess
kanaan.
Yes! How did you...?
every time you spoke of him, this friend there was always a sparkle in your eyes.
so is the baby here with you in Atlantis?
no.
he's with his father, offworld.
sorry to interrupt.
that's all right.
we were just finishing.
sorry about all this.
it's OK. I understand.
amazing news about Teyla.
Yeah.
Yeah.
um, look, we all wanna believe you are who you say you are...
I understand.
you have to be cautious.
but it really is me, John.
you just have to give me time.
you'll see that...
Oh no.
what's wrong?
they've found me.
who?
the other Replicators.
they're on their way to Atlantis.
how many are coming?
eight of them.
we saw what kind of damage one could do.
should we pull the ZeeP. M?
as a last resort. We're not there yet.
meanwhile I'll need to effect any potential countermeasures I can come up with.
how soon will they get here?
minutes, if that.
is there anything we can do to protect the city?
could you put up some kind of firewall?
a firewall won't work. You can't block 'em.
they just pop in and out of sub-space.
they're here; they're there, it's impossible to predict.
I could write a programme that immediately quarantines any anomalous behaviour in the system, like an anti-virus software.
it's gonna take some time, though.
do what you can.
keep FRAN, Doctor Weir, whoever she is, under guard.
we won't upload her to the V. R. just yet.
we may need her help dealing with them.
you set us up. - No.
I honestly believed I had broken away without them being able to track me.
you tell them to stay away from Atlantis.
I'll try, but it'll get easier as they get closer.
look, I'm sure they don't intend to hurt anyone.
no, you tell them to keep moving; go someplace else.
it might go...
go ahead, Rodney.
their combined forces are completely overwhelming the main power grid.
they're here.
all eight of them, slamming the city's computers.
what about the anti-virus programme?
I didn't have time to finish it.
look, it probably wouldn't have worked anyway.
Radek, I need you to pull the ZedP. M. and power down all the central naqahdah generators.
communications are down again!
Rodney, I'm trying to divert power but it's become far too unstable.
perhaps now we should pull the ZedP. M?
let's go. Pull the ZedP. M.
shut down all the power except for the main tower.
Hey.
Oh God. He's dead.
we've established contact with the Replicator known as Koracen.
he claims to speak on the others' behalf.
Koracen, it's Elizabeth Weir.
Elizabeth. We were worried about you.
listen to me.
you need to leave this place.
you're causing a lot of harm.
we will do.
but first we wish to be given bodies, as you have.
we've already told you that's out of the question.
and yet Elizabeth has been given one.
it wasn't our choice, and we're not planning on letting her keep it.
we do not wish to harm anyone.
one of our guys is already dead, so you can save your "we come in peace" crap.
Koracen, please.
just leave the city and let me negotiate with them.
I'm sure we can figure out some way to help you.
the way to help us is by replacing the control crystal in the Ancient machine so that we may build Replicator bodies.
that is what you will do.
and if we don't?
not good.
not good.
uh, Gate's down again.
we're losing control of the city.
they just shut the Jumper Bay doors.
they're trying to keep us from leaving.
can't you over-ride it?
I'm locked out!
Oh no.
they just engaged the ZedP. M.
energy levels are rising rapidly.
Why? What are they doing?
they're sinking the city!
raise the shield.
they've disabled it.
any ideas?
no. We're goin' down.
the water's already cresting the lower decks of the outer piers.
it's gonna breach the city corridors any second now.
I want you to send them a message from me.
I've been trying to communicate with them, telling them to stop.
they won't listen to me.
that's not what I wanna tell them.
is it not?
tell them to go ahead.
sink the city.
destroy their only chance of ever regaining any kind of physical form.
you've searched the entire galaxy.
you know the Replicator homeworld was destroyed.
the only place remaining with the technology you need achieve your goals is right here.
so go ahead: destroy it.
stay trapped in limbo forever.
level one of the South Pier is completely under water.
they won't stop.
fine.
then we'll all die together.
they're powering down the ZedP. M!
the city's stabilising!
all right.
now we can negotiate.
I have a proposal.
I've already communicated it to the others and convinced them to agree to it.
let's hear it.
human bodies nanite-manufactured but consisting of flesh and blood, like the other Elizabeth Weir you once encountered.
uh, we don't have that kind of technology here.
but we do.
if you give us temporary Replicator bodies and a lab to work in, we can assemble them ourselves.
what, and you'll transfer your consciousness from the Replicator body to the human body?
exactly.
as human beings, we would be every bit as vulnerable as anyone else.
we would eat, sleep, get sick and die preferably of old age.
what about ascension? I'm assuming that's still on the agenda.
it is.
wait a second.
building humans, that's gonna take time, isn't it?
I mean, first you have to create the technology to do it.
we're talking nanites organically assembling each body inside out, starting at the molecular level.
well, then you have to create the machine to transfer the consciousness.
I mean, that's gonna take God knows how long!
replicators, as you know, work very fast no need for breaks or food or sleep.
it's worth thinking about.
look, he may be right,
I mean if only to regain control of the city.
while they're in our computer systems, Atlantis is in serious trouble.
if we do this,
I want severe restrictions placed on their capabilities:
no replicating, no shape-shifting...
the basic model. You got it.
I mean, no bells, no whistles. They'll be able to effect some minor repairs but that's about it.
seal off the lab, put a forcefield around it.
do whatever you need to do to feel safe, but I've already convinced the others that this is their only option.
they won't give you any trouble.
you have my word.
do it.
OK. Initialising forcefield.
are your teams in place?
round the clock watch.
good.
once these human bodies are made and they're downloaded into them, what happens then?
well, seeing as they'll be just like any other human beings, I see no reason not to let them go.
they could become valuable allies.
or what if one of them decides to stay?
let's cross one bridge at a time, all right?
how's it going?
almost done. They're just finishing up the last one.
that was fast.
actually creating Replicators is fairly simple comparatively speaking. Humans, not so much.
well, the sooner they get it done, the better.
and once the last transfer is complete, I want those Replicator bodies destroyed.
they certainly don't waste any time, do they?
no, they don't.
there's no breaks, no chit-chat, no social interaction whatsoever.
just the perfect working environment.
Ronon, you don't have to stay there the whole time, you know.
I'm good.
talk, talk, talk, that's all he does. You can't shut him up
keep me apprised.
Mckay! Power's out!
what the...?
forcefield...
what happened? - One of the Replicators escaped. Koracen, the leader.
must have written some kind of hidden programme that was timed to kill power as soon as they were downloaded into the Replicator bodies.
it disabled the forcefield and they were able to pry open the doors.
where is she?
she went after Koracen.
three teams are in pursuit. We've lost all radio contact.
go join them.
go to the Control Room, try to get the power restored.
what do we do with them?
shoot them.
keep shooting them.
they'll go down eventually.
wait!
we knew nothing of Koracen's plan.
if we were part of it, we would not be standing here right now.
please. We're complying with your wishes.
nothing gets through that door.
they move an inch, shoot them.
hold on!
you just couldn't wait for those human bodies, could you?
the human body is frail, weak;
every second that much closer to dying.
Yeah, and this whole ascension thing, you're just giving up on that, huh?
not at all. I'm certain there's another way and with this body, I'll have plenty of time to discover it.
any luck?
they've shut just about everything down.
the power's cut to most of the critical systems. Except for the D. H.D. and the Gate.
they're obviously going to try to dial out.
now, I've managed to gain remote access to the mainframe.
I'm creating a work-around to allow the resumption of naqahdah power to the central tower's primary systems.
it's minimal, to be sure, but from there at least we'll be able to...
over-ride the Replicator programme and restart the remaining systems.
exactly. Just hurry. We need power back, now.
OK, is there anything you want me to do?
Yes, well, for starters you could, um, stay out of my way.
Oh, yes, sorry. All right.
and be quiet.
John, stay back. Let me handle this.
haven't you done enough already?
I'm trying to help you.
by what?
escaping?
I didn't know that Koracen would do this.
of course she knew.
Elizabeth has been a willing participant in our goals from the very beginning.
it was her idea to come here in the first place.
you said you broke off from them ?
that they couldn't track you.
track her?
she was the one who alerted us, when the time was right, to come.
we were only following her commands.
John, listen to me. I had to bring them here.
it was our only chance;
our only way out.
I didn't know that Koracen would cause this kind of trouble.
I didn't think that anyone would get hurt.
what did you think we were gonna do:
just give you a bunch of Replicator bodies and send you on your way?
I truly believed that we were no threat to you.
you may still think that you're Elizabeth, but you're not.
if you'd like to resume your work, I've decided to allow it.
we would re-engage the forcefield of course.
beef up security.
it's too risky.
I thought that bringing the others here would be safe.
I was wrong.
I can no longer guarantee there won't be any more trouble from them, or even myself.
all right, um...
what do you wanna do?
I remember after you reactivated the nanites cells inside me,
I said this was a bad idea.
so much has gone wrong since then, but I think I know how I can finally set things right.
go ahead.
if you need anything else for your work, let us know.
Thanks, Rodney.
once again, you have to promise to stay put until you're finished constructing the human bodies.
no leaving your homeworld;
no communication with any other civilisation except Atlantis.
you have my word.
good luck with your command, Richard.
it's comforting to know Atlantis is in capable hands.
thank you.
shall we?
it's OK.
I'll go first.
it's safe.
you're sure the D. H.D. reconfiguration worked?
Yes.
they were sent to a space Gate.
I guess that answers the question as to whether it was really Elizabeth.
you can go ahead, Rodney.
I don't remember where to start. - Sure you do.
no.
start with your name like we've been doing, okay, and we'll just go from there.
my name...
my name is...
Mr. Rodney ckay.
no...
Yes.
come on, now. You're Dr. Mckay, remember?
no, I'm-- I'm not anymore.
I'm not s-s-smart anymore.
doctors are smart, so I'm mister now.
okay.
I used to be the smartest person ever...
and-- and now... now I'm not.
that's what we're trying to fix, right?
no, you can't fix me.
you know we're trying our very best
no, you can't. You can't.
it's okay, Rodney, what's the next thing you're supposed to say?
where... where did john go?
he just had to go away for a few minutes. He'll be back
Rodney, I'm your friend, I'm right here.
where are you, john?
why the hell didn't you tell me my brother was this far gone?
it's happened pretty fast, Jeannie.
no, I...I got a message from him just a couple of weeks ago.
he seemed perfectly fine. He'd never been so nice.
that would have been shortly after he became infected.
I didn't recognize the symptoms in time.
it's not your fault, doc.
frankly, Mrs. Miller, we contacted you as soon as we became aware of the seriousness of his condition.
in fact, Daedalus dropped you off at the first available gate in Pegasus because we were concerned that you wouldn't make it here in time.
we thought you deserved a chance to say goodbye.
the Shrine
Dr. Keller wanted to take a moment to prepare him for your visit.
Yeah, I, uh...I think I need a moment myself.
how did... how did this happen to him?
um, there was a little snafu on the last mission.
Colonel sheppard, when you reach the research camp, please remind Dr. Nichols that he is now...one hour and 15 minutes overdue for his scheduled check-in.
right, want me to smack him around or anything?
just the reminder, please.
no, the settlement's a half hour away from the gate.
he's got them checking in every six.
I'm sure Nichols is just tired of taking the round trip.
still, it wouldn't hurt to bust his chops a bit.
that Nichols is so arrogant.
Amelia, I think I'm going to risk heading down to breakfast before they check in.
it will probably take them some time to get to the camp, and then more time for Nichols to get back to the gate and report.
there's really no point in my...telling you this.
not really, sir.
right.
be back in 20 minutes.
unscheduled offworld activation!
activate the shield.
I'm not receiving an idc.
this is sheppard. Do not lower the shield.
or the entire tower will be flooded.
I have no intention of doing that, colonel.
what's your status?
it's cold and wet. The stargate's underwater.
the entire valley's flooded.
and it's freezing!
we need you to send a jumper through so we can stay warm and dry until the water recedes.
will do, colonel, hold on.
holding on. Sheppard out.
rescue one is standing by.
what's taking so long?
why isn't the gate disengaging?
it's the water.
the constant pressure's forcing the wormhole to stay active, which means we're going to have to wait the maximum amount of time a stargate can stay open.
38 minutes.
well, we're down to 32, and before you say I told you so, we had no choice.
I can't stop shivering.
you're letting all the hot air out of your mouth.
all right, everybody, you'll be warm soon enough.
I don't know, I think I got wetter than you did.
I don't know, I got a little damp dialing the DHD.
the research camp was farther up this valley.
I'm a little concerned for Dr. Nichols' team.
right.
anyone at the research camp, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.
I repeat, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.
I'm pretty sure they're all dead.
we can't know that, Rodney.
look, the research team was studying the effects of global warming.
they set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley.
you think an ice dam broke?
it fits.
the ancients don't put stargates on a flood plain, and I certainly don't think the tide just came in.
it explains why the water's so freezing.
Aw, okay...
okay, so now I'm hot, and I'm still shivering.
were you running a fever before we left?
I don't know, maybe. I'm always running something.
all right, I think the water's receded a little.
so we're going to be stuck here all night.
in the back of a warm, cozy jumper, all right?
all you need to do is holding on for, I don't know, 30 minutes or so...
how long has he been unresponsive?
since he fell asleep in the jumper. About nine hours.
okay, let's get him to the infirmary. I want him under a scanner.
I want to have a look at you guys, too.
we're good.
by that I mean now.
I think you've just made a case for my proposal to send a malp ahead of every single transit.
stuff happens, Woolsey, and by "stuff,"
I mean-- I know what you mean, thank you.
why didn't you return in the jumper I sent you?
well, I ordered the rescue party to continue the search for Nichols' team.
there's a chance they're still alive.
of course.
I got to get checked out, and then, uh, I'm going to check on Rodney.
well, how's our boy?
no fever, no hypothermia, nothing on the scan at all.
how about you guys?
like I said, we're good.
Yeah, yeah. But we're not the ones who became unconscious.
well, I didn't really get much sleep the night before, and I did skimp on breakfast, so...
you know, Woolsey wants to send out a malp before every transit now.
well, that's going to get old fast. - That's what I said.
Hey, can I go now? I feel a little silly lying here.
I'm keeping you under observation for a little longer.
besides, I ordered you dinner.
well, then you can observe me eat, because I'm famished.
it's official. He's better.
see you, guys.
do you want me to send them in?
okay.
Rodney's all ready for you.
what am I supposed to say?
doesn't matter.
it's me. It's Jeannie. I'm...
you're my sister.
Yes.
Meredith's my...real name.
it's your first name, that's right, but you never liked it.
no.
no, it's...a girl's name.
sometimes, yes, but you go by Rodney.
Mr. Rodney·Mckay.
you're crying because of me.
no, I'm crying because I've missed you very much.
cause you're my sister.
that's right.
I'm...sick.
I know.
I know.
I'm here now.
I...
sweetie, I just need to go outside for one second, okay?
I will be right back, I promise.
hey... - I know.
I just need a second.
I just don't want him to see.
I know how you feel.
I felt the same way. - I'll go back in, I will.
he needs me, and I want to be able to say goodbye, but it's like...
it's like he's already gone. - I know.
what? How?
there's a place. I've been there before.
he'll be himself again, and you can say goodbye.
I don't understand, then why haven't you already taken him?
because it's dangerous, but I'm willing to risk it if you are.
all set?
remind me to register a complaint with whose ever idea this was.
it was yours, actually.
Oh, ho ho...
it was a good idea to keep a record of what's happening to you - and how fast, but if you'd rather not-- - no, it's fine. It's fine.
my name, right?
right.
Hey, I remembered something. Yay!
my name is Dr. Rodney·Mckay.
I'm head of the department of science something in atlantis in the, um...
for god's sake...
in the Pegasus galaxy.
okay, not bad, keep going.
Jennifer, there's...
there's something I wanted to, um...
you know, while I remember, while I still can, something I wanted to say...
go ahead.
I wasn't expecting anyone this late.
Yeah, I'm kind of one of those people who needs all the information they can get.
this is his most recent scan.
this dark area that looks like a tumor is actually a parasitic organism.
its tendrils spread far beyond any hope of surgical extraction, and it's not responding to treatment.
even stasis barely slowed its progression.
there are still a number of drug combinations that
he was infected somehow on his last mission?
well, maybe, but not necessarily.
it was too small to show up on a scan at the time, but in the Pegasus galaxy, the condition is fairly common among the very old.
right, so why him?
it's possible we're all exposed to it and fight it off.
Rodney was already suffering from a viral infection when he went on the mission at M44 5Y9, and then all that time in freezing water
so his resistance was low.
the parasite doesn't so much as kill cells as render them dormant for reasons I still don't completely understand, but the net result is ever-diminishing brain function.
as it spreads, he'll lose motor control, regulation of organ function.
ronon's people call the disease "second childhood."
you talked to Ronon. - Yes.
okay, I know what he's told you.
that he's dying, and there's nothing you can do.
no, he's dying, and I'm doing everything I can.
I have to ask you...
why did you tell me you didn't recognize the symptoms in time?
because he was already showing the symptoms when he came back from the mission, and...
I didn't see it.
so?
just what the doctor ordered.
funny.
you want my fruit cup?
no, no, no.
I think you do.
eating from the patient's tray is kind of frowned upon.
Jennifer, we practically dated.
you bought me one drink. That's hardly dating.
right, so now I'm asking you to have dinner with me.
I mean, such as it is.
I do love the fruit cup.
not that this is exactly the dinner I had in mind, but...
is that an invitation?
only if you promise to accept.
if I wasn't so taken by the new Rodney Mckay, the parasite might've been small enough for me to operate without causing significant brain trauma.
by the time he started to forget, it was too late.
I haven't given up on trying to find a treatment.
ronon told me about this place that could give mere one more day as himself again before he dies.
Jeannie, you can't possibly believe
and that you're the one who won't let him go.
it's on a planet called Talus.
it's one of the original worlds of the ancestors.
it took us about five or six hours to get there from the gate, but I was just a kid, and my grandfather had to carry me most of the way.
we could do it in about half that time.
there's a small problem with that plan.
the wraith established a major outpost there during the replicator war.
it's still there.
Yeah, well, that's never stopped us from going anywhere we needed to go before.
well, it's not just that.
you don't believe it's real.
I'm not saying-- - I am, actually.
I was there.
Yes, but you were six years old.
Ronon, listen to what you've told us
a magical shrine, inside a cave, behind a waterfall
did I say it was magic?
no, but you did say that people afflicted with Mckay's condition suddenly revert to their former selves for...
the shrine of Talus is also known among my people, for victims of the second childhood.
it offers the gift of one last day, and a quick death.
that doesn't necessarily make it real.
I'm telling you that in a matter of seconds I saw my grandfather go from someone who couldn't speak his own name, to the man that taught me how to track and hunt.
you learned to hunt when you were six years old?
for one day, he got to hold his wife in his arms, and share a meal with the people that he loved, and then he died with honor.
you can say I was too young to remember, but I know what I saw, and we can do the same thing for Mckay.
if you think that's not worth it, you're wrong.
I've never told anyone this, outside of...
my father had a disease called Alzheimer's.
it's similar in many respects to the condition that Dr. Mckay is suffering from.
my point is, I had a similar moment with him to the one you just described.
he hadn't recognized me, literally, for months, then one day, out of the blue, he had a moment of absolute clarity.
he said "Richard, what are you doing here?"
and I said, "dad, I, uh, I'm here to see you,
and he said...
he said, "It isn't that wonderful,"
and then he was gone again.
now, couldn't you be remembering a similar-- - It's not the same.
Ronon, look-- - I owe him this!
I'll take him myself. - I'll go with him.
hold on, hold on.
we know for a fact there are two hive ships and 10, 000 wraith on the ground.
if we're even going to consider this, all right, we have to make a plan.
fine, make your plan.
I'm sorry, but he's not going anywhere without my permission, and you won't get that until we talk to Rodney.
Hey, Rodney...
you got some visitors. John's here.
so are Teyla and Ronon.
the whole team.
that's right, buddy.
I want to take you to a place, a place that's going to give you a chance to be yourself again for a little while.
as you were before you became ill.
before...
Hey, pal.
Hey, J-John.
truth is, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to you, but we're willing to try, if you are.
okay.
okay. Okay, well, that settles it, then.
no, it doesn't.
Rodney, they haven't told you everything.
he doesn't need to know.
the planet they want to take you to is a wraith outpost.
you remember who the wraith are?
it means going will be very, very dangerous, not just for you, but for your friends.
we're willing to take that risk.
a risk for which, and I'm sorry.
even if it works, which I very much doubt，
you might revert to your former self for one day.
now, forgive me if that sounds more like torture than a blessing.
we're still coming up with new ideas on how to treat this thing, but if you do this, if you leave Atlantis...
it's over.
I can't help you.
doctor...
he doesn't understand.
no, he doesn't, which means the decision on whether or not to let him go is mine, and I haven't given up on trying to cure my patient.
and you still haven't given up.
no, because I don't think the damage to the cells is permanent, which means if I can to safely remove the parasite-- how long have you been at it?
weeks?
and how many days does he have left? Two at most?
look, I know you've done everything you can.
I know you feel responsible, and you want to keep trying, but...
I'm his next of kin.
that makes the decision mine.
and we're taking him.
it's recording.
well, aren't you supposed to say, "action" or something?
Oh, sorry.
I'm kidding.
okay, here we go.
my name is Dr. Rodney·Mckay.
I am head of the science and research departments here in Atlantis, in the Pegasus galaxy, in the local cluster, in the universe as we know it.
the purpose of this log is to provide a baseline for myself, and for Dr. Keller, to monitor the progress of my, um...memory loss.
ironic, isn't it?
by reciting the aforementioned, as well as a list of things I know like the back of my hand, starting with pi, to, say, 12 decimals.
Rodney on board?
Yes.
are we clear on the rules of engagement?
we'll get in and get out before the wraith even know it.
Colonel sheppard, if in fact Dr. Mckay does regain his...
say goodbye for me.
I thought you didn't believe.
he'll be glad you're here.
all right, we're either going to get away with this, or we're not.
if we don't, the ride's going to be wild, and it's is going to be fast, so I need everyone prepared.
jumper three, standing by.
send the malp through.
the malp is clear of the gate, and they're firing on it from both sides of what appears to be a deep valley.
it's deploying smoke.
you should have complete coverage of the area in five seconds.
okay, see you tomorrow.
I hope so.
that's one hell of a valley.
do you think they detected us before we were able to cloak?
no, I think the smokescreen worked.
hopefully they think we just sent a malp through ahead of us and changed our mind when they blew it up.
all right, I'm going to do a sweep of the landing area.
shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
you were there, and-and then he
Rodney, Rodney, I'm right here.
what's wrong? - I woke up, everyone had left!
Oh... buddy, I...
I'm sorry, I thought you'd fallen asleep.
I was... I got so scared, I was sure that...by the morning what was left of my mind was going to be gone!
I'm going to take you back to your quarters, okay?
John... John, I've never been so scared.
I'm slipping away. I'm slipping away, and I don't know how to stop myself!
look, you're still here. All right?
you're still here.
Yeah.
I am.
and I'm not going anywhere.
you know, you want to hang out, you just...hang out.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do with myself.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you up.
all right, look, it's a nice night out.
let's go have some beer on the pier, okay?
I drink beer?
a lot.
take this.
come on, buddy, let's go.
I don't know, should I have another?
I shouldn't have banged on your door like that. I feel ridiculous.
don't.
I've been trying to remember the name of my sister's kid.
pretty sure that's not it.
it's Madison. See?
at least you remembered what it wasn't.
Oh, there's an underrated skill.
I'm just saying you may not be as far gone as you think.
I'm hiding it.
believe me, I've already forgotten more than most people will ever know, and I know that sounds...arrogant, is that right?
Yeah.
this morning I was trying to help Zelenka finish a device that was apparently my idea.
I was useless.
Jennifer says it's going to get worse now almost by the hour.
in a week or so, I won't even remember my name.
how's about...how about we say goodbye now?
no.
what do you mean, no? - I mean, I'm not saying goodbye.
well, I'm saying it anyway. - I'm not listening.
Yeah, but pretty soon I won't even know who you are. - Then I'll remind you.
but I don't want you to see me like that.
I want you to remember me as I am, as your genius friend, not as some shell
not happening.
please. You're stuck with me, Rodney. Just accept it.
Yeah, but-- - No!
that's final.
okay.
okay.
you're a good friend, Arthur.
all right, landing area's clear.
I'm taking us in.
where are we going?
up there, do you see?
behind the waterfall, there is a cave, and when we get there, you will spend a wonderful day with your friends.
I'm tired.
I know.
we'll be there soon.
so... what do we do?
we wait.
look at the waterfall. It's cool, huh?
no.
I'm getting very faint energy readings.
what kind of energy readings?
I'm not sure.
look at this.
radiation?
not that I've ever seen.
maybe we can ask Rodney in a minute.
just hang in there, buddy.
I want to go home now!
perhaps he should stand closer to this tablet.
I-- I don't know. I think that's the source of these energy readings.
I want to go now!
a little bit longer. - Go now!
I'm here, Mere.
Yeah, obviously.
he's back.
somebody please tell me what the hell we're all doing here?
I'm head of science... and... and...research.
it's okay.
no, it is not.
Atlantis...
Pegasus...
it's 3. 1...4...
I don't know.
how can I not know that?
do you want to stop?
I keep seeing a face every time I close my eyes.
I think it's my mother.
I don't-- I don'T...
r-recognize her...
it's so long ago.
she's saying words to me...
I don't know them.
well, you can start with, what is this place?
it's the shrine of Talus.
that means nothing to me.
it's a planet of the ancestors. We brought you here.
thank you, Mr. Information.
since when did he become Ronon the explainer, and why am I not in the infirmary, huh?
what am I, better?
I am better!
no, you're not.
I am. I can feel it. This is amazing!
mere, we brought you here so we could have a chance to say goodbye to each other, but you're only going to feel like this for about a day.
that's just how it works. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
what do you remember?
I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then. Why now all of a sudden?
look, and why one day? What's with that?
it is a gift of the shrine, and from all of us who risked great danger to bring you here, one last chance to be with those you love.
and then what?
I die?
with honor.
and dignity.
screw that, I'll just stay here.
doesn't work that way.
why not?
one, this is a wraith-controlled planet.
and we're detecting ionizing radiation.
in fact, we shouldn't be standing this close to the
you've got to be kidding me.
how could you let them do this to me?
don't blame her. She didn't even want to do this.
then whose brilliant idea was it?
mine.
we all thought it was a good thing
how could this possibly be a good thing?
look, I'd got past the humiliation, I've said my goodbyes.
Meredith, I'm sorry this happened to you, but I'm not sorry that I got this chance.
please, just... try to see this as an opportunity and not
not torture?
look, I'm sorry, I just...
I thought I was going to be okay, and then now you tell me...
did you have some kind of itinerary planned?
well, actually, we're going to have a big feast first.
last supper, huh?
well, suits your messiah complex.
true.
please don't be mad at me.
I guess if I had to choose the people I would spend my last day with, then...
what is it?
honestly, I didn't expect it to work.
I expected nothing would happen, and that would be that.
so why did it?
you don't believe in magic shrines any more than I do.
show him the readings.
that's what I said.
you said "hmm"?
I just meant that I thought it was weird, too.
so what do you think, antimatter?
or a superheavy element the ancients used to use as an energy source.
I've never seen it before.
or created to power whatever this place used to be.
who could tell what that is? Must be thousands of years
whoa, - see that spike? - Come on, this is your party. Let's have some fun.
for me, this is fun. Just... save me some ham.
whoa, there it goes again.
it's like some kind of intermittent gamma that's
come with me. - What? Why?
because I need to find out something.
where are we going? - The way back to Atlantis.
sorry...
why did you do that?
to determine whether the parasite would expand rapidly back into his brain when we took him from the radiation source, and I think it did.
the reason why his symptoms disappeared when we came here was because it contracted to protect itself.
all right, well, what does that mean for us?
that leaving this chamber will probably kill him.
we can't take him back to Atlantis.
so...
we're going to have to find a way a way for me to operate on him right here.
I thought you already tried radiation.
well, I did, but we'd never come across this kind before.
the parasite is radiosensitive to it.
that's why the shrine works.
you feel fine for one day until the radiation starts making you feel sick, and you leave.
the farther away you get, the more rapidly the parasite expands back into the brain.
and your day is over. I get it.
so, if we're here, it's small enough to operate?
well, I'm guessing here, but it's the only thing I can think of that would explain his sudden remission, but I'm not going to know for certain until I get in there.
how are you going to manage that with a field kit?
I don't.
we would have to bring equipment back from Atlantis.
well, that's a problem.
what if we radio Atlantis, ask them to send a jumper through with what I need?
no, we can't.
I need that equipment, John.
the wraith are never going to fall for the same trick twice.
even if somehow they don't pick up on our radio signal, and even if the second jumper makes it through the gauntlet, they'll know we're here. We'll never make it back to atlantis.
if we don't try, he's dead.
what do you need?
to operate? I already told you.
no, bare minimum, what do you need?
more than I have in my medical kit.
I mean, I need a scanner to find out the location of the parasite.
I need the proper tools to cut his skull open.
all right.
I've got a idea. Keep him as far away from this thing as he can stand.
we'll be back in 20 minutes.
you can't expect me to operate with those.
well, I've seen surgical drills.
they're not that much different.
F-fine, assuming we can open him up, I still have no way of knowing where the parasite has contracted to.
we can use this.
a lifesigns detector?
Yeah. Why not?
well, it's just not designed to do what I need it to do on the correct scale.
Oh, we'll have Jeannie modify it.
no. You don't understand.
the radiation is compromising his immune system as we speak, which means if I don't kill him, the infection he's bound to get by being operated on in a damp cave almost certainly will!
look, if we don't do something, he's dead.
you said it.
absolutely not!
we're talking about saving your life.
look, my brain is not some new deck off the back of your house.
I'm not the one doing the surgery.
Yes, and as my parting advice, you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things.
I can do it.
Really?
and I'm fairly sure I can modify the lifesigns detector.
Yeah, with my help...
so help.
this isn't one of those PBS brain surgeries where my skull is wide open, and we're having a conversation...
I have enough anesthetic to put you out. You're not going to feel a thing.
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.
time is of the essence, Rodney.
you need to make a decision.
please, Mere. Let us try.
look, obviously I'd get around to consenting. It's just
you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.
that's life.
all right, well, let me have a little ham.
no.
no food before surgery.
Bye, Jeannie.
sorry I'm mean sometimes.
Bye, Teyla.
Bye, Ronon·Dex.
Bye, John.
I'm going to have to cut here...
here...
and here, and drill those points to resect the area.
okay.
I don't want to penetrate the dura layers until we get to that stage, so hold him as still as you can.
go.
I took too long reconfiguring the lifesigns detector.
I haven't given her enough time to perform the surgery before his immune system is compromised.
dammit, I went too far. Hold him steady.
I'm trying.
it's the parasite... it's moving.
well, maybe it knows we're going after it.
I don't think so.
I think it instinctually wants to get away from the radiation source, and we've just shown it the way out.
Ronon, we're going to need that gun of yours in about 10 seconds.
you could have stepped on it.
she told me to shoot it.
it's clear.
you did a good job.
you too.
let's get him home.
why don't you go get some sleep? I'm going to be here all night.
it's okay. I'd like to be here when he wakes up.
well, it could be a while.
he does love to sleep, our Rodney.
you should've seen him when he was a teenager.
who can sleep with all the talking?
Hi.
Hi.
thank you.
you're welcome.
that was scary.
for me too.
are you hungry?
peckish.
I'll go order you something.
there's something I wanted to...
while I remember, while I still can, there's something I wanted to say before, uh...
go ahead.
I, uh...
I love you.
loved you for some time now.
okay, where was I...
you can go ahead, Rodney.
I don't remember where to start. - Sure you do.
no.
start with your name like we've been doing, okay, and we'll just go from there.
my name...
my name is...
Mr. Rodney ckay.
no...
Yes.
come on, now. You're Dr. Mckay, remember?
no, I'm-- I'm not anymore.
I'm not s-s-smart anymore.
doctors are smart, so I'm mister now.
okay.
I used to be the smartest person ever...
and-- and now... now I'm not.
that's what we're trying to fix, right?
no, you can't fix me.
you know we're trying our very best
no, you can't. You can't.
it's okay, Rodney, what's the next thing you're supposed to say?
where... where did john go?
he just had to go away for a few minutes. He'll be back
Rodney, I'm your friend, I'm right here.
where are you, john?
why the hell didn't you tell me my brother was this far gone?
it's happened pretty fast, Jeannie.
no, I...I got a message from him just a couple of weeks ago.
he seemed perfectly fine. He'd never been so nice.
that would have been shortly after he became infected.
I didn't recognize the symptoms in time.
it's not your fault, doc.
frankly, Mrs. Miller, we contacted you as soon as we became aware of the seriousness of his condition.
in fact, Daedalus dropped you off at the first available gate in Pegasus because we were concerned that you wouldn't make it here in time.
we thought you deserved a chance to say goodbye.
the Shrine
Dr. Keller wanted to take a moment to prepare him for your visit.
Yeah, I, uh...I think I need a moment myself.
how did... how did this happen to him?
um, there was a little snafu on the last mission.
Colonel sheppard, when you reach the research camp, please remind Dr. Nichols that he is now...one hour and 15 minutes overdue for his scheduled check-in.
right, want me to smack him around or anything?
just the reminder, please.
no, the settlement's a half hour away from the gate.
he's got them checking in every six.
I'm sure Nichols is just tired of taking the round trip.
still, it wouldn't hurt to bust his chops a bit.
that Nichols is so arrogant.
Amelia, I think I'm going to risk heading down to breakfast before they check in.
it will probably take them some time to get to the camp, and then more time for Nichols to get back to the gate and report.
there's really no point in my...telling you this.
not really, sir.
right.
be back in 20 minutes.
unscheduled offworld activation!
activate the shield.
I'm not receiving an idc.
this is sheppard. Do not lower the shield.
or the entire tower will be flooded.
I have no intention of doing that, colonel.
what's your status?
it's cold and wet. The stargate's underwater.
the entire valley's flooded.
and it's freezing!
we need you to send a jumper through so we can stay warm and dry until the water recedes.
will do, colonel, hold on.
holding on. Sheppard out.
rescue one is standing by.
what's taking so long?
why isn't the gate disengaging?
it's the water.
the constant pressure's forcing the wormhole to stay active, which means we're going to have to wait the maximum amount of time a stargate can stay open.
38 minutes.
well, we're down to 32, and before you say I told you so, we had no choice.
I can't stop shivering.
you're letting all the hot air out of your mouth.
all right, everybody, you'll be warm soon enough.
I don't know, I think I got wetter than you did.
I don't know, I got a little damp dialing the DHD.
the research camp was farther up this valley.
I'm a little concerned for Dr. Nichols' team.
right.
anyone at the research camp, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.
I repeat, this is colonel sheppard. Please respond.
I'm pretty sure they're all dead.
we can't know that, Rodney.
look, the research team was studying the effects of global warming.
they set up camp at the foot of a massive glacier up the valley.
you think an ice dam broke?
it fits.
the ancients don't put stargates on a flood plain, and I certainly don't think the tide just came in.
it explains why the water's so freezing.
Aw, okay...
okay, so now I'm hot, and I'm still shivering.
were you running a fever before we left?
I don't know, maybe. I'm always running something.
all right, I think the water's receded a little.
so we're going to be stuck here all night.
in the back of a warm, cozy jumper, all right?
all you need to do is holding on for, I don't know, 30 minutes or so...
how long has he been unresponsive?
since he fell asleep in the jumper. About nine hours.
okay, let's get him to the infirmary. I want him under a scanner.
I want to have a look at you guys, too.
we're good.
by that I mean now.
I think you've just made a case for my proposal to send a malp ahead of every single transit.
stuff happens, Woolsey, and by "stuff,"
I mean-- I know what you mean, thank you.
why didn't you return in the jumper I sent you?
well, I ordered the rescue party to continue the search for Nichols' team.
there's a chance they're still alive.
of course.
I got to get checked out, and then, uh, I'm going to check on Rodney.
well, how's our boy?
no fever, no hypothermia, nothing on the scan at all.
how about you guys?
like I said, we're good.
Yeah, yeah. But we're not the ones who became unconscious.
well, I didn't really get much sleep the night before, and I did skimp on breakfast, so...
you know, Woolsey wants to send out a malp before every transit now.
well, that's going to get old fast. - That's what I said.
Hey, can I go now? I feel a little silly lying here.
I'm keeping you under observation for a little longer.
besides, I ordered you dinner.
well, then you can observe me eat, because I'm famished.
it's official. He's better.
see you, guys.
do you want me to send them in?
okay.
Rodney's all ready for you.
what am I supposed to say?
doesn't matter.
it's me. It's Jeannie. I'm...
you're my sister.
Yes.
Meredith's my...real name.
it's your first name, that's right, but you never liked it.
no.
no, it's...a girl's name.
sometimes, yes, but you go by Rodney.
Mr. Rodney·Mckay.
you're crying because of me.
no, I'm crying because I've missed you very much.
cause you're my sister.
that's right.
I'm...sick.
I know.
I know.
I'm here now.
I...
sweetie, I just need to go outside for one second, okay?
I will be right back, I promise.
hey... - I know.
I just need a second.
I just don't want him to see.
I know how you feel.
I felt the same way. - I'll go back in, I will.
he needs me, and I want to be able to say goodbye, but it's like...
it's like he's already gone. - I know.
what? How?
there's a place. I've been there before.
he'll be himself again, and you can say goodbye.
I don't understand, then why haven't you already taken him?
because it's dangerous, but I'm willing to risk it if you are.
all set?
remind me to register a complaint with whose ever idea this was.
it was yours, actually.
Oh, ho ho...
it was a good idea to keep a record of what's happening to you - and how fast, but if you'd rather not-- - no, it's fine. It's fine.
my name, right?
right.
Hey, I remembered something. Yay!
my name is Dr. Rodney·Mckay.
I'm head of the department of science something in atlantis in the, um...
for god's sake...
in the Pegasus galaxy.
okay, not bad, keep going.
Jennifer, there's...
there's something I wanted to, um...
you know, while I remember, while I still can, something I wanted to say...
go ahead.
I wasn't expecting anyone this late.
Yeah, I'm kind of one of those people who needs all the information they can get.
this is his most recent scan.
this dark area that looks like a tumor is actually a parasitic organism.
its tendrils spread far beyond any hope of surgical extraction, and it's not responding to treatment.
even stasis barely slowed its progression.
there are still a number of drug combinations that
he was infected somehow on his last mission?
well, maybe, but not necessarily.
it was too small to show up on a scan at the time, but in the Pegasus galaxy, the condition is fairly common among the very old.
right, so why him?
it's possible we're all exposed to it and fight it off.
Rodney was already suffering from a viral infection when he went on the mission at M44 5Y9, and then all that time in freezing water
so his resistance was low.
the parasite doesn't so much as kill cells as render them dormant for reasons I still don't completely understand, but the net result is ever-diminishing brain function.
as it spreads, he'll lose motor control, regulation of organ function.
ronon's people call the disease "second childhood."
you talked to Ronon. - Yes.
okay, I know what he's told you.
that he's dying, and there's nothing you can do.
no, he's dying, and I'm doing everything I can.
I have to ask you...
why did you tell me you didn't recognize the symptoms in time?
because he was already showing the symptoms when he came back from the mission, and...
I didn't see it.
so?
just what the doctor ordered.
funny.
you want my fruit cup?
no, no, no.
I think you do.
eating from the patient's tray is kind of frowned upon.
Jennifer, we practically dated.
you bought me one drink. That's hardly dating.
right, so now I'm asking you to have dinner with me.
I mean, such as it is.
I do love the fruit cup.
not that this is exactly the dinner I had in mind, but...
is that an invitation?
only if you promise to accept.
if I wasn't so taken by the new Rodney Mckay, the parasite might've been small enough for me to operate without causing significant brain trauma.
by the time he started to forget, it was too late.
I haven't given up on trying to find a treatment.
ronon told me about this place that could give mere one more day as himself again before he dies.
Jeannie, you can't possibly believe
and that you're the one who won't let him go.
it's on a planet called Talus.
it's one of the original worlds of the ancestors.
it took us about five or six hours to get there from the gate, but I was just a kid, and my grandfather had to carry me most of the way.
we could do it in about half that time.
there's a small problem with that plan.
the wraith established a major outpost there during the replicator war.
it's still there.
Yeah, well, that's never stopped us from going anywhere we needed to go before.
well, it's not just that.
you don't believe it's real.
I'm not saying-- - I am, actually.
I was there.
Yes, but you were six years old.
Ronon, listen to what you've told us
a magical shrine, inside a cave, behind a waterfall
did I say it was magic?
no, but you did say that people afflicted with Mckay's condition suddenly revert to their former selves for...
the shrine of Talus is also known among my people, for victims of the second childhood.
it offers the gift of one last day, and a quick death.
that doesn't necessarily make it real.
I'm telling you that in a matter of seconds I saw my grandfather go from someone who couldn't speak his own name, to the man that taught me how to track and hunt.
you learned to hunt when you were six years old?
for one day, he got to hold his wife in his arms, and share a meal with the people that he loved, and then he died with honor.
you can say I was too young to remember, but I know what I saw, and we can do the same thing for Mckay.
if you think that's not worth it, you're wrong.
I've never told anyone this, outside of...
my father had a disease called Alzheimer's.
it's similar in many respects to the condition that Dr. Mckay is suffering from.
my point is, I had a similar moment with him to the one you just described.
he hadn't recognized me, literally, for months, then one day, out of the blue, he had a moment of absolute clarity.
he said "Richard, what are you doing here?"
and I said, "dad, I, uh, I'm here to see you,
and he said...
he said, "It isn't that wonderful,"
and then he was gone again.
now, couldn't you be remembering a similar-- - It's not the same.
Ronon, look-- - I owe him this!
I'll take him myself. - I'll go with him.
hold on, hold on.
we know for a fact there are two hive ships and 10, 000 wraith on the ground.
if we're even going to consider this, all right, we have to make a plan.
fine, make your plan.
I'm sorry, but he's not going anywhere without my permission, and you won't get that until we talk to Rodney.
Hey, Rodney...
you got some visitors. John's here.
so are Teyla and Ronon.
the whole team.
that's right, buddy.
I want to take you to a place, a place that's going to give you a chance to be yourself again for a little while.
as you were before you became ill.
before...
Hey, pal.
Hey, J-John.
truth is, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to you, but we're willing to try, if you are.
okay.
okay. Okay, well, that settles it, then.
no, it doesn't.
Rodney, they haven't told you everything.
he doesn't need to know.
the planet they want to take you to is a wraith outpost.
you remember who the wraith are?
it means going will be very, very dangerous, not just for you, but for your friends.
we're willing to take that risk.
a risk for which, and I'm sorry.
even if it works, which I very much doubt，
you might revert to your former self for one day.
now, forgive me if that sounds more like torture than a blessing.
we're still coming up with new ideas on how to treat this thing, but if you do this, if you leave Atlantis...
it's over.
I can't help you.
doctor...
he doesn't understand.
no, he doesn't, which means the decision on whether or not to let him go is mine, and I haven't given up on trying to cure my patient.
and you still haven't given up.
no, because I don't think the damage to the cells is permanent, which means if I can to safely remove the parasite-- how long have you been at it?
weeks?
and how many days does he have left? Two at most?
look, I know you've done everything you can.
I know you feel responsible, and you want to keep trying, but...
I'm his next of kin.
that makes the decision mine.
and we're taking him.
it's recording.
well, aren't you supposed to say, "action" or something?
Oh, sorry.
I'm kidding.
okay, here we go.
my name is Dr. Rodney·Mckay.
I am head of the science and research departments here in Atlantis, in the Pegasus galaxy, in the local cluster, in the universe as we know it.
the purpose of this log is to provide a baseline for myself, and for Dr. Keller, to monitor the progress of my, um...memory loss.
ironic, isn't it?
by reciting the aforementioned, as well as a list of things I know like the back of my hand, starting with pi, to, say, 12 decimals.
Rodney on board?
Yes.
are we clear on the rules of engagement?
we'll get in and get out before the wraith even know it.
Colonel sheppard, if in fact Dr. Mckay does regain his...
say goodbye for me.
I thought you didn't believe.
he'll be glad you're here.
all right, we're either going to get away with this, or we're not.
if we don't, the ride's going to be wild, and it's is going to be fast, so I need everyone prepared.
jumper three, standing by.
send the malp through.
the malp is clear of the gate, and they're firing on it from both sides of what appears to be a deep valley.
it's deploying smoke.
you should have complete coverage of the area in five seconds.
okay, see you tomorrow.
I hope so.
that's one hell of a valley.
do you think they detected us before we were able to cloak?
no, I think the smokescreen worked.
hopefully they think we just sent a malp through ahead of us and changed our mind when they blew it up.
all right, I'm going to do a sweep of the landing area.
shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
you were there, and-and then he
Rodney, Rodney, I'm right here.
what's wrong? - I woke up, everyone had left!
Oh... buddy, I...
I'm sorry, I thought you'd fallen asleep.
I was... I got so scared, I was sure that...by the morning what was left of my mind was going to be gone!
I'm going to take you back to your quarters, okay?
John... John, I've never been so scared.
I'm slipping away. I'm slipping away, and I don't know how to stop myself!
look, you're still here. All right?
you're still here.
Yeah.
I am.
and I'm not going anywhere.
you know, you want to hang out, you just...hang out.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do with myself.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have woken you up.
all right, look, it's a nice night out.
let's go have some beer on the pier, okay?
I drink beer?
a lot.
take this.
come on, buddy, let's go.
I don't know, should I have another?
I shouldn't have banged on your door like that. I feel ridiculous.
don't.
I've been trying to remember the name of my sister's kid.
pretty sure that's not it.
it's Madison. See?
at least you remembered what it wasn't.
Oh, there's an underrated skill.
I'm just saying you may not be as far gone as you think.
I'm hiding it.
believe me, I've already forgotten more than most people will ever know, and I know that sounds...arrogant, is that right?
Yeah.
this morning I was trying to help Zelenka finish a device that was apparently my idea.
I was useless.
Jennifer says it's going to get worse now almost by the hour.
in a week or so, I won't even remember my name.
how's about...how about we say goodbye now?
no.
what do you mean, no? - I mean, I'm not saying goodbye.
well, I'm saying it anyway. - I'm not listening.
Yeah, but pretty soon I won't even know who you are. - Then I'll remind you.
but I don't want you to see me like that.
I want you to remember me as I am, as your genius friend, not as some shell
not happening.
please. You're stuck with me, Rodney. Just accept it.
Yeah, but-- - No!
that's final.
okay.
okay.
you're a good friend, Arthur.
all right, landing area's clear.
I'm taking us in.
where are we going?
up there, do you see?
behind the waterfall, there is a cave, and when we get there, you will spend a wonderful day with your friends.
I'm tired.
I know.
we'll be there soon.
so... what do we do?
we wait.
look at the waterfall. It's cool, huh?
no.
I'm getting very faint energy readings.
what kind of energy readings?
I'm not sure.
look at this.
radiation?
not that I've ever seen.
maybe we can ask Rodney in a minute.
just hang in there, buddy.
I want to go home now!
perhaps he should stand closer to this tablet.
I-- I don't know. I think that's the source of these energy readings.
I want to go now!
a little bit longer. - Go now!
I'm here, Mere.
Yeah, obviously.
he's back.
somebody please tell me what the hell we're all doing here?
I'm head of science... and... and...research.
it's okay.
no, it is not.
Atlantis...
Pegasus...
it's 3. 1...4...
I don't know.
how can I not know that?
do you want to stop?
I keep seeing a face every time I close my eyes.
I think it's my mother.
I don't-- I don'T...
r-recognize her...
it's so long ago.
she's saying words to me...
I don't know them.
well, you can start with, what is this place?
it's the shrine of Talus.
that means nothing to me.
it's a planet of the ancestors. We brought you here.
thank you, Mr. Information.
since when did he become Ronon the explainer, and why am I not in the infirmary, huh?
what am I, better?
I am better!
no, you're not.
I am. I can feel it. This is amazing!
mere, we brought you here so we could have a chance to say goodbye to each other, but you're only going to feel like this for about a day.
that's just how it works. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
what do you remember?
I remember you not wanting me to say goodbye then. Why now all of a sudden?
look, and why one day? What's with that?
it is a gift of the shrine, and from all of us who risked great danger to bring you here, one last chance to be with those you love.
and then what?
I die?
with honor.
and dignity.
screw that, I'll just stay here.
doesn't work that way.
why not?
one, this is a wraith-controlled planet.
and we're detecting ionizing radiation.
in fact, we shouldn't be standing this close to the
you've got to be kidding me.
how could you let them do this to me?
don't blame her. She didn't even want to do this.
then whose brilliant idea was it?
mine.
we all thought it was a good thing
how could this possibly be a good thing?
look, I'd got past the humiliation, I've said my goodbyes.
Meredith, I'm sorry this happened to you, but I'm not sorry that I got this chance.
please, just... try to see this as an opportunity and not
not torture?
look, I'm sorry, I just...
I thought I was going to be okay, and then now you tell me...
did you have some kind of itinerary planned?
well, actually, we're going to have a big feast first.
last supper, huh?
well, suits your messiah complex.
true.
please don't be mad at me.
I guess if I had to choose the people I would spend my last day with, then...
what is it?
honestly, I didn't expect it to work.
I expected nothing would happen, and that would be that.
so why did it?
you don't believe in magic shrines any more than I do.
show him the readings.
that's what I said.
you said "hmm"?
I just meant that I thought it was weird, too.
so what do you think, antimatter?
or a superheavy element the ancients used to use as an energy source.
I've never seen it before.
or created to power whatever this place used to be.
who could tell what that is? Must be thousands of years
whoa, - see that spike? - Come on, this is your party. Let's have some fun.
for me, this is fun. Just... save me some ham.
whoa, there it goes again.
it's like some kind of intermittent gamma that's
come with me. - What? Why?
because I need to find out something.
where are we going? - The way back to Atlantis.
sorry...
why did you do that?
to determine whether the parasite would expand rapidly back into his brain when we took him from the radiation source, and I think it did.
the reason why his symptoms disappeared when we came here was because it contracted to protect itself.
all right, well, what does that mean for us?
that leaving this chamber will probably kill him.
we can't take him back to Atlantis.
so...
we're going to have to find a way a way for me to operate on him right here.
I thought you already tried radiation.
well, I did, but we'd never come across this kind before.
the parasite is radiosensitive to it.
that's why the shrine works.
you feel fine for one day until the radiation starts making you feel sick, and you leave.
the farther away you get, the more rapidly the parasite expands back into the brain.
and your day is over. I get it.
so, if we're here, it's small enough to operate?
well, I'm guessing here, but it's the only thing I can think of that would explain his sudden remission, but I'm not going to know for certain until I get in there.
how are you going to manage that with a field kit?
I don't.
we would have to bring equipment back from Atlantis.
well, that's a problem.
what if we radio Atlantis, ask them to send a jumper through with what I need?
no, we can't.
I need that equipment, John.
the wraith are never going to fall for the same trick twice.
even if somehow they don't pick up on our radio signal, and even if the second jumper makes it through the gauntlet, they'll know we're here. We'll never make it back to atlantis.
if we don't try, he's dead.
what do you need?
to operate? I already told you.
no, bare minimum, what do you need?
more than I have in my medical kit.
I mean, I need a scanner to find out the location of the parasite.
I need the proper tools to cut his skull open.
all right.
I've got a idea. Keep him as far away from this thing as he can stand.
we'll be back in 20 minutes.
you can't expect me to operate with those.
well, I've seen surgical drills.
they're not that much different.
F-fine, assuming we can open him up, I still have no way of knowing where the parasite has contracted to.
we can use this.
a lifesigns detector?
Yeah. Why not?
well, it's just not designed to do what I need it to do on the correct scale.
Oh, we'll have Jeannie modify it.
no. You don't understand.
the radiation is compromising his immune system as we speak, which means if I don't kill him, the infection he's bound to get by being operated on in a damp cave almost certainly will!
look, if we don't do something, he's dead.
you said it.
absolutely not!
we're talking about saving your life.
look, my brain is not some new deck off the back of your house.
I'm not the one doing the surgery.
Yes, and as my parting advice, you need to stop letting these guys talk you into doing stupid things.
I can do it.
Really?
and I'm fairly sure I can modify the lifesigns detector.
Yeah, with my help...
so help.
this isn't one of those PBS brain surgeries where my skull is wide open, and we're having a conversation...
I have enough anesthetic to put you out. You're not going to feel a thing.
Yeah, it's probably a hammer.
time is of the essence, Rodney.
you need to make a decision.
please, Mere. Let us try.
look, obviously I'd get around to consenting. It's just
you've thrown an awful lot at me all at once.
that's life.
all right, well, let me have a little ham.
no.
no food before surgery.
Bye, Jeannie.
sorry I'm mean sometimes.
Bye, Teyla.
Bye, Ronon·Dex.
Bye, John.
I'm going to have to cut here...
here...
and here, and drill those points to resect the area.
okay.
I don't want to penetrate the dura layers until we get to that stage, so hold him as still as you can.
go.
I took too long reconfiguring the lifesigns detector.
I haven't given her enough time to perform the surgery before his immune system is compromised.
dammit, I went too far. Hold him steady.
I'm trying.
it's the parasite... it's moving.
well, maybe it knows we're going after it.
I don't think so.
I think it instinctually wants to get away from the radiation source, and we've just shown it the way out.
Ronon, we're going to need that gun of yours in about 10 seconds.
you could have stepped on it.
she told me to shoot it.
it's clear.
you did a good job.
you too.
let's get him home.
why don't you go get some sleep? I'm going to be here all night.
it's okay. I'd like to be here when he wakes up.
well, it could be a while.
he does love to sleep, our Rodney.
you should've seen him when he was a teenager.
who can sleep with all the talking?
Hi.
Hi.
thank you.
you're welcome.
that was scary.
for me too.
are you hungry?
peckish.
I'll go order you something.
there's something I wanted to...
while I remember, while I still can, there's something I wanted to say before, uh...
go ahead.
I, uh...
I love you.
loved you for some time now.
okay, where was I...
you have some wraith DNA.
my father told people that it was a gift.
Ah, they've picked up my signal.
a subspace tracking device.
I had it implanted.
the hives are firing on each other.
are you sure? - Definitely.
they're not pulling any punches either.
so all it took was the destruction of my ship for you to finally trust me.
Oh, not true, I still don't trust you.
I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect balance ability well beyond any normal human, but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the wraith...
the need to feed.
I still say we should've brought backup.
another jumper, or a marine unit, something.
this is intended to be a diplomatic mission, Rodney.
what kind of message would that send?
well, a strong one, hopefully.
everybody's going to be fine if they don't panic.
easier said than done.
there they are.
my god, how big is that thing?
never seen a hive in space, huh?
I've never seen one period.
I mean, I've seen video logs, but never in person.
well, you never forget your first.
they know we're here.
apparently. We're receiving a transmission.
docking instructions.
what, no, "hello." Greetings, weary travelers?
guess not. So much for the red carpet.
so, what happens now?
well, if history has taught us anything, this is the part where we get double-crossed and taken prisoner.
that will not happen this time, Rodney.
we were invited, remember?
and that makes a difference?
this looks a little familiar.
lower your weapons.
my apologies.
you understand.
you can't be too careful.
welcome to my ship.
the Queen
this is my second-in-command.
I've asked him to be a part of these discussions.
please, sit.
fruit bowl, nice touch.
well, we picked them up on our travels.
I thought it would make our discussions more comfortable.
I hope they prove as delicious as the farmers who grew them.
all right, let's just get this over with.
so, I understand you have a proposal, a breakthrough of some kind?
this is Dr. Keller. She's our chief medical officer, and she's going to explain everything to you.
well, um...
uh, as you may already know, we recently stumbled across a lab belonging to Michael, - the wraith that we-- - I know who he is.
of course you do.
word of your success against him spread rapidly among my kind.
we are very grateful.
trust me, we didn't do it for you.
anyway, we recovered a database from his lab that allowed us to continue his research into
for what purpose?
we've come up with a gene therapy that alters wraith DNA in a small but significant way.
in a nutshell-- we think we can make it so that you, and any other wraith we treat, will never need to feed on humans again.
this is absurd.
well, actually, it's not as big of a change as you might think.
your bodies already contain all the organs necessary to digest food.
here.
try this.
if I consume this, it may give me a moment's pleasure, but it will not sustain me.
but that can change, at least in theory.
why would we want this?
of what benefit is it?
well, think about it.
if you put yourself on regular food, you could give up all those tiresome cullings.
it would give you a significant advantage over other hives.
not to mention I could stop waiting for the chance to kill you, in theory.
our current feeding process gives us strength, our ability to heal, our longevity.
well, um, we're not entirely sure how this change would affect your, um... gifts.
they may continue, although possibly in a diminished form.
possibly?
we can't be sure until we administer it to, um, live subjects.
well, let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoffan drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more.
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?
which means that every time you feed, you're taking a risk.
bottom line is, there's not enough food to go around.
that's why you wraith are at each other's throats. So... here's your chance.
this is wrong.
we shouldn't be here.
I don't know, from where I was sitting, things seemed to go pretty well.
Yeah.
you don't seem too happy about it.
I was just expecting a little more resistance.
well, he hasn't said yes yet.
Yeah, but something makes me think he wants to.
and why not? It is a reasonable offer.
why are we thinking of ways to fix them when we should be thinking of ways to kill them?
we've been trying to do that for four years. They're still here.
the wraith may not deserve our consideration, but as john pointed out, we're not doing this for them.
there's something going on here, something he's not telling us.
what a surprise.
I'm sorry.
am I disturbing you?
come in.
I have... considered your offer.
that was fast.
I believe your idea has merit, if you can make the treatment to work.
it'll work.
of course, converting a single hive would be pointless.
it would make little difference to the humans of this galaxy and would make us pariahs amongst are own kind.
wait a minute, I thought you worked with a whole group of hives.
I do, but I may have... exaggerated my position within the alliance.
he doesn't have the clout.
then he's no good to us.
there's only one you need to convince.
we call her the primary.
the uber-queen?
convince her, and the rest will fall into line.
then convince her.
she will only speak with another queen.
and your queen was killed last year in the skies above Atlantis.
regrettably, yes, but the primary does not know this.
you... you bluffed your way into the alliance and convinced them you still have a queen?
they would not have accepted me otherwise.
up to now, I've been able to maintain this subterfuge, but a face-to-face meeting, that would be difficult.
in fact, there is only one person who could help me.
this is crazy.
believe me, this is not a decision I am taking lightly.
do you realize what he's asking you to do?
well, Dr. Keller assures me that the procedure is completely reversible and will have no lasting ill-effects.
I'm not talking about the procedure.
I know.
look, even if this works, even if all the wraith stop feeding, you think they're going to become nice and friendly overnight?
no.
they're going to have a massive technological advantage.
you're suggesting they will enslave the people of this galaxy rather than feed on them.
we've seen the same thing happen in our galaxy.
you didn't voice this objection before.
nobody was asking you to risk your life.
my wraith DNA makes me the only possible candidate.
anyone else would be detected by the queen immediately.
well, that's fine, by my question is, why now?
the wraith are busy killing each other. Why don't we just sit back and watch?
eventually, one faction will emerge victorious, and then everything will go back to the way it was.
but maybe not for a while, so we can afford to wait.
and if Todd's alliance is destroyed?
we may never have another opportunity like this again.
I admit, this may not solve the wraith problem once and for all, but there are people alive today who will be culled in the coming weeks and months, and if I can save even some of them, I have to try.
if not for myself, then for my son.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
this is Sheppard, go ahead.
Mr. Woolsey wanted me to inform you, sir, he's here.
you sure you're ready for this?
as ready as I'll ever be.
I'm sorry. I...
I feel like you're being pressured into this because of my research.
I am not being pressured into anything, and your research may save thousands, even millions of lives.
remember that.
right.
can I help you?
just remember, if anything happens to her, there won't be anywhere in the galaxy you can hide.
is that all?
right.
how is my patient?
she's fine.
very well, let's get started.
don't worry, he's just here as a technical advisor.
I'm going to be performing the surgery.
all right, we're ready.
when are we going to get to see her?
give it some time, just relax.
all right, you can see her now.
how do I look?
now, assume your throne.
are you trying to get us both killed?
I do not understand.
at the first sign of deception, the primary will not hesitate to slit our throats!
you said she would sense my wraith DNA.
it is not your DNA that concerns me.
it is your manner, your bearing.
you project apprehension.
well, given the circumstances, it may be understandable, but it is not acceptable!
above all, you must never show weakness.
now... again!
how long is this going to take, anyway?
until Todd's satisfied she can pass as a wraith queen.
you know, personally, I'm not inclined to rush this thing.
she's already too convincing if you ask me.
creeps me out.
she's still Teyla, underneath all that.
maybe that's the problem.
look, I'm not any crazier about this than you guys, but the fact is, Todd's putting his life on the line, too.
I don't think he'd go in there with her if he didn't think she could pull this off.
Where's Teyla?
resting.
you'll be pleased to know we've received word back from the primary's hive.
we've been instructed to meet them at their current location.
so, what's the plan?
once we arrive, we make contact with the ship and make our way over.
then Teyla will put forward my proposal.
Oh, your proposal?
believe me, the less the primary knows about my dealings with the humans of Atlantis, the better.
if she doesn't know it's coming from us, what are the chances she's going to buy it?
our alliance has recently been dealt a number of setbacks.
you're getting your asses kicked.
indeed.
although the primary would never admit it out loud, but the one thing stronger than her pride is her instinct for survival.
don't be nervous.
I am not.
so... at long last we meet.
indeed.
many among my crew were beginning to think you didn't exist.
you must point them out to me, so that I may remove all doubt from their minds.
that will no longer be necessary.
make your way to my ship, and do not keep me waiting again.
she likes you.
you think so?
it was as warm a reception as we could expect.
how'd it go?
apparently, quite well.
they're preparing a shuttle to take me over to the other hive.
you know we can pull the plug anytime you want, you just give us the word.
no.
we've come this far. I intend to go through with this.
well, we'll be right here.
if anything goes wrong, we'll get you out.
but nothing's going to.
well, no, of course not, but I'm just saying, if it does-- - Rodney... which it won't.
hey... just be careful over there.
welcome to my ship.
where is your queen?
you will meet her in time.
inform the bridge they're onboard.
take us to hyperspace.
this was not part of the agreement.
you did not expect us to conduct this meeting here, within weapons range of your hive?
we are part of the same alliance.
unless you do not trust us?
I make it a practice to trust no one I do not know.
it is how the queen wishes it.
follow me.
please.
what's going on?
the primary's hive just went into hyperspace.
what?
that wasn't part of the deal.
no, it was not.
Where'd they go?
I do not know.
there is no way to track them. - He's lying.
I assure you, I know nothing of this.
it appears we have no choice but to trust each other.
the queen shall see you shortly.
what have you done?
I swear I did not expect this to happen.
we're in no danger.
if the queen did not believe us, we'd be dead already.
and if she begins to suspect?
we are trapped on this ship.
everything will be fine, provided you continue to play your part.
we must proceed as planned.
what is he doing here?
I thought his presence would be useful, as he is the one you've been dealing with up until now.
I do not like surprises.
nor do I, and yet you are the one who took your ship to hyperspace the moment we stepped aboard.
very well.
come.
let's sit.
what are you doing?
what is the meaning of this?
forgive me, but this is the way it must be.
you must say that you killed her.
are you insane?
this is how it is done with our kind.
this is how power changes hands.
but I do not want-- - listen to me!
the crew will not be happy, but nor will they wish to be without a queen.
you caught her off-guard.
many will perceive that to mean that she was growing weak.
all you need to do is convince them that you are a capable replacement, and they will accept you.
and if I can't?
then we're both dead.
what is this?
I have taken what is rightfully mine.
you killed her!
Yes, and you are the better for it.
you will die for this.
how dare you point a weapon at your queen!
this was my queen!
not anymore.
she no longer had full control over the alliance.
if you can't see that, you're a fool.
did I ask you to speak for me?
no, my queen.
wag your tongue like that again, and I will remove it.
is that understood?
Yes, my queen!
now, drop us out of hyperspace and run a full diagnostic.
I wish to know the state of my new flagship.
and have this... thing removed from my sight.
Yes, my queen.
I have surveyed the crew.
you'll be pleased to know they were entirely fooled.
what were you thinking?
you put both our lives at terrible risk.
I know.
if you'll allow me to explain-- - how could you do this?
it was necessary. The former queen was never going to accept your proposal.
and so you killed her and forced me to take the blame?
if I had taken the blame, I would have been killed, and you would have been held captive.
that was not the desired outcome.
you must understand, our culture is different from your own.
we govern ourselves by different rules.
it was important for you to claim ownership of the act of killing the queen.
you should have informed me of your intention to make me queen of this hive.
perhaps, but I doubt you would have gone through with it had you known.
you're right. It was a foolish, reckless plan.
most wraith seek to be ruled.
they fear being without a queen.
I knew that if you presented yourself as a viable substitute, most of them would just fall in line.
most of them?
the point is, we have achieved what we set out to do.
you are now effectively in control of the alliance.
we may now implement Dr. Keller's plan without hindrance.
then there is no further need for us to continue this charade.
take me back to your ship.
soon, but first, you must allow some time for order to be restored, for things to return to normal.
once they do, you may take your leave, and no one on this crew will be the wiser.
I still say this was a setup.
I don't know, Kenny seemed pretty surprised when that ship disappeared.
who?
Kenny, the second-in-command.
well, since when did we start calling him that?
maybe he wasn't in on it.
I don't know, if Todd wanted to kidnap Teyla, he would've done it the second we arrived.
it doesn't add up.
seriously, the next time we have to name one of these guys, we should take a vote.
so, what are we going to do?
we can't stay here. We're stuck on a hive surrounded by wraith.
not exactly our strongest position.
all I've got is a jumper. Where do you want to go?
well, we get to a gate, we gate back to Atlantis, and then we figure out where they took Teyla.
how, exactly?
okay, so I haven't quite worked out the details yet, but... we have something.
the primary's hive has dropped out of hyperspace.
how do you know?
we're receiving a signal.
it's Todd's subspace transmitter.
they're in empty space, on the edge of a large nebula.
what are they doing out there?
who cares? This is our chance. Let's go after them.
I've already plotted the course, but you should know that it will arouse suspicion for us to arrive unannounced.
well, let's worry about that later.
for now, this is the closest thing they've got to a distress signal.
I'm sorry to disturb you, my queen.
we've received an urgent report.
you intend to make her read it?
a hive belonging to another alliance has been detected above one of our feeding grounds not far from here.
have you tried to contact them?
they are not responding.
dispatch the closest hive to investigate.
we are the closest hive.
it falls upon us to intercept.
we must remain here.
my queen, perhaps we should discuss this in private.
leave us.
we must respond to this.
to do otherwise will read as weakness.
the crew will not understand.
then let them be confused.
spoken like a true queen, but you risk breeding suspicion.
for the moment, they believe you, and are prepared to serve you but if you break that trust by making irrational decisions, they will quickly fall away from you.
what about your ship?
it is probably already on its way.
they will pick up on our new location as soon as they arrive.
inform the bridge to set a course.
now, Kenny's right about one thing
the second we drop out of hyperspace, the primary's hive ship's going to know something's up.
we drop out early, go the rest of the way by jumper.
that's going to take too long. We need a diversion.
so, what... what kind of a diversion?
you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah, but I don't think we can rely on Kenny to give the order, though.
we don't give him a choice.
what are you talking about? What order?
Oh, no, wait a minute. You're not thinking about attacking the other ship?
look, it's the only way to keep them occupied long enough to get on board, get Teyla, and get back.
but it's also incredibly risky. I mean, either of the ships could be destroyed.
well, we'll just make sure we get her out of there before that happens.
look, I realize the odds aren't exactly in our favor, Rodney, but the longer we wait to get Teyla, the more likely it is we never will.
we just have to keep all of our options open.
we have reached the feeding ground.
they will attempt to negotiate a concession, but you must stand firm.
they may even threaten to attack, but they will not want to fight any more than we do.
the other hive is trying to contact us.
ignore them. Charge weapons.
you wish to attack unprovoked?
we were provoked.
they have encroached upon our territory.
I want them destroyed.
now!
what are you doing?
what does it look like?
I told you to talk to them.
you also told me to show no weakness.
they're returning fire.
we're taking hull damage.
deploy the darts.
under these conditions, they will suffer heavy losses.
I'm fully aware of the costs, but we must take a firm stance against intrusions such as this.
to kill wraith.
half the first wave has been destroyed.
but the survivors are now too close to be affected by the ship's weapons, and they can attack at will.
until the enemy launches their own darts to intercept.
that will take time.
with any luck, we've caught them off guard.
they're not here.
where the hell are they?
they've moved, to one of our more populated feeding grounds.
what for?
I do not know.
I'm not on the ship.
but if I had to guess, I would say they've gone to cull.
what now?
what else can we do? We go after them.
if they jump into hyperspace, we're going to lose them again, right?
pretty much. Todd's locator beacon doesn't work in hyperspace.
we got to stop playing catch-up.
is there a stargate on that planet?
of course.
then drop us off. We can get there faster in the jumper.
how do you intend to get on board their ship?
don't worry about it. Just get us to the nearest stargate.
my queen, our darts are outnumbered two to one.
if we do not recall them now, they will be wiped out.
and their sacrifice will be remembered when this alliance rules the galaxy.
what was that?
keep firing all other batteries.
all right, we should be coming up on them now.
wait a minute, there's two of them.
they're not pulling any punches, either.
still picking up that signal?
Yeah.
all right, it's that one.
they're not doing so good.
what do you mean?
they must've lost some of their weapons.
I mean, they're seriously outgunned.
we got to do something.
you know, just last week I was talking to Zelenka about trying to reverse-engineer a Daedalus beaming system for the jumpers.
And?
Oh, well, no, we're nowhere near close.
I mean, the Asgard technology's incredibly complicated
what the hell are you bringing this up for now?
I'm just saying that this would be the perfect situation for something like...
all right, everybody hold on. We're going in.
what are you doing?
trying to tip the scales a little.
are you nuts? They can see us!
think that did it?
we're about to find out.
that's impossible.
the enemy hive just exploded.
well done, my queen.
perhaps next time, you will not be so quick to question my tactics.
recall the darts.
darts are heading back. Bay doors are open.
all right, that's our cue. I'm going in.
where do we go?
I don't know.
what do you mean, you don't know? - It's hard to tell.
I think we're on the wrong level.
Plus, the signal keeps moving around.
that's a good sign Todd's alive.
still doesn't tell us anything about Teyla.
all right.
this way. I think.
we're going to have to circle back.
Oh, great, I got to figure this out all over again?
another patrol coming this way. - So, what are we going to do?
we got no choice.
let's move. - Which way?
I guess that answers that.
inform the queen.
we have intruders.
now what?
well, if i had to guess, I'd say we'll be taken in front of the queen, who will demand answers and threaten to feed on us.
at which time, I hope to have plan to get us out of here.
very reassuring.
it's Teyla. She's alive.
Rodney, quiet.
leave us.
John, Ronon, Rodney, it is good to see you, but you should not have come for me.
Why? What's going on?
I'll explain later, but you must not attempt to escape.
you're in no danger.
I'm now queen of this hive.
wait, what?
it is a long story.
no, we got a jumper here, we can leave right now.
no, I must solidify my position first.
it is the only chance we have to ensure the alliance will accept the treatment.
otherwise, this will all have been for nothing.
all right.
we'll let it play out. For now.
my queen... what are you doing here?
who authorized you to wait in my quarters?
I let myself in.
I needed to see you in private.
I do not wish to speak right now. Come back later.
I am your queen. I command you-- - you are not my queen.
how dare you speak to me like this.
remove yourself from my sight immediately.
I saw you talking with the prisoners from Atlantis.
And?
I may not interrogate prisoners on my own ship?
Oh, you may, though it is odd that you refer to them as prisoners.
I overheard what you said to them.
you knew them, and they knew you, and I asked myself "how is such a thing possible?
I suspected you right from the moment you set foot upon my ship, and against my better judgment
I allowed you to remain onboard while you committed treachery after treachery.
it was my duty to defend the ship, and I failed.
I'm afraid your reign is over, my queen.
he'll not be bothering you any further.
thank you.
my hive arrived moments ago.
I've arranged for Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, and Dr. Mckay to be transferred there immediately.
good. When do I join them?
as soon as this is all over.
I am leaving behind my trusted commander.
let me be clear, you will still fall under my protection, but in my absence, you will heed his every order as if it were my own.
when he speaks, it is as though I am speaking through him.
is that understood?
Yes, my queen.
good.
then it is time.
escort me to my transport.
the queen departs.
well done.
I believe you've managed to allay all suspicions.
just remember why we did this, to disseminate Dr. Keller's treatment to as many wraith as possible.
of course.
although I think it might be wise to let matters settle for a time first.
how much time?
not long.
you're not planning on going back on our agreement, are you?
no, no.
I'm just saying that to press such a radical agenda so soon after the change in leadership... well, it may invite unwelcome questions.
fine.
very well, but bear in mind that as far as this crew is concerned, I am still their queen.
Oh, yes.
I will be watching you, and should you step out of line, I will not hesitate to make a reappearance and have you removed.
very well.
permanently.
what have you done to her, doc?
very funny.
how you feeling?
better.
still some soreness, but for the most part, it's gone.
good.
well, I have rounds, but I'll come and check on you later.
make sure he doesn't give you a hard time.
sure you're feeling okay?
Yes. Thank you.
no lingering desires to feed on anything?
only on solid food.
the blended concoctions given to me by Dr. Keller are not very satisfying.
well, it's only been two weeks. Give it some time.
look, um...
I haven't had the chance to tell you that what you did, uh, took... you know, a lot of guts.
I'm just glad it worked out for the best.
has there been any further word from Todd?
not really. We're supposed to meet with him in a few weeks about this whole gene therapy thing.
word has it he's solidified his position as, uh, "leader" of the alliance.
what?
do you not find it strange that as a result of all of this, Todd now personally has control of that entire alliance?
you think that was his plan all along, huh?
the thought had crossed my mind.
Yeah.
regardless, I think we're better off than we were before.
Yes.
I suppose you're right.
get some rest.
I'll come back and check on you.
=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
so I understand you have a proposal.
we've come up with a gene therapy that alters wraith DNA.
we think we can make it so that you will never need to feed on humans again.
here.
try this.
his name was Janus.
causality is not to be treated so lightly.
no one's treating it lightly.
you are.
you are insistent on continuing the experiment.
we order you to cease these activities.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
if we do this every time someone comes for a visit, we'd never get any work done.
we're just meeting him at the gate.
we're not just meeting him at the gate.
I've been pulled from my regular duties to help him with his database "research."
I've got stuff on the go, you know, important, vital projects for the betterment of the human race.
apparently there are other people doing equally important work, Rodney, as hard as that is to believe.
an exciting day.
Absolutely.
he's ready to beam.
very well.
Dr. Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.
thank you, Mr. Woolsey. It's great to be back.
Colonel Sheppard, Rodney...
I'll have Rodney here show you to your quarters.
actually, I'd like to get started right away, if that's okay with you, Rodney?
Oh, sure, sure.
what have you got planned?
an exciting exploration of insignificant ancient historical events?
no, not quite. I'm sure you're both familiar with the ancient named Janus?
the inventor? - Yes, he was the lead scientist and apparently a bit of a renegade.
Yeah, and I've been over all his logs.
look, this is work we've done already.
I'm pretty sure I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.
secret lab?
Yes, a place where he conducted and subsequently hid a significant portion of his unauthorized research.
and if I'm correct, it's right here... on Atlantis.
I've been over Janus' database entries with a fine-tooth comb.
I never saw any mention of a secret lab.
Janus was doing a lot of work that wasn't exactly approved by the ancient council, so it's not hard to imagine he wouldn't include a full accounting in this very public database.
do you include all of your research in your official reports?
just get to the point.
he never talked about it in his entries, but several of Janus' peers suspected he had a bastion of unfettered thought and experimentation, or as one of his lovers put it-- - he had lovers?
an isle of solitude within the city walls.
could just mean he was hard to talk to. People say things like that about me all the time.
none of these writers had any idea where the lab could be, but one of his young assistants recalls a day where Janus turned a corner down a hallway.
today I saw Janus in the hallway... there's a real page-turner.
he chased after him with a question, but when he rounded the corner, Janus was gone.
the hallway was a dead end. He had seemingly disappeared, I think, into his secret lab.
well, did this assistant happen to mention... which hallway? Yes. He does.
Yeah.
as soon as the Daedalus unloads its supplies, we'll be heading off to meet up with Todd and one of his hives.
you really think he's going to show up, huh?
and let you guys try out Dr. Keller's gene therapy on a few of his guys?
well, we held up our end of the deal.
we let him use Teyla to take control of an alliance of wraith hives.
that's what I'm saying, he's got what he wants.
I should go with you, because I have a relationship with Todd.
that is precisely why I don't want you there.
this mission is basically going to be a negotiation, and Todd has, well... less baggage with me than he does with you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't take the lead... you're second in command here, Colonel.
I know my predecessors played fast and loose with many of the rules set forth by the I. O.A.
but protocol plainly states that in the rare instance where I am required to leave Atlantis, you stay put.
you're in command here until I get back.
understood?
okay.
try not to blow her up while I'm gone.
no promises.
Yeah, I think this should be the last of it.
Hey.
Hi.
I was just leaving.
Yeah, I know.
here, let me get that.
Thanks.
so you're going on this Daedalus thing?
Yeah, uh... thank you.
I kind of have to. I'm the one that'll be administering the treatment... if, you know, we ever get to that point.
right.
I think I should come with you on this.
Really? Why?
I don't really trust these guys.
you don't trust Todd and his wraith or the entire crew of the Daedalus to protect me if something goes wrong?
I don't know.
both, I guess.
what?
nothing.
what? - Nothing, nothing.
it'd be great to have the company.
Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.
good luck.
what do you mean, "us"?
is that a water line up there?
Yeah, this section of the city flooded the first year we were here.
anything salvageable got moved to the main tower.
it's remote. That's promising.
he wouldn't want anyone around when he came in and out of his lab, like the bat cave.
yes... just like the bat cave.
I'm not picking up anything unusual... something used to be attached here.
hmm. And here... and another one.
any idea what they are?
looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.
right. Well, where are the sconces?
I don't know. Maybe the decorator changed his mind.
you said after the flood, anything worth salvaging was moved to the main tower.
now, please tell me you kept detailed records of what was found and where.
did we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?
there.
that's the hallway. Can you zoom in there?
there.
there are your light fixtures.
must have been knocked loose during the flood. - Possibly.
but you salvaged them, right? - They're lights that fell during a flood
just humor me, okay?
I think we're onto something.
all right.
here they are.
I've got them.
that's odd.
each of these three lights made a different tone when I plugged them in.
does that usually happen around here?
not usually, no.
they've been banged around a lot, underwater a few days.
maybe they're just broken.
no, it's a puzzle.
I think we need to activate these in a specific order.
a 3-digit code? You know how easy that would be to break?
there's only 6 variations.
maybe activate them a number of times in a specific order.
I don't suppose you recognize any of these three notes?
like, does it remind me of Janus' favorite Brian Eno track?
no. No such luck.
Janus' assistant said he disappeared pretty quickly down the hallway, so it can't be a long code.
maybe it's as simple as 3 tones in a row.
go for it.
hold on for a second.
what is it?
come here and push against this wall.
Why?
please. Just humor me. I think I'm on to something.
okay, on the count of three, push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?
okay.
son of a bitch.
controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.
what?
apparently tesla was close to something like this before Edison trashed his lab.
what are you talking about?
that wall was specially designed to destablize when bombarded with a very specific harmonic resonance.
that's what the tones were.
and the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust.
it's a great way to hide a door, because if you're looking for a door to open, it's never going to be found.
it's like a hologram, only better, because it's solid mass until the tones are playing.
so you could have just told me to walk through the door.
I could have, yes. - Yes, yes.
where the hell are we?
Janus' secret lab.
alert the others.
the device has been activated.
Hey, Mr. Woolsey.
Dr. Keller.
where is your burly protector?
it's odd to see you without him nowadays.
he's in the lab.
what are you working on?
a speech.
what for?
well, this is a fairly momentous occasion.
the wraith will take a step forward, not only for their own benefit, but for that of the entire galaxy.
it's a historic day.
I just think it deserves some recognition.
what have you got so far?
today is an historic day.
it's a good place to start.
well, it's a work in progress.
whoa.
that's pretty cool.
harmonic resonance.
Yeah, I was told. But what happens if the sound goes off and you're in the middle of the wall?
the wall would break apart your body.
maybe we should-- - I've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside.
the wall is now permanently open. Don't worry.
good.
so, what have we got?
the good news is it's definitely Janus' secret lab.
the bad news is getting in was the easy part.
there are levels of encryption on all data here that even the most paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use.
I mean, it is deep.
some of them are straight-up math ciphers, while others are ancient knowledge puzzles.
and until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.
sounds like you guys make a good team, though.
Yeah.
well, I guess I'll go back to being the boss.
how's that going?
pretty boring, actually.
you're more than welcome to help us crack this first stream cipher.
you know, he could have been in Mensa.
why don't you contact me when you two geniuses have a breakthrough.
will do.
sir, we're being hailed.
open a channel.
this is colonel Caldwell of the earth ship Daedalus.
we're ready to receive your delegation.
the delegation is on their way.
marks, you have the bridge.
I'm going to meet our guests.
thank you for coming.
thank you for having us.
today is an historic day.
robert Grosseteste once said
I would like to get started as soon as possible.
Yes, of course.
but I wanted to recognize I have my doubts that your plan will be effective.
so shall we drop these unfounded pleasantries and get to work?
very well.
Dr. Keller, lead the way.
please, come with me.
robert who?
never mind.
you know, it's almost dawn.
if you want to call it a night...
what? No, no, no, I'm fine, fine.
but if you need to rest, I'll completely understand.
seriously, is everything a competition with you?
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I just found you a secret lab full of really cool ancient stuff.
I kind of think that should score me some points.
okay, I will admit that I may have been a little brusque with you.
just a little.
the truth is, I really didn't think you would find anything.
well, that much I actually understand.
you do?
Yeah.
I've spent the majority of my professional life being ridiculed for my theories, most of which turned out to be correct, by the way.
I'm kind of used to it, Rodney.
doesn't that bother you?
I mean, no vindication, no recognition, no credit...
I could say the same thing about you.
the discoveries you've made, you probably could've won the nobel prizefive times over by now.
too true.
so, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?
no, we did it for the money.
good one.
wait a minute-you don't get paid more than I do, do you?
do you?
hyperspace window just opened.
Daedalus isn't due back yet.
hyperspace window detected unknown IFF
get Sheppard.
Colonel Sheppard, sir? - Yeah, uh, just resting my eyes.
who said that?
I patched into the pa in your room, sir.
you're going to want to get up here.
what's going on?
we're tracking a small ship, in atmosphere. It's coming right for us.
get the jumpers in the air.
it's closing fast, sir. It'll be here in less than 10 seconds.
shields up. I still want the jumpers ready.
here it comes... that's impossible. - What did it just do?
it passed through the shield. - Yeah, but how did it do that?
I'm not sure, sir.
ancient ships can do it.
all right, tell Teyla and a team of marines to meet me at that pier.
they should be right in front of you.
don't move!
what's at the bottom of this tower?
Rodney, this is Sheppard. Come in.
Rodney! - What's up?
get out of there right now.
Why?
control room, what's the status of that ship?
I'm sorry, Colonel. They're gone.
is it alive? - You tell me.
I'm not getting any coherent readings.
perhaps we should put it under a medical scanner.
okay, do it. - Go get a gurney.
so is it true they took Rodney and Dr. Jackson?
Yeah.
what the hell happened?
we were attacked.
that much I got, thanks. By who?
I was kind of hoping you could tell me.
okay, there is no way this is a coincidence.
we discover Janus'super-secret lab, and less than24 hours later, a bunch of aliens show up, all guns blazing?
don't think that's a little odd?
now that you mention it... they knew exactly what they were looking for.
didn't waste any time, went straight for the lab.
when they came out, one of them was carrying a device.
unfortunately, we haven't had nearly enough time to go through everything we found in here, so there's no way of knowing exactly what they took.
all this stuff came on when Rodney and Dr. Jacksoncame in here.
pretty much. It activated probably in response to rodney's A.T.A. Gene. Why?
what if something in here has been broadcasting?
a subspace signal-it's the only possible answer.
what are you talking about? - We've come across them before.
they're a real-time, practically instantaneous link between two ancient devices.
they can be separated by, like, half a galaxy.
there's a bunch of aliens out there.
they stumble upon an ancient lab, probably built by Janus himself.
it's dormant. It's not working.
then one day, out of the blue, it activates.
so they're standing around, scratching their heads. They have no ideawhat's going on.
then they discover the subspace link.
they decide to follow it, they trace it back to us.
and then attack us and take two of our people hostage?
Rodney and Dr. Jackson were not the targets.
they were at the wrong place at the wrong time.
whatever that device was, that's what they were after.
all right, good theory. So what do we do?
well, we... we've got to get out of here.
we're probably on a ship traveling through hyperspace. Where are wegoing to go?
I'll think of something. - Really?
Yep. Always do.
Oh yeah, I tried that. They zap you when you touch them.
you could told me that before I touched it. - I could have, yes.
look, they stripped us of everything but the clothing on our backs and surrounded us with laser walls...
I'm not sure how much play we have here.
we've got one thing going for us, at least. - What's that?
we're not dead yet.
good point.
it's no good.
I'm still not getting any useful readings.
the suit is emitting some sort of E. M. Field that's disrupting the scanner.
I have no idea how to shut it off.
there's no way to penetrate the shield and see what's under there?
I'm afraid not.
do you think there's a human underneath all that armor?
impossible to say. Could be a robot.
one thing's for sure- it's not like anything we've ever seen before.
Dr. Weir did say that there were other technologically advanced societies that we have yet to encounter.
we've just made first contact.
what do you want me to do?
cut it open.
Ah, it's no good. I just dulled the blade.
the neck. - What?
looks like the softest part. Try the neck.
it's already dead, Radek. - We think.
just do it.
it's working!
get out. Everyone, get out!
everyone okay? - Yes.
somebody really wants to keep secret whatever's inside that suit.
we've run close to a hundred simulations based on full medical scans of the wraith we've had in captivity.
they've all been successful.
we both know very well that computer simulations and live trials are very different.
I don't think we're doing this cavalierly. I stand by the data. It will work.
perhaps it will.
the question is, do you want it to?
I do see the benefits.
even if we only used the therapy on some of my troops... say, those whose lives, thanks to this war, are expected to be short.
why waste perfectly good resources on them, yes?
but it will be very difficult for me to ask those around me to give themselves over for the good of the human race.
but it's for your benefit too.
if you don't have to rely on human feeding, the war would be over.
perhaps... but then what would we do?
who would we be?
can we talk to somebody in charge? I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.
there's no need to treat us this way...
get the device operational.
I don't even know what it is!
Oh, great. It's sealed shut, and they've removed the door controls from this side.
where the hell are we?
I'd say judging by the Lantian architecture, I'd guess, you know, secret Janus facility.
which is, you know, probably bad for us, because it probably means it's hard to find.
so I guess that means no rescue any time soon.
does that look familiar to you?
Yeah, it's the device from the Atlantis lab.
at least we know why they brought us with them.
they need us to get the device operational. I caught that.
right, and I don't think we'll get any more info from talky MC says-a-lot out there, so fire up these consoles, see what we're dealing with.
not like that.
let's see. Yeah, like that.
and then I need to be right there, yep. Thanks. There.
we've got five jumpers in the air flying a defensive formation around the city and have the chair fired up and ready for you at a moment's notice.
I want marine details every five levels, locked and loaded, ready for my go-ahead, just in case.
Absolutely.
Colonel, I think I may have something.
I've been working under the assumption that, as you suggested, the device they took must have been broadcasting some sort of subspace communication.
you can trace it?
well, yeah, if it was broadcasting from Atlantis, yes.
but obviously it's not doing that anymore.
so... - so...
well, I'm using the work of Laszlo Babaias a stepping stone.
you know, combinatorics and, um... no offense, but the math I'm using is so complicated that I don't know if I can dumb it down enough for it to make sense.
try.
all right, well, okay, I've been going over our recorded subspace logs and I'm trying to extrapolate the single thread that will lead us to the area of space associated with the device.
well, I understand that.
it doesn't accurately represent what I'm doing, but
I get it. What you're doing is difficult. Just tell me when you get a hit.
this facility is tapped into some pretty serious power generation.
I've never seen anything like it before.
you'd need a lot of power...
what?
I think I know what this thing does. - What?
it's an endgame machine. - How so?
if it works the way I think it does, it would mean the end of the wraith once and for all.
so how do you destroy the wraith once and for all?
well, I never said "destroy." I mean, it would lead to that, I suppose, but this device would stop them dead in their tracks.
how?
it creates a very specific subspace static... turbulence is a better way of looking at it.
which... - okay, look.
although they're all based on a fairly similar technological premise, each race has a slightly different typeof hyperdrive.
ours are based on the asgard drives with our own little twist.
the ancients had their own system, and the wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology.
all right.
so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace.
okay, this much I already know, yes.
okay, so, if this machine is capable of actually functioning safely, it disruptsthe very specific subspace frequencies the wraith use.
so they wouldn't be able to engage their hyperdrives.
that's the genius-they would be able to.
it's just that their particular channel of subspace would be destabilized and the shipwould be ripped intoa million pieces.
when this device is turned on, every time a wraith ship enters hyperspace, it self-destructs?
Yeah. - That's a pretty effective idea.
Yeah. Because even if word got back to the other wraith that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives, they'd be stuck where they were.
they could only travel using sublight engines.
because ancient ships' hyperdrives operated on a different frequency of subspace, the ancients could fly around and pick them off one by one.
Yeah, or just leave them to die in the vastness of space.
so, what's the catch?
Ah, well, the catch is that Janus ran a three-day test about 10, 000 years ago and then shut the whole project down because of "unforeseen side effects."
right, which were?
well, it's not clear.
but that's the key to the whole shebang.
Janus brought that back to Atlantis but kept it connected to the main system here.
one won't work without the other.
they seem pretty convinced we can make it operational.
because we probably can. We have everything we need here.
the question is whether we should.
the last time I went down this road, I... I kind of destroyed a solar system.
Yeah, and I'm not too keen about experiencing those "unforeseen side effects."
so what do we do? - It's simple. We, uh... we reason with them?
now, obviously you're as excited about the possibility of ending the wraith's reign over this galaxy once and for all.
but the reality is this device and this facility were abandoned by their creator for a very good reason.
see, uh, it doesn't work... at least not safely.
that's from what my friend can tell.
look, we share the same goal.
perhaps we have many things in common.
look, given the right amount of time, it's possible we could get the device to function safely, but we'd have to contact our people and bring in a much larger science team.
see, I'm not that kind of scientist, and my friend here
get the device operational within one hour or I will kill him.
do you understand?
I understand. Yes.
great plan, Danny. Great plan.
why the suits?
huh?
well, they're not in battle anymore.
originally I thought it was just their version of swat gear, but they still have it on.
maybe they're more than just armor. Maybe they're some sort of protective suit.
maybe they can't function in our livable atmosphere.
maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing to do with the task at hand.
those suits might be the key to figuring out who these guys really are.
well, you work on understanding them. I'll work on trying not to get us killed.
well, you got something for me?
Yes. There. M6h-987. That's my best guess.
are you sure? - Well, about 80% sure.
it's our only lead. I'll have to do.
doesn't happen to have a gate on it, does it?
no.
of course not.
Daedalus still out of communications range?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
their rendezvous point with Ttodd isn't even near a stargate.
get to the jumper bay, boost its subspace communications range as much as you can.
what are you planning?
we've got to get to that planet as soon as possible.
we'll gate as near as we can to the Daedalus with a jumper, have them pick us up enroute to the planet.
okay. Give me half an hour.
I'm going to get the team ready.
that main chamber houses the subspace antenna.
it harnesses the static into subspace.
it will once I light it up.
what? You're already ready?
well, it wasn't broken.
he just shut it down.
all you need is that, a basic understanding of Janus' coding style, and here's where I come in again, the ancient gene.
we're ready to roll.
Rodney, you don't have to do this.
what?
if turning this thing on means a solar system is going to explode, then let's not.
they're going to kill you. We don't have a choice. - Yes, we do.
okay, so I do nothing, they come in here, they kill you. Who gets killed next, huh? Me.
to tell you the truth here, I'm quite fond of me, so might as well do it now while you're still alive as opposed to, you know, then.
all right.
all right.
you still alive?
I think so.
I'd hate to think heaven looks like this.
who says we went to heaven?
it's operational.
anything out of the ordinary?
no.
everything is in the green. I mean, it's working great.
what about those "unforeseen side effects"?
they're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still alive.
okay, so, what now?
uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back and an all-expense-paid trip back to Atlantis?
you have an urgent message from your hive.
I assumed you'd want to take it privately.
go ahead.
very well.
permission granted.
I shall remain here.
is everything okay?
one of our facilities is under attack by a rival hive.
our two support ships must depart for battle.
my hive will remain here, continue the work with dr. Keller.
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, not the under attack part, that's unfortunate, of course.
I just meant... never mind.
marks, what the hell just happened?
how did you do that?
how did we
surely you don't think we had anything to do with that.
you've tricked me.
what?
this was your plan all along.
somehow, you've found the Attero device.
the what? We have no idea what you
commander, we've been trying to contact you.
the other cruisers were destroyed.
I know. We've been betrayed.
what should we do?
I have control of the humans' transport system.
I'll begin beaming in our troops immediately.
we're taking this ship.
come on.
what's going on?
we're under attack. We got to get to the armory and get you a gun. Come on.
locked.
we're locked in.
that should limit their movements.
continue beaming in our troops.
10 minutes and counting. Still no problem.
Oh, boy... - what? What is it?
I think I just found a log entry that tells what the side effect is.
it's not harmful radiation, is it?
no. No, no, no. You and I are safe.
it's just the rest of the galaxy that's going to have problems, including Atlantis.
I've got to shut this thing down.
step away from the device.
okay, wait. There's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device, and we need to talk to your boss
okay, all set.
I'll have Chuck dial m5r-179.
you should be able to contact the Daedalus via subspace once you get there.
nice work.
Thanks. Good luck. - Thanks, we're going to need it.
all right, dial up.
what's that?
we've got a power spike at the event horizon.
what? Power is building within the gate?
no, no, no. That can't happen.
Colonel, do not lower the jumper into the gate room.
why not?
for some reason, there's an unprecedented power build-up within the gate.
power build-up from where?
it's coming from within the event horizon. Oh, no.
this is very, very bad for us.
just shut it down. It's probably a faulty gate at the other end.
I'm-- I'm trying. It won't let me.
all right, I'm coming down.
what do we do, wait 38 minutes and ride the puddle out?
I wish.
if the power continues to build like this, the gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
explode?
Yes, I told you it was very, very bad for us.
how does something like this happen?
I don't know. It's never happened before.
how long do we have? - Not long at all. About 90 seconds.
90 seconds?
I would say closer to 60.
we've got to evacuate everyone in the tower.
the gate exploding is equivalent to a dozen nuclear explosions.
there's nowhere we could evacuate quickly enough to a safe distance.
the-- the shield. - What?
collapse the city's shield around the gate, contain the explosion.
Yes, yes, that might just work.
the gate will reach a critical limit in five...
don't look at the blast!
might have mentioned that before!
I'll see if I can divert more power to the shield, see if I can block more of the radiation...
and now what?
the shield continues to diffuse the energy of the blast.
every second it's contained within the shield, the explosion gets weaker.
how long does it take?
Oh, no.
what?
the shield needs at least another minute to contain the full brunt of the blast, but we're frying out the emitters.
I don't know how much longer I can hold this.
shut down the city, transfer all the power.
Yes, I'm trying.
everyone that doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city.
move! Everybody!
you're going to want to get out of here.
John, I-- - Teyla, please.
come on, you can do it, Radek.
it's going down. We're going to make it.
no... it's not enough.
to be continued -=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
so I understand you have a proposal.
we've come up with a gene therapy that alters wraith DNA.
we think we can make it so that you will never need to feed on humans again.
here.
try this.
his name was Janus.
causality is not to be treated so lightly.
no one's treating it lightly.
you are.
you are insistent on continuing the experiment.
we order you to cease these activities.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
if we do this every time someone comes for a visit, we'd never get any work done.
we're just meeting him at the gate.
we're not just meeting him at the gate.
I've been pulled from my regular duties to help him with his database "research."
I've got stuff on the go, you know, important, vital projects for the betterment of the human race.
apparently there are other people doing equally important work, Rodney, as hard as that is to believe.
an exciting day.
Absolutely.
he's ready to beam.
very well.
Dr. Jackson, welcome to Atlantis.
thank you, Mr. Woolsey. It's great to be back.
Colonel Sheppard, Rodney...
I'll have Rodney here show you to your quarters.
actually, I'd like to get started right away, if that's okay with you, Rodney?
Oh, sure, sure.
what have you got planned?
an exciting exploration of insignificant ancient historical events?
no, not quite. I'm sure you're both familiar with the ancient named Janus?
the inventor? - Yes, he was the lead scientist and apparently a bit of a renegade.
Yeah, and I've been over all his logs.
look, this is work we've done already.
I'm pretty sure I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.
secret lab?
Yes, a place where he conducted and subsequently hid a significant portion of his unauthorized research.
and if I'm correct, it's right here... on Atlantis.
I've been over Janus' database entries with a fine-tooth comb.
I never saw any mention of a secret lab.
Janus was doing a lot of work that wasn't exactly approved by the ancient council, so it's not hard to imagine he wouldn't include a full accounting in this very public database.
do you include all of your research in your official reports?
just get to the point.
he never talked about it in his entries, but several of Janus' peers suspected he had a bastion of unfettered thought and experimentation, or as one of his lovers put it-- - he had lovers?
an isle of solitude within the city walls.
could just mean he was hard to talk to. People say things like that about me all the time.
none of these writers had any idea where the lab could be, but one of his young assistants recalls a day where Janus turned a corner down a hallway.
today I saw Janus in the hallway... there's a real page-turner.
he chased after him with a question, but when he rounded the corner, Janus was gone.
the hallway was a dead end. He had seemingly disappeared, I think, into his secret lab.
well, did this assistant happen to mention... which hallway? Yes. He does.
Yeah.
as soon as the Daedalus unloads its supplies, we'll be heading off to meet up with Todd and one of his hives.
you really think he's going to show up, huh?
and let you guys try out Dr. Keller's gene therapy on a few of his guys?
well, we held up our end of the deal.
we let him use Teyla to take control of an alliance of wraith hives.
that's what I'm saying, he's got what he wants.
I should go with you, because I have a relationship with Todd.
that is precisely why I don't want you there.
this mission is basically going to be a negotiation, and Todd has, well... less baggage with me than he does with you.
I'm not saying you shouldn't take the lead... you're second in command here, Colonel.
I know my predecessors played fast and loose with many of the rules set forth by the I. O.A.
but protocol plainly states that in the rare instance where I am required to leave Atlantis, you stay put.
you're in command here until I get back.
understood?
okay.
try not to blow her up while I'm gone.
no promises.
Yeah, I think this should be the last of it.
Hey.
Hi.
I was just leaving.
Yeah, I know.
here, let me get that.
Thanks.
so you're going on this Daedalus thing?
Yeah, uh... thank you.
I kind of have to. I'm the one that'll be administering the treatment... if, you know, we ever get to that point.
right.
I think I should come with you on this.
Really? Why?
I don't really trust these guys.
you don't trust Todd and his wraith or the entire crew of the Daedalus to protect me if something goes wrong?
I don't know.
both, I guess.
what?
nothing.
what? - Nothing, nothing.
it'd be great to have the company.
Bye, Rodney. Wish us luck.
good luck.
what do you mean, "us"?
is that a water line up there?
Yeah, this section of the city flooded the first year we were here.
anything salvageable got moved to the main tower.
it's remote. That's promising.
he wouldn't want anyone around when he came in and out of his lab, like the bat cave.
yes... just like the bat cave.
I'm not picking up anything unusual... something used to be attached here.
hmm. And here... and another one.
any idea what they are?
looks like a run-of-the-mill sconce interface.
right. Well, where are the sconces?
I don't know. Maybe the decorator changed his mind.
you said after the flood, anything worth salvaging was moved to the main tower.
now, please tell me you kept detailed records of what was found and where.
did we keep detailed records? Who are you talking to here?
there.
that's the hallway. Can you zoom in there?
there.
there are your light fixtures.
must have been knocked loose during the flood. - Possibly.
but you salvaged them, right? - They're lights that fell during a flood
just humor me, okay?
I think we're onto something.
all right.
here they are.
I've got them.
that's odd.
each of these three lights made a different tone when I plugged them in.
does that usually happen around here?
not usually, no.
they've been banged around a lot, underwater a few days.
maybe they're just broken.
no, it's a puzzle.
I think we need to activate these in a specific order.
a 3-digit code? You know how easy that would be to break?
there's only 6 variations.
maybe activate them a number of times in a specific order.
I don't suppose you recognize any of these three notes?
like, does it remind me of Janus' favorite Brian Eno track?
no. No such luck.
Janus' assistant said he disappeared pretty quickly down the hallway, so it can't be a long code.
maybe it's as simple as 3 tones in a row.
go for it.
hold on for a second.
what is it?
come here and push against this wall.
Why?
please. Just humor me. I think I'm on to something.
okay, on the count of three, push against the wall as hard as you can, okay?
okay.
son of a bitch.
controlled magnetic harmonic resonance.
what?
apparently tesla was close to something like this before Edison trashed his lab.
what are you talking about?
that wall was specially designed to destablize when bombarded with a very specific harmonic resonance.
that's what the tones were.
and the strong magnetic property of the particles is what keeps the door from just crumbling into dust.
it's a great way to hide a door, because if you're looking for a door to open, it's never going to be found.
it's like a hologram, only better, because it's solid mass until the tones are playing.
so you could have just told me to walk through the door.
I could have, yes. - Yes, yes.
where the hell are we?
Janus' secret lab.
alert the others.
the device has been activated.
Hey, Mr. Woolsey.
Dr. Keller.
where is your burly protector?
it's odd to see you without him nowadays.
he's in the lab.
what are you working on?
a speech.
what for?
well, this is a fairly momentous occasion.
the wraith will take a step forward, not only for their own benefit, but for that of the entire galaxy.
it's a historic day.
I just think it deserves some recognition.
what have you got so far?
today is an historic day.
it's a good place to start.
well, it's a work in progress.
whoa.
that's pretty cool.
harmonic resonance.
Yeah, I was told. But what happens if the sound goes off and you're in the middle of the wall?
the wall would break apart your body.
maybe we should-- - I've set up a sub-sonic tone generator outside.
the wall is now permanently open. Don't worry.
good.
so, what have we got?
the good news is it's definitely Janus' secret lab.
the bad news is getting in was the easy part.
there are levels of encryption on all data here that even the most paranoid NSA agent wouldn't use.
I mean, it is deep.
some of them are straight-up math ciphers, while others are ancient knowledge puzzles.
and until we start deciphering, there's no way to tell what any of this stuff does.
sounds like you guys make a good team, though.
Yeah.
well, I guess I'll go back to being the boss.
how's that going?
pretty boring, actually.
you're more than welcome to help us crack this first stream cipher.
you know, he could have been in Mensa.
why don't you contact me when you two geniuses have a breakthrough.
will do.
sir, we're being hailed.
open a channel.
this is colonel Caldwell of the earth ship Daedalus.
we're ready to receive your delegation.
the delegation is on their way.
marks, you have the bridge.
I'm going to meet our guests.
thank you for coming.
thank you for having us.
today is an historic day.
robert Grosseteste once said
I would like to get started as soon as possible.
Yes, of course.
but I wanted to recognize I have my doubts that your plan will be effective.
so shall we drop these unfounded pleasantries and get to work?
very well.
Dr. Keller, lead the way.
please, come with me.
robert who?
never mind.
you know, it's almost dawn.
if you want to call it a night...
what? No, no, no, I'm fine, fine.
but if you need to rest, I'll completely understand.
seriously, is everything a competition with you?
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
I just found you a secret lab full of really cool ancient stuff.
I kind of think that should score me some points.
okay, I will admit that I may have been a little brusque with you.
just a little.
the truth is, I really didn't think you would find anything.
well, that much I actually understand.
you do?
Yeah.
I've spent the majority of my professional life being ridiculed for my theories, most of which turned out to be correct, by the way.
I'm kind of used to it, Rodney.
doesn't that bother you?
I mean, no vindication, no recognition, no credit...
I could say the same thing about you.
the discoveries you've made, you probably could've won the nobel prizefive times over by now.
too true.
so, I guess none of us signed up to get famous, huh?
no, we did it for the money.
good one.
wait a minute-you don't get paid more than I do, do you?
do you?
hyperspace window just opened.
Daedalus isn't due back yet.
hyperspace window detected unknown IFF
get Sheppard.
Colonel Sheppard, sir? - Yeah, uh, just resting my eyes.
who said that?
I patched into the pa in your room, sir.
you're going to want to get up here.
what's going on?
we're tracking a small ship, in atmosphere. It's coming right for us.
get the jumpers in the air.
it's closing fast, sir. It'll be here in less than 10 seconds.
shields up. I still want the jumpers ready.
here it comes... that's impossible. - What did it just do?
it passed through the shield. - Yeah, but how did it do that?
I'm not sure, sir.
ancient ships can do it.
all right, tell Teyla and a team of marines to meet me at that pier.
they should be right in front of you.
don't move!
what's at the bottom of this tower?
Rodney, this is Sheppard. Come in.
Rodney! - What's up?
get out of there right now.
Why?
control room, what's the status of that ship?
I'm sorry, Colonel. They're gone.
is it alive? - You tell me.
I'm not getting any coherent readings.
perhaps we should put it under a medical scanner.
okay, do it. - Go get a gurney.
so is it true they took Rodney and Dr. Jackson?
Yeah.
what the hell happened?
we were attacked.
that much I got, thanks. By who?
I was kind of hoping you could tell me.
okay, there is no way this is a coincidence.
we discover Janus'super-secret lab, and less than24 hours later, a bunch of aliens show up, all guns blazing?
don't think that's a little odd?
now that you mention it... they knew exactly what they were looking for.
didn't waste any time, went straight for the lab.
when they came out, one of them was carrying a device.
unfortunately, we haven't had nearly enough time to go through everything we found in here, so there's no way of knowing exactly what they took.
all this stuff came on when Rodney and Dr. Jacksoncame in here.
pretty much. It activated probably in response to rodney's A.T.A. Gene. Why?
what if something in here has been broadcasting?
a subspace signal-it's the only possible answer.
what are you talking about? - We've come across them before.
they're a real-time, practically instantaneous link between two ancient devices.
they can be separated by, like, half a galaxy.
there's a bunch of aliens out there.
they stumble upon an ancient lab, probably built by Janus himself.
it's dormant. It's not working.
then one day, out of the blue, it activates.
so they're standing around, scratching their heads. They have no ideawhat's going on.
then they discover the subspace link.
they decide to follow it, they trace it back to us.
and then attack us and take two of our people hostage?
Rodney and Dr. Jackson were not the targets.
they were at the wrong place at the wrong time.
whatever that device was, that's what they were after.
all right, good theory. So what do we do?
well, we... we've got to get out of here.
we're probably on a ship traveling through hyperspace. Where are wegoing to go?
I'll think of something. - Really?
Yep. Always do.
Oh yeah, I tried that. They zap you when you touch them.
you could told me that before I touched it. - I could have, yes.
look, they stripped us of everything but the clothing on our backs and surrounded us with laser walls...
I'm not sure how much play we have here.
we've got one thing going for us, at least. - What's that?
we're not dead yet.
good point.
it's no good.
I'm still not getting any useful readings.
the suit is emitting some sort of E. M. Field that's disrupting the scanner.
I have no idea how to shut it off.
there's no way to penetrate the shield and see what's under there?
I'm afraid not.
do you think there's a human underneath all that armor?
impossible to say. Could be a robot.
one thing's for sure- it's not like anything we've ever seen before.
Dr. Weir did say that there were other technologically advanced societies that we have yet to encounter.
we've just made first contact.
what do you want me to do?
cut it open.
Ah, it's no good. I just dulled the blade.
the neck. - What?
looks like the softest part. Try the neck.
it's already dead, Radek. - We think.
just do it.
it's working!
get out. Everyone, get out!
everyone okay? - Yes.
somebody really wants to keep secret whatever's inside that suit.
we've run close to a hundred simulations based on full medical scans of the wraith we've had in captivity.
they've all been successful.
we both know very well that computer simulations and live trials are very different.
I don't think we're doing this cavalierly. I stand by the data. It will work.
perhaps it will.
the question is, do you want it to?
I do see the benefits.
even if we only used the therapy on some of my troops... say, those whose lives, thanks to this war, are expected to be short.
why waste perfectly good resources on them, yes?
but it will be very difficult for me to ask those around me to give themselves over for the good of the human race.
but it's for your benefit too.
if you don't have to rely on human feeding, the war would be over.
perhaps... but then what would we do?
who would we be?
can we talk to somebody in charge? I think there's been a bit of a misunderstanding.
there's no need to treat us this way...
get the device operational.
I don't even know what it is!
Oh, great. It's sealed shut, and they've removed the door controls from this side.
where the hell are we?
I'd say judging by the Lantian architecture, I'd guess, you know, secret Janus facility.
which is, you know, probably bad for us, because it probably means it's hard to find.
so I guess that means no rescue any time soon.
does that look familiar to you?
Yeah, it's the device from the Atlantis lab.
at least we know why they brought us with them.
they need us to get the device operational. I caught that.
right, and I don't think we'll get any more info from talky MC says-a-lot out there, so fire up these consoles, see what we're dealing with.
not like that.
let's see. Yeah, like that.
and then I need to be right there, yep. Thanks. There.
we've got five jumpers in the air flying a defensive formation around the city and have the chair fired up and ready for you at a moment's notice.
I want marine details every five levels, locked and loaded, ready for my go-ahead, just in case.
Absolutely.
Colonel, I think I may have something.
I've been working under the assumption that, as you suggested, the device they took must have been broadcasting some sort of subspace communication.
you can trace it?
well, yeah, if it was broadcasting from Atlantis, yes.
but obviously it's not doing that anymore.
so... - so...
well, I'm using the work of Laszlo Babaias a stepping stone.
you know, combinatorics and, um... no offense, but the math I'm using is so complicated that I don't know if I can dumb it down enough for it to make sense.
try.
all right, well, okay, I've been going over our recorded subspace logs and I'm trying to extrapolate the single thread that will lead us to the area of space associated with the device.
well, I understand that.
it doesn't accurately represent what I'm doing, but
I get it. What you're doing is difficult. Just tell me when you get a hit.
this facility is tapped into some pretty serious power generation.
I've never seen anything like it before.
you'd need a lot of power...
what?
I think I know what this thing does. - What?
it's an endgame machine. - How so?
if it works the way I think it does, it would mean the end of the wraith once and for all.
so how do you destroy the wraith once and for all?
well, I never said "destroy." I mean, it would lead to that, I suppose, but this device would stop them dead in their tracks.
how?
it creates a very specific subspace static... turbulence is a better way of looking at it.
which... - okay, look.
although they're all based on a fairly similar technological premise, each race has a slightly different typeof hyperdrive.
ours are based on the asgard drives with our own little twist.
the ancients had their own system, and the wraith, again, have their own separate hyperdrive technology.
all right.
so at its base level, a hyperdrive allows you to travel great distances by entering and exiting subspace.
okay, this much I already know, yes.
okay, so, if this machine is capable of actually functioning safely, it disruptsthe very specific subspace frequencies the wraith use.
so they wouldn't be able to engage their hyperdrives.
that's the genius-they would be able to.
it's just that their particular channel of subspace would be destabilized and the shipwould be ripped intoa million pieces.
when this device is turned on, every time a wraith ship enters hyperspace, it self-destructs?
Yeah. - That's a pretty effective idea.
Yeah. Because even if word got back to the other wraith that the ships should stop using their hyperdrives, they'd be stuck where they were.
they could only travel using sublight engines.
because ancient ships' hyperdrives operated on a different frequency of subspace, the ancients could fly around and pick them off one by one.
Yeah, or just leave them to die in the vastness of space.
so, what's the catch?
Ah, well, the catch is that Janus ran a three-day test about 10, 000 years ago and then shut the whole project down because of "unforeseen side effects."
right, which were?
well, it's not clear.
but that's the key to the whole shebang.
Janus brought that back to Atlantis but kept it connected to the main system here.
one won't work without the other.
they seem pretty convinced we can make it operational.
because we probably can. We have everything we need here.
the question is whether we should.
the last time I went down this road, I... I kind of destroyed a solar system.
Yeah, and I'm not too keen about experiencing those "unforeseen side effects."
so what do we do? - It's simple. We, uh... we reason with them?
now, obviously you're as excited about the possibility of ending the wraith's reign over this galaxy once and for all.
but the reality is this device and this facility were abandoned by their creator for a very good reason.
see, uh, it doesn't work... at least not safely.
that's from what my friend can tell.
look, we share the same goal.
perhaps we have many things in common.
look, given the right amount of time, it's possible we could get the device to function safely, but we'd have to contact our people and bring in a much larger science team.
see, I'm not that kind of scientist, and my friend here
get the device operational within one hour or I will kill him.
do you understand?
I understand. Yes.
great plan, Danny. Great plan.
why the suits?
huh?
well, they're not in battle anymore.
originally I thought it was just their version of swat gear, but they still have it on.
maybe they're more than just armor. Maybe they're some sort of protective suit.
maybe they can't function in our livable atmosphere.
maybe we should just add it to the list of things that have nothing to do with the task at hand.
those suits might be the key to figuring out who these guys really are.
well, you work on understanding them. I'll work on trying not to get us killed.
well, you got something for me?
Yes. There. M6h-987. That's my best guess.
are you sure? - Well, about 80% sure.
it's our only lead. I'll have to do.
doesn't happen to have a gate on it, does it?
no.
of course not.
Daedalus still out of communications range?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
their rendezvous point with Ttodd isn't even near a stargate.
get to the jumper bay, boost its subspace communications range as much as you can.
what are you planning?
we've got to get to that planet as soon as possible.
we'll gate as near as we can to the Daedalus with a jumper, have them pick us up enroute to the planet.
okay. Give me half an hour.
I'm going to get the team ready.
that main chamber houses the subspace antenna.
it harnesses the static into subspace.
it will once I light it up.
what? You're already ready?
well, it wasn't broken.
he just shut it down.
all you need is that, a basic understanding of Janus' coding style, and here's where I come in again, the ancient gene.
we're ready to roll.
Rodney, you don't have to do this.
what?
if turning this thing on means a solar system is going to explode, then let's not.
they're going to kill you. We don't have a choice. - Yes, we do.
okay, so I do nothing, they come in here, they kill you. Who gets killed next, huh? Me.
to tell you the truth here, I'm quite fond of me, so might as well do it now while you're still alive as opposed to, you know, then.
all right.
all right.
you still alive?
I think so.
I'd hate to think heaven looks like this.
who says we went to heaven?
it's operational.
anything out of the ordinary?
no.
everything is in the green. I mean, it's working great.
what about those "unforeseen side effects"?
they're still unforeseen. For now, it's working, and we're still alive.
okay, so, what now?
uh, maybe, uh, a nice pat on the back and an all-expense-paid trip back to Atlantis?
you have an urgent message from your hive.
I assumed you'd want to take it privately.
go ahead.
very well.
permission granted.
I shall remain here.
is everything okay?
one of our facilities is under attack by a rival hive.
our two support ships must depart for battle.
my hive will remain here, continue the work with dr. Keller.
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, not the under attack part, that's unfortunate, of course.
I just meant... never mind.
marks, what the hell just happened?
how did you do that?
how did we
surely you don't think we had anything to do with that.
you've tricked me.
what?
this was your plan all along.
somehow, you've found the Attero device.
the what? We have no idea what you
commander, we've been trying to contact you.
the other cruisers were destroyed.
I know. We've been betrayed.
what should we do?
I have control of the humans' transport system.
I'll begin beaming in our troops immediately.
we're taking this ship.
come on.
what's going on?
we're under attack. We got to get to the armory and get you a gun. Come on.
locked.
we're locked in.
that should limit their movements.
continue beaming in our troops.
10 minutes and counting. Still no problem.
Oh, boy... - what? What is it?
I think I just found a log entry that tells what the side effect is.
it's not harmful radiation, is it?
no. No, no, no. You and I are safe.
it's just the rest of the galaxy that's going to have problems, including Atlantis.
I've got to shut this thing down.
step away from the device.
okay, wait. There's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device, and we need to talk to your boss
okay, all set.
I'll have Chuck dial m5r-179.
you should be able to contact the Daedalus via subspace once you get there.
nice work.
Thanks. Good luck. - Thanks, we're going to need it.
all right, dial up.
what's that?
we've got a power spike at the event horizon.
what? Power is building within the gate?
no, no, no. That can't happen.
Colonel, do not lower the jumper into the gate room.
why not?
for some reason, there's an unprecedented power build-up within the gate.
power build-up from where?
it's coming from within the event horizon. Oh, no.
this is very, very bad for us.
just shut it down. It's probably a faulty gate at the other end.
I'm-- I'm trying. It won't let me.
all right, I'm coming down.
what do we do, wait 38 minutes and ride the puddle out?
I wish.
if the power continues to build like this, the gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
explode?
Yes, I told you it was very, very bad for us.
how does something like this happen?
I don't know. It's never happened before.
how long do we have? - Not long at all. About 90 seconds.
90 seconds?
I would say closer to 60.
we've got to evacuate everyone in the tower.
the gate exploding is equivalent to a dozen nuclear explosions.
there's nowhere we could evacuate quickly enough to a safe distance.
the-- the shield. - What?
collapse the city's shield around the gate, contain the explosion.
Yes, yes, that might just work.
the gate will reach a critical limit in five...
don't look at the blast!
might have mentioned that before!
I'll see if I can divert more power to the shield, see if I can block more of the radiation...
and now what?
the shield continues to diffuse the energy of the blast.
every second it's contained within the shield, the explosion gets weaker.
how long does it take?
Oh, no.
what?
the shield needs at least another minute to contain the full brunt of the blast, but we're frying out the emitters.
I don't know how much longer I can hold this.
shut down the city, transfer all the power.
Yes, I'm trying.
everyone that doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city.
move! Everybody!
you're going to want to get out of here.
John, I-- - Teyla, please.
come on, you can do it, Radek.
it's going down. We're going to make it.
no... it's not enough.
to be continued -=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
you're both familiar with the ancient named janus.
the inventor.
I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.
we were attacked.
by who.
I was hoping you could tell me.
get the device operational within one hour or I will kill him.
do you understand?
somehow, you've found the attero device.
what.
we're locked in?
wait, there's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device, and we need to talk to your boss.
if the power continues to build like this, the gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
everyone that doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city.
it's not enough.
move quickly.
we have to get everyone to the lower levels of the tower to make sure that everyone will be
Colonel sheppard, are you all right?
how many were up there?
two
I'll go get my people.
they were right here when I left them.
if the explosion was hot enough, there might not be anything left for us to find.
did you hear that?
we didn't take cover.
are you all right?
are you all right?
my ears.
I think I've got a some glass in my back we lost the stargate, we lost the control room That's bad.
but we did not lose you.
that's good.
okay.
all the troops you've requested have beamed onboard.
have them round up the rest of the humans and confine them to one of the hangar bays.
inform our hive to wait for us here, and under no circumstances are they to activate their hyperdrive
is that understood?
Yes.
I need you to get banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control room below the damaged areas.
they've already begun.
how are you?
I'm alive.
you know, that's good for now.
I still do not understand what happened.
the gate blew up.
that much I surmised.
but why?
I don't know.
where the hell's mckay when you need him, huh?
all right.
so the device creates a very specific subspace "turbulence"that makes it impossible.
for the wraith to operate their hyperdrives.
you said that already.
but there's a side effect.
the "unforeseen" one that janus mentions.
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here because there's no stargate on this planet.
what's the point, Rodney.
although the subspace turbulence only affects the wraith's hyperdrive systems.
it creates a very dangerous type of radiation that.
well the messes with the basic operation of the stargates.
stargates.
what, as in all of them?
all of the stargates in the pegasus network, yes.
and when you say "messes with," you mean what?
look, when dialed, power will build up inside the gate until it overloads.
so you're saying that as long as this janus device is running.
every time someone dials a gate in the entire galaxy-- it'll explode.
millions of people will die if we don't shut that thing down.
good timing, Mr Woolsey.
look.
I don't know what it is you think we've done, but I assure you.
take us out of hyperspace.
we haven't arrived at atlantis yet.
we're within communications range.
we don't want to get too close.
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.
well, are we up and running.
Yes, sir We've routed .all the city's main controls into this room
at least we're not blind anymore.
no, but we're severely crippled.
without the gate or the ability to reach the daedalus.
we have no way of getting to m6h-987 or rescuing rodney and Dr Jackson.
what should we do 5 bucks to anyone who figures out how to contact daedalus.
Colonel sheppard.
you got an idea, banks.
well, no, but I am being hailed by the daedalus on subspace.
does that count.
technically that's not your idea, but good enough Put 'em on screen.
I'll pay you later.
Daedalus, it's good to, uh-- colonel sheppard.
what the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?
I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty [Whispering]: How close are they?
not close enough to go by jumper.
don't worry, I'm more than willing to return this ship and its crew to you.
in exchange for what?
you've activated the attero device.
I need you to shut it down and give me its location immediately.
I don't know what you're talking about.
it was very clever of you, luring me and my ship out into the open so you could see for yourself if it worked.
if what worked.
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed.
I was there 10, 000 years ago when the ancients first tried to use it.
but they didn't have the stomach to leave it on once they realized how.
many of their precious stargates it would destroy and how many humans it would kill.
sounds like something janus would have worked on.
give me the location of the attero device, and once I have destroyed it, I will return this crew to .
look, it's not what you think ee have nothing to do with this.
every minute that goes by without you telling me where this device is, I will kill a member of your expedition.
your time starts now.
give us a second.
I don't think this should count toward the minute.
I-- I mean, he didn't say no yet.
what are the odds that-- what's this thing called?
uh, attero device.
what are the odds that this thing was at the other end of the subspace link that rodney opened when he went to that lab?
m6h-987 Very likely
it's also very likely that's where he and Dr Jackson were taken.
it must be a weapon that janus developed during the wraith war.
a weapon to blow up stargates.
I doubt that was its original design.
it doesn't seem like an effective strategy.
so, a nasty side effect.
that's probably why they stopped production.
whatever the aliens took from the lab allowed them to reactivate it again.
whatever it is, todd seems pretty keen to stop it, enough to risk taking the daedalus.
Yes, but we can't give him the address.
if he gets it, he'll destroy everything in his path, including rodney and Dr Jackson.
John, we don't have a choice.
our shield was able to take the brunt of the explosion, but if this is happening on other worlds
it could kill millions.
put 'em back on.
Oh, thank god.
we're not the ones behind this.
very well.
w-w-wait.
I said, we're not the ones behind this, but we may have what you need.
Atlantis was attacked yesterday, by a race we have not encountered before.
they stole a piece of ancient technology.
we believe this could be a component to this attero device.
we managed to track them.
you swing by here, pick me up, I will take you there myself.
and give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your drones I think not.
why would I do that?
right now, you're one of the few people in the galaxy with a ship capable of dealing with this problem.
and I intend to keep it that way.
John sheppard, transmit the coordinates or I will feed on Mr Woolsey before your eyes.
do it.
we have it.
we'll be in touch.
you really think that's going to work.
you got a better idea.
we're on a space ship.
those doors are designed to be airtight.
that means something as tiny as air can't even get through.
how do you think you will?
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.
yeah that's kind of my point.
see.
you okay?
Yeah.
all right Come on.
wait What's our plan Where are we going.
get to an access ladder, head down two floors to the engineering rooms.
then we cripple the ship.
you know how to do all that.
yeah Don't you?
not really.
watch and learn.
hyperspace window opening.
think Todd changed his mind.
he might have realized just how crippled we are.
we're being hailed.
put it up.
my name is Katana Labrea.
I'm a traveler.
Larrin sent me.
well, is everything all right.
no, as a matter of fact, it's not.
Larrin was hoping you could tell us why the stargates are blowing up?
cici you Come with me.
me Why?
we'll both go no need for that.
no.
I guess it just must be your turn to use the fitness room.
all right.
good luck.
you too.
it was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a hundred generations and it was leveled in an instant.
I was in orbit when it happened.
we could see the explosion from space.
I've never witnessed anything that powerful.
the gates are made of naquadah.
when they become unstable, the size of the explosion is unimaginable.
we lost 3, 000 people and two ships, including our ancient vessel.
Larrin would have come herself, but-- no, I'm sure she's got her hands full.
look, these aliens or whoever they are, they have two of our people hostage.
they need to be stopped.
we have coordinates, but we have no ship.
then I guess I got here just in time.
that's what I wanted to hear.
Zelenka, you're with me.
John --Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right
the second Todd's done, there's nothing stopping him from turning that ship around and making a run at Atlantis.
I need somebody I can trust to stay in charge here.
good luck.
I locked the door.
this won't take long.
so what do we do.
bring up the main control systems and disable them one by one.
that's one way to go.
well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe, though.
otherwise they could just turn them back on again
do you have some sort of a passcode to make sure they're locked out once and for all?
Nope.
well, then, what are you thinking.
we just dropped out of hyperspace.
I see that, yes.
Why?
I'm not sure.
the computer seems to think it's due to battle damage.
get our troops down to the engineering room.
someone's sabotaging this ship.
wh-- what are you doing?
disabling the ship.
you can't just blast away at vital systems like that
what if you take out the life support system.
don't worry The life support system is that tray.
at least, I'm pretty sure it is.
okay, we're out of hyperspace That's enough Come on.
you wish to speak to me.
you're the leader.
you need to shut this device down immediately.
no, I do not.
okay, look, I understand wanting to destroy the wraith I do.
but this isn't the way.
I disagree.
okay, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but this device has a serious side effect.
it makes stargates explode when they're activated.
we do not use the stargates.
okay.
but lots of other people do.
they are of no concern to us.
so you're just going to let them die, millions of people, across the galaxy.
you're no better than the wraith.
perhaps. But we have little choice.
Why?
our planet is dying.
it can no longer sustain us.
for the first time in countless generations, we must venture out into this galaxy again, a galaxy controlled by the wraith.
if we do not destroy them, they will destroy us.
this is the way it must be.
the wraith are ahead of us.
as soon as they get to that planet, they'll open up with everything they've got.
trust me, they ain't going to be worried about collateral damage.
the only chance we have to save our friends is to get there first.
you want speed.
you've come to the right place.
this is your engineering room.
that's right.
it may not look like much, but trust me, we can outrun most anything in the traveler fleet.
this is colonel sheppard and dr Zelenka.
they're from Atlantis.
mila's our chief engineer.
she can't be more than 16 years old 15, actually.
she's been working on ships since she was four.
we need to get where we're going as fast as possible.
I want you to do whatever you can to maximize hyperdrive output.
no problem.
you know, uh, Zelenka knows a thing or two about hyperdrives himself.
I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a hand.
who knows, maybe you'll learn a thing or two
the damage is significant.
begin repairs.
every second the attero device is active, we risk losing more and more of our alliance.
it has come to my attention that someone from the original crew has eluded capture.
your freedom has become a nuisance.
turn yourself in immediately or we will begin killing off your friends one by one.
you have three minutes to comply.
he's bluffing.
no, he's not.
where are you going.
I'm turning myself in.
no, you're not.
he's going to start killing people.
he's going to kill you.
well, I hope not.
we need to get armed, free these people, and take this ship back.
exactly I turn myself in, and he'll think he's got us all.
it buys you the time you need to do what you've got to do.
no.
no, I'm not letting you do it.
Ronon, listen to me-- Jennifer, no.
okay.
you're right.
okay.
come on.
we're almost there anyways.
we're talking about the deaths of millions of people.
how can you be so callous.
and what is it you're so afraid of.
why-- why are you still in your battle armor?
I can't hurt you.
I know you're not human.
you're definitely not wraith.
and if you were an ancient, you wouldn't have needed our help to activate the device so...
what are you?
you're asgard.
you've encountered our kind before.
no, not just encountered.
I've worked with them, even called a few of them my friends.
indeed.
of course, the asgard I knew were a noble race who actually helped the human population in my galaxy.
and where are they now?
dead.
but that had nothing to do with us.
are you certain?
they were clones-- copies of copies of copies, going back generations, and they suffered irreversible genetic degradation as a result.
but you probably already know that.
of course, because we are clones as well, subject to the same law of diminishing returns.
and yet, we are still very much alive.
so, what, you solved the problem?
not entirely.
but once we were able to conduct our research without interference, we made significant progress.
research on humans because our physiology is similar to what yours used to be.
precisely.
I take that back.
I have met an asgard like you before.
his name was Loki, and he was experimenting on humans too, until he was caught and brought to justice by the asgard high council.
because they did not believe the ends justified the means.
that's right.
and look where it got them.
well, how's it coming? It does that sometimes.
don't let it bother you.
listen, what we are doing here is not safe.
what else is new.
she is pushing this ship well past its boundaries.
that's kind of what we asked for, no.
if we don't get Rodney and Danny back before Todd gets there, they're goners.
this is the crudest hyperdrive system I've ever encountered.
it is cobbled together from mismatching components.
she's got to be pretty smart to put a hyperdrive together with mismatched parts.
she's going to burn it up.
once out of hyperspace, there's a high possibility we won't be able to engage the drive again.
let's worry about that when we get there.
what was that.
just a radiation warning.
the detector's a little over-sensitive.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I've got to get back to the bridge.
I'll leave you to it.
we came to this galaxy during the war.
with both the wraith and the ancients occupied, we were free to conduct our experiments.
unfortunately, the hostilities came to an end sooner than we thought, and with an unexpected result.
you were betting on the ancients.
they may have tried to shut you down, but at least they wouldn't exterminate you.
the wraith do not tolerate the presence of advanced technologies other than their own.
before we knew what was happening, we were under attack.
we lost our intergalactic ships in the first battle, and we did not have the resources to build more.
so how did you survive?
we had no choice but to abandon our settlements and retreat to a place where the wraith could not look for us.
a planet with a toxic atmosphere.
that sounds nice.
it was tolerable at first.
we were able to survive using simple breathing apparatus.
but over the eons, the environment has grown so harsh that not even our armored exoskeletons can protect us now.
so you ventured back into the galaxy, and that's when you came across this place.
we knew it was built by the ancients, and why, but we were unable to activate it until you came along.
look, I-- I'm sorry that you were trapped on a poisonous planet for the last 10, 000 years.
I really am.
I'm sure it was awful.
but that doesn't justify what you're doing.
my people are dying.
the fact that, as you tell us, our brothers are already gone, only reinforces the need.
if we do not do this, our whole civilization, a hundred thousand years of history, will be wiped out forever.
I cannot allow that to happen.
Dr. Keller You're the saboteur.
that's right.
Where's your weapon?
my weapon.
yes The one you used to destroy the crystal trays.
I ditched it.
you really think I'd want it ending up in your hands.
Oh, it's foolish of you to see me as the enemy.
really. Why's that?
I'm on a mission from your colonel sheppard.
I seriously doubt that.
it is a long story, but he has requested that we neutralize a very dangerous target.
then why did you take over the ship.
why did you attack our crew.
as I said, it is a long story.
the mission, however, is time-sensitive, and you have handed us a major setback.
hyperdrive, weapons, shields-- they are all down.
that's a real shame.
it is considering that hundreds of thousands of humans could die because of it.
I would think that will weigh heavily on you in the future.
what are you talking about?
hyperdrive's coming back up.
and weapons.
irreparably damaged.
they're no good to us anymore.
I guess you won't be able to finish the mission, then.
Oh, we'll find a way.
get us back into hyperspace and get her down with the others.
you okay?
I thought you were a goner.
I'm all right.
I mean, they need me.
you're kind of expendable.
I just figured-- yeah, I got what you meant by "goner."
what did they want?
uh, to talk, actually.
how did that go?
they're asgard.
for real?
Yeah, a faction that broke off from the guys we knew thousands of years ago.
they're the ones inside the suits.
I did not see that one coming.
apparently no fans of the wraith, either.
are they going to shut off the device.
um, no.
then I don't care.
as long as that thing is on, then millions of people could die.
besides, I think I've figured a way out of here.
Really?
this is an ancient facility, and rodney mckay knows a thing or two about ancient facilities.
it has been clinically proven-- referring to yourself in the third person is a sign of mental instability.
mentally unstable like a fox.
okay, so, here's the plan.
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.
the system suddenly goes dead, it assumes there could be a fire, detects lifesigns inside the room.
it unlocks the doors for safety.
good job.
good thing they brought you back when they did, because I assumed you were dead and I was going to leave.
lucky me.
so, what do we do now?
we've got to shut down the device.
how do we do that?
we'll just we'll improvise.
right.
Todd didn't kill you?
no, but you almost got me killed.
I've never fired one of these outside of the range before.
you did great.
good work.
it's not over yet.
there's an armory down the hall.
we need everyone we can.
we're taking this ship back.
we need to create a diversion.
I'm alears.
okay, uh, we go to the power relay station, we create a massive explosion.
I never got how that made a good diversion.
what?
you want to clear the device control room of bad guys, right?
Yes.
why assume if there was a massive explosion people would run towards it?
I would.
I rest my case.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a good person.
I'd want to save people from the fire, maybe figure out what was going on.
I'd order more guards to protect the one room I thought whoever is blowing things up probably wants to get to.
explosion diversions are the very cornerstone of diversions.
you don't have any better ideas.
I don't have any better ideas, yes.
Oh, my god.
please don't kill me.
you need me.
Rodney. - Us, us.
you need us.
the device needs constant care.
true, I'm the only one who knows how to work it-- what am I talking about killing for.
you're not a violent race.
you may have stunned us-- rodney.
more than we'd have liked, but-- they're just suits.
suits that house one of the smartest races ever.
I've always been a big fan of the asgards.
some of my best friends are asgards-- they're empty suits.
see.
yeah I know I was...
you were?
Yeah, it's not important.
from what I could tell, the inside of the suits form around whoever's in them.
one size fits all.
you sure you have all that figured out?
I've flown birds a lot harder to manage than this one.
I'm surprised larrin didn't say anything.
Larrin's never brought you up before today.
really never?
Nope.
we're about to come out of hyperspace.
everyone, get ready.
see, I knew this would happen.
we burned it out.
we got here, though, didn't we?
any sign of the daedalus?
no.
looks like we beat them.
that's the first good news I've had all day.
wait, I've got two ships closing in.
shields up.
fire at will.
evasive maneuvers might be good.
I'm on it.
clear.
how come we haven't run into any of them yet?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
do a lifesigns scan, find out where they are.
I have a mass of lifesigns in the second 302 bay.
they fell back to their ship.
it's still in the bay.
why would they do that? They saw we'd armed up.
didn't want to risk a fight?
that doesn't sound like Todd.
I'm going to check it out.
take us out of hyperspace.
what is it?
they locked us out of flight controls.
can you get us back in?
not quickly.
what's he got planned?
okay, how long to get the device shut down?
five minutes.
all right, look.
you watch the-- oh, come on.
what?
what now?
well, something must have spooked them.
Why?
well, aside from encrypting the access to this workstation yeah, but you can break that.
Yeah, in a heartbeat, but, as they very well know, you can't operate this machine without the control key.
look-- the thing they stole from janus' lab to begin with.
they've taken it.
one down, one to go.
I'm picking up a third ship headed right for us.
wonderful.
that was close.
it flew into hyperspace.
what?
hold on, I've got another window opening.
they're coming right back at us.
what kind of messed-up battle technique is that?
it's quite a bit out, nowhere near the planet yet.
wait it's the Daedalus.
contact them.
we're going to need the help.
Colonel Sheppard.
surprised to see all of you guys.
same here.
look, I'm on a travelers-- I'm on a travelers ship.
we've engaged the enemy.
have you gotten the Daedalus back?
because we're going to need the help.
Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight.
but he's locked us out of the controls and retreated to one of the 302 bays.
why the hell would he do that?
he needs that place destroyed more than anyone.
Mr. Woolsey, sir.
what is it, Marks?
sir, the second we came out of hyperspace, a pre-programmed sub-routine kicked in.
meaning our main scanners located a facility on the planet and immediately locked the guidance system into it.
it's taking us to the attero device.
in a way sir, it's programmed a collision course.
that's how he's going to destroy the facility, by ramming us into it.
can't we just power down the entire facility?
