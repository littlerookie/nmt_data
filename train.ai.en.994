make it look like she got loose and killed the others, but not before they fatally shot her first.
Thanks, Birkhoff.
listen, whatever you guys are going to do, do it fast, because Amanda is definitely going to be on to us now.
welcome to Division.
start the clock.
Stirling, report in.
send the kill signal, and trigger the nanotoxin now.
Birkhoff, how is he?
he's--he's dead, but, not the way you think.
we had to flatline him to kill the nanotoxin.
what? What about the antidote?
they, uh, they never got it.
it's okay, though. Alex is on top of it.
20 minutes, and they're going to bring him back.
I'm on my way. Birkhoff, listen to me.
don't let him die. Do you understand?
don't you dare let him die.
we sent out a signal but never got a valid response.
the nanotoxin was never activated.
there's a group of gentlemen I hired for quite a bit of money recently.
former employees, actually. They're on standby.
I'd like you to tell them it's time to go to work.
what orders shall I give them?
tell them to return to Division and wipe everyone out.
one, two, three, four, five.
150
clear.
adrenaline.
200
clear.
there.
damn it!
perimeter ALERT
guys, we have multiple hostiles incoming.
they are well-armed.
judging from their cover formation, they're well-trained.
damn it.
come on, Michael. Michael, come on!
son of a
Nikki, I've gotta go. We're under attack.
it's the rest of the Dirty 30s.
if you've got any power-ups left for that car, now's the time to use them.
everybody, we've got bad guys on the way down.
you guys go.
I'll stay with Michael.
it's Okay. Go. - OKay.
who are they? - I caught a couple faces.
dirty 30s are attacking us?
Amanda. She's got Shop money now.
she can afford them.
let's get them away from medical.
fall back!
how you like me now?
clear!
I'm out.
me too.
I got three rounds.
make them count.
draw them up top.
we'll flank them.
I got something I want to say.
I never liked you guys.
well, then, you got nothing to lose.
we'll be fine. Go.
go.
he's been down for so long.
I don't know if his body's strong enough.
all right. Okay.
he's strong enough. Come on, Michael.
give him the adrenaline. Now.
do you remember when I told you that you were the strongest person I'd ever met?
we were standing in the snow.
we'd just gotten Kasim, and you told me about the life he took from you.
and I thought, how could anyone survive that?
you did.
you did.
and then you saved me, too.
Michael, you pulled me out of the darkness when there was no other way.
and I need you to be strong for me right now.
if you want to save me...
save yourself.
please.
all of you went through that?
manhunt
as the nation continues to mourn President Spencer's death, the country's law enforcement agencies have launched the largest manhunt in history as they begin the search for the assassin.
the Secret Service has released the following description.
female, dark hair, roughly 5'7."
they've also released an image, taken from security camera footage within the White House.
the image is grainy, but take a close look.
if you have any information regarding this person, you are asked to contact local authorities.
we're going to clear your name.
no question. They got nothing.
that could be Bigfoot.
they'll find a better image.
we'll expose the truth before that happens.
the problem will be getting people to believe it.
I know the truth, and I can hardly believe it.
that's why we need to get to the bottom of what's really going on...
find out why Amanda and the group wanted the President dead, how they made her commit suicide.
those answers are what's going to clear Nikita's name.
we'll need somewhere to work from.
do you think maybe you could convince your hacker buddies to let us use this place for a while?
we're going to need a safehouse, since we lost those presidential pardons.
I'm putting you all in the line of fire.
we can handle it.
no. This will be heat like we've never seen before.
bring it on.
Nikita, we can beat this.
I was ready to die today, but you and Alex and everyone refused to let that happen.
you remember when Amanda tried to teach us that our loved ones were a liability?
well, it's a good thing you've got more than one.
okay.
till death do us part, right?
a toast to a successful beginning.
Nikita's still alive.
we tend not to view these things as zero-sum games.
what needed to happen happened.
the President is dead.
at least, to the outside world.
you should know that I am worthless as a hostage.
the United States will not negotiate with terrorists.
typical of an American to think she's being held as some type of leverage.
it is understandable.
grabbing her, as you did, at the G20, she probably suspects some foreign enemy.
it could all come crashing down because of Nikita.
we could release a clearer image, make sure people know who they're chasing.
no, meddling now would raise too many questions.
remember, we are the Invisible Hand.
Nikita has a habit of chopping off hands.
then we shall grow another.
these are all Shop facilities.
Yup. - A lot of these locations correspond to known hubs for human trafficking.
maryam Hasan offered me a position at the U. N. to work on the global trafficking problem.
if I took it, I'd have the influence and cover to get us into a lot of these places.
you want to be a diplomat?
it'd be a chance for Alexandra Udinov to do some good.
make the name into something that I could finally be proud of.
and it'll help us nail the people working with Amanda and get us closer to clearing Nikita's name.
that's not a bad strategy.
she was right here.
come on, Nikita.
answer your damn phone.
answer, damn it.
answer your phone.
tonight.
hugh Grant stars in our reasonably-priced car and is the new Audi TT any good?
we find out by playing golf.
hello and welcome!
thank you for that!
thank you.
now
now as I'm sure you know...
as I'm sure you know，
James May is the slowest man in the entire world
by the time he sets off anywhere normally his hair has grown another inch.
so, plainly，
he was the ideal man to try and max the fastest car in the world.
Vlad the impaler" is back.
last year, the mighty Bugatti Veyron stared in our greatest Top Gear Challenge ever when it raced an air-plane across the continent.
in that film, Jeremy talked endlessly about the Veyron's ferocious power and its incredible top speed.
because he was on public road he had to stick to the speed limit.
Hahahaha.
but today, we're not just going to talk about it.
we are going to do it.
we're going to take the fastest production car in the world up to its top speed.
its top speed is 253 mph.
much faster than a formular 1 car.
and when you think that the Veyron has air-bags, air-conditioning, a stereo, a boot and all the other stuff F1 cars aren't burdened with.
you realize what an increadible machine this is!
the Veyron is about pushing the outside of the envelop
it's about doing things that people said just were not possible
this car is a sort of "Concord" moment.
getting cars to do 155 mph frankly isn't really very difficult.
the Veyron needs just a piffling 270 bhp to reach that speed.
but 253!
crikey!
the faster you go, the more Mother Nature tries to hold you back
so to do the next 100 mph the 100 mhp that takes you up to 250.
needs another 730 Bhp.
so what you end up with is a 16-cylinder engine with 4 turbo chargers producing 1001 horse power.
and a lot of heat.
that's why your car has 1 radiator and this car has 10.
the engineers really worried uncharted territory in this car.
here is an example, when they wanted to sort out the high speed dynamics
they went to the Sauber F1 Team and they said "If you don't mind awfully,can we use your wind tunnel or not?"
and they said "Terribly sorry, but we can't go up to those speeds
in fact, cracking 253 mph causes nighimare after nightmaire.
but Bugatti insists that this 850, 000 pound car can do it.
mind you, actually testing their bold claim is a bit of a palaver.
this is Ehra-Lessien
Volkswagon's maximum security test track in Germany
when it was built during the cold war
it was delibrately sited in a no fly zone near the east German border in order to stop prying eyes from seeing secret prototypes
it has over 16 miles of private track.
but the bit we are interested in is the main straight, which is a whopping 5. 5 miles long.
although it is technically a flat and level road.
you stand here, you can't actually see the other end and that's because it's following the curvature of the earth.
but even when you've sorted the venue you can't just jump in the car and go.
this is Germany, there are procedures to go through.
I like procedures.
you have to insert a special key into a slot by the door.
and when you do, the diffuser flaps close.
the rear spoiler retracts and the whole car hunkers down to became as slippery as possible
the telemetry box we're using to record the speed measures in kilometers an hours.
so the magic number we are looking for is 407
right, ladies and gentleman
here we go. I'm approaching the banking on the top of the circuit
I have to do this in 200 kph
that's about 120
round the banking and look for my acceleration point ,then give it the beans down the straight 200 kph, that's 120
to get the car settled fourth gear 5000 revs
looking for the exit where I bury it.
here we go!
the climb from 200 to 300 kph was over in just 9. 4 seconds
the world, viewers, is a total blur!
I'm already doing 330 Kph
going too quick, I can't do the math.
gettng up to about 350
captain Slow is doing 360 kph... 370
that's 230 miles per hour.
I was now leaving F1 cars behind
it's no wonder Micheal Schumacher retired.
he's slower than me!
at this sort of speed this engine is sucking in as much air in a minute as I breathe in four days
getting close to the maximum which means the tires would only last for about 15 minutes
but it's OK
because the fuel runs out in 12 minutes
this is a road car and I'm getting up to 404
405, come on!
come on， give me one more!
406!
come on， I need one more, one more!
I'm covering a football pitch every second
that I'm pretty confident that's as fast as I'm ever gonna go in a car.
increadible
that is ...
it's made my eyes water.
I am impressed, James
OK.
thing is though, OK.
you know when you take a Ferrari or a Lamborghini or particularly a Koenigzegg to its top speed...
no. - No, actually you wouldn't
but anyway, when you do
they fizz they buzz
they feels like all the body panels are peeling away because you're right on the edge of what's physically and technically possible.
Really? I didn't get any of that with this.
to be honest, the only thing I've got was at the end of the straight
I had to touch the breaks, so you see the spoiler come up slowing down.
you got a sort of ...
and that's it?
Yeah, just...
so it's kind of safe and relaxing even at 250 miles an hour
absolutely, yeah.
it's totally undramatic.
but I would give you a bit of warning which is a bit disorientating doing that sort of speed.
because, after I come off the banking
I was slowing down to stop
you know how you get a bit impatient, you think I'll just open the door
fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70
Umm.OK, so.
we've established that this is faster across Europe than - your light ari-craft - Yepp.
we've established that it realy will do 250 mph
but we've never been able to find out how fast it'll go round our track
now the problem is Bugatti are happy for us to have one here.
they are happy for you to go and do that.
but they won't lend the Stig one.
Umm.So really, this is an appeal.
if you've got a Veyron and you'd like to lend it to us.
we're prepared to pay anything up to 30 pounds
and now the news and we start off with the Porsche Cayenne because they've revised it and come out with a new one
it's got new prices, new bits and pieces, new engines,
but the most important thing of course about a Cayenne is that it's never been the best-looking car, is it?
no, not even slightly.
well, we can only assume that this new one still isn't exactly the best-looking car， because ，well, here is the official photograph that Porsche sent out for us.
I can hear the discussion of the photographer had actually with the director.
he said "Is the light good for you?" and he said "No, there is still is some."
Yes, exactly.
now, hey, you know that young Russian business kid who bought TVR a couple of years ago?
Yeah.
Yeah, we've got a picture of him here at a business meeting - Oh, yeah, there he is - There
did he close down the factory in Blackpool and make everyone redundant.
exactly, well, it turns out that all the TVR owners have decided that they're gonna throw a party for the workers who've all been made redundant.
the party dubbed fundable will include a buffet dinner,
how much do I don't want to go to that?
err, bar disco and live band.
wahl, a TVR band.
so they'll play presumably really loud really fast and then burst into flames.
here's some news, you know the hot Renault Clio, there was a really fast one
they've done a even hotter one, OK?
it's call the R27
it's got a lower stiffer chassis.
we've got a photograph of it here, OK?
now, these are the four Renault formula 1 racing drivers, OK, for this year.
now this chap, OK, the new one,
he really likes this car, he is very excited by it.
he is very, very excited...
he is very pleased to see it, isn't he?
really pleased.
what I love as well,
if you look around the other guys, who clearly spotted the problem.
well, you could hardly miss it, could you?
they're all very embarrassed. Don't look
well, you see this, Ok, I got this photograph from a French website.
the actually official photograph that was sent to it by Renault
let me show it to you.
look, there's he, go and stand behind the car now.
look how embarrassing he is. - But they are all racing drivers.
couldn't they've lent a crash helmet to hold it in the appropriate way？
it was his crash helmet that caused the problem in the first place.
leave it...
err, oh, now
news from the director of public prosecutions who I discovered in the paper this week he is called Can or something rather
not called Can.
can is the name of a man you borrow a step ladder from
Yeah.
not the director of public prosecutions.
can has announced that there is a whole raft of new motoring offences for which you can go to prison, OK?
one of them is, retuning your radio.
Oh, don't, it's stupid. - What?
seriously
but what if the Archers comes on?
I can't listen to an episode of the Archers in the car without losing my temper and having a crash deliberately to end it?
can has decided that we'll have to tolerate these things, because you're not allowed to retune a radio, you're also not allowed to put lipstick on.
again, what...
but get this one. You are not allowed now to be an undertaker.
what? I don't got it, an undertaker?
you an undertaker?
you're undertaker? You're going to prison.
can says if you "undertake" someone,
Oh, hang on.
well, it's... I've always had been a bit of beef about this.
because I reckon if you go pass someone on the inside,
there was room to do that, there was room for them to have got out of the way in the first place.
it's wrong!
they are the ones who should be prosecuted.
they can't find prisons to put pedophiles in.
but they're going to be putting him in it for being an undertaker.
it's ridiculous.
you know actually they can't find the pedophiles cause 300 have got missing.
I know where they are.
if you drive down the outside lane of the motorway now, not retune the radio at 50 miles an hour, OK?
you are immune from prosecution, OK?
so it's the ideal place to go if you're being looked for by the law.
so therefore anyone doing 50 in the outside lane of the motorway is a child molester.
wahl, that's amazing.
you use logic there. That's incredible.
argue with that.
Hey, now, can I just say, OK it's been a while since we sat here as a group as you know, so I thought it would be a good idea just to count through a few of the good cars and bad cars we've driven when we've been off air and I have to say, good cars for me, Lexus.
particularly, actually, the GS, the one in the middle
I'm with you.
the hybrid one, mate
no, no, this one, OK?
this looks like a normal car.
the great thing is, OK, its batteries will only take you less than a mile which means most of the time you are on the V6, you know, you chewing fuel, you warming the world, and everybody is happy, OK?
it's very quiet, it's very fast, it's very very comfortable.
and of course you can drive it to London, do U turns on Piccadilly all day long can't Livingston cop charge you a penny.
brilliant car there. - It is a hybrid.
it's a properly brilliant car there.
I'm gonna put like a little 9 volt battery in a Hummer.
it's a hybrid.
I was very impressed if I maybe buy the Suzuki Swift Sport.
I am. - No, it's...
this is the most underrated
it's not going over well mate, it's not going over well.
before you all chime in, it's a small car, but, you know I'm not a big fan of the new Mini
I've just... It's too big and lump and all the rest of it
that I think is the new Mini.
try it, you'll be amazed. It's brilliant that car.
that's an order from him.
actually, to be honest, I quite like that as well.
I, I... actually really did the Volvo C30.
I know, don't think I gone mad.
but it's a good looking car.
and you can get it with a 5 cylinder engine which is exactly the same one as in the Focus ST, the hot one.
worst cars, no question for me.
one of the top 5 worst cars I've ever driven. VW Golf GT.
there.
no, seriously, it's got a supercharged and turbocharged engine, which is as smooth as falling down stairs while wearing leg calipers.
basically if you tend to buy one of those, honestly, just work harder and buy the Golf GTI.
there is a Top Gear top tip. - good advice.
I was pretty disappointed, I hate I have to say this a Bentley Arnage T, not the R which is brilliant.
this is a useful consumer advice for people in the north.
well actually it is.
and I'm sorry it is.
because the T has a bit more power and a bit more torque and it's just enough to spoil it.
if you stick with the R, which is the beautiful car, they cost 12, 000 pounds less so you can buy a house.
for me, it was the Subaru Tribeca which is a MPV and technically it's not bad but it's hideous and it's a family car.
so my kids would too terrify to get in it.
hating it. it's not... it's just... it's hideous.
Hey, now, Jaguar have made a concept car.
well, not another one.
it's why they never make any money, isn't it?
because they just keep making concept cars all the time instead of just making cars that you can buy.
well I know, they haven't understood that if you sell a car, you get money.
Yeah.
anyway, this one, OK?
they say, which I've got a picture of it here.
OK? They say, that's going to be the next S type.
it will be looking exactly the same as that.
well, if that's true, that's fantastic news.
it looks brilliant.
I know. It does. I went to see it in the flesh the other day.
the designer was there and he said "I assure you, the S type will look exactly like that.
if that car comes out like that,
I'll cut my left leg off, beat myself to death with it.
Really? - Yeah.
do it.
make it, just make it.
now, if you're looking to spend between 20, 000 and 25, 000 pounds on a coupe, your choice just became a lot more complicated.
so, to see if we could help you out, the three of us have been to Scotland for a row.
these are of the cars that have caused the problem.
there is the new Audi TT, the new Alfa Romeo Brera, and the not so new, but still quite interesting Mazda RX-8
so, let's start with the Audi.
now I want to make it absolutely plain that
I did not like the old TT.
because all they did to make it was put a Golf in a pretty front.
that's like putting a cow in a track suit.
still not gonna win any running races.
with this new one though, they really have gone to towns.
it's longer, wider and more aggressive than the old model.
and even though this is the baby of the range, it's more technical as well.
take the body for example, from here back, it's steel, from here forwards, it's aluminum.
and that not only makes the car lighter, it's actually 9 stone less than the old TT, it also improves weight distribution.
then there is the suspension, the fluid in the shock absorber has got iron filings in it, then round the outside there is a magnet, turn the magnet on, your iron filings move about, everything becomes firmer.
and how much do you not want to go on a holiday with a man who thought of that.
the upshot is, this is no longer a cow in a track suit.
it's a cow GTI in racing overall.
the steering in the old car was numb, in this, it feels connected.
the ride in the old car was as comfortable as falling down a flight of stairs, in this, it's smooth when the iron filings are dormant and then when you push the switch to turn the magnets on it becomes racing car sharp.
this is not a car for taking your hair to the hair dresses any more, this is a car for making your hair stand on end it's a proper sports car.
rubbish!
what you want is one of these.
this is the new Alfa Romeo Brera.
it's a brilliant car.
on the face of it, the Alfa is exactly like the TT.
they are both four-seat coupes, they've both got four-cylinder engines, they've both got six-speed gearboxes, they both cost around 24, 000 pounds, and they'll both also be available with 3. 2 Liter V6 engines and four-wheel drive.
but actually, this is not like a TT at all.
now we've said this time and again on Top Gear
you can not consider yourself a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.
they're not cars for posers, they're cars for connoisseurs.
there're some times, they'll infuriate you other times, they're really gonna thrill and excite you, but the point is: they're never, ever boring.
it was not designed like the Audi, using just science and technology and iron filings,
it also has soul and passion.
this car has a heart.
but you know what really swings it for me?
it's the interior.
sitting in here feels like you're sitting in a Milanese's espresso bar.
sitting in the Audi feels like you're trapped in a Berlin post office.
OK, then, James, have you told the ladies and gentlemen how fast the Brera goes from 0-60
no, I haven't and I was rather hoping you wouldn't bring it up.
but never mind, ladies and gentlemen, it does it in 8. 1 seconds.
which in 1976 would have been considered pretty brisk.
James, you could be out dragged but a canoe boat.
it's not a slow car, it's just not quite as quick as your car.
which is a car for people who use moisturizing products.
James, I'm with you.
I prefer an Alfa to an Audi.
but not that Alfa Romeo, that's too slow and that's an end of it.
it's not too slow, it's plenty fast enough...
James, our colleague has arrived.
here he is
lord Woolworth is here.
if it's power you want, then this is your answer.
the wankel engined Mazda RX-8.
when it comes to speed, it will do 0-60 in 6. 4 seconds,
that's a bit faster than the Audi and a whole lot faster than the Alfa.
top speed is round 150.
put it on a track, and you quickly realize what this car is all about.
about this engine, it is different, it's a rotary.
so you use it differently.
all the power is at the top end.
so you can crush it mercilessly, an it will thank you for it.
there is something else too，The Alfa is basically just an Alfa saloon underneath,
and the Audi is just an Golf in a fancy front.
the RX-8, however, is bespoke.
it was designed from the ground up to be a preliminary sports car.
this is the only one with rear wheel drive.
it is a proper blue-blooded driver's car.
listen to that, 7, 8 , 9
and yet despite all that, it has four doors.
you see, you got your big door at the front, usual sort of thing, then you got the little door for back seat passengers.
look at that，It's brilliant.
there're a few disadvantages I admit.
you'll struggle to get more than 23 MPG, it uses quite a lot of oil, and the depreciation is a bit steep.
but then a RX-8 is 2, 000 pounds cheaper to buy than the others, and 2000 times better.
and I don't care what those other idiots say.
a tricky decision then, three similar cars, but three different opinions.
to see if we could find a winner, the three of us needed to meet up.
so this being Scotland, the home of golf.
we decided to break out the Pringle.
what will you be using here?
how the hell do I know?
I've never ever played golf.
and it's like that, isn't it?
I can't believe you.
you seem to look like somebody who've done it...
Hahaha...
you've got dressed up in that outfit to do that.
to be honest, I could've carried it that far.
that doesn't look right.
how could it not look right?
shut up, watch and learn.
Wow! - It's gone in the sea.
it's gone in the sea. - Yeah.
I will tell you what, Richard,
your Mazda would look good here.
get off, it is not a golfist's car.
it is actually. - That actually is.
I'm fairly confident you won't see an Alfa Romeo in the car park.
no, we won't.
but I'm afraid I could see your car as well.
TT? - Yeah.
TT is the car for the kind of man who matches his belt to the little tag on these trousers and he is then proud and pleased with that.
what do they do and got they could do this, don't they?
he's gonna do it again.
it's like his pre-fly checks - I'll kill him, I'm going to kill him.
that's quite...
well it wasn't bad.
well, it was.
I just got a hole in 21.
we were extremely quick at getting to a new hole.
Oh - Oh, no... - Hahaha
Oh, well done.
but every time we got there...
Yes! Hahaha ... things slowed down again.
are you using an ace?
partly because we were useless and partly because we kept arguing about our cars.
that Mazda is chintzy, it's nearly as chintzy as...
Chintzy? I'm sorry, I just...
both of your cars are pompous...
rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish...
OK ，how long you wanna me keep saying rubbish?
this annoyed the proper men of Pringle who were queuing up behind us.
there is no Roush leather in the Audi, there is no...
well, practically, it might as well be Roush.
there're people behind us, they're very angry...
I know there're people waiting on
I'm trying just to get on with it, yeah, I know.
Nope.
after an hour we reached the third hole and were still arguing.
you are completely wrong about the Mazda.
technically it may be good it may be fantastic on the track, but it's not what's it about on the road.
it's too jigly, - it's too harsh the interior, - Jigly?
just because the Alfa is slightly slower, - You think it must be able to... - It's not slightly slower, James.
it's a little bit slower in the real world but in terms of being of the way it feels to drive, the balance, the feel of the steering, the ride, the little niggles you get in... it hasn't got a
how far can I hit his head?
... fundament like yours have
that's just childish and doesn't solve the argument.
after this, we were asked to leave.
and all we've managed to agree on is that the Alfa was the least golf clubish.
thank you, thank you obviously we will pick that up later on.
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
please welcome to this poky motoring show, - How're you doing - Hi, good to see you. Very well.
have a seat. Uh... Have a seat.
and um... grateful you've come.
no, but it really is, because for the first time ever in the guest interview - we've got girls all around the front. - Ah... yes.
cause normally at this point they're all out side talking to Hammond, but now he's out there all by himself.
so let me start off with cars if I may.
big hollywood star obviously, so I presume you've got a Toyota Prius?
you would have thought, you would have thought, um... no,
I have... in my life I've had 2 modes of car, - Little tiny tossers' cars - Uh hum.
and great big [beep] cars.
um... - And you're in which mode now?
do you know, the first time I'm right in between the 2, the tossers' cars began with a...
a Citroen Dyane and I don't think you can get much tossier than that.
well the great thing about... No the great thing about the Dyane is you could crash it and nobody ever knew 'cause there were so many different angles on it that it was sort of always in...
Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, also it was... you couldn't hurt anyone because it had the power of 4 harnessed children and there is...
and then you got into the kind of - well you eloquently put it Wankers' cars - Yeah.
which started with?
well it started with, um, an Aston Martin Vanquish which was a beautiful car, you want to lick it or mate with it or something, but I never really wanted to drive it very much cause the gears did just occasionally, just when you were feeling happy in your car would just seize up, the car would stop, you couldn't even push it to the side of the road, you're just there on the A316 with people going past making wanker signs at you.
a lovely car.
yeah ,and then it was Bentley, wasn't it?
then I... yeah, I did have a Ben... I had a footballer's car,
bentley GT Continental, um, and very nice again, but I've got a bad back and for some reason it manifests itself some times as back pain and some times as bollock pain with the uh...
with the GT Continental, I got terrible bollock pain some cars seats do it my brother's Golf GTI was the first one hence the syndrome is now known as golf ball. Um...
and I got it very badly with the GT Continental so that had to go back after 6 months.
because of your testicles?
Yes, I didn't say that to the... um garage.
so um... then what... after the Bentley was?
then...
I had a beautiful Porsche which I actually phoned you about.
Yeah, well, actually your girlfriend phoned me up - Yes - And said listen - I've got to get Hugh a car - Yeah a Porsche... a Porsche, well that's wrong for a kick-off - but anyway she was adamant it was going to be a Porsche - Yeah
and then wanted to know whether it's going to be an automatic or manual gearbox?
Yeah. - So I said automatic.
Yeah, you're absolutely right and of course I got the manual, and it's so exhuasting...
cause you want... - All I wanted was a comfy environment
and a nice arm chair and for my balls not to hurt,
I got... it's not asking much for a car.
and the Porsche also has its interesting thing,
I think it's fine if the steering wheel's on "ze" left for "ze" Germans - I see, yeah - But on the right for the Brits, something's wrong I think the petrol tank's in the wrong place so you're facing forward like this with your upper body and your lower body is here sort of just looking dile... directly left, and I found that tricky.
that is tricky, I once had that in a Lancia Stratus but all... annoyingly in the Lancia Stratus all of you face this way while travelling in that... which it is really does make... it... the sensation of speed is tremendous
but you'd hit quite often.
now your driving, how's that?
do you have road rage?
terrible rage, yes, and uh...
well yeah, it's road rage that then becomes terrible road meekness in a flash...
in an instant... there was this guy who gave me the lightest of knocks, I mean barely touched the car and I went into a complete melt down, um... attacked him and when he wouldn't get out of his car, I thought
well I'll attack the car!
and I ripped the wind screen wipers right off his car, amazed at my own strength, and he said "You've ripped the wind screen wipers off my car"
and immediatelly I said "I'm so sorry."
"maybe if I... " I tried to put them back on, I said "I'll drive you to a garage"
pathetic... if you're gonna be angry you know, follow it through.
I once told... um someone who is staying...who had a dog in the hotel next to um... where I was staying that kept barking 5 o'clock in the morning,
I got up and then hadn't planned, this is always the play, if you don't plan what you're going to say - all goes wrong - Yeah.
I got out not sure quite what I was going to say, so I went "I've killed before!"
my wife was going "What have you killed before?" Anyway, that's...
let's talk about films, if we may.
your new film - Yeah.
OK, is you and Drew Barrymore - Yes, sir - And it's called?
it's called "Music and Lyrics" - "Music and Lyrics"
now, I'm sorry about this, we... we never normally do plugging on the show, - so I'm not very good at it. We'll try, - OK have you got any clips here? That doesn't work, does it?
we do have a clip, let me just explain what it is, um,
I play this ex-80s pop star, fallen on hard times,
I get this new contract to write a song for a very famous singer like it might be Britney Spears,
I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics until I come across this girl who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.
and we write this song together and then the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.
it sounds so good,
I can't believe it.
and now vocals no, no， you see, you have to sing into the microphone, it won't follow you.
but I can't.
it's... it's a duet for a man and a woman, we are as close as we've got, your head phones and a level, you look nice in those, you should wear them all the time,
how is... that? Yes?
OK. - Shh... Shh... Shh
it's ok
and...
"way Back Into Love," take one.
Oh, oh God, I'm getting really nervous.
you'll be fine, you'll...
just use your normal nice voice that I've heard so much of in the last 3 days.
it's like my throat's closing up, it's like anaphylactic
it's fine, just a 3 minute song "I've been living with the shadow overhead,"
I've been sleeping with the...
just uh... a little bit louder because this song is intended for humans ok?
very good.
do you think?
it's a romantic comedy, Jeremy, which is something I've never done before, so um
I'd like to stretch myself as an actor, it's all about discovery, isn't it? Reacting, trying new stuff.
and it's a um... I think a lovely funny film
its open's on um.on the 9th of February.
em... can I just talk... ok, you're... we're the same age, give or take, I think...
it's hard to believe to look at it, isn't it? - Yeah.
frankly it is, yeah.
are you starting to fall to pieces yet?
yes I am, yes I am , Jeremy. Yes. - Are you?
uh... worst bit for me, is when you're...
you've wash... you've shaved, you're rinsing your face like this, and then you look up into the mirror,
I've got a mirror to the side here.
my eyes look up but my face is still pointing down.
that's... - That's how.
and also didn't you have some trouble with your bottom?
that was a terrible moment, yeah, that was a really terrible... I... I...
funnily enough that was for "golf ball," it was.
I went to see a doctor in Harley Street, and I... it was suspicious of him to begin with because he said uh...Very good if you'd just like to sit, pull all your clothes off?
so I... I took them all off, and then he interviewed me. I sat...
I sat naked as a baby in front of him like this in a... in a very expensive big consultation room while he wrote down things about me, kept looking at me and writing all the things down.
and then he said "Right, we're just going to uh... do a quick uh... prostate examination."
bent me over, and I swear to God, stuck his head up my bottom, because when he said "Does that hurt?"
it was muffled, it was "Does that hurt?
and it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life.
OK listen, I really want to get onto your lap, obviously.
Yes. - How did it go out there?
I thought quite badly, um...
I like the Stig very much, he was very kind to me um... but uh... it's not easy, it's not easy Jeremy.
you don't think so. - No, I don't.
cause it's so counter-intuitive, you know? Just when you're thinking:
well now I'm going to die so I'll brake but he says "Flat down with the accelerator!"
and uh... and the other way around and um...
I... I know I'm gonna be bad.
who here would like to see Hugh's lap?
Yeah! - Let's play the tape, here it goes.
this is you and there you go.
what a car.
that's... - A very unattractive helmet.
Oh, don't change gear, you [beep]!
crikey Moses! - That can not be my best...
that's quite grown up.
that was very good through there, excellent.
Oh where are you going now though? Yeah. - That's...
hammerhead - looking smooth and fast - I never mastered the Hammerhead - Is that a penalty? - That's good, no that's good.
good line through there.
Oh that was a piece of "art"
Oh [beep]
soon you're gonna cut inside and you won't be swearing.
is it gonna be fast through here?
see? Every time I came wobbling through a turn there was another ex-BBC camera man right in my way.
did exactly the wrong thing again.
and here we are, last corner - This is very poor - That's going wide that's wow yes! Across the line!
now
I um...
I know it's not good, I know, I feel... I feel like I've let anyone... everyone down - and including the Stig. - No, what do you mean? It's only yourself.
so where do you think you've come on the um...
on the board? - Ah, I wish I knew.
who would I really like... I wouldn't like to come lower than Michael Gambon.
michael Gambon? You've beat him. - Yeah.
Oh that's good. In that case, I... I quite like to beat you and McGregor.
well, you actually did it in 1 minute - Yes.
forty - Yes - Seven... Point seven - Yes - Oh hello. - Congratulations!
you're right up there.
you're in fact only emm.
point one of a second behind the well spoken man.
Yes, yes.
anyway, so there you are, uh...
ah sorry but Jamie Oliver was in the snow, so he moves up, is that right?
no he wasn't, it had melted, he did melted snow - He claims it was snow, and we punished him for that - Yes
so no, I... I think you're better and funnier and much better looking with a smaller tongue.
ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Grant!
right, now, earlier, we were testing three coupes to decide which one is best.
I really really like this Alfa Romeo Brera.
Clarkson stupidly prefers this new Audi TT and the damn fool Hammond seems to think it should be this Mazda RX-8.
and so far, we have established pretty much nothing.
but now in the second part of the film we drive into Edinburgh and still arguing.
can you set the sat nav in your car, OK?
err, no, I haven't got sat nav.
could you do that, Richard?
I go by instinct in here.
so it's the driver's car, or the navigator's car.
or the air hostess's in the case of yours Jeremy
think it with a bit of dust on my headlamps, so I will just wash that off.
Yes, I've done that with my headlamp washers.
have you done that, James?
well I did that earlier with a wet hanky and end of my finger.
but either of you two got a DSG gearbox.
no. - No.
have you got adjustable suspension, either of you?
no. - No.
but then I fired a torpedo straight into the side of HMS Clarkson.
Jeremy, can I just ask how much of that stuff is standard.
almost everything really is an optional extra.
how many is that lot cost?
err, the optional extras on this car add up 2000 pounds.
how much?
six thousand pounds.
six grand?
it's actually eight grand but shh...
it was tit for tat all the way and nobody was going to give in.
the truth of the matter is this the car you really want looks like the Alfa drives like the Mazda and is built like the Audi.
but since that doesn't exist you've got to have the Audi.
cause it's the best all round of the best compromise and that, that's an end of it.
it wasn't the end though, because coupes are all about looks.
and to find out which of ours was the best looking we've been told to go to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.
the challenge was simple, if this prestigious gallery was to accept just one of our cars based on styling and love, which would it be?
a panel of experts have been assembled to make the choice.
and to help things along, we'd each been given two minutes to argue the artistic merits of our particular car.
but before that, five minutes in the gallery bookshop to bone up our art bit.
is there anything Japanese at all?
scottish arts...
you have like a single volume on the artistic influence of Alfa Romeo coupes.
err, Japanese culture in general maybe like into an oyster.
opening itself up to repeat the onslaughts from the... oyster.
unfortunately the crash course in the bookshop just confused us even more.
as the experts discovered when James kicked things off.
em, good afternoon professors.
I'd like to begin by asking the question
can a car be a piece of art?
I'd like to say immediately that I think no.
that's not a piece of art but can we find any art in that piece of design?
I'll put it down there.
can I really argue that the Audi TT was a reaction to the overly complicated ceiling rose of Victorian houses?
for example we can see in the lights of the Alfa Romeo here
I think the influence of the Scottish colorists, namely Fergusson and Peploe
you went to art school, you should be good at this.
did you go to art school?
no, I didn't.
then you wouldn't know what you do in art school is drink and pursuing women.
all arts I believe should be about two things, truth and beauty.
now, it's true because it's real.
it's not actually a piece of art.
how do we shut this man up?
do you know what? We've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier,
I've raced you to Oslo
this is the hardest thing I've ever faced.
he's given the impression that he's taken his brush oil, even his calligraphy pen, the impression he has given...
I think we've probably heard enough,
that's alright with you, thank you very much.
I'll... I did want to talk about the renaissance and the meaning of truth - and the development of human thought - We could leave that for another day.
these trousers are not Bauhaus.
Hahaha
why we mates look a bit like a monkey?
their brains are big.
justify why you think your car should be in this gallery.
um, one can see influences of the Bauhaus thinking in so many of the things around us today, some of the design classic.
um Mart Stam's cantilever chair and the Marcel Breuer "Wassily" chair.
why is he talking about chairs?
it looks like it's going somewhere, it looks purposeful,
I mean if you compare it, for example, that's the inside of the Mazda, that's not Bauhaus.
that's my trousers...
woo, look, I found Jeremy's notes, trousers, fat, Hitler, tiger, Mazda, Alfa, modernism, minimalism ... minimalism, modernism
I think it created cubism, I think it created Picasso, no, not that one
cubism came about 10 or 15 year earlier, but go on...
I don't think that... I think the Audi is Bauhaus...
but I think it's got a very contemporary veneer.
I mean one shouldn't hang the whole item on the Bauhaus,
I don't think it's "Das ist einfach nicht wahr" as they would say in the Bauhaus
it's just not true.
what does it symbolize?
the Audi symbolizes freedom?
freedom! Like that.
warm in there, isn't it?
err, gentlemen,
God is the reason why you might look at this car the Mazda RX-8.
and see there's something a bit unusual.
the Mazda is a Japanese car.
in understanding a little bit about why this car is different to ours.
and you can see that express through out Japanese culture and paintings,
if you to take
we are just gonna see you put your hands in your pocket 'cause you're sort of refering to note here.
I can... I can do that.
em, if you refer to "Catching Catfish with a Gourd," from the 15th century by Josetsu
one of the blokes over there is an expert on Japanese and oriental art, you know that
can you just reiterate some of those points?
which point?
the ones you just made.
did you feel a bit thick when you finished doing it?
thick?
how do you think he is gonna feel?
he'll probably punch one of them...
I've eaten brighter vegetables than he is.
you put this car in the gallery...
yeah
what else are you going to have in the environment that surround it?
maybe to extend it further. Maybe to have some other Japanese stuff in there.
do you have any examples, that you think would be or value for the potential visitors?
some paint. Japanese paintings.
by anyone particular?
that would be for, perhaps, you know, specialists to choose.
how did that go?
I think well, I think well, err
do you know you're bright red.
Yeah, I'm hot, very hot.
the boffins conferred and then called us all in to give their verdicts.
I think the Audi is err you know sort of constrained, it's modest, it's sort of tidy.
but it's not saying, doesn't say very much to me.
you know, this lessness is less for me not more.
err, I'm most persuaded by the Alfa.
I agree entirely, yes.
the Mazda, I looked at it from various angles.
and it just doesn't seem to be as clear cut as an expression of what the modern art motif coupe is. And I think that's the Alfa.
in terms of the look, the style, everything that it denotes we'd be happy to show that car in this gallery, the Alfa Romeo.
well it's alright.
- Cause it'll just break down before it got here.
- You get oil all over your nice floor.
come on, you can stop being petty and infantile.
these three men are experts in art and artistic expression...
well, they are wrong. - It's only cause I've said freedom. That's what we...
well, rubbish.
as Richard said: They were wrong.
so now we're gonna do a much more important test which is the fastest around our track?
now obviously to find that out, we have to hand them over to our tame racing driver.
some say that he once had a vicious knife fight with Anthea Turner and that he is in no way implicated in the 'Cash for Honours' Scandal
all we know is, he's called Lord Stig.
well that has wasted about an hour with wheel spin.
get off, he started off in the best car.
the only proper sports car, of course the Mazda.
rear wheel drive of course, this is familiar to him, it feels like a sports car 'cause it was designed as a sports car.
radio: Lucy looked at him, the strong, kind face and the endearing look in his eyes, and she opened her heart to him.
now you see, this romantic fiction, he's into it now.
right over... oh look at that, you see, - it's so controllable, you can steer it with the rear end. - Is it moving? Is it moving?
rubbish, it's fast, mate.
don't ignore. Here we go , hammerhead.
Oh - Look at that.
no, no, that's miles off.
that is elegant and controlled.
that really is. He'll be enjoying that in there, - that's familiar territory for him. - 40?
and it looks at home on the track unlike the other two.
he'll have to lift off then.
it's not for... Oh, look at that. - 45
braking, oh he'll be around here in a minute. - Now he's got 1 corner and the final corner, - under control and looking like a proper fast car - Look at... chintzy styling - He's lost it, that's all... very bad. - Oh, what a spectacle.
still there,
no, good front end grip, good balance, excellent brakes,
Oh ho ho, did you see that dive?
wow, it's like watching the actual studio going around, isn't it?
that's balance and poise. - It's boring.
I suppose you're gonna tell us it's the most practical car, James?
well actually it is, you see.
because you can get 2 people in the front, 2 in the back and a set of golf bats in the boot,
I checked that.
Oh very useful.
and it goes off the road...
you know it's no good for golf cause it's the least Pringly and now you're telling this's got golf rackets in it.
look at that - It's... It's not turned at all there, it understeered...
look at this, really, I've never seen a car oversteer...
he's using all the track, - that's what... - He needs all the track, that's different.
it hasn't let... no, here we go, it'll just crash now, no, that was...
beautiful.
here we go, he's understeered...
well, no he's got it in... yes -Very neat, clip the apex.
and here - Steering accurately - Out of control
we got oil coming out of the bottom, right, gentlemen, behold the magnificent.
Oh you're off to the hair dresser, sir?
get off! - Hahaha.
Oh would you like any bred items?
I know you're thinking this is the old TT, don't muddle them up, that was for air hostesses, people who are orange.
this is the new one, it's a completely different animal, this remember it's only the front wheel drive one, the baby one, look at it.
front wheel drive, unlike a sports car, which would have rear wheel drive.
Oh you just saw the back coming round there, - it's got a little bit of left off over steer. - A little bit
I saw it, I saw the front nod.
here we go, just watch this, look at this, compare to your one James?
it's worse. - Boy, that was so slow!
it's not worse.
it is worse, look, it's on the grass, it's almost on the grass.
the... right... honestly, this is a completely different animal than the one we used to have.
this is fast. Yes. - No.
only the 2 Liter one, remember?
just the baby. - Miles out.
the V6 actually is nowhere near as good as this.
as we come up to the final corner.
it's going to under steer off and crash.
Oh, it's done it, it's off the road.
it's just airborne.
right, ready?
time for the Audi 1: 31. 4, check it out.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be so confident, because you see my car, I think on a race track, you'll find that...
Hahaha, five seconds.
listen, you can stop being quite so cocky about it because your Audi hasn't won anything yet.
remember how it's been? It's not the best looking, it's the most expensive.
it's not the most practical.
exactly and we're about to find out that it isn't the fastest either when my Mazda beats it.
Hah! Oh...
damn...
no, no, no you've won.
I've lost.
no 'cause I'm gonna own up now.
secretly all along I've preferred the Alfa.
what?
no, I just know, I... seriously, I just... if it were my money, that's what I'd buy, and I'll bet you any money it's the same for you.
Yeah.
Yes, I knew it, I knew it.
but, I'm sorry before you get too cocky,
I would not recommend one to a friend.
that's the thing, cause you... well you wouldn't, you can't say "Yes, go and buy an Alfa"
cause then they'll spend the rest of their life in a car that just stays on the side of the motorway.
so I can't recommend one to a friend. Could you?
no, I wouldn't recommend one, no.
e... E... would you? - Come on.
no, alright.
there you are, you see? You wouldn't.
so what we've managed to establish is the best car here is the worst!
Yeah, wow we're good at this.
we are.
and that's the end of the show, thank you very much for watching, next week we've got a top gear special see you then, good night.
in New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.
on that line live Danson and Highsmith.
tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.
get rid of that asshole.
Uh-oh! I hate it when you say "uh-oh"!
dude, you put a ding in my hood!
come on with it, then!
that's trouble.
did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?
that's it. I'm sick of all this running.
hang on!
you have the right to remain silent!
but I wanna hear you scream!
down on the ground!
detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!
one at a time, all right?
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,
new York Observer Online.
these suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana, a misdemeanor in some states.
do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?
why don't we let New York City answer that question?
the greatest city on Earth, yeah!
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?
no comment.
but, yes.
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!
no drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.
they're rock stars.
then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets and the other guys.
we know, we know. We know.
all right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!
we're having a celebration tonight at Butter.
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.
that little short bitch from Jersey Shore. Yeah!
and most of you are on the list.
you're the best.
guys, I'm gonna say something right now.
it's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.
arnold Schwarzenegger! Let me finish.
he became a champion and then a movie star, all right?
arnold Schwarzenegger! God damn it, let me...
they ruined the story. They ruined the story.
Let...what the point is, we couldn't do our job if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork, answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.
all the gun fights all the car chases all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to, all due to what you guys do. Thank you.
and we'd do it again and again.
Hey, you shut your face!
if we wanna hear you talk,
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!
you hear me? You hear me?
cash bar. Yeah.
peace out, bitches.
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.
come on. Bring it in a little bit.
all right, right there.
just back up, just like right there.
all right, just one...Just a...
there you go, right there. Right there.
this is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.
that's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.
it's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.
no offense, Bob. That's all right.
anyway, now who wants it? I do!
all right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!
nice work. Thanks, Allen. Thank you, Captain.
I'll do it! I'll do it!
stop humming that song!
I can hum if I want to. - No, I know you can.
I'm asking you to stop.
well, if you're asking, then I'll stop. - Thank you.
could you not smile like that?
now you're asking me to mask my emotions because of how it makes you feel.
that I will not do.
seriously, stop humming! Okay?
this isn't accounting or wherever the hell you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.
forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.
Yeah, whatever.
stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.
Hey, guys. Reminder.
the police union picnic's coming up this weekend.
my wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.
it's a bad time, Bob!
all right.
going to get a slice.
you know what I just did?
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives, and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back, but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.
wow, I actually appreciate that.
good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.
no. You don't have to. - No, I don't like you.
I think you're a fake cop.
the sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.
if we were in the wild, I would attack you.
even if you weren't in my food chain,
I would go out of my way to attack you.
if I were a lion, and you were a tuna,
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!
and then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.
okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?
lions don't like water.
if you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that'd make sense.
but you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?
you lose that battle.
you lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?
you've wandered into our school of tuna, and we now have a taste of lion.
we've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.
yeah? And said, "You know what"?
lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion.
we've developed a system to establish a beachhead and aggressively hunt you and your family.
and we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring. How you gonna do that?
we will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.
we will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.
it's not gonna be days at a time, but an hour, hour 45, no problem.
that will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.
did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?
Nope.
two minutes before the markets open,
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, ringing the opening bell.
with Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon, who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.
how much did we lose?
you may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.
$32 Million?
no, billion.
shit!
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.
bang, bang. Yeah.
then I raise up to take the leader out.
shit, I feel like I'm there now.
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.
he says, "Let's even the odds!
he tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.
game over, bitches.
all right. Yeah.
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.
like my cock was made out of concrete.
I know it's very tempting.
you want to impress your friends.
but this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?
this is firing your weapon in the line of duty.
officer Hoitz?
Oh, man.
come on! Here we go.
would you like to share?
no, I'd rather not.
officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now, and you haven't said a word.
this is a safe room, no judgment here.
jerkoff.
that's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.
I relive it every night.
bronx, October.
game 7 of the World Series.
for all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.
whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!
finally pulled my gun.
pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.
don't make me shoot! I'll do it!
are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?
you dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!
you cost me 20 grand on that game! Douche bag.
cost the city a championship.
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.
now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner.
everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.
because you shot Derek Jeter!
he's a biracial angel.
you should've shot A-Rod.
yo, Paper Bitch.
what's up, man? Hey. Hey, guys.
paper Bitch. Paper Bitch.
I don't like that, actually.
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.
still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?
shit. No, actually, actually, that's...
what is this? That looks stupid.
guys, it's illegal permitting for construction.
specifically, scaffolding.
some of the guys were talking.
they were like, " How come you've never fired your weapon in the office before"?
good point.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
you've never fired your weapon in the office.
we all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.
fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.
not true. I'm not stupid.
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.
gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.
we honor the flag, and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.
Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?
september '08.
be a man. Do it. Now.
please, please, do it. Pop one off!
there you go. Pop it off! Don't think, just go!
here we go. Do it, yes.
he did it!
Hey! Shots fired!
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!
it's a real thing, right?
a desk pop? Yeah.
no, that's not real!
they were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.
all right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.
Yes, sir.
captain, you really wanna disarm this guy, take out the batteries in the calculator.
all right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun.
I use it for ceremony.
there.
you get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.
listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.
and I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?
I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.
now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.
I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.
just think about...Just be smart.
they're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.
all right, we got it.
good luck, guys. Have a good one. Allen, let's go.
no, I got work to do. What? This is work!
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.
you cream puffs, sit tight.
you gotta be shitting me!
you can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!
did he just... did he just call himself a peacock?
let's go! Let's go!
come on, fellas!
wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!
that's the second one this week!
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!
let's go!
Yeah!
heads up!
shit.
special Forces zipline.
cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!
these guys are pros. Let's go!
you thinking what I'm thinking, partner?
aim for the bushes.
cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.
maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.
maybe their egos pushed them off.
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.
either way, there was a hole in New York City, and it needed to be filled.
two days ago, this city wept.
we lost two heroes who gave everything for us, who paid that ultimate sacrifice so that we may walk these streets safely.
there wasn't even an awning in their direction.
no, I know. They just jumped 20 stories.
doesn't make sense, does it?
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.
it's our moment, Allen.
our moment to step up and be the guys.
we're at a funeral. Show some respect. What?
you don't think every other detective here isn't thinking the same thing?
allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.
their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.
that someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.
is it? Yeah.
what about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens, all just stepping up and doing their part?
as a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.
I went to school and made my bed.
and at age 11, I audited my parents.
and believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.
what the hell are you?
well, well, well. What do we got here?
look at these two jamokes, would you?
one shot Jeter and the other shot an office.
have some decorum. We're at a funeral.
you wanna dance, brolio?
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks.
you'll be pissing blood out of your ass.
that's horrible.
why don't you step back, man?
you touch him, I swear to God
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.
he's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.
you wanna go? I wanna go!
get him off. Kick his ass, Martin.
Yeah. How do you like that?
pull his hair! I love it.
this hurts so good.
very sorry for your loss, ma'am. What a lovely hat.
I love your shoes.
it's fine, it's fine. Go, go.
punish him!
Oh, man.
do it. That's how we do it in the hood.
punish him. That's not even a move.
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.
what the hell is going on here?
two good men are dead, you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?
is that what's happening?
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
let me tell you something.
sorry for your loss, Lorraine. Very sorry.
sorry, Lorraine. Sorry, Lorraine.
Hi, I'm Jimmy.
too soon? Why'd you say that?
I'll tell you something about those guys.
they knew that to become a good cop, you had to solve cases. Okay?
okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.
okay? So just watch it.
next time, me, you, library.
not even close. Come on, guys. Guys, come on.
you are... I'm the winner!
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay?
I could've handled that myself.
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.
move.
9: 15, let's have a great day, everybody! Cut the shit!
good morning.
we've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.
there are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.
try to stay out of trouble, boys.
there's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?
no chance. Too busy.
all right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?
we're about to lock shit down.
that's right. You girls stay here and get your type on.
go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.
shut up!
allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.
no, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.
it's about the construction permits you were talking about.
the scaffolding violations? This is our thing, yeah.
so, what do you got?
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.
what are you doing?
let's go. We're going to that call.
what is this? Shut up.
we're going to the car, and we're going after this case.
you're not gonna shoot me. I won't?
no. I shot Jeter.
that was an accident. Was it?
now move. Okay.
Hey.
does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.
I'm being kidnapped.
really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?
so, then what happened? What do you think happened?
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, and I got in my car, and I got out of there.
talk about a wild weekend, right?
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.
what are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.
what the hell is this?
it's my car. It's a Prius.
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.
detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.
we'll just see who's there first.
you stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?
go, go, go!
you feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?
big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?
are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?
I got something to get you going.
let's go do some damage!
Nope.
what the hell is that?
lrb. Little River Band.
this music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.
you know what? We go with no music, okay?
fine. Say bye.
no, no, no, don't say bye...
you just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!
allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!
America!
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!
seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!
Terry, I'm coming in.
you're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!
dude! What...
that's a lot of cocaine.
did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?
Nope. No. No.
I've never actually put my foot all the way down to the ground with the accelerator like that.
it got me slightly aroused.
here we go.
way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.
prius, huh? Yep, yep.
good mileage?
outstanding. Yeah.
did this come with a dental dam?
no. Get it?
my Suburban shit one of these last night.
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.
we've had our fun, huh?
looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.
all right, everybody!
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.
at the crime scene, LOL.
good tweet, good tweet. Yeah, thanks.
america has always been defined by its excess.
the Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis and a Subaru station wagon.
and it's because of this excess that I have flourished.
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.
live for excess. It's the American way.
hello.
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.
sir David.
David. You're not returning my calls, so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.
G'day, mate. Hey.
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you, because I think you're going to take off.
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.
you have until then to give me my money.
I'm not reporting any losses, David.
I have zeroed in on a new investor.
well, then, you get their money, make it disappear, and then pay us back.
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.
David! Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.
heard everything, mate.
ladies and gentlemen, guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.
that man there.
go! Go!
side! Step aside, please.
you don't think I'm a real cop, do you?
no, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.
I was really honest about that.
I'm working on a huge case, all right?
property owner with seven buildings under construction.
he hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.
now, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.
that's your big case? Scaffolding permits? Yeah.
guess what? You're coming with me.
it's a wooden gun.
that hurts, man!
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here.
I've got six disks in here.
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.
I'm flying Air Singapore.
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife? She died.
Attaboy!
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.
another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.
you're just mad because I have a nice change purse.
why do you even care?
how can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?
the way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.
you're being ridiculous.
they sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.
what? Like a little...
you know what bugs me about you? What?
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.
no, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.
you're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.
get out of the way, man!
wait. Are you David Ershon?
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...
anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.
excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay? What?
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used
what's the next part? As a floatation device.
as a floatation device.
you know what? That's very funny. I have never Mirandaed anyone before.
Really? Are you guys for real?
am I being punk'd?
detective Allen Gamble.
we are in a cocaine-covered car, and we are bringing in a perp.
one David Ershon. 175 pounds.
thank you. 175 pounds. Shut up, man, shut up!
martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B talking to Shepard Smith right now.
we arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?
wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?
for scaffolding permit violation...
I got my insurance card. Somewhere. Easy, mate.
what the hell? You ran right into us! Stand over there.
wood?
what the...
couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate. What?
do not let these men take me.
Hi.
Why's she looking at you like that?
that's my car!
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!
Hey! Excuse me!
why did they take our shoes?
what the hell just happened? Where's my iPhone?
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.
I don't get why we can't just call the office and have a squad car come pick us up.
no. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.
look, if we're gonna do this together, there's some issues we need to settle, okay?
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.
how do you think that makes me feel?
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.
I hear you.
let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.
all right. Fresh start.
maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers, 'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.
right?
let's do another fresh start, 'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.
fine, fresh start.
it's the last one.
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.
okay, folks! Everybody, listen up! Listen up!
got a high profile kidnapping.
david Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.
maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.
who cares? It's not important, okay?
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.
Bye, guys. Bye-bye.
come on.
guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!
that's the guy who took our guns, Captain.
and my shoes! Wait a minute, wait a minute.
did you identify yourselves as police officers?
what is this?
allen, tell me. Did you? No, we did not.
sorry, gentlemen.
we thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.
it's only protocol.
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.
the case is closed.
I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.
and you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.
thank you, Captain. You bet.
Australian?
special Forces, right?
best watch your step, Detective.
there are three things I love in this world.
kylie Minogue, small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...
beautiful features.
and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.
come on, man.
all right, look, they returned your shoes.
and they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.
allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it, some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.
you might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.
okay.
you're mad at us, huh, Gene?
first off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.
guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?
sure. All right.
well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?
the opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.
it's just "Captain."
just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.
that sounds creepy, "Captain Gene."
police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.
was he the victim of financial profiling?
financial profiling? That's crazy.
he broke the law and we arrested him.
that wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me."
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.
what about donkeys or deer?
they have hooves. What about bovine creatures?
were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?
Yeah. Yeah. I could see it.
listen, why don't we just go over to my place?
we'll talk the case down.
we can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.
two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?
it's not dinner. Fine.
and let me apologize in advance, okay, in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.
she's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.
okay, so I put together a little bio, complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.
david Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.
who's that talking?
it's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.
his largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.
Yeah, oil, media, health care, you've probably heard their jingle.
Lendl Global, we're in everything
david Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...
Yeah. And the lead singer of Maroon 5.
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels, black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.
how do you get that from anything I just said?
Hey, guys! Soup's on.
what do you mean?
Hi.
Hi. You must be Terry.
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.
who are you? I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.
come on, seriously. Who is that? His old lady.
sweetie, it's a workstation. Got it.
and you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.
come on, seriously. - Come on, what?
who is that?
get over here.
not... not right now.- Okay.
look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?
come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?
are you really Allen's wife? I know.
people are shocked because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic, but somehow it works.
are you gonna change? - I already did.
it's no big deal. You look really, really nice.
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.
don't speak to her like that, Allen.
look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, you'd probably get a D-.
allen and his apps. He loves them.
you know he's designed three of his own? One of them... can I tell him?
one of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face, and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.
Faceback. - Faceback.
got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.
it's gonna hit. It's gonna catch.
why are you with Allen?
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?
it's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.
you're gonna be bored by it.
I was a dancer for the Knicks while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.
allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.
Yes.
needless to say, I fell for him immediately.
we immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn, and, to be honest, we didn't speak. Three days of not communicating once verbally.
we had actually, without knowing it, developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.
you know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.
after those three days of non-verbal communication and a whole lot of loving,
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.
similar to operating on a German shepherd when they have hip dysplasia. Very painful.
it's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie, always forget the name of it.
with Meg Ryan. - Yes.
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.
I'll think of it. I'll think of it. - Okay.
so, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?
I did, yeah.
we were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.
Terry shot Derek Jeter.
shut up, Allen. This was before.
that's okay.
she's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.
that's it! Honey!
with Tom Hanks? - Right.
and Meg Ryan. - Meg Ryan.
he didn't have poison ivy up his ass.
Yes, he did. - Yes, he did. Yeah.
way up there.
well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...
what a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.
it was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.
it was my pleasure. Thank you.
and remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.
she tells me that every day before I leave. - Yep, I do.
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries, and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today, "you just don't get hurt.
Yeah. Every morning.
and then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you "when you get back home. " - Right.
you know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen, but, man, are they perky. - Not by a long shot.
and they are firm, and they are yours. - You're a nice lady.
thank you for coming.
detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.
go for Hoitz.
we found your red Prius. - Great.
it was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.
come on. Okay, sugar balls, listen up.
there's gonna be fingerprints on that car.
tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.
and if we get a hit, this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.
you do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.
okay.- Thank you, Sheila.
he'll bring it.
good night! - Good night.
thank you, Sheila.
Bye, Terry!- Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.
Bye, Terry!- All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.
Bye, Sheila!
night! - See you...See you, Terry!
Bye, Sheila.
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!
Bye, Sheila!
well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.
you find anything?
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.
from bodily fluid and hair samples, we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.
Oh, God. - Yeah.
you know what that's called when they do that in there?
that's called a soup kitchen.
it's pretty rough stuff.
not long after that, a mama raccoon came along and gave birth on the floor.
placenta blew out all over the back window there.
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.
I think he knew you guys were cops, because this is what I would call a spite shit.
you were able to determine all of that from the hair and fluid samples? - Oh, yeah.
what about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?
Nope, couldn't get a one. - Found a cell phone.
Yeah, that's mine.
any signs of a struggle or spent shells?
no. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.
in fact, they even left you a note here.
thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys.
here's something we found.
we found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.
no fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.
I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.
it's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.
found a deer vagina.
what? - Thought it was human lips at first.
then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.
not even a free ticket.
what are we gonna do?
we got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.
look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.
they used your phone? - They ghost dialed.
someone probably sat on it.
it could have recorded some of their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.
we gotta hear the other side of that call.
Nope, no, it's nothing.
nothing? - It's nothing.
it's the only lead we have. - It's nothing.
why did you just get super jumpy?
what?
it's an ex-girlfriend, okay?
what's the matter? What happened with you guys?
allen, it's the only lead we have.
we either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.
fine. Let's go see her.
Hello, Christinith.
Hello, Allen.
that's my partner, Terry. - Hi, Telly.
holy shit. Dude. - Just relax, relax.
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.
that was 13 years ago.
arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.
who wants some Arnie Palmies?
sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.
Hal, just place it down, please. - All righty.
okay.
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.
no.
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.
Oh, no, he knows all of this.
you're a lucky dog. - It's true.
Christine, this is a lovely house.
it's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?
Christinith, you idiot!
you come to our house, you get my wife's name right!
what? - Christinith!
look, we really appreciate the hospitality.
we'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.
we believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.
okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it and everyone else stay here.
okay, sweetie. - Come on.
there's my phone. - Great, thank you for...
I hate you, you son of a bitch!
you're so strong. - I'm stronger than you will ever know!
I hate you! I hate you!
you're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.
you go, "I love you. " Say it. "I love you, Cwistinith."
you probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.
but I'm not.
shaved.
Allen! - He's fine.
question.
what would you rather be, a bear or a dog?
I don't care. - I wanna be a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.
cause that way, I could live in the house but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.
Allen!
Allen! Allen!
this is police evidence. Terry! Let's go! - Hey!
you get back here and you make love to my wife!
Allen! Allen!
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.
your wife is crazy hot.
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, she threw you a "Do me" vibe.
what is it with you and hot ladies?
first off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.
dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.
you wanna listen to this message or not? - Yeah, whatever.
you have one job, mate.
find a sucker to invest with you so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.
and I don't care who.
right. I actually think I found a sucker...
he's talking to Ershon... to invest $32 billion.
who's got $32 billion to rob?
once I get the money, I'll falsify the records to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.
now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue, and after that...
I told you it wasn't a security team.
he was being abducted. - Obviously, but what kind... holy...
nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!
is that him? - Yeah!
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!
holy shit! - They chased us 20 miles.
you come back here! You get back here! - Allen!
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.
holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.
$32 billion. That's the state's money.
well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.
we have a scratchy cell phone message and an address.
it's still half a case.
there's gotta be some sort of paper trail.
if we can find that, if we can track it, then we can go to Mauch.
so, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm, and I found some pretty interesting stuff.
hold on, I'm up.
I gave my love to Erin
she promised to be true
I went to war to come back
and find five British soldiers had their way with her
it was consensual
done?
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey has only one client, David Ershon.
pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.
looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.
that's a shitty day.
and all their fathers were hanged
and the children all got pink eye while their Harry Potter books were burned
do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.
I do. They're full of rich history.
damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.
I thought you said you guys split up.
let's just keep our thing about work, okay?
all right. Goodbye, buddy.
Hey, get off me, man.
what the hell are you doing?
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?
I love you, Francine.
if you were with me, you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!
this is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.
he loves you very much, Francine.
who is this guy? - What are you doing here, Allen?
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.
Francine, is this guy bothering you?
who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.
he is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?
I know that this is a big surprise, but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?
now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.
what, you don't think I can do this shit?
that was surprisingly good, Terry.
I love you, Francine. - You don't know what love is.
he loves you very much, Francine!
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.
you know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.
and don't eyeball me, man!
you're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?
Terry!
he does not approve of your behavior!
can you please go?
and you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?
let's go, Allen.
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.
the ballet of emotion and feelings.
you're kind of making things worse.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.
we used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids, show them how queer they were, okay?
you learned to dance like that sarcastically? - Yeah, I guess.
stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.
stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.
all right, Terry.
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.
here, check this out. Article from six months ago.
talking about how the lottery is looking to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.
so he's dealing drugs?
no, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.
look, I'm sorry. I just...
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.
what happened?
she was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?
called "The Art of Oral Sex"?
you know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.
it's always about her.
Yeah, that's... that's messed up.
Hey, I got you a gift.
I just saw something, and I thought of you, and so, I don't want it to be weird.
I just wanted to be nice.
of course it's weird.
it's a grown man giving another man a present.
there you go. Open it up.
it's okay, you're welcome.
I like to do things like that.
take a look what it says.
female Body Inspector.
you know, because we're both in law enforcement.
we both like women.
but I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.
me, too.
real nice. You know, it's all class.
okay. - Don't do that shit any more.
Yeah, believe me, I won't.
do you understand what's so funny about it, though?
cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.
and at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI.
but then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?
get out of town. This is outrageous...
shut up!
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours one of these days, and it's gonna be glorious.
shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?
for what? We're just going to check it out.
I know, but it's procedure.
Terry answers to no one.
I do what I do.
what accounting firm is closed at 11: 00 a.m. on a Tuesday?
this is a shithole.
I love bombs.
I can't hear! I can't hear!
there's blood blisters on my hands!
Oh, my God!
how do they walk away in movies without flinching when it explodes behind them?
there's no way! I call bullshit on that!
when they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star, and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!
don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!
I need an MRI.
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.
there's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.
please stop.
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!
fire Department said it was a gas leak, but no way. That was timed.
they didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?
I'm tired of this. All right?
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.
I wanna go back to my desk.
guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.
you can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.
you know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?
there's no explosions at my desk.
there's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.
what are you afraid of, man?
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?
I was a sophomore in college.
the university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.
a classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort to raise money and stay in school, came up with a nifty plan where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.
I go on dates all the time, with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.
and I kind of need somebody to help me out, like, you know, my partner in crime.
Yeah, I could make a schedule.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
provide transportation services. - Yeah, yeah.
it's gonna be a good time. - Thanks so much for asking me.
she said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.
Oh, my God. You were a pimp. - What? God, no.
no, I was just trying to help a friend.
we started making a lot of money.
and wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends decided they wanted to be a part of it.
pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting while they gave me money.
that's called a stable of whores.
we decided I shouldn't use my real name.
so we came up with the name "Gator.
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.
No! Are you even listening to the story?
anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror, and I don't like what I see.
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.
you can't have a conscience in the pimp game.
one night, two of my favorite girls,
candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.
that's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.
I made a promise to myself and to her that I would never get out of control again.
so, as soon as I graduated from college,
I became an accountant for the police department.
the most stable job I could think of.
an accountant for law and order.
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.
don't worry. I got your back.
now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around. - Okay.
you can either walk the plank or take your panties off.
the choice is yours.
I want to take my panties off.
you've made a wise choice, you have.
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.
gentlemen, please.
remember us, hotshot? - Of course I do. Please sit.
there she blows.
two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.
guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.
Yes, that awful gas leak.
gas leak?
the only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.
I absolutely abhor death.
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?
we know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.
and we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.
you talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.
God, this water is good. Terry, have you tried the water? - Shut up, Allen
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up with the whole scaffolding business.
the cucumber accents the water in such a way that...
perhaps by way of apology,
I can offer you my personal courtside seats for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.
come on, Knicks! Come on!
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.
it is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.
come on call me
excuse me. - That was a trick.
no more
gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.
fantastic! You're so unbelievable!
damn it. He did it again.
excuse me. - No more tickets.
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.
that's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.
no, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.
no, I was very much looking forward to having a water.
how great is Jersey Boys? - It's not great. It's fantastic!
you totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.
wow, what a musical.
Hey. Get over here.
what's wrong with you? - What?
that's not what we're here for.
we're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?
it's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.
I come strong, then you come in.
you got it? - Yeah.
I come strong, then you come in. - Right. Got it.
now you listen to me, you piece of shit.
it's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!
how did you cover your losses up?
what drug cartel are you working with now?
okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable! - No, no, look at me!
you wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?
allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!
get away from me!
where is he?
look, I'm really sorry about that.
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought, "Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that," since we're doing bad cop, bad cop.
what? No, I said, "Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.
okay, then there it is.
that's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop."
well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.
think it's his phone sheet. - Nice.
seven calls to the lottery office.
that could be the evidence we need for Mauch.
get back. Colombian drug lords. - Where are you getting that from?
Jeesus
can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?
we call this in, right?
looks like we got all the evidence we need.
I'm sorry, my butterfly.
we'll load them up, send them back to go.
holy shit. - What?
what do you mean, what? Where are we?
we're in the high desert.
they took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?
they took your wooden gun? - Yeah.
Hello? - Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.
captain, it's Allen Gamble.
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?
captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
we are in Las Vegas, all right?
we were kidnapped, put on a freight train, and shipped out here.
let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.
captain, I am being straight with you.
look, we think something's going on, okay?
we think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.
wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?
Terry, Captain wants to know how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.
twice.
twice. Terry says twice. I agree.
I'm hanging up. I'm done.
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.
martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...
so, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.
solved the Castien case.
$74, 000? That's all they took?
there's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.
how about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?
all right? Just shut it.
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.
I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?
captain? - Yeah.
is it a bad time? - No, come on. Come on.
not me, right? - Yeah, and you.
fellows, I'm sure you're familiar with the venerable DA Radford.
he wanted to come down and pay us a visit.
Hello, gentlemen.
Hello, sir. - Hey.
you know, I was talking to Gene here. - He prefers "Captain."
Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.
I don't know what you two have been up to, but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.
in 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.
when that happens, stop.
gene, how's the family? Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.
my son's bisexual, so... - Tremendous.
gentlemen, do we understand each other?
cut the crap! - Will do.
guy never comes down here.
twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.
he's a heavyweight cat, that guy. - He was sitting right here.
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look.
blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River.
here you go, Terry.
you know what?
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.
to give me back my real gun? - No.
cause I'm gonna give you this.
it's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.
we were abducted, Captain! This shit is real!
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!
next, I want you guys to hand in all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.
the financial district's under their jurisdiction.
don't you get it? This case is talking to us!
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!
you know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.
they fly, they fly a little bit. - Yeah, about as much as a penguin.
one more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.
was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?
I don't even understand the reference.
you don't understand what you said? - I don't know what that is.
get out. - Go.
how did they get that story?
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.
Hey, guys.
there's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up, so if you just wanna come by the old... Damn it, Bob!
let me ask you something.
what do you even do around here besides interrupt people?
well, I serve as treasurer to the union.
I make a wicked pot of decaf.
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!
probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.
I'm gonna go for a walk.
Bob! - Say something.
come on! Bob!
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.
actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.
this coffee table? - Yes. We don't put drinks on it.
five hundred thousand? - He can read! Congratulations.
what? - I'm sorry, are you in the right place?
or not? I'm...
Terry. - Does he... Okay.
well... - Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?
I want to be with you. - No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.
you know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.
instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.
the chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.
you think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?
this coffee table isn't the ego.
it represents our shattered sense of community in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.
looks like the work of Cindy Sherman or Frank Stella.
how did you know that, Terry?
I took some classes at RISD so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.
Terry, lower your voice! - I don't have to lower my voice.
is this man bothering you?
are you actually having sex with this creep?
Terry, he's gay. Okay?
he's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!
all right? And also, he is my boss.
happy for you, man. Good.
can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.
nice toot, sailor. - Jesus.
Terry, what are you doing?
look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?
just give me one more year.
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.
fine.
Terry, don't touch that! Terry! - Oh, my God!
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!
and when you call me, I'm not coming back!
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!
fresh! Energetic! - I love his rawness!
stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!
Yes, you are. - Bravo!
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!
Yes! Yes!
these braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.
sweetie. - You know what, I'm sitting here thinking, "Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole "and serve it to their husband?
you would. You are being awful. What's wrong?
captain took us off the case. - I'm sorry.
I told Terry about my dark days in college, and it brought up some feelings.
well, honeydick, that was a long time ago.
you're not that same person you were.
no, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.
it wants to get out. It wants to walk around.
it wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.
and it wants to walk up with the people and say, "Hey, Gator don't play no shit."
you feel me? - Yeah.
gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.
sweetie, I'm sorry. - It's okay.
I just... - Remember that night we met?
the attending physician told me, "We got a drugged-out pimp in the back."
and I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,
you were weak, scared, ass up, inflamed, crying.
at that moment, I knew.
Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry.
pimps don't cry
pimps don't cry
no, they do not
they don't shed a tear
pimps don't cry
they never shed a tear
come lay with me.
be safe, and let's make love. Come on.
every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.
you gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.
allen, I'm pregnant.
whose baby is that?
who's the man who did that to you?
gator's bitches better be using jimmies!
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God.
you need to leave.
get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!
hey
Hey. What are you doing here?
come here when I have lady troubles, which means I come here about every night.
what are you doing here?
Sheila and I got into it tonight.
she threw me out.
well, you're not a cop till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.
does it bother you that the Castien robbers only took 74 grand in diamonds?
they're junkies. Who cares? I mean...
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.
how are you going?
we're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here if you wanna join us.
you're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?
here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos with fingers in each other's pooper in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.
it's gonna be a nice evening.
well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.
let me rephrase it.
we got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle, and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?
how do you know who we are? - You left a note in that car.
police, shithead. - He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!
rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!
you turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!
we are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.
fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.
no, I already have a beer. - No, no, no, no.
I'm talking about doing some serious drinking.
drinking with Terry Hoitz.
this sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case, now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?
Yeah, it's not right.
Oh, my God, I'm hungover.
so, you guys are law enforcement?
Yeah, we're an independent government agency who, along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve, regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.
and the Federal Reserve is a prison?
no, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates and loans money to other banks.
is that a wastebasket? - Yeah, right there.
thank you.
you all right? - Holy hell!
I'm so sorry.
I got so drunk last night.
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.
come on in, fellas.
you gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.
we're turning over our investigation to you?
let me assure you there will be no conflict of interest between me and David Ershon.
and if this were an actual investigation,
I would immediately recuse myself.
this is all the evidence we have, and I truly hope you take this seriously.
Yes. Very much so.
from everything I've heard, I understand you guys are the best at these types of investigations.
outside of Enron and AIG and Bernie Madoff,
worldcom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.
okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.
would you like a seat, or you're fine? - No, I'm good.
okay. Let me just assure you fellas,
david Ershon is an upstanding citizen.
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club, and we're having dinner.
you listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey, you play squash with Ershon, right?
your kids go to school with his?
how would you know if he's clean or not?
I will take a look at your evidence, and I will take a second look at the financials.
and when I come back and bust your ass, we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!
he still doesn't understand the concept.
what are you doing?
we just handed all of our evidence over to the bad guy's lawyer!
are you a big man, huh?
I'm talking to you. - What?
you wake up in the morning, you say, "I'm putting on my big boy pants"?
look, I'm wearing a belt!
"I've got big boy pants on!" - No!
you borrow a little jacket, you go?
you take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?
you got your big boy pants and your snack?
I could say big, loud things!
I could be demonstrative!
stop! We don't, we don't do this!
you're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!
is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?
what the hell are you doing, man?
I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.
it's exhausting.
I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.
you wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?
cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.
we've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.
all units, fire department.
sec. Beaman's office.
we have to go.
but the Captain. - We have to go, Allen.
all units, I need a respondent.
possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.
shit. It's Beaman!
he's gotta know something. Wesley!
detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.
I got no bullhorn. Does anyone have a bullhorn?
bullhorn, anyone? - Truck.
police business. I need to use your PA system.
okay, let me turn it on.
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?
it's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...
look, there's a lot to live for in this life.
a lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.
they do not care!
give me this. I know how to talk to him.
listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.
rotten piece of shit.
that's worse than what I was saying.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.
people down here are starting to murmur that you don't have the balls to do it.
I don't care! - Yeah.
I say you can do it.
I mean, I don't want you to jump.
I'm just saying you have the capability.
look, he's flying!
stop that.
half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.
look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.
make sure you get this, all right?
detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.
what about Ershon targeting the lottery?
you know why Ershon was calling down to the lottery offices all those times?
because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl, the one on TV with all the numbered balls.
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.
it was right there in front of you the whole time.
can't be. You guys are getting transferred.
what? Traffic.
Yeah, that's right.
you, you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
you're gonna walk a beat downtown.
it's done. No. Captain, what are you talking about?
no, no. It's done.
save yourselves some gas. Captain!
is there an appeal process we can...
had to do what you had to do, Captain.
Wow! That hurt.
excuse me. Where's my car? - They towed it.
couple of homeless people were messing around in it.
that's an official police car. Could have fooled me.
wow, Mauch was upset, huh?
Really?
the only thing I had to be proud of in my life was being a detective.
that was all I had. Now it's gone.
I know. I know. You still got me.
don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.
it's a real case, and I'm a real cop.
we just got the wrong target for Ershon.
you carry a rape whistle. - This is real cop work.
there is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?
you got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.
leave me alone.
a mutt case.
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?
a broken partnership.
I'm a cop!
and getting busted down to a shitty assignment.
allen and Terry hit the trifecta.
but sometimes when you get your ass kicked, that's when you find out what's real and what needs doing.
whether it's directing traffic...
come on!
or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.
do you work here? - Yeah, I do.
the wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.
they also did damage to your office?
some police officers came by and sealed it off.
do you recall what they looked like?
one of them had an Australian accent.
you don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?
no. Our main client is Lendl Global.
can I ask what this is about?
traffic ENFORCER OF THE MONTH
Terry Hoitz
gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!
cause that's what a real cop is.
no, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her upz."
a guy who does what needs to be done.
a guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.
and then you move to Florida.
one, two, three, attack!
Terry, it's me.
tap out. Tap out. - It's me, Allen.
are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?
I'm tapping out!
you crazy? What are you doing, man?
they might be watching us. - Could've killed you.
turn out the lights. - What?
they could be watching us. - Who?
I found some big information, okay?
about what? - Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.
how'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.
we can't be too careful. - What are you talking about?
this place might be bugged. - There's no bugs in here.
first off, I missed you.
what's going on? - Did you hear what I said?
fine, I kind of missed you, too. - Thank you.
okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.
it's Lendl Global. - What?
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.
they then altered all the records to cover the losses that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.
you're not supposed to be doing this.
you're supposed to be walking the beat.
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?
this is bad, Allen. This is bad.
no wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.
that's why they killed him. - Man.
here's the other thing.
tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.
Ershon's leading it.
I still can't figure out who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with, but we gotta stop it.
it's time to let the peacock fly.
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.
so do I. We're cops.
no. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.
what?
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.
what is this traffic bullshit?
what are you talking about? - I'm talking about my life.
the corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.
it's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.
there's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.
you've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.
what happened to you? What happened to this being our time?
no way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.
get in the car. - Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.
apartment pop. Now get in the car. - You're not gonna shoot me.
okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.
so stop pointing it at me.
look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?
for what? He doesn't care.
he's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.
turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.
I hope I'm not alone.
hope you bring it.
we got a big day out there. Big one.
we got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?
let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?
the new bathmats are in.
one more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.
jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.
well, don't ignore it.
if you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.
the oak.
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?
and these chopping boards?
Hey, Captain.
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?
what are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?
I need you to be straight with me. - Straight with us.
Hey, Terry. Look at this.
I thought you were working traffic today. - Let them block the box.
besides, partners' code, right? - Thanks.
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?
all right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.
you really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups, and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?
you keep hiding from shit in the world, and eventually the world comes to your front door.
nice. That's very nice.
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.
you keep this thing real quiet, and you make sure you have real evidence, and maybe I'll see what I can do.
but if you make a lot of noise and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,
I am out, okay?
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.
but there's one case, one case in a career where you go all in. This is it.
all right. Then you do us proud.
cause I don't want no scrubs.
Really? - No.
you're not aware that's a TLC song?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
second time. You said chasing waterfalls, now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.
I don't even understand the reference. - It's like a tic.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.
you can trust us. - Real quiet.
you gotta creep. Creep.
come on.
you don't say "Creep-creep" unless you're quoting TLC.
Hey, guys.
you know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?
not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.
you ready?
yeah.- Let's go.
no, but the highlights are great. - Thank you.
sexy but serious. - Thank you.
excuse me.
who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.
you know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.
who are they?
well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.
and the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.
you owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?
Yes. Yes, I do.
you're a piece of work. - Thank you.
probably best to get started.
this is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.
the only thing that bugs me is we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.
is it the lotto? Who is it?
who cares? Some rich prick.
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.
and I can assure you that every dime of your money will be invested with the utmost diligence.
your rates of return are really exciting.
we think our members are gonna be just thrilled.
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.
all right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.
beautiful.
all right, listen up.
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.
we need your cooperation.
david Ershon.
you're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement, and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.
this is a bad idea.
Hey, guys.
Bob? What are you doing here?
I'm investing.
do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?
this is what it was for. - Holy shit.
it's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.
gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.
we are within our rights to take action.
so much for quiet as church mice!
go!
who the hell are those guys?
gentlemen,
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.
even I admit that's not very tempting, but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!
get in the front! - How do you start this freaking thing?
go on! Go!
shit! Go!
Oh, my...
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!
hold the wheel!
open the back! - I got it. I got it!
they're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.
well, I'm gonna kill you first! - And then they will kill me.
we have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous, and holding David Ershon hostage. - Stupid pricks!
it's us, we're good guys! - Exactly. They're the good guys.
where do we go? Where do we go?
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.
not at the same time. That would be wrong.
let's hear it from the top, every detail.
I think the best way to tell the story is by starting at the end, briefly, then going back to the beginning, and then periodically returning to the end, maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.
just to give it a bit of dynamism, otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.
just tell us what happened.
I lost a bunch of money from some people and now they want it back.
what about Don Beaman?
beaman knew that I had falsified my financials, so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.
he forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin and then forced him onto the ledge.
it was only a matter of time before he fell.
at least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.
well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.
by 9: 00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.
by 9: 01, it's gone.
well, what if we stop the transfer? - But you can't.
what if we stop the transfer?
you'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9: 00 exactly, find the clerk, get the routing number.
we gotta stop it.
there's no way.
every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, they'll all be after us.
you could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.
it's not a bribe. Of course it's a bribe.
you're offering to pay us money to not do our job.
it's not a bribe.
we hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.
we'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.
first things first, I gotta go see Sheila.
no way, it's too dangerous.
look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow, but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.
all right, go. Go. Be careful.
Thanks, I will.
will you say hi to Sheila for me?
okay. - Okay.
tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.
he wants to make sure you know that he'll be there for you if anything happens.
Yeah. - Drop of a hat, I'm there.
look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.
if something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.
all of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.
why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?
just go, man.
okay. Thanks.
go.
Janeco Gallery.
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.
please pick up.
hello.
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.
you know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.
baby, where are you? I wanna see you.
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.
do you remember?
okay, yeah, I got it.
I'm just warning you, though.
watch out. I think they're watching the house.
don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...
after all those years, after the restraining order.
I was worried I might not see you again.
there's some very dangerous people after him, and now they're after us.
it's just the old lady.
Hello, Allen.
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.
she also says... - Yes.
she wants you on top of her, holding her hair, and riding her like a bucking bronco while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey."
you, you tell your daughter...
he said he'll always love you.
and he's so happy that you're having his child.
Allen.
he also says that he wants you to stare into each other's eyes without blinking while you do it.
I love when we do that, Mom. And then afterward, lick the sex off each other.
I don't wanna do this.
you say things that are too personal.
okay, but just one more thing.
she said she loves you, and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.
come on. That's not all she said.
no.
she says other things, but I don't want... - Please, please, please.
you don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.
okay.
she says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones and have a three-day F marathon. - That's more like it. Yeah.
she wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.
that's just lovely.
no more! He says things I can't say.
it involves a mannequin hand and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.
now what'd she say?
she says she loves you.
I'm so sorry about everything.
and I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.
and the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning and intelligent and wonderful you are,
I'd just lose you. - Shut up, Allen. I love you.
we have a place that's safe. All right.
I'm gonna break your hip.
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.
I brought some music.
not what I would've chosen, but screw it.
all right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.
let's do it.
you want my gate code? Shut up, man!
that's Wesley!
Yes!
Where'd you learn to drive like that? - Grand Theft Auto!
shit, Allen, they're coming.
Oh, my God! - Shit.
do something, Allen! - Hold on, hold on.
someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.
I did that!
I did that! - Oh, my God!
that's what I'm talking about! - We jackknifed them!
did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.
gator turns vans upside-down like they're in a crazy washing machine!
why are you calling yourself Gator?
it's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.
he was a pimp. - Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.
is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?
my poor car.
right now the streets are a bloodbath.
and, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here, 10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.
got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.
one, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.
it's a good tip. - Yeah. Two...
gentlemen, we got a hot one.
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.
Yes! Gun, gun!
pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.
there we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?
good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?
I do!
all right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.
move! Let's go. Come on!
cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.
Jesus!
who are those guys? - They're Chechen investors.
we were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.
anyway, it went terribly wrong.
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!
Oh, no.
damn it.
watch your head. God, your hair is soft.
VO5 Hot Oil.
you're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!
I'm not gonna wreck!
I'm gonna wreck! You're right! - You want me to drive?
this was a very clever idea. - Yeah.
they're gone.
let's go.
they are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.
this is a shortcut. - Are you kidding me?
you cannot go down there.
what are you doing?
hit him!
where are we? - Chelsea Pier.
what the hell?
Jesus!
them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.
go!
come on!
we're cops! Hit the chopper!
this is Martin and Fosse, en route.
back off! This is our collar!
set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!
take the light!
do not authorize that transfer.
this is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.
he will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.
tell him! - Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.
approve it.
now.
do not touch anything!
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.
not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.
yeah?
thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.
they're at 30 million, and holding.
wait! Can't you let me... - Take him away.
but computers.
what if, one day, they were in charge?
now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.
that's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.
now!
you just stood there!
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?
I knew what that meant. Shut up.
you kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.
who's got the golden goose now, huh? - Yeah.
shit!
he's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.
he immediately called your bluff.
get up. And kill the police.
I just wanna make sure I get it right.
did you want this transfer approved or not approved?
you, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.
police, don't move! Drop your weapons!
drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.
police! Down on the ground! Let me see your hands!
Hey, hey, you okay? Hey.
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - That's okay. Don't worry about it.
you can call me Gene when we're not in the office.
okay. Thanks for coming by.
Attaboy.
come on, stay with me. Stay with me.
we're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!
no. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting.
I'm just resting.
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? - I'm just resting.
are you all right? - Just resting.
Hey, let me tell you something.
as far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.
you know why? - Why?
come on.
what? - It's not funny anymore.
I don't know what you're talking about. - TLC references.
still nothing. I swear to you.
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry.
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.
it was the king of the mutt cases, but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.
within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme and Lendl's massive losses, the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.
Lendl is in everything, and we're gonna go everywhere...
they were too big to fail.
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.
he still invests. Currency's just different.
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.
it only showed the back of their heads.
but Allen's Faceback app was able to get a match to their faces.
Terry married Francine.
he played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.
he had learned how to play it in the eighth grade to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.
let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.
but guess what?
the people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference, you don't see them on TV or on the front page.
I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.
come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.
see? That's a no-go. - Hey, hey.
you think you broke this Ershon case open?
you did nothing.
corporate lobbyists are spending millions to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.
Derek Jeter?
Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.
I told you! - They knew by putting someone like you with a quick trigger finger next to that door where I do my pre-game walk, it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.
now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry, and I was close. I was real close.
so I forgive you, Terry.
I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.
I'm glad you're doing better.
the whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.
and the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?
the same corporations that own the government.
courts and the law is all we have left.
so here's you guys' next case.
guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.
he took three billion in TARP funds.
he's crooked. He's real crooked.
take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.
Thanks, Derek.
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you, get some more information or some tickets or something?
what just happened?
POWEREDY BY 100% VEGETABLE OIL
goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.
Hi. Cute glasses.
what was that? - What?
what? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?
honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.
tell me who you lost your virginity to.
she actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.
Heather Locklear, what?
you've heard of her? - Come on!
she was much chubbier back then.
I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.
that was you. You don't have a sense of humor.
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.
if you say something funny, I'll laugh.
all right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.
please. I love jokes.
all right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.
it's time to get laid. - Already feels inappropriate.
so he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss, "look, I know usually you want money, but I don't have any money and it's my birthday."
do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?
was he a farmer? - No.
that's probably a Health Code violation, bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.
they weren't gonna have sex with the duck!
no, I just mean Health Code violation to have the duck brought into a facility like that.
so, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it."
so he goes in there, gives it to her.
he gives her what?
the high, hard one! She loves it.
she goes, " You know what"?
if you do that again, I'll give you your duck back.
it's like getting laid twice for free. - So... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
the duck is payment for sexual intercourse. - Yes. Yes.
very good. - He used the duck as payment, and now he's being paid back the duck.
he goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever.
he does it again.
now he's walking home, right? Walking...
so she was satisfied with duck.
with a duck as currency... - Yes.
to her. Great. Good.
so he's walking home, now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?
he's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom, truck comes by and runs over his duck.
kills the duck? - Killed the duck.
so the duck is now dead. - The duck is dead.
the kid starts crying, truck driver stops, he's all upset, he didn't mean... - Of course he's crying!
he's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice, and he watched his beloved duck die.
will you shut up and let me tell the story?
so far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.
the guy feels so bad about killing the duck, he gives him two dollars.
and the kid's happy with the two bucks?
he's ecstatic! He got laid twice, and now he's got two dollars on top of it.
seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.
so he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?"
tell me! Tell me!
he goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck, I got a duck for the fuck, and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!
so it's like a limerick.
you didn't think that was funny?
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure, the way all the words were put together, but in terms of content?
no.
stop it. Stop it. Stop it.
and cut.
look at that lady's shoes!
thanks for letting me skip school, mom.
you're just the best.
Yeah, well, it is quite a show, and the show hasn't even started yet.
Where's aunt linda? -- I don't know.
can't we go inside? I'm dying to see cousin Sofie.
I can't believe she's opening fashion week.
God, the traffic.
and the parking rates are outrageous. You know they hiked them up for all this.
well, look who's bringing sexy back.
Oh, stop it.
it looks beautiful. -- Mom's not kidding.
you look fierce.
Ah, so do you. Let's go.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.
there's a tag. Let me just... -- Oh, no, no. Don't touch it.
I'm returning it tomorrow.
I know. I know. I'm a horrible person.
I already said a preemptive novena.
this smells like a wendy thing.
you know me and my sister.
you graduated at the top of your class.
you spent ten years on the floor at kings general, and you are a World-Class mom.
you're sweet.
all she sees is that I still bear the scarlet letter of new york city.
the dreaded 718 Staten Island area code.
I think it's cool.
I do, too. -- Speaking of which...
Hi!
Hi.
look at you!
is this Bianco Alessi, Linda?
that must have set Daniel back some change.
look at you. If I had those cheekbones.
how's the commissioner?
good. Thank you.
what a scare, huh?
don't tell me that's Nicky.
you have blossomed overnight. -- It's been two years.
I heard that.
I am so excited you guys are here.
this is the day we've been working for since Sofie started modeling.
backstage is a madhouse. We can't all go.
you guys find your seats.
you are coming with me.
okay.
Oh, god, Harry.
my stomach is doing flip-flops.
breathe deep, sweetheart. You're gonna blow their socks off.
Oh, my god! Auntie Linda!
Hi! - Hi!
down girl. I'm curling. This thing's hot.
Harry, this is my aunt Linda. This is my friend Harry.
how are the butterflies, sweetie?
it's my first big show, mom. Awful.
Uh-oh. Incoming. -- Here's our little catalog girl.
big day for you, sweetie.
just be careful you don't fall down out there.
you're still here, Cameron?
what happened to my mineral water?
Ex-supermodel with a TV show.
I guess page six wasn't lying about Milli Skye.
I mean, talk about toxic.
she was just trying to jinx you, Sofie, and it won't work if you don't let it.
I just can't wait for this to start.
we are so proud of you, Sof.
why don't you go on in, Linda, and let her focus?
okay.
this is exactly what I don't want to see when I open the paper.
some pedestrian's photo of one of my officers behind the wheel of his RMP texting.
no, I don't want to see the officer.
I want his boss to come to the 14th floor forthwith.
my day, we used to have to pull them out of bars.
I worked the breakfast line at comforting community this morning in the church's basement.
one of our parishioners gave me some unsettling news.
this is turkey, right? -- Yeah.
it's dark meat? -- I said it was for you.
I don't even want to talk about it out loud because it might make it come true.
she heard that father Mcmurray is leaving.
has he got some kind of health issue?
Nah.
Lucy's pretty plugged in to St. Luke's.
she said they're transferring him to Bolivia.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
it's a little late in the day for that kind of change.
I don't want to even think about St. Luke's without him.
he's meant so much to the family.
buried my betty.
Mary and Joe, too.
I thought he was going to bury me.
Oh, aunt Wendy, this is beyond incredible.
Erin, you...
Oh, please.
there she is.
Oh... my... god. -- She's stunning.
Oh, my god. Sofie!
Sofie, wake up. -- Call 911.
is there a doctor?!
I know CPR. -- What's happening?
what's going on?
she has a pulse. She's just unresponsive.
stay with her.
Oh my god, Milli. -- Somebody do something.
can you hear me? - She just collapsed.
I don't know what happened.
she wasn't feeling good. I pushed her.
you couldn't have stopped her from going out there, Wendy.
people think these models starve themselves or go on drugs, but not Sofie.
and Milli's dead? That cannot be a coincidence.
Oh, god, Mrs. Lightner.
I came as soon as I heard. How is she? What happened?
we don't know. She's in a coma.
is she going to be all right?
well, they're stabilizing her until they can figure out what happened.
um, this is atlanta.
she's been a big sister to sofie since the beginning.
atlanta, this is my sister-in-law, My niece, my little sister...
Mrs. Lightner, can I talk to you for a moment?
it's fine. They're family.
we just got back the tox screen of the contents of your daughter's stomach.
I'm afraid they found a foreign substance believed to be a poisonous mushroom called amanita phalloides.
a mushroom?
the death cap.
it's one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world.
science class.
someone poisoned Sofie?
well, we don't know how she came to ingest the mushroom, But the good news is, now we know that, we can focus on restoring her liver function.
who would do such a thing?
well, that's what the police are going to have to find out.
bless me father, for I have sinned.
I has been two weeks since my last confession.
these are my sins.
I lost my temper at Sunday dinner, and swore in front of my grandchildren.
I was angry at my son.
Danny? -- Exactly.
what did you say?
the big one.
I see.
the temper, Frank-- We've talked about that.
I know that, father.
all right, say two our fathers, five hail marys and a good act of contrition.
thank you, father.
so, it took you two weeks to stir up one sin?
I heard you're leaving St. Luke's.
so much for keeping the transfer quiet.
is this something you really want?
I've had a good run at St. Luke's, Frank.
bolivia will be an invigorating new challenge.
father...
is there anything I can say that will change your mind?
I'm a parish priest, Frank.
I go where I'm asked.
these mushrooms that poisoned your friend usually take 12 to 20 hours to have this kind of effect, so it's important that we track the whereabouts of milli and sofie during that time period.
and Sofie's mother told us that Sofie was at some party last night at Milli Skye's loft.
we all were.
it was her annual kick off party for fashion week.
okay, was there anyone at that party that you know of would want to hurt your friend?
Sofie? Absolutely not.
she's the sweetest girl in the world.
besides, she hasn't even been in this business long enough to make any enemies.
okay, what about Milli? Is there anyone who would want to hurt her?
everybody. -- Everybody?
Atlanta! Oh, my god. -- Harry.
what's going on? Where is she? -- Sofie's on a respirator and dialysis.
it's horrible. And she's got swelling on her brain.
does dorian know?
who's Dorian?
it's sofie's new boyfriend.
and who is this?
Oh, this is Harry.
he's my best friend, and Sofie's hairdresser.
Hi.
these are the Detectives. They were just wondering if there was anybody at the party last night who would want to see Milli dead.
everybody.
okay.
Yeah, Reagan, I don't know.
I don't know anything about, you know, fashion models and-and poisonous mushrooms.
I don't, either, but I'm doing it for my wife, for her sister.
Oh, the sister I don't hear anything nice about.
and you never will hear anything good about her,
but unfortunately, her daughter's in a coma, 'Cause someone tried to kill her, and they did kill Milli.
all right, okay.
thank you for seeing me, father.
I called you father.
old habits die hard, your excellency.
well, it's never too soon to start talking about security for the pope's visit next year.
what are you really doing here, Francis?
you always could see through me.
well, it goes with the miter.
well...
I'm not here as the police commissioner. I'm here as a parishioner.
you want to know why I'm transferring father Mcmurray out.
I do.
the Reagan family has a strong bond with the father.
these are hard times for the church, Francis.
I've had to close six schools in our diocese, even our own St. Brendan's.
a sad day. I got a good education there, so did my children.
have you spoken with father Mcmurray?
I have.
he said nothing that would indicate he had a problem with the move.
Well...?
well,
I'm a cop, your excellency.
it's really more about what he didn't say.
something's wrong.
a woman has accused father Mcmurray of inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.
does she have any proof?
in the current climate, proof is not necessary.
Francis, you came to me a while back and reminded me that the church can no longer afford to sweep things under the rug.
the woman is demanding he be removed from st. Luke's.
we're facing the issue head-on.
this man buried my wife and my son.
he baptized Jamie. Father Mcmurray is a good man.
what this woman is saying is not possible.
it is just as important to exonerate an innocent person as it is to convict a guilty one.
that's what they teach us at the academy from day one.
I know you share this belief.
father...
in so many ways, I will always be the student, and you the mentor, so this is not easy for me to say, but you are not facing this problem head-on.
this is just another way of sweeping things under the rug.
to ignore this woman's accusation would bring tremendous negative attention, which the church can ill afford.
father Mcmurray leaves at the end of the month.
okay. Yes. Whatever.
what's up, Jack?
um, the mushroom samples have been sent to the dea lab in D.C.
it seems that they can figure out exactly what country these death caps came from.
great. When we found out where, we'll take a look, see who went there and when. What else?
Yeah. Well, our lab is going over everything they found backstage at the fashion show.
well, timeline-wise, Milli's party is the best bet.
well, that's good news and bad news.
bad news first.
well, the bad news is, the loft was completely cleaned out, and the caterers got rid of all the old food.
anybody getting the caterer's story?
Yeah, as we speak. -- All right, how about the good news?
good news is, while you were downstairs, this came from milli Skye's network.
it seems that she had a camera crew recording All six plus hours of the party for milli's reality show.
that is every minute of her every move.
well, maybe we'll get lucky, catch a killer in the act.
worst case, we get to see how the beautiful people party.
there's a young lady here to see you about the Milli Skye case.
are you Detective Reagan?
Yeah. This is my partner Detective Curatola.
you are? -- Cameron swanson.
I was Milli Skye's personal assistant.
mind taking off your sunglasses?
Mm-hmm.
I knew you'd catch me anyways.
kill Milli? Me?
I stole from her, that is all, and I didn't really steal from her because that money was mine.
let's say you were stealing and that's all.
why don't you take us back to the beginning of you and Milli?
that morning-- The morning of the party, they didn't have any lactose-free for her latte, so I used soy milk, and she start screaming at me.
I told her I was quitting, and I wanted my money, but she didn't give it to me, So I tried to leave, and she said I couldn't because she needed me for the party, and when I tried to go, she took her cell phone and smashed it into my face.
the black eye.
I just wanted my $1, 200.
I knew she'd be distracted during the party, so I snuck in.
I knew where she kept the cash.
I have it here, and I can give it back.
no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
if you quit, then why were you with Milli the next day at the fashion show?
she said she'd tell my parents I'm bulimic.
all right.
suppose we believe you.
suppose you're telling the truth.
is there anything you saw at the party that would help us find out who killed Milli?
anything you know, anybody acting suspicious?
tampering with the food in the kitchen? Anything?
well, sofie's new boyfriend, Dorian...
baby rock star Dorian? What does he have to do with it?
I saw him... saw him shaving something onto Sofie's risotto.
Sofie's risotto?
not Milli's?
I don't know. I told you I was only there for a second.
I didn't see much, but I saw that.
sit tight for a second.
I don't know.
maybe we have been looking at the wrong vic.
I mean, maybe Sofie was the target, Milli was collateral.
who would want to kill Sofie and why?
I don't know. I mean, boyfriend's as good a place as any to start.
what about her?
well, Milli's not exactly around to press charges.
knowing my track record with a certain someone at the D.A.'s office, they probably cut her loose anyway. -- Yeah.
Hey.
look at this guy.
we got a sector to patrol, and you're playing facebook?
no. It's just, uh...
everything all right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
so go, uh, inventory your RMP. I'll meet you in the lot.
you got it, sarge. -- All right.
Hello, Frank.
didn't mean to disturb you, father.
Oh, not at all.
back for another run at the booth so soon?
I need to talk to you.
please sit.
I went to see bishop Donovan.
the woman was a member of the parish years ago.
she didn't have an easy life.
she imagined she was in love with me.
we're taught to expect this as priests.
there were letters and gifts. And she finally made a physical advance, which I, of course, gently deflected.
and I thought that was the end of it.
and it was.
but after a failed marriage, she moved back into her parents' house and to the parish.
I think she feels shame in herself at the sight of me.
have you told this to bishop Donovan?
the bishop is between a rock and a hard place.
the woman is imbalanced, Frank.
she has a history of psychiatric illness.
but if we defend ourselves by revealing this, It will only bring up the church's recent history of having turned a blind eye to legitimate claims of abuse.
this isn't right.
and you falling on your sword isn't the answer.
Oh, I'm not a martyr.
the church has plenty of real ones.
I'm at peace, Frank.
I wish the reagan family could say the same.
eh, it's like a nest of vipers, bunch of phonies.
it's amazing. They all hated Milli Skye, yet they're all at her party.
typical.
there's Milli.
okay, this is Sofie right here. That's my niece.
she's a pre tty girl.
what's that?
that's her boyfriend, Dorian.
he's a guy? -- Yeah, that's a guy.
he's a musician.
he's a big, famous dude.
famous with who?
with kids. You know, young girls.
he's this new wave, new punk.
and you know this because?
stupid magazines at the hair salon.
hold on. Pause that.
what is he doing there?
the girl with the black eye, she said he put something on top of sofie's food.
well, he's doing it right there.
right. What is that?
it's like a mushroom or something.
it's not parmesan cheese, I'll tell you that much.
look. Look. Look at the frame in the back.
it's Milli's assistant with the dark glasses.
well, she said she saw him put it on there, so...
all right, let's keep watching.
Nope.
look at this. Milli didn't even get any of that stuff.
no.
keep watching.
look at that. Milli took Sofie's plate.
there. Milli got some. Just maybe wasn't by design.
Yeah, looks like she got a lot more than she bargained for.
Yeah, like being dead.
let's go snatch up this dorian kid. -- Yep.
mind if we crash the party?
cops! -- Shut up!
everybody, put your hands where we can see them.
kill that music right now!
we're looking for Dorian.
what's his last name? -- Dorian.
the rock star.
step aside.
get over there.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.
what are you doing with this, huh?
what are you doing? Come on.
come on, rock star. Come on.
look what i found. -- Mushrooms.
everybody in here is gonna cry.
everybody in here's gonna fry, fry.
I'm starting with the beauties 'cause they're so bleeping snooty.
look at all the models. Watch them die, die.
and now a model's dead.
it's just a song.
a song about killing models.
how convenient would it be if your girlfriend, a model, happened to die right when your new video was being released?
that would be number one with a bullet.
you think this is some kind of joke?
less than 48 hours after your girlfriend slipped into a coma and some woman died because somebody gave them some kind of poisonous mushroom, you're having a drug-Fueled party and flushing what appears to be the murder weapon right down the toilet.
I told you, they're psychedelic mushrooms.
well, I got a video of you shaving something that sure does look like a mushroom onto sofie's risotto at Milli's party.
what are you talk...
Oh yeah, you mean my truffle?
what?
I'm talking about a poisonous mushroom.
no, man, it's a truffle I bought at mario's charity auction to feed the needy. It gives me good cred.
that thing set me back two grand.
a chocolate truffle? -- No, no, man.
not chocolate. It's like a... it's, like, mushroom, but not a poisonous mushroom.
like a... like a tuber, I think.
Yeah. They're rare or something.
anyway, I didn't give any to Milli, and she's the one that's dead.
okay. Why don't you tell me what you did with the rest of this magical $2, 000 truffle?
it's gone. I gave it to a lot of other people at the party.
you got to ask yourself why they're not dead, too, right?
no, I don't have to ask myself anything.
but what I do keep wondering about is why you haven't asked any questions about your girlfriend.
I mean, she's in a coma.
you haven't even asked how she's doing.
I know. I-I'm sorry.
I-I forgot. -- Right.
your girlfriend's dying. It just slipped your mind.
Yeah. Well, see, that's the thing.
what's the thing?
she's not really my girlfriend.
she's not your girlfriend?
no. It was like an arrangement.
it was my manager and her mother.
Wendy thought it would be a good idea for Sofie's rising star, The red carpet And page six and like that.
Mm-hmm?
so this arrangement?
what did you get from it?
I'd rather not say.
Really? Okay.
well, you don't say.
I'll just charge you with homicide and get on with my day.
protection.
from what?
protection from what?
from rumors.
what type of rumors?
the kind that if a young teenage girl were to hear, She would never buy another dorian ticket.
Hmm...
look, the truth is that I was a lot more interested in her friend harry than I was in Sofie.
Reagan? Talk to you? -- Yeah.
I just discovered that Sofie was Dorian's beard.
Really? Huh. -- Yeah.
Wow.
well, one thing the guy's telling the truth about?
the lab results just came in on those mushrooms he was trying to flush down the toilet bowl.
they're psychedelic.
I guess the truffles weren't poisonous either, then.
I don't know. This is very confusing.
well, what we do know is that somebody tried to poison someone.
one woman is dead, and a girl is in a coma.
let's just hold him for possession of a controlled substance till we figure this thing out.
Yeah.
morning.
Hey.
any change?
she's breathing on her own.
the liver chemistry's better.
they don't think it was the musician anymore.
the mushrooms that they confiscated were a recreational drug.
dorian had no reason to harm Sofie.
they barely knew each other.
I know.
Daniel told you.
about the arrangement?
you must think i'm horrible.
it's, um...
it's just hard for me to understand.
what?
why I pushed my daughter to get mixed up in some creepy, fake relationship with a drug-addled rock star in the closet so she could get her name in the paper?
get her face on the cover of some stupid magazine?
you don't think I feel bad enough already?
I didn't say that. -- That's what you were thinking.
little miss staten island salt of the earth.
Wendy, please stop. -- You stop.
you blame me because I wanted a better life.
this is better?
there it is.
the contempt.
I was trying to be sympathetic, Wen.
is that so?
just leave me and my daughter alone.
Wen... -- Get out of here!
well, the woman has a history of mental problems.
so what's going on? Why are they kicking him out?
he's a sacrificial lamb.
I'm not following you, dad.
it'll look like they're latching on to this to excuse themselves for allegations that they've ignored in the past.
Oh. Well, thanks, Harvard.
you asked.
that isn't fair. -- No it isn't, nicky.
but it isn't simple, either.
if it goes public, it hurts the church.
no kidding.
I'm in the middle of a fund drive for comforting community.
if people get turned off, if they don't ante up, what's going to happen to all those senior citizens we serve?
so what do you think, dad?
I was kind of hoping to find out what you guys think.
it's a tough one.
I mean, I can see it from both sides. -- Yeah, me, too.
lawyers, what do you expect?
well, I'll take a side. It stinks.
I'm not talking about the legality.
it's not a question of due process, it's an ethical issue.
Yeah. Is the church making the father pay for its former sins?
Yeah. On the other hand, father mcmurray isn't resisting, right?
right.
of course not. He loves the church.
he's willing to make the sacrifice.
are we being selfish for not wanting to lose him?
are we putting our wishes before the needs of the church?
that's all well and good. But somebody should take a side.
he's a good priest. It stinks.
well, I think we should have faith that bishop donovan will do the right thing.
everything has a cost, even the truth.
but the reward for truth is a clear eye and a clear conscience.
who said that? -- Bishop donovan.
when he was at St. Brendan's.
I just hope he remembers it.
brought you some of Staten Island's finest, Jackie, and some fresh jet fuel.
thank you.
any results from the DEA in D.C. yet?
um, yeah. The mushrooms that killed Milli and poisoned Sofie, they came from Morocco.
and they were purchased fresh and harvested no more than a month ago.
you got any airplane manifests from morocco?
passenger lists for the last six weeks just to be safe from marrakech and casablanca.
this is from Aberia Airlines.
rock the Casbah.
uh, so far nothing on American.
but i'm checking air France now.
Newark to Marrakech, via Paris...
what was that-that hairstylist? What was it? Harry? Barry?
Harry. Harry Bell?
Harry Bell. Right here.
seat 30a, three weeks ago.
Harry, that sweet little hairdresser kid?
maybe. Why don't we go pay him a visit?
we'll check the rest of the manifests on the way.
okay.
I hear music.
Yeah, pretty loud. Maybe he's home.
open the door!
well, you know, the neighbors have been complaining about loud music.
right.
Hey, Dorian! A clean park.
new York City thanks you.
Oh, no, no, thank you.
I got 99 more hours of community service to do for something that grows in god's earth.
well, it may grow in god's earth, but it's still illegal.
the other day you told us you'd rather hang out with harry than you would with sofie, is that right?
Yeah. We had our moment. Why?
well, Harry the hairdresser's dead.
apparently, he committed suicide.
Harry's dead?
Yeah, that's what I said.
now, the problem for us is harry had just become our main suspect.
he was on a plane to morocco, where the mushrooms came from, but we don't have a motive or any reason why he would kill himself.
maybe you could shed some light on that for us.
Morocco? Yeah. That-that's actually where harry and I had our time.
but he didn't say anything about mushrooms.
you were in Morocco?
we didn't see your name on the airplane manifests.
Yeah, well, I don't fly commercial.
Oh. So you had a private jet?
Yeah. That's why I went to morocco.
Harry was working on a photo shoot for Atlanta's marrakesh spread.
Atlanta? Sofie's mentor?
atlanta was on a private plane to Morocco with you?
I gave her a lift.
like I said, perception is everything.
that would explain why she wasn't on the passenger list.
we're looking for Atlanta.
she just went upstairs for a smoke. Why? What do you want?
detective Reagan, my partner Detective Curatola.
you remember us from the hospital...?
don't come any closer!
listen, all right. --I'll jump!
all right -- I will!
nobody's going to jump.
just get out of here!
we can't leave you up there, okay?
we're not going to leave you unless we know you're safe.
so why don't you just relax and we'll talk about this, okay?
you have no idea what it's like for me.
I'm 25 and my life is over.
I've been working fashion week since I was 13.
I booked a dozen shows a year.
but this year?
one show. And I had to beg for it.
okay, you don't want to jump because of that. Okay?
and it's not fair!
I didn't mean to hurt anybody!
okay, you didn't mean it.
I just thought it would make sofie sick, and that-that I would get to close the lara fortunato show.
I put it in her risotto when she wasn't looking.
but I don't know what happened to Milli. And now...
Harry, and that's my fault, too?
look, it's not your fault. Harry killed himself, okay?
I killed him.
we were in this bazaar in marrakesh.
the shopkeeper had these mushrooms, and Harry didn't see me buy them, but he suspected me...
okay.
I told him that if he ratted me out that I would say that we did this together.
he's dead because of me.
no, he's dead because he killed himself, all right?
it was an accident; it's not your fault.
so why don't you just get down from there, okay?
come on down, all right?
come on. Don't do this to yourself.
just take my hand. Come on down.
come on down.
there you go. Come on.
come on down.
there you go.
all right.
Yeah, you just stand right there.
atlanta aka Lisa Jennings, you are under arrest for the murder of Milli Skye, attempted murder of sofie lightner.
let's go. Please. -- Let's go.
I'm sorry.
I was awful to you yesterday.
well, if it was one of my boys, I don't know what that would do to me.
Oh, don't be nice, Linda. I can't stand it.
had a lot of time to think about things.
making some changes...
if Sofie comes out of this.
well, don't even think about moving back to Staten Island.
you'd go nuts.
just saying.
she was surrounded by some desperate people, and I should have known.
I just wanted it for her so bad.
I closed my eyes to the truth.
you were doing what you thought was best.
every mother is guilty of that.
you would have known.
you would've seen right through them all.
I've always envied that about you.
you've envied me. Right.
Oh, I mean it.
you have always known exactly who you are.
you have never once pretended to be something you're not, not for anybody.
me?
I have spent my whole life trying to forget where i came from, trying to be something I'm not.
look where it got me.
well, I'm guilty of that, too.
I doubt it.
that wasn't my dress the other day.
what?
I bought it that morning kept the tags in it.
I was going to return it the next day.
Linda. -- I know. It was stupid and It was terrible but I just wanted to impress you.
you're a really sweet sister,you know that?
it was Staten Island.
mom?
Hey.
hi... baby.
mommy's right here.
thank you for seeing me, Francis.
please sit down, your excellency.
I made you some tea.
I see. Thank you.
I won't stay long.
I'm on my way to deliver a benediction at the UN.
they need it.
I always knew you had great things in store for you, Francis.
thank you.
and now look at you here in the catbird seat.
hot seat, sometimes.
tell me about it.
Oh, Francis.
we have such fine schools.
95% of our students go on to college.
they outperform every state and city test you can throw at them.
and to lose more schools...
I have thought about this problem long and hard.
Francis, when we last spoke, you reminded me of something.
what was that, your excellency?
the truth.
was I sacrificing truth for expedience in shipping the problem to south america? And the answer was "yes."
but now we're going to face this problem head-on.
how'd the board meeting go?
there's enough in the coffers for comforting community to fight for another year.
that's great, pop.
what's better, Francis, is that bishop Donovan changed his mind.
father Mcmurray doesn't have to go to bolivia after all.
always nice to hear good news.
we DO THIS, TOO, YOU KNOW.
what's THAT? -SILENCE AS A WEAPON.
make PEOPLE UNEASY. MAKE 'EM TALK.
I GET PAID WHETHER YOU TALK OR NOT, TERESA.
CBI's BEEN PAYING YOU FOR FIVE WEEKS NOW, DOCTOR.

call FORENSICS. RUN HIM FOR PRINTS.
who IS HE? -NAME'S WILLIAM McTEER, FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
serial CHILD RAPIST, SERVED SIX YEARS AT PELICAN BAY.
and YOU KNOW THIS HOW? -I'M THE ONE WHO SENT HIM THERE.
we're NEAR MARIE'S DONUTS.

Jane, WE HAVE A CASE. YOU THINK I HAVE TIME FOR GAMES?
life IS A GAME. YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR THAT. SHH.
Shh! I'M GONNA READ YOUR THOUGHTS.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN...
and OUT.
will YOU CONCENTRATE?
name AS MANY 20th CENTURY PRESIDENTS AS YOU CAN... NOW.
uh, COOLIDGE, WILSON, ROOSEVELT...
um, EISENHOWER, TRUMAN, KENNEDY, NIXON, L. B.J. -GOOD.

and OUT.
concentrate ON WHICH MUG IT IS UNDER.
I AM LISTENING TO YOUR THOUGHTS.

open YOUR EYES.
well, YOU DID HAVE A 25% SHOT.
we COULD DO IT ALL DAY, AND I WOULD GET IT EVERY TIME.
give ME THAT. HOW'D YOU DO IT?
you TOLD ME, LISBON.
our MINDS ARE IN SYNC.
in FACT, RIGHT NOW--RIGHT NOW I'M FEELING SOMETHING...
I'm GETTING IT RIGHT HERE. IT'S A... IT'S A NICKNAME.
saint... TERESA.
look, ANOTHER ONE. LISBON WAS LIKE A ROCK STAR FOR A WHILE.
what's WITH HER HAIR?
what's WRONG WITH MY HAIR? -NOTHING.
the McTEER CASE MADE YOUR CAREER AND YOU NEVER SAID A WORD.
you're LIKE A SUPERHERO WITH A SECRET IDENTITY.
uh, YOU WANNA KNOW THE DEAL?
fine. McTEER HIT THE BAY AREA FOR 18 MONTHS.
he ATTACKED 7 GIRLS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 6 AND 9.
I WAS THE S. F.P. D. INSPECTOR WHO CAUGHT IT.
I INSPECTED--TOOK McTEER DOWN. NOW, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
B. F.S. FOUND THE SHOOTER'S GUN A BLOCK AWAY IN A TRASH BIN.
they're RUNNING IT FOR PRINTS NOW.
inspector LISBON'S ACTIONS WERE LAUDED AS HEROIC "'BY CITY OFFICIALS AND HER S. F.P. D. COLLEAGUES,'
said HER SUPERVISOR, LIEUTENANT SAMUEL BOSCO"?
inspector LISBON DID AN EXEMPLARY JOB
tracking DOWN AND ARRESTING THIS ANIMAL.
well, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. YOU SHOULD GET AN ACT TOGETHER.
can YOU DO BARBRA STREISAND? -DON'T TEMPT ME.
so I HEARD ABOUT McTEER.
weird, HUH? I MEAN, HERE WE ARE AGAIN, AFTER HOW MANY YEARS?
too MANY. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO DREYER?
he'd BE MY FAVORITE.
Dreyer WHELAN-- FATHER OF THE LAST VICTIM,
KATY--7 YEARS OLD, PROMISED TO KILL McTEER ON RELEASE.
I CALLED HIM. HE'S ON HIS WAY DOWN FROM MARIN. -ALL RIGHT.
you're ALL OVER IT. LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ANY HELP...
for OLD TIMES' SAKE. -FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.
here's McTEER'S ADDRESS. PAROLE OFFICER SAYS HE'S GOT
a LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND. GO AND TALK TO HER. -HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND?
I THINK I'LL GO WITH HER. GOOD IDEA. -RIGSBY, CHECK UP
on McTEER'S OLD FRIENDS FROM THE PEDOPHILE WORLD,
especially THOSE WHO MIGHT HAVE MOVED FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SACRAMENTO. -SURE, BOSS.
Cho AND I HAVE A TRIAL MEETING WITH THE DEPUTY A. G.
not IF I THROW MYSELF INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC FIRST.
ms. DeRASK, WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WILLIAM McTEER? -HE WAS MY FIANC?
fianc?
you HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?
Oh, SHE JUST CAN'T SEE HOW A WOMAN COULD FALL IN LOVE WITH
a CONVICTED PEDOPHILE--NOT, UH, THE BEST HUSBAND MATERIAL.
bill WAS A GOOD MAN, A GOOD PROVIDER.
and HE TREATED ME LIKE A QUEEN.
and THOSE CHARGES IN SAN FRANCISCO WERE TOTALLY BOGUS ANYWAY.
that BITCH COP HAD IT IN FOR HIM
a "VENDETTA," IS WHAT BILL CALLED IT.
you GOTTA LEARN HOW TO CLEAN THAT TRAP, TANYA
that's WHERE THE CLOG...
Hey. -HEY.
it's THE POLICE-- ABOUT BILL.
my BROTHER CAME OVER TO FIX THE SINK FOR ME.
David. -PATRICK.
Hey. -THAT'S GRACE.
David, DO YOU KNOW WILLIAM McTEER?
I MET HIM A COUPLE OF TIMES.
he TREATED TANYA GOOD, SO, YOU KNOW...
anyway, I JUST GOTTA REATTACH IT AND YOU'RE ALL SET.
nice MEETING YOU GUYS.
you, TOO.
do YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO HARM WILLIAM?
well... IT'S PROBABLY NOTHIN',
but HE HAD A FIGHT WITH HIS BOSS LAST WEEK
came HOME ALL MOODY, SAID THE GUY WAS OUT TO GET HIM.
who's HIS BOSS? -SOME PIP-SQUEAK. I DON'T KNOW.
uh, XXXYZ INCORPORATED IS THE NAME OF THE PLACE, I THINK.
it's, UH, OVER ON WINLEY, NEAR THE HIGHWAY.
Hey, MOMMY.
Hey, EMILY, BABY. HOW WAS SCHOOL?
I CAN MULTIPLY MY SIXES.
wanna HEAR? -WOW. MAYBE A LITTLE LATER, OKAY?
bill WASN'T WHO YOU THINK.
Hi, EMILY. I PATRICK.
how ARE YOU? -GOOD.
good DAY, HUH? -MM-HMM.
six TIMES TABLES, HUH?
why DON'T YOU GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND HELP YOUR UNCLE DAVID?
it's OKAY, SWEETIE.
see YA.
I DON'T THINK McTEER TOUCHED EMILY.
see? I TOLD YOU.
because HE WAS STILL GROOMING HER.
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
you MET BILL AT A SHOPPING MALL, DIDN'T YOU?
near THE VIDEO ARCADE OR--OR THE MOVIE THEATER.
Emily WAS WITH YOU.
he WORKED THERE BACK THEN.
Yeah. REAL GENTLEMAN-- NOT LIKE YOUR OTHER GUYS.
he--he NEVER PRESSURED YOU TO HAVE SEX.
wasn't LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, BUT HE WAS JUST SO GOOD WITH EMILY. HE LISTENED TO HER.
nobody LISTENED TO YOU LIKE THAT, GROWING UP.
bill WANTED TO BE A FATHER.
my GIRL DOESN'T DESERVE A FATHER?
lately, HE'D BEEN ASKING IF HE COULD TAKE EMILY AWAY
on AN OVERNIGHT TRIP-- MAYBE CAMPING,
a LITTLE FATHER/DAUGHTER BONDING.
he'd BEEN PRESSURING YOU TO SAY YES, JUST A LITTLE...
but JUST ENOUGH TO START TO NAG YOU
a TINY, LITTLE SCRATCHING NAG
that MAYBE WHAT YOU FELT DEEP DOWN WAS RIGHT.
was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
you DESERVE A GOOD MAN, TANYA.
if YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT FOR YOURSELF,
then JUST PRETEND-- FOR EMILY'S SAKE.
we DONE HERE? COULD--CAN-- I GOTTA EAT. I'M STARVING.
Yeah.
all RIGHT.
you EACH ARE THE STATE'S KEY WITNESSES IN A FEW CASES THIS MONTH.
agent LISBON, YOU'VE GOT HOWARD AND ENG.
agent CHO, YOU'VE GOT RINGMAN, DALY AND FREED.
freed. FREED BIT ME.
and BE SURE TO MENTION THAT ON THE STAND.
Teresa, YOU REMEMBER HOWARD?
he AND HIS SYNDICATE STOLE $100 MILLION FROM THE ONLINE ACCOUNTS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.
and THEN HE STASHED THE MONEY AND KILLED HIS PARTNER?
I REMEMBER HIM. THE GUY'S CREEPY. -GUY'S GOING TO PRISON,
thanks TO AGENT LISBON AND HER COOL, CALM EXPERTISE.
that's ME-- COOL AND CALM.
so GLAD THIS ISN'T A JANE CASE.
you HAVE GOT TO TELL HIM, TERESA, THAT HE CANNOT THREATEN PEOPLE WITH BOMBS TO GET A CONFESSION.
no RUBBER MASKS, NO MONSTER SUITS-- HEY, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
B. F.S. GOT A PRINT OFF THE GUN THAT KILLED McTEER.
and THAT'S A PROBLEM? -YEAH.
boss, THE PRINT IS YOURS.
your FINGERPRINT IS ON THE MAGAZINEOF THE MURDER WEAPON.
tell ME WHY I SHOULDN'T BE THROWING UP IN THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW.
it's A LAB ERROR. IT MUST BE.
they're OVERWORKED AND UNDERFUNDED.
this HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH THE L. A.P. D.
just HAVE THEM RETEST IT.
come ON! YOU DON'T THINK I DID THIS.
what I THINK IS, I'M UP TO MY ASTERISK IN POLITICAL QUICKSAND.
you AND YOUR TEAM ARE OFF THE McTEER CASE, OBVIOUSLY.
I UNDERSTAND. ARE WE THROWING IT TO THE FBI?
no.
Hey, LISBON. HOW ABOUT THIS, HUH?
Bosco. -HE KNOWS AS MUCH ABOUT THE McTEER CASE AS YOU DO.
it MAKES SENSE.
and, YES, I HAD TO PULL SOME STRINGS.
thank YOU. I... GUESS.
no, NO, DON'T-- DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME.
if YOU'RE GUILTY, I WANT YOU NAILED.
I JUST DON'T WANT THE FEEBS STROLLING AROUND MY OFFICES,
asking IMPERTINENT QUESTIONS. -OKAY.
so YOU UNDERSTAND, I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS NOW?
nothing PERSONAL. -ABSOLUTELY. SHOOT.
Hey, EVERYBODY.
uh, WELL, I BET YOU WISH YOU WORE SOME GLOVES, HUH?
so YOU HAVE SOME INPUT HERE? -NO. JUST NOSY.
it's OKAY. HE CAN STAY IF HE WANTS TO. -I'LL STAY.
where WERE YOU TUESDAY NIGHT?
I WAS AT HOME, WATCHING TELEVISION.
nobody SAW ME.
What'd YOU WATCH? -SOME REALITY SHOW.
which?
cooking SHOW, WITH A MAN.
Oh, YEAH. THAT ONE.
the ANGRY MAN. -YEAH. OH, I KNOW THE ONE. THAT'S GOOD.
cooking SHOW. TUESDAY NIGHTS.
Yeah. -ANGRY MAN.
so I CAN, UH, SET UP A TIME FOR YOU TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH.
no.
I DIDN'T KILL McTEER.
nobody SAID YOU DID YET.
yet?
what THE...
good LUCK WITH THE CASE.
having LUNCH?
a DISCUSSION-- ABOUT LISBON'S SITUATION.
okay, CHO, YOU SAY WORK THE McTEER CASE HARD,
screw BOSCO AND MINELLI, YOU DISAGREE,
and YOU'RE NOT SO SURE. I'M JUST SAYING, MAYBE WE SHOULD
let BOSCO DO HIS JOB, STAY OUT OF HIS WAY. HE'S A GOOD COP.
is ANYBODY GONNA GO AS HARD AFTER THIS CASE AS US?
I DON'T THINK SO.
well, YOU'RE ASSUMING LISBON DIDN'T KILL HIM.
what IF SHE DID KILL HIM? WHAT WLD YOU DO?
what WOULD YOU DO?
me? I'D WALK AWAY. BUT I AIN'T THE LAW.
Yes, WE WALK AWAY.
Yeah. -I DISAGREE.
McTEER WENT AFTER LITTLE CHILDREN.
Hey, MAYBE HE DESERVED TO DIE. IF LISBON HAS THE GUTS TO KILL HIM, SHE HAS THE GUTS TO SERVE HER TIME FOR IT.
I'm GONNA TALK TO McTEER'S BOSS. -I'LL COME WITH YOU.
okay, OKAY. LOOK, LISBON DIDN'T DO IT ANYHOW.
I MEAN, RIGHT? SHE'S NOT CAPABLE OF THAT.
I'm NOT SO SURE.
what's UP THAT WE COULDN'T TALK INSIDE? I'M BUSY.
thought YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE OUTSIDE SO YOU COULD EXPRESS YOUR ANGER WITHOUT CONSTRAINT. -WHY?
I KNOW YOU LIED ABOUT THE ALIBI.
I DIDN'T LIE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID ON TUESDAY NIGHT,
but YOU WEREN'T WATCHING TV. -I DIDN'T LIE. HE MADE RISOTTO.
now THIS IS INSULTING. YOU GONNA CONTINUE LYING TO ME?
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT I DID ON TUESDAY NIGHT. IT'S WEIRD.
thank YOU. AND IT'S OKAY. THE MEMORY'S THERE.
we CAN GET IT BACK. IF I PUT YOU IN A LIGHT TRANCE
like THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. STOP TRYING TO HYPNOTIZE ME.
what IF SOMETHING TRAUMATIC HAPPENED
and YOU'RE BLOCKING IT OUT?
I DIDN'T KILL McTEER.
well, LET ME HYPNOTIZE YOU SO WE CAN BE SURE. -NO.
why NOT? -'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU INSIDE MY HEAD.
so IT TURNS OUT YOU'RE NOT QUITE DONE WITH THE McTEER CASE.
funny. -IT'S NOT MY CHOICE.
he'll ONLY TALK TO YOU.
agent LISBON. -HELLO, DREYER.
thanks FOR COMING IN AND HELPING US OUT, MR. WHELAN.
so, YOU GUYS ARE STILL WORKING TOGETHER?
still A TEAM?
we're BOTH HANDLING THIS INTERVIEW
at YOUR REQUEST, DREYER.
we JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

I DIDN'T.
glad TO HEAR IT. HOW'S KATY DOING?
she's WELL.
doing WELL.
healing BETTER THAN I AM, ACCORDING TO OUR THERAPIST.
where WERE YOU TUESDAY NIGHT?
at HOME, ALONE.
katy SPENT THE NIGHT AT A FRIEND'S. -AND WHAT TIME
you LET HIM HURT HER. -EXCUSE ME?
I RECENTLY READ THE INCIDENT FILES.
the INTERNAL S. F.P. D. FILES? HOW'D YOU GET AHOLD OF THOSE?
you COULD'VE TAKEN McTEER DOWN THE FRIDAY BEFORE-- A WHOLE WEEK EARLIER.
that WAS NOT THE CASE. I DIDN'T HAVE IT.
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO NAIL HIM ON. AND IN THE MEANTIME,
and YOU COULD'VE SAVED HER. -IF I'D ARRESTED HIM ON A HUNCH,
he WOULD HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED. HE WOULD HAVE WALKED. -BUT KATY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RAPED.
and THAT IS YOUR FAULT.
Mr. WHELAN. -WHAT?
you SWORE YOU'D SPEND YOUR ENTIRE FORTUNE IN THE SERVICE OF KILLING WILLIAM McTEER. WHY DIDN'T YOU? -I COULDN'T.
what IF I'D BEEN CAUGHT?
I COULDN'T LEAVE KATY ALONE.
my TAKE? MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS.
go TO HELL. BOTH OF YOU.
don't WORRY. HE'S ANGRY.
anger TURNS YOU.
Yes, IT DOES.
I WANT TO TAKE THE POLYGRAPH.
okay, RAISE YOUR HANDS.
how LONG DID McTEER WORK FOR YOU?
uh, COUPLE MONTHS. -HIS RECORD DIDN'T BOTHER YOU?
Nah, FREAKS WORK HARDER, YOU KNOW?
they're GRATEFUL FOR THE GIG, YOU KNOW?
not McTEER, THOUGH.
is THAT WHY YOU TWO GOT IN A FIGHT?
me AND HIM? NO. WE DIDN'T GET IN A FIGHT.
he GOT IN A FIGHT WITH HIS JACKHOLE BUDDY, DOG.
they GOT IN A FIGHT RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PLACE
busted IT ALL UP, SO I FIRED HIS TWISTED ASS.
I MEAN, THAT'S MANAGEMENT 101, YOU KNOW--NO FISTFIGHTS,
so I BOOTED HIM. -HE COME BACK AT YOU ABOUT THAT?
no. HE KNOWS BETTER THAN THAT. HE KNOWS I'M CONNECTED.
connected, REALLY? TO WHOM?
uh... PEOPLE?
so WHAT WAS IT ABOUT? McTEER'S FIGHT WITH DOG? -I DON'T KNOW.
could've BEEN ABOUT A MILLION THINGS, YOU KNOW?
dog WAS A UTILITY IDIOT. HE'S DUMB IN TEN DIFFERENT WAYS.

my FATHER USED TO HAVE BLACKOUTS WHEN HE DRANK.
one TIME, HE BEAT MY BROTHER HALF TO DEATH,
and HE DIDN'T REMEMBER A THING.
the WHOLE WAY TO THE HOSPITAL, HE COULDN'T BELIEVE
it WAS HIM WHO DID IT.
are YOU DRINKING?
is THAT WHY YOU'RE TALKING OF BLACKOUTS?
what I NEED TO KNOW IS, IS--IS IT POSSIBLE
that I KILLED McTEER AND BLOTTED IT OUT?
you CAN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER?
well, DON'T PANIC. THERE COULD BE LOTS OF REASONS
stress OR-- COPS CAN BECOME KILLERS, DOCTOR.
it CAN HAPPEN. -IT'S RIDICULOUS.
you DIDN'T EVEN KNOW McTEER WAS IN SACRAMENTO.
his PAROLE OFFICER CALLED ME LAST MONTH
courtesy HEADS-UP.

can MEMORY LOSS BE A RESULT OF TRAUMA? SURE.
your MIND SHIELDS YOU FROM THE AWFUL THING YOU DID
or EVEN WHAT SOMEONE ELSE DID.
child MOLESTERS DODOT GET BETTER.
the KILLER SAVED A CHILD'S LIFE, WHOEVER IT IS.
how DO UNBLOCK MY MEMORY?
maybe IT WILL COME BACK ON ITS OWN. GIVE IT TIME.
I DON'T HAVE TIME. YOU--YOU'RE USELESS
you AND ALL YOUR TALKING. -I'M SORRY.
until YOU REMEMBER, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP YOU.
Oh, HEY, LISBON.

you're INTERFERING WITH MY CASE. YOU'RE TALKING TO WITNESSES.
you're WRONG.

is THAT RIGHT?
Yes, IT IS.
nice COMEBACK. -YOU TOLD HIM.
he KNOWS THE SCORE.
may I?
Thanks. MY GUY AT PELICAN BAY CAME THROUGH.

nicknamed "DOG.
Hey, WE KNOW THIS GUY.

Ah, INTERESTING.
let's JUST DO IT. LET--LET'S GO.

no, I'M NOT GONNA HYPNOTIZE YOU, LISBON.
you're-- YOU'RE TOO STRESSED. -ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
no, IT'S OKAY, SHH. IT'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT?
I'd HAVE TO MAKE ALL THE STRESS LEAVE YOUR BODY,
maybe HAVE YOU COUNT DOWN FROM 100, 99, 98
we'd GO ROUND AND ROUND
94, 93... LISTEN TO ME, LISBON.
all THE STRESS WOULD HAVE TO MELT AWAY.
you'd HAVE TO FEEL CALM AND RELAXED AND VERY SAFE.
it's JUST ABOUT IMPOSSIBLE. I'M NOT HYPNOTIZING YOU, LISBON.
it's NOT GONNA HAPPEN, SO YOU CAN JUST RELAX.
you ARE NOT FALLING INTO A DEEP, RELAXING TRANCE STATE.

10 GRAND?
10 GRAND, SAM. -I HEARD.
10 GRAND JUST TO LURE THE VIC IN, NOT EVEN KILL HIM.

the ACCOUNT PAID OUT A MILLION DOLLARS TO SOMEONE ELSE.- I BET THAT'S FOR THE SHOOTER. CAN WE TRACE THE PAYMENT?
I'm TRYING, BUT-- YOU'LL FIND IT DEAD-ENDS
in A BLIND ACCOUNT THAT WAS CLOSED YESTERDAY.
okay. WE ARE WORKING THE CASE. WE JUST WANT TO
forget ABOUT IT. -HOW'S LISBON?
she's FINE.
she's FINE. WELL, WHAT DID SHE SAY, EXACTLY?
uh, I DIDN'T ACTUALLY TALK TO HER.
she--she WOULDN'T LET ME IN.
you're WORRIED ABOUT HER.
you THINK SHE MIGHT DO SOMETHING STUPID?
suicide? NO.
if SHE DID, SHE WOULDN'T BLAME THE BUREAU.
that's NOT MY CONCERN AT ALL.
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN HER OFF-DUTY WEAPON.
Oh, I'M SURE SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
Minelli ASKED ME TO DROP BY.
well, ORDERED ME TO DROP BY, ACTUALLY.
can WE TALK?
he's WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WE ALL ARE.
cause I HAD A MELTDOWN,
got PERP-WALKED OUT OF THE CBI
or BECAUSE I KILLED A GUY?
wh-- YOU KILLED McTEER?
how THE HELL WOULD I KNOW? MAYBE?
Teresa, YOU--YOU WANNA PUT AWAY YOUR GLOCK THERE?
very GOOD EYE, DOCTOR.
the GLOCK 9-MILLIMETER.
the SAFETY'S IN THE TRIGGER. HOW STUPID IS THAT?
I MEAN, IT'S KIND OF LIKE NOT HAVING A SAFETY AT ALL.
how ABOUT YOU GIVE IT TO ME?
don't LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
don't LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT. THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
Oh, WHOA, TERESA.
you UNLOCKED TOO MANY THINGS IN MY HEAD,
and NOW I CAN'T REMEMBER.
my HEAD IS MESSED UP, AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.
Teresa... PUT IT DOWN.
you NEED TO BE CALM...
and PUT DOWN THE GUN.
calm?
you WERE RIGHT, DOCTOR.
there WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
I ACT CALM ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT ON THE INSIDE,
I'm SO ANGRY, SOMETIMES I THINK I'M GONNA EXPLODE.
all THE MISERY AND THE PAIN THAT I SEE EVERY DAY
makes ME WANNA SCREAM, BUT I LOCK IT DOWN.
I LOCK IT DOWN BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE CALM AND RATIONAL,
because THAT'S MY JOB, BUT I WANNA PULL THIS TRIGGER.
I WANNA KILL.
you're ANGRY. I HEAR THAT.
I THINK I DID IT.
I THINK I KILLED McTEER.
Oh, SHH, TERESA.
if YOU DID IT, THAT'S OKAY.
he WAS A BAD MAN.
no REASON FOR YOU TO HURT ANYONE ELSE...
or YOURSELEL
I STILL CAN'T REMEMBER. -YOU CAN AND YOU WILL. AND WHEN YOU DO, TERESA,
when YOU RUSH THROUGH TO THE TRUTH,
all THIS WEIGHT AND WORRY WILL COME OFF YOUR SHOULDERS.
okay.
I WANT YOU TO VISUALIZE THAT SCENE FOR ME.
relive THAT MOMENT.
you WENT INTO THE ALLEY...
after THIS TERRIBLE MAN.
can YOU SEE HIM?
no.
well, YES. YEAH, M-MAYBE.
Yes. YOU SEE HIM.
you SEE THE DUMPSTERS AND THE TRASH
and THE CRUMBLY OLD BRICK, AND YOU SEE McTEER. -YES.
you SEE THERE THIS--THIS MONSTER WHO DESTROYED SO MANY LIVES.
it's TOO MUCH.
see IT, TERESA.
live IT
the REEK, THE GARBAGE, THE FILTHY ALLEY WALLS, THE FADED CROSS THERE.
God MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON WILLIAM McTEER,
but YOU SURE AS HELL WOULDN'T.
he DESERVED TO DIE.
but YOU'RE STILL A GOOD PERSON, TERESA.
you CAN GET THROUGH THIS.
the CROSS?
uh, WHAT?
the CROSS, ROY.
how DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE CROSS?
it WAS INSIDE THE DOOR. ONLY THE KILLER SAW IT.
well, TERESA, YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE.
no, I DIDN'T.
Oh, BEAUTIFULLY DONE.
lovely WORK, LISBON.
what ARE YOU...
of COURSE--THE CROSS.
you COULDN'T RESIST THE IMAGERY, COULD YOU, DOC?
lapsed CATHOLIC, PERHAPS? WHAT'S GOING ON?
surrender, DOROTHY. WE GOT YOU. BRILLIANT, THOUGH.
made LISBON COME BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK
so YOU GET HER FINGERPRINTS OFF HER COFFEE MUG AND DOSE HER UP WITH, UH, LORAZEPAM?
double DOSE FOR TUESDAY TO CAUSE THE MEMORY LOSS
memory LOSS YOU KNEW LISBON WOULD CONCEAL,
which MADE HER FAIL THE POLYGRAPH.
quite THE, UH, STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE, HUH, DOCTOR?
well DONE, REALLY.
your BREAKDOWN IN CBI-- THAT WAS FAKE?
and HOW GOOD WAS THAT, HUH? WHAT ABOUT THAT?
after THAT, ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GET MINELLI TO GET YOU TO COME AROUND HERE.
I've BEEN WAITING FOR YOU ALL NIGHT. -THERE WAS ONE LITTLE THING...
I'm--I'm JUST-- JUST ONE LITTLE THING.
the LORAZEPAM? MAYBE THAT WENT A LITTLE TOO FAR.
when--when LISBON COULDN'T REMEMBER THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER
even UNDER HYPNOSIS, I KNEW SHE'D BEEN DRUGGED.
the REST OF IT? SPOT ON.
very, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
Thanks.
not AT ALL.
you're UNDER ARREST. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
anything YOU SAY OR DO CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU IN COURT.
you HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY.
so THIS GUY WHO GAVE YOU THE MILLION BUCKS
you EVER MET HIM FACE-TO-FACE? -YOU WANT HIM?
I WANT A DEAL--A GOOD ONE. WHAT I GOT, IT'S WORTH IT.
two TO FIVE, MINIMUM SECURITY.
Oh, THERE WON'T BE A DEAL. WE KNOW WHO HE IS.
just CURIOUS IF YOU KNEW.
it TOOK US A WHILE,
but WE TRACED THE SHELL COMPANY BACK TO YOU, HOWARD.
you PAID DR. CARMEN AND DAVID CHARLES TO FRAME LISBON FOR McTEER'S MURDER.
these CASH TRANSACTIONS PROVE IT.
discrediting A COP IS SO MUCH SMARTER THAN KILLING HER.
we'd HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THAT.
but THIS WAY, HER TESTIMONY DIES ALONG WITH HER CAREER.
how ABOUT YOU GIVE US A STATEMENT?
maybe HELP YOURSELF?
how ABOUT YOU KISS ME?
you're PRETTY.
so ARE YOU, COMPARED TO MOST STATE PRISON INMATES.
I HEAR MINELLI'S BILLING YOU FOR THE GLASS.
it's ONLY FAIR.
you KNOW, FOR A COP, YOU MADE A VERY CONVINCING LUNATIC.
Jane MUST BE PROUD.
maybe IT'S NOT GOOD POLICE WORK,
but I HAVE TO CONFESS, I ENJOYED IT.
letting LOOSE FOR ONCE?
look, I'M GLAD YOU GOT CLEARED.
I'm SORRY THAT WE COULDN'T LET YOU IN ON THE PLAN.
you COULD HAVE, BUT YOU DIDN'T.
you SHOULD KNOW THAT IF IT TURNED OUT TO BE YOU...
I KNOW. -JUST SO YOU DO.
enough SAID.
I'm NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING, AM I?
no. NIGHT, LISBON.
night, SAM.
doughnuts FROM MARIE'S. OH.
I DIDN'T SEE IT. OF COURSE.
what?
he's IN LOVE WITH YOU. -DON'T BE SILLY.
I KNOW, HARD TO FATHOM, BUT, UH,
there's NO ACCOUNTING FOR TASTE, IS THERE?
hush!
Ultima National Resources have systematically ravaged the environment.
Walter Kendrick believes that he can get away with anything.
Patty Hewes had just sued us on behalf of a major UNR shareholder.
who?
I'm in this for me.
understood.
this is the man who was following me.
he's a cop.
he must have been working for Frobisher.
no wonder they haven't gotten anywhere with David's murder.
this is my first real lead.
Katie Connor saw you?
what if she talks?
we need to do what we should have done a long time ago.
Arthur Frobisher had your fiancee killed, didn't he?
she's been meeting with someone.
looks like law enforcement. I think it's FBI.
merger's gone through.
you ready on your end?
Yeah. Let's get going.
Kendrick overpaid to acquire that company.
well, if he overpaid, he must have a way to make that money back.
we have to find out what that is.
Oh! Excuse me!
Ellen, Uncle Pete.
uncle Pete's been with Patty longer than any of us.
he's really the one who runs everything around here.
thanks for the heads up, Ellen.
we looked into Uncle Pete.
his full name is Peter McKee.
dishonorable discharge from the army in '49, with a criminal record that goes back some 52 years.
a record for what?
all sorts of petty stuff.
burglary, larceny, bribing a city official.
20 years ago, he was arrested for using neighborhood kids to run a numbers racket.
all charges were dismissed.
and guess who his attorney was?
you got it.
and there's been no record of him breaking the law ever since.
Pete's been by her side for decades.
I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner.
no. We're getting somewhere, Ellen.
if Pete McKee knows where Patty's skeletons are buried, we'll find them.
I've arranged a press conference to announce you as my lead plaintiff.
I've written down some words that I'd like you to say about me.
don't you think this is pouring it on a bit thick?
you destroyed my reputation.
I want it back.
you're the only one who can give it to me.
so, that's why you're doing this?
for your image?
no, I didn't say image.
I said reputation. There's a difference.
ever since I got out of the hospital,
I've sought the counsel of a spiritual advisor.
Really? - Yes.
I have clarity now.
I made mistakes...
and I can admit that.
that's big of you.
but I'm no Walt Kendrick.
now, that guy is a destructive force.
he tears things down.
he rapes the environment for profit.
I don't do that.
I'm a builder.
well, if you're going to rebuild your reputation, a few kind words from me at a press conference won't be enough.
the other side is going to attack you.
I know how these things work.
and based on our previous experience together,
I'm sure you'll understand why it's necessary to vet your financials.
fair enough. You can have anything you want.
I have nothing to hide.
good.
come in.
Patty, you wanted to see...
Arthur, I'm not sure you remember my associate, Ellen Parsons.
Oh, yes. Hi.
Mr. Frobisher's going to be our lead plaintiff in the UNR case.
Oh, I can't take this noise.
this noise is the closest thing there is to musical epic poetry.
one more bump, that's it.
you have to pace yourself.
Oh, shit!
goddamn it!
no running!
Andrew, stop the horseplay.
Oh! He's a wild man.
listen to this, Allison.
a male sea lion can weigh up to 700 pounds.
so?
they can hold their breath for 15 minutes, dive over 500 feet, and reach a speed of 25 miles per hour.
so?
that's a remarkably efficient use of resources.
seals are stupid.
sea lions. These are sea lions.
they've lived in New York since before you were born.
I hate coming to New York.
Why?
new York sucks.
you know, when your great-great grandfather left Scotland, he came to New York.
so?
it's the land of opportunity.
if a man is honest and works hard, if he's productive, there's no telling what he can accomplish here.
go play with your cousins, Ally.
what is it, Dave?
I'm with my grandkids.
my trader got busted with a hooker.
he was arrested?
there was a mishap.
he was with a girl. They were partying.
so, the trade didn't go through?
no.
we'll try again this week.
find someone new.
I can't do that.
find someone new.
he screwed up.
but he's in a unique position to help us.
I have restless shareholders and a goddamn lawsuit against me.
I am not going to risk exposure.
you're on the national stage now,
Walt, which is exactly where you wanted to be.
if you didn't take risks, you'd be back in Appalachia ruling over the toothless masses.
look...
the incident was unfortunate.
it won't happen again.
I've had his name taken off the police report, but we have to take care of the girl.
take care of her how?
we need a lawyer, Walt.
one we can trust.
you've drifted. Stay present.
your breath is shallow. You're not focused.
I'm-I'm struggling with this press conference.
in what regard?
am I getting involved with these people for the-the right reason?
right, wrong.
what are your reasons?
I-I made mistakes.
I'd like to use my-my talents, my... my gifts, to-to correct things.
Arthur, if you want to change the world, first change yourself.
then your part in changing the world is finished.
I don't think I'm there yet.
it's a monumental task, changing oneself.
you need to become more self-centered.
I'm pretty selfish as it is.
not selfish. Focused on self.
one's aim should be to know oneself truly, apart from one's place in the world.
I may have to have you explain that to me again.
breathe.
rage without focus isn't a strategy.
Frobisher is the only shareholder who is willing to sue right now.
we don't always have the luxury of choosing our friends.
if we keep Frobisher close to us, we may be able to get information that can help you prove he was involved in David's murder.
you should have asked me first.
but I didn't.
shit.
uh, coming!
Oh, Jesus.
now, if you're on a diet-- chicken, fish or meat
high protein-- well, that's what this machine does
chicken, fish or meat.
this is bullshit.
what are we still kicking up to McKee for?
the guy's 100 years old. - Shut up.
he's like a grandfather to me.
show some respect.
uh, if you go to Key Food, please pick up some fresh fruit.
you got it, sweetie.
Hey, fellas, we got a new shipment coming for you next week.
all right, the guy in the track suit...
that's Timothy McAdams.
and the other guy, that's, uh, Michael O'Shea.
now, both of those guys got rap sheets.
looks like we found a way in.
it's an improvement.
you got some body shots in.
if you were attacked by a guy wearing epaulets...
okay, Asshole.
I'm serious.
it is your fault if I suck, by the way, 'cause you're supposed to be teaching me.
I'm trying.
? how do you know so much about guns, anyway?
my dad was a...
violent dude.
he was a Marine.
I shot my first gun when I was eight.
he took me and my brother into the woods, gave us a Bushmaster A3, preached the doctrine of "one shot, one kill."
you making any progress on that Frobisher thing?
let's not talk about that.
I want to hear more about you.
like what?
I don't know. Anything.
what are we doing here, Parsons?
what do you mean?
you know what I mean.
Wes... - Let's have dinner or something.
I'd like to have a conversation with you that doesn't involve firearms.
you know my situation, I...
and I respect that.
but we both know what's going on here, and I don't want to dance around it anymore.
Hey, look, if it's just me, say so.
I won't bring it up again.
okay.
that's fine.
I'm sorry, Wes. - No, no, no, don't.
I understand.
same time next week?
Yeah, sure. - Okay.
this is definitely him.
so, when I filed my complaint with Internal Affairs...
the wrong person must have found out about it.
someone decided this guy is a liability.
we've lost our only lead.
I should have listened to you.
I don't blame you for being anxious.
David's dead, and Frobisher's still out there, but...
these are powerful people.
there's clearly corruption.
we can't go through the normal channels.
and we can't turn on each other.
what else do you know about him?
Patty's investigator found out he moonlighted for a security firm
calder Protective Services.
we're still finding out exactly what kind of work he did there.
Mr. Frobisher.
what the hell are you doing here?
you're going to pull out of this lawsuit.
how did you find me?
and you're going to stop all contact with Patty Hewes.
no, actually, I'm not.
how is this any of your goddamn business?
you need to be very careful right now.
you don't want to be in the spotlight.
why is that?
Katie Connor is back in the picture.
no, no, no, no.
no, I'm-I'm through with that.
no, I've moved on. Uh-uh.
you don't get to do that.
look, asshole,
I've been through some really rough shit recently.
I'm not that guy anymore.
you started this, Mr. Frobisher.
the decision was yours.
no one forced you to make it.
you said so yourself.
once you go down this road, there's no turning back.
watch me.
your Honor, the defendant was caught with more than an eighth of an ounce of cocaine, which she readily admits was hers.
that's a class E felony.
we don't dispute that, but my client has no prior felony drug convictions.
this is a first-time offense.
how about her two arrests for prostitution?
you saw her record.
you know both counts were dismissed.
your Honor, Ms. Samble works as an escort.
the service she provides is purely social.
regardless, her profession is immaterial here.
agreed.
stick to the facts, counsel.
and make sure they're relevant.
thank you, Your Honor.
ms. Samble.
do you plead guilty to this offense?
I do, Your Honor.
in light of this being Ms. Samble's first possession charge,
your Honor, I beg the court's leniency.
all right, Ms. Maddox.
defendant is given probation, but if it happens again, it will be jail time.
my grandchildren are here for the rest of the week.
what do you do with kids in this city?
there's a reason I don't have children.
take 'em to a movie. That'll shut them up.
do you want to tell me what I was doing in that courtroom?
I'm sorry, Claire.
the john's name was blacked out on the police report.
was that you?
I won't ask a favor like this again, but you were the only one I could trust with it.
I don't care about the favor, but you can't be out cavorting in the middle of a major lawsuit.
I get the message.
and we need to discuss Frobisher's press conference.
Frobisher is just more bullshit media attention to keep the stock down.
all they want is a settlement.
no, Patty's not looking for a quick hit, and Frobisher isn't in this for the money.
he's back to salvage his name.
this is going to be a long, drawn-out proceeding.
what are you suggesting?
get the stock prices up.
do whatever it takes.
I've already lined up investors.
we're going to have a significant influx of capital very soon, and we'll make up the merger deficit.
and you were going to tell me about this when?
when the deal was done.
which it will be soon.
I can't do my job, Walt, if I don't have all the information.
once we get that capital, the stock will rebound and this lawsuit will be history.
what happened?
we got to try again.
the trader screwed up.
yeah?
Claire Maddox was defending a woman on cocaine charges.
I looked into her. She works for an escort service.
why would the lead counsel of an energy company be defending a hooker on a drug bust?
I have no idea.
couldn't find any connection to UNR.
so I checked the police report.
there was someone else in the car when the escort was arrested.
a john?
that would be my guess.
the name was redacted from the police report.
so, this escort is taking the fall for someone.
she must be.
find her. Run it down.
Arthur Frobisher is a great American.
recently, I've had the opportunity to get to know the private man, and I have been deeply impressed by his character and his resolve.
I have come to see that he is by nature, a builder.
he is an inspiring human being whose passion in life is to create, not destroy.
I am pleased that we have set aside our differences and I am proud that I can count Arthur Frobisher my friend and my partner in this great cause.
thank you, Patty.
this case is about greed, pure and simple.
it's about a CEO, who has circumvented every safety and environmental regulation on the books and engineered a catastrophic merger, all to increase his personal base of power at the expense of his shareholders.
now, the fact is that I,
I was so impressed, years ago, with Mr. Kendrick's vision that I became a major stockholder in his company.
but time has tested Mr. Kendrick and he's failed that test.
so, now, as a person who has a stake in this company,
I feel it's my duty to hold him accountable.
and that's why I'm here today.
every man deserves the best.
what kind of work do you do?
does it make a difference?
not a bit.
so, what do you like, mystery man?
I just want to talk.
Oh, one of those.
it's gonna cost you the same.
there you go.
no offense, but I was hoping to see Susie tonight.
Susie's a very busy girl.
but she only sees a few customers.
does she have regulars?
we all do.
do you happen to know some of her regulars?
I don't talk about other clients.
Susie got arrested the other night.
don't know if you knew about that.
was she with one of her regulars?
his name's Finn Garrety.
I saw him a couple of times. He's a creep.
but Susie doesn't seem to mind.
he takes care of her.
thank you very much, Gabriella.
thanks for the drink.
wait.
you're all paid up.
you sure you don't want to stay?
you wanted to see me?
the only reason we filed this suit was to get our hands on those documents.
what are we looking for exactly?
e-mails, memos, anything that gets behind Kendrick's real motives for the merger.
Tom's supervising. I want you to, uh, assist.
all right.
hope I'm not interrupting.
stefania wanted you to have this.
try one.
what is it?
polish pastry.
uncle Pete's wife makes it.
you'll never taste anything better.
I didn't know you were married.
almost 60 years.
enjoy.
Thanks, Pete.
how long have you known Uncle Pete?
since I was a kid.
is he really your uncle?
he's my mother's brother.
and the most loyal man I'll ever know.
what's up, fellas? - What's up?
how was the ride from Jersey?
you know the tunnel.
we heard good things about you guys.
said you move shit quick, always pay in cash.
Yeah.
well, let's see it.
you got bonus features, original artwork, everything.
it's good shit.
Where'd you get it?
it fell off a truck.
okay... how much?
you take it all, I'll give it to you for nine grand even.
no, no, no-- seven.
come on, you can offload this for 20, easy.
we got seven grand right here, you want it or not?
all right.
count it.
don't bother.
Hey, Pete McKee?
FBI. What do you say we do this quietly?
Hey, I was just talking with my pals.
Yeah, I know. I heard every word.
three grand is a nice little payoff, huh?
come on.
how's it feel? Your buddy flipped on you.
congratulations, Uncle Pete.
you've graduated to racketeering.
and having stolen merchandise crossing state lines, you get to talk to the Feds.
and we got two options for you.
well, he's not gonna like the first option.
Nope-- ten years in prison; 250 large in fines.
no takers?
the man's not interested.
tell him what's behind door number two.
you go home to your wife.
you live out the rest of your days together.
you'll be there with Stefania...
when she dies of lung disease.
what's the catch?
you give us Patty Hewes.
this is about Patty?
of course, if you don't have anything on Patty, then option two goes away.
and you go straight to jail.
sorry, fellas. I've got nothing for you.
do you really think Patty gives a shit about you?
you have no idea. I'd be a bum on the street; I'd be dead if it wasn't for that woman.
you sons of bitches!
you have no idea.
Pete, I understand.
but you're gonna have to screw somebody.
now, who's it gonna be?
how long do you think Stefania's got left to live, anyway?
Oh, God, uh...
three, four months tops.
shame on you!
Yeah, shame on us.
but are you gonna give us Patty?
or are you gonna abandon your dying wife?
what do I have to do?
it's simple.
you tell Patty you got busted, you need some cash to pay off the cops...
she says yes, you get it on tape, we're in business.
no.
if I'm going to do this to Patty,
I can't see her again.
I couldn't look her in the eye.
all right, then what do you suggest?
I have evidence.
evidence that will put her away.
where is the evidence?
in a storage locker.
I got the key at my house.
all right, Pete.
let's go.
no, wait.
my wife will wonder where I went.
can I pick up some strawberries?
yeah... yeah, we can get some strawberries.
did you have fun with your hooker?
we talked, we shared some laughs.
is that all?
Hey, I was home by 10: 00.
it's okay if I fact-check that with Deb?
look, the important thing is I got us a name.
do I know who this is?
holds a doctorate in Advanced Economic Theory from MIT.
youngest guy ever to be offered a full professorship;
turned it down to work on Wall Street.
real maverick.
also a bit of a head case.
garrety is a commodities trader.
so what's Walter Kendrick's interest in him?
that's the kicker.
he trades exclusively...
in the energy market.
t minus 15 seconds.
Houston... ain't gonna be no problem.
three...
two...
one...
1899/12/31 0: 02: 00
Finn, what was all that about?
you're asking the questions now?
just wondering.
if you really want to know-- that was about money, babe.
it's all about money.
I like that.
good.
now turn around and face the wall.
we've got a lot of work to do.
we're good.
the trade went through.
all right.
I'll be in touch.
okay.
so, who's up for some ice cream after lunch?
okay! - Yeah!
we scoured Frobisher's financial records, and ran a background check.
I'm afraid nothing pointed directly to David's murder.
but we did find something interesting.
for the past decade,
Frobisher's had a high-end security firm on retainer.
the same firm your missing policeman moonlighted for.
calder Protective Services.
we have a lead.
because we took Frobisher on as a client.
thank you, Patty.
Hey.
special Agents Randall Harrison and L. J. Werner.
definitely FBI.
Ellen Parsons is a lawyer.
a thousand reasons why she's meeting with these guys.
then why the sudden interest in learning how to shoot?
she's scared.
she wants protection.
and what about the missing cop?
she still pursuing that?
I don't know.
I can't get her to talk about it.
you can't?
maybe I should take you off this thing, stick you someplace else.
okay, look, you slipped up here, right?
I'm sure it feels like you're walking around, and your dick's hanging out.
it's no fun. I get it.
but trust me.
she's not talking revenge anymore, right?
so let me play this my way.
what way is that?
Ellen isn't stupid.
if I push too hard, she'll shut down, but if I just step back, she'll come to me.
then I can get her to open up.
all right, whatever. It's not my decision.
you're right.
it's not.
if Parsons isn't talking, you'll have to try someone else.
who?
I told you Frobisher hired that guy.
we still don't have proof of that.
we need to look into the security firm.
but we're getting somewhere.
I understand.
Oh...
I don't believe it.
what?
Hey! Krulik!
you know him?
from grief counseling.
this is weird.
well, that's the great thing about New York.
you can run into anyone.
No! No, it's not like that.
I had a boyfriend.
Oh. - We just broke up recently, you know.
um, that's rough.
it just didn't feel right.
well, it's hard to know when you're really ready.
I think I'm ready for something now, but with Mark, it was just a little too soon.
shit.
I have to take this.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
what is it?
Pete's not going to be in the office tomorrow.
you arrested him?
Yeah.
and by the end of the night, we should have what we need on Patty.
thanks for the heads up.
Oh...
I was getting worried.
sorry I didn't call, sweetie.
I brought you some more fruit.
Oh!
these are Patty's clients.
sweetie, I got to get something from the kitchen.
if you don't mind, keep these fellows company, will you?
would you like a strawberry?
where is this storage unit?
ten minutes away.
McGinness and Freeman.
I got the key here somewhere.
there's a trunk in the storage unit.
it holds everything I got on Patty.
I'll take you there.
you're doing the right thing, Mr. McKee.
I gotta hit the can.
I gotta give Stefania her medication before I leave.
hey...
leave the door open.
what is case?
it's a securities case. - Ah.
stocks. We're, uh... We're suing the company.
Oh. - Mm.
she is something, this Patty, yes.
tough as nails.
but very nice lady once you know her.
well, she seems like a real doll.
let's go.
here you go.
huh?
we're going back to the office.
I'll be home in a bit.
no smoking.
? Oh, boy.
you poke it, you stab it, you jab it, you give the...
Oh, my goodness gracious.
let me take these knives and put them where they belong, - okay? - All right.
right over here.
that's that. Problem solved.
so, Ron, what really great, innovative products have you brought us here?
well, I've created the greatest knife.
a knife that will never get dull.
we call it the Showtime Six Card Plus Series.
which one is it?
third shelf.
the trunk.
what's the combination?
Oh, shit!
what? Why?
you're giving me late notice on this, but I'll try to figure out something.
say it ain't so. - It's so.
but you've got a plan. - Up and running.
all right, if Sam clears his throat any harder, he's gonna break a hip.
Kensi. - Yeah?
what are you doing Saturday night?
uh... nothing. I mean... Why?
G got tickets to the Clippers game. My babysitter flaked out on me.
his wife's out of the country.
you want me to babysit? - Now that you mention it.
that is a great idea.
we'll do it. - What? - Yep.
no, I want you at least 500 feet away from my kids, minimal.
what are you talking about? I'm great with kids.
Yeah. See, I'm not. Kids and me-- we don't mix.
wait. What? Are you one of those people that hates kids?
hate's a strong word.
well, you clearly don't like them.
no... - You hate my kids?
Oh, gosh, Sam, no.
you hate my kids. - No.
this... changes everything.
what? What does it change?
you're a hater. - No, Sam...
a kid hater.
Eric, I don't hate kids. - Sure, you don't.
this is Miguel Barbosa.
he's the kingpin of the Barbosa cartel in Tijuana, Mexico.
seems like every time we take one of these guys down, another five grow in their place.
each one worse than the next.
Barbosa was gunned down in a high-noon shootout with local law enforcement in Tijuana, Mexico.
wow, big catch.
well, they were backed by Americans.
navy kept Barbosa's reinforcements from arriving on the water, and DEA added firepower on the ground.
and here it comes: "But...
but Barbosa's corpse was stolen upon arrival at the morgue.
that's common with the cartels.
deprives law enforcement of a trophy and allows them to bury their own.
the shooter knew this corpse was coming in.
how long was he waiting in the container?
there. Shooter got there two hours before the body.
he knew the gunfight was gonna happen and Barbosa was gonna get smoked.
sounds like our side has a leak.
that's why he assigned us the case.
find the leak, track down Barbosa's body.
who ran this op at the DEA?
uh, Agent John Ness. He's with the L. A. office.
should be expecting us.
and Tijuana police have a high-value informant who's an expert on the Barbosa cartel, but they'll only release information on him in person and on their own turf.
all right, we'll speak with Ness.
why don't you guys head down to Tijuana, see if this informant has any idea where the body went?
well, Kensi should be fine, unless, of course, the informant is a child.
and yet I've managed to get along with you this entire time.
you guys have plans this weekend?
Yep. - Yep.
good-bye, Clippers game.
can I be of assistance, gentlemen?
Nope. We're good.
file on Ness indicates he's a serious guy.
practically lives at the office.
can't be bought.
an old-school gunslinger type. - Yeah, I heard about him.
he used to run counter-narcotics ops back in the '90s, Latin America.
his call sign was "Ahab"" - He's an obsessive guy.
congrats - Agents Callen and Hanna? - That's us. You Agent Ness?
one and only. - How you doing?
good. - How's it going?
good. So, does SECNAV really think I got Barbosa stuffed and mounted in my office?
not exactly.
because I think it's a damn good idea.
it's too bad the cartels got their hands on him before I did.
let's go talk in here.
we're not interrogating you, Ness. - Maybe I'm interrogating you.
it doesn't have to be like this.
if we're talking about Miguel Barbosa, it does.
hope you don't mind if I have a seat.
I stay standing longer than five minutes, my back goes into spasms.
you chased him for over ten years, huh?
ten years, three months, 21 days.
most of it in the field, the rest of it behind a desk after Barbosa tried to kill me and failed.
he's recording this session, G.
look, Ness, the Navy's not doubting you.
in fact, we'd like your help.
you know this case isn't officially closed until we locate Barbosa's body, right?
my men were on site when he was killed.
I was following the op in real time and received pictures of his dead face from the scene, which I confirmed.
my keepsake.
does that give you closure?
after the car bomb, I woke up in a hospital bed in Mexico City.
told me I lost my leg. Then they told me about my wife.
I called Miguel Barbosa from my bed, and I told him, "I will never stop coming." Take my other leg.
take everything I have, pal.
but in the end, I'm gonna get you.
we'll keep in touch, Agent Ness.
you know where to find me.
thank you.
cowboy. - God, I love Mexico.
seriously, this place has got four of my favorite things.
it's got cheap beer, it's got great surf, it's got, obviously, beautiful women, it's got sombreros.
stay sexy.
no me gusta.
so, how are we supposed to recognize this, uh, police contact of ours?
his department didn't give us his name or the name of his high-value informant.
s. O.P. in cartel country. Thanks.
but he knows what we look like. Wow, that is fantastic.
kid's not so bad.
there's that word again-- "kid "
Deeks... - You really don't like them?
I didn't exactly have the ideal upbringing.
maybe I don't want to put a kid through that, too.
okay, you really want to do this?
you want to have the crappy-childhood contest with me?
you and I get to see how dark this world is getting on a daily basis.
why would I want to bring a child into that?
fair enough, but, you know, this isn't to be shocking, but you don't have to do it alone.
I mean, it takes two people.
and if you didn't know that, I could demonstrate for you.
I just need, like, a cape, some tequila.
agent Blye, Detective Deeks?
Sanchez, Tijuana PD.
Sanchez... how do you feel about children?
cops don't banter down here. - All right.
Barbosa may be dead, but we're still living in a war zone.
Where's your informant?
the kid? - His name is Javier. My team...
I'll get him. - Move!
moving!
get down!
exfil out the back door!
you got to get better groupies.
if I'd known this is what it took to get across the border,
I would have tried getting shot a long time ago.
relax, man, relax. What's your name, amigo?
Javier. And I probably speak better English than you, amigo.
no argument there.
I want a lawyer.
Yeah, might be one back at the cantina with those shooters.
we can always dump you back there, Javier.
listen, we're on your side, desperado.
then why can't I have a lawyer? - Because I said so.
did you just drop the "because I said so" bomb on him?
so, what if I did?
what do you mean,"What if I did? " What, are you gonna send him to his room next?
excuse me? - Take away his milk money?
why are you guys arguing? - We're not arguing.
we are having a discussion.
why don't you just work on that ten and two?
Oh, what? - Ten and two, ten and two.
yeah?
put your hands on the wheel.
lady's crazy, dude.
kind of reminds me of my mom.
listen, I know this is hard to believe, but I guarantee you're safer with us than you are anyplace else.
I never committed a crime. I never hurt anyone, I swear.
so why'd those guys come after you?
okay. Thank you.
NSA says there's been no Barbosa-related chatter.
everyone's laying low. Could mean something big's going down.
same with the Mexican Federales.
if somebody knows about the hit, nobody's talking.
what did you guys pick up on the singer?
his name is Javier Ramos.
and he's not just a singer. He's a cartel celebrity. A narcocorrida.
minstrels for the drug cartel.
they make music that glorifies criminals like Barbosa.
like folk singers for the Mexican underworld.
javier was Barbosa's personal songwriter and performer.
so who stands to gain by killing Javier?
well, this cartel had some problems.
Barbosa's right-hand man wanted to take over. Pedro Moreno.
their men were taking sides.
it was going to be civil war, but Barbosa was killed before it could start.
civil war would have been ugly.
may have been some Barbosa loyalists left,
Javier's songs glorified him.
those people in Mexico take their narco music seriously.
maybe seriously enough to turn Barbosa into a martyr.
Moreno killing Javier would be the final nail in Barbosa's coffin.
end his legacy forever.
you guys, go home. Get some sleep.
all right. Good night. - Thanks.
night. - Good night.
I don't know. What do you think?
I think we need to talk to Ahab again.
this has been a memorable adventure. Are we almost there yet?
he asked you that like ten minutes ago.
Yeah, welcome to my life.
maybe we can just pull over for like a half a second.
I think I saw a cactus with my name on it.
seriously, Deeks, again?
unless you want me to pee in a bottle... again.
all right. Enjoy. - Damn it.
look, I... I don't know why those guys wanted to kill me. Honest.
they didn't want to kill you. If they wanted to, you'd be dead. Okay?
they shot Detective Sanchez first.
and then they took shots at me and then my partner.
never you-- they wanted you alive.
she's right-- somebody wants an audience with you pretty bad, and I don't think it's to sing "Hava Nagila" at their kid's Bar Mitzvah.
I'm not a snitch.
okay. Fine. Don't say anything.
I was Miguel Barbosa's best friend.
here he is.
you guys mind making some room? - Sure.
Thanks.
how's it going?
you boys hungry? Kitchen makes a mean mac and cheese.
we're good, thanks.
Sean. Give me two orders of mac and cheese for my sailor friends here.
an attempt was made on Javier Ramos's life last night in Tijuana.
dance with the devil, you're gonna smell like brimstone.
javier was a cartel groupie
his songs make kids want to grow up with gold-plated A. K.'s.
Pedro Moreno was part of Barbosa's entourage, too.
they were about to go to war.
any reason you could think of that Moreno would want Javier to join Barbosa in the afterlife?
you first, Sam.
you're crazy. There's no way I'm putting this garbage in my body.
come on, eat up while I think. - I'm actually allergic to dairy.
Oh, since when? - Since... that thing.
what thing? - That thing. Allergic.
I have to pass. I'm gluten-free. - What the hell's gluten?
I'm pretty sure there's nothing gluten in there.
to answer your question, Barbosa was a megalomaniac.
which means the only reason Moreno would even go after Javier would be to...
ness? Ness. Agent Ness.
get a medic.
agent Ness!
I don't think this is a heart attack, G.
secure every exit-- no one leaves this building.
Yes, sir.
he's dead.
what do you got?
kitchen staff reported one missing cook's uniform.
security cams didn't catch any unauthorized visitors coming or going.
killer's a pro.
Yeah, forensics team says he was killed by an aconitine toxin.
Yeah, monkshood plant.
guns and knives in a federal building get assassins caught.
Vegetation... not so much.
well, with Ness dead, we only have one reliable Barbosa source left.
any chance of finding the leak or the stolen body, it's gonna come down to one guy.
narcocorrida. Javier.
ever heard of DEA Agent John Ness?
sure. He's Barbosa's worst nightmare.
he has this obsession with catching him.
had an obsession.
ness was killed inside his own office building less than a half hour ago.
poisoned, killer escaped.
ness is an expert on Barbosa.
I mean, that's kind of like you, right?
you don't think your cantina adventure and the Ness hit were connected?
I-I don't know.
someone's tying up Barbosa's loose ends. You're the last one left.
we just need a name, desperado.
okay, you want to talk about Barbosa's enemies inside the cartel
what about Pedro Moreno?
Moreno? He's just a psycho.
Barbosa was more than that.
I was singing for pesos on the street when he found me.
took me in, bought me a new guitar that same day.
he wanted me to sing "Happy Birthday" to his mother.
he even let me keep that guitar afterwards.
so, he discovered you?
nobody ever gave me anything before.
my dad was killed in a cartel crossfire when I was a little boy.
Barbosa took me in.
and you paid him back by singing narcocorridas that would make him a living legend in Mexico.
we'd talk about music for hours. His ideas for lyrics.
the things Barbosa had seen and done on his rise to the throne.
I heard his hopes, his dreams, his fears.
and you got another father.
I lost my father, too.
he was an amazing man.
my dad wasn't an amazing man.
he was actually kind of a terrible human being.
but that didn't mean that I didn't miss him in some weird way after he was gone.
and I think my point is that I understand what it's like to have conflicted emotions about your father.
Barbosa was a monster to most people.
nobody can ever replace a father, but he was who I had.
it feels like you're the first people I've ever met who get that.
it sounds like Kensi and Deeks are making some progress on Javier.
let's go.
not so fast, gentlemen.
here to put out fires, Hetty?
put out fires?
this is an inferno to make Dante Alighieri blush.
how bad's the fallout?
bad, very bad.
as a matter of fact, SECNAV and the DEA director want to hear your after-action report on Ness's murder.
SECNAV needs to know that we don't have that kind of time right now.
well, you can tell him yourself, Mr. Hanna.
he's upstairs right now.
SECNAV is on site? - On site and unhappy.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks will just have to wait for you.
that's okay. I-I'll go upstairs and debrief them.
go to the boatshed. I'll catch up.
I'm not gonna send you to the lions alone.
I work with Granger on a daily basis. Lions are just another day at the office.
go, Mr. Callen, before the inferno grows.
I'm good. - All right.
what was the last thing you remember discussing with Barbosa?
anything can help us, Javier.
lately he was obsessed with the idea of immortality.
living forever?
no. Being raised from the dead.
resurrection.
talk all night about the Savior's second coming.
was Barbosa a religious man?
no. He just liked the drama of it.
see, his enemies would think they killed him and sleep soundly that night.
and come morning, all the world would know that Miguel Barbosa rose from the grave and brought hell along with him.
sounds like a song.
it was. I called it "Resurrection.
when Barbosa heard it, he told me never play it for anybody else, ever again.
and why do you think he said that?
he was a great guy.
a little crazy, but...
he said it would ruin the surprise when he really did come back from the dead.
we'll be back.
you thinking what we're thinking?
Barbosa's alive.
you done with the debriefing? - Just getting started.
they gave me a break before we get back into it.
ness was in line for assistant directorship at the DEA.
they want to know every detail about his death.
Callen, Federales sent us photos of the Barbosa shoot-out.
throw it up.
we think Barbosa may have staged his own death.
now, Ness verified these photos, but he's been emotionally involved in the case for over ten years.
he could've gotten too close.
maybe he wanted Barbosa dead so bad he got tricked.
gaddafi and Saddam Hussein used look-alikes as decoys.
it's not like he doesn't have the resources.
Barbosa has a lot of money and a lot less overhead.
he had a limited window of time.
once officials ran the DNA and the prints on this body, they'd realize it wasn't the real deal.
so they steal the body from the morgue.
it's gotten to be so routine with the cartels that no one thinks twice about it.
why don't you reach out to the DEA and the CIA.
have them keep a close eye for any communications to Barbosa's family or his top lieutenants.
okay.
I got to get back. Keep me in the loop. - I will.
you are sorely missed. - I could always...
keep walking, Mr. Hanna.
Barbosa's alive, Hetty. This whole ruse makes total sense.
in a cartel power struggle, the smartest move would be for all his enemies to assume that he's deceased.
and it gives him the element of surprise to move against Moreno.
unfortunately, Moreno's not the only one
Barbosa hoped would let down his guard.
ness.
these guys are as brutal as the Chechens or the Serbians ever were.
I'm afraid it's more than brutality we have to be concerned with.
our next move has to be made with extreme care.
we'll find him. - We must.
otherwise, Agent Ness will have died for nothing.
the joke that Barbosa made to you about resurrection...
we don't think that was a joke.
you think it was Barbosa that sent someone after me in the cantina?
well, we don't know that for sure. Could've been Moreno.
if Barbosa's alive... he'll know I'm here.
I can't go back to México. Even here, I'm...
we can put you in a WITSEC program.
that's short for... - Witness Protection.
there's satellites in México. I've seen the shows.
you'd live under a new name, a new identity.
it'll be a new start.
but you can never contact your friends and family again.
so I guess that rules out a record deal.
look, this isn't as simple as me giving up my lifelong dream for guaranteed safety.
there are no guarantees.
Barbosa has people everywhere. And in everything.
you're absolutely right.
there have been cases where the program was compromised.
there is another option.
help us go after him.
if we get Barbosa, he'll be placed in Supermax:
哈维尔，
even the top criminals and terrorists in the world are pretty much powerless once they're inside.
so, that would be the end of it?
we're not gonna lie to you, Javier.
we all know there are no guarantees with cartels.
but... I like your odds a whole lot better.
and obviously going after Barbosa's gonna be risky.
and we're gonna have to put you in harm's way.
but you will never leave our sight.
I'll tell you what, why don't we give you, uh, some time to think about it.
I don't like this, Mr. Callen. I don't like it one bit.
trying to lure out Barbosa not only puts Javier's life in danger, but also Ms. Blye and Mr. Deeks.
if Javier agrees to do it-- and there's no guarantee that he will
this is our only chance at bringing down Barbosa.
bringing down Barbosa won't shut down the cartel's operation.
it just makes it easier for his rivals to take control.
and then it's back to business as usual.
exactly. You just made my point for me, Mr. Callen.
right. But... consider this, Hetty:
you could have said the same thing about the Mafia in New York City in the '80s.
but it took more than ten years of RICO indictments and much blood spilled on both sides.
and look at New York today. The Mob no longer has a stranglehold on the city.
Hetty, we have to keep at it.
people deserve the right to see their spouses off to work and their children off to school without worrying about them coming home in a body bag.
it's probably the most important decision of his life.
Yeah, we're gonna do everything we can to make sure he stays safe no matter what he chooses.
we can't hold ourselves responsible for the consequences of his decision.
Really?
what? It is his decision.
it's not like we weren't honest with him. He's not a kid.
Oh, please. I shudder at the thought of your decision-making skills when you were that age.
I'll have you know I was actually very mature for my age.
probably as mature as a drunken 20-something-year-old in a Girls Gone Wild video.
do you know those based on vicarious viewings or is it something much more first-hand?
bad example.
cause I got my credit card ready and the pause button...
Hey, moving on.
that's not much of a decision, if you ask me.
what do you mean?
going into WITSEC with Barbosa still at large?
most WITSEC cases go without incident.
Yeah, but those odds go way down when you're talking about Mexican drug cartel snitches.
okay, and what are his odds if we dangle him like a worm on a hook in front of a barracuda?
Yeah, I guess they both kind of suck.
Yeah, they both kind of do.
you think we pushed him too hard?
maybe.
guys. - What do you got, Eric?
word got out on the street that Javier's being taken to WITSEC.
you got that sweet silver Range Rover?
keeping back nicely.
Yeah, but he's been with us for the last three random turns that you've made.
I told you he's got people everywhere.
turn here.
good timing, Deeks.
I make a point of wearing my gold Rolex to my garbage man job.
get down!
stay down!
get down. Javier!
damn it! - Deeks!
he's gone!
Fuera.
look
Hello, Mr. Barbosa.
it seems rumors of your death have been greatly exaggerated.
looks like the undercover up with the garbage truck was a success.
let's not pat ourselves on the back just yet, Ms. Jones.
Mr. Barbosa may be alive, but I'm afraid Javier may not be for very much longer.
okay, Javier's GPS has them at 9th and Grand.
Kensi and Deeks are both in position.
Eric, we got one security camera facing the parking lot and one guy at the door.
we're heading to the fire escape. You ready? Go.
everything I know show us how good you've gotten.
maybe I can start singing that resurrection ballad now.
your humor translates well.
tell me, who was it that got you?
FBI? Homeland Security?
NCIS-- U. S. Navy.
but I didn't say anything to them.
no? - No.
I'm sure you said something.
hello.
Where's the bathroom?
can I get a coffee?
well, yeah, yeah, maybe a little bit, but I-I...
stop babbling.
do they know I'm alive?
no.
I didn't know you were alive. How could I tell them?
did I imply that you did?
would you tell them, had you known?
no.
it's not that I don't believe you, Javier.
it's just that sometimes, when people talk, maybe you say something you don't mean to.
with all the questions and the pressure, sometimes maybe a little something slips out.
maybe you don't realize it at the time or you forget because of all the, uh...
confusion? - Confusion.
no. No, I-I swear. I didn't say anything.
it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
it's okay.
no. Miguel! Miguel, we're friends!
we're... we're friends.
you are closer to me than anyone, Javier.
that's more than a man like me can afford.
no. No!
Mr. Beale? - A few technical difficulties.
well, I suggest you fix them now.
in coming - Ness? - Barbosa... I survived.
I'm never going to stop coming.
you could take my other leg.
you could take everything I got, pal.
but in the end, I'm going to get you.
you're dead. I'll finish the job myself, then spit on your wife's grave!
how is it that Ness is still alive?
you said the poison worked. Finish the job!
you son of a bitch. You're dead. You hear me?
I don't care how many times I have to kill you!
can you keep him on the phone, Mr. Beale?
I could only cut together so much of Callen and Ness's conversation before it became conspicuously repetitive.
where do we go, Eric?
you're looking for double doors.
two of his men are still with Barbosa and Javier.
Callen, you're about to get some company.
sorry that it's come to this.
Mr. Deeks, Ms. Blye, Javier is out of time.
shoot! Do it!
it was the only way, Javier.
I had to test your loyalty.
I was never going to kill you. You understand?
Javier, he's lying. That's what he does. You know that now.
no. You're like a son to me.
you know that.
you have to trust me. Okay? You trust me?
we're going to leave now, okay? Let's go.
sorry.
Javier, you did good.
you did good.
I got you.
was it the longest debrief ever?
one day somebody might offer me a desk job
if I accept it, you have permission to shoot me on sight.
done.
javier make it back to Mexico? - On his way now.
now that his singing career is over, it's a fresh new start.
why is it over?
Barbosa and his closest guys are dead, he's young and talented...
and his record label is a drug cartel.
he should be applying to colleges.
that's right, that's what I'm saying
he's got other options besides narcocorrido, you know what I mean?
I'm sure that Mexico has their own version of The Voice.
that's what you came up with?
I'll have you know that the winners end up broke a year later.
did you get a sitter? - No. Out of luck.
you're gonna have to take someone else to the Clippers game.
Where's Paris Summerskill these days?
she's in Des Moines.
I'll do it.
you will?
I'll do it.
what changed your mind? - Yeah, what changed your mind?
besides the fantasy of little Martys running to and fro.
God...
I don't know. Just helping Javier... it felt different.
felt good.
this... changes everything.
thank you, Kensi.
I do have one condition, though. - Name it.
Deeks helps me watch your kids. - What?!
look, I am taking a leap here with this babysitting thing.
it would be really nice to have my partner there to back me up.
that is, if he takes me up on it.
you want to play house?
they want to play house, Sam.
at your house, when you're not there.
Oh, yeah?
I have nanny cams. Everywhere.
that's okay,'cause I do some of my best work on camera.
Oh, thank you for an image I will never be able to get out of my head.
is that so wrong? I'm just getting it done.
they grow up so fast.

I AM, AM I? OH, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.
how LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ROSEMARY TENNANT?
almost THREE YEARS.
do YOU CHARGE FOR YOUR SERVICES? YES. HOW MUCH DEPENDS ON THE RESOURCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT, BUT I NEVER TURN ANYONE AWAY. HOW MUCH DID YOU CHARGE ROSEMARY?
$500 PER HOUR. HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK?
five TO SIX.
Oh, 3 GRAND A WEEK. NICE.
rosemary WAS A TROUBLED SOUL.
she NEEDED INTENSIVE HELP.
what WAS TROUBLING HER?
her HUSBAND WAS A POWERFUL ANCHOR IN HER LIFE.
after HIS DEATH, I THINK SHE FELT ADRIFT, VULNERABLE.
and PEOPLE THAT SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE TRUSTED
recognized HER WEAKNESSES AND PLAYED ON THEM. OH, REALLY?
any PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR?
too MANY TO MENTION.
as A RESULT,
I THINK HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER CHILDREN MAY HAVE SUFFERED.
that WOULD BE CLARA AND TRAVIS, YES? MM-HMM.
suffered HOW?
I'm SORRY.
I'm NOT COMFORTABLE SHARING ANY MORE THAN THAT WITH YOU. MM.
Travis WENT MISSING SEVERAL DAYS AGO.
what DID SHE HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT? TRULY, I'D LOVE TO HELP YOU,
but MY PRACTICE IS BOUND BY THE SAME CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY CODES THAT ALL DOCTORS ABIDE BY. YOU HAVE A PROFESSIONAL THERAPIST'S LICENSE
with THE STATE? YES, I DO.
your CLIENT'S DEAD. HER EARTHLY VESSEL IS DEAD.
when HER SOUL COMPLETES ITS JOURNEY, I COULD ASK HER
if IT'S ALL RIGHT TO SHARE HER PROBLEMS WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL.
I RECORDED ALL OF OUR SESSIONS ON CD.
if SHE SAYS YES, I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU.
why BOTHER WITH THAT? WHY NOT JUST ASK HER WHO KILLED HER?
of COURSE I WILL, BUT SHE MAY NOT KNOW.
death DOESN'T GRANT OMNISCIENCE.
you're GOOD. I LIKE TO THINK SO.
Yes, YOU DO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOVE ONE'S SELF.
how DO YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF? OH. YOU TELL ME.
and FORGET ABOUT THE $500 AN HOUR.
I'm ON CIVIL SERVICE PAY.
okay, FOR FREE THEN.
I THINK YOU ACT ASSURED AND ARROGANT,
but INSIDE YOU ARE TROUBLED
with DEEP GUILT AND SELF-LOATHING.
a RECENT TRAUMA IN YOUR PAST PERHAPS?
but YOU'RE MORE THAN A LITTLE UNSTABLE.
you HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU.
you ARE GOOD.
please. NOT TO BOAST,
but I AM QUITE A WELL-KNOWN HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.
a MERE HALF-HOUR ON THE INTERNET
would TELL YOU THAT I'M CONSUMED WITH GUILT AND SELF-LOATHING.
one LOOK IN YOUR EYES WOULD TELL ME THAT.
and WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WOULD SPEND ANY TIME RESEARCHING YOU ON THE INTERNET?
a LITTLE SELF-INVOLVED MAYBE?
may I GO?
Yes. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
feel FREE TO CALL ME ANY TIME. WE WILL.
what?
do WE KNOW WHO'S HOME?
until TWO DAYS AGO,
the RESIDENTS WERE TRAVIS TENNANT, ROSEMARY TENNANT
and A SEMIPERMANENT HOUSEGUEST, NAME OF JEREMY HALE,
portrait PHOTOGRAPHER AND MRS. TENNANT'S BOYFRIEND,
according TO THE GARDENER AND POOL GUY.
Dooley. DOOLEY, COME HERE.
can I HELP YOU? MR. HALE?
Yes. CALIFORNIA BUREAU INVESTIGATION.
you MIND IF WE COME IN? NO, NOT AT ALL.
uh, SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.
looks LIKE YOU WEREN'T ALONE LAST NIGHT.
well, I WAS AT A, UH, GALLERY OPENING,
but SOMEONE'S ALWAYS HERE.
Rosie LIKED TO HAVE PEOPLE AROUND,
and, WELL, YOU KNOW US CREATIVE TYPES
any CHANCE TO, UH, PUT OFF WORK.
how LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?
uh... GOING ON SIX MONTHS.
I'm A, UH, A PHOTOGRAPHER,
and I MET ROSEMARY AT A SHOW.
I CAME TO DO A PORTRAIT,
and THEN I GLUE WE JUST KIND GELLED, AND I NEVER LEFT.
so YOU AND MRS. TENNANT WERE LOVERS?
that's WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.
did I LOVE HER AND VICE VERSA, YES. BUT LOVERS?
we WERE CLOSE. SHE UNDERSTOOD ME BETTER THAN ANYONE.
living HERE,
you MUST HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER KIDS PRETTY WELL.
Clara's ALL GROWN UP. DIDN'T COME AROUND MUCH ANYMORE.
and TRAVIS-- THAT KID HAS SOME PROBLEMS.
how SO?
I THINK AFTER HIS DAD DIED, HE JUST LOST IT
on DRUGS, STEALING STUFF, ACTING OUT IN CRAZY WAYS.
when WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM? OVER A WEEK AGO. Rosie FOUND DRUGS IN HIS BEDROOM.
they HAD A BIG FIGHT. HE SPLIT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE.
he's GOT A HUNDRED CRAZY FRIENDS TO HIDE OUT WITH. EXCUSE ME. UH, DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK AROUND?
no. GO FOR IT.
thank YOU.
rosemary PUT YOU IN HER WILL A FEW MONTHS BACK, DIDN'T SHE?
Yeah, AND I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY. IT'S TOO MUCH.
but ROSEMARY WAS SUCH A GENEROUS PERSON,
and TO REFUSE HER GENEROSITY WOULD BE TO, YOU KNOW,
deny HER ESSENCE. THE DAY BEFORE SHE DIED,
she MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER ESTATE LAWYER,
told HIM SHE WANTED TO MAKE FURTHER ALTERATIONS TO THE TRUST. REALLY? I HAD NO IDEA.
what DO YOU THINK THAT WAS ABOUT? I COULD ONLY IMAGINE IT HAS TO DO WITH TRAVIS.
cut HIM OFF, AND MAYBE IT WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.
Oh, YOU FOUND MY STUDIO.
she WAS QUITE BEAUTIFUL, WASN'T SHE?
you REALLY CAPTURED SO MUCH IN HER EYES.
it's LIKE SHE'S TALKING TO US. ROSEMARY WAS AN EASY SUBJECT,
and THOSE PHOTOS STILL DON'T DO HER JUSTICE. THIS IS QUITE A SETUP.
Mm. DARKROOM, STATE-OF-THE-ART EQUIPMENT.
it's NICE TO HAVE A BENEFACTOR. I'M BLESSED.
or CLEVER.
you SAY THAT TRAVIS LEFT BECAUSE HE AND HIS MOM HAD A FIGHT.
are YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? WELL, OF COURSE. I WAS THERE.
I THINK MRS. TENNANT TURNED A BLIND EYE TOWARDS HER SON'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE HE LOST HIS DAD.
he DIDN'T LEAVE BECAUSE OF HER. HE LEFT BECAUSE OF YOU.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I THINK THIS WAS TRAVIS' ROOM.
there's OLD POSTER TAPE HERE ON THE WALLS
there's STICKERS BEHIND THIS DOOR
and... DENTS...
up HERE, FROM WHERE A LACROSSE BALL WAS HITTING IT.
Travis PLAYS LACROSSE, DOESN'T HE?
he USED TO BEFORE HE GOT INTO DRUGS. AND HERE--THIS PANE OF GLASS HAS A CRACK IN IT,
right AT ELBOW OR FIST HEIGHT.
must HAVE BEEN QUITE THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN YOU TWO.
okay, THAT'S ENOUGH. THE ONLY QUESTION IS, DID YOU TAKE HIS ROOM AS SOON AS HE LEFT
or DID HE LEAVE BECAUSE YOU TOOK HIS ROOM?
you're IN MY PERSONAL SPACE. PLEASE STEP BACK.
excuse ME.
so YOU KICK HIM OUT OF HERE, HE HAS TO FIND SOMEPLACE SAFE,
someplace TO HIDE WHERE CHANGE CAN'T FIND HIM.
so WHERE'D HE GO?
he WAS HAPPY IN A SMALLER ROOM.
Yeah, I BET.
excuse me. BUT THERE'S A DEFINITE NOTE OF UNCALLED FOR HOSTILITY IN YOUR VOICE.
What--what IS THAT ABOUT?
he's JUST TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.
I KNOW TRAVIS TENNANT IS SUSPECT NUMBER ONE,
but JEREMY ISN'T EXACTLY GRIEVING RIGHT NOW.
I'll DO SOME DIGGING ON HALE, SEE WHAT I COME UP WITH.
who's TO SAY THE KID'S NOT DEAD?
maybe HE KILLED BOTH OF THEM. MORE MONEY IN THE WILL FOR HIM.
anything ON THE BUSINESS SIDE? WELL, THE PSYCHIC WAS RIGHT.
every HIGH-END CON ARTIST AND SOCIAL PARASITE IN TOWN
was HITTING SEMARY UP FOR A MILLION.
these GUYS ARE ALL WHITE-COLLAR LEECHES, NOT MURDERERS. THIS LOOKS LIKE HER.
miss TENNANT, I'M AGENT LISBON. THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD.
has ANYONE FOUND MY BROTHER?
please HAVE A SEAT.
we're SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
to ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, NO. TRAVIS IS STILL MISSING.
but WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FIND HIM.
can YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR MOTHER?
anything MIGHT HELP.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S GONE.
I MEAN, SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD PERSON.
everybody LOVED HER, AND...
for HER TO DIE IN THE GUTTER LIKE THAT, IT'S...
like GARBAGE, IT'S--IT'S HORRIBLE.
people SAY SHE CHANGED AFTER YOUR FATHER DIED.
she...
she SORT OF LOST CONTROL.
and MY FATHER WAS...
the ONE THAT KEPT IT ALL GOING.
and SHE JUST...
she WASN'T THAT PERSON.
could YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE?
when I WAS IN COLLEGE...
my BROTHER CALLED TO TELL ME
that PEOPLE WERE RIPPING US OFF.
and MOM WOULD INVEST IN ONE BAD SCHEME AFTER ANOTHER,
and I TRIED TO WARN HER, BUT SHE JUST WOULDN'T LISTEN.
I'm SURE SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING.
is THAT WHEN YOUR BROTHER STARTED ACTING OUT?
he MISSED DAD A LOT,
and SUDDENLY...
he WAS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE,
and I THINK HE JUST WASN'T USED TO IT.
that's WHEN JEREMY MOVED IN,
and HE'S SCARY. HE'S VERY DANGEROUS.
dangerous HOW?
he WANTS WHAT HE WANTS, AND HE HAS A VERY BAD TEMPER.
I WAS WORRIED FOR MY MOM.
clara, WHERE DO YOU THINK TRAVIS IS?
if I KNEW, I WOULD BE WITH HIM.
I MEAN, HE'S MY BROTHER.
he's... HE'S ALL I'VE GOT LEFT.
could YOU PUT HIS NUMBER IN THERE, PLEASE?
well, HE'S NOT GONNA CALL YOU BACK. EH, JUST PUT IT IN.
thank YOU.
Hello, TRAVIS.
you DON'T KNOW ME, BUT MY NAME IS PATRICK JANE.
I'm A FRIEND. I KNOW YOU'RE IN A LITTLE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW,
and I WANT TO OFFER YOU SOME PEACE OF MIND.
but I DON'T KNOW WHAT PEACE OF MIND MEANS TO YOU.
it's DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE.
for INSTANCE, I LIKE RIDING HORSES.
but WOULD HORSES MAKE YOU HAPPY? I DON'T KNOW.
why WOULDN'T HORSES MAKE YOU HAPPY?
go ROUND AND ROUND IN YOUR MIND UNTIL YOU'RE SURE,
and GO TO THAT PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU ARE HAPPY.
then GIVE ME A CALL. YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.
what WAS THAT ABOUT?
quick. WHAT IMAGES CAME INTO YOUR HEAD?
all I'M SAYING, YOU CAN'T SAY THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PSYCHICS JUST 'CAUSE YOU'VE NEVER MET ONE. YOU'RE RIGHT.
I've NEVER SEEN A ZEBRA. DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T EXIST. YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A ZEBRA?
no. YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO A ZOO?
you KNOW, I DON'T GET ZOOS.
you PAY MONEY TO LOOK AT ANIMALS. WHY?
guys.
that's HIM.
Jane, I'LL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.
you EVER DOUBTED ME?
one DOLLAR HERE. ONE DOLLAR.
Travis, WAIT.
just WAIT.
Travis WE KNOW WHY YOU TOOK OFF.
we KNOW ABOUT YOUR FIGHT WITH JEREMY.
why DIDN'T YOU CALL SOMEBODY? WHY JUST RUN?
cause THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD DO.
I DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY MORE TROUBLE.
cause ANY TROUBLE FOR WHO? THEY'RE YOUR FAMILY.
you REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
look, I LOVED MY MOM... SO MUCH.
but AFTER THE BLOWOUT WITH JEREMY,
I COULDN'T GO BACK THERE. THERE WAS NO WAY.
when CAN I SEE HIM?
Oh, SOON.
so WHERE'D YOU GO? FRIENDS' HOUSES MOSTLY.
we'll NEED NAMES AND ADDRESSES.
you KNOW, MAYBE IF I'D BEEN HOME THAT NIGHT,
she'd STILL BE ALIVE.
I... MAYBE
here's THE TRUTH, TRAVIS.
after YOUR DAD DIED, YOUR MOM GAVE AWAY A LOT OF YOUR MONEY.
then SHE MOVED JEREMY INTO THE HOUSE
and MADE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE. SO EVEN THOUGH YOU TOOK OFF,
you KNEW WHERE SHE'D BE THAT NIGHT. YOU KNEW HOW SHE'D WALK HOME.
are YOU SAYING I DID THIS?
when MY DAD DIED, MOM WAS ALL I HAD.
you DON'T THINK I WANTED TO BE THERE FOR HER?
that DIRT BAG JEREMY MOVES IN, HE STARTS TELLING ME WHAT TO DO
and BOSSING ME AROUND.
she WAS MY MOM. I DIDN'T KILL HER.
I BELIEVE HIM.
come HERE.
we'll BE ALL RIGHT.
we'll BE FINE.
Travis IS HURTING. OR HE'S LYING. LET'S NOT FORGET,
Jeremy HALE STOOD TO INHERIT A FEW MILLION HIMSELF.
so MAYBE HE WANTED TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS
finance A NICE LONG PHOTO SHOOT IN SOUTH AMERICA,
lay LOW FOR AWHILE? I HEARD FROM ROSEMARY'S PROBATE LAWYER.
guess WHO SHE JUST ADDED TO HER WILL. UH, KRISTINA FRYE?
ink WASN'T EVEN DRY YET. KRISTINA TOLD US SHE KNEW IN ADVANCE
that ROSEMARY WAS IN DANGER.
why WOULD SHE TELL US THAT IF SHE'S GUILTY?
how DIABOLICALLY CLEVER OF HER-- MAKE US DISMISS HER AS A SUSPECT
because SHE MADE HERSELF LOOK LIKE ONE.
or MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, SHE HAS A RARE AND PRECIOUS GIFT
and IS TRYING TO HELP US.
a RARE AND PRECIOUS GIFT.
tell ME... WHO GETS THESE GIFTS ANYHOW?
and HOW COME NO ONE EVER HAS THE GIFT
for SEEING HORSE RACE RESULTS?
and HOW COME DEAD PEOPLE ALWAYS TALK SUCH TEDIOUS DRIVEL?
play NICE. VAN PELT'S ENTITLED TO HER OPINION.
not IF IT'S WRONG. THIS IS LIKE BELIEVING IN THE EASTER BUNNY.
who SAYS THERE'S NO EASTER BUNNY?
van PELT. OH, HI.
Wow. THANKS.
got IT. WE'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
that WAS KRISTINA. SHE SAID SHE'S PICKING UP ON SOMETHING.
Ooh. SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HELP US.
why DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HER? I'M COMING.
does HE HAVE TO? IF SHE'S CONNING US, WE NEED TO KNOW.
she ISN'T. I CAN TELL. BEHAVE.
miss FRYE?
be RIGHT THERE. TAKE A SEAT, PLEASE.
Madame ZOLTAR WELCOMES YOU.
Mm. I SMELL DEAD PEOPLE.
Jane, SHH.
look, YOU CAN DO ALL YOUR HOLIDAY SHOPPING RIGHT HERE.
aren't YOU THE LEAST BIT INTERESTED IN WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY?
no. I LOVE THE MIRROR, THOUGH. CONVENIENTLY LOCATED, ISN'T IT?
what DO YOU MEAN? IT'S 1-WAY GLASS-- TEXTBOOK CLAIRVOYANT TRICK.
she STUDIES HER CLIENT'S BODY LANGUAGE BEFORE THEY COME IN.
come ON. SHE'S PROBABLY WATCHING US RIGHT NOW.
you CAN'T GO IN THERE. SURE, I CAN.
see? OH, MAYBE IN THIS INSTANCE,
but NOT AS A GENERAL OBSERVATION.
shall WE SIT DOWN?
sure.
you KNOW WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH?
enlighten ME.
you TALK SUCH A GOOD HIGH-CLASS GAME,
but YOUR TEMPLE
looks LIKE A DISCOUNT SOUVENIR STORE IN SHANGRI-LA.
well, CERTAIN IMAGERY GOES WITH THE TEITORY.
you KNOW THAT.
people EXPECT A LITTLE RAZZMATAZZ,
like THE SHINY SUITS YOU USED TO WEAR.
he SAYS...
I'm SORRY FOR ALL THE PAIN I CAUSED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER.
they're TEARS OF JOY.
so YOU HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON ME. I HAVE NOW.
red JOHN MURDERED YOUR famliy. I'M VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.
is THAT WHY YOU GAVE UP YOUR CALLING? CALLING? IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
Yeah, CALLING, GIFT, AS YOU LIKE.
there's NO DOUBT THAT YOU HAD THAT. WHY'D YOU GIVE IT UP? IT WAS THE SUITS. CHAFING. HORRIBLE.
always DANCING. WHY IS THAT? DON'T TRY TO COLD READ ME.
Oh, I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW. WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S A LIE.
can WE, UM, TALK ABOUT THE CASE?
Yes.
please.
so HAS ROSEMARY CONTACTED YOU YET?
no, NOT YET.
it OFTEN TAKES SOME TIME FOR SOULS TO MAKE A FULL TRANSIT.
Yes, THE CELESTIAL BUS IS RUNNING LATE.
I CALLED TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE.
clearly YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.
wait. I'M THE AGENT HERE.
we ARE INTERESTED.
I HAD A VISION ABOUT THE CAR USED TO KILL ROSEMARY.
water RUSHING INTO THE WINDOWS, TIRES UNDERWATER,
resting ON CONCRETE.
concrete? LIKE A SWIMMING POOL?
um, BIGGER.
a RESERVOIR MAYBE.
there's FOUNDERS LAKE JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.
Yes, A RESERVOIR.
Thanks.
the DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END IS CONSISTENT WITH A VEHICLE VERSUS PEDESTRIAN COLLISION.
but GET THIS-- THE V. I.N. NUMBER
matches ROSEMARY TENNANT'S OWN REGISTRATION. THAT'S HER CAR?
Yeah, TWO MOVING VIOLATIONS
show THAT TRAVIS USED THE VEHICLE ALL THE TIME. IT COULD HAVE BEEN JEREMY. HE HAD ACCESS TO IT AS WELL.
uh, PUT ONE OF THEM IN THE CAR THAT NIGHT
traffic CAMERAS, WITNESSES AT GAS STATIONS.
if IT EXISTS, I WANT TO KNOW. I'M ON IT.
are YOU GUYS GONNA ARREST TRAVIS TENNANT
or, UH, YOU WANT US TO? I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE,
but EVERYTHING WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.
well, I GO WITH MY GUT, UH, 90% OF THE TIME.
if IT FEELS RIGHT, IT'S MEANT TO BE. WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER 10%?
if ANYONE NEEDS ARRESTING, IT'S KRISTINA FRYE.
she KNEW THAT ROSEMARY WAS IN DANGER.
she KNEW WHERE TO FIND THE CAR, THE MURDER WEAPON,
which MEANS THAT SHE EITHER DOES HAVE SUPERNATURAL POWERS
or SHE WAS INVOLVED IN THE CRIME.
come ON. SHE SIMPLY DID WHAT YOU DO SO WELL.
with AN AIR OF CONFIDENCE, SHE MADE AN EDUCATED GUESS.
where ELSE WOULD YOU DUMP A CAR AROUND HERE?
she's A GOOD GUESSER.
well, I GUESS THAT'S A POSSIBILITY, TOO.
Yes, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU OBJECT TO, ISN'T IT?
not THAT SHE'S A CON ARTIST BUT THAT SHE'S SO GOOD AT IT.
maybe EVEN BETTER THAN YOU.
not AT ALL. I...
all RIGHT, YES.
not BETTER THAN ME, MIND YOU, BUT SHE IS GOOD,
and IT'S THE GOOD ONES THAT AREHE MOST DANGEROUS.
excuse ME, BUT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
that SHE'S ACTUALLY HONESTLY IN TOUCH WITH SOMETHING BEYOND YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
that WOULD BE GOLF AND MUSICAL THEATER OF THE '30s AND '40s.
the CAR IS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR THESE IN THE TRUNK.
high-grade COATED NYLON.
just LIKE THEY USE IN A PHOTO LAB.
Jeremy's GONE.
we HAD AN EXCHANGE, AND I TOLD HIM NOT TO COME BACK
and SOME OF MOM'S JEWELRY IS MISSING. YOU REALLY THINK HE DID IT?
and SOMEONE STOLE YOUR MOM'S CAR AND USED IT TO KILL HER.
but THE LOCKS WEREN'T JIMMIED. THEY HAD A KEY.
and YOU THINK I DID IT. LOOK, I ALREADY TOLD YOU WHERE I WAS.
go OUT, TALK TO MY FRIENDS. WE DID. THEY SAID THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE PARTY THAT NIGHT. YOU COULD HAVE LT AND COME BACK.
this IS SO UNFAIR. HOW...
my BROTHER'S RIGHT. JEREMY JUST LEFT.
clearly HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.
stay HERE.
Rigsby, IT'S ME. I NEED AN A. P.B. ON JEREMY HALE.
check THE AIRPORTS.
he's PROBABLY GOT AT LEAST TWO HOURS ON US.
he HASN'T GONE THAT FAR. HE'S NOT ON A PLANE.
how DO YOU KNOW? HE LEFT TOO MUCH BEHIND.
in A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, FIVE ARE OF ROSEMARY.
the REST ARE DATED AT LEAST A YEAR AGO.
except...
this ONE.
this WAS TAKEN A FEW WEEKS AGO. BRAND-NEW.
a LITTLE DAMAGED, BUT SOMEWHAT INTIMATE.
a WOMAN'S HEEL WOULD MAKE A HOLE LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T IT? YES.
being ROSEMARY'S HOUSE, WE CAN ASSUME IT'S ROSEMARY'S HEEL.
I'm STILL WITH YOU.
why WOULD ROSEMARY WANT TO PUT HER HEEL
in THIS NICE YOUNG WOMAN'S PICTURE,
that WAS TAKEN BY HER womanizing BOYFRIEND JEREMY?
know HER?
Yeah. THAT'S, UM, CONNIE ADAMS,
my MOM'S BRIDGE PARTNER'S DAUGHTER, CONNIE.
hello.
can I HELP YOU?
nice NECKLACE. POLICE.
we're LOOKING FOR JEREMY HALE. IS HE HERE?
baby?
Hi, JEREMY.
Hey.
let's GO TALK. YOU MIGHT WANT SOME CLOTHES.
or A LOT MORE WHIPPED CREAM. YOUR CALL.
rosemary WAS KILLED BY SOMEBODY DRIVING ONE OF HER OWN CARS.
okay.
a SILVER CHRYSLER. YOU EVER DRIVE THIS CAR, JEREMY?
no. THAT'S THE CAR THAT TRAVIS DROVE.
not MY STYLE. THING IS, WE FOUND A GLOVE IN THE CAR
that's FROM YOUR PHOTO LAB.
what ARE THE CHANCES WE FIND YOUR D. N.A. ON IT?
well, TRAVIS COULD HAVE TAKEN THOSE. TRAVIS HAS AN ALIBI.
you COULD HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN ORDER TO THROW SUSPICION ON HIM.
I COULD HAVE, I SUPPOSE, BUT I DIDN'T. YOU LEFT THE TENNANT HOUSE FAST,
almost LIKE YOU WERE RUNNING AWAY.
why IS THAT? I GOT INTO IT WITH THE KIDS.
that CLARA IS INSANE. I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA ASSAULT ME.
they THINK YOU KILLED THEIR MOTHER. WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
I LOVED HER. OF COURSE YOU DID. THAT'S WHY YOU GAVE ROSEMARY'S NECKLACE TO YOUR HOT NEW GIRLFRIEND.
well, IT'S NO GOOD TO ROSEMARY, IS IT?
so SHOOT ME. I'M A PRAGMATIST.
that's A GOOD WORD.
Miami, NEW YORK, CHICAGO
all WIDOWS, AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS TO YOUR BUDDING CAREER.
and ALL ALIVE AND WELL AND STILL GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE,
if YOU CARE TO SPEAK TO ANY OF THEM.
well, PHOEBE MIGHT BE A LITTLE AMBIVALENT ABOUT ME,
but... THE OTHERS ARE, YOU KNOW...
do YOU KNOW KRISTINA FRYE?
uh... THAT NAME IS FAMILIAR, BUT NO.
I DON'T THINK SO. SHE'S ROSEMARY'S PSYCHIC,
and I THINK YOU HAVE MET KRISTINA.
you TO HER PHOTOGRAPH. JANE TELLS US ONE OF YOUR PORTRAITS IS HANGING IN HER FOYER. WELL, I-I TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES.
two BENEFICIARIES ON THE SAME WILL,
both INTIMATE FRIENDS OF ROSEMARY'S,
yet THE TWO OF YOU HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY MET.
what ARE THE CHANCES?
I WANT A LAWYER.
Hey, BOSS, CHECK THIS OUT.
info ON KRISTINA FRYE.
in THE LAST TEN YEARS, EACH OF THESE PEOPLE
left HER NAME IN THEIR WILLS,
paydays RANGING FROM $10, 000 TO $200, 000.
maybe THE PSYCHIC AND JEREMY HAD A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
fleecing VULNERABLE WOMEN. SO MAYBE JANE WAS RIGHT.
it DOESN'T PROVE ANYTHING.
no, BUT IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START A CONVERSATION WITH FRYE.
Kristina, HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW JEREMY HALE?
he WAS ROSEMARY'S LOVER. UH, KIND OF A USER, I'D SAY,
but GENUINELY FOND OF HER, I THINK.
quite A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER. HE TOOK MY PICTURE.
did YOU KNOW HE WAS ALSO NAMED IN THE VICTIM'S WILL? IF THAT WAS ROSEMARY'S DECISION, FINE.
but WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? OVER THE LAST DECADE, FIVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE
have NAMED YOU IN THEIR WILLS. AGAINST MY EXPRESS WISHES.
I've HELPED HUNDREDS OF SICK CLIENTS
confront THEIR FEAR OF DYING,
and I ASSURE ALL OF THEM THAT I WILL TRY AND SPEAK TO THEM AFTER THEY'RE GONE,
but I HAVE NEVER ASKED ANY OF THEM FOR ANYTHING EVER.
then WHY DID JEREMY GET NERVOUS WHEN YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED?
probably BECAUSE WE HAD SEX ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS.
we HAD FUN. HE'S A GOOD TIME.
have YOU SPOKEN TO ROSEMARY T? YES, I HAVE.
Oh, YOU DID? WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SEEMS QUITE KEN WITH YOU.
Ah. SHE SAID YOU WERE A GOOD MAN
a DEEPLY MISGUIDED AND DAMAGED MAN,
but GOOD.
well, THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.
did SHE HAPPEN TO MENTION WHO KILLED HER? NO. SHE DIDN'T KNOW.
but SHE WANTS ME TO KEEP TRYING TO HELP YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN.
well, NOT THAT YOU MENTION IT, I'D LOVE TO HEAR
your CD RECORDINGS OF YOUR SESSIONS TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY.
and, UH, CAN YOU HAVE ROSEMARY APPEAR
at THE READING OF THE WILL? SHE'S A DEPARTED SOUL, NOT A WEDDING SINGER.
you CAN'T BOOK HER IN ADVANCE. AH, YEAH. I GUESS, UH, TIME DOESN'T MEAN MUCH
when YOU'RE DEAD FOREVER. NO SCHEDULE TO KEEP.
what's THE RUSH? RIGHT.
nice CRADLING.
you PLAY LACROSSE?
no.
fast-moving STICKS SCARE ME.
find OUT WHO DID IT YET?
not YET.
Hi.
Hi.
find ANYTHING?
I THINK KRISTINA FRYE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MOTHER'S DEATH.
to CONTACT YOUR MOM AT THE READING OF THE WILL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
how IS GETTING IN TOUCH WITH MY MOM
gonna HELP YOU THE KRISTINA? WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
she's NOT REALLY GONNA GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR MOM.
she's A FRAUD. I'M GOING TO EXPOSE HER. HOW DO YOU KNOW SHE WON'T REALLY PULL IT OFF?
well, SHE WON'T, BECAUSE SHE CAN'T.
I DON'T LIKE IT.
me NEITHER. WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? IT'S IMMORAL.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
say YOUR BRAIN GETS COOKED IF YOU USE THEM A LOT.
make YOU INFERTILE, TOO.
what ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
we WE LOOKING AT THE MICROWAVE.
uh, WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING THAT RAISING DEAD PEOPLE. YOU SAY THAT, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.
you're MOCKING THE OCCULT.
you DON'T HAVE ANY BELIEF IN THE AFTERLIFE.
you DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.
like KRISTINA USE TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE. BOO!
Yeah, LAUGH. GO AHEAD. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT KRISTINA'S A FAKE, ISN'T IT??
because IF SHE'S NOT-- IF SHE DOES HAVE A GIFT
everything YOU MOCK, EVERYTHING YOU DISCREDIT,
everything YOU STAND FOR GETS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.
um... YEAH. TRUE.
UNREALIY, BUT TRUE.
and WHAT IF YOUR FAMILY'S LOOKING DOWN AT YOU TONIGHT
but THEY CAN'T BECAUSE YOU WON'T BELIEVE?
well, THAT WOULD BE VERY SAD.
I'm SORRY.
no, THAT'S OKAY.
really, IT'S QUITE IRREGULAR.
it's WHAT MY MOTHER WANTED.
very W WELL.
if YOU CAN ALL PLEASE SIT DOWN?
at THE REQUEST OF ROSEMARY AND HEDAUGHTER CLARA,
the READING OF THE WILL SHALL BE PREFACED WITH A...
what DO YOU CALL IT?
good EVENING, EVERYBODY, AND WELCOME.
with YOUR HELP TONIGHT, I'M GONNA TRY AND CONTACT ROSEMARY.
will YOU ALL PLEASE HOLD HANDS WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR ON EITHER SIDE?
everybody?
good. THANK YOU.
thank YOU. WOULD YOU PLEASE TURN THE LIGHTS DOWN?
the VEIL WILL BE DRAWN BACK AND ROSEMARY WILL COME TO US,
as LONG AS WE BELIEVE.
as LONG AS WE BELIEVE.
everybody CONCENTRATE
on THE CANDLE IN THE CENTER OF THE TABLE.
look AT IT
and CONCENTRATE ON ROSEMARY.
come TO US, ROSEMARY.
come TO US.
speak.
it's ME, ROSEMARY.
I'm HERE, AS I PROMISED YOU I WOULD BE.
all YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE HERE, TOO, ROSEMARY.
is THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?
or ASK?
mom?
why, CLARA?
why DID YOU DO IT?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
what DO YOU MEAN?
this IS ALL A SCHEME THAT YOU AND KRISTINA COOKED UP, ISN'T IT?
well, IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE, BUT I'M NOT BUYING IT.
I'm NOT GONNA BUY IT. I'M NOT BUYING IT. I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
no.
no, I...
it's... I'M...
next CUE'S UP. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
got IT.
why, CLARA, WHY?
who's DOING THIS?
I'm SORRY, MOM.
I'm SO SORRY.
was IT YOU, CLARA?
were YOU IN THE CAR?
is THAT WHY SHE'S HERE?
is THAT WHAT'S CAUSED ALL THIS?
Yes.
Yes.
I GOT MAD.
I JUST GOT MAD.
Why?
she TOLD ME...
that SHE WAS GONNA CHANGE THE WILL AGAIN
to DISINHERIT TRAVIS.
she SAID THAT IT WAS FOR HIS OWN GOOD.
and SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.
we SAID SOME HARSH THINGS TO EACH OTHER.
so I RODE THE TRAIN DOWN FROM CLEAR LAKE
to SPEAK TO HER IN PERSON,
make HER...
see THINGS RATIONALLY.
I KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SEE HER DAMN PSYCHIC.
and...
I DIDN'T WANT TO RUN INTO THAT CREEP JEREMY,
so I WENT TO THE HOUSE
to GO PICK UP ONE OF THE CARS TO MEET HER.
I SAW HER AFTER SHE LEFT KRISTINA'S,
and I CALLED HER
so THAT SHE WOULDN'T BE FREAKED OUT
that I WOULD TURN UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
and SHE DIDN'T PICK UP THE PHONE
for HER OWN DAUGHTER, AND...
I JUST GOT MAD.
thank YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY, CLARA.
how DID YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS ME?
uh, WELL, UH...
it DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME UNTIL LATER
when YOU STARTED TRYING TO PIN THE BLAME ON JEREMY.
but WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN HERE, YOU EXPRESSED GREAT HORROR
that YOUR MOTHER HAD DIED IN THE GUTTER
not IN THE ROAD, NOT IN THE SIDEWALK, BUT THE GUTTER.
for HER TO DIE IN THE GUTTER LIKE THAT, IT'S...
like GARBAGE, IT'S--IT'S HORRIBLE.
and HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE DIED IN THE GUTTER
unless... YOU'D BEEN THERE?
I DID IT FOR TRAVIS.
and FOR YOURSELF.

how terrible for the earth and the sea!
the devil has come down to you, and he is filled wlth rage, as he knows that he has such llttle tlme left.
another HEAVEN
watch your step.
nice smelI.
maybe stew.
did the IandIord inform us?
Yeah. He was Iaughing.
what? Laughing?
when shocked, guys act in an odd way.
this place is new.
but no one wiIl rent it after this.
if TV reports this place, it'Il be finished.
the body seems fairly clean.
he's new.
nice smeIl, eh? Stew?
evidently the victim's a good cook.
lt's a cIue.
may I take a Iook?
Pork-no-chicken stew.
sure smelIs good.
how nice!
makes me hungry.
behave. There's a stiff here.
inspector Tobitaka and Dr. Akagi are coming.
oid Akagi too?
let's light it.
be carefuI.
pIease!
sorr y.
look.
his head's empty.
an insuIt to the dead!
lt's reaIIy empty.
what?
he has no brains.
then...
where are they?
the brains.
Hey, hey!
is it that terribIe?
what's with you?
Manabu!
what's this nice smelI?
AwfuI!
let's go.
what's with him?
the worst case I ever saw was a severed penis in the corpse's mouth.
how base!
I remember seeing a simiIar neck injury.
a zoo breeder was kiIIed by a goriIIa 20 years ago.
then a gorilla did that too.
a gorilIa chef.
a gourmet too.
how can you taIk Iike that?
ass! I'm shocked, too.
I doubt it.
inspector!
there's a tubious man.
say "" dubious. "
he Iives nextdoor.
can't make it out. Speak clearIy!
sorry.
it tastes Iike cheese.
he ran!
Hey, wait!
to the rear!
let go of me!
I didn't do it.
who said you did?
knock it off!
you said the kiIler was strong and a good cook.
you're trying to pin it on me, huh?
you're nice and strong.
does it matter?
lt sure does.
what do you do?
a butcher. So what?
butcher, eh?
I sIice meat and seII it. l cook stew to seIl, too.
my stew is tasty, they say.
anyway, what's it to you, huh?
he did it.
dear!
Hey, stop!
this ls where the murder occurred.
judging from the victim's injury, the kiIIer was a man weighing over 100 kg.
he had a grip of over 150 kg.
don't mention his cooking.
we'II get started.
bizarre Murder Cases
not bizarre crimes.
the guy killed his victims instantIy.
the butcher's innocent.
know why the neighbor was kiIled?
he rushed in when the kiIIer was cooking.
he broke his neck and threw him out.
he got mad?
he's sadistic and Ioses his temper easiIy.
why so sure?
a woman in the room.
he' d been sent to paradise once.
he arranged flowers too.
he had Iots of caII girl fliers, but...
who's she?
Dr. Sasamoto at the police hospital.
she was watching Manabu.
not a calI girl.
he had porno videos. He hid them from her.
I don't think he had a woman... unlike you.
who do you mean?
a cabaret hostess.
that? Name was Asako.
smaII fingerprints.
the killer was big.
so, the kiIler was a beauty.
smali hands, but she weighs over 100 kg.
is that it?
nonsense. The kiIler was a man.
inspector!
inspector!
another murder! Another empty head!
stew again?
no.
meat loaf?
spaghetti sauce.
let's go!
heII! My favorite food!
the fingerprints.
We'Il probabIy get more stiffs like this.
inedible food too.
another victim was diiscovered.
the total number ls...
five now.
how long must lt go on?
TV shows too much brutality.
lt invites crime.
too much violence appears in novels and movies.
as children grow, such scenes become ingrained.
they must be outlawed.
was I dreaming?
had a nightmare?
I was watching you.
how did you get in?
the door was open.
what a careIess cop!
the murder cases?
get out.
your case was cIosed.
why must we meet?
he was cooking?
then ""she. " Not ""he. "
don't Iook.
why beIieve the kiIIer's a man?
no man can be such a good cook.
some men can.
they're good cooks.
onIy girls learn cooking of this sort.
she must be a beauty.
she can hook a man easily. She arranges fIowers too.
a woman can't break a man's neck.
it's hard for a man, too.
how did she do it?
it's simpIe.
what?
her superhuman power.
lt's possible.
I thought about it, too.
you're Iying.
it fits in perfectIy.
she had sex.
but someone used physic power.
with human hands.
he needed too much strength for a woman.
not superhuman power.
is that so?
you think so, Manabu?
don't " Manabu " me.
now, get out.
l have special ability.
like what?
a keen sense. I can teIl how peopIe feeI.
nonsense!
how you feel, too.
leave.
you came to my place, too.
to investigate.
after I busted your man...
he wasn't my man.
only to investigate?
after that, I met you five times in town...
that didn't start anything like ""Iove. "
l have work to do.
I'm tired, too.
leave, huh?
aII right.
my bag.
I'm sure it was a woman.
Manabu?
you're reaIly tired.
poor guy!
Hey.
stop it.
let's do it.
aII right, eh?
I love you.
a voIuntar y teacher for the handicapped?
he's the seventh victim. Found in...
a vinegared stew?
his parents were killed in an accident.
he got their money and started voIunteering?
he was unfortunate.
he wanted to help people from their misery.
you want to do the same?
no.
did you suffer misfortune?
my parents' divorce.
it took me Iong to overcome it.
divorce makes chiIdren Ioose and lascivious.
you mustn't say that.
why not?
what about you?
ass!
what's that red stuff?
how couId you do that?
what a shame!
a UFO room, eh?
UFOs exist.
seen one?
think Earth's a gIobe?
of course!
seen it?
TV and photos. Even babies know.
I saw UFOs on TV and in photos.
Manabu.
you're a cop, eh?
so what?
cops mustn't believe in UFOs. Wake up!
sorr y. My teacher told me to come.
that's alI right. Come out.
Chi-chan stayed here for three days.
she wanted to do naughty things with him.
he didn't want to.
but one day Chi-chan got on him by force.
after that, she cut open his head Iike this.
she cut it open. I was scared!
he wasn't thinking anything bad.
he wasn't tasty. She said so.
teII his school.
did he see it?
don't ask me!
sir!
where are you?
why run away?
where are you?
sir?
where are you going?
sir!
wait, sir!
don't run!
No! No!
missing people get mixed up in crime.
they aren't felons.
I know.
believe in UFOs and ghosts? Enough!
why deny what reaIIy happened?
we can't beIieve in everything.
we can't ask ghost for help.
how muIish!
in the first place, how couId a woman rape a man?
found her?
here!
Chizuru Kashiwagi, a coIlege student.
she became missing three days before the first case.
she's "Chi-chan. "
she's weird.
she okay?
be patient.
I'm sure we can do anything to her.
it's for sure. What'II we do?
don't force yourself to drink.
sorry.
no butter.
don't I have any?
what about salad oiI?
no.
I'II go buy some.
no. I'II go.
don't bother. I'II go myseIf.
excuse me.
hurry.
What're you cooking?
something delicious. I need more ingredients.
sIice the fish yourseIf?
the fish are Iucky.
sorry.
be patient.
Hey, Chizuru...
don't move so fast.
I can hear.
hear what?
your bad thoughts.
it's fun to open a head.
bad thoughts change brains' coIor.
and...
it's refIected in hair, too.
l reaIized it only Iately.
your hair's stiff.
I don't Iike this.
I bought butter.
WelI?
where are they?
they're resting.
resting?
Hey, wait a minute.
what?
I'II use a rubber.
it's for your sake, too.
why must everyone provoke me?
afraid of disease?
no.
about disease...
only the living need to worry.
heIp!
heIp!
five on the baIcony, four on the veranda.
seven at the fire escape.
one in the basement car park.
two in every corridor. Okay?
we're ready.
let's go.
he says a Chizuru did it.
the informer? Who can telI?
this way.
it's open.
over there too!
caIl an ambulance!
no brains.
lt's empty.
cooI down!
Where's the kiIIer?
cool down first.
let's look for the kilIer and more victims.
coId... coId...
you okay?
be brave!
a bIanket!
poIice. You're alI right.
your name?
Kimura... it's Kimura.
you're aII right.
the gal's dead.
there was no one else here.
Meaning?
the kilIer was...
Chizuru.
you said she couIdn't be.
I realize she was!
her brains are gone.
how couId she kiII?
at least her heart was beating.
a bIanket.
a colIege student kiIIed a man and cooked his brains.
and her brains got Iost, too.
unbeIievabIe!
saying there's another kiIIer? Where's he?
teII me!
noisy kid!
what's up?
what is it?
lovely hair...
college STUDENT SUSPECTED OF MURDER
going out?
you like me?
why ask?
just telI me.
your face.
stay in bed.
what's up?
aII you see is...
how l Iook.
l want you to be as you look. It's obvious.
what about you?
what?
what do you like...
I don't know.
you asked me first.
let's go.
together? Where to?
just get up.
what happened here?
Chizuru became missing.
she' d been with a friend.
she was standing there.
three days Iater, the murders began.
she was studying cooking and fIower arrangement.
she had thin wrists.
she broke men's necks?
her brains were gone, too.
yet, the poIice...
tried to decide she was the kiIler.
they believe only what they can see.
the kilIer ran.
ran?
not Chizuru.
something evil ran from her head.
she's a good girI.
she was so obedient that she grew frustrated.
she was under stress.
so eviI attracted her.
frustrated?
it's just a Iump of stone.
I detest enduring things.
her father wants her back.
her brains weren't gone.
they shrank and dried up in a corner.
fiIIed with uicers, too.
brain uicers?
how could she live until now?
how could she waIk?
I want to keep such a rarity here.
she was ilI?
how could she have kiIled?
but she really did it.
there's physicaI evidence.
she wasn't a big man.
her potentiaIity.
a mother lifts a car to save her kid.
that's absurd!
that doesn't matter.
two guys were aImost kiIIed by Chizuru.
she was arrested and died.
case cIosed. lt's over.
let me say this again...
no thanks.
without brains, how couId she think?
yet she did. That's a fact.
stilI arguing?
Mr. Hayase.
a phone caIl for you.
HeIIo?
Manabu?
who is this?
HeIIo?
Chlzuru was standing before that statue, eh?
you Kimura?
how did you know?
think. You'll know the answer.
answer! How did you know?
l have a gift for you.
a gift?
room 1009, Hotel Excellent.
my gift for you.
Kimura! Hey!
a crime buff.
he tapped into our radio.
guys like that are around.
open it.
for Beloved Manabu "
brains did it!
look for the kiIler.
Chizuru's brains moved to Kimura.
so he did the same.
nonsense. Move!
HeIIo?
mysterious, eh?
why copy what Chizuru did?
l knew you' d say so. Stupld!
shut up! Damn you!
there!
Manabu.
stairs.
Freeze!
don't move!
you ass!
who's the woman?
l don't know. I picked her up.
inspector!
I'm happy.
this worId's wonderful!
knock it off!
damn him!
Hey, Manabu!
I Iet myseIf drift in a current.
I wonder where I'Il end up.
Manabu.
I missed you.
don't " Manabu" me!
go ahead. Shoot, Manabu...
finalIy we meet again.
how terrific!
you Iook great.
damn you!
Freeze!
you can't shoot, eh?
shoot!
go ahead!
shoot!
I hit him.
let's go down!
where is he?
he must be dead.
he reaIly ran away!
teII them to shoot him.
just shoot him.
expIain first.
shut up!
him!
he's crazy!
the car!
what's he doing?
baiting us.
some guy!
don't overdo it, Pop.
shut up!
you got better at shooting.
just by chance.
shoot his groin. He kissed you.
I'II kilI him.
this is Hayase. I'm at the condominium...
is murder bad?
of course!
of course?
TV's filIed with murder.
murder takes place in dramas, movies and news.
everyone's bored. They crave fun.
life without murder's boring to you too, eh?
what are you?
what am I?
a spaceman?
spaceman, eh?
answer.
it's only today's humans that think of space wars.
drop bombs to protect us!
I'm human, a reaI human.
no kidding!
I'm not kidding. I'm a human.
l know...
that you can understand me.
no humans have your power.
we're friends.
let's pIay together.
I'm not gay.
then what do you like?
lay off him, Manabu!
no probIem.
bruises and three cracked ribs.
it's not a problem?
just Iie stiII. Your brains are aII right, too.
lie stilI?
for a week, at Ieast.
a problem.
Why? The case is aImost cIosed, right?
the kilIer's seriously wounded?
that inspector shot an unarmed man three times.
I shot him, too.
he wasn't armed, eh?
a spaceman...
I mean him.
I'II check your brains again.
do so.
I was joking.
there you are!
excuse me.
leave!
what?
excuse me.
you stay. She's Ieaving.
I came just now.
I'II leave. Take care.
I'm not Ieaving.
why the sungIasses?
to be incognito.
you won't be.
I Iooked everywhere for you.
does it hurt?
Yeah.
I was in danger.
thought I' d die.
don't say that.
that reminds me. You were right.
the kiIler.
what was he?
I don't know.
he enters a human head.
said he was a human.
a human?
said I'm his friend.
a friend?
a friend.
he didn't mean to kiIl me.
what's ""friend " ?
I'm not heIping people.
Meaning...?
I'm just a crime buff.
a crime buff?
I Iistened to police radios and phones.
I rushed to the scene.
l was a student then.
everything was real.
reaI crimes were great.
I liked it.
the evil enchanted me.
so I became a cop.
I'm not heIping people.
he reaIized it.
I never mentioned it.
but...
but what?
you helped me once...
from bad peopIe.
I didn't mean to.
lt was my job.
that's aIl.
OK, well
I did not get the job in New York.
but I got the real prize...
domestic bliss.
jan made me breakfast this morning.
well, she bought the milk.
it's soy.
this is why I do it.
that's what I have to come home to.
she probably won't be up for a few hours.
this is going be a very good year.
very good.
jan is at home.
Jim is back.
good stuff.
Andy and Dwight are rocking the sales team.
I feel very blessed.
what was the exact offer?
it was for a... Video.
Yeah, well, what kd of video?
a celebrity sex tape.
Really? What kind of celebrity?
not relevant. - How much you pay for it?
not relevant. - you paid for it?
it all happened so fast.
I broke up with Karen after the job interview.
and, uh...
it was a little awkward when she came back from the city.
she told me very clearly that just because we were broken up didn't mean that she was going anywhere, because she had worked really hard for her career.
but the next day, her desk was empty.
and as for me and my current romantic life...
I, uh...
I'm single now and looking.
so if you know anybody...
Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York.
I talked him through his breakup.
it's really nice to be good friends again.
are you kidding me?
Pam and Jim are totally hooking up.
all they do is smile.
they're just keeping it a secret.
right?
I don't know.
there is no evidence of intimacy.
they've been in remarkably good moods.
could other things.
are you kidding me?
and Sunday,
I'm thinking of going to that flea market at the drive-in.
Oh, that sounds fun.
I'm mountain biking on Sunday in, uh...
montage Mountain.
cool. - yeah.
well, have fun with that.
ladies and gentlemen.
I have some bad news.
Meredith was hit by a car.
what? - where?
it happened this morning in the parking lot.
I took her to the hospital.
and the doctors tried to save her life.
they did the best that they could.
and she is going to be okay.
what is wrong with you?
why did you have to phrase it like that?
so she's really going to be fine?
Yes.
she has a slight...
Pelvical fracture.
but, uh, people have survived far worse.
thank god you were there.
Yeah.
did you see who did it?
Oh, no need. We can just check the security tapes.
Yeah, kind of a good news/bad news there.
I was able to be on the scene so quickly, because I was in the car that hit her.
who was driving?
Oh, Michael.
one day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway.
I wonder who he ran over then.
it's only Meredith.
Yeah, it's only Meredith. Thank god.
but did you see the way they looked at me?
like I was a murderer or something.
Hey.
why did you do it?
it was an accident.
was she talking back? - no.
just got sick of that face?
did she owe you money?
is this down sizing?
did she spurn your advances?
Hey, guys.
we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch.
and we're kicking in $5 for flowers.
who's we? you and Jim?
no, me and Stanley and Phyllis so far.
Oh. I bet Jim goes too.
Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.
Oh. I bet you ask.
I was planning on it.
I bet you were.
Angela? - Subtle.
what? - Are you coming?
I can't. Sprinkles is sick.
she's been sick for some time. thank you for asking.
no one asks about sprinkles.
I have to give her her meds, I have to pet her.
and who will she eat lunch with?
can't your other cats keep her company?
there's bad blood.
jealousies, cliques. - Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee.
I shouldn't even be planning this.
it's your job.
all right!
my lord, my liege. - Yes, Michael?
so Ryan got promoted to corporate where he is a little fish in a big pond.
whereas back here in Scranton,
I am still top dog in a fairly large pond.
so who's the real boss?
the dog or a fish?
so I need a little treat for the gang.
something to win their affections back.
back?
why is that, Michael?
well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Oh!
did you do this on purpose?
no, I was being negligent.
but she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely.
tiny little crack in her pelvis.
but she will be... - Did this happen on company property?
Yes.
it was on company property with company property.
so double jeopardy. we are fine.
I don't... I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
Oh, right, I'm sorry.
what is "we're fine"?
people keep calling me a "wunderkind."
I don't even know what that means.
I mean, I know what it means.
it means very successful for your age.
so I guess it makes sense, but...
it's a weird word.
Hey, D.
hey monkey, what's up?
can you do me a little favor?
go to my place at lunch and give Sprinkles her medicine?
sure.
I have to visit the alkie.
check to see if she's faking.
if a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis.
you know what?
I bet she cracked it at home.
jumped in front of the car to get some worker's comp.
I wouldn't put it past her.
so what do you need me to do?
I wrote it out.
there's a diabetes shot.
roll the insulin in your hands, don't shake it.
she gets an ace inhibitor with her meal.
but you have to put her right in front of the dish, or she won't see it because of the cataracts.
mix one capsule of omega fatty acid in with her kidney medicine.
and you wanna give that to her 15 minutes after she's eaten.
and, oh... There's a fungal cream, because she has this infection under her tail.
so you're gonna have to lift her tail and put the cream right at the base of her tail.
okay, I have an announcement.
you pushed Darryl out the window? - No.
you shot Dwight? - no. No, that is not funny. I love my employees.
even though I hit one of you with my car.
for which I take full responsibility.
look, I am just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy and on to more positive things.
so I thought we should plant a tree.
Oh, good. That means we don't have to work.
okay, we're leaving for the hospital at 1: 00.
so, like, a freedom tree.
I can take three people.
I can also take three people.
separate cars. - Pam?
all right, we'll get a card at the hospital, and we'll sign it outside her room.
sales people can go later in the day.
hourly workers can go at lunch.
okay, good, good.
so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
excellent. - I- I was inking that...
good work, Pam.
but if you...
Yaaaay, Pam!
all right, since I'm the boss, I will drive as well.
who wants shgun?
you can't be serious.
you ran a woman over this morning.
everybody inside the car was fine, Stanley!
guess what? I have flaws.
what are they?
Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower.
sometimes I spend too much time volunteering.
occasionally, I'll hit somebody with my car.
so sue me.
no, don't sue me.
that's the opposite of the point that I am trying to make.
I hate hospitals.
in my mind, they are associated with sickness.
Oh...
she looks like an angel.
she looks awful.
no... Okay.
she always looks like that it was not my fault.
I think she's awake.
no.
she's in a coma.
no.
okay.
I brought all your friends from the office, dear.
at the same time. - yep.
Hello, Meredith.
this is weird.
brought you some balloons.
why don't we...here you go.
tie these up, cheer up your tubes.
Oh, for god's sake.
nurse!
no, don't bother the nurse. Just put it back in.
I am going to be sick.
I am going to puke. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't worry about it. don't touch it.
what are you doing? - just gimme that thanks.
does it hurt terribly?
no, it's not too bad.
they have me on a lot of painkillers.
Oh, really? what kind? Codeine?
vicodin? Percocet?
fentanyl? Oxycontin?
Palladone? what? - I have no idea.
well, it was really great of all of you to come and visit me at the same time.
I'll see you guys at the office.
okay, wait up, wait up, guys. Guys, guys, hold on a sec.
you know what I was thinking might be sort of fun?
is if you forgave me... in front of everybody.
Michael, I'm not gonna do that.
cause you know what they say in the bible about forgiveness?
forgiveness...
is next to godliness.
no, that's not. that's cleanliness. - Well, just shh. just... Just...
you cracked my pelvis.
look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
you're not forgiven.
come on.
do I need to be liked? Absolutely not.
I like to be liked.
I enjoy being liked.
I have to be liked.
but it's not, like this compulsive need to be liked.
like my need to be praised.
Hey. - hey, monkey.
any problems?
well, you left the tv on.
and your cat is dead.
What?!
sparkles, the white one, is dead.
that was the sick one, right?
but I thought she had more time.
no.
did she look...
when you saw her, how was she looking?
really dead.
like
like a, just a dead cat.
so... hey, come on.
don't be sad. just...
okay? just...
she's in a better place.
all right.
actually, the place that she's in is the freezer.
because of the odor.
it's gonna be okay.
okay, you know what?
everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing.
she cracked her pelvis. A tiny, little crack.
and she's gonna be fine.
so let just...
Michael, Angela's cat died.
I'm sorry, Angela.
man, what a day, huh?
how could it get any worse?
her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then...
God!
that's three things.
I'll tell you what's going on.
this office is cursed.
and we need to do something about it.
I am taking responsibility.
and it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car.
I'm not superstitious, but...
I'm... I am a little superstitious.
we do anything involving an Indian burial ground?
like what?
like park on it.
or dig up a body.
do you have anything you wanna tell us?
no, I did not violate an Indian burial ground.
in fact, I had some good luck recently.
Alfredo's pizza picked my business card out of the basket, so I get a week of free pies.
that's cool. - Yeah.
perfect.
so our tragedy is our good luck.
Satan.
sprinkles never hurt a soul.
God, in your infinite wisdom, how can you do this?
she wasn't ready.
she had so much left to accomplish.
it is only a cat.
you never...
you don't like them.
Dwight, please.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
no, I have not.
well, I think you should go to the hospital and pay your respects.
I do not respect her.
but I will go.
all right.
I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Oh, Michael, you can ask about religious beliefs.
Satan is a master of lies.
everything he says is the opposite.
all right, well, then you can ask about religious beliefs.
thank you for the permission. psych!
all right, let's just go around the room, and... And tell me what you believe in.
um, catholic. - okay.
Presbyterian.
Oh, me too.
for real? - Same religion.
all right. - Cool.
uh, I'm a Lutheran, and Bob is a Unitarian.
it keeps things spicy.
that's why we're cursed.
I've been involved in a number of cults, both as a leader and a follower.
you have more fun as a follower.
but you make more money as a leader.
Kelly, you are Hindu.
so you believe in Buddha.
that's Buddhists.
are you sure?
no.
what are you?
uh, well, if you're gonna reduce my identity to my religion, then I'm Sikh.
but I also like hip-hop and NPR.
and I'm restoring a 1967 corvette in my spare time.
okay.
so one Sikh, and...
as a farmer,
I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery.
with the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive, we could power a small fan for two days.
you tell me what's unethical.
blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
don't pull any plugs.
how are you doing, Miss Palmer?
better. Excellent.
are you a doctor or a male nurse?
um, I'm an intern, which makes me a doctor.
her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy, but she did, or at least, she got time off for one.
so that is where her uterus went.
miss Palmer, your last tetanus shot was when you were bitten by a bat a few months ago?
Yes.
just doing my job.
it also says you were recently bitten by a raccoon?
and a rat.
separate occasions.
spend your whole le trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car.
and it's not even one of the popular ones.
everybody gets on your case.
doesn't make any sense.
God is dead.
if there was a god, then Ryan and I would be married by now.
maybe believing in god was a mistake.
what did people believe in before?
the sun?
maybe there's some sort of animal that we could make a sacrifice to.
like.
a giant buffalo.
or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion.
or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat.
or just...
the head of a monkey with...
the antlers of a reindeer.
with the body of...
a porcupine.
I will do some research.
okay. - I can help you with that.
so just to be safe, they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
God, rabies?
I was in the hospital room with her.
how contagious is that? is that like an STD?
no, no. You gotta be bitten by something.
this place is so cursed.
actually, the doctor said it was lucky she came in the hospital, 'cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in.
lockjaw.
I know a lot of you are very upset with me
but it may make you feel a little bit better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life by putting a garbage bag over her head and it had a bat in it.
six of one, really.
turns out, Meredith has been exposed to rabies.
thanks to me, she went to the hospital, and that saved her life.
curse is broken.
curse is broken, people!
Oh, there is a god!
and he has a plan for us after all.
so go home, get some rest.
very, very good work today.
got a lot accomplished.
is there a god?
if not, what are all these churches for?
and who is Jesus' dad?
Oh, well.
if they aren't together now, then they probably never will be.
I thought they'd be good together.
like PB &J.
Pam Beesly and Jim.
what a waste.
what a waste.
I told you I'm not dating anyone.
and even if I was,
I don't think it's anyone's business.
I mean, when I do fall in love, like, when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it to is a camera crew or my coworkers.
almost marrying Roy Anderson was as close to Pamela Anderson as I ever wanna be.
trust me, when I fall in love, you'll know.
michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer memorial celebrity rabies awareness fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.
pro-am.
pro-am race for the...
they hung up. - okay a woman shouldn't have to be hit by a car to learn that she may have rabies.
but that is where we are in America.
and that does not sit right with me.
and that is why I am hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies...
to raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies.
a disease that has been largely eradicated in the U. S.
but not very many people know that.
no, rabies.
babies would be a good idea.
can I put you down for a dime?
Hi, Stankley, how many sponsors so far?
zero.
come on, man.
you gotta step it up.
it's for a good cause.
jan called this morning and pledged $500.
isn't that your money?
that is for a good cause.
Phyllis, how is the rabies quilt coming?
Oh, it's coming.
Oh, look at that!
three way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
Michael? - Yes?
you cannot make me run. - Okay.
it is not a real charity.
it's stupid, Michael.
and I'm not gonna do it. - All right.
you didn't run for me when I thought I had skin cancer.
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
no.
okay.
well, back in olden times, a large, fat person like this was a person of power.
a person who had money, who could buy food.
a person of respect, like the regional manager of the day.
whereas someone athletic and trim like myself was somebody who worked in the fields, and I was a peasant.
I just don't wanna run.
I didn't bring my sneakers or my clothes.
well, you're going to have to run or you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
it is not old times anymore.
I'm petrified of nipple chafing.
once it starts, is a vicious circle.
you have sensitive nipples, they chafe.
so they become more sensitive.
so they chafe more.
so...
I take precautions. Hey, Angela.
Hey, um...
I'm sorry about your cat.
this is Sprinkles.
she was my best friend.
I kept her going through countless ailments.
I asked Dwight Schrute to feed her once, and she is now deceased.
this is Halloween last year.
just a couple of kittens out on the town.
I'm having relationship problems.
and since you're always having relationship problems,
I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
what's wrong?
I have this crazy thought that I know is crazy.
that maybe Dwight killed my cat.
when I got home, Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her.
but all my bags of frozen French Fries had been clawed to shreds!
Oh.
something's not right.
the vet's doing an autopsy.
Angela, I'm sorry.
did Roy ever kill one of your cats?
I'm more of a dog person.
so what's your strategy for this race?
well, I'm gonna start fast.
then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.
what? - Then'm gonna end fast.
why won't more people do that?
cause they're stupid.
what?
Oh, um, no, that's not...
I mean, that wasn't...
Yeah, that was, um...
I mean, I can see how it would seem a bit like we, uh...
how it looks like, um...
but, I mean, nowadays, you can edit anything, right?
I mean, you can edit anything to...
look like, um, anything.
so. Yeah, I gave him a ride home.
because... right.
we're dating.
Wow.
there it is.
uh, yeah.
we haven't told anybody.
but it's going really great.
right?
it is going really great
shut up.
you're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Oh, really?
you'll feel better after the 5k.
exercise is good for depression.
I am not depressed.
I'm in grief!
we have raised almost $700, most of it from me and Jan.
um... When do they put that on the giant check?
or is that something that we write in lat?
well, a giant check costs about $200 to make up.
I have a print shop standing by, but...
what do you think, Michael?
that's over 25% of our funds.
it's... A tough decision.
um...
I always imagined it with a giant check.
Yeah, I mean, I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
giant check it is.
well, I don't know.
on the other hand, it does leave less money for bat birth control.
bat birth control.
wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right, Michael?
that's what you told me when I contributed.
you don't contribute very much.
I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor.
how's that going?
not well.
a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700 or $500 if we go with the giant check.
which we are.
and also...
there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
how about a rabies nurse?
I don't think so. you know what, though?
I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour.
for, uh, parties and bachelor events.
that's possible. Look into that.
great. It's gonna cost a couple hundred bucks.
and, uh... oh, actually, more...
with tips.
maybe we should skip the ceremony and just set up a college fund for Meredith's son.
have you met that kid?
not going to college.
5K means five kilometers, not 5, 000 miles.
come I hey. hey, hey!
Oh, my god! what are you doing?
what are you doing?!
you said, "come in!" No, I didn't. Just...
Oh, my god.
please, get out.
still burned in my eyes.
I can imagine.
come in.
may I enter the room?
Yes. or "come in."
see how I did that?
that's the way you should enter a room.
you knock and then you wait for the all clear.
you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room? Yes.
but I have an office, so why would I do that?
on average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office?
just ballpark.
european offices are naked all the time.
they're so not.
besides, my shirt tail covered most of it, so...
I didn't see where it started, but I saw where it ended.
phew, gross.
that's not gross! it is the human body.
what is your problem?
Pam, you're an artist, right?
think of me as one of your models.
okay, you know what?
I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today.
it's not fair to people with rabies.
and that's the point. right?
okay.
let's go have some fun all right.
they say if you're nervous around someone, you should picture them naked.
I do not recommend this strategy.
try picturing them with more clothes on.
or a funny coat.
Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office?
and not a French beach?
okay, name, ease?
you're over 75 years old?
82 November 1st.
how much is the prize money?
there's no prize money.
well, is any of this real?
check that out.
look at me, I'm Toby!
I'm stretching. I know what l'm doing.
so I heard that you were peeping on Michael.
what? no, it was not...
look, I don't know what your deal is, but he's mine, okay?
so hands off.
okay, everybody, listen up!
thank you for coming.
before we get started, I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies.
and I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.
that should scare you.
it scares me.
you people need to educate yourselves.
three Americans every year die from rabies.
four Americans every year die from rabies.
how many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies?
show of hands.
one, two, three... too many to count.
it is truly the silent killer.
no, it is the foaming, barking killer.
and it is something that... rryl!
what are you doing?
I'm giving him a peanut.
no, don't give him...
did you hear anything I said?
look how happy he is.
he's happy because he's insane.
you know what?
that's a perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
Where's the nurse?
this is the reason we're here.
Hello, Michael.
Oh, hey, I know you. Elizabeth, right? Yeah.
Wow.
very cool you went back and got your degree.
I would like you to accept this check for $340
made out to science.
make sure that that gets into the right hands.
right.
you got it?
Mm-hmm.
okay.
fettuccine Alfredo.
time to carbo load.
Mmm.
just remember, folks, it's not about winning.
it is about finishing.
on your marks!
get set!
down!
on your left!
wow, you're fast.
you're doing great, Michael. look at you go!
that's my boss!
Yeah, baby!
I'm fast. I'm very fast.
I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot oh, yes, I will work out today.
I will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.
I've walked two marathons.
pretty sure I can handle a 5k.
the key is drafting to eliminate wind resistance.
Oh, we're in last place.
Oh, would you look at that?
damn it.
water!
water.
Oh! water, babe?
no, no water for me.
not while rabies causes fear of water.
solidarity!
Michael, that's irrational!
rabies victims...
have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives.
so... Least I could do.
Oh, god. my nipples.
it's starting.
can we get another round?
okay. thanks so we've got what? another 20 minutes?
more or less. mmm.
that fettuccini...
is hitting my stomach like a rock.
you got nothing to worry about.
Excellent!
wait, imodium or ex-lax?
I'm making great time.
usually I have to take a bathroom break halfway through a race like this.
but... Not today.
Ooh, an estate sale.
want to go in?
I don't know, I'm really committed to winning.
okay, but what if I told you that all the money you spend here goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Mmm, yes.
that's what I thought.
Yeah. right?
let's do some good.
you have reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.
rabies awarness pro am fun run race...
for the cure.
leave a message.
Oh, god.
Oh, Alfredo sauce.
I'm getting a stitch. ahh!
Ow! god!
watch the nipples, Kevin!
back off me.
how you feeling? better?
no.
well, you look cute as button.
you've worked up quite a sweat.
the vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
I am a farmer, Angela.
what does that mean?
okay, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what it is folk don't have the stomach to do.
you did kill her!
I-I sang her the favorite songs.
you put her in my freezer!
it was beautiful and gentle and respectful.
I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
well, then she barfed them up in the freezer and tried to get out.
well, I'm not responsible that... Hey!
Ow! it's okay!
it's nothing! I'm robbing her!
it's nothing! it's fine!
how could you do that without telling me?
I thought I was helping you.
I expected a hug.
I took care of that cat the best way I knew how.
cat heaven is a beautiful place.
but you don't get there if you're euthanized.
I know a great taxidermist.
I'll pay to have her stuff.
well, he's not great, but he's pretty good.
you don't understand.
take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
or we can have her buried out at the east field by mother.
huh, Angela?
don't touch me, Dwight.
it's kind of designy and cool.
it was $8.
Oh, and I get to carry it.
and the winner is Toby Flenderson!
have a seat. I'll write it down.
where are we?
I don't know.
like five kilometers from the office.
he couldn't have made it circle?
I am not going to finish.
can't beat rabies.
nobody can beat rabies.
rabies has been around for a thousand years.
I was fool to think that I could beat it.
pictures of the dog all around.
Yeah, probably... hey.
what are you doing here?
did you come back for us of...
I can't finish.
I feel so weak. I just...
well, you're probably dehydrated.
what do you want me to do, Jim?
a glass of water would be a start.
no, there are people all over t world with all sorts of problems and afflictions and diseases.
they're deformed and they're abnormal.
and... they're illiterate and ugly.
symphonies don't have any money.
public tv is bust.
I can't do anything about it.
I can't, you know...
there's just one of me, and there's thousand of them.
and rabies wins.
wow, you are a downer.
we were having a pretty nice day.
I'm still having a nice day.
you are? yeah.
Hey, Michael, look at this lamp.
8
that's a good deal.
and Michael, you don't have rabies.
and chances are you're not gonna get it anytime soon.
so you don't really have to think about it too much.
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
Yeah, but there's other better people out there who are helping.
you just don't think I am capable of making a difference.
I know you, Michael.
I saw you naked.
you don't...
you don't know me.
you've just seen my penis.
I can make a difference remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car.
and I owe it to her to finish this g. D. 5k.
Oh!
no, no!
finishing that 5k was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
I ate more Fettuccine Alfredo and drank less water than I have in my entire life.
people always talk about triumphs of the human spirit.
well, today I had a triumph of the human body.
that's why everybody was applauding for me at the end.
my guts and my heart.
and while I eventually puked my guts out,
I never puked my heart out.
and I'm very, very proud of that.
Hey, Michael. Hey, Mer.
how you doing?
better.
it's ironic, isn't it?
I mean, I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water.
and you're in it for a disease that causes a fear of water.
I'm in because you hit me with your car.
Oh. but I want to say...
I heard you were trying really hard, so... I'm not mad at you anymore.
Thanks.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
want to share?
sure.
I'm not really sick.
I'm GOOD.
nothing. Give me 360.
clear.
I see life. - Who is he?
his name's Eli James.
he's a psychology professor with a therapy practice at the university.
so I take it you haven't seen any more ghosts?
safe assumption. - That's a lie.
you can't see them, but you can hear them.
so the good news is, I'm not dead.
the bad news is, I might have to spend the rest of my life listening to people who are and helping them.
help me! Please help me! I need you to help me!
I need to help me, why won't you listen?
I know you can hear...
the ghost chatter simmered down.
it doesn't sound like the floor of the new york stock exchange in my head anymore.
but there is this one little bugger who wakes me up every night by humming.
they pester you because they're scared and no one's listening.
usually, you try to help them if they can or learn to tune them out.
and our time is up for today.
wow, blunt, to the point.
now I know how my psych patients feel.
I have someone coming to perform cpr on my computer.
and by the way, antique silk.
my tech can fix anything.
Oh, and he's even early.
Oh, only because his friends are all hanging out at the arcade later.
Oh, it's working! You're my hero.
if I'd lost the inventory, your mom would have quit.
well, the files were all there. I just had to de-frag your hard drive.
please, watch your language, we have company.
cool, you're the guy that hears ghosts.
you're Delia's kid, the one that hears about ghosts.
it's wild how you all of a sudden got the gift.
Yeah, well, don't get too excited.
there was a catch. I had to die first.
but good job on the, uh - oh, sick!
alt world 2! Is this version 5. 0?
Yeah, it still has some kinks, but if you over-clock your rig, it kicks.
the arcade's amazing.
wait, this is not the arcade where your - me and my friends, yeah.
I'm online right now.
there's my avatar.
avatar?
what is that, some sort of ancient weapon?
no, it's me or, um, what I look like in the game.
um, an animated version of me.
it could like the actual game or be a complete fantasy.
you can pick hair, skin color, clothes.
you can be anyone, do anything.
Yeah, and that is why I keep a close eye.
see? There you are.
you just went virtual.
Yeah, but I would never wear my hair like that.
your avatar does.
so instead of going to an actual place to play games -- Ooh, could you make me taller?
there are games in here.
mostly it's a place where kids go to hang out in world.
and it's educational. I mean, you can meet people from around the world.
Ned, show her.
Oh, here come the campus crusaders, or...
are they girl scouts?
the fringe girls.
they're from the Halliwell Academy, private school.
in real life, they wear uniforms.
it's like through the looking glass.
nothing is ever what it seems.
what about the guy who's standing next to him?
I mean, why is he giving Ned's avatar the evil eye?
that's Phoenix.
he's always here, always with that same geek look.
Yeah, but, I mean, you guys see the way that he's looking at Ned.
not really.
he looks the same to me.
well, how about now? I mean, he's looking right at me.
Oh, come on!
what? - What's happening? He's not moving.
his gamer must have left his machine.
didn't log off.
who are you?
who are you?!
where am I?! - Who is that? What's happening?
OK, just - just try to calm down.
where is she?!
that can't be good. - That was a ghost, right?
who-- Who are you looking for?
I don't have control!
OK, that wasn't an avatar I just heard by any chance, was it?
Yes, Phoenix, or a ghost that looked just like him.
I swear it was nothing I did.
no, it was something I did.
I just drew a ghost out of my machine.
did that ghost just trash your store because he was angry about something?
I once had a patient in therapy who compulsively smashed animal figurines.
no, he was more confused than anything.
he said he wasn't in control.
like the real world's a new kind of game to him?
Oh, that's so trippy.
is any of this even possible?
I've seen ghosts interact with electronics before, but nothing like this.
what would make a ghost decide to go into a game?
why would he come out looking like his avatar?
sometimes spirits appear as they remember themselves, so if he died playing the game, maybe he thinks he's his own avatar.
didn't I hear him say,"where is she?" means he was looking for someone.
Phoenix hangs out mostly with one of the fringe girls.
OK, where do they hang?
I'll show you. Come on.
bookstore cafe.
free Internet and half-decent coffee.
he's here.
tell me about the girl he likes.
I don't know her name, but her avatar's name is Sedona.
looks like he just found her.
Hi, honey.
wait, point me in his direction. I'm dying to ask him some questions.
he's gone and so is Sedona.
sorry, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about this ghost.
Oh, Phoenix, the avatar ghost.
Yeah. Ned says he was always online, so I'm going with the theory that he died while playing.
death by gaming o. d.
although, you know, it's very possible in college, I may have collapsed after 10 straight hours of playing asteroids.
you sure that wasn't the kegger?
I did a search for anyone who died while gaming, and suprisingly, they're a few.
I've narrowed it down to that guy, one in Korea and one in Oregon, Curtis Green.
wait, died after 5 straight days of gaming.
what, he didn't eat, he didn't sleep, he didn't drink?
Nope, he died of dehydration.
wait, shouldn't the Internet gaming people be able to tell you who Phoenix really was?
Yeah, maybe, except the only thing I could access was his avatar bio.
FYI, he's into fast cars and coldplay.
coldplay. Could be any teenager anywhere, huh?
exactly, it's the world wide web for god sakes.
he could be a 10-year-old in Siberia.
wait, what about the girl from the bookstore?
she hung out with Phoenix online.
maybe she knows something about him.
that's what I'm hoping.
that looks like the girl that Phoenix was haunting yesterday.
I'm betting that's Sedona.
and those are her laced-up pals with the tatted up avatars.
got it.
so assuming this guy died from gaming, here's what Mel's come up with.
these are from all around the world.
would the ghost have an accent? - This one didn't.
so, uh... go make nice.
see what she knows about Phoenix and this Curtis kid from Oregon.
she doesn't look much like a chit-chatter.
then use some other language.
Oh, well, that was a relatively painless inventory, besides the little computer glitch, or should I say computer ghost.
only apparently he's an out here ghost now because his avatar has not budged since yesterday.
is that what you've been watching all day?
and all night. I'm obsessed.
I mean, I have no idea how to work my own avatar, but I can't stop watching his.
I mean, I drew a spirit out of a computer game. How freaky is that?
Yeah, half the time I'm online, I am sure that there's a ghost in there.
you know, speaking metaphorically.
Yeah, well, this one might actually be.
and if he is, he's a ghost that communicates with the living, which is why I'd like to figure out what his story is.
Yeah, it sounds like maybe this guy is into cosplay, you know, people who dress up like their avatars.
no, I don't know, and how do you?
well, when you have a teenager, it's kind of dangerous not to know.
Hey, I bet you didn't know that it only takes an I. M. Chat for someone to access your webcam.
Yeah, but Ned is smarter than that.
Yeah, I know, I know.
it's just... everybody else I'm worried about.
Yes.
ha, take that, sucka!
Hey, give a newbie a break.
that was you？
it's not right.
you have mad skills and a fast machine.
my dad guilt-gifted it to me after he moved out.
sorry.
Thanks, but I'm over it.
so, uh, you're redstar?
Ned. Yeah, I've seen you in there, too.
I'm Alise.
Yeah, so you hang out with that Phoenix guy, right?
what's up with him? - Oh, don't know.
probably stopped playing and forgot to log off.
do you know the guy, the gamer?
I only know him online.
ever think something might have happened?
like I heard about that guy in Oregon who died gaming.
what, you think it could be Phoenix?
that would be so sad. I really like him.
stay away from her!
the guy who keeled, Curtis Green, died like 3 weeks ago.
well, then it's not him for sure. Phoenix just froze up yesterday.
I was hanging in world with him when it happened. - I said, leave her alone!
you, over here!
talk to me.
do you know him?
what's your game with her?
what's your game?
no, I've never seen him before. - You think you're her boyfriend?
she doesn't even have a clue who you even are.
this isn't real.
you're in a game, it's all fantasy.
she knows i'm real, that's why she talks to me.
you're real in a sense, yes.
but that is not the issue.The issue is, who am I talking to?!
I'm Phoenix, ok?
that's all you need to know. Now leave us alone!
it's the classic case of grandiose delusional disorder.
he believes he's her boyfriend, and she's the perfect target-- sweet, shy, troubled, and she lives online.
and how do you usually treat something like this?
change their frame of reference.
jar them out of their fiction.
like tell him who he actually is?
that's a good start, if we knew who he really is.
well, could we track his IP address through the game?
Hey, they did it on CSI!
I think there'd have to be a criminal investigation.
or we could just... talk to someone where he lives, in here.
he's gone!
Phoenix isn't there anymore. I've been watching since he first came out.
he's been frozen.
he was right there!
he was in there.
what happened? Your avatar started to move.
because I was in there, too. I had a vision.
only, it was different.
it was like I was a part of that world, you know?
I think I was seeing the game the way that he does.
OK, I don't like the idea of that guy in your head.
me either. But if we want to find out who Phoenix is or why he's haunting alise, it might be the only way.
Hey, I'm looking for Phoenix.
he was just here.
are you friends with him?
who wants to know?
you don't belong here.
you don't belong here, either just tell me who you are.
No!
you're ruining everything!
this wasn't real when you were alive, and it's not real now.
there has to be somebody in your real life that you want to talk to.
I can help you!
all right, that's enough!
I don't think so.
if you see a light, pal, go for it.
no way!
OK, that's enough fun.
it was...
everything in there, it was real for my ghost.
you were kickin' some ass.
I was, right?
looked like he landed a few good hits, too.
looked like he was kind of hurting you.
no. I mean, I felt it in the game, but not now.
Hey, his avatar's gone again.
that's ok.
he'll be back. It's the only way he can talk to Alise.
that's not the only way he can be with her.
he's a ghost.
how can we find a guy who doesn't want to be found?
we get lucky.
looks like Phoenix sent you an email.
you want to know me better? Let' meet. I don't understand. Now he wants me to find him?
he's a gamer.
maybe he likes to play games.
OK then.
let's play.
sure! Where should we meet? No good.
guess it would be, seeing how the guy is dead.
some kind of business address.
Ingram, Nash, Reynolds, Coben and company.
that's an ad firm in hamilton.
so our dead guy's this Berrit dude?
OK, you go see if Phoenix ever sent Alise any emails from this address.
we'll see if we can find our ghost.
never heard of him.
is he one of those guys who died gaming?
no, he's just someone I met in-world.
you spend too much time online.
I wish I could spend that much time online.
my mom thinks the Internet's evil.
did you want something? - Oh, no, thanks.
mine's the opposite.
Oh, your mom?
with the web, she's cool, but she doesn't trust me to blow my nose out here in the real world.
well, it would be worse if your parents didn't care, right?
Yeah, I've got one of them, too.
anyway, at least I have my online friends I can gripe to.
OK, but how do you know they're your friends?
you don't really know who they are.
I don't really know you.
true that.
I think you get to know who people really are more online.
barriers come down.
I guess, but...
what about when it goes offline, and it's not what you thought?
have you ever had a thing go offline?
I've emailed, talked on cell, sure.
you felt safe doing that?
safe as anything in real life turned out to be.
you mean, like your family?
thought we'd always be together.
then one day I come home, and it's gone.
no more.
at least with this, I can always count on it being there.
Mr. Berrit...
no, sorry, he's not with the firm.
well, I know he wouldn't be anymore, but did he ever work here?
wait, do you mean Errit, Mr. Bill Errit?
he's in now.
isn't he supposed to be dead?
Curioser and curioser.
Oh, god, not again.
I thought I was through with this.
with what?
about 2 weeks ago, the FBI shows up here.
accuses me of cyber-stalking-- Luring underage girls and transmitting pornography.
so you didn't send the email? - of course not.
someone stole my address, and the guy who did's a real winner, judging from the stuff they thought I did.
what kind of stuff?
he deals in candid, suggestive photos of beautiful young women.
of teenagers, mostly.
God knows how he gets them to do it.
cops said some of them even send in webcam shots of themselves.
I saw the stuff, and I wish I hadn't.
so the guy who sent me the email, he's a predator?
and a good one.
they've traced stolen emails to him all across the country, but he's always gone by the time they get there.
that's the agent handling the case.
if this pervert's after you now, I'd call him.
can't be too sad when a perv bites it.
Yeah, except it doesn't change anything.
I mean, the ghost controls a computer.
it can get young girls to do things, like maybe even turn on a webcam.
well, I know a cop.
I used to help her profile some cases.
let me call her.
look, whoever created Phoenix is a cyber-perv.
he gets pics of teens and puts them on the web!
OK, but if the FBI is handling this case, why are you talking to me?
because I don't know them. I know you.
and you owe me, remember?
what?
Oh, um, the I. D. thief I helped you profile?
fine.
I will try to subpoena the game for an email ID.
but don't get your hopes up. These guys switch servers all the time.
internet cafes, motels, your random, roaming wi-fi.
so even if we get an address, I doubt the guy will still be there unless he's dead.
Yeah, I'm gonna be a little late.
it turns out this ghost is a total creep, so.
uh, you know what?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I want you to stay the hell away from Alise.
No! I told you - Save it.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done to those girls, I know that you've tried to ruin their lives, and you're doing the same thing to alise.
I would never-- Yeah, but you did!
again and again.
I mean, you had to have known better, but you didn't stop, not even after you died.
you're still still stalking Alise.
you're confused.
you don't know who I am.
I just want to protect her.
did you have a good day? Yeah!
get your travel shoes on.
I know where the real Phoenix lives.
let's go.
of course he said he was protecting Alise.
he might even believe it.
the guy's a sicko.
is that a technical term?
Oh, I'm sorry. Twisted sicko.
I don't know, it felt sincere.
welcome to his world of deception.
these guys find out people's weaknesses, and they prey on it.
what's my weakness?
trusting sickos.
Oh, come on - Come on.
we're just going to help ourselves?
not so sure this is such a good idea.
I'm thinking it may be time to call in a higher power-- Shh.
like maybe...the cops.
OK, from the smell, I'm guessing that guy is not asleep.
that's the real Phoenix.
did I call it?
it's a twisted sicko.
something's not right.
Oh, my god.
he was telling the truth.
he really did just want to protect alise. I mean, all of these photos are her.
he's not a predator.
he's Larry Jones, Alise's dad.
Yeah, it was an apparent heart attack. They think he's been dead 3 days.
so that's when the ghost must have gone into the computer.
so he's protecting his daughter, but from what?
and why was he even in the computer?
that's just-- I don't know, but he does.
it's the only way I could be a part of her life.
I had a stupid affair.
my wife was bitter, and it rubbed off on Alise.
my daughter made it clear she didn't want to have anything to do with me, and I didn't blame her for hating me, but...
God, I missed her.
that's when you came up with Phoenix.
well, in there, I felt connected to her.
then what happened?
well, after I died, I found myself back at home with Alise, and I saw that she was emailing someone.
someone in the game?
Yeah, she met him in there.
I mean, I was Phoenix, and Phoenix was her friend, but this guy was...more.
I mean, the emails were pretty intimate.
so you suspected he was a predator?
or a lusty teenager. I didn't know.
I mean, I didn't know if I was being an overprotective dad.
like when you threw me across the street in the game.
look, I just didn't want you to blow my cover with this creep.
but then when I realized that you were actually trying to help, that's when I forwarded you on the emails that this guy sent Alise.
the ones we traced.
so the guy who sent the emails, he was the same guy that the cops wanted for teen porn?
and when you found that out, I went back in the game and I tried to warn her, but she was convinced that he was just a...
happy teen, just like she was, and she would not listen to me.
it wasn't always like that.
I mean, we used to do things.
we used to laugh.
I know.
I saw your pictures.
the one in the jeep?
Yeah.
we took that in Sedona.
she said that we were the Indiana Joneses.
we ran up this hill looking for treasure, and we came down with this leather pouch full of-- I mean, I don't know what.
rocks and feathers and dirt and... she said it was magic.
and that it would protect us forever.
look, you have to warn her.
you have to tell her to be careful.
please.
don't worry.
come on.
excuse me... Alise, hi.
I'm Melinda Gordon.
I knew your dad, and I'm so sorry.
what's this about?
I think your daughter might be in danger.
well, the police didn't say anything about that.
that's because they don't know about it.
the predators reached out to Alise online.
he collects pictures of young girls.
who are you?
I know this is a bad time. - I asked you a question.
look, I...
we, um, talk to spirits, and Alise's dad contacted me, so
OK, that's enough. My daughter just lost her dad, so whatever your story is, tell it to the police.
follow them!
tell them!
what do you want me to say? That her dad is a ghost avatar?
it'll never work.
there's only one thing that will.
what?
we find this guy and we stop him.
are we ready yet?
you're set. All you need to do is get him to email you, then Eli's friend can track the IP.
and wherever that is, Sam said the FBI can send someone there fast.
whoa, that's me?
you said you want to lure him, didn't you?
this I gotta see. There's Alise's avatar, and that's Cal.
that's who I'm looking for?
I think so.
the avatar Alise is talking to, he's the guy you saw in the game the other day.
same guy.
are you ready?
you're my only way in.
OK.
let's catch a predator.
It's...a private chatroom!
you can't get in!
all right, I get it, minus an eardrum.
well, what are you waiting for?
give him your email, for god sakes.
be brazen. There's no dating protocol there.
how do we even know he heard me?
we wait.
Hey, dude.
Hey, man, let's get out of here.
thanks for picking us up.
Cal. Where are you?
I didn't see you in there.
I'm outside.
Oh, snap.
I was inside looking for you, but my friends made me bail.
I was wearing a red shirt.
geek, you didn't see me? You know what I look like. I sent you that picture.
no.
but a bunch of us are going to the dance pad contest later at brookside mall.
how does that sound?
well, I don't know, I don't have a car.
I do. I'll pick you up.
you're the Jones that lives on Latimer Road, right?
wow, you do your homework.
what can I say?
I like you.
so I'll be there at 6: 00.
sure.
C U THEN?
is he still there?
no, he left.
maybe he's at the virtual cafe.
no, he's not.
Cal and Alise have both logged off, so what do we do now?
we wait for him to email melinda's avatar back.
no, I can't wait!
look, he wants pictures.
all it takes is one weak moment, and she's very vulnerable right now.
which is why you have to keep an eye on her.
OK, let us know if he contacts her again.
get a cell phone number, email address, anything.
OK, ok, ok.
go watch your girl.
we're gonna get this guy, we are.
are we?
it's looking more promising.
check this out, just came in.
obviously he read my cry for help.
got his service provider.
Eli's cop friend just needs to track his IP.
hopefully before he moves again.
detective Sam Blair, please.
can't believe he's in Grandview.
Yeah, where's the FBI, the camera, the balloons?
we're about to catch a predator in our hometown.
look, after that last false alarm, you're lucky I'm even here.
he's a regular. About a day every month.
brings his laptop, says he likes quiet.
sounds like a cyber criminal or a cheating spouse.
would you mind opening it, please?
OK, maybe you were right.
or maybe you were.
looks like we found his private stash.
he's here for Alise.
all right, I'm going to need address, phone numbers, and nobody touch anything else in here.
Hey, Cal, what's up? Where are you?
home.
my brother's not back with my mom's car.
bummer. - I know.
this thing's starting in 20. We're all headin' over.
OK, well, have fun.
no, freak, I'm tryin' to tell you, my brother's near your house.
he'll probably drive by on his way home.
well, I don't know.
Oh, right.
you probably need to ask your mom first.
no, it's not that.
it's just-- sorry, my friends are here.
I can't hear.
whatever you decide's OK.
we got in touch with the mom.
Alise was supposed to be home, but she hasn't been answering her cell.
has anyone checked the house?
a patrol car's driving by now.
they're in a blue minivan.
I am never going to get used to that.
what?
that I forgot to tell you that the predator's driving a blue minivan.
license Number GRK998.
license Plate Number GRK998.
OK.
not sure how you forgot that, but I'll tell them.
look, you don't understand, he's there now.
he's picking her up, now, now!
OK, just-- please go and tell Sam that he's already there.
don't worry, all right?
the police are on their way.
you must be Alise.
I'm Cal's brother. Hop in.
we'll pick up the others on the way.
what's wrong?
well, it's just, um... I just...I don't know.
Ah, I get it.
you're not sure you should go anywhere with the big bad brother.
no, it's not that.
it's just... well, I don't know you.
it's cool.
Brian told me how your mom has you on a short leash. I get it.
I'm older, practically an only kid.
you just want to say,"hey,"I have a brain, I can think for myself.
Yeah, that's for sure.
look, maybe when your mom gets home, she can drive you over.
Yeah.
Ugh, yeah, she's... whatever.
anyway, I,uh, I gotta get going.
little bro's gonna be pissed if I make him late, so.
you comin'?
Yeah.
um, just wait one sec.
all set?
get out! Get out of the car!
ready. - Get out!
Alise, no.
No! No! No! Alise, no!
they just left, you can catch them.
I've been calling her on her cell. She's not picking up.
no, no, no, they're not in there!
they're in a van, a blue van!
Argh, this is not happening!
Sam said there's no word yet.
she's in the car.
I don't know what to do, I'm completely helpless!
I just don't know how to protect her.
OK, where are they? Where were they heading?
they started toward Brookside, and they turned off the highway.
I'll tell sam. - There's still something you can do.
no, no, she got in the car!
I couldn't stop her!
Yeah, but you can stop him.
Hello, I tried!
I'm a ghost, people walk through me!
I know that, but you're the only one who can help Alise right now.
look, you love your little girl.
OK, now believe that you can do this.
you have the power to stop him.
this isn't Brookside.
I think you should let me out here.
what are you-- Oh.
look, no one made you get in this car.
you wanted to.
relax, it's only pictures.
I didn't know. - Oh, come on!
you knew.
let's not pretend.
you knew...
daddy's dead. He can't help you anymore.
hazard, hazard.
stop the car. Stop the car.
at the end of the road - What is going on?
did you touch something?
I don't - Turn around when possible.
come here.
get away! No way in hell!
you gotta be kidding me.
OK, all right, OK!
on the ground, on the ground now! - OK!
let me see your hands!
it's ok, sweetheart.
thank god you're OK.
Thanks.
so the FBI's been tracking this guy for over a year.
how'd you get all this information?
I do what any good shrink does-- I talk to ghosts.
I do, really.
no, one showed up last night. It...
I don't know how or why you dud what you did, but I'll never be able to thank you enough.
it wasn't me.
it was your husband.
I don't understand.
it's ok.
I'll explain later.
I didn't realize how insignificant Alise felt after the divorce, so I guess I was just too busy trying to get through another day.
OK, mom, enough sharing.
I think I need a minute alone.
sure.
that was him, wasn't it?
he did all those things in the car?
Yes.
and he's here with us right now.
he can hear you.
he told me about the day that you filled that.
he said you-- you thought it was magic.
because we did it together.
and then he left.
he fought for me today, but why didn't he fight for me back then?
why did he just leave?
tell her-- tell her I'm sorry.
I did fight. I just...
it was too little, too late.
he's sorry.
he never wanted to not be a part of your life.
is that true?
Yes.
tell her, tell her what I did.
he was your friend in the game.
he was Phoenix. He created that avatar just so he could be with you.
my dad?
he hates computers. He can hardly work a cell phone.
well, he figured out now , just to be with you.
wish I could stay now.
I love you, too, daddy.
he sees the light and now that he knows you're safe, he can go.
thank you.
tell him good-bye.
it's ok.
she's gonna be fine, she's gonna be fine.
Sam offered me a job.
And?
I said I was happy shrinking heads and sending disembodied voices into the light.
come on.
you know, you've got to stop telling everybody that you can hear ghosts.
Why? No one believes me.
people are gonna start thinking you're nuts.
trust me, I've been there.
people think I'm nuts already.
we got a possible IED.
batteries, wire, pipe.
five...
confirming no visible identification.
four...
blocking remote detonators.
three...
going to try chemical detection. Burning nerve agents.
two...
this isn't good. - One.
fire in the hole.
4 hours earlier
I'm dying already.
want me to write you a note? Get you out of class?
could ya? Would ya, Officer Lane?
boss, what's the word?
they got a guy coming for the AC.
Alleluia. - Okay.
Oh, come on. - Nice.
okay, we're going to hit the briefing room and then we're going to patrol in air-conditioned comfort.
have I told you recently how much I really do love you?
Hello, boys. - Jules!
how do you manage to stay so fresh?
I think cool thoughts.
Kira, we're going to hit the streets.
team Two's going to hit Rexdale.
sergeant Rangford.
that's, uh, Mr. Rangford to you, sir.
Hey, don't call me sir. I work for a living.
how you doing, Daniel?
I'm doing fine. It's good to see you, Greg.
good to see you, too. You look good.
what are you doing out in the barn? A day like today you should be out hitting a golf course.
are you kidding me? You been out there?
you don't call. You don't write.
Eddie. How you doing?
fine. Fine.
so? How's Sophie and Clark?
they're good. They're all good, yeah.
spike. You still wear the rookie badge?
Nah-uh. This is, uh, Sam Braddock. He's new, but he's trying.
good to meet you, I'm Danny.
hot call, Team One, gear up.
what do we got?
suspicious package. Train station, south terminal.
babycakes, I'm coming! - Take it easy, Danny.
let's go!
Hey, Danny!
keep the peace, boys.
who called it in?
the security guard. He says the suitcase has been there almost an hour.
copy that.
we gotta keep that perimeter wide. We gotta keep it locked down.
Hey, who's that guy at the station?
Danny Rangford. Most decent, honest cop I've ever met in my life.
guy's a legend, retired about a year ago.
he's the guy that brought me into the SRU.
you? - Yeah. Him and Barney Fletcher, the two of 'em, they fought to have us trained in psychology and negotiation.
if it wasn't for them, we'd be straight-up SWAT.
so he was commander?
never made it past sergeant. Avoided promotion.
Why?
keeps you in the action.
thought maybe it was the booze.
you didn't smell it off him?
you new? - Three weeks.
uh, look, do you know if anyone's using the briefing room in the next little while?
Mmm, I don't think so. Team Three's gone off shift. Team One's out.
good. I just want to get a few things in order. Is it okay if I use the room?
go ahead.
I'm just gonna have a walkabout first. Is that okay?
strategic Response Unit.
okay.
morning, Sergeant.
inspector Stainton, what's the word?
we're not liking this. There's been a spike in terrorist chat last two weeks.
station sees over 200, 000 commuters a day.
I say that's "hotspot" written all over it.
Sam, north containment.
Lewis, west. Wordy, east.
spike, do your thing. Jules, second the boss.
stay connected. We're gonna need everyone's brain on this one.
let's get to know our friend.
Kira, can I trouble you a sec?
there's a, uh, file I've been meaning to look at.
a file?
Yeah, it's #5512.
you'll find it under Team Four, 1989.
okay. What's this in regard to?
uh, just getting a presentation together.
you know, old boys on the lecture circuit.
uh, it's probably not on a computer.
uh, look, if it's any trouble I can always go down to the archives myself.
Oh, no, no, no, it's no trouble. I just need to clear it with Commander Holleran.
uh, what do you need to do that for?
Oh, I just can't release files without permission. It's policy.
uh, well, well, it's not like it's a breech of, uh, anyone's privacy.
I-I mean, it was a case of my own. I was there.
sorry. Officially, you're a civilian now. So.
no. You don't need to do that.
look, the old days, one of us at the desk, you know
we'd have looked the other way.
well, I'm sure Commander Holleran...
you're not hearing me.
I didn't come this far.
stay quiet. - But I can just...
just stay quiet. And look down, hmm?
I need that file. Do you understand?
Yep.
let's go, darling.
10: 36 a. m.: suspicious suitcase.
constable Scarlatti initiating electronic counter measures.
I'll wait here. You go on and get the file. Fast is good.
wait. I'll take that.
sorry.
okay, know the subject, anticipate the weapon, target the solution.
what kind of person plants a bomb in a public place?
organized personality, not impulsive, not mentally incompetent.
emotionally detached, above average intelligence.
access to volatile material. and familiar with its use.
Yeah, and who wants to strike the city's transportation hub.
or just doesn't like tourists.
okay, everyone, eyes and ears open.
we may be dealing with an individual who likes to hang around and watch the carnage.
wasn't supposed to go this way, you know?
wasn't supposed to go this way.
could have just given it to me.
all I need to do was go in the briefing room, get a little work done, undisturbed.
I'll make sure you're not interrupted.
well, maybe you're not trained for this at your desk, but where I came from we're trained to profile people, and here's what I get from you: you're ambitious;
you're serious about your job; you don't want to be passive, be perceived as the victim.
so here's what you'll do: I walk into that briefing room, you'll sound the alarm first chance you get.
I try walking out of here, same problem.
man with a gun making unorthodox demands. You see my dilemmas? Smile.
Hey, Kira.
any word on the air conditioning?
tomorrow.
sergeant Rangford?
you hear I made sergeant? Team Three.
so you haunting the old barn? - Yeah.
sit down. Sit. Sit.
okay, confirming no visible identification.
Babycakes is sending out a signal blocking out remote detonators.
going to start with the infrared.
good news so far. Nothing unusual in the heat patterns.
going to try chemical detection for any nerve agents, blood agents.
sergeant.
inspector, anything good?
some of the people that reported the case said they smelled hay nearby.
so? Hay?
moist hay.
one woman said she smelled freshly cut grass.
Stainton, so what are you saying? That someone stuffed the case with hay?
boss. Hay and grass aren't the only things that smell like hay and grass.
those people that smelled hay and grass?
track them down, they gotta be put under medical observation immediately.
no physical exertion or it'll accelerate the spread.
spike, what do you think it is?
phosgene. It could be phosgene.
by the time you smell it, it's already at its lethal level.
you and Michelle finally gonna take that round-the-world trip she kept asking for?
well... maybe.
little hot in that?
Yeah.
you know what? No, I'm-I'm good. I'm good.
anything I can help you with there, Daniel?
I'm fine, Troy. I'm really fine.
I just want to be left alone, okay?
I don't think that's a good idea.
stand down!
stay back!
stay back! - Hey, sergeant?
keep it cool, guys. Everything's okay.
okay, Troy, you're going to keep your boys at a distance.
sure. Sure, Daniel.
you know how this works, boys.
Kira? Kira, did you try to transmit?
what's up, Jules? - I don't know.
this is not the way it was supposed to happen, you know.
never is, right? - No.
look at me. I'm the subject.
you don't have to be, Daniel. We can work this out.
sorry, Troy.
wait. She's sending something through.
team ONE HOT CALL...
Sarge.
IMMBDIATE
Kira? Kira, you copy?
Jules, you're in charge.
all right. - Lean on Stainton if you need to.
Eddie, we got a priority call.
I need you, Sam and Wordy to come with me.
Louis, you cover Spike.
Jules, let's get extra uniforms and detectives.
copy that. I'm on it.
ed, the priority call... it's at the station.
why don't you tell me what's...
don't... negotiate me.
now, go in here.
I'm gonna shut the door.
I'm barricading myself in. You understand what that means, don't you, Troy?
I do.
and you're gonna leave me to my own devices.
otherwise, the situation is going to get dangerous. You know that, right?
right.
I want you to consider me a threat level red.
you got that? - I got it, boss.
I'm gonna stop talking now.
threat level red. Can you say that for me?
threat level red.
that's good.
doing a good job, Troy.
it's Daniel Rangford. He's armed, and he's barricaded himself in the briefing room.
boss. - Talk.
he's got a Beretta, . 40 cal.
panels hold up to that?
Yeah, yeah, they're polycarb. - So, what's he doing in there?
he disabled a security camera.
he hasn't talked since he shut himself in there.
classified himself a threat level red.
negotiated me like I was a rookie.
are you surprised?
can your team cover the entrances?
Yeah, we're all we got, though.
most of my guys already clocked out.
Yeah, we're down three. The rest of us are dealing with the bomb threat.
you want me to call my guys back in?
Yes. - No.
boss, we keep this in the family. We can handle it.
okay, Eddie.
nobody gets in through the front. Garage access only.
I'm assuming he's closed the blinds, but we still need eyes in, so grab some range finders.
go outside and double-check. - Copy that.
Wordy, he's gonna be looking for the snake, so let's use the fiber cam.
got it.
Auto-transcriptor, boss?
we don't need it.
Jules has it anyway.
it could just be for us or... - Or what, Greg?
we could decide that when this thing is over, okay?
all right. Let's use Team Three's.
you set it up, but call his wife first. Her name is Michelle.
let's figure out what's been going on at home lately, okay?
on it. - Okay.
I want you to talk to him, okay?
none of us can stay objective, but you know him best.
Yeah.
all right, good. Kira, walk with me.
so, what do we know about phosgene?
it's not hard to make, and it's nasty.
could take 24 hours to show symptoms, so your victims don't even know they've been exposed until their lungs stop working.
okay, well, Stainton's on top of the med reports.
I'll tell him to alert his units for a potential chemical evac order.
maybe we need to block incoming trains as well. Anything else?
get him to broaden the perimeter, especially downwind.
got it.
okay, Babycakes. Let's take a look inside.
what's this I'm hearing about you being in there with a gun, huh?
telling Troy it's threat level red?
Danny, come on.
last time we talked, threat level red was code for "there's a wife in the station."
it's just me out here, Danny. It's Eddie.
Kira, what happened? He seemed fine when we left. I mean, how did he seem to you?
calm at first. Well, sweating a lot.
Yeah, well, we all are, right?
but steady eye contact, relaxed posture, chatty.
then, when I wouldn't get the file for him, he came off the rails like that wasn't the plan.
what do you think the plan was?
didn't add up: getting the file, preparing a presentation in the briefing room.
he wanted privacy.
think he wanted to leave the station with that file?
no, I don't think so.
and he didn't want Holleran alerted, right? - That's right.
remember anything about the file?
name in it was Gehring, 1989.
89, so there's no computer backup. Anything about that case?
just that it was his. Sorry.
no, no, you did everything right, Kira. Thank you.
you can go home. You're free to do that.
Hey, I'm not going anywhere. I'm a cop, too.
okay. Put on a vest and radio.
call Harvey Silver.
his name and number is on file. He was on Daniel's team.
they retired the same year. Tell him we need him here sooner than ASAP.
Eddie, how is our friend?
he's not talking.
I got eyes in.
fiber optic neutralized.
Troy, you got eyes outside?
he's moving. Looks like he's closing the shutters.
want to try the ball cam?
he's gonna be looking for that. Let's get thermals.
okay, I got it right here.
you sticky my fiber-optic camera?
nice job. What did you use, duct tape?
forgot how much you liked it low-tech.
remember that corner store barricade?
Danny, day like today, hotter than hell. You remember that?
you had me talk to those kids for an hour and half, Danny. Then, you came in.
turned up the heat. 20 minutes later, they came running out.
that was low-tech all the way.
thought you were on a bomb call, Ed.
we're on it. Just came back here to see what was going on.
I'm not here to negotiate you, Danny.
I just want to help you figure it out.
all you've done for me over the years. Come on.
go back to your bomb call.
Frank's on it, Danny. You know the bomb guys.
you know what's good for you, you stay out of there.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay right here long as it takes.
Danny, what are you saying to me? How long?
about 14 more ounces.
11: 27 a. m. Barricaded subject, Daniel Rangford.
boss, how do you want me to characterize the subject?
barricaded. Leave it at that.
you talk to his wife?
Yes, I called her.
I told her her husband was at the station, and she got really upset; she hung up on me.
it's all you. - Boss, come and see this.
he's shooting at nothing. He's shooting at a chair. I got thermals.
on the ground.
on the ground!
Danny, our weapons are not raised. We are not here to hurt you.
down... down!
Danny, talk to me.
Danny, it's Greg Parker.
what's going on, buddy? What are you shooting at?
what's going on? - I don't know.
he's shooting at somebody who's not there.
is it hallucination?
Yeah, maybe flashbacks or something.
where is Daniel? I want to see him. Where is he?
what the hell is going on, guys?
no one through the front. - Ma'am, you cannot go in there.
Sam, Sam, it's okay. Michelle.
I want to see him. Where is he?
let's just walk over here for a second. - Where is he?
we can talk about it over here. Let's just walk over here.
I want to see him. You bastard, you bastard.
it's your fault. You do this to him, all of you. You bastard!
just calm down. It's okay. It's okay.
just go with Kira, and we'll find you a place to sit down, okay?
and I promise I will come to you as soon as I can, okay?
Michelle, let's sit down. It's gonna be okay.
boss. Take a look.
all right, that's enough. I'm gonna open it up.
he said he was gonna fire.
you want to spend the rest of your life thinking about what we shouldhave done, Wordy, huh?
Wordy, cover. Sam, we're opening up.
okay, boss. - Okay, go.
I told you not to come in!
let's slow this down, Danny.
close the damn door!
I'm not gonna be able to do that, Dan.
one step closer, we're done.
okay.
let the subject set the pace.
don't rush a negotiation.
cause I'm not finished here.
and I'm going to get this thing, right. Okay, Eddie?
okay.
back off.
boss?
I'll go talk to Michelle.
I think he's slowing up, so let's just keep him on his timetable, okay?
okay.
he's arriving now.
Harvey, I'm Sam, Team One.
where is he? I want to see him.
that's not gonna happen.
I got to talk to him. He'll listen to me.
Harvey, this isn't a good idea.
this is garbage. I can't just stand here.
Harvey, there's not a guy here who feels different, but we just need to streamline the inputs a little, okay?
ed Lane is with him now.
Eddie's with him? - Yeah.
okay. - Okay... good, we need your help.
we need you to rember everything you can about the Gehring incident in 1989.
this is not good.
we got a possible IED. Batteries, wire, pipe.
is that shrapnel?
it could be; it's not nails or ball bearings... some kind of small objects, though.
this thing could be on a timer.
it could be motion-sensitive, so we're not taking it anywhere.
we detonate it here in the square?
negative. Detonating will only release more gas.
we do a render-safe with the water cannon.
okay. We got to disrupt the mechanism.
and turn the phosgene into hydrochloric acid.
I promise you'll see him as soon as we know it's safe.
safe?
Michelle, we need to understand what he's doing, where he's coming from.
can you help us?
Yeah, of course I'll help.
thank you, 'cause, um...
cause you're the one who knows them best.
you think?
I know the guy I married. I remember him. This guy?
I mean, I was counting the days till he retired.
till he came back to us.
to me and Liam.
wake up to the world.
have a barbeque, put up his feet.
enjoy something.
didn't work out that way, huh?
no.
cause when he took off the uniform, it turns out there was nothing left underneath.
almost there.
all right, we've just got to get past the part of him that sticks to a plan.
so maybe we bypass the logic brain, force him to run out of there.
thinking about tear gas?
the animal instinct in the midbrain thinks it's Johnny run for air.
I don't recommend it.
Why's that, Danny?
you're going to have to evacuate the whole building for three days just to breathe in here.
three weeks with a sanitation crew.
we're not worried about making messes, Danny.
think it through, boys.
want to cripple the SRU?
all on the gamble that I didn't think of, uh, packing a gas mask in this bag?
does he let you touch him?
no, he doesn't.
and I don't mean just in bed.
I try to hold his hand, he pulls away.
the last time he touched me, I woke up with his hands around my neck and he was screaming at me.
he's been hanging off a cliff these years.
he won't talk to me.
not about work, he never has.
and he won't talk to you.
cause he knows.
you'll shake your heads,"Oh, so sad to see the great guy fall.
what happened to him? We thought he could hack it.
and you'll turn your backs so that you can keep on pretending that he's the exception.
Michelle, it's going to be okay. It's okay.
Danny. We are not playing chess here, now.
you're thinking about a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
I appreciate your faith, Ed, but...
right, then you've got to appreciate...
don't interrupt the subject! - Don't handbook me, Danny.
Danny, faith is what you need when there's no proof.
we don't need faith to know that you deserve to live.
Oh, yeah? That's something you can prove?
Yeah. Yeah, I think I can.
let's talk about all the people whose lives were made longer because of you.
don't start.
the Gehring incident. It was a home invasion.
Regent Park, but this little place was neat as a pin. You know who's keeping house?
little 18-year-old.
parents are both deadbeats; one's in jail; one's AWOL;
and she's holding it all together, looking after her little brother and sister.
what happened with the home invasion?
by the time we got on scene, the bad guys had gone.
the girl, she'd taken a whack at one of the guys with a baseball bat, scared him away.
so the team went back out on patrol, and Danny and I stayed behind to write it up.
that was it?
the little guy, ten years old, wanted to show us his baseball card collection.
I said,"No, we've got to go." And Danny says, "No. Let's stay."
he just bought a fresh pack for his own son, went out to the truck to get them.
we sat crossed-legs on the floor.
middle of the afternoon, summer day...
trading baseball cards with little guy...
it was good.
you remember this pretty clear for such a long time ago.
Yeah, well, you would.
two hours later, it wasn't our file anymore. It was Homicide's.
that little girl down by the dock. Remember her?
she was turning blue.
you could hardly breathe and you did mouth-to-mouth on her in the ambulance, all the way to the hospital. Buddy, you saved her life.
you stayed with her the whole time and then they called from the hospital.
to say,"Congratulations. She's gonna live."
Danny, you got the Silver Shield for that, buddy.
proudest freakin' nine seconds of my career.
cause then they give the punch line, which is something we don't tell the rookies, hmm?
about how the girl was brain-damaged from lack of oxygen.
Oh, yeah, she's going to live, like a vegetable, shriveling up until her family decides to pull the plug and put her out of her misery.
which I've got to say, seems to be a good idea right about now.
I know you're self-esteeming me like crazy here, but you know what?
that's the last thing I need right now. That's the last thing.
excuse me. - Okay, Danny. All right.
let's take a break.
he's almost at the bottom of that bottle.
the more we talk, the faster he drinks. Let's just...
take a little pressure off, okay?
boss, I'm not going to leave him.
all right, you stay. You stay, but let him do his thing.
okay. - I need to find out what's going on in that file.
okay.
we get the homicide file yet?
squad car's flying it over.
give you a deadline?
Yeah, what's left of his bottle of scotch.
Harvey, what do you remember?
two victims: older sister, younger boy.
perps got away.
tragic as hell, but it's nothing we don't see.
Yeah, but why did this one get to him? What was different about it?
did you ever talk to him about it?
I don't know. You know how it goes. I might've asked him how he was doing?
What'd he say?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
inspector, we're getting ready to counter the package here.
no one comes close.
perimeter is locked up.
Thanks.
Danny, you thirsty at all in there?
Danny? A little water, buddy. I'm going to roll it in there, okay?
no surprises.
nice and easy.
incoming from Homicide.
Gehring, Jeremy, August 8, 1989.
august 8. - That's today.
find out why.
we got a witness tape.
all right, dig out a VCR. Let's get some answers.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me. It's Beta.
Oh, he's almost finished that bottle. I'm going to open it up.
are you sure?
Yeah, we need more access.
Sam, I need you. Troy, grab your guys.
we're going to open this up.
what's happening?
Michelle, I need you to stay out of range.
I won't hide in there anymore. He's my husband.
you know what? You're right. You're right. I want you to come with me.
I want you to hide behind the shields, and I want you to stay close.
all right, we ready? We ready? Sam.
Danny? Listen to me, man. Don't do it!
Danny, put the gun down!
Danny? Michelle's here!
what are you doing? You can't be here. Get out of here! You shouldn't be here!
I'm not going anywhere, Daniel.
get her out of here!
I'm not going anywhere!
don't make me do this in front of her!
Danny, just listen to me now.
get her out! Get her out of here!
Danny, put that gun down.
we're not leaving you, Danny! We're not leaving you!
go on!
in five, four, three... two, one.
fire in the hole.
hold fire. - Hold fire.
Daniel! Please!
Michelle, he's not going to hurt me.
he's not going to hurt me. Are you, Danny?
crossing the line. You think I won't do it?
cardinal rule. Gun's pointed at an officer.
sometimes you've got to break the rules, Danny, remember?
remember who taught me that?
I'll do it.
I'll do it. - I have the solution.
Wordy, damn it, go.
no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
you know what you've got to do.
you've got to keep safe.
you ever seen this before? Do you have any idea?
no. No.
you're going to hide.
it starts here.
do what Jeremy told me to do.
he told me to stay under the bed.
so I didn't see them.
but you think they might have been the same men that had come before?
don't know why they came back.
cause he said we'd be okay.
who said you'd be okay, Petra?
the policeman with the baseball cards.
he, he said we'd be okay. Then he went away.
but he didn't know that they'd come back, Petra.
but maybe he did.
because, because he told Jeremy.
what do you mean, "He told Jeremy"?
he said,"You know what you've got to do."
you've got to be brave and show your sisters.
and so Jeremy wanted to be brave so he could save me and my sister.
but it didn't work. It didn't work.
boss, we got something. Home invaders came back.
boy stepped up to protect his sisters, Daniel and his team were done.
Daniel didn't do anything wrong.
it was something he told the boy.
Yeah,"You know what you gotta do? You gotta hide."
no, that's not what he said. He said,"You know what you gotta do?
you gotta show your sisters you're brave."
what was the boy's name?
okay, thanks. - You hide like that.
shell, you got to go.
you can't see this.
Daniel, I'm not leaving you!
Daniel, let's talk about Jeremy.
the file you wanted.
I'm guessing it was about Jeremy, right?
cause today's the day. Isn't it? August 8?
it's funny those days that stick in our minds.
guessing that Jeremy was a pretty brave kid.
but I don't know that for sure.
could you, could you help me out with that one?
Danny, you can't do this.
you can't do this without...
without telling us why!
I know...
I know...
about a kid sitting on the floor.
I went back.
he didn't look any different from the last time we saw him.
his eyes were open.
he's looking at me, baseball cards spread around him, but he's real quiet.
he's real still and I'm thinking, "Why is he so still?
Why? Why doesn't he say,'hi'?
then I see it.
he had a screwdriver buried into his throat.
and I put it there.
you didn't put it there, Danny. Criminals put it there.
if I hadn't been called there, I wouldn't have said that to him.
"you got to be brave for your sisters."
if it wasn't me, he would've lived.
you don't know that, buddy.
I spent my whole career screwing up.
being too late, being too early, not saying the right words.
I spent my whole career looking at the worst 20 minutes of other people's lives and I can't take it anymore.
Danny, how about rembering the good stuff?
the good stuff-- all the lives you saved.
all the people whose lives were made better, the lives that were made longer because you were there for those 20 minutes.
I can't remember, you see? I can't remember! I can't remember!
all I see are the ghosts.
all I got are the ghosts. The ghosts.
I can't take it anymore.
please.
please help me.
pull the plug.
pull the plug. - Okay, wait.
No!
okay.
Danny, this isn't about Jeremy.
these guys think it's all about him, but it's more than that.
isn't it?
Jeremy's just who we always think about.
I get it.
I get it.
you know what, buddy?
every time...
every time I look at a damn scope, I see a kid run across.
I see a spray of blood.
you know what else, Danny?
you know what else I see?
all the calls we didn't get to in time.
the mothers that we couldn't talk down.
the kid who thought it'd be fun to pull a gun on a cop.
you're not the only one who sees ghosts, Danny.
I got to tell you, I don't know where to put them anymore either.
Eddie, please, no.
you taught me everything I know.
you made me who I am, Danny.
you can't... You can't tell me...
that this is how it ends.
you can't. Give me that gun.
it's gonna be okay.
stand down. Stand down.
it was harmless.
they just wanted to keep us busy.
silver
inspector Stainton, those witnesses are free to go.
hay and grass.
I'm going to take you to a place.
a place I've been myself.
and we're gonna get through this.
we're gonna get through this.
strategic
I thought we were gonna keep this one in the family.
Yeah, families and secrets, you know?
I don't think that's such a good thing.
I'm sorry.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system...
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if you're number's up, we'll find you.
did you hear? Moretti's getting out of the slammer.
Moretti? Do you think Elias knows?
kidding me? I think Elias arranged it.
wants him out in the open.
where the hell did you come from?
felt like a walk.
50 miles from Manhattan?
open the gate.
don't tell me you're here for Moretti.
how did you know he was being released?
should have guessed.
whenever you show up, trouble's right around the corner.
what's your plan, Carter?
I got authority to offer Moretti protection.
in exchange, he tells us how to get New York's public enemy number one.
his own son.
his own son Elias.
you there, Finch?
not for long. Have you seen Moretti?
enjoying his first breath of freedom.
you going somewhere?
got another number issued by the Social Security Administration two months ago to a woman named Leila Smith.
either a new citizen or a case of identity fraud.
all I could find was a work address.
we're working Moretti's number, Finch.
I need you at HQ.
the numbers don't wait in line, Mr. Reese.
be in touch.
Carter, NYPD. Remember me?
cops all look the same.
you know Elias is looking for you.
I don't see him. - Not yet.
but I could put you somewhere safe, try to keep you alive.
now I remember you now.
you're the one Elias wanted to kill.
the cop who's on her own.
looks like nothing's changed.
you don't work here, Leila.
you're a patient.
any idea where he's going?
he used to own a house out here.
Hello, I'm Dr. Tillman, here to see Leila Smith.
Dr. Adalian asked me to check the status of her bronchitis.
she's pretty well over that by now.
nonetheless. Do you have her chart for me?
here she is.
our own little angel.
no parents listed.
Oh, Leila's a safe-haven baby.
Dr. Adalian himself found her outside the clinic.
so who applied for her social security number?
that was me.
I wanted to be sure the state knew who Leila was, even if her own parents didn't care.
normally she'd be given up for adoption by now, but she had medical issues like her bronchitis.
she'll find a home soon.
thank you, nurse.
Hello, Leila.
now who in the world would want to hurt you?
we're here for Leila Smith.
here to transfer her to another clinic.
Mr. Reese, I think I have a situation.
me too. I have to get back to you.
this way.
looks like an accident.
go around them.
please, can you help us?
keep going.
get out! - Police! Drop your weapon.
come on, let's go.
I heard what happened.
you're very lucky she was there, Mr. Moretti.
Yeah. Who are you?
detective Szymanski.
another cop.
do I have to stay here?
you're a free man, Gianni.
you can walk out of here and into a bullet anytime, or you can stay and help us get Elias before he gets you.
a mafia don in hiding.
you plan on clearing this with your bosses?
it's already cleared.
Elias doesn't own the whole department...
not yet.
still a few good cops like Szymanski in there, who want Elias taken down and think Moretti is the best way to do it.
anyway... Thank you.
you're welcome.
stay out of trouble.
Hey, Finch. How's it going?
it's going.
what about Moretti? - Elias had getting-out-of-jail party planned.
we crashed it.
what happened with the other number, Finch?
cat got your tongue?
I'm afraid I may have done something rather rash.
what do you mean by "rash"?
is this one of your ties, Finch?
I hope you gave her some food and not just your hand-me-downs.
chicken and prunes is her favorite.
sounds, um, disgusting.
but why on earth would anyone want to kill her?
somehow I don't see anyone planning a murder here.
my guess is that, if they were successful in kidnapping her, they'd smuggle her out of the country and dump her in an orphanage.
somewhere where babies are plentiful and birth records aren't.
but why do they want to get rid of her?
she might be evidence of an affair, or she might be an obstacle to someone getting a big, fat legacy.
as for who they are, I have no idea.
but since she kept me up all night, I looked into the clinic's finances.
they received a big gift.
$50, 000 just about the time Leila was born and $10, 000 every month since then.
who's the donor?
anonymous.
I sent the clinic a sternly worded email from the IRS demanding the donor's tax ID number and threatening to review their charitable status if they didn't answer quickly. We'll see how that works.
Uh-oh. Amber alert.
baby kidnapped from St. Raymond's clinic last night.
suspect is a short man with mousy hair and thick glasses.
it's not very flattering, Finch, but better than the picture.
it's no wonder they never catch anybody with these things.
you think Carter can piggyback the police investigation?
I'll ask her.
you can spend some quality time with Leila.
detective.
has Mr. Moretti given you anything on Elias?
not yet, but, um, we're working on him.
who you buying that stuff for?
that's why I wanted to talk to you.
a baby went missing from a clinic in Washington Heights last night.
missing? It was stolen by some weird-looki...
no. You didn't.
she was in imminent danger of kidnap.
so you kidnapped her?
you know there's an amber alert out on you.
Yes, and that's why we need your help.
help? I should arrest you.
Where's the baby anyway?
Leila's safe. She's with John.
John? John? You trust him with a baby?
I realize it's not ideal.
so the sooner we can resolve this, the better.
what do you want me to do?
apart from not arresting you.
go to the clinic.
see what you can find out about Leila's parents.
I heard she was a safe-haven baby.
clinic's not going to have that information.
I think they know more than they claim.
talk to a nurse Abbot.
she seemed especially fond of Leila.
Congratulations.
is it your first?
that how you keep your boyish figure?
did you hear Gianni Moretti got out of prison yesterday then vanished?
all state police found was five dead goombahs.
mobsters killing each other... How tragic.
except it wasn't just mobsters.
your partner was there too.
looks like she and a couple of cowboys got some kind of rinky-dink off-book operation.
they've hidden Moretti.
we want to find out where.
hr can't find out?
thought you guys had your fingers in all the pies.
you are one of the pies, Fusco.
find out where she's got Moretti stashed.
like I told the other detectives, we don't know about the parents.
Leila was just left outside the clinic.
was there anything found on Leila?
I'm Dr. Adalian. Who are you?
detective Carter, SVU. - Detective.
as I'm sure nurse Abbot explained, we don't know where Leila came from.
you must have kept something.
like, what about her clothes, her blankets? - No.
the, uh, safe-haven law was designed to protect newborns, not prosecute their parents.
it's not our job to hunt people down.
thank you.
I'm sorry.
excuse me.
all I care about is Leila.
if you can think of anything, call me.
please.
this flap here, that flap there, see?
neat and simple.
I see your time at MIT wasn't wasted.
Oh, excellent. The accountants at the clinic have coughed up the tax ID numbers of their donor.
nothing like a fear of the IRS to produce results.
tax ID belongs to Petrosian Construction.
company owned by...Adnan Petrosian.
and if we dive into that swamp of indiscretion known as social media, we will learn that...
adnan Petrosian has been married to Nicola for more than 20 years.
they have one son Bradley, who's taking a master's in finance at NYU.
be serious, Mr. Reese.
I need you to get close to this family.
got eyes on the Petrosians, getting ears.
these guys have serious money, Finch.
you probably go to the same country club.
be that as it may, do they seem like a family that's lost a baby?
behavior has damaged this family's good name, and I've already spent a fortune getting you out of trouble.
Oh, I'm so sorry I embarrassed you, dad.
Bradley, I want to know, is this it, or are there more unpleasant surprises?
it's been taken care of, okay?
looks like mommy and daddy are covering up for the son.
how about a delicious bottle?
Finch, are you listening? - Mmm.
Oh, there you go.
detective Carter's phone.
can I have Detective Carter, SVU?
Carter works Homicide, sweetheart, not SVU.
this is Carter. How can I help you?
it's Mary Abbot. The man on the phone said you worked Homicide.
Oh, don't worry about him. He's new here.
how could I help you, Mary?
Leila did have something on her when she arrived... A bracelet.
do you still have it?
I gave it to the director, Dr. Adalian.
I asked him, but he said he didn't remember.
what did it look like?
it was silver with two initials carved on it. CC.
okay, thank you, Mary.
I'll talk to you soon.
all right, Detective.
I've found one CC. working in the Petrosian home, Carrie Crosswell.
but she's 58... A little old for a fling.
now I'm checking employee files at Petrosian Construction.
you hacked into his company? - "Hacked" is such an ugly word.
and we have two more CCs.
Chad Colombo, 40, a welder, unlikely to bear a child.
and Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.
Claudia Cruz. Checking.
employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.
get me an address. I'll go and talk to her.
no, you won't. She's dead.
name showed up on a crime scene report.
died in her apartment from a fire four days ago.
me ruled it as an accident.
Aw, cute. Can we say hi?
Oh, she's so adorable.
Aw! - Hi, honey.
look at that smile. - Thanks. Bye.
you brought her with you?
every cop in the city is looking for that kid.
I'm teaching her to go undercover.
she's a natural.
she's a little angel.
something happens to her, John, so help me, God...
we're trying to stop anything from happening.
we know she was in a clinic funded by the Petrosians, and we know her mother worked for the Petrosians.
so it's probable that the father is one of the Petrosians.
but why does mom end up dead?
maybe she agreed to give her up for adoption, then changed her mind, said she wanted to keep it.
well, that would expose the whole thing.
DNA would prove who the father was.
he'd have to provide for the baby.
the family would lose out. - It's motive.
bump off the mom, make the baby disappear, problem solved.
we need to find out if Claudia's death really was an accident.
I already pulled the autopsy and crime scene reports.
I want to look through them with a mentor of mine.
works for the Fire Department. - Good.
I'll see if Claudia's parents know anything.
John will follow Bradley Petrosian.
after I've fed Leila.
Bye-bye.
Mrs. Cruz. Lucas Bennet.
department of Family Services.
he says he's here about Claudia.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
why are you here?
we had a report, um...
from a neighbor of Claudia's... An anonymous report...
that she was pregnant.
she was not. Tell me who said that.
please, Mr. Cruz, the source is anonymous.
we have to investigate.
okay.
Claudia wasn't pregnant.
I'm her mother. We talked about everything.
when did Claudia move into her apartment?
about nine months ago. Why?
about the same time that she stopped working at Petrosian Construction?
did you see her during that period?
not for a few months, no.
she was kind of funny about us coming around.
did Claudia have a silver bracelet?
Yes, with her initials on it.
my mother gave it to her when she was a baby.
please, just tell us.
was she pregnant? Did she have a baby?
we believe it's possible.
then where is it? Can we see it?
I can try to arrange a meeting on neutral ground, but it would have to be kept confidential.
Oh, of course.
what else can you tell me about Claudia?
was she in a relationship, for example?
she left some papers here about a month before she died.
we found this.
I think he's Mr. Petrosian's son Bradley.
any luck, Mr. Reese?
Bradley Petrosian has been a good student.
hasn't phoned anyone, hasn't spoken to any suspicious characters.
so are we barking up the wrong tree?
maybe.
hang on.
he's meeting someone.
you were right about the wrong tree.
what?
I don't think Bradley Petrosian was sleeping with Claudia Cruz. - Sorry?
his tastes run in the other direction.
so we should look at the father, Adnan.
I'll get eyes on him.
how's their baby doing?
Oh, she's...
Reese, you better get back here.
makes sense. Lots of candles.
one catches the drapes.
do we know why Claudia didn't run?
blood screen showed traces of alcohol.
so she was drinking. She fell asleep.
faulty smoke alarm.
fire Marshal said the battery was dead.
battery isn't the problem. Wiring is.
the hot wire is just plastic coating.
the wire itself was removed.
no connection, no alarm.
dead battery could be an accident, but this...
you got the autopsy photos?
Yeah.
me said heat caused the cracks, not trauma.
high temperatures can cause the skull to fissure.
cracks all along the plate lines of the skull.
there is no natural plate line there, but...
it was caused by a blow. - Yeah.
she was unconscious when the fire was set.
but a blow with what?
bone was cracked.
wasn't pierced or shattered.
something round.
like this?
could be.
you wash the soot off that, you might get lucky.
heat can etch fingerprints into the metal.
could give you your killer.
but how could you let her go? - I didn't.
she just knocked down the books and walked off.
she can't walk, Finch.
Oh, God.
I'll never forgive myself.
give it to me now, Leila.
please just give it to me. - You got her?
Oh, my God, that's a grenade.
please just...
just a tear gas grenade.
it's still a grenade.
you're okay. You're okay, sweetie.
come on. It's okay.
I told you to move your arsenal.
I was going to. - When?
after the whole place is blown up?
you know how I feel about guns.
this really isn't working, one of us always being here, minding the baby.
well, you're the one who stole her.
thanks for reminding me of that.
I'm gonna take her to her grandparents.
they can keep an eye on her until we neutralize the threat.
Finch, the bad guys got to Claudia.
here we go. - They could be after Sammy and Veda too.
that's why I've already moved them to a safe house.
what, are you working a case without me?
just an accidental death, which might turn out to be a homicide.
who is it? - A girl named Claudia Cruz.
just left the crime scene.
might have found the murder weapon.
I am so sorry. I got caught up.
I'll be there as soon as possible.
anything I can do to help?
think you could take these down to the crime lab for me, ask them to put a rush on it?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks. - But is that it?
Szymanski... Isn't he Organized Crime?
Carter, you know I got your back, right?
szymanski asked me out on a date.
can you not spread it around, please?
I'll try not to.
look, why don't you go ahead and I'll run this down to the lab, all right?
Thanks, Lionel.
I owe you.
I'll check if it's clear.
what did you get?
there was a GPS tracker on their car.
it's not your fault.
I'm sorry you're still in danger.
we have to move you again. Can you get your things?
if we don't recover Leila tonight, she'll be out of the country.
gone for good.
any idea who those men were?
they're Albanians or Croats.
probably one of the eastern European crime groups.
what are you gonna do?
whatever I have to.
how come I only ever see you or Szymanski?
if this Elias is such a big deal, where's the rest of the NYPD?
you got a bad memory, Gianni.
Elias just tried to kill you.
the more cops know you're here, the more chance of him finding you
so for your own sake, help us find him first.
Carter.
Hey, Carter, yeah, I was in the crime lab.
they said they had a rush job for you on some murder weapon in a Claudia Cruz case.
they get anything?
Yep, they got a match. Your killer was in the system, thanks to a road rage incident about ten years ago.
what's the name?
who are you? What do you...
security!
where is she? - What? Who?
the owner of this kidnapped Leila.
tell me where he's taken her.
I don't know. I swear to God I don't.
you had an affair with Claudia Cruz, didn't you?
okay. Yes.
you had Claudia killed and the baby kidnapped. - No.
I would never do anything like that.
what are you gonna do, torture him?
you've tripped the silent alarm.
the police are gonna be here in five minutes.
have weapon.
I'm not gonna torture him because your fingerprints are on the weapon that killed Claudia.
Nicola, what did you do? - Shut up.
did you hire the men that took Leila? Did you?
Yes.
call them. - I can't.
the number doesn't work anymore.
Where'd you get it? - Family in Europe.
I called it. A man answered. I told him the problem.
once I paid him, he said the number would be dead.
and I couldn't contact him, not even to stop the job.
and the job was to make Claudia's death look like an accident, get rid of the baby.
how could you do such a thing?
somebody had to clean up your mess.
and there's nothing you can do. They're gone.
I want the man that owns this.
he has kidnapped a child, a baby.
I want to know where he is.
Really?
one more time.
how do I find him? - I don't know.
I will kill you.
so kill me, but I still don't know.
your baby's gone.
whoever he was just handed him over.
even he couldn't tell you.
so go ahead.
shoot.
so no one knows where she is.
not no one.
there is someone who knows the underworld, the soldiers, the gangs, the syndicates.
come on, you're not serious.
you still have that burner phone?
no, we can't use it.
Leila is in the hands of men who won't hesitate to kill her if things go bad.
it's still too risky.
I'm all out of moves, Finch.
risk is all I've got left.
I have to make the call.
why would he even agree to meet with you?
because he'll be curious.
John, it's good to see you again.
so tell me, did you fall out with your boss?
are you looking for a job?
I'm looking for help.
from me?
why would I help you?
I saved your life.
you did, didn't you?
but you also broke up a little family reunion that I had planned.
that was you, wasn't it?
honest to a fault.
what's this about?
someone kidnapped a child, murdered her mother.
just like Moretti murdered your mother, stole your childhood.
I survived. - This child won't.
she's six months old, a baby.
I know you're aiming to take over this city, but to control it, you need rules.
people start targeting children, there are no rules.
no winners.
who's behind the kidnapping?
eastern Europeans.
they've been paid to get the baby out of the country.
and they're moving her tonight.
their remit doesn't extend south of Jersey.
they'll hand it off to the Mexicans.
they're the people smugglers.
a hand-off like that...
you can find out where it's happening, and you can get me there.
Hand-over's at 1637 Camden.
you might get there in time.
I would have just shot you, but the boss has got a soft spot for you.
there's no one in it. - Over there!
last chance. Put your weapons down and walk away.
okay. All right. Whatever you say, man.
come on. Go.
stop, I have the baby. I said, "stop.
put the bag down.
no.
you'd just shoot me.
you're right.
it's okay, Leila. You're okay.
I got you.
Finch, I've got Leila.
I'm bringing her back.
she's okay.
won't be long, huh? Okay.
sorry. Boss had a change of heart.
what have you done with the baby?
she's right here, John.
we had an agreement.
but then I realized there is something you can do for me.
tell me where Moretti is.
I don't know.
this is a refrigerated truck, John.
it will get very cold in there very quickly.
you'll be able to hold off for a few hours, I imagine.
but this little one, on the other hand...
just shout if you change your mind.
don't do this.
anything on Carter yet?
I followed her.
learned something.
what?
What'd you learn?
she...
she had a pizza.
she got a thing for pepperoni.
and I got a dead body with your name on it.
don't think I won't use it.
find out where she's got Moretti.
just hold on, Leila.
please.
Hey, Fusco.
yeah? - Crime lab came through.
wanna go harass Claudia Cruz's murderer?
Yeah, sure, why not?
one second. I got to take this.
Carter. - Detective.
John recovered the baby, but then I lost him.
lost him? And the baby?
last-known location, 1637 Camden in Brooklyn.
anything you can do, Detective, please.
okay.
sorry, Lionel, something's come up.
Nicola Petrosian. She's all yours.
come here. Come on. Come on, baby.
come on.
Elias. Elias. - Yes, John?
all right.
you win.
we both win, John.
Where's Moretti?
what guarantee do I have?
you don't.
1465 Jefferson...
Queens.
thank you, John.
you were right. I would never harm a child.
but then I knew you wouldn't either.
good-bye, John.
come on. Come on, baby.
come on, baby.
cry. Cry.
Leila's in the truck. I got to take your car.
what on earth happened? - Elias happened.
Elias knows where Moretti is.
how does he know?
I'm on my way. Just get over there.
szymanski, Carter, we've been blown.
get Moretti out of there now.
gianni! It's Szymanski.
just in time for a drink.
afraid not. Carter says we got to move.
quick. Get your stuff.
are you there, Mr. Reese?
I'm here. So is Carter.
Oh, no.
I need a bus. 1465 Jefferson, Queens.
officer down with a gunshot to the abdomen.
I repeat, officer down.
they got him.
how did Elias know?
I told him.
I had to give up the safe house to save the baby.
John, why were you even talking to Elias?
I had no choice.
we lost the kid.
you say there was no choice, but there was, John.
it's called the police.
it's what we do.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't.
you and your friend.
I'm sorry.
go on.
this place will be swarming.
go.
go!
Bye, Leila.
you be a good girl.
thank you so much.
be nice to have a child.
children.
think that'll ever happen?
probably not.
our line of work.
the trouble with children...
you never know how they're gonna turn out.
Hello, dad.
well, he's right.
you are the best thing about this dinner.
and this day...
...and this year.
I wish it was simpler.
I wish it was easier.
and I'm sorry.
well, I'm not expecting flowers, but...
...will we call each other?
well...
...Iook, I was kind of...
...hoping for flowers.
I could live here.
I didn't say that to scare you.
I scared you, didn't I?
so will you come and visit me?
you mean inland?
I don't go inland.
we have a lake.
a big lake.
okay. I'll just go back to my work and my son and...
...you'll just forget about me, right?
every day.
I've got your number, sailor.
and you've got mine. So...
Bye.
and then what happened? - Later, later.
the wanderer returns. How are you?
yeah? So, solve your mystery?
there was no mystery.
he lost his wife, Catherine.
she was an artist.
and dead but not forgotten.
right. So that's it, end of story?
basically, yeah. There's no story.
kind of like... Was it me that said that?
so!
Toodle-loo, on your way. That's enough.
any regrets?
zip.
no? Good.
so, what was she like?
she's beautiful and wispy and.....a great artist.
and she's everywhere.
she's in his house.
she's in the shop.
the whole town knew her.
is he still in love with her?
she isn't gone.
that's for you. And that's very interesting.
research. This is Theresa.
it's me.
I know.
sorry, I've been...
I'm finishing the boat.
my boat.
I just wanted to tell you.
how are you?
it's been a quiet few weeks.
I didn't know.....what to say.
I still don't.
need some help?
I was counting on it.
question: Were we just a casual thing or something else?
possibly a beginning?
just answers, no pressure.
just a playboy? Nail those tourist women.
I've only.....cared about two women in my whole life.
Catherine and...?
some city girl.
big mouth.
pushy.
Thanks.
you just called to tell me about the boat?
I miss you.
I miss all of it.
why don't you come see me, Garret?
it's just a visit. It's not a promise.
is that enough?
listen, you think I'm betting on us, but I'm not.
I'm just as scared as you are.
and I miss you too.
okay. When?
when should I come?
yesterday.
you're not coming by boat, are you?
jet Ski? Windsurfer?
so behave yourself.
you got your ticket?
of course I have my ticket.
got my name on all my clothes.
and I got a quarter for a phone call.
you got a gift for that kid of hers?
get one at the airplane gift shop.
don't get into any fights or anything.
there it comes.
right on time, just like your old man.
don't throw your back out.
take your pills.
by my count, there should be 2 beers left in the fridge when I get back.
that's a sorry occupation, counting other people's beers.
if you get Kenny or any tourist kids to score you beer...
...I'll hear about it.
I got two counties covered.
that lady sure got you gut-hooked.
how'd you get to be so mean?
see you in a week.
the hell you say!
not with your plane ticket on the seat here!
good dog.
I think he's here, Mom.
you're kind of nervous.
Really?
I look great though, right?
okay, is what I meant.
you made it.
come in.
I think he's disappointed that you don't have a captain's hat on.
that's what he was expecting. Right?
come on in.
I don't know if it suits a boy your age, but...
it's great.
Thanks.
sweet, Garret.
he's into this mayhem thing.
I think it's a male deal.
garret, thank you.
she hates chocolates.
it's really weird.
true?
Yes, but it was very sweet of you.
excuse me.
thank you. That's what I really wanted.
you got to be beat, no?
I hope this is okay.
this is fine.
I mean, this is perfect.
tomorrow night, Jason will be at a friend's house. So...
meaning what?
shut up.
I know this isn't very romantic. - What?
this is my life.
it's nice.
I just want you to know me.
just the day-to-day, regular me.
you think you know me?
what?
what?
he's not coming.
but I've come so far.
I don't even know.
I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad I'm here too.
we're almost there.
wait. Is that him?
that's him.
Oh, my God. Don't say a word.
Hey, buddy!
what are you doing here?
train's pretty cool.
can I use the computer?
Jason wanted to surprise you.
hope it's okay. - It's fine.
it's only for a minute, then we'll hop back on that train.
he's scared of it, Mom.
I'm not scared of it.
this is where I work.
it was nice meeting you.
well, now I can picture you on the job.
so that's him. That's Ahab?
that's him. He's no Captain Ahab.
smile at him. Be friendly.
friendly people. - I know.
he's smiling at her. That's sweet.
Oh, behave!
you're so negative, Charlie. Don't you want her to be happy?
she'll smell of haddock for the rest of her life.
I don't know what I was expecting.
I mean, I didn't realize.....everybody's close.
Theresa, this came as a big surprise to me...
...but apparently it is the poodle that is the number one dog.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
Hi, Lina. - Hi, Jason.
Jason is taking Garret into town sailing now.
Really? So soon?
if he doesn't get lost first.
I know there's a lake around here somewhere.
he senses that.
sensitive. If you get into any trouble at all...
...certainly give me... the paper... a call.
you want to steer? - Sure.
you're the captain.
you got to keep us going straight.
straight ahead.
here you go.
how you doing? - Good.
the gang. Hi, Lenny.
Bye, Mom. - Have fun.
say bye to your mom. - See you!
I'm not used to having you here.
it's okay, Garret.
it's nice.....being among your things.
well, is it what you expected?
it's comforting.
you're making me self-conscious.
what are you looking at?
Theresa in her home.
the regular everyday...
wait.
I really.....wanted to make this right.
I just wanted to straighten up my room and light a candle and...
and I need to take a shower.
garret, wait.
that was a goodie. - So scared.
I'm so scared.
that was big.
I'm going to take a shower. Finally.
wait. Just...
you're not going to believe what...
Oh, God. Garret.
where did you get this?
I found it.
what do you mean, you found it?
I found it on the shore.
garret, wait.
it came to me.
you have to trust me.
trust you?
I just had to meet the person that wrote it. I had to meet you.
I was going to tell you before. - How could you find me?
because I tracked all of the messages and there were clues...
all of the messages?
they've all been found and people saw it in the column and they wrote.
I swear to God, I was going to tell you, Garret.
garret, wait.
I got to get out of here.
garret, wait!
why did you do this?
Why?!
were you curious?
it's goddamn research! - No, I'm falling in love with you!
first in the letters and then when I met you!
and I'm sorry! I was afraid!
I was afraid if I told you that I would push you away!
just like I'm doing now.
wait!
no matter what you think of me...
...and no matter what happens now, I want you to know...
...how much I care for you.
and it shouldn't matter..what brought us together, Garret
I sent those letters into the sea to her. Not to you!
not to all your friends at work!
I know.
they all knew about me, didn't they?
all about Catherine?
my life was changed by those three letters.
I didn't want it printed in the paper. - Two letters.
you've got to believe me. - I sent two letters to Catherine.
what?
I have all of the letters. I have all three.
Where's the third letter?
is it in that drawer?
to all the ships at sea.....and all the ports of call.
to my family.....and to all friends and strangers.
this is a message and a prayer.
the message is that my travels taught me a great truth.
I already had what everyone is searching for...
...and few ever find.
the one person in the world.....who I was born to love forever.
a person like me, of the Outer Banks...
...and the blue Atlantic mystery.
a person rich in simple treasures...
...self-made, self-taught.
a harbor where I am forever home.
and no wind or trouble...
...or even a little death can knock down this house.
the prayer is that everyone in the world can know this kind of love...and be healed by it.
if my prayer is heard, then there will be an erasing of all guilt...
...and all regret...
...and an end to all anger.
please, God.
Amen.
I never knew what she wrote.
She.....never came back from that day.
I dried her. I tried to keep her warm.
took her to the hospital.
she never...
she died three days later.
I keep thinking if she hadn't gone out that day...
garret, she knew.
she said it.
"not even a little death can knock down this house." She knew.
I want to.....keep this.
I'm sorry. Would you rather be alone?
has he called?
I left him a message, though.
I said I was sorry.
and I asked him to call.
well, then, he will.
lina, do you remember...
...what I was always complaining about?
all those times you let me cry on your shoulder about David.
remember?
honesty. Trust.
I was so scared.
I don't...
I was falling in love with Garret and I...
half of my mind was saying, "Tell him..."
...and the other half was saying...
..."Just wait. He's not going to understand."
wait till the right moment.
just wait till you have the right words. You know?
and I blew it. I just...killed it by being what I hate:
a liar.
you're not a liar.
but to him I am.
and I don't think he's ever going to be able to trust me now.
don't you understand we all have our own little lies...
...and our little unspoken truths?
and you just have to have a little faith that he'll understand that.
I don't know.
I don't know if he can.
I saw his pain. He was holding her letter and he was reading it.
and there was just.....so much pain and...
he has so much love for her, you know?
I don't know.
you said if I was ever thinking about writing a piece for the paper...
no kidding.
is he in here?
no.
other stories.
good stories.
it's about time.
people get hurt, they shut down.
till the pain goes away?
I don't know.
maybe you just learn to take it in like everything else.
kind of like a few pieces of cork in a great glass of wine.
you don't want to miss the wine.
is that in here?
the cork in the wine thing?
no.
good. I hate it.
it may be that most of us write our own life story...
...making it up as we go along.
but others seem to have lives that are already shaped and planned...
...inescapable...
...perfect as a circle.
open it.
slowly.
this is exciting. - It is.
front page of the section! Great!
Thanks, bud.
can I cut it out?
sure.
is this okay? - That is great.
that's perfect. Thank you.
here's your mail, ma'am.
thank you.
sure.
nice.
I love what you've done here.
very minimalist. - Very nice of you to stop by, sir.
Yes, well, I come bearing a gift for your new phone booth office.
can I hang it? - That is so sweet.
I know.
you'll never guess who it is.
you seem happy.
is anything all right?
Ahab.
may I?
if you decide to go do something wild and ridiculous...
...it'll only prove one thing.
and what's that?
he's one lucky old son of the sea.
that's a Charlie Toschi quote.
you know, somebody's going to think you're drying your skivvies up there.
you look nice.
Yeah, well, it hurts.
she's beautiful, Garret.
Thanks, Marta.
go get them!
nice job, Garret.
to Catherine.
to Catherine.
wish to God...
wish to God she was here today.
every day.
my dad said you were there.
wish I'd have known.
a surprise. Dumb idea.
no, it's...
it's great to see you.
glad you came. - Me too.
I saw the boat. It's beautiful.
it's great.
I'm happy for you.
you want to come inside?
I'm sorry.
what I said must've hurt you.
I just heard what you couldn't tell me.
or maybe what I couldn't hear.
and I understand now.
I think it's so beautiful the way you love her.
no, you don't have to say anything.
it's what made me want to find you.
then stay with me.
come inside.
just stay as long as you want.
I thought about it. I thought about a lot of things sitting out here.
and I can't stay.
Why?
because if you can, you'll come to me...
...when it's right. And if it's not right, it's okay.
because I wouldn't.....regret one minute.
not one.
Bye.
I don't want to lose you.
then don't.
why do you always sit in the same place?
what the hell you care where I sit?
I'm curious. You started sitting here 10, 11 years ago.
for chris sake!
you used to sit over there.
get the boy a cup of coffee.
you look like hell.
I'm okay.
catch up to her?
you let her go.
I don't want to talk about it.
listen, I was... - Go away.
she made up her mind.
the hell you want? - Persistence.
get crazy. Go nuts. A fight, for chrissake.
you spent one afternoon with her.
you don't even know who she is.
What's...?
Chicago.
three minutes. Get on the phone.
it's your last chance.
of course she walked away.
she ain't stupid.
think she wants to try to come between you and...
I don't have it all figured out. - Who the hell does?
think it's easy for me to see another woman in your house?
well, it ain't easy.
I'll tell you one thing...
...I'd give a million bucks to see you grab her...
...and figure it out as you go along.
just drop it!
drop it? - Yeah. Drop it!
just...
...forget about it.
I can't!
I can't forget about it.
why the hell not?
because you're my boy.
it's not your business. - What?
I said it's not your business!
turn around.
turn around.
make a fist.
make it!
now you hit me!
hit me in the face, you son of a bitch.
not my business?
my son is not my business?
what the hell else have I got.....that's close to me?
who else ever.....stuck up for me?
think I don't know your pain? I do.
some of it I put there. Think I can forget that?
when she went to New York, you could've gone with her...
...and here I was, sick, drunk, flat on my ass...
...bringing you down.
maybe the two of you, it could've been different somehow.
I didn't stay for you.
this is who I am.
this place. This is where I belong.
she came back because she found out she belonged here too.
she chose for herself.
God, I loved her for that.
so did I.
now you choose. Choose...
...between yesterday and tomorrow. Pick one.
stick with it.
and I will shut up.....and leave you alone.
so you'll always know where you are...
...and where home is.
love, Theresa.
you heading for blue water?
Yes, sir.
well, you know what you're doing.
got it all figured out.
Hey, bud.
time to get up.
another day.
they call him the Mayor of 43rd.
he's so sweet. He knows everyone. Helps people.
the point is, it's his 70th birthday.
Theresa, there's a phone call for you.
can you take a message?
it's urgent.
excuse me.
you better take it in my office.
is it Jase?
Hey, girl.
I better.....get this said while I can still talk.
there was a boat, Theresa, offshore in trouble.
a family, there was three of them.
garret tried...
well, he tried to help, and...
it's bad. He went down.
what do you mean?
he went in after them.
he got two of them. But he went down, Theresa.
I am so sorry.
that's all I got now.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
hard times.
come on in.
I found it on the boat.
it was in his slicker.
dear Catherine:
my life began when I found you...
...and I thought it had ended when I failed to save you.
I thought that hanging on to your memory was keeping us both alive.
but I was wrong.
a woman named Theresa showed me that...
...if I was brave enough to open my heart...
...I could love again, no matter how terrible my grief.
she made me realize I was only half-alive.
it scared me and it hurt.
I didn 't know how much I needed her till the night she flew away.
when that airplane took off, I felt something inside me tear away.
and I knew.
I should have stopped her.
I should've followed her home.
and now tomorrow, I'm going to sail to the windy point...
...and I'm going to say goodbye to you.
then I'm going to go to this woman...
...and see if I can win her heart.
if I can, I know you'll bless me.
and bless us all.
if I can 't...
...then I'm still blessed because I've had the privilege of loving.....twice in my life.
she gave me that.
and if I tell you I love her as much as I loved you...
...then you'll know the whole story.
rest in peace, my love.
if some lives form a perfect circle...
...Others take shape in ways we cannot predict or always understand.
loss has been a part of my journey.
but it has also shown me what is precious.
so has a love for which I can only be grateful.
sometimes, life is so perfect.
isn't it?
it has to be. To make up for all the hard stuff it throws your way.
you have to learn to walk.
you have to learn to talk.
you have to wear that totally ridiculous hat your grandma bought you.
you have no say in the matter.
and when you're a little older, even though you get to choose your hats, you don't get to choose what they put in those meatballs at the cafeteria.
or when to fall in love.
things happen, and you just have to deal.
and breathe.
let's just think of the day my parent's divorce came through as " Big, Ugly Hat Day. "
refer to diagram B on page 1 9.
" the Tree of Life. "
and breathe.
...Anybody but his own selfish pleasure.
mom, please. - Focus.
I couldn't care less about your father's midlife crisis and complete mockery of his wedding vows.
I just hope he doesn't expect me to take
Halley, l'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
guys-- -Where do you think you're going?
as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
excuse me, everyone. I
mom? - Sorry.
I have some really important news to announce here.
Lewis and l-- we're getting married.
he asked me last Saturday night.
I wanted to tell you, but I wasn't sure when, or how you'd react.
I told him I couldn't even wear this ring until after I talked to you.
but we wanna have this big Spring wedding.
mom, l'm so happy.
nice timing, huh?
tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.
why does love make people crazy?
Scarlett, you weren't picking up your phone. I'm so sorry.
Halley, that's Michael. Michael...
Hi.
thank you.
Bye! I love you!
what do you think?
you didn't tell me you were doing it.
when you meet the right person and you fall in love...
it's like...it's like everything you thought...
you thought is...
can you believe it?
no. I can't.
Scarlett, come on.
you are sounding dangerously close to a Hallmark greeting card.
you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
Yeah.
you can't expect to do anything great in life if you buckle the first time some guy bats his eyes at you.
news flash, Hal.
even Madonna eventually got married.
my mom thinks that means there's hope for her, too.
your mom wants to get married?
well, she wants to fall in love, Halley.
everyone does.
Hi. I've been in
Hi. I've been divorced for a long time, so my baggage is ancient history.
I like to think that I travel light these days.
except for my daughter, Scarlett, who is just a joy of a carryon.
I think l'm taking the baggage thing too far.
maybe I should start over.
you know what I think of this whole idea.
I'm only gonna send it to the online guys who pass my rigid five-point checklist.
here, you try.
go away. - Lydia.
the man of your dreams is sitting out there right now waiting to hear from you.
speak to him.
I don't think the perfect man is gonna want to hear what I have to say.
sure he does, Sweetie. Speak to him.
go on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Perfect...
but if you're waiting for me, it's gonna be a hell of a long wait.
see, l've had it with men like you.
I think it's terrific that you have a great job, and you're sensitive to the needs of others, and you jog three times a week to keep the belly at bay.
but the second some silicon-breasted, butt-kissing, airhead climber half your age comes along, you can't keep your pants zipped.
well, fuck you!
that's right, Mr. Middle-age, think-you're-a-big-shot, phony asshole.
you ain't getting any from me.
okay.
I think we'll just give this a little time.
so juvenile.
I'm glad you're back early from camp, even though it was a dishonorable discharge.
what happened? Where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
no comment.
no comment?
I don't speak to the press.
I'm the press?
Yeah, and anything I say can and will be used against me, right?
I would never use anything against you.
dad, give it up! It's old, and you need to get your own material.
daddy Dog. - Yo.
Len Martin. It's you, right? WDYG's coolest DJ.
that's me.
" we dig the dog! "
love your show, man. - Thanks, man.
you are the hippest old guy I know.
yo, dude! I'm not that old!
that's Len Martin.
Hello, gorgeous ones.
and you invited her.
Hey, Baby. - Hey.
I thought we'd spend time together, then we could have a chance to bond.
Well...Iook at you, Halley.
that's hard to do without a mirror, isn't it?
honey, you keep getting prettier every day.
I have no idea how you could say that, cause...
you definitely don't see me every day, do you?
and yesterday, oh, my God, I was so ugly, and last Wednesday-- that sucked, too.
so it's kind of a day to day thing.
I love that sense of humor.
just like her daddy.
look at that gorgeous girl. - Dad, stop it.
she's got her daddy's hair.
don't cut it. - lt's beautiful.
don't cut it. Just let it grow, let it grow.
don't cut it.
cut it.
okay.
let me count the ways that this card can be used to induce nausea, gastric distress, vomiting.
Yeah, go ahead and mock me, but this is serious.
I need to find something funny and something sweet
just the way Scarlett is.
remember last time I got her-- - Okay. Look, here's one.
not helping.
" from small beginnings come great things. "
" congratulations on your new baby. "
I thought you were gonna help.
lighten up, Sherwood.
" the first time we met, you stole my heart. "
" good luck in finding a compatible organ donor." Nice.
I'm kidding, okay? It's blank inside.
you know something? You're not too funny.
this girl is amazing-- unlike you
and she's sensitive-- unlike you.
and she's sexy.
unlike you.
there's gotta be a card... - Is that Michael?
...for a redhead from... - I can't see.
...a newly smitten hunka hunka burning love.
I mean...Iook.
summer romance has its own section.
it's not a summer romance. I mean...
scarlett is... - Standing right behind you, dude.
Hi.
sneaking up on me?
Hi, Halley. - Hi.
you remember my name?
sure. We were in Biology together.
Yeah, I know, but...
well, you were never there, really...technically.
I like your hair.
thank you.
see, my schedule is all wrong, which I think is a sign that nothing's going according to plan this year.
it's a complete and total mess.
looks like a fine schedule to me.
no. Band? I would never sign up for band.
what's wrong with band? - I don't play anything.
well, maybe you should. I'm sure you can handle it.
Mrs. Toussaint, this is not my schedule.
look, l'm signed up for Algebra, and l've already taken Calculus.
maybe a brush-up is a good thing, not to mention a good grade.
why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
okay, l'm signed up for boys' P. E.
94 FM - Fill out this form.
daddy Dog. - We'll start again.
Len Martin with a traffic update from that love puppy in the skies, our very own Lorna Queen.
Lorna, you up there?
Hi, Len.
on a clear day, you can see forever, and this is one beautiful morning.
should we tell everyone our little secret?
careful. Baby, you sure this is the time?
I am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping.
I just spilled the beans.
that is your father's show, right?
I just love it.
Hi.
tell him congratulations.
I'm sure you're very excited about the upcoming nuptials.
my father and my sister.
my sister and my father?
your father and your sister are getting married?
Yeah.
no, not to each other.
I...
I have to check something before I fill this out.
sit down, Forrester.
let's see if we can sort out your usual chaos.
maybe you'll even do us the honor of attending this year.
okay, later, M. T. I gotta rethink that shop class.
I'm pretty scary with tools.
Oh, my.
you didn't know about your dad getting married?
Yes, I did.
the bastard tells the whole world before he tells you.
he's not...
whatever.
at least if they're eloping, you won't have to go the wedding.
weddings are the worst.
me? I've had to go to, like, fine between my parents.
don't ask.
listen, M. T. wasn't giving you a hard time back there, was she?
Mrs. Toussaint and l-- we're on close terms.
you get to know your guidance counselor really well when you're clearly in desperate need of guidance.
see, l've got it down to a science.
you try the Jedi mind trick.
what's that? - You never saw Star Wars?
no, I saw it. I guess I just didn't memorize it like you did.
well, that's your loss, isn't it?
because the Jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.
for example, M. T. says, " Macon, you're already in trouble, and it's the first day of school.
is this any way to start the new year? "
pretend you're me. Nowwhat do you say?
okay. I say...
no. I wanna be someone else.
cute. No. You as me say...
Mrs. T, you're gonna let this one slide because it was an honest mistake, it's only the first day of school, and the fire was put out as quickly as it was started.
you didn't really start a fire, did you?
the point is that you put the words into somebody's mouth and they give them back like they've come up with the idea.
like when I ask you to go out this Friday night, you're gonna think you're asking me because you're gonna say, " l would love to go out with you " because I know we'll have a great time together.
in fact, l've been hoping you'd ask me all week.
you wanna go out on a date with me?
see? I told you you'd ask me.
Macon, I think I like you too much already to actually go out with you.
what kind of logic is that?
it's logical logic.
the quickest way to ruin a relationship with someone is to actually try to have a relationship with them.
haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
I am, too--boycotting.
you can't boycott your father's wedding.
it's not even a wedding. It's...an elopement.
Yeah, except everyone within his radio frequency is invited.
my God. He is such a hypocrite.
I cannot believe he wouldn't tell us about it first.
he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
none. - She was at that dinner?
no.
okay, yeah. She was there at the end.
mom, come on. She wasn't even supposed to be there.
you know, I don't think l'm gonna let him walk me down the aisle.
please stop worrying about me. I am fine. I'm fine.
in a way, it sets me free. I feel strangely liberated.
and he is still your father, after all, and if he wants to make a complete and utter fool of himself by trying in some pathetically cliche' fashion to recapture his sorry state of manhood, by hooking up with not even a very attractive bimbo...
then if that's what he wants, l'm fine with that.
someone toss, please.
now.
this is our reception area.
with out post-ceremony champagne bar...
which is conveniently located right next to our very own chapel.
can't you picture walking down this aisle?
in a coffin.
sorry, it's just... a little depressing.
actually, nobody's ever said that before.
Lewis...say something. What do you think?
well, I like it. It's very clean.
clean?
is that what you want our wedding day to be? Clean?
it's not...it's not pretty, it's not intimate, it's not romantic.
I'm just so happy that I get to marry you.
I'm sorry, not to pressure you, but this space does book up quickly for Spring.
we have another couple
why don't we give them a moment to think.
Ashley, Sweetie, they plan the whole thing.
the food, the flowers... even the place cards.
think about how much less hassle it'll be.
you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
it hasn't even been that long.
19 1/2 hours.
wouldn't Michael look cool in that?
Hey, I did a good job.
michael Sherwood would look good in anything.
that's not the point, though, okay?
enjoy him, and fool around with him.
don't fall in love with him.
why do you think they call it " falling, " anyways?
it's not worth it to you to spend on a wedding.
it's the most important day.
I was trying to kill two birds with one stone.
cheap is what that is.
you see cheap, I see convenience.
look at them.
they're like a walking warning sign against romance.
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek who has my sister under some spell.
now all this formerly semi-intelligent person thinks about is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.
it's like K-Mart.
how am I supposed to knowwhat it looks like?
maybe go by and look at it? Or maybe
see? They don't even like each other.
but this stupid spell they're under makes them disregard all the facts.
they are fighting because they love each other enough to care.
I didn't know it looked like a K-Mart before I went there.
once we got in there, you knew. - I made a mistake.
too bad you can't get a divorce before getting married.
you could save yourself in that stupid extra step.
l'm sorry. - See?
what are you looking for? - These dishes, they're perfect.
that's love, Halley.
okay, fall once and you may never be able to get back up again.
geek! Get out of here.
isn't he adorable?
he's cute.
all right, Michael!
way to get that goal!
okay, guys, line up!
okay, back up. Let's give him some air.
Sherwood? You hear me?
guys, back up. Give him some air, all right?
call the doctor.
I thought my parents' divorce was the end of the world.
that was before Michael died of a heart defect.
and the world stopped.
or it should have.
I'm sorry.
what do you think?
I think it's 1 00 degrees out.
what am I supposed to do?
the only black clothes I have are winter clothes.
I have nothing nice to wear.
I don't think it matters, really.
look, this is...this is dark green and it's really nice.
it's ugly, Halley.
I'm just trying to think about something else.
anything, for one single second.
I wanna look good for him.
does that sound crazy?
this was a bad idea.
Yeah, but dying is definitely not one of the better concepts.
no, the dress. Everyone's looking at me like l'm a freak.
okay, it's not for them. It's for Michael.
remember that.
can you believe what she's wearing?
that's, like, so disrespectful.
she always has to have all the attention to herself.
although it droop and die that night, it was the plant and flower of light.
in small proportions, we just beauty see.
and in short measures,
Iife may perfect be.
Mr. Macon Forrester will now address us.
I was gonna read from this...
but l'm not very good at reading.
or writing...
or spelling.
not like Michael.
he was good at so many things without even trying.
he taught me how to be myself.
by myself.
not to worry about what other people think.
even if that means being completely uncool.
he taught me about how to trust people.
and how to love.
cause he was so good.
he loved his family, he loved his friends.
he loved basketball.
and he loved Scarlett.
and he loved this.
take this woman, Lorna Queen, to be your lawful wedded wife, your partner, the queen of your heart, forever and ever?
Oh, yeah!
daddy, rock on with your woman!
and do you, Lorna P. Queen, take this old guy Len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
I do.
wrap it up. We're off in 15 seconds. Go.
our airtime is almost up.
we must now go where Federal regulations will not allow you to follow, if you know what I mean.
Lewis, no barking.
sorry, but you gotta go.
poor little thing.
I know just how it feels.
out with the old, in with the new.
and who do you think you are?
just because you've got great petals.
Oh, my God. I'm talking to my plants.
Oh, my God.
you're talking to your plants.
how was it?
it was great...
if you happen to be the Devil and enjoy human pain.
tell me something.
I don't know! What do you want me to tell you?
wait! No, the bimbo almost died of strangulation.
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.
her wedding veil took on a life of its own and rebelled, and she had to claw her way out.
and you know that woman can claw.
it was so sad. It was like near death by wedding veil.
just tragic, isn't it?
Oh, my God! And their vows?
was Dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
I'm sorry.
your father's not a loser.
although he did choose to look like one at our wedding, too.
he insisted on wearing a powder-blue tuxedo.
then why do people get married, anyways?
we know they're lying to each other, but are they lying to themselves, too?
how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
things do sometimes change, Halley.
this house is awfully big for just the two of us, don't you think?
what? - You'll be going to college soon.
Mom...a year and 3/4 is not really that soon.
I want to start thinking about streamlining.
maybe we should sell the house.
I grew up in this house.
Yes, and there have been some great memories in this house.
this is my house.
I understand how you must feel, but life changes.
this is ridiculous, Mom! Come on!
and I don't want to live here alone.
I have to give him a ride.
Bye, Halley.
stand back! Leaf man to the rescue.
where did you get that?
a guy's gotta pay for gas and bacon burgers somehow, right?
and toys, cause I imagine
star Wars figurines must get pretty expensive.
I do not have any Star Wars figurines.
not many, and I don't play with them...much.
this one's on the house.
okay.
here you go.
you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
no, but that's a good theory, I guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.
'cause you can't handle rejection.
rejection? Whatever!
of course you think it's weird that I didn't just use the phone, but you're also glad because it's much better to talk in person.
especially when l've come with such a specific purpose.
which is why you're gonna cut me some slack.
you are absolutely crazy.
I've been called worse.
you're gonna kiss me, Halley.
you're gonna come a little closer...
so I can put my arms around you.
and on the count of three...
you're a really good kisser.
you tricked me.
you Jedi mind-tricked me.
Halley, is that you out there?
close your eyes. Go to bed.
give me a break. - Who are you talking to?
I'm sorry, l...
sorry.
I just...I needed to talk.
I was just coming over for a little late-night chat.
we're not gonna stay up very late, okay?
at least do it inside.
" nausea " ?
a little.
" breast tenderness " ?
Yeah. Major.
" food cravings " ?
grapefruit.
come on, I could answer " yes " to most of these questions, too.
I used to hate grapefruit.
what's wrong?
no offense, Halley, but...
...your perfume is making me sick.
come on, l'm not wearing perfume. I use soap.
" heightened sense of smell."
okay, so do you prefer direct pee-on-a-strip or dip-in-a-cup?
maybe it's a false reading.
because I have heard of things such as false readings.
and the strips did not look completely pink, only kind of pinkish, so
five kits, Halley.
what am I gonna do?
so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.
it wasn't a joy ride. - Maybe I should
don't think you're off the hook.
you don't even have your license, and you are a terrible driver.
I was helping Scarlett get some books at school--we left them
forget it, Halley!
mom...
taking your car out is gonna seem like the least of it...
because whatever you're thinking right now...
it's worse.
one of you better tell me before I have a nervous breakdown.
I'm pregnant.
well, thank God you told me in time.
shouldn't I be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
I'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.
lt's an emotional time. - All right. I was just joking.
just because you think up something you think is funny, doesn't mean you say it.
okay, Ashley, l'm sorry, all right?
it's just... I love the dress, really.
I feel like a princess. You know?
I look awful.
we'll fix it.
it's not the dress that needs fixing.
it's me.
Ashley, would you drive Halley home?
I have to get back to work.
give me my money back, you stupid, lying, feckless, two-timing son of a bitch!
can I help you, madam?
it stole my money, so, just...
here.
this works a little better sometimes.
what's your pleasure? - Diet Coke sounds good.
the last one.
on me.
I hope I didn't, you know, kick it too...
I think these machines are built to withstand a good booting every now and then.
steve Beckwith. - Lydia Martin.
did I say " Martin " ?
it's Lydia Williams now.
Lydia Williams again. - Williams, again?
nice to meet you.
thank you.
aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
you sound like Mom.
can one of you zip me, please?
you guys know you're wearing the same dress, right?
unbelievable.
you're grandmother's in there changing.
we practically are.
l'll change. - No, l'll change.
I can change. - No, I shouldn't wear black, anyway.
Halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
because the Warshers are really traditional. Thank you.
sweetheart, do you need the loo?
grandma, no. I'm gonna use the one downstairs.
don't be silly. Come on in.
okay. - l'm almost through.
it smells like...
just burning a little incense.
mother?
are you smoking the cannabis again?
I had a little headache.
but l'm feeling really much better now.
I knew we'd be late.
we're fine.
his parents are promptness nuts.
I can't believe l'm late.
that's what happens when you make people change ten times.
these leaves would make a wonderful textile.
Halley, look.
I'll bet if we make sheets of this pattern, we'd make a million dollars!
mother, please, not now.
she's high.
she's not high, she's medicated.
it's interesting-- when you make the " ow" sound, your mouth does this funny thing in the corner.
you're not sick anymore.
you were only allowed to use weed when you were sick.
could you ring the bell? - I do get headaches a lot.
smile.
does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
this is a total disaster.
shit!
hello.
now, I know it's turkey day, but we thought squab would be most special.
they're absolutely adorable.
squab. - Can I say l'm a vegetarian?
no.
it reminds me of a little yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.
such a sweet, smart little bird.
they look wonderful. - Thank you.
marcella's such a truly magnificent cook.
we are lucky to have found her.
I bet there's a story in that.
tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often.
grandma.
she came with us 20 years ago, when we moved here from Atlanta.
she really raised our Lewis.
I didn't realize you were a working mother.
I wasn't.
she did go through a brokerage training program.
she was good. Killer instinct.
but she set her sights on me, instead.
I'd say I got the best deal at the firm.
he's all right.
he's no Clark Gable... but then very few men are.
what was the name of that character?
Ashley.
no, you're Ashley.
the wedding plans are coming along beautifully.
well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
I want this to be a memorable affair.
Carol does throw one heck of a luncheon.
that is my one regret about not having more children.
having girls must be such fun.
but we always felt that having an only child was a much better way to mold and shape character.
Ashley was alone for her first six years.
I like to think she got the best of both worlds.
my best friend is an only child.
she's having a baby, which at our age is something that obviously wasn't planned.
and her mom is not really thrilled about the whole situation, but I really think she's kind of starting to get behind it now, so...
which way to the bathroom?
down the hall and to your left.
isn't it a surprise--our children choosing to get married so young?
I always thought Lewis would take his time to find the right person.
well, it must be the example of you and Dad.
I mean... you make marriage seem so fun.
and Ashley's a lot like you, Mom.
she's a very determined woman.
open the door, Halley.
young lady?
open the door. Are you all right?
lovely evening. Thank you.
thanks for sticking up for me. - What are you talking about?
your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married.
you made it sound like l'm some desperate woman somehow forcing you into the whole thing.
I did not.
Ashley's a very determined woman.
I didn't say that.
I have witnesses! Mom, you were there.
you did say something along those lines.
well, that is not how I meant it.
Lewis, you have a lovely family and that is what is important.
they weren't exactly lovely to you.
Oh, You actually work for a living, you lower class, pathetic divorce?
Ashley, enough.
I'm the one who got humped by a dog in there.
where are we? - You'll see when we get there.
lt's too dark to see. - Well, just hold on.
me and Sherwood found this place a couple years ago.
we used to come here.
you like it?
Yeah.
Yeah, come on. Let's dance.
no. - Yes.
come on, Macon.
no.
please? Come on, Macon.
no. - Please.
you look great, but I just...
Michael's parents moved to Florida.
you still have to tell them.
I know.
I just can't figure out what to say that makes any sense.
which makes sense, given that none of what's happened makes any sense.
you know, it's weird.
because if you were the one that was pregnant...
I would understand you considering having an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption.
you can still put the baby up for adoption.
no.
I know all the arguments.
and I know what l'm giving up.
and I know that nothing is gonna be normal for me anymore.
but what is normal, anyway?
growing up with my mom sure wasn't.
losing Michael wasn't.
I used to think that my family was the picture-perfect example of normal.
us.
maybe being abnormal is what's normal...right?
Yeah, like you and Macon.
it doesn't make sense you falling in love with a guy like him.
I'm not falling in love with him, I like kissing him.
we're just friends.
with benefits.
shut up.
Bye, l'm leaving. - You've got it bad.
I hope this isn't a bad time.
I know this is awfully forward of me, but...
I can't stop thinking about you.
you're out of uniform.
Oh, that. I forgot I was wearing that. Didn't I explain?
I'm a Civil War reenactor-- a little hobby.
I like thinking about a time when honor and chivalry really meant something.
I know l've been slow to take action.
Slow's good.
would dinner tonight be too fast?
Yes.
I mean, no. I mean, l'd love to.
Cheers.
friends?
friends.
Steve, I had a lovely time.
good night.
I was just-- - You were just leaving.
exactly.
this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
you said it-- my own home.
that implies I have a right to choose what I do.
Halley Marie Martin, conduct unbecoming.
No!
you never told me you were serious about this boy.
I'm not serious.
that's what you do with people you're not serious about?
you know what?
maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now.
where is all this attitude coming from?
this is not like you.
like me? You don't even know me.
maybe you're just not very good at knowing people.
how well do you know that strange boy?
mom, He's not strange, okay? His name is Macon.
and maybe if you paid attention to anyone
God forbid--besides yourself and Ashley and her stupid wedding, you would know that.
I'm trying.
Halley, you used to talk to me.
Yeah, and you were too busy hating Dad to listen.
I'm sorry you've had to go through this.
I hate Dad so much for doing this to us.
I hate him, I hate him.
and then I don't hate him, and I feel bad for hating him
sweetie, I don't want you to hate your father.
he's a decent man.
I don't want you to hate me either, but I am going to have to start laying down some rules around here.
here we go.
Halley, you're grounded until next year.
no.
you promised me that I could go to the New Year's Eve party with Macon--Mom, please!
no. No buts, no New Year's Eve, no Macon.
God!
dear Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood...
guess what? You're gonna be grandparents
exclamation point.
why don't you try telling Michael's parents what you really feel?
Macon Land.
happy New Year.
happy New Year.
Hey, Macon, the man.
Hi.
the party's just arrived. - The party has--l'm here.
Yeah. - Okay. Hold still.
sorry.
now, you are pretty.
come on, you can smile better than that.
what? She doesn't know how to smile?
maybe she doesn't want to.
well, excuse me for breathing.
Yeah, you're breathing too close.
sorry about this. - lt's okay.
happy New Year. - Happy New Year.
here's to the new year, right?
Yeah, right. To the--to the new year.
okay, knock-knock. Police raid.
Hey, Macon, my man...what's up?
what's up with you?
I lost my damn earring.
Hey, Macon.
Hi, Halley.
Hi.
Thanks.
nice name.
who wants to see my ferret?
dude, I have one. Come on, dude.
I put a little hat on him and everything. It's awesome.
so, when's Scarlett due, anyway?
you know?
Yeah, my mom's a bookkeeper in her doctor's office, but...don't worry. I haven't told anyone.
third week of May.
God, that is so freaky.
you know, it's weird, but...
I didn't even know they had hooked up.
Really? They went out all summer.
did they?
Yeah, and he was completely in love with her.
she's ruining her life, you know.
I think l'd kill myself before I had a baby.
I know enough to know I wouldn't be able to handle it.
you're probably right, because you're not Scarlett.
right.
thank God for that.
what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Halley, where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I really am.
what was that all about?
I thought you wanted us to be together.
I do--but, " together " ?
it's so official and so big for us.
maybe you should just say what you feel for once.
I could do that.
I can.
I can.
I felt like I had to get out of there because I might...
really...
care about you, and...
and it scared me so much because that meant that...
you could hurt me.
or maybe I just didn't feel ready.
to like someone...that much.
and I like you.
don't make it so complicated, Halley.
some people fall in love.
I had to crash into it.
Hey, Baby.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
you gave us quite a scare.
God.
and I ruined your party, too.
I'm not concerned with the party.
your date with Steve. I know that was so important to you.
Halley, I know you were with Macon Forrester.
mom, it was not his fault, though.
we were trying to leave this really bad party.
he was letting me drive-- you know l'm like the worst driver, and I could not even see
Halley, save your strength. You're gonna need it to come up with better excuses.
Macon wasn't there when I woke up.
Macon wasn't there when I left.
Macon wasn't there the whole next week at school.
what do you expect when you break your own rules?
any word from him?
no.
I guess that's what guys are good at, right?
disappearing?
Hey. I'm back.
you really don't get it, do you?
I'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.
Oh, my...are you okay?
Hi, Halley.
I think I just dropped my keys.
no, they're in the door. Come on.
stop spinning! Stop spinning.
I'm not spinning!
quiet!
maybe you should be quiet.
that's what you should do.
upstairs.
Oh, Halley, you're such a good sister.
you think l'm doing those? I am not doing those.
be careful.
Christ, Halley. It's all right.
this is my bachelorette party.
I am a bachelorette.
thank you, little sister.
you are the greatest.
okay, Ashley, please just take this.
Jesus. What
you just...
please. Come on. Mom is upstairs sleeping.
mom's not home.
Really? And how would you know that?
friday night she sneaks out to have sex with Steve.
she told you that?
she didn't want you to know.
God, why do people think that I can't handle the truth?
go on, you hatchet-faced scarecrow!
you baboon!
you bag of bones! - You old weasel face!
sourpuss! - Sorry old flabby nincompoop!
top of the morning to you.
how is she?
sweetie.
a hangover kit.
not to appear superior, but I did limit myself to one glass of champagne, thank you very much.
if it wasn't for Halley, I would've died, probably.
no, you just would've woken up on the porch.
bet the neighbors would've loved that.
right, especially with the men's underwear around her neck.
underwear?
it was nothing. It was stupid.
underwear is not nothing.
no, they were pretty much nothing.
we promised each other no strippers.
I know, Lewis, I know, but I was at the mercy of my friends.
don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
of course they mean something, Lewis.
God, don't be so uptight!
Oh, l'm uptight? I'm not uptight!
Yes, Lewis, you are. You are uptight.
you know what else? Halley was right about you.
you have got a broomstick up your butt.
I never said that!
okay, well, guess who put it there?
don't talk to me that way. Maybe l'll find somebody fun!
to tell the truth, you're no fun!
we made a promise to each other, but you don't keep it because you're self-absorbed.
don't talk to me that way.
hello. Good morning, Halley.
what's going on? - I think they're breaking up.
relax. You're no fun.
marriage is a promise, and a promise has to be kept.
not every argument leads to a breakup.
for real!
the wedding is off.
l've been trying to say l'm sorry. - l'm sorry doesn't always cut it, Macon!
I couldn't stay with you at the hospital.
I know I should have, but think how much more freaked out your mom would've got if she'd have seen me.
Oh, my God.
okay. Wow, thank you so much.
so, you were ditching me for my own benefit.
no, that's not it.
I didn't ditch you.
I
okay, l...
I freaked out.
I'm not used to feeling this way about somebody.
and I just...
I couldn't believe I almost lost you, too.
here. Come on, l'll help you eat them.
no. I don't want any.
I can't see you anymore.
your mom will get over it.
it's not my mom. It's me.
and, of course, if you do decide to get married,
I can get my makeup and hair people to do you on the big day.
if you decide not to get married,
I think you should let them do some work on you anyway, because you are gonna want to look your best when you get back out there.
darling, there is nothing wrong with canceling a wedding.
no, it's indefinitely postponed.
that's what we're supposed to say officially.
my mom found out.
actually, I haven't really made up my mind yet, so if everybody could just
Oh, Honey.
give me a hug.
sweetie, you never know what's gonna happen. Okay?
for a while there, I thought l'd never get married.
finally, I had to put my foot down or my guy here would never have left
I'll get that.
Hello?
honey, it's their mother calling from Virginia.
it seems your grandmother had a bad fall.
your mother wants you to meet her there.
do you think she's okay in there?
it has been a while.
grandma, are you all right?
Yes, l'm just smoking a little marijuana.
look at that pattern.
is it just me, or is that the spitting image of Abraham Lincoln?
look, Halley, look. There's the mole.
Halley, you must see it!
you're the one who sees things no one else can see.
I do? - Yes.
mother, you're not supposed to be walking yet.
next time you fall like that, you're going to break your hip, then die.
you remember when we went to see our comet together?
Halley was too young to remember that.
no, I do remember.
you can't possibly. You remember hearing about it.
no, mom, I do remember.
why does no one trust me to know what I know anymore?
God.
God!
she doesn't even think that my own memories belong to me.
darling, she's your mother.
now, tell me about this fella of yours.
who told you about that?
grandma, it's really over.
first loves are never really over.
nobody's perfect, Sweetheart.
but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth your while.
Oh, boy! Do I have the munchies!
what about him? - He's not terrible looking.
Yeah, he's even cute in that geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.
Halley, it's...
it's Lewis.
Ashley, love of my life...
Iife of my heart...
once again...will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes. How crazy.
I can't believe it.
do it.
I owe you one.
for?
Macon's a really great guy.
see ya, Halley.
Hey. - Hi.
I had no idea that you guys were like hanging out.
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?
no, we're just
friends? - Yeah.
right.
no, it's fine because we had our thing, and it was fun... until it wasn't anymore, right?
no, that's not it.
when the going gets tough, it's best to just keep going, don't you think?
would you listen to me for a sec?
and to my bride.
thank you for showing me that socks don't need to be ironed...
that one needn't employ the Dewey decimal system for their CD collection...
and that, in the end, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference whether you start the toilet paper facing up or down.
despite what my parents taught me.
because, Ashley, you have shown me that life is worth embracing.
even if it means making a giant fool of yourself.
and lucky for me, you're willing to marry the guy who's been the biggest fool of all.
so here's to a lifetime of big, messy, wonderfully out-of-order moments with the most beautiful woman in the world
my bride.
your big sister is getting married in 3 1/2 hours.
you know if you get nervous, you can always...
you remember the sign.
of course. You taught it to me, remember?
so, you know. Just...
like that.
I'll do something. I'll yell, " fire, " okay?
okay. - Okay.
and we're back with the big dog of soft rock,
WDYG, 94 FM. " We dig the dog."
this is Daddy Dog himself, Len Martin, coming to you today on a very special day, 'cause one of my very own puppies--the eldest Ashley, is getting married.
Lorna, Honey, any words of wisdom coming from you, my very own newlywed?
waterproof mascara.
I'm gonna borrow yours, 'cause Daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby.
all right, let's kick off this Power Hour Of Love.
are you there? - Security?
Hey, give me--come on. This is my job!
my Halley?
I don't know how to get you to listen, but maybe
let him talk. - Just hear me out.
I suck with words.
but sometimes, words aren't the thing.
love isn't about words, it's about what you do.
and what I did...
running away, it was stupid.
we both know love's a big, scary, evil concept.
but if you feel it, it's gonna follow you around like a hungry dog no matter how far you run.
wait. I didn't mean to say love's a dog.
I just mean, l'm not going anywhere.
I love you, Halley.
if love beats us up, let's beat it up right back.
we could do this.
if you're ready to make the jump, l'll be right here to catch you.
and what a powerful Power Hour Of Love it has been.
this is Len Martin for WDYG, the Big Dog of soft rock.
that's right. Romance is in the air.
it's everywhere here today, folks.
this next song is going out to that young lady in question Miss Halley Martin and her big sister Ashley, 'cause Daddy loves you.
you look beautiful.
you look beautiful, Mom.
I'm not too old to wear pink?
no.
I look like a giant helium balloon.
come on. We have to go.
I'm gonna walk over.
I'll meet you there.
let's get Halley!
back seat. I need to lie down.
please be seated.
we have come together today to join in Holy Matrimony
Ashley Renee Martin and Lewis Gibson Warsher ll.
if any among you know any reason why this couple may not lawfully be married, declare it now or forever hold your peace.
do you, Lewis, promise to love, honor, and cherish Ashley from this day forward, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
and do you, Ashley, promise to love, honor, and cherish Lewis for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
the rings?
dear friends, let us ask God to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.
no. No, the other finger. That's right.
Ashley, Lewis... - She's having the baby.
it is now my delight... - Please be quiet.
...and honor to declare you husband and wife.
you may now kiss the bride.
she's having the baby. Now.
right now?
Scarlett's having the baby. I have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Scarlett's having the baby.
breathe.
wait, wait, wait! No.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
it's okay.
you're gonna have the baby!
thank you so much. Thanks.
you have got to do something. That was just a dreadful scene.
now the seating arrangement's gonna be a disaster.
one empty seat throws everything off.
mother, stop it. Okay?
it doesn't get any better than this.
squeeze my hand. It's okay. We're gonna get there.
I assume Daddy would like to be in the delivery room?
me? No, no. I
baby! - Mommy!
Hi, Sweetie. - I need you.
I'm her mother.
miss Smith? - lt's okay. Thank you.
don't leave me.
so, do you hate me?
not you, per se.
I hate the way your hair falls in your face.
and I hate the way your voice gets really low when you're serious.
and I hate the way you bite your bottom lip when you're nervous.
and the way your eyebrow goes--like that.
I hate that.
so, that's it?
you just hate the way I walk and talk and look?
no.
that Jedi mind trick thing?
I hate that.
don't give up on me.
I'm not.
but you are gonna regret ever having messed up.
cause l'm gonna make you pay for a long time.
but first...
you're going to take three steps towards me.
and you're going to wrap your arms around my waist.
washington, D.C.
Hey, got a couple bucks?
go away.
Hey, buddy.
you hear me?
right.
so this is a mugging, then, is it?
your money.
now.
Really?
look at how I'm dressed, mate.
how much money could you possibly think you're gonna get from me?
use your head.
give me your money.
and the watch.
you know, a man's watch is a very cherished thing.
you steal that, might as well be stealing his soul.
do yourself a favor, sweetheart.
run along.
now!
you'll have a hard time killing me with all these witnesses.
I don't care.
Oh, you care.
too much, actually.
you shoot me, those cops over there will start firing at you.
bystanders will get cut down by the crossfire.
people start falling off of the platforms onto the tracks.
be a veritable stam -- Stampede.
and even if you survive, I know you.
you'll be haunted forever.
the train gets here in four minutes, Baptiste.
next arrival: 4 minutes
soon as everyone boards, there'll be nobody left to get in the way.
what?
you gonna shoot me?
in cold blood?
you know, at might be worth hanging around for.
because I am really curious whether or not you still got it in you to do that.
well, I guess we'll find out, won't we?
next arrival: 3 minutes 8 hours earlier
not like him to leave a body just out in the open like this.
we weren't supposed to find it.
which one of you is Winston?
s. F. P. D. I'm Winston.
this is Seaver.
thanks so much for holding the scene for us.
M. O. seemed strange enough, I had to run it.
when I did, your name popped up from an old S. F. P. D. case.
John Doe, no I. D.
fingerprints appear to have been melted off by some sort of acid.
high-caliber entry wounds, no exit wounds.
coroner's gonna try to pull a slug to trace it.
he won't be able to.
this is a polymer-tipped, reverse-tapered jacket.
it's custom-made.
you won't find it at any gun shop.
left the ring, took the watch.
found the body in a dumpster?
Yeah.
total fluke we found it.
hobo over there went dumpster diving, came across it.
look, am I dealing with some kind of a serial killer here?
not exactly--our guy's an assassin for hire.
dispose of the body so that, even if it were found, wouldn't be able to I. D.
it for at least 24 hours.
he makes sure of that by dissolving the prints.
this guy has a thing for.
contingency plans.
and wristwatches.
it's Baptiste.
so if this is an assassin, isn't his job finished already?
Oh, no. He's just getting started.
thanks so much, detective.
call us if you find anything.
so.
we got an assassin that likes high-value targets, on the loose in a city full of high-value targets.
and he's got a six-hour head start.
told you he'd pop his head up again.
when he did -- I know, I know.
Hey, look, man, I know what this guy took from you.
I know what you want to do to him, And I don't think there's a person in the world who'd blame you for it.
but.
no buts.
whatever you want.
come on.
you!
me.
you look great.
what are you so dressed up for?
you're under arrest.
for what?
knocking on your door?
try obstruction of justice, for starters!
you were party to what happened at the embassy, and you fled!
there was no one to corroborate my story.
no one believed me!
what difference does it make?
we got the bad guy.
I was humiliated.
two-week suspension, loss of pay, permanent reprimand in my file.
I'm sorry.
is everything all right in there?
Hey, how's it going?
Emma, what's going on here?
everything's under control.
but can you grab my handcuffs?
they're in the bedroom chest, bottom drawer.
you keep your handcuffs in your -- Ohh!
shut up!
listen, this is fun and all.
but I've got a problem that's a little time sensitive.
so, Emma, looks like you're in the middle of something here.
thanks for understanding.
sorry, it's my job.
rain check for Saturday night.
Citronelle, my treat.
I'll call you!
can we talk about my thing now?
I wouldn't do that.
you turn me in, somebody very important dies tonight.
who's "someone very important"?
I don't know the target, but I know the assassin.
his name is Baptiste, And he's here in Washington tonight.
this is the case of a lifetime.
I'm just handing it to you.
give me couple minutes to explain.
prime minster of Argentina.
senator Stanton's plane crash about six years ago.
what do they have in common?
accidental deaths that were rumored not to have been so accidental.
not accidents.
flawless hits.
Baptiste hits.
that's why they're paying the big bucks.
he doesn't make mistakes.
there's no trail.
it's like he doesn't even exist.
what makes you so sure he's gonna strike tonight?
a John Doe shows up dead a few hours ago, one of Baptiste's custom-made bullets inside of him.
no I. D. fingerprints burned off.
he's wearing a huntsman's suit from Savile Row.
he's got a shirt from Bergdorf's on fifth avenue.
he's got a coat check slip from the Rose Cafe on 44th and First Ave.
44th and First?
you know what's across the street?
the United Nations.
Baptiste stole the identity of a European living in New York who works for the U. N.
so Baptiste killed him for access.
which means he is here to assassinate a foreign dignitary.
look, he's already got a head start.
his cover is airtight.
he's already dissected the patterns, the personnel, the vulnerabilities of the target's protection detail.
he's planned for every contingency you could imagine, and probably some that you can't.
he will not fail, unless we stop him.
so this guy's so good that he takes out heads of state and nobody even knows it was a murder.
he's a ghost.
somehow, you know that he's here.
you know his methods.
you know his resume.
how is it that no one else in the world knows this, but you do?
because I trained him.
I don't get you.
we were a good team.
and then you.
have to become all Dudley Do-Right.
nobody deserves to die.
everybody deserves to die.
as far as someone is concerned.
that's human nature.
and you taught me that.
I was wrong.
and then what do you do?
you turn around and you start some.
crusade.
to save people.
you don't even get the irony of it, do you?
the sad irony that, with all your effort, the people you cared most about saving, they're the ones that got hurt the worst.
and if there was ever any doubt about that, I think this evening's unfortunate events have put that to rest.
haven't they?
you trained an assassin? - Yeah
okay, and one would have to assume that in order to train an assassin, one would have to be an assassin.
look, that's not the point.
I'm trying to save somebody's life here.
the point is whether or not I can trust you.
I don't even know your damn name!
it's Christopher Chance.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're kind of running out of time.
I remember you from the embassy!
nice dress.
what the hell are you doing?
just unlock it.
hang that for me?
sure, why not?
are we all here now?
excuse me, it's kind of heavy. Going right there.
who the hell are all these people?
what is going on?
uh, Guerrero Winston, new girl.
Layla.
there you go.
we ruined her company, thought we'd give her a shot.
least we could do.
this is Agent Barnes.
how you doing?
I'm gonna go ahead and set up right here.
stop. Wait. What are you talking about?
don't touch that!
you got any idea what Baptiste's plan is?
well, I was thinking it was some version of a West Point, but then there's no way he could get the uniform in time.
then I was thinking maybe a reverse lifeboat?
Yeah, um, listen.
about.
you want to make us a pot of coffee?
I saw the way you were looking at her at the embassy.
okay, this is all in your head.
sure it is.
listen, all I hope is that this woman has the good sense to keep you at arm's length and treat this case with the same kind of objectiv -- Oh, dear God.
looks like a teenage girl's locker.
she went a little heavy on the chin, don't you think?
this is an ongoing F. B. I. investigation.
do you mind?
what do you guys want from me?
how about the white list?
uh -- The white list?
uh, the minute-to-minute itinerary of visiting dignitaries.
I know what the white list is.
I don't have access to it.
deputy Director Lynch does.
and what do you want me to tell her?
that the ghost that I've been hunting since the russian embassy is in my apartment, and he says that there's an assassin who doesn't exist that's gonna kill somebody tonight, unless I stop it?
I think that's a terrible idea.
I was thinking we just break into her office and take it.
you think I'm gonna help you break into the J. Edgar Hoover Federal building?
well, technically, your I. D. gets us into the federal building.
we just want to break into her office.
you're insane.
okay, listen.
I know I screwed you over at the embassy, and I'm sorry.
but do you really think I would risk being hauled off to jail if I didn't think that lives were in danger?
Baptiste is on the hunt.
he's got U. N. credentials.
this is not an accident.
protection of foreign diplomats is the job of the F. B. I. not the U. N.
exactly.
that's why he's gonna use his cover to convince somebody high up in U. N.
security that there's a threat, then he can.
gain access to the F. B.I.
yes? May I help you?
Mr. lecavalier...
...I'm sorry it has taken us so long to finally meet in person.
I trust Pauline and Claire are well?
when last we talked, The twins were just starting university, no?
Yes, they're very well.
okay, so I have some grave news.
I have discovered a security breach in operation olive branch.
this operation is classified, eyes only.
I'm the only one at the U. N. that's supposed to know about it.
and I only learned of it a few days ago.
I came across an intercept of an unnamed assassin.
he was hired out of Europe, And olive branch is his target.
why did you wait so long to inform me of this?
it took a while to confirm my intelligence.
I had to be certain, no?
I have to alert the F. B. I. immediately.
of course.
Jean Lecavalier for Deputy Director Lynch on a matter of urgent importance.
Yes.
thank you.
hopefully, we're not too late.
director Lynch.
I have Rene Dupont here.
he's from our New York office.
he has brought to light some legitimate concerns regarding this evening's operation.
Yes.
in person would be best.
we are leaving right now.
we have to go quickly.
Oh, I don't need to bother you with this any further.
no, no, this is the way it's done.
that is a very nice watch.
J. Edgar Hoover federal building
Hey, Tim.
s. F. P. D. just have to run through some mug shots with him.
detective Seaver.
okay.
you need to leave the case here, detective.
Thanks. There you go.
uplink confirmed
okay, we are in their network.
gonna link you up to the security feed.
and then I'm gonna work on the card readers.
so I'm looking at what they're looking at, live?
impressed yet?
getting in's the easy part, guys.
getting them out again, that's what separates the pros from the amateurs.
that's not yours.
Yeah, good luck getting through to him.
this your first time freelancing?
Why?
Oh, here we go.
well, we don't get benefits, there is no job security, and nobody gives you a cake on your birthday.
freedom.
whatever's in the fridge is fair game.
Yes, chapter one of the freelancer's manifesto.
how not to get invited back.
industry standard, dude.
FBI firewall protected
define "uh-oh."
I think they know I'm here.
bitlocker drive encryption -- process stopped
okay.
Yeah, they definitely know I'm here.
trying to get through my firewall.
unraveling my traceback redirects.
thought you said you knew what you were doing.
didn't your old outfit, Sentronics, help design the F. B. I security architecture?
turns out the F. B. I. has made some upgrades since then.
okay, I can hold them off.
but it's gonna slow everything else down.
what are we waiting for?
lynch is on the sixth floor, right?
if I push that button, there's no turning back.
aiding and abetting a known fugitive, trespassing on federal property.
breaking and entering on federal property.
violation of the espionage act of 1917, and conspiracy to commit treason.
could you be a little more dramatic?
so what was that -- your third, fourth date, something like that?
excuse me?
that guy in your apartment.
Roger. - Right.
and I'm fairly certain that's none of your business.
sorry.
what makes you think it was a third date?
nothing.
didn't sound like nothing.
your bra.
my what?
Yeah, it was like a third-date bra.
it was black with the little lacey thingy.
it was the kind of bra that looked like it was going to be making an appearance.
I noticed it when you were assaulting me.
it was a first date.
rene Dupont to see Deputy Director Lynch.
okay.
okay.
elevator's over there.
sixth floor, sir.
you know what never made any sense to me?
when you left.
it wasn't for principles.
or money.
it was for a girl.
Carrie or Kelly or - Her name was Katherine.
that's right. Katherine.
and you took it so personally.
like you really thought I took some pleasure out of killing her.
you gotta believe me, mate, it was completely the opposite.
I was embarrassed.
cause we'd always had each other's back, and then there I was, cleaning up your mess.
I can see how that'd be difficult for you.
you gotta tell me.
how does a man throw away everything for a woman that he barely knows?
I've lost sleep trying to make sense of it.
and then here we are, six years later, and you've done exactly the same thing.
I hope there's not gonna be any hard feelings this time.
because what happened to Agent Barnes.
that's entirely on you, mate.
you brought her into this.
not me.
I'm beginning to think this is a really bad idea.
speaking of bad ideas, that whole "you're under arrest" thing, that was just to prove a point, right?
Yes, the point being you're a criminal and you belong in jail.
this is Lynch's section.
there shouldn't be anyone here.
Guerrero, how we doing on those permissions?
new girl - Layla.
Layla's almost got 'em transferred.
how long?
T. B. D. dude.
security's gonna figure out we're not supposed to be here.
he'll get it. Come here
listen, just a few things to recommend me.
I've got a decent taste in music.
I'm good with animals and kids.
I'm not a great cook, but I'm learning.
if you give me a few hours, I could just lay all this out for you.
maybe dinner.
I'm sorry, y - y -- you wanna go out on a date with me?
well, it's a little early now, but, I mean, if you're asking.
sure.
I'm not asking.
okay, tell him to try it again.
go ahead, Chance.
they're ready.
told you.
holy moly.
so much for no one being here.
Barnes, what are you doing here?
you're not on this detail.
were you read-on to protocol 337?
no.
exactly.
it's above your pay grade.
lynch assigned me last-minute.
who's this?
Oh, Patrick McManus, U.N. liaison.
just here to help out.
it's a restricted operation.
I'm gonna have to run him.
Yeah, of course.
you're not in the system, are you?
not yet.
Yeah, Chance, I'm on it.
get this back in the system, quick.
who's Patrick McManus?
he's a cover we've used before.
come on, we need you to get him into the security personnel database.
that's not nearly as easy as it sounds.
they know I'm here.
they'll find me in a few minutes.
Yeah, well, they're gonna shoot Chance in, like, 30 seconds, so I wouldn't worry about that right now.
that kind of pressure doesn't help.
I have complete faith in you.
they don't do covert protection details unless it's a big deal.
it's big enough to bring in Baptiste.
we just need to find out who they're protecting.
is that MacManus?
Yeah, just try all the variations.
they always mess it up.
they're calling this operation olive branch.
H-hour is midnight.
it goes till dawn.
sounds like a long meeting.
I have a theory.
you first.
the fax machine: Letter head from the Chinese embassy.
I heard an agent speaking in a Taiwanese dialect.
big protection detail -- something sensitive, secret, worthy of disrupting.
taiwan and China are having a secret meeting somewhere in D. C.
exactly.
we just got to figure out where.
he's good to go.
off the books meaning somewhere in the D. C.area.
be somewhere inconspicuous.
someplace they could close down quietly.
call it a gas leak or something, so nobody's paying attention.
I'm gonna call one of my guys down at Metro.
see if he's noticed any red flags.
good.
you know, I don't get it.
what would someone have to gain from attacking that meeting?
Yeah, why would anyone want to stop two countries that spend over $60 billion a year on defense from making peace?
they'll prep several sites for the meeting.
nobody but Lynch will know the final destination till right before midnight.
he's here.
you pull a gun in here, you'll be dead in three seconds.
what the hell is Barnes doing here?
I don't know.
she said she was clear.
not by my office.
excuse me.
he's on the run. Let's go.
get Barnes over here.
we should just come clean.
by the time we convince them, Baptiste will have completed his mission and moved on.
I gotta stop him.
you're either with me or not.
it's up to you.
chance, I just saw Baptiste leave the building.
he's in a silver sedan, headed east.
Baptiste must have gotten the address from Lynch somehow.
maybe we'll get lucky and they'll cancel the operation.
you gotta think it took years to get these guys to sit down together in the first place.
they're not gonna cancel unless it's absolutely necessary.
Baptiste is counting on that.
Hello?
I should really apologize.
this is.
inelegant.
and ordinarily, I'd never even consider indulging the impulse.
but there's something I really need to know, darling.
who the hell is this?
our mutual friend there.
he's fallen into some very self-destructive behavior.
and just as we got past the whole Jatherine Walters fiasco,
I'm really worried that he's going down the same road with you.
so I suppose what I'm asking, and you really must forgive me for prying, but are you two an item?
it's been a while, Baptiste.
speak of the devil.
we were just talking about you.
yeah?
maybe we should meet up and continue this conversation.
funny you should say that.
I was just thinking the same.
in all fairness.
we should be the ones angry at you.
he's using you.
he used me. It's...
what he does.
used you?
the old man took you in when you had nothing.
he taught you a trade.
he treated us both like we were sons, and what did you do?
you betrayed him.
but it wasn't enough just to leave, was it?
you had to take that name.
that name.
you broke his heart.
I should have broke more than that.
see, me he respects.
but you were his favorite.
and when you left.
he took it very badly.
how do you think that was for me?
trying to figure out what the hell happened to you while trying to keep him in check.
it was exhausting.
you should have let me finish it.
Yeah, obviously.
because now, I'm gonna have to hear it all over again.
what a hothead you are -- making it all personal.
trying to provoke him.
trying to get him to come after you.
seriously, I mean, which one is it?
have you really changed?
do you have a death wish?
or did you just lose your edge?
Barnes, wake up.
let's go, come on.
chance, you all right?
Winston, yeah, we're okay.
we just got t-boned by Baptiste at the corner of Capital and E.
heading to you now.
all right.
if you could hack into the phone company's operations database, could you get the numbers to all the disposable cell phones activated in the past week?
sure, yeah.
um, why would we want to do that?
Baptiste uses burners when he's on the job.
if we could find the one he's using right now, I could call and maybe get him to give away his position.
you do realize there's got to be thousands of those things activated in a week?
but only one that just called agent Barnes.
Hey, mate.
Hello, dude.
it's been a while.
Yeah, hey, uh.
funny story.
a while big this, uh, skinny thug blackmailed me to get dirt on Chance.
guy wouldn't tell me who he worked for, so I.
I killed him.
any Chance you're the one holding the leash?
no.
it wasn't me.
your boss, then?
listen, I'm a little busy here, as I'm sure you'd appreciate.
so no offense.
Hey, no offense at all.
in fact, that's what I'm calling about.
business proposition.
10% of tonight's take to guarantee your success.
I'm guessing, what, seven figures?
I'm sorry.
are you saying that you're willing to betray our old friend?
in this economy, whatever pays the bills, dude.
anyone else, then, yeah.
but he's the one person that you would never turn against.
not yet, anyway.
not until you've lost everything.
Oh, by the way, I never got a chance to congratulate you on becoming a family man.
how old is the little one right now?
you know, when we're finished with you, you're gonna beg to return to the fold.
doesn't look like he gave anything away.
actually, he did.
okay.
it's time for you to finally start giving me some answers.
you know everything I do.
the guy kills people for money.
we gotta stop him. It's that simple.
who's Katherine Walters?
I used to work for some bad people.
I gathered that.
my old boss, he found me when I was young.
angry, alone.
and then he used it.
he told me that what I was doing was right.
that the person on the other side of the gun deserved it.
you know, for a long time, I believed it.
who's Katherine Walters?
she was the last assignment of an old life.
and I couldn't do it.
why not?
she was kind.
she was honest.
she didn't deserve it.
you loved her.
and I tried to protect her, but.
the guy they sent next was just too good.
Baptiste.
if that doesn't make you believe in karma.
let's go!
come on.
apparently, Guerrero got a hold of Baptiste's number, and he called him.
how'd he get that?
looks like that Layla's working out.
new girl.
anyway, wherever Baptiste was, Guerrero said he heard church bells ringing in the background.
church bells?
see, that list you're looking at came from my buddy in Metro.
list of red flags in the area tonight.
only one location where there could be church bells.
Georgetown.
methane leak reported, Sanford Hall.
they'd have evacuated the entire area of campus.
perfect spot for a secret summit.
we're there in five minutes.
what are you doing?
hey there.
dispatch called in a problem with the transformers on the south side.
secret service ordered these covers welded shut!
and if there was a problem, I'd be the guy to call it in.
Really?
Yeah, that's a good point.
I suppose the good news is, one way or another, I'm gonna get some answers.
have you really completely changed?
become a whole, new man?
or is my old friend still in there somewhere?
your old friend would have put a bullet in you for what you did.
with complete disregard for the consequences, heh.
you know what's great is if I kill you now, there are no consequences.
I walk away, and this is over.
Oh, we both know better than that.
you kill me, all bets are off.
the old man is coming after you.
he will go after everyone, Everyone you have ever cared about.
he'll burn the city to the ground.
and you know it.
this is the blue line to Franconia-Springfield.
next stop, Arlington.
I hope this is it,'cause we're running out of options.
this is it, right here.
the welding on this manhole cover, it's been removed.
that's how he got in.
how do you know that?
security's so top heavy, there's no way he could have gotten in there without being seen.
that's what I'd do.
coming?
where are you going?
upstairs.
I'm gonna find the security detail, give them Baptiste's description, get them to clear the windows in case he takes a shot.
Nah, he won't.
target this big, this much security, he needs to be thorough.
he needs to take everyone out all at once.
he needs to.
blow up the building.
look at this.
it's ethylene oxide.
extremely flammable, odorless.
he's got it hooked up to the gas system.
that looks booby trapped.
that's probably a safe bet.
it's got a remote trigger.
we need to get Lynch and get everybody out of the building.
where are you going?
the only place with a clean line of sight and a good, strong cell reception.
agent Barnes.
we need to clear the building now.
the operation's been compromised.
we need to get everyone in that delegation out of here.
you've got a lot to answer for.
we need to evacuate.
no, you need to explain what in God's name you are doing here before I have you arrested.
all stations, check in.
grounds one, roger.
grounds two, roger.
spotter one, roger.
we are aware of the threat against this summit.
we have taken all the necessary precautions.
a rep from the U. N. debriefed me on this an hour ago.
the man you met earlier was not Rene Dupont.
he's an assassin named Baptiste.
the set this entire building to blow.
you have been increasingly erratic, ever since that fiasco at the russian embassy.
you're done.
put her under arrest and get her out of here, now.
send one of your men to the boiler room.
you're making a huge mistake!
ma'am, it's true.
I saw it myself.
okay.
clear the building.
now!
do we have a head count?
48
one short.
someone's still inside.
did everyone make it out of the building?
Barnes?
she went back to make sure it was clear.
I'm sorry, man.
Where's Baptiste?
he's gone.
Guerrero had Layla hack the phone company.
track all the calls Baptiste made in the last 12 hours.
the last call he made was to Amtrak.
that's his escape route.
I know, I'm on it, dude.
Hey, check out all the nearest subway stations that are closest -- Georgetown.
I know, I'm on it.
which way did Chance go? - south
Rosslyn station. Next closest one is Foggy Bottom, to the east.
all right, I'll take that.
Hey, and make sure that you -- scan the emergency channels.
I know, dude.
like I said, you'll get the hang of it.
you know, I wrenched my knee a little bit.
bruised my thigh.
along with the bullet in the arm and the knife in the chest.
but I can still run okay, If that's what you were wondering.
I'm just not going to.
although I think that you're hoping I do.
begging me to do something.
make a move for you.
make a run for it.
anything to give you the excuse to shoot me without it being in cold blood.
but you know what?
I don't think I'm gonna make it that easy for you.
you got the power now.
you can resolve this once and for all.
is it true that no one deserves to die?
or does that always get decided by the guy who holds the gun?
so this is it?
the moment of truth.
it's over, Baptiste.
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.
she made it out.
back entrance.
delegate took a little shrapnel, but other than that, he's okay, as is everyone else.
bollocks. - I got him.
H. R. T. 's on the way, place is surrounded.
it's over.
not for me.
Yeah, just give a second here, please, darling.
you shut up!
put the gun down.
this isn't you, not anymore.
you keep telling yourself that you've changed, and that people don't deserve to die.
but you and me, we both know the truth.
you've lost your edge.
works out perfectly for me, But it's really sad for you.
take this one in.
shackles and shotguns, double detail.
none of this Metro crap.
he's in federal custody as of this moment.
who's this?
he's with me.
get him out of here.
see ya.
I'm glad you're okay.
I, uh, I gotta get to work.
arrest of a lifetime and all.
thank you.
about that.
dinner.
we're done here. You don't have to do that.
Oh, I don't have to.
so.
is it always like this?
like what?
well, it's certainly -- It's more stressful than my old gig.
but.
we saved all those people.
we got an assassin.
I don't know.
it was -- it was fun.
it was fun?
Yeah.
that's just the adrenaline in your system.
you're gonna crash later.
this line of work, there's nothing worse than the highs and lows.
nothing's ever what you think it is.
nothing's ever over.
Ooh, matey.
that's a nice watch.
until now.
I am a vampire.
and this is my story.
an hour's drive to hear that crap.
you know, it wasn't even a band.
a guy with a guitar.
an hour each way.
he wasn't that bad.
he sounded like James Blunt.
what's wrong with that?
we already have a James Blunt.
one's all we need.
so why did you come?
because I love you.
nicely done.
what's with all the fog?
it'll clear in a second.
watch out!
are you ok?!
we just hit someone! Oh, my god!
call for help.
come on, come on!
please be alive!
Oh, my god.
there's no signal!
Darren!
Darren?
I shouldn't have come home.
I know the risk.
but I had no choice.
I have to know her.
dear diary, today will be different.
it has to be.
I will smile, and it will be believable.
my smile was "I'm fine, thank you."
Yes, I feel much better.
I will no longer be the sad little girl who lost her parents.
I will start fresh, be someone new.
it's the only way I'll make it through.
toast. I can make toast.
it's all about the coffee, Aunt Jenna.
is there coffee?
your first day of school, and I'm totally unprepared.
lunch money?
I'm good.
anything else?
a number two pencil? What am I missing?
don't you have a big presentation today?
I'm meeting with my thesis advisor at now.
crap!
then go. We'll be fine.
you ok?
don't start.
so gram's telling me I'm psychic.
our ancestors were from Salem, which isn't all that, I know, crazy, but she's going on and on about it, and I'm like, put this woman in a home already!
but then I started thinking, I predicted Obama and I predicted Heath Ledger, and I still think Florida will break off and turn into little resort islands.
Elena!
back in the car.
I did it again, didn't I?
I--I'm sorry, Bonnie.
you were telling me that...That I'm psychic now.
right. Ok, then predict something.
about me.
I see...
what was that?!
Oh, my god!
Elena, are you ok?
it's ok. I'm fine.
it was like a bird or something. It came out of nowhere.
really, I can't be freaked out by cars for the rest of my life.
I predict this year is going to be kick ass.
and I predict all the sad and dark times are over and you are going to be beyond happy.
major lack of male real estate.
look at the shower curtain on Kelly Beach.
she looks a hot.
can I still say "tranny mess"?
no, that's over.
ahh, find a man, coin a phrase.
it's a busy year.
he hates me.
that's not hate.
that's "you dumped me, but I'm too cool to show it," "But secretly I'm listening to Air Supply's greatest hits."
Elena. Oh, my god.
how are you?
Oh, it's so good to see you.
how is she? Is she good?
Caroline, I'm right here.
and I'm fine. Thank you.
Really?
Yes. Much better.
Oh, you poor thing.
OK, Caroline.
OK, see you guys later?
OK! - Bye.
no comment.
I'm not going to say anything.
don't take more than two in a six-hour window.
Hey, Vicki.
I knew I'd find you here with the crackheads.
Hey, Pete Wentz called.
he wants his nail polish back.
Pete Wentz, huh? How old school T. R.L of you.
Carson Daly fan?
Oh, Ty, be nice. Be nice.
that's Elena's little brother.
I know who he is.
I'll still kick his ass.
hold up. Who's this?
all I see is back.
it's a hot back.
your records are incomplete.
you're missing immunization records, and we do insist on transcripts.
please look again.
I'm sure everything you need is there.
well, you're right.
so it is.
I'm sensing Seattle, and he plays the guitar.
you're really going to run this whole psychic thing into the ground, huh? - Pretty much.
I'll be right back.
please be hot.
Whoa! Pants down, chick!
great.
it's the first day of school and you're stoned.
no, I'm not. - Where is it?
is it on you? - Stop, all right!
you need to chill yourself, all right?
chill myself? - What is that, stoner talk?
dude, you are so cool.
look, stop! I don't have anything on me. Are you crazy?
you haven't seen crazy, Jeremy!
I gave you a summer pass, but I am done watching you destroy yourself.
no, no, no, you know what?
go ahead. Keep it up. But just know that I am going to be there to ruin your buzz every time, you got it?
Jeremy, I know who you are.
and it's not this person.
so don't be this person.
I don't need this.
thank you.
you're welcome.
uh, pardon me.
is this the men's room?
Yes. um, I was just. Um... I was just...
it's a long story.
thank you.
once our home state of Virginia joined confederacy in 1861, it created a tremendous amount of tension within the state.
people in Virginia's northwest region had different ideals than those from the traditional deep south.
then virginia divided in 1863 with the northwest region joining the union.
dear diary, I made it through the day.
I must have said, "I'm fine, thanks," at least 37 times.
and I didn't mean it once.
but no one noticed.
when someone asks, "How are you"?
they really don't want an answer.
Hi, bird.
that's not creepy or anything.
that's what I thought.
you ok?
were you following me?
no, I, uh, I just... I saw you fall.
Uh-huh, and you just happened to be hanging out in a cemetery.
I'm visiting. I have family here.
Wow. Tactless.
I'm sorry. It's the fog,
it's making me foggy.
and then back there, there was this bird, and it was all very Hitchcock for a second.
that is the bird movie, right, the Hitchcock?
I'm Elena.
I'm Stefan.
I know.
we have history together.
and English and French.
right.
Thanks.
nice ring.
it's a family ring, yeah.
I'm kinda stuck with it. It's weird, huh?
no, no. It's just, I mean, there are rings and then there's that.
did you hurt yourself?
did you hurt yourself?
I don't know.
Oh! Look at that.
that is not pretty.
you ok?
you should go.
take care of that.
really, it's nothing.
I lost control today.
everything I've kept buried inside came rushing to the surface.
I'm simply not able to resist her.
working.
Thanks, Vick.
do you need another refill?
I'd love one.
please tell me you're not hooking up with my sister.
I'm not hooking up with your sister.
you're such a dick.
Hey, what's your deal?
I mean, summer you act one way and then school starts and you can't be bothered.
look, Jeremy, I really appreciate all the pharmaceuticals, but you can't keep following me around like a lost puppy.
when's the last time you had sex with a puppy?
Hey, keep it down. I don't want to tell the whole world
I deflowered Elena's kid brother.
Yeah, and deflowered and deflowered.
we hooked up a few times in a drug haze. It's over.
you gotta back off before you ruin things between me and Tyler.
Oh, come on, the guy's a total douche.
he only wants you for your ass.
yeah?
what do you want me for?
his name is Stefan Salvatore.
he lives with uncle up at the old Salvatore boarding house.
he hasn't lived here since he was a kid.
military family, so they moved around a lot.
he's a gemini, and his favorite color is blue.
you got all of that in one day?
Oh, please, I got all that between third and fourth period.
we're planning a June wedding.
I'm meeting Bonnie at the grill.
OK, have fun. Wait, I got this.
don't stay out late, it's a school night.
well done, aunt Jenna.
sorry, I was about to knock.
I wanted to apologize for my disappearing act earlier.
I know it was strange.
no worries.
I get it, blood makes you squeamish.
um, something like that.
how's your leg?
Oh, it's fine.
just a scratch, barely.
how did you know where I lived?
it's a small town.
I asked the first person I saw.
um, I thought you might want this back.
Oh, I must have dropped it.
I thank you.
don't worry, I didn't read it.
no?
why not? Most people would have.
well, I wouldn't want anyone to read mine.
you keep a journal?
Yeah, if I don't write it down, I forget it.
memories are too important.
Yeah.
I'm just gonna...
um, you don't have to stay out there.
I'm fine.
sorry, were you going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm meeting a friend.
do you want to come?
how's Elena doing?
her mom and dad died. How do you think?
she's putting on a good face, but it's only been four months.
has she said anything about me? - Oh, no.
so not getting in the middle.
you pick up the phone and call her.
I feel weird calling her.
she broke up with me.
give it more time, Matt.
more time, huh?
Hey, I'm Matt, nice to meet you.
Hi. Stefan.
so, you were born in Mystic Falls?
Mm-hmm, and moved when I was still young.
parents?
my parents passed away.
I'm sorry.
any siblings?
none that I talk to.
I live with my uncle.
so, Stefan, if you're new, then you don't know about the party tomorrow.
it's a back to school thing at the Falls.
are you going?
of course she is.
you promised.
this was an animal attack.
don't give me that. I know the game.
you tear them up enough, they always suspect an animal attack.
you said you had it under control.
and I do.
please, uncle Stefan.
mystic Falls is a different place now.
it's been quiet for years, but there are people who still remember.
and you being here, it's just going to stir things up.
it's not my intention. - Then what is?
why did you come back?
after all this time, why now?
I don't have to explain myself.
I know that you can't change what you are.
but you don't belong here anymore.
where do I belong?
I can't tell you what to do.
but coming back here was a mistake.
the battle of Willow Creek took place right at the end of the war in our very own mystic falls.
how many casualties resulted in this battle?
ms. Bennett?
um...A lot?
I'm not sure.
like a whole lot.
cute becomes dumb in an instant, Ms. Bennett.
Mr. Donovan.
would you like to take this opportunity to overcome your embedded jock stereotype?
it's ok, Mr. Tanner, I'm cool with it.
hmm. Elena?
surely you can enlighten us about one of the town's most significantly historical events?
I'm sorry, I... I don't know.
I was willing to be lenient last year for obvious reasons, Elena, but the personal excuses ended with summer break.
there were 346 casualties, unless you're counting local civilians.
that's correct.
mister...
Salvatore.
Salvatore. any relation to the original settlers here at mystic falls?
distant.
well, very good.
except, of course, there were no civilian casualties in this battle.
actually, there were 27, sir.
confederate soldiers, they fired on the church, believing it to be housing weapons.
they were wrong.
it was a night of great loss.
the founder's archives are, uh, stored in civil hall if you'd like to brush up on your facts.
Mr. Tanner.
what do you mean, you never hooked up?
people look up to me.
I have to set an example.
just admit it, Elena.
Oh, ok, so he's a little pretty.
he has that romance novel stare.
Stefan looked deep into her eyes, piercing her very soul.
Hey! you made it!
I did.
well, let's get you a drink.
well, I'm... - Oh, come on.
so where is he?
I don't know.
you tell me, you're the psychic one.
right, I forgot. Ok, so give me a sec.
grams says I have to concentrate.
wait, you need a crystal ball.
ta da.
what?
that was weird.
when I touched you, I saw a crow.
what?
a crow.
there was fog, a man.
I'm drunk.
it's the drinking. There's nothing psychic about it.
yeah? Ok, I'm gonna get a refill.
OK.
Bonnie!
I did it again, didn't it?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
you're upset about something.
no, it's Bonnie. she's...
you know what?
never mind. You're...here.
I'm here.
you know, you're kind of the talk of the town.
am I? - Mm-hmm.
mysterious new guy, oh, yeah.
well, you have the mysterious thing going, too.
twinged in sadness.
what makes you think that I'm sad?
well, we did meet in a graveyard.
right.
well, no, technically we met in the men's room.
you don't want to know, it's...It's not exactly party chit-chat.
well, I've never really been very good at, uh, chit-chat.
last spring my parents' car drove off of a bridge into the lake.
and I was in the backseat and I survived, but they didn't.
so that's my story.
you won't be sad forever, Elena.
no, Ty.
I'm not having sex against a tree.
Oh, come on, it would be hot. - For who?
no, it's not going to happen.
it's not going to happen, not here, not like this.
no. I said no.
I said no! Wow, that hurts!
Hey, leave her alone.
you know, you're starting to get on my nerves, Gilbert.
just go, Tyler, get the hell away from me.
Wow. Vicki Donovan says no.
that's a first.
I didn't need your help.
it seems like you did.
he was just drunk. - I'm drunk.
am I throwing myself at you?
no, you're worse.
you want to talk to me, get to know me, see into my soul and screw and screw and screw until you're done with me.
is that what you think?
that's what I know.
I like Bonnie, she seems like a good friend.
best friend in the world. - And Matt, he can't seem to, uh, take his eyes off of us.
Matt's that friend since childhood that you start dating because you owe it to yourselves to see if you can be more.
And?
and then my parents died, and everything changes.
anyway, Matt and I, together we just, I don't know, it wasn't, um...It wasn't...
passionate.
no.
no, it wasn't passionate.
Hey, um, are you ok?
your eye, it just, it's...
Yeah, no. It's, um, it's nothing.
um, are you thirsty?
I'm gonna get us a drink.
Jeremy?
is that you?
Jeremy?
looking for someone?
when you broke up with me, you said it was because you needed some time alone.
you don't look so alone to me.
Matt, you don't understand. It's...
that's ok, Elena.
you do what you have to do.
I just want to let you know that...
I still believe in us.
and I'm not giving up on that.
Matt.
Hey! There you are.
have you been down to the falls yet?
because they are really cool at night.
and I can show you, if you want.
I think you've had too much to drink.
well, of course I have.
so, Caroline.
you and me, it's not gonna happen.
sorry.
I was wondering who abducted you, but now I know.
is she like that with, uh, all the guys?
no.
you're fresh meat.
she'll back off eventually.
God, you gotta be kidding me!
what is it?
my brother. - The drunk one?
that would be the one.
excuse me. - Need some help?
trust me, you're not going to want to witness this.
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Jeremy, where the hell are you going?
I don't want to hear it!
Vicki? No!
Oh, my god, it's Vicki! Oh, my god!
No!
somebody help!
Vicki? Vicki, what the hell?!
what happened to her?
somebody, call an ambulance!
everybody back up, give her some space!
it's her neck. Something bit her.
she's losing a lot of blood.
put this on her neck.
Vicki, Vicki, come on, open your eyes, look at me.
what's going on?
someone else was attacked tonight, Zach, and it wasn't me.
Damon.
Hello, brother.
crow's a bit much, don't you think?
wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
When'd you get here?
well, I couldn't miss your first day at school.
your hair's different.
I like it.
it's been 15 years, Damon.
thank god.
I couldn't take another day of the Nineties.
that horrible grunge look?
did not suit you.
remember, Stefan, it's important to stay away from fads.
why are you here?
I miss my little brother.
you hate small towns.
it's boring. There's nothing for you to do.
I've managed to keep myself busy.
you know, you left that girl alive tonight.
that's very clumsy of you.
that can be a problem for you.
why are you here now?
I could ask you the same question.
however, I'm fairly certain your answer can be summed up all into one little word...
Elena.
we're gonna go Mainline Coffee, wait for news.
I gotta take Jeremy home.
Elena, there's no way I'm psychic.
I know that.
but whatever I saw, or I think I saw, I have this feeling...
Bonnie, what?
that it's just the beginning.
she took my breath away.
Elena.
she's a dead ringer for Katherine.
is it working, Stefan?
being around her, being in her world?
does it make you feel alive?
she's not Katherine.
well, let's hope not.
we both know how that ended.
tell me something, when's the last time you had something stronger than a squirrel?
I know what you're doing, Damon. It's not gonna work.
yeah? Come on. Don't you crave a little?
stop it. Let's do it. Together.
I saw a couple girls out there.
or just, let's just cut to the chase, let's just go straight for Elena!
stop it!
imagine what her blood tastes like!
I can.
I said stop!
I was impressed.
I give it a six.
missing style, but i was pleasantly surprised.
very good with the whole face thing. It was good.
you know, it's all fun and games, Damon, huh?
but wherever you go, people die.
that's a given. - Not here.
I won't allow it.
I take that as an invitation.
Damon, please.
after all these years, can't we just give it a rest?
I promised you an eternity of misery, so I'm just keeping my word.
just stay away from Elena.
Where's your ring?
Oh, yeah, sun's coming up in a couple of hours, and, poof, ashes to ashes.
relax.
it's right here.
you should know better than to think you're stronger than me.
you lost that fight when you stopped feeding on people.
I wouldn't try it again.
I think we woke Zach up. hmm.
sorry, Zach.
you ok?
I called Jenna, she's on her way.
those people in uniforms, last time I checked, they're the police.
people are going to stop giving you breaks, Jer.
they just don't care anymore.
they don't remember that our parents are dead, because they've got their own lives to deal with.
the rest of the world has moved on.
you should try, too.
I've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary.
is that--Is that supposed to be you moving on?
mom and dad wouldn't have wanted this.
are you sober yet?
no.
keep drinking. I gotta get you home.
I gotta get me home.
why didn't he go for me?
you know, how come...
the guys that I want never want me?
I'm not touching that.
I'm inappropriate.
I always say the wrong thing.
and Elena always says the right thing.
she doesn't even try!
and he just picks her.
and she's always the one that everyone picks, for everything.
and I try so hard, and I'm never the one.
it's not a competition, Caroline.
Yeah, it is.
Vicki...
Hey.
Hey, it's ok.
you're gonna be ok.
Matt-- shh.
Hey, don't try to talk, ok?
you're fine.
vampire.
dear diary, I couldn't have been more wrong.
I thought that i could smile, nod my way through it; pretend like it would all be ok.
I had a plan.
I wanted to change who I was; create a life as someone new, someone without the past.
without the pain.
someone alive.
but it's not that easy.
the bad things stay with you.
they follow you.
you can't escape them, as much as you want to.
all you can do is be ready for the good.
so when it comes, you invite it in, because you need it.
I need it.
I know it's late.
but, uh...
I needed to know that you were ok.
you know, for months, that's all anyone's wondered about me.
if I'll be ok.
what do you tell them?
that I'll be fine.
do you ever mean it?
ask me tomorrow.
it's warmer in the house. We can talk.
would you like to come in?
Yes.
how much farther?
what?
are we almost done?
you want to stop?
no.
let's rest a while.
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.
you go ahead. I'll catch up.
I can wait.
Adam, please. It's your workout.
go. I'll meet you at the point.
you're out of shape, cheerleader.
Oh, yeah?
let's see you do 3 back flips and land in the splits.
the point?
the point.
Hello?
is somebody there?
if you're trying to scare me, I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my god. Adam, please wake up. Adam.
baby, please, baby. Please!
Noooo!
victim's the Loyd boy, isn't it?
the quarterback?
just saw his parents yesterday heading up to Nantucket.
listen get me their number up there, will you?
sheriff Bridges.
there's something here.
what is it?
you're gonna want to see this, sir.
looks like the head is busted open.
just like Adam Loyd.
you want me to get the crime scene folks down here?
Yeah.
wait. Hold on.
we're gonna need a lot more than the crime scene folks.
easy there, tough guy. Have some coffee with your sugar.
I need something to wake me up.
Ooh. Late night?
very.
my man.
not that kind of late night.
OK, so tell me, what does keep young Dr. Reid awake at night?
wait, let me guess.
memorizing some obscure textbook.
no, no, no, no.
working on cold fusion.
no, I got it.
watching Star Trek... and laughing at the physics mistakes.
actually, there aren't that many scientific errors in Star Trek.
especially considering how long ago it was made.
there are certain improbabilities, but not that many outright errors.
right.
Hey, Morgan?
uh, do you ever have dreams?
I'm sorry.
I guess nightmares would be a more accurate description.
is that what's keeping you up?
I used to get them occasionally but lately it's like I have them every night.
what are they about?
this. What we do.
do you have nightmares?
Reid, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for you to talk to about this.
why not?
it's just, uh...
did you ask Gideon about it?
no.
you should.
Hey, Hotch wants everyone in the round table room.
something up with you two?
no.
McAllister. Western slope of Massanutten mountain in Virginia.
2 bodies discovered in the woods both with apparent blunt trauma to the head.
skeletons?
one of them. The second victim was just killed this morning.
how do we know there's a connection?
they were found about 75 feet apart with nearly identical head wounds.
Where's the rest of the case file?
there isn't one. The sheriffs are on the scene waiting for us.
their location is only a half hour away by plane.
what's the rush?
well, there was evidence on the scene that could cause a bit of a public uproar.
a satanic cult.
so Peter Ustinov said, "unfortunately a super-abundance of dreams is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares.
JJ, we need to obviously, keep this out of the press for as long as possible.
I'll do what I can.
why is that so important?
there was a nationwide scare in the 1980s involving satanic ritual killings and abuse.
the satanic panic, it was called.
it began after the publication of a book about repressed memories being recovered through hypnotherapy.
memories of growing up with devil worshippers who use children in their rituals and ceremonies.
most of the claims were later found to be false or just impossible.
still, numerous therapists accepted the assertions as true and began searching for similar signs in their own patients.
after one year, thousands of people reported the exact same repressed memories.
the bureau conducted an investigation and concluded that most of the most of the ritual killings or abuse were more urban legend than anything else.
you're saying that there's no such thing as devil worship?
not at all.
but most of the satanism that we've seen is juveniles damaging property, desecrating churches, cemeteries.
to my knowledge, there has never been a proven case of a satanic ritual killing in the united states.
well, maybe there is now.
mornin'.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
I'm agent Jareau, and this is agent Gideon and Dr. Reid with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
Hi.
thanks for coming out so fast.
Yeah. Of course.
there was an in-service in Charlottesville last year said if we ran into any unusual homicides we were supposed to call you folks sooner rather than later.
Yeah, they were right.
is this unusual enough?
it certainly is interesting.
you guys must get a lot of this, huh?
satanic stuff?
not really.
who found the bodies?
a hiker found the first one at the trail and my deputies located this one while searching for evidence.
we don't even know if it's a man or a woman.
it's a man.
the male pelvis is more narrow and the opening at the bottom is heart-shaped, as opposed to oval.
melted wax?
candle wax?
candles are used in rituals.
they're also used on birthday cakes.
actually, they were originally used to protect the birthday celebrant from demons for the coming year.
as a matter of fact, down to the fourth century christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual.
what kind of doctor are you?
he was kind of a local hero.
a high school football star.
so a pretty strong kid, huh?
I know he used to run out here on the mountain all the time.
that's not easy.
was he out here running today?
he was wearing sweats.
a crime of opportunity or was the unsub laying in wait for this kid specifically?
unsub?
unknown subject. The killer.
if it is a cult, do you think they cared who the victim was?
maybe. Maybe not.
so we're talking about a blitz attack on a high-risk victim
one who could defend himself with a weapon picked up at the scene.
disorganized offender. It could be a cult.
the manson crime scenes were textbook disorganized murder.
this looks like a heavily traveled area.
a lot of the locals walk these paths.
some tourists, too.
if you are gonna conduct a ritual killing?
would you do it in the middle of a traveled path?
well, if the other crime scene was a ritual site where the pentagram is
I might blitz the victim here and drag him to the other scene.
why didn't they?
does "lod" mean anything to you?
Uh-uh. I don't know of any significance in satanism, either.
well, I could have Garcia research this "lod" thing if I could get a call out.
not much of a chance of that out here.
are there any cults in the area that you know about?
secret groups?
people you see you don't know much about people who stay to themselves mostly.
this is a very religious area.
church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.
if there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.
that's an inherent contradiction.
excuse me?
he means if there was a group being secretive you probably wouldn't know.
look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.
what I know is none of them are capable of doing this.
find anything interesting down there?
Yeah, it does look like some kind of ritual site.
have any of you ever heard the expression "lod" or the acronym "L. O.D."?
not me.
sheriff Bridges!
it's ok, Harris. Let her in.
was Adam Loyd killed out here?
who told you that, Veronica?
was he? My daughter was with him.
they were out running together this morning.
Oh, my god. I can't find her. Cherish is missing.
cherish is missing!
help me, please.
take her home.
we're looking for someone who can overpower our victim abduct a girl from a traveled path without being seen.
it certainly fits with the cult theory.
more than one unsub to control multiple victims.
but if the attack were ferocious enough a single unsub could, too.
kill Adam and grab the girl while she's in shock.
this is some rough country.
we only went 1/4 of a mile, and we almost got lost.
the unsub has to be from this area.
you don't just stumble onto a place like this.
JJ, where'd the sheriff go?
he's setting up a search party.
tell him I want him to use volunteers from the area. Locals.
do you want him to know why?
no, not yet.
is it wise to alienate him?
well, he thinks we're looking for a monster.
if we tell him we're looking for volunteers so we can profile who shows up he might call the whole thing off.
state won't be here for over an hour. We're not gonna wait.
I want you to gather everyone up and I'm going to assign grid locations.
Yes, sir.
you have a moment, sheriff?
I've got a missing girl, 100 square miles of woods, not enough men and in a couple of hours it's going to be dark.
have you considered using the people that live in the area?
I'm not gonna have civilians messing up the crime scene.
we can instruct them not to touch anything until a member of law enforcement arrives.
what if they get lost, too?
we can have them sign in to a volunteer sheet and keep track of what grid square they're in.
look...I grew up in a small town.
you have the state police coming in?
Yeah.
your locals can do a better job of finding this girl than any statie.
you know that.
you'll keep track of 'em?
I've coordinated searches all over the country.
let's go.
Harris, I'm going downtown.
don't do anything until I get back, all right?
Hey, can I come with you guys?
I need to call Quantico and have them research that whole "lod" thing.
Yeah, sure. Hop in.
what's happened, John?
Reverend Paul Burke, this is
I'm sorry, I forgot your names.
I'm agent Jareau. This is Dr. Reid.
they're with the FBI.
FBI? It's true, then? Adam's dead?
cherish Hanson's missing, too.
is there anything I can do?
actually, yes. We're putting together a search party.
could you call the congregation?
of course. Of course. I'll go make some calls.
Thanks, Reverend. This way.
use any phone, doc, you just dial 9 to get an outside line.
I've got an emergency phone list back here in my office.
did you play ball?
no.
Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, either, if not for my father.
I'm Cory.
who's that, nietzsche?
thus spake zarathustra" was rather antagonistic of the judeo-christian world view for this town, isn't it?
I don't think too many people here would've bothered to read it.
if they had, they wouldn't understand it.
might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory.
nobody ever got that reference before.
is my father around?
the sheriff?
he's in his office with another agent.
agent?
I'm with the FBI, behavioral analysis unit.
Profilers?
ha. This is mad cool.
I got, like 100 questions I go
wait. Why would FBI profilers be here in McAllister?
there was a murder outside of town on the mountain.
a murder?
a girl's missing.
it's Cherish, son.
we're putting together a search party.
I need you to get the rest of the team together and meet us out at the trail about 1/2 mile south of the point.
Yeah. Ok.
came as soon as I heard, sheriff.
good morning, Henry.
sign in with this lady here then just stand by for a few minutes.
everyone, please, as soon as you've signed in make your way back to the police cars.
that's where you'll be assigned your groups. Thank you.
I grew up in Brooklyn.
you couldn't get this many people out for anything less than free money.
well, here come the jocks and cheerleaders.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
now, you're all assigned grid squares to search.
each grid has a deputy or an FBI agent.
you find anything, do not touch it.
just let your grid leader know.
now, are there any questions?
all right. Everyone get in your group now.
all right, you guys, let's head out.
you have the sign-in sheets?
Yeah.
is Garcia standing by to do background on them all?
I got a deputy waiting to take me back to the station.
I'm gonna fax her soon as I get there.
good. This type of unsub can't resist injecting himself into a show like this.
he's here with us.
man, this is one peyton place of a town.
most everyone lives well above the median income of the country.
you got doctors, lawyers...
one guy owns a bunch of shoe stores up and down the eastern seaboard.
ha. Is he married?
Yeah. Story of my life, sunshine.
Reverend Paul Burke, looks like he became born again in prison.
prison?
Yeah, 2 years as a guest of the state of Ohio for embezzlement.
I'm seeing a lot of tax sheltering and various hanky-panky here but I'm not sure what would suggest potential satanic cult members hold on.
wait, you got something?
Yeah, I got a guy with a ton of debts spotty work history, his house is in foreclosure.
he's got a record, too assault with a deadly weapon 3 years ago.
wait. Does it say what the weapon was?
baseball bat.
our unsub used a blunt object.
bats are blunt, aren't they?
what's this guy's name?
OK. Here he is. "Grid b-5." Ok, that puts him with...Elle.
you all right there?
way to scare a girl.
saw you bent over.
I was tying my shoe.
these almost never come untied.
good for you.
my name's Henry.
well, then good for you, Henry.
I'm Elle.
like the letter?
that's a different kind of name.
had it all my life.
that's funny. Your whole life.
you're with the FBI, right?
that must be exciting.
it has its moments.
it's dangerous, too, right?
I mean, you go after killers and things.
really bad guys.
you ever have to shoot
Satan commands the virgin be sacrificed at the next full moon.
that's tonight, isn't it?
Wh--what's that?
blood.
tired?
I'm fine.
we all get them sometimes.
get what?
nightmares.
it's not that bad.
you want to talk about it, you know where I am.
uh, they're ready.
okay.
contrary to popular belief there has never been a proven case of satanic ritual killing.
never a verified human sacrifice.
having said that, there have been isolated cases of animal sacrifice...
many, many cases of vandalism in the name of satan.
but that doesn't mean that ritual satanism is impossible.
more importantly, for our purposes there have been cults that killed, just not in ritual fashion.
the Reverend Jim Jones and the peoples temple...
his followers killed a U. S. Congressman and 3 people before committing mass suicide and leaving over 900 people dead.
and perhaps the most widely-known of the killer cults the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson killed 9 people in a 4-day period in an attempt to initiate a race war.
killer cults do exist, and they all have one thing in common...
invariably they're headed by charismatic megalomaniacs.
you're looking for that leader. He's who will stand out.
he'll be memorable to somebody, people who aren't in his group will see him as strange, weird, scary.
since we're dealing with professed satanists which is often practiced by younger males we may be looking for teenagers.
heavy metal music is often associated with satanism and these kids and their leader may reflect that in their look.
most likely, there'll be sex, drugs and alcohol.
and the leader, he'll be older.
it's part of his charm.
and he is from this area.
he's definitely local.
these woods are too thick and confusing for a visitor to get around in.
you think one of our own people is doing this?
we're sure of it.
I would know if someone was capable of doing
dad. I know somebody like that.
his name's Mike Zizzo.
he graduated about 5 years ago.
he's in his 20s, but he still hangs out with high school kids.
he's got a group of them.
they follow him everywhere.
they all get high and listen to heavy metal.
he calls them the lords of destruction.
how do you know this, Cory?
it's all right, son.
I've been there, where they hang out drinking beers.
he talks about Satan all the time.
says he's the one true god.
where is this place?
on the other side of the mountain. The old Jenson house.
it's out of my jurisdiction.
not ours.
sorry, dad.
I'm not going on the raid.
what's up?
