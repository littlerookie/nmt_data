all right, look, if you're going to twist my arm, the I. O.A. have made their final decision.
they've chosen the new leader of Atlantis.
well, who is it?
well, there's been no formal announcement, but word is, they're going with their foremost expert in ancient technology and Replicator activity.
who does that sound like to you?
you? - Yes. Who else?
well, I heard they were leaning toward someone with a science background
and why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.
Oh, oh, and by "us," you mean "you.
exactly.
it's kind of scary, though.
you know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city, but the entire galaxy.
Yes, scary.
very scary - On the other hand, a leader never second-guesses himself.
I'm up for the challenge.
I know I am.
I'm going to make them proud.
Radek, I'm going to make you proud.
the Wraith-Replicator war is in full swing.
from what I hear, the Replicators are kicking some serious ass in their last offensive.
that's good news, John. Well done.
Hey! - I'll have the reports ready for you.
uh... what's new?
just making preparations for the change in command here.
you don't have to tell me. I already know.
Really?
I just want to say that I think the I. O.A. could not have made a better choice.
Thanks, Rodney.
no, no, no, no, you are too kind.
what?
uh... "thank you, Rodney?
no, no, wait a minute. You mean the...
reunion
I thought you guys were dead.
believe me, so did we.
how did you manage to survive the Wraith attack on Sateda?
we weren't there.
I don't understand.
when we first made the decision to fight back against the Wraith, we didn't just wait for them to come to us.
we started running ops against some of their known strongholds.
they were quick strikes.
get in, hit 'em hard, get out.
only on this particular occasion, we kind of messed up the getting out part.
I saw the darts hit your position.
what you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside.
when the Wraith attacked the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in.
it took us three days to dig our way out.
and by then, the place was crawling with them.
it was obvious they were gearing up for an attack.
took another two weeks before we could find our way through the gate, and by then...
it was too late.
when we got back to Sateda, there was nothing left.
I'm sorry.
I should have never left you behind.
when you took second squad back to the gate, you had no way of knowing those darts were going to come through
and if we'd have gone back with you then we would have died in the attack on Sateda along with everybody else.
the only reason why you survived was because they made you a runner.
you heard about that?
a while back, we started hearing stories.
they said you were seven feet tall and had the strength of five men.
people like to exaggerate.
they also said you killed a hundred Wraith.
that part sounds about right.
well, then...
to the misery of our enemies and the reunion of friends come back from the dead.
Oh, yeah.
on the day I left Chulak master Bratac said to me "draw from your past but do not let your past draw from you.
that's good advice.
still, I know I'm going to miss this place, and all of you.
I would have been offended had you felt otherwise.
10 years is a long time.
it has been 10 years well spent.
we have defeated numerous enemies and overcome many threats.
it was never dull.
we have accomplished much here, but now it is Atlantis that is in need of you.
yeah...
part of me is looking forward to going, but...
you know, there's a part of me that thinks maybe it's too soon, that I'm leaving my work here unfinished.
your work will continue only in a different place.
you have been bestowed an incredible honor, Colonel Carter, and I believe you should embrace it.
and know this...
though we may not be leaving with you,
sg-1 will never be far away.
so I can expect you guys to come and visit sometime?
undomesticated equines could not keep me away.
nice call-back.
indeed
all right.
time to go.
what's that?
it's a selection of fruits from the various worlds we trade with.
I thought it'd be thoughtful.
try lame.
really, and what would you suggest?
you know, maybe some flowers.
you could brighten up her quarters.
Oh, flowers.
here, take this, and go.
Colonel Carter welcome to Atlantis.
thank you.
it's nice to be here.
I want you all to know how honored I am to accept this appointment.
I've come here fully committed to this expedition, to Atlantis, and most importantly, to each and every one of you.
I look forward to working with all of you.
thank you.
nice speech.
thank you.
I also do weddings and award shows.
book early to avoid disappointment.
should we go check out your new digs?
yeah
stings, doesn't it?
what the hell have the three of you been doing all these years?
Oh eating, drinking killing Wraith
we've hit 'em more times than I can count.
racked up a pretty nice body count.
not to mention the 12 darts we've downed.
we're armed, mobile, and, occasionally, get good intel.
well, sounds like a pretty nice run.
but there have been a few sacrifices.
yeah? What do you mean?
there were five of us who came out of that cave alive...
but we lost marika on the first assault against the Wraith and then hemi last year.
it hasn't been easy.
we don't have much to work with, but we make do.
sometimes, it's not enough.
Yeah, well, I might be able to help.
we've got the manpower, the equipment.
my friends and I, we can...
anyway, um...
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
thank you
Hey, Rodney. Come on in.
I brought you a little something to spruce up the place.
well, thank you. That's very sweet.
there's a vase right there.
Oh, Colonel sheppard dropped that off.
apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the home worlds of our various trading partners.
I thought it was a really thoughtful gesture.
son of A...
anyway look, I just... I just came by to welcome you to Atlantis, see how you're settling in, and you know, if you needed anything, and did I mention I was seeing someone?
I'm sorry, what?
I'm, uh, seeing someone.
Yes, I only bring it up now because you're here now and we'll be working together a lot more, and our past?
well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.
I just don't want things to be awkward between the two of us, you know?
kind of like they are now.
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just...
with you... - I hear you're in charge.
Ronon, this is Colonel Carter. Sam, this is Ronon. He's
satedan and a member of your team. Of course.
what can I do for you?
I want to bring some friends to Atlantis, and, apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.
unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any off-world visits to Atlantis for the time being.
on whose authority?
it was a directive from the I. O.A.
well, they don't need to know.
Ronon, she's
I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.
it is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.
and it will.
they're my people. I'll vouch for them.
I'm sure you can, but for now, we're on a new planet with a new set of rules.
and a new person in charge.
Weir never would've doubted me.
okay, first of all, Ronon,
I'm not doubting you.
these new regulations apply to everyone on this base, and secondly...
I'm not dr. Weir.
is he always like that?
no, no...
no, actually, you caught him on a good day.
try it together, and turn!
work on it.
well, that was fast.
Yeah, I said it would be.
you could have taken your time.
we like it here.
we're thinking of staying on a few more days.
then where will you go?
wherever
that's one of the nice things about not being tied down.
you go where you want, and you leave when you're not wanted.
Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would show a little bit more hospitality, but...
don't worry about it.
I understand.
not everybody gets an invitation to Atlantis.
don't look so surprised.
you travel as much around this galaxy as we do and sooner or later, you'll start hearing rumors about new people in the city of the ancients and the runner who joined 'em.
man, I'm sorry.
I wish I could've been straight with you from the start.
they placed their trust in you, and you proved them worthy.
I wouldn't have expected any less.
Yeah, but still-- - what you thought they'd make an exception because it was you asking?
I'm supposed to be their friend-- - no.
you're their ally.
their guest.
me, rakai, and ara, we're your friends.
I don't doubt they're good people.
they helped you out when you needed it and from what I hear, they've done more to hurt the Wraith than anyone.
you've got to respect that but it doesn't mean you've got to commit to them.
the way I see it, now that we're back together...
you belong with us.
pretty impressive, isn't it?
to be honest, it's a little overwhelming.
coming from somebody with your record, that says something.
you know, john, your name was on the short list.
Yeah, I know.
I saw what they did to Elizabeth, the politics and the red tape. I didn't envy her.
I don't envy you.
Thanks.
you know, for most of us, this thing with Elizabeth isn't over yet.
she's still out there.
you really believe there's a chance she's still alive?
there's only one way to know for sure.
we should have done it sooner but the I. O.A.'S been stonewalling me.
now that you're in charge, maybe you can give me the green light.
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.
it's no more dangerous than the last time we went in.
circumstances were different. Plus, you had an advantage then that you don't have now.
well, she's the one who gave us that advantage.
the only reason we're here is because of what she did.
believe me, I know and I don't like the idea of leaving someone behind any more than you do but I'm not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission.
now, you come to me with a plan that has an even an outside chance of succeeding and I'll consider it.
short of that, john, I'm sorry.
there's nothing I can do.
fair enough.
you seem distracted today.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
what's wrong? - There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.
very well. I suppose we should just continue training.
there's nothing!
okay, stop hitting me!
God... I'll talk.
I'm thinking of leaving Atlantis.
where would you go?
must it come down to a choice between Atlantis and your Satedan friends?
they're more than my friends, Teyla. They're my family.
we've always been there for each other.
you wouldn't understand.
I disagree.
leaving my fellow athosians for a home here on Atlantis was a very difficult decision.
I was their leader.
for some the only leader they'd ever known and despite the fact that I was as close as a trip through the stargate there were moments when I felt I'd betrayed them.
so what? You got over it? - No.
I sometimes still second-guess my decision then I remember that I can do more here to help my people and the rest of humans in this galaxy than I ever could on my home world.
Teyla's already spoken to you, hasn't she?
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.
so let's hear it.
hear what?
whatever you've got to say.
not going to say anything. - Really?
I don't have to, because you already know what I'm going to tell you.
that you're a valuable member of my team and that it would be difficult to find somebody to take your place.
and that you may think you're going back to find something you've lost, but there's nothing to go back to.
you're not going to say any of that?
I don't have to.
look, this isn't about me trying to bring back the past.
well, then what is it?
they need me.
they always have.
I'm the one that took care of them, got them home alive whenever we went into battle.
you're one man, Ronon.
you can't expect to protect them forever.
probably not...
but that's where you guys come in.
we got some intel on a Wraith target.
the Wraith and the Replicators are kind of beating the crap out of each other right now.
I think it's counter-productive to run an op against them.
I have a feeling you'll change your mind once you hear the details.
let's hear it.
not yet.
you want to hit a Wraith lab?
no offense, but that's awfully close to
it's a weapons research facility.
from what we've heard, the place is undermanned
we know the Wraith are being attacked on several fronts.
they don't have the resources anymore to properly guard all their facilities.
still, she did say, "undermanned" rather than "unmanned.
there is a big difference.
it won't matter. We can handle it.
then why do you need our help to pull it off?
we don'T.
but we will need your help to get away once we're done.
I see.
we're your designated drivers.
this is our target.
it's located a good half day's journey from the gate on foot.
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
don't worry. All you got to do is fly.
we'll do the legwork.
well, that's very considerate of you, but if we commit, we're all in.
and I really don't see why we would.
I mean, sure it would be great to get our hands on some new Wraith tech, but maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile, or maybe bought some off of ebay, but
I think what he's trying to say is, we're not really sure if we want to risk our lives for something like this.
maybe wait a month or two let the Replicators and the Wraith soften each other up then we do lunch, we talk about it again.
one of the things they're working on right now in the lab is a way to switch off the Replicator attack code.
is such a thing even possible?
the Wraith may have done it the first time.
well, we can't let it happen.
no.
if the war with the Replicators ends, then the Wraith will once again be able to direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy.
so...
are you in?
your buddies seem like a perfectly capable enough bunch but if I do this, the last thing I need is someone going off half-cocked and risking this op and, well, oh, yeah, our asses.
this isn't their first time doing this, john.
may be the first time doing it with company though, and I don't want it turning into a big pissing match
Yeah, well, I'll keep my group in line. Do the same for yours.
last time I checked, it was your group, too.
yeah...
look, I was going to wait to tell you this, but I've made my decision.
once we finish this op
I'm going to be leaving Atlantis.
come on in.
packing?
yeah
you know, the fact that you brought all this stuff here tells me that you considered Atlantis home that you were happy here
Yeah, well, I was.
I am.
your friends are worried about you.
well, they shouldn't be. I can take care of myself.
that's not the point.
when you accepted the offer to join Atlantis, you became a part of something and, like it or not, you have roots here now people who care about you, who depend on you
walking away may be a lot harder than you think.
Oh, I'm not walking away.
just because I'm not a part of sheppard's team does not mean
I'm any less willing to help out Atlantis, or put my life on the line for any of you.
I'm not questioning your loyalty, Ronon, only the wisdom in leaving, if, as you say, you don't want to turn your back on Atlantis.
coordinating our efforts with you and your friends may not be so easy.
we're about to find out, aren't we?
I need you to reconsider your decision to leave.
and if I don't, given everything that I know about Atlantis, you will try and stop me.
I'm hoping it won't come to that.
put us down near the south end.
we'll meet less resistance if we access this place through the back.
got it.
once we head in, we'll take the lead.
you watch our backs.
do you know where you're going?
our target is located somewhere on the second level.
uh, maybe you could be a little more specific?
we don't have an exact floor plan, if that's what you're asking.
the whole second level is a high-security sector.
if you are unsure, would it not be counter-productive for us to follow you?
it's better this way.
these Wraith facilities are very confusing.
we know what we're looking for.
Oh, and we don't?
this isn't exactly our first op, you know.
really.
how many Wraith have you killed in hand-to-hand combat?
I hardly think that's what this is about.
that's what I thought. - You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay?
compared to us, you are amateurs.
easy.
if we can't play nice together, then let's not.
we got a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time, so we will follow your lead.
then we'll split up into two teams once we reach the second level.
are you cool with that?
yes
good
approaching target location.
this is it.
hurry up!
I got it.
everybody in.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
yeah
good luck.
let's go.
what do you think?
test subjects? Or the Wraith version of a vending machine.
I hate to be the guy to say it, but we can't really help these people.
we got to keep moving.
right
this thing's been way too quiet and way too easy.
I kind of like quiet and easy. Makes for a nice change.
wraith!
Ronon, wait!
Rodney, get that door open!
the hell with it.
Aw, come on, it worked for him!
Hah! I did it!
Oh, thank god, it's you three.
they got Teyla and sheppard, and
bring him.
who's the amateur now?
Ronon, what happened?
I need to talk to Colonel Carter right away
John, are you all right?
bit of a hangover.
the fact that Ronon and his buddies aren't here is a good sign.
not really.
ronon's buddies are the reason we're here. They set us up.
what are you talking about?
I ran into them while I was trying to esc
while I was effecting a strategic retreat.
they stunned me.
are you sure?
it's pretty hard to misinterpret something like that.
was Ronon with them?
I didn't see him.
that one.
hold on, here, guys.
stay strong, Rodney!
I'll try.
I said, I'm fine.
I tried to radio sheppard, but got no response from him, Teyla, or mckay.
and what about the Satedans?
we got separated.
I'm guessing the Wraith got to them, too.
so much for this op being a cake-walk.
okay we've gone from support to rescue and recovery.
Dr. Zelenka, ready a jumper
Yes, Colonel.
they'll be expecting us.
make that two jumpers.
would you guys mind telling me where we're going?
seriously, I'm not big on surprises.
even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my christmas presents because I couldn't stand the suspense.
I remember this one time-- - we require your assistance.
with what?
you tampered with the Replicator base code.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?
this is not the first time they have challenged us.
so it was the Wraith that deactivated the attack code.
many thousands of years ago.
we had defeated the ancients. The galaxy was ours, and then these...
things appeared.
I take it you're not a big fan-- - they are an abomination!
they're not even alive.
in other words, you can't eat them, so they're no good to you.
they are machines.
machines can be reprogrammed.
okay, fine, so, what do you want from me?
we have attempted to upload the deactivation virus once again.
our attempts have been unsuccessful.
we need you to undo the changes you made so as to render the virus once more effective against them.
of course. I see.
things is, that could be kind of tricky.
the test subject will make things easier for you.
test subject?
a Replicator.
Oh, my god.
I've thought about it, and I want you to know that when the time comes,
I'll respect whatever decision you make regarding your future with us.
this could be the one and only op we go on together.
then we'd better make the most of it.
Dr. Mckay...
how is your work progressing?
it's been kind of slow.
I mean, re-establishing the base code's original setting isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.
Colonel sheppard and Teyla will be most disappointed to hear this.
I'll see to it.
I think I might be able to get it finished much sooner.
I understand your desire to delay in the hope that it will give your people time to mount a rescue.
in fact, I've just received word they're on their way, but we are ready for them.
okay, they're moving away.
thank you, jumper two.
take us in, lieutenant.
Yes, Colonel.
let's go, let's go!
there's a power relay behind this wall here.
you all right? - Well, it's about time.
any longer, we would've had to save ourselves.
did Ronon manage to make it back to Atlantis?
he did. - Where is he?
we split up to cover more ground.
secure the entrance. Let's go.
all right, come on, let's get out of here.
where are you holding them?
why don't you ask your friends?
all clear.
all clear? You could've shot me!
Oh, no.
Oh, no...
let's go find Ronon.
deal with him.
you're Wraith-worshipers?
Ronon, you need to understand that-- - after what they did to Sateda!
sateda is gone and so are the lives we knew.
we had a choice to die with the past, or live for the future.
what did they do to you?
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
the same gift can be yours, if you're willing to accept it.
we resisted at first, we were stubborn, but the Wraith were determined.
they showed us our futures.
they allowed us to experience our life's end, pushing us to the brink so that we could see the truth, and brought us back
they showed us again, and again, and again...
until they broke you.
until we finally accepted the truth and their gift join us.
you're insane
don't let your pride get in the way.
like marika and hemi.
they didn't die on any run, did they?
they were murdered because they wouldn't turn.
they were killed by their own stubbornness.
don't make the same mistake.
join us! - No.
never.
run. You run.
run, and get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
there won't be a next time.
we'll finish this like true Satedans.
you are not Satedans!
rakai, no!
so much for honor.
no weapons.
hasn't there been enough killing?
huh? 
Ronon, where are your friends?
they're right here.
let's go home.
is that my painting?
Yes.
Rodney felt that you should have it back.
I didn't give it to him.
well, he helped himself, assuming that you were leaving it behind.
how you feeling?
all right
it's nice to have you back.
thanks
look, I need some help in here!
all right, look.
I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that.
you need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering who tied you to the desk.
well, the truth is, it was you.
I mean, me.
I did it because I needed you to get this message.
it would take too long to give you the full explanation, and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're just going to have to trust me on this.
now, you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair.
find it, and cut yourself loose.
now...
I need you to listen.
it is vitally important that you find this woman.
I don't know where she is, but you have to find her.
she can help.
check the mess hall, or maybe they took her to the brig, I don't know.
you just have to keep looking.
don't worry about anything else, and for god's sake, don't trust anyone.
just find her and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people are going to die.
including you.
14 hours earlier
Hey, what are you doing here?
well, I heard you were back, and I hadn't seen you for a while, so
Yeah, I know. We have this whole new mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back samples all week.
so I see. Anything interesting?
well, it's all pretty similar to what we found back on lantia.
we found a few new species.
Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you.
I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.
what is that?
well, it doesn't have a name yet, but I'm thinking of calling it...
after you.
Really?
What...you can do that?
Yeah.
be careful.
the bristles will pierce skin.
anyway, look, I wondered if I could...
you know, tear you away from all this long enough to have some lunch?
Oh, I would-I would love to, but...
I think I'm coming down with something.
I have a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary.
Oh, uh...
well, I'll come with you.
Oh, no, rodney, you don't have to do that.
I know how much you hate being around sick people.
no, really, it's fine.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Thanks.
after you.
Dr. Brown...
I see you've brought my number one patient.
what? Oh, no, we're not here for me this time. I'm-I'm here for her.
Oh, okay, well, what can I do for you?
well, I've got this really bad headache that won't go away, and I feel kind of dizzy.
when did you first notice it?
some time this morning. Why?
well, because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms, and the second person from the botany department.
hey...
who's that?
gerald Baxter. He's on my team.
you've met him before.
he's got the bug collection?
Oh, sure, right, yeah.
I remember now.
well, I'm going to need to take some blood.
you, too, doctor.
what?
if there is something going around, you might have been exposed to it as well.
sorry.
major Dorsey and his team just returned from m6r-214.
they examined the debris field above the planet and found the parts from one, possibly two, replicator ships.
it was just a matter of time before the wraith got organized and started hitting back.
I suppose.
they did defeat the ancients, after all.
the replicators may look like the ancients, and they may use the same technology, but they're going to be a lot tougher to put down.
Colonel Carter, come in, please.
go ahead, doctor.
I've got a situation developing.
be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.
what's going on?
11 patients have shown up here in the last hour, complaining of headache and dizziness.
eight of them are from the survey teams that just got back from the mainland.
any idea what's wrong with them?
I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've never seen before.
I'm checking it against the ancient database.
what do you want us to do?
well, the first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland, and have them report to Dr. Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing.
will do. Keep us posted.
more test results.
you and I are both infected.
so's Dr. Mckay.
the good news is the most advanced case is still only showing mild, flu-like symptoms.
maybe it won't get any worse than that.
Yeah, let's hope so.
present
Hello?
hey...hey, wake up.
what are you doing here?
I-I don't know.
what are you doing?
you're not a soldier.
if you say so.
you should come with me.
it's safer.
no, slow down.
what's going on here?
it's the soldiers. They're after us.
if they catch us, they'll take us away.
take us where? What soldiers? What is this place?
will you shut up? The soldiers will hear us!
what the hell is going on here?
why can't I remember anything
I don't know. No one can.
no one can?
you've seen others?
Yes, one or two others, apart from the soldiers.
what about her? Was she there?
no.
I have to find her.
Why?
I don't know. It's important.
look, the soldiers probably have her by now, okay?
well, can we ask them?
are you crazy?
if the soldiers see you, they shoot you, take you away.
again with the taking away.
you should come hide with me. It's safe.
I can't, I have to keep looking.
fine, suit yourself.
if you get yourself killed, I don't care.
it started suddenly,and then it just...just stopped.
okay, well, I appreciate you telling me.
aren't you going to do anything?
to be honest, I don't see how it's relevant.
well, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be important.
I don't see how a "tingling sensation in your knees" relates to this condition, especially since you're the only one experiencing it.
Yeah, but so far.
I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease.
look, the best thing for you to do right now is try to relax, okay, and let me do my work.
here you go.
thank you.
what did dr. Keller say?
Oh,she's going to take it into consideration.
thanked me for my input and...
how you doing?
I'm okay.
well, dr. Keller's got her team working pretty hard.
I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff.
I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.
seriously, are you okay?
It'S...my headache.
it's-it's getting worse.
look, is there anything I can do?
could you, uh...
ask the nurse to bring me some tea?
Well...What's wrong with this one?
Oh...
right.
Marie? What's...what's going on?
I don't know.
I just got really dizzy.
are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol?
I'm not entirely sure.
it's possible she could have been previously exposed, but that would mean it's already spread much farther among than general population than we thought.
I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the city just to get a sense of where we're at.
have we confirmed it came from the mainland?
well, the plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative, but it still seems like the most likely point of origin.
what about the database?
I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still looking.
there is one more thing.
since we have no idea what this disease does, or how it's spread, or even if our containment measures are having any effect,
I recommend we suspend all gate travel immediately.
thank you, doctor.
hey...
how you feeling?
I-I don't know.
Oh. Well, they brought dinner.
this salisbury steak's actually quite good.
Oh, and by the way, I asked dr. Keller about your friend, dr. Baxter.
she says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down.
who?
Dr. Baxter. That's his name, right, the guy on your team?
where am I?
what do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I brought you here, remember?
who are you?
present
Hey!
hold it right there.
I don't want to cause any trouble. I just
Yeah, put him with the others.
get him out of here.
Yes, sir.
8 hours earlier well, what's the word?
well, the random test results came back.
six different people working in six different areas of the city, all positive.
that doesn't sound very promising.
well, it's either a statistical miracle, or the entire base has been exposed.
we're running more tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.
I don't know about you, but I feel fine.
well, me too, and that's the problem.
if there is a delay before the first symptoms appear, it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening.
I've informed stargate command that we're suspending gate operations.
Colonel Carter, this is dr. Keller.
go ahead.
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown, as well three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia.
all of them show large concentrations of affected cells in the medial temporal lobe.
it looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory.
how bad are we talking?
well, rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient, but, in all cases, it looks like it's progressive, meaning, the longer they go without treatment, the worse it gets.
pretty soon, they won't be able to remember their own names.
you said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness.
Yeah, that's right.
how long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss?
again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an average of about six hours.
what about you, doc, showing any signs?
Yeah, the headaches started half an hour ago.
all right, keep searching the database.
it still think it's our best bet to find a solution.
I'd love to, but if we're right about these numbers,
I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients.
it's already pretty crowded in here.
mess hall.
we can clear it out and make a temporary ward.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
at the very least, it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.
do it.
are you all right?
Yeah.
where am I?
we were hoping you could tell us.
who are all you people?
we don't know.
none of us can remember anything.
what's happening out there? What did you see?
nothing.
it was just empty hallways.
how did I get here?
the soldiers brought you.
Why?
they bring everyone here.
they say it's for our own protection.
don't waste your time.
it won't open.
why are they doing this to us?
look, why can't anyone remember?
my...
the computer.
Where's my computer?
it wasn't with you when they brought you here.
Why?
I have to find someone.
it's a woman.
do you know who that is?
does anyone here know Teyla?
anyone?
I thought this city had some sort of automatic lockdown to prevent stuff like this.
it does.
Oh, yeah?
what happened?
you're asking me?
you got a headache?
Yeah, I guess it was just a matter of time.
John? -I'm fine.
Hey.
how you feeling?
I am fine.
any symptoms?
no, none yet.
me neither.
what is it?
how do they know we're all infected?
my blood wasn't part of the sample that was tested.
nor was mine.
even so, it is likely we were exposed.
so? Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it.
maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way, and all I know is I feel great.
so do I.
perhaps you should make dr. Keller aware of this.
Yeah.
okay.
excuse me.
Dr.Keller...I need to talk to you.
I'm a little busy right now.
I'm not sick.
well, if you're lucky enough not to be exposed, you just blew it by coming in here.
no, I know I've been exposed.
people I've been working with all day have been getting sick, but I'm not feeling anything.
neither is Teyla.
you think you might have some kind of immunity?
you're the doctor.
okay.
well, I'm going to need a sample of your blood.
take as much as you need.
what are you doing?
I have to remember somehow.
I already feel certain things slipping away.
all right, now what are you doing?
getting out of here.
all right, everyone!
listen up!
I need to escape quickly!
does anyone know how I can do that?
you can't just leave.
why not?
what about the soldiers?
we're just going to have to deal with them.
I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them.
that doesn't mean we should be running loose.
we have no idea what's out there.
look, something caused this to happen, all right?
and we're not going to figure it out from in here.
somewhere out there, there is a woman that...
a woman named...
Teyla. - Teyla, right, thank you.
I think she knows something.
what?
I don't know.
we got to get out there and find out.
I think we should listen to him.
Why?
it makes sense.
why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?
why haven't there been any announcements, or any help on the way?
maybe they don't know any more than we do.
we need a plan.
they let you out?
well, the second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive.
didn't see much point in quarantining the infirmary anymore.
you showing any signs?
headache?
Yeah, same here.
five bucks says you start losing your memories first.
all right, we've got food, water, and blankets.
we don't have enough beds, but we're just going to have to make do.
we may need to think about ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall.
I mean, they're going to wind up there anyways, and, this way, we won't have people with no memories wandering the hallways.
that's what I'm worried about.
I'll send lorne and a team out, make sure those orders are followed.
these are from dr. Neves.
they're stimulants.
he thinks they may slow the effects of the memory loss.
it's just a stopgap, but at least it may buy us a few hours.
do we know what's in these?
because I'm allergic to a lot of-- -take it.
hand these out to Lorne and his men.
one more thing.
I've ordered dr. Zelanka to remove the gate's main control crystal.
no matter what happens, we cannot risk spreading this disease elsewhere in the galaxy, or to earth.
and what happens when we all start losing our memory?
Dr. Keller will come up with something before that happens.
hey...
I thought we were moving everyone to the mess hall.
he's our most advanced case.
his vitals are too unstable.
what can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you found anything.
what do you mean?
I'm not showing any sign of the disease, remember?
Oh, well, it's possible you could have some sort of natural immunity.
Doc...doc... -I'm going to take a sample of your blood
you've already done that.
it's happening to me, isn't it?
doctor, he's convulsing!
okay, uh...
give him, uh...
m-medazilam, four milligrams.
he's in v-fib. I need a crash cart.
charge it to 200.
clear.
charge it to 300.
clear.
go, go!
stop!
stop!
this way!
okay, I think we're clear.
Oh, thank god.
my lungs were about to give out.
so, what next?
I don't know.
how do we find her?
who?
Teyla. The one we just risked our lives for.
right, right.
I don't know.
all right, we'll just have to search room by room.
I mean, how big could this place possibly be?
where are you taking us?
I already told you. The mess hall.
I don't want to go there.
just relax.
I know you're scared, but you're just going to have to trust me.
it's for your own good.
so much for coming quietly.
hey...
mess hall's this way.
right.
don't look at me that way.
it's easy to get turned around in this place.
major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers.
we're starting to get a little resistance.
Yeah, they're starting to lose their memories.
they probably can't understand why soldiers are after them.
that's why I told him to take his men to the armory and equip them with stunners.
I'm not sure I like the idea of us shooting at our own people.
well, we may not have a choice.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
pretty soon, there's going to be some panicked, confused people out there.
okay, carry on.
what?
come with me.
you might want to go easy on that stuff, major.
sir, we need to delay this thing as much as possible.
if we all go, there's no coming back.
Yeah, I know.
that's what I want to talk to you about.
I got an idea.
didn't we come this way before?
no.
are you sure?
no.
I have an idea.
what are you doing?
if we come back here, we'll know we've been this way before.
presuming of course that we remember that we're the ones who put it there in the first place.
I know you're out there.
drop your weapons and come out slowly.
little guy with glasses.
what are you doing?
Hey, I know him.
don't shoot.
I don't have any weapons.
who are you?
we were captured by the soldiers.
we escaped.
Really?
wait a second.
what is that?
I found it.
let me see.
what is it?
I don't know, but something tells me it's important.
Why?
I don't know.
Hey, how did you know to do that?
I don't know. I just did.
well, that's her, teyla.
you know her?
well, not exactly.
we're looking for her. We think she can help us.
it says,"find her."
how are we going to do that?
this is what I wanted to show you.
this is the bacteria that is causing our disease?
not exactly, but it's very similar.
and you found this in the database?
I stopped looking in the database.
I knew there was a reason why teyla and ronon are the only people who've tested negative so far, and we don't have a lot of information on the satedans, so I started looking through dr. Beckett's records on the athosians.
this is a blood sample taken from a 10-year-old boy.
he was suffering from something called, um...
I wrote it down.
kirsan fever?
Yeah, that's it.
it is a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy.
I had it when I was eight.
I had it when I was 10.
but this cannot be the same disease.
kirsan fever does not affect adults, nor does it cause memory loss.
well, that may be true, but the structure of the bacteria is too similar to ignore.
they have to be related somehow.
wait a minute.
maybe they are the same.
that would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.
how is that possible?
well, think about it.
I mean, this planet didn't have a stargate until we came here.
maybe when the ancients were first scouting this place, they accidentally brought this, uh...
kirsan fever with them.
it got trapped here, and over the course of 10, 000 years, it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing.
that would also explain why you and ronon aren't affected.
you have antibodies built up from when you were young.
well, if they have the antibodies, then-- it would take months to reverse-engineer a cure.
I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.
the sap of the enchuri plant.
my people have used it for generations to combat kirsan fever.
it is highly effective and not much is needed.
let's go get some.
take a jumper.
wait a minute.
you disabled the gate, remember?
you ordered dr. Zelenka to take the control crystal.
where did he put it?
Zelenka, this is sheppard, come in.
check out the rooms down there and there.
I want this section cleared out in 10 minutes.
Lorne, come in.
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
have you seen zelenka?
as a matter of fact, I have.
did you bring him to the mess hall?
uh, sorry, sir, but he gave us the slip.
must have heard us coming.
cracked one of my people over the head with a metal rod and disappeared down a service hatch before I could get a shot off.
there's no telling where he is now.
Zelenka, respond.
Zelenka, come in.
Radek, we are not trying to hurt you.
we need your help.
okay, this is pointless.
look, we don't even know if he still has a radio, and even if we find him, chances are, he's not going to remember what he did with the control crystal.
let's face it, we're screwed.
there's gotta be some way out of this.
what about the jumpers? They got DHDs.
without the control crystal, the gate can't establish a stable wormhole.
we're not going anywhere.
I'm missing something.
I can't concentrate.
what about the mainland?
ronon is right.
the enchuri plant is abundant on many worlds.
it may be here as well.
all right.
assuming we can find the stuff, how are we going to distribute it?
I'll figure something out.
I'll stay with rodney.
do you know what to look for?
grows like a weed on sateda.
it's, uh...right there.
you can fly this thing.
it's in your blood.
literally.
wait a second...
what am I doing?
you said the quickest way to spread the cure was to aerosolize it and distribute it through the ventilation system.
you are currently attempting to override base protocol for temperature, humidity, and air pressure.
Right...right, okay, it's easy.
just a simple matter of accessing the root directory, and
Aw, come on!
no, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my sleep.
Oh, god...
it's happening to me too, isn't it?
you have to remain calm.
my memory was lousy to start with.
I mean, people's names, birthdays.
I once forgot mother's day five years in a row.
what is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter?
well, that's pi. It's 3. 14159265, et cetera, et cetera.
that doesn't count. That's easy.
you are a scientist, Rodney.
that is what you care about.
that is what you will hang on to the longest.
right.
right, so...
wait a minute.
doesn't that make me a really bad person?
it makes you the type of person who is going to save all our lives.
Oh, okay.
what is this place?
I don't know.
looks like they left in a hurry.
she's not here. Let'...
down here! This way!
quiet! Go, go.
all right, everybody, spread out.
they got to be in here somewhere.
sir!
found 'em.
good.
let's go. Let's move out, come on.
can we get out of here, please?
what is it?
I have an idea.
come on.
let's go.
wait a minute.
what is this place?
the mainland.
what are we doing here?
I told you already.
we need to get that plant.
something seems fishy.
never gets old.
sorry, buddy. You're just going to slow me down.
how's it coming, rodney?
I'm just about finished.
I think.
what was that?
I will go see.
keep working.
don't move!
major Lorne.
it's me, teyla.
you shouldn't be out here.
major, it's me.
everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall.
but dr. Mckay and I
put your hands on your head.
slowly.
Oh, god...
all right, let's get her up.
come on...
all right.
look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that.
you need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering who tied you to the desk...
you're awake.
major lorne, you must set me free
you're not going anywhere till I get some answers.
I need to know what you've done to my people.
what I've done?
you believe I'm behind this?
is it a drug?
some kind of bio-weapon?
major, they're sick.
you as well.
the entire base is infected with a disease.
everyone except you.
Yes.
I'm immune to its effects.
isn't that convenient?
how many of those have you taken?
why don't you just let me worry about that, okay?
it's the pills.
they're what's making you act like this.
they're confusing you.
they're making you unstable.
making me unstable?
I'm not the one who unleashed a disease on my people, okay?
quit stalling.
I want to know what you were doing in the hall
Yes.
it's good to see you.
Colonel carter, dr. Zelenka, you as well.
how did you find me?
uh, well, we were having trouble finding you by ourselves, so we followed him.
did you finish your work?
W-what do you mean?
can you disarm the force shield?
I-I don't know.
quickly.
don't move.
drop it.
now back away.
now...
tell me...
who the hell are you?
I know you don't remember everything.
you have no idea what's going on.
you're confused, maybe even a little scared.
I know I would be.
but you have to trust me.
we're friends.
the things we've been through together...
I don't care what anyone says, no disease can wipe that away.
not completely.
okay, deep down, you know I'm telling the truth.
now, give me the gun.
Oh, nice try.
for all I know, you're the one who tied me up.
fine.
then shoot me, and you'll be all alone in the middle of a dark forest with no idea who you are, where you're going, or what you're going to do next.
how could I possibly make it any worse?
that's a good point.
here.
sit.
are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?
I do not know how.
Oh, and I do?
Yes.
you created the override program.
you said you were almost finished.
Oh, then it should be easy.
Rodney, listen to me.
you must do this.
it is our only chance.
the knowledge is inside you.
you just have to find it.
program Complete
he did it.
when I said I was almost finished, I-I guess I wasn't kidding.
now what?
well, now we just have to hope that colonel sheppard and ronon completed their side of the mission.
right.
who?
what is it?
a ship. Headed for the bay doors on the roof.
have they identified themselves?
no, sir.
it could be help.
it could also be some kind of an attack.
get in touch with the others. Tell them to meet me at the jumper bay.
and find major lorne!
nice flying.
Thanks.
come on, help me with this stuff.
we got to get this to Teyla right away.
who?
come on.
hands in the air. Now.
listen, lieutenant, this is medicine.
we need to deliver it.
I said, hands in the air.
let's take them to the brig.
you're making a mistake.
there are sick people who need that.
you sure you know what you're doing?
what the hell is going on here?
sir, we caught these men trying to infiltrate the base.
Lorne, you have got to listen to me.
everybody on this base is going to die if you don'T.
and who are you?
look in your pocket.
what?
just look in your vest pocket.
you took a picture of him just in case it came to this.
I was there.
he's telling the truth.
this is our commanding officer.
that's right.
I am your commanding officer.
so...
you should do what I say.
Yes, sir.
what are your orders?
do what he says.
gun.
follow me.
Colonel, you're awake.
what happened?
Teyla distributed the plant through the ventilation system.
knocked you out for a bit.
how long have I been asleep?
about a day.
a day?
hit some people harder than others.
how are you feeling, john?
how's your memory?
Oh, pretty good, I think.
I mean...
things are a little fuzzy.
if I forget your birthday next year...
I will forgive you.
when you are feeling well enough, major lorne wishes to speak with you.
he feels badly about what happened.
it wasn't his fault.
just glad he still had the photo I gave him.
that was good thinking, by the way.
Yes. If the distribution of the cure had been delayed any longer, many more people would have died.
what do you mean?
Where's mckay?
you should get some sleep.
it's okay. I'm...fine.
I can let you know when she wakes up.
I'm going to stay.
okay.
she's not giving up, you know.
she's a fighter.
doctor!
she's moving her fingers.
hey...
where am I?
you're in the infirmary.
you're safe.
do you remember anything?
it's good to see you.
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
I could easily bring another 12 ships to the battle.
12 ships, willing to fight shoulder to shoulder?
for a chance to destroy the replicators once and for all?
of course.
what did you do?
what are you referring to? - There's a ship on the way.
Ah, they picked up my signal.
subspace tracking device.
Hello?
is anybody here?
what happened?
my people, they are gone.
searched the entire planet, no life-signs.
I will find them.
and we're going to help you, but you got to rest and get your strength back.
whoever did this will pay.
I will make certain of it.
I'm so sorry, teyla.
kanaan was a good man.
he would have made a wonderful father.
I really thought I could save him.
you did everything you could.
that's all anybody can ask for.
he's at peace now.
all right.
I'm ready.
he's still alive!
help me, teyla, please!
please help me!
he's still alive! Let me go!
Teyla, it's too late.
help me, teyla! Teyla!
as you know, for some time now we've been tracking what appears to be a new sickness in the pegasus galaxy.
we don't know exactly when or where it started but so far we've encountered it on seven different planets.
the KINDRED
make that eight.
we just came back from 447. They got it too.
Really? The same symptoms?
Mmm... starts with respiratory difficulty proceeds rapidly to fatal organ shut down.
Oh, it's, uh, disinfectant.
we just came back from the bio-screen, rodney.
we were wearing a hasmat the whole time, too.
Yes, well, it's better safe than sorry.
do we have any idea how it's spread?
well, that's the strange part.
most of these planets have no regular contact with each other but a few of them do have regular contact with other, neighboring planets that have been completely unaffected.
so far.
how bad is this going to get?
if I had to make a projection, I'd base it on the evidence from m1r 992.
there have been no new cases there for some time which would seem to indicate the sickness has run its course.
And?
it killed 30% of the population.
if those numbers bear out on the rest of these planets we're looking at a death-toll of about 200, 000.
that's assuming it doesn't spread any further.
has dr. Keller made any progress with her investigation?
unfortunately not, no, but she's still working on it.
what are you hiding?
I, um...
well...
I've been waiting for the right time to give this to you and what with everything that's been going on and all, I, uh...
anyway, uh...
here you go.
you didn't have to do this, rodney.
well, think of it as A...
a kind of a pre-baby present.
back on earth, there's this company that produces recordings specifically for the fetus.
the thinking is that by listening to the works of, say, a great composer while still in the womb, the baby will be born with a natural predisposition toward musical ability or in this case, science.
Yeah, I recorded some of my reflections on some of my more ground-breaking accomplishments and theories.
just a couple of hours' worth.
you should not have gone to so much trouble.
Oh, it was no trouble at all.
something wrong?
I was debating whether or not to tell anyone.
tell anyone what?
I believe I had a vision last night.
a vision?
I saw kanaan, the father of my son.
I believe that he was trying to send me a message, that he's alive and that I must not abandon the search for him and the rest of my people.
and-and this was while you were sleeping?
you think it was a dream.
well, I...
I believe it was more than that.
it did not feel like a dream.
I knew you would doubt me. I should not have said anything.
Hey, I've been cocooned inside an alien space craft, I've had another person living inside me
I've encountered not one, but two different versions of myself so who am I to judge?
if you say it was a vision, then I believe it was a vision.
I seriously doubt it was a vision.
she had them before.
she's had remote contact with the wraith, never another human.
besides, those athosians have been missing for, like, what, six months now?
you really think they're still alive?
what do you want me to do, rodney? Tell her to give up hope?
at some point, she may not have a choice.
you must help us.
how?
save us.
where are you? Where are our people?
you bought me this.
Yes.
do you remember where?
the village of croya.
is that where you are?
come find me.
she says the pendant in her vision is the same one she gave to kanaan before he disappeared.
so what's the significance?
well, uh...
I'm not sure.
well, what does she want, exactly?
well, she bought it from some guy in a village on m2s 181.
she wants to go back and check it out.
that's a peaceful trading settlement.
I'd be very surprised if they had anything to do with the disappearance of the athosians.
that's what I said, but she still wants to go.
she thinks that kanaan is sending her a message, a clue.
and what do you think?
doesn't matter.
it's teyla, and we owe her one.
okay but we're stretched pretty thin dealing with this plague.
we'll try to make it quick.
I purchased the pendant from an artisan in croya the village we are about to visit.
among the athosians, it's quite common to present such gifts as expressions of admiration and respect.
Hey, maybe I'll pick you something up while we're there.
Really?
no.
all right, so we'll ask around see if we can get some useful intel but if you even begin to sense any danger
I'll make straight for the gate, leaving you to deal with it.
all right, then.
excuse me
I'm wondering if you can tell me what happened to the artisan who used to occupy this space.
he specialized in handcrafted jewelry bracelets, pendants, chains...
he's gone.
gone?
during the sickness that took the village several weeks back.
he and some 40 others.
I'm sorry, child, he's dead.
Hey, I hear you have something.
Yeah.
I found out what's making these people sick and it's something we've encountered before.
it's a unique protein originally created by the inhabitants of a planet called hoff.
it was designed to interfere with the wraith's feeding mechanism making them immune to the process.
it also killed the feeding wraith, and half the people who took it.
that's right.
so this isn't some contagion that spreads naturally.
no.
this is mass murder.
I think we're done here.
not yet.
I've given this place the twice over.
nobody knows anything.
well, perhaps someone does, and has not yet seen fit to come forward yet.
I was guided here.
by showing me the pendant, kanaan was telling me to come to this village.
look, you're going through a tough time.
you want answers, that's understandable but you might want to consider it's clouding your judgment.
just a little.
what are you questioning, john?
my interpretation of the vision, or the vision itself?
we've been here long enough.
if there was something for us to find, we would've found it by now.
Rodney, ronon, we're heading out.
are you sure it's the same protein?
I ran a side-by-side comparison. It was almost an exact match.
almost?
we're dealing with the new and improved version.
the hoffan drug killed roughly 50% of the test subjects, and this one only kills 30%.
Yeah, it's still 30% too many.
how do the populations of eight different planets get inoculated with a drug and not even know about it?
it's possible it was administered through their food and water supply.
we're running some tests.
so who's behind this?
well, maybe the hoffans have resumed distribution of the drug but on a much larger scale.
they haven't been doing much of anything lately.
when the wraith discovered what they were up to, the whole civilization was wiped out.
well, maybe a few of them survived, and they're planning a little payback.
the random nature of this drug's distribution is clear and calculated.
it's obviously intended to throw the wraith completely off balance.
they have no way of knowing which of their food sources has been infected.
so it's just a matter of time before they become hungry and cranky.
well, I mean, I know I would.
we need to go back to hoff search what's still standing, see if we can shed some light on the situation before another planet's targeted.
let's go, rodney.
where are you?
I don't know.
who took you?
I don't know.
how can I find you?
you already know where to go to uncover the answers.
the village.
but you stopped looking.
I went.
I found nothing.
you were close.
please, teyla.
our time is running short.
we need you.
and you weren't sleeping?
I was in a meditative state, but I was most definitely awake.
there can be no doubt. This is real.
but you've already been to the planet.
we missed something. I'm certain of it.
I want to believe you, teyla, but I'm a scientist.
I'm trained to think critically.
there is a possible explanation.
kanaan has the gift, the same ability that I do.
the wraith dna.
Yes.
among my people, the gift is considered useful but it also sets one apart. It can be difficult.
kanaan was the only one who could truly understand what it felt like.
it brought you together.
it is something we have shared since childhood.
but have you ever communicated this way before?
no.
I know what this looks like, colonel and I know what everyone is thinking.
she sees what she wants to see, she believes what she wants to believe,
but I assure you, that is not the case.
all right.
when colonel sheppard gets back from hoff, we can-- - I cannot wait.
kanaan said their time is running short. I must leave immediately.
I see.
I do not need your permission, colonel.
unless you intend to restrain me.
major lorne, come in.
go ahead, colonel.
assemble your team. You'll be escorting teyla back to m2s 181.
understood.
I'm not letting you go back there alone.
thank you, colonel.
call me sam.
thank you, sam.
Rodney, come in.
go ahead.
did you find anything?
just a bunch of junk. You?
nothing.
the wraith did a pretty good number on this place.
Yeah, this is more than just random destruction.
this place used to be the repository of all hoffan knowledge.
I'd say a lot of it's just missing.
who's there?
Rodney, what's going on?
I thought I heard something.
relax.
probably just rats.
rats?
okay, if there's someone in here, you better come out.
I'm not kidding.
hang on
I'm not going to hurt you. I just want to ask you a couple of questions.
now, who are you? What are you doing here?
okay, maybe you can help me. I'm looking for some medical stuff. Books, files, equipment.
I don't know anything about that.
by the time we got here, most of the good stuff was already gone.
we're just picking through what's left.
looks like we're not the only ones here.
what do you got?
a bunch of kids going through what's left of this place.
scavengers. You think they got a hold of what we're looking for?
Hoffan research wouldn't have meant anything to them.
all right, well, if not them, then who was it?
I don't know.
one thing's for sure, whoever it was they knew exactly what they were looking for.
kind of reminds me of the flea markets they used to have back home.
every sunday, stroll down to the bay area find pretty much anything you wanted and a lot of things you didn'T.
what is it?
leave.
I will ask you once, and you will answer me truthfully.
where did you get this pendant?
from a trader.
if you like it that much, it's yours with my blessings.
you recognize it?
it belonged to kanaan.
what else did you acquire from this trader?
you know, I don't want to be difficult here but I did acquire that merchandise for a price and while I really don't mind gifting you with an item from a purely business standpoint, it really doesn't make sense for me to part with my stock
this necklace belonged to bellara.
it was a gift from her parents to mark her coming of age and this ring belonged to halling.
this trader you say you got these things from.
when's the last time you saw him?
several days ago but he comes through here quite regularly.
in fact, it's more than likely he may pay me a visit today.
it would be my pleasure to make the proper introductions.
anything?
no, the place was cleared out.
is that what I think it is?
it's getting to be a familiar sight.
what is it?
wraith subspace tracking device.
it's our old friend.
maybe he wants to talk, and maybe he just wants to lead us into an ambush.
there is always that possibility.
well, there's only one way to find out.
Aw, come on, we just got back.
sorry, rodney.
I haven't even had lunch yet.
dial it.
got some real nice merchandise for you today, my friend.
real nice.
hey there, how you doing?
you mind telling me where you got this stuff?
wake up.
look, we need to know where you got this merchandise.
I do trade so much, it's often hard to keep track of it all.
Oh yeah?
well, according to the merchant you do business with here the stuff you've been bringing in lately has been a hell of a lot nicer than your usual crap.
he said that?
Yeah, he said that.
well, there's no accounting for taste.
I can't give up my sources. They're trade secrets.
I don't give a damn about your trade secrets.
we want to know where you got this stuff.
and if I don't tell you? What are you going to do?
I recognize those uniforms, I've heard the stories.
people from atlantis, do-gooders of the galaxy.
you wouldn't hurt me.
I'm wearing no uniform.
a pregnant woman.
very intimidating.
I will inform the villers that you are a wraith worshiper and let them mete out their own justice.
let's go.
wait
I got it at an off-world dumping ground.
dumping ground?
for what?
corpses, mostly.
loose ends that need to be disappeared.
occasionally they may still have some valuables on them valuables they obviously have no use for.
this merchandise, you removed it from the dead?
no, not that merchandise.
the last time I was back at the planet
I spotted what I thought was a fresh grave, a potential new opportunity but when i dug it up, instead of finding a body
I found a box containing those items.
I suppose somebody was just trying to get rid of them.
it was odd to me at first, but I wasn't just about to
you will take us to this world.
you will show us where you found them.
of course.
whatever you say.
get him up.
Sheppard. We got something.
well, they're dead but there's no marks on them.
that's because they were poisoned...
and I suspect you already know how.
first thing we do when we get to the gate is radio back to atlantis let them know where we're going, okay?
listen, teyla
I know you're looking for answers to what happened to your people, but
I'm thinking maybe it's better if you let us check it out, okay?
major...
look, just let us scout ahead, all right?
what is that?
well, let me guess...
something they ate?
many of my fellow wraith have fallen victim to this attack on our food supply.
Yeah, it's a shame, but it's not really our problem.
from what we've been able to surmise this blow against us has been delivered at a great cost to human lives.
something you would have made your problem in the past...
unless, of course, you're responsible for the dispersal of this plague in which case, you may well consider the human lives sacrificed acceptable losses?
actually, when we were putting a list together of the most likely suspects you were at the top.
what better way to stick it to your competition?
effective, yes and admittedly creative but the truth is all of the existing wraith factions have been adversely affected by this.
our food supply has been so randomly tainted we have no way of knowing if our next meal will be our last.
all right, times are tough.
doesn't explain why you called us here.
I brought you here because...
I need your help.
I am aware you had a hand in helping the hoffans refine this drug.
I require whatever research you possess in order that I may synthesize a cure for my hive and my hive alone.
that's not going to happen.
you always say that, but you always come around.
Yeah, well, this is different.
we're still a little upset over the whole earth conquest thing.
I had no part in that.
actually, in an indirect way, you did.
the wraith who led the attack was able to access the midway station with information you stole on your last visit to atlantis.
information he stole from me in turn, so, in a way, we were both victims but let's save our commiserations for another time.
I have a proposal.
let's hear it.
in exchange for this information
I will give you the identity of the individual responsible for dispersing this poison and killing both wraith and human alike.
a couple of minutes ago, you thought we did it.
there are only two parties who possess the resources and capabilities to launch such an attack.
if you are not responsible, then by process of elimination there can be only one.
wraith faction has been hit which makes it extremely unlikely that any of them are responsible.
when we told him we weren't the guys behind it, he said there can only be one other.
and you think you know who he's talking about?
the wraith that dr. Beckett converted into a human?
well, temporarily converted.
eventually, he became a kind of a human-wraith hybrid.
the other wraith didn't want anything to do with him so he's been kind of holding a little bit of a grudge ever since.
he's not a big fan of humans, either.
no, for him, the hoffan drug is the perfect weapon.
still, this is just speculation.
I mean, do we have any proof?
well, not really, but even if we did, we'd have no way of finding him.
we can go back to todd, see if he's got something more than a name.
well, wait, you're not seriously thinking of giving him our research on the hoffan protein?
well, why not?
because we'd effectively be giving the wraith the means to reproduce the drug and potentially infect and kill millions
theoretically, yes but practically, it really wouldn't be in their best interest to poison their own food supply regardless of whether our research helped them come up with an antidote or not.
no, I think the more likely scenario is that they find an antidote that works as a short-term solution to the existing threat then they work on weaponizing the protein.
you know, coming up with a more effective delivery system one that cuts out the middle man in this case, the human victims.
no, what we're doing is giving them the means to kill each other off.
so, when you, uh...
put it that way, giving them our research could be a good thing.
incoming wormhole.
major, where's teyla?
why am I here?
what do you want?
answer me!
I'm disappointed.
I was expecting a little more gratitude, after everything I went through to arrange this...
family reunion.
reunion?
my people...
you took them?
where are they?
what have you done with them?
they're alive and well and working with me toward the common goal we all share.
what are you talking about?
the extermination of the wraith.
I'm building an army that will soon replace them as the dominant race in this galaxy.
an army of monsters.
I'll admit my early attempts were a little...
crude but that's all changed now.
I've refined the retrovirus to create the perfect balance ability well beyond any normal human, but without the one weakness that will be the downfall of the wraith.
the need to feed.
it was you.
you're the one responsible for spreading the hoffan drug.
consider it the opening salvo in a much broader assault.
how were you able to discover the drug?
how were you able to refine it?
I had help.
wait! Where are my people?
Oh, don't mind them.
they're just here to help with the clean-up.
I assume you've agreed to my terms?
not exactly.
you do not wish to know who's responsible for these unfortunate events?
we already know.
at least, we have a pretty good guess.
we call him michael.
don't ask why.
he used to be a wraith. Now he's A...
I'm not sure what the hell he is.
I know the one of whom you speak, and I believe you are correct.
confirmation, without us giving you anything. That's very generous.
obviously there's more you want from me, or you would not have come.
maybe we just came to kill you.
did you?
unfortunately, no.
well, there's always next time.
one of our people was taken by a dart today.
I suppose she's already made some lucky wraith a very tasty meal.
this was no culling.
she was targeted. Someone set a trap.
and you suspect this... what do you call him?
well, if not, the timing's a hell of a coincidence.
we need you to tap your intel sources find something useful.
this tablet has the address of an off-world relay station.
if you leave a message for us, we'll get it.
it also has our research on the hoffan drug.
just enough to whet your appetite.
you find something we can use, we'll give you the rest.
well, I'll see what I can do.
I understand you're refusing to take food.
it's not poisoned, if that's what you're worried about.
take it.
you need to keep up your strength.
what do you care about my well-being?
I care a great deal.
I may not be foolish enough to consider us friends but we do have a history...
and even though you've betrayed me repeatedly you're still the only one, human or wraith who's ever come close to understanding what I've been through.
Really?
we're not that different, teyla.
you're a human with wraith dna.
a hybrid, just like me.
I'm no murderer.
you kill to protect yourself and your own, so do I.
of course, circumstances require me to do it on a slightly larger scale but the principle is still the same.
you're insane.
spite me all you want but don't do it at the expense of the child.
my child is of no concern to you.
on the contrary
I have great plans for him.
how can you eat right now?
are you kidding?
this is the first decent meal I've had all day.
besides, it's not going to help teyla at all starving ourselves.
I'm just trying to keep my strength up. I suggest you two do the same.
Hey, we'll find her.
I've just got to do something.
Colonel...
looks like todd came through for you.
he did?
you've got a message from the relay station.
apparently there's a rumor going around amongst certain wraith worshipers about one of our people being held captive.
you've got the coordinates.
all right, I'm going to need lorne and his team.
he's already volunteered.
you'll gate to the nearest planet, where the daedalus is enroute to pick you up.
let's go.
I told you, I'm not hungry.
what has he done to you?
kanaan, it's me. Teyla.
I came for you, just like you asked.
like I asked.
I was the one in your visions.
appropriately disguised, of course.
you're lying.
I reached across 10, 000 light years of space and touched your mind.
there is more of a bond between us than you know.
once the child is born, the bond will grow even stronger.
enjoy your reunion.
kanaan, you must help me.
you must help our child.
please, kanaan.
the child will serve the cause then one day soon, the galaxy will be ours.
Colonel...
approaching target destination.
drop us out.
Yes, sir.
we're unable to get a lock on her subcutaneous transmitter.
no surprise there. I'm sure michael got rid of that.
guess we'll have to do things the hard way.
good, let's do it.
all right, stay in touch.
Yes, sir.
let's move out.
sir, I'm picking up another ship.
it's a wraith cruiser, sir.
shields up.
return fire!
Sheppard, this is daedalus. We've been engaged by a wraith cruiser.
how's it going?
more than holding our own, but you could pick up the pace.
Where's your boss?
you're too early.
what the hell does that mean?
we're expecting him back.
he's on his way with an important prisoner.
this is sheppard, come in.
Daedalus, do you read?
Sheppard, this is daedalus.
do not destroy the enemy ship. I repeat do not destroy the enemy ship. Teyla may be on board.
did you hear me? Teyla may be on board!
we heard you. Can you cripple it?
it's possible, sir. It's already sustained some heavy damage.
sir, the enemy is attempting a retreat.
target the engines!
I'm sorry, sir.
bad news, sheppard.
the cruiser made the jump to hyperspace.
it's gone.
any sign of her, sir?
she's not here.
are you sure?
that guard was protecting something.
Finally! It's about bloody time.
what took you so long?
to BE CONTINUED
it can't be a storm.
it stretches across the whole horizon.
this must cover 20 percent of the planet.
if you want everyone to live, you gate them off world.
within the next hour, there will be less than 10 people on Atlantis.
we cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.
what is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?
electricity.
Atlantis is designed to withstand substantial lightning strikes.
there are lightning rods all over the city.
if we disable the grounding stations, that energy could conceivably be used to charge up the shield generators.
we decided to wait out the storm in the jumper.
from what I can ascertain, a small Genii strike force has gated in.
why are you doing this?
you are in possession of supplies we vitally need...
the C-4 explosive, all of your medical supplies.
as of right now, we are in control of Atlantis.
say goodbye to Dr. Weir.
and now the conclusion...
Kolya, don't do this!
how is this going to help you get what you want?
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.
you can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.
she's right, commander.
there are codes required to activate the shield, codes that only she knows. You can't do it without her.
you can't do this without me either.
I mean, we're a package deal.
you take us out of the equation, and you don't have an end-game.
granted, that's a chess term.
my point is we're the only ones who can fix the grounding station.
we're the only ones who can activate the shield.
we're the only ones that can solve problems I can't even think of yet.
you kill either one of us, and you don't get what you want.
that's how important we are.
Rodney, he gets it.
I appreciate your...
you're an asset we need to complete this mission.
you stepped in front of a gun for me.
don't thank me just yet.
we've got two and a half hours till the storm hits, and unless our luck changes drastically, this city is going to be obliterated.
major Sheppard, how's this for credibility?
Weir is dead.
I'm going to kill you.
maybe.
stay out of my way, or McKay will join her.
Team24 and SG-66 for seriestele.net and Forom.com Transcript: Raceman
this is amazing.
there you are.
we're here.
take two men, head there.
four levels down.
that's Sheppard.
Yes, sir.
let's go.
you're with me.
he's heading out of the hallways.
holy Grail - That's it!
what are you doing, man?
adding weight to the puddle jumper by resetting its inertial dampeners.
you shouldn't screw with those controls. We're heavy enough.
can't be too careful.
Yes, you can. You can be way too careful.
there's no chance we're going to blow away here.
let it go.
that should be enough.
how much longer until the storm passes?
I guess we're barely halfway through, but there's no way to tell.
you know, I hope they're okay, too.
what's this then?
we're through it?
we can't be.
it's not possible.
he's moving.
are you sure we're on the right level?
where did he go?
he can probably hear your stupid questions.
Oh, will you look at this?
now, that is just...
that is never going to be useful again.
I should be able to bypass the switching station entirely.
good. How long?
it's not half as bad as it looks.
I'd say 15, 20 minutes tops.
do it.
Dr. Weir, I need you to...
right, of course.
keep that there.
we're in the eye.
right.
has to be.
the eye?
dead center of the storm.
the storm swirls around a 20 to 40 kilometer-wide area.
then this calm will not last?
no, in fact, in about 10 minutes, it's going to get very ugly again.
well, come on. We have to help the major.
we can take off, but landing is twice as hard, believe me.
what if the storm's reached Atlantis?
has it?
not just yet, but it will anytime now.
stop wasting time. Let's go. Let's go.
we would still have to fly straight through the storm, Lieutenant. It's insanity.
this is not insanity. This is a spaceship.
we can fly up and over.
straight up and down?
straight up and down.
I'm a bloody medical doctor, not a magician.
you can do it.
if we can help, we must.
Oh, crap.
20 feet away.
five feet.
there's so much smoke.
which way?
you're right on top of him.
yeah? I think I would see him if I was.
stand by.
do you see him?
did you get him?
report.
commander.
Yes, Sora.
ladon had been leading three of our men on a reconnaissance mission.
it seems major Sheppard has killed three more of our strike team.
tell everyone to move back to the control room.
right away, sir.
why did you tell him you could have this fixed in 15 to 20 minutes?
Oh, I don't know.
maybe so he wouldn't kill us.
I understand that, but once the shield is operational, we won't be very useful, now, will we?
why did you let me tell him I could fix it in 15 or 20?
you just have to stall him some more.
well, I just told him how long it'll take.
find another problem with it.
tell them that the power loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout, something.
isn't jiving?
Rodney, you get my point.
though from the sounds of it, if we give major Sheppard enough time, it seems like he can take care of the rest of them on his own.
radio chief Cowen.
tell him to send reinforcements, a full company.
if you 're hoping major Sheppard can diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.
okay. What would McKay do?
you're coming in a little steep, Doc.
thank you, Lieutenant. - I'm very aware of that.
I told you not to play with the inertial dampeners.
I'm pretty sure I got them back where they were.
why don't you try to contact the major?
first, you got to get us in there.
what are you up to?
what's he done now?
I should have seen this coming.
commander.
major Sheppard has cut power to the control room.
how?
Atlantis is being powered by five small generators, each responsible for a separate area of the city.
major Sheppard has just disabled the one generator that powers stargate operations in this tower.
now, we still have most primary operations.
we have definitely lost all secondary systems.
can you still track Sheppard?
no.
then we have no idea where he is now.
no, sir.
is the control room secure?
Yes, commander.
I suggest we send some men to guard the remaining generators.
No!
he's trying to divide us into manageable numbers.
just hold stargate operations until the reinforcements arrive.
understood.
if he asks what's taking so long, you have to do all the talking, okay?
you'll be fine.
no, no, I won't.
I'm a terrible bluffer. I've lost small fortunes at poker.
my eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately. It's not pretty.
what's our progress?
we've hit a small snag.
we're just running a diagnostic to make sure we can interface our codes properly.
it's a small snag, small snag.
it's, like, half an hour at the most.
commander Sheppard has just disabled another generator.
Yes, Ladon, I am aware of that.
he's cut the power to grounding station three.
can it still be repaired?
without power? No.
can the plan be completed without it?
the other three grounding stations have been disabled.
no. No, it's just not good enough.
look, by uncoupling the grounding stations, it means that when lightning strikes the city, the electricity will have nowhere to go.
if I could channel the electricity properly through the conduits that line the city corridors, we should be able to power the shield...
temporarily.
if any of these grounding stations are left active, a sizable amount of electricity will find its way to ground and no shield.
commander, the storm has not slowed its pace.
we have little time to get the shields activated.
we should re-evaluate our goal. Perhaps.
we still have more than enough time to complete our objectives.
then I must strongly advise that we send men down to repair the deactivated generators and to guard the remaining active ones.
agreed, teams of two, but I want you to watch over the control room.
as soon as the reinforcements arrive, have them take Sheppard with overwhelming force.
understood.
perhaps we can be under shelter while we wait.
I'm liable to catch a cold like that...
I take it that's a no.
remain here and be still.
I will return for you.
where are we going?
armory.
are you sure...
you know you're always saying you're not military. - you don't have to take orders? - Hi.
now you do.
so long as it's temporary.
should we try to contact the major now?
the Genii may be monitoring our frequencies.
we do not want to alert them of our presence.
life-signs detector.
these wee dots don't tell us much about who's who.
how do we know which one's the major?
he'll be the dot getting rid of the other dots.
great.
how many should we expect?
a full company, 60 or more.
I don't know how we were expected to take a facility this size with any less.
it was supposed to be a raid to retrieve what was rightfully ours.
with me.
come on.
reinforcements are arriving now, Commander.
have them secure stargate operations and report back to me.
Yes, Commander.
secure the area.
then I want you to...
shut it off. Ladon!
stop him!
this is Sora.
stop sending the reinforcements.
the stargate shield has been raised.
Sheppard has raised the gate shield.
shut it down.
turn it off.
I don't know how.
ladon is unconscious.
tell her the procedure.
I can't. I don't know what he's done!
tell her.
well, he must have entered his personal command code.
what is it?
I don't know!
only Sheppard would know it.
trust me, I'm not that brave.
I would help you if I could.
you have the command codes.
it's no use.
it's over.
the gate has shut down.
there are no more men coming.
how many men made it?
five.
five of 60.
you still need me if you want the city.
you still need both of us.
he's entered some sort of security code to lock down the gate.
just give me some time.
I should be able to crack it.
do it.
commander?
he thinks he can have the gate fixed.
did Athor's son make it through the gate?
I'm sorry?
his name is Idos.
did he make it?
no, sir.
over 60 men killed.
defending his home and his people, Commander, as we would.
when can more reinforcements be sent?
it will take time, perhaps an hour.
unacceptable!
Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable, because by then, we will be in the full force of the storm.
probably sooner.
major Sheppard, I have a proposition for you.
do you recognize that voice?
no.
Kolya, I'm having a hard time keeping up. What's the score again?
my men have informed me that not only have you disabled some crucial generators, but you've stolen key components which make it impossible for them to be restored.
Yeah, I did that.
there are two flaws in your plan.
I'm always open to constructive criticism.
one, the assumption I would believe you'd rather destroy the city than let it fall to us is childish.
doesn't sound like me.
second, if and when I determine Atlantis unsalvageable, doctors Weir and McKay become obsolete.
Weir is alive?
Dr. McKay was able to make a strong case for keeping her alive.
let me talk to her.
we're both here.
it's good to hear your voice.
Yeah, it's good to hear.
we have less than one hour before the storm hits full-force.
if the power is not returned to grounding station three within the next 10 minutes, Dr. Weir dies.
again, you mean.
her death will buy you another 10 minutes, after which, should the power still be out, Dr. McKay dies.
we will then leave with what we can, and the city will be destroyed.
well, that's not enough time.
if you don't mind destroying Atlantis, stay where you are for the next 20 minutes.
starting now.
don't load up so much. It'll slow you down.
two extra magazines each.
all right.
what do you need that for?
anything I see moving is going to get shot.
so, what if it's the major?
then he'll get hit with a wraith stunner instead of a P-90.
what if he sees us first?
he'll probably hear you first.
are you telling me to shut up again?
again.
right.
let's go.
which naquadah generator would power the third grounding station?
you're asking me?
whichever one it is, it's going to be an ambush.
we've got to be there.
there's one here.
is that a guess? - Aye, but it makes sense.
it's the closest.
all right, I'll take point.
Teyla, you're on our six. You...
don't open your mouth until I say so.
only shoot at what I tell you to shoot at.
you don't have to be so bloody pushy.
that's an order.
stop.
look, your boss wanted me to turn this thing back on, so I think we should do what he says.
be quiet.
we have him.
keep him alive.
I'm on my way.
is it the wrong one?
Yeah, I'd say so.
Oh, don't you blame me for this.
I'm not an engineer.
I really only have a basic understanding of how Rodney and his team configured the power, so don't expect me...
you just can't stop talking, can you?
you just can't help yourself. No matter what I say...
and you're such a nice young lad until you're put in charge, you cheeky little bugger.
wait...
what if this is the right station, and the major has not made it back yet?
Oh, she's right.
no. No, this one's working.
how much time?
two minutes.
there's five generators.
it's not this one.
it can't be the one that powers the control tower.
that leaves three.
we've got a one in three chance of guessing the right one.
we may just be walking into the very ambush we're trying to save him from.
we're not far from a transporter.
are any of the generators near a transport station?
Aye. There's two.
well, let's go.
okay, if I remember correctly...
remember correctly.
I think they are here and here.
which one are you sure is next to a power generator?
okay, just give me a moment. - No moments. Pick one.
I'm the one you're going to blame if it's wrong.
we have to go now.
here.
I don't mean to be a bad prisoner or anything, but Kolya is going to kill one of my people if I don't get this thing back on in time, so...
turn around.
you turn around.
what?
well, if I have to turn around, you should turn around.
what the hell took you so long?
well, there's this storm... - Just hold that thought.
it seems major Sheppard wants you to live.
let's get back to work.
you okay, sir?
I've been better. Been worse.
my shoulder's a little sore.
do you want me to take a look at that?
I'll take a recheck when that'll be out.
we should leave this area. More Genii will be on their way.
I couldn't agree more.
if this doesn't work...
it will.
I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...
it will.
I'm sure it will, but in the unlikely event that it doesn't...
please.
fantastic.
Oh, thank god.
McKay figures he can harness the storm's lightning to fire up the shield.
just lightning?
sg teams have done it before to power a stargate.
there's a big difference between a stargate...
I didn't say you could talk.
now...
I need to run the subroutine that will convince the input buffers in the shield generator to attenuate the raw electricity into usable power.
I can only do that from the control room.
that's where Dr. Weir's codes come in.
Yes.
only primary systems are operating.
Sheppard has to repair the other generator.
the shield's considered a primary system.
we're good to go, but we have to go now, I mean now.
I mean everybody, all your men.
what does that have to do with my men?
now that the grounding station's been deactivated, electricity will be free to flow through the conduits that line every corridor in the city.
what kind of a plan is that?
a Rodney McKay kind of plan.
it's all we've got.
and it leaves us only one place to go.
where the Genii will also be.
now, the control room and stargate operations are shielded, but the rest of the city...
once the lightning starts to hit...
anybody left in the hallways is as good as dead.
why haven't you responded?
she's here, Commander.
who?
Teyla. She and two others have joined Sheppard.
why wasn't this reported sooner?
fall back to the control room immediately.
she's just out of my reach.
if I am patient...
I gave you an order.
she left my father for dead.
the storm is upon us. The city is no longer safe.
I don't care.
fall back.
you have my word. Your father will be avenged.
by me. - Sora
will the young hunters in the jumper be safe?
the jumper bay's part of stargate operations.
they'll be protected.
then maybe that's where we should be headed.
if the shield goes up over the city, Weir and McKay are expendable to Kolya.
we got to take the control room first.
would he really kill them just because they are of no further use to him?
no, he'd kill them to punish me.
now, here's the deal...
ford and I get into position, just below the control room stairs.
Teyla and Beckett head to the jumper bay.
I intend to fight alongside you...
and I intend you to fight with us.
once you get in position, lower the ship into the gate room, open the weapons pods.
that should create enough distraction for Ford and me to go in.
we take back the control room, get the shield up.
city's saved.
Weir and McKay saved.
we take the rest of the day off.
sounds like a plan, sir.
stay on channel two. Let's move out.
you're not going to need that thing.
shoot to kill.
the winds are getting stronger and the wave heights are growing.
we need to keep stalling.
what for?
major Sheppard is still out there.
if you activate...
now, McKay.
it's done.
Dr. Weir, I need you to enter your code now.
Yes, of course.
yes?
and the second sequence?
I'll be glad when this following-orders business is over...
drop it!
I'll kill him.
I would hate to kill you so quickly.
I have known you for almost all your life.
why are you doing this?
you left him to die...
your father killed an innocent.
he alerted the wraith to our presence.
and you escaped.
if I am to die by your hand, Sora...
I die knowing there was nothing
I could have done to have saved Tyrus.
we're in position.
this isn't right.
what?
Teyla and Beckett should have easily made it to the jumper bay first.
they should have been waiting for us.
Teyla, what's your position?
this was my father's.
it was handed down from his father.
if you want to fight this way, Sora, I will win.
you will have avenged no one.
we'll see.
engage the shield.
I'm almost finished.
a massive wave is approaching from the west.
without the shield...
we're starting to get hits on the northern pier.
routing power to the corridor... Now.
now.
now.
okay, this is a problem.
what?
look, I told you this was a long shot from the beginning.
we already have serious flooding on the north and west piers.
it's no use. The city conduits can't handle this kind of raw power.
is any power getting to the shield generator?
nominal amounts. Nowhere near enough.
you said this would work.
I don't know if you noticed or not, but I am extremely arrogant man who tends to think all of his plans will work.
idiot!
Hey, this was a long shot at best.
why else would we evacuate the city?
it was always our intention to dial out in case this didn't work.
within minutes, Atlantis will fail.
you can leave and survive, or you can go down with the city.
you choose.
we're just not getting enough power to the shield generators.
are you really going to sacrifice the lives of all of your men on the off-chance that this city won't be completely destroyed?
open the stargate.
start evacuating the remaining men.
you're making the right decision.
you're coming with us.
what?
you'll both serve the Genii as payment for what you've done.
Oh, for what we've done?
change of plan.
you got McKay.
seriously, this is a bad idea.
you saw what happened to my last plan.
this is not what...
you're not going anywhere.
I will shoot you if you don't let her go.
and risk hurting Dr. Weir?
I'm not aiming at her.
find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure that's all of them.
sorry about that. I had to...
you okay?
no.
you will be. Come on.
wait! What are you doing?
I thought I'd activate the shield and save the day.
you got something else in mind?
Teyla and Beckett are still out there.
tracking system's down.
there's a tsunami headed towards the city, Lieutenant.
in two and a half minutes, they're dead.
then we give them two minutes.
this is not what your father would have wanted.
our people were destined to be allies...
Teyla and Beckett, fall back to the control room.
this must end... now!
then end it.
there's no more time.
we either lose them or we lose the city.
Rodney, go!
going!
what's happening?
it's working, It just needs to build up enough power for the shield to activate.
wait for it.
you're just in time to see how this ends, huh?
now.
nice work, Rodney.
did you ever doubt me?
Yes, several times.
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.
what do you want to do with her?
I don't know yet.
we'll keep her locked up for the time being.
maybe releasing her back to the Genii would help ease tension between us.
you're extremely optimistic. You know that?
you think so?
everyone getting back okay?
looks like it.
how fares our city?
well, we've begun pumping out the lower levels of the east pier, which was flooded.
there is structural damage, nothing too serious.
Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion.
I mean, look at this. I had to do this myself.
still, on the bright side, I've had my first decent meal in 24 hours, so all things considered, I would say we are just fine.
you say these things happen every 20 years, right?
that's what they tell us.
it can't be a storm.
it stretches across the whole horizon.
this must cover 20 percent of the planet.
if you want everyone to live, you gate them off world.
within the next hour, there will be less than 10 people on Atlantis.
we cannot afford to pass up this opportunity.
what is the one thing keeping us from having a shield?
electricity.
Atlantis is designed to withstand substantial lightning strikes.
there are lightning rods all over the city.
if we disable the grounding stations, that energy could conceivably be used to charge up the shield generators.
we decided to wait out the storm in the jumper.
from what I can ascertain, a small Genii strike force has gated in.
why are you doing this?
you are in possession of supplies we vitally need...
the C-4 explosive, all of your medical supplies.
as of right now, we are in control of Atlantis.
say goodbye to Dr. Weir.
and now the conclusion...
Kolya, don't do this!
how is this going to help you get what you want?
Sheppard put you in this position, not me.
you can't do this. This is crazy. You need her.
she's right, commander.
there are codes required to activate the shield, codes that only she knows. You can't do it without her.
you can't do this without me either.
I mean, we're a package deal.
you take us out of the equation, and you don't have an end-game.
granted, that's a chess term.
my point is we're the only ones who can fix the grounding station.
we're the only ones who can activate the shield.
we're the only ones that can solve problems I can't even think of yet.
you kill either one of us, and you don't get what you want.
that's how important we are.
Rodney, he gets it.
I appreciate your...
you're an asset we need to complete this mission.
you stepped in front of a gun for me.
don't thank me just yet.
we've got two and a half hours till the storm hits, and unless our luck changes drastically, this city is going to be obliterated.
major Sheppard, how's this for credibility?
Weir is dead.
I'm going to kill you.
maybe.
stay out of my way, or McKay will join her.
Team24 and SG-66 for seriestele.net and Forom.com Transcript: Raceman
this is amazing.
there you are.
we're here.
take two men, head there.
four levels down.
that's Sheppard.
Yes, sir.
let's go.
you're with me.
he's heading out of the hallways.
holy Grail - That's it!
what are you doing, man?
adding weight to the puddle jumper by resetting its inertial dampeners.
you shouldn't screw with those controls. We're heavy enough.
can't be too careful.
Yes, you can. You can be way too careful.
there's no chance we're going to blow away here.
let it go.
that should be enough.
how much longer until the storm passes?
I guess we're barely halfway through, but there's no way to tell.
you know, I hope they're okay, too.
what's this then?
we're through it?
we can't be.
it's not possible.
he's moving.
are you sure we're on the right level?
where did he go?
he can probably hear your stupid questions.
Oh, will you look at this?
now, that is just...
that is never going to be useful again.
I should be able to bypass the switching station entirely.
good. How long?
it's not half as bad as it looks.
I'd say 15, 20 minutes tops.
do it.
Dr. Weir, I need you to...
right, of course.
keep that there.
we're in the eye.
right.
has to be.
the eye?
dead center of the storm.
the storm swirls around a 20 to 40 kilometer-wide area.
then this calm will not last?
no, in fact, in about 10 minutes, it's going to get very ugly again.
well, come on. We have to help the major.
we can take off, but landing is twice as hard, believe me.
what if the storm's reached Atlantis?
has it?
not just yet, but it will anytime now.
stop wasting time. Let's go. Let's go.
we would still have to fly straight through the storm, Lieutenant. It's insanity.
this is not insanity. This is a spaceship.
we can fly up and over.
straight up and down?
straight up and down.
I'm a bloody medical doctor, not a magician.
you can do it.
if we can help, we must.
Oh, crap.
20 feet away.
five feet.
there's so much smoke.
which way?
you're right on top of him.
yeah? I think I would see him if I was.
stand by.
do you see him?
did you get him?
report.
commander.
Yes, Sora.
ladon had been leading three of our men on a reconnaissance mission.
it seems major Sheppard has killed three more of our strike team.
tell everyone to move back to the control room.
right away, sir.
why did you tell him you could have this fixed in 15 to 20 minutes?
Oh, I don't know.
maybe so he wouldn't kill us.
I understand that, but once the shield is operational, we won't be very useful, now, will we?
why did you let me tell him I could fix it in 15 or 20?
you just have to stall him some more.
well, I just told him how long it'll take.
find another problem with it.
tell them that the power loop interface isn't jiving with your walkabout, something.
isn't jiving?
Rodney, you get my point.
though from the sounds of it, if we give major Sheppard enough time, it seems like he can take care of the rest of them on his own.
radio chief Cowen.
tell him to send reinforcements, a full company.
if you 're hoping major Sheppard can diminish our numbers, you are mistaken.
okay. What would McKay do?
you're coming in a little steep, Doc.
thank you, Lieutenant. - I'm very aware of that.
I told you not to play with the inertial dampeners.
I'm pretty sure I got them back where they were.
why don't you try to contact the major?
first, you got to get us in there.
what are you up to?
what's he done now?
I should have seen this coming.
commander.
major Sheppard has cut power to the control room.
how?
Atlantis is being powered by five small generators, each responsible for a separate area of the city.
major Sheppard has just disabled the one generator that powers stargate operations in this tower.
now, we still have most primary operations.
we have definitely lost all secondary systems.
can you still track Sheppard?
no.
then we have no idea where he is now.
no, sir.
is the control room secure?
Yes, commander.
I suggest we send some men to guard the remaining generators.
No!
he's trying to divide us into manageable numbers.
just hold stargate operations until the reinforcements arrive.
understood.
if he asks what's taking so long, you have to do all the talking, okay?
you'll be fine.
no, no, I won't.
I'm a terrible bluffer. I've lost small fortunes at poker.
my eye twitches. I laugh inappropriately. It's not pretty.
what's our progress?
we've hit a small snag.
we're just running a diagnostic to make sure we can interface our codes properly.
it's a small snag, small snag.
it's, like, half an hour at the most.
commander Sheppard has just disabled another generator.
Yes, Ladon, I am aware of that.
he's cut the power to grounding station three.
can it still be repaired?
without power? No.
can the plan be completed without it?
the other three grounding stations have been disabled.
no. No, it's just not good enough.
look, by uncoupling the grounding stations, it means that when lightning strikes the city, the electricity will have nowhere to go.
if I could channel the electricity properly through the conduits that line the city corridors, we should be able to power the shield...
temporarily.
if any of these grounding stations are left active, a sizable amount of electricity will find its way to ground and no shield.
commander, the storm has not slowed its pace.
we have little time to get the shields activated.
we should re-evaluate our goal. Perhaps.
we still have more than enough time to complete our objectives.
then I must strongly advise that we send men down to repair the deactivated generators and to guard the remaining active ones.
agreed, teams of two, but I want you to watch over the control room.
as soon as the reinforcements arrive, have them take Sheppard with overwhelming force.
understood.
perhaps we can be under shelter while we wait.
I'm liable to catch a cold like that...
I take it that's a no.
remain here and be still.
I will return for you.
where are we going?
armory.
are you sure...
you know you're always saying you're not military. - you don't have to take orders? - Hi.
now you do.
so long as it's temporary.
should we try to contact the major now?
the Genii may be monitoring our frequencies.
we do not want to alert them of our presence.
life-signs detector.
these wee dots don't tell us much about who's who.
how do we know which one's the major?
he'll be the dot getting rid of the other dots.
great.
how many should we expect?
a full company, 60 or more.
I don't know how we were expected to take a facility this size with any less.
it was supposed to be a raid to retrieve what was rightfully ours.
with me.
come on.
reinforcements are arriving now, Commander.
have them secure stargate operations and report back to me.
Yes, Commander.
secure the area.
then I want you to...
shut it off. Ladon!
stop him!
this is Sora.
stop sending the reinforcements.
the stargate shield has been raised.
Sheppard has raised the gate shield.
shut it down.
turn it off.
I don't know how.
ladon is unconscious.
tell her the procedure.
I can't. I don't know what he's done!
tell her.
well, he must have entered his personal command code.
what is it?
I don't know!
only Sheppard would know it.
trust me, I'm not that brave.
I would help you if I could.
you have the command codes.
it's no use.
it's over.
the gate has shut down.
there are no more men coming.
how many men made it?
five.
five of 60.
you still need me if you want the city.
you still need both of us.
he's entered some sort of security code to lock down the gate.
just give me some time.
I should be able to crack it.
do it.
commander?
he thinks he can have the gate fixed.
did Athor's son make it through the gate?
I'm sorry?
his name is Idos.
did he make it?
no, sir.
over 60 men killed.
defending his home and his people, Commander, as we would.
when can more reinforcements be sent?
it will take time, perhaps an hour.
unacceptable!
Yes, Commander, it is unacceptable, because by then, we will be in the full force of the storm.
probably sooner.
major Sheppard, I have a proposition for you.
do you recognize that voice?
no.
Kolya, I'm having a hard time keeping up. What's the score again?
my men have informed me that not only have you disabled some crucial generators, but you've stolen key components which make it impossible for them to be restored.
Yeah, I did that.
there are two flaws in your plan.
I'm always open to constructive criticism.
one, the assumption I would believe you'd rather destroy the city than let it fall to us is childish.

second, if and when I determine Atlantis unsalvageable, doctors Weir and McKay become obsolete.
Weir is alive?
Dr. McKay was able to make a strong case for keeping her alive.
let me talk to her.
we're both here.
it's good to hear your voice.
Yeah, it's good to hear.
we have less than one hour before the storm hits full-force.
if the power is not returned to grounding station three within the next 10 minutes, Dr. Weir dies.
again, you mean.
her death will buy you another 10 minutes, after which, should the power still be out, Dr. McKay dies.
we will then leave with what we can, and the city will be destroyed.
well, that's not enough time.
if you don't mind destroying Atlantis, stay where you are for the next 20 minutes.
starting now.
don't load up so much. It'll slow you down.
two extra magazines each.
all right.
what do you need that for?
anything I see moving is going to get shot.
so, what if it's the major?
then he'll get hit with a wraith stunner instead of a P-90.
what if he sees us first?

let's go.
which naquadah generator would power the third grounding station?

what if this is the right station, and the major has not made it back yet?
Oh, she's right.
no. No, this one's working.
how much time?
two minutes.
there's five generators.
it's not this one.
it can't be the one that powers the control tower.
that leaves three.
we've got a one in three chance of guessing the right one.
we may just be walking into the very ambush we're trying to save him from.
we're not far from a transporter.
are any of the generators near a transport station?
Aye. There's two.
well, let's go.
okay, if I remember correctly...
remember correctly.
I think they are here and here.
which one are you sure is next to a power generator?
okay, just give me a moment. - No moments. Pick one.
I'm the one you're going to blame if it's wrong.
we have to go now.
here.
I don't mean to be a bad prisoner or anything, but Kolya is going to kill one of my people if I don't get this thing back on in time, so...
turn around.
you turn around.
what?
well, if I have to turn around, you should turn around.
what the hell took you so long?
well, there's this storm... - Just hold that thought.
it seems major Sheppard wants you to live.
let's get back to work.
you okay, sir?
I've been better. Been worse.
my shoulder's a little sore.
do you want me to take a look at that?
I'll take a recheck when that'll be out.
we should leave this area. More Genii will be on their way.
I couldn't agree more.
if this doesn't work...
it will.
I'm just saying, if it doesn't work...
it will.
I'm sure it will, but in the unlikely event that it doesn't...
please.
fantastic.
Oh, thank god.
McKay figures he can harness the storm's lightning to fire up the shield.
just lightning?
sg teams have done it before to power a stargate.
there's a big difference between a stargate...
I didn't say you could talk.
now...
I need to run the subroutine that will convince the input buffers in the shield generator to attenuate the raw electricity into usable power.
I can only do that from the control room.
that's where Dr. Weir's codes come in.
Yes.
only primary systems are operating.
Sheppard has to repair the other generator.
the shield's considered a primary system.
we're good to go, but we have to go now, I mean now.
I mean everybody, all your men.
what does that have to do with my men?
now that the grounding station's been deactivated, electricity will be free to flow through the conduits that line every corridor in the city.
what kind of a plan is that?
a Rodney McKay kind of plan.
it's all we've got.
and it leaves us only one place to go.
where the Genii will also be.
now, the control room and stargate operations are shielded, but the rest of the city...
once the lightning starts to hit...
anybody left in the hallways is as good as dead.
why haven't you responded?
she's here, Commander.
who?
Teyla. She and two others have joined Sheppard.
why wasn't this reported sooner?
fall back to the control room immediately.
she's just out of my reach.
if I am patient...
I gave you an order.
she left my father for dead.
the storm is upon us. The city is no longer safe.
I don't care.
fall back.
you have my word. Your father will be avenged.
by me. - Sora
will the young hunters in the jumper be safe?
the jumper bay's part of stargate operations.
they'll be protected.
then maybe that's where we should be headed.
if the shield goes up over the city, Weir and McKay are expendable to Kolya.
we got to take the control room first.
would he really kill them just because they are of no further use to him?
no, he'd kill them to punish me.
now, here's the deal...
ford and I get into position, just below the control room stairs.
Teyla and Beckett head to the jumper bay.
I intend to fight alongside you...
and I intend you to fight with us.
once you get in position, lower the ship into the gate room, open the weapons pods.
that should create enough distraction for Ford and me to go in.
we take back the control room, get the shield up.
city's saved.
Weir and McKay saved.
we take the rest of the day off.
sounds like a plan, sir.
stay on channel two. Let's move out.
you're not going to need that thing.
shoot to kill.
the winds are getting stronger and the wave heights are growing.
we need to keep stalling.
what for?
major Sheppard is still out there.
if you activate...
now, McKay.
it's done.
Dr. Weir, I need you to enter your code now.
Yes, of course.
yes?
and the second sequence?
I'll be glad when this following-orders business is over...
drop it!
I'll kill him.
I would hate to kill you so quickly.
I have known you for almost all your life.
why are you doing this?
you left him to die...
your father killed an innocent.
he alerted the wraith to our presence.
and you escaped.
if I am to die by your hand, Sora...
I die knowing there was nothing
I could have done to have saved Tyrus.
we're in position.
this isn't right.
what?
Teyla and Beckett should have easily made it to the jumper bay first.
they should have been waiting for us.
Teyla, what's your position?
this was my father's.
it was handed down from his father.
if you want to fight this way, Sora, I will win.
you will have avenged no one.
we'll see.
engage the shield.
I'm almost finished.
a massive wave is approaching from the west.
without the shield...
we're starting to get hits on the northern pier.
routing power to the corridor... Now.
now.
now.
okay, this is a problem.
what?
look, I told you this was a long shot from the beginning.
we already have serious flooding on the north and west piers.
it's no use. The city conduits can't handle this kind of raw power.
is any power getting to the shield generator?
nominal amounts. Nowhere near enough.
you said this would work.
I don't know if you noticed or not, but I am extremely arrogant man who tends to think all of his plans will work.
idiot!
Hey, this was a long shot at best.
why else would we evacuate the city?
it was always our intention to dial out in case this didn't work.
within minutes, Atlantis will fail.
you can leave and survive, or you can go down with the city.
you choose.
we're just not getting enough power to the shield generators.
are you really going to sacrifice the lives of all of your men on the off-chance that this city won't be completely destroyed?
open the stargate.
start evacuating the remaining men.
you're making the right decision.
you're coming with us.
what?
you'll both serve the Genii as payment for what you've done.
Oh, for what we've done?
change of plan.
you got McKay.
seriously, this is a bad idea.
you saw what happened to my last plan.
this is not what...
you're not going anywhere.
I will shoot you if you don't let her go.
and risk hurting Dr. Weir?
I'm not aiming at her.
find Teyla and Beckett. Make sure that's all of them.
sorry about that. I had to...
you okay?
no.
you will be. Come on.
wait! What are you doing?
I thought I'd activate the shield and save the day.
you got something else in mind?
Teyla and Beckett are still out there.
tracking system's down.
there's a tsunami headed towards the city, Lieutenant.
in two and a half minutes, they're dead.
then we give them two minutes.
this is not what your father would have wanted.
our people were destined to be allies...
Teyla and Beckett, fall back to the control room.
this must end... now!
then end it.
there's no more time.
we either lose them or we lose the city.
Rodney, go!
going!
what's happening?
it's working, It just needs to build up enough power for the shield to activate.
wait for it.
you're just in time to see how this ends, huh?
now.
nice work, Rodney.
did you ever doubt me?
Yes, several times.
I see you've made a new friend, Teyla.
what do you want to do with her?
I don't know yet.
we'll keep her locked up for the time being.
maybe releasing her back to the Genii would help ease tension between us.
you're extremely optimistic. You know that?
you think so?
everyone getting back okay?
looks like it.
how fares our city?
well, we've begun pumping out the lower levels of the east pier, which was flooded.
there is structural damage, nothing too serious.
Beckett's suffered from a minor concussion.
I mean, look at this. I had to do this myself.
still, on the bright side, I've had my first decent meal in 24 hours, so all things considered, I would say we are just fine.
you say these things happen every 20 years, right?
that's what they tell us.
you have some Wraith DNA
my father told people it was a gift
I could help my people by warning them of the Wraith's approach.
no matter how many Wraith ships be destroyed more can come here.
you're saying you think Teyla might be able to...
tap into this Wraith psychic network?
if she can we'll be able to gather all the intel we ever needed about them.
I would not even consider asking you to do this if I didn't think it could potentially provide us with some vital information.
Dr. Beckett will remain on hand at all times to monitor your physiology.
I am on a ship.
you are all so pathetic.
um ... shotgun ... is it?
Oh, come on.
I don't know why I have to do this.
what?
nobody said anything.
you don't have to, do you?
look, it's not my fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.
Rodney, you said you knew where it was.
I said I knew its last known location.
it is a mobile drilling station, remember?
obviously that's gonna take a few hours.
if we don't find it soon, this is gonna be your last known location.
Oh, zing!
OK, kids.
do I have to pull this thing over?
it's hard enough being in this damned thing for hours without listening to you guys.
actually, Doctor McKay has managed to narrow the search field to a remarkably small area.
Finally! The voice of reason!
thank you, Doctor ... um ...
Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.
uh, I've been here almost eight months.
Really?
Oh.
it's been that long, has it?
time certainly flies.
of course, not sitting in a Jumper looking for a needle in a haystack.
you know what? Shut up!
you know what? You shut up, OK?
Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining!
uh, it's Graydon, with a 'd'.
what?
you sure?
it's my name.
no-no-no, 'cause I could have sworn that the guy I wanted from your department was called Grayson, 'cause I remember thinking Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne's ward.
well, it's Graydon.
perhaps that means I hired the wrong guy.
well, still glad you came?
Oh, sorry. I was preoccupied thinking about the geothermal drilling platform.
shouldn't take us much longer.
we just passed the thermal layer and I'm getting some readings a couple of hundred feet ahead.
if we did manage to find an alternate and potentially limitless power supply that would make even this insufferably long search seem worthwhile.
OK, kids, we're here.
well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to power up the station.
that wasn't so hard.
now all I've gotta do is dock this thing and we can find out what this place is all about.
submersion
all systems are online and functioning at full capacity.
you mean we're generating power already?
well ...
no. No-no, but we probably could if we wanted to.
no, slow down.
the Ancients abandoned this project for a reason.
let's try to find out what that reason might be before we start drilling into the planet's crust.
Yes, well, fair enough.
have we not been down this hallway before?
every corridor looks the same.
don't worry. I have an uncanny sense of direction.
I think she's right.
we've been down this way before.
that's impossible.
we took a left, and a left, and then a right.
Hey, look, all I'm saying is ...
what?
I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.
are you sure?
we're pretty deep underwater.
I cannot be certain, but I believe it is onboard the drilling platform.
this is Sheppard.
everyone drop what you're doing; get back to the Control Room immediately.
we did a complete life signs scan.
it's the first thing we did when we stepped aboard this station.
look, I promise you, there is nobody here but us.
I know, Rodney, but I am sensing it even closer now.
well, maybe it's the pressure.
it's been known to do things to the mind.
just humour me and check again.
there.
all of these life signs have been accounted for.
Humoured?
wraith don't show up on life signs detectors if they're hibernating.
I know what I am sensing.
there is no Wraith here! I'm telling you!
has your sense ever been wrong?
never.
and I cannot shake this feeling.
I trust her.
as opposed to irrefutable fact?
your machines don't know everything.
I never said that they did.
there is a way for me to be sure.
if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link ...
that's a little reckless, don't you think?
if there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind for me to link with and therefore no risk.
but if there is a Wraith nearby ... we need to know.
I am ready.
you sure?
the briefest contact will determine whether or not I'm right.
that's all we need, so don't stick around any longer.
and we will bring you out of it at the first sign of trouble.
just to be sure ...
it's already set to stun.
sorry.
I was mistaken.
there's nothing there.
well, that's good.
I'm sorry.
no reason to be sorry.
perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this depth.
well, if you've ever seen "The Abyss," pressure can make you nuts.
not that I think you're nuts.
it's alright, John.
I am relieved.
so am I.
well, we have a lot of exploring to do.
we?
until Rodney delivers the preliminary status report,
I'm all yours. Put me to work, Colonel.
alright, let's make up some time. Break into teams.
Ronon, you're with Teyla. Elizabeth, you're with me
or I'm with you, however you wanna put it.
either [ee-ther] way ...
or either [eye-ther] way.
that was weird.
well, we are at the very bottom of the ocean.
maybe you're right.
Teyla's just experiencing the effects of the pressure.
hopefully not as bad as that guy in "The Abyss.
this place is big, huh?
what's wrong?
nothing. Why?
you just haven't said a word.
have I not?
no.
has my silence made you uncomfortable?
no.
your friendship is very important to me.
I would hate to do anything that made you ... uncomfortable.
well... good
what's going on?
what do you mean, what's going on?
we just lost the lights.
what?
you're right.
Yes, we can see that!
we just lost power to forty percent of the station.
sensors are currently offline.
Zelenka, what are you doing?
uh, what do you mean, what am I doing?
have you lost power where you are?
no.
have you?
no.
we have.
I wanna know what's going on.
you know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia.
we're bound to blow a few fuses.
look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.
report your position.
Ronon, Teyla? Come in.
Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon and Teyla.
you know their position?
no, negative.
internal sensors are out, but I have determined the location where the power went down.
it's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.
it's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.
we'll meet you there.
it's, uh, Dickenson, sir.
Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here.
look, get back to the Jumper
see if you can use its sensors to determine the location of our people within the drilling platform.
sir.
Graydon, you go with him.
there you are.
weapons fire.
nine mil. This way.
Oh, yes. Let's race towards the gunfire!
Ronon, Teyla, come in.
are you alright?
No!
did you see who attacked you?
Yeah, it was Teyla.
What?! Why?
OK, until we know what's going on,
I'd like everyone in one place.
this is Zelenka.
someone has just activated emergency forcefields throughout the station.
can you make it back to the Control Room?
Yes, I think so.
do it.
that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?
you and Elizabeth go back to the Control Room.
ronon and I are gonna check up on Teyla.
be careful.
no kidding!
drop it.
what the hell's going on?
I do not know.
Rodney, what's the status?
as far from the "quo" as it gets.
look, Teyla didn't just shut down several key systems;
she scrambled the existing operating codes.
this is going to take a while.
can we contact Atlantis?
the station's communication system is just gone.
I can't even patch it. She's blown the control crystals
and shut down half the power to the station and set up a series of emergency forcefields.
to what purpose?
this is Sheppard.
we've got Teyla.
And?
and nothin'.
she has no memory of anything that happened the last hour.
we're on our way to Crew Quarters.
I'll meet you there.
OK, let's forget about restoring the station to its former glory.
concentrate your efforts on internal sensors and disabling the forcefields that are cutting us off from the Jumper.
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.
don't worry about that.
how are you feeling now?
I'm fine but to hear of the damage I caused and yet to have no memory of my actions ...
just tell us what you do remember.
I was attempting to seek out the Wraith presence with my mind and then ...
there is a Wraith?
the most powerful mind I have ever encountered.
I tried to shut her out ...
her?
Yes.
I believe this Wraith is a Queen.
I hate Queens.
in that brief moment, I sensed great power the experiences of many centuries hunger ...
and then nothing
my next memory is of Colonel Sheppard and Ronon aiming their weapons towards me.
so there is a Wraith aboard the drilling platform.
if that were the case why'd she use Teyla to do all that damage and why didn't the life signs detector pick up a signal?
doesn't matter.
if she's here - I'll find her. - We'll find her.
I would like to help.
I'm sorry, Teyla, - but until we can determine exactly what ... - Yes, of course.
I understand.
any progress on disabling those forcefields?
I'm getting indications that some of them are going up and down.
we could really use the Jumper's sensors.
I'm doing my best, sir.
one of these days I'm just going to call him Doctor McCoy.
I'd love to be there for that!
well, the next time he calls me Grayson ...
actually, I know a Grayson.
there really is a Grayson?
Yeah. He's a damned good scientist, too.
I'm surprised McKay didn't hire him.
did you do that?
I don't know but I'm happy to take credit for it.
check it out.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
what could the Wraith possibly want with an Ancient drilling platform?
for that matter, how did they even get here?
maybe on a ship nearby.
underwater?
who knows?
Teyla's spidey-sense works for miles.
look, are the external sensors up and running?
uh, yes, they're operational, but they're designed to scan the ocean floor.
doesn't matter.
take a look at the drilling platform's external sensors see what you turn up.
what am I looking for?
anything.
how are you feeling?
I have never been more ashamed.
Oh, you can't blame yourself.
I should have been more careful.
a Wraith Queen's mind is extremely powerful, Teyla.
you know that better than I do. - Still if my actions while under her control result in people getting hurt ...
if you hadn't done what you did, who knows what could have happened?
at least now we know what we're dealing with.
if anything, I should thank you.
I certainly don't blame you.
I would like to help them find her.
there is no risk.
I don't know that.
unless you suspect I am still under her control even now.
would I be alone with you if I did?
then you think I am somehow vulnerable to her.
I think it is best to keep you away from her for the moment, yes.
look, I don't fully understand this capability you have of linking with a Wraith mind but if it's even remotely possible that ...
she was only able to control me because I opened my mind to her.
if I choose to do so again,
I will be ready.
Teyla, I know you wanna help.
I do.
the best way for you to do that is allow Ronon and Colonel Sheppard to find her.
as you wish.
it's about time.
I was beginning to think you'd gotten lost.
listen, did you manage to, uh ...
Colonel Sheppard!
if you can hear me, please ...
help me!
who am I talking to?
what's your location?
do you have any men unaccounted for?
two guys I just sent back to the Jumper.
I think they're in trouble. Can you get those forcefields down?
we're working on it.
the Wraith presence is even stronger than before.
she is aboard this station. You must warn them.
Colonel Sheppard
Teyla's certain the Wraith is aboard the station.
understood.
Ronon, I'm headin' back to the Jumper. Meet me there.
I'm on my way.
help me! Please!
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Almost there.
I can only do one at a time.
the Jumper's sensors should be able to locate them.
Graydon's dead.
fed upon.
what about Dickenson?
no sign of him yet.
let's see if we can find him using the, uh ...
Sheppard, come in.
you are Sheppard.
the one who can fly this ship.
you will return me to the surface.
kneel.
Sheppard, this is McKay. What've you got?
Sheppard, can you hear me?
is something wrong?
you will fly me to the Stargate and return me to my people.
Sheppard, this is McKay. Please respond.
Sheppard, come in!
I'm here.
we had to throw the emergency forcefields up.
the section you were in was flooding.
I noticed!
see, you were thrown by the force of the water clear of the forcefield bulkhead.
I missed.
I noticed that too!
everyone else is accounted for.
any sign of Dickenson?
stand by, McKay.
look, I don't know what just happened, but we are now cut off from the Jumper.
I won't miss now.
wait!
what for?
well, we lost the Jumper, we lost communications with Atlantis.
maybe she can help us get out of this place.
welcome back.
I trust you're comfortable.
that groggy sensation you're feeling are the sedatives we're pumping you full of.
just a precaution.
as for the other precautions ...
now, you're gonna tell us everything we want to know.
in exchange for ...?
this is not a negotiation.
I disagree.
let me get this over with.
how did you get aboard this station?
are there any more of you?
you are all about to die.
Really?
you care to elaborate on that at all?
we should be able to keep the forcefields up until Atlantis sends a rescue Jumper but station communications are still down, so ...
I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.
don't worry about it, Rodney. It's not your fault.
I'm the one who sent those men back to the Jumper.
well, the sensors indicated that there was nobody here, so ...
I don't think there was, sir.
I think the Wraith arrived here after we did the initial scans.
what?
you asked me to do a search with the remote sensors. I found something.
we didn't notice it on the way down because it's radiating very little E. M.
guys? Head back here.
I think I have a few answers.
a Wraith cruiser.
it's almost completely buried in silt.
which means it's been here a very, very, very long time.
Yes, give or take a very.
that doesn't explain how she got here.
maybe she swam over.
no, no.
the pressure at that depth is ... is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?
Yes, it's difficult to imagine, but with the Wraith's ability to heal itself ...
and there are no other Wraith on board?
no way to know for sure.
our prisoner isn't talking, other than "You're all about to die.
which may or may not be an empty threat.
then you have no way of knowing?
well, she said it with a lot of confidence.
there is a way to find out.
we've already been down that road.
and what is to stop her exerting control over you again?
she's heavily sedated.
and this time I know exactly what I'm dealing with.
you.
I was caught offguard the first time.
that will not happen again.
it does not matter.
well, we think it does.
your fate is sealed.
if you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.
I won't.
I see her ... leading the first wave of ships that attacked Atlantis during the war.
queen of a great alliance.
her ship was damaged during the battle.
it crashed into the ocean.
she fed upon her own crew to survive.
too deep to ever swim to the surface ... waking between centuries ...
waiting for rescue that never came ...
until finally she was alone.
she sensed our presence during our descent.
she sensed ...me and saw us as her one chance of freedom from her prison.
the water was ... crushing but she was determined
finally after all these millennia a ship!
but she did not possess the gene to fly it.
she used Dickenson to call for me.
you are all about to die.
that does not sound like Teyla.
you are all about to die.
you are all about to die.
Teyla, snap out of it!
wait!
she has activated the self-destruct device of the Wraith cruiser.
it is set to detonate within two hours.
so not an empty threat.
how's Teyla?
she's resting.
I think it took a lot more out of her than she's willing to admit.
what's the news?
OK, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this section of the ocean floor because the planet's crust is remarkably thin right below us, allowing them to drill directly into the magma and maximise the geothermal power output.
which means there's a great deal of potential energy directly beneath this station.
that's the news? That this place works as advertised?
no. No the news is that if they were to detonate, say, the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just such a wafer-thin crust ...
Oh my God.
all that thermal energy directly beneath us will be released all at once.
so, bad news.
Yeah. The initial explosion will be magnified a thousand times. We're talking catastrophic.
so it won't just be us that's affected.
no. Atlantis will be affected as well.
it's well within the blast radius.
and we have no way to warn them?
they'd never even see it coming.
so we disarm the self-destruct.
that's brilliant, but we still need to get there.
and how do we do that without the Jumper?
we're way behind schedule.
they're gonna send a rescue Jumper any minute now.
even if they've left already - I mean the moment we were overdue ...
no, they won't make it in time.
how far is the cruiser?
um less than a kilometre.
she swam that far?!
what is she?!
a formidable enemy.
I have an idea.
I found these in the database when we first got here.
they were used primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.
very cool!
Yeah. You should be able to traverse the distance between here and the cruiser.
you mean we.
Yes, of course. We.
this must be how she got in.
probably
alright. Let's get suited up.
right.
you're breathing too hard.
forgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.
just think of it as a walk on the beach a beach that's about to explode.
that's supposed to make me feel better?!
no, it's supposed to make you walk faster.
we're on the clock here.
this is Weir. How close are you?
almost there but we're runnin' out of time
we may need Teyla to do her Kreskin act again.
I'd rather not have to.
I think it could be much too dangerous for her.
so is exploding magma.
I am walking as fast as I can.
how do we disarm the self-destruct?
you won't survive the blast any more than we will.
I can get the information we need.
if you are strong enough you would have done so already.
I can feel how weak you are.
we shall see who is stronger.
Hey, that took too long.
Yeah, well
I probably won't be able to disarm the self- destruct in time anyway so we're really not in a rush.
why don't we find it first, and then you can be negative?
the ship is remarkably preserved.
you'd think after ten thousand years, she'd want to redecorate.
I'm serious.
the hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their main drive.
you're saying this thing is salvageable?
hmm, I'd have to assess damage to primary systems but it's not completely out of the question.
of course, you'd probably just go and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all that work'd be for nothing.
tick, tick, tick.
this way.
you are weakening.
Teyla, I think you should stop.
my concentration slipped for just a moment.
and in that moment, I could have crushed you with a single thought.
perhaps next time, I will.
there isn't gonna be a next time.
Elizabeth, I am fine.
no, you're not.
I can see what this is doing to you.
let's just give McKay a chance.
there it is.
what?
I'm pretty sure this is the device and I'm pretty sure it says we have less than half an hour.
so turn it off.
what does that mean?
it's not accepting commands of any kind.
there must be some kind of a command code that needs to be entered first.
can you figure it out?
Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple like the number one or the letter A like, in Wraith, which would be, umm ...
can you figure out the code or not?
No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years and we have ...
just under a million years less than that
Elizabeth, you there?
any luck?
negative
if we don't get the command code in less than thirty minutes we're dead.
this is the only way.
I told you, Rodney has another idea.
that may or may not succeed.
there is only one way to be certain.
she said she would kill you next time.
I will not let that happen.
no.
we're gonna give them more time.
there's been an emergency in the Control Room. Doctor Weir needs your help.
what about her?
I'll watch the prisoner.
hurry.
watch yourself.
are you fool enough to try again?
I have very little to lose.
you're trying to hide something from me.
there's been a development.
were you able to disarm the self-destruct device?
no but Rodney thinks if we can tie in a naqahdah generator he can still get the Wraith cruiser to fly.
after all these years?
Yeah. The damage is superficial.
the problem was the engines.
McKay's already restored power and I think
I can fly the ship to a safe distance.
that's a suicide mission.
well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland maybe I can get far enough away from the explosion
I gotta go now.
wait
let me try again.
if I can get her to give up her command code you won't have to risk it.
you're in no condition to do that.
sorry.
you're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you that.
you have restored power?
it'll fly.
you shall be rewarded ... with a quick death.
she's not dying according to plan here!
I thought you'd forgotten about me!
of course not! I just had to wait for her to disable the device.
hey just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the command code.
Oh, that's why you didn't wanna be bait!
no-no-no-no. You had to be bait because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.
she is dead, right?
let's get outta here.
How're you feelin'?
much better now that I no longer feel the constant presence of a Wraith.
that was no ordinary Wraith.
it took a lot of bullets to take her down.
I wish I was there.
he's right, you know.
I mean, deceiving a Wraith Queen that's no small feat.
well, when there are so many lives at stake, it's easy to summon the strength.
well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up.
turns out Atlantis had sent another Jumper.
should be here within the hour.
that's good news!
Yeah, no kiddin'. I can't wait to see the sun.
what? No-no-no - we haven't finished what we came here for.
look, the Wraith's gone - we've got a ton of research to do.
Yes, we do.
in fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.
is he serious?
Yeah. He is.
well, I for one intend to spend the next little while resting.
same here.
yeah
same here.
=www. ydy. E613com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
I'm JUST SAYING, AS A TEAM VETERAN,
to THE NEW GUY
heavy LUNCH BEFORE MISSION DEPARTURE,
bad IDEA.
I MEAN, EVEN WITH THE INERTIAL DAMPENERS,
this WHOLE FLYING THING IS BEST DONE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.
Yeah, WELL, I'VE GOT A PRETTY STRONG STOMACH.
HEY,I CAN EAT FROZEN DINNERS WITHOUT THAWING THEM,
and SOMETIMES IT EVEN AFFECTS ME.
McKay, ARE YOU READING ANYTHING?
Oh.
nothing.
life SIGNS FROM THE PLANET ARE NEGATIVE.
it IS A SHAME. FROM WHAT WE READ IN THE ATLANTIS DATABASE,
the DORANDANS WERE A WONDERFUL RACE OF PEOPLE.
well, THE DATABASE IS OVER 10, 000 YEARS OLD.
you CAN BET THINGS HAVE CHANGED AROUND HERE.
okay.
that's NOT SOMETHING YOU SEE EVERY DAY.
there WAS A GREAT BATTLE HERE.
that IS A HIVE SHIP.
that WAS A HIVE SHIP.
something PUT A LOT OF HOLES IN IT,
all RIGHT.
we SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
whoa, WHOA, WHOA.
what IF WHATEVER PUT HOLES IN IT WANTS TO PUT HOLES IN US?
like YOU SAID, A LOT'S CHANGED IN 10, 000 YEARS.
that WOULD EXPLAIN THE LACK OF LIFE SIGNS.
this IS WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIGHT BACK.
these FOLKS TOOK OUT A FLEET OF WRAITH SHIPS.
I'd SAY THEY DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB FIGHTING BACK.
hold ON.
I'm PICKING UP FAINT ENERGY READINGS,
coming FROM...THERE.
WELL,THAT EXPLAINS HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT UP SUCH A GOOD FIGHT.
how?
BECAUSE...THEY WERE ANCIENTS.
definitely ANCIENT DESIGN.
their LATEST STUFF, TOO
their LATEST BEING 10, 000 YEARS OLD.
it LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE LABS
we've FOUND ON ATLANTIS.
so THIS WAS ONE OF THEIR OUTPOSTS?
yet THE ANCESTORS MADE NO MENTION OF THEIR PRESENCE HERE IN THEIR DATABASE.
Why?
well, LET'S FIND OUT.
can YOU POWER IT UP?
working ON IT.
I've GOT TWO BODIES HERE.
I've GOT THREE MORE OVER HERE.
whatever HAPPENED HERE,
no ONE CAME BACK TO CLAIM THE DEAD.
can't TELL IF THEY WERE FED ON BY THE WRAITH.
Yeah, SOMETHING KILLED THEM.
something KILLED EVERYONE ON THIS WORLD.
then WHY IS THIS OUTPOST,
if THAT'S WHAT IT IS, STILL INTACT?
it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
what DO YOU THINK, RODNEY?
Hah.
sorry, I WASN'T LISTENING,
but IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT THIS IS AN ANCIENT OUTPOST.
why WOULD THE WRAITH LEAVE IT INTACT?
that's A GOOD QUESTION.
huh.
all RIGHT. SO...
so IT'S A MILITARY RESEARCH FACILITY?
from WHAT WE CAN TELL,
it's A GROUND-BASED VERSION OF THE SATELLITE WEAPON
we USED TO DESTROY THAT HIVE SHIP.
with ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION-- FIREPOWER.
I MEAN,IF THAT SINGLE OUTPOST IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DESTROYING AN ENTIRE WRAITH FLEET
and YOU'RE SURE IT WAS THIS WEAPON THAT DESTROYED ALL THOSE WRAITH SHIPS?
it HAD TO BE.
there's NOTHING ON THE PLANET
that SUGGESTS THE DORANDANS HAD ANYTHING CAPABLE OF INFLICTING
anywhere NEAR THAT MUCH DAMAGE.
if WE COULD LEARN OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY,
we COULD DEFEND OTHER WORLDS FROM BEING CULLED.
it DIDN'T SAVE THE DORANDANS.
Yeah, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE OUTPOST WAS STILL STANDING,
and THAT MEANS, UH... I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS,
but IT MEANS SOMETHING DEFINITELY WORTH FINDING OUT.
Colonel?
he's RIGHT.
it's DEFINITELY WORTH SENDING A RESEARCH TEAM BACK.
well, GIVE ME OPTICAN AND COLLINS,
and ZELENKA, IF HE'S OVER THE STOMACH FLU.
we'll TRY TO ACCESS THE COMPUTER'S LOGBOOKS, SEE IF WE CAN DECIPHER THEM
okay. OKAY.
easy SELL. GO.
Oh. GOOD.
Teyla. UM...
I HEARD YOU WERE HEADING OFF-WORLD ON A PERSONAL MISSION.
to BELKAN, YES.
sounds INTERESTING.
the BELKANS POSSESS A PARTICULAR DISEASE-RESISTANT STRAIN OF FLAX SEED,
which WOULD DOUBLE THE YIELD OF OUR CROPS ON THE MAINLAND.
in EXCHANGE,
I INTEND TO OFFER ATHOSIAN MANPOWER
to AID IN THEIR HARVEST.
still INTERESTED?
UH,THIS PLACE...HAS EVERYTHING I COULD WANT,
don't GET ME WRONG, BUT, UH
sometimes YOU FEEL THE NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
anywhere ELSE.
I KNOW THE FEELING.
so?
bring ONLY WEAPONS YOU CAN CONCEAL.
I'll KEEP IT TO A BARE MINIMUM.
I'm TELLING YOU,
at LEAST . 09%.
Oh, PLEASE.
please, MOVE THE DECIMAL PLACE.
I MEAN, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
have WE FIGURED OUT WHAT THIS IS?
no.
I WOULDN'T SAY NO. NO, WE HAVE A THEORY.
but WE DON'T KNOW YET.
no, BUT BASED ON THE SHIELDING AROUND THE CHAMBER,
what ELSE COULD IT BE?
have YOU TRIED TURNING IT ON?
that's WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
the PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S NO DIRECT LINK BETWEEN IT AND THE MAIN POWER CONTROL SYSTEMS,
which, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
led US TO THEORIZE
it's AN ANCILLARY POWER SUPPLY FOR THE WEAPON SYSTEMS.
cool.
see THAT? SEE?
see THE WAY HE LIGHTS UP AT THE MENTION OF THAT?
it's LIKE DR. VOGEL AT THE MENTION OF PASTRY.
they FOUND OUT A WAY TO SOUP UP THEIR SPACE GUNS?
Yes, BUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
the STICKING POINT IS
that THERE'S NO TIE BETWEEN THE POWER GENERATOR AND THE PRIMARY CAPACITOR.
YEAH,MEANING THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHANNEL THE POWER DIRECTLY INTO THE WEAPON.
which, I'M SURE, MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.
it MEANS THEY COULD FIRE MULTIPLE BURSTS
without HAVING TO STORE UP MORE POWER FOR THE NEXT FIRING SEQUENCE.
Yes.
very GOOD.
which LEADS ME BACK TO "COOL.
Mm.
Yes, BUT IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IF WE'RE RIGHT.
about WHAT?
tell HIM.
not YET.
come ON, McKAY.
you READ THE EQUATIONS.
what ELSE COULD IT BE? AN ANCIENT TYPO?
well, WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT PERFECT
because THEY'RE ALL DEAD.
LOOK,I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO GET ALL EXCITED OVER NOTHING.
well, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'll GIVE YOU A HINT.
it SEEMS THE ANCIENTS WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH HIGH-ENERGY PHYSICS
on A LEVEL THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
Wow.
YES,"WOW." I JUST... I WANT TO BE SURE.
I'll DO MY BEST TO WAIT.
the MANPOWER THAT YOU ARE DEMANDING IS OUTRAGEOUS.
you WOULD TURN MY PEOPLE INTO NOTHING MORE THAN INDENTURED SLAVES
to SERVE YOUR FARMS.
it WOULD SEEM THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE OF VALUE TO TRADE
but YOUR PEOPLE.
you KNOW FULL WELL MY OFFER IS FAIR.
I'm SORRY, TEYLA.
if YOU HAD SOMETHING OF MORE VALUE TO OFFER TECHNOLOGY, WEAPONS...
you've HEARD MY TERMS.
hmm.
then OUR BUSINESS IS DONE HERE.
she SAID HER OFFER IS FAIR.
I SAY IT ISN'T.
well, I SAY IT IS.
what?
I HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.
it DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT.
so YOU CAME TO MY RESCUE?
you HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS AT STAKE DURING THESE NEGOTIATIONS.
my PEOPLE DEPEND ON ME.
they WERE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.
no, THEY WERE NOT,
but THAT IS WHAT I WANTED THEM TO THINK.
a NEGOTIATION IS A DELICATE PROCESS.
the WORDS SPOKEN ARE OFTEN MEANINGLESS.
do YOU WANT ME TO
no.
go. GATHER OUR THINGS.
I WILL MEET YOU AT THE GATE.
it WAS A MISTAKE TO FORCE HENDON'S HAND.
you'll ONLY PAY FOR IT NEXT TIME.
I KNOW.
your FRIEND IS NOT ATHOSIAN?
no.
ronon IS THE ONLY SURVIVOR OF A WORLD NAMED SATEDA.
he SAVED THE LIFE OF A FRIEND OF MINE.
in RETURN, WE OFFERED HIM SANCTUARY.
if SATEDA IS HIS HOMEWORLD,
then HE IS NOT THE ONLY SURVIVOR.
there IS A MAN IN THIS VILLAGE
who ALSO CLAIMS TO BE FROM THERE.
what HAVE WE GOT, SERGEANT?
it's COLONEL SHEPPARD, MA'AM.
this IS WEIR. GO AHEAD, COLONEL.
we're ON OUR WAY BACK.
Rodney WANTS TO FILL YOU IN.
I TAKE IT YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING.
interesting?
how ABOUT THE GREATEST DISCOVERY OF ALL TIME?
he's PRETTY EXCITED.
so I HEAR.
he COULDN'T EVEN WAIT UNTIL HE GOT BACK.
I WANTED TO SEND AN ENCODED DATABURST DIRECTLY FROM THE OUTPOST TO THE SECURE NETWORK IN MY LAB
while THE GATE WAS ACTIVE.
now.
receiving TRANSMISSION.
transferring DATA.
care TO FILL ME IN SO I CAN BE EXCITED TOO?
it's A WEAPON
it IS MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN A WEAPON.
we THINK WE'VE STUMBLED ACROSS THE ANCIENTS' LAST GREAT DISCOVERY.
it WAS TOO LATE TO WIN THE WAR FOR THEM,
but IF I CAN FINISH THE WORK THEY STARTED
what IS IT?
it IS THE ULTIMATE POWER SOURCE.
something THAT WOULD MAKE ZERO-POINT MODULES LIKE ALCALINE BATTERY
ar IT WAS CALLED PROJECT ARCTURUS,
and FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL, ITS ULTIMATE GOAL WAS TO RENDER ZPMs OBSOLETE.
how?
a ZERO-POINT MODULE IS AN ARTIFICIALLY CREATED REGION OF SUBSPACE-TIME.
it's KIND OF LIKE A MINIATURE UNIVERSE IN A BOTTLE.
it EXTRACTS VACUUM ENERGY FROM THIS ARTIFICIAL REGION OF SUBSPACE-TIME
until IT REACHES MAXIMUM ENTROPY.
so WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS THING?
project ARCTURUS WAS ATTEMPTING TO EXTRACT VACUUM ENERGY FROM OUR OWN SPACE-TIME,
making IT POTENTIALLY AS POWERFUL AS THE SCOPE OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF.
this STRIKES ME AS SOMETHING
the ANCIENTS WOULD'VE TRIED FIRST,
even BEFORE ZPMs.
and THEY MAY HAVE,
but EXTRACTING ZERO-POINT ENERGY FROM OUR OWN UNIVERSE IS...
well, IT'S DEFINITELY TRICKIER.
explain "TRICKIER.
WELL,BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO LIVE IN OUR OWN UNIVERSE,
it PRESENTS A WHOLE RANGE OF PROBLEMS.
well, OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT THAT EASY,
or ATLANTIS WOULDN'T STILL RELY ON ZPMs.
well, YOU'RE RIGHT.
the ANCIENTS COULDN'T MAKE IT WORK.
I SAID I WANTED TO DO ALL THE TALKING.
come ON, RODNEY. ARCTURUS WAS A TOTAL FAILURE.
failure, YES. TOTAL, NO.
Look,The ANCIENTS WERE LOSING THE WAR AGAINST THE WRAITH
when WORK ON ARCTURUS BEGAN.
if THEY COULD HAVE MADE IT WORK,
it COULD HAVE TURNED THE TIDE OF WAR.
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR OWN MANHATTAN PROJECT.
the OUTPOST WAS ORDEREDBY THE ANCIENTS IN ATLANTIS
to DEFEND THE DORANDAN PEOPLE
using THEIR WEAPONS POWERED BY THIS NEW POWER SOURCE.
Yeah, YES, BUT DESPITE THEIR STRONG RESERVATIONS
that IT WAS NOT READY TO BE TESTED UNDER BATTLE CONDITIONS.
well, THE POINT IS, THE WRAITH WON.
Yeah, BUT THE DORANDANS STILL INFLICTED MASSIVE DAMAGE ON THE ATTACKING WRAITH FLEET.
I'm NOT SAYING THEY DIDN'T PUT UP A HELL OF A FIGHT.
the LOGS INDICATE
there WAS A MAJOR MALFUNCTION.
the ANCIENTS IN THE BUNKER WERE FORCED TO SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN, INCLUDING THE WEAPON.
the WRAITH SENT MORE SHIPS, THE DORANDANS GOT WIPED OUT.
so IF THE MALFUNCTION HADN'T OCCURRED,
the ANCIENTS WOULD'VE SAVED THE PLANET? DEFINITELY.
possibly. DON'T SUGARCOAT THIS, RODNEY.
the ANCIENT SCIENTISTS RUNNING ARCTURUS WERE RUSHED INTO TESTING
before THEY HAD PERFECTED A MEANS OF EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLING THE POWER OUTPUT.
I BELIEVE IF THEY'D HAD MORE TIME,
history WOULD'VE PLAYED OUT DIFFERENTLY ON THAT PLANET.
possibly IN THIS GALAXY.
I WON'T DENY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
that WE'D DEARLY LOVE TO GET OUR HANDS ON,
but THE ANCIENTS WERE A PRETTY BRIGHT BUNCH.
and DESPERATE,
and LOSING A WAR THEY'D ALREADY BEEN FIGHTING FOR A HUNDRED YEARS.
more IMPORTANTLY, THEY WERE...
they WERE, LIKE, THIS CLOSE.
and YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN FINISH THEIR WORK?
I DO.
we DO.
they DO.
all RIGHT, I NEED EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, PLEASE.
what WE'VE GOT HERE...
I NEED THIS CODE DIVIDED UP INTO SECTIONS
and EACH ONE DOUBLE-CHECKED...
no, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!
it's NOT GOING TO-- I'M TELLING YOU
this ONE RIGHT HERE IS WRONG.
the WHOLE POINT HERE IS THAT THESE NUMBERS HERE NEED TO BE CORRECTED.
unless THEY'RE CORRECTED
there YOU GO. SIMULATION FAILED.
that's HEAVY.
so, I NEED THAT OVER THERE.
thank YOU.
I WANT YOU TO PULL THE CRYSTAL.
pull IT WHEN I SAY GO, ALL RIGHT?
I THINK WE HAVE IT.
that's IT!
we ARE LOOKING FOR A MAN NAMED SOLEN.
do YOU KNOW HIM?
upstairs.
thank YOU.
was I AFRAID?
of COURSE I WAS,
but MY PEOPLE WERE COUNTING ON ME.
now I WAS ALONE, AND I WAS LOW ON AMMO,
but I MANAGED TO TAKE OUT THE THREE WRAITH GUARDS
and GAIN ACCESS TO THE SHIP.
liar.
what DID YOU SAY?
there WERE TWO WRAITH GUARDING THAT CRUISER,
and HE WASN'T ALONE.
we SERVED IN THE SAME REGIMENT ON SATEDA.
I AM HONORED.
you TWO MAKE A NICE MATCH.
Congratulations.
we ARE FRIENDS, NOTHING MORE.
for YEARS,
I BELIEVED I WAS THE ONLY SURVIVOR.
so YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHERS?
what OTHERS?
before THE CITY FELL,
a FEW OF US MANAGED TO MAKE IT TO THE SHELTERS WEST OF THE CAPITAL.
over 300 CIVILIANS
found THEIR WAY THERE, TOO.
when WE EMERGED,
we REALIZED THERE WAS NOTHING TO SALVAGE,
so WE LEFT.
all OF US.
to WHERE?
some CAME HERE,
some WENT TO MANARIA.
drink, RONON,
and REJOICE-- YOU'RE NOT ALONE!
Yeah!
everything's BEEN TRIPLE-CHECKED.
power LEVELS ARE HOLDING STEADY IN ALL COMPUTER SIMULATIONS.
fire IT UP.
all RIGHT.
attention, ALL PERSONNEL.
stand BY FOR POWER-UP
on MY MARK.
mark.
Oh, MAN.
to SEE KELL'S FACE WHEN HE SEES YOU...
Yeah, IT'S TRUE.
KELL'S ALIVE?
and HIS FAMILY.
they SETTLED ON BELSA.
run THIS BIG TRADING OPERATION OVER THERE.
when WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME THIS?
honestly?
I WAS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL YOU DRANK A LITTLE MORE.
then YOU'VE SEEN HIM?
Yeah, HE COMES AROUND NOW AND THEN
to TRADE WEAPONS WITH THE BELKANS.
he's GOT HIS OWN PRIVATE ARMY NOW.
is THIS KELL A FRIEND?
Oh, HE'S MORE LIKE KIN.
he WAS RONON'S TASK MASTER DURING HIS MILITARY TRAINING.
there IS NO CLOSER BOND.
none.
to REUNIONS.
to REUNIONS.
Radek, TALK TO ME.
I'm PICKING UP SOME MINOR POWER FLUCTUATIONS.
chamber TEMPERATURE'S HOLDING STEADY.
there IT GOES AGAIN.
is EVERYTHING OKAY?
everything's FINE.
the CONTAINMENT BOTTLE WAS DESIGNED TO AUTOMATICALLY COMPENSATE
for ANY SUDDEN CHANGES IN ENERGY OUTPUT.
this NEVER HAPPENED IN THE SIMULATIONS.
maybe WE SHOULD ABORT.
I SAID IT'S FINE. COLLINS.
see IF YOU CAN BOOST MORE POWER TO THE FIELD MANUALLY.
you GOT IT.
okay.
prepare FOR TEST FIRING, ON MY MARK.
levels JUST SPIKED INTO THE RED!
what?
shut IT DOWN! SHUT IT ALL DOWN!
I'm TRYING.
the INTERFACE IS NOT RESPONDING.
all RIGHT, I'VE ALREADY SWITCHED TO BACK-UPS.
the LEVELS ARE GOING OFF THE SCALE! McKAY!
I HAVE GIVEN THE COMMAND TO SHUT DOWN.
something's CREATING AN OVERLOAD.
then WE SHOULD EVACUATE.
just GIVE ME A FEW MORE SECONDS.
we MAY NOT HAVE THAT TIME.
wait. WAIT.
it's STABILIZING.
the GENERATOR IS OFFLINE.
what THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
obviously THERE WAS A SURGE OF SOME KIND...
look, COLLINS...
officially, MY REPORT WILL INDICATE
Dr. COLLINS DIED DUE TO RADIATION EXPOSURE,
causing SEVERE BURNS TO WELL OVER 90% OF HIS BODY.
but IT WAS MORE THAN THAT?
aye, MUCH MORE.
to BE HONEST, I HAVE NO IDEA
what SORT OF RADIATION IT WAS.
I've NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF CELLULAR DECAY THIS MASSIVE,
not WHEN EXPOSURE ONLY LASTED MERE SECONDS.
Collins' NEXT OF KIN HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.
good.
what WENT WRONG?
we're STILL ANALYZING DATA FROM THE TEST.
all WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN
is THERE WAS A MASSIVE POWER SURGE,
which IN TURN CAUSED THE CONTAINMENT FIELD TO EXPAND ASYMMETRICALLY
in THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMAND ACCESS TUBE.
as TO WHY...
how ABOUT HUMAN ERROR?
excuse ME?
well, ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORT,
during THE TEST,
Dr. COLLINS MADE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE CONTAINMENT FIELD.
isn't IT POSSIBLE THAT HE TRIGGERED THE SURGE HIMSELF?
are YOU LOOKING FOR A SCAPEGOAT, COLONEL?
not AT ALL, DOCTOR.
I'm ADMITTEDLY LOOKING FOR A RATIONALE
that WOULD ALLOW DR. McKAY TO CONTINUE HIS VERY IMPORTANT WORK.
is THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT?
no.
Collins KNEW THE SYSTEM JUST AS WELL AS ANY OF US.
he WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THAT KIND OF MISTAKE.
everything WAS GOING WELL,
and EVERYONE DID THEIR JOB.
then WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
in TERMS OF PHYSICS, IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
we're STILL ANALYZING THE DATA FROM THE ACCIDENT.
it's GOING TO TAKE TIME
what I DO KNOW IS THE DEVICE DID WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.
no, RODNEY, IT DIDN'T.
well, APART FROM THE OBVIOUS CONTAINMENT ISSUES
it OVERLOADED, AND YOU COULDN'T STOP IT.
but WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE UNTIL WE GO BACK DOWN THERE AND TRY AGAIN.
try AGAIN? ARE YOU SERIOUS?
Yes.
a MEMBER OF YOUR TEAM IS IN THE MORGUE.
and I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DEATH.
Yes, I AM PAINFULLY AWARE OF THAT.
I SENT HIM IN THERE,
and I WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
but WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AND LEARN FROM IT.
we DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG.
which IS WHY WE HAVE TO GO BACK THERE.
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO YOU, RODNEY,
but WE KNEW WHEN WE CAME TO ATLANTIS
that WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES WHICH, FOR THE MOMENT, ARE OUT OF OUR REACH.
it's NOT, IN THIS CASE.
you HAVE THE DATA FROM YOUR FIRST ATTEMPT.
you CAN RUN ALL THE SIMULATIONS YOU WANT.
come ON, ELIZABETH, YOU REALLY THINK
the MILITARY'S GOING TO LET THIS GO?
at THE VERY LEAST, WE SHOULD BE THE FIRST ONES IN THERE TO SPEARHEAD
that's WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
you WANT TO BEAT THEM TO IT?
I'm SORRY.
the ANSWER'S NO.
I'm NOT TIRED.
why DID WE LEAVE?
I BELIEVE YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH.
I BELIEVE I HAVE.
good NIGHT.
there ARE 300 OF MY PEOPLE.
who?
he WAS A SCIENTIST,
worked ON THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AT LOS ALAMOS.
he WAS ONLY 26 YEARS OLD.
accidentally IRRADIATED HIMSELF
while PERFORMING A CRITICAL MASS EXPERIMENT WITH TWO HALF-SPHERES OF PLUTONIUM.
it TOOK HIM A MONTH TO DIE,
and WHILE HIS BODY WAS SLOWLY SHUTTING DOWN FROM RADIATION POISONING,
you KNOW WHAT HE DID WITH HIS LAST 30 DAYS?
hmm?
he WORKED.
he TRIED UNTIL HIS LAST BREATH
to UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
so THAT OTHERS COULD LEARN FROM THE TRAGEDY,
so THAT HIS WORK, HIS DEATH
wouldn't BE RENDERED MEANINGLESS.
NOW,HAVE YOU CONSIDERED WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF THEY'D JUST SHUT THE PROJECT DOWN?
this IS DIFFERENT.
is IT?
Collins' DEATH IS A POINTLESS WASTE OF LIFE
unless SOMETHING COMES OF THIS, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN...
I THINK I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
let's HEAR IT.
no. CAN I COME IN?
no.
the ANCIENTS HAD IT WRONG.
our MISTAKE WAS USING THEIR EQUATIONS.
look, I JUST DID THE CALCULATIONS AGAIN MYSELF.
I DID THEM THREE TIMES JUST TO BE SURE,
and I AM POSITIVE
the PROBLEM IS IN THE AUTOMATIC CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS.
okay, WHAT'S YOUR FIX?
I'm PROPOSING THAT WE ADJUST THE FIELD STRENGTH MANUALLY.
you SAW HOW FAST IT SPIKED ON YOU.
so WE DON'T OPERATE THE GENERATOR AT ANYWHERE NEAR ITS POTENTIAL.
look, THERE'S NO NEED TO BE GREEDY.
even OPERATING AT 50%
it'll STILL GENERATE THE POWER OF A DOZEN ZPMs.
how COME THE ANCIENTS DIDN'T FIGURE THIS OUT?
maybe THEY WERE CAUGHT UP IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE,
or MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED AS MUCH POWER AS THEY COULD GET.
maybe THEY WEREN'T SMART ENOUGH.
and YOU ARE?
no, I DIDN'T SAY THAT,
but I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT, THEY DIDN'T.
look, THIS IS BIG.
this IS THE WHEEL,
the LIGHT BULB...
the HOT DOG BIG.
best-case SCENARIO?
I WIN THE NOBEL PRIZE.
worst-case SCENARIO?
we TEAR A HOLE IN THE FABRIC OF THE UNIVERSE
which IS MUCH LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN THAN THE NOBEL PRIZE.
I MEAN,LOOK, THE RISKS ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS.
Elizabeth WILL LISTEN TO YOU.
I've NEVER ASKED THIS OF YOU BEFORE,
but I THINK I'VE EARNED IT
trust ME.
I've ALREADY MADE THIS DECISION, JOHN.
if DR. McKAY SAYS HE'S SOLVED THE PROBLEM,
I DON'T SEE WHY WE DON'T GIVE HIM ANOTHER SHOT.
isn't THE DAEDALUS ABOUT READY TO HEAD BACK TO EARTH?
Yes, WE ARE,
but I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
the PENTAGON HAS TAKEN A VERY KEEN INTEREST IN THIS VACUUM ENERGY.
I'm SURE THEY HAVE,
but THE PENTAGON DOESN'T MAKE THE DECISIONS HERE.
I MAY NOT HAVE THE POWER
to OVERRULE YOU ON THIS,
but WHEN I GET BACK TO EARTH,
I'm GOING TO BE MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION
that DR. McKAY BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE HIS WORK TO THE HIGHEST AUTHORITIES.
ultimately, DR. WEIR,
this WON'T BE UP TO YOU.
can RODNEY GUARANTEE
that THE SAME THING WON'T HAPPEN?
no. NOBODY CAN DO THAT.
then WHAT'S CHANGED? ACCORDING TO HIM,
it's THE ANCIENTS' CALCULATIONS THAT WERE WRONG, NOT HIS.
if McKAY IS THAT CONFIDENT, I DON'T SEE WHY
confidence IS NOT SOMETHING DR. McKAY IS IN ANY SHORT SUPPLY OF.
with GOOD REASON. IF ANYONE CAN DO THIS
the ANCIENTS COULD NOT DO THIS.
I MEAN,THAT'S WHAT IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO FOR ME.
isn't IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAVE PLACED THE ANCIENTS ON SUCH HIGH A PEDESTAL,
you CAN'T EVEN CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY
that THEY MAY BE WRONG?
why ARE WE MINCING WORDS, COLONEL?
you WANT THE WEAPON.
Yes.
I DO.
a WEAPON THAT COULD EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE WRAITH THREAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO ME,
and TO THE PEOPLE THAT I WORK FOR.
I'm NOT HIDING THAT FACT.
but THERE'S MORE TO IT, ISN'T THERE?
no MORE HUNTING FOR ZPMs,
the SHIELD AT FULL STRENGTH, FASTER,MORE POWERFUL SHIPS...
how ABOUT A POWER SOURCE THAT CAN PROVIDE THE ENERGY NEEDS FOR AN ENTIRE PLANET.
no MORE FOSSIL FUELS
I GET IT,
and IF IT WORKED AS ADVERTISED,
it WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
I'm TRYING TO TELL YOU
I KNOW RODNEY McKAY,
and THERE ARE TIMES
when I HAVE TO PROTECT HIM FROM HIMSELF.
I CAN DO THAT.
let ME GO BACK WITH HIM,
just HIM AND ME.
you CAN ACTIVATE THE STARGATE
any TIME YOU WANT
to CONTACT US BY RADIO.
he REALLY SOLD YOU.
Yes, MAY YOU TRUST
I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT, COLONEL, BUT DON'T WORRY.
I TRY TO MAKE IT A HABIT NOT TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.
that WAS A JOKE, RIGHT?
no.
I OFFER YOU MY PERSONAL ASSURANCE
that A SURGE LIKE THE ONE THAT HAPPENED BEFORE IS INCONCEIVABLE.
do YOU WANT TO RUN SOME POWER-UP SIMULATIONS FIRST?
how ABOUT I CARRY OUT MY PLAN,
and YOU KEEP THE HOT COFFEE COMING?
joking AGAIN, RIGHT?
now, WHERE WERE WE?
Dr. WEIR, I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU RIGHT AWAY.
what IS IT?
I've FINISHED GOING OVER THE ACCIDENT DATA.
I THINK I KNOW WHY THE ANCIENTS ABANDONED THIS TECHNOLOGY.
Colonel SHEPPARD, THIS IS ATLANTIS.
go AHEAD.
is DR. McKAY WITH YOU?
of COURSE I AM, BUT WE'RE A LITTLE BUSY
getting READY TO RUN A TEST HERE.
actually I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DELAYTHE TEST FIRING.
Why?
we HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
that THE WEAPON'S POWER SOURCE IT MAY NOT BE CONTROLLABLE AT ANY POWER LEVEL.
okay, WE HAVE BEEN OVER THIS.
I'm DOING THIS MANUALLY, AT HALF POWER.
it's A CAKEWALK.
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS HOW MUCH CAKE YOU WALK ON.
I've BEEN DOING CALCULATIONS OF MY OWN,
and I BELIEVE THE VERY ACT OF TRYING TO CONTAIN VACUUM ENERGY
from OUR OWN SPACE-TIME CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT
where THE LAWS OF PHYSICS CEASE TO APPLY.
what ARE YOU ON ABOUT?
as POWER OUTPUT INCREASES,
new AND EXOTIC PARTICLES ARE CONTINUOUSLY CREATED AND DESTROYED
inside THE CONTAINMENT CHAMBER,
interacting WITH EACH OTHER,
and WITH THE FIELD ITSELF.
eventually, PARTICLES ARE CREATED
that CANNOT BE PREDICTED IN THIS SPACE-TIME,
and THEY BREACH THE CONTAINMENT FIELD
as HARD RADIATION.
and AS LONG AS I'M MONITORING THE ENERGY OUTPUT MANUALLY,
I CAN STOP THAT BEFORE IT HAPPENS.
you CANNOT PREDICT SOMETHING
that IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
Rodney, I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU AS A FRIEND
I HAVE SERIOUS DOUBTS.
well, YOU'RE WRONG. SORRY, BUT THERE IT IS.
and TO BRING THIS UP NOW WHEN I'M ABOUT TO DO THIS
smacks OF NOTHING BUT PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY.
fine.
kill YOURSELF, JUST LIKE THE ANCIENTS DID.
whoa, WHOA, WHOA.
what DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
I BELIEVE IF THE OVERLOAD IS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE,
the WEAPON ACTS AS A SORT OF RELEASE VALVE TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC CONTAINMENT FAILURE.
the ANCIENTS BARELY MANAGED TO SHUT IT DOWN,
and THEY LOST THEIR LIVES IN THE PROCESS.
what WE'RE SUGGESTING IS THAT THE WRAITH DIDN'T KILL EVERYONE ON THAT PLANET.
it WAS THE WEAPON ITSELF.
that WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THIS PLACE IS THE ONLY THING LEFT STANDING.
congratulations, YOU'VE SOLVED THE MYSTERY
of HOW THE ANCIENTS SCREWED UP 10, 000 YEARS AGO,
doesn't MEAN THAT I WILL DO THE SAME.
look, I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO SAY THIS,
but NONE OF YOU ARE CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING THIS ON THE SAME LEVEL THAT I DO,
and ZELENKA, THAT INCLUDES YOU.
Rodney, I CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE EITHER ONE OF YOU.
now, TELL ME,
can YOU DO THIS?
Yes.
are YOU SURE?
Yes.
are YOU SURE YOU'RE SURE?
I SAID YES!
because IF YOU'RE WRONG
I'm NOT!
we'll CALL YOU BACK AFTER THE TEST.
how DOES THAT SOUND?
you'd BETTER.
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.
how ARE YOU FEELING?
fine.
we SHOULD REALLY BE GETTING BACK.
Dr. WEIR WILL BE EXPECTING US.
Kell IS HERE.
what?
he's MEETING WITH HENDON RIGHT NOW.
solen JUST TOLD ME.
I HAVE TO SEE HIM.
and YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ARRANGE A MEETING.
after YESTERDAY,
I DON'T THINK I'D GET VERY FAR IF I ASKED MYSELF.
okay, THIS IS GOOD.
my EQUATIONS ARE WORKING LIKE A CHARM.
power LEVEL IS AT 40%, JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.
I THINK WE'RE READY FOR OUR TEST.
where DO YOU WANT THE WEAPON TARGETED?
the DEBRIS ORBITING THE PLANET.
sounds GOOD.
bringing THE WEAPON ONLINE...
now.
what's THAT?
an ENERGY SURGE.
it's FINE.
I CAN REGULATE IT.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU COULD
the TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE CONTAINMENT FIELD IS WELL WITHIN ACCEPTABLE PARAMETERS.
I'm STAYING AHEAD OF IT.
the LEVELS ARE RISING IN THE CHAMBER.
re-route POWER FROM THE SECONDARY SYSTEMS TO THE CONTAINMENT FIELD.
I'm THINKING WE NEED TO ABORT.
I CAN COMPENSATE. JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.
it's OVERLOADING,
just LIKE LAST TIME.
there IS NO LOGICAL REASON THIS SHOULDN'T BE WORKING.
none OF THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING.
the ENERGY LEVELS ARE SPIKING AT A RATE FAR GREATER THAN ANYTHING I PREDICTED.
shut IT DOWN!
fine.
it DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
what's WRONG?
I CAN'T SHUT IT DOWN.
I AM KELL FROM SATEDA.
Teyla EMMAGAN OF ATHOS.
thank YOU FOR GRANTING US YOUR TIME.
if WE ARE TO TRADE,
I WOULD KNOW ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR PARTY.
of COURSE.
in FACT, THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE.
Hello, KELL.
Ronon, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?
we ALL KNOW WHO THIS MAN WAS,
what HE WAS.
if ANYONE HERE TO MURDER AN INNOCENT MAN.
he DESERVED WORSE.
you SAID HE WAS LIKE A FATHER TO YOU.
Kell COMMANDED SEVERAL INFANTRY DIVISIONS ON SATEDA,
and WHEN THE WRAITH CAME,
he ORDERED THOUSANDS TO THEIR DEATHS
just TO SAVE HIMSELF.
he WAS...
he WAS A TRAITOR
and A COWARD.
my ONLY REGRET IS THAT HIS DEATH WAS QUICK.
I UNDERSTAND.
in YOUR PLACE,
I MIGHT HAVE DONE THE SAME...
but BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU
that THE OTHERS WOULD NOT.
we MUST NOT SPEAK OF THIS
when WE RETURN TO ATLANTIS.
and IF YOU EVER USE MY FRIENDSHIP IN SUCH A WAY AGAIN,
I WILL NOT BE SO UNDERSTANDING.
what WAS THAT?
the WEAPON'S DISCHARGING
to PREVENT A CATASTROPHIC OVERLOAD.
all RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
we're OUT OF HERE.
what DID I JUST SAY?
the WEAPON IS FIRING AT RANDOM TARGETS ABOVE THE PLANET.
this IS THE SAFEST PLACE TO BE RIGHT NOW.
this PLACE WON'T BE SAFE FOR VERY MUCH LONGER
I CAN BRING IT BACK UNDER CONTROL.
just GIVE ME A SECOND.
no, YOU CAN'T.
one SECOND!
I've SEEN THIS BEFORE, RODNEY.
pilots WHO WOULDN'T EJECT WHEN SOMETHING WENT WRONG,
trying TO FIX THEIR PLANES
right UNTIL THEY HIT THE GROUND.
okay, WE NEED TO LEAVE.
I've WAITED TOO LONG.
the WEAPON CAN'T DISCHARGE ENOUGH POWER
to AVOID A CATASTROPHIC OVERLOAD.
this WHOLE PLANET IS GOING TO GO UP.
not THAT YOUR SPEECH WASN'T WORKING.
okay, STRAP IN.
you NEED TO AVOID FLYING IN PREDICTABLE TRAJECTORIES
to PREVENT THE WEAPON LOCKING ONTO US.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I'm JUST SAYING,
be SURE NOT TO FLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE.
Rodney, SHUT UP!
can I JUST SAY THERE'S NO WAY THE JUMPER CAN TAKE EVEN ONE DIRECT HIT?
I'll KEEP THAT IN MIND.
the WEAPON'S LOCKING ONTO US.
how ABOUT I FLY US AWAY FROM THE PLANET,
and RETURN AFTER THE OVERLOAD?
we CAN'T.
why NOT?
look, DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
this EXPLOSION IS GOING TO TAKE OUT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.
there's NO WAY WE CAN FLY FAR ENOUGH, FAST ENOUGH.
we HAVE TO HEAD FOR THE GATE.
dial THE GATE.
how DO YOU INTEND TO AVOID GETTING HIT ON THE FINAL APPROACH?
I HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT PART OUT YET.
it's A GOOD THING
we STOPPED BY TO CHECK YOUR PROGRESS, COLONEL.
make A BREAK FOR THE STARGATE.
we'll RUN INTERFERENCE.
copy THAT, DAEDALUS.
stand BY TO ENGAGE SUBLIGHT ENGINES ON MY MARK.
recommend YOU GO INTO HYPERSPACE AS SOON AS WE GO THROUGH.
there's GOING TO BE A BIG BANG.
understood.
take THIS GRAIN TO THE STORAGE ROOM.
...EVERYBODY ON THIS BASE.
you ARE THE SMARTEST MAN WE HAVE.
I KNOW!
...and YOU PUT YOUR LIFE AND OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES -AT RISK. -BUT
you DESTROYED THREE-QUARTERS OF A SOLAR SYSTEM!
FIVE-SIXTHS.
it's NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE.
Rodney, CAN YOU GIVE YOUR EGO A REST
for ONE SECOND?
Oh, COLONEL.
Colonel!
I've BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.
I HEARD.
I SUPPOSE I DESERVE THAT.
look, I JUST, UM...
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.
I WAS WRONG. I'M SORRY.
and I WANTED TO ASSURE YOU
that I INTEND ON BEING RIGHT AGAIN, ABOUT EVERYTHING,
effective IMMEDIATELY.
that WAS A JOKE.
good ONE.
I've ALREADY APOLOGIZED
and I THANKED COLONEL CALDWELL FOR CARING ENOUGH
to SPY ON THE EXPERIMENT FROM ORBIT.
sent HIM A NICE LITTLE EMAIL, ACTUALLY.
but I SAVED YOU TILL LAST
because, UM...
honestly, I WOULD...
I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT RECENT EVENTS
might HAVE PERMANENTLY DIMMED YOUR FAITH IN MY ABILITIES...OR YOUR TRUST.
at THE VERY LEAST, I HOPE I CAN...
I CAN EARN THAT BACK.
that MAY TAKE A WHILE.
I SEE.
but...
I'm SURE YOU CAN DO IT,
if YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY.
thought I was dead, didn't you Sheppard?
jace here has really fine tuned the enzyme.
we've gotten so good we can even lace food with it.
Congratulations.
you've just had your first dose.
you're gonna help us, destroy a Wraith hive ship.
there's been a slight change of plans.
McKay's going to stay here, while we run the op.
Sheppard, you there?
I think I might have set the alarm off.
what do you want?
the one who flew the ship.
and now the conclusion...
the ship.
where did you get it?
you mean the Dart?
we call them Darts because they're so pointy.
tell me.
where?
I really don't wanna say.
I don't even know your name.
in time, you will tell me every...
tell you what? What's wrong?
she didn't even tell me her name!
Colonel?
are you unharmed?
Yeah.
Where'd they take you?
a little Q and A with the Queen of the hive.
What'd you tell her?
it was a short conversation. She walked out.
Why?
I don't know. Maybe she was late for a meeting.
no. There's something else. I sense she was agitated, even angry.
Why?
another hive ship has arrived.
are you sure there's another ship?
I sense it... close by.
well, maybe they're planning on culling the planet together.
or they're gonna fight for it. - Either way, the planet's only a few days away, so we don't have much time if we still intend to stop them.
alright. First things first. How to get out. Any luck?
not yet.
don't worry... I'll figure a way out.
I was afraid you were gonna say that.
OK, they definitely should have been back by now.
seriously, am I the only one who thinks that maybe things haven't gone according the plan?
Yes.
OK, look, we can't just sit here. We need, we need to, we need to do something.
like what? - Like go get help!
look, we can dial the Stargate back to Atlantis where we have a ship...
a fast ship with, with, with shields. We can fly to the hive and then, then rescue them if we need to.
can't dial the Gate, remember? Ford removed the control crystals from the dialing device.
Yes, I know that. But here's the good news. You're the ones guarding them.
look, all you have to do is get me the crystals, I can fix the DHD.
and then then look, you just have to walk into Ford's little room back there and get them.
we're not giving you anything.
then I can't dial the Gate.
what I said.
what is this, an Abbott and Costello routine? Look, just give me the damned crystals!
you want the crystals, you're gonna have to go through us.
unbelievable!
last time we were on one of these ships, McKay was able to open the door by cutting right into the wall.
you mean like with a knife?
you have a knife?
one for them to find, one to keep. Everybody knows that.
right! Forgot all about that rule.
well, it's a good thing I'm here.
right! Now, just, take your time...
I said take your time!
I hit the exact spot you were pointing at!
alright, alright. Anybody else have a knife?
getting warmer.
how many of those things have you got?
how many d'you need?
OK, you can take them out, easy. Just a few well-placed karate chops and, and, and, and down they go.
piece of cake. Let's...
are you an idiot?
desperate times, desperate measures.
that's one hell of a karate chop!
you must have a hell of a time going through airports!
ford, what the hell are you doing?
that's the last of it. - What about the rest of us?
you don't need it. - You don't know that.
we're heading to the Dart Bay. Stay together, and stay quiet.
lock and load!
and that's what happens when you back a brilliant scientist into a corner!
now focus, focus.
Ah, control crystals! Yes!
wait.
they are coming.
I got it.
move!
more coming!
this way!
big dose! Big, big dose!
but you needed it. You needed it.
to lay out the guards... idiots!
you want the crystals? You're going to have to go through us.
well I went through you allright, didn't I?
like a hot knife trough jelly. No...
butter. Knife trough butter.
okay... Focus. Must finish dialing. Please, please...
OK, go home.
help us. Please, help us.
she's alive!
so is this one.
let's get them out of here.
we don't have time to stop. This isn't the mission!
there is no mission, Ford. There's just your stupid plan.
if you hadn't screwed up... - Look, the sooner you stop arguing with me and help me save these people, the quicker we get out of here.
unscheduled activation!
it's Doctor McKay's IDC.
lower the shield!
I know what I need to do!
Rodney, what's happened? Where are the rest...?
there's no time, no time. The planet... not Ford's, the one the...
ship's headed towards, we need to get there and we don't have much time.
I was barely able to escape myself, but I managed to take out the guards.
Oh, you should have seen me! I was amazing! I wish we'd got it on camera because... That's not the point.
Rodney, slow down. Are you alright?
Yes, yes. I mean... I don't know.
I mean, I did take out the guards and they were huge and dumb and stupid...
what guards?
ford's guards! Didn't I mentioned Ford?
no, you didn't, and you haven't even mentioned Sheppard, Teyla or Ronon either.
Yes! They were there too, and there were the two guards.
they were huge and massive and I had to take them out, so I had to inject some of the enzyme.
you took some of the enzyme?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no. I didn't take some of the enzyme.
I took a lot of the enzyme, because I had to, because I had to take out the guards, which I did, and you should have seen me, I was amazing!
are you insane?
Yes, yes, now that I've taken the enzyme, yes.
Rodney, focus. Where is Colonel Sheppard?
no, no, no, I had to take the enzyme because, because I had to take out the guards!
but that's not the point... the point is we don't have enough time.
we need to stop the ship from getting to where the ship is going.
come on, come on, let's take a walk to the Infirmary, alright?
what are you doing?
No-no-no-no, I don't wanna go to the Infirmary. I wanna go to the... the...
doctor Beckett, we have an emergency. We're headed to you.
move!
are you alright?
I think so.
you were shot by Wraith stunners. You both went down pretty quick.
the effects of the enzyme must be wearing off.
where are the others?
feeling better?
her name's Neera. Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard.
Hi.
where are the others?
they split us up into separate cells.
I guess the Wraith figured keeping us in smaller groups would make it tougher to escape.
we shouldn't have stopped.
what's done is done, Lieutenant. - No!
first you set off the alarms, and then you stop to rescue people when you know damned well the Wraith are on our tail?
it's like you're purposefully sabotaging this mission.
you hate to see me succeed at anything.
you've got a lot of issues to work out, Ford.
Teyla and Ronon went down too quick when they were shot.
the enzyme's wearing off.
you feeling anything yet?
not yet.
but I will.
it's happened before when I've run out of the enzyme.
it gets pretty bad.
so we gotta figure a way out of here.
and no more unnecessary stops.
Colonel Caldwell! I didn't think you were due back here for days.
doctor Weir requested that we join the search ASAP, so we pushed the engines a little.
how is he?
I've sedated him;
administered a beta blocker to bring his blood pressure down to a more manageable level.
it's a wonder he didn't suffer a stroke.
did he mention anything further about the location of Colonel Sheppard and his team?
nothing coherent, I'm afraid.
by the time he arrived here, he was hyperventilating, pulse extremely rapid.
he could barely get out a word...
although, being Rodney, he certainly tried.
how much of the enzyme did he take?
a very big dose, I'm afraid.
I found a significant amount of it in his system...
nearly as much as Lieutenant Ford.
alright... can you wean him off it?
I wish I could.
unfortunately, Lieutenant Ford took the last supply of our enzyme when he left Atlantis, so an incremental withdrawal is out of the question.
unless we harvest more enzyme.
not an option. By the time you go out and collect it, the enzyme will have broken down in his system already.
no, I'm afraid for Rodney the only choice is...
cold turkey.
aye, to put it bluntly.
I can administer some drugs to help ease the process, anti-nausea medication, pain reliever, benzodiazepine for anxiety, as well a sa multivitamin injection to bolster the immune system.
good.
but there's no dodging the fact it's gonna be difficult... possibly even deadly.
are you alright?
I'm just tired.
no.
the enzyme's leaving your bodies.
mine too.
how bad will it get?
bad. Maybe not for you.
you guys haven't been on the enzyme for long.
but me, on the other hand...
thank you.
How're you holding up, Lieutenant?
OK. I just need to get my hands on some more enzyme.
then I'll be able to get us out of here.
we'll do it together. With or without the enzyme, we're a team, remember?
I remember.
don't just stand there... get me more enzyme.
we don't have any.
it's the cave... Ford's cave... he's got a, a whole cabinet of it. There's, there's dozens of vials.
do you know the address?
what?
No!
I'm sorry, Rodney.
you don't have to scream at me!
I'm not screaming.
this is fun for you, isn't it, watching me like this?
I assure you, it's not.
what is this, payback? You're jealous?
jealous of how vital I am to this mission... vital, vital...
jealous of how I get to go offworld and, and you get stuck in this stupid, pathetic excuse for a hospital.
you know that's not true.
jealous I get all the women and you don't!
excuse me?!
please, just give me a little enzyme... just enough to take the edge off. I'm dying here.
I told you, we don't have any.
you think I don't know you're lying?
I'm not lying. - You are. You think I don't think you are but you are.
and don't think I won't forget it...
what?
I don't know! Just kill me.
I wish... It'll pass.
don't shout! I am right here.
perhaps we should move him to a more secluded area.
what... so you can kill me in private? Stab another knife in my back?
Rodney... no-one's trying to kill you.
you have no idea of the agony I'm going through.
Oh, I have an inkling.
Kanayo, you must be strong.
fight it!
I do not know what else to do for him.
there's nothing we can do.
he is dead.
is that what's gonna happen to us?
one less for you to feed on?
take him.
how is he?
asleep... finally. Mercifully.
has he mentioned anything about Sheppard and the others?
no, not yet.
our conversation was of a different sort.
I feel not unlike the priest in The Exorcist.
well, he's through the worst of it.
the nausea has passed, his pulse has returned to normal, blood pressure in a more reasonable range, considering his borderline hypertensia before taking the enzyme.
good.
I hate to say it but his stubbornness is probably what sustained him throughout the ordeal.
we won't tell him that, though.
aye... mustn't feed the beast!
No!
you should get some rest. You look exhausted.
I'll stay with him just a wee bit longer...
just to make sure he's out of the woods.
nice work.
Thanks, Elizabeth.
come on, buddy, hang in there. Don't leave us.
Yes, Sir.
I'm sorry, Sir.
no, none of that.
mission's not over, remember? We've still gotta figure a way to get out of here.
you hear me?
Yes, Sir.
Aiden. You can make it through this.
move away from him.
what are you gonna do with him? - Move away.
he's sick!
that is why we're taking him.
where? Where are you taking him?
to a cocoon.
it will preserve him... keep him from dying.
until they're ready to feed.
I'm sorry.
it's my fault you got caught, I should never have asked you to stop.
it's OK.
you were trapped in one of those cocoons, no-one can blame you for wanting out.
now your friend has taken my place.
well not for long, not if I can help it.
how will you get us out of here?
OK, I haven't figured that part out yet... but when I do, it's gonna be real impressive.
the Wraith will not allow us to escape.
Yeah, well, I try not to let them tell me what I can and can't do.
you do not fear them?
the Wraith? Naah.
now clowns... that's another story. Scare the crap out of me.
well, look at you.
ah yes, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, as the idiom goes.
you gave us quite a scare.
it was very strange.
the whole time I was under the influence of the enzyme, it felt like I was...
I was perfectly lucid... eloqent, even.
I mean it was you who wasn't making any sense or listening to reason. It was very peculiar.
I think I kind of understand how Ford must have been feeling this whole time.
what happened out there? And where are the others?
I don't know exactly, but I think I can figure it out. I told you Ford's alive.
well, you told me, but I didn't believe you.
the man is nothing if not resilient. He's been busy, too.
he gathered himself together a little gang, doped them all up on the enzyme.
they're the ones that caught us, drugged us, and coerced Sheppard, Teyla and Ronon to join them on a mission to destroy a hive ship.
a hive ship?!
Yeah, they managed to steal themselves a Dart. Like I said, he's been busy.
look, when they didn't return from the mission, I realised something had obviously gone wrong.
now, I have the coordinates to the planet that the hive ship was headed towards to cull.
so if the team is still alive...
maybe captured on the ship... there's a chance we can rescue them.
I'll alert Colonel Caldwell.
very good.
How're you feeling?
better.
you?
ready to get out of here.
have you had any luck finding a way to escape?
I think our only chance is to try to create a diversion...
try to overpower them the next time they come in here.
have you thought of Lieutenant Ford?
if his withdrawal was as severe as Kanayo's...
if it distracts you, clear your mind of it.
if it fuels your anger use it.
d'you have anything sharp...
knife, hairpin, anything that'd puncture the skin on these walls?
no.
it's just that everyone in my last cell had one, so...
your people were taken by the Wraith too?
a few.
my whole world was destroyed, and my people taken and brought here.
I watched as my own mother and younger brother were fed upon.
sorry to hear that.
we had no means to fight the Wraith. We are a simple, peaceful people.
we're peaceful too, but the good news is, we have the means to put up a hell of a fight.
you have fought the Wraith before? - Lots of times.
won some battles, lost some.
war's not over by a long shot, but we're managing to hold our own.
and the clowns?
the clowns? Oh, yeah, the clowns.
Yeah, we fight them too...
entire armies, spilling out of Volkswagens.
we do our best to fight them off, but...
they keep sending them in!
according to Ford's intel, Edowin has a space Gate.
if we can get there quickly in a Puddle jumper, we wouldn't be able to do much more than just warn people of the impending culling.
do we have enough time?
Yes. - We think.
we should. - We hope.
it'll be close, yes, but using the Daedalus we might be able to get a radio lock on
Sheppard and the team inside the hive ship. If they're still alive, we can beam them out.
alright. Let's get this bird off the ground.
coming with us? - No, no...
right!
for warmth.
OK.
how's that? Better?
Yes. Thanks.
how long will they keep us in here?
that's a very good question.
if we're able to escape, where will I go?
wherever you want.
can I go with you to your world?
sure. Why not?
I'm sure we can find a spare room.
I'd like that.
what is it like, your world?
it's nice... comfortable, good climate.
tell me what it looks like.
like every other world, I suppose
trees, water, mountains.
starbucks on every corner.
what is it called?
d'you mind if we pick this up after we get some sleep?
Yes, of course.
what is it?
I don't know.
must have just dropped out of hyperspace.
maybe they're getting ready for the culling.
take him.
shall we talk now?
about what?
you are stubborn.
Yes, I am... and, she's very pretty, by the way.
Neera... the girl you planted in the cocoon for us to rescue after you let us escape.
the one that was supposed to get information from me.
it's never gonna happen.
we drop out of hyperspace directly behind the planet...
use it to shield us from the hive ship and we can attempt radio contact with Colonel Sheppard.
but we won't be able to make radio contact from behind the planet.
this is why you and Major Lorne will take a cloaked Puddle Jumper to get close enough to determine if Colonel Sheppard and his team are still aboard the ship.
if they are, we'll move into position around the planet and beam them out.
and if they're not there?
we'll beam a nuke aboard the ship and destroy it.
what if they jam us like they did before?
doctor, you worry about getting Colonel Sheppard and his team out of that ship.
let me worry about destroying it, OK?
Ah, there you are.
I guess an empty room is off the table, but nice try back there in the cell.
I knew there must have been a good reason for you to let us break out, but that was quite the performance.
Where'd you find her?
she is one of many thousands that have come to serve us...
even worship us.
they do my bidding, and I let them live.
a Wraith-worshipper?
the prophecy of The Great Awakening has come to pass. The end of days have come to the...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know about that because, I'm one too.
although in my case, it's not so much worship as it is a meaningful business relationship.
you lie.
OK, tell me this.
how else could I get my hands on a Dart?
and who else could provide me with specific instructions on how to infiltrate your hive and destroy it?
of which queen do you speak?
you gotta have a window on this boat, don't you?
take a look.
the other hive that joined you for the culling...
a lot more people to feed on when you don't have to share.
I will speak to her of this.
you don't really think she'd admit to trying to have you killed, do you?
enough!
I shall savour your defiance!
how'd you get our weapons back?
that was the easy part.
getting some more enzyme... that was harder.
you're one tough son of a bitch!
what are you doing?
down that hall, fifty metres, turn left.
it'll take you to Teyla and Ronon's cell.
I'll hold the Wraith back for you.
you're coming with me.
I'll hold the Wraith back, boss. Now go. I'll be OK.
I'm not going without you, Lieutenant.
John. I'll catch up. Now GO!
Ford! Oh, crap.
get ready.
how about I bust you guys out of here?
if you don't mind.
I've gotta get myself one of these.
Where's Kanayo?
he is dead. Ford?
well, last I saw he was alive... I'm stickin' with that.
jumper One, you have a go.
on our way. Engaging cloak.
Oh, no.
there's two of them!
you said there was only one.
well, there was only one! - Now there's two!
I can see that!
let's try and hail Colonel Sheppard.
the culling is beginning.
we've gotta stop them.
how?
stay here. When I give you my signal, get out in the open.
jumper One, what's your status?
we're unable to establish a radio link with Colonel Sheppard or the others on either of the hive ships.
which doesn't necessary mean they're not on either of the ships. Look, they could have had their radios taken from 'em.
we can't make that assumption. Return to the Daedalus immediately.
almost there now.
good. We need to take those ships out before they start culling.
is that his signal?
it'd better be.
Oh, I sure hope that worked.
Max power to the shields.
are we within transport range?
Yes, Sir. We have a weapons lock on coordinates inside the first enemy vessel.
deploy warhead.
the enemy has engaged counter measures to block our transport.
they're jamming us again!
we're under fire.
forward rail positions, return fire!
this is not good.
not good, not good.
how much of this can the shields take?
not much. They're already down twenty percent.
our people have been in Wraith hands too long.
we have to assume they've been compromised and that the Wraith know that Atlantis wasn't destroyed.
we need to win this.
look... see that?
what?
it's a Dart firing on one of the hive ships.
Why?
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other!
the blast has destroyed everything in a fifteen thousand metre radius.
did any Darts survive?
negative, Sir.
copy that. Atlantis out.
doctor Weir?
we received word from Daedalus.
they said they should be back to Atlantis by nineteen hundred hours.
they called the search off?
they said there was nothing to search for.
thank you.
offworld activation!
who is it?
we have an IDC.
it's Colonel Sheppard's code!
let them in!
sorry we're late.
alright. Up you go.
why aren't you dead?
Ah, it's good to see you too, Rodney.
no, no, I mean... well, you know what I mean. Why aren't you... dead?
well, I knew when the hives started to shoot at each other, it was just a matter of time before they blew each other up, so I went to the space Gate and dialed an address where I could land safely.
I didn't think the Dart could fit in our Gateroom.
the Colonel was kind enough to make us whole again, and we returned home.
I'm curious, Sheppard... how did you know the Wraith would fight each other?
a little intel from Ford in the game, plus...
well, I kinda goosed things along with the Queen.
it would appear the Wraith are becoming more territorial than we had thought.
there is definite tension building among them.
which is good for us.
certainly is.
it also opens a brand new strategy in fighting them.
and, and, where is Ford?
he was aboard the hive ship when it was destroyed.
he was last seen aboard the hive ship.
what does that mean?
well, you know Ford. I wouldn't be surprised if we run into him again.
we must go faster, rodney.
this is pretty much my top gear!
we can take them.
negative. We don't how many we're up against!
Rodney, dial the damn gate. Don't wait for us!
as if the bullets whizzing past my head weren't encouragement enough!
okay, six, seven.
this is mckay to atlantis. We're coming in hot.
good to see you again, colonel.
common Ground
anything?
there was no sign of colonel sheppard or our attackers.
and they covered their tracks well.
there's a good chance he was transported off-world so I've gathered the last gate addresses dialed.
that should be helpful.
but since the transmission which summoned us to the planet was sent using a code we gave to the genii that will be our starting point
are you going to ask the genii if they took sheppard?
Yes, I am.
so is this
Yes, it is.
incoming wormhole.
we're receiving the new identification code.
security teams, stand by.
lower the shield.
welcome, ladon.
I came as soon as I-- - what've you done with sheppard?
he is here as our guest.
how can I help?
I didn't kill you last time, remember?
you promised me points for that.
dammit.
I should have killed him.
you're wasting your breath.
didn't know I had company down here.
there is no escape.
Yeah, well prisons are like that.
never stopped me before.
how long have you been down here?
many years.
how many is many? Five? Ten?
it no longer matters.
that many, huh?
what did you do to get here?
I merely allowed myself to be captured alive.
same here.
look, I've got people looking for me.
when they find me, maybe we can both
move
where are we moving to?
I kind of like it here.
commander kolya insists.
Oh, he insists?
why didn't you just say so?
pick him up.
I'm sorry this is necessary but under the circumstances, I'm sure you understand
I came here as a friend, dr. Weir. I hope to leave as one.
we appreciate your concern for colonel sheppard.
despite the fact that it was your incompetence that led to his capture.
I'm sorry, but there is no disputing the fact that it was a code we provided the genii that was used to lure us to that planet where we were ambushed.
Dr. Mckay is quite correct.
you entrusted us with codes, and I allowed them to be stolen from us.
how and by whom is an ongoing investigation, but I must assume it was someone close to me.
or this is part of your plans.
excuse me?
it would not be the first time.
I say this rhetorically since I should think it is obvious but if I were involved in this in any way or if my intentions were anything less than honorable would I have come to atlantis?
with you, who knows?
all I know is my friend has been kidnapped and you had something to do with it.
which is why I have walked away from significant responsibilities as leader of my people to come here and offer our help.
now, you can either let me do that or you can continue to berate me for my mistake
the choice is yours - Oh, we have more choices than that. - Ronon!
I see no reason to stay here if this is how I am to be treated.
trust me, you're not goin' anywhere.
Ronon, I understand how you feel.
believe me, I do.
but we're going to deal with this my way.
let's continue this in my office...
privately.
it's been some time.
you must have really missed me to go through all this trouble.
nice harpoon, by the way.
to capture an extraordinary soldier takes extraordinary measures.
I'll take that as a compliment.
as you should, colonel just as you should understand this is not personal.
as soon as my goal is achieved, you'll be returned to atlantis.
that simple, huh?
what do you want?
it's not a question of what I want.
it's a question of who.
I entrusted the idc codes you provided to two men in my government
my second minister, in the event of my death and my personal assistant, cassel massan.
I trust both of these men implicitly
or rather, I did.
are both men now accounted for? - Yes.
in fact, they're in custody.
they're being questioned as we speak.
Really?
don't underestimate the importance of this alliance between our two peoples to the genii, dr. Weir.
in fact, when I heard the news, my first concern was
we have an unscheduled off-world activation!
identification code?
none, but we're receiving an analog video signal.
bring it up.
Dr. Weir, if you're receiving this, please respond.
who the hell is he?
a genii military leader who once tried to seize atlantis.
ladon was a member of his strike team.
I do know you are there, doctor.
the existence of atlantis is no secret among the genii.
it would be pointless not to answer.
open a channel.
this is dr. Weir.
Oh, good.
I wanted to be certain you were there to see this.
what have you done to him?
nothing whatsoever, dr. Mckay.
okay, let me rephrase that. What are you planning to do?
it's quite simple.
I'd like to make a trade.
before we continue this conversation another second
I want to speak with sheppard.
be my guest.
we'll rephrase that, too.
we would like him to be able to speak to us.
very well.
on my command authority whatever he asks, don't do it, even
well, as you can see, he's his usual charming self.
explain your terms, kolya.
I have heard the familiar voices of yourself and dr. Mckay, but there is one person I know is there who has yet to speak
ladon radim is with you, is he not?
why would ladon be here?
to preserve his alliance with you, doctor.
so that the genii might remain in the favor of atlantis.
my sources have already confirmed this so there is no point in denying the fact.
turn him over to me and colonel sheppard will be released immediately.
I'll need time to consider your offer.
allow me to help expedite your decision.
Oh, my god.
Sheppard could have left you rot down in that hole when we last met, kolya.
he does not deserve this.
let's be clear, dr. Mckay.
no one does.
don't do this.
don't do it.
the choice is yours, dr. Weir.
do we have an arrangement?
very well.
stop!
stop!
enough!
you just crossed a line, kolya.
we found a minimum of three hours between feeding sessions is crucial to ensure the body has sufficient time to recover from the trauma.
that's the time you have to decide.
three hours.
they called you Sheppard.
yeah... That's my name.
pleased to meet you.
you are in pain?
well, I just got fed on by a wraith, what do you think?
I would not know.
hopefully, you'll never have to find out.
I didn't think anything could hurt that much.
you're still alive.
Yeah, well...
I don't know how many years the darn thing took off my life but I'll tell you this if kolya's men hadn't pulled that damn thing off
I'd be dust in a flak jacket.
do you blame the wraith or the master?
I'm gonna go with both.
there is a difference.
the wraith must feed in order to live.
for a wraith, hunger burns like a fire.
tell me, sheppard, if you found yourself burning alive, would you settle for just one drop of water?
or would you take more...
when did you hear them call me sheppard?
just before I started to feed.
of course, you would see him only as the monster who tried to take your city from you.
Kolya also killed several of our people.
he would have killed dr. Weir as well.
I won't make excuses for his actions or mine during the failed atlantis mission
we were soldiers under cowan's orders
but that failure shattered kolya's stature among the genii and forced him from cowan's inner circle
you managed to stay.
cowan had no choice but to keep me.
I was his chief scientist.
and you just left kolya out in the cold.
that was his choice not mine
I will admit, in what little contact we had before kolya went underground, he spoke of overthrowing cowan's corrupt regime
I was admittedly torn.
out of loyalty to cowan?
out of the belief that neither man had what it took to lead the genii into the future.
so instead, you-- having what it took
overthrew cowan yourself
Kolya believes I've taken his rightful place as leader of our people.
no wonder he's pissed.
well, obviously, he has men loyal to him in your inner circle hence the codes
those traitors will be found.
sounds like you're the traitor to me.
must he be here?
the more I hear the more I'm glad he is.
I could have told you anything. I chose to tell you the truth.
if you trade my life for sheppard you'll not only be yielding to blackmail but you'll be planting the seeds of civil war
so what?
I say we turn him over, let 'em fight it out.
we can't do that.
why not?
because...
can we?
Colonel sheppard has already ordered us not to.
at this point, it's not his decision.
there's still time for us to find him and launch a rescue operation. Has there been any progress?
we have a list of planets where recent genii activity has been documented but we'd have a much higher margin of success if ladon would be willing to point out firm locations of genii safe houses and shelters maybe even hidden wraith-infested torture chambers
your anger will only weaken you.
I don't think so.
you realize he is torturing both of us.
Oh, yeah?
What'd he do to you?
he stopped me.
Really?
and how is that torture?
have you ever known starvation, sheppard?
the few years I took from you are barely enough to keep me alive.
the strength I gained from you is already fading.
I don't really give a damn.
you pace in your cell cursing that I took years from you...
I stand here cursing that I was not allowed them all.
each in our own way we suffer
this might come as a surprise to you but I'm not really in the mood for conversation
so why don't you just do me a favor and shut the hell up!
these are your last hours, sheppard.
if you wish to spend them in silence...
then so be it.
no.
I'm getting out of here.
I've got a life to go back to and I'm damn well going back to it.
you're sure of that.
yeah
I've got friends.
and they're going to come for me.
I hope you continue to believe that...
the next time I feed.
Elizabeth, I'm just saying, if you decide in favor of trading for colonel sheppard it would be best if you did so before the next feeding.
I honestly don't know how many sessions a man can take even someone as strong as colonel sheppard
is it possible he can recover from this?
we still know so little about the feeding process.
all I can tell you is that each time he's fed upon his chances of survival diminish severely.
Dr. Weir!
we've got a match!
we went through the database.
between our list and ladon's, there's only one potential location that makes any sense.
go.
all right, people, let's do this one by the numbers.
we get in, we get our man, we get out.
stay sharp and stay alive.
what are you on about?
Oh, just things that sheppard would say, so I thought I would...
well said, rodney.
just stay behind me.
right.
just bring him back.
I thought you said this wasn't personal.
the truth is, I would've settled for dr. Mckay.
but I don't imagine I would enjoy his constant wailing.
they're never going to make the trade, kolya. Why don't you just finish this?
I think you underestimate the sympathetic nature of dr. Weir.
then you underestimate elizabeth.
you'd prefer I stormed atlantis and take ladon by force?
you've got...
half a dozen men and a starving wraith?
Yeah, you go right ahead.
one way or the other, ladon is mine.
protecting him is a waste of my time and your life.
What'd he do to you?
I was the one planning to overthrow cowen.
ladon disclosed those plans, forcing me underground then staged a coup of his own
he took what was rightfully mine
bring in the wraith.
just the caretaker
I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I just
you know, I reacted.
what is it?
A...mouse.
really big one, though.
more of a rat, really. Possibly rabid.
this isn't the place, is it?
I do not believe so.
no.
Sheppard wasn't here.
and we've just wasted two and a half hours.
move out!
and a mouse.
your intel was wrong.
well, then the only way for me to help is to return to my home world and mobilize the resources of my military.
you can contact them from here.
do you think I don't know the real reason you're keeping me here?
you're a head of state
it was john sheppard's last order that we do not submit to kolya's demands
it is my own country's policy to never yield to terrorists.
those are the reasons you are still here, mr. Radim.
because believe me, if it was simply my choice
I understand. - Good.
now we don't have much time.
I want you to look over our list of planets again - see if there's anything-- - unscheduled off-world activation!
looks to be another video feed.
patch it through and open a channel.
Dr. Weir as promised
Where's sheppard?
I'm pleased to see you're wasting no time.
so neither will I.
will you turn ladon radim over to me in exchange for colonel sheppard?
Dr. Weir?
no.
I can only conclude you doubt my sincerity.
enough
three hours.
where are your friends?
they'll be here.
you still believe that.
Yeah, I do.
they just need more time.
no one has ever left this place alive.
well, I'm going to.
Kolya will kill you before your friends can reach the cells.
how well do you know the layout of this place?
well enough to know what they would be up against.
what about us?
do you know enough about this place to get us out?
you and me...
are they going to let you go after I'm dead?
no.
then what do you got to lose?
my life.
Oh, yeah, you've got a great one down here.
listen it makes sense.
we have a common goal
as I said before...
there is no escape.
move
he still has years ahead of him, dr. Weir.
my offer stands.
so does my answer.
then you're effectively ending his life.
I'm not going to go there.
is ladon there?
I am.
I can't help but wonder what you've told them so they choose you over one of their own.
that I betrayed you.
that I took for myself what you believed to be yours.
the truth?
I must say I'm surprised.
if you release him , you may return to our people with my promise of amnesty.
please, ladon, I trained you better than that.
there are things that cannot be undone.
that's not true.
you can end this.
strange, doctor
I was just about to say the same thing.
take your fill
who told you to stop?
he's near death.
shall I finish him?
get it out of here.
now it's two hours.
if he's fed upon again, he's as good as dead.
we don't know that.
aye, rodney, we do.
he may already be past the point of no return.
we know that a large percentage of those that survive a partial feeding die anyway...
due to complications as a result of strain on the system.
what appears as physical aging is actually a byproduct of a complex process we barely understand
I can't imagine him surviving another session whether it's two hours or 10 hours from now.
if you were half the man sheppard is you'd volunteer to make the trade yourself.
the truth is
I'm not sure whether or not I would have made the trade if our roles were reversed.
so I ask you allow what you have done for me to be worth something
there is nothing more I can do here but I can get you the information you need to find sheppard if you allow mto return and interrogate the men who stole the codes from me.
you know, I could've sworn I was going to wake up dead today.
you are strong.
stronger than any human I have ever fed upon.
you stopped yourself.
yes
Why?
because the longer I feed the weaker you become...
and we will need what strength you have left to escape
now he wants to escape
I lack the words to thank you, dr. Weir
I didn't do this for you.
well, nevertheless
I'll be in touch the moment I have the information that you need.
thank you.
why do I have the sinking feeling we've just made a terrible mistake?
because we have.
I am not so sure, ronon.
which way?
this way.
it will heal.
this way.
they did this together.
they've taken weapons.
I want 10 armed men at the stargate.
the rest of you, hunt them down.
how far is the stargate?
it will be guarded.
we've got guns.
they will be waiting for us.
don't be so negative.
you think you're going to make it?
if I feed.
well, don't look at me.
when we make it to the stargate, we both go our separate ways
until then, we're going to need each other.
deal?
Dr. Weir?
how long has it been?
it's coming up on two hours.
we should receive the next transmission any minute now.
Yes, I'll be there in a moment.
I was blindfolded all the way to the bunker. It wasn't this far.
if I could just move faster
we'll rest here a few minutes
you should go on without me.
no.
the gate's guarded.
we'll have a better chance of taking out the guards in a crossfire
I still need you.
very well.
that is, even if we're going in the right direction.
you have no idea where the stargate is, do you?
it was many years ago.
way to go, john
listening to a wraith.
it was not my intention to deceive you, sheppard.
our reinforcements have arrived at the stargate, commander.
kill the wraith on sight, but I want sheppard alive.
well we learned two things
one, he likes me better than you
two, we probably never would've made it to the stargate anyway.
then it is over.
no.
our people don't leave each other behind
that's three things you've learned.
you still believe that?
Kolya doesn't know where we are.
he's wasting manpower that could be used searching for us guarding the gate.
the odds of my people finding us are going up and up.
you are more like wraith than you know.
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
there is much about a wraith that you do not know, sheppard.
kolya's late.
that is not like him.
we haven't heard anything from ladon either.
we will.
is it possible they were in on this from the beginning?
no. I don't think so.
why would ladon come here in the first place?
throw us off the scent.
what kind of a plan would that be?
true
either way, there must be a reason why kolya has not contacted us.
perhaps he knew it would take colonel sheppard more time to recover.
none of us are saying what we're all thinking here.
no, rodney, we're not
tell kolya there's nobody around the gate.
sounds like they're concentrating their search around the gate.
they must think we knew where we were going.
it was worth it...
if only to see the sky again.
I got slightly higher expectations.
my wound is deep.
if I do not feed soon...
I will die.
buck up.
we got a deal, remember?
we both go home alive.
and if we were to meet again in the future?
what then?
all bets are off.
then let us hope we do not meet again.
try to get some sleep. I'll take the first watch.
I'm receiving the new genii idc along with the video feed.
put it on the screen.
are you receiving me?
we were starting to get worried.
Yes, I'm sure you had doubts but the truth is, the interrogation took longer than I hoped.
we've secured the location of kolya's base. I'm forwarding you the dialing coordinates right now.
are you certain?
certain enough to send a full brigade through.
it will take us an hour to marshall our forces.
I thought you might want that time.
what will we be up against?
nothing one of your cloaked jumpers and ronon couldn't handle.
I ask only that you leave kolya for my own forces to find.
no promises.
I understand.
all right, get a cloaked jumper and a team of marines.
I'd like to reserve one of those seats for a member of the medical team.
done
and if you do find kolya...
no promises.
exactly
they're coming.
the facility is straight ahead.
we're detecting life signs on the surface, miles from the bunker.
how many?
when it first came up, it was eight... then four...
I don't get it, now it's just two.
what's going on down there?
one of them is definitely sheppard. His subcutaneous transmitter is still broadcasting.
could the other one be kolya?
let's hope so.
land a hundred meters to the south of their position.
finish it
as I told you there are many things about wraith that you do not know.
wait!
leave him.
that's an order.
I don't understand. We saw what he did to you.
he just undid it.
lower your weapons.
how is this possible?
don't ask me.
the gift of life is reserved only for our most devout worshipers...
and our brothers.
I guess there's a lot about the wraith we don't know
Sheppard gave me back my life.
I merely repaid the debt.
what debt? Are you kidding? He looks younger than he did before.
what about kolya?
Kolya, this is sheppard.
kolya? I figured you'd run.
next time, I kill you on sight, you hear me?
let's get off this rock.
what about him?
we had a deal, right?
I did not truly expect you to honor it.
you didn't kill him.
no, I didn'T.
get him in the jumper. We'll drop him off somewhere.
thanks for showing up.
I thought you...
there's a lot you don't know about humans
I see.
next time we meet?
all bets are off.
where are we going? - Atlantis
our intention is to destroy it.
Why?
retribution
it's an Ancient warship.
the city is now under my control.
they needed to know how much time we needed to vacate the city.
I said forty-eight hours.
the Pegasus Replicators are heading back to Atlantis.
Atlantis is under attack from Replicators.
request immediate evacuation!
they're coming!
general O'Neill and Woolsey may still be alive.
now, I know the city like the back of my hand.
just give me sixty marines and some of Colonel Carter's new, um ...
anti-replicator weapons
Yeah, those things.
I'm sorry, Colonel. I have standing orders.
the Daedalus will be there in a little under four days.
we need for one of us to be added to the authorised personnel list and there's only one guy who can do that.
I gotta say, I have never met a woman this into World of Warcraft!
Colonel Sheppard, stand down!
general?
general?
and if I'm a Replicator?
then I just exposed my position.
again
I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this.
here
thank God! I'm starving!
is this all you could find?
no ? actually there was a lovely buffet.
how did the recon go?
well, the Stargate Ops is crawlin' with 'em.
there's no way we're gonna get across to the Jumper Bay.
are they looking for us?
I plum forgot to ask.
as long as the life signs detectors aren't working in these damaged areas we should be able to hold out until they rescue us.
uh, Richard there's not going to be a rescue.
what?
Landry has standing orders to nuke the city if there's any sign of a foothold situation.
what kind of a standing order is that?!
mine.
what's happening?
activate the shield.
I can't.
that's confirmation.
the Gate shield has lowered.
I hope this little plan of ours works.
Ah, you and me both.
authentication code Alpha Six Delta Charlie Niner.
general O'Neill, Woolsey ? do you copy?
sheppard? Is that you?
Yes, sir
I need to know if you're anywhere near Stargate Operations.
no, we're not.
that's good.
can't talk right now, sir. I'll get back to you in a couple of hours. Sheppard out.
drop the package.
package is ... away.
hold on.
follow me.
that went well.
that sounded like an explosion.
because it was.
is Sheppard attacking the city?
he'd better be.
why can't he get back to us for two hours?
I don't know.
it's coming up on 23: 00 hours, sir.
I can see that, Chief.
Yes, sir.
I have to assume Sheppard heard my message and chose to ignore it.
there's no way to be a hundred percent certain, sir ...
he heard me alright. They're already in Pegasus doing goodness knows what.
which leaves me no choice but to lock out their IDCs and invalidate their personal authentication codes.
but sir, if they're successful in rescuing ...
we have no way of knowing whether they've been successful or if they've been compromised.
I have my standing orders and I'm damned well gonna follow them.
now, when you're done locking out those IDCs have Doctor Lee report to my office.
Yes, sir.
it's good to be back ? however briefly.
I feel like I'm gonna be ill.
don't be.
alright, just take some deep breaths, Carson.
aye
should we not have informed General O'Neill of our plan?
he knows we're here.
we'll contact him again as soon as we get closer to the city.
well, that is gonna be easier said than done.
with all those hits we took it's gonna be impossible for me to convert the shield back to a cloak.
and by "impossible," you mean ...
I mean "not possible." What do you think I mean?
hopefully we took out the sensors when we blew the tower.
well, you said they could rebuild remarkably fast.
how long before they restore critical systems?
a couple of hours?
plus the painting and redecorating.
if we time this right this could work to our advantage.
got him!
right where we left him!
that's him.
who else would it be?
true
his power levels are barely registering
it's no wonder the Replicators didn't find him.
alright, I'll swing around and pick him up.
watch yourselves ? I'm closing the bulkhead.
will we not be vulnerable to the same nanovirus with which Niam infected Elizabeth?
he's been floating in space for over a month now.
existing in such a harsh environment direct solar radiation has severely diminished his power levels
we're fairly certain he's almost completely incapacitated.
is he dead?
as in "mostly dead."
besides, we don't have a choice.
he's the key to our whole plan.
alright
but if he even twitches ...
don't worry.
thank you!
got him.
closing the rear hatch.
take the seat.
the compartment's re-pressurised.
this is good.
his power levels are minimal but not too minimal.
I'm fairly sure he doesn't have the juice to regain consciousness ...
I was ... fairly sure.
just load the programme.
repairs are under way in Stargate Operations but we have lost all main sensors.
we are trying to route all the telemetry through these terminals but they were not designed to take on so many systems.
we have stationed several observers around the city.
if the Gateship returns, we will detect it visually.
they communicated briefly with someone within the city.
we'll send search parties here and here.
all of the Ancients were killed.
their commander attempted to conceal that fact as I probed her mind.
there may have also been a small number of humans.
we would have detected them.
they may be hiding where the sensors are inoperable.
if we want to capture the ones who attacked us, we must first capture those they came for.
well?
done yet?
I think we're good to go.
alright. I'll take us back.
why don't we do this from here?
do what from here?
render the Replicators helpless, Rodney?
remember the plan?
of course I remember the plan. It's my plan.
uh, actually, using Niam was Elizabeth's plan.
thank you!
it was mostly my plan.
it was my freezing programme.
you said they'd be frozen in place six or seven hours. Why not do it now?
because I've gotta keep Niam at nominal power levels, otherwise we risk him waking up.
look ? low power means short range.
short range means we need to get closer.
how much closer? - Much.
with no cloak? - No cloak.
good to be back home, huh?
Hmm! There's no place like it.
I realise I was duped, General, but they were incredible. It was like a scene out of "The Sting.
calm down, Bill. That's not why I brought you in here.
in my defence, this was obviously something they had planned for a long time ...
forget about it.
I'd like to know your opinion on the best way to disable the Gate Bridge between galaxies.
we just finished building that.
I'm aware of that.
OK. Uh, well, umm ...
I ? I suppose if one were to detonate a Mark Nine at the midway station, that'd pretty much do it.
I thought so. I'd like you to supervise the preparation of a Mark Nine to keep our options open.
you know, you could always dismantle it. Of course, it would take a bit more time ...
which we may not have.
Wow. That ? that is such a shame.
doctor?
why are you still in my office?
uh, right.
alright we're about a mile out.
OK, I'll start broadcasting the virus now, but, uh, we're gonna need to get closer than that.
Drones!
we're still not close enough.
hang on!
that sounded like another explosion.
Yes. Yes, it did.
what does that mean?
something exploded.
but is it Sheppard attacking the Replicators, or the Replicators attacking Sheppard?
we'll find out!
how did they even get here?
through the Gate?
I've been sitting next to you through the whole thing.
why do you think I have more information?
look
I told you I wasn't good at this.
he said he'd be back in a couple of hours.
that gives him a good ... eleven seconds.
what was that?
if we keep this up, there won't be much of a city left to save.
I'll try to run the drones into your least favourite buildings.
it should be working.
well, it's not working!
if I give him any more power, he'll wake up and kill us all!
Sheppard can't keep this up forever.
shields have been damaged.
alright, I've had enough. I've got a different idea.
they're overdue.
not yet.
it's been well over eleven seconds.
yes
but you've been ignoring the dramatic element of ...
... suspense.
general O'Neill. Are you there, sir?
see?
Oh, thank God!
Yes, we're here.
you're late.
sorry, sir. Had to go into space and pick up some ... frozen goods.
whatever. Where are you now?
we're not exactly inside the city yet.
we're headed toward an underwater Jumper Bay.
well, what we think may be an underwater Jumper Bay.
is that Doctor Weir I hear?
Yes, General. It's good to hear your voice too.
I didn't say it was good, Elizabeth.
please, don't be offended as I express my ...
surprise that Landry would send you on a mission like this.
well, sir, General Landry didn't sanction this mission.
you've got Colonel Sheppard, Ronon, Teyla, McKay, myself and Doctor Beckett.
doctor Beckett, is it?
well, I'm comforted.
what's that supposed to mean?
ready to open the lock.
we've got a plan, sir ...
a good one.
Yes, Colonel,
I'm sure you do.
but in the unlikely event you don't fail miserably you're fired.
Yes, sir. ...
look forward to that.
they have a plan.
I heard.
careful
Thanks, Doc!
closing the outer door.
now, I just have to pressurise the compartment and we are ...
huh?
what?
it's not letting me do it.
the water's not draining out.
Yeah, excellent observation, thank you.
it is, however, draining in.
Oh, not again.
I guess we took some damage.
I just wanna point out that this was not my idea.
you said, "Get us close to the city." This is pretty damned close!
and yet, no cigar!
alright. Just open up the outer doors ? I'll figure something else out.
right.
Ohhhh ... dear.
what?
I don't think I'm gonna be able to open the outer door.
why not?
I think it might be jammed.
"might"?
OK, "is."
well, that's unfortunate.
Yeah, I'd have to agree with you on that.
this part of the plan isn't going so well.
there must be a manual override somewhere.
in the Bay's Control Room, yes.
OK, I'll swim to it.
which is sealed from the other side.
of course it is!
perhaps General O'Neill can reach it.
good
OK, give me half an hour to get Niam to the right power level so we can do this.
we've got more than one fracture. We don't have that kind of time.
general O'Neill?
we're gonna need a favour.
OK, there should be a hatch leading down to the next level. Do you see it?
Yep. Sure do. We see it.
the Control Room should be almost directly below.
OK, slight problem here.
what's that?
well, the level below is completely flooded too.
I, uh, couldn't convince you to take a swim today, could I?
alright.
if you hear something, don't call out to it.
shoot it.
understood
anything that's not me is a Replicator, so don't hesitate.
you won't be gone long, will you?
uh, kinda depends on the temperature of the water.
not long.
what do I do once I get down there?
it's a manual override.
it should be in the centre of the console. It'll be obvious once you get in there.
alright
good luck.
thank you.
alright, here we go.
did you do it?
radio - McKay. - Did you do it?
you and I have very different ideas of what "obvious" is.
well, I've never seen it before!
there are dozens of controls down there I wouldn't even know how to describe.
well, it's an emergency control. It should be among the most prominent.
God
God, you can hold your breath a long time!
me too.
general
it sounded like you had the right control. Why did you stop?
it's a dead man's switch.
I have to hold it in place.
I had no idea.
Really?
he's doing it!
he's almost done!
tell him, like, thirty more seconds and we're ...
I can do this.
Woolsey, come in.
something's wrong.
you stay here and reprogramme Niam.
we're gonna go and meet General O'Neill and Woolsey, alright?
we'll wait for your OK.
don't move.
where are the others?
what others?
they have been captured?
Yeah, looks like.
which means their minds will be probed for information any minute now.
fire up that virus.
I am working as fast as I can.
the Replicators have O'Neill and Woolsey.
unfortunately, that information can't make me work any faster.
this way.
what were you doing in the flooded sections of the city?
the backstroke ...
I think.
what are you planning?
well, I was planning to retire ...
but, man is that over-rated
I mean, It's not like I'm a workaholic or anything but, you know, I like to stay active ...
with the community. It's ...
it's a health maintenance sort of thing ...
you know?
I don't like where this is going.
what are they doing?
what you doin'?
probing your mind.
kinda roomy, ain't it?
your ability to resist is quite remarkable, General O'Neill.
it's not the first time I've had a hand in my head as it were.
if you do not give me what I am looking for
I'm sure Richard Woolsey will.
I'll tell you what you look around and I'll tell you if you're gettin' warmer or colder, alright?
there it is.
so ...
hot, I guess.
that was the worst thing I've ever experienced.
yeah
it gets worse.
OK, if I ...
that should ...
Yeah. OK, yes.
stand by.
I've got his power levels about as high as I'm comfortable with.
I'm gonna try to get him to ...
you've been warned about tampering with our base code, Doctor.
you won't get a second chance.
come in, McKay.
fall back to the Jumper!
we're gonna need a new plan.
he just came to life?
they must have got to O'Neill and Woolsey.
O'neill would've never given us away.
obviously their minds were probed.
well, they know we're here and how we got in.
which is how they were able to reactivate Niam which pretty much screws Plan A.
could you activate the freezing programme another way?
no. I need to load the programme directly into a Replicator and spread it that way.
alright, so that plan's out the window.
we need another one.
well, these weapons blow them apart, right?
I say we just start killing 'em.
well, normally I would share your run-and-gun enthusiasm but these weapons are only gonna work for so long before they manage to identify the frequency they use to disrupt the bonds that hold the Replicators together.
What'd he say?
they build up an immunity.
exactly
look, the freezing plan would have worked because they would be unable to communicate with each other while we were blasting them but the more we shoot the greater the likelihood these weapons are gonna become ineffective.
OK, so what are our options?
I just gave you one.
we'll call that ...
plan B.
anyone for a Plan C?
C4. How much do we have?
a bunch. Why?
well, it's desperate ...
well, so are we.
we need to split into groups.
I was gonna suggest that anyway.
Why? What are you thinking?
we far outnumber them. If we conduct a search ...
we will be able to locate them more effectively once repairs are complete.
the damage was severe.
we had to dismantle our ship to provide the raw materials.
once repaired
Atlantis will be all the ship we need.
well, it's about time!
Oh, thank God!
alright, get 'em out of here. I'll stand guard.
Hey!
thanks for the rescue!
Oh, hey! No problem.
No!
you should be saying, "Thanks for the rescue"!
Oh! Uh, right.
Thanks.
should have you outta there in no time.
this won't take long at all.
Oh, my.
they've changed the codes.
but you can crack it, right?
you need to get us out of here.
Yeah, of course I can. Just give me about one ... two seconds.
so I guess that frozen Replicator plan didn't pan out?
Yeah, not so much.
how's that Plan B working for ya? Good?
actually, it's more like Plan C.
C as in C4, if you catch my drift.
no.
let's just say that we're concerned the Daedalus won't be able to carry out your standing orders.
What?!
to destroy Atlantis with nuclear weapons? I thought we were past that!
why are we going back to that?
Yeah, it's the only way.
can you do that?
that way when the Replicators try to activate the shield ...
the C4 detonates, the Daedalus beams a warhead into the city and we all get vapourised
sounds more like a Plan F, doesn't it?
as in, "We are totally ..."
if we can fight our way back to the Bay then we'll be able tofly the Jumper to a safe distance.
that is, if we can get the underwater Bay door open.
you can't even open this door!
Hey, I'm workin' in it!
yes
I see that.
we got company.
sorry, sir, we're gonna have to come back for you.
No-no-no-no-no-no, we can't leave them here. They know too much.
What'd you tell 'em?
uh, uh, I mean, they guessed most of it.
what, and you filled in the rest?!
I thought I would have time to get them out of here!
iust forget what I said.
Sheppard, get out of here while you still can.
that's an order.
sorry it has to be this way.
Yeah, I get it. Go.
so ...
we're back to being vapourised.
what is it, Chief?
we're receiving a subspace data burst via midway in the alpha Site.
Daedalus is holding station at their failsafe point and awaiting your order.
reply to Colonel Caldwell that General O'Neill's order stands.
Atlantis is to be destroyed at all costs.
Yes, sir.
done ...
and done.
good
we are well ahead of schedule.
perfect
now let's find some place out of the way and wait for this thing to be over.
come on.
one more to go.
almost done.
we haven't run into a single Replicator.
I know. It's weird.
woolsey and O'Neill said that there were hundreds of them.
where are they?
let's go.
that should do it.
one more to go ...
... and it's all over but the crying.
hopefully them, not us.
what the hell?
no wonder they weren't coming after us.
they've been busy repairing the city.
what is that?
they brought their ZedPMs to power the stardrive.
so that sound is the city about to take off
time to start crying.
they'll still have to activate the shield to take off, won't they?
we got most of their emitters.
Yeah, "most" ain't gonna cut it.
for this plan to work, it is all or nothing.
what do they want to fly around for?
maybe they wanna fly home, back to their homeworld.
and take on the Daedalus.
how are we gonna stop 'em?
well, I ...
drones
they fired drones at us.
that means the Chair is active and powered.
you wanna fire drones at the city?!
we're nowhere near the Chair!
but Teyla and Beckett are.
you want me to do what?!
just do what I say.
alright, I'll give it a try.
but no apologies if I happen to destroy the entire bloody city.
Stardrive, Carson. Concentrate on the stardrive.
right
and, Teyla, you may have to fight your way in.
I'm ready, Colonel.
use your ARG sparingly.
they may build up an immunity.
you may have to go to Plan ... B.
which one's that, again?
never mind. Just go.
clear
thank you, dear.
hurry
they've taken out the guards in the Chair Room.
what are they doing?
they've hit the stardrive.
a search and destroy team is on their way to the Chair Room now
make sure they understand we need them alive.
OK, lads easy
easy
and I was so sure we were gonna survive this one.
me too.
move
bring the prisoners from the other cell.
everyone OK?
so far.
I'll be fine.
why aren't we dead yet?
probably saving us for a little recreational mind-probing.
did everyone get the ...?
we completed our task.
so did we ... in the nick of time.
you?
Yeah. Just under the wire.
did you really think you'd be able to stop us?
well, of course we did.
why else would we be here?
Colonel?
am I gonna have to fire you?
no, sir.
I think you'll have that to look forward to when we get back.
I'm afraid your plan has been discovered, Colonel Sheppard.
it is over.
he put his hand in my forehead
how can you resist that?
well, I like to close my eyes and think of England.
mr Woolsey informed us of everything we need to know.
all of your C4 has been removed from the emitters.
I'm afraid they won't be destroyed when the Daedalus arrives which should be in any moment.
your plan has failed.
the Daedalus is approaching the planet.
as expected.
activate the shield.
C4. How much do we have?
a bunch. Why?
well, it's desperate ...
well, so are we.
we need to split into groups.
I was gonna suggest that anyway.
Why? What are you thinking?
if we're gonna destroy these guys using Replicator disruptors we have to hit them all at once
we'll probably only get a dozen or so shots off before they manage to figure out the frequency.
so, what, you gonna get 'em all to stand in one place at the same time?
clever, yes ...
or we could figure out a way to send one massive blast through the city.
follow me.
Atlantis has ten of these emitters with which it creates the city's shields.
so ...
if we can interface the crystals from the disrupter weapons ...
with those of the shield emitters we should be able to trigger a massive anti- Replicator wave throughout the city.
OK, that's where splitting into teams comes in.
exactly. Now I need to show you how to do this, so listen carefully
you slide out the crystal tray take the crystal from the Replicator weapon you place it in the third slot from the right
third symbol from the left activates the crystal tray.
clear on that?
great.
they are bound to find one of our groups working on the shield emitters.
I already thought of that. That's what the C4's for.
we blow them up?
no. We feed them misinformation.
alright
once you guys have made all your alterations avoid using your shiny new toys even if that means getting caught
OK?
if we plant charges in all ten of the shield emitters before the Daedalus arrives that way when the Replicators try to activate the shield ...
the C4 detonates the Daedalus beams a warhead into the city and we all get vapourised
sounds more like a Plan F, doesn't it?
general O'Neill didn't buy it but I think Woolsey did.
well, I did win a serious drama festival award when I was a kid.
could have made it a career if I wanted to.
wish you would've.
we need to get to the shield emitter stations.
remove the C4 explosive you find there.
way to resist.
I said I wasn't good at this.
the Daedalus is approaching the planet.
as expected
activate the shield
it worked!
I can't believe it worked!
amazing.
well, it was a group effort.
good old Plan D works every time
you guys stay here a sec.
excuse me but what just happened?
we turned the shield into a giant Replicator weapon.
I knew that!
you knew?
well, I've seen Carter crack enough codes to know that McKay was faking the door thing.
he was?
I bought it completely.
I believe that was the point.
wait a minute ? you ...
you used me?
you're alive and you're welcome.
Hey, we're clear.
OK, we've gotta get to the Control Room and contact the Daedalus.
you see, Richard?
you were good for something.
Thanks.
sir. I have an incoming message from Atlantis.
Atlantis? Is it Replicators?
no, sir.
it has Colonel Sheppard's authentication code.
open a channel.
Colonel, I'd like to believe this is you.
well, it is.
authentication code Alpha Delta Charlie Niner Six.
that code is no longer valid, Colonel.
Hey, Caldwell.
general Jack O'Neill here.
that valid enough for you?
you may have been compromised, sir.
we're lowering the city's shields, Steven.
you can send a team to come check us out if you need to.
we'll explain everything.
get a team of marines ready to beam down.
sir.
should be an interesting explanation.
gettin' all settled in?
easily although their decorating?
little bit spartan for my liking.
but the Replicators did do a fine job on rebuilding Stargate Operations back to its original state.
how about yourself?
do you check out OK?
apparently I don't have any little tiny robots floating in my bloodstream which is always nice to hear.
huh! That it is.
so what now?
Oh, a Jumper ride home to the SGC followed by a hot shower, followed by a hot toddy, - followed by ... - I was thinking a little more selfishly.
what are the chances of my team staying here in Atlantis?
Elizabeth, if it were up to me ... - It is up to you.
right
you can stay.
Really?
you're probably still gonna have to get the rubber stamp from the IOA but since you saved Woolsey's ass and you did a fair job on mine
I don't think that'll be a problem.
well, I think I speak for all of us when I say thank you very much.
Hey, you came back to rescue me.
Yes, we did.
of course, next time, consider bringing Carter with you.
welcome home.
it drove my father nuts.
for me, it was my brother only we hadn't lights.
he used to leave candles burning everywhere.
Yeah, well, you know what?
no-one wants to hear any more stories about how poor you were as a child, alright?
we already feel as sorry for you as is humanly possible.
he burned the house down, you know?
my sister was afraid of the dark, only used to blame me for leaving the lights on.
of course, my father believed her.
he never sided with me.
we had to live in a tent in the dead of winter for three months.
you know, at least my stories relate to what we're doing.
so do mine.
you know, we're trekking all over the city shutting down everything the Ancients activated while they were oh-so-briefly in control so that we can stop the power from draining from our one precious ZedPM.
how does that relate to your idiot brother burning the house down?
well, if we don't succeed ...
we're not gonna have to live in a tent in the dead of winter!
it's a metaphor.
doctor McKay.
thank God.
the control panel.
it's completely shot.
Really? You think so?
you know, I don't get these Ancients.
they're supposed to be so smart, but why activate something that you don't need and you're not using, huh?
well, maybe they didn't have time to get to it
you know, before the human-form Replicators that you reprogrammed attacked.
Yes, yes, we all know what happened.
Ah.
you're just angry that you couldn't figure out how to override the Ancient protocols that kept us from shutting this place down remotely from the Control Room.
Hey, neither could you.
Yes, but I didn't bet everyone a month's pay that I could do it.
you ...
OK, you know what?
look around, see if you can figure out how you can turn this place off, whatever it is.
are you sure you should be going up there?
how else am I gonna find out what this room does, huh?
God forbid there should be anything in the Ancient database.
Oh, there probably is. We just don't have the time to ...
Ah, here we go.
OK, there should be a main power switch ...
Yes, I know that. What do you think I'm doing?
alright - double or nothing.
Oh, you're on.
alright!
alright. It's gotta be around here somewhere.
what happened?
I'm not sure ...
but I think I just lost big time.
as far as I can tell, he's fine.
I was hit by a mysterious energy pulse.
how can that possibly be fine?
I've run every test I can:
blood work, MRIs, X-rays, the lot.
I found no anomalies in any of the results.
one more time: mysterious energy pulse from a device created by the Ancients.
I mean, who knows what kind of long-term effects I could be in for?
I mean, there's gross mutation, giantism, invisibility ...
that would be cool. I turned into a bug.
alright. Like I said, as far as I can tell, he's as healthy as a horse.
I'm clearing you for active duty.
are you insane?!
look, I need to be put under guard.
who knows what I could become?
what are the chances it could make him more pleasant?
Oh, thank you!
I'll keep an eye on him.
thank you!
can you still see me?
what are you saying?
that you were showing off.
normally, if Doctor Esposito weren't around,
I doubt you would have been as reckless as you were.
are you insane?
which one's Esposito?
Oh, the long dark hair.
Ah, right.
the one with the perfect little, uh ...
do you mind? We're trying to work here.
for the record, I was gonna say "smile.
Yeah, sure you were. What've you got?
nothing.
whatever you did fried all the power conduits leading into the room.
whatever I did?!
look up until very recently this lab was entirely under water quite possibly for over ten thousand years.
how is that my fault?
well, that part of it isn't.
OK, that's it. I'm going for lunch.
how's he doing?
same old Rodney.
you're sure?
he looks a couple of pounds heavier to me.
what?
he eats all the time.
it's not like he exercises.
he's feeding his unhappiness.
Hello?!
I'm right here. I can ...
I can hear you.
for your information,
I am exactly the same weight I have been since I got here.
I need to eat regularly, otherwise I become hypoglycaemic;
and I am generally a very happy person.
Colonel Sheppard. Please have your team report to the Control Room immediately.
Colonel Sheppard.
we received this transmission six minutes ago from Major Lorne's team.
Atlantis base repeat: we are under attack and cut off from the Gate.
I counted at least twenty, maybe more.
request backup immediately.
where are they?
have a team of marines meet us in the Jumper Bay.
doctor Weir.
any word?
not yet.
it has only been an hour.
you wanted to see me?
Yes. I could use your help.
I managed to get power to part of the console to access the lab's research logs.
well, that's good news.
well, I'm not so sure. I could use a second opinion.
it seems much of this refers to different elements of human physiology.
it mentions the mutation of base genetic coding.
I realise Doctor Beckett said that there were no evident effects from Rodney's exposure to the device.
it seems... meant to manipulate human DNA.
doctor Weir to the Jumper Bay.
the rescue team has returned.
let's go.
what else could it be?!
you're losing your mind!
I'm telling you, it's a bit of a coincidence!
well, then, prove it!
Colonel?
everyone's present and accounted for.
how bad is it and who's been hurt?
no-one, Doc. We're all fine ...
thanks to McKay.
so he says.
well, to be honest, I'm not entirely sure.
I wasn't even sure it was me at first, but the correlation's impossible to ignore.
I saw Lorne's team pinned down, the bad guys closing in
I just thought, you know, wouldn't it be great if all their weapons jammed at the same time?
OK
next thing I know, they're all running away, so ...
so you think because you wanted it to happen, it just did.
it was a little more than that.
OK. You know what?
watch this.
I'll, uh ...
believe me, I find this as disturbing as you do.
like bloody hell you do!
put him down.
Oh, God!
have there been any other instances of this power manifesting itself?
powers. Plural.
what else can you do besides telekinesis?
well, super-hearing for one and I'm not sure but I think I may actually be getting smarter.
it's hard to say for sure because I was pretty smart to start with but, um, recently I've been having some ideas that I don't think even I would have thought of before.
does super-ego count as a power?
Oh! Finally!
look, keep it coming.
we could also be dealing with a super- appetite, although it's hard to tell because he ate so much before.
very funny.
my God! He's eatin' again!
I have a very active metabolism.
aye - among other things.
the scans show a dramatic increase in synaptic interaction throughout all the sections of Rodney's brain - much higher than normal human levels.
there was an incident at SGC just over a year ago.
I recall that file.
I studied the data.
fascinating.
sg-1 discovered a highly-evolved human being in stasis.
it turned out he was a result of experimentation by a Goa'uld named Anubis.
he was trying to create a means of artificially accelerating human physiology to the point of ascension.
look, that device I found must have been some kind of an accelerator.
we know that the Ancients developed all kinds of powers as they evolved, so it's just a matter of bad luck that we didn't run into that lab earlier.
seriously
me a superhero.
who would have thought it?
look, we all agree the Ancients were pretty screwed up.
we do?
all the ones I met were arrogant, condescending - and not for good reason.
they made giant mistakes and never fixed 'em.
they were still human.
but then there were all those crazy rules.
those only came after they ascended.
whatever, alright?
maybe this thing doesn't work on everyone.
who knows? But we do know it works on McKay.
it has only been a day.
assuming it's safe well, to be honest, even if it's not if we can get a significant advantage over the Wraith and Replicators ...
John, I agree - this device may have great potential.
and with great potential comes great responsibility - I know.
like a lot of other things we have found in this city, it is a very advanced piece of technology.
for all we know, it could also be very dangerous.
I'm just saying ...
Yes, you can be next.
thank you!
you know, if you're compiling a list, I'd ...
could we stay focused, please?
right
C'mon. You can't keep me cooped up in here forever.
you might not be sick, Rodney, but I think we can both agree what's happening here is far from normal.
exactly, so let me go out and start using my powers to do some good.
Ooh. Are you going to, uh, finish that?
I'm serious!
we have no idea of the extent of your genetic mutation.
please. "Mutation" has such negative connotations.
Advancement" is more like it.
until we know exactly what's going on here ...
Carson. I'm still me.
anyway, it's not like you ...or these guys could stop me from leaving anyways.
no, but I could.
Oh, you care to put that to a test?
do you?
well ... no, not really.
anyways, as I was saying,
I think you're fine to go about your daily duties as long as you have someone with you ... ... and you ...
check in every couple of hours.
Yes, yes. Bye-bye!
you know, we could be a team.
you could be my sidekick.
sidekick.
yeah - it'd be like Batman and Ronon.
has a nice ring to it.
Yeah, you keep eating like that, it's more like Fatman.
I'm warning you
you will probably be bored out of your mind unless you find incredibly advanced physics to be ...
Really?
what?
what, you think so?
Hey, she thinks I'm hot!
I didn't say anything.
no-no-no, I'm sure that you, uh ...
Oh, of course not, I should have known.
she meant you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
McKay, she didn't say a word.
Oh my God. I can read minds.
Oh, this is cool!
no it isn't.
Oh, I'm fine.
no, yes, and it doesn't.
what? - I can read your mind - uh, everyone's, actually.
that was very cool for the first, like, ten seconds there, but now I'm finding it a little disturbing, so I'm trying to tune it out as much as I possibly can ...
well, sort of. Anyways, look, I wanted to get your permission to access the Control Chair
I've got some pretty interesting ideas for maximising our ZedPM.
I reconfigured the city's power systems it's too complicated to explain - but trust me when I say that you are going to be incredibly happy with the results.
look, Elizabeth,
I know - you have every right not to trust me but
I promise you, I'm gonna make things much, much better, OK?
good. She wants you to shoot me.
if you think for even one second that I might be trying to take over the city for my own evil purposes.
I'm kidding. That was a joke.
is your weapon set to, uh, stun?
wait - never mind. There - I did it myself.
OK, to the Chair Room, Ronon.
can I shoot him now?
I can hear you!
look, she just wants you to keep a close eye on me!
C'mon, let's go. Chop, chop - much to do.
I will send a science team down to supervise.
not like that, this is crap.
what the hell is he doing?
don't ask me.
actually, I wasn't.
I have no idea.
Rodney, you are affecting power all over the city.
I know. Awesome, isn't it?
no.
I can't work.
it's just temporary.
Rodney, I'm trying to determine if that device did any permanent damage to you.
quite frankly, given your usually rampant hypochondria,
I'm surprised you don't seem to care.
you're jealous.
that is ridiculous.
you should be working with me trying to figure out what is happening to you.
instead, you're here burying your head in the sand.
that is not true.
my head - which happens to be housing my ever-evolving brain
is actually being better utilised here doing important things that will affect everybody.
I am not gonna work with him.
I can stand this. He is ...
he tries to hide it, but deep down,
I'm the wind beneath his wings.
well, how's it coming?
actually, I think I'm just getting to the good bit.
don't you hate it when people interrupt right when things are getting good?
I know McKay is some super-genius now, but
I find the flickering lights incredibly unnerving.
doctor Coleman
however reluctantly - admitted it does seem as if Rodney is significantly improving the city's power system.
whatever.
anyway, you were saying ...?
well we know the Ancients evolved physiologically to a certain point where they could transform into a state of pure energy.
ancient History 101.
Yes. We also know that not all of them managed to get there.
you're saying some of them needed a kick in the pants.
so to speak.
I think this machine was not meant to help them fight the war against the Wraith but rather to help them escape it.
an ascension machine?
like the one the Goa'uld tried to create in the Milky Way.
are you saying McKay's going to ascend?
unfortunately there's a whole lot more to ascension than just being physically evolved.
believe me, after spending six months with a bunch of pansy wannabes, I know!
but what does this mean for McKay?
like I said, just gettin' to the good bit.
I'll leave you to it.
John, wait.
we need to talk to Rodney right away.
you can all relax.
I'll have us back online in two minutes.
we need to talk to you.
what do you mean, I'm gonna die?
I'm not even sick! I feel great - never better!
that Ancient device has accelerated my evolution.
eventually I'll reach a point where I'm physically capable of ascension, but ascension takes more than that - there's a ... there's a mental component.
I need to know how to make it happen ... which I don't.
yet!
I'm getting smarter by the minute.
it's a pretty good assumption I'll be able to figure it out on the way.
OK, so it's not as easy as that.
well, even if I don't, so I stay a highly-evolved human.
I mean, I don't have to ascend - it's, it's a choice, right?
no? What do you mean, no?
Oh, that stupid Ancient device doesn't work properly, does it?
it's set in motion a series of genetic mutations that will result in my death if I don't ascend?!
there is something easier about this.
that's why the Ancients didn't put it into common use
it's just one more in a long line of abysmal, over-ambitious failures!
Oh God.
I'm a dead man!
doctor McKay.
Yes, yes
it's because I stopped in the middle. I will fix it - just give me a second here.
that's it.
I will kill him, he is nuts, complete idiot.
OK, there's still time left, right, so maybe there's a way to reverse the process. Zelenka!
Where's Zelenka? What the hell has he been doing?
we have massive power surges throughout the grid.
shutdown protocols are not responding.
dammit!
come on, Radek, come on.
he's not breathing - we need to intubate.
start an IV, wide open.
get that monitor set up.
right - on my count. One, two, three.
get the leads set up, please.
he's in V-tach. Prepare to de-fib.
clear. - No!
Rodney, the man is dying.
I know. Just give me a second. I know.
heart rate's good;
breathing's steady.
pulse is good.
are you OK?
what happened?
hold on.
I see you've been busy.
Yeah, I invented a new math.
Really?!
it's gonna change the human understanding of the universe as we know it.
how is Zelenka?
uh you need to ask?
I'm blocking out people's thoughts.
it was becoming too overwhelming. I wasn't able to think.
I know what you're gonna say.
Oh, no ... just intuition, I swear.
I just ...
I tried to fix the Ancient device but it wasn't meant to reverse the process.
once the mutation has started, it cannot be stopped.
actually
I was gonna say, if you want any help in understanding ascension ...
Oh.
uh well, I've already read everything I could in the database.
well, it's not exactly a clear-cut set of instructions, is it?
no.
and to be honest, you know,
I've never been all that big on the whole idea of ascending in the first place.
there's too many rules, you know?
I mean , to me, life is about working towards achievement, you know? Discovering things ...
... getting credit for it ... - Exactly.
I mean, once you know it all, what do you do then?
I don't know.
I don't think that ascension necessarily means the end.
Yeah, see? Never been big on leaps of faith, either.
I mean, sure, there was a part of me that from the beginning knew that this was too good to be true.
nothing this great could ever happen to me without really, really bad consequences.
anyways now I have come to terms with that and I just wanna get as much done in the time I have left and not waste my time on a bunch of mumbo jumbo I'm not gonna understand anyways.
Oh, I've come up with a way for increasing the Daedalus' shield power.
tell Hermiod to give me a call if he needs any help understanding the base code.
I'm sure Colonel Caldwell will be thrilled.
look, Rodney , I'm not gonna try to convince you that ascension is right for you, or even possible, for that matter. I don't know.
but
I wonder if you have considered the fact that if you did somehow manage to ascend, you can always
theoretically - re-take human form.
why didn't I think of that?
I don't think it's gonna work.
I had this shipped from the SGC.
aye, I know. The Ancient device used to measure a person's synaptic activity.
Ah, more than that - the brain's evolutionary level.
look, it's basically an ascendo-meter.
I really don't think we're going about this the right way.
if you're a highly-evolved super-genius, put up your hand.
Oh!
from everything I read about the subject area ...
look, when you get down to it, even mental states are actually only physical states, are they not?
I mean, the brain is just a chemical supercomputer.
well, I suppose an incredibly complex ...
"yes" is all you need to say, my friend.
look, the universe may seem mystical to ...
those without understanding ...
when in truth anything and everything can be quantified.
look, all the hocus pocus stuff is just a way of getting the brain into the proper electro-chemical state to allow the final physical evolution, at which point the matter that makes up this body will turn into pure energy.
look what mere mortals would refer to as the ... mystery of ascension is actually just a scientific process it's just protons and electrons.
protons and electrons.
if you say so.
now, if you don't mind, can we, uh ...
now based on what I've extrapolated from the Ancient research,
I have been able to set measurable parameters for achieving the proper mental state.
once I reach ninety six percent synaptic connection, as measured by this device ...
all I need to do is maintain an EEG frequency of zero point one to zero point nine Hertz and presto.
I arise to a higher plane of existence.
OK, let's assume for one completely insane moment that you are right.
those frequencies are associated with near-comatose patients.
no-one who's actually awake can just will themselves anywhere close to that, no matter how bloody relaxed they are.
no unevolved person.
give it a rest, Rodney.
just turn it on.
your synaptic activity's abnormally high.
over sixty percent.
Yes! I don't have much time left.
as I said, by my calculations, when I reach ninety six percent,
I either ascend or die.
now, what's my EEG?
twenty nine Hertz, which is about average for someone in an extremely heightened wakeful state.
OK, so I just need to, uh, clear my mind and, um, relax.
what's that now?
What?! Oh, come on, that's impossible! You must have me hooked up wrong.
no I didn't, thank you very much.
we're getting a clear reading.
the Ancients that eventually learned to ascend dedicated their entire lives preparing for this moment.
trust me, this will work. I just need some more time.
now stop talking so much.
you're rippling my pond.
I think he's having a hard time accepting this can't be solved with science, no matter how brilliant he is.
you know what he needs?
he needs to release his burden.
Yeah, well, you know McKay.
maybe Doctor Heightmeyer can help.
actually, I was thinking more along the lines of you.
me?
Mmm-hmm.
you lived with the Ancients for six months on the brink of ascension.
you helped them face their fears and finally ascend.
I fought a scary monster - that's what I do best.
and for Rodney,
I'm sure this seems like a pretty scary monster.
I don't think this is gonna work with you hooked up to the machine.
how else am I gonna know if it's working at all?
look, you're teaching me how to meditate.
not exactly good odds there to start with.
I realise that.
truth is, I was never really very good at this myself.
so why am I here?
Elizabeth made me.
Oh. Yeah. Me too.
I was with those Ancients for six months.
maybe I picked up something that might be able to help you.
yeah
the first thing I think you need to come to terms with is, this is not a means to an end.
what?
well, of course it is.
no, no, no, you can't do that. You can't think that you're just gonna ascend and then re-take human form and be done with it all.
that is exactly what I'm trying to do.
look, from what I understand, dishonesty's not gonna help the process.
good point.
you know, while we're at it, my knees are killing me.
how's anyone ever relax like this?
find a position that works.
right. OK.
fine
now
I want you to become aware of your breaths, going in and out of your body.
in ...
and out.
do it without talking.
Oh - right.
now
I want you to think about the things that you worry about the most.
you mean, like death?
there's no talking.
think of anything that makes you anxious.
Oh, God, there's so many things.
not talking happens to be one of them, by the way.
deal with it.
now.
imagine yourself sitting on a Ferris wheel.
What?!
look, I told you, I didn't pay much attention to what the Ancients were teaching me.
I like Ferris wheels, so that's what I thought about ...
and the fact that the woman teaching me how to meditate was ... very attractive.
why am I not surprised you didn't ascend, huh?
OK, look,
I'm a busy man, you're a busy man. We're both busy men.
just ... relax, alright?
I'm gonna try to remember what the woman taught me.
alright.
now
there's a dark storm swirling around your head.
how is that comforting?
I'm getting there.
I just thought of a brilliant adjunct to the Chaos Theory.
look, I should write this down ... - McKay.
letting it go. Letting it go.
now, the sky is clearing.
all of your troubles are fading away.
bright blue sky. I am there.
How'm I doing?
don't think that way!
Oh, forget it.
look, this is never gonna work.
what's wrong now?
I just realised why light behaves as both particles and waves.
Rodney, if you don't try to do this ...
I know.
I don't have much time left.
Hey.
hmm? Just a second.
what are you doing?
there are, like, fifty simulations I'd like to be running right now, but the computers can't keep up with me the irony being that I've actually figured out how to make them run ten times faster but I haven't had time to actually stop and do it.
Oh,
I've uploaded the virtual prototype for a hyperspace generator for the Puddle Jumpers into the database.
well, that sounds great.
are you sure that this is how you want to ...
spend my last couple of days alive?
don't have a lot of choice, do I?
Rodney, I think it's very decent and noble of you to want to leave a scientific contribution behind but I still believe there's a chance you can ascend if you put your mind to it.
we both know that that is a waste of time.
maybe you could do it, but ...
I don't know if I could, but you are certainly selling yourself short by not even trying.
to be honest,
I don't have the first clue where to start.
stop thinking.
see, I don't understand that.
one of the biggest things that holds people back is that somewhere deep down they believe they're not deserving.
you have to release your burden.
Oh, please!
I know
spirituality to you is a load of mumbo jumbo but it does help people find peace with themselves.
but you have to believe.
I'm not talking about religion.
I'm talking about shedding yourself of guilt, of anger, of ill-feeling, of anything that makes you feel shame.
and then you can focus all of your energy on ascending.
so what you're telling me is that I don't think I'm worthy.
I don't know what you truly believe about yourself.
for all I know you use your intelligence to compensate to make yourself feel better for other things you think you may lack.
like what?
that, I can't tell you ...
but maybe you could start reading your own mind?
Rodney, I don't care what you're gonna say.
I'm gonna keep working on this, OK?
Ah, well,
I appreciate that.
you saved my life, so ...
the least I can do is try to save yours, you know?
I think it's safe to say that,
I am at times a petty, vindictive, even jealous man.
I sublimate my own anxieties or feelings of inadequacy by creating a bubble of hostility around myself.
I know that you, probably more than anyone else, have had to bear the brunt of that hostility.
Rodney, you don't have to ...
actually, I do.
here's the thing:
you're a brilliant scientist, and a decent human being, and you should not have had to endure the kind of abuse that you've taken from me in the past few years.
I hope you can find a way to forgive me for all the things I've said and done to you.
you deserve much better than that ...
so I wanted you to know that.
Yes.
hmm. Mind if I come in?
should you be ...? - Hope you don't mind.
I was talking with Halling and he happened to mention that it was the anniversary of the death of your father next week.
he did?
I might have asked a few pointed questions but, um,
I just thought it would be nice if, uh ...
what I mean is,
I would be honoured if you would let me share the memorial tea ceremony with you.
I don't know if it's wrong to do it early or anything, but, um
I may not be around next week.
anyway
I understand it's something you're not supposed to do alone.
thank you, Rodney.
no, no, no, no, no.
I know exactly what to do.
you are the one who's lost a loved one.
I will serve you.
Hey, buddy!
been looking all over for you!
checked the gym, the Mess.
wasn't there.
no, you weren't. Usually one of those is a good bet.
so, where are you off to?
shooting range?
a little target practice?
I don't need practice.
Oh, no.
no, no, of course you don't.
look
I don't know how much time I have left so I'm just gonna cut to the chase here ask you a rather, uh, personal question.
hopefully you won't just hit me in the face.
asking away.
those scars on your back from your encounters with the Wraith - you know, with the tracking device?
are those, like, a ...
a badge of honour for you, or are they just a constant reminder of something you'd rather forget?
I mean, I know it's none of my business. I just ...
I try not to let things I can't change bother me.
that's very healthy.
I hope you don't mind.
I just healed them.
you're not still trying to find a way out of this for me, are you?
you think I'm gonna give up?
look, all the Ancients that experimented with that device, they either ascended or died most of them the latter, which is why it did not get put into common use.
like you said, there were exceptions.
Yes, well, this will all be over soon and you can get back to some real work.
Rodney ... don't.
no-no-no, I'm not fishing for sympathy. I just, uh ...
Hey, I just wanted to give you that.
what have you invented now?
Oh, nothing. It's a ... it's a book.
about what?
you.
well, you've taken a lot of crap as the leader of this expedition and I just thought someone should leave a record of all the good things you've done everything you've done right.
everything I do is on record for review.
Oh, yes, I know, I know. I just thought that
I would have somewhat of a unique perspective that other people might benefit from.
you know, I actually took the liberty of doing some research into your past and I included that as well.
sorry if I'm not a very good writer.
it might be a bit, uh, overly maudlin in places ...
Rodney, this is five hundred pages long. When did you...?
anyway, that's all.
right.
what's it down to?
it's not important.
what?
of course it is.
it's gotta ...
what - seventeen Hertz?
it's not even close!
it's closer than you've ever been.
Oh, forget it.
look, if you have to keep asking, you're obviously not getting it.
this is about letting go.
I don't know how to do that, OK?
I'm me - I don't know how not to be me.
look, thank you for all of your help.
I think in the grand scheme of things, we're ...
we're good, aren't we?
of course.
right. Look, if it's not too much trouble, I'd like you to read my eulogy.
I refuse to discuss that.
just keep it simple.
um, make up a few nice things.
I'd like my little sister to be there ...
... and oh, you should know that I told Beckett that he should most definitely do a full autopsy.
he can use my body for any kind of experimentation that might prove helpful, and, uh ...
Oh, and I'd like to be cremated, with my ashes to be, uh ...
thrown out into space from the Jumper ...
medical team to my quarters.
the synaptic activity in your brain has reached over ninety percent.
I don't know why, but it seems the more pervasive evolved state of the cortex is causing lapses in the lower brain function.
it's almost as if your body's losing its natural ability to keep itself alive.
when ascension occurs naturally, the physical body's no longer necessary in the final stages.
Rodney, I don't know how much more you can take.
about six percent?
there must be something we can do.
it's OK.
you know,
I'm actually feeling a sense of peace ...
interspersed with moments of sheer terror, of course.
as far as this ascension thing,
I know you didn't have much success but at this point, what've you got to lose?
may as well go out fighting, huh?
Absolutely.
hook me up.
thank you.
thank you for everything.
I only wish I could have done more, my friend.
clear blue skies.
all my troubles, just drifting away.
stop talking now.
Rodney, you're a good person.
know that we love you.
you love me?
Really?
all of you?
in a way a friend feels about another friend.
you're just saying that because I'm gonna die.
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm gonna die.
alright - just back to the blue skies. Let your thoughts go.
concentrate on your breathing.
Oh, my God.
he's not breathing.
quick, bag him. We need to get him on a ventilator.
Carson, he gave us strict orders ...
you don't understand.
he just told me how to save him.
we're en route. His pulse is very weak. Are you ready?
we will be.
almost.
right.
hurry. He can't breathe on his own.
OK, stand back.
it worked!
did it?
well, I'm alive, aren't I?
sounds like him.
yes
I can't hear one of your thoughts.
the telekinesis has gone.
I'm still smart, I think ...
Yes!
Yes, I'm me!
I'm my old self!
are you certain?
Yeah, I'm alive! I feel great!
I feel, uh ...
um ... Hungry?
he's fine.
and you said it was impossible.
Yeah, it just came to me.
I was, I was, I was floating in this, this big black emptiness and then the answer just came out of nowhere.
look, the device was designed to manipulate your DNA.
it couldn't reverse the evolutionary advancement process because everyone's DNA was different.
it makes certain changes that causes the DNA to evolve in ways specific to your own unique physiology.
Yeah. In order to manipulate the DNA back to the previous state the programme required a precise reference point.
fortunately I keep blood samples from all the Atlantis team members for baseline comparisons.
I don't understand what any of you are talking about.
what - what?
it's good to have you back, buddy.
Yes, well - it's good to be back.
Yeah!
Hey, how are you feeling?
terrible!
should I get Carson?
no-no-no-no-no. Physically I am fine, but this doesn't make any sense.
I can't figure out any of these, of these equations.
I mean, the algorithms are complete gibberish. I mean, this is torture!
I can clearly remember exactly how important this all is, but I cannot figure out why, or how.
well, I just dropped by to show you this.
your EEG readings from your last meditation.
Oh, my God!
it's point zero three Hertz.
I did it!
I mean, I was in the zone! I could have actually ascended!
you said you were floating in a big empty space when the idea of how to save yourself came to you.
I may have momentarily thought about how hard it is to rid oneself of ego and that existence without the individuality of consciousness would be pointless but ...
Ooh!
now I say that, that's probably what gave me the idea to reprogramme the device with my old DNA.
Yeah, I thought so.
Yeah, well, you know what?
I don't care if you don't think I was capable of ascension.
I never wanted to do it anyways.
in fact, you know what? I am very happy with who I am.
and you love me.
What?!
I never ... - You so did!
Yeah, I may not be able to understand this new math I created, but I distinctly remember that you said you love me.
actually, I said we love you and ...
and, what?
what, you were just saying that because you thought I was dying?
no - I said it because ...
see?! You love me! It's true - you've said it, now I know. I always suspected it.
in fact, you know what? I've always noticed that there's been a, um, indefinable and yet magical chemistry between us ...
that I think I covered in Chapter ten.
you had lunch yet?
Yes.
mid-afternoon snack, then?
I will keep you company.
now, is Sheppard still bugging you to let him use the ascension device to turn himself into some kind of a superhero?
Oh yes.
despite the fact that the Ancient database states that its effects on people are wildly unpredictable and that I'm just lucky I wasn't instantly melted down into a pool of protoplasm.
Yes.
Yes. Well, maybe you should let him.
I think not.
let me ask you a question.
say there's a runaway train.
it's hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of the tracks.
the only way to save those people is to flip a switch - send the train down another set of tracks.
the only problem is there is a baby in the middle of those tracks.
why would anyone leave a baby in harm's way like that?
I don't know. That's not the point.
look, it's an ethical dilemma.
look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night.
the question is:
is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one baby to save the ten people?
wouldn't the people just see the train coming and move?
no. No, they wouldn't see it.
why not?
well ... ... Look, I dunno - say they're blind.
all of them? - Yes, all of them.
then why don't you just call out and tell them to move out of the way?
well, because they can't hear you.
what, they're deaf too?
how fast is the train going?
look, the speed doesn't matter!
well, sure it does.
if it's goin' slow enough, you could outrun it and shove everyone to the side.
or better yet, go get the baby.
for God's sake! I was just trying to ...
Yes. Go ahead.
major Lorne just dialled in from M4D-058.
he says he's got something you'll want to see.
work it out.
we came through the space Gate and immediately noticed a bunch of small satellites in geosynchronous orbit above the planet.
an advanced civilisation?
that's what we thought, then we picked up life signs directly below, so we flew down, saw several villages separated by a large river and decided to check one of them out, and as you can see ... Sergeant?
these people don't exactly look like they're ready to be launching any satellites
at least not for the next five hundred years or so.
the Ancients probably put 'em up there.
send a science team to check it out.
uh, actually,
I think Doctor McKay may wanna come check this one out for himself.
Why?
take a look.
how the hell did your face get on that flag?
uh, I don't know.
here's the thing, though:
that flag's very similar to the one I designed in our game.
it's exactly like the one you designed in our game.
what game?
the game Rodney and I have been playing.
we didn't tell you about the game?
we've been playing for a while now.
Yeah, off and on in our spare time, you know.
at night, between missions, uh ...
I could have sworn we told you about it?
what game?
well, it started a while ago ...
a few months after we arrived here.
we were exploring the city, checking out some labs on the east pier when we discovered a room.
there were several ancient consoles and screens
it was quite an impressive layout.
as usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we entered.
at first we thought it was some kind of a geological facility ...
there was a screen with a map that we assumed was of the Lantean mainland.
Yes, I remember you briefing me about that.
right! There you go! We did tell you!
you mentioned nothing about a game, though.
because at first we didn't know what it was ...
then Rodney studied it more closely.
he realised it wasn't a geological lab at all.
no, it turns out it was, in fact, a kind of, uh, ancient game room.
the map was of a fictional civilisation as part of a simulated world.
sweet!
Yeah, what you do is, you'd take these countries that are already in the database and you'd assume control of them.
two societies separated by a river straight down the middle.
Sheppard took one country; I took the other.
first thing Rodney did was started by renaming his country and putting his face all over the flag.
I think you need to check this planet out.
so the ancestors created this game?
Yes, but this is no ordinary game.
I mean, it is incredibly challenging, instructional ...
I mean, the sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.
how does one play it?
you have to figure out the best way to run your country.
Yeah, you build roads, you establish laws moulded to your own specific ideology ...
you can control everything:
proper sanitation systems with water delivery ...
... transportation ...
I mean, every detail can be manipulated
I mean, right down to the women's hairstyles.
hello there!
so how do you win this game?
it's not really about winning.
it's more about whose society outshines the other's.
I mean, who creates a better infrastructure, who's better at trade.
what?
Hey, don't start. I tried to negotiate with you.
making a list of demands and not giving anything in return is not negotiating.
I offered you an entire crop of beans.
I don't need beans. I need lumber.
Oh, right
to build defensive fortifications for your army, which he doubled in size, by the way.
surprise, surprise.
I only did that after you started cheating.
I did not cheat.
he's giving his people way too much technology for their level of development.
I'm not the only one increasing my army, by the way.
I had to do something to protect the people of Geldar from you.
the name of Rodney's country.
he named it after a girl he stalked in college.
I did not stalk her.
we dated twice.
Teresa Geldar - a very cute blonde.
I always used to think her name reminded me of some kind of a mythological land.
the Kingdom of Geldar.
what did you call your country?
well, I just kept the name it already had.
well, there are the satellites.
dozens of them.
positioned directly above the continent.
a perfect grid - ten by ten.
should have a visual on one of them.
definitely looks ancient.
huh. And active.
it's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.
alright - let's check it out.
this is amazing!
if you say so.
that's something you see in a medieval village!
Yes, well, the Renaissance obviously came early to these folks.
a couple of hundred years early?
um, Rodney?
say something.
like what?
I don't know!
hello.
I am Nola.
Yes, well, uh, this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm
doctor Rodney McKay.
the resemblance is uncanny.
you are the Oracle.
the Oracle?
welcome to Geldar.
please forgive my nervousness.
I never thought you'd appear to us in the flesh.
why do you refer to him as the Oracle?
the Oracle is a wise and omnipotent deity.
boy, she's in for a rude awakening.
thousands of years ago he gave our ancestors life.
he instructed them how to build their society, how to live their lives. His guidance was revered by all.
then one day without warning, the Oracle ceased all communications.
war with the Wraith.
our people were puzzled by this but they continued to adhere to his instructions, living their lives according to his teachings which they passed down from generation to generation.
have you not had any trouble with the Wraith?
Yes.
they've come periodically
culled our people, destroyed our villages.
those who survived rebuilt, but only to the level at which the Oracle had instructed before he left.
we found ourselves stalled in our development, unwilling to push forward without the Oracle's guidance, hoping one day he would return to us.
and two years ago, he did.
the Oracle resumed communicating with us, teaching us many new things.
he challenged us to think
to push the limit of our scientific endeavours.
he changed the name of our country and even revealed his likeness to us.
enough with the pictures!
and you communicate through that.
the portal, yes.
it's through this that we receive our instructions.
and the Oracle knows when you have carried them out?
Yes.
it's the satellites.
they must be tracking everything that's going on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis.
it's remarkable.
so, not a game after all.
no, it's obviously some kind of ancient experiment
social development try out different ways to create civilisations.
this country here.
a persistent thorn in our side.
now that you've come to us, you can help us remove it.
so this is it?
Yes, yes. It is an amazing piece of technology.
it appears to be a sociological experiment designed by the ancients to help them as they were seeding various civilisations throughout Pegasus.
I've had a chance to look at it further and it's interesting:
there are many more civilisations in the game's database.
Really?
I thought Rodney said there were only two.
that's what he thought.
the actual countries that he and Colonel Sheppard are controlling are on this specific planet but I've been able to access the codes to unlock additional levels to the game ...
I mean, to the experiment.
I discovered countries on planets throughout the galaxy.
some have been idle for the past ten thousand years
I guess awaiting instructions from the ancients
but some have managed to develop on their own even flourish.
some have been destroyed by war and others have been completely wiped out.
not that Rodney's and Colonel Sheppard's societies are on this path.
so much power at one's fingertips.
it's amazing the attraction of this ... game.
we've managed to achieve propulsion through hand-powered propellers, but now we're undertaking tests of steam-powered propulsion.
only this morning I completed a test that proved quite promising.
Really? That's great.
you're pleased?
yes yes. I mean, this is quite an achievement.
what's he doing here?
it wasn't my idea.
doctor Rodney McKay, meet Baden.
Oh.
your guy.
my guy.
Yeah, it figures.
I should have you arrested for trespassing.
go ahead and try.
easy now.
I brought him here because we need to have a little discussion.
I have nothing to say to him.
fine with me.
Yeah, maybe not ...
... but we definitely have something to say to you.
so his story's pretty much the same as Nola's.
his ancestors received instructions from their Oracle who disappeared for thousands of years, only to suddenly resume communicating a few years ago.
let me guess: he told you to double the size of your army.
Yes, he has a capable army.
and some nice villages.
no people riding bicycles or hot air balloons, because we weren't cheating.
I didn't cheat!
have you come to agree to our trade proposals?
you mean demands?
never.
then I refuse to sit at the same table ...
look, please, just - just sit.
thank you.
this hostility between you
have your people lived like this for thousands of years?
no.
there was once peace between our lands.
Oh no.
so this hostility - um, did it start a few years ago?
Yes, shortly after the Oracle resumed communicating with us.
so what, they're starving?
well, not as of yet, but if they don't change their approach to agriculture, it won't be too long before many of their people go hungry.
the frustrating thing is that there is a large piece of fertile soil in the south of the country that would be ideal for tuber cultivation, you know?
sorry, tuber?
tuber, yeah, tuber. It is indigenous to the planet.
it's a ... it's like a potato.
so why didn't you say potato?
because it's not a potato.
it's - it's larger.
it has the same texture and nutrients as a potato but it's a ... ... like a cantaloupe.
that's a pretty big potato.
Yeah, it is a big potato.
so if they plant this thing there, it'll grow?
Yeah, oh yes, whole fields of it.
I mean, they could sustain an entire village
but they're oblivious to it.
tell them.
anonymously.
Oh, c'mon, Doc, you can either stand here and let the people die, or you can help 'em out.
sounds like a no-brainer to me.
as soon as we input the instructions into our console they are relayed back to this device by a number of satellites in orbit over your planet.
once you've carried out the instructions the satellites transmit their real-time results back to us on our homeworld.
so you're saying this is a game?
no, no ... I mean, we thought it was a game, but, uh ...
we didn't know there were real people on the other end.
you are the Oracle?
I'm your Oracle, yes.
that doesn't sound right.
I know this is difficult to absorb, but it is all true.
you flew in the Puddle Jumper.
you know they have the technology.
I'm not listening to this.
just hold on here a sec. We can prove it to you.
how?
let's go for a ride.
baden, Nola, this is Doctor Weir, leader of our expedition.
welcome to Atlantis.
if these two gentlemen haven't done so already, let me please offer you our sincerest apologies for this intrusion into your lives.
intrusion?
an imposition, maybe, and a benevolent one at that.
I mean, if you could have seen the villages now - compared to the way they were when we started ... - Rodney.
now, why don't you take them to your game room show them what you two have been up to?
right.
shall we?
so, this is Geldar and this is Hallona.
look, two weeks ago I instructed you to start digging a well for the new settlement on the eastern slope and on here ...
there. See?
construction's already begun.
Yes.
I gave the order myself.
our lives are just a game.
well, now, no.
they're not games to you and in our defence, we were trying to improve your lives.
it's like he said: everything we did, every instruction we gave was to better conditions for your people.
and if that meant cheating ...
OK, you know, enough with that already!
is the room OK?
it's fine.
well, then, if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask, OK?
you hungry?
cause we could walk across to the Mess Hall.
they've got, um, I think it's, uh, Salisbury steak today.
it's very good. They have a gravy that they put on the ...
steak part and, uh ...
the Oracle was a god to us.
I believed in his teachings, so much so that my people elected me leader because of my passion for scientific advancement.
they obviously made the right choice.
now I must resolve myself to the fact that the Oracle is only a man.
Yeah.
sorry about that.
it's like I said, though
I did what I did with the best of intentions.
to win a game.
no. No, no.
it is not about winning or losing.
look, the information I gave you and your people is very real very useful.
I've set you on a course that will allow you to develop into a modern society.
I mean, what were you two years ago?
you were a primitive, disparate cluster of villages stalled in development.
now you're making dirigibles.
do you have any idea how momentous that is?
the Oracle once said, Ask not what Geldar can do for you, but what you can do for Geldar.
those were your words.
um, give or take.
they are very wise.
Yes.
Yes, they are.
well, now that you know the truth, you can go back to living your own lives.
we won't bother you any more.
no.
you must still help us.
you don't need our help. You'll be fine.
we need more weapons.
the flying machine you brought us here in you called it a Puddle Jumper.
our army could use it.
no.
can't do that.
but you encouraged me to increase the military.
in response to McKay the other Oracle doing things that I thought were, uh ...
aggressive?
arrogant?
demeaning to me and my people?
I will give you arrogant and demeaning, but ...
the people of Geldar have started digging a mine beneath our borders to exploit coal resources on our land.
Really?
it was only confirmed yesterday.
this after several diplomatic attempts to reach a compromise.
Yeah, we couldn't come to an agreement but
I didn't think he would start digging.
I'm curious to know what response you would have to such an incursion.
I believe your next command would be to launch an attack on the mine, prevent them from digging further.
I'm right, aren't I?
did they believe you?
Yes. They are fully aware of the situation.
not too thrilled, obviously.
we've got a big problem, though.
what is it?
game or no game, the fact remains we've started something these people don't seem to wanna stop.
they hate each other and may be headed for a very real war.
great
great and this is thanks to your "benevolent imposition"?
I've asked you both here this morning so we can have a face to face talk.
now, hopefully, I can help you reach an understanding.
Where's Doctor McKay?
well, I've asked that neither he nor Colonel Sheppard participate in this.
I think they've already done enough in fostering the current tension between you.
now, I have had some experience brokering peace treaties.
I'm sure we can find some common ground.
why don't we start by going back a few years, to the time when your two peoples lived in peace?
we were naive back then
ignorant to our potential.
once we began to challenge ourselves intellectually, we began to see
I've done everything I could to achieve peace with you.
Really?!
such as?
I sent gifts of goodwill.
you sent crates of citrus fruit!
Citrus!
do you have any idea what an insult that is to my people?!
it didn't used to be.
OK, see, I think I know where that comes from.
did M... the Oracle tell you that citrus fruit was bad?
he made us aware of its toxic properties, yes.
everything is toxic to you!
if they're not busy insulting us, they're complaining about contaminated food improper hygiene.
even the sunlight is dangerous to them!
the only insult has been your unwillingness to compromise in any trade negotiation.
instead, you choose to increase the size of your army.
you built an army too!
only in response to your aggression.
my aggression?
you dig a mine beneath our border to steal our coal and you have the nerve to talk about aggression!
we're not stealing your coal. - You crossed into our land!
what do you need it for anyway?
it's not like you know the first thing about what to do with it.
you see how she insults us?
by stating a fact.
please
if we can discuss this reasonably,
I am sure we can come to some sort of ...
we've tried.
they agree to nothing.
and until Doctor McKay is brought into this discussion,
I have nothing further to say.
that went well.
talk to them.
get them back to the table and hammer out a truce.
I have run into a roadblock.
Really? Nola seemed very agreeable.
to you.
Yeah, well, more agreeable than Richard the Lionheart.
they are both refusing to compromise.
you seem to have convinced them that they can't make any decisions without your guidance.
that's not true.
tell them that.
this is delicious!
listen, you need to make peace with the people of Hallona.
if tensions keep rising like this, it could lead to war.
I'm aware of that.
well, then, you're also aware that people will get hurt.
I know the danger to my people.
I also know you've taught us things
Baden's band of knuckle-draggers won't learn for hundreds of years.
under your leadership, we hope to remain many steps ahead of any kind of aggression from them.
you and your people need to start thinking for yourselves.
look, I'm not gonna be there for you any more.
you need to take control of your own lives, start making your own decisions about your future.
and there can be no future without peace.
I agree.
good.
and as soon as the people of Hallona either concede or get out of our way, peace will be restored.
what you told me before
I do realise how monumental our progress has been, and I refuse to let Baden destroy that.
great spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre minds.
those are the words of the Oracle.
your words.
Einstein's, actually, but, um ...
if we yield one bit to Hallona, it will be equal to taking a giant step back in our development.
I owe it to my people to make sure that does not happen.
they're digging further.
every hour they intrude deeper into our land.
to get them to stop, you have to provide an incentive.
like attacking the mine?
that'll cause a whole 'nother set of problems.
the only problems will be with the people of Geldar.
not necessarily. They can fight back.
what are you saying - we should capitulate, let them do whatever they want?
no. You make a deal, trade - say, you decide to share some of your weaponry and they in turn give you some of their technology.
go ahead.
how's it going?
well he's being a little, uh ...
stubborn?
I was gonna use a different word.
I'd like you to come to my office. We need to talk.
they're not open to any kind of deal?
not yet.
maybe we should stick 'em in a room, force 'em to come to an agreement.
don't worry about it. They'll work it out.
look, we just happened to catch them at a particularly bad time.
Sheppard's guy's been doing a lot of aggressive posturing of late.
the only aggression is coming from the people of Gelding.
whatever
his people are digging a mine across the border into Hallona.
the coal resources straddle the border between my country and his.
barely! They go three miles into my country which your people are happily tunnelling into.
it has been a point of contention between us,
OK, but it is just a difference in cartographic interpretation.
Tomayto. Tomahto.
no, no, it's pretty clear cut.
you entered illegally into my country.
gentlemen.
you gave me no choice! You refused to negotiate!
you mean give in.
what do you care anyway? It's not like your people were gonna use the coal!
Oh, yeah, that's right.
you need it to power your medieval steam engines.
stop it.
these are not your lands.
this "game" is over, so you'd better set aside your differences because if the two of you can't figure out how to forge a truce, how the hell are these people going to?
what?
you'd better come to the Game Room.
what happened?
we've just received a data stream from the planet.
Colonel Sheppard's army has launched an attack.
don't look at me. I didn't order it.
they're going after the mine!
looks like your war just started.
who ordered this?
I did.
he entered the command on your game console.
I only did it because I know it's something you would have told me to do.
I wanted you to make peace with these people!
this attack will not go unpunished.
no-one is doing any punishing.
there'll be no further escalation to this conflict.
there's no casualties reported.
looks like the mine was surrendered without a fight.
I told my army to minimise collateral damage.
you need to get back there.
take Ronon and Teyla with you.
go to your respective countries and make sure this does not get any further out of hand.
no-one has been hurt yet.
let's keep it that way.
you're back.
we were beginning to worry.
what's the status?
I've ordered three army units to re-take the mine.
they're on their way.
Oh no.
No-no-no. You need to put a stop to that.
Why?
look, we just need to step back and re-assess the situation here,
OK? We should be thinking about easing tensions, not inflaming them.
Oh no.
they're continuing to advance.
What?!
divert the units away from the mine.
have them gather in the village, prepare to defend it.
isn't this what she's supposed to be stopping?
Yes. Look, listen to me. You cannot engage them.
we must protect our people.
look, I agree, but you've gotta give Sheppard some time.
he'll call off the army.
will he?
Sheppard. Come in.
go ahead.
are you watching what's going on here?
we just got here.
pretty much the same set-up as yours.
we don't have electricity, but I'm not gonna get into that right now.
your army is still on the march.
What?!
they're headed for one of my villages. You need to call them off before they ...
the attack has begun.
looks like you guys are giving up.
what? No-no-no-no, that can't be right.
that was fast, Rodney.
they retreated without any kind of a fight.
what kind of an army is that?
well, at least there's no casualties.
it's alright.
I have another plan.
what other plan?
why are you asking me?
uh, what are you doing?
preparing our counter-attack.
what counter-attack?
from information you gave us about high-temperature and energetic materials technology,
I have constructed a tactical explosive device.
a bomb? You actually built a bomb?
I told you we'd always be several steps ahead of Baden.
how come I didn't know about this?
we have yet to test it, so it still appears to not exist.
we will target one of Hallona's outlying villages.
how are you even gonna deliver it?
I mean, the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.
I will deliver it.
using one of the airships you taught us to build. Go.
Oh, no.
no-no-no-no-no. Come back!
you taught them how to build a bomb?!
No!
well, not specifically.
look, OK, maybe I provided them with a list of ingredients but ...
I don't believe this!
how much damage can it cause?
enough to take out an entire village.
well, then, you must tell them to stop.
I tried that, but it's already on the way!
how are they delivering it?
dirigible.
you just had to cheat, didn't you?
I did not cheat.
look, nowhere in the rules did it specifically outlaw the development of flying machines - only the degree and speed of technological advancement.
well, they advanced pretty damned fast, didn't they?
do we still have time to shoot it down?
Yes. Yes, I think so.
then we'd better get moving.
absurd!
what are you talking about?
it's a perfectly reasonable request!
Oh yeah. Perfectly reasonable
I give you all of my food and my people starve.
I am not asking you for all of your food!
plus I did say that we would make a deal.
a deal. Oh yeah. Baskets.
big baskets!
two dozen of 'em, hand-woven and very nice.
Oh, very nice. What am I gonna put in them, huh?
certainly not food!
I think you're holding out on me.
I think you have plenty of food.
are you calling me a liar?!
no, I think you're trying to squeeze me for a better deal, that's what I think.
I have got nothing to hide!
now, if you're ... - OK, OK so maybe I'll send some of my army troops down and we'll have a look!
what the hell are you two doing?
I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from this device.
Yes, yes, you did.
we just saw that there were some people in trouble and we thought that maybe that we could ...
um ... help.
No!
no more help.
clearly we are not qualified.
now turn this thing off, disconnect the power and seal the room.
but, OK, we ... - Now.
Yes.
I hoped you would be proud of our accomplishments.
I am, really. I just ...
I wish it didn't lead to this.
what's that?
there it is.
good. Now all you have to do is puncture the balloon.
already on it.
Colonel Sheppard!
he shot down our airship with the Puddle Jumper!
well, don't worry. No-one was hurt.
he just ... he punctured it. It sank harmlessly to the ground.
prepare the other bombs for delivery.
other bombs? - What, you have more?!
great
thank you for your help.
you saved the lives of everyone in that village.
we won't be doing that again.
I had no idea they were capable of delivering such a device.
tell me about it!
I've issued orders to make certain they don't try again.
what kind of orders?
a full-scale attack has been launched.
it's time to finish this war.
I've seen this before.
if two sides are dead set on fighting, nothing's gonna stop them.
so I've gotta get Nola to call off the attack.
you couldn't do it before. What makes you think you can now?
how about a little encouragement, huh?
you know, "Go get 'em, Rodney. I have faith in you"?
OK, whatever.
look, I am not giving up on these people, which means until we get them to call this war off, then we are staying put right here.
we could use your help. Come on.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, what's going on?
Elizabeth diverted the Daedalus on its way back to Earth to check up on us.
Colonel Caldwell believed that the situation had deteriorated.
he feared that we would become casualties of war and so beamed us out.
Yeah, but I talked him into beaming us back, but we've gotta do something first, so come on.
do what?
I've got a plan.
Oh, what plan?
Oh, come on, already.
how's the situation on your end?
all-out war. You?
where did you go? What happened?
uh, nowhere, nowhere. We were just upstairs.
someone said you vanished into thin air.
What?! No, that's ridiculous. How could we vanish?
the airships have passed the southern forest.
they're nearing their targets.
let's hope we strike first before Baden's army reaches our villages.
we'll destroy their will to fight.
listen to me.
for two years now I have been the Oracle to your people.
I have given you much wisdom and guidance and bestowed much of my knowledge.
look, it's like you said:
I was a god.
easy.
and yes, yes, I may just be a man, but that wisdom still remains.
and now, more than ever, you need to heed my guidance and call back those ships.
you told me it was time to start thinking on my own.
right.
so now I am.
my people are looking to me.
this is my decision and we will be victorious.
why won't you help us?
I'm not shooting down any more ships.
we're done helping you wage this war.
then we'll shoot them down ourselves.
how?
our weapons are not as primitive as Nola believes.
many people will die on both sides.
if you want to leave, then leave.
we'll continue this fight even if you've lost the will.
you're making a big mistake.
the only mistake was not doing this sooner.
you'll see.
this is the right path for my people.
they've reached our villages.
two have already fallen.
the airships are almost in position. We should ...
what happened?
they shot down one of your ships.
it wasn't the Puddle Jumper.
maybe one of the catapults hit it.
no, impossible!
two more villages have fallen. It appears many are dead.
come in. ... Sheppard!
the radio's dead.
they're coming here.
what, they have bombs too?!
we need to get your people out of here now.
help them.
their army has surrounded us.
the road out of the village is blocked.
people are being slaughtered as they try to leave.
we're trapped.
what shall we do?
it's over.
Rodney, where the hell are you?
they've dropped another bomb.
hundreds are dying! How can you stand by and let this happen?
Nola's army has surrounded the village.
we'll get to the Jumper.
they just destroyed it.
we're being overwhelmed.
what should we do?
game over.
Rodney, you there?
Yeah. We hear you.
we'll give you a call when we're ready to be picked up.
got it.
I don't understand.
what's going on?
what you just witnessed is what I would call another level to the game.
see, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the Daedalus in orbit over your planet.
while we were there, I had Doctor McKay hack into the two devices, upload doomsday scenarios for each of your countries into the game.
everything you saw just now was transmitted from the Daedalus.
you mean none of this was real?
no-one was hurt.
no-one was killed.
all just part of the simulation.
in reality, your two armies are standing down awaiting further instructions.
but we heard explosions. We felt them.
thanks to some pinpoint shots from our friends in the Daedalus.
it really added to the realism, didn't it?
I'm sorry that we had to do that but you needed to see how this could end.
feel what a real war is like.
you still think it was the right path for your people?
gentlemen.
how's it going?
Ah, it's still going.
we're just taking a break.
there's a lot of animosity to be unravelled but I think they are finally willing to at least try to make it work.
well, it's about time.
Yeah.
and you two?
called a truce yet?
Yeah, sure. We're good.
Yeah, don't worry. We're gonna stick to chess from now on.
as long as Rodney doesn't cheat.
Oh, please, like I need to cheat playing you?
OK, I'll leave you to it, then.
checkmate
What?!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no. What happened there?
what happened there is I just kicked your ass.
no, no, I was distracted.
she was, uh ... OK, we're going again.
best of ten.
let me ask you a question.
say there's a runaway train.
it's hurtling out of control towards ten people standing in the middle of the tracks.
the only way to save those people is to flip a switch - send the train down another set of tracks.
the only problem is there is a baby in the middle of those tracks.
why would anyone leave a baby in harm's way like that?
I don't know. That's not the point.
look, it's an ethical dilemma.
look, Katie Brown brought it up over dinner the other night.
the question is:
is it appropriate to divert the train and kill the one baby to save the ten people?
wouldn't the people just see the train coming and move?
no. No, they wouldn't see it.
why not?
well ... ... Look, I dunno - say they're blind.
all of them? - Yes, all of them.
then why don't you just call out and tell them to move out of the way?
well, because they can't hear you.
what, they're deaf too?
how fast is the train going?
look, the speed doesn't matter!
well, sure it does.
if it's goin' slow enough, you could outrun it and shove everyone to the side.
or better yet, go get the baby.
for God's sake! I was just trying to ...
Yes. Go ahead.
major Lorne just dialled in from M4D-058.
he says he's got something you'll want to see.
work it out.
we came through the space Gate and immediately noticed a bunch of small satellites in geosynchronous orbit above the planet.
an advanced civilisation?
that's what we thought, then we picked up life signs directly below, so we flew down, saw several villages separated by a large river and decided to check one of them out, and as you can see ... Sergeant?
these people don't exactly look like they're ready to be launching any satellites
at least not for the next five hundred years or so.
the Ancients probably put 'em up there.
send a science team to check it out.
uh, actually,
I think Doctor McKay may wanna come check this one out for himself.
Why?
take a look.
how the hell did your face get on that flag?
uh, I don't know.
here's the thing, though:
that flag's very similar to the one I designed in our game.
it's exactly like the one you designed in our game.
what game?
the game Rodney and I have been playing.
we didn't tell you about the game?
we've been playing for a while now.
Yeah, off and on in our spare time, you know.
at night, between missions, uh ...
I could have sworn we told you about it?
what game?
well, it started a while ago ...
a few months after we arrived here.
we were exploring the city, checking out some labs on the east pier when we discovered a room.
there were several ancient consoles and screens
it was quite an impressive layout.
as usual, everything sprang to life as soon as we entered.
at first we thought it was some kind of a geological facility ...
there was a screen with a map that we assumed was of the Lantean mainland.
Yes, I remember you briefing me about that.
right! There you go! We did tell you!
you mentioned nothing about a game, though.
because at first we didn't know what it was ...
then Rodney studied it more closely.
he realised it wasn't a geological lab at all.
no, it turns out it was, in fact, a kind of, uh, ancient game room.
the map was of a fictional civilisation as part of a simulated world.
sweet!
Yeah, what you do is, you'd take these countries that are already in the database and you'd assume control of them.
two societies separated by a river straight down the middle.
Sheppard took one country; I took the other.
first thing Rodney did was started by renaming his country and putting his face all over the flag.
I think you need to check this planet out.
so the ancestors created this game?
Yes, but this is no ordinary game.
I mean, it is incredibly challenging, instructional ...
I mean, the sheer number of options built into it? Staggering.
how does one play it?
you have to figure out the best way to run your country.
Yeah, you build roads, you establish laws moulded to your own specific ideology ...
you can control everything:
proper sanitation systems with water delivery ...
... transportation ...
I mean, every detail can be manipulated
I mean, right down to the women's hairstyles.
hello there!
so how do you win this game?
it's not really about winning.
it's more about whose society outshines the other's.
I mean, who creates a better infrastructure, who's better at trade.
what?
Hey, don't start. I tried to negotiate with you.
making a list of demands and not giving anything in return is not negotiating.
I offered you an entire crop of beans.
I don't need beans. I need lumber.
Oh, right
to build defensive fortifications for your army, which he doubled in size, by the way.
surprise, surprise.
I only did that after you started cheating.
I did not cheat.
he's giving his people way too much technology for their level of development.
I'm not the only one increasing my army, by the way.
I had to do something to protect the people of Geldar from you.
the name of Rodney's country.
he named it after a girl he stalked in college.
I did not stalk her.
we dated twice.
Teresa Geldar - a very cute blonde.
I always used to think her name reminded me of some kind of a mythological land.
the Kingdom of Geldar.
what did you call your country?
well, I just kept the name it already had.
well, there are the satellites.
dozens of them.
positioned directly above the continent.
a perfect grid - ten by ten.
should have a visual on one of them.
definitely looks ancient.
huh. And active.
it's transmitting a tremendous amount of data.
alright - let's check it out.
this is amazing!
if you say so.
that's something you see in a medieval village!
Yes, well, the Renaissance obviously came early to these folks.
a couple of hundred years early?
um, Rodney?
say something.
like what?
I don't know!
hello.
I am Nola.
Yes, well, uh, this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, Ronon Dex, and I'm
doctor Rodney McKay.
the resemblance is uncanny.
you are the Oracle.
the Oracle?
welcome to Geldar.
please forgive my nervousness.
I never thought you'd appear to us in the flesh.
why do you refer to him as the Oracle?
the Oracle is a wise and omnipotent deity.
boy, she's in for a rude awakening.
thousands of years ago he gave our ancestors life.
he instructed them how to build their society, how to live their lives. His guidance was revered by all.
then one day without warning, the Oracle ceased all communications.
war with the Wraith.
our people were puzzled by this but they continued to adhere to his instructions, living their lives according to his teachings which they passed down from generation to generation.
have you not had any trouble with the Wraith?
Yes.
they've come periodically
culled our people, destroyed our villages.
those who survived rebuilt, but only to the level at which the Oracle had instructed before he left.
we found ourselves stalled in our development, unwilling to push forward without the Oracle's guidance, hoping one day he would return to us.
and two years ago, he did.
the Oracle resumed communicating with us, teaching us many new things.
he challenged us to think
to push the limit of our scientific endeavours.
he changed the name of our country and even revealed his likeness to us.
enough with the pictures!
and you communicate through that.
the portal, yes.
it's through this that we receive our instructions.
and the Oracle knows when you have carried them out?
Yes.
it's the satellites.
they must be tracking everything that's going on and then relaying it via subspace back to Atlantis.
it's remarkable.
so, not a game after all.
no, it's obviously some kind of ancient experiment
social development try out different ways to create civilisations.
this country here.
a persistent thorn in our side.
now that you've come to us, you can help us remove it.
so this is it?
Yes, yes. It is an amazing piece of technology.
it appears to be a sociological experiment designed by the ancients to help them as they were seeding various civilisations throughout Pegasus.
I've had a chance to look at it further and it's interesting:
there are many more civilisations in the game's database.
Really?
I thought Rodney said there were only two.
that's what he thought.
the actual countries that he and Colonel Sheppard are controlling are on this specific planet but I've been able to access the codes to unlock additional levels to the game ...
I mean, to the experiment.
I discovered countries on planets throughout the galaxy.
some have been idle for the past ten thousand years
I guess awaiting instructions from the ancients
but some have managed to develop on their own even flourish.
some have been destroyed by war and others have been completely wiped out.
not that Rodney's and Colonel Sheppard's societies are on this path.
so much power at one's fingertips.
it's amazing the attraction of this ... game.
we've managed to achieve propulsion through hand-powered propellers, but now we're undertaking tests of steam-powered propulsion.
only this morning I completed a test that proved quite promising.
Really? That's great.
you're pleased?
yes yes. I mean, this is quite an achievement.
what's he doing here?
it wasn't my idea.
doctor Rodney McKay, meet Baden.
Oh.
your guy.
my guy.
Yeah, it figures.
I should have you arrested for trespassing.
go ahead and try.
easy now.
I brought him here because we need to have a little discussion.
I have nothing to say to him.
fine with me.
Yeah, maybe not ...
... but we definitely have something to say to you.
so his story's pretty much the same as Nola's.
his ancestors received instructions from their Oracle who disappeared for thousands of years, only to suddenly resume communicating a few years ago.
let me guess: he told you to double the size of your army.
Yes, he has a capable army.
and some nice villages.
no people riding bicycles or hot air balloons, because we weren't cheating.
I didn't cheat!
have you come to agree to our trade proposals?
you mean demands?
never.
then I refuse to sit at the same table ...
look, please, just - just sit.
thank you.
this hostility between you
have your people lived like this for thousands of years?
no.
there was once peace between our lands.
Oh no.
so this hostility - um, did it start a few years ago?
Yes, shortly after the Oracle resumed communicating with us.
so what, they're starving?
well, not as of yet, but if they don't change their approach to agriculture, it won't be too long before many of their people go hungry.
the frustrating thing is that there is a large piece of fertile soil in the south of the country that would be ideal for tuber cultivation, you know?
sorry, tuber?
tuber, yeah, tuber. It is indigenous to the planet.
it's a ... it's like a potato.
so why didn't you say potato?
because it's not a potato.
it's - it's larger.
it has the same texture and nutrients as a potato but it's a ... ... like a cantaloupe.
that's a pretty big potato.
Yeah, it is a big potato.
so if they plant this thing there, it'll grow?
Yeah, oh yes, whole fields of it.
I mean, they could sustain an entire village
but they're oblivious to it.
tell them.
anonymously.
Oh, c'mon, Doc, you can either stand here and let the people die, or you can help 'em out.
sounds like a no-brainer to me.
as soon as we input the instructions into our console they are relayed back to this device by a number of satellites in orbit over your planet.
once you've carried out the instructions the satellites transmit their real-time results back to us on our homeworld.
so you're saying this is a game?
no, no ... I mean, we thought it was a game, but, uh ...
we didn't know there were real people on the other end.
you are the Oracle?
I'm your Oracle, yes.
that doesn't sound right.
I know this is difficult to absorb, but it is all true.
you flew in the Puddle Jumper.
you know they have the technology.
I'm not listening to this.
just hold on here a sec. We can prove it to you.
how?
let's go for a ride.
baden, Nola, this is Doctor Weir, leader of our expedition.
welcome to Atlantis.
if these two gentlemen haven't done so already, let me please offer you our sincerest apologies for this intrusion into your lives.
intrusion?
an imposition, maybe, and a benevolent one at that.
I mean, if you could have seen the villages now - compared to the way they were when we started ... - Rodney.
now, why don't you take them to your game room show them what you two have been up to?
right.
shall we?
so, this is Geldar and this is Hallona.
look, two weeks ago I instructed you to start digging a well for the new settlement on the eastern slope and on here ...
there. See?
construction's already begun.
Yes.
I gave the order myself.
our lives are just a game.
well, now, no.
they're not games to you and in our defence, we were trying to improve your lives.
it's like he said: everything we did, every instruction we gave was to better conditions for your people.
and if that meant cheating ...
OK, you know, enough with that already!
is the room OK?
it's fine.
well, then, if you need anything at all, don't hesitate to ask, OK?
you hungry?
cause we could walk across to the Mess Hall.
they've got, um, I think it's, uh, Salisbury steak today.
it's very good. They have a gravy that they put on the ...
steak part and, uh ...
the Oracle was a god to us.
I believed in his teachings, so much so that my people elected me leader because of my passion for scientific advancement.
they obviously made the right choice.
now I must resolve myself to the fact that the Oracle is only a man.
Yeah.
sorry about that.
it's like I said, though
I did what I did with the best of intentions.
to win a game.
no. No, no.
it is not about winning or losing.
look, the information I gave you and your people is very real very useful.
I've set you on a course that will allow you to develop into a modern society.
I mean, what were you two years ago?
you were a primitive, disparate cluster of villages stalled in development.
now you're making dirigibles.
do you have any idea how momentous that is?
the Oracle once said, Ask not what Geldar can do for you, but what you can do for Geldar.
those were your words.
um, give or take.
they are very wise.
Yes.
Yes, they are.
well, now that you know the truth, you can go back to living your own lives.
we won't bother you any more.
no.
you must still help us.
you don't need our help. You'll be fine.
we need more weapons.
the flying machine you brought us here in you called it a Puddle Jumper.
our army could use it.
no.
can't do that.
but you encouraged me to increase the military.
in response to McKay the other Oracle doing things that I thought were, uh ...
aggressive?
arrogant?
demeaning to me and my people?
I will give you arrogant and demeaning, but ...
the people of Geldar have started digging a mine beneath our borders to exploit coal resources on our land.
Really?
it was only confirmed yesterday.
this after several diplomatic attempts to reach a compromise.
Yeah, we couldn't come to an agreement but
I didn't think he would start digging.
I'm curious to know what response you would have to such an incursion.
I believe your next command would be to launch an attack on the mine, prevent them from digging further.
I'm right, aren't I?
did they believe you?
Yes. They are fully aware of the situation.
not too thrilled, obviously.
we've got a big problem, though.
what is it?
game or no game, the fact remains we've started something these people don't seem to wanna stop.
they hate each other and may be headed for a very real war.
great
great and this is thanks to your "benevolent imposition"?
I've asked you both here this morning so we can have a face to face talk.
now, hopefully, I can help you reach an understanding.
Where's Doctor McKay?
well, I've asked that neither he nor Colonel Sheppard participate in this.
I think they've already done enough in fostering the current tension between you.
now, I have had some experience brokering peace treaties.
I'm sure we can find some common ground.
why don't we start by going back a few years, to the time when your two peoples lived in peace?
we were naive back then
ignorant to our potential.
once we began to challenge ourselves intellectually, we began to see
I've done everything I could to achieve peace with you.
Really?!
such as?
I sent gifts of goodwill.
you sent crates of citrus fruit!
Citrus!
do you have any idea what an insult that is to my people?!
it didn't used to be.
OK, see, I think I know where that comes from.
did M... the Oracle tell you that citrus fruit was bad?
he made us aware of its toxic properties, yes.
everything is toxic to you!
if they're not busy insulting us, they're complaining about contaminated food improper hygiene.
even the sunlight is dangerous to them!
the only insult has been your unwillingness to compromise in any trade negotiation.
instead, you choose to increase the size of your army.
you built an army too!
only in response to your aggression.
my aggression?
you dig a mine beneath our border to steal our coal and you have the nerve to talk about aggression!
we're not stealing your coal. - You crossed into our land!
what do you need it for anyway?
it's not like you know the first thing about what to do with it.
you see how she insults us?
by stating a fact.
please
if we can discuss this reasonably,
I am sure we can come to some sort of ...
we've tried.
they agree to nothing.
and until Doctor McKay is brought into this discussion,
I have nothing further to say.
that went well.
talk to them.
get them back to the table and hammer out a truce.
I have run into a roadblock.
Really? Nola seemed very agreeable.
to you.
Yeah, well, more agreeable than Richard the Lionheart.
they are both refusing to compromise.
you seem to have convinced them that they can't make any decisions without your guidance.
that's not true.
tell them that.
this is delicious!
listen, you need to make peace with the people of Hallona.
if tensions keep rising like this, it could lead to war.
I'm aware of that.
well, then, you're also aware that people will get hurt.
I know the danger to my people.
I also know you've taught us things
Baden's band of knuckle-draggers won't learn for hundreds of years.
under your leadership, we hope to remain many steps ahead of any kind of aggression from them.
you and your people need to start thinking for yourselves.
look, I'm not gonna be there for you any more.
you need to take control of your own lives, start making your own decisions about your future.
and there can be no future without peace.
I agree.
good.
and as soon as the people of Hallona either concede or get out of our way, peace will be restored.
what you told me before
I do realise how monumental our progress has been, and I refuse to let Baden destroy that.
great spirits have always encountered opposition from mediocre minds.
those are the words of the Oracle.
your words.
Einstein's, actually, but, um ...
if we yield one bit to Hallona, it will be equal to taking a giant step back in our development.
I owe it to my people to make sure that does not happen.
they're digging further.
every hour they intrude deeper into our land.
to get them to stop, you have to provide an incentive.
like attacking the mine?
that'll cause a whole 'nother set of problems.
the only problems will be with the people of Geldar.
not necessarily. They can fight back.
what are you saying - we should capitulate, let them do whatever they want?
no. You make a deal, trade - say, you decide to share some of your weaponry and they in turn give you some of their technology.
go ahead.
how's it going?
well he's being a little, uh ...
stubborn?
I was gonna use a different word.
I'd like you to come to my office. We need to talk.
they're not open to any kind of deal?
not yet.
maybe we should stick 'em in a room, force 'em to come to an agreement.
don't worry about it. They'll work it out.
look, we just happened to catch them at a particularly bad time.
Sheppard's guy's been doing a lot of aggressive posturing of late.
the only aggression is coming from the people of Gelding.
whatever
his people are digging a mine across the border into Hallona.
the coal resources straddle the border between my country and his.
barely! They go three miles into my country which your people are happily tunnelling into.
it has been a point of contention between us,
OK, but it is just a difference in cartographic interpretation.
Tomayto. Tomahto.
no, no, it's pretty clear cut.
you entered illegally into my country.
gentlemen.
you gave me no choice! You refused to negotiate!
you mean give in.
what do you care anyway? It's not like your people were gonna use the coal!
Oh, yeah, that's right.
you need it to power your medieval steam engines.
stop it.
these are not your lands.
this "game" is over, so you'd better set aside your differences because if the two of you can't figure out how to forge a truce, how the hell are these people going to?
what?
you'd better come to the Game Room.
what happened?
we've just received a data stream from the planet.
Colonel Sheppard's army has launched an attack.
don't look at me. I didn't order it.
they're going after the mine!
looks like your war just started.
who ordered this?
I did.
he entered the command on your game console.
I only did it because I know it's something you would have told me to do.
I wanted you to make peace with these people!
this attack will not go unpunished.
no-one is doing any punishing.
there'll be no further escalation to this conflict.
there's no casualties reported.
looks like the mine was surrendered without a fight.
I told my army to minimise collateral damage.
you need to get back there.
take Ronon and Teyla with you.
go to your respective countries and make sure this does not get any further out of hand.
no-one has been hurt yet.
let's keep it that way.
you're back.
we were beginning to worry.
what's the status?
I've ordered three army units to re-take the mine.
they're on their way.
Oh no.
No-no-no. You need to put a stop to that.
Why?
look, we just need to step back and re-assess the situation here,
OK? We should be thinking about easing tensions, not inflaming them.
Oh no.
they're continuing to advance.
What?!
divert the units away from the mine.
have them gather in the village, prepare to defend it.
isn't this what she's supposed to be stopping?
Yes. Look, listen to me. You cannot engage them.
we must protect our people.
look, I agree, but you've gotta give Sheppard some time.
he'll call off the army.
will he?
Sheppard. Come in.
go ahead.
are you watching what's going on here?
we just got here.
pretty much the same set-up as yours.
we don't have electricity, but I'm not gonna get into that right now.
your army is still on the march.
What?!
they're headed for one of my villages. You need to call them off before they ...
the attack has begun.
looks like you guys are giving up.
what? No-no-no-no, that can't be right.
that was fast, Rodney.
they retreated without any kind of a fight.
what kind of an army is that?
well, at least there's no casualties.
it's alright.
I have another plan.
what other plan?
why are you asking me?
uh, what are you doing?
preparing our counter-attack.
what counter-attack?
from information you gave us about high-temperature and energetic materials technology,
I have constructed a tactical explosive device.
a bomb? You actually built a bomb?
I told you we'd always be several steps ahead of Baden.
how come I didn't know about this?
we have yet to test it, so it still appears to not exist.
we will target one of Hallona's outlying villages.
how are you even gonna deliver it?
I mean, the catapult couldn't possibly reach that far.
I will deliver it.
using one of the airships you taught us to build. Go.
Oh, no.
no-no-no-no-no. Come back!
you taught them how to build a bomb?!
No!
well, not specifically.
look, OK, maybe I provided them with a list of ingredients but ...
I don't believe this!
how much damage can it cause?
enough to take out an entire village.
well, then, you must tell them to stop.
I tried that, but it's already on the way!
how are they delivering it?
dirigible.
you just had to cheat, didn't you?
I did not cheat.
look, nowhere in the rules did it specifically outlaw the development of flying machines - only the degree and speed of technological advancement.
well, they advanced pretty damned fast, didn't they?
do we still have time to shoot it down?
Yes. Yes, I think so.
then we'd better get moving.
absurd!
what are you talking about?
it's a perfectly reasonable request!
Oh yeah. Perfectly reasonable
I give you all of my food and my people starve.
I am not asking you for all of your food!
plus I did say that we would make a deal.
a deal. Oh yeah. Baskets.
big baskets!
two dozen of 'em, hand-woven and very nice.
Oh, very nice. What am I gonna put in them, huh?
certainly not food!
I think you're holding out on me.
I think you have plenty of food.
are you calling me a liar?!
no, I think you're trying to squeeze me for a better deal, that's what I think.
I have got nothing to hide!
now, if you're ... - OK, OK so maybe I'll send some of my army troops down and we'll have a look!
what the hell are you two doing?
I thought I gave specific orders to stay away from this device.
Yes, yes, you did.
we just saw that there were some people in trouble and we thought that maybe that we could ...
um ... help.
No!
no more help.
clearly we are not qualified.
now turn this thing off, disconnect the power and seal the room.
but, OK, we ... - Now.
Yes.
I hoped you would be proud of our accomplishments.
I am, really. I just ...
I wish it didn't lead to this.
what's that?
there it is.
good. Now all you have to do is puncture the balloon.
already on it.
Colonel Sheppard!
he shot down our airship with the Puddle Jumper!
well, don't worry. No-one was hurt.
he just ... he punctured it. It sank harmlessly to the ground.
prepare the other bombs for delivery.
other bombs? - What, you have more?!
great
thank you for your help.
you saved the lives of everyone in that village.
we won't be doing that again.
I had no idea they were capable of delivering such a device.
tell me about it!
I've issued orders to make certain they don't try again.
what kind of orders?
a full-scale attack has been launched.
it's time to finish this war.
I've seen this before.
if two sides are dead set on fighting, nothing's gonna stop them.
so I've gotta get Nola to call off the attack.
you couldn't do it before. What makes you think you can now?
how about a little encouragement, huh?
you know, "Go get 'em, Rodney. I have faith in you"?
OK, whatever.
look, I am not giving up on these people, which means until we get them to call this war off, then we are staying put right here.
we could use your help. Come on.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, what's going on?
Elizabeth diverted the Daedalus on its way back to Earth to check up on us.
Colonel Caldwell believed that the situation had deteriorated.
he feared that we would become casualties of war and so beamed us out.
Yeah, but I talked him into beaming us back, but we've gotta do something first, so come on.
do what?
I've got a plan.
Oh, what plan?
Oh, come on, already.
how's the situation on your end?
all-out war. You?
where did you go? What happened?
uh, nowhere, nowhere. We were just upstairs.
someone said you vanished into thin air.
What?! No, that's ridiculous. How could we vanish?
the airships have passed the southern forest.
they're nearing their targets.
let's hope we strike first before Baden's army reaches our villages.
we'll destroy their will to fight.
listen to me.
for two years now I have been the Oracle to your people.
I have given you much wisdom and guidance and bestowed much of my knowledge.
look, it's like you said:
I was a god.
easy.
and yes, yes, I may just be a man, but that wisdom still remains.
and now, more than ever, you need to heed my guidance and call back those ships.
you told me it was time to start thinking on my own.
right.
so now I am.
my people are looking to me.
this is my decision and we will be victorious.
why won't you help us?
I'm not shooting down any more ships.
we're done helping you wage this war.
then we'll shoot them down ourselves.
how?
our weapons are not as primitive as Nola believes.
many people will die on both sides.
if you want to leave, then leave.
we'll continue this fight even if you've lost the will.
you're making a big mistake.
the only mistake was not doing this sooner.
you'll see.
this is the right path for my people.
they've reached our villages.
two have already fallen.
the airships are almost in position. We should ...
what happened?
they shot down one of your ships.
it wasn't the Puddle Jumper.
maybe one of the catapults hit it.
no, impossible!
two more villages have fallen. It appears many are dead.
come in. ... Sheppard!
the radio's dead.
they're coming here.
what, they have bombs too?!
we need to get your people out of here now.
help them.
their army has surrounded us.
the road out of the village is blocked.
people are being slaughtered as they try to leave.
we're trapped.
what shall we do?
it's over.
Rodney, where the hell are you?
they've dropped another bomb.
hundreds are dying! How can you stand by and let this happen?
Nola's army has surrounded the village.
we'll get to the Jumper.
they just destroyed it.
we're being overwhelmed.
what should we do?
game over.
Rodney, you there?
Yeah. We hear you.
we'll give you a call when we're ready to be picked up.
got it.
I don't understand.
what's going on?
what you just witnessed is what I would call another level to the game.
see, we were beamed up earlier to our ship, the Daedalus in orbit over your planet.
while we were there, I had Doctor McKay hack into the two devices, upload doomsday scenarios for each of your countries into the game.
everything you saw just now was transmitted from the Daedalus.
you mean none of this was real?
no-one was hurt.
no-one was killed.
all just part of the simulation.
in reality, your two armies are standing down awaiting further instructions.
but we heard explosions. We felt them.
thanks to some pinpoint shots from our friends in the Daedalus.
it really added to the realism, didn't it?
I'm sorry that we had to do that but you needed to see how this could end.
feel what a real war is like.
you still think it was the right path for your people?
gentlemen.
how's it going?
Ah, it's still going.
we're just taking a break.
there's a lot of animosity to be unravelled but I think they are finally willing to at least try to make it work.
well, it's about time.
Yeah.
and you two?
called a truce yet?
Yeah, sure. We're good.
Yeah, don't worry. We're gonna stick to chess from now on.
as long as Rodney doesn't cheat.
Oh, please, like I need to cheat playing you?
OK, I'll leave you to it, then.
checkmate
What?!
Oh, no-no-no-no-no. What happened there?
what happened there is I just kicked your ass.
no, no, I was distracted.
she was, uh ... OK, we're going again.
best of ten.
you have some Wraith DNA
my father told people it was a gift
I could help my people by warning them of the Wraith's approach.
no matter how many Wraith ships be destroyed more can come here.
you're saying you think Teyla might be able to...
tap into this Wraith psychic network?
if she can we'll be able to gather all the intel we ever needed about them.
I would not even consider asking you to do this if I didn't think it could potentially provide us with some vital information.
Dr. Beckett will remain on hand at all times to monitor your physiology.
I am on a ship.
you are all so pathetic.
um ... shotgun ... is it?
Oh, come on.
I don't know why I have to do this.
what?
nobody said anything.
you don't have to, do you?
look, it's not my fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.
Rodney, you said you knew where it was.
I said I knew its last known location.
it is a mobile drilling station, remember?
obviously that's gonna take a few hours.
if we don't find it soon, this is gonna be your last known location.
Oh, zing!
OK, kids.
do I have to pull this thing over?
it's hard enough being in this damned thing for hours without listening to you guys.
actually, Doctor McKay has managed to narrow the search field to a remarkably small area.
Finally! The voice of reason!
thank you, Doctor ... um ...
Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.
uh, I've been here almost eight months.
Really?
Oh.
it's been that long, has it?
time certainly flies.
of course, not sitting in a Jumper looking for a needle in a haystack.
you know what? Shut up!
you know what? You shut up, OK?
Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining!
uh, it's Graydon, with a 'd'.
what?
you sure?
it's my name.
no-no-no, 'cause I could have sworn that the guy I wanted from your department was called Grayson, 'cause I remember thinking Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne's ward.
well, it's Graydon.
perhaps that means I hired the wrong guy.
well, still glad you came?
Oh, sorry. I was preoccupied thinking about the geothermal drilling platform.
shouldn't take us much longer.
we just passed the thermal layer and I'm getting some readings a couple of hundred feet ahead.
if we did manage to find an alternate and potentially limitless power supply that would make even this insufferably long search seem worthwhile.
OK, kids, we're here.
well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to power up the station.
that wasn't so hard.
now all I've gotta do is dock this thing and we can find out what this place is all about.
submersion
all systems are online and functioning at full capacity.
you mean we're generating power already?
well ...
no. No-no, but we probably could if we wanted to.
no, slow down.
the Ancients abandoned this project for a reason.
let's try to find out what that reason might be before we start drilling into the planet's crust.
Yes, well, fair enough.
have we not been down this hallway before?
every corridor looks the same.
don't worry. I have an uncanny sense of direction.
I think she's right.
we've been down this way before.
that's impossible.
we took a left, and a left, and then a right.
Hey, look, all I'm saying is ...
what?
I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.
are you sure?
we're pretty deep underwater.
I cannot be certain, but I believe it is onboard the drilling platform.
this is Sheppard.
everyone drop what you're doing; get back to the Control Room immediately.
we did a complete life signs scan.
it's the first thing we did when we stepped aboard this station.
look, I promise you, there is nobody here but us.
I know, Rodney, but I am sensing it even closer now.
well, maybe it's the pressure.
it's been known to do things to the mind.
just humour me and check again.
there.
all of these life signs have been accounted for.
Humoured?
wraith don't show up on life signs detectors if they're hibernating.
I know what I am sensing.
there is no Wraith here! I'm telling you!
has your sense ever been wrong?
never.
and I cannot shake this feeling.
I trust her.
as opposed to irrefutable fact?
your machines don't know everything.
I never said that they did.
there is a way for me to be sure.
if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link ...
that's a little reckless, don't you think?
if there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind for me to link with and therefore no risk.
but if there is a Wraith nearby ... we need to know.
I am ready.
you sure?
the briefest contact will determine whether or not I'm right.
that's all we need, so don't stick around any longer.
and we will bring you out of it at the first sign of trouble.
just to be sure ...
it's already set to stun.
sorry.
I was mistaken.
there's nothing there.
well, that's good.
I'm sorry.
no reason to be sorry.
perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this depth.
well, if you've ever seen "The Abyss," pressure can make you nuts.
not that I think you're nuts.
it's alright, John.
I am relieved.
so am I.
well, we have a lot of exploring to do.
we?
until Rodney delivers the preliminary status report,
I'm all yours. Put me to work, Colonel.
alright, let's make up some time. Break into teams.
Ronon, you're with Teyla. Elizabeth, you're with me
or I'm with you, however you wanna put it.
either [ee-ther] way ...
or either [eye-ther] way.
that was weird.
well, we are at the very bottom of the ocean.
maybe you're right.
Teyla's just experiencing the effects of the pressure.
hopefully not as bad as that guy in "The Abyss.
this place is big, huh?
what's wrong?
nothing. Why?
you just haven't said a word.
have I not?
no.
has my silence made you uncomfortable?
no.
your friendship is very important to me.
I would hate to do anything that made you ... uncomfortable.
well... good
what's going on?
what do you mean, what's going on?
we just lost the lights.
what?
you're right.
Yes, we can see that!
we just lost power to forty percent of the station.
sensors are currently offline.
Zelenka, what are you doing?
uh, what do you mean, what am I doing?
have you lost power where you are?
no.
have you?
no.
we have.
I wanna know what's going on.
you know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia.
we're bound to blow a few fuses.
look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.
report your position.
Ronon, Teyla? Come in.
Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon and Teyla.
you know their position?
no, negative.
internal sensors are out, but I have determined the location where the power went down.
it's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.
it's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.
we'll meet you there.
it's, uh, Dickenson, sir.
Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here.
look, get back to the Jumper
see if you can use its sensors to determine the location of our people within the drilling platform.
sir.
Graydon, you go with him.
there you are.
weapons fire.
nine mil. This way.
Oh, yes. Let's race towards the gunfire!
Ronon, Teyla, come in.
are you alright?
No!
did you see who attacked you?
Yeah, it was Teyla.
What?! Why?
OK, until we know what's going on,
I'd like everyone in one place.
this is Zelenka.
someone has just activated emergency forcefields throughout the station.
can you make it back to the Control Room?
Yes, I think so.
do it.
that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?
you and Elizabeth go back to the Control Room.
ronon and I are gonna check up on Teyla.
be careful.
no kidding!
drop it.
what the hell's going on?
I do not know.
Rodney, what's the status?
as far from the "quo" as it gets.
look, Teyla didn't just shut down several key systems;
she scrambled the existing operating codes.
this is going to take a while.
can we contact Atlantis?
the station's communication system is just gone.
I can't even patch it. She's blown the control crystals
and shut down half the power to the station and set up a series of emergency forcefields.
to what purpose?
this is Sheppard.
we've got Teyla.
And?
and nothin'.
she has no memory of anything that happened the last hour.
we're on our way to Crew Quarters.
I'll meet you there.
OK, let's forget about restoring the station to its former glory.
concentrate your efforts on internal sensors and disabling the forcefields that are cutting us off from the Jumper.
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.
don't worry about that.
how are you feeling now?
I'm fine but to hear of the damage I caused and yet to have no memory of my actions ...
just tell us what you do remember.
I was attempting to seek out the Wraith presence with my mind and then ...
there is a Wraith?
the most powerful mind I have ever encountered.
I tried to shut her out ...
her?
Yes.
I believe this Wraith is a Queen.
I hate Queens.
in that brief moment, I sensed great power the experiences of many centuries hunger ...
and then nothing
my next memory is of Colonel Sheppard and Ronon aiming their weapons towards me.
so there is a Wraith aboard the drilling platform.
if that were the case why'd she use Teyla to do all that damage and why didn't the life signs detector pick up a signal?
doesn't matter.
if she's here - I'll find her. - We'll find her.
I would like to help.
I'm sorry, Teyla, - but until we can determine exactly what ... - Yes, of course.
I understand.
any progress on disabling those forcefields?
I'm getting indications that some of them are going up and down.
we could really use the Jumper's sensors.
I'm doing my best, sir.
one of these days I'm just going to call him Doctor McCoy.
I'd love to be there for that!
well, the next time he calls me Grayson ...
actually, I know a Grayson.
there really is a Grayson?
Yeah. He's a damned good scientist, too.
I'm surprised McKay didn't hire him.
did you do that?
I don't know but I'm happy to take credit for it.
check it out.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
what could the Wraith possibly want with an Ancient drilling platform?
for that matter, how did they even get here?
maybe on a ship nearby.
underwater?
who knows?
Teyla's spidey-sense works for miles.
look, are the external sensors up and running?
uh, yes, they're operational, but they're designed to scan the ocean floor.
doesn't matter.
take a look at the drilling platform's external sensors see what you turn up.
what am I looking for?
anything.
how are you feeling?
I have never been more ashamed.
Oh, you can't blame yourself.
I should have been more careful.
a Wraith Queen's mind is extremely powerful, Teyla.
you know that better than I do. - Still if my actions while under her control result in people getting hurt ...
if you hadn't done what you did, who knows what could have happened?
at least now we know what we're dealing with.
if anything, I should thank you.
I certainly don't blame you.
I would like to help them find her.
there is no risk.
I don't know that.
unless you suspect I am still under her control even now.
would I be alone with you if I did?
then you think I am somehow vulnerable to her.
I think it is best to keep you away from her for the moment, yes.
look, I don't fully understand this capability you have of linking with a Wraith mind but if it's even remotely possible that ...
she was only able to control me because I opened my mind to her.
if I choose to do so again,
I will be ready.
Teyla, I know you wanna help.
I do.
the best way for you to do that is allow Ronon and Colonel Sheppard to find her.
as you wish.
it's about time.
I was beginning to think you'd gotten lost.
listen, did you manage to, uh ...
Colonel Sheppard!
if you can hear me, please ...
help me!
who am I talking to?
what's your location?
do you have any men unaccounted for?
two guys I just sent back to the Jumper.
I think they're in trouble. Can you get those forcefields down?
we're working on it.
the Wraith presence is even stronger than before.
she is aboard this station. You must warn them.
Colonel Sheppard
Teyla's certain the Wraith is aboard the station.
understood.
Ronon, I'm headin' back to the Jumper. Meet me there.
I'm on my way.
help me! Please!
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Almost there.
I can only do one at a time.
the Jumper's sensors should be able to locate them.
Graydon's dead.
fed upon.
what about Dickenson?
no sign of him yet.
let's see if we can find him using the, uh ...
Sheppard, come in.
you are Sheppard.
the one who can fly this ship.
you will return me to the surface.
kneel.
Sheppard, this is McKay. What've you got?
Sheppard, can you hear me?
is something wrong?
you will fly me to the Stargate and return me to my people.
Sheppard, this is McKay. Please respond.
Sheppard, come in!
I'm here.
we had to throw the emergency forcefields up.
the section you were in was flooding.
I noticed!
see, you were thrown by the force of the water clear of the forcefield bulkhead.
I missed.
I noticed that too!
everyone else is accounted for.
any sign of Dickenson?
stand by, McKay.
look, I don't know what just happened, but we are now cut off from the Jumper.
I won't miss now.
wait!
what for?
well, we lost the Jumper, we lost communications with Atlantis.
maybe she can help us get out of this place.
welcome back.
I trust you're comfortable.
that groggy sensation you're feeling are the sedatives we're pumping you full of.
just a precaution.
as for the other precautions ...
now, you're gonna tell us everything we want to know.
in exchange for ...?
this is not a negotiation.
I disagree.
let me get this over with.
how did you get aboard this station?
are there any more of you?
you are all about to die.
Really?
you care to elaborate on that at all?
we should be able to keep the forcefields up until Atlantis sends a rescue Jumper but station communications are still down, so ...
I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.
don't worry about it, Rodney. It's not your fault.
I'm the one who sent those men back to the Jumper.
well, the sensors indicated that there was nobody here, so ...
I don't think there was, sir.
I think the Wraith arrived here after we did the initial scans.
what?
you asked me to do a search with the remote sensors. I found something.
we didn't notice it on the way down because it's radiating very little E. M.
guys? Head back here.
I think I have a few answers.
a Wraith cruiser.
it's almost completely buried in silt.
which means it's been here a very, very, very long time.
Yes, give or take a very.
that doesn't explain how she got here.
maybe she swam over.
no, no.
the pressure at that depth is ... is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?
Yes, it's difficult to imagine, but with the Wraith's ability to heal itself ...
and there are no other Wraith on board?
no way to know for sure.
our prisoner isn't talking, other than "You're all about to die.
which may or may not be an empty threat.
then you have no way of knowing?
well, she said it with a lot of confidence.
there is a way to find out.
we've already been down that road.
and what is to stop her exerting control over you again?
she's heavily sedated.
and this time I know exactly what I'm dealing with.
you.
I was caught offguard the first time.
that will not happen again.
it does not matter.
well, we think it does.
your fate is sealed.
if you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.
I won't.
I see her ... leading the first wave of ships that attacked Atlantis during the war.
queen of a great alliance.
her ship was damaged during the battle.
it crashed into the ocean.
she fed upon her own crew to survive.
too deep to ever swim to the surface ... waking between centuries ...
waiting for rescue that never came ...
until finally she was alone.
she sensed our presence during our descent.
she sensed ...me and saw us as her one chance of freedom from her prison.
the water was ... crushing but she was determined
finally after all these millennia a ship!
but she did not possess the gene to fly it.
she used Dickenson to call for me.
you are all about to die.
that does not sound like Teyla.
you are all about to die.
you are all about to die.
Teyla, snap out of it!
wait!
she has activated the self-destruct device of the Wraith cruiser.
it is set to detonate within two hours.
so not an empty threat.
how's Teyla?
she's resting.
I think it took a lot more out of her than she's willing to admit.
what's the news?
OK, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this section of the ocean floor because the planet's crust is remarkably thin right below us, allowing them to drill directly into the magma and maximise the geothermal power output.
which means there's a great deal of potential energy directly beneath this station.
that's the news? That this place works as advertised?
no. No the news is that if they were to detonate, say, the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just such a wafer-thin crust ...
Oh my God.
all that thermal energy directly beneath us will be released all at once.
so, bad news.
Yeah. The initial explosion will be magnified a thousand times. We're talking catastrophic.
so it won't just be us that's affected.
no. Atlantis will be affected as well.
it's well within the blast radius.
and we have no way to warn them?
they'd never even see it coming.
so we disarm the self-destruct.
that's brilliant, but we still need to get there.
and how do we do that without the Jumper?
we're way behind schedule.
they're gonna send a rescue Jumper any minute now.
even if they've left already - I mean the moment we were overdue ...
no, they won't make it in time.
how far is the cruiser?
um less than a kilometre.
she swam that far?!
what is she?!
a formidable enemy.
I have an idea.
I found these in the database when we first got here.
they were used primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.
very cool!
Yeah. You should be able to traverse the distance between here and the cruiser.
you mean we.
Yes, of course. We.
this must be how she got in.
probably
alright. Let's get suited up.
right.
you're breathing too hard.
forgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.
just think of it as a walk on the beach a beach that's about to explode.
that's supposed to make me feel better?!
no, it's supposed to make you walk faster.
we're on the clock here.
this is Weir. How close are you?
almost there but we're runnin' out of time
we may need Teyla to do her Kreskin act again.
I'd rather not have to.
I think it could be much too dangerous for her.
so is exploding magma.
I am walking as fast as I can.
how do we disarm the self-destruct?
you won't survive the blast any more than we will.
I can get the information we need.
if you are strong enough you would have done so already.
I can feel how weak you are.
we shall see who is stronger.
Hey, that took too long.
Yeah, well
I probably won't be able to disarm the self- destruct in time anyway so we're really not in a rush.
why don't we find it first, and then you can be negative?
the ship is remarkably preserved.
you'd think after ten thousand years, she'd want to redecorate.
I'm serious.
the hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their main drive.
you're saying this thing is salvageable?
hmm, I'd have to assess damage to primary systems but it's not completely out of the question.
of course, you'd probably just go and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all that work'd be for nothing.
tick, tick, tick.
this way.
you are weakening.
Teyla, I think you should stop.
my concentration slipped for just a moment.
and in that moment, I could have crushed you with a single thought.
perhaps next time, I will.
there isn't gonna be a next time.
Elizabeth, I am fine.
no, you're not.
I can see what this is doing to you.
let's just give McKay a chance.
there it is.
what?
I'm pretty sure this is the device and I'm pretty sure it says we have less than half an hour.
so turn it off.
what does that mean?
it's not accepting commands of any kind.
there must be some kind of a command code that needs to be entered first.
can you figure it out?
Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple like the number one or the letter A like, in Wraith, which would be, umm ...
can you figure out the code or not?
No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years and we have ...
just under a million years less than that
Elizabeth, you there?
any luck?
negative
if we don't get the command code in less than thirty minutes we're dead.
this is the only way.
I told you, Rodney has another idea.
that may or may not succeed.
there is only one way to be certain.
she said she would kill you next time.
I will not let that happen.
no.
we're gonna give them more time.
there's been an emergency in the Control Room. Doctor Weir needs your help.
what about her?
I'll watch the prisoner.
hurry.
watch yourself.
are you fool enough to try again?
I have very little to lose.
you're trying to hide something from me.
there's been a development.
were you able to disarm the self-destruct device?
no but Rodney thinks if we can tie in a naqahdah generator he can still get the Wraith cruiser to fly.
after all these years?
Yeah. The damage is superficial.
the problem was the engines.
McKay's already restored power and I think
I can fly the ship to a safe distance.
that's a suicide mission.
well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland maybe I can get far enough away from the explosion
I gotta go now.
wait
let me try again.
if I can get her to give up her command code you won't have to risk it.
you're in no condition to do that.
sorry.
you're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you that.
you have restored power?
it'll fly.
you shall be rewarded ... with a quick death.
she's not dying according to plan here!
I thought you'd forgotten about me!
of course not! I just had to wait for her to disable the device.
hey just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the command code.
Oh, that's why you didn't wanna be bait!
no-no-no-no. You had to be bait because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.
she is dead, right?
let's get outta here.
How're you feelin'?
much better now that I no longer feel the constant presence of a Wraith.
that was no ordinary Wraith.
it took a lot of bullets to take her down.
I wish I was there.
he's right, you know.
I mean, deceiving a Wraith Queen that's no small feat.
well, when there are so many lives at stake, it's easy to summon the strength.
well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up.
turns out Atlantis had sent another Jumper.
should be here within the hour.
that's good news!
Yeah, no kiddin'. I can't wait to see the sun.
what? No-no-no - we haven't finished what we came here for.
look, the Wraith's gone - we've got a ton of research to do.
Yes, we do.
in fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.
is he serious?
Yeah. He is.
well, I for one intend to spend the next little while resting.
same here.
yeah
same here.
=www. ydy. E613com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
you have some Wraith DNA
my father told people it was a gift
I could help my people by warning them of the Wraith's approach.
no matter how many Wraith ships be destroyed more can come here.
you're saying you think Teyla might be able to...
tap into this Wraith psychic network?
if she can we'll be able to gather all the intel we ever needed about them.
I would not even consider asking you to do this if I didn't think it could potentially provide us with some vital information.
Dr. Beckett will remain on hand at all times to monitor your physiology.
I am on a ship.
you are all so pathetic.
um ... shotgun ... is it?
Oh, come on.
I don't know why I have to do this.
what?
nobody said anything.
you don't have to, do you?
look, it's not my fault things are hard to find on the bottom of the ocean.
Rodney, you said you knew where it was.
I said I knew its last known location.
it is a mobile drilling station, remember?
obviously that's gonna take a few hours.
if we don't find it soon, this is gonna be your last known location.
Oh, zing!
OK, kids.
do I have to pull this thing over?
it's hard enough being in this damned thing for hours without listening to you guys.
actually, Doctor McKay has managed to narrow the search field to a remarkably small area.
Finally! The voice of reason!
thank you, Doctor ... um ...
Yes, yes, of course. Well, welcome to the team.
uh, I've been here almost eight months.
Really?
Oh.
it's been that long, has it?
time certainly flies.
of course, not sitting in a Jumper looking for a needle in a haystack.
you know what? Shut up!
you know what? You shut up, OK?
Hey! I don't hear Grayson complaining!
uh, it's Graydon, with a 'd'.
what?
you sure?
it's my name.
no-no-no, 'cause I could have sworn that the guy I wanted from your department was called Grayson, 'cause I remember thinking Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne's ward.
well, it's Graydon.
perhaps that means I hired the wrong guy.
well, still glad you came?
Oh, sorry. I was preoccupied thinking about the geothermal drilling platform.
shouldn't take us much longer.
we just passed the thermal layer and I'm getting some readings a couple of hundred feet ahead.
if we did manage to find an alternate and potentially limitless power supply that would make even this insufferably long search seem worthwhile.
OK, kids, we're here.
well, hopefully it won't take too much longer to power up the station.
that wasn't so hard.
now all I've gotta do is dock this thing and we can find out what this place is all about.
submersion
all systems are online and functioning at full capacity.
you mean we're generating power already?
well ...
no. No-no, but we probably could if we wanted to.
no, slow down.
the Ancients abandoned this project for a reason.
let's try to find out what that reason might be before we start drilling into the planet's crust.
Yes, well, fair enough.
have we not been down this hallway before?
every corridor looks the same.
don't worry. I have an uncanny sense of direction.
I think she's right.
we've been down this way before.
that's impossible.
we took a left, and a left, and then a right.
Hey, look, all I'm saying is ...
what?
I am sensing a Wraith presence nearby.
are you sure?
we're pretty deep underwater.
I cannot be certain, but I believe it is onboard the drilling platform.
this is Sheppard.
everyone drop what you're doing; get back to the Control Room immediately.
we did a complete life signs scan.
it's the first thing we did when we stepped aboard this station.
look, I promise you, there is nobody here but us.
I know, Rodney, but I am sensing it even closer now.
well, maybe it's the pressure.
it's been known to do things to the mind.
just humour me and check again.
there.
all of these life signs have been accounted for.
Humoured?
wraith don't show up on life signs detectors if they're hibernating.
I know what I am sensing.
there is no Wraith here! I'm telling you!
has your sense ever been wrong?
never.
and I cannot shake this feeling.
I trust her.
as opposed to irrefutable fact?
your machines don't know everything.
I never said that they did.
there is a way for me to be sure.
if I can reach out with my mind and establish a link ...
that's a little reckless, don't you think?
if there is no Wraith, then there will be no mind for me to link with and therefore no risk.
but if there is a Wraith nearby ... we need to know.
I am ready.
you sure?
the briefest contact will determine whether or not I'm right.
that's all we need, so don't stick around any longer.
and we will bring you out of it at the first sign of trouble.
just to be sure ...
it's already set to stun.
sorry.
I was mistaken.
there's nothing there.
well, that's good.
I'm sorry.
no reason to be sorry.
perhaps it was the effect of the pressure at this depth.
well, if you've ever seen "The Abyss," pressure can make you nuts.
not that I think you're nuts.
it's alright, John.
I am relieved.
so am I.
well, we have a lot of exploring to do.
we?
until Rodney delivers the preliminary status report,
I'm all yours. Put me to work, Colonel.
alright, let's make up some time. Break into teams.
Ronon, you're with Teyla. Elizabeth, you're with me
or I'm with you, however you wanna put it.
either [ee-ther] way ...
or either [eye-ther] way.
that was weird.
well, we are at the very bottom of the ocean.
maybe you're right.
Teyla's just experiencing the effects of the pressure.
hopefully not as bad as that guy in "The Abyss.
this place is big, huh?
what's wrong?
nothing. Why?
you just haven't said a word.
have I not?
no.
has my silence made you uncomfortable?
no.
your friendship is very important to me.
I would hate to do anything that made you ... uncomfortable.
well... good
what's going on?
what do you mean, what's going on?
we just lost the lights.
what?
you're right.
Yes, we can see that!
we just lost power to forty percent of the station.
sensors are currently offline.
Zelenka, what are you doing?
uh, what do you mean, what am I doing?
have you lost power where you are?
no.
have you?
no.
we have.
I wanna know what's going on.
you know, this station has been lying idle down here for a few millennia.
we're bound to blow a few fuses.
look, I'll have power back online in a minute. Just hang tight.
report your position.
Ronon, Teyla? Come in.
Rodney, we've lost contact with Ronon and Teyla.
you know their position?
no, negative.
internal sensors are out, but I have determined the location where the power went down.
it's an auxiliary control area, search grid six.
it's the deck that Ronon and Teyla were exploring.
we'll meet you there.
it's, uh, Dickenson, sir.
Yeah, well, I was in the ballpark. Just give me a break here.
look, get back to the Jumper
see if you can use its sensors to determine the location of our people within the drilling platform.
sir.
Graydon, you go with him.
there you are.
weapons fire.
nine mil. This way.
Oh, yes. Let's race towards the gunfire!
Ronon, Teyla, come in.
are you alright?
No!
did you see who attacked you?
Yeah, it was Teyla.
What?! Why?
OK, until we know what's going on,
I'd like everyone in one place.
this is Zelenka.
someone has just activated emergency forcefields throughout the station.
can you make it back to the Control Room?
Yes, I think so.
do it.
that doesn't make any sense. What's she doing?
you and Elizabeth go back to the Control Room.
ronon and I are gonna check up on Teyla.
be careful.
no kidding!
drop it.
what the hell's going on?
I do not know.
Rodney, what's the status?
as far from the "quo" as it gets.
look, Teyla didn't just shut down several key systems;
she scrambled the existing operating codes.
this is going to take a while.
can we contact Atlantis?
the station's communication system is just gone.
I can't even patch it. She's blown the control crystals
and shut down half the power to the station and set up a series of emergency forcefields.
to what purpose?
this is Sheppard.
we've got Teyla.
And?
and nothin'.
she has no memory of anything that happened the last hour.
we're on our way to Crew Quarters.
I'll meet you there.
OK, let's forget about restoring the station to its former glory.
concentrate your efforts on internal sensors and disabling the forcefields that are cutting us off from the Jumper.
Elizabeth, I'm so sorry.
don't worry about that.
how are you feeling now?
I'm fine but to hear of the damage I caused and yet to have no memory of my actions ...
just tell us what you do remember.
I was attempting to seek out the Wraith presence with my mind and then ...
there is a Wraith?
the most powerful mind I have ever encountered.
I tried to shut her out ...
her?
Yes.
I believe this Wraith is a Queen.
I hate Queens.
in that brief moment, I sensed great power the experiences of many centuries hunger ...
and then nothing
my next memory is of Colonel Sheppard and Ronon aiming their weapons towards me.
so there is a Wraith aboard the drilling platform.
if that were the case why'd she use Teyla to do all that damage and why didn't the life signs detector pick up a signal?
doesn't matter.
if she's here - I'll find her. - We'll find her.
I would like to help.
I'm sorry, Teyla, - but until we can determine exactly what ... - Yes, of course.
I understand.
any progress on disabling those forcefields?
I'm getting indications that some of them are going up and down.
we could really use the Jumper's sensors.
I'm doing my best, sir.
one of these days I'm just going to call him Doctor McCoy.
I'd love to be there for that!
well, the next time he calls me Grayson ...
actually, I know a Grayson.
there really is a Grayson?
Yeah. He's a damned good scientist, too.
I'm surprised McKay didn't hire him.
did you do that?
I don't know but I'm happy to take credit for it.
check it out.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
what could the Wraith possibly want with an Ancient drilling platform?
for that matter, how did they even get here?
maybe on a ship nearby.
underwater?
who knows?
Teyla's spidey-sense works for miles.
look, are the external sensors up and running?
uh, yes, they're operational, but they're designed to scan the ocean floor.
doesn't matter.
take a look at the drilling platform's external sensors see what you turn up.
what am I looking for?
anything.
how are you feeling?
I have never been more ashamed.
Oh, you can't blame yourself.
I should have been more careful.
a Wraith Queen's mind is extremely powerful, Teyla.
you know that better than I do. - Still if my actions while under her control result in people getting hurt ...
if you hadn't done what you did, who knows what could have happened?
at least now we know what we're dealing with.
if anything, I should thank you.
I certainly don't blame you.
I would like to help them find her.
there is no risk.
I don't know that.
unless you suspect I am still under her control even now.
would I be alone with you if I did?
then you think I am somehow vulnerable to her.
I think it is best to keep you away from her for the moment, yes.
look, I don't fully understand this capability you have of linking with a Wraith mind but if it's even remotely possible that ...
she was only able to control me because I opened my mind to her.
if I choose to do so again,
I will be ready.
Teyla, I know you wanna help.
I do.
the best way for you to do that is allow Ronon and Colonel Sheppard to find her.
as you wish.
it's about time.
I was beginning to think you'd gotten lost.
listen, did you manage to, uh ...
Colonel Sheppard!
if you can hear me, please ...
help me!
who am I talking to?
what's your location?
do you have any men unaccounted for?
two guys I just sent back to the Jumper.
I think they're in trouble. Can you get those forcefields down?
we're working on it.
the Wraith presence is even stronger than before.
she is aboard this station. You must warn them.
Colonel Sheppard
Teyla's certain the Wraith is aboard the station.
understood.
Ronon, I'm headin' back to the Jumper. Meet me there.
I'm on my way.
help me! Please!
Yeah-yeah-yeah. Almost there.
I can only do one at a time.
the Jumper's sensors should be able to locate them.
Graydon's dead.
fed upon.
what about Dickenson?
no sign of him yet.
let's see if we can find him using the, uh ...
Sheppard, come in.
you are Sheppard.
the one who can fly this ship.
you will return me to the surface.
kneel.
Sheppard, this is McKay. What've you got?
Sheppard, can you hear me?
is something wrong?
you will fly me to the Stargate and return me to my people.
Sheppard, this is McKay. Please respond.
Sheppard, come in!
I'm here.
we had to throw the emergency forcefields up.
the section you were in was flooding.
I noticed!
see, you were thrown by the force of the water clear of the forcefield bulkhead.
I missed.
I noticed that too!
everyone else is accounted for.
any sign of Dickenson?
stand by, McKay.
look, I don't know what just happened, but we are now cut off from the Jumper.
I won't miss now.
wait!
what for?
well, we lost the Jumper, we lost communications with Atlantis.
maybe she can help us get out of this place.
welcome back.
I trust you're comfortable.
that groggy sensation you're feeling are the sedatives we're pumping you full of.
just a precaution.
as for the other precautions ...
now, you're gonna tell us everything we want to know.
in exchange for ...?
this is not a negotiation.
I disagree.
let me get this over with.
how did you get aboard this station?
are there any more of you?
you are all about to die.
Really?
you care to elaborate on that at all?
we should be able to keep the forcefields up until Atlantis sends a rescue Jumper but station communications are still down, so ...
I should have listened to Teyla. This wouldn't have happened.
don't worry about it, Rodney. It's not your fault.
I'm the one who sent those men back to the Jumper.
well, the sensors indicated that there was nobody here, so ...
I don't think there was, sir.
I think the Wraith arrived here after we did the initial scans.
what?
you asked me to do a search with the remote sensors. I found something.
we didn't notice it on the way down because it's radiating very little E. M.
guys? Head back here.
I think I have a few answers.
a Wraith cruiser.
it's almost completely buried in silt.
which means it's been here a very, very, very long time.
Yes, give or take a very.
that doesn't explain how she got here.
maybe she swam over.
no, no.
the pressure at that depth is ... is deadly to humans, but she's not human, remember?
Yes, it's difficult to imagine, but with the Wraith's ability to heal itself ...
and there are no other Wraith on board?
no way to know for sure.
our prisoner isn't talking, other than "You're all about to die.
which may or may not be an empty threat.
then you have no way of knowing?
well, she said it with a lot of confidence.
there is a way to find out.
we've already been down that road.
and what is to stop her exerting control over you again?
she's heavily sedated.
and this time I know exactly what I'm dealing with.
you.
I was caught offguard the first time.
that will not happen again.
it does not matter.
well, we think it does.
your fate is sealed.
if you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.
I won't.
I see her ... leading the first wave of ships that attacked Atlantis during the war.
queen of a great alliance.
her ship was damaged during the battle.
it crashed into the ocean.
she fed upon her own crew to survive.
too deep to ever swim to the surface ... waking between centuries ...
waiting for rescue that never came ...
until finally she was alone.
she sensed our presence during our descent.
she sensed ...me and saw us as her one chance of freedom from her prison.
the water was ... crushing but she was determined
finally after all these millennia a ship!
but she did not possess the gene to fly it.
she used Dickenson to call for me.
you are all about to die.
that does not sound like Teyla.
you are all about to die.
you are all about to die.
Teyla, snap out of it!
wait!
she has activated the self-destruct device of the Wraith cruiser.
it is set to detonate within two hours.
so not an empty threat.
how's Teyla?
she's resting.
I think it took a lot more out of her than she's willing to admit.
what's the news?
OK, well, it looks like the Ancients chose this section of the ocean floor because the planet's crust is remarkably thin right below us, allowing them to drill directly into the magma and maximise the geothermal power output.
which means there's a great deal of potential energy directly beneath this station.
that's the news? That this place works as advertised?
no. No the news is that if they were to detonate, say, the self-destruct of a Wraith cruiser on just such a wafer-thin crust ...
Oh my God.
all that thermal energy directly beneath us will be released all at once.
so, bad news.
Yeah. The initial explosion will be magnified a thousand times. We're talking catastrophic.
so it won't just be us that's affected.
no. Atlantis will be affected as well.
it's well within the blast radius.
and we have no way to warn them?
they'd never even see it coming.
so we disarm the self-destruct.
that's brilliant, but we still need to get there.
and how do we do that without the Jumper?
we're way behind schedule.
they're gonna send a rescue Jumper any minute now.
even if they've left already - I mean the moment we were overdue ...
no, they won't make it in time.
how far is the cruiser?
um less than a kilometre.
she swam that far?!
what is she?!
a formidable enemy.
I have an idea.
I found these in the database when we first got here.
they were used primarily to make repairs to the exterior of the station.
very cool!
Yeah. You should be able to traverse the distance between here and the cruiser.
you mean we.
Yes, of course. We.
this must be how she got in.
probably
alright. Let's get suited up.
right.
you're breathing too hard.
forgive me for being aware of exactly how much pressure is being exerted on this suit right now.
just think of it as a walk on the beach a beach that's about to explode.
that's supposed to make me feel better?!
no, it's supposed to make you walk faster.
we're on the clock here.
this is Weir. How close are you?
almost there but we're runnin' out of time
we may need Teyla to do her Kreskin act again.
I'd rather not have to.
I think it could be much too dangerous for her.
so is exploding magma.
I am walking as fast as I can.
how do we disarm the self-destruct?
you won't survive the blast any more than we will.
I can get the information we need.
if you are strong enough you would have done so already.
I can feel how weak you are.
we shall see who is stronger.
Hey, that took too long.
Yeah, well
I probably won't be able to disarm the self- destruct in time anyway so we're really not in a rush.
why don't we find it first, and then you can be negative?
the ship is remarkably preserved.
you'd think after ten thousand years, she'd want to redecorate.
I'm serious.
the hull damage is minimal. They probably just lost their main drive.
you're saying this thing is salvageable?
hmm, I'd have to assess damage to primary systems but it's not completely out of the question.
of course, you'd probably just go and blow it up or slam it into a hive ship or something, and all that work'd be for nothing.
tick, tick, tick.
this way.
you are weakening.
Teyla, I think you should stop.
my concentration slipped for just a moment.
and in that moment, I could have crushed you with a single thought.
perhaps next time, I will.
there isn't gonna be a next time.
Elizabeth, I am fine.
no, you're not.
I can see what this is doing to you.
let's just give McKay a chance.
there it is.
what?
I'm pretty sure this is the device and I'm pretty sure it says we have less than half an hour.
so turn it off.
what does that mean?
it's not accepting commands of any kind.
there must be some kind of a command code that needs to be entered first.
can you figure it out?
Yes, well, command codes are usually quite simple like the number one or the letter A like, in Wraith, which would be, umm ...
can you figure out the code or not?
No! Not if I stood here and tried for a million years and we have ...
just under a million years less than that
Elizabeth, you there?
any luck?
negative
if we don't get the command code in less than thirty minutes we're dead.
this is the only way.
I told you, Rodney has another idea.
that may or may not succeed.
there is only one way to be certain.
she said she would kill you next time.
I will not let that happen.
no.
we're gonna give them more time.
there's been an emergency in the Control Room. Doctor Weir needs your help.
what about her?
I'll watch the prisoner.
hurry.
watch yourself.
are you fool enough to try again?
I have very little to lose.
you're trying to hide something from me.
there's been a development.
were you able to disarm the self-destruct device?
no but Rodney thinks if we can tie in a naqahdah generator he can still get the Wraith cruiser to fly.
after all these years?
Yeah. The damage is superficial.
the problem was the engines.
McKay's already restored power and I think
I can fly the ship to a safe distance.
that's a suicide mission.
well, if I can ditch the ship on the mainland maybe I can get far enough away from the explosion
I gotta go now.
wait
let me try again.
if I can get her to give up her command code you won't have to risk it.
you're in no condition to do that.
sorry.
you're a hell of a swimmer, I'll give you that.
you have restored power?
it'll fly.
you shall be rewarded ... with a quick death.
she's not dying according to plan here!
I thought you'd forgotten about me!
of course not! I just had to wait for her to disable the device.
hey just be thankful she didn't feed on you before she entered the command code.
Oh, that's why you didn't wanna be bait!
no-no-no-no. You had to be bait because she was expecting you to be the one trying to fly the ship.
she is dead, right?
let's get outta here.
How're you feelin'?
much better now that I no longer feel the constant presence of a Wraith.
that was no ordinary Wraith.
it took a lot of bullets to take her down.
I wish I was there.
he's right, you know.
I mean, deceiving a Wraith Queen that's no small feat.
well, when there are so many lives at stake, it's easy to summon the strength.
well, Zelenka's finally got communications back up.
turns out Atlantis had sent another Jumper.
should be here within the hour.
that's good news!
Yeah, no kiddin'. I can't wait to see the sun.
what? No-no-no - we haven't finished what we came here for.
look, the Wraith's gone - we've got a ton of research to do.
Yes, we do.
in fact, I'm pretty sure we should be able to come up with a way to get auxiliary power online in a couple of days.
is he serious?
Yeah. He is.
well, I for one intend to spend the next little while resting.
same here.
yeah
same here.
=www. ydy. E613com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
what's the nature of major Sheppard's injury?
some sort of funky alien bugattached itself to his neck.
part of Ellia is human and part of her comes from a creature we call the Iratus bug.
she took the retrovirus.
you said it wasn't ready.
it's not, not by a long shot.
it looks like you've been infected with the Iratus bug retrovirus.
it's beginning to alter his DNA.
he'll devolve into a creature similar to what Ellia became.
I'm not safe to be around anymore.
eyes straight ahead.
focus on me.
never ever look away from your enemy.
it shows weakness.
are you weak?
uh, no.
good.
then you're ready?
um ...
McKay, what did I say?
don't take your eyes off me.
you've gotta anticipate the next move.
you alright?
alright, well, I'll try to ease up so I don't hurt you.
Thanks.
you're gettin' better.
Really?
no.
Oh.
how are the ninja lessons going, Jet Li?
what do you want?
we lost contact with the Taranans.
you mean the volcano people?
supervolcano people.
what happened to them?
well, we don't know.
seeing how we lost contact with them.
they usually check in from time to time from their new settlement.
we've been sending them food, medical supplies.
it's the least we could do since getting the Orion blown up.
but we haven't heard from them for a few months.
I tried to contact them by radio but no response.
so send a MALP.
we just did.
everything looks OK but the settlement's a couple of kilometres from the Gate so we don't know anything yet.
I want you to check it out.
what?
Ooh!
eyes. Yes.
you may wanna change first.
they've got a lot done in the short time they've been here.
they are hard-working people.
I've made several trips to assist them in getting settled.
this is Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard from Atlantis calling anyone in the Taranan settlement.
please respond.
I thought I'd give it a shot.
alright, let's go.
anybody home?
well, it looks like they abandoned the place.
well, maybe they found somewhere better to live.
but they left everything behind. Why would they do that?
let's get these work stations powered up.
maybe we can figure out where these people went.
Oh.
I got something.
a single life sign.
where is it?
it's, uh, below us.
quite a way below us.
they built underground?
no. One of the previous civilisations that lived here was similar to the Genii, living below the surface to avoid detection by the Wraith.
they left behind several underground passages but the Taranans didn't utilise them.
Yeah, well, someone is.
how do we get there?
wait!
what is that?
looks like a cocoon of some sort.
what's inside it?
well, whatever it is it's not inside any more.
vengeance
has Colonel Sheppard's team dialled in with a status report yet?
not yet, but they haven't been gone that long.
go ahead and dial them.
how's it going there?
I think I know why we lost contact with the Taranans.
Why?
they're gone.
What?!
all of them?
looks like it.
the entire settlement is deserted.
Rodney's picked up a life sign underneath the tunnel.
we're tracking it, but we don't think it's human, though.
why not?
we discovered a large cocoon in one of the rooms under the settlement and we think whatever hatched from it is what we're detecting.
did you just say "cocoon"?
Yeah, it's like a big slimy ... - It's a pod.
well, I was gonna say "egg," but who knows what the hell it is?
I'm sending in back-up.
we can handle it.
I know you can handle it, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.
I'll send in a team of marines to assist you.
alright.
if you feel the need.
I feel the need.
Weir out.
it's a hell of a complex down here.
it's like a maze.
we're closer.
how far?
forty metres.
it's stopped moving, so we're gaining ground on it.
alright, good. Look, if it makes any sudden moves ... I want you to make sure that ...
Where's Ronon?
in here.
Oh my God!
Taranans!
wounds on their neck all of them.
does this look familiar?
it looks disturbingly familiar.
you don't think, uh ...
Oh, for God's sakes!
in here.
you can't wander off like that.
you gotta ...
Oh, no.
iratus bug!
I hate those things.
that explains why the wounds looked so familiar.
what is it doing here?
iratus bugs are not indigenous to this planet.
well, somebody brought it here.
let's hope it's the only bug they brought.
so, some kind of a Wraith experiment?
well, I doubt the Taranans did this to themselves.
I do not sense any Wraith in this settlement.
Oh our little friend is on the move.
it's headed right for us.
how fast? - Very fast.
it knows we're here. - Ronon, stun.
Why? - Stun.
Colonel Sheppard, come in.
Colonel Sheppard, this is Lieutenant Negley. Do you copy?
Yes, Lieutenant.
sir, my team has just come through the Gate and we're proceeding to the settlement in order ...
great. Terrific. We'll meet you there.
right now I need radio silence. Sheppard out.
it's stopped.
Why?
how am I supposed to know?!
well, where is it? - I think it's out in the tunnel.
it's close.
are you alright?
Yeah, I'm good.
what the hell was that thing?
what is that?
it's a piece of an arm it looks like.
let's hope that slows him down.
well, maybe it'll bleed to death.
or just grow another arm.
dart!
it's still moving away from us.
let's hope losing a chunk of his arm slows him down.
we need to finish it off to make sure.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Yeah, and how're we gonna do that, huh?
am I the only one who noticed that our bullets had no effect on it?
it appears to have a hardened shell on its back.
right, set that thing to kill again.
lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard. How far away from the settlement are you?
Negley, this is Sheppard, come in?
you did say radio silence.
respond!
great.
it's through that doorway.
this is not good.
doctor Weir?
we just received a data transmission from the Taranan settlement.
lieutenant Negley checking in.
and how are they doing?
well, they've contacted Colonel Sheppard's team.
they're about ten kilometres further inland from the settlement.
Negley and his team are on their way to meet up with them.
ten kilometres inland? What are they doing there?
well, they found the Taranans.
apparently they've abandoned their settlement for a better location inland.
what about the cocoon and the life sign they were tracking?
there was no mention about it.
it was a brief transmission - they were almost out of range.
OK. Good.
keep me posted.
we've searched the whole room. That thing ain't in there.
just a bunch of unhatched eggs.
pods.
whatever.
is there another way out?
no. It's the only door to the room.
well, then, he must have found another way out, because it is still on the move.
alien.
the movie, Alien.
they used the air shafts when they over-ran the ship.
and then they systematically killed the entire crew one by one.
thank you for bringing that up.
they didn't kill them all.
what do we do now?
track this thing down and kill it.
agreed.
but first things first.
the structure is very peculiar.
yeah? I believe the word is "disgusting."
go, go, go, go, go! Sheppard! They're hatching!
we're good. Let's go!
shut the door!
fire in the hole.
everyone OK?
Yes.
I'm good.
I think you singed my eyebrows!
do you think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?
I think we got them all.
well, that's good.
except for our armless friend - he's still on the move.
let's go get him.
lieutenant Negley, this is Sheppard, do you read?
Negley, respond.
dammit!
perhaps they encountered the creature.
and what? Killed all four of them?
no way. No creature is gonna take out four marines.
it almost killed all of us.
but it didn't.
we need to find them.
if they were alive, we would see them on the life signs detector.
not if they didn't make it to the settlement.
this thing only has a range of a hundred metres.
Where's the creature now?
wait a minute.
it's back that way.
behind us?
you just said it was that way.
I did! Well, it was, but it must have ...
it must have doubled back.
damned air shafts.
well, obviously it knows its way around this place better than we do.
perhaps we should consider returning to the Gate.
what, you mean give up?
no, not give up.
we can find out what happened to the marines and request additional back-up so that we may do a proper search of the settlement.
I like this plan - I mean, if we're taking a vote.
sounds like giving up to me.
Teyla's right. Enough of this cat and mouse.
we're better off doing a full-scale sweep of this area.
including the air shafts.
alright. How do we get out of here?
this way.
on all the worlds I've been to,
I have never encountered anything like it.
did anybody get a good look at that thing?
aside from its severed appendage, no. That thing moved incredibly fast.
in some ways, it looked almost like a human.
if, by "human," you mean clad in a grotesquely proportioned exoskeleton, yes - very human.
I meant it looked like it had two arms and two legs.
it looked like a giant bug to me.
I hate those things.
if it was indeed a Wraith experiment, perhaps it was created by combining the genetic elements of the iratus bug with the Taranans.
which is, as we know, exactly how the Wraith evolved.
I mean, iratus bug bites human, human DNA mixes with theirs, a thousand years go by, Wraith.
so, what? They're tryin' to create more Wraith?
that doesn't make any more sense.
if they wanted to create more Wraith, wouldn't it be easier to get a male and female to, you know, get a room?
it doesn't work that way with the Wraith, alright?
at least, we don't think it does.
we're not entirely sure as to the Wraiths' reproductive methods.
I don't wanna be around to watch that film.
anyway look, it's probably less likely that they were trying to create another Wraith than they were actually trying to create some kind of a hybrid creature probably to be used as a weapon.
Super-Wraith?
that's all we need!
well, that's the whole distance from the settlement.
I don't see any sign of the marines yet.
maybe they went back to Atlantis.
no, they would have radioed us.
they must have encountered the creature.
there's no other explanation for why they are not responding to us.
if that thing took them all out, then-then that is one nasty bug ... person.
dial us out.
right.
no.
what?
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
control crystal's missing.
missing?
we can't dial out?
well, fix it.
it is not a matter of fixing, OK?
the crystal is just gone.
someone has removed it to prevent anyone else from dialling out.
stay here?
Hey, Elizabeth will wonder why we haven't checked in she'll dial up to get our status;
we can request back-up, also a Puddle Jumper to come and get us.
we don't know how long that'll be. That could be hours.
we will be safe here.
the life signs detector will alert us if the creature is nearby.
she's right: we can set up a, a, a - what do you call it - a perimeter, wait it out.
we're not leaving without those marines.
let's go back to the settlement.
what?
I am sensing something.
wraith?
I cannot be certain.
no.
no, I've still just got the one reading.
still on the move, heading ...
no.
no, I'm picking up another life sign.
it's popped up out of nowhere.
how is that possible?
maybe one of those eggs hatched.
maybe.
that, or part of the settlement is shielded.
maybe it's one of the marines.
well, if it is one of those marines, that something Teyla's sensing is heading right toward him.
they're close.
what was that?
Where'd she go?
I'm reading two life signs moving away from us, but one floor up, I think. That, - or more air shafts. - Let's go.
wait!
they disappeared.
what?
the life signs - they just vanished. I was right.
part of this settlement must be shielded.
wait! No! We won't be able to track them.
what?
this will proceed much more quickly if you don't resist.
Hello, Teyla.
you need to aim for the stomach area.
it seems to be more vulnerable it's the soft under-belly. You were able to kill it when you hit it there before.
Thanks.
which way?
I don't know.
it's not showing me anything. It's useless.
this way.
you are the one who's done all this?
all this?
this ...
experiment.
you murdered those people. You allowed those bugs to feed on them.
a necessary step in the process.
to create these creatures?
why are you doing this?
do you not recall our last encounter?
how you left me to die on that desolate planet?
the hive that finally rescued me they could tell something was different.
they sensed the human in me.
to them,
I was unclean.
I barely escaped that hive with my life.
so now I find myself hunted by both humans and Wraith.
so you can understand my need to protect myself.
to survive.
it did not have to be like this.
you could have lived with us.
as a human?
my consciousness erased by your retrovirus?
no.
I will live the rest of my life as I choose.
but I can't do it alone.
so, having taken my cue from the experiment your people performed on me,
I figured out how to reverse the process to create a being even more formidable than a Wraith.
it began with the feeding.
I allowed the bug to gorge itself, to absorb as much human DNA as possible.
this, of course, led to the death of the subject.
the timing of the feeding was critical ensuring that the bug laid its next egg quickly, before the genetic material could filter out of its body.
the embryo then contained enough human DNA for me to manipulate.
I accelerated the development, augmenting the complexity of its physiology.
there were several adjustments, several mistakes ...
until I finally found the perfect balance between strength, agility.
a perfect animal to do my bidding.
must be some kind of security lockdown.
whoever took Teyla no doubt triggered it.
figure how to open this up.
stand back.
Jeez!
you mind giving us a little more heads-up before you start blasting everything?!
you got any more C4?
I saw how you and your team destroyed the incubation room, but don't think that's the only one in this complex - and don't think that this is the only planet from which I'm conducting this experiment.
that's right.
soon hundreds of these creatures will be at my disposal, and their numbers will continue to grow so long as I have human subjects in supply.
and now that you're here,
I do.
alright, that's the last of the C4.
let's hope it's enough.
ready?
what happened?
alright, let's go.
serious energy spike.
what does that mean?
we probably just entered the shielded section of the settlement.
your friends are coming for you.
they'll meet the same fate as you, one by one.
others will come for us.
doctor Weir will send ...
don't concern yourself with Doctor Weir.
she thinks your team has met up with the Taranan people and all is well.
one of the marines she sent to help you was ...
kind enough to assist me in transmitting a message back to Atlantis.
please don't do this.
after what you did to me twice how could you expect anything less?
what happened back on the planet ... - No more excuses.
your experiment failed.
you decided to kill us.
we believed we were left with no choice.
and now I am in the same position.
you drove me to this.
Oh my God.
where are the others?
Sheppard. Over here.
you hear that?
Oh, it sounds like bugs!
Cmoe on.
put that thing away.
I thought you said it didn't work in this area anyway.
it is - I just, I thought I could recalibrate it to take into effect ...
it's dead.
nice shot!
you OK?
Yes.
it's Michael. He's the one doing this.
our Michael?
he's alive?
Yes.
he created the creatures and he is attempting to build an army of them.
where is he?
I don't know. He ran off as soon as he heard the gunfire.
alright. We need to come up with the best plan here.
the best plan is to kill him.
Hey, just hang on a second.
maybe I should check out these work stations.
look, there might be some intel.
we don't have any time.
such as how many of these creatures he created and if they have any weaknesses that we might be able to exploit.
alright.
Teyla, you stay with Rodney.
ronon and I are going after Michael. We'll stay in touch on the radio.
you can't.
shielded, remember?
look, the energy spike - it fouls the radio communications as well.
well, then, unshield it. Let's go.
you go that way, I'll go the other.
Oh, hey, wait.
set your gun to stun. - What?!
Yeah. We're gonna need to question him.
no. No more talking, no more questioning.
I'm gonna do what we should have done the first time we captured him.
Ronon, listen to me.
no, you listen to me, John.
this whole retrovirus thing was a mistake.
I said it then no-one listened to me.
it was a bad idea.
we had to try.
if it worked, we wouldn't ... - But it didn't work.
admit it.
it just made things worse.
how long do you wanna keep paying for it?
it is amazing how much work he's been able to get done in such a short amount of time.
he's quite the industrious little fella ...
or Wraith ... or ...
whatever. What does he looks like now?
I mean, is he, is he full-on Wraith again?
not quite.
there are still human characteristics present in him.
no doubt it's why I was confused when I first felt his presence.
you'd think that the human side of him would temper his aggression a bit.
yes because we humans aren't aggressive at all.
well, certainly less aggressive than, uh ...
Oh, sarcasm.
Yeah. Nice.
what Michael is doing right now must be stopped.
he cannot be allowed to escape. He's far too dangerous.
you're preaching to the choir, my dear.
but I understand his anger.
his life has been destroyed.
he no longer has a home or a family.
he had a family?!
I don't know, but I've often wondered what he left behind when he was captured by us.
we know nothing of his past other than that he was a Wraith.
a very smart Wraith.
perhaps he was a scientist.
huh. Sure.
probably. Why not?
one of their very best, I'd wager.
like you.
right.
wait a minute.
what is it?
I think I've just figured out how to disable the E. M. interference that is causing the shielding.
Sheppard, you there?
Hey, I'm here.
I got the shielding disabled.
so I see.
any luck finding Michael?
no sign of him yet.
is that life signs detector working yet?
Ooh, of course.
Oh, my God.
what?
I am reading a ton of life signs near you.
well, define "ton" ... and define "near.
uh, a few dozen. I mean, they're all bunched together.
prisoners in a holding cell, maybe?
or worse.
whatever they are, someone just released them and they're headed your way.
Oh, crap!
keep going, straight up the tunnel.
ronon should be coming around the corner towards you ...
now.
it's not Ronon.
it's one of the bugs?
Michael.
Colonel Sheppard.
no offence, but I was kinda hoping never to see you again.
I had hoped just the opposite.
well, then you've seen me.
now say your goodbyes.
but first, give me the control crystals to the DHD.
I don't think so.
or I can just kill you.
unless I stun you first.
as much as I'd like to sit around chatting ...
extraordinary, aren't they?
your army of bug people?
I thought you'd be impressed.
not so much.
after all, I'm merely continuing the experiment your people began.
what then?
take over the entire galaxy?
that's a little too Doctor Evil if you ask me.
Sheppard, the creatures are closing in on you fast.
you'd better get moving.
you and Teyla go to the Gate. We'll meet you there.
alright.
give me the control crystal.
I can't do that, Colonel.
just so we're clear.
I have no problem killing you.
and I have no problem with dying, because even if you kill me right now,
I'll die knowing that you and your team did not get off this planet alive.
go!
What?!
Hurry! They're coming!
this is messed up.
this must be where they got up.
what?
air shafts.
it's about time we used them.
Michael's.
no doubt.
are you thinkin' what I'm thinking?
I fly it;
pick you, Rodney and Teyla up;
we use the Dart's DHD to dial the Gate.
I was thinking, blow it up,
but your idea's better.
get moving.
wait!
what is it?
life signs up ahead.
Colonel Sheppard? Ronon?
doesn't sound like it.
life signs behind us, too.
it's closing in fast. Oh boy!
we're surrounded.
incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
lower the shield.
are you alright?
where are the marines?
didn't make it.
What?!
we barely made it ourselves.
we had to commandeer a Wraith Dart just to dial out.
we ditched it on another planet.
didn't wanna risk damaging the Control Room.
Daedalus can pick it up later.
what happened to the Taranans?
they're dead all of them.
wait a minute.
lieutenant Negley sent a message saying they'd just relocated to a new settlement.
no.
it was Michael.
he sent the transmission.
he's the one that killed the Taranans.
we'll tell you about it in a minute, but first, is the Daedalus here yet?
it's still a few days out. Why?
we're gonna need it to make another stop on the way.
OK.
I just came from McKay's lab.
he's been examining the research he was able to upload from Michael's experiment.
has he been able to determine just how many more of those creatures Michael was able to create?
well, not an exact figure, no, but Rodney believes it's well into the hundreds.
Yeah.
and it appears Michael has similar labs on at least three different planets.
it is amazing how quickly he has been able to incorporate our science into his.
what is it?
during our brief alliance with them last year.
we led Michael straight to them.
Colonel Caldwell just radioed.
they did a full sweep of the planet.
no life signs.
they searched the settlement: no Michael, no creatures.
he already dialled out.
Yeah.
we got the control crystal back in the DHD.
Rodney's trying to figure out the last address dialled but you know how long that takes.
to cover his tracks.
you can count on that.
we need to find him.
he's already too dangerous.
and I'm sure we're number one on his hit list.
they're not people. They're machines.
even built themselves a version of Atlantis
the probes of your minds uncovered the truth
you only came to live there from your original home, a planet called earth.
our intention is to destroy it.
they see humans as the favored siblings who receive all the parents' love.
they've been seeking revenge ever since.
Atlantis is under attack from replicators.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let a bunch of replicators take our home away from us.
they emit a directional energy beam that disrupts the connection between nanites.
the replicators literally fall apart when you fire on them.
well, we beat them this time.
maybe we scared them off.
maybe.
doctor Weir.
doctor Keller.
how is my head of medicine?
uh, Acting
head of medicine, actually, and that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about.
what's up?
uh, I need to be replaced.
excuse me?
look, after Carson ...
someone had to step up and take over, and I'm glad to help out, don't get me wrong, but
I'm not qualified to run a department of this size. You
you need someone ... better.
everyone down there says you're doing great.
well, I'm not sure that's true, and it's been pretty smooth sailing over the last few weeks.
I think I've been lucky.
well, the IOA are reviewing candidates but, to be honest, they're not that great at making quick decisions.
Yeah. So, a week?
two weeks?
I just haven't been sleeping very well.
this whole being in control thing kind of makes me anxious.
Carson felt the same way his first few months.
I appreciate you trying to lie to me.
look,
I feel very comfortable with my life in your hands;
and at the end of the day, that means you're doin' a pretty good job.
dealing with the pressure - it does get easier with time.
right.
uh, how much time, exactly?
like, it'll get easier over the next two weeks and then you'll replace me, so I can go back to being a regular doctor?
I'll keep you posted!
thanks
can I please have someone else do these?
performance evaluations? - Yes.
no.
year-end employee reviews are important.
they're how people get promotions, and raises.
OK, look. Asking me to do performance evaluations is ridiculous.
I am the first person to admit ...
.I don't know who these people are, nor do I care to.
look, if you'd like, I could take you down the hall to the labs and just point at the people who annoy me more than the rest, but that's about as useful as I get.
all done. - Oh, of course
that was quick!
Hey, John, wait a minute.
you've just given everyone excellent and above averages.
Ooh! Can I do that? - No!
I know this is not the most glamorous part of your job, but you are in leadership positions and, unfortunately, that comes with administrative responsibilities.
well, everybody who works for me is excellent and above average.
you want me to lie?
cause I don't think leaders should lie, Elizabeth.
doctor Weir?
Yes, Chuck?
the Apollo just came out of hyperspace.
they're ahead of schedule.
probably just tryin' to show off - you know, bein' a new ship an' all.
Colonel Ellis, you've made excellent time on your first voyage here.
thank you. I'm beaming down now.
very well. We'll meet ...
set up in the Conference Room.
doctor.
Colonel.
welcome.
thank you.
Colonel Sheppard,
doctor McKay.
this is gonna make things easier.
I'll need to brief you all immediately.
what's going on?
well, I'd prefer to talk in private.
ever since the human-form Replicators made a play for the city, we've had the Daedalus make regular reconnaissance fly-bys of their home planet.
Yes, we know.
two months ago, it took these pictures.
I'm sorry, what am I supposed to be looking at here?
nothing.
excuse me?
this image was taken about three weeks ago in the very same location.
they're building ships a lot of them.
why weren't we made aware of this?
I'm making you aware of it now.
well, if they're coming for us, we should start making preparations to bolster the shield.
I mean, we should ... - They're not gonna get here.
I'm here to inform you that in precisely twelve hours, the Apollo - in consort with your team will launch a surgical strike on the replicator planet.
so, uh, you're gonna blow up their ships.
that's right.
just like that?
just like that.
how the hell do you plan on doing that?
a set of Mark Nine tactical nukes
first strike housed in a custom-made weapons platform codenamed Horizon.
how many nukes do you have?
the Horizon carries six warheads and four decoys.
I'm gonna need you to do a final inspection before we head out.
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wait. Six?
that's right.
that's not enough.
the replicators are self-replicating robots, which means that they can ...
I'm aware of that, thank you, Doctor, but they're not like the Milky Way Replicators.
their ships aren't built from nano-cells.
they're constructed of real material that can be destroyed.
six will be more than enough for now.
for now?
look, isn't this a bit like poking a sleeping dragon?
why don't we just wait until area 51 finishes the PWARW?
which one's that, again?
Planetary-Wide Anti-Replicator Weapons.
look, the Asgard were capable of creating a satellite that could wipe out an entire replicator planet.
I mean, we've had some trouble making one of our own but ...
look, would I prefer taking out an entire planet at once? Absolutely.
but this image is giving the IOA a lot of sleepless nights.
the replicators know the location of Earth and, with these new ships, have the means to get there.
we can't just sit on our hands while the guys at area 51 try to come up with a solution.
this mission's primary objective is to eliminate key military targets.
we'll come back and finish once the new weapon is up and running.
doctor, I'm gonna need you to start your inspections as soon as possible.
well, yes, sure. I just ... - Doctor McKay is ready to beam.
well, he's not, actually ...
we're finished here.
thank you.
can you believe this?
no.
it all seems too good to be true.
What?!
well, if those nukes do what Ellis says they do ...
since we won back the city, we haven't heard so much as a peep from the replicators.
well, obviously they haven't gone away.
no, but maybe they've decided that we are more trouble than we're worth;
that the threat of our AR weapons is enough to keep them at bay.
you don't build that many ships to make a run at Atlantis.
they're headed for Earth.
Colonel.
may I have a word?
sure.
this mission is a mistake.
it most certainly is not.
it is an ineffectual first strike.
you've gotta know how dangerous that could be for us.
all due respect, Doctor, it won't be ineffectual.
besides, the IOA doesn't think we can wait.
I think we should stall them;
try to open a round of negotiations.
they're not a race of people.
they're a weapon. Try to keep that in mind.
weapon or not, they're sentient.
negotiating with them could buy us enough time to get the PWARW up and running.
usually I'd be more than happy to go twelve rounds here about who's right and who's wrong, but it wouldn't matter.
I have my orders, and you don't have the authority to tell me to stand down, so, again, with all due respect, ma'am , I have a mission to execute.
well, the specs check out.
we've loaded the target information.
they're ready.
Yeah.
it's good to go.
this is a bad idea, isn't it?
we could tell them they're not ready you know, there's a fault with the guidance system or something.
I thought about that.
they're gonna have guys here to contradict us pretty quickly. - Yep.
but we're here alone.
we could make them not ready.
they're building an armada, Radek.
I saw them.
they showed me the pictures.
I'd feel pretty stupid if we break this thing, only to have the replicators show up and destroy the city.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would be bad.
tell the Colonel we're good to go.
Hey.
Hey.
Colonel Ellis has asked me to join the mission.
I know.
I was gonna stay behind in a cloaked Jumper after they launch the warheads; do some battle damage assessment.
I know that too.
he told me that you called Woolsey and General O'Neill and tried to get the whole thing called off.
Yes, I did.
they didn't bite.
they did not.
look,
I know you think we're doing the wrong thing here, but, uh ...
good luck.
alright.
horizon is online.
the warheads are armed and we are ready for final sequencing as soon as we drop out of hyperspace.
start now.
open the bomb bay doors.
we're still in hyperspace.
we're coming out of our jump uncomfortably close to the planet.
I don't wanna waste any time. Just get it done.
well, you're the boss.
ready to launch on your command.
you're sure about this, right?
I mean, like, this is the right thing to do?
not the best time for that kind of talk, Doctor.
right. Sorry.
coming out of hyperspace in five, four,
launch the Horizon.
we have detonation confirmation on all six warheads.
Sheppard, you have a go for launch.
copy that.
clear. Jump away.
very well. We'll pick you up in an hour.
pull us out of here.
there is so much radiation interference, it's hard to get an accurate yield calculation from the scan telemetry.
please, there is more than enough data.
it's not like we're trying to take out a person here.
we're taking out massive chunks of a city.
someone just please tell me if we hit our targets or not.
if this data is right, then all of your primaries and most of your secondaries have been incinerated.
excellent.
welcome back.
Thanks.
I hear congratulations are in order.
Yeah, you heard right.
how was the mission? Was it a success?
we did get all the ships.
I wish I could've been there to see it.
well, space battles are always a lot more exciting on TV than they are in real life.
doctor Weir?
you're gonna wanna see this.
we've got a contact.
just came out of hyperspace.
is it broadcasting IFF?
no, ma'am.
wraith?
Naah. It's very small. I doubt it.
raise the shield.
it's taking up a geosynchronous orbit above the city.
what is it?
maybe we should have the Apollo check it out.
tell the Colonel he needs to get back to his ship.
right ahead of us, sir.
shields? - Affirmative. Shields are up.
OK, I've got a visual.
looks like a satellite of some sort.
it's a Stargate!
a Stargate?
that's right.
I thought you said it was a satellite.
it's both.
it's a satellite, but in the middle there's a ...
stargate.
what could be the purpose of that?
I've no idea.
it just activated.
the Gate?!
get us away from it!
sir, the satellite is turning again.
it's hitting the planet.
it's a sustained beam.
that is bad for a dozen different reasons.
it's protected by a shield.
give me some options, McKay.
the shield's taking its power from the beam.
look, I registered a slight drop in output when you fired on it.
could I get a nuke past its shield?
no, probably not.
I'll get in the Chair and give it everything we've got.
maybe that'll collapse the shield.
I said "slight" - as in point zero zero two.
look, I doubt any amount of firepower is gonna collapse it while that beam is active.
then what do we do?
we stand down and let me think, is what we do.
just give me five minutes to get my bearings. I'll brief you.
McKay, it's shooting at us.
Yes, and the shields are holding.
look, we've got plenty of time - just give me five minutes.
what've you got?
we're in trouble.
it took you five minutes to figure that out? You're slippin, buddy.
look, the satellite is basically just a stripped-down ship.
there's a hyperdrive engine, a shield, and navigational systems.
there's a small power source that was designed to take it to its intended target and power the shield until the gate can be dialled.
but once a wormhole has been established to whoever's on the dialling side it fires a beam into their Stargate and it comes out on our side, allowing them to fire on us and to power the satellite.
that's very clever.
Yes. As long as they can keep the beam powered from home, the weapon remains operational.
Oh, and one fun added side bonus is that because their Stargate is in such close proximity to our planet we can't dial our Stargate. We're stuck.
maybe that's a good thing.
the beam'll turn off at the end of the gate's thirty-eight minute cycle.
if we dial our gate at that precise moment, we can neutralise theirs.
what, and if it's not pulling power from the beam any more, then we can collapse its shield and destroy it.
sure.
the problem is, I don't think it's gonna shut down in thirty-eight minutes.
but I thought it was physically impossible for an artificial wormhole to stay open any longer.
there is one exception to that rule.
the SGC has encountered attacks of this kind on their own Stargate and sadly we've discovered that if you pump enough energy into it, a Stargate can remain active indefinitely.
that would require an insane amount of power, wouldn't it?
like a black hole - or an unlimited number of ZedPMs.
so we can assume the replicators are behind this.
well, I hope so. - You hope so?
well, otherwise, we've discovered yet another super-powerful enemy.
if it is a normal Stargate, can we still contact the dialling planet?
huh, well, I'll need to boost the signal considerably to get through the interference, but, uh, yes.
see what you can do, please. - Right.
why would you wanna contact them?
to negotiate.
it's a waste of energy. We need to figure out how to destroy it.
I'd love to go twelve rounds here about who's right and who's wrong, but at the end of the day I'm responsible for the well-being of this city, and you don't have the authority to tell me to stand down.
so with all due respect,
I think I'll place my call.
alright. I think I've got it.
they're responding to the transmission.
doctor Weir.
I must say I'm surprised to see you.
each of us exists within the collective and can be replicated many times.
you need to disable your weapon immediately.
that is not possible.
we had no choice but to attack you.
you're building warships. They need to be neutralised.
and now, so do you.
that assault was just the tip of the spear.
we were hoping it would bring you to your senses.
if you don't stop this aggression, we will be forced to launch an all-out attack.
Really?
why have you waited?
the annihilation of your people is not our goal.
ideally, we would like a peace to exist between us, but we will not stand idly by while you build ships and weapons that can be used to destroy us.
interesting.
we feel the same way about you.
perhaps I should remind you every time we've met in battle, our side has been clearly victorious.
they're attempting to upload a virus on the comm bandwidth.
I've been able to stop it for now but I'm not ... - Shut it down.
well, that went well!
Yeah.
always been one of my favourites.
what if the gate doesn't shut down at the end of its thirty- eight minute cycle?
look, if they're able to maintain the energy beam's intensity - which I'm sure they will ...
and how long 'til our shield fails?
it's twenty-nine hours.
well, it was worth a shot.
alright, we're gonna need another plan.
Yeah, OK.
look, stop dialling. It's not working.
sir.
you two give us a minute.
what can I do for you, John?
we need to head back to the replicator planet.
we do, do we?
Yeah. If this satellite weapon is powered by its homeworld, maybe we can neutralise it at the source.
well, the Apollo is in no condition to get in a battle right now.
that beam took a lot out of our shield.
no, we've gotta do something.
we did do something.
I'm sorry, sir, but I can't help but think that we're somehow responsible for this.
why, because Weir said so?
no, sir.
John, listen to me.
I, uh,
I've been over your record.
I know you have your detractors but personally I think you've done a hell of a job here.
thank you, sir.
you should be running Atlantis, not Doctor Weir.
well, then I'd be the man, and who would I have to rage against?
listen.
because of us,
earth won't have to deal with an armada of replicator ships, so whatever happens here, we did the right thing today.
I'm sorry.
it's just ... they didn't even consult me.
I imagine they felt the need for secrecy was great.
I have the highest level of clearance humanly possible, Teyla. No they're trying to undermine me.
some of the military doesn't like that a civilian - let alone a woman - is in charge of this city.
surely General O'Neill doesn't feel that way.
and the IOA - they've backed you several times. They believe in you.
Yes, when things are going well, but as soon as we run into a major problem, the military steps in and assumes absolute control.
certainly you don't wish to coordinate military attacks.
no, and that's not what I'm saying.
look, our current situation could have easily been avoided.
I told them as much, but they put next to no weight behind my opinions regarding the safety and protection of this city.
Yes, the IOA is happy to have me as lead administrator, but when it comes to the big decisions ...
if we get out of this, I think I may have to step down.
give it some time.
you need to step back and ... - We've got something.
we were throwing some ideas back and forth well, he was throwing them forth and I was throwing them back and while he was droning on about some idea that might have worked, it suddenly occurred to me:
this city has encountered problems like this before, so I ...
we don't need the history of your idea, Doctor.
I'll let that be a surprise when I read your autobiography.
just tell me the plan.
we submerge it.
I'm sorry?
we submerge the city.
I thought you said we couldn't submerge the city.
that was two years ago before the ancients came and activated a number of new systems. See ...
the "how" is complicated, but I think it's possible.
look, it's not a permanent solution ...
... but it'll buy us enough time 'til we come up with one.
exactly.
how much time?
some. As much as a week.
I don't understand. Why?
Ah, you see, the history part would have made that a lot clearer.
had you been a little more patient, - I would have painted you a picture of ... - McKay.
ten thousand years ago when the ancients were under siege from the wraith, they sank the city in order to dissipate the wraiths' energy blasts in the water.
this way, the shield was able to hold far longer than it ever could on the surface.
so, now, we submerge the city.
the water attenuates the satellite's beam intensity - buys us some more shield time.
we cannot predict how much the replicators' beam will be attenuated.
it might not buy us any time at all.
there's no way to know for sure, yes, but it's not a reason not to try.
alright, get it done.
Yeah, I don't think that's your call.
worst case scenario?
we lose some power from the ZeePM?
Oh, no - worst case scenario is that we've both read the numbers wrong, we use up a ton of power and the city doesn't submerge at all.
look, as much as I hate to say it,
Zelenka's not infallible.
still, I agree.
it's worth the risk.
alright. The city has an automatic submersion subroutine already in the system.
give me an hour.
it's been an hour.
we're ready.
no - you've got to do the, um ... - Oh, just, um ...
we are ready.
good.
give me city-wide.
attention all personnel.
we are about to attempt to submerge the city.
from what I understand, it could get a little bumpy, so this is your last chance to secure equipment and get to the designated safe areas.
we've come full circle, eh?
Yeah.
feels that way.
take us down.
aye, aye, Captain.
shall we?
that's it. We're down.
the beam still looks pretty serious, Rodney.
Yeah, I know. Just give me a second to ...
crap!
I told you.
thank you, Radek. Very helpful.
what is it?
the beam is breaking through the water much more efficiently than we thought.
the water has no effect?
it's having an effect but just nowhere near what we wanted to.
look, that plan took us three hours to execute and bought us an additional ...
... ten hours.
nine.
nine.
what's the plan?
that was the plan.
I need to learn some science.
what for?
I'm not all that useful in situations like these.
if we get into a fight, or we need to break out of somewhere, you know, kill someone,
I'm your man;
but a laser attacking the city's shield
I don't know where to chip in.
well, that's why we're a team, like the Fantastic Four.
it's a comic book where superheroes fight crime and stuff.
see, I'd be Mr Fantastic; Ronon would be The Thing;
McKay would be the Human Torch ... ... you'd be the Invisible Woman.
I am not invisible.
no. No, and McKay's not a human torch.
well, how come you get to be Mr Fantastic?
because he was the leader and I'm the ...
I'm just saying that
I'm gonna go check on McKay.
shouldn't you guys be bickering or something?
Ah, we've got nothing to bicker about. He's run out of bad ideas ... finally.
if we survive this, I'm putting in for a transfer.
Oh, please. We both know that you've done your best work under me.
under you?!
I'm my own department head, you know.
please! We both know that department is a joke.
What?!
why don't you two guys just make out and get it over with, huh?
I mean, we have, what?
under one day to figure out how not to get destroyed by this satellite thing, and you guys are arguing about who works for who.
every possible scenario ends in failure.
there is nowhere on the face of this planet that that thing cannot kill us.
you don't think ...? - No.
old girl too banged up?
no, the replicators fixed all the damage we did with the drones.
we just don't have the power.
Yeah, but ideally ...
... it may be the only way. - What?
the drilling platform.
you guys have it operational down there, right?
close enough, but we couldn't bring it with us.
bring it where?
we don't need to. We just need a boost.
you might be onto something here.
Hey! What's your idea?! Hey!
well, luckily the umbilical's already in place.
Yes, I know. Look, are you capable of outputting the power we need or not?
we just started drilling into the crust.
I can get you nine percent of the way there.
there goes that plan.
can't the ZPM make up the difference?
Ah, no. The ZPM's a little busy powering the shield at max.
what if it didn't have to?
what?
what if we could take the strain off the shield momentarily?
well, we'd need about a minute. Why? What do you have in mind?
Lantea's moon has some sizeable satellites itself.
Asteroid-like chunks we think are left over from a second moon that no longer exists.
I'd like you to beam up Lorne and get a flight of F-302s close enough to nudge one our way.
you wanna bring an asteroid towards us?
is that wise?
well, today it is.
alright, guys.
we need to get close enough to clamp on to it.
get enough of us drilled in, we can fly it like a ship ...
it's probably gonna be a real pain in the ass to steer, but a ship nonetheless.
let's take this big gal for a stroll.
flights Three and Four, begin your burn. Full thrust.
son of a bitch!
we might be able to pull this off after all!
flights One and Two, begin your burn.
it's working?
it's slow going, but, uh, yes, they're bringing it towards the planet.
they should be able to get here before our cut-off time.
so we can actually do this?
I think so, yes.
OK, time to tell people.
patch me into the PA, please.
may I have your attention?
as you all know, we have found ourselves in a spot of trouble.
the reality is that no matter where we try to hide on this planet, the replicator satellite will be able to track us.
therefore, Doctor McKay and Colonel Sheppard have come up with a rather ingenious way for us to escape the satellite's range altogether.
in the next few hours, we will fire the city's stardrive and head into space.
Atlantis is leaving this planet.
may I come in?
of course.
all non-essential personnel have been beamed to the Apollo.
good. Good.
has Doctor McKay located your new home yet?
Yes. M12-578.
it's the closest non-populated habitable planet with a large ocean.
he's a bit nervous about trying to land on solid ground.
I can understand that.
listen, I know you don't like me very much ...
Colonel, that's nei ... - That's OK.
to be honest, I'm not that crazy about you either.
but if I've crossed the line here or there in regards to your command,
I apologise. I'm used to making the calls.
but I don't want you to think I don't respect you. I do, Doctor.
thank you.
I appreciate that.
I wish the rest of the military felt the same way.
well, I can't speak to that.
I do know General O'Neill is awfully fond of you.
I'd better be heading out.
good luck.
Thanks.
we're gonna need it.
alright. Zelenka is doing a final pass over all the coding we've done, but so far it's looking good.
the underwater drilling platform's power output has been dialled up as high as it'll go, and the crew down there have been beamed up to the Apollo.
we're gonna wreck that thing, aren't we?
what, the drilling platform? Oh, hell, yes!
but thirty percent of our total power requirements are gonna be consumed in the first ten seconds of flight.
the station will provide us with that power right up until we snap the umbilical, at which point we switch over to the ZPM.
now, if we can interrupt the satellite's beam which is greatly taxing our power levels we should be able to squeeze out just enough power to actually do this thing.
how's Lorne doin'?
he's making good time.
he should be here in the next twenty minutes.
well, I guess it's showtime.
you sure you can do this?
fly the city?
what else could I possibly be talking about?
I flew a V22 Osprey once.
was it as big as a city?
well, you had to use your hands and feet with that one.
this one, you just have to sit down and think ...
fly.
OK, why don't you just get in the chair and start your pre- flight?
Oh, I'm gonna head up to the control room, and Zelenka will monitor output from the ZPM room.
and, uh, good luck.
you too.
doctor McKay, can you read me?
five by five. Lorne, you in position?
we're getting close. You about ready?
Zelenka, I need a go or no go.
we're go. All non-essential systems have been shut down.
we're in the green.
are you ready, Sheppard?
ready as I'll ever be.
OK, Major, make sure she's moving as slow as possible.
are you sure we shouldn't just lob this thing at the satellite?
no, they'd easily be able to navigate back into position.
this is still our best bet.
copy that.
package is away and on course.
we're heading back to the Apollo.
good luck.
OK, calculating travel time based on current speed.
that's it. We're good.
here goes nothing.
asteroid is entering the beam.
we're on the surface. Fire the stardrive.
we're not flying high enough.
it's stalling out!
it's not working.
what are you doing wrong?
sure, blame me. We don't have enough power.
Oh, sure, blame me!
it's not working. What other reasons could there be?
I have no more power to give you!
shut it off.
what?
lower the shield.
we're about to go into space! If you plan on breathing, we're gonna need the shield.
turn it back on at eighteen thousand feet.
we just need the boost to get started, no?
that might work.
OK, I did it. Give it all you've got.
that's it!
we're flying!
that's it. Time's up. Raising the shield.
taking us into hyperspace.
we did it!
I need a medical team to the control room, stat!
multiple injuries!
Keller, what happened?
apparently the beam grazed the tower and blew out the ...
that guy just has a cut. Tell him to put pressure on it and move on.
there's a lot of people worse off upstairs.
is she gonna be ok?
I don't know yet.
she took quite a fall and her pupils are sluggish.
I'm gonna have to get her under a scanner.
I'll know more in a bit.
Oh, God.
are you alright?
Yeah, I've had worse.
how come no-one's helping you?
I told them I didn't need any help. Other people need more.
I doubt that. Get this man to the Infirmary.
Yes, sir.
you guys alright?
all things considered.
what happened?
the beam grazed the side of the tower before the shield was completely closed.
damage?
minimal - I think.
look, I was able to get the shield up fairly quickly. It took the brunt of the blow.
Oh, what now?
what is happening?
we just dropped out of hyperspace.
have we already reached M12-578?
no. There's no way. It should have taken at least another few hours.
the hyperdrive just shut down.
Why?
I don't know.
get it back up.
where are we?
in the middle of nowhere.
there's no planets, no moons, no Stargates.
how much power do we have?
this can't be right.
how much?
at current consumption, we've got twenty-four hours of power left.
after that, there's no shield.
no shield, no atmosphere. No atmosphere, we're ...
can we use the Stargate?
in order to dial a gate, it needs to be calibrated to a specific location.
we are lost.
look, we dropped out of hyperspace way too soon.
I have no idea where we are.
praise the gods, you've finally arrived and you are far more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.
excuse me?
you have not come for the arranged marriage?
no.
would you perhaps be seeking a husband? - No.
then what brings you to our town?
we've heard of strangers who recently arrived a rough-looking group, boasting of many wraith kills?
Yeah, we think they might be satedan.
Ah, yes, you mean the three loud-mouthed drunkards who spend their days carousing at the tavern?
sounds like my people.
thank you. - You are most welcome and should you ever reconsider your desire for a husband...
sounds good
hello
I'm looking for three individuals who recently arrived.
I've heard they are voracious eaters and drinkers, and apparently, they've been quite vocal about their recent successes against the wraith
these people you're looking for...
they're either very brave, or very stupid.
how so?
well if word of their bragging got back to the wraith it could be very bad for them
I doubt they need to fear a wraith overhearing their conversation.
of course not but the wraith don't always need their own ears to hear.
do you know the people whom I seek?
sorry
I mind my own business which is something you might want to consider
and you might want to consider offering your unsolicited advice to someone who actually cares to receive it
an attitude like that could get you hurt or worse
what's the first to go?
the ears, or those pretty eyes?
how about your head?
hmm, heard the rumor?
no, what rumor?
never mind. Forget I mentioned it.
wait. What is this about?
no, it would be irresponsible for me to say anything.
all right, look, if you're going to twist my arm, the I. O.A. Have made their final decision.
they've chosen the new leader of atlantis.
well, who is it?
well, there's been no formal announcement, but word is, they're going with their foremost expert in ancient technology and replicator activity
who does that sound like to you?
you? - Yes. Who else?
well, I heard they were leaning toward someone with a science background
and why not? It's about time that one of us ended up in a position of real power.
Oh, oh, and by "us," you mean "you.
exactly.
it's kind of scary, though.
you know, I'll be making decisions that don't affect just the city, but the entire galaxy.
Yes, scary.
very scary - On the other hand a leader never second-guesses himself.
I'm up for the challenge.
I know I am.
I'm going to make them proud.
Radek, I'm going to make you proud.
the wraith-replicator war is in full swing.
from what I hear, the replicators are kicking some serious ass in their last offensive.
that's good news, john. Well done.
Hey! - I'll have the reports ready for you.
uh... what's new?
just making preparations for the change in command here.
you don't have to tell me. I already know.
Really?
I just want to say that I think the I. O.A. Could not have made a better choice.
Thanks, rodney.
no, no, no, no, you are too kind.
what?
uh... "thank you, rodney.
no, no, wait a minute. You mean the...
reunion
I thought you guys were dead.
believe me, so did we.
how did you manage to survive the wraith attack on sateda?
we weren't there.
I don't understand.
when we first made the decision to fight back against the wraith, we didn't just wait for them to come to us.
we started running ops against some of their known strongholds.
they were quick strikes.
get in, hit 'em hard, get out.
only on this particular occasion, we kind of messed up the getting out part.
I saw the darts hit your position.
what you didn't see was that we'd found a network of caves in the hillside.
when the wraith attacked the entrance collapsed, and we were sealed in.
it took us three days to dig our way out.
and by then, the place was crawling with them.
it was obvious they were gearing up for an attack.
took another two weeks before we could find our way through the gate, and by then...
it was too late.
when we got back to sateda, there was nothing left.
I'm sorry.
I should have never left you behind.
when you took second squad back to the gate, you had no way of knowing those darts were going to come through
and if we'd have gone back with you then we would have died in the attack on sateda along with everybody else.
the only reason why you survived was because they made you a runner.
you heard about that?
a while back, we started hearing stories.
they said you were seven feet tall and had the strength of five men.
people like to exaggerate.
they also said you killed a hundred wraith.
that part sounds about right.
well, then...
to the misery of our enemies and the reunion of friends come back from the dead.
Oh, yeah.
on the day I left chulak master bratac said to me "draw from your past but do not let your past draw from you.
that's good advice.
still, I know I'm going to miss this place, and all of you.
I would have been offended had you felt otherwise.
10 years is a long time.
it has been 10 years well spent.
we have defeated numerous enemies and overcome many threats.
it was never dull.
we have accomplished much here but now it is atlantis that is in need of you.
yeah...
part of me is looking forward to going, but...
you know, there's a part of me that thinks maybe it's too soon, that I'm leaving my work here unfinished.
your work will continue only in a different place
you have been bestowed an incredible honor, colonel carter, and I believe you should embrace it.
and know this...
though we may not be leaving with you, sg-1 will never be far away.
so I can expect you guys to come and visit sometime?
undomesticated equines could not keep me away.
nice call-back.
indeed
all right.
time to go.
what's that?
it's a selection of fruits from the various worlds we trade with.
I thought it'd be thoughtful.
try lame.
really, and what would you suggest?
you know, maybe some flowers.
you could brighten up her quarters.
Oh, flowers.
here, take this, and go.
Colonel carter welcome to atlantis.
thank you.
it's nice to be here.
I want you all to know how honored I am to accept this appointment.
I've come here fully committed to this expedition, to atlantis, and most importantly, to each and every one of you.
I look forward to working with all of you.
thank you.
nice speech.
thank you.
I also do weddings and award shows.
book early to avoid disappointment.
should we go check out your new digs?
yeah
stings, doesn't it?
what the hell have the three of you been doing all these years?
Oh eating, drinking killing wraith
we've hit 'em more times than I can count.
racked up a pretty nice body count.
not to mention the 12 darts we've downed.
we're armed, mobile, and, occasionally, get good intel.
well, sounds like a pretty nice run.
but there have been a few sacrifices.
yeah? What do you mean?
there were five of us who came out of that cave alive...
but we lost marika on the first assault against the wraith and then hemi last year.
it hasn't been easy.
we don't have much to work with, but we make do.
sometimes, it's not enough.
Yeah, well, I might be able to help.
we've got the manpower, the equipment.
my friends and I, we can...
anyway, um...
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
to marika and hemi.
thank you
Hey, rodney. Come on in.
I brought you a little something to spruce up the place.
well, thank you. That's very sweet.
there's a vase right there.
Oh, colonel sheppard dropped that off.
apparently, it's a sampling of fruit from the home worlds of our various trading partners.
I thought it was a really thoughtful gesture.
son of A...
anyway look, I just... I just came by to welcome you to atlantis, see how you're settling in, and you know, if you needed anything, and did I mention I was seeing someone?
I'm sorry, what?
I'm, uh, seeing someone.
Yes, I only bring it up now because you're here now and we'll be working together a lot more, and our past?
well, you know, the unrequited lust that's been hanging over our heads for what seems like forever.
I just don't want things to be awkward between the two of us, you know?
kind of like they are now.
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Oh, of course. I mean, I'll be fine. I'm just...
with you... - I hear you're in charge.
Ronon, this is colonel carter. Sam, this is ronon. He's
satedan and a member of your team. Of course.
what can I do for you?
I want to bring some friends to atlantis, and, apparently, I've got to clear it through you first.
unfortunately, some new security procedures prevent me from allowing any off-world visits to atlantis for the time being.
on whose authority?
it was a directive from the I. O.A.
well, they don't need to know.
Ronon, she's
I'm sure you understand what a precarious position we're in here.
it is imperative that the location of this base remain a secret.
and it will.
they're my people. I'll vouch for them.
I'm sure you can, but for now, we're on a new planet with a new set of rules.
and a new person in charge.
Weir never would've doubted me.
okay, first of all, ronon,
I'm not doubting you.
these new regulations apply to everyone on this base, and secondly...
I'm not dr. Weir.
is he always like that?
no, no...
no, actually, you caught him on a good day.
try it together, and turn!
work on it.
well, that was fast.
Yeah, I said it would be.
you could have taken your time.
we like it here.
we're thinking of staying on a few more days.
then where will you go?
wherever
that's one of the nice things about not being tied down.
you go where you want, and you leave when you're not wanted.
Yeah, well, I was hoping my people would show a little bit more hospitality, but...
don't worry about it.
I understand.
not everybody gets an invitation to atlantis.
don't look so surprised.
you travel as much around this galaxy as we do and sooner or later, you'll start hearing rumors about new people in the city of the ancients and the runner who joined 'em.
man, I'm sorry.
I wish I could've been straight with you from the start.
they placed their trust in you, and you proved them worthy.
I wouldn't have expected any less.
Yeah, but still-- - what you thought they'd make an exception because it was you asking?
I'm supposed to be their friend-- - no.
you're their ally.
their guest.
me, rakai, and ara, we're your friends.
I don't doubt they're good people.
they helped you out when you needed it and from what I hear, they've done more to hurt the wraith than anyone.
you've got to respect that but it doesn't mean you've got to commit to them.
the way I see it, now that we're back together...
you belong with us.
pretty impressive, isn't it?
to be honest, it's a little overwhelming.
coming from somebody with your record, that says something.
you know, john, your name was on the short list.
Yeah, I know.
I saw what they did to elizabeth, the politics and the red tape. I didn't envy her.
I don't envy you.
Thanks.
you know, for most of us, this thing with elizabeth isn't over yet.
she's still out there.
you really believe there's a chance she's still alive?
there's only one way to know for sure.
we should have done it sooner but the I. O.A.'S been stonewalling me.
now that you're in charge, maybe you can give me the green light.
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous.
it's no more dangerous than the last time we went in.
circumstances were different. Plus, you had an advantage then that you don't have now.
well, she's the one who gave us that advantage.
the only reason we're here is because of what she did.
believe me, I know and I don't like the idea of leaving someone behind any more than you do but I'm not about to send you or anyone else on a suicide mission.
now, you come to me with a plan that has an even an outside chance of succeeding and I'll consider it.
short of that, john, I'm sorry.
there's nothing I can do.
fair enough.
you seem distracted today.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
what's wrong? - There's nothing. I told you, I'm fine.
very well. I suppose we should just continue training.
there's nothing!
okay, stop hitting me!
God... I'll talk.
I'm thinking of leaving atlantis.
where would you go?
must it come down to a choice between atlantis and your satedan friends?
they're more than my friends, teyla. They're my family.
we've always been there for each other.
you wouldn't understand.
I disagree.
leaving my fellow athosians for a home here on atlantis was a very difficult decision.
I was their leader.
for some the only leader they'd ever known and despite the fact that I was as close as a trip through the stargate there were moments when I felt I'd betrayed them.
so what? You got over it? - No.
I sometimes still second-guess my decision then I remember that I can do more here to help my people and the rest of humans in this galaxy than I ever could on my home world.
Teyla's already spoken to you, hasn't she?
Yeah, well, we had a little chat.
so let's hear it.
hear what?
whatever you've got to say.
not going to say anything. - Really?
I don't have to, because you already know what I'm going to tell you.
that you're a valuable member of my team and that it would be difficult to find somebody to take your place.
and that you may think you're going back to find something you've lost, but there's nothing to go back to.
you're not going to say any of that?
I don't have to.
look, this isn't about me trying to bring back the past.
well, then what is it?
they need me.
they always have.
I'm the one that took care of them, got them home alive whenever we went into battle.
you're one man, ronon.
you can't expect to protect them forever.
probably not...
but that's where you guys come in.
we got some intel on araith target.
the wraith and the replicators are kind of beating the crap out of each other right now.
I think it's counter-productive to run an op against them.
I have a feeling you'll change your mind once you hear the details.
let's hear it.
not yet.
you want to hit a wraith lab?
no offense, but that's awfully close to
it's a weapons research facility.
from what we've heard, the place is undermanned
we know the wraith are being attacked on several fronts.
they don't have the resources anymore to properly guard all their facilities.
still, she did say, "undermanned" rather than "unmanned.
there is a big difference.
it won't matter. We can handle it.
then why do you need our help to pull it off?
we don'T.
but we will need your help to get away once we're done.
I see.
we're your designated drivers.
this is our target.
it's located a good half day's journey from the gate on foot.
having a ship would make things a whole lot easier getting us in and out before any reinforcements arrive.
don't worry. All you got to do is fly.
we'll do the legwork.
well, that's very considerate of you, but if we commit, we're all in.
and I really don't see why we would.
I mean, sure it would be great to get our hands on some new wraith tech, but maybe if we stumbled across a stockpile, or maybe bought some off of ebay, but
I think what he's trying to say is, we're not really sure if we want to risk our lives for something like this.
maybe wait a month or two let the replicators and the wraith soften each other up then we do lunch, we talk about it again.
one of the things they're working on right now in the lab is a way to switch off the replicator attack code.
is such a thing even possible?
the wraith may have done it the first time.
well, we can't let it happen.
no.
if the war with the replicators ends, then the wraith will once again be able to direct their attention to the rest of the galaxy.
so...
are you in?
your buddies seem like a perfectly capable enough bunch but if I do this, the last thing I need is someone going off half-cocked and risking this op and, well, oh, yeah, our asses.
this isn't their first time doing this, john.
may be the first time doing it with company though, and I don't want it turning into a big pissing match
Yeah, well, I'll keep my group in line. Do the same for yours.
last time I checked, it was your group, too.
yeah...
look, I was going to wait to tell you this, but I've made my decision.
once we finish this op
I'm going to be leaving atlantis.
come on in.
packing?
yeah
you know, the fact that you brought all this stuff here tells me that you considered atlantis home that you were happy here
Yeah, well, I was.
I am.
your friends are worried about you.
well, they shouldn't be. I can take care of myself.
that's not the point.
when you accepted the offer to join atlantis, you became a part of something and, like it or not, you have roots here now people who care about you, who depend on you
walking away may be a lot harder than you think.
Oh, I'm not walking away.
just because I'm not a part of sheppard's team does not mean
I'm any less willing to help out atlantis, or put my life on the line for any of you.
I'm not questioning your loyalty, ronon, only the wisdom in leaving, if, as you say, you don't want to turn your back on atlantis.
coordinating our efforts with you and your friends may not be so easy.
we're about to find out, aren't we?
I need you to reconsider your decision to leave.
and if I don't, given everything that I know about atlantis you going to try and stop me?
I'm hoping it won't come to that.
put us down near the south end.
we'll meet less resistance if we access this place through the back.
got it.
once we head in, we'll take the lead.
you watch our backs.
do you know where you're going?
our target is located somewhere on the second level.
uh, maybe you could be a little more specific?
we don't have an exact floor plan, if that's what you're asking.
the whole second level is a high-security sector.
if you are unsure, would it not be counter-productive for us to follow you?
it's better this way.
these wraith facilities are very confusing.
we know what we're looking for.
Oh, and we don't?
this isn't exactly our first op, you know.
really.
how many wraith have you killed in hand-to-hand combat?
I hardly think that's what this is about.
that's what I thought. - You know, we've taken out entire hive ships, okay?
compared to us, you are amateurs.
easy.
if we can't play nice together, then let's not.
we got a lot of ground to cover in a short amount of time, so we will follow your lead then we'll split up into two teams once we reach the second level.
are you cool with that?
yes
good
approaching target location.
this is it.
hurry up!
I got it.
everybody in.
we'll go this way. You go that way.
contact us if you find anything.
yeah
good luck.
let's go.
what do you think?
test subjects? Or the wraith version of a vending machine.
I hate to be the guy to say it, but we can't really help these people.
we got to keep moving.
right
this thing's been way too quiet and way too easy.
I kind of like quiet and easy. Makes for a nice change.
wraith!
Ronon, wait!
Rodney, get that door open!
the hell with it.
Aw, come on, it worked for him!
Hah! I did it!
Oh, thank god, it's you three.
they got teyla and sheppard, and
bring him.
who's the amateur now?
Ronon, what happened?
I need to talk to colonel carter right away
John, are you all right?
bit of a hangover.
the fact that ronon and his buddies aren't here is a good sign.
not really.
ronon's buddies are the reason we're here. They set us up.
what are you talking about?
I ran into them while I was trying to esc
while I was effecting a strategic retreat.
they stunned me.
are you sure?
it's pretty hard to misinterpret something like that.
was ronon with them?
I didn't see him.
that one.
hold on, here, guys.
stay strong, rodney!
I'll try.
I said, I'm fine.
I tried to radio sheppard, but got no response from him, teyla, or mckay.
and what about the satedans?
we got separated.
I'm guessing the wraith got to them, too.
so much for this op being a cake-walk.
okay we've gone from support to rescue and recovery.
Dr. Zelenka, ready a jumper
Yes, colonel.
they'll be expecting us.
make that two jumpers.
would you guys mind telling me where we're going?
seriously, I'm not big on surprises.
even as a kid, I had to sneak a peek at my christmas presents because I couldn't stand the suspense.
I remember this one time-- - we require your assistance.
with what?
you tampered with the replicator base code.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, I may have made a few small adjustments. So what?
this is not the first time they have challenged us.
so it was the wraith that deactivated the attack code.
many thousands of years ago.
we had defeated the ancients. The galaxy was ours, and then these...
things appeared.
I take it you're not a big fan-- - they are an abomination!
they're not even alive.
in other words, you can't eat them, so they're no good to you.
they are machines.
machines can be reprogrammed.
okay, fine, so, what do you want from me?
we have attempted to upload the deactivation virus once again.
our attempts have been unsuccessful.
we need you to undo the changes you made so as to render the virus once more effective against them.
of course. I see.
things is, that could be kind of tricky.
the test subject will make things easier for you.
test subject?
a replicator.
Oh, my god.
I've thought about it, and I want you to know that when the time comes,
I'll respect whatever decision you make regarding your future with us.
this could be the one and only op we go on together.
then we'd better make the most of it.
Dr. Mckay...
how is your work progressing?
it's been kind of slow.
I mean, re-establishing the base code's original setting isn't something I'll be able to accomplish overnight.
Colonel sheppard and teyla will be most disappointed to hear this.
I'll see to it.
I think I might be able to get it finished much sooner.
I understand your desire to delay in the hope that it will give your people time to mount a rescue.
in fact, I've just received word they're on their way, but we are ready for them.
okay, they're moving away.
thank you, jumper two.
take us in, lieutenant.
Yes, colonel.
let's go, let's go!
there's a power relay behind this wall here.
you all right? - Well, it's about time.
any longer, we would've had to save ourselves.
did ronon manage to make it back to atlantis?
he did. - Where is he?
we split up to cover more ground.
secure the entrance. Let's go.
all right, come on, let's get out of here.
where are you holding them?
why don't you ask your friends? [
all clear.
all clear? You could've shot me!
Oh, no.
Oh, no...
let's go find ronon.
deal with him.
you're wraith-worshipers?
Ronon, you need to understand that-- - after what they did to sateda!
sateda is gone and so are the lives we knew.
we had a choice to die with the past, or live for the future.
what did they do to you?
they rewarded us with the gift of everlasting life.
the same gift can be yours, if you're willing to accept it.
we resisted at first, we were stubborn, but the wraith were determined.
they showed us our futures.
they allowed us to experience our life's end, pushing us to the brink so that we could see the truth, and brought us back
they showed us again, and again, and again...
until they broke you.
until we finally accepted the truth and their gift join us.
you're insane
don't let your pride get in the way.
like marika and hemi.
they didn't die on any run, did they?
they were murdered because they wouldn't turn.
they were killed by their own stubbornness.
don't make the same mistake.
join us! - No.
never.
run. You run.
run, and get away while you can, because the next time we meet, it will not be as friends.
there won't be a next time.
we'll finish this like true satedans.
you are not satedans!
rakai, no!
so much for honor.
no weapons.
hasn't there been enough killing?
huh? 
Ronon, where are your friends?
they're right here.
let's go home.
is that my painting?
Yes.
Rodney felt that you should have it back.
I didn't give it to him.
well, he helped himself, assuming that you were leaving it behind.
how you feeling?
all right
it's nice to have you back.
thanks
Hey, is anyone there?
look, I need some help in here!
all right, look.
I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that.
you need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering who tied you to the desk.
well, the truth is, it was you.
I mean, me.
I did it because I needed you to get this message.
it would take too long to give you the full explanation, and you wouldn't remember it anyway, so you're just going to have to trust me on this.
now, you'll find a knife taped to the underside of your chair.
find it, and cut yourself loose.
now...
I need you to listen.
it is vitally important that you find this woman.
I don't know where she is, but you have to find her.
she can help.
check the mess hall, or maybe they took her to the brig, I don't know.
you just have to keep looking.
don't worry about anything else, and for god's sake, don't trust anyone.
just find her and do it fast, because if you don't, hundreds of people are going to die.
including you.
14 hours earlier
Hey, what are you doing here?
well, I heard you were back, and I hadn't seen you for a while, so
Yeah, I know. We have this whole new mainland to explore, and I've been bringing back samples all week.
so I see. Anything interesting?
well, it's all pretty similar to what we found back on lantia.
we found a few new species.
Oh, which reminds me, I've got a surprise for you.
I found this guy hiding in some shrubbery.
what is that?
well, it doesn't have a name yet, but I'm thinking of calling it...
after you.
Really?
What...you can do that?
Yeah.
be careful.
the bristles will pierce skin.
anyway, look, I wondered if I could...
you know, tear you away from all this long enough to have some lunch?
Oh, I would-I would love to, but...
I think I'm coming down with something.
I have a headache, and I've had a few dizzy spells, so I was thinking of going down to the infirmary.
Oh, uh...
well, I'll come with you.
Oh, no, rodney, you don't have to do that.
I know how much you hate being around sick people.
no, really, it's fine.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Thanks.
after you.
Dr. Brown...
I see you've brought my number one patient.
what? Oh, no, we're not here for me this time. I'm-I'm here for her.
Oh, okay, well, what can I do for you?
well, I've got this really bad headache that won't go away, and I feel kind of dizzy.
when did you first notice it?
some time this morning. Why?
well, because you're the fourth person to come in here with those exact symptoms, and the second person from the botany department.
hey...
who's that?
gerald Baxter. He's on my team.
you've met him before.
he's got the bug collection?
Oh, sure, right, yeah.
I remember now.
well, I'm going to need to take some blood.
you, too, doctor.
what?
if there is something going around, you might have been exposed to it as well.
sorry.
major Dorsey and his team just returned from m6r-214.
they examined the debris field above the planet and found the parts from one, possibly two, replicator ships.
it was just a matter of time before the wraith got organized and started hitting back.
I suppose.
they did defeat the ancients, after all.
the replicators may look like the ancients, and they may use the same technology, but they're going to be a lot tougher to put down.
Colonel Carter, come in, please.
go ahead, doctor.
I've got a situation developing.
be advised I've imposed a quarantine on the entire infirmary level.
what's going on?
11 patients have shown up here in the last hour, complaining of headache and dizziness.
eight of them are from the survey teams that just got back from the mainland.
any idea what's wrong with them?
I ran some blood tests and found a bacteria I've never seen before.
I'm checking it against the ancient database.
what do you want us to do?
well, the first thing we need to do is isolate everyone that went to the mainland, and have them report to Dr. Neves in the auxiliary med lab for testing.
will do. Keep us posted.
more test results.
you and I are both infected.
so's Dr. Mckay.
the good news is the most advanced case is still only showing mild, flu-like symptoms.
maybe it won't get any worse than that.
Yeah, let's hope so.
present
Hello?
hey...hey, wake up.
what are you doing here?
I-I don't know.
what are you doing?
you're not a soldier.
if you say so.
you should come with me.
it's safer.
no, slow down.
what's going on here?
it's the soldiers. They're after us.
if they catch us, they'll take us away.
take us where? What soldiers? What is this place?
will you shut up? The soldiers will hear us!
what the hell is going on here?
why can't I remember anything
I don't know. No one can.
no one can?
you've seen others?
Yes, one or two others, apart from the soldiers.
what about her? Was she there?
no.
I have to find her.
Why?
I don't know. It's important.
look, the soldiers probably have her by now, okay?
well, can we ask them?
are you crazy?
if the soldiers see you, they shoot you, take you away.
again with the taking away.
you should come hide with me. It's safe.
I can't, I have to keep looking.
fine, suit yourself.
if you get yourself killed, I don't care.
it started suddenly, and then it just...
just stopped.
okay, well, I appreciate you telling me.
aren't you going to do anything?
to be honest, I don't see how it's relevant.
well, it's a new symptom. I thought it might be important.
I don't see how a "tingling sensation in your knees" relates to this condition, especially since you're the only one experiencing it.
Yeah, but so far.
I'm just saying, we don't know anything about this disease.
look, the best thing for you to do right now is try to relax, okay, and let me do my work.
here you go.
thank you.
what did dr. Keller say?
Oh, she's going to...
take it into consideration.
thanked me for my input and...
how you doing?
I'm okay.
well, dr. Keller's got her team working pretty hard.
I'm sure they're trying a bunch of stuff.
I'm sure they'll come up with a way to beat this thing in no time.
seriously, are you okay?
It'S...my headache.
it's-it's getting worse.
look, is there anything I can do?
could you, uh...
ask the nurse to bring me some tea?
Well...What's wrong with this one?
Oh...
right.
Marie? What's...
what's going on?
I don't know.
I just got really dizzy.
are you telling us that the infection has breached hazmat protocol?
I'm not entirely sure.
it's possible she could have been previously exposed, but that would mean it's already spread much farther among than general population than we thought.
I've got off-duty medical personnel conducting random blood tests around the city just to get a sense of where we're at.
have we confirmed it came from the mainland?
well, the plant and soil samples brought back by the botany department were negative, but it still seems like the most likely point of origin.
what about the database?
I haven't found a match yet, but I'm still looking.
there is one more thing.
since we have no idea what this disease does, or how it's spread, or even if our containment measures are having any effect,
I recommend we suspend all gate travel immediately.
thank you, doctor.
hey...
how you feeling?
I-I don't know.
Oh. Well, they brought dinner.
this salisbury steak's actually quite good.
Oh, and by the way, I asked dr. Keller about your friend, dr. Baxter.
she says he's asleep, but apparently the fever's down.
who?
Dr. Baxter. That's his name, right, the guy on your team?
where am I?
what do you mean? You're in the infirmary. I brought you here, remember?
who are you?
present
Hey!
hold it right there.
I don't want to cause any trouble. I just
Yeah, put him with the others.
get him out of here.
Yes, sir.
8 hours earlier well, what's the word?
well, the random test results came back.
six different people working in six different areas of the city, all positive.
that doesn't sound very promising.
well, it's either a statistical miracle, or the entire base has been exposed.
we're running more tests to confirm it, but it doesn't look good.
I don't know about you, but I feel fine.
well, me too, and that's the problem.
if there is a delay before the first symptoms appear, it could've spread anywhere before we even knew what was happening.
I've informed stargate command that we're suspending gate operations.
Colonel Carter, this is dr. Keller.
go ahead.
I'm sending you scans on Katie Brown, as well three other patients who are beginning to show signs of amnesia.
all of them show large concentrations of affected cells in the medial temporal lobe.
it looks like the bacteria is causing these cells to produce a hormone that interferes with the brain's ability to access episodic memory.
how bad are we talking?
well, rate of deterioration seems to vary from patient to patient, but, in all cases, it looks like it's progressive, meaning, the longer they go without treatment, the worse it gets.
pretty soon, they won't be able to remember their own names.
you said the first symptoms were headaches and dizziness.
Yeah, that's right.
how long after they appeared before the first signs of memory loss?
again, it seems to vary, but you're looking at an average of about six hours.
what about you, doc, showing any signs?
Yeah, the headaches started half an hour ago.
all right, keep searching the database.
it still think it's our best bet to find a solution.
I'd love to, but if we're right about these numbers,
I'm about to get overrun with a lot of new patients.
it's already pretty crowded in here.
mess hall.
we can clear it out and make a temporary ward.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
at the very least, it'll consolidate everyone in one place for treatment.
do it.
are you all right?
Yeah.
where am I?
we were hoping you could tell us.
who are all you people?
we don't know.
none of us can remember anything.
what's happening out there? What did you see?
nothing.
it was just...
empty hallways.
how did I get here?
the soldiers brought you.
Why?
they bring everyone here.
they say it's for our own protection.
don't waste your time.
it won't open.
why are they doing this to us?
look, why can't anyone remember?
my...
the computer.
Where's my computer?
it wasn't with you when they brought you here.
Why?
I have to find someone.
it's a woman.
do you know who that is?
does anyone here know teyla?
anyone?
I thought this city had some sort of automatic lockdown to prevent stuff like this.
it does.
Oh, yeah?
what happened?
you're asking me?
you got a headache?
Yeah, I guess it was just a matter of time.
John? -I'm fine.
Hey.
how you feeling?
I am fine.
any symptoms?
no, none yet.
me neither.
what is it?
how do they know we're all infected?
my blood wasn't part of the sample that was tested.
nor was mine.
even so, it is likely we were exposed.
so? Being exposed doesn't mean you've got it.
maybe it doesn't affect everybody the same way, and all I know is I feel great.
so do I.
perhaps you should make dr. Keller aware of this.
Yeah.
okay.
excuse me.
Dr. Keller...
I need to talk to you.
I'm a little busy right now.
I'm not sick.
well, if you're lucky enough not to be exposed, you just blew it by coming in here.
no, I know I've been exposed.
people I've been working with all day have been getting sick, but I'm not feeling anything.
neither is Teyla.
you think you might have some kind of immunity?
you're the doctor.
okay.
well, I'm going to need a sample of your blood.
take as much as you need.
what are you doing?
I have to remember somehow.
I already feel certain things slipping away.
all right, now what are you doing?
getting out of here.
all right, everyone!
listen up!
I need to escape quickly!
does anyone know how I can do that?
you can't just leave.
why not?
what about the soldiers?
we're just going to have to deal with them.
I'm sorry, call me crazy, but I don't exactly trust them.
that doesn't mean we should be running loose.
we have no idea what's out there.
look, something caused this to happen, all right?
and we're not going to figure it out from in here.
somewhere out there, there is a woman that...
a woman named...
Teyla. - Teyla, right, thank you.
I think she knows something.
what?
I don't know.
we got to get out there and find out.
I think we should listen to him.
Why?
it makes sense.
why haven't the soldiers told us what's happened?
why haven't there been any announcements, or any help on the way?
maybe they don't know any more than we do.
we need a plan.
they let you out?
well, the second set of random blood tests just came back, all positive.
didn't see much point in quarantining the infirmary anymore.
you showing any signs?
headache?
Yeah, same here.
five bucks says you start losing your memories first.
all right, we've got food, water, and blankets.
we don't have enough beds, but we're just going to have to make do.
we may need to think about ordering all non-essential personnel to report to the mess hall.
I mean, they're going to wind up there anyways, and, this way, we won't have people with no memories wandering the hallways.
that's what I'm worried about.
I'll send lorne and a team out, make sure those orders are followed.
these are from dr. Neves.
they're stimulants.
he thinks they may slow the effects of the memory loss.
it's just a stopgap, but at least it may buy us a few hours.
do we know what's in these?
because I'm allergic to a lot of-- -take it.
hand these out to Lorne and his men.
one more thing.
I've ordered dr. Zelanka to remove the gate's main control crystal.
no matter what happens, we cannot risk spreading this disease elsewhere in the galaxy, or to earth.
and what happens when we all start losing our memory?
Dr. Keller will come up with something before that happens.
hey...
I thought we were moving everyone to the mess hall.
he's our most advanced case.
his vitals are too unstable.
what can I do for you?
I was just wondering if you found anything.
what do you mean?
I'm not showing any sign of the disease, remember?
Oh, well, it's possible you could have some sort of natural immunity.
Doc...doc... -I'm going to take a sample of your blood
you've already done that.
it's happening to me, isn't it?
doctor, he's convulsing!
okay, uh...
give him, uh...
m-medazilam, four milligrams.
he's in v-fib. I need a crash cart.
charge it to 200.
clear.
charge it to 300.
clear.
go, go!
stop!
stop!
this way!
okay, I think we're clear.
Oh, thank god.
my lungs were about to give out.
so, what next?
I don't know.
how do we find her?
who?
Teyla. The one we just risked our lives for.
right, right.
I don't know.
all right, we'll just have to search room by room.
I mean, how big could this place possibly be?
where are you taking us?
I already told you. The mess hall.
I don't want to go there.
just relax.
I know you're scared, but you're just going to have to trust me.
it's for your own good.
so much for coming quietly.
hey...
mess hall's this way.
right.
don't look at me that way.
it's easy to get turned around in this place.
major Lorne's picking up some more stragglers.
we're starting to get a little resistance.
Yeah, they're starting to lose their memories.
they probably can't understand why soldiers are after them.
that's why I told him to take his men to the armory and equip them with stunners.
I'm not sure I like the idea of us shooting at our own people.
well, we may not have a choice.
Yeah, I suppose you're right.
pretty soon, there's going to be some panicked, confused people out there.
okay, carry on.
what?
come with me.
you might want to go easy on that stuff, major.
sir, we need to delay this thing as much as possible.
if we all go, there's no coming back.
Yeah, I know.
that's what I want to talk to you about.
I got an idea.
didn't we come this way before?
no.
are you sure?
no.
I have an idea.
what are you doing?
if we come back here, we'll know we've been this way before.
presuming of course that we remember that we're the ones who put it there in the first place.
I know you're out there.
drop your weapons and come out slowly.
little guy with glasses.
what are you doing?
Hey, I know him.
don't shoot.
I don't have any weapons.
who are you?
we were captured by the soldiers.
we escaped.
Really?
wait a second.
what is that?
I found it.
let me see.
what is it?
I don't know, but something tells me it's important.
Why?
I don't know.
Hey, how did you know to do that?
I don't know. I just did.
well, that's her, teyla.
you know her?
well, not exactly.
we're looking for her. We think she can help us.
it says,"find her."
how are we going to do that?
this is what I wanted to show you.
this is the bacteria that is causing our disease?
not exactly, but it's very similar.
and you found this in the database?
I stopped looking in the database.
I knew there was a reason why teyla and ronon are the only people who've tested negative so far, and we don't have a lot of information on the satedans, so I started looking through dr. Beckett's records on the athosians.
this is a blood sample taken from a 10-year-old boy.
he was suffering from something called, um...
I wrote it down.
kirsan fever?
Yeah, that's it.
it is a common childhood ailment throughout the galaxy.
I had it when I was eight.
I had it when I was 10.
but this cannot be the same disease.
kirsan fever does not affect adults, nor does it cause memory loss.
well, that may be true, but the structure of the bacteria is too similar to ignore.
they have to be related somehow.
wait a minute.
maybe they are the same.
that would explain why the sensors didn't identify it as a threat.
how is that possible?
well, think about it.
I mean, this planet didn't have a stargate until we came here.
maybe when the ancients were first scouting this place, they accidentally brought this, uh...
kirsan fever with them.
it got trapped here, and over the course of 10, 000 years, it mutated to cause the symptoms we're now experiencing.
that would also explain why you and ronon aren't affected.
you have antibodies built up from when you were young.
well, if they have the antibodies, then-- it would take months to reverse-engineer a cure.
I mean, I'm not even sure it's possible.
the sap of the enchuri plant.
my people have used it for generations to combat kirsan fever.
it is highly effective and not much is needed.
let's go get some.
take a jumper.
wait a minute.
you disabled the gate, remember?
you ordered dr. Zelenka to take the control crystal.
where did he put it?
Zelenka, this is sheppard, come in.
check out the rooms down there and there.
I want this section cleared out in 10 minutes.
Lorne, come in.
Yes, sir. Go ahead.
have you seen zelenka?
as a matter of fact, I have.
did you bring him to the mess hall?
uh, sorry, sir, but he gave us the slip.
must have heard us coming.
cracked one of my people over the head with a metal rod and disappeared down a service hatch before I could get a shot off.
there's no telling where he is now.
Zelenka, respond.
Zelenka, come in.
Radek, we are not trying to hurt you.
we need your help.
okay, this is pointless.
look, we don't even know if he still has a radio, and even if we find him, chances are, he's not going to remember what he did with the control crystal.
let's face it, we're screwed.
there's gotta be some way out of this.
what about the jumpers? They got DHDs.
without the control crystal, the gate can't establish a stable wormhole.
we're not going anywhere.
I'm missing something.
I can't concentrate.
what about the mainland?
ronon is right.
the enchuri plant is abundant on many worlds.
it may be here as well.
all right.
assuming we can find the stuff, how are we going to distribute it?
I'll figure something out.
I'll stay with rodney.
do you know what to look for?
grows like a weed on sateda.
it's, uh...right there.
you can fly this thing.
it's in your blood.
literally.
wait a second...
what am I doing?
you said the quickest way to spread the cure was to aerosolize it and distribute it through the ventilation system.
you are currently attempting to override base protocol for temperature, humidity, and air pressure.
Right...right, okay, it's easy.
just a simple matter of accessing the root directory, and
Aw, come on!
no, no, no, no. I should be able to do this in my sleep.
Oh, god...
it's happening to me too, isn't it?
you have to remain calm.
my memory was lousy to start with.
I mean, people's names, birthdays.
I once forgot mother's day five years in a row.
what is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter?
well, that's pi. It's 3. 14159265, et cetera, et cetera.
that doesn't count. That's easy.
you are a scientist, Rodney.
that is what you care about.
that is what you will hang on to the longest.
right.
right, so...
wait a minute.
doesn't that make me a really bad person?
it makes you the type of person who is going to save all our lives.
Oh, okay.
what is this place?
I don't know.
looks like they left in a hurry.
she's not here. Let'...
down here! This way!
quiet! Go, go.
all right, everybody, spread out.
they got to be in here somewhere.
sir!
found 'em.
good.
let's go. Let's move out, come on.
can we get out of here, please?
what is it?
I have an idea.
come on.
let's go.
wait a minute.
what is this place?
the mainland.
what are we doing here?
I told you already.
we need to get that plant.
something seems fishy.
never gets old.
sorry, buddy. You're just going to slow me down.
how's it coming, rodney?
I'm just about finished.
I think.
what was that?
I will go see.
keep working.
don't move!
major Lorne.
it's me, teyla.
you shouldn't be out here.
major, it's me.
everyone's been ordered back to the mess hall.
but dr. Mckay and I
put your hands on your head.
slowly.
Oh, god...
all right, let's get her up.
come on...
all right.
look, I know you're probably panicking right now, but there is no time for that.
you need to focus.
I'm sure you're wondering who tied you to the desk...
you're awake.
major lorne, you must set me free
you're not going anywhere till I get some answers.
I need to know what you've done to my people.
what I've done?
you believe I'm behind this?
is it a drug?
some kind of bio-weapon?
major, they're sick.
you as well.
the entire base is infected with a disease.
everyone except you.
Yes.
I'm immune to its effects.
isn't that convenient?
how many of those have you taken?
why don't you just let me worry about that, okay?
it's the pills.
they're what's making you act like this.
they're confusing you.
they're making you unstable.
making me unstable?
I'm not the one who unleashed a disease on my people, okay?
quit stalling.
I want to know what you were doing in the hall
Yes.
it's good to see you.
Colonel carter, dr. Zelenka, you as well.
how did you find me?
uh, well, we were having trouble finding you by ourselves, so we followed him.
did you finish your work?
W-what do you mean?
can you disarm the force shield?
I-I don't know.
quickly.
don't move.
drop it.
now back away.
now...
tell me...
who the hell are you?
I know you don't remember everything.
you have no idea what's going on.
you're confused, maybe even a little scared.
I know I would be.
but you have to trust me.
we're friends.
the things we've been through together...
I don't care what anyone says, no disease can wipe that away.
not completely.
okay, deep down, you know I'm telling the truth.
now, give me the gun.
Oh, nice try.
for all I know, you're the one who tied me up.
fine.
then shoot me, and you'll be all alone in the middle of a dark forest with no idea who you are, where you're going, or what you're going to do next.
how could I possibly make it any worse?
that's a good point.
here.
sit.
are you sure you wouldn't rather do it?
I do not know how.
Oh, and I do?
Yes.
you created the override program.
you said you were almost finished.
Oh, then it should be easy.
Rodney, listen to me.
you must do this.
it is our only chance.
the knowledge is inside you.
you just have to find it.
program Complete
he did it.
when I said I was almost finished, I-I guess I wasn't kidding.
now what?
well, now we just have to hope that colonel sheppard and ronon completed their side of the mission.
right.
who?
what is it?
a ship. Headed for the bay doors on the roof.
have they identified themselves?
no, sir.
it could be help.
it could also be some kind of an attack.
get in touch with the others. Tell them to meet me at the jumper bay.
and find major lorne!
nice flying.
Thanks.
come on, help me with this stuff.
we got to get this to teyla right away.
who?
come on.
hands in the air. Now.
listen, lieutenant, this is medicine.
we need to deliver it.
I said, hands in the air.
let's take them to the brig.
you're making a mistake.
there are sick people who need that.
you sure you know what you're doing?
what the hell is going on here?
sir, we caught these men trying to infiltrate the base.
Lorne, you have got to listen to me.
everybody on this base is going to die if you don'T.
and who are you?
look in your pocket.
what?
just look in your vest pocket.
you took a picture of him just in case it came to this.
I was there.
he's telling the truth.
this is our commanding officer.
that's right.
I am your commanding officer.
so...
you should do what I say.
Yes, sir.
what are your orders?
do what he says.
gun.
follow me.
Colonel, you're awake.
what happened?
Teyla distributed the plant through the ventilation system.
knocked you out for a bit.
how long have I been asleep?
about a day.
a day?
hit some people harder than others.
how are you feeling, john?
how's your memory?
Oh, pretty good, I think.
I mean...
things are a little fuzzy.
if I forget your birthday next year...
I will forgive you.
when you are feeling well enough, major lorne wishes to speak with you.
he feels badly about what happened.
it wasn't his fault.
just glad he still had the photo I gave him.
that was good thinking, by the way.
Yes. If the distribution of the cure had been delayed any longer, many more people would have died.
what do you mean?
Where's mckay?
you should get some sleep.
it's okay. I'm...fine.
I can let you know when she wakes up.
I'm going to stay.
okay.
she's not giving up, you know.
she's a fighter.
doctor!
she's moving her fingers.
hey...
where am I?
you're in the infirmary.
you're safe.
do you remember anything?
it's good to see you.
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.
are you ready?
they're preparing to dial the gate.
Yeah, almost finished.
I know, I'm terrible at packing.
I never know how much to bring.
we are only going overnight.
I'm sure you have enough.
well, you'd think so, but...
you seem nervous.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
well, maybe a little.
going off-world is still kind of new to me.
whole other galaxy and meeting new civilizations...
my people are very welcoming and they're eager to meet you.
well, I'm eager to meet them, too, learn about their culture and their history.
a gesture for which they will be most grateful.
it's just...
I know they were very fond of carson.
I only hope to make half the impression he did.
what are those?
Oh, lollipops.
for the kids.
makes the check-ups go easier.
you will make a wonderful impression.
whoo, look you at you.
got a date?
please.
you will contact us if you need us?
Oh, we'll be fine.
you kids have fun.
you're going to love the athosians.
I'm going to experience my first tandul feast.
Oh, those are good, but watch out for the...
what do you call it?
roos wine.
roos wine.
tasty stuff, but a hell of a kick.
we really should be going.
have fun, kids.
the settlement is through the woods.
lead the way.
it is some distance. Let me help you with those.
Oh no, no, no, it's okay.
I'm the idiot who over-packed.
I should be the idiot carrying them.
so sheppard was right, huh?
about that hot date tonight?
I didn't think it would be this far.
is it always this quiet?
something is wrong.
Hello?
Hello!
is anybody here?
where is everyone?
I do not know, but they did not leave of their own accord.
are you saying they were attacked?
or culled.
missing
I thought the wraith didn't know about this planet.
that was my understanding as well.
well then, how could they just
what is it?
you know them?
we must leave.
okay.
over here.
the weapons cache is too far.
what?
better to make a run for the gate.
what are you...
what are you looking for?
did you bring a weapon?
no, it's just medical supplies.
don't you have a weapon?
just a knife.
I was coming to visit my people.
I did not believe I would need a gun.
who are those men?
you know them?
I know of them.
the markings on their faces are distinctive to their tribe, but I have never crossed paths with them...
until now.
are they dangerous?
beyond dangerous.
let's go.
are you all right?
I twisted my ankle.
we have to keep moving.
just hang on a sec.
is it broken?
no, I don't think so.
it's probably just sprained.
leave the bag. It's too heavy.
Oh, god, what do we do?
it is too risky to return to the weapons cache.
what weapons cache?
we gave my people guns to protect themselves in the event they were raided.
what...what makes you think that the guns would still there?
wouldn't that be the first thing those guys would steal?
if the bola kai stole them, they would be using them.
but the weapons cache is too far, especially in your condition, and we have no idea how many more bola kai are out there.
our best option is to take out these guards by ourselves.
take them out? What are you talking about?
how are we going to do that?
I don't know yet.
Hey, listen, I am not like you.
I don't know anything about fighting.
just do what I say.
I want to, believe me, but I...
I don't think I can.
you must think otherwise.
what we first need to do is create A...
they're gone.
are you all right?
I'm sorry.
I know this is something for which you are unprepared.
I should be prepared, I know.
unfortunately, I'm afraid things may get worse before they get better.
those guards will alert the others to our situation, and they will hunt us.
the longer we avoid capture, the better our chances.
they will continue to guard the gate, yes, but in time,
Atlantis will realize we are late, and they will send a rescue team.
but we're not due back till tomorrow.
it is therefore critical that we elude capture until then.
what do you need to help your injury?
well, I should probably wrap it, but the ace bandages are in the medical kit.
the kit is on the way to the weapons cache.
hopefully, it'll still be where we...
what is that?
they are summoning the others, gathering them.
the hunt is beginning.
Oh, thank god.
you must move quickly.
I will.
ibuprofen.
helps with the pain and swelling.
Yes, Dr. Mckay uses them frequently, along with antihistamines, antacids, motion-sickness pills...
you forgot the prescription I just wrote him for restless leg syndrome.
I've always been a wimp.
I've got a low threshold for pain.
people often underestimate the level of discomfort they are capable of enduring.
when I was a child, several of us were sent into the woods for 10 days alone.
10 days alone?
it is a rite of passage among my people.
no food, no water.
forced to survive on our own.
none of us believed we could endure it, but all of us did.
I went to summer camp.
there were other kids.
we had cabins.
with beds.
and electricity, and food.
I see.
I didn't even make it three days.
I got homesick, call my parents to come and get me.
the weapons cache?
well, where are the weapons?
I mean, obviously, the bola kai don't have them.
my people must have needed them to fight off the attack, but then why were they not successful?
the bola kai's weapons would have been no match against these.
over there. -What?
there is a blind across the river.
a blind?
for hunting. It is well hidden.
it will provide shelter for the night.
we're going to cross that?
it is the quickest way across.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
my people built it.
it is quite safe.
Oh, I'M...
I'm sure it is. It-it's just...
well, my...
my ankle, and I've also got this inner ear thing.
we call it vertigo, and...
God, look at it!
there comes a point in adversity when fear disappears, leaving only the will to survive.
I know, it's just, I don't think I'm even remotely close to that point.
fine.
stay here then.
Oh, well, wait!
I mean, I...
I'm sure I could...I could climb down and find A...
shallow spot in the river to cross.
I mean, it might take me a little longer-- teyla?
Oh, god...
here we go.
it's perfectly safe...
perfectly safe.
wobbly...
too wobbly...
almost there...
thank you.
come on.
maybe your people managed to make it to the gate and escape.
all of them?
well, I don't know, maybe.
I mean, we haven't found any bodies, right?
from what you've said, I doubt the bola kai would take the time to bury their victims.
no, they do not, because when they are done with their victims, usually very little remains.
what are you telling me, they're cannibals?
are you all right?
Yeah.
stay here.
what? Teyla!
that's one's dead, but...
he's still alive.
we cannot afford to take prisoners.
well, we could...
we could have tied him up and left him in the woods.
then the others would have found him and released him to rejoin the hunt.
I know it is difficult to accept, but the fewer of them, the better our chances at survival.
his hands are tied.
he must have been A...
a prisoner.
he's got a stab wound to his abdomen.
will you get me my medical kit?
we have to leave him.
what are you talking about?
he's one of your people.
he is not athosian.
but his...his clothes...
I have never seen him before.
well, he's obviously not one of them, and if I don't suture his wound, he's going to bleed to death.
more bola kai will be here very soon.
I know, but this won't take long, okay?
please?
I got the bleeding under control.
if the wound doesn't get infected, he should be okay.
it will be dark soon.
stay here with him. I will find the blind.
uh, I-is it far?
no.
did you find it?
Yes.
how is he?
unconscious, but stable.
can he be moved?
Oh, I don't know.
he shouldn't be.
his condition's precarious. I would hate to
Yes, he can be moved.
water from the river.
thank you.
I have laid traps around the perimeter.
if any bola kai come near, hopefully, we will hear them before they discover us.
good.
how's your ankle?
the swelling's not too bad...
and the pain's eased up, thanks to the painkillers.
if you wish to sleep, I can...
[Scuttling] What?
[Scuttling] What is that?
dinner.
they are attracted to the warmth of our bodies.
the taste leaves much to be desired, but it will sustain you.
Oh, um...
no, thanks, I'm not hungry.
you should eat.
this was my least favorite part of survivor.
he's regaining consciousness.
it's okay.
you're safe now.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
I was planted to work inside the athosian community...
to gather intel.
what happened to them?
dead.
all of them.
who killed my people?
a culling. Entire settlement.
not the bola kai?
bola kai were the ones who told the wraith about them.
the bola kai are wraith worshipers?
I was able to escape during the attack, but I was cut off from the gate.
bola kai were guarding it.
they captured me.
I have never seen you before.
how long have you lived among my people?
I only arrived a few days ago.
where are you from?
she is a friend of mine from another world.
your equipment, it looks ancestral.
we discovered it in our travels.
we have been away for some time, trading.
trading?
with who?
if you are still seeking intel, then you are wasting what few breaths you have remaining.
so say,"thank you for saving me,
and be done with this discussion.
thank you...
for saving me.
you have not slept all night.
with people trying to kill us and creatures crawling around under the ground?
not to mention I'm starving.
not that starving.
it will give you strength.
it'll make me puke.
you do not believe you are capable of eating it, and so you do not.
no, I think it's disgusting, and so I do not.
I have a friend like you, afraid to challenge himself.
I'm not afraid of challenges.
I signed up to be chief of medicine on an expedition in a whole other galaxy.
that's about as challenging as it gets, but eating gross food?
sorry, but that's where I draw the line.
fair enough.
see?
no puking.
yet.
so this friend of yours...
one of your team members?
a certain uptight astrophysicist maybe?
no.
athosian.
his name is Kanan.
a natural leader, but he is unaware of it, burdened by an overly cautious nature.
he's more than a friend, isn't he?
he's the one you were coming to see.
the hot date.
I'm sorry.
it's none of my business.
I should just learn to shut up.
we have known each other since childhood, but only recently kindled more than a friendship.
I have not told anyone yet.
I'm so sorry.
we need more water.
[SCREAMS] We have to leave.
what happened?
can you walk?
I don't even think he can stand.
very soon, many more bola kai will be here.
it's all right.
I can walk.
Mr. Freeze, no, king tut.
wrong on both. Otto Breminger was mr. Freeze.
Victor Buono was king tut.
Vincent price was egghead.
egghead, right.
okay, so, Cliff Robertson?
Oh, I know this one. Played the cowboy, right?
Hey.
Teyla and Keller get back?
I haven't heard from them yet.
they're late.
that doesn't sound like teyla.
no, it doesn'T.
well, she had that big feast last night.
maybe she did a little too much celebrating, and needs to sleep it off.
Yeah, that sounds like teyla.
let's give her a call.
what is? -Cliff robertson.
the villain he played, shame.
very good. Shelley winters.
what the hell are you talking about?
I need to rest.
he is slowing us down, and he is making your ankle injury worse.
well, if we leave him behind, the bola kai are going to capture him.
if we continue this way, we will all be captured.
look, I'm the first to admit I'm not very good at certain things.
I'm not athletic, I can't cook, you don't even want to hear me try to play the piano, but I do think I'm a pretty good judge of character, and I know that you would never sacrifice an innocent man, not even if he was a complete stranger, to save yourself, which means the only reason you would even suggest it would be because of me.
I brought you here.
this is my responsibility.
if anything should happen to you
I signed up for this, all right?
all of it.
I may not have had any idea what I was getting into, but that makes me no different from anybody else on atlantis.
I'm glad you feel that way...
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.
before this is all over, I'm going to have to find all the courage I can muster.
actually...
you're going to need to find it right now.
Oh, god.
Teyla, this is atlantis, do you read?
Teyla, this is sheppard, come in.
she wouldn't turn off her radio.
no, she wouldn'T.
calling anyone in the athosian settlement, this is lieutenant colonel john sheppard.
do you copy?
Teyla, this is sheppard, please respond...
what are they going to do to us?
they will try to extricate information.
we must tell them nothing.
Dr. Keller, the lives of everyone in atlantis are at stake.
I know.
I'm sorry.
where are you from?
what?
your home?
Chippewa falls, wisconsin.
a little town.
do you have any family?
just my dad.
my mom died a few years back.
I'm sorry.
you must miss him.
I'm all he's got left.
then you must do everything you can to survive, to return home.
you must...
you will survive.
you will return home. Do you understand?
who are you?
I am athosian.
I don't believe you.
I do not care what you believe.
the longer you are silent, the worse it will be for you.
I told you.
we are athosian, and you will suffer for what you have done to our people.
what we've done?
you murdered them, an entire village.
that village was deserted when we arrived.
deserted because it was culled by the wraith, wraith who were brought here by you.
do you know who we are?
you are bola kai.
then you know we are hunted by the wraith like everyone else.
unless you are wraith worshipers.
get her out of here!
I'm willing to spare her life if you tell me who you are.
did you tell them anything?
they said they would kill you.
you told them about atlantis?
no.
I...
I gave them a gate address, an uninhabited planet, just to throw them off, buy us more time, like you said.
I don't think they're wraith worshipers.
that guy in there, he seemed genuinely surprised when you accused him of working with the wraith.
why would he deny it if it was true?
I would think that would provide an even more effective threat to get us to talk.
so they just happened to arrive here moments after the settlement was culled?
I find that a coincidence.
something just came through the portal, a flying ship of some kind, but it disappeared before we could do anything.
you two, watch them.
the rest of you, get your weapons and come!
not much longer.
those guys guarding the gates certainly don't look athosian.
they're bola kai.
what? -It a warrior tribe.
ruthless. They like picking fights, especially with tribes who are peaceful.
great, just what we need, another bad guy.
don't worry.
they're primitive. We can handle them.
define primitive.
clubs and arrows.
Hey, arrows can hurt.
only if you're stupid enough to get hit in the ass with one.
life signs?
all over the place. Mostly in the woods.
it's hard to get a visual from up here.
all right, we'll have to go on foot then.
gear up, boys.
if these guys want a fight, happy to give it to 'em.
move back.
where did you get the gun?
the athosians were not the only ones with a hidden cache of weapons.
the bola kai captured me before I could get to mine.
we need to get moving.
they no doubt heard the gunfire.
they coming?
it does not appear so.
I believe it is safe to rest.
thank you for coming for us.
you saved my life.
I figured I'd return the favor.
I thought you were dead.
well, I can't die yet.
I have far too many questions I need answers to first.
we can start with you giving me the gate address to atlantis.
I've got lifesigns, there, there, there, and there.
that really narrows it down.
that way.
Really? Why?
no reason.
good enough for me.
let's go.
why are you doing this?
just give me the address and I'll let you go.
I promise.
I see you're not as badly wounded as I thought.
Oh, it's bad.
I just have a high tolerance for pain.
the address, and I'll let you go, both of you.
you're lying.
you're not genii, are you?
we have an understanding with them.
they wouldn't need to resort to these tactics in order to contact us.
all right, so that part wasn't true, but I was captured by the bola kai.
you're the wraith worshiper.
you're the one responsible for the death of the athosians.
unless I lied about that as well.
what do you mean, they're not dead?
give me the gate address, and I'll gladly tell you everything.
don't move.
untie me.
get out of the way.
give me the gun.
I'll shoot you.
no, you won'T.
you don't have it in you.
you're a doctor, a healer...
not a killer.
you're right, I am a healer, but first I need something to heal.
what happened to my people?
what happened to them?
you okay?
Yeah.
what happened?
my people, they are gone.
what are you talking about? All of them? What happened?
where did he go?
I didn't see.
who are you talking about?
not arrows!
we need to move!
come on, let's go!
how you feeling?
I am fine.
Dr. Keller insists I remain in bed.
she fears I have a concussion.
well, you should listen to her.
we just got back from new athos.
the bola kai are all gone.
must have scared them off.
Rodney's got teams going out there to collect clues about what happened to your people.
did you find Nabel?
searched the entire planet, no life signs.
he must have escaped through the gate.
or, more likely, he's lying dead somewhere.
he knows what happened to my people.
I will find them.
I know you will, and we're going to help you, but you've got to rest and get your strength back.
whoever did this will pay.
I will make certain of it.
Hey, doc, how you feeling?
Oh, it's just a sprain. I'll be fine.
why is it that you are allowed to resume working, and I am not?
because I didn't take half the beating you did.
I have suffered worse.
Yeah, well, I believe you, but you're on my turf now, so you have to listen to me.
I'll check in on you later.
so...
I got permission to go home for a few days of r&R.
God bless that intergalactic gate bridge, huh?
anyway...
I get to see my dad...
and I have you to thank for that.
how long must I stay here?
about another day or so.
I told you, I feel fine.
I do not have a concussion.
you're right.
you don'T.
Teyla, I've looked over your test results.
there's something we need to talk about.
initiating secondary diagnostics... now!
no variances.
are you sure? - Positive.
check again.
Rodney, there is nothing here.
okay, just get over here and monitor the power readings.
no variances. - Hmm.
are you catching any discrepancies on your end?
nothing. - Are you sure?
Rodney. - Okay, just go back. Go back, go back, go back.
all right, do we know what the problem is?
Yeah. The Gate's not working.
I think we figured that much last week when you broke it.
I did not break the Gate.
it just happened to stop working around the same time you were screwing around with it?
I wasn't screwing around with it.
I was running a streamlining program, designed to boost its operating efficiency.
Yeah, well, good job.
it had nothing to do with why the gate malfunctioned.
we've been able to eliminate a number of possible reasons, including my streamlining program, and I feel confident that we're making some progress and that things will be up and running in - [Explosion]
what was that?
an unidentified object just struck the city.
why didn't the sensors pick it up?
I don't know. It came in so fast.
I'm getting a low-level energy signature.
what could it be?
let's find out.
any injuries? - No, sir.
thank god, it hit the reading library, or someone really could've gotten hurt.
what is it?
it's obviously some kind of mobile, self-contained unit.
a drone, possibly a probe-- it's definitely not Wraith design.
perhaps it's Lantean.
a de-orbited satellite or a device on a recall directive.
Yeah, maybe.
it's still emanating that trace energy field.
is it dangerous?
no, it's just interesting.
check that out.
it was damaged on re-entry.
re-entry wouldn't have caused that.
looks like weapons fire. Maybe it took a hit before it came down.
and yet it came out in one piece.
tough little bastard.
Colonel, do we know what it is yet?
looks like a probe of some kind.
