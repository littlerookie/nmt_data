you gonna Ieave me again?
never.
that pIace you work, do they have homemade Iemon meringue pie there?
sure. -Not the kind with the canned-fiIIing crap?
Oh, big can, yay size. Says " homemade " on the IabeI.
I want you to take the weekend off. - It's onIy Thursday.
you gonna argue with me? -Know better than to do that, boss.
weII, good.
all fighters are pigheaded some way or other.
some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something.
can you spare a few minutes for the ImmacuIate Conception?
truth is, even if they're wrong...
...even if that one thing is gonna be the ruin of them...
...if you can beat that last bit out of them, then they ain't fighters at all.
thought I said I'd see you Monday. -You sure did, boss.
that was Iast night.
you said not to argue with you.
damn woman won't do a thing I teII her.
you want my advice?
what?
where are your shoes?
I'm airing out my feet.
you got big hoIes in your socks.
Oh, they're not that big.
didn't I give you money for some new ones?
these are my sIeeping socks.
my feet Iike a IittIe air at night.
how come you're wearing them in the daytime, then?
because my daytime socks got too many hoIes in them.
weII, if I give you some more money, you buy some new socks.
pIease?
weII, I'd be tempted, but I couIdn't say for sure.
might find its way to the track.
it's over. It's over.
didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.
I got the breathing thing down.
no, you ain't breathing because you're knocking them out in the first round.
thought that was the point. -The point is to get good.
can't get good if you keep knocking them out first round.
how am I gonna get you fights?
nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed, now.
why am I stiII doing four-rounders, boss?
because you haven't got the Iungs for six rounds.
I do if I keep knocking them out in the first round.
Frankie made her fight one more four-rounder...
...just to let her know who was boss.
three, four, five...
...six, seven...
sorry, boss.
Maggie left no doubt about it.
aII right, Iet's do it.
her first six-rounder didn't go quite as smooth.
get up!
to your corner.
three, four, five... -Get up.
...six, seven... -Get up.
...eight, nine, ten. It's over. -You can do this.
Maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round.
after that, no manager wanted to put his fighter in with Maggie.
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side.
that only worked for so long.
then Frankie did something he hated doing.
he took a chance.
box.
he moved her up in class.
that could've been a mistake.
watch the right!
watch it. Watch it.
break, break. Step back. Break. Time.
damn, damn, damn.
give us two seconds, wiII you?
okay. -Just two seconds.
your nose is broke. -Oh, damn.
fix it. -I can't, I can't.
you can fix it. -I can't. I've gotta caII it.
I've seen what you can do. Fix it.
I can snap it back into pIace, but I can't stop the bIeeding.
the ring doctor's gonna caII it.
PIease, Frankie, if you can stop the bIood, I can beat her.
bite down on this.
InhaIe. -What?
InhaIe. -What?
breathe in.
okay, huh? -Yeah, it's okay.
aII right, you got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyser...
...and it's gonna spray aII over the front row.
twenty seconds, that's aII you've got.
now get going.
go to your corner.
three, four, five...
come on, breathe. Breathe. -...six, seven, eight...
...nine, ten.
aII right! -Yeah!
right.
what you reading?
what's she saying?
wants to know what you're reading.
it's Yeats. Keep your head back.
why don't you taIk a IittIe Yeats to her.
show her what a treat that is.
when the heII they gonna get to her?
I'm okay, Frankie.
What'd you Iearn tonight? - AIways protect myseIf.
what's the ruIe? - AIways protect myseIf.
Margaret FitzgeraId? -Here.
I'II be right here.
how you doing? - Me?
Yeah, you. - I'm not the one who's hurt.
broken nose don't hurt that much.
why are you teIIing me that?
no reason.
but some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone.
and no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.
did you write your daughter? -Every week.
I've no idea why you come to church.
after her 12th straight knockout, Frankie got a couple of real good offers.
the first was to fight Billie "The Blue Bear" Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.
BiIIie " The BIue Bear. "
Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin.
had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.
didn't seem to matter to her...
...that something like that could kill a person.
and the crowds loved her.
he turned it down without even telling her.
the next was to fight the British champ...
...a Jamaican girl Billie just beat. -HeIIo?
not interested.
he turned that down too.
that's a Iot of money, boss.
Yeah, you're making money. What are you stiII working here for?
it's a titIe match, right?
are you British? It's a titIe you can't take away.
she's got nothing to Iose, you got nothing to win.
might stiII be a good fight.
Yeah, I just-- I just brought you up to weIterweight.
too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some buIIshit champ?
didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.
weII, you can get yourseIf another manager any time you want.
in fact, if you'd Iearn to protect your face a IittIe better...
...I wouIdn't have to turn down this money.
my face is out there so much it's a miracIe I haven't been knocked out yet.
no, you can't work here anymore tonight.
Mm-hmm? - do you own, like, the sand and the water?
nobody owns the water. God owns--It's God's water.
what if someone walks onto your beach, right? Let's say if you do own it.
no, man, you don't own the beach.
what you own is sand on the beach, man. - Here. Here, man.
what if there's a naked girl on the beach? -[ Chuckles ]
that girl's not yours. You don't own the girl.
what if she breaks her foot on your property? - She could sue me.
[ all Chuckling ]
sue me! Sue me! [ Chuckling ]
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! - Holy shit!
ditch it, man! Ditch it!
dude, can you eat it? - The whole bag?
fuck it!
Hey, Mike, um, while you're at it?
those are 'shrooms, dude! - Come on, man, just eat it!
[ gags ] - Mike, uh...
I hate to ask, but, uh...for the team? - I can't eat that!
No! Throw it out the window! - Okay! Okay! Okay!
all right, I'm doin' a drop.
I'm goin' for a drop. -Just opening the window.
it's gone. It's gone. - We're cool. It's cool.
[tires Screeching ] - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
we're dead! - All right, all right. Windows down! Windows down!
[ siren ] - Windows down! Put the windows down!
all right, we're cool. We're cool.
God, did you see that?
it must have been, like, a double homicide or something fuckin' cool.
we was freakin' out, man. - Man, I almost had a heart attack.
Mike, you didn't eat both those bags, did you?
come and get it. - [ Laughing ]
you must have eaten, like, a hundred bucks worth of pot...
and, like, 30 bucks worth of shrooms, man. - Who's the man?
so, I'm gonna--I'm gonna need 130 buck, you know...
whenever you get a chance.
fuck, man. - That-That's not really cool, man.
is that the same car, man?

Whoo!
we're in high-speed pursuit of a white Miata headin' southbound on 2-9-4.
unit 91, come in, 91. Unit 91, come in, 91.
what are you doing out there, 91? Quit counting your pubes.
we got a hell-raiser in a white Miata.
Ninety-one, are you there? Ninety-one?
Ninety-one, are you there?
Hey, good-lookin'. You catch any speeders today?
Whoo! - What the fuck!
[ siren Blaring ] -[ Man On Radio ] Let's go, 91.
rabbit, get that gun out!
Aw, Mac, you fucker!
greetings. [ Laughs ]
you guys are too slow. - You killed my dummy.
mac, now I'm gonna pay you. But I shouldn't, 'cause I knew it was you the whole time.
thorny, don't lie in front of the rookie. It sets a bad example.
foster, where are your shoes? - What, are you the shoe police now?
I am, and you owe me 20 laps around the bar. Let's go.
your black magic only works on the rookie. - That's brown magic.
pay up. - When do I get to do that?
you'll get your chance, Rook. Shots?
Yeah. - That's a lot of booze.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - I'm impressed.
[Yells ] -Jesus!
sorry, boys, you're on duty.
on your tab, Officer Womack? - Rookie, pay the lady.
[ man On Radio ] Unit 23. Come in, 23.
unit 23. Come in, 23.
do you need me out there? Do you need my assistance?
shut up, Farva. - I can be there.
listen, we got the Miata. We're okay.
what about those dopers you picked up? Do you need my assistance?
the snozberries taste like snozberries. - [ Chuckles ]
Oh, shit! - He killed the cops!
Oh, shit! - He killed the cops!
get out of the car, man! - This is a cop car!
hello. - You boys like Mexico?
one, two, three, do it!
Oh, go, girlfriend. I'm your mother.
come on, Thorny. You're losing to the rookie. It's embarrassing.
come on, Rabbit. You can do it.
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you. I got Thorny in front by a lot.
what's the matter, your mama didn't teach you how to chug?
come on, Thorn. Come on, Thorn.
Ohh! - Goddamn it.
[ belches ] I am all that is man.
every time. - Finish it up.
see, there you have it. You're doing it all wrong. Open your throat, relax the jaw.
don't forget to cup the balls. You're never gonna win with those thin little bird lips you got there.
this guy's got these big old powerful lips. Am I correct, Thorn?
so much of my authority is derived from the power right here.
Hey, guys.
Wow.
uh, do you have any more syrup? -Sorry, Urs.
why couldn't they chug ketchup? - [ Laughs ]
it's a good thing you didn't order hash browns.
I mean, if they had been chugging the ketchup.
[ rabbit ] You get the score of that Red Sox game last night?
I turned it off just after-- - Ah, waiter. There you are.
I will have the enchilada platter with two tacos and no guacamole.
Smy? - Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.
I don't get it. Tacos?
they think I'm Mexican.
you're not Mexican?
another highway cop? What, are you guys multiplying?
Yeah, if they can figure which hole to stick it in.
Ah, what the fuck? - [ Laughs ]
Hey, I saw that! - Sit down, Rando.
that's it! - [Yelling ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! All right, all right!
cut it out, you turkeys! - He fuckin' started it!
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys get that syrup in them...
they get a little antsy in their pantsy.
you just can't keep them under control.
you should keep these dogs on a leash, John.
let's go.
hail to thee! - Hey, all right!
Hey, what's up, bone diddlies? Did I miss the song?
[ mumbling ] - Sing it again, rookie bitch.
forgot the coffee. - My bad, Cap.
all right, all right. Let's get started.
I got the latest shit list, gentlemen.
it's down to Flagstone, Deer Lick and us.
and if we keep up these low numbers, you can bet your sweet butts...
we're gonna get the big, ugly ax.
who'll bust heads on the highway? - The goddamn local cops!
[ booing ] -And you better believe that Grady and his goons have got a copy of this list, so we need to step it up.
who wants cream?
nobody? Okay, no cream.
foster, how many tickets did you issue last week?
uh, I don't have my figures here in front of me. - Three.
I can't make 'em speed. - Try hidin'.
and grow a goddamn moustache, why don't ya? - I haven't shaved in two weeks.
I'm growin' mine. - Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?
I'll tell you when it's time to grow a moustache. - Coffee's served!
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's. That's Rabbit's.
I get it. It's Rabbit's. - Oh, look, a bar of soap.
Oh, shit! I got you good, you fucker!
awesome prank, Farva. - Better than the crap you pull, Frank.
look, fellas... - Bite it, Rook. Make him look like a dick.
every Thursday night I walk into the Lodge to play Hearts...
and they always have my Old-Fashioned just waiting there.
I like that. - Bite it. Bite
Oh, hell! Give me the goddamn soap!
we got 50 miles of highway. That stretch of highway is ours.
I'll be damned if I'll let Grady and those buttheads get their hands on it!
thorny, you're the ranking officer here.
let's do your jobs and keep this place open, huh? Let's do it. Farva!
your suspension continues. Hit the radio.
Oh, yes.
Oh. Oh, local Smokeys on our turf.
all right, hit it. - [ Siren Blares ]
see, that's what O'Hagan was talking about.
Hi. You guys forget what color your car is?
Bye-bye. -[ Foster ] Later, dude.
Bye-bye. -[ Foster ] Later, dude.
all right, how about "Cat Game"?
cat Game? What's, uh, what's the record? - Thorny did six...
but I think you can do ten. - Ten?

uh, sorry about that. - All right, meow...

your registration? Hurry up meow. - Oh.
[ Chuckles ] - Sorry.
[ Chuckles ] - There somethin' funny here, boy?
no, no, no.
well, then, why you laughing, Mr. Larry Johnson?
all right meow, where were we? - Are you saying "meow"?
am I saying "meow"?
I-I-I thought-- - Don't think, boy.
meow, do you know how fast you were going? - [ Laughs ]
meow, what is so damn funny?
I could have sworn you said "meow.
do I look like a cat to you, boy? - [ Laughs ]
am I jumping around all nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree?
no. No. - Am I drinkin' milk from a saucer?
no. - Do you see me eatin' mice?
[ both Laughing ] - Now you stop laughin' right meow.
Yes, sir.
meow, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket on this one.
but-- - No "buts" meow. That's the law.
it's not so funny meow, is it?
meow!
Ooo-wee-ooh!
thanks for washing my car, Rook.
you know what this is? - A chamois cloth?
ha! Lucky guess. I just lost a buck to myself.
think that's funny, do you? - Yeah, I do.
also heard something funny about how you got suspended.
something about a school bus full of kids?
Oh, you heard that, did ya? Let me tell you another funny story, New Jack.
back in '7 4...
the great Charlie Rich was named Country Musician of the Year.
then in '75, he had to hand the award off to the new one.
and you know who that was?
Mr. "Sunshine on My Goddamn Shoulders," John Denver.
Really? - Yeah. Can you believe it?
Wow! - Replaced by John Fuckin' Denver.
amazing. - Yeah.
well, I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich didn't pull out his cigarette lighter and light that award on fire in front of everyone.
do you get it?
so you're saying you'll set my Country Music Award on fire?
I'm saying when my suspension's up, you better watch your ass.
or you'll light my ass on fire?
you wanna go? You wanna take one? Make your first move.
Hey! I hate to break up the honky convention, but we got a 10-92.
you wanna take this one, Rod? - Hell, yeah!
I bet you do--Ohh!
nice wax job, Rook.
thank you, sir. [ Laughs ] - You
what the hell is this? We got local pigs runnin' around?
how'd the locals beat us here? We're, like, ten miles out.
look at this chump. Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.
take a walk, buddy, take a walk.
holy shit! It's a cool Winnebago.
my Uncle Denny used to have one just like this. - Rabbit, put your game face on.
you got it, boss.
Hey, what the fuck? - Oh-oh!
[ sniffs ] - Oh, yes.
Oh, man! What happened here? - Take a walk, sonny.
this investigation is already under control. - Well, now it is.
Hey! - Don't touch the crime scene, rodent!
rabbit. Hey, look at that. Johnny Chimpo.
quit slappin' me. - Would you stop touching my rookie, Grady?
Hey, I'll touch you. -[ Banging ]
this is the Spurbury Police. Put your hands up and come outta there!
[ squealing ] - Get the fuck out of here!
glamor pet. No dice. Get your tape. - Okay. Let's cruise.
sounds like y'all have a hog problem. - Oh, watch it, Mac.
mac, I'm serious. Be careful, Mac. He's angry.
he's angry? Well, hello. - Hey, mark it off.
Smy, you mark it off. - Back it up, Grady. I'm serious.
what's the point? Didn't you guys get shut down already?
Oh, yeah, that's next week. - [ Chuckles ]
your bust. You know there's a dead chick in there?
move it, Ramashit!
take it up with O'Hagan! - Fight, fight, fight!
I'll give you the fat guy for Foster and, uh how about that stupid guy for Rabbit?
they're both kinda fat and stupid. - [ Chuckles ]
get these damn handcuffs off now, Ramathorn!
[ thorny ] Cut him loose. - [ Ursula ] Go ahead, Smy.
you want to tell me what bug crawled up your big ass, Grady?
Yeah, I will tell you. This is our crime scene. We are takin' it.
it's highway. It's our jurisdiction. - No. No.
this highway is closed. This is our jurisdiction. -[ Banging ]
Aw, fuck it. You deal with the hog.
Hey, Chief.
what in hell's gotten into you guys?
I told you to be good. I told you this was a bad time.
but you go ahead and get into a battle royale with the locals at a crime scene.
but they started that fight. - Of course they started the fight.
now they've taken a jurisdictional grievance against us.
they want us to blow it.
[ sighs ] I mean, a murder on the highway...
and you give them the investigation.
Christ! We look like a bunch of pussies.
all right, come on out, Rabbit.
I guess I just go take a shower then, huh?
Ow!
strike three! You're out of there!
all right, good cut, Ruthie. Good cut. Come on.
[ man ] Next batter! Batter up! Next batter! Let's go.
but, Thorn, if they do shut you down...
maybe you could stick around here?
I don't know, get a different job?
you can always come work in my shop.
Yeah, retired cop goes to work for his hippie girlfriend in her head shop. Too sitcom.
okay. You better pay attention, Coach. Our son's up.
all right, Arlo. Watch the ball. Get a hit.
you got it.
let's do it. - All right, Arlo.
Whoa! -[ Booing, Jeering ]
Hey, you gotta keep on your toes. - Do somethin' about that, ref.
[ mac ] Sorry-ass local cops.
you think you have a nice relationship with someone based on professional courtesy and mutual boredom.
the next thing you know, they're trying to take you out.
what? What?
I don't wanna get transferred.
have to go be a rookie again with a bunch of random dudes. - Don't worry about it.
if it happens, we'll, uh, we'll all just stay here, open up a roller disco.
uh, anybody want a corn dog?
see if they got any chocolate bananas. Foster?
[ man ] Ohh!
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
Hey, congratulations. You're the one millionth person to say that to me.
Oh. What do I win? - Ooh. Um...
Ahh. There you go.
hope I don't get brain freeze.
I'm not sure you've got the required equipment.
so, listen, I, um, had a really good time at that Winnebago fight.
maybe, uh, I don't know, we could do it again sometime.
all right, all right. Fair is fair.
you can slug me back if you want to.
Really? Okay. - Yeah.
hold my snow cone.
okay. -[ Man ] Heads up!
[ screams ] - Hey, what happened over there?
[Yells ] What? Wh--Why?
how about a little pep, hmm?
from those guys over there.
[ Chuckles ] Assholes.
you want to move that, buddy. Now!
so, about my field time. - Yeah, yeah. I've been thinkin' a lot about that.
I think I might be able to talk to Grady for you.
pink stick, eat it or lose it. - Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.
I mean, because I'm ready to go out on patrol.
I'm goin' nuts being on the radio all the time. I'd like to get some field work.
yeah? Why don't you take your radio and go stand in a field.
move that gigantic cotton candy!
goddamn it! How's the view from sugar heaven, bitch?
Hi. I'm looking for Chief Grady. I have some files for him.
Grady's not here. I'll take the file.
it's kind of important. How about Officer Rando? - Nope.
what do you need? I'm the only one here?
there are no male officers around?
just give me the file.
what's this?
so you originally from Vermont or, uh, or what?
you know, you've got a lot of courage, walkin' into the lion's den.
Oh, I got brass buns. - Mm. You should join the band.
what are your cells, eight by eight?
ours are nine by nine. No big deal.
listen, you seem like a really nice guy, but I just don't date cops.
I'm not much of a cop, really. More like a civilian trapped in a cop's body.
Oh. Well, I hear you can get an operation for that.
but then, I guess you'd miss out on all those wacky things you highway guys do.
Yeah, those stories about us are mostly lies, really.
except for the one about how we pulled over AC/DC's bus...
and then they flew us down to Jamaica to party with them; that one's true.
[ Chuckles ] - But, yeah, other than that, it's pretty boring out there.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know.
all right, it's probably time for you to get out of here.
I don't want to get fired too. - Oh, I'm not getting fired.
I'm gettin' shut down. That's a big difference.
in our cells, the door is over here. - Right.
[ mac ] A couple of hyenas.
well, you know, they are speeding.
come in, Radio. - Don't call me Radio, Unit 91 .
then don't call me Unit 91, Radio.
are you done? - Yeah, okay, Radio.
we got a suspicious vehicle. White Caprice, Vermont plates.
Roger. Checking. - Thank you, Radio.
unit 91, that license plate belongs to a local Spurbury police vehicle.
it does? Oh, my God!
very funny, 91 . - Thank you, Radio.
Whoa! Looks like that truck's planning on skipping the weigh-in.
Yeah, well, you don't weigh in, you don't wrestle.
[ foster ] Whoa! What's this jack-off doin; trying to pull him over?
there's no fuckin' way that is happenin'.
[ foster ] What the hell's he doin'? - I got somethin'.
[ mac ] Yeah. That's right, doofus. Move it along.
you, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?
do you wanna do "Repeat"?
[ Chuckles ] No. I've been thinking a lot about what the captain said.
I'd like to play it straight this time, okay? - Okay.
for O'Hagan. - For O'Hagan.
good morning.
would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
sure. I was just-- - Good morning.
would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
Yeah. No problem. - Excuse me one second. [ Chuckles ] No.
excuse me one second. [ Chuckles ] No.
did, uh, I do something wrong, officers...
because I know I wasn't speeding.
why didn't you weigh in? - Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?
did I miss that weigh station?
they got me runnin' so many miles...
I just must have dazed out and well
I'll pull into the next one and get weighed, okay?
[ both ] What are you pulling back there?
well, uh, mostly just soap, I think.
[ both ] Why don't we take a look?
listen, Officers, I'm on a really tight schedule. I really need to
let's go, Mr. Galikanokus.
well, you heard him. Let's go, Mr...
hop on up.
Okay-silly-dilly-dokey-o. I'm an idiot.
Yeah, that's true.
sorry about the light there.
I have a flashlight in the cab.
Hey! Mr. Galikanokus! - Whoa!
[ pounding On Door ] - Mr. Galikanokus!
we should have seen that comin'. - We should have seen that comin'.
it is time to stop now, Mac. - It is time to stop now, Mac?
[ mac ] And that was the second time I got crabs.
awesome. - Afternoon.
Hey. - Hey.
it stinks like sex in here. - [ Chuckles ]
what happened?
we got a little distracted by somebody doin' the "Repeater.
huh. That'll happen. - [ All ] That will happen.
well, you did it this time.
fishin' your car out of Lake Leblanc right now. - Oh, man.
Nah, we just parked it across the street.
all right, listen. Next time this kind of thing happens...
I want you to stop, take a deep breath...
and pull your heads out of each other's asses, would ya? - Language.
it's easy for you to say. He's got a tiny little head.
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?
soap, I think.
reefer.
[ radio, Indistinct ]
[ mac ] Whoo-hoo! That's one stinky pyramid.
we should've built a stinky igloo and climb in.
that's a lot of pot. - Thinkin' back to your tour days with the Dead, Rabbit?
better lock this shit up, huh, buddy? - What are you talkin' about?
enhance.
enhance. Enhance.
just print the damn thing!
all right, what do we know about this Galikanokus guy?
it's a fake name, fake license.
Bunty Soap? - Fake soap company.
what, plastic fake? Decorative fake? What? - No, like they don't exist.
so, we got 150 kilos of marijuana and no arrests. We got nothin'.
[ rabbit ] I got a theory, Cap.
these, uh, bales of pot, they have that red Johnny Chimpo sticker on them.
and that dead woman in the Winnebago had the same logo tattooed on her back.
see, a lot of drug dealers use stickers to mark their products. Like a brand name.
see! Where'd you learn that, Cheech? Drug school?
shut up, Farva.
did that bag you pulled off those college kids have that sticker?
um...
I don't believe it did.
was there any marijuana on that Winnebago? - Nope.
a monkey tattoo. Sounds kinda flimsy.
what's the significance of this John Chimpo fella?
[ chuckling ] - Uh, well, you know those really cheap Japanese cartoons?
no? This is basically a cheaper Afghani knockoff.
it's this monkey that basically travels around the world...
uh, doing nasty things.
his butler tries to keep him in line, but, uh-- [ Chuckles ] No.
it's really funny, Cap. It's Afghanistanimation.
the monkey has a butler? Great.
is that what they do in Arabia, Thorny? - How the hell should I know?
[ chuckling ] -All right. Somebody get me a VTR copy of this thing.
I'll talk to Grady, see if he'll let us take a look at the Winnebago.
all right. You ready for the photo shoot? Okay, fellas, let's take it.
pull down your pants. - Shut up, Farva, you idiot. Come on, do it.
John. I'm not interrupting, am I? - Mad Timber!
no. Come in, come in. - Good work, gentlemen, all the way around.
could I get in on that? - Sure. Why not?
excuse me. Good work. Good work, Officer. - Hey.
you're gonna have a hard time shutting us down now, right, Mr. Mayor?
we got a murder one day, a drug bust the next.
I'm thinkin' we need as much police as we can get.
that'd be a good slogan, wouldn't it? - Mm-hmm.
tell that to the budget committee.
I just got off the phone with Governor Jessman...
and she's gonna be swinging through here on her way to Burlington.
[ chattering ] - Give me a gun, huh, to hold for the pictures.
rabbit, run. Gun. -And, John...
as far as this brawling with the local police is concerned
it won't happen again, Bill. I'm onto it.
good.
cause when the governor shows up, I'm gonna throw her a little party.
[ chattering, Laughing ]
we're gonna let her know just how this community feels about its law enforcement.
spread it on!
[ Arlo ] Come on, Dad! Faster! Faster!
so what's the deal with you and Bobbi? - Come on, Dad!
you guys are goin' out, but you, um, sleep with other people?
well, I mean, yeah. Not really. Kind of.
it's sort of a long story, all right?
Well--Hey, Arlo, does Mom ever have any friends over?
any older boys? - Can't we turn the siren on?
in a minute, all right? Are you listening?
does she have anyone over that maybe you call uncle? - Like Uncle Fred?
uncle Fred? Who's Uncle Fred?
[ laughs ] He's this crazy bird on TV.
he's crazy. He flies around like a pigeon. - Oh, right.
uncle Freddy, he's great. He's a crazy bird.
okay.
we got one.
you wanna take this one, kid?
what about you? - I gotta stay with little "A.
you're okay, right? - Sure.
go on. Make mama proud. - All right.
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche, brown, Washington plates
Eight-Donna-Peanut-Eunuch. - Roger. Checking.
[ techno ] -[ Engine Revs ]
kill it. - [Turns Off Engine, Music Stops ]
can I please see your license and registra--[Whistles ]
[ german Accent ] I'm sorry, Officer, for the speeding violation.
I am so used to driving on the Autobahn.
Uh--What?
[ speaking German ] ...Sean Cassidy.
[ speaking German ] Yummy, yummy.
[ both Speaking German ]
[ clears Throat ] - Nicht?
do you know why I pulled you over? - We were driving way too fast.
ja. -Ja.
officer, this is a major problem...
because I cannot afford another ticket with mein Porsche.
is there maybe something I can do for you, hmm? Or maybe my wife...
could do for you to avoid this dilemma?
is there maybe something you would like me to do to you?
or maybe something you would like to do to me? Hmm?
uh, 'cause you were doing 90 in a 65.
could you hold on a minute? Just a minute. I'll be right back.
[ man Speaking German ] - [ Techno ]
[ speaking German ]
twenty-three, that Porsche is hot. - Are you sure?
please, Thorn, not now. No. - He can join too, if you like?
get over here. - Tickle, tickle.
ja. - Hold on a second. Just one second, huh?
what? - Farva said that car is stolen.
what? Stolen?
shit! - Is there a problem, officers?
hold on! Come on, Thorn, I need this.
look, kid, any other day, I'd step in here and show you how to swing.
but the car's stolen.
goddamn it!
you got to get over there and you got to cuff her.
[ stammering ] - Do it! You're a highway patrolman.
cut it out! Do it.
now turn that off and step out of the car, sir. - [ Stops ]
this is no problem, hmm? - Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.
Ah, now some fun for both of us. - [ Both ] Get back in the car!
[ thorn ] Rabbit, get over there and cuff her.
[ thorn ] Up against the car. - Ma'am, I hate to do this to you, but would you
would you please put your hands behind your back? - Now things are getting kinky.
[ siren ] -[ Thorn ] Arlo!
[ man ] I love your-- -[ Arlo ] I'm on the radio. Come in, Farva.
[ man, Indistinct ] -[ Thorny ] Arlo! Rabbit! Let's go!
climb up on Uncle Rabbit's lap, Arlo, okay?
I don't think that's such a good idea, Thorn. - Uh, right.
okay, why don't you just sit in the middle, buddy?
Ursula, what the fuck? There's no T. P. in the bathroom.
what about the piece stuck to your shoe? - What about that piece?
shit!
you know, you might get ahead around here if you made the extra effort.
do you want me to wipe your ass? - That's not what I
well, around my house, my wife knows to refill the T. P.
I'm not your wife, Smy. - No. And if you were, I'd take you down a peg or two.
Ooh.
Hi, douche bag.
[ door Closes ] - You know, if you were my wife...
I'd massage your feet every night until you fell asleep.
[ Chuckles ] Nice try.
he strangles her and puts her face in pig food?
what an asshole. Got any I. D. on the corpse?
Yeah. "Jane Doe." Do you know her?
[ laughs ] Oh, we're working on it.
it's called routine police work.
apparently, she had a cartoon monkey tattooed on her back.
John Chimpo, I'm told.
and those cannabis bags in our truck...
those stickers had the same monkey logo.
so we think there might be some kind of connection.
are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey is bringing drugs into our town?
look, I know we don't like each other. - I like you.
come on! I'm looking for a little cooperation here.
John Chimpo. [ Clears throat ]
[ feedback ] - Hanson, could you round up, uh, Johnny Chimpo...
and, uh, Jerry Giraffe and Arty the Alligator and bring them in for a lineup.
Thanks, sweetie. - Sounds like they're having fun.
that's what happens when you start hanging out with a state trooper.
we show you the funny.
well, where were we?
uh, you were laying your best rap on me and I was resisting.
but you were starting to think about it. - [ Chuckles ]
I told you. I don't touch highway hog. - Baby, I'm Sizzle Lean.
I scratched your back, Bruce. I scratched it good and hard.
now, either you scratch my back or you're gonna get my size ten boot up your ass!
desperation is a stinky cologne, John.
let's see. You are an expendable line item on a state spending bill.
you have a station full of crappy cops.
I am about this far away from having a bigger budget.
and now, you come in here talking about...
monkey tattoos on some drunk lady's tit like it's a goddamn drug conspiracy.
[ Chuckles ]
keep your bags packed, John. Let us handle the real police work, huh?
uh, John, when you do get shut down, you come back, talk to me.
I can always use a good meter maid.
[ engine Starts ]
[ engine Revving ]
let it roll.
[ alternative Rock ]
[ country ]
[ alternative Rock ] - Come and get me, Mac.
[ country ] -[ Man Moaning ]
see you later, sucker! - Ohh! Ohh! Fuck!
can't catch the Rabbit. [ Laughing ]
damn it! - Out of the car! Out of the car, scumbag!
well, hello, Shirley.
[ siren Approaching ] - Come on, Farva, man. Same team. Same team.
what's Thorny going to say, Rook?
[ springs Squeaking ] -[ Thorny ] Honestly, Bobbi. I think it's gonna happen.
[ bobbi ] We don't want to leave. We really like this town.
I'll probably just get sent down to Brattleboro. It's a nice town.
I don't think it's a healthy time for him to move.
[ bed Springs Creaking ] - He's got a lot of real good friends here.
who? That creepy kid with the lisp?
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.
look, I don't want to go without you.
then you should stay here. - But I can't if they transfer me.
Hey, stop jumping on the bed.
Hey, honey, it's almost Mitternacht, huh?
Uhh. We really should be getting back to the jail.
you don't want us turning into pumpkins. - [ Speaking German ]
thorn, can't they just stay a little longer?
all right. Who wants a mustache ride?
I want one. I want one! - I do! I do! I do!
[ phone Rings ]
Spurbury Police. - Oh, thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. It's terrible.
Oh, there's a disgusting pervert flashing people.
ma'am, I need you to calm down.
I can't calm down! You calm down! Oh, my God!
ma'am, tell me your location. - He's right in front of the building...
on 323, uh, Karuna Street.
that's this address, ma'am. - Oh, well, then, maybe you can see him.
he's right in front of the building. Go look. I'll hold.
[ chuckling ] Did you see him? Oh, he's disgusting.
he certainly is, ma'am. - Oh, I think he's going to the window again.
Oh, the humanity! He's so bulgy. He's like a moose.
Oh, no! I think he's going back again.
[ gun Cocks ] -[ Deep Voice ] Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, God! Please don't shoot me. I-I'm naked.
drop your coat and grab your toes.
what? - I'm gonna show you where the wild goose goes.
Oh, this isn't happening. I-I-I'm a police officer. Ursula, help!
baby, I'm gonna butter your bread.
you don't have these at your station?
[ deep Voice ] I don't suppose you got a pair of fresh underwear I could borrow?
I'm not sure you could fit into my panties.
you know, you can't tell anybody about this.
I already told my mom about you. - [ Giggles ]
Ohh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - [Wood Creaking ]
shit! - Baby, you rocked me.
Wow! What is this?
rabbit, you're off the road! Shut up, Farva! - It's a good move, Cap.
rabbit, you're on radio. Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.
wait a minute-- - What do you want me to do about it?
my hands are tied! It's all over the police band!
rabbit, you couldn't have picked a worst time!
I got a Q-17 request form today.
we have to inventory our equipment.
which means our balls are this close to the band saw.
what are you sellin', Mac, hot dogs?
there's a new billboard. - Casino le Fantastique?
[ humming Fanfare ] - Let me guess.
you just humped the mayor's wife and burnt down City Hall.
I'll do you one better, Captain.
so I'm walkin' down by the local police station, minding my own business.
but there's something funny in the air.
I feel like I just gotta get into that Winnebago.
so after I jimmy the door, I do a quick recon. - Bullshit.
I can see there's something not right about that bed.
so I busted it in. - Bullshit.
and just sittin' there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers.
let me get this straight. You went into the impound, scaled the fence...
broke into the Winnebago and smashed the bed, all on a hunch?
I'll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet.
what? Do you think I just grew this weed?
how could you know to look underneath the bed?
it must have been my sixth-- or even my seventh sense.
you know, Rabbit, a good cop doesn't really know why he does anything.
disregard that, Rabbit. - And you didn't even think to call in your partner?
so these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don't know it?
not a clue. It's totally hidden.
and Grady's walkin' around like he's hot soup. All right, we got a chance here.
but we got to beat these guys to the punch.
mac, you and Foster check out the truck stops...
and find out what you can about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.
I'll talk to Grady and play a little hardball. Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.
you got to promise me no more bullshit.
cap, you know I'm cool, but I can take no responsibility for these white devils.
well, you're gonna have to.
now, Rodney, we're under a lot of pressure here.
remember what we talked about. If anything happens...
count to ten, take some deep breaths.
ten deep breaths. I got it, Cap.
trust me, skipper, we'll make you proud.
[ foster ] You are awesome. -[ Chuckling ]
you are incredible. You are a fantastic cop. - Keep goin'.
uh, and then somebody said, I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...
foster, you deserve a promotion. - Hmm. I think you get a star.
Mm. Foster? Wait. I don't know if this is gonna work.
this steering wheel is jabbing my ass. - Oh, right.
Ow! Okay.
in New York City, a guy could pay ten bucks to watch two cops have sex in a cage.
yeah? [ Moans ]
Oh.
Foster? - Yeah?
in our cruisers, somebody has to let you out of the back seat.
Oh, fuck it!
do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you?
is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect?
look, all I'm sayin', man, is switch partners. It'll be fun.
I don't think so. - Come on, mix it up a bit.
mm, no fuckin' way. - [ Chuckles ]
come on, Mac, you know you're always sayin' how funny Foster smells.
Oh, look out for Thorny, master of psychology. - Do I really smell?
all right, assholes, quit talkin' about me.
lock and load, Ramathorn. Let's kick some tail.
we weren't talkin' about you, you big idiot. - Bullshit.
truck stop, huh? - We gotta do it.
but the captain didn't say anything about going undercover.
do you think they're gonna tell us anything if they know we're cops?
get a job, man! Look, you're fuckin' super cop. You should know this.
I am super. - Plus, we can't take our car...
until they replace the door you, for no reason whatsoever, removed last night.
I told you it was those kids with the wrenches.
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks who took your car door off...
while you were sittin' in the damn thing.
I told you I was in a very deep sleep.
Yeah. You wanna tell that to O'Hagan? Maybe we can borrow his car today.
[ sighs ] - [ Sighs ]
do you even know how to drive this thing?
[ engine Starts ]
[ grinding Gears ]
[ engine Stops ]
shit! This rig sucks!
Aha!
[ engine Starts ]
[ engine Stops ]
uh, who knew it was a stick?
how about we, uh, pop a couple of Viagra...
and issue tickets with raging, mega-huge boners?
only you, Farva, can make a dark man blush.
and, no, we're not doin' it. - Ah, hell.
Hey, I came up with a great name for our car. - Oh, yeah?
get this. You're Arcot Ramathorn--Ram
and I'm Rod Farva--Rod; car Ramrod.
[ Chuckles ] Car Ramrod. You get it?
Yeah, I got it. -[ Beep ]
rabbit, I got a Plymouth Voyager... - Say "Car Ramrod." - Vermont plates--Hold on.
Vermont plates--Alpha...
check it. [ Rabbit ] Roger, 23.
you didn't say it. I wrote it on the paper. - Oh, I forgot.
Oh, yeah. - Come on, Ramathorn, what game are we playin'?
what? No games. - Don't bullshit me.
let's play one of those games I keep hearin' about. You know, Mac and Foster...
did that thing, you know, with the "who can say pussy the most.
you know, actually, Mac bet Foster he couldn't say "meow" ten times to the driver..
I realize that doesn't sound funny as I described-- - Who can say "meow" the most?
[ Chuckles ] You guys are real crazy.
Hey, look out for these guys!
hell, I can say "meow." I can say "moo.
for 20 bucks, I'll call the guy a chicken-fucker.
easy, Rod. Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
license and registration... chicken-fucker! Brawwk!
I'm glad you called. Listen. I have Bobby the Baboon in lockup...
and he says that for twenty bananas he'll provide evidence...
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp in charge of the Cartoon Network whorehouse.
look, I'm done dickin' around. We got new evidence on your murder.
who? Galikanokus? You know where he is?
no, we don't know where he is, but-- - [ Scoffs ]
then I don't see how you can possibly help us, then.
okay. This is my last offer.
either you let us in on this investigation...
or I'm gonna embarrass you personally.
[ chuckling ] Oh, how embarrassed?
like, naked in a dream embarrassed?
no, no. Embarrassed like back in '77, when you got caught fuckin' your cousin embarrassed.
she's not my cousin. [ Clears Throat ]
welcome to Dimpus. Can I take your order?
give me a, uh, double bacon cheeseburger.
double baco cheeseburger. It's for a cop.
[ man On P. A.] Roger. - What the hell's that all about?
he gonna spit in it now? - No, I was just tellin' him that so he makes it good.
don't spit in that cop's burger.
Yeah. Thanks. - Roger. Hold the spit.
give me a, uh, pie. Apple.
do you want me to hold the spit?
[ laughing ] Just kidding, Officer...Farva.
so, do you want to "Dimpisize" your meal for a quarter more?
want me to "punchisize" your face for free?
some male figure? I'm his dad. And stop with the whole transfer thing.
[ shouting, Indistinct ] - Oh, Christ.
you know what? I gotta go. Let's talk about this later, okay?
okay. Bye. - [ Beeping ]
now don't give me any lip. - It's just a quarter, and look how much more you get.
I said no! - It's just 25 cents.
Hey, listen, guy. He doesn't want it. - I can handle this, Ramathorn.
I don't want it! - Right. Uh, beverage?
gimme a, uh, liter of cola.
a what? - A liter of cola!
Leederacola." Do we make leederacola?
will you just order a large, Farva?
I don't want a large Farva. I want a goddamn liter of cola!
I don't know what that is! - Liter is French...
for"give me some fuckin' cola before I break both fuckin' lips.
all right, all right. Relax!
that look like spit to you? - Yeah.
that look like spit to you? - Yeah.
Ah, fuck it.
Mm. I feel like a real cop again.
well, I wouldn't get used to it, 'cause you know it's not gonna last.
bullshit. I'm not goin' anywhere. - All right, buddy.
we're about to get shut down anyway.
Oh, yeah? That's a lot of"Dimp.
what do you do if you get transferred? - I don't know.
bobbi doesn't want to leave, and...
I don't want to leave her and Arlo, so
Yeah, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do.
who gives a shit? I'm about to win ten million bucks anyway, right?
are ya? What are you going to do with that ten million bucks?
and you can't say, "Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers.
I'd buy a ten-million-dollar car. - Ah, good investment.
but I'd pull you over. - Bullshit. You could never catch me.
Oh, I could never catch you? - If you did, I'd activate my car's wings, and fly away.
[ cackling ] I got a good feelin' about this.
damn it, you burger punk!
you son of a bitch!
Aah! - [ Voices Shouting ]
[ screaming Continues ]
Yeah, Burger Boy!
[ Grady ] All right, all right, all right.
cut it out, you guys. Knock it off.
clear out of here. All of you.
[ kissing Sound ]
[ sighs ] I'm sorry about the delousing, Rod.
standard procedure.
it's powdered sugar. - The lice hate the sugar.
listen, Rod-- - It's delicious.
uh, good. Good. [ Inhales Deeply ]
say, Rod, what are your plans after the shutdown?
we're not gettin' shut down, Grady. We're drug busters.
maybe they're drug busters, but you're dispatch.
Nuh-uh. I'm back on the road, now. - Until this little incident.
listen, Rod.
this whole murder thing, we've been tryin' real hard to break it open...
but O'Hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence.
now I've spoken to the governor myself.
she is gonna shut your station down, son. It's gonna happen.
now, I'm gonna have a bigger budget then, and I could really use...
a good local officer like yourself.
could I go now? - You could have your own car.
work on exciting cases. Hey, we could even chase drug dealers together.
now, the thing is, Rod...
I really need to know about your side of the investigation.
O'Hagan's making all kinds of threats, and--[ Scoffs ]
can we make a deal?
I'm all highway.
[ sighs Deeply ]
let him loose.
sorry about that, bro.
[ chuckling ]
[ door Opening ]
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
[ sighs ] What's up? - Guys.
Hey.
well, we got about, uh, twenty desk lamps.
Farva went schizoid. - That's good.
how did the undercover thing go? - Well, not so good.
turns out, this guy can't drive a semi. - Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
you guys watch that Johnny Chimpo thing?
funny, but nothin' there. - Mm. Maybe you missed something.
mm, trust me, bro. There's nothing there.
maybe we should take another look.
[ cartoon Characters Chattering, Indistinct ] -[ Officers Laughing ]
that's it, you're off the road. Never again. - Sir, no.
it was not my fault. - Neither was the goddamn school bus.
you know, there was a time we'd take a guy like you out back and beat you.
now you got your goddamn unions. - I'm not a pro-union guy.
and you're banned from Dimpus Burger. - Damn it!
get some rubber gloves. From now on, you're my cleaning lady.
beat it!
well, the butler is basically saying to Johannes Chimpo...
don't let the Great Satan tempt you with the Western culture.
you must remain true to the Taliban warlord.
cool beans. - [ Laughing ]
so, um, Galikanokus is not the butler?
well, possibly. But this is, uh, quite brilliant, really.
and so, Captain, you think there might be some connection with the smugglers?
rabbit, get this meatball out of here.
[ rabbit ] You got it, Captain. Come on, meatball.
we should probably do that.
back in the cage with your beautiful wife, huh?
what did you find out at the weigh station? - My cruiser weighs 16, 000 kg.
I just got off the phone with Tom McCardle from the budget committee.
this thing with Farva screwed our pooch. -[ Thorny ] What?
they can't lump us in with that fuckin' Martian.
we're all in the same boat. - But our shenanigans are cheeky and fun.
Yeah. His shenanigans are cruel and tragic.
which makes them not shenanigans at all, really. - Evil shenanigans.
I swear to God I'll pistol-whip the next guy that says, "shenanigans.
[ clears Throat ] Hey, Farva!
what's the name of that restaurant you like, with all the goofy shit on the walls...
and the mozzarella sticks? - You mean Shenanigans?
No! Oh! - You're talking about Shenanigans, right?
put those away!
Hey, Rabbit. - Yeah, I know. "You got beautiful, big brown lips.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
have your fun, boys. Have your fun.
cause I'm gonna start looking for for a new job.
[ snorts ]
Hey! Urs! Ha!
Hi. - Hi. Sorry I'm late.
the mayor came down today. - [ Sighs ]
[ Chuckles ] Ah, biker! I'm an idiot.
[ sighs ] Boy, you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot.
heard you got to see Farva naked. - Yeah, it was hard to miss.
so, Grady thinks he's got you guys by the balls.
Yeah. How do you feel about long-distance relationships?
well, I've been thinking about this.
I think I might have an idea.
the governor comes to town on Saturday for that big thing, right?
she's gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement...
and all of that because of your bust. - She's gonna shut us down.
No! Not if you give her more.
get the reefer out of the Winnebago and give it to her during the party.
make a big show of it. - With all that media there, she would love us for it.
no way she'll shut you down. - That reefer's locked in the Winnebago...
all right. Here's what I'll need.
five ski masks, a case of smoke bombs--the good ones
and banana peels, lots of banana-- - Foster?
how about if I just help you get in? - You would do that for me?
Yeah. What the hell. We'll work together.
like Cagney and Lacey. - [ Chuckles ]
Yeah. Well, Cagney and Lacey were women.
but-- - I could be Lacey.
Mac-o!
so that's it, huh? - C. C.S. Rockman Bulletproofing is the tops!
same guys who make our flak jackets.
now, Rabbit, a good cop does what...
before using his equipment in the field?
uh, they test it? - They test it. Exactly.
how are you shootin' today, Thorn?
dead on all morning. - [ Mac ] How about that little fella?
Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't worry about that little guy.
[ clanging ] - Good enough for me. You're my man, now.
I don't get it. How are we going to get into the local impound?
there are gonna be cops there.
[ gunshot, Clanking ] - Wa-hoo!
most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet.
they'll leave, like, one or two of the dumbest guys at the station.
how are you feelin' there, Mac? -[ Squeaky Voice ] Good enough to fuck your mother!
so, what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there.
Hey, Mac! You still have that Halloween costume?
Oh, hell, yeah. You don't throw out
Wa-hoo-hoo!
[ laughing ] Damn, that's good!
so, if we can get ten minutes, you and I can get into the impound...
get the reefer, and get it to the governor before she leaves?
nice and easy. - I like it.
you're up. - Me?
now, don't get puke on it. - Does it hurt?
you're gonna feel a little pinch.
[ thorny ] Lookin' good, Rabbit! Now don't move!
hang on, buddy. - Hey, Cap!
Hey, Captain. - Bulletproof cup, huh?
[ Chuckles ] I invented this gag, Rabbit.
only in my day, the rookie got naked. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[ gunshot, Glass Shattering ]
Thanks, Chief. - All right, Thorny. Why'd you call me up here?
[ O'Hagan ] Good to know you're still battin' for us with the budget committee, Mayor.
well, I don't want to mince words, John, but it doesn't look too good.
maybe not to the untrained eye.
but if I was a bettin' man, I'd put money on us changin' the governor's mind tonight.
well, you might want to strap on your ass-kissing boots and start right now.
I think she's your only hope. - Hello.
what is this thing again? Humane Society?
uh, it's a drug bust. - Cocaine?
hello. - Uh, marijuana.
then why are we here? - Oh, I think we're pretty well covered, Mr. Mayor.
[ timber ] I think she's got a lot of decisions to make.
I don't envy her. - Oh, I do.
I'll be lucky to have a figure like that when I'm her age.
[ mayor, Mac Laughing ] - Yeah. That's a good one.
[ phones Ringing ]
we're sending someone down, don't worry. Okay. - Thanks. You bet.
no, no, no, no. We'll bring the guns. - We're on it. We're on it.
we got it. All right, that's like twenty calls.
I'll tell you what. I'll go down there and check it out.
what about me? - Burton, somebody's got to stay here.
all right, fuck it.
shit!
maybe this is the key.
I mean, no offense, bro, but... - [ Growling ]
when did you become a cop?
none taken, Ramathorn. None taken.
really. How'd you know the key was there? - A gentleman never asks.
a lady never tells. Wonder how Rabbit's doin'?
[ growling ] -[ Rabbit ] Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! - What does that look like to you?
is the bear-- -[ Growling, Shouting Continue ]
is the guy-- - Oh, yeah. Yeah!
is the guy-- - Oh, yeah. Yeah!
seems more of a game warden thing to me.
well, it's illegal, Burton. I know that! - Whoo! Oh!
[ both Laughing ]
Oh, shit. Look who's here.
[ O'Hagan ] I thought you said he wasn't gonna make it. -[ Mac ] I tried.
glad to see you, Rodney. - Hey, how are you doin', Rowdy?
how you think I'm doin'? Open bar, ain't it? - Mm-hmm.
thought you said Bowl-a-rama. - Yeah, I tried to call you, but, um
Yeah, right!
give me six Schlitzes. - No Schlitz.
whatever's free. - Take it easy, Rod.
open bar, dude!
[ growling ] - Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
[ growling, Hooting Continue ]
hello down there. Are you okay?
[ hooting ]
excuse me.
Bear--Bear-fucker! - Yeah! Yeah!
do you need assistance? - Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah.
okay.
let's do this.
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!
mayor Timber, yeah. So I just wanted to let you know...
that the governor's gonna have to leave early.
for an emergency fund-raiser. So
Aw, she's gonna speak in about five minutes.
and then we're gonna have to zip on out of here.
[ timber ] Well, thanks for the heads-up. - I'll go check on those guys.
Mac-Attack! Wanna go punch for punch? [ Grunts, Laughs ]
good one! I did not specify.
never shit a shitter. [ Chuckles ] Lady in blue, comin' through.
[ phone Ringing ] - Ramathorn.
what? I don't know. Two minutes?
Yeah, yeah Well, I got a ticket to ride this rocket Whoo, sixteen ounces in my back pocket Well, come on, baby, won't you take a little taste 'Cause we're about to get on into outer space I got a ticket to ride on that rocket [ Retches ]
[ continues, Indistinct ]
you weren't kiddin'. That's a lot of hooch!
Whoo-hoo Yeah, hoo-hoo [ Applauding ]
[ thorny ] Holy shit. What's Grady doin' up there?
...and of course, your own local police chief, Bruce Grady...
has made yet another astonishing breakthrough...
in our state's War on Drugs.
that's fine police work. - [ Hooting, Cheering ]
[ Grady ] Thank you very much. The real credit goes to my skilled officers, who uncovered the marijuana in that Winnebago.
and, uh, we have identified the dead woman from that Winnebago...
as a drug "queenpin" from Louisville, Kentucky-- Lucy Garfield.
or, as we like to call her down at the station, "The Louisville Smuggler.
there will be no more running of marijuana...
through Spurbury on my watch.
you can count on that. -[ Applauding ]
[ Hooting, Screaming ]
Farva's number one! Farva's number one!
Hey! You showed Grady our secret stash? That was our stash!
I did not show Grady the stash! - Those bags of grass represented a-a bond of trust between us. - Foster
foster, I had no idea-- - Did you pick me because you could manipulate me?
No! How could you even say that?
because you crapped on my heart! - I what on your heart?
what are you gettin' out of this? Is Grady puttin' you on the road?
no, a-are you-- You're screwing him too.
asshole. - [ Buzzing, Sparking ] - Aah!
[ groaning ]
[ groaning Continues ] Ursula-- - [ Tires Screeching ]
Oh, Mac. - What the fuck?
fuckin' traitor!
Hey, Mac! Did it work? Did it work?
[ grunts, Shrieks ]
[ rabbit ] Was there ever a moment when you suspected her?
no, why would I? - Exactly.
why use your head when you can be getting some cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?
well, did you tell her anything?
two cops sleeping together. What the hell do you think they talked about?
I don't know. Doin' it? Positions and stuff?
Oh, shut up. You guys don't even know her.
get it through your head, fish dick. She was in on it. - Fuck you, Mac!
all right, all right. Fighting's not gonna change anything.
foster, she played you good. It's called the honey pot. You should have known better.
well, I guess they're gonna shut us down anyway.
but you two are friends, you know? You shouldn't let this come between you.
come on now. Shake hands.
sorry. - You should be.
Hey! - Sorry. - Sorry.
good, now. Who wants a shot? - I do.
I'll have one. - I said, who wants a shot?
I do! - Do you have any openings in Sherburne, Cap?
[ exhales ] Not for you guys. - Oh, come on.
we're like the sons you never had. - If you were my son, Mac...
I would have smothered you by now.
smothered me in gravy, you big, dirty man.
you put in for a transfer yet? - Ugh!
I applied for a guard job. At the post office.
[ foster ] Oh, man. - You'll finally get to shoot someone.
to the death of fun. - [ Mac ] Here's to you guys.
[ banging ]
[ banging ]
what's up, dirty dogs?
guess that's it for the old locker.
she stinks like ass, but I'll sure miss her.
I guess you can say that about all my girls.
what the fuck? - What the fuck to you too.
what are you? - I'm a cop. What are you?
a local cop? - Grady had an opening. Big deal.
why are you wearing that uniform in my station?
[ scoffs ] Look who's talkin', Denim Dan!
you look like the president, chairman and C. E.O. of Levi Strauss.
Where'd you get the Canadian tuxedo? [ Chuckling ]
you ratted us out to Grady.
[ scoffs ] I'm not even gonna dignify myself with a response to that.
Hey, I got no hard feelings. Nothin' a few beers can't fix, right?
Hey, how about one on me, Ramrod?
excuse me. Uh, excuse me, guys.
Yeah. I'll be right back.
what the fuck? - We should have taken him out the back and shot him.
aye, aye, Captain. - I gotta call Ursula.
fellas, we got to get him back. He's gotta pay for this.
[ all Agreeing ] - Nobody wears that uniform in my station.
Farva's goin' down! - Yes! Right!
Grady's goin' down! - [ All ] Yeah!
all of these fuckers are goin' down! - Yeah!
what? - [ Rock Guitar ]
[ muffled Screaming ]
[ siren Blaring, Cops Yelling ]
[ laughing ]
[ burger Kid ] Welcome to Dimpus Burger. May I take your order?
hello in there. This is Officer Rod Farva.
give me a liter of cola! - Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can't.
you want me to come in there, boy? I'll come in there!
Hello? -[ O'Hagan ] Chase him! Chase him!
[ laughing ] - Let's pull someone over.
Whoa!
[ siren Wailing ]
license and registration.
[ inhales Deeply ]
[ grunts ] -[ Urinates ]
[ urination Continues ]
when you gotta go, you gotta go.
[ siren Wailing ] - [ Laughing, Cheering ]
we are the Spurbury police!
Whoo! Hoo! Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
Whoo! - [ Laughing, Mumbling ]
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Grady! Get your ass out here!
Grady! - I don't want to sound like a wienie...
but I think I should call Ursula. - No way!
you sound like a fuckin' wienie. - [ Butler ] Gimme the radio.
Grady? Bruce?
fuck it, all right. Gimme the goddamn radio.
he's not home! - Hey, Chief-o!
this is Officer Rod Farva. Come in, Ursula.
[ foster ] What're you doin'? - Ursula! I love you, Ursula.
come in, Ursula! - Who is this? Hello?
Oh! Oh! -[ Rabbit ] Oh, she's there?
Ursula! Oh, I'm sorry.
sir, this is a police channel. Please get off of it.
I'm tryin' to apologize here. - Sir, this is not a civilian channel.
if you'd like to have a conversation with someone, please go to Channel Five.
[ foster ] All right, Thorny. Pop it over to Channel Five.
look what I found! A two-by-four!
you go, girl! -[ Ursula ] Foster!
help me out here, Rabbit. - Foster, is that you?
[ O'Hagan ] I need someone sober. -[ Rabbit ] You got it, Cap.
and, hit! - My ass in your face, Thorny.
[ clicks ] - So-So, hey, what's goin' on?
don't use that boyfriend voice with me. What are you doing?
[ mac ] Don't use that boyfriend voice with me, Foster!
hit! - Yea!
now, did you know that Farva was the one who told Grady about our plans?
Yeah. I know. He's working for us now. - So, I'm sorry.
I don't know. Can I come see you? - I love you.
listen, Foster-- - Ursula! I'm naked! [ Laughing ]
[ laughing ] - Listen, Foster? You want to get these guys back?
Yeah! - I know a way we can get 'em really good.
Yeah, let's get 'em good! Did you hear that, guys? - Yes, sir.
[ all Chattering ] - Okay, I get off work at 10: 30.
meet me at Route 9 and Okeechobee Road, and don't be late.
she said, "Okeechobee." - She's okey-dokey.
[ grunting ] -[ Glass Shattering ]
[ mac ] She's late.
so, Foster...
is this your usual meeting spot? - No.
[ brakes Hissing, Horn Blaring ]
fuckin' shit! - [ Mac ] That was Galikanokus!
let's get him! - [ Shouting, Screaming ]
[ siren Blaring ]
outta the car! Goddamn it!
same shit, different day, huh, Rabbit?
everybody outta the car! I said now!
you're all under arrest for stealing a Spurbury police vehicle.
no, Farva, you are under arrest for being a total and complete fuckhead!
y-you don't want to do this, Rod. We gotta go catch that truck.
using what? Super Citizen power?
Galikanokus is on that truck!
[ speaking With Irish Accent ] I'll believe that when me shit turns purple...
and smells like rainbow sherbet. - Does it sound like that when I say it?
Farva! You are not stopping me from getting my job back!
get him, Mac! - [ Groans ]
I got a job now. - You're a local cop.
you're goddamn right I am! - You ratted us out!
no, Thorny. I barely had a job before.
Farva, get the coffee. Farva, hit the radio.
Farva, clean the cells! I'm a cop, goddamn it!
I got my own car, now. I get to bust criminals!
it's what I gotta do!
you screwed us over. - No, Thorny.
okay. Okay, I did! I did, I did.
[ O'Hagan ] I'm sorry, Rodney. - Come on, Rod.
Oh, Thorny! - No, no, no. Please. Come on.
[ sobbing ] - Listen, listen. This is your big chance.
when we go up there, and we're wrong, no big deal.
but if we're right, you can be a hero.
come on. Team Ramrod!
[ foster ] Will you look at that?
we got 'em, Cap. - We got 'em, we got 'em!
Oh. - [ Mac ] Fuckin' Galikanokus!
[ O'Hagan ] There's Canadian markings on that plane.
okay, Foster. You and Rabbit come around in a classic pincer move.
mac, I need you to take-- - No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!
we outflank 'em, and we do, like, a submarine move.
team Ramrod? - Shut up, Farva.
[ mac ] Farva, you're leaning-- - [ Rabbit ] Wait a minute!
[ all ] Oh! The locals! I hate those fuckin' guys!
goddamn it, you dipshits! If I had my car, I'd have been in on this bust!
Shh! Rodney! Rodney, get your ass back here!
[ thorny ] Here we go again-- What the fuck?
Oh, did you see that? He kissed that guy! - Shh!
holy shit!
[ thorny ] God! We should have known.
so, wait. The local cops are selling Afghani grass to the Canadians?
assholes! -[ Thorny ] No, Rabbit, it's comin' in from Canada.
canadian grass. Ah!
assholes. - No!
the local mothers are running protection for' em.
[ sighs ] - Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.
[ surprised Shouts, Gasps ] - I'm sorry we didn't wait for you, but
listen to me, Foster. I need to tell you something.
what, are you guys drunk? - [ All, Chattering ] No!
your local buddies are runnin' grass! - Listen, I know.
I know what they're doing. I've known for awhile. - You know this?
wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you in on it?
No! They keep me on dispatch. I didn't know what to do when I found out about it.
I was afraid I'd lose my job. - Oh.
you should have just told us. We would have arrested them.
Yeah, we used to be cops, remember? Shh! - I remember
no offense, but the less you guys knew, the less you could screw up.
Oh. - I was trying to stop it without getting brought down.
th-that's why I helped you find the reefer, that's why I helped you guys steal the Winnebago...
and that's why I brought you...here tonight.
Ah! - You didn't do this because you like Foster? Shh!
no, I mean-- I do like Foster, but I
but you used him. - Yeah, I guess so. But I really like him now.
[ mac ] This is so good-- - This is kind of awkward.
I hate to break up the "like-fest," but it's prime time for crime-time!
but wait! Hey, hey, hey! Are you guys kidding? Look at yourselves.
you saw what they did to Galikanokus's girlfriend.
and you guys are drunk, and unarmed.
Oh, hey, I am sober as a bird. - [ Laughing ]
[ chuckling ] I am drunk.
[ ursula ] What do you got? - No guns. They got flares.
and some string.
Oh, Farva, you sad, lonely man.
Ugh. - Oh, wait. He's got your name written on it.
chief! Chief Grady! I secured the perimeter, sir. - Farva!
sorry I missed the call. Looks like we got 'em. Rock'n' roll!
what the hell are you doin' here, Farva? Put that pistol down!
Qu'est-ce-que c'est ca? - English!
chief! - Put a bullet in him, Grady.
[ man ] What the fuck is this? - [ Siren Wailing ]
Grady? - [ Man ] Shit, what the fuck is this?
shoot it! - [ Gunshots ]
that's my car. - [Voice Over P. A. ] Grady!
that's my girl! - Grady!
Smy, Burton, check that out.
[ screaming ]
what are ya, drunk? - Drunk enough to kick your ass.
let's see what you've got, O'Hagan.
[ laughing ] - [ Screaming ]
two-time Navy champion. Tag 'im and bag 'im!
way to go, Cap. - Give my regards to Bobby Baboon.
[ laughs, Swoons ]
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You haven't opened it yet, have ya?
how are ya doin'? - Hey, man. Hey, buddy.
[ bobbi ] Hi, John. - Hi, darlin'.
[ O'Hagan ] Here we go.
dear John...
congratulations are due to you...
and your men for your brave, impressive...
but most of all unorthodox tactics...
in thwarting the drug-smuggling ring...
and extreme police corruption.
Ooh. She loves us. - All right.
I cannot stress enough how proud we at the statehouse are of you.
the great state of Vermont could use more officers like your men.
as you requested, we have reevaluated the financial situation regarding your unit.
and we're gonna buy you a tank. - [ Chuckles ]
due to our tight fiscal situation...
we regret to inform you that we are still...
going to have to close your station.
good luck in Sherburne, John.
and give your men my best.
sincerely...
governor Fuckhead.
I did not see that coming.
[ grunts ] - I told you to bring the handcart.
sorry. - [ Groaning ] Tilt it.
Oh, goddamn, I remember these things being lighter!
I think I'm gonna drop a nut!
shit. - Hope they like foam.
[ both Grunting ] - It's not so bad. Good exercise.
cool uniforms. - Yeah. All the beer you can drink.
I'm into that! - [ Grunting ]
beer!
Oh, God. - You order the keg of St. Anky?
uh, yeah!
but aren't you guys the Highway Patrol?
Yeah, but our station got shut down, so
[ laughing ] Oh, no shit, man!
[ thorny ] Yeah, shit. This your keg?
Oh, my-my Dad ordered it. But he's asleep right now.
[ college Boy #2 ] Keg's here! [ Laughing ]
Oh, St. Anky's.
Oh, God. No! - No, no, no!
Hey, man. Hey, bro. It's cool, man. They got fired!
no shit?
[ guffawing ] No shit, man!
all right, all right. Where's the keg go? - Put it in the rec room, man.
make room, make room. What took you guys so long to get here?
What'd you do? Brew it yourself?
[ laughing ] I am cool. - You're cool, man.
check this out. Um, why don't you guys put that, um...over there?
[ snickering ] Move it, move it, move it. - We want a drink! Come on.
tap this thing! [ Laughing ]
actually, you know what? I think it's better...
feng Shui if it's, uh, over there.
[ college Boy #1 ] Definitely. Definitely better over there.
[ snickering ]
Oh, wait, wait. Guys. Guys. You know what?
man, it's probably better for the flow...
if you put it back over here.
[ sighs, Groans ]
and don't forget to tap that keg, guys.
okay, okay. Somebody's gonna need to sign for this...
and I need to see some I. D.
look, you know what? I don't have any I. D.
but, uh, Abraham Lincoln here, he says that I'm 21...
[ Chuckles ] and he never told a lie.
Yeah, actually it was George Washington that never told a lie.
you guys drive a hard bargain, but
actually, you know what?
why don't you guys split it?
[ laughing ] That was good, man.
are you ready for the fun part? - Oh, yeah.
cause here comes the fun part: Spurbury Police!
[ screaming ] - You're all under arrest!
[ screaming, Indistinct ]
come on back, now. - [ Mac ] Oh, yeah.
all this for a noise complaint?
[ door Slams ] - I love acid.
cops.
what the crap? How come nobody called me?
we're in trouble, aren't we? - Oh, yeah. You're in big trouble.
we're in trouble, aren't we? - Oh, yeah. You're in big trouble.
and if you really want to choke somebody, you gotta hit the Adam's apple.
like this? - [ Both Choking, Gagging ]
[ feedback ] - Loser!
I need to thank somebody who's here tonight.
when I had her at State... That didn't sound right.
I never had her. I wanted her, but never had her.
what I meant was when I took her class.
I had the worst case of writer's block in the world.
all I had were terrible ideas. I hated them all.
I was just about to drop the class when she said something to me that changed everything.
she said, "Terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats."
given the right encouragement, they grow up to be geniuses.
she told me to take one, and work on it.
well, I did.
Frances Mayes, who loves terrible ideas, may I please French kiss you now?
man: Go for it, Willie boy!
married, William. Sorry.
proud of me?
ridiculously.
Frances, these are amazing. What did you do?
chocolate is timing, my friend.
the rest is magic. - Hey, Professor.
where is the wine? - Over there.
Tom is one lucky bastard.
a literary wife who makes brownies.
I swear, if you tell me you cook in the nude,
I'll go home and kill myself.
never in the nude. Always in a thong.
actually, if you knew Frances, you'd know these are avoidance.
Thanks.
how's the novel going? - Not so well.
but the procrastination is coming along fabulously.
soon it will breed abject self-Ioathing, and then I'll just become a writing machine.
what about Tom? How's his book going?
fine. He's home writing right now.
you know Tom?
I met him recently, sort of by coincidence.
the other coincidence is that you reviewed a book of mine.
I did? Did I like it?
you didn't.
well, I'm sorry.
I'm sure there were a lot of other critics who loved it.
and I really hope you didn't take it personally.
you called my lead character "unrealistic."
I think bad reviews should just be forgotten.
give him a brownie.
I would like to give you this. It comes in peace.
you said you just couldn't get interested in a novel where the protagonist was a guy who spent all of his time living out his horny teenage fantasies.
I just find that ironic.
ironic. Why?
ask your husband.
what did he just say?
I've got some unfortunate news for you.
I just got off the phone with your husband's attorney, and they're going to pursue alimony.
how can we be talking about alimony when I hardly make enough money?
but you supported him during the marriage.
Yes.
but while he was researching and writing his book,
I worked while he pretended to be...
unfortunately, this is just about the math.
he was having an affair.
california's a no-fault state.
his attorney indicated your husband would prefer an alimony buy-out.
since you two were living rather modestly,
I don't think the number should be too bad.
they're probably talking about something like $200, 000.
I don't have that money.
unfortunately, you do.
the house?
its value went through the roof since you bought it.
and renovated it with my mother's money.
well, it's all community property now.
so he gets half the house and alimony.
there's leeway, and we'll make all the arguments we can.
but there is a bargaining chip. He wants the house.
he wants to keep living there? - Yeah.
and if you let him have it, you could end up with a lot of money in your pocket.
I understand he wants it pretty badly.
I'm sorry. This is so surreal.
how would he even find the money to buy me out of my half?
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
apparently, she likes the place.
it's near the right schools.
schools?
she's...
you're gonna get over this.
you will, Frances.
someday, you're gonna be happy again.
right.
and the desk?
the desk goes.
no, the desk can stay.
the couch? - Yes, please.
[Speaking Spanish]
wait a minute. No, the sofas can stay.
[Speaking Spanish]
how about the chairs?
they stay, too.
actually, everything's going to stay except those boxes.
those boxes with the books in them.
if you don't mind.
you're sure?
Yeah.
the bedroom?
Nope.
kitchen? - No.
[Speaking Spanish]
so then we're done.
we're done.
you getting a divorce?
it shows?
these are furnished, short-term apartments.
that's who we get.
your neighbor in 2-B. He's an attorney.
his divorce has been dragging on for three years.
nice guy.
gives free legal advice to the other tenants.
if his crying gets on your nerves, just bang on the wall.
he'll stop. - Sorry.
guy above you is a doctor. He hands out the sleeping pills.
what do you do? - I'm a writer.
so you can help the others with their suicide notes.
Wow.
you're one of those funny landlords.
not really.
well, here's your keys.
have a good stay.
Thanks.
home.
PATTI: Ta-da!
you start a marriage with cake and champagne.
finish it that way, too.
the beginning and the end should be fun, fun, fun.
too bad about those years in the middle.
sorry. - Make a wish.
things got crazy at the hospital.
Hi. You made it in time for the toast.
Bravo. And it only took a year.
to freedom. - To freedom.
Thanks.
you're not drinking. You're not drinking.
fifth time was a charm.
Oh, my God!
Patti! When are you due?
may. - May!
Oh, my God!
I'm going to be an auntie!
I'm going to be an auntie. Yes.
it changes our plans a bit.
well, of course.
we were about to take a 10-day tour to romantic Tuscany.
but I don't want Patti flying.
small sacrifice.
we decided to change our coach tickets into an upgraded ticket for you.
Oh.
this is amazing.
really generous.
thank you, but no.
how can you say no to Tuscany?
no. Like that.
that's your depression speaking.
it doesn't speak Italian. It speaks high-school French.
besides, I'm not depressed anymore.
then what are you still doing living with those losers?
those are my people. - That's not a place you live.
guys, come on.
thank you so much.
but there is no way I can go on a romantic tour of Tuscany.
I'm not ready to meet anyone. - You won't.
we can assure you. - Oh?
it's a gay tour of romantic Tuscany.
so it would be very relaxing for you.
you know, mostly couples.
no one would be there to hit on you.
and you could concentrate and listen to your own inner voice.
my inner voice?
my inner voice that would be saying, "What am I doing on a gay tour of Tuscany?"
Frances, it's Italy! Italy.
Plus, you could use it as a time to start writing.
well, I'm busy. I have to review all those books.
instead of working on your own book.
Wow.
are you being mean or just hormonal?
okay. Don't kill each other until I get back.
can we please just talk about the baby?
I think you're in danger.
of?
of never recovering.
you know when you come across one of those empty-shell people?
and you think, "What the hell happened to you?
well, there came a time in each one of those lives where they were at a crossroads.
crossroads. God, that is so "Oprah."
someplace where they had to decide to turn left or right.
this is no time to be a chickenshit, Frances.
I'm not being a chickenshit.
I'm not.
okay, promise me you'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
okay.
man: I got a feeling about you.
are you looking for a place? - Yeah, I guess.
you getting a divorce? - What?
we got short-term apartments.
but don't worry. Some stay for years.
we got a writer. We got a doctor.
the doctor could help you straighten out your life.
Hey!
sorry.
it's okay.
do you want to come over? - No!
maybe later.
maybe later. Oh!
Hello?
Patti, when do I leave?
Hi, I'm David. This is your driver, Eduardo.
and you are "Gay & Away"!
and welcome to your first day of a romantic tour of Tuscany.
now, I saw most of you getting to know each other on the plane.
but I wanted to make sure you've all met Frances.
woman: Hey, Frances.
now, Frances is straight. - Oh, poor girl.
and she just survived a terrible divorce.
and according to her friend Patti, she needs our support.
so, Frances, why don't you stand up, and let everyone say hello?
no. Come on.
Hi!
you're the bachelor, Frances. Have some fun!
okay, everyone, follow the flower.
good God, I cannot believe it is raining.
okay, everyone, we're here! Yeah! Okay!
Oops. Sorry.
david: You're empty. You need a little more?
Whoo! You want more wine?
little more vino? - Excuse me.
can a black gal get a drink? - Yes, she can.
Frances, little more?
Mm-hmm.
you've got to loosen up, honey. We having a party!
Buongiorno.
[Speaking Italian]
[Speaking Italian] - What?
[Speaking Italian]
Rodney: Pretty awesome, isn't it?
Yes, I think you could say that.
pretty awesome.
God, how am I gonna get through all of these?
I mean, how do you begin to describe all of this?
if you have a pen, I could write it for you.
are you a good writer?
I used to be.
all right.
well, have a go.
to my mom.
dear Mom.
FRANCES: Dear Mom.
it's market day in Cortona.
the piazza is an ongoing party, and everyone is invited.
clichés converge at this navel of the world.
you almost want to laugh, but you can't help feeling these Italians know more about having fun than we do.
I eat a hot grape from the market, and the violet sweetness breaks open in my mouth.
it even smells purple.
I wish I could stay longer, but the bell reminds me of time.
"Ding-dang-dong," the bell says, instead of "ding-dong."
I wish you were here. - Love...
Thanks.
it even smells like "purple"?
my mom will never believe I wrote this.
keep it. "Ding-dang-dong" goes the bell.
I'm sorry.
Bramasole.
it's a nice little villa. Rather run-down, but redeemable.
are you going to buy it?
no, no, no.
I'm just a tourist here for the day.
so?
well, who wouldn't want to buy a villa in Tuscany?
but the way my life's been going that would be a terrible idea.
a terrible idea.
Mm-hmm.
don't you just love those?
sorry, everybody. Unscheduled stop.
look at the sheep. Oh, my gosh.
stop the bus!
stop the bus!
Hello?
Hello?
shit.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry. [Speaking Italian]
can I help you, signora?
Yes, I thought the house was for sale.
Oh, no. The house is for sale.
but, unfortunately, someone's already buying it.
we like it very much, and we'll buy it today.
very good. One moment please.
excuse me.
they want it. They agree on the price.
so soon? Then we asked too little.
ask for 20 million lire more, at least.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that there has been a change in the price.
it is now 20 million lire more expensive.
woman: Why? It didn't get more valuable in five minutes.
the contessa feels she has asked too little since you agreed to buy it.
man: That logic is absurd.
excuse me?
what is the price?
are you bidding against us?
wait. We accept the new price.
no, this is a beautiful house.
and whoever wants it has to pay double.
the contessa says that since there is so much interest in the house, the price is now double.
since the last 10 seconds?
normale.
you greedy Americans. You think you're so entitled.
you ruin everything.
a lot of us feel really badly about that.
we're going. We'll look in Provence.
fascists!
and her? How much will she pay?
we'll see.
is it really double the price?
[Speaking Italian]
I can't pay double the price.
but please tell the contessa that this is what I got for my house recently in dollars.
[Speaking Italian]
minus the work on the place.
hammers, buckets.
men.
chocolate.
and a rental car to drive off a cliff when this all turns out to have been a terrible mistake.
that's what I can pay.
Signora.
you've not even seen the house.
Oh.
well.
well, I...
I can't go back to San Francisco.
CONTESSA: No.
no.
I'm sorry, signora.
the contessa's family lived here for generations, so understandably it is very difficult for her to sell.
money is not the only issue. She needs...
[Speaking Italian]
a sign.
I understand. I believe in signs, too.
well, thank you. Thank you.
Oh!
Oh. - Oh.
please.
[Speaking Italian]
what did she say?
in Italy, what happened to you is a very good sign.
it is? - Yes.
and now... would you like to see the house?
first, we open an account. Then you transfer the money.
here is the legal description. "Two oxen, two days."
I'm sorry. - It's old-fashioned.
the land is measured by how long it would take two oxen.
Oh. Oh, that makes sense.
just like that?
before the money's been transferred?
it's a house, not a Vespa.
what are you going to do, steal it?
besides, Signor Martini likes you.
okay. We'll take care of the rest later.
normale.
Normale?
normale.
normale.
FRANCES: I have bought a house in a foreign country.
a house and the land it takes two oxen two days to plow.
not having a plow or an ox,
I'll have to take their word on that.
buyer's remorse is a very common affliction among new homeowners.
just because you have a sudden urge to weep, that doesn't mean you've made a mistake.
everybody knows old houses have their quirks.
especially 300-year-old houses.
I have inherited 10, 000 empty wine bottles, one grape, every issue of "La Nazione" printed in 1958, and assorted previous tenants.
Ugh! [Screaming]
the trick to overcoming buyer's remorse is to have a plan.
pick one room and make it yours.
go slowly through the house.
be polite, introduce yourself, so it can introduce itself to you.
you did what?
Frances bought a house in Tuscany!
and you're gonna live there alone?
well, I'm not there alone. I'm there with bugs.
how's the belly? - It's growing.
I can't believe you did this. Did you already sign?
Yes.
Why? What? You think I shouldn't have?
are you telling me I made a mistake?
I don't know. Did you? - Well, I don't know.
you're the one who made the "empty-shell person" speech.
Oh, yeah. That was me.
okay. Wow!
you bought a villa in Tuscany!
so, what's the place like? - It needs a little work.
well, who's gonna do it? - I am.
you are?
I never realized you were so handy.
I can do things. Remember, I fixed that drain?
the drain in your kitchen? No, that was me.
I handed you the rubber thingy.
the plunger? That was Tom.
I can't believe it. Why did you just say his name?
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'm sorry.
I can make this work. You know?
of course I didn't mean I was gonna do all the work myself.
I can hire the descendents of Roman gods to do the heavy lifting.
then, just supervise, tell them what to do.
so, have you met him yet?
who? - The guy you're gonna meet.
Patti, please.
you know what?
it's starting to rain here a little bit.
so I think I have to go now. - Wait, Fran.
I want you to kiss the belly for me.
Fran. - Bye-bye.
can you Star-69 Italy?
no.
I'm gonna try.
Hello?
okay.
one 1, 000, - 2... Aah! - [Thunder crashes]
Jesus!
okay.
stop it.
stop it. - [Screeching]
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
you're gonna be okay. You're safe here.
just don't fly around, okay? You'll freak me out.
Oh, God.
Signora?
Signora Mayes?
Buongiorno.
I see you have survived the storm.
I'm alive. But the washing machine is dead.
Yes. It was electrocuted.
I'm happy to see that you were not.
you came to check on me?
you're meeting the contractors today, and I came to help you.
I believe one of them is here.
here?
downstairs.
Oh.
Oh, yeah. He's here.
I was hoping to take this wall down and return these two small rooms into one big room.
Oh, wonderful.
you should have been an architect.
you have excellent taste.
so, do you think it can be done?
hidden pipes, a week.
the bathrooms, 3 days.
Signora, give me the keys of this place, and in one month, I will give you the keys to your palace.
just...
just leave it to me.
Oh.
Oh!
[speaks Italian]
[Speaking Italian]
he says he fixed it himself many years ago.
Really?
Oh. You want to see the rest of the house?
okay. Yes, yes.
[Speaking Italian]
he suggest that he rebuild the wall.
[Speaking Italian]
it is important for the structure of the garden.
[Speaking Italian] - He has a team of experts.
Buongiorno.
Hello, miss.
we are not Italian. We are from Polonia.
Poland. Oh. Do you all speak English?
only me. And only a little.
I am Pawel.
Oh, Pawel. Nice to meet you.
Buongiorno.
hello.
what do you think of Nino?
I know his mother. If he does a bad job, he's...
well, then.
okay. Yes.
okay. Yes.
Yes, yes.
okay. Yes.
see, Frances? No problem.
Oh, God!
[Shouts in Italian]
run! Oh! Aah!
okay. Yes.
[speaks Polish]
"Kurwa mac" means "holy shit" in Polish.
I learned that that day.
the fact I'm trying to speak Polish in Italy is just one of the many surprises around here.
is he a licensed electrician?
no. He's a licensed literature professor.
Oh.
I like him.
it is only natural getting to know people should take time.
every day I watch for the old man with the flowers.
and I wonder, was he born here?
did he love someone here?
did he lose someone here?
he doesn't seem as curious about me, but that's all right.
these days, I'm something of a Ioner myself.
I'm pretty good at staying entertained.
mostly, I like to hang out at a bar I know conveniently located in my backyard.
fortunately, there are things here you can't do alone.
it's my neighbor Placido who's teaching me about olives.
today is okay.
but never pick when it's wet, huh?
okay.
these look good.
Oh, my God.
Papà! - Si?
I'm finished. - Good. Gather up the net.
okay.
Chiara! - Si?
go and see if Gianni needs some help.
okay.
go, go.
Ciao.
oops!
everything okay?
Si.
Grazie.
Francesca? Are you busy tonight?
no.
then come to dinner. It's unhealthy to eat alone.
stop it, Mom. It's embarrassing.
is she okay? - Of course. She's fine.
mama, that's enough.
my granny's very sensitive.
she cries all day.
are we celebrating something in particular?
gratitude to the saints for saving us from droughts, mad dogs, and glandular disorders.
good evening, everybody. Sorry I'm late.
Katherine! Hand me your hat.
do you like it?
I suppose it wasn't a terrible idea, buying a villa.
are you up there all alone? No lord and master, no consort?
no. Do you have one?
one? Ha!
[Grandmother speaks Italian]
I knew this would happen. Remember?
don't blame me.
I told him not to get her that computer.
she got an e-mail lover, you see, from Ecuador.
finally, she had to tell him her age.
no mail!
you had it coming.
you're wrong. I hurt in my heart.
even though I'm old, my heart still aches.
I'm so sorry.
L'amore. - Si.
[speaks Italian]
Si.
[speaks Italian] - Hmm?
[speaks Italian]
celibate?
celibate! - Si.
no. I mean...
well, actually, I have to admit it has been a while.
"Celibe" in Italian means "single."
he's not asking when you last had sex.
he's asking whether or not you're married.
thank you.
no, I'm not.
everything all right, darling? - Oh, terrific. I'm just eating.
he is.
Oh, my God.
I feel like such an idiot. - Don't.
flirting's a ritual in Italy. Just enjoy it.
taste this. It's gorgeous.
Mmm!
how do you do it? - Do what?
this.
well, hats make me happy.
and ice cream.
ice cream changed my fate.
it was because of ice cream that my beloved Fefe discovered me.
II Maestro.
who?
federico, darling.
he discovered me in the Piazza Novena with my parents eating an ice cream.
I was gobbling it down, letting it run all over my chin because I was hungry.
do you like ice cream?" He asked me.
I didn't know who he was. I was 16.
"you are my imagination come to life," he told me.
he wasn't just a great director. He gave great advice.
I'm listening.
Fefe said you have to live spherically in many directions.
never lose your childish enthusiasm, and things will come your way.
so now I was getting posthumous advice from II Maestro, and I tried to follow it by pulling ivy, spherically and with childish enthusiasm.
Oh, my God.
niente qui.
niente. Not here.
did you look under the bed?
could you look under the pillow?
huh!
no. It's a joke.
maybe he moved out already.
snakes are famous for changing their minds.
what am I doing here all by myself?
don't you think it's strange?
me in this big house?
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
you are cold, Signora Mayes.
Yeah.
thank you.
do you know the most surprising thing about divorce?
it doesn't actually kill you, like a bullet to the heart or a head-on car wreck.
it should.
when someone you've promised to cherish till death do you part says, "I never loved you," it should kill you instantly.
you shouldn't have to wake up day after day after that, trying to understand how in the world you didn't know.
the light just never went on, you know.
I must have have known, of course, but I was too scared to see the truth.
then fear just makes you so stupid.
no. It's not stupid, Signora Mayes.
Oh, love is blind. Yeah, we have that saying, too.
everybody has that saying because it's true everywhere.
I don't want to be blind anymore.
this house has three bedrooms.
what if there's never anyone to sleep in them?
and the kitchen, what if there's never anyone to cook for?
I wake up in the night thinking, "You idiot."
I mean, you're the stupidest woman in the world.
you bought a house for a life you don't even have.
why did you do it, then?
because I'm sick of being afraid all the time and because I still want things.
I want a wedding in this house, and I want a family in this house.
Signora, between Austria and Italy, there is a section of the Alps called the Semmering.
it is an impossibly steep, very high part of the mountains.
they built a train track over these Alps to connect Vienna and Venice.
they built these tracks before there was a train in existence that could make the trip.
they built it because they knew someday the train would come.
I think your snake has gone for the evening.
Yes. I think you're right.
Signora.
please stop being so sad.
if you continue like this,
I will be forced to make love to you.
and I've never been unfaithful to my wife.
Buonanotte, signora.
Yes. Buonanotte, Signor Martini.
Grazie.
a train track through the Alps before there was a train.
Signor Martini wants me to have faith.
something I've never been good at, and now I'm even worse at.
not that I don't want faith. I'm jealous of the believers.
but as a fallen-away Methodist,
I do not expect to emerge from all of this a Catholic, although I admit some interior juggling is going on.
to my surprise, I have become friendly with Mary.
it started the night she stood by me through the storm, knowing full well I'm not a Catholic.
yet, somehow, she seems more like Mary, my favorite aunt, than Santa Maria.
aunt Mary is everywhere here, her calm presence assuring us that all things will go on as they have before.
buon Natale.
buon Natale.
this is my wife, Flora.
Oh!
and my daughter, Stella.
Stella, buon Natale.
Bellissima.
what a beautiful family.
Wow.
I thought I might see you, so I have a gift for you.
it is San Lorenzo.
he is the patron saint of cooks.
apparently, he was martyred on a grill and seared until he said, "Turn me over. I'm done on this side."
No!
Yes. And now he is the favorite saint of chefs.
Oh!
I think if you prayed to him, he will help you find someone to cook for.
thank you, Signor Martini.
merry Christmas, Signora.
buon Natale.
[Speaking Italian]
my prayers to San Lorenzo were quickly answered.
I realized I already had someone to cook for.
plenty of someones.
Bravo! - Ahh!
Bravo! - Bravo!
Bravo!
Aah!
Aah!
[Speaking Italian]
good. - See, Frances? Italian is easy.
[Speaking Italian]
[Speaking Italian]
No!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
have you talked to her yet?
Si.
I have talked to her.
why don't you go sit next to her? Go on.
okay.
Francesca! Come up!
I'm having my portrait painted.
come through. I'm in here.
Oh.
I'll come back another time. - Why? You don't bother me.
Frances, this is Zeus.
he's an art student from Macedonia.
he's staying with me while he's studying the Tuscan light.
more vino, darling.
hmm.
he's not bad.
he's not good, either.
look, I'm going to go, but I'll come back another time.
Oh, you're so boring!
what?
I said you're boring.
look at you!
you're sad.
again!
you're like a big black hole.
excuse me, but I...
Fefe always said, "Regrets are a waste of time.
they're the past crippling you in the present.
I just walked in the door.
how are you ever going to be happy if you keep wallowing?
listen, when I was a little girl,
I used to spend hours looking for ladybugs.
finally, I'd just give up and fall asleep in the grass.
when I woke up, they were crawling all over me.
so?
so go work on your house and forget about it.
I said go!
I'm going!
work on the house and forget about it.
gee, why hadn't I thought of that?
there comes a time in every remodeler's life when one doesn't want any more helpful advice.
there comes a time when you no longer want shaky guys staring at you thinking God knows what, whispering things in Polish you're really glad you don't understand.
[Speaking Polish]
there's only so much you can take before there comes a time when you just have to get out.
[Speaking Italian]
Signorina.
great.
hilarious.
goodbye!
you are American?
English? Irish?
there you are. I've been looking for you.
you said you were gonna meet me.
I've been looking for you for 20 minutes.
who are you? - I'm sorry.
mi scusi. Thank you.
wait. You just kissed me and you're going?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
okay.
you are too late.
well, I mean, is anything autobiographical?
we all see the world through our own tiny keyhole, right?
I mean, I always think of Thomas Wolfe, you know, if you ever seen that little one page note to reader in the front of "Look Homeward, Angel," you know what I'm talking about?
anyway, he says that we are the sum of all the moments of our lives, and that anybody who sits down to write is gonna use the clay of their own mind, that you can't avoid that.
so when I look at my own life, you know, I have to admit, right...that I've...
I've never been around a bunch of guns, or violence.
you know, not really.
no political intrigue or... helicopter crash, right?
but my life, from my own point of view, has been full of drama, right?
and, so, I thought that if I could write a book that...
...that could capture what it's like to really meet somebody.
I mean the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me is to really meet somebody, make that connection, and if I could...
..make that valuable, you know, to capture that, that would be the attempt or...
did I answer your question?
I'll try to be more specific...
were there ever a French young woman on the train you met, and... spent an evening with?
see, to me, that...
that's not important, you know?
so that's a "yes."
all right, since I'm in France and this is last stop in my book tour, "yes."
Mr. Wallace, the book ends on an ambiguous note.
we don't know!
do you think they get back together in six months, like they promise each other?
like they promised, uh...
I think I answered that. You know, it's...
it's a good test.
right? If you're a romantic or a cynic.
I mean, you think... you think they get back together, you don't, for sure, so you're asking the question.
and... do you think they get back together?
I mean, did you, in real life?
did I real...
look, see, in the words of my grandfather, ok...
to answer that, would take the piss out of the whole thing.
Oh, no...
we just have the time for one last question.
what is your next book?
I don't know, man, I don't know...
I've been...
I've been thinking about this...
well, I always kind of wanted to write a book that all took place within the space of a pop song, you know, like 3 or 4 minutes long.
the story, the idea is that...
there's this guy.
and...
he's totally depressed!
I mean, his great dream was to be a lover, an adventurer, you know, riding motorcycles through South America, and instead he's sitting at a marble table, eating lobster, and he's got a good job and a beautiful wife, right.
you know, everything that he needs.
but that doesn't matter, 'cause what he wants is to fight for meaning.
you know, happiness is in the doing, not in the...
getting what you want.
so, he's sitting there, and just at a second, his little five year old daughter hops up on the table.
and he knows that she should get down 'cause she could get hurt, but she's dancing to this pop song, in a summer dress.
and he looks down, and all of a sudden, he is sixteen.
and... his high school sweetheart is dropping him off, at home.
and they've just lost their virginity, and she loves him, and the same song is playing on the car radio, and she climbs up and starts dancing on the roof of the car.
and now, now he's worried about her!
and she is beautiful, with a...
a facial expression just like his daughters'.
in fact, you know, maybe that's why he even likes her.
you see, he knows he's not remembering this dance, he's there.
he's there in both moments simultaneously.
and just like for an instance, all his life is just folding into itself and it's obvious to him that time is a lie...
that's it's all happening all the time and inside every moment is another moment, all...
you know, happening simultaneously.
and, anyway, that's kind of the idea... Anyway.
well, our author has to be going to the airport soon, so he'll thank you all very much for coming here this afternoon.
and a special thanks to Mr. Wallace for being with us.
we hope to see you again here on your next book!
Merci a toutes et a tous qu'etre venus.
comme vous voyez y a du champagne, y a des petites choses, donc servez vous.
thank you all.
how much longer before I have to go to the airport?
Oh, you should leave at 7: 30.
7: 30 at the very latest!
OK.
Hi.
hello.
how are you?
good, and you?
I'm good, yeah, I'm great, I'm...
do you want...
maybe get a cup of coffee?
didn't you just say you have a plane to catch?
uh, yeah...
but, I mean, I have a little time.
okay.
I'll meat you outside, okay.
I'm just gonna go out, get a cup of coffee,
Yeah, I sure did.
well, get your driver Philippe's card so that you can call on the cell phone if you're running late.
and we will put your bags in the car so you are not late going to the airport.
thanks for everything. Merci beaucoup.
which one's Philippe?
philippe, passe lui ta carte pour qu'il le forme numero portable.
Merci.
I can't believe you're here!
well, I live here in Paris.
are you sure you don't have to stay, you're not suppose to talk some more?
no, no, no, they sicken me,
I spent the night here last night.
Oh, you did?
Yeah, yeah, they've got a waft upstairs...
anyway, how are you? This is so weird.
I'm fine, it's...
it's good to see you!
it's good to see you.
so you wanna go to a cafe?
uh, yeah...
okay, there's one a little further, that I like.
I thought I was gonna totally loose it in there.
when I first saw you...
I mean, how did you even know I was going to be here?
well, it's my favorite bookstore in Paris. I...
you can sit down for hours and read...
I love it.
there's flees, but, you know...
I know, I think a cat slept at my head last night.
so, I saw your picture on the calendar about a month ago, and that you were going to be here.
it's funny because I read an article on your book, it sounded vaguely familiar...
vaguely, yeah...
Yes.
but I didn't put it all together until I saw your photo, so...
did you have a chance to read it?
Yes, I...
I was really, really surprised as you can imagine, I mean...
I had to read it twice, actually.
yeah?
Yeah.
comme Si, Comme Ca?
no, I liked it!
it's very romantic, and I usually don't like that...
but it's, it's really well written.
it's really well written, no, I really... Congratulations!
wait!
before we go any anywhere, I have a...
I have to ask you...
sure, what?
did you show up in Vienna, that December?
uh, did you?
no, I couldn't, but...
did you? I need to know, it's important to me!
why, if you didn't?
well, did you?
no.
Oh, thank God you didn't!
well, thank God you...
I mean, thank God I didn't, and you didn't!
I mean, one of us had shown alone...
and that would have sucked.
I know, I know, I was so concerned with that.
I always felt horrible about not being there, but I couldn't!
you know, my grandma died a few days before, and she was buried that day.
december 16th, that day!
she died, the one in Budapest?
Yes, you remember that?
Yeah, I remember everything.
of course, it wasn't in your book.
but anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna, you know,
and I... and we heard the news about her, and of course I took her to the funeral with my parents.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I know.
you weren't there anyway...
Why?
why weren't you there?
I would have been there if I could have,
I made plans, and we...
you better have a good reason!
what?
Oh, no!
no, you were there, weren't you?
Oh, no, that's terrible!
I know I'm laughing, but I don't mean it!
did you hate me? You must stop hating me.
have you been hating me all this time?
you have!
no, no... - Yes, you have!
Oh, but you can't hate me now, right?
I mean, my grandma... - I don't hate you, all right?
come on, it's no big deal, all right?
I flew all the way over there, you blew the thing off, and then my life has been a big nose dive since then, but it's not a problem.
no, you can't say that! No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding...
Oh, I can't believe it, you must have been so angry with me...
I'm so sorry, I really wanted to be there, more than anything in the world! I swear...
honestly, I swear...
I mean, you can't be angry... my grandmother...
no, I know, I know,
I honestly thought that something like that might have happened.
I was definitely bumped, but...
mostly, I was jut mad we hadn't exchanged any phone numbers or any information.
I know, that was so stupid, no way to get in touch.
I didn't even know your last name - I know, I know...
I mean we were both afraid that if we started writing and calling, that it would slowly...
you know, fade out.
Yeah, it definitely wasn't a slow fade. - No, it sure wasn't.
I know, we wanted to pick it up were we left off.
which would have been fun if it worked... - Yes, a good idea...
ahh, so...
how long were you in Vienna, then?
just a couple of days.
did you meet another girl?
Aah, yeah. Her name was Gretchen, and she was amazing.
you did? Yeah, the book is really a composite of the two of you.
Really? Oh, no... No, I'm kidding!
you wouldn't believe it, I even went back to the train station.
I put up, you know, signs of my number, and the hotel, in case you've been delayed. I was a total dork.
let's go this way. Did you get any calls?
just a couple hookers, looking for a gig.
no, it was awful. What do you want me to say...
Oh, it's so sad. I'm so sorry!
I walked around for a couple of days. Eventually, I flew home,
I owed my dad 2000 bucks, who had warned me about French chicks, I have to say.
what did he tell you about French women?
nothing, the guy... he's never met any French women.
he's never been east of the Mississippi.
so why didn't you put "Six months later, the French bitch didn't have show up.
you know, like... But I did, I did.
you did? - Yeah, no, I mean I made it more hopeful.
I wrote this whole fictional version in which you actually do show up.
Oh, what happens? - Uhm...
what?
uhm, we make love for about ten days straight, that's one part of it.
Oh, that's interesting. So, the French slut...
yeah - Ok, ok...
it's just, then they, you know, they start to know each other better and they realize that they don't get along at all.
I like that. It's more real.
Yeah, well, my editor didn't think that way.
no, everyone wants to believe in love. It sells, right?
Yeah, exactly...
so things are going well for you, right?
I mean, your book is a best seller in the US..
it's a tiny best-seller. - Oh, come on...
all right, yeah, officially, yes, but I mean all those people haven't read Moby Dick, you know, so why should they read my book?
I haven't read Moby Dick, and I liked your book, so...
nice.
you know, I thought you idealized the night a bit.
Oh, come on, it's officially fiction...
I mean, I'm supposed to... - No, no, I know, I know.
I know, I thought...
you know, there were times when you made me a...
huh, I mean her, right?
no, me... Ok, whatever!
Ah... a little bit neurotic!
you are a little bit like that, aren't you?
you think I'm neurotic? - No, no, no, come on, I'm kidding!
where did I do that? I didn't do that.
maybe it's just me you know...
reading something knowing that the character in the story is based on you...
it's both flattering and disturbing at the same time.
how is it disturbing?
I don't know, just... being part of someone else's memory.
seeing myself through your eyes.
how long did it take you to write it?
uhm, 3 or 4 years, on and off.
wow, that's a really long time to be writing about one night!
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
I always assumed you had forgotten me.
no, I had a pretty clear picture of you in my mind.
I have to tell you something.
I just... - What?
I wanted to talk to you for so long, you know, now that...
Yeah, me too.- ...it's just so real, you know,
I feel I can't get anything out of my mouth.
I know, I know, how long do we have? 20 minutes and 30 seconds?
let's go! No, we got more than that.
I wanna know about you.
tell what are you doing... you know, what are you up to?
uhm, where to start... I work for Green Cross.
it's an environmental organization. - What are they all about?
well, we basically work on different environment issues, from clean water to disarmament of chemical weapons.
you know, international laws that deal with the environment.
and, and, what do you do for them? We're going this way.
uhm, different things.
like last year, I was in India for quite a while, working on a water treatment plant.
Wow! - Well, yeah, the cotton industry there is a major source of pollution, so...
I mean, this sounds like you're actually doing something, you know,
I mean, most people, myself included, just...
sit around and bitch, you know,
america's consuming all the world resources, SUVs suck, global warming is real...
you know, I'm really relieved you're not one of those
freedom Fries kind of Americans.
Hey, you know... But, how did you get into that?
Ah, I came out of political science and I was hoping to work for the government.
and I did, for a while... eh, terrible!
not good? - Yeah, no.
anyway, I got really tired... let's go this way ... of having those endless conversations with friends about how the world is falling to pieces.
so I decided what I really wanted to do was to find things that could be fixed, and try to fix them, you know?
I always thought you'd be doing something cool like that.
I did! - Thanks!
I just... no, really, really like you to be doing a job that I like.
you know, I actually alternated between thinking that...
you know, everything is irrevocably screwed up, and that things might be getting better in some ways.
better? How could you possibly say that?
well, I just mean, you know... I mean, I know it sounds weird, but there are things to be optimistic about.
okay... I know the book you're selling, which is great, I'm very happy for you, but...
let me break the news for you, ok?
the world is a mess right now! - I wasn't saying that...
OK, we're moving all our industry to developing nations.
we can get cheap labor free of any environmental laws.
OK, the weapon industry is booming,
five million people die every year for preventable water disease.
so, how is the world getting any better?
I'm not getting angry, I'm not getting angry, but...
come on, I want to know, I'm interested!
OK, I realize that there are a lot of serious problems in the world.
OK, thank you! - I mean, I don't even have one publisher in the whole Asian market.
OK, all right. Say "stop it"!
what, what? "Stop."
no, look, all I'm saying is that there's more awareness out there, right?
people are going to fight back!
you know, I mean I think the world might be getting better because people like you are educated into speaking out.
even the very notion of conservation, environmental issues, those weren't even in the vocabulary until fairly recently, and now they're becoming a norm, and eventually might be what's expected all over the world!
I agree with what you're saying, but at the same time, it's dangerous!
an imperialist country can use that kind of thinking to justify the economy greed. You know, human rights...
a particular imperialistic country you have in mind there, Frenchy?
no, not really Bon soir!
bon soir.
so, you want to sit over there?
Yeah, this is perfect.
Oh, wow, maybe what I'm saying is the world might be evolving the way a person evolves.
right, I mean... me, for example am I getting worse?
am I improving? I don't know!
when I was younger...
I was healthier, but I was racked with insecurity.
now I'm older, my problems are deeper, but I'm... more equipped to handle them.
so, what are your problems?
right now? I don't have any.
I don't. Just...
...damn happy to be here!
me too.
so, how long have you been in Paris?
I got in last night. I've done 10 cities in 12 days,
I'm a wreck... I'm so glad it's over.
I'm tired of being a hugster.
Ques-ce que je vous serve?
what do you want?
a cup of coffee...
un cafe et un citrone, s'il vous plait.
God, I love this cafe. I wish they had places like this in the US.
Yeah, I missed cafes when I was living over there.
I mean, I find a few places I really liked, but there was...
you... You were living in the US?
Yes, from... '96 to '99.
I was studying at NYU.
Oh, God, don't tell me that, Celine!
what? - No, it's just...
nothing, I mean I... - What?
I've been living in New York since '98.
you know, we were there at the same time!
in New York? - Yeah...
Oh, that's weird...
it actually crossed my mind a few times that I might run into you, but...
the odds are so slim, right? So...
I didn't even know what city you were living in.
weren't you somewhere in Texas?
you were in Texas... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
definitely, I just... I was for a long time, I just...
you know, wanted to try New York.
what brought you back here?
I had finished my masters, for one. And... no visa. No more visa.
and, anyway, I was starting to get paranoid.
all... the violence in the medias. Gang violence, murders...
especially serial killers.
but, the final stroll was: One night I heard a...
some noise on my fire escape, so I called 911.
and the cops came, eventually. - Yeah, like 3 hours later.
Yeah, after I had been raped and killed about 30 times.
no, but... It was a man and a woman officer, and I was explaining to them what I had heard, when the woman had to run downstairs to move the police car.
so, I was left alone with the male cop.
and right away, he asked me if I had a gun...
and I said no, of course not, I...
and he told me: "You better think about getting one.
this is America, not France." Okay?
and I said to him, you know, I have no idea how to shoot a gun, and, I have no interest in firearms, whatsoever.
and that's when he pulled out his gun, like this...
and he went:
on one day... you're gonna have something like this in your face, and if you wanna have a long life, you're gonna have to choose...
between you... alone.
and they left... And the next morning I called for an application to get a gun.
me, with a gun! I mean, that's really scary...
but then I realized something was wrong, the way that cop had pulled out his gun out, and everything...
so I canceled my demand for the gun, and...
and I called the police station, and tried to complain about that cop's behavior, but...
what happened with that? - It was so much paperwork...
and then I got scared, with my shity student desire.
Yeah, you thought you'd get deported. - Yeah, exactly!
so I gave up and I forgot about the whole thing.
well, I guess I never forgotten. - Obviously... yeah.
but, still, you know... I really enjoyed being there.
there's a lot of things I miss about the US.
Yeah, like what?
well...
the overall good mood people have there,
like, you know, even if it can be bullshit sometimes.
like "How you doin'?" "Great!" "How you doing?" "Great!
have a perfect day!
I don't know...
Parisians can be so grumpy, have you noticed?
no, everybody seems pretty happy to me.
they're not happy... - They're not happy.
no, they are, I don't know. Maybe I just meet French men...
they drive me nuts!
what is it? What about them?
well, they're very nice. They're great, you know, to be around, they love food, wine. They're great cooks...
but, I don't know, maybe I've had really bad luck with them.
Why? What do you mean?
uhm, well...
I guess they're not as ... - What?
what's the word?
uhm...
horny?
they're not as horny... - Horny?
all right, well, listen to me on this one,
in that regard, I'm proud to be an American.
and you should be, in that regard only.
Merci.
have you ever spent some time in Eastern Europe?
eastern? No, no...
no?
I remember as a teenager I went to Warsaw, when it was still a strict communist regime.
which I don't approve of at all.
sure you don't...
no, I do... -No, I'm just kidding!
but, anyway, something about being there was very interesting, I found.
after a couple of weeks, something changed in me.
the city was quite gloomy and gray...
but, after a while, my brain seemed clearer.
I was writing a lot more in my journal, ideas I never thought of before.
communist ideas?
listen, I'm not... - I'm sorry, I can't...
go on!
I'll send you to a Gulag!
no... But, it took me a while to figure out why it felt, you know, so different.
and then, one day, as I was walking through the Jewish cemetery,
I don't know why, but it occurred to me there,
I realized that I had spent the last 2 weeks away from most of my habits.
TV was in a language I didn't understand,
so, all I've been doing was...
walk around, thinking right!
my brain felt like it was at rest, free from the consuming frenzy.
and I have to say, it was almost like a natural high.
I felt so peaceful inside, no... strange urge to be somewhere else, to shop...
maybe it could have seemed like boredom at first, but it quickly became very, very sore full.
it's interesting, you know?
can you believe that it was 9 years ago that we were walking around Vienna?
nine years? No that's impossible...
it was, it feels like two months ago to me, but it was summer '94.
do I look any different?
I do?
I'd have to see you naked.
what? - I'm sorry...
your hair was different back then, it was like...
what, it's the same... - Take it down, let's see!
down, it was down. - Yeah.
OK.
well, voila!
so?
OK, come on, tell me.
skinnier, I think, more thinner.
did you think I was fat before?
no.
Yeah, you thought I was a fatty. No, you thought I was a fatty...
you wrote a book about a fat French girl!
Oh, no. - Seriously, all right, you look beautiful.
do I look any different?
no.
no, no real... oh, actually, you have this line.
I know. - Looks like a scar.
a scar? What, a gun shot wound?
no, no, no, I lied to you, I'm sorry.
I had this funny... well, horrible dream the other day.
I was having this awful nightmare, that I was 32, and then I woke up, and I was 23!
so relieved...
and then I woke up for real, and I was 32.
scary! - It happens.
Yeah, time goes faster and faster.
apparently, it's because we don't renew our synapses live to 20.
so, it's pretty much downhill from then on.
I like getting older, you know, it feels...
I don't know, it feels more immediate.
you know, like I can appreciate things more.
no, me too, actually. I really love it.
I was once a...
...a drummer in a band.
you were?
Yeah, we were pretty good, actually.
but the lead singer guy, he was just so obsessed with us getting a record deal.
you know, it's all we talked about, it was all we thought about, getting bigger shows, and everything was just... focus on the future, all the time!
and now, the...
... band doesn't even exist anymore.
right, I'm looking back at the... at the shows we did play, even rehearsing, ... it was so much fun!
now I'd be able to enjoy every minute of it.
can I have a trier?
well, your book has been published, that's...
that's pretty big deal, and you've been all around Europe with it.
are you enjoying every minute of it?
not really... - Not really?
do you have another one of those?
Yes, of course.
here.
in my field, I see these people... oh, sorry... coming to it with big idealist visions of becoming the new leader that will create a better world.
they enjoy the goal, but not the process!
right.
but the reality of it is that the true work of improving things is in the little achievements of the day.
and that's what you need to enjoy, just take my field.
what, what do you mean, exactly?
well, for example, I was working for this organization that helped villages in Mexico.
and their concerns was how to get the pencils sent to the kid in these little country schools.
I was not about big revolutionary ideas, it was about pencils!
I see the people that do the real work and what's really said, in a way, is that...
the people that are the most giving, hard working and capable of making this world better, usually don't have the ego and ambition to be a leader.
they don't see the interest in superficial rewards, they don't care if their name ever appear in the press, they actually enjoy the process of helping others, they're in the moment!
Yeah, but that's so hard!
you know, to be in the moment, and I just feel like I'm...
designed to be slightly dissatisfied with everything...
you know, I mean, like... always trying to better my situation.
you know, I satisfy one desire, and it just...
agitates another, you know?
then I think: to hell with everything, right?
I mean, desire is the fuel of life
I mean, do you think it's true that if...
if we never wanted anything, we'd never be unhappy?
I don't know...
not wanting anything, isn't that...
a symptom of depression?
Yeah, that is, right?
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?
yeah...
I don't know,
I mean, it's what all those Buddhist guys say, right?
you know, liberate yourself from desire and you'll find that you already have everything you need.
Yeah, but I feel really alive when I want something more than just basic survival needs.
I mean, wanting whether it's... intimacy with another person, or a new pair of shoes, is kind of beautiful...
I like that we have those ever-renewing desires.
well, maybe it's just a sense of entitlement.
you know, like whenever you feel like you deserve that new pair of shoes, you know.
it's ok to want things as long as you don't get pissed off if you don't get them.
Yeah. - Right, life's hard.
it's suppose to be.
if we didn't suffer, we wouldn't learn a thing, you know?
so, what? Are you a Buddhist or something?
no.
no? Why not?
I don't know, I...
same reason I don't consider myself anything, really.
Yeah, I know. I decided a long time ago that
I was gonna to be open to everything, but, not buy into any one-and-only belief system.
I went to this...
trapist monastery, a couple of years ago.
Trapist?
Yeah, they're Catholics, Cistercians.
why did you do that?
Why? I had just been doing some reading, I guess...
I don't know, I thought it'd be cool.
have you ever spent any time with any monks and nuns?
no...
it's not really my style.
I expected them to be all glowering and stern, but they weren't...
they were really quick to laugh, really easy to be around.
seriously, very attuned to everything.
they were just...
you know, they weren't trying to hustle anybody.
they're trying to live and die, in peace with God, you know, or whatever part of them they feel is eternal.
it was just so refreshing to be around.
you know, you realize that most of the people that you meet are trying to get somewhere better, you know, they're trying to make a little bit more cash, trying to get a little more respect, have more people admire them, you know,
it's just exhausting!
you know, it's exhausting to be one of those people yourself.
I mean, there I... there I am, right, you know, all greedy to be more spiritual, you know, I wanna be a better person.
you can't escape!
I had this...
this boyfriend of mine, many years ago, that wanted to be a Buddhist, and...
so he went to Asia to visit some of this monasteries.
Yeah, I thought about doing that, too.
Yeah, you should. I'll tell you why.
aaa, he was quite good looking, and, each time he went to one of those monasteries, a monk offered to suck his cock.
true story...
well, then, it all comes down to that, doesn't it?
I mean, I think that's why I really admire what you're doing.
what do you mean, sucking cock?
Ah, no...
I was gonna say...
you know, you're not detached... from life.
you know, you're putting your passion into action.
well...
I try.
you know something,
I'm...
I'm gonna be on planes, and like, an airport for the next 8 hours.
I'd just love to...
to see a little bit more of Paris.
could we walk, right... - Yeah, yeah, let's do that!
do you mind? - No, no, no, that's great!
do you want to? - Yeah, yeah, that's great!
what do we owe here?
4, 50...
no, no, I got it, I got it.
is this good for like a two?
Yeah, that's fine! That's more.
all right, is anywhere to go around here?
it's sales day, today!
what's that?
it's when everything is on sale in Paris.
it's twice a year.
au revoir!
au revoir, merci!
all right, let's go shopping!
no, no, no, that's a bad idea. I don't want to inflict that on you.
it's madness...
let's just go to this garden path.
all right.
it's really nice...
all right, that sounds better than shopping, actually...
I mean, not that I wouldn't do whatever you wanted.
you know, sometimes I don't even need to buy anything. I just...
get high on trying on and looking at things.
Yeah, well a therapist would tell you... Is this where we're going?
Yeah! - A therapist would tell you it's all good.
Really? - Yeah.
are you ever in therapy? - Oh, no!
do I seem like I'm in therapy?
I'm kidding...
has it helped your sex problems?
my sex problems?
no, I'm kidding... - Like what? Tell me the truth.
we didn't have any problems that night.
no, I'm kidding!
we didn't even have sex, anyway.
but, that's a joke, right?
no, we didn't!
I mean, that was the whole thing.
no, of course we did!
no, no, no, we didn't.
you didn't have a condom, and I never have sex without one.
especially on a one night thing.
I mean, I'm extremely paranoid about my health.
there's no way I would have... - Whoa, I find this very scary that you don't remember what happened.
no, listen, ok...
I didn't write an entire book, but I kept a journal, ok?
and I wrote the whole night in it.
that's what I mean, you idealizing the night!
all right, listen!
I even remember what brand of condom we used.
okay, that's disgusting. I don't want to hear it!
it's not disgusting...
OK, you know what, when I get home,
I'll check my journal from '94, but I know I'm right!
wait a minute... - What?
was it in a cemetery?
no...
no, we went to the cemetery in the afternoon, it was in a park.
very late at night.
in the park!
wait a minute...
okay...
is it that forgettable?
I mean, you really don't remember... in the park!
okay, wait a minute.
I...
I think you might be right...
all right now, you're messing with me, now.
are you messing with me?
OK, no, I'm sorry!
I think you... I mean, you're right, okay?
sometimes, I put things in drawers inside my head, and forget about it.
I guess it's less painful to put certain things away than to live with it!
I'm sorry! - It's like that...
... that night was a sad memory for you?
no, I didn't mean that night in particular...
I just meant certain things are better off forgotten.
I remember that night better than I do entire years.
me too.
Really?
well, I thought I did...
but, maybe I...
maybe I put it away because of the fact that...
my grandmother's funeral was the day we were supposed to meet again.
it was a tough day for me, but must have been worse for you.
it was unreal.
I remember looking at a dead body in the coffin.
her beautiful hands so warm, so sweet, that used to hold me, that...
nothing in that coffin resembled what I remembered of her.
all the warmth was gone.
then I was crying...
so confused if I was crying because I was never gonna see her again,
I'd never gonna see...
... you again.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to go on like this,
I've been a little down this week, I don't know...
Why?
I don't know, nothing bad, just...
reading your book, maybe?
no, but...
thinking about how hopeful I was that summer and fall, and since then it's been kind of a...
I don't know.
memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to...
deal with the past.
memory is a wonderful thing, if you don't have to deal with the past.
can I put that on a bumper stick?
no, you know what? If you wrote a book about our life, that would be a good title!
Yeah, it could be a totally different book.
Yeah, there'd be no sex nights.
but you know what?
what?
now that we've met again, we can change our memory of that December 16th.
it no longer has that sad ending of us never seeing each other again.
right? - Right.
I guess a memory is never finished.
so long as you're alive...
Yeah, I know.
I have this memory from my childhood, that, I realized recently, never happened!
what?
well, when I was 8 or 9, my mom was so paranoid when I was walking home, from my piano lesson at night, she would always warn me about dirty old men, giving me candy, and then showing me their penis...
she was so obsessed with it, that...
later in life, you know, I had...
I had this image in my head that that's really happened!
to the point that I even associated sex with that walk home.
I mean, sometimes, even now, when I'm...
when I'm having sex, I see myself walking down that street.
I swear!
it's so weird, right?
well, is that street near by?
I mean, could...
no...
very far.
did you ever keep a journal when you were a kid?
uhm, yeah...
on and off, I guess.
it's funny, I read a...
one of mine from '83, the other day.
yeah
and, what really surprised me, was that
I was feeling with life, the same way am now.
I was much hopeful and naive, but the core, and the way I was feeling things, is exactly the same!
it made me realize I haven't changed much at all.
Yeah, I don't think anybody does, and people don't want to admit it, but it's like we just...
we have this innate set points.
Aha. - You know, it's like...
nothing much that happens to us changes our disposition.
really, you believe that?
I think so. I read this study where they followed people who won the lottery, and people who had become paraplegic, right.
you'd think that...
you know, one extreme is gonna make you...
euphoric, and the other suicidal.
but the study shows that after about 6 months, - Uhum - Right...
as soon as people got used to their new situation, they were more or less the same.
the same? - Well, yeah...
like if they were basically an optimistic, jovial person, they're now an optimistic, jovial person, in a wheel chair.
if they're a petty miserable asshole, ok, they're a petty miserable asshole with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.
so, you now be forever depressed, no matter what great things happen in my life?
Definitely!
great! - No, come on...
are you depressed now?
no, no, I'm not depressed.
but, sometimes I worry that,
I'll get to the end of my life feeling I haven't done all I've all I wanted to do.
Oh, what do you wanna do?
Oh, I want to paint more, I wanna...
play my guitar everyday,
I wanna learn Chinese,
I wanna write more songs...
there're so many things I wanna do, and end up doing not much.
all right, well, let me ask you this:
do you believe in, like...
ghosts or spirits?
uhm, no.
no? - No.
OK, what about reincarnation?
not at all.
God?
no.
that sounds terrible.
no, no, no.
but, at the same time,
I don't wanna be one of those people that don't believe in any kind of magic.
so, then astrology.
Yes, of course! - There we go!
I mean, that makes sense, right?
you're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag, so we get along.
no, no.
there's an Einstein quote I really, really like.
he said: "If you don't believe in any kind of magic, or mystery, basically, as good as dead."
Yeah, I like that.
I've always felt there was some kind of mystical chord in the Universe.
more recently, I started to think that...
that me... you know, my personality, whatever, that...
I don't have any permanent place here.
you know, in Eternity, or whatever, you know.
and the more I think that, I can't go through life saying that this is no big deal, you know.
I mean, this is it!
this is actually happening.
what do you... think is interesting, what do you think is funny, what do you think is important?
you know, every day is our last!
when I feel that way, I...
usually call my mom to tell her how much I love her.
Yeah.
and she's always: "Are you ok?"
do you have cancer?
are you going to commit suicide?
it's almost not worth it.
so...
so, what about us?
what about us?
no, what I mean is, if we were both going to die, tonight...
what, like if the Apocalypse was coming?
no, no, that's too dramatic.
but, what if...
you know, just the two of us were going to die.
I mean, would we talk about your book, the environment or...
if today was our last day?
Yeah, what would we talk about, what would you tell me, for example?
well...
that's hard. - No, I'll do it, I'll do it.
I definitely...
would stop talking about my book.
I have to admit I would probably drop the environment.
but, I would still...
want to talk about, you know, magic and the Universe.
I'd just wanna do it from a...
what?
... a hotel room.
you know, in between sessions of us...
... wildly... fucking, until we die.
Wow!
well, why waste time with an hotel room?
why not do it right there... on the bench?
no... - Come here, come here...
OK
we're not gonna die tonight.
OK? - All right, too bad...
I'm sorry.
that was an extreme example.
I'm sorry. - Ok.
what I... My point was, you know, to truly communicate with people is very hard to do.
I know, I mean most of our... most of our day to day exchanges.
Yeah, I know, I mean...
not to bring everything back to sex
but, why not?
no, no, this example, this friend of mine, she...
she was talking about she and her boyfriend, problems at bed...
right...
... and how when, they had been dating for a year, she started telling him what he could do to please her more.
and it totally freaked him out!
Why? - Totally.
well, he felt all threatened and he thought he was a bad lover.
maybe she shouldn't have waited so long.
you know, after an year... - Well, yeah, but, men are so easily offended!
Oh, what, more than women, you think?
Oh, definitely on that subject! - You think so?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
well, maybe it's because, you know...
men are...
easier to...
you know, ... to please.
well, I don't know... - Yeah, they are, they definitely...
definitely.
anyway, this friend of mine, she was telling me that, next time she dates another man, she's gonna make a little questionnaire, about what they like and dislike, for the event...
like written down, or out loud?
Yeah, yeah, written down, mostly written down.
but it wouldn't be just...
you know, yes or no, it would be a little more complex than that.
like for example, if the question is:
are you into S and M?
the answer could be "No, but...
... a good spanking once in a while, doesn't hurt."
right? - Right. Or like:
do you like talking dirty in bed?
that kind of thing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but not just like...
any dirty talk.
just like: "What specific word would you like to hear?"
you know, like... - What, me?
well, yeah.
like, for example, like what specific word would you like to hear?
I don't know...
uhm...
what do you feel about the word "Pussy"?
I... love it.
good.
it's amazing what...
perverts we've become in the past 9 years.
I know, I know.
well, at least now we don't have to pretend that each new sexual experience is like a life altering event.
I know, by now, you know you've stuck it in so many places, it's like, about to fall off.
I mean, you know, I can't realistically expect you to have become anything but a total hole, at this point.
Yeah, thank you.
no, I'm sor...
that's true, what can you do?
what can you do...
so...
what kind of songs do you write?
I didn't know you did that. - What kind?
Yeah, sure. - I don't know, just songs.
like some are, you know, people,
uhm, relationships... one's about my cat!
sing one!
just... - No, I can't, I don't have a guitar.
come on, acapella.
no, no, no, I'm not singing a song without a guitar, you're nuts!
why not?
it's...
Oh, ok, not now.
no.
if not now, when?
you want to meet here in six months, with a guitar?
you know, I'll fly all they way over here, you may or may not make the metro...
OK, that's... that's funny.
we've got to get going back to the bookstore!
you'll miss your flight. Come on, let's go!
all right, all right. - We can walk down La Sennes.
it's a nice thing.
so, you're flying back to New York?
Yeah, yeah.
so I read in that article that you're married, with a kid.
that's great!
Yeah, he's... he's...
he's 4.
UhUm, what's his name?
Henry.
little Hen, he's so much fun.
Oh, wow, I'm sure!
and, your wife, what does she do?
she teaches elementary school.
do you have kids?
Yes, two.
Hih, shit!
what? - I left them in the car!
with the windows up, it was 6 months ago...
no, I'm kidding...
no, but... I want to have kids someday, I'm just not ready, yet.
Yeah, I'm in a good relationship, though.
Oh, yeah? That's good. - Yeah.
what's he do?
he's a photo journalist, he does war coverage.
he's away a lot, which in a way is good for me, because I'm so busy...
Yeah, but isn't it dangerous?
I mean, aren't a lot of this guys getting killed this days?
he promises me he doesn't take risks.
but I often worry, he goes in this trance when he starts to photograph some things.
what do you mean?
well, once we were in New Delhi and we pass a bum, that was lying down the sidewalk, - A bump? - A bum!
a homeless...
a bum, all right.
anyway, like, he looked like he needed help, but his first reaction was to photograph him!
he went, like, really close to his face, fixing his collar, to make it look better.
he was like totally detached from the person.
Yeah, but you can act to be like that, to be good at that job.
Yeah, I mean, I'm not...
you know, I'm not... I'm not judging him for it, you know, what he does is essential and incredible.
all I'm saying is that I could never do it.
let's get on that boat!
come on!
No! - No, come on, it will be fun!
you don't have time! We gotta go.
it's just about to take off. Look, I've got... I've got...
15 more minutes... Do you have a cell phone?
Yeah. - Look, I got that...
that driver guy's number, and I can call him, and then they...
... pick us up at where ever they stop this.
OK, I've never been on this boats, it's for tourists, it's embarrassing!
OK, all right.
uhm, c'est bon? Pouvons-nous entrer?
deux tickettes, s'il vous plait! - No, I'll get it, I'll get it.
non, non, c'est bon! - All right, all right, all right.
so, you're in love with that guy?
what guy?
the... the war photographer.
Yes! Of course.
Merci.
I'm sorry, do you... do you have that cell phone?
Oh, yeah.
all right, what do I tell him?
tell him to pick you up at "Quai Henry IV."
Oh, shit. At "Que...
Henry quatre.
Quai Henry IV ... HENRY QUATRE...
what's wrong with you?
no, do you want me to...
Henry quatre.
Henry four?
Yes!
come on, why didn't you says so?
I'm sorry!
Yes, is this Philippe?
Yeah, Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace...
Yeah,
listen, I'm...
I'm on one of those boats, right?
and we're gonna arrive at...
at...
Henry Four... four, Henry Four, you know that is?
all right, gre... And you have my bags, right?
Yeah, so will be there in... I don't know, it's the next stop.
OK, au revoir.
OK? - Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wow!
Notre Dame... check that out!
I heard this story once, about when the...
the Germans were occupying Paris and they had to retreat back, they wired Notre Dame to blow.
but they had to...
they had to leave one guy in charge of hitting the switch.
and the guy, the soldier, he...
he couldn't do it!
you know, he just sat there, knocked out by how beautiful the place was.
and then, when the allied troops came in, they found all the explosives just lying there...
and the switch unturned. And they found the same thing at...
Saicre Coeur...
Eiffel Tower...
a couple of other places, I think.
is that true?
I don't know...
I always liked that story, though.
Yeah, that's a great story.
did you have to think that Notre Dame will be gone one day...
there used to be another church or cathedral, at the same...
right there.
what, right in the same spot? - Yeah.
Yeah, this is great, I've never done this!
I forget about how beautiful Paris was.
it's not so bad being a tourist, you know.
thank you for getting me on the boat.
well, you're welcome.
you know, I think that book that I wrote, in a way, was like building something.
so that I wouldn't forget the details of the time that we spent together.
you know, like just a reminder that...
that once we really did meet, you know, that this was real, this happened.
and, how can you say that? Because...
I mean, I always feel like a freak because I'm never able to move on like...
...this! You know.
people just have an affaire, or even... entire relationships...
they break up and they forget!
they move on like they would have changed a brand of Cereals!
I feel I was never able to forget anyone I've been with.
because each person have...
you know, specific qualities.
you can never replace anyone.
what is lost is lost.
each relationship, when it ends, really damages me.
I haven't fully recovered.
that's why I'm very careful with getting involved, because...
it hurts too much!
even getting laid!
I actually don't do that...
I will miss of the person the most mundane things.
like I'm obsessed with little things.
maybe I'm crazy, but...
when I was a little girl, my mom told me that I was always late to school.
one day she followed me to see why...
I was looking at chestnuts falling from the trees, rolling on the sidewalk, or...
ants, crossing the road...
the way a leaf casts a shadow on a tree trunk...
little things.
I think it's the same with people.
I see in them little details, so specific to each other, that move me, and that I miss, and...
will always miss.
you can never replace anyone, because everyone is made of such beautiful specific details.
like I remember the way...
your beard has a little bit of red in it.
and how the sun was making it glow that...
that morning, right before you left.
I remember that, and...
I missed it!
I'm really crazy, right?
all right, now I know for sure.
you wanna know why I wrote that stupid book?
Why?
so that you might come to a reading in Paris, and I go walk up to you and ask:
where the fuck were you?
no, you think I'd be here today?
I'm serious, I think I...
I wrote it, in a way, to try to find you.
OK, that's...
I know that's not true, but that's sweet of you to say it.
I think it is true.
what do you think the chances were of us ever meeting again?
after that December, I'd say almost zero.
if we're not real, anyway, right?
we're just...
characters in that old lady's dream.
she's on her death bed, fantasizing about her youth...
so, of course we have to meet again!
Oh, God!
why weren't you there in Vienna?
I told you why!
well, I know why, I just...
I wish you would've been!
our lives might have been so much different!
you think so?
I actually do...
maybe not, maybe we would have hated each other, eventually.
Oh, what, like we hate each other now?
no, maybe we're...
we're only good at...
brief encounters, walking around in European cities, in one climate!
Oh, God, why didn't we exchange phone numbers and stuff?
why didn't we do that?
because we were young and stupid?
you think we still are?
I guess when you're young... you just believe...
there'll be many people with whom you'll connect with.
later in life you only realize it only happens a few times.
Yeah, you can screw it up!
you know, misconnect...
well, the past is the past. It was meant to be that way.
Yeah, you really believe that?
that everything is faded?
well, you know, the world might be less free than you think.
yeah?
Yeah, when given this exact circumstances, that's that will happen every time.
two part hydrogen, one part oxygen, you'll get water every time.
no, no...
I mean, what if your grandmother had lived a week longer, you know?
or passed away a week earlier, days even, you know.
things might have been different, I believe that!
no, you can't think like that. - I mean...
I know you shouldn't on most things, but...
it's just...
on this one, it seemed like something was off!
you know, I mean...
in the months leading up to my wedding, ok,
I was thinking about you, all the time.
I mean, even on my way there... I'm in the car, and a buddy of mine is driving me downtown, and I'm staring at the window...
and I think I see you.
not far from the church, right.
folding up an umbrella, and walking into a deli, on the corner of...
13th and Broadway.
and I thought I was going crazy, you know?
but now I think it probably was you...
I lived on 11th and Broadway.
you see.
so, what is it like to be married. You haven't talked much about that.
I haven't?
how weird?!
I don't know, me met...
you know, when I was in college...
and...
we broke up and got back together, for a period of years, and then...
what?...
we were sort of back together, and...
she was pregnant...
so, marriage.
maybe she lied.
she's a great teacher, a good mom...
uhm, she's smart...
pretty...
I remember thinking at the time, that...
so many of the men that I admire most, you know, that their lives were...
were dedicated to something greater than themselves...
so, you got married because men you admire were married?
no, no, no, it...
it's more like I have this...
this idea of my best self!
you know?
and I wanted to pursue that...
even if might have been overwriting my honor other self!
you know what I'm saying?
I mean, it's funny like...
in the moment, I remember thinking that it didn't much matter the "Who?" of it all...
I mean, that nobody is gonna be everything to...
and that ultimately, it's just a simple action of committing yourself, you know, meeting your responsibilities that...
that matters.
I mean, what is love?
right, if it's not respect, trust, admiration? And I...
I felt all those things!
so, cut to the present tense, I feel like I'm running a small nursery with somebody I...
used to date.
I mean,
I'm like a monk, you know.
I mean, I've had sex less than...
... 10 times in the last 4 years.
what?
what, what?
are you laughing at me?
no.
it sounds pathetic?
what monastery you know where monks have sex 10 times?
OK, I'm doing better than most monks. All right?
but I do, I feel like if somebody were to touch me, you know,
I would dissolve into molecules.
well, we're here. We've gotta go.
come on.
bon soir! - Bon soir!
I'm sorry, uhm...
to hear that...
you know, that... - What?
you're not that happy with your marriage.
well, this friend of mine, she's a shrink, and...
yeah? How's she doing?
she's a mess, but...
no, she was telling me that she's been dealing with a lot of couples that are breaking up for the same exact reason.
UhUm, what reason is that?
well, all this couples expected after a few years of living together for the passion, that consuming desire, to be the same as in the beginning.
it's impossible! - No, I know, I know that...
I mean, God, otherwise we would end up with aneurism if we were in that constant state of excitement, right?
we would end up doing nothing at all with our lives.
do you think you would you would have finished your book, if...
if you were fucking somebody every 5 minutes?
I might have welcomed the challenge...
but, you know, it's not true, for your wife, after the birth of your son...
she has to give all her love to the little one!
imagine that she was totally obsessed with sex, right?
and you like walk out...
that wouldn't make any sense, right?
everything you say makes sense!
it's... it's not about sex. I...
no, I know, it's...
obvious.
I...
you know, couples are so confused lately.
I think it must be that...
men... need to feel essential, and they don't anymore.
because it's been imprinted in their heads, for so many years, that they had to be the provider...
like, I...
I'm a strong independent woman in my professional life.
I don't need a man to feed me, but I still need a man to love me, and that I could love, you know.
so...
your driver's here.
well, I guess this is goodbye, and...
you'd better give me your... - No, no...
why don't we just give you a ride home, wherever you're going.
well, I can take the Metro...
no, no, no.
my flight it's not until 10, right?
I think I'm arriving two hours early. This way we can keep talking.
Monsieur...
ca vous arrive me deposer au passaje Dix Rue et Curie?
Oui, oui.
Allons-y!
no, no, ce n'est pas de probleme!
vous pouvez me laissez au metro... au metro Chateau d'Eau.
merci!
you told him where you are and all that?
Oui, oui, yeah.
so, he knows where he's going? - Yes.
let's hope he does.
now, this is better than Metro, right?
Definitely!
I was thinking...
for me it's better I don't romanticize things as much anymore.
I was suffering so much all the time.
I still have lots of dreams, but they're not in regard to my love life.
it doesn't make me sad, it's just the way it is.
is that why you're in a relationship with somebody who's...
never around?
Yes, obviously, I can't deal with the day to day life of a relationship.
Yeah, we have, you know, this exciting time together and then he leaves and I miss him, but at least I'm not dying inside.
when someone is always around me, I'm like suffocating!
no, wait, you just said that you need to love and be loved...
Yeah, but when I do, it quickly makes me nauseous!
it's a disaster...
I mean, I'm really happy only when I'm on my own.
even being alone...
it's better than...
sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely.
it's not so easy for me to be a romantic.
you start off that way, and, after you've been screwed over a few times...
you... you forget about all your delusional ideas, and you just take what comes into your life.
that's not even true, I haven't been...
screwed over, I've just had too many...
bla relationship. They weren't mean, they cared for me, but...
they were no real... connection, or excitement.
at least, not from my side.
God, I'm sorry, is it...
is it really that bad?
it's not, right?
you know...
it's not even that, I was...
I was fine.
until I read your fucking book!
it stirred shit out from you, how I had so much hope in things and...
now it's like...
I don't believe in anything that relates to love,
I don't feel things for people anymore.
in a way...
I put all my romanticism into that one night and I was never able to feel all this again.
like...
somehow this night took things away from me and...
I expressed them to you and you took them with you!
it made me feel cold, like if love wasn't for me!
I... I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.
you know what?
reality and love are almost contradictory for me.
it's funny...
every single of my ex-es...
they're now married!
man go out with me, we break up, and then they get married!
and later they call me to thank me for teaching them what love is, and...
that I taught them to care and respect women!
I think I'm one of those guys.
you know, I want to kill them!
why didn't they ask me to marry them?
I would have said "No," but at least they could have asked!!!
but it's my fault, I know that it's my fault, because...
I never felt it was the right man.
Never!
but what does it mean the right man? The love of your life?
the concept is absurd, the idea that we can only be complete with another person is...
evil!
right?
can I talk?
you know, I guess I've been heart broken too many times.
and then I recovered.
so now, you know, form the starts, I make no effort.
because I know exactly what hap... - You can't do that.
you can't do that, you can't live your life trying to avoid pain, at the expense of en...
OK, you know what? Loose our words!
I've gotta... I've gotta get away from you...
stop the car, I want to get out!
no, no, no, don't... don't get out...
you know, it's being around you... - Keep talking...
don't touch me!
you know, I wanna get on a cab... - Monsieur...
Monsieur, aretes vous!
no, no, no, don't, keep going...
no, listen, I'm just so happy... thank you, just keep going...
all right.
look, I'm just so happy, all right...
to be with you.
no, I didn't...
and it pisses me off, ok?
you come here to Paris, all romantic, and married.
OK?
screw you!
don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to get you, or anything.
I mean, all I need is married man!
there's been so much water under the bridge, it's...
it's not even about you anymore, it's about that time, that moment in time, that is forever gone, I don't know!
you... you say all that, but you didn't even remember having sex.
so...
of course I remember it...
you did?
Yes!
women pretend things like that.
they do?
Yeah, what was I supposed to say? That I remember the wine in the park, and...
us looking about the stars fading away as the sun came up!
we had sex twice, you idiot!
all right, you know what?
I'm just...
happy to see you, even if... you've become an angry, maniac depressive activist.
I still like you, I still enjoy being around you!
and I feel the same.
I'm... I'm sorry, I don't know what happened.
I just...
I had to let it all out. I... - Don't worry about it.
I'm so miserable in my love life, in my relationship, I always act as...
like...
you know, I'm detached, but I'm...
I'm dying inside.
I'm dying because I'm so numb,
I don't feel pain, or excitement...
I'm not even bitter, I'm just...
you think you're the one dying inside.
my life, is twenty-for-seven...
mad.
I'm sorry... - No, no, no...
I mean, the only happiness I get is when I'm out with my son.
I've been to marriage counseling,
I've done things I never thought I would have to do,
I lit candles, bought self-help books, lingerie...
did the candles help?
hell, no!
all right, I'm in love with the way she needs to be loved, and...
I don't even see a future for us.
but then I look at... at my little boy, sitting at the table across from me, and I think I would have suffered any torture to be with him for all the minutes of his life.
you know, I don't wanna miss out on one.
but then, then... there's no joy, or laughter, in my home.
you know, and I don't want him growing up in that!
Oh, no laughter?
that's terrible, my parents have been together for 35 years and even when they have a bad fight, they end up laughing like crazy...
I just... I don't wanna be one of those people who are...
getting divorced at 52, and falling down into tears, admitting that they never really loved their spouse, and they feel that their life has been...
sucked up into a vacuum cleaner!
you know, I want a great life.
I want her to have a great life.
she deserves that!
all right. But we're just living in a pretense of a marriage responsibility, and all this...
just...
then I...
I have this dreams...
what dreams?
I have this dreams, you know, that...
I'm standing on a platform, and...
you keep going by on a train, and...
you go by, and you go by, and you go by, and I wake up with the fucking sweats, you know?
and then I have this other dream, oh... where you're...
pregnant, in bed, beside me, naked, and I want so badly to touch you, but you tell me not to, and then you look away.
and...
and I... I...
I touch you anyway, right on your ankle, and your skin is so soft, and I wake up in sobs, all right?
and my wife is sitting there, looking at me, and I feel like I'm a million miles from her and I know that there's something...
... wrong!
you know, that I ca...
that I can't keep living like this, that there's gotta be something more to love than commitment...
but then I think that...
I might have given up...
on the whole idea of romantic love.
that I...
I might have put it to bed, that...
that day when you weren't there.
you know, I think I might have done that.
why are you telling me all this?
I'm sorry.
I don't know, I'm... I... I should... I...
I shouldn't have.
you know, it's so weird...
people think they are the only one going through tough times.
I mean, when I read the article, I thought...
your life was perfect.
a wife, a kid, a published author!
your personal life was more of a mess than mine...!
I'm sorry!
well... I'm glad it's...
good for something.
Oh, monsieur, c'est la!
Rentre dans la place la.
this is... this is... this is where you live?
Yeah.
so, you're just relieved that I'm in even more deep shit than you are?
Yes.
you've made me feel better.
Oh, good, I'm glad...
no, I really wish you the best.
it's not because I'm incapable of having a good relationship or a family that I wish everyone to be doing like me.
I'm sure you may be a great mom someday!
really, you think so?
Oh, yeah. A few anti-depressants... you know, you'll do great!
OK, say "Stop"!
uhm, "Stop"!
Heey!
you're ready?
so...
I will try something.
what?
wanna see if you stay together or if you dissolve into molecules...
how am I doing?
still here.
good, I like being here.
is this your apartment?
Oh, no, I live down there.
down there? - Yeah.
uhm, monsieur...
I'm gonna walk her to her door.
il va m'accompanier... a la porte.
this is incredible!
this is where you live?
Yeah.
how long have you been here?
four years.
so tell me...
what?
is it all true, about your dreams, or...
you just say that to hopefully get in my pants?
Oh, I just said that to get into your pants!
I use that all the time... - Oh, ok.
does it work?
eh, you know... sometimes.
here is my Che!
Oh, so cute...! Look at her.
you know what I love about this cat? It's that...
every morning I bring him down to the courtyard...
and every single morning...
he looks at everything like it was the first time!
every corner, every tree, every plant...
he smells everything with his little cute nose...
uh, I love my kitty!
I love my kitty!
what's his name?
che.
Che?
Aham.
what?
commie!
no, "Che" in Argentina means "Hey"!
Oh, baby!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
we're having a little party.
it's so much fun!
qu'est-ce que vous avez fait bon pour ce soir?
un tabule!
je vais descende in cinq minutes!
Salut!
uhm...
Salut!
so...
c'est qui celui la? Il est minion!
il mange avec nous? - Non, il prend l'avion.
Pour-quo'il ne mange pas avec nous?
il n'aime pas ton short!
mais qu'es-ce qu'il a mon short?
you know what I've...
I was thinking, uhm...
would you play me one of your songs?
you're gonna miss your flight! - I won't, I won't!
I will be sitting in the airport for over an hour, reading the newspaper.
wishing you played me one of your songs.
one song? - Yeah.
OK, but quickly.
OK.
God, I love this old staircases.
hold this!
hey there, buddy!
che...
would you like some tea?
Yeah, sure.
is chamomile ok?
Yeah.
great.
merci!
messy?
you think my apartment is messy?
no, no, no. Merci, merci... merci beaucoup.
Ah, "merci."
I meant to tell you... Your French has improved a lot.
Really? - Yeah!
Yeah, you've really mastered the language...
all right, all right.
what song are you gonna play me, huh?
now, I...
I can't. It's too embarrassing. It's been...
Wow!
no way, no way!
I came all the way up here, you cannot crap out of me now.
one song, anything will be great.
no, but listen, you're gonna laugh at me...
you think so? - Yes!
I doubt it.
OK.
what do you want to hear?
I have a...
I have 3 songs in English.
one's about my cat, one's about...
my ex-boyfriend, well, ex-ex-boyfriend, ...tuoba eno s'ereht dna well, it's just a...
little waltz.
a waltz? Yeah.
put the waltz.
I haven't played it in a while, you sure?
all right, the waltz.
let me sing you, a waltz.
out of nowhere, out of my thoughts.
let me sing you, a waltz.
about this one night stand.
you were for me that night, everything I always dreamt of in life.
but now you're gone.
you are far gone.
all the way to your island of rain.
it was for you just a one night thing.
but you were much more to me, just so you know.
I don't care what they say
I know what you meant for me that day.
I just wanted another try.
I just wanted another night.
even if it doesn't seem quite right.
you meant for me much more than anyone
I've met before.
one single night with you, little...
Jesse...
is worth a thousand with any-body.
I have no bitterness, my sweet.
I'll never forget this one night thing.
even tomorrow in other arms.
my heart will stay yours until I die.
let me sing you a waltz.
out of nowhere, out of my blues.
let me sing you a waltz.
about this lovely one night stand.
No! One more, one more.
please, please. - No! No, no, it was our deal.
one... one song!
no, no, no.
you can have your tea, and then...
all right, let me... Let me ask you one question.
do you just... plug that name in for every guy that comes up here?
Oh, yes, of course!
what do you think, that I wrote this song about you?
are you nuts?
Oh, is this you?
little cross-eyed Celine?
Yes.
that's funny...
is that your grandmother?
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
you want some honey?
Yeah, sure.
did you ever see Nina Simone in concert?
no, I never did...
can't believe she's gone...!
I know, it's so sad!
Thanks.
I saw her twice, in concert.
she was so great!
that's one of my favorite songs of hers.
...I know where I'm going...
...no more doubt of fear...
...Found my way... click, click, click.
she was so great!
she was so funny in concert!
she would...
she would be right in the middle of a song, and then...
you know, stop, and...
and... and walk from the piano, all the way to the edge of the stage.
like, really slowly...
and she'd start talking to someone in the audience...
Oh, yeah, baby...
Oh, yeah...
Uhum...
I love you too...
and then she'd walk back, took her time, no hurry, you know.
she had that...
big... cute ass!
she would move... whuh!
and then she would...
go back to the piano, and play some more.
and then she would...
I don't know, just...
start another song, in the middle of another, you know, like...
stop again...
like...
Oh, you...
can you move that thing?
Uhum.
wow...
you're cute!
Oh...
Oh, yeah! Uhum.
maybe...
you are...
major, do the initials C. W. ring a bell?
she wrote them on her side window, in her own blood.
whose cover got breached? Angie's, man.
she's been hit. They found her.
how the hell could that happen?
he's alive, Major.
who is?
I need you to be with Alejandro.
I need you to get close to him.
she told me she killed him. So what now, man?
you gonna go down there singleton? We didn't finish the job yet.
she didn't finish the job.
this isn't smart, JT.
well, maybe it's not, but it's something I got to do.
she died. When I find out exactly who is responsible for this, someone is going to die.
you're being suspended, Major.
I'm sorry, I did all I could.
this is way over my head.
you think this is gonna stop me? Major, promise me you will think long and hard before you do anything drastic.
JT: The security of the nation depends on the men and women who serve in the five rings of the Pentagon.
before any military action can be taken anywhere in the world, the mission must be planned and approved in the outer and most important ring, the E-Ring.
McNULTY: My whole life, the people that I cared about most have been taken away from me too damn early.
that's not gonna happen this time.
his CIA girlfriend's dead.
the guy that did it is bunkered down there in Colombia, and my boy is down there singing a capella with no firepower, no funding, and no friends.
now, I knew I couldn't stop him going down there singleton, but there is no reason that we can't give him backstop now.
we're right there with you, sir.
but Major Tisnewski told us that the Joint Staff had nixed the mission. Nixed a new mission.
that doesn't mean I can't send you boys down there as part of a preexisting operation.
so you're gonna travel to Bogota.
you're gonna collect tech data on the narco-terrorist group, FARC, as part of Operation Plan Colombia.
excellent idea, sir.
and while you're there, you link up with the CIA case officer that's looking for Aguilar.
sir, uh... JT seemed to think that the CIA was behind the whole thing.
one bad apple doesn't make an entire agency rotten.
now, there are thousands of great operatives working for the company, and I'm told that this cat in Bogota is one of them. Hope so, sir.
well, he's got the freshest intel, so see what kind of progress he's making. And if we should just happen to run into Major Tisnewski while we're out there, it would just be plain rude not to say hello.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
excuse me.
I'm Angela Aaronson. I'm here for the job.
Carlos is a former Cali Cartel figure.
we killed them.
all of them?
Oh, my God.
you okay?
Yeah. What about Alejandro?
it's done.
that's great. No, wait, no. There's no time.
all right, let's go.
rolling a drug mule and stealing his cash, that was... that was a beautiful thing.
I mean, scopolamine on the steering wheel?
I freaking love that, man.
so, what is it, Major, what, you got, uh, you got some little rogue operation around here that you're trying to fund?
which three-letter agency are you?
I'm Danny Marco. I work over at the embassy.
second floor, behind the vault.
Ah, mm-hmm, CIA.
Yeah.
what about your dad here?
that's Lieutenant Javier Catalan.
colombian National Police; we do a lot of work together.
see, one of my spotters down at the airport picked you up after you deplaned.
I had you tailed. What do you want?
same guy you do.
lieutenant, why don't you, uh, why don't you and your boys go out back and have a smoke, huh?
for me, this is war.
now, a CIA agent is dead, and I don't give a damn who gets credit for bringing down the people responsible, I just want it done.
great. So why don't you take off these handcuffs, go grab a beer with Javy the cop, and I'll pretend like we ever met.
What'd you think, that 30 grand and a Glock . 40's gonna get you any closer to Alejandro?
wake up, amigo.
you need me. Really?
hm, see, I'm thinking you need me.
otherwise, what are you doing here?
Hey, I wasn't here for the bloodbath three years ago; you were.
so what do you say we join forces, and we get this job done right? Collaborating with the CIA isn't on the top of my list right now.
what if I told you that two of your
special Forces buddies are already on their way?
all right, let's get you out of those cuffs.
thompson: If you want to avoid an FBI manhunt,
I suggest you tell me where I can find Major Tisnewski.
well, maybe if you tell us why it's so urgent that you speak with him.
we have new evidence...
in what is now the homicide of a Federal agent.
I believe Major Tisnewski can shed some light on the matter.
and does this new evidence have anything to do with the internal investigation the CIA was running on Angela Aaronson? I can't talk about that.
Colonel, would you like to grab some lunch? You read my mind, ma'am.
hold on.
we believe a top official in the CIA may have been involved somehow in Ms. Aaronson's death. Raymond Metcalfe?
look, you want to find out who's responsible for this murder, and we want to exonerate Major Tisnewski. Exonerate him from what?
he is the subject of a Procedure 15 investigation, which is why he's not here right now. He's been suspended?
until we right this wrong, yes.
we bieve this inquiry was instigated, at least indirectly, by Metcalfe.
so why couldn't we just work together for a change, like the American people expect?
do you have a secure computer?
we found this memory key in Agent Aaronson's apartment.
as best I can tell, Ms. Aaronson was collecting information on Director Metcalfe.
major Tisnewski told me that Metcalfe had threatened Angie in the past.
my read on this is, she was trying to compile evidence that he'd abused his office.
Yeah, so she could get out from underneath the sword that was hanging over her head. According to some of these e-mails,
Metcalfe found out Ms. Aaronson was digging up dirt on him.
and he retaliated by urging the IG's office to start an investigation into her relationship with Major Tisnewski.
which led them to Cemetery Wind.
Yeah, but that still doesn't explain how the killers found her.
a lot of these files are in code.
I'm hoping they can shed some more light on what's going on.
you have anybody who can decrypt them?
we might.
watch it, this stuff's heavy.
for the record, I want you know you both punked out on me big-time. Yeah, well, we're here now.
you want to bitch about it some more, be my guest.
no, I'm done.
so what's in the bag?
what's up?
Oh, yeah, the spook.
great.
well, it's nice to meet you guys, too. Really.
there you are.
there we go. Thank you.
sexy. Ooh.
Text-compression, meta-algorithms...
ascii alphanumerics...
english, Greg.
it's a real bitch.
well, can you crack it?
is the Dalai Lama Buddhist... sir?
McNULTY: Metcalfe knew, JT.
knew what?
that Alejandro was still alive.
well, how'd you find that out?
NSA decrypted an e-mail he sent to Angie.
what did it say?
basically, "Stop trying to dig up dirt on me, or I'll go public with your mission failure.
that's why she wanted to meet me.
she was going to tell me the truth.
LISTON: We just decrypted files that indicate that
director Metcalfe knew Alejandro Aguilar wastill alive, and yet failed to report that intelligence to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.
I'm sure he had his reasons.
you're the Deputy Inspector General for the CIA, Mr. Sykes.
it is your duty to open a counterinvestigation into the crimes or misconduct that may have been committed by Raymond Metcalfe.
ms. Liston, I'm not sure I want to open...
or I could call my friends on the Hill and suggest that they open a more wide-ranging congressional inquiry into the inspector general's failures.
W do you want to play charades, or do you want to play ball?
what are the charges?
that you deliberately and illegally withheld intelligence, and that your failure to inform resulted in the death of a federal agent.
J-3, Special Operations Division.
master Sergeant Pierce speaking.
Yes, I'm trying to locate James Tisnewski.
he's out of the office at the moment.
may I be of some assistance to you?
uh, this is
Yes, sir, Mr. Aaronson. We're all so very sorry.
Yes. Thanks. Listen, um...
I'm going through my daughter's things and I...
found a few items which I assume belong to Tisnewski.
and, uh, I just want to know where to send them.
that won't be necessary. I'll pick them up.
are you going to be there all day?
Yeah.
marco: Well, it was a hell of an operation.
I mean, talk about synchronization.
in five minutes, there's three factories out of commission, 12 major bad guys dead...
should've been 13.
so how did Alejandro get away?
look, if the guy was tough to bring down last time, he's going to be an even bigger bitch now.
all right, he changed his appearance, probably his identity...
Muere, bitch!
he's been underground since your little encounter and most of his known associates are dead.
so if we're going to have any kind of success here you boys are going to have to start coming clean with the operational details.
look, man, we don't know you.
so why don't you relax a little bit on the operational details, all right?
okay.
fair enough.
at least want to tell me how you guys got inside?
I mean, the Aguilars were a pretty tight-knit family at the time.
Impetrable.
well, you see, Dan, Alejandro just loved the ladies, man.
is he watching me?
in that outfit? What do you think?
I think it's time for you to go get that drink.
I'll pay for the dress. No, no, no, no.
you do not have to pay for anything. It was an accident.
I am Alejandro.
it is nice to meet you, Angela.
if you would like to join us, we have a table over there. Thank you, but I'm with somebody.
I understand.
what the hell are you thinking?
I'm not going to hook him by being easy.
Alejandro was dating some beauty queen at the time.
maybe she's still around. Ina Perez.
died in August.
heroin overdose.
what about the fat guy who ran their club?
Brad Pitt filming a movie here?
what is the name of this movie?
that is a great title, my friend.
vamonos, let's go, huh? Come.
what was his name?
Chato Mendoza. He's still there.
let's bring him in.
Where's Alejandro, Chato?
he's dead.
they're all dead!
the Aguilars were your meal ticket.
you don't look like you've skipped too many of those, man.
come on, Chato, he bankrolls your club.
where do you send his cut?
look at this place.
I haven't turned a profit since the old days, man. All right, fellas, looks like we're going to have to employ some more sophisticated means of motivation.
that's a good idea.
I'll grab the pliers.
I went to the funeral!
I saw him buried!
he's lying. No, senor.
graduation Day. University of Miami.
my guess is they recruited her there.
pretty soon, the visits stopped, and the calls just came less and less often.
sir, people who work in intelligence can't tell their families where they go or what they do.
so oftentimes it's easier not to talk to them at all, rather than lie to them all the time.
doesn't mean she loved you any less.
are you happy here, Ms. Liston?
I beg your pardon?
the Pentagon.
this place is a behemoth.
I'm very happy here, sir. Thank you for your concern.
how would you like to be a bigger fish in a smaller pond?
you know, I really don't have time...
I'm offering you a job, Ms. Liston.
general Counsel to the Directorate of Operations at CIA. You don't even know me.
I've done my homework.
berkeley undergrad, Boalt Law...
and I know from your recent dealings with Mitchell Sykes,
I'd rather have you working for me than against me.
Mr. Metcalfe, you failed to alert the intelligence community was still alive.
ms. Liston, that's untrue...
not only did you violate public trust to serve your own interests, but it led to the death of one of your own. Now from what I hear, you're going to be indicted for gross misconduct.
so my one-time-only free legal advice to you...
is hire private counsel.
BOBBY: Back home, we'd be cutting through red tape for days to get a body exhumed.
we give these grave diggers a case of Scotch, and we're good to go.
it's a hell of a system.
well, if whoever or whatever is in that casket gives us a link to Alejandro, it'll be worth a whole truckload of Scotch.
what are the odds it's empty?
I'll give you five to one.
what's the bet?
that this Mata Hari wannabe doesn't have a prayer in hell of hooking Aguilar while he's at mass with his mama.
Bob, we're at a church. Gambling's a sin.
on second thought, put me down that-a-girl.
homeboy's having his own religious experience right there.
that's a hundred dollars U. S.
I treated it like it was a game.
we do what it takes to keep ourselves sane, brother.
you did what you had to.
so did she.
so much for dental records.
we could still get some prints, find out who this poor bastard was.
Charlie: Prints on the stiff belong to a Chilean national, Federico Peron.
low-level drug courier.
disappeared from Santiago about four years ago.
just around the time we took out the Aguilars. That's a nice coincidence.
so Alejandro has the guy buried in his place, assumes his identity.
does that ring a bell to you, Dan? No.
run his prints through the national system, request a J-2 analysis and liaison with the FBI database.
maybe this Peron had contact with Aguilar.
maybe that'll help us find him.
got it, boss.
come in.
excuse me, Ms. Liston?
master Sergeant Pierce, come on in.
what can I do for you?
it's about Angela Aaronson's father, ma'am.
I can't imagine.
he just found out what his daughter did for a living and I'd like to give him some closure.
tell him everything I can about his daughter's life without breaking any laws.
well, I'd be happy to explain the legal limits of what you can and can't say.
but are you sure you want to get involved personally with this?
normally, I wouldn't be so forward.
but...
I understand what it's like to have questions when somebody dies. Your husband?
Yes, ma'am.
um, when he was killed, I had this need to know every detail.
but all I got was this letter in the mail saying "We regret to inform you that "your husband was killed by an improvised explosive device.
had a feeling in my bones there was more to it than that.
what did you find out?
that he was scheduled for an R&R in Qatar that weekend.
but he gave up his leave when a bunch of men in his unit fell sick with the flu.
I'm sorry.
I was so mad I couldn't see straight.
at the end of the day, do you think you might've been better off not knowing?
it's not a question of better off, ma'am, it's a question of moving on.
Yes, Mr. Sykes. What have you got for me?
Yeah.
yeah"?
who in the hell taught you phone etiquette, Captain,
sorry, sir.
well, let me talk to him.
how you doing, sir?
ms. Liston just got a juicy tidbit from Sykes at the CIA.
I'm all ears, Colonel.
apparently, just after they requisitioned
cemetery Wind files,
Metcalfe started exchanging an unusual number of phone calls and e-mails with one of his case officers down there.
who?
the agent's name
I got three words for you, kid: Watch your ass.
wake up.
now, Dan...
if we're going to be successful, you're going to have to give me all of your operational details.
JT, you know I can't get into classified... One agent is dead already, Dan.
you want to make it two?
look, man, we're on the same side.
then tell me what you know.
for the past year I've been running a counter-narcotics op with Catalan and his CNP boys, okay?
a new big fish just emerged.
he's got lots of cash, lots of supply, lots of guns.
this fish have a name?
at least, that's what we thought.
the headless horseman.
Yeah.
except that I didn't know that I was chasing a ghost.
then the inspector general's office sends out a bunch of suits, starts showing pictures and asking questions about a three-year-old operation.
cemetery Wind. So I start looking at the work that you guys did, and I suddenly realize
federico is Alejandro, all right?
he's now back from the dead.
so you lied when you said you never heard of Peron.
come on, JT, you know how this works, all right?
my bosses told me to hold my cards close. That's what I did.
you knew for the last few weeks that Alejandro was on the loose, and you never told a soul.
no, I told my Chief of Station.
and then next thing I know,
I'm on a conference call and I'm briefing Metcalfe himself.
And?
And?!
and Metcalfe said that if we told the Inspector General that Federico was Alejandro, that he'd probably get involved and ruin my entire operation.
that's a year's worth of work gone.
Metcalfe ordered us to continue with the action while he dealt with the I. G.
in the meantime, Alejandro flies to DC and he puts four slugs into Angie.
I don't know how that happened, all right?
we had him under surveillance.
we even moved up the timetable of the action so we could take him down sooner.
but when we moved in, he was gone.
are you telling me that someone tipped him off about the takedown?
Angie's identity?
how else do you explain it?
I don't know, Dan.
Metcalfe wanted Agent Aaronson out.
maybe he promised you a big promotion if you let Alejandro know where she was.
come on, JT, I didn't have to tell you any of this, man.
I just gave you all of my actionable intel.
BOBBY: Sure she's gotten us some intelligence, but can she close the deal?
listen to me, she knows what she's doing, all right?
she's one of us.
look, man, I'm not going to blame you for falling for her... I'm not falling for her.
she is CIA, all right?
she is definitely not one of us.
marco: You're just going to have to trust me on this.
I don't, and I won't.
I'll see you in hell.
come on, man! What, are you crazy?!
Yeah, a little bit.
all right, okay, okay, okay!
all right, fine.
I'll share all my tech data with you.
I'll give you names, I'll give you places,
I'll give you dates.
you can decide for yourself if I'm on the up and up, okay?
okay?
okay.
PIERCE: What's this?
agent Aaronson's file.
every breath she took while she worked for the Company.
now I don't have to tell you it doesn't leave this office.
you're cleared to look through it.
when you're done, we can talk about how and what you're free to share with Mr. Aaronson.
thank you.
this is a hell of an operation.
Federico/Alejandro had going.
a thousand kilos a month?
that was the big mystery.
how's this Chilean guy show up from out of nowhere with these kind of management skills?
the big mystery now is who's the rat who tipped him off and got our girl killed.
who are you?
what are you doing with my brother?
what Alejandro and I do is none of your damn business.
none of my damn business?
none of my damn business...
he's my brother.
and I will do everything and anything to protect him.
look at me.
let's take a ride.
Why?
because my brother...
is weak.
he sees a beautiful woman...
maybe she's not what she says she is.
what the hell? First the pretty boy and now this guy?
Hey, go home, my friend.
I'm not going anywhere.
you going to disrespect me like that?
don't... Hey!
major, it's Greg. I have that info.
it's that NSA dude-- Greg.
put him on speaker.
what have you got for us, Greg?
right before this Peron guy was reported missing in Santiago, he bought a plane ticket.
let me guess-- Bogota.
bingo, Major.
hope he didn't buy a round-trip ticket.
well, the interesting thing is that the amount of the ticket corresponds exactly to a voucher submitted to the Intelligence Contingency Fund by a CIA case officer two days earlier.
can you get me that ICF citation number?
sent.
hand me that ledger.
Yeah, thought so.
the account belonged to my predecessor.
he gave the cash over to one of his HUMINT sources.
any idea who it is?
let's find out.
Oh, you son of a bitch.
code name Snow Cone. Who's that?
marco: My boy Javier Catalan.
I've been running this guy for a year.
he's been a real asset.
sounds like he's been running you.
he always seemed legit.
he got the money for Peron to fly to Bogota, buried him in
Alejandro's place and he knew you moved up the timetable to take him down, right?
what about Agent Aaronson?
how would Catalan have known about her?
you said the IG's office sent down a bunch of suits, showing pictures, asking questions about Cemetery Wind? Yeah.
did they interview Catalan?
anybody here got a chainsaw?
JT: As much as we all want to cut this guy to pieces, we've got to do this smart, all right?
we're going to have breach points here and here.
if he tries to go out the service entrance, we're going to have a team waiting.
we found Alejandro.
fantastic.
how? JT: NSA picked up a cell conversation he had with a contact in Caracas.
he's headed there tonight at 10: 00 p. m.
we're going to grab him at the airport.
we're going to need some of your boys for backup, all right? I'll make some calls.
you got a smoke?
we got his ESN tagged? I'm on it.
intercept it.
we got him.
talk to me, Greg.
keep your pants on, Major.
there you go.
looks like your boy's holed up on some primo real estate.
why don't you tell us, cabron?
tell me something...
what's a woman's life worth in this town, anyway?
honestly...
not that much.
I keep telling you, man...
she's been working for me for the last three years.
you know, she's a hell of a saleswoman.
she had me believing that she loved me.
what are you doing in Bogota?
cell phones.
hawk your phones somewhere else.
whoa, JT... Hey, JT, come on.
what are you doing?
she was gung-ho, Bob.
what are you doing?
I was handling it. You weren't handling it.
you were about to get in the car with that guy.
what do you say we go take a ride?
I wasn't going to get in a car with that psycho.
whatever. He suspects you now.
so we either have to move on them now, go home or die.
go home or die.
you need his cell phone data, right?
Yeah, it's the Holy Grail.
okay, I'll take care of it.
what do you mean, you're going to take care of it, Angie?
that thing's like his shadow.
how are you going to take care of it?
there's no shadows when the lights are off.
I got some bad newstoday.
they, uh, they need me on a project back in the States.
I'll go with you.
who's gonna tell your family?
Angela, I hate everything about my family.
you think I want this to be my life?
cocaine? Killing?
I love you.
and if you say the word,
I will go with you.
it's all there.
names, numbers, the whole infrastructure.
I'm gonna go take a shower.
JT: She said she could handle it.
I never would've sent her in otherwise.
you can't change the past, man.
but what you can do is set things right.
you ready?
all right, boys.
give me a visual.
I got two guards in the courtyard.
one fixed, one roaming.
marco: One more on the balcony overlooking the city.
what do you see, JT?
are you there?
do you copy?
JT: Yeah, I copy.
marco: What do you see?
a ghost.
all right, listen up.
he's in the pool.
on me.
we either have to move on them now, go home or die. Go home or die.
status.
clear.
two down, all clear.
clear.
sweep the house.
please.
I can make you rich.
tell me why she let you live.
please...
tell me.
who are you, the police?
shut up.
you're going to kill me, is that it?
blow my head off because my family is bad?
you know, you are not a murderer.
I told you I would leave and I mean it.
I said shut up!
Angela, please.
you cannot kill me.
I promise, I disappear.
nobody will know that you let me live.
I... am not like my family.
and neither are you.
get up!
she had a heart.
she couldn't even pull the trigger.
but you could.
so can I.
you okay?
it's done.
reporter: CIA Director of Operations Raymond Metcalfe was charged this morning in a sealed indictment.
though the details are classified, sources say the arrest is related to the recent shooting death of...
it's a bad day at Langley.
welcome back, kid.
dismissed.
how was your vacation?
I ended up working the whole time, sir.
Yeah, well, vacatis can be very stressful, what with the time change, security at the airport, taxi lines. Hell, you come home, you need a vacation from your vacation.
so, if you want to take a few more days, there's no problemo.
I thought I was cut loose indefinitely, sir.
your pal Sonny took care of that.
she got you reinstated.
got those spots off your record.
you're good to go.
you know, I keep thinking about what more I could've done.
the planning, the training.
some things can't be trained, son.
you can take a battle-hardened boot.
he can't always kill a man when he's looking him straight in the eye.
you gotta think of all the good things that she did, and at the end of the day, you, you just take comfort in that math, son.
thank you, sir.
all right. Dismissed.
suicide Bomber Thwarted in Tel Aviv.
terrorist Cell Member Detained at Canadian Border with Explosives.
what is this?
just trying to get you reacquainted with your daughter, sir.
angela was involved in all this?
regretfully, sir, I can't comment on matters of national security.
she was a hero.
this seat taken?
what's this?
a transcript of Angie's rainy day file on Metcalfe.
I already know Metcalfe was investigating her.
but, what you didn't know is that Metcalfe threatened to come down on you if she didn't brk it off.
she really loved you, Major.
is that what the file says?
Oh, come on, I'm a girl.
I don't need a file to tell me that.
you know what I loved about her most?
her heart.
and that's what ended up getting her killed.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
I guess now I realize why you're such a hardass.
it's how you stay alive.
who you calling a hardass, Liston?
excuse me?
I'm not the one named after a heavyweight champion.
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't have to make weight, so are you, are you gonna eat
before any military action can be taken anywhere in the world, the mission must be planned and approved in the outer and most important ring, the E-Ring
good morning, Yankee six.
this is reindeer one, over.
what's so damn good about it, reindeer one?
somebody spit in your eggnog, Yankee six?
it's Christmas.
and you're about to deliver three tons of presents to some very happy campers in charabanc.
well, hell, when you put it that way, reindeer one, ho, ho, ho.
what's your eta?
we should be skits to the stones in less than two hours.
the birds should be on the ground by 06：00 local time.
they'll link up with sergeant Gutierrez and his boys.
another couple hours to off-load the goodies, and operation be mission accomplished.
careful, kid. Remember the last time somebody used the words mission accomplished?
only time, we hope we're gonna be right, sir.
the people in chakaran helped me and my boys out when we were on the run from a nasty band of Taliban back in '01.
that's the least we can do
give 'em food, clothing and fuel.
get them through the harsh Afghani winter.
it's a good thing you're doing, sir.
these people deserve something besides war, repression, and earthquakes.
I checked the manifest.
it's a little more than humanitarian aid.
you got some pretty fancy small arms going in that shipment.
well, the Taliban is resurgent.
our friends in the region need the means to protect themselves.
which is why Charlie and his team will be down there doing a little advanced weapons training.
and speaking of protection, how about the secdef's visit to the troops in Iraq?
security's in place ready for a successful landing in Baghdad, followed by Christmas dinner with the 101st airborne.
now, what about our Christmas dinner, Pierce?
is that all set for tomorrow?
prime rib is marinating as we speak, sir.
Mmm. Yeah. - Excuse me?
I'm looking for colonel Mcnulty.
you found him.
master sergeant Meeks, sir.
captain Shea's new ops nco.
Oh, welcome to the building, Meeks. This is major Tisnewski, master sergeant Pierce.
captain Shea wanted me to deliver this to you, sir.
said it was classified and time sensitive.
well, open it up, son.
sir, I don't have clearance.
are they, uh, letting hearing impaired into the air force these days, master sergeant?
I said open it.
Yes, sir.
it's a fruitcake, sir.
I, uh... I miss something?
uh, captain Shea and colonel Mcnulty have been re-gifting the same fruitcake since, uh, Christmas '92, sir?
well, it's good to know I'm performing such important duties since that I'm in joint operations.
Oh, come on, lighten up, Meeks.
when you're dealing with life and death every day, you need a few laughs.
Colonel's right.
give it a chance.
you might learn to like it here.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will.
j-3. Special operations division.
master sergeant Pierce speaking.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Admiral Cooper is requesting you both in the NMCC.
three of our choppers just took fire 50 clicks north of Kabul.
JT: Not operation payback?
afraid so.
were there any casualties, admiral?
negative, but we had to turn the birds back. I'm sorry.
do we know who shot at them?
lead chopper pilot thinks it was Taliban.
but our latest intel indicates the nearest Taliban are well to the north.
well, it looks like our intel was wrong.
gentlemen.
Oh, Mr. Murphy.
what's public affairs doing in the command center on Christmas eve?
this little "humanitarian mission" of yours
I'm recommending to the secdef that we scrap it.
Mr. Murphy, this "little mission" is going to save 200 lives over the next six months.
well, then maybe you can try it again after the new year, major.
sir, bad weather sets in, we'll never get the supplies to those villagers.
they'll either starve or get slaughtered by the Taliban.
I'm sorry, but public support for overseas military actions is waning.
what we need are feel-good stories
like the secdef having Christmas dinner with 2, 000 troops and a dozen grateful Iraqi dignitaries.
not special ops air crews coming home in flag-draped coffins
sir, we're at war. There's nothing feel-good about it.
and if we fail to win the war with the press, we're not going to be able to help anybody...
including your Afghan villagers.
the mission is a no-go.
so much for peace on earth, good will toward men.
Akaran mission's been scrubbed.
they pulled the plug on us, Charlie.
don't let them do it, Jt.
look, man, this is way above my pay-grade.
the secdef is having dinner with the troops in Iraq, and they don't want to have any bad press about a failed human mission
JT, I've been waiting for four years to do this.
you promised me and I promised them.
I know.
I went into that village last week.
I got 'em all together, and I told them:
in gratitude for what you did for me and my buddies in '01, the people of the united states are sending you three tons of food, clothing, and weapons.
Charlie... - You remember Aarif?
Yeah, the kid who wanted to be a doctor?
Yeah. When I told him they were sending medical supplies and books, he was so happy, he cried, Jt.
he actually cried.
you lay a better guilt trip on me than my mother, you know that?
they saved our lives, boss.
you, me, Bobby...
none of us would be celebrating Christmas today if it wasn't for them.
look, I'm trying.
but humanitarian missions aren't at the top of anybody's list around here.
JT, the Taliban attacked these people before, conscripted the men they didn't kill, pulled the girls from school, and these lunatics know the villagers assisted the U. S.
they move back in, Jt, it's not going to be about humanitarian aid.
it 's going to be about preventing a massacre.
which we might be able to do if we got them the arms in that shipment.
we're going to have to get "eyes on," boss, see what they're really up against.
all right, I'll get a drone up...
get some photos of those caves, retask a satellite.
pictures from space aren't going to do us much good if the Taliban don't want to be seen.
okay, so the humanitarian mission's out that doesn't mean you and your guys can't get out there and do some tactical recon.
maybe we can get this mission back on track.
now, that's the Christmas spirit.
my momma taught me never to show up empty-handed, Pierce, I've gotta bring something to Christmas dinner.
thank you, colonel, but all I need is your company.
whatcha got this time, Meeks?
Nutcracker and mistletoe?
actually, sir, captain Shea sent me to update you on security for secdef's visit to Baghdad.
we've got a car of f-15's flying in support, along with an EA6B prowler.
you could have picked up the phone, Meeks.
would have been a lot faster.
I... uh, I enjoy the exercise, sir.
I mean, the winter in D. C. kills my jogging regimen.
Oh, you're a runner?
sound body, sound mind, sir.
just have to adjust to the cold.
D. C. Is a little icier than Houston.
Uh-huh... is that where you're from?
your family still there?
yeah-- mom, pops, three sisters.
no wife?
gotta make for a lonely Christmas.
I'll be all right, sir.
well, I should... I should get back.
sounds like someone could use an invitation to Christmas dinner.
today's not the holiday to be playing Cupid, colonel.
it's prime rib, Pierce.
it's not a date.
you know, I gotta say, it seems like you two have a lot in common.
what are you trying to say, colonel?
Pierce, I would say the same thing if the man were purple.
I'm just trying to see that you have a little fun. That's all.
Colonel who needs fun when I have you?
yeah... uh-huh.
Hey, admiral Cooper.
what can I do for you?
well, I was going to ask a favor, but I see you're ready to get out of here.
well, I'm catching a flight to San Francisco to see my family.
well, good for you, Miss Liston.
nothing like being home for the holidays.
Yeah, nothing like it.
then go...
my flight doesn't leave for a few hours.
how can I help?
I have an old Vietnam buddy in town and he's having trouble getting his service records.
we used to fly together and most of the work we did was classified.
and you want me to help him jump through the legal hoops to get this records released.
I probably should have gone to a less senior staff attorney, but this man's a decorated war hero.
and we all know how effective you can be when it comes to putting the fear of god into the bureaucrats.
are you saying people are scared of me, admiral?
what's the gentleman's name?
Colonel James Tisnewski, senior.
u. S. Marine corp, retired.
my old man's here, in the building?
he didn't tell you he was coming?
no. How did you find out?
well, admiral Cooper asked me to help him access his service records.
he's going to be in my office in ten minutes.
okay.
look, I know you two aren't close, but I thought you might want to see him.
well, he obviously didn't want to see me, right?
otherwise, he would've called.
well, maybe he's planning on calling you after he's done with me.
Samantha, look, the last time my father and I talked was when my mother served him with papers.
that was three years ago.
I know how difficult it is to have divorced parents.
are you kidding?
when he finally left, we threw a party.
I'm serious. I was in charge of the booze, my sister did the decorations, and my brother sent out the invites.
well, you might want to take the high road, major.
it is Christmas.
you know how many Christmases we spent together, Sunny?
zero.
not a one. You know why?
he always volunteered for service.
well, he's here now.
if you want to help him, Samantha, that's fine.
but I'm not gonna let him ruin my holiday.
Oh, man.
take some photos, uplink them to centcom.
CENTCOM just sent us thermal imagery from sergeant Guitterez and his recon team.
they're reporting close to a hundred Talibani fighters 12 clicks north-north-east of chakaran and closing.
looks like they're being forced down the mountains from the weather. Captain?
a storm is coming in from the north.
heavy precipitation and high winds.
meaning these fighters are probably going to continue heading south looking for shelter, either in these caves here, in grid nine...
...or the village of chakaran.
now, they're on foot, in these kind of conditions, they could get there in about six hours.
sir, centcom's asking to break in.
go ahead.
Admiral, we have a secure link established with task force reindeer in Afghanistan.
patch them through.
how's the weather, sergeant?
it's not the clouds I'm worried about, sir, it's all the uninvited guests.
well, maybe it's time for you to bug out.
sir, we peel out now, and those Taliban move back into the village, they're not going to have any way to defend themselves.
well, you're not going to take on a hundred Taliban with four soldiers, sergeant.
no, sir, but I thought we'd be in a position to laser designate air strikes.
I'm not sure anyone's going to be authorizing air strikes, sergeant.
not with the bad weather.
maybe we won't have to, sir.
captain, what are the odds of this storm changing course?
based on computer models,
I'd say there's a 30% chance it'll take a turn to the west within the next two hours.
Admiral, if the Taliban are just moving to avoid the storm, there's a strong possibility they'll change course when it does.
30% is not exactly a slam dunk, major.
all we need is a small Christmas miracle, sir.
not only would the threat to the villagers dissipate, but we could revive operation payback.
all right, sergeant, I want you to sit tight.
and we'll pray for that Christmas miracle.
settling in?
I'm trying.
it's not easy when you've been looking for "in processing"for...
...45 minutes.
didn't you spend seven years as a loadmaster for the spectre gunship squadron?
and aren't they known forgetting anywhere in the world at a moment's notice?
you been checking upon me, master sergeant?
apparently you didn't receive the pentagon NCO handbook.
rule number one-- always know who you're dealing with.
what's rule number two?
say less than you know.
does that mean you're not going to tell me the way to "in-processing" ?
if you don't mind me asking, colonel Tisnewski, you retired 15 years ago.
why are you just now looking for your service records?
I've seen a lot of interesting stuff in my day.
thought maybe some folks want to read about it.
you're writing a book?
put you down for an autographed copy.
well, colonel, surely you're aware that the pentagon does not release classified information for personal use-- especially not a book.
you know, admiral Cooper said you were a smart cookie.
can I be honest with you?
by all means.
I got a bum liver.
it's not what you think.
I'm not a boozer. I never was.
but I got a bad case of hepatitis C.
I'm sorry. Uh...
problem is, the medicine costs $40, 000 a year.
the VA's not gonna cover it unless I can prove it was service-related
and you're sure it is?
well, I received a battlefield transfusion in 1968.
it was in the jungle.
conditions weren't exactly sanitary.
and does your son know about this?
my son.
you know Jimmy?
Yes, we do a lot of work together in the special operations division.
well, my son and I aren't actually that close.
he resents me for not being around when he was a kid, and he's right.
I don't blame him.
and I'm certainly not going to bother him with my problems now.
well, he is your son.
he might want to know.
ms. Liston, could you just make those calls for me?
sorry to be scrooge, kid. but I just got some bad news from the weather.
the storm hasn't changed direction.
and neither have the Taliban.
they could be in the village in four hours.
sir, we drove the Taliban out four years ago.
it cost a lot of money and a lot of lives.
we let those fanatics get another foothold it will all be for nothing.
you got another idea?
how about if we used a C-130, flew above the bad weather, dropped the payload from a higher altitude, out of the range of the Taliban's guns?
that way, if they do try to take chakaran, the villagers can use the weapons to drive them out.
but how do we hit the target?
if we miss the mark, we end up arming and resupplying the Taliban not the villagers.
master sergeant Meeks was a loadmaster.
he's fresh from the field in Iraq.
he could tell us what toys the air force has that could help us.
you been hanging out with Meeks?
just helping him get acclimated, sir.
I don't remember getting that kind of treatment when I was new to the building.
I don't think she'd even get you coffee, would she?
with this remote guidance system, we can resupply ammo, drop ordnance or deliver targeted attacks to precise coordinates.
with laser targeting, it's 90% accurate.
the laser design a tors are standard issue for all special ops teams in Afghanistan.
then, sir, you could attach one of these remote guidance devices to your payload, drop it from 10, 000 feet, land in the bed of a pickup doing 60 on the interstate.
hmm. How's it work?
a loadmaster sends the laser-designated coordinates to the guidance unit.
it locks on through GPS.
the computer tells the motor to adjust the tether son the chute...
...and...
bingo.
air force have any of these bad boys in Afghanistan?
negative, sir.
the boys in Baghdad got an exclusive.
so how do we get the devices from Baghdad to Kabul?
we'll have to get a plane to deliver them;
you need a joint air tasking order.
well, what are you waiting for, Pierce?
24 hours minimum, just to get it up the chain of command.
ahh...
so what we need is a plane already in theater, to take these devices from Iraq to Kabul, without the bureaucracy.
and how are you supposed to do this, major? Santa Claus?
what about cowboy one?
the secretary of defense's plane?
we got a sackful of toys. All we need is a sleigh.
are you insane?
you can't use the secdef's plane on a mission.
I think you're missing the big picture, sir.
I'm the associate secretary of defense for public affairs.
I don't miss the big picture, major.
I paint it.- Then be a visionary, sir.
the secdef having dinner with the troops, that's...
that's paint-by-numbers.
now, the secdef canceling his Christmas dinner and rerouting his plane to assure the success of a humanitarian mission that will save the lives of villagers in Afghanistan who risked their own lives for American special forces back in 2001?
now, that...
that's a masterpiece.
does he ever come up for a breath?
you have to admit, sir, that's a pretty good Christmas story.
all right, let's get the secdef on the horn.
and you think the secdef will go for it?
you kidding? I could sell ice to Eskimos.
wish I could been a fly on that wall.
how long you think it's gonna take?
well, soon as cowboy one lands in Baghdad, air force will load up there mote guidance devices, refuel and make the hop to Kabul.
Roger that. I'll have the boys on the airbase on the other end standing by ready to load up supply pallets.
how long you figure it's gonna be, about five hours?
sounds about right.
so stay warm, stay alert, and-- hey.
Yeah, boss?
be good, for goodness sake.
I talked with your father, major.
let me guess.
he said you're wasting precious reproductive years working a man's job.
he was very gracious, actually.
that's because you're not family, and he probably wanted something from you.
did he tell you his war stories?
flying phantom F-4's and killing Vietcong with his bare hands?
did he ask you to pray with him?
he's sick, you know.
my old man has never seen a doctor in his life.
you serious?
three tour sin Vietnam.
people's lives catch up with them.
Hello, sir.
Hello, Jimmy.
so what brings you to the pentagon on Christmas eve?
Oh, nothing. Just having a cup of coffee, reading the newspaper.
why don't you cut the crap just for once?
you watch your step, Jimmy.
I know you sent an appeal to the veterans administration asking them for help with your medical bills for hepatitis C.
and who told you that, the blonde lawyer?
she thought I'd want to know.
well, it's none of your damn business.
look, papa, whether you like it or not, we're family.
so if you need somebody's help navigating through the bureaucratic minefields around here, you should have come to me first.
I know my way around. I can help you cut through the red tape.
does that mean you're a secretary now?
you know, sir, you can insult me all you want.
it doesn't change the fact that if you don't get this medication, you're going to die.
you think I'm afraid of dying?
I think you ain't done making us miserable.
otherwise, why would you have come all the way over to the pentagon just to sort this out?
look, son,
I don't need anybody's help. I never have.
like I told you when you were growing up, a real soldier fights his own battles.
Roger that, sir.
I just hope you don't let your pride kill you.
Major.- Miss Liston.
thought you'd be heading for the airport.
well, I just wanted to see if you found your father okay.
your father's here, major?
I hope you're inviting him for Christmas dinner
plenty for everybody.
thank you, sergeant, but I don't think that'd be a very good idea.
I'll catch up.
Yes, sir.
look, sonny, I appreciate your concern, but the old man made it pretty clear he wants me to stay the hell out of this.
well, he did ask for my help, so I have made a few calls about pulling his service records.
it's not as easy as I thought it was gonna be.
apparently, he was off the book for most of his time in Vietnam.
he was part of Mac - V SOG.
you know how I feel about acronyms.
military assistance command, Vietnam special operations group.
it was the precursor to sod.
Oh, like father like son. - Bite your tongue.
look, just because those records aren't sitting on someone's hard drive - does not mean that they don't exist. - Look, sonny, this isn't your problem.
it's his, all right?
so go home, see your family.
know what? I've already pushed my flight.
I have plenty of time.
why are you doing this?
maybe because the director of the joint staff asked me to.
or because there's a man that's alone and sick at Christmas.
or maybe because I just have trouble saying no to men named Tisnewski.
ma,
I've planned special operations all around the world.
I'm sure I can handle some roast beef.
I got to go.
Yes.
05: 00
love you, too.
husband?
mother.
you're becoming a regular around here.
just keeping you in the loop, master sergeant.
cowboy one has landed in Baghdad.
and the remote guidance system?
it's being loaded onto his plane as we speak, and they'll be on their way to Kabul as soon as they refuel.
everything according to plan.
well, it looks like you'll get out in time for Christmas dinner.
I'm not so big on Christmas.
besides, I doubt anyone at Fort Myer will mind if I show up a little late.
you can't really dry out a processed turkey.
get major Tisnewski. We've got a problem.
looks like we've got a couple of grinches.
you see those spikes in the radar?
they showed up just as cowboy one landed in Baghdad, and then they disappeared.
surface-to-air missiles?
my guess-- insurgents waiting to take potshots at planes taking off from Baghdad international.
so, let's take them out.
radar spike was gone before the fast reaction force showed up.
which means the missiles are shoulder fired-- portable.
assistant secretary Murphy just called, sir.
he wants the operation shut down. - Again?
"in light of the new security threat" , sir, he said, and I quote...
tell the major "his 'think big' P. R. Gesture "is turning into a disaster.
quit while you're behind.
sir, we can smoke out the insurgents, remove the threat, keep the secdef's plane safe.
lay it on me, major.
we use an iron hand, sir.
an EA6B prowler.
a decoy for the secdef's plane.
it sends off a fake signal to make it seem like a big, juicy target, but it's maneuverable enough to avoid taking a hit.
the insurgents will engage their Sams...
and they'll shoot at the decoy.
the decoy can then trace the origin of the missile.
we'll direct a combat air patrol of F-16's to that target...
fire away...
and watch 'em scatter.
and just like that, cowboy one is clear for takeoff.
nice work, major.
thank you, sir.
now, what do you say we get Santa's sleigh to Kabul.
the most common way Vietnam vets contracted hepatitis C was through battlefield blood transfusions.
that's how colonel Tisnewski claims he was infected, but how do we prove that to the veteran's administration?
that's easier said than done, Ms. Liston.
my job at the department of defense is to advocate for the health concerns of all our men and women in uniform.
unfortunately, most of that health care is administered by the VA.
which is even more of a bureaucratic nightmare than the pentagon.
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.
has colonel Tisnewski considered private coverage?
because it's considered a preexisting condition.
a rock and a hard place.
well, I refuse to believe there's nothing we can do for him.
if you have the time and the clearance, there might be a way to prove he was where he says he was.
I hope the files you're looking for are here, Ms. Liston, and not over in the national archives in Maryland.
that place is a maze.
as opposed to this place?
my guess is your friend's records are on microfiche, but the only microfiche machine we have has been acting very temperamental lately.
what time does your flight leave?
we've got a special delivery coming your way, sergeant.
secdef's plane has just left Baghdad, loaded up some remote guidance devices and it's on its way to Kabul.
that's incredible, sir.
well, they don't call the man's plane cowboy one for nothing.
we'll load those supply pallet son a C-130, sergeant, fly it over the village and all you boys have to do is laser-designate the target.
I'd like you to thank the man for me, admiral, on behalf of my men and the people of chakaran.
I will.
the man you really should thank is major Tisnewski. It was his idea.
I should have known.
don't count your blessings yet, sergeant.
mother nature isn't cooperating.
captain.
the low pressure area is widening and the winds have picked up.
I'm predicting up to 30 centimeters of snow.
starting in less than six hours.
can we get those supplies in before the storm hits?
affirmative, sir, but sergeant Guitterez and his team are going to be snowed in.
nothing better than a white Christmas, sir, and I know a village where we can get a warm bed.
what I'm worried about is that those Taliban up on that ridge are going to get the same idea.
how do you propose keeping them out of the village, major?
sergeant, take a look at your map.
go tight on the grid at sector seven.
all right, there's a ravine bordering the village in the mountains.
see it?
there's a bridge there.
it's three clicks from the village, sir.
but to get there the Taliban would have to cross it.
it's the only way in.
what are you suggesting, major?
it's very simple, sir.
we blow the sucker up.
Hey, Charlie, I got the specs on that bridge.
man, I thought you said no gifts.
don't worry about a thank-you note.
we got you some good IMINT.
got it scaled for pillar diagrams and span girths.
I don't want you going commando.
well, lay it on me, boss, 'cause there's no way we're going to get eyes-on.
just going to have to ride in and do that thing.
the pillars are 12 feet in circumference.
reinforced concrete cross bands on a Roman arch.
now the weakest spans will be in the middle third, far or near side.
sounds like a job for my famous basket-weave counter force charge.
going to drop that sucker right into the ravine.
I'll burst you the pics and specs in five minutes
Roger that, major.
sir...
I'm going to turn this Christmas into a fourth of July.
Mr. Weston, take a look at this.
major Tisnewski mentioned his father flew phantoms in Vietnam.
this after-action report was about an F-4 phantom crash in northeastern Cambodia.
well, that would explain why it's so top-secret.
the U. S. Was never officially in Cambodia until 1970.
well, the Nixon administration may not have admitted they were there, but according to this, both pilots got emergency blood transfusions.
and look
look at this squadron number on major Tisnewski's plane.
it's a match. - Yeah.
looks like you found your smoking gun, counselor.
lieutenant, can I get a copy of this?
you got a sitrep for me, major?
Yes, sir.
the task force is making its way to the bridge.
ride, Sally, ride.
Yes, sir.
so far, the Taliban still haven't come down from the bridge.
so why the long face, kid?
this morning you were chewing on candy canes.
this morning, this mission wasn't so complicated.
Yeah, and your father was 800 miles away.
Admiral Cooper mentioned that he was here.
and I hope you're bringing him to Pierce's for prime rib, 'cause the man's a legend and I would love to swap war stories with him.
and I'm sure he would enjoy that, too, sir, but he's not going to spend Christmas with me.
never has.
always on duty, huh?
always volunteered.
what kind of man volunteers for work on Christmas?
I'm looking at one right now.
Oh, come on, sir, that's different.
I don't have a wife and kid.
did you ever wonder why that is?
probably because I don't want to put them through the same wringer he put my mom through.
what makes you think that you would?
you've got the man's name, Jt.
that doesn't mean you're him.
should probably pay attention to our guys out there who do have families waiting on them, sir.
you're right.
I don't understand.
what is this?
the report you requested.
but all the pertinent information's been blacked out.
the crash site, the squadron number, the injuries sustained by the pilots.
Yes, Ma'am, it's the redacted version.
but I need the original to send to the veteran's administration.
this is the only version authorized for release.
and why didn't you tell me that before I spent all this time?
sorry, Ma'am.
I'm just filling in for the joint staff historian.
I assumed you knew.
this man devoted his whole life to fight for this country, and now he's going to die because he can't beat the bureaucracy.
there might be another way.
so, Ms. Liston, you got some news for me?
Yes, sir, I found the after-action report for your crash.
and there is a record of the transfusion.
well, there you go.
I told those lunkheads at the VA-- just give me my damn pills.
well, it isn't exactly that simple.
what are you talking about?
it's cut-and-dried. - Well, if you'll just let me explain...
no, I'm tired of explanations.
I'm tired of getting the run around from a bunch of bureaucrats and lawyers who never lifted a finger to fight...
sir, are you okay?
I'm fine.
can I get some help in here now!
we've got tangos in sectors nine and ten heading directly for our team's position.
get centcom to warn task force.
major, Ms. Liston just called.
it's your father-- he just collapsed.
he's in the infirmary.
thank you, master sergeant.
captain, get centcomon the horn now.
aren't you coming, sir?
I'm dealing with a situation here, Pierce.
we've got this covered, son. You go.
no, sir. I want to stick around, make sure it gets done.
I'm giving you an order, major.
Yes, sir.
what are you doing here?
checking to see if you're going to die on me.
you'd like that, wouldn't you?
no such luck.
doctor says you're going to make it.
just a high T-cell count and stress from your situation.
stress is a Viet conganti aircraft battery.
this is nothing.
well, god ain't gonna fix it for you.
your liver is failing. You need those meds.
listen to you talking about god.
when's the last time you went to church?
and quit butting into my business-- you and that lawyer.
that lawyer may have saved your life.
out of the goodness of her own heart, she postponed her own holiday plans to find you documentation on your blood transfusion.
a lot of good it's going to do me.
information's classified.
she also discovered that Frank Dane was on that plane with you.
so? - So, he's a witness.
apparently he makes a sworn statement corroborating your story about the transfusion, the VA has to grant you a service connection for your condition.
you get your meds.
but isn't that statement classified?
not if it doesn't reveal operational details.
that doesn't matter.
I haven't seen Frank Dane in 15 years.
I'm not dragging him into this.
Frank Dane was your best friend.
hell, you spent Christmas with him every year instead of your own family.
why was that, sir?
I mean, I've been wondering about that.
was it so awful to be with us?
Christmas 1972 was when Frank and me got shot down.
we made it; Kip Sweeney didn't.
he was my wingman.
a Sam 7 missile took him out.
I saw him evaporate.
the memory was... beyond awful.
I relived it every Christmas.
would you have me bring that back to my wife and kids?
well, maybe it would've helped you...
forget about it for a little while, to be with your own family.
is that what you would've done?
gone home to cry on your woman's shoulder?
sir, either you call Frank and ask him to corroborate your story, or I'll do it.
and then I'll call everyone else you know, and I'll tell them I had to save the old man's ass.
let's get these charges deployed!
how we doing, boys?
a few more minutes, Charlie.
what's our status, sir?
we've got at least 65 tangos headed toward the bridge . e.t. A?
Oh, the first patrol will be there any minute.
what about sergeant Guitterez?
can we get the task force back on the horn?
I think they're a little busy, major.
can't hold 'em off forever, boys-- we're out of time!
let's go!
come on, Charlie, get a move on.
sorry, boys, bridge is closed for repairs.
target is destroyed, sir.
don't celebrate yet, kid.
those supply pallets have been loaded onto the C-130, but saint nick's still got to get those toys down the chimney.
Roger that, sir. Captain.
call centcom right away, get that air corridor open now.
it's Angel 5-1, we're on approach.
angel 5-1, perimeter is secure. Begin your run.
you ready, sergeant?
waiting with open arms, sir.
time on target. Time now.
we got a green light. Go, go, go, go!
Roger that. We have a visual. 12 good canopies.
I hope your boys are recording this, major.
affirmative, sir.
I want as much video as I can get.
the press is gonna eat this up.
no offense, sir, I'm a little more worried about those villagers getting their food.
we have laser designation of target.
first pallet is center mass of drop zone.
nice shooting, angel one!
12 pallets deployed, 12 pallets confirmed received.
Yeah!
merry Christmas, sergeant, from the United States army to the people of chakaran.
I'll tell them, sir.
merry Christmas, Aarif.
master sergeant Meeks.
are you still here?
thought you had a Christmas dinner to cook.
that's why I'm here.
I thought since you were new in town that you wouldn't have a place to spend the holiday.
that's real nice of you.
you sure your husband won't mind?
it's prime rib, Meeks, not a date.
sorry, I was just...
but if you want to have processed turkey dinner in the mess hall at Fort Myer,
I'm not gonna stop you.
all right. What time should I be there?
17:00 hours sharp.
and just for the record, Meeks, no, I'm not married.
not anymore.
you still here, sir?
Frank Dane still has my back after all these years.
well, I'm glad it worked out.
and you can thank that lawyer for me.
I will.
good to see you, son.
you're good at a lot of things, sir, but lying isn't one of them.
I'll see you around, Jimmy.
say hello to your mother for me.
Roger that, sir.
sir?
some of us are getting together for Christmas dinner at master sergeant Pierce's house.
she's a marine.
asked me to invite you.
Colonel Mcnulty's gonna be there, too.
he, uh, he wanted to meet you.
and what about you?
what about me?
do you want me there?
of course.
there's one thing you are better at than me.
what's that?
lying.
merry Christmas, son.
merry Christmas, dad.
Where's he going? - No idea.
don't tell me you haven't left for the airport yet.
Oh, all the flights were canceled
bad weather in the midwest.
Oh, look, sonny, I'm sorry.
if you hadn't been digging through classified files for my father, you could've been out of here last night.
do I look broken up about it?
what, you don't want to go home?
you know when I said that I understood what it's like to have divorced parents?
mine compete for my time like I was a little girl.
negotiating a treaty between the two Koreas would be less stressful.
less stressful than a visit from Tisnewski, sir?
it's always easier to deal with someone else's family than your own.
well, you can't spend Christmas alone, counselor.
what do you have in mind?
Yeah, we're friends with, uh, master sergeant Pierce. Is she in?
I think we've met once or twice, major.
you look beautiful, Jocelyn.
thank you, Ms. Liston.
Pierce, is that you?
you look like you could use some eggnog, sir.
double rum, please.
Roger that, sir. Come on in.
at approximately 5: 00 P. M. Local time, the secretary of defense landed at Bahgram air force base in Afghanistan to personally deliver technology that allowed U. S. Special forces to distribute humanitarian aid to a remote Afghan village.
the secretary postponed his previously scheduled troop visit to Baghdad when he learned that the humanitarian mission might be scrapped unless the supplies could arrive before the bad weather set in.
not very good.
terrible use of color.
madrid, Barajas airport two weeks later.
this looks like it was painted by a five year-old.
Miller art gallery downtown Los Angeles your money's on the desk.
what a piece of crap.
please...
please don't shoot;don't shoot me.
just put the gun down.
gently.
I can't shoot.
that's the problem.
the stupid thingis busted.
well, when it comes to mr. Bartowski, my friend, busted is just a state of mind.
opening this, reconfigure that.
and ta-da--locked and loaded.
try that.
nice shot. See?
Chuck, big Mike wants to see you.
not now, Harry.
can't you see I'm with a customer?
I apologize, sir.
this is not normally how we do things at buy more.
now, Chuck!
I was just on my way to see you-- that's crazy.
pause that.
Bartowski, what is it that you want out of life?
you mean, existentially.
like, fulfillment, inner peace, that kind of a thing?
or are we talking more practically, like, lakers tickets, personal steam room...
we're talking buy more. Career objectives.
where do you see yourself in five years, ten years?
honestly?
honestly.
I have absolutely no idea.
well, then it's time you started to think about it.
as you know, there's an assistant management position open.
it's down to you and harry tang.
now, you want that job or not?
I do, I do.
uh, I'm sorry, big Mike.
I absolutely want that job.
well, then, bartowski, it's your turn to show me something.
I got some bad news.
big mike wants us to fix all of this junk in two days, or he's going to give the assistant store manager position to tang.
I'm sorry, guys. And anna.
guys is fine. I don't mind.
no, it's not right.
we need to come up with something non-gender specific.
how do we feel about "team"?
the little nerd herders?
the lesters?
Chuck's stable of hos.
hey... oh.
Oh, man, uh, heard big mike threw down the gauntlet.
wanted to come byand say I'd love to help.
but, a): I lack the skill set, and B.): Old computers give me the willies.
you have no idea how much courage it's taken just to stand here.
I'm really proudof you, buddy.
Whew! Thanks, bro.
I bring you news.
what?
your lady's here.
and if I'm not over stepping my bounds, looking good.
Hey. Hey.
give me a kiss.
I'm sorry. What?
we've been on three dates.
we have to sell it.
that's it?
I'm not really good with PDA.
hmm. Well, let's go some where more private.
shall we?
okay, he is so in.
this is... hey. Whoa! Whoa!
okay, whoa! Why don't we give the kids a little privacy?
not cool.
sorry to break up your little tryst.
next time you need to talk to the subject,
I'd appreciatea heads up.
relax. I wouldn't dream of starting without you, agent casey.
mom, dad, can we get on with it?
I have hard drives to fix.
why are these people sleeping?
they're not sleeping.
they were killed, Chuck, and we want to know why.
I have no idea.
well, look again.
I would rather not. It's kind of creepy.
Oh.
sorry. I was going to take a nap.
I'll come back in five.
kind of called dibs on the couch?
Chuck, what did you see?
um, I don't... I'm not...
I'm not totally sure.
a water lily painting, weapons, an art auction tomorrow night.
does the name la Ciudad mean anything to you?
Why?
because I think he's going to be at the art auction tomorrow night.
right then.
I'm going to go fix some hard drives.
good luck with the spy stuff. Excuse me.
Chuck, I am so proud of you.
morgan told me about the assistant management job. Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Congratulations.
team Bartowski moving up in the world, huh?
okay, first of all, it's not mine yet, and second of all, you can ease upon the enthusiasm.
it's only a two dollar an hour raise at anelectronics store, and it doesn't even give memy own parking space.
well, does your lack of interest mean that you're actually considering leaving the buy more for a real profession?
real profession? Sorry.
I'm going to need clarification on that.
he went to Stanford, for god's sakes, Morgan.
right, and was unceremoniously expelled sophomore year
sorry to bring that up, champ
but I think we need to be realistic about our goals here.
his goals or your goals?
great question, and I think we need to hammer outa plan for chuck.
where do we see him in five years? Ten years?
we?
fine. Then just you and I.
we're glad to hear you've settled into Chuck's apartment building.
but if he's right, this is a high priority.
la ciudad is the most elusive and dangerous arms dealer in the world.
and the last anyone heard, mi-6 in London had a drop on him, but he vanished.
well, if he turns up, we'll justtake him down at the auction.
not so easy.
we have no idea whathe looks like, no photographs.
no one has ever seen la Ciudad that has lived to tell about it.
so we'll bring the intersect.
everything you know about la ciudad was fed into that computer.
no way.
it is too dangerous.
he has no field experience or training.
he'll be fine.
it's an art auction.
listen to me
it is way to scary out there.
Chuck can't leave the buy more.
we're still finding ourselves.
no offense, Morgan, but I think my brother has spent quite a few years finding himself, and he's definitely proven that his place in life is not at the buy more.
you don't understand.
he is a fragile little Gelding.
you know, still trying to find his legs.
the real world will crush him.
do you know what a gelding is?
it's the...
that weird creature from the dark crystal.
smells like Gelding. That-that guy.
he'll be fine.
la ciudad probably won't even be there.
and if he is, is it worth the risk?
all right, I've heard enough.
put him in the field.
we don't know what he's capable of until he's been tested.
what he needs is something to challenge him.
to test his limitations.
a brush with his own mortality.
you know what I'm thinking?
I have no idea what you're thinking.
as far as I'm concerned, dude, you're way off the reservation.
class five white water rapids.
just the two of us this weekend.
near-death experience.
awesome!
that sounds great, but my wet suit sat the dry cleaners.
that is a terrible idea.
that's way too dangerous.
I agree, and I am not comfortable with you guys spending that amount of time together.
well, Chuck hasn't said a word.
what do you want to do?
I'm just going to hit the sack.
good night, Team Bartowski.
that's-that's great work, guys.
you see what you're doing here?
that's awesome.
Oh!
congratulations, Chuck.
you just got your first mission
tomorrow night.
hope you're ready for the real world, huh?
so, dress attire for this evening
uh, sneakers, or are we classifying this as more of a shoe event?
I rented you a tux.
Oh, that's very nice...
how did you know my size?
Nsa-- they have records of your rental information from prom night.
I checked the suit in your closet.
okay, this is my first foray into major under cover spy work, so you could ease up on the sarcasm.
that would be great.
and how am I supposed to recognize la ciudad?
is there a picture or something?
if there was a photograph, why would we need you?
what did we just talk about?
I'm sorry.
we're hoping something in the event triggers a flash.
see, that's all you had to say.
now, uh, hand-to-hand combat.
in all seriousness, if it comes down to me and la Ciudad in some fisticuffs or something, is there, like, a 20-minute tutorial you can take me through?
don't worry.
you're going to be fine.
nothing's going to happen to you.
assuming you know how to tango.
Seriously?
Oh, I don't joke about your life.
right.
Chuck, your girlfriend's here.
Oh! One minute, I have computers to fix.
don't worry about it.
we got it.
there's only a few left.
what? Are you sure?
it's done, but next time I have a big date, you are going to cover for me.
okay. Great. Thanks, team.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks, team.
where are you love birds headed?
we're actually going to an art auction at the wilshire grand.
Oh. Swanky!
Yeah, I like it, man.
uh, aren't we moving a little too fast now?
career, girl.
guy's got it all.
the idea with a cover is to keep it as simple as possible without revealing true personal detail.
any thoughts on a name?
simple, dignified.
easy to remember and not far off from... graduated with honors from Stanford.
runs a hugely successful software company.
semi-retired and is considering entering america's cup.
have you done this before?
let's just say, uh, Mr. Carmichael and I share a small kinship.
how's that?
when I first entered Stanford, it's kind of where I envisioned myself being by now, except for the sailing part.
I don't really know where that came from.
but he's where most of my classalready is.
so, what happened?
my life took a little detour sophomore year when our old friend Bryce Larkin discovered stolen tests under my bed, and was kind enoughto alert administration.
did you steal the tests?
I thought it was kind of implied that I'm a decent person.
well, we all make mistakes.
and I made plenty. That just wasn't one of them.
but, hey, then bryce sent mea whole database of government secrets that are now locked in my brain, keeping me in a constant state of fear, danger and anxiety, so I'd say we're even.
don't worry about tonight.
no reason to be nervous.
I am not going to leave your side.
me nervous?
come on. Never.
your hand is a little moist.
it does that when I'm freaking out.
Hey, sis.
Hey, sis, um...
do you know how to tango?
no, why?
Oh, no reason.
I just, I have a date tonight.
I thought it might come up.
you're tangoing on a date?
well, that's definitely new territory.
it's good to see you reaching outside of your comfort zone.
well, considering my comfort zone extends to the end of that couch, new territory was bound to come up.
did someone say "tango"?
no, thank you, captain awesome, I'll look it up online.
would you please put on something, a robe or something?
did a semester abroadin buenos aires.
spent many a night tangoing my way
and... go.
there's no way he's going to break the two minute record.
Ooh, there. It's okay, sweetheart.
Lester is right here.
sorry to interrupt.
but we found just a few more down by the loading dock.
Where's Bartowski?
on a date with a smoking hot wiener girl, no biggie.
and he left you all here?
good leadership.
real good.
well, it shouldn't be too difficult to get these done by morning.
I'll leave the coffee pot on.
done.
what are those?
Morgan, what are those?
tank.
here.
this is for you.
inside the watch is a tracking system.
that way you can't run away from me.
and if you flash on anyone, tell me immediately and then stay out of the way.
absolutely, yeah.
I, uh, I always runfrom a fight.
this isn't a joke, Chuck.
no one who's ever seen you has lived to tell about it.
is he being serious? Seriously?
what are my chances of getting into trouble?
toughen up, you'll be fine...
assuming you know how to tango.
I did somepreparation, okay?
I wouldn't call myself an expert...
why would he need to know how to tango? Is that code?
no, not-- no, he told me that I needed to know how to tango...
spy humor, I like that.
come on, you ready?
okay, wait, wait.
Where's everybody going, huh?
we got computers to fix.
sorry, bro, I got mybar mitzvah lesson.
internet poker.
I'm off by 8: 00 and hammered by 8: 05.
what about Chuck Bartowski?
okay, what about our fearless leader? We owe him.
for what? What?
cause tonight, Chuck Bartowski's boldly going where none of ushave ever gone before
to have intercourse with a beautiful woman.
speak for yourself.
interesting. Interesting.
I didn't check.
I'm out of here. I gotta go.
Anna, could I-- Anna?
okay. Okay, fine.
see you guys.
big Michael just gave the position to Harry Tang.
Oh, have I got your attention now?
good. Good, 'cause you know what that means?
no more two-hour lunch breaks.
no more xbox tournaments.
no more porn.
Yeah, yeah.
total work hell.
I'm in, but your boy better close the deal.
let's do this.
okay, thanks a lot, Lester. Don't touch me.
I'm going to talk to you about this whole girl thing.
Hey, Jeff, atta boy, huh?
Oh, nice, yes, thank you.
sir
Oh, nice.
I've been a spy all of five seconds and I already have soy sauce on my shirt.
well, go and wash it off.
and Chuck, stop saying that you're a spy.
right, of course.
idiot.
do we know each other?
no. No, not that I know of.
sorry.
it's him. Who?
come on.
I've already identified the perp, as it were, what are we still doing here?
I mean, you know, mission accomplished. Time to go.
Chuck, go wait at the bar.
go wait... wait at the bar?
okay, you go do what you do.
I'm going to beat the bar, waiting there.
covering that whole area.
drink, sir?
Yeah, uh...
I'd like a martini, barkeep, shaken and stirred. Thank you.
would you like a cherry with that?
no.
the name's Carmichael.
Allan watter man, Stanford?
Hey, hey, how are you?
Hey. Hey, you. Hey.
I'm great. I don't know if you heard,
I sold out of my software company.
kind of unemployed.
problem is, I'm too young to retire.
I'm too rich to work.
that's quite a pickle you find yourself in, watter man.
what are you doing now?
last I heard, you were, um, you were fixing computers or something? Yeah.
you know, just kind of, uh, just kind of weighingmy options right now.
uh, you know, I may be getting a managerial position at an electronics conglomerate, so, you know...all right.
well, I always knew you'd make something of yourself. Who are you here with?
Oh, my date. She's right over there.
Oh. She's with you? Hm.
we have a very open relationship.
well, hey, um, give me a call.
you know, if you need help with the whole job thing.
I know people.
bet you do, yeah.
Yeah. There you go.
insider trading and off shore accounts in the caymans.
what did you just say?
do you work for the sec?
I got to go.
something fishy going on.
I know you guys think Chuck's a great guy and all that, but that weiner girlis super hot.
even for me.
it's obvious, dude.
she's a pro. Are you kidding?
do you think chuck could afford her if she was a pro?
all right, you know what, guys? Enough crapping about.
all right, break time's over, let's go.
all right, who's up for a game of "deerhunter"?
done. No, no, no, no, no.
guys, guys, guys, work now, play later, okay?
we've got hard drives to fix.
look at this place, come on.
let's go.
Oh, no.
Oh, no" what?
the lock is broken, man.
you needa key to open it.
then get the key, Jeff.
there's only two keys.
Harry tang has one.
and old Chuck has the other one.
Yikes.
where are you going? Don't, don't--no, no, no, no, no!
come on, old computers freak me out!
somebody get me-- Anna help me!
John, get me out of here, please!
hit me again.
you stay.
"Stay"? -- like a dog.
beautiful painting.
what's that?
Yeah, beautiful.
painting, yeah.
it definitely hasa quality about it.
very, I would say, bob rossian in its influence. Who?
Bob Ross, you know, Bob Ross.
the guy who used to paint on PBS.
with the afro and the soothing.
you have no idea what I'm talking about.
sorry.
it won't be the first time.
I'm Malena.
Hi. Chuck.
so you don't like the painting?
no, I， it seems very lovely.
I just more interested in the frame, but that-- you don't...
Oh...
so sorry.
so sorry about this.
work never leaves you alone.
I'm in the software game, so...
so you were saying about the frame?
nothing, it doesn't really actually matter, sorry.
champagne?
sure, yeah.
thank you. Cheers.
Cheers.
what's your real name?
and who do you work for?
Mmm! I love a tango.
Oh, yeah. Who doesn't?
do you?
do-- oh, do I want to, uh...
um...
you know what, what the hell.
Yeah, let's give it a shot.
what are you doing here? Please don't lie.
it'll make this much more painful.
Mr. Carmichael...
please. Chuck.
Chuck, I think your hand is supposed to be on my hip.
right. Uh, apparently,
I learned the girl's part of this dance.
would you mind leading?
not at all.
federal agent. Don't move.
don't you move.
international agents-- mi-6.
drop your gun!
we're British secret service.
lower your weapon!
everyone take a deep breath.
I'm putting down my gun, and I'm getting my identification.
slowly.
what are you doing here?
I could ask you the same thing.
we've been pursuing an arms dealer through five countries.
let me guess,La Ciudad?
that's right.
mi-6 intercepteda painting with plutonium hidden in the frame.
rather than announce the bust, we removed the plutonium and kept the auction in the hope of La Ciudad.
if you're not La Ciudad, then where is he?
whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, okay, listen to me, so, listen to me.
my friend is at some sort of art function at your hotel, okay?
uh, now listento me clearly.
I need to speak to him.
it's a matter of life and death.
describe your friend.
he's good-looking. You know, it depends on your angle, I suppose.
uh, he's not classically handsome.
I wouldn't say he is, you know.
but he makes up for it with charm.
lots of, uh... of charm.
and he's kind of a lost soul.
does this funny little thing when he's nervous.
he laughs. He goes...
he kind of does this... uh, anyways, what, uh, what, what?
uh, brown hair, six-one. Does that help at all?
what, uh... what line of work are you in, Malena?
why are you so interested, Mr. Carmichael?
no reason.
just making conversation.
excuse me, sir. Are you Chuck Bartowski?
who, me? No!
no, I'm Carmichael.
uh, that's him. That's my...
that's my friend. I can hear his voice.
Hey, Chuck!
are you sure you're not Mr. Bartowski?
your friend insists.
no, no, I insist.
I've never heard that name in my life.
I got to go. Excuse me.
why don't we head up to my room now, Mr. Carmichael, and find out who you really are.
Oh...oh... okay.
uh, so I guess we should regroup in the morning?
good idea.
no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
where you guys going?
dude, it's just...it's out of my pay grade.
I got to get some serious alcohol in me or I am never going to sleep.
I'm sorry, Morgan. Be strong.
no, no, come on, guys, don't leave me in here with these computers.
you can hand me a slice, maybe some water.
I need to survive through the night, and I...
not cool!
let's start with an easy one.
what's your real name?
that wasn't so hard.
now...
before you answer my next question,
I want you to think long and hard about my options here.
there's the old favorite
yank out a tooth.
too noisy.
cut off a toe.
that's too messy. Far too messy.
or we can chuck you off the balcony... Chuck.
probably land face first.
teeth go through the back of your head.
not a good way to go.
so... here's my question:
who do you work for?
no one.
no, no, stop, stop!
I fix computers for a living! I swear to god!
I snuck into the party under a fake name to impress a girl! Please, please, down... put chair down!
good-bye, Chuck. No, no, no, it's a setup!
what is?
the painting? The painting.
the painting, I think.
I think the painting might be a fake or something.
Why?
if you put me down I'll tell you.
I saw a photo of the painting in the L. A. Times, okay?
but it had a different frame.
so I'm assuming somebody maybe swapped it out, I don't know.
but if I were you, I would not buy that painting.
a fake painting.
and you had no intention of bidding on it?
me? Bid on...?
no, not unless they were selling it for 25 bucks.
I mean, that's about what I havein my decorating budget.
okay, tell me howto fix a computer, Chuck.
my first inclination is that your bus speed is not up to snuff with your video card.
I'm assuming we're talking about a pc here, right?
is your memory dedicated?
that's enough, Mr. Bartowski. I believe you.
the problem is since you've seen me, now I have to kill you.
have... have to, have to? No, no, no, I disagree.
I disagree...vehemently, vehemently.
no, no, no, I won't say anything, I swear to god.
you don't know the things I know about people.
don't worry, it'll be fast.
good-bye, Mr. Bartowski.
I enjoyed our tango.
didn't like it that much.
Really? He was kind of silly.
Oh, I kind of liked him.
Hi.
they're on to us.
the sec knows everything.
Shelly, they know about the Caymans.
I surrender! I surrender!
get down, Chuck.
Sarah! No!
let's do this.
Oh, my god!
it's okay, Chuck. Are you okay?
okay? Okay?
two more seconds andI'd have been dead.
they were going to throw me off the balcony.
did you tell them you work for us?
of course not.
where the hell were you guys?
you're still alive.
I'd consider myself lucky.
we have to get you out of the country.
first we take him out.
Hey. How was the big date?
it was good, great, fine.
I'm going to go to bed. I love you.
what? No, no, no, no. Is that all I get?
come on, sit down.
I want to know, you know, do you like this girl?
it's... you know, it's complicated.
well, explain it to me slowly, I'll catch up.
she's a very beautiful girl.
good. Go on.
and she's very agile.
I'm not sure how that applies, but continue.
and I think she's too exhausting for me.
well, what happened?
did you guys tango?
Oh, yeah, yeah. We tangoed.
in fact, we tangoed quite a bit, but awesome taught me the woman's pa of the tango, so it was a little difficult, as one might expect.
what's up, bro?
did you do the famous dip?
Yeah. I was on there ceiving end of that dip.
you did tango with a woman, right?
and on that note...
no, no, no, no, no.
you're not getting off that easy.
why won't you talk to me?
it's...
it's complicated, okay? Just let it go.
fine.
you don't wantto talk to me,
I suggest you find someone to talk to like maybe your idiot friend.
he's called about 75 times.
he locked himselfin a storage cage.
whatever that means.
Oh, god! It's you.
dude, dude, you have no idea.
okay, okay, okay. Settle down, settle down, settle down.
settle down it's all good. It's all good.
what happened?
Oh, what happened?
tang showed up, and he dropped all these off.
I guess he was stashing them, you know? So...
all right, let's do this.
what are you talking...? Morgan, you don't know how to fix a computer.
moral support, man.
never... never leave your wing man, okay?
something your team could learn a little something about.
look, it's okay, man.
go get some sleep, okay?
are you sure?'Cause you say the word and we go down together.
no. I appreciate that, but I think it'll be nice to do something I'm actually good at, so I'll see you.
fantastic. I'll see you later. Good night.
good night.
you finished, Bartowski?
mission accomplished.
Whoa! Two days was meant as an incentive.
I didn't think you'd really do it. I'm impressed.
and I'm not a man easily impressed.
why, I think you should know that I only fixed the last few--my team did most of the work.
they deserve the credit. And you're only as good as your team, so...
first rule of management: Always take credit.
hope we can sell all this crap.
sir, there's been a major infraction
drinking alcoholic beverages on the property.
nothing wrong with a man wetting his whistle every once in a while.
keep it out of the store, Bartowski.
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely, sir.
you get extra points for style.
looking sharp.
you look like a waiter.
kiss-ass.
was I scared? Yeah, I was scared.
but then this survival instinct kicked in.
something I didn't even know I possessed.
a desire to live.
good news is, I may be able to retire off this, all right?
I talked to big Mike.
I told him he'd be hearing from my attorney.
that cage is a major fire hazard.
good work last night.
okay, you know what?
I'm working on an all-night here, big guy.
and I realize that you are probably armed.
and so I'm gonna ask you very nicely, would you please ease up on the sarcasm.
I wasn't being facetious.
you helped us find La Ciudad.
but she got away.
Yeah, we got a photo from hotel security.
we got a blood sample from a broken window.
our intel tell us she's heading down to central America.
we have people waiting there.
you're lookin' sharp.
Yeah, thanks.
that was facetious.
idiot.
I fixed this one personally.
so it should be good as new.
and sorry about the delay.
Chuck, hiding from work again?
I, uh, I-I thinkI dropped something.
go away, Harry!
Oh, you wish I would. I'm not going anywhere, Chuck.
when you go to sleep at night, all you're gonna see is tang in your face.
excuse, please.
where can I find Chuck Bartowski?
why, what's he done?
because I need to speak to him.
okay, well, if he's in any kind of trouble, let me know.
Chuck, you have a visitor.
well, uh, maybeI can help you, sir.
I think we have some company.
I'm on it.
Chuck Bartowski, to the storage cage.
Chuck Bartowski, please report to the storage cage.
Where's the storage cage?
Oh, just through here, sir.
I'll show you.
by the way we are having a big sale on refrigerators in case you didn't notice.
whoa.
where is he? Where is Chuck Bartowski?
sir, I'm just sales clerk. Take me to him now!
Oh, you!
you big 'ol guy...you think...
that was so broken this morning.
now that's what I callmoving some merchandise, yeah?
Yeah.
hang here.
uh, Charles Irving Bartowski of the Encino Bartowskis, could you please report to the returns desk.
what?
nothing, nothing.
I'm just loving this thing, man.
you know what? We should get one for your apartment.
Oh, good news. They fixed the lock onthe storage cage, so...
What?!
I'm really sorry, sis.
I know that I've been kind of evasive.
it's just that I...I didn't want to lie to you and I chose not saying anything as being the lesser of two evils.
why would you have to lie to me?
Ellie, I just need you to trust me and know it has nothing to do with you.
but you want me to butt out.
I get it. It's none of my business.
No! No, no, no, no, I'm not saying that!
I'm not saying that. I-I...
I just don't want to create a false sense of excitement for a relationship that seems doomed.
why is it doomed?
because she's not into me.
I have seen the way that girl looks at you and she is into you.
Really?
it's none of my business.
okay, no. Okay, fine. What the hell.
what do you, what do you want to ask me about Sarah?
Really?
you better hurry up.
this offer will not last.
okay. Do you like her?
Yeah.
Hah! Da-da-da-- no, no, unnecessary excitements.
sorry. Sorry.
what else? That's it.
that's it?!
Yeah. Chuck, that's it.
I don't need to know the intimate details, okay?
as long as you're happy, that's enough for me.
and I don't, I don't want to nag you about your future and your job.
I don't wantto be the sister that just pestersyou into oblivion.
no, no, no, no, you're, you're not a pest.
I just know what an incredible guy charles Bartowski is ...and sometimes I'm not so sure that he knows it.
how do you feel about a brother-sister hug situation right now?
I'm open to it.
okay.
Oh, I'll get it.
sorry. I thought we had plans tonight, you know?
what is she doing here?
what, uh, what gave you that impression?
uh, when you were leaving earlier and you were, like, "see you later, dude."
took you at your word.
it's cool if you don't want me to be here,that's fine.
just gotta stop giving me mixed signals.
come on in.
super. Awesome. What are we having?
here you go.
Oh, thank you.
thank you.
Ouch. You okay? Uh, occupational hazard.
she got in a lucky kick.
the wine ?
congratulations on your first mission.
you did really good, Chuck.
stop it. I'm not really a spy.
your computer ended up in the head of a guy who only knows how to fix 'em, nothing else.
you survived a near-death experience under the threat of torture and apprehended one of the world's most elusive killers.
I'm not sure you what you think spies do exactly, but most of us would consider that a pretty good day.
okay, sure, so today I helped take down a major internation alarms dealer, but tomorrow, tomorrow I still gotta go clock in at buy more.
I mean, what's the good of being a hero if nobody knows about it?
you know.
and so do I.
you know, if we were really dating, this would bethe part where
I'd be forced to kiss you good night.
forced?
would it be so bad?
I'm sure I could suffer through it.
me, too.
man, that dude is creepy.
agreed.
here are a few things that you might need to know.
there's no scenario in which you should be going to dinner with the girl that dumped you, broke your heart and slept with you best friend.
what about your cover girlfriend?
won't she be jealous?
our relationship's a cover.
you know, there's nothing to be jealous about.
Chuck this is my boss, guy lefleur.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
mi-6 has reports that he may have developed a bioweapon which he plans to sell to the highest bidder.
the assass in agent Walker shot was a member of fulcrum.
if Jill knows something, they may make a play for her.
the sensor will be blind for 20 seconds.
welcome to the world of international espionage.
very handy for picnics.
I have to say, I still can't wrap my head around the idea of you as a spy.
you never told me how that happened.
you don't choose your profession, Jill.
the right job chooses you.
still-- never would've guessed it.
well, how about you soak up this romantic view.
Yeah, real romantic.
what? This is the buy more roof.
you smell that? You smell what you're smelling right now?
that is rarefied air, that very few people ever get to experience.
not to mention the fact that there aren't a lot of places
I can go that aren't under constant surveillance.
the government finds me very...
very valuable.
well, I can't say that I blame them.
you've got to be kidding me.
wait, hold on.
give me a break.
are you kidding me? I've got her here.
we're having some food.
amateur. -Casey, is that necessary?
how much trouble can he get into on a date?
it's Bartowski.
you're pretty nonchalant about your super computer boyfriend trying to browse someone else's network.
well, I am just this cover girlfriend...
with your bank of monitors. You get off on this, don't you?
Chuck's entitled to a real one.
major Casey, agent Walker.
I have the intel on your new mission.
but it's going to require some unorthodox reconnaissance.
turns out our deceased doctor, guy Lefleur, obtained a list of cia code names for the agents he worked with.
we have reason to believe it's a list of fulcrum operatives.
this may be our only chance to find the corrupt agents within our ranks.
great.
and where's the list now?
intel thinks it's hidden in Guy's hotel room at the waldron.
we have to get that list before fulcrum does.
you need to take the intersect in off-the-record and see if he can flash.
perhaps Chuck can find out where the list is hidden.
you want us to break into a government-controlled crime scene?
it's the FBI. How hard can it be?
bogie at 5: 00.
I'll handle this.
Really? A camera on the roof because of what?
all the terrorist activity on top of the buy more?
okay, casey may have been a little aggressive, but we just received our new mission.
already? -Tomorrow we're going to break into guy Lefleur's hotel room.
we think he might have a listof all the fulcrum agents that were black mailing him.
okay.
can we talk about this tomorrow?
because I have Jill waiting for me in the car.
of course. -Okay, thanks.
is everything all right?
yeah...
Yeah, I'm fine.
why do you ask? Or is this some spy thing?
some psych evaluation or something like that?
it's a friend thing.
I just want to make sure you're okay.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm great.
being with Jill, is...is...
it's like having my old life back, you know?
and not to bashon our cover, but I'd forgotten what it's like to be with someone who knows the real me.
well, from everything I've seen, she seems like a great girl.
well, if you could see a little less.
maybe ease upon the whole Chuck Bartowski 24-hour surveillance.
Yeah, I'll talk to casey.
you deserve your privacy, Chuck.
thank you.
okay.
where does Chuck go?
so Sarah said there's going to be an easing up of the Chuck surveillance.
you're a government asset, Chuck.
sometimes your personal life has to take a backseat.
we tried the backseat.
you have a camerain the car, too.
come on, how many...
how many second chances do you get with the one who got away?
Plus, she already knows I'm ...you know.
I'm not even interested in my own feelings, Bartowski.
keep your mind on the mission.
we leave in ten.
Hey, chuck.
morning.
canada has just delivered its most delightful giftsince Shania Twain.
behold the q-36 game copier.
check it out-- now all wehave to do is rent a game, rip it, and we never have to pay for our entertainment again.
Yeah, big Mike's going to be thrilled seeing as how we sellvideo games.
come on, dude, this thing can ignoreall forms of copy protection.
it can copy anything.
highly illegal.
what's illegal, gentlemen?
going to smoke some weed on your lunch break?
a little reefer?
ganja?
I have heard the loading dockis likea five for fighting concert.
so fierce.
Chuck, can I see you in my office, please?
uh, sorry, Emmett, can't.
got to go.
Oh, really?
where?
it's an off-sitein stall.
it's probably going to take a while, so...
see ya.
you're going to a hotel tonight with your cover girlfriend?
well, uh, you know, I mean, if it's any comfort...
overnight missions normally involve case yand a whole lot of fire arms.
so, nothing romantic about it.
so what is this Sarah like?
is she pretty?
um, well...
I could understand how a typical heterosexual male might find heraes the tically pleasing, you know.
and if someone were to ask me, "Chuck, technically, objectively, do you find your Ciahandler Sarah attractive?＂
then I might say,"technically, objectively...＂
sure.
and all those missions you go on, it's not exciting and romantic?
look, you got it all wrong.
there is nothing about this job that's glamorous or sexy.
all right.
Hi-oh.
was it absolutely necessary for you to dress up like...
an escort?
Yeah, an escort.
and why exactly is Mr. Carmichael paying you to have sex with me...
him?
the Waldron is notorious for its high-end business men and their trysts.
it's our cover, so sell it.
wonder how much that costs?
I've got the security feed.
it looks like the FBI has guy's room on lock down.
won't be asking permission before we slip in.
we'll just enter through the ventilation system.
Hey, hey...
how long is this going to take?
what's the matter, Bartowski, you got a date?
actually, yes.
you okay?
why don't you just call ahead and let them know we're coming?
sorry.
idiot. -I'm just trying to figure out what time I'm going to be home.
well, just dothe cover math.
how long would it take for a business man to have sex with a prostitute?
stupid phone.
Hello?
Sarah, you think this shouldn't take us more than an hour to have sex from start to finish?
and...
begin.
what...
what am I...
what am I doing wrong here?
well, just move your hips a little to the left.
okay...
this is way more exhausting than I thought it would be.
well, we can't jus trace right through it.
your knees aren't hurting?
what, did you go to a school to learn how to do this?
Hey, how are you?
Hello, Emmett.
I was just coming in here to get a snack.
Oh, you do not need a snack. Please.
okay.
Morgan, I want you to imagine, for a moment, that buy more is a country.
Ah, buy Moria.
Yes.
how did you know that?
I've thought about it for years.
this is fantastic.
now, imagine that all its employees are the states that make up this great nation.
Yeah, I can dig it.
and, if you will, one of these states is looking to secede from the union.
okay, wait a minute.
you're questioning Chuck's patriotism towards buy Moria?
no.
where does he go all the time?
I don't see receipts for all the off-site installs he does.
what is he into, Morgan?
uppers?
glue?
a baby mama?
dude, you are out of your mind.
maybe I am.
maybe I'm so far out of my mind that
I've gotten myself all crawled up inside of yours.
let's see.
Oh.
this could be grounds for deportation from buy Moria.
you wouldn't.
help me, Morgan.
help me help Chuck.
Chuck doesn't need our help.
don't matter what she said.
afternoon guard duty is boring.
here.
what are you doing up there?
help!
it's the FBI. They're dumb, not deaf.
Thanks.
sorry.
and then she shoves him in the pool.
I swear, if it wasn't for the xanax, she would have ripped his...
Hey, man.
I didn't expect to see you today.
well, never a day off when you need it.
does the word "silent" have a different meaning in geek that I'm not aware of?
look, I'm sorry. I thought it was on vibrate.
at least I got the list.
it's a Venetian puzzle box.
very popular with renaissance spies.
it's locked.
hey-- beh, beh, beh.
the running, jumping, shooting people part of the job, that's all you guys.
but the puzzles, that's all me.
I think it would be numerals one through12 in a row.
but these boxes used a complicated fib on a cci sequence.
let's see what we got.
Oh, Casey, gas!
be right back with a containment unit.
well, is it off? Get it off me!
take your clothes off! Get in the shower now, quick!
off! Get it off!
pants off, come on! -I'm trying!
hurry up!
get in, get in, get in.
Oh, cold! So-so-so cold!
use the soap!
wash it!
get the--oh, sorry, sorry!
I'm trying to--I'm not trying to...
wash your face properly.
tastes like soap! Tastes like soap! -In your hair.
Oh, god.
get the door. That's Casey.
we have no time to waste, quick.
how'd you...
the bellman sent me to your room.
I knew it.
Jill, wait! Wait, wait!
it's not what you think!
Jill, please! I could be dying!
how long...
how long does this thing take?
how does Jill pick that exact moment to walk in on us?
I mean, what are the odds?
does this, does this give us the antidote?
because I think I feel my throat is closing up on me right now.
what is it?
what is it, flesh-eating bacteriaor anthrax?
am I gonna die?
Nope.
but you can add ice and give it to little kids to sell on street corners.
I knew it.
drugs.
it's powdered fruit punch, dumb ass.
wait...
so not only did we not get the fulcrum list, but Jill's never gonna speak tome again because she caught me naked, rinsing off fruit punch with another woman?
common spy problem.
Really?
I don't know what to tell you. I don't know anything.
Oh, of course you do, lester.
you've worked very closely with Charles for years.
perhaps I've overs tated the nature of our relationship.
we don't socialize much.
in fact, I've felt slighted on more than one occasion.
Oh, good.
then you won't have a problem ratting him out.
I have no ethical dilemma.
I meant I just don't know anything!
then who does?
Jeff! I would ask Jeff.
I don't rat.
only thing my mother taught me from the joint.
you want answers, talk to the injun.
Injun" is a highly derogatory term referring to native Americans, not east Indians, you cretin!＂
grab a shiv and make your move.
we should run now. He's in "prison mode.＂
shut up.
I guess I haven't made myself clear.
you both host an unsanctioned card game in this break room.
you give me something on Bartowskior no more poker night.
Chuck's cheating on his lady.
Yeah, we saw him athis brunette bird leaving some fancy, real-silver ware joint a couple of nights ago.
she's not as well-endowed as I would like.
come on.
what's her name?
who is she?
no more poker no...
you got to break Morgan.
Chuck tells him everything.
his beard holds so many secrets.
Hey, Jill.
it's me again-- Chuck.
lucky message number four.
listen, I just wanted to say, I totally underst and why you're not calling me back.
because, look, if I saw what you saw, then I'd be thinking what you're thinking, you know.
not that I presume to know what you're thinking.
it's just a logical deduction to think what you saw would be what you think, if that's in fact what you're thinking.
actually, I can explain a lot better than that, if you just call me back.
please.
at your earliest convenience. Bye.
you got to give Milbarge something, man.
if you don't, he's not gonna let us have our weekly poker game.
Yeah, don't do it for us, Morgan.
do it for buy Moria.
so, Grimes, have you thought any more about our chat this morning?
are you ready to help me help buy Moria?
Yeah, okay, Emmett.
okay.
you want to know where Chuck goes on these...
service calls?
Yes, please.
he goes and he fixes computers and computer-related software.
why do you protect him?
what does that Charle Shave over you?
um, 23 years of best friendship.
Oh, please. -I know everything there is to know about the man, but you're not gonna hear it from me.
and if you're looking for dirt, well, nothing to say, dude, 'cause Chuck Bartowski is the straightest shooter I know.
Really? -That's right.
you have a bizarre sense of straightest.
since your besty has two girlfriends.
what are you talking about?
I mean, isn't Bartowski's bimboa blonde?
I don't know if Sarah's a natural blonde.
I mean, it's kind of impolite to ask, you know.
Oh, my god, it's Jill.
thank you. I didn't know its name.
that's Chuck's old college girlfriend.
thank you again.
you're a font of information.
twice the intelligence I had before.
how could he not have told me?
Oh, you can have your poker game now.
and do not worry.
I will not tell Bartowski that his best buddy was the weak link.
Cheers.
sorry. Okay.
Jill, thank you, thank you so much for coming, Jill.
I appreciate it.
you have three seconds to convince me what I saw wasn't what I saw.
that's gonna be a little tough, because I can't get into specifics without you having to know, like, really high-level, top-secret government...
we broke into guy's room trying to find some of his research, and we found this box, but when we opened it, it sprayed this stuff all over Sarah and I, so when you saw the two of us in our underpants what you really saw was two people trying to wash off what we thought was poison but really turned out to be powdered fruit punch.
see? There. Simple.
do you believe me?
what kind of fruit punch?
okay, now you're just messing with me.
no, no. Chuck, I believe you.
Really? Because....
I was listening to what I just said right now, and I sounded completely ridiculous.
guy was crazy paranoid.
you couldn't open an e-mail without solving a puzzle first.
if he cared about something, he would have hidden it.
maybe the fruit punch was a clue.
we have to go somewhere.
but before we do, how do you feel about blind folds?
you brought her here?
Bartowski, it's not a secret location if you invite people over.
okay, but Jill here, Jill knows about Guy's puzzles.
they just found two dead FBI agents in lafleur's room.
now's not the time to be planning game night with your girlfriend.
Jill, would you please tell them what you told me, about how the fruit punch might actually be a clue.
guy's paranoia man if ested itself in obscure ways.
odd literary references, mathematical proofs.
the log-on for his computer was a randomly selected word from a piece of vogon poetry.
so what do you think the fruit punch might mean?
what kind of fruit punch was it?
uh, I guess, traditional fruit punch.
you guess?
please tell me you got the exact formula.
okay, um, is there a mass spectrometer around?
Casey, get the spectrometer.
do we have one of those?
I can see what the boysees in her, huh?
now we compare the crystal line powder's chemical composition with a list of known products.
it's, um, it's rootin' raspberry-flavored hi-C.
rootin' raspberry? Maybe...
maybe it has something to do with a football team or cheer leaders?
what about international waters?
high seas. That's good. That's good.
wait, guys, guys, this is a music box.
it's a music box.
it's not high sea-- s-e-a.
it's high "c," likea musical note-- high "C"
Where's a pitch pipe when you need one?
what?
choir boy.
what?
I wasn't hatched.
check it out!
those are opera glasses.
No...actually, they're not.
um, this is a key.
a key to a very super secret lock box.
the culper ring used to use stuff like that to pass information during there volutionary war days.
wow, Chuck, that's impressive.
Yeah, nice going there, brainiac.
but before you go getting all full of yourself
if this is the key, where's the lock?
the question, my dear casey is: Where's the opera?
you're not concerned to involve a civilian in a covert government investigation?
Ah, the girl's personal knowledge of guy Lafleur makes her of use to us.
you sure you're not just jealous Bartowski's found himself a new piece of asset?
now where is that do of us?
guy loved the opera.
here's his family's box.
not bad.
you really feel like you're on top of the action.
how do you know what you're looking for?
Oh, well...
it'll match the end of this key.
you know, something...
something...
like this.
shall we see what we got?
bingo.
Hey, we got it!
Mr. Kolfi, we'll be out of your hair in a minute, okay?
I don't have a minute. We are trying to rehearse.
this is a quick, quick, quick minute.
you know, government stuff.
watch out.
Casey, that's a bomb.
all right, rehearsal's over. Everyone out of here!
come on, Chuck, let's go! We gotta go!
wait! This doesn't make any sense.
guy wanted to help people, not hurt them.
this isn't a bomb, this is a clue.
Jill, if it looks like a bomband it ticks like a bomb, then generally it's a bomb.
no, this is a puzzle we need to solve before the timer runs out.
and what if you're wrong?
that doesn't happen.
look, it's a music thing. What's the opera?
verdi's la traviata.
well, how does that go? You play violin, right?
your dad made you play the flute.
let's not bring that up.
come on.
get 'em all out! All of 'em!
go, go!
it's not happening. Let's go.
Chuck, come on!
look, Jill has yet to be wrong, okay?
she says it's not a bomb, I believe her.
it's a flash drive. This must be it.
that's how we do that, huh?
Jill, it was all you.
no, you. It was all you.
okay, all right, all right.
I love love.
the flash drive containing guy's list is encrypted using a 512-bit aes cipher.
right now, the computer istrying every possible key against the encrypted data.
when it finds a match, we'll have the identity of every fulcrum agent with whom Guy was in contact.
how long will that take?
could be hours, could be days.
excellent work, you two.
please thank the asset for his service.
where is Chuck right now?
my guess would be rounding second base.
you were brilliant tonight.
no, you.
Mm-mm, all you.
no, no, no, I can't do this.
you don't have to do a thing.
it's gonna be all me.
I...
mm, that's very gracious of you, but no, that's not what I'm saying.
I mean, I can't do this.
I can't, I can't do this.
Hey, come here. Come here.
look...
buy more. Tomorrow.
what time?
take the latent heat of aquatic fusion...
is that in calories per gram?
of course.
and then subtract the atomic number of thulium.
got it?
okay, I'll see you then.
nerd code.
Hey, hey, buddy, listen, I need you to cover for me with Emmett today.
gotta cut out early.
I see big night with the lady, huh?
actually, uh, yeah.
we're sneaking off for a little romantic get away.
Oh, how sweet.
so you and Sarah are taking a little trip together, huh?
Yeah, we're, uh...
just save it, Pinocchio.
I know you're seeing Jill.
you what? You...how?
how do you know about Jill?
apparently, I'm the last one to know, too.
Milbarge knows about it.
this is Jill.
I spent months helping you get over her.
look, Chuck, we're best friends, but if you're not telling me about this, what else aren't you telling me?
Morgan, I'm so sorry, buddy.
I really am.
and-and trust me, there is so muchthat I wish that I could tell you, but you know, I can't.
dude, you've never lied to me before.
exactly, so just trust my judgment on this, okay?
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.
can you cover me?
of course, I can cover for you, man, because we're best friends and that's what best friends do--they lie for each other.
but they don't lie to each other, that's all.
got it.
trust me. And thank you, thank you.
I'm gonna grab some turkey jerky inside.
do you want anything?
uh, a water and some gummi bears.
okay, coming right up.
have you heard from Chuck?
no. I'll do a GPS search on his watch.
little twerp's gone off grid.
Hey, no gummi bears, so I hope you like sour...
Chuck, help!
Jill! -That's close enough.
you have something that belongs to me.
what? No. This? No, no, no.
see, I paid--I paid for this.
but you can have it.
why don't you just let the girl go and then you can tell me what it is exactly that you've lost, then maybe I can help you find it?
bring me Lafleur's list or the girl dies.
opera house. Midnight.
they took her! The hell you been?
you deliberately went off grid.
some guy just took Jill!
he said if I didn't bring him guy's list off ulcrum agents, he's gonna kill her.
that's not gonna happen. Yeah, of course not.
I'm gonna bring him the list, and I'm gonna get her back!
no, you're not.
they'll kill her either way.
what? No. That can't happen.
please, casey, will you please help me?
no.
I gotta call Washinton and report it.
you stay right here.
don't move.
you've done enough damage already.
general, we have a situation.
stop!
Walker, shoot him!
Chuck, freeze!
don't.
if you try to take that, I have to stop you.
please, let me go!
this is treason, Bartowski.
please, just let me go.
shoot him, walker. Shoot him in the knee.
I'm sorry.
I have to.
it's Jill.
you could've shot him.
he's the intersect.
is that all he is?
you could've at least knee capped him.
I have a trace on chuck.
he's heading downtown.
you get the car, I'll get the guns.
can we dispense with the pillow talk and just do this?
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
let her go. -Not so fast.
you've seen mine, now show me yours.
that's fine, but first I need to know that she's gonna be safe.
that's not how this works.
you hand over the list, or I shoot you both.
that's not how this works either!
go wait in the car, Chuck.
don't move, Chuck.
stay right where you are.
I've got a sharp shooter trained on you.
now I have the sniper.
I still have the advantage.
somebody give me the list, or I shoot Chuck.
Yeah, go ahead and shoot him.
you know, I was thinking about shooting him myself.
that's a great--why would you-- what, what?
what are you, crazy?
how about nobody, how about nobody shoots Chuck?
I'm not Sarah, Chuck.
give him that list, and I will end your miserable existence.
it's your choice. Would you rather I shoot the girl?
please don't. I would rather you not shoot the girl
just point the gun back at me, please.
No!
no, go ahead, shoot the girl.
some situations, collateral damageis unavoidable.
no. It's always avoidable.
look, I have it, okay?
here it is. Right here, here's the list.
look, you gota better plan?
cause I'm not okay with collateral damage right now.
here you go.
here's your list of all the fulcrum agents.
well, Mr. Casey, fulcrum would rather you not know who we have inside government.
show must go on.
now, Sarah!
okay.
you're okay.You're okay...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
he is gone.
you okay?
I am now.
Ah, poker night.
and all I had to do was rat out my best friend.
I saw that, Grimes.
Oh, don't worry.
what's a card game without a couple of brewskis?
and by "couple,"do you mean 14?
Oh, god.
I won't forget the loyalty you showed, Grimes.
tonight, we drink.
tomorrow, Bartowski gets his.
whatever, dude.
beer?
Oh, no. I brought my own.
tastes like high school!
donkeys wild.
let's go-- who's gonna put the "poker" in "strip poker.＂
let's play it out, boys, let's play it out.
are you sure you're okay?
I think so.
is this a normal day at the office for you?
Yeah, except Casey doesn't usually sing.
okay, first I'm gonna have you arrested for crimes against your country.
then I'll take you down to Club Gitmo, hang you up by your finge nails with the boys...
I appreciate the threats, I really do.
but can I please explain myself?
explain what?
you gave away classified intel to the enemy.
now we're never gonna know the identities of those fulcrum agents.
ye of little faith.
Casey, come on, buddy.
do you really think that I would give that guy the list to destroy before I made myself a copy?
q-36 game copier.
thankfully, Morgan is too cheap and unethical to pay for his own video game entertainment.
canada's greatest gift since Shania Twain.
thank you for saving my life.
sorry for not trusting you with Chuck.
you want to pay me back?
don't hurt him again.
I won't.
I wouldn't.
I care about Chuck.
me, too.
it's my job to protect him.
from anything.
Hey, Emmett.
stop screaming.
little too much fun last night, huh, pal?
I should never have gone for that second fuzzy navel.
that wine cooler had four percent alcohol.
I know. I know.
I tell you what, though, let's talk about it, in my office.
Yeah, come on. This way.
you know, I wanted to talk to you today about a little technique that we developed around here.
it worked wonders during the Harry Tang years.
can we talk about this some other time, Grimes?
you see, buy Moriais a country governed by law.
but occasionally, avigilante hero has to rise and take that law into his own hands to protect the country that he loves.
this is from last night.
after poker.
I'm big mike!
what you doing here, emmett?
is that you in big Mike's office after hours?
that's weird, because I thought that was off-limits.
even to you.
I didn't go six years to community college to assistant manage a bunch of register jockeys!
Oh, man, you do not look good.
now, I know that we're...
country men and all.
I hate to have to run this up the flag pole.
you wouldn't. Damn right I would.
if you don't call off this witch hunt for Chuck Bartowski, this goes public.
do we understand each other?
good.
viva buy Moria.
tastes like high school.
okay, computer's back up.
it's decoding the list.
just a matter of time before we learn the identities of fulcrum's agents.
Hey, yeah, hey.
that's fine, I wasn't gonna pack that one anyway.
Oh, wait. Hey, no.
the hotel's booked, so...
we should probably go if we're gonna beat traffic!
or we could just get the weekend started right now.
uh, what about, what about the...
I have some spy moves of my own.
we're gonna do this again?
you know what?
he had a big day today. How about we give him a little break, huh?
encryption key's been found.
fulcrum safe at last.
please make sure your seatbelts are securely fastened.
I don't speak german. I'm from denver. I'm from denver.
my friend, it's just an electrical storm.
I understand.
here. Gum?
no, uh, thank you.
Oh, my god. - what?
this bed is loud. - You think?
we--we can't keep doing this.
sneaking around.
department's not a massive fan of office romance.
the policy seminar was endless, wasn't it?
I kept finding myself staring at you.
actually had to move my chair to stop.
well, I--I think charlie knows. - No, he doesn't know.
well, I think he does.
if he knew, you would be transferred.
the idea of somebody making a call whether or not you and I get to live in the same city, that's unacceptable to me.
anyway, that's all just preamble to the kicker, which is that...
I love you.
Yes, sir.
of course, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm on my way.
incident at Logan. International flight. Charlie's on his way.
agent Scott.
Logan AIRPORT BOSTON
we're gonna let the FBI take the lead.
Olivia Dunham, FBI.
we got a flight out of Hamburg. 147 passengers.
towers lost contact three hours in.
they thought it might have been electrical interference.
they entered our airspace radio silent.
navy then scrambles two F-18s for escort.
they reported stains on the windows.
no signs of life aboard the jet.
white house approved a CDC request for the jet not to be opened until they arrive.
no signs of life? Who was flying the plane?
Logan's one of the first airports with the pearl autopilot system.
plane landed itself right on time.
unlike every flight I've ever taken.
well, let me assure you we'd be happy to treat you asamily too.
good old NTSB. They all like to think they're cops.
agent Scott. - Agent Francis. Agent Dunham.
whatever the hell Mcneary saw through that window, it made him throw up in front of his whole unit.
excuse me.
so what's going on here? Some sort of accident?
tarmac's closed.
nothing you need to worry about, sir.
Oh, all right.
move along. - I'll do that.
Thanks.
although this is a joint task force, you're all reporting to the department of homeland security.
I'm special agent in charge Broyles.
d.c. has sent me here to make sure we get results.
standard level four hazmat suits are required to go in.
members from each agency on the starting line as follows.
CIA, Baronoff.
FBI, Charlie Francis and John Scott.
everyone else stand by.
okay, people, let's move.
sir!
Olivia Dunham, FBI interagency liaison.
liaison on an interagency task force. Gotta love that.
kind of like powdered sugar on a glazed donut.
excuse me, if I'm gonna do my job effectively, I like my information first-hand.
that's not redundancy. That's accountability.
I know exactly who you are.
you want in, liaison?
suit up.
what kind of terrorism is this?
who says it's terrorism?
sources tell us the plane was deliberately set ablaze by the CDC after all passengers' remains had been removed...
federal BUILDING BOSTON seat 41a, John Rosenbloom. Honolulu, Hawaii. Car salesman.
criminal history's negative.
have we reviewed video from the hamburg airport?
we need to see if any passengers...
on its way.
and what the hell is taking so long with that black box?
please tell me that terminal's shutdown.
it's been down since 0400 local. You got any more questions?
who's point from CDC on the bone tissue...
agent Paley. You want his home number?
no, but I'd like the whole report.
and not just this fax-- - we're on that too, liaison.
we don't think what happened on that plane was a result of the in-flight movie.
back bay PD got a call at 03:00 from a guard on duty at a storage facility.
he saw two, and I quote,"suspicious middle eastern men" handing a white guy a briefcase.
liaison, take it. Go find out.
take what? That?
you're telling me that's my assignment?
Yeah, honey. Would you mind?
in conjunction with the center for disease control, the decision was made to burn the plane only after it was determined
petty bastard.
he's pissed because his best friend sexually assaulted three marine privates, and I'm the bad guy 'cause I put him away.
Broyles is an idiot.
you're smarter, you're stronger, you're much better looking.
he's jealous.
what?
you said you loved me in the motel.
Yeah.
that was a big deal.
Yeah, well, you didn't say anything back, so I just let it go.
I've been sort of bad at this for a long time.
until you.
I wanted to say I love you too.
let's go check the trash together.
empty.
acetylene, propane?
no, ammonia.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? I'm a federal agent.
we need to get a chem transport team out here now.
I'm on it.
no signal.
Freeze! FBI!
I have a gun! I will shoot!
we got a runner in the back. We need him alive.
I'm on my way.
hands in the air! - John!
you were very lucky today, agent Dunham.
your wounds could've easily been much more severe.
agent Scott wasn't as fortunate.
while he survived the initial blast, agent Scott was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds.
work that was done in the labs you found.
he's not contagious, but until we understand more, it's better not to introduce any additional contaminants.
we haven't been able to identify the substance that's affecting him.
the CDC has sent in specialists, but, well, they've never seen anything like what's happening here.
we've put agent Scott in a drug-induced coma.
his body temperature has been lowered significantly to try and slow the progress.
I'm sorry, agent Dunham.
it's me.
liaison.
I found a connection between the hamburg flight and what's happened to agent Scott.
his name's Walter Bishop.
he's a scientific researcher from Cambridge.
born in '46, Harvard educated.
post grad at oxford and M.I.T.
look at the experiments he was doing in the '70s.
I believe Dr. Bishop might have information that might tell us what happened aboard that plane and save agent scott's life.
says the guy's been at st. Claire's for 17 years.
I saw that. An assistant was killed in his lab.
rumors about Dr. Bishop using humans as guinea pigs.
he was charged with manslaughter, but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.
why are you so sure Bishop's worth our time?
why are you so sure he's not?
listen, Dunham, you and I got off on the wrong foot.
if my past job performance as U. S. Marine special investigator offends you.
well, yeah, it does.
a man who serves his country for 30 years has a few drinks and a small lapse in judgment - does not deserve five years. - A small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young women for the rest of their lives.
but that's not tonight's business, is it?
look, D.C. has tasked me to make sure that our reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach.
now it says here, in 1991 the glorious state of Massachusetts forbade dr. Bishop from having any visitors with the exception of immediate family.
so from where I sit, barging into a mental institution waving the patriot act, which is what you'd need, and demanding face time with some old lab rat who you think might be behind some of the most terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine.
I'm coming to you with a solid lead. - And your personal resentment is preventing you-- - and you're wasting your breath and my time.
do you understand "immediate family?
you want to question dr. Bishop, you go find his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.
talk to bishop, uncover something substantial, and I will have your back.
until then, I am not so convinced.
now can you handle that?
he does have a son.
is his son local too?
not exactly.
BAGHADAD IRAQ so this guy's walter bishop's son.
his name's Peter Bishop.
he's a high school dropout, I.Q. At 190, which is 50 points north of genius.
misfit, nomad.
hasn't kept a job longer than two months.
he's been a wild land fireman, cargo pilot, and briefly a college chemistry professor.
he falsified a degree from M.I.T.
and even managed to get a few papers published before he was found out.
sounds like a massive pain in the ass.
my resume is hardly traditional.
but around these parts, traditional increasingly means irrelevant.
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure and you can barely keep the lights on.
so you need someone to oversee construction on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude between your fields in Kirkuk and the port of Ceyhan.
a job well outside the green zone, I might add while I'm still alive to do so.
you'll need someone who has a handle on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.
the heat exchange in oil mixture flows.
you'll also need someone who can work with mixed integer programs because you're gonna have to resize the pipes as you start working across uneven terrain.
that is, if you want to keep down construction costs.
I also speak Farsi.
and 600, 000 all in sounds fair.
Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.
okay.
you've heard of flight 627?
the Hamburg flight, of course.
you may be able to help us with that.
no, I think you got the wrong guy.
your father is Walter Bishop.
you know, the last time somebody asked me that it was an accusation.
well, he's the man we're looking to speak with, but due to his current status, you're the only one who can provide us access.
and what possible help could that man be to you?
and what is it exactly that you're expecting me to do?
hop on a plane with you back to Massachusetts?
I just got here, honey.
I can have you on a return flight here in four days, but first...
let me save you the time.
I'd rather stay here in Iraq.
that's how much I want to see my father.
I'm going to beg you as one human being to another.
your father may be able to save someone who's dying.
someone I care about very much.
sweetheart, we all care about someone who's dying.
I can't help you. I'm sorry.
I know why you're here!
I have your file.
what file?
the one the FBI would say doesn't exist.
and it has everything.
where you've been, what you're running from.
and what you need while you're here.
so either you come with me, or I let certain people know your whereabouts.
when do we leave?
did the doctors say anything else?
Yeah.
Thanks, Charlie.
let me ask you something.
my father, not my favorite.
he is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son of a bitch on the planet.
so he was a chemist.
that much I already know.
he worked out of a basement lab in harvard doing research for a toothpaste company.
I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night, that my father was arrested, beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home.
but here's the thing, Olivia.
my gut tells me that your friend's life, the one hanging in the balance, not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste.
he worked out of Harvard, but not on toothpaste.
he was part of a classified U. S.Army experimental program called Kelvin Genetics.
they gave him the resources to do whatever work he wanted, which was primarily in an area called fringe science.
when you say fringe science, you mean pseudoscience.
I suppose.
things like mind control, teleportation, astral projection, invisibility, genetic mutation, reanimation, fertility...
whoa, excuse for a sec.
Reanimation? Really?
so you're telling me what?
my father was dr. Frankenstein?
ESSEXCOUNTY MASSACHUSETTS
you know what?
why don't you go on ahead.
Dr. Bishop, special day. You have a visitor.
hello.
I knew someone would come... eventually.
Dr. Bishop.
Dr. Bishop?
and you said this was-- when did this happen?
the incident on the plane happened four days ago.
agent Scott was injured the next day.
the dermis already indurated, translucent.
M-muscular tissue visible.
on Scott, you mean, can you see through skin?
Yes.
Oh, that's not good.
to see through the skin, it's--it's tricky, it's advanced.
like that it's tricky. - What's happening to him?
can it be reversed?
what is it?
they... they have this horrible pudding here.
butterscotch pudding on mondays. It's dreadful.
it's thursday.
Oh, that's fantastic news.
it can be reversed.
what happened to your colleague.
years ago I worked with lab animals, and--and some of them were afflicted, but were saved.
so do you remember what to do?
this place, their- their choice of therapies has c--c
Dr. Bishop.
you came here today with my son.
I'm not allowed visitors, you see, except immediate family.
and unless the order has been lifted, then it's a simple if/then formula.
if you are here, then so is he.
I would... so much...
so very much like to see him.
so much.
he asked for you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
I really appreciate that.
Hey, I didn't tell him you were here.
and call me "sweetheart" one more time. I'd really like that.
Hello, Walter.
I thought you'd be fatter.
you thought I would be fatter.
excellent first words, perfect.
no, as a boy, you were rounder.
Yes, I was until the summer before high school.
not that I'd expect you to remember that.
may I see something?
what are you doing? Take your hands off of me!
pupils are good. They're good. Thank goodness.
how advanced is your colleague's condition?
which--which is something I-I-I
I'm unable to deduce without a firsthand examination.
I must see Mr. Scott myself.
which I am unable to do.
well, under present law.
Unless--unless signed out by a legal guardian who must be, once again, a relative.
what are you asking me to
no. Guardian? No, forget it.
he'll do it. - No, I will not.
one phone call. That's all it takes. You want me to make it?
cause I got my phone in my pocket.
now it's out of my pocket.
you wanted my father.
now you've got my father.
which falls into the category of be careful what you wish for...
sweetheart.
every effort is being made to understand what happened on flight 627...
Dr. Bishop, I was curious.
did anyone else ever have access to your work?
well, the assistants had bits and pieces.
and god, I suppose.
I supposed the only one that really knew what I was doing was Belly.
who?
belly, William Bell. He and I shared the lab.
you shared your lab with the founder of Massive Dynamics?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is, Massive Dynamics.
Oh, nothing really. Just a tiny little company.
that's perfect.
one guys becomes one of the wealthiest men on the planet.
the other guy becomes an institutionalized psychopath.
what? What happened?
I just pissed myself.
excellent. - Just a squirt.
I just got your message. How's John?
worse.
cdc says the Hamburg flight was caused by a synthetic compound.
which is like saying rain is caused by a wet compound.
they've run some tests on John, but haven't come back with anything.
what about Bishop?
left to right, insane and irritating.
and also my only hope.
listen...
I need to question William Bell.
could you set that up for me?
massive Dynamics William Bell.
he and Bishop used to share a lab.
you're kidding.
Dr. Bishop?
is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale?
I haven't had some in a long time. I miss it.
can we please get some ginger ale for the doctor, agent Farnsworth.
sure.
whoa, stop right now! Stop!
does this not concern you?
let him go.
petri dish.
quick, please.
good.
I need to take this to my lab right away. - Your what?
kresge building basement, Harvard.
we should leave.
I have my sample.
your lab was shutdown after you left.
I'm sorry?
wake up. It's gone.
no.
no, no, no.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
Walter, there is no lab.
it's a perfect working-- - no!
damn you, damn you!
we need to get him back immediately.
liaison.
when did you get back? - I need your help.
I want you to know I've successfully had dr. Walter bishop released from st. Claire's, and he requires the use of his old laboratory.
I'm sorry, what?
kresge building. Harvard, basement.
the university's been using it for storage for the past 17 years.
it would be nice to think that your tenacity in this case is a byproduct of a remarkable and robust professionalism.
but I can't help but wonder if there wasn't something going on between you and agent Scott.
get the lab for Bishop.
so much.
so much happened here.
and so much is about to.
harvard UNIVERSITY
Dr. Bishop, I've ordered a standard forensics work package.
is there anything else you need?
um, optical coherence tomograph for flesh study.
2, 000 pounds of silicon.
at least five anonymous blood samples from volunteer donors.
microorganism detector.
nasa grade, of course. There's still NASA, yes?
Yes.
Oh, she's still here!
Oh, this tank was the best.
and a two-year-old bos taurus.
a what?
a cow.
he wants a cow.
purebred, not crossbred. This is important.
mature weight, 850 pounds.
internal fat average of 2. 37
is he joking?
genetically, humans and cows are separated by only a couple lines of DNA.
so it's an ethical test subject.
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?
no, actually.
I picked that up reading books.
you should try it sometime. It's fun.
get him the cow.
fantastic, thank you.
the only thing better than a cow is a human.
unless you need milk. Then you really need a cow.
coffee?
Thanks.
tell me.
what else did that file say about yours truly? How bad was it?
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
why don't you go ahead and liberate yourself, cause I'm here now, so I kind of feel like I deserve the truth, don't you?
there was no file.
I needed you back here.
so that was what? You were bluffing?
I-I was desperate.
you know, I'm usually pretty good at reading people.
that's sort of what I do.
Yeah, well, I could see you were in trouble. Anyone could see that.
so I could've stayed.
I could've stayed in Iraq.
you know, a car bomb went off this morning in Kirkuk.
you might just owe me a thank you.
Yeah, well, I owe a lot.
tsk, yeah, I figured. Mafia.
a guy named Big Eddie.
you owe money to a guy nicknamed Big Eddie?
no, I owe money to a guy named Big Eddie.
he had it legally changed.
and the thing is, I'm not even a gambler. I mean, I never was.
it just-- a couple years ago I went a bit crazy.
I thought you were a genius. You must've had a system.
of course there was a system.
the house was cheating.
but you try telling 'em that.
72 during Vietnam.
the D.O.D.'s biochem division had us working on a leprotic contagion for possible use against the vietcong.
it's possible that whatever affected that plane may have been derived from that work.
what about John?
what's infecting him is merely a chemical reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients, not the finished contagion.
which means we can synthesize a counteragent.
so you can help him. - don't do that.
don't give her false hope.
there's no false. It's not false. It's real.
I could help, yes.
if I had a precise inventory of what was in that storage facility when it detonated.
we don't have it.
it all went up, everything.
and the suspect who might have those answers got away, and John was the only one who saw his face.
so how long does he have left?
current rate of crystallization, cellular degradation
how long? - 24 hours.
his brain will no longer be able to oxygenate itself.
I'm so sorry...
that I can't offer you a less dangerous solution.
what do you mean?
didn't I mention it?
whatever you think you said, you didn't say.
the synaptic transfer system.
the shared dream state.
what do you mean shared dream state?
the human brain generates a quantifiable electric field.
I posited in 1976 that it is possible to synchronize the fields of two distinct minds to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state.
like a string between two tin cans.
you know what's great about that?
is that it's completely insane.
you're saying I can talk to John in a coma and he can tell me what the suspect looks like.
it's not an exact science. - It's not even science.
have you done this before?
I have used this technique to extract information from a corpse once.
you can do that if they haven't been dead for longer than six hours.
right, cause after six hours, that's when they're really dead.
you could access his memories.
assuming there's no brain damage.
of course you'd have to have an electromagnetic probe placed in the base of your skull whilst immersed without clothing in the old tank.
and you'd be heavily drugged.
what sort of drugs?
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin, lysergic acid diethylamide.
that last one is lSD, by the way. --Acid.
take at least a few hours.
I'd need your help to synthesize it if it's not too much trouble.
Yeah, sure, no problem. That sounds like fun.
the man who was just released from the mental institution, he wants to give you a drug overdose, then sick a metal rod into your head and put you naked into a rusty tank of water.
no, I don't want to.
no, I'd rather not. I'm just saying I can.
okay, Olivia, excuse me for sec.
now you're obviously under severe duress, and you haven't slept since Iraq, and the man you care about might die, but I'm telling you that man will kill you.
you don't understand the procedure.
John would do it for me.
set it up.
I'll get DHS authorization to bring John here.
this is unbelievable. This is insane! He is insane!
and you're insane for following him.
excellent.
let's make some LSD.
put him over here.
Salt'll make you float.
Charlie, did you get me in to see William Bell?
massive Dynamics isn't exactly being forthcoming or courteous.
and apparently, William Bell is out of the country for the next two weeks.
what's this?
a sweet little memo from their general counsel.
so Bell doesn't want to talk?
or he's just being the head of a $50 billion corporation.
Oh, screw this.
I want to drive a tank through William Bell's office and find out what he knows.
I know you do, but I'm here to tell you the bad news.
it's gonna be another 48 hours till we get a court order.
you should probably strip to your underwear.
hello.
what the hell was that?
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.
I need you to get to Bell.
if Walter fails, Bell could be the only one to save us.
Livvy, what's happening here?
you've cleared all this with Broyles?
somewhat.
somewhat doesn't sound good.
is that a cow?
Yeah, that's Gene.
Listen,Charlie, I-I need you to promise me you'll do whatever you can.
of course. You know that.
be careful.
my god.
now where was I?
could you tilt your head forward, please.
I still think that this is deeply irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.
this is an anesthetic.
I feel normal working.
Yeah, cause bootlegging smack in the basement is just the picture of normalcy.
I got you. I got you.
I hope your guy is worth it.
and this will rip open your consciousness.
listen, in case, you don't come back, I just wanted to say before we do this, how much I appreciate what you've done.
there are so many things you'll lose in a place like that.
you lose being trusted.
strange how important that is once it's gone.
if you want to watch, you can come closer.
do you work here?
Yeah, I'm Astrid Farnsworth, assistant to agent Dunham.
who?
Oh, yes. I'm Walter...
Yes, thank you.
don't mention it.
these are her brain rhythms.
more important than most people know regarding cerebral regional interaction.
critical.
and--and these are his.
as the drugs take effect, the probes will synchronize the electrical signals from both.
that's what the brain is, an electrical router.
should be able to be interpreted by the other.
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.
then when the rhythms are in synch, they should be in the same place, so to speak.
so what do we do now?
now we wait.
what was that?
hello. Hello!
I think I'm here. I think I'm here. I'm here.
that's my uncle's kayak.
John? Is that you?
what's happening? - She's fine.
she's all right? - She's fine.
you sure? - Look.
I was just thinking about you.
what was that?
Oh, nothing.
John... you were hurt.
I don't remember.
think.
the storage units.
I feel cold.
I need you to remember.
remember what?
what you saw.
I need you to show me his face.
Why?
so I can save you.
please try.
try and remember.
Yes, this is right. This is right.
we got a runner in the back. We need him alive.
I can't see his face.
her leg!
Oh, I saw him!
I saw John get hurt. I was there. I was there, I saw--I saw him.
what do you mean you saw him? Where?
I told you not to ask me that.
this is him. This is the suspect we're looking for. He looks like this. Send me the image. I'll put it through the database.
have you slept? You look like crap.
no primary matches for criminal record.
well, cross-check all state driver license files and send this image to all local hospitals.
agent Dunham, take a look at this.
Oh, my god. This is him.
he was a passenger on flight 627.
I don't-- I don't understand. - Wait, wait, wait.
he couldn't have been at the storage place.
Charlie, I saw him there. - Hold on, guys.
morgan Steig was passenger number 108.
his emergency contact, Richard Steig.
you're telling me he has a twin?
Yeah, no home address, only a history of employment.
what?
richard Steig's last employer.
I was hoping to speak with William Bell.
massive DYNAMIC NEW YORK
I'm Nina Sharp, executive director.
I only have a few minutes.
our primary suspect is a former employee of yours, Richard Steig, who may have used research from your company to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin.
we don't know why or for whom, but it appears he was willing to sacrifice his own brother.
whatever killed those people on that plane got onboard through his insulin pen.
so do you want to talk to me?
please assemble everything we have on Richard Steig for agent Dunham here.
I remember Richard Steig.
he worked in our weapons systems research lab.
he was caught three months ago trying to leave the premises with classified information.
he was terminated immediately.
we referred his name to the justice department.
we have done our due diligence, agent Dunham.
and if you choose to drag our company and dr. Bell's name into this matter, you will be hearing from our attorneys.
how long have you worked for dr. Bell?
16 years.
I owe Massive Dynamics my life, and that is not an exaggeration.
I s a runner most of my life.
in the 97 Boston marathon, I felt strangely tired.
one day at the office, dr. Bell noticed my discomfort and insisted I go for a cat scan.
cancer.
spread so severely I had to have my arm amputated that week.
that first scanner that found my cancer was built by this company.
the robotic assist tools there were used in my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards were developed and manufactured by Massive Dynamics.
and my replacement limb was designed by Bell himself.
everything we have on Richard Steig.
do you believe that Steig may be part of the pattern?
I'm sorry, part of the, part of the pattern?
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.
well, I'm cleared to know whatever you're cleared to know, Ms. Sharp.
apparently not.
but suffice to say that we've reached a point where science and technology have advanced at such an exponential rate for so long, it may be way beyond our ability to regulate and control them.
you should know what you're getting into, agent Dunham.
I would say this to my own daughter.
be careful.
and good luck.
keep the tree warm, Sandy! We're on our way to your house!
and this is a show for children?
Yeah, it's huge.
surprisingly profound for a narrative about a sponge.
crazy house.
I just landed at Logan. I'm on my way to you.
I think we've located our suspect.
hold on a second. You found the guy?
you found the guy from your dream.
I'm picking you both up.
I need your father there to question him, get whatever information he needs so he can make the cure for john.
and I need you there too in case your father's
say no more. We'll meet you out front.
stay eyes on south side.
red, stand by.
rooftop, confirm your position.
s BOSTON
got one coming out.
this way, ma'am.
clear! Clear! Clear!
in the back!
I'd like to... check your blood pressure.
why don't you check your own blood pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.
your skin tone suggests you might be suffering from arterial hypertension.
don't tell me what I'm suffering from.
and there are no visible signs of hypertension.
when this over, please don't send me back.
I don't want to go back.
look, Walter.
this experience...You woke me up again, and you can't put me back to sleep.
it was hardly my idea, any of it.
whatever punishment you think I deserve,
I swear I have already endured it.
17 years. Please...
son.
what?
he's in the alley!
can I get out of the car?
stay right there, Walter!
we've got some questions for you.
U.S.Code 1111.
the murder of 147 passengers.
U.S.Code 2332-A.
use of weapons of mass destruction.
U.S.Code 2332-B.
an act of terrorism transcending national borders.
U.S.Code 1132-A.
attempted murder of a federal agent.
you want immunity.
I want a detailed account of all the synthetic chemicals you had in that storage facility.
write them down.
and then we can talk about an agreement.
I... have nothing... to say.
Walter, stay here.
where are you？
the compound affecting agent Scott.
it's water soluble, right?
we might not know what it is, but we know what it does.
so if I wanted to, I could extract the contagious fluids from his body and that would allow me to slip it to you whenever I wanted to.
in your food.
a cup of coffee.
the toilet.
nobody would ever know how it happened.
the only problem is...
the woman who was just in here, that's her friend who's dying.
so I just don't have that kind of time.
No!
tell me the chemicals!
Hey, stop, stop! You can't! You can't do that.
no, you can't do that.
I want the names of the chemicals.
I'm gonna count to one.
one!
the active toxin was a magnesium based ethylene glycol.
no, I understand that, but you're not listening to me.
magnesium ethylene glycol with an organophosphate trig.
Walter, just stop for a second.
his blood won't be able to absorb it before the side-effects kill him.
so you're saying what?
we synthesize a calcium gluconate in a thiamine base?
Yes, exactly.
we can't. We'd need more of his blood. We have none.
that's not true
all agents are required to set up a backup blood supply in case we're wounded.
autologous transfusion. That's brilliant.
we can create the antidote and then just dissolve it into scott's stored blood.
if we transfuse him intravenously, his body won't be overwhelmed.
a+, boy. Well done. Let's begin.
so I got the lab.
Yeah, I know you did.
Thanks.
how's it goin' downstairs?
Bishop says it'll be a while, but that it's looking auspicious.
that was his word.
what?
you've done some solid work here.
locating Bishop. Getting him out. Finding a way to get him to work with you.
we're impressed.
who's "we"?
what happened on that plane might be part of something more dangerous than just simple terrorism.
simple terrorism?
in the past nine months, there have been three dozen authenticated incidents like the hamburg flight.
John thompson, normal kid, went missing back in '98, reappeared last month halfway around the world. Hadn't aged a day.
in the past few months, 46 other children who went missing that same year turn up.
same story.
local fisherman off the coast of Sri Lanka reports a low-flying plane emitting a high-pitch frequency that blows out all their windows.
an hour later, same spot, an 8. 7 sub-surface earthquake creates a tsunami that kills 83, 000 people.
so why are you telling me-- - this man.
a patient in lisbon who woke up after years in a coma began writing just numbers.
they turn out to be exact real-time coordinates of our carrier battle groups in the pacific.
intel that's classified above top-secret.
so how is that even possible?
come work for me, and I'll get you the clearance.
Oh, stop.
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.
you must not have heard me. I said stop.
they're calling these events "the pattern."
as if someone out there is experimenting, only the whole world is their lab.
you've seen it. Now you know.
I don't wanna know. I have a job.
this is a more important job.
anything, anybody you need, you can have.
I like the job I've got and the man I do it with, which you seem to have deduced on your own.
look around.
you see all these people going about their lives.
no idea what's happening around them, what they're in the middle of.
I just wanna go back to before.
Dunham. I don't think you can.
he's up. He's awake.
Olivia, Olivia, he's awake! He's conscious.
John, can you hear me, baby? Baby?
I had a dream about you.
uh, a change of clothes for agent Scott.
his vitals are surprisingly strong.
so, um, how long does he have to stay?
until the melanocytes in his skin have regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week.
he owes you his life.
we owe each other.
what room is Steig in?
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?
I gave you the names of all the synthetics I used in the compound.
don't worry, our immunity agreement holds.
but there's still a whole lot more we have to talk about.
like, why you killed your own brother?
and who you're selling your work to?
who says I was selling it?
I was threatened by a guy from your office.
you think I'm lying?
I swear to god.
I can prove it.
Where's the recording? - I buried it.
who is this?
we had an exchange agreement.
hmm, there have been other bidders.
today, the airplane was a demonstration.
you've drawn unwarranted attention.
something we can't afford to be connected with.
I'll make this simple. You're not selling to anyone else.
you do that, we will come after you.
I will come after you.
you're threatening me after seeing what I'm willing to do to my own brother?
well, let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too.
special agent Scott.
Yes, sir, go right ahead.
Charlie, I need two agents posted outside agent Scott's room now.
check on Steig.
I'm on it.
I'm five minutes away.
we need this place locked down!
this is Dunham, agent I. D.52776, in pursuit of blue suv heading south on fenway.
need immediate assist.
ask yourself why, why Broyles sent you to the storage facility.
why you?
Why? I don't understand.
who are you working for?
John, tell me.
tell me more, John.
I knew him just as long as you did.
I'm sorry.
job isn't what it was ten years ago.
we're supposed to protect a world where one breath of the wrong air can incinerate you from the inside out.
I mean, how do we protect people when corporations have higher security clearances than we do?
when we're not fully briefed on half the things that we're investigating?
you know, when the truth...
the truth is we're obsolete.
take me back to the lab.
can I talk to you please?
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.
though I'm sure you're anxious to get as far away from here as possible.
to Iraq or Afghanistan or countless other out of reach places, but I'm here to tell you that your father needs to stay.
which means that you need to too.
are you okay?
no, I-I-I-I know that you have countless reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you.
but, I mean, your father is a good man.
he's not the monster you think he is.
and you're good with him, despite what you think.
and you're the only one who speaks Walter.
we take him back to ST. Claire's and it's all over.
Where's John?
I can talk to the agency and get them to clear your gambling debts.
I can take care of my own debts, okay? What just happened? Where's John?
I'm not gonna use false threats with you anymore.
I don't need to.
the threats are real.
after you left, my father sat down and started talking to me and he was remarkably lucid.
he told me about the work. That he and William bell had done their experiments.
and that incident-- what happened on the plane is just the beginning, which makes every part of me feel like I gotta get the hell outta Boston.
are we leaving?
are we leaving?
how long has he been dead?
five hours.
question him.
and over here, we have witch's field, so named because back in the...
olden times, witches would gather here to party and drink potions and turn people into flying monkeys and such.
it says here it's because 156 women were burned at the stake on this spot during the eastwick witch trials.
on account of the parties and the flying monkeys.
where is the regular tour guide?
our regular tour guide has been suffering a little bit of memory loss...
I was attacked by ants. - And I'm filling in.
one thing i do know, in fact, is that tomorrow night is halloween, which is kind of like new year's eve here in eastwick.
it's a very big deal.
in fact, we have quite a unique ritual we use in order to celebrate that has to do with letting go of r'st yeas baggage and starting fresh.
you with the weird shorts.
are those coffins?
you bet your ass those are coffins.
would anyone like to guess what's inside them?
corpses? - Ew. No.
demons. Metaphorical demons.
we decorate our coffins the way you might decorate an easter egg, and then fill them with whatever has been haunting us this past year...
debts we've finally paid off, letters from old boyfriends, a leather vest that looked great in the shop but ultimately created a boob sweat that was totally not worth the hassle
anything that might symbolize a burden.
we throw 'em in the coffin, bring 'em to the giant witch, and tomorrow night, we light it all up and watch it all burn.
sounds le a party, right?
and here we have one of eastwick's newest and most prominent citizens, Mr. Darryl van horne.
you here for the tour, darryl?
cause it's 10 bucks without pie.
Oh, no. Don't mind me.
I'm just here to participate in the festivities.
although, I'm sure your pie would be delicious.
it's like you've stepped out of a 70s' porno and into my life.
bun, do you believe this guy?
you okay?
that poor woman looks as though she's developing heatstroke.
I'd take her home if I were you.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, don't forget to tip your tour guide.
that man.
what about him? What's wrong?
he scares me.
Why? - I-I don't know.
okay, let's everyone start heading back to the bus.
in the name of the father and of the son and the holy spirit.
Amen.
I-i-is this part of the show?
who wants pie?
what a weirdo.
leave her alone, you ninnies!
can't you see that she's just been to a funeral?
that's when he came walking through my door.
Hi, pretty girl.
how you feeling, superstar?
I think I have a tumor.
Really?
did I say "think"? I meant "hope."
I hope I have a tumor.
no hoping for tumors!
you had a bad week, that's all.
Oh, yeah, you think?
let's see.
I lost my job I lost will.
I ran a pastor out of town with my stupid front page story.
Oh, did you guys see his wife on the news this morning, begging for him to come home?
Yeah, I couldn't just stop at ruining my own life, could I? No.
I had to drag innocent people into the fray.
pastor dunn is not so innocent.
you did catch him in a whorehouse...with whores!
so big whoop. He loves whores.
I got fired for writing a false story about darryl.
I slept with another man while I was supposed to be on a date with will, and now he hates me, and he should!
because I suck!
I'm worse than the pastor whoremonger.
will is a great guy.
and he's smart...
and he's tall...
and he's handsome...
and he's sweet and he's sexy and he's kind and he's funny and he's generous and he's
where are you going with this?
and--and he has a big heart, so just apologize.
I have.
well, apologize again and again and again until he forgives you.
why is this so iortant to you?
because want you to be happy, and, uh...
I think that you guys can really work it out.
Yeah. Men don't hold grudges the way women do, especially if there's a chance they might get sex out of it.
I don't deserve to be forgiven.
Yes, you do.
Joanna, you deserve will.
just-- just give it another try.
I bet you he comes around.
and if he doesn't, I'll kick him in the taint.
okay, I'll try.
there you go! Good for you!
Yay!
maybe take a shower first.
okay.
on the count of three...
on the count of four.
aren't you lucky?
why haven't you called me back?
because I don't want to speak to you anymore.
how does dissing work in your country?
look... I know you're upset about your friend getting fired from the paper, but I swear, all the formation I gave her on darryl van horne was completely accurate.
except for the stuff that was wrong, which was all of it.
you're responsible for joanna getting fired.
he's lying! - You're lying!
see how this game can just go on and on and on?
look, um, penny-- - jamie, I can't see you anymore.
you ruined joanna's life, which is kind of like ruining my life.
and why would I continue to have sex with someone who ruined my life?
thanks for the memories.
and this is the broom you use to light the bonfire each year.
we're letting allan heinberg emcee the event tonight, since you're not quite up to speed.
do I like allan heinberg?
everyone likes allan heinberg.
gee, sure hope it wasn't allan's funeral I was at yesterday.
I may have amnesia, but I'm not an idiot.
what are you getting at?
you ad my mind, bun.
I-I guess I did.
it was a bit weird.
is that normal for you? Have you always had that ability?
honey, I'm still trying to figure out how much cheese I can eat.
how am I supposed to know whether or not I used to have psychic powers?
so you admit you have them.
I admit I had them yesterday, and that is all I know.
so when you had it yesterday, and you were inside my mind like that, did you by any chance see whose funeral it was?
your--your friend who was killed...
because of the statue.
which friend? Who? W-what statue?
Oh, my god. Oh!
well, that's all I know. I...
it's fuzzy. I-I-I'm sorry.
your friend... because of the statue.
Oh, my god. I have to go.
bun, I'll meet you right back here this afternoon, okay?
1899/12/31 0: 04: 00
Oh, that girl has too much energy.
Hi!
Hi. Wait. What are you doing here?
did clyde give you your job back?
no, no, no. He kicked me out and threatened to call security.
but until he realizes that I snuck in through a side door,
I'm gonna win will's heart.
how?
uh, I predict that there will be some begging involved and perhaps a lap dance.
Really?
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?
actually, I'm here to see you.
I have been thinking about things and you and things in-- in relation to you and
and how everythin went down with me and you and
joanna-- - I'm just so sorry.
I know you are, and, uh,
I forgive you.
you do?
Yeah. I thought about it, and I realized you must've been in a pretty...
emotional state to do what you did, and I've been there.
so does this mean that you'd consider giving me another chance?
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I...
I just-- - the truth is I've...
moved on. - Aw, snap.
moved on," like, how?
just... you know...
on.
like--like on to another person?
look at me.
you will tell me the truth.
is there another woman?
Yes. Well, at least I hope so.
who is she?
your friend...
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
I'm gonna...
I should get going. I-I'll see you later, joanna.
see? I told you not to trust those crazy bitches.
too soon.
uh, I don't--I n't like this seated pose.
why don't I just stand like the statue?
you know, I've often pictured you on top of me, but it was never quite like this.
I just saved your life. - Yeah, thanks.
I saved your life and changed the future.
come again?
you're not gonna die.
I'm not going to your funeral.
my vision is not gonna come true!
I-I finally did it.
I changed the course of fate!
screw you, destiny!
you're no match for roxie torcoletti!
excuse me.
what does chad have to do with any of this?
Mr. Van horne. Babe.
dude.
what happened?
what happened is that you bolted this statue to its base incorrectly, and your shoddy workmanship almost killed me, and so now...
I'm gonna fire you...
dude. - Darryl, wait.
I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to
I don't want to look on you for another second.
now get out... child.
Hey. You know, if the face is intact,
I could just move this to the eastwick inn.
good idea.
why did you tell me to go for will when you already knewhe had a thing for you?
who told you this? - Will told me this.
will told you about the kiss?
you kissed him?!
mm, no! just for, like, a second.
it was that night when everything went crazy because of the moon.
it was a crazy moon kiss.
it meant absolutely nothing, I swear!
and if it didn't mean anything, then why didn't you tell me about it?!
good question.
and not only did you not tell me about it, you weut of your way to convince me to humiliate myself in front of him, when you knew full well he would reject me!
no, I didn't think that he would reject you.
thout that if you guys got back together, that I wouldn't have to say anything because the point would be mute!
moot. - Didn't I say "moot"?
you said "mute."
you are this close to losing your jell-o privileges, mrs. Greenberg!
I just can't believe that you would do this to me, kat.
Oh, god. I am so sorry.
Joanna, I wish that I could undo the whole thing.
I mean, especially because I don't know why it happened the first place.
obviously, I have zero feelings for will.
I mean, yes, okay, he's cute. But the only person I care about here is you.
the last thing i would ever want to do is hurt you.
well, you have a weird way of not hurting me, kat.
Oh, I just-- I think that...
maybe we shouldn't talk for a while.
Hey.
your mom said I could come up.
you're still mad at me, aren't you?
why would I be mad at you?
because I said you were embarrassing and basically called you a loser.
itas a rhetorical question, mia.
I know why I'm mad at you.
well, I didn't mean it.
whatever.
it's not like I have any illusions about how most kids see me at school.
I just...didn't realize that you were one of 'em.
I'm not.
my mom just got me so worked up,
I wasn't thinking when I said that stuff.
usually, people are the most honest when they're not thinking about what they're about to say.
I know this because I'm a blurter. Like...
when I saw your feet, I noticed how much I liked your toe ring.
and if I wasn't mad at you, I probably would've mentioned it.
you just mentioned it.
my anger remains.
look, how can i make it up to you?
seriously, I'll do anything.
what are you doing tonight for halloween?
Oh, hey. I'm so glad you called.
wha-- what the hell were you thinking, telling joanna about us?
nice to see you, too.
and I shouldn't even use the word "us" because there is no "us.
real? Cause I thought I felt a spark between us that night.
no, you didn' t. You know why?
because i am not the type of person to betray a girlfriend like that.
there is a code, will-- chicks before sticks.
I thought it was "bros before hos.
the point is I hurt joanna.
and the only thing I care about is fixing that and making things right between us.
look, I could understandf joanna and I had been a couple, but we never even went on a date.
and the one date we were supposed to go on, she stood me up to sleep with another guy.
irrelevant.
fine.
but if tre wereno joanna?
then I would still be a married woman.
I thought you were separated from your husband.
we happen to be bird nesting.
What-nesting?
it's a complicated living arrangement designed to decrease stress in the lives of my five children.
and I don't like you, okay? So just deal with it.
excuse me.
please don't make me get up.
go away, kat! I don't want to talk to you!
when a person doesn't return your messages it doesn't mean they want you to show up at their door.
pastor dunn?
so where are we going?
the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
I knew.
yet I entered into temptation.
but you've released me, miss frankel...
from my hypocrisy, from the burden of my position in this town.
and now to tha you, I will release you.
Oh, great. You can just drop me here.
I will release you from your spiritual burden.
that's cool. You--you don't have to.
I will take vengeance and will not meet thee as a man.
you know, pastor dunn, your wife has been very worried about you.
she's been--she's be looking for you.
maybe we should call your family.
pastor dunn, look into my eyes.
you will do what I say.
thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live"!
penny, right?
backstabbing slut bag, right?
Oh, I see that joanna told you about will.
Yes. Joanna tells me everything.
you know why? Cause we're best friends.
remember those lockets that we all had when we were kids, and one person would get the "be/fri" and the other person the "st/ends"?
she's my "friends."
which is why I came here, actually.
um, I know that you love joanna just as much as I do.
more. More than you do.
friends. - Good.
um, would you mind calling her just to make sure that she's okay?
I keep calling her, but she won't pick up, and she's not returning my messages.
Yeah. Sure. I mean, she always answers when I call her, but, of course, that is what you do for your "be/fri.
I'm just worried about her.
you know, she's been depressed lately, and I'm just afraid that this thing might push her over the edge.
feeling guilty, are we?
you've reached joanna frankel. Please leave a message.
she must have gone to theathroom.
wait. Where--where are you going?
something is wrong.
I can feel it.
wait.
I really used to wear this thing?
Yep. Every year.
tell me the truth. Am I stupid?
you're awfully cheery.
thanks to you, I saved a man's life today, actually changed the future.
it feels pretty damn good.
Hey, sweetie. How was your day?
remember when I told you I liked josh, then you told me I should talk to josh, and everything would be fine?
okay.
Yeah, remind me never to lisn to you again.
if you'll excuse me, I have to prepare for my social exile.
gotta love kids.
what the hell was that this morning?
bun, you remember chad.
whatever happened to standing by your man?
I don't know. Are we suddenly in a country/western song?
how could you just do nothing while that jerk ripped me a new one?
I tried. - No, you didn't.
I'm gonna go and pee.
what do you want me to say?
that statue almost killed him.
Darryl had a right to be upset.
you know, I don't even care that he fired me.
he is a jerk, and I was getting pretty sick of listening to you two banter every day anyway.
excuse me? We don't banter.
you banter and
and you flirt and you razz each other and you flip your hair and you giggle and you wiggle your boobs at him.
okay, I'm not having this conversation again.
are you gonna pick me up for the bonfire tonight or not?
I'll take that as a yes.
Hello?
maybe she went for a-a walk.
I'm calling the police.
Hi, I need to report a missing person.
now I'm not sure how long she's been gone for, but from the looks of the ice cream,
I'm guessing about an hour, maybe two.
so
are you kidding? That's a real thing?
they say that she has to have been missing for 24 hours.
well, tell them that she's been missing for 24 hours.
but I just told them about the ice cream.
I blew it.
look, is there any way you could make an exception just this one time?
cause I actually think it's a pretty serio
no? Okay. That's fine.
thank you. You suck.
we have to go to roxie.
what's roxie gonna do?
I don't know, but I'm sure she can help us.
I seriously doubt that. I mean, no offense, but she's never struck me as the brain trust inour little trifecta.
so I think I'll find joanna on my own.
suit yourself.
that's quite a power drill you got there.
I've always wondered what people use those for.
drilling anything interesting?
s-so this is where you've been staying, huh?
it's very cozy.
I saw a pottery barn catalog with a very similar feel.
maybe I should use my amnesia as an opportunity to start a new, cooler life.
you look great. Let's go to the party.
Oh, Thank god. You're here.
what's going on?
I think that something bad happened to joanna, possibly really bad, and
and I need you to have one of your vision thingies so we can find her.
I thought you didn't believe in my vision thingies.
I am willing to suspend my disbelief right now, because I'm desperate.
so come on. Go into a trance and figure out where s is.
it doesn't work like that. The visions just come to me.
I can't control them.
well, then what good are you?
don't yell at me. - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
I just feel like something terrible is going to happen, and joanna already hates me because I kissed will.
you kissed will?
and maybe--maybe I'm just being paranoid because I'm feeling guilty, but I don't want not do something just to prove that I don't feel guilty, because I actually do feel guilty.
but even if I didn't, I would still say we have to do something.
so let's call the police. - I already did!
you think at iould choose psychic vision over cops?
are you always this bitchy when you're freaking out?
sometimes.
what? What is it?
the keys burned my hand.
Joanna's keys?
they feel fine to me.
they're on fire!
bun, what are you talking about?
she's having a vision.
she's psychic like me, remember?
well, then why would joanna's keys be on fire?
the bonfire. - The bonfire.
let's go. - Oh, no. I don't feel well.
okay, bun, you wait here. We'll come back and get you later.
come on, roxie. Let's go.
um, excuse me.
have you guys seen this girl
Joanna frankel? She's missing.
Damn! She's hot.
I would definitely tap that.
please. Like you've ever tapped anything but yourself, lover boy.
excuse me. Have you seen
Oh, it's you.
would you like to sit down?
only because my feet hurt, not because I like you.
what's going on?
Joanna's disappeared, and I don't know what's happened, but it can't be good.
I mean, maybe she threw herself off a cliff.
are there many cliffs in eastwick?
there are roofs.
and she's been really depressed lately, and it's because of me.
I mean, I ruined her life.
I thought I ruined her life.
I know that I dumped a lot on yhe other night but the truth is, it's my fault that she got fired.
I should have checked out your story more thoroughly before I just threw it in her lap.
I am the fact checker, after all. It's just...
you confuse me with your musky man smell and your accent that makes me want to throw you down on a bed and eat you like a crumpet.
and I don't even know what a crumpet is.
I-I-I could help you find her, if you like.
don't worry about it.
I should get going.
you still don't trust me, do you?
I don't know you. That's all.
hello.
what's going on?
well, I thought we should have a talk.
what did you wanna talk about? - You seem nervous.
are you nervous about something?
I don't know.
you shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't be where?
in eastwick? In this house?
anywhere. You shouldn't be
you remember everything, don't you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
no, I think you do.
Oh, well, don't you look adorable?
are you going trick-or-treating?
how'd you get in here, mr. Van horne.
well, bun let me in.
I came here to take your mother to the bonfire.
but it looks as though she left without me, so
I guess I'll just see her there.
good-bye, bun.
I'll talk to you later.
I'm going to meet a friend at witch's field.
take me with you.
Yeah. Sure.
help!
you know, let's go find my mom, so you can hang with her, okay?
you know, it's funny that you're embarrassed to be seen with me.
you actually did it. You wore the costume.
well, you told me to, didn't you?
Yeah, but I didn't think you'd really do it.
so I take it we're not going trick-or-treating then?
would you have gone trick-or-treating just to make it up to me?
Josh, look at me.
I mean, this is what I'm wling to do, just to make it up to you.
that is awesome.
no, it's sad, but that is how much I like you, a very sad amount.
so am I forgiven? - I don't know.
you didn't get the little red circles r youcheeks quite right.
okay. You're forgiven.
good. - Will you just kiss already?
somebody help me! Help!
this is ridiculous. How are we ever gonna find her?
is that pastor dunn?
I thought he disappeared.
Yeah,'cau joanna wrote the article that ruined his life.
pastor dunn!
pastor dunn!
pastor dunn!
um, we're looking for joanna.
Joanna frankel--do you have any idea where she might be?
Hello?
we're talking to you. Freak show.
you're too late.
what?
Oh, my god. - Oh, my god what?
bun said my friend would die because of the statue. That's the statue.
the funeral was for joanna, not darryl.
what are you talking about?
Joanna's inside one of these coffins.
he's going to burn her alive.
pastor dunn?
okay I-I need to go figure out which coffin joanna's in.
maybe I can get her out of there.
no, kat. It's too dangerous.
do not go anywhere near the fire.
look, there's sheriff teaser over there.
go talk to him before the pastor gets away.
I'll take care of the fire.
Kat. - Okay.
okay.
you need to put out the fire!
what? The fire! Put out the fire!
no, it okay, lady. It's safe.
Bue'thers someone inside the fire!
you have a flat tire?
what are you doing?
I have to save joanna.
she's inside, and I have to get her out.
calm down. You can't walk throughirE.
no. It's gonna be too late.
no, let me go!
No!
let me go!
I am not gonna lou hurt yourself.
no, I have to get in there!
God! Joanna!
I have to get in there! God! Joanna!
I have to save her!
I can't just let her die, will!
Hi.
but I don't want to go to the hospital.
it's just for observation, sweetie.
they have pretty good brownies on tuesdays.
well, I'm fine. Really.
you are going to the hospital, and that's final.
probably a good idea.
thank you, will, for helping get me out.
don't thank me.
Kat's the one who tried to walk through fire to get to you.
you tried to walk through fire?
I've never really had girlfriends before.
I'm still figuring out boundaries.
um, is it okay if I hang out with josh a little longer?
sure, honey. Just be home by midnight.
wait. Josh, have you talked to chad?
we were supposed to meet up, and then things got all crazy.
uh, no. But if I see him, I'll let him know you're looking for him.
Thanks.
I'm so glad you're okay, sweetie.
Oh, anedi talk to sheriff teaser.
he says he's definitely on the lookout for pastor dunn, but he still may have some questions for you.
I can't beeve he's still out there.
they won't let him get too far. They'll find him.
don't worry, okay?
okay.
you ready, bun? If that's okay with you.
get some rest.
I am really sorry about our fight.
I'm sorry about everything.
well, you hurt me, kat. You did, a lot.
but you know what?
when I was stuck in that box, I had some time to think about some things.
will alhas ways been this...
like, shining, golden possibility.
but he doesn't really know me, and I don't really know him.
and he certainly doesn't love me.
you, on the other hand...
you walked through fire for me.
if that's not love, I don't knowhat is.
I'm really lucky to have a friend like you.
Oh! If my life was a doughnut, kat, you would be theamy filling.
you know, if it was a pizza, you'd be the cheese.
if it was a roast beef sandw you'd be
you're really hungry, aren't you?
so hungry.
but I do forgive you.
and more than that, I love you, and I'm so sorry that I called you a copper-headed beeyotch.
no, you didn't. - Yeah, I did.
I did, to roxie and penny an D...
the guy at therocery store. - I forgive you.
I guess I got really lucky it started raining when it did, huh?
Yeah.
I guess you did.
Oh! God.
you know, if you're thinking tonight is a good night for a booty call, you are more twisted than I thought.
haven't you heard? They found your friend.
what do you mean, found her? Found her where?
the whole town's talking about it.
she was inside one of the coffins at the bonfire.
pastor dunn was trying to kill her.
Oh, my god. Is she okay?
she's fine, apparently. They took her to the hospital.
well...
no, I-I'd be happy to drive you to the hospital if you like.
I don't geit. I mean, I'm kind of being a jerk to you.
why are you being so nice?
look, it's the least I can do.
you tried to help me, and I appreciate that, and I'd like to win your trust back.
Why?
well, for one thing, because I like you, and your accent makes me want to throw yown on the bed and devour you like a blueberry scone.
I love scones.
and also because I need you.
Why?
look, I need to expose darryl van horne for the evil and deceitful man that he really is.
I still hope you can help me do that.
how do you know that he is just so evil?
because...
he killed my mother.
Oh.
it seems that I've missed the festivities.
well, that's what you get for showing up five hours late.
I was installing my statue at the eastwick inn.
it looks magnificent, by the way.
Plus, I was trying to make a grand entrance.
Hello, bun.
are you all right?
not really.
it was such a terrible night.
go to hell.
do you want to talk about it?
I can't right now. I've gotta get bun home.
but I'll call you later.
is it just me, or was this the longest day ever?
if I had known this morning that it was joanna I was supposed to be looking for, we could have prevented this whole nightmare.
Roxie-- - I know.
I'm not blaming myself or you, obviously.
I guess the lesson is, I need to figure out how to understand these visions more specifically if I'm gonna change the future.
you can't change the future.
there are things which have beeset in motionwhich cannot be undone.
we can't change destiny, no matter how hard we try.
son of a bitch.
the rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated.
I used to be anonymous, invisible to the opposite sex.
if Google Earth were a guy, he couldn't find me if I was dressed up as a 10-story building.
pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh? A high school girl feeling anonymous.
who am I? What does it all mean? Why am I here? Blah.
but don't worry, this isn't one of those tales.
though it sure started out that way.
and then it changed pretty quickly when I started lying about some very personal things.
so let the record show that I, Olive Penderghast, being of sound mind, and below-average breast size, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Starting now.
and what better way to share my private thoughts than to broadcast them on the Internet?
so here it is. Part one.
the shudder-inducing and cliched, however totally false account of how I lost my virginity to a guy at a community college.
let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story.
and this is my side, the right one.
george is not a sexy name.
george is what you name your tedd not the name you wanna scream out during climax.y bear...
and by that, I assume you mean?
the stable and self-perpetuating end stage in the evolution of a plant community.
right. - Why, what were you thinking?
the same. But I don't say it out loud lest someone get the wrong idea.
I think you know innuendo is attached to everything these days.
innuendo? What? Whatever do you mean?
rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books. They don't hit back.
also, hugs not drugs. Mess with the bull, get the horns.
and any other cliches you can come up with.
Bye, Mr. Griffith.
Bye.
watch your mouth. - Sorry.
Mr. Griffith is my favorite teacher.
although, after all the trouble I caused I don't know if I'm still his favorite student.
you know, these are bad for you.
it leads to unwanted pregnancy, all sorts of things.
mismatched tires on your vehicle, which is nonexistent.
and here is where the trouble began. The lie that started the whole thing.
please, please, I'm begging you. I will pay you. I'll pay you.
Rhi, I cannot go camping with you, okay?
I'm sorry, but I have a date.
okay? I told you. - With who?
you don't know him.
and neither do you, you selfish bitch.
Yes, I do. He goes to college with my brother.
okay. What's his name, then?
Rhiannon is what you'd call a strong personality.
she asked me to come camping with her family and I don't know why I didn't wanna go.
a little because I didn't feel like hanging out with her all weekend.
but mostly because her parents are the weirdest people I have ever met and I live in California.
I ate dinner at her house once and I swore, never again.
this is interesting. - Patchouli burger.
we grew it in our victory garden.
you want some dessert?
no, thank you. I'm trying to watch my figure.
well, I'm not.
so I lied and told her I couldn't go because I had a date with a friend of my brother's named George.
let's just face it, there is no such thing as a sexy George.
Yeah, well, mine is, so I think we should just put this conversation to bed.
fine, don't go camping with us. Just know I hate you, bitch.
go get your chocolate milk.
do you want one? - No.
and here's how I really spent the weekend.
friday afternoon to our daughter
that's the worst song ever.
Saturday morning saturday afternoon saturday night sunday morning sunday afternoon sunday late afternoon sunday night
but on Monday, when Rhi asked me how my weekend was...
he was charming, you know? He was a real gentleman.
and it feels like I got a love and I know that it's all mine.
okay, okay. Wait, wait. So are you going to see him again?
no. No, probably not. You know, it was just one of those weekends.
a whole weekend?
Yup.
wait a minute. You didn't have...? - What?
no. No, of course not.
you liar. You totally lost your V-card to him.
no, I didn't. - Yes, you did.
tell me everything. - Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.
the kind that does it, or the kind that does it and doesn't have the balls to tell her friend?
what? - I want every detail.
Rhi. - Now, bitch.
you know, you call me "bitch" a lot. Okay?
it's not a term of endearment. - I want every detail. Now, shitface.
you're not heading in the right direction.
tell me.
fine.
we did it.
Yes!
finally. Now you're a super slut like me.
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund motorboat you behind a Bed Bath & Beyond really makes you a super slut.
there were a lot of people walking past. Someone could've easily seen.
whatever. This isn't about me, this is about you.
What'd you let him do?
it was normal. You know? Nothing freaky.
I don't know why I did it.
I guess maybe it was because it was the first time I had sort of felt superior to Rhi.
but I just started piling on lie after lie.
it was like setting up Jenga.
do you know, like, Glade candles?
those kind, but they were, like, sexy Glade candles.
he was sweet. He was... - Of course.
what the hell are you looking at, Sister Christian?
just a couple of admitted whores.
Marianne Bryant is the secretary of the student council, chairman of the Orange Blossom dance committee and president of the Cross Your Heart Club, a club dedicated to shoving their beliefs down people's throats.
obviously they don't care.
last year's cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot.
give it up for your Blue Devils!
blue!
blue Devil!
Yeah.
Yeah!
how can we exhibit school pride when we're conveyed to others as Satan worshippers?
now, thankfully, we're the much less intimidating...
give it up for the Woodchucks!
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!
Woodchucks!
I liked Todd much better when he was topless.
Yeah, but even dressed as a woodchuck, I still fantasize about him.
Woodchucks.
now Marianne had a new cause celebre.
me.
which brings us to part two.
the accelerated velocity of terminological inexactitude.
which is really just my obnoxious way of saying that lies travel fast.
and, boy, did my terminological inexactitude accelerate with velocity.
did you hear about Olive?
no way.
she's not a virgin anymore? - I can't believe it.
olive lost her virginity. - Yeah.
maybe next time a certain somebody will be a little more careful what she says in the water closet.
Yeah, about that? It's... That's actually not what you think.
can I talk to you alone for a second?
you gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
Bye, Nina.
what you heard in the bathroom the other day wasn't true at all.
it's actually a funny story. - Olive. That's your name, right?
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.
we've had nine classes together since kindergarten.
ten, if you count Religion of Other Cultures, which you didn't because you refused to go.
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one that you have to answer to for your depraved behavior.
there's a higher power that will judge you for your indecency.
Tom Cruise?
I hope for your sake that God has a sense of humor.
Oh, I have 17 years' worth of anecdotal proof he does.
you've made your bed.
I just hope for your sake that you've cleaned the sheets.
did I just get saved? - I missed you.
Oh, you too.
so Marianne spread the rumor.
for the first time ever, my sexual exploits were the talk of the school.
Oh, you know what? I'm wrong. It was the second time.
the first time was back in 8th grade when all I wanted was a kiss from this guy I had always had a crush on.
Todd and I were thrown together in Seven Minutes of Heaven.
luckily we had a super romantic song from our youth to set the mood.
I think this is the part where you're supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth.
that's what I've heard, anyway.
just give me a second, okay?
according to my watch, you have 382 of them.
how do you do that? - What?
add so fast. And you also talk like a grown-up.
don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart as I think I am.
so if we didn't do anything, could you still tell people we kissed?
Absolutely.
Thanks, Olive. - Sure, Todd.
I actually didn't wanna lie that time.
when people thought I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.
but when they thought I slept with someone...
Hey, Olive. How's it going?
I'm swell, Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.
thanks for asking.
all I could think to myself was, "Great, now I'm a tramp."
I'm gonna have to get a lower-back tattoo and pierce something not on my face.
you guys know that I was here all weekend, right?
Yeah. - Yes, you were upstairs.
Yeah. - You would testify to that?
Yeah. - I would take a bullet for you.
you know that. Right between the eyes.
man, I would slit my throat rather than say something to someone that you didn't want me to say. - That's not necessary.
but that is comforting. - That's how I am, how I roll.
that's how I do, as they say.
I like the pants. - Thank you. They're Costco.
you can have them when you get taller.
I'm never gonna go through puberty. - Course you will.
but we're a family of late bloomers.
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.
why does that matter? I'm adopted.
what? Oh, my God. Who told you?
guys, we were gonna do this at the right time.
listen to me.
sometimes, even when a man and a woman love each other very much like your mother and I used to their insides just don't cooperate with each other.
so, what's going on, honey?
why do you want us to take a bullet if anyone asks if you were here?
it's nothing. It's just the rumor mill.
what's the rumor mill churning out these days? Anything interesting?
you know, not really. Not really. It's a little low on grist.
clever wordplay. I like it. You must be related to me.
only by marriage. - Give it to me.
so, what we're all gonna take away from this:
I was here all weekend, right? - Yes, yes, yes.
remember how I told you Google Earth couldn't find me if I was dressed up as a ten-story building?
well, the next day it could find me if I was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.
that's the beauty of being a girl in high school.
people hear you had sex once and, bam, you're a bimbo.
I really didn't mean for the lie to put me on the map but I gotta admit, I kind of liked being on the map.
so, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne is a complex writer.
even I had trouble with him.
I read him originally when I was 5, but I struggled.
so I'm gonna break it down for you. I'm gonna throw some rhymes.
Anson, drop me a beat.
what? - Give me a beat.
push it up.
Yeah, adultery, vengeance
crimes of passion
kill the beat. I'm not gonna rap for you.
it's pandering and it's been done before in every bad movie you've ever seen. Okay.
ironically, we were studying The Scarlet Letter.
now, isn't that always the way?
the books you read in class always have some strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is going on.
except for Huckleberry Finn. I don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy.
for those who haven't read The Scarlet Letter or for those who said you did but really didn't, here's all you need to know.
this girl, Hester Prynne, has an affair with a minister, is besmirched and made to wear a red A for "adulterer."
the town realizes she was too harshly judged and she's really a good person, and she dies a saint.
a whole bunch of other stuff happens too.
if you have a test on it, rent the movie, but make sure it's the original, not the Demi Moore version where she talks in a fake British accent and takes a lot of baths.
to say that one was freely adapted is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.
what we have to realize is that Hester lived in an entirely different time.
a time when the worst crime a woman could commit was in fact adultery.
Nina.
I think Hester Prynne was, excuse my language, a skank.
a skank? So you don't think she was a victim at all?
why should I? She brought it on herself.
perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.
perhaps you should get a wardrobe, you abominable twat.
not my best line, but it was provocative enough to land me in the principal's office.
seems as if someone's on a downward spiral.
seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her life.
I hope you at least had the good sense to use protection.
Why? Your parents didn't.
you're going to hell. - Just as long as you won't be there.
I can assure you I won't.
good.
I don't care who started it. Just work it out.
Penderghast.
so why am I just meeting you?
language like this would've warranted a visit years ago.
this is the first time I've done anything remotely misbehavioral.
this is foul.
I know. I am so... I'm really, really sorry.
sorry you said it or sorry you got caught?
sorry I said it, honestly.
and sorry I got caught a little bit too, but mostly just sorry I said it.
if you use a word like this again in my school, it'll be your last. Understand?
Yes, sir. Yes.
I mean, this isn't one of those progressive schools where teachers are called by their first names and students are partners in learning and there's a fundraising auction at the end of the year where the more creative parents put on musical skits about the community garden.
this is public school.
if I can keep the girls off the pole and the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.
now, if you're sent to me one more time you're gonna be out on your fantail. Now, am I making myself clear?
Yes, sir.
good. - I think so.
I mean, I got a little lost in the middle, but I found my way back.
detention after school tomorrow.
now, out.
even though it was my slutty alter ego that said a bad word in school, it was my ass that got in trouble which was a place my ass had never been before.
Hey, Olive.
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.
they put you in the gas chamber if you take your head off at Disney World.
I think they just fire you. You're thinking of Disneyland.
disney World is more liberal. - Oh, yeah.
I always forget Disney World went blue in the last election.
are you going to Melody Bostic's party?
I hadn't planned on it.
me neither. My cousin's getting married. It's a rehearsal dinner.
see you. Stay excellent.
you too.
what's up, kid? - Woodchuck.
please tell me the rumors are true.
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.
no, the one where you got suspended for calling Nina Howell a dick and punching her in the left tit.
I worry about the way information circulates at this school.
Rhi? I need to tell you something.
like the exact moment you turned into such a badass?
I think I'm in love with you. - Okay.
tell me you left a mark on that scrunched-up face of hers?
it's not true. - It wasn't the left tit?
it was the right one. I always pegged you for a southpaw.
can you listen to me for one second, please?
okay. It didn't happen.
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe with me, you little sex monkey.
I got sent to the principal today.
did you win a medal or something?
not exactly.
I used inappropriate language in English class.
although we're reading a book that I personally deem wildly inappropriate for our age group, so I actually felt it was quite apropos.
what did you say?
let's just say it was an inappropriate word.
well, what did it start with?
a snide comment from a snotty girl in my class.
no, I mean what letter did the word start with?
T. - Oh, T.
t? Let us think. T, T, T. - T. All right, T. Yeah, T.
guys. - Noun, adjective or verb?
noun. It's definitely slang. Think British.
Tallywhacker? Termagant?
you're just saying sounds. Those are sounds.
spell it with your peas. - Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.
I will take that challenge. - Do it.
I like that. All right.
so does this have anything to do with the rumorthat you mentioned the other night?
do you need to talk to us about something, sweetie?
what's a twit?
that's an A, honey.
it'll get you sent to the principal's office.
sit down.
we're lucky that this is not a common occurrence.
what would my punishment have been otherwise?
bed without supper, I guess. - But I'm already finished.
no dating. No dating. - Yeah, no dating.
no dating for you, young lady. - No dating.
I think my complete lack of allure already kind of shot that horse in the face.
I wouldn't know how to be grounded more than you know how to ground.
that's right. Love you. Come here.
and I bet that girl was acting like exactly what you called her.
Oh, you have no idea.
I got a B-plus on my spelling test today.
that's good, honey, but everything has spell check these days, so just kidding.
where are you from originally?
so the next day I had detention which, thanks to recent budget cuts, meant cleaning.
I was looking forward to getting all this behind me.
I had done the crime. I was gonna do the time.
and that would be that, but that...
aren't there, like, child labor laws against this?
not in high school.
the principal's like the captain of the ship in international waters.
he can even marry people.
we haven't talked in a while. How have you been, Brandon?
fabulous. I'm crushing it. Everything according to plan.
I wanna be in detention.
Yeah, why are you here?
from the blood I saw gushing out of your nose, I thought you were bullied.
principal Gibbons is a homophobe, which is why I called him a fascist.
so the rumors are true.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I meant about Gibbons being a fascist.
so, what's with your new look? Very whore couture.
Oh, haven't you heard? I'm the new school slut.
you know, I did hear something. I also heard he was twice your age.
Oh, no, no, no. No, he was a freshman in college.
I also heard he gave you crabs.
people suck. - Tell me about it.
he's not real.
what? - The guy I slept with. I made him up.
wait, you started the rumor?
indirectly, I guess sort of.
or actually, no. No, not really. No, I didn't.
well, but you're perpetuating it. That's really messed up.
excuse me?
you're not even a real slut. You just want people to think you are.
it's pathetic.
no offense, but you could probably learn something from me, Brando.
are you saying that I should act straight so people will like me?
that's groundbreaking. You should teach a course at The Learning Annex.
it could be called "The Painfully Obvious with Olive Penderghast the Fake School Slut."
I was just suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers are onto something. You know, like Marianne Bryant.
maybe that whole stuck-up, Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?
no, I think she's just a stuck-up Jesus freak.
and there are some of us who are just trying to blend in to the crowd.
well, then you've gotta do everything you can to blend in or decide not to care.
I can't decide if you're a genius or a lunatic.
well, don't they sort of go hand in hand?
so you heard any word from George? - Nope.
I told you, that was a one-night stand, which is now over.
you're being pretty cavalier about this.
aren't you supposed to be eternally in love with him?
Yes, I believe so. If I was a Gossip Girl in Sweet Valley with traveling pants.
but no, I'm not. So I could really care less.
so Brandy Carter was telling Vanessa Hodges that you were with three guys in a Jacuzzi.
sounds like a lot of work.
I guess that's still better than getting it on with some old dude.
who said that?
do you know that Brandon kid? That's what somebody told him.
isn't he a homo?
Yeah.
speak of the devil. Hello.
I was just talking about you with my friend, Rhiannon.
you know Rhiannon. She's perpetually angry.
she curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...
Yeah. That's the one. - "Bi-"? "Bi-"? What's "bi-"?
okay. - I wanna know what "bi-" is.
Hello, what's "bi-"? What is "bi-"?
Bye. - "Bi-"? What is "bi-"?
bedazzling personality? Beautiful, beautiful soul?
big tits. - That's my identifier?
Yes!
all right, well, that was Brandon. He needs to talk to me about something.
probably wants to borrow an outfit. - Whatever, Big Tits.
heck, yeah!
big tits!
the next day, things took a turn for the scandalous which brings us to part three.
a lady's choice and a gentleman's agreement.
Hi. Is there an Olive here?
there's a whole jar of them in the fridge.
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong address.
just kidding. Come on in.
any friend of Olive's is a friend of our daughter's.
olive, sweetie.
there's a young man here to see you.
he said something about asking for your hand in marriage.
Oh, happy day, Mama!
Oh, I thought I was gonna have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness.
a gentleman caller, hurray!
what's that? - Olive has a boy in her room.
a boy? - A boy.
wow, a boy. - A boy.
a boy?
a boy.
welcome. This is where the magic happens.
and by magic I mean nothing.
do you wanna go out with me? - What?
well, I mean, like, do you wanna be my girlfriend?
Brandon, just a couple hours ago you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.
true, but you said I should pretend to be straight, so...
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.
I mean, you're a nice guy and all, but you're not really my type.
Yeah, you're not really my type either.
Yeah, I know that. I got that V where you'd rather see a P.
do you wanna have sex with me or not?
Oh, my God, dude.
you completely missed the point.
that's not what I was saying. - I know what you were saying.
I should act straight till I get out of this hellhole.
then I can be whoever I wanna be. I get that.
you know that I didn't have sex with a college guy, right?
I just told everybody I did.
actually, I told one person I did. And you know how these things work.
it's like wildfire.
so you're saying I shouldn't really have sex?
I should just say I had sex with someone. A girl.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, no.
Wai... Just... - Oh, no, no, no.
no way! No way! - Just wait. Wait, wait.
No! No, no... - Stop it, stop it.
absolutely not. - Think about it. Think about it.
we could help each other out. - No.
you wanna maintain this floozy facade.
I don't wanna get pushed into shit every day. It's a win-win-win.
how do you know I like being thought of as a floozy?
because at least you're being thought of.
just one good imaginary bonk.
you are on crack. All right? And not the good kind.
it doesn't have to be a bonk.
it could be an imaginary butterbean, lemon squeeze...
I don't know what any of that means. - That's because you're a virgin.
you know what? This is not the answer at all.
I'll pay you whatever you want. - I don't want your money, Brandon.
just do what I did and make someone up.
who's going to believe me?
you don't understand how hard it is, all right? I'm tormented.
and every day at school is like I'm being suffocated.
and sure, we can sit and fantasize all we want about how things are gonna be different one day but this is today and it sucks.
there's only one way around it. You were smart enough to think of it.
so please, just help me.
because I can't take another day of this. I don't know what I'll do.
I don't do anything half-assed. All right?
it'll have to be a public event.
melody Bostic is throwing a party tomorrow night.
all of your tormentors will be there.
you and I are going together. All right?
you have to do everything I say and tell everyone that I am sensational.
thank you so much for doing this. - Just you know, make sure you're ready to live with the consequences.
what the hell is a lemon squeeze? - It's like a backwards melon bag.
how don't I know any of this?
the next night was the party at Melody Bostic's house.
she is the most popular girl in school.
it's partly because she's pretty and has perfect hair but mostly because her parents let her have these parties every time she catches them doing it in the pool which is every week, apparently.
Brandon and I showed up when it was in full swing.
I borrowed a dress from my mom, Brandon borrowed a jacket from me and we put on a little show.
Hey, Olive and Brandon.
what's up?
I hope you don't mind, but we had a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails like, before the cocktail party with cocktails.
listen, here's the sitch, Melody Bostic.
Brandon was just in the middle of telling me this really funny thing which is really funny.
and I was wondering if there's, like, a room where we could go where he could finish telling me that thing that's funny if you know what I mean.
you can use my room.
down the hall to the left.
cool.
is that Olive with Brandon?
I know. What the hell, right?
you guys are my buddies.
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?
I love your room!
my sheets. Put a towel down.
olive's gonna do a gay dude. - Thanks. Close the shades.
what are you doing? - Relax.
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you really that repulsed by lady parts?
what do you think I have down there, a gnome?
so nice. What is that, lavender? It's pretty.
what are you doing? Can you...? Can you come here, please?
jacket off. Come on.
all right. Come on. Chop-chop. All right.
now grunt. Grunt and make it convincing.
I said grunt, not whine. Just grunt.
moan, you know? Like, sex noises.
God, you are pathetic.
good. Good.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.
you don't have to be so aggressive. - You don't like that?
no, I don't like that. - You don't like that?
how about that?
little better. - Yeah, you like that.
I like that.
this guy, he's gay, no? - I think he's gay.
don't stop! - Keep going.
don't stop. - I'm not gonna stop.
I'm not gonna stop.
now you try. You try.
I'm gonna turn you around and take you from the back.
that's not gonna make people think you're straight.
never mind that gayness because I'm a straight guy. Roar!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
that's awesome! That's perfect! - Yeah!
that's what I'm talking about!
do you smell that? Do you smell us?
did he just say it smelled?
isn't it supposed to smell?
you're not supposed to comment on it.
it doesn't really smell that bad. - Oh, yeah. Yes, God!
don't stop. Yeah! - Don't stop. It's too much fun.
you ready for the grand finale? - Yeah. What?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
come on.
Oh, my God.
go forth, my son. You're a man now.
Hey.
thank you.
seriously, thanks.
here. - What is this?
evidence.
what's up?
Hey, man.
how was she?
well, well, let's just say I'll be walking funny tomorrow.
what?
I'm drunk. What's up, bitches? - Yeah!
whoa, hey. - Todd, hi.
I thought you were at your cousin's rehearsal dinner.
it was a quick rehearsal. I only had one line.
that was a joke.
I know.
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?
you know, I'm...
I'm here. - Can I get you a beer?
that rhymed. I liked it.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go. - You sure?
Yeah. Bye. - See you at the salt mines.
maybe this is gonna sound stupid and, believe me, it's not like I was expecting, you know, fireworks or a string quartet or anything but I always thought pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more I don't know, special?
Judy Blume should've prepared me for that.
that is so beautiful.
never had one lesson.
that boy from yesterday just dropped this off for you.
well, put it in the pile of gifts from my other suitors.
Thanks. - He seems like a nice kid.
he seemed a little incredibly gay.
a dyed-in-the-wool homosexual, that boy is.
I just want you to know your father and I are totally supportive.
we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite-sex sex partner.
we're not dating, Mom.
and don't worry about not making us grandparents although we were kind of hoping you'd get knocked up so we'd have a second shot at raising kids.
really do it right this time.
bye now. - I dated a homosexual once.
for a long time, actually. A long time.
dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did not marry and have children with him.
no.
no, no, no.
your father is as straight as they come.
a little too straight, if you know what I mean.
I don't. Can you shut the door, please?
okay, door's right over there. Keep going.
take it down. - Go take that out to Dad. Nice.
just in case you don't shop at Target. Then you can go screw yourself.
Brandon.
Hi, Rhi.
is it true you got with Brandon at Melody Dipshit's party?
is that what people are saying happened?
that's what everyone is saying happened.
well, then I guess that... I guess that's true.
just because you lost your virginity doesn't mean you can go throwing your cat at everybody. - I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.
do you know how embarrassing that is?
finding out you slept with some gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?
must've been embarrassing.
why didn't you tell me you were going?
I would've come with and held your hair.
are you really making this about you right now?
you're starting to get a reputation. - You're coming off as a little pious.
you're pissing me off more than usual.
I think it's a best friend's duty to let her know that everyone, and I do mean everyone, is calling her a dirty skank.
well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?
you know, I didn't wanna believe it, but I guess it's true.
that is your identifier.
and you're a jealous virgin.
so...
people thought I was a dirty skank?
fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank they'd ever seen.
shit.
is everything all right? It sounds like you're having sex in here which can't be true, due to the fact that you have a homosexual boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend.
Hey, no judgment. All God's children. It's fine.
I was gay once for a while.
no big deal. We all do it. It's okay.
dad, can you just shut the door, please?
you all right, buddy?
Yeah.
give them hell.
Hey, Anson. - Hey.
I just realized the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for "I love."
what's a...? What's an anagram?
look it up, big boy.
what's your problem?
you wanna know what my problem is?
no. That was a rhetorical question. I don't wanna know anything from you.
we are not friends anymore.
we are officially over.
Oh, rats.
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was too loose around your chest anyway.
burn.
stop. - What?
what are you doing?
nothing.
don't forget, tomorrow's Earth Day.
guys, we have a problem: Olive Penderghast.
we need to pray for her. - Amen.
but we also need to get her the hell out of here.
Amen.
you heard what happened at Melody Bostic's.
I was there. I heard the whole thing. - That's not something you need to advertise, Kurt. - Sorry. But I was.
I tried to witness to her, but this girl is defiant to any type of help.
does anybody here think they can talk to her, get her to see what she's doing is wrong?
it's okay. - I'm sorry, you guys. This is so stupid.
no, it's not, Marianne. It's real.
it's real. - Yeah, it is.
Jesus tells us to love everyone.
I mean, even the whores and the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.
it's so hard because they keep doing it over and over again.
make me a promise.
make God a promise, right here and right now that we will remain pure and chaste until marriage.
we promise.
awesome, awesome, awesome.
I love you guys. God loves you guys. Now, let's change lives today.
moses - Micah? - Let's do it.
I didn't know what they were so upset about.
I put an A on my wardrobe just like they asked.
maybe it was because I was wearing clothes that were two sizes too small.
Hey, Olive!
you left your glass slipper at the party the other night.
Yeah, and I got pumpkin all over my dress too.
nice. Solid joke.
it sucks because we could've revisited Melody's bedroom.
Oh, my God, that was Melody Bostic's house.
Yeah. - I can't believe you remember that.
well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't remember their first almost-kiss?
Hey, Olive.
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?
can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, what's up?
don't get mad, but Brandon told me what you did for him.
Oh, well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me.
no, he told me the truth.
I was just hoping you could do the same for me?
goodbye, Evan.
wait, wait. I can pay you.
I am about six seconds away from slapping you so hard your teeth will bleed. - Can you do it in front of everyone?
I don't need your permission, you know.
what?
I mean, at the rate you're going I don't see how people won't believe it.
are you threatening me? - I'll give you 100 bucks.
you are repugnant.
that's the problem.
never mind.
I'm sorry I asked.
I knew it wouldn't work.
I'm just a fat piece of shit.
when will high school end already?
shit.
I want a $100 gift card deposited into my locker by noon tomorrow.
preferably to the Gap, but I will also take Amazon. com or OfficeMax.
actually, make it OfficeMax. I have my eye on a label maker.
we did not have sex, okay?
I let you fondle my chest, and it was a glorious moment for you unmatched by anything you've experienced, including cake.
got it?
wait a minute. A hundred bucks for second base?
Yeah. - Doesn't that seem a little steep?
can we throw in, like, some butt action or some pants rubbing?
what are you, 9? - Whatever. Are you in?
whatever. - Deal, then.
Thanks, Olive.
you know, the sad thing is, Evan if you'd been a gentleman and maybe asked me on a date I might've said yes.
Really? Do you wanna go out with me?
not now I don't, shit-dick.
it should come as no surprise that the rumor I was soliciting sex for money spread around the school faster than...Well, faster than the first rumor about me spread.
guys, come over here.
she'll do stuff for money. Around the world...
but for people who knew the truth, I was open for business.
and whether I liked it or not, I had a lot of customers.
Phil Lord gave me 100 bucks from Best Buy so he could tell people we hooked up behind the library.
I got $50 from T. J. Maxx so that Eric Ling could say we got it on during Chemistry.
ninety dollars from Panda Express so Ryan Dukes could tell people I showed him mine, but he did not show me his.
Chris Miller, big spender that he is gave me $40 worth of movie passes for my pretend cowbell.
they had an expiration date and were only good at the stupid foreign movie theater.
Hi. One for Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.
but even that is better than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent off to Bath & Body Works?
is that how much our imaginary tryst meant to you?
I fake rocked your world.
it's all I can afford. - How's that my problem, amigo?
I knew he wasn't Latino, but for some reason all these shady backdoor deals had me talking like Carlito.
beat it, ese. - Okay.
whatever happened to chivalry?
does it only exist in '80s movies?
I want John Cusack holding a boombox outside my window.
I wanna ride off on a lawn mower with Patrick Dempsey.
I want Jake from Sixteen Candles waiting outside the church for me.
I want Judd Nelson thrusting his fist into the air because he knows he got me.
just once, I want my life to be like an '80s movie.
preferably one with a really awesome musical number for no apparent reason.
but, no. No. John Hughes did not direct my life.
so instead of all that I get to save 15 cents on a bottle of Juniper Breeze Antibacterial Gel.
so if you're still with me, and I'm hoping that most of you are this brings us to part four.
how I, Olive Penderghast, went from assumed trollop to an actual home-wrecker.
you wanted to see me? - I did. Why don't you come in here?
what's going on?
I'm accessorizing. - Really?
I think you're taking your reading assignment a little bit too seriously.
well, I was really hoping to get an A. Get it?
I'm hearing some rumors.
well, those are true. I am considering becoming an existentialist.
you know what I'm talking about. - Jeez.
when did teachers become privy to idle adolescent gossip?
that would be when everyone is putting everything up on Facebook.
I don't know what your generation's fascination is with documenting your every thought but I can assure you they're not all diamonds.
Roman is having an okay day and bought a Coke Zero at the gas station.
raise the roof.
who gives a rat's ass?
he got a Coke Zero again?
that Roman. Incorrigible.
listen, whatever this little act is about, I just... I'm curious.
I really think you should consider giving me extra credit for going the extra mile.
I'm really attempting to understand this puritanical ostracism Hawthorne wrote about. - You are one of the few that read it.
if I read one more paper from one of your classmates who talks about how hot she is in the bathtub, her fake British accent or, is she still married to Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.
why don't people just watch the original movie like I did?
I know you read the book.
I did.
listen, I want to apologize for sending you to the principal's office.
truthfully, and I'll deny it if you say anything I wanted to be cheering with the rest of the students.
I don't know what it is about Nina.
I hate her.
I won't tell.
I'll deny it if you do. - Okay.
Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
stay golden.
Hi, Mrs. Griffith. - Hi, you. How are you?
a is for "awesome."
Yeah.
I've never seen that girl before.
that does not surprise me.
but I'm the guidance counselor. I should know all the students.
especially the ones who dress like prostitutes.
it's good to see you. - Hey. How are you? Good.
no, stop. We're at school. There are rules.
windows. - Yeah, yeah.
do me a favor, though. Just talk to her.
I think she's going through a phase.
that's not the girl everyone's talking about, is it?
it is.
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good. All right.
that snotty, Jesus-freak office aide I have has been bitching about her incessantly.
they're all lies, but she could use somebody to talk to anyway.
all right. Hey, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
you won't be there? - Sorry.
I have an after-school session. Kid brought a knife to school.
well, be careful, all right?
it was a butter knife. But you know what they say.
you know, it's a gateway knife, so...
all right, bye. - Yeah. Bye.
I'm thinking about another gateway. It's a...
making spaghetti.
that's great. - With meat.
enjoy eating your meat.
and balls. - Enjoy eating your balls.
sharpening your pencils?
getting them nice and sharp?
sharpening them up? Look at you. Look at you. So sharp.
sharpening those pencils. Sharp, sharp, sharp.
God, that's sharp. - Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?
good job.
well, the reason I called you in was just so we could sort of, you know, just chat about what's going on.
you know, there is concern from a few faculty members.
your husband.
olive, you're attempting to make a statement.
I'm just a little confused as to what exactly that is.
am I in trouble?
because, pursuant to the student code of conduct my hemline has never been higher than my fingertips.
no, you're not in trouble.
I wanted to make sure you knew if there's something that you wanna talk about you know, you can trust me.
if I open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence?
Yeah. I'm... See? I'm the guidance counselor.
that's what I do.
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.
don't you, though?
all right, listen, don't tell anyone I'm doing this, please.
here you go.
here you go. - I really don't need those.
Oh, you really do. Here you go.
here you go. Okay?
I just don't want this thing you're going through to define your life.
olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?
let your freak flag fly. Just make sure you have an exit strategy.
listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really... I don't need these.
the pill is not 100 percent effective.
ask some of your friends' parents.
thank you for coming in.
can you just send in the next person? Thank you.
you're up, hoss.
okay. Go. It's all right.
everything's gonna be okay.
don't you think it's a little strange that your boyfriend is 22 years old and still in high school? - Not that it's any of your business but he is here by choice.
it's his choice that he's a fourth-year senior that can't pass any test he takes at all?
his choice. His? His?
capital H?
if God wanted him to graduate, God would've given him the right answers.
I'm sorry. You gotta be shitting me, woman.
okay. So why was he blubbering like a baby?
is he struggling with his sexuality?
no, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.
his parents are going through a divorce.
okay.
you know, sometimes our boyfriend's parents they get divorced, you know?
and it's important to remember it's not your fault.
so I gotta go.
but they go to our church. What will people say?
how long do these embraces usually last? Because I gotta go, but I...
are you gonna be okay? - Yes, I'm gonna be okay.
Mrs. Griffith is amazing and she's gonna help Micah, and everything's gonna be okay.
see? All right, that's the spirit. Everything's gonna be okay.
okay.
wait. Why are you even being so nice to me?
I did it.
I got through to you.
I'm so sorry about everything I said. I am so, so sorry.
I mean, I really want us to be friends. Can we please be friends?
Absolutely.
and for a day, we were actually really good friends.
I was kind of starting to think things were gonna turn around.
olive!
friend. - Hey, friend.
I missed you. - Oh, I missed you more.
she texted me in first period.
msg
by second period, we apparently had private jokes.
olive. Olive.
tragedy struck in Wood Shop.
it wasn't because someone sawed off a thumb which has happened.
Micah is in the hospital. He is in so much pain.
the nurse didn't know what was wrong.
there, there.
it hurts so bad, Mommy.
well, it's just what I thought. Chlamydia.
no.
who have you been screwing? Tell me.
tell me now or I will kill you right here.
olive. Olive Penderghast!
olive. Olive Penderghast.
I have to call you back. Okay. Bye-bye.
goddamn it.
Chlamydia?!
that bitch!
olive? - Hey.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Goddamn it.
I panicked.
I said I got it from Olive Penderghast.
I know, but what was I supposed to say?
you know, and then my mom tells Marianne's mom.
I did. I tried to blame it on their divorce but my mom is not buying it.
that's it. I have to tell them.
no, I do not care that you gave me chlamydia. I don't!
I love you and I want to be with you, and nobody can stop us.
not my mother, not Marianne, and not even the school board or the president of the Americas!
Oh, God.
what? What do you want? What do you want?
just go.
perfect. Just perfect.
I'm sorry, I just... I was looking for Marianne.
did she say anything about being mad at me?
she just smacked the bejesus out of me.
no, that's my fault. I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.
but I messed up, okay? I just goddamn shit, goddamn messed up really goddamn shit bad.
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.
okay. Don't get me wrong because I love it., but I just, I don't think you're supposed to use that kind of language in front of a student.
you know what else you're not supposed to do, is sleep with them.
but that didn't stop me. Goddamn shit.
wait. You... Oh, my God.
but I'm not... I'm not judging you or anything, but, oh, my God.
I... Wait, what does that have to do with me?
you should know that my marriage is not great.
we haven't slept together in months.
in months, all right?
finally, this great-looking guy comes in and he's nice to me, you know?
and he's not a minor.
this is legal. It's legal because he's been here forever, okay?
he's not the sharpest Christian in the Bible, all right?
and then he finds out that he has chlamydia.
and so then he's telling everybody that it was you.
he didn't want me to lose my job and he doesn't wanna get in trouble either, so he said it's you.
I'm sorry.
but I'll... I'm gonna fix it, Olive. Okay? I'll tell everyone.
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me. Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.
and, you know, whatever else I lose, and then that's okay.
maybe it was becoming a habit of mine to help the downtrodden or maybe I just couldn't stand to see my favorite teacher's marriage crumble.
either way, I decided to help.
I could have chlamydia.
I mean, I could have easily given it to Micah.
I mean, who knows?
women oftentimes don't show symptoms.
and the whole world knows I've been whoring around.
no, you haven't. No, you haven't.
because a real whore can't admit it to herself, much less others. Trust me.
call Micah.
tell him he is an ass and he owes me so big for this, but also tell him I confessed to giving him chlamydia.
getting a lot of hugs today.
you're going to hell, Olive! - Get out of here!
I guess I shouldn't be too shocked these people wanted my diseased ass out of there.
save yourself, Olive.
the funny thing is, the whole time this all was going down I couldn't help but think I could've come up with better signs.
although you gotta love the Quiznos guy.
that's the one thing that trumps religion: Capitalism.
why are you doing this?
I'm trying to make this school a better place.
start a petition to get rid of the lead paint.
new Honey Chicken at Quiznos.
not now, Quiznos. - You're a slut.
you're going down, Olive.
if this is because I'm more popular than you, then I think what you're...
let's not mistake popularity for infamy.
you don't wanna burn, do you? - I'll be praying for you.
sorry.
you okay? - Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.
screw all these people, Olive.
haven't you heard?
I already did.
you're going to hell, Olive! - What you're doing is wrong.
you're going to hell!
so they got Rhiannon.
never underestimate the power of extremists like Marianne.
they sense any weakness, they pounce like jungle cats.
and the whack pack just gets bigger and bigger.
but at least they have a pack.
I was used to being by myself, but I had never felt more alone.
I thought I should look into what they were running around thumping about.
do you have a religion section? - It's over there.
can I help you with something? - The Bible.
that's in bestsellers, right next to Twilight.
I didn't have time to read the whole thing because it's, like, 600 pages.
single-spaced.
and as every war that's ever been fought can tell you there are many ways you can interpret it.
except the Civil War. That was pure racism.
so I went to find an expert.
but really, I just kind of wanted someone to talk to.
forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
I think that's how you start these things.
I'm just going off what I've seen in movies.
where do I even start?
I've been pretending to be...
what is the Catholic way of phrasing this?
a harlot?
a harlot. It's not that I've actually been doing the things that people have been saying I've been doing but then again, I'm not denying them either.
so I was just wondering, is that wrong?
it's just that a lot of people have been asking me to do things and I thought it was okay because it wasn't real, you know?
it was make-believe.
and no one was getting hurt but a lot of people hate me now.
I kind of hate me too.
I might be wrong but aren't you supposed to say something?
tell me to say 10 Hail Marys, pay a fine advance token to nearest railroad? Hello?
should've seen that one coming.
luckily, I live in a town with many different places of worship.
so I went to find one with a real live human being.
can I help you?
Yeah, I was just wondering if there's a minister around.
is it not a minister?
a Reverend? A wizard?
it's a pastor, and he's here.
how can I help you today?
I was wondering what your church's stance on lying and adultery was.
it's not a good thing.
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly. But, then... Now, tell me this.
assuming there is a hell...
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes the existence of hell.
okay, so we'll just say there's a "hell."
there is. Just so we're clear.
okay. So for argument's sake... - No, there's no argument. It's there.
right below our feet, right above the Orient. It's there.
then what would be worse, lying or adultery?
or is lying about adultery just like double whammy? Sorry.
come on.
I'm sorry, what did you say your name was?
I didn't. I... You know what? I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna go check out Judaism because...
God. Two frames, really? - Sorry.
the Jews and I have a lot in common.
just fashion-wise and stuff. - Off you go.
Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice from the father of the leader of my lynch mob.
what other complete and total idiot can say that's happened to them?
okay, I've narrowed it down to The Other Boleyn Girl or The Bucket List. Huge hit.
why can't we watch a movie for kids? You always get to pick.
because the Family Member of the Week gets to pick the movie.
Yeah, but you get Family Member of the Week every week.
and there's a reason for that.
Yeah. You pick Family Member of the Week.
are you accusing me of nepotism?
okay, it's The Bucket List. This is it.
this is the greatest decision.
I'm so happy with this decision. That's what it's going to be.
all right, now, honey, after we watch The Bucket List remember to cross "Watch The Bucket List" off our bucket list.
guys.
I want you to know that if you hear around town I have chlamydia, that is totally false.
olive, do we need to have the talk again?
no. It's just a thing that's going around.
you know, nothing you're saying is making me feel any better.
not to mention how you've been dressing the last few days.
no judgment, but you look like a stripper.
mom. - A high-end stripper.
for governors or athletes.
but stripper, nonetheless.
Oh, my God. I'm just trying to mix it up a little.
and I have no STDs, I promise you.
Oh, that's great. Daughter of the Year.
if you hear anything to the contrary come up with some funny retort and walk away.
honey, you're kind of starting to worry us a little.
should we be kind of worried a little?
I don't think so.
you sure? - Yeah.
Yeah. I got it all under control.
okay. - Okay.
then let's Bucket List this bitch.
the Bucket List, The Bucket List.
to say this whole thing had taken over my life would be a colossal understatement.
I actually reread The Scarlet Letter to see how Hester dealt with it.
and it turns out she bore her punishment in humble silence which are two concepts I am not comfortable with.
with all the mythical play I was getting, I still actually hadn't been asked out on a real date.
people were jumping up and down to say they'd slept with me but no one bothered really trying to sleep with me.
I was starting to think I actually did have a gnome down there.
until finally... - Hey, Olive.
Hey, Anson. What's up?
I was wondering if you were busy tonight.
maybe wanna go out or something?
what did you have in mind?
I was thinking about getting a hot-air balloon, you know bringing along some champagne and then possibly reading some Sylvia Plath.
or we could just go to The Lobster Shack because it's, you know, a little easier.
I love The Lobster Shack. - Good.
okay. It's a date, then.
okay. - Okay.
so should I still bring the Sylvia Plath or?
no, we could stick our heads in the oven if we run out of things to talk about.
that was...
cool. All right. Well... - Cool.
you look really beautiful.
thank you.
you're a real gentleman. - No.
just a guy having dinner with a girl.
do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac?
I did not know it was.
medical science really has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance but guys just spend and spend to ply women with food they think is gonna get them lucky. Which is funny, because, it's like what is sexy about slurping back oysters? Nothing.
did you know some people actually eat ground-up rhinoceros horn because it's thought to increase the size of the male sex organ?
that's not true at all.
spanish fly. Spanish fly. You've heard of this? Yes?
Yes. - Okay. That thing?
pulverized blister beetle. What?
and it's illegal in the U. S.
because if you eat just a little bit too much, it causes painful urination, fever and bloody discharge.
am I talking too much? - No.
you're just burning through a lot of topics really fast.
shouldn't have had coffee three weeks ago.
I'm just kidding.
your Maine lobster with crab and seafood stuffing.
I'm jealous. - Thank you.
let's dig in. Right?
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd worked here.
he's dressed like a lobster.
I should start calling him Lobster Todd.
shit.
shit, shit, shit. - What? What's wrong?
Rhiannon's over there. - So?
she's been in love with you since 1st grade.
she's my best friend. - I thought you weren't speaking.
but that doesn't mean she's not my best friend.
or that I should be out with you.
Rhi and I don't have anything in common.
and you and I do? - Yeah.
like what? - Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.
if that's our connection, I should date the entire school.
haven't you?
no. No, I haven't.
okay, she can't see us. Check. Check.
can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.
I just remembered I am so allergic to shellfish.
I forget that my respiratory system will collapse.
I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip. - Thanks.
I'm sorry, but we have to go.
go. Go. Come on. Come on. - Okay.
go, go, go.
I'm sorry about that.
I've got something for you.
two hundred dollars to The Home Depot.
I didn't realize this was a...
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they really do have some awesome stuff.
I bought my air compressor there.
so, what did we do on this date?
whatever 200 bucks gets me.
that's not really how it works. - It's okay.
stop.
I'm not really having sex with people for money.
I'm saying I'm having sex for money, but I'm not having sex for money.
it's okay. It's all right. Come on.
stop. No, no. - What?
stop!
come on, just relax. Come on, babe. It's all right.
God. Asshole.
what are you doing? I paid you.
now you didn't.
come on, this is bullshit.
goddamn it.
Hey, Olive.
Todd, hi.
Hey, you all right? - I just have something in my eye.
like a twig, you know, or a branch, or a contact, or something.
I didn't know you wore contacts.
I don't, which is why I was tearing up.
olive, hey. Let me drive you home.
do you wanna talk about it?
what's to say? Everybody thinks I'm a whore and for the first time, I'm starting to believe it.
what?
don't act like you don't know what people are saying about me.
I know what people are saying. Doesn't mean I believe them.
who told you? - No one.
no one had to tell me that once upon a time, there was a scared kid at a party in a dark room who was not ready for his first kiss.
and, you know, there was this amazing girl who lied for him.
I still can't believe you remember that.
you know, sometimes I pretend you were my first real kiss.
yeah? - Yeah.
who was? - It was Rhiannon.
what? - She must have told you.
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like, a year after that or something.
it sucked, by the way. She was, like:
that bitch.
Oh, my God, she knew how I felt about you.
how do you feel about me? - And here I am feeling so bad.
that's just perfect.
wait, hold on a second. How do you feel about me?
felt.
I said "felt."
because I thought I... I thought I heard "feel."
no, it was "felt." - All right.
how do you know where I live?
we used to carpool.
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you like a savant for people's addresses?
just for people who I think are cool.
you think I'm cool? - I do.
and I think you're pretty and smart.
did you form this opinion prior to my little transformation?
way prior.
why didn't that rumor spread?
I like to keep my business to myself.
notoriety, for whatever reason never seems to benefit the noted, it's only the "notees."
where were you two weeks ago?
olive.
if I promise not to tell anyone, could I kiss you right now?
no.
okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. - Oh, no.
I just mean, not like this.
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara running down my face and some horndog guy just having tried to stick his tongue down my throat.
I've wanted to kiss you since 8th grade but I want it to be perfect.
and right now, my life is a mess.
I need to get my business in order before I drag you into it.
what if I told you I wanna be dragged into it?
I could help, maybe.
why now?
why are you all of a sudden into me now?
I don't know.
I haven't overanalyzed it, like you're about to.
good night, Olive. - Good night, Lobster Todd.
now that I knew there were decent and goodhearted people out there .the lies had to stop.
I knew there was only one person I could count on to set the story straight:
Brandon.
I'd helped him, and even though it would destroy his new reputation as a straight stud, I knew he'd help me.
Oh, my God. Did you hear that Brandon ran away from home?
Yeah, totally. He left his parents a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches" and then he skipped town with some big, hulking black guy.
my apologies to Mark Twain.
wait, huh? - What?
you said something. - You said something.
you said something, so I came back.
you're funny. Okay. - Call me.
I went to everyone I'd helped and begged them to say it wasn't true.
no way. I gave you money.
you gave me a gift card to AutoZone. I don't even have a car.
I thought it'd be aspirational.
Evan, please do this for me, all right? I did that for you. Do this for me.
I don't want people to know I didn't go to second base with you.
do you know how many girls I've hooked up with because of that?
girls are almost as dumb as boys.
Oh, yes, they are.
it gets worse.
honor your father and your mother.
due to his condition, Micah was sent on a visit to his grandparents in Palatka, Florida.
and if there's one thing worse than chlamydia, it's Florida.
...be guilty of adultery.
get your hands out of your berries, boy.
olive, life is full of choices.
I made a bad one. But then, so did you.
but I see no other alternative than to just live with the guilt.
my guilt stems from my indiscretion and yours for lying.
we made our choices. Now, we just have to let it ride.
or I could just tell everyone the truth and get you fired and put in jail.
okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?
it's perfectly legal in the state of California.
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.
and secondly, let's play the Who Would You Believe game, okay?
why don't you ask yourself, if you were an adult, who would you believe?
who would you believe? Who would you believe?
who would you believe? Who?
thank you for coming in.
Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but I still shouldn't have done what I did.
your wife has chlamydia, and she's sleeping with a student and she gave it to him, and she's trying to blame me.
what?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Griffith, if you ever see this, just know that I was wrong to tell you that in that way. At all.
I shouldn't have done it.
and I don't even feel bad for lying for your wife.
but I hate myself for telling you the truth. I am so sorry.
with my words, even though they were true, I ended a marriage.
looking back, that's the thing I regret the most.
so now everyone that knows the truth is either gone or they won't fess up.
and Marianne Bryant and her disciples are demanding my head.
the messed-up thing is I would not put it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.
I had a similar situation when I was your age.
what? Everyone called you a slut?
I had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me.
Why? - Because I was a slut.
I slept with a whole bunch of people. A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.
mom. - Sorry, I got around.
before I met Dad, I had incredibly low self-worth.
do me a favor and just stuff this down my throat until I asphyxiate to death.
it's true. It is. - I want to die.
it's true. I was quite the contortionist.
I could do this thing. I could go... I mean, my leg all the way...
stop. Can you stop? Don't show me.
can you not see that I'm a mess? - No, you're not, Olive.
you're wonderful.
and you'll handle this the same way I did.
with an incontrovertible sense of humor.
but you're much smarter than I am so you'll come out of this much better than I did.
thank you, Mom.
I could get my leg so far back. - No, no, no. Stop it.
so it was time to put an end to all this once and for all by telling my side of the story.
and that's why I decided to do this webcast.
so here we go.
part five.
not with a fizzle, but with a bang.
today we had yet another one of our ridiculous pep rallies.
Todd convinced the band to play the sexiest song in their repertoire.
I needed to pique everyone's interest to get them to go home and log on.
I had one outfit left and I figured about 30 seconds to do it.
plus I really wanted my own awesome musical number for no apparent reason.
is that Olive?
this was just a free preview.
for the main event, log on to www. FreeOlive. com tonight at 6 p. m.
and I know it interferes with the basketball game but, come on would you rather cheer on the Woodchucks or watch me do one?
what do you think you're doing? Get to my office right now.
I can't, because I have a date with the guy I like and the rest of the school.
I think before you expel me, you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith because I think she might talk you into letting me stay.
go, Woodchucks!
and here you all are .waiting outside the bedroom door for me to kiss Todd, listening to me pretend to have sex with Brandon, paying me to lie for you and calling me every name in the book.
you know, it was just like Hester in The Scarlet Letter.
except that's the one thing the movies don't tell you:
how shitty it feels to be an outcast. Warranted or not.
how did you know I love this song?
I guessed.
I see you've been watching my live webcast. It's still going on, you know.
screw them. They've had enough of you. Figuratively speaking.
I borrowed my neighbor's mower. I came right over.
that almost rhymed.
I know. I spent a minute on it.
I'll be right down.
that's Todd.
not that I owe you guys any more confessions, but I really like this guy and I might even lose my virginity to him.
I don't know when it'll happen.
you know, it might be five minutes from now or tonight or six months from now or maybe on our wedding night.
but the really amazing thing is, it is nobody's goddamn business.
come on, where's she going?
I thought she was going to take her clothes off.
demi Moore took her clothes off. This is bullshit.
come on. Are you kidding me?
piss off. - Come here, you punk.
Jack?
Rhi, sorry I lied to you
that's a mighty snug little shelter, Huck.
I judge it's all right.
here, Jim, I'll take my turn at steering now.
no, that's all right, Huck. I like steering.
blue Devils!
... who was asked by the city of Philadelphia...
... if she cold offer psychological conseling to Cambodian refgees...
... boat people, who had recently arrived in the city.
deborah was danted by the task. These Cambodians...
... had sffered genocide, starvation, relatives mrdered before their eyes...
... years in refgee camps, harrowing boat trips to the West.
how could she relate to their suffering?
how could she help these people?
so guess what all these people wanted to talk about...
... with my friend Deborah, the psychologist.
it was all, "I met this guy in the refgee camp.
I thought he really loved me, but when we got separated...
... he took up with my cousin. Now he says he loves me...
... and keeps calling me. They're married now. What shold I do?
this is how we are.
may I help you?
I'm Liz Gilbert. I'm writing a magazine article on Bali.
I wanted to meet a medicine man.
everyone said I should meet Ketut Liyer. Am I in the right place?
wait.
I mean, here I am with a ninth-generation medicine man...
... and what do I wanna ask him about?
getting closer to God?
saving the world's starving children?
happy to see you. I am Ketut Liyer.
Nope. I wanna discuss my relationship.
you are a world traveler.
you will live a long time...
...have many friends, many experiences.
you will have two marriages. One long, one short.
am I in the long one or the short one?
can't tell.
also you will lose all your money.
I think in next six to 10 months.
don't worry. You will get it all back again.
and you will come back to Bali...
...and live here for three or four months and teach me English.
I never had anybody to practice my English with.
and then...
...I will teach you everything I know.
wait.
I have this for you.
keep grounded so it's like you have four legs.
that way, you can stay in this world.
also, no looking at world through your head.
look through your heart instead.
that way, you will know God.
which is why you came here, no?
see you later, alligator.
I proofread all of her manuscripts.
my wife is very, very beautiful, but she can't spell for anything.
look at Uncle Stephen.
and Auntie Liz.
I'm counting the minutes for this to be over so I can get in my big-girl pants.
you look fantastic. You just had a baby.
Oh, you're lying. I'm fat, I'm exhausted...
...I can't keep two thoughts. I feel like Liza Minnelli.
Stephen, can you hold Jack?
I'm gonna introduce you to Walter. - Yeah.
Hey, dude, you wanna grab a beer or something?
my new book comes out in April. Thank you for asking.
great. - May.
may. May.
this is Andre. You two are Times' Most Notable nominees.
so glad to finally meet you. - Nice to finally meet you.
I fed him nachos. Is that bad?
you look comfortable. What'd you feed him, chloroform?
give him to his dad. - I told you, nachos.
know what? I'd be asleep too if I had a dump like that.
we'll give him to his mom. - Come here then.
wanna help me change his diaper? - Yes, I do.
Hey, how's the vintage car thing going?
Oh, no, no, no. I changed jobs. I'm a pastry chef now.
you mean you're a baker. - Yeah.
you wanna get baked?
I know, I know.
it's hard, isn't it?
Oh, no. This is so much fun.
did you know the exact moment you wanted to have a baby?
I can't remember, but I've had the box since before I got married.
what box?
it's girly and embarrassing, and you'll laugh at me if I tell you.
I will laugh at you, but you still have to tell me.
come on.
under the bed.
I've been filling it with baby things...
...waiting until Andy was ready to be a father.
so sweet.
does this come in my size?
I have a box just like this, except it's filled with National Geographics...
...and The Times travel section.
all the places I wanna see before I die.
Liz, having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face.
you kind of wanna be fully committed.
so my trip to Aruba next week, which is just a basic, you know...
..."where to sleep, swim and stuff your face" piece...
I got a new bikini.
and it turns out, I have unlimited minibar access.
you know what that means? - Jet lag?
you, me...
...macadamia nuts.
that was cute.
you know who I was talking to at the party who was really inspiring...
...was Tara's friend. - Brian.
Brian. Unbelievable. He's a teacher, you know that?
he's a substitute teacher, isn't he?
Yeah. He was talking about the budget cuts that are happening now.
there's no money for anything.
there's no music classes, there's no arts classes.
they're volunteering their time to do all of this after school.
they're educating our kids, you know?
I think you'd make a great teacher, honey.
thank you, but I was thinking more of like...
...education. Getting my master's, going back to school. I don't know.
you know?
... You know...
going back to school. - I'm just thinking out loud.
I was getting the sinking feeling that Kett's prophecy was coming tre.
was I in the shorter marriage?
we'd only boght this hose a year ago.
hadn't I wanted this?
I had actively participated in every moment of the creation...
... of this life.
so why didn't I see myself in any of it?
the only thing more impossible than staying...
... was leaving.
I didn't wanna hrt anybody. I wanted to slip qietly ot the back door...
... and not stop rnning ntil I reached Greenland.
instead, I made a decision.
to pray.
yo know, like, to God.
and it was sch a foreign concept to me, that I swear I almost began with:
I'm a big fan of yor work.
Hello, God?
nice to finally meet you. I...
I am sorry I've never spoken directly to you before...
...but...
...I hope I've expressed my...
...ample gratitude for all the blessings you've given...
...to me in my life.
I'm in serious trouble.
I don't know what to do.
I need an answer.
please, tell me what to do.
Oh, God, help me, please.
tell me what to do and I'll do it.
go back to bed, Liz.
I don't wanna go to Aruba.
I don't wanna be married.
you know, there's a whole divorce section downstairs.
pepper grinder. - She's having...
...a nervous breakdown. - This is what girls do.
she's processing. - Why doesn't she get drunk or laid?
that's what I would do if you left me.
no, you wouldn't.
no, I wouldn't. - She moved out, she filed for divorce.
they were together eight years. She's got no home.
legacy.
every word in Italian is like a truffle. A magic trick.
honey, I get it. It's your life raft right now.
when Andy and I broke up for two weeks, I bought a loom.
a frigging loom. And he tried to start a microbrewery.
I don't know how you guys aren't sick of me now. I'm sick of me.
are you kidding me? We love having you.
it's kind of like having a writer in residence.
but you are a writer. You should be writing something.
maybe I could write about a woman who goes to Italy to learn Italian.
call it Carbohydrates and Conjgations.
I'll start looking for a place.
I'm falling in love with you. - I'm not who you think I am.
I'm just your fantasy.
no, that's bullshit. You're real.
your scars, your talent.
the fact that I own a piece-of-crap bar...
...and you accept that that's all I'm gonna do.
okay, this sucks.
I second that. - Don't be rude.
I love your pain.
and I love that when we're together, I can make it go away.
Oh, he's good. - Your love...
he's hot, there's a difference. ...is like a hot panini.
and when I look into your eyes, I hear dolphins clapping.
I did not write that line.
here's what he doesn't know yet.
I disappear into the person I love.
I am the permeable membrane. If I love you, you can have it all.
my money, my time, my body...
...my dog, my dog's money.
I will assume your debts and project upon you...
...all sorts of nifty qualities you've never actually cultivated in yourself.
I will give you all this and more...
...until I am so exhausted and depleted...
...the only way I can recover...
...is by becoming infatuated with someone else.
Elizabeth, hi. - Hi.
Oh, really?
how you doing?
Cheers.
thank you. - I owe you an apology.
for the walkouts. - Well, I'm not everyone's cup of tea.
I doubt that.
I, on the other hand, was shit.
although I was trying very hard. - "Shit" is a strong word.
thank you.
you seem shorter in person than on the stage.
Really? I hear that a lot. - Sorry.
it's good.
it's unnerving when...
...a total stranger sees you more clearly than you see yourself.
that's what I mean by saying you're short.
are you hearing dolphins clapping right now?
I took a few liberties with your material.
I give you full permission to make fun of me. I know you're dying to.
you're far too charming to make fun of.
I'm still hearing them.
is that your guru?
you're joking, but, yes, it is.
she's beautiful.
Yeah. A friend told me about her.
I was out of work and feeling pretty desperate for something.
not the last time I was out of work, the time before that.
and I just had this feeling like I was looking in all the wrong places.
looking for what?
God.
she has an ashram in India. I'm dying to go, but...
...you know, you have to get, like, three stages of hepatitis shots...
...and my insurance always runs out.
I'll go when the time's right.
there's a gathering of her students every morning.
if you want, I could take you sometime.
if you're not unnerved by 100 crunchy people chanting in Sanskrit.
I need to be unnerved.
David. A yogi from Yonkers.
I didn't exactly fall in love with the gy.
what happened was I dove ot of my marriage...
... and into David's arms...
... exactly the same way a cartoon circs performer...
... dives off a high platform and into a small cup of water...
... vanishing completely.
your underwear, my queen.
he just folded my delicates.
Oh, my God, baby, you are in so much trouble.
Thirty-six?
my client is simply not interested in a divorce.
is he serious?
is he really representing himself?
one semester of law school right here, baby.
great. Well, what would it take to interest your client?
okay, so here's the deal. You have screwed up my life...
...but what I wanna know is why couldn't you find yourself...
...in our marriage? Why didn't you say what you were thinking?
I did. You never listened to me. - No. You never said:
Hey, you know what? You suck. I'm deeply unhappy.
you just took off. You never gave me a chance to address those problems.
that's not fair. That's just quitting. I took vows.
till death. And I take them seriously.
I believe this is just a phase and I'm willing to wait it out.
you are always waiting, Stephen.
waiting for me to come home, to wanna have kids...
...to make you dinner. I don't know why we can't accept...
...we don't wanna live in unhappiness anymore.
I accept the fact that I am occasionally unreliable...
...and I often get sidetracked, but I thought you liked that about me.
I thought it was okay that I had hopes and dreams.
have a dream. Stephen, great, fine. Do that. Just pick one.
okay, I pick one. I pick you.
I know this is awful.
but I believe with every molecule of my body that you will find the person...
...that wants just what you want.
that will give you what you want and what you deserve. I'm not her.
well, you obviously know nothing about what I want.
my client would like to submit a song he wrote...
...that he believes is relevant to these proceedings. Goes something like this:
are you kidding?
quitter, quitter, quitter!
how about I take the blame? I am the one who couldn't deal...
...with another weekend roaming some box-shaped superstore...
...buying appliances on credit...
...and pretending to be a couple that neither one of us ever knew how to be.
you wanted that toaster.
you like faking it, fine. You're stellar. I'm the failure. I suck at faking it.
it was not my finest hour. - So where do things stand now?
we're prepared to offer half of everything...
...including my client's retirement accounts.
take it all then. Everything.
he still said no.
he hates me now. - He doesn't hate you.
his heart is broken.
I think he hates you.
I'm never letting you out of the basement.
why don't we talk next week and we'll see where things stand?
okay. - These things have a way...
...of working themselves out.
so why'd you become a vegetarian?
I saw some cows slaughtered one time.
barely touched your dinner.
he's 28.
this is hard for him, isn't it? And you?
the meditations help.
Liz.
you remember a couple of years ago, when you threw yourself into...
...the renovation of your kitchen? You were consumed...
...with being the perfect wife and cook.
I was trying to make it work.
well, I think chanting and meditation is the same thing...
...in a different costume.
definitely give me that documentary.
I've been thinking about vegetarianism.
my triglycerides are through the roof.
Yeah. Thanks for everything.
great to meet you.
what? - Nothing. It's just...
...you know, you used to look like Stephen.
now you kind of look like David.
you know?
what I meant was, you know how people start resembling their dogs?
why would he say that, we look like the same dog?
he was joking. - Not funny.
well, he had five Heinekens. He was bombed.
well, not funny.
we don't look like the same dog.
if anything, you're a collie and I'm a Tibetan mastiff.
don't you wanna give me a chance to miss you?
yo wanna go away for a year?
do yo know what I felt when I woke up, Delia?
nothing. No passion, no spark, no faith, no heat. Absolutely nothing.
I've gotten past the point where I can be calling this a bad moment.
and it just terrifies me. Jesus, this is like worse than death to me...
...the idea that this is the person I'm gonna be from now on.
this happens to people.
they fall in love in their 20s, get married...
...do the granite countertop, white-picket fence in their 30s...
...and somewhere they realize, "This is not for me.
so they fail and they fall down, they hurt like hell, they straighten up...
...and march their asses to the shrink's office.
they can't just check out. - I am not checking out.
I need to change.
you have a support system here, Liz.
you have friends and family who love you.
and do you feel my love for you? My support for you? No.
there's, like, nothing. I have no pulse.
I am going to Italy. - Italy. Why Italy?
what did you have for lunch? - I don't know. A salad.
exactly. I used to have this appetite for food, for my life...
...and it is just gone.
I wanna go someplace where I can marvel at something.
language, gelato, spaghetti, something.
you're talking like a college kid. - I've been acting like one.
since I was 15, I've either been with a guy or breaking up with a guy.
I have not given myself two weeks of a breather...
...to just deal with, you know, myself.
what's going on with you and David?
what, did you fall out?
I don't know how to be here.
you wanna know how to be here? Stop constantly waiting for something.
I'm going to Italy and then I'm going to David's guru's ashram in India...
...and I'm going to end the year in Bali.
that's what I'm gonna do.
that's harder to argue with. The beaches are nice. But why?
Ketut told me I would. - Guy with no teeth.
when you're desperate...
...and some guy who, yes, looks a little like Yoda...
...hands you a prophecy, you have to respond.
do you need a Xanax? - Always.
okay, I'm just gonna say it. I'm gonna say it and be done with it.
what if it doesn't work?
my whole life fits in a 12-foot-square box.
you know how many times I hear that in a day?
most of them never come back for their whole life.
Hello? - Liz.
good news. Stephen just signed the divorce papers.
I'll probably be back in a week, penniless with dysentery.
you're my hero.
Hey.
if you stay, we'll go out for Indian every night.
you never asked me to stay.
go, go, go.
there is a wonderfl old Italian joke...
... abot a poor man who goes to chrch every day...
... and prays before the state of a great saint, begging:
dear saint, please, please, please let me win the lottery.
finally, the exasperated state comes to life...
... and looks down at the begging man and says:
my son, please, please, please by a ticket.
so now I get the joke.
and I've got three tickets.
you heat the water on the stove.
so if I want to bathe?
you put the water in the tub.
okay.
Yeah. It doesn't really seem like enough water to bathe in.
not enough.
Yes, it's enough.
fill it up three, four, five times.
everything that's important gets cleaned.
is this safe? This...
...scaffolding?
it holds up the ceiling.
otherwise it will fall apart.
everything falls apart, my dear.
the only thing permanent in life is family.
you're not married.
no, divorziata.
why divorced?
we broke it.
you're more happy now?
I have one rule.
no strange men spending the night.
you American girls when you come to Italy...
...all you want is pasta...
...and sausage.
I'll take it.
good. You chose well.
cappuccino.
it's a zoo in here. - And my Italian sucks.
how long have you been here? - Two weeks. You?
six weeks. You'll get better.
two cappuccinos, please.
and warm the milk this time.
yesterday it was too hot and burned my tongue.
you like Napoleons? - Of course.
and two Napoleons, please.
your Italian is fantastic.
I have a wonderful tutor. I'll give you his number if you like.
he's really good and he needs work. - Oh, great.
are you Dutch? German?
Swedish. Even colder people, if you can imagine.
I'm Liz, by the way. - Sofi.
you can say:
it's past.
too fast, but okay.
you can say:
what a beautiful word.
come on, it's "let's cross over." It's so ordinary.
no, it's the perfect combination of Italian sounds.
it's the wistful "ah," the rolling trill, the soothing "ess."
that's true. - I love it.
all right, let me teach you a word.
therapist.
therapist.
come on. - Good. You gotta learn humor.
it's not. - Come on. Cheers.
shall we continue Tuesday at 5? - Yes.
with another bottle of the therapy? - Of course.
you're doing very well, Liz. - Thank you.
and you must be very polite with yourself...
...when you learn something new.
Yes. Grazie, I agree.
but your English... How are you even talking to me like this right now?
I think you're gonna teach me more than I teach you.
you have good Italian. Very good.
all right.
I am alone.
I feel so guilty. I've been in Rome for three weeks...
...all I've done is learn a few Italian words and eat.
you feel guilty because you're American.
you don't know how to enjoy yourself.
I beg your pardon? - It's true.
americans know entertainment, but don't know pleasure.
this is Luca Spaghetti, by the way, you know.
your name is Luca Spaghetti?
Yes, that's what our family is called.
we invented it. I'm serious. Listen to me.
you want to know your problem? Americans.
you work too hard. You get burned out.
then you come home and spend the whole weekend...
...in your pajamas in front of the TV.
that's not far off, actually.
but you don't know pleasure. You have to be told you've earned it.
you see a commercial that says, "It's Miller time..."
...and you say, "That's right. Now I will go to buy a six-pack.
and drink the whole thing and wake up the next morning and you feel terrible.
but an Italian doesn't need to be told.
he walks by a sign that says, "you deserve a break today..."
...and he says, "Yeah, I know."
that's why I'm planning on taking a break at noon...
...to go over to your house and sleep with your wife.
we call it "dolce far niente.
it means...
...the sweetness of doing nothing. We are masters of it.
he's right. He says...
...you can't learn Italian like this.
you don't speak the language just with your mouth, speak it with your hands.
like this?
okay. Is yelling.
"that MEAL WAS EX CELLENT!"
"suck IT!"
all this gives me a stomachache.
"screw YOU!"
I think that's my neighbor Lorenzo. - Charming.
another way to say "SCREW YOU..."
so anyway, to start off I'd say...
excuse me.
come here.
for the table...
...a big platter of artichoke alla giudia...
...prosciutto with melon...
...and eggplant with ricotta affumicata.
then spaghetti alla carbonara...
...pappardelle with ragu of rabbit...
...and linguini with clams.
then tripe alla romana...
...and saltimbocca.
and two more liters of the vino sfuso from Genzano.
thank you.
you did it. Yes.
Liz Gilbert, you are a Roman woman now.
no, only honorary.
that is a real Roman woman.
Yeah, with a lot of international friends.
that one, I'd bite.
maybe you and Rome just have different words.
different words? - Yeah.
Yeah. It's like each city has a word, if you really think about it.
like, what is the word for London?
I would say "stuffy." - I would agree with that.
what's the word for Stockholm? - Are you kidding? "Conform."
and New York?
"ambition" or "soot."
what's the word for Rome?
it's kind of difficult to think about.
it's classic.
sex.
of course.
so, what's your word, Liz? I'm curious. I can't figure it out.
well...
it might be...
it started as "daughter." I was good at that. And then...
..."wife." Not so good.
girlfriend.
not so good.
my word's "writer."
Yeah, but that's what you do. That isn't who you are, no?
maybe you're a woman in search of her word.
Hey, Sofi, it's Liz. Let's go to Naples. Maybe my word is "pizza."
listen, lady, I am only 7, but I can tell you're a complete moron...
...because I am from Naples.
I love this place, but Giovanni said to watch out.
his cousin got mugged here in a museum.
are you serious? - Watch out for the scooter. Yeah.
I'm in love. I'm having a relationship with my pizza.
you look like you're breaking up with the pizza. What's the matter?
I can't.
what do you mean, you can't? This is pizza in Napoli.
it is your moral imperative to eat that pizza.
I want to, but I've gained, like, 10 pounds.
I mean, I've got this...
right here. What's it called? What's the word?
a muffin top.
I have one too.
I unbuttoned my jeans five minutes ago just looking at this.
let me ask you a question.
in all the years you've ever undressed in front of a gentleman...
hasn't been that many. - All right, well...
...has he ever asked you to leave?
has he ever walked out? Left? - No.
because he doesn't care.
he's in a room with a naked girl. He's won the lottery.
I'm so tired of saying no and then waking up in the morning...
...and recalling every single thing I ate the day before.
counting every calorie so I know exactly...
...how much self-Ioathing to take into the shower.
I'm going for it.
I have no interest in being obese. I'm just through with the guilt.
this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna finish this pizza...
...and then we're gonna go watch the soccer game.
and tomorrow we're gonna go on a little date...
...and buy ourselves some bigger jeans.
giovanni likes a muffin.
Attagirl.
he's saying, "For whom are you playing?"
per chi, for whom.
pull, pull. I'm sucking it in.
put some Swedish muscle into this.
you think this happened to Sophia Loren?
there it goes. Almost got it.
go, go, go. You're not trying.
I've almost got it. I've almost got it. I did it.
Oh, that's beautiful. You should get it.
for whom?
for you, Liz. Just for you.
no, I'm happy just with my big lady pants.
thanks for the day. And the leg room.
it was fun.
we're gonna go for food. Wanna come?
no. No, I'm good.
the sweetness of doing nothing.
please. Please get off the floor.
will you please just? Will you come up here?
what if we just acknowledge that we have a screwed-up relationship...
...and we stick it out anyway?
we accept that we fight a lot...
...and we hardly have sex anymore...
...but that we don't wanna live without each other.
and that way we can spend our lives together...
...miserable...
...but happy not to be apart.
dear David:
we haven't had any commnication in a while...
... and it's given me time I needed to think.
remember when yo said we shold live with each other and be nhappy...
... so we cold be happy?
consider it a testimony to how mch I love yo...
... that I spent so long poring myself into that offer...
... trying to make it work.
bt a friend took me to the most amazing place the other day.
it's called the Agstem.
Octavian Agsts bilt it to hose his remains.
when the barbarians came, they trashed it along with everything else.
the great Agsts, Rome's first tre great emperor...
... how cold he have imagined that Rome...
... the whole world, as far as he was concerned, wold be in rins?
during the Dark Ages, someone came in here and stole the emperor's ashes.
in the 12th century, it became a fortress...
...then a bullring.
they stored fireworks in here after that.
nowadays, it's a bathroom for the homeless...
...so you better watch your step going down.
it's one of the qietest and loneliest places in Rome.
the city has grown p arond it over centries.
it feels like a precios wond...
... like a heartbreak yo won't let go of becase it hrts too good.
I like it messy.
we all want things to stay the same, David.
I guess the guy before me must've been some angel, huh?
settle for living in misery...
... becase we're afraid of change, of things crmbling to rins.
then I looked arond in this place, at the chaos it's endred...
... the way it's been adapted, brned, pillaged...
... then fond a way to bild itself back p again, and I was reassred.
maybe my life hasn't been so chaotic. It's jst the world that is...
... and the only real trap is getting attached to any of it.
rin is a gift.
rin is the road to transformation.
Hey.
you ready?
Yeah.
even in this eternal city, the Agstem showed me...
... that we mst always be prepared for endless waves of transformation.
both of s deserve better than staying together...
... becase we're afraid we'll be destroyed if we don't.
my mother's stuffing. Stale bread, walnuts, got those.
will you get me some more potatoes?
Oh, I'm always getting you more potatoes.
it's my dream, a real American Thanksgiving.
the perfect way to say goodbye to our Liz.
so...
...you leave this week, huh? - Yes.
and where are you going? Iran?
india.
Liz is making us an American meal tonight.
you are not married, yeah? - No.
what's wrong with your friend, is she a lesbian?
no, Mama, she's not a lesbian. And she understands Italian.
how's she going to find another husband and start a family...
...when she's on the other side of the world?
if a man said, "I'm going to travel for a year and meet wonderful people...
but she's not a man.
it's more difficult for a woman to feel that she has the right to make choices.
it takes a lot of courage. - Exactly.
you call it courage, I call it stupidity.
mama, enough.
I know a number of people who would agree with you.
Luca?
what time will the turkey be ready?
the turkey...
I haven't defrosted it yet.
Oh, shit.
you only had one thing to do and you screwed it up.
I was distracted! It can happen!
too much good food!
too many women!
and I forgot!
now, before we eat, everyone...
...it is Thanksgiving, so let us give thanks.
Yeah. Come on, join hands. - Okay.
so we just say what we...
what we thank God for tonight. Sofi, why don't you start?
I am grateful for you, Liz...
...for helping me appreciate life...
...with all that comes with it...
...muffin tops and bad times.
and for Giovanni...
...for making me feel...
...Ioved and secure.
I thank God for...
...fear...
...because for the first time...
...I'm afraid the person next to me...
...will be the one who wants to leave.
Liz?
well, this all makes me so grateful.
seeing all you happy people...
...who know how to love each other and take care of each other.
I look at the amazing women I've met who I admire so much...
...and the great men, taking care of their women...
...and putting their children to bed.
I just feel happy...
...to see it and to be part of it.
I'm the luckiest girl in the world.
it's a good breakfast, huh?
I will take this to your room.
it has already started.
I fell asleep. - Yeah. Pity.
probably the only person in the world who ever fell asleep during meditation.
this leads to the meditation garden. - Is the guru here?
she's always here. - I know, but is she "here" here?
she's at her ashram in New York.
but I came from New York to see her here.
sounds like one of her little tricks.
the meditation cave.
it's open 24l7 and it's air-conditioned.
Corella?
this is Liz Gilbert. - Hi. Nice to meet you.
where did you get that button? - They sell them in the bookstore.
that is exactly what I need. I need something like that. I don't listen.
I never have. My mom used to call me Little Miss Chatty Cathy...
...because I just ramble. I am a rambler.
I am rambling now. I'm sorry.
silence is a wonderful spiritual practice...
...but if Corella could speak, she'd tell you it's more challenging than it looks.
wait till you've been here for a while. - Okay.
thank you, Corella. I'll be sure to tell her.
what did she say? - No idea.
change into your work clothes. I'll take you to your seva.
it's a Hindu word for "selfless devotional work."
it's required of everyone who stays. - Okay. Thank you.
is there anything in this world skinnier than an Indian teenage boy?
I'm Tulsi. - Liz.
where are you from?
the next town. My parents have been devotees of the guru for many years.
we spend a lot of time here.
but...
...they are trying to marry me off. That's the custom.
that's not what you want? - No way. It sucks.
I want to study psychology, just as our guru did when she attended college.
I prefer to be with God than boys my age.
no one in my family understands my coming all the way to India.
do you ever look at them and wonder, "What am I doing in this family?
you have no idea.
it is most commendable that you ended your marriage.
you seem like such a happy, free person now.
I think my ex-husband would describe me as selfish.
you mustn't be angry with yourself or disappointed.
you don't have to make children or be married to have a family.
Oh, man. They got mosquitoes here big enough...
...to stand flat-footed and screw a chicken.
I love you. - Liz, have you met...
...Richard from Texas? - Hello, Richard from Texas.
nice to meet you, Groceries. - Groceries?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you eating before I saw you.
I never seen anybody eat so much at one time.
you sure do enjoy your groceries.
you know, it's been a rough day, and if no one takes it personally...
...I'm going to take my large meal someplace else to eat it in silence.
Oh, no, stay. I'm done.
looked like you were working through some...
...pretty rough stuff this morning.
stuff with your ex-husband?
I got an ex-wife.
she thinks I changed my name to "Motherfucker."
I...
I just spent some time in Rome and I came here feeling so great.
and now here I am, at the source...
...and I feel more disconnected than ever.
why'd you come here?
I just want some peace.
peace?
you wanna get to the castle, Groceries...
...you got to swim the moat.
here, you can finish that. I know you can.
okay.
simply empty yor mind.
breathe.
what am I going to do when this year is over?
where am I going to live?
well, maybe Chicago.
Oh, my God. I cold bild a meditation room...
no. Stop thinking. Why is this so hard?
screw you, Corella. How the hell does she do this?
she looks like frigging Mother Teresa.
Oh, my God, kill me.
who's in the moat today? - Shut up.
sounds like you wrestled some big-ass crocs.
you know what? If you're so goddamn smart, what are you doing here?
if you're here, it makes you smart already.
do you wanna talk about what...? - No, not to you. Thank you.
I'm the only one here. You're gonna talk about it sooner or later.
I cannot focus in there.
all I think about is my meditation room and how to decorate.
are you shitting me?
are you kidding me?
the meditation room is within, Groceries. Decorate that.
do you always talk in bumper sticker?
I do, and here's another one.
you have to learn to select your thoughts the way you select...
...your clothes every day. That's a power you can cultivate.
you wanna come here and control your life so bad, work on the mind.
that's the only thing you should control.
if you can't master your thoughts, you're in trouble.
I am trying.
Yeah, hello, that's the damn problem. Stop trying. Surrender.
go out into the garden and just sit there and still your mind...
...and you watch what happens.
why don't you just let it be?
has anyone ever told you you look like James Taylor?
every day.
God, he really does.
my prayers were always the same.
please, God, please. Open my heart, send me a sign...
...because we both know I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
look at you, floating through Calcutta.
looks like you had a great meditation.
I probably have malaria now.
the bites will go away.
eventually everything goes away.
you ever done that, Groceries? Begged for a sign?
that sounds vaguely familiar.
be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
what is your problem?
did you fall in love with the wrong woman or something?
excuse me, Miss Gilbert.
you have a phone call.
how's the Gr Gita treating you?
fine. You'd like her.
did you get my e-mail?
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.
why didn't you?
becase if I didn't respond...
...we were still having a conversation. I was still in it.
I'm sorry. We were just bad timing.
I just wanted things to be easy. We were good when things were easy.
it's not that I need "easy" right now. I just can't have "so hard.
well, you sound good.
stronger.
so do you.
Yeah, well, I'm an actor, Liz.
I got a part.
it's off-Broadway, bt it's pretty cool.
I'm happy for you.
all right.
well, I'll see you around, kid.
check you out.
I have never seen you so focused.
you need a Thums Up.
no, no. No lips on the bottle.
first rule in India is never touch anything but yourself.
Oh, good God. That's, like, five times sweeter than Coke.
I think it might have methamphetamines in it.
we can only hope.
I know you feel awful.
but your life's changing.
that's not a bad thing.
and you're in the perfect place for it. Surrounded by grace.
I thought I was over him, but...
...I love him.
big deal.
so you fell in love with someone. - I really miss him.
so miss him.
send him some light and love every time you think of him, then drop it.
you know, if you could clear out all that space in your mind...
...that you're using to obsess over this guy...
...and your failed marriage, you'd have a vacuum with a doorway.
and you know what the universe would do with that doorway?
rush in. God would rush in.
fill you with more love than you ever dreamed of. Man.
groceries.
I think you have the capacity someday to love the whole world.
what do they sell over there?
Ganesh. Remover of obstacles.
I'm gonna need a lot of these.
speaking of elephants, there's a rogue elephant on the loose in the area.
he was with carnival.
they say he is very, very unpredictable and volatile.
that just makes him more attractive to her.
how'd you get to be so smart? I'll bet it was the hard way.
don't change the subject.
well, when is this grieving phase going to pass?
you want a day on a calendar you can circle?
can you give me one? - No. You got to do the work.
meditate and go to seva...
...and most important, get your butt down to the Geet every morning...
...and something'll change.
I just cannot get through the Gr Gita. I can't find that feeling of devotion.
okay. Devotion's love. Pick somebody or something you wanna devote it to.
it doesn't have to be the guru. It's all the same to her.
this is about you.
can I tell you something, Groceries? You got some serious control issues.
is it obvious?
all right, Richard, get out from inside my head now.
shut the door.
that's him? - That's him.
he's hideous. - No, he's not. He's cute.
he's a Sagittarius.
he studies computer programming in Delhi.
he has very good grades.
and his family is very, very wealthy.
you're a big venue now.
global commerce, sports franchises. . .
chit-chat cafes.
but you don't get it because you don't see it.
life is not what you think it is.
because of guys like us. . . you can go on thinking it. . .
til reality sets in.
reality's a motherfucker.
the first thing you do when it hits you. . .
is wonder where we are.
we do our shit.
you do yours.
but remember. . . it's a dirty world.
and without us, it'd be a whole lot dirtier.
welcome to Edison.
heads up. 2 harbor cops just showed up.
we got problems in here. If they come into bank, shoot 'em.
any units near 12th and Plaza, respond to an alarm at Plaza Bank.
approach with caution.

you got a mortgage? You guys fucked up tonight.
don't look at me. Don't fuckin' look at me.
okay, this is how it works.
you never saw us. And we never saw you.
the world just keeps turnin' .
you ain't takin' us in? - Nah.
got to all school.
we answer up, get capped for losin' that shit.
Yeah, maybe you should leave town.
Motha' fuckers.
we'll get his license. Rat his ass out to the Feds.
tired of this bullshit. Fuck that.
welcome to the majors.
it gets easier after the first one.
him.
Rafe.
not ready, bro?
I'll take care of this shit.

Aw, Jesus.
Jesus. Jesus.
Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
come on.
come on. Stop cryin' .
I haven't seen you around here before.
who are you?
Isiaha Charles. I just moved here with my mom.
who's he to you?
I just met him. He gave me a job.
Where'd you do time?
I've never done time.
you never did time? - No.
Oh, that is good shit.
you want some?
I'm good.
all right. This is how it's gonna work.
your buddy was smokin' crack and he got fuckin' crazy. . .
and he came at you with a knife.
now tell me what happened.
my buddy, he got fuckin' crazy. . .
and he came after me with a knife.
which is when Lazerov and I entered the domicile in response to a domestic disturbance. . .
and saw the defendant fire one round from a bulldog.
is this that bulldog You refer to? - Yes.
is this the knife You pried from the deceased's hand? / - Yes - What was he doing with him? - Something to stab the defendant.
now after the deceased deceased did the defendant resist?
no. - did he say anything?
he cried, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
cried? What do you mean he cried?
what do you mean he cried?
he cried. Jesus, Jesus.
that's enough.
Jesus. Oh my God. - That's enough, Officer Deed.
you may step down.
thank you.
that'll be a 10 minute recess. We'll reconvene at quarter past.
what the hell was that? - Testifying.
to the Second Coming? - Back off.
officer Deed?
officer Deed.
Yeah.
why'd he thank you? - Who are you?
Josh Pollack. Heights Herald.
the Jewish handout? - It's a community weekly.
the guy is Jewish? You're shittin' me.
I don't know he's Jewish.
and, what do you care?
you busted him in Ashtown, that's adjacent to the Heights.
tell our Jewish friends not to worry. They can still walk to worship.
so why'd he say thank you?
it's a manslaughter and possession beef.
it could've been murder. - So Why did FRAT catch this?
talk to public affairs.
officer Deed, can you tell me why FRAT is cruising the streets?
talk to public affairs.
guy thanked you?
jack-off. I hate that fuckin' guy.
who's that? - Wallace. Pussy.
Hey.
how'd court go, Frank?
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
something I should know? - No. Same old, Same old.
deed's first murder testimony.
Yep, weapons possession 18 months.
Rafe. Inspection Monday? Be sure you're there.
Pollack.
Pollack!
Pollack.
Yes, sir?
what are you doing?
article on the murder trial.
I told you to put the verdict on the police blotter.
that's a sentence, not a tome.
it's a legitimate story.
then find a legitimate paper to publish it.
all I want is the verdict, okay?
fraud.
sorry, did you say something?
no, sir. I didn't.
that's what I thought.
actually I said fraud.
did you now?
you know why The Times won't hire you Pollack?
you don't do the work.
a thousand words, not a single fact except for the verdict.
everything else is supposition.
frat wouldn't talk to me.
so the point of covert police work is not to talk about it.
this incident is public record, sir.
involving undercover police who like to keep a low profile, so they can sleep at night.
you can't imply nefarious activity because a felon whispered thank you to one of them.
I qualified it with a question.
you qualified. . .
watch my lips, son. You're not qualified to qualify.
nobody cares what you think.
only what you know and that's diddly 'cause you don't do the work!
unfortunate this is about as well written as you are uninformed.
you know what?
I think you should try novels. You're fired.
this isn't a real paper anyway.
perfect for you. Lazy little shit.
get out while you can.
shit.
Rafe. Don't make yourself crazy.
you're gonna give yourself a hernia.
come on. Let's go to bed.
you want the free range Chicken Kiev with potatoes or vegetables over risotto in a bell pepper sauce?
I'd like a meal prepared to order, not manufactured for distribution.
Ashford was right.
about what?
all this articulate conjecture wrapped around one fact.
Isiaha Charles, illegal weapons possession. / - Right.
8 words if you count the preposition. - Another critic.
you asked me to read it. - It was mistake.
because I agree with him?
come on, sweetie.
you know I thought being fired was the highlight of my day.
you're great sex.
but imperious and penniless are serious social handicaps and you should stick with your strengths.
I was hoping for sympathy.
poor baby.
well, that woulda worked.
Yeah, that's bullshit.
Rafe.
talk to me, please.
is It your headaches again? - Leave It alone, please.
I said I'm okay.
what's wrong with you? I'm worried.
I'm okay. I'm all right.
I'm gonna take a ride.
Rafe please, you need to get help.
he couldn't'a done better, believe me.
Hey, Rafe, what's up?
you're almost a no-show for inspection.
Oh, no no. I had dinner at Maria's.
I thought you were ending that.
I am gonna process ending it.
you can get inspected every day of the week, Rafe, if you need it.
but there are no exceptions.
I need your commitment.
I made my commitment. That's for sure.
all right. Let's go have some fun.
say hello to Marilyn. - Hey, Marilyn.
Hey, hero. The girls'll be happy to see you.
he's making me a little bit nervous.
you stalking me now?
I'm not lazy. - You're stoned.
and you are a vision of temperance.
this Is Cambodia. - It was Kampuchea at the time.
Wow. I knew you used to be somebody but - You're burying the lead, kid. - Come on man, I'm a good writer.
so what?
that builds strong papers.
and this story Is impor. . . - Pollack.
I don't publish stories.
I publish coupons for merchants who don't kidnap competition, bomb busses or immolate themselves.
am I wrong about the story? - What do I know?
help me get It right. - do the work.
I was in court, I took notes and tried to talk to FRAT.
talk to the defendant, huh?
he's in Longworth.
afraid to visit prison?
how am I talk to somebody who knows the defendant well.
how about visiting the scene of the crime, make an assessment.
okay.
you're right. - As if I need your affirmation.
I'm not telling you to do this. I'm telling you not to.
could be dangerous.
will you help me or not?
why the sudden urge to get this right?
my girlfriend read it.
agreed with you.
right. You're doin' this for pussy.
well I wouldn't put it that way. - For Pussy.
what happened to you?
don't talk to the system.
what the hell does that mean?
make up somethin' .
5: 52 a. m.
the call was for a D and D, domestic disturbance.
we knocked. Couldn't be heard over the shouting.
well the time, 5: 52 a. m.
there's no 5: 52.
no report that date and address.
filed by a Sergeant Francis Lazerov, or an Officer Raphael Deed.
frat files aren't public record. - Why?
we can't speak for FRAT. - Who can?
even if you were with a real paper I wouldn't talk to you. That's Policy.
it's public record, Captain Tilman.
it's trial and conviction. Not us, alright?
here we go.
if you're gonna turn every beef between two losers into headlines that's gonna seriously compromise our ability to social deviancy.
you know, we might as well pack it up and close shop.
screw John Q. Citizen. Is that what you want?
I don't think so.
have a good one.
bern ! - Sir.
it's Capt. Tilman, head of First Response Assault & Tactical Unit.
thanks a large part to this gentleman we're looking at an 82% reduction in homicides, 69 in felonies, 71 in sexual assault.
with those number we can have early intervention program.
in fact I see a day when we won't need courts at all.
Hi. - No, You Stay away.
no. I'm just looking for somebody. Ms. Melba Charles?
she lives here, right?
she's over there.
Oh, Jesus.
Isiaha Charles? I'm Josh Pollack, I'm a writer.
I was at your trial. - Oh, Yeah.
here.
listen.
after Officer Deed testified, you said thank you.
Why?
I can't talk about the trial.
can we talk about you?
who you were before this?
by the way, I'm very sorry about your mother.
what about my mother?
her stroke.
stroke?
you don't know. - Whoa, when?
a few days ago, I guess. - How bad of a stroke?
is my mother a vegetable?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Mama.
motherfuckers!
a'ight, look. You gotta get me outta here.
you gotta get me to my mother.
I can't. - No, You can.
if you get me out of here, I'll tell you everything you want about the trial.
I don't know how. - the way they capped Rook.
what? - Stole the crack, the 40 G's.
made up that shit about the knife. I'll tell you all of that.
ma. . .
I love you.
you hang on.
I'll be home soon.
I promise.
you get this to her. You promise me.
fuck!
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Charles.
ma, I love you. You hang on.
I'll be home soon. I promise.
you call me now? I'm not your personal editor.
just read this.
this is a Pulitzer.
what's it for?
blowing the judging committee. What do you think?
you saw Isiaha's arrest report?
copies of the court transcript.
no mention of cash, coke or guns? - No.
the emergency dispatch? - The copy's there.
there's no record of a 911 that time, date, address.
you talked to the District Attorney, the Public Defender, Judge.
you told me not to talk to the system.
what do you think?
it could dismantle the department when it's done.
what's missing?
the other side of the story.
they're murderers.
if you believe Isiaha Charles.
you won't publish it as is?
I won't publish it at all.
but The Times will if you get the department's side.
the department? They're murderers.
right. You're doing this for pussy.
I'm doin' it for this.
fourth estate, Pollack.
it's the only job protected by the Constitution, and this is why.
this is tyranny.
when you see it you're obligated to yell.
a risk you're unwilling to take, and I don't blame you.
in your new enlightenment I'll take you back to the Herald, but don't call yourself a jeranalist.
the coupon king has spoken.
good night, Pollack.
Oh, here, take this with you.
go on, leave. Leave.
go.
get the door. - got it.
you move, you die! Spread 'em! Spread 'em!
here. - Against the wall.
hey Deed !
I got somethin' for ya!
come on, baseball.
watch your step!
fuck.
shut up, gimme your other hand.
shut up. All right, let's go.
Bern, I owe you. . . anything

Laz. - Yeah.
take the girls out. I'm going downstairs.
party at my house. - Line up Here.
let's go. - Come on, sweetie.
come on. Come on.
here ya go, cupcake.
the fuck am I gonna do with this?
I thought you gave up muckraking, Moses.
it's Pollack's story.
you heard of anything like this, Levon?
sure all the time. From felons.
well, there it is.
D. A. 's office doesn't comment on unsubstantiated accusations.
why don't you come back when you have specifics?
we can't be more specific. - What are We talking about?
innuendo? Hearsay?
D. A. needs names. Otherwise the office can't respond.
Jack, when did you start referring to yourself as an inanimate object?
you run a community weekly Moses and I'll always have time for you but now that time is up.
Mr. Pollack.
Mr. Reigert. Mr. Wallace.
these aren't the good old days, Moses.
they never were, Jack.
why wouldn't you give him - Huh-uh.
if You were to just - Not now.
Ashford doesn't come here easily.
he didn't have anything specific or actual either.
ignore it. I'm not insulting Tilman with this.
Yeah, it's Jack.
can you come on over?
why weren't you more specific? - You have a source to protect.
I was that vague, you fired me.
do you know how pervasive this is?
are you think they're involved?
I don't know who's involved, and neither do you.
than why did we even come here?
Levon Wallace, city's best investigator.
if the story holds up he'll confirm it.
what do we do now?
I publish coupons. You should look for a job.
Mr. Ashford - Look, kid.
you've got a story, access to the D. A. and his best investigator.
if you can't make a career of that you don't belong in this business.
Mr. Ashford.
stop the Mister. Okay? I'm outta this game.
and your late night visits irk me.
if Wallace confirms your story, then you have to put the question to Tilman, Lazerov, and Deed.
use a phone. And pray they don't take the call.
Moses!
look, kid. It's Friday.
go do what you're supposed to do. Go get laid, for christ sake.
outta the way. - I wasn't doin' a thing.
Yeah, whatever.
look out. - All right!
Hey. Just here to dance.
have a good time.
what?
Oh, my God. . . poppy.
Pollack.
who's that? - He's a reporter.
we have to go.
Why? - We have to go.
that's the guy from your story. - Shh.
he's kinda cute, right?
are you dating other people?
don't worry. Looks like he just got engaged.
I saw that. Tough break for you.
you never put a face on it do you? Once published, it will ruin his life.
I'm not ruining his life.
I said your story. God, it is always about you, right?
I do think about that. Okay.
I think about ruining somebody's life.
you're not gonna get self-absorbed and mopey?
don't get all soft and mopey
Hey, what are you doing?
what happened? - Come on. Move it!
get outta the way!
move! Move!
don't move, help's comin' .
Aw, fuck.
officer Deed, Edison P. D. I have 2 down outside the Plaza Nightclub.
I have a medical bracelet here.
it says serum prothrombin conversion, blood type O.
stay still, buddy. Help's comin' .
she needs help. - I know. Stay still.
you okay?
Yeah.
hell. Shit.
Wallace?
you ever answer your fucking phone?
you?
I've been up all night.
Pollack got the shit kicked up last night, so did Willow.
what? Who?
his girlfriend. They're in the hospital.
how bad?
she's in a coma.
she's got factor seven deficiency. It's a blood disorder.
they don't know how she's gonna survive.
and Pollack?
took a beating but he'll be all right.
mugged?
warned.
who are you?
deed. Edison P. D. Who are you?
you don't wanna be here. - Who are you?
moses Ashford, I own the paper he works for.
how bad Is he? - He's banged up.
sedated. Do you care?
tell him somethin'? - Tell him What?
tell him I have nothing to do with this.
with What? - You gonna Tell him or not?
officer Deed.
is there any hope for you, son?
no.
let go.
what are you doin'? - Go me.
it's not safe for him here.
move him somewhere safe.
come in.
make yourself as comfortable as you can.
the market will deliver. It's on Wallace's tab.
you have run of the house, but, no matches.
no fire at All near the barn. - You told me.
all that dry hay could catch fire.
this place has been in Wallace's family for years.
why do I have to stay here?
you don't have to stay here. take a plane, go home to mommy.
I wanna be near Willow.
believe me, it's safer both of you if you're here.
when I publish.
you can't publish.
why not? - Look at what they did to me!
serious journalism doesn't look so good up close, huh?
it's a little hard to tell with this large thing hanging over my eye, thanks.
so who's a fraud now?
you know what? You don't even know what it's like.
life's a bitch, ain't it?
think you can swim, then it's oh shit, where are my water wings?
this isn't from swimming pool.
no, this is what you aspire to.
you want a prize? Here's your shot.
see when you asked Charles to tell you his story you committed.
now you have a moral duty. People depending on you.
[Man 1] All right, Coop. A hundred and five degrees.
what do you say? - [Cooper] 1 05? l can go more.
1 08. - [Cooper] l'm feeling it.
[Cooper] OK, the suspense is killing me.
all right, 1 1 0. - 1 1 0?
1 1 0. - A hundred and ten toasty ones.
right. Ready to go out and greet the heat?
the warm wind in my hair?
are you ready? - l'm ready.
let's do it. - Let's do it.
Thirty-one. Thirty-one degrees.
thirty-one below. - Thirty-one below! New record!
thirty-one below! - New record!
new record! Oh, it's cold!
l hate to do this, but...
rise and shine, kids. No more sleeping in.
all right. lf " rise and shine " won't work...
ls anybody hungry this morning?
[Whimpering] - Attaboy, Max.
Hey, what do you say? Ready for exercise before breakfast?
how you doing?
how does right field look?
l think it looks pretty good. What do you say, Max? Here we go.
go get it! - [barking]
Hey, Maya. - [grunting]
how's my best girl doing, huh?
how you doing?
you keeping everybody in line?
left field. Go get it.
left field, Maya. Here we go.
go get it! - [barking]
attaboy, Max. Come here, buddy.
settle down. There's plenty to go around, guys.
here you go, Shorty.
good boy, Shadow.
Dewey. Truman.
there you go, Old Jack.
that's my best girl. Here, l'll trade you.
there you go, Maya.
Hi. - Hey.
didn't think l'd see you this year. - Guess you got lucky.
l guess so. - Crazy Katie!
did you get your pilot's license yet? - Oh, Coop, l missed you.
got that? - Yeah. [grunts]
Hey, hey, careful with that.
that equipment's made it 1 0, 000 miles. l'd hate that to change in six feet.
sorry about that.
Hi. l'm Dr. Davis McClaren.
earth and Space Sciences UCLA.
Jerry Shepard, expedition guide. Welcome to the bottom of the world.
nice to meet you. - Same here.
go any further south, you'll fall off the planet.
well, that'd be unfortunate.
Charlie Cooper, cartographer, mechanical engineer, runway paver.
nice to meet you. - Dr. McClaren! Welcome to the ice.
Andy Harrison, NSF science director. An honor to meet you.
Dr. Rosemary Paris, field coordinator. - Nice to meet you.
you've met our team?
Yeah, Mr. Cooper was just taking good care of all my things.
Cooper, really? First time for everything, l suppose.
let's get you inside. - Thanks.
sure. - Yeah.
[Cooper] OK. Lady luck, in my corner.
[Katie] What are we playing? - [Cooper] She is pretty.
[Jerry] Quarter in. - [Katie] Quarter.
[Cooper] You're going down. - [Katie] You're going down.
crazy Katie, you're going down.
Hey, doc, you want in? - No, thanks.
l gave up gambling a long time ago.
Hey, you flew in with Katie, didn't you?
[Chuckling] - Remind me how you're getting home.
say, Old Jack, you in or out, buddy?
translation? - That'd be out.
so, Coop, how's the new girlfriend? - Mmm.
[Cooper] How's my new girl?
l don't know.
how about hot? - Wow.
[Rosemary] She's a scientist too. At the ltalian base.
pretty and smart. - Smarts.
Yeah. Notice something missing in that picture?
OK, OK. l think... l know you mean me.
you're talk... The picture's coming. She's sending one of the two of us, OK?
patience, Jer.
Uh-huh. How many? - [Katie] Two.
doc, you looking forward to your first trip to Dry Valleys?
lt's a pretty cool spot this time of year.
actually, Dr. McClaren needs to get to Mt. Melbourne to search for his meteorite.
melbourne, huh?
nobody said anything about Melbourne.
Yeah. Meteorite hunting is a pretty small world and, uh, l didn't want anybody to know where l was really going, 'cause l'm looking for something special at Melbourne and the NSF let us keep it off the paperwork.
ls there a problem?
look, doc, let me show you something.
l'll show you on the map.
this is where we are, right? OK. - Yeah.
[Jerry] Here's Dry Valleys.
all the way over here, Mt. Melbourne. Twice as far and the opposite direction.
l've been over our route twice in the last week, but l haven't been to Mt. Melbourne since the beginning of the season.
well, that may be so. But Dr. McClaren has traveled a long way.
lf we can accommodate him, we should. - Andy, it's the end of January.
the ice is too thin and snowmobiles would be too dangerous.
there's only one way to make that trip, with the dogs.
the dogs?
OK. Will they be able to carry all my gear?
the dogs'll be fine.
lt's really late in the season. - Last year we had the dogs out right up until the day we left.
all right, Andy. You're the boss. l'll get things ready.
Hey, you need some help? - No, l'm fine.
coop, say good night to Buck.
uh, l'm gonna take a rain check, Jer.
Ah...
kids, come on! Let's go! [whistles]
everyone outside. Let's get you tucked into bed. Come on.
good, Jack.
good boy. l'll see you in the morning.
Hey, Maya.
what do you say? One more trip, huh?
then we'll get you to McMurdo for the winter. That sound good?
huh? That sound good? That's my girl.
Hey, Max. l need a good trip out of you.
lucky star, huh? Let's hope so.
see you in the morning, Max.
knock, knock.
Hey. - Hey.
l warmed up some of your favorite ice cream.
strawberry. That's your favorite ice cream.
Yeah, well, you got here early. l didn't have time to go shopping.
uh, yeah, well, they changed things up.
how you been?
been a good season. Kids are doing well.
Maya's been awesome. Old Jack's getting a bit older, so...
Jerry, l was asking you how you've been.
l'm not interrupting or anything, am l?
no, Rosie. We were just catching up.
OK.
all right, well, uh...
l guess l'll see you guys in the morning, then.
thank you. That was sweet.
no problem. Good night.
good night.
pardon me. - Oh, sorry.
[McClaren] Oh! - [Cooper grunts]
Oh! Head's up.
sad fact of life in this place, doc. Floor is more comfy than the bunks.
so, what is it exactly that you do here?
cartography. l spent the last two years mapping every inch of this territory.
Hey, dude. What happened? You strike out?
no. l didn't even swing.
Ah, went down looking. That's still a strike-out, Jer.
Ow! Ow! - [Jerry] Sorry about that, buddy.
l didn't see you there.
we turn the heat off at night, so if there's anything you need to keep warm, l suggest you sleep with it.
lncoming.
Ow! Jerry!
[Chuckling] - [Cooper] Man!
[McClaren] OK, this is the last of it.
wow, doc. Won't be losing you, now, will we?
all right, rule number one.
lf you want to approach the dogs, approach them from the front. OK?
see how the lines are taut? - Yeah.
l want them like that at all times. lf the line's tangled, they'll fight.
we don't want that. - Got it.
anything else l should know? - The rest is pretty much up to me.
l gotta watch them. They're working dogs.
they'll run themselves to death. They love work.
all right, official introductions.
up here in front, on lead, we got my best girl, Maya.
next to her we got Old Jack.
just turned ten, and, uh, he's actually getting ready for retirement.
back here, the white one, this is Shorty.
and next to him is the pup of the bunch. That's Max.
he's still in training.
he's got the right stuff. l expect big things out of him.
right here, we got the twins. This is Truman.
truman took a bite out of Dewey a couple years ago.
notice the scar above Dewey's eye? - Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Well, they've been buddies ever since, so...
back here, last but not least, we got the two malamutes.
the gray one's Shadow and the red one's his buddy, Buck.
all brawn and absolutely no brain. But we love 'em.
everyone good to go this morning? - Yeah, l think so.
l was just being introduced to Maya, Old Jack,
shorty, Max, Truman, Dewey, Shadow and Buck.
[Harrison] Excellent. - [Katie] Jer?
be careful out there, OK? - Always.
take care of Cooper for me.
don't worry. l'll give him plenty of food and water.
OK, enough. Are we done?
l'd like a picture of our intrepid explorers, please. Thank you.
all right. Hang on! - [dogs whining, barking]
OK, you ready?
[Camera clicks] - Handsome. So handsome.
Hey, Coop. You'd better get up here and say goodbye to Buck.
Oh, yeah?
all right, uh, see you, Buck!
safe... Safe trip, Buck.
no. Come over and say goodbye. You're gonna give him a complex.
and what about my complex?
come around... Come say goodbye to him.
l'm... l'm pretty sure he heard me say goodbye, Jer. l don't...
OK. l don't know why you do this.
see ya, Buck.
all right. You, uh...
you take care of the doctor and, uh, Jerry, OK?
[Buck snorting] - Oh! Oh! Nasty!
Oh! That was disgusting!
l got dog spit all in my mouth and my nose!
lt's not funny. [belches]
l don't see what's so funny. [sniffling]
all right. Take care, guys. We'll see you.
Bye. - See ya.
[whistles] All right, team! Last hike of the season!
let's go! Hike! Hike!
come on, Jack! Come on, Old Jack!
let's go, Maya! Come on, girl!
[McClaren] Whoa! Whoa!
[Jerry] Whoa! Whoa!
[McClaren] What's the problem?
we got ice fields up ahead. l don't know how thick the ice is.
that's why we couldn't take the snowmobiles. Look.
so, what do we do?
l'm gonna change things up.
put the dogs in a fan formation for safety.
lt's a little slower, but it spreads the weight out.
that way if one of the dogs falls through the ice, the lead's long enough so the rest don't follow.
[whistles] Hike! -[barking]
[Jerry] Hey, doc.
you see that over there? - What is that?
here.
[grunting] - [Jerry] You see 'em?
[McClaren] l see 'em. What are they? - Leopard seals.
more leopard than seal, if you ask me.
give 'em a wide birth? - Yeah, we'll give 'em some space.
[Rumbling] - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
whoa, kids! Whoa!
what was that? - We're on a glacier now.
we're gonna have to take her slow, doc. Get off.
l want you to take the brake. You're gonna run the sled. All right?
heavy brake.
follow my footprints. Keep the sled on my footprints.
l'll probe ahead. - Got it.
this glacier's always moving, so we have to be careful.
all right, doc. Keep two feet on the brake if you need to.
just keep a steady go, all right? - All right.
all right, kids, come on! Easy, now!
nice and easy. Let's go.
all right, stop! Stop!
all right, hard brake, right there!
[Jerry] We got a crevasse right here.
l'm not sure how big it is, so we're gonna go around. OK.
we're gonna bring it over this way. Slow and easy.
l'm gonna call Maya over, and then l just want you to let up ever so lightly, all right?
all right, got it. - All right, Maya, haw! Haw!
haw! Haw!
Max, what are you doing?
Max, no. Haw!
Max! Stop! Stop, Max! Doc, stop!
[grunting] - No!
hold on, doc! - [grunting]
doc! Put both hands on the sled! Both hands on the sled, doc!
Hike! Come on, Jack, take it home!
come on, Maya, take her home!
come on! Hike!
Oh, man!
you OK?
[Panting] Yeah.
do me a favor.
next time you decide to go to Melbourne, don't pack so much stuff.
and try coming a bit earlier.
Andy said the trip was fine. You agreed to go.
Andy's my boss. l do what he says.
lf you didn't think it was safe, you shouldn't have backed down.
[Jerry] Easy. - [whining]
Jerry, thanks for today.
Yeah. No problem.
who's the artist?
my son, Eric.
he does one every trip.
[Jerry] He looks like your wife.
lucky kid.
Yeah.
what about you? You got somebody?
are you kidding me?
l'm here six months a year dragging scientists around.
what kind of woman would put up with that?
how about Katie? Looked like you might've had something.
Yeah. A couple years ago we did.
you know how it goes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
l guess relationships don't fit my lifestyle.
anyhow, come on. Let's go outside, guys.
we're gonna get an early start tomorrow. Come on. [whistles] Come on, Max.
come on, Max. [whistles]
all right, whoa!
doc, hold it. Put on the brake, l'm gonna take it from here.
Yeah, got it. Whoa!
what do you say?
[McClaren] That's something else. - That's Melbourne.
that's your home for the next week. - Beautiful.
[Jerry] Ready, now! Hike!
[Man over radio] Victoria, this is McMurdo Weather. Come in.
Victoria? This is McMurdo Weather.
this is Victoria. We copy you, Mactown.
Hi, Andy. It's Steve. Just checking status on your team.
we've got four at the base and two in the field. Over.
suggest you bring them in.
we have two massive low pressure systems moving south.
control wants you in early just to be safe. Over.
copy that, Mactown. Over and out.
get Jerry on the radio.
wanna sling me a cup of that when you get a chance?
Yeah, sure thing.
you got her? - Yeah, thanks.
how's that looking there?
well, everything points to the spot that we're on.
the next couple days are gonna tell us a lot.
[Katie over radio] Field base to Melbourne. Come in.
base to Melbourne. Come in.
Jerry, do you read me? Over.
Yeah, go for Melbourne. That you, Katie?
Jerry, we got a call from Mactown.
[Radio static] - ...major storm coming in. Over.
you'll have to go again. We're in a bad spot here.
Jerry... back to field base. Do you copy?
we got a major storm coming in. Mactown wants you in right away. Over.
all right. Copy that. We'll be back.
when do we expect this storm?
sorry, doc. Looks like we're gonna have to pack up.
well, when do we have to leave? - We leave first thing, tomorrow.
listen, Jerry... - You heard what she said.
now, Jerry, look. l cannot go back without at least trying.
Yeah, well, that's not your call.
no. lt's not.
there's a major storm coming in, all right?
not a minor one, but a major.
down here there's a big difference between the two.
my job as your guide is to get you back home in one piece, and that's exactly what l'm gonna do.
but Jerry, we're talking about a rock from another world.
this ice floe might give us the first meteorite from the planet Mercury.
that could lead us to discoveries we can't imagine.
when you climb a mountain, go up a river, the exciting part isn't what you know is there. lt's what you don't know.
lt's what you might find, and it's the same here.
l came halfway around the world to look for something that's important to me.
Jerry, please, you...
you gotta take chances for the things you care about.
half the day on the east slope.
but l want to be back on that sled tomorrow by noon.
l'll take that. l'll take that.
no.
Hey, we're running out of time here, doc.
[McClaren] Believe me, l know.
Hey, Jerry.
l think we got something here. - Hey, wait, doc!
doc, wait a minute. Doc, don't move.
you're outside the safety zone.
this is a big one. Eleven centimeters across, fully intact.
lt looks like a basalt, but it's like nothing l've ever seen.
Jerry! - Doc! Doc, don't move.
that area's unchecked. l told you to stay inside the flags.
Oh, my God. [laughing] This is it!
great, doc. Stay still.
l'm glad you found your rock, but let's get you out of there.
just follow your footsteps out. Step right in your footprints.
man, l knew l could find it! Huh? What'd l tell you? This is it.
half a day! Thank you.
now that you scared the hell out of me, can we go home now?
Yeah. - All right. Let's go.
[Steve over radio] Victoria, this is Mactown. Come in.
victoria here. We copy you, Mactown.
[Steve] The approaching storm has picked up speed and intensity.
we are sending you the coordinates. Mactown out.
[Harrison] Copy that, Mactown. Over and out.
field base to Melbourne. Come in.
whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Easy there, team! Easy.
what's up?
l got to do a patch job on one of the kids.
radio Katie. See what's going on with that storm.
all right.
Ah, shoot. Looks like it's Old Jack.
come here, Jack.
field base, come in. - [static]
field base, come in. - All right.
we'll get you fixed up. - Field base?
got something in your paw?
this is Melbourne team calling.
field base, can we get a...?
doc!
are you OK? - [groaning]
l think l've broken my leg.
all right. All right, stay right there. l'll be right back!
Whoa! - [rumbling, cracking]
Whoa! Wait, doc! Don't move! - [cracking]
doc! Doc!
doc! Hey! Don't tread water!
don't tread water!
look at me! You see the ice? Davis.
grab the ice! lt'll freeze you to it!
lt takes you a lot longer to freeze than it does to drown!
good, good! Davis, hang on! l'm coming down!
all right, kids, come on!
hang on, doc!
Maya, come here. - [gasping]
l can't... l can't breathe. l can't breathe.
take deep breaths, doc.
Maya, take the rope.
go to doc.
she's coming to you, doc. She's coming to you.
OK, Maya, down.
good girl. Crawl to the doc.
come on, Maya, l got you. lt's OK.
[gasping] - Come on, doc, stay in there with me.
come on, Maya.
easy, Maya. Easy.
good girl.
good job, Maya. Put the line over him.
good girl. Doc.
keep your left arm on the ice, like it is, but l want you to reach up with your right arm.
you gotta get your elbow and your arm up through the loop.
you can do it. There you go.
good job, doc. Yeah, just like that.
all right. Maya, come on.
good girl, Maya. Good girl.
l got you, doc. l got you.
keep it tight.
line 'em up, Maya!
right now! Right now! Come on! Take it home!
line up! Hike!
[barking] - Come on, Maya! Come on, Old Jack!
come on, kids! [straining]
Hike! [straining]
all right, doc, you hang in there, OK?
we're gonna get you home. All right?
don't you worry. [coughing]
l'm gonna get you back. - l'm sorry.
you're gonna get home and see your family, doc.
you're gonna see your son, all right?
come here, Maya.
Maya, you got to get us home! Get us home!
go get up there, Max! Maya needs you!
right now! Right now! Hike! Hike!
l can fly in this, Andy. You know l can.
sorry, Katie. lt's not a question of whether you could fly in it, but whether you could see anything.
don't worry, hon. He's been in worse before.
[Cooper] Worse than this?
what? - [sighs]
[Katie] Base to Melbourne team. Come in?
base to Melbourne. Come in.
this is Katie. Please, come in. - [static]
Jerry, do you copy? Over. - [static]
[Sighs] Base out.
[coughing] Good, kids.
[Harrison] About three here, right?
Andy! Coop! Come on, they're here!
Jerry! Jer, are you all right?
he's got a broken leg! And he's been in the water!
get the stretcher now! - Got it!
l don't like that cough. - Get the dogs.
[Andy] Look at those hands! Get him in!
[Katie] Come on, Jerry. - Let's go!
[Jerry coughing] Good team. Good team.
good girl, Maya! - [barks]
[Jerry] You got us home. [coughing]
all right, let's have a look at this leg.
[Jerry coughing] - [Harrison] Rosemary. Hypothermia kit.
put your hands in there. We'll bring 'em back nice and slow.
Hey. Buddy, how you feeling?
how are the dogs? - Uh, good. l just fed them.
get the rock off the sled too. - The rock?
he found what he was looking for? - Of course. He had a good guide.
soon as you can, get that plane ready.
Dr. McClaren could lose this leg without proper medical attention.
what are we gonna do about the dogs? - There's only so much we can carry.
l did speak to Mactown. The winter team is ready to go.
Katie can fly right back, bring the dogs out.
l'll wait here and, uh, l'll fly out with the dogs later.
no, that's out of the question. That could be stage three frostbite and heaven knows what nerve damage has already been done.
Jerry, he's right. l'll come right back. l promise.
let's get ready to pull out of here.
[Harrison] Take them out.
[Cooper] Watch his head. Jer. l need some help.
[Harrison] Be careful with that leg.
[Harrison] Knock down the stretcher, Rosemary.
coop. Coop, come help me tighten the dogs' collars so they don't get loose. Come on. Max! Come on!
good boy, Max. [coughing]
come on, buddy. Come here.
come here, Max. Come here, Max.
[Cooper] Come here. - [Jerry] Good boy. Good boy, Max.
[Cooper] All right. Here we go. - [Jerry] Won't be long.
[Cooper] Easy, Max. Easy.
[Jerry] Let's get the other ones. - [Cooper] All right.
hang in there, big guy. - [barks]
that's the last of 'em.
all right, Maya.
you keep 'em in line, all right, and l'll be back. l promise.
be good. That's my girl!
all right, buckle tight. This one's gonna be rough.
coop, l know you got that fear... - Major... major fear of flying? Yeah.
Ugh.
Hey.
Hey!
finally.
Oh, man.
Oh, you... you are so lucky you passed out.
we... [sighs]
we were bouncing around up there, man, like one of those beach balls at Dodger Stadium.
and Katie was yelling at me the whole time to stop screaming, but, uh, l couldn't do it. lt was way too intense, man.
lt was crazy.
where is everybody?
right here. Everyone's here at Mactown.
Davis is good. Uh, you're good.
your hands... You still have your hands, which is good.
everything's... everything's all good, man.
did Katie get the dogs OK?
Yeah, well, um...
uh... [clears throat]
uh... [clears throat] No.
they were telling her that-that she should wait, maybe, you know, until things got better.
Jer? lt's been snowing since we got here, man.
dude...
Hey. You're finally up.
how are your hands feeling? - They're fine.
how soon can we go back? - l think you should get some rest, OK?
no, Katie. How soon?
the weather's gotten worse. No one's flying in.
when is it gonna get better?
they've canceled the winter teams. No one's going in till spring.
[Woman] l need it now!
excuse me, commander?
who are you? - Jerry Shepard. l'm with NSF.
Andy Harrison's crew? - Yeah.
we need a plane to the field base. We weren't entirely evacuated.
what? l ordered everybody out of there yesterday.
no, not everybody. We left eight dogs there, sir.
dogs?
l've got over 200 people, ten winter teams to evacuate to New Zealand.
right. These dogs are a part of our team, NSF.
captain, we've got a big problem with some of the engines icing up.
we have to start moving some planes. - Son, look. This is today.
we've got a two-day window, then another storm hits.
lf it lasts till here, which they say it will, then we're into winter and nobody flies.
we don't have enough supplies to keep everybody here.
so l'm a little busy right now. - All we need is a plane, sir...
[Man] Do you want us to do that, sir? - Do what?
start moving some planes. - Will you give me one minute?
listen. lf we could just get a plane like the one that we flew in on, it would only take three hours.
son, the only thing we've got left are C-1 30s and they sure as hell can't land at a field base.
we can't just leave 'em out there.
there's nothing l can do. l'm sorry.
let's start moving those planes. - [man] Yes, sir, right away, captain.
[Knocking] - Yeah, come in.
Hey.
how we doing?
when's your flight leave? You and Rosie?
a couple hours ahead of you, Coop and the doc.
Jerry, l'm so sorry.
l'm really sorry, Jerry.
l don't want to talk about it. You want a drink?
sure.
fresca. - Yeah, sorry. That's all l got.
[Sighs] You know this wasn't your fault. This wasn't anybody's fault.
we just left 'em there. - Come on. We didn't just leave them.
don't do this to yourself. The dogs are strong.
maybe there's a chance.
we tightened their collars so they wouldn't get loose.
listen, l...
l know...
l know you want me to find a way to get us back there somehow.
l know you're disappointed in me.
no.
you know, sometimes you just have to lower your expectations.
you know what, Jerry? l'm sorry. l really am.
l've got to go pack.
fill this out. Take it down to admin. Just follow the red line on the floor.
with any luck, you could have some funding by August.
August?
no, wait. l don't think you understand. ln a few days those dogs...
l have to go now.
l'm sorry, Mr. Shepard. Once winter sets in, as you know, there's no coming or goings down there.
we had to cancel the winter teams this year.
couldn't get 'em in before the storm. - There must be somebody going south.
Mr. Shepard, be reasonable. This is the biggest Antarctic storm in 25 years.
lf you don't believe me, take a look at this weather report.
[Doorbell rings] - [McClaren] Yeah, good, good.
Where's the rocket going? - [woman] What a surprise!
to Mars, Dad. - [woman] Come on in.
yeah?
[Woman] Well, look who l found.
Hey. Hey, world traveler.
how you been? - l'm good, l'm good.
how's your fingers? - Oh, l get to keep 'em.
great. - How's the leg?
hard to tell. The cast is coming along great, thanks to Eric.
there's a pot of coffee in the kitchen, so...
Eric, let's go find a real coloring book.
what a great surprise. - Give you a hand?
no, l'm all right. - You got it?
so, what brings you to LA?
l brought you something.
Thanks.
l gotta get back there. Right now.
l can't sleep at night. l've been to NSF, agencies, foundations.
l've been to TV networks to convince them to follow me with a camera.
anything to raise money. lt just... lt all takes too long.
now l've only got one week to get back down there before winter hits.
then no one gets in for six months. You've got those guys in your pocket.
the, uh, the science fund guys.
the university endowment? - They'd do anything for you right now.
Jerry, listen to what you're saying. - No, it would just be me, just a three-day trip in. You could tell 'em.
tell 'em l'm scouting your next trip. - They'd be throwing their money away.
no, they wouldn't. - Even if you could get down there, - by now it's 50 below. - No.
Jerry, be realistic. lt's already been...
l know how long it's been.
but l need to know for sure. l have to go.
lt's not possible, Jerry.
lt's just not possible.
and you gotta find a way to forget about all this.
forget?
and you can do that?
there was another colony, 30 miles from Plymouth.
it's not on the maps today. Merrymount.
Ah, right, you mentioned in your book, the colony where anything goes... went.
there was booze...
there was booze, fornication, there was music...
they even...
you name it...
they even danced round the Maypole once a month, wearing masks, worshiping god knows what, Whites and Indians together all going for broke.
who was responsible for all of this?
a character by the name of Thomas Morton.
Ah... The Hugh Hefner of the Puritans.
you can say that.
I will read you a quote of what the Puritans thought of.
Morton's followers.
debauched aliens and atheists falling into great licentiousness and leading degenerate lives.
when I heard that, I packed my bags, I left Oxford, I came straight to America.
america the licentious.
so what happened to all of those people?
the Puritans shut them down. They sent in Miles Standish, leading the militia, who chopped down the Maypole, cut down those coloured ribbons, banners, everything. The party was over.
and we became a nation of strait-laced Puritans.
well...
isn't that your point though?
the Puritans won.
they stamped out all things sexual. How would you say?
sexual happiness. - Exactly.
until the 1960's.
until the 1960's, where it all exploded again all over the place, right, everyone was dancing around the Maypole, then, "make love, not war."
if you remember, only a decade earlier,
if you wanted to have sex, if you wanted to make love in the 1950s, you had to beg for it, you had to cop a feel or get married.
as I did in the 1960's.
any regrets?
plenty.
but that's my secret.
don't tell anybody.
that's just between you and me.
I think it was Bette Davis who said:
old age is not for sissies.
but it was Tolstoy who said that "the biggest surprise in a man's life is old age."
old age sneaks up on you, and the next thing you know you're asking yourself, I'm asking myself, why can't an old man act his real age?
how is it possible for me to still be involved in the carnal aspects of the human comedy?
because, in my head, nothing has changed.
her name was Consuela Castillo and she was my student.
this course is called "Practical Criticism."
so... Let's go!
right to the big question, shall we?
does "War and Peace" become a different book because we read it?
Yes, of course. But why?
because we bring something to the book?
we bring ourselves.
what's more, if you read the book again in 10 years, it will change again, because you've changed.
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I've always been vulnerable to female beauty,
ms. Castillo was different, her posture was perfect.
and she dressed like a young associate of a prestigious law firm. There was a sophistication, that set her apart.
she knows she's beautiful.
but she's not yet sure what to do with her beauty.
no, don't take notes. Because honestly, it's not worth it.
really, don't give it a thought.
a work of art reminds you of who you are now.
since they posted the sexual harassment hotline number down the hall from my office, I never make private contact with any of my students until they've received their grades.
and it's always a success.
professor Kepesh, we saw you on TV last night.
you were great.
thank you. Charlie Rose was pretty good too, wasn't he?
well, yes.
you were great.
have a lovely evening. - Thank you.
it's a colossus of perspective. It depends on who's observing, right professor Kapesh?
westerners see Islamic integralists as primitive and dangerous while Islamic integralists see Americans as depraved and corrupt.
nothing's changed since the crusades. We need an alliance of civilizations...
ms. Castillo. - Hi, professor.
is this a real letter from Kafka? - Yes.
Yes, it's one of the original letters that he wrote to Milena. It was a gift from someone.
someone close to you.
someone who was close to me, Miss Castillo.
Consuela.
we're not in class. We don't need to be so formal.
Consuela.
do you play the piano? - Yeah.
would you play for us?
too many people. I'd freeze.
you know there's something about you that invites a kind of formality.
what do you mean?
you have a kind of elegant austerity.
austerity?
something like that.
well, I guess I got that from my father.
he is austere and proud. Very Cuban.
Cuban?
my whole family is Cuban.
I was 11 years old when I came.
did you go straight to college from high school?
no, I was a legal secretary in a law firm.
you worked.
I tried it, but I didn't like it.
my parents always hoped I would go to college,
so I made up my mind and here I am.
I want to show you something.
here we are. - Goya.
what's this one called? - "La Maja Vestida."
And?
And? - She resembles you.
you resemble her.
Really?
Yes.
I think so.
what do you think?
I don't know.
the eyes, maybe.
why all this talk about Kafka, Goya and her Cuban family?
don't get me wrong, it's great that her family's Cuban and she enjoys my class.
but I go on yakking away mainly because I want to fuck her.
what can I say? - True.
the room is full of spies.
I love music.
excuse me.
I love opera, my grandfather takes me to the Opera,
and I adore theater.
I review plays for a magazine.
would you like to go with me sometime to the theater?
Yes. - Sorry.
go to the theater?
why don't you take her to the prom? - I get it.
this girl is...
she's a throw-back to a completely different time. She has to be wooed.
I thought we were talking about sex.
you know for a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, sometimes you display a remarkable lack of imagination.
that's why they gave me the fucking prize.
don't tell me you've never been through the process of talking the talk.
that's why I have a family for Christ's sake. I talk to them.
maybe you should get married again.
George!
talk the talk with your wife if you feel like it, go to the museums, look at all the Goyas that you want, but keep the sex part just for sex.
alright.
do you really still talk to your wife, George?
no. One all.
I'm not hitting that.
sneaking off for a smoke?
you know you shouldn't smoke. - You tell me that in this bed, every 3 weeks.
I'm under a lot of pressure. - I like to be consistent.
so do I.
you've been trying to get me to quit smoking for 20 years.
since the first day of your class.
Oh my God, your class made me smoke.
I'm under a lot of stress.
Oh, how was Chicago? - Cleveland.
Chicago was last week. Atlanta's next week.
you sound like Cary Grant in "North by Northwest." Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha!
ha ha, laugh, just try being a woman running your own business.
I thought you liked being your own boss.
I do. Oh, I do, I do.
thank god for these little interludes.
that's all I can say.
aren't you going to get that?
there's only one person in the world that would call me at 2 o'clock in the morning
leave a message.
did you get my email? I really need to talk to you.
Ah, I should have known better than to think you'd be home at this hour.
or maybe you are home and listening to this, all snug and smug.
35 years old and he still hates my guts.
well, you ran out on him.
I ran out on a marriage that I got myself into out of youth and fear a million years ago.
sometimes you pay for liberation.
that's the price he pays for being turned into the heroic defender of the abandoned mother.
I mean if any one of us could make it over the wall.
he sat on my case, isn't there some statute of limitations? I've tried.
really, I've tried.
when he was 12 or 13, one time, he came to spend the summer with me, I took him to the Mets.
he spent the next five innings throwing up in the men's room, he's been throwing up ever since, that phone call was him throwing up.
you know what's wild?
he's successful.
Kenny Kepesh, a well respected doctor, my son, the doctor.
he speaks passable French. He's married with children.
it's only with me that he regresses to what you just heard.
I'm sorry, he gets me going.
I thought you stopped reviewing plays.
well, that one looked kind of interesting.
too bad. I'm going to be in Atlanta.
I'll go with George.
religion, family,
church, self-help books.
men with teeth so white, you'd think there's a flashlight in their mouths.
love, especially romantic love.
flowers, mini-malls.
there is nothing more depressing than a mini-mall.
mini-malls. - Except perhaps your flaws, your vices, your mortgages, your furtive looks to your sleeping BlackBerry - I do like blackberries. - And this man, who finds himself here, dandruff falling of his head.
that was wonderful.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
thank you.
you'd like to go somewhere for a drink?
we don't have to...
I'm just not used to being out with a celebrity.
talking about literature on public television once a week, and writing the occasional review for the New Yorker, doesn't make me much of a celebrity.
don't forget your history books "The Origins of American Hedonism."
look, if you don't like the idea of being stared at, we can go to my place.
then the only person staring would be me.
if I go to your place, will you do something for me?
that was awful.
it was OK. That was amazing.
I wish I could play.
take lessons.
you'd enjoy playing. If you knew, you wouldn't have such a high opinion of my playing.
now you're fishing for compliments.
is this a metronome?
it's like a heart beat.
even great pianists have a problem with their core acceleration.
you're a very charming man.
you know, don't you?
if this is all for showing you a metronome, I swear I didn't invent it.
can you find anyone that enchanting without sex?
nobody.
what is this?
my dark room.
I used to develop my own pictures.
you don't anymore? - No, no time.
I should go digital, but I can't really understand that stuff.
of course you can.
thank you.
something relates little princess because she's the center of the picture, not her parents, the queen and the king.
they are just ghostly reflections in the mirror.
well, she must have been curious about going to bed with you.
Yes, so she could tell her girlfriends what a man of our age, is like, close up.
I'm merely an experience for her. One of many to come.
she'll remember me as the old guy who gave her some culture on the way.
well, that sounds about right.
you should chalk it up to the same thing, right?
Yeah.
gotta stop worrying about growing old.
worry about growing up.
Oh, thank your lucky stars for such a one-shot encounter.
it wasn't a one-shot encounter.
she came back for more?
you have the most beautiful breasts I've ever seen.
you like them?
I worship them.
and you have a beautiful face, I can't stop looking at.
you know something?
you're a work of art.
a work of art.
a real work of art.
let's talk about you.
have you had many women?
Why?
more than 50 or less?
more.
who's counting?
how about you?
not many.
how many?
five.
five boyfriends.
five.
five.
I see.
so, who were they?
they were young, right? Younger than me?
of course they were younger. They were boys.
boys?
sure.
you want to know the most extreme thing I ever did?
hmm well...
once I went to bed with two guys together.
two together?
they were my childhood friends and that's how we ended up one night.
the three of us were drunk and we ended up in bed together.
all three of you?
well, when you're 17, you do a lot of things just to feel secure and emotional.
right.
Consuela.
my whole life was dedicated to independence and at some cost I had achieved my goal.
nevertheless, it was in that moment, that my terrible jealousy was born.
that is when I realised that I would never, ever, really possess her.
I feel anxious unless I speak to her on the phone every day, and then I feel anxious after we've spoken.
what are you wearing?
where are you?
I knew it's only a matter of time before a young man found her and took her away.
I knew.
because I was once that young man who would have done it.
well, at least does it makes you feel young?
it's like playing soccer with a bunch of 20 year olds.
it doesn't make you feel 20 because you're playing with huge difference, every second of the game.
you have to leave her.
your hands will always be tied by this girl.
she's going to leave you sooner or later, anyway.
so it's always better to keep one step ahead.
take her to a nice romantic spot tell her it's over.
that's what I'd do.
my parents talk about all these places they wanted to go to.
they have all the money to go wherever they want, but leaving Cuba was their first and last trip.
I don't want my life to be like that.
let me take you places.
what the hell are you saying? You brought her here to say goodbye.
where would we go? - Europe.
we could go to Paris this summer, or Rome, or Madrid.
we can visit the Prado and see the real Velasquez, the real Goya.
the Prado?
do you mean it?
of course I meant it.
and we can finish our trip in Venice, you'll love Venice.
and you would ride a gondola with me. - Maybe.
maybe.
"maybe" may be your favorite word.
I'll sing to you in the gondola.
we'll see.
what's this from:
they're making a beast with two backs." What's that from?
william Shakespeare!
Othello, The Moor of Venice."
and we're making a monster with four legs.
where shall we have dinner?
I can't. I'm going out tonight.
you are? With whom? - With my brother.
we're going to go dancing to that place "Kalimas."
your brother...?
you never mentioned a brother.
well, there is a lot of things you don't know about me yet.
thank you.
here we are.
I really had a great time with you today.
me too.
thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
are you really going out with your brother tonight?
David!
that was a joke.
Bye.
on the nights she isn't with me, I am deformed, thinking of where she might be.
and all this because this girl will tell me a thousand times how much she adores me and means it.
this girl will never once tell me she yearns for my cock.
how are you?
what are you doing here?
I was on my way to see a friend, who lives near here. How's things?
what's the matter?
did you came here to check on me? - I told you.
I was down in the neighborhood and I saw this place.
do you want to ruin everything?
no.
so then you're going to have to start trusting me.
I'll call you tomorrow.
no, I'll call you.
I never behaved like such an idiot even when I was her age.
good thing is, at least now, it's finished, she won't want to see me anymore. I understand her.
I mean, even I wouldn't want to see me anymore if I was her.
maybe it's just as well.
Yes. - Just as well.
Oh, my God.
Hello?
David, it's Consuela.
during the last two days, I've been thinking a bit about us.
have you?
Yes.
and what were you thinking?
that it's all over.
what do you really want from me?
what do I really want from you?
you spend you whole life going through relationships without ever really bonding with anyone.
so, at least I would like to know, who I am for you.
the fact that you're jealous and possessive doesn't help me, at all.
even little kids are jealous of their toys until they get tired of them.
and want new ones. So is that how it's going to be between us two?
have you ever imagined a future with me?
a future with you scares me.
it scares you? - Yes.
Why?
and you have your whole life ahead of you.
it's just a matter of time before you realise it too.
I didn't ask you what I was going to do. I asked what you wanted to do with me.
when you make love to a woman, you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life.
I spent my whole life jumping from one relationship to another, because this made me believe that I was never alone, and that time was not passing.
I've always surmised, for example, "Who am I for you?," she asked me one day.
I was to afraid to ask who I was for her.
how long could it have lasted?
surprise.
Yes. Let me... wow!
thank God for Carolyn.
Carolyn is my only point of contact with the self-confident man I used to be.
how was that play?
which play?
the one you took George to.
Oh, unremarkable, just...
here I go.
Oh, hit and run.
just the way you like it.
good thing I don't have pets.
only you.
which one was Carlos Alonzo?
from high school. - What was his thing?
what did he want you to do?
he liked to watch me menstruate.
what?
he liked to watch me menstruate. - I don't believe this.
the respectable Cuban-American girl whose parents worship Ronald Reagan, who enforce an 8 o'clock curfew on their daughter in summer time, no less, there she is in high school, aged 15...
I'm so sorry. That makes all the difference.
I think you're being ridiculous. - How did you manage it?
David...
I'm really curious. What do you do?
you find yourself having your period, pick up a phone, you ask him to come over?
hey Carlos, I'm starting.
and then he appears, all Cuban and "respectable,"
and the pair of you retire to the bathroom where you have the ceremony of the pulling down of the tampon.
Yeah, it's just like you were there.
just filling in the missing... just filling in the blanks.
which blanks?
five. Now we're down to 3.
because of the two guys who...
I have to go, sorry.
what is this?
what? - This.
you're fucking other women.
I had two husbands who fucked other women.
I didn't like it then, I don't like it now, least of all with you.
you have everything with me David. Pure fucking.
no hidden agendas, no icky entanglements.
how could you do this? There aren't many like me.
I actually understand you.
I am one in a million.
how could you possibly fuck...?
I don't know whose that is.
why don't you put it on a bagel and eat it.
I have a pretty good idea.
I'm sure you do.
you know my friend George O'Hearn, the poet?
george uses tampons? Since when?
no, listen. George has the keys to this apartment. He gives poetry readings, he meets girls.
he can't bring them home, to his wife in New Rochelle.
and since he's always short on funds...
and since some of them are married... - George fucks all these women in your bed?
not all, some. He uses the bed in the guest room.
his marriage isn't paradise.
probably a bit like mine and he wasn't desperate enough to get out.
I don't believe a fucking word you're saying.
everything in your life is so meticulous.
it's so orderly... - I don't know whose tampon this is.
you have to believe me.
you're all I'm holding on to.
in this at least I was telling the truth.
of course the whole situation was ridiculous.
do I snore?
yes? - It's worse.
what?
well...
you drool.
Yes.
you drool on... - Not true!
you drool in your sleep.
beautiful women are invisible.
invisible? What the hell does that mean?
invisible.
they jump out at you. A beautiful woman stands out... stands apart. - You can't miss her. - But we never actually see the person.
we see the beautiful shell.
we're blocked by the beauty barrier.
look at you.
what?
what did you say?
you're deaf, Mr. Kepesh. - No. What?
or maybe you do not want to hear.
maybe that's the problem with you.
Yes. We're so dazzled by the outside. We never make it inside.
do you always work in black and white?
mainly. I like the theatricality.
is that how you see the world?
in black and white?
no.
that distinction belongs to my son.
you always speak of him with such bitterness.
in my family, that would be so strange.
take a look.
beautiful picture.
beautiful woman.
look, my hands are huge.
I want you so much.
David...
your fridge is empty.
if we are staying in, we have to go shopping.
excuse me, Professor, but your Spanish is awful.
then teach me. - Yeah, I'll teach you.
I'll teach you "tomorrow."
isn't that your poet friend? - Keep walking.
that woman is not his wife? - That's right.
I find that disgusting. - It isn't our business.
and that's the end of it? - Let's not discuss it here.
are you OK with that? - With what?
for all you know he's just having a cup of coffee with a friend.
you know, you're jumping to conclusions.
David, being younger than you doesn't make me a child.
in any event, it's not our business.
you keep saying that, but what do you think about it?
what I think is that marriage is a problematic institution at best.
which is why you married your wife.
which is why I don't cheat on her.
but you were married once. - Yes, yes! Yes! Yes!
what do you want me to say?
I was married.
it was a mistake.
did you try?
did you really try? Where I come from...
I know, where you come from the rules are different, but they're not.
you're such a cynic.
I'm such a realist.
I think you're just infantile.
I'm sure you're right.
I hung in there for over a year. It was a real roller coaster ride.
and like all rides, sooner or later, it has to end.
what are you doing a week from Sunday?
I don't know. Why?
something to drink?
Yeah, two Bellinis, please. - Okay.
what's a week from Sunday?
my parents are throwing me a graduation party, to celebrate my MFA.
I'd like you to come.
David...
everyone knows about you.
for a whole year and half they've been asking me about this mystery man I'm seeing.
they're going to start thinking I'm with some drug dealer, if you don't stop hiding.
I'm not hiding.
you didn't come to my birthday. - Well you didn't ask me.
I asked you to Christmas dinner with my parents. You had plans.
then I invited you to Thanksgiving dinner, you couldn't come.
whoa, Thanksgiving I really couldn't.
David...
huh?
I want you to meet my family.
but I'm not going to insist.
I just want you to say yes because you want to come.
here we go. - Thanks.
enjoy.
listen to me.
listen to me.
when I come to your party, you have to promise to do something.
what?
don't take your eyes of me when the Cubanates come stampeding towards me.
that's all?
that's all.
okay.
so...
that means yes? - That means yes.
okay.
I'm happy.
good.
and now the food.
her parents will be there, I hope, grandparents will be there, Cuban relatives, all her childhood friends... and who knows, Carlos Alonso and the two guys who made her the meat of their sandwich.
and I'll be introduced as the teacher who's on television.
what's wrong with that?
what's wrong is I'll be judged for my age.
they'll say all the horrible things they say in these cases.
she's with me because she wants something in return, and I'm with her because I like new girls.
pathetic.
it's about time to face your situation. That's what I think.
who is Carlos Alonso?
some guy.
Hello? - Hi.
did I wake you up? - No, I was reading.
I just wanted to say goodnight and tell you how happy I am that you're going to come tomorrow and how important it is for me.
and for me too.
okay.
see you then.
see you then.
good night. - Good night.
Consuela... - David, where are you?
you won't believe what just happened, my...
I'm stuck on the George Washington bridge.
my car's broken down.
Consuela?
I called AAA.
they say they're going to be at least an hour.
and then they're going to have to get me off the bridge and tow me some place.
I'll call you right after, Okay?
Consuela?
why are you doing this to me?
Consuela?
Hello?
one new message.
first new message...
I saw you today on television, playing the wise old man who knows everything.
the one who always knows better.
the one who knows what's good culture, and what people should read, and all about music all about art...
you know so many things.
but I'm here, trying to celebrate this important moment of my life.
and I decide to have a party and I want to have you here.
Why?
why, Consuela, why?
because you mean everything to me.
you do.
but, anyway, you are not here.
I just wanted you to know something that I loved you.
very much.
very, very much.
Consuela?
it's me. Open up.
Kenny. - Come on, open up.
hello.
why are all the lights off?
I'm having an affair.
did you hear what I just said?
you!
is that all that you have to say? - Congratulations.
congratulations...
you're a riot, you know that?
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what to say.
this is awful.
I'm coming apart.
I thought you were happily married, you always told me you were happily married.
I am. - Well...
forgive me, but I can't see how that can be entirely true.
anyway, you don't look terribly happy right now.
but you don't understand. - Kenny...
I'm trying to understand. You're having an affair.
so you come here, because, what, I'm the expert.
there's no-one else to talk to.
I'm sorry.
what you going to do?
I don't know.
would you like something to drink?
what will you have?
glenfiddich, bourbon, vodka, Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Armagnac...
no. Diet coke.
diet coke it is.
this isn't some kind of irresponsible fling.
I love Lisa, I really do, and the kids are my whole life.
knowing you, it's probably simplest if you just break off the other...
Oh, I can't.
this woman is like no-one else on earth.
I've never felt so alive, so full of energy.
and she's a great person.
she has degrees in chemistry and art history.
she plays the oboe, for Chris sakes.
and her kids are fabulous. - She has children?
three. Scott, little Shawn...
hold on Kenny! What are we talking about here? Her children or your adultery?
don't call it that. - Well, what would you call it?
see, you sound like Lisa. You try to over-simplify a complicated situation.
I...
I'm committed to this relationship, unlike you, who's terrified of committing to anyone.
Dana is a real person. So don't equate what's happening to me with your serial tom-catting.
what have I got to do with it? - Plenty!
anyway, Dana isn't one of your little star-struck students.
if you want my advice, Lisa mustn't know a word of this, until you've made up your mind... - Lisa already knows.
why on earth did you tell Lisa?
you expect me to lie to my wife? - Now you can't retreat even if you want to.
God!
I don't know why I came here. I don't know what help you could possibly be.
except maybe, maybe...
I hoped that you might relate to me, as a father, for just once. - I don't know how to relate to you.
you're so morally superior to me in every way.
even our adulteries can't compare.
yours plays the oboe, what have I got to put up against that
she probably writes poetry in her spare time, and her kids do too.
you're such a jerk.
however, if you are, as you say, committed, you're going to have to end your marriage.
how can I? If I walk out on Lisa and the kids, if I do what you did, then I'll destroy them.
why do you say that? You survived. Your mother survived.
are you trying to tell me that you did the morally correct thing by walking out on us?
it was honest.
God!
I'm leaving. - There's the door.
goodbye. - Bye.
Consuela didn't call the next day.
and not even the day after.
she never called again.
you've gotta eat something.
you gotta get out of this fucking bed.
I ruined everything, George. - You didn't ruin anything.
it just came to its natural end.
you were her teacher, her big growing-up experience.
you called the whole thing from day one.
it was bound to end sooner or later. Eat.
I miss her.
well, that's easy for you to say now that she's out of the picture.
I was in love with her, George. I never felt anything like that in all my life.
well, it's better late than never. Now you gotta get back with your own life.
you're gonna be feeling better soon.
time heals all wounds.
now, open wide cause here comes.
the train entering the station.
open wide. There you go...
how does that taste like? I added a little oregano and some chives.
you're going to make somebody very happy one day.
you know, after a long time of silence and betrayal, lately Amy and I have been finding each other again. - You and Amy?
your wife? Are you feeling OK? - Yes, I feel OK.
that's the most incredible thing I've heard you say in all the years I've known you.
life always keeps back more surprises than we can ever imagine.
Yeah.
Dave...
I need a favor.
and they want somebody to introduce me.
George, I understand you wanting to distract me, but this is transparent occupational therapy.
this is no joke. I want you to present me in the most embarrassing, flattering terms all those portly pandering profs.
present you? Who's going to present me?
Forrest Lawn? George, you're a champ for asking, but I can't write anything now. I'm finished.
I may never teach another class. Find somebody else.
I spent half of life playing Horatio, to your third rate Hamlet.
listening to your endless naval gazing, your moaning about Kenny, the father-hater, the women who don't know when goodbye means goodbye.
and for this you owe me big-time.
now I expect you to do this in the name of our friendship.
now would you fuckin' eat something?
the Poetry of George O'Hearn makes no apology for itself.
as A. E. Housman wrote in his celebrated essay, "I don't know what poetry is, but I recognize it when I hear it."
there can be no question that this evening's guest writes what we all instantly recognise as poetry.
since the publication 25 years ago of his first work in the New Yorker, George O'Hearn's vigorously masculine voice has become a fixture of the American poetic landscape.
poetry which is one and the same time, the language of the street, potent, urban and impatient, but also the un-selfcentered promptings of an unquiet heart.
in 1988, that unique combination of sensibilities earned George O'Hearn the Pulitzer Prize.
but rather than procrastinate further, or damn him with praise, he will inevitably consider feint. I turn the proceedings over to New York's own, or, should I say, America's own, George O'Hearn.
George!
I'll call an ambulance.
Hi, David.
he just woke up a little while ago.
Hi, David.
George...
it's Kepesh.
I'm here, George. I'm here.
George...
I owe you.
I wonder who he thought I was.
I think he knew perfectly well.
you're sweet.
I took him as he was.
he so appreciated that.
he took me the same.
you're going where? - I just told you. Florida.
to meet her parents, just for the week-end.
the girl's... - Her name is Dana.
you're going to meet her folks?
well, I think they should know I'm not just some kind of pervert.
Kenny, you're nearly 40 years old. You don't need the approval of the parents of a girl who has three children of her own.
does she want her parents' approval?
if you want my approval, fine, you've got it.
I just wanted you to understand. This doesn't mean that I don't love Lisa.
Kenny, what are you doing?
you're going to escape from one prison and race headlong into another maximum security facility.
where did you get the idea that marriage is a prison?
from serving time. It wasn't about your mom.
I just wasn't cut out for it. - Is this your version of approval?
Kenny, listen to me.
I'm the only father you have.
I'm the only one you'll ever have.
what a comfort that is.
I know I disappointed you.
but you're not a child, you've got to get past this rage.
if you ever want there to be anything between us you've gotta turn the page.
now excuse me, I have an appointment.
I'm not finished.
I really have to run.
what appointment? - George's funeral.
george who?
your friend George? - Yeah.
he died? - Yeah. I gotta go.
we'll finish this later, OK?
I'm sorry.
Hello?
I happened to be in town. I saw the obit in The Times and I...
in two columns.
not bad for a poet, I guess.
how are you holding up?
not so good, but I'll be OK.
how's everything?
Seattle is a great place to build a business. I'm exhausted.
but I love it.
What're you thinking about, Dave?
nothing.
we kept acting like teenagers all our life, that's all.
who's we? Me and you? - Yes, you and I.
we spent our life chasing after what?
the only time you got pregnant you had an abortion because the time wasn't right.
that was 15 years ago.
did the right time ever come?
not the right person.
do you remember that tampon you found in my bathroom?
that thing belonged to a young girl I was in love with.
what...
what kind of chance did we have?
she and I? None.
at best we could have dragged it out a couple of years but in the end she'd have realized there was little room in her life for a man thirty odd years older than she.
nothing ever should have happened between me and that girl.
it was just a mistake.
you're getting old, David.
the way men look at me changes every day.
there are women my age, a lot of women who are on these dating websites.
you're guaranteed a certain number of dates per year.
and you pay for the silence...
and...
the same conversation, every time.
I like them like that.
is it possible that this is really the first time we talked to each other?
well...
after 20 years of sleeping together, it's not bad.
I know a lot of people who never got that far in 40 years of marriage.
what time is your flight?
I'll take you.
no.
why start now?
I concentrated on my work.
I kept asking myself if it was right not to go to that fucked up graduation party of hers.
it took two years but I finally got past the death of George.
I even accepted the loss of Consuela.
I recovered my equilibrium and my independence.
who am I kidding?
the paintings and sculptures of the day would literally and figuratively absorb the energy.
they were almost a self-contained slice of life, if you will.
that, you put beautifully in your opening chapter.
but also you're making a comment on the relationship between art and ownership.
well, that's exactly right.
the people who buy these paintings, they think that they own the pictures.
but, in reality, the pictures own them.
the pictures own them.
they're allowed to live. They're allowed to house them all.
they're really custodians for a period of time. They're free to admire it, - they're free to worship it if they like... - In theory you could purchase the Great Pyramid. - I take your point.
but at the end of the day, the pyramid will still be around and you'll be with the Pharaohs.
my guest today is Susan Reese, her novel is "Blue Hyacinth."
this is "Book Chat."
I'm David Kapesh.
then that's it, that was lovely. Thank you.
not too painful.
indeed!
thank you.
Oh, and happy New Year. - Thank you and congratulations.
it's a really... it's a good read.
thank you.
one new message.
six saved messages. The first new message.
Hi, David, it's Consuela.
how are you?
feels strange to call you, but I want to talk to you. I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you myself before you hear it from someone else. I don't know...
please, call when you can. My cell phone number is...
please call. Thanks. Bye.
Hi, David, it's Consuela.
I realized that I lived all these years just to listen to these words.
I collapsed to the floor, listening to her message, again and again, fearing the worst.
she was in love. She was getting married.
perhaps she even wanted my blessing.
David?
David...
where are you?
I'm in the car. I was in front of your building when I left the message.
what are you doing driving around New York on New Year's Eve?
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
what's the matter, Consuela?
I need to see you.
then come.
do you have time? - Always.
okay. I'm coming now. - Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
so...
how have you been?
that one's new.
Yeah, it's Edward Weston.
I like your hair.
I cut a little each day.
so when it disappears I won't miss it as much.
I'm sick.
I have cancer, breast cancer.
I'm having surgery in two weeks.
cancer?
this is...
are you...?
afraid? No.
no? - Not exactly.
that's not what I meant. I meant...
what happened?
I was in the shower one morning and I... I felt this thing under my arm.
so I went to the doctor and he said it was probably nothing to worry about.
I went to a second doctor and a third doctor and you know the story.
the third doctor said it was something to worry about.
and did you panic?
Yes, I panicked.
I spent a whole month in pure fear.
tonight I was going to go to this party, thinking it would be better than staying by myself, but...
David...
David, no.
don't cry.
do not cry.
why didn't you call me? Why didn't you call me when this happened?
I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell you of all people.
you know what's funny?
I feel older than you now.
you promise me one thing, that if you should ever start to panic, during the night or during the day or any time, you'll phone me.
what can I do?
what can I do?
it's...
it's like not being able to get into a, a comfortable position, because no matter which way you turn, you're stuck.
I'm stuck inside myself.
when I think of all the things, I used to think were so important, all the arguments I got into with my mom, It's stupid all the time I wasted.
sleeping...
sleeping my life away.
David...
I need to ask you a favor.
something I can only ask you.
anything. What is it?
after you, I never had a boyfriend who loved my body as much as you did.
I find that hard to believe.
were there many?
no.
what about work? Never fooled around at work?
they all did. - Well, of course they did.
I just wasn't interested.
I know you loved me.
and you loved my body.
so before the doctors ruin it... - Stop.
stop talking that way and stop thinking that way.
Consuela, no-one's going to ruin you.
Consuela...
what is it you want me to do?
that's the Paris Opera House.
I missed you.
I missed all the places we never went.
would you like to stay here tonight?
no.
I have to go.
would you like me to go with you when you go to the hospital?
Consuela...
you can't do this alone.
why do you say that?
you do everything alone.
David...
poor man.
you're more scared than me.
will you still want to fuck me if I lose my breast?
will you be up for that?
will you?
I'm sorry David.
really sorry.
I'm scared, David.
happy New Year!
happy New Year.
dad... - Hi.
what are you doing here?
I wondered if you could spare me a few minutes?
er...
alright, come here.
Yep, uhuh.
Thanks, I owe you one.
Bye.
she's in very good hands.
I know her surgeon. - And?
they're going to operate tomorrow.
she told me in two weeks.
no.
they're going to do it tomorrow. - What does that mean?
I'm not her doctor. So I don't know exactly, but it's probably not a good thing.
it's a nightmare.
have you known her long?
I hadn't seen her for a couple of years.
she called me out of the blue on New Year's Eve with the news.
I've got all her phone numbers, but I don't want to make the wrong move here.
she... when she left...she told me she didn't want me to call her. She was quite definite about that.
I'm sorry.
Yep, I know, I'm coming.
I'm sorry to have barged in on you like this.
I know you're strapped for time.
I'm sorry. I couldn't be of more help. Stay strong.
that's what you tell your patients.
it must be really tough. Oncology.
I was your son. I was prepared for it.
I'm glad to see you again. - Yeah.
and I'm sorry that it was under such, uh... - Me too.
how are things at home?
we're still together.
thanks for asking.
I'm glad to hear it.
dad...
what are you gonna do?
why did she have me take these photographs?
did she want them for herself?
or did she intend for me to keep them?
well, that makes sense.
did I ever tell you my theory about beautiful girls?
a million times.
no-one can see them.
well?
did you ever see her?
I mean all of her.
I didn't understand what I saw.
a lawyer's answer.
you're over-analysing it.
who would end a relationship because I missed her graduation party.
she was this weird clutch of inconsistencies.
you're talking about her in the past tense.
so do you think they will let me in today?
she just got out of intensive care. You can go today.
Kenny, thank you.
you're welcome.
time passes when you're not looking.
David...
Yes.
they took the whole thing.
I didn't think you would come.
Why?
why did you think that?
because I'm no longer beautiful.
yes you are.
you know Hipolita, the beautiful Amazonian queen?
she actually cut off her right breast so she could shoot her arrows faster and she was no slouch.
will the book be different if we read it 10 years later?
you remember my first class.
I remember everything. - Me too.
every second.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm here.
several weeks ago, he learned of the existence of a woman named Irene Adler.
he's only loved one person in his life, as far as I can tell, and she was murdered.
your girl, that was him.
that was Moriarty.
and whom do I have the pleasure of speaking to?
my name is Moriarty.
I believe we're overdue for a chat.
well, if this is Moriarty, then, yeah, long overdue.
if?
you're just a voice on the end of a telephone.
I don't even know if you have a first name.
mind telling me your first name?
I appreciate your passing my message along to Sebastian Moran.
I hear his prognosis is quite grave.
so what?
I expect you to feel angry because I manipulated you.
rather easily, I might add.
chin up, Holmes.
manipulation is my business.
seems more like murder is your business.
a part of it.
explain.
consider me a spider.
I sit motionless at the center of my web.
that web has a thousand radiatis, and I know well every quiver of each of them.
I do little myself, I only plan.
but my agents are numerous and splendidly organized.
if there is a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed, the word is passed to me, the matter is planned and carried out.
so, you're a pimp, and assassins are your girls.
Yes, I suppose that's one way of putting it.
irene Adler.
did you have her killed?
that is the question, is it not?
the one that's haunted you these many months?
why'd you do it?
and what is your interest in me?
you want answers.
I don't blame you.
but first, I require something of you.
I'd like to hire you.
not as an assassin, though I do believe you'd excel in that position.
I'd like to secure your services as an investigator.
a man named Wallace Rourke was murdered in Brooklyn several months ago.
the New York Police Department investigated, but failed to find any leads.
bring his killer to justice, and I promise
I'll give you all the answers you can handle.
new York Ledger from December.
Wallace Rourke, mechanic, age 43, found stabbed to death in an alley in Brooklyn.
can we just take a moment to talk about what just happened?
Mr. Rourke's missing wallet and watch led the police to suspect he was the victim of a mugger.
Moriarty, or someone claiming to be Moriarty, called and asked you to take a case, and you're doing it.
and why wouldn't I? For one thing, he's dangerous.
for another, you think he's behind Irene's death.
Yes, and in the course of one brief exchange, I've already gleaned that Moriarty is between 40 and 45 years of age, he hails from Sussex, and he has some interest or connection to Mr. Wallace Rourke.
as the case continues, there will be more interactions.
and with each interaction, more of the man will be revealed to me.
assuming the man on the phone is actually is Moriarty.
even if it is a mere minion, just identifying the minion will get me one step closer to identifying the man himself.
how do you know it's not a trap?
how do you know he doesn't want to kill you?
he doesn't. How can you be so sure?
because three years ago, he ordered Daniel Gottlieb not to kill me.
last night, I was in the sights of another assassin's rifle.
yet, here I sit.
it couldn't be clearer-- he doesn't want me dead.
then what does he want?
that's precisely what I intend to find out.
so...
as we already know, Wallace Rourke was attacked by an unknown assailant.
his watch, wallet and cell phone were taken.
he bled to death in an alleyway...
he was married.
perhaps a condolence call to his widow is in order.
captain Gregson wants a word with you.
can it wait?
not you. Miss Watson.
Hi. You wanted to see me?
Oh, yeah. Oh, come in.
sit down. Close the door.
you ever have trouble trying to remember your online passwords?
sure. Sometimes. Why?
I got this friend named Eddie.
we grew up together.
he invented a widget for storing all your passwords for your computer into one place.
you know the one? - Yeah.
he made a fortune, sold his company, and he moves his family down to Boca Raton.
good for Eddie.
Yeah, but not so good for his daughter, Kelly.
she ended up with a pretty serious drug problem.
I'm sorry to hear that.
so Eddie and I were talking on the phone the other day.
and he happened to mention that he and his wife were looking to hook Kelly up with a sober companion after she gets out. I'm thinking, I know a great one.
you know that I don't do kind of work anymore.
probably only take you a coup of months.
it's not like you're formally committed to Holmes anymore. Right?
hmm. Speaking of.
he's already downstairs. I should go meet him.
but you know what? I will give you some other names.
woman: I'm sorry, I've never heard the name "Moriarty" before in my life.
does your husband do any business with any British people?
Wallace worked in a garage.
I mean, he knew a couple of Dominican guys.
when the police questioned you, you mentioned something about Wallace thinking that he was being followed.
Yeah. A few weeks, um, before he died, he kept seeing the same car in his rearview mirror, but it just...
it happened the one time, so the cops said it didn't have anything to do with the mugging.
are those some of your husband's things?
uh, yeah.
Wallace was kind of a packrat.
do you mind if we take a look?
Yeah.
so, you said you're consulting detectives, right?
not the real kind?
Oh, I assure you, the work that we do is quite real.
so, does that mean there's a new lead?
not exactly, but sometimes, new eyes on a case can be just as useful as new information.
as a matter of fact, it might be quite useful to spend a bit more time with his belongings.
perhaps we could borrow them for a few days.
sure.
uh, fine, yeah. Take whatever.
Thanks.
um, I thought I read in the police report that the mugger also stole your husband's phone.
Yeah, well, like I said--Wallace is a packrat.
he never threw anything out.
that's his old phone.
a few weeks before he died, someone bumped into him on the street and spilled coffee all over it.
he had his new one on him when he died.
please... please... find whoever did this.
according to Wallace's financial records, him and his wife were living quite close to the bone.
is that significant?
Moriarty paid Sebastian Moran and Daniel Gottlieb quite handsomely.
Oh, so, you think Rourke was working for him, too?
Moran and Gottlieb were assassins.
perhaps he did something less dangerous.
perhaps he was just good at hiding his money.
maybe, but why would Moriarty want to expose another one of his employees?
it seems a little risky, doesn't it?
it's one of the advantages of being a shadowy criminal mastermind, I imagine.
you get to take the occasional risk.
but I see your point.
according to the M. E.'s report, Rourke's initial wounds were these two stabs to the chest.
the wounds are smooth, not jagged, which would seem to suggest that he was not moving or struggling when he was stabbed.
you're saying he didn't resist?
I'm saying he was motionless or maybe he was frozen in fear.
Wallace was a former Army Ranger.
given his combat experience, that doesn't seem likely.
see this bruise below his left ear?
that's from a blow to the mastoid process.
that's designed to stun.
he wasn't frozen in fear; he was immobilized.
then the killer stabbed him in each lung, silencing him for good.
whoever attacked Wallace wanted him dead, and knew how to do it.
this is not the work of your average street thug looking for a wallet, no.
Moriarty's right.
obviously, there's more to this than meets the eye.
and now...
I require sustenance.
out with it, Watson, or you're gonna spend all night almost asking me something.
what was she like?
Irene, you-you talk about what happened to her, but you never talk about who she was.
she was difficult to explain.
and I mean that as a compliment.
she was American.
Really?
I held it against her only briefly.
she was an exquisite painter.
she made her living restoring Renaissance paintings for art museums.
she traveled extensively because of her work.
she was highly intelligent, optimistic about the human condition.
you mean that as a compliment, too?
I do, oddly enough.
I usually consider it a sign of stupidity, but with Irene, it seemed...
almost convincing.
she was, to me, the woman.
to me, she eclipsed and predominated all of her gender.
she's the one I ever, um...
and the sex...
you-you don't have to...
I learned things, Watson-- me.
and that hasn't happened before.
what is it?
I think Wallace Rourke might have been right about being followed.
have a look at that.
it's an old shipping label.
for the cell phone he had on him when he died.
look at the return address.
Uh,"Postal Unlimited."
2249 Lexington Avenue.
all the major cellular companies ship from distribution warehouses upstate.
and how does that equal him being followed?
because the simplest way to follow someone in this day and age is to track them via their cell phone.
it's a relatively simple undertaking if you have the device's electronic identification number.
which you would have if you'd supplied the replacement cell.
so who sent Rourke his new phone?
you learning anything?
apparently, if my gut tells me I'm in danger, I probably am.
profound stuff here.
guy runs one of the biggest private security firms in the country; he's got to know something.
Mr. Holmes, Miss Watson.
I'm Daren Sutter.
this is my wife Kate.
we were told you consult for the NYPD.
we have a few questions.
if it's all the same with you, we'd like to ask them in private.
hmm, so you're a third-degree black belt in Kyokushinkai.
that's impressive.
Yeah, only took me 20 years of study to pull it off.
do you practice the, uh, martial arts?
a bit of single-stick now and again.
how can we help you?
this is Wallace Rourke.
your firm was tracking him.
we'd like to know why.
no?
no, I'm afraid we don't recognize him.
several months ago, you or one of your employees ran into Mr. Rourke and made sure that his cell phone met its end via a cup of French Roast.
he ordered another cell phone from his provider but, according to them, never switched it on, most probably because it was intercepted en route by you or another one of your employees.
instead, unbeknownst to Mr. Rourke, he received and began to use an identical cell phone supplied by your company.
we found the shipping label for that in Rourke's things.
the return address is for a shipping store right around the corner from here.
a helpful gentleman identified your company as the one who paid to have it sent.
once Rourke activated your phone, you were able to monitor his every move, you were able to monitor his every move, he was stabbed to death three months ago in Brooklyn.
actually we only surveilled Rourke for a couple of days.
well, investigative work like this merits at least some kind of an answer; it's not as if we can keep denying any knowledge of Rourke.
right?
you understand we're not admitting to tracking his phone.
no, no, that would be illegal.
we looked into Mr. Rourke based on threats he allegedly made against a client.
after a brief period of legal surveillance, we realized the claims were unfounded;
we stopped the surveillance.
who was this client?
I'm afraid that's confidential.
let me guess: the client who hired Sutter Risk Management to investigate Wallace Rourke is our new suspect in his murder.
now all we have to do is figure out his name.
already have.
first name "Made""second name "Up."
I don't believe he exists. - Why not?
because I believe we've already met Wallace Rourke's murderer, and he's the spitting image of this man.
Daren Sutter's book amounts to a virtual confession to the murder of Wallace Rourke.
he published that book five years ago.
how'd he confess to something he hadn't done yet?
it is a window into what drew him to the field in the first place.
look at page 13.
february, 1991, Westport, Connecticut.
Sutter was 23.
his older sister Leah was brutally murdered during what the police believe was a home invasion robbery.
Sutter was staying with her at the time.
Oh, he got home just as the perpetrator fled the house.
more than that. He came face-to-face with the man.
he gave the police a full description.
enough for them to generate...
a detailed sketch.
so you think Wallace Rourke is the one who killed Sutter's sister 22 years ago.
the police never caught the culprit.
Sutter was tormented by his failure to protect her and law enforcement's failure.
he dropped out of business school.
he began to study law enforcement, security... and Kyokushinkai karate, which utilizes mastoid strikes.
just like the blow used to stun Wallace Rourke before he was stabbed to death.
now all you really know is that Wallace Rourke has a passing resemblance to an old police sketch.
did he have a criminal history?
according to his Army record, he enlisted under a waiver, which means a judge gave him the choice between prison or the Army.
his conviction was for breaking and entering.
can we place Rourke anywhere near the murder?
following his discharge from the Army in November 1990,
Rourke moved back to his mother's house in Stamford, Connecticut, which I believe is half an hour's drive from where Leah was killed.
so it is possible that, over 20 years ago, Wallace Rourke killed Sutter's sister.
and that Rourke's recent death was the result of Sutter tracking him down and killing him in retribution.
but why does Moriarty care about any of this?
I would venture he wants us to bring down Sutter.
Sutter's security firm, as you yourself pointed out, is one of the best in the country.
with Sutter removed, it would in theory, make his clients more vulnerable.
Moriarty may have one of them in his crosshairs.
which means our work on this case could cost someone their life.
not if our work leads to Moriarty's undoing first.
which will mean we save that person and anyone else Moriarty intends to victimize in the future.
okay, let's say you're right-- Moriarty planned this.
that would mean he already knew that Sutter killed Wallace Rourke.
which is why I've arranged to speak with Sutter first thing in the morning in private.
in private?
it's gonna be a very delicate conversation.
for what it's worth, he's not bringing his wife either.
Mr. Sutter, thank you for meeting me.
stand up, please.
okay...
can you tell me what you're doing there?
it's a bug-sweeper. I'm checking for listening devices.
okay.
right.
okay.
thank you. Your turn.
when you've heard what I have to say, you'll want to be quite sure we're not being recorded.
excellent, good.
now then, I'm curious.
how do you feel since you killed Wallace Rourke?
okay, we're done. No, no, listen to me.
consider it an inquiry from one scarred man to another.
or rather from one man to one whose wounds have finally begun to heal.
I can tell the change from the pictures in your office.
since December you've lost 15 pounds, you got rid of the bags under your eyes.
both signs of a lifting depression.
avenging your sister's death has... has freed you.
I told you-- we surveilled Rourke for a couple of days; that's it.
you're a terrible liar.
actually, I'm an excellent liar.
no, no, no-- better than most and excellent are two different things.
I know that you killed Rourke.
if you had proof, you'd be talking to the police, right?
I don't have any proof yet.
it's just a matter of time.
unless we can find some way to divert my attention.
Moriarty.
does the name mean anything to you?
should it?
Yes, it should.
he pointed me in your direction.
I think he wishes to profit from your incarceration.
I'm just not sure how.
I've never heard that name before in my life.
now you're telling the truth.
okay, I'm gonna need access to your client files.
see if I can discern if there's a link between him and one of them.
you want me to trust you with my business based on some crazy story about a mystery man plotting my demise?
no.
some proof then.
judging by the precision with which you killed Rourke, not to mention Moriarty's resources,
I wouldn't be surprised if he learned of your transgression via listening device in your office and/or home.
Impossible-- we sweep both regularly.
