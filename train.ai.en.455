government bureaucrats cannot set an ideal currency price that is optimal for everyone.
government bureaus were established specifically to monitor the labor of women and children.
government by experts sounds tempting, especially in a crisis.
government can always raise taxes or print more money-and it still offers full-time, well-paying positions with generous benefits, including ample holidays, sick days, and vacation days.
government can hire people directly to maintain the nation's parks and playgrounds and to help in schools and hospitals.
government cannot do it all. As we work hard to break welfare dependency and get young people ready for the labour market, we need businesses to give them a chance, and not just fall back on labour from abroad.
government cash may also breed dependency.
government coffers are overflowing even as income disparity worsens across the country and overt displays of largesse by party officials are a common source of discontent.

government consumption and investment has dragged growth down in five of the last seven quarters, thanks to cuts at the state and local level and falling defence spending.
government consumption expenditure with congestion was analyzed and optimal fiscal policy in a stochastic endogenous growth model discussed.
government control has direct and important infection on patent ution.
government control of the rents of houses and apartments is a special form of price control.
government control over the military has decreased, not increased, and that trend is certainly not the fault of progressive ideologues.
government controls on speculators have already started to bring residential property prices down.
but this has all been too much for me.
