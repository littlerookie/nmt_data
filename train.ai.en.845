Yes, I just had a question.
how's school?
it's great. I wish we had it on weekends.
how old are you, Joan? What? Eighteen.
is everything okay? Is there anything inside me?
just get dressed and come into my office.
Joan, has your mother even talked to you about sex?
please, God, I want to die!
Yeah, all the time.
you know how babies are conceived?
Oh, yeah. We talk about everything. She's a wonderful mother.
then why do you think you're pregnant? You're a virgin.
I want to die, right now.
so it's crazy to think one kiss could get you pregnant.
but how would I know?
what about the Virgin Mary?
look at Saint Perpetua?
she transformed into a man, fought with the devil and walked on his head.
weird things happen.
can you do me a favor?
I need to go to Boston on a jerk errand for my boss.
can you give the girls dinner?
Yes! I got a great pot roast in the freezer that Sophia left.
sound good?
antyhing hot and not shaped like a star sounds good.
very funny. You know what?
your mouth sounds like your sister's. I'm not pleased about that.
the Crains are having a party for New Year.
did you get an invitation?
I'm going. Will you be there? It's a costume party.
what do you think? Go.
as what? A goldfish!
well, you're a big help.
as always, it was a pleasure.
Oklahoma
when the wind comes sweeping down the plains
and the waving wheat can sure smell sweet
when the wind comes right behind the rain
Oklahoma
every night my honey lamb and I...
where is everybody?
in here!
well, where's here... What is this?
Hey, what's going on in here?
young Esther Williams wanted to know what sleeping under the sea would be like.
her wish being my command, hey, presto!
wall-to-wall ocean.
you're certifiable, you know that?
then I'm with the right family.
let's show her.
I'll do it.
Oh, that is so neat.
it's beautiful.
so how's that? Sitting under the ocean.
flying fish and everything.
it's good.
Oh, dinner's ready!
let's eat. I'm so hungry.
you did all that in one evening and cooked too?
Charlotte we have to thank for dinner.
a feast to put Sophia to shame.
where did you learn how to do this? Home Economics.
if the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, there's hope for you yet.
personally, I don't think that's true.
what do men care about?
astroturf.
according to Lou, it'll ruin baseball.
not to mention the civilized world.
if you want a boyfriend, you better start caring about it too.
if you marry Lou, he can be our dad.
we have a dad.
I've never seen him. He wouldn't make me an ocean.
can we sleep over?
please? No!
I'll think about it.
actually, you should have 2 forks. Why?
you know what happened if we used the wrong fork when I was a kid?
we had to stick them in the ground.
even if the ground was frozen.
we called it the hardware garden. Believe that?
that's nothing. This kid's uncle died and got sprinkled in the garden.
that's nothing.
St. Maragaret of Antioch got eaten by a dragon. And it burst!
when I die, I want to be sprinkled in the ocean.
I could live inside a whale, like Jonah
what if the whale doesn't have a living room and you end up in a tuna fish sandwich?
who are they?
once a man ate at our table without his shirt.
like we were nudists!
Oh, yeah! He yanked quarters out of your ears!
why'd he do that?
I think so he wouldn't spill his dinner on it.
cranberry sauce, please Some chicken?
what's happening?
what usually happens when families sit down to eat together. They talk!
cranberry sauce? Chicken, anyone?
I do! I'd love some!
wait.
I never said you could do this.
let Kate get so attached.
is that terrible?
this is not your family.
if you want to be close, dial direct.
but don't do it through my kids.
never in my life have I wanted to hit a woman as much as I do you.
when you are wrong you're so wrong, it's scary!
you've never done something just to make somebody happy?!
what do you want?
a little trust would be nice!
and if you care about us, would it kill you to show it?!
what do you mean, us?
since when did you and my kids become us?
you're just you, Lou.
me and the girls, that's us!
I was talking about you and me.
if you don't hurry, it'll be New Year's Day!
you'll miss the party!
here's a little something.
an arm!
this year, Mom!
all right. Here's a little more!
are you ready? This is boring!
one, two, three, here I am!
you're a mermaid!
no, I'm a lumberjack! A salesman! You're beautiful!
what do you think?
if I'd had this when you were little
I'd have done my ironing and the diapers in it.
is this the mermaid bus?
I can see it's mermaid time to get into my mermaid car and hit the mermaid road.
get the mermaid out of here. Get my mermaid coat.
get my mermaid keys.
Oh, my God.
I don't think I'll be fresh for the party.
Bye, Mom! Have fun!
have a good time! I will!
good-bye, Mrs. Mermaid! Good-bye, Junior Mermaids!
Where's that handsome hunk of a husband of yours?
out front talking baseball.
he bet $20 they couldn't name 3 players that batted over. 400.
be right back.
ty Cobb, Joe Jackson, Naps Lajoie! You owe me twenty bucks.
last day ever, every of this year.
want to make some resolutions?
what are resolutions?
they're sort of like wishes.
I wish I could swim forever.
I wish I'd known Anne Frank.
and that I didn't lust after Joe so much.
put that right here. We can use that.
why don't you stay and have a drink? It's almost midnight.
Hi, handsome.
nice caretaker's costume.
you look nice.
it's time you and I had a little dance.
little Bo Peep.
can you help with these?
now, spin me.
watch my tail. Sorry.
I'm on pins and needles. Did you win the $20?
what do you think? I'm planning a pilgrimage.
to Lourdes? No, Cooperstown.
ask why.
I'll tell you.
I thought so.
the Baseball Hall of Fame.
before I die, there's 3 things I want from life.
to touch Lou Gehrig's glove.
to be in Florida for Spring Training.
and to take you with me.
two out of three's not bad.
ask me in a couple months.
if you're still here. Exactly.
two minutes everybody!
turn up the TV.
what are we going to do? About what?
this relationship. What's wrong with it?
it's stuck. It has to move or it has to end.
it can't just stay the same.
ultimatums don't sit really well with me.
what if I asked you to marry me?
I'd remind you that you're still married.
then, I'd write. From New Mexico.
live with me.
seven... six... five... four... three... two... one!
well, so far, 1964's a big drag.
are you coming home with me?
another night.
happy New Year's.
I think my car's dead.
think so?
can you help me?
good.
thanks for the ride, Joe.
you bet.
sorry.
could you help me?
I'm having trouble with this tail.
happy New Year.
you kissed him?
you kissed him?! How could you do that?
you let her?!
it was just a New Year's Eve kiss!
you don't believe in New Year's. I know.
what are you guys fighting about?
nothing. Everything.
get inside before you freeze your butt off.
is Charlotte going to run away again?
God willing. Just kidding.
did you have a nice time? Lovely, thank you.
staying there all night, Miss Poopy Face?
why did you let her?!
she kisses everybody, don't you know that?!
it doesn't mean you're special!
it doesn't mean she likes you or anything!
she doesn't like anybody!
okay, Mom, you want to drive Lou away, that's your business.
you want Joe, that's war.
you give me fever
fever
care to dance, Mrs. Flax?
Mrs. Polka Flax.
she'll kill you if you wear that.
go back to your rocks.
act your age, not your shoe size.
who's this?
know your colors and your fabrics.
that's what I tell all my little girls.
shall I tell you a secret?
I'm in love with Joe.
do you kiss each other?
on the lips?
like Superman and Lois Lane?
what's it like?
sometimes when you kiss a person, nothing happens.
it's like kissing your hand or yourself in the mirror.
but when you love someone...
I know. Chemicals.
you mean chemistry, fish head.
how do I look?
like someone drew all over you.
let's celebrate. Cool.
never knew how much something... I care
what are you doing?
sucking out the pimentos. They give me hernias.
you mean hives, fish head.
hit me, sergeant!
okay, but you can only have one. And you have to sip it.
fever
you're giving me fever
tell me about when I was born.
aren't you sick of hearing this story?
you were born in a hospital in Minneapolis on a cold winter's day.
when Mrs. Flax brought you home I pretended you were mine.
where was Pop?
I don't know.
come on, I'll show you the convent.
finish the story.
I'll show you the tower. You've never seen it.
there it is!
isn't it neat?
I want to go up. I'm going.
not me. I'll fall off. No you won't.
how can you go in those shoes?
I'll manage.
I'll go get rocks.
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.
Oh, God. This is real.
this is really real.
get her inside.
Joseph, get an ambulance.
Katie, please don't die. Please.
take Charlotte home. We'll call when there's news. Tell Lou.
Katydid.
you were born in a hospital in Minneapolis on a cold winter day.
I brought you home and Charlotte pretended you were hers.
she even tried to make you call her Mom
we tickled your ears and we watched you sleep.
and the only thing...
the only thing we ever agreed on was that you were... a wonderful child.
she'll be all right.
they're keeping her in one more night for observation.
your mother's on her way home.
she's okay.
she's okay.
you look different.
you look beautiful.
take care.
you too.
be smart and stay away from me.
I mean it.
want to take the book for her?
what were you doing? She could've died!
you were supposed to watch her. She could've died!
what the hell were you doing up there?!
I know what you were doing.
the whole goddamn town knows what you were doing!
I'm warning you! I'm crazy angry!
don't walk away! Don't walk away from me!
I ma not invisible!
talk to me!
Yes, I made a mistake!
Yes, I am really sorry! It was a big mistake!!
I know that!
you're always screwing up and we always pay for it!
every time you get dumped or dump on somebody.
it's not fair!
it is not fair!
I'm tired of being judged by you! You're a kid!
when you're an adult, live how you awnt
until then, we will live my life, my way!
pack!
this move is on you!
if loverboy doesn't like it, too bad!
this is not about him, it's about me.
that's over! He's left!
surprise! It's not like that!
maybe your life works for you but it doesn't work for me!
I'm staying.
and do what? Finish high school.
what's your major? Town tramp?
no, Mom. The town already has one.
you're just one year younger than I was when I had you.
if you hate my life so much, why are you trying so hard to make the same mistakes?
how do you feel about this guy?
I thought I loved him.
sounds familiar.
I thought you would take him away.
did you love my father?
Yeah, I did.
what was he like?
he was charming and...
he made me feel really special for about a minute and a half.
then he was gone.
what did he look like? Like you, only taller.
I don't have any pictures.
we took pictures at the wedding and they didn't come out.
I guess I should have known then.
he's never coming back, is he?
no.
has he ever seen me?
he did once. You were about 4.
he wanted us back?
no. He met another woman and he wanted to get married.
how do you feel about Joe leaving?
it's fine.
I guess it's too later for our birds and bees talk, isn't it?
mom, can we please stay?
I don't know. There's going to be so much talk.
it's a small town.
there's always talk. It's just usually about you.
I'm sorry.
just for a year. Give it a year.
I don't know.
Mrs. Flax promised she'd try and stay put.
I knew that would be hard for her.
but 3 months later she and Lou were still sparring.
he took us to the Baseball Hall of Fame His heaven.
mom was bored but we thought she hid it quite well.
this is Lou Gehrig's glove. You see that?
okay, you touched it. All right, guys.
what's for lunch?
if they squeeze your toes, chew it awhile.
is softens them.
you don't believe me. Eskimos do it all the time.
the wives do it. Would you do it for your old man?
I don't think so. 'Bye.
give me a break!
I'm a nice old man. I'd watch it, Lou.
I might decide to move to a real city.
I hate all these trees and weather.
she won't admit it, but they get along real well.
trees and weather can get to a person.
I got quite a reputation for awhile.
even Mary O'Brien was impressed.
it's not easy, but I'm trying to keep romance on the back burner.
Joe moved to California and opened a nursery.
we write. He sends me funny postcards with pictures of palm trees on them.
greek myths are my new passion.
Charlotte, we're not Greek.
but since the accident, sometimes her hearing gets fuzzy.
I heard Mom say she'd be making a main course tonight.
I saw your wife.
she was guly!
stay away from NCIS!
this is Echo Bravo Nine.
we have been targeted by a surface-to-air missile.
everybody brace for impact!
we have yet to pick up a distress beacon.
get me the Russian embassy.
my office received word of a downed aircraft.
I was not aware that it may have been one of yours.
it is ours, Mr. Pavlenko.
target of a surface-to-air missile.
the passengers-- where are the special agents?
you made this too difficult, Agent Gibbs!
boss! Get in the truck!
our Intel says Sergei survived.
I hit him. He went down.
he got up.
and wherever he is now, there's a good chance he'll be gunning for us.
not if we find him first.
did you see that kid's face when I flashed my cuffs?
she was 12 and sneaking a smoke in the park.
that was probably her first cigarette.
eh, thanks to me, she'll think twice before smoking a second one.
you're welcome, health care system.
park's closed, ma'am. Move along.
Hey, unless you want to put your hands together for old Simon and Garfunkel here... move along.
Oh, man.
she's been strangled.
unit 20-21, reporting an ADW in Town Center West.
request backup and EMT code three.
geez, somebody got her good.
Oh, man, she's still alive, Dave.
expedite medical assistance.
it's okay, ma'am.
everything's gonna be fine.
we're gonna help you.
don't... touch me.
no... no...
maybe.
no.
saw that one on HBO.
definitely not.
okay, Tony, I think this list of "sexy moves in the bedroom is made up, like you said.
I didn't say "made up"" I said "exotic.
so you've heard of these things?
not just heard of them, McGoo.
the amount of... Okay, stop, stop.
I'm sorry I asked.
number six, though, seriously?
Really? You?
want me to tell you about number six?
no.
wait-- yes.
it was a long time ago, in France.
I was young, innocent, flexible.
before number six,
I didn't know that a woman could...
fire a...
jump shot, that she could dunk it... women!
WNBA, I follow it.
you don't have to do that.
the women are just as competitive as the men.
you don't have to change the subject.
I'm not the sex police.
kind of, you are.
um... hello?
I'm married.
I have more sex than the two of you combined.
from what I hear, that's not how that works, but if you want-- All right.
give me that magazine, smart ass.
let's see... hmm.
Yes, yes, yes...
definitely yes.
definitely no.
and... yes. Hmm.
number six?
are you double-jointed?
it was kind of an accident.
Jake and I went camping once, and, uh, camp, uh... we were on a camp...
grab your gear.
navy research scientist was attacked in the park.
he still alive?
Yes, she is.
actually, that's not entirely true.
the victim's dead, sir.
wait a second.
but Dispatch said Naval Research Scientist
Sofia Glazman was found alive.
that report was later amended.
the victim was alive when we found her.
had a piece of wire cutting into her neck.
looked like it was pulled real tight.
so we waited for EMTs.
she say anything?
could barely talk.
we asked about the attack, who did it...
but she just kept asking us not to move her.
begging us not to.
when the EMTs couldn't get to the wire, either, we had no choice but to get her to the hospital.
she passed out from blood loss.
but they loaded her into the ambulance.
and that's when things got ugly.
we finally understood why she didn't want to be moved.
the body's in there.
what happened?
nobody saw the device, sir.
what's Ducky doing here?
well, at least somebody got the updated report.
Thanks, guys.
Yeah.
Ah, Jethro, there was a mix-up in the initial case report.
I trust you were able to avoid the confusion?
two body bags, Duck?
Ah, I see the confusion still reigns.
I know rule number two is "always wear gloves
but when there's this much blood...
rain gear.
in the truck.
when the head is detached from the body, it's standard procedure to transport them separately.
hence, the two body bags.
I'm more interested in how.
I think I found that out, boss.
what is that, a motorized garrote?
man... did you see The Counselor?
that was a pretty good movie.
I mean, what a cast-- you got Brad...
there's a bone stuck in this.
a cervical vertebra.
this thing acts like a wire noose.
keeps getting tighter until it pulls all the way closed.
explains the blood spray.
well, the carotid artery acts, quite literally, as a spigot.
no buttons, no timers, just... on.
once the motor starts, it doesn't stop.
well, apparently, that one did.
that's why the victim begged not to be moved.
I guess the motor must have jammed.
but... when they loaded her onto the ambulance...
upon facing the guillotine, it was common for the condemned to ask for a sharpened blade.
make it clean, fast.
Yeah, well, this execution was purposely neither.
they're sending a message.
Sofia was like a granddaughter to me.
Dr. Havana, do you know anyone who could've done this?
I won't look at those.
and we will need her laptop and notes back again today.
we have a test run tomorrow morning.
it should be Sofia running it.
you lab was working on laser technology?
next big stick in naval warfare.
these lasers aren't weaponized.
data transfer?
Yes. Very good.
I read somewhere that NASA is sending data to the Moon at 662 megabits per second.
word is that by using each color on the light spectrum, that transfer speed could be multiplied.
johns Hopkins. And MIT.
humble brag much?
don't worry, I'm a Caltech man.
sworn enemies don't get extra credit.
aren't both of your mascots beavers?
uh, so, this laser tech is valuable?
maybe in ten years, when it's cost-effective, but, for now, everyone's just trying to make it work.
including Ms. Glazman.
I recruited her when she was still at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
her parents died when she was young.
practically raised herself.
becoming a U. S. citizen and working here was a chance to start fresh.
was she seeing anyone?
no.
how could she have time to have friends or a social life?
she spent every spare minute in the lab.
Mm.
looks like a friend to me.
Sofia's college lab partner in Moscow.
Sofia was recruited by us,
Nelly stayed on and worked for the Russians.
but the two kept a...
professional rivalry.
rivalry. Hm.
professional, I said.
the two of them were... best of friends.
Hey, Gibbs.
I know this looks like a lot of fun.
but it's actually science giving me unexpected answers.
I don't know what to expect.
never seen one of those before.
I know. It's fascinating, huh?
I mean, if only there were another use for it, then it would be cool.
bike lock.
I like where you're head's at.
this motorized garrote would, indeed, keep your bike safe but then you'd probably never be able to move it again, at least not very easily.
this is braided alloy, and it's very, very hard to cut.
impressive.
Oh, you should see the guts.
which were super hard to get to and to reset.
every cog and coil is custom-engineered for size and strength.
it's like a perfect killing machine.
it's not that perfect, Abbs. It broke down.
Yeah, that's what stumped me, too.
at first.
but then I swabbed the inside, and I found a thin layer of a chemical residue - on the relay switch. - Get prints?
no. And there's no hairs and there's no fibers.
but when I processed the sticky gunk, it's actually...
a smoke residue, specifically from a strain of cannabis sativa.
grass?
Yeah. Grass.
if you grew up in the '60s.
um, and our killer must've smoked a lot of it when they were building this thing.
Yeah, we used to call that a "stoner.
that term's actually still culturally relevant.
how's it relevant to our case?
if you can find our killer's stash,
I can match it.
Yeah, DiNozzo. Go.
just got a call.
director Vance wants us to meet him ASAP at the Pentagon.
about what?
he didn't say.
I'm just as in the dark as you are.
SECNAV called, wanted to have a meeting off the books, and here we are.
in the basement.
don't they have secret war rooms for meetings like this?
and we're heading to one.
and the, um, SECNAV asked me to join?
it's my idea, Agent DiNozzo.
need you to guard the war room.
how do you do it?
it's like pigs at the trough.
eh, some places, it really is a trough, ma'am.
Fenway, Wrigley...
Mm-hmm. Mostly stadiums.
director Vance, Agent Gibbs,
I apologize for the location.
well, like Gibbs said, we've been to worse.
you're investigating the murder case of an NRL scientist.
my office was contacted by a foreign embassy claiming to have helpful Intel.
which embassy?
I promised Secretary Kerry to keep this meeting off the radar in order to protect everyone.
which embassy, Madam Secretary?
all yours.
Oh. Yeah, no. I'm...
no, thanks.
so is that just how you pick up women, then?
you just wait outside the door?
no, I'm waiting on a friend.
Oh. My idea is better.
Yeah. Yeah.
S-So, you-you work down here?
Mm...
counselor Pavlenko.
NCIS Agent, uh...
DiNozzo. -Of course.
you are the one who led the Fins onto Russian soil.
Yeah, that's right.
it was a rescue team, actually, because help didn't seem to be coming from anybody else.
in here, counselor.
was that the secretary of the Navy?
agent Gibbs,
I was relieved to learn of your safe return after the helicopter accident
it was no accident.
it was a missile.
which is not why we're here today.
why are we here today?
this time, it is our turn to go through the proper channels and ask for help.
your help.
our victim's former lab partner.
we're already looking into her.
I can help.
benin was a valued asset of our scientific community
was?
moscow has reason to believe she is now in the employ of terrorist Sergei Mishnev.
the same man who you claim shot you down, Agent Gibbs.
benin's colleague.
found in his Moscow flat two days ago.
a sophisticated weapon.
same killer?
she is here in Washington.
Why?
you want us to find your missing scientist.
it is all right, Madam Secretary.
agent Gibbs has highlighted the embarrassing truth.
we are asking NCIS to find Benin and stop her by any means necessary.
and in return, you just want this kept quiet.
save face.
tell your embassy this matter will have our full attention.
and Justice has requested a Joint Terrorism Task Force leader.
FBI will be assisting in the manhunt.
I knew the cold war was heating up, but meeting in the men's room is downright sexy.
you think?
well, it's... need to know.
I didn't catch your name.
I didn't throw it.
Mm. Maybe you could write it down for me, then, right next to your... little phone number.
Mm.
director Vance,
special Agent Gibbs and DiNozzo,
I'd like you to meet FBI Special Agent Pendergast.
she will be your partner for the duration of this case.
pleased to meet you.
Oh. Okay.
now, why are we having a meeting in here?
ask Agent Pendergast.
I did a quick check.
she's a former Deputy U. S. Marshal turned Joint Terrorism Task Force leader.
an FBI manhunter.
and I always catch my prey.
got a question, Gumby?
sorry.
I won't be good with names.
um, my name is McGee.
I'm wondering why we're having this meeting in MTAC.
it's a secure briefing.
we usually just brief in the squad room... ma'am.
call me Leia.
like the princess.
I hate Star Wars.
nobody hates Star Wars.
you do when you're named Leia, Agent DiNozzo.
yet you know his name.
we met earlier.
okay.
Nelly Benin. Russian scientist.
suspected of ties to a Russian terror group, the murder of a colleague in Moscow, and our Navy Research Lab scientist last night here in D. C.
our target entered the U. S. with her Russian passport before it was flagged by Interpol.
bolo's already doing the rounds with LEOs and transportation authorities.
that it?
I got handed this case an hour ago.
NCIS had a head start, so let's see what you got, kick down some doors and find our killer.
come on. I showed you mine. Show me yours.
tell her.
we've already done some digging on Benin.
And? And none of it makes any sense.
up until the suspected murder two days ago, she was a model Russian citizen.
only thing on her record is a ticket for streaking at the Sochi Olympics.
it's pretty ballsy, but hardly a precursor to terrorism and murder.
russian Intel is...
really difficult to verify.
that's putting it nicely.
sir, I understand your hesitation, but Benin is our best and only suspect in this murder, and our orders are to hunt her down.
a suspect, not prey.
if half of what I've heard about NCIS is true, you guys must have something the FBI doesn't.
who are you, what are you doing here, and who was the 27th president of the United States?
FBI Special Agent Leia Pendergast, to catch a killer, Taft.
no. Wait.
Yes, you're right.
but why would Gibbs send you down here alone?
he said we'd get along.
might have been sarcasm, though.
well, he probably noticed that.
not a hunter?
the opposite.
you're a breeder, then?
what?
no.
um, I found a deleted e-mail sent to our headless victim.
it's from a junk account, but it mentions a meeting at a bar around the time of the murder.
how did you get this? - Dr. Havana from the Navy Research Lab turned over her hard drive.
liberty Square Bar is on the other side of the park where the body was found.
our victim was headed to this meeting when she was attacked.
can you trace the junk account?
already did. There's no name, but it originated in Moscow, Russia.
meaning our missing scientist could have sent it.
benin lured her former lab partner to her death.
Yeah, looks that way.
I like her. - Why?
because she winked at you?
I know, right? - I mean, she's only flirting with you to get closer to her prey.
the case. She's using you.
what do we got?
a problem with the timeline.
and airport security.
Ugh. Here we go again.
just 'cause your wee little McGee shows up on the full body scanner.
Hey, it's an invasion of privacy.
but that's not what I'm talking about here.
there was an unrelated security delay at Dulles last night.
something the Russians couldn't have known about.
while the attack was happening in the park,
benin was stuck at the terminal.
she couldn't have killed Glazman.
she's still our only suspect.
you sound like Leia.
our victim's getting a call on her cell phone from the Liberty Square Bar.
same bar from the e-mail.
smells like a trap.
or could be something else.
I'm listening.
McGee and I have been working on kind of a loose theory.
uncertainty.
what if Benin is running?
the flight here, the secret e-mail to our victim and now we know the Russian Intel is shoddy.
what if she's trying to defect?
the Russians don't want their scientist sharing state secrets.
so they accuse her of murder?
she didn't kill our naval scientist, which means she probably didn't kill the guy in Moscow.
and if she knows we're monitoring
Glazman's cell, that call could be her reaching out.
and if she's strapped to a bomb waiting for us to show up?
it was just a theory.
we don't even know what's going on yet.
we are going to the bar anyway, and we're gonna find out.
and we're gonna start by asking nicely.
am I updating the FBI?
no. No, not yet.
got it.
uh, if Leia asks?
geez, DiNozzo, make something up.
she's your girlfriend.
Why? Did she say something?
did she mention me by name?
it's a popular place.
Yeah. Looks like
Barry's having a good time.
think our Russian joined the mishegoss?
at the bar, McGee. Your one o'clock.
she's drinking. That good or bad?
time to test your theory.
Hey, happy Bar Mitzvah, Barry.
so, is that vodka or water?
gin.
and I'm waiting for someone.
I'm only asking 'cause it would say a lot about you, your plans for the evening.
my plans? Who are you?
see, I'd be worried if that glass was filled with water.
it would tell me you don't want to lose control of your faculties, or your nerve.
if you're planning on doing something bad.
so, if I said this was water, you would think I'm dangerous?
killer, perhaps?
Yeah, but I don't think you are.
well, maybe you're wrong.
insurance.
in case I don't like what you have to offer.
so choose your next words carefully.
if you're looking to defect, we can help.
then why didn't you just say so?
everything all right, McGee?
Yeah, I think so, boss.
no, everything is far from okay.
but it's a start.
my name is Nelly Benin, and I'm seeking asylum in the United States.
Gibbs. NCIS.
why don't we get you out of here?
okay, fine, but let's two things straight.
I didn't kill anybody.
and... I have to pee.
wait. What about that bomb?
there isn't one.
just pulled out the insides of an old calculator.
I got this.
so, that, of course, was accounting.
the big abacus gave it away.
and here's the wall.
Ah, the wall has seen a lot of action lately.
Sergei Mishnev is your number one?
that's odd. You must want him pretty bad.
don't question wall.
your team has desks in here?
Oh, God.
the big orange room? That'd give me a headache. No.
we're in the Stephen J. Cannell annex.
I watched The A-Team.
pardon me?
and Rockford and The Greatest American Hero, mm-hmm.
Really? - Mm.
you found her, didn't you?
I'm sorry. Who?
and this was going so well.
the tour?
yet you-you continue selling me bull?
Hardcastle and McCormick.
underrated Cannell classic.
21 Jump Street
kind of fascist and weird, but I'm into it.
sorry.
not used to playing the tough guy.
but you still think I'm dangerous.
well, your bluff was a little too good.
I didn't find out my friend was dead until I got here.
things are going so well today.
there. All better.
geez. Come on!
let's go.
pardon.
something wrong? - Marijuana.
this proves I had nothing to do with the murders.
well, that depends.
I don't know who that woman was, but I know who she's working for.
leader of a rogue military group in Russia.
Yeah. Yeah, I know who he is.
well, I didn't, not until last week when he approached me in a café outside my apartment.
that's him. He knew I was working for the government lab, but he wanted me to join him in a private sector.
hmm. Doing what?
he refused to say.
that's how I knew it wasn't a normal job offer.
so, I politely turned him down.
you are going to help me after this?
let me stay in the U. S?
Mikhail.
a coworker.
I told him about the job, and he said he'd received the same offer by the same man... on the same day.
Yeah, well, you both turned him down.
the next morning, I got a call that Mikhail had been murdered, and unless I took the job, I was next.
when do I talk to your consulate about formal naturalization?
Yeah, murder suspects don't get citizenship.
I'm not a killer!
then finish the story.
Sofia and I had been competing on the same laser research.
but she was the only one I could turn to.
it never occurred to me that they would find out and go after her, too.
Sergei and his group want me dead because I refused to work for them.
russia has police.
Sergei said it would do no good.
he said he had many friends.
that's a big jump from murder suspect to innocent victim.
the fact that I had anything to do with this is a lie!
who told you I murdered my friends?
I know you have our scientist.
nice to see you, too.
madam Secretary.
I miss anything?
the Russians calling us liars.
so the usual, then?
very good, but I know you've had Miss Benin in custody for hours.
call it intuition.
I hope it's not the same intuition that told you that Nelly Benin is our killer, because she's not.
now you're calling me a liar.
the usual.
you gave us bad Intel, Bad Anton.
I know.
moscow doesn't always tell me everything, which can put me in an awkward position.
so why the secret meetings?
the urgent manhunt?
I believe you call it "better safe than sorry.
hmm.
but since she is no longer a murder suspect, all the better.
we have a government plane waiting at Dulles for our safe and immediate return.
well, that's assuming that we have her.
madam Secretary, I do not think you want to open an international wound over a scientist.
you did.
I will tell Moscow we have your absolute cooperation.
ass.
but he's right, Leon.
we can't spend political capital here.
I... I was just sitting down to write a note, and then Pavlenko walked in.
no. You sit wherever you like.
I want to know how the hell the Russians found out we had Benin.
get me Agent Gibbs.
certainly. Hold on, please.
Hey.
I knew you found Benin.
couldn't talk to you until we talked to her. You understand.
no, I don't.
Hey, we missed this room on the tour.
check it out.
no more tours, no more lies.
well, have a seat.
let's talk about it.
if you killed me right here, right now, my dead body would refuse to sit at that table.
did you tell the Russians we had Benin?
treason?
Ah. Light treason.
we've done some digging.
you've been assigned to protect three Russian emissaries in the last three months.
and, in fact, the Russian embassy specifically requested your assignment to this case.
treason. - For hire.
$28, 000 was deposited in your bank account at the beginning of the month from an offshore account.
I could kill you.
then it'd be treason and murder.
you've lied to me, and you've made accusations, but now you're wasting my time.
I'm not your leak.
I believe you.
so tell us who sent the money, and everyone else can.
go ahead, trace the account.
now who's wasting time?
belongs to my father.
your father has Russian ties? - No.
I can't believe you.
I'm trying to believe you.
my father has money.
a lot of it.
he didn't come into it till after I was 17.
but now he sends me $28, 000 every year.
not because I want it, or because I need it.
just because it's, uh... some kind of tax benefit.
our relationship has always been a little, um...
challenging.
what would you know about it?
well, it's a long story.
well, then, we should skip it, because I have a job to do, and our Russian scientist has a flight to make.
and you have prey to catch.
always do.
except this one wasn't running from you, and she's still being hunted.
this group wants me dead, and you're sending me back?
Sergei will find me.
clearly, my government doesn't care about stopping him.
unfortunately, your government has made a lot of things clear, Miss Benin.
no. The United States grants asylum to political refugees and those fleeing religious persecution.
how is this any different?
I'm sorry.
please. I have value.
am I too late?
for what?
we identified our killer.
using your description from the bar,
I got a hit on our hit woman.
Renata Atal.
russian expat wanted in connection with multiple murder-for-hires involving unusual weapons.
a motorized garrote would qualify.
I already put out the BOLO. We know who's after Benin.
which means we can get her back to protect her.
no, we can't.
DiNozzo and McGee get this?
they weren't in the bullpen.
get it to their cell phone now.
okay. Uh, why?
let me go to your news media.
if I cannot win your sympathy, then-then maybe...
I get it, okay?
you'll help me?
no.
you're not worth starting a war over, but like I said, I get it.
thank you for that, at least.
why are we in here?
what's happening?
hello.
stay in the car.
Tony, I think we're being followed.
you are.
what? Where-where are you?
following you.
and our hit woman now.
what? The whole time?
Yeah, I had a hunch.
now, stay in the car, Leia.
Tony, what are you gonna do?
well...
he hung up?
uh, what do we do now?
get down.
turn off the engine.
hands on the wheel!
it's over.
I know.
Hey, hands on the wheel!
no, no, no, no, no, stop!
how did this woman know I was being transferred?
first you refuse to grant me asylum.
then you use me as bait to lure my assassin out into the open.
and now you still plan on turning me in to those responsible?
we don't have proof.
outside of this building, Counselor Pavlenko was the only one who knew I was being transferred.
it does appear someone tipped off the hit woman.
Yeah, and it still wasn't me.
I ask about treason one time.
enough!
what do we got?
well, dwindling shot clock.
the Russians are expecting their scientist back.
I would rather die than be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life.
we still don't have enough evidence to connect Pavlenko to the rogue Russians or to Mishnev.
body.
headless hit woman's with Ducky.
and her SUV is down in the garage.
Abby's on it, but no word yet.
then you don't know what we've got.
well, I...
I need Gibbs.
Oh. Uh, yes. Director, hold on.
uh, it's Director Vance. He's looking for you, boss.
Yeah, I'll bet he is.
you know, he's not here right now.
I could ta...
Hello? He hung up.
Oh, can't imagine.
excuse me?
Pendergast! With me!
the Berserkers of Old Norse literature were known for fighting in a bloodthirsty and trancelike state.
hence, the term "going berserk
Yeah. One theory suggests that it was the ingestion of a hallucinogenic mushroom, the Amanita muscaria, that made these warriors lose their heads, so to speak.
that's not what made our killer lose hers.
and Miss Atal preferred dope.
uh, we used to call it "Mary Jane," Miss, uh...?
Ah.
Oh, well, uh, her body reeked of the drug, so she wasn't in a berserk fury.
she would find herself relaxed and mildly euphoric as she killed others.
doubt her own death felt very good.
well, facing a lifetime of prison, suicide was no doubt preferable, and it would have prevented her from being questioned.
duck, tell me you got something.
well, plenty of something to suggest that she killed our Navy scientist.
the-the murder weapon, the similar markings on the neck.
we need her employer. -Well, that's something that the body did not provide.
you.
Abby. -Um, I processed the weed residue on our third garrote.
it matches the first two.
definitely our killer.
we know. The SUV?
still processing that, but so far, nada, zilch.
but before you ask, I ran deep background on both Renata Atal and Anton Pavlenko.
what's the connection?
our hit woman was a pro, Gibbs, so, if Pavlenko is connected to her...
he's no dummy, either.
we just need more time.
time's up, Agent Gibbs.
and there's nothing we can do to delay this further.
we have our, um... we have our murderer.
it's time to give the Russians what they want.
Ah.
came yourself this time, Anton.
my people are waiting with the plane.
I was hoping we could talk.
right.
you tell Sergei I said howdy.
what would make you think he and I are friendly?
you lied.
you're lying right now.
if I motivated you to find Benin faster, then it was worth it, so you could protect her, prevent escalation, war, even.
we're already fighting one.
Yes, and we are on the same side.
against Sergei.
look, I had nothing to do with those deaths.
how can I prove that to you?
perhaps... next time?
I know where to find you.
no, no. No, I won't go.
not with him. - Take it easy, or you'll be flying in handcuffs. Come on.
I hope that will not be necessary, Miss Benin.
I give you my word, we will return you home peacefully and safely.
no. No. No!
don't do this.
stand down, DiNozzo.
agent Gibbs, do something.
for God's sake, somebody do something!
what did you do?
my job.
I guess Benin was dangerous after all.
but don't worry.
I will tell Moscow the truth when I get back.
the truth?
you're gonna tell the truth?
that the Americans were of great help, and that she is no longer a threat or our concern.
but it didn't have to end like this,
so, Pavlenko wanted her dead?
this proves he's behind the hit woman and part of the Russian terrorist group.
Yeah, maybe, but with diplomatic immunity...
Where's Gibbs?
right here, Madam Secretary.
save the formality.
how the hell did this happen in our own house?!
thank you.
that was base security.
Pavlenko has left the Navy Yard.
madam Secretary.
Oh, I usually used glycerin to get out stains.
Yeah, well, I have some in Autopsy.
you said give the Russians what they want.
we did.
you had blanks in your gun?
hunter knows what weapon to use to get the job done.
and you and Gibbs didn't tell me?
it was my one condition for going along with this whole crazy thing.
I see.
so... this isn't 'cause I'm... better at my job?
what?
Yeah, you know, the stall tactics on you, following you to get to the hit woman.
Oh, and you think that was because...
smarter. Me.
what about the fact that I used my contacts with the Russians to sell this whole damn thing?
dangerous. You.
you're unbelievable.
thank you. Now, about getting that phone number in writing.
you're the detective, Tony.
you know what "Tony" is spelled backwards?
why not?
think about it.
you overheard that.
didn't have a choice.
Gibbs would never leave you out of the loop on something like this.
he didn't.
you knew? You were just...
wait. So, why bother fighting with her?
she fights back.
I have a type.
I've tracked the final suspect.
compartment two tack eight-four tack two.
NCIS! Hands in the air!
I said, "Hands in the air!"
you're dead, Bishop.
I know.
you have pointy elbows.
I failed.
not exactly.
attention, all trainees,
you heard Gibbs. I-I died.
there's no coming back from that.
you are aware that you didn't actually die and this is just a training exercise?
he won't even look at me.
it's a silent form of encouragement.
DiNozzo. - Ah.
if it isn't the Julie McCoy of our little training exercise.
heard you were knocking boots with Leia Pendergast.
from who?
from Leia. We Soul Cycle.
it's a form of exercise, DiNozzo.
I know.
well, Leia's fun, but it just sort of didn't work out.
sort of a dalliance.
calm down, DiNozzo. I'm not your conscience.
dally who you want.
this is CGIS Special Agent Abigail Borin.
she's into cardio and interagency gossip.
Borin, this is...
I observed your exercise.
it was passable work for a probie.
Mmm. See? You didn't fail. You passed.
I-I need to go again.
there are no do-overs in training.
but hang in there.
you're doing fine.
I don't get it.
I-I mean, I did everything right.
I-I followed procedure to the letter.
I could've sworn there was only one suspect left.
it's not always about procedure.
it's about this...
and this...
and these.
360-degree awareness.
comes with experience.
right, Borin?
Gibbs, what do you see?
I don't know. There's something out there.
at your two o'clock.
man overboard! - Man overboard!
the X. O. confirms all Navy and Coast Guard personnel are accounted for.
whoever the victim is, he's not from this ship.
according to his I. D. he's Joe Willis, crew member from the San Dominick.
civilian, probably.
cause of death? - Corpsman found water in his lungs when he tried to resuscitate him, but it's too soon to tell.
Bishop, what do you see?
no bloating. - Yeah. Which means what?
he hasn't been floating out here long.
couple hours?
Yeah, and...?
he's got a gash on his forehead and bruising on his skin.
he was in a fight.
or he fell 50 feet off the side of a ship. Could be an accident.
San Dominick is a cargo ship that left port in Norfolk three hours ago.
anybody notice they're one man short?
well, it's hard to say.
they're not responding to any of our calls.
complete radio silence.
that's not the only thing. Look at this.
the San Dominick is supposed to be heading to the Port of Bilbao, Spain.
they're off course.
heading south.
the San Dominick is American owned, - but Panamanian flagged. - Both our jurisdictions.
no Coast Guard patrols in the area.
we're the closest vessel.
how far? - 60 nautical miles.
we can be there in a couple hours.
pack your bag.
you're escorting the body back to NCIS.
we're going after the San Dominick.
Ah, the trainee returns. How'd it go?
I don't want to talk about it.
that good, huh? - I just spent the last hour on the choppiest helo ride of my life, clutching a dead body so it didn't shift because the tie-down rings were loose.
it was the high point of my morning.
you run background on our victim?
Yeah. The company that owns the San Dominick
Stalten Shipping-- sent me Joe Willis's employee records.
40 years old. From Dover, Delaware.
lives in Norfolk.
served 15 years in the Navy. He's ready reserve.
Yeah. Hired as security last month for Stalten's transatlantic runs.
why does a cargo ship need an armed guard?
piracy, terrorism.
shipping companies like to be prepared.
well, Ducky's starting his autopsy, so we'll know if it was murder soon.
do you want to talk about that test now?
no.
okay.
it's just...
I did everything right.
I mean, I was textbook.
how could I fail?
everybody fails. It's the Kobayashi Maru.
the Kobayashi Ma-what?
the Kobayashi Maru. It's from The Wrath of Khan.
star Wars again? - Star Trek.
same difference. - No, no, no.
no. See, Star Wars is grounded in mythology.
star Trek is grounded in science...
Tim. Focus.
right. Kobayashi Maru was a training exercise on the Enterprise.
it's a lose-lose scenario. No matter what choice you make, you're not gonna win.
that-that's cheating.
it's supposed to build character.
by cheating? - Look, Bishop, all I'm saying is you shouldn't feel bad about this, okay?
nobody passes this training exercise.
not me. Not Tony. Not Captain Kirk.
well, technically, Kirk...
what about Gibbs? - Gibbs?
Oh, he passed. - How?
he's Gibbs.
Yeah.
boarding party to USS Serano.
we are on board the San Dominick. Over.
boarding party, roger.
we'll await your sitrep.
special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.
this is Special Agent Borin, - CGIS. - We speeding, Officer?
sorry.
bad joke. It's not every day you're pulled over by a Navy cruiser.
Where's the captain?
below deck.
I'm James Meyer, first mate.
what can I do you for? - Get the captain.
he's a little busy captaining right now, but he'll be up soon.
maybe I can help. You aware you're off course?
sure.
there's, uh, inclement weather ahead.
we're just trying to avoid it.
Yeah, well you're not answering your radio, either.
Yeah, comm's on the fritz.
that's what the captain's working on right now.
and all crew is accounted for?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I feel like we're not on the same page.
what's this about?
Joe Willis. Your security officer.
he in some kind of trouble?
well, yeah, you could say that.
holy crap.
same page now?
I knew it. I'm cursed.
first the radio, then the weather, now this... terrible accident.
can you tell us where Joe Willis was supposed to be, Captain?
doing his rounds.
security check, I guess. Must have slipped off deck.
did he?
what are you thinking?
don't know. Body's being examined.
we need a manifest and a crew list.
Why?
cause we're gonna question them.
now?
what is it with the people on this ship?
Yes, now. A man is dead.
by accident. Now, look, I appreciate your position, but you need to appreciate mine.
I'm-I'm three hours off schedule.
gee, that's... that's rough.
I... I get it.
I get it. You're investigating a crime.
but from my perspective, we're just all trying to make a living here.
now, can't we handle this after we've finished our run?
no.
I'm telling you, as captain of this ship, there is absolutely nothing illegal or suspicious...
captain, you o... you okay?
just need to sit.
you've been stabbed.
I need to get you back to our ship, Captain.
our victim was in a fight.
note the defensive wounds.
probably caused by a knife and received while fending off what could have been a violent attack.
was he stabbed?
no. No, no.
the ship's doctor was correct in the manner of death.
this man drowned.
however, the water in his lungs was not seawater.
I'm waiting for a confirmation from Abby, but my guess is that it was potable water, for use aboard the San Dominick.
confirms Joe Willis was murdered.
that I cannot say.
you just told me Joe Willis drowned on the San Dominick.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
I said this man drowned on the San Dominick.
but this man is not Joe Willis.
according to his records,
Joe Willis served for 15 years in the Navy.
that's right. - The autopsy showed that this man suffered from renal agenesis.
it's a birth defect that has no discernible effects on living a normal, healthy life, with the possible exception of passing the medical examination to serve in the armed forces.
since there's no waiver for enlistees with only one kidney.
if this isn't Joe Willis, then who is he?
Ah...
skipper gonna be okay?
special Agent Borin is escorting him to our ship's corpsman.
I can't believe this is happening.
captain O'Rourke and Joe Willis
they have any problems?
skipper doesn't have problems.
everyone loves him.
Oh, my God.
not everybody.
holy crap.
what the hell happened in here?
excuse me.
you and I need to talk.
alone.
Hey.
it's not a request.
petty Officer, remove this man from the radio room.
Yes, sir.
this radio has been sabotaged.
holy... - Stop.
I have no... - Don't.
busted radio, dead security officer, wounded captain and him.
Renaldo? He's...
he's wearing canvas shoes, not steel-toed boots.
who is he?
because he is not part of your crew.
captain's stable, but he lost a lot of blood.
knife nicked an artery.
security officer's not a security officer, and Ducky says our dead guy was an impostor.
you tell Gibbs?
I was just about to.
it's Abby. - What's up, Abbs?
Hey. I got a positive I. D. on our drowning victim.
his name is Ernesto Vilandro.
he's Venezuelan, and he's wanted in five countries.
for what? - Piracy, Tony.
I e-mailed you his file and a list of all known associates.
got it.
I know that man.
he's the engineer on the San Dominick.
tell Gibbs now. I'm going back on that ship.
thank you, Abby.
Gibbs, come in. It's Tony.
the man we found in the water is wanted for piracy.
there's at least another pirate on that ship.
Renaldo Aranda, the engineer.
ship's been compromised.
watch your six. Over.
don't answer.
spotter saw armed men leading members of the boarding party below deck.
ship's compromised.
what about Gibbs?
no word.
how does a band of armed pirates sneak onto a U. S. cargo ship without anyone noticing?
kind of hoping you'd tell us.
our victim, Ernesto Vilandro, got on impersonating the security officer.
and the real security officer is...?
Joe Willis-- last seen at a Norfolk bar ten days ago.
got his home address. Heading there now.
cross-reference crew records on the San Dominick.
verify identities.
we got to weed out if there's another impostor.
and find out if Vilandro has any more associates in the area.
on it. - Who's in charge here?
I am. - I am.
it's CAMSLANT, Chesapeake, calling from shore.
Yeah, - I... I'll...
I got this.
Vilandro was smart.
knew the crews on these ships change all the time.
no one would know he was an impostor.
someone realized, Tony.
I got a report from Interpol.
last time Vilandro took a ship was two years ago, outside the Port of Santos.
he held its captain for ten days during a standoff with the Brazilian navy.
somehow escaped when they forcibly boarded.
the man he held hostage was Tom O'Rourke, captain of the San Dominick.
he happen to mention that to you when he was brought on board?
no. Uh, he was too busy bleeding from a stab wound, but I'll be sure to bring it up.
now, look, Gibbs isn't there.
me, neither.
listen, McGee, you're the boss now.
me? Whoa, whoa, Tony...
don't mess it up.
guess you're the boss, boss.
can he even do that?
this is the USS Serano.
come in, San Dominick.
repeat: This is the USS Serano.
come in, San Dominick. - Can't think. Turn it down.
over. - How many crew on board?
twelve.
how many hijackers?
no talking.
how many?
I think six or...
I say shut up!
Vámonos.
Where's the crew being held?
he told us to be quiet. - Where?
mess deck, all right? Now, can we just...?
please.
you hanging in there, Petty Officer?
trying, sir.
can't seem to stop the bleeding.
feeling dizzy.
what's your name?
petty Officer Felton.
no. What's your first name?
people call you Patty?
you hate being called Patty.
that's it.
you just keep laughing, Patricia.
breathe.
three in, three out.
what the hell are you doing?
she's bleeding, man.
she can't stop it.
I can.
by threatening to shoot her?
who says it's a threat?
you're in way over your head.
he's the leader, right?
he's gone. Now it's me.
well, then lead.
answer the damn walkie.
get your ransom and get off this boat.
breathe.
in-- one, two, three.
attention, USS Serano.
this is the San Dominick.
we read you, San Dominick.
this is NCIS Special Agent DiNozzo.
we want $10 million in unmarked bills delivered in one hour's time, or I'll shoot a hostage and toss them overboard.
this is Special Agent Abigail Borin.
is this Renaldo Aranda? Look, uh, we're happy to talk to you about money, but first we need a status report on the...
you now have 59 minutes.
open up. NCIS.
Mr. Willis, we need to ask you a few questions.
what do we do, boss?
please stop calling me that.
unlocked. - Mmm.
Ah, it's every smell I can't stand rolled into...
one super smell.
Yeah. Willis lived alone.
I don't know why it looks like a frat party exploded.
kitchen or bathroom? Where do you want me?
take the kitchen.
okay.
got boxes of ammo.
7. 62 millimeter.
a lot of them.
guess we know where the hijackers were staying.
Yeah, I think I know how they snuck on the San Dominick, too.
falsified their I. D.'s and walked on with the rest of the crew.
that leaves two questions:
was Joe Willis a conspirator?
and... what exactly is in this jar?
it's...
you understand?
would it have killed them to use the bathroom?
I'm gonna go with yes.
flight deck, stand by.
hot refuel in progress.
all others, stand clear of the flight deck.
give us a second? Thanks.
sir.
captain?
security team Bravo, security team Bravo...
where am I?
on the USS Serano.
and my ship?
it's being held by pirates.
I should be there. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
you're not going anywhere, except a medevac to Norfolk.
I, uh...
I had a package of chew in my shirt pocket.
is there any chance that's around?
your shirt's in an evidence bag. - Ah.
time I quit anyway. It's a bad habit.
so you want to tell me what happened?
trip like this, your eyes scan the horizon for pirates.
never expected them to be part of my own crew.
Yeah, that's what's giving me trouble.
you didn't notice that the guy that took your boat hostage today is the same guy who took you hostage two years ago?
I did notice. There's not a detail about Ernesto Vilandro I haven't committed to memory.
I had to stop him.
hijackers had locked the crew up in the mess.
but Vilandro needed me to work the comm.
it was just him and me.
you jumped him?
I wasn't giving up my ship. Not to Vilandro, not again.
radio got smashed in the fight.
I threw Vilandro overboard, hoped somebody would find the body.
Helo's ready, sir.
copy that.
O'Rourke's medevac left.
he's on the route to Norfolk.
hour's up. Time to contact Aranda.
so, what are you gonna say to him when he asks for his money?
well, Tony, I'm gonna ask him his preference in powerboats.
did you know there are 17 distinct categories - of fast boats? - I did not.
it's Hostage Negotiation 101, DiNozzo.
you keep them stalled, keep them calm, keep them talking.
just like dating.
you ready?
Oh, yeah.
this is the USS Serano to the San Dominick. Come in.
you have my money?
we're close.
my boss signed off on the request.
the bank's processing it.
shouldn't be long. - You're stalling, and it won't work.
look, you asked for $10 million.
it's a little more complicated than a walk down to the ATM.
so, while we're waiting for your money, why don't we talk escape boats?
I like the bowrider myself.
I don't want a damn boat.
this isn't a negotiation. It's a demand.
blood's on your hands now.
okay. All right, hold on.
let's just take a breath.
we don't need any more blood.
Hello?
on your feet. Get up now! - What?
come on, man! Let her go, let her go.
you want to take her place?!
huh?!
I do.
I don't care how you get it.
San Dominick, come in. This is USS Serano.
I have your cash, but I need you to respond. Over.
Oh, now you have the money, huh?
it's close.
I'd say 30 minutes.
okay, seriously, I will take counterfeit.
hell, I will take Monopoly money.
maybe 40.
still stalling. You're still trying to trick me.
the only way you take me seriously is with a bullet.
look, we're getting your money, and as soon as we do,
I will bring it to you personally.
you and how many snipers, huh?
no snipers.
no tricks; just me.
and I'm supposed to believe you?
look, you chose this line of work.
you kicked our hornet's nest.
I'm just saying nobody else has to get hurt.
you're wrong, though.
your man's going to be hurt.
my man?
you mean Gibbs?
I'm going to make an example of him.
Muévete! Move!
Hey, man, listen. I get it.
Gibbs can be grumpy, incommunicative, stubborn.
that's no reason... - Enough. Say good-bye.
I'm working with you here.
well, now, because I have the power, and you people, you people...
Hello?
is anybody there?
I need a response. I need to talk to Gibbs right now.
Hey, Tony. It's me.
I'm fine.
can't say the same for Aranda.
I know, in the end, we all must die.
and I am not a religious person.
but I find desecration of the human body to be positively indecent.
well, pirates aren't known for their decency, Duck.
something wrong? -No, Timothy, but I requested you dispense with the coffee before joining me.
Joe Willis drown?
the cause of death was asphyxiation.
and the bathtub he was floating in?
Mr. Willis was most likely left in the water to control odor and decomposition.
can being submerged in water control decomp?
not water alone, but as you can see, there are traces of chemicals on his skin, specifically benzethonium chloride, cetrimide and good old-fashioned ammonia.
these would certainly slow the decaying of the tissue.
how long has he been dead?
it's hard to be precise.
five to seven days.
the killer or killers clearly wanted to preserve his body.
while they used his apartment while planning their hijacking.
Thanks, Duck.
stay still.
that's all you're gonna do?
I'm stopping the bleeding.
I need medical attention.
what you need to do... is respond to your friend.
and tell him you're bueno.
or I can just untie this.
okay. Okay.
okay. Okay.
now... you talk.
what do you want? What-what... what do you want to hear?
you told me that you're the leader.
the leader-- he knows.
Vilandro-- he was the real leader.
outfitted us, got us fake papers.
what's the plan?
we...
we take the boat out of port.
then we contact the shipping company for ransom.
then escape boat comes and meets us.
simple, clean.
you can't contact the shipping company.
you destroyed the radio. - That wasn't us.
Vilandro-- he went to the radio room with the captain, and they fought.
everything fell apart after that.
I saw you and four others.
you have another man on this ship.
you think you're in control now, but you're not. When the others come, - they're gonna kill you. - Who's the sixth man?
wait.
where is he?
deck four.
Vilandro sent him there to guard a shipping container right before the fight with the captain.
I don't know why. I swear.
I swear. I swear.
now, you were telling me, who is in control?
what did you find, Bishop?
anything interesting? - Tons.
it's Vilandro's computer from Joe Willis's place.
it's filled with encrypted e-mails.
shipping timetables, port security codes, petty-cash drops for the hijackers.
I mean, someone planned and financed this whole operation.
just can't tell you who yet.
what do you got, Abbs?
well, uh, I've been combing through all the evidence from Joe Willis's apartment.
What'd you find in this garbage?
it may look like garbage to the untrained eye, but to me, every moldy food wrapper and every soggy cigarette butt
it just fills in a vast mosaic.
details, Abbs.
um, well, one of our hijackers, uh, is lactose intolerant.
uh, two others are vegetarians.
one is suffering from IBS.
fewer details, Abbs.
I'm running eight distinct DNA samples to try to I. D. the hijackers.
I'm just waiting for results.
what about the chemicals
Ducky found on Joe Willis's body?
dead-animal deodorizer, and a lot of it.
my dad always had a jug of that stuff when I was growing up.
covers the smell and stops the infestation of flies.
and you use enough of it, it'll do the same thing for a dead man.
anything else? - Um...
just these numbers.
uh, Gibbs found them on a slip of paper at the crime scene on the San Dominick.
I'm not sure what they are yet, but I am all over it.
it's good work, Abbs.
gosh, I just got chills.
why is that?
you're just... changing right in front of our eyes.
your gruff manner, your...
your clipped replies.
you're no longer McGee.
you're McGibbs.
What?! That's...
wait. What?!
it's true.
ever since Tony put you in charge.
you're, like... channeling him.
stop it. - You got it, boss.
Hey, MSRT's ready when you are.
Abby got positive I. D.'s on several of the hijackers.
it doesn't add up.
look like an evil boy band. - Exactly.
matches came from the Brazilian DNA database.
so they all have criminal records?
you know, car theft, shoplifting.
none of them are serious felons.
Yeah. Someone smuggled them over the border, financed them and sent them onto the San Dominick.
pirates usually aren't sophisticated enough to falsify I. D.'s and override security systems.
these pirates were. - We're missing something.
well, maybe we'll find it on that boat.
I've already told you, we do not comment on active operations.
you want to try calling my boss, go right ahead.
got to go now. Bye.
go for McGee.
Dorneget?
don't have any updates yet. Tony and Borin are taking the ship now. I'm waiting for a sitrep.
got to go, Ned.
well, I see you didn't waste any time going over my...
Oh, Director.
uh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.
never mind.
Yes. Uh, no, nothing yet.
I will.
Thanks.
Bishop, phone's ringing.
Bishop?! - You say something?
Yeah. What do you got?
Oh. Um, I ran a trace on these encrypted e-mails.
they were buried in a Trojan horse that bounced all over the country through infected host computers.
so, I pinpointed the origin, and it's a Kinko's outside Norfolk.
Oh, our mastermind's a local.
they have dozens of customers renting computer time by the hour.
we'll need more if we want to zero in on a suspect.
I know what the numbers mean.
I know what the numbers mean. I know what the numbers mean.
McGee, what are you doing?
what? I'm just standing. - At Gibbs' desk.
Abby, you said you know what the number means.
what numbers?
the numbers...
that Gibbs found at the crime scene.
I thought maybe they were lottery numbers or coordinates.
but I was wrong, but I was kind of right.
explain.
it's a locator number for a shipping container from the San Dominick.
what's inside?
it's not what's in the shipping container that's important. It's who owns it.
a company called LCD Liquidated.
they have a cursory Web site, and a voice mail, and about 50 shipping containers that are traveling around the world pretty much constantly.
usually export out of the U. S.
and ending up in countries with secretive banking practices.
and they are being investigated by U. S. Customs for money smuggling.
drug money, specifically.
I'm talking tens of millions of dollars in one container.
this isn't about ransom at all.
rule number 70-- keep digging till you hit bottom.
there is no rule 70.
well, I'm... - You just made up a rule.
this McGibbs thing has really gone to your head.
I don't even recognize you right now.
we heard that gunshot before.
we were sure you were dead.
Patricia?
they took her right after Aranda grabbed you.
well, where is she?
what happened to you, man?
you sent her down here to be a hostage.
my insurance policy.
Where's the container he was supposed to be guarding?
it's this one.
he probably got lost somewhere down here, but this is the container.
sit down.
boss, where are you?
deck four.
we've taken the ship.
we have the rest of the hijackers.
we're on our way.
is that a bomb?
just to be clear...
that's not our bomb.
drop it.
now!
you want to tell your boy here to ease up on his trigger finger?
soon as you and your people leave this ship.
turn off your bomb, we'll talk about it.
I already told you, it's not our bomb.
then whose is it? -Don't know.
but it's going off one way or another.
not if I disarm it.
you can do that?
do it.
drop the weapon first and release the petty officer.
you down here, boss?
got a bomb down here, DiNozzo!
I need you to evacuate the ship.
we need to evacuate the ship.
we have a bomb on four.
we already left you on this ship once.
you see how much trouble you got into?
I guess it's up to you, Jaime.
well, you're scared.
means you're smart.
a smart man wouldn't be here.
got you covered, boss.
how's the timer on that bomb looking?
less than three minutes. - I just spoke to McGee.
he said the empty container was supposed to be filled with drug money.
Hey. Where's the money?
the container was empty when I got here.
millions of dollars don't just walk off.
the only thing we wanted was ransom.
then the escape boat comes and...
and we go home.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clean and simple.
you told that story before.
you said you didn't want a boat.
because you were expecting one.
Yeah. And it'll be here.
soon.
one of our agents found the operational plans for this hijacking, and here's the thing.
not one word about an escape boat.
what are you saying?
there is no boat.
you were never supposed to get away.
you were set up to take the fall on this ship.
you steal tens of millions of dollars from the cartel, they will come after you.
but not if you're already dead.
that's what the bomb was for.
it's like Die Hard on a ship.
one minute, Gibbs.
come on, man. You're a fool.
time to end this.
...listen to him.
there's no boat. There's no...
no way out.
you need to give up, man. -No!
shoot him, sir. I'll take my chances.
Yeah, you got it. - Everybody shut up!
35 seconds.
running out of time, boss.
Jaime, you got two choices:
you drop the weapon and I defuse the bomb, or I shoot you and I defuse the bomb.
20 seconds.
boss?
okay.
twelve.
what-what are you doing? Defuse it!
please. - Ten.
Gibbs, the bomb.
five -Boss?
you removed that when you first saw the bomb, didn't you?
you okay?
this is Special Agent Abigail Borin.
the San Dominick is secure.
bringing up two prisoners and we need immediate medical attention for a petty officer.
money was never on the ship. Someone took it off.
Uh-huh. Boy, that bomb thing, that was kind of fun.
right? Next time, you might want to give us a heads-up, though, 'cause...
I didn't pack a diaper.
Oh, what do we have here?
what do you got?
bad habit.
Hey.
I brought this to the hospital this morning.
I couldn't find you. Old Pelton, right?
that's my brand. Yeah.
we matched it to the spit we found in the container, right next to the bomb you rigged.
got your DNA, too.
I don't know what...
hands up.
where I can see them.
up.
you're a clever guy, Captain.
planned a hijacking as a distraction while you robbed the cartels.
we almost didn't catch you.
only we found security footage of you buying $1, 000 worth of dead-animal deodorizer.
two blocks from the Kinko's where you sent encrypted e-mails to the gang that couldn't shoot straight.
Yeah. You dream that up with your pal Vilandro while he held you hostage?
or maybe he was the brains, the Butch to your Sundance.
only Sundance wouldn't drown Butch during a knife fight, would he?
wouldn't treat a friend like that.
he wasn't my friend.
just a business partner.
we're not getting through, are we?
that's all right.
I have a feeling that the cartels have people that can be... very persuasive.
that bastard tortured me for ten days, made me beg for my life, humiliated me and then somehow thought I was going into business with him.
I only needed him to set up the hijacking.
you always planned to kill him.
he figured out I'd taken the money off the container before we even left port.
he was angry.
he got what he deserved.
so will you.
Hey. Still here, Borin?
admit it, I'm growing on you.
like a barnacle.
no, I'm just transferring O'Rourke to Federal Detention, and then I am gone.
well, good working with you.
Hey, you know, if you ever want to make a change, there's room on my team.
be your number two?
Oh, no, no, no. Omagi's my number two.
but you'd make a solid number three.
see you!
I just want you to know I'm proud of you.
you didn't blow anything up, and there were no international incidents.
you're gonna make a good boss someday.
thank you, Tony.
so, I watched Star Trek II last night.
Kobayashi Maru.
I totally get it now.
I figured out how Gibbs passed the boarding exercise.
he fixed it. Just...
like Captain Kirk. Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna ask him about it tomorrow.
you're going to accuse the boss of cheating on an official test?
sounded better in my head.
this is what happens when I'm not around for a little while.
walk with me, Bishop. Let me explain.
the things that happen in your head, - Mm-hmm.
they don't all have to happen in the real world.
you see, you can keep some of those things inside the head.
you can? -You can.
it's called an inner life.
Really?
rule 70, McGee?
I can't see.
move over.
are you crazy?
old Man Hawkins sees the light through the garage, he'll call the cops, and we'll have records.
how is he gonna see a light through the wall?
besides, you know how many video games one coin from a treasure chest can buy?
whoa.
war stuff.
don't touch that!
you could get lice!
what is that?
he kills people in here.
no, that's him.
that's Old Man Hawkins.
he followed me for, like, two blocks.
I couldn't just shut the door on him.
I didn't think you liked cats.
I don't.
I gave the landlord 48 hours, find him another place to live, or his furry ass is out on the street.
good, that's good.
got to say something about that cat, though.
there's something...
he's thoughtful.
yesterday, he spent an hour grooming my arm.
Hey, what about your fish?
Ah, that was tricky.
Kate and Ziva are now in the bathroom, on the counter, door closed.
problem solved.
nice.
what's happening?
my overall field training evaluation from Gibbs.
Ah...
the probie eval.
nine months of training, culminating in one debilitating document.
Yeah. - What'd you get?
no idea, I'm afraid to open it.
it's just a matter of managing your expectations.
might help you to know that I got a 63.
out of 100?
Yeah, it's par for the course.
Kate, who was the girl before the girl...
What'd she get, like, a 60?
and then Ziva had a...
she refused to tell us.
well, what about you, Tony?
Ah, big fat 58.
I wore that score like a badge of honor.
okay.
expectations managed.
holy crap.
single digits?
no.
no, I got an 82.
what?
Wow. - Yeah, wow.
I can't believe it.
I mean, an 82, this is incredible.
what?
grab your gear, that's what.
where we headed to, boss?
body at Norfolk.
base PPV housing.
I got the outside taped off.
neighborhood watch is starting to assemble.
anything worth writing down?
Hmm...
they all said the same thing.
victim kept to himself, spent a lot of time out here in his garage.
what do we know?
well, the victim is George Hawkins.
65 years old, retired master sergeant.
27 years in the Corps.
clocked out as an operations chief.
career Marine.
he's been living here in Public/Private Venture Housing ever since DoD opened it up to retirees.
got a blood trail.
Yeah, looks like he could have been dragged.
two gunshot wounds to the chest.
Where's Ducky?
he's on his way.
he's got something in his hand.
Yeah, boss. - Get his hand.
dog tag?
could be our killer. - Not a bad thought.
there's a scuffle before he's shot, the master sergeant rips the tag off his killer, CJ Kent.
I don't think so.
why not?
because Sergeant Charles J. Kent's been dead for 45 years.
he was killed in action in the Vietnam War.
so then how did his dog tag end up in the hand of our victim?
Gibbs should be here any minute.
Tony's not back yet?
no, he's still processing Hawkins' garage.
can't believe he volunteered to do that.
Yeah, he said he needed some alone time to think about cat issues.
Yeah, like that's not weird.
okay, so we will count Tony out.
you want to give the stats on Hawkins, and then I'll chime in?
what, are you writing a script for the update?
I just want to be prepared.
getting an 82 on my eval,
I feel like I need to keep earning it.
and I don't even know how I got it in the first place.
Yeah.
okay, update. Let's go.
okay.
retired Master Sergeant George Hawkins murdered yesterday, discovered holding the dog tag of Charles J. Kent.
sergeant Kent was KIA in Vietnam in 1969.
connection?
they served together.
boot camp to Vietnam.
sergeant Kent head Hawkins by one rank.
he was actually Hawkins' squad leader.
on July 17, 1969, they were on a reconnaissance mission in Quang Tri Province.
the patrol was ambushed by the Vietcong.
sergeant Kent was one of four Marines killed in the fight.
following day, all bodies were recovered, except for Sergeant Kent's.
JPAC, which stands for the Joint P. O.W./M. I.A. Accounting Command, and you already know that.
uh, JPAC recently did an excavation of the ambush site.
turned up nothing.
to date, Sergeant Kent's remains are unaccounted for.
JPAC find his dog tags?
there's no record of Sergeant Kent's dog tags being recovered by anyone.
we don't know where Hawkins got the one he was holding.
but we did find someone who might have an idea.
phone records show a large number of calls between Hawkins and Kent's daughter.
daughter's name is Alice Kent Staley.
bring her in. - Already did.
she's waiting in the conference room for you.
that's good work.
McGee, give DiNozzo a hand.
Bishop, go check in with Ducky.
you were a Marine.
I can see it all over you.
Yeah, well...
I joined because of guys like your dad.
couple years older than me.
I saw them run straight into the fire.
hawk would have liked you.
master Sergeant Hawkins?
Yes, Hawk.
anyone who knew him called him that.
how long have you known him?
um, when he came home from the war, I was just a baby.
he felt it was his duty to watch over me.
every toothache, holiday, the birth of my daughter,
hawk was there.
do you know where he got your father's dog tag?
uh, I-I didn't know he had it.
he never wanted to get my hopes up about his research, so...
research?
my father's remains were never recovered.
he was looking for Sergeant Kent.
he always talked about what it would mean to bring my father home.
as he got older, it consumed him.
hawk saw my father get hit.
he held the body.
to not be able to find it the next day was devastating.
hawk loved him.
I know by the way he loved me.
we're not gonna stop until we know who killed him.
how am I gonna tell my daughter?
I mean, Greta's... she's only eight.
and she adored Hawk.
he was, uh, making these videos for her.
stories about her granddad.
he wanted her to know who he was.
master Sergeant Hawkins knew the end was near.
he knew he was gonna get shot?
no, Eleanor, he knew he was going to die.
ductal adenocarcinoma.
pancreatic cancer.
patient records show that Master Sergeant Hawkins was diagnosed last month.
the cancer was too advanced for any treatment.
so, had he not been shot...
well, he would have had only a few months to live.
can't imagine knowing you're gonna die.
we sent the slugs up to Abby.
she confirmed that they're 0. 38 Specials.
a bullet commonly used in revolvers.
hmm, okay.
Thanks, Ducky, I'll follow up.
Eleanor, can I have a word with you before you go?
uh, sure, what's up?
well, today is a difficult day.
it is?
you've been training for nine months now.
nine months, such a magical time frame, isn't it?
but think, in three months,
Breena and I are gonna have our own little human, who hopefully enjoys long walks...
sorry, this is about you.
your field training evaluation.
Oh, right. Well, actually I...
allow me to impart a little bit of wisdom that I have given to each and every aspiring agent before you, on this, your Probie Eval Day.
don't fret your number.
Jethro gives low scores, well, to push you.
wait, what?
the lower your score, the more potential Gibbs thinks you have.
uh, so if you got a high score?
well, then I would advise you to turn in your badge.
I thought I had this working.
Oh, there we go.
Greta, hi, honey.
your old pal Hawk here.
uh, I'm gonna be telling you everything I can about your granddad.
so you have it.
uh, as you know, his name was Sergeant Charles Kent.
and, um...
he was a hell of a Marine.
hell of a man.
there's a bunch of video files on here.
there's a whole bunch of pretty much everything in this place.
you know, being in here, surrounded by one man's quest to find his friend and give him a proper burial, it's really made me think about...
the importance of friendship.
wow, thanks, Tony.
Oh, not you.
this is the cat you found.
Yeah.
Rick Blaine, I named himafter Humphrey Bogart's character in Casablanca, 'cause of the fur tuxedo.
you named him?
Yeah, I'm gonna keep him.
"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
well, I don't know.
you sure about that, Tony?
look around, Tim.
you can't fight the male bond.
it's epic.
Yeah, epic and expensive.
Hawkins invested a lot of money in his search for Kent's remains.
who was he paying?
well, these are all receipts from private organizations,
pis, anyone who said they could help.
money, the root of all evil.
Yeah, problem is
I'm not finding any kind of motive.
what are you doing?
I think we should get all this stuff to the master.
if anyone ever breathed on these papers while thinking about killing Hawkins,
Abby will know it.
I have news, I have lots of news, I have big news.
the edge of my seat, Abbs.
okay, first of all, this is not Sergeant Kent's dog tag.
whose is it?
it's nobody's.
it was made on an old graphotype machine, but the stainless steel is new.
it was artificially weathered using hydrochloric acid and steel wool, which left little particles that rusted.
it's a fake.
exactly.
there's more
look at the blood type.
b positive?
sergeant Kent was B negative.
now, after all the effort that Hawkins has put into the search, there is no way he doesn't know Sergeant Kent's blood type.
Hawkins knew the tag was fake.
Yep.
the blood trail.
originally, I thought that Hawkins had been dragged under the table after he was shot.
but then I saw this.
that's a handprint.
very good.
Hawkins dragged himself across the floor so he could reach for something on the table.
now, if we look at the void in the blood, we can see the approximate shape of what he was reaching for.
dog tag.
a fake dog tag?
I mean, why would Hawkins' final act be picking up a dog tag that he knew wasn't real?
to send us a message.
I know I'm late.
Rick Blaine sat on my alarm clock, turned it off.
what did I miss?
looking for the source of the fake dog tag.
so, whoever gave Hawkins the tag might have something to do with his murder.
that makes sense. - All right, I sent both of you a compiled list from Hawkins' records.
he contacted five PIs to help him search for Kent's remains, four of whom he paid.
so, the rest are what, charities?
Yep, and a handful of for-profits.
fake tag could've come from any of them.
let's split up the list, start digging.
all right, I'll take the PIs.
okay, you take the PIs.
magnum and I thank you.
Bishop, you want the charities?
it's the earbuds.
what?
you don't have the earbuds in?
you're ignoring us?
No,No...
I'm not ignoring you,
I'm... silently agonizing.
why didn't you tell me a good score wasn't good?
probie eval.
Oh, right.
really wasn't our place to tell you.
only a fool would knowingly interfere with Gibbs' methods.
our job, Ellie B. is to follow his lead.
your turn to lead-- what do you got?
running with the fake dog tag, boss.
you look like you're in agony, Bishop.
what? No, all's well.
good, I want you to look into Sergeant Kent's remains.
you mean what Hawkins knew?
Hawkins, JPAC, reports.
anything that can tell us where to look.
but this is about Hawkins' murder.
the location of Sergeant Kent's remains is irrelevant to the case.
missing Marine's always relevant.
our search for Sergeant Kent's remains has been harrowing to say the least.
you conducted a dig two years ago, Colonel?
affirmative.
large grid encompassing the area where Sergeant Kent's body was last seen.
and that turned up nothing.
no, actually, it turned up plenty.
I sent you a series of photos.
you said you wanted everything we have, correct?
that's right.
well, let's start...
with Group One, Item A.
standard-issue canteen.
ID'd as belonging to Marine Private Raymond Smith.
item B, unidentified necklace.
no known connection to the mission.
item C, plastic water bottle.
no known connection to the mission.
excuse me, Colonel.
I-I was hoping to focus on items linked to Sergeant Kent.
none of the items we recovered were linked to Kent.
but Hawkins said he saw Kent's body, held it even.
the recovery chopper was there the next day.
how could every trace of him just disappear?
Vietcong was well aware of "No Marine left behind."
we've encountered several cases of the VC moving bodies to use as bait.
could be what happened here.
so, Sergeant Kent's remains could've ended up anywhere.
that's the frustrating part.
but we don't give up until they come home, Agent Bishop.
down here, Gibbs.
what are you doing?
I'm reversing a terrible mistake.
Hawkins made me realize that saving something that you might have thrown away could be useful.
it's my favorite pen.
it ran out of ink this morning, but that doesn't mean that it can't come in handy someday.
what did Hawkins save?
Oh, well, basically everything, but this is what came in handy.
it was empty?
not entirely.
there's tiny particles of rust inside that match our dog tag.
tag was in the envelope.
and the next question is where did the envelope come from?
it wasn't mailed.
george Hawkins' name is the only thing written on the envelope.
the "H" is very distinctive, but it's just not enough to go on.
DNA?
no, this baby was self-sealed.
now, the edge of the envelope was ripped when Hawkins opened it,
but there was something left behind.
logo.
a fourth of a logo.
but never fear,
I searched, and I recovered the other three quarters.
it's a travel agency.
blue Summit Travel.
I already sent you the address.
to DiNozzo and McGee. The envelope, too.
wait, Gibbs, I have an itch, right here in the middle of my back, that I haven't been able to reach. I need you...
see?!
sure it's one of ours?
can't really make out the logo.
Yeah, we're sure.
never heard of him.
who else uses these envelopes?
uh, look, I got three employees, but they're all at lunch.
somebody's birthday or something.
and they all have access to office supplies?
what is this about?
who's Henry?
what?
messages here, all taken by Henry.
same distinctive "H" as the one in "Hawkins."
guy's name is Henry Caldwell.
What'd he get himself into this time?
he get into something before?
well, I fired him last week.
caught him stealing from petty cash.
got a home address?
Yeah, uh... give me a second.
Hey, listen.
I got a question-- you got a cat?
no.
you ever traveled with one?
well, I don't...
I don't have a cat.
so...
should think about getting one.
Why?
Hey. - They...
all right, let's go.
Abby already got the home address?
Yep, she also said that Caldwell's been arrested twice for fraud, has type 1 diabetes, and plays the banjo.
she got all that, that fast?
like you said, she's the master.
which one is it?
apartment above the pizza place.
huh.
that's Caldwell's plate.
must be home.
thought Tony and McGee were meeting us.
well, they're coming from the other side of town.
Hey.
what are you doing to my car?
NCIS.
we need to talk.
cover the back.
Hey, where?
Freeze!
I told you to cover the back.
I heard a crash.
distraction.
Thanks.
no one's had eyes on Caldwell since he got away.
what do we know?
no sign of the murder weapon at Caldwell's apartment or in his car.
but we did find his laptop, it's giving me a pretty good handle on the scam he was running here.
let's have it.
he got a hold of a list from a charity called Lost Heroes Alliance.
I've heard of them.
they collect info on P. O.W. and M. I.A. cases.
list consisted of people who contacted Lost Heroes Alliance for help with a missing person.
Caldwell turned that into his target list.
Yep, he made initial contact, saying he'd found a dog tag belonging to their loved one.
fake dog tag.
then he would ask for the money to continue his search.
he's got it all broken down in a spreadsheet here.
there was no record on Hawkins' end.
well, that's because Caldwell contacted his targets via phone.
where is Caldwell?
the BOLO...
I'm not asking about the BOLO, McGee.
I'm asking where he is.
uh, I've got something.
so, we know Caldwell had type 1 diabetes.
he can't go without insulin.
he called in a prescription two days ago, hasn't picked it up yet.
he has to go to the pharmacy.
if not, coma city.
you two, go.
sending you the address.
Gibbs, about Caldwell,
I know I shouldn't have gone in, and I know it's my fault he got away...
it's fine.
where are you with Sergeant Kent's remains?
I spoke to JPAC in Vietnam, but I haven't found anything new.
keep looking.
there is your granddad.
it's one of the first pictures I took over there.
now, this one.
we were sweeping through a vil.
and we saw this boy, couldn't have been more than 15, eyes as red as tomatoes.
Vietcong had come through the night before and killed his parents.
slit their throats.
your granddad gave us an order.
said we would halt and help this boy bury his parents.
I-I took this of your granddad and the boy after we were done.
I'll never forget that.
Eleanor, you're still here.
Yeah, uh, thanks again for letting me work in here.
the quiet helps.
it's amazing how a single image can...
take you back in time in an instant.
you were in Vietnam?
I didn't think the Royal Army Medical Corps was there.
it was an exchange posting with the U. S. military.
what comes to mind is the smell of the heat.
when our field hospital came under fire, we took the patients off their bunks and covered them with their mattresses.
if only saving them were that simple.
I think I hear my pillow calling.
unless, of course, you'd like to talk about the real reason you're down here.
a suspect got away because of me.
I completely screwed up, Ducky.
and I went to Gibbs to explain, but he said it was fine, which I know it's not.
the end.
when the world overwhelms,
I find the best thing to do is to start by accomplishing just one little thing.
I don't even think I can do that anymore.
well, if you believe that, why are you sitting on a frigid floor in the middle of the night?
just did two walks around the block.
no sign of Caldwell.
what, you couldn't have got me the apple one?
eat your breakfast, McGee.
what's wrong with you?
I just pulled an all-nighter in a 24-hour pharmacy.
what more do you want from me?
well, you were fine two minutes ago.
drop it.
Tony, what...
Rick Blaine's gone, okay?
what?
just got a call from the cleaning lady.
she was taking out the trash, and he, he just went... right out the door.
he escaped.
he ran down all those stairs?
no, he took the elevator.
huh.
why, I ask myself, why would he want to go?
we were connected, he...
he was like the feline version of me, you know?
maybe he just needed to be free.
Yeah.
Yeah, I get that.
maybe he was in heat?
can male cats be in heat?
caldwell, freeze.
NCIS, hands in the air.
I need my meds.
insulin kicking in?
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.
Hey, listen, l-let me save you some time.
I ran from you, and I'm sorry.
yesterday was a horrible day for me,
I'm sure it was a bad day for you.
and I was a huge part of that.
apologies to you, sincerely.
you sorry about Hawkins, too?
the Vietnam guy, the vet?
Yeah. I really am.
tell me about it.
well, if you know the vet, you know the con, right?
I brought him a dog tag.
he said it was the wrong blood type, and he said he was gonna go to the cops.
so, you, you killed him before he could.
what?
Ah, come on.
come on, don't go getting all shy on me now.
no, no, seriously.
the vet is dead?
Aw, man. Aw, man.
listen, sir, I've been straight with you since you walked through that door.
straight as a con.
I don't run this thing by myself, okay?
I'm a people person, okay?
I work with clients.
my partner, he gets the tags, works behind the scenes.
Oh. So, let me guess.
your partner killed Hawkins.
I don't know. I don't know what he did.
I told him the vet was gonna talk, and I'm done.
I was trying to get some money together to leave town, and
t didn't want to run.
said he was gonna go over there, scare the guy into keeping him quiet.
partner called "T."
it's really convenient.
could be anyone.
he calls himself "T" to protect himself.
I don't know anything else about him.
why would I chase down a letter?
everything I got points to you.
all right, his name's Todd Price.
I worked out of his shop.
place called Blue Summit Travel.
Hey, Price wasn't at the travel agency.
wasn't at home, either.
roommate told us that Price owns a revolver.
smith & Wesson 0.38 Special.
we trust the roommate? - Don't have to.
we searched the place, found the revolver in a crawl space.
Abby's running ballistics.
come on, McGee. Where is he?
phone's still off.
Ah, damn.
what?
flight manifest.
right after we paid him a visit, he hopped a flight to Da Nang.
bought his ticket at the airport in cash.
landed two hours ago.
gear up for Vietnam?
give me something solid first.
well, I've got bank records.
Ah. So, whenever Caldwell deposits a check from a target, there's a corresponding transaction in Price's account.
Caldwell was giving him half.
he was being straight with you.
price was his partner. Proves motive.
Abby says we got ourselves a murder weapon.
Price's fingerprints are all over it.
DiNozzo. Nam go-bag, check.
McGee, get us a flight.
Gibbs, I have a lead on Sergeant Kent's remains.
good. Give it to JPAC.
this is Kent. Look at the necklace on the boy next to him. The medallion has three flowers on it. This...
is the same necklace.
JPAC found it in the ambush site.
I think the boy might have moved Kent's body.
we have to find him.
if you're going to Vietnam, I'm coming.
Bishop, get your lead to JPAC, let them do their job. McGee?
uh, Dulles. Flight leaves in 45.
an My village... that's where the photo was taken.
I spent all night researching it.
just give me the chance, let me prove myself.
that why you went in after Caldwell?
prove yourself?
what else am I supposed to do when you don't believe in me?
Yeah, I know what an 82 on the eval means.
Oh. Yeah, I got to get a thing for my thing.
I'm gonna help him with that thing.
I'm doing things different now.
high score means you did good, that's it.
you pushed all the other probies.
enough. - Why would you change things for me?
Why? - Bishop.
why are you treating me different?
you know what I want to say to you for letting Caldwell get away?
something other than "It's fine.
you're damn right! - Then say it!
you're going easy on me.
for Caldwell, for the eval.
you've been going easy on me since day one, haven't you?
agent Gibbs.
agent DiNozzo.
welcome to Da Nang.
thanks for meeting us, Colonel.
was just a quick chopper over from An My.
we haven't turned up anything yet, but my team is hopeful about Agent Bishop's lead.
here's a few of Hawkins' original photos.
Bishop thought they might be clearer than the scans.
I was looking forward to thanking her for her work.
Yeah, yeah, she couldn't make the trip.
well, pass along my gratitude?
Yep. - Over here.
so, the man you're looking for, you said he's pushing fake dog tags?
Yeah. Todd Price.
you know him? - No.
just this market?
they're everywhere.
tourists feel compelled to buy them, return them to the next of kin. Most times, the tags belong to a vet who survived the war, just got lost somewhere along the way.
or they're fake.
Yes.
cam on.
when Saigon fell at the end of the war, the U. S. pulled out fast.
left a lot behind, including graphotype machines.
people get their hands on them, use them to make fakes.
price has specific targets.
he's got to be making his own tags.
can we trace the machines?
Ah, they've had almost 40 years to change hands.
could be anywhere by now.
this way.
jump! Jump! Jump!
jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
okay, okay, that's it, I'm done.
no, McGee, we have to get your adrenaline up. I need you.
Abbs, I have pulled two all-nighters in a row.
I have nothing left to give.
I have two things left to give, and they're both Caf-POWs!
Pow! POW! - Jimmy, you are a lifesaver.
you, drink.
can I get you guys anything else?
Yes. A fresh set of ears.
okay, I can... see what I can find down in Autopsy.
no, Jimmy, Jimmy. Jimmy.
I meant living... ears.
like, listen to what we have and... give us the take of a non-exhausted, logical person.
that's way easier.
that I can do.
okay...
so, travel records show that Price went to Vietnam often, but there's no trace of where he stays.
I questioned Caldwell again, he said that Price bought a graphotype machine in Da Nang.
he goes there to make the tags.
Whew!
Wow. - Wow what?
I think that Caf-POW! is starting to hit me.
I'm getting a lot of swirling ideas in my head.
okay, harness it, harness it... use it, use it, McGee, don't fight this.
question: why wouldn't Price just ship the machine back here?
good, Jimmy. It's far more convenient to swindle people from home.
unless he had to go back to Vietnam anyways.
he had other business in Da Nang.
this is so great. This...
what are we looking for?
if Price has a business we don't know about, he's got to be hiding it.
hidden account through Blue Summit Travel.
travel.
are you seeing this? - Yep.
hundreds of e-mails between Price and a woman named Phan Thi Kim.
they're love letters.
his other business in Da Nang is his girlfriend.
Yep.
tracking the IP address to find a location.
da Nang!
got it!
NCIS! - Hands on your head, Price.
uh, okay, okay, okay.
your girlfriend here?
no, no, she went out.
get on your feet.
look, I don't know what it is you think I did...
place is clear.
Oh, look at that.
a dog tag-making machine.
did you tell him we have the murder weapon, too?
it was self-defense.
I went there, just to scare him.
he came at me-- I'm telling you, - it was self-defense. - You used people's hope.
wait, no, no, listen, listen, I...
you murdered a United States Marine.
there is no defense for that.
get him dressed and back to DC.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
where, Leland?
his name is Ky Van Tu.
he left his necklace at the ambush site, because the lotus flower is a sacred symbol.
he wanted to bless the place where Kent died.
why did he move the body?
he'll tell you himself.
he asked to speak to someone who would see the family in person.
I will try in English.
chao.
chao.
this is, uh, me.
this man...
he help me bury my mother...
my father.
I want to thank him, but I do not know how.
so I follow.
I follow far behind.
soon I hear gun, and I hide.
after...
I see my friend dead.
you saw his body?
Yes.
I, uh...
I run home for my cart, and I bring my friend here.
Why?
I bury him next to my parents.
I do not know that... his family look for him.
this is how I honor him.
this is how I thank him.
when I got home, people were angry about the war.
little girl, about your age...
she saw my uniform, threw a rock at me.
big, tough Marine, and there I was, getting my heart broken by a little girl.
I was...
ashamed to wear the uniform that I had been so proud of before.
but then...
I thought about Kent.
your granddad, he would have told me to wear my blues proud...
and to keep fighting for what was right...
no matter what people say.
that's...
what I tried to do, Greta...
keep fighting for what matters.
bringing your granddad home, it matters.
thank you.
he was the best friend I ever had.
he mattered.
we all matter.
just left a few minutes ago.
you?
just finishing up my stuff for a JPAC's report.
sergeant Kent's family is grateful.
you did good work.
Thanks.
you were right.
I was?
I have been going easy on you.
but it's got nothing to do with you.
well, I don't understand.
it's about that desk.
lost two people off that desk.
good people.
that's on me.
I was doing something wrong.
when something's wrong...
you change it.
this job is hard.
I know that.
no, it's hard, Gibbs.
it's inevitable you'd lose people along the way.
it doesn't mean your way of teaching is wrong.
look at Tony and McGee-- they're amazing.
Yeah.
I want to be like them.
I want to be like you, Gibbs.
I'm asking you to push me to be like you.
okay.
okay?
Yeah. Okay.
back to the old way.
thank you.
this floor...
is for standing and walking.
what?
sit in your damn chair, Bishop.
marine, put the camera down.
this is the photo taken last September by Marine photojournalist Staff Sergeant Martin Roe.
he's known as Shooter. He was assigned to a joint Army/Marine task force in Farah Province.
I saw the photo in the Post.
how did it get out?
roe gave it to the task force commander.
who gave it to the press, well, that's a matter of conjecture, and it will be an issue in the court-martial.
a lot of Army people have accused Roe of being the leak.
come in.
Hey, Chad.
you ready to sell me that old pickup of yours?
not a chance. What's up? - Need your help.
the man in this picture, Army First Lieutenant Michael Waters, is being court-martialed for the death of the Afghan villager.
it's hard not to have heard about it in Washington.
the lieutenant claims that the villager was a Taliban terrorist and it was a justified shooting.
sergeant Roe, who took the picture and is presently under my command, claims it was a revenge execution.
he said, he said.
court-martial started last week.
staff Sergeant Roe was due to testify on Friday, but he didn't show. They can't find him.
so they recessed until tomorrow.
when's the last time you saw him?
four days ago.
he's the key witness, and he was looking forward to testifying.
they don't have much of a case without him.
okay. Let's get on it.
gentlemen, I've already heard from SECNAV and the commandant of the Marine Corps.
army's pissed that a photo taken by a Marine was leaked to the press.
it's making them look bad.
tread lightly.
you're late.
I had something to do.
boss isn't in yet?
uh, he beat us all in. He's with the director.
is our little Timmy trying to grow a beard? Mmm.
going for the bad-boy look? - Cut it out, Tony.
I think beards are sexy.
can an NCIS agent grow one?
not you. - I'm not growing a beard.
my face started itching on Friday, and I went to see a dermatologist on the way home.
it got worse over the weekend, and I went back to the doctor's this morning.
she told me I have pseudofolliculitis.
isn't that a Mary Poppins song? - It's not a big deal, apparently.
she gave me something for the itch and told me not to shave for a week.
you get a note from the doctor for Gibbs?
Ooh, hmm. Here he comes.
who's he with? - Ah, it's Commander Hendricks.
public affairs officer on the Navy Yard.
McGee, put up the service records of Staff Sergeant Martin Roe - Hey, Commander. - DiNozzo.
that's the Marine photographer - that took the picture. - He's missing.
he was due at the Army court-martial Friday.
called him all weekend. Left messages. Got no response.
even checked out his apartment. - Do you have his cell phone number?
I could do a quick location trace. - Yeah.
talk to the family? -Yes. His parents in Flagstaff.
they haven't heard from him in weeks.
anything you can tell us, like friends or enemies?
Roe's only been back from Afghanistan since the first of the year.
I don't know that much about him.
except that he really gets into his assignments.
what's he working on now?
a piece on homeless military veterans in the DC area.
well, Roe's phone is either turned off - or his battery's dead. - DiNozzo, Bishop, get a warrant.
check out Sergeant Roe's residence.
I want to talk to the person who benefits most from Staff Sergeant Roe's disappearance,
army Lieutenant Waters.
keep me in the loop.
appreciate you coming in, Lieutenant Waters.
Yeah, not a problem. I have nowhere else to be today.
maybe you didn't hear-- my court-martial was put on hold.
uh, Special Agent Gibbs,
I'm Major Huggins, Lieutenant Waters' JAG counsel.
I thought I should accompany him.
we're just not sure why NCIS wants to talk with my client.
staff Sergeant Roe is missing, and we're trying to find him.
we're talking to his coworkers, people who know him.
obviously, I have to interview the person who stands to gain the most from his absence.
what are you saying?
staff Sergeant Roe not testifying has a big impact on your trial.
are you accusing me of having something to do with that lying dirtbag not showing up?
I'm not accusing you of anything.
it says "interrogation" on the outside of that door,
special Agent Gibbs.
that's a little intimidating.
and, obviously, this is sounding like something more than just an interview.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've been restricted to post at Fort McNair since I was brought back from Afghanistan.
check the logs.
we will.
I think we are done here.
you know, I got a theory - why that bastard didn't show up. - Michael.
he went into hiding so he wouldn't have to tell his lies in court and perjure himself.
what?
roe shot a photograph.
you shot a villager.
hopefully a jury will decide - if it was justified. - Hopefully.
I know what this is all about.
look at his haircut.
you a Marine, Gibbs?
this is one dumb jarhead covering for another.
sergeant Roe is a really good photographer.
I just can't get used to this.
it creeps me out. - What?
just... going through people's stuff without their permission.
it's an invasion of privacy.
it's my favorite part of the job. I love it.
you find out people's secrets.
and I have discovered that the smallest things can tell you a whole lot.
like what? - Who they really are.
on the surface, our staff sergeant's a 28-year-old Marine combat photographer who goes into battle armed with just a camera.
but, below the surface...
he's a sentimental romantic.
how do you know that?
last month's cable bill. Look at those pay-per-view choices.
the Vow?
the Notebook?
Sabrina? Both versions?
I mean, I understand the Bogey one, but the Harrison Ford one? Terrible.
all right.
I'll go through the recent pictures on his camera.
no.
we'll do that when we get back to the office.
I want you to go into the bathroom.
that's where the darkest secrets lurk.
it's kind of nice getting out of the office and into the field, - isn't it? - Yeah.
wait till you do your first 24-hour, all-night surveillance.
McGee already warned me.
I think I found something.
roe had at least one enemy.
we know where you live.
wise up and shut up.
no signature.
maybe Abby can pull prints.
Bishop, can you hear me?
I found something, too.
was Roe an addict?
those the recent pictures from Roe's camera?
Yeah.
there are some really poignant shots of homeless people.
one guy with a dog is in a lot of them.
what's taking so long with the timeline?
all those pictures were time- and date-stamped.
Yeah, they also have a GPS location. I'm laying out pictures on a map to show where they were taken.
I am almost... done.
the final picture was taken last Wednesday.
looks like most of 'em were in a two-block area.
Yeah, near here.
just outside the Navy Yard.
let's go for a walk.
maybe we can find someone who's seen Sergeant Roe.
said you had something, Abbs.
afternoon, Ms. Sciuto.
Hey, Commander. - Find a fingerprint on that note?
actually, I found two. They're thumbprints.
they both belong to Sergeant Roe, but that's not what I wanted to show you.
I found traces of fentanyl and heroin on the spoon.
it's a cocktail commonly called China White on the street.
I found the same drug in the reservoir of the syringe.
and I found Sergeant Roe's DNA on the needle.
I don't believe it.
no way that kid was on drugs.
maybe you didn't know him that well.
any luck?
no.
me, neither.
it's hard to believe we work only a few blocks from here.
well, hold on.
this picture was taken right here.
several of 'em were taken over there.
and according to the GPS, this picture was taken from inside this building.
all right, well, let's see if we can find a way in.
toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.
Oh. What's that stench?
Ugh!
what a sad existence.
Tony, there's a lot of people living in here.
they're dying here, too.
this building's been a nightmare.
I've had a problem with drug addicts and the homeless.
I board it up, they break in.
it's a losing battle.
when's the last time you were inside?
I don't know. Couple weeks ago.
and now there's a dead body?
never be able to sell this place.
well, this is definitely Staff Sergeant Roe.
when, Duck? - Educated guess, four or five days.
preliminary cause an overdose?
Yeah, well, this dried foam around his mouth is consistent with that conclusion.
Oh, we'll know more when we do a full tox screen.
I don't think he's been using long.
no previous needle marks or infections.
something wrong, boss?
it's just not where I thought this one was going.
got a call in the car.
with the key witness dead, it looks like the charges are going to be dropped.
court-martial proceedings against Lieutenant Waters will be dismissed.
how convenient. - Staff Sergeant Roe's - family been notified? - Yeah.
CACO team's on it.
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
can I help you, Director?
on my way down, Duck.
Hey, Ducky and Abby have something.
want to come along?
sure.
looking a little scruffy, McGee.
that was quick.
always good to see you, Director.
what did you two find out?
cause of death, as suspected, was a drug overdose.
it's a combination of heroin and fentanyl, same proportions as found on the needle in his apartment.
however, that's not why we called you down here.
after the autopsy was finished, but before I put the body away,
I noticed a slight abrasion on the sergeant's nose.
like one would get from vigorously rubbing with a handkerchief.
let me show you.
just tell us what you know, Duck.
I-I swabbed the anterior nasal passage and sent the sample up to Abby.
I found residue of high concentrations of chloroform.
our conclusion is that the sergeant was incapacitated by the chloroform before a lethal injection of heroin was administered to his unconscious body.
ergo...
sergeant Roe was murdered.
staff Sergeant Roe is no longer a missing person, because he's dead.
it's a murder. - Well, Waters, the Army lieutenant, has got to be at the top of the suspect list.
he was gunning for Roe. - But he was confined to the base.
Yeah, but his assault team vehemently backs his story and blames Roe for his court-martial.
well, check it out, McGee.
photos we found on Roe's camera show he was digging deep into the street subculture.
we found his body in a building where the homeless squat.
put up those pictures.
they're interesting.
maybe Roe stuck his nose or his camera in the wrong place.
the guy with the dog's in a lot of them.
Yeah, we noticed that.
Bishop, blow up that one.
move in on the tattoo.
the guy was Navy. - Roe's C. O. said that he was working on a story about homeless veterans.
roe spent a lot of time with this guy. Find out who he is.
I know who he is.
that's Dave and Blue.
Dave who?
just Dave. He doesn't have a last name.
got to have a last name.
he's a dog. Dogs don't have last names.
the guy's name is Blue? - Yeah. That's what they call him.
I see him and Dave by the off-ramp almost every single morning. I gave Blue that shirt last Christmas.
and I bring Dave dog food a couple times a week.
run facial recognition of Navy veterans.
you know, I actually haven't seen Blue in the last few days.
did he do something? Is he in trouble?
I don't know.
come on.
Hi. Excuse me.
NCIS. Have you...?
tell me you got something. - No.
I mean, I can understand if people don't recognize the picture of Sergeant Roe.
but Abby said she's seen Blue and his dog around here for years.
somebody must have seen them.
trust me, they have, but they're not gonna tell us.
we're the enemy.
we're flashing badges, we got a gun, we're asking questions.
we're what they fear.
authority. - So what do we do?
blend in. Go undercover? - Oh.
it won't work. We've been all over the neighborhood.
I'm very good at disguises.
no, we won't pull it off.
you know, you're right, probie.
but I think I know one Agent who might be able to.
he's been looking a little... scruffy lately.
major.
I have got a problem, Director Vance.
what's the problem?
I received a call from your Agent Gibbs.
he wants me to bring Lieutenant Waters back in.
there's no point. He's already been interviewed.
yesterday, we were investigating a missing Marine.
today, we're investigating his murder.
and I thought we made it clear to Agent Gibbs.
waters couldn't be involved.
he's been restricted to post at Fort McNair.
we found a threatening letter in Staff Sergeant Roe's apartment.
it could have come from Waters, or a member of his team.
they've been very loyal to him.
for good reason. The man is a hero.
three tours of duty in a war zone.
multiple decorations, including two Purple Hearts.
he was in that Afghan village to flush out a sniper who killed one of his men the day before.
he shot that villager in self-defense.
that may be.
it's for your Army court-martial to decide.
my agency's concern is with the murder of a U. S. Marine in Washington, DC.
the court-martial is not going to happen.
and I want NCIS to stop harassing my client.
you know what I think?
this whole thing is just some inter-service rivalry.
you're wrong there, Major.
NCIS is a civilian agency.
we don't report to anyone in uniform.
we will follow every possible lead...
wherever it may take us.
get Waters over here, or we'll drag him in in handcuffs.
Hey, Abby. - Hey.
still working on the facial recognition?
Yeah. The beard's making it kind of difficult.
Hey, uh, where is McGee?
I've taken over his investigation on Lieutenant Waters' unit, but can't read his handwriting.
he's, um... he's in there with Tony and Christopher from tech services, but proceed with caution.
he's not a happy camper.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's real good, Christopher.
it's gonna cover the earpiece. Perfect.
we just need a little more grime under the nails.
Tony, stay out of it. - Yeah.
I can do more.
what do you think, Bishop?
Mmm... wow. You look...
homeless.
so, uh, I'm going over your notes, and at the end of your interview with the medic on Lieutenant Waters' team...
uh, can't make this out. It looks like "WPF"?
Yeah. That's my shorthand.
WPF-- "when pigs fly
I didn't believe a word the guy said.
Ah. Thanks.
all right, I think we got the visual perfect here.
but we're missing something.
what are we missing?
odor.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted to go that far.
uh, I don't.
I've got something.
Oh, wow. That's nice.
Oh, God. Oh. Oh.
Aah! God, what is that?
Oh!
certified, purified, organic cat urine and body odor.
Oh. - Ew!
I'm out of here.
Oh, my God! You guys.
you're destroying my lab.
okay, I've got facial recognition back.
blue's real name is Everett Turpin.
it's so weird. I've never thought of him as an Everett.
but he was a petty officer first class, and he was honorably discharged in June 2003.
Oh! Clean up this stuff!
you're going to pay for this, Tony.
you're still here.
Oh, yeah.
how's it going?
uh, could use some help.
yeah? What's the problem?
the civilian lawyer representing the members of Lieutenant Waters' team isn't cooperating.
won't give us handwriting samples to compare to the threatening note found in Sergeant Roe's apartment.
I'll make a call.
you check the logs on Lieutenant Waters?
McGee did.
the only times he left Fort McNair were for court-martial appearances and his interview with you on Monday.
and he was accompanied at all times by his JAG lawyer, Major Huggins.
fort McNair is only minutes from the abandoned building where Sergeant Roe's body was found.
could he have slipped off base?
waters wearing an electronic monitor?
Nope. He just has to check in every two hours.
you heard from McGee or DiNozzo?
uh, not a word, and they've been gone for hours.
you better pick out a spot, McGrubby.
all the good ones are getting taken.
I'm not spending the night out here, Tony.
I'm cold and I'm starving.
I'd say stop by the car-- there's a slice of pizza left, but...
we can't blow your cover, man.
I've been out here for hours and I've gotten nowhere.
no one's seen him for days.
they think he moved on.
don't give up.
boy, it's pretty toasty in this car.
you know, this isn't working.
I want to go home.
you're not leaving.
if you don't drive me, I'll take a cab.
good luck finding one in this neighborhood, especially looking and smelling like you do.
you know what?
I'm walking to the car, - right now. - I'll leave.
no, you won't. - Hey, I got an idea.
why don't you go back to the mission?
they got a bed there. And a hot meal.
maybe you can make some friends.
maybe somebody knew something.
on your six. - Hey, you, stop.
you the guy asking about Blue?
uh, yeah.
what's he to you?
he helped me out.
I owe him.
have you seen him?
a few days ago.
wasn't looking good.
you see that nosy photographer that was following him around?
Yeah.
I heard he took him to get help.
Where'd they go?
doesn't matter.
rumor is Blue died.
thank you very much.
Everett Turpin, aka Blue, died last Wednesday night at the First Street Urgent Care Clinic.
what's the cause of death? - Catastrophic heart failure.
last Wednesday. That's one day before Ducky estimated
sergeant Roe was murdered by an overdose.
the building where we found his body isn't that far from the clinic.
so a Marine photojournalist is doing a story on a homeless vet.
24 hours later, they're both dead. - What's the connection?
boss, I don't think that we should rule out Lieutenant Waters and his team.
sergeant Roe was gonna be the key witness against him. Roe received a threatening letter from somebody.
Waters' team is in Washington as potential witnesses.
I say we put a little pressure on them.
well, yeah. Go for it, McGee.
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
did you find Blue?
Hey, Abbs.
Hey. I'm sorry.
he's dead.
what happened?
he had a heart attack.
Oh.
Oh, he was such a...
such a sweet man.
he had such kind eyes.
I thought maybe he had some problems.
and Dave was such a good companion.
he kept him all calm and together.
I wish I could have done more to help him.
Abby, you can't solve everyone's problems.
some people have demons they have to overcome.
Yeah.
wait, what about Dave?
the dog? - Where is he?
we didn't see him.
I couldn't imagine living on the streets.
lot of reasons that happens, Bishop.
at least there's a place like this.
sorry to keep you waiting, Agent Gibbs.
I'm Lorin Davis. I'm the clinic director.
I was dealing with a woman in there with a very sick infant.
Yeah.
no problem. This is Special Agent Bishop.
please, have a seat.
you were asking about Everett Turpin.
I believe he was known in the neighborhood as Blue.
we were told he died of heart failure. - Yes.
it was very sad. He wasn't that old. But, you know, life on the streets can be very tough.
when did he come in? - Um... last Wednesday.
he was complaining of shortness of breath and chest pains.
how long after Blue came in did he die?
you know, it was all very sudden.
uh, his vitals were taken.
blood pressure was low.
the attending physician ordered an EKG, one of the nurses was about to administer it
that's when he went into full cardiac arrest.
the doctor immediately tried to resuscitate him with a defibrillator, and that's when I a called 911.
where were you gonna send him?
uh, the E. R. at Washington General.
we're not equipped to handle something like that.
we're just a clinic.
did the paramedics get here?
Yes, within ten minutes. But it was too late.
who called time of death? - Dr. Novak.
he here now? - No. No, Dr. Novak has a private practice in Reston.
he donates one day of his week to help here.
Novak sign the death certificate? - Yes.
did, uh... Did this man bring Blue in?
you know, he wasn't wearing a uniform...
but yeah, I think that's the guy.
in fact, I remember talking to him in the waiting room.
he was very concerned about his friend.
and after Blue passed, he spent a private moment with the body.
can we get a copy of Turpin's death certificate and medical file?
Oh, uh, certainly.
thank you.
is it always this busy here?
well, more so this year.
it was a long, cold winter.
had to be tough living on the streets.
Dave, stop it.
what's the matter?
Dave. Hi.
Hi. Hi.
Hi. I've been looking all over for you.
I was so worried. Hi. Hi.
Hey, I'm Abby.
how do you know Dave?
um, well, I used to see him all the time with Blue.
over by the off-ramp.
I feed him. And he loves these biscuits.
Hi.
Where'd you find him?
what, you think I stole him?
blue asked me to watch him.
blue passed away.
blue never leaves Dave for more than a day.
I figured it was bad.
what's your name?
how long have you known Blue? - I don't know.
he looked out for me.
like a big brother.
I could totally see that.
so where's your family? - Dead.
where do you live? I mean, do you have a place to sleep?
lady, you ask too many questions.
come on, Dave.
in here.
sorry I'm late.
former Petty Officer Turpin's medical records arrived from the Veterans Administration just as I was leaving.
want something to drink?
no, not yet, thanks.
records indicate any history of heart disease?
no.
but Turpin hadn't been seen by a VA doctor in years.
any hint at why he was homeless?
well, he was treated for alcoholism two years after his discharge.
one could assume it was an ongoing problem.
the VA's got a lot of programs for vets, Duck.
wonder why Turpin was living on the streets.
I recently read a HUD report.
it estimates, on any given night, between 50, 000 and 60, 000 men and women who have served are sleeping on the streets or in shelters.
what happens to the body of a homeless vet when they die?
it's transferred to the morgue.
it's held there for 30 days while they search for next of kin.
if none are found, then the remains are cremated.
the ashes are then sent back to the VA for burial.
do they perform an autopsy?
none is required if the patient is under a doctor's care at the time of death.
autopsies are rarely performed on the homeless.
just out of curiosity:
why are you asking this?
someone wanted NCIS to believe that Staff Sergeant Roe had committed suicide. He didn't; he was murdered.
roe was doing a story on a homeless vet who supposedly died of a heart attack.
I think maybe he didn't.
interesting.
get hold of Petty Officer Turpin's body and do what you do.
morning, Abbs.
morning.
who's Emma Carter?
she's a homeless girl.
she's looking after Dave, the dog. I pulled her prints - off that mirror over there. - Hmm.
how's she figure into the case? - Well, I don't think she does.
she was just a good friend to Blue.
I mean, obviously, he trusted her with Dave.
Really? I don't remember her - from any of Sergeant Roe's pictures. - Oh, well, there's a reason for that.
she didn't want to be found.
she's a runaway. - Yeah, and didn't want her picture or whereabouts advertised.
from Nebraska, huh? - I looked her up on the Internet.
she's been missing for six years.
her parents worked with the police and the FBI.
had her picture everywhere: T-shirts, posters, milk cartons. They even hired a private investigator.
but they never found her. - So what are you gonna do?
call her parents? The FBI?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
doctor, did Blue die of a heart attack?
as advertised. Myocardial infarction.
his coronary arteries have 95% blockage.
living on the street, poor nutrition, compromised liver. It doesn't help.
I found epinephrine in his system.
that would have been administered by the attending physician in a clinic when they tried to revive him.
also, bruising on the sternum and slight damage to the rib cage, which would be consistent with CPR.
so there was an attempt to save his life.
Yeah. - Wait, wait, wait.
you call all excited.
now you're dancing around something, Duck. What?
what are we looking at, Doctor?
both of Blue's kidneys are missing. Yet there's no mention of it in his medical records or the death certificate.
meaning what? - Someone stole his vital organs.
it's against the law to financially benefit from the donation of a human organ in this country.
but, on the black market, it's big business.
a kidney can sell for as much as $120, 000 here and, in Singapore, twice as much.
Ducky said organs have to be harvested minutes after death.
the attending physician, Dr. Graham Novak, didn't indicate anything in the records about donated organs.
Bishop, what do you have on him?
uh, Dr. Novak has a prominent practice in Reston. He's on the board of directors at Washington General Hospital and several charities.
married, two grown children, model citizen.
not even a parking ticket. - What did I miss?
you're with me. - Where we going?
we are gonna pay the doctor a visit. Come on.
Hi, Dave.
Hi.
I brought you some dog food.
look.
boy, hi, hi.
Where's Emma?
Where's Emma, huh?
how do you know my name?
why'd you tell me you didn't have a family?
I don't.
you do. Your parents are alive, and they live in Nebraska.
who are you?
what do you think you're doing?
I'm just trying to help.
you don't have to live like this.
you don't know anything about me.
I know you ran away from home when you were 16 years old. Why?
because they didn't want me there.
you'd be surprised how many 16-year-olds feel that way.
but you're older now.
and so are they.
maybe time has changed things.
not enough.
what are you doing?
this is from last summer.
I hope this somehow gets to you.
your father and I miss you and love you.
we know we made mistakes, and we're sorry.
our lives stopped when you left.
please, come home.
here.
it's a prepaid phone card.
just think about calling 'em.
there's nothing to say.
Dr. Novak? - Yes.
NCIS. We'd like to have a word with you.
certainly. What's this about?
a couple of missing kidneys.
why would a respected doctor like you get involved in the sale of black-market organs?
it started as a one-time thing.
you thought stealing an organ once was okay?
no.
I was helping an older friend.
a mentor of mine.
he was way down on the organ donor list and wouldn't have lived long enough to receive a kidney through proper channels.
so you stole one for him?
I didn't see it that way.
late one night,
I was volunteering at the clinic.
an indigent died.
he had no family. Nobody.
he was going to be shipped to the morgue where he'd be cremated.
it was meant to be: he was the right blood type, tissue antigens matched.
his kidney saved my friend's life.
that's when you realized you could make it a business?
no.
I never intended to do it again.
but you did.
I was blackmailed into it. - By who?
the director of the clinic.
was he brokering organs? - I never asked,
I never wanted to know.
but you kept doing it.
I started to rationalize.
even if other people were making money, lives were being saved.
every year, thousands of people die on organ transplant waiting lists.
did Staff Sergeant Roe become suspicious?
when he came into the examination room to pay his last respects, he noticed the body was still on a ventilator even after brain activity ceased.
so you were keeping the kidneys viable?
I was concerned, but...
Lorin told me not to worry.
he said he'd take care of the problem.
did you know Sergeant Roe was murdered?
no.
everybody stay seated.
federal agents.
will you excuse me a second?
what's going on? - We have a warrant for the seizure of clinic records.
Lorin Davis, you're under arrest for the murder of Staff Sergeant Martin Roe.
and when we're through with you, the FBI wants to talk about the theft and sale of human organs.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi.
I was hoping you would come back.
Hi.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry. I-I forgot your name.
Yeah, Abby, um, - can I ask you a favor? - Yeah.
will you watch Dave for a while?
sure. Wh-Why?
my parents got me a bus ticket to Nebraska.
you called them.
that is... that's just so great.
Yeah. I hope so.
what changed?
thinking about that video you showed me and what Blue would've said if he saw it.
I never... thought I'd be out here this long.
but I guess, after a while, I believed I got what I deserved.
no.
you're better than that, Emma.
that's what my mom said, too.
there but by the grace of God.
Yeah.
served his country honorably.
how'd he end up like that, Leon?
shame is it happens too often.
I just heard the court-martial for Lieutenant Waters is gonna resume.
they're gonna try the case without the testimony of Staff Sergeant Roe.
it's back in the hands of the legal system.
what happens, happens.
I'm glad I caught you. Petty Officer Turpin's remains are on their way to Arlington.
it is going to be buried with full military honors next to Staff Sergeant Roe in a joint ceremony.
thank you for arranging that, Dr. Mallard.
Oh, it's an honor they both deserve.
Yep.
let's go home.
Hai...
Wah!
[Yelling And Punching]
man: Cut.
OK, that's a print. That was great, Billy.
OK, everybody, get...
Eddie, get up there and see what the hell's happening.
Billy, are you all right?
that thing crashed exactlywhere you were.
I know. I know.
watch it up there!
it was an accident.
man: Ok, that's a wrap.
great fight, Billy. Really nice.
be sure you get tomorrow's call sheets.
and please don't get lost on the way to location.
time is money, gentlemen.
time is money. Time is money.
so, you got in here finally.
we haven't heard from you.
you know, I once knew a super rock group in London.
called themselves the Flight Crew.
had brilliant potential. Brilliant.
Yeah, but they were very stubborn.
their lead guitarist Iost a couple offingers one night.
[Snap Snap]
just like that.
hands and feet have been known to disappear.
Lights--they fall out ofthe sky.
all kinds ofthings happen.
a man has got to have all of his parts to make it.
don't you agree with that, Billy?
get the hell out of here.
Oh, well.
it's, uh, getting a little late.
we'll be sitting right there bythe telephone, just waiting foryou to call.
but patience--that's not one of ourvirtues.
don't be a slow learner, Billy.
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
no, that was a very big mistake.
woman: Will this be the song
I'll be singing tomorrow?
will the piper be paid for the tunes
is this the best rhyme
major, minor, one-in-one time
or will the tune
fall from favor
forever?
a yesternight song
ofpast times
together
will this be the song
I'll be singing
billy: I'm here to take you to dinner.
Hey, Billy, can we get spaghetti tonight?
we got one more number to get today, Ann.
thanks a lot, Charlie.
you're messing around with my love life.
is the boss upstairs?
Yeah.
man: You're looking a little pale.
what you need is a good nourishing meal, something that will stickto your ribs.
ha ha ha.
[Chuckling]
you beautiful bastard.
I'll get you another one.
Dr. Land?
we're all next door.
yes? What?
Steiner is here.
get right to it.
good afternoon, Steiner.
good afternoon, Doctor.
how was your trip to New York?
QITE uneventful.
the heat was terrible. God-awful.
not much better here. Humid.
so much for the weather report.
I'm not the only one who just arrived.
how about yourtrip to Berlin, Stick?
it went pretty much as you figured.
now that, uh, he's the big star,
I couldn't reason with him.
he said he was pulling out.
then he threatened me.
Oh, my, my, my, my.
ha ha.
the rest of it was in the papers.
that's when he committed suicide, huh?
ha ha ha.
he just, uh, got up and jumped out the window.
Oh, my, my.
the merger of S & S Records with Globe has been completed, and construction has started on the new record pressing plant in Buenos Aires.
but more important and more immediate is the oncoming championship fight in Macau.
I know we're getting worldwide press.
Steiner: That and plenty more.
all the posters have been approved and the ad campaign.
the best one we've ever had.
looks good. Looks great.
besides the gate and our TV rights, it's generating the kind of international betting we'd hoped for.
we ought to turn over about $30 million.
that was the computer's readout as oftoday.
Yes, well, the fight is only 3 weeks off.
I assume yourtraining is going well, Carl. You look fit.
I'll be ready.
we've got a little problem in Detroit, a couple of reluctant ball players.
hakim, I think you can fly to Detroit and handle that and be back in time forthe fight?
figure. It's done, man.
also, I'm afraid we're going to have to do something about Billy Lo.
I was wondering about that.
I was going to ask how that was going.
well, he refuses to sign our management contract, but that's not what bothers me now.
he's starting to shoot off. his mouth.
he's holding out.
Dr. Land: We've given him so many chances
an amazing amount of resistance.
and then there's that girlfriend:
Ann Morris.
I went to talk to hertoday.
her last album was on the charts and is doing great in Australia and France.
she says she wants to talk to Billy about her contract before she signs.
doctor, I think we ought to squeeze a little.
Dr. Land: Yeah, let's just squeeze a little, wouldn't you say?
Billy?
Yeah.
I had another visit today from one of those syndicate men.
did he threaten you?
well, not exactly.
I mean, not in so many words, but I knew I was being threatened.
Billy, do you think it's worth holding out?
I mean, I've heard some pretty ugly things about those guys, ugly stories.
if we're stopped, don't do anything that will give them an excuse to hurt you.
Ann, I love you, and I don't want you hurt.
trust me to handle this.
billy: I would like Miss Morris to leave.
I'm afraid we can't do that, Billy.
we're all in this together.
now, would you mind stepping out of the car?
no matter what happens, don't get out of the car.
you've got until tomorrow morning to call us.
it's the last time we're going to ask, Billy.
Billy!
No!
Billy.
Hyah!
please stop it!
please don't!
Billy.
Billy!
he hasn't got too much time.
you tell him that.
we want to hear from him in the morning.
Billy, I've always been straight with you.
you don't have too many choices.
you and Ann are nothing to them.
you're just another piece of property, just one of a couple of thousand of public personalities that they own all of or a piece of.
it seems like a good thing at the moment.
they take care of everything
your booking, your salary, yourtaxes.
if you need 5, 000 in your pocket, you've got it.
it's later that you start to realize what it's costing you.
I don't have to remind you about Charlie Wang.
we know the pressure they put on him, and we know they called him in for a "talk.
Hyah!
the next day, he was fished out of the harbor.
but going along with them isn't much better.
you've come up fast, Billy.
the pictures are grossing big all over the world.
you're an international celebrity, and they smell that money.
Thankyou.
you can sign with them and live very well, or you can defy them and go to the police, which means you won't live so well, if at all.
is it your advice to let them own us?
no. I just don't want to write an obituary on you.
I like you too much, which is my cue to get my ass down to the bureau.
I've got a midnight deadline for the States.
I can't allow it.
it is better to die a broken piece of jade than to live a life of clay.
Qit. You've got enough money.
tell them to go to hell.
Ann: I can leave this all behind.
I don't need this if you don't need it.
there has to be another answer.
I've got to find one.
Ann: The Chinese opera is in town.
maybe see your uncle.
Yeah, he just got back.
I'll go to the theater tomorrow. Good idea.
all three of them are leaving the restaurant.
what should we do?
Dr. Land: Don't lose them.
Steiner: Alegandre, from now on,
I want you to coordinate all your eff. orts with the agency in New York.
and by the way, what are the odds where you are now?
well, then keep the publicity going about Carl's rumored sprained ligament.
don't give the impression that the fight's going to be canceled, just that he's in pain and might be at a disadvantage.
you got that?
Ciao.
the odds are a little too heavy on Carl, especially in London.
Yes, a good idea to even that up a bit.
Oh, by the way, what about Billy Lo?
he was told to call earlier today.
he has the number to call.
Oh, do we know where he is at this moment?
well, we always know where he is.
well, then a final warning,
OK, Carl?
Yes, Pasqual. You go with him.
[Chuckling]
Pasqual loves to fight, yes.
ha ha.
let me use your brush. Thanks.
man: Billy, good to see you.
billy: Hi, John. I'm glad you're back.
your uncle is in his room.
Billy. Come in, Billy.
come in. Hey. Hey!
you go ahead.
it's good to see you, boy. Sit down. Sit down.
[Clears Throat]
we do not see you much since you got to be a big man.
Oh, yes, I know.
I've been running for months.
Yeah, very busy, huh?
I heard that the syndicate is afteryou.
you must be a big man.
how did you know that?
it's a small business.
I can't join them, and I can't be forced to join.
you have just described a problem as old as man.
you're not unique.
there is a solution
I do not think you've considered.
when you get to the top, you understand how far it is to fall, but if you think very little of yourself, then you can be pushed off and fall very easily.
what is your opinion ofyourself?
I believe I deserve to be where I am.
I've worked hard for it.
then don't let them push.
they will never let you rest.
you push.
you mean kill?
integrity can be an expensive thing.
what is the price of your integrity?
what are you willing to pay?
there is another person as well, a girl.
if I fight, she may be hurt.
send her away.
do you need help?
I know some men who can help you.
no.
you're not allowed back here.
get out! Get out!
[Woman Screams]
another message, Billy.
the Chinese syndicate wants to make sure they're riding with a winner, so they're willing to buy a little insurance.
a million and a half dollars in cash will be arriving in Macau just before the fight.
they're going to drop it right on your doorstep.
clean money?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, very crisp and very clean.
the cash started out in Nassau.
it's going through Tommy's bank in Mexico City right now.
we're watching its progress.
fine. Fine.
Oh, Carl.
Yes, sir.
what about Billy Lo?
what's happened there?
nothing. Not a word.
he's not going to call.
rebellion is contagious, Doctor.
let's close the book.
[Chuckles Softly]
what an unfortunate waste, casting aside his life like that.
what a pity.
[Telephone Rings]
hello.
billy: Hello, Ann. It's me.
Billy, where have you been?
I've been trying to reach you all day.
I've been worried about you.
I've been worried about you, too, darling.
Ann, listen carefully.
I want you to meet me on the 6: 00 ferry.
you'll find me in the passenger section.
do you understand?
OK. Billy, are you all right?
Yes. To tell the truth,
I feel much better now.
Billy.
Billy, you've been hurt.
it doesn't matter.
Ann, I want you to go back to the States for a while.
leave you here?
I have to work this problem out by myself.
it would only be for a while, a couple of months.
no way, Billy.
I can't do that.
look, you can't help me, but ifyou stay, I can hurt you.
maybe you should change your name and disappearfor a while.
I have only one scene left in this film.
I'll be dropping out of sight myself.
Billy, I can't leave you.
what are you up to?
not a thing.
we have to separate.
Ann, I'd like to live with you a long time, you know?
grow old together.
Ann, On Telephone: It was very strange.
not like him, very secretive.
it sounds like he's made a decision to run, which would be smart.
no, I don't think he's running at all.
I think it's just the opposite.
there was a determination about him, like he was going to fight.
Jim, I know he has a call at the studio this afternoon.
would you mind meeting me there?
I'm really worried about him.
of course. I'll be right over.
stage 4.
Yeah. I got you.
David.
Yeah.
keep it together.
man: Cut.
print it.
OK, turn around, guys.
let's set up for Billy's run.
second Man: Ok, move it along.
get ready for the reverse angle.
let's go, fellas.
gentlemen, these are blanks.
only aim upward.
there's a wad of paper that comes out and can injure someone.
[Knock On Door]
we're readyforyou, Billy.
OK.
I'll cue the guns on your leap, and you do the fall, ok?
OK, let's walkthrough it once.
Ann: Billy, over here.
what are you doing here?
take her to the airport, Jim.
Billy, something isn't reading right.
do you need help?
I'm going to break it wide open.
the police have got to get into it.
and when it explodes, I don't want Ann here.
get her on a plane.
Billy
please, Jim.
here we go.
man: Everybody settle down. Ready.
man: Everybody settle down. Ready.
OK. This is a take.
Qiet, please.
OK, roll sound.
[men Speaking Chinese]
action!
[Yelling]
Waah...
[Gunshot]
Hey, what's happening here?
what happened?
what's wrong?
my, God! He's hurt.
[Ann Screaming]
somebody call a doctor!
don't just stand there!
[Siren]
the bullet fragmented as it passed through at an upward angle,
iiterally smashing the bone structure of the face.
what are his chances of having a normal appearance?
there'll be extensive structural changes, a great deal of scartissue.
he'll be permanently altered, of course, but presentable, in any case.
hmm.
thankyou, Doctor.
Jim: Hey, Billy, are you awake?
Yes.
I've been talking with your surgeon.
the surgery will be tomorrow.
this is a very private hospital.
no one will know.
billy: Good.
then you still want to go through with this?
Yes.
the only reason I've considered this,
Mr. Lo, is the simple argument:
should you walk upon the street, undoubtedly there will be another attempt upon your life.
then you agree?
there'll have to be a complete falsification of documents, death certificate, and somebody will have to inform the press you've taken a turn for the worse
relapse. Then there's the question of a change of identity.
a new identification has already been taken care of.
we should tell Ann.
no.
no one else must know.
if she knows, she could be in danger.
a public funeral? Open casket?
after all, he is a celebrity.
don't worry, John.
it'll be a very believable funeral.
[Clears Throat]
they have some interesting people here.
it could be a story.
miss Morris.
[Spits]
Carl: You're dead.
come on, Ann.
do you hear me? You're dead.
cool it.
excuse us. Thank you.
let us through. Easy.
thank you.
Jim: No, Ann.
for $10, he could have you killed.
Yes, I understand. It's cheap.
I'm glad you understand, and I'm glad you're pulling yourselftogether.
Oh, no. I'm not going to cry anymore.
God knows the police would like to nail them...
but there's no way to prove it.
don't you understand anything??!
everybody looked at them, but not one person could see anything!
the gentlemen from the Chinese syndicate and the cash have arrived in Macau.
fine, fine. Now, you sure it's a good idea, our stopping in the sanitarium to see this Morris girl?
she's a very valuable piece of merchandise.
and ifwe can bring her into the family, it will show all the other would-be rebels how complete our control is.
woman: You go ahead. I'll see you later.
Hello, Mr. Marshall.
Hello, Doctor. How's Ann?
we're very pleased with her recovery.
it's been, um...
a long haul.
3 weeks?
Mm-hmm.
for a trauma severe enough to bring on physical paralysis, a 3-week recovery is extremely good.
Oh, well, may I go down to see her?
Absolutely. If you hadn't come out,
I would have called you.
she's ready to see a familiar face.
you must understand she's still depressed.
is it time to go in?
Hi, Annie.
Jim.
[Chuckles Softly]
Oh, I brought you a little present.
I-it's beautiful.
I hear nothing but good things about you.
no lies?
no lies.
would a newspaperman lie?
now I'm getting worried.
but, Jim, actually,
I'm feeling a lot better.
good.
at least
I'm able to deal with people now.
you know, maybe you should get out of here, go back to the States when you're feeling better, hmm?
I've been thinking about that, too, but I don't want to yet.
not just yet.
Yes, but more important than that,
I think we ought to try to see for ourselves what's going on in her head, what kind of a threat she could be to us.
I don't want to leave that to Carl or to anybody else.
we're here.
there.
Steiner: That's the newspaperman,
Jim Marshall. You know, I've got a hunch that one of these days, we're going to have to cram his typewriter up his ass.
Oh?
it's the blonde.
good afternoon, Miss Morris.
we haven't off. icially met, but my name is Steiner. This is Dr. Land.
how do you do, Miss Morris?
we were informed of your improvement.
Oh, you are so beautiful.
beautiful.
what do you want?
we were just passing by.
we wondered if we could do anything for you.
is there something you might need?
there's nothing I need, ok?
your album is doing very well on the charts.
it's going to make lots of money.
we know, Miss Morris, what has happened-- the terrible strain that you have been under.
we hope that possibly we can assist somehow.
you know, maybe get your career moving again.
get out!
there's nothing
get out!
it's Dr. Land's intention to try to help you, Ann.
he could be
you murderers!
get out of here.
get out!
[Growls]
get out of here!
rude bitch.
well, one rebel begets another.
it's the Billy Lo syndrome.
a virulent disease, often terminal.
Steiner: Stick, she seemed to know you.
your face did something for her.
never met her.
we have to go to Macau.
we'll see about her when we return.
Grr. Bitch!
what are you up to, Billy?
I'm giving myself a new face...
before and after.
much better.
I've already told you, Billy.
you're going to have a normal appearance again.
you'll see. Wait till tomorrow when those bandages come off.
P. A. Dr. Ferguson, please report to the nurses' station.
well, excuse me.
Dr. Ferguson, please report to the nurses' station.
the new Billy Lo.
mister, can I hire you to follow that hydrofoil?
I won't be able to stay with him once they get out ofthe harbor.
those hydrofoils do 40 easy.
where do you think they're going?
I've seen that boat in Macau a couple of times.
that's what I think.
maybe we could get a head start on them.
well, it's only an hour's ride in any case.
macau.
[Telephone Rings]
Yeah.
I know who killed Billy.
Ann?
Yes. Jim, I know who killed him.
I'm not sure I heard you right.
what did you say?
they came to the hospital.
one of them was at the shooting.
look, Ann, why don't you come in, and we'll take it to the police?
where are you?
did you leave the hospital?
never mind. The police aren't the answer.
boat Driver: Hey, mister, is that the guy you've been waiting for?
that's him.
[Horn Blowing]
I'll make it worth yourwhile to wait for me.
you're not going to rob a casino, are you?
I don't want to run a getaway boat.
no, no.
will you be here, no matter how late?
I got nothing better going.
[Loud Drumming]
parade, parade. Damn. What the hell?
can't we get out of here somehow?
back this thing up or something.
man: There's a taxi behind us.
it will be ending soon, and they will move to another street.
give them the horn.
let's get out of here. Run over 'em.
[Horn Honking]
[Firecrackers]
chinese gold.
they've been waiting for an hour.
we were held up by a damn fool lion dance.
Oh, boy. Huh.
these characters.
Ah, well, well, well.
[Chuckles]
how do you do, Doctor? Very nice seeing you.
Dr. Land: And how are you? Sit down.
well, maybe we don't need to even count it.
[Speaking Chinese]
[Laughter]
maybe we better.
[All Speaking Chinese]
see you both at ringside.
doctor.
Dr. Land.
yes?
the money's all here, every dollar.
I'd be surprised if it weren't.
Where'd you come from?
how'd you get here?
guards!
Carl!
guards! Guards!
guards! Guards!
guards! Guards!
guards!
get him!
Carl!
stay away from me, you bastard.
Hyah!
Hoo...yah!
Carl, come! Come!
get him! Get him.
Steiner: Carl, duck!
somebody take care ofthe doctor.
Steiner: Carl, let him go!
Carl, you damn fool, the fight's tonight!
Carl, come on back here, you hear me??!
Carl!
Steiner: You know, I don't understand it.
if some other organization was trying to kill you, they'd have just picked you off. with a rifle.
stick: I can't place him, but there was something there
I recognized.
stick is right.
there was something different about that man.
he not only wanted to kill, he wanted to punish me as well.
[Crowd Cheering]
referee: To your corner. To your corner.
one. Get back.
get back, Miller, to your corner.
back to your corner.
2. Get back, Miller.
ha ha ha!
they are hurting bad, as they have throughout the early...
[Crowd Booing]
[Speaking Chinese]
kill him, Carl!
[Bell Rings]
all right. Back up. Back up!
[ crowd Booing ] - All right. Get back. Get back.
it's going to cost you a round, Miller.
[Crowd Booing]
let it go.
what must be done is being done.
Billy?
[Bell Rings]
Uhh!
Uhh!
ha ha ha!
ha ha ha!
he retained the crown by knocking out Lo Chen in 2 minutes, 8 seconds in the seventh round.
[Crowd Cheering]
[Bell Ringing]
announcer: The winner by knockout, and still world's heavyweight champion,
Carl Miller!
[Crowd Cheering]
[Everyone Talking Excitedly]
woman: Carl!
Carl, you won! You won!
reporter: Tell me.
Carl, is there going to be a rematch?
Carl, are you going to fight this guy again?
second Reporter: Carl, did he hurt you in round 4?
Carl, how soon are you going to have a rematch?
turn this way, Carl!
will there be a rematch, Carl?
ha ha ha!
Hey, hey, hey. Ha ha ha!
reporter: All right. He didn't hurt you, did he, tonight?
gotten any complaints?
Carl: Hey! I'm just going to get a shower.
I want to be looking beautiful for the rest of these photographs.
there's plenty of champagne for everybody.
you won't get lonely.
who are you?
I'm June.
this is my new girlfriend.
[Applause]
I'd like you to take plenty of pictures of her.
man: Over here, honey. Over here.
look over here at the camera, honey.
where are you from, honey?
Kansas City.
who the hell are you?
get going, fella.
Miller.
Christ! Billy Lo.
man: Carl.
Carl, you all right?
something's wrong!
man: Carl, what's happening? Carl?
Carl, open the door!
Hyah!
man: What's the matter in there?
open the door.
[Pounding On Door]
[Screaming]
you lose, Carl Miller.
man: Carl! Carl!
man: Look at him.
Jeez!
[Everyone Talking At Once]
he was killed with a hundred people outside the door.
they found a wig and a face mask of an old man.
that's all.
man On Phone: Yes, sir.
and you and the rest of the passive body guards simply stood around, you and 1 00 other people.
isn't that true?
Yes, sir.
you say the girl is with the newspaperman now?
Yes.
you admitted that you could have killed someone in that state of mind.
you still think you recognized Billy's voice?
I told you before.
I wouldn't mistake Billy's voice.
can't you believe me?
that's one of my weaknesses.
I'm one of the world's most gullible men.
I'll take you home.
no, no. That's all right.
I have my car right outside.
you're sure?
you can leave this here, ok?
Yeah.
she's coming back.
Dr. Land: Don't let her out ofyour sight.
and put a couple of fellows following on that newspaperman.
Yes, sir.
you two stay with Marshall.
we'll follow the girl.
Dr. Land: Steiner.
I'm now convinced that the man who attacked me was in disguise.
the way he moved.
you know something, Doctor?
if I wasn't positive that Billy was dead...
did you look in the casket at the mortuary?
of course I looked in the casket.
he didn't look exactly the same, but what the hell?
they never look exactly the same.
where was he buried?
the Buddhist cemetery, Hangzhou Road.
have him dug up.
[Telephone Ringing]
Yeah. Marshall.
billy: Hi, Jim.
Billy, I've heard all about it.
Ann is convinced you're alive.
I had to risk it.
I thought she was going to shoot Carl or one of the others.
well, she still may kill somebody.
I've got the gun, but if she sits around and thinks about it, she might get the crazies again.
OK. I'll meet her in the school at Southampton.
what time?
in an hour.
OK. If I can find her.
I'll ring you up again at 10:00 to let you know how it went.
fine.
thank you, gentlemen.
Billy?
Billy.
I wasn't going to see you again.
I didn't want you to see me.
Billy, it's all right.
you have to know that.
no. Not to me, it isn't.
maybe later, but I have to get used to myself first.
the man she's talking to has to be Billy Lo.
Yes. Well, we just had word from the cemetery, so I'm not in the least surprised.
now, we're sending you some help.
they're close by, and they should be there very shortly.
Ann, you could have been killed.
you would have been just one more life they ruined.
go back to the States, please.
will you do that?
Billy, I can't.
[Motorcycle Engines Rewing]
get in your car and go!
they're still a few blocks away.
go!
go!
they split. She's going to her car.
land: Where's he going?
to the other side of the orphanage, I think.
let a couple fellows follow him and take 2 more men and pick her up.
we can use her for bait.
[Motorcycles Approaching]
Aah!
call him over.
Mr. Marshall!
somebody wants to talk to you.
Steiner: A little closer, Mr. Marshall.
miss Morris was picked up tonight.
Billy's going to call you at about 1 0: 00.
you tapped my phone.
how clever.
tell Billy to come to the Tai Yun warehouse in Kowloon at exactly 1: 00 in the morning.
we'll let the girl go when Billy comes in, one for one.
why should I believe you'll do that?
don't change the equation, Mr. Marshall.
one for one. Don't add any numbers.
Billy for the girl. It's that simple.
Oh, and Mr. Marshall, you should be very... very careful.
you can learn a lot in a job like yours, but knowledge can become a terrible burden.
good evening.
Jim Marshall's desk.
is Jim there?
no. He isn't.
Oh, hold on a second. He just walked in.
Yeah.
Hi, Jim. - Billy...
my phone is tapped.
Ann is being held by the syndicate.
I couldn't get her to leave.
have you talked to them?
just now. They want an exchange you for her, even up, or so they say.
you could go to the police.
no. That would just get her killed.
what do they want me to do?
stick.
you better go over there and back them up.
insurance.
you've got 6 men over there already.
we had a pack of men at Macau.
here he comes.
he's inside. Let's get him.
billy: Ann?
Ann?
Ann.
let's go!
Billy.
Billy, hurry.
we have to move quickly.
Billy, quick, they're across the street.
they're across the street. Hurry. Hurry!
it's barricaded. Try the windows.
try to walk. Hurry!
don't show yourself, no matter what you hear.
Yeah, ok.
let's go.
let's go.
you two take the aisles.
take the front.
Aah!
Aah!
Hyah!
chewy, look for the others.
take the back.
you take the back.
take off. the helmet.
take off. the helmet.
chewy, Chewy!
Aah! Hyah!
Aah!
Oh-aah!
Ohh!
Aah!
shit.
Where's the doctor?
red Pepper.
red Pepper restaurant?
Yeah.
stick.
stick!
I'd better alert Hakim and Pasqual.
anybody in the warehouse?
[Yells In Chinese]
that's impossible.
[Yells In Chinese]
Aah!
Woo!
Aah-ohh!
Wah-ah!
[Yelling]
[Yelling]
Wah!
Wah!
how doyou like that?
Wah!
[Both Yelling]
Hyah!
Chi-yaah!
Ah-waah!
[Crack]
[Creak]
Woo-aah!
[Groaning]
[gasping]
[gasping]
[Bones Crack]
Steiner: Hakim!
Hakim!
Hakim?
Hakim!
Hah!
glad you could finally make it, Billy.
[Crack]
Ahh!
shit!
[Bones Cracking]
Aah!
[Moaning]
Aah...ooh.
wax!
Aah!
goddamn it! Son of a bitch!
goddamn bastard!
Goddamn! Aah!
[Screaming]
will this be the song I'll be singing
tomorrow?
will the notes from some magical flute
sail on into the sky?
is this a glad song?
makes my heart go crazy mad song?
or will the sound turn to silence
and leave a surprising theme disremembered
to grieve us?
will this be the song I'll be singing
tomorrow?
will the piper be paid
for the tunes that he played by and by?
is this the best rhyme?
major, minor, one-in-one time?
or will the tune fall from favor
forever?
a yesternight song ofpast times
together
will this be the song I'll be singing
tomorrow?
you need to drink, child.
and eat.
isn't there anything else?
the Dothraki have two things in abundance:
grass and horses. People can't live on grass.
in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
it murders all other grass.
the Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything
that's the way the world will end.
it'll get easier.
Khaleesi!
your hands.
we're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.
magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.
you'd be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
as you wish, your Grace.
well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
what did Ned Stark want you for?
buying from a slaver?
selling to one
some poachers I caught on my land.
under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.
you can rest assured of that.
better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.
my mother's been looking for you.
we ride for King's Landing today.
before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
what good will my sympathies do them?
none. But it is expected of you.
your absence has already been noted.
the boy means nothing to me.
and I can't stand the wailing of women.
one word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!
go! Tell her.
but first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them.
do you understand?- You can't
do you understand?
the prince will remember that, little lord.
I hope so.
if he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.
Ah. Time for breakfast.
bread. And two of those little fish.
and a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
and bacon, burned black.
hyah.
little brother. - Beloved siblings.
is Bran going to die?
apparently not.
what do you mean? - The Maester says the boy may live.
it's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
only the gods know for certain.
all the rest of us can do is pray.
the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going.
it's ridiculous even for you.
Where's your sense of wonder?
the greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
and go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
no, I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world.
the children don't need to hear your filth.
come.
even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.
give me a good clean death any day.
speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.
death is so final, whereas life...
Ah, life is full of possibilities.
I hope the boy does wake.
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
my dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
my dear brother, you wound me.
you know how much I love my family.
please.
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.
this is your home. I'm your guest.
handsome one, isn't he?
I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty.
he was a fighter too
tried to beat the fever that took him.
forgive me.
it's the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
it was years ago.
robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care.
the boy looked just like him.
such a little thing...
a bird without feathers.
they came to take his body away and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.
that little bundle.
they took him away and I never saw him again.
never have visited the crypt, never.
I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful.
perhaps this time she'll listen.
a sword for the wall?
I already have one. - Good man.
have you swung it yet? - Of course I have.
at someone, I mean.
it's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man.
you realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing.
let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the wall
wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot.
we're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
we've guarded the kingdoms for 8, 000 years.
is it "we" already?
have you taken your vows then? - Soon enough.
give my regards to The Night's Watch.
I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.
and if not?
it's only for life.
thank you, Nymeria.
septa Mordane says I have to do it again.
my things weren't properly folded, she says.
who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.
it's good you've got help. - Watch.
Nymeria, gloves.
impressive. - Shut up.
Nymeria, gloves!
I have something for you.
and it has to be packed very carefully.
a present? - Close the door.
this is no toy.
be careful you don't cut yourself.
it's so skinny. - So are you.
I had the blacksmith make it for you special.
it won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough.
I can be quick.
you'll have to work at it every day.
how does it feel?
do you like the balance?
I think so.
first lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
I know which end to use.
I'm going to miss you.
careful.
all the best swords have names, you know.
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.
I've got a needle of my own.
I came to say goodbye to Bran.
you've said it.
I wish I could be here when you wake up.
I'm going north with Uncle Benjen.
I'm taking the black.
I know we always talked about seeing the wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better.
I'll know my way around by then.
I'll be a sworn brother of The Night's Watch.
we can go out walking beyond the wall, if you're not afraid.
I want you to leave.
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
you came back a year later with another woman's son.
and now you're leaving again.
I have no choice.
that's what men always say when honor calls.
that's what you tell your families, tell yourselves.
you do have a choice.
and you've made it.
I can't do it, Ned.
I really can't. - You can.
you must.
you've said goodbye to Bran?
he's not going to die. I know it.
you Starks are hard to kill.
my mother?
she was very kind. - Good.
next time I see you, you'll be all in black.
it was always my color.
farewell, Snow. - And you, Stark.
there's great honor serving in The Night's Watch.
the Starks have manned the wall for thousands of years.
and you are a Stark.
you might not have my name, but you have my blood.
is my mother alive?
does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going?
does she care?
the next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother.
I promise.
gods, this is country!
I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
I've half a mind to go with you.
what do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
you should have asked me 20 years ago.
there were wars to fight, women to marry
we never had the chance to be young.
I recall a few chances.
there was that one... Oh, what was her name?
that common girl of yours?
Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Bessie. She was one of yours.
Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits.
yours was... Aleena?
no. You told me once. Meryl?
your bastard's mother?
Wylla. - That's it.
she must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.
you never told me what she looked like.
nor will I.
we were at war.
none of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.
you're too hard on yourself. You always have been.
I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already.
the worst thing about your coronation
I'll never get to hit you again.
trust me, that's not the worst thing.
there was a rider in the night.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.
what of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
a knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
she's little more than a child.
soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
tell me we're not speaking of this. - Oh, it's unspeakable to you?
what her father did to your family-- that was unspeakable.
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
but you can't get your hands on this one, can you?
this Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100, 000 men in his horde.
even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.
they have no ships, Robert.
there are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
if the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, - the scum will join him. - He will not cross.
and if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea.
there's a war coming, Ned.
I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming.
sit.
you'll be fed.
untie them.
Ah, rapers.
they were given a choice no doubt-- castration or the wall.
most choose the knife.
not impressed by your new brothers?
lovely thing about the watch
you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
why do you read so much?
look at me and tell me what you see.
is this a trick?
what you see is a dwarf.
if I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die.
alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
things are expected of me.
my father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.
until your brother killed that King.
Yes, until my brother killed him.
life is full of these little ironies.
my sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him.
I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree?
but how?
well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind.
and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
that's why I read so much, Jon Snow.
and you?
what's your story, bastard?
ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.
a bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of The Night's Watch, alongside his Valiant brothers-in-arms.
the Night's Watch protects the realm from
Ah, yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.
you're a smart boy.
you don't believe that nonsense.
everything's better with some wine in the belly.
it's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.
you'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.
we need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention
I don't care about appointments!
I'll make the appointments.
we'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
very good, my Lord.
my Lady.
when was the last time you left this room?
I have to take care of him.
he's not going to die, mother.
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
what if he's wrong?
bran needs me. - Rickon needs you.
he's six. He doesn't know what's happening.
he follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
fire.
you stay here. I'll come back.
you're not supposed to be here.
no one is supposed to be here.
it's a mercy. He's dead already.
No!
have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
everywhere? Even in the east?
no dragon. Brave men kill them.
it is known. - It is known.
a trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
the moon?
he told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky.
but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.
out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
moon is no egg.
moon is goddess-- wife of sun.
it is known. - It is known.
leave me with her.
why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
men like to talk when they're happy.
before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
how old were you? - I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
nine?!
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.
first you must learn.
can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Yes. - Will it take three years?
no.
welcome.
what I am about to tell you must remain between us.
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.
I think he was thrown.
the boy was always sure-footed before.
someone tried to kill him twice.
Why? Why murder an innocent child?
unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
saw what, my lady? - I don't know.
but I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
we already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
did you notice the dagger the killer used?
it's too fine a weapon for such a man.
the blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.
someone gave it to him.
they come into our home and try to murder my brother?
if it's war they want - If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
what, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?
too easily words of war become acts of war.
we don't know the truth yet.
lord Stark must be told of this.
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
I'll ride to King's Landing. - No.
there must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
I will go myself. - Mother, you can't.
I must.
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
let me accompany you at least.
the Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
what about Bran?
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.
bran's life is in their hands now.
no, Khaleesi.
you must look in his eyes always.
love comes in at the eyes.
it is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
finish a man?
kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.
Magisters sold their palaces.
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.
they say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
well, she sounds like an interesting woman.
I-- I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
you will make him like it, Khaleesi.
men want what they've never had.
and the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.
are you a slave, Khaleesi?
then don't make love like a slave.
very good, Khaleesi.
out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
I-- I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
if he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
no.
No!
tonight I would look upon your face.
pardon me, Ser.
do I frighten you so much, girl?
or is it him there making you shake?
he frightens me too.
look at that face.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.
why won't he speak to me? - He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.
since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
he speaks damn well with his sword though.
ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.
the royal executioner.
what is it, sweet lady?
does the hound frighten you?
away with you, dog.
you're scaring my lady.
I don't like to see you upset.
the Sun is finally shining.
come walk with me.
stay, lady.
I probably shouldn't have any more.
father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
my princess can drink as much as she wants.
don't worry-- you're safe with me.
I'll get you!
Arya!
what are you doing here?
go away. - Your sister?
and who are you, boy? - Mycah, my Lord.
he the butcher's boy. - He's my friend.
a butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?
pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
she asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
it's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
and you're not a Knight.
only a butcher's boy.
that was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
stop it! - Arya, stay out of this.
I won't hurt him...
much.
Arya!
filthy little bitch!
no no, stop it, stop it, both of you.
you're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Arya! - Nymeria!
Arya! - Nymeria!
no.
no. Please don't.
Arya, leave him alone.
my prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.
stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
then go!
don't touch me.
the wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
you've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.
go on-- run.
go! Leave now!
it's a direwolf. - I'll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
go!
Arya!
Arya! Arya!
Arya-aa!
Arya!
my lord!
my lord! They found her.
she's unharmed.
where is she? - She's been taken directly before the King.
who took her? - The Lannisters found her.
Arya-aa! - Right, get back.
the Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
back! Back to the inn.
all back!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
are you hurt? - No.
Oh, it's all right.
what is the meaning of this?
why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
how dare you speak to your King in that manner?
quiet, woman.
sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.
but we need to get this business done quickly.
your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.
that animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
that's not true!
she just... Bit him a little.
he was hurting Mycah. - Joff told us what happened.
you and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
that's not what happened! -Yes it is!
they all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
liar! - Shut up!
enough!
he tells me one thing, she tells me another.
seven hells! What am I to make of this?
Where's your other daughter, Ned? - In bed asleep.
she's not.
Sansa, come here, darling.
now, child...
tell me what happened.
tell it all and tell it true.
it's a great crime to lie to a King.
I don't know.
I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.
I didn't see. - Liar!
liar liar liar! - Arya!
Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. - Liar liar liar!
stop! Arya! - She's as wild as that animal of hers.
I want her punished. -What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?
damn it, children fight. It's over.
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
you let that little girl disarm you?
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.
I'll do the same with my son. - Gladly, your Grace.
and what of the direwolf?
what of the beast that savaged your son?
I'd forgot the damned wolf.
we found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
no? So be it.
we have another wolf.
as you will.
you can't mean it. - A direwolf's no pet.
get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
he doesn't mean Lady, does he?
no no, not lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!
she's good! - Lady wasn't there!
you leave her alone! - Stop them. Don't let them do it.
please please, it wasn't Lady!
is this your command
your Grace?
where is the beast? - Chained up outside, your Grace.
ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
no.
Jory...
take the girls to their rooms.
if it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
is this some trick?
the wolf is of the north.
she deserves better than a butcher.
the butcher's boy
you rode him down?
he ran...
not very fast.
you need to drink, child.
and eat.
isn't there anything else?
the Dothraki have two things in abundance:
grass and horses. People can't live on grass.
in the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
it murders all other grass.
the Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything
that's the way the world will end.
it'll get easier.
Khaleesi!
your hands.
we're still not far from Pentos, your Grace.
magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality.
you'd be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
as you wish, your Grace.
well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
what did Ned Stark want you for?
buying from a slaver?
selling to one
some poachers I caught on my land.
under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense.
you can rest assured of that.
better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle.
my mother's been looking for you.
we ride for King's Landing today.
before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
what good will my sympathies do them?
none. But it is expected of you.
your absence has already been noted.
the boy means nothing to me.
and I can't stand the wailing of women.
one word and I'll hit you again.
I'm telling mother!
go! Tell her.
but first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them.
do you understand?- You can't
do you understand?
the prince will remember that, little lord.
I hope so.
if he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.
Ah. Time for breakfast.
bread. And two of those little fish.
and a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
and bacon, burned black.
hyah.
little brother. - Beloved siblings.
is Bran going to die?
apparently not.
what do you mean? - The Maester says the boy may live.
it's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
only the gods know for certain.
all the rest of us can do is pray.
the charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
I still can't believe you're going.
it's ridiculous even for you.
Where's your sense of wonder?
the greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of The Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers.
tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
and go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
no, I just want to stand on top of the wall and piss off the edge of the world.
the children don't need to hear your filth.
come.
even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.
give me a good clean death any day.
speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree.
death is so final, whereas life...
Ah, life is full of possibilities.
I hope the boy does wake.
I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say.
my dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on.
my dear brother, you wound me.
you know how much I love my family.
please.
Oh, I would have dressed, your Grace.
this is your home. I'm your guest.
handsome one, isn't he?
I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty.
he was a fighter too
tried to beat the fever that took him.
forgive me.
it's the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
it was years ago.
robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care.
the boy looked just like him.
such a little thing...
a bird without feathers.
they came to take his body away and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.
that little bundle.
they took him away and I never saw him again.
never have visited the crypt, never.
I pray to the mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful.
perhaps this time she'll listen.

you don't believe that nonsense.
everything's better with some wine in the belly.
it's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.
you'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.
we need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention
I don't care about appointments!
I'll make the appointments.
we'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
very good, my Lord.
my Lady.
when was the last time you left this room?
I have to take care of him.
he's not going to die, mother.
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
what if he's wrong?
bran needs me. - Rickon needs you.
he's six. He doesn't know what's happening.
he follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
fire.
you stay here. I'll come back.
you're not supposed to be here.
no one is supposed to be here.
it's a mercy. He's dead already.
No!
have you ever seen a dragon? - Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
everywhere? Even in the east?
no dragon. Brave men kill them.
it is known. - It is known.
a trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
the moon?
he told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky.
but one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat.
out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.
moon is no egg.
moon is goddess-- wife of sun.
it is known. - It is known.
leave me with her.
why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
men like to talk when they're happy.
before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.
how old were you? - I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
nine?!
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.
first you must learn.
can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Yes. - Will it take three years?
no.
welcome.
what I am about to tell you must remain between us.
I don't think Bran fell from that tower.
I think he was thrown.
the boy was always sure-footed before.
someone tried to kill him twice.
Why? Why murder an innocent child?
unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
saw what, my lady? - I don't know.
but I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved.
we already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
did you notice the dagger the killer used?
it's too fine a weapon for such a man.
the blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone.
someone gave it to him.
they come into our home and try to murder my brother?
if it's war they want - If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.
what, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood?
too easily words of war become acts of war.
we don't know the truth yet.
lord Stark must be told of this.
I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
I'll ride to King's Landing. - No.
there must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
I will go myself. - Mother, you can't.
I must.
I'll send hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
let me accompany you at least.
the Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
what about Bran?
I have prayed to the seven for more than a month.
bran's life is in their hands now.
no, Khaleesi.
you must look in his eyes always.
love comes in at the eyes.
it is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
finish a man?
kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia.
Magisters sold their palaces.
Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours.
they say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
well, she sounds like an interesting woman.
I-- I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.
you will make him like it, Khaleesi.
men want what they've never had.
and the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch.
are you a slave, Khaleesi?
then don't make love like a slave.
very good, Khaleesi.
out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.
I-- I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
if he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?
no.
No!
tonight I would look upon your face.
pardon me, Ser.
do I frighten you so much, girl?
or is it him there making you shake?
he frightens me too.
look at that face.
I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser.
why won't he speak to me? - He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years.
since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
he speaks damn well with his sword though.
ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice.
the royal executioner.
what is it, sweet lady?
does the hound frighten you?
away with you, dog.
you're scaring my lady.
I don't like to see you upset.
the Sun is finally shining.
come walk with me.
stay, lady.
I probably shouldn't have any more.
father only lets us have one cup at feasts.
my princess can drink as much as she wants.
don't worry-- you're safe with me.
I'll get you!
Arya!
what are you doing here?
go away. - Your sister?
and who are you, boy? - Mycah, my Lord.
he the butcher's boy. - He's my friend.
a butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh?
pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are.
she asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to.
I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
it's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick.
and you're not a Knight.
only a butcher's boy.
that was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?
stop it! - Arya, stay out of this.
I won't hurt him...
much.
Arya!
filthy little bitch!
no no, stop it, stop it, both of you.
you're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!
I'll gut you, you little cunt!
Arya! - Nymeria!
Arya! - Nymeria!
no.
no. Please don't.
Arya, leave him alone.
my prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you.
stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.
then go!
don't touch me.
the wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
you've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey.
go on-- run.
go! Leave now!
it's a direwolf. - I'll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
go!
Arya!
Arya! Arya!
Arya-aa!
Arya!
my lord!
my lord! They found her.
she's unharmed.
where is she? - She's been taken directly before the King.
who took her? - The Lannisters found her.
Arya-aa! - Right, get back.
the Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
back! Back to the inn.
all back!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
are you hurt? - No.
Oh, it's all right.
what is the meaning of this?
why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
how dare you speak to your King in that manner?
quiet, woman.
sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.
but we need to get this business done quickly.
your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son.
that animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
that's not true!
she just... Bit him a little.
he was hurting Mycah. - Joff told us what happened.
you and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
that's not what happened! -Yes it is!
they all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
liar! - Shut up!
enough!
he tells me one thing, she tells me another.
seven hells! What am I to make of this?
Where's your other daughter, Ned? - In bed asleep.
she's not.
Sansa, come here, darling.
now, child...
tell me what happened.
tell it all and tell it true.
it's a great crime to lie to a King.
I don't know.
I don't remember. Everything happened so fast.
I didn't see. - Liar!
liar liar liar! - Arya!
Hey, stop it! That's enough of that. - Liar liar liar!
stop! Arya! - She's as wild as that animal of hers.
I want her punished. -What would you have me do, whip her through the streets?
damn it, children fight. It's over.
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
you let that little girl disarm you?
Ned, see to it that your daughter is disciplined.
I'll do the same with my son. - Gladly, your Grace.
and what of the direwolf?
what of the beast that savaged your son?
I'd forgot the damned wolf.
we found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace.
no? So be it.
we have another wolf.
as you will.
you can't mean it. - A direwolf's no pet.
get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
he doesn't mean Lady, does he?
no no, not lady! Lady didn't bite anyone!
she's good! - Lady wasn't there!
you leave her alone! - Stop them. Don't let them do it.
please please, it wasn't Lady!
is this your command
your Grace?
where is the beast? - Chained up outside, your Grace.
ser Ilyn, do me the honor.
no.
Jory...
take the girls to their rooms.
if it must be done, then I'll do it myself.
is this some trick?
the wolf is of the north.
she deserves better than a butcher.
the butcher's boy
you rode him down?
he ran...
not very fast.
the little lord's been dreaming again.
we have visitors. - I don't want to see anyone.
Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.
anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
I don't want to go. - Neither do i.
but robb's lord of winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.
Hodor!
Hodor? - Help bran down the hall.
Hodor.
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
any man of the night's watch is welcome at winterfell.
any man of the night's watch, but not i, eh, boy?
I'm not your boy, lannister.
I'm lord of winterfell while my father is away.
then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
so it's true.
Hello, bran.
do you remember anything about what happened?
he has no memory of that day.
curious. - Why are you here?
would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?
my neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, hodor.
do you like to ride, bran? - Yes.
well, I mean I did like to.
the boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it?
with the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf.
my father will rejoice to hear it.
I have a gift for you.
give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.
you must shape the horse to the rider.
start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
will I really be able to ride?
you will.
on horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
you've done my brother a kindness.
the hospitality of winterfell is yours.
spare me your false courtesies, lord stark.
there's a brothel outside your walls.
there I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
couldn't resist some northern ass?
if you like redheads, ask for ros.
come to see me off, greyjoy? Kind of you.
your master doesn't seem to like lannisters.
he's not my master. - No, of course not.
what happened here? Where is lady stark?
why didn't she receive me?
she wasn't feeling well. - She's not in winterfell, is she?
where did she go? - My lady's whereabouts -My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
tell me, how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?
I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in lannisport.
I believe your uncles were responsible?
must have been a pretty sight. - Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
Yes, a great victory for your people.
shame how it all turned out. - We were outnumbered 10 to one
a stupid rebellion then.
I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle.
now here you are, your enemy's squire.
careful, imp. - I've offended you.
forgive me, it's been a rough morning.
anyway, don't despair.
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it.
your next tumble with ros is on me.
I'll try not to wear her out.
left foot forward. Good.
now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
put all your weight behind it.
what in seven hells is that?
Pyp: they'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
tell them your name.
Samwell tarly, of horn hill - I mean, I was of horn hill.
I've come to take the black. - Come to take the black pudding.
well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.
Rast...
see what he can do.
please, no more. - On your feet.
pick up your sword.
hit him till he finds his feet.
it seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south.
now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon!
again, harder.
I yield!
enough!
he yielded.
looks like the bastard's in love.
all right then, lord snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.
you two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.
all you've got to do is get past the bastard.
are you sure you want to do this? - No.
yield yield yield! I yield.
we're done for today.
go clean the armory.
that's all you're good for.
well fought! - Piss off.
did he hurt you?
I've had worse.
you can call me sam... If you want.
my mother calls me sam - it's not going to get any easier, you know?
you're going to have to defend yourself.
why didn't you get up and fight?
I wanted to.
I just couldn't. - Why not?
I'm a coward.
my father always says so. - The wall's no place for cowards.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I just... Wanted to thank you.
a bloody coward.
people saw us talking to him.
now they'll think we're cowards too.
you're too stupid to be a coward.
you're too stupid to be a - Quick now, before summer's over.
C'mere!
Jorah: vaes dothrak - the city of the horselords.
a pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs
best these savages can do. - These are my people now.
you shouldn't call them savages. - I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.
this is my army.
Khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
if my brother was given an army of dothraki, could you conquer the seven kingdoms?
the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
they fear any water their horses can't drink.
but if they did?
king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
and you know these men? - I fought beside them once, long ago. Now ned stark wants my head.
he drove me from my land.
you sold slaves.
Aye.
Why? - I had no money and an expensive wife.
and where is she now? - In another place, with another man.
your grace? - Yes, my dear?
they call you the last dragon...
they do.
you have dragon's blood in your veins?
it's entirely possible.
what happened to the dragons?
I was told that brave men killed them all.
the brave men didn't kill dragons.
the brave men rode them.
rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization his world has ever seen.
the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne, which the usurper is keeping warm for me.
the swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them...
melted together like so many candles.
I have always wanted to see a dragon.
there is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
really. Why dragons?
they can fly.
and wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else...
far away.
and they can kill.
anyone or anything that tries to hurt them
gets burned away to nothing...
...like so many candles.
Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,
I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
I was not locked in. I have seen things.
what have you seen? - I've seen...
a man from asshal with a dagger of real dragonglass.
ve seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
and I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.
so...
have you seen one?
a pirate ship? - A dragon.
no.
no, the last one died many years before I was born.
I'll tell you what I have seen: their skulls.
they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep.
when I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.
when I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.
the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong.
skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
but as you got closer to the iron throne...
they got bigger and bigger and bigger.
there was ghiscar and valryon, vermithrax, essovius-Archonel, meraxes, vhagar...
and balerion the dread...
...whose fire forged the seven kingdoms into one.
what happened to the skulls?
I don't know.
the usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.
scattered to the wind.
that's very sad.
Yes, it is.
what did I buy you for?
to make me sad? - No, your grace.
to, uh, teach your sister.
to teach my sister how to be a better lover?
you think I bought you to make khal drogo happy?
Oh, you pretty little idiot.
go on then. Get on with it.
someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
and one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.
all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince
what if I have a girl?
gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
what if I only have girls?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Jeyne poole's mother had five children - all of them girls.
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
but what if?
well, if you only had girls,
I suppose the throne would pass to prince joffrey's little brother.
and everyone would hate me.
nobody could ever hate you.
Joffrey does. - Nonsense.
why would you say such a thing?
that business with the wolves? Sansa, I've told you a hundred times:
a direwolf is not - Please shut up about it.
do you remember your lessons?
who built the iron throne?
Aegon the conqueror.
and who built the red keep?
Maegor the cruel.
and how many years did it take to build
my grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
they were killed on the orders of king aerys, yes.
the mad king. - Commonly known as the mad king.
why were they killed?
you should be speak to your father about these matters.
I don't want to speak to my father - ever.
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
no, I won't.
it's the hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords.
the king's tournament.
I assure you the hand wants no part of it.
call it what you will, lord stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters.
dreadful. - If you can't keep the king's peace, perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.
I need more men. - Ned: you'll get 50.
lord baelish will see it paid for. - I will?
you found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace.
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left.
thank you, my lord hand, ser.
they will be put to good use.
the sooner this is over, the better.
the realm prospers from such events, my lord.
they give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
now...
if there's nothing else, my lords?
Oh, this heat.
on days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.
until tomorrow, my lord - I've been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn.
lord arryn?
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.
his sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
lord jon often came to me for counsel.
Why?
I have been grand maester for many years.
kings and hands have come to me for advice since
what did jon want the night before he died?
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.
a book?
what book?
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord.
a ponderous tome.
no, I'd like to read it.
the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
harkon umber, first of his name, born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber in the 183rd year after aegon's landing, at the last hearth.
blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
as I said, my lord, a ponderous read.
did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
he did not, my lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Jon's death... - Such a tragedy.
...did he say anything to you during his final hours?
nothing of import, my lord.
Oh - there was one phrase "the seed is strong," I think it was.
the seed is strong? - Mmm.
what does that mean?
the dying mind is a demented mind, lord stark.
for all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
and you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
what else could it be?
poison.
a disturbing thought.
no no no, I don't think it likely.
the hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Yes, women, cravens...
and eunuchs.
did you know that lord varys is a eunuch?
everybody knows that.
yes yes, of course.
how that sort of person found himself on the king's council,
I will never know.
I've taken enough of your time.
no trouble at all, my lord. It's a great honor
thank you.
I'll find my own way out.
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
it's a hard fall down these steps.
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats?
Syrio says. - He says every swordsman should study cats.
they're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
you have to be quick to catch them.
he's right about that.
now that bran's awake will he come live with us?
well, he needs to get his strength back first.
he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard.
he can't be one now, can he? - No.
but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king's council.
or he might raise castles like brandon the builder.
can I be lord of a holdfast?
you will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
no.
that's not me.
hello.
ser alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner.
I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
come stand by the fire.
it's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine.
you're not. You're freezing.
I don't like high places.
you can't fight.
you can't see.
you're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
what are you doing here, sam?
on the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me.
you're almost a man now," he said...
but you're not worthy of my land and title.
tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north.
if you do not," he said...
then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.
or so I'll tell your mother.
nothing would please me more.
ser alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
I'm not going to get any better, you know?
well...
you can't get any worse.
I hear you're reading a boring book.
Pycelle talks too much. - Oh, he never stops.
do you know ser hugh of the vale?
not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon arryn's squire.
he was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
knighted for what?
why are you telling me this?
I promised cat that I'd help you.
where is ser hugh?
I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea.
do you see that boy there?
one of varys's little birds.
the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
now look there.
that one belongs to the queen.
and do you see that septa pretending to read her book?
Varys or the queen?
no, she's one of mine.
is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Yes. - The wiser answer was no, my lord.
get a message to this paragon of yours-Discreetly - send him to question ser hugh.
after that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.
he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel.
Why? - I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
lord baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
...two, three, 24, five, six, 27, 28, 29
ser hugh? - 30, 31, 32
ser hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy.
I'm here on behalf of lord eddard stark, the hand of the king.
I'm the captain of his guard.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, ser...
no "ser." I'm not a knight.
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
Jory: he said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.
he's a knight, you see.
Ah, a knight.
they strut around like roosters down here.
even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
you shouldn't be out here, my lord.
there's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look.
the former hand did call on me, my lord, several times.
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
what did lord arryn want?
he always came to see the boy.
I'd like to see him as well.
as you wish, my lord.
Gendry!
here he is.
strong for his age. He works hard.
show the hand the helmet you made, lad.
this is fine work. - It's not for sale.
boy, this is the king's hand!
if his lordship wants the helm - I made it for me.
forgive him, my lord. - There's nothing to forgive.
when lord arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
he just asked me questions is all, my lord.
what kind of questions?
about my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.
but then he started asking me about my mother.
your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like.
what did you tell him?
she died when I was little.
she had yellow hair.
she'd sing to me sometimes.
look at me.
get back to work, lad.
if the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
find anything?
king robert's bastard son.
this is for the king from lord stark.
should I leave it with
listen.
do you hear them?
how many do you think are in there with him?
guess. - Three?
four.
he likes to do this when I'm on duty
he makes me listen as he insults my sister.
forgive me, my lord - why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
we've met before, you know.
have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
the siege of pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
that's where you got your scar? - Aye.
one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye.
vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed.
they stopped liking it at the end.
that was a proper battle.
d'you remember thoros of myr charging through the breach?
with his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.
I saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell.
it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Theon? He's a good lad.
I doubt it.
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!
let me smell it. Come here.
can I leave this with you?
the message from lord stark.
I don't serve lord stark.
where have you been? - Watch duty.
with sam. - Ah, prince porkchop.
where is he? - He wasn't hungry.
impossible!
that's enough.
we're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
never again, no matter what thorne says.
he's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
you are in love, lord snow.
you girls can do as you please.
but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy, i'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
no one touches sam.
what are you waiting for?
attack him!
you get in there.
hit me.
go on, hit me!
I yield!
yield yield.
I yield.
you think this is funny, do you?
when you're out there beyond the wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?
or a sniveling boy?
you send this whore to give me commands?
I should have sent you back her head!
forgive me, khaleesi. I did as you asked.
hush now. It's all right.
irri, take her and leave us. - Yes, khaleesi.
why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you?
you do not command me. - I wasn't commanding you.
I just wanted to invite you to supper.
what's this? - It's a gift.
I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags?
are you going to dress me now? - Please.
this stinks of manure. All of it.
stop- stop it. - you would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?
next you'll want to braid my hair.
you've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
you do not talk back to me!
you are a horselord's slut.
and now you've woken the dragon
I am a khaleesi of the dothraki!
I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole's town.
I wouldn't doubt it.
don't you think it's a little bit unfair?
making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it?
what, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?
it's absurd. - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
why not?
because I'm fat?
no - but I like girls just as much as you do.
they might not like me as much.
I've never - Been with one.
you've probably had hundreds.
no.
as a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
Yeah. I find that hard to believe.
I came very close once.
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but
you didn't know where to put it?
I know where to put it.
was she...Old and ugly?
young and gorgeous.
a whore named ros.
what color hair?
red. - Oh, I like red hair.
and her, um...Her...
you don't want to know. - That good?
better. - Oh no.
so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect -?
what's my name?
jon snow?
and why is my surname snow?
because...You're a bastard from the north.
I never met my mother.
my father wouldn't even tell me her name.
I don't know if she's living or dead.
I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife...
or a whore.
so I sat there in the brothel as ros took off her clothes.
but I couldn't do it.
because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named snow?
it's not a good life for a child.
So...you didn't know where to put it?
enjoying yourselves?
you look cold, boys.
it is a bit nippy.
a bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors.
it's still summer.
do you boys even remember the last winter?
how long has it been now? What, 10 years?
I remember.
was it uncomfortable at winterfell?
were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
I build my own fires. - That's admirable.
I spent six months out there, beyond the wall during the last winter.
it was supposed to be a two-week mission.
we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch.
so we went out to look for some of his men
capture them, gather some knowledge.
the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men.
harder than you'll ever be.
they know their country better than we do.
they knew there was a storm coming in.
so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
and we got caught in the open.
wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all.
if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.
and all in darkness.
you don't know cold.
neither of you do.
the horses died first.
we didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.
eating the horses was easy.
but later when we started to fall...
that wasn't easy.
we should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?
soft, fat boys like you.
we'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup.
soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment and they will call you men of the night's watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.
you're boys still.
and come the winter you will die...
like flies.
I hit him.
I hit the dragon.
your brother rhaegar was the last dragon.
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
he is still the true king.
do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne?
no.
but the common people are waiting for him.
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
the common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.
they don't care what games the high lords play.
what do you pray for, ser jorah?
home.
I pray for home too.
my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms.
he couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
he'll never take us home.
lover's quarrel?
I'm sorry. Do I...?
Sansa dear, this is lord baelish. He's known
an old friend of the family.
I've known your mother a long long time.
why do they call you littlefinger? - Arya!
don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right.
when I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called the fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
I've been sitting here for days!
start the damn joust before I piss myself!
gods, who is that?
ser gregor clegane. They call him the mountain.
the hound's older brother.
and his opponent? - ser hugh of the vale.
he was jon arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
not what you were expecting?
has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound?
lovely little tale of brotherly love.
the hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.
gregor a few years older
already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.
some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire
Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.
gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.
held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.
there aren't very many people who know that story.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.
no, please don't.
if the hound so much as heard you mention it, i'm afraid all the knights in king's landing would not be able to save you.
my lord, her grace the queen.
your grace. - You're missing your tournament.
putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
I thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us
the ugliness with the wolves.
and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.
though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.
how is sansa?
she likes it here.
she's the only stark who does.
favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
what are you doing here? - I might ask the same of you.
what is it you hope to accomplish?
the king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
you can't change him. You can't help him.
he'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done.
you'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
if that's my job, then so be it.
you're just a soldier, aren't you?
you take your orders and you carry on.
I suppose it makes sense.
your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your grace.
as was i.
seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
and to you.
boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
Ah, good idea, grandfather. I'm starving.
a song while we wait or -?
I'd rather throw myself down a well.
now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading north.
the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
gods.
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up. every room.
my men can sleep in the stable.
as for myself, I don't require a large room.
truly, my lord, we have nothing.
is there nothing I can do...to remedy this?
you can have my room.
now there's a clever man.
you can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
aye, my lord. - My lord of lannister!
might I entertain you while you eat?
I can sing of your father's victory at king's landing!
nothing would more likely ruin my supper.
lady stark!
what an unexpected pleasure.
I was sorry to have missed you at winterfell.
lady stark!
I was still catelyn tully the last time I stayed here.
you, ser, is that the black bat of harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
it is, my lady.
and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father, lord hoster tully of riverrun?
she is.
the red stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun.
my father counts jonas bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
our lord is honored by his trust.
I envy your father all his fine friends, lady stark, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
I know your sigil as well-The twin towers of frey.
how fares your lord, ser?
lord walder is well, my lady.
he has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday.
he plans to take another wife.
this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10.
in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve,
I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to winterfell to await the king's justice.
the little lord's been dreaming again.
we have visitors. - I don't want to see anyone.
Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.
anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
I don't want to go. - Neither do i.
but robb's lord of winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.
Hodor!
Hodor? - Help bran down the hall.
Hodor.
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
any man of the night's watch is welcome at winterfell.
any man of the night's watch, but not i, eh, boy?
I'm not your boy, lannister.
I'm lord of winterfell while my father is away.
then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
so it's true.
Hello, bran.
do you remember anything about what happened?
he has no memory of that day.
curious. - Why are you here?
would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?
my neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, hodor.
do you like to ride, bran? - Yes.
well, I mean I did like to.
the boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it?
with the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf.
my father will rejoice to hear it.
I have a gift for you.
give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.
you must shape the horse to the rider.
start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
will I really be able to ride?
you will.
on horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
you've done my brother a kindness.
the hospitality of winterfell is yours.
spare me your false courtesies, lord stark.
there's a brothel outside your walls.
there I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
couldn't resist some northern ass?
if you like redheads, ask for ros.
come to see me off, greyjoy? Kind of you.
your master doesn't seem to like lannisters.
he's not my master. - No, of course not.
what happened here? Where is lady stark?
why didn't she receive me?
she wasn't feeling well. - She's not in winterfell, is she?
where did she go? - My lady's whereabouts -My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
tell me, how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?
I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in lannisport.
I believe your uncles were responsible?
must have been a pretty sight. - Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
Yes, a great victory for your people.
shame how it all turned out. - We were outnumbered 10 to one
a stupid rebellion then.
I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle.
now here you are, your enemy's squire.
careful, imp. - I've offended you.
forgive me, it's been a rough morning.
anyway, don't despair.
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it.
your next tumble with ros is on me.
I'll try not to wear her out.
left foot forward. Good.
now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
put all your weight behind it.
what in seven hells is that?
Pyp: they'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
tell them your name.
Samwell tarly, of horn hill - I mean, I was of horn hill.
I've come to take the black. - Come to take the black pudding.
well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.
Rast...
see what he can do.
please, no more. - On your feet.
pick up your sword.
hit him till he finds his feet.
it seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south.
now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon!
again, harder.
I yield!
enough!
he yielded.
looks like the bastard's in love.
all right then, lord snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.
you two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.
all you've got to do is get past the bastard.
are you sure you want to do this? - No.
yield yield yield! I yield.
we're done for today.
go clean the armory.
that's all you're good for.
well fought! - Piss off.
did he hurt you?
I've had worse.
you can call me sam... If you want.
my mother calls me sam - it's not going to get any easier, you know?
you're going to have to defend yourself.
why didn't you get up and fight?
I wanted to.
I just couldn't. - Why not?
I'm a coward.
my father always says so. - The wall's no place for cowards.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I just... Wanted to thank you.
a bloody coward.
people saw us talking to him.
now they'll think we're cowards too.
you're too stupid to be a coward.
you're too stupid to be a - Quick now, before summer's over.
C'mere!
Jorah: vaes dothrak - the city of the horselords.
a pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs
best these savages can do. - These are my people now.
you shouldn't call them savages. - I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.
this is my army.
Khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
if my brother was given an army of dothraki, could you conquer the seven kingdoms?
the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
they fear any water their horses can't drink.
but if they did?
king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
and you know these men? - I fought beside them once, long ago. Now ned stark wants my head.
he drove me from my land.
you sold slaves.
Aye.
Why? - I had no money and an expensive wife.
and where is she now? - In another place, with another man.
your grace? - Yes, my dear?
they call you the last dragon...
they do.
you have dragon's blood in your veins?
it's entirely possible.
what happened to the dragons?
I was told that brave men killed them all.
the brave men didn't kill dragons.
the brave men rode them.
rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization his world has ever seen.
the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne, which the usurper is keeping warm for me.
the swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them...
melted together like so many candles.
I have always wanted to see a dragon.
there is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
really. Why dragons?
they can fly.
and wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else...
far away.
and they can kill.
anyone or anything that tries to hurt them
gets burned away to nothing...
...like so many candles.
Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,
I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
I was not locked in. I have seen things.
what have you seen? - I've seen...
a man from asshal with a dagger of real dragonglass.
ve seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
and I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.
so...
have you seen one?
a pirate ship? - A dragon.
no.
no, the last one died many years before I was born.
I'll tell you what I have seen: their skulls.
they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep.
when I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.
when I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.
the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong.
skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
but as you got closer to the iron throne...
they got bigger and bigger and bigger.
there was ghiscar and valryon, vermithrax, essovius-Archonel, meraxes, vhagar...
and balerion the dread...
...whose fire forged the seven kingdoms into one.
what happened to the skulls?
I don't know.
the usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.
scattered to the wind.
that's very sad.
Yes, it is.
what did I buy you for?
to make me sad? - No, your grace.
to, uh, teach your sister.
to teach my sister how to be a better lover?
you think I bought you to make khal drogo happy?
Oh, you pretty little idiot.
go on then. Get on with it.
someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
and one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.
all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince
what if I have a girl?
gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
what if I only have girls?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Jeyne poole's mother had five children - all of them girls.
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
but what if?
well, if you only had girls,
I suppose the throne would pass to prince joffrey's little brother.
and everyone would hate me.
nobody could ever hate you.
Joffrey does. - Nonsense.
why would you say such a thing?
that business with the wolves? Sansa, I've told you a hundred times:
a direwolf is not - Please shut up about it.
do you remember your lessons?
who built the iron throne?
Aegon the conqueror.
and who built the red keep?
Maegor the cruel.
and how many years did it take to build
my grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
they were killed on the orders of king aerys, yes.
the mad king. - Commonly known as the mad king.
why were they killed?
you should be speak to your father about these matters.
I don't want to speak to my father - ever.
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
no, I won't.
it's the hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords.
the king's tournament.
I assure you the hand wants no part of it.
call it what you will, lord stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters.
dreadful. - If you can't keep the king's peace, perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.
I need more men. - Ned: you'll get 50.
lord baelish will see it paid for. - I will?
you found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace.
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left.
thank you, my lord hand, ser.
they will be put to good use.
the sooner this is over, the better.
the realm prospers from such events, my lord.
they give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
now...
if there's nothing else, my lords?
Oh, this heat.
on days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.
until tomorrow, my lord - I've been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn.
lord arryn?
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.
his sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
lord jon often came to me for counsel.
Why?
I have been grand maester for many years.
kings and hands have come to me for advice since
what did jon want the night before he died?
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.
a book?
what book?
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord.
a ponderous tome.
no, I'd like to read it.
the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
harkon umber, first of his name, born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber in the 183rd year after aegon's landing, at the last hearth.
blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
as I said, my lord, a ponderous read.
did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
he did not, my lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Jon's death... - Such a tragedy.
...did he say anything to you during his final hours?
nothing of import, my lord.
Oh - there was one phrase "the seed is strong," I think it was.
the seed is strong? - Mmm.
what does that mean?
the dying mind is a demented mind, lord stark.
for all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
and you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
what else could it be?
poison.
a disturbing thought.
no no no, I don't think it likely.
the hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Yes, women, cravens...
and eunuchs.
did you know that lord varys is a eunuch?
everybody knows that.
yes yes, of course.
how that sort of person found himself on the king's council,
I will never know.
I've taken enough of your time.
no trouble at all, my lord. It's a great honor
thank you.
I'll find my own way out.
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
it's a hard fall down these steps.
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats?
Syrio says. - He says every swordsman should study cats.
they're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
you have to be quick to catch them.
he's right about that.
now that bran's awake will he come live with us?
well, he needs to get his strength back first.
he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard.
he can't be one now, can he? - No.
but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king's council.
or he might raise castles like brandon the builder.
can I be lord of a holdfast?
you will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
no.
that's not me.
hello.
ser alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner.
I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
come stand by the fire.
it's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine.
you're not. You're freezing.
I don't like high places.
you can't fight.
you can't see.
you're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
what are you doing here, sam?
on the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me.
you're almost a man now," he said...
but you're not worthy of my land and title.
tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north.
if you do not," he said...
then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.
or so I'll tell your mother.
nothing would please me more.
ser alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
I'm not going to get any better, you know?
well...
you can't get any worse.
I hear you're reading a boring book.
Pycelle talks too much. - Oh, he never stops.
do you know ser hugh of the vale?
not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon arryn's squire.
he was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
knighted for what?
why are you telling me this?
I promised cat that I'd help you.
where is ser hugh?
I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea.
do you see that boy there?
one of varys's little birds.
the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
now look there.
that one belongs to the queen.
and do you see that septa pretending to read her book?
Varys or the queen?
no, she's one of mine.
is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Yes. - The wiser answer was no, my lord.
get a message to this paragon of yours-Discreetly - send him to question ser hugh.
after that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.
he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel.
Why? - I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
lord baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
...two, three, 24, five, six, 27, 28, 29
ser hugh? - 30, 31, 32
ser hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy.
I'm here on behalf of lord eddard stark, the hand of the king.
I'm the captain of his guard.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, ser...
no "ser." I'm not a knight.
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
Jory: he said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.
he's a knight, you see.
Ah, a knight.
they strut around like roosters down here.
even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
you shouldn't be out here, my lord.
there's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look.
the former hand did call on me, my lord, several times.
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
what did lord arryn want?
he always came to see the boy.
I'd like to see him as well.
as you wish, my lord.
Gendry!
here he is.
strong for his age. He works hard.
show the hand the helmet you made, lad.
this is fine work. - It's not for sale.
boy, this is the king's hand!
if his lordship wants the helm - I made it for me.
forgive him, my lord. - There's nothing to forgive.
when lord arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
he just asked me questions is all, my lord.
what kind of questions?
about my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.
but then he started asking me about my mother.
your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like.
what did you tell him?
she died when I was little.
she had yellow hair.
she'd sing to me sometimes.
look at me.
get back to work, lad.
if the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
find anything?
king robert's bastard son.
this is for the king from lord stark.
should I leave it with
listen.
do you hear them?
how many do you think are in there with him?
guess. - Three?
four.
he likes to do this when I'm on duty
he makes me listen as he insults my sister.
forgive me, my lord - why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
we've met before, you know.
have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
the siege of pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
that's where you got your scar? - Aye.
one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye.
vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed.
they stopped liking it at the end.
that was a proper battle.
d'you remember thoros of myr charging through the breach?
with his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.
I saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell.
it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Theon? He's a good lad.
I doubt it.
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!
let me smell it. Come here.
can I leave this with you?
the message from lord stark.
I don't serve lord stark.
where have you been? - Watch duty.
with sam. - Ah, prince porkchop.
where is he? - He wasn't hungry.
impossible!
that's enough.
we're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
never again, no matter what thorne says.
he's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
you are in love, lord snow.
you girls can do as you please.
but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy, i'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
no one touches sam.
what are you waiting for?
attack him!
you get in there.
hit me.
go on, hit me!
I yield!
yield yield.
I yield.
you think this is funny, do you?
when you're out there beyond the wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?
or a sniveling boy?
you send this whore to give me commands?
I should have sent you back her head!
forgive me, khaleesi. I did as you asked.
hush now. It's all right.
irri, take her and leave us. - Yes, khaleesi.
why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you?
you do not command me. - I wasn't commanding you.
I just wanted to invite you to supper.
what's this? - It's a gift.
I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags?
are you going to dress me now? - Please.
this stinks of manure. All of it.
stop- stop it. - you would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?
next you'll want to braid my hair.
you've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
you do not talk back to me!
you are a horselord's slut.
and now you've woken the dragon
I am a khaleesi of the dothraki!
I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole's town.
I wouldn't doubt it.
don't you think it's a little bit unfair?
making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it?
what, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?
it's absurd. - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
why not?
because I'm fat?
no - but I like girls just as much as you do.
they might not like me as much.
I've never - Been with one.
you've probably had hundreds.
no.
as a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
Yeah. I find that hard to believe.
I came very close once.
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but
you didn't know where to put it?
I know where to put it.
was she...Old and ugly?
young and gorgeous.
a whore named ros.
what color hair?
red. - Oh, I like red hair.
and her, um...Her...
you don't want to know. - That good?
better. - Oh no.
so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect -?
what's my name?
jon snow?
and why is my surname snow?
because...You're a bastard from the north.
I never met my mother.
my father wouldn't even tell me her name.
I don't know if she's living or dead.
I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife...
or a whore.
so I sat there in the brothel as ros took off her clothes.
but I couldn't do it.
because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named snow?
it's not a good life for a child.
So...you didn't know where to put it?
enjoying yourselves?
you look cold, boys.
it is a bit nippy.
a bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors.
it's still summer.
do you boys even remember the last winter?
how long has it been now? What, 10 years?
I remember.
was it uncomfortable at winterfell?
were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
I build my own fires. - That's admirable.
I spent six months out there, beyond the wall during the last winter.
it was supposed to be a two-week mission.
we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch.
so we went out to look for some of his men
capture them, gather some knowledge.
the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men.
harder than you'll ever be.
they know their country better than we do.
they knew there was a storm coming in.
so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
and we got caught in the open.
wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all.
if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.
and all in darkness.
you don't know cold.
neither of you do.
the horses died first.
we didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.
eating the horses was easy.
but later when we started to fall...
that wasn't easy.
we should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?
soft, fat boys like you.
we'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup.
soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment and they will call you men of the night's watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.
you're boys still.
and come the winter you will die...
like flies.
I hit him.
I hit the dragon.
your brother rhaegar was the last dragon.
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
he is still the true king.
do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne?
no.
but the common people are waiting for him.
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
the common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.
they don't care what games the high lords play.
what do you pray for, ser jorah?
home.
I pray for home too.
my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms.
he couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
he'll never take us home.
lover's quarrel?
I'm sorry. Do I...?
Sansa dear, this is lord baelish. He's known
an old friend of the family.
I've known your mother a long long time.
why do they call you littlefinger? - Arya!
don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right.
when I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called the fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
I've been sitting here for days!
start the damn joust before I piss myself!
gods, who is that?
ser gregor clegane. They call him the mountain.
the hound's older brother.
and his opponent? - ser hugh of the vale.
he was jon arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
not what you were expecting?
has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound?
lovely little tale of brotherly love.
the hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.
gregor a few years older
already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.
some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire
Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.
gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.
held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.
there aren't very many people who know that story.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.
no, please don't.
if the hound so much as heard you mention it, i'm afraid all the knights in king's landing would not be able to save you.
my lord, her grace the queen.
your grace. - You're missing your tournament.
putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
I thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us
the ugliness with the wolves.
and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.
though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.
how is sansa?
she likes it here.
she's the only stark who does.
favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
what are you doing here? - I might ask the same of you.
what is it you hope to accomplish?
the king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
you can't change him. You can't help him.
he'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done.
you'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
if that's my job, then so be it.
you're just a soldier, aren't you?
you take your orders and you carry on.
I suppose it makes sense.
your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your grace.
as was i.
seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
and to you.
boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
Ah, good idea, grandfather. I'm starving.
a song while we wait or -?
I'd rather throw myself down a well.
now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading north.
the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
gods.
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up. every room.
my men can sleep in the stable.
as for myself, I don't require a large room.
truly, my lord, we have nothing.
is there nothing I can do...to remedy this?
you can have my room.
now there's a clever man.
you can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
aye, my lord. - My lord of lannister!
might I entertain you while you eat?
I can sing of your father's victory at king's landing!
nothing would more likely ruin my supper.
lady stark!
what an unexpected pleasure.
I was sorry to have missed you at winterfell.
lady stark!
I was still catelyn tully the last time I stayed here.
you, ser, is that the black bat of harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
it is, my lady.
and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father, lord hoster tully of riverrun?
she is.
the red stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun.
my father counts jonas bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
our lord is honored by his trust.
I envy your father all his fine friends, lady stark, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
I know your sigil as well-The twin towers of frey.
how fares your lord, ser?
lord walder is well, my lady.
he has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday.
he plans to take another wife.
this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10.
in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve,
I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to winterfell to await the king's justice.
the little lord's been dreaming again.
we have visitors. - I don't want to see anyone.
Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad.
anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.
I don't want to go. - Neither do i.
but robb's lord of winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.
Hodor!
Hodor? - Help bran down the hall.
Hodor.
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
any man of the night's watch is welcome at winterfell.
any man of the night's watch, but not i, eh, boy?
I'm not your boy, lannister.
I'm lord of winterfell while my father is away.
then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
so it's true.
Hello, bran.
do you remember anything about what happened?
he has no memory of that day.
curious. - Why are you here?
would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?
my neck is beginning to hurt. - Kneel, hodor.
do you like to ride, bran? - Yes.
well, I mean I did like to.
the boy has lost the use of his legs. - What of it?
with the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
I'm not a cripple. - Then I'm not a dwarf.
my father will rejoice to hear it.
I have a gift for you.
give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest.
you must shape the horse to the rider.
start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
will I really be able to ride?
you will.
on horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
you've done my brother a kindness.
the hospitality of winterfell is yours.
spare me your false courtesies, lord stark.
there's a brothel outside your walls.
there I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
couldn't resist some northern ass?
if you like redheads, ask for ros.
come to see me off, greyjoy? Kind of you.
your master doesn't seem to like lannisters.
he's not my master. - No, of course not.
what happened here? Where is lady stark?
why didn't she receive me?
she wasn't feeling well. - She's not in winterfell, is she?
where did she go? - My lady's whereabouts -My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
tell me, how do you think balon greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?
I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in lannisport.
I believe your uncles were responsible?
must have been a pretty sight. - Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
Yes, a great victory for your people.
shame how it all turned out. - We were outnumbered 10 to one
a stupid rebellion then.
I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle.
now here you are, your enemy's squire.
careful, imp. - I've offended you.
forgive me, it's been a rough morning.
anyway, don't despair.
I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it.
your next tumble with ros is on me.
I'll try not to wear her out.
left foot forward. Good.
now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
put all your weight behind it.
what in seven hells is that?
Pyp: they'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
tell them your name.
Samwell tarly, of horn hill - I mean, I was of horn hill.
I've come to take the black. - Come to take the black pudding.
well, you couldn't be any worse than you look.
Rast...
see what he can do.
please, no more. - On your feet.
pick up your sword.
hit him till he finds his feet.
it seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south.
now they send us squealing bloody pigs. - Jon!
again, harder.
I yield!
enough!
he yielded.
looks like the bastard's in love.
all right then, lord snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise.
you two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.
all you've got to do is get past the bastard.
are you sure you want to do this? - No.
yield yield yield! I yield.
we're done for today.
go clean the armory.
that's all you're good for.
well fought! - Piss off.
did he hurt you?
I've had worse.
you can call me sam... If you want.
my mother calls me sam - it's not going to get any easier, you know?
you're going to have to defend yourself.
why didn't you get up and fight?
I wanted to.
I just couldn't. - Why not?
I'm a coward.
my father always says so. - The wall's no place for cowards.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I just... Wanted to thank you.
a bloody coward.
people saw us talking to him.
now they'll think we're cowards too.
you're too stupid to be a coward.
you're too stupid to be a - Quick now, before summer's over.
C'mere!
Jorah: vaes dothrak - the city of the horselords.
a pile of mud. Mud and shit and twigs
best these savages can do. - These are my people now.
you shouldn't call them savages. - I'll call them what I like, because they're my people.
this is my army.
Khal drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
if my brother was given an army of dothraki, could you conquer the seven kingdoms?
the dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
they fear any water their horses can't drink.
but if they did?
king robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
and you know these men? - I fought beside them once, long ago. Now ned stark wants my head.
he drove me from my land.
you sold slaves.
Aye.
Why? - I had no money and an expensive wife.
and where is she now? - In another place, with another man.
your grace? - Yes, my dear?
they call you the last dragon...
they do.
you have dragon's blood in your veins?
it's entirely possible.
what happened to the dragons?
I was told that brave men killed them all.
the brave men didn't kill dragons.
the brave men rode them.
rode them from valyria to build the greatest civilization his world has ever seen.
the breath of the greatest dragon forged the iron throne, which the usurper is keeping warm for me.
the swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them...
melted together like so many candles.
I have always wanted to see a dragon.
there is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
really. Why dragons?
they can fly.
and wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else...
far away.
and they can kill.
anyone or anything that tries to hurt them
gets burned away to nothing...
...like so many candles.
Yes. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
well, after 15 years in a pleasure house,
I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
I was not locked in. I have seen things.
what have you seen? - I've seen...
a man from asshal with a dagger of real dragonglass.
ve seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
and I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk.
so...
have you seen one?
a pirate ship? - A dragon.
no.
no, the last one died many years before I was born.
I'll tell you what I have seen: their skulls.
they used to decorate the throne room in the red keep.
when I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him.
when I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet.
the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong.
skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
but as you got closer to the iron throne...
they got bigger and bigger and bigger.
there was ghiscar and valryon, vermithrax, essovius-Archonel, meraxes, vhagar...
and balerion the dread...
...whose fire forged the seven kingdoms into one.
what happened to the skulls?
I don't know.
the usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.
scattered to the wind.
that's very sad.
Yes, it is.
what did I buy you for?
to make me sad? - No, your grace.
to, uh, teach your sister.
to teach my sister how to be a better lover?
you think I bought you to make khal drogo happy?
Oh, you pretty little idiot.
go on then. Get on with it.
someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
and one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.
all the lords of westeros will gather here to see the little prince
what if I have a girl?
gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
what if I only have girls?
I wouldn't worry about that.
Jeyne poole's mother had five children - all of them girls.
Yes, but it's highly unlikely.
but what if?
well, if you only had girls,
I suppose the throne would pass to prince joffrey's little brother.
and everyone would hate me.
nobody could ever hate you.
Joffrey does. - Nonsense.
why would you say such a thing?
that business with the wolves? Sansa, I've told you a hundred times:
a direwolf is not - Please shut up about it.
do you remember your lessons?
who built the iron throne?
Aegon the conqueror.
and who built the red keep?
Maegor the cruel.
and how many years did it take to build
my grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?
they were killed on the orders of king aerys, yes.
the mad king. - Commonly known as the mad king.
why were they killed?
you should be speak to your father about these matters.
I don't want to speak to my father - ever.
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
no, I won't.
it's the hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my lords.
the king's tournament.
I assure you the hand wants no part of it.
call it what you will, lord stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the street of sisters.
dreadful. - If you can't keep the king's peace, perhaps the city watch should be commanded by someone who can.
I need more men. - Ned: you'll get 50.
lord baelish will see it paid for. - I will?
you found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace.
I'll also give you 20 of my household guard till the crowds have left.
thank you, my lord hand, ser.
they will be put to good use.
the sooner this is over, the better.
the realm prospers from such events, my lord.
they give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
and every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
now...
if there's nothing else, my lords?
Oh, this heat.
on days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.
until tomorrow, my lord - I've been hoping to talk to you about jon arryn.
lord arryn?
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.
his sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
lord jon often came to me for counsel.
Why?
I have been grand maester for many years.
kings and hands have come to me for advice since
what did jon want the night before he died?
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.
a book?
what book?
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord.
a ponderous tome.
no, I'd like to read it.
the lineages and histories of the great houses of the seven kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
harkon umber, first of his name, born to lord hother umber and lady amaryllis umber in the 183rd year after aegon's landing, at the last hearth.
blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
as I said, my lord, a ponderous read.
did jon arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
he did not, my lord. And I did not presume to ask.
Jon's death... - Such a tragedy.
...did he say anything to you during his final hours?
nothing of import, my lord.
Oh - there was one phrase "the seed is strong," I think it was.
the seed is strong? - Mmm.
what does that mean?
the dying mind is a demented mind, lord stark.
for all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
and you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
what else could it be?
poison.
a disturbing thought.
no no no, I don't think it likely.
the hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare
I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
Yes, women, cravens...
and eunuchs.
did you know that lord varys is a eunuch?
everybody knows that.
yes yes, of course.
how that sort of person found himself on the king's council,
I will never know.
I've taken enough of your time.
no trouble at all, my lord. It's a great honor
thank you.
I'll find my own way out.
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
it's a hard fall down these steps.
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats. - Cats?
Syrio says. - He says every swordsman should study cats.
they're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
you have to be quick to catch them.
he's right about that.
now that bran's awake will he come live with us?
well, he needs to get his strength back first.
he wants to be a knight of the kingsguard.
he can't be one now, can he? - No.
but someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king's council.
or he might raise castles like brandon the builder.
can I be lord of a holdfast?
you will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
no.
that's not me.
hello.
ser alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner.
I should warn you, I don't see all that well.
come stand by the fire.
it's warmer. - No, that's all right. I'm fine.
you're not. You're freezing.
I don't like high places.
you can't fight.
you can't see.
you're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
what are you doing here, sam?
on the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me.
you're almost a man now," he said...
but you're not worthy of my land and title.
tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north.
if you do not," he said...
then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die.
or so I'll tell your mother.
nothing would please me more.
ser alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
I'm not going to get any better, you know?
well...
you can't get any worse.
I hear you're reading a boring book.
Pycelle talks too much. - Oh, he never stops.
do you know ser hugh of the vale?
not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire - Jon arryn's squire.
he was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.
knighted for what?
why are you telling me this?
I promised cat that I'd help you.
where is ser hugh?
I'll speak to him. - A singularly bad idea.
do you see that boy there?
one of varys's little birds.
the spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
now look there.
that one belongs to the queen.
and do you see that septa pretending to read her book?
Varys or the queen?
no, she's one of mine.
is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Yes. - The wiser answer was no, my lord.
get a message to this paragon of yours-Discreetly - send him to question ser hugh.
after that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city.
he lives in a large house at the top of the street of steel.
Why? - I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw lord arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.
lord baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
...two, three, 24, five, six, 27, 28, 29
ser hugh? - 30, 31, 32
ser hugh! - As you can see, I'm busy.
I'm here on behalf of lord eddard stark, the hand of the king.
I'm the captain of his guard.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, ser...
no "ser." I'm not a knight.
I see. Well, it just so happens that I am.
Jory: he said he'd be glad to talk to the hand himself.
he's a knight, you see.
Ah, a knight.
they strut around like roosters down here.
even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
you shouldn't be out here, my lord.
there's no telling who has eyes where. - Let them look.
the former hand did call on me, my lord, several times.
I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage.
what did lord arryn want?
he always came to see the boy.
I'd like to see him as well.
as you wish, my lord.
Gendry!
here he is.
strong for his age. He works hard.
show the hand the helmet you made, lad.
this is fine work. - It's not for sale.
boy, this is the king's hand!
if his lordship wants the helm - I made it for me.
forgive him, my lord. - There's nothing to forgive.
when lord arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
he just asked me questions is all, my lord.
what kind of questions?
about my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.
but then he started asking me about my mother.
your mother? - Who she was, what she looked like.
what did you tell him?
she died when I was little.
she had yellow hair.
she'd sing to me sometimes.
look at me.
get back to work, lad.
if the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
find anything?
king robert's bastard son.
this is for the king from lord stark.
should I leave it with
listen.
do you hear them?
how many do you think are in there with him?
guess. - Three?
four.
he likes to do this when I'm on duty
he makes me listen as he insults my sister.
forgive me, my lord - why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
we've met before, you know.
have we? Strange, I've forgotten.
the siege of pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
that's where you got your scar? - Aye.
one of the greyjoys nearly took my eye.
vicious sons of whores. - They like their bloodshed.
they stopped liking it at the end.
that was a proper battle.
d'you remember thoros of myr charging through the breach?
with his burning sword?
I'll remember that till the day I die.
I saw the youngest of the greyjoy lads at winterfell.
it was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Theon? He's a good lad.
I doubt it.
I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam!
let me smell it. Come here.
can I leave this with you?
the message from lord stark.
I don't serve lord stark.
where have you been? - Watch duty.
with sam. - Ah, prince porkchop.
where is he? - He wasn't hungry.
impossible!
that's enough.
we're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
never again, no matter what thorne says.
he's our brother now and we're going to protect him.
you are in love, lord snow.
you girls can do as you please.
but if thorne puts me up against lady piggy, i'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
no one touches sam.
what are you waiting for?
attack him!
you get in there.
hit me.
go on, hit me!
I yield!
yield yield.
I yield.
you think this is funny, do you?
when you're out there beyond the wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?
or a sniveling boy?
you send this whore to give me commands?
I should have sent you back her head!
forgive me, khaleesi. I did as you asked.
hush now. It's all right.
irri, take her and leave us. - Yes, khaleesi.
why did you hit her?! - How many times do I have to tell you?
you do not command me. - I wasn't commanding you.
I just wanted to invite you to supper.
what's this? - It's a gift.
I had it made for you. - Dothraki rags?
are you going to dress me now? - Please.
this stinks of manure. All of it.
stop- stop it. - you would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you?
next you'll want to braid my hair.
you've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
you do not talk back to me!
you are a horselord's slut.
and now you've woken the dragon
I am a khaleesi of the dothraki!
I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
the next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in mole's town.
I wouldn't doubt it.
don't you think it's a little bit unfair?
making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
Sally on the side? - It's silly, isn't it?
what, we can't defend the wall unless we're celibate?
it's absurd. - I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
why not?
because I'm fat?
no - but I like girls just as much as you do.
they might not like me as much.
I've never - Been with one.
you've probably had hundreds.
no.
as a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.
Yeah. I find that hard to believe.
I came very close once.
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but
you didn't know where to put it?
I know where to put it.
was she...Old and ugly?
young and gorgeous.
a whore named ros.
what color hair?
red. - Oh, I like red hair.
and her, um...Her...
you don't want to know. - That good?
better. - Oh no.
so why exactly did you not make love to ros with the perfect -?
what's my name?
jon snow?
and why is my surname snow?
because...You're a bastard from the north.
I never met my mother.
my father wouldn't even tell me her name.
I don't know if she's living or dead.
I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife...
or a whore.
so I sat there in the brothel as ros took off her clothes.
but I couldn't do it.
because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named snow?
it's not a good life for a child.
So...you didn't know where to put it?
enjoying yourselves?
you look cold, boys.
it is a bit nippy.
a bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors.
it's still summer.
do you boys even remember the last winter?
how long has it been now? What, 10 years?
I remember.
was it uncomfortable at winterfell?
were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
I build my own fires. - That's admirable.
I spent six months out there, beyond the wall during the last winter.
it was supposed to be a two-week mission.
we heard a rumor mance rayder was planning to attack eastwatch.
so we went out to look for some of his men
capture them, gather some knowledge.
the wildlings who fight for mance rayder are hard men.
harder than you'll ever be.
they know their country better than we do.
they knew there was a storm coming in.
so they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
and we got caught in the open.
wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all.
if you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.
and all in darkness.
you don't know cold.
neither of you do.
the horses died first.
we didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.
eating the horses was easy.
but later when we started to fall...
that wasn't easy.
we should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we?
soft, fat boys like you.
we'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup.
soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment and they will call you men of the night's watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.
you're boys still.
and come the winter you will die...
like flies.
I hit him.
I hit the dragon.
your brother rhaegar was the last dragon.
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
he is still the true king.
do you want to see your brother sitting on the iron throne?
no.
but the common people are waiting for him.
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
the common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.
they don't care what games the high lords play.
what do you pray for, ser jorah?
home.
I pray for home too.
my brother will never take back the seven kingdoms.
he couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
he'll never take us home.
lover's quarrel?
I'm sorry. Do I...?
Sansa dear, this is lord baelish. He's known
an old friend of the family.
I've known your mother a long long time.
why do they call you littlefinger? - Arya!
don't be rude! - No, it's quite all right.
when I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called the fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.
I've been sitting here for days!
start the damn joust before I piss myself!
gods, who is that?
ser gregor clegane. They call him the mountain.
the hound's older brother.
and his opponent? - ser hugh of the vale.
he was jon arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
yes yes, enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!
not what you were expecting?
has anyone ever told you the story of the mountain and the hound?
lovely little tale of brotherly love.
the hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.
gregor a few years older
already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.
some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
one evening gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire
Gregor's toy, a wooden knight.
gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.
held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.
there aren't very many people who know that story.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.
no, please don't.
if the hound so much as heard you mention it, i'm afraid all the knights in king's landing would not be able to save you.
my lord, her grace the queen.
your grace. - You're missing your tournament.
putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
I thought we might put what happened on the kingsroad behind us
the ugliness with the wolves.
and forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.
though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.
how is sansa?
she likes it here.
she's the only stark who does.
favors her mother, not much of the north in her.
what are you doing here? - I might ask the same of you.
what is it you hope to accomplish?
the king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise.
you can't change him. You can't help him.
he'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done.
you'll try your best to pick up the pieces.
if that's my job, then so be it.
you're just a soldier, aren't you?
you take your orders and you carry on.
I suppose it makes sense.
your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
I was also trained to kill my enemies, your grace.
as was i.
seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
and to you.
boy! Bread, meat and beer. Quickly.
Ah, good idea, grandfather. I'm starving.
a song while we wait or -?
I'd rather throw myself down a well.
now now, grandfather, this may be your last chance if you're heading north.
the only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
gods.
I'm sorry, my lord. We're full up. every room.
my men can sleep in the stable.
as for myself, I don't require a large room.
truly, my lord, we have nothing.
is there nothing I can do...to remedy this?
you can have my room.
now there's a clever man.
you can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.
aye, my lord. - My lord of lannister!
might I entertain you while you eat?
I can sing of your father's victory at king's landing!
nothing would more likely ruin my supper.
lady stark!
what an unexpected pleasure.
I was sorry to have missed you at winterfell.
lady stark!
I was still catelyn tully the last time I stayed here.
you, ser, is that the black bat of harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
it is, my lady.
and is lady whent a true and honest friend to my father, lord hoster tully of riverrun?
she is.
the red stallion was always a welcome sight at riverrun.
my father counts jonas bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
our lord is honored by his trust.
I envy your father all his fine friends, lady stark, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.
I know your sigil as well-The twin towers of frey.
how fares your lord, ser?
lord walder is well, my lady.
he has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday.
he plans to take another wife.
this man came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10.
in the name of king robert and the good lords you serve,
I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to winterfell to await the king's justice.
does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
no.
I stood vigil for him myself last night.
he had no one else.
he'd never worn this armor before.
bad luck for him
going against the Mountain.
who determines the draw?
all the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
Aye.
but who holds the straws?
you've done good work, sisters.
life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the trident.
I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.
as is my wife.
I don't think the widow's life would suit her.
you're too modest.
I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
my father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen.
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
he was a fine man, your father.
what the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
and that lad
he was a squire until a few months ago.
how could he afford a new suit of armor?
perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?
I hear the King wants to joust today.
Yes, that will never happen.
robert tends to do what he wants.
if the King got what he wanted all the time, he'd still be fighting a damned rebellion.
it's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go.
your mother was a dumb whore with a fat ass. Did you know that?
look at this idiot! One ball and no brains.
he can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
you're too fat for your armor.
fat? Fat, is it?
is that how you speak to your King?
that was funny, is it?
no, Your Grace.
no? You don't like the Hand's joke?
you're torturing the poor boy.
you heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor.
go find the breastplate stretcher-- now!
the breastplate stretcher"?
how long before he figures it out?
maybe you should have one invented.
all right, all right.
but you watch me out there-- I still know how to point a Lance.
you have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
why, because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
and who's going to hit you back? - Anybody who can.
and the last man in his saddle-- - Will be you.
there's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
Aye.
drink. - I'm not thirsty.
drink. Your King commands it.
gods, too fat for my armor.
your squire... A Lannister boy?
Mm. A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.
Cersei Lannister will make a good match," she told me.
you'll need her father on your side.
I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted.
enough of this. Let's go watch 'em ride.
at least I can smell someone else's blood.
Robert? - What?
an inspiring sight for the people, eh?
come, bow before your King! Bow, you shits!
Where's Arya? - At her dancing lessons.
the knight of the flowers.
thank you, Ser Loras.
don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Hey. - I can't watch.
100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
I'll take that bet.
now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?
a dozen barrels of Dornish wine?
or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
or you could even buy a friend.
he's going to die.
ser Loras rides well.
such a shame, Littlefinger.
it would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
and tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
quite crafty, really.
ser Loras would never do that.
there's no honor in tricks.
no honor and quite a bit of gold.
sword!
leave him be!
stop this madness in the name of your King!
let him go!
I owe you my life, Ser.
I'm no Ser.
remove his hood.
this isn't the Kingsroad.
you said we were riding for Winterfell.
I did... Often and loudly.
very wise.
they'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place.
word's probably gotten to my father by now.
he'll be offering a handsome reward.
everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.
would you be so good as to untie me?
and why would I do that? - Why not?
am I going to run?
the hill tribes would kill me for my boots.
unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Ah, the eastern road.
we're going to the Vale.
you're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes.
tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?
five years ago.
she's changed.
she was always a bit touched, but now
you might as well kill me here.
I am not a murderer, Lannister. - Neither am I!
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life.
the dagger found-- - What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
should I gag him? - Why?
am I starting to make sense?
my Lady, this way.
untie me.
if I die, what's the point?
I'll be fine, My Lady.
there's no need to bloody yourself.
your first?
you need a woman.
nothing like a woman after a fight.
I'm willing if she is.
the Iron Islands.
？？A Kraken.
？？We do not sow.
lords? - The Greyjoys.
famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
and failed rebellions.
？？A stag
a crowned stag now that Robert's King.
good. - Words: Ours is the fury.
lords: The Baratheons. - Mm-hmm.
the Westerlands.
Sigil: A lion. - Mmm.
？？A Lannister always pays his debts.
no.
a common saying, but not their official motto.
？？The Lannisters.
we're still on their words. - I don't know them.
you do know them. Think.
unbowed, unbent, unbroken.
that's House Martell. - "Righteous in wrath.
house Hornwood. - "Family, duty, honor.
those are Tully words-- your mother's.
are we playing a game? - Family, duty, honor...
is that the right order? - You know it is.
family comes first?
your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
how can she protect the family if she's not with her family?
your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept
and then she left!
when you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother.
I placed you in her arms.
from that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you.
Absolutely.
fiercely. - Why did she leave?
I still can't tell you, - but she will be home soon. - Do you know where she is now?
today?
no, I don't.
then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
I'll never shoot another arrow.
and where is that written?
you need legs to work a bow. - Hmm.
if the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
really
Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old.
why shouldn't you?
shh, keep it down.
you're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
important enough for the likes of you.
you're not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.
jealous?
why should I be jealous?
anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night.
what's a dwarf like down below?
I've always wondered.
might surprise you. - Hmm?
he's good with his fingers too.
and his tongue.
generous tipper.
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
you are jealous.
I'm a Greyjoy.
we've been lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years.
there's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
and what about the Starks?
I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
a ward-- that's a nice word for it.
your father rebelled against King Robert - and if he does it again-- - My father fought for the freedom of his people.
what did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
you're a very serious boy.
I'm not a boy. - Oh yes, you are.
a serious boy with a serious cock.
I don't want to pay for it.
then get yourself a wife.
come on.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
how is your son, My Lord?
he'll never walk again.
but his mind is sound?
so they say.
a blessing then.
I suffered an early mutilation myself.
some doors close forever...
others open in the most unexpected places.
may I?
if the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head.
and who would mourn poor Varys then?
north or South, they sing no songs for spiders.
but there are things you must know.
you are the King's Hand and the King is a fool
your friend, I know, but a fool
and doomed unless you save him.
I've been in the capital a month.
why have you waited so long to tell me this?
I didn't trust you.
so why do you trust me now?
the Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely.
there are few men of honor in the capital.
you are one of them.
I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
what sort of doom does the King face?
the same sort as Jon Arryn.
the tears of Lys, they call it.
a rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water.
it leaves no trace.
who gave it to him?
some dear friend, no doubt. But which one?
there were many.
lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.
there was one boy.
all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
the squire, Ser Hugh?
pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
if Ser Hugh poisoned him
who paid Ser Hugh?
someone who could afford it. Jon was a man of peace.
he was Hand for 17 years
17 good years.
why kill him?
he started asking questions.
he's found one bastard already.
he has the book.
the rest will come.
and when he knows the truth, what will he do?
the gods alone know.
the fools tried to kill his son.
what's worse-- they botched it.
the wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats.
we will be at war soon, my friend. - What good is war now?
we're not ready.
if one Hand can die, why not a second?
this Hand is not the other.
we need time.
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.
you know how these savages are.
Delay," you say. "Move fast," I reply.
this is no longer a game for two players.
it never was.
the first to arrive and the last to leave.
I admire your industry. You do move quietly.
we all have our qualities.
you look a bit lonely today.
you should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.
first boy is on the house. I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
am I?
all those birds that whisper in your ear
such pretty little things.
trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
Oh, I'm sure.
lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion
both equally important.
though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?
all desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
and I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers.
must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.
the logistics alone
to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.
strictly speaking.
tell me-- does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?
I've often wondered.
do you know I have no idea where they are?
and we had been so close.
but enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?
since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
saw me with your own eyes? - Eyes I own.
council business.
we all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.
if the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion...
to think a simple word to the Queen
one shudders at the thought. - Ooh.
but you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
have you? - Yes.
earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
was that you under the bed?
and not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary...
council business?
of course you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.
you're from there yourself, after all.
we're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?
I'd like to think we are.
so you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies.
to stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm
Oh, please. - To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King
what are you two conspiring about?
well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up.
my brother is coming.
to a small council meeting?
disturbing news from far away.
haven't you heard?
off with you. No begging.
I'm not a beggar. I live here.
d'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
I want to see my father.
I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me.
you want your father, boy?
he's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
my father is Hand of the King!
I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes.
now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
you know I had half my guard out searching for you?
you promised me this would stop.
they said they were going to kill you.
who did? - I didn't see them, - but I think one was fat. - Oh, Arya.
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage
something about the savage.
where did you hear this? - In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
what were you doing in the dungeons?
chasing a cat.
pardon, My Lord.
there's a night's watchman here begging a word.
he says it's urgent.
your name, friend? - Yoren, if it please.
this must be your son. He has the look.
I'm a girl!
did Benjen send you?
no one sent me, My Lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
thank you, My Lord.
but that's not why I disturb you now.
your brother Benjen, his blood runs black
makes him as much my brother as yours.
it's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.
there are others riding too.
the whole city will know by tomorrow.
know what?
best said in private, My Lord.
go on. We'll talk more later.
Jory, take her safely to her room.
come along, My Lady. You heard your father.
how many guards does my father have?
here in King's Landing? 50.
you wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?
no fear on that count, little lady.
well? - It's about your wife, My Lord.
she's taken the Imp.
you're far from home, Lady Stark.
to whom do I speak?
ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.
is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
there was no time to send word.
may I ask, My Lady, why he is with you?
that's why there was no time.
he is my prisoner. - He doesn't look like a prisoner.
my sister will decide what he looks like.
Yes, My Lady.
she will at that.
the Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes
I'll impregnate the bitch.
I like you.
lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called.
I need to see the King first-- alone.
the King is at the small council meeting, My Lord.
he has summoned you.
is it about my wife? - No, My Lord.
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
the whore is pregnant.
you're speaking of murdering a child. - I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.
well, hear it now.
I want 'em dead, mother and child both.
and that fool Viserys as well.
is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.
you will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
honor?!
I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule!
one King, Seven Kingdoms.
do you think honor keeps them in line?
do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace?
it's fear-- fear and blood.
then we're no better than the Mad King.
careful, Ned. Careful now.
you want to assassinate a girl because the Spider heard a rumor?
no rumor, My Lord. The princess is with child.
based on whose information?
ser Jorah Mormont.
he is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor.
small difference, I know, to an honorable man.
he broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.
we commit murder on the word of this man?
and if he's right?
if she has a son?
a Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army...
what then? - The Narrow Sea still lies between us.
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
do nothing?
that's your wise advice?
do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?
you're my council. Counsel!
speak sense to this honorable fool.
I understand your misgivings, My Lord.
truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing.
yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm.
should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die?
how many towns will burn?
is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now
when you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with.
cut her throat. Be done with it.
I followed you into war
twice, without doubts, without second thoughts.
but I will not follow you now.
the Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
she dies.
I will have no part in it.
you're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.
you'll do as I command or I'll find me a hand who will.
and good luck to him.
I thought you were a better man.
out. Out, damn you.
I'm done with you.
go, run back to Winterfell!
I'll have your head on a spike!
I'll put it there myself, you fool!
you think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable?
this is a war!
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
get them ready. Do it yourself.
don't ask anyone for help. - Right away, My Lord.
lord Baelish is here for you.
his Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave.
the word "treason" was mentioned.
what can I do for you?
when do you return to Winterfell?
Why? What do you care?
if you're still here come nightfall,
I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.
if that sort of thing still interests you.
I don't have the time.
it won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers.
who are your best two swords? - Heward and Wyl.
find them and meet me at the stables.
you bring him here without permission?
you pollute my home with his presence?
your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing.
you remember her, don't you?
isn't he beautiful?
and strong too. Jon knew it.
his last words were "the seed is strong.
he wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.
look at him, the Lord of all the Vale.
you wrote me about the Lannisters, - warning me-- - To stay away from them!
not to bring one here!
mommy?
is that the bad man? - It is.
he's little.
he's Tyrion the imp of house Lannister.
he killed your father.
he murdered the Hand of the King!
Oh, did I kill him too?
I've been a very busy man.
you will watch your tongue!
these men are knights of the Vale.
every one of them loved Jon Arryn.
every one of them would die for me.
if any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do.
you can't hurt us.
no one can hurt us here. Tell him, mommy!
tell him! - Shh shh shh, my sweet boy.
he's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.
no one will hurt my baby.
mommy...
I want to see the bad man fly.
perhaps you will, my little love.
this man is my prisoner.
I will not have him harmed.
ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary.
take him down below so he can rest.
introduce him to Mord.
you go sleep, dwarf man.
sleep good, little dwarf man!
lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything.
he adores the man.
you're jealous.
are you sure this won't hurt?
only if I slip.
and you'd prefer me like this? - Mm-hmm.
if you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
I want you.
my brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man.
he treats me as if I'm a spoiled child.
Oh, and you're not?
Loras Tyrell, the knight of the flowers?
how many wars have you fought in?
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?
hold still.
all I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood
you did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the melee.
his eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
he shouldn't have entered the melee if he didn't know how to fight.
easy for you to say.
not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
it's not a gift. No one gave it to me.
I'm good because I work at it
every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you.
yes well, I guess we'll never know.
everywhere? - Everywhere.
so how did it end up?
the Targaryen girl will die?
it needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.
Robert's rather tasteless about it.
every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
it's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
he does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.
you have to give it to the Lannisters-- they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
I have an outrageous amount of money.
not as much as the Lannisters. But a lot more than you.
Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him.
last time we were out there for two weeks.
tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something's flesh.
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.
and he's the King. - Hmm.
how did that ever happen? - Because he loves his killing.
and he used to be good at it.
do you know who should be king?
be serious. - I am.
my father could be your bank.
I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you.
I'm fourth in line.
and where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight. - Stannis?
Stannis has the personality of a lobster. He's still my older brother.
what are you doing?! - Look at it.
you cut me. It's just blood. We've all got it in us.
sometimes a little spills.
if you become King, you're going to see a lot of this.
you need to get used to it.
go on. Look.
people love you.
they love to serve you because you're kind to them.
they want to be near you.
you're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it.
you don't love killing.
where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst?
that thrones are only made for the hated and the feared?
you would be a wonderful King.
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out.
you seemed so good together.
I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
no.
he's not serious enough.
I'll say this for Ned Stark: He's serious enough.
was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
I don't know.
but I do know this:
if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea...
we won't be able to stop them.
the Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that.
they don't have discipline. They don't have armor.
they don't have siege weapons.
it's a neat little trick you do:
you move your lips and your father's voice comes out.
is my father wrong?
let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with 40, 000 Dothraki screamers at his back.
we hole up in our castles
a wise move-- only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.
they leave us in our castles.
they go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.
how long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls?
when do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all?
we still outnumber them.
which is the bigger number: Five or one?
five.
five...
one.
one army-- a real army united behind one leader with one purpose.
our purpose died with the Mad King.
now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse.
and everybody wants something different.
your father wants to own the world.
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
what do you want?
we haven't had a real fight in nine years.
back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight.
and that's all the realm is now:
back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing.
sometimes I don't know what holds it together.
our marriage.
Ah, so here we sit 17 years later, holding it all together.
don't you get tired? Every day.
how long can hate hold a thing together?
well, 17 years is quite a long time.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
what was she like?
you've never asked about her, not once.
why not?
at first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her.
I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you.
when I realized that wasn't going to happen,
I refused to ask out of spite.
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.
and eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you.
as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
so why now?
what harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
you want to know the horrible truth?
I can't even remember what she looked like.
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted...
someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.
I felt something for you once, you know?
I know.
even after we lost our first boy.
for quite a while, actually.
was it ever possible for us?
was there ever a time, ever a moment?
no.
does that make you feel better or worse?
it doesn't make me feel anything.
she looks like him, don't she, My Lord?
she has his nose, his black hair.
Aye.
tell him when you see him, My Lord.
if it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.
I will.
and tell him I've been with no one else.
I swear it, My Lord, by the old gods and new.
I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him.
the King was always good to me.
when Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
he wasn't that sort of man, My Lord.
he just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
he looks healthy enough to me.
the girl shall want for nothing.
brothels make a much better investment than ships,
I've found.
whores rarely sink.
what do you know of King Robert's bastards?
well, he has more than you, for a start.
how many? - Does it matter?
if you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
and Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
he was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.
he was overcome with fatherly love.
come.
Jory! - My Lord.
such a small pack of wolves.
stay back, Ser. This is the Hand of the King.
was the Hand of the King.
now I'm not sure what he is
lord of somewhere very far away.
what's the meaning of this, Lannister?
get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.
you remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark?
blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
I remember him well.
it seems he had some trouble on the road.
you wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?
he was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
my lords!
I'll bring the city watch.
come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.
if you threaten My Lord again-- - Threaten?
as in, "I'm going to open your lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of"?
you kill me, your brother's a dead man.
you're right.
take him alive. Kill his men.
my brother, Lord Stark
we want him back.
your pardon, Your Grace.
I would rise, but...
do you know what your wife has done?
she did nothing I did not command.
who'd have thought she had it in her?
by what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
I am the King's Hand, charged with keeping the peace... - You were the King's Hand
you shall now be held accountable.
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?!
Catelyn will release Tyrion and you'll make your peace with Jaime.
he butchered my men
lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
quiet, woman. - Jaime has fled the city.
give me leave to bring him back to justice.
I took you for a King. - Hold your tongue.
he's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
I should wear the armor and you the gown.
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
wear it in silence or I'll honor you again.
see what she does to me?
my loving wife.
I should not have hit her.
that was not...
that was not Kingly.
if we don't act, there will be a war.
so tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.
she's had her fun, now put an end to it.
you hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it.
and what about Jaime Lannister?
what about Jaime? - I'm half a Kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
I don't know what happened between you and those yellow-haired shits.
I don't want to know. This is what matters
I can't rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other's throats.
so enough.
as you command, Your Grace.
with your leave,
I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
piss on that. Send a raven. I want you to stay.
I'm the King. I get what I want.
I never loved my brothers.
a sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.
you were the brother I chose.
we'll talk when I return from the hunt.
the hunt?
killing things clears my head.
you'll have to sit on the throne while I'm away.
you'll hate it more than I do. The Targaryen girl seven hells, don't start with her again.
the girl will die and I'll hear no more of it.
put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again,
I swear to the mother I'll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
Khaleesi?
Oh, Khaleesi!
you're hurt.
not too fast. - Come on, Dancer.
when are you gonna tell him?
not now.
blood for blood. - Come on!
you need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
you're talking about war. - I'm talking about justice.
only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
a Lannister put his spear through your father's leg.
the Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him
you want me to march on Casterly Rock?
you're not a boy anymore. - Come on.
they attacked your father. They've already started the war.
it's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
and it's not your duty, because it's not your House.
Where's Bran?
I don't know. It's not my House.
Robb?
all alone in the deep, dark woods.
I'm not alone. My brother is with me.
I don't see him.
got him hidden under your cloak?
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.
silver. - We'll take the pin and the horse.
get down.
be quick about it. - I can't.
the saddle-- the straps.
what's wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
if you don't let me be, I'll have you all killed!
cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
the boy's worth nothing dead.
Benjen Stark's own blood?
think what Mance would give us.
piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.
we're going as far South as South goes.
there ain't no White Walkers down in Dorne.
drop the knife!
let him go and I'll let you live.
Robb.
Robb. - Shut up. Drop the blade!
no, don't. - Do it.
are you all right?
Yes. It doesn't hurt.
tough little lad.
in the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy.
well done.
have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
he would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
you don't have the right - To what, to save your brother's life?
it was the only thing to do, so I did it.
what about her?
give me my life, My Lord, and I'm yours.
we'll keep her alive.
Mord!
Turnkey! Mord!
Mord!
dwarf man making noise!
how would you like to be rich?
dwarf man still making noise.
my family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold.
I'm prepared to give you lots of gold in
no gold!
well, I don't have it here. - No gold.
fuck off.
I don't want to practice today.
no?
they killed Jory.
my father is hurt.
I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
you are troubled. - Yes.
good! Trouble is the perfect time for training.
when you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
I don't like dolls and k
you're not here.
you're with your trouble.
if you are with your trouble when fighting happens
more trouble for you.
just so.
how can you be quick as a snake...
...or as quiet as a shadow...
...when you are somewhere else?
you are fearing for your father, hmm?
that is right.
do you pray to the gods? - The old and the new.
there is only one God and his name is Death.
and there is only one thing we say to Death:
not today.
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
\Khalakka Dothrae! - Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj! - Khalakka Dothrae!
she has to eat the whole heart?
I hope that wasn't my horse.
she's doing well.
she'll never keep it down.
Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!
Khalakka Dothrae!
Khalakka Dothrae!
tell me what she's saying.
the prince is riding.
I have heard the thunder of his hooves.
swift as the wind he rides.
his enemies will cower before him...
and their wives will weep tears of blood.
she's going to have a boy.
he won't be a real Targaryen.
he won't be a true Dragon.
the stallion who mounts the world.
the stallion is the Khal of Khals.
he shall unite the people into a single Khalasar.
all the people of the world will be his herd.
a Prince rides inside me!
and he shall be called Rhaego!
Rhaego! Rhaego!
Rhaego! Rhaego!
Rhaego! Rhaego...
they love her.
Rhaego! Rhaego!
Rhaego! Rhaego...
she truly is a queen today.
don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.
you know the law.
it's not my law.
they don't belong to you.
whatever is hers is also mine.
once, perhaps.
if I sell one egg, I'll have enough to buy a ship.
two eggs-- a ship and an army.
and you have all three. - I need a large army.
I'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.
the greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.
never.
not a piece of it.
how can I carry what I need to carry without it?
who can rule without wealth or fear or love?
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor.
you don't think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?
don't think I know what you want?
I don't care. You can have her.
she can be Queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.
but let me go.
you can go. You can't have the eggs.
you swore an oath to me.
does loyalty mean nothing to you?
it means everything to me.
and yet here you stand.
and yet here I stand.
Mord!
Mord!
Mord!
Mord!
mord.
noise again!
about the gold... - No gold!
no gold. - Listen to me! Listen to me.
sometimes possession is an abstract concept
when they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
where?
where? I don't know where, but when they free me
you want free?
go be free.
have you ever heard the phrase "rich as a Lannister"?
of course you have! You're a smart man.
you know who the Lannisters are.
I am a Lannister.
Tyrion, son of Tywin!
and of course, you have also heard the phrase, "a Lannister always pays his debts.
if you deliver a message from me...
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.
I will owe you gold.
if you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.
what message?
tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
you wish to confess your crimes?
Yes, My Lady. I do, My Lady.
the sky cells always break them.
speak, Imp.
meet your gods as an honest man.
where do I begin, my lords and ladies?
I'm a vile man, I confess it.
my crimes and sins are beyond counting.
I have lied and cheated...
gambled and whored.
I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me.
you want specifics, I suppose.
when I was seven I saw a servant girl bathing in the river.
I stole her robe.
she was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears.
if I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing.
when I was 10 I stuffed my Uncle's boots with goatshit.
when confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire.
poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice.
when I was 12 I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.
I flogged the one-eyed snake.
I skinned my sausage.
I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did.
once I brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel - Silence! - What happened next?
what do you think you're doing?
confessing my crimes.
lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband
lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Oh, I'm very sorry.
I don't know anything about all that.
you've had your little joke.
I trust you enjoyed it.
Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.
is this how justice is done in the Vale?
you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve?
where is the King's Justice?
I am accused and demand a trial!
if you're tried and found guilty, then by the King's own laws you will pay with your life.
I understand the law.
we have no executioner in the Eyrie.
life is more elegant here.
open the moon door.
you want a trial, My Lord Lannister.
very well.
my son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment.
then you will leave...
by one door or the other.
no need to bother Lord Robin.
I demand a trial by combat.
you have that right.
my Lady, I beg the honor.
let me be your champion.
the honor should be mine.
for the love I bore your Lord husband, let me avenge his death.
I'll fight for you, My Lady. - It'll be my honor.
the honor should be mine. - Make the bad man fly!
ser Vardis...
you're quiet.
don't you want to avenge my husband?
with all my heart, My Lady.
but the Imp is half my size.
it would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
agreed.
you demanded a trial by combat.
now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.
my Lady, I will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.
I wouldn't be too glad, Ser.
I name my brother Jaime Lannister.
the Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
send a raven for him. I'm happy to wait.
the trial will be today.
do I have a volunteer?
anyone?
anyone?
I think we can assume that no one is willing
I'll stand for the dwarf.
more wine, Your Grace?
what was I saying? - Simpler time.
it was! It was. You're too young to remember.
wasn't it simpler, Selmy?
it was, Your Grace. - The enemy was right in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.
nothing like today.
it sounds exhilarating. - Exhilarating, yes.
not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw.
you ever fuck a Riverlands girl?
once. I think.
you think? I think you'd remember.
we used to call it "making the eight." - Those were some lucky girls.
you ever make the eight, Barristan?
I don't believe so, Your Grace.
those were the days. - Which days, exactly?
the ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?
or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?
or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
easy, boy.
you might be my brother, but you're speaking to the King.
I suppose it was all rather heroic...
if you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
more wine, Your Grace?
they burned most everything in the Riverlands:
our fields; Our granaries;
our homes.
they took our women, then they took 'em again.
when they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals.
they covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire.
brigands, most likely.
they weren't thieves. They didn't steal nothing.
they even left something behind, Your Grace.
it's the King's Hand you're addressing, not the King.
the King is hunting.
fish. The Sigil of House Tully.
isn't that your wife's house-- Tully, My Lord Hand?
these men, were they flying a Sigil?
a banner? - None, your--Hand.
the one who was leading them...
taller by a foot than any man I've ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
that sounds like someone we know.
the Mountain.
you're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?
the man is an anointed knight.
I've heard him called Tywin Lannister's mad dog.
I'm sure you have as well.
can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
if the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the King's protection, it would be
that would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
well...
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our King, Robert.
lord Beric Dondarrion.
you shall have the command.
assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.
as you command.
in the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name,
king of the Andals and the first men,
lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm,
I charge you to bring the King's Justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes.
I denounce him and attaint him.
I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.
my Lord...This-- this is a drastic action.
it would be better to wait for King Robert's return.
grand Maester Pycelle. - My Lord.
send a raven to Casterly Rock.
inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.
he will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm.
a bold move, My Lord, and admirable.
but is it wise to yank the lion's tail?
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.
gold wins wars, not soldiers.
then how come Robert is King and not Tywin Lannister?
hold!
attack attack! - Come on, Ser Vardis!
attack!
stand and fight, coward!
Yes!
enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.
what are you doing? Get up!
get up, get up, get up!
raise your sword. Raise it!
get up, man!
on your feet! - Get up!
get up and fight, Ser Vardis!
No! Have mercy!
is it over?
you don't fight with honor!
no.
he did.
can I make the little man fly now?
not this little man. This little man is going home.
I believe you have something of mine.
a Lannister always pays his debts.
you wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
well, why shouldn't I? We're in the South.
it's important to remember where you come from.
I'm not sure your mother would like these new styles.
my mother isn't from the North.
I'm aware of that.
why do you care?
do you even have hair under there?
Yes. I have hair. - I've never seen it.
would you like to?
no.
where are you from anyway? The North or the South?
I come from a very small village in - Oh, wait.
I just realized I don't care.
Sansa-- - Septa.
now you are being rude.
my prince.
my prince.
my Lady.
I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks.
with your permission?
it's beautiful, like the one your mother wears.
you'll be queen someday.
it's only fitting you should look the part.
will you forgive me for my rudeness?
there's nothing to forgive.
you're My Lady.
one day we'll be married in the throne room.
lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the Salt Shore in the South, and you will be Queen over all of them.
I'll never disrespect you again.
I'll never be cruel to you again.
do you understand me?
you're My Lady now, from this day until my last day.
stop.
stop!
what are you doing? - Going to King's Landing.
in a turnip cart?
I'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
and you can afford that?
some of my friends are more generous than others.
there's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
so I'll have lots of company.
Yes, you'll be very popular...
until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
and what will happen to me if I stay here?
will I become Lady Greyjoy, - mistress of the Iron Islands? - Don't be a fool.
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King's Landing.
every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back.
there's nothing left for me here.
let's go, Stefon.
let me see it one more time!
see what?
I'm going to miss you.
I know.
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
What?! - Listen
what about Joffrey? - Are you dying because of your leg?
is that why you're sending us home?
what? No. - Please, father. Please don't.
you can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio.
I'm finally getting good.
this isn't a punishment.
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
can we take Syrio back with us?
who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go.
I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I'm meant to be his Queen and have his babies.
seven hells. - When you're old enough,
I'll make you a match with someone who's worthy of you, someone who's brave and gentle and strong
I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him!
he'll be the greatest King that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
the lion'sot s Sigil, idiot.
he's a stag, like his father.
he is not. He's nothing like that old drunk King.
go on, girls. Get your Septa and start packing your things.
wait! - Come on.
but it's not fair!

I'm here for the feast.
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

that is no place for a King.
you are no King.

Viserys, please.
there she is.
put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
they can't kill us.
they can't shed blood in their sacred city.
but I can.
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.
he bought you. But he never paid for you.
tell him I want what was bargained for or I'm taking you back.
he can keep the baby.
I'll cut it out and leave it for him.
what's he saying?
he says yes.
you shall have a golden crown...
that men shall tremble to behold.
that was all I wanted.
what-what was promised.
No! No! You cannot touch me.
I am the Dragon. I am the Dragon!
I want my crown! Ahh!
look away, Khaleesi. - No.
no, dany.
Dany, tell them.
make them!
Dany, make them...
no, you can't!
just-- please!
Dany, please!
a crown for a King.
Khaleesi?
he was no Dragon.
fire cannot kill a Dragon.
he's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
tell your wife to return that little shit of an imp to King's Landing.
what about Jaime Lannister?
I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
we'll talk when I return from the hunt.
the hunt?
you'll have to sit on the Throne while I'm away.
you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed.
I demand a trial by combat.
you have that right. - Do I have a volunteer?
I'll stand for the dwarf.
grand Maester Pycelle.
send a raven to Casterly Rock.
inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of Gregor Clegane or be branded an enemy of the Crown and a traitor to the realm.
fight!
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
what? I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
he'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion.

I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.
no, Dany, please! - A crown for a king.
the crimes of your bannerman gregor clegane, the mountain..."
Uh,"arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown.
poor ned stark...
brave man, terrible judgment.
attacking him was stupid.
Lannisters don't act like fools.
are you gonna say something clever?
go on, say something clever.
Catelyn stark took my brother.
why is he still alive?
Tyrion?
Ned stark.
one of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
why is he still alive?
it wouldn't have been clean.
clean.
you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
that's what you want people to think of you.
it's the truth.
when you hear them whispering "kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
of course it bothers me.
the lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
I'm giving you half of our forces - 30, 000 men.
you will bring them to catelyn stark's girlhood home and remind her that lannisters pay their debts.
I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
he's a lannister.
he might be the lowest of the lannisters, but he's one of us.
and every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
so the lion does concern himself with the opinions of...
no, it's not an opinion. It's a fact.
if another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared.
your mother's dead.
before long I'll be dead.
and you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
all of us dead; all of us rotting in the ground.
it's the family name that lives on.
it's all that lives on.
not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
do you understand?
you're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
you are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.
and you are still blessed with youth.
and what have you done with these blessings, huh?
you've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk.
the future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
or we could collapse into nothing, as the targaryens did.
I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
not next year. Not tomorrow.
now.
you're in pain.
I've had worse, my lady.
perhaps it's time to go home.
the south doesn't seem to agree with you.
I know the truth jon arryn died for.
do you, lord stark?
is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
has he done this before?
Jaime would have killed him.
my brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
your brother...
or your lover?
the targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
we shared a womb.
we came into this world together. We belong together.
my son saw you with him.
do you love your children?
with all my heart. - No more than I love mine.
and they are all jaime's. - Thank the gods.
in the rare event that robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
in the morning, he doesn't remember. - You've always hated him.
hated him?
I worshipped him.
every girl in the seven kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
and when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the sept of baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do, and whispered in my ear,"Lyanna."
your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
when the king returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
you must be gone by then, you and your children.
I will not have their blood on my hands.
go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
because wherever you go, robert's wrath will follow you.
and what of my wrath, lord stark?
you should have taken the realm for yourself.
Jaime told me about the day king's landing fell.
he was sitting in the iron throne and you made him give it up.
all you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
such a sad mistake.
I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
Oh, but it was.
when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.
there is no middle ground.
come here.
Oh yes, oh.
Oh yes yes yes.
no no no no!
is that what they teach you up in the north?
and you - Wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
Yes, my lord.
let's start over, shall we?
you be the man and you be the woman.
well, go ahead.
slowly.
you're not fooling them.
they just paid you.
they know what you are.
they know it's all just an act.
your job is to make them forget what they know.
that takes time.
you need to... ease into it.
go ahead.
ease into it.
he's winning you over in spite of yourself.
you're starting to like this.
he wants to believe you.
he's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.
why shouldn't you?
he knows he's better than other men.
he's always known it deep down inside.
now he has proof.
he's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.
why don't you join us, my lord?
I'm saving myself for another.
what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
a stupid saying.
what we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
she must be very beautiful.
no, not really.
impeccable bloodlines though.
I do believe my lord's in love.
for many years.
most of my life really.
play with her ass.
and she loved me too.
I was her little confidant, her plaything.
she could tell me anything, anything at all.
she told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry:
a northerner with a jaw like an anvil.
so I challenged him to a duel.
I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.
the little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
in the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.
"he's just a boy," she said."Please don't hurt him."
so he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by - and off they went.
is she still married to him?
Oh no.
he got himself killed before the wedding...
and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
she loves him, i'm afraid.
and why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? he's just so...
good.
do you know what I learned, losing that duel?
I learned that i'll never win, not that way.
that's their game, their rules.
I'm not going to fight them.
I'm going to fuck them.
that's what I know.
that's what I am.
and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
and what do you want?
Oh, everything, my dear.
everything there is.
now wash yourselves.
both of you are working tonight.
you're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.
where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord?
at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.
the sea would come in closer and closer.
you'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.
where is it you come from?
the iron islands.
they far away?
you've never heard of the iron islands?
trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
trust me, my lord.
you're not living in the wilderness anymore.
in civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
and what's that?
Lord.
Why?
what do you mean why?
my father is balon greyjoy, lord of the iron islands.
what's that got to do with you?
if your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
I will be lord after my father - so you're not lord now?
no, you
are you having a go at me?
is that it?
I just don't understand how you southerners do things.
I'm not a southerner.
you're from south of the wall.
that makes you a southerner to me.
you're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
couldn't say, my lord.
don't know what "impunent" means.
impudent.
it means rude, disrespectful.
do you want to lose that chain?
Theon greyjoy!
the lady is our guest.
I thought she was our prisoner.
are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
I'm used to worse than him.
I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
why did you come here?
didn't mean to come here.
meant to get much further south than this.
as far south as south goes, before the long night comes.
Why?
what are you afraid of?
there's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
owls and shadowcats and - I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.
the "things" you speak of, they've been gone for thousands of years.
they wasn't gone, old man.
they was sleeping.
and they ain't sleeping no more.
I miss girls.
not even talking to them. I never talked to them.
just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
don't you miss girls?
riders.
the horn.
we have to blow the horn.
why is he alone?
one blast for a ranger returning, - two for wildlings, three for- - There's no rider.
whoa, boy, whoa.
that's my uncle benjen's horse.
Where's my uncle?
Ned!
it's robert.
we were hunting- A boar...
I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
I was never meant to be a father.
go on.
you don't want to see this.
my fault.
too much wine, missed my thrust.
it stinks.
it stinks like death.
don't think I can't smell it.
I paid the bastard back, ned.
I drove my knife right through his brain.
you ask them if I didn't. Ask them!
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the kingdoms ever saw.
and I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to ned.
Robert, my sweet- - Out, all of you!
you damned fool.
paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
in the name of robert of the house baratheon, first of...
you know how it goes.
fill in the damn titles.
I hereby command eddard of house stark
titles, titles - "to serve as lord regent and protector of the realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son joffrey comes of age.
give it over.
give it to the council after I'm dead.
at least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
you'll rule now.
you'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.
the girl - Daenerys.
you were right.
Varys, littlefinger, my brother... Worthless.
no one to tell me "no" but you.
only you.
let her live.
stop it, if it's not too late.
I will.
and my son...
help him, ned.
make him better than me.
I'll... I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
my memory.
king robert baratheon, murdered by a pig.
give me something for the pain and let me die.
give him milk of the poppy.
he was reeling from the wine.
he commanded us to step aside, but...
I failed him.
no man could have protected him from himself.
I wonder, ser barristan, who gave the king this wine?
his squire, from the king's own skin.
his squire?
the lannister boy?
such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace did not lack refreshment.
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
his grace has had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen.
whatever arrangements you made, unmake them.
at once.
I'm afraid those birds have flown.
the girl is likely dead already.
throne. - Throne.
can't you help me make him understand?
the dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
have patience, khaleesi.
we will go home, I promise you.
my brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms.
have I said something funny, ser?
forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor aegon the conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
he had no right to them.
he seized them because he could.
and because he had dragons.
ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
you don't believe it.
have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?
I believe what my eyes and ears report.
as for the rest... It was 300 years ago.
who knows what really happened?
now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me.
I'll come with you. - No no, don't trouble yourself.
enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.
psst, jorah the andal.
the spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
a royal pardon - You can go home now.
my son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
just a taste.
my lady, you are from westeros.
you have the honor of addressing daenerys of the house targaryen, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the seven kingdoms.
princess. - Rise.
I'd still like to taste that wine.
that?
Dornish swill.
not worthy of a princess.
I have a dry red from the arbor - Nectar of the gods.
let me give you a cask.
uh- a gift. - You honor me, ser.
the honor - The honor is all mine.
there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Rakharo.
is something wrong? - I have a thirst.
open it.
the wine is for the khaleesi.
it's not for the likes of you.
open it.
pour.
it would be a crime to drink a wine this rich - without at least giving it time to breathe.
do as he says.
as the princess commands.
sweet, isn't it?
can you smell the fruit, ser?
taste it, my lord.
tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
you first.
me?
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
you will drink.
Khaleesi! - Stop him!
come.
you came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
you came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.
you came to us rich and you came to us poor.
some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
it does not matter.
all that is in the past.
here, on the wall, we are all one house.
tonight...
you're allowed to look happy.
you're going to be a ranger.
isn't that what you always wanted?
I want to find my uncle.
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.
I wish I could help you, but I'm no ranger.
it's the steward's life for me.
there's honor in being a steward.
not much, really.
but there's food.
here you begin anew.
a man of the night's watch...lives his life for the realm.
not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house;
not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love;
but for the realm and all the people in it.
you've all learned the words of the vow.
think carefully before you say them.
the penalty for desertion is death.
you can take your vows here tonight at sunset.
do any of you still keep the old gods?
I do, my lord.
you'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did.
Yes, my lord.
you'll find a weirwood a mile north of the wall.
and your old gods too, maybe.
my lord, might I go as well?
does house tarly keep the old gods?
no, my lord.
I was named in the light of the seven, as my father was and his father before him.
why would you forsake the gods of your father and your house?
the night's watch is my house now.
the seven have never answered my prayers.
perhaps the old gods will.
as you wish, lad.
you've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
halder to the builders.
pyp to the stewards.
toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.
Samwell to the stewards.
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.
Balian to the rangers.
Rast to the rangers.
jon to the stewards.
Rancer to the builders.
Echiel to the builders.
gordo to the stewards.
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.
Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables.
mink to the kitchens.
allo to the builders.
Nelugo to the rangers.
may all the gods preserve you.
Rangers with me.
builders!
samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
Pyp, you will report to bowen marsh in the kitchens.
Luke, report to one-eyed joe in the stables.
Dareon, we are sending you to eastwatch.
present yourself to borcas when you arrive.
make no comment about his nose.
jon snow, lord commander mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
will I serve the lord commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath?
certainly.
and keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the lord commander requires of you.
do you take me for a servant?
we took you for a man of the night's watch.
but perhaps we were wrong in that.
may I go?
as you wish.
Jon, wait!
don't you see what they're doing?
I see ser alliser's revenge, that's all.
he wanted it and he got it.
stewards are nothing but maids!
I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!
it's not fair.
fair?
I was singing for a high lord at acorn hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
so now I'm here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.
I'll never see my family again.
I'll never be inside a woman again.
so don't tell me about fair.
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
you think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
could you sing me a song, pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.
now listen to me.
the old man is the lord commander of the night's watch.
you'll be with him day and night.
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.
but you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
you'll know everything, be part of everything.
and he asked for you himself.
he wants to groom you for command.
I just...
I always wanted to be a ranger.
I always wanted to be a wizard.
what?
no, I'm serious.
so you'll stay and say your words with me?
lord stark, a moment.
alone if you will.
he named you protector of the realm.
he did.
she won't care.
give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
and what should I do with a hundred swords?
strike!
tonight while the castle sleeps.
we must get joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
protector of the realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
every moment you delay gives cersel another moment to prepare.
by the time robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
what about stannis?
saving the seven kingdoms from cersel and delivering them to stannis?
you have odd notions about protecting the realm.
Stannis is your older brother.
this isn't about the bloody line of succession.
that didn't matter when you rebelled against the mad king.
it shouldn't matter now.
what's best for the kingdoms?
what's best for the people we rule?
we all know what stannis is.
he inspires no love or loyalty.
he's not a king.
I am.
Stannis is a commander.
he's led men into war twice.
he destroyed the greyjoy fleet - Yes, he's a good soldier.
everyone knows that. So was robert.
tell me something:
do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
I will not dishonor robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
you will sail to dragonstone tonight.
you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon.
not his steward, not his captain of the guard, and not his wife.
only stannis himself.
Yes, my lord.
now leave us.
my lord protector.
the king has no trueborn sons.
Joffrey and tommen are jaime lannister's bastards.
so when the king dies, the throne passes to his brother lord stannis.
so it would seem.
unless- - There is no "unless.
he is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
and he cannot take the throne without your help.
you would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure joffrey succeeds.
do you have a shred of honor?
you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm.
all of the power is yours.
you need only reach out and take it.
make peace with the lannisters.
release the imp.
wed your daughter to joffrey.
we have plenty of time to get rid of stannis.
and if joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat lord renly there instead.
we? - You'll need someone to share these burdens.
I assure you my price would be modest.
what you suggest is treason.
only if we lose.
make peace with the lannisters, you say...with the people who tried to murder my boy.
we only make peace with our enemies, my lord.
that's why it's called "making peace.
no.
I won't do it.
so it will be stannis and war?
there is no other choice.
he is the heir.
so why did you call me here?
not for my wisdom, clearly.
you promised catelyn you would help me.
the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms, enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.
I need the gold cloaks.
the city watch is 2, 000 strong and sworn to defend the king's peace.
look at you.
you know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.
when the queen proclaims one king and the hand proclaims another, whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?
who do they follow?
the man who pays them.
hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
night gathers and now my watch begins.
it shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the night's watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
you knelt as boys.
rise now as men of the night's watch.
well done. Well done.
what's he got there?
to me, ghost.
bring it here.
gods be good!
what will they do to him?
when the khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
and when he falls?
I saw a man last nine miles once.
king robert still wants me dead.
this poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.
he will never leave you alone.
if you ride to darkest asshal, his assassins will follow you.
if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isles, his spies would tell him.
he will never abandon the hunt.
you're a targaryen - The last targaryen.
your son will have targaryen blood with 40, 000 riders behind him.
he will not have my son.
he will not have you either, khaleesi.
lord stark!
stop! - no, all right.
it's all right. Let him through.
lord stark, king joffrey and the queen regent request your presence in the throne room.
king joffrey?
king robert is gone.
the gods give him rest.
all is accomplished. The city watch is yours.
good.
is lord renly joining us?
I fear lord renly has left the city.
he rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with ser loras tyrell and some 50 retainers.
last seen galloping south in some haste.
we stand behind you, lord stark.
all hail his grace, joffrey of houses baratheon and lannister, the first of his name, king of the andals and the first men, lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm.
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
ser barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
king robert's seal - Unbroken.
lord eddard stark is herein named protector of the realm, to rule as regent until the heir come of age.
may I see that letter, ser barristan?
protector of the realm.
is this meant to be your shield, lord stark?
a piece of paper?
those were the king's words.
we have a new king now.
lord eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.
allow me to return the courtesy.
bend the knee, my lord.
bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son, and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.
your son has no claim to the throne.
liar! - You condemn yourself with your own mouth, lord stark.
ser barristan, seize this traitor.
ser barristan is a good man, a loyal man.
do him no harm.
you think he stands alone?
kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
commander, take the queen and her children into custody.
escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
men of the watch!
I want no bloodshed.
tell your men to lay down their swords.
no one needs to die.
now!
I did warn you not to trust me.
he's attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
tell your wife to return that little shit of an imp to King's Landing.
what about Jaime Lannister?
I'm half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
we'll talk when I return from the hunt.
the hunt?
you'll have to sit on the Throne while I'm away.
you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed.
I demand a trial by combat.
you have that right. - Do I have a volunteer?
I'll stand for the dwarf.
grand Maester Pycelle.
send a raven to Casterly Rock.
inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of Gregor Clegane or be branded an enemy of the Crown and a traitor to the realm.
fight!
I'm sending you both back to Winterfell.
what? I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
he'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion.
and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.
axel Baratheon, black of hair.
robert Baratheon, black of hair.
Joffrey Baratheon, golden-haired.
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.
no, Dany, please! - A crown for a king.
the crimes of your bannerman gregor clegane, the mountain..."
Uh,"arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown.
poor ned stark...
brave man, terrible judgment.
attacking him was stupid.
Lannisters don't act like fools.
are you gonna say something clever?
go on, say something clever.
Catelyn stark took my brother.
why is he still alive?
Tyrion?
Ned stark.
one of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
why is he still alive?
it wouldn't have been clean.
clean.
you spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
that's what you want people to think of you.
it's the truth.
when you hear them whispering "kingslayer" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?
of course it bothers me.
the lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
I'm giving you half of our forces - 30, 000 men.
you will bring them to catelyn stark's girlhood home and remind her that lannisters pay their debts.
I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
he's a lannister.
he might be the lowest of the lannisters, but he's one of us.
and every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
so the lion does concern himself with the opinions of...
no, it's not an opinion. It's a fact.
if another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared.
your mother's dead.
before long I'll be dead.
and you and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
all of us dead; all of us rotting in the ground.
it's the family name that lives on.
it's all that lives on.
not your personal glory, not your honor, but family.
do you understand?
you're blessed with abilities that few men possess.
you are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms.
and you are still blessed with youth.
and what have you done with these blessings, huh?
you've served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings, one a madman, the other a drunk.
the future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
we could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
or we could collapse into nothing, as the targaryens did.
I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
not next year. Not tomorrow.
now.
you're in pain.
I've had worse, my lady.
perhaps it's time to go home.
the south doesn't seem to agree with you.
I know the truth jon arryn died for.
do you, lord stark?
is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
has he done this before?
Jaime would have killed him.
my brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
your brother...
or your lover?
the targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
we shared a womb.
we came into this world together. We belong together.
my son saw you with him.
do you love your children?
with all my heart. - No more than I love mine.
and they are all jaime's. - Thank the gods.
in the rare event that robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
in the morning, he doesn't remember. - You've always hated him.
hated him?
I worshipped him.
every girl in the seven kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
and when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the sept of baelor, lean and fierce and black-bearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
then that night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do, and whispered in my ear,"Lyanna."
your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
when the king returns from his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.
you must be gone by then, you and your children.
I will not have their blood on my hands.
go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
because wherever you go, robert's wrath will follow you.
and what of my wrath, lord stark?
you should have taken the realm for yourself.
Jaime told me about the day king's landing fell.
he was sitting in the iron throne and you made him give it up.
all you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
such a sad mistake.
I've made many mistakes in my life, but that wasn't one of them.
Oh, but it was.
when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.
there is no middle ground.
come here.
Oh yes, oh.
Oh yes yes yes.
no no no no!
is that what they teach you up in the north?
and you - Wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?
Yes, my lord.
let's start over, shall we?
you be the man and you be the woman.
well, go ahead.
slowly.
you're not fooling them.
they just paid you.
they know what you are.
they know it's all just an act.
your job is to make them forget what they know.
that takes time.
you need to... ease into it.
go ahead.
ease into it.
he's winning you over in spite of yourself.
you're starting to like this.
he wants to believe you.
he's enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.
why shouldn't you?
he knows he's better than other men.
he's always known it deep down inside.
now he has proof.
he's so good, he's reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.
why don't you join us, my lord?
I'm saving myself for another.
what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
a stupid saying.
what we don't know is usually what gets us killed.
she must be very beautiful.
no, not really.
impeccable bloodlines though.
I do believe my lord's in love.
for many years.
most of my life really.
play with her ass.
and she loved me too.
I was her little confidant, her plaything.
she could tell me anything, anything at all.
she told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry:
a northerner with a jaw like an anvil.
so I challenged him to a duel.
I mean, why not? I'd read all the stories.
the little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
in the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.
"he's just a boy," she said."Please don't hurt him."
so he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by - and off they went.
is she still married to him?
Oh no.
he got himself killed before the wedding...
and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
she loves him, i'm afraid.
and why wouldn't she? I mean, who could compare to him? he's just so...
good.
do you know what I learned, losing that duel?
I learned that i'll never win, not that way.
that's their game, their rules.
I'm not going to fight them.
I'm going to fuck them.
that's what I know.
that's what I am.
and only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
and what do you want?
Oh, everything, my dear.
everything there is.
now wash yourselves.
both of you are working tonight.
you're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
where I come from, we don't show mercy to criminals.
where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord?
at low tide we'd lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.
the sea would come in closer and closer.
you'd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time.
where is it you come from?
the iron islands.
they far away?
you've never heard of the iron islands?
trust me, you've never heard where I'm from neither.
trust me, my lord.
you're not living in the wilderness anymore.
in civilized lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
and what's that?
Lord.
Why?
what do you mean why?
my father is balon greyjoy, lord of the iron islands.
what's that got to do with you?
if your father's lord, how can you be lord too?
I will be lord after my father - so you're not lord now?
no, you
are you having a go at me?
is that it?
I just don't understand how you southerners do things.
I'm not a southerner.
you're from south of the wall.
that makes you a southerner to me.
you're an impudent little wench, aren't you?
couldn't say, my lord.
don't know what "impunent" means.
impudent.
it means rude, disrespectful.
do you want to lose that chain?
Theon greyjoy!
the lady is our guest.
I thought she was our prisoner.
are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
chances are I won't be nearby the next time that happens.
I'm used to worse than him.
I'm used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
why did you come here?
didn't mean to come here.
meant to get much further south than this.
as far south as south goes, before the long night comes.
Why?
what are you afraid of?
there's things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
owls and shadowcats and - I'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.
the "things" you speak of, they've been gone for thousands of years.
they wasn't gone, old man.
they was sleeping.
and they ain't sleeping no more.
I miss girls.
not even talking to them. I never talked to them.
just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
don't you miss girls?
riders.
the horn.
we have to blow the horn.
why is he alone?
one blast for a ranger returning, - two for wildlings, three for- - There's no rider.
whoa, boy, whoa.
that's my uncle benjen's horse.
Where's my uncle?
Ned!
it's robert.
we were hunting- A boar...
I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
I was never meant to be a father.
go on.
you don't want to see this.
my fault.
too much wine, missed my thrust.
it stinks.
it stinks like death.
don't think I can't smell it.
I paid the bastard back, ned.
I drove my knife right through his brain.
you ask them if I didn't. Ask them!
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the kingdoms ever saw.
and I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to ned.
Robert, my sweet- - Out, all of you!
you damned fool.
paper and ink on the table, write down what I say.
in the name of robert of the house baratheon, first of...
you know how it goes.
fill in the damn titles.
I hereby command eddard of house stark
titles, titles - "to serve as lord regent and protector of the realm upon my death, to rule in my stead until my son joffrey comes of age.
give it over.
give it to the council after I'm dead.
at least they'll say I did this right, this one thing.
you'll rule now.
you'll hate it worse than I did, but you'll do it well.
the girl - Daenerys.
you were right.
Varys, littlefinger, my brother... Worthless.
no one to tell me "no" but you.
only you.
let her live.
stop it, if it's not too late.
I will.
and my son...
help him, ned.
make him better than me.
I'll... I'll do everything I can to honor your memory.
my memory.
king robert baratheon, murdered by a pig.
give me something for the pain and let me die.
give him milk of the poppy.
he was reeling from the wine.
he commanded us to step aside, but...
I failed him.
no man could have protected him from himself.
I wonder, ser barristan, who gave the king this wine?
his squire, from the king's own skin.
his squire?
the lannister boy?
such a dutiful boy to make sure his grace did not lack refreshment.
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
his grace has had a change of heart concerning daenerys targaryen.
whatever arrangements you made, unmake them.
at once.
I'm afraid those birds have flown.
the girl is likely dead already.
throne. - Throne.
can't you help me make him understand?
the dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
have patience, khaleesi.
we will go home, I promise you.
my brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the seven kingdoms.
have I said something funny, ser?
forgive me, khaleesi, but your ancestor aegon the conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right.
he had no right to them.
he seized them because he could.
and because he had dragons.
ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
you don't believe it.
have you ever seen a dragon, khaleesi?
I believe what my eyes and ears report.
as for the rest... It was 300 years ago.
who knows what really happened?
now if you'll pardon me, I'll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me.
I'll come with you. - No no, don't trouble yourself.
enjoy the market.
I'll rejoin you soon enough.
psst, jorah the andal.
the spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
a royal pardon - You can go home now.
my son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine.
just a taste.
my lady, you are from westeros.
you have the honor of addressing daenerys of the house targaryen, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the seven kingdoms.
princess. - Rise.
I'd still like to taste that wine.
that?
Dornish swill.
not worthy of a princess.
I have a dry red from the arbor - Nectar of the gods.
let me give you a cask.
uh- a gift. - You honor me, ser.
the honor - The honor is all mine.
there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, princess.
I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Rakharo.
is something wrong? - I have a thirst.
open it.
the wine is for the khaleesi.
it's not for the likes of you.
open it.
pour.
it would be a crime to drink a wine this rich - without at least giving it time to breathe.
do as he says.
as the princess commands.
sweet, isn't it?
can you smell the fruit, ser?
taste it, my lord.
tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
you first.
me?
I'm afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
you will drink.
Khaleesi! - Stop him!
come.
you came to us as outlaws, poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
you came alone, in chains, without friends nor honor.
you came to us rich and you came to us poor.
some of you bear the names of proud houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
it does not matter.
all that is in the past.
here, on the wall, we are all one house.
tonight...
you're allowed to look happy.
you're going to be a ranger.
isn't that what you always wanted?
I want to find my uncle.
I know he's alive out there.
I know he is.
I wish I could help you, but I'm no ranger.
it's the steward's life for me.
there's honor in being a steward.
not much, really.
but there's food.
here you begin anew.
a man of the night's watch...lives his life for the realm.
not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house;
not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love;
but for the realm and all the people in it.
you've all learned the words of the vow.
think carefully before you say them.
the penalty for desertion is death.
you can take your vows here tonight at sunset.
do any of you still keep the old gods?
I do, my lord.
you'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did.
Yes, my lord.
you'll find a weirwood a mile north of the wall.
and your old gods too, maybe.
my lord, might I go as well?
does house tarly keep the old gods?
no, my lord.
I was named in the light of the seven, as my father was and his father before him.
why would you forsake the gods of your father and your house?
the night's watch is my house now.
the seven have never answered my prayers.
perhaps the old gods will.
as you wish, lad.
you've all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
halder to the builders.
pyp to the stewards.
toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.
Samwell to the stewards.
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.
Balian to the rangers.
Rast to the rangers.

Rancer to the builders.

Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.
Vorkoy to the builders. Joby to the stables.

allo to the builders.
Nelugo to the rangers.
may all the gods preserve you.
Rangers with me.
builders!
samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
Pyp, you will report to bowen marsh in the kitchens.
Luke, report to one-eyed joe in the stables.
Dareon, we are sending you to eastwatch.
present yourself to borcas when you arrive.
make no comment about his nose.
jon snow, lord commander mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
will I serve the lord commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath?
certainly.
and keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the lord commander requires of you.
do you take me for a servant?
we took you for a man of the night's watch.
but perhaps we were wrong in that.
may I go?
as you wish.
Jon, wait!
don't you see what they're doing?
I see ser alliser's revenge, that's all.
he wanted it and he got it.
stewards are nothing but maids!
I'm a better swordsman and rider than any of you!
it's not fair.
fair?
I was singing for a high lord at acorn hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
I pushed him away and he said he'd have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
so now I'm here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.
I'll never see my family again.
I'll never be inside a woman again.
so don't tell me about fair.
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
you think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
could you sing me a song, pyp?
I'd like to hear a song.
now listen to me.
the old man is the lord commander of the night's watch.
you'll be with him day and night.
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.
but you'll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
you'll know everything, be part of everything.
and he asked for you himself.
he wants to groom you for command.
I just...
I always wanted to be a ranger.
I always wanted to be a wizard.
what?
no, I'm serious.
so you'll stay and say your words with me?
lord stark, a moment.
alone if you will.
he named you protector of the realm.
he did.
she won't care.
give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
and what should I do with a hundred swords?
strike!
tonight while the castle sleeps.
we must get joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
protector of the realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
every moment you delay gives cersel another moment to prepare.
by the time robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
what about stannis?
saving the seven kingdoms from cersel and delivering them to stannis?
you have odd notions about protecting the realm.
Stannis is your older brother.
this isn't about the bloody line of succession.
that didn't matter when you rebelled against the mad king.
it shouldn't matter now.
what's best for the kingdoms?
what's best for the people we rule?
we all know what stannis is.
he inspires no love or loyalty.
he's not a king.
I am.
Stannis is a commander.
he's led men into war twice.
he destroyed the greyjoy fleet - Yes, he's a good soldier.
everyone knows that. So was robert.
tell me something:
do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
I will not dishonor robert's last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.
you will sail to dragonstone tonight.
you will place this in the hand of stannis baratheon.
not his steward, not his captain of the guard, and not his wife.
only stannis himself.
Yes, my lord.
now leave us.
my lord protector.
the king has no trueborn sons.
Joffrey and tommen are jaime lannister's bastards.
so when the king dies, the throne passes to his brother lord stannis.
so it would seem.
unless- - There is no "unless.
he is the rightful heir. Nothing can change that.
and he cannot take the throne without your help.
you would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure joffrey succeeds.
do you have a shred of honor?
you are now hand of the king and protector of the realm.
all of the power is yours.
you need only reach out and take it.
make peace with the lannisters.
release the imp.
wed your daughter to joffrey.
we have plenty of time to get rid of stannis.
and if joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat lord renly there instead.
we? - You'll need someone to share these burdens.
I assure you my price would be modest.
what you suggest is treason.
only if we lose.
make peace with the lannisters, you say...with the people who tried to murder my boy.
we only make peace with our enemies, my lord.
that's why it's called "making peace.
no.
I won't do it.
so it will be stannis and war?
there is no other choice.
he is the heir.
so why did you call me here?
not for my wisdom, clearly.
you promised catelyn you would help me.
the queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-at-arms, enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.
I need the gold cloaks.
the city watch is 2, 000 strong and sworn to defend the king's peace.
look at you.
you know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it's not honorable so the words stick in your throat.
when the queen proclaims one king and the hand proclaims another, whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?
who do they follow?
the man who pays them.
hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
night gathers and now my watch begins.
it shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the night's watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
you knelt as boys.
rise now as men of the night's watch.
well done. Well done.
what's he got there?
to me, ghost.
bring it here.
gods be good!
what will they do to him?
when the khalasar rides, he'll be leashed to a saddle, forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
and when he falls?
I saw a man last nine miles once.
king robert still wants me dead.
this poisoner was the first. He won't be the last.
I thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.
he will never leave you alone.
if you ride to darkest asshal, his assassins will follow you.
if you sailed all the way to the basilisk isles, his spies would tell him.
he will never abandon the hunt.
you're a targaryen - The last targaryen.
your son will have targaryen blood with 40, 000 riders behind him.
he will not have my son.
he will not have you either, khaleesi.
lord stark!
stop! - no, all right.
it's all right. Let him through.
lord stark, king joffrey and the queen regent request your presence in the throne room.
king joffrey?
king robert is gone.
the gods give him rest.
all is accomplished. The city watch is yours.
good.
is lord renly joining us?
I fear lord renly has left the city.
he rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with ser loras tyrell and some 50 retainers.
last seen galloping south in some haste.
we stand behind you, lord stark.
all hail his grace, joffrey of houses baratheon and lannister, the first of his name, king of the andals and the first men, lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm.
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councilors.
ser barristan, I believe no man here could ever question your honor.
king robert's seal - Unbroken.
lord eddard stark is herein named protector of the realm, to rule as regent until the heir come of age.
may I see that letter, ser barristan?
protector of the realm.
is this meant to be your shield, lord stark?
a piece of paper?
those were the king's words.
we have a new king now.
lord eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.
allow me to return the courtesy.
bend the knee, my lord.
bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son, and we shall allow you to live out your days in the gray waste you call home.
your son has no claim to the throne.
liar! - You condemn yourself with your own mouth, lord stark.
ser barristan, seize this traitor.
ser barristan is a good man, a loyal man.
do him no harm.
you think he stands alone?
kill him! Kill all of them, I command it!
commander, take the queen and her children into custody.
escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
men of the watch!
I want no bloodshed.
tell your men to lay down their swords.
no one needs to die.
now!
I did warn you not to trust me.
boy.
lovely boy.
what do you want? A man has a thirst.
the man does not drink for a day and a night.
a boy could make a friend. I have friends.
give us a beer. Before I skin you.
a man does not choose his companions. These two, they have no courtesy.
a man must ask forgiveness.
you're called Arry.
this man has the honor to be Jaqen H'ghar.
once of the Free City of Lorath.
Hey, you little shit.
get us beer! You should have asked nicely.
come closer.
and I'll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody.
the boy has more courage than sense.
come here!
Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three.
they don't scare me. Then you're stupid.
they scare me.
would a gold collector look this far from King's Landing?
what are you doing? They're looking for me.
you're in command here?
you're a long way from home.
I asked you a question. Aye, you did.
you asked without manners. And I chose not to answer.
I have a royal warrant.
for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
well the thing is, these gutter rats belong to the Night's Watch now.
that puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens.
it's a funny thing.
people worry so much about their throats, they forget about what's down low.
now I sharpened this blade before breakfast.
I could shave a spider's arse if I wanted to.
or, I could nick this artery in your leg and once it's nicked, there's no one around here who knows how to un-nick it.
we'll just keep that.
good steel is always needed on the wall. Seems you have a choice.
you can die here at this crossroads a long way from home.
or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didn't find what you were looking for.
we're looking for a boy named Gendry. He carries a bull's head helmet.
anyone turning him over will earn the King's reward.
we'll be back. With more men.
and I'll be taking your head home along with that bastard boy.
my lord. You make me wait a long time.
and your friend keeps me company.
we were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
it was quite a battle.
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
the northerners are such fearsome warriors.
and I tell him the story of how we meet.
to find such a lovely creature working in your father's kitchen.
it almost beggars belief. Strange things do happen.
you should taste her fish pie.
I don't think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
how can you tell? I can always tell.
men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us.
we'll make a fisherman of him yet.
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.
friends are such an important part of life.
unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come.
but rest easy my lord,
I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.
your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.
how unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest.
I will leave you.
welcome to Kings Landing, my dear.
the city is made brighter by your presence.
we have a council meeting, my lord.
I don't like threats. Who threatened you?
I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
Ned Stark was a man of honor. And I am not.
threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
you might be disappointed in the results.
the storms come and go.
the big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling.
come, my lord.
we shouldn't keep the queen waiting.
from this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.
he has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.
you've perfected the art of tearing up papers.
give him his father's bones back, at least as a gesture of good faith.
you'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace.
did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
I did.
they have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
if you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.
I will, Your Grace. Safe travels, cousin.
you have a deft hand with diplomacy. If that's everything?
a raven flew in this morning from Castle Black.
trouble with the wildlings?
that's why they're called wildlings.
somewhat less wild these days.
it seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this
King-Beyond-the-Wall.
another king? How many is that now? Five? I've lost count.
lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.
the northerners are a superstitious people.
according to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers.
Mormont doesn't lie. How do you kill a dead man?
apparently you burn him.
one trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks.
I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you.
the Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.
I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
night, sir.
the gods wanted us to have dignity, wouldn't make us fart when we died.
we fart when we die?
my blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world.
she farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives.
wouldn't two or three be enough for him?
we were having a serious discussion.
would you look at that.
nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
I prefer watching them come towards me.
I'm sure that's nice too.
well, there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up.
and we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old.
and then we got older,
you were with her?
how many times?
well, as many times as I could.
wish I'd grew up on a farm. We need more potatoes.
I'll get another sack for the sludge.
get the turnips too.
no, Ghost, no!
no.
ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo!
you all right?
did he frighten you? - You shouldn't touch me.
Oh, oh. Right.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt.
you're very brave.
what's he doing?
this is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.
Hello, Gilly. What's he doing? Sam said you could help.
I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed... She's pregnant.
we have to take her with us, when we leave.
what? I know it sounds a bit mad.
no it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.
the Lord Commander... - We are sworn to protect.
Sam we can't take her. - Please sir, please.
I can still run if I have to.
it's just not possible.
I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I...
if it's a boy, what?
you want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.
why did you do that? Do what, ask her a question?
you were cruel. - Cruel!?
Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
I didn't touch her! - No you just want to steal her, what do you think Craster cuts off for that?
I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.
we're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her?
who's gonna deliver her baby? You?
I could try...
what? I've read about it.
a bit.
I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.
Khaleesi.
you don't need to see this. - He is blood of my blood.
who did this?
Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo...
they don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasar.
they will like it far less when I'm done with them.
is it as you remember my lord?
looks smaller. Everything looks bigger when you're a child.
I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little.
now look at it...
they'll be waiting for me on the docks.
who will?
anyone who matters, this is a big day for them.
they haven't had much to get excited about since I left.
it's a hard place the Iron Islands... always has been.
it's cold and it's wet. I love the cold and wet.
they say hard places breed hard men, and hard men rule the world.
then you'll be king before long.
try smiling with your lips closed.
hmm, better.
my father doesn't trust you Iron islanders. I don't blame him.
he says that you're all reavers and rapers.
and that no matter how many women you have, you'll never be satis...
quit talking about your father.
he's right about us.
our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us.
that's why we take saltwives from the women we capture.
capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore.
make me your saltwife. - Your place is on this ship.
not after you leave.
father will punish me. He'll call me a whore.
I haven't paid you.
I barely touched her.
and you charge twice as much as every other brothel.
and this is what I get, crying. - One moment, my friend.
a moment.
please accept my sincerest apologies.
Ramka will take good care of you.
sorry my lord. - Shhh.
did he hurt you?
not, my lord.
it's Megan. - Who?
she works for you.
she's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby.
Ah, yes, that was poorly handled.
sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.
can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep.
her poor little baby.
you know you remind me of another girl?
a lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house.
beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself.
but she wasn't happy.
she cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have.
Yes, it was quite sad.
girls from Lysean pleasure houses are expensive.
extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money.
I hate bad investments.
really, I do. They haunt me.
I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses.
a very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl.
to use her in ways that never occur to most men.
and you know what occurs to most men.
I wouldn't say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated.
take tonight off. To mourn Megan's child, will see you tomorrow.
better be happy.
that makes me happy.
more wine?
damn it, boy! - Apologies, my lord.
leave us, Podrik. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
is that your new squire? Could have found you a proper lad.
myself, I prefer the improper ones.
hmm, that's a good red.
Dornish? - You know your wines, my lord.
that I do.
a fine dinner, my lord. Call me Tyrion, please.
I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.
maybe I'll hire this cook of yours.
wars have been started for less.
I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
hmm. Nasty business, had to be done.
Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace.
only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.
orders are orders. - Quite right.
especially the queen's orders. I never said they were the queen's orders.
no, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards?
she's always been a jealous woman. - You know your sister better than I do.
you've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister. I don't listen to filth.
that's good of you, but you have heard them.
I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.
Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. I appreciate your loyalty.
tell me.
when your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?
I did. And I would again.
the man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
the fool.
he had no idea you were already bought. Are you drunk?
I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos.
I'm denying its existence.
you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf.
dwarf? You should have stopped at imp.
and yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.
I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
what are you?
my friends at court will not allow this.
the queen herself... The queen regent.
and you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
we shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. No, we shan't.
there's a ship leaving for East Watch by the Sea tonight.
from there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black.
I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.
the lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.
these men are under my command. I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
his name is Bronn and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
boys.
I have friends at court. Powerful friends.
the king himself made me a lord.
to the new Commander.
if I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?
without question? No.
I'd ask how much.
if they come back, I say we yield. Gendry's the one they want.
I don't want to get caught in the middle of a battle. I'm not afraid of no battles.
if you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.
I've seen lots of battles.
I saw... - Liar.
I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
stabbed him right in the neck.
two men fighting isn't a battle. They had armor on.
so?
so, if they got armor on, it's a battle. No, it isn't.
what's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
Gendry's an armorer's apprentice.
hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.
it's when they've got armor on.
I already told you that. A knight?
how'd you know he was a knight?
well, cause they got armor on.
you don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor.
how'd you know? Cause I sold armor.
what do the gold-clips want with you? No idea.
you're a liar. You shouldn't insult people that are bigger than you.
then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. No one gets to insult anyone.
no good's ever come of those questions. No good's ever come?
you've asked questions before?
how can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass? Were you asked questions?
the Hand of the King. The Hands of the King.
lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died.
and then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died.
lord Stark.
see? Asking me questions is bad luck.
you'll probably be dead soon. What did they ask about?
my mom. - Who's your mom?
just my mom. Worked in a tavern. Died when I was little.
and who was your father?
he could be one of those gold-hatted bastards, for all I know. What about you, anyway?
I thought they were after you?
Why?
did you kill someone? Or is it just because you're a girl?
I'm not a girl! Yes you are.
you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls. Everyone knows that.
that's true. You're still a girl. I am not!
well, pull your cock out and take a piss then.
I don't need to take a piss.
I'm in hot pike, aren't I now? No one can know.
they won't. Not from me.
my name's not Arry.
it's Arya. Of House Stark.
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
he was your father. The Hand. The traitor.
he was never a traitor. Joffrey is a liar.
so you're a highborn, then. You're a lady. - No.
I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister.
you were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle.
I've been pissing in front of you and everything.
I should be calling you milady. Do not call me milady.
as milady commands. Well, that was unladylike.
what you carrying?
pears and oranges.
wine from the Arbor.
and the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands.
the only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
me.
don't like wine. Woman's drink.
I need to get to Pyke.
I'll find you a horse.
I'm heading that way. I can take you there.
I bet you can. You been at sea long?
or were there just no women where you came from?
none like you. You don't know what I'm like.
you don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you.
know who I am?
you think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry.
lord Greyjoy.
have my things sent up to the castle.
you should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you.
I've been on horseback for the last nine years.
nine years. You still know your way around a ship?
have these hands ever touched a rope?
don't you worry about my hands.
the sea's in my blood.
you'll never be in the sea if I don't watch where I'm going.
I have a proposal for my father.
one that will make him king again.
and me after him.
you can tell your grandchildren about this night.
I don't imagine it will be a story fit for children.
father. Nine years, is it?
they took a frightened boy.
what have they given back?
a man.
your blood and your heir. - We shall see.
stark had you longer than I did.
lord Stark is gone.
and how do you feel about that?
what's done is done.
I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark. Who gave you those clothes?
was it Ned Stark's pleasure to make you his daughter?
if my clothes offend you, I will change them. It will.
that bauble around your neck.
did you pay the iron price for it or the gold?
I asked a question.
did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes?
iron or gold?
gold.
I'll not have my son dressed as a whore.
my fears have come true.
the Starks have made you theirs. My blood is salt and iron.
yet, the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven, clutching his message.
the offer he makes, is one I proposed. He heeds your counsel?
I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.
no, not here, not in my hearing, you will not name him brother.
this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword.
or have you forgotten your own blood? I forget nothing.
I remember my brothers.
and I remember when my father was a king.
I see.
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again.
I will lead the attack myself. Oh, you will?
I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
I told you to wait outside.
how did you get past the guards?
anything with a cock is easy to fool.
my dear.
Yara? - So good to see you, brother.
this is a homecoming I'll tell my grandchildren about.
she can't lead an attack. And why not?
you're a woman. You're the one in skirts.
this isn't Winterfell, boy.
your sister took over command of your eldest brother's ship after your new father killed him.
what's dead may never die.
the only night she's spent off these islands has been spent on the sea.
she's commanded men. She's killed men.
she knows who she is.
no man gives me a crown.
I pay the iron price.
I will take my crown. That is who I am.
that is who we have always been.
you won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
who said anything about the Lannisters?
you'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
all these kings fighting for the throne and this Stannis has the smallest army.
why would I bet on the man with the worst chance? Because you're a smart gambler.
Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice.
his baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield.
neither has the false king, Joffrey.
and yet, they both have larger armies. Stannis has just begun the fight.
his bannermen will rally to his cause.
there's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon.
or more worthy of loyalty.
what is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings.
mind your words, pirate. - Matthos.
you think I'm insulted?
I am a pirate. I'm an excellent pirate. I don't sail for promises.
of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise.
a promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.
that's a promise that always comes true. As is mine.
you're not the young man, Salladhor.
and correct me if I'm wrong, most pirates don't grow old.
only the clever ones. You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you.
that's easy. What I'm offering you is hard.
come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros.
you'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous.
they'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs. It is.
one thing, I want the queen. - The queen?
Cersei, I want her.
I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay,
I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well.
this war isn't about you.
we're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her.
as if she would just let you. You don't know how persuasive I am.
I never tried to fuck you.
Stannis is the rightful king. And the Lord of Light.
the one true god.
I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god.
they all think they found the right one.
the one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs.
I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
he's young yet. I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
you believe your king can win? He is the one true king.
you Westerosers are funny people.
a man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him.
I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
you are the most honest smuggler I ever met.
make me rich.
get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
when will the King have a sail? As soon as his God wills it.
he's my God too, and yours... but you were too blind to see.
let me teach you how to read. - Oh, you and your mother.
it won't take long, you already know the letters.
the holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
I wish I had a God, truly!
I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is.
pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home, - None of it works! - But you always came home.
I wasn't praying, you know.
but I was.
every night that you were at sea,
I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
you want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god.
he raised me up and blessed me with his trust.
he gave you a future I could never have imagined.
you know how to read, you'll be a knight someday.
you think your fire god commanded all that?
it was Stannis. Only Stannis.
Stannis is my king, but he's only a man.
don't tell him that.
lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
you're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here.
I am Queen Regent. - Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people.
do you hear me? - The people?
you think I care?
you might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead.
half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you.
and gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry.
the Queen slaughters babies.
you don't even have the decency to deny it.
it wasn't you who gave the order, was it?
Joffrey didn't even tell you.
did he tell you?
I imagine that would be even worse. He did what needed to be done.
you want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule?
this is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.
I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.
I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously.
you haven't, Jaime hasn't.
it's all fallen on me.
as has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.
you're funny.
you've always been funny.
but none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they?
you remember...
back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.
she was my mother too.
now they're gone, for the sake of you.
there's no bigger joke in the world than that.
your Grace. - Your Grace.
how did it fare with your pirate? Salladhor Saan will join our fleet.
30 ships, his men know how to fight.
in my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
does seem the wiser choice. - It won't be a choice this time.
do you trust him?
Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years.
I've never trusted him.
now once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops.
well if he does his job, he'll have his share.
leave us.
at once, Your Grace.
the Lord of Light shines through you, young warrior.
come.
what did you say to him?
I told him death by fire is the purest death.
Why? - Because it is true.
you're troubled my king. Yeah.
these armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
tell your lord to burn them then. I tell him nothing!
I pray for his commands and I obey.
my little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts.
men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
you must have faith. - Faith?
in a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.
then we must be the ten. I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.
but first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light.
I've said the words, damn you.
I burnt the idols.
you must give all of yourself.
I have a wife.
I took a vow.
she's sick.
weak.
shut away in a tower.
she disgusts you.
and she's given you nothing.
no sons.
only stillborns. Only death.
I will give you...
a son, my King.
a son?
tomorrow you'll ride south to the Stormlands.
I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.
if Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one.
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital.
but I am very good at keeping secrets from my good friends.
your discretion is legendary.
you in command here?
I have a royal warrant for one of these gutter rats you're transporting.
we're looking for a boy named Gendry.
we'll be back with more men.
this is Gilly. She's one of Craster's daughters.
we have to take her with us when we leave.
I'm going to have a baby. If it's a boy...
if it's a boy, what?
seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.
the queen herself - The queen regent.
and you're a fool to believe she is your friend.
I hope you enjoy the Wall.
I have friends at court!
to the new Commander.
I need to get to Pyke.
I'm heading that way, Lord Greyjoy.
I destroy Robb Stark's enemies for him and he will make me king of the Iron Islands once again.
I will lead the attack myself.
Oh, you will?
I'm your son, who else?
Yara?
so good to see you, brother.
she can't lead an attack.
she's commanded men.
she's killed men.
no man gives me a crown. I will take my crown.
out, all of you.
bastard's been meddling where he shouldn't!
I want you and your men gone.
and you will make this right.
wait outside.
lord Commander. - Now!
lord Commander.
leave us.
what did you do?
I followed him.
he took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
what business is that of yours?
no, you don't understand.
he's killing them, all the boys.
you know.
the wildlings serve crueler Gods than you or I.
those boys are Craster's offerings.
offerings?
he's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our Rangers.
your Uncle among them.
we have other wars to fight out there.
like it or not, we need men like Craster.
I... I saw it.
I saw... Something take that child.
Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again.
now ready my horse.
we leave at dawn.
don't lose it again.
Gilly.
you're leaving.
I - I wanted to give you something.
it belonged to my mother.
I can't take it. - Please.
I want you to.
my mother used it for sewing.
she'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her.
my father put a stop to it when he found out.
it's the only thing I have of hers.
she gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
you-- you shouldn't give it away.
I'm not giving it away.
I'm giving it to you.
keep it safe for me.
till I come back.
Hodor.
Hodor.
rouse Bran, will you?
it's time for his lessons.
every night it's the same.
I'm walking and running, but...
I'm not - I'm not me.
I'm running through the Godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling.
old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
that's exactly what they are, Bran-- stories.
so she was lying?
they don't exist?
well, they may have done.
but they're gone from the world along with much else.
these are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
no, my dreams are different.
mine are true.
I dreamt of my father dying.
and Rickon had the same dream.
what about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?
right.
this link is made of Valyrian steel.
only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.
it signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.
and all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.
I was no different.
I was young.
and what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?
but in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than 1, 000 boys before me.
come on.
all right.
maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.
but not anymore.
the Dragons are gone.
the Giants are dead.
and the Children of the Forest forgotten.
Loras! Highgarden!
yield! I yield.
well fought.
approach.
rise. Remove your helm.
you are all your father promised and more, My Lady.
I've seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
now, now, my love.
my brother fought valiantly for you.
that he did, my Queen.
but there can only be one champion.
Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire.
if it is within my power, it is yours.
your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.
what?
I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
done.
rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.
lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
lady Catelyn.
I'm pleased to see you.
may I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell?
you are very welcome here, Lady Stark.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
you are most kind.
my Lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband's murder.
when I take King's Landing, I'll bring you Joffrey's head.
it will be enough to know that justice was done, My Lord.
your Grace.
and you should kneel when you approach the King.
there's no need for that.
lady Stark is an honored guest.
has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
I do not sit on my son's war councils.
and if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
if Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother's skirts.
my son is fighting a war, not playing at one.
don't worry, My Lady.
our war is just beginning.
your Grace. - Gerard.
how's your foot?
better, Your Grace.
they don't know their own size is all.
good man.
I have 100, 000 men at my command.
all the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
and all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?
it's a game to you, isn't it?
I pity them.
Why?
because it won't last.
because they are the Knights of summer and winter is coming.
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.
she's tired from her journey.
at once, Your Grace.
shall I return after?
that won't be necessary.
I would pray awhile.
alone.
if you'll follow me, My Lady.
you fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
I fought for my King.
soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield.
die for him if I must.
and, if it please you, Brienne's enough.
I'm no lady.
what are you doing here?
I live here.
are you angry with me, brother?
you lying bitch.
it's not my fault you didn't recognize me.
recognize you?
how could I?
the last time I saw you...
you looked like a fat little boy.
you were a fat little boy, too, but I recognized you.
why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to see who you were first.
and I did.
the plans are made. It's time you heard them.
father. - Father.
the wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the northern army at his back.
while he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the north is ripe for the taking.
the Ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast.
we'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above.
every stronghold will yield to us one by one.
Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?
the rest shall be ours-- forest, field and hall.
Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
I've always wanted a castle.
and what's my role in all this?
you'll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
a ship?
you give her 30 and I get one?
the sea bitch.
we thought she'd be perfect for you.
I'm to fight fishermen?
be careful of their nets.
father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men.
he won't give up the North so easily.
they won't even know we're there until it's too late. - What do you know of it, woman?
I'm a proven warrior.
your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
I'm not protecting anyone.
I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait.
why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?
rise up against them and they could destroy us.
but if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.
what are our words?
our words?
we do not sow. - "We do not sow."
we are Ironborn.
we're not subjects. We're not slaves.
we do not plow the fields or toil in the mine.
we take what is ours.
your time with the wolves has made you weak.
you act as if I volunteered to go.
you gave me away, if you remember.
the day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.
after he crushed you.
did you take what was yours then?
you gave me away!
your boy!
your last boy!
you gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore.
and now you curse me because I've come home.
you'd have our father bow down to your other family?
I have no other family.
don't you?
make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.
our ships sail with or without you.
you won't let me leave this room.
you won't let me - Shh, shh, keep your voice down.
Why?
you think your father can hear me?
he's 300 miles away!
I don't intend for you to stay here.
I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
again, only temporary.
every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
but you wouldn't be a cook.
you'd pose as a scullion.
scullion? What is a scullion?
kitchen wench.
a kitchen wench?
Yes, but-- Cleaning pots?
is that how my lion wants to see me?
your lion wants to see you alive.
we've come to a dangerous place.
my sister wants to hurt me.
she'll look for any weakness she can find.
she can't know about you.
I'm the weakness?
it's a compliment, My Lady.
how is being a weakness a compliment?
language can be a bit tricky here.
Oh, I'm too stupid to understand.
the stupid foreign girl.
I am not a kitchen wench.
when will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
soon, darling, when the war is over.
mother says I'll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast.
but yours will be ivory since you're the bride.
the Princess just spoke to you.
pardon, Your Grace.
I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.
I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the Gods.
is Joffrey going to kill Sansa's brother?
he might.
would you like that?
no. I don't think so.
even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.
won't you, little dove?
come in.
who are you?
I'm Shae, My Lady. Your new handmaiden.
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden.
you're not from here.
no.
what are you doing?
waiting for you to tell me what to do.
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things.
you should just do them.
what things?
change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
no.
you said to brush-- Not now.
your chamber pot is empty.
clean the table.
have you ever been a handmaiden before?
Yes. - For whom?
lady Zuriff.
lady Zuriff?
lady Zuriff.
there is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
she wasn't in this city.
well, I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.
and I don't have time to answer 1, 000 questions and teach you how to do your job.
do you want me to leave?
just brush my hair.
Oh, thank the Gods.
I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
I've encountered this problem before, My Lord.
the stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect.
two drops with water daily.
right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
please.
thank you, My Lord.
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
why, yes, of course, My Lord.
these are perilous times.
and the crown must forge new alliances.
and these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
matrimony, huh?
Yes.
I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the queen mustn't know.
we can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm.
there's too much at stake.
Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes.
I shall be silent as the grave.
I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.
princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it.
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
but remember, the queen mustn't know.
Ooh,"the queen mustn't know.
I love conversations that begin this way.
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
Theon Greyjoy?
forgive me, My Lord, but how?
he grew up a ward of Winterfell.
he fights for Robb Stark.
precisely.
theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.
Greyjoy can destroy the northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
but remember, you must tell no one.
tell no one what?
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.
Lysa is not fond of me.
but perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
she imprisoned you.
she tried to execute you.
and you offer her son a princess?
for men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?
and I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
who better?
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to.
what's in it for me?
the gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold...
and Harrenhal.
Harrenhal is cursed.
never took you for a superstitious man.
by all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it.
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
with a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
you served my family well in the matter of the succession.
so did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.
until you snatched it away.
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.
I didn't need Janos Slynt.
it's settled, then?
good.
Oh, and remember
the queen ... - mustn't know.
that must hurt.
what? What is it?
a member of the Kingsguard?
as if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
Brienne is a very capable warrior.
and she's devoted to me.
you're jealous.
jealous?
of Brienne the beauty?
don't make me laugh.
I'll make it up to you.
no, Your Grace.
not tonight.
there's another Tyrell who requires your attention.
you didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone.
your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.
brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
and Margaery's a virgin?
officially.
shall I bring her to you?
I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine.
as is your right. You are a King.
you look very beautiful.
thank you, Your Grace.
it's a lovely gown.
you think so?
I can't decide how I like it better.
this way... or this way.
you certainly don't need it.
although...
some say that beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
must be the wine.
here, let me.
I'm sorry.
do you want my brother to come in and help?
what?
he could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind.
or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
I don't know what you're talking about.
there's no need for us to play games.
save your lies for court.
you're going to need a lot of them.
your enemies aren't happy about us.
they want to tear us apart.
and the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly.
we can try again later.
you decide how you want to do it-- with me, with me and Loras.
however else you like.
whatever you need to do.
you are a King.
you monster.
Myrcella is my only daughter.
do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
Myrcella's a Princess.
some would say she was born for this.
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
Dorne is the safest place or her.
are you mad?
the Martells loathe us.
that's why we need to seduce them.
we're going to need their support in the war your son started.
she'll be a hostage. - A guest.
you won't get away with this.
you think the piece of paper father gave you keeps you safe.
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
it's done, Cersei. - No.
you cannot stop it.
No!
just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?
do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?
make no mistake.
they'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
get out! Get out!

Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the drowned God?
I would.
kneel.
let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.
bless him with salt.
bless him with stone. Bless him with steel.
what is dead may never die.
what is dead may never die... But rises again harder and stronger.
stand.
I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf.
if Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?
no, afraid not. Sorry about that.
and Harrenhal-- I suppose that's off the table as well.
Yes, I fear so.
sorry about that, too.
leave me out of your next deception.
Oh, that's a shame.
you were to be the centerpiece of my next deception.
my brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.
I would see him released.
that's where you come in.
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
no, he won't.
but his mother might.
how would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
find him?
Oh, aye. And he has company.
filthy old stoat.
almost hate to interrupt.
no, you don't.
no, I don't.
what is the meaning of this?
no, please, please.
you disappoint me, Grand Maester.
I am your loyal servant.
so loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
No! Never!
it's a falsehood.
I swear it.
it wasn't me.
Ah, Varys.
it was Varys the spider.
see, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.
I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.
I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.
no one but you.
the eunuch has spies everywhere.
cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
no, no, no.
there are no goats, halfman.
well, make do.
how long have you been spying for my sister?
all I did, I did for House Lannister.
always. Your lord father, ask him.
I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
I don't like his beard.
what? What?
Oh, no. No.
how many hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?
Eddard Stark?
jon Arryn?
lord Arryn, he knew.
he knew the truth about the queen.
and, well, he planned to act, to tell King Robert.
so you poisoned him?
no.
never.
but you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
Lannister - I always served Lannister.
get him out of my sight.
throw him in one of the black cells.
Oh, no. No, no, no. No, please.
don't! You can't do this to me!
for your trouble.
you'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
good.
one of my better ideas.
and it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell.
well played, My Lord Hand.
but should I be worried?
Janos Slynt, Pycelle-- the small council grows smaller every day.
the council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.
I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
power is a curious thing, My Lord.
are you fond of riddles?
why, am I about to hear one?
three great men sit in a room.
a king, a priest and a rich man.
between them stands a common Sellsword.
each great man bids the Sellsword kill the other two.
who lives, who dies?
depends on the Sellsword.
does it?
he has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the Gods.
he has a sword, the power of life and death.
but if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend Kings hold all the power?
when Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible?
Joffrey?
the executioner?
or something else?
I've decided I don't like riddles.
power resides where men believe it resides.
it's a trick, a shadow on the wall.
and a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
you should be sleeping.
tomorrow's a long march.
30 miles if it don't piss on us.
I can't sleep.
I don't like the taste.
well... You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest.
what?
how do you sleep?
same as most men, I think.
but you've seen things, horrible things.
Aye.
I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
how do you sleep when you
when you have those things in your head?
you didn't see that.
I made damn sure.
I close my eyes and I see them up there.
all of them standing there
Joffrey, the Queen, and
you know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that?
I must have been a couple of years older than you.
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep.
he weren't much of a villain what skewered him.
Willem, the lad's name was.
he ran off before anyone could spit.
and I just stood there, watching my brother die.
but here's the funny part.
I can't picture my brother's face anymore.
but Willem-- oh, he was a nice-looking boy.
he had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.
I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit.
it got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.
Willem. Willem. Willem.
a prayer almost.
well, one day...
willem came riding back into town.
I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull, they had to bury him with it.
willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since.
well... that'll help you sleep, eh?
get up, you lazy sons of whores!
arm yourselves.
get up.
keep out of sight, both of you.
no, I'm not afraid. - I can fight.
keep out of sight.
if things go wrong, you run.
do you hear me?
you run along North and don't look back.
Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses.
outside, now!
come on, move, move!
everyone out!
Hey, you!
open the damn cage!
Where's the bastard, Crow?
got more than a few bastards here.
who's asking?
ser Amory Lorch, sworn Bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.
these men from the capital requested our assistance.
drop your weapons in the name of the King.
now, which King would that be?
this is your last chance.
in the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
I don't think I will.
so be it.
I always hated crossbows.
take too long to load.
boy, come here.
boy!
sweet boy, help us.
come back here! Help us, boy!
a man can fight!
free us!
quick, give it to me.
give me the ax.
what do we have here?
No!
that's a fine little blade.
maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
I yield! I yield!
round up any survivors.
we'll take them back to Harrenhal.
you heard him. You're coming with us.
I yield!
help!
help me!
something wrong with your leg, boy?
look at it.
can you walk?
no.
you got to carry me.
all right.
carry him, he says.
we're looking for a bastard named Gendry.
give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
you want Gendry?
you already got him.
he loved that helmet.
you'll give the Starks our reply, cousin? I will, Your Grace.
did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest?
I did.
tell him he's not been forgotten.
I'll do it. Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it.
be quick about it.
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
all of you should do as he commands. Betray me and you will wish you hadn't.
all hail the king.
who threw that?
get back!
you're all right now, little bird. You're all right.
your brothers desert you?
we'll stop here. - Think they're out looking for you?
Yes.
what might this be? Let's go.
amory Lorch. Now!
a man will do what must be done.
guard!
I have something for you from Prince Theon.
when I came to this city, I had nothing.
today I am the richest man in Qarth with no regrets.
where are they? Where are my dragons?!
a cripple?
you let a cripple escape?
the boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
the giant must have took him.
the giant?
Oh, well, that's all right, then.
you let a halfwit escape with a cripple.
and Rickon, too? The little one?
gone along with the wildling woman, the one you were fucking.
right, get the horses and the hounds.
come on, find the scent.
come on, where they going?
Halt!
enjoying your first hunt?
so far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord.
with hunting, there's blood at the end. They're little boys.
I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.
so I kept my word. I never ran away.
if I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.
well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.
those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
they have no value to me missing.
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.
she'll get here long before they do.
and Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell against 10, 000.
we have a scent!
the hounds have the scent.
come, Maester, don't look so grim.
it's all just a game.
we should have took more food.
we couldn't risk going to the kitchens. Those people all love you.
they would have given you whatever you needed.
and if Theon found out, he'd hang them.
the boy can't survive on walnuts. - I'm fine.
we've been walking since before sunrise.
even Hodor will tire. - Hodor.
even you, sweet giant. - Hodor.
wait, I know that farm.
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
Jack and Billy.
they'll give us some food. We can't risk it.
if Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
you've never seen me climb a tree, little man. They'll be after us with hounds.
we got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.
did you pull a knife on me in the night?
what's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's ass.
let's move.
Oh, it is the first time.
how old are you, boy?
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
you're a boy who's never been with a girl.
don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
don't call them that.
what, stones?
or bone?
neither.
both.
move!
I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them.
of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them.
as if I'd feel sorry for them.
are there no girl crows?
there are no women of the Night's Watch, no.
so the lads just do it with each other?
no.
never? - Never.
we swore an oath.
you have sheep at the Wall?
with your hands, then?
no wonder you're all so miserable.
would you please shut up? Would you please shut up?
you think you're better than me, crow.
I'm a free woman- - You're a free woman?
I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.
if you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman.
that's what "prisoner" means. And you think you're free?
you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
it was my choice to say the words.
so you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls.
but you chose never to touch them.
that's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
so instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands
invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time.
some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!
they're not your lands! We've been here the whole time.
you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
my father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men.
my ancestors lived here, same as yours.
so why are you fighting us?
go on.
now I want you to tell me what happened.
come on, this way.
come on, speak up. Speak up.
Wolfsbane。
a rare substance.
this is no common assassin.
we hanged 20 men last night.
I don't care if you hanged 100.
a man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
we think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
pretentious name for a band of outlaws.
we can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.
we look like fools and they look like heroes.
that's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.
killing them isn't the problem.
it's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane?
I always thought you had a talent for violence.
burn the villages, burn the farms.
let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
is that mutton?
Yes, My Lord. Don't like mutton.
I'll bring something else.
leave it.
are you hungry? - No.
of course you are.
eat.
I'll eat in the kitchen later.
it's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer.
sit.
eat.
you're small for your age.
I suppose you've been underfed your whole life. -I eat a lot.
I just don't grow. - Hmm.
this will be my last war, win or lose.
have you ever lost before?
do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
but this is the one I'll be remembered for.
the "War of Five Kings" they're calling it.
my legacy will be determined in the coming months.
do you know what legacy means?
it's what you pass down to your children and your children's children.
it's what remains of you when you're gone.
Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.
the greatest fortress ever built.
the tallest towers, the strongest walls.
the Great Hall had 35 hearths.
35. Can you imagine?
look at it now.
a blasted ruin.
do you know what happened?
dragons?
Yes, dragons happened.
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.
a million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled.
but an attack from the air with dragon fire- mm.
Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.
that's why every child alive still knows his name 300 years after his death.
Aegon and his sisters.
it wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.
it was Rhaenys and Visenya, too. Correct.
a student of history, are you?
Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.
she had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
she's a heroine of yours, I take it?
aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?
jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
most girls are idiots. - Ha!
you remind me of my daughter.
where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?
from my father.
he was a well-read stonemason.
can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
have you met many stonemasons, My Lord?
careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful.
take that back to the kitchen.
eat what you want.
and, girl.
m'lord.
lowborn girls say "M'lord,
not "My Lord.
if you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
my mother served Lady Dustin for many years, My Lord.
she taught me how to speak proper- properly.
you're too smart for your own good.
has anyone told you that? - Yes.
go on.
I beg pardon, Ser.
I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me.
you were so brave. - Brave?
a dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
does it give you joy to scare people?
no. It gives me joy to kill people.
spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
it was his duty. He never liked it.
is that what he told you?
he lied.
killing is the sweetest thing there is.
why are you always so hateful?
you'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
one of them did this or knows who did. You are one of the Thirteen.
if I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them.
they mean nothing to me on their own. - Nothing?
they're more valuable than anything in the world.
shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already?
we will get them back.
there is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.
a man is what others say he is and no more.
if they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing.
I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
but it did happen under your roof.
Khaleesi, many times in my life I have been
I don't care where you've been.
you think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.
we can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but...
we're free.
if someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his ass.
we don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
no. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
we chose Mance Rayder to lead us.
he was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free.
you could be free, too.
you don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men.
wake up when you want to wake up.
I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.
build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
you're a pretty lad.
the girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
walk.
I could teach you how to do it.
I know how to do it.
you know nothing, Jon Snow.
and what did she say?
she admired your spirit, Your Grace.
and what then?
she, uh...
if every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
she tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
you've acted with honor. I thank you for it.
lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean.
and give him a hot supper. Ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.
the prisoners from the Yellow Fork. Too many prisoners.
is there room for Ser Alton?
does he need to lie down?
have the men build him a new pen.
put him in with the Kingslayer for now.
have your boy watch over them.
that will be all.
your Grace. A minute of your time?
I've been treating your wounded men.
and my enemies as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
they're not my enemies. That's what I tell my bannermen.
I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.
some are easily replaced- egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.
but some are not.
I need silk for stitching.
I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.
mostly I need milk of the poppy.
you saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.
I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
if you need help finding these- - I know where to find them.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.
continue, My Lady.
you're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
Yes.
the Crag will have a Maester and he will have what I need.
I expect he will. If I could write a list
come with me to the Crag.
I don't think that will be- Let the Maester show you his stores.
I want the wounded men to be treated well
all the wounded men.
children, come inside, quick.
hurry up!
can't find anything, Ser.
they've lost the scent. - Try again.
we've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
we could start the search fresh in the morning, My Lord.
I'm looking at spending the rest of life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.
ask yourself, "Is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening?
the hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.
I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.
and once I've got them, the pampered little shits...
it's better to be cruel than weak.
prince Theon.
where are they? - Who, m'lord?
the Stark boys. Where are they? I don't know. I seen no one.
think harder.
I swear, m'lord, I don't know.
my Lord, over here.
I think I've found what we're looking for.
send the old man home.
go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
Theon, don't do this.
you came back. As soon as I heard.
do you know anything?
irri is dead. - I know.
she was a good- - she's dead.
she died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
Doreah? We can't find her.
she must be dead, too.
I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
I should have been here.
you went to find me a ship.
my place is by your side.
I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
these people? They are not to be trusted.
and who is to be trusted?
who are my people? The Targaryens?
I only knew one- my brother, and he would have let 1, 000 men rape me if it had got him the crown.
the Dothraki?
most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
your people are in Westeros.
the people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
they will soon enough. - And then what?
they'll pray for my return?
they'll wave dragon banners and shout my name?
that's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
you are not your brother.
trust me, Khaleesi.
there it is
trust me.
and it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah?
only you?
I don't need trust any longer.
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.
you are too young to be so- And you are too familiar.
forgive me, Khaleesi.
no one can survive in this world without help.
no one.
let me help you, please.
tell me how.
find my dragons.
how long till we get back to your crows?
we're close.
what, a day? A half-day?
you don't know, do you?
do you even know where they are? - We're close.
what do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
nothing happened between you and me.
I swear it, old master king crow, Ser, we were only close together for warmth.
and then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club.
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.
and before I knew what was where, his- his
well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.
and I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did!
and he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it.
now I can never marry a perfumed lord.
what will me poor savage father say? - Turn back around.
and I thought that we were done, but he said, 'Turn back around. '
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow, since it's going to be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just.
what, right here in the muck? I'll keep you warm enough.
are you that afraid of it?
that's enough.
Oh, it's nice and wet and warm.
enough it don't have teeth.
all right!
all right.
gods, you're dull.
should have took me while you had the chance.
no, no!
no. Oh, no.
it's all right. Give me that.
if the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now...
help me flip it over.
where are you going? - To tell her Grace.
you'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
your mother might have prepared you.
you flowered, my dear. No more.
my mother told me, but I thought it would be different.
in what way?
I thought it would be less
less messy.
wait until you bear the child.
you're a woman now.
do you have any idea what that means?
I'm fit to bear children for the king?
a prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.
Joffrey has always been difficult.
even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world.
you cannot imagine the pain.
I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
his Grace was not with you?
robert was hunting. That was his custom.
whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.
and when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby.
not that I wanted him there, mind you.
I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother.
when they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
you may never love the king, but you will love his children.
I love his Grace with all my heart.
that's so very touching to hear.
permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
the more people you love, the weaker you are.
you'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.
you'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.
love no one but your children.
on that front, a mother has no choice.
but... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
you can try, little dove.
who did you say your mother was again?
is she the fat one?
well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she...
no, no. There's only one fat Lannister.
if she was your mother, you'd know it.
I- I squired for you once, you know?
when?
the tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding.
I went to Willem Frey's wedding? You did.
your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he...
he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds.
what was his name? - Bryan.
poor lad.
that was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.
I remember you.
you had never squired for anyone before.
that's right. I ran up and volunteered.
let me, My Lord. Let me.
my father was furious, afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the family.
you didn't, though.
you really remember? - Mm.
you knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent.
most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.
well, when I think back to that day
you were saying?
I...
never mind. It's embarrassing.
more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
I remember everything about that day your helmet, your horse, the rake line in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
I'll remember it all until I die.
that was the best day of my life.
and I remember being on the field after it was over.
all the competitors were done. I was the last one out there.
and I couldn't leave.
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride.
and I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
I understand completely.
how could you?
s- sorry, I- I didn't mean to doubt you.
it's just that I- - I was 16 once.
I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
which knight was it?
the fight against the Kingswood outlaws.
before your time. What was he like?
he was a painter, a painter who only used red.
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then.
and to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect...
I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.
it's hard to put into words.
it's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
did you squire for him again? - No.
I didn't have your gift.
he couldn't take a step without stepping on me.
I was awful, a complete liability...until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.
it's a good thing I am who I am.
I'd have been useless at anything else.
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.
shocking, I know. Some men are.
Ned Stark- I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.
but me, though- my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
have you thought about...? Of course.
every day. - And?
good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.
the Starks are very careful.
but there is a way, I think.
it wasn't possible until now.
what is it?
it's actually quite simple. - Well, let me help you.
you'll only have to do one thing.
tell me.
you'll have to die.
Jorah the Andal.
this man must sail past old Valyria.
all who travel too close to the Doom must have protection.
I didn't come here for lessons.
no, you came for the dragons.
you have them?
where are they? Draw your sword.
see what your steel is worth.
you want to please the Mother of Dragons.
you love her.
where are the dragons?
will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
will you betray her again?
never.
the thief you seek is with her now.
I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
no one is calling you a thief. Who is she to accuse us?
please, they're my children.
I'm begging you. - Begging us?
it wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
without me, the dragons will die.
it will be for the best.
your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear.
if I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
you are cruel, my friend. The mother of dragons is in the right.
she must be reunited with her babies.
I will help you, Khaleesi. - How?
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
you have my dragons?
when I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.
he procured them for me.
but there is no King of Qarth. - There is now.
that was the other half of the arrangement.
you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
your ambition is an inspiration.
but like all upstarts, you overreach.
three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.
an upstart and a charlatan?
empires have been built by less.
those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
the Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.
she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side...forever.
a mother should be with her children.
where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?
your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
come see them.
lady Stark! - No farther.
keep your hands off me, woman.
don't enter without an invitation, man.
forgive me. Lady Stark.
what is it? - They caught the Kingslayer.
kill the fucking Kingslayer! - Hang him!
you'll die today.
justice for the Karstark.
gut him!
get back! I want his head!
any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.
this monster killed my son. And crippled mine.
he will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.
I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
you will strike me down?
have you forgotten me, Ser?
I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark.
I am the mother of your king!
and where is our king now? - You know very well.
he has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.
aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.
he brought that foreign bitch with him. How dare you?
threatening My Lady is an act of treason.
treason?
how can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
I understand your grief, My Lord, better than most I understand it, but in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.
when your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.
wise men do not make demands of kings.
fathers who love their sons do.
I will have his head.
thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.
I would have come to your defense, but...
take him to the stockades.
bind him with every chain you can find!
you've become a real she-wolf in your later years.
there's not much fish left in you. And gag him!
since when do you light your own candles?
since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
how many times can you read one raven scroll?
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth- 200 ships.
more than we have. - Yes, that's more than we have.
he'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
we have strong, high walls.
we'll rain fire down on them from above.
rain fire on them from above.
you're quoting father, aren't you? Why not?
he has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?
we call it tactics, not strategy.
but, yes, he does have a good mind for it.
the best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here.
it's just you, me, and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm.
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
he needs to start acting like a king.
this war you started is coming to our doorstep.
and if the entire city wants Joffrey dead- I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
I thought the girls might help him.
did you? - I was wrong.
if we can't control him...
do you think I haven't tried?
he doesn't listen to me.
it's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.
he looks like him...in a certain light.
the boy is more Robert than Jaime.
robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.
sometimes I wonder...
what?
if this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.
sins? The Targaryens
wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know.
that's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.
it's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.
half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?
what's the saying?
every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.
you've beaten the odds.
Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
why wait? - We're sworn to the king.
there's not a king. - That's treason.
so is saving Lannisters, yeah?
back off, you. - No, I won't.
your son returns at dawn, My Lady? So they say.
the Kingslayer won't last the night.
the more they drink, the angrier they'll get.
and when the Karstarks draw their swords...who wants to die defending a Lannister?
come.
I need to be alone with him.
my Lady, our orders- - your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?
I believe it's my last night in this world.
is that a woman?
do you hear them out there?
they want your head.
well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
you strangled his son with your chains.
was he the one on guard duty?
he was in my way.
any Knight would have done the same. You are no Knight.
you have forsaken every vow you ever took. So many vows.
they make you swear and swear.
defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.
but what if your father despises the king?
what if the king massacres the innocent?
it's too much.
no matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.
where did you find this beast?
she is a truer Knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer. Kingslayer.
what a king he was.
here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
you are a man without honor.
do you know I've never been with any woman but Cersei?
so in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.
what was the name of that bastard so in he fathered?
Brienne. - No, that wasn't it.
snow, a bastard from the North.
now, when- when good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it?
no. You're not very good at pretending.
you're an honest woman.
you hated that boy, didn't you?
how could you not hate him?
the walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark fucked another woman.
your sword.
I told you what would happen.
all of you
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally...
and what would happen if you did not.
what are you doing?
what have you done? -If there's any who still question whether your new lord means what he says...here is the answer to your question.
No!
from this time until the end of time, we are the free and independent Kingdom of the North.
you'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
I will, Your Grace.
did you see my brother when you were the Starks' guest?
I did.
tell him he's not been forgotten.
I'll do it.
come, brothers. We'll leave him to it.
be quick about it.
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
all of you should do as he commands.
betray me and you will wish you hadn't.
all hail the king.
who threw that?
get back!
you're all right now, little bird. You're all right.
your brothers desert you?
we'll stop here. - Think they're out looking for you?
Yes.
what might this be? Let's go.
amory Lorch. Now!
a man will do what must be done.
guard!
I have something for you from Prince Theon.
when I came to this city, I had nothing.
today I am the richest man in Qarth with no regrets.
where are they? Where are my dragons?!
a cripple?
you let a cripple escape?
the boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
the giant must have took him.
the giant? Hodor?
Oh, well, that's all right, then.
you let a halfwit escape with a cripple.
and Rickon, too? The little one?
gone along with the wildling woman, the one you were fucking.
right, get the horses and the hounds.
come on, find the scent.
come on, where they going?
Halt!
enjoying your first hunt?
so far, hunting seems very similar to riding, My Lord.
with hunting, there's blood at the end.
they're little boys.
I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.
so I kept my word. I never ran away.
if I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them.
well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.
those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
they have no value to me missing.
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte.
she'll get here long before they do.
and Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell against 10, 000.
we have a scent!
the hounds have the scent.
come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.
we should have took more food.
we couldn't risk going to the kitchens.
those people all love you. They would have given you whatever you needed.
and if Theon found out, he'd hang them.
the boy can't survive on walnuts. - I'm fine.
we've been walking since before sunrise.
even Hodor will tire. - Hodor.
even you, sweet giant. - Hodor.
wait, I know that farm.
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
Jack and Billy. They'll give us some food.
we can't risk it.
if Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
you've never seen me climb a tree, little man.
they'll be after us with hounds.
we got a good start on them, but we can't outrun hounds forever.
did you pull a knife on me in the night?
what's the matter?
can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's ass.
let's move.
Oh, it is the first time.
how old are you, boy?
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
you're a boy who's never been with a girl.
don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
don't call them that.
what, stones?
or bone?
neither.
both.
move!
I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them.
of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them.
as if I'd feel sorry for them.
are there no girl crows?
there are no women of the Night's Watch, no.
so the lads just do it with each other?
no.
never? - Never.
we swore an oath.
you have sheep at the Wall?
with your hands, then?
no wonder you're all so miserable.
would you please shut up? - Would you please shut up?
you think you're better than me, crow.
I'm a free woman-- - You're a free woman?
I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.
if you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.
and you think you're free?
you swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
it was my choice to say the words.
so you don't like girls? - Of course I like girls.
but you chose never to touch them.
that's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
so instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands.
invade your lands?
wildlings raid our lands all the time.
some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!
they're not your lands! We've been here the whole time.
you lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
my father was Ned Stark.
I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.
so why are you fighting us?
go on.
now I want you to tell me what happened.
come on, this way.
come on, speak up. Speak up.
Wolfsbane--a rare substance.
this is no common assassin.
we hanged 20 men last night.
I don't care if you hanged 100.
a man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
we think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
pretentious name for a band of outlaws.
we can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.
we look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall.
I want them dead, every one.
killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them.
have you gone soft, Clegane?
I always thought you had a talent for violence.
burn the villages, burn the farms.
let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
is that mutton? - Yes, My Lord.
don't like mutton.
I'll bring something else.
leave it.
are you hungry? - No.
of course you are.
eat. - I'll eat in the kitchen later.
it's bad manners to refuse a Lord's offer.
sit.
eat.
you're small for your age.
I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
this will be my last war, win or lose.
have you ever lost before?
do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
but this is the one I'll be remembered for.
the "War of Five Kings" they're calling it.
my legacy will be determined in the coming months.
do you know what legacy means?
it's what you pass down to your children and your children's children.
it's what remains of you when you're gone.
Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.
the greatest fortress ever built
the tallest towers, the strongest walls.
the Great Hall had 35 hearths.
35. Can you imagine?
look at it now--a blasted ruin.
do you know what happened?
dragons?
Yes, dragons happened.
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.
a million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled.
but an attack from the air with dragon fire
Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.
that's why every child alive still knows his name 300 years after his death.
Aegon and his sisters.
it wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon.
it was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
correct. A student of history, are you?
Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.
she had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
she's a heroine of yours, I take it?
aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?
jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
most girls are idiots.
you remind me of my daughter.
where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian Steel sword?
from my father.
he was a well-read stonemason.
can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
have you met many stonemasons, My Lord?
careful now, girl.
I enjoy you, but be careful.
take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.
and, girl.
m'lord.
lowborn girls say "M'lord,"not "My Lord.
if you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
my mother served Lady Dustin for many years, My Lord.
she taught me how to speak proper-- properly.
you're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
Yes. - Go on.
I beg pardon, Ser.
I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me.
you were so brave. - Brave?
a dog doesn't need courage to chase off rats.
does it give you joy to scare people?
no. It gives me joy to kill people.
spare me. You can't tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
it was his duty. He never liked it.
is that what he told you? He lied.
killing is the sweetest thing there is.
why are you always so hateful?
you'll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you're queen and I'm all that stands between you and your beloved king.
I've demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
one of them did this or knows who did. - You are one of the Thirteen.
if I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them.
they mean nothing to me on their own. - Nothing?
they're more valuable than anything in the world.
shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already?
we will get them back.
there is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.
a man is what others say he is and no more.
if they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing.
I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
but it did happen under your roof.
Khaleesi, many times in my life I have been...
I don't care where you've been.
you think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles.
we can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but...
we're free.
if someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his ass.
we don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.
no. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King-Beyond-the-Wall.
we chose Mance Rayder to lead us.
he was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free.
you could be free, too.
you don't need to live your whole life taking commands from old men.
wake up when you want to wake up.
I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.
build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
you're a pretty lad.
the girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.
walk.
I could teach you how to do it.
I know how to do it.
you know nothing, Jon Snow.
and what did she say?
she admired your spirit, Your Grace.
and what then?
she, uh...
if every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.
she tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
you've acted with honor. I thank you for it.
lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean.
and give him a hot supper.
ser Alton's pen is occupied, Your Grace.
the prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
too many prisoners.
is there room for Ser Alton?
does he need to lie down?
have the men build him a new pen.
put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
Torrhen.
that will be all.
your Grace. A minute of your time?
I've been treating your wounded men.
and my enemies as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
they're not my enemies. - That's what I tell my bannermen.
I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.
some are easily replaced--egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.
but some are not.
I need silk for stitching.
I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.
mostly I need milk of the poppy.
you saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.
I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
if you need help finding these-- - I know where to find them.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.
continue, My Lady.
you're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
Yes.
the Crag will have a Maester and he will have what I need.
I expect he will.
if I could write a list - come with me to the Crag.
I don't think that will be
let the Maester show you his stores.
I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.
children, come inside, quick.
hurry up!
can't find anything, Ser.
they've lost the scent. - Try again.
we've circled this farmhouse twice. There's no sign of them.
we could start the search fresh in the morning, My Lord.
I'm looking at spending the rest of life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.
ask yourself,"Is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening?
the hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do.
I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.
and once I've got them, the pampered little shits...
it's better to be cruel than weak.
prince Theon.
where are they? - Who, m'lord?
the Stark boys. Where are they?
I don't know. I seen no one.
think harder.
I swear, m'lord, I don't know.
my Lord, over here.
I think I've found what we're looking for.
send the old man home.
go back to Winterfell.
take him back.
Theon, don't do this.
you came back.
as soon as I heard.
do you know anything?
irri is dead. - I know.
she was a good-- - she's dead.
she died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
Doreah?
we can't find her.
she must be dead, too.
I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
I should have been here.
you went to find me a ship.
my place is by your side.
I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
these people? - They are not to be trusted.
and who is to be trusted?
who are my people? The Targaryens?
I only knew one-- my brother, and he would have let 1, 000 men rape me if it had got him the crown.
the Dothraki?
most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
your people are in Westeros.
the people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
they will soon enough. - And then what?
they'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name?
that's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
you are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi.
there it is--"trust me.
and it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you?
I don't need trust any longer.
I don't want it and I don't have room for it.
you are too young to be so - And you are too familiar.
forgive me, Khaleesi.
no one can survive in this world without help. No one.
let me help you, please. Tell me how.
find my dragons.
how long till we get back to your crows?
we're close.
what, a day? A half-day?
you don't know, do you?
do you even know where they are? - We're close.
what do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?
nothing happened between you and me.
I swear it, old master king crow, Ser, we were only close together for warmth.
and then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club.
I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.
and before I knew what was where, his-- his
well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.
and I didn't want to want it, but, oh, I did!
and he spread me legs and-- ruined.
the shame of it.
now I can never marry a perfumed lord.
what will me poor savage father say?
turn back around.
and I thought that we were done, but he said,'Turn back around.'
I'll tell you what, Jon Snow, since it's going to be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just.
what, right here in the muck?
I'll keep you warm enough.
are you that afraid of it?
that's enough.
Oh, it's nice and wet and warm.
enough it don't have teeth.
all right!
all right.
gods, you're dull.
should have took me while you had the chance.
no, no!
no. Oh, no.
it's all right. Give me that.
if the queen sees I can have Joffrey's children now...
help me flip it over.
where are you going? - To tell her Grace.
you'll say nothing to anyone. Do you understand?
your mother might have prepared you.
you flowered, my dear. No more.
my mother told me, but I thought it would be different.
in what way?
I thought it would be less--less messy.
wait until you bear the child.
you're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
I'm fit to bear children for the king?
a prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.
Joffrey has always been difficult.
even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world.
you cannot imagine the pain.
I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
his Grace was not with you?
robert was hunting.
that was his custom.
whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.
and when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby.
not that I wanted him there, mind you.
I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother.
when they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
you may never love the king, but you will love his children.
I love his Grace with all my heart.
that's so very touching to hear.
permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
the more people you love, the weaker you are.
you'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do.
you'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.
love no one but your children.
on that front, a mother has no choice.
but... shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
you can try, little dove.
who did you say your mother was again?
cinda Lannister.
is she the fat one?
well, perhaps she's gotten a little larger than she
no, no. There's only one fat Lannister.
if she was your mother, you'd know it.
I-- I squired for you once, you know?
when?
the tournament the day of Willem Frey's wedding.
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
you did.
your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he
he threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds.
what was his name? - Bryan.
poor lad.
that was my brother's doing, I seem to recall.
I remember you.
you had never squired for anyone before.
that's right. I ran up and volunteered."Let me, My Lord. Let me."
my father was furious, afraid I'd embarrass our family in front of the family.
you didn't, though.
you really remember?
you knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent.
most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.
well, when I think back to that day
you were saying?
never mind. It's embarrassing.
more embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake line in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
I'll remember it all until I die.
that was the best day of my life.
and I remember being on the field after it was over.
all the competitors were done. I was the last one out there.
and I couldn't leave.
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride.
and I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
I understand completely.
how could you?
S-Sorry, I-- I didn't mean to doubt you. It's just that I
I was 16 once.
I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
which knight was it?
Barristan Selmy.
the fight against the Kingswood outlaws. Before your time.
what was he like?
he was a painter, a painter who only used red.
I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then.
and to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect...
I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.
it's hard to put into words.
it's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
did you squire for him again? - No.
I didn't have your gift.
he couldn't take a step without stepping on me.
I was awful, a complete liability...
until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire.
it's a good thing I am who I am.
I'd have been useless at anything else.
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know.
some men are. Ned Stark
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.
but me, though-- my life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
have you thought about...?
of course. Every day.
And?
good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.
the Starks are very careful.
but there is a way, I think.
it wasn't possible until now.
what is it?
it's actually quite simple. - Well, let me help you.
you'll only have to do one thing.
tell me.
you'll have to die.
Jorah the Andal.
this man must sail past old Valyria.
all who travel too close to the Doom must have protection.
I didn't come here for lessons.
no, you came for the dragons.
you have them?
where are they?
draw your sword.
see what your steel is worth.
you want to please the Mother of Dragons.
you love her.
where are the dragons?
will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
will you betray her again?
never.
the thief you seek is with her now.
I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
no one is calling you a thief.
who is she to accuse us?
please, they are my children. I'm begging you.
begging us? It wasn't very long ago you were threatening us.
without me, the dragons will die.
it will be for the best.
your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear.
if I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
you are cruel, my friend.
the mother of dragons is in the right.
she must be reunited with her babies.
I will help you, Khaleesi. - How?
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
you have my dragons?
when I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.
he procured them for me.
but there is no King of Qarth. - There is now.
that was the other half of the arrangement.
you would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
your ambition is an inspiration.
but like all upstarts, you overreach.
three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.
an upstart and a charlatan?
empires have been built by less.
those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
the Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.
she will give them her love and they will thrive by her side...forever.
a mother should be with her children.
where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?
your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
come see them.
lady Stark! - No farther.
keep your hands off me, woman.
don't enter without an invitation, man.
forgive me. Lady Stark.
what is it? - They caught the Kingslayer.
kill the fucking Kingslayer! - Hang him!
you'll die today.
justice for the Karstark.
gut him!
get back! I want his head!
any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.
this monster killed my son.
and crippled mine.
he will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.
I will have his head. And if you try and stop me
you will strike me down?
have you forgotten me, Ser?
I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddark Stark. I am the mother of your king!
and where is our king now? - You know very well.
he has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.
aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.
he brought that foreign bitch with him.
how dare you?
threatening My Lady is an act of treason.
treason? How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
I understand your grief, My Lord--better than most I understand it, but in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.
when your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head.
wise men do not make demands of kings.
fathers who love their sons do. I will have his head.
thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.
I would have come to your defense, but
take him to the stockades.
bind him with every chain you can find!
you've become a real she-wolf in your later years.
there's not much fish left in you. - And gag him!
since when do you light your own candles?
since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
how many times can you read one raven scroll?
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth-- 200 ships.
more than we have. - Yes, that's more than we have.
he'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
we have strong, high walls.
we'll rain fire down on them from above.
rain fire on them from above."You're quoting father, aren't you?
why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?
we call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.
the best mind, some would say.
sadly, he's not here.
it's just you, me, and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm.
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
he needs to start acting like a king.
this war you started is coming to our doorstep.
and if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
I thought the girls might help him.
did you? - I was wrong.
if we can't control him...
do you think I haven't tried?
he doesn't listen to me.
it's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.
he looks like him...in a certain light.
the boy is more Robert than Jaime.
robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty.
sometimes I wonder...
what?
if this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.
sins?
the Targaryens
wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know.
that's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.
it's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.
half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they?
what's the saying?
every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.
you've beaten the odds.
Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
why wait? - We're sworn to the king.
there's not a king. - That's treason.
so is saving Lannisters, yeah?
back off, you. - No, I won't.
your son returns at dawn, My Lady?
so they say.
the Kingslayer won't last the night.
the more they drink, the angrier they'll get.
and when the Karstarks draw their swords...who wants to die defending a Lannister?
come.
I need to be alone with him.
my Lady, our orders your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?
I believe it's my last night in this world.
is that a woman?
do you hear them out there? They want your head.
well, old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
you strangled his son with your chains.
was he the one on guard duty?
he was in my way.
any Knight would have done the same.
you are no Knight.
you have forsaken every vow you ever took.
so many vows. They make you swear and swear.
defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.
but what if your father despises the king?
what if the king massacres the innocent?
it's too much.
no matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another.
where did you find this beast?
she is a truer Knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.
Kingslayer.
what a king he was.
here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
you are a man without honor.
do you know I've never been with any woman but Cersei?
so in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned.
what was the name of that bastard so in he fathered?
Brienne. - No, that wasn't it.
snow, a bastard from the North.
now, when-- when good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it?
no. You're not very good at pretending.
you're an honest woman.
you hated that boy, didn't you?
how could you not hate him?
the walking, talking remminder that the honorable Lord Eddark Stark fucked another woman.
your sword.
I told you what would happen.
all of you
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally...and what would happen if you did not.
what are you doing? What have you done?
if there's any who still question whether your new lord means what he says...
here is the answer to your question.
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here.
and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.
inform her that she's to bring 500 men to Winterfell.
when do we sail for King's Landing? Soon as I've consolidated my troops.
and you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
the fist of the First Men. Thousands of years ago the First Men stood here.
they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
do you really think I'll let you ship Myrcella off to Dorne?
Dorne is the safest place for her.
I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone before I take her from you.
you let a halfwit escape with a cripple?
and Rickon, too? The little one?
gone, along with the wildling woman. Wait, I know that farm.
they'll give us some food. - We can't risk it.
I've been treating your wounded men.
I've already run through the supplies I brought with me.
you're riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender.
come with me to the Crag. Let the Maester show you his stores.
should have took me while you had the chance.
they want your head. Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
you strangled his son with your chains.
he was in my way. - You are a man without honor.
Brienne, your sword.
you have my dragons?
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally and what would happen if you did not. What have you done?
if there are any among you who still question whether your new lord means what he says...
No!
rider approaching! - Open the gate!
why, it's the Prince of Winterfell.
envy isn't attractive. - What envy?
you should be proud of your brother's achievement.
I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.
you're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates.
which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?
I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery.
you treated them with honor by butchering them?
before I had to kill them, I treated them
you seized their home, as is your right.
we're Ironborn; We take what we need. - Exactly.
then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.
is that treachery?
I'd call it bravery. They made me a promise
your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it?
are you the dumbest cunt alive?
don't call me a- - A cunt.
a dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.
you know how valuable those boys were?
if I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.
you are weak. And you're stupid.
I'm warning you.
go on, then, warn me.
you haven't brought enough men.
how am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
you're not. I've come to bring you home.
father wants a word. - Is this a joke?
Winterfell is the heart of the North.
aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.
we're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that?
our power comes from our ships.
and now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged.
when Robb Stark finds out
he won't find out. We've killed all the ravens.
we have all the horses.
I've taken Winterfell.
and I will keep Winterfell.
leave us.
Theon, you're my blood.
we both loved our mother.
we both endured our father.
come home with me. Don't die here alone.
I don't intend to die.
you were a terrible baby, do you know that?
bawling all the time, never sleeping.
and one night you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig.
I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.
I wanted to strangle you.
and you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.
you smiled at me.
don't die so far from the sea.
I've brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
I already got one crow. Don't need two.
mance will want to question this one.
knows all about where the crows are and what they're planning.
the Halfhand knows more. This one is just a little boy.
gut him.
he could have killed me half a dozen times.
and now he wishes he did. Gut him.
he's a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark's son.
mance will want him.
what does Mance want with a dead man's bastard?
I don't know.
I think he'll want to decide for himself.
he runs, I'll chop his balls off.
he runs, I'll do it meself.
we're even now, Jon Snow.
I couldn't do it. I had the sword at her neck, I just couldn't.
I know. - The others?
when you didn't come back, we went looking for you.
we found your tracks fast enough.
but they found us before we found you.
they died because of me.
see that it wasn't for nothing. All right, up, lad.
come on, on your feet, now.
move it.
is she beautiful?
I've never met her.
what's her name? Frey, I suppose.
I don't know her first name.
I'm sure you'll be very happy.
and you're marrying her for a bridge?
an important bridge. - Ah.
it was before they killed my father.
I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.
when I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.
he was the best man I ever met.
I know children always think that about their fathers, but
children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.
he once told me that being a Lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.
the farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect.
the charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.
the soldiers you order into battle.
he told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night.
I didn't believe him.
I asked him, "how can a man be brave if he's afraid?"
"that is the only time a man can be brave," he told me.
I wish I could have met him.
he would have liked you.
most Lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
he didn't care much about gold or glory.
and you?
you think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me?
I want to go home.
I want the men following me to go home. Then why don't you?
because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.
and because I believe in justice.
chopping off Joffrey's head, you mean.
that would be a start.
your Grace, Milady.
the Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
how?
how?!
tell me this isn't true.
Why?
for the girls. - You betrayed me.
Robb- - No!
you knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.
I have five children, and only one of them is free.
I lost one son fighting by your son's side.
I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
you commit treason because your children are prisoners?
I would carve out my heart and offer it to the father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
I grieve for your sons, My Lord.
I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance.
and you stole it from me.
killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
you've weakened our position.
you've brought discord into our camp.
and you did it all behind my back.
make sure she's guarded day and night. Robb.
how many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
40, Your Grace.
send another 40 with our fastest horses. Robb.
damn.
you're much uglier in daylight. What's your name?
I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.
a captive Knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
crescent moons and starbursts.
Lord... Selwyn Tarth, your father.
do you have any brothers and sisters, My Lady?
it's a long way to King's Landing.
might as well get to know one another.
have you known many men? I suppose not.
women?
horses? Ah!
I didn't mean to give offense, My Lady. Forgive me.
your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer. Why do you hate me so much?
have I ever harmed you? - You've harmed others those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.
has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
you will not provoke me to anger.
I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off.
do you think you could?
do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
I've never seen you fight. The answer is no.
there are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me.
you're not one of them.
all my life men like you have sneered at me.
and all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
if you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.
do you take me for an idiot? In.
I took you for a fighter, a man- pardon- woman of honor.
was I wrong?
you're afraid.
maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.
king's Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force.
it's not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
surrender the Iron Throne?
better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.
Stannis will execute them all.
no, a king who runs will not be king for long.
he's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight.
Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.
the scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap, which is why my son is his prisoner.
too close to Casterly Rock.
he sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell.
the Greyjoys have done us a great favor.
stark won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he's at full force.
he's a boy and he's never lost a battle.
he'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
we'll ride at nightfall.
I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move.
Clegane, you'll maintain a Garrison here at Harrenhal.
track down this brotherhood and destroy them.
the girl has proven herself a good servant.
she'll stay on with you.
see that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings.
he's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.
you've got some questions to answer.
who killed Ser Amory?
I don't know! - Give me the name.
please! - Take this one out for the crows.
I told you, I don't know.
please.
look, it's Yoren's little cunt.
used to be a boy, now it's a girl.
Where's Jaqen?
don't care.
Where's your stick now, bitch?
I promised to fuck you with it. Come on, time to kill some wolves.
you need sour cherries to make it right.
and the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet.
that's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine.
and then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
Where's Jaqen? - How would I know?
I need him now.
lord Tywin's marching tonight.
you need him? - He's helping me.
I saw him. - Where?
Where?! - Ow!
where?
they went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
on patrol. Let go of my ears.
what do you want with him anyway?
mance is gonna march on the Wall.
when he does, one brother inside his army will be worth 1, 000 fighting against it.
they'll never trust me. - They might...
if you do what needs to be done. - What?
how does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
I didn't. I should have known better, trusting a traitor's bastard.
he's not yours to kill, crow.
do you have to do that here?
I like to keep me hands clean.
Yes, but do you have to do it here?
you should start wearing the gold cloak. I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
you're commander of the City Watch.
you shouldn't be dressed like a common sellsword.
a cloak slows you down in a fight, makes it hard to move quietly.
and the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.
well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer.
you're supposed to stand out.
we had a deal, and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
fine, fine.
no gold cloak.
what? - What?
what? What? Why are you staring at me?
you don't want me cleaning me nails.
you don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
to help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
Stannis will be here any day.
and one of these explains how to beat him?
an History of the Great Sieges of Westeros by Archmaester "Shevelathin.
Chevalteesh.
I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
my Lord Hand, Commander.
I must compliment you on the Gold Cloaks' performance these last few weeks.
did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
I did not know.
and how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
for questioning?
uh, no.
it's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
we talked about this. - Aye, we talked about it.
have you ever been in a city under siege?
maybe this part's not in your books.
see, it's not the fighting that kills most people.
it's the starving. Food's worth more than gold.
noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.
things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.
the thieves, they love a siege.
soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.
by the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.
given the circumstances, My Lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.
the Great Sieges of Westeros.
thrilling subject.
shame Archmaester Ch'vyalthan wasn't a better writer.
Stannis knows King's Landing.
he knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest.
the mud gate.
a good ram will batter it down in minutes and it's only 50 yards from the water.
that's where he'll land.
and if Stannis does attack the mud gate, what is our plan?
we could throw books at his men. We don't have that many books.
we don't have that many men, either.
what do we have?
pig shit.
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
we're digging latrine pits at the end of the world.
I can't imagine anything much worse.
you lack imagination.
where do you think Jon is right now?
he went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back.
a betting man would go with dead.
he's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.
well, he's better than me and a lot better than you.
he's got a Valyrian steel sword.
so did his father.
and Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
great rangers never get old is the problem.
shit ones neither.
it's them in the middle that last a long time.
what in seven hells is that?
the First Men made these marks.
help me with it.
look.
if you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it.
that's a Night's Watch cloak. It's been here a long time.
Oh, must be Dragonglass.
Dragonglass?
the Maesters call it Obsidian.
why would a brother hide it here?
I expect it's 'cause he wanted somebody to find it.
mind where you're going.
I'm sorry. I'll
where were you? - A man has patrol duty.
Tywin Lannister was right here and now he's gone.
a girl owes one more name. The Red God demands it. Give the man a name.
how long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
a minute, an hour, a month.
death is certain, the time is not.
he's taking his army to attack my brother.
I need him dead right now.
this a man cannot do.
you promised you'd help me.
help was not promised, lovely girl.
only death. There must be others.
give a name, any name. And you'll kill them?
anybody?
by the seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.
all right.
a girl gives a man his own name?
that's right. - Gods are not mocked.
this is no joking thing. - I'm not joking.
a man can go kill himself.
un-name me. - No.
please?
I'll un-name you. Thank you.
if you help me and my friends escape.
this would require more than one life.
this is not part of our bargain. - Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.
a girl lacks honor.
if I do this thing, a girl must obey.
a girl will obey.
a girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
thank you, Podrick.
odd little boy.
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
you and Varys both.
excellent lamprey pie.
were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops.
the young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
he's only a boy.
younger boys are off fighting his war.
he's not ready. What is he, 17?
remember Jaime at 17? - Better than you.
some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't.
his place is not on the battlefield.
it's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.
