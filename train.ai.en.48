Yeah, well, if my mom got the call, dad will show up there too,
Yeah, well, if only you two could trade places.

Yeah, well, if they did, they'd be here by now.
Yeah, well, if they followed him back to the airport,
Yeah, well, if they're happy, I guess I'm happy.
Yeah, well, if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll turn up soon.
Yeah, well, if this doesn't work, you're screwed.

Yeah, well, if we hadn't left three hours late...
Yeah, well, if we hadn't left three hours late...

Yeah, well, if we're gonna be stuck
Yeah, well, if weird al touches my wall
Yeah, well, if you 're looking for an apology, it isn't gonna happen.
Yeah, well, if you Haven't noticed, I'm kind of having a bad week myself.

Yeah, well, if you want a troubling question,
Yeah, well, if you want a troubling question, I got one for you -

Yeah, well, if you want to reach the widest audience,
Yeah, well, if you were a 600 - year - old hag
Yeah, well, if you were a 600 - year - old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in,
Yeah, well, if you were me, then I'd be you!
Yeah, well, if you'll remember,

Yeah, well, if you're so concerned, why don't you stay in the car?
Yeah, well, if your subject can fight these guys off?
Yeah, well, imagine it with my sense of smell.
Yeah, well, in America, the boss is the guy who doesn't need a gun.
Yeah, well, in America, the boss is the guy who doesn't need a gun.

Yeah, well, in mine, it's pretty much national sport.
Yeah, well, in mine, it's pretty much national sport.
Yeah, well, in my experience,
Yeah, well, in my head they're real.
Yeah, well, in my lab, I decide what gets run and when.
Yeah, well, in order to get through that door
Yeah, well, in other late - breaking news,
Yeah, well, in that case,
Yeah, well, in that case, I sure hope they like white meat.
Yeah, well, in that case, I'm starting a new tradition.
Yeah, well, in that first year,
Yeah, well, in the FBI,
Yeah, well, in the end, it wasn't worth much, was it?
Yeah, well, in the meantime,
Yeah, well, in the state of California, it's 15 to 20 hard time.
Yeah, well, in the third world, they don't have juice boxes.
Yeah, well, in this case, we're talking about
Yeah, well, in this context
Yeah, well, in this context
Yeah, well, in your case, I can see that happening.
Yeah, well, in your experience, who do we look at for this?
Yeah, well, including honest to a fault.
Yeah, well, including honest to a fault.
Yeah, well, instead it killed four people.
Yeah, well, internal alarm clock.
Yeah, well, is he filled with soft cheese?
Yeah, well, is that a bad thing? He's a great wizard.
Yeah, well, is that so weird?
Yeah, well, is there a place you can go?
Yeah, well, is there any way that we could...
Yeah, well, is there any way that we could...
Yeah, well, is there anything else that I can do?
Yeah, well, isn't that the point of winning the lotto?
Yeah, well, isn't that the point?
Yeah, well, isn't that the pot calling the kettle black?
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse than some I been called.
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
Yeah, well, it appears that winter is upon us.
Yeah, well, it appears to have been named after an ancient general.
Yeah, well, it beats memorizing Shakespeare, doesn't it?
Yeah, well, it better be 'cause this is what we've been working for since we got here.
Yeah, well, it better be done right.
Yeah, well, it better be soon.
Yeah, well, it better because this is what we've been working for since we got here.
Yeah, well, it better because this is what we've been working for since we got here.
Yeah, well, it better not be.
Yeah, well, it better not.
Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too.
Yeah, well, it can't compare to having to sit next
Yeah, well, it certainly felt like you were, and not in a pleasant way!
Yeah, well, it comes down if little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.
Yeah, well, it comes with the job.
Yeah, well, it comes with the job.
Yeah, well, it cools me off, altar boy. Deal with it.
Yeah, well, it could be worse. You could be my CAG.
Yeah, well, it could use a coat of paint.
Yeah, well, it could've been a lot worse, huh?
Yeah, well, it could've been obscured
Yeah, well, it could.
Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt to ask for a slight delay.
Yeah, well, it did scare me - it did.
Yeah, well, it didn't bring anyone else much solace.
Yeah, well, it didn't fucking work.
Yeah, well, it didn't go over too well with your friend here.
Yeah, well, it didn't happen.
Yeah, well, it didn't look that way to me.
Yeah, well, it didn't seem like that.
Yeah, well, it didn't take too much fuckin 'persuasion.
Yeah, well, it does that. That's what I wanted to tell you.
Yeah, well, it doesn't appear so.
Yeah, well, it doesn't dazzle.
Yeah, well, it doesn't get us any closer to finding that little girl.
Yeah, well, it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now anyway, 'cause he's dead.
Yeah, well, it doesn't need to be, 'cause he's not my type. Oh, shut up. He'd be anybody's type.
Yeah, well, it doesn't really excuse what she's done.
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this through.
Yeah, well, it doesn't.
Yeah, well, it falls under my premium - services package,
Yeah, well, it feels different.
Yeah, well, it fits the profile.
Yeah, well, it gives me a chance to actually hit something.
Yeah, well, it got you and your partner's attention, didn't it?
Yeah, well, it happens.
Yeah, well, it has nothing to do with me, either. Not anymore.
Yeah, well, it has to work out for us sometimes, doesn't it?
Yeah, well, it hasn't been an easy day for anyone.
Yeah, well, it hasn't given my family much happiness.
Yeah, well, it hasn't worked so far.
Yeah, well, it helps me relax...
Yeah, well, it hurts.
Yeah, well, it is a contact sport, right?
Yeah, well, it is a hole in the wall...
Yeah, well, it is a hole in the wall...
Yeah, well, it is a long drive back.
Yeah, well, it is a tiny little slice,
Yeah, well, it is a tiny little slice,
Yeah, well, it is close to the border.
Yeah, well, it is the sophomore prom, so...
Yeah, well, it is unusual, but I wouldn't worry.
Yeah, well, it is when you haven't got to know anything about a person.
Yeah, well, it isn't big enough for me.
Yeah, well, it isn't going to work here.
Yeah, well, it isn't. You're doing everything you can. The rest, I'm afraid, is on them.
Yeah, well, it just got hot again.
Yeah, well, it keeps my parents off my back so
Yeah, well, it keeps spazzing out on me in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah, well, it kind of does.
Yeah, well, it kind of put me to sleep.
Yeah, well, it looks like I'm the poor boy here.
Yeah, well, it looks like a kill - and - dump to me.
Yeah, well, it made sense yesterday morning.
Yeah, well, it makes for a pretty good victim.
Yeah, well, it makes me feel shitty.
Yeah, well, it makes me sick no one stuck up for you.
Yeah, well, it makes sense to me.
Yeah, well, it makes sense.
Yeah, well, it makes you look like a punkass.
Yeah, well, it makes you stupid.
Yeah, well, it means more
Yeah, well, it means'the perfect Union of opposites.
Yeah, well, it might be all right for date night in the barrio,
Yeah, well, it might have gotten around.
Yeah, well, it might not matter anyway.
Yeah, well, it might take me longer than some, but I, uh...
Yeah, well, it must be your great grammatical influence over me.
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.
Yeah, well, it needs a lot of work.
Yeah, well, it never is.
Yeah, well, it only takes one whack job
Yeah, well, it ran two monster races. Yeah.
Yeah, well, it seemed different at the time. Which is why I quit.
Yeah, well, it seems a C. E. O.'s work is never done.
Yeah, well, it seems like the feeling's mutual.
Yeah, well, it seems like the right thing to do.
Yeah, well, it should. It's a good principle.
Yeah, well, it sounds a bad case of gas.
Yeah, well, it sounds like the plan got messed up
Yeah, well, it sounds like you need a plan, buddy.
Yeah, well, it sounds like you need to lighten up.
Yeah, well, it sounds nice. But I can't go anywhere.
Yeah, well, it still beats going to the mall.
Yeah, well, it still doesn't explain
Yeah, well, it sucks just as bad being the girlfriend who doesn't know enough.
Yeah, well, it sure ain't goose chasing after some chick who, for all we know,
Yeah, well, it takes a hell of a lot of courage
Yeah, well, it takes a lot of work, Mr. Johnson.
Yeah, well, it took some work, but it's finally coming together.
Yeah, well, it turns out I may
Yeah, well, it turns out my dream was all for nothing.
Yeah, well, it used to be.
Yeah, well, it used to be.
Yeah, well, it was Easter.
Yeah, well, it was Len's idea.
Yeah, well, it was Queens, new York, for Europe in the middle ages.
Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.
Yeah, well, it was a lot closer than I would like to admit.
Yeah, well, it was a lot closer than I would like to admit.
Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it.
Yeah, well, it was extremely good of you to do that.
Yeah, well, it was just all kind of disorienting.
Yeah, well, it was just all kind of disorienting.
Yeah, well, it was kind of a him - and - me thing, you know?
Yeah, well, it was kind of a him - and - me thing, you know?
Yeah, well, it was like I just woke up one morning,
Yeah, well, it was my idea.
Yeah, well, it was nothing.
Yeah, well, it was only a couple of hours for us, so...
Yeah, well, it was really amazing for us.
Yeah, well, it was supposed to be,
Yeah, well, it was supposed to come off.
Yeah, well, it was the best I could do.
Yeah, well, it was your idea to come here, not mine.
Yeah, well, it was, until I stopped signing on and got this job.
Yeah, well, it was... The show sucked and everybody hated it. I'm sorry
Yeah, well, it wasn't an execution - type slaying.
Yeah, well, it wasn't easy.
Yeah, well, it wasn't for free, was it
Yeah, well, it wasn't for free, was it? I pulled you out of the gutter.
Yeah, well, it wasn't me.
Yeah, well, it wasn't my best, but you're coming to the one next week, right?
Yeah, well, it wasn't really hard.
Yeah, well, it wasn't really hard. You're not exactly the smartest kid in class, George.
Yeah, well, it wasn't your time.
Yeah, well, it wasn't yours to spend.
Yeah, well, it wasn't. It was a handout.
Yeah, well, it went viral, hence my urgency.
Yeah, well, it weren't gonna be Regan, was it?
Yeah, well, it won't be so romantic
Yeah, well, it won't itch much longer.
Yeah, well, it won't matter in the long run.
Yeah, well, it won't play that way on the morning news.
Yeah, well, it won't work with the others.
Yeah, well, it worked for me. I'm scared.
Yeah, well, it worked for me.
Yeah, well, it worked. I'm not going back with them.
Yeah, well, it worked.
Yeah, well, it works both ways. They do the same to their own.
Yeah, well, it would be helpful to know
Yeah, well, it would be if we were legally married.
Yeah, well, it would have been better about two hours ago.
Yeah, well, it would have to be,
Yeah, well, it would mean a lot.
Yeah, well, it would seem our captors would beg to differ.
Yeah, well, it would've been better if they'd done a few things differently.
Yeah, well, it would've been nice of him to at least offer a little help.
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be so bad
Yeah, well, it wouldn't hurt to look into it.
Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.
Yeah, well, it'll just take a minute.
Yeah, well, it'll keep you quiet for a moment
Yeah, well, it'll look pretty bad
Yeah, well, it'll look pretty bad if the I. A. Officer investigating you

Yeah, well, it's 9:06.
Yeah, well, it's February
Yeah, well, it's German sizes. They must run a little small, I guess.
Yeah, well, it's Snoopy and Woodstock.
Yeah, well, it's a curse.
Yeah, well, it's a curse. I spend half my life waiting for people.
Yeah, well, it's a different world now.
Yeah, well, it's a free country.
Yeah, well, it's a game I fear I underestimated.
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're in charge, huh?
Yeah, well, it's a little different for you.
Yeah, well, it's a little different for you.
Yeah, well, it's a little late for that.
Yeah, well, it's a living. I'm a tax attorney.
Yeah, well, it's a living. I'm a tax attorney.
Yeah, well, it's a long story.
Yeah, well, it's a lot of cash you're asking for.
Yeah, well, it's a miniseries about a 70 - something revolutionary war hero
Yeah, well, it's a miniseries about a 70 - something revolutionary war
Yeah, well, it's a porno. It's not proper filmmaking.
Yeah, well, it's a rookie mistake.
Yeah, well, it's a skill. Here.
Yeah, well, it's a skill.
Yeah, well, it's a solid two hours
Yeah, well, it's a terrible thing to feel about your partner.
Yeah, well, it's a theory.
Yeah, well, it's a tradition of mine. Gives me that extra edge.
Yeah, well, it's a vending machine.
Yeah, well, it's a vending machine.
Yeah, well, it's about to look a lot worse.
Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat.
Yeah, well, it's actually about my dad.
Yeah, well, it's all Greek to me. Can you help me out?
Yeah, well, it's all I need to keep you here for 24 hours.
Yeah, well, it's all greek to me. Can you help me out?
Yeah, well, it's all the same. I'm gonna need to see your badge.
Yeah, well, it's all througha different lens now, you know?
Yeah, well, it's almost summer.
Yeah, well, it's always been easy with us.
Yeah, well, it's amazing
Yeah, well, it's amazing what you can see when you really look, huh?
Yeah, well, it's an acquired taste.
Yeah, well, it's because it's really good. I liked it a lot.
Yeah, well, it's been 24 hours, so that's pretty much it.
Yeah, well, it's been a nice trip.
Yeah, well, it's been a while, almost as long as since we woke up in the same apartment together.
Yeah, well, it's been a while.
Yeah, well, it's been fun.
Yeah, well, it's been fun.
Yeah, well, it's been no pic - a - NIC at my place, either.
Yeah, well, it's been over a week.
Yeah, well, it's been sold,
Yeah, well, it's best for now.
Yeah, well, it's beyond me, too, man.
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here because there's no stargate on this planet
Yeah, well, it's complicated, James.
Yeah, well, it's complicated.
Yeah, well, it's dead. The oceans, the soiI, neither will sustain life.
Yeah, well, it's definitely something
Yeah, well, it's definitely something I've been thinking about lately, you know, starting a family.
Yeah, well, it's definitely something I've been thinking about lately,
Yeah, well, it's different with her.
Yeah, well, it's different.

Yeah, well, sometimes God gives you lemons,
Yeah, well, sometimes I feel bad about the way we used to treat him.
Yeah, well, sometimes I feel bad about the way we used to treat him.
Yeah, well, sometimes I just have to be right, so I'll say whatever Ihave to
Yeah, well, sometimes I overdo it.
Yeah, well, sometimes a mistake
Yeah, well, sometimes it takes a while
Yeah, well, sometimes it's easier that way.
Yeah, well, sometimes it's the people we think we know best
Yeah, well, sometimes it's the people we think we know best that we don't really know at all.
Yeah, well, sometimes life just isn't fair.
Yeah, well, sometimes luck is all you need.

Yeah, well, spring break is over for everyone,
Yeah, well, spring break is over for everyone, including myself.
Yeah, well, spur of the moment.
Yeah, well, staring at that map's not gonna help.
Yeah, well, stick around.
Yeah, well, still a long road ahead.
Yeah, well, still gonna make them.
Yeah, well, still plenty of time for it to blow up in your face.
Yeah, well, still waters.

Yeah, well, take a pause for the cause.
Yeah, well, take an aspirin and start.
Yeah, well, take the bus next time.
Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges.
Yeah, well, talk to me when it's in your neighborhood, Mr. Love - in.
Yeah, well, talking's a bit overrated.
Yeah, well, technically he hit me, so...
Yeah, well, technically it's my house.
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.
Yeah, well, technically, he was fired.
Yeah, well, technically, you did try to... That's not the point.
Yeah, well, technology's come a long way since I looked.
Yeah, well, tell him to call me.
Yeah, well, tell me something I don't know.
Yeah, well, tell that to baby.
Yeah, well, tell that to immigration.

Yeah, well, tell that to the press.
Yeah, well, tell that to the scent of shawarma
Yeah, well, tell that to whoever put me in this body.
Yeah, well, tell your client
Yeah, well, th's my Christmas gift to myself.
Yeah, well, thank you, anyway.
Yeah, well, thank you, my merchant prince.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Yeah, well, thankfully the way they behave over there has nothing to do with us.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot!
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave. We'll grab a beer sometime?
Yeah, well, thanks again for coming over.
Yeah, well, thanks again for coming over.
Yeah, well, thanks for buying all this stuff for me
Yeah, well, thanks for clearing that up for me.
Yeah, well, thanks for letting my family know.
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing. What a fi - douche.
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.
Yeah, well, thanks for setting me up
Yeah, well, thanks for setting me up
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Yeah, well, thanks to you, now she has no job and no income.
Yeah, well, thanks, but that's not the only reasonwhy I'm here.
Yeah, well, thanks, but the judge just shut me down.
Yeah, well, thanks, but the judge just shut me down.
Yeah, well, thanks, but yeah, you probably feel a little ambushed.
Yeah, well, thanks.
Yeah, well, thanks. Hold on.
Yeah, well, thanks.
Yeah, well, thanksfor the pep talk, lump - unh - unh, dude.
Yeah, well, that "team" is a gang of terrorists
Yeah, well, that actually is not gonna work, 'cause we're opening it in the city.
Yeah, well, that ain't a war.
Yeah, well, that ain't a war. Comparing doesn't mean it's the same thing.
Yeah, well, that ain't all I got to say to you, sugar.
Yeah, well, that ain't for you to say anymore, Jake.
Yeah, well, that all changed when we got rich.
Yeah, well, that all changed when we got rich.
Yeah, well, that all sounds Iike page 26.
Yeah, well, that all sounds like page 26.
Yeah, well, that all sounds like page 26.
Yeah, well, that all sounds pretty vague.
Yeah, well, that aren't all I got to say to you, sugar.
Yeah, well, that boring and nerdy guy has feelings, okay?
Yeah, well, that checks out,
Yeah, well, that couldn't have been easy.
Yeah, well, that depends on your point of view.
Yeah, well, that didn't count.
Yeah, well, that didn't go so well.
Yeah, well, that didn't stop you from going off
Yeah, well, that didn't work out.
Yeah, well, that does not always sway
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean that we have to go back there.
Yeah, well, that doesn't prove anything.
Yeah, well, that doesn't prove anything.
Yeah, well, that don't mean anything.
Yeah, well, that explains pretty boy's silk knuckles.
Yeah, well, that explains you.
Yeah, well, that fail smell isn't me,
Yeah, well, that fight you had at the bar didn't help anything.
Yeah, well, that figures.
Yeah, well, that figures.
Yeah, well, that goes without saying.
Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much.
Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much.
Yeah, well, that guy said we were fucked either way.
Yeah, well, that hat is in the lab right now.
Yeah, well, that is a little deceptive.
Yeah, well, that is a problem, but I did what I had to do and I will live with the consequences.
Yeah, well, that is a problem, but I did what I had to do and I will live with the consequences.
Yeah, well, that is crazy. Bye.
Yeah, well, that is not gonna happen. I hope you're right.
Yeah, well, that is the job, so get used to it.
Yeah, well, that kind of got cut short when I told him that I like somebody else.
Yeah, well, that leaves you $10 million light.
Yeah, well, that makes sense, but we can't go after it.
Yeah, well, that makes sense.
Yeah, well, that makes sense. That's where I lost her.
Yeah, well, that makes sense. That's where I lost her.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us, then.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
Yeah, well, that may be, but...
Yeah, well, that means he offed himself
Yeah, well, that means nothing when you're tantric.
Yeah, well, that might be a headline back where you come from,
Yeah, well, that might be true,
Yeah, well, that might explain why he didn't have the money for the condo
Yeah, well, that might no longer be an option.
Yeah, well, that must explain why I'm such a big supporter of yours.
Yeah, well, that never would've worked with a guy like this.
Yeah, well, that nice guy left you a half a buck tip.
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy for a genuine son of a bitch.
Yeah, well, that part's true, but how'd you even know we were here?
Yeah, well, that person, um, is asking for a lot.
Yeah, well, that pool's turned into a sweet aboveground frog habitat.
Yeah, well, that protects against searching and seizing,
Yeah, well, that right - wing nut job
Yeah, well, that seems like something you should've told us the last time
Yeah, well, that seems like something you should've told us the last time
Yeah, well, that should do it.
Yeah, well, that situation was different.
Yeah, well, that sounds like the jerks they are.
Yeah, well, that sounds like the jerks they are.
Yeah, well, that sounds nice,
Yeah, well, that sounds nice, but I can't go anywhere.
Yeah, well, that station house was shut down a few years back.
Yeah, well, that sucks.
Yeah, well, that sucks. Still, your focus has got to be right here.
Yeah, well, that tends to be our policy with pedophiles.
Yeah, well, that tends to be our policy with pedophiles.
Yeah, well, that thing that was unresolved got resolved.
Yeah, well, that vampire was there for her when you weren't.
Yeah, well, that was a different time.
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, well, that was a while ago. A lot's happened since then.
Yeah, well, that was all him.
Yeah, well, that was all off the clock.
Yeah, well, that was before I knew there was another girl missing.
Yeah, well, that was before I knew what we were up against.
Yeah, well, that was before I remembered what really happened.
Yeah, well, that was different.
Yeah, well, that was his advice.
Yeah, well, that was just exist now.
Yeah, well, that was just phase one of my new 18 - phase master plan.
Yeah, well, that was last week and, uh -
Yeah, well, that was my last chance for that stupid test.
Yeah, well, that was on purpose.
Yeah, well, that was probably her biggest mistake.
Yeah, well, that was something. Here.
Yeah, well, that was temporary.
Yeah, well, that was the easy one.
Yeah, well, that was the one thing hanging me up.
Yeah, well, that was the past. You were his future.
Yeah, well, that was the plan,
Yeah, well, that was the plan, but my guilt was getting to me.
Yeah, well, that was the point...
Yeah, well, that was the problem, wasn't it? He was never around
Yeah, well, that was unfortunate, 'cause now his lawyers want to classify this as suicide.
Yeah, well, that was unfortunate,
Yeah, well, that was yesterday. Today I've got money riding on it.
Yeah, well, that was your choice, wasn't it?
Yeah, well, that was, like, a total setup.
Yeah, well, that was, you know, her call. Not mine.
Yeah, well, that water's just goanna keep seeping,
Yeah, well, that works.
Yeah, well, that works.
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.
Yeah, well, that would be clutter, though, wouldn't it?
Yeah, well, that would be kind of tough.
Yeah, well, that would be kind of tough.
Yeah, well, that would be right.
Yeah, well, that would be right.
Yeah, well, that would fit our gang - initiation theory.
Yeah, well, that would make sense
Yeah, well, that wouldn't make my boyfriend really happy.
Yeah, well, that's OK.
Yeah, well, that's a good sign.
Yeah, well, that's a good thing,
Yeah, well, that's a lie.
Yeah, well, that's a reprimand.
Yeah, well, that's a story I'll go along with.
Yeah, well, that's a very, very good job for you to have.
Yeah, well, that's a...
Yeah, well, that's about as smart
Yeah, well, that's all I've ever wanted, was to be with you.
Yeah, well, that's all changing.
Yeah, well, that's all great stuff for the program,
Yeah, well, that's all great stuff for the program, but I'm worried about you right now.
Yeah, well, that's all pretty good, but I'm not sure that's everything.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good, but you're fired.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good, mate, but this isn't a living room.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good
Yeah, well, that's because "pregnancy" is one of the scariest words in the English language...
Yeah, well, that's because I almost caught him.
Yeah, well, that's because I stopped pouting.
Yeah, well, that's because Marcus is trying to buy my club.
Yeah, well, that's because, uh...
Yeah, well, that's blog's supposed to do.
Yeah, well, that's cops for you.
Yeah, well, that's debatable.
Yeah, well, that's different. I mean, that was like...
Yeah, well, that's disappointing.
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say,
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say, but if Lucifer burns this mother down
Yeah, well, that's fine, but anyone else?
Yeah, well, that's fine.
Yeah, well, that's from my paper.
Yeah, well, that's going around.
Yeah, well, that's going to have to wait. You're coming with us
Yeah, well, that's gonna stop.
Yeah, well, that's good to know.
Yeah, well, that's good to know.
Yeah, well, that's good.
Yeah, well, that's good. I thought it looked really exciting, too.
Yeah, well, that's great, but because they defy the odds,
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.
Yeah, well, that's her story.
Yeah, well, that's hospital time.
Yeah, well, that's how I make my living.
Yeah, well, that's how dads are. It'll get better as you get older.
Yeah, well, that's how dads are. it'll get better as you get older.
Yeah, well, that's how it turned out, didn't it?
Yeah, well, that's how that, uh, crazy director in l. A.
Yeah, well, that's how the story goes, right?
Yeah, well, that's how they look at the world.
Yeah, well, that's important, too.
Yeah, well, that's in the DNA.
Yeah, well, that's intriguing.
Yeah, well, that's just a pick up scene.
Yeah, well, that's just it, isn't it? That's just it.
Yeah, well, that's just it, you know.
Yeah, well, that's just not going to work now, is it?
Yeah, well, that's just the difference between me and you, Raymond.
Yeah, well, that's just what I do.
Yeah, well, that's just your opinion, buddy.
Yeah, well, that's kind of the point. Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's life.
Yeah, well, that's more than he gave those two women.
Yeah, well, that's my Christmas gift to myself.
Yeah, well, that's my Christmas gift to myself.
Yeah, well, that's my business. No, it's not.
Yeah, well, that's my least favorite part.
Yeah, well, that's never stopped us from going anywhere we needed to go before.
Yeah, well, that's next
Yeah, well, that's nice to hear, but it's a little too late.
Yeah, well, that's not a daddy you want giving you a spanking.
Yeah, well, that's not an incentive.
Yeah, well, that's not exactly
Yeah, well, that's not exactly how it happened,
Yeah, well, that's not going to happen.
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, okay?
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen.
Yeah, well, that's not gonna matter,
Yeah, well, that's not gonna matter, because you're gonna have to make your case without me.
Yeah, well, that's not gonna matter, because you're gonna have to make your case without me.
Yeah, well, that's not how it turned out.
Yeah, well, that's not how she sounded when I talked to her.
Yeah, well, that's not my problem nor is it my fault.
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.
Yeah, well, that's not really in my jurisdiction.
Yeah, well, that's not surprising.
Yeah, well, that's not the plan.
Yeah, well, that's not the rules. Okay?
Yeah, well, that's not the way a relationship is supposed to be.
Yeah, well, that's not up to me to decide.
Yeah, well, that's not what I meant.
Yeah, well, that's not what she did.
Yeah, well, that's not why I came.
Yeah, well, that's not why I came.
Yeah, well, that's not why I got the...
Yeah, well, that's not your fault.
Yeah, well, that's okay. Just bring your cell phone.
Yeah, well, that's one thing that I'll never know.
Yeah, well, that's one way of looking at it.
Yeah, well, that's only half true.
Yeah, well, that's our jacks!
Yeah, well, that's out. I was supposed to meet her two hours ago.
Yeah, well, that's perfectly normal.
Yeah, well, that's plenty enough for me.
Yeah, well, that's pretty, but, uh, you know,
Yeah, well, that's rough.
Yeah, well, that's rubbish. But nice try.
Yeah, well, that's sexual jealousy
Yeah, well, that's something I never got about you.
Yeah, well, that's something I never got about you.
Yeah, well, that's sort of the point.
Yeah, well, that's the beauty of being a free man.
Yeah, well, that's the chef's special.
Yeah, well, that's the exact same attitude
Yeah, well, that's the fucking goddamn game we're in, kid.
Yeah, well, that's the great thing about looking.
Yeah, well, that's the model.
Yeah, well, that's the problem.
Yeah, well, that's the problem. You're not just smelling it.
Yeah, well, that's the protocol, right, when things go tango uniform?
Yeah, well, that's the question - when's it come back?
Yeah, well, that's the right kind of thinking, 'cause it does affect the,
Yeah, well, that's the right kind of thinking,
Yeah, well, that's the short version.
Yeah, well, that's the trouble. I'm tired of meeting boys.
Yeah, well, that's the understatement of the year.
Yeah, well, that's the way it goes.
Yeah, well, that's the way it used to be before...
Yeah, well, that's the way it works. First we find out what it is, then we get you better.
Yeah, well, that's the world we live in now, isn't it?
Yeah, well, that's their mistake.
Yeah, well, that's tro problem.
Yeah, well, that's true.
Yeah, well, that's true.
Yeah, well, that's understandable. Considering the circumstances.
Yeah, well, that's very gallant of you, but you can stop bracing.
Yeah, well, that's very gallant of you,
Yeah, well, that's weird that she would bring something up
Yeah, well, that's what I came by to discuss.
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.
Yeah, well, that's what I thought, but look.
Yeah, well, that's what I wanted you to think.
Yeah, well, that's what I was anticipating but not what I discovered.
Yeah, well, that's what I'm afraid of.
Yeah, well, that's what I'm hearing.
Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.
Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying. We've been friends for a long time.
Yeah, well, that's what all my friends say. Heh.
Yeah, well, that's what cops do.
Yeah, well, that's what happens when you feed 'em.
Yeah, well, that's what happens when you regularly turn your brain to water.
Yeah, well, that's what happens...
Yeah, well, that's what he says,
Yeah, well, that's what it looks like to me,
Yeah, well, that's what it looks like.
Yeah, well, that's what made the video great.
Yeah, well, that's what sells.
Yeah, well, that's what some people want, you know?
Yeah, well, that's what they're gonna do now.
Yeah, well, that's what this is about, isn't it? Life.
Yeah, well, that's what we might do,
Yeah, well, that's what we're here to determine.
Yeah, well, that's what worries me.
Yeah, well, that's what you're choosing to believe.
Yeah, well, that's when he showed up.
Yeah, well, that's when he's not, leaving girls for dead in a deli.
Yeah, well, that's when he's not, you know,
Yeah, well, that's who I was.
Yeah, well, that's who I was.
Yeah, well, that's why God invented doorbells.
Yeah, well, that's why I - I brought you this book.
Yeah, well, that's why I didn't say it.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm asking you, lieutenant.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm doing a structural analysis of the plans.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm flipping through these books of the dead.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm proud to be an American.
Yeah, well, that's why I'm still a virgin.
Yeah, well, that's why it's good I have a season pass.
Yeah, well, that's why we're taking all these precautions.
Yeah, well, that's why you're here.
Yeah, well, that's why you're on wallet detail.
Yeah, well, that's your job, but...
Yeah, well, that's your job, not ours.
Yeah, well, that's' cause you're stilla romantic.
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's a relief -
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's a relief...
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's a relief...
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's probably a good idea.
Yeah, well, that's, uh, that's the old me.
Yeah, well, that's... Perfectly dreadful.
Yeah, well, that'team" is
Yeah, well, that, too. Okay, just so long as you...
Yeah, well, that, uh, Camembert cris isn't going to resolve itself,
Yeah, well, that... And the marijuana they found in the car.
Yeah, well, that... And the marijuana they found in the car.
Yeah, well, that... That can be tough to get.
Yeah, well, that... That can be tough to get.
Yeah, well, the 911 caller is an old lady from that building.
Yeah, well, the Colonel's right about that.
Yeah, well, the French bitch cured me of that pretty quickly.
Yeah, well, the Internet also says that we never landed on the moon.
Yeah, well, the Internet also says that we never landed on the moon.
