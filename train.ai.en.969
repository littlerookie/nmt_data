I think we're lucky there were no casualties.
go on.
well, in my opinion...
off the record, I think things could have been handled a little differently.
in what way?
rather than rushing him and confronting him, i would have let him go and tried to find a position where i could lay in wait for him.
didn't lieutenant Rose order the team to back up?
Yes, but not until after jin-lee sprayed the area with a full magazine of gunfire.
the chase should have never happened...
in my opinion.
thank you.
Valenza: Park hit Serano...
head of the k-town warriors' biggest competition.
he cut him in half, and it wasn't post-mortem.
DRAKE: Serano? Isn't he a major weapons dealer?
Valenza: Yep. Shot a couple of guys and emptied his warehouse.
Conrad: So now jin-lee is fully armed and financed.
Valenza: So what are you going to do?
you have to die now.
look, can I talk to him?
you were supposed to do that last night.
I said I'd get there when I could, Lucinda.
just put him on.
no, this not something you can just phone in, connie.
Lucinda, l...
please tell me you didn't kill him under questioning.
last time a guy died in custody under questionable circumstances, they awarded him 4. 5 million.
I wouldn't worry about it.
you need a body for a wrongful death suit.
What'd they just pack in the meat wagon?
our recycling, some newspapers.
what is going on here?
Mr. Park has just consented to a staged death and funeral in the hopes of apprehending his son without further incident.
Gronbeck leaked a "death in police custody" story to radio seoul.
he put an obituary in the Korean Times.
a funeral means real mourners.
any one of those warriors sees a cop...
we'll see them long before they spot us.
it's high-risk.
you give me a prettier dress, I'll wear it.
Conrad: All right, listen up.
merced is at the front door doing a meet and greet with the mourners.
check out faces, listen to conversations.
Rodriguez, you set up on the street by the truck.
Rodney, you're here monitoring the chapel's surveillance camera and any cell phone activity in the area.
Eddie, from your vantage point, you got 360-degree coverage.
anything happens, you call it.
Jimmy and I got the back exit.
everybody good?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
OK. Let's move.
Hey, what's going on with that dog, man?
you got that under control?
shut that thing up.
shut the hell up!
ma'am, put the dog inside.
he don't come inside.
I'm ATF...
he don't come inside!
your call. Your call.
come on, boy. Come on.
come on, come on, come on.
thank you for your cooperation.
Rodney: Flower van coming around the corner.
two guys in front.
the guy holding the flowers is jin-lee.
Merced. They're coming in.
guys.
on my signal.
put smoke bombs in the van what for my signal and light em' up.
go, go!
back door.
going to 3 side.
blow it.
get down on the ground! Get down on the ground!
I got him.
lieutenant, I got him! I got him.
lieutenant, I got him!
I got witnesses.
shut up.
someone wants to say good-bye.
dad?
they told me you were dead.
that they killed you.
what's going on?
what are you doing to me?
you can't do this to me!
you can't do this!
I'm sorry about dinner last night.
Aw, save it.
one night a month and you can't make it.
I couldn't be there.
I have a job, not like you.
Oh, what do you mean?
ownin' a restaurant ain't a job?
it's just a place you come to drink.
Hey, you remember who you're talkin' to.
dinners were very important to your mother.
so was not getting her face smashed in every time you got your load on.
what did you say?
you know something, pop?
you're lucky I let you sleep at night.
what does that mean?
what does it mean?!
that's what it means!
God.
I need to talk to you about the incident in the alley.
belichek said you were disappointed in my command?
lieutenant, l...
there were things that were handled well and things that went bad.
on the day you need to follow orders without question.
I did.
but after, in retrospect, you got a problem, different theory, come to me. I'll hear you out.
you're naval intelligence.
you got insights i don't have.
I respect that.
thank you, sir.
the only way i can trust you is if I know that you can tell me the truth.
sir.
anything you want to tell me about Jin-Lee's apprehension today?
no, sir.
it's all good.
DRAKE: What the hell are you talkin' about?
you disobeyed my orders in a standoff.
I shouldn't even be giving you a warning.
I know we got a lot of history, not all of it good, but that means shit when we're on the job.
sir, I know a little bit about dragging people into cop shops because of the color of their skin.
Hey, you remember who you're talkin' to.
Mcgloin: You're lucky i let you sleep at night.
what does that mean?
what does it mean?!
Mcgloin: That's what it means!
pop, you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
um, can you come outside for a second?
I need to talk to you.
you can come in. Clara's baby-sitting.
your mom's not here?
no. She's on a date.
Oh?
uh, listen, kiddo.
about me and your mom and what happened the other night, l...
it's ok, pop.
I know you're not coming back.
even though mom wishes you would.
did she tell you that?
Nah. I just know.
how?
well, you're the only one that can make her laugh.
Aah!
no, man, no.
whatever you want.
you tell edwards good-bye for me.
what do you do with this?
what do you mean, sir?
every morning, new crime scene, new pool of blood, new reason to shoot to kill.
life just doesn't mean what it should.
life is precious.
no, it isn't.
it's cheaper than spit and day-old bread.
world's got different priorities.
we got caught in the middle.
and I can prove it.
anybody see anything?
come on. Simple question.
no? Nothing?
how 'bout this guy? Anybody see this guy?
no? Huh. Nothing.
double homicide. Broad daylight.
nothing, huh?
rubio: Hey!
can I talk to you for a minute?
who the hell are you?
take it easy. I'm max rubio, l. a.p. d. Gang unit.
who are you guys?
Conrad rose, l. a. Fugitive squad.
I've heard of you.
I'm touched.
guy's number 95 on my list.
my team's been on the street for 3 days.
turning over stones and rolling up on bodies.
you know it's him for sure?
no, i'm standing here for the view.
Yeah, i know it's him.
the dead gangster was supposed to be helping us.
well, these people, you can't talk to them like that.
you should know better.
keep preaching, and we've got a problem.
these people aren't stupid.
and karsh is leaving a blood trail.
they're letting him piss all over their world.
they're just protecting what little they've got left.
don't give me the "silence in the ghetto means survival" sermon, ok?
somebody's got to cooperate.
look, man.
I've been working the gang unit since jordan played for the bulls.
I know how the people in this neighborhood think, and i know what most of them want.
if they wanna eat dinner in the dark every night so the drive-bys don't mark 'em, then they're sure ringing the bell.
they want to be left alone.
just like you and me.
what?
nothing.
well, it's just like you said.
we've been bird-dogging cars for 3 days now, and, uh...
this guy maybe...
who knows?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
where are bert and ernie?
DRAKE: Coming, dear.
Conrad: Three days, two more bodies.
cop was responding to the shooting when he happened on karsh in what appears to be a territorial dispute.
we ended up with a positive i. d. Of karsh by the dead gangster's mother.
when did that come in?
sergeant rubio from l. a.p. d. Gang unit e-mailed it to me about an hour ago.
karsh made the list for the usual sins.
murder, drug dealing, and more murders.
the folks in the hollister projects are too afraid to talk.
l. a.p. d. Operated a sweep after the shootings to try and flush him out into the open, but they didn't find him.
not to dump on anybody's cake here, but the community leaders claim that black-on-black crimes don't have the same priority as crimes against white west-siders.
a car-jacking in brentwood gets a faster response than a drive-by in south l. a.
it isn't racial. It's pragmatic.
how's that, sir?
it isn't black-on-white that gets the freshness date, it's animal-on-animal.
black, white, brown... choose a color.
time, resources, and money.
well, it's funny that time, resources, and money always seem to end up in brentwood.
write your congressman.
why don't the local residents just keep it simple and give him up?
because after we go home, they have to deal with the consequences of helping us.
we're left pounding sand.
Yeah, if you gotta pound something.
Rodney, punch in tight on him.
let him in!
Hey. Sorry i'm late.
this place is hard to find.
that's the way we like it.
guys, this is sergeant max rubio, l. a.p. d.
you know jimmy. Rodney gronbeck.
rubio is from the l. a.p. d. Gang unit.
didn't know we wear hiring.
we're swimming upstream, tommy.
I thought we could use some help.
great, that's just what we need around here is another pair of testicles.
where you guys at on karsh?
dry... from behind.
nice.
my unit's been tracking this guy for 3 years.
coincidence we overlapped.
Yeah, maybe.
the rival gang member he killed was more than just about turf.
what else is new?
that killing today was a dog pissing on a fence.
karsh is looking to search and destroy his way into control over all south central gangs, and if he pulls it off, he's going to have all drug traffic in between downtown and the south bay.
that would require hardware.
exactly.
this rolls back the odometer.
simply chasing karsh is a waste of time.
gang bangers respect strength and blood.
as long as karsh keeps ducking us, he earns more credibility on the street.
more acolytes fall into line, we get outnumbered, write 'em off as an acceptable loss.
that's the recipe.
my suggestion is we canvass all weapon and drug sales.
not the penny ante stuff, the big seizures.
you got any guys in gangster college willing to roll over on karsh?
in prison.
Simmi edwards. He was the leader of the gang karsh hit yesterday.
I put him in lancaster penitentiary.
you mind taking rodriguez along with you while you interview?
not at all.
Eddie, time to go back and see karsh's loving sister cassandra.
she's a witch.
Mcgloin: Hey, ike.
Ike: Hey.
this is carla merced, naval intelligence.
good to meet you. Come on.
how's that fugitive squad you're working?
you know, knocking 'em dead, one asshole at a time.
I'm a little jealous.
how's that?
no bureaucracy, no politics, you don't have to play bitch to due process - we warrant every search and arrest.
Yeah, right. Don't tell me you never ignore legal procedure to make an arrest.
sometimes, we all do. - That's all i'm saying.
being right doesn't justify breaking the law.
in today's world, it does.
Ah, fascist with a badge. That's hot.
all major weapons investigations we got going on at the current time.
nationwide?
it's just l. a. County.
we may need to interrupt a seizure to set up a buy.
whatever you need, jimmy, and forget about the politics.
we both want the same thing, right?
I hate shitty cops more than bad guys.
Yep.
I have a clear shot at his back.
take it.
Simmi, man.
karsh smoked one of your homies yesterday.
six pack was a fool.
six pack was covering your ass till your release.
shit will work itself out.
Yeah, can you tell us how?
what sorority are you with, greaseball?
can't you tell?
well, you look clean.
you look like you're locked up.
come on, man.
you and me go way back down in hollister.
I know how plugged-in you are.
Yeah, I guess.
so? Karsh is gonna take what you got.
everything you worked hard to get.
dell karsh ain't worth a pull.
look, you can stand there being a smart ass, giving crap to me and an f. b.i. Agent, acting all stainless, but you know as well as i do that the gangs on the street protect the gangsters inside.
and if you let your set go, karsh is going to have somebody in here backdoor you till you bleed.
you can't threaten me like this.
Yeah, I can. I do it all the time.
try remy. - Remy?
doesn't he owe you?
he's all up on crack.
for a handful of rock, he'd dance with the devil.
and that's the problem, ain't it?
what?
the devil's a better dancer than y'all.
huh. Ah.
all right.
Yeah.
I need to talk to you.
what? Again?
Yes. I'm in trouble.
I took care of your speeding tickets already, so don't worry.
Connie, i can't do this alone.
Lucinda, i'm up to my ass at the moment. I've got no time.
you're the only one i can tell this to.
tell what to?
just, could you, please?
you gotta give me the day. I'll do my best.
OK, just let me know, ok?
fine.
Yep. Absolutely.
Cassandra, do you remember me?
Eddie drake. Questioned you a couple days ago about your brother dell.
demon.
we don't need to go there.
fornicator.
guilty.
may i come in?
dell killed two people, including a cop.
you can stand there rocking back and forth all day like you've been struck by lightning, but if you don't help me find him, you are going to jail.
you're not leaving here alive.
I think i am.
dell is a god.
dell's a piece of shit, and he's going to die in violence if you don't help me catch him first.
write this down.
how do you spell that?
don't kill my brother.
or what?
or this.
or you'll blow me?
don't kill my brother.
you will find him very soon.
there will be blood. You'll get the chance, but don't kill my brother.
where is he?
behind you.
ha ha ha!
Ah, ha ha ha!
man: Yo.
look at me.
hope the others get the message to back off.
you should close your eyes.
Tommy, you don't have to watch over me.
I know.
I'm fine.
I know.
then what?
we're family. What am i supposed to do?
I'm family? - Yeah, we all are.
before this hallmark moment, you were treating me like a venereal wart.
one beating and i'm family?
all right, i'm sorry. Forget it.
Hey.
Thanks.
no problem.
Conrad: Nothing.
did he go in my apartment?
no, I swept it.
you Ok?
a little bruised.
Carla. Are you ok?
not yet.
guy came out of nowhere?
Yeah.
and didn't rob you?
no.
or try to sexually assault you?
no.
did you see his face?
Yeah.
but it's gone.
nothing.
he said that he hopes the others back off, and he told me to close my eyes.
what's this?
he spit on me before he ran.
I thought maybe we could put it through the database, see if we get lucky with a dna match.
anybody got a ziploc?
you smoke?
I own a bar.
Tommy, run this tonight.
Yes, sir.
we're in early tomorrow.
Hey.
I'm not sleeping here tonight.
jeez, jimmy, was there a sport you didn't play?
my mom thought it was important to keep me outta the house, so she signed me up for every sport of every season.
where is she?
that's her.
weird.
what's weird about my mom?
no, it's just weird to see the other side of someone you've been elbow-to-elbow with and...
really know nothing about.
we're not supposed to know anything about each other by design.
what's that, the lieutenant's sun tzu managerial paranoia?
you got that t-shirt?
you know, it's just that, when you know too much about somebody, it...
can be distracting.
you start to think about them in terms of their weaknesses, their... vices.
and then, uh, you rely on them less when it comes to back-up.
back-up on the job?
back-up anywhere.
gets muddy.
you're not planning on a wife and kids, then, are you?
I sure am.
well, that's a pretty goddamn cynical point of view of human interaction.
no, it isn't. - Yes, it is.
I mean, if eva braun were still kicking it, you'd be in there.
bed's made.
a good day at the office is not going to keep you warm at night, jimmy.
I know that.
made you an ice pack.
it's like flowers, but different.
good night.
we're not gonna make out?
shut up.
Jimmy. - Yeah?
thank you.
go to sleep.
sleep well?
like a baby. I woke up crying every 20 minutes.
Heh. - How's merced?
she's beat up. Getting checked out to make sure nothing's broken.
Jimmy, no one outside the top command in this city knows about this team.
Yeah. Plus a handful of city coppers, a few feds.
agreed. But nobody outside this building has access to our files, the list, our tactics, or our home addresses.
so how'd this guy get to merced?
Yeah. Can you get 50 or 60 automatics out of a. t.f. Evidence?
tsk. I can get a thousand.
Thousand's too many. He'd smell a trap.
don't worry, rodney. I only hit 3 keys and i left your files alone.
I didn't say anything, sir.
you gonna bait karsh with the guns?
gonna need to do this fast. How soon can you get the hardware?
this afternoon.
Rodney? - Yes, sir?
how do you tell the difference between a legitimate leak of information and a manufactured one?
syntax, detail, timing, and source.
if the language is too direct or vague, no good.
too much detail, not real.
released too close to the target operation's liftoff, hot steaming scheemo. And the source cannot be exotic.
what are you bird-dogging?
merced was stalked, beaten, and warned off this caper.
the guy had her address. He knew her parking space.
how's karsh getting it?
how do we know the attack is related to karsh?
pissed off a hell of a lot of citizens during this ride.
go get the package. Rodney?
Yes, sir? - Compose an interoffice l. a.p. d. Memo about another agency using el michoacano taco stand as a meet on a weapons sting.
you got it.
Lucinda, i'm sorry. This is the quickest as i could get here.
Hey, what's wrong? What's going on?
uh, nothing. I mean i'm sorry i called you.
I know you're busy, but...
I just couldn't think of anyone but you.
I didn't want anyone but you to come to me.
well, what happened, kid? You and brad doing ok?
no. I don't know.
OK, Ok. It's all right. I'm here. What?
I'm pregnant.
so this is a good thing, right?
you and brad are gonna your own baby.
Yeah, it would be...
if brad was the father.
it's yours, connie.
it's yours.
[Exhales] well. How do you know?
don't you and brad... - he's sterile.
and the only other man i've been with is you.
and you told him that?
Yeah.
you know, honesty isn't always the best policy.
it took us 3 years before we had tony, 2 with millie.
I know, I know.
are you telling me i hit a dinger on the first pitch?
Yes. Yeah.
Brad... won't marry me if i have this baby.
what? An abortion cleans his slate?
he's angry. He gets to be.
he's a nine ball.
at least, you know, we're still talking though, so...
my opinion matter?
please don't tell millie and tony about this until i can figure things out, ok?
that's a big no.
it's raining hammers right now, connie.
I can't deal with anyone else's feelings but my own.
why'd you call?
because you're the safest place i know.
how far along?
5 weeks.
you sick? - Oh, yeah.
remember to hold your hair back when you puke.
OK.
you banging anybody i should know about?
what? - Answer me.
what the hell's the matter with you?
one of my people got attacked last night.
the assailant knew who she was, where she lived, and what to say, and the only new bitch on my dance card is you.
Hey! I didn't say anything to anybody about your team.
that's now what i'm accusing you of.
lieutenant, i did not give you up.
how do i know that? - Heh!
I haven't trusted a gang officer since rampart.
I don't blame you.
it was merced? - Right.
she ok?
Yeah.
well, look, I got an address for a lionel remy.
that's the guy i got on my visit to lancaster with rodriguez.
I saw we coordinate a pimp slap visit.
that's gotta wait. - Why?
log on to n. i.n.
Why?
indulge me, max, will you?
what am I checking?
Rodney posted a sting in association with karsh to sell some guns.
there. There it is. Let's go.
where?
to see who shows up to buy the guns.
what do you need me there for?
Oh, because if i'm with you from now on and you don't see me making any calls, you know i'm clean.
I already lost one guy in this unit.
I'm not ready for another folded flag on my conscience.
all right.
whoever looks up that case will be in the log.
we'll have our leak, and i'll buy you a steak.
Mastro's.
whatever you like.
Conrad, on wire: How we doing?
the guns are in the trunk of my car.
any diners looking you up and down?
only some creepy ex-prostitute.
is anyone really ever an ex-prostitute?
just your mother.
Wow. Is she still calling?
Heh heh!
you guys sure got some nice toys.
hasn't replaced a warning shot.
Heh heh! You know what the l. a.p. d. Warning shot is?
boom! Stop or i'll shoot.
ha ha ha!
you guys took a lot of heat for accurate warning shots the last couple years.
there's no such thing as a warning shot.
Amen. Full spread down a dark alley, some asshole shooting at you, suspect driving right for you.
they ain't warning you.
that's what internal affairs doesn't understand.
I like this guy.
get a room.
Mcgloin: Girls.
let me see your hands! Show me your hands!
get on the ground! On the ground now! On the ground!
Unh!
you recognize 'em?
no.
Yeah, rodney. - I got 2 hits on my warrant notice.
one came from rubio this afternoon.
Yeah, well, i was in his office. Yeah, the other?
the other came from an l. a.p. d. Terminal as well.
we got a mouth-breather in l. a.p. d.
Hey. Hey, what's up?
what's going on?
what's going on, man?
that's him.
what's going on?
who are you guys?
I haven't done jack, and i haven't been charged, so this is illegal.
now you get these off of me!
Oh, you feel pretty tough while i have these on, don't you?
you want to be uncuffed, asshole?
you want a fair fight?
fine. Hey, merced?
she gets the first punch.
that's what I thought. Sit down.
Valenza: You're under arrest for assault and the intent to do great bodily harm, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting a felon.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Hey, shit-for-brains, you beat an undercover agent, you leak classified information to a gangster.
you work for dell karsh, and you're going to jail.
prison. - What he said.
I didn't do anything.
you logged onto the n. i.n. And gave that information to the guys we busted at the diner last night.
and you assaulted one of my officers.
no, I didn't. - You spit in her ear, stupid.
you remember that dna sample you gave to the department when they hired you?
it came back a match.
I sent it in this morning. We're not getting the answers for a week. What's he doing?
what i'd do.
I need a lawyer.
heh! You need way more than a lawyer, my friend.
man, you need god. - A couple angels.
and a good word from the devil.
all right. I want to make a deal.
a deal? Hey, here's a deal.
you don't cooperate, you'll be tried, convicted, and sent to general population, where i promise you you'll be killed.
now you play nice... and you live...
in solitary.
come on, officer. Find your balls.
come on.
I told karsh's guys about the guns last night.
good boy. - When'd you start working for him?
look it up, fool. I grew up with him.
he was the one who had the idea about me going to the academy.
that way he always knew when police were coming.
I shadowed any investigations or undercover operations that were getting close to him and gave him the heads up so he could move the other way.
where is he? - I don't know.
how did you contact him?
how do you contact him? - All right!
look, my mother still lives on 77th and granger.
for a guy on the naughty list, you're asking for a lot of presents.
come on, man! You keep her safe...
and I will give you karsh.
Jimmy, eddie, go.
I owed you that.
Hey, connie, you think we are too late?
we're always playing catch up.
what i mean is leaks spread.
if karsh finds out his man has been arrested, we might lose him.
we need to find our other informant.
Remy? - Yeah. Captain's right.
karsh might already know about bullock.
he's certainly gonna know when his mother goes in to protective custody.
Yeah, but what karsh has been counting on is a heads up.
he's flying on instruments now.
Connie, you've got a phone call.
hello.
Hey, it's me. Um, I need you to pick up the kids.
Lucinda, I can't.
Connie, i just got home from the hospital.
you ok?
no.
sure. Whatever you need.
ms. Bullock.
Oh! Dell. How you doing, darling?
I'm doing good, ma'am. Running around here and there, this and that.
Rick's not home. - Oh, i know that.
what's that for, dell? You know i hate guns.
Hey, hey.
Oh.
mom, are you ok? - Yeah, you ok, mom?
I'm fine, sweethearts.
how'd your hurt yourself. - I took a fall.
the doctor said I'll be just fine.
you get a cast or something?
no, just some stitches.
can i see 'em?
not right now.
we're gonna get all your stuff from the bedroom and bring it out here, ok, mom?
Yeah, that way you don't have to move around a lot.
you can have your magazines and stuff.
Yeah, and be by the tv and near the kitchen if you get hungry.
Oh, come here, you. Thanks, sweets.
I'm sorry you got hurt, mom - come on, let's go get her stuff.
Yeah.
what happened?
I slipped in the bathroom.
hit the floor like a bag of rocks...
and started bleeding.
by the time i got to the e. r. the baby was gone.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
wasn't the right time, babe.
I know, I know.
just felt nice, the thought of being a mom again.
you are a mom every day.
you tell brad yet?
no.
go. Go.
no, i've got time for you.
no, they said i would need like a week in bed so i'm just gonna need your help with, um, driving to... to practices and camps.
OK.
thank you. - You're welcome.
it's a shame we couldn't have been this nice to each other when we were married, huh?
heh!
we weren't meant to be, uh... any more than this.
Yeah. This is pretty nice though, huh?
Yeah.
listen, um...
if you want to try again in a couple of months...
heh! - You know.
get out of here, you sharpshooter. Get!
see ya.
see ya.
Gronbeck: When drake and mcgloin got to the house, the lady had been shot and stuffed under a car.
lovely. Where's bullock?
sequestered in central jail.
we can't let him know what happened to his mother.
Lionel remy? It's l. a. Metro. I want to talk to you.
I'm having sex in here, man. What do you want from me?
heh!
Oh, rubio, man!
you don't bring nothing but bad news.
hold on, sweetie, just hold on.
Hey, you're naked, brother.
you jealous? Ha ha ha!
heh!
Heh. Not even a little bit.
I figure i stay naked, this won't take as long.
am I wright or am i right? Ha ha ha!
we need karsh, and i mean right now.
man, I ain't digging my own hole just because you can't find him.
Remy, your choices are you ride with us to central jail, or you get to go back inside and finish riding your date.
karsh is spooky, man, and his sister's a witch.
she'd be seeing shit in the dark for him, man.
Remy, we busted bullock.
call me impressed. Ha ha ha!
Hey, you all swallow? Ha ha ha!
Remy, focus.
he's a surfer, man, and he hangs out in venice and he likes to...
we've had 2 dozen arrests in the last half hour and no sign of karsh, and what with the suicide of our last best witness, we have few options and almost no time before karsh has south central explode into open street war.
can jimmy and i have an hour to ourselves real quick?
sure. - We need a warrant, too.
what for?
for the damage.
what are we looking for?
I'll know when i see it.
Aah!
huh.
witch, my ass.
Rodney, i'm calling from the sister's phone.
you got the number?
work your magic.
this could be it.
you hit the g-spot, boys.
we got the location of his drugs, guns, snitches, and whores.
how about where he's hiding?
Gronbeck: Wait a minute.
Yeah, this number keeps popping up.
what is it?
karsh, like all good fugitives, uses untraceable and disposable cell phones.
but those calls still need to be routed with fixed towers and lines.
she made a dozen calls a day to a number that was routed through the west l. a. Grid, specifically, the mar vista sub station, and those calls were returned through the same station originating from...
within a block or 2 of pacific and washington.
I'll bet you the wet spot he's still prowling around down there.
would you recognize that s. u.v.
that almost ran you down?
what do you think?
heading up wavecrest court with rubio.
car's parked in the alley behind the house.
Roger that, sir.
Connie, we're in position on the side.
make sure the corners are locked up.
shut up!
we're gonna close this thing down tonight.
we're gonna wipe up the rest and move in for good.
you call "hut," we're up inside him.
clear.
Conrad: Fire in the hole.
Jimmy, eddie, check the house!
come on out! Come on out with your hands up!
plain sight! One at a time!
come on out! Get down on the ground!
get down on the ground!
move!
move!
Conrad: Look out! Look out!
Karsh: Move! Out of the way!
get out of the way! Move!
Conrad: Look out! Look out!
move! Get off!
Conrad: Keep pressure on it, keep pressure on it.
gotta hang in, tommy.
let me go! Let me go!
let him go! - No!
I mean it, karsh! Right now!
No!
son of a bitch!
run out of here, kid! Now!
are you kidding me?
typical day at the office?
Yeah.
if you need me, i'm around, all right?
Max, days go sideways so fast around here.
you didn't hurt my feelings, connie. Forget it.
you do owe me a steak, though.
tomorrow night.
let's wait and see what your tomorrow night's like first.
right. See ya.
how you doing, tommy?
you ok?
you owe me.
owe you what?
some kind of explanation why my left hand may go numb.
cause you're a cop.
Yeah, well, I ain't going like joe vacco.
what do you need, a hug?
I'm sorry you got stabbed today, but you carry a badge, you sign up for that shit.
maybe it wouldn't bother me if i thought you were a little...
if you thought i what?
if i thought you were a little more squared away with tactics.
you're in shock right now.
this is the vicodin talking.
and that's what i'm telling myself so i don't shitcan you right here and now.
Yeah, you said it, i didn't.
be careful what you ask for, tommy, you may get it.
good night, kid.
good night, dad.
you doing all right?
do I have a choice?
still achy?
throbbing.
what, uh, what happened with brad?
Oh, he, um...
he said that he was sorry.
but that he was happy.
believe that?
he was happy.
what did you say?
Oh, I told him to find the nearest sharp object and shove it up his ass.
that's my girl.
good.
easy, easy. - Good girl.
easy. - Yeah.
good girl.
this is a stubborn one, huh?
there we go.
who's a clever girl?
come on, boy.
easy does it. Easy does it.
come on, steady does it.
morning, pop.
put your mark here.
good luck.
get the colt...
easy.
now that's a beauty. - Forget it, Ted.
he's half thoroughbred and not got a day's work in him.
now, there...
there's your ticket.
but look at him, Si. Look at that creature.
don't be daft. You need something solid to plow a field.
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.
alright gentlemen, settle down, settle down.
horses on my right, men with money in their pockets on my left.
it's the perfect combination. Is Fred Goddard here?
Yes! I's here. - Good, more money than sense.
Dave Hill? - I'm here. Yes!
bugger off, you tight bastard.
you've been coming here for 20 years, never bought so much as a pork scratching.
OK, first up today, a gorgeous young horse.
prettiest thing I've seen since my wife on our wedding day.
let's get going, shall we? Who wants this wonderful creature.
one guinea. - One guinea, one guinea...
I thonght you needed a plow horse, Mr. Narracott. - One guinea, one guinea...
any advance on one guinea? - Two guineas.
two guineas. - Three.
three guineas. - Ted Narracott, it's completely the wrong animal.
si Easton, I'm not gonna let that bastard see me off.
six! - Seven.
greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody.
eight! - Stop it, he's your landlord, you can't be picking fights with him.
ten guineas. - You haven't got the money.
let's go home, let's have a pint... - Eleven guineas, sir.
from as good a man as any in this town.
do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas?
that's top price for a working animal. Ted! Save it for the shire!
there are big days and there are small days. Which will it be?
do I hear any advance on eleven guineas? - Just let him go, dad, I don't care for him, he's too...jumpy.
shall we say, twenty five? - Twenty five guineas.
well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted.
you were great, Mr. N. Gave him a run for his money.
thirty. Thirty guineas!
thirty guineas.
going, going...
gone to Mr. Ted Narracott.
what have you done, Ted? What have you done?
quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do with him, on a working farm?
I hope you got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it when it comes due.
you're a food, Ted. And our Rosie'll never forgive you.
what have you done? - That's Mooney's colt!
you were supposed to buy a plow horse. - You bought him?
What'd you pay for him?
how much, Ted Narracott?
I won't tell you a lie, though I would love to.
thirty guineas. - Thirty guineas?
he's not worth ten! Are you out of your mind?
what about the rent? - He's a strong one, Rosie.
look at the way he holds his head! - How the hell are we gonna pull anything with that?
Ted, you have to take him back. You have to take him back right now.
no, no. - You have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back.
no, please don't take him back.
we can't take him back till he's broken in.
and how are you gonna train a horse with that leg?
I'll train him. - No, you stay out of this, Albie.
you don't know nothing about horses. - Please, Mum. Please let me. I can do it.
we have to keep him. No choice.
well, you've got one month to break him in or I'm taking him back myself.
how did you get to thirty? What other fool bid you up that high?
it was Lyons.
we're gonna lose everything.
after all we've been through, we're gonna lose it all.
don't worry, Mum, I'll raise him.
and I'll raise him good. - Well, you better.
go on, get started.
see if a child can undo what your fool of a father's done to this family of ours.
right, let's make a start then.
it's oats. Very tasty, that is.
it's beef and gravy to us!
I bet you're missing your mother.
look at you... first time without your mum.
first time away from home.
but you're not alone, are you?
in fact. Cos I'm here...
it's alright, it's alright.
I'm gonna call you Joey.
understand? Joey.
that's you.
and I'm Albert. It's alright.
you're mine now. You're mine.
good boy.
I want you to stay there, Joey.
stay.
good boy. That's it, you've got it.
Hey, look at him, Albie. He's playing "Grandma's Foodsteps."
right, come on Joey. Back you go. Come on.
you've gotta stay there, understand?
that's it.
you've got it. Good boy.
good boy. Good.
now call him. Whistle.
come now, Joey. Come on.
you can come now, Joey.
don't think he fancies your owls. - No, I read it in a story.
it's how the indians used to summon their horses.
now, Joey, when I whistle, you've gotta come,
understand?
my dad had a dog who stayed when you called him.
he used to run up behind you when you weren't looking, and...
he's not a dog.
he's just puzzling it through.
brilliant, look at you.
Albie!
there's only fifteen here.
the rest will come.
you know by rights I could take this farm back today, don't you?
and I'm a great believer in my rights. - It will come.
if you drank less beer, and bought fewer horses,
you might be able to look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.
I said I'll pay you.
we got to plant the bottom field. - Bottom field's rock hard.
only stones down there. - No, we're going to plow it.
just give me until the autumn. I'll pay every penny I owe you, with interest.
how you gonna plow it? Not with that fancy animal of yours?
he will do it.
you'll not get that one in a harness, let alone pulling a plow.
even drunk on a Tuesday night, you know that. And I can't wait for the money, there's a war coming.
I promise you, that field will be plowed.
we'll plant it with tuinips.
and the money will be yours when harvest comes.
please, sir. Please.
very well.
if that fancy plows that field I'll give you till October to set things straight.
what if he doesn't?
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.
and I'll take your father's farm and give it to working men
who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company.
no, please, sir, you can't do that.
now, now, now. What? Are you bladdered as well?
Ted Narracott, I got you down in my book.
you can't harness him. - He's got to be collared.
no, you can't. Look, you're scaring him.
you're scaring him, he can't take a plow!
he's got to plow! - He won't be able to do it.
he's too young, he's not even been backed yet...
it's alright, boy. It's alright.
I knew this would happen soon as I laid eyes on him...
no, Ted ...
Ted, no! - He's worth nothing to me!
it he won't take the collar, he's not worth a damn thing!
dad? - Move aside.
dad. Stop.
you shoot that horse we have nothing.
No!
you were right what you said, Dad. "He'll do it.
you told Lyons, "He'll plow that field." And he will!
you'll see. He'll show you.
we'll show you. We'll get it done.
let go. Let go.
go back to the house.
here, here. Some days are best forgotten.
today ain't one of them. Come on.
how are you today, Joey?
I don't know much about life, boy.
but I do know that there are big days and there are small days.
and most days are small days, and, well, they don't matter much to anyone.
but this ...
this is a big one. This is our big day.
it's cold out there, so I'm going to take this off.
well, if it's tough for you, it should be tough for me, too.
I'm gonna teach you how to plow, and you're gonna learn.
is that understood? And then we can be together.
which is how I believe things are meant to be.
steady, boy. Here we go.
easy, easy...
look at me Joey. See?
see?
you've just gotta put your nose through.
that's it.
see? You've got it.
you've got it.
too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots.
even a sturdy plow horse'd never manage it alone.
yet he will, I say.
you'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if Albert had told you so.
it's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. Even if he is a bit barmy.
a team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he? - 'Course he's watching.
well, you've raised him up a true Narracott, Ted.
picture of his father, he is:
not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness
that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.
wasn't a farmer in Devon didn't admire you, myself among them.
leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself...
...at this stoney patch of unpromising ground.
you've fettle enough for 20 men.
but with a gimpy leg and the drinking...
for the pain, isn't it, that you drink?
none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this.
makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place.
not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did.
and now your son's sinking into the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.
see Joey, I got the collar, too!
come on, boy. Walk on.
that's it.
walk on.
walk on, Joey.
you'd be better off starting at the top of the hill and going down!
gravity is the only friend you're gonna have today, young lad.
walk on, Joey! Walk on!
it'll take the whip to move him.
Barvo! You've reached the top of the hill! Off you go again, boy!
you'll make even better time going down!
Albie, we're all with you!
well done, keep going. Keep it straight.
the plow hasn't even cut yet!
do you know? I believe we can do it, Joey.
I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the best of us.
that's why he bought you. He knows you've all the courage he never had.
I knew when I first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us.
you've got no chance, lad. He'll not turn over half an acre. Give it up now.
you've done well. You've tried fard. You're more of a man than your father.
come on now, Mr. Lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it? - Well, he'll destroy that horse.
I'll be over Thursday.
give you a day to close it up.
your wool. I'm sorry, Rose.
now, boy! You've got ot do it, Joey!
you don't know, so I'm gonna have to do the knowing
for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! So get set to pull, and pull straight!
and pull hard!
now, boy! Go!
go around it!! - Whoa, Joey! Whoa, Joey!
Joey, stop! You'll break the blade!
will you look at you?
I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade. He could lose a foot!
you'll likelier lose an eye, Mr. Lyons.
if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son!
or my plow, of my horse, or my field, or my farm!
come on Albie! Push on through!
get it done, Albie! Get it done!
Albert, all right? Are you all right?
Oh my pair of fools. My mighty fools.
you're as battered and bloodied as he is.
and where's dad? - Still in the bottom field.
stumbling about, I suppose. - It's not the drink, Albert, that makes him stumble...
he drinks, mum. - Well, so might you if you'd been...
...where he's been, seen what he's seen!
well, he don't talk to me about it.
he don't talk about it beaouse he can't. There aren't words for some things.
come here.
the mice've been at it. Sit down.
here. It's his campaign pennant.
he was Sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry.
and that...
...is the Queen's South Africa Medal.
every man who fought in the Boer War got one of those.
but this ...
that's the Destinguished Conduct Medal.
not dad's? - Well it ain't mine, dear.
he got that after the fighting at Transvaal. After he'd been hurt...
and he'd saved some other lads, and well... I don't know what else, he won't tell me either.
but the first day he got home he just tossed them out.
first day he could walk, he threw them straight in the dustbin, and wouldn't hear a word I said not to.
see, what you done today, you and Joey, you're chuffed up now.
and so you should be, my splendid boy.
it's good to be proud when you done something good.
but what he done, in Africa, whatever it was,
he takes no pride in it.
hard as it surely was, and however much pain it's cost him,
he refuses to be proud of killing, I suppose.
I would be proud.
if I'd gone off to war. If I'd gone and saved my mates...
well, whether or not you think you'd do the same thing as him... Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.
Oh, your dad makes mistakes. And he drinks to forget the mistakes that he's made, but...
but he never gave up.
and he does that for us.
and today you showed the world, it's all been worth it.
you keep looking after Joey and he'll always be looking after you.
sergeant, Seventh Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry.
you see this Joey? It's been through an entire war.
I'm not stealing it. I'll give it back to him, someday.
I'm the only boy that drives in the village. No one else drives but me.
that's right, this is my dad's car.
you're lucky that you're in it. I'm not normally allowed to drive it...
is he a friend of yours?
come on, boy. Let's show her how to fly!
well... you're clearly not gonna be a jumper.
we can try planting something else.
or we could hire ourselves out to Uncle Bob.
how else we gonna pay Mr. Lyons' rent?
what we gonna do?
I used to believed that God ...
...gave each man his fair portion of bad luck.
I don't feel that any more. I've had more than my share.
you'll stop loving me, Rose. And I won't blame you when you do.
well, I might hate you more, but I'll never love you less.
it is war. We are at war with Germany.
england is at war with Germany.
they're going to ring the bells at six o'clock.
and then never ring them again until the war is over.
look smart, Joey lad, it's the Tavistock Fair!
what has he done with him?
last name first. First name, middle name, last.
take my work for it, finest horse in the parish.
goes like a racer, strong, decent, very fine.
no curbs, no splints, Good feet and teeth.
he's as sound as a bell, sir. - How much are you charging, sir?
for this strong, decent, and very fine animal.
40. - I give you 20, and not a penny more.
20 is no good to me, Captain. 35 and he's yours.
I don't even know how he rides. - Oh, he rides... Splendidly.
you'll be astonished. I promise you that. Finest horse in all of Devon.
finest horse I ever seen.
thank you.
you can't! You can't, he's mine!
I trained him. - Albert ...
you can't have him. He's my horse, sir. - I'm afraid it's too late, lad. I've just paid 30 guineas for him.
please, I'll get you money.
I'll get you money. I'll...I'll work for it.
I will work for it.
he won't obey anyone else. He won't be any good in the war, neither.
he shies at every sound! - I'm sorry.
well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too. I'm volunteering.
I see. What's your name, lad? - Albert, sir.
and how old are you? - 19 sir.
is that the truth? - No, sir, but ...
no sir. But, but I look 19 and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds, sir! And I'm strong, sir! And I...I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert, but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering.
and your father has done what he had to do, you know that.
30 guineas isn't nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your Joey,
I know that. But it's all I've got.
will you lease him to me, Albert, to be my own mount?
I promise you, man to man, that I'll look after him ...as closely as you've done.
I'll respect him and all the care that you've taken with him.
and if I can, I'll return him to your care.
now say goodbye.
it's all right, boy. - All right, turn it in, eh?
that's enough. He's a horse, not a dog.
now, on your way. Come on.
do you want to lose the farm? Rose?
it's the way you did it.
but we are at war.
aren't we just.
Joey... - I told you? Sling your hook!
let him be, Perkins.
this isn't the end. This isn't the end, my brother...
I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again.
wherever you are, I will find you.
and I will bring you home.
steady, steady.
walk on, walk on, come on.
to the stables. - Yes, sir.
easy, easy.
Joey! Stop mucking about, you hear?
you're in the army now, son. Good boy.
relax. Easy easy, back up.
Joey, meet Topthorn. Topthorn, this is Joey.
sort out who's in charge between the two of you, you hear?
if you want to fight, you get it over with.
because once we're over there, you're gonna need everything you've got for Fritz!
gently, Perkins. I don't want to sour him.
there'll be nothing gentle about the war sir. And ther'll be nothing gentle about this one either!
I understand that, Sergant, but I want him fit and shining.
he's my horse.
scares the living daylights out of me. - Who?
Perkins. I'm glad he is on our side.
not bad. Not bad at all.
still not a patch on my Topthorn.
I wouldn't be so sure. I think he's got potential.
he's certainly got the bit between his teeth.
I actually think my Blenheim is faster than the pair of them.
clear off!
all right, gentlemen, listen here.
everyone tells us the same story, from Waterloo to Omdurman...
...from Pickett's Charge to the Battle of Mars La Tours...
the first attack can and should be the decisive one.
Perkins? - Yes, sir.
no excuses, no mistakes. Every house groomed and fit for presentation.
I want a full practice charge tomorrow. - Yes, sir.
thought you two had bottled out. - As if.
all right, then, let's see what you two jokers are made of, shall we?
this is what quiet confidence looks like. - I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.
over to you, Captain Nicholls.
Draw...swords!
Give...point!
come on, Joey. I know you've got it. Come on, boy!
nice of you to turn up. - He's got speed...I'll give him that.
but has he got stamina? - He has everything.
what are you up to? - I'm writing a letter.
with a picture in it?
it's to the boy who owned Joey. I want to show him how wonderful he's looking.
before we take him away across the Channel to face a million Germans guns.
Yeah, before that.
4 a. m. start tomorrow, tarvelling with the Dragoon Guards and the Royals.
transport detachment, they'll need to be at the docks at 5 a. m.
check all kit. Battlee orders: no polishing,
buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons, let them all go dull.
I want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away.
of course.
what do you think of the new cap?
silk lining. I quite like it.
I'm not sure it's going to make a lot of difference to the Germans.
Oh I don't know about that. Think about it ...
you are a Boche, just working out which of two chaps to shoot,
and you thought, "Good Lord, one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap indeed!
you might shoot the other one instead.
or, alternatively, think, "I fancy that cap," and kill you first of all.
hadn't thought of that.
france 1914 QUIEVRECHAIN
that is our target, the German 11th Division,
at the moment bivouacked 3 miles to the east of the Menin Road.
we have been watching them and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires.
knock them out, and we could slide in behind the German lines...
and come at them from the South at Geluveld. - Excellent.
numbers? - About 600. Infantry.
twice our size... - In regiments of horse and men, the advantage is ours.
and we have surprise on our side. But the sonner we move, the better, we have no assurance they'll still be there tomorrow morning.
right, good. So, today it is.
Charlie, tell the men. - Salisbury formation?
Salisbury formation. We'll charge through them and secure the ground behind.
the grass to the left is taller than we are, it's perfect cover.
excellent work, Sergeant Major.
time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted. - Thank you, sir.
they have no idea we're coming. - Not having scruples, are you, Jim?
no, I understand the surprise is everything.
but if it must be done, let's do it quickly.
are you alright, Charlie?
never been better, literally.
never better.
prepare to mount!
Mount!
thank you, Stanley.
Hey, Joey. My bonny boy.
you're all right, aren't you, Joey?
gentlemen, it is an honor to ride beside you.
make the Kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us.
let every man make himself ...
his king, his country and his fallen comrades proud.
be brave. Fear God, honor the king.
fear God, honor the king.
draw swords!
good luck, my friends.
forward, to walk! March!
forward to canter!
Canter...march!
Kavallerie!
charge!
kill them all.
stop it. Go back.
what? Did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended?
look at yourself!
help anyway. Those horses dying.
come on, boy.
calmly.
come.
hold it.
what do we do with the horses? - If they're injured, shoot them.
and the others, sir? - The others you round up and taketo base camp, they will pull guns.
you'll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns.
then shoot them also. - Sir, perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances.
to get the injured men off the field.
will they take the harness? - I'd like to try, sir.
it won't work, they're cavalry. - Let's try.
you won't get the harness on. - Come on, Michael.
easy, easy, whoa, whoa...
easy, easy, easy...
Gunther! It's hopeless.
we can't help them.
well, well, look at you. Whoever taught you this has just saved your life.
hello the farm! - Hello, Si Easton!
I was at the post office and while I was there, Mrs. Allen said...
a parcel had come for Albert, from the...
from the, from over there, and I thought...
I could go up that way in the morning. And, here it is.
who'd be sending me a parcel over there?
well, open it and see.
it's a sketchbook.
that's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!
see that? That's a picture of Joey! - It's a picture of Joey.
well, I never! - And there is a letter.
well, go on then, go on.
dear Albert Narracott.
captain Nicholls, who died...
captain Nicholls, who died in action today left you this. Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins.
you weren't to know it was bad news. - He was riding Joey when he died.
you don't know that he was riding him... - "In action," it says.
gentlemen.
we move forward to the frontline tonight.
full marching orders.
hurry up. Schroeder! Schroeder!
not you, you. Come.
I'm keeping you here. You are the best with the horses
and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west.
they're pushing through? - I'm told.
we will move later when we find where the horses are needed most.
perhaps I can keep my brother here with me, he's also very good with horses.
Oh no no. Not necessary. Get moving. We leave tonight.
it's all right, Gunther.
you are not going. I'll tell them you are only 14.
that you are a boy. - Father signed me in.
he knew my age, and so do they.
mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt.
of course she did. I just wasn't listening.
but you need to listen now! I promised her, I made her a solemn promise.
that you would be safe with me. With me, Michael!
they'll never make a head count. There are too many of us. You can stay here.
silp underneath the bed, until they move out.
then what?
Gunther, it will be fine.
and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses.
I'll see you at the front. We'll be together again.
forward I said. - I'm giving this to you. For luck.
hurry up.
to keep you safe.
in runs. March. Left, two, three, four.
left, two, three, four.
forward. One, two.
marching I said.
one, two.
get back in line!
I'm hungry. Did you bring food?
I'm sorry.
will Father be ashamed? - He will pretend to be.
maybe at first he will be.
but in the end, he will be glad.
and us? What about us?
I was ready to go.
I was proud to go.
I wanted to go.
the food in Italy is good. - Yes.
what about the women?
not as good as the food. - Because ...
...they've eaten too much of the food?
you're too young for war, and you are too young for women.
I don't feel so young.
not anymore. - Go to sleep.
we have a big night of riding ahead.
good night, Michael.
night night, Gunther.
Schroeder. - Yes, sir.
a mistake?
a promise.
go ahead.
grandpa.
it's closer today.
the wind plays tricks with the noise, it's moving away from us.
I can hear it, Grandpa, and there is no wind.
you shouldn't lie to me. - Here. There is no wind here.
but over there, a wind of strong it will lift you off the ground.
you lie about everything.
you say you aren't worried but it's clear you are.
I know the war is approaching but you say, "Oh, it's just a trick of the wind."
did I say that?
you started lying when Mama and Papa went away.
they are dead.
but you won't say so.
do you think I'll die if you tell me the truth?
the truth is ...
you should speak to your elders with respect.
if you tell me the truth about the war,
I will tell you the truth about the big horses
I've been keeping in the windmill.
now, who is the one telling lies!
in the windmill? - Yes. They were standing in the windmill waiting for Don Quixote.
this is Francois and this is Claude .
I named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer.
they must belong to someone.
horses like this don't just appear from a fairy-tale.
Yes, I know, Grandpa. They are not unicorns.
so I'll be fair and wait, one day.
and if no one comes to get them by night-time, then they belong to me.
look at me, Emilie.
you can not ride.
mother used to tell me how my bones would give away with the slightest bump or fall.
that's right. So it is settled?
good girl.
it will only be settled when I decide which one to ride first.
over my dead body! - At least I won't have long to wait.
I was in love with a boy called Francois, who had your lovely eyes.
unfortunately he was in love with a girl called Marie, who had your teeth.
she fell for a boy called Claude,
who broke my heart. And who I intend to marry one day.
eyes on me.
no talking.
today we learn to jump.
did you know the French cleared 1. 85 m at the Paris Olympics to win the gold medal?
today we will beat that record.
this is your jump.
when I call you... Be very brave and leap over it.
leap over it! Watch me.
and now it's your ...
he doesn't think we can do it. But we will show him.
won't we?
no need to be afraid.
you are ...very tall.
you'll kill yourself.
only if you get in my way to make me fall.
Oh please, come off the ladder.
find somewhere to hide them.
and do it quickly!
get out.
my name Bonnart. This is my land. Why are you here?
food for the soldiers at the front.
everyone must give their share.
quickly. - Works.
hurry up. - Up here.
they are taking everything.
where are the horses? - What horses?
above.
what is it? - Leave it if you don't know what it's for.
a pot if a pot. We'll find some use for it.
sir, where's the livestock?
I make jam. We have no animals.
but ther's fresh hay in your barn. - We use it to replace the mattress stuffings.
her grandfather? - Yes.
where are her parents? - They are dead.
they died.
what is that? - The wind. It plays tricks in the attic.
there is no wind. - An old house creaks.
go, close the shutters.
take it with you.
she's sickly, no?
if you or any of your friends harm her...
as old as I am, I will kill you.
you know, I was going to give back your pot.
but now I'm going to keep it.
for soup.
we will be back in the new season.
tell me what happened to them.
to my mother and father.
you said you'd tell me how they died.
on my birthday. Tomorrow is my birthday.
they died fighting?
didn't they?
but when the soldiers come, you do nothing.
you are a coward, aren't you? - Yes. Yes.
it was your parents who were brave.
I make jams.
and you've never done a brave thing in your life?
maybe there are different ways to be brave.
did you know that the French have the best carrier pigeons?
and this could be the difference in the war...
our messages getting through.
I do not want to hear about the birds.
they were released at the front told to go home.
this is all I know.
but to get there, they must fly over a war.
can you imagine such a thing?
here you are flying over so much pain and terror...
and you know you can never look down.
you have to look ahead, or you'll never get home.
I ask you, what could be barver than that?
what is that? - A present.
I hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that I then have to wear like last year.
it was disgusting? - Yes.
I looked like an ugly nun.
give me your hand.
grandpa, we have no money.
when the war is over, then you can buy me jewels and carriages.
anything you say, my sweet one. Anything you say.
you're the boss of course.
it's just an old thing I found
do not worry yourself, Leave it, I'll put it back.
it was your mother's.
I hid it, so as not to encourage you.
Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly, very carefully.
and promise me you won't go far to the top of the hill and straight back again.
I promise. My hero.
slowly.
let go of me! - She is my granddaughter.
stop! Don't hurt her, please!
do not hurt her.
you do not need them. There are so many others.
please, take the bigger one and leave the smaller one.
you are breaking my granddaugher's heart.
the was has taken everything from everyone.
what will happen to them? - They will pull artillery until they die.
or until the war is over. - It will never be over!
you have your answer then.
Heiglemann, these are yours. They look strong.
should last a month or two.
you're beautiful.
it's a pity they found you.
such a pity...
pull together.
Halt!
stop.
Heiglemann, bring up another one! - Heiglemann, bring up another horse!
that one.
no, the big black one.
come on.
he's a good horse, sir. But if you move him up to the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.
prince is already losing condition. His leg, sir.
you have given them names? - Yes, sir.
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose.
his leg is not good enough, sir. - Private, you will do as you are told.
hook him up.
as you see, sir, this one is stronger.
hook him up.
come.
come now.

And...Fire!

if you live, you'll get them back. Good lads. Valuables in the bucket.
maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe it's a drill like last time.
a love letter?
that is my business.
I heard you and your mate were doing bird imitations again.

after you find your horse ...
I have lost my needle in a haystack and I could use some help.
anything valuable. Anyone who comes back gets to share it out.
stay here.
remember that day me and Joey raced you in your car?
I remember you somersaulting through the air.
who was that girl you were with? - There was a girl?
there was. Don't you remember?
it was just some girl, I suppose. I don't recall which one.
I do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch.
you see? Always entertaining, Narracott, I'll give you that.
you did that? You fell on your bum?
stay in position!
be brave.
hold your nerve, boys. Remember, it's not far to go.
run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open and God and the King will keep an eye on you.
company will fix bayonets! Fix bayonets!
you know what it reminds me of out there? That bloody impossible lower field the day me and Joey plowed it.
best day of my life that was and you were there.
and this here is the worst day of my life, about to begin.
and you're here cheering me on. Us two, always.
and him. - One you're in no man's land,
go to the flanks. Stay on the flanks. Come on, guys.
stick close to the gentry, that's our ticket, yeah?
we have the pluck but they have the luck.
keep going, guys.
you, too, Narracott. And you, too.
come on, on your ladders, boy. On your ladders. In you go, that's it.
listen to your sergeant.
if anybody turns back, if any one of our boys come running towards you, you take this rifle and you shoot them dead.
do you understand?
do you understand me? Do you understand what I'm telling you, son? You take this rifle, and shoot them dead. Understand?
up there, son. Up your ladder. Up your ladder to your work!

someone will come for you.
Albert. Albert, listen... - It's all right. It's all right.

no.
we made it. We made it.
come on. There.
Andrew, this way out.
gas! Gas! Gas!
Albie...
Hey, there's no stopping here. Keep them moving.
sir, there's something wrong. This one needs to rest.
there's no rest for them. Move them along. Move them along!
please, please, stay on your feet.
no.
please, stay on your feet.
come, please, go stand.
come on.
they're coming. Leave it, private!
go to hell.
run.
run.
stand to, stand to. There's something moving.
what the hell is it?
it looks like a cow.
what the hell would a cow be doing out there?
that definitely isn't a cow. - Well, what is it?
it can't be a horse. Nothing alive could be out there.
it isn't a horse. It isn't a horse.
Yes, it's a horse.
it's a horse. - Yes, it's a horse.
well, bugger me, it's a horse.
lads, we should call him.
how do you call a horse?
he's caught on the wire.
Oh sod it...
what do you think you're doing? Get back, do you hear me?
listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.
what's he doing? - It's a trap.
no, I don't think so. I think he's trying to help.
scare him back into his hole.
it's a white flag, ent it?
you see the white flag?
I'm just after tending to this here horse, is all!
get back, you stupid git!
the Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.
he leadeth me into green pastures,
he lays me down beside the still waters...
poor beastie.
poor babbie. It's alright. It's alright. Don't buck and wriggle so.
you're only shredding yourself.
you'll blind yourself.
bugger me worthless, I didn't...
...think to bring gloves or something to cut the...Ow!!
I thought perhaps you might need these. For the barbed wire.
Yeah, yeah I... um, thanks.
Cheers. Cheers. - Thanks.
that...that's a very long strand. When you cut it...
it's going to release ...
this, this and this.
and they'll coil back rather violently, which I'm afraid will only wound the poor fellow further.
you speak good English. - I speak English well.
may I?
what if we cut his head free first? So he won't try to stand up and blind himself.
and then... - Pity you didn't bring a second pair.
then I could but the wire here... - We need more wire cutters!
his blind spot. The cutters won't frighten him.
if you could cut here, holding this wire...
I could... - Say no more, I'm right behind you.
and you understand what's happening, do you not, O Best Beloved? That you must lay so very nice and still.
there's a lad, You're a remarkable horse,
helping us help you. There's a lad.
there's a remarkable lad.
so how's things in youder trench?
delightful. We read, we knit sweaters, and we train our rats to perform circus tricks.
well, if ever you need any more rats, we can always send ours over. 'Cause we've more than we need, strictly speaking.
besides, they scare off all the pretty girls. - Our girls aren't afraid of rats.
big strapping German girls, eh?
kind what gives robust massages?
every Thursday and they bring rum cake on your birthday.
look at that horse! Look at the muscles he's got.
them long legs. They're made for running, horses.
running away from danger.
running away is all they have. - Yet we taught them opposite.
running into the fray.
war horse. - Yeah.
war horse. And there he is.
what a strange beast you've become.
and now? - I take him back with me, yeah?
since I supplied the cutters, the horse is mine. This is fair, no?
in a pig's eye. He's English, plain to see. - Oh, you mean because he's so filthy?
because he's so smart, and you are none too clean yourself.
we could box. And the winner gets the horse.
no thanks, pet. Must be careful not to start a war.
do you have a coin of any sort?
coin toss? - Yeah.
all right, Fritz - you're on. - My name is not Fritz.
it is Peter. - Peter, I'm Colin.
you call it, Colin. - Heads.
that's the face of my Kaiser and he does not look pleased with me.
the horse is yours. - Gone quiet, hasn't it?
Yes. But wait half an hour and we'll be shooting again.
I'm a terrible shot, Pete, don't believe I'll ever hit the target.
Thanks.
cheerio, mate. You'll take good care of him, yes?
I will, our strange beast. - And you take care of your own strange self.
Colin, a pair of German cutters.
in memory of your handsome friend from Dusseldorf.
Thanks, I'll use him in the garden, in South Shields.
you keep your head down, now, Pete me lad!
remarkable! A remarkable horse!
we're full up. Move on.
the gas got him, we had to wait till morning.
this can't be all of us. - This is all.
all walking wounded, away to the dressing station!
away to the dressing station!
what's this doing here? - We need a vet, sir.
there are no vets. We've scarcely any horses left.
he's cut all over, but this leg here's got the worst of it.
it's probable tetanus. It's no good. - Please, sir.
I've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you?
please, Sir, this horse can pull through anything.
what is it? - It's a horse they found, wandering about in No Man's Land.
down you go. - What kind of a horse?
bloody miraculous kind of a horse, be my guess.
nothing makes it out of No Man's Land.
miraculous horse...
he's alive, y'see, sir, where nothing survives.
so to me and me mates, to the men, sir, he's, well, we have high hopes for him...
you should shoot him now. - Oh but I can't.
it'd be a mercy, lad, that leg's not going to mend.
sergeant, put him out of his misery.
ladies, if you please.
all right, back off, back off.
this way. He is here.
go on. Do it again.
Joey?
hello Joey. Where you been then, hey?
where in the world you been? - Do you know this man?
what is your name? - Narracott.
private Albert Narracott, sir. - This is a random horse, Narracott.
and too badly injured. Is this man in your care?
Yes, sir. - He's not random at all, sir!
he's my horse, I raised him, in Devon.
sir, look at his legs. He's got four white socks.
he is all brown all over, and he has a white mark here, like so...
take him back. - Come on, son.
wait, you can't see 'cause of the mud.
four white socks.
all right, break it up. Clear off, the lot of ya.
you see, sir? He is not random at all.
we will attend to your horse. Patch him up best we can.
treat him like the soldier he is.
thank you, sir.
gentlemen! Gentlemen!
it falls on me to give you some important news.
as of 11 o'clock today, in two minutes time, the War will come to an end.
the king and queen thank you for your service.
we have been victorious, even if at a higher price than many of us might have imagined.
when the bells ring out, and they will in a moment, for the first time for four years,
let our remember our brothers fallen in the field.
and thank God for the end of this stuggle
and victory.
I do not understand, sir. - Officers' horses only.
all other horses are to be auctioned immediately.
that is a complete and bloody outrage. It's the lad's horse, sir. From Devon.
he raised him up from a pup, he did.
trained him right up to the day when the army came to town. - Those are not my orders, Sergeant.
you'll have to take him to the market tomorrow. That's all.
we've all clubbed together. It's everything we have.
there's 29 pounds there. Buy him back.
does the Major know? - The Major put in 10.
mum's the word where the Major's concerned. Your friend on the crutches over there...
even asked the Major to say that Joey was his, an officer's horse,
so that he could go back with the others.
come on, Narracott! Get a move on. We don't want to miss the show.
seven pounds, seven pounds there.
eight pounds here.
any advance? Sold!
you're alright. Nobody's gonna bid more than 15 for a thoroughbred. They want work horses.
next one.
we start with four pounds? Four pounds?
five pounds. - Five pounds here.
further bids? - Seven pounds.
eight pounds. - Eight pounds.
nine. - Ten pounds.
ten pounds. - Eleven.
eleven. - This is the butcher of Cambrai.
he's been bidding for the best all morning.
let me handle this, private. Fifteen.
and let that be an end to it. - Fifteen pounds.
sixteen. - Sixteen pounds.
seventeen. - Twenty of your English pounds.
and let that be the end of it, my friend.
twenty pounds. - Twenty-five.
twenty-five pounds. - Twenty-six.
twenty-six pounds. - Twenty-seven.
twenty-eight. - Twenty-eight pounds.
twenty-nine. - And thirty.
any advance at thirty pounds? - One hundred pounds.
and sir, if you bid against me, I will sell the coat on my back,
and bid to 100. And if you bid against me again,
I will sell my farm and bid to 1000.
100 pounds.
going, going, gone.
sir, I'll give you all your money. Everything you paid...
when we get back to England. I'll give you twice...
you don't know anything about him. - Oh, but you're wrong, sir, I know everything.
Yes, you found him! I heard you found a horse...
in the wire between the armies. - No, I found him, he raised him.
when I heard about the miracle horse, I traveled three days ...
because I knew whose horse it was.
my granddaughter's. She saved his life ...
he was everything to her. - Where is your granddaughter?
the war has taken everything from everyone.
he is all that I have left of her.
don't be worried, boy, when I go.
I will not worry over you none.
Hey, I found you, didn't I? And you found me.
and we'll both...we'll both know that we made it through.
come, we are the lucky ones, Always have been.
lucky since the day I met you.
God be with you, sir.
do you know what this is?
it's my father's . it's his regimental pennant.
how did you come by this, sir?
you may have this.
thank you ever so much for this, sir...
and this.
no no, not necessary. He belongs to you.
that is, of course, what my little girl would have wanted. And she was the boss.
what was her name? - Emilie.
her name is Emilie.
no one would have believed in the early years of the 21 st century...
...that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own...
...that as men busied themselves about their various concerns...
...they observed and studied...
...the way a man with a microscope might scrutinise the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
with infinite complacency, men went to and fro about the globe...
...confident of our empire over this world.
yet across the gulf of space, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic...
...regarded our planet with envious eyes...
...and slowly and surely...
...drew their plans against us.

you want me to take that out? - Absolutely not.
come here. Let me see it. Let me see.
dad.
just look. Don't touch it. Dad. - Rach.
l can't. You're moving it around. - Okay, don't touch it. Just look at it.
lt's gonna get infected.
no, it won't. - Yes, it's gonna get infected.
no, it won't.
when it's ready, my body will just push it out.

you should get TiVo.
tim got it for my room. - TiVo?
lt's awesome.
l can watch all my shows after homework.
Yeah, l'll just put it on my platinum card.

Robbie.

kept one of their menus last time we were here.
you said order.
l meant order food.
where is Robbie?
he went out. - Out where?
l don't know. He just took your car and left.
who said that? Who's there?
lt's the clam burglar.
Steven, look at this.
what's up? - Check it out!
you ever see something like that?
springtime, maybe. Not this time of year.
come on, we can see better from the back yard.
you gotta come see this!
that is so weird. - What?
the wind is blowing toward the storm.
that is weird.
Hey, watch it!
Rachel, you wanna see something cool?
lt's okay.
l wanna go inside. - lt's okay.
l wanna go inside.
okay, you go ahead.
that's enough weather for me.
don't wanna go by myself.
lt's kind of fun, isn't it?
no. - Come on, like the Fourth of July.
no, it's not. - O, say can
lt's okay. You're fine.
lt hit right behind our house. - Yeah, well, it's
lt's not gonna hit there again, okay, because lightning doesn't strike twice in the same place. Oh, shit!
Where's Robbie?
l don't know.
ls Robbie okay?
are you okay?
Where's the thunder?
why won't it stop?
ls it over?
where are you going?
just-- l'm just checking things out. Just wait-- Wait there.
are we gonna be okay? - l don't know.
you don't know? - No, l meant, l just-- Just
Rachel, please.
just stop asking so many questions. Just wait here.
turn everything off.
everything is off.
l can't get one freaking thing to turn on.
you believe this, Ray? Every single car.
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
the car just stopped, and-- - You're okay?
are you okay? You all right? - The lightning started to hit.
and me and this other guy-- - Where the hell did you go?
over on Lincoln Avenue. - Lincoln Avenue?
by the church. - You saw the lightning?
Yeah, 26 times we counted, over and over again.
the lightning started to hit. lt opened up this hole or something
twenty-six times? - Yeah.
you're okay? - Yeah.
good. All right, well, your sister is in the house, and l want you to go in that house and l want you to stay with her, okay?
the next time you take my car with no driver's license and no permission, l call the cops.
you better be there when l get back.
Yeah. - Robbie.
Manny, Manny. Manny, what is it, dead?
all of them. Everything. Look at this.
the starter's fried. - Lightning hit it?
not even close. l thought if l changed it
any idea what's going on? - l'm on my way to find out.
try changing the solenoid. lt's probably fried.
right, that's what l said. l told you that. The solenoid.
Hey, they're saying all the lightning struck down by the church.
what the hell is going on around here?
let us through. - Hey.
let us through here. - Hey.
what up, Ray?
l should've known you two were behind this.
Hey, God's pissed off at the neighbourhood, Raymond.
l'll tell you that much. - You see it?
you got power where you are? - Nope. Nothing.
lt's the cars, though. That's the thing.
solar flare. That's what this guy told me he heard.
a solar flare? - The sun shoots off big blobs of plasma.
they turn into solar flares. lt's the only thing that can kill - all the electronic stuff. - Can l tell you something?
the sun does not cause lightning.
l'm telling you what that guy said. - l understand, but it just sounds dumb when you say
l never seen anything like this before.
that many strikes of lightning in one spot?
ls this the only place? - Come on, put that down.
you wanna step back, please? - Step back.
you're gonna fall in. - Get back.
back up, people. People, back up back there.
move back. Everybody back up.
move back.
move back.
ls it hot? - Back up.
no. - Back up.
lt's freezing. - What is that?
Oh, wait. Move. You feel that?
l feel that. - Hey, Bobby, come check this out.
you feel that? - Feel that?
Yeah, l feel that. - What is it, the subway?
there's no subway here. - F train, maybe?
that can't be the water main.
there's nothing else down there.
water main doesn't run through here. - Feel that?
there's something down there and it's moving.
everybody move back.
whoa. Back it up. Come on.
let's go.
come on, folks. Back up. Get back.
help me out here. Get back.
go! Move! - Everybody get out of the way!
everyone back up! Everyone clear the intersection!
get out of the way! Back up! Back up! Get out of the way!
forget it! Get back! - Get the hell out of the street!

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God.

dad, what's the matter?
what's all that stuff all over you?
ray. - What's all this stuff?
Hello?
ray?
we're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
what? Why? l have no idea what's going on.
all the food from the refrigerator and the cupboard, put it in here.
what's going on? Just tell me. - Just do it.
Rachel, sweetheart-- - Dad, you're really scaring me.
l need you to get your suitcase, - Dad.
the one that you brought, and bring it to me, okay?
can you just do that for me, darling? Okay?
l don't think it's a fire.

l can't tell you now. We've only got about another minute.
please.
please.
just keep it down. - Ray, l'm standing right beside you.
can you please answer me?

Hey, Ray? Ray.

get in the car. - lt's not my car. lt's not your car.
Manny, Manny, shut up. - Daddy's acting crazy.
you can't do this. Guy's gonna come back and
Manny, Manny, l don't have time to
you're busting my chops. l got a shop to run.
Manny, listen to me. - No, Ray.

l'm not gonna get in. l'm not getting in.
Manny, get in with us. - l'm not gonna get in trouble.
look, l'm not fooling around-- - Close the door, Robbie. Close it.

get down! Get down, get down! Get down!
ls it the terrorists?
just get down. Get down! Get down! - Holy shit!
where are we going? - We gotta go.

l'm not stopping until we're clear of it. - Clear of what?
we gotta go. - What's going on?
look, you saw, we're under attack! - By who?!
who is attacking us?!
Rachel? Rachel, you've gotta keep it down.
Rachel. Rachel. Shut up, Rachel.
you're freaking her out! - Look, l'm driving! Do something!
okay, put them up, Rach. Make the arms.
this space right here, this is yours. This belongs to you, right?
Yes. - You're safe in your space.
l'm safe. - You're safe in your space.
nothing can happen to you in your space.
okay. l'm gonna go to the front seat, l'm gonna talk to Dad.
no. - l'll be 2 feet away.
okay. - Will you hold my hand?
will you hold my hand? - Yes.
are you gonna be okay? - Yes.
l wanna know everything you know.
this
this machine, it crawled out of the ground, started torching everything. lt was killing everybody.
what is it? ls it terrorists?
no, this came from someplace else.
what do you mean, like, Europe? - No, Robbie, not like Europe!
that machine, it was already buried.
maybe it...
...it came down in the lightning storm.
they came down in a lightning storm. - What do you mean, came down?
you said it was buried. - No, the machine l'm talking about was buried, but what came down in the lightning storm, what operates it, that's the... You know.
the what? - That's
why aren't there any helicopters or airplanes?
lt's the what? - Hey, Rach. How you doing?
how is she doing? - How you doing?
fine. - She's good.
good. What was that thing you did? - Works sometimes.
she gets claustrophobic. - Yeah? Hey, Rachel?
l want Mom. - Yeah, l know. You feel better?
l want Mom. - Yeah? Tell me about it, you know?
take me to Mom's. - What l need is, l just need you to hold it together for me, okay?
l want Mom!
when you start screaming, l can't really drive
take me to Mom's! - l know that.
that's where we're going, Rachel. - Take me to Mom's!
l know!
hurry up, Dad. Come on.
Robbie, get the door.
mom!
mom! - Mom!
mom!
mom? Tim?
mom? Tim?
mom? - Mom?
Tim?! - Tim?
Tim?
mom?
they're gone.
ls she dead?
she's not dead. All right?
she's just not here, okay?
they were never here. - How do you know?
because they're on their way to Boston.
and so they just...
...kept on going up to Boston. Probably at your grandma's house.
l'm gonna call her.
how come the lights are on here and not at your place?
because...
...nothing bad happened here. Okay? So we're safe here. All right?
okay, Rachel? This is your area.
okay, you are safe-- - Dad, that's not how it goes.
okay. Well, are you hungry? l'll get you some food.
l'm gonna feed you. Get something to eat.
what do we have? - Busy signal.
ketchup? Mustard. - You think all the circuits are down?
Tabasco, barbecue sauce.
this is really good, Robbie. Vinaigrette. l said pack food.
what the hell is this? - That's all that was in your kitchen.
okay. No, it's all right.
all right. Okay.
food.
bread.
okay. We're gonna have...
let's get some sandwiches.
wanna see me deal?
wanna see me deal? Here we go.
there's two for you. There's two for Robbie.
there's two for me, one for the house.
okay.
maybe after we eat something, l'll go down and show you guys.
teach you how to play some poker? A little five-card stud?
maybe a little blackjack. - l'm allergic to peanut butter.
since when?
birth.
okay, well, here.
you can eat the bread. Okay?
l'm not hungry.
okay, well,
Robbie and l are gonna be eating peanut-butter sandwiches.
want jelly on this sandwich? - l'm not hungry either.
you're not hungry either?
okay.
okay, that's fine.
fine.
everybody just relax, okay?
because we're here now. We're safe, and we're gonna stay.
ln the morning, your mom and Tim are gonna be here.
and everything's gonna be fine.
okay?
okay.
lf everything's fine, why do we have to sleep in the basement?
we've got perfectly good beds. - Hey, it's like a slumber party.
what are you afraid is gonna happen?
nice basement.
l wanna sleep in my bed. Got back problems.
okay. Well...
you know on the Weather Channel when there's a tornado, they tell you to go to the basement for safety? lt's like that.
there's gonna be tornadoes? - Okay, Rachel?
Hey, no more talking, okay? - Could you be a little nicer to me?
God.
wanna stay here? - Yeah.
good. - Good night. Love you.
love you, Rach.
ls the lightning back?
no, this is something else.
what's that sound? - l've never heard that before!
ls it them? ls it them?
we gotta go.
where do we go?! Robbie, this is your house.
where do we go?!
no, no, no, wait!
are we still alive?
down here.
were you on this plane?
are you--? Are you a passenger?
how you doing? Wanna help me open this?
are you a passenger?
he's deaf.
the shell went off right beside him. Camera on his shoulder saved his life.
you hear that, Max?
your stupid camera saved your stupid life.
where were you?
out there in the Pine Barrens.
we were attached to a National Guard unit.
the 83rd Mechanized.
they moved on one of those things around midnight.
they got some kind of shield around them.
you can't see it, but everything we fire at them detonates too early, before we can get close enough to cause any damage.
when they flash that thing, everything lights up like Hiroshima.
there's more than one?
you gotta be kidding me, right?
we were feeding New York, but New York went dark.
so we patched over to D. C. they went down.
l. A. Chicago, uplinked to London.
even called the affiliates to try to get them to catch the feed, but nobody answers. lt's the same everywhere.
once the Tripods start to move, no more news comes out of that area.
my God.
you ain't seen nothing yet.
l saw that storm. l was right in the middle of one of those.
well, you didn't see it like this.
those machines come up from under the ground, right?
so that means they must've been buried here a long time ago.
so who's driving the goddamn things? Watch the lightning.
watch it.
watch the lightning.
keep watching the lightning.
what is that?
that is them. They come down in capsules, riding the lightning into the ground, into the machines, right?
you hear that?
we're getting the hell out of here.
get in, get in, get in, get in.
Hey, were you on that plane?
that's too bad. lt would've been a really great story.
look at me. Look at me.
you keep your eyes only on me, understand?
okay. - Don't look down. Don't look around.
l'm taking you to the car. You're gonna wanna look around.
but you're not going to.
are you? - No.
you're doing good. You're doing good. Keep your eyes on me.
l'm going right to Boston.
we're gonna see your mom. - l'm not gonna look, Dad.
that's a girl. That's my girl. Now listen.
l want you to close your eyes, okay? - Okay.
got them closed? There you go.
keep them closed for me. - Okay.
Robbie, get in.
Robbie, get in! - Why are you yelling?
lt's okay.
get in.
why aren't we on the turnpike? - l don't want everybody to see that we've got a working car. We'll stay along the Hudson till we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the Hudson.
we'll take the back roads across Connecticut, all the way to Boston.
where is everybody? - l don't know, running, hiding.
ln their basements. - lf we had balls, we'd go back - and find one of those things and kill it. - Right. Yeah, good.
why don't you just let me make the big decisions.
which would be when? Never, Ray?
Never's about your speed. - Stop it.
enough of the "Ray" shit. All right?
lt's "Dad," "sir," - Don't fight.
or if you want, "Mr. Ferrier."
that sounds a little weird to me, but you decide.
dad? - Yes, Rachel.
l've gotta go to the bathroom.
Really?
l gotta go. - Not so fast, not so fast, all right?
there's two things we gotta watch out for.
and the second is people who might want our car.
there's nobody around. - Yeah. l gotta go.
all right, Rachel?
Rachel, it's good right there.
l'm not going in front of you guys.
just go where l can see you. - Are you crazy?
don't look! - l'm not gonna look.
just stay in sight! - That's looking!
okay, well, listen, every time you guys don't listen to me, l'm telling your mother, okay? l'm making a list.
making a list.
l told you to stay where l could see you. - Sorry. l'm sorry.
stop! Stop!
wait! Stop! Let me on!
let me on! Give me a hand!
wait! Stop!
stop! Give me a hand! - Kid, you're gonna get run over!
give me a hand! You have room! - Robbie!
you wanna go in that direction? - Stop! Stop!
there's nothing living in that direction, Robbie.
what do you care? You never gave a shit before.
you never gave a shit! - Okay, hard-ass, what's your plan, huh? You're in charge now!
tell me what we're doing. - Catch up with these soldiers!
hook up with whoever else isn't dead, and we get back at them.
we get back at them. That's what we do.
let's try one that doesn't involve your 1 0-year-old sister joining the Army.
you have anything like that? - Just tell us the truth.
wanna try that? - You have no idea which way to go.
you wanna come off all wise and shit!
you only chose Boston because you hope Mom is there.
and if she's there, you can dump us on her.
you can dump us on her, then you'll only have to care about yourself, which is exactly the way you like it.
Robbie!
where are you trying to go?
what are you trying to do?
who's gonna take care of me if you go?
this is a test of the Emergency Alert System.
lf this had been an actual emergency, official messages from federal, state or local authorities would've followed the alert tone.
this concludes the test of the Emergency Alert
l'll close my eyes. Why don't you drive for a bit.
l don't have a license.
since when has that stopped you?
ray.
ray! Dad!
ray! Dad!
you think you could--?
you think you could--? Do you think you could--?
don't stop.
don't take your foot off. Okay?
l got it, but keep your foot on. Okay, l got it. l got it.
where is everybody going? - l don't know, Rach.
but we do, right?
Yeah, we do.
why did he do that?
why is he doing that? - He wants a ride, Rach.
everybody just wants a ride. - Can we give him one?
sit back and put on your seat belt. Robbie, put on your seat belt.
put on your seat belt, Rachel.
be careful. - How'd you fix this?
how'd you fix the car? - Please! Why won't you help us?
l'm sorry, l can't. l can't.
please, get away from the car.
Hey! Stop the car.
stop the car! - Get off the car!
you could carry 20 people in there!
stop the car! - Get off the car!
stop the car!
hold on.
look out!
watch out! Hold on!
are you okay?
no, wait! Wait!
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!
just stop! - Daddy!
Rachel!
get out of there!
Robbie!
Robbie!
ray! - Get in the car!
help! - Rachel! Get out of the car!
Rachel, get-- Get out of the car.
get out! - Daddy!
take it easy! - Get off the car!
get off!
get off the car! Move!
move!
Where's my son? - You don't need that, man.
Where's my son? Robbie! - Cool down, man.
put the gun down, man. - Robbie!
dad!
okay, now, listen.
put down the gun. l'm taking the car. - My daughter's in the car.
l'm taking the car, man. - Please. All l want
put down the goddamn gun! - All l want is my daughter.
l'm taking the car, man. - Please, l just want my daughter.
let me just take my daughter. Can l--?
secret Service. Find General Williams.
tell him Buck Mendell from Warehouse 13 is here.
I have full authority to shut down the Farnsworth demonstration now.
Farnswoth
thank you for coming.
why are these out?
Claudia pulled them to learn more about her new toy.
she just wanted to spruce up her far
right.
um, I'll lock them back up as soon as you leave.
you were vague on the phone.
tell me what you're feeling.
edgy.
unfocused.
and the headaches?
it's all right.
Mr. Valda knows you've been through an ordeal.
why am I having these headaches?
when MacPherson was part of your consciousness, he may have left something behind.
an echo.
this is Taka.
she's here to help us find out.
I mean, I have, like, over 5, 000 cds.
you don't have 5, 000 cds. - I do!
good morning.
Here--ooh, I'm sorry. Can I help you there?
there you go.
no, no, no. You're welcome.
that's-- have a nice day.
Yep, they still hate us.
Why?
maybe it's your cologne. - Well, I'm not wearing any.
that's so funny. You're hilarious.
look, making connections with strangers is never easy.
just relax. It'll happen.
hit the brakes, slick.
the Post Office is closed.
closed? - Yes.
it's 10: 00 in the morning.
government cutbacks. Everything was sold off or shipped out.
wait, wait, wait. What about my stuff?
I was supposed to come pick up my stuff this morning.
try the branch in Featherhead.- Well, Featherhead is 90 miles away.
take a bus. Read a book.
now wait--wait-- wait a minute, lady.
look, I'm in forced retirement.
going to make popcorn and watch movies on cable,'cause that's all I can afford to do on my government pension.
what's left of it, anyways.
Thanks.
What?"Thanks"? Thanks for what?
why do you people all hate us?
okay. Relax, okay?
just call the branch in Featherhead.
okay, Farnsworth, let's pimp you out.
Claudia, where are the schematics to the bronze section?
got Farnsworth gak?
what the hell are you doing?
you gave it to me. - You're tampering with perfection.
those are Warehouse issue. - These things need color, GPS, texting, and email is what they need.
need? They don't need!
they have their own secure frequency spectrum.
they can't be cracked, hacked, tapped or-- well, can I at least give it a better ringtone?
Oh, just give it a better ringtone?
Yeah. - No!
you know what you can give it? You can give it back.
no, no, no, no, no.
well then, button it up and learn to live with it.
fine. Living with it.
you see what happens?
Yeah, so if you could call me back, I would appreciate it. Thank you.
Featherhead voicemail?
one for Post Office, two for hunting licenses, three for county maintenance.
so I guess they'll either find my stuff or pump my septic tank.
Oh, great.
now this thing's on the fritz.
okay, let's go for a drive, shall we?
Yeah. I hear the middle of nowhere is beautiful this time of year.
come on, men. Let's kill what needs killin' and go home.
hang on.
we're not gonna die today, you understand me?
other guys are gonna die. A lot of 'em Tojo's boys.
but not us. Not if I can help it.
follow me, boys.
it wasn't me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
there's something wrong in town.
why does Artie want us to meet him here?
I don't know. You know, it was a terrible connection, and all I heard was "barber shop" and "emergency.
maybe his eyebrows are finally eating his face.
how on earth did you get a driver's license?
can you drive a stick shift?
no. - Then take a lesson.
Oh, you're a menace! - Well, in a good way.
Artie, my Farnsworth is making weird noises.
you see what you did?
what? You busted my Farnsworth?
No! - Now, who is a menace?
I only messed with mine.
well, that's the bad news.
what? What was that? - That is an alarm system.
if there's an artifact in town, then that would turn purple, and it turned purple.
this town has artifacts?
not normally, no.
but over the centuries, towns that host Warehouses have been given, well, certain kinds of protection, just in case.
and given recent events, an artifact may have been placed here to distract us from more, well, pressing pursuits.
Macpherson. - H. G. Wells. Part of the plan?
maybe. We'll see. First of all, let's get the artifact.
I want you to question the townies, find out if anything particularly unusual has happened, then snag, bag, and tag.
so you want us to go door to door?
we have a standard cover in Univille.
they think we're IRS agents?
and they think the Warehouse is an IRS storage facility that contains every U. S. tax return ever filed.
no wonder they hate us. We're tax collectors.
I hate us.
Oh, you even have their tax returns.
sure. Like that's a big stretch.
okay, so while we're dodging tomatoes, what are you gonna do?
s. I.S. Salinger inventory scan.
if an artifact is AWOL, the S. I.S. will I. D.It.
Salinger, like the author?
RTFM, dude.
Oh, read the f...manual. I like that.
Mr. Valda, I don't think employing the pearl of wisdom is our wisest move.
you know better than I the consequences that can come from using artifacts.
speed is of the essence.
you're looking for trouble.
I'm looking for clarity.
Irene, if something is buried deep inside Leena's subconscious, if MacPherson has left a residue that could help us understand what we're facing, then we must dig it out.
and we risk a woman's life.
to save many.
Mrs. Frederic, it's all right.
after all that's happened, I want to do this.
Leena. - Thank you.
and if something should go wrong?
Taka will make it right.
Marines. You saw Marines?
Yes, but like from World War II.
probably some guys playing dress-up like civil war nuts.
were they locals?
I've never seen them before. - Did you catch any of their names?
was there anything distinctive on their uniforms?
no. Yes!
a patch.
a wolf's head.
uh, how do you know they were Marines?
my grandfather was a Marine.
N--oh,'cause so was I.
Really? - Yes.
my grandfather... Hmm?
he was an evil bastard who emotionally tortured his children.
okay.
look, what does this have to do with my taxes?
well, um, if they were a profit-based...- If there was any kind of profiting...
...Based group of war re-enactors...- If they're acting about war...
then we would have to bring in some...
you mentioned seeing a flash of light.
this town has power problems. Transformers blow all the time.
sparks and brownouts. Nothing ever gets fixed.
we lost our Post Office.
I mean, how do you guys justify warehousing old tax returns when we're losing essential government services?
I mean, you guys are useless.
Hey, wait-- wait a minute, lady.
now you may not know this, but we're out there every day, trying to save your butt.
maybe today even.
saving my butt? - Yeah, that's right.
I'm still waiting for my bush tax credit.
who's your supervisor? I want a name.
Oh, I'm sorry. Here, let me spell it out for you.
U-n-c-l-e s-a-- Uncle Sam.
he's patriotic and he can spell. Isn't he cute?
well, uh, my apologies.
seriously, Kelly, you have no idea.
it's Dr. Hernandez.
whatever.
uh, thank you for your time.
hello.
customer.
I have a special... Order.
I was just working on a project that needs unworking.
can I get the name?
it's old copper wire.
um, a 20th century blend.
two-inch flange, one traverse.
um, and some old Mallory capacitors.
also, um, some half-watt 180k ohm Bradley resistors.
and you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
I heard "wire."
uh, let me check the file.
"Donovan," you said?
I. R.S.huh?
um, yeah.
I'll just have a look around.
so I just moved here. - Why on earth would you do that?
Yeah. Kind of a long story.
uh, th--that's the owner's apartment.
he doesn't like people to go up there.
he's kind of private.
wow, that's loud. - I know, right? Excuse me.
I can't find anything under that name, but...
uh, is everything okay?
No! The "R" is for "Revenue"!
there's no need for language like that.
strike 11.
all right, so no one else has seen anything.
maybe there's not an artifact.
you know, maybe Kelly the vet is one kitten short of a litter.
okay, William Siminski, lucky number 12, right across the street.
Yeah.
uh, you know what? If Claudia broke this
did you see that?
see that?
and we both see that.
afternoon, Jake.
never thought I'd see you in my town again.
Hey, he looks familiar.
more re-enactors?
this town belongs to me.
that's where you're wrong, Jake.
the only thing belongs to you after this day is a coffin.
now that's a good line.
holy crap.
was that for real?
well, it seemed like it a second ago.
were you hit?
no.
but I think my underwear is shot.
guys, I think I might be onto something.
sunspot activity and shifts in the Earth's mag field spanning 80 years, from the Wild West to World War II, might have actually left trace bioelectric
what?
at 10: 30 this morning, you futzed with the Farnsworths.
also at 10: 30, a town vet saw Marines.
and every even since then has started with Farnsworths squawking.
I fixed them. They're fine.
what about MacPherson or Wells stealing an artifact and hiding it in town?
dude, what's up with your S. I.S?
we scanned three times, Claudia. Nothing is missing.
well, it's not me.
Artie, there's not enough power between these Farnsworths to twitch a frog's leg.
until you started mucking with intricate circuitry. - Okay, okay, okay.
what if it's not the Farnsworths?
thank you.
just if, and if it's not, then it's still possible that there's an artifact in town that's generating some sort of power that's causing this, or it's drawing from another source.
theoretically.
all right, theoretically if it's not the Farnsworths, then we triangulate from the Marines, from the horses, from the cowboys, and it's somewhere, theoretically, in this area.
that's, like, four square blocks, Artie.
well, four square blocks we can focus on instead of, you know, running all around town.
Artie, can you please run another S. I.S. scan?
I suppose.
okay. And we will go back to "UN"-iville and hit these four square blocks hard.
I thought it was "You"-niville.
UN"-iville. Unincorporated town.
let's just get out of here before this thing escalates.
escalates how? - "Dangerously" comes to mind.
the amber acts as a governor controlling the pearl, which allows Taka to travel with it.
there will be less pain than before, but a little.
let's get it over with.
fascinating.
Yes.
let's see what's in there.
yo, Artie call you?
Yeah, a huge power drains at the hardware store. - So what's the layout?
two-story, one employee. A new guy named Todd.
owner's out of town, and when I went for the stairs, Todd warned me off.
bet whatever's sapping power is up there.
okay, so let's go around back.
you stay here, keep an eye out.
you think these things are still under warranty?
Yeah, I doubt it covers acts of Claudia. Just watch out for another light show.
what the hell?
holy mackerel.
Oh, dude.
dude! Dude!
I'm so sorry.
uh, don't move.
Hey, guys?
guys, there's something-- Okay.
qu'est-ce Que c'est?
Todd's boss is a video pirate.
selling illegal satellite feeds to the good folks of Univille.
this is the artifact?
no, no, this is a felony.
my Farnsworth barked. Something's coming.
I think it's here, downstairs. Something spooked Todd.
what did you do?
that thing you showed me. The--you know, the arm thing, maybe the leg thing.
I don't know. It just happened.
that's a tiger.
Yep. - Forgive me, brother.
and that--that's a gladiator.
not ghosts. Time travel?
Spartacus.
here, boy.
to the Gods, we are beasts that dance to their tune. Not anymore.
I've heard this speech before.
it is better to die a man, fighting for your freedom, than to die a slave, fighting for their pleasure.
Hey, weren't you just a cowboy?
Hey, be careful! Pete!
okay, I think it's real now.
Pete, get out of the way!
get out of here, guys, now!
Pete, no! - Pete!
Pete, no!
what happened?
a gladiator just kicked your ass.
Oh, good. For a second there, I thought a gladiator just kicked my ass.
No!
enough, Mr. Valda. You're chasing shadows.
something is throwing those shadows.
can you go deeper?
there's some risk.
then go carefully.
wait!
Irene. - I must be certain she survives.
Taka is-- Taka is out of her depth. I am not.
Lattimer and Bering, right?
they're so raw, so untrained, so corruptible.
James, are you there?
why is H. G. Wells here? What does she want?
Mrs. Frederic, you must tell me your secret.
I can't remember anything.
not much to remember.
you fell of a ladder and banged your head. Dropped your glasses.
you really work for the IRS?
actually, I work for a top secret organization that tracks down mysterious and powerful artifacts.
you're gonna audit me, aren't you?
maybe.
baby.
sadist!
Hey, maybe you can give him something, for, you know, the pain?
aspirin.
I think I saw some rolling around in my glove compartment.
Oh, well, maybe if I was a dog you'd be nice to me.
what is with you two?
man hater.
right.
okay, okay, so the gladiator is the cowboy is the marine.
yeah.- According to the description given by Dr. Bow-Wow.
so maybe we're looking for the medallion of the village people. I don't know.
Hey, you took the transmitter course at Rowley? - Sure.
okay. Do you remember the section on identifying aggressive frequencies?
Ah, here's a surprise. I don't.
okay. We know that these things go off before something happens, right?
so, what? We think they're causing it now?
no, I don't think they're transmitting anything, but
but maybe they're reacting to the signal, picking it up before it becomes a gladiator or whatever.
and maybe Claudia can turn them from reacting devices into locating devices.
Oh, God.
What'd I do now?
I knew we had a Farnsworth aisle.
Yes, which is off-limits to you, so, off--off-limits, which means, do not touch a thing?
you just tell me what you need to rig these two into signal locators, and I will get it.
I. Okay? - Got it.
okay, I need that.
Oh, okay. And that.
this?
and, uh, those. - That's awfully vague, Claudia.
those two right there. - Those. I've got it now. I have it now.
Ooh, and let me get a-- no, no, no, no! Oh, no, Claudia, no.
see, Farnsworth dabbled in nuclear fusion, and some of the things on this side of the aisle, they're still kicking.
still kicking?
you see what you find out when you include the old guy? Huh?
what, are you having a stroke?
you know what? Touch it. Go ahead.
touch it all.
okay.
MacPherson could have buried an artifact and repaved the road.
well, maybe Claudia's tweaked Farnsworths will help.
I hate maps.
I thought men loved maps, you know? So they don't have to ask for directions when they get lost.
well, you don't get to ask directions in basic training.
how long were you a Marine?
you're always a Marine.
but I never wore a patch.
wait. Kelly said they wore a wolf patch, right?
Yeah.
well, Marines don't wear patches.
Oh, man, come on. Come on!
what? Wait!
all righty.
good to go. - Good to go where?
Oh, uh, right. Do you want me to drive you?
God, no. Give me the keys.
Oh, uh, by the way, there's weirdness with item 186 in the Farnsworth aisle.
weirdness? What weirdness?
well, original manifest listed two parts to item 186 snagged in 1944, but there's only one part on the shelf: 186-B.
Jus--just-- where's 186-A?
I mean, if it was missing, then S. I.S. would have pinged.
and what does that half of the artifact do?
manifest doesn't say, but inventory records show 186-A was never shelved.
never?
so it was never here?
it must have been down on the loading dock for 70 years.
do we have a loading dock?
fire. The wolf was spitting fire.
Yeah. You better stay inside for a while, just to be safe.
safe? I mean, what's going on?
look, Kelly-- Dr. Hernandez.
Dr. Hernandez, please, stay inside, lock your door.
Fire-spitting wolf patch?
I mean, explain.
operation Dragon Wolf.
it played in heavy rotation on the 3: 30 movie back in Ohio.
I must have watched it, like, 100 times.
the lead Marine was played by an actor named Raymond St. James.
these are movies?
well, they're Raymond st. James movies.
he also played a few cowboys and a gladiator too.
1944.0
all right. So, 1944.
you're here somewhere.
project Gemini.
philo, you broadcasting madman.
trans mutational delivery device.
project Gemini army field test prototype.
a trans mutational camera to a receiving projector.
philo, what happened? - It wasn't, and then it was.
it was what?
real.
a projector camera.
186-A never made it here. It didn't even get here.
so, what? The shipping label tore off?
three-dimensional camera, check.
3-d projector, lost in the mail.
all right, I'm not promising anything.
okay, so what do we hope happens?
well, the screen should display a tapering arrow, okay?
the narrow end should point to the signal's origin.
that's the source of the transmissions.
what about the other end?
that's where trouble's likely to show up.
since the movies are getting more violent and more real, we'll want to avoid that.
Ooh, hot damn.
all right. Well, I guess the source is this way and the problem's that way.
okay.
more violent? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
if the problem's that way, Kelly's is that way.
Kelly, I need you to open the door.
you told me to keep it locked.
I know, but I need you to open it now.
will you make up your mind?
would you please just open the damn door?
God, what is with this chick?
look, I need you to get out of here.
it's dangerous.
it's back this way.
I don't see anything.
what kind of IRS agents are you?
rocky, scram! They're onto us!
Claudia, get her out of here!
Pete, we should go too! There's too many of them!
no, no, we're okay.
I know this movie, Dark Memento. After they shoot him, the bad guys take off.
rocky, listen.
no one's gonna know what happened here tonight.
you gotta be my mouthpiece, see?
Oh, he's about to die.
this is a great scene.
well, can't we change it?
I know, you don't do it for them.
no, it's no good.
this thing's on rails.
just stay out of the way and we won't get hurt.
you do it 'cause it's the right thing.
that's why we got into this lousy racket.
This--this, uh, this-- this film festival's chronological.
operation Dragon Wolf, Showdown at Laramie, Sword of the Gladiator
not his best work.
the next one is >Dr. Doomsday.
now get out there.
save the girl.
save the girl." Yeah!
okay, okay, so what happens in Dr. Doomsday?
Oh, really fun movie. He plays a mad scientist who blows up an entire town.
probably less fun if we all, you know, die.
so item 186 went dead letter?
what exactly is item 186?
well, 186-B is a camera in the Warehouse.
186-A is a transmutational delivery device.
it's supposed to transmit 3-D holographic images to the enemy, convince them that you're a lot closer and better equipped than they thought.
it worked, but...Too well.
it blew up in something called "Project Gemini" in 1944.
somehow light and matter coalesced and a 3-D projected Sherman tank became solid enough to shell the crowd.
how is that even possible?
you're still asking that question?
I'm still hoping for an answer.
Oh, dude, you're picking a lock. Can I do it?
no. - But it's been so long.
not long enough.
come on.
anyway, all I know is that the projector never got to the Warehouse.
I think that we can assume that it made it this far.
and somehow it's broadcasting the Raymond St. James Festival playing on movie classics unlimited.
Oh, I love that channel. - I know, right?
okay, since "how" isn't on the menu, do we have any idea "why"?
I don't know.
uh, signal flux, sunspots, uh...
intruding... - Wave diffraction... On the signal?
Yeah, maybe. All I know is, there's a pattern to the randomness.
I just don't know what it is yet.
Hey, guys, since we're here, can you keep an eye out for my stuff?
Oh, would you give that a rest, dude?
Hey, guys, over here.
the label's torn.
Yep. Stokes county, South Dakota.
enough to get it to the Post Office but no further.
do you remember what she said?
Yeah,"gonna eat some popcorn, watch some movies.
and who is "she"?
soon they'll know my power.
we'll return to the Raymond St. James marathon in just a moment.
don't go away. Dr. Doomsday is about to rock your world.
Yeah.
better than a flat screen.
hit the brakes, slick.
the darkness, the emptiness, that it's all for nothing.
MacPherson is still there.
no. It's him, but not him.
deep in her subconscious.
like grooves cut in vinyl.
you are the most unpredictable woman.
you must eradicate them.
smooth them over. Or she can go mad.
I'd seen the truth.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
Mrs. Frederic?
am I all right?
Yes. I believe you are now.
I didn't do anything wrong.
wait till you get your government pension check.
you'll take stuff home too.
Oh, yeah? Well, you stole the wrong package, lady.
okay, if the projector isn't plugged into the wall, then how is it being powered?
it's internal. Regenerative power... Source, the same as the... Farnsworths.
broadcasting on the same spectrum?
Mm-hmm, more than likely.
the movie's back on.
rest easy, my metal friend.
your labors are at an end.
doomsday's got a killer robot.
I went as that robot for Halloween.
Really? Was it recently? - Best candy haul ever.
the universe wants to be set free.
and he's got the bomb.
why don't we just cut the connection from the projector to the television?
does anyone have any better ideas?
...Humiliated or forced to stand by and watch men with puny minds steal my secrets.
as for imitators... Check.
solid core activator.
microwave.
intruding wave diffraction on the signal.
wait, is that what's kicking Raymond St. James out into the street?
make a lot of popcorn, do you?
well, how else do you watch a movie?
turn it back on. I want to see how it ends.
Yeah, well, you may have to live it, because we can't shut down every microwave and satellite dish in the state.
doomsday is here.
so, around here, right?
Yeah, it's-- that's what it says.
where?
I don't know. Maybe it's just a false alarm.
they thought I was mad!
mad! Now they shall all know my true genius!
it's not about cocktail parties and politics.
this thing is somehow buffering the input, and I think it's just gonna play the movie out, and then, when Dr. doomsday hits that button, boom!
kaboom!
we've got the camera. Why don't we just
interrupt this irregularly scheduled broadcast
by filming something benign-- and projecting our own drive-in movie.
it's in my car.
we can set it up in my Camino. - In whose Camino?
no, no.
how long do we have?
well, he's got about a three-minute monologue coming up, and then...
there is going to be an awful lot of life...
it looks like things are about to reach an explosive end after these words from the folks that pay the bills.
stay tuned.
well, we've got an extra three minutes.
well, unless someone fast-forwards through the commercials.
don't even joke about that.
Claudia, wait!
I got the parts you ordered.
it's not a question of madness.
okay, considering that the town's about to blow, we should probably use our guns. Just sayin'.
good point. Stay clear of the robot. He kills by crushing.
got it. Okay.
Seriously?
right. I forgot about the magnets.
what?
but the one constant through all of this...
how's this thing work?
well, just find something that looks like an "on" button and let's hope that the projector accepts the transmission.
now, focus on something benign.
not me!
I haven't been benign since 1956.
okay. Wait. What?
Why--why--why does the robot have your guns?
well, he kind of just reached down and took them.
all right, all right, all right!
just--you can sit this one out.
what? - It's fried!
Oh, no. The misfire in 1944 must have-- can you--?
wait.
give me your Farnsworths! Your Farnsworths, right now!
I can cannibalize these for parts.
no, we're gonna need five Farnsworths to fix this damage.
we're totally screwed.
I am going to destroy that glue.
here comes his big speech!
do you guys really work for the IRS?
what is that? - The parts you ordered. Found 'em.
you're a wonder twin!
here. - Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, you guys, hurry up.
there's only 15 more lines before kablooey!
resistor.
now would be nice. - Resistor. Thank you.
my reach extends far beyond this realm.
I will destroy everyone you love.
Wha--wha--what's-- what's the matter?
why "uh-oh"?
Artie, he changed his signature!
meaning what, exactly?
it's a totally different layout.
I'd have to reverse it. I need the Farnsworth blueprints.
no, no, they're locked in tech.
but I was just taking a gander at them back at Leena's.
well, I've got 'em-- well, here.
I mean, I read them this morning.
photographic memory? Me too.
who is this guy?
later. Farnsworth.
okay, imagine five of these, okay?
staggered diagonally, this section right here inverted, so how do I--?
you put that one there, and then you run-- you run this to there.
right, right.'Cause that would connect those two.
brilliant.
death takes many forms. I have created a few more myself, but then
what's the matter?
I need a fusible link! I don't have a fusible link!
what's fusible? Maybe I have one. - The car battery!
if you intended to make your life better-- yours, what then?
hurry up, guys!
are they to be removed, erased, eradicated? Yes.
Yes, of course.
okay, he's almost out of dialogue!
it's the countdown!
Oh, that's it! Here it is!
come on! I need that wire!
make the connection!
you have made me do this.
do something!
what's happening?
we connected a blue wire.
I have become... Death.
Claudia, I--good job.
any chance that went out to the entire Raymond St. James fan club?
I gave up Raymond St. James for this?
so that's how the power is generated.
I bet if I spend some time with this thing, I could rig it so I don't need to recharge.
maybe you should hold off on mentioning that to Artie.
good thought.
so, Claudia... - That's a scary tone.
Todd's cute. - Todd who?
this is me ignoring you.
I smell popcorn.
who wants to watch I Return to Kill, starring our new favorite actor?
you have got to be kidding me.
Yeah, I think I've seen enough of that dude's movies to last me a lifetime.
wussies. In my room in five, okay?
remember, I have a big flat screen.
well, item 186, Philo Farnsworth's parts A and B are right back where they-- ooh, popcorn.
deal me in. - Sure.
how else do you watch movies?
you know, if we want any of that popcorn...
so, about Todd... - Hey, wait up.
so, but he's really cute.
I might have to cut you.
guys, wait up.
we talked about it.
well, I think he's maybe, I don't know... The answer is no.
he may have left something behind.
an echo.
is that what you're looking for?
Pete! - What?
they're very old.
an account number not party to investigative
not party to investigative
well, I like it. Looks good.
he was ready for my trace.
Hey, Jeff. Agent Pete Lattimer.
well, the bank teller heard it here.
excuse me?
if we just follow...
enjoy Chicago.
in Chicago.
at midwesterner bank on grand.
whatever you can.
for this, I blame Jed Fissel.
that's him.
uh, he lives there.
suspicion of bank robbery.
and I forwarded the phones.
office of Daniel Dickinson U. S. Secret Service HQ
same notes. Exactly the same.
she sas hays.
so I'm returning the favor.
Yes.
I screwed up, okay?
not yet.
I'm staying.
not possible.
Where's my phone?
the guy who actually made the recording,
Work-for-hire stuff.
he said he was looking for the key.
angel's kiss," "a night in my arms."
I'm Mrs. FredEric .
Hello, Laura.
for leaving disaster in your wake.
where?
around the other banks.
of this song,
forgot something?
Yeah.
do you have a suspect?
is he playing somewhere?
to see Marsden.
is it yours?
humping my leg.
I am not interested.
Oh, jeez.
we're here.
is it there? - No.
and it bounces off the tiles,
I don't know.
and the other one loses an ear.
is I'm taking sounds and putting them through
or he's gonna start screaming.
you don't get invited.
Oh, well, you know, lights can do that.
it's kind of like they have
she doesn't even know it.
but, hey, go for it.
I don't remember anything else.
no, no, no, no, no.
Where's Myka?
you gotta be kidding me.
about the warehouse,
okay, are you saying that they - Here you go. - Thank you.
Yeah, but we heard it too.
Lattimer.
Eric Marsden.
leave the Farnsworth.
no, no, no, not yet.
if you'll excuse me,
stop it.
how about that?
I love it.
they've been acting up all morning.
does he have any family?
to ruin the world's day,
so how you guys doing?
I'd go to see him.
so if you're looking for a criminal,
he's canceling it.
and protectors of secrets.
experimental stuff.
so I chucked his debt.
don't. - Wasn't.
okay, there's a big difference
I guess so.
Why?
what are you talking about?
well, I'm...I'm sorry.
one of them gets rich,
I have a date with a forward pass.
so...
this guy's in Chicago.
someone once told me
and why is that?
he's making a what?
you can start with Marsden.
so there's a record.
he's very good.
you're driving. - Bingo.
somewhere in South Dakota
and sure hell no vibrating,
whatever it is you're selling,
for a day, okay?
Yeah.
the rich and powerful list.
she started a new family a long time ago.
yeah?
we're setting up
through the robber's equipment.
we're on this.
stolen how?
he's making a love connection.
who indeed?
I was ordered here.
nothing.
heads up! - What?
Thanks.
dad won't miss me.
Yeah. - The rest should be easy.
okay?
until she, you know, pulled the pants off...
something, you know,
this is Eric.
looks like somebody
so what's going on?
thank you, Stephanie.
that you need.
like no one else.
four hours to rush hour.
except the banks in Chicago
Hello?
F. B.I.
just don't take it personally.
mostly, they're a pain in my ass.
don't worry about it.
Yep.
or whatever that thing does, do it.
Chicago Fidelity Mutual Bank
ahem, where's, uh...
finally.
Oh, me? Sure.
no, no, I'm talking about something
so am I.
might be involved.
you're working for me.
jed Fissel?
into one of their pockets.
I need tech out here right now.
who's this?
understood?
I already told you everything.
inside their music.
yeah?
so how they doing?
my Dad took me to the blue note in new york
recall any orders or demands from these robbers?
your timbre will bug him.
that's why Copeland sounds like Copeland.
why are you here?
what happened?
Oh, come on.
Chi-town!
Yes, she is.
and the right rear tire is walled.
Laura.
Myka, are you there?
let's just... get Fissel talking,
why not?
I'm thrilled you're on the team.
they're using a record player.
it's okay. - Yeah, yeah.
what was that?
how about 12 miles south of the robberies?
Myka nailed him.
well, whatever you're wearing,
experimental self-indulgence
and cell phones off... no ringing.
you want to use my computer
something strange.
he also wrote, uh...
I can't even access... you know what?
what?
you know, like a strobe can do that.
um, the boss was wondering
her history doesn't bother you?
so where's his music now?
I made the deposit.
where is my phone?
I found your cell phone.
I think you should turn it off.
Pete.
look, you gave us the sound thing,
in a terrible deal.
and find out exactly in which
ignore him.
but that was years go.
that hasn't been robbed.
he's just...fishing,
this is his music.
Why?
but, I mean, they're old!
so can I have your attention now?
and you sound spectacular?
and I'm right...
at the edge of the visual spectrum.
Hey, look, uh...
well, where do we find him?
I got hit with it.
that's why the Beatles sound like the Beatles.
let alone be able to make it this far?
whatever... what I'm doing here
nice catch.
felt her.
Y-yet. - Yes.
Stephanie.
we're with the government.
and we're gonna play it for you,
it's entirely professional.
Yeah, they can.
I made a call.
Laura was one of the tellers.
well, but what if it goes down,
no, I never sound spectacular.
so it looks like the boss man fell off
well, I would guess you'd have to hear it
agent Bering.
all right, none of these witnesses
Sam Martino.
this bank fits the bill.
who the...
okay.
you okay?
to buy his stuff.
who's there? - Make it stop!
everything fell apart.
well, do any of these tapes have sound?
when I was eight,
I traced packets through network systems all over the world,
Yeah, yeah, that's him.
Hey, so was that your Dad
I'm officially ranked.
to poke around in your problem?
so...
I'm not wearing perfume.
apparently, Martino and your partner
is one of Marsden's songs?
this is warehouse 13.
all your old contacts are off-limits.
so I guess this ain't much different.
who wants it?
it resonates inside the banks.
h-hold the line, please.
and they're all over the city.
that's right.
Thanks.
but maybe not.
the key to what?
so...
but...but don't make this my fault.
two. Great.
I know, I know, Mom.
I don't know how the robbers are doing it.
blah blah blah.
jed Fissel.
it's a gray van, no windows, no plates, - What about children? - One kid.
you two have a reputation
what? No, I just...
to the sounds on the tape.
any idea which one might be next?
and Artie got his hands on it.
Ah, I didn't see that.
a lot of research.
I'm not seeing it yet.
don't ask.
you know, I did a lot of work,
based on what?
said it was a matter of...
I don't want it.
one was a woman. - You sure?
then get the hell out of my office!
well, that's 'cause you were too busy
not Daniel Dickinson. Me.
what is it with men and their balls?
we have ways.
and most of it sounds like bricks in a blender.
meet the FBI
he bought into Eric's search for a new sound
Hey, you did something different with your hair.
everyone's shy on the details.
well, if I say anything else,
what do you guys want with my robberies?
I gotta take this.
save a penny, earn a penny.
you get shoved.
Artie...
national security.
Chicago, Last Friday
see, what I'm thinking
he hasn't touched it in years,
haven't talked in years.
he isn't selling these days.
everything is right here,
you're looking for an original recording
he was into jazz then.
well, I'm...I'm sorry,
all composers leave a DNA
how are you sleeping?
marble and stone and big, high ceilings.
is unaccounted for.
canning stole his music rights - Okay? Belski has a vibe. - Do you?
it's a nice leg.
all right?
like mad.
and so are Lattimer and Bering.
between the video's interlaced frames.
and reading warehouse data files?
this crew knows the way in and out of these areas
on three successive Fridays at rush hour...
I just...I have a lot going on right now.
a little bit. - No.
no, it's something unreleased.
Fridays...
I'm not leaving.
Let...no.
I used to love going to lessons.
it's mine.
okay, I'm scrubbing the sound for the melody.
look, what's this all about?
hunt down whatever is threatening
flash Gordon?
at the n. s.a. would have missed it too.
I think this is a completely new score.
banks just hand over the money.
look, I managed to get my cell phone
and this...this music
no, they... they don't recall anything.
what's with the getup?
just hold it right there.
so what happened?
this is my office.
Todd, hi.
but I think you know who I represent.
do you see that? - Oh, really?
my Dad was just nuts for those guys.
they're all marble and stone.
and I should have figured that out, and I didn't.
those streets are jammed,
Hey, Kelly.
so if you want to...
when I was there, he didn't know I was there.
bought and sold libraries,
Hello, Mr. Jarvis.
is knocking people sideways because...
who said you sounded like a bar maid?
where pollen from a prehistoric plant
I backed him up on over 50 records,
against all the banks in the Chicago area
she heard it there for the second time.
drop it, Pete.
let me work it from here.
that's...
I'm just saying that you could have come to me
the lizard part of the brain
she does.
Deenie, I gotta go.
don't ask me how. I don't know.
course, if you want to better it, it's yours.
and this sounds like my Dad's favorite song.
Eric...
that's coming in through...
are just giving it away, right?
hmm, you go that from ogling the help?
she's wound pretty tight.
all right, you listen to me.
Hi, Mom.
they played a sound.
jed Fissel, - Myka... - Yeah?
what about Eric Marsden's music?
Pete, what did you say?
with something you wrote.
I don't know, crankier than usual?
are you sure?
and he won't break through the zetac
we're gonna need more. The situation's changed.
so let's go strike while the butt is still hot.
Mr. Marsden?
you're dripping on my floor.
might have fallen on hard times, huh?
that will probably never see the light of day.
last month, he was diagnosed with liver cancer.
okay, well, I guess we'll just
Hi, I'm Jeff Canning.
Artie, I need you to find my cell phone.
uh, no, I...
I mean occasionally.
no, he's dying of cancer.
a tonal deconstruction algo...
uh, give me a second.
Oh, you should see my balloon animals.
well, the warehouse keeps us busy.
it's not even twitching, so...
mom, I can't, okay?
Chi-town.
Where's the record?
I didn't hack you.
so he let go.
an anonymous buyer.
stay away from my investigation.
on his wife's cell phone.
how much time does he have left?
costs more to market
something the public has never heard until now.
we take the dangerous and unexplained
well, money's tight all over.
Eric was never the same after that.
his music, local crime scenes.
yeah? What did that cost you?
just tell them what you told me.
talk to Mr. Canning.
not possible.
Yeah, well, we know three banks have been robbed
Hi. What's going on?
let's go.
hard enough to rob banks?
and we're not there?
Hi, Mom.
I'm sorry you got hit.
no, I'm enhancing it.
you found the person hacking into the warehouse?
a couple grand.
you know, just...
what about Marsden? Is he still a suspect?
no, we just lost a suspect.
no, no, they're all silent.
find it and tell us where we need to go.
so you just tell us what you think,
whoever you are, if you're gonna kill me
been off the grid for six months.
I was going over the rush hour traffic patterns
destroying their hard work.
my agents won't like you
he's kind of fallen out of fashion.
windy Lake Records?
and I've got the only key.
except maybe cab drivers.
you feel okay?
that's never been released until now.
an external server.
and I could have got you whatever information
it's at your feet.
somebody overheard what was happening in there, right?
you've got to...
you can take off. - Half days?
uh, anonymous buyer.
that's what the music needs to work.
She...she did her best.
dead? - Unknown.
windy Lake Records. This is Stephanie.
there's three suspects, including Fissel.
are we looking for souped-up speakers
okay, but, Artie, who would even know
without guns.
what team? What is this place?
not long.
that people needed to hear.
it's no secret the industry's going through
my name... it doesn't matter.
stolen. Ask me, that's what broke him.
whoever did this mirrored these 12 proxies
and she was unaware that she was doing that
canning said he had a buyer.
Oh, god, they're robbing the...
but don't make this my fault, okay?
Oh, no.
don't forget, who's your Daddy?
well, I bet there's an entire floor of analysts
do you still have those earplugs?
warehouse 13...
Yeah, okay. Hold on, freeze.
ex-wife. She got remarried.
I got it.
which is strange.
the agent who died in the shootout,
lock it up. I need video.
secret service is on us now.
Oh, well...you don't...
the hell are you?
he doesn't hear you.
if you'd mailed his all-access pass this year.
Hey, Kelly. Made the deposit.
but if you're gonna talk about things that make no sense,
all right, Mr. Whoever-you-are,
good.
think we'll just have to...
between, you know, seeing something
what's this?
Laura...
Hey, Pete.
and lock it away right here.
there's a pattern.
who want to take away your scissor privileges.
sir?
Well...well, that's good.
so will he talk to us?
Yes.
hey...you all right?
writing and mixing and playing,
heads up.
got your 30 minutes. I suggest you not waste it.
Oh, for crying out...
you know...good as new.
try the pizza.
you never did me that favor.
they hit us with the music and took him.
you have to stop.
Artie, I need the other side of that phone call.
trying to get into my computers.
1960-something.
just get me phone guy's name.
Hey, Leena.
any kind of flashing... - But nothing's flashing, Artie.
but I do have an offer on the table
I've got some pissed off agents here
short-term memory loss or something.
your aura looks like hell.
we'd like to speak with Eric Marsden, please.
a chromatic DNA inside their compositions,
what for?
Yeah, well, is there any way that we could...
Bonnie Belski, Chicago F. B.I.
I want my grilled cheese now.
like a...a close 'n play.
stay safe. - We'll do.
director's a terrible poker player,
to just plain weird.
he couldn't write anymore.
you know how when you sing in the shower,
so where are we?
you ask the questions. Not you.
rhythm.
but I always keep it tuned.
ever heard of Jeff Canning?
windy Lake Records
thank you.
did you see it?
witnesses, or leads you might have.
a few changes.
my limbic's not triggered.
I...I suspect it's a collector in Japan.
uh, you're both joining me as fellow gatherers
do you remember hearing anything?
well, he's bipolar.
that I have the voice of a bar maid.
what the hell was that?
and see who you are.
it's okay, I got it.
find this record, and go home.
you give the word and everything happens.
no, no, no, no, no.
we're missing something that we're not seeing.
that we think might be connected
find this guy the old-fashioned way.
Myka, watch out!
you represent.
she never lost a match.
all right, give my best to Myka.
show it to me. Show it to me.
uh...Yeah.
you know, I never heard of Eric Marsden.
how's the money? - Laundered and ready to go.
rush hour. - No, besides that.
I think this is his music.
I don't do that anymore.
Oh, yes, she does.
I'll put a trace on them
they spent way too much of my money looking for it,
the magazines are three months old.
you're to be in south Dakota at noon tomorrow.
so go, go, go.
okay, so what are we looking for, Artie?
you know, he lived in the studio,
I made a lot of deals over the years.
it was never about the money.
possibly in a silver case.
Yeah, but we weren't affected.
and ran the breach through here.
I like your perfume.
and thanks... for playing the piano.
and I found out there's another robbery in Chicago.
give me...one...
no, no, you son of a...
the offices near the elevator are empty.
ahem, we would like access to any evidence,
it's hard to when you're on the phone every 30 minutes.
how long does it take to find a security tape?
do you know how they're doing this?
I'm in love.
subsonic security systems.
the FBI is staking out the Midwesterner on grand.
we're gonna open the door
and what can I do for the government today?
if I'm right...
until I finally figured out
let me be clear. I'm your boss now, hey?
you hit a roadblock, you call me, I remove it.
what? No, I'm fine.
during this entire robbery.
and we think that something that Marsden wrote
I had a crush on my piano teacher.
I'm not breathing heavy.
it's like that, huh?
that affects people,
well, somebody's robbing banks in Chicago.
the network intrusion came from Washington?
the banks are all like that, Artie.
Eric didn't care about the money.
it's per a federal wiretap law, lest we overhear
ready?
Buddy...you got punk'd!
I didn't know you played.
go be with your family.
she's outside on her phone.
the human heart.
well...I mean, you traced it this far.
see what?
Why? - Doesn't matter.
that her case just kicked her in the ass.
and seeing something.
I did. I added some color.
but his sound engineer, Jed fissel,
Eric Marsden's recording engineer.
and semi-catatonic.
I'm rankled. Hey?
Artie Nielsen, you can call me Artie.
you're putting that back together, right?
warehouse 13!
loved.
Artie, there's a man on his cell phone
we're looking into some trouble
last known address, Fultondale, Alabama.
six hours to rush hour.
okay? You satisfied?
it's good to hear it again.
all his hits, his misfires,
you never asked.
aren't you arts and crafty?
Eric's engineer.
he's mak...
hot damn.
it will be ok. Stevie.
I mean, it's none of my business anyway, right?
that connects to the pleasure centers, see?
jed Fissel...
amplified by the bank's designs.
then stop looking at it.
Belski just got spanked.
thomas Edison's what?
and it is Friday.
I know that you did it.
tell me something I don't know.
Mr. Canning, your lunch date's here.
we both know Dad's never letting go of that bookstore.
you touched her boobies?
she had to bring him home.
what's the problem?
Oh, you know, they're...
the FBI has company.
uh, so where's Fissel now?
me too.
they're not our problem.
so the guy on the phone was leaving a message
Yeah, what, the bank robbery remix?
Oh, if I had a nickel.
that it?
so you two are going to Chicago to find out.
I...I can't remember anything else.
except for a few, specific, not-well-known routes.
so she had a strong emotional reaction
new age crap.
is there something you wrote
look, we're here to help.
okay? So just...
call it a retirement party all you want.
Artie, Artie, where is she?
his daughter.
where, together, you almost lose the president?
than you could ever get in return.
how long have you and Bering been partners?
FBI Headquarters, Chicago
wanna ask the recording engineer?
so get to it. It's almost lunch.
I said that it sounded like my Dad's favorite song.
anyone can find his stuff in flea markets, - Um, agent... - Bering and Lattimer.
wait for your call then.
Oh, god.
was made from a petrified narwhal's horn.
Laura, these are agents Bering and Lattimer.
welcome to warehouse 13.
Where's Jed and Stephanie?
I've been his caretaker going on five years now.
and now Canning is sitting on everything.
Artie's tracing my phone.
Dickinson. - Daniel Dickinson.
how does someone get invited to your party?
when my voice went, I needed something to do.
agent Belski will be more cooperative now.
Artie, what are you gonna do?
by two suspects employing a takeover technique
uh, Mary, queen of Scots' croquet mallet
something scared these people stupid, Artie.
tell my mother to stop making me do her dirty work.
well, I have a few questions about an artist
you know, um, I had a case once
thousands of hours of music.
but, you know, if my Dad were alive,
turned a woman into a sexually rapacious sleepwalker.
I don't know. A-a bomb or something?
why these banks, these branches?
then you get exiled off the reservation into my town,
were having an affair, and he was married.
your own agency doesn't even know why you're here.
jumpy much?
are you okay? I-i-is Pete okay?
working. Okay, bye.
Denver?
no exceptions! Warehouse security demands it.
a third bank was robbed on Friday
peace, something.
let's go see Mr. Canning, shall we?
ask her about Jed fissel.
so clearly, there is a sense memory component.
F. B.I! Stop!
she missed her father.
I'm gonna recycle you both for parts!
I can't tell you what I do, exactly.
I'm working on it, but if there's a link,
we have to call the FBI.
Artie, uh, just be... be quiet.
and, uh, you're sure about this too?
what always happens when an artist meets a con man.
Mr. Lattimer, I'm with the government.
what I need is 30 minutes alone with this terminal.
it's that computer, your computer right over there
that fit the acoustic profile of the already-robbed banks.
someone just...broke right through the firewalls.
in Yinchuan,
everything.
Yeah, like, that hurts.
I got hacked!
we haven't met.
and interior dimensions of fidelity mutual
Hi, guys. Nice ties.
last I heard, he was driving a cab downtown.
fine, go. Play footsie with the FBI.
he lost his music. He lost his daughter.
of a cell phone call that occurred during the robbery.
they love the bubble gum.
okay, I need you to compare all the architecture
a bad shootout in Denver gets you shipped to D. C.
or it's a very old composition
dusting off Shakespeare at your Dad's bookstore.
you have a beautiful voice.
with a ninety...
what is it you do, exactly?
no. - Then I say they're wrong.
there's scuttlebutt.
so the breach came from secret service?
uh, resale shops, peer-to-peer networks.
no, see, this little guilt trip you're taking me on
okay, I don't think we're getting the tape.
a little...shock.
Oh, right, I...
Chicago again?
a little affected by the music.
it is exactly...two.
but ultimately, my job is to get the music out there.
snag it, bag it, and tag it.
wh-what are you... what are you doing?
there was nothing left for him to hold on to.
okay, I'll get back to you as soon as I can, all right?
ms. Bering, Mr. Lattimer,
a song, possibly.
Canning's assistant.
you had to go and call Dickinson to get access?
you gotta stop her! - Someone's there, I can...
Laura?
Lattimer.
don't you want to find Myka's cell phone?
I say this guy just hit the top of your suspect chart.
okay. Call me if you get something.
federal agent! stop!
part of the homeland security thing?
it was never about the money.
are you...are you gonna play something?
I fell loved
well, separated, but still.
I'm not. - I could tell.
we needed access, Artie, not information.
okay, Mr. Knock-Knock,
the targeted banks have the same acoustic profile.
you can run through proxy servers
I feel...
Myka, the world will survive without you
Uh...Kodak Moment.
Pete and Myka's ex-boss.
Yeah, except it wasn't over in two hours.
maybe a year.
Belski doesn't seem too bothered by the fact
okay, we have a copy of a recording
Yeah, I...
okay, okay. Lucky shot, lucky shot.
I tip my hat to you, sir!
I, uh...
does Artie seem a little...
I'm fine, Pete's still, uh...
So...something in the source material is...
that is our problem.
Uh,"center of my soul" by the Bricktones,
please, sit down.
and blow your house down.
okay, the number of un-robbed banks
does corporal punishment work on computers?
Yeah, the sound rings a bell in the primal,
maybe.
an "ear" witness.
the bank robberies?
I'm not your personal cell phone locator, okay?
no, nothing.
we just have a couple questions.
with the tough Dad and the scared kids.
Eric went from pop to jazz to experimental
eight point three probability.
now that I'm in your face, you ask nicely.
did you write that piece of music, Eric?
Belski will find them.
Laura, when the suspects robbed the bank, - Yeah. - Put them in.
why'd you do it? What do you want?
Mrs. FredEric will pop out and go all scary-face on me.
I'm looking, Artie. Just give me a second.
you make it sound so, um...cozy.
my name is Myka. This is my, uh, friend.
doing what, exactly, Pete?
pond this scum is resides,
but you cannot...hide.
what has agent Belski done for you lately?
with a ninety-eight point seven probability.
directly from his office computer.
wh-what is inside that one's coat?
I am gonna huff and puff
Artie, I got him.
if you ask nicely, he might give you the other two.
could you at least...avert your eyes, all right?
is that this is a limbic trigger.
or Thomas Edison's wax cylinder?
okay. - All right, thank you.
okay, look, my family is having a party...next week.
uh, 432 Argyle street.
you ever see that movie "the Great Santini"?
I mean, I'm not explaining this very well.
that initiated the security breach into my business.
makes them...happy.
Yeah. Um...can I talk to Dad?
we'd like to ask you a...few questions.
thank you for remembering our appointment.
how could you possibly have survived?
the Phoenix?
harriet Tubman's thimble-- it was me? Mrs. Frederic, it was me.
the worst case of identity theft ever.
it's not her fault.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
that's a great color on you, ma'am.
hello.
you're never gonna win these people over.
they will succumb to my charms, Myka. They will succumb. Hello!
What--whatever!- Come on!
call me.
it's just bull!
joy.
is it Tuesday again already?
uh, yes.
kiss, kiss to you, Brenda.
you got our stuff or what?
Finally!
it only took six months.
shipped in from D. C. this morning.
what, are you taking deliveries from the mob?
what's the "O" for?
uh... Olive?
olive oil? Olive Garden?
so not telling you. Whatever.
wait, hey, hey, B,B!
what about my stuff?
sorry, slick. That's it. - Wha-- wha
if you don't mind...I'm watching a movie, and I don't have the TiVo.
it's my books, my music, my fuzzy slippers.
Yay! - Yay.
sorry.
they sit there, Arthur, and they hoard the things that can save the world.
you've had your chance, Arthur.
so many chances! You always hurt the one you love.
Arthur? - Artie? Hey, you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
you sure? 'Cause for a second there, you seemed untethered.
weren't you supposed to be helping, uh, Leena install the rest of the new motion detectors?
getting to it.
getting to it? Claudia, if the Warehouse is vulnerable, then we are vulnerable.
and we are not going to be vulnerable ever again.
and there are other threats out there.
who, H.G. Wells?
sister friend kind of did us a favor by killing - Killing... does no one a favor.
that's why we have teslas, not bullets.
that's why ethics are codified in the-- Saved by the beep.
looks like we got a ping. You want me to rally the troops?
no, what I... What I want is for you to help Leena install the rest of the new motion detectors.
aye aye, Captain Bligh.
Hello, Motor City.
now, that's something I never expected to see.
Yep, yep, yep.
she must have found an artifact that makes her act like a girl.
hmm, her aura... It's just so... - Happy?
these things hold special memories for me.
you know? It makes me feel like I'm, uh... Home.
we interrupt this concert... to bring you your regularly scheduled job.
all right, first this mugger is delivered to Detroit Metro police, and he's in a twisted streetlight.
look at that. He's in a coma.
and then this drug dealer-- he is found dangling from this flagpole-- pretty high up too.
he's in a coma as well.
and by the time it takes to print these photos, our mysterious assailant strikes again.
a person did this? With what?
if I knew that, I wouldn't be sending you both to Detroit.
plane's in an hour.
skedaddle.
Ah, listen, I know things are awkward between you and Claudia, but I need you working together and over it.
don't talk to me. Talk-- just get it done.
Oh... Now, that is a big hole.
so, officer Kessman, according to the reports, you were the first on scene at all three incidents?
Yes, ma'am.
I was out walking my beat, and I hear three shots fired, followed by a loud crash.
and that's when I look up, and I see the hole.
but not what caused - no, ma'am.
fortunately, the occupants are out of town, so the only casualty's the perp.
okay, well, thank you. We'll take it from here.
Yeah.
three shots fired...
no blood... No bullet holes.
Hey.
check these out.
bullets. - Yes, Bob.
at least they used to be. Investigators didn't find these?
investigators?
with all the recent cutbacks, we're lucky we still have guns. Welcome to my world.
Kevlar?
no way a vest would flatten a slug that much-- that's just freaky.
welcome to our world.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hey, Claudia!
Jeez! Jeez, Leena. Skulk much?
Artie wants us to finish putting these sensors up.
well, I'm doing this instead.
okay, look. Do you want to just get it off your chest right now?
my chest is burden-less.
can't you tell by reading my aura?
I don't have to read your aura to know that you're pissed off at me.
going back to work now.
neighborhood watch meets here once a week.
might be because Loretta organized the group, and she makes the best pies in the Midwest.
Pete, he said pie.
I know. I just want to make sure everything's Jake on the home front first.
I'll be right there.
thank you.
look, all's I'm saying is you want to make an omelet, you got to crack a few skulls.
and I'm saying there are other ways to keep this neighborhood safe than vigilantism.
right, Sheldon?
I've read that there are two types of criminals-- parasites and cowards.
Amen, brother.
like that. Boom
what?
look, cranky's kind of your natural state of being, isn't it?
what, please?
three squashed bullets, okay?
w-we think the artifact has some kind of a bulletproof invulnerability.
Yeah, no, that wouldn't explain the hole in the wall.
well, what if whatever it is, it does a bunch of different stuff?
doubtful.
okay. Well, maybe Claudia can do a little, you know, tippy-typy
look, Pete, could you just figure it out? You're a big kid now. All right? I got to go.
okay, look, Artie, this is a little too crotchety, even for you. What's going on?
I'm sorry, it's nothing. It's just that I have a little... Rodent problem.
um, I'll have Claudia explore the invulnerability theory, all right?
detroit's almost finest.
officer Kessman... Large mochaccino and a slice of Pumpkin to go?
Ah, not today, Loretta.
this is Agent Bering, Secret Service.
hello. - I'm her partner, Agent Lattimer. Howdy.
is the President in town?
no, no, we're just here on a local matter, and we could use the neighborhood watch's help.
the authorities need our help? That's not a good sign.
Yeah. - Well, I have to run to the bank.
I'll be right back, but you can talk to Sheldon.
he works with the watch.
two slices of the lemon meringue for the Agents, please.
Oh, you know what? I'm more of a... Twizzlers gal myself, but thanks.
but, uh, I'll take her-- her slice.
so what are you guys looking for?
anything strange or unusual.
Yes.
you know, something that could... Twist a street lamp or... Put a hole through a brick wall.
you see anything like that that fits the bill?
uh, no.
sorry. Haven't seen anything.
but I'll definitely keep my eye out.
okay, then.
if you don't mind... My city needs me.
you know, Dudley Do-Right was first on the scene at all three locations.
Yeah. He's also P. O. 'd about the cutbacks, and he likes to do things his own way.
maybe he's doing things his own way with an artifact.
we should probably... - I think we should.
Oh, uh, I'm gonna... Take these with me. Thank you so much.
what do you think he's got?
I don't know. Wyatt Earp's badge, maybe?
that's a good theory, Olivia.
game on.
I'm gonna go check out the bedroom.
Hey, up there-- the window's been broken.
freeze, Dirty Harry! - Surrender the artifact!
artifact?
what are you talking about? And what the hell is that thing?
what did you use to mop the floor with these guys?
I didn't do this. - Sure you didn't.
we got an anonymous tip, and I come run
no freakin' way! - Help me! Please!
okay, just put him down nice and slow.
who was that masked man?
that was no man.
that was a superhero.
Pete, that was not a superhero.
no, that was the Iron Shadow. - The Iron Shadow?
Yeah. Only the most "awesomest" character of the silver age.
you grew up in a bookstore. How do you not know that?
real books, not cartoons!
Yeah, comic books!
a guy in tights just leaped over a building.
Yeah, best to omit that from your report.
what report?
all right.
okay, that mask he was wearing looked kind of artifact-y.
maybe that's where he's getting those powers from.
no, the Iron Shadow doesn't have powers.
he's just a regular guy trained to be the ultimate urban Samurai.
okay, even ultimate urban Samurai can't leap over buildings, okay?
whoever that was has an artifact.
we should have Claudia check the Warehouse database.
no need-- you're looking at a one-man Iron Shadow encyclopedia. Pick an issue, any issue.
I think we already know your issues, okay?
so officer Kessman said he got an anonymous tip, right?
I bet you dollars to doughnuts where that call came from.
doughnuts or pies.
best in the Midwest.
see, now I want doughnuts.
since when does the Secret Service investigate petty crimes?
just open the safe.
do you have any idea what this woman means to this community?
Sheldon, it's okay. - No, it's not.
you go after good citizens like Loretta?
I was robbed at gunpoint in my apartment.
bastards took my clothes, my computer, my collection--everything.
we all feel unsafe.
we just want somebody to do something about it.
there... Knock yourselves out.
what does this do?
it's a key.
it opens things.
you, uh--you may want to cover your eyes.
no? - Nothing. Nothing.
guess the Iron Shadow doesn't use keys.
wait, the Iron Shadow?
Yeah. - Like the comic book?
Yeah, yeah, there's some guy running around town.
we're very sorry.
sorry to bother you. - Sorry. Sorry.
thank you for your time. - Thank you. Bye.
Hello, square one... We meet again.
okay, okay. Let's just think this through, okay?
you're Joe Shmoe.
you find an artifact that gives you superpowers. What do you do?
I track down Ralph Brunsky and give him the mother of all atomic wedgies in front of the entire seventh-grade class.
or I don the guise of my all-time favorite superhero and use my powers to fight crime.
okay, okay. So--so... Where does a person like you hang out?
Yeah!
okay. Artifact City.
no. Classic collectibles.
potentially dangerous.
you go talk to the owner. I'm gonna do some research.
welcome to the Hairy Tarantula. How can I-- hey, I know you.
agent Bering.
what can I do you for?
earlier today you were praising vigilantes.
are you aware that someone in town is dressing up s a superhero and taking the law into their own hands?
finally, someone's nutting up, showing the cops how it's done.
Yeah, well, people are getting hurt.
Yeah, who? Scum of the earth?
who's this guy dressed up as, so I can order more of that?
do you keep records of your customers' purchases?
Yeah. I got a pull list. Why?
I'm gonna need the names of anyone who's ever bought Iron Shadow merchandise.
I like a woman who gives orders.
just get me the list.
so is Brutus Beefcake our man?
he wishes. Did you find anything?
I sure did.
issue 112.
the government orders all superheroes "to reveal their secret identities, "but the Iron Shadow removes his mask for no man.
so the Feds send out--" I meant, um... with our case.
no.
so what's with the whole underwear on the outside thing?
they're called trunks.
okay. I just never pegged you for such a--what are they called?
fanboys?
Yeah, well, my sister got me hooked on comics after my dad died.
she thought it'd be a good escape for me.
I've got every issue of The Legendary Iron Shadow except for number 46-- it's my white whale.
of course, if my stuff never comes, I'll have to rebuild my collection from scratch.
it'll come.
there're only two types of criminals-- parasites and cowards.
best mantra ever.
Pete, I heard that today in the coffee shop.
what?
trade you for your phone number.
okay. Here.
Sheldon said he lost his clothes, his computer, and his collection.
good work, chum. To the Batmobile.
it's just a rental.
no, no, no. You're not the one doing this.
not doing what, Arthur?
Artie. Not doing what?
nothing. Nothing did anything.
Artie, if there's something wrong with the Warehouse, you should tell us.
all right, enough. Enough.
Macpherson. I saw him.
where?
the first time?
by the Escher Vault.
shut up.
so first, he blows up the Warehouse, then he dies in it, now he's haunting it?
dude, go into the light already.
no, no, ghosts don't exist. They're just a manifestation of a temporal-- but the dead can rise again.
God, that vampire meme is so aught-nine.
Artie, are you sure this isn't just a manifestation of your own guilt?
no, no, no. I have no guilt. I tried to save his life. He didn't want to be saved.
no, no, no, this... This is something else.
the accumulation of energy within the Warehouse combined with-- see if we have this
combined with MacPherson's psychic residue may have triggered an artifact in the vicinity of the Escher Vault that projected an apparition.
Rasputin's prayer PE?
would you do the honors? - Yeah.
you think I'm the Iron Shadow?
I work in a coffee shop.
by day, maybe, but by night, you're using a power that's beyond your comprehension.
and maybe even beyond your control.
look, I get it, man.
okay?
it makes you feel powerful, like you've just gone from a 98-pound weakling to a badass overnight.
but every artifact has a downside, and people will get hurt.
yeah... The bad guys.
or somebody that you care about... Like Loretta.
you stay away from her!
she doesn't know anything about this.
they attacked me... In my own home.
you have no idea what that is like.
actually, we kind of do.
Sheldon, please... Just give us the artifact.
okay. I guess I knew it was a bad idea.
I'll just, uh, get it.
it's in there.
what the hell? - Sheldon!
God, don't superheroes ever use stairs?
Ooh, spidey sense tingling.
uh, Pete, just how powerful is this Iron Shadow?
you mean like in a fight with The Hulk, who would win?
okay, sure.
well, the Hulk by a mile. Why?
um, yeah.
I will save this city!
I will make it safe for her.
and no one is going to stop me!
Oh, God.
this is your one warning!
get out of my city!
this isn't a comic book, Pete.
I mean, did you see his hand tremors?
neurological damage.
could be a side effect of molecular alteration.
okay, so Sheldon's bulletproof one minute and then able to leap tall buildings in a single bound the next because...
because he's altering his density.
with what?
so this is some kind of super gooer?
this scrubber mollifies psychically triggered artifacts by really getting down into those pesky, hard-to-reach pores.
so that's how Rasputin survived all those assassination attempts.
survived? No, no, no. Nah, they got him the very first try.
no, the Romanovs needed their enemies, the Bolsheviks, for example, to believe that the mad monk cheated death over and over again.
so what they did was they resurrected Rasputin by using this prayer rope.
it did not get rid of the Bolsheviks, so the birth of Communism
I hate this course. - Sorry.
so anyway, a good scrubbing should get rid of MacPherson.
okay. Okay.
this house... Is clean.
ladies... as you were.
okay.
of all the people you could have turned into, you picked me.
I don't know-- I-I guess you were under some kind of weird spell or something, but I can't help feeling betrayed, because I almost lost the only real family I've ever had, because you decided to pick me.
I didn't pick you.
can't you see what MacPherson has done?
he's turned us all against each other.
Artie? Artie's paranoid, and you're suspicious.
without trust, we're all vulnerable.
and by the way, you're not the only one who almost lost her family.
Hey, Claud, I want to run a theory by you-- you busy?
no. No. No, I'm good to go.
you can't be rid of me that easily, Arthur.
I will not let you win!
gold star on the density altering.
I ran it by Grumpzilla.
he pointed me to three items.
Samson's jawbone, Babe Ruth's bat, and Bruce Lee's punching bag.
but they're all here in the Warehouse.
what about belts? A-are there any belts?
what?
belts? Why belts?
well, the Iron Shadow's belt is made of an indestructible metal that harnesses his chakra energy.
Ding, ding, ding! There is, in fact, a belt that alters density and gives the wearer super strength.
well, do we have it?
alas, Jacob Kurtzberg's belt is not currently in stock.
jacob who? - Kurtzberg. Aka, Jack "The King" Kirby.
he created-- comic book stuff. Okay. Got it.
so if Kirby's belt is the artifact, how do we counter it?
Artie had me categorizing some old DARPA gak a couple weeks ago.
those guys were all about super-sizing soldiers during the cold war.
I'll dig in and holla back.
okay, so Sheldon is unstable and dangerous, plus he already considers us a threat.
which means we're gonna have to play it by my book and not yours, so...
if I were Lex Luthor...
I would go after the Man of Steel's greatest weakness, which is...
kryptonite.
no.
Sheldon, what are you doing here? Are you okay?
do you feel safer now?
you look terrible. Here, sit down. Let me get you something.
you didn't answer my question.
I-I don't understand.
all I want is for you to feel safe.
I always feel safe with you.
Really? You do?
Yes.
I have to tell you something. - No, you don't.
I already know.
I can see it... in your eyes.
I never could have hoped for someone like you, Loretta.
not who I was before, but now... Now things are different.
what do you mean? Different how?
it's for you, Loretta.
I'm doing this for you.
I'm the Iron Shadow.
Oh, my God.
okay, shadow-man, hand it over.- You two again.
we're here to help you.
I don't need your help.
don't you see the power I have?
dude, you have no idea what you're messing with!
no, you don't!
Oh, here we go again!
what's happening?
Sheldon, you have to stop that!
I can't!
are you all right?
no, Loretta, look out!
No!
I have to get out of here.
Pete. Is she okay?
Yeah, yeah. She'll-- she'll be fine. She just, uh... She just lost it there for a second.
Sheldon. Where-- where's Sheldon?
I don't know.
we need to shut him down, asap.
please.
this isn't his fault.
he's only doing this-- for you.
he's in love with you.
talk to me.
good news! I've got just the gizmo to counter the Iron Shadow's powers.
Yeah, well, the bad news is you're in South Dakota.
have no fear... Claudia's here.
nice.
cozy.
don't fret. Artie said it was okay.
well, what he actually said was... Go, go!
Plus, any excuse to get away from Leena.
so what do you got?
this. Absorbs all forms of kinetic energy.
a soldier takes 100 rounds to the chest per second and doesn't break stride.
thinner than Kevlar, way more resilient.
and these puppies... - What?
a Claudia Donovan original.
they channel the absorbed energy from the suit and allow the wearer to redirect it.
I am gonna get to play a superhero in real life!
awesome!
but there's a kink.
the suit's energy-siphoning abilities drain the wearer of all vital fluids, causing paralysis in 60 minutes.
Oh, I'm only gonna need 60 seconds, 'cause I'm gonna be all like biff, bam, pow!
and in men, it causes impotence.
here you go, Wonder Woman.
he won't leave me alone.
why can't I make him leave me alone?
it's not guilt. It's not artifacts.
I really have no idea what the hell it is.
maybe you two aren't finished with each other.
Oh, please, I was finished with James MacPherson 15 years ago.
you parted ways, but you weren't finished.
Artie, he was more than your ex-partner.
he was your friend you shared a connection stronger than most people share in their whole life.
death-- we shared a death.
I think that's what it is. We shared a death.
and we both rose from the ashes, and... We were both brought back-- that's what it is.
we were both brought back. You think? - I think. That's right.
we were both brought back.
we shared a death, and that's what we have in common.
if we don't get that belt, those powers Sheldon has could kill him.
and not just him.
with those gravitational waves he's pulling in, he could pancake an entire city block.
that way.
the factory. - What?
What's-- what's the factory?
before Sheldon was laid off, he was an automotive engineer.
he just goes there to think.
is this how you want it?
all alone in your Fortress of Solitude?
we can help you.
help?
you already made me hurt Loretta!
I had everything under control until you showed up.
this guy's off the charts!
I know. We need to call out the big gun. Come on!
what are you doing?
you're not the Iron Shadow!
and we're not some sinister government agents trying to stop you, okay?
we're the good guys!
and we're trying to help you, whether you want us to or not.
no, I don't want to hurt anyone else.
then take my hands.
Pete, come get the belt!
I got it!
Myka! Use the gauntlets!
thank God you're okay. I'm so sorry.
it's okay. It's over.
they got the belt.
belt?
what are you talking about?
all right, that's troubling.
if it's not the belt, what is it?
help!
it's starting again. I can't get them off!
holy underwear. It's the trunks!
Loretta, you have to get out of here. I can't control this anymore.
I won't leave you.
Loretta, come on! - Sheldon!
we have to go!
what's happening?
his mass keeps increasing!
he's approaching infinite density.
well, that sucks for him.
not just him, man!
if Sheldon collapses in on himself, he's gonna take the whole city with him!
collapses in on himself... Like a--like a black hole?
how do we stop that?
you gotta siphon as much of that gravitational energy as possible...
and then get those trunks off him!
just be careful-- your suit might not be able to absorb another round of energy.
we'll just wait for you here.
Oh, thank you!
okay...
Claudia, what's happening?
the suit has absorbed his power.
we gotta break the circuit!
we got to get those trunks off of him!
are you okay?
super.
is everyone...?
my hero.
I bought a bunch of stuff at a yard sale to replace what I'd lost.
the trunks were mixed in with gym clothes.
till I put them on, I... Had no idea they had such great power.
well, with great power comes great responsibility.
what, is that, like, a thing or something?
what?
maybe, uh...
maybe some identities are best kept secret.
wait, hold up. We're just gonna let him go?
an artifact took control of him, and he hurt somebody that he loves.
I mean, these things happen.
I think we can forgive that, don't you?
Yeah. Yeah. I guess. Yeah.
and once again... The city is safe!
why is that so funny?
that's what-- that's what they say.
this used be our house, James.
I never wanted you gone.
I want you back.
I miss my partner.
and now, because of this... We're connected forever.
maybe you knew that would happen. Maybe that's why you put it in my pocket. Hmm?
Hello, Arthur.
if you're reading this, it's probable that I'm gone.
do you remember this watch?
we used to argue over it.
I think you should have it.
good luck, old friend.
I imagine you're going to need it.
I suppose we could chat from time to time... if that's even possible or not.
Hey, Leena.
it could have easily been me.
MacPherson could have stuck the pearl of wisdom in my ear and turned me into his little stooge.
Yes, he could have.
he was a... Big, fat jerk who sucked.
thank you, Claudia.
Hey, did Myka mention the, uh...?
Yeah. I'm just gonna shelf this, and I'll meet you over at the B&B.
rock on.
Mrs. Frederic... Yo told me to let you know if I...
I experienced anything strange.
Oh, come on!
just admit it was awesome!
you know it was.
okay, okay. I liked being a superhero, okay?
I mean, I got to kick ass and save countless lives.
don't we kind of do that here anyway?
I suppose we do... Odetta.
uh, Oona.
no, Oksana. - It's Ophelia!
okay?
like from Hamlet, yes, Ophelia.
let the mocking commence.
that's-- that's kind of... beautiful.
can "Ophelia" boobies?
snap!
okay, so-- so you-- still no word from-- about your stuff, right?
not a one, my Ophelia.
Nay... Not a one.
well, come, lowly roustabout.
Yes, my darling, and all that. - Yes.
okay, keep going. Keep going.
okay, stop. One, two, three.
Ta-da! Surprise!
you guys!
it wasn't us. - It was all Myka.
she totally masterminded it.
Oh, you know, it's just a distraction until your stuff arrives.
but just in case it doesn't, then you can start to rebuild your collection with this.
issue 46?
what, in mint condition? Do you know how rare this is?
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.
you have no idea what I had to do to get my hands on that.
this calls for cookies. - Oatmeal cookies? Please? Please?
uh... I have to apologize.
I've been extremely distracted, and I'm back now.
I'm back 100%.
100%, huh?
Yeah. 120%, all right? Give me that.
saving your life.
okay, I'd be distracted too if a ghost was chasing me.
no, no. How many times do I have to articulate this?
ghosts do not exist.
what fools attribute to the phenomenon of ghosts actually-- oh, my God, make it stop!
not yet. I'm someone who's trying to enlighten you.
so do you think this feels more like home now?
Nah.
it's better.
surrender the artifact!
Hey, Mykes.
is she okay?
collapses in on himself...
what
you busy?
Oh. Sorry.
I'll be right there.
I don't know
What--whatever!
that alters density
no.
do svidanya.
Samson's jawbone,
welcome to my world.
I never could have hoped
Hello?
because...
if we don't get that belt,
what?
as possible...
ghosts do not exist.
talk to me.
what about belts?
the bad guys.
we were both brought back.
okay.
Wow!
wow?
Nah.
where that call came from.
okay.
Loretta.
okay...
thank you so much.
kryptonite.
beautiful.
let me get you something.
you didn't answer my question.
comic book stuff. Okay. Got it.
I-I guess you were under some kind of
weird spell or something,
hmm?
whoa.
he's only doing this
and once again...
James?
Lois Lane.
Sheldon...
he was a...
100%, huh?
as you were.
that way.
Mrs. Frederic, it was me.
help?
Oh, God.
Yes.
Yeah!
No!
with what?
Myka!
well, do we have it?
I can't get them off!
which is...
Sheldon...
or not.
I don't need your help.
rock on.
15 years ago.
Ophelia?
olive?
Pete, that was not a superhero.
Hey.
Sheldon!
good luck, old friend.
it's better.
Pete, he said pie.
Sheldon!
what are you doing?
awesome!
what?
Hello, Arthur.
I got it!
super.
the factory.
Loretta!
ladies...
maybe, uh...
belts? Why belts?
Loretta, you have to get out of here.
Oh...
but I'll definitely keep my eye out.
Yeah.
neurological damage.
what's happening?
saving your life.
Pete!
in your eyes.
thank you, Claudia.
yeah...
and they hoard the things that can save the world.
Loretta Coffee Shop
okay, then.
is dressing up as a superhero
it'll come.
this house...
Hey, Leena.
is clean.
my hero.
in their whole life.
Yes.
I already know.
Oh, my God.
showing the cops how it's done.
with what? - If I knew that,
w-we think the artifact
is everyone...?
what are you talking about?
and by the way,
Mrs. Frederic...
Nay...
and not just him.
sorry, slick. That's it.
no, no, no, this...
Oh, thank you!
so anyway, a good scrubbing
how do we stop that?
they attacked me...
like Loretta.
babe Ruth's bat,
no, the Romanovs needed their enemies,
check these out.
we have to go!
we gotta break the circuit!
not a one.
those guys were all about super-sizing
soldiers during the cold war.
Loretta, come on! - Sheldon!
it does a bunch of different stuff?
you know, tippy-typy
what's going on? - I'm sorry, it's nothing.
and taking the law into their own hands?
no, no, ghosts don't exist.
and he's in a twisted streetlight.
jacob who? - Kurtzberg.
oy gevalt!
and then able to leap tall buildings
in a single bound the next
that's not a good sign.
put a hole through a brick wall.
he works with the watch.
Oh, you know what? I'm more of a...
to reveal their secret identities, - The Iron Shadow? - Yeah.
death-- we shared a death.
I can see it...
I have to apologize.
okay, stop.
is made of an indestructible metal
I bet you dollars to doughnuts
it makes you feel powerful,
and I'll meet you over at the B&B.
Artie had me categorizing
they sit there, Arthur,
even for you.
sorry. -Thank you for your time.
how do we counter it?
have no fear...
maybe you knew that would happen.
not just him, man!
anything strange or unusual.
the rest of the new motion detectors?
skedaddle.
pick an issue, any issue.
shut up.
I work in a coffee shop.
it's for you, Loretta.
Yeah!
I have to get out of here.
Sheldon. Where
it's not guilt. It's not artifacts.
he was your friend.
Pete. - Hey.
but there's a kink.
why is that so funny?
what?
doubtful.
what report?
how can I-- hey, I know you.
no, no, no. I have no guilt.
I tried to save his life. He didn't want to be saved.
to replace what I'd lost.
we're the good guys!
I'll dig in and holla back.
I miss my partner.
you think? I think.
all right, that's troubling.
you've had your chance, Arthur.
hello.
your natural state of being, isn't it?
at all three locations.
no need, you're looking
see, now I want doughnuts.
you're Joe Shmoe.
but the dead can rise again.
we meet again. - Okay, okay.
the suit has absorbed his power.
the city is safe!
if that's even possi
and gives the wearer super strength.
Yeah. I'm just gonna shelf this, to immovable object.
Claudia, what's happening?
Yeah. Yeah, actually, I do.
you want me to rally the troops?
you know, something that could...
Nah, they got him the very first try.
then he dies in it, now he's haunting it?
okay, so--so you
a soldier takes 100 rounds until your stuff arrives.
no, no. How many times do I have to articulate this?
we're lucky we still have guns.
we can help you.
but they're all here in the Warehouse.
to get my hands on that.
but every artifact has a downside,
you stay away from her!
I ran it by grumpzilla.
they will succumb.
looks like we got a ping.
until you showed up.
well, that sucks for him.
it's okay. It's over.
because he's altering his density.
survived? No, no, no.
Oh, I'm only gonna need 60 seconds,
I mean, these things happen.
thank you.
uh...
so many chances!
no bullet holes.
like that.
officer Kessman...
help me! Please!
he's just a regular guy
like the comic book?
okay, keep going. Keep going.
and Bruce Lee's punching bag.
is this how you want it?
it could have easily been me.
we're connected forever.
we were both brought back-- that's what it is.
he just goes there to think.
and not yours, so...
I'm the Iron Shadow.
and now, because of this...
freeze, Dirty Harry!
the suit's energy-siphoning abilities "We used to argue over it.
they will succumb to my charms, Myka.
uh, yes.
my fuzzy slippers.
parasites and cowards.
well, what if whatever it is, the invulnerability theory, all right?
Hey.
of course, if my stuff never comes,
and then this drug dealer
it's not her fault.
issue 112.
that's right. We were both brought back.
delivered to Detroit Metro police,
she'll--she'll be fine. She just, uh...
if Sheldon collapses in on himself,
Sheldon, please...
I like a woman who gives orders.
you sure? Because for a second there,
Ah, not today, Loretta.
real books, not cartoons!
Yeah. I got a pull list. Why?
I'm gonna need the names - Wha--wha-- -If you don't mind...
so the only casualty's the perp.
I'm her partner, Agent Lattimer. Howdy.
take these with me.
what do you think he's got?
no, the Iron Shadow doesn't have powers.
means to this community?
nothing.
I'll have to rebuild my collection from scratch.
if I were Lex Luthor...
I think you should have it.
actually, we kind of do.
I-I don't understand.
do you remember this watch?
if it's not the belt, what is it?
he pointed me to three items.
well, the Iron Shadow's belt
not yet. I'm someone who's trying to enlighten you.
aye aye, Captain Bligh.
[Deliver to W-13, property of M. O.B.]
what's the "O" For?
who, H. G. Wells?
she must have found an artifact
we should have Claudia check the Warehouse database.
my collection--everything.
Yeah, who? Scum of the earth?
dude, go into the light already.
Artie, he was more than your ex-partner.
look at that. - He's in a coma.
his mass keeps increasing!
you told me to let you know if I...
we'll just wait for ya here.
causing paralysis in 60 minutes.
that's-- that's kind of...
no, I don't want to hurt anyone else.
Hello, Motor City.
between you and Claudia,
thank you. Bye.
by the Escher Vault.
welcome to our world.
rodent problem.
Yes, he could have.
and we're trying to help you,
till I put them on, I...
I imagine you're going to need it.
everything's Jake on the home front first.
with those gravitational waves he's pulling in,
this isn't a comic book, Pete.
what do you mean? Different how?
Artie!
Mmm.
Hey, up there-- the window's been broken.
with our case. - Oh.
they're called trunks. - Okay.
nothing did anything.
for someone like you, Loretta.
home.
bullets. - Yesiree, Bob.
we should probably... - I think we should.
okay, okay. So--so...
finally, someone's nutting up,
I sure did.
you have no idea what I had to do
you look terrible. Here, sit down.
then take my hands.
she just lost it there for a second.
I'm doing this for you.
Pete, come get the belt!
Oh, you know, it's just a distraction
Detroit, MICHIGAN
snap!
I've been extremely distracted,
an artifact took control of him,
gold star on the density altering.
Finally!
getting to it. - Getting to it?
but not what caused - No, madam.
to know that you're pissed off at me.
I know. I just want to make sure
Amen, brother.
so first, he blows up the Warehouse,
Hey, did Myka mention the, uh...?
what I want is for you
Yeah.
three squashed bullets, okay?
so this is some kind of super gooer?
because you decided to pick me.
I will not let you win!
the authorities need our help?
maybe you two aren't finished with each other.
and turned me into his little stooge.
you picked me.
now things are different.
here you go, wonder woman.
what? What's-- what's the factory?
in my own home.
I guess. - Yeah.
maybe that's why you put it in my pocket.
Oh, here we go again!
actually-- - Oh, my God, make it stop!
wait, hey, hey, B, B!
Hello, square one...
it's just a rental.
I didn't pick you.
that makes her act like a girl.
Kevlar? - No way a vest
you're a big kid now. All right? I got to go.
that was a superhero.
trained to be the ultimate urban Samurai.
what did you use to mop the floor with these guys?
like you've just gone from a 98-pound weakling and allow the wearer to redirect it.
Claudia's here. - Nice.
you seemed untethered.
Claudia.
you know, Dudley Do-Right was first on the scene - Would you do the honors? - Yeah.
it only took six months.
I wouldn't be sending you both to Detroit.
my chest is burdenless.
look, all's I'm saying is
right, Sheldon?
Yeah, comic books!
Artie.
you should tell us. - All right, enough. Enough.
to absorb another round of energy.
or somebody that you care about...
thinner than Kevlar, way more resilient.
well, what he actually said was...
it's just bull!
it's just that I have a little...
Yeah. He's also P. O.'d about the cutbacks,
there...
we're very sorry.
and use my powers to fight crime.
Sheldon, it's okay. - No, it's not.
okay. Artifact City.
Artie wants us to finish putting these sensors up.
but I can't help feeling betrayed,
don't you see the power I have?
don't fret. Artie said it was okay.
those powers Sheldon has could kill him.
what the hell? - Sheldon!
of all the people you could have turned into,
and that's when I look up, and I see the hole.
twizzlers gal myself, but thanks.
okay, even ultimate urban Samurai
good work, chum. To the Batmobile.
go, go!
do you know how rare this is?
good news! I've got just the gizmo he's gonna take the whole city with him!
drain the wearer of all vital fluids,
we need to shut him down, asap.
and people will get hurt.
so that's how Rasputin survived
all those assassination attempts.
I think that's what it is. We shared a death.
this calls for cookies. - Oatmeal scotchies?
and we're not some sinister government agents
just be careful-- your suit might not be able
all right, first this mugger is
that's why ethics are codified in the
look, cranky's kind of
I'm gonna go check out the bedroom.
you go after good citizens like Loretta?
nothing.
Boo-frakkin'-hoo.
the government orders all superheroes
Artie, are you sure this isn't
and what the hell is that thing?
it did not get rid of the Bolsheviks,
Ding, ding, ding! There is, in fact, a belt
and these puppies...
I guess I knew it was a bad idea.
can Can I feel your boobies Boobies?
don't we kind of do that here anyway?
please? Please? Uh...
a person did this?
three shots fired...
is the President in town?
no, no, we're just here on a local matter,
knock yourselves out.
Yeah, well, people are getting hurt.
this is something else.
it opens things.
that harnesses his chakra energy.
a Claudia Donovan original.
I experienced anything strange.
one, two, three.
should get rid of MacPherson.
so what are you guys looking for?
she thought it'd be a good escape for me.
killing... Does no one a favor.
this is Agent Bering, Secret Service.
best in the Midwest.
bastards took my clothes, my computer, - Wait, the Iron Shadow? - Yeah.
and give him the mother of all atomic wedgies
so is Brutus Beefcake our man?
"so the Feds send out--" - I meant, um...
fanboys? - Yeah, well, my sister
we interrupt this concert...
this used be our house, James.
to a badass overnight.
what fools attribute to the phenomenon of ghosts
he's approaching infinite density.
and then get those trunks off him!
why can't I make him leave me alone?
you have no idea what that is like.
you mean like in a fight with The Hulk, who would win?
may have triggered an artifact - Arthur? - Artie?
our mysterious assailant strikes again.
look, Pete, could you just figure it out?
detroit's almost finest.
to counter the Iron Shadow's powers.
we got to get those trunks off of him!
thank God you're okay. I'm so sorry.
like from Hamlet, yes, Ophelia.
plus he already considers us a threat.
not a one, my Ophelia.
they got the belt. - Belt?
Where's Sheldon? - I don't know.
thank you for remembering our appointment.
plane's in an hour.
that projected an apparition.
had no idea they had such great power.
what, please?
which means we're gonna have to play it by my book
that's what-- that's what they say.
Plus, any excuse to get away from Leena.
we need to call out the big gun. Come on!
I don't have to read your aura
Yeah, no, that wouldn't explain the hole in the wall.
Oh, uh, I'm gonna...
Macpherson.
they're just a manifestation of a temporal
I mean, did you see his hand tremors?
sister friend kind of did us a favor by killing
Yes, Madam. I was out walking my beat, and she makes the best pies in the Midwest.
okay, just put him down nice and slow.
what?
I saw him. - MacPherson?
by day, maybe, but by night,
at least they used to be. Investigators didn't find these?
the Bolsheviks, for example,
neighborhood watch meets here once a week.
this guy's off the charts! - I know.
Sheldon, you have to stop that!
all right.
how could you possibly have survived?
hello.
I had everything under control
what about my stuff?
okay, look.
and I'm saying there are other ways
and he likes to do things his own way.
just a manifestation of your own guilt?
then we are vulnerable.
jeez, Leena. Skulk much?
that's a good theory, Olivia.
it's a key.
his computer, and his collection.
you're not the Iron Shadow!
no blood...
MacPherson could have stuck the pearl of wisdom in my ear
it's my books, my music,
sorry.
but I need you working together and over it.
so, officer Kessman, according to the reports, at a one-man Iron Shadow encyclopedia.
you think I'm the Iron Shadow?
and he hurt somebody that he loves.
you know it was. - Okay, okay.
we got an anonymous tip, and I come run...
to the chest per second and doesn't break stride.
shipped in from D. C. this morning.
you two again. - We're here to help you.
Jeez!
okay, look, Artie, this is a little too crotchety,
so if Kirby's belt is the artifact,
and by the time it takes to print these photos,
no freaking way!
you grew up in a bookstore. How do you not know that?
can't leap over buildings, okay?
sorry to bother you. - Sorry.
okay, well, thank you. We'll take it from here.
get out of my city!
are you okay? - Do you feel safer now?
we shared a death, and that's what we have in common.
big, fat jerk who sucked.
I always feel safe with you.
I can't! - Sheldon?
okay, I'd be distracted too if a ghost was chasing me.
might be because Loretta organized the group,
Yeah, best to omit that from your report.
maybe that's where he's getting those powers from.
you find an artifact that gives you superpowers.
welcome to the Hairy Tarantula.
I didn't do this. - Sure you didn't.
doughnuts or pies.
let's just think this through, okay?
who's this guy dressed up as, so I can order more of that?
help! It's starting again.
Sheldon, what are you doing here?
Oh, please, I was finished with James MacPherson
you always hurt the one you love.
going back to work now.
two slices of the lemon meringue for the Agents, please.
James? James!
Aah!
holy underwear. It's the trunks!
no. No. No, I'm good to go.
Hey, Claud, I want to run a theory by you
absorbs all forms of kinetic energy.
I will save this city!
okay. Okay.
Yep, yep, yep.
pretty high up too. He's in a coma as well.
Ah, listen, I know things are awkward
um, I'll have Claudia explore
Rasputin's prayer rope?
harriet Tubman's Thimble-- it was me?
irresistible force-- say Ni-hao some old DARPA gak a couple weeks ago.
Claudia! What's happening?
what, is that, like, a thing or something?
I bought a bunch of stuff at a yard sale
wait, hold up. We're just gonna let him go?
you got our stuff or what?
guess the Iron Shadow doesn't use keys.
just give us the artifact.
Really? You do?
Artie? - He won't leave me alone.
Myka, Myka. Are you okay?
since when does the Secret Service investigate petty crimes?
just open the safe.
no, you don't!
are you all right? - No, Loretta, look out!
Detroit, MICHIGAN - So what do you got? - This.
this is your one warning!
saved by the beep.
Hi. Hello!
what, are you taking deliveries from the mob?
so not telling you. - Whatever.
no, what I...
I trade you for your phone number.
Allons-y!
kiss, kiss to you, Brenda.
large mochaccino and a slice of Pumpkin to go?
are you aware that someone in town got me hooked on comics after my dad died.
and we could use the neighborhood watch's help.
I think we can forgive that, don't you?
God, don't superheroes ever use stairs?
the Phoenix?
Whoa...Cozy.
the trunks were mixed in with gym clothes.
only the most "Awesomest" Character of the silver age.
a guy in tights just leaped over a building.
well, I'm doing this instead.
maybe he's doing things his own way with an artifact.
Yeah, yeah, there's some guy running around town.
do you have any idea what this woman
now, that is a big hole.
Yeah. Yeah.
investigators? With all the recent cutbacks,
okay, shadow-man, hand it over.
I suppose we do... Odetta.
he could pancake an entire city block.
you're never gonna win these people over.
I'll be right back, but you can talk to Sheldon.
not doing what? - Nothing.
can't you tell by reading my aura?
artifact? What are you talking about?
I mean, I got to kick ass and save countless lives.
a-are there any belts? - What?
uh, Oona. No, Oksana.
come on! - Call me.
with this.
the worst case of identity theft ever.
can't you see what MacPherson has done?
Claudia, if the Warehouse is vulnerable, "There's only two types of criminals'
if you don't mind...
the accumulation of energy within the Warehouse
please. This isn't his fault.
maybe some identities are best kept secret.
you guys! - It wasn't us.
you shared a connection stronger than most people share
you already made me hurt Loretta!
you know? It makes me feel like I'm, uh...
what do you do? - I track down Ralph Brunsky
do you keep records of your customers' purchases?
Aah! Aah!
it was all Myka. - She totally masterminded it.
he's turned us all against each other.
I have to tell you something. - No, you don't.
okay, so Sheldon is unstable and dangerous,
I suppose we could chat from time to time...
joy. Is it Tuesday again already?
except for number 46-- it's my white whale.
okay, so Sheldon's bulletproof one minute
I would go after the Man of Steel's greatest weakness,
my city needs me.
combined with MacPherson's psychic residue
whoever that was has an artifact.
Mm-hmm. - No.
I've got every issue of The Legendary Iron Shadow
he wishes. Did you find anything?
dude, you have no idea what you're messing with!
so the birth of Communism-- - I hate this course.
surprise!
Ooh, spidey sense tingling.
Hey, you okay? -Yeah. I'm fine.
happy? These things hold special memories for me.
game on.
Hi. That's a great color on you, Ma'am.
aka, Jack "The King" Kirby. He created
not who I was before, but now...
she doesn't know anything about this.
Yes, my darling, and all that. - Yes.
they channel the absorbed energy from the suit
do you want to just get it off your chest right now?
to keep this neighborhood safe than vigilantism.
would flatten a slug that much-- that's just freaky.
I can't control this anymore. - I won't leave you.
you gotta siphon as much of that gravitational energy "If you're reading this, it's probable that I'm gone.
like a--like a black hole? - Uh-huh.
because I'm gonna be all like biff, bam, pow!
he is found dangling from this flagpole
gracias.
Yeah. 120%, all right? Give me that.
still no word from-- about your stuff, right?
and I'm back now. I'm back 100%.
you see anything like that that fits the bill?
no, that was the Iron Shadow.
I just never pegged you for such a--what are they called?
you parted ways, but you weren't finished.
Oh, come on! Just admit it was awesome!
I'm sorry, Arthur.
trying to stop you, okay?
uh, no. Sorry. Haven't seen anything.
has some kind of a bulletproof invulnerability.
you can't be rid of me that easily, Arthur.
issue 46? What, in mint condition?
okay. Well, maybe Claudia can do a little,
we all feel unsafe.
so what's with the whole underwear on the outside thing?
Pete, I heard that today in the coffee shop.
um, yeah.
to believe that the mad monk
cheated death over and over again.
by using this prayer rope.
I'm watching a movie, and I don't have the Tivo.
Aah!
fortunately, the occupants are out of town,
okay. Here. Sheldon said he lost his clothes,
Myka! Use the gauntlets!
could be a side effect of molecular alteration.
Hey, Claudia!
combined with-- see if we have this
parasites and cowards.
all I want is for you to feel safe.
all alone in your Fortress of Solitude?
let the mocking commence.
you were the first on scene at all three incidents?
twist a street lamp or...
or I don the guise of my all-time favorite superhero
and there are other threats out there.
I'll just, uh, get it. It's in there.
Yeah. Well, I have to run to the bank.
but just in case it doesn't, - No. Classic collectibles. - Potentially dangerous.
agent Bering. - Hi. What can I do you for?
okay, sure. - Well, The Hulk by a mile. Why?
I liked being a superhero, okay?
so do you think this feels more like home now?
that was no man.
okay, that mask he was wearing looked kind of artifacty.
now, that's something I never expected to see.
by really getting down into those pesky,
hard-to-reach pores.
just get me the list.
I will make it safe for her.
weren't you supposed to be helping, uh, Leena install
Yeah, well, the bad news is you're in South Dakota.
whether you want us to or not.
I am gonna get to play a superhero in real life!
in front of the entire seventh-grade class.
Olga. Oprah.
what does this do?
earlier today you were praising vigilantes.
I really have no idea what the hell it is.
so what they did was they resurrected Rasputin "but the Iron Shadow removes his mask for no man.
where? - The first time?
for you. He's in love with you.
so officer Kessman said he got an anonymous tip, right?
not doing what, Arthur?
and in men, it causes impotence.
and I hear three shots fired, followed by a loud crash.
of anyone who's ever bought Iron Shadow merchandise.
in the vicinity of the Escher Vault
I've read that there are two types of criminals
Ugh! God, that vampire meme is so aught-nine.
to help Leena install the rest of the new motion detectors.
Artie, if there's something wrong with the Warehouse,
without trust, we're all vulnerable.
you're not the only one who almost lost her family.
I think we already know your issues, okay?
that's why we have Teslas, not bullets.
Yeah. Let me get you some salt.
who was that masked man?
it's Ophelia! Okay?
hmm, her aura... - It's just so...
to bring you your regularly scheduled job.
Aah!
and maybe even beyond your control.
because I almost lost the only real family I've ever had,
you, uh--you may want to cover your eyes.
before Sheldon was laid off, he was an automotive engineer.
well, with great power comes great responsibility.
I never wanted you gone. I want you back.
Aah!
no, no, no. You're not the one doing this.
and we are not going to be vulnerable ever again.
you go talk to the owner. I'm gonna do some research.
olive oil? Olive Garden?
you want to make an omelet, you got to crack a few skulls.
you're using a power that's beyond your comprehension.
uh, Pete, just how powerful is this Iron Shadow?
and no one is going to stop me!
then you can start to rebuild your collection
Artie? Artie's paranoid, and you're suspicious.
M-O-B, Einstein. Myka O. Bering?
I was robbed at gunpoint in my apartment.
we just want somebody to do something about it.
look, I get it, man. Okay?
well, come, lowly roustabout.
where does a person like you hang out?
alas, Jacob Kurtzberg's belt is not currently in stock.
but, uh, I'll take her... her slice.
don't talk to me. Talk-- - Just get it done.
and we both rose from the ashes, and...
best mantra ever.
I don't know. Wyatt Earp's badge, maybe?
this scrubber mollifies psychically triggered artifacts
quickly, we don't have much time.
besides that, the De-bronze functions activated twice.
who's our mystery guest?
where were you exactly?
I was at the Warehouse. - You don't remember.
you've been having lapses.
how do you know that?
the pearl of wisdom.
MacPherson must have planted it in your inner ear weeks ago.
if a person uses it properly, they can control your thoughts and movements.
shipped in from D. C.
what about my stuff?
sorry, slick. If you don't mind, I'm watching a movie, and I don't have Tivo.
no way.
does this mean I'm an Agent now?
no, it means I can reach you any time of day or night.
okay. Not as good.
these are the reason.
Hello, Irene.
Mr. Valda, nice to see you again.
if MacPherson is out there
he's out there, and he's planning something far worse than any of you can imagine.
I know what the plan is. I'll tell you everything.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
Mrs. Frederic, you told me to let you know if I--I experienced anything strange.
Wichita ARMY PROVING GROUNDS 1944
secret Service. Find General Williams.
tell him Buck Mendell from Warehouse 13 is here.
I have full authority to shut down the Farnsworth demonstration now.
Farnswoth
thank you for coming.
why are these out?
Claudia pulled them to learn more about her new toy.
she just wanted to spruce up her her far
right.
um, I'll lock them back up as soon as you leave.
you were vague on the phone.
tell me what you're feeling.
edgy.
unfocused.
and the headaches?
it's all right.
Mr. Valda knows you've been through an ordeal.
why am I having these headaches?
when MacPherson was part of your consciousness, he may have left something behind.
an echo.
this is Taka.
she's here to help us find out.
I mean, I have, like, over 5, 000 cds.
you don't have 5, 000 cds. - I do!
good morning.
Here--ooh, I'm sorry. Can I help you there?
there you go.
no, no, no. You're welcome.
that's-- have a nice day.
Yep, they still hate us.
Why?
maybe it's your cologne. - Well, I'm not wearing any.
that's so funny. You're hilarious.
look, making connections with strangers is never easy.
just relax. It'll happen.
hit the brakes, slick.
the Post Office is closed.
closed? - Yes.
it's 10: 00 in the morning.
government cutbacks. Everything was sold off or shipped out.
wait, wait, wait. What about my stuff?
I was supposed to come pick up my stuff this morning.
try the branch in Featherhead.- Well, Featherhead is 90 miles away.
take a bus. Read a book.
now wait--wait-- wait a minute, lady.
look, I'm in forced retirement.
going to make popcorn and watch movies on cable,'cause that's all I can afford to do on my government pension.
what's left of it, anyways.
Thanks.
What?"Thanks"? Thanks for what?
why do you people all hate us?
okay. Relax, okay?
just call the branch in Featherhead.
okay, Farnsworth, let's pimp you out.
Claudia, where are the schematics to the bronze section?
got Farnsworth gak?
what the hell are you doing?
you gave it to me. - You're tampering with perfection.
those are Warehouse issue. - These things need color, GPS, texting, and email is what they need.
need? They don't need!
they have their own secure frequency spectrum.
they can't be cracked, hacked, tapped or-- well, can I at least give it a better ringtone?
Oh, just give it a better ringtone?
Yeah. - No!
you know what you can give it? You can give it back.
no, no, no, no, no.
well then, button it up and learn to live with it.
fine. Living with it.
you see what happens?
Yeah, so if you could call me back, I would appreciate it. Thank you.
Featherhead voicemail?
one for Post Office, two for hunting licenses, three for county maintenance.
so I guess they'll either find my stuff or pump my septic tank.
Oh, great.
now this thing's on the fritz.
okay, let's go for a drive, shall we?
Yeah. I hear the middle of nowhere is beautiful this time of year.
come on, men. Let's kill what needs killin' and go home.
hang on.
we're not gonna die today, you understand me?
other guys are gonna die. A lot of 'em Tojo's boys.
but not us. Not if I can help it.
follow me, boys.
it wasn't me. It wasn't me. It wasn't me.
there's something wrong in town.
why does Artie want us to meet him here?
I don't know. You know, it was a terrible connection, and all I heard was "barber shop" and "emergency.
maybe his eyebrows are finally eating his face.
how on earth did you get a driver's license?
can you drive a stick shift?
no. - Then take a lesson.
Oh, you're a menace! - Well, in a good way.
Artie, my Farnsworth is making weird noises.
you see what you did?
what? You busted my Farnsworth?
No! - Now, who is a menace?
I only messed with mine.
well, that's the bad news.
what? What was that? - That is an alarm system.
if there's an artifact in town, then that would turn purple, and it turned purple.
this town has artifacts?
not normally, no.
but over the centuries, towns that host Warehouses have been given, well, certain kinds of protection, just in case.
and given recent events, an artifact may have been placed here to distract us from more, well, pressing pursuits.
Macpherson. - H. G. 韦尔斯. Part of the plan?
maybe. We'll see. First of all, let's get the artifact.
I want you to question the townies, find out if anything particularly unusual has happened, then snag, bag, and tag.
so you want us to go door to door?
we have a standard cover in Univille.
they think we're IRS agents?
and they think the Warehouse is an IRS storage facility that contains every U. S. tax return ever filed.
no wonder they hate us. We're tax collectors.
I hate us.
Oh, you even have their tax returns.
sure. Like that's a big stretch.
okay, so while we're dodging tomatoes, what are you gonna do?
s. I.S. Salinger inventory scan.
if an artifact is AWOL, the S. I.S. will I. D.It.
Salinger, like the author?
RTFM, dude.
Oh, read the f...manual. I like that.
Mr. Valda, I don't think employing the pearl of wisdom is our wisest move.
you know better than I the consequences that can come from using artifacts.
speed is of the essence.
you're looking for trouble.
I'm looking for clarity.
Irene, if something is buried deep inside Leena's subconscious, if MacPherson has left a residue that could help us understand what we're facing, then we must dig it out.
and we risk a woman's life.
to save many.
Mrs. Frederic, it's all right.
after all that's happened, I want to do this.
Leena. - Thank you.
and if something should go wrong?
Taka will make it right.
Marines. You saw Marines?
Yes, but like from World War II.
probably some guys playing dress-up like civil war nuts.
were they locals?
I've never seen them before. - Did you catch any of their names?
was there anything distinctive on their uniforms?
no. Yes!
a patch.
a wolf's head.
uh, how do you know they were Marines?
my grandfather was a Marine.
N--oh,'cause so was I.
Really? - Yes.
my grandfather... Hmm?
he was an evil bastard who emotionally tortured his children.
okay.
look, what does this have to do with my taxes?
well, um, if they were a profit-based...- If there was any kind of profiting...
...Based group of war re-enactors...- If they're acting about war...
then we would have to bring in some...
you mentioned seeing a flash of light.
this town has power problems. Transformers blow all the time.
sparks and brownouts. Nothing ever gets fixed.
we lost our Post Office.
I mean, how do you guys justify warehousing old tax returns when we're losing essential government services?
I mean, you guys are useless.
Hey, wait-- wait a minute, lady.
now you may not know this, but we're out there every day, trying to save your butt.
maybe today even.
saving my butt? - Yeah, that's right.
I'm still waiting for my bush tax credit.
who's your supervisor? I want a name.
Oh, I'm sorry. Here, let me spell it out for you.
U-n-c-l-e s-a-- Uncle Sam.
he's patriotic and he can spell. Isn't he cute?
well, uh, my apologies.
seriously, Kelly, you have no idea.
it's Dr. Hernandez.
whatever.
uh, thank you for your time.
hello.
customer.
I have a special... Order.
I was just working on a project that needs unworking.
can I get the name?
it's old copper wire.
um, a 20th century blend.
two-inch flange, one traverse.
um, and some old Mallory capacitors.
also, um, some half-watt 180k ohm Bradley resistors.
and you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?
I heard "wire.
uh, let me check the file.
Donovan," you said?
I. R.S.huh?
um, yeah.
I'll just have a look around.
so I just moved here. - Why on earth would you do that?
Yeah. Kind of a long story.
uh, th--that's the owner's apartment.
he doesn't like people to go up there.
he's kind of private.
wow, that's loud. - I know, right? Excuse me.
I can't find anything under that name, but...
uh, is everything okay?
No! The "R" is for "Revenue"!
there's no need for language like that.
strike 11.
all right, so no one else has seen anything.
maybe there's not an artifact.
you know, maybe Kelly the vet is one kitten short of a litter.
okay, William Siminski, lucky number 12, right across the street.
Yeah.
uh, you know what? If Claudia broke this
did you see that?
see that?
and we both see that.
afternoon, Jake.
never thought I'd see you in my town again.
Hey, he looks familiar.
more re-enactors?
this town belongs to me.
that's where you're wrong, Jake.
the only thing belong to you after this day is a coffin.
now that's a good line.
holy crap.
was that for real?
well, it seemed like it a second ago.
were you hit?
no.
but I think my underwear is shot.
guys, I think I might be onto something.
sunspot activity and shifts in the Earth's mag field spanning 80 years, from the Wild West to World War II, might have actually left trace bioelectric
what?
at 10: 30 this morning, you futzed with the Farnsworths.
also at 10: 30, a town vet saw Marines.
and every even since then has started with Farnsworths squawking.
I fixed them. They're fine.
what about MacPherson or 韦尔斯 stealing an artifact and hiding it in town?
dude, what's up with your S. I.S?
we scanned three times, Claudia. Nothing is missing.
well, it's not me.
Artie, there's not enough power between these Farnsworths to twitch a frog's leg.
until you started mucking with intricate circuitry. - Okay, okay, okay.
what if it's not the Farnsworths?
thank you.
just if, and if it's not, then it's still possible that there's an artifact in town that's generating some sort of power that's causing this, or it's drawing from another source.
theoretically.
all right, theoretically if it's not the Farnsworths, then we triangulate from the Marines, from the horses, from the cowboys, and it's somewhere, theoretically, in this area.
that's, like, four square blocks, Artie.
well, four square blocks we can focus on instead of, you know, running all around town.
Artie, can you please run another S. I.S. scan?
I suppose.
okay. And we will go back to "UN"-iville and hit these four square blocks hard.
I thought it was "You"-niville.
UN"-iville. Unincorporated town.
let's just get out of here before this thing escalates.
escalates how? - "Dangerously" comes to mind.
the amber acts as a governor controlling the pearl, which allows Taka to travel with it.
there will be less pain than before, but a little.
let's get it over with.
fascinating.
Yes.
let's see what's in there.
yo, Artie call you?
Yeah, a huge power drain at the hardware store. - So what's the layout?
two-story, one employee. A new guy named Todd.
owner's out of town, and when I went for the stairs, Todd warned me off.
bet whatever's sapping power is up there.
okay, so let's go around back.
you stay here, keep an eye out.
you think these things are still under warranty?
Yeah, I doubt it covers acts of Claudia. Just watch out for another light show.
what the hell?
holy mackerel.
Oh, dude.
dude! Dude!
I'm so sorry.
uh, don't move.
Hey, guys?
guys, there's something-- Okay.
qu'est-ce Que c'est?
Todd's boss is a video pirate.
selling illegal satellite feeds to the good folks of Univille.
this is the artifact?
no, no, this is a felony.
my Farnsworth barked. Something's coming.
I think it's here, downstairs. Something spooked Todd.
what did you do?
that thing you showed me. The--you know, the arm thing, maybe the leg thing.
I don't know. It just happened.
that's a tiger.
Yep. - Forgive me, brother.
and that--that's a gladiator.
not ghosts. Time travel?
Spartacus.
here, boy.
to the Gods, we are beasts that dance to their tune. Not anymore.
I've heard this speech before.
it is better to die a man, fighting for your freedom, than to die a slave, fighting for their pleasure.
Hey, weren't you just a cowboy?
Hey, be careful! Pete!
okay, I think it's real now.
Pete, get out of the way!
get out of here, guys, now!
Pete, no! - Pete!
Pete, no!
what happened?
a gladiator just kicked your ass.
Oh, good. For a second there, I thought a gladiator just kicked my ass.
No!
enough, Mr. Valda. You're chasing shadows.
something is throwing those shadows.
can you go deeper?
there's some risk.
then go carefully.
wait!
Irene. - I must be certain she survives.
Taka is-- Taka is out of her depth. I am not.
Lattimer and Bering, right?
they're so raw, so untrained, so corruptible.
James, are you there?
why is H. G. 韦尔斯 here? What does she want?
Mrs. Frederic, you must tell me your secret.
I can't remember anything.
not much to remember.
you fell of a ladder and banged your head. Dropped your glasses.
you really work for the IRS?
actually, I work for a top secret organization that tracks down mysterious and powerful artifacts.
you're gonna audit me, aren't you?
maybe.
baby.
sadist!
Hey, maybe you can give him something, for, you know, the pain?
aspirin.
I think I saw some rolling around in my glove compartment.
Oh, well, maybe if I was a dog you'd be nice to me.
what is with you two?
man hater.
right.
okay, okay, so the gladiator is the cowboy is the marine.
yeah.- According to the description given by Dr. Bow-Wow.
so maybe we're looking for the medallion of the village people. I don't know.
Hey, you took the transmitter course at Rowley? - Sure.
okay. Do you remember the section on identifying aggressive frequencies?
Ah, here's a surprise. I don't.
okay. We know that these things go off before something happens, right?
so, what? We think they're causing it now?
no, I don't think they're transmitting anything, but
but maybe they're reacting to the signal, picking it up before it becomes a gladiator or whatever.
and maybe Claudia can turn them from reacting devices into locating devices.
Oh, God.
What'd I do now?
I knew we had a Farnsworth aisle.
Yes, which is off-limits to you, so, off--off-limits, which means, do not touch a thing.
you just tell me what you need to rig these two into signal locators, and I will get it.
I. Okay? - Got it.
okay, I need that.
Oh, okay. And that.
this?
and, uh, those. - That's awfully vague, Claudia.
those two right there. - Those. I've got it now. I have it now.
Ooh, and let me get a-- no, no, no, no! Oh, no, Claudia, no.
see, Farnsworth dabbled in nuclear fusion, and some of the things on this side of the aisle, they're still kicking.
still kicking?
you see what you find out when you include the old guy? Huh?
what, are you having a stroke?
you know what? Touch it. Go ahead.
touch it all.
okay.
MacPherson could have buried an artifact and repaved the road.
well, maybe Claudia's tweaked Farnsworths will help.
I hate maps.
I thought men loved maps, you know? So they don't have to ask for directions when they get lost.
well, you don't get to ask directions in basic training.
how long were you a Marine?
you're always a Marine.
but I never wore a patch.
wait. Kelly said they wore a wolf patch, right?
Yeah.
well, Marines don't wear patches.
Oh, man, come on. Come on!
what? Wait!
all righty.
good to go. - Good to go where?
Oh, uh, right. Do you want me to drive you?
God, no. Give me the keys.
Oh, uh, by the way, there's weirdness with item 186 in the Farnsworth aisle.
weirdness? What weirdness?
well, original manifest listed two parts to item 186 snagged in 1944, but there's only one part on the shelf: 186-B.
Jus--just-- where's 186-A?
I mean, if it was missing, then S. I.S. would have pinged.
and what does that half of the artifact do?
manifest doesn't say, but inventory records show 186-A was never shelved.
never?
so it was never here?
it must have been down on the loading dock for 70 years.
do we have a loading dock?
fire. The wolf was spitting fire.
Yeah. You better stay inside for a while, just to be safe.
safe? I mean, what's going on?
look, Kelly-- Dr. Hernandez.
Dr. Hernandez, please, stay inside, lock your door.
Fire-spitting wolf patch?
I mean, explain.
operation Dragon Wolf.
it played in heavy rotation on the 3: 30 movie back in Ohio.
I must have watched it, like, 100 times.
the lead Marine was played by an actor named Raymond St. James.
these are movies?
well, they're Raymond st. James movies.
he also played a few cowboys and a gladiator too.
1944
all right. So, 1944.
you're here somewhere.
project Gemini.
philo, you broadcasting madman.
Transmutationaldelivery device.
project Gemini army field test prototype.
a transmutational camera to a receiving projector.
philo, what happened? - It wasn't, and then it was.
it was what?
real.
a projector camera.
186-A never made it here. It didn't even get here.
so, what? The shipping label tore off?
three-dimensional camera, check.
3-d projector, lost in the mail.
all right, I'm not promising anything.
okay, so what do we hope happens?
well, the screen should display a tapering arrow, okay?
the narrow end should point to the signal's origin.
that's the source of the transmissions.
what about the other end?
that's where trouble's likely to show up.
since the movies are getting more violent and more real, we'll want to avoid that.
Ooh, hot damn.
all right. Well, I guess the source is this way and the problem's that way.
okay.
more violent? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
if the problem's that way, Kelly's is that way.
Kelly, I need you to open the door.
you told me to keep it locked.
I know, but I need you to open it now.
will you make up your mind?
would you please just open the damn door?
God, what is with this chick?
look, I need you to get out of here.
it's dangerous.
it's back this way.
I don't see anything.
what kind of IRS agents are you?
rocky, scram! They're onto us!
Claudia, get her out of here!
Pete, we should go too! There's too many of them!
no, no, we're okay.
I know this movie, Dark Memento. After they shoot him, the bad guys take off.
rocky, listen.
no one's gonna know what happened here tonight.
you gotta be my mouthpiece, see?
Oh, he's about to die.
this is a great scene.
well, can't we change it?
I know, you don't do it for them.
no, it's no good.
this thing's on rails.
just stay out of the way and we won't get hurt.
you do it 'cause it's the right thing.
that's why we got into this lousy racket.
This--this, uh, this-- this film festival's chronological.
operation Dragon Wolf, Showdown at Laramie, Sword of the Gladiator
not his best work.
the next one is >Dr. Doomsday.
now get out there.
save the girl.
save the girl." Yeah!
okay, okay, so what happens in Dr. Doomsday?
Oh, really fun movie. He plays a mad scientist who blows up an entire town.
probably less fun if we all, you know, die.
so item 186 went dead letter?
what exactly is item 186?
well, 186-B is a camera in the Warehouse.
186-A is a transmutational delivery device.
it's supposed to transmit 3-D holographic images to the enemy, convince them that you're a lot closer and better equipped than they thought.
it worked, but...Too well.
it blew up in something called "Project Gemini" in 1944.
somehow light and matter coalesced and a 3-D projected Sherman tank became solid enough to shell the crowd.
how is that even possible?
you're still asking that question?
I'm still hoping for an answer.
Oh, dude, you're picking a lock. Can I do it?
no. - But it's been so long.
not long enough.
come on.
anyway, all I know is that the projector never got to the Warehouse.
I think that we can assume that it made it this far.
and somehow it's broadcasting the Raymond St. James Festival playing on movie classics unlimited.
Oh, I love that channel. - I know, right?
okay, since "how" isn't on the menu, do we have any idea "why"?
I don't know.
uh, signal flux, sunspots, uh...
intruding... - Wave diffraction... On the signal?
Yeah, maybe. All I know is, there's a pattern to the randomness.
I just don't know what it is yet.
Hey, guys, since we're here, can you keep an eye out for my stuff?
Oh, would you give that a rest, dude?
Hey, guys, over here.
the label's torn.
Yep. Stokes county, South Dakota.
enough to get it to the Post Office but no further.
do you remember what she said?
Yeah,"gonna eat some popcorn, watch some movies."
and who is "she"?
soon they'll know my power.
we'll return to the Raymond St. James marathon in just a moment.
don't go away. Dr. Doomsday is about to rock your world.
Yeah.
better than a flat screen.
hit the brakes, slick.
the darkness, the emptiness, that it's all for nothing.
MacPherson is still there.
no. It's him, but not him.
deep in her subconscious.
like grooves cut in vinyl.
you are the most unpredictable woman.
you must eradicate them.
smooth them over. Or she can go mad.
I'd seen the truth.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
Mrs. Frederic?
am I all right?
Yes. I believe you are now.
I didn't do anything wrong.
wait till you get your government pension check.
you'll take stuff home too.
Oh, yeah? Well, you stole the wrong package, lady.
okay, if the projector isn't plugged into the wall, then how is it being powered?
it's internal. Regenerative power... Source, the same as the... Farnsworths.
broadcasting on the same spectrum?
Mm-hmm, more than likely.
the movie's back on.
rest easy, my metal friend.
your labors are at an end.
doomsday's got a killer robot.
I went as that robot for Halloween.
Really? Was it recently? - Best candy haul ever.
the universe wants to be set free.
and he's got the bomb.
why don't we just cut the connection from the projector to the television?
does anyone have any better ideas?
...Humiliated or forced to stand by and watch men with puny minds steal my secrets.
as for imitators... Check.
solid core activator.
microwave.
intruding wave diffraction on the signal.
wait, is that what's kicking Raymond St. James out into the street?
make a lot of popcorn, do you?
well, how else do you watch a movie?
turn it back on. I want to see how it ends.
Yeah, well, you may have to live it, because we can't shut down every microwave and satellite dish in the state.
doomsday is here.
so, around here, right?
Yeah, it's-- that's what it says.
where?
I don't know. Maybe it's just a false alarm.
they thought I was mad!
mad! Now they shall all know my true genius!
it's not about cocktail parties and politics.
this thing is somehow buffering the input, and I think it's just gonna play the movie out, and then, when Dr. doomsday hits that button, boom!
kaboom!
we've got the camera. Why don't we just
interrupt this irregularly scheduled broadcast
by filming something benign-- and projecting our own drive-in movie.
it's in my car.
we can set it up in my Camino. - In whose Camino?
no, no.
how long do we have?
well, he's got about a three-minute monologue coming up, and then...
there is going to be an awful lot of life...
it looks like things are about to reach an explosive end after these words from the folks that pay the bills.
stay tuned.
well, we've got an extra three minutes.
well, unless someone fast-forwards through the commercials.
don't even joke about that.
Claudia, wait!
I got the parts you ordered.
it's not a question of madness.
okay, considering that the town's about to blow, we should probably use our guns. Just sayin'.
good point. Stay clear of the robot. He kills by crushing.
got it. Okay.
Seriously?
right. I forgot about the magnets.
what?
but the one constant through all of this...
how's this thing work?
well, just find something that looks like an "on" button and let's hope that the projector accepts the transmission.
now, focus on something benign.
not me!
I haven't been benign since 1956.
okay. Wait. What?
Why--why--why does the robot have your guns?
well, he kind of just reached down and took them.
all right, all right, all right!
just--you can sit this one out.
what? - It's fried!
Oh, no. The misfire in 1944 must have-- can you--?
wait.
give me your Farnsworths! Your Farnsworths, right now!
I can cannibalize these for parts.
no, we're gonna need five Farnsworths to fix this damage.
we're totally screwed.
I am going to destroy that glue.
here comes his big speech!
do you guys really work for the IRS?
what is that? - The parts you ordered. Found 'em.
you're a wonder twin!
here. - Got it.
Hey, hey, hey, you guys, hurry up.
there's only 15 more lines before kablooey!
resistor.
now would be nice. - Resistor. Thank you.
my reach extends far beyond this realm.
I will destroy everyone you love.
Wha--wha--what's-- what's the matter?
why "uh-oh"?
Artie, he changed his signature!
meaning what, exactly?
it's a totally different layout.
I'd have to reverse it. I need the Farnsworth blueprints.
no, no, they're locked in tech.
but I was just taking a gander at them back at Leena's.
well, I've got 'em-- well, here.
I mean, I read them this morning.
photographic memory? Me too.
who is this guy?
later. Farnsworth.
okay, imagine five of these, okay?
staggered diagonally, this section right here inverted, so how do I--?
you put that one there, and then you run-- you run this to there.
right, right.'Cause that would connect those two.
brilliant.
death takes many forms. I have created a few more myself, but then
what's the matter?
I need a fusible link! I don't have a fusible link!
what's fusible? Maybe I have one. - The car battery!
if you intended to make your life better-- yours, what then?
hurry up, guys!
are they to be removed, erased, eradicated? Yes.
Yes, of course.
okay, he's almost out of dialogue!
it's the countdown!
Oh, that's it! Here it is!
come on! I need that wire!
make the connection!
you have made me do this.
do something!
what's happening?
we connected a blue wire.
I have become... Death.
Claudia, I--good job.
any chance that went out to the entire Raymond St. James fan club?
I gave up Raymond St. James for this?
so that's how the power is generated.
I bet if I spend some time with this thing, I could rig it so I don't need to recharge.
maybe you should hold off on mentioning that to Artie.
good thought.
so, Claudia... - That's a scary tone.
Todd's cute. - Todd who?
this is me ignoring you.
I smell popcorn.
who wants to watch I Return to Kill, starring our new favorite actor?
you have got to be kidding me.
Yeah, I think I've seen enough of that dude's movies to last me a lifetime.
wussies. In my room in five, okay?
remember, I have a big flat screen.
well, item 186, Philo Farnsworth's parts A and B are right back where they-- ooh, popcorn.
deal me in. - Sure.
how else do you watch movies?
you know, if we want any of that popcorn...
so, about Todd... - Hey, wait up.
so, but he's really cute.
I might have to cut you.
guys, wait up.
we talked about it.
well, I think he's maybe, I don't know... The answer is no.
he may have left something behind.
an echo.
you want juice or are you a milk person?
know what I'd really like?
Oh, I do indeed, but falling off the wagon...May not be the best option.
haven't seen you around before. Are you new?
eight years, actually.
just-- just a minute.
what is this?
sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority.
what higher authori-- the Regents.
these are the Regents?
this waitress is a Regent?
who would you have control the Warehouse?
kings?
popes?
politicians?
be nothing left of it.
Mr. Valda, you tell me right to my face.
either fire me or kill me... Or let me do my job.
a missing walking stick?
a stick that causes earthquakes?
Really? - Say it.
it doesn't mean that this is it.
Oh, it kills you that I figured out one first.
just because the robberies involved... - Earthquakes.
what some people reported as earthquakes...
and there happens to be a piece missing from a nearby exhibit about an earthquake...
the largest one ever felt in England, a country not known for its earthquakes, by the way.
it doesn't mean that this is the artifact.
chin up, Watson, old Bean.
we can't all be as brilliant as Sherlock Lattimer.
Hey, Pete? - Yes?
the case is intact and the lock's not picked.
so what, inside job?
peruse their payroll?
after you.
victory lap.
will you get over yourself?
what's that you say?
grow up.
news flash! Stop. Bering to admit she was wrong.
stop!
you do see the "do not touch" signs everywhere?
new favorite job perk: Officially allowed to ignore velvet ropes.
I'm on this side. I'm on this side.
Hey, Pete. - Yeah?
the sign for the stick was still there.
okay? - Well, the museum hasn't reported a theft.
they haven't noticed it's gone.
he puts it back. When he's not using it.
Myka, look out!
you okay? - Yeah.
okay. - Okay.
that way? - I'm on it.
secret Service. One of your security guards is getting away with a stolen
you, hold it! - I don't have time for this.
Mrs. Frederic? - It's no time to explain.
this is of the utmost secrecy. You cannot tell Arthur or even Agent Bering.
okay.
I want you to throw this mission and let the artifact get away.
Mrs. Frederic, what is going on?
that's an order, Mr. Lattimer.
I'll contact you later.
go!
Pete, where's the guy?
I don't know.
I lost him.
I thought he was out here, but he's gone.
guess you can spare some time for us now.
Yeah, they're Secret Service.
we're not gonna press charges.
I thought fishing you out of custody would be like old times, Lattimer, but you and your friend are both fully clothed.
they catch you too early or too late?
well, I've matured since then.
I get arrested in my pants all the time now.
I'm guessing you two have met?
Kate Logan, Chicago field office.
the cops called us to check out your story.
and you heard my name and wanted to see me.
you know, I could just vouch for you and we could leave him at the early man exhibit.
awesome. I like her.
that's a good one.
I didn't know you transferred to Chicago.
I didn't know you transferred to super-secret South Dakota.
is that a promotion or a punishment?
Yeah, well, it depends on the day.
so far, today's good.
anyway, I got to get back to my case.
ahh, yeah, a stolen walking stick.
DEFCON Four.
well, it's part of my new look.
you know, top hat, monocle, big stick.
Mr. peanut. Very sexy.
so, uh, you showing up here mean I should call you, right?
call, don't call.
same as always.
play date over?
not if I can help it.
thief's name is Lenny Malone.
has a sheet--two petty thefts, one assault, and now he's in the wind.
we were in D. C. together. We used to
it's clear what you used to.
I'm more interested in what happened here last night.
nothing.
I just lost him.
you two out of the clutches of the Lakefield Police Department?
Yes, thanks to Pete's old girlfriend.
Yeah, I probably don't want to know what that means, but consider that the frying pan.
now get back here and brace yourselves for the fire.
so what's this about a fire?
agents Bering and Lattimer, back from losing another artifact.
once again involving local police and unauthorized members of the Secret Service.
we didn't lose an artifact.
no, no, no, no. Myka, Myka, guys. - I don't know who you are...
this is Benedict Valda. He's one of the Regents.
our Regents? The Regents?
no, Pete, the South Dakota college board of Regents. Yes, the Regents.
that's unusual, right?
an in-person visit from a Regent?
was unusual for the first 30 years that I worked here, but lately, I guess we just can't be trusted to do our jobs.
Mr. Valda could have done all this by courier, not brought my agents back from the field.
that's quite enough, Agent Nielsen.
I brought these agents back due to their repeated inability to protect this organization from unwanted scrutiny.
the Regents have decided to become more hands-on.
you, in particular, Miss. Donovan, should consider yourself on notice.
your inclusion in this group at all is a matter of lively debate.
don't waste any time on me. I'm just tech support.
Yes, you are.
I got this.
remember what I said.
I can input that. - I'll handle it.
I want you two back in Illinois. Find that stick.
what's going on? Why can't I see that? Is there something about me on there?
I cannot believe a Regent was just here and he's pissed at us.
this is probably your fault.
I never thought I'd be in a rush to get back to Lakefield, Illinois.
Pete, you coming?
uh, yeah.
I got a thing first.
I'm allowed to have a thing.
okay.
you know, it's a strange time to have a thing.
so what's with all the cloak and dagger?
keeping secrets from my team really isn't my thing.
get in.
some of the Regents are concerned about a pattern.
artifacts being used for criminal gain.
like Malone and the walking stick.
but that's not so unusual.
it is if it's someone on the inside.
we have every reason to believe that there's a breach, possibly at a high level.
we need your help in finding out who.
so if the Regents asked me to throw the case, why was Valda tearing me a new one?
that visit was planned some time ago.
any changes might have alerted our culprit.
look, okay, wait.
you can't be thinking that the breach is Artie or Myka.
have you forgotten recent events?
could you doubt that anyone could be compromised?
okay, so then why trust me?
because keeping secrets from your team really isn't your thing, which makes you the least likely suspect.
have I chosen poorly?
no, ma'am.
if our hunch is correct,
Malone's supplier will try to approach him for his cut of the take.
go to work as usual.
keep your eye on Malone.
if you need to contact me, you break the window at the end.
this is strictly between you and me. Understood?
good.
Hey, uh... So are we, like, friends now?
right. See ya.
what are you hiding from me, Artie?
schmancy new security measures.
I am impressed.
but did we remember all temp copies, mirror drives, and image backups?
silly "wabbit."
too easy.
"Donovan contingencies"?
cool. I'm the star of a Ludlum novel.
look, it's encrypted.
that's so cute.
so you think the cops already tossed it?
no, this looks like Malone grabbed some clothes and ran.
power's off.
are you trying to, you know, pump the electricity up to the light or
no.
geez, God, Myka.
well, is there something down there?
no. It's nothing.
I'm gonna go check his trash. You keep poking around here.
all right? - Yeah, okay.
Pete? Pete, where are you?
someone there?
Pete? - I got him. I got Malone! Come on!
wait a minute. Wait-- wait a minute.
I Tesla'd the guy.
he was out cold.
well, was he meeting someone? - Yeah, he was...
I mean, no. I didn't see anybody else.
you're sure it was Valda?
1, 000%.
did he see you? - I don't know.
but now we know it's not Artie or Myka, so let's bring them in on this.
listen carefully.
the Regents have kill authority on anyone deemed a threat to the Warehouse.
telling the others will only put them in harm's way.
well, then let's bring this guy down now.
leaping too quickly with someone like Valda will put a bullet in your head.
what we need is evidence.
Malone and the walking stick.
and I need for you to find him first before the police or Agent Bering.
I'll contact those Regents I know I can trust.
patience, Mr. Lattimer.
right, well, I'm not too good with patience.
challenge yourself.
where have you been? - I had a car thing.
you've been busy.
this is everything from Malone's apartment.
you know, something doesn't add up.
okay, I'm him, right?
I have... the walking stick.
I mean, why do I go back to the apartment?
did I stash something else that I need?
is that the walking stick?
no, Pete. This is a snack.
did you check the last number dialed?
no, I didn't. That's a good idea.
the phone Jack's over there.
pines Place Motel.
if he wasn't meeting anyone else in the apartment, then why was he there?
Yeah, got me.
is there anything? - Nope.
the last number dialed was take-out.
I'm gonna go check his trash. You keep poking around here.
I got a thing first.
I'm allowed to have a thing.
I lost him.
you want to talk about this?
this is why I said leave it alone.
then maybe you shouldn't have put it on the computer.
that's like me leaving a cake out with a note on it that says, "not for Artie."
that was one time and I
don't you have a boyfriend that you could be irritating instead of me?
he dumped me.
Oh, I didn't know. Do you want me to call him?
this is a list of ways to kill me.
Oh, they're not... all killing you.
there're other options here.
erase her memory"?
well, that's comparatively humane.
drop her in a non-English-speaking country"?
see, they're just trying to stall for time.
they know you're gonna find your way back.
that doesn't make me feel any better!
don't you think that there's a file like this on all of us?
don't you know that there's one with my name on it?
and are you okay with that?
Claudia... You are a valued member of this team and no one is gonna erase your memory or dispose of your body in a vat of acid.
is that on here too?
Oh, my God. - It's there?
I think Pete's drinking again.
what?
no.
what?
no, no, no. What?
we're just asking because we're worried about you.
Yeah, bro. We're your friends.
tell me this is some kind of a-- a weird, uncomfortable surprise party.
Pete, you've been acting strange this whole case.
you've been lying. You've been making up excuses to be alone.
look, your hands are shaking.
for crying out loud, you-- you
I'm sorry.
you guys, this is sweet, really, but you're wrong, okay?
you're wrong. In eight years, I haven't even had a virgin daiquiri.
then what?
I'm not drinking.
that was quick.
secrets are a naughty thing, Peter.
you listen up, Valda.
look behind the tree in front of you.
Valda... - you two have been busy little bees.
she'll never see your signal, by the way.
where is she? - She's alive.
I have a man watching her through the scope of a rifle.
I need you to tie up one loose end for me.
Oh, yeah? And what's that?
Mr. Malone. Where is he?
no, no, first, you call your man off Mrs. Frederic.
I'm afraid not.
when I call you again, be ready to deliver Malone.
now how do I know you won't kill her anyway?
you're in no position to quibble, Peter.
I could kill your whole team.
the others don't know anything! Okay? You leave them out of this.
that's entirely up to you.
are we clear? - Here's what's clear, pal.
you tell me I have something you want and then you threaten my friends.
so you are going down.
game on.
game on!
he's not at the B&B.
his cell goes straight to voicemail.
he's taking himself off the grid.
he left this.
agent Kate Logan.
Pete Lattimer.
damn it.
okay, uh, tell her I need an address for a Benedict Valda.
Thanks.
Lakefield.
pines Place Motel.
Hey, buddy boy.
remember me?
I'm the guy from the museum you tried to kill with the battle Axe.
now how do I find Benedict Valda?
who? - Valda!
the guy you met in the alley.
or should I hand you over to him like he wants?
I don't know any Valda.
okay, all right, look. I took the stick from the exhibit. I admit it.
you're working together.
I saw you paying him off.
look, you're crazy, man.
no, no! Okay.
where is it? - It's under the bed.
Hey, handsome.
what can I get you?
you feeling all right?
um, yeah. It's just a long night. That's all.
thank God.
coffee?
maybe you should stick with decaf? - That's a good idea.
two, please.
coming up.
okay, first, that message was the least-romantic Booty call ever.
what is with this Valda character?
Why? Why? Did something happen?
guy doesn't exist on paper, but ever since I poked, my place was trashed, my phone's been bugged, and someone's been tailing me.
when I find that S. O.B.I am gonna
don't worry. I'm a big girl, but someone's definitely sending a message.
either that or you've gone way too far making up an excuse to see me.
no.
it isn't me.
you're still hot, but not "trash your place just to get a date" hot.
it's happened. - I'm sure.
okay, then... Think it's time you let me in.
what's the division you're working for?
well, let's just say I'm in containment of threats.
to the President? - To the planet.
okay, okay. Right. I know. I know.
I know it sounds like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat to keep the aliens from stealing my thoughts, but, Kate, I'm serious.
I can't tell you what I do.
Thanks.
so Valda, how does he fit in?
he's way up the food chain, and bad.
like, Keyser Soze bad.
I don't think this is decaf.
okay, how are you supposed to find him?
when he came to visit us... He had a driver and a limo.
so they had to get gas, right?
maybe he used a credit card or, you know, got themselves on camera.
you're going to check every gas station, restaurant, and rest stop for 100 miles?
where I work, there's only, like, six.
still a lot of legwork.
look, if your partner and everyone you worked with had their lives threatened, wouldn't you do it?
Yeah.
thanks for dragging me into your fun world.
I thought you were happy to see me.
I kind of liked you better when you were helpless, pantsless Pete.
well, the pants are imminently removable.
what?
I honestly had no idea this is where my day was headed.
everyone's hands where I can see 'em!
Logan, get out of here.
what?
Myka, what the hell are you doing?
what am I doing? You've gone AWOL.
you've stolen an artifact and you won't tell anyone what's going on.
what am I supposed to think?
Mrs. Frederic can explain it.
Mrs. Frederic is missing.
Valda is calling the shots and he thinks you had something to do with it.
Myka, Valda is the guy I'm after.
if Mrs. Frederic is missing, then he either has her or she is dead.
look, all I know is I have my orders.
don't make me do this the hard way, Pete.
come on!
Pete, do not get in that car!
Pete, please! Hands on the wheel!
Hey, Myka! Myka, put the gun away and we'll talk, okay?
you have no idea what Valda is capable of!
Pete, just come with me and we'll sort this out, okay?
Lattimer, get in the car!
Logan, please! I'm just trying to keep you alive, okay?
take the shot. Take the shot!
No!
Oh, my God. Kate.
wait. Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am, you c
it's all right.
Kate, Pete's in trouble.
Pete's stuck in some sort of paranoid delusion.
the way that he ran.
the note. He thinks that someone is out to get him.
we don't have any of the details yet, but we think that he was affected by, um...Something during a mission.
right. Your "secret" missions.
why come to me?
well, one, he called you, so whatever's going on in his head, you must be a part of it and...
Two...Well... He's back on your turf.
we pulled this off a Chicago city surveillance Cam.
Yeah. What is he doing?
I think he thinks that he's kissing you.
but it could be you though, right?
it's highly doubtful. My money's on you.
he left you a message?
Yeah, it was weird.
here.
so why is he fixated on Valda?
I think his mind is scrambling together details from his life the way you do when you're dreaming.
he's constructing some kind of fantasy with Valda and Malone, the walking stick.
well, could this walking stick have caused it?
it didn't affect Malone.
no, I think whatever this is, it started in that museum.
did Pete touch anything while you were there?
Artie, it's Pete. It would be easier to list the things that he didn't touch.
Oh, God. Okay, show me.
okay, he played with, um, some of these billiard balls.
Myka, Myka, what else? What else? What else?
then he played with these glasses and this pipe.
why did you let him touch all those things?
what am I, his kindergarten teacher?
Plus, you know, we didn't know there would be two artifacts in the same place.
Myka, it's a museum.
it is filled with things from historical events.
anything there could be an artifact.
you cannot let him touch anything.
Artie, it's Pete, okay?
it's a win when he doesn't lick anything.
Yes, what else? All right, fine.
all right, he put this thing in his ear.
that's a good way to get an infection if you ask me, but...
then he-- oh, he clicked this telegraph, then-- oh, right, then he
wait, wait, wait. - What?
telegraph? Go back. Go back. Go back. Show me the telegraph.
here you go. It's military. 1860s.
telegraph Island, Oman.
telegraph Island?
Oh, my. Wait, wait, wait. I know that.
that sounds familiar.
Myka, wait. Wait one second.
all right. Telegraph Island.
a remote outpost between England and India in the mid-1800s.
reported that every-- every soldier posted there went violently insane.
well, that-- it sounds "artifacty," right?
you think?
no, wait.
it hasn't affected anyone since.
well, is this it or not?
only one way to find out.
Pete, it's Myka.
just tell me that you can hear me.
Yeah. Yeah, I can hear you.
I just don't know what to say to you.
I keep--I keep telling myself it wasn't our fault.
and I couldn't say anything to you, because I was trying to protect you.
I'm here, Pete. I'm safe.
got Katie killed.
what? No, no, Pete.
Kate's-- Kate's alive, okay?
I just left her.
Pete, you've been affected by an artifact, the telegraph.
I think you're hallucinating.
Valda's filled your head with lies.
but I'm about to fix all that.
so you, and Leena, Artie, Claudia, you guys will all be safe.
Pete, no, okay?
don't do whatever it is you're about to do.
okay?
you might feel something strange.
anything?
I've been listening, Peter. - Valda?
Pete, did you hear what I just said?
Where's Myka?
now you've compromised the others.
do you realize what I'll have to do?
Valda, I'll trade you Malone for Mrs. Frederic.
I don't know how to reach you.
you meet me at the Kemper recycling yard.
Hey, boss.
there's no effect. He's still inside of whatever's going on.
at least now we know where he's going.
and I think I have just the thing to restore Pete's neural rhythm.
agent Lattimer!
I understand you want to speak with me.
what in God's name... - shut up.
I've heard enough of your voice to last a lifetime.
I don't know what this is all about, Agent Lattimer, but you have my attention. All right?
you recognize this?
it appears to be the artifact that you were after, the walking stick.
it appears to be the-- the artifact you're after.
shut up!
we're all alone out here, Valda.
quit playing the game.
I got the stick, I got Malone, and I got you.
now what did you do with Mrs. Frederic?
Mrs. Frederic?
look, I want to help you.
but none of this can be
Myka tried that line on me.
she was a good little soldier.
she fed me your garbage about a telegraph that's making me see things.
telegraph?
time is running out, Benedict.
telegraph.
what do you remember? Is there anything unusual about it?
think!
just stop trying to confuse me!
I'm not confusing you.
you're seeing clearly.
try to remember.
I said shut up!
agent Bering.
be careful. - Myka!
look, this is gonna sound kinda freaky, but... Are you guys really here?
cause Valda's been messing with my head, and I don't know what's real anymore.
Yeah, we're really here.
okay?
and we're gonna help you get outta this.
Oh, they're here, Peter.
almost ready.
you really think I'd come here without backup?
Myka, you and Artie, you gotta get outta here.
he's got-- he's got snipers all over the place.
where is Mrs. Frederic?
Artie. - Agent Nielsen!
I am aware of the urgency.
I've got something that'll reset his neural rhythm
the original studio master of Oye Como Va.
music to die by, hey, Peter?
just stop it!
you stop!
okay, listen to me, Pete.
I really need you to not do that again, okay?
the irony is Myka's gonna kill you for me.
she has to protect the Regent.
and then I'll kill them before your body's even cold.
this music is just not getting through.
he's still listening to that telegraph.
Myka, he wants to kill us all.
you and Artie just get outta here!
agent Nielsen!
Yeah, I'm-- i'm working on it.
you back off!
you hear me?
you back off or I'll kill him!
I've got to find something that can
I've got it.
okay, Pete, I'm gonna come over there, and you're gonna give me your gun, okay?
here it comes, Peter.
stop!
I hope the aural and visual combination shocked him back to reality and didn't turn him into a...
my eye's already open, Artie.
Hey, are you okay?
uh... I have no freakin' idea.
well improvised, Agent Nielsen.
Yes, there is a madness to the method.
agent Nielsen.
yes?
Yeah, of course.
what happened?
it's a long story.
Oh, God.
are you here to kill me?
if I was, you'd already be dead, and I'd be halfway to dinner.
Yeah, you know, it's just 'cause I shot at a Regent.
Mr. Valda, though unhappy, understands the circumstances.
Yeah, well... I'm not sure I understand the circumstances.
the telegraph seems to have tapped into some subliminal anxiety, not surprising given what you've all been through of late.
sorry.
I just wanted to make sure you were real.
take some time off, Agent Lattimer.
Yes, ma'am. I'm just gonna finish up these reports.
and, you know, it's funny, we
how does she do that?
I'll be at the Warehouse.
Oh, Artie, hey, listen, I understand the need for that contingency file.
so if you ever have to take me out...
this is how you want to die? - Yeah.
well... I do know how to reach David Bowie.
Yes!
you rock.
Oh, Pete, there's an envelope on the table for you, from Kate Logan.
are you gonna call her?
Nah, I don't think so.
well, why not? I mean, you must have some feelings for her.
she was, after all, in your fantasy.
Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Freud.
open it.
open it.
hope you're better.
Myka forgot this.
thought you'd want it.
Oh, God. - What?
just don't play that.
I mean, you're not interested in her anyways, right?
so you can't--oh.
Pete, you're just... - What? what?
I'm not unless she is.
Ugh, oh, God. You're gonna be embarrassed.
Pete, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so
even by myself, I still got moves.
Yes, yes, yes.
you know they called me "Gene Simmons" in High School.
don't stop.
you're insane.
come on old friend so what, you think our Jimmy took a playdate?
if there's a history log in here, we could look up...
there.
Pete, Artie says that H. G. Wells is actually - a woman...
could you please be careful with that - I know all about it. - You what?
I was Apprenticed at Warehouse 12.
Cavorite was an anti-gravity metal that Wells about, but Cavorite doesn't exist.
I'm sorry, Arthur.
you stop trying to confuse me!
Pete, you've been infected by an artifact.
Myka, you and Artie, you got to get out of here.
he's got snipers all over the place!
the telegraph seems to have tapped into some subliminal anxiety.
take some time off, Agent Lattimer.
I guess I'm just lucky that the only vet in Univille makes house-calls.
I love ferrets.
besides, this is a farming community and if I didn't make house-calls, my office would look like a traveling circus.
guess how many croissants I shoved into my mouth at once.
one day you'll have to tell me how you got partnered up with that one.
well, the croissant thing's actually kind of impressive when you see it.
Yeah, at least it keeps him from talking.
Oh, that's right. You prefer your males to bark and hump your leg.
I'm sure it's in your repertoire.
okay, okay. Thank you.
you know, we have to get back to work, but thank you so much for coming.
Myka, for you, anytime. - Okay.
what is with you two? - She started it.
good, good, you're here. Follow me.
we got a ping.
awesome. Time to get back out there and kick some artifact butt.
Mmm, not you, no.
until we're sure that there's no residual effect from your last encounter, you are grounded.
Myka, you're going to Tamalpais University in Northern California.
Artie, this is about a wrestling team.
God, all right, all right. Yes, yes.
it's about a wrestling team.
this wrestling team, they've lost every match for the last seven years and overnight, they've become unstoppable.
no, this is-- this is one of ours.
I know you wrestled in college.
what can I say? Irony is my specialty.
so-- grounded!
this team was tested for steroids, right?
one of the kids on the team died three weeks ago, in a fire, alone, camping.
if an artifact is helping them, it could also be killing them.
okay, I'm on it.
Yeah, Claudia, take this, because you're going with Myka to California as a backup.
for reals?
my first official assignment as an Agent?
shut up! As... - An Apprentice.
while you're on campus, enroll and get a degree, will you?
will you never stop with that?
Tamalpais UNIVERSITY
should I have worn something more business-suity, you know, so people take me seriously as an Agent?
you're not an Agent. You're an Apprentice.
right. Apprentice. Taking notes. "Jeans are fine.
well, it looks like they won again.
think the artifact's in here?
anything's possible, but artifacts don't talk.
people talk.
right.
interviews with people, indeed.
I'm ready to begin my Apprentice education.
always happy to answer questions on how much we're winning, but I'm not sure what exactly you're investigating.
apprentice really be in here?
we just have some routine questions for you.
Gary, come talk to these ladies.
sure, Coach. What's up?
Hi, Gary, is it?
so why do you think your team started winning?
I mean, what changed?
coach Tappon finally got our asses in gear.
he got us to want it again.
and if you want it bad enough, you're gonna crush it.
and now we're crushing it.
but seven straight seasons without a win and now all of a sudden
Claudia, do you want to see what's going on out in the hallway?
okay, thanks, bye.
Hey.
Hey, aren't you the guy who just won?
I feel weird.
my muscles are hurting bad.
I think I need a
one death on the team is bad enough.
two is...Unthinkable.
but I know Phillip would want us to go on.
how'd it go with the police?
he just caught on fire, Myka.
I should have done something.
there wasn't anything to do.
you would have done something.
you would stay calm at least. I literally freaked out.
so the police are calling it an accident?
of undetermined cause.
but I hacked the coroner's report on both desks.
check it out. Teddy Benson, the wrestler who died in the campsite fire?
burn patterns show that the fire started inside his sleeping bag.
okay, so two deaths by spontaneous combustion on the same wrestling team.
Yeah, I call shenanigans.
and unless a sweaty gym sock is the artifact, then there's nothing that
okay, there's that.
Oh, yeah. You can score that a 9. 8.
all right, I'm gonna go talk to the Coach about that medal and you follow up with the team.
wait. Follow up? By myself?
Yeah. Talk to them. You know, investigate.
sure. Yeah, I'll just follow up.
ahh, mom! - Pete!
are those Timothy Leary's glasses?
take them off right now. That's not a toy.
I'm bored, okay? They make things so much less boring.
did you hear what I said? Take them off right now. Right now.
wouldn't you rather have a nice little fish?
okay, stop it.
give me the glasses. - Don't!
get up out of my chair.
child.
man, desk duty is lame.
Oh, it's nothing personal, senor sensitivo.
no. Ow.
what? What? What is it?
it's nothing. It's no big deal.
it's just probably my appendix growing back.
your who with the what now?
Yeah, it's, uh...
grows back every year.
it's a side effect of spending too much time in the Warehouse.
nothing to worry about. It's all good.
Yeah, I need a visit from the doctor. Yeah.
what?
are you serious?
touching a gold medal caused them to burn up?
you got both paddles in the water?
you were a champion. Now you're a Coach.
I know what it's like to do good work and no one notices.
a winning team puts you back on top.
you think I'm involved in their deaths?
you're out of your mind.
if I'm crazy, show me the medal.
I'm not showing you anything.
coach Tappon, we'd love for you to join us whenever you're free.
great, Jeff. I'm sorry.
just give me a sec. Be right with you.
great.
now I'm pissing off the team's benefactors so you can accuse me of attacking my guys.
I am just trying to protect
if you scare my guys, I'll have you thrown off this campus.
so, Gary, is it?
Yeah. Um...
can I help you?
so Coach Tappon.
does he ever seem maybe too intent on winning?
too intent on winning"?
I don't even know what that means.
I mean does he put you under a lot of, you know, pressure?
pressure?
have you ever tried getting out of a half nelson with a 200-pound monster's on top of you?
okay, now when you say, "monster,
I'm gonna assume you mean a really big guy and not an actual monster, because in my line of work
what I mean is pressure is good. It makes you win.
okay, yes, but does the Coach care about your safety or just winning?
would he risk a wrestler's life to, I don't know, place in a match
Hey, this is my Coach we're talking about.
I'm not gonna let you rip on him.
Oh, no, no, no. No, I wouldn't deign to rip.
I'm just...
observing, analyzing the facts, supposing a possible-- interrogating the
not that you - you okay?
you seem kind of new at this.
are you, like, that other lady's assistant or something?
or something.
if I need anything, I'll circle back.
thanks so much for coming, doctor.
and how's that? Does that hurt?
it's fine. No, no.
how about there? - No.
so our own Warehouse doctor, huh?
Yes, Pete, it's in the manual, chapter 112, section F, paragraph 3.
Yeah, yeah.
I haven't quite gotten to chapter 112 yet.
Yeah, why don't you go downstairs and read it right now?
well, I was hoping you'd read it to me, papa.
Vanessa, I'm really sorry about him.
and I'm sorry you have to come all the way to South Dakota just for this.
Oh, well, your appendix is always the highlight of my year, Artie.
what's the rest of your year like?
have you been working on your meridians?
the acupuncture points I asked you to tap on like this.
Yeah, just--I remember. Ah!
I'm really ticklish there. You can't do that.
I know. Sit up. - Okay.
Yes, I have, actually. I've worked on - oh, you're lying. - Yes, I am.
if you're gonna blow hot air, will you mind blowing into this for me, please?
well, you're not infected.
Oh, that's good, right? - Yeah, it's good.
given your proclivity to appendicitis,
I really still think we should remove it again.
okay. - Just prophylactically.
Prophylactically? - Shut up.
I place myself in your hands.
okay, let me go put on some scrubs.
prepare the procedure room and I'll let you know when I'm ready for you, okay?
okay, awesome.
maybe I'm wrong, but...
are Vanessa and Artie sitting in a tree?
Ah, don't be absurd.
we're two adults who just have a lot of professional respect for each other.
and shut up. - K-I-s-s-I-n-g.
I knew it. Newsflash: Artie is human.
walk away. - You like her.
stop it. - You want to hug her and kiss her...
right. I'm walking away. - And squeeze her and all right!
don't touch me there.
good, you've got the purple goo.
coach Tappon's office is empty.
Artie said there's no record of Tappon's medal on file, but we should still goo it just in case.
it was hard to hear.
Pete kept singing something about Artie in a baby carriage.
good. Well, let's go get this medal.
do you think he's doing this on purpose?
no, but I think he's hiding something.
how can you tell, like, just from one interview?
I mean, is that instinct?
well, instinct is just a fancy way of saying
I've done this 10, 000 times.
you don't think maybe this guy's different?
well, human beings are predictable and people rarely surprise you.
turn around and put your hands in the air.
slowly.
agent Bering.
seems we're forever destined to meet at gunpoint.
ladies, I know this is a bit awkward, but maybe we could just
or we could just do this.
you are going back to the Bronze Sector.
Why? What did I do?
you're a killer and a thief.
brain requires... Oxygen...
to speak. - Myka.
I'm not a killer.
Oh, has the definition of "killer" changed a bunch since the 1890s?
cause, H.G. you killed a guy.
he would have quite happily killed all of you.
why are you here?
did you just happen to show up?
I'm hunting for the same artifact as you.
that's what we're looking for.
that's rather my point.
take it.
and if you didn't believe me just a little, you'd have shot me by now.
the Coach.
he can't find us here.
he can't find you in here.
he hasn't met me yet.
what? Do not. Don't. No.
is your name Coach Tappon? - Yeah.
Oh, thank God I've found you.
she's good.
Yeah, sure, in an obvious kind of way.
worked on Pete in London.
well, that's not exactly scaling Mt. Everest, is it?
come on, let's call Artie.
an appendectomy? Are you
Yeah, forget-- I'm fine.
just tell me exactly what's going on.
room's all set. Are you?
uh, as ever.
just one second, cause I'm in the - okay.
Yeah, look - you know what? I got it.
just--just take care of yourself.
okay, thanks.
my turn. Oh.
don't start without me.
what?
nothing.
I was just wondering...
what this...
was doing on your shelf.
Yeah, I'm wondering what you're doing messing around with my thing.
that's the Barnum to Ba-bam!
Oh, that's right, sir.
I've been doing a little read-a-roonie of the artifact manifest.
fascinating stuff. Turns out P. T. Barnum used this to, and I quote, "increase the shock factor "in his sideshows by using it to grow human limbs and in some cases, internal organs.
you, sir, have been growing back your appendix in an attempt to get Vanessa to visit the Warehouse!
that's so romantic.
are you quite finished?
if only... - So, "no," then.
there were some way for you to...
interact with Vanessa that did not involve invasive surgery.
perhaps some kind of
I don't know. Social ritual.
one involving the sharing of food or the enjoying of filmed entertainment with maybe some duds that have been milked.
I mean a date. - I know what you mean.
Artie, you like her.
She--hey, hey, hey--likes you.
ask the woman out. - Okay.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to postpone the surgery.
a Regent has tungsten poisoning, of all things, and I have to leave for Budapest immediately.
Ooh, that sounds serious there.
you should go. - All right.
I got to make my flight arrangements.
get out of my sight. Don't come near me. I'll kill you.
Really? Nothing?
Nope.
the medal is not the artifact, which also means that H. G. had nothing to lose by handing it over.
unless she didn't know either. - Oh, she knew.
I don't know what her game is, but I don't trust her.
well, I swiped Tappon's records from the personnel office.
last month, he moved to bayside heights.
very schmancy and Richie Rich.
where does a college wrestling Coach get the money to buy a house like that?
maybe H. G.'S paying him off.
where would she get the money? - Well, you accrue a lot of interest in 100 years.
I'm gonna go snoop around for a connection.
you finish interviewing the wrestling team.
um, no, maybe I should stick to the computer stuff.
I'm really not good at the interviews, especially with, you know, people.
okay, so... Why do you say that?
well, I tried to be like you, you know?
all professional and adult and that
is really...
really dumb.
is that your version of a pep talk? - No.
we already have one me.
we don't need another me, okay?
I want you to go in there and be more like you.
what would that get us?
Claudia, you're the same age as these guys.
you're a peer. You can connect with them.
Yeah, not so much.
okay. Okay then.
go back to the Warehouse then.
you know, not everyone's cut out for field work.
you know, stay behind a computer forever.
forever's kind of a long time.
I don't have time to hold your hand through this, Claude.
if you are not up for this - well, I didn't say that.
okay, well, let me know how it goes.
okay, I will. - Good then. Good.
Oh, I know what you did there. - I know.
it's 'cause you're smart.
go.
Gar-bear, afternoon.
let's talk. - Hey.
irritating question girl.
we kind of already talked.
no, you already avoided telling me anything.
now we talk.
by the way, Photoshop.
anyway, check this.
Phillip and Teddy's deaths were not accidental.
my Intel says Coach is dirty.
maybe even got some payola.
thoughts?
Stratego. What do you know?
nothing.
it's just a feeling.
spill it, hulkling. Don't make me angry.
coach Tappon saved us, okay?
I mean, in a town like this, you either work at the bottling plant or you get out.
and now even the plant's about to close down.
because of Coach, now I have options and maybe a scholarship.
I have people who did that for me too.
gave me options.
then you know I can't turn on him.
Yeah, but, dude...
if something bad's happening to your friends, even by accident, don't you owe them too?
he started acting weird after Teddy died.
closed-door meetings, phone calls in the middle of practice.
he was acting - guilty?
no.
scared.
no, it's too dangerous.
listen to me. They think I'm responsible.
and what if I am?
no, I'm sorry, but I'm ending this now.
okay, here's here we go. What you're gonna do.
set something up for when she gets back.
dinner, a movie-- shh! Shh!
I can't do that.
take her for a walk. Show her the dark vault.
doesn't matter, okay?
just make a plan.
I don't know-- okay.
then be one of those agents that's obsessed with the Warehouse.
that always works out so well.
all right.
well, now you know you're not infected, so you should be all right till I get back, Artie.
you okay with this?
have a nice flight.
Thanks.
geez, Artie, it's not like she hasn't already seen you naked.
thank you very much for that.
this was no accident.
it means someone else out there knows about the artifact.
look who's here.
keep an eye on things, Claude.
Hey!
our lead suspect is killed and look who shows up.
Oh, do stop it.
what motive could I have possibly had for killing those boys and a wrestling Coach?
that's an excellent question.
perhaps we should ask the Regents.
they did have you bronzed once.
you know as well as I, women are held to a different standard.
something, by the way, I thought would have changed by now.
don't you dare play that card with me.
why not?
your partner died and people whispered.
if you'd been a man - nice.
that's very clever. You did your research.
what did you steal from the Escher Vault?
that's what I thought.
I took back what was mine.
Oh, and what is that?
that more Cavorite?
what are you gonna do, yank me up into the sky?
the only power it has is over me.
it's my daughter.
was.
my Christina.
everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now, except the Warehouse.
look, I know what it's like to lose someone, but
I want to come back and work there again.
you what? - That's why I'm doing all of this.
to prove I am still a good Agent.
look, I'm sorry about your little girl.
I really am.
but it's not possible - please?
you can't - please?
every day in this world is a reminder of what I've lost.
my child, my friends, my life.
I have no tether here.
the Warehouse is the only home I have now.
I do miss the horse and buggy days.
progress is in many ways overrated.
a grappling hook?
I designed it myself.
what?
nothing.
it's just a little old fashioned.
well, it wasn't when I invented it.
and it seems to have saved your life.
and yet you're still wondering if I set this whole thing up just to prove my innocence.
well, the thought did cross my mind somewhere between, "holy crap, I'm gonna die,
and, "oh, I'm flying!
and what have you concluded?
the jury's still out.
I suppose if we work together, it may be faster.
and you could keep an eye on me.
Yes.
that thought crossed my mind too.
you coming?
Hey, look what I found.
tag says it reduces shyness, so I
pain. Lots.
not good. Never hurt like this before.
well, that's 'cause the doc always took it out.
Yeah, must still be growing.
might keep growing till it bursts.
you know, this is called breaking and entering these days.
it always was.
things haven't changed much.
uh, why don't you take the desk? I'll go through the closet.
aye, aye.
so you built that gun, huh?
you are coveting my grappler.
old fashioned, indeed.
admiring maybe.
not coveting.
my technical skill could come in very handy when I come back to work.
why were you bronzed?
the scales that lady justice holds are more easily tipped than one knows.
the world is never as you think it should be.
well, it's not my decision anyway.
you know, I don't even think it's Artie's.
of course. No pressure.
just making conversation.
pointed conversation, but nevertheless
here. Let me do it.
H. G. come here. Look at these pictures.
these are all of Phillip, only he's
quite a bit more of a roly-poly.
look at the dates on these files.
he did this in three weeks.
something's turning these boys into perfect specimens.
and then killing them.
just a little farther, Artie.
to this chair.
Oh, little help here.
at some point, you people will have to realize that "Veterinarian" means "animal doctor," not humans.
Hey, I don't want to be here either, so
look, Doc Wellins is out of town.
his appendix is about to burst, so it's either the vet or the barber.
an appendectomy?
you do realize that most of the surgeries
I perform are spaying and neutering?
okay, the barber. The barber.
Oh! Look, Artie. Please sit down.
okay. - I mean, come on. Help the guy out.
Hey, I can make him look like a giant walrus, if that makes it any easier.
Artie, I will help you, if only to take you out of his care.
good idea. - Come on. Let's go to the exam room.
Hey, croissant-boy, I need a prep nurse. Get in here.
okay, but I'm not shaving anything.
more wrestlers are getting sick.
pretty soon the whole team's gonna end up extra crispy.
that's strange.
why would they put a padlock on a fridge?
boiling Point Energy Drink"?
Myka, every time I saw Gary, he was chugging one of these drinks.
it's the drink.
Claudia, you have to get to Gary and warn him.
on it. - The artifact is in the drink.
boiling POINT PLANT
so Dr. Mahoney, you created the Boiling Point formula?
Yes, and there's nothing harmful in it.
it's vitamins, caffeine, amino acids.
it's like any other drink on the market except that ours is specially formulated to accelerate muscle growth.
it helps people.
you're testing it on the wrestling team at Tamalpais.
there are laws against that.
nonsense! It was a focus group.
the kids were getting faster, stronger
and combustible.
boiling Point financially supports the team and you paid Coach Tappon to get them to drink.
that wasn't my idea!
it was mine.
Jeff Russell. Welcome, ladies.
Gerald, they're looking for you in the lab.
great.
on campus, you pulled Coach Tappon into a meeting.
boiling Point is your company.
founder and CEO, miss?
agent Bering, Secret Service.
and you are?
agent Wells.
who is also an Agent under me.
does whatever I say.
lots of companies support school teams and we owe a lot to this town.
and for me, it was personal.
you were on the wrestling team?
coach Tappon helped to focus my life.
I wanted to give something back. So what?
so people died.
coach Tappon died.
and I'm sad about that.
but I'm still waiting to hear your proof that my drink was responsible.
or you could come with me and I can prove to you that it's completely harmless.
might be a trap.
usually is.
here's my impression of Pete at the sight of blood.
no, no, no, no, no. - Yes.
I never sounded like
okay, that's fairly accurate.
just 'cause I was worried about him.
Oh, right, right. It's sweet.
a little girly, but sweet. - Girly.
Artie, we thought you would recuperate better here, but you got to promise that you're gonna try to get some rest.
great. Artie loves resting.
Oh, and he will, because I'm putting you in charge.
if he's not up on his feet in a couple of days, - I'm coming after you. - You're in charge?
that's right, old boy.
I'll go get you some soup. - Okay.
you should ask her out. - Me ask her out?
Yeah. - Right.
or be one of those agents obsessed with the Warehouse.
that always works out so well.
you weren't talking to me.
Oh, no? - No.
Oh, well, who was I talking to?
I don't know. Let's just see.
when I died in the tunnel, didn't you think for just an instant, "poor Artie.
he gave his life to this place and he died alone"?
and since then, I see what's been happening to you.
what happening? No happening.
I think you're worried that you caught a glimpse into your own future.
Oh, those painkillers are making you loopy, old boy.
Oh, no, I'm not on any painkillers.
and then your stuff didn't come from home, so you feel uprooted and last week, you imagined reconnecting to an old girlfriend.
in my defense, I do have a lot of those dreams.
Yeah.
you don't have to miss out on having a real life like I did.
I'd be honored to have a life like yours.
I'd be honored if you'd try for a little more.
dude, you look like Bantha poodoo.
well, as you can see, I feel fantastic.
spread the word to your teammates.
stop drinking those dumb energy drinks.
and I need your help.
Why? What's wrong with
no, just trust me. The bottling plant, you said it was closing down.
Why? - I don't know.
it's some kind of deal to sell it off or something.
talk to me more about that.
I found some tea.
why don't you people have soup? I mean, everybody has soup.
we're weird.
surgery was fun, huh?
you got some moves with that knife.
Hey. - Want to get dinner?
or coffee. Pastries.
the hardware store has a candy aisle.
we're not going out. - We could stay inside.
I heard the hardware store delivers candy.
look, my ex, it turns out he's a giant tool box and I moved to a place where I couldn't possibly meet any cute men, so
A-ha! You think I'm cute.
Pete, we're not going out.
Yeah, but you think I'm cute.
as you can see, there's nothing dangerous in the drink.
well, do you collect test samples from every batch?
for safety purposes.
it's standard practice. Why?
that ladle.
is that what your people use to collect the samples?
I suppose. - Myka, do you know Godfrid's Spoon?
no.
we looked for it at Warehouse 12.
Godfrid Haraldsson, a Viking Prince.
it's supposedly forged from the armor of fallen warriors.
his men would drink from it before battle.
it gave them strength.
what are you talking about?
Mr. Russell, where did you get this ladle?
I don't know. It's always been here.
Myka, this plant's closing.
production moves to Naperville, Illinois, in three weeks.
what's in Naperville, Illinois? - Omnico Headquarters.
they're buying Boiling Point.
beaucoup bucks for the founder.
that gives you motive to keep the deaths quiet until the deal goes through and it's not your problem anymore.
this belongs to me.
Gerald, what are you doing?
you have no right to come in here.
that ladle touches every batch of Boiling Point.
you don't have to answer their questions, Jeff.
Mr. Russell, does Dr. Mahoney have stake in your company's sale to Oomnico?
gerald's been with Boiling Point since the beginning.
Jeff - he must have a fortune in stock options by now.
Jeff, shut up.
Gerald, for God's sakes, give them the ladle.
no. - Hey! Hey!
No! - No! What are you doing?
no, Claudia!
grab Mahoney!
Gerald, what have you done?
he's about to tell us right now.
if Omnico finds out the drink is flawed, the sale doesn't go through.
what's gonna happen to her?
the more you take in, the quicker it seems to take effect.
and it's seeping directly into her pores.
I'm afraid she's not gonna last very long.
I'm sorry. None of this should have happened.
the deal should have gone through weeks ago, then everything just got out of hand.
you knew.
you knew what we were putting out there could
you killed Coach Tappon.
is it warm in here or am I wearing 38 snuggies?
those boys only died because they drank too much.
it was never safe.
you just thought you could get away before anyone noticed.
I didn't know how it worked.
how long does she have?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
based on how quickly she's reacting,
I'd guess an hour, maybe two.
we have to act quickly.
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt by this.
what do we do?
amino acids.
the amino acids may have made contact with the metal and amped up the powers of the original ladle.
I did a lot of research on the subject of amino acids for Dr. Moreau.
let me have a look.
perhaps I can cobble together an antidote.
but that was 115 years ago.
I doubt amino acids have changed a great deal since then.
Hey!
you're going to take Agent Wells to your lab and you are going to assist her now.
I didn't want any of this.
then this is your lucky day, Gerald.
because we're giving you a chance to get it all sorted.
come on.
okay, I need something that slows down the burning process.
I'll put something together. - Okay.
any change?
no, she's burning up.
I'm fighting a losing battle.
she doesn't have much time.
I hope you have something.
I hope so too.
Claudia, I'm afraid this won't taste very good.
I know one mission won't change your mind.
I'm not expecting miracles overnight.
just keep an open mind.
Hey, you.
how do you feel?
did I combust? - No.
if that guy made me combust, I'm gonna be pissed.
Oh, thank God. Here, let's just set you up.
that's easy for u to say.
okay?
you should really thank H. G.
keep IT YOU CAN OWE ME.
U were being wheeled out
okay, I don't care if I'm having a brain transplant!
if you cross paths with H. G. Wells, you yank me out of anesthesia and you fill me in.
is that understood?
I'm really glad she showed up.
she saved my life. - Mine too.
Yeah, well, MacPherson saved my life countless times.
it didn't change who he was.
is that understood?
Yes, sir. - Crystal clear.
Artie, are you
good work on the ladle.
Yeah, yeah.
and I think I'm gonna go to bed.
apparently falling into a vat of bubbling poison kind of takes it out of you.
uh, Claudia, wait. I have something for you.
college admissions for South Dakota University.
there's some online courses in there too.
so why the parental shove?
well, you need a college degree to apply for the Secret Service.
right. Right.
okay.
um...Thanks for being so hard on me out there.
turns out, you can take it.
so I'm gonna go back to the Warehouse. Do you want to come?
no, no, no. I, uh--I got a date with...
Kelly possibly. Yeah.
Oh, I thought she turned you down.
Oh, no, no, no. She did. She did.
I just figured, you know, sometimes people can surprise you.
Yeah, I guess sometimes they do.
you should be resting.
this is resting for me.
okay, I rush all the way back to remove an appendix from my favorite patient, but apparently he did start without me.
Mmm, yeah, and I'm taking a long time to recover without you too.
not if you work your meridians.
I know. I'll tap all of the meridians and even the ticklish ones.
you can have the next one. I promise.
Oh, thank you. That's
I'm honored.
well, until next year then.
I've been thinking that, uh, you know, sometimes...
I can be kind of obnoxious in a really fun and entertaining way and since it's already come up, you did mention that I was cute.
although now that I think about it, bunny rabbits and kittens are cute, so maybe it wasn't he compliment that I thought it was.
look, I'm just heading into town.
do you want to come with me for a little walk or a sit?
Yeah, I'd like that.
good.
but I'll drive.
Yeah, you better.
but here's the thing.
I like you when you're not being really unnecessarily mean to me.
and I need to eat, you know, and I figured, I don't know, your species probably occasionally eats too.
so maybe the two of us could sit down at the same table together and both eat.
fine.
eating at the same table...
but nothing more and don't get any ideas.
I almost never do.
chinese place on main and we're going dutch.
couldn't we go to the Dutch place on Fifth and go Chinese?
come on, slappy, before I change my mind.
Hey, so when you said I was cute, did you mean, like, kitten, bunny rabbits cute or
we haven't met. I'm Mrs. Frederic.
warehouse 13... Is it yours?
it's mine... And so are Lattimer and Bering.
excuse me?
Kate Logan, Chicago Field Office.
I didn't know you transferred to Chicago.
so, uh, you showing up here mean I should call you, right?
call, don't call-- same as always.
I'm so sorry we got cut off earlier. S-something huge came up.
I don't think it's a good idea for me to see you anymore.
turn around and put your hands in the air!
H. G. Wells. - That's my daughter...My Christina.
everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now, except the Warehouse.
I want to come back and work there again.
okay, I don't care if I'm having a brain transplant.
if you cross paths with H. G. Wells, yank me out of anesthesia, and you fill me in.
is that understood?
Yes, sir. - Crystal clear.
stop!
for God's sake
I told you I've got a bad shoulder, okay?
it's an old wrestling injury.
71. He bowled a 71.
it's amazing to me that you're single. Really, so surprising.
it broke. - What? What? What broke?
she knows. - Just some dumb shelf.
is there a reason Warehouse shelves are falling down?
Yes. We need brackets.
from the hardware store.
well, I'm usually pretty good at mysteries. This one's got me stumped.
Yeah, me too.
Todd works at the hardware store.
Oh! Yes, yes.
Todd, the young lad with the glasses--the boyfriend.
not anymore. - They broke up.
she's trying not to run into him, so she won't go to the hardware store - to get the brackets-- I don't care about Todd.
she doesn't care about Todd. What a coincidence.
and we've got work to do.
Yes, let's all grow up a little, shall we?
Oh, snap!
Kate Logan. Excuse me.
Yeah.
just can't get enough of me, can you? Well, who can blame you?
what?
Pete, what's wrong?
it's Dickinson. Somebody
guys...
we have to go to Washington, D.C. right now.
do they know the cause of death?
massive internal bleeding and hypovolemic shock.
this is an X-ray of Dickinson's hand.
it looks like every bone has been dislocated.
Yeah, the carpals usually sit right against the radius, but there's a half an inch between them.
every joint in his body looks like that, as if he was pulled apart.
my God.
what the hell could have done this?
the only word for it is "freaky.
that's why I called you.
that's what you do, right? Weird and freaky.
the pain-- it just must have been...
would you give us a minute?
right. Super-secret weird and freaky.
I'll be outside.
I just-- I can't believe this. Why?
I don't care what it takes, but we are not going to stop till we know who's responsible for this.
Pete...It's me.
this is my fault.
Artie, what do you mean this is your fault? How can this be your fault?
Artie, just-- just talk to us. What did this?
you wouldn't have thought it was anything
just an old, rusty chain.
what chain?
the rack the chain from Torquemada's rack.
what? Who is this Torquemada woman?
a different rack entirely.
Tomas de Torquemada
the Grand Inquisitor-- he was the driving force behind the Spanish Inquisition.
if the holder pulls the chain taut and focuses his energy on the victim, then it induces the same kind of bone-wrenching agony...
that was suffered on the rack.
that's why Dickinson's bones were all...
twisted and wrenched from their sockets.
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.
Artie, I just don't understand. How is this your fault?
well...
in the '70s, I had some dealings with the Soviet Union.
no, no, no. Artie, we know all that.
okay, pre-Warehouse, you worked for the NSA.
you traded secrets to the Russians. They were going charge you with treason.
but Mrs. Frederic fixed it.
you didn't trade secrets...
did you?
artifacts?
just trinkets.
I thought that they were antiques, old relics that the Soviets were willing to trade for.
what, wait, trade-- trade what--money?
no.
political prisoners rotting in the Gulags.
you traded artifacts... For people?
it was a different world, Myka.
berlin Wall...
nuclear stockpiling, persecution of Soviet Jews.
what was a rusty old chain compared to a human life?
I didn't know it was an artifact.
Hey, man...
I'd have done the same thing.
and then, one day, my Russian contact let slip that these old trinkets...
had power.
and pretty soon, I discovered that many of these things had frightening, dangerous power - and I couldn't live with the guilt, so I-- so you turned yourself in.
and that was the day Mrs. Frederic came into my life.
she made me an offer, a chance to make amends for past mistakes.
that's why she gave you a new name.
Arthur Weisfelt died that day, and Artie Nielsen was born.
look, that's a hell of a story, Artie, but what's it got to do with Dickinson? Why him?
I don't know.
but we are going to find out.
...Glory is yours, forever and ever.
Amen.
Amen.
I'm just gonna take a walk.
okay.
is she okay?
as okay as you can be at a friend's funeral.
it's a bloody rotten business.
what are you doing here?
same as you-- tracking Torquemada's chain.
it was on our most-desired list in Warehouse 12.
well, you know what? You are actually on Artie's most-desired list.
so unless you want to be bronzed again
he's still opposed to my returning as an Agent?
well, he's opposed to your existence.
so, yeah, I would say that extends to you-- this is absurd.
I saved your life. I saved Claudia's life.
I've--I've proven I can be trusted.
more than not, I've proven that I'm of value.
I'm not questioning your value.
I'm curious about your motives.
Myka, I can't.
I don't belong in this world.
the Warehouse is
I'm gonna need more than that.
I'm gonna need more than...
she doesn't like the world.
I need the truth.
why did they bronze you?
What--what did you do that the Regents felt that they had to encase you in
I asked to be bronzed.
you asked?
you...
who in their right mind would
I wasn't in my right mind.
my daughter, my Christina, had been murdered
a senseless crime, brutal and senseless.
I had to try to...
to change it.
and I was working in a place where miracles happen.
there had to be something, some way to bring her back or to turn back time.
I spent years desperately combing the shelves of Warehouse 12.
twice I was discovered and brought before the Regents.
twice they were lenient and gave me a reprieve.
the third time...
my recklessness cost the life of a fellow Agent.
I was distraught and quite mad, I'm afraid.
I had become a danger.
so I asked, and they said yes.
I suppose I hoped to awaken in a different world, a better one.
the bronzer was your time machine.
closest I could come.
I'll talk to Artie.
thank you.
um, this is how to reach me in D. C.
I'm sorry about your friend.
Ah, we sure missed you when you left the NSA.
beauty and brains.
Thanks, Joe.
Oh, it turns out that I found my calling.
Oh, do I want to know what that means?
no, no. Never mind. I don't.
as long as you love what you're doing, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
right.
uh, thanks, but I'm really not hungry.
I made tuna melts.
tuna melts? Okay, you buried the lead.
I'm standing in front of a dead woman.
you two have to live in the same town.
work it out.
I'll go get some lemonade.
if Claudia won't come to the hardware store...
the hardware store will come to Claudia?
cute.
Ooh, brackets.
you shouldn't have.
Yeah, so...
so...
how's life? Good?
if by "good" you mean excruciatingly boring, then, yeah, my life's good.
Yeah, mine's really good.
I've been thinking about you.
Ironic-- you broke up with me.
I know.
I guess I just didn't think you'd cut out of my life completely.
I can do black. I can do white.
not so good with gray.
you mix black paint with white paint.
you've got to get out of that hardware store, at least to find some new metaphors.
so does that mean we could maybe be friends?
friends...
sounds grayish.
the thing is, Claudia...
I got to go.
I'm--I'm sorry, I-- you're leaving?
I-I'll call you later, I promise.
I'm--I'm really sorry. I-I promise I-I'll call you.
what happened?
I have no fracking idea.
dude was here, got a text, dude is gone.
well, men are generally out of touch with their emotions.
I mean, look at Pete and Artie. Those are my choices?
they say one thing, and they do another, because they're not exactly sure how they feel.
mixed signals cover all possibilities.
exactly.
how am I supposed to respond to that, Leena, with a big smile or with gunfire?
with patience. Give him time.
patience?
right.
Oh, no, I can be patient.
actually, no, I can't.
Sanchez, are you backing from lunch already?
could you-- who are you?
how did you get in here?
Pete's just looking through the rest of the security-camera footage.
this is where you found him? It was quick and quiet.
people in the other offices didn't hear a thing.
Artie, it-- it's 70 degrees here, but--but the prelim says that he died of hypothermia.
did--did the chain also...?
the Titanic.
there was a piece of driftwood.
it was pried from the arms of one of the victims.
it became imbued with...
certain properties. Another one you traded?
the coincidence doesn't escape me either.
if someone wanted Joe dead, then NSA headquarters is not the easiest place to take him out.
I think whatever they were after was right here.
and I want to know what.
you're never gonna get in.
the NSA's system is so much tighter than ours
I'm in.
I'm surprised it took you that long.
maybe I shouldn't be here while you hack NSA files.
well, the mainframe was not accessed, so whatever they were looking for was only in this computer...
here.
and the last file accessed was...
it's just a list of Russian names and addresses.
what?
Artie, what's the connection?
me.
these are names of people that I got released from the Gulag.
it's a list of my relatives.
these people are your family?
Hey, guys, so I went through the internal security feed.
there's something you're gonna want to see.
okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, right there.
H. G. Wells-- what is she doing now?
and why is she coming after me?
look, maybe she was here for other reasons.
like what? Applying for a job?
no, like hunting down whatever artifact that did this, so she can prove herself and rejoin the Warehouse.
Myka, how do you know that?
I...
may have...
spoken to her.
Oh, man!
you've been talking to H. G? Let me understand this.
you spoke to H. G. Wells about official Warehouse 13 matters, and you didn't tell me?
I was waiting for the right time.
this isn't it. You, of all people
you accuse me of keeping secrets, and then you go and do something like this?
no, hey. You know what, Artie?
no, no, no. This is good.
this is good, because, uh, now we have a lead.
and--and we know that H. G. is involved, and all we have to do is find her, and--and thank God that Myka is so good at that.
I know where she is-- the, um, Archer Hotel.
I guess we're going. Yeah.
all right.
all right, Claude, you can do this.
just walk up to him and say
and I'm officially stalking him. Okay.
well, who's the girl?
her name's Claudia. Claudia?
Yeah. What does she do?
she just works at a Warehouse.
that's all you know? An I. R.S. Warehouse.
Zoinks!
Ah, took you long enough.
finally looked at the envelope, did you?
Torquemada's chain-- where is it?
well, I don't have it.
I've been looking for it since 1894.
I'm trying to help you, Artie.
how do we know you didn't kill Dickinson or Joe Sweetwood?
what possible reason would have?
hadn't you rather be looking for the person who was photographing Artie at Dickinson's funeral?
photographing me?
I followed him, but by the time I got inside the NSA, it was too late.
he left something on Mr. Sweetwood's body.
I imagine it has significance to you.
what? What was it?
I'm more than happy to share my information, but I expect a little quid pro quo.
nothing.
I tell you nothing.
right.
good luck, then.
Artie, wait. Maybe she has some information
no, she is a killer, and she belongs in the bronze sector.
you don't know that! And I will not be blackmailed!
it's a lead. Artie, we need leads.
all right.
what is it?
in the bible on the nightstand.
what does it mean?
he's calling me out.
who?
it's my Soviet contact.
whenever he wanted to meet, he would leave a King of Hearts.
but I thought he was in prison.
Yeah, well, looks like he's out...
and obviously not for good behavior.
he went after Dickinson, because Dickinson knew that Arthur Weisfelt had become Artie Nielsen.
by killing Joe, this guy gets the list of all your relatives in Russia.
he's going after your family.
that's all the quid pro quo you're gonna get.
this guy must want you to know what he's doing.
but why?
Artie, why was Alexander sent to prison?
when I turned myself in, he became useless to his government.
he was a liability.
by the time I found that out...
it was too late.
so, revenge?
I have to get to Moscow.
no, Artie, that's exactly what he wants.
he's coming after my family.
we're going too. It's too dangerous.
Oh, don't even bother.
Weisfelt instruments.
Yeah.
it's quite the family resemblance.
and he teaches music, just like my father.
why don't you go in and say hello?
no, no.
that would put him in even more danger.
we've never met.
the family thinks that Arthur Weisfelt's dead.
it should stay that way.
man, this is a huge list.
was your whole family tree subversive?
well, no.
I had several cousins who were refused.
those days, when one was grabbed, whole family was grabbed.
so how are we supposed to warn and protect everyone
we're not.
we're gonna find Alexander first.
I got it.
we find the bastard, and then we go in guns blazing.
we're not gonna do any blazing.
we're gonna keep a low profile.
this visit is not exactly government sanctioned.
so no help from the local authorities and no diplomatic immunity.
none. What could they do to us?
you two
they yell at you, and they send you home.
and what about you?
I didn't change my name to hide from our government.
as far as the Russians are concerned,
I'm a spy who betrayed them, so...
see, that's something you could've brought up on the plane.
this is the safe house where...
alexander and I used to meet.
alexander was a creature of habit.
if he's not here now, he will be soon.
well, finally we're one step ahead of this guy.
he's on the roof. - Son of a bitch.
grenade!
no.
croquet ball.
croquet ball.
Oh, God.
if he's got the other one...
get down!
down!
all right, stay down. Stay down!
what, is this another old friend of yours, Artie?
Yeah, it's Charles II's croquet ball, imbued with the fury of a King and a sore loser.
Oh, interesting sidebar-- later!
so how do we stop it? We don't!
it's got to stop on its own. It could take hours.
the ball is lethal! Stay out of its way!
okay, I think I can make it to the door and then see if I can spot him.
Artie, be careful!
Pete, get down!
Oh-ho. Bye-bye.
Myka, do you think you can get to the old fridge?
what, are you hungry now?
just be prepared to open it, okay?
right. Okay. Okay.
ready?
one...
two...
go!
Pete, behind you!
little league, don't fail me now!
Wakah! - Pete...
Artie's outside.
well, this isn't good. You getting a vibe?
don't need one.
Yeah, I'm here.
who are the... Fighting Ocelots?
Claude, you have a post-it kind of stuck on your...
Hey, you find any info on Alexander?
we've run into a real dead end here.
uh, I pulled an all-nighter digging for intel.
and... Nada.
the Soviets must have disappeared him.
I'm running some needle-in-a-haystack programs right now, but I'm gonna need a little more info.
could you put Artie on a sec?
can't. He's-- Artie got hungry, and he went out for some borscht.
just, uh, get back to us.
there's no use in panicking Claudia.
I mean, there's not much she can do from there.
there's not much we can do from here.
and now I want borscht.
Wow. Is that all on Alexander?
this is on Alexander.
this is on Todd.
and I'm not stalking him.
but look at this picture I took of him.
look at that. See the guy he's talking to?
he's totally packing heat...
in Univille.
I mean, I saw that, I figured...
maybe I should dig a little deeper.
school records, tax--dental records.
Claudia, that's a little stalker-y.
what did you find out?
nothing, until you get behind the data.
all of this info was entered on the same day six months ago, right before Todd showed up in our sleepy, little hamlet.
Leena, what if Todd is trying to use me to get into the Warehouse?
I think I should go to town and
no, you should stay away from him until Artie gets back.
you're right.
you're right. That's exactly what I was thinking.
guess I'll just, uh, figure out which shelf to put this thing on.
I'll do that. I'll do it. I'll do it.
okay.
too easy.
Claudiola-- I was just thinking about you.
settle a bet for Pete and me.
he thinks there's no High School with an Ocelot mascot, but I thought you said your high-school football team had one, right?
did we talk about this?
Yeah, the Fighting Ocelots.
I knew it! The undefeated Ocelots.
pride and Joy of my youth.
listen, I was thinking.
we should totally be friends and hang out.
nice segue. How about Friday?
how about now? - Sounds good.
pond in the park in, say, 45?
make it 40. Great.
okay, we can't go to the local police, and we certainly can't go to the government.
we don't know how to call Mrs. Frederic.
well, all right, what about
hold it.
what?
what?
what is this? What is
Ah, for crying out loud.
I think someone's watching us.
why don't you just say that?
cause I'm trying to act nonchalant.
Oh, good job.
all right.
so, um, I still want you to go that way.
okay?
and then I'm gonna go-- I'm gonna go this way.
okay. Take the bag, okay?
we'll see who he follows. Okay.
all right, babe. - Well, I'll see you later.
I'll see you at dinner. Give me some sag
just go with it. All right.
was that really necessary?
Hey, you.
you mind telling me what you're doing here?
you remember me?
we really don't have time for this.
how did you find us?
Receiver-- tells me the exact coordinates of the transmitter I slipped into Myka's pocket at the cemetery, and before you get angry
I'm not angry.
just tell me you also slipped one of those into Artie's pocket too.
Artie's gone?
he was kidnapped.
probably by the same person who killed Dickinson and Sweetwood.
we could use your help. - Wait, Myka, no.
Artie would blow a gasket.
Pete, we need help, and she's here.
and for the record, I knew，that you slipped this in my pocket at the cemetery.
I-I thought you'd know.- I knew you'd think that.
Oh, all right.
look, we think he might have been taken by his former Soviet contact.
that's impossible. How do you know that?
it couldn't have been Alexander.
that's why Claudia's trail ran cold.
you mind filling me in here?
alexander died 13 years ago.
it's you, isn't it?
Why? Some kind of revenge?
Alexander, listen...
what we did...
was wrong.
the artifacts were dangerous.
they needed to be locked away.
that's why I turned myself in.
I didn't know that they would punish you.
save your breath.
you'll need it.
who the hell are you?
the last person you'll ever see.
the man I spend my entire life hating.
Oh, my God.
you look just like...
it's Ivan, right? Ivan.
you're Alexander's son.
no.
to be a son, you would need a father.
mine spent his entire life in prison because of you.
not me-- your government did that.
you caused it.
they gave you a new life...
while my father died in a cell.
now it's your turn.
do you really think we should be going through Artie's bag?
Yes, Pete! Of course!
unless you have a better idea! Okay, okay.
two Mykas-- this is gonna be fun.
Hey, a compass--maybe this is some sort of homing device that always points at Artie.
no, no, that would be too easy.
holy crap! W-what does that do?
it holds Artie's glasses.
right, so I can understand your excitement.
but Artie always loses his glasses, which is why Claudia rigged them so he could always find them!
is this the receiver? - No, he lost that week's go. But...
I know someone who has one. - Good job!
you made it. Of course. I said I would.
people say a lot of things. They do, they do.
Hey, you don't drive an old el Camino, do you?
me? No, it's Artie's, actually. I hardly ever...
Ah, screw it.
what the hell is that?
I'm asking the questions here, starting with who the hell are you?
me? - You don't exist.
you're six months old.
why were you spying on me? - I figured you out, man.
think you can use me to get into the Warehouse?
what do I care about an I. R.S. Warehouse?
bet you're just as bad as MacPherson.
you just want to-- wait, what?
who's MacPherson?
you think it's an I. R.S. Warehouse?
isn't it? Or ha! Is that just your cover, working for John Conti?
John Conti? Who the hell's jo
wait, John Conti, the mobster?
dude, I don't work for him.
then what the hell is going on?
Oh, Todd, you're in trouble.
trying hard not to be.
was the Marshal right? Am I a dead man?
no, no, of course not. You're...
Jinkies.
you're in the Witness Protection program, aren't you?
man, you didn't know? - No, I thought...
man, how the hell's you get yourself into the program?
I was just an I. T. guy Conti hired to recover a hard drive.
I saw some files I wasn't supposed to, and all of a sudden,
I'm living in this weird town in South Dakota.
I-I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't.
and that--that guy I saw you with was
my handler. He's pretty pissed at me right now.
I wasn't supposed to get close to anybody, let alone fall in love with them.
wait a second. Back that up.
okay. "Love" is a really strong word.
no, no, no. Further back.
you mean you really are a techie after all?
monster.
dude.
the light is flashing. He should be right here.
I guess he was.
this way.
Oh, my God.
you've got the jacks.
so killing those men and the list of my family, that was for what
just to--to-- to get me here?
Ivan, no.
Don't--don't-- don't use that.
it doesn't just affect victims.
whoever uses it, it--it--it infects your soul, steals your humanity.
and the longer you have it, the more like Torquemada you become.
good.
that will make this easier.
okay, where now?
you guys take this corridor. I'll go this way.
just help me with this door.
why don't you just yell,"here we come"?
Hey!
be careful.
Hey! What?
come on.
Oh, come on! There's got to be another way.
what?
what? It's okay.
what are you?
don't, no.
Shh. Behind you.
it's okay.
y-you don't need to do this.
it takes a few minutes.
I want to watch you watch your friend die.
let her die. I don't care.
she means nothing to me.
this woman who risks her life to save yours?
I see it's still very hazardous to be your friend.
there's no time. - What are you doing?
Oh, jeez.
let's see what this thing does.
okay. And...Go!
And...Activate! Fire! Come on!
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! It's a reflex hammer, right?
sure. Okay, well...
now, that's cool. Let's go. - Yeah.
Why?
Ivan, why? What's the point?
what are you gonna do? You just gonna kill people who have absolutely nothing to do with this?
don't worry. Don't worry. Her death will be quick.
not yours.
take this. Hold this tight.
it's the only thing that'll reverse it.
hold it tight!
you'll be all right.
you all right?
Yeah, yeah. That was a good shot, by the way, unless you were shooting at Ivan.
if I'd shot him, you'd still be chained there.
and I would have frozen to death.
that was some good thinking.
you'll be all right. You'll be all right.
well, that wasn't so hard.
say it again.
Oh, come on. Please? For me.
my preferred method of hacking is to use an integrated secure toolkit applied a safe-type concurrent algorithm derived from an active binary work cluster embedded in a synchronized met level high-speed architecture.
I love it when you talk tech.
he's gonna be here soon.
this sucks.
we can finally talk.
I finally feel like I'm getting to know you.
suckity, suckity, suck, suck, suck.
sorry, my handlers are just too freaked.
they think I'll be safer someplace else.
but, hey, if I live to testify,
I'll come back.
Oh, that's an interesting brush-off.
I could always just send Conti into an interdimensional space.
what's that?
tell you later? - Not fair.
time to go.
you know I'll find you.
you better.
how could you?
you turned her in.
you handed her over to the Regents without even considering that she might be - a valuable asset and-- Myka.
what makes you think that this was his decision,
agent Bering?
you seriously believe that there's not a thorough and complete vetting process by which the agents of Warehouse 13 are selected?
Mrs. Frederic recommends.
regents discuss.
and I make the final decision.
so who's this guy now?
Mr. Kosan, Agent Lattimer, Agent Bering.
Adwin Kosan is...
on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.
you make the decisions.
some of them.
Yes.
we have to trust that Mr. Kosan will make the right choice.
the choice has been made.
has she been bronzed, then?
ms. Wells?
this is thanks in no small part to Agent Bering's report.
to Agent Bering's re-- I tried to tell you, but
in conjunction with our findings,
H. G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse Agent.
she's convinced the Regents that she's no longer a threat, but an asset.
welcome home, Agent Wells.
thank you, sir.
agent Wells.
Reinstated?
be it ever so humble.
thank you.
without you, I wouldn't be here.
well, I would, but I'd be in bronze.
welcome to the team, I guess, yeah?
thank you.
no.
this is wrong.
Artie... - This is wrong!
Artie! Wait!
Artie, wait!
Artie, don't you dare just walk away.
we went to Russia so we could right the wrongs from your past.
don't you think that H. G. deserves the same chance?
you're saying that she's just like me?
you're wrong. She's nothing like me!
and no matter how much good she's done for all of us,
I'll never trust that woman.
but if the Regents are sure, don't you think you should
Oh, now you want to know what I think.
I think I'm gonna regret not letting her freeze to death.
but by then, it'll be too late...
for all of us.
she's in shock.
twins.
as a Warehouse Agent.
what?
Pete,
Pete.
Lattimer.
or not.
and I don't know what,
nothing!
stop.
just like you u lost Christina?
Hey.
right. - Get it.
Kelly?
it's simple.
okay.
Artie.
a hatch! Whoo!
millions would die immediately,
what are you doing there?
why would I do that?
cut it out.
No!
okay.
no, nothing has been decided
with you.
right, hey.
do it.
Yeah.
Pete, don't...
you are.
Oh, big time.
Myka. - What?
come on, get up. We gotta go.
Pete, where am I?
and always comes at a price.
all right.
what?
Artie,
nothing?
watch me.
come on.
with what? What is that?
Yes.
what's that for?
Myka.
Oh, mon dieu.
Pete!
Yeah.
it is.
let's face it,
it must be the knife.
No!
but I'm quite baffled that
and no matter how much good
do it!
well, she obviously wanted an artifact,
Oh, I know this one.
it's okay.
egypt, Warehouse 2,
come on out.
I can track her with this.
Complic...
Kelly?
we have to.
Hey.
not this, this.
I'm sorry.
innocent?
I do.
and we are in big trouble.
ha, even I know that one.
but she said...
how can she spot what's missing?
you don't need me.
the less you know,
what?
stop!
Really?
all right then.
hang on a sec, Pete.
Where's she gonna go, of Warehouse 2?
I love you.
texted them.
Pete, would you mind...
they land at de Gaulle any minute.
I can give you the address.
okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
like arrows.
my God.
Myka.
kill me.
Oh, of course.
you know, this is kinda cool.
Myka!
Ugh, Kelly, I'm...
no, no, no, no.
when I got here, I reset the frequency.
it's empty. He's gone.
it was a piece of cake.
warehouse 2 is back online.
all right.
big bump.
then you disappear.
with a pitchfork and a toga.
because I love him.
I'm leaving.
she's done for all of us,
Oh, don't worry.
in a bit.
look, um, Kelly,
with all my heart.
Oh, what? - Come on!
well, it wouldn't be up there if there wasn't a way to get to it.
no, I'm sorry, scratch that.
got her. - Where is she?
big surprise.
once I lock in on her signal,
did somebody send you that ax?
right. - Right?
the place is filled with sand, Artie.
we know!
okay, stop, stop. You ready?
but when I lost the signal
she just bought a ticket from Cairo to de Gaulle.
I knew you were in trouble.
it's...
and go.
I wouldn't.
watch over them,
Pete.
no kidding.
the Yellowstone caldera.
you never wanted this.
Yellowstone.
Monsieur Sempe, you mind waiting outside?
and I'll make sure of that.
we have to get to Kelly.
now what do you want?
or in Paris.
okay, okay, wait.
she can't be.
he was about to tell us.
you saved us all.
Myka.
I get the whole anger thing, - Myka, come on. - Pete?
she went to the main floor.
into finding us a way outta here?
but which one?
hang back there, Pointer Sister.
you coming?
you don't think that...
voila, monsieur.
there's got to be something here.
Where's the cemetery?
Paris.
meaningful.
it's stuck.
that she used on us...
Pete, look, a hatch! - What?
I played him in the fifth grade
Oh, I'll kill her.
okay, well, I'm sorry to interrupt you
he was the father of... Icarus.
to get in there.
good luck. - Yeah.
we'll get there ahead of her. Go, go, go.
what's up?
give me that.
open your eyes, Myka.
kill me now.
in which she was ultimately found?
okay, okay.
but could you please just channel it
when Pete and Myka were in 1961,
fort lauderdale.
do it!
Pete sent it to me.
let go of me!
she's not stationary. She's moving.
wait, Kelly.
and this...
I know. I got one to match.
or that's where Christina is buried.
where?
rack of Spears. One is missing.
Artie?
okay, no.
she wants to bring her daughter back from the dead?
she's gone.
three times.
well, what, are you calling
why would you say that?
already happening. - We put a trace on both
what do you mean nothing?
I won't.
show me...Are you messing around
so what,
can we get there in time?
laboratory? No.
Yeah, they're designed to work deep underground,
did MacPherson know that somehow?
so not as good, but...
cause we got a bad guy to catch.
and the other half of the trident.
it must be working again.
I don't know what it is,
do we think that H. G. is doing the same thing?
Artie. - Hi.
we don't know where she is, but...
can you describe the area
sorry, sorry.
Yes.
it's gonna take months to dig out.
thank you, sir.
for such a mediocre kisser,
compact!
I do hate voicemail.
just stand still.
makes you kill the one you love, - Right here? - Yeah.
right?
not that I remember.
so we need to find Warehouse 2
you promise?
to fund those students.
I'm...I'm terribly sorry.
I love it when you talk dirty.
but I can't get it out of my head.
what?
well, hike up your skirt,
okay, come on, baby.
with stuff in the Farnsworth aisle?
that you would go to these lengths?
would you...
Larry? Lizzie?
Yeah, well, I bet wagging your finger if I could find a way to travel through time
there's a lot less to lick now, but then I am me.
Yeah, look at Mickey Rourke.
look.
what in the hell was that?
now I assume that Warehouse 2
to my specifications.
run a trace on Pete's phone.
four words.
Oh, babe.
Oh, God.
but I'll always love you.
even by fiction writers.
I needed you to trust me.
Oh, come on.
good-bye, Pete.
I'm afraid so.
I'm going to have to kill you.
Yeah, but she needed experienced agents
rack of Spears.
H. G.'s probably already here.
okay, I said it.
I'm gonna kill her!
Oh, but I do.
help me.
Bingo! - Right.
Yep, she's dead.
what's new here, Kel?
so then what?
all right, just...just listen, okay?
what's up?
I've been really busy at work,
I mean, we're all gonna die anyway, right?
it's not that complicated.
she hacked into the Warehouse account
you're the one that eats like a bird.
you mean that?
the Minoan Trident.
Yes.
of H. G.'s last position.
that's why she killed him.
show me.
it's the whole freaking Sahara Desert.
Pete, good, you're together.
I'm still tracking H. G.'S access to funds.
and I can't stay here.
you expect to do anything about it.
Oh, good, you've landed.
what's going on?
is that right?
let go of me!
is there a chapter on flying?
no, no, Kelly, look, I...
Yeah, but we don't even know how it works.
don't be rude.
beat out Ralph Brunskie for that part.
Caesar wanted that power.
to where?
it's the Thera Volcano,
there was...there was vases.
according to Claudia, the Cimetiere du Rennes exactly where Christina's buried.
Artie, listen, I'm really sorry.
but I found Christina's gravesite.
so shoot me.
bigger than millions would die?
you love me, and I love you.
I did a term paper on her.
why am I having these headaches?
what about the millions of mothers
she's taking a car. We'll take a chopper.
what are you doing?
something that protects the artifacts.
Yeah!
close your eyes.
I don't know about Spears, but I can tell you resurrection is a dangerous practice
we know!
she's just that good?
I'm grateful she's been taken care of
judging from the depth of her preparation,
I don't think you believe that.
okay, Lizzie Borden's compact
Artie, what is it?
no, don't.
you can't blame yourself.
if you had wanted to do that,
she fooled us all.
then things would have improved,
the Thera eruption was thought to have been caused we got a lot to talk about.
turn around. - What, why me?
I realized that H. G. had jammed it.
Yes, I even said it first.
don't just flap there.
I know it in my soul.
this is a subterranean heat sensor.
but you didn't.
a utopia would have emerged,
this means that you love me.
chopping Pete up into little bits.
stay safe.
but there's a far greater problem.
Hiya, Kelly.
what's the Minoan Trident?
Claudia, you try to find out - What's that sound? - That's sand.
Myka, that's two.
like arrows, all right.
someone has found the lost Warehouse.
if done in the right place,
Really? At a time like this?
trying to figure out where the key went, right?
I signed the papers.
so whatever you might have planned for me...
I've been quite impressed,
and here she is.
Artie, what is it?
but it's not about that.
look, Harvey.
Claudia, if you don't get out of my way,
Ah, it hurts when I shrug.
you don't think what? She can't be what?
gotta be an artifact.
that is exactly what I intend to do,
kinda got my hands full here.
Yeah, well, I put the team in danger
I'm so thirsty.
well, looking into the compact
Myka, you found a hatch. Yeah!
why Paris?
missing spear, labeled in any way?
let's hope so.
are you sure there was a handle?
egyptian endless wonder.
we must be high enough. Back pocket.
Ah, the hatch! - Yeah.
what? Okay. - Yeah.
you have no idea.
stop laughing!
or not. Pardon me, sir.
still really dead.
come on, come on.
Yellowstone caldera, which is under...
it should never have come to that.
okay. - Okay.
this may have begun with Christina's murder, 100 feet up there,
Myka.
what happened to you?
he didn't even say good-bye. - I know.
okay, okay. - Okay.
to?
many years ago.
all right, just watch your back.
no, don't you dare.
gorgeous.
then what?
Yes, and she discovered, somehow, the location
close your eyes?
what about a snake around a staff?
not even a very good one.
or...or a catapult or something.
not this time.
warehouse 2 is filling with sand.
H. G. told me her daughter was murdered in Paris.
but I can't even buy a wine cooler in this state,
when one of them got hurt,
so please don't tell me.
I don't normally do this.
I tried to kill you.
are you kidding me? People go there for vacation.
Artie, I can't stay here, I gotta go.
Lizzie Andrew Borden.
and danger, that were inconceivable in my day
for a time, I had a cognitive connection
H. G. she played us! She played me!
our Warehouse, right, there's a back door
actually no.
okay, these wings were probably designed by Daedalus.
Yeah, I foolishly believed that "I've thought a lot about this,
because it's getting kinda boring.
think, Helena.
I'd really rather you just give me the ax.
not quite catching me of course,
I have work to do.
and what could you possibly want
french lawyer.
I can't see.
the trident is real.
was here trying to save Mrs. Frederic,
here we come. Hold on.
and move, and fly.
the minute you get back.
all right, go on.
the Corsican Vest?
are you gonna die on us every year?
what's going on?
she has nothing to do with this.
your phones as soon as you got to Paris just in case.
so what's the difference?
cause we can make that happen for you.
we're partners, a team.
where did you find it, Venice?
to simplify my life, the very people who can stop you.
you would have already left.
inadvertently via the pearl.
wyoming, and not far, but... - What?
I am Poseidon.
what are you talking about?
I will do research on Spears.
well, Myka and I were in the office
that's only two hours away from here.
now that she's got both parts, like...like arrows.
happily.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
it could unleash a volcanic eruption.
I'm not surprised you found me.
triggered an Ice Age.
Oh, I haven't done a thing.
that doesn't sound good.
at me, old man, will be...
look at the little puppy.
not like a coward.
shoot me now.
isn't that a medical symbol?
or will be decided
Pete, do you hear that? That's the Farnsworth.
holy crap!
good, first time, shame on her.
and hid it on her daughter's casket.
okay, okay, look.
you had a lot of vibes about H. G. didn't you?
and that's a beautiful way to show it, but, um...
but not like that.
like she killed her dad.
God, you're a terrible liar.
and neither can you.
Paris, 1899.
let's look at that shape
good. You let Pete and Myka know?
good thing it started working again.
Oh, thank you.
quit your job, Pete.
all right, I'm gonna go see Artie.
and she chops you into little bits.
with her and a little puppy.
keeping up with me as you have.
and the most powerful of which is thought to be
God, I need some water.
and when the job was neatly done,
a seismic hazard map
I've got a map here.
all right, get back here right now.
they smell.
Kelly, hey. I was just gonna call you.
que sera.
so he could find Warehouse 2
full access? I don't understand.
and I mean a long...time.
the other felt it.
are you putting me down?
if you wanted to kill Pete and me, "Please be careful.
you're the big brother I never had.
don't let her do it three times.
I love you all, Myka.
Oh, my God.
don't worry, Claudia has his back.
you can do whatever you want.
was to resurrect her daughter,
you deserve it.
okay, I just...I've got this one more trip,
so how'd you find us?
I don't know, when H. G. bolted
okay, when Dr. Vanessa
which means there's an estate.
Yes.
Madame, please, I'm just a simple lawyer.
listen, you leave her the hell alone.
I wish I could be there to see you grow into some stuff for a shelter?
I'll never trust that woman.
and that's why I have to kill you.
stay away from me.
you would have done it at Warehouse 2
Uh-huh, right. And why?
Cimetiere du Rennes moved
that's what the Woolly Mammoths did.
don't really have time to explain what it does.
that's one of the reasons the Romans came to Egypt.
I love seeing you.
like arrows.
Yeah!
should be right around this corner.
and...and that part is still alive,
Oh, Pete.
babe, I love you too.
you talked her down.
I tried to kill Pete.
all right, hold on, I'll be right back.
the divide between rich and poor,
then she's come and gone already.
it breaks my heart to write this.
but I promise you it'll make your life so right back at you there, grandma.
that's the part that refuses to kill
I'm gonna keep dying until it takes,
reaches thousands of feet into the ground and...
you obviously know what you're holding.
I want you to look me in the eyes
Oh, I'm afraid not, dear boy.
Pete! Pete, over here!
I'm stuck.
about moving in together, and then...
this place is a labyrinth.
okay, so she's returning to the scene of the crime.
and estates have lawyers.
look.
Myka, listen, H. G. is a bad guy.
MacPherson was collecting artifacts
just...just cut it out!
look, she's powdering his nose.
it's just that your life
what are you, uh, putting together
well, go ahead, get nice and comfy.
Hey, Kelly, Kelly, it's all right.
look, you need to forget about that.
when MacPherson was part of your consciousness...
you are so filled with grief and anger, zap the crazy right out of you?
Myka, talk to her. Talk to her.
so...
Peter...
to sell them to the highest bidder.
whoo, man, you have got to let me keep these.
she took something, something that's missing.
the wings of Daedalus. Good call.
MacPherson must have left an image of it
okay.
no, no, something...
Pete, close your eyes!
look, I'm so sorry.
you and I are going to Yellowstone.
I love you, Pete.
Lizzie. Lizzie Borden! Woot!
all flourishing beyond control.
listen, Kelly, somebody did something to you, a whole lot easier.
she didn't fool Artie.
I'm sure she'll be crazy for it.
Oh, my God.
the Minoan civilization was destroyed
the Minoan Trident was the first
if you want to visit Christina Wells' resting place,
someone evil just bought a plane ticket.
that's the last thing he's gonna say to us?
don't fight it, dude.
Yes, we can definitely use this.
we were just talking about you.
are you okay? - No, get me some water.
um, Pete, I...
good, boy. You did great, Harvey.
no, no, baby, baby.
and you're gonna wish you hadn't.
the better you'll be able to do your job.
and wondering if I should be calling hospitals.
the way we came in is history.
fading.
Hey, it's Kelly. You mind?
two days ago we had a vague conversation
up. Pete, up.
second time, I'm bringing that bitch down.
look, if H. G. shot her with the same gun
Bryson, Bryson Reservoir.
it could have happened to any one of us.
but here we are over a century later
so now are you just calling to brag
you were born for it.
Claudia, go back up Pete.
just give her a rest for a bit.
H. G. guess who just saved the day.
see, cause the truth is...
the handle.
now would be nice.
I thought, you know, handling some ancient Spears
the second I get back.
excuse me. Hi, uh, excuse me.
what is she planning to do with them?
she's gotta be right around here.
to get what she wants, and we're not.
somebody, I can't tell you who,
I mean, it's not even a tourist stop on the way to...
Really? No!
I've seen that shape before.
Artie, who are you, Jerusalem Jones?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
of her remains, right?
but just, please, you gotta trust me.
how about a little electroshock therapy,
but it didn't. It happened to me.
the trident was the first artifact locked away
sure, Pete, we've got nothing but time.
well, I went between that
what? I just bought this.
what about...
Pete, H. G. she ran down there.
and shut it down.
okay, just keep searching the shelves, okay?
you can do whatever you want in here.
give her head time to catch up.
Oh, hey, Lady Koo-Koo.
breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe.
I our Warehouse, so there must be one here too.
much of its inventory was downloaded into my mind.
then she needed to arrange for the upkeep
can you imagine watching a Browns game like this?
I've been waiting for you.
she's on a road trip to see America?
would you give this to Artie, please?
looks like I-26, heading for Bryson Reservoir.
she's coming, she's coming here.
and Artie, you would have let him die in Russia,
what, money? Power?
okay, look, if H. G.'s plan while you're handling your ancient spear,
okay, if you can't see it, the ends have points,
I understand you wanted to see me.
Yeah, well, you taste about as old as you are,
you scared me to death. I thought...
that's why you called Pete this morning.
I know, I know, I know.
can I hug you? - Maybe later in the week.
so maybe Lizzie did it after all.
I'd have thought you'd at least have brains.
now we'll do this the easy way.
I am not the one, Pete.
you are lying to yourself.
Mrs. Frederic, do you see...
kid had a voice like Jennifer Tilly.
I can try. It's fading.
finally, listen, H. G.'s a bad guy.
will just be Mrs. Frederic.
what now?
you did that to yourself.
Artie, what's...what's happening?
but there is a part of you, I know it, "Please forgive me, but I have to go.
the rule is I can tell one person,
look, Artie, Valda's dead.
by destroying the parasites who are eating it alive.
you just need to sign whatever needs to be signed.
you wouldn't believe me anyway.
the only way to save this world is by Alexander the Great in what became Warehouse 1.
there's gotta be... there.
you control your own destiny.
you don't have to understand.
warehouse 13 needs you.
is filled with excitement,
so if you're not gonna
have you looked at the world in which you live?
to play a little game or let's make a deal?
she's willing to lie, steal, and kill
I don't know, get Kelly back.
okay, there's no way that any of us could be sure that...
tell Kelly that I love her. Tell her to...
Yeah, they generate their own lift.
well, yank it. Yank it hard.
Yeah, we always kind of thought we'd go out this way.
right, right. Poseidon had a trident.
this isn't a bargaining tool.
Claudia, you can't be here right now.
Kelly, are you back?
well, the vest, "I wish I had your strength.
I always thought it would be a little more, you know,
Casper/Natrona International, Wyoming.
one really important person, so...
or did you get a sudden craving to be bronzed again?
I've closed all my accounts and buried my trail.
Artie, something's fishy. Pete, won't answer his phone.
and just insanity, which created the Island of Santorini.
it's a long story. I had a sudden business trip.
and MacPherson debronzed her has been planning this for a long...
it's probably just a rug, Pete!
Oh, right, because they worked out so well for Icarus.
you know, you must think I'm the biggest jerk in the world.
Yeah, I bet that's exactly what Daedalus had in mind.
I pinpointed the coordinates on your Farnsworth.
the magma chamber is highest here.
I wasn't counting "Pete.
indeed men have found new ways to kill each other who are gonna lose their daughters start another Ice Age.
okay, you're my happiest place on earth.
she sent me some pictures...
she gave her mother 41.
and things have actually gotten worse.
wait, I don't understand.
and preventing a worldwide disaster.
may I leave now?
it seems obvious to me that H. G. Wells
a weapon of mass destruction.
something is wrong.
without your complete consent.
maybe the spear has resurrection properties.
I just know that I can't...
this is no world for a child.
look, I trust your instincts, Mykes.
so because you lost your daughter, because you're angry
so I'm gonna side with us on this one.
of the six known supervolcanoes in the world,
I don't want to go all around Paris shooting people.
Kelly, it's way more simple than it looks.
and then maybe I'll let you live.
and then I'm yours completely.
I'm sorry.
Artie, this is progress, right?
it needs a chance to repair itself.
well, it's under Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana.
no, no, no, no, she's just trying to distract us.
look, just because that worked on H. G. doesn't...
I know that I might talk big sometimes, Artie,
what is it?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, kiddo.
and why is Pete tied to my table?
no, not really.
will it make me feel old and uncomfortable?
you both did excellent work retrieving that artifact
it looks like things are okay between me and Kelly.
in the 15th Century B. C.E.
you will live the life that you want,
Yeah, the question is,
Mrs. Frederic, you...
if Anubis is sitting, then the item is in its proper place.
all right, get it, get it, get it, get it.
remove your shoes and step into this, please.
by a trident, which when jammed into the ground
uh, Kelly, hey, hey. Hold on a second.
Claudia, what's happening?
you need this warehouse,
no, you needed us to stop you.
this place is filling up with sand, Myka.
she must have triggered some kind of self-preservation thing,
it's probably some sort of healing device.
is that what Plato based the story of Atlantis on?
these things actually attract wind.
see what?
apparently you name your daughter Andrew,
I don't want a complicated life.
it belonged to the Corsican Brothers.
Hello, antique-y. Where'd you come from?
if H. G. Were to jam the trident into the ground there...
the amazing woman you're gonna become.
what?
each item is labeled with a hieroglyph of Anubis.
it was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria.
gave you Lizzie Borden's compact.
okay.
when it looked like Mrs. F. Might not make it, - Pete. - Yeah?
hell of a backup drive. - Can you access it?
you wanted us to follow you and stop you.
put H. G. Wells back in the bronze sector,
Ah! Initials.
you're the only real adult in the group.
Yeah. Yes.
Bryson, Bryson, it's in the middle of nowhere.
Pete, you know, if you don't want to see me anymore, it's...
H. G. didn't even have the spear with her.
no, there was plenty of doubt from everyone but me.
nutjob like you must have quite a wish list.
the entire planet is subject to your judgment now?
she, um...
if Anubis is running...
has an inventory system like ours.
uh, do you speak English?
Artie, is there...is there some kind of inventory
baby, this is good, okay?
only 6, 000 humans survived.
as my lawyer, you can give me full access.
by a catastrophic volcanic eruption.
when I saw this, I thought of you.
my daughter Christina had been murdered.
Kelly, wait a minute! Just hold on!
I know I frown at you and punch you a lot,
all right, Pete, Myka, you go to Paris.
you check the girl. I'll look for the lawyer.
there are quiet days too.
what, she gave you Lorena Bobbitt's knife?
Oh, Myka, hold on, hold on.
of Warehouse 2 even before she was bronzed.
okay, wow, the temperature is astronomical here.
if I am wrong, then kill me.
probably makes you kill the thing you love.
and then H. G. ran to see if she could turn off the orb.
weapon of mass destruction?
Pete, I'm looking at the ten original books of Plato.
H. G. Wells is to be fully reinstated hunger and famine, war and violence and hatred,
I...I've been wanting to tell you, but...
Oh, my God, you seriously intend to
uh, that's probably the rod of Asclepius.
in a moment.
because I thought I knew better than everybody else.
that explains why the trident is in two pieces.
H. G. found part of it in the 1800s
okay, now I really feel like a girl.
I can't take that chance again.
and take my life.
that knows that this is wrong,
and, Kelly...
Mr. Sempe, thank you for taking this walk with me.
well, just don't get us too close to the sun, okay?
would trigger a notion, but...
three times causes a fissure in the earth's surface.
Leena, you're the only mom they have.
he even engraved it with our favorite breed.
there was lots of clay pots and vases.
uh, I'm...I'm pretty sure I'm not ready.
if you put water in it, it turns it into a tar pit.
it would cause a chain reaction of monstrous proportions.
even I can't make women this angry.
fortunately, I'm still a lousy shot with a real gun.
there is some small part of your soul
H. G. has a huge advantage, Myka.
just to suggest that you check in on Kelly about now.
so let's look for something, you know.
help me! Help me!
does this suggest an...
why would you kill millions of innocent people?
Yes, and then the other one's right there.
and they're very...
I plan on making your life hell for a very long time.
but you, you sent her a lovely gift.
you can't quit.
let's send him a picture of us using it.
I don't know, like, a magic ladder,
the first weapon of mass destruction.
I don't know, try and live a normal life.
we're looking for "The cemetery du Ron.
she said something that kinda scared me.
from different angles.
she said that I should be ready.
so a bad thing?
and it's just pushing to get through.
I can't tell you. The image is gone.
some other weird place that we don't know about?
the last supervolcano that erupted was 75, 000 years ago.
so go ahead, make fun.
the alternative could be unpleasant.
primordial tar from Pitch Lake in Trinidad.
no, it's...it's okay.
Lizzie Borden took an ax and gave her father 40 whacks.
that, of course, is the prime directive of Warehouse agents.
but I found some bones in the garbage today
and you want to know, ready for what, Hmm?
I'm really glad you found someone, Pete.
H. G. Wells was a formidable opponent.
he may have left something behind.
we both know the Warehouse is my happiest place.
okay, it's official. I'm a girl.
it's not a spear.
but millions of us are struggling against that every day.
if I do, I'll second-guess myself into oblivion.
it has to be here. This is the address.
this planet needs a rest from what you've done to it.
now what did Myka say, that the tips have points or...
um, Artie, can I talk to you about something?
I intend to use it right here, right now.
I've been, um... trying to figure out ways
go!
I put the entire world in jeopardy.
Claudia, take care of Pete and Artie.
and make sure that Artie eats right.
this...this is the right life for you.
I'm afraid it's caused Arthur to have some sort of psychotic break.
stop right there! - Artie, we can help you.
I am not Artie.
when Artie used the astrolabe, it turned him evil. - Who are you?
you're in my way.
a vibe, I just got hit with a big one.
Oh, my God!
the deadliest artifact in warehouse 8 was a strange, blue orchid that released a disease - called "English sweating sickness." - Artie!
I think Artie's going to use the dagger to open the container and get the orchid.
he'll release an epidemic that potentially could wipe out half of the world's population.
I know you're still in there! I know you can hear me!
save me.
I cast you out! - Claudia, no!
did you really think that you'd get away with it?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
well, somebody ate the last of the oatmeal scotchies in the kitchen.
and you automatically blame me.
Where's due process?
have we lost all semblance of civility?
you have crumbs on your shirt, Artie.
circumstantial.
didn't somebody tell me they'd like to lose ten pounds by summer, and that I should lock up all the sweets?
Yes, and you've done a terrible job, but don't worry.
I forgive you.
we're going in! Hold on! Lot of wind! This could get rough!
he was back, I swear.
it was our Artie. He said my name, and I saw it in his eyes for a second before...
she had to stab him, okay? There was no other way.
he was... He was good again, and then... Then he was gone.
we must deal with the release of the sickness.
every person on the planet is now at risk. We have a great deal of work to do.
turning now to world news, doctors in Europe are reporting a curious outbreak.
dozens of patients have turned up complaining of dizziness and dehydration due to excessive sweating.
it's all being chalked up to the unseasonably hot, humid weather that's gripped Western Europe this past week.
officials are asking people to stay indoors and drink plenty of water till the heat wave passes.
when we come back, why is this secretary of state taking salsa lessons?
the answer might surprise you. More after the break.
we're all infected with the sweating sickness.
Dr. Calder is in Atlanta with the CDC.
she says we don't have very much time.
before what? What... what happens?
chills, rapid pulse, intense thirst, heart pain.
ultimately death.
right. You know, it's always "Ultimately death."
I mean, artifacts never release a plague of tickles or an epidemic of kittens.
some do. They end badly too.
I've been coordinating with the rest of the regents.
the virus is spreading even more rapidly than we thought.
how much time do we have? - The incubation period is usually 24 hours.
we left Germany eight hours ago. - So we have 16 hours to fix what Artie did.
it wasn't Artie! Not our Artie.
how is he? Now? I mean...
he's still catatonic. We were able to remove the dagger.
no internal damage, of course. - How is that even possible?
Claudia knows.
I...I didn't know, not then.
at least, I wasn't sure. I was just...
acting on instinct, and you did very well.
Why? How does the dagger work?
tell them.
you know.
the dagger separates something evil, the orchid, from something good, the box holding it, so with Artie...
you separated the evil from Artie.
you brought him back.
it belonged to a jesuit priest who performed the first exorcism.
I didn't know what I was doing,
I just knew I had to do it, but now we could still lose him.
we could, yes.
but you do have a plan? - We have a theory.
you two, you're with me.
come on. Come on!
Artie's mind seems to be failing.
and you can't pull him out of it? - When dr. "V" gets here, maybe she can...
there isn't time.
we need to reach his subconscious and pull him back before his mind completely shuts down.
if we don't... - Artie won't come home.
so what's your theory?
an artifact, right? - What else?
what do we know thus far?
well, we know that sweating sickness first occurred in Europe and that there were several outbreaks between 1485 and 1551.
also we know that some of the outbreaks are said to have wiped out half the populations they hit.
and every time, the disease vanished.
right, the orchid turns to ash and releases the plague.
right, but when we found the orchid, it was whole, even though it had already released the disease in the 1500s, so there must be a way to reconstitute it.
an artifact that brings a flower back to life.
nothing springs to mind.
I know.
I wish Artie was here.
but who am I kidding? Even if we saved him,
I mean, the man killed Leena.
how does he come back from that?
how do we?
both Leena and Arthur cared about one thing above all else, and that is keeping the world safe from harm.
we will find a solution.
right, so I have artifacts that make flowers huge.
I've got artifacts that make them poisonous, that make them not poisonous, - but not a single one that turns ashes into an orchid. - The count of St. German.
who? - He was a charlatan in the 18th century. He claimed many supernatural abilities, including the power to bring sickly plants back to bountiful, blooming health.
he performed the trick in public several times.
it sounds like the count was using an artifact.
Yes, question is what, and where is it now? Keep digging.
this belonged to Sigmund Freud.
it will allow your subconscious to interact with Artie's and hopefully, discover why he is trapped.
Yes, done. I'm in.
you're not going in without me.
why do you think I asked for both of you?
no one seemed to take the count seriously, or what he did.
there're no references to what artifacts he might have used.
there's very little information about him.
Hey, Hey, hey. I think this guy's got the dirt.
professor at Columbia University, foremost expert on the court of Marie Antoinette.
Yeah, and if his take is right, guess who spent a lot of time crashing on Marie's Couch.
the count of St. German.
he wrote a lot about him. It's worth a shot, right?
talk to him, find out what he knows, and...
you may need this.
when you're ready, join hands.
holy metaphor.
Artie's brain is... - The warehouse.
well, I can't say I'm surprised.
I figured it had to be either this or a magical land made entirely of donuts.
Artie could be anywhere. - Not really. Think about it.
if the warehouse is his brain, where would he live?
his office. His real-life nerve center. Nice, we just have to get over there.
you need to leave.
Vanessa, good. You're here, you...
will you, for once, do what you're told?
wait a minute. That's not Vanessa.
look at how she's dressed. That's what she was wearing in a rapid city.
this must be the version of Vanessa that lives in Artie's head, his memory of her.
I'll go check that out.
you need to leave.
it's not safe. - We need to save Artie.
Artie doesn't want you here.
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna take...
this whole place is shutting down.
and so is Artie. - You see, it's too dangerous.
you should go, right now.
professor Sutton?
Hello? - Wow.
Oh, my God. - This place looks like it's been tossed.
maybe we're not the only ones after this professor.
excuse me, ma'am, was there a break-in here?
no. - Professor Sutton's Office always looks this way.
Ah, kind of makes my room Look pretty good, don't it?
uh, well, we were supposed to have a meeting with him.
do you know where he is?
company!
enjoy.
and there he is.
whoever you are, you're hovering.
speak, or pour me a drink and don't speak.
professor, we have an appointment.
Oh, the government agents.
uh, it turns out my day is full.
afraid I'll have to postpone. Regrets.
Oh, well.
well, you're reasonably hot.
what say you ditch the, uh, forehead here, and interrogate me?
what say you just answer our questions?
Mmm, sexy. Ask me anything.
well, I...
this is the man who's supposed to help us save the world.
don't tell the world. It'll panic.
Hey, hey, professor. - Oh!
Hey, wake up!
listen, we need you to tell us everything you know about the count of St. German.
that's remarkable, you could rent it out as billboard space.
Oh, really? Well, we could rent you out as a kerosene lamp.
okay? - Pete!
we are running out of time.
Oh, there's always time for love, no?
No!
fine.
all right, look out.
Attaboy. You all right?
no, um... - Yeah.
I'm a little drunk.
right, the count was a scoundrel, a grifter.
claimed wild, supernatural abilities, but he was also entertaining, which meant a lot in the days before Reality TV.
he must have been incredibly charming to wheedle his way into some royal courts that, trust me, would never have accepted him otherwise.
Oh, like Marie Antoinette's.
Yes, precisely. She was a fan, for a while.
apparently, briefly enamored of his ability to bring any dead or dying Flora back to vibrant life.
how? How did he do it?
was he ever holding some kind of a special object?
holding an object? No.
no, not according to my research. - Great, another dead end.
although, he always did wear a rather garish ring.
Yes, now we are getting somewhere.
you're gonna throw up, aren't you?
Oh, oh, hold on, hold on. - Pete, get him a...
no, no, no. No, no, no, no!
two steps forward, one puke back.
we can't just leave Artie in here. I mean, his brain is shutting down.
he could get stuck. - And if you stay, you could get lost in here too.
he doesn't want that. - We're just trying to help.
let's try this.
Claudia, look.
Artie's bag of tricks. What did I tell you?
there is still some part of him that wants us to find him.
it's like in Germany, where...
Whoa! - Claudia!
I did warn you.
now go!
he really wants us to leave.
wouldn't be the first time I didn't do what Artie wanted.
find the ring.
Why?
uh, for research purposes. - Oh, well, it won't be easy.
the count's things were all buried with him in the catacombs under Paris.
all right, so we go to Paris. She knows every language there is.
Yes, well, your first problem is that Marie placed an impenetrable lock on the crypt.
it's, uh... It's rather curious, actually.
anyone who tried to get through wound up flayed alive, - so unless you know a good locksmith... - Well, we really don't have problems with locks.
we got a bitchin' set of tools.
it's actually not the locks that I'm worried about.
it's the catacombs under Paris. - Yes, your second problem.
they're notoriously difficult to navigate. - Okay.
Yes, generations of naive tourists, crypt raiders, and drunken university Students got lost down there, permanently.
we don't have time to get lost. Time is running out.
for the... research that we're doing. - Pete, we have Baudin's map.
you do? - We do?
well, the place that we...
work for... does.
nicolas Baudin, he was a French explorer.
most people don't know that he charted the French catacombs before he left on his famous Australian expedition.
no, most people don't. - We could have Mrs. Frederic scan it and send it to us.
she's our, uh... - Boss.
I know Baudin's map, but unfortunately, it's just meaningless blather without the legend.
he's right.
why do I have a feeling that you have this legend?
and I'd be willing to share, if you could convince your government friends that I don't need to pay taxes, ever, including what I owe.
how about you just give us the legend and we don't arrest you?
Ooh, negotiation. Sexy.
technically, I don't have the legend, but I know who does, and by the way,
I only fly first class when others pay.
I only fly first class when others pay.
come on, Claud, this way's still open.
damn it! Every room keeps getting blocked.
there's a way, we'll find it.
or... we could just...
glare at it.
I hate this.
the warehouse was supposed to do good, but instead, it just keeps killing the people I love.
well, that's kind of a simplification. - Is it, though?
you died, Leena died, and now, the whole damn world is dying.
Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and Myka will find a cure.
they will. - So what?
it's not gonna save Leena.
and Artie?
I stabbed Artie with a dagger!
why bother if we just keep losing?
because it's not the win, it's the fight.
evil is relentless. It always has been.
you take one evil out, and another one pops up to replace it.
worst Pep talk ever.
but if we stop fighting, if we give up, what does that say about us?
I knew that Sykes was dangerous, but we had to stop him.
Mrs. Frederic warned Leena to get out, but she stayed to help Artie.
and you, you knew the world needed saving, even if it cost you the only father you've ever known.
the fight, that's what matters.
lovely, but you were asked to go.
Oh, this is not good. - Oh, it's so bad.
since you won't go, I'll see to it that you make no further progress.
what was that you were saying about knocking out one evil and another one popping up?
good news is I was right.
this disease is not spreading. It has spread.
those are the words of Dr. Vanessa Calder from the CDC in Atlanta.
the illness, which only a few hours ago was thought to be simple dehydration confined to Europe, has quickly spread to virtually every corner of the globe.
the CDC is classifying the outbreak as a worldwide pandemic, the fastest to have been declared as such in the agency's history.
we'll be covering this crisis around the clock. Stay with us.
wait, the legend is here?
you said it was in a collection. Somebody lives here.
people live lots of places.
Yeah, well, I'll bet you know who lives here, and not in a good way. - Don't wrinkle your forehead.
you look like sheet music.
I have a handsome forehead, okay? Just ask my Mom.
Oh, and on the plane, I swiped your nuts.
wait, that's...
so who lives here? - Fine, Charlotte Dupres, - who, as it turns out, is a rival of mine. - Professors have rivals?
well, Charlotte is merely a collector, a well-funded fan.
I'm the expert.
well, let's just ask Charlotte if we can come in and take a picture of the legend.
she'd never agree to it. She's paranoid and delusional.
great, that's what this needs.
she'd just accuse us of trying to break into her precious home.
are we trying to break into her precious home?
there's no one at her precious home. - She's out of the country.
where is she? - Barcelona.
she may have received a message that made her leap on the first plane.
convenient, no?
okay, it's obvious that you have another agenda, - so can we just stop playing games? - Oh, excellent idea.
let's discuss the ring and your plan to use it. I am a history professor.
I know what sweating sickness looks like, and I know the rumor.
"an orchid that can make the sweating sickness come and go"?
am I close to the mark?
maybe. - No.
I think the orchid has come back again, and you two need that ring to reconstitute it to save the world. Bull's-eye?
I'll take your Slack-Jawed silence as confirmation.
so help me break in here, stop the disease, or don't and don't.
it's your choice.
cocoons are not as comfortable as they sound.
What'd she throw at us? - That's William Hornaday's cap.
director of the Bronx Zoo. In 1906, he rather infamously put a human pygmy in a cage with chimpanzees to demonstrate the missing link.
are these things getting tighter? I don't care for this...
they're, like, unbreakable... and rather tangy.
pulling at them makes them tighter, by the way. - The darkness is getting closer.
spear.
Yes, okay. Yeah. How are you gonna...
Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah, I think, uh, if you put a little bit more oomph...
Yeah, no, I know, I know.
your center of gravity... - I'm trying to do that, Claud.
I know. I just need a little bit of concen...
would you just give me a little... - the center of gravity is lowest...
I am an ATF agent, damn it!
Oh, man. - Ugh.
Ugh! - I sure could've used you when I was locked up.
you got skills.
thanks...
let's get to the office. - Good plan.
good plan.
Hello, miss Donovan. Long time no see.
Oh, man, I hate Artie's brain.
alarm system.
Yeah, you've got 15 seconds before the alarm goes off. - Okay. Okay.
I got this. I saw Artie do it once.
not that I've tried, but Charlotte's birth date and license plate numbers don't work.
bingo.
brilliant toys.
I wish I would have met you two years ago.
so you tried to break in here before.
what exactly are you after?
Ticktock, sweating sickness. Shall we proceed?
find the legend, save the world, et cetera, et cetera.
all right, children, playtime's over.
Olly olly oxen free. - That's Macpherson?
I always pictured him with a mustache.
why does Artie even have James Macpherson in his brain?
he hates Macpherson.
Arthur sees me as the embodiment of danger and evil.
and he can hear us. - But he also knows I'm very strong, and right now, he needs someone powerful to get you two out!
Oh, good casting, Artie.
I'm out of ideas. You have any?
just one, and you're not gonna like it.
remember, you're the one who can really save Artie.
Steve, what are you doing?
stick with me, Claud! Macpherson will never catch up!
so brave.
the real Macpherson would have enjoyed this very much.
hunting human targets? - No!
catching them. - Not today, James.
what's happened? Where's Claudia?
she's still in there.
I hope.
okay, let's just get the legend and get out of here.
she thinks all of this belongs to her. Arrogant woman.
I'll check the other room.
you know, people are getting sicker, and we're stuck here with that pompous...
are you all right?
Yeah.
okay, so if I was a filthy-rich, possibly crazy hoarder who likes old counts, - where would I... - Pete?
yeah? - I think that there's something we may have missed.
you just couldn't stay away, could you?
if I blow your heart out of your chest, you think that'll stop you?
I'm gonna guess that's Charlotte.
Artie, are you in there?
Artie, I'm coming in!
I warned you not to come.
we were trying to save you.
we thought you were trapped.
do I look trapped?
I don't want you here.
what are you... You... Are you hiding?
Artie... - You'll ruin everything.
what will I ruin? - Did you think that you'd get away with it?
someone ate the last of the oatmeal scotchies in the kitchen.
you're not in Barcelona. - There's a worldwide pandemic.
that sort of thing brings a halt to international travel.
they've just shut down the airport. - And you didn't berate them into taking you anyway?
what unusual behavior for you.
your brains all over my walls.
I've tripped the alarm. The police are on their way.
you and your friends can explain everything to them.
we're not really his friends, per se.
the extent to which I do not care cannot be measured.
you just think you're so much smarter than everybody else, don't you?
well, there's actually quite a lot of evidence supporting that theory.
uh, dude? I think I'd, you know, close the piehole while she's got the...
Charlotte, listen to me. We are not stealing from you, okay?
we are secret service agents. We're on a mission...
you're not here to steal?
then why does the good professor have my precious gold coins in his pocket?
you know, I found these, uh, on the floor.
sloppy, sloppy, Charlotte.
Sutton here is not really acting on our behalf.
no, my dear, Sutton only ever acts on Sutton's behalf, which is why his behalf is being carted off to jail.
you're not going to turn me over to them.
it's done. - Hey, I did it.
I found the kill switch for the alarm. - There's no kill switch here.
you two are quite good! - Oh, thank you.
why'd you do that? I mean, not that I'm complaining.
you're gonna have to ask him. - I think he's gonna need a minute.
Artie, if you stay, you'll be lost in here forever.
and that's a problem, why? Things are better in here.
things are the way I want them to be.
it's not real. - "Real" is overrated.
you think this is better because Leena's here, but it's not safe. You can't just stay in here in denial, Artie.
you have to come out and face...
No!
FA... Face what, Artie?
leave it, Claudia. - You'll disappear.
I know. That's what I want!
she wouldn't want it.
if I go with you, then I will have to remember.
I'll remember...
her face before...
she trusted me, and she didn't understand.
and... And then...
no.
why would you make me remember that?
so far, there are no confirmed deaths, but we do know that tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of victims have been affected by the sweating sickness crisis.
the CDC fears devastating statistics by morning.
there is no question we are now witness to the worst catastrophe in recorded medical history.
I'm being told the president is about to make a statement.
we go now to the press room at the White House.
your partner has a fantastic right hook.
now, shouldn't we scram before the police arrive?
Oh, no.
phone call from a crazy lady on the fancy end of Paris?
I don't think that's a priority for the gendarme tonight, what with the whole world sweating to death and all.
I think we got a minute. - He lied to us, Pete.
no, no, technically, I did not lie to you.
I have a pretty good eye for detail, professor.
uh, just so you know, this is very hot.
all that research that you showed us?
conspicuously Absent were portraits of the count.
not one!
and then I saw...
this.
you are not an expert on the count of St. German.
you are the count of St. German.
you don't look very well. - Note that he is not denying...
we really should be going, so...
just tell us the truth! You're the count.
all right, yes. I'm the count.
what.
okay, okay.
so, you're... You're, like, really, really old, with a lot more "Really" s.
are you... What are you... are you, like, a vampire?
Oh, please. Vampires are for gothic novels, and apparently, preadolescent girls.
I don't know, I kinda... I kinda like vampires.
how is this even possible? - Alchemy.
an alchemist used a stone, a particular stone, to keep my body from aging.
Oh, great, another artifact we have to look for.
no, don't bother. Long gone, so is the alchemist.
so you're 300 years old?
that's amazing.
519, actually. I moisturize.
so you were hiding?
no, just lying about my age, and who I am, and where I'm from.
I've made my way quite well, actually.
fortunately, man is just as gullible today as he was 500 years ago, but with a smaller vocabulary.
so you became a professor that specializes in the 1700s.
write what you know, and when two government agents asked about my ring, I saw an opportunity.
all this stuff that Charlotte has...
all these antiques that are hundreds and hundreds of years old...
this is yours, and you just, what, want 'em back?
exactly, and your legend. I'm not selfish.
I merely thought while we were here, I might as well - Nick an old memento or two. - Ah, yes.
coincidently, all the gold ones, right, chap?
we didn't find the legend. - You didn't.
I snatched it while you two ladies were busy gabbing about what a cad I am.
what is this? - Open it up.
that's the legend to the map.
you see? I really am trying to help.
come now.
you've got to be a tiny bit impressed.
all right, fine, I am a tiny bit impressed.
thank you.
Yes. Right then, off to the catacombs.
stakes high, lives in the balance, blah, blah, danger cakes. Shall we?
all right. - Let's get going before Charlotte kicks her way out of that closet.
so you were really friends with Marie Antoinette?
uh, not friends, per se.
well, we were, then we weren't. The woman seemed to think I was using her for her money.
and why would she think that?
probably because I was using her for her money. - Pretty big haul?
it was going to be my retirement. Marie's Violet sunrise.
the diamond?
Oh, my God. - What? Big?
people wrote stories about it.
I wrote two of them. It was worth untold riches.
once I had it, no more cons, I'd be out, but I misjudged.
what do you mean, you misju...
Oh. They bumped uglies.
some things are eternal. You know, "a woman, scorned."
no fury to match it. She tried to have me beheaded.
rather her thing. - Don't jilt a queen.
I disappeared. Left everything behind, everything I'd worked so hard to get.
you mean everything that you fleeced from all your innocent victims.
I believe that's what I said.
including my ring, by the way.
Pete, look.
so how do you have a public funeral without a body?
Marie used one of her servants.
a dear, sweet, boy named Sebastian.
poor Marie. She wasn't well.
declining popularity, I heard.
these faces.
this one's Greek, this is Greek, this is Greek, but this one, - his face is Chinese. - They're all Greek to me.
it's the lock. - Be careful.
well, I imagine one or two of these gentlemen were sent here by you.
they were all well-paid.
bingo.
how do you even use that thing?
we know what we're doing.
okay.
anyone flayed? All safe now?
Yeah, it's clear.
we're the first people in this room for hundreds of years.
it's... - Impressive.
but also a little creepy.
I mean, it is your tomb.
Pete, the ring.
that's it.
let's do this then.
what the hell was that?
what, is this another one of Marie's deterrents?
I had no idea she booby-trapped the whole place!
that woman is so paranoid!
let's get the hell out of here!
look out!
Oh, no. Oh, God. - Come on!...
there you go. - It's safe over here. Come on, we gotta get you up.
Oh, that would be nice. I'm going a bit numb, and rather quickly.
a poison Dart, typical Marie.
we'll find you an antidote.
what, in the catacombs? Myka, you're too smart for sentimentality.
there's no time.
I always wondered if being ageless meant being immortal.
apparently, a poison Dart through the heart will kill me.
that's good to know. I won't do that again.
you saved me. - Well, as I said, beautiful women are my fatal flaw.
go on, use the ring.
I won't have the entire world upstage my big death scene.
no, no, we can't leave you here. - Are you insane?
I can't resist the poetry.
this is my crypt.
go.
save the world.
okay.
we did it.
we saved everybody.
almost everybody.
what did you remember, Artie? What's wrong?
it wasn't you.
something got to you. Something made you do it.
why is it so dark?
it's reality finding its way in.
she brought it.
this isn't real?
no.
I'm sorry, Artie, but I think a bigger part of you wants to leave.
in Germany, you said, "save me," so I did, and I'd do it again, and again and again and again, no matter how angry you get.
you gave yourself clues, Artie.
like this door.
there's no door in this spot at Leena's.
but it's more than just a door, isn't it?
it's the way out.
what makes you so sure you know what's right?
because I know you, and I don't think you're done fighting, even if you don't know it yet.
it's the fight that matters, Artie.
now go!
No! - Yes!
I'm sorry.
Claudia, listen to me.
there was nothing more we could have done.
we tried... - Hey. Where's Artie?
Mrs. Frederic said, "He was awake."
he is. Claudia brought him back.
he won't talk to us...
this is going to be harder than we thought.
go away.
that's the nice thing about being me.
I don't take orders from you.
Oh, God, what have I done?
it wasn't you.
Yeah, but she's still gone... by my hand.
Yes.
Yes. And how do I fix that?
you can't.
exactly.
I wish you could, but there are some things...
many things... That cannot be fixed.
you can, however, fix yourself, if you want to.
I want to fight, but...
good.
luckily for you, there are many smart people in your life who love you. They want to help you.
we'll make it through this... together.
won't we?
what were you playing then?
poor Sebastian.
Marie always said you were honest and loyal...
all the things our good count was not.
hundreds of years, and he hasn't changed at all.
you're in here.
and my lying, cheating husband is once again out in the world, and with Marie's diamond.
but I have plans too.
wrong, as usual.
the United States' lack of action in Eastern Europe...
...proves that the Soviet Union's aggression at the Afghan border...
...will not be opposed publicly by the United States.
issue: The Soviet Union continued its recent series of military exercises...
...conducting a bomb test today in the Bering Sea...
...just 1500 miles off the southern coast of Alaska.
president Richard Nixon issued this warning to the Soviets:
the United States does not start fights.
let it be clear we maintain our strength...
...in order to maintain peace...
...so any adversary should ask themselves:
do the consequences of attacking America...
...outweigh the potential benefits?
as a result of the Soviet activity...
...the watchdog group of nuclear scientists...
...moved the Doomsday Clock up to five minutes until midnight...
...destruction by nuclear war.
question:
on a scale of zero to 10, zero meaning impossibility...
...10 meaning complete metaphysical certitude...
...what are the chances the Russians will actually attack the United States?
pat Buchanan.
the Soviets would never risk going to war...
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent on our side.
you're referring, of course, to Dr. Manhattan...
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.
well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union...
...from stockpiling record amounts of nuclear weapons.
you don't think it's just posturing?
maybe the reason why the Soviets...
...are doing these bomb tests...
...is because they feel threatened by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.
maybe the whole world feels like that.
soviet ships have violated the territorial waters...
just a matter of time, I suppose.
it's a joke. It's all a joke.
mother, forgive me.
I was a hero, goddamn it!
...an act clearly meant to send a signal to the government in Saigon...
...that violence and oppression is not the way to peace.
fuck you, pigs!
good luck, Mr. Gorsky.
get out of here, vigilantes!
No!
edward Blake. Sixty-seven years old. Six-two, a solid 225.
guy was built like a linebacker.
Yeah, I saw the body.
for a guy his age, he was in terrific shape.
you mean apart from being dead?
that's plate glass.
you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in it.
had to have been thrown.
check the bedroom?
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.
mattress flipped. Probably robbery.
or made to look like one.
see this?
shaking hands with the president. Whoa.
think Blake was a spook?
government or black ops?
I think...
...this is way bigger than both of us.
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.
dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on burst stomach.
this city's afraid of me.
I've seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters...
...and the gutters are full of blood.
and when the drains finally scab over...
...all the vermin will drown.
the accumulated filth of all their sex and murder...
...will foam up around their waists...
...and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, "Save us."
and I'll whisper, "No."
now the whole world stands on the brink...
...staring down into bloody hell.
all those liberals and intellectuals...
...and smooth talkers...
...and all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.
beneath me, this awful city.
it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children...
...and the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
somebody knows why.
somebody knows.
it all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.
pirate outfits, ghosts.
they thought it was funny: dress up and pull heists.
as soon as we'd arrest them, they'd be back on the street.
nobody could pick them out of a lineup because of the damn masks.
so a few of us cops, we get together...
...and we figure, what the heck, we'll mask up, too.
we'll finish what the law couldn't.
pretty soon, the papers get wind of it. They ran with it...
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.
it was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.
Oh, don't get me started on him.
I must be drunk already, telling you this sob story again.
I think you were trying to make a point.
well, my point is that we had it too easy. It wasn't fair what happened to you guys...
you guys who picked up where we left off. -with Nixon forcing you out.
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted for that prick five times.
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight. Gotta go.
truth?
you were a better Nite Owl than I ever was, Danny boy.
Hollis, we both know that's bullshit. -Hey.
watch it with the language.
this is the left hook that floored Captain Axis, remember?
Yeah.
next week? Well...
...you know, you don't have to keep humoring me like this.
if you got a hot date or something...
Hey, us retired guys have to stick together, right?
you ever miss it?
no. You?
Oh, heck, no.
be seeing you.
Hello, Daniel.
Rorschach.
helped myself to some beans. Hope you don't mind.
no, no. Course not.
you want me to heat those up for you?
fine like this.
how have you been keeping?
out of prison.
so far.
Daniel...
...look at this.
is this bean juice? Human bean juice.
badge belonged to the Comedian. Blood too. He's dead.
let's talk downstairs.
it could have been a burglary.
maybe the killer didn't know who the Comedian was.
an ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.
I heard he'd been working for the government since '77...
...knocking over Marxist republics in South America.
maybe it was a political killing or something.
maybe.
maybe someone's picking off costumed heroes.
you don't think that's a little paranoid?
that what they say about me now?
paranoid?
look, Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years...
...even among his friends.
speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?
he wrote that book. Said some bad things about the Comedian in it.
I don't like what you're implying, and I like being followed even less.
maybe I was keeping an eye on you, in case someone's gunning for masks.
you were never that sentimental. -Attack on one is attack on all of us.
what do you suggest we do about it?
retribution.
watchmen are over. -Says Tricky Dick.
says me.
nobody knows who you are.
you can give it up, try and have a normal life.
that what you have now? A normal life?
when you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies...
...past the human cockroaches...
...talking about their heroin and child pornography...
...do you really feel normal?
least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.
no.
you're hiding in plain sight.
be seeing you, Dan.
a maintenance hatch will let you out two blocks north.
Yeah, I remember.
came here often, when we were partners.
those were great times, huh, Rorschach?
what happened? -You quit.
Mr. Veidt...
...to date, you're one of only two Watchmen...
...ever to reveal their true identity to the world...
...the first being Hollis Mason.
and you've certainly profited greatly by it...
...turning your superhero alter ego, Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:
toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.
I understand there's a movie in the works.
I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth. -I'm sorry. Do you think...
the Watchmen resent me for prostituting their struggle?
it's a fair question. Yes, it's crossed my mind...
...some of my old colleagues might see it that way...
...just as you're clearly aware that biased journalism...
...sells more magazines.
the merchandising arm of Veidt Industries is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.
we recently expanded our research facility in Antarctica...
...in the hope of developing cheap, renewable sources of energy...
...that we might eliminate the world's reliance on fossil fuels.
now, it doesn't take a political scientist...
...to see that our Cold War with the Russians isn't ideological...
...It's based upon fear. Fear of not having enough.
but if we make resources infinite...
...we make war obsolete.
I would hope the other Watchmen understand that...
...wherever they may be.
thanks for your time.
you look good, Adrian. -Dan.
it's been too long.
so Rorschach thinks someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?
you think it's possible?
statistically, one murder doesn't equal a trend.
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.
and so was the Comedian. He was practically a Nazi.
you know that better than anyone.
I'm not here because I miss him.
it's occurred to Rorschach...
...that we're the only ones who know each other's identities.
actually, the whole world knows yours.
that's why I'm warning you first.
thank you, Dan...
...but I fear there's something much more real to worry about...
...than Rorschach's mask killer.
if the Russians do launch their nukes, can Jon really stop them?
the Soviets have 51, 000 warheads stockpiled.
even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...
...the 1 percent that get through could still kill every living thing on Earth.
even Dr. Manhattan can't be everywhere at once.
Rorschach's journal, October 13th, 1985...
...8: 30 pm.
meeting with Dreiberg left bad taste in mouth.
a flabby failure who sits whimpering in his basement.
why are so few of us left active...
...healthy and without personality disorders?
the first Nite Owl runs an auto-repair shop.
the first Silk Spectre is a bloated, aging whore...
...dying in a California rest resort.
dollar Bill got his cape stuck in a revolving door...
...where he got gunned down.
silhouette, murdered...
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.
only two names remain on my list.
both share private quarters at Rockefeller Military Research Center.
I shall go to them.
I shall go tell the indestructible man that someone plans to murder him.
good evening, Rorschach.
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.
yes...
...but you're going to leave disappointed.
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here. You're a wanted man.
nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.
I have a real name I've been using.
try it.
whatever you say, Laurie.
what are you doing here?
the Comedian is dead.
rorschach wants me to look into my future...
...see if the killer is ever publicly identified.
already warned Dreiberg. Came to warn you too.
even if I wanted to help...
...my future is blocked by some kind of temporal interference.
I cannot see it clearly. -Interference? Caused by what?
in all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.
if the United States and Soviet Union engage in all-out war...
...the resulting blast wave would produce a sudden burst of tachyons...
...particles which travel backward through what you perceive as time...
...therefore obscuring my vision of the present.
I must return to my work.
wait a minute.
what if that's why someone wants us out of the way?
so we can't do anything to stop it?
goodbye, Rorschach.
took a lot of effort to get in here to see you.
I'm not leaving...
...till I've had my say.
seems like there's a lot of things you don't tell me these days.
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.
if Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis, war may be averted.
but you always say time is simultaneous.
if that's true, then how can you change the future?
if only you could perceive time as I do.
please let me show you.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?
I'm putting food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
it was a mistake. One time. -Man tries to rape you...
stop!
your mind goes to dark places...
...and you wonder why I keep the worst from you.
say hello to Dan for me. -What?
you wanna ask me to go to dinner with you...
...like we used to...
...but you won't.
you know I can't.
so you'll call Dan...
...which is only natural.
you deserve the comfort of an old friend.
Dan Dreiberg's table.
did you know that he and H. J. were-? I had no idea.
you remember that crazy guy? What'd he call himself?
captain Carnage.
used to pretend he was a supervillain just so he could get beat up?
Yeah, he tried that on me once. I just walked away.
he starts following me down the street in broad daylight...
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."
God, whatever happened to him?
Oh. Um... He pulled that on Rorschach...
...and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.
it's a little funny. -Yep.
I'm glad I ordered the four-legged chicken.
it's really good to see you again.
it's great seeing you too.
why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?
no one else would. -Yeah, but do you remember my costume?
all that tight latex? I mean, it was awful.
uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.
but didn't wanna disappoint Mother.
wanted her little girl to be just like her and fight bad guys.
I think the Keene Act was the best thing that ever happened to us.
well, we'll live longer anyway.
what?
jon thinks, unless he can do something about it...
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.
soon.
but I don't know what to think. I mean, it's all...
...quantum mechanics and parallel realities with him.
I never even know what universe he's actually seeing.
he just keeps getting further away from me.
everyone.
I can't even tell if he actually cares about me anymore...
...or if he's just pretending.
if he's pretending, it means he cares.
hold on, I'll get the door.
Thanks, Dan.
got it? -Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I invite you out to dinner to catch up and have a few laughs...
...but there don't seem to be many laughs around these days.
what do you expect? The Comedian's dead.
Laurie? Is that you?
thought you'd be used to traveling that way by now.
well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me.
well, it beats flying coach.
margarita?
mother, it's 2: 00 in the afternoon.
remember that guy that writes me letters?
he sent me an item of memorabilia. It's a Tijuana bible.
this little eight-page porno comic they did in the '30s and '40s.
he sent you this? -Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.
mother, this is gross.
I think it's kind of flattering.
why do you always call me Mother when you're mad?
I know why you're here. I can still read, you know.
I saw it in the paper.
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.
finally got his punchline, I guess.
poor Eddie. -Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.
you don't know.
things change.
what happened happened 40 years ago.
I'm 67 years old.
every day, the future looks a little bit darker.
but the past...
...even the grimy parts of it...
...keep on getting brighter.
I've got spots in my eyes.
stop it, Eddie.
thank you, Weegee. -Thank you, Mr. Owl.
tomorrow, 3: 00, my studio.
little place on 21 st. -Sounds good.
wow, a real photo session. Wonder how my hair will look?
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.
Eddie.
what the hell are you doing here? You knew I was changing.
sure I did.
come on, baby.
I know what you need.
you gotta have some kind of reason for dressing in an outfit like this.
I said no, Eddie.
no spelled Y-E-S. -No spelled N-O.
all right? -Come on, sweetheart.
Eddie...
you little bastard.
this what you like?
this what makes you hot? -What?
things are tough all over, cupcake.
it rains on the just and the unjust alike.
the Comedian was a little bit of both.
and he always thought he'd get the last laugh.
thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.
shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers...
...but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty...
...O holy and merciful savior.
thou most worthy judge eternal.
suffer us not at our last hour for any...
fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.
you know, you'd think this goddamn country had had enough fireworks.
you know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...
...I think it might have driven us crazy. You know, as a country.
but we didn't, thanks to you.
you sound bitter.
me? Bitter?
fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mr. Eddie? -Just what I fucking needed.
the war is over now. We must talk about this baby.
there's nothing to talk about. See, I'm leaving.
I'm gonna forget about you...
...and your horrible, sweaty, little piece-of-shit country.
get the fuck out of here.
no. -Get the fuck out of here.
you will remember.
you will remember me and my country...
...forever!
my face!
Blake. Don't.
Blake!
she was pregnant...
...and you gunned her down.
that's right...
...and you know what? You watched me.
you could have turned the gun to steam, the bullets to mercury...
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes, but you didn't, did you?
you really don't give a damn about human beings.
you're drifting out of touch, Doc.
God help us all.
medic!
most holy and merciful savior.
he cometh up and is cut down, like a flower.
in the midst of life, we are in death.
welcome to the first meeting- -This is bullshit.
for a guy who calls himself the Comedian, I can never tell when you're joking.
watchmen. That's the real joke.
it didn't work 15 years ago, and it ain't gonna work now...
...because you wanna play cowboys and Indians.
maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings.
rorschach and I have made headway on the gang problem by working together.
a group this size seems like a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.
we can do so much more.
we can save this world...
...with the right leadership. -Yeah.
and that'd be you, right, Ozzy?
I mean, hell, you're the smartest man on the planet.
it doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems.
but it takes a room of morons to think they're small enough for you to handle.
you know, mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time.
now we finally have the power to finish the job.
ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.
then Ozymandias here...
...will be the smartest man on the cinder.
Watchmen! Police! Police to protect the people!
attention, citizens. We are trying to maintain order.
you must clear the streets until the police strike is over.
if you could- Please, there's no need for violence.
goddamn it. All right. That's how you wanna do it?
there's no need for violence.
fuck you. Fuck you!
Oh, this is getting heavy.
goddamn, I love working on American soil, Dan.
ain't had this much fun since Woodward and Bernstein.
how long can we keep this up?
congress is pushing through some new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.
our days are numbered.
until then, it's like you always say: We're society's only protection.
from what? -Are you kidding me? From themselves.
son of a bitch. No, Comedian, wait!
get your stinking hands off me.
what the hell happened to us?
what happened to the American dream?
what happened to the American dream?
it came true!
you're looking at it.
Edgar William Jacobi.
also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as Moloch.
what are you talking about?
I'm a retired businessman...
lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.
I did my time.
I'm not Moloch anymore.
what do you want from me? -Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?
I just felt I should...
...pay my respects to the Comedian.
how'd you know he was the Comedian? -He broke in here. A week ago.
he had his mask off.
he was drunk. -Enemies. For decades.
why should he visit you? -I don't know.
I woke up in my bedroom and there he was.
he was upset.
he was crying.
crying? The Comedian?
he was babbling, not making any sense.
I was pissing in my pants.
I thought he was gonna kill me.
what did he say?
it's a joke.
it's all a fucking joke.
you know, I thought I knew how it was.
I thought I knew how the world was.
I've done some bad things.
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.
in 'Nam, you know.
but that was fucking war.
this...
I never done anything like this.
God, here I am...
...spilling my guts...
...to one of my archenemies.
but the truth is...
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got. What the fuck does that say?
shit.
and your name...
...your name was on the list...
...along with Janey, you know, whatever the fuck her name is.
Manhattan's old girl.
mother, forgive me.
and then he left.
I swear I don't know what the hell he was talking about.
funny story.
sounds unbelievable.
probably true.
so that's it?
I'm clean? -You?
clean?
amygdalin.
this phony medication made from apricot pits.
it's illegal. -Come on.
please don't confiscate that.
I'm trying anything.
I have cancer.
what kind of cancer?
you know the kind you eventually get better from?
that ain't the kind I got.
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.
want some of this? Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.
thought about Moloch's story. -Come on.
could all be lies.
a revenge scheme planned during his years behind bars.
fuck you. I make more in a week than you make in a year, you fucking homo.
but if it's true...
...what could have possibly scared the Comedian...
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?
what was it he saw?
and that list he mentioned.
edward Blake. The Comedian.
born 1918.
buried in the rain.
murdered.
is that what happens to us? No time for friends?
only our enemies leave roses.
violent lives ending violently.
Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature.
no matter how much you try to dress it up...
...to disguise it...
...Blake saw society's true face.
chose to be a parody of it. A joke.
I heard joke once.
man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.
life seems harsh and cruel.
says he feels all alone in threatening world.
doctor says treatment is simple.
the great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him.
that should pick you up."
man bursts into tears.
but doctor," he says. "I am Pagliacci."
good joke.
everybody laugh.
roll on snare drum.
curtains.
what time do you have to be at your interview?
don't worry.
we've got plenty of time.
your finger's like licking a battery.
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?
please don't be upset.
I always thought you liked this.
no.
I don't-No.
I don't want that.
I don't know what stimulates you anymore.
look, I know you were just trying...
are you working in here while we're in bed together?
my work with Adrian is at a critical stage right now.
I didn't think it was necessary to- -To what?
to what? To tell me which one of you is giving me a pity fuck?
my attention was completely focused on you.
if you think there's a problem with my attitude...
...I am prepared to discuss it.
you know how everything in this world fits together except people.
what am I to you? Another puzzle to be solved?
have your men stand back. I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.
you're my only remaining link to the world.
I don't want that responsibility anymore.
he's all yours.
don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.
no, she won't.
he's been called many things: Hero, weapon...
...linchpin of our national security...
...deterrent to nuclear war, or a man to end worlds.
later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...
...will answer my questions and yours in an exclusive interview...
...brought to you commercial-free by Veidt Enterprises.
who is it?
it's Laurie.
sorry. I just had this new lock installed.
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, it's okay. Come in.
what's wrong?
I left Jon.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I'm here. I just...
I don't know anybody else.
I don't know anybody except for goddamn superheroes.
that's okay.
you probably just had an argument or something.
no, Dan.
you don't know what it's been like living with him.
the way he looks at things now, it's like he doesn't...
...remember what they are.
it's like this world, this real world...
...to him, it's like walking through mist.
and people are just shadows.
shadows in a fog.
God, how did everything get so tangled up?
I'm sorry, Dan.
this is twice now I've ruined your evening.
come on. I'm glad you came over.
I was just gonna see Hollis for our weekly beer session.
you're more than welcome to join.
in fact, I insist.
terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me.
he just- -We don't have time for makeup.
that blue is too light for television.
is that dark enough?
Yeah, that's dark enough.
Seymour. Bernie, how's tricks?
see this guy behind me? Been bugging me all week.
girl. What we got here?
here's a list of Pentagon-approved no-go areas.
afghanistan will obviously come up, but just play it cool...
...and try not to get into any tight corners. ozymandias ...a renowned nuclear physicist, who, through a terrible accident...
...was gifted with extraordinary powers, capable of bending matter to his will.
today, the world knows him as Dr. Manhattan.
welcome.
thank you.
that's right.
ms. Black, you have the first question.
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...
...the Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face...
...analogizing humankind's proximity to extinction...
...midnight representing the threat of nuclear war.
as of now, it stands at four minutes to midnight.
would you agree that we're that close to annihilation?
my father was a watchmaker.
he abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time is relative.
I would only agree that a symbolic clock...
...is as nourishing to the intellect...
...as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man.
so you're saying there is no danger.
even in a world without nuclear weapons, there would still be danger.
and would you say, as so many claim...
...that you are, in fact, a god...
...given you see the past and future simultaneously?
I can only see my own past...
...my own future. I am not omniscient.
Doug Roth, your question?
speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...
...do you remember a man named Wally Weaver?
Yes. We were both physicists together at the Gila Flats Research Base.
he died of cancer.
he was a good man. How about Edgar Jacobi...
...also known as the supervillain Moloch?
you encountered him several times in the '60s: battles, conflicts.
did you know that he has cancer as well?
I wasn't told.
and what about General Anthony Randolph?
he was your handler when you first started working for the government.
cancer.
you're suggesting I was the cause.
from where I'm standing, it's starting to look pretty conclusive.
even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.
a live human body and a deceased human body...
...have the same number of particles.
structurally, there's no difference.
all right. Let's settle down, please.
what about Janey Slater?
you think it makes a difference to her?
Janey?
your ex-girlfriend?
she was a physicist too. You saw each other for 11 years.
Doug, one question at a time.
she has cancer as well. Doctors have given her six months.
isn't that right, Miss Slater?
you were the world to me, Jon.
you were my whole life.
do you remember how many times you said you loved me?
Janey, I wasn't told.
I stuck by you after the accident. I gave you everything.
this is how you repay me?
Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know. -Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.
Janey, wait.
that's it. This interview is over. Get up there.
get those cameras off. Everybody back off.
everybody back off. I need some backup here. Leave him alone.
please, if everyone would just go away...
...and leave me alone...
do you care to comment?
I said, leave me alone!
I am looking at the stars.
they're so far away...
...and their light takes so long to reach us...
...all we ever see of stars are their old photographs.
it is July, 1959, and I am in love.
that's great.
you can pick it up tomorrow. -Okay.
seventy-five cents. -Okay, thank you.
thank you.
gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice. I'm sure I made a face.
Oh, no, no. I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.
her name is Janey Slater.
she is a physicist, like me.
I am 30 years old.
we were introduced by a good friend of mine from college, Wally Weaver.
it is February 12th, 1981.
Wally dies of cancer, of which they now say I am the cause.
that night, Janey and I make love for the first time.
a month from now, the accident awaits me.
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys. I think I left my watch inside.
Hey. Let's just wait a second.
I cross the room to the Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.
when I get to the door...
...Wally is turning white.
the program's locked in. We can't override the time lock.
I am terrified.
Jon?
I'm sorry, Jon...
...but I can't...
Janey, don't leave me!
don't leave me!
it is May 12th, 1959, when I'm introduced to Janey.
she buys me a beer...
...the first time a woman has done this for me.
as she passes me the cold, perspiring glass...
...our fingers touch.
Yes, Jon, good.
now it's just a question of reassembling the components in the correct sequence.
I feel fear...
...for the last time.
a token funeral is held.
there is nothing to bury.
Janey frames the snapshot.
it's the only photograph of me anyone has.
a circulatory system is seen by the perimeter fence.
a few days later...
...a partially muscled skeleton stands in a hallway...
...and screams for a moment before vanishing.
Oh, God.
Jon?
is that you?
nations around the world reeling from this morning's announcement...
...possibly the most significant event in recent history.
we repeat, the superman exists, and he is American.
they call me Dr. Manhattan.
they explain the name has been chosen...
...for the ominous associations it will raise in America's enemies.
they are shaping me into something gaudy...
...something lethal.
in January, 1971...
...President Nixon asks me to intervene in Vietnam...
...something that his predecessors would not ask.
a week later, the conflict ends.
some of the Vietcong forces wanna surrender to me personally.
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero, writes a book.
in it, he calls my arrival the dawn of the superhero.
I am not sure if I know what that means.
you see, at the time, I was misquoted.
I never said, "The superman exists and he is American."
what I said was, "God exists, and he is American."
now, if you begin to feel an intense...
...and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept...
...don't be alarmed.
that indicates only that you are still sane.
it is Christmas, 1963.
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.
she says I am like a god now.
I tell her I don't think there is a God...
...and if there is, I'm nothing like him.
I tell her I still want her...
...and that I always will.
as I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.
I am in a room full of people wearing disguises.
a very young girl looks at me and smiles.
she's beautiful.
after each long kiss, she plants a smaller, gentler one upon my lips...
...like a signature.
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.
she bursts into angry tears, asking if it's because she's getting older.
it's true.
she's aging more noticeably every day...
...while I am standing still.
I prefer the stillness here.
I am tired of Earth.
these people.
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.
they claim their labors are to build a heaven...
...yet their heaven is populated with horrors.
perhaps the world is not made.
perhaps nothing is made.
a clock without a craftsman.
it's too late.
always has been...
...always will be...
...too late.
Mr. President...
...the Soviets have moved their tanks to just short of the Afghan border.
they are testing us...
...to see if we manufactured Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...
...to coax a move out of them.
how soon can we be ready for a preemptive strike?
two days.
we have a 54 percent chance of wiping out the entire U. S.S. R...
...before they get their missiles airborne.
assuming conservative projections...
...of how many Soviet warheads we destroy beforehand...
...We'll lose all of the East Coast.
the last gasp...
...of the Harvard establishment.
let's see them think their way out of fission.
with anticipated wind patterns, the fallout drift would head south.
mexico would catch the worst of it.
most of the farm belt might remain unaffected.
not so bad...
...all things considered.
Mr. President...
...what would you like to do?
take us to DEFCON two.
begin fueling the bombers.
Dr. Manhattan has two days.
after that...
...humanity is in the hands of a higher authority than mine.
let's just hope he's on our side.
without Dr. Manhattan around...
...to bully the Russians into peace, Mr. Veidt...
...people are going to need good, old-fashioned energy to rely on.
you can understand.
the world can't just quit on oil and nuclear power cold turkey.
you'll dismantle our entire economy overnight.
you're right, Lee. And why free energy?
well, "free" is just another word for "socialist."
we might have to make a public inquiry...
...into any past communist affiliations you might have had.
Mr. Lacocca, gentlemen...
...I respect your position...
...and what you've accomplished as captains of industry. I do.
you wanna know my past? Hm?
okay. Happily.
it's a matter of public record that by 17, both my parents were dead...
...leaving me alone.
I guess you could say I've always been alone.
they say I'm the smartest man in the world, but the truth is I've often felt stupid...
...at being unable to relate to anyone.
well, anyone living, that is.
the only person with whom I felt kinship...
...died 300 years before the birth of Christ.
alexander of Macedonia, or Alexander the Great, as you know him.
his vision of a united world was...
well, it was unprecedented.
I wanted...
...needed to match his accomplishments...
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's teachings to our world today.
and so began my path to conquest.
conquest not of men...
...but of the evils that beset them.
fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...
...are like a drug, and you, along with foreign interests...
...are the pushers. -Now, listen.
no.
you listen.
the world will survive...
...and it deserves more than you've been able to provide.
so let's cut to it, shall we?
I'm worth more than all of your corporations combined.
I could buy and sell you, something you should factor into your decision...
...should you choose to make our disagreement public.
I think you know the way out.
gentlemen.
the toy people wanna talk to you about new villains for the Ozymandias line.
seems all the old villains are dead. -Mr. Veidt?
I think I have some ideas. -Mr. Veidt?
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
he's got a poison capsule.
don't bite down, you son of a bitch. Who sent you? I want a name.
give me a name!
suicide pill.
potassium cyanide. Guy was dead before he hit the ground.
Thanks, hon.
then Rorschach was right.
this wasn't some lone nut.
it's an organization: well-funded, well-equipped.
but who'd wanna kill us now?
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.
so no word from Jon?
no.
well, listen...
...why don't you come stay with me?
Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor.
I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there.
okay.
Rorschach's journal, October 21 st, 1985.
on 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.
they didn't know me without my mask.
an affair?
did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile...
...make room for Dreiberg?
does Manhattan even have a heart to break?
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess.
at his apartment, I found clues.
seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational.
I've seen the logo before...
...at Moloch's.
someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch.
guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.
more than a just delivery service, I take it.
last time I was here, I saw a pension check written from the same company.
I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead.
now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach.
this is the police. We know you're in there.
no. No!
if there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed.
no. No, no, no!
framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
never, never surrender.
all right. I hope you're ready, hero.
when you are.
one...
...two...
...three.
come on.
son of a bitch.
Christ, he stinks. -Get that mask off him.
I got it. -No. No!
my face! Give me back my face!
the masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended...
...and identified as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.
little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder...
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx.
police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze...
...during the violent course of the capture.
Rorschach!
I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother!
come on out, Rorschach!
Walter Kovacs.
is that your name? Walter?
well, let me explain your situation here, Walter.
you cooperate with me...
...and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically.
in a hospital. I believe that would be good for you.
but the authorities wanna put you with the general population.
prison's a prison. -Uh-huh. Yes.
but the difference is, down there...
...you'd be eaten alive.
you're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter.
tell me what you see.
a pretty butterfly.
what about now? What do you see here?
mom?
is he hurting you?
you got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home.
bastard. I should have had that abortion.
some nice flowers.
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.
did you catch any diseases from her?
huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar?
clouds.
tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter?
you keep calling me Walter. I don't like you.
you don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly?
you're fat.
wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.
you wanna know about Rorschach?
I'll tell you about Rorschach.
I was investigating a kidnap case.
blaire Roche.
six-year-old girl. I was young then.
too soft on criminals.
I let them live.
broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.
I knew the girl was here...
...but when I searched the place, I saw nothing.
and then I found her.
it was dark when the murderer got back.
as dark as it gets.
Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it?
who is it?
what? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?
what the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man!
you think I had something to do with that girl? I found that.
what evidence have you got? That's nothing.
okay. I confess.
I kidnapped her. I killed her.
arrest me.
what? Arrest me!
I did it! I said I did it!
Christ.
look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help.
no, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No!
men get arrested.
dogs get put down.
tremors of impact shook my arm.
warm blood splashed my face.
whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl.
from then on, there was only Rorschach.
see, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.
fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.
if God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind.
from then on, I knew:
God doesn't make the world this way.
we do.
Hey, Rorschach.
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?
rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore.
Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too.
ain't that right? That's right. That's right.
maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy?
none of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you.
all right, that's it!
you're locked in here with me.
Laurie!
shit.
hold on. -Fuck.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm so sorry. I was snooping and must have hit the wrong button.
are you hurt? -No, no.
okay. -I'm fine. I just feel so bad.
no, don't worry.
it's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77.
Archie survived that.
Archie?
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...
...Merlin's pet owl.
stupid nickname.
how did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway?
well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died...
...which always surprised me. I mean, he was...
I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting...
...instead of following him.
guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and...
must be nice having a secret identity.
a secret place that nobody knows about.
you can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you.
nobody watching you.
wanna try those on?
there we go.
wow, these rock.
they amplify the spectral range.
thermal imaging.
they work even better in the dark.
you can see me, right?
I can see everything.
I remember, no matter how black it got...
...whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day.
this must be the way Jon sees the world.
we should probably head up. Food's getting cold.
put those away when you're done.
Soviets are finding themselves bogged down...
...in bloody house-to-house fighting.
casualties on both sides are said to be in the hundreds.
civilian deaths are also alarmingly high.
Dan.
jon sees a lot of things...
...but he doesn't see me.
well, uh...
Oh.
sorry.
come here.
what's the matter?
if you could just move a little... -Okay.
Yeah. There you go.
soviet ambassador to the U. N. had no comment...
...when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...
...has fueled Soviet aggression in Afghanistan.
Dan, what's wrong?
sorry, I...
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.
Oh, hell.
it's been a long time, Rorschach.
big Figure.
small world.
I like that.
but you know, it is a small world in here.
and I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd?
almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.
that's right.
fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away.
so...
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute.
you know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away.
I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you.
this place is gonna explode!
then, you die by inches.
tall order.
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.
relax, Lawrence. Soon.
come on.
Dan?
is everything all right?
I'm tired of being afraid.
afraid of war...
...afraid of the mask killer...
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...
...and how much I need it.
me too.
so to hell with it.
let's take Archie out.
you're serious.
I used to be a masked avenger too, remember?
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid.
rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner.
let's go.
I can see it. All right, hold on.
Dan, there are kids in there.
everyone, stay where you are and remain calm.
we're gonna get you out of there.
the roof's starting to cave. Get me in there.
I'm gonna get you close.
let's go.
watch your step. All right.
we're all set.
is that everyone?
Bye. Bye!
I can't believe we did that.
they'll lock us up with Rorschach. -Who cares?
world War llI could start tomorrow.
right?
right.
come back here!
he's dead, Rorschach.
while everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift.
something from the machine shop.
Hey, boss, you notice?
none of that "small world, tall order" crap.
he knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block.
fat chance.
you're dead, Rorschach!
we got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got?
your hands, my pleasure.
can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
this riot won't last. I been waiting 15 years for this.
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge.
nothing personal, big guy.
boss! Wait!
now you find out what the score is.
One-nothing. Come and get me.
come on.
so I've been thinking.
I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity -I think we ought to spring Rorschach. What?
someone set him up.
and this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense.
you didn't get it.
Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison...
...is a little different than putting out a fire. -Yeah, you're right.
it'll be more fun.
hurry, Lloyd. I wanna smell this son of a bitch cooking.
Yes.
no.
never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really.
Two-nothing. Your move.
get out of the way!
no. No.
Where's my face?
don't kill me.
your turn, doctor.
tell me, what do you see?
don't move!
Rorschach.
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.
excuse me. Have to visit men's room.
Oh, for chrissake.
are you all right?
Yeah. Just...
...heavy, you know?
war, jailbreak.
don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Hello, Laurie. -Jon.
TV said you were on Mars. -I am on Mars.
you and I are about to have a conversation there.
what are you talking about?
you're going to try to convince me to save the world.
Laurie, don't. -Dan, trust me.
I have to go.
beautiful, isn't it?
forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind.
it won't happen again.
that's comforting.
Oh, my God.
I'm on Mars.
we need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people.
sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book?
you forgot how we do things, Daniel.
you've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women.
okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.
God, who do you think you are, Rorschach?
you live off people while insulting them...
...and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that, man.
Daniel...
...you are a good friend.
I know it can be difficult with me sometimes.
forget it.
it's okay, man.
let's do it your way.
Oh, God.
pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it?
Oh, you bastards.
I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this?
back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face.
everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief.
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him?
no.
Yeah, yeah!
I hired him. I knew him from the inside. -You're a felon.
I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear.
I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life.
told by whom? -My contact, Miss Slater.
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program.
give people a second chance. God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.
Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid.
follow the money.
this is where we hold our conversation.
in it, you ask me to stop the imminent nuclear war.
but why would I save a world...
...I no longer have any stake in?
then do it for me.
if you really care.
when you left me, I left Earth.
does that not show you that I care?
my red world here, now...
...means more to me than your blue one.
let me show you.
bombers are fueled and ready, sir.
it's time, gentlemen.
take us to DEFCON one.
not in penthouse. Not in office.
what nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything...
...out into the night at this hour?
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.
maybe he keeps on file.
something's not right. -Agreed.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it.
whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer.
setting Manhattan up.
funny.
ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world.
believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars.
must currently be holding breath in anticipation.
Pharaohs?
got a psych profile on Manhattan.
see what the corporate head-peepers say.
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
if the only remaining ties were to be severed...
...we predict total detachment from the human condition."
I'm in.
no.
congratulations, Mr. Veidt. Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.
your support and your enthusiasm...
...is what has led to this triumph.
on behalf of the research team, we salute you.
Cheers. -Cheers.
what in life does not deserve celebrating?
this is the new Karnak.
this represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old...
...a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance.
and for this...
...I am ashamed...
...ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward.
to the pharaohs...
...their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants...
...buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers.
sleep well, gentlemen.
our new, peaceful world will be indebted...
...to your great sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.
Veidt's behind everything.
Why?
what's his endgame?
I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent.
used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet.
he could kill us both alone in the snow.
that's where we're going now: Antarctica.
whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading...
...I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you.
I live my life free of compromise...
...and step into the shadow without complaint or regret.
rorschach, November 1 st.
can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble?
it ends with you in tears.
tears? So you don't come back to Earth.
at some point, yes.
the streets are filled with death.
Jon, please.
you have to stop this. Everyone will die.
and the universe will not even notice.
in my opinion, the existence of life...
...is a highly overrated phenomenon.
just look around you.
mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism.
here, it's a constantly changing topographical map...
...flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 10, 000 years wide.
so tell me...
...how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?
by a shopping mall?
so it's too much to ask for a miracle?
miracles, by their definition, are meaningless.
Oh, God, Jon!
only what can happen does happen. -Just stop your bullshit.
land this thing. Now.
as you wish.
you know what?
you can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom...
...and all the other worthless humans.
but know that you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears...
...and look: nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything.
you complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms...
...yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective.
you shut out what you're afraid of. -I'm not afraid.
you want me to see things your way? Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?
I put food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
even the grimy parts of it...
...keep on getting brighter.
you're Sally Jupiter's kid.
you're the Comedian, right?
you were pretty cool in there.
you know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.
you got her eyes, you know. You got- -Take your hands off her.
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.
now.
are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his...
...you know, old friend's daughter?
drive.
it was a mistake. One time.
guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job?
what? Were you drunk or just lonely?
am I ever gonna live this down?
Laurie.
no.
no, not him.
the Comedian...
...was your father.
no.
No! No! No!
my life is just...
...one big joke.
I don't think your life is a joke.
Yeah, well...
...I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.
will you smile...
...if I admit I was wrong?
about what?
miracles.
events with astronomical odds of occurring...
...like oxygen turning into gold.
I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect...
...that in human coupling...
...millions upon millions of cells compete to create life...
...for generation after generation...
...until finally, your mother...
...loves a man...
...Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate...
...and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds...
...It's you...
only...
...you.
...that emerged.
to distill so specific a form...
...from all that chaos...
...is like turning air into gold.
a miracle.
and so...
...I was wrong.
now dry your eyes, and let's go home.
we got a bearing on that artificial structure. Heat signature's off the charts.
Veidt. -I don't like the way Archie's kicking.
the engines. -They're icing up. Hold onto something.
Daniel, you're coming in too low.
don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply...
I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!
I'm gonna redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing...
...but it's gonna take a while and we don't have time to wait.
you need something warmer.
fine like this.
what is it, girl?
Mm.
Adrian's a pacifist.
he's a vegetarian, for chrissakes. He's never killed anyone in his life.
Hitler was vegetarian.
you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance.
gentlemen.
welcome. -Adrian, we know everything.
then what's there to discuss, Dan?
plenty. You killed Comedian.
may he rest in peace.
Blake figured it out first.
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat.
Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak...
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly.
even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart.
so...
...I had to kill him.
then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.
I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research...
...to block Jon's vision of the future.
you used his psych profile to manipulate him.
got him to leave the planet.
I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion.
his subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me...
...he might as well have been sobbing.
all I needed to do was tug on the thread.
the sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...
...when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved...
...was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth.
your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off.
Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan.
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...
...leaving only one loose end:
you, and your mask-killer theory...
...one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath.
I tipped off the police.
once you were in prison, I was able to move forward.
sorry to disappoint you.
we were supposed to make the world a better place.
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.
nuclear war?
human extinction?
of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.
a few key regions around the globe...
new York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong.
...disintegrated in an instant.
fifteen million people killed...
...By Dr. Manhattan himself.
the world's punishment for flirting with World War III.
jon wouldn't do that.
a fact no one outside this room ever has to know.
the energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition.
all these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power...
...unaware of how I planned to use it.
you see...
...the Comedian was right.
humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation.
so in order to save this planet...
...I had to trick it...
...with the greatest practical joke in human history.
killing millions. -To save billions.
a necessary crime.
you know we can't let you do that.
do that," Rorschach?
I'm not a comic-book villain.
do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you...
...if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome?
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Henry.
why the hell didn't we get a launch detection?
it's not the Soviets, sir.
intel indicates the energy signature...
...was generated by...
...Dr. Manhattan.
Jon.
interference.
cataclysmic interference.
I can't believe it happened.
this wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.
it was me.
I...
...did this.
what do you mean, you did this? -Not directly.
it was made to look like I did it.
Adrian.
speak of the devil.
Jon- I know.
must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions.
wait here.
Adrian, stop this.
the tachyons were clever...
...but even if I can't predict where you are, I can turn the walls to glass.
I should thank you.
I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing...
...the delights of uncertainty.
forgive me, girl.
you're such an asshole.
Veidt, you bastard.
if you've hurt her, I'Il- -Dan...
...grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism.
your...
...schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved?
failing to prevent Earth's salvation...
...is your only triumph.
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.
I'm very disappointed.
reassembling myself was the first trick I learned.
it didn't kill Osterman.
did you really think it would kill me?
I have walked across the surface of the sun.
I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast...
...they can hardly be said to have occurred at all...
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.
the world's smartest man...
...poses no more threat to me...
...than does its smartest termite.
what's that?
another ultimate weapon?
Yes.
you could say that.
...came under attack.
millions of lives were suddenly ended...
...in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.
since the attacks, I have been in constant contact...
...with the premier of the U. S.S. R.
putting aside our past differences...
...we have both pledged to unite...
...against this common enemy.
with the rest of the world...
...we will prevail.
this is a day we shall never forget.
and yet we go forward to defend the human race...
...and all that is good and just in our world.
thank you. God bless us all.
do you see?
two superpowers retreating from war.
I've saved the earth from hell.
we both have.
this is as much your victory as it is mine.
now we can return...
...do what we were meant to.
we were meant to exact justice.
everyone's gonna know what you've done. -Will they?
by exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
peace based on a lie. -But peace...
...nonetheless. -He's right.
exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
no. We can't do this.
on Mars...
...you taught me the value of life.
if we hope to preserve it here...
...we must remain silent.
keep your own secrets.
don't even think about it.
Rorschach.
wait.
never compromise.
not even in the face of armageddon.
that's always been the difference between us, Daniel.
I've made myself feel every death...
...see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
you understand, don't you? Without condoning...
...or condemning...
...I understand.
out of my way. People have to be told.
you know I can't let you do that.
suddenly you discover humanity?
convenient.
if you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened.
I can change almost anything...
...but I can't change human nature.
of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia.
what's one more body amongst foundations?
well, what are you waiting for?
do it.
do it!
No!
I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated.
I thought you said you cared about life again.
I do.
I think maybe I'll create some.
goodbye, Laurie.
come on.
come on!
Dan...
...a world united and at peace.
there had to be sacrifice.
No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it.
you've mutilated it.
that's your legacy.
that's the real practical joke.
we repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.
you are about to participate in a great adventure.
you are about to experience the awe and mystery...
...which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.
sure you don't want a drink?
I'm okay.
Cheers.
there's something I need to get off my chest.
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.
Laurel.
what you must think of me.
I'm sorry I never told you.
I should have...
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.
it doesn't matter.
people's lives take them strange places. They do strange things...
...and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them.
I know how that is...
...but I just want you to know...
...that you never did anything wrong by me.
you asked me why I wasn't mad at him.
because he gave me you.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.
Hello, Miss Jupiter. -Oh, Sally, please.
excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back.
so how's it going up here? -Good. How's it going down there?
good. I think I've got everything working.
all of Archie's systems are upgraded. Finished the tinkering for now...
...so all we gotta do is take her out.
well, that sounds like a date.
are we gonna be all right?
long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right...
...in the end.
I know what Jon would say:
nothing ends.
nothing ever ends.
seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore.
everyone in the country...
...every country in the world are holding hands...
...and singing songs about peace and love.
it's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune.
well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88.
we could run a piece on that.
seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage.
this is still America, damn it. Who wants a cowboy in the White House?
okay. I could look for something in the crank file.
crank file.
whatever. Take some initiative.
run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands.
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
the United States' lack of action in Eastern Europe...
...proves that the Soviet Union's aggression at the Afghan border...
... will not be opposed publicly by the United States.
issue: The Soviet Union continued its recent series of military exercises...
...conducting a bomb test today in the Bering Sea just 1500 miles off the southern coast of Alaska.
president Richard Nixon issued this warning to the Soviets:
the United States does not start fights.
let it be clear we maintain our strength...
...in order to maintain peace...
...so any adversary should ask themselves:
do the consequences of attacking America...
...outweigh the potential benefits?
as a result of the Soviet activity...
...the watchdog group of nuclear scientists...
...moved the Doomsday Clock up to five minutes until midnight:
destruction by nuclear war.
question:
on a scale of zero to 10, zero meaning impossibility...
... 10 meaning complete metaphysical certitude...
...what are the chances the Russians will actually attack the United States?
pat Buchanan.
the Soviets would never risk going to war...
...when we have a walking nuclear deterrent on our side.
you're referring, of course, to Dr. Manhattan...
...but does Dr. Manhattan's existence guarantee world peace? Eleanor Clift.
well, it hasn't stopped the Soviet Union...
...from stockpiling record amounts of nuclear weapons.
you don't think it's just posturing?
maybe the reason why the Soviets...
...are doing these bomb tests...
...is because they feel threatened by Dr. Manhattan. Of course.
maybe the whole world feels like that.
soviet ships have violated the territorial waters.
just a matter of time, I suppose.
it's a joke. It's all a joke.
mother, forgive me.
I was a hero, goddamn it!
...an act clearly meant to send a signal to the government in Saigon...
...that violence and oppression is not the way to peace.
fuck you, pigs!
good luck, Mr. Gorsky.
get out of here, vigilantes!
No!
edward Blake. Sixty-seven years old. Six-two, a solid 225.
guy was built like a linebacker.
Yeah, I saw the body.
for a guy his age, he was in terrific shape.
you mean apart from being dead?
that's plate glass.
you'd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in it.
had to have been thrown.
check the bedroom?
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.
mattress flipped. Probably robbery.
or made to look like one.
see this?
shaking hands with the president. Whoa.
think Blake was a spook?
government or black ops?
I think...
...this is way bigger than both of us.
Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.
dog carcass in alley this morning. Tire tread on burst stomach.
this city's afraid of me.
I've seen its true face. The streets are extended gutters...
...and the gutters are full of blood.
and when the drains finally scab over...
...all the vermin will drown.
the accumulated filth of all their sex and murder...
... will foam up around their waists...
...and all the whores and politicians will look up and shout, "Save us."
and I'll whisper, "No."
now the whole world stands on the brink...
...staring down into bloody hell.
all those liberals and intellectuals...
...and smooth talkers...
...and all of a sudden, nobody can think of anything to say.
beneath me, this awful city.
it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children...
...and the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
somebody knows why.
somebody knows.
no, I definitely heard something.
watch the door.
Shh.
must've been the wind. Next time you...
it all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.
pirate outfits, ghosts.
they thought it was funny: dress up and pull heists.
as soon as we'd arrest them, they'd be back on the street.
nobody could pick them out of a lineup because of the damn masks.
so a few of us cops, we get together...
...and we figure, what the heck, we'll mask up, too.
we'll finish what the law couldn't.
pretty soon, the papers get wind of it. They ran with it...
...and oh, boy, we're a national pastime.
it was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman...
...Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice...
...Silk Spectre and the Comedian.
Oh, don't get me started on him.
I must be drunk already, telling you this sob story again.
I think you were trying to make a point.
well, my point is that we had it too easy. It wasn't fair what happened to you guys.
you guys who picked up where we left off, with Nixon forcing you out.
Nixon, oh, that prick. To think I voted for that prick five times.
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight. Gotta go.
truth?
you were a better Nite Owl than I ever was, Danny boy.
Hollis, we both know that's bullshit. -Hey.
watch it with the language.
this is the left hook that floored Captain Axis, remember?
Yeah. -This just in:
the masked vigilante known as Rorschach...
...has assaulted a police officer in the early-morning hours.
rorschach is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list...
...for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes six years ago.
rorschach reportedly incapacitated...
forced everyone out except him.
Oh, he'll quit.
when he's dead.
next week? -Well...
...you know, you don't have to keep humoring me like this.
if you got a hot date or something...
Hey, us retired guys have to stick together, right?
you ever miss it?
no. You?
Oh, heck, no.
be seeing you.
Hello, Daniel.
Rorschach.
helped myself to some beans. Hope you don't mind.
no, no. Course not.
you want me to heat those up for you?
fine like this.
how have you been keeping?
out of prison.
heard about you on the news.
say you attacked a cop.
minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.
Daniel...
...Iook at this.
is this bean juice? -Human bean juice.
badge belonged to the Comedian. Blood too. He's dead.
let's talk downstairs.
it could have been a burglary.
maybe the killer didn't know who the Comedian was.
an ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.
I heard he'd been working for the government since '77...
...knocking over Marxist republics in South America.
maybe it was a political killing or something.
maybe.
maybe someone's picking off costumed heroes.
you don't think that's a little paranoid?
that what they say about me now?
paranoid?
look, Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years...
...even among his friends.
speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?
he wrote that book. Said some bad things about the Comedian in it.
I don't like what you're implying, and I like being followed even less.
maybe I was keeping an eye on you, in case someone's gunning for masks.
you were never that sentimental. -Attack on one is attack on all of us.
what do you suggest we do about it?
retribution.
watchmen are over. -Says Tricky Dick.
says me.
nobody knows who you are.
you can give it up, try and have a normal life.
that what you have now? A normal life?
when you walk down the street in a city dying of rabies...
...past the human cockroaches...
...talking about their heroin and child pornography...
...do you really feel normal?
least I'm not the one still hiding behind a mask.
no.
you're hiding in plain sight.
be seeing you, Dan.
a maintenance hatch will let you out two blocks north.
Yeah, I remember.
came here often, when we were partners.
those were great times, huh, Rorschach?
what happened? -You quit.
Rorschach's journal.
first visit of evening fruitless.
feel slightly depressed.
soon there will be war.
millions will perish in sickness and misery.
why does one death matter against so many?
because there is good and evil, and evil must be punished.
even in the face of armageddon...
...I will not compromise in this.
Mr. Veidt...
...to date, you're one of only two Watchmen...
...ever to reveal their true identity to the world...
...the first being Hollis Mason.
and you've certainly profited greatly by it...
...turning your superhero alter ego, Ozymandias, into a billion-dollar industry:
toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.
I understand there's a movie in the works.
I'm not hearing a question, Mr. Roth. -I'm sorry. Do you think...
the Watchmen resent me for prostituting their struggle?
it's a fair question. Yes, it's crossed my mind...
...some of my old colleagues might see it that way...
...just as you're clearly aware that biased journalism...
...sells more magazines.
the merchandising arm of Veidt lndustries is funding our work with Dr. Manhattan.
we recently expanded our research facility in Antarctica...
...in the hope of developing cheap, renewable sources of energy...
...that might eliminate the world's reliance on fossil fuels.
now, it doesn't take a political scientist...
...to see that our Cold War with the Russians isn't ideological...
...It's based upon fear. Fear of not having enough.
but if we make resources infinite...
...ah...
...we make war obsolete.
I would hope the other Watchmen understand that...
...wherever they may be.
thanks for your time.
you look good, Adrian. -Dan.
it's been too long.
so Rorschach thinks someone's hunting the Watchmen, huh?
you think it's possible?
statistically, one murder doesn't equal a trend.
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.
and so was the Comedian. He was practically a Nazi.
you know that better than anyone.
I'm not here because I miss him.
it's occurred to Rorschach...
...that we're the only ones who know each other's identities.
actually, the whole world knows yours.
that's why I'm warning you first.
thank you, Dan...
...but I fear there's something much more real to worry about than Rorschach's mask killer.
if the Russians do launch their nukes, can Jon really stop them?
the Soviets have 51, 000 warheads stockpiled.
even if Jon stops 99 percent of them...
...the 1 percent that get through could still kill every living thing on Earth.
even Dr. Manhattan can't be everywhere at once.
Rorschach's journal, October 13th, 1985...
...8: 30 p. m.
meeting with Dreiberg left bad taste in mouth.
a flabby failure who sits whimpering in his basement.
why are so few of us left active...
...healthy and without personality disorders?
the first Nite Owl runs an auto-repair shop.
the first Silk Spectre is a bloated, aging whore...
...dying in a California rest resort.
dollar Bill got his cape stuck in a revolving door...
... where he got gunned down.
silhouette, murdered...
...a victim of her own indecent lifestyle.
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.
even Adrian Veidt, possible homosexual.
must investigate further.
only two names remain on my list.
both share private quarters at Rockefeller Military Research Center.
I shall go to them.
I shall go tell the indestructible man that someone plans to murder him.
good evening, Rorschach.
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.
yes...
...but you're going to leave disappointed.
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here. You're a wanted man.
nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.
I have a real name I've been using.
try it.
whatever you say, Laurie.
what are you doing here?
the Comedian is dead.
rorschach wants me to look into my future...
...see if the killer is ever publicly identified.
already warned Dreiberg. Came to warn you too.
even if I wanted to help...
...my future is blocked by some kind of temporal interference.
I cannot see it clearly. -lnterference? Caused by what?
in all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.
if the United States and Soviet Union engage in all-out war...
...the resulting blast wave would produce a sudden burst of tachyons...
...particles which travel backward through what you perceive as time...
...therefore obscuring my vision of the present.
I must return to my work.
wait a minute.
what if that's why someone wants us out of the way?
so we can't do anything to stop it?
goodbye, Rorschach.
took a lot of effort to get in here to see you.
I'm not leaving till I've had my say.
seems like there's a lot of things you don't tell me these days.
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.
if Adrian and I can solve the energy crisis, war may be averted.
but you always say time is simultaneous.
if that's true, then how can you change the future?
if only you could perceive time as I do.
please let me show you.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?
I'm putting food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
lt was a mistake. One time. -Man tries to rape you.
stop!
your mind goes to dark places...
...and you wonder why I keep the worst from you.
say hello to Dan for me. -What?
you wanna ask me to go to dinner with you...
...Iike we used to...
...but you won't.
you know I can't.
so you'll call Dan...
...which is only natural.
you deserve the comfort of an old friend.
Dan Dreiberg's table.
did you know that he and H. J. were... I had no idea.
you remember that crazy guy? What'd he call himself?
captain Carnage.
used to pretend he was a supervillain just so he could get beat up?
Yeah, he tried that on me once. I just walked away.
he starts following me down the street in broad daylight...
...yelling, "Punish me! Punish me!"
I'm just saying, "No, get lost."
God, whatever happened to him?
Oh. Um... He pulled that on Rorschach...
...and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Oh, my God. That's not even funny.
it's a little funny. -Yep.
I'm glad I ordered the four-legged chicken.
it's really good to see you again.
it's great seeing you too.
why'd we do it, Dan? Dress up like that?
no one else would. -Yeah, but do you remember my costume?
all that tight latex? I mean, it was awful.
uh... Yeah, yeah, awful.
but didn't wanna disappoint Mother.
wanted her little girl to be just like her and fight bad guys.
I think the Keene Act was the best thing that ever happened to us.
well, we'll live longer anyway.
what?
jon thinks, unless he can do something about it...
...that there's gonna be nuclear war.
soon.
but I don't know what to think. I mean, it's all...
...quantum mechanics and parallel realities with him.
I never even know what universe he's actually seeing.
he just keeps getting further away from me.
everyone.
I can't even tell if he actually cares about me anymore...
...or if he's just pretending.
if he's pretending, it means he cares.
hold on, I'll get the door.
Thanks, Dan.
got it? -Yeah.
you always get a government escort to dinner?
they're making sure I don't do anything to upset the country's most powerful weapon.
I'm sorry.
I invite you out to dinner to catch up and have a few laughs...
...but there don't seem to be many laughs around these days.
what do you expect? The Comedian's dead.
Laurie? Is that you?
thought you'd be used to traveling that way by now.
well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me.
well, it beats flying coach.
margarita?
mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.
remember that guy that writes me letters?
he sent me an item of memorabilia. It's a Tijuana bible.
this little eight-page porno comic they did in the '30s and '40s.
he sent you this? -Sure. They're very valuable, like antiques.
mother, this is gross.
I think it's kind of flattering.
why do you always call me Mother when you're mad?
I know why you're here. I can still read, you know.
I saw it in the paper.
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.
finally got his punchline, I guess.
poor Eddie. -Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.
you don't know.
things change.
what happened happened 40 years ago.
I'm 67 years old.
every day, the future looks a little bit darker.
but the past...
...even the grimy parts of it...
...keep on getting brighter.
I've got spots in my eyes.
stop it, Eddie.
thank you, Weegee. -Thank you, Mr. Owl.
tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.
little place on 21 st. -Sounds good.
wow, a real photo session. Wonder how my hair will look?
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.
Eddie.
what the hell are you doing here? You knew I was changing.
sure I did.
come on, baby.
I know what you need.
you gotta have some kind of reason for dressing in an outfit like this.
I said no, Eddie.
no spelled Y-E-S. -No spelled N-O.
all right? -Come on, sweetheart.
Eddie...
you little bastard.
this what you like?
this what makes you hot? -What?
things are tough all over, cupcake.
it rains on the just and the unjust alike.
the Comedian was a little bit of both.
and he always thought he'd get the last laugh.
thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts.
shut not thy merciful ears to our prayers...
...but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty...
...O holy and merciful savior.
thou most worthy judge eternal.
suffer us not at our last hour for any...
fireworks. You gotta be kidding me.
you know, you'd think this goddamn country had had enough fireworks.
you know, if we'd lost here in Vietnam...
...I think it might have driven us crazy. You know, as a country.
but we didn't, thanks to you.
you sound bitter.
me? Bitter?
fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Mr. Eddie? -Just what I fucking needed.
the war is over now. We must talk about this baby.
there's nothing to talk about. See, I'm leaving.
I'm gonna forget about you...
...and your horrible, sweaty, little piece-of-shit country.
get the fuck out of here.
no. -Get the fuck out of here.
you will remember.
you will remember me and my country...
...forever!
my face!
Blake. Don't.
Blake!
she was pregnant...
...and you gunned her down.
that's right...
...and you know what? You watched me.
you could have turned the gun to steam, the bullets to mercury...
...the bottle into goddamn snowflakes, but you didn't, did you?
you really don't give a damn about human beings.
you're drifting out of touch, Doc.
God help us all.
medic!
most holy and merciful savior.
he cometh up and is cut down, like a flower.
in the midst of life, we are in death.
of whom may we seek succor, but of thee, O Lord?
welcome. We'll be starting shortly.
we're waiting for one more.
I told you, you wouldn't be the only one dressed up.
welcome, doctor.
now we can start.
thank you for coming. Acquaint yourselves with this map of high-crime areas.
this is all bullshit.
for a guy who calls himself the Comedian, I can never tell when you're joking.
watchmen. That's the real joke.
it didn't work 15 years ago, and it ain't gonna work now...
...because you wanna play cowboys and lndians.
maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings.
rorschach and I have made headway on the gang problem by working together.
a group this size seems like a publicity stunt. I'm not in it for the ink.
we can do so much more.
we can save this world...
...with the right leadership. -Yeah.
and that'd be you, right, Ozzy?
I mean, hell, you're the smartest man on the planet.
it doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems.
but it takes a room of morons to think they're small enough for you to handle.
you people.
you hear Moloch's back in town, get your panties all in a bunch.
you think catching him matters? -Justice matters.
justice.
justice is coming to all of us.
no matter what the fuck we do.
you know, mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time.
now we finally have the power to finish the job.
ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.
then Ozymandias here...
...will be the smartest man on the cinder.
Watchmen! Police! Police to protect the people!
attention, citizens. We are trying to maintain order.
you must clear the streets until the police strike is over.
if you could... Please, there's no need for violence.
we are trying to retain order on the streets until the police strike is over.
crawl back in your holes before you get hurt.
I got rubber bullets. -I want my rights!
you are not the law! -We want regular cops!
no more vigilantes!
my son's a police officer, you fucking faggots!
goddamn it. All right. That's how you wanna do it?
there's no need for violence.
fuck you. Fuck you!
Oh, this is getting heavy.
goddamn, I love working on American soil, Dan.
ain't had this much fun since Woodward and Bernstein.
how long can we keep this up?
congress is pushing through some new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.
our days are numbered.
until then, it's like you always say: We're society's only protection.
from what? -Are you kidding me? From themselves.
son of a bitch. -No, Comedian, wait!
get your stinking hands off me.
what the hell happened to us?
what happened to the American dream?
what happened to the American dream?
it came true!
you're looking at it.
Edgar William Jacobi.
also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as Moloch.
what are you talking about?
I'm a retired businessman.
lie again, Moloch, I break another finger.
I did my time.
I'm not Moloch anymore.
what do you want from me? -Heard you attended Blake's funeral. Why?
I just felt I should...
...pay my respects to the Comedian.
how'd you know he was the Comedian? -He broke in here. A week ago.
he had his mask off.
he was drunk. -Enemies. For decades.
why should he visit you? -I don't know.
I woke up in my bedroom and there he was.
he was upset.
he was crying.
crying? The Comedian?
he was babbling, not making any sense.
I was pissing in my pants.
I thought he was gonna kill me.
what did he say?
it's a joke.
it's all a fucking joke.
you know, I thought I knew how it was.
I thought I knew how the world was.
I've done some bad things.
I did bad things to women. I shot kids.
in 'Nam, you know.
but that was fucking war.
this...
I've never done anything like this.
God, here I am...
...spilling my guts...
...to one of my archenemies.
but the truth is...
...you're the closest thing to a friend I got. What the fuck does that say?
shit.
and your name...
...your name was on the list...
...along with Janey, you know, whatever the fuck her name is.
Manhattan's old girl.
mother, forgive me.
and then he left.
I swear I don't know what the hell he was talking about.
funny story.
sounds unbelievable.
probably true.
so that's it?
I'm clean? -You?
clean?
amygdalin.
this phony medication made from apricot pits.
it's illegal. -Come on.
please don't confiscate that.
I'm trying anything.
I have cancer.
what kind of cancer?
you know the kind you eventually get better from?
that ain't the kind I got.
Rorschach's journal. October 16th.
want some of this? Fifty bucks, I'll suck your cock.
thought about Moloch's story. -Come on.
could all be lies.
a revenge scheme planned during his years behind bars.
fuck you. I make more in a week than you make in a year, you fucking homo.
but if it's true...
... what could have possibly scared the Comedian...
...enough to cry in front of Moloch?
what was it he saw?
and that list he mentioned.
edward Blake. The Comedian.
born in 1918.
buried in the rain.
murdered.
is that what happens to us? No time for friends?
only our enemies leave roses.
violent lives ending violently.
Blake understood. Humans are savage in nature.
no matter how much you try to dress it up...
... to disguise it...
...Blake saw society's true face.
chose to be a parody of it. A joke.
I heard a joke once.
man goes to doctor, says he's depressed.
life seems harsh and cruel.
says he feels all alone in the threatening world.
doctor says treatment is simple.
the great clown Pagliacci is in town. Go see him.
that should pick you up.
man bursts into tears.
"but doctor, " he says. "I am Pagliacci."
good joke.
everybody laughs.
roll on snare drum.
curtains.
what time do you have to be at your interview?
don't worry.
we've got plenty of time.
your finger's like licking a battery.
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?
please don't be upset.
I always thought you liked this.
no.
I don't. No.
I don't want that.
I don't know what stimulates you anymore.
look, I know you were just trying...
are you working in here while we're in bed together?
my work with Adrian is at a critical stage right now.
I didn't think it was necessary to... -To what?
to what? To tell me which one of you is giving me a pity fuck?
my attention was completely focused on you.
if you think there's a problem with my attitude...
...I am prepared to discuss it.
you know how everything in this world fits together except people.
what am I to you? Another puzzle to be solved?
have your men stand back. I'm teleporting the reactor to Karnak now.
you're my only remaining link to the world.
I don't want that responsibility anymore.
he's all yours.
don't worry, Jon. She'll be back.
no, she won't.
he's been called many things: Hero, weapon...
...Iinchpin of our national security...
...deterrent to nuclear war, or a man to end worlds.
later tonight, Dr. Manhattan...
... will answer my questions and yours in an exclusive interview...
...brought to you commercial-free by Veidt Enterprises.
who is it?
it's Laurie.
sorry. I just had this new lock installed.
I didn't know where else to go.
Oh, it's okay. Come in.
what's wrong?
I left Jon.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I'm here. I just...
I don't know anybody else.
I don't know anybody except for goddamn superheroes.
that's okay.
you probably just had an argument or something.
no, Dan.
you don't know what it's been like living with him.
the way he looks at things now, it's like he doesn't...
...remember what they are.
it's like this world, this real world...
...to him, it's like walking through mist.
and people are just shadows.
shadows in a fog.
God, how did everything get so tangled up?
I'm sorry, Dan.
this is twice now I've ruined your evening.
come on. I'm glad you came over.
I was just gonna see Hollis for our weekly beer session.
you're more than welcome to join.
in fact, I insist.
terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me.
he just... -We don't have time for makeup.
that blue is too light for television.
is that dark enough?
Yeah, that's dark enough.
the weight of the world's on him, but does he quit? No.
news vendors always cope. They're the...
Oh, God, here comes that homeless guy again.
I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet.
why do you care about that right-wing rag? Those bastards don't give a damn.
hold up. Here they come.
Seymour. -Bernie, how's tricks?
fine, fine.
see this guy behind me? Been bugging me all week.
maybe we should get a cab. These are bad neighborhoods.
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.
girl. What we got here?
here's a list of Pentagon-approved no-go areas.
afghanistan will obviously come up, but just play it cool...
...and try not to get into any tight corners.
a renowned nuclear physicist, who, through a terrible accident...
...was gifted with extraordinary powers, capable of bending matter to his will.
today, the world knows him as Dr. Manhattan.
welcome.
thank you.
that's right.
ms. Black, you have the first question.
Dr. Manhattan, as you know...
...the Doomsday Clock is a symbolic clock face...
...analogizing humankind's proximity to extinction...
...midnight representing the threat of nuclear war.
as of now, it stands at four minutes to midnight.
would you agree that we're that close to annihilation?
my father was a watchmaker.
he abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time is relative.
I would only agree that a symbolic clock...
...is as nourishing to the intellect...
...as a photograph of oxygen to a drowning man.
so you're saying there is no danger.
even in a world without nuclear weapons, there would still be danger.
and would you say, as so many claim,
that you are, in fact, a god...
...given you see the past and future simultaneously?
I can only see my own past...
...my own future. I am not omniscient.
Doug Roth, your question?
speaking of your past, Dr. Manhattan...
...do you remember a man named Wally Weaver?
Yes. We were both physicists together at the Gila Flats Research Base.
he died of cancer.
he was a good man. -How about Edgar Jacobi,
also known as the supervillain Moloch?
you encountered him several times in the '60s: battles, conflicts.
did you know that he has cancer as well?
I wasn't told.
and what about General Anthony Randolph?
he was your handler when you first started working for the government.
cancer.
you're suggesting I was the cause.
from where I'm standing, it's starting to look pretty conclusive.
even if that's the case, it's irrelevant.
a live human body and a deceased human body...
...have the same number of particles.
structurally, there's no difference.
all right. Let's settle down, please.
what about Janey Slater?
you think it makes a difference to her?
Janey?
your ex-girlfriend?
she was a physicist too. You saw each other for 11 years.
Doug, one question at a time.
she has cancer as well. Doctors have given her six months.
isn't that right, Miss Slater?
you were the world to me, Jon.
you were my whole life.
do you remember how many times you said you loved me?
Janey, I wasn't told.
I stuck by you after the accident. I gave you everything.
this is how you repay me?
Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know. -Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.
Janey, wait.
that's it. This interview is over. -Get up there.
get those cameras off. Everybody back off.
everybody back off. I need some backup here. Leave him alone.
please, if everyone would just go away...
...and leave me alone...
do you care to comment?
I said, leave me alone!
Jesus.
us...
...getting mugged.
let's go.
I'm shaking.
you know what?
I'm wiped. I'm just gonna call it a night.
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna come by Hollis' with me...
...and shake off the adrenaline?
I think I've had enough hero stuff for one night.
it helped having you listen.
any time.
take care, Dan.
it's a rough world out there.
be seeing you.
you're late.
Ah, I know. I know. You won't believe what happened.
Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.
wait, what?
I was just with Laurie. She doesn't know.
she's gonna know soon enough. The whole world will know.
I said, leave me alone!
I am looking at the stars.
they're so far away...
...and their light takes so long to reach us...
...all we ever see of stars are their old photographs.
it is July, 1959, and I am in love.
that's great.
you can pick it up tomorrow. -Okay.
seventy-five cents. -Okay, thank you.
thank you.
gosh, Jon, I wish he gave us a little notice. I'm sure I made a face.
Oh, no, no. I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.
her name is Janey Slater.
she is a physicist, like me.
I was 30 years old.
we were introduced by a good friend of mine from college, Wally Weaver.
it is February 12th, 1981.
Wally dies of cancer, of which they now say I am the cause.
that night, Janey and I make love for the first time.
a month from now, the accident awaits me.
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys. I think I left my watch inside.
Hey. Let's just wait a second.
I cross the room to the Intrinsic Field Center. I find my watch.
when I get to the door...
... Wally is turning white.
the program's locked in. We can't override the time lock.
I am terrified.
Jon?
I'm sorry, Jon...
...but I can't
Janey, don't leave me!
don't leave me!
it is May 12th, 1959, when I'm introduced to Janey.
she buys me a beer...
...the first time a woman has done this for me.
as she passes me the cold, perspiring glass...
...our fingers touch.
Yes, Jon, good.
now it's just a question of reassembling the components in the correct sequence.
I feel fear for the last time.
a token funeral is held.
there is nothing to bury.
Janey frames the snapshot.
it's the only photograph of me anyone has.
a circulatory system is seen by the perimeter fence.
a few days later...
...a partially muscled skeleton stands in a hallway...
...and screams for a moment before vanishing.
Oh, God.
Jon?
is that you?
nations around the world reeling from this morning's announcement...
...possibly the most significant event in recent history.
we repeat, the superman exists, and he is American.
they call me Dr. Manhattan.
they explain the name has been chosen...
...for the ominous associations it will raise in America's enemies.
the marketing boys say I need a logo.
if I'm to have a symbol...
...it shall be one I respect.
they are shaping me into something gaudy...
...something lethal.
in January, 1971...
...President Nixon asks me to intervene in Vietnam...
...something that his predecessors would not ask.
a week later, the conflict ends.
some of the Vietcong forces wanna surrender to me personally.
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero, writes a book.
in it, he calls my arrival the dawn of the superhero.
I am not sure if I know what that means.
you see, at the time, I was misquoted.
I never said, " The superman exists and he is American."
what I said was, "God exists, and he is American."
now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept,
don't be alarmed.
that indicates only that you are still sane.
it is Christmas, 1963.
Janey tells me she is afraid, and worried.
she says I am like a god now.
I tell her I don't think there is a God.
and if there is, I'm nothing like him.
I tell her I still want her...
...and that I always will.
as I lie to her, it is September 4th, 1970.
I am in a room full of people wearing disguises.
a very young girl looks at me and smiles.
she's beautiful.
after each long kiss, she plants a smaller, gentler one upon my lips...
...Iike a signature.
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.
she bursts into angry tears, asking if it's because she's getting older.
it's true.
she's aging more noticeably every day...
...while I am standing still.
I prefer the stillness here.
I am tired of Earth.
these people.
I'm tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives.
they claim their labors are to build a heaven...
...yet their heaven is populated with horrors.
perhaps the world is not made.
perhaps nothing is made.
a clock without a craftsman.
it's too late.
always has been...
...always will be...
... too late.
and you have no idea where he would've gone.
how would I know?
probably on the other side of the world studying molecules.
our satellites have done a sweep of the planet.
there's no trace of his energy signature anywhere.
Really?
miss Jupiter, did you and Dr. Manhattan have a fight today?
none of your fucking business.
it is when you're on government payroll and you're not doing your job.
that's as close to the word "whore" as you're gonna get with me, Agent Forbes.
smoke?
my apologies, Miss Jupiter.
you know how important Dr. Manhattan is to our national security.
you can imagine our concern.
I can only imagine.
ain't nothing gonna matter once those nukes start flying. We'll all be dust.
then Ozymandias here...
...will be the smartest man on the cinder.
Laurel? Laurel Jane?
you're Sally Jupiter's kid.
you're the Comedian, right?
you were pretty cool in there.
you know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.
you got her eyes, you know. You even have that same funny little mole.
take your hands off her.
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.
are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his, you know, old friend's daughter?
I mean, what the hell do you think I am?
we found him!
we found him. -Where is he?
Mars.
Mr. President...
...the Soviets have moved their tanks just short of the Afghan border.
they are testing us...
...to see if we manufactured Dr. Manhattan's disappearance...
...to coax a move out of them.
if they realize it's not a hoax, they'll probably start with air strikes.
if they do, they'll have Afghanistan under control in a matter of days.
a watchdog group of nuclear scientists has moved the Doomsday Clock...
...to two minutes until midnight.
get this shit off the screen.
who are these assholes to say when doomsday approaches?
I say when doomsday is approaching.
now, then.
what about the rest of the Warsaw Pact countries?
Czechoslovakia, Poland and East Germany have mobilized their forces.
but no movement yet. They're playing a wait-and-see.
letting the Russians take the lead.
bold moves, Henry. That's what's needed right now.
we can't let these fuckers think we're weak.
Yes. They must fear the madman Richard Nixon.
how soon can we be ready for a preemptive strike?
two days.
we have a 54 percent chance of wiping out the entire U.S.S.R. before they get their missiles airborne.
what would our losses be?
assuming conservative projections...
...of how many Soviet warheads are destroyed beforehand...
...We'll lose all of the East Coast.
the last gasp of the Harvard establishment.
let's see them think their way out of fission.
with anticipated wind patterns, the fallout drift would head south.
mexico would catch the worst of it.
most of the farm belt might remain unaffected.
not so bad, all things considered.
Mr. President...
...what would you like to do?
take us to DEFCON two.
begin fueling the bombers.
Dr. Manhattan has two days.
after that...
...humanity is in the hands of a higher authority than mine.
let's just hope he's on our side.
there must be a way to reach him. -Excuse me.
radio transmission, space shuttles.
excuse me. -What?
I need to use the restroom.
don't you understand?
the only thing that can bring Jon back is Jon.
if he wants to find me, he will.
I've been a prisoner in my life long enough.
without Dr. Manhattan around...
...to bully the Russians into peace, Mr. Veidt...
...people are going to need good, old-fashioned energy to rely on.
you can understand.
the world can't just quit on oil and nuclear power cold turkey.
you'll dismantle our entire economy overnight.
you're right, Lee. And why free energy?
well, "free" is just another word for "socialist."
we might have to make a public inquiry...
...into any past communist affiliations you might have had.
Mr. Iacocca, gentlemen...
...I respect your position...
...and what you've accomplished as captains of industry. I do.
you wanna know my past? Hm?
okay. Happily.
it's a matter of public record that by 17, both my parents were dead...
...Ieaving me alone.
I guess you could say I've always been alone.
they say I'm the smartest man in the world, but the truth is I've often felt stupid...
...at being unable to relate to anyone.
well, anyone living, that is.
the only person with whom I felt kinship...
...died 300 years before the birth of Christ.
alexander of Macedonia, or Alexander the Great, as you know him.
his vision of a united world was...
well, it was unprecedented.
I wanted...
...needed to match his accomplishments...
...so I resolved to apply antiquity's teachings to our world today.
and so began my path to conquest.
conquest not of men...
...but of the evils that beset them.
fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power...
...are like a drug, and you, along with foreign interests...
...are the pushers. -Now, listen.
no.
you listen.
the world will survive...
...and it deserves more than you've been able to provide.
so let's cut to it, shall we?
I'm worth more than all of your corporations combined.
I could buy and sell you, something you should factor into your decision...
...should you choose to make our disagreement public.
I think you know the way out.
gentlemen.
the toy people wanna talk to you about new villains for the Ozymandias line.
seems all the old villains are dead. -Mr. Veidt?
I think I have some ideas. -Mr. Veidt?
I think we got off on the wrong foot.
he's got a poison capsule.
don't bite down, you son of a bitch. Who sent you? I want a name.
give me a name!
suicide pill.
potassium cyanide. Guy was dead before he hit the ground.
Thanks, hon.
then Rorschach was right.
this wasn't some lone nut.
it's an organization: well-funded, well-equipped.
but who'd wanna kill us now?
I don't know, but it's not safe out here.
so no word from Jon?
no.
well, listen...
...why don't you come stay with me?
Oh, no. That's sweet, but I wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, no. No. Think of it as doing me a favor.
I wouldn't have to worry about you being out there.
okay.
Rorschach's journal, October 21st, 1985.
on 43rd and 7th, saw Dreiberg and Jupiter leaving diner.
they didn't know me without my mask.
an affair?
did she break Manhattan's heart to engineer his exile...
...make room for Dreiberg?
does Manhattan even have a heart to break?
the alley was cold, deserted.
my things were where I left them, waiting for me.
my coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.
my face.
putting them on, I abandoned my disguise...
...became myself.
free from fear or weakness...
...or lust.
down alley...
...heard woman scream.
first bubbling note of city's evening chorus.
attempted rape.
mugging.
both.
the man turned...
...and there was something rewarding in his eyes.
sometimes the night is generous to me.
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife named Roy Chess.
at his apartment, I found clues.
seems he worked at Pyramid Transnational.
I've seen the logo before...
...at Moloch's.
someone tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch.
guy worked for Pyramid Transnational.
more than a just delivery service, I take it.
last time I was here, I saw a pension check written from the same company.
I'm guessing it's a front set up by whoever wants us masks dead.
now, no more lies, Moloch. Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach.
this is the police. We know you're in there.
no. No!
if there's anybody in there with you, send them out unharmed.
no. No, no, no!
framed. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
never, never surrender.
all right. I hope you're ready, hero.
when you are.
one...
...two...
...three.
come on.
son of a bitch.
Christ, he stinks. -Get that mask off him.
I got it. -No. No!
my face! Give me back my face!
the masked vigilante Rorschach was apprehended...
...and identified as Walter Kovacs, a 35-year-old white male.
little's known about Kovacs, but he was charged with the murder...
...of Edgar Jacobi, found shot in the head in his home in the Bronx.
police officers were injured and Jacobi's home was set ablaze during the violent course of the capture.
Rorschach!
I'm gonna fuck you like I fucked your mother!
come on out, Rorschach!
Walter Kovacs.
is that your name? Walter?
well, let me explain your situation here, Walter.
you cooperate with me...
...and I may be able to convince them that you should be treated medically.
in a hospital. I believe that would be good for you.
but the authorities wanna put you with the general population.
prison's a prison. -Uh-huh. Yes.
but the difference is, down there...
...you'd be eaten alive.
you're responsible for a lot of them being in prison here, Walter.
tell me what you see.
a pretty butterfly.
what about now? What do you see here?
mom?
is he hurting you?
you got a fucking kid in here. I get that at home.
bastard. I should have had that abortion.
some nice flowers.
I heard this guy's mom's a whore.
did you catch any diseases from her?
huh? Whoreson. Listen to me, retard.
Hey, you think she'd suck my dick for a dollar?
clouds.
tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that, Walter?
you keep calling me Walter. I don't like you.
you don't like me. All right, why is that, exactly?
you're fat.
wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.
what you call compassion.
wanting to protect and understand the guilty.
this rotting society, what it calls rehabilitation.
nothing short of compromise.
is it a compromise to want to make you well?
there are other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine, doctor.
of course, they're not famous, are they?
you want to know about Rorschach?
I'll tell you about Rorschach.
once a man has seen society's black underbelly he can never turn his back on it.
never pretend, like you do that it doesn't exist, no matter who orders him to look the other way.
we don't do this thing because it's permitted.
we do it because we have to.
we do it because we're compelled.
I was investigating a kidnap case.
blaire Roche.
six-year-old girl. I was young then.
too soft on criminals.
I let them live.
broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.
I knew the girl was here...
...but when I searched the place, I saw nothing.
and then I found her.
Fred.
Barney.
who's going to bark for Daddy?
it was dark when the murderer got back.
as dark as it gets.
Oh, God. Who's out there? Who is it?
who is it?
what? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you?
what the fuck do you want? You killed my dogs, man!
you think I had something to do with that girl? I found that.
what evidence have you got? That's nothing.
okay. I confess.
I kidnapped her. I killed her.
arrest me.
what? Arrest me!
I did it! I said I did it!
Christ.
look, I've got a problem, man. Fucking take me in. I need help.
no, don't. Don't do that. Take me in. Don't! No!
men get arrested.
dogs get put down.
tremors of impact shook my arm.
warm blood splashed my face.
whatever was left of Walter Kovacs died that night with that little girl.
from then on, there was only Rorschach.
see, doctor, God didn't kill that little girl.
fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs.
if God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind.
from then on, I knew:
God doesn't make the world this way.
we do.
I can't help him.
Hey, Rorschach.
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?
rorschach, I heard your mother was a whore.
Hey, you know what? I'm pretty famous too.
ain't that right? That's right. -That's right.
maybe I can give you an autograph. What you say, big boy?
none of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you.
all right, that's it!
you're locked in here with me.
Laurie!
shit.
hold on. -Fuck.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I'm so sorry. I was snooping and must have hit the wrong button.
are you hurt? -No, no.
okay. -I'm fine. I just feel so bad.
no, don't worry.
it's happened before. Comedian did it back in '77.
Archie survived that.
Archie?
Oh. Well, uh, short for Archimedes...
...Merlin's pet owl.
stupid nickname.
how did you ever afford all this stuff, anyway?
well, my dad was in corporate banking and left me a lot of money when he died...
...which always surprised me. I mean, he was...
I think he was disappointed I went into crime fighting instead of following him.
guess I was just more interested in birds and airplanes, mythology and...
Plus, there were enough other guys doing this so that I didn't feel ridiculous.
like Hollis.
Yeah.
Yeah, he was my hero.
man, I remember the first time that I met him...
...I just felt so connected, you know?
to something that mattered.
must be nice having a secret identity.
a secret place that nobody knows about.
you can just come down here and hang out without anyone checking up on you.
nobody watching you.
want to try those on?
there we go.
wow, these rock.
they amplify the spectral range.
thermal imaging.
they work even better in the dark.
you can see me, right?
I can see everything.
I remember, no matter how black it got...
...whenever I looked through those goggles, everything was as clear as day.
this must be the way Jon sees the world.
we should probably head up. Food's getting cold.
put those away when you're done.
soviet ambassador to the U. N. had no comment when asked if Dr. Manhattan's disappearance has fueled Soviet aggression in A fghanistan.
Dan.
jon sees a lot of things...
... but he doesn't see me.
well, uh...
Oh.
sorry.
come here.
what's the matter?
lf you could just move a little... -Okay.
Yeah. There you go.
Dan, what's wrong?
sorry, l...
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.
Oh, hell.
it's okay.
maybe we were just moving too fast.
we've got all the time in the world.
we'll take it slow.
it's been a long time, Rorschach.
big Figure.
small world.
I like that.
but you know, it is a small world in here.
and I've been in it for, how long now, Lloyd?
almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.
that's right.
fifteen years since you and that Owl fella put me away.
so...
...Rorschach, that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute.
you know, by my count, there are more than 50 people in here that you put away.
I been talking to every one of them and they're all dying to get a piece of you.
this place is going to explode!
then, you die by inches.
tall order.
I'm going to tear this guy a new hole.
relax, Lawrence. Soon.
come on.
Dan?
is everything all right?
I'm tired of being afraid.
afraid of war...
...afraid of the mask killer...
...and afraid of this goddamn suit...
...and how much I need it.
me too.
so to hell with it.
let's take Archie out.
you're serious.
I used to be a masked avenger too, remember?
I'm used to going out at 3 in the morning and doing something stupid.
rapid burner. Be advised, all units.
tenement fire at 5th and Grand. Rapid burner.
let's go.
I can see it. -All right, hold on.
Dan, there are kids in there.
everyone, stay where you are and remain calm.
we're going to get you out of there.
the roof's starting to cave. Get me in there.
I'm going to get you close.
let's go.
come on.
all right, let's move it, people.
mom, is that guy in the space rocket...?
is that Jesus?
no, baby.
watch your step. -All right.
we're all set.
is that everyone?
Bye. -Bye!
I can't believe we did that.
they'll lock us up with Rorschach. -Who cares?
world War lll could start tomorrow.
right?
right.
come back here!
he's dead, Rorschach.
while everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift.
something from the machine shop.
Hey, boss, you notice?
none of that "small world, tall order" crap.
he knows once we slice open his lock, he's next on the block.
fat chance.
you're dead, Rorschach!
we got a prison full of killers out here. What do you got?
your hands, my pleasure.
can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
this riot won't last. I been waiting 1 5 years for this.
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're in the way of my revenge.
nothing personal, big guy.
boss! Wait!
now you find out what the score is.
One-nothing. Come and get me.
come on.
so I've been thinking.
I feel that we have an obligation to our fraternity.
I think we ought to spring Rorschach. -What?
someone set him up.
and this whole cancer thing with Jon, it just doesn't make sense.
you didn't get it.
Yeah, but breaking into a maximum-security prison is a little different than putting out a fire. -Yeah, you're right.
it'll be more fun.
hurry, Lloyd. I want to smell this son of a bitch cooking.
Yes.
no.
never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really.
Two-nothing. Your move.
get out of the way!
no. No.
Where's my face?
don't kill me.
your turn, doctor.
tell me, what do you see?
don't move!
Rorschach.
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.
excuse me. Have to visit men's room.
Oh, for chrissake.
good to see you in uniform, Daniel.
should've known all you needed was nice pair of legs to motivate you.
you're such an asshole, Rorschach. -Spare me indignation.
picked hell of a time to be unfaithful to Jon.
get tired of being patriotic, or someone put you up to it?
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
Hey! Would you two stop? You can argue later.
I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire soon.
stop! Stop or we will shoot!
are you all right?
Yeah. Just...
...heavy, you know?
war, jailbreak.
don't worry about it. Okay? Everything's going to be fine.
Hello, Laurie. -Jon.
TV said you were on Mars. -I am on Mars.
you and I are about to have a conversation there.
what are you talking about?
you're going to try to convince me to save the world.
Laurie, don't. -Dan, trust me.
I have to go.
beautiful, isn't it?
forgive me. These things sometimes slip my mind.
it won't happen again.
that's comforting.
Oh, my God.
I'm on Mars.
Hey. Nice ass. -Hey, asshole.
Hey, let's see if that comic-book retard's up here.
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.
you all hear? Some super-owl dude just busted Rorschach out of prison.
Rorschach? -Yeah.
that fool put my cousin in a wheelchair.
you mean Nite Owl. Him and Rorschach used to be partners.
Yeah. -Maybe he messed your cousin up too.
didn't he write a book or something? -Yeah.
you know, he lives over a garage right near here.
yeah? -Does he, now?
Hello?
Sally?
Hollis? -Yeah.
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.
all this time you've had my number and you wait until our sunset years to use it?
well, it seemed like a special occasion, Sal.
what?
the TV is reporting there was a tenement fire last night.
there were trapped people rescued by airship...
...and they say the pilot was dressed like an owl.
and it seems he had a sexy woman with him.
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?
I can't get over Laurie back in costume.
maybe she'll finally thank me for getting her started in the first place.
you know, Sal, by the sound of your voice...
...you're sounding younger than ever.
Oh. Why, bless you, Hollis.
but that's probably just senility.
well, it's been great talking to you, Sal...
...but someone's knocking.
well, don't get too misty-eyed thinking about old times.
you take care now, Hollis.
Ah, you too.
Bye.
Bye.
we're looking for Mr. Owl.
Yeah. Hold your horses.
Mr. Owl, you there?
trick or treat.
you should've stayed retired, Owl.
I hate this.
cowering in cave, hiding from authorities.
cops are out there hunting us. Unless you want to go back to prison...
...we'd be stupid to expose ourselves without a plan.
and what would that be?
once we've established a pattern...
...we can break into Pyramid, see what we find.
did that. Dead end.
I think it's a front company for whoever's really behind it, but can't prove it.
we need to hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people.
sure, why don't we just pick names out of a phone book?
you forgot how we do things, Daniel.
you've gone too soft. Too trusting. Especially with women.
okay, no. Listen, I've had it with that.
God, who do you think you are, Rorschach?
you live off people while insulting them...
...and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that, man.
Daniel...
...you are a good friend.
I know it can be difficult with me sometimes.
forget it.
it's okay, man.
let's do it your way.
Oh, God.
pyramid Transnational. Anyone heard of it?
Oh, you bastards.
I buy everyone a round and you sell me out like this?
back off, or I'll stick this glass in your squidgy face.
everybody stay calm. We'll try to keep this brief.
Roy Chess. On Pyramid payroll.
tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Dead now. Did you know him?
no.
Yeah, yeah!
I hired him. I knew him from the inside. -You're a felon.
I was. I've been straight ever since I got out, I swear.
I barely knew Chess that well, but I was told to hire from the old life.
told by whom? -My contact, Miss Slater.
Janey Slater works for Pyramid too?
Yeah, she was real nice. She said hiring ex-cons was part of the company program.
give people a second chance. God, please let go! I'm telling the truth!
Janey Slater, Manhattan's old girlfriend.
Adrian might help us find out who's underwriting Pyramid.
follow the money.
...former member of the Minutemen Hollis Mason found murdered in his apartment less than an hour ago.
witnesses reported seeing members of a local gang known as the Knot-Tops Ieaving the area right around the estimated time of death.
reporting live, Tiffany Burns...
who did it? -I knew you were going to victimize me, man.
what about my civil rights? Just because I'm wearing
tell me who did it! -A lot of people dress like this.
who murdered Hollis Mason?
you tell your friends they're dead.
I'm going to take out this entire rathole neighborhood.
I'll break your neck!
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.
this is where we hold our conversation.
in it, you reveal to me that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.
you know about me and Dan? -Not yet.
but in a few moments you're going to tell me.
if you already know the future, then why were you surprised when I left you?
or when that reporter ambushed you?
why even argue about it if you already know how this is going to end?
I have no choice.
everything is preordained.
even my responses.
and you're just going through the motions.
the most powerful thing in the universe is still just a puppet.
we are all puppets, Laurie.
I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.
and what if you're wrong?
why does my perception of time distress you so?
because it's inhuman.
because it makes me insane.
you always say you want to comfort me. Well, it isn't working.
look, I don't want to fight.
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.
you slept with Dan?
you just said that you already knew about that.
I said often that you were my only remaining link to humanity.
why would I save a world...
...I no longer have any stake in?
then do it for me.
if you really care.
when you left me, I left Earth.
does that not show you that I care?
my red world here, now means more to me than your blue one.
let me show you.
bombers are fueled and ready, sir.
it's time, gentlemen.
take us to DEFCON one.
not in penthouse. Not in office.
what nocturnal proclivities entice a man with everything out into the night at this hour?
Daniel?
