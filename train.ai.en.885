and not only that. I think that the kidnapper may have recently crossed paths with Bethany Simmons.
I think he recognized her.
and I think he did something terrible to her.
well, this is all very interesting, Allison, except for one thing.
christopher Sipes has never contacted us about any kidnapping.
of course not. He's afraid to.
read that card again.
contact the police and she will die.
this is ridiculous. Amy is fine.
I discussed this with you yesterday.
She's-she's in Mexico.
and we heard you, but if, by chance, she wasn't fine, if, by chance, there was something else going on...
well, there's nothing else going , other than she's looking for a little bit of peace, little bit of solitude.
then would you mind terribly if we contacted her, just to confirm that?
Yeah. In fact, I would.
the woman wants to be left alone.
she's trying to decide whether or not she wants to be married to me, all right?
so, I think you two would understand that I don't want to upset her.
I don't want to jeopardize that.
if you'd like, when she get back, I'll have her call your office.
so...
unless there's anything else, you guys...
actually, there is.
we don't believe that your wife is spending time alone.
we think she may have been abducted.
we think the man who took her may have kidnapped someone else.
Mr. Sipes, if you won't involve the authorities with your wife's case, then it's far less likely we'll ever know what happened to this other victim.
I'm sorry to hear that, but what do you want me to say?
my wife is not missing.
so there's no case in which to involve you.
I'm home.
you want to hear something weird?
I want to the pizza store and they were all out of pizza.
he gave me this empty pizza box to take home so I would stop crying.
look, he tricked me!
that's not funny. Bad Mommy, right?
Ooh, bad Mommy!
Hey, honey, where's Ariel and your daddy?
well, Ariel's in her room, and well, Daddy's packing for California.
daddy's going to California?
California? I thought we had this conversation.
well, we said we'd sleep on it, right?
okay, so how did you sleep?
I slept pretty soundly, actually pretty good.
I woke up pretty much convinced it didn't make a lot of sense to work for a company that was based in San Diego.
I mean, not if they were going to make me work there, too.
you know? 'Cause we got our roots here and the kids and the family and your job and all that, so...
okay, that's kind of how I slept, too.
so why are you going to California?
cause this guy Simon Burwell called me.
I guess he didn't sleep as soundly as we did.
well, he didn't call. His office called.
I guess he's, you know, he's got a proposition for me.
he wants to buy me lunch tomorrow in San Diego.
he sent me, you know, a first- class ticket and everything.
okay, but if you're not interested...
see, that is the difference between you and me.
see, I suspect a lot, but I know very little.
it's just a proposition.
I mean, there are almost, like, no jobs out there.
how do I... how do I not even listen to this guy?
I made it very clear that this family is not moving.
okay, so, just let him woo you over the phone.
the whole trip is going to take, like, six hours.
I'll be home before dinner.
speaking of which...
it's in the kitchen. It's the round thing in the square box.
excellent. My favorite.
I buried your wife an hour ago.
she has approximately five minutes of air left." UNFORTUNATELY, YOU DON'T.
look, I don't... I don't understand.
I did what you said. I brought the money.
what the hell are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I just had to make sure I got to you before you left.
left? Left for where?
to pay the ransom.
you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
Mr. Sipes?
do you know who I am? Do you know what I do?
I know who you say you are.
I know what you purport to be.
I already saw everything that's going to happen.
the spot in the desert where it all takes place.
the two green duffle bags that you're going to use to carry the money.
the kidnapper is going to double-cross you.
when you give him those bags, he's going to shoot you.
and he's going to leave your wife there to die.
please, let me help you.
call my boss. Tell him everything you know.
do you know what I do for a living, Mrs. Dubois?
I buy and I sell real estate.
I do it without lawyers, without bankers, without brokers.
just me.
staring into the eyes of whoever it is I'm doing business with.
and that's what got me here.
now, I'm not admitting that someone has taken my wife.
but if someone ever did...
I'd look them in the eye, ask them what they wanted, then make the best damn deal that I could.
now, maybe they'd shoot me...
but I doubt it.
it's bad business.
there's no upside.
but you wouldn't understand that.
that's why I live in this big house and you drive that piece of crap that you do.
now, get off of my front porch.
Hello?
you have a collect call from an inmate at the Arizona State Women's Correctional Facility.
to accept the call, please press "one.
she called!
Yeah. Bethany. She called.
her parole officer gave her the message and she called.
you're kidding. What did she say? Where has she been?
off the wagon, doing drugs, worse.
she wanted me to know she was on top of it.
she started meetings yesterday. She's 24 hours clean and sober and she sounded pretty positive.
well, that's great.
I told her that, um, if she, uh, you know, felt like coming by, I'd like to see her.
and, um, same goes for you, if, you know, you'd like to drop by and visit.
of course.
okay. I got to go.
Oh, Cynthia.
thanks for calling.
Yeah, okay. Bye.
Mr. Burwell.
sorry. Am I late?
no, no. No, you're early. - Oh, good.
I'm just earlier.
okay.
please call me Simon.
Simon. Thank you. Thank you.
did I mention the ocean?
I just, uh... Oh, God.
I don't know how I'm going to make this work.
it's a family thing, right?
moving? I get that.
I just... You know, I really hate the idea of doing this without you.
I don't know what to tell you.
all right. Okay.
we're engineers.
we're supposed to be problem solvers.
solution brokers.
let me... let me hit you with a potential solution.
all right? You tell me what you think.
don't leave Phoenix.
my God, you're a genius.
Yeah, hold that thought.
what I meant to say was, um...
don't have your family leave Phoenix.
you know, they stay put. You come here.
like you did today. You get on a plane.
you do your work. Finish your work.
you get back on a plane.
so, I would work here for, like, five days a week?
Yeah.
a lot of people do it.
Yeah, I know. I know a lot of pple dot.
I just... I don't think that I could.
being a husband and a father, you know, just for weekends,
I don't think that's going to work for us.
I don't think that's going to work for me.
all right. Okay. Let me reengineer this.
what if I said I want you in San Diego three days a week?
tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
then Monday, Friday you stay in Phoenix, telecommute from home.
Tesseract will pay all your travel, set you up with an apartment here.
and that way, you see your kids.
see your wife.
and you get to finish what you started.
and... And I will still throw in the ocean.
I'm home!
daddy's home!
I told you I would be home before dinner.
Hey, what's in the bag?
what's in the bag?
San Diego?
I got one for everyone.
you have to admit, this man is twisting himself into a pretzel to make this thing work.
okay, I admit it. Do I have to like it, too?
Allison, this is a chance for me to see this thing through.
to its completion.
and this means everything to me. - No, I know that.
this could mean everything to our future.
and it's a chance for me to keep working.
I don't think you understand how bleak it is out there.
no, I do. - Okay, then.
well, tell me that you're okay with this.
I'm okay with this.
Really? 'Cause you don't look okay, Allison.
I mean, I really... I don't think that you truly understand.
I understand. I understand. Three nights and three days, each and every week, you're not going to be here.
and it's... It's not that I'm afraid that my life is going to get that much harder.
I'm just sad about all the things you're going to miss.
the homework you're not going to be able to help with.
the tucking in, the kisses good night you're not going to be able to give them.
but I get it.
I get all the rest of it.
you have a dream. We got a mortgage to pay.
I get that.
and even though I'm sad for them, and I'm sad for me,
I really am happy for you.
you just can't see that.
or maybe I can't show that to you right now, and I'm sorry about that.
are you awake?
n... No.
I'll miss you.
I already miss you.
well, that's your own fault-- I haven't even left yet, and you're already acting like I'm gone.
shut up.
we'll tell the kids in the morning?
tell the kids in the morning.
and it's good news, right?
not the going-away part, but the job part.
seeing something through till its finished part.
it's good news.
so, what happened with the girl, the missing girl?
did you find her?
do you really care?
Yeah, I care-- I mean, I care about you, so yeah.
I... I care.
well, turns out she never really was missing.
I was wrong.
seems like I'm wrong about so many things lately.
you all right?
you look like you just saw a ghost.
sorry.
you ever get that thing, um...
where you see somebody really familiar?
for a second there in the dark you just looked like someone I used to know.
somebody you like?
Yeah.
it was a long time ago, though.
I'm sure he wouldn't recognize me now.
Yeah, I liked him.
I'm sure I'll probably like you, too.
Oh, I'm certain of it.
you know, seeing you like that, all wet, it's kind of sexy.
I was thinking I might need a shower, and a big, strong man to soap me up.
Yeah. Let's do it.
how about you run on in there and get the water going,
I'll be right behind you.
would you just give me a second?
Hey, Allison.
what's with the armed escort?
they're for you. So's this.
clothes? - Cynthia, the dream I told you about, it happened.
Bethany crossed paths with the man who kidnapped her.
only he didn't recognize her; she recognized him.
Allison, calm down.
I told you, she called, she's fine.
no. No, Cynthia, she is not fine.
she's in real trouble.
the reason that she called you is, she wanted you to stop asking people where she was.
she didn't want anyone to know.
know? Know what?
that she had decided to get even.
she got his name and address.
she kidnapped his wife.
Cynthia, once this man, Christopher Sipes, makes that ransom drop, Bethany plans on shooting him and leaving his wife to die in a shallow grave.
I saw it, Cynthia.
look, I'm worried that he has already gone to make the drop.
it-it's the perfect revenge.
she even has Sipes making the drop at the exact same place where he buried her, in the middle of the desert, in the middle of nowhere.
and no one who worked the original case knows exactly where that was.
no one really knows.
except Bethany.
and you.
well...
long time, no see.
didn't I just call you in prison?
what the hell are you doing here?
I had a pang of nostalgia.
I told the police
I'd be able to lead them to a scene of a kidnapping.
I told them that, uh,
I could get the kidnapper to come with me quietly, stop her from making a terrible mistake.
come on, Bethany.
you're many things, but you're not stupid.
they've got sharpshooters all around here, behind every rock, just waiting for an opportunity to pull the trigger.
it's a win-win situation for them.
as far as they're concerned, you've buried a woman alive.
but we know that's not true, don't we?
we know you'd never let that happen, not after what happened to you.
so give me the gun.
give me the gun and tell me where the lady is.
why are you doing this?
you know that he deserves to die.
Yes, and he will.
but not by your hand.
you know...
when I shot my daughter's killer,
I was so certain of what I was doing.
but I was walking around with this big hole inside me.
and I thought if I killed her, it would all just go away.
but you know what?
I still miss my daughter every day.
and I've still got this hole inside me.
now...
give me that gun, Bethany.
what about Sipes?
what happens to him?
Oh, he'll get what he deserves.
you know, he left a fingerprint on that ransom note that he sent to your parents, and we can match that bite mark on his hand to your teeth.
it's all over for him.
he already took your mother and your father.
don't give him you, too.
that's my girl.
good girl.
good girl.
well, they just found Amy Sipes.
she was groggy, but she was still alive.
she was exactly where Bethany said she'd be.
I knew Bethany couldn't hurt her.
well, there's my ride.
Thanks. No, thank you for...
for doing this.
you have a parole hearing coming up soon.
Yeah. My first.
well, my boss wants to go.
he wants to speak on your behalf to tell the board about evything you did here.
if that's okay.
tell him to come on by if he wants to discuss it.
make sure he brings you with him.
Hey, what are you doing here?
happened to be in the neighborhood. Thought I'd bring dinner by.
real dinner, not that microwave stuff.
hmm, you just happened to be in the neighborhood, huh?
maybe I didn't think you should be alone tonight.
you remembered.
of course I remembered.
today's the anniversary.
one year ago today, your entire family was slaughtered.
turn it down, Marie.
Marie, damn it.
don't get me wrong, but you seem a little, uh, tightly wound this morning.
Yeah, well, I feel a little tightly wound.
my head is killing me.
that dream keeps rattling around in my head.
al, come on now, we stayed up over an hour talking about that.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me.
it was a bad dream, a bad dream about losing your kids,
and that's a dream that every parent has at some point.
Yeah, I know, I was there the first time you said it.
then just think about it, Al.
everything you told me about this dream
all the places, all the people--You said yourself you didn't recognize any of 'em.
okay, so maybe, maybe, don't you think that maybe?
that just might mean that it wasn't real?
and until you... Wait, hold on
until you see something that is real,
that makes it real, that's the way we have to think.
cause we can't start living our lives
like this is, this is our last year.
we can't do that to our kids.
I love you, too, Mommy.
Marie, Mom doesn't want you to read the notes until lunchtime.
otherwise, she'd just hand 'em to you with your cereal
it's all right, Marie.
I'll write you a new note.
Hey, uh, don't forget.
I don't have Dad's car today,
so I'm going to need a ride to the Art Institute after school.
they're, uh, having dance tryouts for this summer's dance program.
uh, check your bag.
Oh, Mom, you didn't.
okay, you do know that I'm 16, right?
I don't think it's going to fit me.
there are some onesies in here, and I think some dresses.
some of the stuff goes all the way back to Ariel,
so feel free to toss whatever you don't want.
Oh, my God!
please, don't hurt me.
I beg you, no! Please!
don't!
I don't understand.
I know you're going to kill me.
why not just kill me?
cause this is more fun.
you need something else?
uh... who sits at this desk?
uh, most of the time, a detective named Luis Ruiz.
but, uh, he's been out on assignment for about two months.
cloak and dagger stuff.
I actually have no idea what he's doing. Why?
everything I'm about to tell you is highly classified information.
I'm sure you two have heard about what's going on down in Mexico.
the carnage, it's...
like nothing they've ever seen before.
gunfights in the streets,
wholesale murder, body count's well into the thousands.
it's a drug war.
two rival cartels are fighting over territories and distribution.
and now, some of that fighting is spilling over the border.
seen a rash of kidnappings and homicides across Arizona that we believe is connected to what's going on down south.
Allison, that detective that you think might be in danger,
he's actually been working undercover as a part of a joint investigation
between us and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
miraculously, he's managed to get inside one of the cartel's operations
right here in Phoenix.
no law enforcement agency has ever had a man in so deep with one of these organizations.
well, that's great.
when's the last time anyone actually heard from him?
well, when a man is working that deep undercover,
he can't be expected to check in with any regularity...
now that man that you saw torturing him...
Yeah, the one with the burn scar on his face.
Oh, my God.
this is him.
I was afraid of that.
he's, uh, he's been the cartel's top enforcer for years.
now, he specializes in the assassination of Mexican politicians and judges.
we've suspected for a long while that the cartel has stationed him here in Arizona.
but, um, no one's been able to lay eyes on him.
his presence here would certainly explain this rash of violence.
Hey, you.
okay, I'll ask.
why are you looking at me like that?
Allison, everybody's been trying to reach you for two hours.
3: 00, Ariel?
dance tryouts?
art Institute?
Oh, my God, I...I was supposed to go get her.
I completely forgot.
it's okay. She called me.
I postponed a conference call and I got her there.
I don't understand. How could she not get ahold of me?
well, she called your office and they said you were behind closed doors.
and we both tried your cell, and it just went straight to voice mail.
I don't even remember turning this off.
Oh, God...
al, you okay?
Yeah, it's nothing, I just have this headache and I just can't seem to shake it.
do you want me to call Dr. Berman, see if he can squeeze you in first thing in the morning?
Joe, It's a headache.
I know, but I'm leaving for San Diego tomorrow,
so if you're coming down with something...
I'm not coming down with something; it's a headache. It'll pass.
promise you.
you know, I can, I can make it through three days without you.
if you really want to help me,
why don't you get the girls dinner and put them to bed,
so I can just crawl under the covers and try to sleep this thing off?
okay, go ahead. Crawl away.
Hey.
by the way, she got in.
she nailed the tryout.
excellent.
sorry I'm late.
that's okay.
you said it was important.
I think I might have found someone who knows where he is.
who?
his doctor.
his name's Hector Cruz. He's in Guadalajara, Mexico.
wait a second. Where'd you come up with this?
I hired another private detective.
you're telling me you hired another private eye to hunt for Oswaldo Castillo after the last one took all your money and disappeared?
do you not understand that I do this for a living?
well, according to him?
he treats wounded cartel soldiers after-Hours in his clinic.
if we could just get in there,
if we could get into his files.
he's got to have some kind of a way to contact his patients.
not necessarily, if in fact, he's even really Castillo's doctor.
if in fact, he's even gone to see him in the last year.
or ten years or whatever.
not to mention the fact that you're talking about Mexico.
I have no jurisdiction in Mexico.
you know that.
and even if I did, we don't know that any of this is true.
I'm sorry.
the best I can do is to pass this doctor's name along to the Mexican authorities.
that's the best you can do?
look into his eyes and you tell me that you give a damn about jurisdiction.
look at him!
this is the man who murdered your wife.
this is the man who massacred my family!
No!
Hello?
no, you didn't wake me. It's only 8: 30.
Yes, Mr. District Attorney.
wherever you need me to go.
what am I looking at?
do you remember the police officer who was working undercover?
the one you were so concerned about?
that's him.
in the coolers in about a dozen pieces.
this is, uh, this is his house.
Oh, my God, that poor woman.
unfortunately, this is pretty standard stuff for these cartels.
targeting the families of their enemies, of law enforcement agents.
makes people think twice about investigating them.
the DEA's going to be setting up a task force in our offices until this is solved.
if it's all right with you, I'd like to introduce you to my colleague on the federal side.
he is the guy who's going to be running their whole show.
believe it or not,
he lost his wife to a cartel car bomb just a few weeks ago.
they murdered his wife?
I'd like you to meet Allison Dubois.
he's completely real.
I know, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you.
he's real, Joe. I didn't make him up.
he worked for the DEA.
not only that, they murdered his wife.
Who-who murdered this guy's wife?
he did it with a car bomb. He's a professional killer.
he works for this drug cartel.
he's the one that I saw torturing that detective.
okay.
this is it-- This is what he does.
he kills people. He kills people's families.
well, say so mething.
and we're next, right? Me and the kids, we're next?
that's where you're going, right?
why do you say this like it's a question?
I'm sorry, Allison, I don't know how to continue this conversation unless it's a question.
how do you want me to continue? Like it's a certainty
my death, my children's deaths, they're absolutely certain?
well, hey, let's just go get the cyanide and end it all right now.
what the hell do you want me to do, Allison? Come on.
isn't it enough that my life is over, but now you're upset with me
because I'm not reacting to it properly?
what is it you want me to do?
what is it I want you to do?
what is it I want you to do?!
I want you to get your ass out of that damn bed,
and I want you to keep us safe!
I want you to act like you give a damn!
like what I'm saying matters to you!
of course it matters to me,
it completely matters. But I don't know what to tell you to do about it
if you're already convinced that doing anything is useless.
and I don't think that waking the kids by yelling at each other is the answer either.
there were five ice chests.
each with a different piece of that police detective in it.
I understand.
and I believe you, I do
I absolutely believe you.
but I also believe that standing out in the sun too long is going to give me cancer,
but I'll be damned if the kids and I are are going to spend the rest of our lives hiding in the dark.
what kind of an answer is that?
that's the only answer I have, Allison.
I can't believe that our fate is sealed, I can't.
life is about choices. You've just got to make the right ones.
well, what are they?
okay, let's say you're right.
let's say that we're a target for these cartel people because you work in law enforcement, okay?
then the answer's pretty simple. You got to stop working in law enforcement.
you're right.
of course I'm right.
I got to quit.
I mean, I know Devalos is counting on me, but I have to quit,
and I have to make sure that they know that I did.
that's right, for the sake of your family,
that's what you have to do, absolutely.
I mean, there's no other choice, is there?
I mean, if you're convinced that we're in danger, if you're absolutely certain of it,
no, yeah, you-You got to go into work tomorrow, you got to knock on Devalos' door
and you got to say, "I resign--For the safety of my family."
of course, if you're convinced that we're all going to die anyway,
what's the point?
which is why the choice that I would advocate involves two things.
first, that you embrace the possibility
that these things that you're dreaming about might not be set in stone.
and secondly, secondly, that you do your job,
you do your job as if your life depended on it.
as if your family's life depended on it.
and then-Then you might be able to find this guy, this...
Oswaldo Castillo. You find him and you put him away.
you put the people that he works for away.
and then, there's no reason for anyone to kill your family anymore.
and there's no one left around to do it.
you sleep here?
it's Allison, right?
well, I'm impressed, Allison.
none of my agents ever beat me into the office.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
don't be.
my wife's murder is part of this case.
so is this how it works?
your thing-- You look at a file, hope something comes to you?
to be perfectly honest, I have no idea how this thing works.
or even if it's going to work on any given day.
but, uh...
Yeah,
sometimes looking at pictures, at a file-- Sometimes it helps.
please, I want to show you something.
this is everything we've got.
had it expressed over from my El Paso field office last night.
look at whatever you like. My files are your files.
Ariel, come on, hurry up.
taxi's here to take me to the airport.
the girls are going to be late for school if you don't leave soon.
I'm on it, Dad. Don't worry.
Uh-oh, Marie's doing it again.
Marie, you're supposed to wait until lunchtime to read Mommy's messages.
Hey, come on, it's all right.
she doesn't have to wait if she doesn't want to.
come on, come on, you guys got to get going.
daddy, I can't read this. Could you please read it to me?
Marie, have a...
let me see yours, sweetie, can I...?
there.
Hi. Is this 220 Dekalb? I couldn't find any number on your house.
Thanks.
tu almuerzo.
I think I know where we can find him.
I think I know where Oswaldo Castillo's hiding.
Allison, you don't look well. Maybe you and I should go talk about this outside.
no, no.
I saw him.
I just saw Oswaldo Castillo. He's at 220 Dekalb.
he's at an old lady's house. I think her son was a friend of his.
why are you all just sitting there?
Allison, your nose.
Mrs. Dubois.
Dr. Cruz.
sorry to keep you waiting, huh?
not at all, Doctor. Thanks for squeezing me in.
please...
be patient with me. My English is a little weak.
we don't get too many tourists from your country in these parts of Guadalajara.
it says that you were hoping to get a prescription today?
for pain medication?
according to this, you are still experiencing some pain from a surgery that you had a year ago?
a brain surgery. I had a tumor growing on my brain stem.
usually I would just contact my own doctor for the pills, but since I wasn't planning on being back in the States for a few days...
you thought you would visit my humble clinic, huh?
you do realize, Mrs. Dubois.
you are not the first American to cross the border in search of narcotic pain medication.
I don't suppose you would have some documentation of your surgery.
a MRI perhaps.
thank you, Doctor.
I understand.
I was just hoping not to cut my vacation short, but actually I feel like I got everything I wanted.
Mrs. Dubois, do you mind letting me see your scar?
pardon me? - Your scar.
I mean, if you did undergo the procedure you are describing to me, it should not be a problem.
who knows? It might convince me to give you the prescription you are after.
for the right price, of course.
Allison, hey, hey, Allison, hey.
you're awake.
how you feeling? You okay?
my head hurts.
how long have I been here?
just a few hours.
listen, Al, um, they ran some tests while you were unconscious.
and I need to talk to you about what they found.
the brain tumor. I know.
I know.
as you can see you have a tumour in the region of the medulla.
the medulla's part of the brain stem.
it regulates motor functions, breathing, heartbeat, R.E. M. sleep.
the medulla's in charge of all of that.
these headaches you've been having?
they're a symptom of your condition.
as the tumor grows, there's less space in your skull for your brain.
and that can cause something called elevated intracranial pressure.
and that can lead to all kinds of side effects, including difficulty understanding and expressing language.
which might explain the garbled notes you told me about.
so this tumor, this thing inside of her brain, are we talking cancer?
we have no way of knowing until we examine the tissue.
and we can't do that without performing a surgical procedure.
a procedure that we need to do in any event to remove the tumor and relieve the pressure on the brain.
no, the tumor is benign. I already know that.
that's good, Mrs. Dubois.
it's important to think positively.
no, you don't understand.
I know it's benign.
I heard you, Mrs. Dubois.
and I'm aware of your reputation.
but even if you're right, it changes nothing.
we need to get in there.
the tumor is growing quickly.
if we do not do something soon, very soon, it can lead to something we call "herniation of the brain.
and that can cause paralysis, coma... and even death.
it's okay.
none of those things are gonna happen to me.
when do we do this? - As soon as possible.
I'd like to schedule it for tomorrow morning.
you want to open up my skull tomorrow morning?
okay, I'm fine with that.
that's excellent.
girls will be getting out of school soon.
I want to bring them here so we that can tell them both together.
no. - What?
I want you to take the girls and get out of Phoenix.
I don't care where you guys go, just stay away.
what? Whoa-whoa-whoa. What are you talking about?
you are in danger, Joe.
you, the girls.
everything I've been dreaming lately, it's all coming true.
and I know if you and the girls stay here, you're gonna die.
Allison... you're ill.
Yeah, now, but in the future, in the future, I am better.
I survive all this.
No! This is serious, Al.
you have a brain tumor!
you're asking me on the eve of a surgery that you might not survive, to-to pack up our kids and take them as far away as I possibly can? No!
I'm not listening to your dreams, not this time.
No! - Yes!
Hey, look at this!
take a good, long look 'cause this is what that tumor's doing to you when you try to write.
now imagine what it is doing to you when you try to dream.
I don't care! - No!
your dreams cannot be trusted right now. No.
what if I'm right?
I know I'm sick.
and I know you're worried about me.
but please
I beg of you, please?
I don't want to survive this if I can't have my family.
okay. All right.
okay, fine. You win.
okay, I'll go home.
I'll take them to my sister's.
I'll tell them we want them to stay there so that I can stay here in the hospital with you.
No! That is the best that I can do.
because I need to be here when you wake up in the morning.
and I need to be here every morning until you're better.
and that is just the way that it's gonna be.
I, uh, I heard about your illness.
I'm so sorry.
I won't stay long.
I just wanted to let you know that we went to that address you gave us.
found a bunch of weapons hidden on the property, men's clothes, some fake I. D.s that belonged to Oswald Castillo.
but not him?
not him.
we must have just missed him.
he must have known we were coming because he left in a hurry.
left behind his money, his weapons.
this is a good thing.
we will find him.
I wish I could believe you.
I've dreamt about him, you know.
he wants to hurt my family.
I don't know when, I don't know where...
but it's coming.
ma'am, I know we don't know each other very well, but today you very nearly led me to the man who murdered my wife.
these things you've been seeing?
I'm not gonna let 'em happen.
you're not gonna let them happen.
that's why we're here.
that's why we're in this together.
good luck, Allison.
sir, what are you doing here?
I got the voicemail message you left me this afternoon.
and you said some very nice things, Allison, but I have to admit the message alarmed me.
all that talk about how glad you are to have known me.
how appreciative you are of everything I've done for you.
to be honest, Allison, it sounded like a good-bye.
I was just depressed.
I guess I just called to say hi.
I got your voicemail and I just... talked too much.
I'm sorry.
can I come in?
Oh, sure.
you know, I know we've been out of touch for a while, but I still consider you a friend, and it's...
listen, I just have to ask you this.
you're not considering doing anything drastic, are you?
No! No, I'm fine.
I mean, some days are better than others, but...
no, I'm not planning on doing anything drastic.
please.
you, uh...
you going somewhere?
I'm just going out of town for a couple days.
I see.
can you put it off?
what for?
because I'd like you to come to work for me again starting right now.
what would I do? I haven't had a dream in a year.
I don't care.
I'll hire you right now as a paralegal. You go back to school.
you finish getting your law degree.
look, as long as I have a job, you have a job.
I don't think so.
you have got to move on.
you owe it to the memory of your family.
I owe it to the memory of my family to do what I'm doing now.
I could have saved them...
Joe and the girls.
before that operation...
I was dreaming about Castillo.
I was on the path to finding him.
and I would have found him, I know it.
but after that surgery, when I woke up, it was just gone.
no more visions, no more dreams.
it was like when they cut that tumor out, they cut out my gift, too.
if I'd just put off that surgery, my family would still be alive.
Hey. I'm back.
um, it's good that you're up.
the nurse said that they're gonna take you in for surgery in ten minutes, so I brought you some stuff from home.
um, the girls all wrote you notes.
on paper napkins. They're hidden in here.
um, I wasn't supposed to tell you.
what's the matter, cat got your tongue?
hello - Where the hell are you?
it's... It's okay, Joe. Really, it's going to be okay.
no, it is not okay.
you ripped out your IV and you snuck out of your hospital room.
you're supposed to be in surgery right now.
Yeah, I know. I can't have that surgery.
what did you say?
I can't have it. At least not now.
it's going to take away my dreams, Joe.
it's going to take away my gift.
Allison, what the hell are you talking about?
look, I had another dream last night about the future.
and now... Ow.
and now I know that if I let them operate, it's going to be the last dream that I ever have.
Allison, you're delirious.
you're not making any sense.
I need to keep dreaming.
I need to find out how I'm supposed to save you.
after that, I swear, I will come back to the hospital.
I will come back to you.
with any luck, it'll just be a couple of days.
you could be dead in a couple of days.
tell Lee.
tell Lee that he shouldn't bother checking my credit cards because I just used the cash that I have in my purse.
I found a nice place to dream.
no, no, no, no. Allison. Allison, listen to me. Listen.
I love you, Joe.
whatever happens, you know that.
I love you more than anything.
I heard about your close call in Guadalajara.
didn't expect to see you back in the States so soon.
what can I say? I had a very good doctor.
there's an extra $20, 000 here.
cabrera family.
they want to make sure you know they appreciate the level of cooperation that you offer them.
what is that?
the garage door.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
her name's Allison Dubois.
you killed her family a little over a year ago.
doctor's office in Guadalajara.
you went there on your own, didn't you?
you left a cell number with the doctor.
he needed to contact you to give you the results of a blood test, see if your gunshot wound had gone septic.
the investigator I hired tracked the cell number this address.
that's how I got here.
now, what are you doing here, Daniel?
well, I guess we know.
all right, that's enough talk.
wait a second.
what's that smell?
don't worry about it.
pull the trigger.
we can all go together.
I cut the gas line before I closed the garage door.
I figure, by now, all it will take is one little spark.
you pull your trigger. I'll pull mine.
any spark will do.
explain to me how you can take money from these people after they did that to your wife.
Oh, see?
you're not so psychic.
he didn't start taking money after I killed his bride.
he was taking money for years.
you allowed them to murder her?
she figured out what I was doing.
I didn't like it, but...
Hey, the past is the past.
point is, nobody has to die now.
we can all walk away.
and you can walk away a very wealthy woman, Miss Dubois.
I don't want that.
I don't want money.
I want to see my family again.
and we all know there's only one way that I can do that now.
so, what is it going to be?
you're right.
ladies first.
agent Munilz.
you're here.
Mr. District Attorney.
it's awfully early in the morning to be seeing you. Something up?
well, we just received an anonymous tip.
a citizen spotted someone matching Oswaldo Castillo's description.
apparently, he's meeting with two other men in a parking lot outside a check cashing facility in Point Breeze.
right now? - We believe so.
squad cars are on the way. You can ride with me if you'd like.
sure. Let me just stick this in here and I'll be right down.
did you warn him?
Allison, my God.
I thought you were having surgery this morning.
what are you doing here?
I had to put it off.
I had to tell the District Attorney about a...
dream that I just had.
what are you talking about? Allison, no offense, but you look terrible.
I don't think you know what you're saying.
sir! You can come in now.
what's going on? I thought we were going after Castillo.
there was no tip. We just told you that so you would be compelled to contact Oswaldo.
may I see your phone, please?
absolutely not. This is my private phone. I just can't...
that cop you gave up, Luis Ruiz.
he sat five feet from me for the past three years.
I know his kid.
give me that phone now or I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice and then I'll take it from you.
this is insane.
I'm a Federal Agent. You just can't bully me.
that really doesn't matter much, Agent Munilz.
either you give me the phone or I go to the trouble of getting a subpoena and getting the records from your carrier.
they'll give me every call, every text, and as I'm sure you're aware, all I need to do is prove that you forwarded information about Detective Ruiz to the Cabrera cartel.
and that would make you an accessory to the murder of a police officer.
you'd be looking at the death penalty.
or you can give me your phone.
tell me where Oswaldo Castillo's hiding, and I might just be willing to settle for putting you in jail for the rest of your life.
okay. We did it your way.
now let's get you to the hospital.
Hey. Joe. Any news?
I haven't heard a thing. She's still in surgery.
well, I would have been here sooner, but your wife left me a very busy man.
Daniel Munilz gave us the address where Oswaldo Castillo was hiding.
we arrested him about two hours ago.
Joe, I know that Allison delayed her surgery because she was afraid that the cartel posed a threat to your family.
you should know that they're not a threat anymore. You're wife's a hero, Joe.
I know that.
I've always known that.
Mr. Dubois.
maybe we should speak in my office.
no. What's going on. Just...
tell me. How's my wife?
the procedure itself went well.
the tumor was benign.
and we were able to excise it almost entirely.
okay.
there was a small portion that had grown deeply into the tissue of the brainstem.
if it continues to grow, we think we'll be able to eliminate it with radiation.
that's... Okay.
so, how long before she's awake?
your wife had a stroke shortly before surgery.
the pressure in her skull, it just got to be too much.
we went ahead with the procedure anyway.
but now she is completely non-responsive and she's showing no signs of consciousness.
and so far, we've been unable to wake her.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dubois.
but until we can determine the severity of the stroke, it is impossible to predict when or even if she will ever come out of her comatose state.
my God, John.
look at you.
I just talked to your doctors.
you're dying.
I want you to admit what you did, John.
I want you to admit what you are.
I want you to say that you did it, John.
I want you to say it to me.
I'm the only one who still cares about what you did.
the police - they stopped investigating these murders years ago.
look at you, John.
they can't put you in prison now.
you beat us all.
you got away with it.
don't you want to take the credit for that?
c- cigarette?
now...
tell me.
you did it, didn't you?
no.
you're lying.
wake up.
come on, wake up and admit you did it!
admit it was you, you bastard!
admit it was you!
admit it was you, you bastard!
admit it was you!
admit it! - Admit it!
admit...
star, pyramid, fish, arrow, hand.
perfect.
how about...
that?
arrow, fish, hand,
star, pyramid.
excellent.
I don't understand.
how is that rehab?
I mean, anyone can read flash cards without words on 'em.
no, see, you're wrong.
okay, when people go through something g like mom,
when they're in a coma for a while,
sometimes they mess up the way they see things.
so it's important for mom to do her drills, so that we know that mom's head is working right.
actually, the official term for what your mom is doing is "cognitive therapy."
when she does it- which is not often enough.
I'm fine.
my cognitive skills are excellent.
when it comes to seeing stars, fish, and arrows,
I'm at the top of my game.
how about we let the folks at rehab decide that?
you look nice, daddy.
thank you.
here's hoping the good people at Burroughs-Strauss agree.
now, wait a second.
didn't you already dress up and go there?
good memory.
excellent cognition, Bridge.
Yes, indeed- I had a good first meeting there,
and today is the big day,
because today I meet the guy who, uh, who runs the department, and if everything goes well with him and I impress him,
well, then I may be done with dressing up and interviewing for a while, maybe even forever.
Hey, you know what. We got to get a move on.
I got to be at therapy in 45 minutes.
mommy, did you sign my thing?
Oh, right, the permission slip for that field trip next week.
I just have to remember where I put it.
you can't remember where you put that thing?
Hey, you know what, I'm gonna make my own permission slip.
I'm gonna make a note for your teacher,
and if she has any problems, she can call me, okay?
okay, mommy.
dollar sign, triangle, hammer,
house, and that last one,
I don't know what you would call it- looks... Kind of like a tunnel?
a tunnel? Really?
are you sure you don't want to take another look?
I'm sorry. It's a tree.
that's so weird, the first time I looked at it...
I wouldn't worry about it, Allison; it's really common for someone recovering from a stroke
to have lapses in memory, gaps in perception.
we call it "expressive aphasia."
the flash card exercises just work the muscle,
keep it from getting too serious.
but my stroke was months ago.
I've been fine.
I haven't had any perception problems before.
these things come and go.
the one thing that really helps is practice.
have you been using your cards at home?
well, I did look at them this morning...
it probably wouldn't hurt for you to be a little more disciplined.
okay.
someone's got flash card anxiety.
sorry.
I couldn't help myself.
I was watching you.
it's that obvious, huh?
well, for me it is.
but I've been playing with those cards for years.
you want a little tip?
try reading them from right to left.
Yeah. I know it sounds stupid,
but there's something about reading them backwards
that forces your brain to pay attention.
at least... It works for me.
well, thanks. I'll try that.
my name's Neal, by the way.
I'm a veteran of more cognitive therapy Than you'd ever care to remember.
my name's Allison. Allison Dubois.
you said that you'd-you'd had a lot of therapy.
do you mind if I ask you what happened to you?
I got mugged.
guy shot me,
left me, uh, to bleed in the street.
had some, uh...brain impairment.
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Thanks.
wherever the guy is, I hope he, uh, had a good time with the $22 he took from me.
they never found the man who did this to you?
no.
Oh. Forgive me.
Oh, it's a work call.
remember: Try to read them backwards.
Hello?
sorry to bother you on your day off,
but I was hoping maybe you could meet me at the morgue.
the girl's name's Catherine Tallridge.
my best guess is about 1: 00 last night
someone came up the fire escape,
broke into her place through a window,
strangled her, then left the way he came.
how can you be so sure It was around 1: 00?
one of the neighbors heard a commotion coming from the place.
he even called in a noise complaint.
by the time the squad car got there, everything was quiet.
no one answered the door.
the roommate got back from sleeping over at her friend's place.
found her like that.
you have any idea what that symbol on her head means?
symbol?
obviously, my most recent experience is with solar cells.
I know it's not a perfect fit for, you know, what you do here, but I figure there are some parallels that make me a...
good candidate.
solar, huh?
Yeah. Uh, I started a company; I sold it last year.
did your human resources department not send you down a resume?
Yeah, I-I-I think that they, uh, probably sent me something.
uh, well, my team and I were-were, uh...
projecting sales for the company.
uh, we d...
uh, we did a lot of research into biofuels 'cause we figured they'd be our biggest competitor in ten years or so.
Oh. Sorry. I've just got to take a look at this real quick.
I'm listening, though.
Oh, uh, uh, yes, some of the research, some of the reading that I did that made me wish
that I was working in the field, so I-I, you know, I'd love to...
To-to... To...
dive in with you.
Hello?
Oh, hey, Drew.
um, no, no, it's good timing.
I just got done with the interview.
uh, listen, I appreciate you...
appreciate you setting it up and everything,
but I don't think it went very well.
what do you mean, the guy loved me?
my god, Joe, that's fantastic!
when are you supposed to start?
human resources told Drew I could start whenever I'm ready.
I'm not working, so I told him I'm ready now.
I guess as of tomorrow there's gonna be two steady paychecks coming in the house.
you "guess"?
you don't sound happy.
I thought you really wanted this.
no, I-I do. I do. I just...
I thought I completely screwed the interview.
I thought the guy hated me, and then they offered me the job
before I could even drive off the property.
you know what that means? You're just that good.
honey, hold on a second.
I'm not paying attention where I'm going.
Hey, Al, you there?
did I lose you?
al, you all right?
um, yeah, honey.
I'm fine. Let me call you back.
admit it was you, you bastard! Admit it was you!
man: "I had been pursuing the libra for ten years."
it became an obsession that cost me my career and my marriage.
and so, when I went to visit john david boatner in the hospice where he lay dying, "when he finally admitted that he was the libra, "it was, in an odd way, the most intimate moment of my life,
and, I suspect, it was the most intimate moment of his life.
thank you.
there you go.
Hi.
should I make it out to someone in particular?
actually, if you've got a minute,
can I ask you a question?
sure.
when this was all going on,
when the libra slayer was originally murdering young women,
I'd just given birth to my second daughter,
and I was in the hospital.
I really wasn't paying much attention to the papers.
was these the sort of letters that he would send the police?
he used a different code for each murder.
and what is this?
that's the sign of the libra.
I guess you could call it his signature.
he carved it into each one of his victims.
and is this the man that you think was the libra slayer?
I don't think John david boatner was the libra slayer.
I know it.
are you sure?
weren't there any other suspects?
I'm positive. I've written three books on the subject,
and I personally collected reams of evidence.
Plus, he told me he did it.
when I went to visit him right before he died,
I told him if he didn't admit that he was the libra slayer,
then no one would ever know that he'd beaten the police.
he told you he didn't do it.
you gave him a cigarette.
he told you he was not the murderer.
look, I know you spent years believing it was him.
I can kind of understand why you would lie about what happened in the hospice,
but I think you're wrong about Boatner.
a young woman died last night.
I think she was murdered by the same person
who committed the original libra slayings.
I think he's back.
okay, let's say you're right.
let's say that John David Boatner didn't confess on his deathbed.
that doesn't necessarily mean he wasn't the killer.
I mean, in my experience
serial murder and a deep-seated sense of honesty
rarely go hand in hand.
Yeah, but there's a reason the police never arrested boatner for the libra's killings.
they never had enough evidence.
I've been researching this.
in fact, there's a fair amount of evidence to suggest he wasn't the killer.
they were never able to conclusively prove
that his handwriting was a match for any of the libra's notes.
there was never any physical evidence
to tie him to any of the crime scenes.
well, even if all that's true
even if John David Boatner is innocent,
I don't see anything that indicates that the libra killed Catherine Tallridge.
he was flamboyant, a game-player,
taunting the police with... With cryptograms,
carving his signature into the foreheads of his victims.
he took credit.
he liked taking credit.
now if you're correct, and this man is still walking,
still killing among us,
why didn't he take credit for this death?
no symbol was carved in her forehead.
no coded message was left for the police to decrypt.
if he killed her, wouldn't he want the world to know?
I think he wanted to. I think he ran out of time.
a neighbor heard noises coming
from inside Catherine Tallridge's apartment
the night that she was murdered.
she called the police.
I think he had to run out of there.
he didn't have time to sign his work.
I'm sorry, but I think you need to, uh... Rethink your theory.
that was the medical examiner.
Catherine Tallridge's wounds
were inflicted by an left-handed attacker.
the libra, as I'm sure you know from your research,
was right-handed.
I'm home.
Hi.
Hey, where is everybody?
homework.
I picked up a fudge ripple cake on the way home to celebrate.
what's with the long face?
you got a new job.
everything all right?
I was just about to ask you that.
um, this is the note that you wrote To marie's teacher this morning.
she sent it back.
car keys and your wallet now!
come on. Give me your wallet!
give me your wallet right now. Okay, okay, okay.
now your keys. Let's go.
let's go!
man, let me... Let me have my car.
I just need to get to work, and, you know...
you don't give me those keys,
you're not going to need anything ever again.
Hey. Hi.
you must be the new guy.
Joe Dubois. Welcome aboard, Joe.
Hey, Brian, can I ask you a question?
Yeah, shoot.
how do we get started here?
I didn't see any kind of staff meeting on the calendar.
Yeah, uh, we don't really do staff meetings here.
Really? Well, how do you find out What you're supposed to be doing?
how do you...? Well, who sets the agenda?
who establishes, like, the thresholds for projects?
well... Nobody, really.
this job is a little more read and react,
you know what I mean?
basically, you just wait Until Keith asks you to do something.
you met Keith, right?
Yeah. So...
I would just wait.
Allison. Hi.
I'd-I'd ask you to join me, but...
Oh, no.
actually, I left my sneakers in the car.
I came to see you.
Oh, thank you.
I don't know if I mentioned yesterday
I work with the district attorney's office.
Oh, uh, I know who you are.
I- I watch the news.
you're, um... A professional dreamer, right?
well, I don't know how professional I am,
but I do dream from time to time.
I actually had a dream About you last night.
I saw the man who shot you. I saw his face.
I don't understand.
the man who shot me was wearing a ski mask.
I never even saw his face.
and it was 11 years ago.
scanlon: That's fine, mr. Greybridge.
all we need for you to do Is to recognize his voice.
a voice id would give us probable cause To compel a dna sample.
if that matches the sample the police found Under your fingernails the night you were shot,
then we should have everything we need to convict.
are you ready?
okay.
number one, please step forward and read from the card.
you don't give me those keys,
you're not going to need anything ever again.
I don't think so.
scanlon: Thank you, number one.
number two, please step forward and read from the card.
you don't give me those keys,
you're not going to need anything ever again.
uh, I don't know.
maybe.
I'm sorry. It was... It was a long time ago.
you're doing fine.
remember, you don't have to worry about their faces.
you don't even have to look at their faces if you don't want to.
number three, please step forward and read the card.
you don't give me those keys,
you're not going to need anything ever again.
that's him.
I'm sure of it.
I don't even need to hear anyone else.
that's the man that shot me.
I'm get a uniform to start the processing.
we should be able to do the dna test this afternoon.
thanks for all your help, lee.
I know how busy you've been.
easiest case I ever closed.
thank you.
you okay?
Yeah.
thank you, Allison.
yeah?
Hi, Keith.
you just hired me.
today's my first day- was my first day.
it's, uh, it's 5: 30.
Yeah, n-no problem.
we'll, uh, we'll see you tomorrow.
uh, okay.
could I ask you something?
um, I... I spent the whole day out there,
and I read the, uh, the company handbook,
and I-I did the whole orientation.
um, but nobody actually spoke to me about work.
nobody, uh, filled me in on any projects,
uh, told me, you know, to do anything.
you maybe waiting for me to-to come to you with something?
like an idea or something?
no one explained it to you?
uh... This department
may run a little differently than what you're used to.
okay, that's all right.
no problem. I'll adjust.
just tell me what you need.
that's the thing.
I don't... I don't really need anything.
the truth is I-I prefer to be The only engineer on my projects.
honestly, I find it streamlines things.
you know?
collaboration can just be distracting.
right?
I'm sorry, y- you saying that-that
you're never going to ask me to do anything?
not very often, no.
why did you hire me?
uh... Corporate gives me A certain amount of money for staffing.
uh, and you know the way That corporate budgets work.
if you don't use that money, then,
well, it goes away.
but who knows?
in the future, I might need it, right?
so I hire people.
Yeah, I-I find that most people don't have a problem with this.
most people actually think it's a dream come true.
so... You know, uh,
maybe if you think about this as a kind of scholarship.
you're free to spend your days working on whatever you want.
you're just not going to be working on biodiesels.
joe: Turns out I could've been anyone.
maybe I was just the last interview.
maybe he was just tired of seeing people.
wait, he's just Going to pay you to sit there and do nothing?
Yeah, that's what he said.
he said to think of it as a kind of scholarship.
I mean, it's not like I'm going to turn down the money.
I mean, truth is, I can't.
but I don't know.
I mean, I know there are a lot of people out there
who'd kill to be, you know, getting a paycheck right now,
any kind of paycheck.
but I honestly don't know if I can do it.
I don't know if I can get up every morning and go into work,
knowing that my being there is of no consequence.
well, it will change once he gets to know you,
once he sees what he has...
you don't understand.
he doesn't want to know what he has.
and he certainly doesn't want to get to know me.
okay, that's enough whining.
I got to get my beauty sleep, so I can get up bright and early
and go into work and do nothing.
Devalos: 10: 21: Jacinda Birk stands at her window.
she sees a view of edison park, but cannot see me watching.
when she is asleep, I will go to her.
when she is asleep, I will make her mine.
and it goes on like that for the remainder of the page.
took a team of experts about ten hours to decode it.
you were right about Catherine Tallridge.
he confesses to her murder about five lines down.
are we sure this is authentic?
are we sure this is written by the original libra slayer?
I'm afraid we can't be certain about that.
when the libra slayer was last active,
he left coded messages with the body of each victim.
now, each of these codes was unique,
but all of the translated messages had a specific voice:
arrogant, derisive, almost clinical In the recording of detail.
the time of day, the victim's full name,
references to the location.
now, this new message- both in tone
and in the complexity of the code itself
appears to be identical To the messages left by the libra.
it even refers to details of the original crimes
that were held back from the press.
seems unlikely that anyone But the original killer would know them.
on the other hand, there is one detail that doesn't line up.
according to the medical examiner,
both Catherine Tallridge and Jacinda Birk
were murdered by a left-handed assailant.
but isn't it common knowledge?
isn't the libra slayer right-handed?
so we always believed.
but this new cryptogram
it was written by somebody who's left-handed.
whoever killed these women, if not the original libra slayer,
then it's someone who's doing things the exact same way,
but using the other hand.
talk to me.
I was wondering if you'd had a chance To look at the schematic that I left for you at lunch.
it's 5: 30; everyone's, uh, everyone's taking off.
I just didn't want to go
if you were planning on giving me any feedback
any reaction, a direction of some sort.
you talking about that wiring thing?
Yeah, um, that-that wasn't something That I asked you to do.
I know.
I read it.
it wasn't bad.
Oh, really? Do you want to sit down?
maybe we could set up a time we could go over it?
it wasn't bad.
it just wasn't excellent.
you know, I mean, frankly,
what was the point?
N- no offense, but I-I don't really have any use For that kind of work.
I mean, like I told you, I-I can get to excellent on my own.
so...
Really?
I was actually thinking About that wiring problem today at lunch.
uh... I came up with some pretty interesting stuff.
you can take a look if you want.
thank you.
I meant it.
it wasn't bad.
you're a smart guy.
which means that you're going to be miserable here.
I'm not saying that I'm unhappy.
it's just my second day.
no, I-I know you're not griping.
I just...
I know how this is going to play out.
most people, they come here,
they-they figure out how I like to operate pretty quickly.
you know, they-they settle in to doing whatever.
they like doing whatever.
but you... Have initiative.
the trouble is, I have no use for that.
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna e-mail the guy That runs the, uh, commercial aeronautics division.
they got some new contracts.
they're probably looking for talent.
I could offer to take one of their worst guys
in exchange for you.
you're gonna trade me?
sure. Yeah.
you'll like it down there.
they-they do some kind of interesting stuff with turbines.
scanlon: You look like you're cramming For the world's most gruesome final.
Yeah, well, The way this is going,
you might as well just hand me an "f."
I hope you guys are learning more than I am.
we've got half the homicide division pulling overtime.
so far, not much in the way of results.
your friend Neal Greybridge,
the, uh, assistant district attorney In charge of his case, called me.
apparently, they scheduled a sit-down with him.
they're building a case against the guy who shot him, so, uh,
you know, they need to go over his statement,
talk to him about taking the stand.
only problem is Neal never showed up.
I hope he's okay.
I keep calling him.
I know the ada Left him a couple messages.
but, uh, you know this guy.
I was thinking maybe you could reach out to him.
just, uh, make sure he isn't gonna flake out on us.
Hi, it's Neal.
leave me your name and number,
and I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Hi, Neal.
this is Allison Dubois again.
sorry to leave you another message.
just, uh, calling to make sure that you check in With detective scanlon tomorrow.
um, if you get this, can you call me in the morning?
I don't understand
why this guy won't call either one of us back.
maybe he's afraid to confront the guy who shot him.
I don't know.
when the doctors told Neal that he was paralyzed,
he basically just ignored them.
he doesn't really strike me As the kind of guy who's short on courage.
what are you reading so intently?
I thought you didn't have to do any work with your new job.
I don't. But I did.
I took your advice, and I tried to show him what I got.
unfortunately, when he saw it,
he couldn't have been less impressed.
so this is my boss's solution To a problem that I spent the whole morning working on,
and he dashed it off while eating a tuna sandwich.
read through it four times now, and you know what?
it's better than what I came up with.
way better.
I can see why the company puts up with this guy's quirks.
you know, it's-it's a shame that this much talent
is attached to a guy with zero people skills.
well... It's a shame,
but at least it won't be your problem anymore.
that's right 'cause I'm gonna do Some really interesting thing with turbines.
authorities have cracked the coded message That was left with the latest victim Of the so-called libra slayer, though apparently the note Has given them no further clues To the identity of the murderer.
and in other news, president bill clinton today vowed To fight impeachment char...
car keys and your wallet now!
come on. Give me your wallet!
give me your wallet right now.
okay, okay, okay.
now your keys. Let's go.
let's go!
man, let me... Let me have my car.
I just need to get to work and, you know...
if you don't give me those keys,
you're not going to need anything ever again.
so wait a second. You're telling me That guy that limped in here the other day
with the cane... Was the libra slayer?
Neal greybridge, yes, it's him.
Really? 'cause that guy can barely get around.
how does it work?
does he park in a handicapped spot before he kills someone?
I'm telling you it's him, lee. I saw it.
the original killings stopped 11 years ago Right after neal got shot.
they started again As soon as he was well enough to get around.
and you want to know why The killer's suddenly left-handed?
cause he can't use his right hand.
he's got a bullet lodged in his spine.
that sure would explain a lot of things.
like the handprint.
what handprint?
11 years go, the original detectives on the case
discovered a partial handprint on one of the letters That the libra slayer left behind.
they were sure that was the piece of evidence
that was gonna help them Put John David Boatner away.
the only problem was It didn't match. It wasn't his print.
bring Neal Greybridge in. Take his print.
if I'm wrong, you'll have lost a couple hours.
if I'm right... Maybe this whole thing will be over.
Keith, you got a minute?
actually, I don't.
just one minute.
promise. I just want to talk to you about that transfer.
what about it?
it's just gonna take a couple days To get through human resources.
I know that. Thing is, I don't want it.
Really?
I knew it.
suddenly, you realize the idea of a couple years of free money
isn't so heinous, huh?
uh, no. No, actually, it wasn't that.
uh, I read your notes.
your solution to the wiring problem- it's smart.
scary smart.
Oh, well, that's...
okay... Thanks.
you're welcome. Thing is, I don't want To transfer away from that kind of thinking.
no good engineer would.
Yeah, well, uh...
this isn't really about what you want.
I'm not so sure.
see, you need my help, man.
you don't know it yet, but you need my help.
you're clearly brilliant.
you're brilliant enough to get away with this Howard Hughes act
up until now.
but I guarantee you you're gonna get caught 'cause you're not doing your best work.
nobody does their best work in a vacuum.
now, you need someone to bounce your ideas off,
somebody to check your thinking against.
somebody who's smart enough to keep pace with you
and someone who's gonna call you on your crap.
I think I'm that guy.
so think about it.
if you agree, call off the transfer.
by the way, you're gonna want to check your work
on diagram seven, page four.
I fixed it for you.
hello.
scanlon: I'm in neal greybridge's apartment right now.
you should see his bookshelf: Cryptanalysis,
the codebreakers, pretty much everything That's ever been written on the subject of encryption.
are you bringing him in?
I'm not bringing him anywhere.
not right now, anyway. He's gone.
a neighbor told me she saw neal packing up his car
and driving off in a hurry.
this was the day before yesterday.
so, uh, something must have spooked him.
Oh, my god, Lee, I scared him off.
I told him that I'd been dreaming about him.
I even found the man who'd shot him.
he must have figured it was just a matter of time Before I learned the truth about him.
we should have him in custody right now.
we would have him in custody right now
if I'd just seen it sooner.
we'll find him, Allison.
it's just a matter of time.
I'm not sure we have time, Lee.
Neal spent the last 11 years of his life working his way Out of a hospital bed.
getting himself strong enough To do the one thing that he really loves.
now that he's back, I don't think he's going To stop killing women
just because the police know who he is.
you okay?
wait. Shh. I got to get this down.
thank you, sir.
I'll be waiting by the phone.
Devalos got the fax.
okay.
I told him what I know.
Neal Greybridge is going to leave that note
at the scene of the next murder.
the police are trying to decode it now.
Oh, well, that's good news, right?
so the girl will be dead by then.
it's right here. It's right here in front of me.
he stalks them; he notes their surroundings.
he documents everything.
if we could just read this,
we would know exactly who he's gonna kill,
exactly how he's gonna do it.
wait a minute.
I know this.
I know I know this.
joe: What you doing?
it's right here.
I had it right here the whole time.
what are you talking about? You had what?
this.
I need a pen.
Thanks.
this is the answer key.
dear mrs. Cezaux...
as a matter of fact, mr. Greybridge told us
he was willing to make a full confession.
there's only one condition:
before he'll issue his statement,
he wants to talk to you.
when I was in rehab,
they called me "a textbook example of courage, willpower."
nobody could believe that a man like Neal Greybridge
quiet little Neal Greybridge
could look a medical impossibility in the face,
and then step on its throat.
of course, what they didn't understand
was that Neal Greybridge
couldn't even make it out of his hospital bed.
and the part that I showed the world,
the part that everybody knew as "Neal Greybridge"
he didn't have that sense of purpose.
no.
the man that had the strength and the courage
to... Get out of bed and walk again...
that man is a part that I kept secret.
it's a part that still had work to do.
it's a part that had to get out of bed
and had to stand again and walk again.
if you say so.
why are you telling me this?
because you are the only person
that's ever actually seen that part of me
now that you know everything about me, I'm curious.
do you see me the way that I see myself?
I see an egoist...
self-centered, self-involved...
a murderer...
cowardly murderer...
a waste.
will there be anything else?
al? Hey, Allison?
are you hearing this?
what the...?!
whose baby is that?
and where's Ariel?
Joe, keep your voice down.
Where's our daughter?
she's right here.
Ariel's right here.
Oh, Joe.
my God, Joe, it's Bridgette and Marie.
it can't be.
how is that possible?
come on, Al, help me make sense of this.
I think maybe it's my fault.
I've been wishing for it secretly.
okay. I get it.
you're upset. But don't you think you're being a little bit immature?
so, listen...
what do you think about having another baby?
that's nice.
she's practicing.
make it stop!
I'm begging you to make it stop.
Hey, she's your sister, she's been at this all of two weeks, and this is important to her.
what she really needs is your encouragement.
and she's got it.
I'm encouraging her to stop.
great.
I was just getting the hang of it, and the reed breaks.
bridge, okay, come over here.
we'll get you another one.
have some breakfast.
that really stinks. I wanted Mommy to hear me play.
don't worry about it. Mommy isn't even here.
she got a ride with Detective Scanlon this morning.
do me a favor. Go get dressed.
I'll make you something to eat in the car.
and you promise that we'll go down to the music shop and get me a new reed right after school?
absolutely, I promise.
Oh, Lee, she's so beautiful.
Thanks.
so, how's Lynn adjusting?
there was no adjusting. It was instant.
the second little Lee came into the world, bam, she was a mom.
what is it with you women and kids? It's like a drug.
it is pretty amazing.
I woke up this morning convinced that I had to have another one.
Oh, I don't know what came over mere.
what did Joe have to say about that?
nothing. He pretended he was asleep.
Yeah. Well, it's different for guys.
it's an adjustment.
a great adjustment; a fantastic adjustment;
but an adjustment.
tomorrow night's date night.
I finally convinced her to get a sitter, leave little Lee for a couple hours.
Ooh! Big step.
are you excited?
I'm excited. She's terrified.
detective, advise your 20.
I've got a Code Two in Fountain Hills.
so you woke up... uh, what time?
6: 45, give or take?
the baby's just gone?
housekeeper's just vanished?
he's not in the nursery, she's not in her room.
her room? She has a room?
she stays here five nights a week in case the baby fusses or wakes up during the night.
and his name is Bryce?
Bryce, yes.
and, uh, that's a very recent photo- last weekend.
here's a picture of Elizabeth.
the housekeeper.
you said her last name was, uh, Torres.
Yes.
and during the night, you didn't hear anything?
uh, the baby didn't cry or anything, so, you have no idea what time this happened?
no.
how about your wife? Did she hear anything?
obviously, no.
so, is this it?
is it just you two?
a forensic team and some more detectives are on their way.
we'll get these to every media outlet in the area.
we'll get a description of the car up on Amber Alert.
can I speak with Mrs. Carlo?
uh, of course.
she was just... putting on some clothes.
she'll be, uh... She'll be down in a minute.
is the nursery upstairs?
Yes.
do you mind if I take a look?
I'll be up in a bit.
I'm gonna talk to the mother, and I want to be here when the rest of the cavalry shows up.
should I not be in here?
I see you're wearing gloves.
I shouldn't be in here, right?
I might ruin some clues or something?
Mrs. Carlo?
you're with the police?
my name is Allison.
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.
we're gonna find him.
wherever she went, wherever she took him, w- we're gonna find him.
I'm not worried.
I mean, of course I'm worried, but...
I also know that there's no one on the planet that loves Bryce as much as I do, except Elizabeth.
she worships him.
she lives for him, and that's how I know.
that's how I know he's okay.
but you do believe that she took him?
well, maybe she did, and maybe she didn't.
I mean, maybe this is all a dream, a nightmare.
in a little while, I'll wake up, and Elizabeth will be downstairs holding Bryce, and we'll sing songs and play games, and it'll just be another day.
what do you think the chances are that this address for Elizabeth Torres is good?
that we knock on the door, she opens it?
that the baby's there, asleep peacefully in a laundry basket?
ms. Torres, it's the police.
if you don't open up on the count of three, we're coming in.
okay, home before lunch.
nice work if you can get it.
Allison, you okay?
Yeah.
no, I'm fine.
are you sure?
it's that little baby. I can't get it out of my head.
don't worry.
you know, something's got to give.
there's got to be a ransom demand.
someone will spot this Elizabeth.
something will break. It always does.
hello.
Hi. You're at home?
I- I called your office, I called your cell.
it's a long story.
are you okay? You sound upset.
do you hear that?
hear what?
nothing. I- I don't hear it now.
Hey, listen, um, what music store did you rent Bridgette's clarinet from?
I promised her that I'd get her a new reed on the way home from school.
Marshall's. I got it at Marshall's.
there it is again. Do you hear it?
no.
Marshall's, huh?
Allison, are you all right?
Yeah. Honey, I'm fine.
I'll see you when you get home.
baby?
shh, I'm here now, honey.
what do you want, honey?
something you want in the garage?
it's the car.
it's the car.
you wanted to be in the car?
Oh, my God, I'm talking to a picture.
you want to go for a ride, don't you?
okay.
wait right here, I'm gonna get my purse and my keys.
bridge, what are you doing?
put that back!
don't play with that.
that's not yours. - Okay.
come on, help me find a reed.
okay, what size are we looking for?
one, one and a half?
she with you two?
how long has she been playing?
what are you talking about?
she can't play.
which house is it?
what, did I pass it?
Hello?
Hello, is anybody home?
I hope you know what you're getting us into.
Hello?
is anybody home?
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.
I'd like to ask you some questions about a missing baby.
what is it now?
baby?
baby?
keep crying, I'm gonna find you, I'm here!
come on, you gotta tell me how you did that.
I don't know how I did it.
just leave me alone.
okay, one half hour of TV then homework, okay?
Hi, I gotta talk to you.
I need to talk to you, too.
okay, you first.
no, no, no. You go. What's going on?
okay, I took the kids to an early dinner, like you suggested, but something happened in the music store.
something that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
now I'm thinking maybe you should go first.
what is that?
it's a baby!
Yeah, no, I sussed that part out.
what is it doing here?
come on, little sweetie.
Oh, I don't even know how to start explaining this.
okay, well, any effort you make will be much appreciated.
right, well, the short version is his name is Bryce Carlo.
his housekeeper kidnapped him this morning and I found him.
okay, and what?
we're, like, waiting for the police to come get him?
I haven't called the police.
because...?
because I'm not sure I'm supposed to.
Oh, okay, yeah, I can help you with this.
you're supposed to.
no, you don't understand.
there's something about this little boy.
from the moment I heard that he was gone.
from the moment I saw his picture,
I knew I was supposed to look for him.
I was supposed to find him.
and now I think I'm supposed to keep him.
Allison, he has parents.
Yeah, I know, I met them.
but they're probably frantic.
well, his father is concerned but his mother is oddly calm.
what are you talking about, oddly calm?
she's probably in shock.
and what difference does that make?
it's her baby.
just because you took him from a kidnapper doesn't make you any less of a kidnapper.
no, you're wrong! You don't understand.
he's supposed to be here; he's supposed to be with me.
Oh, look!
he's smiling! He knows I'm right!
he's smiling, that's your proof?
that's your answer, he's smiling?
he's a baby! They all smile.
that's standard equipment on a baby- that's what they do.
Allison, people go to jail for this for a very long time.
what are you doing?
I'm trying to protect you from yourself.
I'm gonna try and reach somebody
a friend on the phone- Scanlon or Devalos.
somebody who can take this baby back to its rightful parents.
No! - Hey, yes!
you already have children.
and they don't want to only see you on visitor's day.
Hey. - Hi.
sorry. I know I'm late, but it was so hard to leave her.
she kept looking at me like I was abandoning her.
I know it's tough, but it's good practice for next week, when you go back to work.
okay, and I don't want to think about that tonight.
a drink for madam?
Yeah. She will have a martini with...
no, no, no. Breastfeeding, breastfeeding, breastfeeding.
sorry, sorry, sorry.
we will have a bottle of your finest water.
thank you.
so how'd she check out?
sorry. Who?
the baby-sitter.
you were gonna run her license.
Lynn, she's 17. She's, uh, clean as a whistle.
what are you doing? - I'm texting her.
baby's not used to getting milk from a bottle from a stranger.
I just need to make sure everything's going okay.
and would we like to hear the specials for tonight?
not me. I can't really eat anything.
what?
well, I've got to get this baby weight off.
nothing fits me.
I hate the way I look.
you look fantastic, and you have to eat something.
could you give us a few minutes?
what are you doing?
she hasn't texted back.
you just texted her.
you just texted her.
besides, maybe she's taking care of the baby.
she can't text you if she's taking care of the baby.
and I also know that the whole idea of tonight is for the two of us to have a good time, to get your mind off the baby and relax.
all right?
what's going on? Are you all right?
Yeah, I think I had my phone on, uh, vibrate.
Scanlon here.
well, I'm just kind of in the middle of something.
Yes, sir.
you got it.
I know that look.
the Carlo case- there's, uh, been a breakthrough.
I'll see you at home?
Yeah, I'll see you at home.
obviously, the most important thing is that Bryce is home safely.
we'll let you know more as it develops, but that's all for now. Thank you.
it's okay. You did the right thing.
you know you did the right thing.
okay, mission accomplished.
as far as the Carlos are concerned,
Allison led Lee to their son.
Thanks. - Thanks.
I don't understand.
what was Bryce doing in that strange house all alone?
we don't know yet.
Yeah, the house is owned by a woman named Maribella Gomez.
she freely admits that she's friends with the housekeeper, Elizabeth Torres, but has no idea what's going on.
she wasn't home when Elizabeth came by to stash the baby.
has no idea why she would have broken into her house, no idea where she is now.
listen, Allison, if you're up to it, the Carlos would like to thank you personally.
I know it sounds crazy, but if I can't hold him, protect him...
maybe some other time.
Oh, geez.
it's Bryce's.
I guess somehow we missed it.
come on.
give it to me.
come on, I got to get rid of it.
and Allison, I'm not trying to be mean, but that blanket is- it's evidence that Bryce was here, that he was in our house, so...
come on, I gotta have it.
I gotta burn it or something.
it's okay. I'll do it.
I will; I'll do it.
in the morning.
Oh, my goodness.
I am so thrilled that you stopped by.
I was so worried I wouldn't get a chance to thank you.
I know I must have seemed a little crazy yesterday, talking about how much I trusted Elizabeth, even though she took my baby.
it's just, sometimes things are so awful, it's like your brain can't take them in.
no, I completely understand.
I can't imagine what I would do if I woke up and one of my babies was gone.
well, speaking of which, where's Bryce?
I'd really love to see him.
I kind of miss that little guy.
well, actually, you just missed him.
my husband Scott took him over to his grandparents for a little while.
Oh, well, that's nice.
maybe I could just hang out till they get back.
well, that's probably Scott now.
let me just see when he plans on heading back.
are you the lady who brought my brother back?
I wish you hadn't done that.
he's not safe here.
I'm afraid Scott and Bryce will be gone all... day.
it caught my eye.
that's Lucy.
she would've been six.
she fell ill last year and, uh, died very suddenly.
I'm so sorry.
be a year at Christmas.
I don't know if you heard me, Scott and Bryce...
uh, they'll be gone all day.
well, give Bryce a- a hug for me.
and thank you for the tea.
no, thank you.
thank you for everything.
um, actually, Mrs. Lovett, I wasn't calling about Bridgette.
um, I was calling about our six-year-old.
um, I was wondering if-if, uh, she could get music lessons, too, you know?
maybe, uh, we could- we could do them, uh, back-to-back or...?
you don't have any openings?
Oh, wow, that's too bad.
could we, uh
could we maybe get on a wait list or...?
she can have mine!
sorry, hold on one second.
what's that, Bridge?
my lesson.
she can have it.
it's at 4: 00 tomorrow.
I... don't... want it.
she can have it!
go away. I'm busy.
sorry, coming in anyway.
Hi.
look, I know you got homework, but you have to clear something up for me.
I thought I heard you say you wanted to quit clarinet.
Yeah, so, what's the difference?
I stink at it, anyways.
what are you talking about?
you've only been at it for two weeks.
Yeah, and Marie's been playing for, like, two minutes.
and she's already great.
come on, you can't do that.
you can't compare yourself to Marie.
I mean, I don't know what is going on there, but that girl clearly has a special aptitude for the clarinet.
but I don't.
Bridgette, you are already one of the most special people in the whole wide world.
really. Now, anybody who knows you would say that.
no, you're wrong.
nobody's ever said that.
except you.
just now.
and only because you're my Dad.
I don't believe that.
Yeah, well, it's true.
you know who I am?
I'm everybody's sister.
that's not true.
yeah? Well, I'm Ariel's sister, because she's smart and she's pretty, and everybody likes her.
and she knows about clothes and-and boys and dancing.
and... now, I guess I'm Marie's sister, too.
cause she can play clarinet without even trying.
come here.
no, it absolutely it just broke my heart, you know.
she just seemed so defeated by it.
do you hear me?
Hey, Allison?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
where are you?
what are you so busy thinking about?
look, don't be mad.
I went to see him today. I brought him his blanket.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
I'm trying to talk to you about your own child.
he had a sister.
had.
she died a few months ago.
she said that Bryce wasn't safe in that house.
that I shouldn't have brought him back there.
what, the dead sister told you this?
look, I checked her death records.
it said "unexplained illnesses, natural causes."
apparently, they took her to expert after expert.
no one could really put their finger on it.
what are you saying?
well, I'm saying something's wrong in that house.
the sister said that Bryce wasn't safe there.
the mother said the housekeeper lived for him.
so, I'm starting to think maybe she didn't kidnap him at all, maybe she was trying to protect him.
maybe someone or something in that house killed the sister, and now it's trying to harm Bryce.
what are you doing?
I can't do this.
I can't spend another ounce of energy on this thing.
I spent last night running all over hell's half acre.
Hey, you asked me what was in my head. - The little boy is home safe - I'm telling you what's in my head. - with his parents.
our little girl is beside herself in her room.
Joe? - Huh? Yeah? What?
you have a dream? What's going on, Allison?
that, do you hear that?
what? Hear what?
I listened for- Oh, Allison, look, it's almost 1: 30 in the morning.
no, that, that. That baby crying.
what are you - there's no baby crying.
what are you talking about?
we don't have a baby.
it's him. It's Bryce.
he needs me. I'm going over there.
going where?
to the Carlos'.
I need to make sure he's okay.
Hey! Are you listening to yourself?
it's-it's the middle of the night.
I don't care! He's in trouble.
he needs me.
for crap's sake.
help you?
Mr. Carlo, I-I...
we met the other day. I was with Detective Scanlon.
this is my husband Joe.
look, I know it's the middle of the night;
I- I know this is really unusual, but I was wondering if I could just look in on Bryce.
What-what's going on? What are you doing here?
this...
this... hard to explain.
I just- I need to see Bryce.
I just- I need to know that he's okay.
why wouldn't he be okay?
Oh, no, no.
did we do that? The doorbell?
no, no, this is pretty much par for the course.
well, as long as that's the case.
I mean, if he's up, is there any way that I can just see him?
Oh, he's such a beautiful boy.
your little girl never got to meet him, did she?
I got pregnant just before she passed.
I know Scott was worried that I was so filled with grief that I might lose him.
I can't imagine what it would be like to go through that.
well, the hardest part was never getting any answers.
never knowing what was wrong.
I mean, the only thing everyone seemed to agree on was that she was dying.
did you ever consider getting an autopsy, so you would know why?
uh, no.
Lucy suffered too much.
we couldn't put her through that, too.
and, ultimately, an autopsy would've just been for our benefit, not hers.
we just wanted her to rest in peace.
I just don't understand why they wouldn't get an autopsy.
I mean, if one of our girls died...?
Allison, you have to stop.
that family opened their door to us at 3: 00 in the morning.
they're not evil.
if anything, they're saints.
okay, I'm not saying they're not nice,
I just - I think it's strange... Strange?
strange? You want to talk about strange?
look, I hate to break it to you, but the only thing strange about that house tonight was the fact that we were in it.
now, you have to leave that family alone.
I mean it.
go away. I'm tired.
Yeah, well, too bad.
it's time to get up.
well, I haven't even been to sleep yet.
what are you talking about? It's morning.
you've been asleep all night.
Uh-uh. Not really. I've been dreaming.
dreaming about that stupid song.
what are you talking about?
you dream that song?
there's this old man and he has a clarinet.
and all he does is play that song over and over again.
showed me how to do it.
I hate it.
well, I don't know what to tell you.
why are you even telling me all this?
because you're my big sister.
when you brought him in, did anyone run any blood work, anything that could test for toxins in his system?
sure.
blood tests are fairly routine in child abduction cases.
we look for sedatives, tranquilizers.
the good news is, in Bryce's case, everything came back completely normal.
Yeah.
okay.
I'll be right there.
that was the morgue.
seems a sanitation worker found a corpse stuffed in an abandoned refrigerator in one of our municipal landfills early this morning.
matches the description of our missing kidnapper, Elizabeth Torres.
Yes.
that's her.
that's my cousin.
thank you for coming down and making the identification.
I may have a few more questions. If want to just wait outside?
M. E.'s calling cause of death blunt-force trauma.
looks like she took a couple of hard blows to the head.
hard enough to kill her.
doesn't make a lot of sense.
this woman takes a baby boy, you find the baby boy, then someone kills the kidnapper?
something's missing.
like what?
to begin with, I still can't figure out why this woman took that child, only to abandon him at the house where Allison found him.
might make sense to have forensics go back, see if they can find any of this woman's blood.
all right, girls.
Hey, girls, come on.
it's time to leave for Marie's music lesson.
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.
Marie wanted me to tell you that she doesn't want to go to her lesson.
What?! Why?
all right, sweetheart.
all good?
okay, come on.
she okay?
well, not yet, but eventually.
this is one of those things, isn't it?
uh, yes, yes.
this definitely appears to be one of those things.
so, how do we fix it?
how do we make her stop hearing that song?
I don't know, Bridge.
I honestly- I don't know.
from my experience with mom and with Ariel and even with you, it's best to just let these things run their course.
Hello?
Allison, I, uh, I hope I didn't wake you.
I just called to let you know that the police went back out to that house where you found the Carlo boy.
they actually found a small spot of blood on the underside of a doorknob.
the blood matched some blood that we found on Elizabeth Torres's body
blood that wasn't hers.
so, while we don't yet have a suspect, the good news is, once we do, we have enough forensic evidence to nail him for murder.
anyway, I'm, uh...
I'm going to go home, go to bed.
you do that, sir.
it's 1: 00 a. m.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry to have wake you and Scott.
Scott's not here.
he's out of town on business.
look, I'm sorry, Dana.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
you're a nice person.
I need you to understand everything that I am doing,
I am doing for Bryce.
what-what are you talking about?
what are you doing for Bryce?
I hope you're not going to ask to see him again.
no, I don't need to just see him.
I need to take him.
Bryce needs to be with me!
okay, Allison, you need to leave.
I'm serious.
you're not welcome here.
Bryce isn't going to be with you.
that's just never going to happen.
Hi. Hello.
Hey, it's me. I'm fine.
you're fine? You're fine?
Allison, I'm calling you, like, 35 times.
did you turn off your cell phone?
I had to throw it away.
I knew they were going to use it to try to track me down.
look, I just want you to know that I'm safe.
I can't tell you where we are, but we're safe.
but you're not.
the whole state of Arizona is looking for you.
they got AMBER alerts and APBs.
I beg you, turn yourself in.
now!
if we're lucky, all they're charge you with is assault.
I can't.
I can't explain it.
it's just... I know.
for now he's supposed to be with me.
but he's not.
Allison, please, tell me where you are.
tell me at least you have a plan.
there's no plan.
he had to sleep, eat.
I need to sleep. Honey, I have to get off the phone.
I know that they're probably tracing our home number.
I love you. I love the girls.
I'll see you soon.
it's Elizabeth.
please. I'm in trouble.
I need help.
I know you're here!
Elizabeth? - Primo!
primo, what are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
you know exactly what I'm doing here.
you think you could just cut me out of my own plan?
no.
no, you're wrong. I... I would never...
you would never what? What, you never what?
no, no, I did everything you asked.
I gave you the alarm code.
I took pictures.
Yes, you were a good cousin.
you did everything you were supposed to.
maybe too much.
no.
Yes. - No.
Yes. How else do you explain it?
this morning when Martin and I were supposed to kidnap the baby, we find out he's already gone.
Alberto... - And then the TV.
they're saying the person who took it was you.
I want that baby!
I'm sorry, Alberto, he's not here.
I don't have him anymore.
I gave him to Mirabella. She's gone to the police.
she's going to tell them everything.
you're lying!
No!
it's the truth.
I don't lie.
not like you lied to me.
martin told me he told me you were never going to give that baby back, even if they paid the ransom.
that you were going to sell him for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
I could never be a part of that.
you cannot really be my cousin.
you are not even human.
ma'am, you're under arrest.
I'm gonna need you to put your hands on your head and surrender the child.
I'm so sorry that I sprayed you in the eyes.
I just had a conversation with the man you work for
the district attorney.
he explained to me that I have every right to prosecute you for kidnapping Bryce, assaulting me.
every right to send you to prison for a very long time.
but, uh...
...he also confessed that he thought that would be a huge mistake.
and then he talked to me about you and your dreams.
he told me it was a dream of yours that led police to the man who killed our nanny.
that once they brought him in, he confessed.
he told them that after you had brought Bryce back to me and Scott,
alberto and his partner realized they still had the alarm code.
they still had everything they needed to go through with the kidnapping.
they even had my husband's travel schedule, which is why last night, shortly after you assaulted me and took my son, they came to my house.
Oh, my God.
if you hadn't taken Bryce, it appears they would have.
they-they pulled up to our house and found police cars in our driveway.
police cars that were there because of you, Mrs. Dubois;
because you'd taken my little boy.
now maybe it was just a coincidence, but I prefer to believe this...
this thing you have, this gift... it forced you to keep Bryce safe.
and that's what I prefer to believe.
you're not going to prosecute me?
I told your boss that my memory of last night is faulty.
I'm not comfortable testifying about what happened.
Oh, thank you.
stay away from my house, Allison.
stay away from my family.
if-if I ever see you again, my memory may very well improve, do you understand?
I understand.
but it's not going to be a problem.
I was there when Bryce needed me.
but I think for the rest of his life, one mother is plenty.
excuse me.
can u tell me the name of that song?
it doesn't have a name, actually.
I wrote it.
well, me and my dad anyway.
I'm Mr. Bronson, by the way.
and who are you?
nice to meet you, Bridgette Dubois.
Yeah, this song doesn't have a name
cause it doesn't have an ending.
we never finished it.
I was working on it with my father when he, uh...
he passed away suddenly.
wait right here.
I think I know someone you're gonna want to meet.
Hey, Allison?
are you hearing this?
what the...
whose baby is that? And where's Ariel?
Joe, keep your voice down.
Where's our daughter?
she's right here.
Ariel's right here.
Oh, Joe.
my God, Joe, it's Bridgette and Marie.
it can't be.
how is that possible?
come on, Al, help me make sense of this.
I think maybe it's my fault.
I've been wishing for it secretly.
okay. I get it. You're upset.
but don't you think you're being a little bit immature?
so, listen...
what do you think about having another baby?
Oh, that's nice.
she's practicing.
make it stop!
I'm begging you to make it stop.
Hey, she's your sister, she's been at this all of two weeks, and this is important to her.
what she really needs is your encouragement.
and she's got it.
I'm encouraging her to stop.
great. I was just getting the hang of it, and the reed breaks.
bridge, okay, come over here.
we'll get you another one.
have some breakfast.
that really stinks. I wanted Mommy to hear me play.
don't worry about it. Mommy isn't even here.
she got a ride with Detective Scanlon this morning.
do me a favor. Go get dressed.
I'll make you something to eat in the car.
and you promise that we'll go down to the music shop and get me a new reed right after school?
absolutely, I promise.
Oh, Lee, she's so beautiful.
Thanks.
so, how's Lynn adjusting?
there was no adjusting. It was instant.
the second little Lee came into the world, bam, she was a mom.
what is it with you women and kids? It's like a drug.
it is pretty amazing.
I woke up this morning convinced that I had to have another one.
Oh, I don't know what came over mere.
what did Joe have to say about that?
nothing. He pretended he was asleep.
Yeah. Well, it's different for guys.
it's an adjustment.
a great adjustment; a fantastic adjustment; but an adjustment.
tomorrow night's date night.
I finally convinced her to get a sitter, leave little Lee for a couple hours.
big step.
are you excited?
I'm excited. She's terrified.
detective, advise your 20. I've got a Code Two in Fountain Hills.
so you woke up... uh, what time?
6: 45, give or take?
the baby's just gone?
housekeeper's just vanished?
he's not in the nursery, she's not in her room.
her room? She has a room?
she stays here five nights a week in case the baby fusses or wakes up during the night.
and his name is Bryce?
Bryce, yes.
and, uh, that's a very recent photo-- last weekend.
here's a picture of Elizabeth.
the housekeeper. You said her last name was, uh, Torres.
Yes.
and during the night, you didn't hear anything?
uh, the baby didn't cry or anything, so, you have no idea what time this happened?
no.
how about your wife? Did she hear anything?
obviously, no.
so, is this it? Is it just you two?
a forensic team and some more detectives are on their way.
we'll get these to every media outlet in the area.
we'll get a description of the car up on Amber Alert.
can I speak with Mrs. Carlo?
uh, of course. She was just... putting on some clothes.
she'll be, uh... She'll be down in a minute.
is the nursery upstairs?
Yes.
do you mind if I take a look?
no.
I'll be up in a bit. I'm gonna talk to the mother, and I want to be here when the rest of the cavalry shows up.
should I not be in here?
I see you're wearing gloves.
I shouldn't be in here, right? I might ruin some clues or something?
Mrs. Carlo?
Dana.
you're with the police?
my name is Allison.
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.
we're gonna find him.
wherever she went, wherever she took him, w-we're gonna find him.
I'm not worried.
I mean, of course I'm worried, but...
I also know that there's no one on the planet that loves Bryce as much as I do, except Elizabeth.
she worships him.
she lives for him, and that's how I know.
that's how I know he's okay.
but you do believe that she took him?
well, maybe she did, and maybe she didn't.
I mean, maybe this is all a dream, a nightmare.
in a little while, I'll wake up, and Elizabeth will be downstairs holding Bryce, and we'll sing songs and play games, and it'll just be another day.
what do you think the chances are that this address for Elizabeth Torres is good?
that we knock on the door, she opens it?
that the baby's there, asleep peacefully in a laundry basket?
ms. Torres, it's the police.
if you don't open up on the count of three, we're coming in.
okay, home before lunch.
nice work if you can get it.
Allison, you okay?
Yeah.
no, I'm fine.
are you sure?
it's that little baby. I can't get it out of my head.
don't worry. Uh, you know, something's got to give.
there's got to be a ransom demand.
someone will spot this Elizabeth. Something will break. It always does.
you're at home?
I-I called your office. I called your cell.
it's a long story.
are you okay? You sound upset.
do you hear that?
hear what?
nothing. I-I don't hear it now.
Hey, listen, um, what music store did you rent Bridgette's clarinet from?
I promised her that I'd get her a new reed on the way home from school.
uh, Marshall's. I got it at Marshall's.
there it is again. Do you hear it?
no.
Marshall's, huh?
Allison, are you all right?
Yeah. Honey, I'm fine.
I'll see you when you get home.
baby?
shh, I'm here now, honey.
what do you want, honey?
something you want in the garage?
it's the car.
it's the car.
you wanted to be in the car?
Oh, my God. I'm talking to a picture.
you want to go for a ride, don't you?
okay.
wait right here, I'm gonna get my purse and my keys.
bridge, what are you doing? Put that back!
don't play with that. That's not yours.
okay.
come on, help me find a reed.
okay, what size are we looking for?
one, one and a half?
she with you two?
how long has she been playing?
what are you talking about?
she can't play.
which house is it?
what, did I pass it?
Hello, is anybody home?
I hope you know what you're getting us into.
is anybody home?
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.
I'd like to ask you some questions about a missing baby.
what is it now?
baby?
baby?
keep crying, I'm gonna find you. I'm here!
it's you, Bryce, isn't it?
come on, you gotta tell me how you did that.
I don't know how I did it.
just leave me alone.
okay, one half hour of TV then homework, okay?
Hi, I gotta talk to you.
I need to talk to you, too.
okay, you first.
no, no, no. You go. What's going on?
okay, I took the kids to an early dinner, like you suggested, but something happened in the music store.
something that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
now I'm thinking maybe you should go first.
what is that?
it's a baby!
Yeah, no, I sussed that part out.
what is it doing here?
come on, little sweetie.
Oh, I don't even know how to start explaining this.
okay, well, any effort you make will be much appreciated.
right, well, the short version is his name is Bryce Carlo.
his housekeeper kidnapped him this morning and I found him.
okay, and what?
we're, like, waiting for the police to come get him?
I haven't called the police.
because...
because I'm not sure I'm supposed to.
Oh, okay, yeah, I can help you with this.
you're supposed to.
no, you don't understand.
there's something about this little boy.
from the moment I heard that he was gone.
from the moment I saw his picture, I knew I was supposed to look for him.
I was supposed to find him.
and now I think I'm supposed to keep him.
Allison, he has parents.
Yeah, I know, I met them.
but they're probably frantic.
well, his father is concerned but his mother is oddly calm.
what are you talking about, oddly calm?
she's probably in shock.
and what difference does that make?
it's her baby.
just because you took him from a kidnapper doesn't make you any less of a kidnapper.
no, you're wrong! You don't understand.
he's supposed to be here; he's supposed to be with me.
Oh, look! He's smiling! He knows I'm right!
he's smiling. That's your proof?
that's your answer. He's smiling?
he's a baby!
they all smile.
that's standard equipment on a baby-- that's what they do.
Allison, people go to jail for this for a very long time.
what are you doing?
I'm trying to protect you from yourself.
I'm gonna try and reach somebody-- a friend on the phone-- Scanlon or Devalos.
somebody who can take this baby back to its rightful parents.
No! - Hey, yes!
you already have children.
and they don't want to only see you on visitor's day.
sorry. I know I'm late, but it was so hard to leave her.
she kept looking at me like I was abandoning her.
I know it's tough, but it's good practice for next week, when you go back to work.
okay, and I don't want to think about that tonight.
a drink for madam?
Yeah. She will have a martini with...
no, no, no.
sorry, sorry, sorry. We will have a bottle of your finest water.
thank you.
so how'd she check out?
sorry. Who?
the baby-sitter. You were gonna run her license.
Lynn, she's 17. She's, uh, clean as a whistle.
what are you doing?
I'm texting her.
baby's not used to getting milk from a bottle from a stranger.
I just need to make sure everything's going okay.
and would we like to hear the specials for tonight?
not me. I can't really eat anything.
what?
well, I've got to get this baby weight off.
nothing fits me.
I hate the way I look.
you look fantastic, and you have to eat something.
could you give us a few minutes?
Thanks.
what are you doing?
she hasn't texted back.
you just texted her.
you just texted her.
besides, maybe she's taking care of the baby.
she can't text you if she's taking care of the baby.
and I also know that the whole idea of tonight is for the two of us to have a good time, to get your mind off the baby and relax.
all right?
what's going on? Are you all right?
Yeah, I think I had my phone on, uh, vibrate.
Scanlon here.
well, I'm just kind of in the middle of something.
Yes, sir. You got it.
I know that look.
the Carlo case--he's, uh, been a breakthrough.
I'll see you at home?
Yeah, I'll see you at home.
obviously, the most important thing is that Bryce is home safely.
we'll let you know more as it develops, but that's all for now.
thank you.
it's okay. You did the right thing.
you know you did the right thing.
okay, mission accomplished.
as far as the Carlos are concerned, Allison led Lee to their son.
Thanks.
I don't understand.
what was Bryce doing in that strange house all alone?
we don't know yet.
Yeah, the house is owned by a woman named Maribella Gomez.
she freely admits that she's friends with the housekeeper, Elizabeth Torres, but has no idea what's going on.
she wasn't home when Elizabeth came by to stash the baby.
has no idea why she would have broken into her house, no idea where she is now.
listen, Allison, if you're up to it, the Carlos would like to thank you personally.
I know it sounds crazy, but if I can't hold him, protect him...
maybe some other time.
Oh, geez.
it's Bryce's.
I guess somehow we missed it.
come on. Give it to me.
come on, I got to get rid of it.
and Allison, I'm not trying to be mean, but that blanket is -
it's evidence that Bryce was here, that he was in our house, so...
come on, I gotta have it. I gotta burn it or something.
it's okay. I'll do it.
I will; I'll do it.
in the morning.
Oh, my goodness.
I am so thrilled that you stopped by.
I was so worried I wouldn't get a chance to thank you.
I know I must have seemed a little crazy yesterday, talking about how much I trusted Elizabeth, even though she took my baby.
it's just, sometimes things are so awful, it's like your brain can't take them in.
no, I completely understand.
I can't imagine what I would do if I woke up and one of my babies was gone.
well, speaking of which, where's Bryce?
I'd really love to see him.
I kind of miss that little guy.
well, actually, you just missed him.
my husband Scott took him over to his grandparents for a little while.
Oh, well, that's nice.
well, maybe I could just hang out till they get back.
well, that's probably Scott now.
uh, let me just see when he plans on heading back.
are you the lady who brought my brother back?
I wish you hadn't done that.
he's not safe here.
I'm afraid Scott and Bryce will be gone all... day.
it caught my eye.
that's Lucy.
she would've been six.
she fell ill last year and, uh, died very suddenly.
I'm so sorry.
be a year at Christmas.
I don't know if you heard me, Scott and Bryce...
uh, they'll be gone all day.
well, give Bryce a-a hug for me.
and thank you for the tea.
no, thank you.
thank you for everything.
um, actually, Mrs. Lovett, I wasn't calling about Bridgette.
um, I was calling about our six-year-old.
um, I was wondering if-if, uh, she could get music lessons, too, you know?
maybe, uh, we could-- we could do them, uh, back-to-back or...
you don't have any openings?
Oh, wow, that's too bad.
could we, uh-- could we maybe get on a wait list or...
she can have mine!
sorry, hold on one second.
what's that, Bridge?
my lesson. She can have it.
it's at 4: 00 tomorrow.
I don't want it.
but that's your lesson, Bridge.
I...don't... want it.
she can have it!
go away. I'm busy.
sorry, coming in anyway.
look, I know you got homework, but you have to clear something up for me.
I thought I heard you say you wanted to quit clarinet.
Yeah, so, what's the difference?
I stink at it, anyways.
what are you talking about? You've only been at it for two weeks.
Yeah, and Marie's been playing for, like, two minutes.
and she's already great.
come on, you can't do that.
you can't compare yourself to Marie.
I mean, I don't know what is going on there, but that girl clearly has a special aptitude for the clarinet.
but I don't.
Bridgette, you are already one of the most special people in the whole wide world. Really.
now, anybody who knows you would say that.
no, you're wrong.
nobody's ever said that.
except you.
just now.
and only because you're my Dad.
I don't believe that.
Yeah, well, it's true.
you know who I am?
I'm everybody's sister.
that's not true.
yeah?
well, I'm Ariel's sister, because she's smart and she's pretty, and everybody likes her.
and she knows about clothes and-and boys and dancing.
and... now, I guess I'm Marie's sister, too.
cause she can play clarinet without even trying.
come here.
no, it absolutely-- it just broke my heart, you know.
she just seemed so defeated by it.
do you hear me?
Hey, Allison?
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
where are you?
what are you so busy thinking about?
look, don't be mad.
I went to see him today. I brought him his blanket.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
I'm trying to talk to you about your own child.
he had a sister. Had.
she died a few months ago.
she said that Bryce wasn't safe in that house.
that I shouldn't have brought him back there.
what, the dead sister told you this?
look, I checked her death records.
it said "unexplained illnesses, natural causes.
apparently, they took her to expert after expert.
no one could really put their finger on it.
what are you saying?
well, I'm saying something's wrong in that house.
the sister said that Bryce wasn't safe there.
the mother said the housekeeper lived for him.
so, I'm starting to think maybe she didn't kidnap him at all, maybe she was trying to protect him.
maybe someone or something in that house killed the sister, and now it's trying to harm Bryce.
what are you doing?
I can't do this.
I can't spend another ounce of energy on this thing.
I spent last night running all over hell's half acre.
Hey, you asked me what was in my head. I'm telling you what's in my head. - The little boy is home safe with his parents.
our little girl is beside herself in her room.
yeah? What?
you have a dream?
what's going on, Allison?
that, do you hear that?
what? Hear what?
I listened for-- Oh, Allison, look, it's almost 1: 30 in the morning.
no, that, that. That baby crying.
what are you-- there's no baby crying.
what are you talking about?
we don't have a baby.
it's him. It's Bryce.
he needs me. I'm going over there.
going where?
to the Carlos'.
I need to make sure he's okay.
are you listening to yourself?
it's-it's the middle of the night.
I don't care! He's in trouble. He needs me.
Aw, for crap's sake.
help you?
Mr. Carlo, I-I... We met the other day.
I was with Detective Scanlon. This is my husband Joe.
look, I know it's the middle of the night; I-I know this is really unusual, but I was wondering if I could just look in on Bryce.
What-what's going on? What are you doing here?
this... this... hard to explain.
I just-- I need to see Bryce.
I just-- I need to know that he's okay.
why wouldn't he be okay?
Oh, no, no. Did we do that? The doorbell?
no, no, this is pretty much par for the course.
well, as long as that's the case.
I mean, if he's up, is there any way that I can just see him?
Oh, he's such a beautiful boy.
your little girl never got to meet him, did she?
I got pregnant just before she passed.
I know Scott was worried that I was so filled with grief that I might lose him.
I can't imagine what it would be like to go through that.
well, the hardest part was never getting any answers.
never knowing what was wrong.
I mean, the only thing everyone seemed to agree on was that she was dying.
did you ever consider getting an autopsy, so you would know why?
uh, no.
Lucy suffered too much.
we couldn't put her through that, too.
and, ultimately, an autopsy would've just been for our benefit, not hers.
we just wanted her to rest in peace.
I just don't understand why they wouldn't get an autopsy.
I mean, if one of our girls died...
Allison, you have to stop.
that family opened their door to us at 3: 00 in the morning.
they're not evil.
if anything, they're saints.
okay, I'm not saying they're not nice, I just-- I think it's strange...
strange? You want to talk about strange?
look, I hate to break it to you, but the only thing strange about that house tonight was the fact that we were in it.
now, you have to leave that family alone.
I mean it.
go away. I'm tired.
Yeah, well, too bad. It's time to get up.
well, I haven't even been to sleep yet.
what are you talking about? It's morning.
you've been asleep all night.
not really. I've been dreaming.
dreaming about that stupid song.
what are you talking about?
you dream that song?
there's this old man and he has a clarinet.
and all he does is play that song over and over again.
showed me how to do it.
I hate it.
well, I don't know what to tell you.
why are you even telling me all this?
because you're my big sister.
sir, I-I was wanting to ask you about Bryce Carlo.
when you brought him in, did anyone run any blood work, anything that could test for toxins in his system?
sure.
blood tests are fairly routine in child abduction cases.
we look for sedatives, tranquilizers.
the good news is, in Bryce's case, everything came back completely normal.
Yeah.
okay.
I'll be right there.
that was the morgue.
seems a sanitation worker found a corpse stuffed in an abandoned refrigerator in one of our municipal landfills earl
matches the description of our missing kidnapper, Elizabeth Torres.
Yes.
that's her.
that's my cousin.
thank you for coming down and making the identification.
I may have a few more questions. If want to just wait outside?
M. E.'s calling cause of death blunt-force trauma.
looks like she took a couple of hard blows to the head.
hard enough to kill her.
doesn't make a lot of sense.
this woman takes a baby boy, you find the baby boy, then someone kills the kidnapper?
something's missing.
like what?
to begin with, I still can't figure out why this woman took that child, only to abandon him at the house where Allison found him.
might make sense to have forensics go back, see if they can find any of this woman's blood.
all right, girls.
Hey, girls, come on.
it's time to leave for Marie's music lesson.
Hey, Dad?
Yeah.
Marie wanted me to tell you that she doesn't want to go to her lesson.
What?! Why?
she okay?
Yeah. Well, not yet, but eventually.
this is one of those things, isn't it?
uh, yes, yes. This definitely appears to be one of those things.
so, how do we fix it?
how do we make her stop hearing that song?
I don't know, Bridge. I honestly-- I don't know.
from my experience with mom and with Ariel and even with you, it's best to just let these things run their course.
Allison, I,uh, I hope I didn't wake you.
I just called to let you know that the police went back out to that house where you found the Carlo boy.
they actually found a small spot of blood on the underside of a doorknob.
the blood matched some blood that we found on Elizabeth Torres's body-- blood that wasn't hers.
so, while we don't yet have a suspect, the good news is, once we do, we have enough forensic evidence to nail him for murder.
anyway, I'm, uh... I'm going to go home, go to bed.
you do that, sir.
it's 1: 00 a. m.
I know, I know. I'm sorry to have wake you and Scott.
Scott's not here. He's out of town on business.
look, I'm sorry, Dana.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
you're a nice person.
I need you to understand everything that I am doing, I am doing for Bryce.
what-what are you talking about?
what are you doing for Bryce?
I hope you're not going to ask to see him again.
no, I don't need to just see him. I need to take him.
Bryce needs to be with me!
okay, Allison, you need to leave. I'm serious.
you're not welcome here.
Bryce isn't going to be with you. That's just never going to happen.
Hey, it's me. I'm fine.
you're fine? You're fine?
Allison, I'm calling you, like, 35 times.
did you turn off your cell phone?
I had to throw it away.
I knew they were going to use it to try to track me down.
look, I just want you to know that I'm safe.
I can't tell you where we are, but we're safe.
but you're not.
the whole state of Arizona is looking for you.
they got AMBER alerts and APBs.
I beg you, turn yourself in.
now!
if we're lucky, all they're charge you with is assault.
I can't. I can't explain it.
it's just... I know.
for now he's supposed to be with me.
but he's not.
Allison, please, tell me where you are.
tell me at least you have a plan.
there's no plan.
he had to sleep, eat. I need to sleep.
honey, I have to get off the phone.
I know that they're probably tracing our home number.
I love you.
I love the girls.
I'll see you soon.
it's Elizabeth.
please.
I'm in trouble.
I need help.
I know you're here!
Primo!
primo, what are you doing here?
what am I doing here?
you know exactly what I'm doing here.
you think you could just cut me out of my own plan?
no. No, you're wrong.
I...I would never...
you would never what?
what, you never what?
no, no, I did everything you asked.
I gave you the alarm code.
I took pictures.
Yes, you were a good cousin.
you did everything you were supposed to.
maybe too much.
no. - Yes.
no. - Yes. How else do you explain it?
this morning when Martin and I were supposed to kidnap the baby, we find out he's already gone.
and then the TV.
they're saying the person who took it was you.
I want that baby!
I'm sorry, Alberto. He's not here.
I don't have him anymore.
I gave him to Mirabella.
she's gone to the police.
she's going to tell them everything.
you're lying!
No!
it's the truth. I don't lie.
not like you lied to me.
martin told me-- he told me you were never going to give that baby back, even if they paid the ransom.
that you were going to sell him for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
I could never be a part of that.
you cannot really be my cousin.
you are not even human.
ma'am, you're under arrest.
I'm gonna need you to put your hands on your head and surrender the child.
I'm so sorry that I sprayed you in the eyes.
I just had a conversation with the man you work for-- the district attorney.
he explained to me that I have every right to prosecute you for kidnapping Bryce, assaulting me.
every right to send you to prison for a very long time.
but, uh...he also confessed that he thought that would be a huge mistake.
and then he talked to me about you and your dreams.
he told me it was a dream of yours that led police to the man who killed our nanny.
that once they brought him in, he confessed.
he told them that after you had brought Bryce back to me and Scott,
alberto and his partner realized they still had the alarm code.
they still had everything they needed to go through with the kidnapping.
they even had my husband's travel schedule, which is why last night, shortly after you assaulted me and took my son, they came to my house.
Oh, my God.
if you hadn't taken Bryce, it appears they would have.
they-they pulled up to our house and found police cars in our driveway.
police cars that were there because of you, Mrs. Dubois; because you'd taken my little boy.
now maybe it was just a coincidence, but I prefer to believe this...
this thing you have, this gift...
it forced you to keep Bryce safe.
and that's what I prefer to believe.
you're not going to prosecute me?
I told your boss that my memory of last night is faulty.
I'm not comfortable testifying about what happened.
Oh, thank you.
stay away from my house, Allison.
stay away from my family.
if-if I ever see you again, my memory may very well improve, do you understand?
I understand.
it's not going to be a problem.
I was there when Bryce needed me.
but I think for the rest of his life, one mother is plenty.
excuse me.
can you tell me the name of that song?
it doesn't have a name, actually.
I wrote it.
well, me and my dad anyway.
I'm Mr. Bronson, by the way.
and who are you?
nice to meet you, Bridgette Dubois.
Yeah, this song doesn't have a name-- 'cause it doesn't have an ending.
we never finished it.
I was working on it with my father when he, uh...
he passed away suddenly.
wait right here.
I think I know someone you're gonna want to meet.
cornell university office of admissions. Ariel Dubois.
I don't know, I mean.
thick is good, right? - no, thick is good. Thick is good.
you want to take a look?
what are you talking about? We can't take a look.
it's addressed to Ariel.
why not? Come on, no one will know.
you just steam open the envelope right here and then you reseal it.
no. Joe, come on.
cornell's her dream school.
ariel should be the one to find out first if she got in.
mom? Dad? Anybody home?
home, yes, yes, we're home. Here we are.
we're just waiting in the kitchen.
just growing older by the minute.
waiting for you...
Oh, I didn't know you were with somebody.
um, Mom, Dad, this is my friend Kyle Covington.
ms. Dubois.
nice to meet you, Kyle.
Mr. Dubois.
it's nice to meet you, Kyle.
you're just in time.
Ariel's just about to open a letter that she got from the admissions office at Cornell University.
or you could just leave it there and watch while your father has a heart attack.
your call.
um... you know what, it kind of doesn't matter.
what do you mean it doesn't matter?
it's Cornell. It's your dream school.
it doesn't matter because I'm pregnant.
bad dream.
the worst ever.
so this mystery kid Kyle-- did he seem nice?
was he nice?
Yeah, you're saying that he's going to be the father of my grandchild, and that's like, you know, it's like Christmases and Thanksgivings and birthdays.
and I just want to know if I was going to like the guy.
I can't believe you're joking about all this.
she's giving up her future-- everything she's worked for.
and you're asking me if the kid she's giving it up for is nice?
do you really think that this is one of those dreams?
I mean, even I've had dreams like that.
every parent with a daughter has dreams like that.
what are you looking for anyway?
the camcorder. I thought I had it in the case.
I want to tape Bridgette at the clarinet recital she's got.
I want to make sure it's charged.
I think I saw the girls playing with it the other day.
have you taken a look in there?
aha, here it is.
why didn't I know that?
okay, now one bar. See? I'm glad I looked.
what's this?
really!
did you tape this?
Yeah.
why, Bridge?
I don't know.
he's funny.
no, that is not right.
just because you think this man's funny, doesn't mean you can tape him without telling him.
he's our neighbor and you violated his privacy.
no, not really.
he doesn't even know about it.
no, just because he doesn't know about it doesn't mean it's not a violation.
what are we going to do about this, huh?
you're not going to make me apologize, are you?
because then he would know about it, and that would just make things worse, right?
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to delete this, and the second thing I'm going to do is I'm going to forbid you from using this camera again.
go to your room and finish getting ready for school.
you too, Tonto.
girls, come on.
five minutes and we're out of here.
so, um, I was wondering-- would it be okay if I came home after dinner tonight?
what's going on?
well, I have SAT prep this afternoon, and then I was going to go over to my friend Casey's house.
we have a chemistry test this Wednesday and we were going to study together.
I guess so.
but who's Casey? Do we know her?
no, you don't know her.
and don't get crazy, but...
Casey's not a her.
a boy?
well, when were you going to tell us this?
I don't know, I'm telling you now.
so, uh, is this a boy you study with, or...
I don't know. I mean, we like each other.
and then we hang out. We haven't gone on a date yet or anything.
so, is it okay?
well, I guess I'm just a little confused.
um, did, um, did Casey's mom invite you to dinner?
I mean, I don't know, he mentioned it.
so I don't know if his mother is, you know...
I'll tell you what, why don't you guys go do the SAT prep and then you and Casey come back here.
you-you want me to bring him here?
Yeah.
sure, why not? We got food, we got dinner.
you guys can study in the living room.
sounds good to me.
you think it over, okay, honey?
and talk about it with Casey.
but either way, I want you back here for dinner.
great.
the guy's name is Earl Sanderson. 55.
window was jimmied. A couple things missing.
it kind of looks like a robbery gone wrong, right?
I don't know. Why are you looking at me?
I'm not even sure why you want me here.
the guy's facedown in the fridge.
facedown.
what's he doing, offering the robber a beer?
or did the petty thief break in, realize that the guy was home and shoot in the back 'cause he relished the idea of turning his breaking and entering into a crime that would get him either life or the electric chair?
I don't know-- my Spidey sense is telling me that all is not what it appears to be, and I was hoping that my friend that sometimes sees things that aren't there might help to shed some light.
we got a partial sneaker print off the dirt outside the window, but other than that, I got nothing.
No! No, please! No, no, please!
please, please, please don't do this!
please don't do this to me!
someone help! Help!
help me! Help me!
help me! Someone, help!
please, please don't do this!
please, please...
why are you doing this to me?!
please, please don't do this!
no, no, no! No!
you know what, I don't think I'm going to be able to tell you who killed this man.
but I might be able to tell you about somebody this man killed.
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.
you got to come over and see this thing my buddy forwarded me.
this dude is freaking out.
come here. Come here.
look at this.
your friend found this on the Internet?
Yeah.
this guy's hilarious.
okay, who is this man?
do we know his name?
I don't know. He's just some guy.
some guy that lives around here.
some guy?
Bridgette, he's a person. He has feelings.
now you've exposed him to public ridicule.
last time I looked thousands of people had clicked on the video, and there are 60 or 70 comments, so...
after dinner, you and your dad are taking those videos down.
and then you're banned from the computer.
until when?!
until I say you're not.
mom, Dad?
be nice to your sister's friend.
in the kitchen.
um, Mom, Dad, this is my friend Casey.
Casey, this is my family.
there's another sister running around here somewhere.
I'm Kyle, Kyle Covington.
everyone calls me Casey.
Mrs. Dubois.
I know you dreamt that this kid got Ariel pregnant, and wrecked her future and everything, but...
But?
but I don't know, but he seemed kind of nice to me.
he did. He was polite and respectful.
and he seemed kind of smart.
and he acted like he genuinely cared for Ariel.
I mean, we can't lock her up until she's 25.
so forgive me if I take some comfort in the fact that she's found someone who's nice.
no, you're right, I take it back. Lucky us.
our daughter's going to be impregnated by a boy who's nice.
all's right with the world.
you don't know that.
Yeah, I do.
no, you don't know that.
first of all, you've told me yourself, your intuition about these things is notoriously unreliable when it comes to loved ones.
and second of all, if Ariel really-- if she was like-- irresponsible in that way, do you think that she'd allow herself to miss out on college?
come on, not Ariel. Not the Ariel I know.
not if she was pregnant with octuplets.
so how about we forget about the kid that we don't know, and consider the kid that we do.
cause I got to tell you, that this dream you had, it strikes me less as a cautionary tale about premarital sex, and more like the anxious fears of a mother who's a little bit nervous about the first boy who's ever come home for dinner.
sorry to call so late, but you know that composite you worked up this afternoon?
I had someone compare it to our missing persons database.
I think we may have found a match.
name's Angelo Filipelli.
small-time thief, bunch of petty crimes.
but, uh, I got to tell you, if Earl Sanderson really did bury this guy in concrete,
I highly doubt that's the reason he got shot last night.
why do you say that?
because Angelo Filipelli was reported missing in 1992, and no one's seen the guy since.
you're sure it was Casey?
Yeah, I'm positive.
he was carrying a gun and he was stalking that-that petty thief, that dead man that I saw yesterday-- Earl Sanderson.
I don't know.
that kid that we met yesterday, he doesn't seem like the kind to stalk anybody.
much less use a gun.
well, I'm telling you, it was him.
you didn't happen to notice what kind of shoes he was wearing, did you?
no. Why?
well, because the police found a sneaker print outside Sanderson's window.
well, don't worry about it.
I'll ask Casey myself when we question him today.
when you what?
when we question him.
a man was murdered, Joe, shot in cold blood.
Yeah, I know that. But this kid that we' talking about, this is, this is our daughter's friend.
and truthfully, the only reason that you think that he might be involved is 'cause you had a dream.
isn't that reason enough? - Of course it's reasonable enough.
I'm just asking you to consider the possible repercussions of what you're about to do here.
like what?
you're going to question this boy, he's going to go to Ariel, and she's going to be really upset with you.
so what would you have me do?
I don't know, wait!
wait for what?
more evidence.
so at least you're sure.
I am sure.
well, I'm not.
because this is our daughter's first boyfriend.
and don't you think that maybe, just maybe, this is about that?
you don't have to be Freud to suspect that there's something else going on here.
that may be you're finding reasons not to like this boy by inserting him into a case you're working on.
you really think that?
I don't know what I think. Just tread lightly, okay?
tread lightly.
well, I'm dropping off the girls and I'm meeting Lee at the high school.
to the high school?!
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to tell you.
I've never seen this man before.
did something happen to him?
someone, uh, shot him. He's dead.
you're sure you're okay talking to us? We'd be happy to wait for your parents or a lawyer.
Yeah, there's no reason to wait.
I don't know anything about any of this.
and, I mean, I know Mrs. Dubois.
I just really want to get back to class.
just give us a second, will you?
uh, okay, I get that you know this kid. I get that, uh, you had a dream, but, uh...
but what? Question him.
about what?
he's a good, clean-cut kid from the suburbs.
the dead man's a small-time, lowlife punk.
absent your dream, this makes no sense.
just... question him.
all right.
so, Casey... I need you to tell me where you were two nights ago, say between 10: 00 at night, 2:00 in the morning.
at home.
doing homework and then sleeping.
look, am I in some kind of trouble?
can anybody confirm that?
that, uh, you were home, I mean.
I don't know.
my dad's out of town on business, and my mom went out to dinner with friends that night.
I went to sleep before she got home.
I suppose if you ask her what time she got home and if she checked to see if I was asleep.
but other than that...
uh, you mind if I ask what size shoe you wear?
ten.
what does that matter?
the police found a shoe print outside Earl Sanderson's-- the man who was shot.
it was the same brand and the same size that you're wearing.
wait a second. Everyone has these.
look, Mrs. Dubois, you'd tell me if I was in some kind of trouble, right?
you'd help me?
mom.
Casey, wait outside.
mom, this is...
I know who they are. Just pick up your things and wait outside.
Mrs. Covington, my name is Allison Dubois. My daughter and your son are friends.
I know who you are. I know who both of you are.
the principal called me.
why are you questioning my son? What's this about?
we received a tip about a young man matching your son's description at the scene of a homicide two nights ago.
this is a joke. My son?
Mrs. Covington, no one's accusing your son of anything.
we're just trying to ascertain if he knew this man.
you come marching into a public school, question a 17-year-old without notifying his parents, without giving him the chance to consult an attorney?
honestly, we offered to let him call you.
excuse me, Detective Whoever You Are, this is still America, isn't it?
this boy is an honor student. This boy is a national scholar.
and you ambush him at school to talk to him about a homicide?
like some kind of thug?
what is the name of your supervisor?
you can just call the chief of police, ma'am.
I think I will.
and I think I'll call my attorney, too.
and if you still have any questions for me or my son, you should just feel free to run them by him first.
Oh, and I'd appreciate it if, in the future, you, your daughter, your entire family stay away from my son.
just stay away.
well, that was productive.
Lee, he's hiding something.
didn't you see the look on his face when you asked him about his shoes?
also it's not like it's a particularly expensive or unique shoes.
and size ten is like saying I'm a righty.
he was there, Lee, I saw him.
Hey, wait, Lee, wait.
she's still out there.
Lee, look.
what am I looking at?
no, nothing. I'm sorry.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Mr. Dubois?
my name is Lloyd Darby.
you recognize me?
I'm betting that you do.
a lot of people recognize me these days.
I take it you're aware that a young lady who lives in this house has been filming me, putting the videos on the Internet?
Yeah, that's my daughter.
uh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Darby.
um, I can assure you, the video is down, it's gone.
my wife and I just found out about this last night.
and if there's anything that we can do, if there's any way that we can make this up to you...
you know how many people have watched that video?
my second cousin in Maine sent me the link.
people point at me in the supermarket.
they laugh at me when I'm in my car.
does your daughter have some reason to dislike me?
no, no, no, no. Absolutely not.
I mean, I know I'm not the most graceful man in the world.
I know I'm carrying a few extra pounds.
but I don't think I deserve to be reminded of that every time I leave my house.
no absolutely not.
I need you to understand, if I ever find myself on the Internet again, if your daughter ever violates my privacy, I'll have no choice but to sue you.
I've already been in touch with a lawyer.
please don't give me a reason to have to contact him again.
it just keeps going right to voice mail.
Hey, Ashton Kutcher, tomorrow's garbage day.
cans are already out front.
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
Ariel's still not home. It's after 8: 30.
no, no, no, no. Don't do that.
she's fine, really. She's just mad, like you said she would be.
it's my fault. I-I dealt with this whole thing so stupidly.
I should have spoken with her, let her know what was going on.
be that as it may, she's still not home, it's a school night. I'm worried.
ariel is home. She's outside in a car with her boyfriend.
go away.
I only came home because I knew that Daddy would be worried.
Bridgette and Marie would be worried.
okay. The thing is, I...
I wanted to tell you, I did something wrong.
you sure did.
no, I mean honey, I should have spoken with you first, let you know what was going on - that I had this dream, that I had to question your friend...
no, see, you didn't have to do that.
okay, you could have come to me and asked me if he was capable of being involved with something like that, of knowing anyone like that.
I saw him following that man that died.
I saw him carrying a gun.
you didn't see it.
okay, you dreamt it, and you're wrong.
you don't know him, I do.
well, that's another thing. I don't want you seeing him anymore. - What?!
he had a gun, Ariel!
in your dream!
okay, which isn't real!
and you can't make me not see him.
don't test me.
no, no, no! Where are you going with that?!
you can have this back as soon as you agree to take my calls.
Sheridan's Pharmacy is becoming Calloway Drugs.
why didn't you come home night?
your father and I have been worried sick.
he went looking for you at school.
look at me.
you promised me you wouldn't come here anymore.
they knew I was lying.
Ariel's mom, that detective.
they could tell I knew the man in the picture.
but you weren't lying.
you don't know that man; you only think you do.
don't tell me what I know.
that man, Earl Sanderson, he kidnapped me, he threw me in a hole, he covered me in concrete.
right here.
right here 17 years ago.
Casey, listen to me.
this thing you keep telling yourself, it's not real.
you're not Angelo Filipelli.
I know you don't believe me.
but I died, Mom.
I died here 17 years ago.
I died the day I was born.
what is that?
it's Angelo Filipelli. It's you.
those are X rays generated by ground radar.
I convinced the police to use them outside the old Sheridan's Pharmacy in Glendale.
I was certain we would find nothing.
and then there it was.
a skeleton.
someone is buried in there.
what difference does it make?
why do you care?
well... I think that you did something really horrible, something you may have to pay for for the rest of your life, and I want to help you.
you really think I killed that guy, don't you?
I've always known... as long as I can remember, my name is not Kyle Covington.
it's Angelo Filipelli.
and I don't know why. Okay? It just is.
I know all about his life.
I can do the things he could do.
when I was five, I could fix a car. Okay? I just could.
check it out.
Angelo Filipelli was a mechanic.
I know about how he died, too.
he was killed...
I was killed by a tall guy with a limp and a ponytail.
this doesn't surprise me at all.
I go there all the time.
I just stare at it.
one time, I'm there, and... this man shows up.
I knew who he was.
he was still wearing that stupid ponytail.
I followed him back to his apartment.
you know, I kept wondering if there was something I was supposed to do.
kill him, maybe?
but I'm no killer. Okay?
and Angelo Filipelli, he's no killer.
look, I'm telling you the truth.
Mrs. Dubois, you have to believe me.
does she know about all this?
no.
look, if it's okay, we have a class together, and I just don't want her to get in any more trouble.
no, it's okay.
tell her I said so.
What'd she want?
you know what she wanted.
they think I killed that guy.
I hate this. Okay? I'm not a murderer.
I didn't shoot anybody, okay? I couldn't have.
I don't have a gun. I-I've never even seen a gun.
I know.
look, maybe your parents were right.
maybe we should leave each other alone for a while.
Casey... Casey, I'm not my mother. Okay?
I know you... and I know that you could never hurt anybody.
thanks for believing in me.
we should get going. Class started a few minutes ago.
you coming?
Yeah, that's me. Can I help you?
you've been served.
No! No!
you defied us?
I wasn't going to, but then I had this dream, and everything that happened in the video pretty much happened in the dream first.
except that in the dream, I saw myself taping everything, even though you told me not to.
and in the dream, after the hornets chased the guy away, he came back and thanked me for putting it all on tape and for getting it on the Internet.
wow, really?
now, you expect us to believe that?
it's the truth!
no, it's not the truth, Bridgette, because the man that you taped, Mr. Darby, is so upset with it that he's suing us for defamation of character.
is that bad?
it could end up costing us a lot of time and a lot of money, darling.
well, the one bright spot in all this, if there is a bright spot, is that you only taped him in public places.
so technically, his privacy wasn't violated, I think.
so we may not be in any trouble?
no, no, no, no, this is gonna cost us something before this is all over.
none of it changes the fact that we told you not to do something, and you did it anyway.
mom?
I-I need to talk to you.
she's doing better?
not really.
I... got her to stop crying for a little while, at least.
then she'd go over it again, and she'd get sad that somebody she cared about lied to her.
maybe even killed a man.
no. I'm still hoping not.
I got an e-mail back from the lawyer.
it's like I thought-- he says the guy really has no case.
well, that's good.
Yeah, but it still doesn't get us out of having to go to court, and it still doesn't get us out of paying the lawyers' work.
so he suggested that we should offer a settlement.
we're gonna meet with Darby's lawyers tomorrow and see if we can work something out.
how much "working out" are we talking here?
he suggested we offer $5, 000 and then go up to $7, 500 if we have to.
doesn't this guy know we just bought a new car?
Hey, Lee. What's going on?
based on your tip, we were able to get a warrant to search the Covington's resident.
found the 38 revolver right where you said it'd be.
ballistics says it's a match for the weapon that killed Earl Sanderson.
and, uh. We've just filed charges.
thought you'd like to know.
Thanks, Lee.
they just found the gun.
Casey's gun.
it was the one that was used to kill Sanderson.
should we tell Ariel?
no. She's been through so much.
we'll tell her in the morning.
you look good, Nance.
you look good, too.
sit down.
the guy you're with must be taking good care of you.
you have to stop calling me.
says who?
angelo, that girl you're trying to charm... she doesn't live here anymore.
I haven't touched drugs for two years.
this is the last time we're gonna see each other.
maybe, maybe not.
that baby you're carrying around...we both know that it' not your husband's.
you can't expect me to just disappear.
that night was a mistake.
one mistake.
and I am not gonna make another one.
I got a nice life for myself. I got a nice life for my baby.
nice things. Nice people.
and I am not going to mess that up.
look, you're not going to come out of this empty-handed.
I can pay you some money, but there is no way you are going to be a part of my son's life.
it's a boy?
lunch is on me.
don't call again.
what are you going to name him?
it's Michael's father's name.
he won't take the money.
he won't go away.
you need to take care of it, Earl.
you're waiting to see your son?
how dare you sit next to me, pretending to give a damn about me or my son.
you're the reason he's in jail.
now, kindly leave me in peace.
okay, well... Casey won't be back there long.
at this point, we're pretty certain that he didn't do it.
are you serious?
we know who the guilty party is.
we're just waiting to see if we can get her to confess.
you know, it seems that 17 years ago, the killer hired a man named Earl Sanderson to murder a man named Angelo Filipelli.
Angelo Filipelli was her child's father, but she didn't want her husband to find out.
I have no idea who you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
I spent the whole morning going through bank records.
yours. Earl Sanderson's.
Hey, you want to hear a funny coincidence?
starting in 1992, around the time Angelo Filipelli went missing, Earl Sanderson started living off of cash from a mysterious benefactor.
the amounts of his deposits and the amounts your withdrawals match up pretty nicely.
another funny thing?
the size of Sanderson's deposits got bigger and bigger year after year.
so did the size of your withdrawals.
till one day, Sanderson turns up dead and you stop making withdrawals.
so, what?
was he asking for more money than you could hide from your husband?
how does this work? They know I'm here. Are they going to call my name?
Casey told the police that the gun used was a family weapon, although when we questioned your husband, he claimed he didn't know anything about it.
it was your gun, wasn't it?
what? You find this amusing?
I find it strange.
you're making all kinds of accusations.
we're in a police station, but no one is arresting me.
you know what I find strange?
you love your son.
you were even willing to murder someone to make sure that he had a better life.
now you're willing to let him go to jail for a crime he didn't commit?
let me tell you something about my son.
Casey is a very disturbed boy.
ever since he was a child, he's believed he's someone other than who he is.
I can't tell you how many doctors he's seen. How much testing, consulting...
perhaps now, the court will see to it that he gets the treatment he needs.
you are really putting a lot of faith in an insanity defense.
you seem to be suggesting that I have some choice in this matter, that there are options here.
there are no options here.
think about it.
aren't there?
Oh, I think there are.
right now, your son is back there getting a simple DNA test, and I think we both know that that test is going to show that Casey is not your husband's son.
I don't want to do this to Casey.
I don't want to do this to your husband.
but I will do it if I have to.
and then what? What?
everything that you've worked for-- everything that you've killed for-- it all goes away.
along with your family.
along with anyone who loves you.
or. I will make sure that that DNA is disposed of, that it is never tested.
least, in this way, Casey will still have a father.
still have a family.
he will still have a future.
and... if I were to confess?
maybe offer, um... a different motive?
well, I will keep your secret.
I promise.
Mr. Dubo - Yeah. Mr. Darby.
uh, my attorney, actually, he isn't here yet, so...
I just, I'd just like to say again how sorry I am about all this and how-how terrible my whole family feels.
it's all right, Mr. Dubois. - No. No. No, it's not.
Yes. Yes it is.
in fact, um, maybe you should call your attorney.
I actually don't think we're going to be needing attorneys.
uh, excuse me?
it's the funniest thing.
uh, Anna and I worked together at a water park in Minnesota the summer after college.
lost touch. Years go by I always thought about her.
turns out, she always thought about me.
then she saw your daughter's video.
okay. Great.
well, who'd have thought it?
I know.
Oh, my lawyer thinks I'm crazy.
he told me I should have taken your money.
squeezed you for a little more, even.
but I don't know, Mr. Dubois. I mean, we are neighbors, and today just doesn't feel like a day for attorneys.
how is she?
she's... amazing.
she wants to see him again.
I told her it was okay.
but he lied to her.
I know. She knows.
he took his mother's gun. He followed that man.
he stood outside his window in his canvas high-tops, but at the end of the day, he couldn't do it. He didn't harm him.
she just keep saying how confused he is, how sad.
his mother's in prison.
that he can't make sense of it all.
how he knows the things he knows, how he knew where Angelo Filipelli was buried.
but here's what I know.
I know he's a good kid.
and the rest of it, I can't explain.
so you really can see me?
they told me you could.
the way I heard it, kids can only see people like me for a year, maybe a year and a half.
we got a lot to pack into that time.
but you have to be patient with me.
cause I'm new at this.
being a dad.
being dead.
I'm gonna come see you every night, okay?
every nigh till you can't see me anymore.
that's gonna be our special time.
I'm gonna tell you all about my life.
the good... and the bad.
all of it.
I'm gonna try and teach you stuff, too.
but first things first. We got to talk about this name of yours.
your mom and that guy she's with...
I know they named you something different.
but when I'm around, I'm gonna call you the name I would have given you.
it's my granddad's name.
my da's name.
your dad's name.
I'm gonna call you Angelo.
Yeah.
they change the street-cleaning days, and no one tells you it's on Tuesday now.
I got a $65 ticket.
Yeah, I probably should fight it, but I mean, come on, who has time to take a half day off and go to traffic court?
all right, well, I got to take a shower, so...
we're still on for tonight, though, right?
okay.
Yep, I will see you then.
Bye.
Well...looks like it's your lucky day, Jinx.
I am all out of dry food.
Hello? - Naomi?
uh, no, I'm sorry, this is Gretchen.
I'm sorry.
is Naomi there?
uh, no, there's no one named Naomi here, so, um, I think you have the wrong number.
Really?
no, she has to be.
she waited on me the other night, and we kind of hit it off.
this is the number she gave me.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to be the one to break it to you, but I think maybe this Naomi, whoever she is, she might not want to actually talk to you, so... sorry.
Bye.
all right, Jinx, chow time.
hop to it.
lazy dog.
Hello? - Okay, here's the thing.
I know Naomi's there, so stop playing around and let me talk to her.
wow, you've really got a problem.
now, listen to me, okay?
there is no Naomi here, there are no waitresses that live here, and there is no one here that wants to talk to you.
Yes, there is...
up and at 'em.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God...
Hello? - Tell that bitch Naomi to come to the phone.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Stop calling me, okay?
I can't deal with you right now.
I have an emergency.
a dead dog is not an emergency.
who is this?
okay... I'm gonna go get your... your pen, a-and I'm taking you to the vet.
when you're finished, bring your plates to the sink.
it's almost 8: 00. We got to get a move on.
dad? - Yeah?
wh-why are you dressed like that? I mean, aren't you going to work today?
uh, yes, I am.
I'm meeting my boss for lunch, and he's kind of a laid-back, casual kind of guy, so...
so you decided to dress sloppy?
does, uh, does Mom know you're dressed that way?
mom is not here. Mom went to work early.
and besides, she's your mom, she's not mine.
I decide what is appropriate for me to wear to work.
well, it, um, it just seems strange.
Yes, it is strange.
this guy never has lunch with anyone, and suddenly he shoots me an e-mail saying he wants to eat with me today.
I know where he likes to go. It's just this little hole in the wall, so...
maybe I'm overthinking it.
y-you're the one who's always telling us to "be yourself."
well, come on, this is me. This is just more of a-a weekend kind of me.
you know what? I'm gonna change.
Naomi Clark has been missing for five days now.
isn't it safe to assume she's already been murdered?
absolutely not. Miss Clarke is still classified as a missing person.
but the three other victims were all dead within five days of being abducted.
that's true, that has been the pattern thus far, but that doesn't mean it's a foregone conclusion.
Naomi Clarke's family is holding out hope that she's still alive, and so am I.
other than that, I don't have much new to report.
the mayor is doubling the size of the task force, uh, devoted to finding the killer, and we are aggressively pursuing each and every lead as it comes in.
so what do you make of his name,"The Penny Jar Killer"?
you know,'cause he leaves the body of his last victim inside the home of his next victim?
take a penny, leave a penny.
cute, right?
the man slaughters innocent women. There's nothing cute about him.
now, if you'll excuse me.
Yeah, that's her, Naomi Clarke.
the killer left her body in what I can only guess is the next victim's house.
she was hanging in the closet. She was bound by electrical tape.
she was still wearing her waitress uniform. It had a name tag that said "Naomi."
and you got a good look at this next victim?
I know her first name's Gretchen.
Oh, uh, and in the... in the dream, she-she'd gotten a parking ticket.
for parking on the wrong side of the street for street-cleaning.
it was Tuesday.
today's a Tuesday.
traffic ticket-- I might be able to do something with that.
traffic police use handheld computers to give out tickets now.
they go right on to the system.
I'll get someone to monitor it.
soon as we hear that a car registered to a woman named Gretchen gets a ticket, we should be able to find out where she lives.
I appreciate this.
no, listen, got to eat lunch.
I just, uh, you didn't mention in your e-mail why you wanted to get together, so I, uh, I just...
I didn't quite know if I was supposed to prepare something...
it's not about your performance review or anything like that.
I mean, I'm very aware that that's tomorrow.
so you can put your mind at ease. It has nothing to do with that.
in fact, I'd go as far as to say that you have nothing to worry about in that regard.
hi there.
Oh, that's okay, I'll just have what I always have.
Oh, I'll just have what he's having.
sure you want to do that?
sure. Sure I'm sure.
I'll tell you why I e-mailed you.
the truth is... I need a favor.
Oh, sure, Keith, no problem.
what can I do for you?
well, when I think of you, as opposed to anybody else I work with, any of the other engineers, I think of you as someone who is very... regular.
regular? - Yeah.
regular, you know? Like, not strange. Pretty normal, right?
y-you're married, you have a family, you have some kids.
Yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm pretty regular.
good.
because I'd like to share something with you that I haven't shared with anybody else I work with.
okay.
there you go.
what's this? - That is my novel. It's on that drive.
I want you to read it, and I want you to be brutally honest with me.
your novel? - Yeah.
I started writing it when...
when did the first Lord of the Ringsmovie come out?
here's your chocolate milk.
and here's your chocolate milk.
your entrees will be right out.
great.
great.
great.
thank you.
okay, turns out there was a girl named Gretchen, and she did get a parking ticket.
Gretchen Morgan got a parking ticket at 11: 25 this morning.
I'm on my way over to her place now. You want come in my car, or you want to follow?
wait a second, you're telling me that that man, The Penny Jar Killer, you think he's after me?
well, again, we're responding to an anonymous tip.
um, it may turn out to be nothing once we take a look around.
excuse me for one second.
what about your dog?
excuse me?
you have a dog, don't you?
Jinxy, wake up.
baby.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Lee. Lee.
you see that kid over there, he's got black work gloves?
got the same kind of tape that I saw covering Naomi's mouth.
sir, police. You mind if I ask you a couple of questions?
name's Jeremy Kiernan.
couple of priors for drug possession; one conviction for harassment.
harassment?
legalese for "stalking.
22-year-old girl-- 30 days plus probation.
so you think this is him? You think this is The Penny Jar Killer?
well, it's sure starting to look that way.
electrician's assistant lived about a mile away from Gretchen's house.
his job took him close to the homes of the other victims.
we may have a match.
I got people scouring his apartment and his car.
he's got to be hiding the body of that other girl, the, uh, the waitress somewhere.
I'm gonna go call Manny, give him an update.
but, uh, thanks for the "anonymous tip."
I wasn't running because of that.
I'm sorry?
I wasn't running because I killed someone.
I would never kill anybody.
I heard what that guy said.
a long time ago, there was a girl.
I liked her more than she liked me.
you want to call that stalking.
but following someone, calling them on the phone too much, that's not murder.
okay. So why did you run then?
I had a joint in my pocket.
would've been my third strike.
you would've run, too.
okay, then explain the gloves. Explain the electrical tape.
I'm an electrician.
okay, well, I believe that, but the rest of this...
So...What can I do to convince you?
sorry. I startle you?
I just don't get it. Why wouldn't he admit it?
tell me where the girl's body is? What's the point in denying everything?
he's dead.
well, he just got hit by a car.
that can have a way of clouding your thinking.
Plus, he's a murder.
I mean, I haven't actually read the rule book, but my guess is that the number one rule at Serial Killer Club is that if somebody asks you if you are one, say no.
actually, I wish I was reading the Serial Killer Club rule book.
it's that bad?
I'm, I mean, I'm just a hundred pages in, but, I mean, maybe it'll pick up, but...
this thing sucks like a Hoover.
I should be grateful. At least he gave it to me the day before my performance review.
I mean, he can't expect me to read this thing in one night.
it's over 900 pages.
hello. - Hey, it's Lee.
sorry to bug you at home, but, uh, I got some bad news.
when we left Gretchen Morgan's place today, she was pretty shaken up.
she had a friend come spend the night with her.
he went out to grab some takeout, and when he came back, she was gone.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
and when we opened up the closet, we found Naomi Clarke.
looks like we were wrong, Allison.
unless this guy got up off that morgue slab and strung this girl up by her wrists.
Jeremy Kiernan was not the Penny Jar Killer.
it's not my fault. I didn't make a peep.
it's your brain; I can hear it whirring.
I can't help it, it is whirring.
I just feel terrible.
that man is dead.
he'd be alive if I hadn't pointed him out to the police.
okay.
maybe.
we can't be sure.
can't we?
no. You're not God.
at least not last time I looked.
I don't even want to think about what that would make me.
okay, not funny.
you're joking and I feel like I've got this man's blood on my hands.
you don't. You didn't put that joint in his pocket.
you didn't make him run.
maybe not.
still, some job I did today.
imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night.
it's only right To think about the girl you love, and hold her tight.
so happy together.
if I should call you up, invest a dime
and you say you belong to me and ease my mind.
imagine how the world could be, so very fine
so happy together
I can't see me loving nobody but you For all my life
when you're with me, baby
the skies will be blue for all my life
me and you and you and me
no matter how they tossed the dice, it had to be i love you Mandy Sutton.
the only one for me is you and you for me.
so happy together.
me and you...
she's amazing, isn't she?
I hate being dead.
Jeremy... what are you doing here?
well, seeing as how I'm not a serial killer, and now you know I'm not a serial killer, and seeing as how you and your friends kind of, you know, killed me today, and seeing as how you're the only one who can see me,
I was hoping we could talk about something.
not here.
you want me to talk to your girlfriend?
I need her to know that... I love her.
and I need her to know about you.
about me?
I need her to know that even though it feels like I'm gone, I'm still here.
I can still help her.
cause I can see her and you can see me, so I can still be there for her.
I can help her do the things she needs to do.
wait a second. Let's just take me out of this for a second.
I don't think those kinds of things... can be said.
those are the kinds of things that need to be felt.
and the truth is, once her pain subsides, she will feel them.
so you won't do it?
I don't think it's smart. No.
I mean, and the truth is, once your pain subsides, you're not gonna want to hang around here.
you're gonna want to move on to wherever it is that you're supposed to go.
you don't get it.
our love is different.
our love is forever.
I know that you believe that.
I'm not saying that's not true.
and you got to know that I feel horrible about everything that has happened to you.
but I just can't do it.
I just, I can't do something that I know is gonna cause a lot of heartache down the line.
I just can't do it.
so what about that Penny Jar guy?
what? What about him?
I can see everything from here.
I'm pretty sure, if I put my mind to it, I could find out who he is for you.
and I'd be willing to do that.
I'd be willing to help you.
but I need you to be willing to help me.
Oh, uh, hey, Brian, can you give us a couple of minutes?
Absolutely.
so? - So?
What'd you think?
the book?
uh, well, I mean, I'm only about a hundred and so pages into it, so...
okay. So you were able to put it down?
well, I'm not saying it was easy. No.
but, you know, like you said yesterday, I'm kind of a regular guy, so, you know, I got kids to put to bed, I got a wife I got to spend some time with.
Yeah, no, no. Of course, of course.
so what'd you think?
from what I've read?
you really want that?
wouldn't you rather wait till I finish the whole thing before I give you an opinion?
uh, no. I mean, is there some rule that says you can't give me an opinion now and then another opinion when you're finished?
no. No, I s-suppose not.
so...
so, uh...Yeah, so...I think it's-it's interesting.
that's it? Just interesting?
no, it's not just interesting.
I think you made some brave choices.
thank you.
look, I-I know that this is really awkward for you, but I want you to be honest with me.
I am, I am. I'm being honest.
no, I know you're being honest.
if I forced you, if I, if I made you say something negative...
you want something negative?
there's-there's got to be something. Right?
you know, you put it down, so...I know this is hard. I just...
well, it is hard. You know, I'm not, I'm not having a negative experience, uh, so far.
so I don't know if I'm comfortable being negative.
you're not being negative.
you know, I'm-I'm asking you to be constructive. Right?
can you give me, uh, a word?
like, one word. An-an adjective, a negative adjective.
can-can you do that?
I don't know.
Yeah, you can. Just-just think.
I don't know. I don't know.
uh, maybe... diffuse?
diffuse?
what the hell does that mean?
diffuse, uh, well, let me see-- diffuse-- it means kind, like, all over the place.
I know what it means.
well, you know, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
diffuse.
again, I'm only a hundred pages in.
so you know, I think I need time to...
well, I want to see how the whole thing comes together, you know.
that's why I really didn't want to say anything yet.
diffuse.
okay, well, I got her favorite band.
got her favorite flowers.
and got a fistful of articles about myself.
Yeah, and if all that fails, just rember-- tell her to look in the hatbox in the closet.
hatbox?
right.
can I help you?
Mandy, hi. My name is Allison Dubois.
I'm a friend of... I was a friend of Jeremy's.
I just want to tell you how sorry I am.
okay. Thank you.
I'm sorry, he never mentioned you.
Oh, no, he wouldn't have. We didn't actually meet till yesterday.
I work for the District Attorney's office.
and I was investigating the Penny Jar Killer.
God, you were there.
did you see it happen?
I was, and I did.
he wanted me to give you these. He said they're your favorite flower.
he said that?
after the car hit him.
I didn't realize. I guess I wanted to believe it happened quickly-- that he didn't suffer.
Oh, no, he didn't.
it happened quickly.
um, he-he also wanted me to give you these.
sorry, what are these?
some-- some articles about me, about how I-- how sometimes I see the dead.
how I can communicate with the dead.
okay, this is unspeakably cruel.
he thought that you might react like that.
that's why he said those are your favorite flowers, this is your favorite band...
right.
look, I have a funeral to prepare.
people to call, arrangements to make.
so I'm going to go back in the house now, shut the door and ask you to leave my property.
he wants you to know that he's watching you, and that he loves you and if there's anything you ever need to say to him, you can say it through me.
look, I hear you, but just so you know, if I have anything to say to him,
I'm going to say it to him in my own way and my own time, thank you very much.
Oh, wait, wait.
the hatbox, he wants you to look in the hatbox in the closet.
he wants you to look in there...
al, what do you think?
Yeah, I think it, um, looks good. I think it's fine.
well, it's my performance review, so I was kind of hoping for better than fine.
you're gonna do great.
look, he's told you already that you don't have anything to worry about.
Yeah, that was before I let him down by not reading his entire 900-page opus in one night and declaring it a work of genius.
one thing has nothing to do with the other.
take it from someone who knows nothing has anything to do with anything.
come on, Al.
what did you expect?
the man just died.
the woman just lost her boyfriend.
I know, I know, I know. It's just-- he said "You do this and I'll do that.
so I did this.
he just disappeared, and I haven't seen him or heard from him since.
Hello?
where am I?
anybody here?
can you help me?
I don't feel well, and I don't know where I am.
please.
hey... hey wake up.
Oh, good, you're awake. We need to talk.
Jeremy, I didn't think I was going to see you again.
did you do that on purpose?
did I just do what on purpose?
I was having a dream, and in it I was just about to see the face of the Penny Jar Killer.
but right before it happened, you woke me up.
Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
but, look, I don't think it matters.
I mean, that's what I'm here for.
I found out who the guy is.
so he really does exist.
Shane Malinowski? He sure does.
soon as I punched his name into the system, the printer went into overdrive.
look at this guy's record.
he's the poster child for social deviants. Like an accident waiting to happen.
and you're confident this is the man we're looking for?
the late Jeremy Kiernan is confident.
he's the one who gave me his name.
and he is in a place to know.
he also told me that Malinowski spent his mornings in Humboldt Park.
that's where he scouted for his victims.
sounds like we should put an APB out on this guy.
get some men over to Humboldt Park, take a look around for him.
how did you know?
know what?
it was in the hatbox.
he must have been planning to propose.
how does it work? Is he here, now?
please.
no, no, I'm sorry, he's not.
I'm sorry for the way that I treated you yesterday.
I mean, that's really what I came here to say.
I was hoping he'd be here.
hoping you could tell him about some decisions I've made.
I can do that.
I've decided to leave Phoenix.
it's just-- it's too hard.
I mean, I came here because of Jeremy.
and I see him everywhere. I feel him everywhere.
it's wrong to be here without him.
so I have some loose ends to tie up, house and all.
but as soon as I can, I'm going to head back east and try living with my mom for a while.
I'm sure that Jeremy would understand that.
Yeah.
when you see him-- tell him "thank you."
and tell him, thanks to you, I know what I have to do now.
tell him that I would have said "yes'.
I'm sure he knows that.
but I will let him know.
come on in.
nothing to be afraid of.
just your run-of-the-mill performance review.
I'm sure you've been through these before.
it's kind of nice, your supervisor being here.
taking a personal interest in your career.
here we go.
I have to say, Joe, we, uh, we were all very excited when you came on board here.
although, according to this, you've been having some trouble adjusting.
uh, trouble adjusting?
well, I'm sorry to say, the evaluations I received from your supervisor, reflect, well, a certain level of disappointment with your performance.
as you can see, pretty much straight down the line, there are issues with the clarity and focus.
excuse me?
well, let's read along here, shall we?
describe your coworker's communication skills.
and what does it say there?
diffuse.
describe your coworker's ability to problem solve.
diffuse.
describe your...
well, you get the idea.
Yeah, yeah. I sure do.
remember that ring?
I took it off the first girl we ever did together.
you loved it so much.
kept asking what happened to it.
I lied.
said it probably fell off her finger when I was fighting to get her in the van.
I've been saving it for just the right moment.
guess I waited too long.
that lady who came by today?
she's the real deal.
that's what I need you to know.
that's what I need you to understand.
you got to clean up our mess and get out of town.
Attagirl.
you got work to do.
is it done?
can I go now, please?
I know you haven't had all your fun yet.
let's be smart, huh?
you know what I'm talking about.
you know what you have to do.
please let me go.
No!
you know what you're doing.
don't waste your time.
you're just going to embarrass yourself.
you can't prove anything.
Oh, by the way, Malinowski?
the guy I told you murdered all those girls?
he died.
froze to death in the desert two nights ago.
you might want to mention that to the people you work for.
you used me.
Oh, I did what I had to do.
how can you do that? How can you just sit there, so smug, so calm?
we're going to get your girlfriend.
we are not going to let her leave town.
sure you will.
what can you do?
that basement? It's clean now.
there's no trace of anything that happened down there. No evidence whatsoever.
Oh, yeah. She'll leave town.
and sure, you'll keep an eye on her for a while.
call whatever jurisdiction she ends up in.
tell them to keep an eye on her.
but time goes by.
there'll be other crimes.
other murders here in Phoenix.
and you'll forget.
that's how these things go.
she'll be fine.
as long as she doesn't slip up.
as long as she's patient.
so what? She just stops?
well... I didn't say forever.
I mean, when you do the things that we do, it's a tough itch to scratch once you've got it.
but, like I said, Mandy, she's nothing if not patient, so...
she'll wait.
wait for the right time.
the right situation.
a signal from me, maybe.
and I'll be patient, too.
wait for her.
ain't love grand?
Hi, Allison.
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you.
but Jeremy came to see me last night.
he said he had one last message.
well, what did he want you to tell me?
well, it didn't really make a lot of sense to me at the time.
I mean, with you getting ready to leave and all.
but he was terribly concerned about you going through all of this by yourself.
I mean, getting ready for the funeral, and-and moving back east.
he was-He was worried that you didn't have a friend to help you through all this.
Jeremy had you take this?
this morning.
he said that he thought the two of you could make great friends.
that she was perfect for you.
I wonder what he was thinking.
he said to tell you that-that she jogs every morning at Walker Park at 7: 00, 7:00 in the morning.
um, oh, and he wanted you to know that if you two do become friends, that he will be watching, that he'll see everything, and that it'll bring him a lot of pleasure to know that you're not alone.
Hey, Keith. Can you not hear me over there?
am I being too diffuse?
what are you working on? Is that company business or more of your Lord of the Harry Potter crap?
all right. This is a private office. You can't-You can't just walk.
you owe me an apology.
and I want you to write a letter to human resources saying you didn't mean any of the things that you wrote in that report.
Oh, but I meant every word of it.
of course, it's fairly early on in your employment here.
I might modify my opinion in time.
just like you might modify your opinion when you finish my manuscript.
when I finish your manuscript?
after what you did to me?
no. Are you out of your mind?
no. I'm not indulging your childish behavior for one more second.
that's what this is about, isn't it? That-That I'm much younger than you.
Hey, you're not that much younger than me.
no. I'm-I'm a lot younger than you.
well, you're certainly a lot more childish than I am.
and I think that your behavior in that meeting yesterday, and in fact, your behavior from the second you gave me that screed of yours...Screed?
punk.
okay. All right.
you're calling me a punk, then?
Yeah, punk, I am.
cause that is what you did yesterday. That was a punk move.
that was not something that an adult would do. That is not something that a man would do.
so now I'm not a man?
I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?
cause I was busy trying to remember what decade it was that I last had a chocolate milk for lunch.
all right. That's it, Dubois.
you want a piece of me?
careful what you wish for, punk.
come on. We'll settle this old school.
like men? - Yeah, like real men.
I got that!
shoot him!
take that, punk.
die, old man!
are you guys ever gonna finish?
we've been waiting here an hour.
didn't your parents teach you to respect your elders?
go away.
scat.
this is serious.
come on.
you all think that you're winning here today?
you think that you're punishing me?
you don't know the way things really work.
I am going to go see Jeremy today.
and that is a reward.
and we're gonna laugh.
at all of you.
at all of this.
it's done.
you tried to abduct an undercover cop.
Oh, my God!
it's really you!
Yeah. It's really me.
I've been waiting so long to see you.
well, actually, no, you haven't.
I mean, really, Mandy.
I thought we could have stretched this thing out a little bit.
I didn't think it was going to end quite so fast.
are you disappointed?
well, yeah.
a little bit.
I mean, you did try to abduct an undercover cop.
when did you get so stupid?
seriously, what happened?
did you become a total idiot after I died?
that woman, she said she had a message from you.
Yeah, she lied.
it was a trick.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a trick.
I'm sorry, okay?
I wanted to believe it.
I wanted to believe that you would be watching one last time.
Jeremy, why are you mad?
we're together now and we'll stay together. Forever.
yeah? And what are we gonna do forever, Mandy?
we're gonna stare at each other? Talk?
I thought you liked talking to me.
I thought we were perfect together.
there was one thing that made us perfect for each other.
and now, thanks to you, that one thing is gone.
thanks to me?
I didn't get hit by a car because I never learned to leave my dope at home.
couldn't leave it at home,'cause, as you and I both know, it wouldn't be there when I get back.
one time! One time I smoked without you.
get over it! - Get over yourself.
you think I don't know you also go through my wallet?
check my email, look through my cell phone?
that's 'cause you go through mine.
I do not! - You do, too.
do not. - You lie!
who you calling a liar?
you, liar!
yeah? At least I'm not an idiot.
Oh, shut your face!
at least I don't have -
Oh, sorry.
Oh, no. It's okay.
I was awake already.
Oh, yeah? Why is that?
bad dream?
there's one time in particular that I can't get out of my head.
I took our housekeeper's matches and I set the leaves in the backyard on fire.
then I tried to blame her.
you knew better, of course.
and you used it as an opportunity to teach me the difference between lying and being a liar.
I learned that day that I could say anything to you, and that whatever we had to deal with, your love for me would never go away.
I guess that's why I'm writing this to you.
I know you and Mom are worried about me.
I know you think I'm not handling college well, that I'm adrift.
and I guess you're both right.
but it's a little more complicated than that.
you need anything?
your mom wasn't sure that you would have enough money left after buying your books.
no, I'm fine, Dad.
I'm so glad you came all the way out to see me.
I know you're busy.
and I wanted to talk to you, really talk to you, but I just couldn't.
that's my fault, Dad, not yours.
so I'm going to say everything now.
I know that's not fair.
but please don't be too mad at me.
this is something I've been thinking about doing for a while now.
and I want you to know that it would have happened no matter what.
I've been so confused.
and this thing, it's...like a lighthouse in the middle of all that.
it's so easy to steer toward, that I feel like it's where I have to go.
the first thing I want to say is that I'm sorry.
I hope that, since this is the last time I'm going to talk to you, I can give you what you need to come to terms with what I've done.
you're my dear Dad.
I can say anything to you, right, Dad?
Hello?
departure time is T-minus five minutes.
if you're not on the train, you're going to be left at the station.
can you help? Thanks. - Yeah.
Marie, honey, you got five minutes.
I just want to finish this chapter.
well, you can finish in the car.
Hey, is this a library book?
Where'd you get this? We haven't been to the library in ages.
it was in my closet.
when was it due?
I don't know. I didn't take it out.
well, who did?
who do you think?
well, somebody must have cleaned the room and just stuck it in the closet.
somebody?
bridge, that isn't your book.
it belongs to the library.
Yeah, well, I guess I forgot they were in there.
they? How many have you got in there?
I don't know. I mean, they let you check out seven at a time.
Bridgette, you have seven overdue books in your closet?
you're not supposed to take the library books, you're supposed to bring them back.
well, it's too late now.
I mean, if I brought them back, then they would send me to jail or something.
they're not going to send you to jail.
they're going to charge you a fine.
I'm guessing it's going to be big.
my hunch is your allowance is going straight to the public library for the next few months.
but library books are supposed to be free.
they are free, as long as you play by the rules.
after school today, I want you to walk over there and return those books.
fine.
I was reading that!
well, too bad.
go check it out at the library.
hello.
morning.
sorry to bother you so early.
Oh, no, no, no. It's no bother, Mr. District Attorney.
I was wondering if I could ask a favor.
wondering if there was any way I could get you to drop by my house on your way to work this morning, say around 9: 00?
of Course. Is everything all right?
nothing that can't hold until 9: 00.
nice hair. - Nice glasses.
as you both know, our daughter Arianna took her own life during her sophomore year of college.
today is the anniversary of the day she died, the day I found her.
losing a child...is always a nightmare for any parent.
for us, I think it's been especially difficult.
Arianna didn't leave a note.
she never told us why.
nothing at all?
she never communicated with either one of you?
Lily went out to get the newspaper, and saw that the flag was up on the mailbox.
and when she looked inside, she found this.
happy ANNIVERSARY
Oh, no.
this is terrible.
I'm so sorry.
I certainly made my share of enemies over the years.
put plenty of bad people in prison, even received death threats, but never anything like this.
never anything involving my family.
would you please excuse me?
you know, this is going to sound crazy.
I think I saw the man who did this.
what are you talking about?
I saw a man putting something in your mailbox.
I mean, I didn't really see it, and he wasn't really there, but I didn't realize that at the time.
I actually got a pretty good look at him.
he was young, maybe 30.
Caucasian, tall, thin.
and he was wearing these glasses.
kind of... black, vintage frames.
ring any bells?
no, I don't think so.
okay, I'll tell you what-- I'm going to canvass the neighborhood, see if anyone else saw this guy.
I'm also going to have someone at the station put together a file of all your cases.
a mug-book of everyone you've tried.
if the guy who left this really is someone you put away, then, well, hopefully, Allison will recognize him.
young lady, these books are very late.
you've had them for more than a year now.
I know.
I, uh, guess I just kind of lost track of them.
I'm sorry.
but they were really good.
glad you thought so.
now maybe some other children can enjoy them, too.
I'm afraid we've already forwarded these to collections.
you owe the retail cost of the books.
which comes out to $92. 18.
ninety-two dollars?!
I'm just a kid! Where am I supposed to get $92?
uh, you're not going to call the police, are you?
am I going to get arrested?
what about asking your parents?
no. I don't want to do that.
they're already really mad at me.
I might have an idea.
you're working at the library?
why are you so surprised?
I don't know.
it just seems odd that someone would depend on you to do anything.
Hey, I'm dependable.
and besides, they've got books laying around all over the place in there.
so this is good.
I'm helping them with their problem, and instead of paying me, they're paying off the fines.
it sounds like a pretty good solution to me.
honey, don't eat any ice cream before dinner.
well, when are we going to eat?
I'm hungry.
I don't know. That's a good question. Where's your mom?
she's been in her room for the past couple hours.
Hey, you hungry?
should I order some pizzas?
no, no; we have some leftovers in the fridge
I was going to heat up.
I'm sorry, I got so caught up with these files.
still no luck?
I've looked through every single person that Devalos ever put away, and none of them look like the man I saw leave that awful card.
well, maybe it's time to pack it in for the night.
I guess so.
I just wish I could do something. I wish I could help.
well, wait a second.
aren't you actually that psychic woman who, uh, gave the police a description of the guy who did this?
very funny.
you know what I can't figure out?
the Pythagorean theorem?
last night, I had a dream about Devalos and his daughter.
and in it, I saw him find a suicide note.
I even heard what the note said.
I mean, most of it, anyway.
but then when I went to his house this morning, his wife said that Arianna never left anything behind.
now, why would he do that?
why would he keep something like that from her?
I have no idea.
Hey, you want to take the kids out?
I know it's a school night, but, you know, it might be fun to take the kids out.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, no attorney relishes the prospect of taking on a case that involves the sexual assault of a young woman.
it forces us to ask uncomfortable questions about the personal behavior of both the alleged assailant and the alleged victim.
in this case, we will have to look closely at what happened on the night that Deanna Whalen, by her own admission, willingly accompanied the defendant back to his home.
that they had sex not once, not twice, but three times over the course of the evening is not in dispute.
and yet, Miss Whalen maintains that a crime has been committed.
that she gave him her phone number the next day is also not in dispute.
but still, she claims that she was not a willing participant in the previous evening's events.
miss Whalen even concedes that it took her three days before deciding to call the police.
and now she cites her inability to recall the precise events of the evening as proof that Mr. Gerwin must have drugged her and raped her.
quite a story.
but that's all it is.
a story.
and the district attorney knows it.
now, the prosecution will attempt to portray the defendant as a man of low character, but he is not.
they will paint my argument as an attack on Miss Whalen, but it is not.
truth be told, my client is guilty of nothing more than participating in consensual sex, and the irony is, his accuser is guilty of the same.
and yet, she seeks to use this court and you, this jury, as a kind of legal absolution, as a way to wash away her sins so she needn't take responsibility for them.
there's only one problem with that.
william Gerwin is not a rapist.
william Gerwin is an innocent man.
Yep. That's definitely him.
that's definitely William Gerwin.
back when I worked as a defense attorney at McClenahan-Everett,
Mr.Gerwin was one of my clients.
a rather important one, actually.
he was the son of one of the partners.
he was 22 when he was accused of drugging and raping a young woman that he met at a party.
her name was Deanna Whalen.
Gerwin's father personally asked me to take his son's case as a favor.
and...
I was only too happy to oblige.
the case was very weak.
a classic "he-said, she-said."
rape kit was never administered.
no drugs were found in the girl's system.
she didn't even file a report with the police until several days after the alleged incident.
the ADA who was handling Gerwin's prosecution knew the odds were against him, and he offered me a deal early on, but I-I turned it down.
that's how confident I was in the case.
I remember that case.
that kid wound up going to jail, didn't he?
someone sent a collection of videos to the District Attorney's office in the middle of the trial.
never found out who sent them, but it didn't much matter.
they were videos that William had made of himself having sex with unconscious and obviously drugged women, including Deanna Whalen.
the deal I'd been offered evaporated.
william was given the maximum sentence, and I left McClenahan-Everett shortly after that.
I-I'm sorry, sir.
if he received a maximum sentence, then how could he be the one to leave you that card?
turns out, he was recently granted an early parole.
it seems that one of his cell mates took him into his confidence one night, told him the details of an unsolved murder, something to do with organized crime.
it was a federal case, so Gerwin went to the local FBI office.
and in exchange for his sealed testimony, time was shaved off his sentence.
as I understand it, Gerwin never even had to appear in open court.
the man Gerwin sent to jail never even knew who offered him up.
and you're absolutely certain that William Gerwin is the man you saw put this card in the box?
it was him, sir.
I'm sure of it.
I already reached out to his parole officer.
we're bringing Gerwin in for questioning in a few hours.
if he really was the one who left that note in your mailbox, well, let's just say
I intend to make damn sure he doesn't leave another.
whoa. Cool.
miss Aiken, who's that guy?
Oh, nobody special.
just a fellow who comes in every day to use the computers.
"Prince"?
no, I've never seen this card before.
I certainly didn't leave it for Mr. Devalos.
so, is that it? Can I go now?
not just yet, Mr.Gerwin.
okay.
so what else do you want to talk about?
how is the "Man-Man" doing, anyway?
that's what my dad used to call him.
Manny didn't like it very much, but what can you do, right?
well, you seem to be having a pretty good time.
what would you say if I told you that we had an anonymous tip from someone who says that they saw you put that card in Devalos's mailbox?
well, the first thing I'd say is, "Your tipster is mistaken."
but even if he or she weren't, what's with the hard-ass routine?
I mean, whoever left this card, did they do something illegal?
is there a law against mailing people greeting cards?
there are laws against harassment.
and does this card break that law?
Mr.Gerwin, you're on parole, right?
if we want to, we can make life very difficult for you.
so why don't you just admit what you did, and we can get this thing cleared up today?
because I didn't do it.
I've never been to his house.
I haven't thought about him in years.
you sure about that?
the "Man-Man" was your lawyer.
you got convicted.
you're not holding a grudge?
why would I hold a grudge?
I raped that girl.
I went to jail.
why would I be mad at my attorney?
rich kid like you probably had a pretty rough go of it in prison.
I wouldn't be surprised if you got a little taste of your own medicine, once or twice.
once or twice?
I spent years getting "a taste of my own medicine.
that what you wanted to hear?
that there's a ying for every yang?
now, if this card upset your boss,
I don't know what to tell you.
but me?
the new me?
I'm a firm believer that if you get a card like this, you probably deserved it.
so maybe you should be sitting your boss down, asking him why he thinks he got this.
he was so smug.
he was practically rubbing our noses in the fact that he did it.
to work out his anger at your boss.
but he's on parole, right?
he's essentially impotent.
if he does anything, he goes right back to jail.
so he-he sends that card.
he gets a rise out of a bunch of people.
it's kind of like a child, don't you think?
like a child?
he raped a teenage girl, and when he couldn't get away with it, he blamed his lawyer.
there's nothing childlike about that.
uh, Dad? Can you come look at the computer?
stay. Stew. Finish your beer.
finish my beer, if you like.
I mean, look at this. Suddenly, I have 200 e-mails that I didn't have this morning.
I mean, I don't want to earn six figures selling real estate in my spare time.
I don't care about getting $5,000 from "cash for clunkers without even turning in my car.
and I don't want to hear from this "Prince Abantu" again about how he can't get at his $20 million inheritance.
did you guys say something about Prince Abantu?
did you download the latest version of Spam Blocker?
no. You told me not to download anything, so I didn't.
okay. Scoot over.
let me drive for a minute.
did someone say something about Prince Abantu?
Yeah. Why?
I think I know him.
you don't know him. He's not real.
I mean, he's a scammer who claims to be a Nigerian prince who needs help recovering frozen assets from some trust.
I mean, it's like, you give him $10, 000, and he gives you a million.
no. You're wrong. Prince Abantu's a real guy.
he goes to the library where I work.
you can come visit him, if you want.
I mean, he's there all the time.
and I wouldn't delete that if I were you.
all we have to do is just send him some money, and then we can move into a bigger house.
he doesn't look like a scammer to me.
he looks like a prince. I mean, he wears robes, and he carries this big stick thing and...
I don't know who you saw, sweetie, but I got to side with Ariel on this one.
this is one of the oldest tricks in the book.
I've gotten 100 e-mails like this.
people who send them aren't connected to African royalty in any way, shape, or form; they're just criminals.
okay, but I think you're wrong.
okay.
they were on a shelf in the bedroom; hidden in plain sight.
obviously, the cops never bothered to actually look at the tapes when they searched his place.
my people didn't, either, the first time through.
it's a good thing you sent me to take a second look.
look inside.
is this what I think it is?
take a look.
here, have some of this. Have a little drink.
um, I don't...
no?
uh, no. - No?
I don't feel so good.
no?
no. No?
no, I don't feel so good.
no?
the others are just as bad.
different girls, same drill.
I know it's not what you were hoping I'd find, but at least now you know.
you'll be ready if there are other copies floating around for the prosecution to latch onto.
you want me to accidentally drop these in an incinerator?
no, that's, uh, that's not necessary.
I'll take care of them. Thank you, Walter.
I'm telling you Manuel Devalos torpedoed his own case.
manuel Devalos, the most honest, ethical man I've ever met.
not the second-most honest and ethical man you've ever met?
Oh, come on, Joe.
why would he do that?
I don't know. Maybe, maybe 'cause he knew the guy he was representing was guilty?
maybe he was sick of representing rich scum.
or maybe he just wanted to give lawyers everywhere a good name.
no, I'm sorry.
none of that explains it.
if he couldn't represent his client in good conscience, then he should have just resigned from the case.
what he did was a violation of attorney-client privilege.
hell, what he did was illegal.
but don't you kind of admire him for it?
a bad man, a dangerous man, who might otherwise have walked free, went to jail.
sorry. I'm on Team Devalos.
Yeah, well, if the truth be told, so am I.
but why am I dreaming this?
what am I supposed to do with it?
I've been waiting for one this easy for a long time.
you do nothing.
and you admire your boss just a little bit more.
I know I do.
and you definitely don't say anything to anybody about this.
that's what you do.
thanks for coming by.
everything okay?
honestly, I'm not sure.
this is a weird one.
a girl named Jennifer Ludlow rents this place.
she's a bartender.
community college student.
slept at her boyfriend's place last night.
gets home early this morning, finds the door like that.
someone forced their way into her place.
but she's all right?
Oh, yeah, she's fine; there was no one here.
there's nothing missing, either.
so what are we doing here?
someone put one of these in every picture frame in the place.
okay, I'll ask. What is this?
can't say for sure. Seems like someone's trying to send Manny a message.
I know what you're thinking: our friend William Gerwin.
the problem is the scene's clean.
so far, we haven't found any physical evidence at all.
none of the neighbors saw anything.
we got bupkis.
does Devalos know about this?
he didn't want to come down. Just said, "Thanks for telling me."
seemed kind of distracted.
anyway, feel free to look around.
and holler if you get a bite.
of course.
you've reached the voicemail of Manuel Devalos.
please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Take this.
sir, can you give me a call when you get this?
I'm just leaving that woman Jennifer Ludlow's apartment.
unfortunately, I didn't see anything that could be of any help, but I do need to talk to you about your old client.
we meet again.
you did this.
sorry? Did what?
don't play coy.
we both know what you're doing and why you're doing it.
Really?
you know why?
well, if that's the case, if you really know what went on with me and my legal representation, then I'm sure you share my sense of outrage.
see, I think I deserve what every other accused citizen deserves:
a fair trial.
and that means having a defense attorney who's not serving me up on a silver platter to the prosecution.
what do you want?
how is harassing this man gonna change anything?
are you aware that after I was convicted, my family disowned me?
it's true.
so not only did I spend all those years in prison,
I came out with nothing.
I'm a convicted felon. And I'm penniless.
that man-- your boss
he destroyed me.
so what do I want?
I guess I'd like to destroy him.
I want him to come forward and admit what he did.
I want him to lose his job.
and I want him to go to jail.
well, that's crazy.
that's never gonna happen.
Oh, I think it might.
you know, I was really hoping that Manny was gonna come down here this morning.
but you seem pretty close to him.
maybe you could give him a message for me.
there's a reason why all those articles wound up in Jennifer Ludlow's apartment.
she's young, pretty.
just my type.
I don't understand.
sometime soon, if the District Attorney doesn't come forward and admit what he did,
I'm gonna rape Jennifer Ludlow.
you should say something.
you really are insane.
you know, the act of just making that threat is a violation of your parole?
you're going back to jail.
I don't think so.
are you wearing a tape recorder?
cause if anyone asks if I made the threat,
I'll deny it.
you'll never get near that that girl.
we will have people protecting her.
we'll have people following you.
Yeah, okay, but how close can they get?
can they follow me everywhere?
if someone were following me right now, do you really think they could stop me from, say, uh, breaking your neck?
if I didn't care about getting caught, that is, and...
I don't.
look, I get it.
you and the people you work with, you're gonna do what you're gonna do.
you'll be watching pretty little Jenny and you'll be watching pretty little me.
so maybe it'll be her.
maybe it'll be someone else.
the important thing is is that Devalos knows about all this ahead of time.
that way, if he doesn't step up, the girl I find...
she won't just be my victim, she'll be his victim, too.
pretty good, right?
that'll kill him, won't it?
good man like Devalos.
respected man.
no way he'll be able to live with himself if he let's that happen.
I know who you are, you know.
pardon me?
I know you're a prince.
I know about the problem.
I know about the money, and I want to help you.
I've got a little more than $38 saved up.
but I know it's not much, but it's what I've got.
and when you get all that money that you've been writing to people about, you can pay me back. I just want enough to cover my library debt:
$92. 18.
I think you are mistaken, little girl.
you've got me mixed up with somebody.
you don't have to pretend with me.
I know you're a prince, okay?
I've read the e-mails.
and I know that you have enemies everywhere, but I'm not one of them.
and look, even if you don't get all your money back,
I want you to have this.
I'm sorry, young lady, but you've got me mixed up.
I must get going.
no, you can't just not take my money because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.
okay, okay, fine.
okay, give it to me.
isn't it a little early?
no, what it is, is... a little cowardly.
what it is, is selfish.
your timing is impeccable.
I was a minute from making a clean getaway.
your assistant told me where I could find you.
sir...
we really need to talk.
so all I have to do to prevent this lunatic from keeping his promise is step forward and declare myself a criminal?
he knows what you did, sir.
I don't know how he knows, but he knows.
and I know it, too.
look, I would never second-guess what you did.
I might have done the same thing.
and I know how much you stand to lose.
but unless there's something I'm not seeing,
I don't think you can keep this a secret much longer.
I think you need to start telling people what you did.
and not to give in to him...
but to keep him from doing something that you would never recover from.
I mean...
if he hurt some girl...
I don't think you could live with that.
there's a lot you're not seeing, Allison.
but I appreciate your concern.
uh, sir?
sir, I'm a part of this, too, now.
I don't want to be, but I am.
if you don't come forward...
I don't know, I might have to.
well, I guess we're each gonna do what we have to do.
I can say anything to you, right, Dad?
well, this is the last thing you need to know, the thing you're never gonna get to help me deal with.This thing that's been living inside me, this cloud that I can't get out from under, it's always been there, but it started to get worse during my senior year of high school.
kim and I went to this party.
it was mostly college kids home for their Christmas break.
there was a boy there.
his name was William.
he was a little older, cute,funny.
I liked him, so I pretended to be older.
he kept giving me drinks.
I started to feel funny, so he asked me if I needed to lie down.
he helped me upstairs. And the rest?
well, you're defending him now; you know what he does.
I was barely awake for any of it.
all I knew the next day was that something sick had happened to me.
when I read about your case in the papers, when I realized how many other girls he'd done it to, how maybe I could have stopped it all if I had been braver and said something, well, that's when all this started.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I should have said something to you.
sir.
I've...
I'm so sorry.
I had a dream last night, and in it...
I saw ev-everything.
now I know why you did what you did.
I'm so sorry if I was short with you yesterday, so sorry about what happened to Arianna...to you and Lily.
for everything.
thank you.
it's been quite a burden.
the hardest part has been keeping my wife in the dark.
unfortunately, it looks like that's...
no longer an option.
you are gonna come forward?
I don't think I really have a choice.
I should have put it all together sooner.
the obituaries that he was leaving everywhere...
that's how he figured it all out
he must have come across one in prison and when he saw her picture, imagine his surprise when he realized that he raped the daughter of his own defense attorney.
I'm gonna call a press conference tomorrow, late afternoon, admit what I did.
Lily's away on a trip with some friends.
I want to speak with her first.
after that, I'll speak with the press.
hopefully, the fact that there's going to be a press conference will be enough to keep Mr. Gerwin at bay for a day.
I'm gonna miss this place.
excuse me.
this is for you.
you already have my, uh, $92. 18?
no, it's just what you gave me yesterday.
I can't keep it.
I don't care what you say.
you know, uh, I've only been doing this for a couple of weeks.
I'm not proud of it.
it's just, uh, I haven't worked in a while, and I was hoping to get a little bit of money coming in.
but the truth is, your $38 was all I got, and, uh, I didn't set out to swindle little girls.
so you're not a prince?
why are you dressed like that?
when you're done with those, would you come help me in the children's section, please?
Yeah, sure.
um, Miss Aiken, this is Prince Abantu.
he's from Nigeria.
nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
well, at least one of the Dubois women is happy in her work.
Bridgette loves working at the library.
she doesn't even mind the fact that you can't really talk in there.
will hate to see it end.
meets all kinds of interesting people.
even helped a nice young girl set up an e-mail account.
come on, Bridgette Dubois, Librarian at Large?
isn't that good for at least a smile?
well, I guess not.
Hey, come on, I mean...
I just, I can't stand the thought of this monster getting away with this, the thought of Devalos losing his job, his license.
I know he made a mistake, but the truth is, if that had been one of our daughters,
I would've done the same thing.
I think he showed remarkable restraint in not murdering the son of a bitch.
see? It's easy.
now you can write e-mails to whoever you want.
Wow. Thanks.
you're a very smart kid.
Yeah, well, I get that a lot.
actually, can you help me with one more thing?
I'm not a very good typist.
I always feel like I have ten thumbs.
is there any way you could type up an e-mail for me?
don't be upset with me.
Arianna, what are you talking about?
what are you doing here?
that e-mail I had your little girl type...
it went to a crime boss named Tom Harper.
william Gerwin got his parole by agreeing to testify in an organized crime case.
he sent away one of Tom Harper's top lieutenants.
harper never knew who the snitch was.
that is, until now.
Oh, my God, you do know what that man is gonna do to Gerwin, don't you?
Absolutely.
and by the way, he's already done it.
Gerwin is already dead?
it happened about an hour ago.
that man took everything from me.
there's no way I could let him take everything from my dad, too.
I want what he did to remain a secret.
well, I'm sure it will.
now... maybe...
maybe there's no reason for anyone to know now.
good.
but there is one person who deserves to know the truth...
who needs to know the truth.
will you do something for me?
get my father to do something for me?
I love you, Dad.
and I love you, Mom.
you both gave me so much love, "and I'm taking that with me wherever I'm going.
now you'll need to give it to each other.
goodbye, Daddy.
goodbye, Mommy.
I love you. Arianna.
but deliver us from evil."For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever."Amen.
you done?
what was that?
I think it was Marie.
what is it, sweetie? What's wrong?
daddy, Daddy, there was a man out there.
what? - What?
it's okay.
did you know him?
not really. I'd see him around from time to time.
I'd wave at him or his wife.
Oh, my God, his wife, his kids.
they're fine.
everyone except MR. Mulhearn here was in Chandler with one of the grandparents.
wife's on her way back now.
this is the third home invasion murder in the past month.
the first two happened in the Western Precinct so, uh, their homicide squad's handling the investigation, but this matches the M. O.Exactly.
someone pried open the back door, forced your neighbor here to open the family safe, and then put a bullet in the back of his head.
I know. I dreamt it last night.
th-the last part of it anyway.
but you mean you didn't come all the way out here to say hi?
so, uh... give me a description of the shooter.
I can do one better than that.
I can give you an eyewitness.
Hey, Mommy, what happened?
what's with all the cop cars outside in the middle of the night?
our neighbors, the Mulhearns-- somebody broke into their house.
are they okay?
well, it could have been worse. Only MR. Mulhearn was home.
Sweetie-- honey, the police are going to want to talk to you tomorrow about that man that you saw.
is he going to come back? - No, honey.
the people that I work with, they're going to catch him.
they're going to put him in jail.
okay, but can I please sleep with you guys tonight?
of course you can.
wait a second. Well, then who's going to sleep with me?
remember how when we first moved in here,
I'll call tomorrow.
I'm interested in Southfork because it combines the advantages of a small school with the benefits of a large public university.
the ratio of teachers to students is low, which is something I'm definitely looking for.
okay. What do you think?
does it sound weird talking about ratios?
maybe I should just say, like,"Class sizes" Or something.
I don't think it matters. I mean, you already rocked your SATs.
you really think this interview is that important?
it's for Southfork.
I mean, they're sending someone all the way down here to do it.
world themes is calling.
you ever read Beowulf?
Yeah, me either, and I'm about to have a test on it.
later. - Good luck.
Southfork, huh?
that's a good school.
tough to get into, though.
that's what I hear.
did you know that less than ten percent of the people who applied there last year got in?
those are brutal odds.
excuse me, do you work here?
are you a-a teacher or something?- No.
okay, so then what are you doing here?
why are you hanging around a high school library?
people are trying to study.
Oh, don't worry, nobody can hear us.
honest. Honest!
you're... - Yeah, as a doornail.
almost three months now. Heart attack.
tenth mile of a training run.
my name is Alan Hahn, Dr. Alan Hahn.
I was a... A professor of romantic literature at Southfork.
tenured professor.
head of the department actually.
okay. Well, then it's, um, it's really nice to meet you, I guess.
well, it's nice to meet you, too.
Ariel... I think I can help you get into Southfork.
in fact, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll get into Southfork.
Really?
how can you be so sure?
well, when I was alive, I was married to a woman named Sondra Hahn-Barker.
sound familiar?
she's interviewing me tomorrow.
Yes, Sondra is a very successful attorney. She's one of Southfork's must active alumni.
she's on the board of directors.
she's raised god knows how much money for that place If you get her stamp of approval, you are in - it's as simple as that.
and I can tell you exactly how to do it.
if you listen to me, you will give the interview of Sondra's life, 'cause I know just what she wants to hear.
okay, but... Why would you do that for me?
a very good and canny question.
it is, after all, a rather large favor.
in return for which, I'm asking only a small one.
at the interview, Sondra will have a laptop. It was mine.
there's a file on there I'd rather she not see.
when an opportunity presents itself-- and I know that one will
all you have to do is just delete the file.
how do you know that she'll leave me alone with that computer?
Oh, the same way I know that you're going to pass this interview with flying colors.
Yes, it's one of the few perks of my current condition.
what else do you need to know?
what's on this file that you want me to delete?
uh, it's personal.
it's, uh, no big deal. It's just-- it's embarrassing.
honestly, there's just some, uh, material I'd rather, you know, my wife not know about.
I think you-you understand what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I got the idea.
hello. Your security system is ready for activation.
cool. It talks.
sure does. The 2100 will even react to the sound of your voice, if your hands are full and you can't punch in your code.
okay, um...
your security system is armed.
once it's armed, and the sensor's been tripped, you have 20 seconds to turn it off before the alarm goes off.
automated VOICE: Your security system is disarmed.
what else does it say?
excuse me? - The alarm.
what else does it say?
uh, pretty much just " Armed" And "Disarmed.
I can set it up to tell you which alarm sensor's been tripped if you want.
can it say our name?
not quite there yet. Maybe next year's model.
all right, well, the alarm is set. Don't open a window unless you want the police here.
good to know.
you've been, uh, in there for 45 minutes.
what have you been doing?
I was making the Mulhearns lasagna.
I'm going to drop it off in the morning.
Oh, that poor woman.
I think her name is Amy.
I can't even imagine what she's dealing with right now.
losing her husband suddenly like that?
mommy?
I can't get tired. I'm still too scared.
you know we've got an alarm now, sweetie, right?
it's on and everything.
I know.
you want to sleep with us again tonight? Hmm?
all right. Come on, you little one.
your security system is armed. Your security system is disarmed.
your security system is armed.
you heard me. I said you're safe.
you could talk? - I sure can, Marie.
my name's Sal, and I'm here to protect you.
and I hope that you and I are going to be very good friends.
Allison, right?
um, I hope I'm not intruding.
thank you.
everyone's been so kind.
I can't tell you how much we appreciate it.
um, would you like to come inside? Another neighbor brought a deli tray by. I-I made coffee.
well, I would love to. I'm, I'm just a little late for work.
um, another time?
okay. - I've actually got to get going, too, Amy.
okay. Um... Allison, have you ever met Josh Berryman?
he lives right around the corner.
hate that we're meeting 'cause of this, but, uh, it's always nice to meet your neighbors.
take care, Amy.
Bye.
Berryman worked as a software consultant until his company went under;
that was about two years ago. Wife filed for divorce ten months ago.
does he have an alibi for the night of the Mulhearn murder?
Nope. Doesn't have one for the nights of the other two murders, either.
way Berryman tells it, he spends most nights watching TV at home by his lonesome.
still and all, I know this guy's broke, but, uh...
he just doesn't strike me as the home-invading, execution-style-murdering type.
it's him. He did it. He's the man I saw.
well, there's one way to find out for sure.
you ready?
okay, Marie, you see all those men in the room there?
let me tell you a secret.
you can see them, but they can't see you.
okay?
so all you have to do is point out the man that you saw running through your backyard, and the police here will take care of the rest.
all right? - All right.
good. So, do you see him?
no.
are you sure, sweetie? Maybe you want to take another look?
no, I don't think I remember.
Marie, sweetie, that man can't see you. You have nothing to be afraid of.
no, I don't remember his face, Mommy. I'm sorry.
but, honey, you looked right at him.
al. She said she doesn't see him.
...she really saw the guy? - Well, she did her best.
can we do that again tomorrow?
look, I know Marie saw that man's face. I just need a little more time to talk to her.
you mean nobody else has come forward to say they saw him?
no. And so far, forensics has nothing to tie him to the scene.
so, without your daughter's I. D.we got nothing on this guy.
you can't just let him go.
Allison, no one is questioning what you saw.
but there is simply not enough evidence to justify holding him.
he's a killer, sir.
he lives down the street from my family.
from my daughters!
all right. By law, I can hold him for 24 hours without charging him.
but if we don't find enough evidence between now and then...
you have to let him go; I understand.
those dorms, oh, my goodness.
which one is it - the one that was built in 1842?
well, that's Whitman Hall.
that's where I lived as a freshman.
you did? You're kidding.
no. Sorry.
Oh, it's my office; I'm going to have to take this.
I thought I'd be done by now.
I didn't expect to find someone so engaging.
do you want me to wait outside?
no, no. I'm gonna run to the ladies' room after. This'll just take a sec.
Hello, this is Sondra.
that's your cue, kiddo.
you got about 90 seconds.
are you sure this is the right file you want me to delete?
stop looking at it and just do it.
but I don't get it. Why do you want to delete a bunch of baby photos?
happy now?
just do it.
you were involved with this person.
and you lied to me.
you know what?
I already nailed that interview.
so I don't need to erase any of this for you.
fine. If you think my wife's life, or anyone's life, is gonna be made better by looking at those pictures, go ahead, just leave them.
but you've got eight seconds to decide.
all right, Ariel, ready to dive back in?
Absolutely.
you did very well in there today. I think you're a lock.
I just wanted to, you know, check in, make sure you're not thinking about doing anything rash.
you mean you want to know if I'm gonna tell your wife that you were involved with another woman and had a baby with her?
that's a bit presumptuous, isn't it, Ariel?
y-you don't know that that's my baby.
are you saying it isn't?
I'm saying, the paternity of that child has never been established. Not to my satisfaction.
not to your satisfaction?
is he your child, or isn't he?
I don't know how to answer that, Ariel.
that is a mystery which is now, sadly, lost to the sands of time.
you know, the woman, uh, you saw in those pictures-- I wasn't the only person she was dating at the time.
uh, Abby was a student of mine.
a very, uh, uh, popular student.
okay, but in those photos, she obviously thought that it was your child.
you-you know what? I'm not getting into this with you.
uh, have a wonderful life. Enjoy Southfork, hmm?
uh, and here comes my wonderful widow Sondra.
what's wrong, Marie?
there's no reason to be scared.
I told you I'd keep you safe.
I can't help it.
I understand.
it's a dangerous world out there.
that's why I'm here - to keep you safe.
to warn you about the bad guys, and to scare them away if they come too close.
and do you know why you're here?
to help me.
and that means you have to listen to what I say.
you have to do what I ask you to do.
because I'm the one in charge of keeping everyone safe.
you understand that... right, Marie?
that's easy to understand, isn't it?
you listen to me, and everything is fine.
you don't listen to me, and your whole family dies in their beds.
how's that sound?
Marie? What are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
who were you talking to?
no one.
are you sure?
come here.
honey, if anyone ever threatened you, if anyone ever told you things to scare you about our family, you would tell me, right?
you know Mommy works with the police.
I would get them to put that person in jail.
and even if it wasn't a person, you would still tell me, right?
because you know, I would never let anyone or anything hurt you.
you know that, right?
Oh, honey... Were you talking to that alarm?
was the alarm talking to you? You can tell me.
it talks when you turn it on.
well, I-I know that, but other than that.
mommy, burglar alarms don't talk.
not really.
I'm gonna go back to bed now, okay?
okay, so the burglar alarm... is evil?
no, Joe, that's not what I'm saying.
not exactly.
okay. What are you saying exactly?
I'm saying that in my dreams, this thing is talking to our daughter, and I don't like what it's saying.
and I know how that sounds, but I've seen it.
I come in tonight. Marie is standing in front of the alarm.
and it's dark.
but I'm pretty certain that she was talking to it.
al, I'm having a hard time following you down the rabbit hole on this one.
I know this thing seems pretty high-tech because it talks, but it's act...
it's actually fairly simple.
in terms of programming power, it's about as sophisticated as the toaster oven.
smart people have been experimenting with artificial intelligence for decades now, but I doubt that anybody has cracked the problem, snuck it into a burglar alarm without telling anyone.
okay. Then why don't you explain why I'm seeing this?
the burden of proof is on me here?
Yeah. - Okay, fine.
if I had to guess, I would say that you are dreaming about what Marie is seeing in her imagination.
kids sometimes respond to trauma by creating imaginary friends.
Marie has been through a trauma, and if she's getting comfort by giving the burglar alarm a personality, by imagining it can keep us all safe, why is that such a big deal?
it's not comforting her, it's threatening her!
it's telling her that we're all gonna die.
and you know what? I don't care if you can't explain it.
I don't like it!
I'm gonna call the company tomorrow, and I'm gonna have them take it out.
well, hold on a second, Al.
we just spent $2, 200 on this thing.
I'm not saying we won't have an alarm. I just want a different model; One that doesn't talk.
your security system is armed.
who asked you?
Allison, what can I do for you?
did I just see Josh Berryman in here?
you sure did.
we released him this morning, so I asked him to come by so I could personally apologize for any inconvenience or embarrassment...
apologize? - You didn't see the paper this morning, did you?
there was another home invasion last night in El Mirage.
they cleaned out the safe and shot a retired couple in the back of the head.
since MR. Berryman was in our custody last night, it seems unlikely that he was involved.
that, plus the utter paucity of any evidence against him, well, there's really no basis on which to hold him.
but I saw him do it.
that's all well and good.
no, no, no, you're not hearing me.
obviously, it wasn't him last night.
I don't know if he committed these other murders, but I know he killed my neighbor.
I saw him do it.
I can even tell you exactly where the murder weapon is.
what are you doing?
I thought we had a deal.
Yeah, I thought I was supposed to help you get rid of some porn.
yeah-- is this about the baby? Are you still upset about the baby?
the paternity of that child has never been established.
all I know is that that information was on your computer when you died.
okay, so maybe your wife was supposed to find it. I'm not sure.
I'm just sure that I was never supposed to remove it.
you think that's going to make a difference? That kid is nothing to Sondra.
my family's obligation to that boy died when I did.
Yeah, well, that's not up to me to decide.
and you don't know.
maybe she'll want to help.
y-you're talking about my wife?
that woman sues people for a living.
she would personally kill the last baby seal on the planet if she thought there was a dollar in it for her.
that, that kid is nothing to Sondra.
she'll do nothing for that kid.
maybe she will, maybe she won't.
it's not up to me.
you might as well stop talking because there is nothing that you can do to stop me.
Oh, I know that.
I'm not trying to stop you. I'm just trying to, uh, delay you.
Mrs. Hahn-Barker.
uh, great, I've been waiting for you.
you have?
uh, yeah.
sorry, my, uh, my dad said that he'd, uh, get me a laptop when I go to college, so, yeah, I just saw it lying here and, and wanted to check it out.
I, uh, I got home the other day and realized that I wanted to send you a thank-you note, uh, thanking you for taking the trouble to interview me, uh, and then I realized that I don't have a home or business address to send it.
that's completely unnecessary.
here's my card.
Thanks.
you gave a great interview the other day.
Southfork is very excited about you.
thank you. Bye.
hello.
Yeah, I just wanted to let you know I'm right around the corner from your place.
I'd ask if I can stop by for dinner, except I smell like I've been rooting around in a sewer all day, which is exactly what I've been doing.
tell me you found the gun.
I wish I could.
we searched that grate you pointed out to us and then we poked our heads down every manhole on the block.
you'd be surprised at some of the things your neighbors flush down the toilet, but there's no gun down there.
I don't understand. It was sitting there, I saw it sitting there.
I don't know what to tell you, Allison. If there was a murder weapon down there, it's gone.
that's good, Marie.
you're a very cooperative little girl.
al, what the hell are you doing out here?
I'm looking for something.
what?
this.
this is the gun that Josh Berryman used to kill Matt Mulhearn.
I think Marie put it in here.
I think tha-that alarm told her to.
no, I didn't.
Marie, I know you did. I saw you put that gun in the trash can.
look, honey, I'm not mad at you.
I just want you to tell me what happened.
don't look at that alarm, you look at me.
look, I know you're scared.
I know that thing has been talking to you, but it cannot hurt you.
it cannot hurt us.
I need you to tell me what it told you to do.
you're scaring me, Mommy. Burglar alarms do not talk.
well, that one does, and we both know it does.
okay, come on, Marie, why don't you go back, see if you can get a little more sleep?
we will talk about this later, okay?
I'm sorry, Mommy.
she's lying!
this thing is making my daughter lie to me!
for God's sake, are you listening to yourself?
I am getting rid of that thing right now.
what are you talking about? They're coming to replace it the day after tomorrow.
do you know how to dismantle that thing?
I can cut some wires.
no. Okay, just do me a favor - give it to me.
if you're dead set on doing this, at least take advantage of the fact you're married to an engineer.
and you do me a favor - don't shock me or anything.
very funny.
just don't ask me where I found it.
am I allowed to ask you what it is?
it's the gun that Josh Berryman used to kill Matt Mulhearn.
look, I know another crime happened while he was in custody.
I know you made nice with the guy yesterday.
just run whatever tests you need to.
you'll see I'm right.
Mrs. Hahn-Barker. I thought you were, uh, were heading home.
I delayed my flight for a couple of hours.
I wanted to speak with you about something.
uh... sure.
I found a file on my computer yesterday, and I think that you put it there.
it's the only possibility that makes any sense.
thank you for not bothering to deny it.
do you know her?
the young woman in the photos?
no, I never met her.
she said the same thing about you.
I spoke with her.
if, in fact, that young boy is my late husband's son...
I've decided to take some of the money that Alan left behind to provide for him.
I'm glad.
so if you didn't know the girl, then you must have known Alan.
putting that file on my computer for me to find, I can only assume you had some score to settle with him.
I've learned an awful lot about my late husband over the last 24 hours.
I can't imagine what would have brought you to Oregon or to Southfork.
the summer program for high schoolers, I'm guessing.
so which one of his lectures on romantic literature reeled you in?
sense and Sensibility?
the Lady of the Lake? That was always one of my favorites.
the Scarlet Letter?
no, I've never been to Oregon.
I have never heard your late husband's lecture.
and I swear that I never met him while he was alive.
you what want to know what should have been my first clue?
your interview.
all those carefully polished answers. You sounded exactly like him.
it is a shame. I liked you.
I actually felt good about championing you to the Director of Admissions.
well... I have a plane to catch.
stop that.
you brought this on yourself.
you didn't need to get involved with him. You didn't need his help.
no.
you're a smart girl.
you're going to get into some wonderful school.
just not this one.
why did you guys rip the alarm off of the wall?
you want to field that one, dear?
it wasn't working right.
O-Kay. But why isn't Marie coming out of our room?
I think she misses the alarm.
okay. - Go get your sisters.
I know Marie's in mourning, but she still has to eat.
Hello?
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you before you left.
I wanted you to know you were right.
according to Forensics, that gun you brought in was used to execute Matt Mulhearn.
sir, that's great news.
I'm not finished.
now, we can tie the weapon to the murder, but not to the man you believe pulled the trigger.
I'm afraid that the gun was wiped clean of fingerprints before you brought it in.
also, the serial number was filed away, so there's no way to trace it.
bottom line is, we simply cannot connect it to Josh Berryman in any way.
so he just gets away with it?
in the absence of further developments, I'm afraid so.
look, I know this hits you quite literally close to home, and I want you to know how sorry I am.
I understand, sir. Thank you.
so, I-I did like you told me.
I-I went to the bar in Avondale, and I bought this from a guy who deals drugs in the parking lot.
and, um, I went to the bank.
um, I-I got a safe deposit box.
but, you know, don't-don't worry, because I-I-I won't spend it till a couple months after the job's done.
but, uh... You got the money, right?
I guess it's really gonna happen, I guess. I'm actually... Gonna kill someone.
listen.
calm down.
it's going to be fine.
just be sure you... Shoot me in the back of the head.
we need it to look like the other break-ins.
so now you know.
I hired Josh to kill me.
that voice.
you sound exactly like... - The burglar alarm?
Yeah.
I'm the man behind the curtain.
I'm Sal.
I apologize for using your daughter.
but after Josh shot me, it became pretty clear that you were going to lead the police to the truth.
and I couldn't let that happen.
she was so fascinated by that alarm.
she really wanted to believe it could talk.
you manipulated my child?
you bullied her so she wouldn't identify Josh in the lineup?
you put a gun in my baby's hands!
I did. And again, I apologize.
but what was I going to do?
Josh left his prints all over that gun, even though I told him never to handle it without gloves on.
and he was supposed to dump it in a lake, not in a sewer grate, where it would just sit there until a city worker found it.
hey... I get that you're angry with me.
but believe it or not, I had a really good reason for doing what I did.
you're not even a little bit curious?
you don't even want to know why I hired someone to shoot me in the head?
not really. Not now.
at the moment, all I really want to do is call the people I work with and tell them about a drug dealer in Avondale who sold Josh the gun.
Oh, and this, uh, brand-new safety deposit box that's got $20, 000 in it.
I had Huntington's disease.
do you know anything about Huntington's?
it's genetic.
I got it from my dad.
you wake up one day, and you don't have control of your body anymore.
your-your limbs move.
they dance.
they writhe.
in the old days, they thought people who had it were possessed by a demon.
there's no cure.
there's barely even a treatment.
it's just a slow, terrible death.
and your family, they get front-row seats.
there was no way I was putting Amy and the kids through that.
not after what I saw with my dad.
so when I realized, I had it, I decided to bow out gracefully.
problem was, I couldn't kill myself.
life insurance doesn't pay out for a suicide, and Amy and the kids really need that money.
I knew Josh was in a pinch.
so he and I, we came to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
an "Arrangement?" Is that what you call it?
you abandoned your family.
you left your wife to see you lying in a pool of your own blood.
I know, it wasn't pretty.
but believe me, it was a lot better than the alternative.
I-I know that you're angry with me.
but this crime that you're running around trying to solve?
it's really just a case of assisted suicide.
with, I'll grant you, a little-- a little insurance fraud thrown in.
but there's no murder here.
not when you really think about it.
you know, if you're not lying, if you really were sick, I'm sorry.
but I have no reason to trust you.
and, you know, it's really the courts who decide whether or not your death was a murder.
your call.
but if you keep dialing, you lose the chance to cooperate with me.
cooperate with you on what?
on what? Did you forget?
Allison, there's a real murderer out there.
he's already robbed and killed five people.
and I'm pretty sure he has no intention of stopping.
one of the only nice things about being dead?
gives you a hell of a vantage point from which to watch the living.
I know an awful lot about this guy.
I can tell you his name, where he lives, where he works.
I know where he hides the stuff he stole from his victims.
I can even tell you the name of the nice, young couple he's planning on hitting next.
if I agree to ignore what you and Josh did.
what's his name?
what?
nothing. I... I was just thinking about what an interesting person you are.
it's kind of a shame we didn't get a chance to know each other, living so close and all.
name.
you should go get a piece of paper.
you're going to want to get all this down.
did you fall in or something?
seriously! You're going to make us late for school!
I told you, go away.
take it easy.
it's 7: 25. Why aren't you guys dressed?
we would be...if Ariel would get out of the bathroom!
she's been in there for, like, 20 minutes.
okay, okay. Ariel, you all right in there?
just go away, Dad.
just go... go use me and Mom's bathroom.
but my toothbrush is in this bathroom.
all right, just your finger. Go on, go on.
whatever it is, we'll figure it out, okay?
No! You can't figure this out.
you want me to go get Mom?
No! Mom can't help me. No one can.
Ariel, come on, now!
all right, open the door. I'm serious.
you want me to go get the key?
Ariel?
help me, Daddy.
what's wrong with me, Daddy?
what's happening to me?
Oh, no.
Ariel, honey, what are you doing up?
it's 3: 58 in the morning. You promised me you weren't going to study past 12: 00.
uh, I... I wasn't planning to.
I just took a practice quiz and realized I had a lot more studying to do.
what are you doing up?
weird dream.
thought I'd get a glass of milk. Do you want one?
mom, I'm trying to stay awake.
honey, come on.
you know I don't like you pulling these all-nighters.
you're not going to learn anything new at 3: 58 in the morning.
I know.
I know. I just...
I need, like, ten more minutes.
and that glass of milk sounds really nice, actually.
while I'm young, Mom.
right.
while you're still young.
Hey, you can't have soda for breakfast. Master Chocolatiers since 1845.
Hey, I'm pretty sure I can.
soda, Ariel, really?
I think it's a little early in the morning for caffeine and sugar, don't you?
but I need sugar and caffeine because I need something to keep me awake for my AP Chem. exam.
more like you need something to keep you awake for your new boyfriend.
did I just hear the "B" word?
Yeah, he's got a name.
never heard of him.
should I have heard of him? - Nope.
nothing to hear about. He's just a friend, and he took AP Chem. last year.
so, he lent me his old notes.
what kind of person keeps their old notes from a high school class?
what are you talking about? A got a whole box full of notes from college.
in the garage.
there's nothing wrong with that. What?
that sounds smart to me.
well, Liam is smart.
uh, and if he keeps a 4. 0 this year, he gets a full scholarship to Stanford.
Hey, can I have some of that coffee? Cause that doesn't have sugar.
you know what? I don't like the way your eyes look.
I know I told you that you could take the car today, but...
I don't think I want you behind the wheel.
not on a couple hours sleep.
no, but I-I need the car.
I'm babysitting Brendan for the Kerrigans tonight.
I need to get there before you get home.
don't worry about it. Come on, we'll work it out.
but I'm going to give you a ride to school.
but...
all right, everyone, pencils down and pass your answer sheets forward.
brutal.
Yeah.
that was a-- that was a tough one.
you look a little tired, Ariel.
are you sure you're going to be able to babysit Brendan tonight?
uh, absolutely. 6:30, right?
thanks again for coming on such short notice.
it's always hard for me to get out of the house when my husband's out of town.
I'm grateful, really.
was there something else?
no.
sorry, I'll...
I'll see you at 6: 30.
she's lost it.
I'm sorry, I mean, I know you like her, and I know you babysit for her, but that test was cruel and unusual.
I'm worried about her.
worried about her? Worry about me.
I'm the one on the verge of flunking.
seems like she's changed a lot since last year.
I mean, I don't know. She just seemed happy.
I guess.
she was the yearbook advisor, and she chaperoned all the field trips, and now she just teaches.
and she doesn't seem to like that very much either.
well... she did just have a baby.
after my mom had my little sister, she couldn't go ten minutes without crying for, like, three months.
speaking of beautiful babies...
hottie at 11: 00.
here he comes. And here I go.
no, no, no, where?
where are you going?
Ariel, come on, you're into this guy.
and I've got about four days of freedom before my parents find out how I did on that exam.
I'm not going to waste them being a third wheel.
I don't-- I don't like him like that.
right. You know, denial is such an ugly shade on you.
Hey, Liam. Hey.
how'd your big test go?
well, if I did even halfway decently, it's totally thanks to you.
and if I didn't, it's cause I stayed up all night studying.
hmm. Yeah, well, you got to pace yourself.
is that how you get a full ride to Stanford?
well, I kind of wish you would've told me that a little sooner.
I have a Spanish presentation sixth period, and I'm starting to worry I might doze off right in the middle of.
well, I don't recommend a steady diet of all-nighters, although I've pulled one or two in my day.
but, uh, if you're really wiped,
I think I got just the thing for you.
hold out your hand.
come on.
okay.
there.
your keys.
Yeah, th-the big one in the middle is for my car.
wait, I don't get it. You want me to drive your car around - so that I stay awake during Spanish? - No.
it's a station wagon. If you fold the seats down, it's actually a pretty good place to take a nap.
it's been my secret exam weapon ever since my mom gave me the keys.
you sleep in your car during school?
Oh, yeah, sure, as long as I have a free period that day.
how else do you think I keep up my GPA?
but I don't know. What if somebody finds me out there?
that's never happened to me.
you want me to wake you up after fifth period?
thanks for the offer, but I don't...
ready to give that presentation?
what?
sixth period bell just rang. Nap time is over.
I don't understand. How did-- how did I get here?
you really were wiped, huh?
no, no, you don't understand. I really don't remember how I got here.
the last thing I remember was...
you and me were on the quad, and you-you offered me your keys.
and now I'm here.
I mean, in between, nothing.
you know what I mean?
it happened again.
Hey, Brendan.
Hi.
no, it's okay.
Oh, oh, oh, I know. I know. Shh, shh.
you want your mommy? Yeah?
Yeah, you want your mommy? I think I want my mommy, too.
okay, okay, okay.
let's see if we can get them on the phone first, okay?
okay. Come on.
miss Dubois.
you ready to give your statement now?
statement about what?
what...
uh, wha-what's happening to me?
Where-where did all the cars come from?
how did I get here?
you called 911.
I was the first officer on the scene, remember?
no, actually, I don't.
what time is it right now?
it's about 8: 30. Why?
it happened again.
Oh, I'm sorry, what happened again? - Ariel!
it's okay, I'm here. Your father's on his way.
everything's gonna be okay.
it's not okay.
okay, something is wrong with me. Something is happening to me.
honey, what are you talking about?
I keep losing time.
in one second, I am one place, the next, I am someplace else.
they are asking me to give a statement about what happened to Mrs. Kerrigan, and I don't remember anything.
I don't remember calling 911.
sweetie, look at me.
it's okay. Whatever it is, we are gonna figure it out.
it's okay. It's okay, I promise.
you okay?
Sarah Bishop.
ms. Bishop.
from down the street.
we just moved in a few doors down from you.
we met last weekend, remember?
I'm sorry, I don't feel well.
I need to call my mom and dad. I need to get home.
your mom and dad?
okay.
I just finished up my last class. If you're sick, I can take you home.
feeling any better?
uh, no. Sorry, I just really want to get home.
well... good news.
we're here.
I thought you said you knew where I lived.
I do.
isn't this your house?
you're home early.
hey there, neighbor. You and Bob finally get all your stuff unpacked?
ready to give that presentation?
Liam, what are you doing here?
I left you a message. Didn't you get it?
my meeting got pushed, so... I came home a little early.
uh... what... what are you talking about-- "home"?
this isn't your home.
I've seen your home.
what's going on?
there's nothing going on, and this is my home.
it's your home, too. We live here-- you, me, and Anna.
who's Anna?
uh, three-foot-eight, likes birthday cake and drawing on the wall in permanent marker, came out of your womb, like, five years ago?
any of that ring a bell?
mommy!
you're home!
six years ago, right after you got your master's.
Bridgette was your maid of honor.
my dad was the best man.
you really don't remember, do you?
no.
when I woke up this morning, I was a teenager, okay, and now apparently, the last ten years of my life have disappeared.
I'm... married.
I have a child.
honey...
please don't call me that.
I'm not your honey, I'm not your wife.
okay, I-I can't be.
I'm in high school.
you teach high school, Ariel, the same as our neighbor Sarah.
okay, I know, I know, you told me that, and I, and I know that you're just trying to help me, but I don't belong here.
okay, I... I need to go home, I need to go to my real home.
okay, I need to talk to my parents.
okay.
okay? - Sure. Why not?
maybe they can figure out what this is all about.
they always have a much better handle on this kind of stuff than I do.
wait, you know?
you know about me, you know about my mom?
Ariel, we're married.
okay, so then, then you think maybe these gaps in my memory, all this time that I've lost, you think it might have something to do with that?
I don't know, but let's go ask the experts. Shall we?
honey, what is it? You look like you've been crying.
mom. Mom.
Oh, slow down.
I don't recognize her.
I don't know who she is.
I mean, Liam keeps telling me that she's mine, but... for that matter, I barely know Liam.
and he's supposed to be my husband?
mom, the last ten years of my life are gone, okay, and I don't know, I was just hoping that maybe you could help me get them back.
so the last thing you remember is the night that Mrs. Kerrigan died?
um, I was with Mom outside her house.
there were police everywhere, and they said that I was, was inside when Mrs. Kerrigan was shot, but I don't remember that.
okay, I don't remember anything except for finding the body.
I mean, I still don't know what happened to her.
well, no one does, not really.
all the police could figure out for certain was that it was an execution.
the killer didn't steal anything, didn't assault her in any way.
just went in and shot her and left.
the police questioned her husband, her ex-boyfriends, even a student that she failed, but no one could ever figure out who did it.
do you think maybe that-that's why I'm here?
maybe I'm supposed to help them find the person who did it.
what are you talking about?
you're here because this is your life.
you're here because you've always been here.
you keep saying that.
you believe that, but I am telling you, to me, I just woke up in this place.
I don't know, may... maybe I'm ill, okay?
maybe there is something wrong with my brain.
maybe there has been something wrong with my brain for the last ten years of my life.
listen, the night that Mrs. Kerrigan died, you told your mom that you were having some problems with your memory, and we took you to see a specialist, a neurologist, and he did every test.
he ran every test he could and he didn't find anything wrong.
and you've been fine ever since--no blackouts till today.
I - I suppose we could run some more tests.
I'm sorry, okay?
it's just, I am so scared.
so much time has gone by.
I have lost so many memories already, and I just-- I don't... I don't want to lose anymore.
first thing tomorrow, we'll take you to another doctor, but in the meantime, just remember, you are surrounded by people who love you
me, Daddy, Liam, Anna.
come on, you-- there you go, oh.
I don't want to go home with them.
I want to stay here tonight. This is, this is my home.
you are my family.
Ariel, whether you remember her or not, you have a child now.
we have a grandchild.
imagine how frightening this must be for her.
don't you think your place should be with her right now?
daddy told me you're having trouble remembering stuff today.
you still remember me, right?
of course, sweetie.
how could anyone forget you?
good night, darling.
you mean "Good night, Panda Bear," don't you?
panda Bear-- isn't that what I said?
panda Bear?
good night, Panda Bear.
I'll see you in the morning.
all right.
she's so beautiful.
Yeah, well, she kind of takes after her mother that way.
what?
do you want me to cover up?
maybe I'll just
I'll cover up.
sorry, I just-- I have a lot of getting used to.
what?
so... let me ask you something.
um, wow, how do I put this?
are, are you here... right now?
I mean, am I having this moment, making this memory all by myself?
no, I'm here right now, I promise.
good... good, because I'm here, too, for you, whatever you need.
so, another crazy question:
um, you and me
as far as you're concerned, we never, um...
no.
no, I may be the only woman who has a child but can't remember losing her virginity.
my cousin the priest would probably say you're the second.
so what do you do for a living?
I manage a hedge fund...
and I'm pretty good at it.
do you remember how we...?
um, it was right after Mrs. Kerrigan died, and you were pretty shaken up and I took you to this restaurant and you started crying right in the middle of dinner, and then I felt so bad for you.
but then we just ended up going to my car and...
and just talking for a really long time...
and I'm pretty sure that was the night I decided I was never going to let you out of my life.
and you don't even remember.
no.
but, uh, what I... what I do remember is, when we were in high school, and you let me take a nap in your car, and you had that orange key chain, and...
...you put it on my wrist like it was a bracelet.
and our hands touched, and I...guess it just hit me that you were the one I wanted to be with.
okay, so, uh, sleeping arrangements.
we should probably make a plan.
if you want, I will stay here with you, but I'm also happy to go crash in the guest room.
guest room it is.
I love you, Ariel.
it's okay.
you don't have to say it.
you just have to know it.
I'll see you in the morning.
Oh, my God!
it's you.
did you honestly think I wouldn't recognize you behind that mask?
no, you can't.
you wouldn't.
not to the mother of your own son.
you don't remember any of this?
Mrs. Kerrigan's husband told the police he was in the Army Reserves.
he was training at a base a hundred miles away that night.
he's lying.
I don't know. His alibi's good. That sounds pretty solid.
I'm telling you, Liam.
he shot Mrs. Kerrigan, and he was wearing a mask, but she knew it was him.
he said it right before he shot her.
so, he-he was wearing a mask, but she still knew it was her husband?
you... saw that?
she called him the father of her child.
and don't you see? Maybe this is why all this is happening to me.
maybe if I prove that Mr. Kerrigan killed his wife, then all of this...
memory thing, this time-skipping thing
it'll just stop.
I mean, that's how it worked for my mom.
okay.
but how do you prove that this guy's lying?
I mean, that was a long time ago.
does my mom still work for the district attorney?
for the district attorney?
no. Not exactly.
Mr. Kerrigan.
thanks for coming in. It's, it's been a while.
Mr. Chief of Police.
Yes. I was surprised to hear from you.
you already know our district attorney, Allison Dubois.
and, of course, Manny Devalos was the D. A.during the investigation.
Mr. Mayor, nice to see you again. - Please.
so, uh, don't keep me in suspense here.
what's going on?
as you know, my daughter Ariel was actually there that night.
it's been our mutual frustration that's she's never been able to remember anything at all about it.
Yes, of course, I remember.
how is Ariel, by the way?
she was always my son's favorite babysitter.
Oh, she's fine, thank you.
as a matter of fact, she's finally starting to recover memories from that night.
are you serious?
well, that's... that's amazing.
does she... Does she know who killed Lisa?
actually, she does.
in light of that, we thought it might be productive to talk to you, see if there was any chance you would like to revisit your account of where you were on the night in question.
what do you mean? Why would I want to do that?
with all due respect, Mr. Kerrigan, your, uh, alibi was never exactly airtight.
I was in the Army Reserves.
I was stationed 130 miles away that night.
is Ariel seriously saying that I killed Lisa?
we're all aware that you supposed to be sleeping at the base that night, but the sergeant in charge noted here that you weren't at that afternoon's marksmanship drill.
you also missed final bed check that night.
I was doing extra... - ...phys... Extra physical training.
by yourself in the middle of the night. We remember your deposition.
but that leaves an awfully big hole in your day.
a man could get a lot of driving done in that time.
what the hell is going on here?
what, are you two up for reelection or something?
are you trying to grab some headlines?
what's going on is, we're offering you a chance to cooperate with us.
you tell us the truth, you can expect a little leniency.
but either way, my office is going to pursue this theory of investigation to its conclusion.
I can't believe you people are making me do this.
you're right.
I didn't tell the truth about where I was that night.
I was seeing someone near the base, a woman.
we met when I first joined the Army Reserves, and every time I went up there, I...
I made sure I got the chance to see her.
even if it meant slipping a 20 to the guard on post so that I could slip off base for a while.
I never told you because I didn't think I had to.
I didn't think I had to because I didn't kill my wife, and because I had hoped to spare her family the knowledge that I was sleeping with another woman on the night she was murdered.
this woman you were seeing-- can she confirm that?
Yes.
her name's Rebecca Moore.
I haven't seen her since I left the Reserves, and we didn't exactly leave it on good terms, but I don't think she wants to see me go away for murder.
you don't remember me?
Brendan Kerrigan. You used to babysit for me.
Oh, uh, of course I - I remember.
I just, um...
I don't understand why you're doing this to me.
either you are a very confused or a very malicious, young lady.
why are you mad at Ariel, Dad?
because she made a mistake.
a terrible, hurtful mistake.
come on, son.
surprise! Happy birthday!
Oh, your twenty-fifth.
it was a fun night.
well, I'll have to take your word for it.
I was just kind of hoping that some old movies would jog my memory, but...
nothing?
it's weird.
these people are my friends. You know, they...
...know me, I know them, but I couldn't tell you one of their names.
you know what you need?
wine.
I know you're only 16, sort of, but the 26-year-old you has a glass of merlot when she can't sleep.
trust me.
works every time.
got a bottle I've been holding on to for a special occasion.
does amnesia count as a special occasion?
thank you.
Oh, my gosh, we're at dinner, and she's, like, "Oh, I'm so tired.
I'm, like, "What, tired? You can't be tired!
you're the one who said you had to work. - Ariel?
Hey. Your mom's on the phone.
Oh, I'll take it in here.
Hello?
sweetie, I know it's late.
I need you to come over here right now.
can you do that, please?
Hey, Mom, what's going on? You okay?
I'm fine, but I need you here.
I need to speak to you in person.
but-but why? - I just had a dream, Ariel.
I know what's going on.
everything that's happened to you, everything you've gone through-- I think I understand it now.
it's about Brendan Kerrigan.
I was always about Brendan Kerrigan.
wait. I don't understand what you're saying to me. What's about Brendan?
I know who killed his mother, Ariel.
I know who killed Mrs. Kerrigan.
but I need to explain it to you in person. I need to...
mom?
can we go now?
Anna, is that you?
mom, who else would I be?
what is it? You look like you're gonna be sick or something.
I was just at home, and I was about to go see Grandma.
we did go see Grandma.
she's right there.
where is she?
inside.
what's wrong with her, Daddy?
seven years.
my mother's been dead for seven years.
she was murdered.
my dad was out of town on business.
burglar came in the house and shot her in the back of the head.
never caught him.
I know.
I didn't.
apparently, it happened the night she called to tell me about her dream.
she said she knew what all this was about.
everything that was happening to me.
she was just about to tell me, and...
...then I was in the cemetery.
with Anna seven years later just like that.
I don't know if I could go through this again, Ariel.
the last time this happened, you never got your memories back.
and you and me-- we...
we had to start over.
I know you don't remember, but...it was...tough.
you sound angry with me...
I'm not angry, Ariel.
I'm not.
I'm just tired.
okay, so who killed Mrs. Kerrigan?
when my mother called, she said she knew who killed her, and then, I just blanked out.
we never finished our conversation, but that doesn't mean it wasn't finished.
your mother wanted to speak to you in person, so you left.
by the time you got to her house, she was dead.
you were the one who found her body.
okay, uh, the last thing that she said to me was that everything was because of Brendan Kerrigan.
that-that it's all about him.
so maybe he knows something.
maybe he, uh...
maybe he learned something about what happened to his mom.
I have to talk to him, or I may-may never find out.
my God, Ariel, do you really want to upset those poor people all over again?
those poor people.
what about us?
what about me?
please... just let it go.
let it go and stay with me.
stay with Anna.
I'm begging you, for the sake of our family.
I...
I can't.
Ariel. What do you want?
I know I'm the last person you want to see, but I wouldn't have come unless it was really important.
I need to speak to your son.
and what could you and Brendan possibly have to discuss?
I'm not sure, not exactly, but I think it has to do with what happened to Mrs. Kerrigan.
the last thing that my mom said to me before she died was that Brendan was the key to everything, that he had always been the key to everything.
Really?
Ariel, your mom was killed seven years ago.
why are you coming here now?
I need to talk to your son, please.
I think you should go.
dad?
is everything okay?
it's you.
you wouldn't.
not to the mother of your own son.
my God.
are you okay, Ariel? What are you doing here?
she was just leaving, Brendan.
you talked to Brendan?
I didn't have to.
I just had to look at him.
Brendan's your son.
you were sleeping with Mrs. Kerrigan. You killed her.
I had to.
she was pregnant. I was 18.
she wanted to tell everybody what we were doing.
she kept saying that she loved me, that she wanted to be with me, that she wanted Brendan to be with me.
I was going into college.
I was planning a life.
I couldn't let her take that away from me.
or my mother.
I always knew there was a chance one of you would get to the truth.
that's what I bought into when I married into your family.
when she called that night,
I listened in on the extension.
I knew she was about to tell you everything, so I drove over to her house.
I beat you there by a couple of minutes.
we're a family, Ariel.
I had to fight to protect what we have.
we don't have anything.
I barely know you.
you lost that time, not me.
you might not know who I am. I know you.
you're the love of my life, Ariel.
stop it!
you killed...my mother.
you told Brendan everything, right?
you didn't?
no.
why would I?
because I followed you here tonight, Ariel.
I knew that if I wanted to keep what we have,
I couldn't let you see Brendan, and the only way to keep you from seeing him was to take away everything that we have.
Oh, God, please. Please don't.
couldn't bring myself to do it before you walked in there.
I love you way too much.
but now I had time to think.
now I know I have to for Anna.
I have to protect Anna.
No! Please!
ready to give that presentation?
Dubois. What gives?
Hey, what...?
don't ever touch me.
I just got the call.
it's done.
and he went to the house?
with the gun?
it was his father's.
he told the police that he was afraid he was going to lose his scholarship.
that he didn't know what else to do.
and Mrs. Kerrigan?
she's fine.
I mean, just shaken, but she's fine.
you know, she's gonna lose her job over this.
I know.
honey, you did the right thing.
you saved a life.
mom?
Yeah.
will you call me Panda Bear?
Oh, I love you, Panda Bear.
I love you, Mom.
I had this friend, back in college.
she used to say there's someone for everyone.
that no matter who you are, there's one person out there who can make you happy.
one person who can make you whole.
I don't know if that's true or not, but it is a comforting idea.
comforting, that is, until you start to think about all the people who never find "the one."
I mean, it's a big world.
you could spend your whole life looking and never find that person.
or worse, you could cross paths with your soul mate and never even know it.
but what if there was a way to prevent these missed connections?
what if you could look at the person who's right for you and just know?
say you were born with something that only one other person in the world had.
then you'd never walk away from your one true love.
wouldn't it be nice?
wouldn't it be a whole lot better?
hello.
Hey, it's Lee. Sorry to call so early, but we just found another woman's body in Centennial Park.
Oh, no.
strangled with a length of wire and left on a jogging path, same as the first two victims.
Manny's on his way, asked me to give you a call.
I'll be right there.
Hey. Honey, I gotta go.
Yeah, I heard.
okay.
Mm. What was that about?
I'm so glad we found each other.
Hey.
Where's Mommy?
Oh. Mommy had to go to work.
Why? What's wrong?
I had a bad dream.
a really bad dream.
the kind where somebody gets murdered.
sweetie, I understand you're scared, but you really have to tell me what you saw.
honey, listen, if somebody got hurt, or-or somebody's going to get hurt, we want to be able to help them.
right?
right? Yeah? Okay.
Hey, Marie, how many, um, how many people were in your dream?
two.
okay. And, uh, and do you know where they were?
they were in a hotel.
I know 'cause there was a towel on the floor that said Shan... Shan-gri-la.
okay, the-the Shangri-La Hotel.
see? That was easy.
and these people, they were...
there was a lady, and a really angry man, and they were in their underpants.
their underpants?
and the really angry man and the lady were wrestling on the bed.
wait. This... this happened on a bed?
he was biting her neck, and she was scratching his back, and she kept screaming, "Yes, yes, yes"!
but it didn't matter.
even though he got his answer, he kept wrestling her.
you want to tell her, or should I?
tell me what?
Hey, Marie, I, uh...
we don't think that you saw somebody getting murdered.
no?
far from it. I mean, those people, they were... - Hey!
what?
I want to know.
they were... they were playing.
they... they liked each other.
so they were playing.
but why didn't they have any clothes on?
I'm thinking that they were washing them.
Yeah. They were probably just waiting for the clothes to come out... of the dryer.
you think that's what it was?
I think that's a very distinct possibility.
their clothes were in the hotel dryer, and they had to wait for them.
so they played.
on the bed.
Yep.
Yep.
makes sense.
okay.
Hey.
I'm really hoping you got something to tell me.
I just got done interviewing the park rangers, and none of them saw anything.
something wrong? Have I got something on my forehead?
no... No, I just, uh...
Lee, uh... these people over here, you don't notice anything strange about them, do you?
I don't know. The reporters, I get.
the rest of them, I always wonder what they do for a living, that they can just stand around watching us...
stand around.
Yeah. I always wondered about that, too.
name's Melinda Sully.
according to her roommate, she commuted to work on her bike.
used to cut through the park if she was running late.
roommate begged Melinda to stop using the park after the killings started, but, uh,
Melinda figured all the murders seemed to be happening first thing in the morning.
our best guess is that, uh, the Strangler assaulted her last night, on her way home.
the forensic team find any evidence we can use?
no, not a thing.
just like the first two victims.
guy's a clean freak.
okay, great. Okay.
just got off the phone with the mayor.
he wants you to know that you have whatever you need to catch this guy.
you both have suns.
you both match.
excuse me?
nothing. - Detective, may I speak with you?
I was just thinking.
excuse me, sir. Do you know that man?
Nope, haven't a clue.
guess there's only one way to find out. Excuse me.
uh, that's okay.
thank you.
Oh, thank... Hey, I'm so sorry to bother you.
I, um, I'm just kind of anxious to talk to somebody involved in the investigation.
well, my name's Allison Dubois.
I'm with the District Attorney's office. Maybe I can help you.
great! I'm Gil Bureli.
I'm, uh, I'm president of the local small business association.
the Centennial Park Small Business Association.
the thing is, this, uh, this man, who keeps killing all these women?
um, the media keeps calling him the Centennial Park Strangler.
and, uh, we, as the Centennial Park Small Business Association, we kinda, you know, we kinda got some concerns about that, you know?
so you don't like what we're calling the murderer.
Yeah. I know, I-I-I know it sounds kinda callous.
I know three women have been killed,
I know this is the last thing on your mind, but honestly, it is, it's really bad for business, and, you know, my colleagues and I, we were wondering if...
if there's a press conference or something and if they can maybe call him by a different name without Centennial Park in it.
I mean, I got some ideas I could tell you...
well, I can't promise you anything, but I'll mention it.
Oh, that is awesome, awesome.
let me give you my card. Thank you so much.
it's got my name and my number on it, if you know of anything.
Gilberto's.
Yeah, that's my restaurant.
I'm cooking supper up there every single night.
come on over.
anyways, uh...so, you know, if anything comes up, just let me know.
okay. Thanks. Thank you so much.
Thanks. - Sure.
so I've read your report, and I have to say,
the client wanted to know if they could apply a plasma-assisted Fischer-Tropsch process to the mass production of Syngas.
that's all they wanted to know.
I've been through this thing twice, and I can't figure out if the answer's yes or no.
I know it's inconclusive.
the results were inconclusive.
I think Lydia and I just need a little more time.
we don't have any more time, Dave.
and I have a really hard time understanding how two qualified engineers can spend the better part of a month working on this thing and not crack it.
if you weren't making headway, you should've come to me.
what happened?
I don't know, it always seemed like the answer was right around the corner.
Lydia? You have nothing to add?
well, e-mail me the document, and I'll spend this afternoon and probably the better part of this evening going through it, and see if I can find a way to salvage this thing.
okay. Thanks.
yeah?
I-I wanted to apologize.
the truth is, I really couldn't focus during the project.
maybe I should've come to you, talked to you about it.
I-I really wasn't sure what to do.
I'm sorry, Lydia, I don't understand what you're talking about.
Dave.
he just keeps coming onto me.
I told him I wasn't interested,
I'm still telling him I'm not interested, but the guy doesn't want to hear it.
it's pretty much impossible for me to work with him.
I'm sorry to burden you with this, but you are my direct supervisor.
she's dreaming.
the woman is out of her mind.
well, she's saying that she can't work with you, Dave.
y-you know what this is. This is her setting me up to take the fall on that report you didn't like.
I swear to you, this is totally bogus.
I mean, we worked late a few times.
I asked her if she wanted to grab some dinner.
same way I'd ask you if we worked late, "Do you want to grab a bite"?
I wasn't hitting on her.
okay. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't know who said what to who.
I'm just saying you're lucky that she came to me with this, because if she felt like she was being harassed, she could've gone straight to Human Resources...
HR? Come on.
look. I know you've got a lot on your plate,
I know we kinda dropped the ball on that report,
I didn't do anything out of line, but if it'll make your life easier, I'll apologize to Lydia.
no, don't do that.
just steer clear of her for a little while, okay?
well, I feel like I gotta do something.
can I at least help you with the mop-up on our report?
uh, no. That's okay. I'll handle the report.
best thing you can do for me right now is just not make this worse.
Hey, Al, you in there?
I'm back here!
girls are eating dinner.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
you have a star!
we're a match! Yes.
I have a star, you have a star, we're a match.
I beg your pardon?
well, ever since this morning, I've been seeing these weird little symbols over people's heads, and I didn't really know what to make of it.
and then I saw Lynn and Lee standing next to each other, and they both had these little sun icons over their heads, and they were a match.
how lovely for them.
and now... I see that we match.
we have stars!
I have a star, you have a star.
we have stars, we match.
are you okay?
Yeah, this is good news, right?
Yeah, no, it's great, it's exciting.
you're seeing love matches,
Marie's dreaming about people having sex.
so I'm just wondering, hey, I'm just wondering if maybe we should take a drive down to the hospital have the neurologist on call take a look at you, see if he thinks this is as much fun as you do.
honey, why? Why would we do that?
well, we would do that because, Al, last year you had a stroke and a tumor.
cause I just want to make sure there's nothing wrong with you.
paging Dr. Bender.
paging Dr. Bender. - Come on.
it's been two hours since we got that CAT scan.
when do you think we're going to be able to see a doctor?
Hey. Doctor's gonna walk in in exactly...
Oh, wait a second, you're the psychic in the family.
why don't you tell me when the doctor's going to get here?
what are you so angry and impatient about?
just trying to make sure you're okay, okay?
maybe just tell yourself you're doing it for me.
I'm sorry to make you wait, Mrs. Dubois.
just now got the results of your test.
I'm Doctor Bennette, and I'm happy to say that there's nothing wrong with you.
nothing at all abnormal in your scan.
if these, uh, if these hallucinations persist, we can take another look, but for tonight, based on what I see, you're fine.
you can go home.
all right. Well, thank you, thank you.
sorry to bring you out here in the middle of the night.
Oh, no problem.
now, do you have any questions for me?
you know, I just have one.
are you seeing someone?
okay, so now you're Cupid?
stop.
I'm just saying.
with everything that's been going on, with everything that I've been seeing?
I think something's trying to tell me that this man and this woman belong together.
that's all.
al, you don't know either of these people.
why are you getting involved?
why are you being such a grump?
come on, babe, this is nice. This is fun.
most of the stuff that I see is so full of darkness and death and...
you know what? This is a chance to do something positive.
this is a chance to make two people very happy.
Oh, my God, you're not actually calling one of them, are you?
shh, grumpy man! Come on, I have a match to make.
Hi. Hello. Dr. Bennette.
this is Allison Dubois.
um, you just treated me, it's Tuesday night.
uh, I just really want to thank you for coming down to the hospital, and, uh, for being so reassuring.
and you know, there was something about you that I just thought we could be great friends.
and I know this great little Italian restaurant.
so, give me a call.
um, 602-555-0147 if you're free.
Mr. Dubois?
what is it, Carter?
I have to get this report out.
I know, you didn't want to be disturbed, but I have Mr. Burroughs on the line?
I told her I was sorry. Is that a crime?
I thought we agreed you weren't going to talk to her at all.
no. No, we never said that.
you never said that. - Yes, we did.
hold on a second. I told you to - You said not to make it worse.
stay clear of her for a few days. - I apologized.
how could that make it worse? - I don't know, David. You tell me.
the company's being sued, all right? She's suing us.
apparently over something that you said.
look, all I said to her is that we had spoken, and that I was sorry.
and that... it was a real shame.
what's a real shame?
that apparently we can't have dinner because we work together, and that maybe if we're lucky, one of us will get fired so it won't be a problem anymore. That last part was a joke.
hold on a second, you said maybe one of you will get fired?
you outrank her.
you've worked on this project longer than her.
don't you see how that could be construed as a threat?
Joe... how am I supposed to know she can't take a joke?
you weren't supposed to be talking to her in the first place!
you know what? Go home!
what?
come on, Joe, this ridicu...
the company's in litigation because of you.
I can't trust you to stay away from this woman.
I don't have a choice.
you're suspended until further notice.
Allison. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.
doctor.
Judy. It's a cozy place.
Oh, I am so glad you made it,
I am so glad you found it.
Oh, hey. I don't know that I've ever had a patient call me and ask me to lunch to thank me before.
certainly never a patient who's, um, how do you think of yourself?
as famous? Or notorious?
I don't think I'm notorious.
I-I don't even really think I'm famous.
I just think I'm me.
I don't know. I find people like you
the idea of people like you-- fascinating.
you two need a few more minutes?
um, I don't think we had a chance to look, yet.
take your time.
Oh, wait. There is one thing.
the chef here's the owner, isn't he?
I think I met him the other day. I'd love to say hello.
Yeah, well, he's usually back there cooking, but I'm not even sure he's coming in today.
his assistant's manning the kitchen right now.
can I give him a message for you?
mm, no. I guess we just need a second here.
I'll stop back.
so I-I, uh, have to ask...
how does it work? I mean...
take me. You don't even know me, and we...
but do you just meet someone like me and see things, or...?
you know, it's different for everyone.
there's really no rules, nothing that you can count on.
although I have to say, I had a very strong instinct about you, when you came into the hospital last night.
what, oh, good news? Bad news?
it's good news.
I mean, I think, although I really don't know your situation.
my situation...
well, it was...
it was kind of a romantic instinct.
I really sensed that you were going to meet this man, and he was going to be the right man for you, and it was going to happen so fast...
but, I mean, I don't know, you could have a husband who you love, and this could be a terrible mistake...
Oh, I have a fabulous condo and a cat who meows when I come home at night and a car I treat as if it's my child.
no. No...Where is he?
when is all this gonna happen?
you don't even have to buy me lunch, now, this is so much better.
uh, well, I don't know, you know?
I really thought it was going to happen today, but now I'm thinking...
uh, you know what?
just forget what I said.
I don't know what I'm talking about. Just...
order something. Order something expensive.
order two things. Order something for your cat!
that was fun. And delicious.
again, thank you so much for coming in last night.
and please just forget everything I said in there.
not on your life.
when I-when I meet him, I'll call you.
Bye. - Bye.
Hey, Lee.
I just wanted you to know
I just got back from sorting through piles of doggy-doo at Centennial Park.
tell me you found something.
that wire was right where you said it'd be.
lab says the blood on the wire's Melinda Sully's.
but they also found some fingerprints on the gloves that were in the bag, and on the bag itself.
we think those belong to the Strangler.
that's great.
well, they don't match anything we have on file but still, it's a hell of a lot more than we had this morning.
what was that? You okay?
uh, yeah. No, I'm fine, it's just a little fender-bender.
listen, Lee, I've gotta go.
Oh, man, I am so sorry. Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm fine. I shouldn't have backed up so fast.
well, it doesn't look that bad.
you know, we should probably exchange information - for insurance purposes. - Oh, right.
you know what? This is my fault. I was going way too fast.
I... God, I was late for work.
I don't know why I think they can't do the lunch rush without me.
you work here?
Yeah, I'm the owner.
you know what? Would you want to...
would you want to come for dinner tonight?
excuse me?
I mean, I hit your car.
I mean, the least I can do is cook you a nice dinner.
you can bring a friend, you can bring your family, uh...
God, bring a bunch of strangers, if you want.
I'm ready to accept your apology anytime now.
Congratulations. Keep it.
you stuck to your guns and created a car accident.
they liked each other.
they had chemistry. I saw it.
Yoo-hoo, are you listening to me?
Hey, you know, you play your cards right,
I might have one match left in me tonight.
what the hell?
according to this, Lydia is going to name me as a party in her suit.
it says I fostered a hostile work environment by failing to take the proper corrective measures.
huh? - What?
it's all right here. These are the papers she served the company this afternoon.
I gotta send an e-mail. I gotta respond to this.
well, how are you going to respond?
I-I don't know. I gotta let them know that...
I'll hire a lawyer or I'll file a countersuit or whatever it takes to keep my name out of this.
I mean, these are lies. This woman's playing dirty.
I got to show her that if- if she's gonna be coming after me,
I'm gonna go after her.
go... you go ahead, just go to sleep.
I-I just wanted you to know I never do things like this.
Oh, okay.
eat till I'm stuffed.
drink till I'm silly.
stay out late with a guy I just met.
I'm a doctor; I'm not an impulsive person.
Oh, okay.
so, why me? Why tonight?
I don't know. You seem nice.
Oh, okay.
and you're cute.
Oh, thank you very much.
someone told me to be on the lookout for a guy like you.
Really? Wow, that's funny.
cause, um...
I've always been on the lookout for someone like you.
do you want some more wine?
uh, yeah.
cool.
it's so beautiful.
I never knew about this spot.
Oh, oh!
I love, love, love it here.
it's like my own private little oasis, my own private little piece of heaven.
it's nice, right?
it's like there's nobody else in the world.
Hello?
it's Lee.
sorry to wake you, but I thought you'd want to know.
the Strangler killed another woman last night.
Dr. Judith... - Dr. Judy Bennett.
you get a hold of anyone?
I talked to Davalos. I told him everything that I know.
so, that's it. Right?
you told him who the killer is, gave him his name, where he works?
Yeah.
I don't understand.
I... I thought that they were a match.
I thought that they were supposed to be together.
she was so nice at the hospital.
she was so nice at lunch, and she trusted me.
and I introduced her to a killer.
no, you didn't actually introduce her.
Yes, I did, I brought them together.
I thought that's what I was supposed to do.
I thought that's what I was supposed to do.
Hey, Joe.
Hi.
so, what's next?
I'm ready to work.
you know, ever since I told you about David, you haven't thrown any new projects my way.
I'm just trying to be smart about it.
trying to find the right thing.
Really?
how hard is it to look?
you know what, Lydia?
with everything that's going on,
I think it's probably not a good idea for us to talk without attorneys present.
so, I'll see you inside.
you were... you were busy last night, huh?
I got a call from my attorney first thing this morning.
he said your attorney e-mailed him, something about reserving your right to file a countersuit.
Yeah, I really don't want to discuss this here.
well, I just want you to know I don't think that's a good idea.
it's just so close to being over.
the company's already talking settlement.
Yeah, well, the company's not the only party named in the lawsuit, so they gotta do what they gotta do and I gotta do what I gotta do.
that really hurts.
Yeah, I think that's definitely gonna leave a mark, don't you?
what are you doing?
this is where you grabbed me when I told you I wouldn't drop my lawsuit.
you asked me to meet you here.
I thought that was weird, but you said it was important.
you said we needed to talk.
remember?
it's good timing, actually, 'cause I was just about to go to my attorney's office.
I'm sure he'll be very interested in photographing my injury.
that's not gonna work.
Oh, I think it's gonna work magnificently.
Joe, come on.
look, I just want things to go smoothly.
and forget your countersuit.
I'm not coming after you, anyway.
I only named you because you're my direct supervisor and I needed to turn the heat up on the company.
but I don't... I don't want your money.
I just want a settlement.
so, why don't you just sit back, let the law take its course?
this'll all be over before you know it.
I can't believe you're just going to let him go.
we have no choice.
forensics just got done comparing his prints to the prints on the baggie and the glove we found near Melinda's body.
there is no match. It's not even close.
no, he is the Strangler.
I saw him kill Judy Bennett.
I-I saw them together.
Bureli admits to meeting Dr. Bennett yesterday.
he described the same car accident you did.
he even admits to serving her a free meal at his restaurant yesterday evening.
but according to Bureli, that's as far as it went.
his employees confirm that he left work alone at the end of the night.
nothing at all to indicate that they were together when Dr. Bennett was killed.
but they were, and he killed her.
I know you believe that, but there's simply no evidence to support it.
we've searched the victim's car, we searched Bureli's apartment.
I can't hold the man any longer.
let him go!
don't look so defeated.
because of you we have the Strangler's prints.
the fact that they're not Gil Bureli's...
but we'll find him, you know we'll find him.
well, look at it this way.
you thought you'd introduced her to her killer, but it turns out you didn't, so that's got to be some relief, right?
she's still dead.
doesn't help me make sense of the fact that I saw him kill her.
you know, there was nothing ambiguous about it.
there was nothing coded or veiled.
I just don't know how I could have been so wrong.
daddy, remember those grown-ups in their underpants I told you about at the hotel?
wow, do I feel left out.
uh, oh, yes, yes, sweetie, what about them?
why were their pictures on the kitchen table?
these are the two people that you saw on the bed together in the hotel?
Mm-hmm. I had another dream about them tonight, and they were doing it again in the exact same spot.
Oh, I think you're wrong, honey.
I know these people; I work with them.
they don't like each other very much.
I don't think they'd play on a bed together.
but they do.
they do it at the Shangri-La Hotel, and I seen it two times now.
so, what you're telling me is that Dr. Bennett is both a victim of the Centennial Park Strangler and the Strangler herself?
I don't know what I'm telling you; I'm just telling you what I dreamt.
Dr. Bennett murdered Melinda Sully.
I'm... dubious.
but it's easy enough to check.
we can take fingerprints off the doctor's corpse and compare them to the ones we took off the plastic bag and gloves we found.
putting aside the question of why a neurologist would strangle a women to death with piano wire, there's a small matter of Dr. Bennett's murder, because I think we can both agree she didn't strangle herself.
maybe there's more than one.
sorry. More than one what?
more than one Strangler.
Mr. Bureli.
it's my friend at city hall.
you know, when I asked you to ask the people you work with to call the Centennial Park Strangler another name,
Gil Bureli wasn't really the name I had in mind.
we solved the stranglings-- at least one of them, anyway.
we found a murder weapon and some fingerprints near the body of Melinda Sully, the third victim.
turns out the fingerprints belong to Dr. Judy Bennette.
what?
wait a second. The lady that was here the other night?
I-I thought she was...
killed by the Strangler herself? Yeah. I know.
doesn't make much sense, does it?
but we've been doing a little research into Dr. Bennette
where she was the night of the first two killings
and it turns out that Dr. Bennette was speaking at a medical conference in Denver the first night, and the second night, she was staying with her sister in Santa Fe, so clearly, she didn't kill these two women.
and obviously, she didn't strangle herself, so we're pursuing this theory that Dr. Bennette killed Melinda Sully, and Melinda Sully alone, and made it look like the work of the Centennial Park Strangler.
now, why she wanted Melinda dead, we're not sure, but we'll figure it out.
right now, we're focusing on catching the actual Strangler, who we both know is you.
Oh, God.
okay, this is... this is ridiculous.
you people held me for eight hours yesterday, and you didn't even charge me.
you can't just keep accusing me of this crime.
do you know what this is costing me?
my face was all over the news last night.
people were just getting up and walking out of my restaurant.
Oh, come on!
excuse me. Excuse me.
are you seriously giving me a ticket?
my wheels are like two inches over the line here.
that's two inches too many, sir.
Oh, this is great. This is great.
it's not enough that the City of Phoenix has completely destroyed my livelihood.
you're going to give me another ticket for parking in front of my own restaurant?
Hey, I got an e-mail you wanted to see me.
does this mean I'm not suspended anymore?
Hey.
Hi.
I, uh, I got your e-mail.
what's he doing here?
well, I want to have a conversation with you both.
well, I don't think I feel comfortable with that.
well, get comfortable. You still work for me, so come on in and have a seat.
okay.
now,
I think we need to put this lawsuit behind us.
I think we need to take this out of the legal realm and deal with it ourselves.
no, we're not supposed to discuss the lawsuit with each other and you know that.
I don't know that.
come on, we're all thoughtful, smart people.
we're the people to whom all this actually happened, not the lawyers, so I think the three of us need to go away, check into a hotel for a day, a week, as long as it takes to work this out.
what's this?
that's the place I think we ought to go.
that's where you want to go?
the Shangri-La Hotel.
you know the Shangri-La Hotel, right?
no?
Oh, it's a lovely little out-of-the-way place.
it's perfect for a couple who wants to file a fraudulent sexual harassment suit against the company they work for but don't want to stop sleeping together.
what are you accusing me of?
you're just determined to make this worse for yourself and the company, aren't you?
you're telling me you and Dave here have never been to the Shangri-La?
cause I drove out there this morning,
I showed your pictures around, and all the staff said to say hi.
they have security cameras in the check-in area.
the attorneys at Burroughs-Strauss are looking at the tapes right now.
so...
Dave and Lydia...
what do you think is going to happen to this lawsuit once we find footage of the two of you checking into a hotel together?
I believe the technical term for what you two were engaged in is "fraud."
so I want your resignations on my desk within an hour, and then the two of you can go home, sit back, and wait for the law to take its course.
honey, come on, you were right by the phone.
hello.
okay, so I did like you said.
I pulled up Gil Bureli's DMV file, and it turns out you were right.
he does have quite a few unpaid parking tickets.
he owes the city of Phoenix about 800 bucks, and it gets better.
turns out Bureli spends his weekends in Sonoma and he owes their department of transportation three times what he owes us, and he ignored a summons to show up in traffic court.
there's a warrant out for his arrest.
a judge sentenced him in absentia.
Oh, that's great. He's going to jail?
Yeah, we just picked him up.
he's going to be a guest of the Sonoma prison system for five to seven whole days.
one of their deputies is driving down to get him as we speak.
what, a week, that's it?
well, hey, come on, it's parking tickets.
look, it's better than nothing.
he'll be locked up, he won't be able to hurt anybody.
maybe we can build a case against him while he's inside.
so congratulations, you got your man for five to seven days.
well done.
bad news?
I just sent the Centennial Park Strangler to jail.
yay for you.
for unpaid parking tickets.
Yeah, he'll be out in a week at most.
I just don't get it.
what did I even accomplish here? I got a woman killed.
correction-- you got a killer killed.
okay, point taken, but still, the real Strangler, the one who enjoys killing women
he'll be out in less than a week.
please,
I did what you wanted
I opened the safe, I-I gave you the money.
please just go.
no, not till I do this.
it's okay.
you don't need to call anyone.
that killer that you just dreamed about
the police just arrested him outside a liquor store a few hours ago.
he was still covered in the clerk's blood.
it's an open-and-shut case. There's nothing for you to do.
you'll understand if I don't take your word for that.
there's some people I work with I need to call.
I just wanted you to know I'm not mad at you for putting me in that man's path, for getting me killed.
when you think about what I did, the punishment kind of fits the crime, don't you think?
I think so, too.
excuse me.
that girl I killed-- Melinda Sully
she was my patient.
she came to me complaining of blurry vision.
I scanned her, told her she was fine, probably just stress.
turned out I was wrong.
she had a pituitary adenoma.
it's a little... little tumor tucked right in back of the brain.
it's tricky to diagnose.
side effects can be devastating blindness, heart disease.
by the time she got a second opinion and found out I was wrong, it was too late to operate.
she sued me.
she had a great case.
she would have made millions and I would have become uninsurable, lost my practice.
so you murdered her?
she wasn't married, her parents were dead.
there would be nobody to pick up the case when she was gone.
well, somebody might have picked it up, but without a victim to point to, the case gets awfully thin.
it's not my finest hour.
that's why I wanted to do everything I could to help you.
that's why I sent you that dream.
that dream-- what does this have to do with that dream?
you saw that cute little heart right above Mr. Shotgun's forehead...
...just like the one I had, just like the one Gil had.
that's Gil's new boyfriend.
they're perfect for each other, don't you think?
what are you talking about?
that robbery happened in Sonoma.
when they put our friend into the holding cell, he was still so high on meth, he could barely see straight.
he took quite a shine to his new cell mate.
Gil tried playing hard to get. He even put up a fight, but it didn't end too well for Gil.
Oh, no.
don't bother.
he just finished smashing Gil's head against the metal toilet in the cell.
the prison medic pronounced Gil dead five minutes ago.
you should get that, Allison.
they're calling to tell you the news.
don't look so upset.
destiny is just destiny.
sometimes two people just find each other.
hello.
these are still frames from a video.
the man wearing the mask is, um, is raping the girl.
I'm almost certain that's your brother.
you raped her, didn't you, you fat weasel?
I didn't do it!
admit what you did, I will stand by you.
I'll get you help.
I don't need help.
I don't want help.
you deserve this.
you know that.
she's going after your brother.
I just saw it, Lee.
okay, we've got it covered, Allison.
if Kira goes after Paul, we'll pick her up.
I couldn't sleep.
please just tell me everything's all right with you.
Paul's dead, Allison.
she got to him before we could stop her.
dad's gonna kill me.
Why? What'd you do now, Mr. Good?
I was in the garage playing with Dad's tools, just looking at them, you know.
and I picked up the new ball-peen hammer.
well, it kind of hit the Buick and made a big scratch.
where the hell did this scratch come from?!
you kids hear me?!
I know it must have been one of ya!
who did this?!
I did.
what are you doing?
it was me.
I did it.
I was the one who ruined our car.
all right, get in here.
take what's coming to you.
stop.
why are you doing this?
why not?
I'm better at taking a smack than you are.
when I say get your ass in here, I mean now!
you don't listen!
you don't listen, damn it!
this is why he doesn't listen!
get up here.
I've had it with you, Eric!
nice dream, huh?
nice memory.
you understand me? ! get up here!
how you doing? You holding up okay? - Get up here! Stand up!
I know I haven't let you sleep much the past week or so.
what can I tell you? - You know what I ought to do?!
get out of the way! Huh?
Hey, don't grab him!
don't grab him!
shut your mouth! Stay down!
whoa, whoa, wait a second, Mr. Good.
you sure you want to go in there?
you haven't had enough sleep.
your judgment's not what it should be.
what do you want?
remember me?
I was here last week.
Yeah, I know. My wife called the cops.
but that was last week.
some reason you're here tonight?
I don't like you.
you guys okay?
Hey! Nobody invited you in here.
this is America, man.
cops can't just bust into your house for no reason.
I got a reason.
how about I know the second I turn my back,
I know you're going to beat him and torture her?!
how about that?!
you okay?
you all right?
Yeah. Just had a dream. Just...
a crazy dream.
what are you doing now?
nothing. It's crazy.
you OK?
there, see? I'm done.
Hello, stranger.
Lee, you got a text.
it's Allison. She wants to know if you're okay.
Yeah, sure. Text her I'm fine.
hello.
is this Ariel Dubois?
Oh, Did I wake you? Oh, I'm sorry.
I knew I should have waited another hour before I called.
who is this?
guess who just called?
you're still not dressed. I thought I told you
if you wanted to drive Daddy's car today, that you had to be up and ready to take Daddy and the girls at 7: 45.
I just talked to my roommate.
my college roommate.
she just called me.
she's from Texas. Her name is Melissa, and she sounds really nice.
your college roommate?
this is really happening, isn't it?
well, congratulations, honey.
I didn't even know that they'd already assigned rooms and roommates.
I know. Me neither. But she got a letter yesterday with my name and phone number. So I should be getting one today.
and she had this really great idea that maybe instead of us flying out to New Hampshire in two weeks, we could take the money and use it to buy a car and drive it out there.
I mean a used car.
this is my favorite part, where you say something so dumb that no one knows what to say.
gonna miss this.
a used car? Drive out there?
what are you talking about?
why would we want to do that?
this is your roommate's idea?
she doesn't have a car either, and Dartmouth is kind of in the middle of nowhere.
so she thought if I had one, she could pay for insurance and we could split the gas.
that's very generous of her, letting you buy it and all.
we're not doing it.
but we already went online, started looking for used car deals around here.
I mean, they're actually quite reasonable.
no.
go on, go get dressed.
or I'm taking the girls to school and myself to work.
this is America, man.
cops can't just bust into your house for no reason.
we are going to follow the process.
thank you very much for coming in.
trust me. - Tell your boy he's done. Done!
got it?
do you mind if I ask you what that was all about?
an unhappy citizen, I'm afraid.
he's sworn out a complaint against our friend Detective Scanlon.
seems there was some sort of domestic violence incident at his home a week ago.
lee was the responding officer.
according to him, Lee showed up at his home again last night for no apparent reason, entered his house completely uninvited and proceeded to physically assault Mr Laurence Raymond in front of his wife and child.
and now he wants the good people of Phoenix to pay him for his pain and anguish.
and could they also please throw that nasty Detective Scanlon off the force and into jail.
so what happens now?
unfortunately, we have to go through the charade of holding a police trial board hearing.
what do you mean charade?
Mr. Raymond is no stranger to the justice system here in Phoenix.
he's got a rap sheet going back over two decades.
now I'm not saying that I don't believe him, but he wouldn't be the first criminal with a grudge to have someone beat him up and then claim a cop did it.
I just resent the hoops that we're all going to have to jump through to make this go away.
what do you mean? What kind of hoops?
well, I'm sure Lee's going to want me to defend him, friends like you to testify on his behalf.
it's... it's a lot of work, a lot of time.
these trial boards are no cakewalk.
it's pretty much a given that they're going to bring up Lee's past substance abuse problems.
he's going to need every positive character witness he can get.
I'm assuming he -- we - can count on you?
of course.
yes?
can I help you?
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for Rebecca.
is this a joke?
uh, no.
I'm here about this ad. About her car.
when did you see this?
when did you speak to her?
I... I didn't speak to her.
a friend and I saw it this morning online.
my daughter hasn't been home in three days.
she or the car.
you wouldn't happen to know where she is, would you?
no. Like I said, I,uh,
I just saw the ad online this morning.
Sam, this girl doesn't know Rebecca.
you don't need to grill her.
I've got the police on the phone.
why don't you go take over for me. Tell them what you know.
I'll deal with this. It's okay. It's okay.
sorry about that. It's just really bad timing.
we don't know where Rebecca is at the moment, much less her car.
I'm so sorry.
I better get back in there.
no, I-I understand.
I just hope she turns up soon.
Thanks.
sorry, but I don't really see the problem here.
all they're gonna ask you is whether you think Scanlon is a good cop.
and all you got to say is that you think Scanlon is a good cop.
no, I know. But what, I just ignore the rest of it?
I mean, he's telling everybody that he never put a glove on that guy, and I saw him beat the hell out of him.
no, you didn't see him do anything.
and you can't be certain whose thoughts or impressions or imaginings you might have been channeling.
and that's an important distinction.
nobody actually saw him do anything other than this guy and supposedly his wife and kid, who are by no means unbiased.
mom?
I need to talk to you about something.
look, I know that you and Dad told me not to even go over there, but I went and I think that something bad happened to her, okay? I think that somebody took her.
okay, we'll make some calls.
I've been looking for an excuse to call Lee. Maybe this is it.
hello.
Oh, no. Did I seriously wake you up twice in one day?
Melissa? Is that you?
it's, like, the middle of the night in Texas.
sorry. I'm just a night owl, and I figured if you didn't want to answer the phone, you wouldn't leave it on.
and besides, I wanted to hear about your day.
my day turned out pretty weird, actually.
but how about I call you back tomorrow and tell you all about it?
not now?
I'm half asleep.
um, uh, give me your number 'cause it doesn't come up when you call.
and I didn't get my roommate letter from Dartmouth today.
sorry. I thought I heard something outside of my house.
I guess it was nothing.
what was that?
Oh, my God! I think someone's trying to break into my house!
go away!
I told you that I don't want to see you! - Melissa, can you see who it is?
hang up with me and call the police.
Melissa? Are you still there? Can you hear me?
but how are you supposed to find her?
it's not like I have her address or anything.
honey, Aurora is a small town.
the police will know where she lives.
any luck?
do the police know who Melissa was?
are they gonna send somebody by her house to look?
Absolutely. The Aurora police knew exactly who she was.
honor roll student, getting ready to go off to Dartmouth.
someone like that's pretty conspicuous in a small town.
but I don't think they're gonna be sending somebody over to her house to take a look.
what are you saying?
why not? Why wouldn't they?
because Melissa Drake's dead.
she has been for 11 years.
what?
what are you doing?
are you waiting on a call from some deceased alumni from our old alma mater?
just checking to see if Lee called me back.
Yeah, I called him earlier about that girl that Ariel's worried about.
you know, the first one.
the one that hasn't been dead for 11 years.
thank you for that.
it's very hard to keep the dead women straight around here.
that's not funny.
he didn't call me back.
I never see him around the office anymore.
he doesn't return my texts.
I haven't even spoken with him since I had that awful dream about him.
Allison, it's the middle of the night.
do you honestly expect him to call you in the middle of the night?
no, I know. I just thought...
I thought maybe I could at least write him an e-mail.
but I won't.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
what do you say?
if you're really sorry, then say it without that smirk on your face!
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!
but I'm not! Oh!
what's the matter, Mr. Good?
can't sleep?
honey, what are you doing up?
I saw your light on. It's 2: 00 in the morning.
can't sleep.
reading about Melissa Drake.
what about you? What are you doing up?
I don't know.
something's on my mind. I went to the kitchen, wrote a e-mail.
she was about to start Dartmouth...
just like me.
and when they found her, she still had her phone in her hand.
the police thought that maybe she was trying to call for help.
I don't get it.
this happened 11 years ago.
so why was she calling me tonight?
I don't know, sweetie.
you realize what you're saying is crazy, right?
I don't think so.
I don't think being honest with someone about how you feel is crazy.
I'm going to college in a week.
I'm packing my trunk. I'm selling my car.
I love you, Rebecca.
you're twice my age.
and you're my uncle.
if you could just listen to me, just put off going to school.
give us a chance!
us? There is no us.
I need to call my mom.
here he is.
you wanted to see me? - Yeah.
come on in, Lee.
so how are you?
you look sleep-deprived.
what can I tell you? I guess not being allowed to do my job doesn't agree with me.
listen, I'm well-aware that pending the outcome of your trial review that the department has ordered you to refrain from any work that might put you in contact with the general public, but...
nothing like a vote of confidence from your peers.
but Allison
or rather Allison's daughter--thinks she might know where that missing girl is...
or more accurately, who might be behind her disappearance.
she has an uncle
ariel is convinced abducted her.
he's a contractor by trade.
made lots of money by taking abandoned and rundown buildings and fixing them up.
he owns properties under lots of names all over Phoenix.
our best guess is that he's keeping this girl in one of them.
why you telling me all this?
I'm on administrative furlough.
I've asked the department to give me permission to get you to follow him.
not to make any actual contact, just keep tabs on him.
see if he leads us to her.
Why? I mean, why me?
there's a lot of other detectives.
Lee, your trial starts next week.
as the man who's gonna go out and plead your case,
I'd like to be able to tell the board, "Hey, this detective's still out there."
he's doing important work. Solving difficult crimes.
and actually, it was Allison's idea.
thank you for that in there.
Hey, I want to tell you something.
I had a dream about you.
it was about everything that happened the other night.
Really?
it was a really weird dream.
how weird?
your brother Paul was in it.
okay.
you were behaving...
well, it was exactly like the man who brought charges against you was describing.
okay, well, now I'm a little confused.
you tell Devalos to twist my boss's arm, put me on this case.
then you tell me you had a dream where I assault a citizen in front of his wife and kid.
Yeah, with your dead brother watching, which makes it a pretty easy dream to dismiss.
plus the fact that I've never seen you act like that in real life.
come on. Lee, this is the part you're supposed to say to me, "No, I never plowed my knee "into that man's nose with his little boy standing there just pleading for me to stop.
I know how this sounds.
I don't honestly know what happened that night.
I don't really remember.
I was working on about 45 minutes sleep, and I still am.
and when I think about it, I don't really care.
are you familiar with the expression, "The end justifies the means"?
I needed that guy to stop beating on his wife and kid.
I sat in my car for a week and I watched him threaten and bully and brutalize them.
and when you thought about it as much as I have, you realize that whether I laid a glove on him or not, that's really kinda beside the point.
what matters is there's no way in hell that he could ever raise so much as a pinky to that lady or that little boy ever again, not without blowing his case.
not without admitting to the world that he needs to be locked away.
Hey, what about you?
I'm worried about you.
don't worry about me. I'm fine.
I just need a little sleep.
thank you for this.
I won't let you down.
Hello, Allison's voice mail.
this is Lee Scanlon, roving detective.
well, either our boy definitely has an unexpected female houseguest or else he has a weird propensity to load up on feminine drugstore products.
I'll call later.
come on, you son of a bitch, make me a hero.
take me home. Show me where you're keeping her.
you're stopping at the dentist?
it's almost 4: 30. Don't you know your houseguest needs her toothpaste?
you're not crying, are you?
wasn't so bad.
Hey, Mr. Good. How you feeling?
nice and refreshed after your little nap?
Oh, no.
what's the matter, you lose something?
Damn!
Phoenix Police Department.
dispatch, this is Scanlon. I need some help out there.
tell me if anyone's got eyes on a gray Ford Focus.
license 8-7-Bravo-Bravo-Golf-Hotel.
anybody hear me? Is anybody out there.
detective, I think I see the vehicle, making its way west down Market.
great. Fantastic.
do you want me to pull him over?
no, no. We can't let him know he's being followed.
I need him to lead me to this girl.
just keep eyes on him till I can get over there and catch up with him, okay?
sorry, Detective, I didn't copy. You want me to pull him over?
No! Do not stop him! Damn it!
what's the matter, bro?
forget to charge your phone?
detective, I'm not hearing you. - Used to happen to me all the time.
he's getting ready to enter the freeway. I'm pulling him over.
No! Do not pull him over!
do not pull him over!
sir, I need you to step out of the vehicle.
No! - That's right, - Let him go! - put your hands on the vehicle, please.
put your hands on the vehicle - Let that man go!
detective, if you can hear me, suspect has been apprehended.
we'll be waiting for you here.
what's the matter, Mr. Good?
having a bad day?
well, don't you worry.
I'm here for you, little brother.
just like I always been.
I mean, how could Detective Scanlon do that?
doesn't he realize that he ruined everything?
I don't know, sweetie. I don't have a good answer.
if that man knows the police are following him, he's never going to go to where he's keeping his niece.
I mean, he'll leave her there to rot.
I realize that.
I'm sure that Detective Scanlon realizes that, too.
so what now?
I don't know. Sleep, I guess.
you okay?
Yeah.
go back to sleep.
come on, Mr. Good.
it's going to make you feel so much better.
come on, smoke it.
Oh, man, what the hell is the matter with you?
are you sure we're even brothers?
I spent the day today leading police detectives through all of my properties here in Phoenix, assuring them that I have absolutely no idea where she might be.
so now in order to get the investigation back on track,
I am funding a $100, 000 reward for any kind of information...
bad time?
that might lead to her safe return... - Is there any other kind?
come on in. - We just want our Rebecca...
Lynn's at work. Baby's at day care.
so if anyone out there has any information, - please come forward. - It's one of my many admirers.
call the hot line. You can call anon...
I had another dream about you.
was it a happy dream?
tell me it was a happy dream.
well... I liked the ending.
you were staring temptation in the eye and you told it to go home.
you put it back in the trunk of your car.
back under the wheel well.
I know this dream.
was your brother in your version?
excuse me?
your dead brother Paul.
in my dream, he was egging you on.
he was pushing you to fall off the wagon with all his might.
no. My brother was not present in my version of the dream, but then again, I don't really need any help falling off wagons.
be that as it may you know, he's haunting you.
if anyone deserves to be haunted...
you've done nothing to deserve this.
he's a bad guy, Lee.
bad in life, bad in death.
which is why I came here to tell you, he is working you hard.
so if you feel like... like you're gonna fall, if you feel like you're going to hurt yourself, call me.
you know, I'll keep you steady. I'll help you.
cause this isn't a fair fight.
I don't know, maybe it kind of is.
why would you say that?
well, I always just kind of assumed you knew.
knew what?
you remember that night you dreamed that lady was going to kill my brother?
you called me to warn me.
I told you that it was too late -- it already happened?
I lied.
it hadn't happened yet, but it sure sounded like a good idea to me.
Oh, my God.
my God.
you let him die.
you-you let her kill him.
like I said, the end justifies the means.
you still going to be there to help me?
you still going to keep me steady?
I don't know.
give my best to Lynn and the baby.
I'm sorry, sir. I don't know if I can go through with it.
I mean, I know that there are plenty of people willing to testify on his behalf.
I think it will all be fine without me.
I'm sorry, sir.
thank you.
how'd he take it?
he sounded, uh, disappointed, puzzled.
well, it is, you know, puzzling.
excuse me?
tell me again why you're mad at the guy.
because I called him.
I told him,"Your brother is going to die tonight."
he did nothing. He just let it happen.
so?
so a man died unnecessarily.
a man who rapes and tortures women.
young girls, actually. Who knows what else?
I think that's beside the point.
sorry, I disagree. That is the point.
Hey, I'm sorry. I dreamt it for a reason.
I dreamt it so I could warn him.
says you.
I mean, it looks like it was his destiny to perish that night, Allison.
it sure looks like it was his fate.
clearly it wasn't, or I wouldn't have had that dream.
I wouldn't have been able to warn him.
okay, so let me get this straight.
so if for some reason we'd stayed up late that night, if we hadn't gone to bed, one of the kids was sick or something, you didn't have the dream, so you didn't call Scanlon, and his brother still died, then that would have been okay?
but I-I did get to bed.
I did have the dream, I did make the call.
wow, so you're really important.
you're like an instrument of God or something.
Hey, I didn't say anything like that.
well, you did, kind of.
you're saying that fate can have one plan, but that if you have a dream that contradicts it and people ignore it...
this is a ridiculous conversation.
Yeah, you're right, but I didn't start it.
a friend of yours has a brother who deserves to die, dies, but because you had a dream about it and told him so and he did nothing to stop what seems likea pretty fortuitous thing, he's a bad guy?
that's not all of it.
what? You mad because he didn't take drugs?
he beat that guy up the other night.
he denied him his basic civil rights.
that's the bad guy's version.
your friend doesn't remember what happened and he needs your help.
fine. Except I dreamt he did it.
I'm sorry, there were dead people in your dream that night, Allison.
doesn't that at least give you pause?
okay. I'm going to sleep.
Rebecca, don't panic.
it's me.
sorry I was gone so long. I know I said I'd be back last night, and believe me, I wanted to be. I know you must be hungry.
I know, I know. Shh, shh. Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
I know.
I'll take your gag off in a minute.
I also...
I got you some pills.
to calm you down.
went to a dentist and convinced him that I needed a root canal.
he kept saying he didn't see anything on the X-ray, but I didn't care, I just let him do it.
cause I want you to relax.
let's talk for a second.
tell you something that you don't know about your uncle.
11 years ago, I was doing some contracting work out of state, and there was this girl.
did you ever hear of that expression "love at first sight"?
I approached her, couple of times, in fact, but...
she acted like she wasn't interested. Okay.
but I knew...
I knew what I knew. And I knew what I felt.
so I just showed up at her house one night.
kind of... broke in.
anyway, I made my case.
I told her that I thought that this was serious.
now, she was getting ready to go off to college, kind of like you, and I asked her if she would put that off.
well, she got kind of hysterical.
one thing led to another, and I sort of broke her neck.
you want one of those pills now?
what I'm trying to tell you is that two really interesting things happened to me when I killed that girl.
one, obviously, I got away with it.
the other thing
and I don't know what to tell you about this
no guilt.
I don't want to kill you.
but I want you to listen.
there's got to be a way for you to convince me that if I let you go, you will never tell anyone about any of this.
I'm certainly not gonna say anything.
I'm sorry. Is this...?
absolutely, Mr. Helling.
my name is District Attorney Manuel Devalos, and I've been waiting for you.
when they called, they said this had something to do with my niece, so I came right over. Is this my garbage?
I certainly hope so.
this garbage is really the reason
I asked you to come down here this morning.
I was hoping to get you to sign an affidavit specifying that all this is indeed yours.
or was yours.
technically, it becomes city property once you put it in the can.
what's this about?
uh, your DNA.
I'm still not following.
look... Mr. Helling, if I can get you to admit that all this is yours
and I think we both know that it is
then I don't have to get a court order to swab your cheek.
of course, you could volunteer to let me swab your cheek, but I'm guessing you might be reluctant to do so.
why in the world would you want to swab my cheek?
you don't still think that I had something to do with Rebecca's disappearance?
actually, Mr. Helling, this isn't about your niece's disappearance.
we're looking for evidence to connect you to a murder that took place in Aurora, Texas, a little over a decade ago.
you remember Melissa Drake.
you did construction work for her parents.
how-how do you know...?
a little birdie called me.
actually, it was a little birdie's mother.
I take it you remember Melissa.
I remember Melissa.
she was killed, by a burglar.
maybe she was and maybe she wasn't.
but whoever entered that house ended up in a hell of a fight.
and we know this because the coroner found someone else's skin beneath her fingernails when he autopsied her.
of course, back then, DNA was still a pretty exotic thing.
if you actually found some on the victim, there were no databases of DNA to compare it to.
you see where I'm going?
you know, they're rather aggressive with the death penalty down there in Texas, Mr. Helling.
over 125 sentences carried out in the last five years alone.
tell me where Rebecca is, and I might be persuaded to talk to my counterpart in the Lone Star State, recommend some form of leniency.
she was very malnourished and obviously in a state of shock, but other than that...
Helling signed a full confession.
my only regret is that the district attorney in Aurora, Texas, is going to get first crack at him.
thank you.
I honestly don't know how any of this would have happened without you.
actually, I didn't do anything.
I just answered the phone and had a dream.
be that as it may, you sure I can't persuade you to attend a school closer to home?
you hear that? Do you hear that?
okay. I'm going to go pack now.
Bye.
well, I better get back to the office.
I still have a mountain of work to do before the trial board hearing for Lee tomorrow.
listen, um, if you're still interested in me testifying,
Joe and I have been talking about it, and it's like, it's like when we spoke the other morning.
I mean, none of this sounds like the man I know.
and I am happy to testify to that.
and we'd be thrilled to have you do it.
evening, Mrs. Raymond.
you remember me, right?
I'm the fellow who came between your husband's fist and your face.
my husband's due home any second.
if he sees you standing here...
your husband's busy trying to boost hot flat-screens off the back of a semi on Route 60.
I do my homework, Mrs. Raymond.
why do you look so scared? You got no reason to be frightened of me.
if anything, I should inspire confidence in you.
maybe it's because I've seen what you're capable of.
you know, I heard that that was your version of what happened that night.
me? I honestly have no recollection.
I find that hard to believe.
no, it's true.
memory is a funny thing, you know?
one day, everyone's calling you Lisa Raymond.
you can barely remember when your name was Claudia Wallert.
busted twice for possession, second time with intent to sell.
what do you get for that in Cleveland?
three years minimum if convicted. But then, uh, you weren't convicted.
in fact, you never even showed up for your court date.
no wonder there's still a warrant out for your arrest.
that was a long time ago.
I was a different person then.
Oh, no. Hey, I get it. You were a desperate woman.
I'm a desperate guy.
yeah... memory's a funny thing.
are you testifying at my trial board hearing tomorrow?
okay. Don't answer.
I heard you were.
uh, new subject.
so what do you think would happen if I were to call the Cleveland PD and let them know where you've been making your home lately?
how long do you think it would take them to send someone here to collect you?
how long do you think your little boy would last if you left him here with his father?
wow, this is great. This is fantastic.
you showed. You made it. You're here to help me.
you're here to keep me steady.
no, actually, I'm not. I'm here to have Devalos take me off the witness list.
Hey, I know about your little visit with the wife of the man that you assaulted.
I know that you threatened to put her child in harm's way.
what?
I never said anything of the kind.
no, no, you're right.
you know what, you didn't say it, but your meaning was clear.
I'm fighting for my life here, Allison.
for my job. For my future.
I haven't slept in - what year is it?
I thought you understood.
hell, you're the one who told me I'm being haunted, it's not a fair fight.
I'm just trying to even up the odds here.
well, I think you're doing a great job of it.
and you know what, at the end of this thing,
I think you'll get your job back.
and at the end of this thing,
I think you'll get back everything you started with, except for my friendship.
and you want to know why?
cause I can't even recognize you now.
what's the matter Mr. Good, can't sleep?
you know, he's haunting you.
if anyone deserves to be haunted...
you've done nothing to deserve this.
well, I always just kind of assumed you knew.
knew what?
do you remember that night you dreamedthat lady was gonna kill my brother, you called me to warn me,
I told you that it was too late, it'd already happened?
I lied.
Oh, my God.
you let him die.
I'm fighting for my life here, Allison, for my job, for my future.
I think you'll get back everything you started with, except for my friendship.
Lee, are you here?
do you have the baby?
Yeah, I got her. I'm in the kitchen.
Oh, what happened?
did you wake up hungry and Mommy not here?
did Daddy give you a bottle?
he didn't feed her; I...I fed her.
who are you? What are you doing in my home?
Oh, I'm-I'm Paul, Lee's older brother.
beautiful kid, yeah.
I fed her, and she gobbled it right up.
it's not formula.
something better.
something I whipped up myself.
what are you talking about?
she doesn't eat solid food yet.
Oh, I don't know, she loved this.
you want some?
I put the leftovers in the fridge.
Lee, you okay? -Yeah.
same thing. I can't sleep.
nightmares, nothing but nightmares.
Lee, how long can this go on?
I don't know what to tell you.
I've seen three doctors, taken all kinds of pills.
I want what you want I want to sleep.
I want to get some rest.
Hey, I'm sorry, Mr. Good, Mrs. Good,
baby Good.
am I keeping you up?
well, don't worry, it's a short-term problem.
the dead don't sleep.
now, according to this,
hanover, New Hampshire, is a little over ten inches away from Phoenix, so that's about...
...2, 500 miles away.
excellent work, Bridge.
your math teacher would be very proud.
Yes, bravo on the math, but I'm a little worried about how gleeful you are about your sister being so far away.
Hey. I take good news where I can get it.
that's so far away. Yeah.
the only way that she could be any farther would be if she went to school in a foreign country or something.
that's too much to hope for.
Bridgette. If we're lucky, we'll never have to see her again.
but I don't want to never see Ariel again.
Bridgette, you're starting to scare her now.
don't worry, sweetie. We're going to see plenty of Ariel.
we're all going to fly up there for parents weekend, and that's less than two months away.
who has been going through my stuff?
I told you two to stay out of my room while I am packing.
you know, it just occurred to me
I'm not a parent, so why do I have to go to this parent weekend thing?
I'm talking to you.
I can tell that somebody has been nosing through my stuff and messing up my piles, and I want it to stop.
Ariel, I would never touch your things.
okay. Now, what about you?
first of all, I haven't even been in your room.
second of all, why would I even touch your cootie-ridden stuff in the first place?
we've done a wonderful job, darling.
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
Ariel, are you still taking the girls to school?
do I have to?
think someone could use a good walk.
she must have been adopted.
Dartmouth.
you done good, kiddo.
grandpa?
Oh, yeah. Been a while, hasn't it?
you know, when we last saw each other, you were wondering what teacher you were going to get for fourth grade.
okay, quit staring at me.
it's making me uncomfortable. What's the matter?
you never saw a dead relative before?
no.
well, relax.
I'm around more than you think.
and I like to keep an eye on things.
and I even check in with your mom, you know, from time to time.
which is why I am glad that you are finally old enough to, uh, handle a visit from your dear old departed granddad.
cause you got a problem.
I have a problem?
indeed, you do.
see, you're going off to school in a few days.
very excited, and who wouldn't be?
but your sister is having a very hard time with it, and you are so busy, you don't even notice it.
she's upset, and she feels that she's going to lose you forever, and if you don't do something about it before you leave, she is going to have a very rough go for the next few months.
okay. Well, how do I help?
and what... what do I do?
who do I look like, Dr. Phil?
I don't know how girls talk to each other, and I don't want to know.
I see a problem, I point it out.
you have a sister issue.
fix it.
girls are in the kitchen waiting.
okay. I'll be right there.
if you and Bridge could lower the volume on the sisterly love, that would be great.
I think it's really starting to affect Marie. Of course.
actually, I'm a little concerned about Marie, too.
don't worry. I'll take care of it. -Good.
I've been waiting for you.
my name is Caroline Krueger, and...
I need your help with something.
I figured if I got to you early, before there were a lot of people around, this would be easier.
I'm sorry. Did one of the paralegals send you over?
or the district attorney or...?
no. No one sent me over.
no one can see me.
no one but you.
so you're...
going on ten months now.
I won't bore you with all the gruesome details, but I'd really like it if someone would let my folks know.
okay.
how do you spell your name?
uh, Krueger, with a "K.
like Freddy.
uh, first name Caroline, with a "C.
so, yeah, I'm buried out in the Sonora desert.
right past the Yucca exit on Route 18.
there is an old abandoned well on the eastbound side.
I'm about 40 yards behind it, and about four feet down.
uh, I'm wearing this.
I can hear my mother praying every day that they find me.
I...
it'd be nice if she could move on.
she's dead, sir.
someone murdered her.
I think I know where her body is buried.
it's off of Route 18. The Yucca exit.
unfortunately, Yucca's outside our jurisdiction.
they have their own DA, their own sheriff's department.
I don't think I can call them and suggest they start scouring the desert for this girl.
they wouldn't really have to scour.
I mean, she gave me a very clear idea of where we could find her.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Yucca's not my favorite place.
uh, I'm not crazy about the way they do things there.
what do you mean? What's so different about the way they do things in Yucca?
forecast says it's going to hit 115 today.
sure would break my heart to see one of you cupcakes catch a sunburn before you're done digging that hole.
don't worry, Mr. District Attorney.
if she's down there, we'll find her.
I have every confidence, Sheriff Guillory.
so these people that come to you, tell you things, like where this girl is supposedly buried they're all...?
dead. Yeah.
that's a handy gift if it really works.
Hey, Sheriff Guillory!
I think we've got something!
well, at first glance, she would certainly seem to match the description of the missing young lady.
I am impressed.
now, you have any clues about who might have done this?
no. I'm sorry.
well, I guess that's my job.
but if you have any more chatty visitors from the other side, you give me a call, okay?
of course.
ma'am.
Mr. District Attorney.
sheriff.
all right, let's finish the job. Let's get her out of there.
wow, I didn't even know that there were chain gangs anymore.
Ah. That's 'cause you haven't spent any time in Yucca County.
around here, you're convicted of a crime,
sheriff Guillory fits you for a pink jumpsuit and assigns you to a work crew.
the ACLU hates him, but the voters love him.
this whole experience was so unexpected.
I mean, on one hand, you look at him, and he seems so awful and cruel.
having prisoners wear those pink jumpsuits and parade around on a chain gang.
well, remind me never to get a speeding ticket in Yucca.
Yeah, but on the other hand, he was very deferential to me, like he was really impressed that I came through for him.
I'm very happy for you.
well, he's got his work cut out for him now figuring out who killed this girl.
I mean, come on.
she told me everything about where she was buried.
couldn't she just take a few extra seconds and tell me who did this to her?
life is full of mysteries.
so, apparently, is death.
did you notice how nice
ariel and Marie were to each other tonight?
I think they're really going to miss each other.
I just wish that Ariel and Bridgette had that kind of relationship.
I love you, too.
nice.
who did you have to call to get us in here?
you know, when, uh, you said "a room,
I figured you meant hotel room.
it smells like urine in here.
whatever.
still going to cost $100.
it's okay.
I'm good for it.
sorry.
nobody's that good.
if you want to play, you got to pay.
well, then, we got a problem,'cause...
I don't have any money on me.
no. Actually, you got a problem.
I'm out of here.
okay. Look... - No, you look.
we came here to do something, and we're going to do it.
I swear I've seen his face before.
well, you might have seen him on the news.
he was murdered a year ago.
beaten to death by a woman.
given this fella's history, it sounds like some sort of poetic justice.
Yeah, a lot of people thought so at the time.
so, what do we do now?
well, we don't do much.
unfortunately, you're not in my employ.
a fact I'm growing to regret more and more by the second.
anyway, to answer your question, her parents deserve some closure, so I'm going to see if I can figure out just where the hell this bathroom is, maybe find a way to put this Scanlon fella in there with her.
you know, I... I didn't actually see the murder.
but, in your dream, she was wearing the same clothes.
Ah, sort of makes sense.
still the best lead we got.
you met her folks?
nice people.
probably not going to mention the prostitution part of the story.
he wasn't going to pay her anyway, so it sort of seems beside the point.
besides, it's tough enough for a parent to bury an 18-year old.
they don't need to know the rest of it.
well...
I'll call you when I know something.
I'll call you if I dream something.
deal.
Thanks. -Yep.
ariel Hey, Marie!
over here. Over here.
Hey, what are you doing inside the computer?
I'm not inside the computer, silly. I'm on my laptop.
I'm just trying to show you that even though I'm going to college on the other side of the country, we can still see each other every day, just like this.
Wow. That's amazing.
where are you?
in my room.
you mean in my room.
it's not your room yet, Bridge.
no, but it will be soon enough.
okay, you know, what's your problem?
I don't have a problem.
I just think it's funny that you think talking to your sister through a computer is going to make her feel better about you going away.
well, it kind of does.
no, it doesn't.
okay, I asked you before, and I'm going to ask you again...what is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
well, you sure act like you do.
no. I think what's throwing you off is that everybody else around here is acting like it's the end of the world just 'cause you're going away.
me? I just want you to be gone so that my life can begin.
that's really mean, Bridge.
I don't mean it to be mean. I mean it to be honest.
I don't care that you're going away.
I care that I get your room.
I care that the bathroom drawers will have less junk in them.
that you're not going to be here?
sorry. Don't really care.
think about it.
we don't do anything together.
you don't talk to me, and when you're not ignoring me, you're looking at me funny.
what is there to miss?
fine.
I'll miss you, Ariel.
I know.
I'm going to go finish packing.
so my brother's a murderer now, huh?
I just got off the phone with a deputy from Yucca County.
wanted to know if I had any of my brother's personal effects, if I knew anything that might connect him to the murder of Caroline Krueger.
that's it?
you got nothing to say to me?
I had a dream. -I heard that.
you had a dream about my brother, and instead of picking up the phone and calling me, you drive out to East Nowhere and tell everything to Andy of Mayberry.
Thanks. I guess we're not friends anymore, but thanks for the professional courtesy.
you know I'm a detective?
well, hey. Of course, I know you're a detective.
and, of course, I know now that you would want to check this out, but, honestly, I'm just thinking about this girl.
I mean, think about everything that's been going on around here.
with you, with us.
no, no. I get it.
I don't like it, but I get it.
you think my brother's a murderer.
of course, you do. How could I forget?
look at what you think of me.
Hey, my sister called.
she said everything's a go for her to pick up Bridgette and Marie before we go to the, um... the airport.
and, um, she said, if we wanted to stay for a couple of extra days in New Hampshire, she's happy to hang with them.
are you listening to me?
who you expecting a message from?
Oh... nobody.
Lee.
Lee? I thought you weren't speaking to Lee.
well, I...I'm not.
or I wasn't.
only now he's not speaking to me.
and I don't know why it bothers me.
Ah, the worm turns.
excuse me who's the worm in your version of the story?
don't ask me.
I'm not the one checking my cell phone every 30 seconds to see if the person I'm not speaking to has called.
well, I guess I'm the worm.
I mean, I should have called him. I should have told him what was going on.
I really had no reason not to.
well listen, Wormy.
the good news is, tomorrow is another day.
what do you say we get some rest?
Hey, how sure are you about that "tomorrow is another day" thing?
I have it on good authority.
besides, if I'm wrong, we'll never know.
what are you doing?
we're done, right?
I thought you were done.
I need to go.
I really do. I need to go.
people are going to miss me.
we're not done.
Oh, God, please.
I hurt.
I hurt so bad.
and I need to go, please.
I won't tell anybody about this. I promise.
just, please, I need to go.
what is that?
is someone coming? -Shut up.
you make one sound, and I'll kill you. You understand me?
well, hello there, Mr. Good.
so when did you find out your brother was back in Phoenix?
is this what you not talking to me looks like?
cause I'm starting to think you don't understand the concept.
come on. You know as well as I do.
couple of days before he died.
Devalos pulled me into his office.
you're lying.
you're lying to me.
you've been lying to me this whole time.
you knew he was back months before that, because you were with him the night that he murdered Caroline Krueger.
you're crazy.
come on, Lee.
come with me.
we have to talk to Sheriff Guillory about this.
you have to tell him that you know where that restroom is.
you have to tell him that you can place your brother there the night of the murder.
Lee, come on.
this girl's family deserves it.
her family deserves to know the truth.
you're out of your mind!
Hey, I saw you there!
you saw me where?
in some desert restroom where you say my brother killed some woman?
I don't think so,'cause if I was
I wouldn't have had to spend last night crawling around every toilet within spitting distance of the 18.
so, last night, you're looking for where this girl died?
I'm a detective, Allison.
my brother's being accused of murder.
I think he's probably the lowest form of life, but I don't think he's a murderer.
so, yeah, last night, I went on a tour of toilets.
and did you find anything?
this is Marist Park in Yucca.
this is the restroom nearest the entrance.
do you think that's where it happened?
you told Guillory you saw tags on all the walls, right?
Raggz" with two Gs and a Z.
well, turns out there's a branch of the Raggz gang that does operate on the outskirts of Yucca.
and guess what.
marist Park is part of their territory.
so, I started looking last night after my shift was over, and I did find one restroom I think is a maybe.
now, is it the restroom you dreamt about? I have no idea.
but I did walk inside, and I just had a feeling. It's a detective thing.
and, I mean, I know the place must have been cleaned a hundred times since the night Caroline Krueger disappeared.
I know the odds of finding any evidence that a crime took place in there are virtually nil.
I was just about to leave... when I heard something.
they got one of those new lights in there with those, uh, environmentally friendly lightbulbs.
they last about a hundred years, but, uh, they make a buzzing sound like a...
a bee that's had too much coffee to drink.
and that's when it hits me.
they don't clean lightbulbs, Allison.
so maybe... just maybe ...
if the killing did happen in this particular bathroom and if it was violent enough, and if, in fact this is a bulb that was in there when this supposed killing happened, there may just be some blood or some DNA or something on it.
the girl's, and hopefully somebody other than my brother.
well, so where's the bulb now?
are you having it tested?
couldn't get to it.
they got an aluminum box over it.
you need a key to get it off.
I was going to call your new friend, Deputy Dog, and ask him if he could meet me over there to help me unlock it.
I was even going to suggest we bring the bulb back here let the city's forensic lab run the DNA analysis.
assuming there is some DNA.
assuming we have the right bulb.
assuming we have the right bathroom.
you get the idea.
well, you want me to call him?
what, now you're my friend again?
I know how to dial a phone.
feel free to call your buddy Guillory tomorrow.
ask him about all the fun we had at the, uh, restroom in Marist Park.
after that, I don't really care what you do.
what you doing?
I don't know.
just looking at my ceiling one last time.
you excited about tomorrow?
excited.
scared.
but excited.
how about your good-bye to Marie and Bridgette?
Oh, yeah.
took Marie out for ice cream.
showed her how to use the computer again so we can video-chat.
gave her that backpack I had in middle school-- the one that she's always wanted.
and Bridgette?
I don't know.
she waved when I took Marie out for ice cream.
asked me to bring back a sweatshirt from Dartmouth.
I don't understand.
I guess she was right.
I guess we never really were that close.
but you're sisters.
but I can't make her miss me, Mom.
she doesn't want to give me a hug.
she doesn't want a big good-bye.
all she wants is this room.
so I guess that's the least that I can give her.
you know, I've been thinking about that.
you don't have to move out of here.
I mean, this is still your family.
you're going to need somewhere to stay when you come back on breaks and vacations and...
no. She really wants this room.
well, and I'll, uh... I'll sleep with Marie in the bunk beds when I come home.
you know what's funny?
I think I'm going to miss her.
Oh, babe.
92, 93... And if you do this a hundred times every night, your hair will never tangle and it will always shine.
a whole hundred?
a whole hundred.
will it shine like yours?
cool.
you forgot about that, didn't you?
you taught her about brushing her hair.
about carrying numbers over in long division.
about all kinds of things.
what are you doing here?
and are you the reason I just had that dream?
like I told you, I am very worried about your sister.
cause I don't think you appreciate how much she depends on you and how much she is going to miss you when you're gone.
wait, the other day when you were here, you were talking about Bridgette?
well, hello there, Mr. Good.
he's here.
just like you said he would be.
Yeah.
he may be a lousy brother, but he's always been a good cop.
a good cop and a great detective.
come on, Sherlock.
a crime has been committed.
you can solve it.
think, baby brother.
think, think, think, think, think, think, think. Come on.
you're getting warmer, baby brother.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, you are.
like a moth to the flames.
you're on fire, Mr. Good.
you're on fire, baby.
pretty good, huh?
we had you completely fooled, didn't we?
you looking for me?
lee was telling the truth, wasn't he?
he'd never been in that bathroom before last night.
and even though the two of you were there he couldn't see you because the two of you are... Sleeping the big sleep.
look at that.
you got it all figured out.
you thought you were looking at the past, but you were really looking at the present.
that was just a little play that Caroline and me put on.
staged for an audience of one.
I-I don't get it.
why would you want me to think that Lee was with you the night that you killed Caroline?
and why would Caroline help you after all you've done to her?
good question.
why would Caroline help me after I beat her to death ten months ago?
unless... You didn't do it, did you?
I didn't even meet her till we were both on the other side.
that's when I found out about people like you.
people who could see me.
people who could see what I wanted them to see.
if you didn't do it, then who did?
and why did you go to all this trouble to make me think it was you?
well, maybe I knew that it would only be a matter of time before it got back to Lee, and maybe I knew that if he thought I was involved in a murder, there's no way he'd just be able to sit on the sidelines.
uh-uh, no.
he'd find that toilet you'd been dreaming about, he'd go there and he'd figure out the one thing that might clear me and then he'd bring it to the attention of the man who really killed that poor little whore.
you know, it's tough being a strict law and order man, it really is.
I mean, every once in a while, you got to, you know so when the good sheriff picked up that little girl on a solicitation charge and she offered him a freebie to let her go, well, he took her to the most out-of-the-way place he could think of.
problem is... Sheriff likes it rough.
Caroline fought back.
lot of blood when all was said and done.
now, the sheriff cleaned up the best he could, but he forgot one little detail.
the lightbulb.
the same one my baby brother is pointing out to him right this very moment.
Oh, my God, he's going to kill him.
Yeah, we can only hope so.
you've reached the cell phone of Detective Lee Scanlon.
leave a message after the beep.
Lee, this is Allison, this is an emergency.
call me back.
voice mail, huh?
not a good sign.
hope Caroline won't be too upset if the sheriff gets the drop on ol' Lee.
she's obviously rooting for things to go the other way.
of course, I kind of fibbed and told her Lee was quicker on the draw than the guy who killed her.
Ah, what am I saying?
I can't fool you.
you know the rules better than I do.
I'm dead, so I peeked.
I looked into the future and saw how it all ended and let's just say everyone gets what they want, all the dead people anyway.
good idea.
let's go see for ourselves how it all turned out.
wonder which one of us is going to make it there first.
I do believe this is what you call a win-win, partner.
this scumbag pulled his gun while your brother's back was turned.
of course, your brother here saw him in the mirror.
very cool.
sounds like my friend Allison called in the cavalry.
I guess our work here is done.
good.
then I can get gone, and with any luck, I'll never have to run into any of you again.
that's all right, you can thank me later.
huh, well... love you, too, darling.
remember when we were little?
that big hill behind our house?
all the neighborhood kids would play King of the Mountain there.
just about every day, it'd end up with you and me at the top.
just about every day... I'd knock you down to the bottom with the rest of the losers.
remember what I used to tell you?
you may be Mr. Good.
but I'll always be Mr. Better.
so that she can come back here and give me a heads up before it's my turn.
and you can pretend that you don't care about me.
but I care about you and I have taught you lots of things and we have done lots of stuff together, but I plan to do more.
so I wrote this up for you.
it's instructions on how to video-chat with me while I'm in college, because I know that you want to but you're too proud to ask Marie how to do it.
so, anyway, in a few minutes Dad is going to come in here and he's going to wake everybody up and you can go back to pretending that you don't care that I'm going, and that's fine with me.
but I just want you to know that I love you... that you are loved...
and that you will be missed... and there is not a damn thing you can do about it.
see you at parents weekend.
me, too.
I know.
girls, got a big day!
everybody up and at 'em!
Mr. Bill's Safety Tips.
Oh, hey, everybody.
today we're gonna show you some safety tips for around the kitchen.
now first, you should never leave sharp objects lying around.
you're right, Mr. Bill.
I'm gonna put this away right now.
good idea, Allison.
no, wait! No!
you know, things don't have to be sharp to be unsafe.
like plastic bags.
you can suffocate in one of these.
say, Mr. Bill, I couldn't finish lunch.
you should never be wasteful.
that's right, Allison.
it's never good to waste food, but, uh, hey,
I'm in here, and...
no, wait! Don't do that! I can't breathe! No!
and finally, it's important to always turn the handles of your pots inward so you don't knock them over while cooking.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Bill.
I'll take care of that right now.
let's just get you out of the way.
Oh, no, Allison, I'm catching on.
I think you just want to be mean to me.
why, what do you mean, Mr. Bill?
so you just leave me alone right this minute.
Mr. Bill, quit giving me a hard time.
no, wait!
you awake?
the procedure went well.
I was explaining to your husband that, uh your burns were a little more severe than we initially thought.
but the skin graft took without any complications.
thank you.
you're welcome.
now, we've performed what's called an allograft.
that means we've grafted some healthy skin tissue we got from a donor onto your burns.
the healthy skin tissue should promote healing.
you'll feel some itching,
but in about a month you'll be almost as good as new.
I'll be releasing you as soon as the effects of the anesthesia wear off.
but tell me again how it happened.
Oh... It was so stupid.
I-I was cooking dinner.
then the phone rang, and I-I ran to get it, and I bumped my arm into the handle of a pot of boiling water.
that's why you're supposed to turn those.....pot handles in.
okay, so it's really late, so you just get in your bedclothes, okay, and I'll take care of everything in the kitchen.
you okay? - Yeah, babe, I'm okay.
well, Marie already went to bed.
and I cleaned up the kitchen.
that's a lot of bandages.
okay, yow... All right, so Marie's got a play date with, um...
Emily in the morning and Bridgette's got soccer practice at 9: 30.
I just can't get over how they make these team practices... - You okay?
so early on Sundays mornings.
well, she's in middle school now, so it's time for everyone to start taking sports way too seriously.
she's the equipment manager, so if she doesn't bring the cones and the balls and whatever else is cluttering up our garage right now...
it's okay. I'll take her.
it's hard to believe that these skin grafts aren't gonna leave a scar.
I know. It's pretty amazing how an allograft works.
they count on the body's immune system rejecting the donor skin.
that's why there's no scar.
it just has to stay on there long enough to help the body heal.
it's all very efficient.
look at you. You look like a little boy playing with a new train set.
well, okay, I'll admit it.
I knocked over that pot on purpose. I did it for you.
you're the best.
leave your name, your number, and a brief message. Thanks a lot.
Hey, sweetie, it's Monica. I just wanted to tell you that
I wore the necklace you gave me to the hospital today.
got compliments all day long.
everyone said the emerald's beautiful.
I love it, and I love you. Can't wait to see you. Bye.
kinda sounds like a woman named Monica Janeway.
she's a resident at Casa Valley Memorial Hospital.
according to the police report, she was believed to have been forcibly abducted from her apartment about a week ago.
Yeah, I saw the man who took her.
well, you want to meet me over at headquarters?
see if we can generate a sketch?
Lee, it's Sunday. You're supposed to be recuperating.
am I starting something? I don't want to be starting anything.
if you're supposed to be resting... Nah.
she just loves me and that's her way of showing it.
I'm just all bandaged up, but I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, well, me, too.
okay, two hours. I'll see you there.
I'll try and take a look at the case file before you get there.
okay, see you in two hours.
all right, guys, here's your snacks for your team.
gotta get ready. Turn off the TV 'cause you gotta be ready by the time Daddy comes out of the shower.
hey... Okay, have fun.
we'll see you in a couple of hours, okay?
all right. Bye, Dad. - Bye, sweetie.
see you in a few hours. - All right.
excuse me.
are you Bridgette's dad?
Yeah, I'm Joe Dubois. - Josh Whitman.
this is my daughter Hailey. - Hello, Hailey!
this is my youngest, Marie.
so where have you been hiding that Bridgette?
excuse me? - Bridgette. She's quite the phenom.
Oh, really? You think so?
well, Hailey's my youngest.
youngest of three. All my girls played soccer.
in all that time, Bridgette is the first seventh grader
I've ever seen start for the team.
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.
um, Bridgette's the equipment manager, she's not a player.
well, that was Bridgette Dubois that just walked away from your car, right?
she's not just the equipment manager.
she's the starting goalie.
and probably the best player on the team.
Hey, Bridge!
dad?
is something wrong?
uh, no, but are you... are you one of the players?
Yeah, I guess.
you guess?
well, uh... the girl who played before me was goalie, she, uh, she hurt herself, so they put me out there for practice, and, uh...
I guess I was pretty good.
well, don't you have to go drop Marie off at Emily's house?
Yeah, in a minute.
but Bridge, why didn't you tell us that you were on the team?
I don't understand.
your mom and I would love to come watch you play.
well, that's kinda the reason why I didn't tell you.
I mean, I'd get nervous.
there's really a lot of pressure out there already, and some of the parents out there, they take it really, really seriously.
but your mom and I aren't like that.
on the field. We're starting with penalty kicks today.
you're not mad, are you? - No, no, I'm not mad.
I just, I would just, I'd love to watch you play. - Dubois?
it's okay. Yeah. Go. We can't stay today, anyway.
so this is the guy you saw break into her house and Taser her?
you sure? - Positive.
Hmm... I think he's already in the case file.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is him, Doctor Heath Timlin.
now, he's the Chief Surgeon at the Transplant Surgery Center at Casa Memorial-- the same hospital where Monica was a resident.
this is him. This is the man I dreamt about.
Allison, this man, he's one of the top guys in his field, you know?
he's-he's not your, uh... typical kidnapper.
well, does he have an alibi?
where was he the night that she disappeared?
at home. Lives alone.
okay, look, you saw what you saw. I get it.
maybe sometime this week if I have a couple minutes
I'll personally take a second look at Timlin, okay?
I'll track him down.
I'll ask him some questions myself.
but for the meantime, hey, it's Sunday.
what do you say you and I get out of here?
Allison, can I have my arm back, please?
I... I-I can't, I swear to God. I'm not doing that.
I swear to God, I got two eyes.
I can feel it on my arm. You absolutely are doing this. Can you let go?
I can't! It... It's like it doesn't want you to leave.
what the hell was that?
I don't know, I swear to you.
it's like I lost control of my hand.
and the point of this is...?
I don't know. I'm not doing it.
look, what if I said maybe I'll call the doctor today?
I seem to have struck a nerve.
but I swear, I'm as bewildered as you are.
you might want to get that looked at.
make a fist for me. Then release.
hmm, I'm not sure what to say, Mrs. Dubois.
your hand looks just fine to me.
better than fine, given your injury. - Fine?
I lost complete control of this hand this afternoon.
there are tests we can run for that, if you like EMG, nerve conduction but I'm certain that's not your problem.
there's no numbness, no sign of ulnar dysfunction.
you have full range of motion.
even the graft is coming along nicely.
are you, uh, superstitious?
excuse me?
I hope you're not dwelling unduly on where the donated material for your graft might have come from.
what do you mean?
well, we talked about this the night of your procedure.
I know you were in a great deal of pain, but you and your husband both indicated that you understood.
you do recall that your graft came from a deceased person, don't you?
no.
actually, I don't. But... I guess I do now.
I called a cab. I got here as fast as I could.
so what happened?
why didn't the doctor want you to drive yourself home?
it's a long story.
the skin graft came from a dead person. - So?
so... I'm me.
I see dead people. I talk to dead people.
I dream about dead people. - Okay, and?
and this hand and arm are starting to do things of their own accord.
picking up things, touching people, doing all kinds of hand things without me even knowing that they're doing it.
are you saying your hand is possessed?
it's not funny. - It is a little funny.
and what people did you touch?
detective Scanlon. I grabbed his arm.
okay, come on, wipe the smile off your face.
this is frightening.
I mean, it's like my hand has a mind of its own.
I can't drive anymore.
what if this skin came from some kind of suicidal person?
what if it came from a great chef?
what if it wants to steer me into a tree or something?
as opposed to making you simply grab the arms of attractive men in law enforcement?
Allison, I don't know how to participate in this conversation.
I just don't.
I mean, look, the skin on your arm is dead, okay?
now if you don't want to drive, then that's fine.
I can, you know, I can do the driving for the next few days until the graft on your arm falls off, okay?
we'll make it work.
now I need to talk to you about Bridgette.
well, it's not going to happen.
she said she doesn't want us at the game.
she says it's too much pressure.
she doesn't want us there?
why doesn't she want us there?
by the way, when did she get the right to decide?
I kind of understand it. I mean, she's on a streak.
her team's doing great. She doesn't want anything to screw it up.
how are we going to screw it up?
it's not like we're lunatics.
it's not like we're going to paint our faces and curse at the refs.
we just want to see our kid do something she's good at.
well, of course, but if she doesn't want us there...
after I pick up Marie from school tomorrow, I'm going to the game.
what? - There's two games left in the season.
if Bridgette's team wins them both, then they go to the playoffs.
tomorrow's the first game. I'm going to the game. - Joe.
I'm going to wait till the game starts, and then I'm going to sneak in.
she'll never even know I was there.
weren't you the one who just said we're not lunatics?
what the hell's going on, Heath?
what's so important I had to meet you here in the middle of the night?
we have a mutual problem.
thought I'd make you part of the solution.
who is this?
this is problem
morning, Dr Janeway.
night, Dr. Janeway.
what the...?
night, Dr. Janeway.
that doctor the one that I saw take Dr. Janeway you spoke to him?
don't know what to tell you, Allison.
I questioned him for nearly an hour.
there's nothing at all to connect him to Monica Janeway's disappearance.
he has an alibi?
same as before. At home, alone.
listen, it's not a crime to live by yourself.
look, he offered to let us search his home, his office.
he didn't act like he was hiding anything.
that's because he didn't take her to his house or his office.
I think the man that Dr. Timlin met,
I think they were at his place of business.
now if we can find that place, if we can find that man...
welcome to the Lundgren Funeral Home.
the Lundgren Funeral Home is the largest and most modern - funeral home in the area. What's going on?
my staff and I pride ourselves on taking the time to create meaningful, appropriate and personalized funeral services at affordable prices.
my name...
you want to tell me what just happened here?
I think it has to do with this skin graft.
I think whoever I got the skin from must have really loved TV remote controls.
and yes, I know how that sounds.
I'm just going to go back to my desk.
why can't we cheer again?
because, sweetie, we don't want Bridgette to notice us. - Why?
because she said it would make her nervous. - Why?
I... Can we not do this right now, please?
did you see that?
that was your sister. she just did that. Look, look, look, look.
Hey, Daddy, who's that man? - What man?
the one standing with Bridgette. The one telling her what to do.
I don't see any man. - He's right there in the red jacket.
he's definitely telling her what to do.
I know I have to take a bath.
Hey, Marie, honey, why don't you come watch a little TV in the living room.
am I in trouble?
no, not in trouble.
we want to talk to you about your friend in the red jacket.
your soccer friend?
Marie and I went to your game today, and she saw him - standing next to you telling you what to do. - What?
but I told you that I didn't want you to come!
don't be mad at Daddy.
you know what, he was just excited. He was proud of you.
this is not about what I did.
it's about what you did. I didn't do anything wrong.
now is it true?
is there some dead guy helping you in goal?
this is why I didn't want you guys coming.
bridge, hold on now. This is serious.
I don't like the idea of you hanging out with adults that we don't know.
even if they're dead.
and I certainly don't like the idea of you cheating.
I'm not cheating!
I'm not sure if she's actually cheating.
what are you talking about?
look, if there's somebody there that-that nobody else can see but her, and he's telling her what to do, in my mind that's playing with an unfair advantage. It's cheating.
honey, tell us about this man. Who is this man?
he's some old soccer coach, okay?
I met him a few weeks ago, right after our goalie got hurt.
when tryouts came along, he started telling me what to do.
when I made the team, he kind of stuck around.
and he's kind of been coaching me ever since.
coaching you how?
well... He's been telling me where the ball's going and where I have to be to stop it.
all right, well, that sure sounds like cheating to me.
Why? Just because I'm the only person who can see him?
well, there's a lot of other girls on our team who are taller than me.
and they can kick a ball farther than I can.
and nobody calls that cheating.
and then there's girls that are faster than me. But that's fine.
so why is it that the one thing that I can do, that maybe other people can't, that thing is called cheating?
I know you want me to agree with you, but I don't think it's as simple as all that.
as all what? It's unfair. It's cheating.
well, no, she's just using what she's got, just like every other girl on that team.
what? - And you know, she is part of that team.
she's not just carrying equipment.
and she's got friends. People like her.
I'm not sure you want to ruin all that.
ow, that's too tight. - Okay, you know what, this is nuts.
look, I-I don't care what your hand did today,
I'm not restraining it while you've got grafts that are still healing.
what?
so I'm supposed to just let my hand do whatever it wants? - I don't know.
well, fine.
you should've seen that doctor talking to Devalos today.
so smug.
I know that he kidnapped that woman.
I know he had a partner.
I just can't prove it. I can't even prove this second man exists.
what, are we not speaking?
no, we're speaking. I just, I just don't have anything to add.
except, do you know how many sentences you begin with the words "I know"?
I know he had a partner.
I know he kidnapped that woman.
I know taking instructions from a dead soccer coach isn't cheating.
what's it like knowing everything?
Oh, what? What?
what do you want?
you like TV.
the Lundgren Funeral Home is the largest and most modern funeral home in the area.
my staff and I pride ourselves on taking the time to create meaningful...
is this where you had your funeral or something?
...and personalized funeral services at affordable prices.
my name is Wayne Lundgren.
who is this?
good work, hand.
no, I've never seen this girl before.
you say she's gone missing?
it's terrible.
my condolences to her family.
but, uh, I still don't understand what brings you here.
just following up on a lead.
ever met a surgeon named Heath Timlin?
Dr. Timlin? Of course.
his mother died last year, I arranged the funeral service for her.
is he connected to that girl in some way?
well, they work together at Casa Valley Memorial Hospital.
well, like I said, I've never met her. Forgive me,
I've got two different viewings going on right now.
uh, you're more than welcome to take a look around, - but please do remember there are people in mourning here. - Okay.
he's lying. He knows Dr. Timlin's... - Allison, could you not?
Hey, I'll bet you this is the building
I saw Dr. Timlin drive his car into in my dream.
I think this is where he brought Monica Janeway.
okay, but stop pointing. - What?
nobody home?
nobody with anything to say.
okay.
so who are you, now? - Excuse me.
what in the name of God are you doing to my husband?
I am so sorry.
who are you? What are you doing here?
do you work here?
get your hand out of that casket.
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna have to ask both of you to leave now. Now.
I please... - Now.
I'm so sorry. My condolences. - Mine, too.
that's okay, Bridgette. Good effort.
why don't you sub out, get yourself some water.
we don't want to tire you out before the big game tomorrow.
good job. Let's hustle.
come off the line and stay square to the ball.
how many times do I have to say it?
you think you're gonna get this team into the playoffs tomorrow if you can't even remember the fundamentals?
I'm sorry, Coach Swanson.
"sorry" doesn't win championships, Bridgette.
focus does. And hard work.
and listening to the people who are here to help you succeed.
like me.
I don't know.
I'm not so sure about that.
my dad thinks what we're doing is cheating.
what are you talking about?
how can coaching be cheating?
I'm just doing what I've done all my life helping kids like you do your best.
Yeah, it's just, I know a lot of people like you, and... I know that they can see a lot from where they are.
I guess I was just thinking that if, you know, you could see where all the shots are gonna go...
look, you don't want me here...
I will happily find some other athlete who needs my help.
but I want you to be clear about something, young lady.
I am not a cheater.
and you are not a cheater.
now, I don't know where you're getting your information, but I cannot see where the ball is going to go.
what I can do is what I could always do: study the opposition, learn their habits, identify their weaknesses, and then share those things with my players.
now, if that's not something you're interested in, that's fine.
just say the word, I'll be on my way.
you think about it.
just keep in mind, I won't be the only one you'll be disappointing.
this is you, right? That's you doing that?
Yes, this is me.
and so is this.
and this. And this.
that's uncalled for. I'm just trying to help.
you're the one who tried to take the pants off a corpse today.
Oh, thank you very much.
so you gonna see him again?
why, you jealous?
touch - I still have one good hand left.
thank God for that.
better to kiss you with.
let's get her on the table.
what the hell is going on? Who is this woman?
she's a resident at the hospital.
I'm afraid she's figured out what we've been up to.
what? How?
everyone in the surgical department knows
I'm in charge of the tissue bank where the hospital gets most of its skin and bone.
she noticed that some of the bone they'd acquired from me had cancerous cells in it.
now, there's no way someone with cancer is gonna make it through the normal organ donation protocols.
she figured something was up.
she was gonna report it.
she came to me as a courtesy.
thought there'd been some kind of oversight.
you told me that this was all untraceable.
these people we're cutting up are not donors.
I faked the paperwork on all the tissue that comes out of this place.
how else am I gonna sell it?
so, yeah, Wayne, we're untraceable.
as long as nobody conducts a probe into my tissue bank, as long as you don't sell me any more bone from a guy with stage three cancer.
what are you gonna do to her?
get rid of her, of course.
we're gonna get rid of her.
go fire up your crematorium.
soon as I'm done with Dr. Janeway, we can burn up what's left of her.
what's left of her?
don't be so queasy.
this girl's tissue is gonna bring us a lot of money.
if you were sick, wouldn't you want the bone of a healthy young woman?
wouldn't you love just a... just a little bit of that flawless skin?
Oh, my God. Monica, is that you?
I'm sorry... you believe you've been walking around - with a piece of Monica Janeway's skin? - Yes.
that transplant surgeon, Dr. Timlin, he owns a tissue bank.
he sells bone and skin to hospitals all over the Southwest.
he pays Wayne Lundgren to take tissue from the corpses at his funeral home...
from people who aren't even organ donors.
then Timlin fakes the donation paperwork and sells the organs on the open market.
it's quite a story.
well, it gets better than that.
when Monica Janeway figured out what he was doing,
Timlin murdered her, then cut her up for parts.
I wound up with a piece of her skin on my arm.
wait a second, Allison. The guy's a transplant surgeon.
he's got to be making in the high six figures.
why would he be sneaking around dissecting people?
what, rich people don't want to be richer?
come on, the guy's been divorced three times.
that's a lot of alimony.
look, I'm telling you, I have Dr. Janeway's skin on my arm.
if we can prove that my skin graft matches her DNA, and we can get the hospital to verify that this skin came from Dr. Timlin's tissue bank...
then the doctor would have to explain how he came to sell the skin of a missing woman.
got it. I'll run the test right away.
in the meantime, make sure you have some officers following both the funeral home owner and Dr. Timlin.
if the skin on Allison's arm matches Monica Janeway's DNA,
I'll want them both picked up right away.
it'll match.
it's her skin.
so what do you think, Coach Swanson?
how much are we gonna win this one by?
open your eyes, Dubois.
this team you're playing today? They are a formidable force.
talk to me, Coach.
that ball gonna make it here?
left side? Right side? Come on. What's your instinct?
coach?
coach, a little help?
coach D. Swanson"?
that's the half!
it's okay, ladies. It's just one half.
we have 30 more minutes to make a game of it.
let's go! Let's hustle!
Hey, you okay, Bridge?
you seem a little... off today.
Yeah, it's just, I think I might have hurt my knee.
maybe I should sit out the rest of the game. - Really?
you're in that much pain?
why don't you try walking it off?
see how you feel in ten minutes.
Hey, Dubois... how you holding up?
how am I holding up?
not so good.
I can't believe that you gave me that whole entire lecture yesterday about cheating.
you! The biggest cheater of all time.
why you say that?
just cause I didn't help you for part of a game?
come on. I saw the sign.
I get it now. That's your team.
and this is your field.
and the only reason you helped me out in the first place is because you wanted to play a team that you knew you could beat so that you'd be certain to go to the championships.
well, wait a second.
and the reason you accepted my help?
wasn't it because you thought it would make you a winner?
wasn't it because you liked being popular?
liked having friends?
how is that not cheating?
did you practice more than everyone else?
did you spend every moment after school honing your moves?
changing your diet?
exercising to improve your body?
no, you did not.
you let someone else tell you what to do, and then you took the credit for it.
talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
Bridgette Dubois, you are a lazy little girl who wants to be on a winning team, but has no interest in doing any of the work to make it happen.
you're as phony as that limp you used getting over here.
my old team is going to destroy you.
or destroy whoever it is they end up putting in to take your place.
now limp on back to your bench and stop acting like you've been wronged.
you're going to get out of this thing exactly what you've put into it... nothing.
Dubois, come on!
let's take a look at that knee and figure out what we're doing for the second half!
I'll be right there.
thanks for giving me the last word.
Bridgette Dubois, you are a lazy little girl who wants to be on a winning team, but has no interest in doing any of the work to make it happen.
you're as phony as that limp you used getting over here.
so how's that knee?
it's great. I'm great.
I'm hungry!
the pasta'll be ready in a few minutes.
hopefully, your sister will be here by then.
Hello?
ask me how we did.
how did you do?
they killed us eight to two.
Oh, no!
now ask me how I did?
okay. How'd you do?
I never played so hard in my life.
it was great. It was awful. But it was great.
I made a ton of mistakes, but I put everything I had into it.
and I actually got something out of it.
mistakes? I'm confused.
I didn't think your friend the ghost let you make mistakes.
Yeah, well, he decided not to show up today.
for me, anyways.
and I'm glad.
and by the way, next season?
I'd love for you guys to come to my games.
you, too, Marie.
Hello?
Allison, it's Manuel.
I thought you'd want to know that we have the preliminary results back from the DNA test we ran on your skin graft this morning.
I'm sorry, but we're not getting a match for Monica Janeway's DNA.
what?
apparently ever since the graft was applied to your arm, it's been mingling with your own skin, and that's made it impossible to obtain any sort of usable DNA sample from the tissue.
I'm sorry, but I thought you'd want to know.
no, no, it's okay.
thanks for calling.
we're gonna have to be careful with this one, Doc.
right. Of course. Got a long life ahead of him, this one.
no, you don't understand. We're not cremating this one.
the family wants an open casket, and the viewing is tomorrow.
so if you take too much tissue from him, they'll notice.
relax, Wayne.
I'm only gonna take skin and bone from below the waist.
no one's gonna be any the wiser.
we reached out to the family of the man you dreamt about.
his name was Norman Kent.
when we told his widow that we suspected her late husband had been a victim of Lundgren and Timlin's scheme, she gave us permission to exhume his corpse.
no sooner had the medical examiner removed
Mr. Kent's pants than she discovered a significant amount of skin tissue was missing.
in addition, the bones of his hips and legs had been replaced with common PVC piping.
we confronted Lundgren with the evidence, and he copped to the scam right away.
we're picking up Dr. Timlin as we speak. - Well, good.
so they're both under arrest or they will be.
well, they're both under arrest for conspiring to sell organs.
but Lundgren didn't admit to killing Monica Janeway.
and there's still nothing concrete tying her to either man.
I don't understand.
they're just gonna get away with chopping her to pieces?
they'll each do jail time for their role in the organ scam.
but at this point, it's a very real possibility that they'll never be held accountable for the murder of Dr. Janeway.
Monica, what are you doing?
why don't you want me to leave?
what? Is something wrong?
why are you staring at me? - I don't know.
I-I work for the District Attorney's office.
um, ma'am, do mind me asking you what you're doing here?
I'm waiting for my husband, Wayne Lundgren.
he said the police had a few questions for him.
what are you doing?
my husband gave me that necklace. Give that back to me!
I am so sorry. I don't even know why I just did that.
give me that back!
my husband gave that to me.
well, it wasn't your husband's to give.
it belongs to a woman named Monica Janeway.
a woman that your husband helped murder.
what are you talking about? My Wayne? - Yes, your Wayne.
he took it off her neck right after he helped slit her throat.
I'm hoping that there's some microscopic specks of blood on it blood that will help us put your husband and his partner on death row.
right, Monica?
do I know you?
well, no... Actually, we've never met.
but I'm very close with Monica Janeway.
and she wanted me to tell you how very much she's looking forward to seeing you again.
what the...?
it's motor oil.
that's right. it's Motor oil.
and this is a lighter.
look, I know what you did, I know what you took, so give it to me.
how do you know that, space man?
nobody knows about that.
now, get your ass out of here.
if it's in here and you're not telling me, then it's gonna burn up along with you.
but if it's in here and you give it to me, maybe we can work something out.
Hey, man, it's not in here.
then where is it?
where is it?! - Stand up, will you?!
put that thing out!
it's with my partner.
and where's he?
he's got a trailer like this in the desert.
30 miles east of Kingman!
30 miles east of Kingman.
Hey, white boy, who in the hell are you?
the man who can read your mind.
Hey! Hey!
stop!
Hey! Stop!
30 miles east of Kingman.
you say something?
what?
I asked, "Did you say something"?
you're talking gibberish.
what?
I'm talking gibberish?
stop that. Talk to me.
I am talking to you.
and you're talking to me.
what is that? Are you making that up?
is that a language?
Oh, man.
not today.
hey
daddy?
I got to take your mom to the hospital, have someone take a look at her.
it's almost 6: 00.
when it's time, get your sister up and help her with breakfast.
I don't know how I'm gonna get you to school today, but I'll call you from the hospital once I figure it out.
everybody on TV is talking gibberish, too.
okay?
don't lecture me.
I-I know exactly where I'm supposed to be.
I'm not happy about not being at that breakfast in New York, but my wife is in the hospital.
that's nice of you.
if I knew what kind of specialist she needed,
I'd absolutely take you up on that and I'd be making that call.
Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.
okay, thanks.
Mr. Dubois?
Yes.
Hi. I'm Dr. Natalie Salem.
I've been looking at your wife.
is this a good time to talk?
Yes, yes, absolutely.
please. - Okay.
there we go.
she's fine, by the way.
resting very comfortably. - Good. She's fine?
well, she's sedated.
but, really, she's fine.
I mean, there is nothing physiologically wrong with her.
everything works, she can hear, she just doesn't recognize what she hears as speech.
at least as speech in a language she's familiar with.
okay. - But she was able to read questions - that I typed on the computer and then speak back to me. - Okay.
really, she's fine.
it's a kind of hysteria, like hysterical blindness, where a person can see, but they don't believe they can see.
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.
based on what I read in her file, you've been through a lot of these things.
God...
I don't know how you do it.
uh, what now?
there's really no actual way of treating this.
that's why I sedated her. I'm hoping when she wakes up, the condition will have reversed itself.
she's gonna be out for a couple more hours at least, if you want to do something.
I, um, I have your number, so I can call you when she's awake.
okay, that'd be great.
and here's my number.
you never know when you might need it.
it was nice meeting you, Joe.
Hello?
is anybody home?
Hi, you.
last I remember, you were driving me to the hospital in the dark.
how did we get here?
it's amnesia. They said that might happen cause of the sedative.
uh, we've been home couple hours now.
you can't understand a word I'm saying, can you?
I don't understand a word you're saying.
my e-mail?
you sent me an e-mail?
amnesia.
Oh, I'm sorry you missed work.
Oh, good, you got the girls to school.
doctor said it will reverse itself in time.
hysteria? You don't think it's hysteria, do you?
um, I got to go pick up the girls.
school. I get it.
do you want the paper?
newspaper?
Oh, newspaper.
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.
okay.
there you go. - Thanks.
love you!
Hey, what are you doing?
go say hi to your mom before you get something to eat.
come on, Marie.
hello.
this is Joe.
Mr. Burroughs? Yeah, okay, put him on.
dad, Mom's not here.
mom's not anywhere.
actually, can I call him right back?
it's a pretty wild story.
that is quite a story.
guy in a fireproof suit, motor oil.
I think you're gonna have to get the coroner to go back out there and take a second look.
forensics, arson guys...
okay.
forensics...
you sent me an e-mail?
I-I can't understand what you're saying. - Now, I come home, I got the kids,
I got my boss on the phone, you're nowhere to be found, and finally I realize you sent me an e-mail.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Oh, right. Okay, there it is.
right above the e-mail about foreclosure bargains in my neighborhood;
right below the one about how I can save big on life-extending vitamins.
Joe, you're upset. I can see that.
but I know you read the e-mail I sent about going to see my boss, - so I'm lost here. I don't know... - I think the well is empty.
I think the reservoir of love and goodwill and benefit of the doubt is dry.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.
I wake up every morning with a different Allison.
and somehow, I'm supposed to adjust.
my job, the kids-- somehow we're all supposed to adjust.
I'm just tired.
I'm just tired of it, Allison.
I don't know what it is.
whatever it is, I'm sorry.
I'll fix it. When this is over, I will fix it.
hello.
just a second, just a second.
sorry. Honey? Honey?
I need your help. It's my boss. Can you talk to him?
evening, District Attorney, it's Joe.
no, it's okay. You tell me, I'll tell her.
okay, I got it.
you... were... right.
it... was... our... son.
it was...
murder.
are you still mad at me?
she's been sitting there like that all day.
well, I don't know what else to do.
I sent her three emails telling her it's okay if she goes home.
but she insists this is where she wants to be.
it's not going to happen.
they don't seem to want my help.
of course I explained to them who I was, I'm trying to tell you.
they kept me waiting for over an hour, then they told me they weren't interested.
I told you, this was a bad idea.
anyway...
I'm coming home.
Ichi bara wu?
Ichi bara wu.
you know, I'm sorry, I know I'm staring. It's just...
I understood every word you just said on the phone.
except for, uh, that... "Ichi bara wu."
you understood everything I was saying on the phone?
Yeah. And I just understood what you just said about me understanding.
it's the language I'm speaking to you right now.
it's the language I was speaking on the phone.
it's Navajo, it's the Navajo language.
Oh, no... I mean...
well, I don't think so.
and you're answering me in English.
forgive me. My name's Jane Livingston.
I'm a professor of anthrolinguistics at Mesa University.
no, no, no, please, forgive me.
my name is Allison DuBois. I work here, and the only language that I speak is English.
at least, up until yesterday morning, when suddenly I couldn't understand anything that anybody said.
up until now. Up until you.
I saw the story this morning on the news, and I thought, My God, a murder!
I thought... maybe I could be of some help to this investigation, speaking the language and all?
but nobody here was interested.
well, I'm interested.
I'm going to talk to my boss, I'm going to get you involved.
you know, I've heard of people like you.
suddenly being able to understand a language they've never been exposed to.
it's called xenoglossia.
great. So it has a name?
even now, as we're speaking, you have no awareness
no. It sounds like you're speaking English.
I mean, it sounds great. Like a relief.
frankly, it's been almost two days, and my husband and my daughters...
they're having a hard time with the whole thing.
well, then...
I guess maybe it was meant to be that we meet each other today.
I'm only teaching one class this semester.
so if you need any help, a translator or someone to speak to your family on the phone...
Oh no, I couldn't do that.
sure you could.
and we are going to work together.
you are going to get me involved. Right?
I have devoted my adult life to studying this beautiful language.
and these beautiful people, I want to help.
really, I do.
Thanks.
so. Have you told her yet?
Nope. Not yet.
told her what?
none of your business, just eat.
your sister chose not to go to gym all last week, so now she has to stay late for detention all this week.
wow, you are bad.
and Mom doesn't even know!
how is she supposed to know?
she can't understand a word you tell her.
it's like talking to a dog.
Hey. - What?
Hello?
Yes, Mr. District Attorney, she's here.
h-hold on one second. Let me go into another room so I can write down everything for her.
how much will you give me?
for what?
you can't tell her anything. She can't hear.
I'll write her a note.
girls, what are you talking about?
Aw. I love you, too, babe. I love both you girls.
you go for the pencil, I'll break your hand.
give me $5. 00.
three. - Deal.
your boss needs you to go to this address.
was that Devalos?
Hey, Dad. You got three singles?
uh, hello, whoever you are, I can't talk now.
Oh, yes you can, you can talk to me. I speak your language.
Jane! Dr. Livingston.
what are you doing?
Oh, I'm heading out to a murder scene.
out in the desert, about 30 miles east of Kingman.
that's just off the reservation.
a lot of Navajo live out there.
was the person who was murdered a Navajo?
I don't know.
you want company?
you won't be able to understand anyone if I'm not there, right?
I'm at the university. Come by and pick me up.
it's weird.
guy was beat to a pulp, then shot in the knee, the shoulder, the cheek, and then got in the ankle.
all at close range.
okay.
now what does that tell us?
shooter couldn't make up his mind?
Whew.
Hey, guys.
this is Dr. Jane Livingston.
from Mesa University.
she's a linguist, and she knows an awful lot about the Navajos that live in this area.
believe it or not, if there's anything you want to say to me, she can translate it into a language that I can understand.
it's nice to meet you.
nice to meet you.
nice to meet you both.
is that him?
Yeah.
if you'd like me to take a look, I might be able to identify him.
I spend a lot of time with these people.
I might know him.
well, we think we already have a lead on who the guy is.
but, uh, if you really want to...
it's okay.
it's okay, come on.
let's get some fresh air.
on second thought, maybe that wasn't such a good idea.
the detective was saying that they believe this man and the man who was burned to death knew each other.
used to work on the same construction crew.
and they found this rifle hidden under the trailer.
they're not sure if it's even connected to the murder.
come on!
come on!
come on!
they robbed a bank.
they worked together.
they were a team.
they robbed the Deming First National Bank.
did she do what I think she just did?
it's what she does.
you all right?
I don't know.
I guess.
I've never seen anyone like that before.
a bullet in the head.
dead.
I tried to warn you.
Oh, I know.
I'm sure he lived a violent life.
it's just...
Navaho's a dying language.
even the kids growing up on the reservations, so few of them speak it these days.
and now two more men who did are gone.
that makes me sad.
that's ridiculous, right?
no.
it's kind of tragic, actually.
hello.
Yes, she's here.
it's for you.
hello.
am I taking you away from something?
Hi, Jane.
I am calling in my new and unofficial capacity as aide to Allison Dubois.
the district attorney phoned me.
asked me if I could pass on some new info to you.
said he would have e-mailed it, but he wasn't near a computer.
well, cool.
I have an aide.
I like that.
that gun they found buried beneath the trailer -
turns out it was used in the bank robbery in Deming, New Mexico, last week.
a masked man came in with an assault rifle and fired a warning shot into the ceiling.
walked away with a little over a million dollars.
Oh, wow.
also, and he said this would probably only make sense to you:
guess now we know what the man in the fire suit was looking for in the trailer.
Yeah, I guess we do.
and that's all she wrote.
so, listen...
I know that this is hard for you.
isolating and frustrating
but for what it's worth, even with all the blood and gore, this has been a kick.
I never in a million years imagined I'd meet someone like you.
and never in a million years did I imagine I'd meet you the way I did.
so... thanks.
you know, this isn't over.
Oh, I don't know, I'm thinking it's kind of close.
I don't know why I'd say that.
you're the psychic, not me.
I guess it's a feeling I have.
and I wanted to say that to you, because I like you, Allison.
Oh, I like you, too.
all right, enough of that.
you get back to your family.
I'm getting back to my books.
this is your aide signing off.
Hi. This is Dr. Natalie Salem.
if you're calling with a medical emergency please hang up and dial 911.
if you need to speak with me personally, please leave a detained message...
you okay?
everybody's tucked in.
who was on the phone?
I was just checking my voice mail at work.
just a work call.
it's... it's nothing.
it doesn't matter.
Hey, don't say anything.
I mean, you know, I really wouldn't be able to understand what you said if you did.
so...
just listen.
I think all this is almost over
I do. And Jane called earlier, and she thinks it's almost over.
those two guys are dead.
we know what happened.
we know why.
and that's why I think it's almost over.
so who knows, I could wake up in the morning and suddenly understand everything everyone's saying to me.
I could wake up in the morning and we could talk.
cause I sense that we really need to do that.
anyway, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.
I've got a squad car heading over to her home now.
as soon as they make contact with her, we can figure out if we actually need to send a protective detail over there.
beyond that...
I keep calling and getting no answer.
Allison, it's not even 7: 00 in the morning.
maybe she's a sound sleeper.
maybe she's in the shower.
this-- bludgeoning by tiki totem -
frankly there's something off about the whole thing.
it doesn't sound like something that's happening here, now.
she's a college professor.
and she really has nothing to do with any of the things we're investigating, save for the fact that she's a translator for you.
I can't help but think that you're letting your imagination get the best of you.
in any event, once we've made contact with her, I will contact you.
why don't you go home.
have breakfast with your family.
you'll call me as soon as you make contact?
Yes, I will call you.
thank you.
okay, the two of you, kiss your mother good-bye.
see you after school, Mom.
see you after school, Mom.
have a good day, Chicklets.
okay, see you after school, Mom.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
can you tell me what she's saying?
it's a recorded message.
it's a voice mail greeting.
it's nothing.
is she saying something about being sick or being out of town?
no, just "Leave your name and number.
no.
got to get the girls to school.
school-- I got it.
see you later.
love you, too.
Hi, this is Jane.
I'm not here right now, so please leave a message and I'll call you back.
Hey, uh, Jane, hi.
this is Allison.
listen, I'm worried about you. I had an awful dream.
this man that I've never seen before, he was-- he was blond.
you were getting out of the shower.
He-he-- I think he killed you.
he hit you with this tiki thing.
it was-- it was all very Polynesian.
I don't know-- I mean...
it's so crazy.
I don't know, maybe I'm going crazy.
can you just call me, please?
Hi. This is Jane.
I'm not here right now so please leave a message...
Hi, this is Jane.
I'm not...
welcome back.
everybody at the bar says to say good night.
turns out, that threesome you were so excited about isn't gonna work out.
you drugged me.
you put something in my drink.
I just sensed you weren't gonna bring me back here and tell me what I needed to know on your own.
was I off base?
so...
Where's the money?
what money?
the money you and your friend were bragging about grabbing from that bank the other night.
when you two were getting trashed at Colby's bar.
you know, you really ought to watch what you say, cause you never know who might be listening.
wait a second.
you speak Navajo?
and five other fairly useless languages.
so I'm never gonna make a million dollars, unless I take it from you.
so tell me where it is.
and you don't even have to do it in English.
I'm willing to work for my money.
you think I'm kidding?
how about I shoot you in the ankle?
how'd that be for a conversation starter?
Yeah, you were laughing your pants off about your little bank robbery the other night, but you're not laughing now, are you?
what?
you figured you were in some college bar with a bunch of palefaces who wouldn't understand a word you were saying?
that was a big mistake, Tonto.
because my friend and I were sitting right there, and we understood just about everything.
so what do you say we stop making mistakes?
tell me where the money is and maybe I won't kill you.
okay.
you got nothing to say?
how about we up the ante?
how about I shoot you in your knee?
I'm gonna count to three.
one...
two...
three.
hello.
I-I can't understand you, but I can recognize your voice.
Lee, I can't understand you.
listen, you know that man that I saw murder Jane, the blond man?
he killed both those Navajo bank robbers.
Lee, what are you saying?
is this about Jane?
is-is this about Jane?
just text me.
text me.
I'm at her house. She is gone.
are you coming to bed?
are you coming to bed?
I'm going to bed.
this is a real bonanza for you, isn't it?
this is just a great cover.
and then you could totally opt out of everything and, "hell, the little woman wouldn't understand a word I was saying anyway."
what do you want from me?
sorry, no comprende.
you do understand that I'm worried sick about my friend, right?
she's just gone.
she's apparently the victim of some kind of foul play.
do you even care that I'm upset?
that I'm worried?
because you're making absolutely no effort to even try to communicate.
and it's just killing me.
don't cry it's hard being married to someone who sees things i can't. I know.
and sometimes i fell sorry for myself i'm not pround of it . it's okay.
I love you . you'd better.
what are you doing?
no. Hey, you can't get in here.
nobody invited you in.
I'm not impressed.
well, okay, maybe I'm a little impressed.
shut up. I love you, too.
that was unbelievable!
it was better than getting tenure, that was...
Oh, my God, what a rush!
what a rush, what a rush!
boom!
can you feel the heat?
I can still feel the heat.
why are you looking at me like that?
say something.
did he tell you where the money is?
Oh, my God.
she was in on it.
who was in on what?
what?
say that again.
what? What? Why?
did you actually understand what I just said?
Yes.
Yes! I understand everything now.
hello.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone there?
is there anyone there?
I don't hear you looking for someone to translate.
someone must be able to understand English again.
Jane, where are you?
me? Let's just call it paradise.
beautiful, tropical, non-English-speaking paradise.
Jane, I know what you did.
I know that you and the man who murdered those bank robbers were in it together, and I told the authorities everything I know.
I wouldn't have expected you to do otherwise.
by the way, I checked my messages.
your calls meant a lot to me.
especially your premonition about my untimely passing.
soon as I checked into the house I rented,
I saw the Polynesian decor and the tiki on the dresser, and I knew exactly what was going to happen.
my greedy boyfriend wanted all the money to himself.
the good news is, thanks to you, I was ready for him.
I know you'll be relieved to know he's out of the picture now.
you murdered him?
I defended myself.
you helped me defend myself.
actually, I'll miss him.
but at least I'll have over a million dollars to keep me company.
combien?
Jane, listen to me.
there's something I need to say to you, and I need to make sure that you understand.
I hate you, Jane Livingston.
and we will find you, and we will punish you.
Oh, Allison, don't be that way.
times are tough, and there just aren't enough lucrative opportunities for anthrolinguists these days.
and teaching just doesn't pay what it should.
on the other hand, crime totally pays.
you can't run forever.
actually, I can.
it's a shame we won't be able to stay in touch.
she used me.
I trusted her and she used me.
I pretty much gave her an all-access pass to our investigation.
some psychic.
she fooled us all, Allison.
just a fact of life.
sometimes we don't get to catch the bad guy.
at least not right away.
she'll want to come home-- they always do
and when she does, we'll get her.
you know my boyfriend's gonna be back any minute.
Oh, really?
the one you took care of?
you should watch what you say.
you never know who might be listening.
what are you doing?
don't do that. We can do a job together.
I'll cut you in.
I don't think so.
please, no.
don't.
you okay?
bad dream?
no, no, no. No, not this time.
okay, folks... show is over!
it's time for Elvis to leave the building.
it's a long way down, friend.
who are you?
where the hell did you come from?
that doesn't matter.
what matters is you.
do you understand you are about to embark on a course of action from which there is no turning back?
Oh, such a waste!
you're so young, so filled with promise.
promise?
in the last two weeks, I've lost my job,
I lost my apartment, lost a fight...
so if it's promise that you're looking for...
I think you may have me confused with someone else.
I can help you.
I can show you how to turn your life around.
how'd you do that?
weren't you just over there?
and how'd you know my name?
I know everything.
I can see everything.
come on, Michael, say yes.
say yes to me.
say yes to success.
yes to success.
if it was only that easy.
but it is.
come on!
look at yourself.
what have you got to lose?
sure.
Absolutely!
Yes!
yes to suc...
everything okay? - Yeah.
just had a horrible dream.
my brother Michael.
I'm worried; I think he might be in trouble.
you needed a dream to tell you that?
come on...
yo. - Yo.
is that you? Is this Michael?
I don't know.
who is this?
it's your sister Allison.
Hey, Al! That is so weird.
I was just going to call you.
after I landed.
landed?
are you traveling somewhere?
Yeah, for work.
in fact, I'm going to Phoenix.
that's why I was going to call you.
you sound good. You sound happy.
did you say work?
Yeah, work.
and I am good.
I... I'm happy.
I have a great new job, a great new life.
so you're not... depressed or anything?
no. Why? Should I be?
now boarding Flight 72404...
Hey, sorry, Al, uh, my plane's taking off.
I'm gonna have to run.
Hey, when am I going to see you?
what are you doing for dinner tonight? I don't know.
what are you doing for dinner tonight?
well, come by the house-- around 7: 00.
all right, you got it.
okay, fly safe.
Hey. Hey, sorry I'm late.
uh, I rushed over as soon as Devalos called.
Oh, my God.
ask me if we have a cause of death.
okay. Do we have a cause of death?
Oh, yeah. Several.
broken neck, broken back, punctured lung, and two or three others I can't think of off the top of my head.
and all accomplished without the use of a weapon.
you mean somebody did this with their bare hands?
that's what the folks at the medical examiner's are telling me, so obviously we're looking for a very big boy.
his name was Warren Cheswick.
none of his valuables are missing, no signs of forced entry.
neighbors said he's an absolute peach.
what a horrible way to die. - Yeah.
ordinarily, I wouldn't pull you in so early;
it's just with these new Charlie Dalton For Mayor ads that started running on TV last night...
what are you talking about? What ads?
you haven't seen 'em? Oh, you'll love 'em.
according to these ads, Manny's soft on crime.
just a big bleeding heart wearing a fancy suit.
needless to say, the sooner we catch the guy who did this, and turn him over to Manny, the better.
you know I'm happy to try, but I'm not very good at this.
I mean, whenever I go looking for clues, I almost never find any.
I just... you know, I'm not a Geiger counter.
Yes, ma'am.
sorry I'm not a Geiger counter.
find some uranium?
the man that we, we just found murdered in this room,
I-I-I, I just saw him taking pictures of a girl that he had... he had bound and gagged.
she was... she was dying, he kept taking pictures of her, and then he, he hid the camera in that book over there.
there.
he's got pictures of at least three other girls in here.
I guess Warren Cheswick wasn't such a peach after all.
manuel Devalos says he's the law and order candidate.
but let's look at the facts.
homicides in Phoenix are up 12% over the last four years.
gun violence is up 14%.
does that sound like law and order to you?
Charlie Dalton for Mayor.
real law.
real order.
I don't know.
sounds kind of desperate, if you ask me.
Mr. District Attorney...
Charlie Dalton has been a councilman for... half a term.
he's got no record to speak of, so he's attacking mine.
people see through this kind of thing.
look, Manny, you know the numbers aren't encouraging.
we're down.
and this gap is only going to get bigger once this ad goes into heavy rotation.
we need to hit back.
we have to hit back.
I told you when I hired you, Justine,
I won't indulge in negative campaigning.
I know, which is why, up until now, we have run a very polite campaign.
a very polite, ineffective campaign.
can I ask you something?
as long as you're polite about it.
Allison DuBois -- why aren't we using her?
what do you mean, "using her" ? using her how?
well, for starters, we could give her everything we have on Charlie Dalton and see what she comes up with.
who knows? Maybe she'll dream about something that we can use against him.
absolutely not.
I like that.
speaking without thinking.
very desirable in a public official.
look... with all due respect, Mr. District Attorney, what is your problem with winning?
I don't have a problem with winning, Ms. Godrich.
I do have a problem with compromising friends and colleagues.
Allison DuBois is an employee of this city, not my campaign.
so how about we stop wasting time and energy figuring out how we can stoop to Charlie Dalton's level, and see what we can do to focus the voters on the issues that actually matter in this election?
Yes, sir.
no Allison DuBois.
change the focus. - Thank you.
200 envelopes, Ms. Godrich.
stuffed and ready to go.
would you like me to take these to the mail room?
no.
uh, you've been working on the campaign for a while now, huh, Bridgette?
about three weeks. Why do you ask?
eh, well, I was just thinking that maybe, uh, maybe a little promotion was in order.
look at you!
Oh, look at you, look at you, look at you.
give me a hug, already.
wow, nice suit! What'd you do, mug an undertaker?
Yeah, I know I'm a little overdressed, but I came here right from work 'cause I didn't want to be late.
I'm sorry, you came from where?
Yeah, I know. I know.
come in! - Thanks.
if you'd told me a year ago I'd be working as a pharmaceutical rep,
I would've laughed in your face.
I mean, if you'd told me a year ago I'd be working at all,
I would've laughed.
so what is it you actually do?
well, basically, I sell drugs to doctors.
are you a drug dealer?
well, kind of, but...the kind of drugs I sell are the kind you take when you're sick and trying to get better.
so how'd you hear about this job?
did you see an ad in the paper?
heard about it through a friend.
a friend? Who?
it's past 9: 00. - Ah, busted.
all right. Come on, girls.
say good night to your uncle Michael.
girls, I'll check in on you.
good night, sweetie.
love you, sweetheart.
all right, quit staring at me.
I'm sorry, I'll... I'll try.
I just been worried about you.
I dreamt about you.
that's never good.
you were pretty messed up.
you were standing on this bridge.
Yeah, well... I've stood on a few bridges in my time, but don't worry, I'm not that guy anymore.
in my dream, this guy showed up.
he talked you out of it.
is he the one?
is he the one who told you about this job, who helped you straighten up?
Hey, look.
the Best You You Can Be.
Yeah, turn it over.
do you recognize him?
I sure do.
Hey, thanks for helping my brother.
Yeah, he'd written, like, 15 books before he died.
he's helped thousands of people, and now he just helps me.
still? - Every day.
mom!
all right. Looks like you're needed.
I'll, um, go and say good night with you and then head back to the hotel.
hotel? Aren't you staying on the couch?
no. Like I said, I'm... I'm not that guy anymore.
but I got an extra key, so if the kids want to come use the pool after school tomorrow.
let me get this straight.
your little brother's got himself a dead life coach?
or should I say, a life coach who's dead.
or maybe I got it right the first time.
stop it. That's not funny.
Really? I don't know.
speaking only for myself, I find this very amusing.
my brother really believes in this guy.
my life is my success, my success is my life.
what does that actually mean?
Oh, wait, I didn't read the most important part.$14. 99.
also available in audio book and e-book formats.
sorry, but I'm very dubious about people who charge money to tell you how to succeed in life, when their secret is so obvious.
Oh, really? It's obvious?
sure, just charge people like your brother money for the secret.
you know, you're not being fair.
there's some pretty interesting things in here. Like what?
Like,"Success comes from good judgment, "good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.
well, if that's true, then your brother is gonna be the most successful man on the planet.
I'm just saying, life is a, is a long-distance run, not a one-month sprint.
and I, for one, am not breaking out the champagne for your brother. Not yet.
nerve-racking, isn't it?
just remember, she's just as nervous as you are.
everyone else he's interviewed for the position was just as nervous as you are.
this is crazy. I'm never gonna get this job.
in case you haven't heard, I'm a loser.
you know, when I walk down the street, beggars give me money.
look at my resume. It's got more holes in it than a golf course.
none of that matters.
not today. Everyone's a loser at some point.
some people just choose not to accept it.
my birth name's not Carson Churchill.
it's Hobart Carson.
I chose to become Carson Churchill.
just like you are choosing to become somebody else today.
I don't know.
okay, Michael.
I need you to do something for me.
close your eyes.
now take a deep breath.
look, I am trying to get a job here,
I'm not trying to give birth, okay?
I am trying to help you relax.
now close your eyes.
breathe in through your mouth...
and out through your nose.
one more time.
talk to you soon.
look forward to it.
nice.
what the hell just happened?
I helped you a little.
I hope you don't mind.
what do you mean "helped"?
I don't even remember having the interview.
I helped you relax, then when you loosened up a bit,
I, uh, took the wheel for a while.
I jumped in.
I took the controls.
I did the interview for you.
and I was brilliant.
what do you mean, "took the controls"?
is that even possible?
mm, tricky, but doable.
it's easier if you're relaxed, you know, open to the process.
and you can't argue with results.
uh, but here's the thing, though.
you got a brand-new job now, you got promise, but if you're gonna be a success at it, you're gonna need my help.
don't I know it.
but I'm not finished yet.
my willingness to help you is conditional.
I need a little quid pro quo.
uh, you want to push the elevator button, Michael?
what kind of quid pro quo are you talking about?
I died before my life's work was finished.
I got things I need to do, people I need to inspire.
and to do that, I need a body.
your body, to be exact.
my body? - Yeah the thing is, I'm kind of using it now
no, no, I know. What I'm proposing is, um...
I guess you'd call it a time-share arrangement.
I help you with your career, we build a new and better Michael Benoit, and in exchange, you let me... get behind the wheel.
for a couple hours, every now and then.
you want me to loan my body to you?
sis. - Okay, who am I talking to?
right now. Are you you or are you him?
what the hell are you--Are you Carson or are you Michael?
have you completely lost your mind?
I think you are making way too big a deal out of this.
am I? Hey, is that even possible?
you've given control of your body to another person, Michael.
I don't think there's any bigger deal than that, or a dumber one.
it's not dumb, it's business, okay?
he helps me, I help him, end of story.
he could do anything when he's in control! Anything.
doesn't that even concern you?
this is what he's doing.
this is what he's using me for: his new book.
after he died, he knew he had another book in him, but he had no way of writing it until he met me.
he types, Allison. That's what he does.
while I'm sleeping, he takes over my body, and he types.
he types? - Yeah.
while I'm sleeping.
that's the only catch.
he can only take over the wheel when I'm completely relaxed.
but the nice thing is... I never feel as if I've lost any time.
so now you know everything.
you know, in a couple weeks, once he's finished,
I'll miraculously discover his completed manuscript at a yard sale or something.
I'll take it to his old publisher who can sell it, and then Carson will get the credit, his widow will get the cash, and after that, we are done.
say something.
hello. Lee.
Yeah. Okay, I can be there in about 15 minutes. See you.
it's work. I got to go.
believe me, I understand.
what can I tell you? You got me?
I killed Warren Cheswick, and I'd do it again.
he had it coming.
why do you say that, Mr. Bumgarner?
he murdered my sister.
she disappeared three years ago.
you guys claimed you never figured out who took her.
but when I found out the truth...
well, you know the rest.
wait a second.
what do you mean, the truth?
warren Cheswick was never a suspection your sister's disappearance, or in any crime, for the matter.
we had no idea what he was up to until we found him dead.
well, maybe you didn't suspect Cheswick, but someone at the Phoenix PD sure as hell did.
what are you talking about?
a few days ago, I was in the waiting room of my cardiologist's office.
takes a lot supplements to get a body like this.
left me with a bad heart.
doc says, without a transplant, I'll be lucky to see 50.
anyway, there's this other guy waiting that day, and we got to talking.
said he used to be a detective with the Phoenix PD.
had to retire after a heart attack.
anyway, he recognizes my last name -- Bumgarner.
not easy to forget, right?
said he worked, uh, Carla's case.
that it was a shame that you guys couldn't take down the guy who did it.
you knew it was Cheswick, but you just couldn't pin it on him.
what was this officer's name?
isaac Federer, I think.
it's weird. - What's that?
you know, I worked the disappearance of Carla Bumgarner.
I don't remember anyone named Isaac Federer on that task force.
as a matter of fact, I can't remember ever meeting a detective named Isaac Federer.
I'm home.
keep your applause to a minimum.
Hello, Bridge. Where's Mom?
she and Marie went to go get chicken for dinner.
chicken! Excellent.
what you got going on here? What is this, homework?
no. This is all for the campaign.
actually, I got a promotion.
really! - Yep.
the lady who's running the campaign gave me all this stuff about the man Mr. Devalos is running against.
she wants to see if I can dream about him.
really.
does your mom know about this?
no. Manuel Devalos is going to be the next mayor of Phoenix.
you can either get on board now, or you can miss the boat. It's your call.
Yeah, I don't call that number getting on board.
you're going to have to dig a little deeper.
Yeah, well, keep digging.
you know what? I have to call you back.
is everything all right? - I don't know.
did you actually ask a 12-year-old girl to help us find information we could use against Dalton?
what's the issue, Manuel?
she's not an employee. - She's 12.
I just thought she was kind of short.
so did she see something?
you really don't have a problem with this.
with what? Wanting to win?
let me tell you a little something about elections, Mr. District Attorney.
and I know you've been through your fair share of them, but you only have to think about it every four years. Me?
this is my job all year, every year.
no one is going to remember you for the wonderful campaign you ran.
they're only going to remember you for winning or, worse still, losing.
you're down ten points, Manny.
ten.
so, what's it going to be?
do you want to be the next mayor of Phoenix, or are you running for Miss Congeniality?
hardly a day goes by I don't think about him.
that son of a bitch that killed your sister.
we knew it was him.
those bureaucrats at the prosecutor's office told us we didn't have enough evidence to convict.
but trust me.
a cop knows when he's looking at his perp.
so this guy got a name?
the one you're certain killed my sister.
Yeah, he's got a name. Warren Cheswick.
what are you doing here?
does the name Jason Bumgarner mean anything to you?
how about Warren Cheswick?
no. Never heard of him. Never heard of either of them.
and I imagine you don't remember going to a cardiologist a few days ago?
three days ago... nope.
three days ago was all headshrinkers.
your friend Carson is lying to you.
when he takes over, he's not just typing.
three days ago, he went into a cardiologist's office.
he talked to this man, Jason Bumgarner.
he was inhabiting your body when he did it.
okay, so maybe he knows this Bumgarner guy from when he was alive.
no, Michael. Carson pretended he was a police officer.
he told Bumgarner he knew the name of the man who killed his sister-- a man named Warren Cheswick.
and the next day, Bumgarner killed Cheswick.
Michael, you gotta... you gotta put a stop to this.
you gotta tell him that this deal is off.
Why? - I just told you why.
he used you to get somebody killed.
no, he used me to get a murderer killed.
that's what you just said, right?
that this one guy murdered the other guy's sister?
that's not the point. - Well, it is to me.
so maybe Carson was just trying to bring this guy's sister a little justice.
is that such a bad thing? - Yes. Yes. It's a very bad thing.
he might have made you an accessory to murder.
I don't think so. All I did was say something to somebody.
the rest of it-- that was their doing.
Michael, I know you respect him,
I know that he's done a lot for you, but he's not being honest with you.
well, I disagree.
so, I'm sorry if you don't like what's going on here, but I'm not backing out of anything.
I owe this guy too much.
yes?
the lady at security said you wanted to see me when I got in.
please, have a seat, Bridgette.
listen.
I just wanted to apologize about what happened the other day.
ms. Godrich should never have asked you to look for information that we could use against Charlie Dalton.
that's okay. - No, it isn't.
but I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate the work you're doing on my campaign.
and, provided you still feel comfortable here,
I'd very much like you to stay on.
sure. It's not as if I was going anyplace.
and besides, I think you're going to be a great mayor.
thank you. Coming from you, that means a lot.
is there something else? - Actually, there is.
you know, I did see something when I was looking at that stuff that lady gave me.
now that I've seen it, I can't exactly unsee it, you know?
well, maybe you can't unsee it, but I can still choose not to ask you about it.
it's just not how I want to win this election.
but what if you end up losing 'cause I didn't tell you?
that's a risk I'm willing to take.
if Charlie Dalton has a few skeletons in his closet, well, I'm willing to leave them there.
but that's the thing.
what if I told you he's not the only one with skeletons you need to worry about?
I don't mean to intrude, but, you look how I feel.
I beg your pardon.
well, this bench-- this is where I usually come when I've had a crappy day.
so imagine my surprise when I show up and see someone who looks just about as depressed as I feel.
what's the matter, if you don't mind me asking?
I proposed to my wife on this bench.
she died two weeks ago.
Oh. So sorry to hear that.
thank you.
I'm Ken. Ken Corrigan. - Carson.
so what happened to you today?
just job stuff. Just some stress. Nothing like your thing.
mind if I, de-stress?
want to tip one back for your wife?
wish I could. God, I wish I could.
I'm an alcoholic.
Kathy-- my wife--she stayed with me for a decade when I was a falling-down drunk.
been on the wagon for more than a year now.
well, suit yourself, but, uh, the good thing about the wag on is, you can always get back on.
just a nip, right? - That's right.
easy there, champ.
Oh, my God.
what am I doing?
I'm sorry. I have to go.
Yeah, 911?
I'd like to report a drunk driver.
he's, pulling out of Boyd Park right now.
someone should really pick him up before he hurts somebody.
says here that, the guy blew just over the limit for a DUI.
why do you care?
I'm not sure. What else does it say in that report?
corrigan begged the arresting officer not to write him up.
apparently, he's, got a heart condition.
he's on the waiting list for a transplant.
it turns out the guy's a recovering alcoholic, so they won't transplant him until he spends a certain amount of time on the wagon.
the guy says a DUI would bump him way back down the waiting list.
Hey, wait a second.
that big guy we arrested the other day
the one who killed Warren Cheswick
didn't he have a bad heart?
wasn't he waiting for a heart transplant? - That's what he said.
why do you ask? I got to run.
thanks for your help, Lee.
I got to talk to you.
about what?
about the fact that Carson wasn't writing yesterday?
that he was, in fact, at Boyd Park trying to talk an alcoholic into taking a drink?
Yeah, I know all about it.
they have apps where you can record things with these phones.
so, before I went to sleep,
I started recording and just let it keep recording.
I got some pretty interesting stuff.
the good thing about the wagon is, you can always get back on.
Michael, I think I know what Carson is doing.
I mean, both of these people that he's interfering with, they're both sick.
they're both in line to get heart transplants.
the thing is, they keep a list of who's eligible for those hearts.
and these things that he's trying to convince them to do--commit a felony, get a DUI--they bump you down the list.
his wife, she's sick.
he told me about it the first time we met.
she has heart disease and needs a transplant.
Carson was worried that she wouldn't be healthy enough for the operation by the time a heart became available to her.
so he's trying to move her up the list.
but how many people are ahead of her on that list?
six? 12? 20?
and even if I told them the deal was off, what difference does it make?
he's still gonna take over my body once I fall asleep whether I allow him to or not.
how do we stop him?
I have no idea.
I guess I should have known he'd end up on our couch eventually.
they just go together.
Hey, he needs this right now. He's devastated.
Oh, really? The last time I checked, the cure for devastation wasn't a fistful of NoDoz and a pot of coffee.
we have to keep him awake.
if he falls asleep, Carson Churchill takes over.
it's the only way I can think of to keep Michael Michael.
do me a favor. Fill this up with water.
I gotta get his laundry out of the dryer.
we have a name for people like you, success blockers.
sometimes they're our friends.
more often than not, they're family.
you think you want Michael to live up to his potential, but the truth is you prefer him this way broken, sleeping on your couch, dependent.
it's a shame.
he and I were making so much progress. - Progress, right.
using him to bump people with heart problems off a transplant list.
that was about helping him.
I saved your brother's life. Without me, he's a bent penny someone finds on the railroad tracks.
don't you think I deserve something for that?
you want to know what I think?
I think what you're doing's reprehensible.
look, I'm sorry that your wife is sick, but the people who are on that list ahead of her are there for a reason.
you make it sound like I murdered them. - Didn't you?
I put them in situations where they were forced to make decisions.
Jason Bumgarner decided he'd rather have revenge than a new heart.
Ken Corrigan decided he'd rather have a drink.
everything those men did, they did of their own volition.
Yeah, you just put them on cliffs, it's not like you pushed.
you need to let him go to sleep, Mrs. DuBois.
what? - You heard me.
it's going to happen eventually, it might as well be tonight.
there are still a few names on that list he and I need to attend to.
you are insane.
ultimately, it won't be up to you.
you can't keep him awake forever.
and when he nods off, I'll be back at the wheel.
or I could always accelerate things, stop putting people on cliffs, as you put it, start strang ling them with my own bare hands.
my bare hands will be Michael's bare hands, of course.
you go to Hell.
smoke bothering you?
I can move if you want.
Yeah, I'd like you to move. Closer.
right.
fellow traveler?
you want one?
do I want one? - Absolutely.
can I have one? Absolutely not.
I quit cold turkey six months ago.
good for you.
well, I ruined the heart God gave me, now I'm waiting for another one.
and the doctors tell me I won't get it if I have one of those.
well, have they offered you a new heart yet?
so one smoke, for old times' sake.
how are they gonna know?
Nah, they say the call could come in any day.
well, that seems kind of vague.
could be tomorrow, could be six months from now.
I won't tell if you won't.
I guess one won't hurt.
you got a light? - Indeed I do.
it hasn't happened yet.
you wanted to see me?
shut the door, would you?
so, Bridgette DuBo is did see something the other day.
you're welcome.
so? Tell me, tell me, tell me.
well, do you remember when I interviewed you about managing my campaign?
you told me I should hire you because you had worked with Charlie Dalton, managed his first run for city council?
sure. Okay.
and as I'm sure you'll recall,
Charlie's district was largely comprised of families of means.
his kind of people, I think he called them.
but there was also a less moneyed part of his district that absolutely despised him.
okay... yes... yeah. what did Charlie do?
it's not what Charlie did, Justine, it's what you did.
I beg your pardon?
you were paying an election worker named Eugene to destroy the ballots at his polling place on election day.
took me a few days, but with Bridgette's help
I was able to identify that worker as Eugene Krebs.
he manned the polling place in the poorest part of Charlie's district that year.
this is... this is crazy.
we're talking about something some kid saw in her head.
you can't prove it. - But I can try.
how about if I launch an official investigation, see what Eugene Krebs has to say on the matter?
I think that both you and I know that I'm not a big fan of mud-slinging, dirty politics, negative anything.
so why don't you pack your things and go?
there is one more phone call I'd like you to make.
call Charlie Dalton. Tell him what we discussed here this morning.
and make it clear to him that if he continues to campaign negatively,
I will start that investigation.
Hobie. Do you mind if I call you "Hobie"?
I mean, my brother told me you hate that, but you seem more like a Hobie than a Carson to me.
this is just sad.
why are you so bound and determined to stand in the way of your brother's success?
perhaps you'd rather just visit him in jail.
you know what's funny?
my brother, even after all this, he likes you.
he thinks that you helped him.
I mean, he hates what you're doing.
he hates that you lied to him, but he doesn't think you're a monster.
even after I told him what you said last night, about being willing to commit murder to get what you wanted, being willing to send him to prison forever, he didn't believe it.
he thinks you're better than that.
well, he's wrong. - No, I know.
you know what? You can put those cigarettes away.
you're not going to trick anyone into smoking today.
what's this?
those are my brother's reenlistment papers.
we stopped by the recruiting office this morning, before he fell asleep.
if you don't leave my brother alone, and if you don't end this right here, right now, I'll file those papers.
he'll do another tour of duty.
they'll deploy him, and who knows where, but it's not going to be in Phoenix,
it's not going to be anywhere near any of those people who are ahead of your wife on that list.
smart play.
well, I'll tell Michael that you said so.
it was his idea.
boy's got promise.
he's just a late bloomer.
do me a favor.
tell him there's nothing I did for him that he can't keep doing for himself.
tell him...that he can still be a success.
tell him he can still be the best Michael he can be.
well, I think he knows that already, but I'll pass that message along.
Hey, Carson. Michael.
Hey, hey. You can't sleep here.
we're here.
so what's the verdict? Am I back in the Army?
no, not today.
no, you know what? You read him exactly right.
much better than I did.
see, that's why you're such a great salesman.
pardon me.
would you mind scooting over a bit, so I can sit?
you know what? We were just leaving.
I have to get back to work. It's all yours.
meet The Robinsons
then I didn't choose that one because it was gonna give me pimples, so I choosed another scary one because, for all those years that I went for Halloween,
I wasn't scary at all.
I love baseball. It's my destiny to play that game.
I don't really care about winning.
well, like, now I do 'cause, like, we've lost every game.
I've gotten tired of it.
I'm working, like, so hard. All the balls are getting thrown to me.
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.
all of the people in the outfield are all looking around and...
come on! Let's play some baseball, okay?
not the lazy game.
they're here.
Lewis?
Lewis?
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!
they are gonna love this!
nothing says "adopt me" like a weird invention.
Lewis!
Lewis, the Harringtons are here! - Way ahead of you, Mildred.
wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.
remember, sit up straight. Look them in the eye.
smile. Let's fix your...
Mildred.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
go show them how special you are.
Oh, I hope this is it.
I hope he gets adopted.
you and me both, chief.
I mean, there's so many things in the world that can be improved.
just think of it. Moving sidewalks, flying cars.
the possibilities are endless.
flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.
all it takes is some imagination and a little science, and we can make the world a better place.
well, these are all interesting ideas.
so, what's your favourite sport?
well, does inventing count as a sport? - Actually...
cause I think I hit a home run with this one!
what is that? - First, a question.
what's the number one problem that you face when you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Lewis, I don't think we... - Portion control.
too much peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth, takes forever to chew.
too much jelly squishes out the sides and makes your hands all sticky.
well, I propose that the perfect P. B. and J.
is within mankind's grasp, and I've built this machine to achieve it.
for this demonstration, I'll use regular bread.
honey, it's okay.
as you can see, toasting is an option.
we don't usually eat peanut butter.
Lewis, this is really not necessary.
it's jammed!
Lewis, please, don't!
what's happening?
mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!
I'm sorry!
here let me help you get that off!
stand back!
is he gonna be okay? - Breathe. Breathe.
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!
it was really nice to meet you.
we're gonna need some time to think about it.
Hi, folks. Everything all...
what happened?
miss Duffy, that boy is definitely not right for us.
now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm so sorry about this. If you would just...
I made some lunch. - Not hungry.
poor Mr Harrington.
I killed him? - No. No! No, you didn't kill him.
I called. He's perfectly fine.
I was just gonna say that it's...
it's too bad he didn't get to try a sandwich from that wonderful invention of yours.
Yeah, real wonderful. - It's not you.
we just haven't found the right couple yet.
one hundred twenty-four.
what?
that's how many adoption interviews I've had, 124.
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.
you're exaggerating just to make your point.
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year, and you know how hard it is for a teenager to get adopted.
I have no future. No one wants me.
that's not true, Lewis!
my own mother didn't even want me.
now, stop it. You do not know that.
then why'd she give me up?
she may not have been able to take care of you.
did you ever think of that?
I am sure that she was only thinking about what was best for you.
I never thought of it that way.
maybe she wanted to keep you, but she had no choice.
you're right.
my real mom is the only person who's ever wanted me.
wait. I said "maybe."
and if she wanted me then, she'll want me now.
what are you talking about?
I have to find her, Mildred, and when I do, she'll take me back, and we'll be a family again!
whoa, whoa, whoa! Lewis, you can't do that.
no one knows anything about her. No one even saw her.
wrong. I saw her once.
she's in here. I just have to remember.
that's it!
hello
I got something to tell you
but it's crazy
I got something to show you
so give me just one more chance
one more glance And I will make of you
another believer
guess what? You got more than you bargained
ain't it crazy?
you got more than you paid for
so give me just one more chance
one more glance
one more hand to hold
you've been on my mind
though it may seem I'm fooling
wasted so much time
though it may seem I'm fooling
what are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do about it?
you've been on my mind
one more chance
wasted so much time
one more chance
so tired.
we'll see you at 2: 00 this afternoon. He'll be so excited you're coming.
Bye-bye, now.
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.
good luck at the big game today. - Easy win.
those guys are a bunch of bums.
I just hope I can stay awake.
don't tell me. Let me guess.
he was up all night working on his stupid project, but that's what happens when you get a science geek for a roommate.
Ah, that's good joe.
all right, Einstein, you owe Michael big time.
well, unlocking the secrets of the brain took a lot longer than I expected, but it's finished, Mildred. I recalibrated the headset.
now the neural circuits will connect.
I've cracked the hippocampus!
Really? Okay. What?
now to test it out.
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!
wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.
I almost forgot what I came up here for.
I know you have a lot on your plate today, but I've scheduled an interview for you this afternoon.
no, thanks. - "No, thanks"?
sweetheart, this is about being adopted, and you will be back here clean, happy and on time.
I'm done with interviews, Mildred. I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.
listen, I know where your head is, but I'm telling you, you have got to get out of the past and look to the future.
I am, and this is it.
this is my future.
I'm sorry.
Lewis? Honey?
dr Krunklehorn, I know you're very busy there at Inventco Labs, and we're just so excited to have you as a judge.
it's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein. Hey, you never know.
one of your students may invent the next integrated circuit or microprocessor or integrated circuit.
Oh, wait! I said that already.
well, I just don't get out of that lab very much.
is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.
I haven't slept in eight days!
well, then can I get you a cot or something?
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch. It's my invention.
each patch is the equivalent of 12 cups of coffee.
you can stay awake for days with no side effects.
sorry. Who's this?
this is one of our students, Stanley Pukowski.
Oh, so cute!
I just want to bite his chubby little cheeks!
what's with the dress, Pukowski?
it's actually a toga, sir.
coach, nice to see you, sort of. What are you doing here?
judging a science fair. What's it look like I'm doing?
and what makes you qualified to judge a science fair?
it's my gym.
Stanley. Volcano.
behold the awesome power of Mount Vesuvius!
the toggle switch isn't toggling.
dr Krunklehorn?
barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!
I don't know what she just said, but this project is unacceptable!
now, give me 20 laps around the gym!
move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!
coach! - I'm watching you.
okay, next up is Lizzy and her fire ant farm.
that's right.
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.
you know that they have a tendency to bite people.
only my enemies.
just keep moving, shall we? Top notch, Lizzy!
let's not anger her or make her jumpy in any way.
this area's not secure. Get in.
have you been approached by a tall man in a bowler hat?
what? - Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.
okay, goodbye. - All right, didn't want to pull rank on you, but you forced my hand.
special Agent Wilbur Robinson of the T. C.T. F.
the what? - Time Continuum Task Force.
I'm here to protect you. - Well...
now, tall man, bowler hat, approached you?
no, why?
I could lose my badge for this.
he's a suspect in a robbery.
what did he steal?
a time machine. - A what?
I've tracked him to this time, and my informants say he's after you.
me? Why me?
the boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet.
and by "HQ," I mean "headquarters."
I know what HQ means.
good. You're a smart kid.
that might keep you alive, for now.
just worry about your little science gizmo and leave the "perp" to me.
and by "perp," I mean... - I know what it means!
okay, Mr Smarty-pants.
bowler Hat Guy!
my frogs!
you're not gonna get away with it, kid with science project.
dude, you almost busted my solar system!
my frogs! They're getting away!
got you! That's the last of them.
annoying little girl, I don't have time for this.
I'm on a very important...
don't sass me, boy. I know karate.
come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain! Love the pain!
coach...
next up is Lewis.
yes... Lewis! Excuse me.
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...
it's okay. It's gonna work this time. I won't let you down, I promise.
all right, Lewis, I trust you. Knock 'em dead.
that was a figure of speech. Please don't kill anyone.
okay, stand back, everybody.
this next project will knock your socks off.
seriously, you might wanna stand back a little.
have you ever forgotten something, and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't remember it?
well, what happens to these forgotten memories?
I propose they're stored somewhere in your brain, and I built a machine that can retrieve them.
I call it the Memory Scanner.
it's shiny!
so, Lewis, how does the Memory Scanner work?
first, you input the desired period of time on this keypad.
then a laser scans the cerebral cortex, where memories are stored.
the retrieved memory is then displayed on this monitor.
wrap him up. I'll take two.
now, I'm going back 12 years, three months and 11 days.
why that particular day?
you didn't think I was paying attention, did you?
well, that was the day...
let's just say, that was a very important day in my life.
fair enough. Play ball.
it'll just take a second to get the turbines going.
Lewis, wait!
she's gonna blow!
watch out!
feel the pain! Love the...
hurts so much! Make it stop!
make it stop!
coach, suck it up, okay?
let us conduct ourselves in a way that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.
I didn't mean to... - Not now, Lewis!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
not now.
okay, and we are walking in a calm, orderly fashion toward the exits.
wait, Lewis!
come, my dear. Our future awaits.
Hey, what are you doing up here?
would you quit that, please? I know you're not a pigeon.
you're blowing my cover.
we're the only ones up here.
that's just what they want you to think.
now, enough moping.
take this back to the science fair and fix that Memory Scanner.
stop! Stop! Get away from me!
maybe you've forgotten.
I'm a time cop from the future, should be taken very seriously.
that's no badge.
this is a coupon for a tanning salon! You're a fake.
okay, you got me. I'm not a cop, but I really am from the future, and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.
here we go again.
he stole a time machine, came to the science fair and ruined your project.
my project didn't work because I'm no good.
there is no Bowler Hat Guy, there is no time machine, and you're not from the future!
you're crazy!
I am not crazy.
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel? Prove it.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm just gonna go lock myself in my room and hide under the covers for a couple years.
if I prove to you I'm from the future, will you go back to the science fair?
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.
Hey, let go of me!
what are you doing? Let go of me! - Okay.
what is this? Where are we going?
to the future!
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
is this proof enough for you?
is it ever!
I never thought that time travel could be possible in my lifetime, and here it is, right in front of me!
the truth will set you free, brother.
this is beyond anything I could've imagined.
this means I could really change my life.
that's right. You can.
next stop, science fair, to fix your Memory Scanner.
Hey, I'm not gonna fix that stupid Memory Scanner.
what? - Wilbur, this is a time machine!
why should I fix my dumb invention when you can take me to see my mom now in this ship?
I could actually go back to that night and stop her from giving me up.
the answer is not a time machine. It's this.
this? You want to know what I think about this?
what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you don't know what I've lived through.
Lewis, no! - Let go!
you let go! - You're not the boss of me!
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.
that makes me older.
well, I was born in the past, which makes me older and the boss of you!
I am so dead.
I'm not allowed to look at this thing, let alone drive it!
mom and Dad are gonna kill me, and I can tell you this. It will not be done with mercy.
isn't there like a time machine repair shop - or something? - No!
there's only two time machines in existence, and the Bowler Hat Guy has the other one!
well, somebody's gonna have to fix this.
good idea. You're smart. You fix it.
are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.
all right, under one condition.
I fix it, you take me back to see my mom.
what? You didn't even follow through on our last deal.
how can I trust you?
well, you told me you were a time cop from the future.
how can I trust you?
touch?
so do we have a deal?
good day, madam.
I'm here to change the future. - Yes, sir?
I must speak with the man in charge immediately.
Yes, sir. - I have an appointment with destiny.
very good, sir. I'll let Smith know, and I'll have your dry cleaning delivered directly to your suite.
what? - Now, what time is your appointment?
are you talking to me? - Yes.
what time is your appointment?
big hand is on the... Oh, 2: 00!
you're the 2: 00?
Yes. Yes, I am.
you're Mary Johnson?
Yes.
Mary is short for...
Marian?
can that be a boy name? - Yes.
then yes. - Have a seat.
Oh, goody!
"pass off invention as my own." Check. Oh, I love checklists.
the board is ready to see you now.
wait. What am I going to say?
I'm never gonna remember that.
would you... Why don't you go? You do it so much better than me.
that's true.
a hat without a head couldn't really pass off an invention as its own.
fantastic! Great idea! I'm so glad I have you!
prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!
prepare to be amazed!
this is my invention.
I doubt any of you have seen anything as brilliant as this device.
very well,
miss Johnson?
it's Ms.
you have two minutes. Please begin.
it's shiny! - What is that thing?
well, I like to call it my...
to call it my...
what are you looking at? - No! I... The sun, in my eyes.
well, then let me close the blinds.
now, the name?
well, what...
we can quibble about names at a later date.
the point is, what I have here is special, unique.
Yes. Yes, you must love it and buy it and mass produce it, and the best part is, it's got really comfy headphones.
I wonder, could you lean forward just a little bit, please?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, they are quite comfortable.
what do you hope to accomplish with this?
Oh, nothing of consequence.
I simply wish to crush the dreams of a poor little orphan boy!
after that, it's all a little fuzzy.
you mean, you haven't thought this through?
thirty seconds.
allow me to show you how it works.
first, we turn it on.
that's not it.
ten seconds.
so where do I sign?
Doris, it's all over.
all our hopes and dreams dashed, like so many pieces of a broken machiney thing.
you're right.
success is still ours for the taking.
we must find that boy.
we'll sneak this thing into the garage. You'll have all the tools you need.
what about your parents?
mom never goes in there, and Dad's on a business trip until tomorrow morning.
you've got till then to fix it.
well, fine, but I'm gonna need some blueprints or something for this.
no worries. I got someone who could help us with that.
who dares to disturb my sanctuary?
Carl, it's me. Let me in.
none may enter unless they speak the royal password.
Carl, what are you talking about? We don't have a password.
Yes, we do. I made one up while you were gone.
well, then how am I supposed to know what it is?
you...
good point.
welcome back, little buddy.
so what's up with the stolen time machine?
did you find it? Apparently not, and you managed to bust this one as well.
it'll be fixed before Dad gets home.
and how do you suppose that's gonna...
who's that? - Wow, a real robot!
Hi, I'm Lewis.
well, that was unexpected.
as was that.
if my family finds out I brought you from the past, they'll bury me alive and dance on my grave.
I'm not exaggerating. Well, yes, I am, but not the point.
the point is, your hair's a dead giveaway.
why would my hair be a dead giveaway?
that is an excellent question.
wait! Where are you going?
another excellent question.
but I don't just want to sit here.
stay.
but...
Wow!
Hey, ring my doorbell.
no, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.
ring it. Ring it. Ring it. Look at this door bell. Ring it.
Yes! - That was accidental.
that's an accidental ring. It doesn't count.
it's in the rule book. Look it up.
flat head. - Short roots.
evergreen.
what do you mean, don't go to the family?
how can we not go to the family in this time of family crisis?
by leaving the garage door unlocked, you let the time machine get stolen, and now the entire time stream could be altered!
that and someone took my bike.
look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.
first, we keep Lewis in the garage, away from everybody.
I show up and give him the pep talk of the century.
then he fixes the time machine.
why is it an acorn?
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.
okay, now, the time machine is fixed.
his confidence in inventing is restored.
he goes back to the science fair, fixes his Memory Scanner, thus restoring the space-time continuum.
what about taking him back to see his mom?
I just told him that to buy some time.
Oh, yeah, can't see that one blowing up in your face.
trust me. I got it under control.
wilbur Robinson never fails.
but on the slight chance that I do...
"on the slight chance," yeah. You know what? I'll run the numbers.
what is it?
well, it's not...
it doesn't pertain to anything in... You know, there's not necessarily...
there's a 99. 999999% chance that you won't exist.
what? - And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.
I won't exist?
and where does that leave me?
alone, rusting in a corner.
what am I worried about? Now, blueprints?
if this thing ever blows over, I really gotta get away from you and get some quiet time.
what's...
well, hey, there, little fella!
now, I know what you're thinking, and my clothes are not on backwards.
my head is!
Oh, I used to tell that one to my science students.
they didn't laugh, either.
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?
well, Lewis, but... - Lewis, huh?
well, say, Lewis, you haven't seen any teeth around here, have you?
teeth? - Yeah, my teeth.
been digging holes all day. Can't find them anywhere.
all right, look, old man, I need to get back to the garage.
wilbur left me down there, and I wasn't supposed to leave, and these monsters...
monsters? ... attacked me on the porch and...
there's no monsters on the porch, you ninny.
listen to me! - Of course, I also didn't think there was a woodchuck living on my arm, and lookie there!
hope he ain't got rabies.
old man, I need to get to the garage!
well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy. I know a shortcut.
welcome to the garage.
well, I'm completely lost.
Hiya, Grandpa.
Hey, Aunt Billie.
Lewis and me are looking for the garage.
we have a garage? - Apparently so.
Lewis, will you give me a hand and time my race?
okay, Gaston, my toy train's ready for you.
that's a toy train?
on your mark, get set, go?
3. 7 seconds. - I win!
okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.
Lewis?
and five and six and seven and eight. - That's Uncle Joe. He works out.
keep those tummies tucked.
this isn't the garage.
I know.
I don't think the garage is in here, either.
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.
that's Uncle Art. - A real superhero?
quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy, needs a large cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
he's a... - Pizza delivery guy.
Lewis?
what are we doing up here? - Looking for the garage.
Oh, yeah!
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat, or I'm telling Ma!
lighten up, sis! - Lasz, I mean it!
children, please! Your mother is trying to take a nap.
what is all the yelling out here?
he started it! - She started it!
I don't want to hear any more!
now, sweetie... - Don't you "sweetie" me!
I'm going for a drive!
that's strange. She usually takes the Harley.
Lewis!
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.
bake them cookies, Lucille!
why is your dog wearing glasses?
Oh, 'cause his insurance won't pay for contacts.
that's Uncle Spike, and there's Uncle Dimitri.
Oh, look, there's... - That's the monster!
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.
nice to meet you.
Hey, Lefty, any idea how to get to the garage?
well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.
who? - Wilbur's mom, Franny.
I think you'll like her.
Hey, guys!
you ask me over And over and over
have you seen My peacock-feathered hat?
frogs?
taught them everything they know.
Franny, this is Lewis. - Nice to meet you, ma'am.
perfect timing. We need someone on maracas.
where is your heart at? Nobody knows that
even though you've him, her, me
and an army searching
I've got a feeling You will be reeling
when you are bad And the circus comes to town
grandpa, I think I found your teeth.
and you see me leaving Dressed up as a magician
or something like that
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!
Ring-a-ding-ding.
all right!
right. Well, glad I could help with the teeth, but, wow, look at the time.
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!
I did, but I went up the tube, and I ran into your family, and I...
you met my family?
pop quiz.
who have you met, and what have you learnt?
okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...
cranky? Yes.
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.
Joe is married to Billie. Lefty is the butler.
spike and Dimitri are twins, and I don't know who they're related to.
neither do we. Go on.
Lucille is married to Bud, and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.
what does Cornelius look like?
Tom Selleck.
okay, Cornelius is married to Franny, and her brothers are Gaston and Art.
you're forgetting something.
forgetting? Oh, right.
wilbur is the son of Franny and Cornelius.
and nobody realised you were from the past?
Nope.
thank you. Thank you.
hold your applause. Thank you very much.
Doris, get it off! Get it off!
I've got you now.
Lewis!
no, Lewis is my stupid roommate.
my name's Mike Yagoobian. People call me Goob, but today, everyone that beat me up called me "puke face"
and "butterfingers" and "booger breath."
nice to see that they're branching out.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
well, I was just looking for Lewis.
try the roof. He's always up there being dumb.
of course. Why didn't I think of that?
mr Steak, you're my only friend.
game didn't go so well, huh?
no, I fell asleep in the ninth inning, and I missed the winning catch.
then I got beat up.
afterwards, Coach took me aside and told me to let it go.
I don't know. He's probably right.
No!
everyone will tell you to let it go and move on, but don't.
instead, let it fester and boil inside of you.
take these feelings and lock them away.
let them fuel your actions.
let hate be your ally, and you will be capable of wonderfully horrid things.
heed my words, Goob. Don't let it go.
what?
where is that boy?
good idea! Separate and look for clues.
look, my dear! Look what I found! It's a stick.
now, what did you find?
Yes. Yes, I see.
time travel residue next to DNA from Wilbur Robinson.
that plus my stick must mean...
to the future! Shotgun!
I don't even know what I'm doing.
keep moving forward.
I mean, this stuff is way too advanced for me.
keep moving forward.
and what if I can't fix this? What are we gonna do?
keep moving forward.
why do you keep saying that?
and don't just say, "Keep moving forward."
it's my dad's motto.
why would his motto be "keep moving forward"?
it's what he does.
what's that supposed to mean?
that is an excellent question.
Robinson Industries, the world's leading scientific-research-and-design factory.
my dad runs the company. They mass produce his inventions.
his motto, "Keep moving forward." It's what he does.
what has he invented? - Everything.
Carl, the time machine, the travel tubes.
your dad invented the time machine?
Yep. Five years ago,
dad wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat.
he wants to build a time machine, so he starts working.
we're talking plans. We're talking scale models.
we're talking prototypes.
that's a prototype?
the very first, or what's left of it. - Yikes.
Yeah. Dark day at the Robinson house.
prototypes two and three, not much better.
number six, 58, 212, 485, 952, and they all end the same way.
but he doesn't give up.
dude, I can't take you seriously in that hat.
he keeps working and working until finally he gets it, the first working time machine.
then he keeps working and working until finally he gets it again, the second working time machine.
kind of small.
I'm assuming that's a joke. I'm ignoring you for time reasons.
this, my friend, is merely a model because, unfortunately, time machine number two is in the hands of the Bowler Hat Guy.
pretty amazing story, huh? - Yeah.
now, are you ready to start working?
I think that's it. I did it!
I knew you could.
nice work, my friend.
well, you know what they say! "Keep moving...
don't say it!
boys! Dinner time!
not now, Mom!
if you aren't up here in five minutes, I'm gonna come down and get you!
we'd better get up there.
let's get that boy!
sit here?
but I want to look, too.
a mini-Doris!
I didn't even know you could do that. It's so cute.
let's take her out for a spin.
sorry.
teamwork.
sorry.
sorry!
there you are.
now, to lure him out of the house.
I know! I'll blow it up! Yes! Yes, and... No.
no, that won't work. Then he'll be dead.
Oh! I know!
I'll turn him into a duck! Yes! Yes, it's so evil!
I don't know how to do that.
I don't really need a duck.
this may be harder than I thought.
Hey, ring my doorbell.
no, no, no, no, ring this doorbell.
that doorbell will give you a rash.
Yes! I'm two for two, man.
if they don't do it on purpose, it doesn't count.
come on. Read your rule book. - You know what?
you can take your rule book and shove it right...
I don't believe in fretting or grieving
why mess around with strife?
guess I was cut out To step out and strut out
give me the simple life
ladies and gentlemen, dinner is served.
dinner is served.
dinner is served.
Hooray! Italian food.
I want a sloppy joe!
Oh, Billie, could you please pass the gravy?
coming to you, big girl.
reminds me of the time my meatball pizza staved off civil war on the black moon of Keward.
Where's my sloppy joe?
thank you for the gravy, Aunt Billie.
we gotta talk. - How about some gravy? Over here.
why is the kid still here? Any of this ring a bell?
science fair, Memory Scanner, a time stream that needs fixing?
temporary setback.
he's just having a little confidence issue.
you want me to talk to him? - No.
I give a mean back rub. - No.
shiatsu? - No.
feng shui. - No.
I've got it under control.
so, Lewis, are you in Wilbur's class?
no. - Yes.
Yes. - No.
well, yes and no.
Lewis is a new transfer student.
Yeah.
where are you from, Lewis? - Canada?
I think you mean North Montana. Hasn't been called Canada in years.
do you know Sam Gundersen?
it's a big country. - State.
I wonder if you're related. - Maybe if he took his hat off.
Oh, good idea.
then we can see if he has the family cowlick.
he can't, because he's got bad hat-hair.
Oh, nonsense.
a North Montana man doesn't care about hat-hair.
let's see the cowlick!
all right, everyone, hold your horses.
Lewis, do you mind?
I'm afraid this isn't gonna stop otherwise.
but... But... - And so it begins.
now, don't be shy.
we're all family here. - Ready, aim, fire!
surely, that is not the best you can do.
impressive, little sister.
your skills are strong, but not strong enough.
your words do not threaten me, brother.
then enough words. Now the real battle begins.
your meatballs are useless against me.
then perhaps it's time for spicy Italian sausage!
No!
that's right. I did it.
is dinner like this every night?
no, yesterday, we had meatloaf.
okay, gang, time for the second course.
and what goes better with meatballs than P. B. and J?
Hey, that's just like...
stupid...
Carl?
is everything all right?
we're just experiencing bugs.
just what the doctor ordered.
my friend Lewis is an inventor. He can fix it.
Wilbur, you know I can't.
come on. Give it a try.
you don't understand what's at stake here.
uncle Joe's seen the toast!
we're past the point of no return!
if he doesn't get P. B. and J...
we all pay!
I don't know.
you would really be helping us out, Lewis.
please.
one dragonfly on the rocks, please, Mr Barkeep.
Hey, hey, Frankie, baby, you gotta tell us one of your jokes.
Yeah, Frankie. How about that one with the bullfrog?
all right, you bozos.
have to get that boy out of the house.
sorry. Wait!
so I turn to the bullfrog, and you know what I says?
talking frogs with their own little outdoor bar, and so smartly dressed! Perfect!
I says, "Hey, not with my umbrella, you don't.
Frankie, you're a riot. - I gotta go pee!
I love it. - You bunch of goons.
that's a good buzz. What the...
Yes! You are now under my control.
I am now under your control.
stop laughing. - Stop laughing.
don't repeat everything I say. - I won't repeat everything you say.
excellent. - Excellent.
did you just say, "Excellent," because I said, "Excellent"?
no.
excellent. - Excellent.
so, Mr Fix-it, how's it looking? - Pretty good, Mrs Robinson.
I've recalibrated the dispensing conduits and aligned the ejection mechanism and...
there he is, that repulsive, half-witted fool!
now, my slave, seize the boy.
bring him to me.
did you not hear what I said, you idiot? Grab the boy and bring him!
well, it's just that there's a million people over there, and I have little arms.
I'm just not so sure how well this plan was thought through.
master?
master?
okay, that should do it.
it's so exciting. Let her rip, Lewis!
quickly. Uncle Joe can't hold on much longer.
everybody ready?
go, Carl. - Yeah!
is it gonna work?
Oh, no!
No!
I didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
you failed! - And it was awesome!
exceptional! - Outstanding!
I've seen better.
from failing, you learn. From success, not so much.
if I gave up every time I failed,
I never would have made the meatball cannon.
I never would have made my fireproof pants.
still working out the kinks.
like my husband always says...
keep moving Keep moving
stop
okay, talking frog, not a good minion.
need another henchman, something large, not too bright.
something that won't talk back.
what is he still doing here? Get rid of him.
Oh, my noggin.
Hey, what are you doing? Get your lousy mitts off of me!
you're gonna regret this!
wait! Wait! Don't move. That's it!
I wonder if I should tell Doris.
no, I'll make it a surprise.
all right, everyone, quiet down. Quiet down.
I propose a toast to Lewis and his brilliant failure.
may it lead to success in the future.
gosh, you're all so nice.
if I had a family, I...
I'd want them to be just like you.
Oh, well, then, to Lewis!
to Lewis!
to Lewis!
Yeah!
come on, Lewis! - Good show, buddy!
what if Louis Armstrong said, "I can't"?
you think he'd have walked on the moon?
dear, Louis Armstrong was a singer.
what did he mean, if he had a family?
Oh, Lewis is an orphan.
orphan?
Oh, no! - Big boy!
get up, you pansy!
what a great plan!
go back in time and steal a dinosaur. Oh, Doris will be so proud of me.
why didn't you tell me you had a pet dinosaur?
because we don't.
what are you talking about? He's standing right here.
Oh, no! No, you can't eat him!
I need him alive.
Choo-chew on this!
Lewis!
ready, aim, fire!
got you!
you messed with the wrong family!
Ding-dong! Pizza's here!
No!
okay, everybody, this dino's deep-dished.
run!
Oh! He ate Carl!
help us! Help! Help! - Oh, goodness!
Oh, no.
incoming!
run!
now, go get that boy!
what's going on?
why aren't you seizing the boy?
I have a big head...
...and little arms.
I'm just not sure...
...how well this plan was thought through.
master?
stupid, stupid, stupid!
bowler Hat Guy!
him you can eat.
Lewis, run! - Wilbur!
No!
Oh, no!
little Doris now sleeps with the fishes.
nice catch. - Nice meatball shooting!
guess we made a pretty good team, huh?
Yeah, guess we did.
are you boys all right? - We're good, Mom.
Yeah, didn't you see us take out that dinosaur?
Oh, man! It was so cool, Mom!
Oh, I mean, I'm sorry. I didn't...
Oh, Lewis, it's okay.
I'm really happy you're safe.
your head. - What?
it's just a bruise, Lewis.
you all sacrificed so much for me.
well, of course. - You are a special kid.
one of a kind.
okay, you should get him out of here before something really bad happens.
silly, silly robot. I've got it all under control.
okay, everybody, it's been a long, hard day filled with emotional turmoil and dinosaur fights, so why don't you all hit the hay, and Lewis and me will get going?
do you have to go now? I mean, you know, it's getting late.
maybe Lewis could spend the night.
mom, maybe some other time, okay?
well, any time you want to come over, you just come over.
mom. - The truth is, we love having you.
we really have to go. - No.
no, you don't. You have to stay.
I mean, who would be a better family for you than us?
what do you say, Lewis?
do you want to be a Robinson?
you want to adopt me?
Yeah! - Yes!
okay, it's true. I'm from the past.
now you know the big secret.
Wilbur, what have you done? How could you bring him here?
that is an excellent question.
please, don't get mad at Wilbur.
he was just being a good friend.
Lewis, I am so sorry, but you have to go.
what? You just said...
I know what I said.
I'm from the past. So what?
Lewis. Lewis, look at me. You're...
you're a great kid, and we would never do anything to hurt you, but I'm sorry. You have to go back to your own time.
Yeah, about that, one of the time machines is broken, and the other one was stolen by a guy with a bowler hat, which kind of explains the dino.
I'm calling your father.
wait. If I have to leave, can I at least go back and find my mom?
wilbur promised.
you promised what?
I was never gonna do it. I swear!
you lied to me? - No!
Yes.
Lewis! Lewis, wait!
I can't believe I was dumb enough to actually believe you were my friend!
I am your friend!
mister, you're grounded till you die.
Oh, yes, Doris, it is a shame.
all he wants to do is go back in time to meet the mother he never knew, but they won't let him. We'd let him, though.
too bad we don't have a time machine.
Oh, wait. We do.
bowler Hat Guy?
Hello, Lewis. - What do you want?
to make your dream come true.
all you have to do is put Humpty Dumpty back together again, and we'll take you back to find your mommy.
Lewis!
let's just talk about this, Lewis. Come on!
I know you're around here somewhere.
Lewis!
I can't imagine why you're so interested in this piece of junk.
that's for me to know and you to find out.
now, show me how to work this thing.
it doesn't work. Never did.
well, supposing it did, and if one were presenting the invention to, say, a board of directors for a very large invention company, where might one find the "On" switch?
hypothetically speaking, of course.
all right, first, you turn this knob twice, then push this red button, and that's it. It's pretty easy.
what a stupid way to turn it on!
okay, take me to see my mom now.
Yes, of course.
Doris?
we had a deal!
Crossies! Doesn't count.
why are you doing this to me? I never did anything to you.
you still haven't figured it out?
figured out what?
well, let's see if this rings a bell.
father of the Future, inventor extraordinaire, "Keep moving forward"?
that's not me. That's Wilbur's dad.
are you saying that I'm Wilbur's dad?
give the boy a prize.
you grew up to be the founder of this wretched time, so I plan to destroy your destiny.
easy peasy, rice and cheesy. - Well...
so if I'm Wilbur's dad...
keep going.
if I'm Wilbur's dad...
Yes, thank you, we've established that.
but what does that have to do with you?
allow me to shed some light on the subject.
my old room!
I think you mean our old room.
what? - Yes! Yes, it is I,
Mike Yagoobian!
I know. I'm disgusting, but one learns to love it.
how did you end up like this?
well, it's a long and pitiful story about a young boy with a dream, a dream of winning a Little League championship, a dream that was ruined in the last inning.
we lost by one run because of me.
get him!
if I hadn't fallen asleep, I would have caught the ball!
and we would have won!
do you understand?
for some reason, no one wanted to adopt me.
whiz kid Cornelius Robinson graduates from college at age 14.
this year's Nobel Prize goes to a young Cornelius Robinson.
Hey, Goob, what's up? Cool binder.
Hey, Goob, wanna come over to my house today?
they all hated me.
eventually, they closed down the orphanage and everyone left, except me.
Cornelius Robinson rebuilds Inventco.
Robinson reaches out to... - It's new name, - Robinson Industries. - Cornelius Robinson!
Cornelius Robinson is now... - Now here's another amazing...
it was then that I realised it wasn't my fault.
it was yours.
if you hadn't kept me up all night working on your stupid project, then I wouldn't have missed the catch, so I devised a brilliant plan to get my revenge.
Robinson, you stink!
then, just as I was on the brink of destroying Robinson Industries,
I met her.
we retreated to our villainous lair, where Doris spun a tale of deception and woe.
apparently, you invented her to be a Helping Hat, a slave to humankind, but Doris knew she was capable of so much more.
however, you didn't see her true potential.
got it. - So you shut her down, or so you thought.
we both had a score to settle with you, and while my plan for revenge was brilliant, Doris' was...
well, we went with Doris', but I made a very, very important contribution.
together we made the perfect team.
Wilbur!
make sure you shut that door tight, or else the alarm won't engage.
Yeah, Mom.
I went to your house, snuck in the garage and stole the time machine, all thanks to that pointy-haired little kid who forgot to lock the garage door.
and now all that's left is to return to Inventco, where I'll pass off your little gizmo as my own.
but you have no idea what that could do to this future!
I don't care. I just want to ruin your life.
Goob, I had no idea.
shut up! And don't call me Goob!
how many evil villains do you know who can pull off a name like Goob?
look, I'm sorry your life turned out so bad, but don't blame me. You messed it up yourself.
you just focused on the bad stuff when all you had to do was let go of the past and keep moving forward.
let's see.
take responsibility for my own life or blame you.
"blame you" wins hands down!
this is gonna be the best day of my life!
Doris, would you be a dear and open the hatch for me, please?
No!
well, I hate to foil your evil plan and run, but ta-ta!
but...
I bet you're glad to see me.
that's for not locking the garage door.
you know about that?
I know everything.
you gotta admit, this will be a great story to tell me someday.
look at that, boys. We're almost home free.
Oh, no!
take a good look around, boys, because your future is about to change.
Lewis, you have to fix the time machine.
no. No, I can't.
what about your dad? You could call him.
you are my dad. - But that's in the future.
there won't be a future unless you fix the time machine.
look, I messed up.
I left the garage unlocked, and I've tried like crazy to fix things, but now it's up to you.
you can do it, Dad.
Lewis? Lewis! - Wilbur? Wilbur!
Wilbur.
Mrs Robinson? Uncle Art? Lefty?
prepare to be amazed.
I call it the Memory Scanner.
so, Yagoobian, any other ideas you'd like to share with us?
Yes. I call them Helping Hats.
they're everywhere!
Doris, what's happening? I don't understand.
I just wanted to ruin his future, not this.
No!
no. No, this can't be happening! No!
Oh, Lewis, it's already happened.
why did I ever invent that stupid hat?
take a good look around, Doris, 'cause your future's about to change.
Goob, stop!
you don't know what you're doing!
Yes, I do. I'm ruining your future.
she's using you, Goob, and when she gets what she wants, she'll get rid of you.
what? What?
I am never going to invent you.
come on, Goob. I've got to show you something.
Doris?
I thought she was my friend.
you did it, Lewis. You did it!
I'll hold him while you run for help.
let him go.
what are you doing? He's the bad guy.
no, he's not. He's my roommate.
what? - He's my old roommate, and I really think you guys should adopt him.
are you nuts? - Give me one good reason why not.
I'll give you three good reasons.
he stole our time machine, tried to ruin your future, and he smells like he hasn't showered in 30 years!
may I remind you, I'm your father, and you have to do what I say.
okay, Mr Yagoobian, do you want to be a...
Where'd he go? - Goob?
Goob!
Goob.
are you hurt? Any broken bones?
no, I'm... - Do you have a temperature?
brain fag? - Scurvy?
tapeworm? - Cellulite?
no. No, no, I'm fine. I feel fine.
in fact, better than I've felt in a long time.
Franny, they're gone. Oh, this is terrible!
Oh, boy. - Well, he's home early.
Franny, where are you? The time machines are gone!
ratted out by the old lady.
harsh.
okay.
Yeah, beats working in an office every day.
Yeah, no kidding.
Hey! Want to see the one I'm most proud of?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no. That one.
it was our first real invention.
it's the one that started it all.
Wowie.
so if I go back now, then this will be my future.
well, that depends on you.
nothing is set in stone.
you gotta make the right choices and keep moving forward.
since it's gonna work this time, that means I...
we won't finally get to see what Mom looks like?
do we ever meet her?
I think you're just gonna have to get back to that science fair and find out for yourself.
I had a feeling you were gonna say that.
that's because we are one smart kid.
so long! - Bye-bye, Lewis!
farewell, future brother-in-law. - So long! See you later, Lewis!
Oh, don't forget the mashed potatoes!
have a safe trip, little Lewis. - I will.
Hey, while I got you here, just a couple of little suggestions regarding my design.
let's face it, these skinny limbs don't exactly make the teapot whistle.
all that really matters is, hey, don't forget to invent me.
are you kidding? No way! - I love you.
there's so many things I wish I could ask you.
excuse me. Time travel now, questions later.
but I... - Don't worry.
just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon.
Oh, right. Right, okay, I will. Bye.
goodbye, son. - Thanks again for everything!
wait. Lewis, one more thing. - Yeah?
just a little tip for the future. I am always right.
even when I'm wrong, I'm right.
she's right. I'd just go with it if I were you.
and I am.
then you're absolutely right.
all right, I'm coming.
well, it's not like you're never gonna see them again.
they are your family, after all.
wait a minute.
you're supposed to take me back to the science fair.
I know.
well, I think you punched in the wrong numbers.
we agreed that, if you fixed the time machine,
I'd take you back to see your mom.
what?
a deal's a deal.
I don't get it. Why'd you just let her go?
because I already have a family.
I never thought my dad would be my best friend.
now, now, don't make me come and bail you out again.
I won't.
remember, I've got a time machine.
if you mess up again, I'll just keep coming back till you get it right.
you got that motto? - I got it.
don't forget it.
I don't think that's possible.
you better get going.
see you later, Wilbur.
wait a minute!
Goob! Goob, wake up!
what?
that's it!
mr Willerstein, I know what went wrong.
can I have one more chance? Please!
my ride isn't here yet, so fire it up.
I need a volunteer.
now, just give me a date to input.
well, now, let's see.
there's my first science fair, the day I got my first microscope, the time I swam the English Channel, my first gold medal for the luge.
I know.
perfect!
you look gorgeous. - He's a lucky guy.
Oh! It works.
it works! - It works.
you look beautiful, Lucille.
bud?
would you look at that? - Whoa!
honey! Honey, you're just in time.
Lucille! - You did it, Lewis! You did it!
this invention is brilliant!
kid, you're this fair's MVP!
that was some show you put on.
you're a real special kid, but you don't look like a Lewis. You look more like a...
Cornelius. I get that a lot.
Oh, no! Sorry, mister.
no harm done.
Frankie, what have I told you about running away?
Frankie? - My star pupil.
my name's Franny, and I teach frogs music.
Really?
you know that frogs have more musical ability than people?
but nobody believes me.
they all think I'm crazy.
you think I'm crazy, too.
no. No, I think you're right.
over here? There he is.
kid, we'd like to get a story on you for the local paper.
you've got a bright future ahead of you.
let it go
Yeah.
let it roll right off your shoulder
don't you know
the hardest part is over
let it in
let your clarity define you
in the end
we will only just remember How it feels
let it slide
let your troubles fall behind you
let it shine
until you feel it all around you
and I don't mind
if it's me you need to turn to
we'll get by
it's the heart that really matters In the end
our lives are made
in these small hours
these little wonders
these twists and turns of fate
time falls away
but these small hours
these small hours still remain
all of my regret
will wash away somehow
but I cannot forget
the way I feel right now
around here...

waiting to cross the Rubicon

with one arm pointing And the other arm holding your hand?
needing a plan to keep you near
blowing a horn so you can hear
if it was only my love and devotion
this world would suddenly be In a state of
commotion
emotional commotion

I never get around Under the sun and the stars

you will turn around And I'll be

dude, dude, no, I was, like "yes, we do have nuclear missiles."
and he was all, like, "no, you don't."
and I was all, like, "yes, we do. whatever."
and then I was, like, "well, what part of 'whatever'
do you not get?
Josh? Josh?
how many times have I told you kids not to play ball in this alley?
mom! -Are you all right?
I'm fine. It wasn't a baseball. There was this thing!
it came from space! it almost hit me!
a thing came from space? -Yeah.
you have the biggest imagination, mister.
but... -Come here.
I'm glad you're all right. -But...
no buts. It's time to get ready for bed, please.
here. And don't walk over there until I pick up that glass, okay?
three months later
awesome.
Knox. Dooley.
got a report on some kind of fireball or something like that
over on liberty island. check it out.
no way. A fireball. cool. We'll get right on it.
Sarge, can't you get somebody else to handle it?
come on, we just pulled an all-nighter.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Knox.
tell you what.
lay down in my office and then I'll come by with your blankie
and you can get yourself a nice nap.
come on, it's gonna be great.
a fireball? How often do we get a call like that?
do me a favor, okay? Act like a cop and stop caring.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, are you all right?
Hello? Please don't be dead!
Oh, did you see that? He came out of nowhere!
it kind of looked like you sped up to hit him.
I was going for the parking spot! oh, my god.
Oh, jesus!
are you all right?
are you okay? hello? please say something.
Oh, my god, his foot! I'll call an ambulance!
Oh, god. please stay alive, please stay alive,
please stay alive. This is such bad karma from...
where did he go? -I don't know.
Mr. Guy?
this will take some time. -Copy that.
all clear.
repairs underway, sir.
damage report.
right arm, all well.
left arm, ready.
casualties, doctor? -Abrasions, contusions.
nothing significant, captain.
engineering?
running diagnostics, sir.
lieutenant buttocks, what is your status?
captain, we had a small gas leak.
it was silent, but not deadly.
well, crew, it seems our ship has survived the impact.
actually, diagnostics are not encouraging, captain.
this collision was unexpected so our impact shields weren't activated.
how long can we operate at full capacity?
forty-eight earth hours at most.
after that, system functions will fail.
and our tracking computer? -Down, sir.
that means we only have the last known coordinates of the orb.
it can be anywhere within 10, 000 square meters of our current location.
no. 2, options?
we could continue on the mission, sir but it's extremely risky.
the prudent course would be to return to our home planet
nil, and repair the ship.
assemble the crew.
ladies and gentlemen prepare for an address by your esteemed captain!
this is it. This is the moment that we've all been training for.
we all know what's at stake.
our planet is on the verge of a catastrophic energy crisis.
the device we sent to this world to drain its oceans
has been knocked off course and is lost somewhere in this city.
once it is found and deployed the salt from this world
shall power our home world for ages to come.
without it our people will perish in less than one generation.
I will not permit that to happen.
we must succeed.
for nil. -For nil.
for nil. -For nil.
back to your posts.
no. 3.
do we have sufficient linguistic information
to help communicate with these natives?
Yes. I tapped into their central planetary databank, named "google.
what a frivolous name for such a vital function.
well, if you prefer, there's another called "yahoo!
baffling.
what about... -Cultural and historical references?
already on it, captain. -Good.
no. 4, is security prepared? -Yes, sir.
my team can handle any threat
posed by these gargantuan savages.
good. -Initial reports confirm
that draining this planet's oceans
would have a catastrophic effect on existing life.
we have orders, no. 3. our entire home world is depending on us.
agreed.
we should not lament the fates of these inferior creatures.
if the orb has fallen into their hands,
who knows for what nefarious purpose they could be using it
at this very moment?
mom, there's a drunk guy in the alley again!
that's him. -Who?
the guy I just hit with my car. -You're kidding. again?
Oh, I barely clipped that other guy.
sir, coronal gas readings just spiked.
the orb must be nearby. -Hello?
Hello, sir, hi. hello? hi, there.
Hello, sir? Hi, are you all right? -Contact, everyone!
because you just ran off. -No. 17.
return to the ship. -Copy.
I'm worried. I really feel terrible about what just happened.
can I call you an ambulance or something?
any medical attention for... for your foot?
your foot.
our first verbal encounter.
thank you for your concern.
thank you for your concern.
it's way too high. more bass!
thank you for your concern.
level the frequency.
I'm all better now.
how hard did you hit this guy?
it's time for you to go to school before you're late, okay?
mom...
see how she squeezes the smaller one's skull despite his protests.
stop! stop! -Such brutality!
go on. Goodbye. -Stop!
Hey, safety first.
and if those boys are after you, you tell me!
I'm calling their parents. -Okay.
would you like to come upstairs
for a glass of water, maybe? anything?
I can help clean you up.
no, thank you. I am fine.
I am in position.
are you sure?
okay, but, see, that's not fine.
so, maybe you should come upstairs or I can call an ambulance.
sir, we cannot let her contact the authorities.
agreed. we will go in long enough to put her mind at ease.
Yes, I will accompany you.
thank you for your hospitality.
good.
the thing about my car is, you gotta pump the brakes.
I mean, I just got it back from the shop,
and I'm seriously considering suing my mechanic,
because that was just crazy about what happened.
Oh, sorry, right here! Oh, sorry, right here.
how you doing? -How are you?
good. good timing. I got something for you.
three tubes of cerulean blue.
I just ran out. -Hi. Mark Rhodes.
why does he thrust his arm towards us?
probably best to imitate him.
Hi. Mark Rhodes.
lefty, huh? hey.
all right. -All right.
all right. -All right.
okay.
thanks again. -Yeah.
we're going right inside. -All right, yeah.
okay, here you go.
sorry about the mess.
you know, this is sort of a workspace.
right arm. -this is unacceptable.
sorry! The liquid shifts the equilibrium!
I still seem to be a bit shaken up. -Oh, crap.
there, I feel much better now. -Oh, good! That is great.
great news. good.
so then, you don't need to call your lawyer or anything crazy like that
because that would be just pointless, wouldn't it?
good. Oh, I'm Gina, by the way.
Gina Morrison.
and you are?
three?
this is a list of the most common names on this planet.
my name is...
ming chang. -Ming chang?
sorry. sorry, you just struck me more like a Dave, or something.
which happens to be my other name.
Dave ming chang?
Dave ming chang.
Dave ming chang. All right, well, Dave,
I feel just terrible about this whole thing,
and I was gonna have some breakfast.
would you like to join me?
no, I really have to be going now. -Are you sure?
I mean, I sort of have a rule that when I hit somebody with my car
I need to make them breakfast.
that was a joke.
so where are you from? Do you live around here?
Yes, of course. I am just a regular person from right here on earth,
just like you.
I just don't get out that much.
Yeah, judging from your suit, I'd say since about 1978.
note, all-white apparel is not as standardized as we thought.
you late for a Bee Gees concert or something?
the Bee Gees.
Barry, Robin and Maurice, the brothers Gibb.
winning ten grammy awards and selling over 100, 000, 000 records.
Oh, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man no time to talk
Stayin'alive
Wow. that's impressive love for the Bee Gees, man.
I'm sorry, I had no idea. you know? Foot in the mouth.
listen, do you mind whipping these up for me?
that would be so great. just a little help.
I'm so used to making breakfast for Josh,
and all he wants is waffles.
anyway, he's off to school now.
Yeah, I don't know, he's got these bullies after him right now.
you don't have any kids, do you?
I mean, you don't really seem like a kid person, but...
anyway, I just, I try to be there for him,
but I don't really know how to deal with it, you know.
I'm just doing the single mom thing,
and I'm so permissive of everything.
Oh, my god, I am talking your ear off.
all is well. -Okay, why don't you just take a seat?
and I can finish this.
here, you like ketchup?
Oh, thank you. -You're welcome.
refreshing. I feel much better now.
that's a new one.
Oh, that's our cat, Boris. I hope you're not allergic.
are you?
cats. here we go, sir.
Boris, what are you up to?
captain. -Yes?
Yes, my husband was a captain with the navy.
I am a captain. -Really? a captain of what?
I am a captain of crunch.
where is your captain now? -Frank died four years ago,
so it's just me and Josh now.
it's been rough sometimes, but we're okay.
there is a strength to this one.
captain, the orb!
where was this image captured?
that's Josh at school, the science fair.
he always walks around with this thing.
see, he thinks it fell from outer space.
we must locate the boy. -We're on it, sir.
729 east 44th street.
I really have to be going now. Thank you for the ketchup.
okay. You know, the eggs are just another...
that's the closet.
sorry about hitting you with my car.
a couple of frat punks get drunk, miss the last ferry,
stick a rag in their bottle of stoli, and then, kaboom!
suddenly, my morning roll in the hay with tracy gets canceled.
I think this is explosive residue.
don't. don't do this, Dooley.
I see you getting interested in this.
I see that wacko x files gleam in your eye.
that might be the boy, there!
in that group of earth children.
what structure is this?
it appears to be some sort of shrine to technology.
this is the best they have to offer?
their mini-computers are gigantic!
and a slamming home page means more online buddies.
dude, while you're waiting, check these out.
awesome surround-sound headphones.
seven ounces, left and right quad.
the sound will blow you away.
is that insane?
it's like the subwoofers are actually inside your head.
damage reports coming in from all parts of the ship, captain!
sir! Structural integrity weakening!
we have got to get out of here!
the sign clearly indicates, "do not walk.
and yet, they keep walking and walking and walking!
apparently, chaos is the order of the day here.
doctor,
is two all right?
this is a big planet.
there might be contaminants we've never encountered before.
I'll keep an eye on it.
why don't you take a picture? It lasts longer.
it's the ice cream man!
ice cream man, over here!
ice cream! -Hey, look, it's the good humor man!
it's this suit again!
how in nil did we wind up with this wardrobe debacle?
we must have missed something. -I can't see how, sir.
we carefully studied the only signal ever intercepted from earth.
the plane! the plane!
when we enter the boy's school,
we must not draw any undue attention to ourselves.
Yes, we must rid ourselves of this inappropriate attire
and replace it with clothing that is
the epitome of both hip and now.
welcome to old navy!
any ideas? -Likely a ritual greeting, sir.
welcome to old navy!
welcome to old navy! -Welcome to old navy!
welcome to old navy!
welcome to old navy!
welcome to old navy.
welcome to old navy!
welcome to old navy.
can I help you find your size?
I am obviously the same size as everyone else.
I just meant are you a small, or...
I believe he simply wants to know the dimensions of your clothing.
Yes, you can help me find my size.
welcome to old navy.
crew, prepare for an unrehearsed maneuver.
come on!
what the... -Sorry, sir! it won't happen again!
I can help you if you'd... how about I help you take that.
very...
Yes, this is my size. welcome to old navy!
excuse me.
do you have a private chamber where I can try on these garments?
changing room back there behind hoodies.
welcome to old navy.
sir, we have arrived at the school.
this can't be right.
one singular sensation every little step she takes
apologies, sir.
apparently we are on west 44th street.
one smile and suddenly nobody else will do
let's get out of here. double-time.
what do you got here, little freak?
that's mine! -What do you use it for, playing nerd-ball?
whatever it is, it's mine now. - give it back!
or what? you gonna tell your mommy again?
can I help you?
I am here for the fifth-grade classroom.
okay, all right, you're very late, but you're here, at least.
it's been a madhouse. half the teachers are out with the flu.
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to throw you to the wolves.
don't say a word. I will mess you up.
Josh Morrison.
what are you doing here? Are you the sub?
you would know the sub, loser!
I don't know him! My mom hit him with her van!
I am Dave ming chang, the sub.
what is your name?
Smellmy. -Smellmy what?
Smellmy buttcrack.
I am sure the other buttcracks would disapprove of your behavior.
you don't look like a teacher.
I'm going to report you.
vaporize the child at once! -Delay that order.
I am indeed your temporary instructor,
which I shall prove to you now.
observe.
let's teach them something simple, shall we?
what the...
the unified field theory.
the ultimate pearl of wisdom in all of the universe.
now you are educated.
what is your destination? -I'm gonna sharpen my pencil.
here, let me assist you.
there. -Thanks, I think.
Josh Morrison. Come with me.
what are you doing here? you're not really the sub, are you?
you have something that is mine.
it is a small spherical device, 2. 7 inches in diameter.
how'd you hear about that?
and how can it be yours if it came from outer space?
are you an alien?
we've been compromised!
I'm just messing with you.
that's very funny. it's very important that I find it.
do you know where it is?
let me guess. it's, like, top secret or something.
Yes. it is top secret or something.
will you help us, I mean me, find it?
look, I don't have it anymore. this jerk took it.
well, we have to get it back.
where is this jerk? -His name is Rich.
him and his buddies are probably headed for the deli.
lead and I will follow. -Okay, come on.
such disturbing images.
rich isn't here. -Do you know where Rich lives?
no, but sometimes I run into him in the neighborhood.
everybody on the floor, now!
empty the register and no one gets hurt.
this planet continues to reveal its ugly nature.
it deserves its fate.
I said, on the floor, now! -I am already on the floor.
gravity prevents me from floating off of it.
get down now!
big mistake, man.
Hey, you have forgotten your weapon!
Dave, wait!
that was awesome! I mean,
you totally threw that guy across the room.
I was very fortunate not to be injured.
and the gun. no normal person could have done that.
do you have, like, superpowers or something?
do you know what would be very pleasant?
if we were to change the subject of our conversation.
did you see last night's sports competition?
you see? There's another thing. You talk so weird.
come on, tell me, what's your secret? -I have no secret.
Oh, yeah? Quick, where are you from?
I am from right here in this city.
where exactly? Give me an address.
the statue of liberty.
you live at the statue of liberty?
Yes,
the ming changs have lived
at the statue of liberty for many generations.
now, let us locate the orb.
look, I don't know where Rich is now,
but tomorrow's my mom's birthday.
we're going to our neighborhood street fair. everybody goes.
I'm sure he's gonna be there.
you know, if you want, you could come with me and my mom.
sir, we can't wait until tomorrow. Our power supply is dwindling.
this child is useless. We must find the orb on our own.
I disagree. Without guidance, we might not find it in time.
contrary to expectations, Josh has been quite helpful to us.
we will stick with him.
man, you are awesome at this!
it's like you've got super video-game powers, too.
are you sure you're not a superhero? -Absolutely.
fine, I give up.
I'm just happy to be able to play with somebody besides mom.
interacting with your mother makes you unhappy?
Nah, I don't mean to complain. she tries.
it's just that dad was a lot better.
you know, my dad was a hero in real life.
he saved, like, a million people one time.
that is impressive.
Yeah, we miss him. especially mom.
now she spends all her time smothering me.
she cuts off your air supply? -Josh, I'm home!
Oh, hey! what are you doing back here?
some guys with a gun tried to rob the store,
and Dave stopped them and saved everyone!
it was awesome! -What? what gun?
mom, mom. -Are you all right?
mom, I'm fine! it was so cool! Dave just took them out.
man, I wish I could do that. But look at me.
I'm the smallest fifth-grader in New York city.
you are not small. You are a giant. -Yeah, right.
Josh, the most powerful force in all the universe
often comes from the smallest star.
Dave? would you like to stay for supper?
sir, the longer we're in their presence,
the greater the danger of exposure.
Yes, I will stay.
good.
although, if you thought my driving was dangerous,
wait till you try my meatloaf.
meat loaf?
what are you looking for? -I don't know.
I'll tell you when I find it.
you know something, Dooley? We gotta find you a new hobby.
Stevie, please just hold the insult.
please.
Oh, I forgot today was arts and crafts day.
Dave, would you mind helping me clear the table?
you know, don't worry about it. I got it. I'm...
this is something I do all the time.
I'm constantly dropping stuff. Don't even worry about it.
men are from mars, women are from venus.
Yeah, that's my...
I would... my sister got that for me. I would never...
she just thinks I need to get back in the game, and...
tell your sister there is no life on mars! Believe me.
okay.
this rendering. What is it?
that's just something I felt.
you felt this. -Yeah, I did.
I did. I don't really paint like that anymore.
and why not?
well, things have changed.
and what is the feeling demonstrated here?
well, how does it make you feel?
feel?
it makes me feel off-balance.
off-balance, yeah.
that's... that's close.
I remember when I painted this, I just felt love.
huge and exciting and crazy,
just love.
how do you know when you feel love?
Oh, I think when you feel love,
you don't need to ask that question.
I see.
time for me to exit into the night.
okay.
well, thank you again for being there for Josh today and...
and, yeah, I think tomorrow will be fun.
I'm glad you're coming with us.
so am I, Gina Morrison.
okay.
good night, Dave. -Good night, Gina.
do you mind if I rest here?
sure.
this appears to be a safe port. We'll join this urban camper.
you ain't crazy, are you?
the last guy was here, he said he was from outer space.
what planet?
and the party continues.
here. Here you go. Gets a little chilly at night.
did you see that?
this man has nothing,
yet he offers to share his sole source of warmth.
Why?
it seems they are a more complex species than we imagined.
yes? -My findings are incomplete,
but I have noted more atypical behavior
spreading throughout the ship.
is that so?
well, I think we all just need a good night's rest, doctor.
dang! - excuse me?
working rather late, No. 3.
I was just doing some additional cultural research.
and what have you found?
I stumbled onto an interesting file in the alien database, sir.
every man, woman and child is forced to view it once a year.
it could be helpful in understanding them.
show me.
you have not changed since our days at the academy.
I remember the late nights studying together.
and the nutritious protein squares you prepared for us.
I would not have been able to graduate without your help.
and, yet, here you've become our
generation's most renowned captain.
Yes.
here it is.
what is it you want, mary? What do you want?
you want the moon? Just say the word
and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, mary.
I'll take it.
lasso the moon?
physically impossible! -Absurd.
good night, captain. -Yes, three, good night.
I must say, sir, these earth creatures keep surprising me.
a most confusing place. It makes my head spin.
I guess I'd better hold on, then.
I want to send this out to every precinct every security company
and every hospital in the city until we id this guy right here.
this is incredible. Just amazing.
amazing that two idiots like you could've passed the police exam.
see? I tried to tell him, sarge. -Hold on.
it is a fact, a fact that something or someone has landed here.
now, we could be making the biggest scientific discovery of all time.
I don't want to hear another word about
E. t. bigfoot or the tooth fairy,
unless they're jacking some old lady's car.
you got that? -Yes, sir.
that's good aim, sarge. -Shut up!
Dooley. What are you doing?
I'm sending it anyway, Knox.
no, it's just a guy who shoved his face in the dirt.
no, wrong. It is an alien,
an alien who shoved his face in the dirt, and I am gonna find him.
that only gives us about 12 hours.
then every minute counts. Remember our mission, crew.
we must find the boy with the orb. No distractions.
this is not acceptable!
and here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
Chuck starts off fast out of the gate, eating down those dogs,
but Earl and Homer are right behind him.
look at them go! Look at them go!
come on, Dave, eat! -Dave, just put it in your mouth!
what are you doing? Eat it!
just put one in your mouth, Dave!
put it in, come on, now! -Dave! Dave, eat!
you never should have signed him up for this.
what are you doing, Dave? eat!
eat it, Dave! Put it in your mouth!
Yeah, all right! Yeah! Yeah!
a little heads-up might be nice!
Hey! can a brother get some hot sauce with that?
look at him go!
our champion! eighty-five delicious all-beef hot dogs!
Yeah!
Yeah, boy! Yeah!
well executed, captain.
Dave, that was amazing! You are a wiener-eating champ!
and here's the grand prize.
we're under attack!
it's the creature from thanos 7! Battle stations!
you have menaced us for the last time, you beast!
it seems that this is an inanimate creature.
at ease!
the question is, what are we expected to do with this plush amphibian?
give it to her, captain.
the female. Give it to her.
silly goose.
you are such a goofball.
for me? Thanks, Dave. That was...
that's very sweet.
red alert, captain! Red alert!
we need to dispose of the large quantity of processed meat tubes!
excuse me.
my colon is impacted.
okay.
show-off!
excuse me! Excuse me, we met yesterday.
mark Rhodes. -Mark Rhodes?
right. the left again. -Yeah.
so, you here by yourself? -No, I am not.
I am accompanying Josh and Gina.
all evening we have been screaming with fear and delight.
look, you and I should get something straight,
and I'm not trying to step on your toes, here.
if you're serious about Gina, then that's great,
because she deserves a decent guy in her life,
but if I find out that you're just trying to take advantage of her,
and you're using Josh to do it,
you and I are gonna have a serious problem.
you understand what I'm saying?
Yes, I understand completely, Mark Rhodes.
does anyone here understand what this man is talking about?
he's trying to discern if you intend on becoming Gina's mate.
what an absurd notion!
I intend on becoming Gina's mate?
she's the size of our science pavilion.
these primitive creatures and their silly speculations!
wait! What's that?
what do you want, midget?
rich, you gotta give me my rock back.
Oh, really? Why?
because it's really important to me and my friend, Dave.
it's the jerk we seek!
rich, you've gotta give me my rock back!
boy, it's like you're asking me to punch you!
so, smellmy, we meet again.
Dave.
stop! You're giving me a wedgie!
stop! Please put me down, already!
smellmy, are you crying because you are sad
or because your undergarments are lodged
so cuttingly deep in your rectum?
I'm telling my mom.
mom! mom!
Dave, that was unbelievable! High-five!
they don't high-five where you're from?
no, but they should. -There you two are!
what kind of trouble you getting into?
nothing. Dave was just about to try out his pitching arm!
come on, Dave. -Go, Dave! Go, Dave!
you just gotta hit three. Here we go.
come on! Come on, come on!
go, Dave! go, Dave!
sir, the orb is ours. This charade is no longer necessary.
it's time to throw it in the ocean and head home.
you're absolutely right, two,
but I really think I can do this.
he looks very serious.
looking good. Come on, you can do it!
here we go. He's gonna do it!
wind up!
all right, well...
spectacularly unsuccessful! Why was my wrist so limp?
I was in the bathroom.
on my command.
come on, you can hit it. -Two more. Come on.
come on. Come on.
fire!
incoming!
engineer, report!
all sensors are down and the sun shields deployed upon impact.
sir, we're blacked out.
the sun is exploding in my face!
I still haven't got a pulse. Give me the paddles, stat.
Oh, god. Don't watch. -Clear!
come on. Give me more juice.
clear!
power has been restored.
Oh, thank god! Oh, god, is he gonna be okay?
we'll do an mri just to be safe.
he's okay. He's okay.
how we doing? I have to warm it up first,
but just to double-check
they took your keys, watch, coins?
Yes. -Good.
cause people always forget the "m" in mri stands for "magnetic.
this'll just take a second.
I guess I still have a few pennies.
I'm so sorry to have ruined your birthday.
thanks for letting the cat out of the bag.
cat? Where's the cat? -You know, it's okay,
because I'm not really one for celebrating anyway.
well, perhaps you will reconsider
and let us take you out for dinner.
Yeah.
sir, with all due respect, have you lost your mind?
they've helped us. The least we can do is try to help them.
you have become a fool!
treating these lumbering giants as if they're our equals.
you've made a mockery of our entire mission!
you get out of my face. Now!
Dave?
Dave? hello?
right here. -Hey, where'd you go?
I am here.
I'm so curious sometimes what's going on in that head of yours.
I was just pondering which would be the best place to take you
to commemorate your birthday.
Josh, do you have any suggestions?
perhaps a nice cuban place?
I know a great salsa restaurant.
all right, well, let's go party
everyone! We're going to go and party!
okay, three mojitos, one virgin.
thank you. -You're welcome.
thank you. -Here you go. You enjoy.
Cheers. -Happy birthday, mom.
thank you.
now, careful. These go straight to your head.
this is not acceptable!
slow down, cowboy.
this is the best!
Cougar46 just added me as a friend.
Yeah! -Yeah!
he walked out about an hour ago
with a nice-looking lady and a kid.
Oh, really? Nice-iooking? She pretty hot? -Please! Please.
you sure it's him? -Absolutely.
said they were going to a cuban salsa place.
you gotta try this.
it's like space travel, only in your head.
I've been having strange feelings since we've arrived on this planet.
it seems you are, too? -Absolutely not.
if you'll excuse me, I'm recalibrating our weapon systems.
just a second.
exactly what weapon are you recalibrating?
okay, let's talk.
I'm feeling a little busted.
you know, pretty soon you're gonna be too old to dance with your mom.
excuse me while I run to the restroom.
Josh.
I will be going home soon.
what is the matter with you?
when you're gone, everything's just gonna
go back to the way it was.
I'm not like other kids.
I can't even fight for myself.
my dad was a hero.
but me?
I'm just different.
Josh, listen to me.
we would never have been able to find the orb without you.
not everyone would have helped us, but you did.
because you are different.
I am very lucky to have a friend like you.
you're just saying that. -No, I am not.
you have helped us greatly. We are all in great debt to you.
I did?
Yes. We are saved, Josh.
she thinks she's so hot.
she's not hot. Have you seen her butt?
it's like the size of our moon. -You are so bad.
bad and gorgeous!
okay, another one. I took the liberty.
I love this song.
need anything, captain?
Yes, I may need some music references for...
Dave, will you do me the honor?
come on!
it'll be fun.
Yes, yes, I would, I'd love to dance with you.
you're gonna love it!
here, it's really easy. Just let the music take you.
all hands, stay alert, and obey my commands to the letter.
captain, might I have a word? -Make it brief.
there are emotional dangers on this planet we did not foresee.
we are on the brink of anarchy.
not now. I'm trying to let the music take me!
all right, crew, everyone, let's get it together, now!
all together!
precision!
right foot! Left foot!
okay. Here, just follow my lead.
we should be fulfilling our mission trying to save our planet
not leaping around like some sort of idiot,
attempting to woo a gigantic strumpet!
this captain has become a joke.
this is over the line, sir.
the captain still deserves our respect.
shake my hips like this! More hips! Hips!
Yes, That's it! more hips! Look, I'm dancing!
all right, I'm in.
the dancing stops now.
here, here. Hand here. Okay?
I need more wiggle in the posterior region!
captain, if I may?
you think that you can do better?
nothing personal, sir, but that won't be hard.
take charge.
okay, boys and girls, everybody listen up!
you're gonna give me a basic,
stepping forward with the left and back with the right.
don't bounce, and do not over think it.
we're gonna put your accoutrements right up against her.
drop down.
this is salsa, people. Let's make it spicy!
follow me!
I knew you were holding out on me.
come on, come on, girl.
I'm about to show you how to do the forbidden dance.
it's my birthday!
and dip her, like a cookie in milk.
I feel good. I feel loose. I feel good.
Freeze!
everybody, stay calm. -Hands up. hands up!
should we power up blasters?
no.
too many innocent civilians.
easy, folks, easy.
step back, please. -Dave?
Hey, welcome to earth.
greetings.
we don't want to hurt you.
we don't want to hurt you.
we're you're friends.
all we want to know is why you've come down to our planet.
Oh, for god sake.
stay calm. They can't prove anything.
what is your purpose here?
what is your purpose here?
the mystery is what your purpose here is.
okay, you know what?
I'm trying to do a thing, and you're not helping me out,
so please stop.
Greetings!
no. 2, what are you doing?
you can't do this, two. -Excuse me?
we're playing by my rules now, ex-captain!
seize him!
you cannot do this, no. 2! -Can, and will.
you brought this on yourself.
what are we supposed to do?
you do what you took an oath to do and protect me, your captain, four.
stay back, four. I don't want to see anyone get hurt.
you'll never get away with this, two.
the rest of the crew will not support you!
Oh, yes, they will. Because they have a mission to complete.
three, you're supporting this?
Yes, I see no other way.
that's because there is no other way.
whoa, who left the speaker on?
shut that off!
officer dooley, can I speak to you outside?
just for a minute.
you will regret this.
something has been awakened in all of us.
something you will never be able to stop.
looks like I just did. confine him to his quarters!
attention, crew! As of this moment,
Un-nilian behavior will no longer be permitted.
in fact, it will be punished.
severely.
a new era has begun, with me as your leader.
you know, we just met him a couple days ago,
like I've said five times.
you guys all right
Yes. It's been a long night.
what do they want with him? -I don't know.
he didn't do anything wrong!
stand and engage blasters!
sir?
I gave you an order.
Yes, sir.
did you not just hear those voices?
Yes, I heard the voices.
wow, we got a nutjob living in New York city.
what are the odds?
so what are you saying? We should just let him go?
Yes, I think we should let him go!
that's exactly what I'm saying!
that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my entire life!
activate heat shields.
Freeze! -Look out!
this guy's crazy! Somebody about to get killed!
I'm out! Son of a...
take cover!
you, woman and child,
you have wasted enough time with your pathetic emotional distractions.
Dave?
your undisciplined human frailty causes nothing but chaos!
and one other thing, your so-called artwork
is both pretentious and sophomoric.
I could do this all day.
Freeze!
three, find me the fastest route to the landing site.
three, I...
guards!
no. 12! Have you been working out?
you can tell?
no.
Yes.
thank you, three. -I didn't do this to help you.
I did this to stop that lunatic!
what have I done to hurt you so?
you really can't be that oblivious!
listen to me. Whatever I have done to hurt you, I apologize,
but right now we have to get to the engine room -And shut down the ship! -Fine! Let's just go.
what in nil is your problem?
are you all right, Josh?
mom, I'm fine, but something's wrong. That can't be Dave!
you have to trust me. We need to go after him.
no, Josh, we're not doing that.
I know you want to protect me. -Of course.
but Dave is my friend, and I need to protect him right now.
Josh. -If we don't help him,
something terrible's gonna happen. I know it!
I was just making conversation to ease the apparent tension between us.
don't. You're making it worse. -You know what...
no. 3, didn't take you long to betray me.
this is not the answer, two!
you weren't nilian enough to do your duty, -So you left me no choice. -Listen to reason.
we thought that earth was not worth preserving.
we were wrong.
there's much we've learned from this place.
we must not hurt these people! -Yes, we must!
and since you two seem to love these gargantuan beasts so much
have fun living among them.
I have a little tickle in my nose.
follow me! -No, follow me!
three, I'm so sorry that you're out here with me.
not half as sorry as I am!
please, we'll have the entire journey back home to argue.
this may not be the best spot, sir. -And why not?
mother of nil!
three!
I'm coming, three. Don't move. -Great advice, captain.
because I can't!
are you all right, three?
please! you have no concern for me.
all you care about is Gina, your big, fat girlfriend!
you think that she's fat?
if she wears a size infinity,
then she's fat!
it takes me almost getting run over for you to even notice me!
I'm practically invisible to you!
invisible? Quite the opposite.
when I look at you, what I see is
the ship!
I love New York. let's go!
trust me, three. Jump!
it's working!
you see? Just as I planned!
look, if we let go at precisely the right moment,
we'll be propelled to the ship.
on three.
one, two, three!
three.
I asked for you to be assigned to this mission
because you are kind, intelligent and beautiful, more so than anyone I've ever known in my life.
and without you,
I would be nothing.
why have you never spoken to me of this before?
because I was too nilian to express it.
I should have lassoed the moon for you long ago.
but now let's turn the ship around.
we'll never get there at this rate.
give me full power to the legs!
I told you. Our power is nearly depleted.
crew, prepare to hail a cab!
Taxi!
what? An alien cannot get a cab in this town?
Hey, buddy! This is my cab! What are you doing?
liberty island ferry. Make haste or die.
Yes, every available cop in the city, and the feds.
I knew it. I knew it, I knew it!
I knew we were not alone in this universe.
look, I'm not convinced he's an alien. -Oh, you're not?
so what? -So what? so, who you calling?
homeland security. -Don't do that.
they're gonna overreact!
we don't even know why he's visiting yet.
well, it's obviously not a peace mission!
get those big slobbery lips away from me!
and while you suckers are sitting here talking,
he about to go suck your planet dry!
I need somebody from homeland security, please.
I don't have the extension.
are you with Dave? -No.
no, no. I come free with a venti latte.
of course I'm with dave, stupid!
I need... hey, you got a comment? - no.
I need the extension from you guys because I don't have it.
do you know where he went? -Yes, I do.
I need a ride, though.
okay. -Well, what you waiting for?
okay.
wait, wait, wait.
don't be shaking me.
sorry. I apologize.
don't be blowing on me! I don't know you that well!
slow down. slow. wait. I said slow down now!
wait, it's dark in here. I'm in.
please, hurry. Dooley, where you going?
Hey, sarge, you got a little schmutz right here.
shut up!
how many tickets you got?
I've never been caught speeding.
in new york. This year.
long live nil.
sorry, Earth. Sometimes no. 2 happens!
captain! Thank goodness you're back.
no. 2's become a raging lunatic.
not to worry, kind friend. I'm back, and I'm taking over.
welcome, captain.
right arm!
what the devil is this? -Someone's overriding the system!
only the captain has the code to...
the captain!
you are in my chair!
guards!
put down your weapons. -Seize him!
guards, I said seize him!
you've seen what a fool he's been!
we all know I am the only one qualified to get us home.
is this what you want? This chaos?
we choose our captain.
this planet rocks. Deal with it.
get out of my chair.
captain, the orb is in the water.
the siphoning process is getting stronger by the minute.
right arm, summon the orb.
captain, the fight drained our power blow one percent
I can re-route booster energy but there won't be enough for take-off.
well, captain, it seems you have a choice.
save this planet or save yourself.
I choose this planet.
and what of your beloved crew?
are you willing to condemn them to the same fate?
stranded here in a world of behemoths?
I believe it is the right thing to do,
but I cannot make this decision for all of you.
I say we save earth.
and its moon.
my life began on this planet.
I no longer feel like no. 3.
I am Dave Ming Chang.
I have 443 new friends on myspace
and a jdate next week with a woman named Sheila Moskowitz.
I am Dave Ming Chang.
I am Dave Ming Chang.
I am Dave Ming Chang. - I am Dave Ming Chang.
I am Dave Ming Chang. - I am Dave Ming Chang.
I am Johnny Dazzles, and I am Fabulous!
what? Not everybody has to be dave ming chang.
you've all gone completely mad!
take him and put him
in my butt.
engineer, divert all remaining power to right arm.
way to go, right arm!
Dave! Are you okay?
Dave! What is happening? How can we help you?
thank you, but it is too late.
we are out of power.
we'll never get back now. It is over.
hands behind your head! Understand?
step away from that thing!
No! -Hey! Let us handle this, folks, okay?
you don't need your guns, all right? Don't hurt him!
we're not gonna hurt anybody.
we're just gonna talk. -Dooley, enough!
you've seen what that thing can do.
hands behind your head!
captain, with no shield and no power,
the projectile from his weapon will breach the hull.
we'll take casualties.
he can't move! He doesn't have any power left!
hands behind your head! -He can't move!
Josh! -Kid!
Josh!
we have power. We have been saved.
all hail Josh the hero!
stay right where you are!
if you're trying to freak me out, it's not gonna work.
all right, that's gonna freak me out a little. Do you see that?
I do. -Is that a guy?
looks like it. -Like a really little guy?
like a really little guy. -On his tongue?
What'd I just say?
hello. -You, you see that, right?
there's a little guy in there? -He's talking.
Yeah. -Dave.
I apologize to all of you.
it was my second-in-command who took control of my ship by force
and it was he, not i
who performed these unspeakable acts of cruelty.
will you put that thing down? Would you please?
I mean, the guy's an inch tall. You look like a wuss. Right?
Josh, my friend. You helped save two worlds today.
and you taught me the true meaning of friendship and courage.
your father would have been proud of his young captain.
promise me you'll always take pride in being different.
I promise. -High-five.
perhaps that's not such a great idea.
Gina. -Yeah. Yeah, hi.
you're, you're really tiny.
and I should have known you were an alien,
because no straight man is that good a dancer.
I think I'm finally able to understand
how your painting makes me feel.
I feel love.
okay, I guess she's not that fat. -Told you.
Hey! man! hey, don't forget about me!
Yeah! I'm not trying to stay in here!
you squeezing my brain!
you're gonna make it pop! stop! -I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey, slow down. I don't want you messing up my sexy.
okay. easy. Almost, almost, almost, almost.
okay.
Hey! yeah. yeah, that, that look good.
time for us to go home.
I'll miss you, Dave. -And I you.
remember, I'll never be that far away,
good friend.
a little room, please.
what? No!
Dave!
FBI! -Out of the way!
move, move, move!
No! -Hey, what is going on?
mom, look!
he's okay.
I didn't think we'd make it out of there.
good thing you have such big feet, captain.
we'll have much to explain when we return home.
we'll find another way to save nil.
there are plenty of worlds out there for us to explore.
Yes, no. 3.
but what we learned on earth
is more valuable than all the salt in the galaxy.
and when we do return it looks like I'll be needing a new no. 2.
I think you'll be needing more than that.
Yeah, captain! get in there, captain!
cue the new anthem.
meet The Robinsons
then I didn't choose that one because it was gonna give me pimples, so I choosed another scary one because, for all those years that I went for Halloween,
I wasn't scary at all.
I love baseball. It's my destiny to play that game.
I don't really care about winning.
well, like, now I do 'cause, like, we've lost every game.
I've gotten tired of it.
I'm working, like, so hard. All the balls are getting thrown to me.
I'm trying to catch, like, every one.
all of the people in the outfield are all looking around and...
come on! Let's play some baseball, okay?
not the lazy game.
they're here.
Lewis?
Lewis?
Goob! Hey, I did it, Goob! I finished it!
they are gonna love this!
nothing says "adopt me" like a weird invention.
Lewis!
Lewis, the Harringtons are here! - Way ahead of you, Mildred.
wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.
remember, sit up straight. Look them in the eye.
smile. Let's fix your...
Mildred.
all right, all right, all right, all right.
go show them how special you are.
Oh, I hope this is it.
I hope he gets adopted.
you and me both, chief.
I mean, there's so many things in the world that can be improved.
just think of it. Moving sidewalks, flying cars.
the possibilities are endless.
flying cars? Yeah, that's a good one.
all it takes is some imagination and a little science, and we can make the world a better place.
well, these are all interesting ideas.
so, what's your favourite sport?
well, does inventing count as a sport? - Actually...
cause I think I hit a home run with this one!
what is that? - First, a question.
what's the number one problem that you face when you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Lewis, I don't think we... - Portion control.
too much peanut butter sticks to the roof of your mouth, takes forever to chew.
too much jelly squishes out the sides and makes your hands all sticky.
well, I propose that the perfect P. B. and J.
is within mankind's grasp, and I've built this machine to achieve it.
for this demonstration, I'll use regular bread.
honey, it's okay.
as you can see, toasting is an option.
we don't usually eat peanut butter.
Lewis, this is really not necessary.
it's jammed!
Lewis, please, don't!
what's happening?
mr Harrington has a peanut allergy!
I'm sorry!
here let me help you get that off!
stand back!
is he gonna be okay? - Breathe. Breathe.
I'm so sorry! I didn't know!
it was really nice to meet you.
we're gonna need some time to think about it.
Hi, folks. Everything all...
what happened?
miss Duffy, that boy is definitely not right for us.
now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm so sorry about this. If you would just...
I made some lunch. - Not hungry.
poor Mr Harrington.
I killed him? - No. No! No, you didn't kill him.
I called. He's perfectly fine.
I was just gonna say that it's...
it's too bad he didn't get to try a sandwich from that wonderful invention of yours.
Yeah, real wonderful. - It's not you.
we just haven't found the right couple yet.
one hundred twenty-four.
what?
that's how many adoption interviews I've had, 124.
Oh, Lewis, come on, now.
you're exaggerating just to make your point.
Plus, I'm gonna be 13 next year, and you know how hard it is for a teenager to get adopted.
I have no future. No one wants me.
that's not true, Lewis!
my own mother didn't even want me.
now, stop it. You do not know that.
then why'd she give me up?
she may not have been able to take care of you.
did you ever think of that?
I am sure that she was only thinking about what was best for you.
I never thought of it that way.
maybe she wanted to keep you, but she had no choice.
you're right.
my real mom is the only person who's ever wanted me.
wait. I said "maybe.
and if she wanted me then, she'll want me now.
what are you talking about?
I have to find her, Mildred, and when I do, she'll take me back, and we'll be a family again!
whoa, whoa, whoa! Lewis, you can't do that.
no one knows anything about her. No one even saw her.
wrong. I saw her once.
she's in here. I just have to remember.
that's it!
hello
I got something to tell you
but it's crazy
I got something to show you
so give me just one more chance
one more glance and I will make of you
another believer
guess what? You got more than you bargained
ain't it crazy?
you got more than you paid for
so give me just one more chance
one more glance
one more hand to hold
you've been on my mind
though it may seem I'm fooling
wasted so much time
though it may seem I'm fooling
what are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do?
what are we gonna do about it?
you've been on my mind
one more chance
wasted so much time
one more chance
so tired.
we'll see you at 2: 00 this afternoon. He'll be so excited you're coming.
Bye-bye, now.
Yes! Hey, Goob... I mean, Michael.
good luck at the big game today. - Easy win.
those guys are a bunch of bums.
I just hope I can stay awake.
don't tell me. Let me guess.
he was up all night working on his stupid project, but that's what happens when you get a science geek for a roommate.
Ah, that's good joe.
all right, Einstein, you owe Michael big time.
well, unlocking the secrets of the brain took a lot longer than I expected, but it's finished, Mildred. I recalibrated the headset.
now the neural circuits will connect.
I've cracked the hippocampus!
Really? Okay. What?
now to test it out.
Oh, no! I'm late! I gotta go!
wait a minute, Lewis. Wait a minute.
I almost forgot what I came up here for.
I know you have a lot on your plate today, but I've scheduled an interview for you this afternoon.
no, thanks. - "No, thanks"?
sweetheart, this is about being adopted, and you will be back here clean, happy and on time.
I'm done with interviews, Mildred. I'm not gonna be rejected anymore.
listen, I know where your head is, but I'm telling you, you have got to get out of the past and look to the future.
I am, and this is it.
this is my future.
I'm sorry.
Lewis? Honey?
dr Krunklehorn, I know you're very busy there at Inventco Labs, and we're just so excited to have you as a judge.
it's my pleasure, Mr Willerstein. Hey, you never know.
one of your students may invent the next integrated circuit or microprocessor or integrated circuit.
Oh, wait! I said that already.
well, I just don't get out of that lab very much.
is that a bow tie? I like bow ties.
I haven't slept in eight days!
well, then can I get you a cot or something?
Nope, I've got the caffeine patch. It's my invention.
each patch is the equivalent of 12 cups of coffee.
you can stay awake for days with no side effects.
sorry. Who's this?
this is one of our students, Stanley Pukowski.
Oh, so cute!
I just want to bite his chubby little cheeks!
what's with the dress, Pukowski?
it's actually a toga, sir.
coach, nice to see you, sort of. What are you doing here?
judging a science fair. What's it look like I'm doing?
and what makes you qualified to judge a science fair?
it's my gym.
Stanley. Volcano.
behold the awesome power of Mount Vesuvius!
the toggle switch isn't toggling.
dr Krunklehorn?
barium, cobalt, Einstein, Kool-Aid!
I don't know what she just said, but this project is unacceptable!
now, give me 20 laps around the gym!
move it! Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go!
coach! - I'm watching you.
okay, next up is Lizzy and her fire ant farm.
that's right.
Lizzy, we talked about the fire ants.
you know that they have a tendency to bite people.
only my enemies.
just keep moving, shall we? Top notch, Lizzy!
let's not anger her or make her jumpy in any way.
this area's not secure. Get in.
have you been approached by a tall man in a bowler hat?
what? - Hey, hey, I'll ask the questions here.
okay, goodbye. - All right, didn't want to pull rank on you, but you forced my hand.
special Agent Wilbur Robinson of the T. C.T. F.
the what? - Time Continuum Task Force.
I'm here to protect you. - Well...
now, tall man, bowler hat, approached you?
no, why?
I could lose my badge for this.
he's a suspect in a robbery.
what did he steal?
a time machine. - A what?
I've tracked him to this time, and my informants say he's after you.
me? Why me?
the boys back at HQ haven't figured out a motive yet.
and by "HQ," I mean "headquarters.
I know what HQ means.
good. You're a smart kid.
that might keep you alive, for now.
just worry about your little science gizmo and leave the "perp" to me.
and by "perp," I mean... - I know what it means!
okay, Mr Smarty-pants.
bowler Hat Guy!
my frogs!
you're not gonna get away with it, kid with science project.
dude, you almost busted my solar system!
my frogs! They're getting away!
got you! That's the last of them.
annoying little girl, I don't have time for this.
I'm on a very important...
don't sass me, boy. I know karate.
come on, Pukowski! Feel the pain! Love the pain!
coach...
next up is Lewis.
yes... Lewis! Excuse me.
Lewis, tell me this thing is not gonna...
it's okay. It's gonna work this time. I won't let you down, I promise.
all right, Lewis, I trust you. Knock 'em dead.
that was a figure of speech. Please don't kill anyone.
okay, stand back, everybody.
this next project will knock your socks off.
seriously, you might wanna stand back a little.
have you ever forgotten something, and no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't remember it?
well, what happens to these forgotten memories?
I propose they're stored somewhere in your brain, and I built a machine that can retrieve them.
I call it the Memory Scanner.
it's shiny!
so, Lewis, how does the Memory Scanner work?
first, you input the desired period of time on this keypad.
then a laser scans the cerebral cortex, where memories are stored.
the retrieved memory is then displayed on this monitor.
wrap him up. I'll take two.
now, I'm going back 12 years, three months and 11 days.
why that particular day?
you didn't think I was paying attention, did you?
well, that was the day...
let's just say, that was a very important day in my life.
fair enough. Play ball.
it'll just take a second to get the turbines going.
Lewis, wait!
she's gonna blow!
watch out!
feel the pain! Love the...
hurts so much! Make it stop!
make it stop!
coach, suck it up, okay?
let us conduct ourselves in a way that we'll all be proud of tomorrow.
I didn't mean to... - Not now, Lewis!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
not now.
okay, and we are walking in a calm, orderly fashion toward the exits.
wait, Lewis!
come, my dear. Our future awaits.
Hey, what are you doing up here?
would you quit that, please? I know you're not a pigeon.
you're blowing my cover.
we're the only ones up here.
that's just what they want you to think.
now, enough moping.
take this back to the science fair and fix that Memory Scanner.
stop! Stop! Get away from me!
maybe you've forgotten.
I'm a time cop from the future, should be taken very seriously.
that's no badge.
this is a coupon for a tanning salon! You're a fake.
okay, you got me. I'm not a cop, but I really am from the future, and there really is this Bowler Hat Guy.
here we go again.
he stole a time machine, came to the science fair and ruined your project.
my project didn't work because I'm no good.
there is no Bowler Hat Guy, there is no time machine, and you're not from the future!
you're crazy!
I am not crazy.
Oh, yeah, Captain Time Travel? Prove it.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm just gonna go lock myself in my room and hide under the covers for a couple years.
if I prove to you I'm from the future, will you go back to the science fair?
Yeah, sure, whatever you say.
Hey, let go of me!
what are you doing? Let go of me! - Okay.
what is this? Where are we going?
to the future!
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
the future has arrived
the future has arrived today
is this proof enough for you?
is it ever!
I never thought that time travel could be possible in my lifetime, and here it is, right in front of me!
the truth will set you free, brother.
this is beyond anything I could've imagined.
this means I could really change my life.
that's right. You can.
next stop, science fair, to fix your Memory Scanner.
Hey, I'm not gonna fix that stupid Memory Scanner.
what? - Wilbur, this is a time machine!
why should I fix my dumb invention when you can take me to see my mom now in this ship?
I could actually go back to that night and stop her from giving me up.
the answer is not a time machine. It's this.
this? You want to know what I think about this?
what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Wilbur, but you don't know what I've lived through.
Lewis, no! - Let go!
you let go! - You're not the boss of me!
Yes, I am, 'cause you're 12, and I'm 13.
that makes me older.
well, I was born in the past, which makes me older and the boss of you!
I am so dead.
I'm not allowed to look at this thing, let alone drive it!
mom and Dad are gonna kill me, and I can tell you this. It will not be done with mercy.
isn't there like a time machine repair shop - or something? - No!
there's only two time machines in existence, and the Bowler Hat Guy has the other one!
well, somebody's gonna have to fix this.
good idea. You're smart. You fix it.
are you crazy? I can't fix this thing.
Yes, you can. You broke it. You fix it.
all right, under one condition.
I fix it, you take me back to see my mom.
what? You didn't even follow through on our last deal.
how can I trust you?
well, you told me you were a time cop from the future.
how can I trust you?
touch?
so do we have a deal?
good day, madam.
I'm here to change the future. - Yes, sir?
I must speak with the man in charge immediately.
Yes, sir. - I have an appointment with destiny.
very good, sir. I'll let Smith know, and I'll have your dry cleaning delivered directly to your suite.
what? - Now, what time is your appointment?
are you talking to me? - Yes.
what time is your appointment?
big hand is on the... Oh, 2: 00!
you're the 2: 00?
Yes. Yes, I am.
you're Mary Johnson?
Yes.
Mary is short for...
Marian?
can that be a boy name? - Yes.
then yes. - Have a seat.
Oh, goody!
pass off invention as my own." Check. Oh, I love checklists.
the board is ready to see you now.
wait. What am I going to say?
I'm never gonna remember that.
would you... Why don't you go? You do it so much better than me.
that's true.
a hat without a head couldn't really pass off an invention as its own.
fantastic! Great idea! I'm so glad I have you!
prepare to be amazed." Oh, I got it!
prepare to be amazed!
this is my invention.
I doubt any of you have seen anything as brilliant as this device.
very well,
miss Johnson?
it's Ms.
you have two minutes. Please begin.
it's shiny! - What is that thing?
well, I like to call it my...
to call it my...
what are you looking at? - No! I... The sun, in my eyes.
well, then let me close the blinds.
now, the name?
well, what...
we can quibble about names at a later date.
the point is, what I have here is special, unique.
Yes. Yes, you must love it and buy it and mass produce it, and the best part is, it's got really comfy headphones.
I wonder, could you lean forward just a little bit, please?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, they are quite comfortable.
what do you hope to accomplish with this?
Oh, nothing of consequence.
I simply wish to crush the dreams of a poor little orphan boy!
after that, it's all a little fuzzy.
you mean, you haven't thought this through?
thirty seconds.
allow me to show you how it works.
first, we turn it on.
that's not it.
ten seconds.
so where do I sign?
Doris, it's all over.
all our hopes and dreams dashed, like so many pieces of a broken machiney thing.
you're right.
success is still ours for the taking.
we must find that boy.
we'll sneak this thing into the garage. You'll have all the tools you need.
what about your parents?
mom never goes in there, and Dad's on a business trip until tomorrow morning.
you've got till then to fix it.
well, fine, but I'm gonna need some blueprints or something for this.
no worries. I got someone who could help us with that.
who dares to disturb my sanctuary?
Carl, it's me. Let me in.
none may enter unless they speak the royal password.
Carl, what are you talking about? We don't have a password.
Yes, we do. I made one up while you were gone.
well, then how am I supposed to know what it is?
you...
good point.
welcome back, little buddy.
so what's up with the stolen time machine?
did you find it? Apparently not, and you managed to bust this one as well.
it'll be fixed before Dad gets home.
and how do you suppose that's gonna...
who's that? - Wow, a real robot!
Hi, I'm Lewis.
well, that was unexpected.
as was that.
if my family finds out I brought you from the past, they'll bury me alive and dance on my grave.
I'm not exaggerating. Well, yes, I am, but not the point.
the point is, your hair's a dead giveaway.
why would my hair be a dead giveaway?
that is an excellent question.
wait! Where are you going?
another excellent question.
but I don't just want to sit here.
stay.
but...
Wow!
Hey, ring my doorbell.
no, no, no, no, ring my doorbell.
ring it. Ring it. Ring it. Look at this door bell. Ring it.
Yes! - That was accidental.
that's an accidental ring. It doesn't count.
it's in the rule book. Look it up.
flat head. - Short roots.
evergreen.
what do you mean, don't go to the family?
how can we not go to the family in this time of family crisis?
by leaving the garage door unlocked, you let the time machine get stolen, and now the entire time stream could be altered!
that and someone took my bike.
look, I told you. It's gonna all work out.
first, we keep Lewis in the garage, away from everybody.
I show up and give him the pep talk of the century.
then he fixes the time machine.
why is it an acorn?
I didn't have time to sculpt everything.
okay, now, the time machine is fixed.
his confidence in inventing is restored.
he goes back to the science fair, fixes his Memory Scanner, thus restoring the space-time continuum.
what about taking him back to see his mom?
I just told him that to buy some time.
Oh, yeah, can't see that one blowing up in your face.
trust me. I got it under control.
wilbur Robinson never fails.
but on the slight chance that I do...
on the slight chance," yeah. You know what? I'll run the numbers.
what is it?
well, it's not...
it doesn't pertain to anything in... You know, there's not necessarily...
there's a 99. 999999% chance that you won't exist.
what? - And I didn't want to tell you, but I did.
I won't exist?
and where does that leave me?
alone, rusting in a corner.
what am I worried about? Now, blueprints?
if this thing ever blows over, I really gotta get away from you and get some quiet time.
what's...
well, hey, there, little fella!
now, I know what you're thinking, and my clothes are not on backwards.
my head is!
Oh, I used to tell that one to my science students.
they didn't laugh, either.
Anywho, what's your name, fruit-head?
well, Lewis, but... - Lewis, huh?
well, hey, Lewis, you haven't seen any teeth around here, have you?
teeth? - Yeah, my teeth.
been digging holes all day. Can't find them anywhere.
all right, look, old man, I need to get back to the garage.
wilbur left me down there, and I wasn't supposed to leave, and these monsters...
monsters? ... attacked me on the porch and...
there's no monsters on the porch, you ninny.
listen to me! - Of course, I also didn't think there was a woodchuck living on my arm, and lookie there!
hope he ain't got rabies.
old man, I need to get to the garage!
well, sure, I'll get you there in a jiffy. I know a shortcut.
welcome to the garage.
well, I'm completely lost.
Hiya, Grandpa.
Hey, Aunt Billie.
Lewis and me are looking for the garage.
we have a garage? - Apparently so.
Lewis, will you give me a hand and time my race?
okay, Gaston, my toy train's ready for you.
that's a toy train?
on your mark, get set, go?
3. 7 seconds. - I win!
okay, Lewis, I got the blueprints.
Lewis?
and five and six and seven and eight. - That's Uncle Joe. He works out.
keep those tummies tucked.
this isn't the garage.
I know.
I don't think the garage is in here, either.
Egads! A very grave matter, indeed.
that's Uncle Art. - A real superhero?
quad Four, Alpha Omega Galaxy, needs a large cheese-and-sausage thin-crust?
I'll be there in 30 minutes, or it's free.
he's a... - Pizza delivery guy.
Lewis?
what are we doing up here? - Looking for the garage.
Oh, yeah!
Laszlo, you stop painting my hat, or I'm telling Ma!
lighten up, sis! - Lasz, I mean it!
children, please! Your mother is trying to take a nap.
what is all the yelling out here?
he started it! - She started it!
I don't want to hear any more!
now, sweetie... - Don't you "sweetie" me!
I'm going for a drive!
that's strange. She usually takes the Harley.
Lewis!
I think my wife Lucille's baking cookies.
bake them cookies, Lucille!
why is your dog wearing glasses?
Oh, 'cause his insurance won't pay for contacts.
that's Uncle Spike, and there's Uncle Dimitri.
Oh, look, there's... - That's the monster!
Oh, no, Lewis, that's our butler, Lefty.
nice to meet you.
Hey, Lefty, any idea how to get to the garage?
well, that's true. We didn't ask her yet.
who? - Wilbur's mom, Franny.
I think you'll like her.
Hey, guys!
you ask me over and over and over
have you seen my peacock-feathered hat?
frogs?
taught them everything they know.
Franny, this is Lewis. - Nice to meet you, ma'am.
perfect timing. We need someone on maracas.
where is your heart at? Nobody knows that
even though you've him, her, me
and an army searching
I've got a feeling you will be reeling
when you are bad and the circus comes to town
grandpa, I think I found your teeth.
and you see me leaving dressed up as a magician
or something like that
Sarsaparilla! My teeth are back!
Ring-a-ding-ding.
all right!
right. Well, glad I could help with the teeth, but, wow, look at the time.
Lewis, I told you to stay in the garage!
I did, but I went up the tube, and I ran into your family, and I...
you met my family?
pop quiz.
who have you met, and what have you learnt?
okay. Bud, Fritz and Joe are brothers.
Fritz is married to Petunia, and is she...
cranky? Yes.
Tallulah and Laszlo are their children.
Joe is married to Billie. Lefty is the butler.
spike and Dimitri are twins, and I don't know who they're related to.
neither do we. Go on.
Lucille is married to Bud, and your dad, Cornelius, is their son.
what does Cornelius look like?
Tom Selleck.
okay, Cornelius is married to Franny, and her brothers are Gaston and Art.
you're forgetting something.
forgetting? Oh, right.
wilbur is the son of Franny and Cornelius.
and nobody realised you were from the past?
Nope.
thank you. Thank you.
hold your applause. Thank you very much.
Doris, get it off! Get it off!
I've got you now.
Lewis!
no, Lewis is my stupid roommate.
my name's Mike Yagoobian. People call me Goob, but today, everyone that beat me up called me "puke face
and "butterfingers" and "booger breath.
