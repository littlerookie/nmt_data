the first move is yours.
Christ.
uh, it's hot in here, right?
you got rope burn from those cuffs? - No, I'm fine.
was held for ransom in Waziristan.
five weeks in a cave.
was cuffed up the whole time.
served us a spoonful of rice and tea twice a day.
they put a little goat milk in it at least?
it was opium, actually.
Oh, so more of a sleepy-time tea.
Yeah.
this whole thing was stupid, working for Patek.
knew we'd get caught.
you're doing the right thing, Eddie.
and who knows? Maybe a step toward a country you once loved enough to die for is Whoa!
our witness just went off the roof!
suicide? - Jumped onto the goddamn parking deck!
Hey, what'd I miss? - Parking deck. now.
all clear. - What the Oh, my god.
so this guy just goes up and over?
Yeah. - That's so weird.
Yeah, everything about this is.
it's like the guy has no history.
his file's all thick black lines.
what was he doing on the balcony in the first place?
Delia, your car's gone. - What?
I just made my last payment. I just had it washed.
my softball gear's in there.
what?
turn my back for one second.
how were you supposed to know the guy's got super spidey powers?
he manipulated me.
he never should have been on the terrace in the first place. Damn it.
Yes, Dan?
GPS puts Delia's vehicle five miles ahead of you.
looks like he exited I-25 and headed east.
hold up. He stopped.
three miles in on Roderick road.
unbelievable.
can't believe he went Costner on us.
to be clear, I'm talking dances with wolves Costner, not Tin Cup Costner or, you know, one of the ten baseball movies.
no? No good?
come on, Marshall, it's gonna be fine.
guy picks a reservation The one place in the U. S.
we don't have open jurisdiction and heads straight for it.
I'm so screwed. - No, you're not.
we are. We're screwed. Thanks to you.
come on, I'm joking.
we're not screwed, we're pursuing your witness.
look, call Stan for a check-with-me if you want, but I say we go now.
Yeah, no, not yet.
only sign of him is Delia's unit, torched on the side of the road.
we're fine. We're following what we assume is his trail.
no, on foot.
I don't know, Stan. I don't see any tribal rep around to ask permission.
Hey, you're probably gonna want to hang up now.
Stan, got to go.
u. S. Marshals.
you're U. S. Marshals trespassing on sovereign Owindo nation land.
no, we're U. S.Marshals pursing the guy who just torched that car.
which you can explain to the chief. - Really?
come on. Or am I grabbing my cuffs?
okay. Now we're screwed.
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not - To neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute distinguishing them from the rest of the population.
and that is... Somebody wants them dead.
what the hell are we doing in here?
Fredericks is out there, right this second, disappearing into the pueblo.
Pueblo.
even in a crisis you're like. What's the word?
specific? Accurate? Correct? It's 40 square miles.
the pueblo is? - The reservation's terrain is rough, uneven.
national park on two sides. He's this close to vanishing, Stan.
we can't force the issue a little?
there's no powering through this. It's delicate.
you know we need a warrant.
I'm not just talking about the witness' witsec status, I'm talking about ours.
what about air support? They can't at least get a jump start while we sit around sucking our
Hey, easy. - Not an option.
wildfires in Colorado. Air ops are out-of-pocket.
then what? What now?
now we make nice with the chief chief-of-police, while, you know - Where are you going? - Okay. I've got to check on norah.
have fun making nice with the sovereign Owindo nation.
you don't need me for that, right?"making nice"?
Stan Mcqueen?
joseph Duncan, bureau of Indian affairs.
this is chief Pierce of the Owindo pueblo P. D.
he's got some questions for you.
and he's gonna ask them himself, if you don't mind. Thanks, Joe.
so...
who you boys chasing?
well, here's what we got.
Eddie Fredericks.
FBI's been after him going on two years.
they got him.
he got loose.
we got to go after him.
well, U.S. Marshals don't get on my land without my say-so.
and that story you just told, it's a very vague story. Insultingly vague.
not our intention. But we need to get going asap - As soon as possible.
even if BIA-that's bureau of Indian affairs
FYI.
even if they sign off on the manhunt, I'm not just turning you guys loose.
you want access to my pueblo, you have to take my people.
they know this land.
any problem with that?
no, not a problem. Thank you.
well...
looks like your warrant is in order.
if you need to look it over, look it over, but, chief, you got a fugitive on your land, and we got a ticking clock.
Heather will ride out with you.
she's the best we got.
Aw, man, should have known. I should have known.
is there gonna be a problem? - Not at all. City folk are my favorite.
I don't live in the city.
live in the suburbs, so
okay, let's move on.
his tracks went east from Roderick road.
that's a day and a half on foot till he hits the pueblo boundary and slips into a national park.
lucky for us, we got something he doesn't.
jetpacks? Pie? Please say,"pie.
you can't trust 'em.
the ratio's off. Too much animal for that little brain.
you know, it's like a lemon.
you'll be fine. - Yeah, I'll be fine. Will he be fine?
one false move, I turn you into a duffel bag, got it?
here I was thinking the U. S. Marshals were the best we got.
what's that supposed to mean?
you hear this guy slipped out a window?
off the roof, actually.
what kind of tool loses a guy off a roof?
talk about screwed.
any good hunting around here? - Yeah.
what do you go after? Deer? Antelope?
both.
my dad used to take me.
these days it's less deer, more meth runners, illegals.
it's a shame.
my people consider the spirit of this land. Every tree, animal. Sacred.
Oh, boy. - It's beautiful.
if you ever want a tour of these hills and valleys,
I know 'em like the back of my hand.
gee, that's nice. She said if you ever want to tour her hills and valleys
tracks stop here.
either the wind or your guy knows what he's doing.
well, it's his guy, technically.
Hey, I know. What's your spirit animal telling you?
I said,"my people," believe that.
as for me, I'm still in the market for a spirit animal.
I had a hamster once, but then she ate her kids. Didn't work out.
Jesus.
what the hell kind of Indian are you?
the underpaid kind.
he was here, in nylon blend.
he swiped Delia's softball jacket.
impressive. - Oh, yeah. He's got all that csi down.
me, I had a more of an indoor childhood, Jersey style.
lot of monopoly.
undefeated, so
Hello?
wait, wait, slow down.
she's pretty. Pretty young.
hadn't noticed. - Really, you hadn't noticed?
you hadn't noticed her shameless flirting?
I'm kind of focused on the manhunt.
here's what I don't get. When did you become George Clooney to Theveronica Marsset?
you got a little venom on your chin. - Yep, on it.
shots fired back at the burned-out vehicle.
chief Pierce was on his way down to investigate.
maybe somebody came back for Fredericks, but who?
I don't care about the who, I just care about the what.
and the what sounds bad.
come on. Definitely gave me the slow horse.
call 911!
it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
I promise, daddy, I promise.
stubborn son of a bitch. - Yeah.
couldn't even wait for backup to ride out.
some people are like that.
you okay? - I'm fine.
we need to move.
you're not going to the hospital? - I said I'm fine.
point is, Pierce's car is the only one here.
preternatural detail being there's only one set of tire tracks.
well, guy shows up, shoots the police chief, car disappears.
no tire tracks, footprints. Neat trick.
Fredericks did say his partner is highly trained. - Could be that.
what?
FBI shook the trees on Abu Patek.
last known location's Vegas, 30 hours ago.
great. So if Fredericks' partner didn't find him, there's a chance that his jihadist former-employer did.
a fact I'm tap-dancing around for Indian affairs.
faster you bring Fredericks in, the less I got to say.
Fredericks seems to be headed for the national park. Stan, I got to- - Go, go, go.
Hey, there, big guy. Raing where you are?
coming down in buckets.
we can talk freely on this line? Okay, good.
no, no, I'm fine, but a colleague's in hot water, and homeland security seemed like a good place for me to try and cool things off.
okay, we've got a fugitive situation.
and I'm staring at this file, but it's heavily redacted.
we both know what that means.
look, my friends are out there chasing him down.
but there's too much we don't know about this guy.
and it would help if we had some idea of what they're up against.
fine, I don't care.
Yes, I'll host thanksgiving.
go ahead.
you know, my dad was a marshal.
you don't have to do this.
his dad was a marshal.
when my granddad retired, he revealed he'd been shot in the line of duty.
he never told anyone in the family before.
he didn't want us to worry.
what's tougher than a father with a badge?
I know, he'll be fine.
Thanks, Marshall.
by the way, for a city guy, you look pretty good in the saddle.
Really?
dear diary. - Knock it off.
what's up, Heather?
don't call her "Heather."It's her name.
this is the point of no return.
that sounds ominous. They have a bathroom here?
snacks?
it's where we lose cell reception.
so if you got someone to call, do it now.
I know this call. I've made this call.
you're not coming home, are you?
daddy said not to date lawmen.
there was an escape.
all hands on deck kind of thing.
so I'm playing hostess on my own tonight.
now last time I had people over
you ordered pizza, put it in the oven, the boxes caught fire, and they had to evacuate the building.
hence, tonight's seviche concept.
I need you here, Marshall, to tell Rob we liked that book he gave us.
looks like you're lying for two tonight. I'm sorry.
don't wait up. - Yeah. Good luck with "all hands on deck." Don't forget to duck.
Thanks. Good night.
must be serious.
most guys would be all over me.
you think pretty highly of yourself. - Not at all.
just lowly of men.
fair enough. Did you call your dad?
he's not a fan of the phone, but I got a text.
good.
what's that music?
God help you if you took my baby to a strip joint.
it's a steak house and we are celebrating.
I sold 60, 000 feet to Mcilvane.
I walk in with Norah in one of those little carrier thingies, big Dan melts.
all of a sudden, he's in grandpa mode. No joke.
the kid is a closer.
where are you anyway?
good question.
believe it or not, on a horse.
say that again? - Never mind. Listen.
this could go late, and I know it's last minute, but I might need you to take the baby tonight.
and when I say,"take her," I mean to my house, not, you know, out clubbing.
no problem. We're golden.
and I should probably go. I think Norah needs her bottle.
Oh, my gosh, how cute is your baby? - Care to join us?
Yep. Got it. Thanks, Chuck.
Sorry-Charles. Thank you, Charles.
Stan, hey. Got an update, and it's bad for us.
we need to protect Marshall here.
we need to control this. And quietly.
Stan, I am on it. I'm working this.
got some intel through my source at DHS.
your "source"? Can we just say your brother? Can we say that?
Fredericks only gave up half his story. He wasn't just a seal.
he was task force blue.
which is why his file's thinner than a takeout menu.
also explains his stunt on the roof. Guy's training is off the charts.
he's Jason Bourne minus the memory loss.
and Mary and Marshall are out of communications range.
not much we can do about that. But you want to protect Marshall politically?
we need a heavy hitter and the bucket of whitewash only D. C. can provide.
I think associate director Campbell is heavy-hitter enough.
you need her number?- Got it on speed-dial.
all right.
these are fresh.
no degradation, sharp edges. She's close.
wait? Who's she? Who's close?
okay, I'm happy playing dumb up to a point, but I don't play stupid.
what the hell's going on here?
when the FBI apprehended Fredericks, two days ago, his partner evaded capture. Based on the size of the print and everything else we know, these are probably her tracks.
you know what I think?
the sketchy background info, no sign of your marshals special operations group
I don't think you're out here to arrest this guy.
I think you're out here to protect him.
we're just here to bring him in.
be dark soon. - Yeah.
we should probably set up camp.
and you and I will take a quick ride ahead, see where the tracks lead.
you can hang back here.
did you just give me permission to "hang back here"?
no, I just- - What?
whoever this she is, she found your guy, she already shot one cop.
we don't know what we're riding into.
you too? Oh, my god.
all right, say it. Say it! - What?
well, I'll say it.
and you've got a kid. - Heather, maybe let me handle this.
you know what, do me a favor. Don't "handle this. Okay?
I had a baby. I wasn't stricken with some degenerative maternal syndrome.
I don't know what world you live in, but I live in a world where almost every cop has a family.
we're all going. Got it?
good. Christ.
where are you going?
gonna saddle up "dog food."That's right, I call him "dog food" now.
Yeah, I'm gonna follow some non-degraded tracks.
you know, mom stuff.
I would have stepped in there, but she didn't leave much room.
probably best.
think our guy's down there?
that's where I'd be.
okay.
Hey, we're gonna find him. - Yeah, yeah.
we just have to do it before his partner does.
two sets of tracks now.
no sign of struggle.
she must have just missed him. - Let's hope so.
let's spend the night. We'll start out in the morning.
Ugh! Gross.
what's with all the nature out here?
we're in nature.
cougars.
Oh, no. You're doing the knowing look thing?
come on, why are you doing the knowing look thing?
we have to bring in the horses. - In here? In the barn?
come on, it's kind of nice in here. Let's not ruin the barn with animals.
guys? Guys?
come on. Really?
what if they, like-I don't know Stampede or something?
I think we'll be better off with live horses in the morning.
I need to speak to Campbell now. If she's in a meeting, pull her out.
if she's with the director-Oh, great.
Yeah, thanks, yeah.
Susan, Stan Mcqueen.
Yeah, listen, I got a bit of a situation here, and I was wondering
well, I don't know if I'd call it "cashing in my chips."But we were processing a high-security witness yesterday.
guy bolted before we could transfer him to the correctional center in El Reno.
I could use your help at the state department before this blows back on me or lands on the inspector who lost him.
I'll get you his file-The little I've been able to dig up.
and, Susan... Thank you.
come on, come on.
stupid cell signal.
it's tough being away from the baby?
Yeah, let's not do a tampon ad, okay? It's fine being away.
it's one night. She's with her father.
just like to get 'em on the phone.
got it.
I, um
I was there when he jumped off the roof.
all this... It's my fault.
that was you?
you're the tool?
I'm the tool.
barely took my eye off him.
12 hours later, I still don't have the guy back.
lives are in danger, not to mention careers, and I'm lying on the floor of a barn with a woman whose dad I got shot.
if we're doing confession, I've got at least one.
yeah?
until six months ago, I was working patrol in San Diego.
I lived a block from the beach.
I moved back when my mom died to keep an eye on the old man.
doing a great job, huh?
I'm sorry.
what, uh - What's the other one?
the "other one" what?
uh, confession. You said you had at least one.
I volunteered to take you out today.
thought you were cute.
Mary? - Heard it.
what the
Hey, Marshall, wake up.
your girlfriend's awol.
Hey, sun's up. Let's go.
what the hell?
next time leave a note!
come on. Let's go.
think my horse is broken. - Yeah, well, mine's not. Try and keep up.
I got to say, it's not so easy on the lady parts.
you know, you can go.
you don't have to wait for me. I'm fine.
I'm pacing myself. - Really?
don't patronize me. - You first.
what's that supposed to mean? - You being nice earlier.
when? When was I nice?
don't worry. We'll find him." That's when I know I'm up a creek, when you go from semi-hostile teasing to openly supportive.
fine. We probably won't find him.
you lost a witness. Happy?
no, I'm not.
where the hell's she going?
what is that?
and old movie set. They shot some westerns here in the '60s. - Cool.
I'm sorry I put you in this spot. - Don't be.
easy, easy, bo, all right? You already shot a cop.
we're not taking out another one and two u. s.Marshals.
it hurts us if we kill them.
we're airborne in ten minutes.
go, go, go.
you and me, right?
Yeah, you and me. - All right. Rope.
I'm fine! go!
Fredericks? - You think?
she's down.
you all right?
Christ, they came out of nowhere.
who? Who's they? - Your fugitive, plus some chick with short hair.
that's his partner. So she's not here to kill him.
brunch plans? - They're in this together for sure.
and they're airborne in ten minutes. - Airborne?
they said,"airborne." - Seriously? Plane?
just finished with the horse. Terrific.
Bonnie and Clyde are armed to the teeth and awaiting air support.
listen, puss out if you want, but these people shot my dad.
I'm going after them, with or without you. - Really? With what?
we've got two six-shooters, zero horses between the three of us, and nothing even approaching an ace in the hole.
can't believe I said that out loud. Who am I?
no way.
no. No way.
all right, now she's just showing off.
if your prom date's wrong about the time frame, then we're stuck here in thisscooby-doomovie set, and they're already up in the air.
you politely overlook my career-ending rooftop gaffe.
overlooking or savoring?
what?
holy crap.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.
what the hell, Bo?
sorry, baby.
next time, don't get caught.
you know how this plays out.
you know what happens next.
she knows, Eddie.
she also knows that if I don't punish you, others will feel free to make the same mistakes.
I didn't tell them anything.
appearances, though, are so important, hmm?
this just keeps getting better.
good news is they won't kill him here. They'll do it in front of their pals.
buys us time.
pretty dim shade of silver lining.
don't move! Don't move!
don't move! Stay down! - Get out, get out.
that's fun to say.
you know what else is fun to say?
you're under arrest.
you have the right to remain silent, and anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I'm still getting the run around.
I want to know who the hell you were chasing out there.
cause whoever it was shot a chief of police
a tribal elder - On tribal land.
which we entered on your nod.
based on a story that has as much staying power as smoke signals.
skip Richardson, office of the coordinator of counterterrorism.
here's what I need. I need the BIA to play ball on this. You BIA? Super.
gonna get the marshals off your land, pronto.
Eddie Fredericks is going to regular old prison.
the co-conspirators will be extradited to Indonesia to stand trial there.
meanwhile, my office is drafting a release.
I assume we'll have your complete cooperation.
I'll get my end in motion.
see how that works?
Susan sends her best. - Well, that's great.
you know, uh, it's funny.
one could argue that the end result of this Fredericks snafu has got the marshal service looking pretty good, huh?
Yeah, one could argue Fredericks getting loose in - the first place tells a different story. - Well, sure.
but seeing as how we just wrapped up Abu Patek, not to mention Fredericks' partner
mcqueen, get to it. I got a plane waiting.
listen, when this gets written up, official, - it'd be great if we could lose that stuff about my guy and the roof. - Oh, yeah?
guy went off the roof? - Did I say,"roof"?
well, well, it looks like our little problem is no more.
cold comfort.-Stan, if I had known
Marshall- - I'd feel better- - Not necessary.
it's over. All right? We're good.
right off the freaking roof?
okay, hold on, hold on.
daddy's coming. Look, daddy's coming. Look, yeah.
here, daddy's here. Daddy's here. Look.
Yes, here I am. Daddy's right here.
that's it?
okay, well, then daddy's gonna take a shower, because somebody threw up on daddy's neck.
remember that? Went right down daddy's shirt.
okay, I'll be right back.
your girlfriend a detective too?
how'd you know?
number on your phone - Albuquerque p. d.
lucky girl.
listen, I'm, uh
I'm sorry I got your dad shot.
I'm sorry you think you need to apologize.
you're gonna do great, being here, being back.
maybe it's the right thing. - Maybe.
local girl makes good.
you know, if things don't work out with your detective, I bet you can track me down.
I mean, you found your fugitive.
I, um - I wanted to give you something.
you made this? - What? God, no. Casino gift shop.
right, of course.
my mom always loved the white wolf.
she used to say it's loyal and fiercely independent.
anyway.
sweet. It's a bottle opener. Right on.
as you can tell from the even and sympathetic tone of my voice,
I have modulated out all frequencies connoting condescension, - and yet, I need to know- - Sweet jesus, there's got to be a quicker way to say this.
do you have a plan? I mean, in the event of- In case
in case the next domestic jihadist we chase down is a better shot?
no.
I'm gonna make a plan, but as of yet, there's no plan.
cause if I'm gonna be standing next to you, dodging bullets- - Hey, hey. Stop.
this is where I'm supposed to be. When I'm here, I'm here.
if I thought I were unfocused or distracted or putting you at risk in any way, I'd hang 'em up.
copy that.
so it seemed like she really had a thing for tall, dork, and handsome, huh?
Heather? - Yeah, Heather.
for the record, any flirting you may or may not have witnessed was strictly a one-way street.
I'm nothing if not faithful. Abigail
I love going home to her.
Yeah, why wouldn't you?
she cleans up after you, walks the dog.
she's a southern belle with a gun and a badge.
also, she hair-flip laughs at your moronic little factoids.
hell, I'd be faithful to that.
semi-hostile teasing. Welcome back.
she's returned! Ooh, and she looks tired. - Sorry.
really sorry. I got back as fast as I could.
Thanks.
Hey, bug. -There we go.
Hey, what is up? Look at you, you're huge!
stop growing. Stop it.
what have you guys been up to, huh?
you're looking at it.
that's actually not true. I spent a decent amount of time notshowering.
got about ten minutes of sleep.
sort of get sleep deprivation as a torture tactic.
Aw, that'd make a nice scrapbook header.
Yeah, you know, I'm not complaing, - and I love spending time with her. - I know, Mark.
she's a little young for boarding school.
they like to see a teeny bit more neck strength.
Hey, is this wine up for grabs?
we need help.
I'm not talking full-time, and I'll split the cost. Whatever.
but we're not quitting our jobs and we can't keep doing this.
so who? Who are we trusting more than us to take care of her?
some unm philosophy major, in it for the pizza money, and texting all day?
some baby-shaker off of craigslist?
no one. There's no one we can trust as much.
but, since the beginning of time, people have trusted other people to care for their children.
look, you have a gun.
I'm from New Jersey.
we will grill these people.
but we gotta have people to grill.
you know what I mean?
baby steps.
I do have a gun.
that's the spirit.
you did good today.
for the team.- For the team.-Cheers.
of course the marshal service will replace your car, obviously. - Obviously.
still, something's off.
I mean, I get we had to protect marshall.
but assistant director Campbell's recent visit?
some are operating under the theory that you two have been fraternizing.
but I don't buy it.
budget cuts, today's cover-up- Because that's exactly what this was.
I think our office is on the chopping block.
you know, I hated it when my boss used to say this to me, but that's really above your pay grade.
I'm not really comfortable with that answer.
and I wouldn't want an inspector in this office who would be.
now look, in the future, whether we're all together or scattered far and wide, promise me none of you will ever take a witness out on the balcony again, ever.
now tell me the whole story, from the top.
cause the news, everything I've seen online, it's all suspiciously spotty.
okay, so this is not gonna impress you in any way.
um, you know the terrace at work?
the mind's ability to fool itself knows almost no boundaries.
but eventually, the lucky among us come to our senses, the smoke fades, and we see things for how they really are.
no law enforcement for you.
I'm thinking accountant or stockbroker.
everyone hates a stockbroker.
a safe little accountant who works by hand and candlelight.
whether by words of wisdom or the flicker of a flashlight, we muddle through the fog, landing on the long and winding road we're meant to travel.
however baffling, we learn to trust the path, or at least stay on it.
come on, Bonnie!
that a girl, Bonnie!
you got it. Go, Bonnie!
come on! Come on, go! Come on! Yes!
she keeps that up, we got a full ride to o. u.In the bag.
way to go, Bonn.
hello.
what?
what kind of emergency?
I'm on my way.
whitman needs meds delivered to his office asap.
Oh, can't it wait?
it's the championship. Come on.
I'll see your championship, and I'll raise you the 5 gs I'm due if I get there in an hour.
5 grand?
and it doesn't even put me on the road for a week.
meet up after, celebratory pizza?
Oh, yeah, I'll save you a piece.
gonna need more than one piece.
thanks for getting here so fast.
no sweat. 118ccs midazolam, 400ccs propofol.
what happened?
gastric bypass. Some complications, but the patient's stabilized.
here's your fee and bonus. And again, thanks for being so prompt.
if you or anesthesia need anything else
no, thanks. I'm good.
I'm on it.
Oh, my - It's okay.
my god. - All right.
please. - Deep breath, please.
he's dying. What Jesus, what the hell did you do to him?
he's we've got it under. We've got it. Hey, no, no!
we got this under. Don't call anyone.
according to my memory of sixth grade social studies, 200 something years ago, our founding fathers fought for certain inalienable rights.
free speech, the pursuit of happiness, the simple chance to have a choice.
but there's such a thing as too many choices.
I long for the days of three TV channels.
not her. Delete her.
delete? She's got ten years' experience.
at what? Pretending away that unibrow? No, thanks.
Yeah, cause that disqualifies her as a nanny.
first of all, don't say "nanny."
you can take all your pervy little babysitter fantasies and stick 'em in a drawer.
I mean, anyone who can't manage their own facial hair isn't getting within a mile of this kid.
experts call this the paradox of choice, where having too many options can lead to the wrong one, or to the worst one Making no choice at all.
here are her green beans.
and don't forget to give her the sweet potatoes at lunch.
Oh, and don't let me forget to call the Andaluz about that stegosaurus.
I don't even understand that sentence.
the Andaluz. I know the chef. - Right.
anyway, she's got a kid, and somehow old sticky fingers here came home from the park with his stegosaurus.
just remind me to call.- No problem. - Good.
we're not done here. - Mark.
I'm serious, I can't take any more time off, and I'm not walking into another meeting in the bjorn.
come on, will you just - I'll narrow the field down to five.
we'll grill 'em over lunch. Deal?
fine.
just send me their names.
background checks.
just to be clear, Dr. Whitman's not some down on his luck quack trying to score a little extra tennis whites money.
he harvested organs, selling them on the international black market.
massive profits don't even begin to tell the story.
his specialty is kidneys.
removes one during what his patients assumed was a simple gastric bypass.
and his victims being under anesthesia are none the wiser.
bingo.
whitman poached organs from 40 unwilling patients in two years.
and you supplied the anesthesia.
Yeah, as a sales rep for keating pharmaceuticals.
the patients weren't the only unwitting ones. I had no idea, I swear.
he wasn't ordering any unusual amounts.
John didn't do anything. I mean, he's not that kind of man.
it's gonna be fine, honey.
I guess.
well, the upside is we're all gonna be together again.
that job that y'all got him, it's gonna keep him close to home, right?
travel will be minimal and local.
he's all yours.
I'm so tired of being on the road, half the year away from stace and the kids. I mean, this witsec thing really could turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
I have a question.
I can't play lacrosse anymore? Like, at all?
I'm afraid not, Bonnie.
you were all state, which is impressive, but it makes you very easy to find.
okay, well, that blows.
honey, I know, but as long as we're together as a family and safe, we're gonna get through this.
Hey, look at me. We will.
I don't wanna take half your sandwich.
and the feeling's mutual, but you always do.
don't worry, I've learned to over order. You're welcome, by the way.
Oh, I can't. We're interrogating sitters for Norah today.
I wanna do this on an empty stomach. I'm, like, 12% more judgmental that way.
just 12? - Hey, hey, not so fast. Pastrami keeps.
Hey, what's the deal? Who knocked over j. Crew?
the Wilsons, lovely people.
cooperative, polite, ready to start again. - They're creepy.
Stepford creepy. They're like the fake family in the frame.
here we go. - What?
people can love each other without drama, Mary.
dysfunction does not a family make.
okay, look, all I'm saying is you can't judge a book.
Ted Bundy played tennis. You take my point.
they're the Wilsons. - Oh, crap.
did I just sleep eat?
Hey, did you hook me up with that reservation at Andaluz?
Oh, man, Marshall - I know you think my anniversary is
hold on, anniversary?
you're dating. It's not your anniversary.
it's just I told Abigail to brace herself for a big surprise, which only pays off if I can, you know, surprise her with something.
cross my heart and hope to die.
I really mean that last part.
what? Mine didn't come with a pickle.
that's so interesting.
how do you do?
put my stuff down.
Hey, so could I talk to you for a quick sec, mark?
Yes. - Awesome.
won't take long. One second here.
is this a joke?- She's got phenomenal references.- Oh, yeah, i'm sure she does.
look, mark, we're not hiring some slutty hall monitor to watch my kid.
and Erin Koester, if that's her real name, has a record.
jaywalking. - It's a crime, mark.
she did it twice. She's a repeat offender.
keep looking. - I'll do my best.
no, no, no. No, don't do your best. You gotta do better than that. Do my best.
come on, it's been a week. Give me just one clue.
you're a detective. I'm not giving you a clue.
Marshall, don't make me bring in my forensics unit.
hold on.
saved by the cell. I gotta call you back.
Hey, Stacy. - I don't know what to do, Marshall.
I got a call.- Slow down.- John is in danger.
what do you mean, he's in danger?
I need you to get over here right now, please.
so Stacy says he's been getting hang ups on his cell?
dozens. She's worried Whitman's people might've tracked them down.
we need to check john's phone, every call, incoming and otherwise.
would've been nice if he'd picked up.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, check it out.
Where's he going?
that's not the car we got him.
run the plate.
still wondering who those hang ups were from?
talk about a fast operator.
the guy's been here a week.
Marshall, Delia, this isn't what it looks like. - No?
it isn't that you've been in town for six days, and you already have a mistress?
this isn't cool, john.
this isn't goddamn France.
it's not She's not my mistress.
look, I know what you're thinking. - Daddy!
you came home early!
since 1970, the federal witness protection program has relocated thousands of witnesses, some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
seven years. - Seven years.
you led a double life for seven years?
don't. - I won't.
won't say a thing.
it's awfully big of me, wouldn't you say?
get it, big a me? cause, you know. - Got it.
as this case has gotten unexpectedly larger in scope, I'm assigning an additional inspector.
this is inspector Shannon.
how do you do? So two wives, two houses, two sets of kids, it's impressive.
well done, I can barely get down to the gym.
I kept one family in Tulsa and the other one in Norman, a few hours away.
made sure my lives never crossed.
two names, two cell phones, two everything.
my job allowed me to spend a week with each family on and off.
holidays, I just made sure I alternated, kept things, you know...
fair for everyone.
Oh, well, that's nice you're fair.
and technically he hasn't broken any bigamy laws since he's only legally married to Stacy.
okay, I'm just trying to keep up. Stacy's the brunette? - The blonde.
but the brunette - Eve.
Eve thinks - Eve thinks john's her husband.
how'd you pull that off?
I staged a wedding and printed a phony marriage license.
holy crap.
When'd you find the time to shoot jr?
Mary. - I used a pseudonym.
John Wilson. Eve thinks that I'm John Wilson.
which is your witsec name.
unreal. So now you're john Wilson to both families.
it seemed easier.
look, I never meant for this to happen.
I was a happily married man, and then I met eve at one of my client's offices.
she was a nurse.
it was love at first sight.
mm, last of the hopeless romantics.
I know how this all sounds.
sociopaths always say that. They don't really mean it.
I've taken care of my families.
paid the bills, put food on the table.
tables.
other than this situation,
I've always been completely honest with my families.
okay, I love 'em. All of them.
John, how on earth did you think you were gonna get away with this?
I don't know.
if I hadn't gotten so many calls from my wife
you mean from your fake wife intercepted by your real wife?
you've ruined these women's lives.
not to mention your children's. How you gonna look your kids in the eye?
inspector.
why don't you step outside, get some air?
okay, please, I know that I violated my m. o.u.
I completely screwed up, and I am so sorry.
but my families are in danger.
are Stacy and the kids just gonna get kicked out of the program?
and what am I gonna do about eve and lu, huh?
I'll get Ausa Perillo on the phone, let him make that call.
in the meantime, you sit tight. All right?
don't marry anyone.
I don't care what you say, Stan gave you the hothead heave ho and not me.
that's it, every year on this date, we're having cake.
you don't find that guy repugnant? - No.
I find him common, typical.
it's a classic male fantasy. It's Betty and Veronica.
he gets one that's blonde and perky. The other's a busty brunette with spunk.
doesn't make me angry. It makes me yawn.
and this cynical attitude of yours has nothing to do with your dad and his proclivity for multiple families?
maybe save the psychobabble.
perillo wants eve and her daughter in a hotel until he can do a threat assessment.
two questions. How much do I tell her?
and can I be cuffed to john when I do?
that's cute. You can tell eve all about witsec, but any word of john's other family is off limits.
we can't predict how she's gonna react.
Yeah, she could go full Bobbit on him.
little chop chop, snip snip.
Yeah, well, just get eve and her kid set up and safe. And no sharp objects.
Eve? We're U. S. Marshals.
I'm inspector Shannon. This is inspector Mann.
Yeah, John said you were coming.
great. You ready?
almost. He said to pack a bag for a couple days.
Hey, Lulu, will you go run out to the sandbox for a little bit?
cute kid. - Thank you.
she's been a real trooper with the move.
she's used to john being away on business.
is that how you two met? On business?
Yeah, business.
and then we fell in love.
he has such a big heart.
we've heard.
look, inspectors, I'm trying my best to stay calm.
but what is this?
Eve, we can't - John says you can't hardly tell me anything, even where he is.
but please.
your husband, he's a witness in a major federal investigation.
he's entered witness protection, and you may need to as well.
witness protection?
Yes.
why didn't he just tell me?
he said we had to move to New Mexico because he got a new job.
John has never lied to me before about anything.
Eve, listen to me.
right now we just wanna make sure you and your daughter are secure.
you don't want to scare Lulu, right?
and you need to stay calm. Can you do that for me?
Yeah. - Good. Good.
Hey, baby.
this guy's a hall of fame weasel, no one's arguing.
but his value's hard to overstate.
even if the marriage to wife number two is illegal, the kid's still his kid.
that means an additional residence, additional stipend.
Oh, Perillo, you're killing me here. D.C. is up my ass about the budget as it is.
your ass has my sincere apologies.
the decision's been made.
so both families stay in witsec.- No.- No.
Yes, but on one condition.
Bobbit, Bobbit. - You have to keep going back to that?
have to" is strong.
both women need to be told the truth.- Good.- Sweet!
can I get a backstage pass?
actually, yes, in a Manner of speaking.
guess who gets to break the news.
careful what you wish for.
I'm not following. What do you mean,"who I think he is"?
let's go simpler.
the name you know him by, John Wilson, is not his real name.
what?
his real name's John Arnett.
he's the oldest son of Ron and Alice Arnett who live just outside of Tulsa.
he has two younger sisters.
no, John's parents died before we met, and he's an only child.
okay, this isn't gonna be easy, but
I'm sorry.
that's last Christmas. Those are John's parents.
and who is that woman?
and those kids, who are those kids?
Oh, my god.
so much less fun than I thought it would be.
funny story, your husband's got another family.
finkel couldn't do the heavy lifting on that one?
she thought it would be best if each wife heard the news from an authority figure.
Pssh, authority figure.
she knows you hem your own pants, right?
how'd original recipe wife take it?
Hey, hey! Stacy, no.
you screw another woman behind my back!
you flashed that phony smile at me on how many Christmases?
and anniversaries? - It's okay.
how could you do that? To our kids?
you asshole!
it's okay,- I'm fine. Get off of me!- All right.
Stacy, listen.
we need to try to keep this out of the realm of the physical, okay?
now, I understand your anger. It is completely justified.
but just try to focus on using your words.
my words.
okay, I'll use my words.
are you insane?
you cheating sack of
you lied to me, to my face, to our children for seven years.
what I thought five seconds ago was seven wonderful years.
Stacy. If I had known...
don't! Don't you ever say my name.
John... Is there anything you'd like to say?
I won't deny that what I've done is wrong, but I did it... I did it because I love you.
both of you.
I love your children.
and I know I lied about a lot of things, and for that I am so sorry, but the way that I feel about you and my commitment to all of you was not a lie.
just keep your mouth shut.
you should've kept your goddamn dick in your pants.
Hey, you think this is just about sex?
I fell in love.
my god, don't you get that that's worse?
I love both my families.
now I know this sounds ludicrous, but you two are the most beautiful, amazing, kind women in the world.
Yeah, that crap's gonna fly.
that's why I busted ass all those years, so you could stay at home and raise our kids.
it wasn't easy, but it was worth it.
I mean, look at Bonnie and Ryder and how happy they are.
and Lu, she's incredible.
I'm sorry.
please, give me a chance.
we could start over, keep our family... - Don't say it.
together, you know?
I swear to god he sells this, he deserves the glengarry leads.
guys. Take it outside.
let's go.- Are you kidding? This is just getting good. - Mary.
guys, out.
Jesus, that was a poop storm. - Yeah, no kidding.
that was like Kramer versus Kramer versus Kramer in there.
never in my life have I been kicked out of a room.
now twice in one week. You're a bad influence.
Oh, man, it's mark. I gotta go.
we're narrowing down candidates.
good luck depriving well meaning people of gainful employment.
yeah,'cause I need luck.
we'll talk more, john.
inspector Mann, you ready to try again?
so we're just supposed to stay together in witness protection?
all of us? Ridiculous.
what, we're all just supposed to live here under one roof like one big happy family?
that is insane.
it's insane, and I'm not doing it.
you have the option of remaing in witsec separate from john in different cities.
however, we are advising you to undergo two weeks of family therapy first.
what? Together?
as in all of my family, my kids, and then with her, with john's little
listen, like it or not, Lu is Bonnie and Ryder's half sister.
Oh, my god.
we need to help the kids process this, get everything out in the open. No more secrets.
we've arranged for both families to be placed in the same hotel while the therapy takes place.
and what if I say no?
I'm not moving anywhere until I talk to my kids.
whatever their reaction, the option to leave the program is of course open to all parties.
good? - No. Not good.
but fine.
fine.
daddy loves you very much.
and just like everybody else, daddy makes mistakes sometimes.
there we go. Just take your time. - Thank you.
it's cool, we've got a lot of time, so don't rush.
Yeah, thanks so much for coming. We'll let you know.
all righty then.
uh, no.
Mary, she raised seven children.
Yeah, when, 1912?
forget it. Norah's gonna be crawling in five minutes.
cross her off the list.
good god, this is endless.
principal Stuber?
what are you doing here? - Mary.
I stopped being principal Stuber two years ago, so "Joanna" will do.
Hey, mom. How was your flight? - It was wonderful.
let me get my hands on the little angel.
hello. There you go. - Mom knew we were looking for somebody, and she figured she'd help until we figured things out.
so you retired?
hard to believe. Just give up the iron fist cold turkey?
Oh, I had enough of that.
with Mark's father gone and you two apparently allergic to anything east of the Mississippi, I had to come to you.
okay, but - Mary, turn me down if you want, but sooner or later you're gonna need me.
and my money's on sooner.
look at this dinosaur, sweetie. From the cretaceous period.
can you say "cretaceous"?
you know what, I think she's hungry.
these people starving you? Let's get something
I hooked us up, right?
you happy? - No, not happy. Unhappy, mark.
that's principal Stuber.
you should have told me.
this was supposed to be a "we" thing, mark.
instead you go and pearl harbor me with the stube?
Mary, we need help.
fine.
fine, for now. But we're not done with this.
I gotta go. Bye, principal Stuber.
call me Joanna.
Bye.
is it a hot air balloon ride?
Yes, it is. - No, I know you.
that's too easy. That's a red herring.
it's not a red herring. It's a lie.
there's a difference. - You are incorrigible.
I gotta take this.
the woman sure knows when to call.
I'll start the pancakes.
Hey, Oscar. - Yes, dear?
I'm walking into the Andaluz as we speak.
the great stegosaurus hand off is minutes away from scoring you a primo table.
what do you want, window, fireplace, kitchen side?
I can definitely score you kitchen side.
uh, window. Fireplace is not so good.
I'm a tad xerodermic.
I don't know what xerodermic means.
all I know is when you say it, it makes me want to punch you in the throat.
holy crap. - What?
Stan is here.
he's eating with some glamazon.
seriously, she's buttering his biscuit.
Oh, I shouldn't. No, no, no.
I gotta watch my girlish figure.
Ah, from what I saw last night, your figure's doing just fine.
Ooh, thank you. - Go, Stan.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I take it back.
stop, Stan. Sweet Jesus, I'm gonna puke in the planter.
what? - They're kissing!
Ugh, no, no, make it stop.
Ugh, lots of tongue, sloppy open mouth sandwich kinda deal.
Ugh, don't tell me that. Why'd you tell me that?
sorry, pal, I didn't want to know it alone.
Mmm, I should go.
if I'm late to class again, I'm gonna have to start giving refunds.
Oh, my god, they're coming this way.
this is too good and bad. I'm confused.
I'll see you when I get off work, okay?
you work such long days, Stanley.
I wish you would tell me why.
you know why. I'm a U. S.Marshal.
some things I just...
Yeah, there were some things my ex wouldn't tell me either, like credit card fraud, gas station hold ups.
okay, sit down.
make up your minds, people.
I'm gonna tell you my big secret.
I used to...
have a fro out to here, a full head of hair.
mutton chops to match.
that's a true story.
and I'm not a crook.
get away. - Ugh, hold on.
Perillo's calling. I'll talk to you later.
the reservation.
what's up, Perillo?
damn it.
I got here as fast as I could.
I thought Abigail was gonna kill me for not eating her pancakes.
I'm gonna take that literally or die trying.
which one of the wives are we dealing with here?
hard to say. Could be either.
last night one of them called Dr. Whitman's office from a pay phone, left a message offering to give up john's location.
hell hath no fury like two women scorned.
we're moving both families to a secondary location.
this time everybody's got around the clock security details.
lock it down. No phone calls without permission.
for someone who just sipped from the chalice of Eros, he's in a foul humor.
could just be sore. Her legs go up to his bald spot.
doctor Whitman's out on bail, pending trial, but FBI's got eyes on him and his guys ever since.
so every call into that office gets recorded.
we have a warrant to monitor all incoming and outgoing.
thankfully we caught this before the doctor had a chance to hear it.
I know you want to hurt him. He deserves to be hurt.
he's horrible. You want to know where to find him?
be at this number at 5: 00 tomorrow. - Definitely female.
Yeah, and some sort of lady Vader thingy.
voice morph app.
which one do you want? Pick a wife, any wife.
no, I wouldn't do that. I swear.
okay.
but it'd be understandable if you did. And it's better we know now.
I mean, I get how pissed off you gotta be at john.
I'm upset, yeah, but - That doesn't mean I'd want him dead.
he's the father of my children.
look, I know that I lost it when I found out about everything yesterday, but I would never wanna...I would never hurt him.
I mean, I don't know, don't they say that it's always the more quiet mousy types you gotta watch out for?
don't they say that?
we ran your criminal record, eve.
you wanna tell me about your ex's motorcycle?
that was an accident.
I was a kid. I was a hothead , was years ago before I met john.
before we had Lu.
I'm not saying you made the call.
I'm just saying if you did, given what the guy put you through, i'd find it really hard to blame you.
I'm telling you,
it wasn't me.
kids? - Yep.
now she's in there with the wives actually earning her paycheck this week.
FYI, my money's on eve. - Based on what?
ten years ago she went demo derby on her ex's harley.
said she's got things under control now, but
I don't know, Stacy's been married to him longer.
more time invested, more to lose.
whatever, the only thing keeping any man monogamous is reactions like this or, you know, worse.
again with that, seriously?
cause no man deserves that. - Wait a minute, what?
the guy who couldn't stand to be in the same room with john is suddenly simpatico?
Oh, I see. You've got it too, the Betty Veronica complex.
the blonde work wife, the underaged brunette girlfriend.
did you just call yourself my work wife?
I think I did.
you and your daughter think that I'm a home wrecker!
Oh, what, and you're not? - I didn't even know about you!
you wrecked my home! - That is ridiculous!
and now you want to bring my kids into it? What is wrong with you?
I'm not bringing Bonnie into anything. She called me.
I told you I talked to you about that.
enough, enough, enough! Knock it off, both of you. - She's crazy.
her and her daughter.
Eve, let's not make things any more acrimonious.
Hey, you know what, don't talk to me about it.
I'm not the one calling people up and lighting into them like some kinda psycho!
whoa, whoa, whoa, what's that mean?
I punished Bonnie for that. I took away her phone.
uh, may I see that, please?
if I speak with the tongues of angels and have not love, - I am become a clanging cymbal. -Always with the quotes.
if I speak with the tongues of angels and have not love, - I am become a clanging cymbal. - Great.
same voice modification.
Bonnie, you in there?
where is she? In her room. What's up?
she's gone. Damn it!
Oh, man. Figure that drop's what, 8 feet?
makeable for a kid of her age and agility. Son of a - Go, go, go.
dude, when did you last check on her? - Ten minutes.
Stan, reach out to APD. We've got a missing kid.
damn it.
I'm saying we gotta two track this. It's not just Bonnie. We gotta find the people she called.
we catch them, we save the kid.
Mary's coordinating with the FBI, and we got an APD out to the locals.
you know for sure she made the call?
the voice modification on her phone matched the one on the tape.
we're just lucky she never reached anyone in a position to do anything about it.
God bless the boys in i. t.
I don't know how lucky we should feel just yet.
Bonnie is still out there, alone, vulnerable.
and still pissed off at her dad. If she makes another call to Whitman
he and his guys will hop a flight before the phone stops ringing.
McQueen. - It's Delia. I got john.
picked him up from work unharmed. We're coming to you.
he knows what's what?
I filled him in.
all right. Get an e.t.a?
not a good one. We're going, like, 3 miles per hour.
pile up at the Lomas exit.
traffic collision. Average speed, 10 miles per hour.
Delia, I need you and john here now.
gonna get off and take central. Figure I'm there in 20.
Oh, great.
did you find her?
please, just Just tell me something good.
our people are on it.
we have every resource devoted to finding your daughter, getting her safe.
please.
I just, I can't believe that she did this.
well, given what he's done to her, to all of you, I'm not surprised.
I can't imagine what you must think of me.
living in oblivion for so many years.
love makes us do things we can't understand.
see things that maybe aren't really there.
we're all capable of that.
just please tell me you'll find her.
Hey, big love.
it is just the two, right?
tell me you don't have a redhead stashed behind door number three.
I'm just worried about my daughter.
you have no idea where she might have gone?
if she might have maybe called someone, like a friend from before?
I don't think so.
after Bonnie found out about everything, she wouldn't even speak to me.
I mean, she was already upset about not being allowed to play for Edison.
top lacrosse team in the state.
I'm kind of a fan.
lacrosse has fans?
I tried to tell her how sorry I was, that all this was for her own safety.
she wouldn't hear it.
we'll find her, john. We will.
if I were 14 and pissed off at my dad, and he told me where not to go
Hey, Marshall, you feel like taking a ride?
over there.
Bonnie. - Get away from me!
Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie. - Leave me alone.
how could you do this?
I mean, you need another family?
we're not enough? Is that it?
no, of course not, honey. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
mom was crying.
you made her cry for hours.
she couldn't stop.
please, Bonnie. Please, I'm begging you.
please forgive me.
forgive you?
Jesus, I don't even believe you.
Bonnie!- Bonnie! Oh, baby.- I'm so sorry.
Oh, baby, it's okay. Thank god. Thank god you're okay. - Sorry.
I missed you guys. I missed you so much.
so they get to stay in the program? You know, all of them?
Yeah, talked to Perillo. DOJ is gonna let this die.
they see it for what it is.
poor kid.
confusing time. - Yeah, no kidding.
you wake up in the middle of Bizarrobrady bunch, - not exactly easy to stick the landing. - No, it's not.
but she'll get some help. And she doesn't have to see her father until she's ready.
we've arranged to locate john in the same city as both families.
he'll have visitation, but it'll be structured and limited.
going from two families to none, that's rough.
dumb hump's lucky he's in the same city.
guy who treats his family like that doesn't deserve a second chance.
something touch a nerve? - You know what, Marshall?
let's not try to connect the dots, okay?
at least my dad took a little time off between families.
it wasn't, you know, concurrent.
anyway, he didn't ask for a second chance, let alone deserve one.
Hey, so the reservation?
Oh, yeah, listen, about that - Really?
I left, like, 39 messages. What do you want me to say? I haven't heard back.
I've been planning this for weeks, down to the last detail.
right, so go somewhere else.
Oh, my god. You got us in for Friday night?
no one gets in Friday night. - I do.
you're welcome, by the way.
I'll have to rethink my approach, but this is great.
she'll love this. I don't know how to thank you.
well, you can start by not sounding so surprised.
I mean, just because I have less than nothing in common with your southern fried Avon lady doesn't mean I'm unwilling to cosponsor your lame ass dating anniversary.
you're sweet. - Yeah, well... - Good night.
friday night at my favorite range.
your work wife came through.
so everyone just ...that's what they call her, my work wife?
nice shooting, Hopalong.
Oh, my god. Marshall.
take off your ears!
would you - Yes! Yes! - All right.
everyone thinks they want freedom, or at least they say they do.
the chance to choose whatever they want.
but choices come with consequences.
every time you make a choice, you also take a risk.
risks that, for better or worse, alter your options for the rest of time.
what's up, Delia?
all right, hang on.
missed me?
Ronnie Dowenberg Clown.
the affinity scammer.
I hate this guy.
we're moving you to a secure location.
your testimony will be rescheduled.
Oh, yeah.
daddy?
you're under arrest.
James is willing to hand them Sully on a silver platter.
thing is, Mary, he'll only talk to you.
if I ever left the fold, he'd kill my family.
dad... - What the hell?
listen to me, son. People come back.
you got any idea what Sully does to loose ends?
all they wanna do is bring Sully in.
the sooner you help them do that, the sooner Jinx and Brandi are out of the crosshairs.
we hook Sully with a little sample.
he'll set a meet.
Sully's making contact.
now say good-bye to your son.
no, no, Sully. No. No!
damn it! Shannon's gone awol!
he knocked out one of my guys and the EMT. He escaped on foot.
I know where he's going. He's going after Sully.
he's gonna kill the son of a bitch.
what makes you so sure? - Cause that's what I'd do.
my father probably should have taken his own advice. "Never trust your partner."
ESPANOLA, NEW MEXICO - 30 miles and closing, Stan. - Copy that.
can't believe he's going north. How does he not head straight for Juarez?
this isn't a Butch and Sundance deal, taking off for Mexico.
Bolivia--I've told you a thousand times, Butch and Sundance went to Bolivia.
whatever. The point is, his only son just got killed on his watch.
mother Teresa would want revenge.
you really think he'll kill him?
you're asking me? I don't know. I don't know him.
what we do know is his story about Sully checks out.
your family's clearly in danger.
he's turning off. Stan, he's turning off.
copy.
buenos dias. - Buenos dias.
excuse me, ma'am. U. S. Marshals.
have you seen this man? Show her the photo, please.
this man-- have you seen him?
Yes, I gave him a ride into town. Dropped him off about half an hour ago.
he traded me this necklace.
all right, Marshall. Do your polite thing real quick, would you?
I'm sorry, ma'am, we're gonna have to take that. It's evidence.
but he wanted me to have it.
and now the FBI wants you not to have it. Okay, enough chit-chat.
Marshall, grab the necklace. Let's go.
thank you.
location: CLASSIFIED
so here's a simple way to prop up the airline industry.
first-class corkage fee.
champagne, the real deal from...Champagne.
so I bring my own, peel off 20 bucks a pop in corkage. Easy money, heh.
am I right? Or am I right?
ask an artist how he knows he's finished with a painting, and odds are he'll say you never really know.
Paramus, NEW JERSEY Hey, Shannon. How the hell you been?
fantastic.
you seen Sully?
not since Carolina Savings.
heard that didn't go too good.
Yeah, well, heh. You're really not gonna like the way this goes.
put that down or I'll shoot you dead!
put it down!
I'm gonna ask you just one more time.
seen Sully? Think really hard about it.
I read somewhere Picasso used to touch up paintings on living room walls
smudges on canvas he'd sold years before.
like his relationships, like all of ours, his paintings lingered unfinished, somewhere between not quite dead and pulsing with life.
Hey, what the hell? FBI can't run a manhunt out of their shop?
the feebs love a good off-site.
Yeah. Plus, Delia's not messing around with these muffins.
God help me, they're good.
all right, folks, listen up. Listen up.
now, it goes without saying we got a fugitive right now with ties to this office.
now, there's no hard intel that he's coming after us, but James Shannon's associates...
that's another story. All bets are off.
till we locate him - and mark my words, we will - nobody gets sloppy.
don't.
I wouldn't dream of it, partner.
how the hell you track me down, Jimmy?
everybody's got a blind spot.
you think people are loyal to you.
that's not loyalty. It's fear.
you should never have gone freelance.
you should never have gone after my family.
Mary, can I have a word, please?
what's up?
Mary, I don't really know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it.
blood work came in an hour ago.
it was positive for acute myeloid leukemia.
your father's terminal.
am I supposed to believe you have cancer or
Yeah, the cancer's legit. I wish it wasn't.
I see.
you...want to talk about this?
no, I don't want to talk about it.
I don't need to get it out. I'm not sad, Stan. I'm pissed.
okay, I get it. Now, listen, until this all blows over, you're gonna need security.
no, I don't. - Not up for discussion.
you wanna recuse yourself from the manhunt, jump into the Dalembert testimony, - nobody's gonna bat an eye.- Yeah, right.
jump into the deep end with that ass-hat one more time - no thanks.
I'm on this.
no one brings in my father but me.
since 1970, the Federal Witness Protection Program has relocated thousands of witnesses
some criminal, some not - to neighborhoods all across the country.
every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, distinguishing them from the rest of the general population.
and that is, somebody wants them dead.
your cooking is finer than a Skeeter's eyelash.
you're doing it again. - What? People say that.
no, they don't, you're fabricating colloquialisms.
don't make me call Aunt Maybeline.
Oh, the ring. Gotta get this re-sized.
one ring to rule them all.
be safe out there, Frodo.
you get me. - Don't you forget it.
Oh, boy.
I'll pick up the Shiraz for the party. See you later.
this is the most time we've ever spent together.
I'm sorry it had to come on the security detail.
you think you're sorry?
Hey, Delia, I gotta tell you something.
you make weird coffee.
I put a little cardamom in it for an extra kick.
Yeah, like I said.
no way Sully's guys found us, right? No way.
there's always a way.
Mary?- Guess who was just followed.
on my way in, late model sedan, dark. Hung two cars back the whole time.
I lost him and came home.
you there now?
Yeah, Delia's with me.
and Norah's here and safe, but, Stan, Sully and his guys, they found me.
all right. Don't move. I'll loop in the feebs, up your security, all right?
you see anything, you call me.
I'm there in ten.
all right. Oh, hey, Stan
I'll have Marshall check on Jinx and Brandi. Don't move. You sit tight.
okay.
we got a problem.
Sully's guys tailed Mary out of her house this morning.
that's all you got? "Huh"?
cause I got one of my best inspectors compromised.
maybe you could fake a little concern...For fun.
those weren't Sully's men. They were mine.
inspector Shannon's under investigation for aiding and abetting the escape of James Shannon.
wait a second. You investigate one of my people without a heads-up?
with the written consent of opr, hell, yes, I did, pal.
the fact that I enjoy it, that's just gravy.
Yeah, well, no one from the office of professional responsibility has worked with Mary Shannon for a decade like I have.
not only that - first time she sees her father since she's this high, she cuffs him and dumps him in your lap.
she's got no reason to stick her neck out for the guy.
just ask her yourself, then duck!
Good...So I got your permission to talk to her, huh? That's what that sounded like.
until James Shannon is in an orange jumpsuit, no stone goes unturned.
Miami, FLORIDA Hey, Ginger.
what are you doing here?
just, uh-- I just wanted to say good-bye.
30 years later?
it's been too long, James. You should have left us alone.
no, no. Look. I got about-- I got 30 seconds.
that's all. There's marshals everywhere.
I needed to say thank you for the...
great job you did with our girls.
I mean, Mary, a U. S.marshal. Imagine that.
listen to me.
that deal you tried to cut with the feds, no way it was ever gonna pan out. I couldn't stay.
if I'd stayed, my crew would have marked me as a rat.
you never would have been safe with me around.
without you around, all I had to do was raise our girls.
and drink myself into a hole.
Oh, baby, I had no choice.
baby?
you know...You might not have ruined everything.
my girls are wonderful.
you ruined me for a long time.
you came through the other side.
look, I'm, uh-- I'm leaving for good. I-I'm taking my troubles with me.
you're safe now.
and, uh...
maybe you can give me five minutes head start.
just go.
you're following the wrong person, dickhead.
you know, you're gonna want to get some help for that anger problem.
I don't have an anger problem. I have a stupid problem.
call off the goddamn rat squad.
I call off the tail when you prove me wrong.
Hey, idiot, I'm the one who locked her own father, okay?
I got nothing but skin in this game.
your dad shows up out of the blue, after 30 odd years.
no contact at all.
what are these?
letters I've received from Daddy over the last 20 years or so.
I know. Weird, right?
suspicious more than weird, hence my investigation, during which you don't interfere, not a peep.
that's an order your boss signed off on. Are we clear?
my God. You're dumb as a box of hair.
don't you get it? I'm an asset!
Mary, we should get over to the court. You're due up in less than 20.
now, what's the deal, O'Connor?
you screw the pooch on the Sully takedown, so now you're running around trying to scare up a scapegoat?
the deal is, I'm gonna find your dad and hang this on you like a 50-pound sandbag.
Christ, snidely, shouldn't you be out there tying some girl to the rail road tracks?
Hey, Mom, what's up?
Mary... he was here.
he was - he was - he was - Slow down.
who was? Where are you?
Miami. Your father.
he was just here...At the grocery store.
Christ. All right, listen to me carefully.
are there marshals with you?
Yes. I'm with them now.
you do exactly what the marshals tell you, okay?
they're gonna want a statement.
a statement? C-c-can you handle it?
I can't, it's - it's just they told me
I'm not allowed to help with this investigation.
but you're okay?
Yeah. Except for the shaking, yeah.
good. Good. Look, I'm sorry, I-- Mom, I gotta go.
but you do exactly what they tell you, okay?
I'll call you later.- Okay, sweetheart.
let's go, Mrs. Shannon.
Florida? I'm all over it.
Hey, Mary. - Ronnie.
I'd say, "nice to see you," but the nuns drilled me good on lying, so...
I'm here representing the U. S.Marshal Service to ensure that Assistant U. S. Attorney Cistulli can adequately prep you for your testimony.
I'm also here to make sure everybody's protected, my office included.
there is one tiny-- it's not even tiny.
it's like miniscule thing before I hit the stand.
Oh, my God. - What?
I'm in love. - And?
I wanna bring her into the program.
the thing is, she's kind of got no idea that I'm a protected witness.
I just don't want to lie to her any more.
have you considered suicide?
I'd like to get this cleared up today. Um, she's back at the hotel.
wait. Here?
you brought her to Albuquerque?
Ronnie! - She begged me. I couldn't resist.
you brought a civilian into your danger area without clearance.
that's a breach, genius, and a major one.
you're out of leverage, Ronnie. You do realize that, right?
Oh... that is upsetting.
and, jeez, if I get upset, I might not perform very well on the stand and...
well, that'd be bad for, gosh, everybody drawing a paycheck from Uncle Sam.
you do realize that, right?
you listen to me, you lowlife SOB.
whatever you've got up your sleeve is not gonna work, not today.
it will, though. See, what this is is my exit strategy.
there are no short grifts, Mary.
not for any crook worth his salt, anyway.
he's got us in a box. I think we gotta bring her in, the girlfriend.
Hey, mare bear. Relax.
you are gonna love Charlotte. She's British.
Hey, Danny boy.
wow, James. I didn't see you there.
you seen Finn lately?
when you do see him, you tell him I'm looking for him.
we still got some unfinished business.
will you tell him that for me?
your milk's gone sour.
Hey. - Hey.
I was talking to Ronnie.
on purpose?
he got me thinking. What if my dad planned this whole thing?
this is a big one, Finn.
from the start.
I wouldn't put it past him.
I think the FBI's sitting on some shady merchandise.
you up for a field trip?
he's dying. You know?
I know, but you're under strict orders.
how's that usually go?
FBI HEADQUARTERS, ALBUQUERQUE Street value's at least 10 million. Intel on this is rock solid.
Thanks.
hey... So if I were someone who could tell things like this, how could I tell if these were fake?
ever gotten faux jewelry from a guy?
never gotten jewelry from a guy.
and don't say "faux."
right. So... These would be...
fake. They'd be fake.
meaning my father has the real ones.
his exit strategy.
Ronnie Dalembert, I swear to God.
so he swaps out the real stones and fences them to fund his getaway.
I'll get O'Connor and the fugitive task force up to speed.
inspector Mary Shannon?
who's asking?
you're in an FBI evidence room.
smart money's on the FBI is asking.
so her father went after Sully, just like she said he would.
right or wrong, this doesn't look good for her.
as of 30 minutes ago, Shannon hit the big time.
this isn't just unlawful flight any more.
now he's on the hook for murder.
Hey, O'Connor. What's with the Laverne and Shirley?
I didn't need a babysitter when I was seven, and I don't need one now.
Mary, listen, maybe we should just-- we found Cormac Sullivan.
capped. Your father's our primary suspect.
so when I tie you to his escape, you're staring at felony murder.
Oh, come on, O'Connor. That's a pretty big "if, " hmm?
I'm sorry, Mary. My hands are tied.
either these guys shadow you for a while, or you're on the rubber gun squad counting paper clips.
in other words, for the time being, the justice department and I think you could use a babysitter.
you're safe now. That's what he said to Jinx.
I tried to pretend that could have meant anything else, but it's pretty much a confession.
do I need a lawyer?
no. You didn't do anything.
maybe if you want to take a few days
I don't need a few days.
this is for you, sweetheart. You keep everyone safe.
Thanks, daddy.
it's rude, right, if we don't ask 'em in?
Mary, I'm so sorry about your father.
all of that. If there's anything I can do
Yeah, I'm good, thanks. Thank you.
I'll go grab the coffee.-Thanks, Ab.
unreal. Single mom, U.S. marshal, wanted for aiding and abetting an FBI fugitive, and he's her dad.
lifetime movie practically writes itself.
uh, nobody likes feeling out of control.
I don't, you certainly don't.
right now, everything is out of your control.
but instead of fighting it, I don't know, maybe just let things be out of control.
Yeah, cause I'm great at that.
what if we did just the tiniest bit of poking around Finn Murphy?
What'd I say?
don't worry-- by "we," I meant you.
come on, Kitty cat. Just look into him.
thank you.
got something.
we know Shannon needs to fence whatever stones he's got.
he knows we're on his tail, so he has to unload 'em fast.
fastest way to work is with someone you know.
Finn Murphy. Fugitive task force lost track of him.
Yeah, except I just got off the phone with special agent Romano back east.
his office puts Murphy on a plane to Denver.
FAA said they'd contact us when he's on final.
call the district.
have 'em intercept the plane - on the tarmac.
screw that. We coordinate with the marshals, but we run this on the ground, okay?
first good news I've had in days.
you. - Yes?
and Ronnie. - That's right.
wow, it's incredible how much I don't see it.
you'd be surprised. He can be quite winning.
but I'm the one who's a bit turned around.
Ronnie is a felon?
Yeah, okay, look.
I may not be miss BBC America, but I can spot a phony British accent.
not what I seem. In my old life, I hung around real dodgy types.
I have privileged information pertaining to the illegal dealings of Lorcan Kelley.
you're acquainted with Castle Trading?
my office is.
I could bring down Kelley and every one of his crooked traders, if I could just sidestep this pesky immigration issue.
I'll get into it.
the way it worked, Ronnie and me, was we were conning each other.
only I didn't see it. What can I say?
I've got a blind spot for Ronnie.
and that's no way to operate. That's how you get burned.
look, you want stuff done right, never trust your partner.
your blind spot?
everybody's got one.
betcha even you, love.
hate that these pricks can listen in on my phone.
God bless the Patriot Act.
quiet! Hold the chatter! We're on!
James Shannon is calling his daughter.
we're connected.
Hello?
Hey, sweetheart. Look, I'll make this quick.
we don't have a lot of time.
Yeah, we've got nothing but time. Heard you dropped in on Mom.
did she cry?
she always was a softie.
that's what I loved about her. What I hated about her too.
every emotion on her sleeve.
not easy when you're partial to tube tops, but that's Jinx.
all right, listen. There's no...
you know, easy way to ask this. So I'm just gonna ask it.
did you do it? Did you...kill Sully?
everything I did...I did to protect you.
to protect the family.
I'll take that as a yes. As for protecting the family
it's the truth.-Yeah, right. The truth.
cause that's your strong suit.
Look...Listen, Daddy...
Scott's dead. So is the guy who killed him.
you saw Jinx. You met your granddaughter.
just-- just turn yourself in.
okay, this doesn't have to go this way. We can get you treatment.
we can- No, no.
no, I don't want that.
I'm not going out sucking my lunch through a tube in some federal piss hole--no way.
fine. What do you want?
look...
sweetheart...
I lost everything, everybody.
you've already given me a lot more than I deserve.
you know, being with Norah this handful of times, it was, um
it was like I was looking at you. It was a gift.
daddy, just tell me where you are.
there's still time to do the right thing.
Yeah...Right thing.
Hey! Any coppers, marshals, FBI listening in, hear me and hear me good.
my daughter had nothing to do with anything I did. Nothing.
you hear me? Mary's not with me.
she's yours. Always was.
get it?- Hold on, give me a second. He's in Albuquerque.
he's at his goddamn safe house.
I want her gone, McQueen! Now!
let me just give you back my visitor's badge.
Oh, wait, that's right. You're in my office, asshole.
Mary - What?
I kept him on the phone. I am the epitome of playing ball!
why don't we just grab a coffee?
no, I don't want a coffee. I want to get out of here.
no big deal--Laverne and Shirley can keep an eye on me.
let's go, ladies. Chop-chop.
how the hell does this guy get past our people?
thought we had a detail out front.
this is what he does.
guy's been getting in and out of spots far more secure than his own backyard for decades.
got something'!
got something'!
so now you know what that feels like.
what's your problem, inspector?
if I had to narrow it down to just one,
I'd say accusing my partner of conspiring with a most-wanted is currently top of the list.
empty.
so we're saying Shannon came back for the real emeralds...
distracts us with a phone call, then takes off. Like that?
right, at which point, your guys miss him.
must have come during naptime.
yeah? How do you lose a guy at the airport? Yeah.
lost him in Denver.
Finn Murphy's MIA Again.
Impressive-- how do you guys find each other at a concert?
blind spot.
everybody's got one.
betcha even you, love.
that's how you get burned.
so our guys in Denver got a bite on Finn Murphy.
he's in the air right now.
wheels down in Las Cruces in less than 60.
if Shannon's meeting him there, it's to fence the stones and hop the border.
pretty clever, actually.
unbelievable.
agent O'Connor, call for you. Inspector Shannon.
what?- Aww, I missed you too. Just listen, okay?
I've got this witness, and she said something to me.
she said, "everyone's got a blind spot."
I can't believe I didn't remember this, but sometimes my father used a cover.
I mean, if I'm right, he'll be in a plumbing van.
it's how he used to slip in and out of places.
it's how he - Inspector...
this isn't your investigation.
we're not even in the neighborhood of your investigation.
don't make calls. Don't poke around.
whatever you're doing, stop.
we're going to the border to apprehend your father.
we'll do our best to keep him alive.
don't go to any trouble on my account. You're welcome.
Mary! I didn't expect to see you home.
Oh, hey. Yeah. It's been kind of a funny day.
Hey, bug. -Hey, mommy. Hello.
I have an idea. - What?
how about you and Norah go on a little adventure?
okay.- Yeah. Good.
here we go. Shannon's on the move.
10 miles north of the Mexican border. What the...
USA/MEXICO BORDER AHEAD Of course I wasn't followed. Cause I wanna do this fast, Finn.
my ride is here. Now...
don't tell me where you're headed.
don't you come looking for me.
11-46-2.
this your idea of a joke?
you're looking at the sample.
when you check out the other locker, you'll be staring at the rest.
I give that locker up just as soon as you complete your part of the transaction.
this is the kind of crap that got your boy killed.
I'll be home before you know it, kid.
you know what got Sully killed?
spite, temper, and ego.
so let's try and steer clear of all three, huh?
I'll call you back, just as soon as it transfers.
30 years we don't see each other. Now we're thick as thieves.
sweetheart. This isn't part of the plan.
Really? Getting arrested wasn't part of your plan?
you really are a pro. Put your hands where I can see 'em.
you're under arrest...Again.
God, you're good. FBI never got me.
I had a little help from a crap weasel conman I know.
snaky son of a bitch. You'd love him.
don't do this, huh?
you can walk away from this right now, partner, we both can.
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you? We're not partners.
you think this is, what, romantic?
like you're some badass antihero in everyone else's story?
cause you should know the rest of us are not your supporting cast.
I built a life without you.
I'll be damned if you showing up is gonna be my downfall.
I mean, I have a job when this is over.
but at least it'll be because of what I've done. What I've done.
let's go.
look, it's probably best we don't go out there.
we're going. Come on.
I don't trust this guy.
asshole's still in bed with the feds!
Mary, run!
get him! Get him!
Mary! Run! - What?
just go! Get the hell out of here!
I can't now. - I'm the one they're after!
I'm the one with the gun!
look around!
go! Go!
he'll show. He has to.
shots fired. Shots fired. He's at the bus station.
bus station? He's never here at the border!
Where'd he go? Find him!
where is he?
I don't know! I don't see him!
let me get in front and draw their fire.
shut up and stay behind me.
come on, we're moving. Let's move.
No!
FBI! Don't move! Federal agents!
let's see your hands! Right there!
Congratulations. Get down! Get down!
do not move!
Oh, my God. We need an ambulance.
what the hell are you doing here, Shannon?
get a goddamn ambulance!
when I left...
you had a... Suitcase...
with... flowers.
it's okay. It's okay.
we never did...
get... to take that trip.
it's okay. It's okay, Daddy.
I'm here with you now, okay? It's okay.
we never-- It's okay. I'm not going anywhere.
it's okay. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.
your father's a fighter.
when he came in, he was in hemorrhagic shock.
thank you.
he's stable now, enough to operate, but he lost a lot of blood and there a potential for solid organ damage.
and the truth is we don't really know what we're gonna find till we get in there.
Oh, okay.
as soon as we have an assess, I'll have one of the nurses call you.
Thanks. - Could be five or six hours.
sorry, I wish I could tell you more. - Thank you.
where do you think you're going? We're not finished.
what do you want, a formal after-action interview?
Christ, her father's in surgery.
you know, we are finished. My father went fugitive.
you couldn't find him, I did. Case closed.
be that as it may, I catch one whiff of impropriety out of you or your office, believe me, I will be all over you in a flat second.
you know what I would do if I were you?
I'd use this time to check out the leak in my shop.
meantime, we'll see what we can do on our end to keep your guys from getting any more of my family killed.
you know, one detail from your story did strike me as kind of hinky.
how'd you let a guy you're trying to bring in get in front of you when you were running from a shooter?
he just stepped out. There was no time.
went all secret service.
he protected you?
in that moment, yeah.
so your dad might not have been around. He screwed your family-- no arguments.
But...he passed on that one quality, even if that was it.
it's not nothing.
Yeah. I don't know.
I thought if I got him back, if I brought him in...
there'd be some sort of...
I don't know.
now it's just gonna drag out.
ten-to-one the asshole makes a historic recovery. Watch.
why don't you come over to our place?
everyone's gonna be there. Abigail promised not to cook.
Oh, I've been to your parties.
it's a catered book club and people shrieking about triple word scores.
okay, last-ditch sales effort. Stan's bringing his lady love.
Really? - Yeah.
it's tempting. No, I think I'm just gonna wait to hear.
all right.
let's see if we can do this on fast-forward, okay? Long day.
just triple-checking the language in our C. I. status.
your what? Their what?
you were busy with your family matter.
doj sweetened Ronnie and Charlotte's arrangement.
how badass is that?
our area of speciality being international money laundering.
Bad...ass.
just supposed to help them a little bit.
but you said - I know what I said.
whoo, yikes.
uh, how's that relocation disbursement coming along?
euros? We do that?
no, not you, but we're not WITSEC anymore.
we're Department of Justice C. I.'s.
and good riddance. But Euros, Cistulli? Really?
uh, I mean, yeah.
what kind of idiot keeps their cash in the U. S?
honestly.
everyone always says, "life isn't fair."
bad guys get away with the goods and the good die young.
but we carry on anyway, cause what other choice do we have?
not off my feet so much as out of one of my shoes.
but he's learning.- Baby steps, baby steps.
you take any other kind?- Come on.
I wanna see one little thing. Like a glove.
how'd you do that?
might have picked your pocket.
you had a lot on your plate, so I took care of it for you.
it's great.
Hello? Yeah. I'm on my way.
uh, I gotta take this. It's Mary.-Take it.
Hey. Okay, yeah. I'm on my way.
let me guess.
I'm so sorry.
no no. Don't apologize. She needs you. I get it.
in the face of "unfair," we carry on, holding our breath and bracing ourselves.
and only sometimes forgetting that there's always another storm right around the corner.
where is he?
where is he? Where's my father?
they'll hit you, the storms.
knock you off your moorings and send you overboard.
desperate for anything to hold on to, to reel you up towards some semblance of peace.
but life, I find, is often more about the storms than the peace they seek to overwhelm.
Hey! Come here! We have a man on the shore! I'm on my way.
are you here to kill me?
I know what this is.
I've seen one before. Many, many years ago.
it belonged to a man I met in a half-remembered dream.
a man possessed of some radical notions.
what is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus?
an intestinal worm?
what Mr. Cobb is trying to say... - An idea.
resilient. Highly contagious.
once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate.
an idea that is fully formed, fully understood that sticks.
right in there somewhere. - For someone like you to steal?
Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defense is lowered and it makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction.
the most skilled extractor. - How can I do that?
cause I am the most skilled extractor.
I know how to search your mind and find your secrets.
I know the tricks. And I can teach them to you so even when you're asleep your defense is never down.
look, if you want my help, you're gonna have to be completely open with me.
I need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife better than your therapist, better than anyone.
if this is a dream and you have a safe full of secrets
I need to know what's in that safe.
in order for this all to work, you need to completely let me in.
enjoy your evening, gentlemen. But I'll consider your proposal.
he knows.
what's going on up there?
saito knows. He's playing with us.
it doesn't matter. I can get it here. Trust me.
the information is in the safe. He looked right at it when I mentioned "secrets."
what's she doing here?
just head back to the room, alright. I'll take care of this.
okay, make sure you do. We're here to work.
if I jump, would I survive?
I thought you might be missing me.
you know that I am. But I can't trust you anymore.
so what?
looks like Arthur's taste.
actually, the subject is partial disposal of British painters.
please, have a seat.
tell me... Did the two kids miss me?
you can't imagine.
what are you doing? - Getting some fresh air. Stay where you are, Mal.
goddamn it.
turn around. - Put the gun down.
please.
now, the envelope Mr. Cobb.
did she tell you? Have you known all along?
that you're here to steal from me or that we are actually asleep?
I want to know the name of your employer.
there's no use in threatening within a dream right, Mal ?
that depends on what you're threatening. Killing him will just wake him up.
but pain...
pain is in the mind and judging by the decor we're in your mind right, Arthur?
what are you doing? It's too soon! - I know. But the dream has collapsed.
just try to keep Saito lie a little bit longer. We're almost there.
this place. The paintings.
stop him!
I think that's gonna work. Wake him up!
you awake!
give him the kick! - What?
drop him.
he's up.
you came prepared, hmm?
not even my head of security knows this apartment.
how did you find it?
it's very difficult for a man of your position to keep a love nest like this secret particularly when there's a married woman involved.
she will never... - Yet, here we are.
for the dilemma. - They're getting closer.
you got what you need. - Well, it's not true.
you left out a key piece of information, didn't you?
you held something back because you knew what we were up to.
an audition. - An audition for what?
doesn't matter. You failed.
we extracted every bit of information you had in there.
but your dream approach is obvious.
so leave me alone.
you don't seem to understand, Mr. Saito. The operation that hired us...
they won't accept failure. We won't last two days.
Cobb?
looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.
tell us what you know! Tell us what you know, now!
I've always hated this carpet.
it stain and fade in such distinctive ways. That way you know it's made of wool.
but now...
...a line of polyester.
which means I'm not lying on my carpet in my apartment.
you have lived after your reputation, Mr. Cobb. I'm still dreaming.
where did he go? - We're not getting paid.
dream within a dream, huh. I'm impressed.
but in my dream, you play by my rules.
Yes, but you see Mr. Saito... - We're not in your dream.
we're in mine.
asshole. How did you mess up the carpet?
it wasn't my fault. - You're the architect.
I don't know he's gonna rub his damn cheek on it! - That's enough.
you, what the hell is all that? - I have it under control.
I didn't see it under control.
we don't have time for this. I'm getting off at Kyoto.
Why? We still have to check every compartment.
I don't like trains. Listen.
every man for himself.
Yes, hello. - Hi, daddy.
Hi, dad.
hey guys, hey. How are you? How are you doing, huh?
good. - Okay, I guess.
okay? Who's just okay? Is that you, James? - Yeah, when are you coming home, dad?
well, I can't sweetheart. I can't.
it's not for a while, remember? - Why?
I told you, I'm away because I'm working, right?
grandma says you're never coming back.
Phillipa, is that you? Put grandma on the phone for me, will you?
she's shaking her head.
let's just hope she's wrong about that.
is Mommy with you?
James, we've talked about this. Mommy's not here anymore.
that's enough, kids. Say bye bye.
listen, I wanna send some presents with grandpa, alright?
and you be good, you be...
our ride's on the roof. - Alright.
are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Why? - Locked down in a dream, Mal showing up.
sorry about your leg, it won't happen again.
it's getting worse, isn't it?
one apology is all you're getting huh, Arthur.
Where's Nash ? - He hasn't shown. You wanna wait?
two hours ago. By now, they know we failed. It's time we disappear.
where would you even go? - Buenos Aires.
I'll cut my load, I may slip out a job when things quiet down.
you? - States, sir.
send my regards.
he sold the art. Fell off the company and bargained for his life.
so I offer you the satisfaction.
it's not the way I deal with things.
what will you do with him? - Nothing.
but I can't speak for Cobol Engineering.
what do you want from us? - Inception.
is it possible? - Of course not.
if you can steal an idea from someone's mind why can't you plant one idea instead.
okay, here's me planting an idea in your head. I say to you...
don't think about elephants."
what are you thinking about? - Elephants.
right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you.
the subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea.
true inspiration's impossible to fake. - It's not true.
can you do it? - Are you offering me a choice?
cause I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
you don't need to have a choice. - And I choose to leave, sir.
tell the crew where you want to go.
Hey, Mr. Cobb!
how would you like to go home? To America ?
to your children? - Can't fix that!
no one can! - Just like inception.
Cobb, come on.
how complex is the idea?
simple enough. - No idea is simple...
when you need to plant it in somebody else's mind.
my main competitor is an old man in poor health
his son will soon inherit control of the corporation.
I need him to decide to break up his father's empire.
Cobb, we should walk away from this. - Hold on.
if I were to do this...If I even could do it I need a guarantee
how do I know you can deliver?
you don't
but I can. So, do you want to take a leap of faith?
or become an old man filled with regrets, waiting to die alone?
assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely.
look, I know how much you wanna go home.
but this can't be done. - Yes, it can.
you just have to go deep enough. - You don't know that.
I've done it before.
who'd you do it to?
are we going to Paris?
we're gonna need a new architect.
you never did like your office, did you?
no space to think in that room covered.
is it safe for you to be here?
extradition between France and the United States is a bureaucratic nightmare, you know that.
I think they might find a way to make it work in your case
look, I.brought this for you to give to the kids when you have a chance.
it will take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father.
I'm just doing what I know.
I'm doing what you taught me. - I never taught you to be a thief.
no, you taught me to navigate people's minds but after what happened
they wanna hold our legitimate ways for me to use that skill.
what are you doing here, Dom?
I think I found a way home.
it's a job for some very very powerful people.
people who I believe can fix my charges permanently.
but I need your help. - You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
you know what I'm offering. You have to let them decide for themselves.
money. - Not just money. You remember. It's...
the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities, things that never existed.
things that couldn't exist in the real world.
so, you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy.
they don't actually come in to the dream. They just design the levels...
and teach them to the dreamers. That's all.
design it yourself.
mal won't let me.
come back to reality, Dom. Please.
those kids, your grandchildren- they're waiting for their father to come back home.
that's their reality. And this job, this last job that's how I get there.
I would not be standing here if I knew any other way.
I need an architect who's as good as I was.
I got somebody better. Ariadne?
I'd like you to meet, Mr. Cobb.
please to meet you. - If you have a few moments...
Mr. Cobb has a job offer he'd like to discuss with you.
is the work pretty soon? - Not exactly.
I have a test for you. - You're not gonna tell me anything about this first?
before I describe the job, I have to know you can do it.
Why? - It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
two minutes, design a maze that it takes one minute to solve.
stop.
again.
stop.
you have to do better than that.
that's more like it.
they say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now, that's when we're awake.
when we're asleep, the mind can do almost anything.
such as? - Well, imagine you're designing a building, right?
but sometimes, it feels like it's almost creating itself. If you know what I mean.
Yeah, yeah. Like, uhmm, discovering. - Genuine inspiration, right?
now in a dream, our mind continuously does this. We...
create and perceive our world simultaneously.
and our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.
that allows us to get right into the middle of that process.
how? - By taking over the creating part.
now, this is where I need you. You create the world of the dream.
we bring the subject into that dream.
how can I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality.
well, dreams they feel real while we're in them, right?
it's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.
let me ask you a question. You never really remember the beginning of a dream, do you?
you always wind up right in the middle of what's going on.
I guess, yeah. - So how did we end up here?
well, we just came from the... - Think about it, Ariadne.
how did you get here? Where are you right now?
we're dreaming? - You're actually in the middle of the workshop right now, sleeping.
and this is your first lesson in shared dreaming, so there you go.
if it's just a dream then why are you...
it's never just a dream, is it? When your face is full of glass feels like hell. When you're in it, it feels real.
it's what the military developed. During that time, it was a training program for soldiers to shoot and stab and strangle each other and then wake up?
how did architects think they belong?
well, someone had to design the dreams, right?
we were talking for like at least an hour.
in a dream, your mind functions more quickly therefore...
time seems to feel more slow.
five minutes in the world gives you an hour in the dream.
why don't we see what you can get up to in five minutes?
we got the basic layout. Bookstore, cafe.
who are the people? - Projections of my subconscious.
yours? - Yes. Remember, you are the dreamer.
you built this world. I am the subject, my mind populates it.
you can literally talk to my subconscious.
that's one of the ways we extract information from a subject.
how else do you do it? - By creating something secure, like a...
like a bank vault or a jail.
the mind automatically fills it with information it's trying to protect.
understand? - Then you break in and steal it.
well...
I guess I thought that the dream space should be all about the visual but it's more about the feel of it.
my question is, what happens when you start messing with the physics of it all?
something, isn't it? - Yes, it is.
why are they all looking at me?
cause my subconscious feels that someone else is creating this world.
the more you change things, the quicker the projections start to converge them.
Converge? - It sense the foreign nature of the dreamer.
this is great but I'm telling you, if you keep changing things like this...
Jesus. Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
it's my subconscious. Remember, I can't control it.
very impressive.
I know this bridge. This place is real, isn't it?
Yeah, I cross it everyday to get to the college.
never recreate places from your memory.
always imagine new places.
well, you gotta draft from stuff you know, right?
only use details. A street lamp or a phone booth.
never entire areas. - Why not?
because building a dream from your memory is the easiest way to lose your grasp from what's real and what is a dream.
is that what happened to you?
listen to me. This has nothing to do with me, understand?
is that why you need me to build your dreams?
get off of her. Back up.
back up! - Cobb!
get off me! - Let me go!
don't! Mal! - Cobb!
mal! - Wake me up!
Mal, No! No! - Wake me up!
Mal, no!
Hey, hey, hey, look at me. You're okay.
you're okay. - Why...why wouldn't I wake up?
cause there were still some time on the clock and you can't wake up within a dream unless you die.
show me the totem. - What?
a totem, it's a small, personal... - That's some subconscious you got on you, Cobb!
she's a real charmer. - Oh I see, you met Mrs. Cobb.
she's his wife. - Yeah. So, a totem.
you need a small object to potentially have you... something you have all the time.
that no one else knows.
like a coin? - No. It must be more unique than that.
this is a loaded die.
I can't let you touch it. That would defeat the purpose.
only I, know the balance and the weight of this particular loaded die.
that way, when you look at your totem,
you know beyond a doubt that you're not in someone else's dream.
I don't know if you can't see what's going on or if you just don't want to but Cobb has some serious problems that he's trying to bury down there.
and I'm not about to just open my mind to someone like that.
she'll be back. I've never seen anyone pick it up that quickly before.
reality is not gonna be enough for her now. And when she comes back...
if she comes back, you're gonna have her building mazes.
where are you gonna be? - I gotta go visit Eames.
Eames? No, he's in Mombasa. It's Cobol's backyard.
it's a necessary risk. - There is plenty of good thieves.
we don't just need a thief. We need a forger.
you can rub them together all you want, but they're not gonna breed.
you'll never know. - Let me get you a drink.
you might.
your spelling hasn't improved. - Test me.
how's your handwriting?
the best in town. - Good.
thank you very much.
no, it's perfectly possible. It's just bloody difficult.
interesting. - So Arthur keeps telling me it can't be done.
Arthur... You still work with that stick and mind?
he's good at what he does, right? - Oh, he's the best. He has no imagination.
not like you.
listen, if you're gonna perform inception you need imagination.
let me ask you something. Have you done it before?
we tried it. We got the idea in place. But it didn't take.
you didn't plant it deep enough? - No, it's not just about depth.
you need the simplest version of the idea in order for it...
to grow naturally in your subjects. Mind is a very subtle art.
so what is this idea that you need to plant?
we need the heir of a major corporation to dissolve his father's empire.
well. you see right there, you have various political motivations and anti-manipulistic sentiments to set forth.
and with all that stuff, it's really at the mercy of your subject's prejudice.
and what you have to do is start with the absolute basic.
which is what? - The relationship with the father.
do you have a chemist? - No, not yet.
alright, well there is a man here. Yusuf. He formulate his own versions of the compounds.
when are you taking me there? - Once you lost your tail.
men at the bar. - Cobol Engineering.
that price on my head, was that dead or alive?
I don't remember. Let's see if they start shooting.
run interference. I'll meet you downstairs in the bar in, say, in half an hour.
be back here? - It's the last place they'd suspect.
alright.
Freddy ! Freddy Simmons. My God, it's you, isn't it?
who? - No, it isn't.
you're not dreaming now, are you?
stay out!
no, cafe. One cafe.
cafe.
care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
what are you doing in Mombasa? - I need to protect my investments.
Ah, so this is your idea of losing your tail, huh.
different tail.
Cobb said you'd be back.
I tried not to come, but... - But there's nothing quite like it.
it's just... pure creation.
shall we take a look at some paradoxical architecture? You're gonna have to master a few tricks if you're gonna build three complete dream levels.
excuse me. - What kind of tricks?
in a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.
that lets you create closed loops. Like the Penrose Steps.
infinite staircase.
see?
paradox. So a closed loop like that will help you disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.
how big do these levels have to be?
it could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.
but they have to be complicated enough...
that we can hide from the projection.
and the better the maze... - Then the longer we have...
...before the projections catch us? - Exactly.
my subconscious seems quiet enough.
you wait till it turns ugly.
no one likes to feel someone else is messing around with their mind.
Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
I don't know if he can't, but he won't.
he thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts.
Why? - He won't tell me.
but I think it's Mal.
his ex-wife? - No, not his ex.
they're still together? - No, she's...
she's dead.
what you're seeing there is just his projection of her.
what was she like in real life? - She's lovely.
you are seeking a chemist? - Yes.
to formulate compounds for a job?
and to go into the field with us. - No, I rarely go into the field, Mr. Cobb.
we'd need you there to tell the compounds specific to our needs.
which are? - Great depth.
a dream within a dream? Two levels?
three.
not possible. That many dreams within dreams is too unstable.
it is possible you just had to have a sedative. - Well, powerful sedative.
how many team members? - Five
six.
the only way to know you've done the job is if I am with you.
there's no room for tourists on a job like this, Mr. Saito.
this time, it seems there is.
this, I think, is a good place to start. I use it everyday.
what for? - Yeah, I'll show you.
perhaps you will not want to see. - After you.
six, ten, twelve. All connected, bloody animal.
they come everyday to share the dream.
you see? Very stable.
how long do they dream for? - Three, four hours, each day.
and the dream time? - With this compound?
about forty hours, each and every day. - Why do they do it?
tell him, Mr. Cobb.
after a while it becomes the only way you can dream.
do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?
they come here everyday to sleep? - No.
they come to be woken up. The dream has become their reality.
who are you to say otherwise, huh?
let's see what you can do.
you know how to find me.
you know what you have to do.
sharp enough?
are you alright, Mr. Cobb?
Yeah, yeah. I'm just fine.
robert Fischer, heir to the Fischer-Morrow energy conglomerate.
what's your problem with this Mr. Fischer?
that's not your concern.
Mr. Saito, this isn't your typical corporate espionage.
you asked me for inception. I do hope you understand the gravity of that request.
the seed that we plant in this man's mind will grow into an idea.
this idea will define him. It may come to change...
it may come to change everything about him.
we're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance.
we can no longer compete. Soon, they'll control the energy supply of half the world. In effect, they become a new superpower.
the world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind.
that's where we come in. How is Robert Fischer's relationship with his father?
rumor is, the relationship is quite complicated.
but we can't work based solely on rumor, can't we?
can you get me access to this man here? Browning, Fischer Sr's right hand man.
Fischer Jr's godfather.
it should be possible. If you can get the right references.
references are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
I'm not smelling settlement here. Take them down.
Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation.
shall we voice your concerns with Maurice directly?
not sure if that's necessary. - No, no, no. I think we should.
how is he? I don't wanna bother him unnecessarily, but...
no, don't speak, Mr. Fischer.
follow through!
never. Never gonna send what I asked.
leave town.
terrible.
I put it beside his bed. He hasn't even noticed.
Robert...we need to talk about the power of attorney.
I know this is hard right now. - Not now, Uncle Peter.
but it's imperative that we start to...
the vultures are circling.
the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more powerful Peter Browning becomes.
I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning...
adopt his physical presence, study his mannerisms, and so on and so forth.
now, in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.
and suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.
then, when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should, should feedback right back to him.
so he gives himself the idea. - Precisely.
that's the only way it will stick. He has to see himself generate it.
Eames, I am impress.
your confession, has always as much appreciated, Arthur, thank you.
were you going out there on your own?
no, no. I was just... just running some experiments.
I didn't realize anyone was here. So...
Yeah, I was just, I was working on my totem actually. - Here, let me take a look.
so you're learning, huh?
an elegant solution for keeping track of reality.
was it your idea? - No, it was...it's Mal's, actually.
this. This one was hers. You spin it in a dream and it would never topple.
Just...spin and spin.
Arthur told me she past away. - How are the mazes coming on?
each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious that...
we are trying to access.
so, making the bottom level, hospitals. So Fischer will bring his father.
actually I have a question about this layout.
no, no, no. Don't show me specifics. Only the dreamer should know the layout.
why is that so important?
in case one of us brings in our projections we don't want them knowing the details of the maze.
you mean, in case you bring Mal in.
well, you can't keep her out, can you? - Right.
you can't build because if you know the maze then she knows it.
which should sabotage the whole operation.
Cobb, did the others know? - No. No, they don't.
you gotta warn them if this is getting worse.
no one said it's getting worse.
I need to get home. That's all I care about right now.
why can't you go home? - Because they think I killed her.
thank you. - For what?
for not asking whether I did.
that's why we need to plant it deep in the subconscious.
subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason.
we need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.
how do you translate a business strategy to an emotion?
that's what we're here to figure out, right?
now, Robert's relationship with his father is stressed, to say the least.
I can't remember that.
because suggesting him to break up his father's company is a "screw you" to the old man.
no, cause I think positive emotion...
triumphs negative emotion everytime.
we're all hearing for a reconciliation. A catharsis.
we need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.
alright, well, try this.
my father accepts that I want to create for myself not follow in his footsteps.
that might work. Might.
we're gonna need to do a little better than might.
forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames.
Specificity? - Inception is not about being specific.
on the top level, we open up his relationship with his father.
and seed... "I will not follow in my father's footsteps."
and the next level down, we feed him with: "I will create something for myself."
by the time we hit the bottom level, we bring out the big guns.
my father doesn't want me to be him. - Exactly.
with three layers down, the dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
we have to combine with an extremely powerful sedative.
good night.
the compound that'll be used to share the dream creates avery clear connection between dreamers plus actually accelerating brain function.
in other words, it gives us more time on each level.
brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.
when you enter a dream within that dream the effect is compounded.
it's three dreams, that's 10 hours, that's twenty... - I'm sorry, math is never my strong subject.
how much time is that? - It's a week the first level down.
six months the second level and the third level...
is ten years.
depends on the dream.
so once we've made the plants how do we get out?
I'm hoping you have something more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head.
a kick. - What's a kick?
this, Ariadne, would be a kick.
it's that feeling of falling, you get the jolts, you awaken snaps you out of the dream.
are we gonna feel a kick with this kind of sedation?
Oh, that's the counterpart.
I've customized it to leave any ear function unimpaired.
that way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper still feels falling.
or tipping.
the trick is to synchronize a kick that can penetrate all three levels.
we can use a musical content to synchronize the different kicks.
he doesn't have any surgery scheduled, No dental, nothing.
wasn't he suppose to have a knee operation?
nothing. Nothing that will put him under for any REM. We need...We need at least a good ten hours.
sydney to Los Angeles.
one of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks.
and he must be flying private.
not if there were unexpected maintenance with his plane.
but that should be a 747. - Why is that?
and the first class cabin is in the nose. So no one would walk through.
but you'd have to buy out the entire cabin. And the first class flight.
I bought the airline. It seemed little.
well, looks like we have our ten hours.
Ariadne? Terrific work, by the way.
do you remember when you ask me to marry you?
of course I do. - You said you had a dream.
that will grow old together.
and we can.
you shouldn't be here.
I just want to see what kind of tests you're doing here alone every night.
whatever it was, it has nothing to do with you. - It has everything to do with me.
you've asked me to share dreams with you. - Not these. These are my dreams.
why do you do this to yourself? - It's the only way I can still dream.
why is it so important to dream? - In my dreams, we're still together.
these aren't just dreams.
these are memories and you said never to use memories.
I know I did. - You're trying to keep her alive.
you can't let her go. - You don't understand.
these are moments that I regret and memories that I have to change.
Oh, what's down there that you regret?
listen, I do know one thing that you need to understand about me.
is this your house? - Mine and Mal's, yes.
where is she? - She's already died.
that's my son, James. He's digging for something, maybe a worm.
that's Phillipa.
you see, I thought about calling out to them so they'd turn and smile and I can those those beautiful faces of theirs but...it's all too late.
right now, or never, Cobb.
then I start to panic. I realized I don't want to regret this moment that...
I need to see their faces one last time.
James! Phillipa! Come on in!
but the moment's passed.
and whatever I do, I can't change this moment.
so I'm about to call out to them and run away.
if I'm ever gonna see their faces again, I've gotta get back home.
the real world.
what are you doing here? - My name is...
I know who you are. What are you doing here?
I'm just trying to understand. - How could you understand?
do you know what it is to be a lover?
to be half in a whole? - No.
I'll tell you a riddle.
you're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away.
you know where you hope this train will take you. But you don't know for sure.
but it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where the train will take you?
cause we will be together.
how could you bring her here, Dom? - What is this place?
this is the hotel suite where we should spend our anniversary.
what happened here?
you promised! You promised we'll be together!
please, I need you stay here! Just for now!
you said we'll be together! You said we'll grow old together!
do you think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in?
do you really think that that's gonna contain her?
it's time. Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
when is the funeral? - Thursday, in Los Angeles.
robert should accompany the body no later than Tuesday. We should move.
right.
Cobb, I'm coming with you. - I promised Miles, no.
the team needs someone who understands what you're struggling with.
and it doesn't have to be me.
but then you have to show Arthur what I just saw.
get us another seat on the plane.
if I get on this plane and you don't honor our agreement.
when we land, I go to jail for the rest of my life.
complete the job on board. I'll make one phone call from the plane.
you will have no trouble getting through Immigration.
Yes, it is. - Thanks.
Yes.
third seat on the right. - Thanks.
I'm sorry. - Oh yeah, I'm sorry, my bad.
fasten SEAT BELTS. NO SMOKING.
excuse me, I think this is yours? You must've dropped it.
gentlemen, can I have your drink? - Oh, water please.
the same, please.
thank you.
you know I couldn't help but notice but you won't happen to be related to...
the Maurice Fischer," would you?
Yes, he...he was my father. - Well he was a very inspiring figure.
I'm sorry for your loss. - Sir.
here you go. - Thank you.
Hey, to your father. May he rest in peace, huh.
you couldn't have peed before you went on there.
sorry.
pitching much free champagne before take off, right, Yusuf?
haha. Bloody hard.
well now, he's gonna be looking for a taxi in this weather.
asshole! Hey man, why don't you try... - Walk away.
look, I gotta go. Alright. Taxi. Thank you.
alright. Third and Market. Snappy.
what are you doing?
Oh sorry, I thought it was free. - Well, it's not.
maybe we could share. - Maybe not.
can you pull over and get this...
great.
come on!
there's $500 in there and the wallet's worth more than that.
so you might as well drop me at my stop.
I'm afraid that this...
cover him!
No! No! No! What was going on?
this wasn't in my design.
Cobb? Cobb?
get him!
are you alright? - Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Fischer's okay. Unless he gets carsick.
Saito?
get Fischer in the back room now!
get him the back room! - What the hell...
has he been shot? Is he dying? - I don't know.
Jesus Christ.
where were you? What happened to you? - The girl played a freight train.
why did you put a train crossing in the middle of a downtown interstate?
I didn't. - Where did it come from?
let me ask you a question! Why the hell were you ambushed?
those were not normal projections! They've been trained for God's sakes!
you're right. - How can they be trained?
Fischer had an extractor that teaches subconscious to defend itself.
so his subconscious is militarized.
it should've shown in the research. I'm sorry.
so why the hell didn't it? - Calm down.
don't tell me to calm down. This was your job, goddamn it!
this was your responsibility! You were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly!
we are not prepared for this type of violence!
we have dealt with self-security before!
we'll be a little more careful and we're gonna be fine!
this was not a part of the plan! He's dying for God's sake!
now, let's put him out of his misery. - No, no!
don't do that! - What's the matter, Cobb?
don't do that - He's in agony, I'm waking him up.
no, it won't wake him up. - What do you mean, it won't wake him up?
it won't wake him up. - When we die in a dream, we wake up.
not from this. We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
right, so what happens when we die? - We drop in a limbo.
are you serious? - Limbo?
Unconstructed dream space. - What the hell is down there?
just raw infinite subconscious. Nothing is down there.
except for whatever might have been left behind by anyone sharing the dream
how long can we be stuck there?
I can't even think about trying to escape until the sedation is...
how long, Yusuf? - Decades, It could be infinite. I don't know.
ask him he's the one who's been there.
just get him upstairs.
great. Thank you.
so, now we're trapped in Fischer's mind battling his own private army...
and if we get killed, we'll be lost in limbo till our brains turn to scrambled egg, hmm?
you got first aid?
so you knew about this risk and you didn't tell us?
there weren't meant to be any risk cause I didn't know we'd be dealing with a load of gunfire.
you had no right - It was the only way to go three layers deep.
and you, you knew about this and went along with it? - I trusted him.
you trusted him. What? Did he promise you half his share?
no. His whole share. It's like he said, he'd done it before.
he'd done it before, what, with Mal? Cause that worked so good?
it has nothing to do with it. I did what I had to do to get back to my children.
so you lead us into a war zone with no way out.
there is a way out. Alright, we continue on with the job and we do this as fast as possible.
and we get out using the kick. Just like before.
forget it, If we go any deeper we'll just raise the stakes.
I am sitting this one out on this level, boys.
Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak.
ten hours of flight time is a week at this level.
that means each and every one of us will be killed. That I can guarantee.
we have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible.
downwards is the only way forward.
get ready. You, come on let's go shake him up.
I'm insured against kidnapping for up to ten million.
this should be very simple. - Shut up! It won't be.
in your father's office, below the bookshelf is his personal safe.
we need the combination. - I don't know any safe.
it doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
tell us what it is. - I don't know.
we have an old good authority you do know.
yeah? Who is this authority?
$500, this cost?
what's inside? - Cash cards, ID, and this.
useful? - Maybe.
you're on. We've got an hour. - An hour?
I was supposed to have all night to practice.
saito wasn't supposed to be shot in the chest.
we got one hour, now get use something useful, please.
what's that? - Good authority.
uncle Peter...
no, no.
just make him stop. - The combination.
I don't know it. - Why does Browning say you do?
I don't know. Just let me talk to him and I'll find out.
you have one hour. Start talking.
are you alright?
are you okay?
those bastards bad at me for two days.
they have someone with access to your father's office and they're trying to open his safe.
Yeah. - They said I'd know the combination. But I don't know it.
Yeah, neither do I. - What?
Maurice told me that when he past, you were the only to be able to open it.
no, he never gave me any combination.
well, what then?
I don't know. Some meaningful combination of numbers based on your experiences with Maurice.
we didn't have very... many meaningful experiences together.
perhaps after your mother died.
after my mother died, you know what he told me?
Robert, there's really nothing to be said. - Oh well, he was bad with emotion.
I was eleven, Uncle Peter.
how is he doing? - He's in a lot of pain.
when we get down to the lower levels, the pain will be less intense.
and if he dies? - Worst case scenario?
when he wakes up, his mind is completely gone.
Cobb, I will still honor the arrangement. - I appreciate that, Saito.
but when you wake up you won't even remember that we had an arrangement.
limbo is gonna become your reality.
you're gonna be lost down there so long that you're gonna become an old man.
filled with regret? - Waiting to die alone.
no, I'll come back. And we will be alive together again.
breath.
these people are gonna kill us if we don't give them the combination.
they just want a ransom. - I heard them.
they're gonna whack us in that van and then drive it into the river.
alright. What is in the safe? - Something for you.
Maurice always said it was his most precious gift to you.
a will.
Maurice's Will is with Port and Dunn.
that's an alternate. This would supercede the other if you wanted to.
it splits off the component business of Fischer-Morrow
and it'd be the end of the entire empire as we know it.
destroy my whole inheritance. Why would he suggest that, you think?
I just don't know. He loved you, Robert.
in his own way. - In his own way?
at the end, he called me into his deathbed
and he could barely speak.
but he took the trouble to tell me one last thing.
he pulled me closer. And I could only make out... one word.
disappointed."
when were you in limbo?
you might have the rest of the team convinced to carry on with this job but they don't know the truth.
truth? What truth?
the truth that at any minute, you might bring a freight train through the wall.
the truth that Mal is bursting through your subconscious.
and the truth that as we go deeper into Fischer we're also going deeper into you.
and I...I'm not sure we're gonna like what we find.
we were working together. We were exploring the concept of a dream within a dream.
I kept pushing things. I wanted to go deeper and deeper. I wanted to go further.
I just didn't understand the concept that hours could turn into years down there.
that we could get trapped so deep. That when we...
when wind up on the shore of our subconscious we lost side of what was real.
we created. We built a world for ourselves.
we did that for years. We built our own world.
how long were you stuck there? - Something like fifty years.
Jesus. How could you stand it?
it wasn't so bad at first. Feeling like gods.
the problem was that I knew that none of that was real.
eventually, it has became impossible for me to live like that.
and what about for her?
she has locked something away. Something deep inside her.
the truth that she once known. She chose to forget.
limbo became her reality.
what happened when you woke up?
well, to wake up from that after, after years, after decades...
to become old souls thrown back into youth like that...
I knew something was wrong with her. She just wouldn't admit it.
eventually, she told me the truth. She was possessed by an idea.
this one, very simple idea that changed everything.
that our world wasn't real.
that she needed to wake up to come back to reality, that...
in order to get back home... We had to kill ourselves.
what about your children? - She thought they were projections.
that our real children are waiting for us out there somewhere.
look, Cobb! I'm their mother. - Calm down.
can't you even tell the difference?
if this is my dream, why can't I control this?
because you don't know you're dreaming!
she was certain there was nothing I could do, no matter how much I begged...
no matter how much I pleaded.
she wanted to do it. But she could not do it alone.
she loved me too much so... She came up with a plan on our anniversary.
sweetheart, what are you doing? - Join me.
just step back inside, alright? Just step back inside now, come on.
no. I'm going to jump and you're coming with me. - No, I'm not. But now, you listen to me.
if you jump, you're not gonna wake up, remember?
you're gonna die. Now, just step back inside, come on. Step back inside so we can talk about this.
we've talked enough.
Mal. - Come out unto the ledge or I'll jump right now.
okay.
we're gonna talk about this. Alright?
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith. - No, honey.
I can't. You know, I can't do that.
take a second and think about our children.
think about James. Think about Phillipa, now.
if I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway.
what does that mean?
I filed a letter with our attorney explaining how I'm fearful for my safety.
how you threatened to kill me.
why did you do that? - I love you, Dom.
why did you.why... why would you do this to me?
I've freed you from the guilt of choosing to leave them.
we're going home. To our real children.
no, no, no, no, Mal, you listen to me! Alright? Mal, look at me, please.
you're waiting for a train.
Mal, goddamn it! Don't do this! - A train that will take you far away.
James and Phillipa are waiting for you! - You know where you hope this train will take you.
they're waiting for us! - But you can't know for sure.
Mal, look at me! - But it doesn't matter.
Mal, goddamn it! - Because you will be together.
sweetheart, look at me! Mal, no! Jesus Christ!
she had herself declared sane by three different psychiatrists.
that made it impossible for me to try to explain the nature of her madness.
so, I ran...
right now, or never, Cobb.
alright, let's go.
I left my children behind and I've been trying to buy myself back ever since.
your guilt defines her. It's what powers her.
but you are not responsible for the idea that destroyed her.
and if we are gonna succeed in this...
you have to forgive yourself. You're gonna have to confront her.
but you don't have to do that alone.
no, no, you don't... - I'm doing it for the others.
because they have no idea of the risk they've taken coming down here with you.
we have to move.
time's up. - Alright. I don't know any combination.
not consciously anyway. - How about instinctively, huh?
I got somebody standing in front of his office right now ready to tap in the combination.
I need the first six numbers that come to your head right now.
I have no idea. - Right now!
I said right now! Right now! - 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 1.
you'd have to do better than that.
alright. Gag him. We're going for a ride.
what more do you like? To kill me?
what did you get?
that boy's relationship with his father is even worse than we imagined.
the stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis.
how are you gonna reconcile then pursue his strengths?
well I'm working on that, don't I? - Move fast.
projections are closing in quick.
we gotta break out of here before we're totally boxed in.
damn it.
you mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling.
now, we need to shift his animosity from his father to his godfather.
we're gonna destroy his one positive relationship?
no, we'll repair his relationship with his father by exposing his godfather's true nature.
we should thrice Fischer's loot more than Saito's mission.
what about his security? It's gonna get worse as we go deeper.
no, I think we're going with Mr. Charles. - No.
who's Mr. Charles? - A bad ides.
the second we get into that hotel and approach Fischer his security will be all over us. We run with Mr. Charles like we did on this timed job.
so, you've done it before? - Yeah, and it didn't worked.
the subject realized that he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
excellent. But you've learned a lot, right?
I need some kind of distraction.
no problem. How about a lovely lady that I've used before?
listen to me. You drive carefully, alright? - Yeah.
getting down there is gonna be unstable as hell.
don't jump too soon. We only have one shot at that kick you're gonna make.
I'll play the music and you'll know it's coming, the rest is on you.
are you ready? - Ready!
sweet dreams.
am I boring you?
I was telling you my story. I guess it wasn't to your liking.
I have a lot in my mind.
there goes Mr. Charles.
Mr. Fischer, right?
pleasure to see you again. Rod Green from marketing.
and you must be? - Leaving.
in case you get bored.
she must have blown you off.
that is unless her phone number really is only six digits.
528-491
funny way to make friends, someone stealing their wallet like that.
goddamn it. The wallet alone is worth at least...
$500, right?
listen, don't worry about it. My people are already on it as we speak.
who or what is Mr. Charles?
it's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
and why don't you approve?
cause it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming'
which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
so Cobb said he couldn't do that?
so now you've noticed how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
Mr. Saito, may I have a moment?
I'm sorry, but... - Wait!
you looked to be "livelier." - Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
turbulence on the plane?
no, I mean, it's must closer. It's Yusuf's driving.
I'm sorry, who did you say you were? - Rod Green from marketing.
that's not true at all, is it?
my name is Mr. Charles. You remember me, don't you?
I'm the head of your security down here.
get out on a different floor and keep moving.
dump the wallet. The security will look for that.
okay. - We need to buy Cobb a lot more time.
security, huh?
you work for the hotel? - No, no.
I specialize in a very specific type of security. Subconscious security.
are you talking about dreams? Are you talking about extraction?
I am here to protect you. Look...
excellent work. Now, what is your plan?...
Mr. Fischer, I am here to protect you in the event that someone tries to access your mind through your dreams.
you're not safe here. They're coming for you.
strange weather, isn't it?
you feel that?
what's happening?
Cobb is drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream which is making his subconscious look for the dreamer.
for me. Quick, give me a kiss.
they're still looking at us. - Yeah, it's worth a shot.
feel that? You've actually been trained for this, Mr. Fischer.
pay attention to the strangeness of the weather, the shifting gravity.
none of this is real. You're in a dream.
now, the easiest for you to test yourself...
is to try to remember how you arrived at this hotel. Can you do that?
see, I don't, I...
breath, breath. Remember your training.
accept the fact that you're in a dream and I'm here to protect you.
go on.
you're not real? - No, no.
I'm a projection of your subconscious.
I was sent here to protect you in the event that extractors try to pull you into a dream.
and I believe that's what's going on right now, Mr. Fischer.
Yeah. Okay. Okay.
stay there.
Jesus Christ! What are you doing?
these men were sent here to abduct you, alright.
if you want my help, you have to remain calm.
I need you to work with me, Mr. Fischer.
if this is a dream, I should just kill myself to wake up, right?
I wouldn't do that if I were you, Mr. Fischer.
I believe they have you sedated and if you pull that trigger, you may not wake up.
you may go into a further dream state. Now, you know what I'm talking about.
you remember the training.
remember what I said to you. Give me the gun.
this room should be directly below 528?
Yeah.
think, Mr. Fischer, think what do you remember from before this dream?
there was...there was a lot of gunfires. And there's...rain.
uncle Peter. Oh my God, we've been kidnapped.
where were they holding you?
they had us in the back of a van. - That explains the gravity shifts.
you're in the back of a van right now. Keep going.
it had something to do with... something to do with a safe?
God, why is it so hard to remember?
it's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up.
listen, it takes years of practice.
you and Browning has been pulled into this dream...
because they're trying to steal something from your mind.
I need you to focus and try and remember what that is.
what is it, Mr. Fischer? Think!
a combination.
they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
they're trying to extract the number from your subconscious.
it can represent anything. We're in a hotel right now.
we should try hotel rooms. What was the number, Mr. Fischer?
try and remember for me. This is very important.
five.
five, two... It was something. it was a long number.
that's good enough. We could start there.
fifth floor. - Yup.
so do you use a timer? - No, I have to judge it for myself.
while you're all asleep in 528, I'll wait for Yusuf's kick.
well, how will you know? - His music warns me.
and then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge, that should be unmistakable.
so we get a nice, synchronized kick.
if it's too soon, we won't get pulled out.
if it's too late... I won't be able to drop us.
why not?
cause of the van, that will be in free fall. Can't drop you without gravity.
right.
you're with me. Go on.
Mr. Charles - Do you know what that is, Mr. Fischer?
Yeah, I think so, yeah. - They were trying to put you under.
I'm already under. - Under again.
what do you mean? A dream within a dream?
Hey. I see you've changed.
I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. I've mistaken you for a friend.
good looking fella, I'm sure.
that's Fischer's projection of Browning. Let's follow him and see how he behaves.
Why? - Because how he acts would tell us...
if Fischer is going to suspect his motives, the way we wanted to.
uncle Peter. - You said you were kidnapped together?
well, not exactly. They already had him. They were torturing him.
and you saw them torture him?
the kidnappers are working for you? - Robert.
you're trying to get that safe open? So you get the alternate will?
Fischer-Morrow has been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it.
I'm not gonna throw away my inheritance. Why would I?
I couldn't let you rise to your father's last taunt.
what taunt? - The will, Robert, that will.
that's his last insult.
a challenge for you to build something for yourself...
by telling you you're not worthy of his accomplishments.
what, that he was disappointed, hmm?
I'm sorry.
but...he's wrong.
you can build a better company than he ever did.
Mr. Fischer? He's lying!
how do you know? - Trust me, it's what I do.
he's hiding something and we need to find out what that is.
I need you to do the same thing to him that he was going to do to you.
we'll enter his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
alright.
he's out.
wait, whose subconscious are we going into exactly?
we're going into Fischer's.
but I told him it was Browning's so he can be a part of our team.
he's gonna help us break into his own subconscious.
that's right.
security's gonna run you down, huh.
and I will lead them on a merry chase.
just be back here for the kick.
go to sleep, Mr. Eames.
are you good?
are you alright? - Yes, yes. I'm.I'm fine. I'm ready.
Cobb? Cobb? What's down there?
hopefully the truth we want Fischer to learn.
I mean, what's down there for you?
did you see that?
Eames, this is your dream.
I need you to draw the security away from the complex, you understand?
who will guide Fischer in? - Not me.
find all the route, everything could be compromised.
I designed the place. - No, you're with me.
I could do it.
alright, you'll reach on the route into the complex.
Fischer, you'll be going with him. - Alright.
what about you? - Keep this alive. I'll be listening in the whole time.
the windows on that upper floor are big enough for me...
to cover you from that south tower. You see it?
Yeah. You're not coming in? - In order to find out the truth...
about your father, you're gonna need to break into Browning's mind on your own.
come, Fischer!
sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
move!
go!
so they're shooting me!
I hope they're ready.
it's too soon.
Cobb, do you hear that?
first heard it about twenty minutes ago. I thought it was the wind up here.
Yeah, I hear it. It's music.
so what do we do? - Move fast.
Yusuf's ten seconds for the jump.
which gives Arthur three minutes.
Hey!
which gives us what? - Sixty minutes.
can they make that route in under an hour?
they still have to climb down to the middle terrace.
well then, they need a new route. A more direct route.
there must be access where we can cut through the maze, right?
Eames?
did Eames add any features?
I don't think I should tell you. If Mal finds out...
we don't have time for this. Did he add any?
he added an air duct system that can cut through the maze.
good. Explain it to them.
Saito? - Go ahead.
paradoxical.
what was that? - The kick.
Cobb, did we miss it? - Yeah, we missed it.
couldn't you instead just have dreamt of a goddamn beach?
we finish the job before the next kick.
what next kick? - When the van hits the water.
if wanna make a call, please hang up and try again.
if you need assistance...
how do I drop you without gravity?
Arthur has a couple of minutes, we have about twenty.
are you okay?
move out! To the base!
there's something wrong. They're heading your way like they know something.
just buy us some more time, alright? Come on!
on my way.
that's the antechamber, it's just stronger.
was it stronger if it have any windows?
no, I mean it wouldn't be very strong if it did.
let's hope Fischer likes what he finds in there.
are those projections part of his subconscious?
Yes.
are you destroying those parts of his mind?
no, no. They're just projections.
we're here.
you're clear but hurry. There's an entire army headed your way.
we're in.
there's someone else in there. - Fischer, it's a trap, get out!
come on. A little lower.
Cobb. No, she is not real! - How do you know that?
hello.
Eames! Eames! Get to the antechamber now!
what happened? - Mal killed Fischer.
I couldn't shoot her.
but there's no use in reviving him...
his mind's already trapped down there. It's all over.
so that's it? Then we failed?
we're done. I'm sorry.
well, it's not me who's gonna get back to my family, is it?
it's a shame, I really want to know what's gonna happen in there.
I swear we have this one. - Let's set the charges.
no, there's still another way.
we just have to follow Fischer down there.
we don't have time.
no, but there will be enough time down there.
and we will find him.
okay, as soon as Arthur's music kicks in just use the defibrillator to revive him.
we can give him his own kick down below.
look you get him in there.
as soon as the music ends, you blow up the hospital.
and we all ride the kick back up the layers.
that's worth a shot.
and Saito can hold the guards out while I set the charges.
saito, will never make it, will he?
Cobb, come on! We've got to try.
let's go!
look if we're not that fully kicked, I am gonna leave in vain.
she's right. She's right.
can I trust you to do what's gonna happen here?
I mean, Mal's gonna be down there.
I know where to find her. She'll have Fischer.
how do you know?
she wants me to come after her, she wants me back down there with her.
are you alright?
this is your world? - Was.
this is where she'll be.
come on.
Saito...
I need you...I need you to take care of Fischer while I go set some charges, okay?
no room for tourists on this jobs.
don't be silly.
you built all these? This is incredible.
we built for years.
we started in on the memories.
this is our neighbourhood. The place is from my past.
that was our first apartment and we moved to that building right there.
after Mal became pregnant, that became our home.
you reconstructed all of these from memory?
like I told you, we have lots of time.
what is that?
it's the house Mal grew up with.
will she be in there? - No.
we both wanted to live in a house but we love this type of building.
in the real world, we'd have to choose, but not here.
how are you gonna bring Fischer back?
I'm gonna have to come up with some kind of a kick.
what?
the improvised.
listen, there's something you should know about me. About inception.
an idea is like a virus. Resilient.
highly contagious.
the smallest seed of an idea can grow.
it can grown to define or destroy you.
the smallest idea such as: "Your world is not real."
simple. little thought that changes everything.
so certain of your world. Of what's real?
do you think he is?
why do you think he's as lost as I was?
I know it's real, Mal.
no creeping doubts?
not feeling persecuted, Dom?
chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces?
the way the projections persecute the dreamer?
admit it.
you don't believe in one reality anymore.
so choose. Choose to be here.
choose me.
you know what I have to do, I have to get back to our children...
because you left them.
because you left us. - You're wrong.
not at all. - You're confused.
our children are here.
and you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?
Yes, but I want to see them up above, Mal.
up above?
listen to yourself. These are our children. Watch.
James? Phillipa?
don't do this, Mal, please. Those aren't my children.
you keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it.
no, I know it. - What if you're wrong?
what if I'm what's real?
you keep telling yourself what you know. But what do you believe? What do you feel?
guilt.
I feel guilt, Mal.
and no matter what I do, no matter how hopeless I am...
no matter how confused... that guilt is always there.
reminding me of the truth.
the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me.
you planted the idea in my mind?
what is she talking about?
the reason I knew inception was possible was because I did it to her first.
I did it to my own wife. - Why?
we were lost in here.
I knew we needed to escape but she wouldn't accept it.
she had locked something away, something...something deep inside.
the truth that she had once known but she chose to forget.
she couldn't break free.
so I decided to search for it.
going deep into the recess of her mind and found that secret place.
I broke in and I planted an idea.
a simple idea that I knew would change everything.
that her world wasn't real.
that death was the only escape.
you're waiting for a train.
a train that will take you far away...
you know where you hope this train will take you.
but you can't know for sure!
and it doesn't matter!
now tell me why! - Because we'll be together.
and I never knew that... that idea would grow in her mind like a cancer...
that even after she woke.
... that even after yo came back to reality that you keep to believe your world wasn't real.
that death was the only escape.
Mal, no! Jesus!
you're infecting my mind. - I was trying to save you.
you betrayed me but you can make amends.
you can still keep your promise.
we can still be together right here. In the world we built together.
Cobb, we need to get Fischer.
you can't have him.
if I stay here, will you let him go?
what are you talking about?
Fischer's on the porch.
go check if he's alive, Ariadne. - Cobb, you can't do this.
go check if he's alive, right now! Do it.
he's here and it's time but you have to come now!
I'm not. Saito's dead by now that means...
he's down here somewhere. That means I have to find him.
I can't stay with her anymore because she doesn't exist.
I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
I wish...
I wish more than anything, but...
...I can't imagine you with all your complexity.
all your perfection. All your imperfection.
are you alright?
look at you.
you're just a shade. You're just a shade of my real wife.
and you are the best that I could do, but...
...I'm sorry, you're just not good enough.
this will feel real?
what are you doing? - Improvise.
no, no, no!
get in there, now! Go, go, go!
disappointed...
disappointed...
I know, Dad.
I know you were disappointed. I couldn't be you.
no, no, no!...
I was disappointed that you tried.
come on, come on, come on!
dad?
that's the kick, Ariadne! You have to go now!
don't lose yourself! Find Saito and bring him back!
I will!
do you remember when you asked me to marry you?
Yes.
you said you dreamt that we'll grow old together.
but we did.
we did, you don't remember?
I'd miss you, more than I can bear, but...
... we had our time together.
and I have to let you go.
I have to let you go.
I'm sorry, Robert.
you know, the Will means that dad wanted me to be my own man.
not just to live for him.
that's what I'm gonna do, Uncle Peter.
what happened?
Cobb stayed. - With Mal?
no, to find Saito.
he'll be lost.
no, he'll be alright.
I'm waiting for someone.
someone from a half-remembered dream.
Cobb? Impossible.
we were young men together.
I'm an old man...
filled with regret.
waiting to die alone, huh.
I've come back for you... To remind you of something.
something you once knew.
that this world is not real.
to convince me to honor our arrangement?
to take a leap of faith, yes.
come back, so we can be young man together again.
come back with me. Come back.
hot towel, sir?
we'll landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes.
do you need immigration forms?
thank you.
hot towel, sir? - Oh no.
do you need immigration forms?
welcome home, Mr. Cobb. - Thank you, sir.
welcome home. This way.
James? Phillipa?
look who's here!
hey kids, how are you?
look what I built, Daddy!
what are you doing there? - I built a house made of rocks!
out of rocks? - Come, I want you to see it.
can you make me one?
come on, Daddy!
Attaboy! Keep him busy!
one. Jesus.
two. You got it.
three. He ain't getting up!
out!
come here, Jimmy.
get that sleeping beauty out of here!
that's ten in a row, Jimmy! Ten!
by a knockout, at one minute 46 seconds in the second round...
tonight's light heavyweight winner...
from the great state of New Jersey...
you're gonna be the next champ, Jimmy!
Hey, how you doing?
just give them a few. Leave them wanting.
you want to sign my name for me, too?
at least then they can read it.
you gave him a cold meat party.
sign this for me, Mr. Braddock.
you've been getting stronger with every fight.
I've been seeing it.
you may favor the right, sure, but you got no stage fright or nerves.
and you have never been knocked out.
you're in line. That's all I'm saying, Jimmy.
you're gonna get your shot.
all right, let me see what we got here.
$886 for Jeanette...
$772 for Lou and Whitey...
$1, 000 for the ring fees, my $2, 658 and your $3, 544...
makes $8, 860. Stick that in your mattress, Irishman.
when we get there, you gonna come in and see the kids?
it's been a while. Come on. They miss their Uncle Joey.
Yeah, that's very sweet. You still married to the same girl?
I was this morning.
well, congratulations. Maybe I'll take a rain check.
and would you tell her...
will you tell her I undercharged on the gym fees...
and no load on the towel? Would you do that for me, please?
I will be sure to point it out. I appreciate it.
you stop up at the corner here somewhere, Frank.
home to Jersey for Mr. Adventure over here.
all right, see you, Frank.
I could kill you!
I like the sound of that.
Yeah, I like the sound of that a lot.
Jimmy. Yeah?
my sister.
daddy, did we win?
Yeah, we won.
how are you, Alice?
good. That's wonderful, Jimmy.
Hey, Howard.
thank you.
so tell me about him.
was he a real slugger?
you know, you could come and watch.
no. You get hit...
every time, it feels like I'm getting hit, too.
and I'm not half as tough as you are.
so, tell me about the girls.
girls?
I was at the Garden, it was a fight night...
come on. There was one.
there must've been one. No.
blond? Brunette.
[Exclaiming]
tall?
like a gazelle.
I don't know how it is she breathed up there.
Mr. Braddock!
you're so strong!
and your hands, they're so big.
you're so powerful!
Jimmy, I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
[Imitating announcer] Introducing...
two-time state Golden Gloves title holder...
in both the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions...
21-0, with 16 wins coming by way of knockout...
the Bulldog of Bergen, the pride of New Jersey...
and the hope of the Irish...
as the future champion of the world...
ma, you woke me up.
[Mae whispering] Well, you kicked the covers off, honey.
now you go back to sleep, all right?
good night, Mom.
good night, sweetheart.
I can't find my socks. [Shushing]
Jim! I'm sorry.
mama?
great. I'm sorry, baby.
I washed them last night. Took them right off your feet.
don't you remember? No.
well, you were out like a light.
how do I keep them this warm?
mama, I want to eat, too.
mommy will get you some, honey.
Hey, Rosy-Rosy. Good morning, good morning.
got a notice yesterday. Gas and electric.
come on.
Okey-okey, there we go. I'll get the milk.
well, I think there's some left over.
Yep.
you know, I got that fight tonight at the armory.
Yeah, one guy, Abe Feldman.
that's $50, win or lose.
that's good.
if I beat him, maybe I can get my purses back up to $75.
that would be great.
rosy, use your fork, please.
who needs a cow, huh?
mama, I want some more.
I'm sorry, sweetheart. We need to save some for the boys.
here you go.
you know, Mae, I dreamed last night...
that I was having dinner at The Ritz.
with Mickey Rooney and George Raft.
really! Yeah.
and I dreamed I had a steak. A thick, juicy steak.
like this, Rosy.
and then I had a mountain of mashed potatoes...
and I went back for ice cream three times.
I'm stuffed.
I'm absolutely full. I cannot eat another thing.
want to give me a hand?
boys, hurry up. Don't dawdle.
let's try and sleep a little more.
I need nine men and only nine.
seven. Eight. Nine. That's it!
all right, let's get a move on!
go on, get going! Got a lot of work today!
Hey, Dad. Hey.
no shifts today, Dad? What're you doing, son?
I'm being good. I'm being quiet. I'm being 'hayve.
great.
daddy!
Hey, Rosy-cheeks. How you doing?
daddy, Jay stole!
what? Jay stole.
what's all this about? See? It's a salami.
young lady, your brother's in enough trouble...
without you telling on him. You understand?
it's from the butcher's.
and he won't say a word about it, will you, Jay?
will you, Jay?
okay, pick it up. Let's go.
do not test me, boy. Right now.
Howard, stay here.
okay, let's go! Come on, give me a hand here!
great, then you don't get paid!
Bye.
don't forget to pick it up easy!
Marty Johnson had to go away to Delaware to live with his uncle.
Why?
his parents didn't have enough money for them to eat.
Yeah, well, things ain't easy at the moment, Jay, you're right.
but there's a lot of people worse off than what we are.
and just 'cause things ain't easy...
that don't give you the excuse to take what's not yours, does it?
that's stealing, right? And we don't steal.
no matter what happens, we don't steal.
not ever. You got me?
are you giving me your word? Yes.
go on. I promise.
and I promise you...
we will never send you away.
it's okay, kid.
you got a little scared. I understand.
it's okay.
Jim, he's a very slow guy.
just plants himself there.
so you just keep him steady.
keep him trapped in the middle. Keep dancing around him, okay?
you know what to do. You know this type.
that guy's a bum.
two bits will get a guy a seat.
and that guy gets to watch you bleed and call you a bum.
and I know I gotta take it from him, 'cause he's a paying customer.
I see.
well, well, well.
pardon me, miss. Allow me to restate my position.
Mr. Abraham Feldman is a novice fighter...
whose ass you should gently kick...
until it is humped up between his shoulder blades.
that is, if it doesn't offend your overly sensitive nature.
God knows.
now, you see, that break's still a few weeks away.
I know. Yeah.
and you were gonna tell me about this when?
it's gonna be fine. It's not fine. No, it's not.
what the hell? You don't tell me?
what the hell kinda crap is that? I owe everybody money, Joe.
I can't get any shifts.
we ain't got any cash.
I got it.
screw them. I'll tape it double.
Thanks.
keep up. Stay up.
keep moving. Keep your legs moving.
and here comes Braddock with his long-time manager, Joe Gould.
you're washed up, Braddock.
and now for our main event.
Hey, which one's us, pal?
Jersey veteran James J. Braddock...
is up against Hymie Caplin's latest charge...
young Abe Feldman from Schenectady, New York.
six rounder.
some might recall that Braddock was once...
a light heavyweight title challenger.
his golden-boy peak ended when Tommy Loughran handled Jim over 15 rounds back in '29.
since then, the oft-injured Braddock...
has shown only a glimmer of his early promise.
and the losses have started to pile up.
but Braddock continues to battle.
and here comes the popular Abe Feldman.
Feldman looks to be the real thing...
and showed some real moxie in his recent win over Hans Birkie.
Hey, who whipped Latzo?
I did. Goddamn right.
who KO'ed Slattery in the ninth...
when everybody said he didn't have a rainmaker's chance in hell?
that'd have to be me, too. Right.
and we're supposed to pucker our assholes over this Abe Feldman?
the guy couldn't break wind. No.
Hey, Jimmy.
anyplace else you'd rather be?
no. Good.
now, what are you gonna do about it?
here we are halfway through the fifth [men screaming] And it's more of the same.
the boys clinch again.
break it up.
he's crushing my guy. Get him off!
[Crowd booing] Break!
the boo-birds have started flying here.
they want action from these fighters.
Feldman sticks a left in Braddock's face.
Braddock's right hand is his best and only weapon.
he'll show the left, but it lacks snap and Feldman knows it.
come on, give these yokels a shot in the ass!
Feldman ducks a haymaker but fails to follow up.
and another big right by Braddock.
now, there's the Braddock we all recall.
but it's one at a time. It may not be enough.
come on!
the referee pulls the boys apart.
and there's the bell to end the fifth.
easy now. Easy.
I saw that. You bust it again?
I'm calling it, Jim.
you gonna use the left? Okay, good.
you get in there but you don't let him crowd you.
you work his belly, you hammer his belly with the left.
last round. Come on, you got to show me something.
give me a good one. You're giving me an ulcer, Harry!
shut up.
work his belly with the left. You got it?
give him the flapdoodle with the right because he don't know.
right? 'Cause he's kind of stupid.
okay? Last round.
last round! Go get him!
the left!
damn it, I wish he could find his goddamn left.
that's it! Change it up!
southpaw, that's it!
Feldman prancing around, looking for an opening...
but still few clean punches by the fighters.
Braddock still pawing away with the left.
another ineffectual left from Feldman.
Braddock can hardly lift his arms. He's slow on his feet.
at least Gould in his corner is still throwing punches...
trying to urge his man on.
[Yelling] Go home!
go home, Braddock!
no holding, Braddock!
Cavanaugh's working harder than the fighters.
dry up!
another clinch.
it's as if 80 tough fights have finally jumped on Braddock's back.
you're a bum!
that's it!
Cavanaugh pulls them apart, and he's called the fight.
he's called the fight.
it's a "no contest.
and the popcorn and the peanuts are raining down.
and I'm afraid to say that's all these fighters deserve...
for the show they put on tonight.
I'm telling you, it's sad to see a fighter that was once the caliber of James Braddock reduced to this.
it's all right, Jimmy.
an embarrassment, that's what it was.
an embarrassment!
where the hell's the purse?
you wouldn't have to be asking that...
if you gave a shit about your fighter.
okay. He's fighting hurt.
maybe you got a bunch of fat and happy fighters at home can afford to rest a month between bouts. I don't know. Lucky you!
Christ, he hardly gets a punch in anymore!
fights being stopped by referees? He's pathetic!
fights like that keep people away.
we're revoking his license, Joe.
whatever Braddock was gonna do in boxing, I guess he's done it.
wait a minute. That's all.
[Whispering] Oh, boy.
Mr. Johnston!
what's going on?
you didn't tell him? Yeah, of course I told him.
he wanted to hear it from you.
come on, Mr. Johnston, no contest?
I broke my hand. Okay? It's legit.
you don't see me crying about it.
I don't see what you got to complain about.
I still went out there, I still put on a show. I did what I could do.
you know, we did that boondock circuit for you...
me and Joe. Remember?
I didn't quit on you. And I didn't quit tonight.
I didn't always lose.
I won't always lose again.
I can still fight. Go home.
I can still fight. Go home to Mae and the kids, Jim.
go home? Go home with what?
go home with what? A broken hand from Mount Vernon?
Mr. Johnston!
baby?
what happened?
I didn't get the dough.
they didn't pay up.
they called it a "no contest," said the fight was an embarrassment.
they decommissioned me.
Jimmy, what happened to your hand?
it's broke again in three places.
they said I'm through, Mae.
they said I can't be a boxer no more.
mercy.
okay.
Jimmy, if you can't work...
we're not gonna be able to pay the electric, or the heat.
and we're out of credit at the grocery.
so I think we need to pack the kids.
they could stay at my sister's for a little while...
and I'll take in more sewing.
that way we could make two, three breadlines a day.
I'll get doubles, triples, whatever I can find.
Jimmy, you can't work. Mae, I can still work.
Jimmy, you can't work. Your hand's broken.
they see me lugging this around, you're right, they won't pick me.
not down the docks, not anywhere.
so we're gonna cover it up...
with the shoe polish.
okay?
I'm sorry. No.
no.
no.
I need five and only five!
come on, Jake!
five. That's it!
what the hell happened to your face?
I got in a fight. Yeah?
What'd you go do that for?
that's a good question.
I used to follow a pretty good fighter with that name.
and there's some other guy going around using that name now.
can't fight for shit.
gambling man will lose a lot of money on him. Twice.
that hand ain't gonna work.
you can't slow me down. I need this job.
I need the job, too.
what's wrong with the goddamn hand?
you see us falling behind, Jake?
he's all right.
appreciate it.
I'll get a cold beer.
just a water for me, Quincy.
all I got today are big spenders.
beer for him, too. I'm buying.
don't hurt my feelings.
it's been a while, but... You don't have to twist my arm.
Yeah, I used to be a broker. Still lost it all in '29.
Yeah, me, too.
I had just about everything I ever earned in stocks.
even had a little taxi company.
I mean, who loses their dough on cabs in New York City, right?
well, I thought that one was gold for the grandkiddies.
you know, there's people living in shacks in Central Park.
call it the Hooverville.
this government's dropped us flat.
we need to organize, you know? Unionize. Fight back.
fight? Fight what?
bad luck? Greed? Drought?
no point punching things you can't see.
no, we'll work a way through this.
FDR, he's gonna handle it. Screw FDR.
FDR, Hoover, they're all the same.
you know, I come home one day. I stand in my living room.
and between the mortgage and the market and the goddamn lawyer...
that was supposed to be working for me...
it stopped being mine.
it all stopped being mine.
FDR ain't given me my house back yet.
mama, why can't I go to school?
is it because I'm a girl?
maybe. Hadn't thought of that.
who's that man at our house?
excuse me!
can I help you?
I'm sorry, lady, you're past due.
[Panting] No, you can't.
you can't. There's kids.
if I don't, they let me go.
they already let two guys go. Please.
this apartment, it's what we got left that keeps us hanging on.
lady, I got kids, too.
$6. 74.
how much to turn it back on?
four months. $44. 12.
if I work 26 hours out of every 24, it still won't add up.
we ain't got nothing. Nothing left to sell.
all the guys you could've married, huh?
Yeah. What happened to those guys?
it's Howard.
since this afternoon.
bless us, O Lord...
and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty.
I'm all prayed out.
here's more firewood.
where are you going? I said where are you going?
go to hell, you no-good bastard!
go on, then! We don't need you!
all right. Help me, pick up some of that wood.
I got it, Mama. All right, let's go, sweetheart.
all right, honey.
nice and warm, huh?
baby?
baby?
look at Mommy.
sweetheart.
mommy?
what's wrong?
nothing, sweetheart.
mommy will be right back, okay?
Howard's fever was getting worse and then Rosy started to sneeze.
where are they, Mae? Jim, we can't even keep 'em warm.
where are the kids?
the boys will sleep on the sofa at my father's in Brooklyn.
and Rosy'll stay at my sister's.
Jimmy, we can't keep 'em!
you don't make decisions about our children without me.
what if they get really sick? We already owe Dr. McDonald...
if you send them away, then all this has been for nothing!
it's just until we get back... What else was it for?
if we can't stay together, that means we lost!
that means we've given up! I am not giving up!
I'm trying to protect our children. Mae, I promised him.
outside the butcher's.
I looked him in the eyes...
and I promised him with all of my heart...
I would never ever send him away.
you can't do this.
you weren't here.
you can't break my promise.
Jim, you didn't see. You weren't here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
what are you doing?
Jimmy! Where you going?
where you going, Jimmy?
that doesn't qualify you, sir. What else can you tell me?
the problem is my wife is losing all of her teeth.
I got a relief order for her.
the doctor says it's due to insufficient diet.
she's still nursing the baby on account of...
we can't afford milk for the family.
okay.
I never thought I'd see you here, Jim.
he jumped up...
kicked his stool out of the ring...
and he was just, he was furious.
I grabbed the mike...
the thing is, I can't afford to...
I can't afford to pay the heat.
I've had to farm out my kids.
you know, they keep cutting shifts down at the docks...
and you just don't get picked every day.
I sold everything I've got that anybody would buy.
I went on public assistance. I signed on at the relief office.
they gave me $19. I need another $18. 38...
so I can pay the bill and get the kids back.
you know me well enough to know if I had anywhere else to go...
I wouldn't be here.
if you could help me through this time, I sure would be grateful.
sure, Jim. Sure.
good luck.
Hey, Jimmy.
here you go, Jim.
good luck, Jim.
I'm sorry, Joe, I didn't... I'm sorry.
what in the hell do you have to be sorry about?
Jesus Christ, Jimmy.
how short are you?
about $1. 50.
okay.
we're home! Hooray, we're home!
we're glad to be home!
good.
okay. All right.
Howard, don't jump on the bed. Sorry, Mama.
read to me, Jay.
on his way up and down the stairs...
do you like being home? I like being home, too.
my little doll.
make a wish, kids.
blow!
Hey, Howard, come on. They're gonna cut the cake up.
you wanna line up, huh?
you looking forward to some chocolate cake?
I liked it better when we had our own.
I can understand that.
Hiya, Howard. Hi.
Hey, your dad ever tell you that I used to spar with him?
you hit the Father? As often as I possibly could.
he was kinda tricky, though. Hard to catch.
go and get some cake. Go on.
missed you at mass, Jimmy.
I can get an extra shift on a Sunday, you know?
don't you walk away from me! James.
Mike, you hear me?
excuse me.
every day, "fix the world." How about fixing your family?
what kind of father are you?
too proud to cross the street because she can't have her own cake?
and now you're drunk at church, for Christ's sake.
that a joke, Sara? Making a joke? I'm just saying it's enough!
guys, where's the ref? Why don't you stay out of this?
it's between man and wife. How do you even call yourself that?
What'd you say to me? Come on.
get your hands off me!
you've had a couple drinks. It's Sunday.
no harm in that. Day of rest. All washed up. Can't get a fight.
what, you want to fight me?
Mike, you don't have to do this.
I ain't got no beef with you.
come on! Can't make it in the ring, huh?
come on, Braddock, I'll take your head off!
Jim, no! Mike, you okay, baby?
[Panting] Why don't you get off me?
go to hell! The both of you!
Jesus, Jim, he wasn't gonna hit me.
Mike, wait!
now, what it's all about is rotating your body behind your fist.
bang. That's right. Right in the kisser, yeah.
there you go.
good girl. You got a better jab than your dad.
boy, you are a brave man. Not really. Mae's at the store.
that's a good one, kiddo!
you want to go play with the other kids while I talk to Uncle Joe?
Joe Gould, still looking dapper, I see.
certainly. Gotta keep up appearances, right?
good to see you, Jimmy. Nice to see you, Joe.
nice day, huh?
Yeah.
you drove all the way out here to talk about the weather?
maybe I was in the neighborhood. Did you ever think of that?
little fresh air.
Joe, this is Jersey.
Yeah. Good point.
I got you a fight.
go to hell. Come on. You want it, don't you?
what, we gonna bring this up with the Boxing Commission, or not?
Yes, and they'll sanction it. This one fight, and one fight only.
it's not a comeback, right? It's just one fight.
Why? 'Cause of who you're fighting.
how much?
just once, ask me who it is you're fighting.
how much? $250.
you're on at the big show at the Garden, tomorrow night.
you fight Corn Griffin, Jimmy.
number two heavyweight contender in the world.
prelim before the championship bout.
you know, Joe, this ain't funny. No, it's not.
and it ain't no favor, either.
Griffin's opponent got cut, and he couldn't fight.
so they had to find somebody they could throw in at a day's notice.
nobody legit would...
nobody would take a fight with Griffin without training.
so I told them use the angle Griffin's gonna knock out a guy...
never been knocked out.
you're meat, Jimmy.
are you on the level, Joe?
come on. Always.
for $250, I would fight your wife.
now you're dreaming.
and your grandmother. At the same time.
teeth in or teeth out? Take them out.
then you're dead. You're down, you're gone.
no chance. $250?
250 bananas. Come here.
get your programs here!
programs here! 25 cents!
I mean, for Christ's sake, 100 and something fights...
you never been knocked out.
who the hell goes and sells his gear?
80 fights as a pro, 50 as an amateur.
how soon they forget! I'm so sorry.
borrowed gear, borrowed robe. Knock yourself out.
I might as well get an Aooga horn and chase him around the ring.
that's good. You been drinking?
are you trying to hurt my feelings?
you're just too loose. You're spooking me. Sharpen up.
come on, Joe, we both know what this is, right?
I get to put a little more distance between my kids and the street...
and I get to say good-bye at the Garden.
full house, night of a big fight.
thank you very much.
right. Come on, hurry up.
let's get the lead out of here.
what the hell was that?
they ran out of soup on the line this morning.
ran out of soup on the line this morning.
how the hell are you supposed to fight on an empty stomach?
good evening.
welcome to tonight's broadcast of the Primo Carnera/Max Baer fight for the heavyweight championship of the world!
hash is all they had, okay? Eat, quick.
you got a spoon? For Christ's sake, it's not there?
come on, we gotta go anyway. One bite, Joe.
I'll eat it with my fingers. Whoa, hey!
I don't have time to re-tape you.
just sit tight, and I'll find you a spoon.
for Christ's sake.
is that a ghost I'm seeing? An apparition?
or is that James J. Braddock, the Bulldog of Bergen?
how you feeling, Jimmy? How's that right hand?
Braddock, you're up!
sporty Lewis, how you doing? How you doing?
july 18, 1929.
new York Herald.
proving he was too young and too green...
and rushed to the top...
Loughran wiped the ring with the Bulldog's career.
a sad and somber funeral...
with the body still breathing.
I don't fight the fights, Jimmy, I just write about them, see?
sporty, save the crap for the customers.
who's Jim Braddock?
go get your pencil out, kid. I got your lead line for you.
go ahead, I'm not kidding, write this down.
the walk from the locker room to the ring...
was the only time tonight old Jim Braddock...
looking good, Jimmy!
...was seen on his feet." You got that?
before tonight's championship battle, we'll bring you...
a special bout featuring Charlie Harvey's soldier boy...
corn Griffin.
Griffin is the fella that ran rings...
around the champion Carnera in training.
and who's his opponent?
looks like they dug old Jim Braddock out of retirement...
at least for one more fight.
Hey, Mike! Griffin is up in the ring now.
Braddock? Isn't that your buddy? Look at the size of him!
in this corner...
the sensational heavyweight slugger...
from Fort Benning, Georgia...
who is punching a path to the top of the division.
his opponent.; the popular battler...
who has never been KO'ed in more than 80 professional bouts...
Quincy, beer. We got a fight!
...the power-punching veteran...
from North Bergen, New Jersey...
the skinny from the reporters at ringside is that Braddock won't last two rounds.
Griffin is a five-to-one favorite to do just that.
but Joe Gould claims Braddock's right hand is fine.
[Bell rings] Jimmy will need two good hands tonight.
Griffin storms out of his corner!
things are uptempo right away.
come on, Braddock, make a fight of it!
get out of it! Get out, Jimmy!
Braddock takes a left to the body and a hard right to the head!
Braddock's giving ground now.
a hard right!
pins him in the neutral corner.
get outta there, Jim! Get out!
Griffin's all over him!
Braddock taking hard jabs.
and Braddock is down.
shut up! I wanna hear this! Shut up!
Jim? You're fine. Stay down.
one. Two. Stay down! What's the hurry?
three. Four. Hey! Listen.
I liked the left. Try two lefts. Five.
give him two lefts! Six.
pop, pop! Double it up. Seven.
how 'bout it? Up, up. Eight.
what the hell are you doing? Let's go.
Yeah, come on, Jimmy! On your feet, come on!
the referee waving Griffin in.
move in on that.
nice move!
bring him in!
snaps a stiff jab! Another!
welcome to New York.
beautiful!
that's more like it! Let me see that cut.
you look great!
it sure as hell beats working on the docks!
say, the two jabs look sensational! They look sweet!
now, he's loading up on you. You see that?
he opens up after you jab him. You gotta come in there with a right.
real quick.
but you gotta stop some of those left hands.
you see any getting past my head?
keep moving!
Griffin still winging big shots.
he wants to be the first to stop Braddock.
Braddock gets in another big right hand!
snapped Griffin's head back with that one.
come on!
Griffin loading up.
move out! Give him the slip, Jimmy!
another big flurry by Griffin!
Braddock hanging tough but, folks, he is taking a beating!
that's two rounds more than I thought he was gonna go.
he's a half a step behind you. Do you feel it?
stick with it.
busy, busy.
six minutes of fury so far.
Braddock has the look of a man trying to hold back an avalanche.
Griffin hits him with a left.
and Braddock is stepping in post holes.
keep him in front of you!
lure him in, Jim.
Jimmy's finally moving his head.
pick your spot!
and Griffin is down!
where the hell have you been, Jimmy Braddock?
he's up at three.
the referee wipes his gloves.
that's it! No daylight!
take it to him!
another big right by Braddock!
finish him, Jimmy!
knock him back to the goddamn Ozarks!
Griffin is ready to go!
be careful.
get back.
get back there. Get back in your corner.
this fight is over! This is incredible!
[Bell ringing] Corn Griffin, the number two contender in the world has just been knocked out by Jim Braddock in the third round!
what an upset!
you son of a bitch!
it's pandemonium here in the Garden!
that's it, man, he did it! I don't believe it!
you beautiful bastard!
settle down, for Christ's sake!
Jesus H. Christ!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Mary Magdalene...
all the saints and martyrs and Jesus!
did I say "Jesus"?
where the hell did that come from?
I don't know. When my hand was broke...
I had to work down on the docks and I had to use my left.
so, what? No, that and luck.
luck? Sheer dumb-ass Irish luck.
don't give me that luck-of-the-lrish crap. No, sir.
lucky? That's something you ain't been in a long time, brother.
everybody's due.
due or not, I'll take it. You had the left.
the left. But you were bouncy.
you were bouncing.
unbelievable. Sliding, slipping. You were like a cat.
I did that on hash.
imagine what I would've done to him if I'd had a couple of steaks.
that was one hell of a good-bye.
here you go, fellas! Have at him!
Jesus Christ!
murder him, Maxie!
Primo!
this is fighting?
why doesn't he just hit him with a goddamn chair?
Griffin was supposed to fight Baer next.
he should kiss your ass for saving him from that thing.
throw him down, Maxie!
give it to him, Maxie!
ladies and gentlemen...
the new heavyweight champion of the world...
come on! He's home.
I won.
Hooray, he won! I knew you'd win!
he won, he won, he won!
get the silverware.
so was it like you said? Or are they letting you back in?
no, baby. It was just one fight.
all right, I need seven men, and seven only!
Thanks.
listened in last night. Was that really you?
Yeah.
didn't think I'd be seeing you back here.
it came up at the last minute, you know?
it was a one-fight deal. The purse was $250.
my end of that was a little less than half. It was, like, $123.
we owed $118. Left me with $5.
makes you a rich man, huh? Around here.
good fight. Thanks.
dock seven. Seven.
Hey, Jim. Hey, Mike.
good fight. Thanks.
I wouldn't have hit Sara. I know, Mike.
I couldn't live with myself if I'd have hit her.
just get so angry with all this shit.
you know, if you were gonna win, you could've told me.
if I knew I was gonna win, I would've bet on myself.
why can't you ever listen to me? I don't know.
...to determine whether the strikers were willing to submit to an arbitration situation.
tension pervaded the New York waterfront yesterday.
why don't you go play with the boys, sweetheart?
be careful.
Hey, Rosy. Hi, Daddy!
you know, Joe Gould was just here.
Yeah, I saw. You did?
he thinks the Commission might be willing to reverse their ruling.
he thinks he can get me another fight.
he wants me to stop working and get back in shape.
I thought it was just the one fight.
well, yeah.
he fronted us $175 so I can train.
you know what that is right there?
that's a second chance.
that's what that is.
it's not that I'm not grateful or proud, honey. I'm so proud of you.
but we got off easy when you broke that hand.
we're back to even now.
right. And nine months from now, we're back in the same boat.
baby, please.
we just don't have anything left to risk.
there's still some juice in these legs, and I can still take a few.
baby, please.
just let me take them in the ring.
at least I know who's hitting me.
I'm gonna go and tell the kids.
Jay! Guess what. What?
I got another fight! Who with?
I don't know, but he's going down. Hey, Howard.
Jesus.
Joe, open the door.
Joe! Open the damn door!
don't hide in your fancy apartment. I want to talk to you.
you are not gonna make my husband your punching bag all over again.
we are just getting by, and you're taking him from his work...
like some bloodsucking little leech!
and I will not let you get him hurt again like that...
do you hear me? I will not let you!
guess you better come in.
how is it?
too sweet per usual.
Really? Go figure.
yours? Nice, thanks.
sorry about that.
you just don't want folks to see you down is all.
I didn't know. I mean, I thought that...
Yeah, no. That's the idea. Always keep your hands up.
sold the last of it two days ago.
so Jimmy could train.
Why?
sometimes you have an instinct, Mae.
you see something in a fighter.
you don't even know if it's real, you're looking for it so bad.
can't have no hope at all.
but this is crazy.
I mean, you don't even know if you can get him a fight.
I'll get him a fight.
believe me, if it's the last thing I do, I'll get him a fight.
honey. Go get us some of those crackers, would you?
she looks good wearing the pants.
can you ever stop yours?
when he sets his mind to a thing?
I wish I could.
see, I never know who it's harder on...
them or us.
we have to wait for them to fix everything.
and every day...
they feel like they're failing us.
and really, it's just the world that's failed, you know?
this is a lovely apartment. Thank you.
now, what am I gonna go and do that for?
you saw the papers.
news had to print extra copies the day after Braddock's fight.
people are sentimental, you know. Some people are sentimental.
Yeah, so tell me why I care.
you're still sore over the way Braddock took down Griffin, fine.
I can understand that. It was a heartbreak for a lot of people.
Yes. But look.
you got guys fighting an elimination series...
over who gets a shot at Max Baer for the championship in June.
John Henry Lewis, he's your number two in line.
now, he already defeated Braddock once in Frisco, correct?
say you put Braddock back in the game against Lewis.
Lewis wins, you get your revenge on Braddock...
and your boy has gotten a topflight tune-up...
with full publicity before Lasky, and what happens?
you make more money.
now, say on the other hand, by some minute, infinitesimal chance...
God forbid, Braddock beats Lewis.
now you got a sentimental favorite go up...
and lose against Lasky, and what happens?
you'll make more money.
James, either way...
you're a richer man with Braddock back in the ring than if he's not.
come on, don't be foolish. We both know the name of this game.
and it sure as hell ain't "pugilism.
they ought to put your mouth in a circus.
what do you say?
don't chase him. Go around, cut him off.
time! James!
I got you a fight. Yeah?
you're gonna fight John Henry Lewis again.
Yeah!
Joey! I could kiss you!
no, please, not in front of the fellas.
isn't John Henry one of Johnston's boys?
you let me worry about that, please.
now I know why you won't kiss me. You're all puckered out already.
brother, you have no idea.
Lewis? Kicked our ass in Frisco.
Yeah. Hey, Mike. Who's "our ass" up there?
Joe Gould, Mike Wilson. Mike Wilson, Joe Gould.
Hi.
that guy ain't been beat in ten fights.
but you win on a long shot, and that's a great payday for me.
that's great. I'll keep that in mind, Mike!
you got more important things to think about. Come here.
now, I ain't gonna bullshit you, all right?
now, you win one, I can get you another.
win again and then things maybe start getting serious around here.
win.
look good.
leverage.
that's it, James!
be a bully, James! Aggression, that's it.
Thanks.
I know this isn't what you wanted...
but I can't win without you behind me.
I'm always behind you.
thank you, baby.
I got a great idea. You want to come along?
come on, just this one time. All right. Okay.
okay, I'll make that a rain check then.
Lewis, still moving well here in the fourth.
he dances in and out before Braddock can react.
don't let him set the pace, Jimmy!
there you go.
Braddock slides to his right, tries cutting down the ring.
John, get off the ropes. Move out of there.
Lewis spins his way off the ropes...
[Bell rings] And looks to resume control at the bell!
there we go. Suck it up. Deep breath.
deep breath, deep.
all right. That ain't bad. He's even faster than I remember.
Yeah. He's fast. Big deal. You're not so bad yourself.
what are you doing? You beat this guy easy last time.
he ain't the same guy. You got to use your speed.
keep that jab in his face and keep sliding to his right.
you see that. Keep him in front of you.
cut him off, all right?
and let go with the punches. Hit him! He ain't gonna like it.
I guarantee you, the more you hit this bastard...
the slower he's gonna get.
he's an old man. He's too slow. He can't keep up with you.
come on. Use that jab. How's that cut?
he's all right.
knock the legs out from under him.
trap him in the corner, and really work him.
do not fight this fight his way.
you make him fight this fight your way!
let's go. You got him.
a left to the body and a hard right to the head!
a left-right-left by Lewis. His dancing shoes are off.
it's a fight now, folks!
work his body, Jim!
Braddock punching well with both hands now.
toe to toe! No one giving an inch.
that left has some pop!
Jimmy's hoping those body shots will pay dividends.
keep him in there! Stay with him!
don't give him any room! No room!
get out of the corner.
Braddock pushing all the action now.
Lewis can't discourage him. Tremendous pressure from Jimmy.
Lewis is running out of real estate in this 24-foot ring.
jump on him!
and Lewis is down!
gotcha. Good boy.
get up!
one. There you go, get up!
two. Come on.
the referee wipes his gloves and Braddock steams back to ring center!
close it down.
another big right by Braddock!
Lewis is just a piece of meat as Braddock is carving him up!
Braddock is now dominating Lewis! Here comes Jimmy!
side to side! Side to side!
in the tenth, riding high after his dazzling victory...
over John Henry Lewis...
Jim Braddock has just hit a wall named Art Lasky.
he can't keep taking those body shots.
I know. He's cracked a couple of ribs for sure.
losing Diana was like losing a part of me.
I thought nothing could change the way we felt about each other.
I thought we were invincible.
someone once said, "If you want something very badly...
set it free.
if it comes back to you, it's yours forever.
if it doesn't,
it was never yours to begin with."
I knew one thing...
I was David's to begin with...and he was mine.
you light up my life
we met in high school.
david was a senior, and I was a freshman.
on Wednesdays after Glee Club...
he'd drive me and my best friend home from school.
I used to watch him in the rearview mirror.
I fell in love with his eyes.
when I was 19,
david proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.
our parents were against it.
they said we were too young, we really didn't know each other.
but David said that a life without risk is like no life at all.
so we eloped.
I graduated from architecture school... and got a job at a small firm.
Diana helped support us by selling real estate.
I spent all of my free time working on a design of my own.
it summed up everything about architecture that mattered to me.
it was my dream house.
D?
have I ever told you I love you?
no.
I do. Still?
always.
we had our differences.
he used to take his clothes off and leave them on the floor.
it made me crazy.
what do you think this is?
leaving your shoes on the table?
what is the problem? - I don't need to do your laundry!
honey, I'll pick it up. You don't have to get violent.
what about this? Peanut butter sandwich?
put that down! That is serious. You're gonna hurt somebody.
hurt somebody, huh? - You're out of your mind.
okay, now, fine.
goddamn it!
come on. Let's just relax.
did I hurt you?
I'm sorry.
Really? - Yeah. You were kidding?
d, your pants are on fire.
you have no idea.
we never had much money, so for entertainment...
david would show me architecture that moved him.
but sometimes I'd have to ask...
why are we looking at a stupid car wash?
and he'd just say, "No, not stupid.
don't just use your eyes.
he made me look at things differently.
David, this is a steal. Nobody even knows about it yet.
it's beautiful. - You could build a house here.
make a name for yourself.
the house will be brilliant because it will be a David Murphy house.
I found an incredible property in Santa Monica by the ocean.
it was the perfect site for David's house.
how are we supposed to do it? - Borrow money, like everybody else.
I'm telling you, these leverage- stockbroker-buyout guys...
you should see the junk they buy.
they would go crazy for a house of yours.
it was brilliant, even though I didn't understand a word of it.
we had to tighten our belts for the loan payments...
but it was our future, and I got to build my house.
then the recession hit.
the real estate market dried up...
and I hadly closed a sale in six months.
construction fell to its lowest point in years.
people were being laid off everywhere, and I was one of them.
I feel really bad about this.
I don't understand. What happened?
the bank has called in the demand note.
can they do that?
you don't have any income right now...
so they could attach your assets.
what assets?
your house.
gotta keep up those payments.
I'm sorry.
David, I'm scared.
we don't have any money.
what are we gonna do?
I'll wait tables or drive a cab or something.
I'll take care of you.
make it go away.
I was desperate. We stood to lose everything...
the house I'd been building, even our own home.
I swallowed my pride and borrowed $5, 000 from my father.
it wasn't enough.
we needed $50, 000.
money...
D.- What?
get up. Get dressed. - What's the matter? - I got an idea. Come on.
what time is it? - Chop, chop.
Hi! How you doing? Okay! Cigars. Cigarettes.
lighted yo-yos.
Oh, yeah! - Oh, my God!
Oh, honey. That's the spirit!
keep 'em coming. $50, 000! That's what we want!
we're winners!
go, skinny, skinny! Put some money in the kitty!
eleven. It's a winner.
we got a shooter now, folks. We got a shooter.
a lucky lady shooter. Keep it coming.
stack it, don't rack it. - Seven, come!
nine! Denzel Washington ain't fine!
all set, folks? - Who's the one?
and I have...
why don't you put it on? It suits you.
well, I can't afford it.
that's too bad.
Yup.
I really think you oughta have the dress.
let me buy it for you.
you want to buy me this dress?
Yeah.
Why? - I've enjoyed watching you.
you've earned it.
no, I haven't.
the dress is for sale. I'm not.
boom! Skinny, skinny!
we got a new shooter now. Coming out. Seven.
roll 'em now, girlfriend.
seven!
come on now! Come on now!
how are you doing? - Can't lose. I'm up over $9, 000. I can't believe it!
it's so great!
Hey, this is my wife, D.
these are my girls. They're gonna be moving in.
kiss 'em.
I'm winning 'cause we're winners! Skinny, skinny!
did I ever tell you I love you? - No.
I do. - Still?
always.
five thousand.
this little pile here? You guessed it.
five more, D. What do you think this is? Five more.
play with it, roll around with it. Enjoy yourself.
Oh, my.
and the grand total is...
25040
so we're halfway there, like, in an hour.
I figure about... two hours tomorrow, we'll be home free. Come here.
what?
I love you.
I know that.
no, I mean even without the money.
last call for wagers. No more bets.
no more bets, please.
forty-one hundred. We said we wouldn't go below 5, 000.
do you want any more coffee?
no, thank you.
tails, we quit; heads, we go for it.
two out of three.
last call for wagers. No more bets.
okay, I'm feeling lucky. I say we put it on red.
all of it. Red.
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?
we can do this, huh?
I'm going to put it all. All right.
I'm putting it on red.
okay.
no, it's black. - What are you doing? - It's black.
no, it's red. It's red.
go with your instinct, right?
no more bets. - Come on, red.
gotta get it.
come on, red. Come on, red.
too late, young lady.
place your bets. Bank side, player side. All set?
cards, please.
turning for the players. Pass is to the right, please.
player draws nothing.
and set.
player side, banker side.
any other bets? - Who's that guy?
that's John Gage.
he's a damn billionaire. That's a rich son of a bitch there.
he's down over a million dollars already.
see them little gold things he's playing with?
ten thousand dollars a piece.
every time he lays one down, 10, 000 big ones.
look at him, how cool he is.
that son of a bitch must get more pussy than you can shake a stick at.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend. - Player wins. - What y'all doing, gambling?
it's about time.
y'all married? - Let's go.
stick around, gamble a little. - Excuse me.
excuse me.
would you mind lending me your wife? Is that your wife?
excuse me?
for luck.
you'd have to ask her.
may I?
go for it. - I don't think it's a good idea.
we should just go. - Just for a moment?
I'll go. - Go ahead. It might be fun. What do we got to lose?
well? - He ain't gonna bite. You go and see what happens.
thank you.
see if she can get a little of that money from him.
do you think she'll ever come back?
I'm just bullshitting you.
have a seat. I've been losing all day long.
you appeared, I win my first hand. You brought me luck.
I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you?
would you like a drink? - No, thank you.
candy?
place your bets.
bank side, player side. - Hundred thousand.
any other bets? - Just like that?
just like that. - All bets set. Twenty-dollar tie-in.
not like that.
sorry.
all bets set. Cards, please.
turning for the players.
what we want...
what we need... is a nine.
we don't like that.
player draws nothing. Cards for the bank, please.
bank's a winner with a natural eight. Pay the bank.
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.
do you like cards? - Not especially.
wish I had asked you sooner. Dice?
Yeah, I guess so.
Sam.
Mr. G.
one. Excuse me, Mr. G.
maybe I should go.
this shouldn't take too long.- What? - This.
now...
I hope you find this interesting.
pit. Tadross.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it's here now.
Yes, sir.
goes for $ 1 million.
it's a bet.
there you are, Mr. G. One million dollars.
bet it all.
coming out. Crap 11 or any 7. This time it is a come out roll. How much goes now? Get 'em down.
pick two.
now just throw a seven.
you wanna throw an 11, that's all right too.
aren't you forgetting something?
everyone.
think I oughta quit now?
I think I should.
credit my account.
sweetie, that was amazing. That was incredible. Oh, my God! Unbelievable.
Hi. John Gage.
Oh, hi. David Murphy.
Hi, David. - Congratulations.
this is my wife Diana. I guess you met.
Hi. Diana?- Diana.
Hi. Thank you both.
very generous of you, David. Are you staying at the hotel?
actually, we're just leaving. - You're leaving?
we're on our way out. - No, don't do that.
we got to celebrate. Let me arrange a room for you here.
that's very nice, but... - I insist.
please, it's the least I can do. Okay?
really, just sign for it. Anything you want.
Oh, there's some lovely shops off the lobby.
have you seen 'em?
let's go.
how 'bout that?
Hey, D. What do you think?
godfather?
you won a million dollars today.
he won it.
you won it for him.
this feels nice.
don't get it. Just stay right here.
okay. - Okay?
hello. William Shackleford.
Hi. David Murphy.
for Mrs. Murphy, from John Gage.
Oh, well, thank him for us. - I'll do that.
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight at his suite at 9: 00.
if you can find the time in your schedule, he'd be most pleased.
look what you got. - What?
gift from Gage.
Really?
open it up.
that's $5, 000.
how do you know that?
I saw it in a store downstairs.
Oh. Lucky for him you like black.
Yeah.
who is that guy, Shackleford?
someone who works for me.
someone I trust.
he killed someone once.
tell me...
where do you see yourself in, say, ten years?
I wouldn't mind being a billionaire like yourself.
nice shot. I mean, beyond money.
what would satisfy you completely, let you sleep well at night?
what, are you saying you're not satisfied?
who is?
I am.
she mean it?
I hope so.
well, then you may not have won in Vegas, but you're a lucky man...
cause I got money, security, I have businesses...
but you have something that I just don't have.
I guess there's limits to what money can buy.
not many.
some things aren't for sale.
such as?
you can't buy people.
that's naive, Diana. I buy people every day.
in business, maybe, but not when real emotions are involved.
you're saying you can't buy love?
that's a bit of a clich?
it's absolutely true.
is it? What do you think?
I agree with Diana. - You do?
let's test the clich?
suppose...
I were to offer you $ 1 million...
for one night with your wife.
I'd assume you're kidding.
let's pretend I'm not.
what would you say?
he'd tell you to go to hell.
I didn't hear him.
I'd tell you to go to hell.
that's a reflex answer because you view it as hypothetical.
but let's say that there were real money behind it.
I'm not kidding. A million dollars.
the night would come and go, but the money could last a lifetime.
think of it.
a million dollars.
a lifetime of security...
for one night.
don't answer right away.
but consider it.
seriously.
we're positive, okay?
then you've answered my question and you've proved your point.
there are limits to what money can buy.
it's late, and I hate to admit it, but I have a meeting.
may I have one dance?
of course, with your permission.
you know something? I think you better get on to that meeting.
you don't want to miss out on your next billion.
understood. I wouldn't part with her either.
good night.
can't sleep?
no.
me neither.
I just keep thinking about it.
it's so weird, isn't it?
Yeah.
David, I think you want me to do it.
what are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous.
well, maybe we should just talk about it.
I don't want you to do it.
but you'd let me do it? - No.
Why? Do you want to do it?
no.
but I would.
I'd do it for you.
for me?
I can't believe we're even talkir about this.
think about what this money could do for us...
what it could do for our future.
you could finish your house.
you could pay your dad back... get rid of our debts.
after all, it wouldn't mean anything.
it's just my body.
it's not my mind. It's not my heart.
you think we could do something like that?
we both slept with other people before we were married, right?
Yeah.
so we'd just have to look at it like that.
I slept with Bubba Aruzio, for God's sake. If I can sleep with Bubba, I can sleep with anyone.
you slept with Bubba?
you knew. - No, I didn't know that.
when did you sleep with Bubba?
when you were off sleeping with that slut, Olivia Daigle.
Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut. Olivia Beagle.
let me in.
she wasn't a slut. - Yes, she was.
she wasn't. - She was. - She wasn't.
unfortunately.
thank God we can laugh about it.
that's easy to say now. After...
we'd just have to forget it ever happened.
and never discuss it, not even once.
I mean, because nothing will have happened.
nothing that matters, anyway.
we have a brilliant script, really very special.
major. - It's a vehicle... a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.
with Billy Ray Cyrus. It's kind of A Star Is Born. So...
your first screenplay sold for half a million.
should've been two. - Except our lawyer caved in on us.
that won't happen again.
we're gonna get a lawyer that's tough, that's savvy.
someone who will step on his grandmother for us.
Mr. Green, a David Murphy would like to speak to you. He says it's urgent.
put him on the speaker. This is an old college buddy.
it'll only take a second. - Jeremy?
Davey, I'm in the middle of a meeting. What's up?
well, listen, we need you to close a deal.
what kind of deal? - A very big deal.
Ooh, big deal. Go on.
we're in Vegas at the Hilton.
we met John Gage. You know who he is?
sure, I know who he is.
a billionaire and major poon hound.
he is?
go on.
he offered us a million dollars.
million dollars? For what, your kidneys?
for one night with Diana.
what do you mean?
one night, like... - Yes.
could you excuse me for a second?
let me get this straight.
he offered you a million dollars for a night with your wife?
as in your wife Diana? And you agreed to it? I don't know what to say.
how could you do something like that?
how could you negotiate without me?
never negotiate without your lawyer. Never!
for a woman like Diana, I could have got you at least two million!
obviously, you don't want to get screwed, and then screwed.
Hey, stay, please. This is damage control.
two seconds. Eat cookies. There's cookies coming.
you don't understand. We've heard enough.
you're hired. - We love your style.
great. Gladys, check the gentlemers schedules.
call me next week. Wednesday? - Great.
see you then. Thanks for coming.
no. Thank you. - No. Thank you.
okay, David, before we go any further...
let's get the moral issue out of the way.
leave that to us. - I was referring to my fee.
I get five percent.
do you want to elaborate on the verification clause?
verification.
that means you pay even if the relationship isn't consummated.
you mean, if I'm impotent.
it's important for a lawyer to cover contingencies.
I can live with that. The John Garfield clause?
that's if you die in the act.
I have no problem with that either. Can I have your pen?
you're pretty good, you know? - Thank you.
you should come work for me.
we have a deal.
a million dollars will be deposited in your casino account... in the morning.
so.
so.
so.
you can go.
gentlemen... I think it's time for men of good will to...
take leave of one another.
it's all right. I don't bite.
so... what, should I go undress?
cheer up. You got to find a more creative way to think about this.
look at it like an episode of The Dating Game that went awry.
you know
ladies and gentlemen...
we wish to welcome you to our jamboree.
first punch, over he went. I couldn't believe it.
I know we could have gotten two million.
here's your Buddha.
Davey, no point getting out the crying towel. You got a million bucks, buddy.
a million bucks.
she's an amazing woman. She really is.
couldn't have gotten 500 for my girlfriend.
not that I'd do that.
but it's okay that you did.
this is a different situation. She agreed to it. You've gotta remember that.
it's not like it's hard duty. He's a great-looking guy.
for a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.
maybe not.
Hey, buddy!
come on.
come on!
what have I done?
what have I done?
D! It's me!
D!
where is she? Where's my wife?
where is she?
Diana!
where did she go? What happened to her?
Where'd they go? - Up, up.
up where?
D!
D!
they sent for me.
they said you were ready.
come here.
you missed a button.
thank you.
I want to show you something.
what happened? Lights went off.
I see that. Why?
look.
can you turn those off too?
I'm working on it.
who made the decision?
we both did. Nah.
do it for your own reasons, or don't do it.
you don't know him. - I know he didn't stop you.
if you were mine...
I wouldn't share you with anyone.
you have no right to judge David.
you're the one who has to buy women.
you think I have to buy women?
why me, then?
I bought you because you said you couldn't be bought.
I can't be bought.
we're just gonna fuck, as I understand it.
you might enjoy it.
don't bet on it.
I think I will.
heads, we do...
tails, we call the whole thing off, turn the boat around, go home.
no hard feelings.
what do you say?
it's your party.
this is my lucky dollar...
so I can't lose.
trust me.
nothing's gonna happen you don't choose.
I told myself it was over...
like a dream that vanishes in the morning light...
and in time... enough time... I would forget.
a little fixer-upper south of Wilshire. It's nothing. Yeah.
I've got people here.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
sorry. I'm here for you now.
all right, two acres on Alta Loma.
alta Vista. - Vista. That's right.
Murphy property.
we've been a little late on the payments, want to settle up.
I don't think that's possible.
what do you mean? - The mortgage is two months in default...
and it appears that the property is in contract to another party.
to another party? - Who? - That's privileged information.
how can that be?
we called specifically for an extension.
the extension expired two days ago.
if you don't make a payment, the bank can repossess.
without prior notice? Can they do that?
they don't have to warn us.
but, in fact, an attempt was made to call you on the third...
and a registered letter, return receipt requested... was attempted on the fourth.
apparently there was no one home.
we were out of town.
well, I am sorry... but you snooze, you lose.
you snooze, you lose.
you snooze, you lose"?
it's an expression. - Oh, that's beautiful.
bullshit!
this is bullshit, man! Don't deal with these people.
they sold us out. They'll sell you out too.
Hi. Wanna help me in the garden?
okay.
our tomatoes are looking good. Don't you think?
David?
what's "Gryphon"?
Gryphon.
Where'd you hear that name?
you have a box of matches.
we said we wouldn't talk about it.
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.
don't you?
no. D.
I thought I could forget about this, but I can't.
so I think...
maybe if we just talk about it we can put it behind us.
Gryphors a boat.
he took you to a boat?
in Nevada? - We flew to Santa Barbara.
what kind of boat? - A big boat.
and then what? And then nothing.
where did you get the matches?
have you been going through my bag? - No.
Why? What's in your bag?
I'm not gonna talk about this. I'm not gonna do it.
what?
who are you talking to?
my mother.
and what did Mom have to say?
nothing. She wasn't there.
you said you were talking to her. How could you if she wasn't there?
well, I was trying to talk to her... but I didn't reach her.
she wasn't in after 10: 00?
no. If you don't believe me, would you like to talk to her yourself?
what is the matter with you?
what is that?
you know what it is.
where did you get this? - In your wallet.
I've never seen it before. - It was in the secret compartment.
I don't even use that.
have you been seeing him? - No, I haven't.
you can't stop thinking about him. - You won't let me.
why were you in my wallet, anyway? - I don't trust you.
well, I don't trust you either.
well, then we're even.
I had to do something.
I wanted to make something good out of all we'd done wrong.
I decided to try and buy our land back.
I need to find out the guy's name. I wanna make him an offer.
I'm gonna get killed for this, Diana.
I don't want you to get in trouble. I really appreciate it.
there it is. Right there.
back up. - Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.
Oh, my God. This guy's never gonna sell.
I just saw this guy on TV.
you bastard! You stole our property!
gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a friend...
I'm not your friend.
Diana advised me on a piece of property in Santa Monica.
you're a liar. You took it, and I want it back.
can we have a... Everything's fine. Everything's under control. Very well, sir.
excuse me.
I'm taking it off.
wait a minute.
did you just want to hurt me?
nonsense. I think you're wonderful.
that was our house. - I got there first.
I want you to sell it back to me.
you can't afford it. - Oh? How's a million dollars?
the price is two.
if I had two, the price would be four, right?
I saw an opportunity and I took it.
you had the money and the right instincts, but you were too late.
I want you to work for me. - You go to hell.
listen, I mean it.
never. - Why not?
because I hate you. - No, you don't.
you wish you hated me.
Hi, D.
you look awful.
where you been? - I'll tell you about it.
gonna have some wine first.
do you want some?
so, where you been?
last night I was up for hours trying to figure a way out of this mess.
and today?
and today I saw Gage.
thank you for your trust, David... and for listening.
did you fuck him? - No.
but you wanted to.
I met him in broad daylight in front of a bunch of rich assholes.
I don't believe you.
David, he bought our property. Okay?
that's why I went to see him... to find some way to get it back.
you have no reason to be jealous. I hate him.
tell me what happened on that boat.
don't do this!
Why? - 'Cause I want to know.
all right, I'll tell you. The man was a fucking stallion.
should I say we did it all night? Does that do it for you?
is that the truth? - You don't want the fucking truth.
you want me to lie.
so I'll tell you he's awful, and you won't believe me.
just tell me the truth, D.
it was sex, David. Just sex. Not love.
was it good sex?
don't do this. - Can you just tell me that?
what are you hesitating for? Just tell me. Was it good?
was it good? Was it good?
Yes.
David.
don't tell me it was just sex.
you were attracted to him all along.
that's bullshit. David, I did it for you.
don't you tell me you did it for me.
you did it for yourself. You were dying to do it.
I would never do this for myself. It was all for you.
don't lie to me! You were attracted to him!
I knew something like this was gonna happen.
I guess you make a deal with the devil...
and eventually you pay the price.
Thanks, Jeremy.
coming from the man who closed the deal, that's very comforting.
green.
Oh, hi, Di.
I'm not here.
Yeah, he's right here. You wanna speak to him?
no, I don't want to talk to him.
look, sweetie... he loves you... you love him.
you gotta try and work this out. It's all pretty simple, right?
this is a deal even I can't screw up.
tell him he can keep the money.
I don't want any of it.
Davey... she says she doesn't want the money.
I don't want the money either.
I'll take it.
I mean, if nobody else wants it.
the next few weeks without David felt like months.
I got very good at staring at walls.
Diana. The recession has ended.
there's a fella out there wants to see ten-million-dollar homes.
there is a God.
find someone else.
find someone else? Are you nuts?
do you know what the commission is on $ 10 million?
I can't do it. - You have to do it.
you're the best one I have.
you're the only one I have. The others are all on caravan.
I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. I can't. - Diana.
I would never dream of forcing you to do anything against your will.
except this one time.
now move your ass, or you're fired.
if you think this is gonna work, you underestimate me.
you are truly beautiful.
what do you think you're doing?
looking for a house.
well, there's Bel-Air, Holmby Hills, Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.
where would you like to go first?
Paris.
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.
the ceilings are French gothic.
renaissance paintings, as you can see.
parquet floors throughout.
the bathrooms are Italian marble.
this is the master bath.
why didn't you return any of my calls?
do you like it?
no.
thirty million, minimum. - Do you think?
I know. - Well, let's look at it.
it's not for sale.
everything's for sale.
this is your house, isn't it?
do you like it?
well, it's certainly beautiful.
what do you think it needs?
tell me honestly.
I think it needs a life.
I think it needs furniture...
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.
it needs you.
just forget it. It just won't work.
why not?
because from where we started, we've got nowhere to go.
you don't know that.
I've never started this way either.
I need you.
no.
you collect things.
don't you?
sometimes.
even if you were extremely rich... and extremely smart... can you be president?
no
you couldn't be president?
why not?
I took a second job teaching citizenship just to keep busy.
where were you born?
I was born in Seoul, Korea.
where was she born?
she was born in Seoul, Korea.
where were you born, Miguel?
sorry.
welcome back. Where were you born?
Cuba.
so, how do we say "Cuba" in America?
Cuba.
what are you doing here?
isn't this the citizenship class?- Yes. - Can I sit in?
it's full.
Cuba. Cuba. - Thank you.
okay,
I have a question for you, Lucy.
excuse me. Is there something you'd like to share with us?
I was just saying that you're an amazing woman.
and...
beautiful.
and talented.
and I am crazy about her.
you're full of surprises, aren't you?
I'm trying like hell.
I think maybe you should go.
you want me to go?
nice people. They want the dream.
they saw it in the flesh tonight.
you have chalk on your face.
I have something I want to show you.
I didn't know whether you liked big ones or little ones.
Oh, you're so beautiful. Come here.
I didn't have much time to do anything else...
but... it's a start.
dance?
I should go.
I remember once when I was young, I was coming back from someplace.
a movie or something. I was on the subway.
there was a girl sitting across from me.
she was wearing this dress that was buttoned...
clear up right to here.
she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I was shy then.
so when she would look at me... I would look away.
then afterwards, when I would look back... she would look away.
then I got to where I was gonna get off.
got off, the doors closed...
and as the train was pulling away...
she looked right at me...
and gave me the most incredible smile.
it was awful.
I wanted to tear the doors open.
I went back every night, same time... for two weeks.
but she never showed up.
that was 30 years ago...
and I don't think there's a day that goes by... that I don't think about her.
I don't want that to happen again.
just one dance?
I want a word with you, Gage.
see, what you don't know is, we got a secret, me and Diana.
we're invincible.
Diana, you're so fucking beautiful.
maybe tomorrow would be better.
maybe tomorrow would be a better time?
Hey, I got a suggestion for you.
you know that emblem you got? The gryphon? The eagle?
I don't think that's a good idea. I got a better idea.
shall I? - It's all right.
how about the cuckoo?
you know? Because... I'm talking to you for a second.
the cuckoo is interesting because it doesn't have its own nest...
so it moves into other birds' nests and it destroys their eggs.
David, stop. Just...
you don't love me anymore?
have I ever told you I love you?
have a nice dinner.
go inside.
got him?
you've done a lot since USC.
first in your class...
aia award, Prix de Rome.
why would you want this job?
well, I want to work.
overqualified.
fine. Exploit me.
great architecture is only gonna come from your passion.
and even that won't assure you a job.
Louis Kahn died in a mers room in Penn Station...
and for days no one claimed the body.
look at that. Is that beautiful?
the money men did not weep...
because the great ones are impossible to deal with.
they're a pain in the ass... because they know that if they do their jobs properly...
if they just this once get it right...
they can actually lift the human spirit... take it to a higher place.
what is this? - A brick.
good. What else?
a weapon.
Louis Kahn said even a brick wants to be something.
a brick wants to be something.
it aspires.
even a common, ordinary brick...
wants to be something more than it is.
it wants to be something better than it is.
that is what we must be.
see you on Friday.
a brick wants to be something, huh?
I'll bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.
what are you doing here? - I missed you.
I missed you too. - Thanks.
how you doing? - I'm good. Getting it together.
she wants a divorce.
she wants her freedom and...
if you don't contest it... you get everything...
the land, the money, everything.
where is she?
Hi, everybody!
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly. Good-bye, everybody.
you may wonder what you're doing here...
sitting in the sun as the smell of the zoo wafts past your nostrils.
the reason you are here is because you are loaded.
but may I say how brilliant it is to see so many with an interest in the preservation of endangered species.
every year we have this unique way of making money for the cause.
we auction animals. We bid as high as possible...
and the money goes to sponsor these lovely beasts.
let's start with a bang.
we've got a superstar as a first animal.
ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.
the animal itself is far too big and angry to bring along.
look at this guy.
thousands and thousands of pounds of aggressive, hostile cellulite.
weighs slightly less than the average school bus.
look at that magnificent beastie.
to put him in a better light, to relieve you of some serious money...
thank you very much.
we have a kissy-kissy picture.
isn't that nice?
ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't even dream of starting the bid...
below $ 10, 000.
now, I know it's a lot of money... - Thirty.
thirty thousand dollars, ladies and gentlemen!
call me a sentimental old fool.
do I hear 35?
thirty-five. - Thirty-five thousand dollars!
forty. - Forty thousand dollars!
forty-five thousand. - Forty-five thousand!
fifty. - Fifty thousand dollars!
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary. Fifty thousand once.
fifty thousand twice, ladies and gentlemen.
one million dollars.
Wow. - Who is he?
I'm sorry?
one million dollars.
did you say one million dollars, sir? - Yeah.
ladies and gentlemen, one million dollars!
goodness! Would anybody care to top that, ladies and gentlemen?
I didn't think so.
in that case, sir, I believe you're the proud owner of a hippo.
Congratulations.
Hello, Diana. Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal is an ostrich.
I really wanted you to have that money.
and I really wanted you to have that hippo.
maybe you two would like a moment alone.
so.
how are you... - I hear you're teaching. - Go ahead. - I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm teaching.
it doesn't pay much, but at least I get to talk about architecture.
you know how I love to talk about architecture.
Oh, my goodness. Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's just a little shower. Please!
a checkbook makes an ideal umbrella.
do we have a dolphin? Have we a dolphin or an octopus? How about tropical fish?
I have to talk to you about what happened.
don't. Don't. - No, no, no, I have to.
just hear me out.
I think the mistake I made in Vegas...
was thinking that I could forget what we did.
I thought we were invincible.
but now I know that the things people in love do to each other...
they remember.
if they stay together, it's not because they forget.
it's because they forgive.
I was just...
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.
no, actually I was afraid that you were right to want him.
cause I thought he was the better man.
and I know now he's not.
he's just got more money.
I think we should talk.
I am very happy.
Shackleford. Did you ever see me like this?
can't say that I have.
Diana is the reason.
enough for any man.
she is the best of them. Absolutely.
you are the best of them.
the best of them?
you said I'm the best of them?
you are.
I don't understand.
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?
what?
I could do that, sir...
but somehow I feel Ms. Murphy would rather hear it directly from you.
okay. All right.
she's the best of the million-dollar club. Obviously.
the million-dollar club? - Now you've got it.
you told me you'd never done that before.
how many members would you say there are?
members? - Yeah.
worldwide? - Yeah.
a couple dozen.
remember the one that wouldn't stop hiccuping?
what? - The waitress from Oklahoma.
every time you came near her she would convulse into hiccups.
Yeah, I had forgotten. Quite a night.
the best thing of it is...
you know if you're sexually compatible...
right from the start.
Shackleford, would you stop the car?
thank you, John.
good-bye.
good-bye.
here.
for luck.
take care of him. - Sure.
what was all that about?
I wanted to end it.
she never would have looked at me the way she did at him.
seven years ago David proposed to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.
I wanted to go there to remember... and start over.
have I ever told you I love you?
no.
I do.
still?
always.
dismount!
Herman's horse-sick!
chaps, no one wander off.
some of the passageways in here can run for miles.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
what is it?
Alfred, did you get anything yet?
nothing.
then keep digging.
the kid's got something!
Whoo! Yee-hoo!
I got something, Garth!
I got something... I got something right here.
Oh, look at that!
Whoo!
we're rich! We're rich!
shut up. Shut up.
well, we're rich, ain't we?
what are they doing?
Shh!
Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.
it's the Cross of Coronado.
Cortez gave it to him in 1 520.
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama, dig down and put it on her bony finger!
that cross is an important artifact.
it belongs in a museum.
run back and find the others.
tell Mr. Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.
have him bring the sheriff.
it's only a snake.
did you hear what I said?
right. Run back...
Mr. Havelock... the sheriff...
what, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
dig with your hands, not with your mouth.
he's got our thing!
get him! -Get off me!
Mr. Havelock!
anybody!
everybody's lost but me.
there he is!
let's go! Let's go!
Hey! Hey, you! -Dang it!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hey!
come back here!
come on! Get him!
Hey, come back here!
Oh!
Aah... Oh!
here, let me.
Oh, oh...
holy smokes!
come on, kid.
there's no way out of this.
Hey!
toss up the whip.
you got heart, kid, but that belongs to me.
it belongs to Coronado.
Coronado is dead, and so are all of his grandchildren.
this should be in a museum.
now give it back!
a snake!
snake! Aah!
don't let him get away!
magic?
hold it.
make sure he doesn't double back.
okay, kid, out of the box, now.
son of a...
damn.
dad!
dad!
dad.
dad... Out.
it's important.
then wait. Count to 20.
no, Dad. You listen to me.
one, two, three, four...
in Greek.
may he who illuminated this...
illuminate me.
I brought the sheriff.
just the man I want to see.
now, there were five or six of them...
it's all right, son. -They came after me...
you still got it?
well, yes, sir.
it's right here.
I'm glad to see that...
because the rightful owner of this cross won't press charges if you give it back.
he's got witnesses, five or six of them.
Whoo! Yeah!
good day.
you lost today, kid, but it doesn't mean you have to like it.
small world, Dr. Jones.
too small for two of us.
this is the second time
I've had to reclaim my property from you.
that belongs in a museum.
so do you.
throw him over the side.
grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!
archaeology is the search for fact...
...not truth.
if it's truth you're interested in,
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class is right down the hall.
so forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world.
we do not follow maps to buried treasure, and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.
seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library.
research. Reading.
we cannot afford to take mythology at face value.
next week: "Egyptology."
starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Flinders Petrie in 1 885.
I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems, for the next hour and a half.
Marcus, I did it.
you've got it!
Oh!
you know how long I've been looking for that?
all your life.
all my life.
well done, lndy.
very well done, indeed.
this will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
we can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.
your treat.
Yes.
my treat.
Dr. Jones! Dr. Jones!
shush! Shush! Shush!
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.
your mail is on your desk.
here are your phone messages.
Dr. Jones, you promised...
this is your appointment schedule, and these term papers still haven't been graded.
okay. Irene, put everybody's name on a list, get the order they arrived...
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
Dr. Jones.
...and I'll see each and every one of them...
in turn.
Venice, Italy.
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones?
I trust your trip down was comfortable, Dr. Jones.
uh, my men didn't alarm you, I hope.
my name is Donovan.
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.
your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous.
some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.
have a look over here.
this might interest you.
well, it's sandstone.
christian symbol.
early Latin text.
Mid-1 2th century, I should think.
that was our assessment, as well.
where did this come from?
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.
can you translate the inscription?
...who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, "will have a... spring "inside him welling up for eternal life.
let them bring me to your holy mountain "in the place where you dwell."
across the desert "and through the mountain" to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the temple where the cup that...
where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
the Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.
the chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper.
the cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea.
the Arthur legend.
I've heard this bedtime story before.
eternal life, Dr. Jones!
the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.
now, that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to.
an old man's dream.
every man's dream, including your father's, I believe.
Grail lore is his hobby.
he's a teacher of medieval literature.
the one the students hope they don't get.
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.
be along in a moment, dear.
hard to resist, isn't it?
the Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail.
what good is it?
this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.
it's pretty vague.
where do you want to start looking?
maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing.
just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr. Jones.
after the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade.
three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one, as well.
two of these brothers walked out of the desert 1 50 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it.
and before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think.
not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story.
it doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would.
this tablet is one of those markers.
it proves the knight's story is true.
but as you pointed out, it's incomplete.
now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.
our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.
as you can now see, Dr. Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost 2, 000 years ago.
we're only one step away.
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
you could be more right than you know.
yes?
we've hit a snag.
our project leader has vanished, along with all his research.
uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Dr. Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.
I want you to pick up the trail where he left off.
find the man, and you will find the Grail.
you've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.
why don't you try my father?
we already have.
your father is the man who has disappeared.
your father and I have been friends since time began.
I've watched you grow up, lndy.
I've watched the two of you grow apart.
I've never seen you this concerned about him before.
dad?
he's an academic; a bookworm.
he's not a field man.
dad? Dad?
dear God.
what has the old fool got himself into now?
I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head.
dad?
it's today's mail, and it's been opened.
mail.
that's it, Marcus.
Venice, Italy.
what is it?
it's Dad's Grail diary.
every clue he followed.
every discovery he made.
a complete record of his search for the Holy Grail.
this is his whole life.
why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly.
do you believe, Marcus?
do you believe the Grail actually exists?
the search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
but if you want facts, lndy,
I've none to give you.
at my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
call Donovan, Marcus.
tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
all right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice.
don't worry, Dr. Schneider will be there to meet you.
uh, Schneider? -I maintain an apartment in Venice. It's at your disposal.
Oh, well, that's good.
thank you.
Dr. Jones... good luck.
now be very careful.
don't trust anybody.
Ah, Venice...
Yes.
uh, how will we recognize this Dr. Schneider when we see him?
I don't know.
maybe he'll know us.
Dr. Jones?
yes?
I knew it was you.
you have your father's eyes.
and my mother's ears, but the rest belongs to you.
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
that's right.
Dr. Elsa Schneider.
Oh, how do you do?
the last time I saw your father, we were in the library.
he was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb.
I've never seen him so excited.
he was as giddy as a schoolboy.
who? Attila the Professor?
he was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy.
will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't, either.
in that case, I permit you.
it would make me very happy.
but I'm already sad.
by tomorrow, it will have faded.
tomorrow I'll steal you another.
I hate to interrupt you, but the reason we're here...
Yes. I have something to show you.
I left your father working in the library.
he sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city.
when I got back to his table, he'd gone, with all his papers, except for that scrap, which I found near his chair.
Roman numerals.
here is the library.
that doesn't look much like a library.
looks like a converted church.
in this case, it's the literal truth.
we are on holy ground.
these columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
now, please excuse me.
the library's closing in a few moments.
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
Marcus... I've seen this window before.
where?
right here, in Dad's diary.
you see?
look, lndy.
the Roman numerals.
dad was onto something here.
well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
dad sent me this diary for a reason.
until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
find something?
uh, yes. Three, seven and ten.
that window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
my God, I must be blind.
dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb, he was looking for the tomb itself.
don't you get it?
the tomb is somewhere in the library.
you said yourself it used to be a church.
look.
three.
three.
seven.
seven. Ten.
and ten.
now where's the ten?
look around for the ten.
three and seven.
seven and seven and ten.
ten.
"X" marks the spot.
bingo.
you don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.
you're a great deal like your father.
except he's lost, and I'm not.
lower me down.
look after this for me, will you?
come on.
pagan symbols.
fourth or fifth century.
right.
600 years before the Crusades.
the Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
that's right.
if there's a knight of the First Crusade down here, that's where we'll find him.
what's this one?
the Ark of the Covenant.
are you sure?
pretty sure.
watch out.
it's petroleum.
I should sink a well down here and retire.
give me the lighter.
Oh, rats.
Ugh!
come on.
come here.
look, it...
it must be one of these.
look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork.
it's this one.
this is it.
we found it.
look.
the engraving on the shield, it's the same as on the Grail tablet.
the shield is the second marker.
what's that?
it's a rubbing
dad made of the Grail tablet.
just like your father-- giddy as a schoolboy.
wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
he never would have made it past the rats.
he hates rats.
he's scared to death of them.
get back!
back against the wall.
quick! Under it!
air pocket!
don't wander off.
what?
What?!
I think I've found a way out.
deep breath.
Ah, Venice.
Whoa!
are you crazy?! Don't go between them!
go between them? Are you crazy?!
I said go around!
you said go between them!
I said, don't go between them!
No!
why are you trying to kill us?
because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
my father was looking for the Holy Grail.
did you kill him too?
no.
where is he?
talk or you're dead.
damn it, tell me!
tell me!
if you don't let go, Dr. Jones, we'll both die.
then we'll die.
my soul is prepared. How's yours?
this is your last chance.
no, Dr. Jones, it's yours.
all right, where's my father?
if you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
who are you?
my name is Kazim.
and why were you trying to kill me?
the secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years, and for all that time, the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
let me off at this jetty.
ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ?
is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.
in that case, God be with you in your quest.
your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald, on the Austrian-German border.
how's the head?
it's better, now I've seen this.
it's the name of a city.
"Alexandretta"?
Hmm...
the knights of the First Crusade
laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year.
the entire city was destroyed.
the present city of lskenderun is built on its ruins.
Marcus, you remember what the Grail tablet said:
across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
but where exactly?
your father would know.
Mm.
your father did know.
look. He made a map.
he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail quest.
a map with no names.
now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here.
he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains, here.
straight to the canyon.
he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta.
now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
tell him to meet you in lskenderun.
what about you?
I'm going after Dad.
Oh! Oh...
my room...
mine, too.
what were they looking for?
this.
the Grail diary?
Uh-huh.
you had it?
you didn't trust me.
I didn't know you.
at least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes.
give them a flower, and they'll follow you anywhere.
knock it off. You're not mad.
no?
no. You like the way I do things.
it's lucky I don't do things the same way.
you'd still be standing at the Venice pier!
look, what do you think is going on here?
since I met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait.
we're caught in the middle of something sinister here.
my guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for.
and until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
how dare you kiss me!
leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
and I hate...
arrogant men.
Ah, Venice.
what do you know about this place?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
what are you going to do?
don't know.
I'll think of something.
yes?
and not before time!
did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day?
we're drenched!
now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.
are you expected?
do not take that tone with me, my good man.
now butt off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant...
...are here to view the tapestries.
tapestries?
dear me, the man is dense.
this is a castle, isn't it?
there are tapestries?
this is a castle, and we have many tapestries.
but if you are a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse!
how dare he?
Nazis. I hate these guys.
this one. I think he's in here.
how do you know?
because it's wired.
don't worry... this is kid's play.
I'll be right back.
Yes, sir.
it is you, Junior!
don't call me that, please.
well, what are you doing here?
I came to get you. What do you thi...?
late 1 4th century, Ming dynasty.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
and the head. You hit me, Dad.
I'll never forgive myself.
don't worry, I'm fine.
thank God.
it's fake.
see, you can tell by the cross section.
No!
dad, get your stuff.
we've got to get out of here.
well, I'm sorry about your head, though, but I thought you were one of them.
dad, they come in through the doors.
good point.
but better safe than sorry.
hmm, so I was wrong this time.
but, by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my diary.
you obviously got it.
I got it, and I used it.
we found the entrance to the catacombs.
through the library?
right.
I knew it.
and the tomb of Sir Richard?
found it.
he was actually there?
you saw him?
well, what was left of him.
and his shield...
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?
Alexandretta.
Alexandretta! Of course!
on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire.
Oh...
junior, you did it.
no, Dad. You did.
forty years.
Oh, if only I could have been with you.
there were rats, Dad.
rats?
Yeah, big ones.
what do the Nazis want with you, Dad?
they wanted my diary.
yeah?
I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
Yeah.
Dr. Jones.
yes?
I will take the book now.
what book?
you have the diary in your pocket.
you dolt!
do you think my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here?
you didn't, did you?
you didn't bring it, did you?
well, uh...
you did.
look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
will you take it easy?
take it easy?!
why do you think I sent it home in the first place?
so it wouldn't fall into their hands!
I came here to save you!
Oh, yeah?
and who's gonna come to save you, Junior?
I told you...
...don't call me Junior!
look what you did!
I can't believe what you did...
that's far enough. Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.
put down the gun, or the Fraulein dies.
but she's one of them.
Indy, please!
she's a Nazi.
What?!
trust me.
lndy, no! -I will kill her!
yeah? Go ahead!
No! Don't shoot!
don't worry. He won't.
Indy, please! Do what he says!
and don't listen to her.
enough! She dies!
wait! Wait...
I'm sorry.
no, don't be.
but... you should have listened to your father.
she ransacked her own room, and I fell for it.
how did you know she was a Nazi?
hmm?
how did you know she was a Nazi?
she talks in her sleep.
I didn't trust her. Why did you?
because he didn't take my advice.
didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Dr. Jones?
I misjudged you, Walter.
I knew you would sell your mother for an Etruscan vase, but I didn't know you would sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
Dr. Schneider...
there are pages torn out of this.
this book contained a map, a map with no names, precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
so it did.
where are these missing pages, this map?
we must have these pages back.
you're wasting your breath.
he won't tell us, and he doesn't have to.
it's perfectly obvious where the pages are.
he's given them to Marcus Brody.
you didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you?
he's not up to the challenge.
he sticks out like a sore thumb.
we'll find him.
the hell you will.
he's got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs.
Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan.
he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom.
he'll blend in, disappear.
you'll never see him again.
with any luck, he's got the Grail already.
does anyone here speak English?
or even ancient Greek?
uh, water? No, thank you, sir.
no. Fish make love in it.
goodness me.
thank you so much.
no, I don't like that.
no, I really don't want...
no, no, thank you very much.
no, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.
does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?
Mr. Brody!
Oh, Sallah. What a relief.
Marcus Brody, sir.
but where is lndy?
Oh, he's in Austria.
a slight detour.
you are on your own?
Yes, but don't panic.
everything's under control.
have you, have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course.
but where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you.
it was drawn by, uh, Mr. Brody.
welcome to lskenderun.
the director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.
Oh, well... your servant, sir.
and I am his.
follow me, please.
my reputation precedes me.
there is no museum in lskenderun.
papers, please.
papers?
of course.
run.
Yes.
papers. Got it here.
just finished reading it myself.
run.
Yes.
"Egyptian Mail," morning edition.
run.
did you say, uh...
run!
okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!
find the back door! Find the back door!
intolerable.
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.
you must return immediately.
a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
so?
your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level.
thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at lskenderun.
take this diary to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.
it will show them our progress, ahead of schedule.
without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.
let me kill them now.
no.
if we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive.
always do what the doctor orders.
don't look at me like that.
we both wanted the Grail.
I would have done anything to get it.
you would have done the same.
I'm sorry you think so.
I can't forget how wonderful it was.
thank you.
it was rather wonderful.
Oh, Dr. Schneider.
your car is waiting.
that's how Austrians say good-bye.
and this is how we say good-bye in Germany, Dr. Jones.
Oh!
I liked the Austrian way better.
so did l.
let's try and get these ropes loose.
we've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do.
you said he had two days' start.
that he would blend in. Disappear.
are you kidding? I made that up.
you know Marcus.
he got lost once in his own museum.
Oh...
can you try and reach my left jacket pocket?
what am I looking for?
my lucky charm.
feels like a cigarette lighter.
try and burn through the ropes.
very good.
Oh!
I ought to tell you something.
don't get sentimental now, dad.
save it till we get out of here.
the floor's on fire.
see? -What?
and the chair.
move! Move it out of here!
go!
it's scorching the table! Fast!
move! -Okay!
well, we have Marcus Brody, but more important, we have the map.
by the personal command of the Fuhrer.
secrecy essential to success.
eliminate the American conspirators.
germany has declared war on the Jones boys.
dad! -What?
dad!
what?
dad! -What?
head for the fireplace!
Oh.
I think I can get these ropes off.
Whoops.
our situation has not improved.
listen, Dad, I'm almost free.
alarm!
this is intolerable.
I'm out, Dad.
well done, boy.
come on, Dad.
dead end.
there's got to be a...
a secret door or a...
passageway or something.
I find that if I just sit down and think...
dad!
...the solution presents itself.
great. More boats.
you say this has been just another typical day for you, huh?
No! But better than most.
come on, Dad. Come on.
what about the boat?
dismount!
Herman's horse-sick!
chaps, no one wander off.
some of the passageways in here can run for miles.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
what is it?
Alfred, did you get anything yet?
nothing.
then keep digging.
the kid's got something!
Whoo! Yee-hoo!
I got something, Garth!
I got something... I got something right here.
Oh, look at that!
Whoo!
we're rich! We're rich!
shut up. Shut up.
well, we're rich, ain't we?
what are they doing?
Shh!
Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.
it's the Cross of Coronado.
Cortez gave it to him in 1 520.
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama, dig down and put it on her bony finger!
that cross is an important artifact.
it belongs in a museum.
run back and find the others.
tell Mr. Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.
have him bring the sheriff.
it's only a snake.
did you hear what I said?
right. Run back...
Mr. Havelock... the sheriff...
what, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
dig with your hands, not with your mouth.
he's got our thing!
get him! -Get off me!
Mr. Havelock!
anybody!
everybody's lost but me.
there he is!
let's go! Let's go!
Hey! Hey, you! -Dang it!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hey!
come back here!
come on! Get him!
Hey, come back here!
Oh!
Aah... Oh!
here, let me.
Oh, oh...
holy smokes!
come on, kid.
there's no way out of this.
Hey!
toss up the whip.
you got heart, kid, but that belongs to me.
it belongs to Coronado.
Coronado is dead, and so are all of his grandchildren.
this should be in a museum.
now give it back!
a snake!
snake! Aah!
don't let him get away!
magic?
hold it.
make sure he doesn't double back.
okay, kid, out of the box, now.
son of a...
damn.
dad!
dad!
dad.
dad... Out.
it's important.
then wait. Count to 20.
no, Dad. You listen to me.
one, two, three, four...
in Greek.
may he who illuminated this...
illuminate me.
I brought the sheriff.
just the man I want to see.
now, there were five or six of them...
it's all right, son. -They came after me...
you still got it?
well, yes, sir.
it's right here.
I'm glad to see that...
because the rightful owner of this cross won't press charges if you give it back.
he's got witnesses, five or six of them.
Whoo! Yeah!
good day.
you lost today, kid, but it doesn't mean you have to like it.
small world, Dr. Jones.
too small for two of us.
this is the second time
I've had to reclaim my property from you.
that belongs in a museum.
so do you.
throw him over the side.
grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!
archaeology is the search for fact...
...not truth.
if it's truth you're interested in,
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class is right down the hall.
so forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel, and digging up the world.
we do not follow maps to buried treasure, and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.
seventy percent of all archaeology is done in the library.
research. Reading.
we cannot afford to take mythology at face value.
next week: "Egyptology."
starting with the excavation of Naukratis by Flinders Petrie in 1 885.
I will be in my office if anybody's got any problems, for the next hour and a half.
Marcus, I did it.
you've got it!
Oh!
you know how long I've been looking for that?
all your life.
all my life.
well done, lndy.
very well done, indeed.
this will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
we can discuss my honorarium over dinner and champagne tonight.
your treat.
Yes.
my treat.
Dr. Jones! Dr. Jones!
shush! Shush! Shush!
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.
your mail is on your desk.
here are your phone messages.
Dr. Jones, you promised...
this is your appointment schedule, and these term papers still haven't been graded.
okay. Irene, put everybody's name on a list, get the order they arrived...
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
Dr. Jones.
...and I'll see each and every one of them...
in turn.
Venice, Italy.
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones?
I trust your trip down was comfortable, Dr. Jones.
uh, my men didn't alarm you, I hope.
my name is Donovan.
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.
your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous.
some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.
have a look over here.
this might interest you.
well, it's sandstone.
christian symbol.
early Latin text.
Mid-1 2th century, I should think.
that was our assessment, as well.
where did this come from?
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.
can you translate the inscription?
...who drinks the water I shall give him, says the Lord, "will have a... spring "inside him welling up for eternal life.
let them bring me to your holy mountain "in the place where you dwell."
across the desert "and through the mountain" to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, to the temple where the cup that...
where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.
the Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.
the chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper.
the cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea.
the Arthur legend.
I've heard this bedtime story before.
eternal life, Dr. Jones!
the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.
now, that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to.
an old man's dream.
every man's dream, including your father's, I believe.
Grail lore is his hobby.
he's a teacher of medieval literature.
the one the students hope they don't get.
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.
be along in a moment, dear.
hard to resist, isn't it?
the Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail.
what good is it?
this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons.
it's pretty vague.
where do you want to start looking?
maybe if the tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on, but the entire top portion is missing.
just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.
let me tell you another bedtime story, Dr. Jones.
after the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathea, it disappeared, and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the First Crusade.
three brothers, to be exact.
I've heard this one, as well.
two of these brothers walked out of the desert 1 50 years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France, but only one of them made it.
and before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a... to a Franciscan friar, I think.
not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story.
it doesn't reveal the location of the Grail, I'm afraid, but the knight promised that two markers, that had been left behind, would.
this tablet is one of those markers.
it proves the knight's story is true.
but as you pointed out, it's incomplete.
now, the second marker is entombed with the knight's dead brother.
our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.
as you can now see, Dr. Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost 2, 000 years ago.
we're only one step away.
that's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
you could be more right than you know.
yes?
we've hit a snag.
our project leader has vanished, along with all his research.
uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Dr. Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.
I want you to pick up the trail where he left off.
find the man, and you will find the Grail.
you've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.
why don't you try my father?
we already have.
your father is the man who has disappeared.
your father and I have been friends since time began.
I've watched you grow up, lndy.
I've watched the two of you grow apart.
I've never seen you this concerned about him before.
dad?
he's an academic; a bookworm.
he's not a field man.
dad? Dad?
dear God.
what has the old fool got himself into now?
I don't know, but whatever it is, he's in over his head.
dad?
it's today's mail, and it's been opened.
mail.
that's it, Marcus.
Venice, Italy.
what is it?
it's Dad's Grail diary.
every clue he followed.
every discovery he made.
a complete record of his search for the Holy Grail.
this is his whole life.
why would he have sent this to me?
I don't know, but someone must want it pretty badly.
do you believe, Marcus?
do you believe the Grail actually exists?
the search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
but if you want facts, lndy,
I've none to give you.
at my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
call Donovan, Marcus.
tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
all right, tell me what's going to happen when we get to Venice.
don't worry, Dr. Schneider will be there to meet you.
uh, Schneider? -I maintain an apartment in Venice. It's at your disposal.
Oh, well, that's good.
thank you.
Dr. Jones... good luck.
now be very careful.
don't trust anybody.
Ah, Venice...
Yes.
uh, how will we recognize this Dr. Schneider when we see him?
I don't know.
maybe he'll know us.
Dr. Jones?
yes?
I knew it was you.
you have your father's eyes.
and my mother's ears, but the rest belongs to you.
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
that's right.
Dr. Elsa Schneider.
Oh, how do you do?
the last time I saw your father, we were in the library.
he was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb.
I've never seen him so excited.
he was as giddy as a schoolboy.
who? Attila the Professor?
he was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy.
will you permit me?
I usually don't.
I usually don't, either.
in that case, I permit you.
it would make me very happy.
but I'm already sad.
by tomorrow, it will have faded.
tomorrow I'll steal you another.
I hate to interrupt you, but the reason we're here...
Yes. I have something to show you.
I left your father working in the library.
he sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city.
when I got back to his table, he'd gone, with all his papers, except for that scrap, which I found near his chair.
Roman numerals.
here is the library.
that doesn't look much like a library.
looks like a converted church.
in this case, it's the literal truth.
we are on holy ground.
these columns over here were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
now, please excuse me.
the library's closing in a few moments.
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
Marcus... I've seen this window before.
where?
right here, in Dad's diary.
you see?
look, lndy.
the Roman numerals.
dad was onto something here.
well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
dad sent me this diary for a reason.
until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
find something?
uh, yes. Three, seven and ten.
that window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
my God, I must be blind.
dad wasn't looking for a book about the knight's tomb, he was looking for the tomb itself.
don't you get it?
the tomb is somewhere in the library.
you said yourself it used to be a church.
look.
three.
three.
seven.
seven. Ten.
and ten.
now where's the ten?
look around for the ten.
three and seven.
seven and seven and ten.
ten.
"X" marks the spot.
bingo.
you don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.
you're a great deal like your father.
except he's lost, and I'm not.
lower me down.
look after this for me, will you?
come on.
pagan symbols.
fourth or fifth century.
right.
600 years before the Crusades.
the Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
that's right.
if there's a knight of the First Crusade down here, that's where we'll find him.
what's this one?
the Ark of the Covenant.
are you sure?
pretty sure.
watch out.
it's petroleum.
I should sink a well down here and retire.
give me the lighter.
Oh, rats.
Ugh!
come on.
come here.
look, it...
it must be one of these.
look at the artistry of these carvings, and the scrollwork.
it's this one.
this is it.
we found it.
look.
the engraving on the shield, it's the same as on the Grail tablet.
the shield is the second marker.
what's that?
it's a rubbing
dad made of the Grail tablet.
just like your father-- giddy as a schoolboy.
wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
he never would have made it past the rats.
he hates rats.
he's scared to death of them.
get back!
back against the wall.
quick! Under it!
air pocket!
don't wander off.
what?
What?!
I think I've found a way out.
deep breath.
Ah, Venice.
Whoa!
are you crazy?! Don't go between them!
go between them? Are you crazy?!
I said go around!
you said go between them!
I said, don't go between them!
No!
why are you trying to kill us?
because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
my father was looking for the Holy Grail.
did you kill him too?
no.
where is he?
talk or you're dead.
damn it, tell me!
tell me!
if you don't let go, Dr. Jones, we'll both die.
then we'll die.
my soul is prepared. How's yours?
this is your last chance.
no, Dr. Jones, it's yours.
all right, where's my father?
if you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
who are you?
my name is Kazim.
and why were you trying to kill me?
the secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years, and for all that time, the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
let me off at this jetty.
ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ?
is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.
in that case, God be with you in your quest.
your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald, on the Austrian-German border.
how's the head?
it's better, now I've seen this.
it's the name of a city.
"Alexandretta"?
Hmm...
the knights of the First Crusade
laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year.
the entire city was destroyed.
the present city of lskenderun is built on its ruins.
Marcus, you remember what the Grail tablet said:
across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
but where exactly?
your father would know.
Mm.
your father did know.
look. He made a map.
he must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail quest.
a map with no names.
now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east, here.
he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains, here.
straight to the canyon.
he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Alexandretta.
now we know.
Yes. Now we know.
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
tell him to meet you in lskenderun.
what about you?
I'm going after Dad.
Oh! Oh...
my room...
mine, too.
what were they looking for?
this.
the Grail diary?
Uh-huh.
you had it?
you didn't trust me.
I didn't know you.
at least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes.
give them a flower, and they'll follow you anywhere.
knock it off. You're not mad.
no?
no. You like the way I do things.
it's lucky I don't do things the same way.
you'd still be standing at the Venice pier!
look, what do you think is going on here?
since I met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait.
we're caught in the middle of something sinister here.
my guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for.
and until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
how dare you kiss me!
leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
and I hate...
arrogant men.
Ah, Venice.
what do you know about this place?
I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
what are you going to do?
don't know.
I'll think of something.
yes?
and not before time!
did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day?
we're drenched!
now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.
are you expected?
do not take that tone with me, my good man.
now butt off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant...
...are here to view the tapestries.
tapestries?
dear me, the man is dense.
this is a castle, isn't it?
there are tapestries?
this is a castle, and we have many tapestries.
but if you are a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse!
how dare he?
Nazis. I hate these guys.
this one. I think he's in here.
how do you know?
because it's wired.
don't worry... this is kid's play.
I'll be right back.
Yes, sir.
it is you, Junior!
don't call me that, please.
well, what are you doing here?
I came to get you. What do you thi...?
late 1 4th century, Ming dynasty.
Oh, it breaks the heart.
and the head. You hit me, Dad.
I'll never forgive myself.
don't worry, I'm fine.
thank God.
it's fake.
see, you can tell by the cross section.
No!
dad, get your stuff.
we've got to get out of here.
well, I'm sorry about your head, though, but I thought you were one of them.
dad, they come in through the doors.
good point.
but better safe than sorry.
hmm, so I was wrong this time.
but, by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my diary.
you obviously got it.
I got it, and I used it.
we found the entrance to the catacombs.
through the library?
right.
I knew it.
and the tomb of Sir Richard?
found it.
he was actually there?
you saw him?
well, what was left of him.
and his shield...
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?
Alexandretta.
Alexandretta! Of course!
on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire.
Oh...
junior, you did it.
no, Dad. You did.
forty years.
Oh, if only I could have been with you.
there were rats, Dad.
rats?
Yeah, big ones.
what do the Nazis want with you, Dad?
they wanted my diary.
yeah?
I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
Yeah.
Dr. Jones.
yes?
I will take the book now.
what book?
you have the diary in your pocket.
you dolt!
do you think my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here?
you didn't, did you?
you didn't bring it, did you?
well, uh...
you did.
look, can we discuss this later?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
will you take it easy?
take it easy?!
why do you think I sent it home in the first place?
so it wouldn't fall into their hands!
I came here to save you!
Oh, yeah?
and who's gonna come to save you, Junior?
I told you...
...don't call me Junior!
look what you did!
I can't believe what you did...
that's far enough. Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.
put down the gun, or the Fraulein dies.
but she's one of them.
Indy, please!
she's a Nazi.
What?!
trust me.
lndy, no! -I will kill her!
yeah? Go ahead!
No! Don't shoot!
don't worry. He won't.
Indy, please! Do what he says!
and don't listen to her.
enough! She dies!
wait! Wait...
I'm sorry.
no, don't be.
but... you should have listened to your father.
she ransacked her own room, and I fell for it.
how did you know she was a Nazi?
hmm?
how did you know she was a Nazi?
she talks in her sleep.
I didn't trust her. Why did you?
because he didn't take my advice.
didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Dr. Jones?
I misjudged you, Walter.
I knew you would sell your mother for an Etruscan vase, but I didn't know you would sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
Dr. Schneider...
there are pages torn out of this.
this book contained a map, a map with no names, precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
so it did.
where are these missing pages, this map?
we must have these pages back.
you're wasting your breath.
he won't tell us, and he doesn't have to.
it's perfectly obvious where the pages are.
he's given them to Marcus Brody.
you didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you?
he's not up to the challenge.
he sticks out like a sore thumb.
we'll find him.
the hell you will.
he's got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs.
Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan.
he speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom.
he'll blend in, disappear.
you'll never see him again.
with any luck, he's got the Grail already.
does anyone here speak English?
or even ancient Greek?
uh, water? No, thank you, sir.
no. Fish make love in it.
goodness me.
thank you so much.
no, I don't like that.
no, I really don't want...
no, no, thank you very much.
no, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.
does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?
Mr. Brody!
Oh, Sallah. What a relief.
Marcus Brody, sir.
but where is lndy?
Oh, he's in Austria.
a slight detour.
you are on your own?
Yes, but don't panic.
everything's under control.
have you, have you arranged our supplies?
Oh, yes, of course.
but where are we going?
Oh, this map will show you.
it was drawn by, uh, Mr. Brody.
welcome to lskenderun.
the director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.
Oh, well... your servant, sir.
and I am his.
follow me, please.
my reputation precedes me.
there is no museum in lskenderun.
papers, please.
papers?
of course.
run.
Yes.
papers. Got it here.
just finished reading it myself.
run.
Yes.
"Egyptian Mail," morning edition.
run.
did you say, uh...
run!
okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!
find the back door! Find the back door!
intolerable.
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.
you must return immediately.
a rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
so?
your presence on the platform is requested at the highest level.
thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at lskenderun.
take this diary to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.
it will show them our progress, ahead of schedule.
without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.
let me kill them now.
no.
if we fail to recover the pages from Brody, we'll need them alive.
always do what the doctor orders.
don't look at me like that.
we both wanted the Grail.
I would have done anything to get it.
you would have done the same.
I'm sorry you think so.
I can't forget how wonderful it was.
thank you.
it was rather wonderful.
Oh, Dr. Schneider.
your car is waiting.
that's how Austrians say good-bye.
and this is how we say good-bye in Germany, Dr. Jones.
Oh!
I liked the Austrian way better.
so did l.
let's try and get these ropes loose.
we've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do.
you said he had two days' start.
that he would blend in. Disappear.
are you kidding? I made that up.
you know Marcus.
he got lost once in his own museum.
Oh...
can you try and reach my left jacket pocket?
what am I looking for?
my lucky charm.
feels like a cigarette lighter.
try and burn through the ropes.
very good.
Oh!
I ought to tell you something.
don't get sentimental now, dad.
save it till we get out of here.
the floor's on fire.
see? -What?
and the chair.
move! Move it out of here!
go!
it's scorching the table! Fast!
move! -Okay!
well, we have Marcus Brody, but more important, we have the map.
by the personal command of the Fuhrer.
secrecy essential to success.
eliminate the American conspirators.
germany has declared war on the Jones boys.
dad! -What?
dad!
what?
dad! -What?
head for the fireplace!
Oh.
I think I can get these ropes off.
Whoops.
our situation has not improved.
listen, Dad, I'm almost free.
alarm!
this is intolerable.
I'm out, Dad.
well done, boy.
come on, Dad.
dead end.
there's got to be a...
a secret door or a...
passageway or something.
I find that if I just sit down and think...
dad!
...the solution presents itself.
great. More boats.
you say this has been just another typical day for you, huh?
No! But better than most.
come on, Dad. Come on.
what about the boat?
since the dawn of time...
storytellers have enchanted audiences with their words.
but there is an even rarer gift;
there are those, who by reading out loud...
can bring characters to life.
out of books and into our world.
go to sleep now, go to sleep, baby girl.
maybe this will work. Let me read to her.
she's too young.
no.
why don't you read to me?
once upon a time, there was a dear little girl. . .
who was loved by everyone who met her. . .
but especially by her grandmother,
who would've given her anything.
once she gave her a little hood of red velvet. "
what was that?
what?
I don't know. Nothing.
red velvet that suited her so well. . .
that she refused to wear anything instead of it.
so she was called little red riding hood. "
most of these silvertongues, as they are known...
prefer to keep their skills a secret.
but some do not even know that this gift is theirs...
...until it is too late.
is this the right way?
next turn on the left.
are you sure? because I think we missed it.
who's the driver? Dad.
who's the navigator? Me.
have I ever got us lost before? - No.
no.
Oh, hey. Look, a sasquatch.
Hey! Oh, the turning, left, left, left!
the alpine antiquarian bookshop should be
at the end of this street. . .
and on the right-hand side of the square.
good.
by the way, how come every bookshop we go to
is a thousand years old?
why can't we go to one. . .
that sells hot chocolate and books that are actually new?
what good would a bookbinder like me be in a new bookstore?
I love old books, the marbled pages
end papers, the leather binding.
this is my kind of place.
maybe you'll find it here, mo. - Find what?
that book you're always looking for.
I'm not looking for anything particular.
you don't think I've noticed?
you never leave a bookshop unless you've checked every corner, every shelf.
don't we? - No, you always come away disappointed.
sometimes your eyes are even a little red.
it's because old books are dusty.
Hey, look, Harriet The Spy.
I'm going inside. You want to come?
the Secret Garden! - Or I guess you could stay here.
afternoon. I'm Mortimer Folchart.
the famous book doctor.
well, you're just in time.
look at this poor patient.
do you think we can save him?
I think the prognosis is good. - Excellent.
quite the collection you have. - Yes.
if you'd like to look around, be my guest. - Thank you.
fine, intelligent eye.
what do you say to calling him black beauty?
Oh, my dear child.
imagine, Heidi.
Capricorn's men were looking for Dustfinger in the wrong place.
southwest end of treasure island.
he hadn't left the village.
he hadn't even tried.
Dustfinger was in Basta's house.
what is that? coming over the hill?
it's a beast of some kind!
Dustfinger.
he doesn't like to be tickled.
and you should be more careful.
his name's Gwin.
and I know he looks charming. . .
but you know what they say about books and covers.
uh. . . Yeah, I do.
I also know what they say about
talking to strangers. Excuse me.
but I'm not a stranger, Meggie.
you won't remember me, we only met once,
and you were quite small.
but I'm no stranger.
Hello, silvertongue.
I was just having a talk with your daughter.
Meggie, go wait for me in the van.
it's all right, he's a friend.
dad. - Do it now!
let's you and me go for a little walk.
I've been looking for you.
I've been one step behind you for years.
waiting for you to find what it is you've been searching for.
just tell me what you want.
I want you to put right the wrong you did nine years ago.
and I'm here to warn you,
Capricorn knows where you're staying.
his men are there now
waiting for you and your daughter to come home.
he wants you to read for him. - Well, he's out of luck.
I don't read aloud anymore.
if he finds you, you really think you'll have a choice?
I could help you stay hidden, but I won't.
not unless you promise to send me home.
I've been here too long.
send me home, silvertongue.
read to me. - I'm sorry, I can't help you.
it's too dangerous. It's uncontrollable.
if you won't help me, I'll find someone who can.
just give me the book.
what book? I don't have the book.
you don't have the book? - No.
I've searched everywhere. I don't have it.
what's in the bag?
did you finally find one?
it's funny, isn't it?
strange, my turning up here right at that very moment.
you know, there are times in life
when the stars just simply align.
but this is not one of those times!
dad!
Meggie! - What's happening?
I told you to stay in the van! run!
get in, get in!
come on. Start!
stop! I'm trying to help you!
what are you doing? leave it alone.
I want to see the book!
you're not to touch that book, understand?
I don't understand. I don't understand at all.
what is that book?
why did the freaky man with the scars want it?
why did he call you silvertongue? - I can't tell you.
you have to tell me. - No. I have to protect you.
and your mother.
my mother? What has this got to do with my mother?
Meggie, please just. . . .
I'm scared, Mo.
Meggie, I'm going to take care of you.
I always have, and I always will.
at least tell me where we're going.
we're going to Italy.
you have a great aunt there.
it's very important that we get there, okay?
please, Meggie, no more questions.
so she's friendly, this great aunt of mine?
you'll like her.
would you please stop ringing that damn bell!
after a while. She's kind of an acquired taste.
right.
what?
Elinor.
well, for the love of Thomas Hardy.
I'm so glad you've finally
made your way back here, Mortimer.
my poor books are in a terrible state of disrepair.
don't worry. I'll take care of it.
don't play with your food, child. you're not a toddler.
look at her, she's as thin as a soap bubbie.
Oh, she so reminds me of her mother.
not just when she opens her mouth,
if she ever does, speaking of
we haven't heard from her, if that's what you mean.
Oh, well, no matter.
I grew up without a mother.
didn't do me any damage whatsoever.
my mother just suddenly dashed off on safari
one day and never came back.
it's what the women in our family seem to do,
they just go off on adventures.
not me, I prefer to stay where I am.
but your mother. . .
well, she wanted the real thing.
my mum wanted me.
and then one day she was gone, without explanation.
is that what you call an adventure?
no, that's what I call abandonment.
well done, Elinor.
Oh, well, you know it's the truth.
mum did not abandon us.
no. no, she didn't.
well, then what really happened to her?
I'm not a child anymore. I'm all grown up.
almost.
enough to know the most important thing.
that's ever happened to me.
don't you think I've realized why I'm not in regular school like other kid?
and why we're always travelling around from place to place?
all these years you've been looking for mum.
and that book,
but I just don't understand how those two things. . .
meggie
you have to tell me something.
I write about her sometimes. - You do?
Yeah. I make up stories about
you make up stories?
Meggie, you know I don't want you doing that.
but I have to.
I feel like the words bring her back to me.
Yeah.
the written word.
it's a powerful thing.
you have to be careful with it.
do you think we'll ever see her again?
I hope we do, Meggie.
I hope we do.
step away from that case! three steps back!
what are you doing? This place is not for children.
I thought I made that clear. Come on, out.
I'm sorry, I was just looking for a book to read.
is that a nose print?
do you have any idea how valuable this manuscript is?
Yes, I know.
Oh, you know, do you?
it's Persian, isn't it?
I can tell from the illuminations. . .
the pinks and the blues and the gold-patterned background.
maybe from the late 12th century or so?
goodness me, what a little know-it-all.
it's beautiful.
Yes, it is, isn't it? but I just adore everything Persian.
you've been to Persia, then? - Yes, a hundred times.
along with St. Petersburg,
Paris, Middle Earth, distant planets and Shangri-La.
and I never had to leave this room.
books are adventure.
they contain murder and mayhem and passion.
they love anyone who opens them.
if I promise not to touch anything. . .
could I maybe just sit and read in here for a while?
that was the window seat where she used to curl up and read.
she?
your mother.
your father used to read to her here.
this was hers.
if I find even a bookmark out of place
I'll lock this room up. . .
and you'll never see the inside of it again
that I can promise you.
then Dorian Gray half opened the door.
as he did so...
farewell...
trapped inside...
desire of revenge...
I tried to warn you.
I gave you every opportunity to help me
but you refused.
all you had to do was read me back.
you could have kept the book.
but you had to run.
so I turned to Capricorn.
what? - He's promised to help me.
what have you done?
Meggie!
there are men outside!
they're trying to break into the house!
Meggie!
Mo, look out!
Mortimer, my books!
Hello, silvertongue.
Basta? - Did you miss me?
stop!
Oh, you literate cretins! - Hold him!
these are masterpieces you're destroying!
masterpieces, you ignorant halfwit!
stop! I swear, I'll kill every last one of you!
you know I could!
it would take a few words!
Oh, we won't have to worry about your words If we cut out your tongue!
you remember my calling card, don't you?
one, two, three!
if that doesn't work. . .
well, there's always your daughter.
get off me! - No one gets hurt.
Yes, the fire! the fire.
isn't that what we agreed?
isn't that what we agreed?
Yes, we agreed, we agreed, we agreed!
evil spirits, I repel thee. Evil spirits, I repel thee!
dad! Dad!
right, get them in the van.
you're not taking them too. - Capricorn's orders.
after all, we are going to require a little leverage. . .
to make daddy read.
Meggie!
don't drag my daughter into this.
for god's sakes, she's just a child.
no, don't! no! - What's this?
no. - My only hope of finding my wife.
my only hope of going home! - No!
what is it? When will you tell me what is going on?
has your father ever read you a bedtime story, Meggie?
you might want to ask him why. - Give me this.
I'll take that!
No!
Oh, my books! No!
come along, now. Hurry up.
Oh, my books!
come on!
Meggie.
where are we?
they're here.
Hey, they're coming!
Oh, how lovely.
after you.
come on, out! out!
Oh, they're rude!
move! move!
it's ticking.
flying monkeys.
what is this place? - I don't know.
welcome to our humble abode.
enjoy your stay. - Go on!
no, I will not share this filthy hovel with all those creatures!
go on, get in!
in you go!
what are we doing here, Mortimer?
where did those monsters come from?
books.
they came out of books.
what are you talking about?
Mortimer, be quick, be clear
or I swear I'll disinherit you.
came out of books? What do you mean?
come here.
Meggie. . .
this is the story you have been waiting to hear.
Elinor, you were away at a book fair. . .
and we were housesitting for you. Me, Meggie, your mum.
and that night we were in the library...
so I opened a copy of a book we'd just bought.
Inkheart.
Inkheart.
it was a good read. Full of adventure and magic...
and a creature called the Shadow, terrifying.
I read several chapters aloud and nothing happened.
then they appeared, out of nowhere...
from the medieval world of the book.
at first it was Capricorn...
a thuggish bandit working for an evil duke.
then Basta, his knife-wielding sidekick.
and then Dustfinger...
a traveling fire juggler with magical powers.
my voice brought them out.
your voice brought them out of the book?
and her mother went in.
that's how it works.
Dustfinger saved us from Capricorn that night.
it was only then that I realized...
Resa, your mum...
she was gone.
they'd come out of the book, and she went into it.
Resa!
and that, Meggie, was the last time that I read to you.
the night we lost your mother.
Oh, she went into the book.
Oh. Goodness sake, Mortimer!
all these years you've allowed me
to think the worst of Resa!
why didn't you tell us?
would you have believed me?
you want to read mum back out of the book.
that's why you've been searching for Inkheart all these years.
if she's alive, you mean.
you say she's trapped in that book. How do you know?
who's to say she got there? If she did. . .
how could she survive for nine years
if the monsters are anything like those?
or worse.
how do you know where she is? or if she's alive, even.
how do you know?
it's like the illustration in the book. - Kind of scary.
it's hideous. The man's got no taste whatsoever.
look, will you stop pushing me!
Meggie, just pretend that you're in a book.
children always escape in books.
no, they don't.
remember the little match girl?
they found her in an alley frozen to death.
walk.
come in.
we saved you the good seats.
Capricorn.
uh! I told you to stop that!
please.
you got old.
you got a castle.
indeed, I did. - And a haircut.
a lovely castle in a secluded part of the country. . .
. . . far from prying eyes.
Oh, yes, I've adjusted rather well to your world,
don't you think?
this must be your daughter, so much life to live.
you, however, are a noisy old bag.
you make a racket without opening your mouth.
you barbaric piece of pulp fiction!
your malice is matched by your stupidity!
I don't know how things are in that third-rate novel of yours. . .
but where I come from
one does not go around ravaging libraries!
my life's work,
destroyed by a bunch of unread, solecistic thugs!
I have no patience for old women with big mouths.
you know my reader.
darius, why don't we show our guests
what I have been up against?
read that.
but you said. . .
I wouldn't have to read once he got here.
Yes, well, I lied, didn't I, when I said that?
read the book.
"Rapunzel had splendid long hair.
it was as fine as spun gold.
and when she heard-- "
help! No!
help!
you see?
look at the writing on her face.
she's only been half read out of the book.
take her to the dungeon. - No!
and give her a haircut. - No!
I'm not going to read out loud, if that's what you're intending.
not with them in the room. - Bring the girl up, please.
you take your
you'll do exactly what I tell you to do. . .
or I'll kill the old lady
and lock your daughter up for eternity.
is that clear?
great. well, let's get things started, shall we?
this is a great book, filled with riches.
reading out treasure?
for now.
someone has to pay for repairs,
and all the locals have been bled dry.
I'm warning you. I have no control over what comes and goes.
I have no idea what's going to happen.
well, this should be fun, then. Let's give it a whirl.
"Kasim gazed upon the treasures within the cave.
mountains of gold and silver were heaped from floor to celling.
piles of silks and sacks of jewels.
kasim gathered all the treasure he could carry. . .
. . . only to find the door of the cave sealed shut.
and by the will of Allah. . .
he'd forgotten the password.
he cried out, 'Open barley!'
but the door did not budge.
kasim named every grain of wheat he could think of.
open buckwheat!' 'Open millet!'
but still the door would not open.
then came the sound of approaching hooves. "
sand.
"Kasim ran to hide, but tripped,
sending coins spilling in every direction.
then came the muffled call of 'open sesame!'
and the cave opened. . .
. . . to reveal a most unpleasant collection. . .
. . . of bandits. "
what?
you see?
Yes! yes!
that's how it's done!
look! What'd I tell you?
put that boy in the stable
and feed him to the ticking crocodile.
but if he came out, who went in?
help.
help.
it's my turn now.
it's my turn now.
just like you promised.
your turn?
Oh, you mean this.
it's an incredibly rare book, this.
we've been tracking them down for years.
I can't send you back. I don't know how.
send us back?
why would we ever want to go back. . .
. . . when your world is so accommodating?
with your telephones and your guns and. . . .
what's that sticky stuff called?
duct tape. - Yes, duct tape.
I love duct tape.
besides, what was I in Inkheart?
the Adderhead's henchman.
living in the woods with all those filthy beasts.
but look at me now.
I've got a castle.
I'll never go back. None of us ever will.
to make sure of that, I'm going to do what I always do. . .
. . . when someone digs up a copy of this tedious book.
you promised I'd be sent home.
Yes, I know. I lied when I said that.
I mean, I'm a liar. I lie all the time. Lie, lie, lie.
after all these years, you'd think he'd figure it out by now.
No! - No!
get it! get it out!
No!
must you do that every single time? It's pathetic, honestly.
don't!
now, get your burns tended to.
otherwise, I'll be forced to cancel our juggle night.
you know how much I look forward to juggle night. Lock them up.
Hey, Darius. don't forget to feed the crocodile, will you?
Oh, for the love of Theseus!
no, no, no. He didn't mean it.
he's just hungry. It's not his fault.
he's a minotaur.
he can barely walk, thanks to Darius and his reading.
a lot is down to this jackass.
we came out with half the book
tattooed across our face. Look at my eye.
if you think that's bad, look at the state of my nose.
it's disgusting. -Ye-- all right.
so you can imagine how pleased we are that you're here.
delighted. Because now we got someone who can really read.
I hurt myself.
again.
I don't understand it.
in Inkheart, my hands, they never burned.
but here. . . !
fire has no sense of humor.
you're trying to escape again?
Resa. . .
. . . give up.
we're not going anywhere.
for a moment. . .
. . . I held Inkheart in my hands.
but it's ashes now.
and I shall never go home.
but you. . .
. . . you still have hope.
when Darius read you out of inkworld,
he left your voice behind in that book.
but if you could talk. . .
. . . would you tell me your story?
would you?
no.
no, you wouldn't. it's because of how I'm written, isn't it?
you think me weak and deceitful.
it's not all I am.
not all of me.
it's just a dream.
it's just a dream. It's just a dream.
are you all right?
what's your name? - My name is Farid.
are you one of the 40 thieves? - Stop talking to me.
don't you know it's bad luck to speak in a dream?
you stupid girl.
you talk in a dream, you never find your way back.
"stupid " ?
you're the one who thinks you're in a dream.
I was just trying to be nice.
go back to your muttering and see if I care.
it's just a dream, just a dream.
come home.
please come home.
good morning.
thank you.
how can I ever repay you?
Resa, even if I could find you a key, where would you go?
this is your family?
this is your husband?
your daughter?
you went in the book when I came out.
you went in the book. . .
. . . when I came out. . .
. . . and then Darius read you out again.
Gwin.
I'm gonna get you out of these chains,
and then you're going home.
I'll meet you at the stables.
I've never been that in control before.
I know I can get Resa out of the book.
and maybe send Capricorn back in.
we just have to find another copy.
well, it only took you nine years to find the last one.
I bet the author has a copy.
if he's alive, I bet he'd have one.
someone must know where he lives.
great. now we're going to have to try to escape, aren't we?
either that, or get fed to the ticking crocodile next door.
someone has to stop him.
before you say anything, I'm here to save your necks.
after putting them on the chopping block in the first place?
listen, you want your wife back as much as I want to go home to my family.
you think there's another copy of Inkheart out there,
let's find it together.
and how do you intend that we escape?
page 1 4.
the mighty storm?
get in the castle! let's go!
"from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind...
...and uncle Henry and Dorothy could see...
where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm.
there's a cyclone coming, Em. I'll go after the stock. "
good doggies.
"Suddenly, uncle Henry stood up. "
get out of the square!
"he ran toward the sheds where the cows and the horses were kept.
aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.
one glance told her of the danger close at hand.
quick, Dorothy! Run for the cellar! "
there she is! Come on!
"a strange thing happened.
the house whirled around two or three
times and rose slowly through the air.
Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon. "
that should do it!
let's get out of here!
must've run off!
help me!
come here! Let's go.
come on! Straight on!
come on! get them!
come on, get up!
you were right.
Gwin! - Meggie!
Meggie!
don't move!
watch out!
Dustfinger!
where are we going?
don't leave me!
the prisoners!
they're escaping!
run!
hurry, get in! run, run!
get in, get in!
get the keys, hurry up! take all the keys!
which one? the one with the nine!
wait, wait, wait, Gwin!
come on, Gwin.
come on! Okay, go, go!
hold on!
watch out!
still think you're dreaming?
well, what else could it be?
we're flying.
or is it the night flying past us?
he lives in Alassio.
which way is that?
South. - South?
can't you be more precise?
beats a camel, huh?
Farid.
Oh, hooligan.
farid, some clothes for you. you'll freeze to death otherwise.
apparently this is the place.
man in the fishmonger's says
he lives in an apartment over the square.
good. Great.
Oh, I'm not coming.
what do you mean? you have to come, otherwise he won't believe me.
Oh, I don't know. you can be pretty persuasive.
you talked me out of a book.
the book is right here within our grasp
you're afraid.
you've never read Inkheart, have you?
what's there to read?
I've lived it. Except for the end, and I've got no interest in that.
well, why not?
do you know the end of your story, Meggie?
no. And I suspect you wouldn't want to.
it'd be like turning to the last page of a mystery.
Where's the fun in that?
well, I think I know the end of my story.
Hm? - I'm going home.
Why?
I'm sorry. It's just all too real for me.
I prefer a story that has the good sense to stay on the page where it belongs.
no, I have to get back to my poor, desecrated books.
I want to mend them, put them in order.
I'll do that. Let me-- - Here's some money for you.
you see, I've already bought my ticket.
goodbye.
good luck.
Elinor-- - Let her go.
don't catch cold.
Bye, then.
here it is. This must be it.
that's it.
what? Oh.
Signor Fenogilo? - Yes?
sir, my name's Mortimer Folchart.
I'm Meggie. - My daughter.
l want to be a writer too. - You do?
Yes. Give me something to write with.
be quick, I've got a cake in the oven.
don't just stand there like you've been taxidermied.
if you want an autograph, give me a pen. - We don't want one.
you don't want an autograph? - No.
then why in the name of Chaucer's beard are you ringing?
Dustfinger's in the piazza,
we just escaped from Capricorn's village. . .
and you won't even believe what Basta tried to do.
what?
come home.
please, come home.
a good story, I'll give you that.
Silvertongues is a wonderful concept. Wish I thought of it.
too absurd to take seriously.
I know my characters are so believable that they seem to leap off the page.
but it's simply not possible.
exactly as I imagined him.
this must be what it feels like to give birth.
wait, where you going? He doesn't want to meet.
of course he does. I'm practically his father.
well, what was that at the end?
it's called dragon's breath.
you can teach to me?
I'm sure that this must be very exciting for you to meet your characters.
but the purpose that we came here was to find a way. . .
. . . to get him back in the book.
your father's given me an idea for a character.
a master thief who steals things. . .
. . . the way a blue jay swipes shiny objects off windowsill.
I am not trying to steal your character.
you snatched them. You're trying to keep them from me.
that, my friend, is thievery.
I'm just trying to get my wife back.
Dustfinger.
so wonderful to meet you. - Oh, no, no. no.
the scars are perfect, as hideous as I imagined.
I told you, he's afraid. But, oh, not me, I hope.
he's afraid of what happens at the end of the book.
what do you mean? Because he dies?
Oh, no.
Oh, I see. right, I'm sorry. - He dies in the end?
I had to make the story exciting, it's my job.
they can't all have happy endings.
life doesn't always, after all.
how's it happen?
you're killed by one of Capricorn's men while trying to save Gwin.
it's a very touching death scene. I cried when I wrote it.
you think I care what you wrote?
you don't control my fate. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
I'm not just some character in your book. . .
and you. . .
. . . you're not my god.
now, listen, old man. . .
do you have a copy of the book or don't you?
because I would like to go home now, please.
the problem is it's been out of print for decades.
Plus, the original print run was quite small.
then there was the fire in the warehouse. . .
and the publishers went out of business.
this is gonna take forever.
stop it. This is no time to act foolishly.
stop it. - You're as sour as goat's urine.
Thanks, and I don't want to know how you know that.
look around. This garden is paradise.
no slave drivers. No sandstorms.
no fleas. - No peace and quiet.
no, it's not that one either.
I did hold on to a few copies. . .
but I loaned them to a book exhibition in Genoa a few years ago
and they were stolen.
I suppose Capricorn was behind the theft.
at the time I assumed it was just bad luck.
Ah! here we are. - What is it?
the original manuscript. Look at that!
TYPEWRITTEN, can you imagine?
Grabbies.
after all these years, I still remember the characters.
the water nymphs in the wayless wood.
and in the castles of umbra the black prince.
the motley folk.
and of course you, Dustfinger.
as well as the villains;
the Adderhead, Capricorn and the fire raisers.
and the worst of all, the Shadow.
it's a wonderful book, I must say.
I'd give anything to go into it myself.
well, get in line, old man.
I've got page 29 to 44. What do you got?
I have the rest.
all right. need that.
now you can read me back, right?
well, I'll try to.
but that's only after I've read my wife out, and she's all right.
it's the only way I'm gonna do it.
we might have a problem. - What are you talking about?
you can't read her out.
Why?
because she's not in the book.
what are you not telling me? - I've seen her.
she's not actually in the book anymore.
she's. . . . - Where?
she's in Capricorn's village. Darius read her out.
she's alive?
we were just there and you didn't tell me!
we need the book. - We didn't need the book!
I needed the book!
my mum was there and you didn't tell us?
listen. . . . Yeah, don't look at me like that. . .
because if your dad knew the truth, he wouldn't have helped me
and I need the book.
selfish, repugnant, weak character!
blame him, he wrote me that way.
I disagree. - You tell me how to find her!
not until you promise to read me back.
tell me how to find my wife. - I miss my family too.
all right.
promise.
I promise.
I want to help save mum too.
take me with you. - You know I can't do that.
but I can help.
you can help by staying here and being safe.
that's what you can do.
you don't know what I can do.
and neither do I.
Meggie, will you please--?
okay, come on. you got to stay here.
thanks very much. Take care of Meggie. - Yes.
and Farid as well. - What?
take care of Farid as well. - Of course.
why can't I come too? It's my car.
sweetheart.
just bring her back.
I will.
reduced to babysitting, marvelous.
hurry up, we'll miss the train. how long will it take to get there?
not very long. Come on.
can I sit next to you, mum? - Me too.
I'll sit in the middle.
"that just happened, " said Dorothy, simply.
"I could not help it. "
you have no right to...
"if you wish me to use my magic powers to send you home...
you must do something for me first.
help me and I will help you. "
"what must I do? " said the girl.
"kill the wicked witch of the west. "
"from the far north they heard a low wall of the wind. . .
and uncle Henry and Dorothy
could see where the long grass bowed before the coming storm. "
it was Toto that made Dorothy laugh.
he was a little black dog with long silky hair. . .
and small black eyes that twinkled merrily. . .
on either side of his funny wee nose. "
toto? Oh, Toto, don't be scared.
you're just not in Kansas anymore.
Oh, Toto.
toto, come out from under there.
you're gonna get me in trouble.
it's me, open the door.
just a minute.
and not another sound. I mean it.
I'm sorry, I had no choice.
but, look, it's Basta.
and I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid all the henchmen blend into one, even to me.
Hello, princess. Where's your father?
told him he'd gone, but they don't believe me.
you told them? - He held a knife to my throat.
isn't he awful? And they don't believe I'm the author.
tell us where silvertongue is before I kill you both.
toto, no!
toto?
Oh, my goodness!
she's inherited her father's gift.
another silvertongue.
old Capricorn will be pleased.
bring them both.
so if Darius read her out of the book. . . .
Oh, no, no, no. she's fine.
mostly, she-- - Mostly?
she's got no voice.
what? - He read her out last spring. . .
and she has no voice.
but apart from that, she's fine.
pull over. - For what?
just pull over. - That makes sense, you speaking weasel.
I thought I told you to stay with the old man.
but he's mean.
not as mean as Capricorn.
he doesn't scare me. I was raised by murderers and thieves.
well, he should scare you.
I should make you walk back. - I'd only follow you.
get in.
after this, you teach me dragon's breath
just get in the car.
Hello, Mr. Fenoglio?
these guys are just circling the perimeter.
we should move in now.
when we get to maid's quarters. . .
Resa's room is the third door on the right when we go in back.
I'll go in the back. You guys cover me.
all right, this is our way in.
now, listen, this is going to be dangerous so you need to keep up.
got to move quickly.
after you.
shall we rest?
no, that's okay. Just keep moving.
kids. - No, I'm fine.
what was that? - Where?
there!
over there! - Shoot him!
bring him down! - Thanks.
they're there behind the square. Oh, no.
well, come on. Quick.
Hurry! go on! - Head him off at the square!
don't let him get away!
look. Look at this. Look at the dragon's breath.
I think I got it. here, feel my hand.
it's been too long. I'm going to see if he's all right.
come on. We'll find him.
he's not far away.
well done. Thank you. - My pleasure.
look who's back. This is nice.
just in time for your execution.
all right.
Capricorn's castle is like a five-star hotel.
not for you, obviously. You'll be locked in the crypt.
but some of our guests get a room with a view.
Resa.
sorry.
listen, your husband's here.
he's come to rescue you.
that way! that way!
there!
come on!
what happened?
they're going to kill Dustfinger.
here. They're going to kill him, it's my fault.
no, it's not. What happened?
all the letters of the alphabet.
it looks just like my book.
it's like walking into my own imagination.
I wonder what Capricorn's going to make you read.
I hope it's something good.
I'm excited, I am. are you, eh?
what raft, Jim? - Our old raft. '
you mean to say our old raft wasn't smashed all to flinders?
I'm convinced.
though I don't know what that poor boy will do without his raft.
no. I'm tired of doing stupid tricks for you.
tell me where my father is.
I have absolutely no idea.
quite frankly, I don't care,
because you read just as well as he does.
what are you gawking at?
you're just as I wrote you.
a cowardly thug.
how dare you.
you'll pay for your filthy story!
only the king can pull it out.
don't you remember?
don't you ever laugh at me.
get it away from me. I want it executed with the others.
the dog? You want the dog executed?
as for you, we'll see how you enamored of your creations you are when the Shadow is flaying the skin off your back.
you can't bring it out of the book. you burnt the last copy.
I saw you do it.
wrong.
I saved a copy of the book for myself.
aren't I full of surprises?
no, I couldn't burn them all, could I?
not with my old friend trapped inside.
Oh, you are going to love him.
and by love, I mean cower in terror from.
you see, I love this world. . .
and I intend to write my name on every page of it.
you. . .
and the Shadow are going to help me do just that.
I won't read anything for you.
Oh, really?
let me show you what happens to those who disobey me around here.
she's been very naughty, this one.
tiresome in the extreme.
always trying to escape.
so I'm putting an end to it.
Meggie. - Mum.
it's you.
mum's here. We're going to get out. We're going to escape.
we'll all escape.
what a touching display of empathy.
'Mum. "
look at me.
Yes, I can see the resemblance.
do you still think I can't convince you to read for me?
No! mum! mum!
please! please!
Meggie!
is it too late to make any changes?
changes?
thinking perhaps you might be able to add a few lines,
you know what I mean?
I don't need to be some great beauty, or anything.
I don't know if you noticed my nose.
Oh, your nose. Yes, right.
think you could do that? Rewrite things, change things a bit.
I don't know. It's a wonderful idea.
move.
what are you doing? Get off me. - You can't go down there.
they have my daughter. - They'll kill her if you do anything.
I should never have left her alone. - We have to stay hidden.
nothing to be frightened of. It's just dusty old coffins.
if there are any nasty spirits down here, it's not us they're angry at.
princess needs to rest that voice of hers for tonight.
I've seen my mum. She's a prisoner here.
I know.
have you seen my dad?
Yeah, he's fine.
Capricorn's got another copy of the book.
he's gonna make me read the Shadow out of it.
I have dad's gift.
I can do it.
well, then you could read me back.
"one moonlit night. . .
the Shadow turned on his despicable. . . . "
make him kill Capricorn.
make the Shadow do it.
food for the little princess.
Capricorn wants you to have your strength for tonight.
you should stay. We're telling ghost stories.
right. you don't like ghost stories, do you?
I'll give you ghost stories, you!
get it off of me!
my pouch!
you don't have your good luck charm.
give me that back!
why don't you come in and get it?
what are you doing?
someone's got to get us out, and I don't think it'll be the writer.
you give that back to me.
you be careful.
maybe I don't need my good luck.
time to finish what we started.
by the bones of the dead man in this coffin, I curse you.
don't you say that. Take that back!
may his spirit haunt your every step.
you take that back!
open this gate. Hurry up. Quickly.
open the gate. - Come on.
let me out.
which one? - Help! The prisoners are escaping!
the fire! Use your fire!
come on, hurry up.
help! The prisoners are escaping!
the prisoners are escaping!
come on!
come on.
the prisoners are escaping! Help!
help! Quick!
I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't, I'm sorry. - Stay!
don't go.
you don't have to be selfish just because that's how I wrote you!
you're more than that! You said so yourself!
stay and help us!
help!
the prisoners are escaping! Help!
check all the courtyards!
let me out!
don't leave! Come back!
Oh, God.
this is quite possibly the most stupid thing you've ever done in your life, Elinor.
there are a bunch of murderous thugs up there.
you think you're going to just walk in and tell them what to do?
very likely to listen to you, aren't they?
silly old bookworm with your head in the clouds.
thank you. - You're alive.
thank you.
all right. All right. All right, that's enough.
did you find them? Resa, Meggie, how are they?
they're fine. - Good.
for now.
but Capricorn has a copy of the book. - He what?
he kept one secretly.
that was always his plan, to have the Shadow read out of the book.
I can't read the Shadow out. That would kill us all.
he doesn't need you anymore.
he found someone else.
Meggie.
Meggie?
having writer's block?
maybe I can help.
Yeah, that's right. You want to be a writer, don't you?
you say that as if it's a bad thing. - No, no. Just a lonely thing.
the world you create on the page. . .
seems more friendly and alive than the world you live in.
and you wish you could be there instead.
you're a clever girl, Meggie.
I couldn't have hoped for a finer
young lady to be shut up in a crypt with. . .
whilst awaiting my execution.
now, I haven't really got what I need yet. . .
but it's very close.
come on, feed us.
blast, they're early. Why are they early? This is most inconvenient.
put one here somewhere.
the words have to be perfect or it won't work.
they have to be written by the writer. It has to sound like Inkheart.
Ah. Here it is.
here what is?
something for her to remember me by after I'm gone.
I don't think much of your crude scribblings, old man.
well, you are my crude scribblings, Magpie. . .
so I'd be careful what I scrumple up if I were you.
where are you taking her? - To put on her party frock.
Oh, Don't worry, you're invited to the feast as well.
we wouldn't eat without you. In fact, you're the main course.
the Shadow will be feeding on you and that maid later tonight. . .
so rest assured somebody will be back to fetch you.
you wanted to be alone, didn't you? Well, here you are.
alone in the wilderness.
mosquito bites and blisters and
Oh, god.
and do you have a plan? - No, no plan.
just rent a motorbike, find a map.
we'll figure it out when we get there.
this is the plan. - Good.
you use your fire and create a distraction.
I can set fire to the castle.
I can help too.
don't get in my way.
when Capricorn's men try to put the fire out. . .
I move in, I rescue Meggie and Resa. - But we're outnumbered.
and they have these. . . . - Guns.
that's why we disguise ourselves as black jackets. Let's go.
well, come on, then.
this really is a beautiful little village.
but it'll be nice to have something a bit bigger.
stretch out.
expand my kingdom's borders.
that's why I need the Shadow.
and I don't want anyone else escaping.
if you don't stop shaking, I'm going to stick you with a pin.
do you honestly expect me to read an entire army out of this book?
do you have a better idea? - No.
thought not.
get a move on.
go on.
come on! Come on!
go on.
forward.
don't try anything funny or you'll never see your mother alive again.
please.
the time has come to be reunited with our old friend!
well, tie them up, then.
good evening.
do you want to get out of here?
then you're going to have to help me.
Inkheart! Inkheart! Inkheart!
read it!
read the words!
Inkheart!
say the words!
you're very good at that.
doesn't mean we're friends or anything.
read it! Read it!
Inkheart!
read it!
I got it. Here.
Capricorn led an army of brutal men. . .
who struck fear in the hearts and minds of all those they came in contact with.
whenever they passed by... - Resa.
people closed their doors and hid with their children.
but of all the villains lurking in the wayless wood. . .
the one most feared and reviled was known simply as the Shadow.
the Shadow.
made from the ashes of Capricorn's victims. . .
. . . the Shadow was immortal and invulnerable. . .
. . . and as pitiless as his master.
his fingers and even his breath brought death. . .
scenting his way like a hound on the trail.
he appears only when Capricorn calls him. . .
rising from the ground, a faceless and fiery beast.
no. Stop reading. Stop. - Eager to consume his next victim.
stop reading, Meggie.
Meggie, stop reading!
beautiful.
feast.
mum!
shadow!
shadow! Toto! good boy.
mum!
feast.
yet one starlit night
the Shadow heard a different voice.
the voice of a girl, and when she called his name
he remembered.
take that book!
he remembered all those from whose ashes he was made.
all the pain and all the grief.
the Shadow remembered, and he was determined to take revenge.
revenge on those whose cruelty was the cause of all this misfortune.
make her stop. - Shadow went to his master. . .
and reached out to him with ashen hands.
that's not right! Take it away!
that's not the book. Those aren't the real words.
stop her. Somebody stop her reading!
stop her! - Meggie, watch out!
give that here! give it back!
what a pleasant turn of events.
Silvertongue, you're just in time for dinner!
No!
not my castle!
attack!
attack!
get off! Get out of my way!
Resa.
No! Get off!
you think these misfits can conquer me?
go! Devour her!
you'll have to get past me first! - Watch out, Mo!
just keep reading!
what? - Keep reading!
I can't! there's nothing left to read.
then write.
come on, Meggie!
you can do it!
the Shadow turned away from the innocent.
come on, Meggie.
the Shadow turned away from the innocent.
and back to the evil master who had controlled him all these years.
the Shadow reached out to him with ashen hands.
and as it did
Capricorn began to crackle and fade like the old page of a book. . .
growing transparent and thin as paper.
I won't let you!
dad!
Capricorn's ink-black soul filled with terror. . .
as he saw the end was near.
and so, too, did the souls of all those within the Shadow's gaze.
who'd committed villainy in Capricorn's name.
and then they blew away, like ashes in the wind
No!
while the terrible monster himself disintegrated and was no more.
it's Meggie. She's reading.
they're going back into their books. I'm going to miss it!
I don't want to go back into my stinking book.
those who'd been summoned against their will,
who were in sight of the girl. . .
were set free, and set right and sent back from whence they came.
Mo. Mo!
toto?
Meggie!
please, Set me free.
and the old creator finally got his wish. . .
disappearing into the world he had only dreamed about.
and then, finally, after what seemed almost a lifetime of wishing. . .
the young girl finally got her most heartfelt dream.
while the mother she knew she'd see again
and the father she cherished. .
Meggie.
came running to embrace their only.
darling, I missed you.
what happened?
I missed it.
I missed it. They're all gone.
I got here too late to go home.
he'll never read me back in now.
he said he'd try. After he got his wife back.
well, he won't. He'd never risk losing her again.
and I wouldn't make him.
stop it, Elinor. It's so silly to cry at happy endings.
come here.
Dustfinger.
Dustfinger?
let's go. Come on, It's time to go.
let's run. Come on. Meggie. - Meggie, quickly. Come on.
the book's gone.
we don't need it. - Great. I'll have nightmares for weeks.
come on. Come on.
you're all right?
you were going to leave without me?
Oh, no.
you're better off with them. - Well, if you're going. . .
you should probably bring this with you.
you stole this?
I learned from the best. I thought maybe we could find someone.
another reader. Someone who could send you back.
what about that girl?
you like her, don't you?
you come with me, you may never see her again.
I stole photo from silvertongue's pocket.
well, if I'm going to be saddled with you. . .
you can make yourself useful.
we got a long walk ahead of us.
Dustfinger.
Dustfinger!
I promised.
it's your turn now.
great.
you sure you want this?
you remember what happens at the end of the book.
it's like I told the writer. He doesn't control me.
my fate's in my own hands now.
good luck.
Hey, don't take this the wrong way, but don't come back, okay?
do it.
it had been many years since Dustfinger had set eyes on the rolling meadows and the old mill.
but it was even more beautiful than he remembered.
"the butterflies flitted above the grass. . . . "
he's gone back.
where he wants to be.
what about you?
I can't follow him.
because I've kept Gwin behind,
the end of his story will be different.
he's not going to die.
you can stay with us.
it was mum's idea.
sorry. Shouldn't I have said that?
just don't expect me to read you back.
you can teach me to read? - Yeah.
maybe.
I can teach you dragon's breath.
roxanne!
Roxanne.
Ouch. Shit. Shit.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
it's okay. I have another one.
aII right.
slow down.
just follow me.
you like that?
tell me you like it.
I just did.
please don't tell me you're taking lessons from that Neanderthal.
no. No.
good. I want us to be special.
that's disgusting.
Hey, let's explore.
Marco.
Hey, what's the holdup? This sucks.
why is there traffic?
what is going on? What is that?
this is crazy.
a spokesman released a statement ten minutes ago saying that the quarantine exercise will be for 24 hours...
Charlie 1-4, this is Charlie...
we have visual contact.
we got reservations at 7.
you mean to tell me we can't get through?
this is bullshit. Bullshit.
you can't do this. We're in America.
who gave the order for this exercise?
sir, my orders are to keep this road sealed off for the next 24 hours.
you can take your son to the hospital in town.
those guys don't know their asses from a hole in the ground.
I want to go to a real hospital.
sir, I understand.
not unless you have kids, you don't fucking understand.
honey, you're not helping.
we're going to Boulder.
corporal Cross? Platoon up.
you heard the man. Let's go. Let's go.
sir, I'm asking you politely.
please turn your car around. Please.
Mrs. Leitner? What?
Sarah, what are you doing here?
your mom told me you were never coming back.
well, you know how she exaggerates.
besides, I'm needed here.
look, I'm sorry that I yelled, but can you get us out of here?
Cody is really sick.
Mr. Leitner, I understand that you're upset, but the best thing that you can do for Cody right now is to get him to the medical center.
the Army's brought in specialists.
they're already there at the hospital.
that'll be much quicker than driving to Boulder.
she's right.
thank you.
aII right, get the rest of these cars turned around.
okay, you heard the captain.
let's get all of the cars turned around.
excuse me, sir.
sir.
did I just tell them the truth?
corporal, your orders are to keep this shit hole town
excuse me. Your shit hole town sealed off.
now do it.
Yes, sir.
0616, over.
Yeah, where the hell are those med 'chines?
they were supposed to be here three hours ago.
they haven't reported in, sir.
we've got teams searching now.
no. Both of them?
Nina?
Nina?
hello.
gotcha! - Aah!
I got you.
not really. - Yeah, right.
What'd you find?
I don't know.
you want to check it out?
find a cool little spot?
in a dark hole? I don't think so.
Hey, didn't you say something about your mother being sick with the flu?
Yeah, she's in bed.
you think she'd know if we were on your couch?
zip it up, Kyle.
what?
we're out of here. Come on.
I'm not really done here.
you want a ride? You're done.
your friend's a real buzz kill.
tell me about it.
Oh, God.
Jesus, you okay, man?
chill. It stopped. Are you my mom?
okay, okay, come on. We gotta go.
Nina and I have, you know, plans.
my parents aren't getting home for a couple of hours.
want to come over?
are you nuts?
if you got me sick, I'll kill you.
no.
come on, Kyle! Bus is leaving!
let's go! - Wait!
this is KSWT, broadcasting live from downtown Leadville, Colorado.
so I have some travel news for all of you trying to get out of town.
route 40 will be closed until 7: 30 tomorrow night.
still, they keep saying this is just an exercise.
now, Uncle Sam wouldn't be trying to lie to us, would he?
no. Stay tuned for further bulletins.
in the meantime, when the man gives them to me,
I'll give them to you.
and now, some more inane bull stuff.
so, as a cog in the military industrial complex, are you capable of independent thought?
sir, my orders are to relay the information to you so you can pass it on to the public.
this ain't about that flu thing, is it?
so what the fuck is it about?
you are gonna talk to me, so help me God.
Or...Celine Dion.
you probably like her.
well, hey, come on.
you know, it was just my allergies.
look, I'll give you money.
what?
well-- Fuck you.
I'm walking home.
Where'd she go?
she said she needed some exercise.
~ Everything is all right ~
~ Things can be as they should ~
~ If you look after me ~
~ The way I looked after you ~
we're so over, Kyle.
Kyle?
Hey, Private, why don't you be all you can be and grab them damn batteries?
can you believe they're gonna give that bitch a gun?
get this to Captain Rhodes as soon as you can.
corporal Cross.
we were given orders to report to your squad.
think I'm gonna like it here.
you were at Fort Bragg, right?
Yes.
Yeah, I heard about you.
you and my homie Henry Fat was hitting it for a couple months, right?
you and your homie got your wires crossed.
it didn't happen.
if you say so.
as of now, you two are on guard duty.
this is your barricade.
no one gets through. You got that?
crain, you the driver?
Yes, sir. Um, God.
ma'am.
you up for a road trip?
Yeah.
no one gets through.
how long we supposed to stay here?
we'll try and be back before breakfast.
that's , like, 12 hours!
we'll bring you a bagel.
Ahem. Are we really spending the night together?
not a chance. - Okay, good, because that wouldn't be appropriate.
he was definitely hitting that.
shut up.
I-- I thought you wanted me to drive.
I know the way.
you just join?
Really? You can tell?
Yeah, seven months ago.
I was studying radar and countermeasures.
my first time being called out.
kind of wish it was something a little more exciting.
be careful what you wish for.
I've seen exciting.
you don't have to worry.
nothing really happens in this town anyway.
Yeah, it seems like a real shit hole.
where are we going anyway?
my house.
Oh, so you're from here?
born and raised.
well, it's kind of a charming shit hole.
all right, I'll be back.
listen, Crain sounds so formal.
what do your friends call you?
um, my friends call me Bud.
bud. - Okay.
well, when we're not around the others, you can call me Sarah.
nothing on TV?
Sarah?
haven't you heard of knocking?
uh, this is my house, too.
you want privacy, find a new place.
what's going on, Nina? Nothing, really.
your father still teaching Sunday school?
this is so not cool.
you know what, you missed a button right there.
what the hell are you doing here?
enforcing the quarantine.
what's up with not returning my calls?
what quarantine? - What calls?
you're kidding me.
I called your cell phone, like, five or six times.
you know what? Where's Mom?
in bed, I guess.
you guess. - I just got home.
she wasn't feeling well this morning.
and you didn't check on her?
I check on her every day.
that's a lot more than some people.
get over it, Trevor.
Hey, Mom.
Sarah, honey.
I didn't know you were coming.
I guess you were too busy to call.
how are you feeling, Mom?
I'm okay.
no, you're not. You're burning up.
please, you have more important things to do than worry about me.
what are you doing here?
I'm taking you to the hospital.
don't be silly.
it's just a cold. I took some vitamins.
mom, I'm taking you to the hospital, okay?
let's get you dressed.
my dad's left a dozen messages. They're at the hospital.
how long has Mom been sick?
since this morning. It's a cold.
everyone's got it. And when did you start caring?
don't start with me.
Kyle had it really bad.
his nose was gushing blood.
where is he now?
home. He found his dad's supply of medical hash.
I'm gonna run over there and check on him.
wait, wait.
wait, you can't even go upstairs to check on your own mother, and now you want to go all the way across town?
no. You're gonna go upstairs, make sure Mom gets dressed, and don't leave until I get back.
do you think you can handle that?
I'll go check on Kyle.
Aye-aye, Admiral Bitch.
everything okay?
no, it's not.
Kyle.
anybody here?
Oh, shit.
don't worry. It's not loaded.
Oh, my God.
what the hell happened here?
Aah! Fuck!
fuck! Uhh! Oh!
what's there?
the phone is dead.
fuck.
Oh, God.
I don't have any service.
Yeah. Come on.
let's go.
fitzsimmons, 1 4 Cypress Pond Road.
the boy Kyle is missing.
the bodies look like they were mauled by something.
I couldn't call the police.
all the phones are dead. Over.
Yes, I know, Corporal.
we're blocking all phone lines until we get control of the situation.
got a whole lot of wild rumors running around here.
I'll get that info to the police.
where are you?
I need to take my mother to the hospital, Sir.
well, I'm headed over there right now to see if I can find some missing doctors.
you get back to that roadblock ASAP.
Yes, sir. Over and out.
why isn't your gun loaded?
it's complicated.
cool.
I'm a vegetarian, by the way.
maybe we should just keep that between us.
was Kyle stoned?
he wasn't there.
did his parents know where he was?
no.
Oh, oh. I'm bleeding.
there's gauze in the kit.
aII right. Here, here, I got it.
here, tilt your head back.
careful. You got it?
so when are you going back to Denver?
park it and meet us inside.
Yes, Ma'am.
slow down!
Oh!
jerk!
excuse me, ma'am, my mom needs a doctor.
Yeah, her and everyone else.
look, here.
just write her name on the list, and we'll get to her.
I-I can't wait.
listen, lady, half the town's sick.
we're overwhelmed and understaffed.
just write her name down on the list.
Mom...look, they're a bit overwhelmed, okay?
we're going to have to wait.
what?
do you mind?
I found my mom and dad.
they're in a room, waiting for the doctor.
you want to come with? - Yeah. I'll be right back.
Trevor, wait!
stay here.
Salazar, you're supposed to be on guard duty.
williams and Elders have it covered.
captain had me come with him.
you know the phone lines are down.
the cell phones aren't even working.
I heard it was orders from Washington.
you think this is still just an exercise?
Nah. There's some real serious shit going down.
corporal Cross.
sir.
there's a doctor here from the CDC.
he wants to ask you about the bodies at Cypress Pond.
he was annoyingly insistent.
Sarah's great, huh?
I wish she were around more.
um, does she have a boyfriend?
she's hot, huh?
Oh, she's so hot.
you think she'd ever go out with a private?
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm a little bit
are you all right?
Oh, my God.
you're freezing.
I need some help over here!
come on, man.
stay with me. Talk to me, talk to me.
talk to me, talk to me, talk to me.
okay, um, Mrs. Cross,
I'm going to go get Sarah.
okay?
corporal Cross!
it has to be airborne.
but once in the blood, it mutates faster than anything else
Dr. Logan, this is Corporal Cross.
thanks for coming.
can you give us a minute?
I find people speak more freely without a superior officer around.
I'll be outside.
you've had quite a night.
you could say that.
about the bodies, you said they looked like they were mauled.
could it have been an animal attack?
if an animal can hide a body in a closet.
the son is missing?
Yes.
did the wounds look like bite marks?
what?
it's a simple question.
how would I know?
maybe it's the avian flu.
don't say that.
dad, seriously, that's so not possible.
I heard about this case in France where
dad?
daddy, what's wrong?
dad?
daddy?
what's going on?
daddy?
dad!
dad?
okay, we-- we really need a doctor.
sir? Sir?
corporal, you gotta come to the waiting room.
something's happening.
to my mom? To everybody.
what is it? Something bad. I don't know.
Hey, I thought you guys left hours ago.
what the
No! No!
No! Oh! Aah!
Oh, my God! Anybody!
so this chick takes her top off, right?
and I swear to God
what the
now this here's just a little too much for this cowboy.
now, you see this button here?
you press it, and you talk into that if you've got something to say to the folks because my shift has now ended, and I am going to mosey on home.
or not.
Hey, where the hell are you going?
Hey, I thought you said there were two bodies.
Yeah. Now there's three.
show me.
are you sure this is a good idea?
Hey, maybe you shouldn't go down there!
what the fuck?
what the fuck?
come on, come on, come on.
go, go, go, go.
God!
Oh, my God!
no, no, no, no!
No! No!
here they come!
what the fuck was that?
let me in!
come on. Come on.
what the hell?
what the hell is happening to these people?
I don't know.
Where's the basement? - Right there.
my mom's in there.
we'll go undercover.
that's an order, Corporal!
come on!
here.
we're safe!
what the hell was that? You almost got me killed.
what do you mean? What are you talking about?
bud! Help me.
Oh, my God.
what are we going to do?
fuck!
come on.
look at the radio station.
look, there's somebody in there.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
we're going to make it, okay?
I swear.
we can make Molotov cocktails.
great, and I'll just build a bus and drive us out of here.
come on, we have weapons.
I don't have a gun. - What?
I'm in communications. We aren't issued weapons.
so basically you're useless.
shut up, Logan.
come on. You've got one.
we can shoot enough of them.
it's not loaded.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
what the hell kind of soldier are you?
you don't want to find out right now, okay?
bud, where did you park the Humvee?
the lot was full, so I-- oh, shit.
they must have come out when I was
great. A driver without keys and a soldier without bullets.
it must be my fucking birthday.
what's with you two?
you know what? It's complicated, okay, pal?
how did you get here?
taxi.
great. Well, you're nominated to go out and hail us another one.
captain Rhodes' Humvee.
he should have the keys on him. We've got to go get them.
what? No! No. No way!
those things are everywhere.
not everywhere.
come on.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
hello.
hello. Hello, hello, hello!
somebody.
Hello! Hello?
stop pounding. Look!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Shh!
Oh, God, I'm gonna die!
open the damn door!
open the door now!
open up!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
open the door!
someone help!
someone open the door!
Oh, God! Hurry! Hurry!
are you one of them? - No!
are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
you better not be!
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner. Oh, you're all right.
Where's Cody? Is he okay? Is he
we wanted to get Cody to a doctor, but your sister wouldn't let us, and now he's dead.
Andrew, stop it!
my cough-- I had it before all this.
I'm not sick.
come on.
Jesus.
sweet mother of God! Don't
Yuck!
God.
do you want me to go?
Yeah. But I outrank you.
okay.
Salazar. Are you all right?
not if you keep karate kicking me.
how did you get away?
when everybody started tripping, I just jumped in the closet.
keep laughing, bitch.
all right, I'm taking Rhodes' Humvee.
Oh, man.
you won't be needing this.
I got 'em. Let's go.
correct, my shit. Uhh!
go.
GRRR! No!
what? What happened?
what is it? Aah!
give me some room! Go!
come on!
he's got me!
stop!
pull!
let's go! Come on!
go!
catch! Come on!
pull!
tell me you remembered the keys.
Aah! God!
God!
Ah, fuck, he got me.
Oh, fuck, he got me.
Oh, fuck, he got me. He got me.
I'm sorry.
Aah! Oh, fuck!
this is gonna be quick.
no, no!
you saw what happened to Rhodes when he got bit, okay?
this is the only way.
I put bleach on it.
shut up!
put the gun down. That's an order.
I don't know if you noticed, but there's people out there eating each other, okay?
so fuck you and your orders.
I said shut up!
what are you going to do? You going to shoot me?
Hey, look, Rhodes was bitten hundreds of times, him once.
besides, bleach kills just about everything.
who the fuck are you?
look, I'm a doctor, okay? I know exactly what's
man, ain't nobody trying to hear that CSI bullshit.
he gotta go.
didn't I say shut the fuck up?
sir.
look, I will take responsibility for him.
and if the time comes,
I'll do what has to be done, okay?
so just back down!
look, I ain't got time for this bullshit.
we need to figure out how to get the fuck out of here.
I'm watching.
my eye's on you!
call the police, the National Guard, and if by any slim chance the fucking FCC are listening, they might take notice.
I gotta take a break.
this fucking blood pressure's killing me.
I shouldn't have done that kumquat diet.
it's probably too late to stop smoking.
I'm the one who should be worried.
your wife's been hacking up a storm since you got here.
what are you trying to say?
can I give this a try?
Hey, you got a license?
no.
me, neither.
I ain't got a fucking license.
if anyone's there
you go, kid.
if anyone can hear this, we are trapped at the radio station
KXWT on Elm Street in Leadville, Colorado.
uh, uh, we are under attack. Repeat. We are under attack.
if anyone is there at all
...we need help. Okay? Something's happening.
people are going out of their minds.
please, please, please, send help.
there's five of us here.
it's me, my girlfriend Nina,
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, and the DJ.
just somebody send something, okay?
we're at the radio station KXWT on Elm Street.
Oh, oh, and if you hear my voice, do not go to the Pine Valley Hospital.
okay? It's not safe there.
repeat. Do not go to the hospital.
we should go now.
okay.
take this and give me one of your guns.
what, you little Miss MacGyver now?
that shit ain't gonna work.
give me one of your guns.
if something happens to you, we can't risk losing both of them.
I know how to shoot one of those.
I bet you do.
sweet spear.
you see a black man with a sharp stick and it's supposed to be a spear?
Oh, no, that's not what I
bud, can you throw this chair through the window?
Yeah.
do you have your lighter? - Yeah.
let's do this. Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay...Now!
you gotta shoot them in the head.
Oh, my God!
Jesus!
Oh, my God.
let's go, Doc!
watch out!
shit!
watch out!
Oh, shit.
let's go.
please help me.
I'll help you.
Aah!
come on, y'all!
I got him!
I'm out.
me, too. Shit.
Where's Logan?
what a dick.
there's more of these motherfuckers?
light 'em.
come on.
okay.
Oh, shit!
that worked.
Yeah.
behind you!
nice shot.
it was kinda gangsta, huh?
we gotta get some more ammo.
hang on.
this is bullshit.
Hey, yo, Gomer.
don't give up, man.
Yeah, I won't .
shit!
what you dodging them for? Run their ass over.
they're still somebody.
not anymore.
that was kinda fun.
that is unbelievable.
we have to get out of here.
do you have a car?
no, I ain't going out there.
Hey, dude, if you're feeling lucky, you go for it.
I'd be like prime rib to those fuckers.
I'm sitting my fat ass right here till the help comes.
let's just wait. Somebody will come.
they have to.
so which one of you had the nosebleed?
what? You heard her.
anybody have a nosebleed?
just sit down and answer the question.
what is wrong with you?
Nina, put that down. What are you doing?
everyone who changed had a nosebleed.
who's lying?
had to be one of them.
I said sit down.
Hey, you don't wanna eat this. Major indigestion.
she hasn't had a nosebleed, and neither have I.
look at them. They're covered in blood.
shut up!
my son attacked a nurse.
it's her blood!
Hey, check them for bite marks.
no one's touching my wife.
just answer the fucking question!
don't you get it?
someone in here is infected.
we're all in danger.
all right. Let's make this quick.
what about your boy back here?
bud, I'm sorry.
no, no. I understand.
you all right?
Yeah.
do me a favor.
Yeah. Anything.
grab me a gun, too, and, um, load mine.
Yeah, that's the type of shit I'm talking about.
fucking tell us.
Yeah. Now, just
Oh, God.
you scared me.
Paul?
get off the couch!
okay.
is anyone alive out there?
can anyone hear me? Anyone? Anyone?
the police? Someone? We just need someone.
something's fucking happened.
we need someone. Please, anyone.
don't think they know who they fucking with.
automatics have no firepower.
Oh, yeah? Says who?
this shit right here was made for me.
by the power of Grayskull.
okay. Yeah.
stop fucking around and start loading the stuff up.
how long you gonna keep cussing at me?
you see this? This is a machete.
unappreciative ass. See if I save your ass again.
Oh, shit.
No! He's restrained.
what if he gets loose?
then I'll shoot him.
look, I'm not riding with this motherfucker.
Yes! Shut the fuck up!
my, God, he listened.
sales of new homes rose
Plus, with pop
ever since day one
I don't understand.
they're not saying anything about this.
word hasn't gotten out yet.
...the Army, the National Guard, anyone with weapons...
Oh, my God.
is anyone still alive?
what the hell are you doing?
out of town is the other way.
that's my brother.
your brother's a DJ?
just send someone. We're being attacked.
we need help. We need help now.
damn it, where the fuck is the cavalry?
what are you doing?
Oh, my God. Mom!
Trevor! I have to let her in!
Trevor, wait!
Oh, shit!
that's what I'm talking about!
run their ass over!
now you're driving.
wait! Wait!
she could be infected! No!
why'd you lie about the nosebleed?
don't worry. It'll be fine.
I promise.
mom!
Trevor!
Aah!
Oh, God.
Trevor.
Trevor, it wasn't her.
not anymore.
Nina, is there anybody else up there?
Yes.
bring them down. We're getting out of here.
we are?
go!
okay. Okay. Okay.
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner, we've been rescued. Come on.
it's time to go.
Mr. and Mrs. Leitner?
No!
Trevor, I'm sorry.
yo, survivors.
Hello!
come on.
it's soldiers. Come on!
Nina! Hey!
quick, get over here.
come on, man. They're coming, man.
hurry up. They're coming!
Aah! Oh, no! Oh, no!
we need to leave.
let's go!
this shit is ridiculous.
I mean, why Thriller over here ain't trying to eat us?
he's a vegetarian.
that's the best explanation you can come up with?
you got a better one?
aII I'm saying, as long as he don't try to mistake me for a soybean burger, we gonna be all right.
they seem to retain some part of themselves before they were infected.
must've retained his hormones because he definitely remembers who you are.
guess that also means he remembers who was boss, huh, bitch?
bad soldier.
ten hut!
that's some crazy-ass shit.
Williams, Captain Rhodes is down.
do you have any idea where
check if the SATCOM's working.
come on. Let's go!
let's get out of here!
them fools were shooting at me!
what we taking, a back road out of here?
there is no back road.
Sarah, go up Hidden Lake Road.
we could get to Boulder on the fire road.
Yeah, you're right. Good thinking.
okay, hold on.
Hey.
you okay?
remember I said we're gonna make it?
we are.
never going back, are we?
I don't know, Trevor.
you know, why did you leave in the first place instead of opening the bike shop?
you think I was gonna wait around for you to get your shit together? Who built the first bike?
that broke and almost killed me when we were, like, 50 miles from home?
could y'all save that shit for Oprah, please?
what the fuck was that?
Kyle.
come on, get out!
what's happening, player?
at ease, soldier.
all right.
Kyle.
is there any reason why we're keeping this bitch around?
everyone grab as much firepower as you can.
look at that shit.
he likes you.
got a little zombie crush.
we need to find cover, some place we can defend.
the old Nike site's about a mile from here.
Yeah, you're right, we can hole up there, wait for daylight. Good call.
all right, we're gonna keep Bud with us.
Why?
he might be useful against them.
and he follows orders. I like that.
but if he tries anything...
head shot.
Yeah, come on, Mr. Follows Orders.
about face!
Oh, my
forward march!
what was that?
I don't know, but be ready for anything.
let's move out!
come on, let's go.
have a seat.
what the hell you looking at?
I know you're not looking at her ass.
I think ol' Gomer over here wants
Salazar, leave him alone!
Trevor.
good idea.
I'll lead with this.
don't count on me.
look, you wanna drop the passive aggressive bullshit for once, please?
over some bicycles? What's with you two?
it's complicated.
he's a kid.
Yeah, but we all have to grow up sometime.
now would be nice.
bud! Bud! Stop it!
bud! Bud, stop it!
let's go!
Hey! Follow me!
this way!
let's go!
Hey, guys.
come on! Cover him!
nice shot.
Thanks.
Hey, come on.
what the hell?
a Puffy video.
of course.
yo, we got company.
Trevor, you loaded?
full up.
all right, stay here with Nina, okay? We'll be back.
wait, please don't shoot! Don't shoot!
the fuck are you doing here?
I-- I was trying to get away.
those things were after me.
I found this compound. I just came here for shelter.
so you took off to save your own ass?
no.
and destroy some kind of evidence, huh?
says something about Project Wildfire.
your name's on every one of them.
what is Project Wildfire?
I don't know how my name
listen to me! My mom's dead.
my hometown's turned into a fucking slaughterhouse.
you either tell me what you know, or so help me, I will shoot you dead right here.
look, if you'll just give me a second to explain
don't lie to her.
if you'll let me finish
go ahead.
there were a few select scientists studying certain biochemical agents.
including you?
were you studying them or creating them?
look, I was in Washington to give a report.
I couldn't reach anyone here.
then I heard about the quarantine.
look, we don't know our research has anything to do with this outbreak.
Yes, we do.
the virus
it was three days ago.
...has mutated, and somehow we have all become infected or eaten, and I'm the last.
I think I've killed them all.'
Tom, Grace, and everyone.
I, uh...
have sealed myself inside this bunker.
I've destroyed the samples and archived my notes.
and I don't know why the infection is moving so slowly, but I can feel it.
I can feel the malevolence.
I'll die here like the pharaohs with my legacy, a beautiful weapon...
beautiful weapon.
what was this virus supposed to do?
it was designed to paralyze enemy troops by shutting down their neural system for six to seven hours.
we didn't think it would mutate.
come on, this would have allowed us to capture people without killing them.
it was intended to save lives.
Yeah, hell of a job, Doc.
he got out.
Yeah, the door was open when Nina and I got here.
why aren't we all sick?
some people have a natural immunity to specific viruses.
lucky us.
but from what I understand, once bitten, there's no protection.
whatever, man. Where's the back door?
there isn't one.
Oh, shit.
stay here.
you back?
I'm not going to die down here, but you, you knew about this.
no, I didn't know. I swear.
Nina, Nina, no. He's not worth it.
he's smarter than the others.
don't believe this shit.
I'm not going back into that airshaft.
shut up, bitch.
Hey, did you guys get him?
he's in the ventilation system.
Yeah, I got his little girlfriend, though.
that's Dr. Engel.
he was the best man on the team.
if they do retain something of what they were, we are so screwed.
we have to find a way out.
that's the only way out.
that's why we chose this place.
man, I thought scientists were supposed to be smart.
here, follow me.
dumb asshole.
this place is a Nike site, right?
Yeah.
well, they weren't making sneakers up in here.
nike sites were built during the Cold War to house missiles.
what?
what, you were smoking weed during history class?
anyways, there were missiles, and there had to be missile silos.
we find one of those, and we'll have our escape route.
Hey, what happened to Fuck-Face?
Oh, Jesus.
we have to find that silo.
it's going to take forever to search all these hallways.
we've got to split up.
we meet back here in five minutes.
why do white people always want to split up?
I'm not doing it.
he's right.
whatever. It's y'all's funeral. Who is going with who?
Trevor, you're gonna go with me.
no. Trevor and I stick together.
we'll be okay.
all right. Five minutes.
not a second longer.
be careful.
you look hot.
shut the fuck up.
lucky somebody paid attention during history class.
Yeah, you're not as dumb as you look.
Oh, yeah?
well, you're not as annoying as you look.
just in case.
go!
Sarah, run!
are you all right?
Yeah. Salazar?
great.
holy shit. What?
it's missile propulsion tanks.
are you sure?
Yeah.
we can rig these like giant flamethrowers, get all those things in one place, and just blast the shit out of them.
all right.
as soon as Nina knocks the nozzles off the tanks, all I have to do is
are you all right?
it's fine.
all right, I'm going to be running like hell.
as soon as I clear, you fire the tanks, okay?
got it.
and don't worry, it's going to work.
I know.
Hey, Sarah?
yeah?
don't get eaten.
Hey!
now!
see if Logan left the keys.
an update on the outbreak in Leadville, Colorado.
we're getting sketchy reports that bodies are still being discovered, but a spokesman for the military has assured us that the flu-like virus has been fully contained.
so while travel to and from the area won't be fully restored for several days, it looks like the danger is over.
this is Haley Schue reporting for KDSX, Colorado County.
Aah!
coming!
who is it?
Hello?
who is it?
stop fuckin' around!
whoever's screwing around out there better quit it or l'll come and kick the shit out of you!
asshole.
who the fuck keeps knocking on the door?
who's there?
Hey, guys, wait up.
come on, Curt! Ha ha! Not waiting today.
people to do, things to see.
you guys see the play that Shawn made this weekend?
no. - Oh my God, amazing.
l wish you would stop playing though. Terrible.
he is not terrible.
speaking of sucking... - Thanks.
Hey, Uggi, tell your dad after all our parents reelect him, he better hook us up with some easy summer jobs.
Yeah, sure thing.
Yeah, me and Nicole can be lifeguards at the pool.
we could just hang out all day in the sun, driving all the old men crazy.
pool? Uh... you're gonna be working in the library.
the library?
okay then. We'll have all the bookworms beating off in the corner.
get out --- That's disgusting.
Hey, Nik, what was your grandfather doing outside school before?
my mom told him to stay away from the house.
Why?
l mean, you've just never talked about him before.
he was a city cop his whole life.
he even missed my father's funeral because of some case that he was working on.
that sucks. - Yeah.
and now after all these years he wants to get to know me.
he seems like a cool guy.
then you get to know him, Tom.
Hey, did you guys hear about that girl that got robbed in Jeffersonville?
she went to grammar school here. - Who cares?
did you know her?
no, she was a little younger than us.
her dad's a general contractor though.
he owns, uh, that big boarding company, SlPCO.
Yeah, l know him. Our dads were friends.
they used to play football here.
Yeah, well, l heard her house was broken into and she was...
what?
well, my dad won't tell me, but l know she's... dead.
uh, there's a reason why your dad won't tell.
you're a burnout!
look who's talking, bitch!
Oh, God, Cindy, that's disgusting.
will you two get a room?
can l help you?
can l give youse a ride home?
no. - Come on, Nicole.
can't Grandpa do anything for you?
l don't need a grandfather now.
l just wanna talk. Please.
just stop harassing me, all right?
just -- just leave me alone. Just leave me alone.
please. Nicole, please.
the beginning to another great season for the Glass County Lions!
like before in the years past
like when l was on the team
we're gonna bring home that trophy!
and when we do bring home that trophy...
...best party ever!
thank you and good night!
okay, why are you talking with your mouthpiece in?
why do you have a mouthpiece in, anyway? lt's a pep rally.
l'm trying to get ready for the season.
Why? You're not gonna need it on the bench.
Whoa! Ooh! - Oh, snap.
yo, why don't you bench these?
at least l made the team. - 'Cause he fits into the small uniform.
Hey, Uggi, maybe you should take a picture.
l mean, l hear they last longer.
Oh, good idea. - Get out of here!
leave him alone, Billy.
"leave him alone, Billy. "
Mickey Masturbator over here.
l hear he freakin' whacks off every night to the thoughts of my girl.
what the hell are you talking about?
what?
seems as though you have a staring problem yourself.
don't worry, Uggi, you have me. - Aww.
all right, down, Uggi. Down! Down!
Hey, but your old man really did get us - fired up tonight, man. - Yeah, the way Uggi looks, so did your girlfriend.
yeehaw! Whoo!
Oh! Shit! No!
knock knock.
who's there?
Oh my God! No!
good evening, Billie.
now what brings you all the way out here tonight?
miss being around you, Deputy.
my God.
didn't think anything like this made it out of the city.
what do you have?
his mother says there was a knock at the door.
she opened it, she saw nobody. She opened it some more.
she saw her son hanging on the door.
so far we have no clues, no motive, no witnesses-- nothing.
Where's the mother now? - She's in the den with the husband.
get him down as soon as you can.
Hey. Hey!
turn up the TV.
...in Glass County, a gruesome murder took place.
glass County Sheriff's office believe that the Jerome Peters murder was the direct result of a high-school prank gone very very wrong...
gee, who -- who would do a prank like that?
that was no prank.
Hey, they said --- Who's " they " ?
who said? Your police?
they wouldn't know a murderer if he handed them their business card.
well, here's mine. And it looks like you've had enough for one night.
wow, Detective Billie Vega.
high voice for a guy.
she ain't built like any guy l know, Mick.
Yeah, well, l seen better.
Hank, have you seen Cutter?
uh, Billie, no, not yet.
Thanks.
that was no prank.
eat it -- eat it right up.
Hey, where you been, man? - Yeah, we just ordered.
l stopped by Coach Sully's office.
he said Jerome was killed with ice picks.
all right, guys, here we go. Cheeseburger, yours.
sweet, nice.
got a side salad order and you guys are splitting the B. L. T. How about you?
can l get you something? - No, thanks.
he said he was literally stuck to the door.
lce picks? What's up with that?
l heard they were actually after his brother and mistakenly killed Jerome.
no way.
Jerome's brother's older and much bigger.
dude, my little brother's bigger.
Billy, what's wrong with you?
your friend gets killed by a lunatic and all you can do is sit here and make fun?
Uggi, what's -- what's your father think?
l don't know. l haven't seen him.
he's been down at Town Hall all night.
l heard him on the news, though, saying it was a prank.
a prank? Come on.
lt was a black thing.
you know how they are.
you're really screwed up.
no, the person who did this is screwed up.
look!
at what?
did you see him? - See who?
there was a guy just standing out there staring at me.
was he cute?
no, he was this -- this big scary-looking guy.
and he -- he was just looking at me.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
a big scary-looking guy!
Boo-hoo-hoo, everyone! - Cut it out, Billy!
he was just standing there.
dude, come on, quarters down.
seriously, could you spit more food out at me?
so, Uggi, have you heard from Jules tonight?
Yeah, she said she had to back to her father's shop and give him a hand with some stuff.
with what, a motor job?
Nik was really freaked out over that guy.
Oh my gosh! What guy?
there was no one around. Wait... did you see anyone?
she looked like she'd seen a ghost, a big one.
okay, well, let's go inside and l'll show you a big one.
Billy, is that all you ever think about?
Oh, come on. And you don't?
no, not right now.
Hey, Billy.
l -- um
Hey, hi... Toni.
Hi, T-Toni.
you know...
my sister's hot, but...
she's... just not hot like this.
l...
would fucking tear... you... up.
but then...
l don't think you'd be able to function, no less play football.
Hey, Cin, l'm gonna go spend the weekend at Brad's house.
Billy, baby...
wipe your drool.
Billy, what are you doing?
come upstairs!
Yeah.
Hike! Go! Go!
Hike! Go! Go!
what? l thought you could run faster.
you know, l'm better off just throwing to the pothead.
what, were you scared, you little bitch?
what?
what, Nik? Nik -- hey -- hey
what -- what happened?
lt was him. - Who, Nik?
lt was that guy. - What
what guy, Nik? There's nobody around here.
lt was the guy standing in the window.
he's -- he's following me.
there's no one here, Nik.
he was -- he was so big.
and his face was --- Hey hey.
okay, what did he look like?
burned.
come on, Nicole. l think it was just your imagination.
lt was real! l walked right into him!
lt was real! Guys, l'm not crazy!
lt was real.
all right, come on. Let's get you home.
Oh-ho-ho.
Oh, that is beautiful...
if l do say so myself.
Troy! What's wrong with the lights?
Troy, do you hear me?
who's at the door?!
Troy, do you hear me?
well -- who is it?
Mrs. Olen? - Yes?
Mrs. Olen, l'm Detective Vega. l think you know Sheriff Cutter.
Mrs. Olen. - Hello.
ls your son Troy home?
ls -- is he in some kind of trouble?
we just need to ask him a few questions, Mrs. Olen.
ls there something wrong with your lights, Mrs. Olen?
must be some kind of a power surge or something.
uh, please, just wait right here.
l'll-- l'll go get Troy. - Thank you.
what have you done?
nothing, Ma. Nothing.
look at this place.
this place hasn't changed in over 20 years.
you've been here?
once or twice when we were kids.
jeez.
they're taking awhile.
let's go take a look.
nothin', Ma. l did nothing.
well, then why is there a detective and -- and that Cutter boy in my house wantin' to talk to you?
l don't know. l don't know, Ma.
well
Mrs. Olen, is everything okay?
Yes.
why shouldn't it be?
Hello, Troy. - Hello.
Troy, some of the kids we spoke to said they saw you looking at them when they left the pep rally.
please, Ma, don't let them take me.
please. - Why would we want to take you, Troy?
did you do something wrong?
please don't hurt my boy.
please!
l didn't do anything.
no, not me, l didn't do anything.
then who, Troy? Who did something?
tell us, Troy.
l didn't do nothin'! l didn't do anything.
leave him alone! He didn't do nothing!
he knows more than he's telling us.
l don't know. l mean, even in high school, l just thought he was a weirdo.
cutter, that's what they said about Ted Bundy.
what did l tell you about being a bad boy, Tommy?
you don't listen, do you?
well, we've got special plans for you, Tommy.
Aw, you might as well say bye-bye, Tommy.
Bye-bye.
silly boy.
there you go.
Oh, Nicole.
so beautiful.
you look pretty today.
but you didn't tell me you missed me yet.
why don't you ever tell me you miss me?
l miss you. l do. Honestly, l do.
how you doing?
well, l'm sweepin'.
God, it is hot in here.
who won the football game?
dad, you know by now, l don't go to those games to watch.
l just go to... hang out.
do you need some help? - Nah.
dad!
What?!
what's the matter?
what's the matter?
nothing, Dad. Nothing.
nothing, l'm -- l'm fine.

l want to go test drive this baby.
Yeah, all right, Dad.
l'll pick up some dinner on the way back.

walk in groups, please.
all right? Pay attention to surroundings.
Hey, Frank. Good seeing you.
don't forget to vote, all right?
thanks a lot.
take care.
try to be home by dark if you can.
see you around, man. - No doubt.
look at this shit. - What?
they want us off the street by dark.
or walking with a large group.
Yeah, right.
Oh -- ah! - And one.
l didn't touch -- whatever.
a football team is a large group.
lt is.
Curt! When you're done getting dressed l need to see you in my office.
okay, Coach!
Hey, why don't you meet me in Coach Sully's office when you're ready?
all right, cool. lt'll take a minute though.
Yeah, l know.
Yeah, right.
come on, Curt.
stop fuckin' around!
your son Shawn looks real good in practice.
he's really gonna light them up this year.
Yeah. l keep telling him he's gotta stay focused, keep working.
game's getting faster all the time.
lt sure is, l'll tell you.
can't keep up with it myself.
what the
'Knock knock " ?
what the hell kinda prank are they playing on me today?
No-oh-oh!
No! No! No! No!
No! - Holy shit.
No!
where you taking me, man? - Shut up!
l didn't do anything.
where -- where you taking me?
please, where are you taking me?
come on! Quiet! - What is this?
come on, Troy, tell me: Why did you kill Shawn Rae Jr?
look at me, Troy! Was it jealousy?
l didn't kill anybody, not me. No, not me.
didn't l tell you to look at me?
do you think this is funny?
l'll smack that fucking smile right off your face.
why did you kill Shawn Rae, Troy?
l didn't kill anybody.
Oh! She has a little tiger in her, huh?
l love that in a woman.
we got our killer? We charging him?
what do you think, Mike?
this guy's not your killer.
what do you mean he's not our killer?
Dean, please.
why do you think that?
Charlie, look at him. He's small, weak.
besides, this guy's left-handed.
the coroner says your guy's gotta be 6'2 " , 6'3 " .
most of all, Charlie, your killer's right-handed.
the coroner?
he stops for a cocktail at The Abbey once in a while.
lnnocent people are being killed.
there are pictures of kids in this book.
start fucking talking, Troy.
the ice pick incisions in the Jerome kid all came from the right side.
she was smacked around on the left side of her face.
and, Charlie, l'm telling you, l'll bet you anything, something on Shawn Rae is gonna lead you to a right-handed killer.
you are good.
what can l tell ya?
l think you're both fuckin' crazy.
we need a killer and we need him now.
so Vega's smacking around an innocent guy?
l didn't say he's innocent, but he's not your killer.
let her get her frustrations out anyway.
maybe it's that time of month or something.
besides, it might soften this prick up a little bit.
well, you better get out of here before she sees you and softens you up a little.
Hey, you know l might like that too.
Hey, Charlie, where's this guy's mother?
out in the waiting area.
do me a favor -- hold 'em here.
l want to do a little snooping around.
we searched the house and his room.
and that's why l'm going.
you think he knows something?
Oh, he knows. He knows a lot.
believe me.
Hey, Mike, you've seen a lot of shit in your day, being on the job.
what do you think of that Shawn kid being killed like that?
and then in his father's place too.
what do you mean " too, " Hank?
that Julie Papas
she was killed in her father's shop too. Right?
you know, you're right.
what do you know about this Rico Volpe?
father or son?
both. - Hey, now you're going back.
father-- local funeral director.
nice dresser and all. Good customer too.
his place burnt down, almost killed his son.
what happened?
the son, Rico Jr.
loner, had no friends.
mother left, father falls behind on the mortgage.
they say he torched the place...
...to collect the insurance money
with his son in it!
shit. - Nice guy, huh?
real nice guy. - Uh-oh.
find anything, Mick?
l don't know what you're talking about.
you know damn well what l'm talking about.
maybe they didn't use warrants in New York, but here we do things by the book.
like tonight, when you smacked around that mamaluke?
ls that by the book?
stay out of my way or l'll fuckin' smack you around.
l might like that.
Billy, l'll be down in just a minute!
don't go anywhere.
Billy, quit trying to scare me.
you're so predictable. Quit fucking around, asshole.
Billy, are you out there?
excuse me.
could you help me a minute, please?
hold on one second, l'll be happy to help you.
l'm sorry to bother you.
l left my glasses home... again.
l was hoping you could help me read this article.
lt's kind of important.
don't even think about it. That's what l'm here for.
thank you.
excuse me.
that's... quite all right.
okay, what do we have here?
okay.
'Yesterday, in Glass County Superior Court,
Rico Volpe Sr. was found guilty of attempted murder and arson after deliberately starting a fire in his funeral home to recoup insurance money.
Mr. Volpe maintained his innocence, stating that he left his son and his son's friend in their home when he left to go on an errand.
firemen found Rico Jr. locked in a casket, still alive, but badly burned.
no other body was found.
sources say defense attorneys had tried to argue that Rico Jr.was responsible for starting the fire, but Volpe refused to reveal the identity of the alleged accomplice.
"Rico Volpe Sr. was sentenced to life in prison. "
he didn't do it. He could never do anything like that.
how would you know that?
l know him. He had a thing for me...
if you know what l mean.
l don't blame him.
thank you.
l know one thing, l know he adored his kids.
kids?
Oh, he has a daughter named Rachel.
she runs a bar called Dylan's on the outskirt of Wayne.
what is she, the barmaid?
she's the bouncer. lf you've had one too many, you find yourself staring at the sidewalk when you wake up.
she's a real tough one.
why don't we have a drink?
l'd love to, sugar.
but like l told you, she's a real tough one.
and she don't like me very much.
maybe next time?
maybe.
what can l get ya? - Let me get a Scotch, tall glass, a lot of ice, please.
you got some body. You work out?
no.
you look like you do.
Yeah, well, l get my workout throwing annoying guys like you out on their asses.
what happened to your wrist?
well, some guy annoyed me, so l knocked him the fuck out...
with one shot.
nice. Very nice. - That's $5. 50.
keep the change.
you are Rachel Volpe, right?
who the fuck are you? - My name's Mike Soato.
yo, hold up. What are you doing?
how many times do l have to tell you they go in the walk-in box.
so what are you, a cop?
used to be. No more.
so then, what do you want here?
l'd like to find out a little more about your brother Rico.
Why? You like being nosy?
what, that's a cop thing, right?
no. l think what happened to him that day has a lot to do with what's going on now.
what, those kid murders?
well, fuck them.
what does it have to do with my brother?
l was hoping you could tell me.
how about l knock your fuckin' lights out?
Jesus Christ. What is it with me and women?
all youse wanna do is hit me.
l wonder why. Listen.
they put my father away for life and they committed my brother.
end of story.
what about your mother?
don't know, don't care.
bitch is dead to me.
like l said: end of story.
how's your brother Rico?
hello.
Marcus, look. You're the mayor.
lf you want to continue to be the fuckin' mayor, you gotta find out what's happening.
our kid's are dying here!
look, l just walked in the house.
Dean, l'll talk to you tomorrow.
God, no! Cindy!
God!
Cindy! Oh, my God! Cindy! No!
No!
okay, Vega, what do you got?
l don't know anymore. This guy is just killing at random.
he has no motive.
try starting with revenge.
what did you say? - Captain, may l?
Yeah, what do you got?
the killer's getting some kind of work-related revenge.
what?
she was killed at her father's workshop.
and today, this kid Billy
also killed in the father's workshop.
what about Cindy and Jerome?
they were both killed in their homes.
Cindy was butchered like a deer.
so? What does that have to do with anything?
Cindy's dad owns Drake's Meat.
Jerome's father is an iceman.
what do we do?
we can tell their friends.
that would take too much of our manpower that we don't have.
you could try to see what the fathers have in common.
what do you think?
find out who's next.
nobody knows that.
he does.
who are you?
what do you want?!
knock knock. - What have l done to you?
who's there? - Why are you doing this to me?!
why are you doing this to me?!
Why-why-- why are you doing this to me?!
Oh my God! No!
what are you gonna do with that?
lt ain't safe out there, Mick.
so me and Suzie here are gonna have to put a stop to it.
you're not gonna stop anything with that.
then how do we?
we?
we can start by having a drink together.
what can l get you, Billie? - Jack, straight up, please.
what's the matter?
you look like a martini girl to me.
martinis are for next time.
here's to the next time.
get me another one and her one.
are you okay, Cindy?
you hurt Cindy Rick.
you hurt Cindy.
l promise he won't do it to you again, Cindy.
because if you do...
you look so beautiful.
you know l love you, don't you?
ls it true you once dressed as a woman to make a bust?
Yeah. Scary, huh? - lt's hilarious.
you think that's funny, you should've seen the time they made me go undercover in a gay bar.
you've seen a lot of shit in your day.
how about you?
biggest things l ever had before this were shoplifters, bootleggers and some domestic violence cases.
usually the same people too.
how come they named you Billie?
father wanted a boy, l guess.
ls that why you got that chip on your shoulder?
my father wasn't nice to me growing up.
l never told anybody this, but he should've had a boy.
ls that why you joined the force?
l was homecoming queen, Miss Teen-everything.
my father was livid.
at least you have the equipment for it.
Thanks.
listen, l'm really sorry about the way l've been treating you.
listen to me, Billie. Listen to me.
don't let this job take your life like it took mine.
l gave my entire life to this job.
even when my wife was dying of cancer, l didn't even have time for her.
and after she died, l sent my only son up here to live with his aunt.
Why?
because l didn't have the time to raise him.
and then just when l thought l'd get to know him...
he goes and dies in a car crash on me.
now l'm trying to get to know my granddaughter
his daughter Nikki.
and she don't want nothing to do with me.
and you know what, Billie?
l don't even blame her.
l'm really sorry.
give her a little more time.
time?
Oh, and another thing
there's more? - Oh, there's more.
don't ever ever tell your commanding officer you don't know. Even when you don't know
you know.
l guess l have a lot to learn.
Hey, l got time.
Oh, God, no!
pick up, Mike.
hello. - Mike, it's Vega.
there's been another murder.
meet me at the skateboard park on Morris Boulevard near the highway.
get here as soon as you can.
l'll be there in a little while. Bye.
so what's up?
l told you they were bad for your health.
so are you?
look, Mike, you said l have a lot to learn, right?
that's right. - Well, school's in.
lt's bad.
come on.
what do you got?
his name was Rick Cohen, 16.
decapitated -- every limb cut off.
Oh, my God. - l've never seen anything like this, not even in the movies.
this kid's out of the circle of the other murder victims.
he goes to a private school.
no connection.
what does his father do?
he's a doctor.
what do you think?
lt's definitely the same killer.
the patterns all match.
the coroner was right.
this guy's extremely fuckin' strong.
and like l said, he's right-handed.
you see how the right side limbs
the cuts are much cleaner?
lf the killer was holding up the body with his left hand, to cut the right side limbs wouldn't be a problem.
otherwise, he'd have to reach over his outstretched arm, making it very difficult to cut the left side.
and remember, he's still holding the kid up...
by his hair.
what happened to him?
he said Rick was doing his thing in the ring when he saw a shadow come up behind him.
he turned, next thing he knows, he's being brought to by the E. M. T.
why not kill 'em both?
he didn't want both.
cutter, what's up? - l just got back from Clark's Gym.
Tommy Clark's body was thrown through the front window.
every bone in his body looked broken.
his face was barely recognizable.
what kind of doctor was this Cohen kid's father?
plastic surgeon.
this Cohen kid's father, he wasn't even on the football team.
excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but what do these killings have to do with football?
well, l mean, all the other fathers, they -- they played football.
did you know that?
no.
l -- l played high-school ball with them.
Yes. - Come on, Billie. Come on.
l realize it's bad.
the Clark boy too. Uh-huh.
where are we going?
first we go by the Tommy Clark crime scene.
then after school, we're gonna go see your friend Troy.
think we could get him to talk?
lf not, you're gonna need a whole lot more of this yellow tape.
Hey, what do you make of the mayor knowing all the fathers of the victims played football?
coincidence?
l don't believe in coincidence.
how do we play Troy?
you're the beauty pageant winner.
we're gonna use these good looks for the sake of the job.
leave the jacket in the car.
come here. Come over here.
act nice. Be a little bit more seductive.
come on.
there he is.
Hey!
please! Please don't -- don't hit me!
calm down, Troy. l'm not gonna hurt you.
please don't. - Troy, listen.
we just need help with a little something. Ain't that right, Billie?
that's right.
will you do that for me, Troy?
please?
good. What can you tell me about your friend?
you know, Troy, the one you're always talking to.
Oh, l don't know.
l don't know what you're talking about.
come on, Troy.
please tell Billie.
tell Billie all about him and l promise no one's gonna hurt you.

kids. You understand?
kids! - So were we!
we were just kids too.
what happened, Troy? Please tell us.
we were just playing army in our foxhole.
you and Rico were playing army?
then what happened, Troy?
Rico and l would always play together after school.
he's my best friend.
that's good. Real good.
after school, me and Rico would help his father clean up the funeral home.
and then you know, Mr. Volpe, he would let us play in the basement.
that's where our foxhole was.
ha ha! l'm killing all your guys!
what do you think of that? - Not all my guys.
what about my sniper?
we had so much fun.
that's good. - Then what happened, Troy?
did you two by accident start the fire?
no. No. We didn't start the fire.
they did! - Who, Troy?
who are they?
my bazooka guy's getting all your people.
here comes my sergeant.
me and Rico were playing in the basement when we heard them upstairs.
who's that? - l don't know.
Shh! Quiet. - You think it's burglars?
l don't know.
Hey!
what's going on, Rico? - What are you guys doing?
what's going on? Hey
what are you guys doing here? We're closed
lookie what we got here.
Where's your retard friend, huh?
Hey, what are you guys doing here? We're closed.
Oh, you are? Hey, guys, he says they're closed!

No! - Oh, you'll see what we're gonna do.
No! - Come on.

l couldn't open the casket.

Troy, oh my
Troy, if you could've, you would've.
you can help him now.
tell me who did this to him.
tell me. Please, Troy.
please, Troy, tell us.
l'll make sure no one hurts you.
come on, Troy. What do you want to show us?
they were the ones that did it, Troy?
the football players.
football here is so important they'd even cover up attempted murder?
l'm sure they didn't intend to start that fire.
they were probably just bullies out having some fun.
that casket door jammed and they panicked.
the Cohen kid -- he had to be the ballboy.
that's how he fits in.
he had a car.
they were friends with him because he had a car.
some things never fuckin' change.
the last one is Fred Hunter.
his kid's gotta be next.
his was first.
Holly Hunter was killed a few weeks ago in Jefferson County.
ls that it, Troy? ls that all of them?
that's all the circles, Troy. Who else was there?
lt's okay.
Billie, that's my son. When he came up here, he moved in with his aunt. He took her last name to fit in.
knock knock. Who's there?
your son was the one that locked Rico in the coffin.
my granddaughter Nikki.
that son of a bitch saved her for last! Let's go!
please don't hurt him! Please don't hurt him again!
he's my friend!
this is Detective Billie Vega.
l need all available units to meet me at -- Mike, what's the address?
there's no answer. - Mike?
926 Willow. - 926 Willow Street.
possible 10-13 in progress.
okay, so Rico gets out of the institution, comes back for revenge.
lnstead of taking it out on the guys that did it to him, he kills their kids.
ln a way that relates to their father's job.
just like they did to him.
What'd your son do before the accident?
nothing. He killed himself soon after he got married.
you said it was an accident. - l always thought it was...
until now.
we'll find Rico and stop him.
we will?
his sister said he died two weeks ago in the institution.
sister? - Don't ask.
knock knock.
why -- why are you doing this to me?
why are you doing this? Help!
Mrs. Reynolds! - Ruth!
Mrs. Reynolds! - Nicole!

supposedly, a dead man.
grandpa!
No!

l wasn't there for you or your father.
no no no. You were here when l needed you the most.

knock knock.
I have always been my own worst enemy
Oh, my God, you're so late
Hudson Milbank , God, you are so late
Hudson Milbank. You are so late
even on the most important day of my career
I felt overwhelmed by the uncertainty of what I had
I wasn't the same person anymore
I was now living in some kind of horrific perpetuaI dream state, yet somehow still able to interact without anyone knowing
just going through the motions, on automatic
I'm afraid I'll never get out of this
my life view was simple
one, I just wanted to be a happy person with happy thoughts
two, we were all a simple action away from complete disaster
you should slow down, man
but I didn't want to slow down
I just wanted to stop my racing thoughts, constant worry and never ending anxiety
little did I know, inhaling a harmless joint 12 times in 12 minutes could unhinge an already vulnerable brain and send it into the bottom of an abyss
Jesus Christ!
Jesus!
you just smoked too much Jesus Christ!
you'll be okay He'll be okay
I'm fucked!
from that point onward, I would suffer from a symptom so frightening, it would consume every minute of every hour of every day
the officiaI term was "depersonalization
no matter what I did, it wouldn't go away
so, what was it exactly?
depersonalization disorder, in brief, involved the persistent or recurrent experience of feeling detached, as if one was an outside observer of one's mentaI processes or body
are you okay?
the sense that the externaI world was unreaI or strange, like living in some hellish dream like state
in layman's terms, I was fucked
you hear that? - Yes, I did is that bad?
just hold your arms to your side
now touch your nose with your forefingers
all right, you can open your eyes now You're fine
that's impossible
I never joke about the head, son
my finger hit my nostril .Did you catch that?
it was close enough
but what about the "nothing's real" part?
perhaps you should see a psychiatrist or something
I also lived substantially below my means
not that I was cheap,
I was just terrified of things getting so bad, I wouldn't be able to function
so I opened up my checkbook, and found myself in the office of a West Side psychiatrist who specialized in dealing with creative types on the verge of losing their minds
have you ever heard the word "dysphoric"?
I knew it I've somehow gone crazy
no, that's psychotic
dysphoric is when you just don't feel right in your own skin
wait a minute, wait a minute. Say that again
over the next week, I couldn't stop talking about that word
it means I don't feel comfortable in my own skin
Tom was my writing partner of seven years
we complemented each other perfectly
he considered himself the writer of the team
I was the hustler
even in my state, I could sell better than he could
so, how's the detachment thing?
you could jam this fork into my eye socket right now and I wouldn't feel it
but you're gonna be okay for the pitch next week?
I'm suffering here
now, but this is important
why did I have to smoke the pot?
we have to sell something
I mean, I didn't even touch a drug in high school
see, when we're in the room, you're always the guy
so between now and then,
I'm really gonna need you to put down that fork
I couldn't have just taken one or two hits like a normal person
I had to smoke the whole thing like some fucking maniac
it's not the pot It's not the pot
I smoke pot every day of my life I've never stared at cutlery
do you have a turkey burger?
fuck!
all right
all right
what about the shrink? Is he any good?
he went to Harvard. Can't get any better than that
that's great. What's he say?
he thinks it might be a good idea for my self esteem if we switched the order of our names on every other screenplay
he's an asshole, a Harvard asshole
Oh, missed it on the high side, with the wind, with the slope
also, I watched The Golf Channel for 23 hours yesterday
why golf?
I don't know I find it comforting
it's green People are whispering
so you're not getting out at all?
look, I think this is something a little bit more than just being not comfortable in my own skin
what do I do? Tell me what to do
Hudson, it's important that you socialize, even if you have to force yourself
you are the sweetest dog So handsome
I read in a pamphlet from the NationaI MentaI Association that after 12 weeks of psychotherapy, if you're not better, seek another therapist
I was on week 14 with Dr Townshend, but we'd become more like friends, so I didn't mind
so, the "S," that's for Scott, right? -Yes
can I call you that? -No
one way to survive the endless time between therapy sessions was to distract myself with the longest running movies ever made
these are due back Thursday
what if I watch them all tonight?
okay
dr Townshend
wow, I can't believe I'm bumping into you. How are you?
fine
I was just at the video store
hey
well, I guess I'll go home and wait for our next appointment
it's tomorrow, right? -Fine
patient
the one thing Townshend did give me was clonazepam
the directions read, Take as needed
which for me was Monday to Friday and weekends
one blue pill was the equivalent of three domestic beers
two pills cut my feelings of hopelessness by a third
more was needed if you were, say, rejected by a shrink you entrusted your life to
I adored the sedation, but there was one drawback, sexuaI dysfunction
it got so bad, the average sexuaI act did nothing for me
I had to find the most extreme 20 seconds of footage and play it over and over untiI it did the trick
Oh, fuck me with your tongue
Oh, fuck me with your tongue
despite the restaurant snub,
I decided to give Dr Townshend another shot
after all, he was out with friends, and that had nothing to do with his dedication to me within our sessions
go on
I guess this is boring you
excuse me? You kind of fell asleep there
no- You were snoring
I was listening
because last night I was in the bath, and I figured out that I've already spent $2, 650 on sessions, and I still feel crazier than I ever did
so if you were snoring
I think you're making this bigger than it needs to be, Hudson
you would also think, at those kind of prices, if we ran into each other at a restaurant, you could acknowledge me as something more than "patient
perhaps we should talk about this - Perhaps
obviously, you're upset
I think I am a little upset because I rely on you
you're my touchstone to mental health, and I think we have kind of a bond
fuck me
intense exercise was my next course of action
I read if you could raise your endorphins high enough, it could somehow alter your brain chemistry
I found a class packed with lesbians, not by choice, but still, it was strangely comforting
okay, people!
this is your time, so let's push it!
that's it!
everybody up!
and everybody down
after 30 minutes, I thought something might actually be happening, but it was wishfuI, psychosomatic false alarm
my legs might as well have been attached to one of the lesbians
I didn't know where else to turn
I hadn't been home in five years
maybe a little family reconnection was what I needed to snap me back to normaI
now, what is this spaciness, sport?
it's anxiety. -That is all it is
Oh, my goodness
sport?
I desperately wanted my dad's help, but he was the king of pragmatic thinking
I'd get the same kind of advice to all my worries
do you think it was the pot?
I mean, why did I have to smoke so much?
just pull up your socks, huh? You'll be okay
I thought about reaching out to my older brother, Stan, who I'd worshipped since I was a kid
I'm busy
can I at least get a glass of water before I ride back?
I'm in the middle of a writing session. There's a gas station on the corner
sport? I can't I can't breathe
what is it? He says he can't breathe
Oh, for goodness' sake. Stop acting like a child!
breathe
hyperventilating
I think that's enough, sport
reconnecting wasn't the answer
I had to get back to LA and somehow heaI thyself
I know you're in there! Hudson, it's Tom!
come on, get up! Get up!
put those feet on the ground and move them!
that's it. Don't trip on your clothes, 'cause they're everywhere, aren't they?
that's me knocking! Answer the door! Open it!
okay, got to get you dressed. Got a meeting in 30
so when's the maid come? Never?
what do you think? Jeans and a T-shirt today?
I am dying here
all right, then I'll drive- I have to sleep
how about this shirt? Look at this.- Oh, my God
are you kidding me? I can't I can't do this
of course you can. The shirt goes on the top
watch this move
the pants, big surprise to everyone, go on the bottom
all right, we've got the leg crossed I crossed the pant
where are the shoes? Gotta have shoes You know why?
cause you're going outside. That's right
you are a handsome man I'm gonna wait in the car
we've got to get this job today, buddy Gotta get this job
so, how you doing now?
but that's better than in the car, right?
Oh, God!
can't you just fight this until after the meeting?
no, but I think I can mask it - Okay, that's all we need
he's ready for you
now would be good
sorry I'm late
fuck
fuck
for some reason, just looking at her jolted me into a state of awareness and back to the job at hand
so, would you like the $50 million version or the $100 million version?
you did it! You did it!
Oh, let's get something to eat
that girl is an angel
what? Who?
the development girl
Oh, no. No, no, no. Please, God, no
what? What?
remember the last gig? The copy girl?
the flower and the rain and the obsessing over her youthfuI zeaI?
we didn't work for a year after that
well, there's something different about this girl
all right, maybe there is
maybe there's something very different about this girl
it's just that there's also something very different about money coming in
okay?
okay Okay
fuck! Hello?
Hello?
is Hudson there?- Yes?
is this Hudson?
Yes, who's this?- Sara Harrison
who?
I was I was the executive
you were in my office today sucking up to my boss
Yes. Hi. This is him
I hope it's okay I'm calling- Yes, sure Of course
Hello? Hello?
I was wondering if you wanted to get together
you and me?- Uh huh
when?
just an ordinary everyday spoon. You've seen it a thousand times
just an ordinary piece of kitchen cutlery. See?
very impressive. Where did it go?- Well, it's magic
your lap?
it's a stupid trick, really
you know, I've seen you before, at a party a couple weeks ago
you were sitting on a couch by yourself, and this dog came up to you
you fed it a potato chip. Potato chip
yeah
you looked really lonely
Oh, no, that's just the way that I appear when I'm really enjoying myself
you seemed really anxious to leave
I did? Mmm
there was something so fucking noticeable about you
sorry Sweet
I cuss when I get excited about things-That's okay
it's not Tourette's or anything -Right
my God, she was fantastic
and by dessert, things loosened up when she started talking about her last relationship
so, he took a gun out of his glove compartment and then blew his brains out all over his Porsche, in front of his ex-wife
but she was obviously attracted to unstable guys, which was perfect
what's your biggest fear?
well, I guess I have two-Mmm hmm
the first is going spontaneously insane
and the second is something happening to my father
like him dying?
I really wish you, um, wouldn't say it
you're afraid of the word?
Yeah, for some reason, I think that saying it might
make it happen
yeah - It won't
death, death, death Die, die, die. See?
nothing
right, but you're saying it
nothing's gonna happen when you're saying it
see, that's the way my mind works
see, I figured out the other day that life expectancy for a male is 72 years
that's 25, 000 days
you know, and you sleep a third of that, so that's just 16, 000 days
and say you spend half that time trying to figure out what you want to do with your life
that's down to 8, 000 days
now, I'm 36, so that leaves me only 4, 311 days left, if I don't get sick or hit by a bus or something
you're an unusual person
my father is a physicist
he teaches string theory - That's interesting
Yeah, so's the affair he's having with a chick half his age
should I come in?
Oh, I would
what's the deal with him? He likes me
Really? - Yeah, he leaves CD's on my car and circles the tracks that remind him of me
people always look at the numbers changing
Yup
I think it's 'cause they're nervous - Yup
so, what did you think?
it sounds good - Seriously?
it's the worst playing of any musical instrument I've ever heard
really, you should throw that thing in the fireplace
Oh
where did you get all of this stuff?
what is that?
a turtle - It is?
Yeah, I broke its head off
I was watching the basketball playoffs, and my fucking team didn't win, and so I threw the remote control at the TV and it
headless
Yeah, I can see that You're insanely cute
you think I'm cute?
I kind of think I have a big head
Yeah, well, at least you have a chin I mean, look at this
I've got a straight line from my chin to my neck
it's like a chin-neck
well, I think that one of my ears is bigger than the other
I don't see that - Liars go to hell
Yeah, I see that
you really have no chin
well, you kind of look like a lion
well, you kind of look like an owl
an owl? - An owl without a chin
Oh, I have to go
where?
just I have an appointment tomorrow for something that I forgot
what kind of a deadbolt is this?
did I just fuck this up?
I'm gonna call you. So be ready for that
you do kind of look like an owl
so, you really like this girl, huh?
so, you must have told her you were depersonalized, yeah?
okay
how was that?
it was the worst lawn bowling I've ever seen in my entire life
I think you should take the ball and throw it in my fireplace
over the next few dates, she was able to drag me outside during the day
luckily, we did things almost as comforting as The Golf ChanneI
nights were the worst for me, so I convinced her to stay in and watch extended versions of Lawrence of Arabia,
bridge on the River Kwai and The Right Stuff, which we saw twice
she seemed perfectly fine
at this rate, I could stay in my comfort zone indefinitely
I think we should go out tonight
out? Hmm
but I thought we were gonna watch the Star Wars trilogy with the commentary
I know Watching the Star Wars trilogy with the commentary's fun, but I was thinking that maybe we could do something different
so even though the Millennium Falcon was the oldest plane, it ended up saving all of them
Yeah, it did, yeah
I'm thinking about getting a new car, by the way
Really? Why?
well, I just don't want you to think that I like driving something that's 10 years old
a lot of people in LA don't have insurance, so they don't care if they crash into you so
you don't have to impress me, Hudson
I know
and I am looking at homes- Hmm
let's go there
you okay? - Yeah You?
yeah
that's impressive
I think you should give her $5
$5? - Yup
I only have a 20 - I'll pay you back
you should wash your hands
that's good
I'm gonna go get some hand sanitizers
okay
why do they have locks on stores that are open 24
do you steal a lot?
what stealing? - The pen
no, I paid for that - Don't lie
fucking hate that
why do you do it?
I don't know - Yeah, you do
well, maybe it gives me a warped sense of control or some adrenaline or
because I got to tell you, Hudson, I can't date somebody who does that
well, it's only small stuff
it doesn't matter. It's not right
I know - Do you?
Yes, and it will absolutely not happen again
you're just saying that to get off the hook
you returned it?
like it never happened
thank you, Hudson
no, thank you - Stealing is bad and I don't want to be bad
you do you realize we haven't had sex yet
uh, yes, I am aware of that
will you take me back to your place?
mine?
it's kind of like a ski lodge
ha! It is very chalet like
you rent this place? - I do pay a monthly fee
whoa, what the fuck was that? - Oh, no, you're
you're okay -There's just a family of squirrels
can I get you anything?
what you got?
um
well, I have pasta I don't have any sauce
but would you like me to make you some pasta?
that's really sweet We just ate so
how about some bottled water?
Oh, okay, here's the deal with that
I don't really keep bottled water in the house 'cause. I believe that it's a scam
see, tap water has to undergo much more stringent testing for bacteria
tap's good
Hudson, what are you looking for in a relationship?
Oh, well, just basically, somebody who can stand to be with me, I guess
here - Thank you
you?
well,
I want to know that if my limbs fall off, we'd still be together, no matter what
and when he says my name, it sounds different in his mouth
you know, like it's safe there
or
I put on perfume and he puts on cologne, and we go out, and we can smell each other
you know, they make you smile when you're tired
that's a big one
or you tell them something that you're scared to tell them because you're afraid it'll make them stop loving you
but when you tell them, you're surprised, because it actually, it makes them love you more
or you tell them that they
that you love their shirt, and then they end up wearing it every day
my greatest example of this is my grandparents
my grandmother has arthritis in her hands, and she can't bend down and paint her toes
so my grandfather does it for her, all the time
even though he has arthritis in his hands, too
so, do you like the place?
I like you
what are you doing?
you can't sleep?
you wanna turn You can turn on the TV
is that good?
that's great
how many girls could fall asleep to the Greater Hartford Open?
maybe a lot, but this was the first one I ever met
go, go, go
and I never want to see you back here ever again!
do you understand?
I couldn't hide my condition from her forever
if I had any chance with Sara, I had to speed up my recovery
so I went with another doctor who specialized in a big word, which meant, "Fuck talking, take drugs
uh So, Dr
Richmond - Richmond, here's the thing
I have met and, I think, fallen in love with the most beautiful, incredible, weird woman on the face of the planet
she's so pretty
I mean, she thinks she has a big head, but she doesn't
and last night we consummated our relationship, which is to say that I had sex Well, we had sex and
it should have felt really good I mean, it should have felt really good
but I was so focused on her not seeing the pen that I stole, which she saw me steal
but I told her that I returned it, but I didn't return it
I just stole another pen
so all that was flying through my brain when I was supposed to
so, fucking help
help Fuck, help
on a crowded elevator, do you stand at the back or the front?
what?
on a crowded elevator, do you stand at the back or the front?
back
front Front
front
although, sometimes I find myself looking up at the numbers 'cause I get nervous
you ever hear voices coming from your television set?
that aren't part of the show?
yes - No
I think we'll begin with divalproex sodium
what's divalproex sodium? - Technically, an antipsychotic
psychotic? I'm psychotic? - No
because I feel psychotic, sometimes
the fact that you're asking the question proves that you're not
well, then why am I taking psychotic medication?
because in small doses it can be quite helpful with mood, which I think is contributing to your problem
but I thought that's why I was on clonazepam
did someone from Harvard prescribe that?
yes
idiots. You'll stop that immediately
well, is this gonna help with my depersonalization?
that's what we're gonna find out
well, what about the side effects? - Nothing to be concerned about
have you taken an antipsychotic before?
no, I'm not psychotic
I already asked if I was psychotic, and apparently that proves I'm not psychotic
I'm taking it for depersonalization
are you aware of the side effects?
I was told there's nothing to be concerned about
Hudson READING: "Blurred vision, constipation, dry eyes, "dry nose, dry mouth, difficulty urinating
nothing to be concerned about "Tardive dyskinesia
tardive dyskinesia, a permanent twitching of the facial muscles
fuck
my alternatives were slim
permanent spaciness or rare, irreversible faciaI twitching
give it another hour, sport
I'll leave the back door unlocked Okay, Dad
where have you been?
what? Here - I've been calling and calling
what time is it? - It's almost 4: 00
I fell asleep
I fell asleep in the bathroom
you fell asleep in the bathroom
Hudson, what's going on?
nothing
Hudson, tell me what's going on - Nothing
I want to know
the technical term for it is "depersonalization"
but I can't explain to you what that is because you don't have it
can you please try?
it's like when I feel anxious, which is all the time, my relationship with reality is all screwed up
so
like, I look at my hand and it just doesn't feel
like, right now, I see your lips moving and I hear you talking, but it just doesn't feel real to me
I don't feel real to you?
this all started with the pot
do you think it was the pot?
no, I don't think pot can do that, baby
Yeah, and I didn't want to tell you because I didn't think you'd want to be with me
have you seen anybody about this?
I've seen almost everybody about this
what do they say? - They give me pills, but I don't think I'm taking the right ones because they just make me feel worse
do you ever feel better?
4: 45 am, and for the next 20 minutes, the only time in this city's day when it is completely deserted
I feel like we're the last people on earth
I wish it was like this all the time
you can't live like this
sometimes I wish I didn't
and I don't think you understand what he's going through
I'm afraid for him
let me put your mind at ease
people who talk about killing themselves very rarely carry it out
Oh, really?
because I dated a guy who talked about it all the time, and then he blew his fucking brains out
Hudson, if you don't mind,
I'd like to speak to Sara alone for a few minutes
what I'm interested in is why you're here
because I care about him - Why?
because he does stupid magic tricks
because you can't pick who you fall in love with
I would never let a girl go to my shrink
you should have seen her. She was amazing
she completely defended me. She really put him in his place
well, she knows too much about you now
so?
well, I'd just be concerned that she'd use it against me
for what?
like a trump card
whenever she wants, boom, she's got that
no, Sara would never do that
okay
you know what? Okay
she sounds great
want to get some work done for a few hours?
yeah - Great
Yeah, we can do that
after the first round of individuaI drug trials failed,
dr Richmond decided to bombard all my neurotransmitters at once
so we combined everything
sertraline, bupropion, MAO inhibitors, fluoxetine hydrochloride
it was like musicaI drugs, and when the music stopped, I couldn't get a chair
I became numb to the labels
I just wanted relief
good luck with this one, Hudson - Thanks, Rick
we have to turn this off
just one more tournament
how's your reality system now?
Hey, let's
let's get married
what? - Let's get married
you're serious? - Yeah
Hudson, marriage is a motherfucker of a responsibility
I know
and a lot of work - I know
you're not ready to get married
Yes, I am
and I want kids, you know, someday
you think you can do that? - Yes
you don't? - I didn't say that
I just think that maybe right now isn't a good time to be talking about marriage, when you're going through this
this thing - Yeah, you can say it
fucked up state of mind that nobody seems to have a clue what to do with
but I think you're gonna work yourself through it
well, what if I don't?
you will
right, but what if I don't?
what if this is the way I'm gonna be for the rest of my life?
but I don't think that's the case I
you just need to stop being so - What?
negative
negative? - Yeah
negative Well, I'm sorry if the rest of the world was born with perfect brain synapses and is walking around in la-la land, and I can't tell if this fucking flower is real!
if you are just waiting around for me to get better
this is it
this is it
Tom was right
in the best of worlds, all I could bring her was unending grief and the need for constant reassurance that I wouldn't lose my mind
it would only be a matter of time before she couldn't take it anymore
self-sabotage the best thing in my life?
of course I would
ready?
what?
you told me you weren't gonna do this again
I didn't - Stop it
stop what?
I know what you're trying to do. Please don't
what? What am I trying to do? - You promised
look, this is me, all right? It's just me
that's such a crock of shit
you want to end this?
you think you're so irre fucking deemable?
then end it
come on, tell me it's over
but you have to say it
fuck! Fuck
did you not hear me say that she would?
she didn't do anything I did this
I fucked this up Me
okay
okay, then, just go apologize
no, she deserves a normal person, not some kleptomaniac freak show who's gonna ask her to marry him
all right All right, what you need now is a different kind of woman
why, so I can just play this shit out again?
no, no, no. Stay with me
Ah, there she is Look over there
attractive, clearly a different woman
just go over there and talk Huh?
I can't
look at me
who's your best friend? - Dave Wilson
in this city
you - Thank you. Trust me, okay?
you're hurting I get that
this is the best and easiest way
just go over and talk. No proposals
do not mention The Golf Channel Just talk to her
okay, she's on the move. Make your move Now
go - She's going to the bathroom
perfect! Go Go, go, go
you are not gonna believe this She's a doctor
she specializes in cognitive behaviorism
that's incredible, and she's hot
cognitive behaviorism
the deaI was you could change the way you felt by altering your negative thinking
would it work? I highly doubted it - But, my God, she was qualified
a tenured professor at UCLA, a Master's in psychology from Stanford, another from Cambridge, published books on anxiety, articles in prestigious medicaI journals
exactly what I needed
when you say, "I hate myself for blowing it with the woman of my dreams
that's an example of magnification
a better way to express it would be, "At the moment, I'm disappointed that we're no longer together, "but many relationships don't work out "What can I do to change my behavior next time?
are you married?
another area we'll work on is labeling
right, but is there a Mr Dr Blaine?
I don't think that's really important to your treatment
where are you from? - We're not here to talk about me
okay
but it's Texas, right?
Arkansas
okay?
unlike most therapists, who would never think of leaving the comfort of their offices,
dr Blaine actually took her patients into the field
I can't
there is absolutely no connection between saying a word and the health of your father
but why tempt fate?
because it will lower your anxiety and help you get better
all right, give me a second
you can do this, Hudson
death
it worked. He's okay. He's trimming the hedges
see?
has a patient ever asked you out before?
it happens
do you ever say yes? - Never
how about dinner with me?
I don't think so
because we have a professional relationship?
exactly
well, what if I stopped seeing you?
I don't think that would be wise
right, but what's the rule on that kind of thing?
you're very sweet, Hudson, but my only concern is that you get better
is that why you blushed back there?
as a way to recovery, Dr Blaine thought it a good idea to e-maiI me cognitive exercises
I could practice outside our sessions
first assignment, monitor my daily negative thoughts
hello - Hudson, it's Dr Blaine
are you busy?
no, I'm just doing a little cognitive homework
good
well, the reason I'm calling is that I found a very interesting article on cortisoI levels
I think may be of some help
you may want to take a look at it
Really? In fact, I have it with me now
Yes, absolutely
it explains how high cortisol levels increase adrenaline, which could have a bearing on the feeling of depersonalization
interesting
so I'll do some more reading over the weekend
I hope I didn't make you drive too far
no, my shack is only about five minutes away
shack?
well, I'm sure it's not a shack
my God
it is a shack
Yeah, it's the only place I feel even close to okay
almost like a sanctuary
I'm so sorry this is happening to you - Thanks
it's not fair - Thank you
and I did blush
I knew it
I just think, therapeutically, it's important to bring it out in the open
I do find you very charming, attractive and funny
but things as they are, nothing can ever happen on that level
I'm sorry
the door Sticks
bullshit - She said it was the first time she'd had sex in seven years
bullshit - It was like having a wounded animal on top of me
that is so wrong - Well, what do I do?
isn't it obvious? Try to see her without having to pay
hi Yeah Let me get two of the chocolate things there
it is absolutely my fault Inexcusable
I want you to know that I have spoken to a colleague to find someone to take over your sessions
who can make me say "death"?
there is no other way here
I could lose my license
I can't see another therapist It has to be you
Hudson, a terrible line has been crossed
can't we just forget about what happened?
you could do that?
yes
the first time was exciting
now having her writhe all over me,
I realized I was letting her use me, so I could use her, so she'd work harder at making me better
I had become a cognitive whore
dr Blaine here again
if we could talk before noon, Hudson, that would be good for me
Hey, it's Tom. I'm here writing and you're not
that's okay. Just another reminder, we've got our biggest pitch ever next week, so
head of production, that kind of a guy Chance of a lifetime, partner
just need you firing all selling cylinders. Call me
Hudson, it's Dr Blaine again
call me at home when you can
I hope I haven't filled up your machine
the machine is full
so, is it this, prune juice and then death?
is that the trifecta?
seriously, are you still banging that shrink?
I'm afraid to break it off
she's doing all this extra research for me
she's even canceling her appointments with other patients
this could get bad - Hudson
Oh, God - It got bad It got bad
I think we should have some lunch
what do I do?- Have lunch Have lunch
I thought it would be safer to say what I'm about to say in public
obviously, something has happened to my emotions
my behavior has been Fuck off!
unacceptable
well, that can happen - No, it can't
did you witness my tone with the waiter just then?
I did catch that, yeah
it has to stop, Hudson Us, we, this
I agree
I was up all night analyzing my actions, berating myself, abhorring myself
I go to sleep that way every night so
thank you for saying that - Sure
I suppose I have spent so many years listening to other people's feelings that I've neglected my own
and it's all coming out now, here, in the restaurant, in front of all these people?
which is something I have to deal with, and I will deal with
Oh, I feel so much better
Oh, my God, even my hunger is back
Oh, well, the tuna melt looks good
it's no good I love you, Hudson
what? - I love you!
Oh, God. Oh, God
I am so sorry I didn't mean to raise my voice like that
I thought you I thought you were dealing with it
I am, I am It's just I cannot get you out of my mind
sure you can Sure you can
look at me, I'm a mess
you don't want that I'm flattered that you think that you have these feelings
no, no, I don't think I have them
fifteen years of cognitive training,
I might just know a little something about feelings
Oh, God
God, what is wrong with me?
I'm acting like an insane person - No
forgive me? - Yes
will you forgive me? - Yes
I think we should go - Sure
but first, may I just ask one question?
why don't we wait till we get out of the restaurant?
no, no, no. Need to know now
do you think, under different circumstances, you would feel the same way about me?
I think you need to calm down
calm down? Oh
I think I know how I am
and I certainly know how you are
a walking generalized anxiety disorder with rapid cycling issues, precipitous abandonment, a tendency toward hypomania, possibly, who's magnifying all over the place!
I love you!
run
it just occurred to me, I haven't even met your family
so, how'd it go with the therapist?
mr Milbank? This is the office of Professor Paula Simon,
mount Sinai SchooI of Medicine
we received your inquiry regarding your depersonalization study, and a spot has become available
please contact us at your convenience
dr Paula Simon was the only doctor in North America researching depersonalization specifically, but I was determined to get through the four-day intensive, no matter what
Plus, it would be a relief to finally meet other depersonalized people as I was beginning to think I was the only one
where are the others? - Others?
other crazy test patients like me?
it's just you this weekend, sweetheart
I'll draw your blood every hour on the hour for 72 hours
you're kidding
you know, it's funny Everyone says that
you'll see Dr Simon on Sunday
I'm the most selfish person in the world
I blew the best thing that ever happened to me because I was afraid
I'll see you in an hour
count backwards from 2, 004 in groups of seven
if you make a mistake, begin again
have any of you guys ever slept with a patient?
all my attention should have been at the tests at hand, but for the first time, I wasn't thinking about my condition at all
it was just Sara
you have depersonalization disorder
well, I know that
how do I get rid of it? - We don't know at this time
well, you have to. There's a great girl involved here
I've heard
what about the pot? - Triggered what was already there
it probably would have happened eventually
but not definitely?
based on our current research, there was more than likely a predisposition there
so, what do I do?
there are medications, I've taken them all
and therapies, I've done them
then I suggest you try to accept it
you suggest I try to accept it?
I do know of an excellent cognitive behaviorist at UCLA who's proven helpful 42 feet of cubic space back here
you won't find that in a Mercedes, I'll take it
very bright and airy, beautiful backyard, stunning hardwood floors
a very pretty yard, I'll take it
Oh, good, Tim Tim, where is she? - She's gone
what? - She left with some guy
Where?- Maui
look, an airport cab came to pick her up two hours ago
does that help? Which airline?
I'm only doing this because I dislike him more than I dislike you
which airline?- Delta
you'll be towed!
hold on just a second
Hudson, what are you doing here? - Don't do this
this guy can't make you swear the way I can
go home- Home to what?
you're the only one I can be myself around
you're the only one I can be comfortable with
I bought a new house and a car and I'm getting a smaller TV
Hudson, it's not about a house or a car or a TV
okay, how about this? I love you
don't say that
you could save me and you won't even try
Sara
let's go
fuck
hello
can we talk?
I'm busy
our dad just died and you're doing business on the phone?
it's nothing It's just my brother. Go ahead
you wanna get off the phone?
what the hell is wrong with you?
Hudson?
what are you doing?
nothing
what happened with you and your brother?-It doesn't matter
that's what he said. You ought to be downstairs with the others
would you stop that?
would you stop that?
God damn it!
what is wrong with you?
why have you always been so angry at me?
are you kidding?
you know, they say the first three years of a child's life are the most essential
I'm just curious, were you bouncing me on my head during that time?
I'd really like to know how I turned out this way
well, it wasn't easy for me, either, Hudson
do you have any idea what a selfish boy you were?
I was a kid. Kids are supposed to be selfish
okay, fine
I was a terrible mother! Is that what you wanna hear?
Yeah, that's what I wanna hear!
I just
I always
of all the children, I thought that you and I, we're the most alike
well, that's certainly true
maybe I wasn't as nurturing as I should have been
well, that must have been really hard for you to say
my theory was simple
if smoking marijuana triggered my problems, smoking even more would reverse it, shocking my synapses back to normaI
there was no science behind this, just gut feeling mixed with sheer desperation
was I scared? Absolutely
would it work? It had to
you're okay
is that all you got?
is that all you got?
God, no
I needed a quick fix of manic adrenaline, to snap me back into a semblance of reality
hell, I deserved it, and I knew just the remedy
what are you staring at?
probably best to keep it low-key around here
so, what did you do?
shoplifted a pair of Aerosoles
good shoe
what did you do?
nothing
well, they don't like that
Hey, it's gonna be okay - No, it's not
I miss Sara
I don't think I can be a writer anymore, and I am completely alone
do I look familiar to you?
I've passed you and your dog outside the grocery store a hundred times
a hundred times, and I never gave you anything
I know
look, I'll wait here with you
so, is that real enough for you?
maybe Dr Simon was right
maybe I had a predisposition all along
the pot was just an easy excuse to pin it on
and maybe it was just me
I was my problem
maybe my dad had it right
just pull up my socks and get out of my own way
Hi. Hello
I'm here to tell you that I love you
now, even though I know you're gonna say, "Yeah, so?"
I still love you
okay
see you - Yup
Hudson, I think you're making a big mistake
we need to have a session to discuss you ending your sessions
this is your brain chemistry talking
there are new medications coming out all the time
this should square us up
this your first time?
I'll wait with you
Oh, my God, you're so late
Hudson Milbank. God, you are so late
Hudson Milbank. You are so late
sorry I'm late - No problem
we understand that you can buy in the room, and my partner is very excited about that
so excited that we've worked really hard for the last couple of weeks to come up with something great for you here today
well, that's not tru.e He's been working really hard
see, he's the writer. He's a really good writer
the only thing I'm really good at is bullshitting all of you guys, and that's just not enough for me to be good at anymore, so I'm gonna go
Yeah, I'm gonna go. Tom will take this home for you
I'll put your name first
you know you can do this
do you need validation?
you want to hear the $50 million version or the $100 million version?
there you go, guys. They were out of organic bananas
thanks
so, how's Sara?
she's
right there She's right there
are you okay? - I'm great
hi
God, hi
how are you?- I'm good
good
how are you? - I'm good
good. I'm better
I mean, I'm not ever gonna be normal
I'm still gonna be much more comfortable at 4: 45 on the corner of Ventura and Woodman
Hey, look, I don't wanna hold you up
I just want to let you know that if you lost all your limbs, we'd still be together forever
I mean, I really hope that doesn't happen because I think your limbs are pretty great
and when I said your name, it would always sound safe
I'm not sure about the perfume and the cologne thing, but I could try, you know
I mean, I could pick some up
I would always try to make you smile when you're tired
I know you think that's really hard to do, but I think I could do that
and you'd never have to be scared to tell me anything
and if you like this shirt,
I wouldn't take it off for a month
and I'd be more than willing to paint your grandmother's toenails so your grandfather doesn't have to do it anymore
you don't have to save me, Sara
but I am gonna love you for the rest of my life, so things would be a lot better for me if you were around
okay
what's happening to me?
I believe that we have been chosen to rebuild this community as we rebuild ourselves.
some of us will rise to the challenge. Others won't.
if the military is working on something secret down here,
I want to know about it.
I went out on a limb for you.
if you want to be a good reporter, talk to me.
just don't tell anyone you're doing it.
you have all been given a second chance on life, and I encourage you not to squander it.
Tom, what the hell does that mean?
what is happening to all these people?
we will all ultimately survive.
man, it's hot. How do I get a transfer to glacier national park?
Oh, yeah. I could just see you up there tagging grizzlies.
just gets hotter out here every year.
we're getting close.
well, hello, Boris.
do you see him?
Yep.
looks like he made it through the storm safe and sound.
still tagged, still fat and happy.
Hey, Russ.
check it out!
Auxilio!
Auxilio!
Ayudame, por favor!
Auxilio.
Ayudame.
Estan perdidos todos.
all right. Here you go, sir. Just have a seat.
no pude salvar a mi familia.
there you go.
what did he say? Did he lose his family in the hurricane?
que paso? Perdiste tu familia en el huracan?
...es de havana.
he came from havana.
Anoche vio las luces.
he saw lights?
Luces?
eran luces en el agua?
lights in the water?
y despues?
no pude salvar a mi familia.
no pude salvar a mi familia.
what did he say?
he couldn't save his family.
okay, Roosevelt, this is the last bag of ice we have before Jesse brings us some more, okay?
okay.
there you go, you want to try, uncle Dave?
Mnh-mnh. No, thanks. I don't want to lose my natural musk.
Hey. You ready for my presentation?
Yeah, I kinda gotta work, Dave.
this is about your work.
this is where Russell and i spotted our first E. B.E.
what does that mean?
that is an extraterrestrial biological entity.
Russell thinks it's a fish.
okay, we'll pretend it's a fish.
this is Russell's ranger station, okay?
this is where he found that bloody air force guy Paxton.
this is key largo.
you saw downed helicopter wreckage, dead flyers, a hazmat team and a titanium box being loaded onto the back of a semi.
Yeah, and I saw a hundred more boxes just like it at the air base, and people may be following me as a result.
and Underlay told you that the helicopter was searching for a missing weather plane, right?
right. - Right!
then this is your story.
weather plane goes down during a hurricane.
search and rescue helicopter goes out to find it.
they lower Paxton into the water.
boom! He's he's immediately attacked by a school of... fish.
hearing all this over the radio, the air force sends out their cleanup crew.
shocked, they find a dead orange fish at the scene, and they immediately lock it into a titanium box
they very same titanium box that you saw being loaded into the truck.
how do we know that these boxes aren't just holding weather plan wreckage?
hmm?
I've had a minute to think about it, too.
maybe we're all just getting ahead of ourselves.
the air force doesn't generally advertise when they lose a plane.
maybe that's their big secret--they lost a plane.
so, uh, so these guys are following you because they think you have a tray table?
I'm not sure anyone was following me.
it could have been your paranoia rubbing off.
Oh, yeah, that's...
Hey, daddy!
Hey, Rose.
Hey! You're home early.
Yeah, well, I'm not staying long.
I just need to pick up some supplies.
supplies for what?
fishing trip.
how can frozen water be so heavy?
do you want to stop by the hospital and say hi to your mom?
Nah. She'll be busy.
I know she misses you, Jess.
Whoa!
Hey, Marcia and Greg.
you guys need a lift? - No.
come on. You're gonna melt.
what do you want, Derek?
just a sense of fulfillment, of helping other human beings.
that's all. - Go away.
that's not what you said the other night at the bonfire.
okay, fine.
wait.
no, it's okay. There's something Derek and I need to settle.
sweet.
stop acting like we slept together.
you embarrassed?
if I'd actually had sex with you, I'd be embarrassed.
I mean, the night's a bit of a haze, but I think I'm remember something like that.
Kira, totally straight
I woke up that morning feeling like I've never felt before.
really. Supercharged.
and the last thing I remember was kissing you.
Yeah, right.
no, I'm serious.
it was amazing.
you were amazing.
Whoo!
they'll probably let you off with a warning once they find out who my father is.
right.
but in this case, that might not help.
what's the hurry, son?
Hello, honey.
Hey, dad.
Hello, sir.
have we met before?
dad, he's been over to the house.
wait in my car for me, honey.
dad!
I'd like to talk to this young man alone.
I'm not going to give you a ticket, son.
thank you, sir.
but I am going to give you a warning.
okay.
I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
sir, I
Hey, she's not your type. - Oh, we're just friends, sir.
well, I'm sure you have other friends.
and if you don't, I'll be happy to find some for you...
just not my daughter.
what are you doing here?
what do you mean, what am I doing here?
I wanted to see you.
how did you get in?
hopped the fence.
I'm sorry about my dad. That was so lame.
no biggie. It happens.
what did he say?
he said I had, um, I had good taste.
no, he didn't.
so you gonna invite me in?
what if he comes home?
does he ever come home during the day?
your father said I wasn't your type.
he did?
Hey, Kira!
get in the closet.
the closet?
Kira? Oh.
hi...
I'm sorry.
uh, what are you doing home so early?
well, I finished my rounds early today. You okay?
Yeah. Um, I was just resting.
Oh. Okay.
well, I just wanted to check in.
I'm going to take a quick bath and then go to my meeting.
but I'll be home early, so I'll make us all dinner.
okay? - Great.
will you set the table? - Sure.
okay.
well, I guess I'll see you later then.
right. I'll see you later.
sorry. My stepmom's been trying to do this dinner thing, like, for a long time.
it was hot in there, right?
it's hot everywhere.
look, I, um...
look, I think I should go.
Oh, no, no. You're not going anywhere.
this doesn't feel right.
sorry, Kira.
it felt right a minute ago.
what's wrong with you?
I think your dad was right.
you're not my type.
soon as I catch one of these things.
where you guys going, anyway?
just a little fishing trip.
he's going to look for the lights.
you are?
Yeah.
well, can I come? - No.
why not? - Because, Jess, it's just not safe.
well, why is it safe for you?
dad, I'm not a little kid anymore, you know?
I can help you out.
that's kind of why I'm here, to help you out.
Russell, if he's going, I'm definitely going.
why don't you l go?
you can take care of each other.
don't kill it, daddy.
just catch it.
before the hurricane, the biggest challenge I faced was whether to give somebody a crew cut or a trim.
and the only person I ever thought of...
the only person I even worried about was me.
and I was alone.
now I don't remember exactly what happened the night eve hit.
but I do know that something washed that man away.
because the man you see before you now, the man who survived that night knows his life has just begun.
I come in here, and meeting all of you and hearing all of your stories,
I've realized that the only way to truly move ahead is to do it with all of you.
I'm just grateful that I'll never have to be alone again.
that was cool, huh?
I'm Derek.
I'm Mariel.
I know who you are. I've seen you with Kira.
right. Yeah, we have a couple classes together.
well, I mean, we did, when there was school.
right.
Hey, these meetings are really great, hmm?
I, uh...
is this your first one, or have you--you keep coming back, or you've been at a couple?
actually, this is my third.
but I plan on coming to as many as I can.
Yeah. Yeah, me too.
what was your experience?
if you don't mind me asking.
no. Um...
during the hurricane, I was fine.
but almost a week after, something happened, and I, uh...
well, I haven't been the same.
this is gonna sound really weird, but do things feel different to you now?
like water...
water feels completely different to me now.
it's almost...almost like velvet.
you know, I should be getting home, Derek.
Yeah. Sure.
thanks for listening. - Sure.
I mean, it's the first time I've told anyone about any of this.
so...
it helps to talk about it, doesn't it?
Yeah. A lot.
um, can I...
can I talk to you again sometime?
you know, about...about all this stuff?
of course. Anytime.
right. Thank you.
higher, Larkin!
higher?
looks to me like you're going pretty high already.
please? Just one more higher?
okay. There you go!
Hey, Rose?
let's play something else.
let's play hide and go seek.
I want you to count to 100 and then find a really good hiding place in the house, okay?
and then, after 100, I'll come find you.
okay.
okay? One.
who are you?
stop.
Russ, why does this area look so familiar?
this is where that plane went down.
what plane?
there was a crash here in '96.
I was part of the search and rescue team.
was that the one with Kira's mom?
Yeah.
how did Tom live through that?
what, Kira's dad was on that flight, too?
Yeah. He was the only one who survived.
everyone knows that. - I didn't.
so how'd he make it, dad? - I don't know.
I remember reading something about him being trapped in an air pocket.
"Underlay's miracle in mud," they called it.
no wonder the guy's so full of himself. He's invulnerable.
Hey, Jess, slow down.
what is it?
what do you got?
that's it. That's one of them.
there's one. Jesse, get the net.
no, Jesse, hold on. Hold on!
where did it go?
I think it's under the boat.
what? - shh! Don't move.
there it is! There it is!
follow it! Follow it! Follow it, follow it, follow it!
looks really good, honey.
well, you might want to taste it first.
I met a friend of yours today--Derek.
where did you meet him?
at our support group.
I guess he's been having a rough time lately.
since when?
he hasn't told you? - No.
but we're not really that close.
at least, not anymore.
well, that's too bad.
he seems kind of lonely.
how do you know?
I could just tell, talking to him.
why were you talking to him?
cause he's been having a rough time.
Wow.
what?
the kid is something.
you don't even know him, dad.
I'm getting to know him.
well, hopefully the group will help.
Oh, I'm sure he's just gonna blossom.
what is wrong with you?
dad doesn't like Derek.
no, dad knows Derek.
dad knows Derek all too well.
looks like it's slowing down.
cut the engine, Dave. - Why I don't i see any lights?
just cut the engine.
is it still there?
Yeah. - Okay, on three.
one... two... three.
I got it. You got it? You got it?
come on.
here we go. I got it. Come on!
damn it, Russ!
is it gone? Did we lose it?
no, it's still there.
I don't understand it.
Russ, Russ, Russ! It's getting away!
Russ, hold on. Hold on! Hold on!
it's getting away!
no more shooting, Russ! You don't wanna shoot it!
jeez, I think you just missed it, dad.
I don't think so.
did you tag it? That was a tag?
it's not going anywhere without us.
you tagged it.
what are you doing here? - Just hanging out.
why don't you hang out somewhere else?
I'm not interested in your daughter anymore, sir.
I know that.
but the person you are interested in...
she's not available.
I don't know what you're talking about.
my wife told me you joined her group.
you choose all your wife's friends?
let me explain something to you, son.
I understand how you feel.
I understand it better than anyone because I've lived with the feeling far longer than anyone you'll ever meet at that support group.
but let me tell you something else, and this is the really important part.
you don't matter to me at all.
you have zero value in my life.
and where Mariel's concerned, the only value that you could ever have is by causing me problems.
and that's not something you want to do.
inhalation therapist to C. C.U.
inhalation therapist to C. C.U.
Hi. Do you know where I can find dr. Underlay?
you need to go to admitting.
no, no, I need to find dr. Underlay.
yes?
Oh, my god.
how'd you do this?
I was, um...
I was trying to unscrew a light bulb.
so you're going to the meeting tonight?
hmm, I think so. - Yeah.
would you mind giving me a lift?
well, you know, I just don't think I should drive.
we should have found it by now.
we will. We just have to be patient.
as long as there's a signal, we'll catch up to it.
Hey, dad, what happened to that old Cuban guy you found?
Yeah, what's up with him? You send him back to Havana?
no, Mona took him down to the border patrol.
is he gonna be able to stay here?
I don't know if he'll want to.
you did.
well, my situation was very different.
what situation?
dad came here in the boatlift in 1980 when he was only 10 years old...
by himself.
what about your folks?
they were supposed to be on the next boat.
there wasn't one.
What'd you do? - Waited.
Yeah, and?
waited.
this is just like "deliverance.
let's hope not.
Hey, you know, if we don't find the one we tagged, what do you say, Russ?
you want to head out into deeper water tomorrow?
maybe there's an E. B.E. Mothership out there
Hey, Dave, why don't we just stop with that alien nonsense now, okay?
that E. B.E. Word
why don't you lose it?
it's not a word. It's an acronym.
your father is afraid of the unexplained, Jesse.
no, his father just doesn't need you explaining.
how about when we find one of these things, we let science give us an explanation?
you know, every scientist thought the world was flat until one lone visionary proved them wrong.
one. - Which visionary?
Chris Columbus
famed explorer and director of "home alone."
aristotle proved the world round.
and he was seconded by the likes of Roger bacon and Thomas Aquinas.
Columbus--he just go lost.
but he still managed to wipe out countless native Americans along the way.
okay, fine, both you guys mock me all you want.
when the invaders come a-prodding, you guys are both gonna know the true meaning of "squeal like a pig.
the tall black figure was coming her way.
he was keeping very close to the houses across the street, hiding in the shadowy places where there was no moonlight.
on and on it came, nearer and nearer...
you said this was scary.
it's not scary.
it seems scary to me.
on and on it came, nearer and nearer.
but it was moving in spurts.
it would stop, and then it would
and then it would move on.
and then it would stop
what is it?
is everything okay, Larkin?
dad?
Hey, Jess.
why aren't you sleeping?
I don't know.
why aren't you?
just thinking about stuff.
Yeah, me, too.
Dave doesn't seem to have a problem.
why do you think it's so important for him that there be extraterrestrials?
isn't there enough weird stuff on this planet?
Yeah, I guess he just hates the idea that we could be alone.
well, we're not alone.
have you ever really tried to find out what happened to your parents?
sure.
And?
it's Cuba, son. It's a brick wall.
and they were dissidents.
was it scary for you when you first came out here?
of course.
thanks for letting me come out here with you, dad.
you're welcome.
think you're really gonna be able to bring one of these things home alive?
we'll see.
it may not be so easy.
it looked pretty big.
did your mom ever mention to you that she saw one - when she was in the water? - No.
think that's why she could be acting so weird?
dad?
looks good.
Oh, yeah.
nothing like a week's worth of salt in a bowl to really hit the spot.
you want me to make you something?
you?
Hey, back in the day, I made a mean spaghetti.
what days were those?
you're still upset about Derek?
Yeah, but for a different reason.
did you know that Mariel's taking him with her to her meeting tonight?
what?
Yeah. She just called and said she bumped into him at the hospital, so she's not going to be home till after.
what's up with that?
I mean, the guy has been weird since the bonfire, but what's he doing with Mariel?
I just find that so weird. Don't you?
do you need to check in with anybody?
your mom or your dad? - No. No, they're out of town.
so you're all alone, then? - I guess.
well... not anymore.
Derek, you know that I'm a happily married woman, right?
and that I'm twice--or... nearly twice your age.
of course.
I'm gonna take you home - No, no, no, no, no.
look, there's something I want to show you.
what?
can we swing by Biscayne park? It's right on the way.
no, it's not. - It's almost on the way.
okay? Please.
well, what's in Biscayne park?
the water.
dad?
I'm at the church. Mariel's not here.
I need you to tell me about Derek.
what do you want to know?
what happened the night of the bonfire?
dad...
I need to know what happened to Derek!
we spent the night on the beach.
and then - what beach? Where?
Biscayne park.
dad?
dad?
you ever been here before?
not for a long time.
it's amazing, isn't it?
you feel it, too?
the pull?
Yeah.
it's hypnotic.
I want to take you in.
just for a couple of minutes. Okay? It's okay.
no. - Mariel, it's okay.
no, Derek, we have to go to our meeting. We're already late.
it's okay. Who cares? - Stop it.
you want this, too. I know you do. - Derek, let me go!
what are you doing? - It's okay. Come on.
what are you doing? - Why are you fighting me?
are you okay?
Yeah.
are you sure? - Yes.
go to your meeting.
go, Mariel.
we'll be fine. Go.
look, I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.
you like the water, Derek? - No.
you enjoy swimming? - No, please.
let's go swimming!
what... that was amazing.
you have a lot to learn.
Yeah. Yeah.
I guess I do.
my wife is not the answer.
no. - No.
I won't mess with her.
and I won't go to those meetings anymore.
no, no, no, no, no.
I want you to go to the meeting.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
and I think with the right guidance, you could play a valuable role in this community.
you do? - Yeah.
okay. Okay.
now listen to me.
there's a little work camp down in the glades.
I'm gonna send you there for a while, all right?
it's gonna sharpen you up a little bit.
and then maybe in six to eight months...
months?
you want something more permanent? - No. No, no.
cause I think that's the best solution for everybody.'
there you go.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
nothing. I was just-- - you're trespassin'.
sir... I'm with the park service.
I tagged a fish last night, and I just wanted to see if it was in your net.
did you do something to my son? - What?
Stevie! Stevie, get out here!
sir, could you put the gun down?
you recognize this fella?
what's wrong with him?
he's been like this since he got home this morning.
Stevie, come here.
this man thinks you stole his fish.
sir, I didn't say that he stole it.
how long was he on the water?
why is that thing making such a racket?!
I'm talking to you, mister!
drop it!
drop it, guy!
you drop it!
Russell, come on!
I think you'd better get going.
honey? Honey, you up?
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, I've been up for two hours now.
I just dropped Rose off at Mariel's.
Why? What's going on?
I got a live shot down at nine mile pond.
big story--the boats are running again.
how are you guys in all this rain?
it's not raining here.
is everything okay?
I don't--I'm not sure.
I'll tell you about it when I get back.
I love you. - I love you, too.
how'd that thing get away from us, Russ?
damn it, how'd it get away?
invasion -=The End=
Hey.
what's WRONG? THERE'S, UM...
there's SOMEONE OUTSIDE.
Hey, COME ON, GUYS.
whatever IT WAS, THEY'RE GONE NOW.
sheriff, CAN WE ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS?
do YOU HAVE A MINUTE FOR US? HOW ARE YOU FEELING, SHERIFF?
I FEEL GREAT. I'M HAPPY TO BE GETTING HOME
to MY FAMILY SO SOON. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL
for THE EXCELLENT DOCTORS HERE AT THE HOSPITAL.
any SUSPECTS IN YOUR SHOOTING?
I'm NOT GONNA GET INTO THE INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW.
you KNOW, I'M GONNA TAKE MY WIFE'S ADVICE
go HOME AND GET SOME REST. AS FOR THE INVESTIGATION,
the DETECTIVE HERE WILL ANSWER ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.
thank YOU, EVERYBODY. THANK YOU.
detective, WHAT INFORMATION CAN YOU GIVE US RIGHT NOW
about THIS CASE?
I'm GONNA MISS HAVING YOU AROUND.
I'll SEE YOU TONIGHT.
all SET, SHERIFF?
let's GO GET THIS SON OF A BITCH.
I'm SURE IT WAS A PERSON. THEY WERE WATCHING ME.
a MAN OR A WOMAN?
I- I DON'T KNOW.
they WERE CROUCHED DOWN IN THE DOORWAY,
and THEN...
and THEN THEY JUST TOOK OFF. I...
I'm HAVING A BABY, RUSSELL.
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN STAY HERE ANY LONGER.
honey, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ON EDGE
with ALL THAT'S HAPPENED, AND I UNDERSTAND,
but I'M STILL NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.
Hey, I WILL PROTECT YOU, I PROMISE.
I WANT OUR BABY TO BE SAFE, RUSSELL.
this DOESN'T FEEL SAFE.
I'll FIND IT
him, HER, WHATEVER IT WAS- AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
three DAYS AGO, I WAS SHOT,
and NOW, WELL, I'M ALMOST COMPLETELY HEALED.
some OF YOU SEEM SURPRISED.
well, ME, TOO.
I DID NOT KNOW THAT MY BODY COULD DO THIS.
like YOU, I'M STILL LEARNING ABOUT WHO AND WHAT I AM,
but ONE THING I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT NONE OF US
will EXPERIENCE THIS TRANSFORMATION IN THE SAME WAY.
some OF US WILL FIGHT IT.
others MAY EVEN BECOME VIOLENT.
I'm LOOKING FOR A MAN WHO NEEDS OUR HELP TODAY.
his NAME IS LEWIS SIRK. HE'S MY DEPUTY.
if ANY OF YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS,
I'd LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU.
small TOWN, SOMEBODY MUST KNOW SOMETHING.
no?
all RIGHT...
but IF ANY OF YOU ARE HARBORING HIM...
if ANY OF YOU ARE WITHHOLDING INFORMATION,
you WILL ALL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
no, DON'T CLEAN IT UP YET.
I WANT TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT THE CRIME SCENE
and IF YOU DON'T FINISH BY THE END OF THE DAY,
don't WORRY ABOUT IT. MARIEL AND MY DAUGHTER
they'll JUST STAY AT THE HOTEL AGAIN.
Roger that, sheriff. - GOT IT.
sheriff. HEY.
Hey, IS THE DEPUTY YOU'RE LOOKIN' FOR
the FELLA WITH ONE ARM?
could YOGIVE US A MINUTE?
Yeah. WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
well, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF SWIMMING LATELY.
I WAS OUT AT LOGAN BAY,
and I SAW THIS GUY SWIMMING WITH ONE ARM.
it WAS QUITE AN ODD SIGHT TO SEE, I HAVE TO TELL YOU.
now I DIDN'T GET THAT CLOSE, BUT WHEN I WAS LEAVING,
I SAW HIM WASHING SOME CLOTHES ON THE SHORE,
like ME MIGHT HAVE BEEN LIVING OUT THERE OR SOMETHING.
thank YOU, THANK YOU. THIS IS HELPFUL.
Yeah, I'M SORRY THAT I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING EARLIER, SHERIFF.
I JUST-WELL, I JUST DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I WAS A SNITCH.
you GOT IT. WE'LL KEEP THIS BETWEEN US, ALL RIGHT? ABSOLUTELY.
what ABOUT THE MILITARY?
they COULD HAVE SENT SOMEONE OUT HERE, RIGHT?
Larkin WAS SNOOPIN' AROUND THAT AIR BASE.
they WERE ON HER TAIL. THEY COULD BE AFTER HER AGAIN.
in THE SHOWER? OKAY, WHAT ABOUT HEALY?
he COULDA CAME OUT HERE TO TALK TO ONE OF US.
he's GOT MY PHONE NUMBER.
then WHAT IF IT'S THAT GUY HE TOLD YOU ABOUT-SZURA
the C. I.A. HYBRID ASSASSIN?
who SAID HE WAS AN ASSASSIN?
Hey, HEALY SAID THEY WERE IN CUBA TOGETHER.
what DO YOU THINK THEY WERE DOING OUT THERE, BUYING CIGARS?
they WERE THERE TO CHECK OUT THE LIGHTS IN THE WATER,
and SZURA GOT TAKEN.
and HEALY THINKS HE SHOT UNDERLAY, RIGHT?
so SZURA CAN BECOME THE TOP DOG, THE ALIEN KING? IT'S A THEORY. HE'S NOT SURE.
well, IF THIS GUY THINKS UNDERLAY'S A THREAT,
he's REALLY NOT GONNA LIKE LARKIN.
she ALMOST WENT ON THE NEWS AND BLEW THE WHISTLE
on THE ENTIRE ALIEN INVASION. ALL RIGHT, DAVE, WE STILL DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALIENS,
and THE ONLY REASON THAT ANYONE
would THINK THAT LARKIN IS A THREAT
is BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN BLABBING ABOUT OUR ENTIRE FAMILY
on THAT STUPID BLOG OF YOURS. IT'S NOT STUPID.
no. NO MORE.
she's SO FRIGHTENED NOW, OF EVERYTHING.
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR HER TO TRUST ME AGAIN.
she TRUSTS YOU, RUSS.
she JUST DOESN'T TRUST WHAT'S OUT THERE.
what's THAT?
what's WHAT?
is THAT...
whoa. THIS IS MINE.
what's IT DOING OUT HERE?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
look AT THIS.
what?
what IS THAT, A FOOTPRINT?
s HARD TO TELL.
Dave, GIVE ME THAT. WHAT?
your RECORD.
whoa, HEY, THAT'S MY FAVORITE BUDDY HOLLY RECORD, RUSS.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT? NO, NO, NO, NO.
Oh, RIGHT ON BUDDY'S FACE. COME ON. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, DAVE.
I'll CALL YOU IF I NEED YOU.
Yes, SIR.
sir.
Hello, LEWIS.
could YOU PUT THE GUN DOWN, PLEASE?
Y- YEAH, OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.
here.
just PUT IT DOWN.
Hi, DAD.
you BROUGHT HIM TO OUR HOUSE.
you TOLD ME TO TAKE CARE OF HIM, SO THAT'S WHAT I DID.
well, I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HIM LIKE THIS.
nothing HAPPENED, DAD. LEWIS AND I ARE FRIENDS, THAT'S ALL.
he JUST HASN'T WANTED TO SEE ANYONE.
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN REALLY UPSET BECAUSE OF YOU.
you LIED TO ME.
I- I- NO, YOU LIED TO ME. YOU TOLD ME HE GOT SHOT,
but THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT'S NOT HOW HIS ARM GOT MESSED UP.
what WERE YOU THINKING, DAD?
he LOST HIS ARM IN IRAQ,
and HE- AND HE GOES IN THE WATER
and SOMETHING INCREDIBLE HAPPENED TO HIM
his ARM CAME BACK. KIRA
I MEAN, HIS ARM CAME BACK,
and YOU JUST GOT SO FREAKED OUT BY IT,
that YOU TOLD HIM TO CUT IT OFF.
what HAPPENED TO LEWIS IS VERY COMPLICATED,
and-and IF PEOPLE FIND OUT ABOUT IT,
they WILL TEAR HIM APART. WHY?
because THEY'LL THINK HE'S A MONSTER,
and-and...
they WILL DESTROY HIM.
dad, IT WAS A MIRACLE. IT HAD TO BE.
and YOU JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH TO SUPPORT IT.
is THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU? IS THAT WHY HE SHOT ME?
he DIDN'T SHOOT YOU.
how DO YOU KNOW?
because I WAS TALKING TO HIM WHEN IT HAPPENED.
he GAVE ME THE NUMBER FOR A PAY PHONE OUT HERE,
and WE WERE TALKING
when MARIEL CALLED AND SAID YOU'D BEEN SHOT.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT DESPITE APPEARANCES,
Kira AND I HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMATE IN ANY WAY.
we've JUST TALKED.
Lewis, YOU LEFT A NOTE IN MY MAILBOX
accusing ME OFETRAYING YOU.
and I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, SIR, BUT...
do YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, SIR?
Yeah.
you DO? 'CAUSE KIRA WASN'T SURE. SHE THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T.
well, KIRA'S 17, LEWIS,
and SHE'S UNSURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. I BELIEVE IN GOD.
I BELIEVE THAT HE SAVED MY LIFE MORE THAN ONCE,
and I BELIEVE TH HE SAVED YOURS
when YOU MADE THE DECISION TO REMOVE YOUR ARM.
that's VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN MY LEADER, SIR.
I COULDN'T FOLLOW YOU UNLESS YOU WERE A MAN OF FAITH.
I'm SORRY I DOUBTED YOU.
it's ALL RIGHT.
there's MORE STUFF MISSING FROM UP HERE, RUSS,
my RECORD PLAYER IS GONE, TOO.
why DID YOU BRING THIS BACK?
we FOUND IT BY HIS RECORD.
but WHAT IS IT?
Oh, MY GOD. WHAT?
my BEER. BASTARD STOLE MY BEER.
I HAD AT LEAST TWO SIX-PACKS DOWN THERE.
Russell, IT-IT WAS A PERSON THAT WAS OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM,
not A HORSE OR A DEER OR WHATEVER THIS IS.
Larkin, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS YET.
I'm GOING BACK OUT THERE. DAVE, WAIT A SECOND.
no, I BET YOU IT'S THOSE KIDS
that HANG OUT AT THE STEEL BRIDGE.
saw THEM CRUISING THEIR A. T.V. s AROUND IT YESTERDAY. PUNKS.
Hey, DAD? WHAT?
Tom IS OUT BACK AND HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
Yeah, DADDY AND DAVE BUILT IT FOR ME.
Hey. ROSIE WAS JUST SHOWING ME HER TREE HOUSE.
surprised TO SEE YOU UP AND AROUND.
a LOT OF PEOPLE ARE. COME HERE, BABY.
Russell, YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS?
no.
in PRIVATE.
come ON, RUSS, LET'S TAKE A RIDE.
you EVER BEEN IN THE BACKSEAT OF ONE OF THESE THINGS?
Oh, OF COURSE YOU HAVE.
that MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SCARY.
arrested, YOUNG KID, LOOKIN' AT MURDER ONE.
I DIDN'T SHOOT YOU, TOM.
did I SAY YOU WERE A SUSPECT?
fingerprints ALL OVER MY HOUSE ASIDE,
your SON OWNING A. 45 ASIDE, DID I ACCUSE YOU IN ANY WAY?
my SON OWNS A. 45 BECAUSE YOU GAVE IT TO HIM.
what DO YOU WANT?
I KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT I AM, AT LEAST, YOU THINK YOU DO,
but SOMEONE MUST HAVE HELPED YOU WITH THIS INFORMATION.
you TOLDY WIFE STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING REPLICATED,
mass SUICIDES, CHILDREN BEING KILLED,
stories THAT YOU CLAIM SOMEONE ELSE TOLD YOU.
who IS THIS PERSON, RUSSELL?
because THEY SURE DON'T SOUND LIKE THEY LIKE ME.
this PERSON DIDN'T SHOOT YOU, EITHER.
how DO YOU KNOW? I KNOW.
well, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO DID?
no PROOF.
I'm OPEN TO CONJECTURE.
there's A GUY NAMED SZURA.
he MIGHT BE YOUR GUY.
szura? MM-HMM.
and WHERE DID YOU HEAR THIS NAME? SAME PERSON.
well, THIS PERSON CARRIES A LOT OF WEIGHT WITH YOU, DOESN'T HE?
well, I TRUST HIM.
but YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME WHO HE IS?
no.
because?
he DOESN'T TRUST YOU,
although HE DOES FEEL THAT YOUR SURVIVAL'S IMPORTANT,
and HE'S CERTAIN THAT SZURA'S A THREAT...
which IS INTERESTING BECAUSE... WELL, HE'S ONE OF YOU.
one OF ME?
Oh, ONE OF THE "HYBRIDS"?
I HEARD THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE CALLING US.
that's VERY TRENDY.
how DO YOU SPELL SZURA?
Oh, MAN.
what IS IT?
she SAW SOMETHING OUFRONT. BY THE FRONT DOOR.
Hey, HEY. HEY, WHAT'D YOU SEE, PAL?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT WAS BIG.
want ME TO LOOK FOR THIS? NO, NO, NO, NO! HEY, HEY, JESSE, NO.
I'll GO- I'LL GO LOOK FOR IT.
I WANT YOU GUYS TO GO WAIT IN ROSE'S ROOM, OKAY?
all RIGHT? CATCH YOUR BREATH, THERE, KIDDO, OKAY?
you're ALL RIGHT. QUICKLY, COME ON.
what DO YOU THINK IT IS, LARKIN?
all RIGHT, KEEP THE DOOR LOCKED, OKAY?
okay, ROSIE. WHY DON'T YOU SIT RIGHT HERE, OKAY?
but WHAT IS UNCLE DAVE GONNA DO IF FINDS IT?
okay.
what...
Oh, GOD, OH, GOD.
it's IN THE HOUSE.
Where's DADDY?
Shh.
when's HE COMING HOME?
he's WITH TOM, SWEETIE.
but I'M SURE HE'LL COME HOME AS SOON AS HE CAN.
I WANT TO HELP HIM. I WANT TO HELP DAVE.
we're STAYING HERE.
Shh.
Whoa! DAVE?
I'm HELPING HIM. DAD WOULD WANT ME TO. I DON'T CARE.
this IS YOURROTHER, LARKIN.
are YOU NOT THE LEAST BIT WORRIED ABOUT HIM?
Yes, BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, TOO.
now THAT ALL OUR CARDS ARE ON THE TABLE...
I'm HOPING WE CAN HAVE
a SMOOTHER, MORE PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP.
just BECAUSE SOMEONE'S DIFFERENT
doesn't MAKE THEM A MONSTER.
funny. I JUST SAID THE SAME THING TO MY WIFE THIS MORNING.
okay.
okay.
whoever YOU ARE, JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.
I've GOT A GUN!
I'll SHOOT YOU, I SWEAR!
shoot IT.
Hey, KIRA.
Hey.
what's UP?
can I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
what HAPPENS IN THE WATER?
something HAPPENED TO YOU
the NIGHT OF THE HURRICANE, RIGHT,
and TO MY DAD AFTER THE PLANE CRASH?
you BOTH CAME OUT DIFFERENT, DIDN'T YOU?
what HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'm TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
I KNOW SOMEONE ELSE IT HAPPENED TO.
Really?
why HASN'T IT HAPPENED TO ME?
Russell, I'M TELLING YOU, IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE ME.
I WOULDN'T GET TOO CLOSE.
no, I'M NOT.
Oh, HE'S STILL CONSCIOUS, RUSS.
Yeah, I CAN SEE THAT.
Oh, MAN, RUSS...
he DOES LOOK LIKE ME.
I MEAN, A VERY MESSED UP VERSION OF ME, BUT...
if YOU LOOK INTO HIS EYES...
then IT MIGHT NOT BE AN ACCIDENT
that THIS THIN WAS TAKING MY STUFF. DAVE?
Hey. LARKIN.
what IS IT?
did YOU CATCH IT?
Oh, MY GOD, WHAT IS THAT?
we're NOT EXACTLY SURE.
is IT A HYBRID?
Russell, THIS MAY HAVE HAPPENED THE NIGHT THAT CREATURE
got AHOLD OF MY LEGS.
what ARE YOU SAYING?
the NIGHT...
after THE HURRICANE, DAVE GOT ATTACKED...
in THE WATER.
we TOLD EVERYONE IT WAS A GATOR, BUT...
it WASN'T A GATOR.
so... YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU THINK THAT THIS... THING...
came FROM YOU?
I WAS ONLY UNDER FOR A MINUTE.
Russell PULLED ME OUT RELY FAST.
it MAY NOT HAVE GOTTEN ENOUGH GENETIC INFORMATION.
Aw, HELL, RUSS.
what ARE WE GOING TO DO?
it LOOKS REALLY SICK.
it's ALL BLEEDING, ITS SKIN'S ALL BLISTERED.
it THINK IT'S HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.
I THINK WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
all RIGHT, LOOK, I GOT A FIRST AID KIT IN MY TRUCK.
are YOU GOING TO TOUCH IT? IT MAY BE DYING.
but, RUSSELL, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THING IS.
you DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO.
Larkin... LARKIN, COME HERE.
no.
no, NO, NO, COME HERE. IT'S-IT'S TRYING TO SEE YOU.
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS YOU TO LEAVE.
it's OKAY, COME HERE.
if YOU JUST COME DOWN HERE...
Oh, GOD! OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
what IS IT DOING? I DON'T KNOW.
all RIGHT, BACK UP, BACK UP. OKAY...
all RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIT, BACK, BACK, BACK.
it's OKAY, YOU OKAY? LARKIN, HEY.
what IS THAT?
what IS IT?
it's US.
it's-it's US WHEN WE WERE KIDS.
it's US.
there ARE A LOT OF MR. VARON'S FINGERPRINTS HERE, SIR.
do YOU KNOW IF HE OWNS A. 45? HE DIDN'T SHOOT ME, LEWIS.
the ONLY REASON I WANTED TO TALK TO HIM
was TO SEE WHAT HE KNEW,
and HE KNOWS A LOT.
it MAY LEAD TO SOMETHING... BUT HE DIDN'T DO THIS.
are YOU...
are YOU FEELIN' ALL RIGHT, SIR?
better THAN ALL RIGHT.
I HOPE Y NEVER GET SHOT, LEWIS, BUT IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN,
be GLAD YOU'RE IN THE BODY YOU GOT RIGHT NOW.
it's A HELL OF AN UPGRADE. THANKS.
Kira, HEY, BABY.
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA MEET YOU AT THE HOTEL.
I NEED SOME MORE CLOTHES.
I TALKED TO MARIEL.
Oh?
I HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR HER.
she SAID I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.
well, IT'S NOT REALLY A GREAT TIME RIGHT NOW, HONEY.
we're STILL WORKING.
well, WHEN IS A GOOD TIME?
I DON'T KNOW.
well, CAN I TALK TO LEWIS, THEN?
about WHAT?
dad, CAN I JUST TALK TO HIM, PLEASE, FOR TWO MINUTES?
will YOU COME WITH ME TO GET MY STUFF?
I...
Yeah.
take A BREAK. GO AAD.
five.
how's HE DOING?
his BREATHING HAS SLOWED DOWN A LOT.
Hey, LARK, COME HERE.
this WAS, UH,
this WAS MY FAVORITE PICTURE OF US WHEN WE WERE KIDS.
did YOU KNOW THAT?
he COULD HAVE TAKEN A LOT OF PICTURES,
but HE TOOK THIS ONE.
how MUCH DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS?
I MEAN...
do YOU THINK HE REMEMBERS WHEN THIS WAS TAKEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
does HE HAVE YOUR MEMORIES?
well, MARIEL HAS HERS.
Yeah, BUT MARIEL CAME BACK WHOLE.
everyone WE KNOW OF, SO FAR, ANYWAY, HAS COME BACK WHOLE.
he's WHOLE. HE'S JUST DIFFERENT.
I'm SORRY IF I GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE WITH MY DAD.
no, NO, NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
it WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME
to BE SHARING THE THINGS WITH YOU THAT I DID.
but, YOU KNOW,
I've JUST NEVER BEEN THAT CLOSE WITH PEOPLE,
especially AFTER I LOST THE ARM.
people WERE ALWAYS LIKE, "OH, POOR GUY.
I HATE THAT.
I KNOW.
people HAVE ALWAYS TREATED ME LIKE, "POOR ORPHAN GIRL, LOST HER MOM.
it SUCKS.
look, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
even IF WE DON'T GET TO SEE EACH OTHER MUCH ANYMORE,
I BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU SAID.
I BELIEVE THAT YOU GETTING YOUR ARM BACK WAS A MIRACLE.
I'm SORRY MY FATHER DIDN'T.
thank YOU.
it's HIS PROBL.
I TRIED TALKING TO MARIEL ABOUT IT,
but I THINK I JUST MADE HER UNCOMFORTABLE.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE WATER.
good OR BAD, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT, 'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS FELT DIFFERENT, TOO.
I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED ME...
and I'VE EVEN BEEN POPULAR,
but I'VE NEVER REALLY FELT LIKE I BELONGED ANYWHERE...
not EVEN IN MY OWN FAMILY.
and IT'S JUST GETTING WORSE.
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THIS SECRET CLUB, YOU KNOW?
and THEY JUST DON'T WANT ME TO BE A PART OF IT.
Yeah.
you KNOW, KIRA, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO FATHER SCANLON
about ALL THIS.
he RUNS THE HURRICANE SURVIVOR GROUP,
and THEY'VE ALL HAD SIMILAR EXPER - LEWIS.
I PROMISED MARIEL THAT WE'D FINISH TONIGHT.
it's ALL RIGHT. WAS JUST LEAVING.
good NIGHT, WIS.
night, KIRA.
SEYA.
so YOU TWO WORK EVERYTHING OUT?
she's A VERY SPECIAL GIRL, SIR.
Yes, SHE IS. SHE'S ALSO A VERY YOUNG GIRL.
and IN MANY WAYS, SHE'S A VERY NAIVE GIRL.
I SUGGESTED SHE SPEAK WITH FATHER SCANLON.
whenever I'VE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS,
he's ALWAYS BEEN VERY HELPFUL.
but YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM RECENTLY, HAVE YOU?
Oh, YES, SIR. HE'S THE FIRST PERSON I SOUGHT COUNSEL FROM
after I LEFT YOUR HOUSE.
Really?
he-he's MPRIEST.
no, I KNOW. YOU SAW HIM RECENTLY?
did YOU TALK ABOUT CUTTING OFF YOUR...
Yes, SIR,
but IT WAS IN COESSION, SO...
sir?
should WE TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL?
I THINK IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.
I SHOULD GO INSIDE.
I PROMISED ROSE I WOULDN'T BE GONE FOR VERY LONG.
Hey, LISTEN, UH, DON'T- DON'T TELL THE KIDS ABOUT THIS.
Yeah, I WON'T.
I HOPE OUR BABY'S LIKE YOU.
I HOPE THAT HE OR SHE
is NEVER AFRAID OF WHAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
Oh, MY GOD, I AM HEARTILY SORRY FOR MY SINS,
and I FIRMLY RESOLVE, WITH THE HELP OF THY GRACE,
to CONFESS MY SINS...
to DO PENANCE...
and TO AMEND MY LIFE.
I
it's ALL RIGHT, FATHER.
you're NOT ALONE.
we BOTH KNOW IT WAS YOU.
what DO YOU MEAN?
Oh, COME ON, WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA MAKE ME
start QUOTING PASSAGES OF JUDAS?
why WOULD YOU WANT TO KILL ME?
you ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE OF GOD'S GRACE.
you-you MUTILATED A MAN IN THE NAME OF YOUR OWN...
twisted BELIEF.
you MISLED US ALL, TOM.
after LEWIS CAME TO ME, I WAS...
overcome WITH RAGE AT YOUR BETRAYAL.
to THINK THAT I HAD COUNSELED YOU IN GOD'S NAME...
how COULD YOU THINK YOU'D EVER ESCAPE HIS JUSTICE?
how COULD YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU'D ESCAPE MINE
are YOUR DEPUTIES OUTSIDE?
you're NOT GOING WITH MY DEPUTIES.
as A MATTER OF FACT,
you're NOT EVEN GONNA GO TO JAIL.
I'm GONNA SEND YOU TO ANOTHER PLACE ENTIRELY.
what SORT OF PLACE?
it's A PLACE THAT AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE RUNS...
a MR. SZURA.
have YOU EVER HEARD OF HIM?
no.
well, HE'S A HELL OF A GUY,
and HE RUNS A LITTLE CAMP DOWN IN THE KEYS
for PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU WHO'VE LOST THEIR WAY.
I THINK THIS PLACE IS GONNA STRAIGHTEN YOU RIGHT OUT.
it SEEMS TO BE WORKING FOR OTHERS.
I THINK IT'S A NAME YOU'RE GONNA REMEMBER.
hurricane 2-1 to Hurricane control...
we are 5 miles from the eye wall.
copy that, Hurricane 2-1.
4 miles to the hurricane eye wall! - All right!
let's cut her open !
hold on to your hats, folks ! we're going inside !
we're in the eye. Drop the sonde and get us a reading.
sonde away.
sea level pressure's at 936 millibars.
how fast is she moving now ? - 30 degrees at 14 knots.
at this rate, she'll make Miami by sundown.
hurricane 2-1 to Hurricane control.
what is going on down there ?
she's changed course.
no, no, no, I'm seeing something else... something bigger under the water.
my screen's going nuts. I got lights... thousands of lights.
military ? - No !
Hey, Mona, we're still not boarded up ? - They should be here any minute!
who are they ? - Their car broke down.
I told 'em I'd take 'em to the shelter, but they don't wanna go.
Hey, Ma'am ?
there's a big hurricane coming. You really don't want to be here right now.
we're supposed to meet his father in Ocala. He's worried about him.
Hey, your Dad's gonna be fine. I'm sure he'd want you to be safe, though.
know what ? maybe you can do me a favor.
my little buddy here needs a ride to the shelter.
Hey, think you can get him there for me ? yeah ?
okay.
there you go.
all right, you guys should go with my partner.
Ocala's not gonna get much of this. Your husband's gonna be fine.
gracias. - De nada.
all right, Mona, they're with you ! see you on the other side !
all right! Hop in, you guys !
after Andrew and they dodged Charlie.
so folks out here are pretty confident that they can withstand anything.
that being said, they're not taking any chances.
the owner of this gas station told me that he's had lines around the block.
like this since yesterday.
but when I talked to the drivers of these vehicles.
they tell me that they're heading straight back home to wait it out.
folks out here are pretty confident they can withstand anything.
but by tomorrow, they just might think again.
this is Larkin Groves reporting live from Florida City.
and we're out.
great. Thanks.
get some more b-roll. I'll be in the van... throwing up.
yeah ? - Hey, honey.
Hey.
why aren't you home ? - Cause the I-Team never sleeps.
well, pregnant women shouldn't be covering hurricanes.
well, one more stop at Dixon's for a little Q&A with the stockpilers.
and then all my nausea will be yours.
where are you ?
just locking down the station before this thing makes landfall.
you talk to your brother ?
Yeah, he's with your kids at the house. He and Jesse got most of the plywood up, and Rose put new batteries in everything, and I guess Mariel's called a lot.
why ?
she's their mother. She's probably concerned.
I'm their father. They'll be fine.
will you come home ? - I will. - I love you. - I love you, too.
we are having record pressure readings.
the eye has expanded then contracted.
from 20 miles to 10 miles, then back to 20 miles...
she won't be out here, Rose. Rain's coming, and cats hate rain.
I saw her run out the kitchen door.
well... maybe you should check in the shed again.
hey ! Where'd you guys put the beer ? - What ?
I saw you stackin' them cans in the pantry earlier.
Where'd you put the beer ?
I didn't see any beer. - What ?
dad didn't get any more beer, Dave. Just what was in the fridge.
have you seen Carlita ?
who's Carlita ?
my cat. - No.
look, I'm going to the market. I'll be back in a second, okay ?
rose, could you get that for me ?
you can't leave us, Dave. Dad's gonna be pissed.
why don't you call Larkin or someone ? maybe she can get you some beer.
no, she won't ! she doesn't like it when I drink.
gee, I wonder why.
hey... Hey, don't talk to me like that. I'm your uncle.
no, you're my stepmother's brother.
right, whatever. Trust me, when this thing hits, you're gonna want beer.
I've been through hurricanes before. - No, not like this one, you haven't.
I've been monitoring this bad boy. You wanna know what my people are saying?
not really.
they think the whole thing is a smoke screen, Jesse.
Dave, I really gotta get this stuff...
a smoke screen cooked up by the military.
Dave ! mom wants to talk to you !
you'll see.
he's still not home. How was I ever married to this person ?
well, weren't you like, 11, at the time ?
will you take this to room 405, please ? - Right away.
college sweethearts... the root of all evil.
unbelievable. There's a huge storm coming,
and the father of my children's out picking acorns somewhere.
make sure everyone's out of maternity.
Yeah, hey. - Dave, sorry to bother you again
Oh, no, it's no bother.
rose tells me you're leaving to get beer.
uh... no.
no, she's mistaken. I'm staying right here with my happy apple.
okay, that's good to hear.
I really don't think they should be left alone right now.
frankly, I wish they were here with me. - Yeah.
could you have Russell call me when he gets there ?
Hey, yeah, Dr Dave is on it.
great. Thanks, Dave. - You're welcome.
the guy's an idiot.
I got so much to do. I just... - Ms Mccall, for your own safety.
we're gonna have to move you to a room without a window. - So when do you get the kids again ? - Monday after school.
well, I'm sure they'll be fine. That Larkin girl seems pretty responsible...at least on tv.
you guys all clear here on the south side?
all right, my guys, you stay with me. Stay on the same channel.
they say 6: 00, but don't you believe it. Who knows what's gonna happen?
everybody clear on this ?
Hey, doc, When you coming home ?
ten minutes ?
all right, I'm gonna hold you to that. Take Krome Avenue.
the Turnpike's already closed, all right ?
that's a really nice haircut.
well, he's all charm today. What are you feedin' him ?
me.
all right, guys, let's do it. Do it up, man.
he's picking you up!
come on, Kira.
dad, I have asked you a thousand times not to pick me up in this car.
I couldn't help it today, honey.
Eve's got me working overtime.
so... uh, how was school today ?
we had an assembly, and...
this dorky safety guy told us if it gets really crazy tonight.
we're supposed to get in a bathtub and sleep under a mattress.
Yeah, right. In case the roof caves in ? I mean, that'll be comfortable.
the roof's not gonna cave in.
how do you know ?
I know.
Hey, Dad ! - Hey, bud.
I got everything almost finished. - Great ! here, help me with this stuff.
Where's everybody ?
rose and Dave are in the house, but Larkin's not even back yet.
she call ? - No !
Hey, hey ! I found a secret stash !
you talk to your sister ? - No.
Russell, you're home.
Yeah, I live here.
what are you doing here, Mariel ?
I just wanted to make sure that the kids were okay. I just talked to Dave...
Hey, honey.
Hey.
everything okay ? - Yeah, everything's good.
Oh, your hair is wet. Did you take your cough medicine?
Yeah.
Where's Rose? - She's in the house.
can I say hi ?
you shouldn't be here now.
I just want to see my daughter. Do you mind ?
I'll go get her.
what ?
are you ever gonna trust me ?
what are you talking about ?
mariel, you always do this.
every time the kids are with me, you're always checking up.
no, I'm not.
how many times did you call today ?
Russell, there is a hurricane coming.
I have a right to know that my children are safe.
they're our children !
our children, Mariel !
I'm perfectly capable of taking care of them...
you know what ? this isn't about you.
this is about the fact that I want to see my kids.
hey ! - Stop taking everything so personally.
I just want to see my kids. Why can't you understand that ?
what don't you understand ?! I only see them once a weekend...
dad ! dad !
rose isn't here.
what do you mean ?
we checked every room, but we can't find Rose.
you lost our daughter ? - No, I didn't lose her. I just got home.
you know what ? she's probably next door at the Lassards'.
just go home, Mariel !
I'm not going anywhere.
go home !
I'm waiting for her !
we'll have her call you when she gets back !
I'm waiting !
she was just here five minutes ago !
she just went looking for her cat ! - Jesse !
Mariel ! go home ! - I'm not going anywhere, Russell !
why do you keep doing this, Mom ? - Doing what ?
pushing everyone away !
why don't you just go home and worry about your new husband and leave us alone ?
please ! - Jesse !
go !
you're not holding it straight !
I can't see what straight is ! just hammer!
that's good! That's good !
you okay ?
Yeah.
are you sure you're okay ? - Yeah, yeah.
Oh, man, did that thing come up quick or what?
Yeah.
the meteorologist said he thought it was gonna come further north, but...
Where's Russell ?
he went to find Rose.
Rosie ? out there !
Carlita was here the whole time ?
she probably snuck in when I got home.
I bet you were so scared.
we were all scared, Rose.
rose, look at me.
you know never to leave the house without telling somebody where you're going.
I didn't know where I was going.
daddy ?
did you see the lights ?
no. What lights ?
in the sky. I saw a bunch of colored lights.
it's probably another power line. I'm sure they're down everywhere.
I love you.
love you, too, Daddy.
Hey, Rose.
here you go. You got that one ?
are all the phones out ? - Yep. Not one tower held.
got no electricity or water, neither. Everything's gone.
governor's already declared most of dade county a disaster area.
Russell ! God. - Hey.
what happened ? where were you ?
it's okay, honey. We're all okay.
right ?
Yeah.
dad !
hey !
Oh, gosh, good to see you.
you all right ? - Yeah, I'm good.
good.
Hey, where'd you find that cat ?
she was in Dad's truck the whole time.
Oh, man. I'm glad you found her, Rose. - Hey, you're alive.
Hey, us, too. - Good.
well, what happened ? we lost a little roof there ?
Yeah, windows blew out, too. The place is completely soaked.
Hi, Rosie. I am so glad to see you.
could I feed Carlita ? - Yeah.
I think I know where there's a can of cat food.
think I know where there's a can of everything.
Hey, be careful in there.
Wow. - We're all okay. That's all that matters, huh ? - Yeah.
where were you ? I called and called.
Hey, what's he doing here ?
Jesse, can you give us a second ?
why ? what's wrong ?
Mariel didn't make it home last night. - What ?
Tom called on your radio this morning.
he said that the last time he spoke to her, she had just left here,
and he said she was very upset.
all right, look, I'm sure she's just stuck somewhere. You know, like we were.
Yeah.
it's okay.
I'd say good morning, but... - Good morning, Tom.
did you have words with your mother last night, son ?
this isn't his fault.
I didn't say it was.
did you tell your Mom to leave last night, Jesse ?
I told her to leave.
that might not have been the wisest idea, huh ?
sheriff Underlay ? come in, Underlay.
UNDERLAY, come in, please.
Yeah, come back.
come in.
Hey. Jesse, it's not your fault.
he's just upset. - Yeah.
it's just my mom, you know ?
she's always so worried that something bad's gonna happen that she ends up...
making it happen.
sucks.
did you check the plate ? check the plate.
it's a match. - 10-4.
they found the car.
don't worry, Rosie. We're gonna get this all cleaned up.
did they find mommy yet ?
not yet, but I'm sure they will.
Yeah, I'm sure they will, too.
Yeah. So Kira's gonna come with me.
okay ? and we're gonna be back around 3.
you got that, Dave ? - Yeah.
listen, I'm telling you,
you want a good story, you go down to the abandoned Air force base.
there's all kinds of secret projects going on there.
I really gotta go, Dave.
right.
Bye, Rosie.
Bye.
Bye, Rose.
Bye. - See you.
don't you worry, kiddo. I'm gonna have this roof fixed for you in no time.
you ever fix roofs before ?
Yeah, sure, after Andrew, I did it for a living.
what do you do now ?
I'm kind of between jobs right now.
what was your last job ?
well, I managed an apartment building with my girlfriend, but...
she kicked me out, so...
you're here.
Yeah.
did you see the lights ?
what lights ?
I saw a bunch of lights In the sky last night.
dad thought they were sparks,
but they were much bigger.
really ?
Where'd you see them ?
landing in the water.
landing?
what, uh...
what kind of shape were they ?
mom !
I don't understand why she would leave the car.
she probably felt safer in here.
these melaleuca trees are pretty tough.
why some people, you people.
want to spend millions trying to get rid of them, I don't understand.
they're killing the park.
they take 15 acres a day.
survival of the fittest.
dad !
dad !
dad !
come on, baby.
come on.
come on, baby.
come on.
okay.
okay.
okay, it's okay.
it's okay.
mom?
it's Jesse, honey.
Hey, mom.
call the hospital, tell them we're coming.
tell them we're coming.
tell them we're coming.
look she's gonna be alright.
I hope so.
I wonder what happened to her clothes.
it's hard to describe the emotion here, Peter.
I've talked to so many people who've lost everything.
yet the overwhelming feeling seems to be hopeful.
families who's home were less damaged.
were opening their doors to their neighbors.
helping them with their children, just helping them any way they can.
it's a nice reminder that even in the most difficult times,
the human spirit remains strong.
this is Larkin Groves reporting live from Florida city.
we're clear and we're out.
great. - Good job.
if your family isn't out here by tomorrow, call me.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I'd like to be on TV someday.
Oh yeah? Why?
I don't know maybe 'cause you can help people.
you know, like, when my mom died, I really couldn't believe it, you know.
until I saw the story on the news.
even though all these reporters were going on about how terrible it was,
you know, two seconds later, they were laughing and talking about the weather.
so in a way, it made me feel better.
I'm not sure that's such a good thing.
me either.
no, but my dad says television's important.
because it distracts people from the truth.
like with this hurricane,
I mean, you know, it's terrible, but on the news it'll just be a story.
and at first the reporters will be serious about it.
but after awhile they'll be laughing and making jokes.
and then everyone will be distracted from what's really going on.
what is really going on ?
the truth.
where are my kids ?
you know where they are. They're at Russell's.
I want to see them.
we're gonna have 'em back on Monday.
I want to see them now.
Hi, baby.
Thanks, Ruth. We'll take it from here.
thank you, Ruth.
how you feeling, sweetie ?
I was telling the mayor that we felt that a quarantine might be in order.
at least for the first few weeks.
do you really think it's necessary, Mariel ?
we're so cut off as it is.
we have no idea what's been let loose here, mayor.
the I. C. U. is badly damaged. We're got hundreds of people missing.
the water may be contaminated. Better safe than sorry.
I'll have to clear it with the council.
of course. You do. Whatever you have to do.
all right, all right.
let's go home.
we're done here.
what's happening to me ?
you sure you saw the lights out here ?
Yeah.
we're a long way from home.
so?
must have been a hell of a lot of lights.
there were.
what's that ?
what ?
right there, that shiny thing.
Oh, hey, hey, sit down.
want to get bit ?
bit by what ?
a gator, goofball.
a gator won't bite you ?
no, they're afraid of me.
what is it ?
I don't know.
could be a piece of a boat.
which part ?
I can't tell you, but...
whatever it is, it's stuck down there good.
why won't a gator bite you ?
uh, yeah. Let's get outta here, huh ?
thanks for letting me go back to my house, dad.
this is your house.
I mean my real house.
Hey, Bud. How you doing ? - Hey, Tom.
Hey. - What's going on ?
here she comes. Hello, honey.
slide that kitty right in the backseat here.
let your brother help you out there. All right.
it's very good of you to let them come with us, Russell.
her mom really appreciates it. Thanks.
how's she doing ? - She's good, fine.
by tomorrow, I think she'll be better than ever.
good.
here you go, honey.
all right,
I love you, Rosabelle.
I love you, too, Daddy.
okay.
here, put your seat belt on.
Jess, tell your mom I hope she feels better.
Yeah.
okay, have fun.
Thanks, dad.
we'll talk soon.
Hey, Tom, there's still a little something I'm confused about.
what's that ?
well, just, you said last time you spoke with Mariel.
she was just leaving here ?
that's right.
we lost cell service pretty early yesterday. How'd she get through to you ?
must have stopped and used a pay phone.
Thanks.
father Scanlon, just a few questions, please.
how many hours were you in the water, sir ?
excuse me, can we just get a word, sir?
the E. M. T. said that you were there for 16 hours.
is that true, sir ? - Did you ever lose your faith ?
I have to go.
father jeffrey scanlon.
obviously distraught after a terrible night in the everglades, lifted from the water by paramedics seemingly in amazing health, actually.
let's go back to you in the studio.
poor guy.
that's the second time I've seen that look today.
Yeah.
completely disoriented, no clothes.
how do you spend all night in a hurricane and not have a mark on you ?
you did.
Hi.
Russ, can I see you for a second ?
Yeah, you sure can.
you took Rose out on an airboat today ?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I knew there was something weird about this hurricane, Russ.
and I thought it was cover for the military, but I was wrong.
whoa ! jeez !
what is that ?
you tell me.
it's a skeleton.
Yeah.
and the other stuff ?
Where'd you find this ?
in the water about 2 miles south of everglades city.
what, did Rose see it ? - No, no, no, no, no,
I dropped her off, and I went back to get it.
well, take it to the police, Dave.
no way, Russ. They'll just cover it up.
you think they want people to know that we have an extraterrestrial in our midst ?
what ?
are you drunk ? - No, I'm not drunk, Russell.
look at this thing.
it's got spikes poking through its head and its neck.
like it just had the life sucked right out of it.
Dave, this is a person.
I know.
he may have had a family.
I mean, we need to find out who he is and what really happened to him.
I know, and we will, we will, but on our own.
I want to go back there tonight,
and I want you to come with me.
no, Dave. - Come on, Russ.
come on, come on, come on.
you've been studying weird plants and animals your whole life.
I show you the work of one E.B.E.
a what ?
an extraterrestrial biological entity.
Dave, will you stop ?
there are no aliens.
then will you tell me what's going on here ?
I don't know.
maybe a sea creature.
we weren't in the ocean.
all right, Dave. I'll admit this is interesting,
but I'm not gonna go out there with you tonight.
come on, Russ, come on !
look, I know that you don't care about aliens.
but I know that you care about your wife and kids.
so do I.
and...
I don't want them to end up like this guy.
Russ, I have to do something tonight, and I'm asking you please to come with me.
were you really worried about me ?
Yeah, I was.
dad said you were.
I was worried about you, too.
know what, sweetie ?
I think you gotta go to sleep now.
will you take me to school tomorrow ?
there's not gonna be any school for awhile, honey.
will a hurricane come again tonight ?
no.
mommy ?
you smell different.
what am I looking for ?
lights.
in the sky ?
no, in the water.
Rosie said that when they landed, they didn't go out.
they didn't go out ?
no. That's what made me so suspicious.
you ever been out this way before ?
Yeah, after the 96 plane crash.
a lot of park people were called in for search and rescue.
Oh, my god.
that might be what I found today.
no, Dave, you found an alien.
no, no, no, not that.
I found a piece of metal in the water today.
I bet it's from that plane.
well, maybe the martians shot it down.
what's that ? Hey, hey !
Hey, right there. Look.
look. Did you see that ?
there it is again. Right there. Straight ahead, Straight ahead.
slow down.
what do you say now ?
a fish.
a jellyfish, maybe.
Yeah, come on.
all right, if that's a fish, where's the light coming from?
bioluminescence.
bio what ?
it's a life light.
a lot of fish have it to identify other members of the species.
so they can mate or...
scare away predators...
or attract prey.
Dave, I wouldn't do that.
I don't think...
Oh, my god !
that was no fish !
that was no fish !
are you all right ? are you all right ?
I think my leg's broken. - What ?
my leg's...
be careful.
emergency supply centers are being set up all over the county.
and volunteers are desperately needed, so if you think you can help out.
please, call the number you'll be seeing on our screen.
or come down here to the homestead hospital.
and speak to one of these aid workers.
now we understand you have a family member in there, Larkin ?
Yes, that's right.
my brother Dave got into a bit of a wrestling match with an alligator last night.
did you tell 'em a gator did this ?
for now, it's the most plausible explanation.
it was an E.B.E.
extraterrestrial biological entity ?
that's a dumb name for an alien.
good morning, Gentlemen.
good morning.
heard you had a little accident last night.
mind if I take a peek ?
be my guest.
gently, please.
how you feeling, Mare ?
Oh, much better.
Thanks.
kids okay ?
Oh, yeah, they're great.
rose decided it would be a good idea to give her cat a bath this morning.
which didn't go over too well.
and Kira made Jesse breakfast.
which I thought was really sweet.
I understand you ordered full quarantine for the area.
Yeah, I think it's best.
with everything that's been stirred up,
we just don't know what's out there right now.
Oh, you got that right.
well...
you're a very lucky man.
how do you figure ?
judging from the size of these teeth marks,
that gator could have swallowed you whole.
what makes you so sure it was a gator ?
what else could it be ?
you're feeling better now, aren't you ?
Yeah.
the first days are the toughest,
but you're gonna be okay.
baby steps, honey.
baby steps.
it's a large storm.
lot of wind.
free lights.
I've got lights-- thousands of lights.
I saw a bunch of lights in the sky last night.
can you keep a secret, honey?
I saw them, too.
I don't remember what happened that night.
my dad took your mom to the water so she wouldn't feel alone.
he did this to her on purpose?
my mother didn't have to be this way.
I guess people are acting strange.
a lot of guys didn't hang out with each other last year.
I think he knows a lot more than he's letting on.
I'm gonna find out why the air force is down here, and if there's a cover-up, who's involved.
now you can help me get the story, or you can be the story.
it's your choice.
according to my contact, they were after a missing weather plane.
then what's going on over there dave thinks aliens have invaded our town.
these creatures take people's d. n.a.
to create a new being, like a hybrid.
I am not an alien! then what are you?
what's going on?
looks like you're having a litter.
there's something really not right with the guy.
I hope you never get shot, lewis, but if it should happen, be glad you're in the body you got right now.
it's a hell of an upgrade.
why would you wanna kill me?
you misled us all, tom.
I'm gonna send you to a mr. szura.
he runs a little camp down in the keys what are you doing?!
but they're not around anymore.
I'll do anything to protect my family.
I don't know who i am anymore.
I'm gonna find out what's going on.
there's really nothing to worry about everything's under control.
I'm telling you, russ, this is a bad idea.
we shouldn't be here.
trying to find szura on our own is crazy.
we should go back home, get some help.
szura could be gone by then. yeah...
but our radio's jammed, russ. our cell phones aren't working.
how we gonna call the cavalry if
look, he murdered two people last night, dave.
did you not see that? of course i did.
I also saw a lot of other people backing him up.
look, if you wanna go back and call for some help, go.
take the boat. i'll find him on my own.
no, man.
what is the matter with you, man?
you got a death wish all of a sudden?
I'm not going back until i've got some answers.
and if you find szura, what are you gonna do then, huh?
huh? you gonna kill him?
what are you gonna do then?
that's up to him.
Hey, what if he's got this whole island booby-trapped?
well, i guess we'll find out.
I'm telling you, we need to find a working radio...
so we can at least contact someone just in case we're
in case we're dead?
no.
what the hell was that?
it sounded like some kind of signal call.
Oh, great. "the humans are here.
Aw, man. it's them.
what the hell happened to her?
she was pregnant.
Oh, i know...
but what came out?
I'm not saying i won't do it, val.
I'm just saying there might be more interesting stories to cover.
people already know that their lights are on, val.
I don't know if that's necessarily news. all right.
Yeah, i'm about ten minutes from the plant right now. okay, bye.
are you okay?
you came out so fast, i didn't see you.
you need a doctor.
you can take a shower now, jess. i'm done.
Thanks, rose.
what are you doing?
I promised larkin i'd help you get ready for school.
so what do you want to wear?
I said i can handle it, rose.
I don't mind.
did dad come home last night?
Nah. larkin said he's still working, so mr. elmore is going to take us to school today.
so...
basically we have no parents now, is that right?
that's, uh...
that's the gun tom gave me.
have you shot it yet?
no.
why did daddy tom give it to you?
maybe he wants to see if i know how to use it.
she's waiting in your office, sir.
did she say what this was about?
no.
it's good to see you.
you, too.
I heard about your shooting. you look remarkable.
good genes.
but what can we do for you today?
well, this is kind of awkward.
I'd like to keep this between us.
always.
we had a psych patient go a. w.o. l. this morning.
he's a young helicopter pilot, just back from a long tour in iraq.
we're hoping you can help us find him before the media gets ahold of this.
do you have any idea where he's headed?
no, but we think someone may have picked him up.
an old green bronco?
where are we going?
to the hospital.
no.
your leg is in really bad shape.
well, it doesn't matter.
look, why don't you just let me off right here?
no, i won't.
well, i am not going to a hospital. you understand?
okay. okay.
thank you.
you're welcome. just right over to the table.
okay.
I'm just gonna go get the first aid kit, okay?
are you all right?
may i have a glass of water, please?
sure.
you think underlay knows about this
that szura's got his own little hybrid island here?
of course he knows.
I'm sure he sent him half the people we saw on the beach last night.
Yeah, but why?
what are they doing? what's the big plan?
that's what we're gonna find out.
what is that, barracks?
looks like an old military base.
well, where there's a satellite dish there may be a phone.
I guess i missed "robin hood and the cambrian explosion"on amazon.
it's the exact same layout across the hall.
it's like japanese modern meets the bay of pigs.
it's bizarre.
Hey, russ. look at this.
no phone.
no internet either.
this is a downlink station, russ
only receives data.
Russ, come here.
looks like they're pirating images off a satellite grid.
west africa...
Brazil...
Cuba. you name it.
look at the water.
they're monitoring temperature.
these are different gradations in the atlantic currents.
why do they care about water temperature?
maybe they care about what's in the water.
let me know if this is too hot, okay?
you're already healing.
you've gone through some changes lately, haven't you?
I was a lieutenant in the air force...
53rd weather recon.
you're a hurricane hunter?
my crew was, uh...
stationed out of biloxi.
we tracked storms, mostly in the gulf.
we were sent into the eye of hurricane eve.
you were on that plane that went down.
Yes, ma'am.
hold on to your hats, folks! we're going inside!
all right, let's cut her open!
drop the sonde and get us a reading.
c-level pressure's at 9-3-6 kilowatts.
what is going on down there?
she's changed course.
no, no, no. i'm seeing something else, something bigger
under the water.
my screen's going nuts.
I got lights-- thousands of lights! military?
No! he's--he's...
Oh, my god.
I have to go.
Why? what's wrong?
please, i want to help you.
did they send you?
do you hit me on purpose to see what would happen?
I don't know what you're talking about.
don't lie to me!
cause i'm sick of being lied to.
we won't lie to you, william.
no one's gonna lie to you.
he's a psych patient.
he took off this morning.
the air force asked me to try to round him up.
they mentioned an old green bronco, so i called your boss at work to see if you'd shown up, but...
did they ask you to keep this quiet?
Why?
because he told me a very different story.
I think you should hear it.
this is sheriff underlay.
would you mind telling him what you told me?
Hi.
you weren't in iraq, were you, son?
what are they doing here? i called them.
Hey, look, guys, there may have been a mistake.
I'm not sure this is your man.
Oh, he's our man, sir.
our colonel will be very grateful.
Hey.
how you feeling?
okay. better.
that's good.
Yeah, i never thought i'd say it, but i'm actually kind of psyched to be back at school.
brace yourself.
what do you mean?
it's just a whole different place.
