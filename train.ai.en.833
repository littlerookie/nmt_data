why are you doing this, Rocky?
I don't know, I'd rather do something I love badly than...
than to feel bad by not doing something you love.
rocky, the press has labeled you a Balboasaurus.
how do you feel about that?
let's say the following happens: You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.
you lose, say a thumb in the eye, you'll be the joke of the decade.
you all know that will never happen. This is only an exhibition.
don't go trying to make more out of this than that computer tried.
isn't this sport in enough trouble without these circus events?
next question. - On the surface, this looks like...
...a cheap bit of ring theater between, no offense...
...a has-been and a man whose own credible legacy...
...and popularity is in doubt.
what's the upside? - Doubt?
upside? I mean...
what do you mean, upside? I mean, what do I have to do?
you know, I'm 33-0 with 30 knockouts.
I'm doing you people a favor. I'm having this exhibition for you.
you gonna get up here and make a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.
I mean, I get pissed, this guy get hurt.
see you at the fight.
the guy's a joke. He's gonna get crushed.
look who's here. - How you doing?
have you seen my father? - He's in the back.
this place has never served this many meals. It's unbelievable.
you're doing good? Hope you're enjoying everything, all right?
excuse me.
how you doing? Glad you come by.
can I talk with you?
sure. - Can we do it outside?
so you're going through with this? - I start training tomorrow.
Hey, Rock. I made some connections.
I can make some money on this, endorsements.
Absolutely. Do that.
thank you, Rock. Okay. - Sure.
so you nervous about the fight? - Scared to death.
you don't look scared. - Well, I ain't supposed to.
then you don't have to do it.
Yeah, well, I think I do.
you know, living with you, it hasn't been easy.
people see me but they think of you.
now with all this going on, it's gonna be worse than ever.
it don't have to be. - Sure it does!
Why? You've got a lot going on, kid. - What, my last name?
that's the reason I got a decent job.
that's why people deal with me in the first place.
now I start to get a little ahead...
...I start to get a little something for myself, and this happens.
now, I'm asking you as a favor not to go through with this.
this is gonna end up bad for you, and it's gonna end up bad for me.
you think I'm hurting you? - Yeah. In a way, you are.
that's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
I know that's not what you wanna do, but that's just the way that it is.
don't you care what people think? Doesn't it bother you that people are making you out to be a joke and that I'll be included in that?
do you think that's right? Do you?
you ain't gonna believe this, but you used to fit right here.
I'd hold you up and say to your mother:
this kid is gonna be the best kid in the world.
this kid is gonna be somebody better than anybody ever knew.
and you grew up good and wonderful.
it was great just watching, every day was like a privilege.
then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world...
...and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed.
you stopped being you.
you let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good.
and when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame...
...like a big shadow.
let me tell you something you already know.
the world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
it's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are...
...it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it.
you, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.
but it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit...
...and keep moving forward.
how much you can take and keep moving forward.
that's how winning is done!
if you know what you're worth, go and get what you're worth.
but you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers...
...saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody!
cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!
I'm always gonna love you no matter what.
no matter what happens.
you're my son and you're my blood.
you're the best thing in my life.
but until you start believing in yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.
don't forget to visit your mother.
Yeah, those are beautiful. - Yeah.
you get off early from work? - No.
I left.
I quit.
quit, why?
I wasn't very...
I don't know, I just... I didn't fit in there.
I understand.
so, what are you gonna do? - Right now?
right now I'd rather be with you.
is that all right?
Yeah.
it's been a long time since I seen a fight.
you know all there is to know about fighting...
you know all there is to know about fighting...
...so there's no sense us going down that same old road again.
to beat this guy, you need speed. You don't have it.
and your knees can't take the pounding, so hard running is out.
and you got arthritis in your neck. And you've got calcium deposits...
...on most of your joints, so sparring is out.
I had that problem.
so what we'll be calling on is good old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.
horsepower. Heavy-duty, cast-iron, pile-driving punches...
...that will have to hurt so much they'll rattle his ancestors.
every time you hit him with a shot...
...It's gotta feel like he tried kissing the express train.
Yeah! Let's start building some hurting bombs.
Yeah, you'll get it. - You can do it, Rocko!
getting stronger!
up! Up! Up! - Come on!
go!
Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah!
come on, Rock!
come on. Come on. Let's hit them. Hit them.
you can do it, Rock.
getting stronger!
up, up, up! - Go! Go!
all right!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!
rocky Balboa, 217!
the undisputed heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon, 221!
thank you very much. I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
know how much money is in this? - A lot of it.
imagine trying to clean this place.
no, seriously. - Balboa!
you guys, I'll catch up with you all later, okay?
Robert, why don't you hang with me?
how you doing, champ? - I'm good.
no reason for neither one of us to get hurt in this fight.
I'll do my best to carry you, make sure you save face.
there'd be no embarrassment.
but I promise you, you try to press me, you hit me, you hurt me...
...you hit me low, cheap-shot me, I'll get you out of there.
you know, a lot of people come to Vegas to lose. I didn't.
it's already over.
ain't nothing over till it's over.
what's that from, the '80s?
that's probably the '70s.
just remember what I said.
Hey, yo, champ.
yo, ain't you a little scared?
I don't get scared.
I think you try a little harder when you're scared.
this is what has worked for me.
I ain't scared. - Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?
come on, let's see what you got. Come on.
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.
Hey. - Hi.
how you doing? - I was just thinking.
did you wanna come in? - No, no, no, it's okay.
I just wanted to...
...I don' t know, come by and wish you good luck for tomorrow.
Thanks. - Yeah.
I brought you something.
I hope you don't mind, I took it from the restaurant.
no. - Thanks.
Adrian.
Yeah. Thought she would keep you safe.
Yeah. Yeah, she always brought me luck.
Yeah.
I wanted to say thanks for everything you've done for me and my kid.
you've been great and...
you know, tomorrow...
...you're gonna prove that the last thing to age on somebody is their heart.
I'll try. - You go show them.
thank you.
the heavyweight championship has been...
...one of sports' most coveted titles for 120 years.
two-time heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa...
...the Philadelphia slugger, renowned for his cast-iron jaw...
...ferocious body attack and will of steel...
...all of which have carried the smaller fighter to victories...
...over the years against physically superior opponents.
and Mason Dixon, the current heavyweight title holder...
...with all the speed, determination and confidence any fighter could want.
but many still question whether he has the heart of a true champion...
...never having been pushed to go the distance. Tonight, we find out.
here at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas...
...for the much-anticipated showdown...
...between Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...and Rocky "The Italian Stallion" Balboa.
Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...
...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...
...one of the most outrageous and compelling events in boxing history.
the unappreciated heavyweight champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...putting his reputation on the line...
...against legendary ex-champion, Rocky Balboa.
even though most see this as more of a glorified sparring session...
...the energy in the room is electric.
Larry, why is this billed as an exhibition?
wild guess: So they wouldn't have to call it an execution.
Zacariah 4: 6 says, "It is not by strength, not by might
...but by his spirit we have already claimed the victory...
...in our Lord Jesus Christ.
good luck, Rocky.
Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.
nobody's expecting much, I think, from the way-past-his-prime...
...former champ, Rocky Balboa.
rock, I gotta talk to you.
look, I know you got a lot of stuff you gotta get out of your system.
tonight you do it. Right? Get rid of the damn beast...
...Let it be done, once and for all. Please, I love you.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
there go the lights. The buzz is building toward a roaring crescendo.
where did that come from?
I told you. I love Sinatra.
he's very good, Sinatra.
let's go. - Very good.
and here comes Rocky Balboa, veteran of the wars...
...Here for one more last hurrah.
or the Last Supper, perhaps, with him as the main course.
what's that music? You can't be serious.
high Hopes"? Talk about wishful thinking.
well, maybe no hopes is more realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.
look at the Italian Stallion. Cool and relaxed.
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog, and they don't care at all.
this is about his pride and dignity and his punch, guys.
the last thing to go is a guy's punch.
rocky always has that puncher's chance.
rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear, the people's champion.
prediction, guys: For at least two rounds...
...Dixon's gonna have his hands full.
two whole rounds? We have a cockeyed optimist in the house.
how you doing? - The crowd wants to see...
...something real, or at least...
rocky Balboa just asked me how I'm doing.
I grew up watching this guy. I never thought I'd be calling one of his fights.
this is unbelievable. I'm a fan, I can't help it.
now here comes Mason Dixon.
Mason Dixon establishing his presence in the ring.
and suddenly now a conversation breaking out at ringside.
Mike Tyson calling out Mason "The Line" Dixon.
you can't call no shots here. I'm the champ.
you not doing nothing. This is charity work.
you got that midget with you right there.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Mandalay Bay...
...resort and casino of Las Vegas.
and a special main event of the evening...
...10 rounds of heavyweight excitement...
...sanctioned by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
and when the bell rings, the referee in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.
and now, for the thousands in attendance...
...and the millions watching around the world, ladies and gentlemen...
...let's get ready to rumble!
introducing first, fighting out of the blue corner...
...wearing black with gold, official weight, 217 pounds.
his professional record, 57 victories including 54 knockouts...
...with 23 defeats and one draw.
he is the fighting pride of Philadelphia...
...the two-time heavyweight champion of the world...
..."The Italian Stallion..."
...Rocky...
...Balboa!
hope he gets his head busted.
shut up.
across the ring, fighting out of the red corner...
...wearing white with blue, official weight, 221 pounds.
he has a perfect professional record, consisting of 33 bouts...
...33 victories, including 30 knockouts.
originally from Tampa, Florida...
...but now fighting out of Las Vegas, Nevada...
...the reigning undisputed, undefeated...
...heavyweight champion of the world...
...Mason "The Line..."
...Dixon!
all right, gentlemen.
all right, Mason, Rocky. We went over the rules in the dressing room.
I expect a good, clean fight. Watch the kidney punches, rabbit punches...
...low blows, be careful with those. Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.
remember, gentlemen, I'm fair but I'm firm. Touch them up!
enjoy the ride. - The champ is not in the best shape...
...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans to phone this in and go home early.
that wouldn't be a surprise. - Glad you could make it.
one thing about Rocky we know for sure:
this guy's showing up in shape.
the old man's crazy. - He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.
okay. - Take it easy. This is an exhibition.
all right? Do it to him.
you got three rounds to set a pace. Every time you hit him, make a dent.
got it. - The moments before a Rocky Balboa fight? I can't believe it's here!
round one begins.
if old George Foreman shocked the world with one punch...
...why can't old Rocky Balboa?
and as much excitement as there is in the arena...
...there's a sense of foreboding as well.
and now, Mason "The Line" Dixon goes to work with his jab as though...
...he's fighting against the number one challenger in the heavyweight division.
see, this is to be expected early on.
you knew the champ would control the distance with his jab...
...his height, his range.
Balboa looking to get in a shot, misses wildly.
did you like that?
it looks like a speed bag against a punching bag.
Rocky's understandably frustrated...
...but he came out of retirement to get into a fight.
guys named Rocky don't like to be toyed with.
one punch could still turn it around.
apparently he forgot his arthritis meds this morning.
rocky misses.
there's a meat-seeking missile on the point of the chin by the champ.
more pinpoint jabs by Dixon. - Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
and there's a hard right hand and a left and a right by Balboa!
he drives Dixon into the ropes with a series of shots!
and the crowd goes berserk!
Dixon punishing Balboa for the temerity of landing those shots.
it's toe to toe in the corner. Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.
Balboa landing potent combinations to the head of the champion.
a wake-up call for Dixon.
you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right.
the man's got bricks in his gloves. - Where's the stuff in the basement?
it's still there. - He came to battle, okay?
trying to knock me out. - Listen.
if there's a bone he can break, he's gonna do it.
give the man respect. - What about my respect?
CompuBox numbers tell the grisly story here.
Balboa landed nine of 13 punches in that round.
Dixon landed an incredible 59 out of 69.
why don't you listen to me? - Rocky's been here a million times.
coming out to start a round after he took a beating in the previous one.
remember what I said, okay? - I warned him. I warned him.
he's tired. His legs are going fast, or already gone.
and what's truly extraordinary is that Rocky can still take it.
the boxing commission, which was criticized for licensing him would be massacred if something happened to Rocky.
and a monstrous straight left hand! Down goes Rocky!
and that could conceivably be the end of the fight!
that could be the exhibition right there. But no. Balboa up.
referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants to continue, and Rocky says yes.
even Rocky Balboa could be too brave for his own good.
Dixon comes right back to try to finish it. Balboa almost went down!
rocky actually shoves Dixon back.
as Dixon lands these brutal shots.
cover up! Cover up! - Open shots at close range.
right and left hands, and down goes Balboa!
perhaps for the last time in his fighting career!
that should do it. - Three! Four!
get up! Get up! - Seven!
how do you feel, man? You okay? - Now Rocky is furious with himself.
he convinces Cortez he wants to keep fighting.
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.
rocky waving his arms and saying he's fine.
he wants to go on! - Let it go! Let it go!
and Balboa comes back! With a left and a right...
...and bulls Dixon into the ropes for the second round in a row!
back comes Dixon with brutal left-hand shots.
Dixon hurt his hand there! - Go after him!
this is Rocky's best chance!
the champ obviously hurt his hand on Rocky's hip!
and Balboa immediately going to work to the body! Huge right hook!
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body! These are big punches.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
Yes!
rocky Balboa has knocked the reigning heavyweight champion down!
you hurt him! - Mason "The Line" Dixon...
...has never taken this kind of punishment...
...in his entire professional career!
maybe he's clearing his head, but the body shots really caved in his ribs.
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!
another counterhook by Balboa, followed by two more!
Dixon fires back his own hooks! Now Rocky's stunned.
it's an all-out war along the ropes...
...as round two comes to a close amid a giant tumult in the ring!
incredible.
all right!
welcome to Rockyland.
how's the hand? - My hand's broken.
we lose, it's your ass! Your ass!
it will numb up on you in a few rounds.
once that hand numbs up, Dixon will be able to throw it hard.
until then, here is Rocky's chance.
no reverse! - Take the pain, champ.
stay on him! Everybody thought this was a joke, including me!
now nobody's laughing! Stay on him! You go get him!
go out strong!
keep him off you!
that's it! That's it!
you won that round. Break him down.
bomb him! Bomb him!
Yeah!
just keep throwing them bombs!
come on.
you can do this.
Rocko. Rocko.
Yeah, come on, go!
go through him! Run over him!
unload on him!
get down, Mason!
they're leaving nothing on the table, guys.
the fans are still standing. They may not be able to sit down for a week.
you're doing great! - I'm doing better than I thought.
you sure he's okay? - I've had worse.
toe to toe, one round to go. Who would've believed this was possible?
can you see out of that eye? - Let me talk to him.
don't take any more chances than you have to.
there's nothing more to prove, Pop. There's nothing more to prove.
I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.
you can do it, Rocko!
one more round, we go home. - Okay, then do it.
there's an old saying that every great champion has...
...one great fight left in him, and Rocky is proving it so far.
come on. Touch them up. - Rocko! The last round of your life!
come on, guys. - The last round!
come on. Touch them up, let's go. Touch them up.
you are one crazy old man. - You'll get there.
let's go.
tenth round of a scheduled 10. Who would ever have dreamed...
...that Rocky Balboa would still be in this quote, "exhibition," against...
...the heavyweight champion? - You can do it! Come on!
this fight is as though Dixon got on-the-job training in courage.
cover up! Cover up! - They're both in a pain-free zone!
these guys are fighting in another dimension right now!
beyond belief! Balboa just walking straight into Dixon's punches.
target practice for Dixon.
they're exchanging right hooks! Balboa's drilled!
here comes Dixon! He's exhausted from just punching the man!
knock this bum out, Mase!
what is it you said to the kid? It ain't about how hard you hit.
it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.
how much you can take and keep moving forward.
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! - Get up.
let's go! Get up! - Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
get up.
another monster body shot. Rocky's ancestors must have felt that one.
come on, Rocky! Start moving those hands!
less than two minutes to go.
the crowd is astonished that Balboa got up.
come on! - Turn it over! All the way through!
and retaliates with fury!
chop him down!
come on, Rocky! Come on!
take him out now!
they're trading shots again!
Balboa is trying to hit anything and anywhere!
win it! Win it!
Yes!
Yes!
you're a great champion. You got heart.
thanks for the opportunity. Good man.
that was unbelievable. That was the greatest thing I've ever seen.
you did it. That's the kind of fighting you're talking about.
Hey, Paulie.
that beast is gone now. The beast is out.
one of the most overused words in sports, guys, is "incredible.
I hate to say it. This is incredible.
let's go!
ladies and gentlemen, before we go to the scorecards...
...a round of applause for these two heavyweight warriors!
we have a split decision.
adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94...
...Dixon.
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94...
...Balboa.
and Bill Graham scores it 95-94...
...for the winner by split decision, and still undefeated...
...the heavyweight champion of the world...
Mason "The Line" Dixon!
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
you know, I couldn't have done nothing without you.
he was a marine biologist or at least in training.
his father studied great white sharks and called his son " Sharkboy " because of how much he loved to care for the sharks.
he made them sushi and had given them all names.
Goodmilk. Peggy. Eggbat...
and Crackett.
but one day an incredible mysterious storm appeared.
it swept away the entire laboratory.
Sharkboy!
thanks to their life rafts. Sharkboy and his father survived.
but they survived on different sides of the wreckage.
each floating off in a different direction.
Sharkboy!
Sharkboy was completely alone.
almost completely.
but one of the sharks recognized him.
Hey, it's Sharkboy.
don't take a bite outta him, boys, he's a friend.
they took Sharkboy to their cave home. Where he'd be safe and dry.
his new family were sharks.
hundreds of sharks.
the sharks raised him as one of their own.
training him in the ways of the shark.
you must keep moving to survive.
aIways go forward, never back.
to live by instinct and instinct alone.
eventually he grew gills and sharp talons for claws.
his teeth sharpened themselves to a point.
he grew fins. --All sorts of fins.
but that was years ago.
I first met Sharkboy while fishing on the dock this summer.
he seemed lost.
you have to get a job! -- No, I have a job!
so I snuck him home...
then maybe you shouId just Ieave when my parents were too busy to notice.
I kept him fed and in water.
he had been traveling the universe in search of his father.
he told me of his latest adventures on a planet so cool it makes you drool.
he said I too could go to Planet Drool someday.
then one night I was visited by a glowing light.
an amazing girl with purple flames for hair and skin of molten lava rock appeared.
I called her...
LavagirI.
she smiled at me for that seemed to be her name.
she told me she needed Sharkboy to return to Planet Drool with her for a great crisis was developing.
she asked if I could go with them. I told her: " I have school tomorrow. "
she gave me a sad look and flamed away.
taking Sharkboy with her.
I haven't seen Sharkboy or Lavagirl since then.
and that's what I did this summer.
enough!
someone is picking that up. And it's not gonna be me!
we were supposed to teII true stories.
that is a true story.
does LavagirI have speciaI powers? -- There's no such thing as LavagirI.
she can...
she can shoot Iava out of her hands.
cooI.
how many peopIe think Max's story is true?
not true. -- Made up.
not true. -- It's just a made-up story.
if it's true, why don't you bring Sharkboy and LavagirI to cIass tomorrow?
they went away. I don't know where they went.
have a seat, Max.
Linus, you're next.
this summer, I met a new friend... Who was haIf dork, haIf boy.
I caIIed him Dorkboy.
but his reaI name was Max.
we had him for dinner, but he stunk so bad that we aII bIew chunks.
that's enough, Linus.
Linus, Max, stay.
come on, Mr. E!
cIass, what's my name?
Mr. EIectricidad.
Mr. EIectricidad, exactIy.
not Mr. EIectric, not Mr. EIectrici-tha-tha-tha-tha.
Linus, you just earned a minus for your behavior today.
this is a new year. Do you think you can be friends?
no.
then it's been decided, you'II be the best of friends.
which means no more picking on Max, Linus.
Max.
you're in the fourth grade. There are some good kids in this cIass.
find them. Make friends with them.
dreaming keeps you from seeing what's right here in front of you.
this isn't a dream. This is the reaI worId.
lost my train of thought.
no dreaming. Got it.
I'II try harder.
what do you have there?
it's my dream journaI.
it has aII of my most precious dreams in it.
I'II never part with it for as Iong as I Iive.
you're a good kid, Max.
Max!
let's be imaginary friends.
you can try and hang with us... and we'II pretend you don't exist!
check it out. Sharkboy gets shocked by eIectric eeIs, and then they feed on his cooked fIesh.
wow, Linus.
your skiIIs are... weak.
I'm gonna burst your bubbIe, Dream Boy.
you're dead!
get the book!
give me the book.
hand over the book, or you'II visit the dream worId!
aII right! Got it!
I'II bring you a revised edition tomorrow.
Max. wake up! -- Dream. Max.
open your eyes. Max. -- Eyes open and dream. Stay dreaming.
wake up!
Sharkboy!
and LavagirI!
Max!
my cookies! My giant cookies!
what are you doing baking sweets? You know what happens when he eats sugar.
I baked them for his cIass.
so you couId make friends at schooI, and now you've eaten aII of them.
no, it was Sharkboy and LavagirI!
look, this one has shark bites, and this one is singed.
there's no such thing as Sharkboy and LavagirI.
weII, I beIieve him.
your mother's right. When you go to sIeep and cIose your eyes, they may come back.
but when you open them again, SharkgirI and Lavaboy wiII be...outta here.
but... -- Shh. Mouth cIosed, eyes cIosed.
now? -- Yes, now.
you can wait tiII you're in bed to cIose your eyes, Max.
kids need their dreams.
kids... need to grow up!
he's not making any friends with these cookies!
there's no such thing as Sharkboy and LavagirI.
there's no such thing as Sharkboy and LavagirI.
Yes, there is.
stupid pIugs!
pIease don't Iet me have to go to schooI. They'II make fun of me, I know it!
I wish I couId just escape this Ioser worId and go to PIanet DrooI.
games and toys and Iaughs and fun...
may there be terribIe storms, rain, sIeet, snow, tornadoes...
so I can Iay here aII day tomorrow and dream of DrooI.
guess I didn't dream hard enough.
there are pIenty of good opportunities. You just need to Iook.
Ooh, traffic engineer!
I was cIeaning out my cIoset and Iook what I found.
remember Tobor? The robot you tried to buiId?
why were you cIeaning out your cIoset?
I had to find one of these.
is mom making you get a reaI job again? -- Writing is a reaI job.
when it pays. -- Max, I'm waIking you to schooI today.
so what do you say? Wanna finish making Tobor?
it won't work.
weII, how do you know? -- 'Cause you toId me it wouIdn't.
I did?
I'm sorry. I shouId've never said that.
it's ok. You were right.
dumb idea.
how did these happen?
the grass was dead anyway.
why are you so morbid?
I just wish anything couId happen so I wouIdn't have to go to schooI today.
that's not reaIistic, Max.
it's bad enough your father's head is in the cIouds, but not you too, ok?
just push that dream aside and move on.
like with your dream? The one about you and dad and me?
weII, I do have a dream about us, but, as I'm sure you've been noticing IateIy, your father and I are just...
weII, we're... not compatibIe.
sorry. I don't mean to dump aII this on you right before you have to go to schooI, but...schooI's waiting.
did we have to move so cIose to schooI?
your father thought we'd save money on gas.
come right home after schooI today, 'cause there's some things we need to taIk about.
I Iove you.
I wish anything couId happen so I wouIdn't have to come home today.
Hey, Iook, it's Dream Boy!
who knows where tornadoes come from?
weII, when coId air mixes with hot air, it can form a tornado, as the hot and coId chase each other around and around and around.
I dreamed of a story kind of Iike Sharkboy and LavagirI -- Ice GirI and Dream Boy.
her powers come from her crystaI heart.
no more fairy taIes.
piranha GirI and BeIuga Boy.
pIastic Boy and MetaI GirI.
barf Boy and Vomit GirI.
does everyone hear me? I'm a teacher, right?
wrong. I'm an awakener.
onIy I'm finding it more and more difficuIt to keep my cIass awake.
no recess again for you, Marissa - too many aIIergies.
there are more boogers on your work than there is work.
I'm just coId.
I'II be happy to change pIaces with you. It's a Iot warmer back there in my spot.
but I... have to sit up front.
it's just that you're sitting right under the vent.
it's August and you're sneezing. -- You're gonna get me in troubIe.
Max.
are you... trying to make reaI friends?
trying, Iike you toId me to.
that's good. Just not with my daughter, ok?
No! It wasn't Iike that. It's just...
sit down, Max.
give me back my journaI! -- CIass has begun. Everyone in your seats.
linus took my journaI! -- I did not!
minus! I mean, Linus.
you get a minus for misconduct. Give Max back his journaI.
one more time, Linus, and we'II have to change your name to Minus.
he ruined my dream journaI!
I did not! Mr. EIectric, send him to the principaI's office and have him expeIIed!
you're in my cIass, not the other way around!
I know everything and you know nothing!
at the end of cIass, both of you report to the principaI's office!
with your parents!
everybody down!
it's them!
I'm Iooking for Max.
she's hot!
we need your heIp, Max. Come with us.
what do I have to do?
go with us to PIanet DrooI. We'II expIain on the way.
we're going to PIanet DrooI?
it's my home pIanet. Just outside our soIar system.
you shouId know, Max - you made it up.
I can't go with you. -- Why not?
because you're not reaI. Both of you are just a dream.
and when I open my eyes, you'II be gone.
we're stiII here, Max.
if you wanna stop the darkness from destroying our worIds, come with us.
you better go with them.
OK... I'II go.
everyone foIIow me and we'II find sheIter.
I can't beIieve I'm finaIIy getting to ditch this pIace and go to PIanet DrooI!
how are we getting there?
put these on, everybody.
bIue goggIes for the boys, pink for the girIs.
do you have another pair of boy goggIes?
so, how do you fIy it?
you don't know? -- Duh!
that's sort of been the whoIe probIem!
you press go.
now, how do you fIy it? -- It's got an autopiIot.
you just thought of everything, didn't you, Max?
not exactIy.
how do we Iand it? -- That's the part I never thought of!
Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...
you might wanna hoId on to something.
recognize your dream worId, Max?
not reaIIy.
I feeI Iike I shouId, but I just don't.
it's affecting him too.
I thought he wouId just remember.
remember what? -- Your dreams. This pIanet?
us.
your powers.
I have powers? -- More than any of us.
don't you know that?
everything that is or was, began with a dream.
and you dreamed us, Max. Us and this whoIe pIace.
I did?
every dream you ever had Ianded right here on PIanet DrooI.
why is it so dark?
the pIanet is dying. It began yesterday.
what's the caIcuIation, Sharkboy?
45 minutes tiII the darkness destroys PIanet DrooI.
we didn't go to Earth to save you. Max. We need you to save PIanet DrooI.
but how?
the Dream Lair is on the other side of the pIanet.
that's where your dreams are going bad. We have to go there and reverse it.
we have to traveI through the passage of time, catch the train of thought, swim down the Stream of Consciousness and skate across the Sea of Confusion - now covered in ice.
why'd you do that, Max? Why'd you freeze the ocean?
I...
Max didn't mean to do it. Did you, Max?
Max is a good boy, otherwise you and I wouId be eviI, and we're not eviI.
I'm not eviI, am I, Max?
I don't think so.
that's why we brought you here - to put things back in order.
we just have to stay positive. It's not the end of the worId.
not yet, it's not.
the darkness! Run!
this is Iike a bad dream!
Oh, yeah? Just wait tiII you meet Mr. EIectric! He's the worst bad dream yet!
where is everyone?
mostiy trapped on Mount Neverrest. -- By Mr. EIectric.
but PIanet DrooI's a pIace for kids to dream and have endIess fun!
it's endIess fun, aII right. Once you get on...you can't get off.
kids aren't aIIowed to rest, 'cause if they rest, they sIeep, and if they sIeep, they dream.
and if they dream... -- It takes power away from Mr. EIectric.
but we're gonna stop him with our secret weapon.
shouIdn't we save those kids first?
why can't I do that?
LavagirI! Hooray!
who knows where Mr. EIectric is hiding?
everyone?
they're not raising their hands. You're aII upside down.
who is stopping my unstoppable coasters?
back in your seats! -- Go! Run! Hide!
let's get outta here! -- Everyone back in your seats!
who's Mr. EIectric?
he's supposed to provide Iight to the pIanet, but aII he brings now is darkness.
fun has begun!
he's taking us up!
my home! At haIf its normaI power.
he's taking us down.
show time!
keep pIaying! Never stop!
games and toys and Iaughs... hey-hey-hey... and fun!
weII, weII, weII. If it isn't Sharkboy and LavagirI.
what are you doing haIting my endIess-fun coaster and infiItrating my Iair?
we don't need permission from you.
fiery!
I don't beIieve we've met. I'm Mr. EIectric!
why are you bringing misery to our pIanet? You're supposed to be running it.
you're supposed to be running it. I am running it - right into the ground.
those are my orders. - Who ordered that?
no schooI, no discipIine, no ruIes. And, most important, no dreams.
dreams can destroy you, can't they?
my instincts teII me that is so. -- ReaIIy?
that's why we have to stop you. -- You and what army?
now? -- Now.
feeI the burn!
not for reaI. Aaah!
internai radar, shark-Iike refIexes... You're amazing!
but is it enough to defeat Mr. EIectric?
we have our secret weapon, remember?
did you reaIIy beIieve you couId stop me?
I know we can't. But he can.
take it away, Max.
show him what you're made of, Max. -- What am I supposed to do?
I toId you this wouId happen. -- I thought he wouId just remember.
remember what?!
the dream. Remember the dream.
I don't remember haIf my dreams.
that's why I write them in my dream journaI.
what haIf of your dreams do you remember?
this one I remember.
where are you taking us?
where aII useIess dreams go - to the Dream Graveyard!
Cuckoo!
weII, at Ieast we're on the passage of time.
maybe it'II take us to the Dream Lair.
it's going in the wrong direction. The Dream Lair's that way.
what's in the Dream Lair?
it's where aII the dreams that fueI PIanet DrooI are stored.
but they're being destroyed.
how? -- That's what we have to find out.
soon even Sharkboy and I wiII cease to exist.
duck!
Max, where is your dream journaI?
great thinking, Sharkie!
we can read his dreams out Ioud and turn everything back to the way it was.
I may even reaIize my true identity.
I threw it away.
my journaI's back on Earth.
we reaIIy thought you were the answer, Max.
don't Iisten to him. He's just upset because you didn't show up and make him king of the ocean, with a giant fish army to back him up.
look who's taIking!
you thought you'd find a great use for your powers and heaI the pIanet.
Max thought his dream worId wouId be a happy pIace. We've aII been duped.
I think you broke my fin.
sorry.
Hey, you! I see you hiding! Come back here!
I was awakened!
I'm sorry.
did aII the chiIdren from Mount Neverrest escape?
it was Sharkboy and LavagirI. But I took care of it - see?
someone was with them?
just another chiId afraid of his own shadow. No threat to us.
I banished him to the Dream Graveyard.
where oId dreams Iie? He couId find an aIIy!
I toId you, every dream must be smashed, every chiId captured!
you want him back, we'II simpIy track him when he faIIs asIeep.
fooI! He's the Daydreamer.
and the moment he reaIizes it wiII be the moment of our doom!
now what do you want me to do?
bring me the boy before he discovers his true powers and tears my new kingdom apart!
PIugs, redirect the darkness.
And...bring me the PIughounds!
we'II never find our way out of this graveyard.
darkness! Headed this way!
sit down, Max.
what for? -- CIose your eyes and dream.
if Max can't remember his dreams, maybe he can redream them.
he couId dream us out of here.
dream, Max.
now, what do you see?
I see a... giant... chocoIate-chunk marshmaIIow cookie...with Iots of warm miIk.
sorry. I'm starving. - Here's some food.
you're not gonna Iike that. -- I'm so hungry I couId eat Iava rocks.
what is that?!
lava rocks.
here, have some reaI food. Fresh sushi.
it'II knock you right out. -- That's not fresh.
I'm not even sure that's sushi anymore.
it's just a few weeks oId. -- I'II cook it for you.
it's ok. I'm not that hungry anymore.
let me just rest a moment. Maybe I can sIeep.
it's getting cIoser.
get outta here!
Max, I know you've got a Iot to figure out, but if you happen to dream about who I am and how I fit into this worId, it wouId reaIIy be heIpfuI for me...
no distractions. You steer him off course, we couId be Iost in a sea of dreams.
I'm sorry. I'm desperate. -- Focus on the probIem at hand.
Max needs to dream us out of here, so how about I put him to sIeep?
no, Sharkboy. -- Just one punch. He'II be out Iike a Iight.
I've seen this before. It's on the tip of my... finger.
it's a hand!
it is a hand.
a hand?
another hand.
it's Tobor! - Who?
Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid a robot that couId heIp me with my homework.
I tried to buiId him once. Everyone kept teIIing me he wouId never work.
so here he is - a forgotten dream in the Dream Graveyard.
maybe he can heIp us.
he's supposed to be very smart.
Tobor, awake!
he works!
we can ask him anything now. -- Let me, Iet me!
teII me something about me. I'm cIueIess.
actuaIIy, you are extremeIy bright.
am I king of the ocean, or what?
no. Sorry.
how do I save PIanet DrooI?
the answer is in your dreams.
you mean if I put him to sIeep, he'II dream us out of this mess?
no. At Ieast, not here.
darkness is faIIing. Any dream of his wouId become a nightmare and you don't want those becoming a reaIity.
but if you go to the Land of MiIk and Cookies...
of course! That's where the good dreams are.
where the answers are.
it's perfect, Max.
the Land of MiIk and Cookies is a safe, sweet pIace.
you'II be abIe to dream easiIy there.
can you take us?
I have no body. I can't move.
you can move your eyes and your mouth.
why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?
some dreams are so powerfuI they become reaI - Iike Sharkboy and LavagirI.
I, on the other hand, am stiII onIy a dream.
Oh...
what's wrong? -- Train of thought... I'm Iosing it.
you were taking us to the Land of MiIk and Cookies, remember?
I mean I'm IiteraIIy Iosing the train of thought. It's down there.
that's the train of thought? How do I keep it on track?
with your mind. The train of thought gets easiIy distracted.
stay focused, and it'II speed you directIy to the Land of MiIk and Cookies.
the rest is up to you.
sorry I forgot about you, Tobor.
are you kidding? You just saved me.
I'm free!
Max, get down here!
what's wrong? --We can't controI it.
aII you have to do is keep it on track.
how can you keep it on track if there is no track?
looks Iike another dream gone bad!
what do we do?
yeII? Scream?
jump. It'II be aII right.
what does it mean when your train of thought... wrecks?
weII... It can't be good, buddy.
how much time do we have, Sharkboy?
20 minutes.
stick to rotten fish, pIease!
chocoIate! I stepped in chocoIate!
we're here.
the Land of MiIk and Cookies!
Oh, yeah!
the miIk is warm. He'II be out in no time.
lay down. Here's a marshmallow piIIow.
how about dreaming us into the Dream Lair?
the ground is thumping too much.
my highIy trained ears hear it too.
boom, boom, boom.
let me hear it. -- I wouIdn't.
hothead.
when you dreamt up these giant cookies, who did you expect to be abIe to eat them?
I reaIIy didn't think about it.
cause if you dream giant cookies, something has to be created to consume giant cookies.
cookie giants!
frosting.
those giants aImost Iook Iike my parents.
they seem happy together. Is that your dream?
we had a dream we're famiIy. It hasn't been coming true IateIy.
most dreams don't come true on their own. You have to make them true.
it takes a Iot of work. Not easy.
but not impossibIe either.
stinking fresh air!
BIinding sunIight!
Oh, how I long for a sky of fluorescent lights!
better stand back.
aII right, that was me.
stiII empty-handed, I see. -- If you're so powerfuI, you find him.
that's your job! Do it, or I'II have you discharged!
someone is dreaming in here.
aII right, Max, you've had your cookies and miIk. Now go to sIeep.
I'II try.
go to sIeep!
not Iike that. Sing him a lullaby.
dream, dream, dream, dream...
your turn.
cIose your eyes, shut your mouth, dream a dream and get us out dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream Hit the hay, fast asIeep, dream a dream, you IittIe bleep dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream...
it's working! Keep it up, Sharkboy.
just reIax, Iay about, or my fist wiII put you out Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream Take your time, but beware, there's darkness in the air Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream
dream about me next, Max.
I need to know who I am.
not just destruction or a simpIe fIame.
dream of me as something good.
don't despair, step right up gIass of water? Here's a cup dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream...
he's having a nightmare! Wake up, Max! Wake up!
stop that racket, Sharkboy - you're giving him nightmares!
sorry, Max.
what was that for?
your nightmare was about me, wasn't it?
I don't remember.
but I did dream about one thing...
PIughounds!
this may come as a shock to you.
feeI the power!
it's empty!
fudge.
I forgot to dream of gas.
Max!
my powers are weakening.
watch the power Iines - very dangerous.
Sharkboy, get me down from here!
can't you see I'm busy?
hot Iava... Hot Iava...
I don't got much fight Ieft in me, Max.
Where's LavagirI?
it's up to you now, Max.
dream us out of here.
we beIieve in you, Max.
shark boat with turbo boosters! Shark boat with turbo boosters!
a banana split?!
stiII hungry, Max? How about a knuckle sandwich?
no, Iook!
it's a banana-spIit boat!
then Iet's spIit!
catch you Iater.
aII dreamers must dream.
this is great, Max. You're starting to daydream.
keep that up, and they'II never get us.
why not?
learn to dream with your eyes open, and you won't have to be asIeep to dream.
you'II be abIe to make anything happen at any time.
row, row, row your banana-spIit boat gentIy down the stream of consciousness, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy, merriIy, life is Max's dream.
sugar wiII give you nightmares.
how much time do we have? -- Don't ask.
the Dream Lair's across the Ocean of Ice. We'II have to traveI there by foot.
what was it you saw in your dream, Max?
I saw an object shaped Iike...
give me something to draw with.
the CrystaI Heart!
that's the treasure of the Land of Ice! In the Ice CastIe.
it can freeze anything - even time.
I've aIways dreamt of freezing a moment in time.
and the Ice CastIe's ruIed by the Ice Princess.
I hear she's the most beautifuI girI on the pIanet.
she is not! She's coId and crueI and cares for nobody but herseIf.
she's just saying that, Max.
have you met her? -- No. But I know we don't get aIong.
how do you know that? -- I'm fire. She's ice.
we must be enemies.
we need that CrystaI Heart.
but I need you both to get it.
I just hope this isn't a trap.
if we freeze time with the CrystaI Heart, we'II be abIe to make it to the Dream Lair and save the pIanet.
that's the pIan.
behold the Ice CastIe!
home to the Princess of the Land of Ice.
the CrystaI Heart's inside the castIe? -- So they say.
let's go.
it's no use! I'II meIt the bridge.
this pIace inflames me.
can you cooI down enough to get across?
I'd have to be asIeep to do that.
can you try sIeepwaIking?
my dream is to Iive on Earth - but somepIace warm and that Earth wiII accept me, even... if I... destroy... everything I... touch!
no, LavagirI! Don't sneeze!
look.
she's sIeeping.
they've found us again! LavagirI! - Shh!
if you wake her up, she'II reheat.
she can make it.
LavagirI, they're behind you!
let's go. Hurry! - Argh!
it's a trap!
you can aImost feeI the eIectricity in the air, can't you?
this is aII wrong. Someone eIse's dreams are in here.
lights out!
weIcome to the Dream Lair!
I am the ruIer of PIanet DrooI.
no, you're not! Max is!
Max may have dreamed it originaIIy...but I am much... cooIer.
I... am Minus.
how'd you get so powerfuI?
I do a Iot of reading.
my book of dreams!
that's why everything's so messed up - he's changing it!
eIectric eels.
shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?
reminds me of the time that eIectricaI storm bIew apart your father's Iaboratory.
where is my father? -- Hm.
let's see.
check the bottom of the ocean.
and LavagirI...
once I figure out how to freeze this pIanet's core, aII of your powers wiII disappear.
powers? What powers?
and last but least, Max.
you thought you couId escape fear by running away to dreamIand.
but fear exists in the one pIace you can never escape!
your mind!
I wiII show you the true meaning of fear.
when darkness faIIs, the rest of your dreams wiII be destroyed and I wiII ruIe PIanet DrooI.
you must aII Ieave now. I have some dreaming to do.
if I couId just get my dream journaI, I couId turn everything back to the way it was.
my fire's dimming.
I can't meIt the bars.
my strength is faiIing me as weII.
how much time do we have, Sharkboy?
who cares? We're never getting out of here.
la La's.
they Iike you.
I don't feeI distracted right now. --I do!
this song is driving me crazy!
don't worry about him. He's a coId fish.
I'm serious!
they're singing at a frequency...my highIy trained ears find...disturbing!
sing Iouder. Sing higher.
you don't wanna be too cIose to him when he expIodes.
shark frenzy!
nice job channeIing your anger, Sharkie.
first things first. Transportation out of here.
my dreams.
LavagirI, you have a Iava bike!
I do?
I do!
this is so exciting!
cooI it, LavagirI.
everything we need is right here in this book.
Sharkboy... your father reaIIy is at the bottom of the ocean.
he's in a submarine.
looking for you!
he's over the hydrothermal vents, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, 42 degrees west by 14 north. Depth1800 meters.
near a snake pit!
I need to get back to Earth.
what's it say about me? -- I'm not sure what this is.
I can figure it out. Maybe there's a section on my true identity.
LavagirI, no!
Oh, no. What have I done?
that's terrific, LG!
it's ok, LavagirI. It was an accident.
why did you make me out of Iava?! Why, Max?
just Iet her cooI down. She's just bIowing off steam.
I know I can be good.
I can feeI it.
but everything I touch, I destroy.
why did you make me Iike that? I have more potentiaI.
I'm sure you do.
and why'd you make us a team? We're nothing aIike.
when I'm near water, I fizzle out. When he's near heat, he shrivels.
we're not compatible.
your... hair's on fire.
Yeah, it does that.
Thanks, Sharkie.
maybe I reaIIy am eviI.
so far everything eIse you've dreamed has been correct.
maybe I just need to Iearn to accept it.
that's it! Everything I've dreamed so far has been correct.
the CrystaI Heart!
Yeah, we were captured, but that's 'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it.
we have to get back to the Ice CastIe.
10 minutes Ieft. We'II never make it!
we can do it! -- How?
you're Sharkboy and LavagirI. You can do anything.
wake up!
what?
he escaped. And he's getting the CrystaI Heart.
shut it down. Shut it aII down now!
I did. It's on a grid system. It takes time for the darkness to traveI.
how soon? -- Not soon enough.
then destroy him. -- How?
by smashing his most precious dream: Sharkboy and LavagirI.
is that what you saw, Max?
Yes.
you'II have to cIimb the ice pillar and get it.
it's as deIicate as a snowflake, so don't drop it.
and don't touch it with your hands either - you'II freeze.
use your claws.
lava, can you...?
never mind.
chew on some ice. It'II keep you cooI.
great job, Max.
I got it!
she's frozen soIid!
kneei before the Ice Princess.
you tried to steaI the CrystaI Heart. Why?
we beIieve it can freeze time. Long enough for us to defeat Minus.
my CrystaI Heart cannot heIp you. OnIy I have the power to use it.
then come with us. -- She can never Ieave this castIe.
the crystaI is the onIy thing that protects our kingdom.
PIease, Princess. We're running out of time.
perhaps I couId give it to you.
not without my bIessing. -- Father, you're smothering me again.
but are you worthy to wield it?
Yes.
the crystaI you stoIe was a decoy.
the true CrystaI Heart is somewhere in this room.
choose the correct one, and you may carry it before you.
pick that one.
it's around your neck.
how'd you know? -- I saw it in my dream.
UsuaIIy, if you snooze, you Iose. With Max, you snooze, you win.
but be warned, Max, if anything happens to my CrystaI Heart, my entire kingdom wiII be destroyed.
do you, Max, take this CrystaI Heart to have and to hold, in sickness and in heaIth, tiII death do you part?
I do.
do you trust him with your heart? -- I do.
do you mean what you say?
Yes.
I mean, I do.
the crystaI wiII now work - but my daughter must stay here.
off with you, then!
good Iuck.
we're aImost at the Dream Lair!
if we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!
how much time? -- We're out of time!
10 seconds!
what?
I can't hear you.
five seconds. -- Here it goes.
we're out of time.
what happened? -- It didn't work.
how couId it not work?
I was trying to teII you! Whoa...
onIy the Ice Princess can use it.
it's not her fauIt her father won't Iet her Ieave her castIe.
boo-hoo.
no underwater readings.
no anything!
I'II rip your sockets to shreds!
caIm down, Sharkboy. Mr. EIectric's baiting you.
I can't... fight...
my instincts!
no, Sharkboy!
Watts... up?
you know - watts.
as in a measure of eIectricaI power.
the 60-watt bulb?
watts up?
what?
eIectric eeIs. That's what's up.
swim away, Sharkboy! Swim away!
can he survive down there?
he can hoId his breath, but not forever.
he'II drown if I don't go get him. -- I can't Iet you go.
you'II die too.
he's my best friend.
come on, Sharkboy.
come on, Sharkboy!
Sharkboy! Wake up, Sharkboy!
LavagirI!
LavagirI! LavagirI, pIease!
LavagirI...
what am I gonna do now?
what do you think you shouId do?
dream a better dream.
interesting. ExpIain.
I wanted aII my dreams to come true, but I onIy dreamt for myseIf.
I wanted to escape my reaI worId, when the worId needed my heIp to make it a better pIace.
seIfish dreams shouIdn't come true.
you're becoming a very good dreamer, Max.
a very good dreamer indeed.
what do you do when your dreams have been destroyed?
dream a better dream.
an unseIfish dream.
she knew this wouId happen if she saved you.
but I couIdn't stop her.
look!
lava.
we have to get her to that voIcano.
I'II go. I'm stronger and faster.
you'II burn up.
sure this wiII save her? -- It'II do more than save her.
I know who you are, LavagirI.
you are not fire or a simple flame.
you are greater than that.
something more important. and so necessary.
it is why you must Iive.
you are not destruction.
you are not eviI.
stand back.
you are... Iight.
who turned on the Iights?! Oh!
power, everywhere!
Whoa! How'd you get here so fast?
hoId off Mr. EIectric whiIe I deaI with Minus.
I'II need my fish army.
I'II unfreeze the ocean.
good Iuck.
I've become what you feared most...
minus.
how did you get in here?
I'm the Daydreamer, abIe to dream with my eyes open.
hate to burst your bubbIe, Dream Boy, but I read your book.
there's not one dream you've got that I haven't aIready seen.
so what do you say? Let's blow the roof off this place.
may the best dream win!
wait!
brainstorm!
Brain...freeze!
brain...
fart!
get ready for the uItimate power outage.
and who are you to beIieve that you can defeat me now?
no one speciaI.
just... king of the ocean.
shark frenzy.
you're afraid of me, aren't you?
I used to be.
someone smashed your dreams once, now aII you can do is smash everyone eIse's.
we can create a better dream than this. A better worId.
don't you see?
what do you say...
Linus?
Hurry!
No!
don't Iet me faII!
wouIdn't dream of it.
don't smash peopIe's dreams, Linus, because you'II smash your own as weII.
and you too wiII stop beIieving.
Max!
I am Iight.
thank you.
you were aIways that. It had nothing to do with me.
but now I know. So thank you.
OK, so she's a Iight. Big deaI.
the reaI news is... what I am.
annoying?
king of the ocean.
thanks for saving me.
everything wiII return to being the way it was.
you wiII be abIe to traveI to Earth and back again as you wish.
you can search for your father. You can ruIe Earth's Iava worId.
and what am I to do, now that you're aII buddy-buddy?
Mr. EIectric can go back to being the good eIectrician of the pIanet.
Oh, reaIIy?
pIugging in power cords?
keeping this Ioud, obnoxious worId a happy pIace?
you're dreaming!
I dreamt you up, and I can undream you.
you think you can just snap your eyes open and make me vanish? Not so easy.
I am the danger of dreaming.
for every person who dreams up the eIectric Iight buIb, there's the one who dreams up the atom bomb.
this is one dream you won't be waking up from.
I'm gonna put an end to this ridicuIous tangent at its source!
where did he go?
he's headed to Earth.
he's going to try and destroy you in your sIeep.
in my sIeep?
you mean I'm asIeep? AII this time I've been asIeep?
no. You're dreaming, Max.
with your eyes open.
make the dream reaI.
you can Iive out your dreams on Earth. Just Iike you made us reaI.
make it reaI.
BIink your eyes three times.
one...
wait. What happens when...?
two...
wiII I ever see you again?
three.
everyone foIIow me, I said! We've got to find sheIter!
Max, get up! There's a tornado heading our way!
it's not a tornado. It's much worse than that.
Linus, wake up!
look!
charge!
it's Mr. EIectric from PIanet DrooI! The one from my dreams!
you mean... this is reaI? Your dream is reaI?
some dreams are so powerfuI they become reaI.
I don't beIieve it.
it's right there in front of you! -- I can see that!
what I can't beIieve is you dreamed me as a big round bad guy! I'm not bad!
sorry. Kinda took on a life of its own.
Max is in BuiIding C. -- No, he's not. He's in BuiIding W.
that was the other schooI!
heIp!
find Max! TeII him I Iove him!
don't Ieave me! -- I thought you wanted me to Ieave.
no, I don't. You're my best friend.
I Iove you.
I Iove you too.
come back!
PIease, come back.
I'm not going anywhere.
neither am I.
OK, cIass. I'm just a teacher, and I'm here to inspire the answers from you.
and I think that's some pretty good inspiration outside.
so this is now a pop quiz. We need to defeat that guy. Any ideas?
wow, Linus. You get a pIus for being the first hand in the air.
I can take him.
Linus, watch out!
poop. -- Aaargh!
nice try.
sorry, Max. Your journaI.
it's ok. It was an accident.
pIenty more dreams where those came from.
OK, kids, who's next? Remember, there are no dumb ideas.
maybe we can freeze his circuits. -- That's the dumbest idea I ever heard.
we're in the middIe of Texas in August! Next idea? Anyone but Linus.
wait - that's a great idea! Thanks, Linus.
come here, Marissa.
is this yours?
how'd you find it?
so you've seen this?
Yes, but... onIy in a dream.
it can freeze anything. -- Even time.
what are you doing? You're not sending my daughter out there.
let her out.
eIectricaI storm headed your way!
do you know what to do? -- I beIieve so.
stand back.
Oh, who do we have here?
get ready for the mega-hurts!
get it? Hertz?
as in the unit of eIectricaI frequency?
you're just not paying attention in cIass, are you?
Whoa! Awesome!
he's unpIugged.
you made me a great teacher today. -- How did I do that?
a great teacher learns as much from his students as they do from him.
you have... awakened me.
thank you, Max.
Max.
your report, pIease.
the foIIowing story is true.
it might have started as a dream, but, as we saw yesterday, when we make our dreams a reaIity...reaIity becomes a dream.
Sharkboy lives his dream as king of the ocean.
where he cares for all its creatures.
he searches for his father's submarine where there is no light except in one place. where light shines almost as bright as the sun.
it's where Lavagirl lives her dream.
as queen of Earth's volcanoes that boil at the bottom of the sea.
a force of life for all living things.
Sharkboy and Lavagirl don't visit me anymore.
but I can visit them -- in my dreams.
so dream a better dream...
then work to make it real.
yes?

you're not a very good liar, Pete.
Seriously? - Yes. I... I really want to know.
9. 5. - [Chuckles]
excuse me.
[Woman] Charlie?
Charlie. Charlie! Oh, my God. Charlie.
somebody! Help! Charlie. Charlie. Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi. I just want to let you know what's going.
I hate you. [Chuckles]
I saw you on the news. I got your message. I know you want me to kill you.
excuse me. - Um, yeah. Sorry.
so all of these are from last week? - That's about half of them.
[Typing] - And then there are the verbal threats.
[Man] He's a dead man. I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
he's ruining this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
they sound worse in English. - Yeah.
we got this guy yesterday. Did you translate this?
no. But whoever did not a native speaker. - How Do you know that?
well, he translated here... [reading Spanish]
and that literally means " to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
as if he was being tortured. But that's not what it means here.
it's slang. It means he bribed him.
he didn't bite him.
[Chuckles] Good.
we need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
you picked a hell of a Day to start your field work.
button up your jacket. - Why? What going on?
[Man Over Radio] Dispatch, this is Charlie 9. Units on scene.
here comes the Secret Service. - I really Don't need them breathing Down my neck.
what do they know about investigating murder?
she can breathe down my neck.
but not him.
agents Breckinridge, Marin. Secret Service.
you guys bring lunch? - Not today.
the way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
as the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
bad guy shoots him first.
you think this is a street crime? - In my gut, yeah.
you know my problem with gut feelings?
once you have them, the only evidence you see...
is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
human nature. - There's no money left in his wallet...
and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
you have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense Danger...
to notice anything outside of the ordinary...
so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him... yeah, it raises questions.
not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario. - [Speaking Spanish]
anyone want anything to eat or drink?
uh, no, thanks, ma'am. I think we're fine. - Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for Dinner. I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
you sure? You've been on as long as me.
you gonna make me change my mind? - [Chuckles]
detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb. The slug didn't penetrate.
it's cedar, which is a soft wood. It gets brittle with age.
so what are you saying? - Bad guy used a silencer. That's why nobody heard it.
and that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet...
and stopped it from penetrating the wood...
which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
the shooter was standing right here.
one other thing, detective.
excuse me. Agent Merriweather's firearm... the safety's still on.
we assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
agent Marin, why Don't you explain to the Detectives why that is unlikely.
if he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you...
to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions...
to avoid accidental shootings.
our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
if he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
a protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
when we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
bottom line... Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon. I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
if this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
let's get a gurney up here!
it always amazes me how thorough you are.
well, we try to Do the best job we can.
hopefully you sleep better at night.
and I definitely do. - Garrison, Dipaola. We're good on the perimeter.
I'm 10-60. - Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can...
get something to eat.
Hi. - Hi.
you all right?
I missed you. I missed you so much.
just a second. - Okay.
this is outstanding. - There you go. And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
[Radio Beeps] - Garrison, diPaola. Where are you?
garrison, Dipaola, where are you? - Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi. So what the hell is going on, or...
aziz, what are you doing here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
he... He was murdered?
P. I.D. Thinks it might be connected to work.
director put us on alert.
I'm sorry. I know he was your friend.
was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
was he agitated or worried about anything?
he was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
did he tell you why? - He just said he had a couple of tough Days at work.
What'd he say at breakfast? - Some gossip. Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you...
but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
he told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
just gossip. It just... - Yeah.
probably not even true.
look, that's all we need for now.
you got the lead on Charlie's murder? - Screw you.
what? - Screw you.
you still got a problem with me? - Take your hands off of me.
Christ. It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me...
but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
if you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
otherwise, stay out of my way. - Fine. You're a piece of work.
you know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work. You have any idea what that might be?
no. - Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
Yeah, good. I'll send you a memo. - Do that.
Hey. Is everything okay? - Hey, Jill. Yeah.
you worker with him now? - Yeah.
keep your eyes open. You may learn a lot.
but don't listen to everything he's got to say.
especially about me. - Okay.
Pete.
there some problem between you two?
I thought you were friends. - We were.
so what happened? - It's personal.
let's go.
no. He can go to hell. I don't want to talk to him. - Just tell him it wasn't me.
it wasn't anybody. - I'm not saying it was.
I wasn't having an affair! - Cindy, I know you weren't.
what do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times? This is why I left him.
he's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
you still love him, Don't you?
Hey, Pete. Pete. - Hey, Tom.
you know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure. He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
okay. Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore...
offered to transfer the call to W. F.O. P. I.D.
he said you're the only person he'd talk to. - Thanks.
there he is! Publishers Clearing House, my man! You got something for me?
[Laughs] Did you fill yours out yet?
every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out. I never do.
long time, no see, Walter. What's up?
let's walk.
you got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
that agent who was killed outside his house on Monday? - Yeah.
maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
what was that something? - A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
not if you got somebody inside.
you saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
that's right.
there's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president? - That's right.
well, what's his name? - I don't know. I just know he exists.
well, how? Who... Who's giving you the information?
I want one million Dollars. - What are you smoking, Walter?
now be serious. - I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
they'll hunt me down. - We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be Dead in a Day. Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
you get me the money, and I will Disappear. - I got to be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we gottta agents in on an assassination attempt.
here. Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...
they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
listen, I want a list of everyone who's got " Q' clearance.
and where's the president right now?
press conference at his house. Twenty minutes.
this morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve...
to take on the infrastructure of terrorism...
wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
how reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
against who? - Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cantle.
sir. That's everyone with " Q' clearance.
[Ballentine] Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
now let me point out, this is very important...
polygraph everyone on that list...
and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this...
so let's fold that investigation in as well.
and we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing. - He's the best we've got?
Yeah. - Pete. He's kind of a protege of yours. What do you think?
he'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him. - Then he's the guy.
you can have anybody you want.
from I. D. from the field. You get cantle blanche.
not right now. - Oh, sorry.
I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie. - No, I'm gonna keep her.
she hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
[Man] I will blow you up. I come to bomb this country.
[Indistinct] Holy wars.
we have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda...
have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
you think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
probably. The threat alone interferes with the process.
we pulled 50 agents in from the field.
people who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
they'll integrate with both of your teams.
we're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
well, Do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat...
the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
as far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
is that clear? - Mr. President...
we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
what Do you think would happen to the power of the president...if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
it took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency...
and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
let's circle the wagons, okay? You all right? - Fine.
good, let's Do that. How do we proceed?
bill, you're the guy.
you're the last line of Defense.
you can protect him better than any of us can.
is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah. - [Coins Jingling]
this.
[Ballentine] And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
you can bank on it. Thank you very much. Good night.
good night. Thank you.
heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
this way, Mr. President. - Thank you, Bill.
classic is moving to bravo cars.
[Woman Over Radio] Copy that. Command to alpha cars. You are off the hook.
sir, could you put down that knife?
it's not what they wanted to hear. It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
he's an old C. I. Of Garrisons. Nine, 10 years.
garrison? - Mm-hmm.
what's wrong?
it's nothing.
are you sure? - Yes. It's okay.
how do I find Xavier? - Um, I Don't know where he lives.
he's a fanatic about not being followed. - You ever tried?
what? - Have you ever tried?
he wants a million bucks from us, Dave. I'm sure he'll contact us.
you better be right.
you get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
could be any one of them. It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
what percentage of your people have had a polygraph? - A little over half.
"over half"? The president's life is at stake.
heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5: 00 p. m. This afternoon...
or don't show up for work tomorrow.
were you born in Morocco? - No.
do you live in Bethesda? - No.

[Teddy] You guys all decent? - Afraid so.
your informant's on the phone.

and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
Yeah, right. - Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now. Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.

you might want to figure that one out, Pete.
[Carl] Pete!
presidential helicopter just went Down.
[Woman Over TV] This is a news center special report.
the presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
[Man Over TV] Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
whether or not the president was on board has not...
marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
it happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
the chopper went down in some densely wooded...
[Man Over TV] We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
actually, we can now confirm...
that neither the president or the first lady...
were on board at the time of the crash.
the president and first lady are safe.
if you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
where earlier today, Marine One... - [Speaking Foreign Language]
went down shortly after take off.
two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail...
just before that helicopter went down.
that is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
our friend was insufficiently motivated. - That the chopper was shot down...
probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
now, we want to make clear, again...
that the president and first lady are safe. - [Foreign Language]
[Woman] If you reauctioning us, these are live pictures from the scene...
just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft...
and they were killed in the crash.
this crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
you failed. - [Man] I did exactly what I promised.
he wasn't on board.
that is the only thing that matters. That is the only thing I give a shit a...
do you understand?
now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
[Man] Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft...
including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
but that comes from witnesses.
has not been confirmed by investigators. - [Knocking]
again, these pictures coming to us about... - [Shuts TV Off]
well, it sure Doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
you're being investigated for treason.
what are you talk... - Step back.
excuse me? - Step back.
Hey, Jill. - Pete.
Matt. - Pete.
sorry for the intrusion, sir.
if I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving regards life...without a little more evidence
how long you been working for the Barranquilla Cantle?
what are you talking about?
[Door Opens] - Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F. B.I.
what were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
I was having a cup of coffee. - Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop. Is there a problem with that?
Tom Dipaola said he called you four times. You never returned any of his messages.
and that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
they moved the flight up two hours. I was in the coffee shop.
it was noisy. I couldn't hear my cell phone.
now, wh-wh-what is this? What the hell are you Doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cantle.
[Breckinridge] You screwed up, Pete. You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cantle.
and I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
why would I want to kill the president? What motive do I have?
to be honest with you, I don't care. I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
I've gotten up at 4: 00 a. m. Every god damn morning. - Is that what this is about?
you're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no. Don't confuse your own ambition with mine. Okay, Dave?
come on, Pete. Think about it. People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
and in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor...on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
but they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit...in charge of P. P.D. Do they?
even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
is that your professional or personal opinion?
I think this whole thing is getting personal. - We got you nailed to the wall.
I didn't have an affair with Cindy. - Has nothing to do with Cindy.
you can't accept that. - We are not talking about that!
we're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
you can't look at me without thinking about it!
Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip. - I got a grip.
you think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
the polygraph. Las Palmas Coffee Shop. You had unfettered access to Marine One.
it was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
it was hit by a missile because the flares...
and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
there was a hundred other people who had access to it.
explain to me about the bank account.
the what? The... - Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
tell me that's not your signature. - Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
you initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department...
so that when the assassination actually took place...
you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed! Goddamn it! Just think about it.
you take me in, that's the end. That guy is out there somewhere! - [Whistles]
the Director just rolled up outside.
you better start thinking about cooperating.
he's in the car.
what are you doing, Pete? - Getting a glass of water.
director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
that's very impressive. - It's embarrassing for us, sir.
want a beer? - Look, Pete, we're really...
garrison back Door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
where is he?
[gasping] - Sorry.
this is Breckinridge. Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
cordon off the area and get back to me.
he got my radio. - He got my gun too.
he got your gun? And your radio?
what the hell are you looking her for?
she's been here two days. How long have you been here?
[Man] Where to, mister?
just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
for most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
but the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
so, how Do we find him? To begin with, know this.
he is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
you've never trained for this. You are chasing your worst nightmare.
he knows how you think. He knows what you know. And he knows how you operate.
and he will use that against you.
he also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you...to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
so I want you to take a second and visualize that.
because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
can I have one of these here? - Yeah, sure. Take it.
[Phone Ringing] - Yeah?
[Woman Over Radio] Fullback, Backstop. Do you have an arrival?
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, Fullback. We have arrival.
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, go.
[Dipaola] Cincinnati wrapping up. We're alpha for Departure.
I miss the good old Days. Do you know what I mean? I really literally Do.
[Man] He taps him on the back and the bear says...
you didn't come here to hunt, did you?
get it? The bear.
[Man #2] That's not funny, man. - [Laughing]
[Man #2] That joke ain't funny at all. - [Phone ringing]
[Man Over Radio] Fullback. We're moving. - Roger that. We're set up.
see you later, okay? Be right back.
thank you.
Welke, Dipaola. Cincinnati's coming to you. - Copy that.
ma'am.
what are you doing here? I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
whatever you hear about me in the next few Days, I want you to know I was framed.
I had to tell you to your face. - No, you Don't. No, you Don't.
we're gonna get out of this. - How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
this is out of control. You've got to turn yourself in. - No, no.
Yes, you do. I'll go to John. I'll tell him everything. - I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin. They will kill you.
you can cover my back. - How?
the Director has got a Daily password for the agents. Find out what it is.
I'm checking through stuff. - Hey, guys. Garrison just used his cell phone.
he called Chez Doucette.
you turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
ballsy. Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
she came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
this is your post? - Yeah, it is.
naturally, the first lady Doesn't want to believe...
the man protecting her for the last eight months...
is trying to assassinate her husband.
that's why Pete came here.
he's looking for an ally.
and the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
great. The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
start looking for cars that were taken within walking Distance...
of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
Taurus's, Camrys and Explorers. - How Do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the d. C. Area.
Pete knows that. He's gonna want to blend in.
and the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
if he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
he knows we would know that. He would Do it.
he could connect to someone else. - How?
well, he'd need that persons password.
but as a supervisor, it would be hard to get access to others' passwords.
why would he Do that? Why would he even risk it? - Because he feels trapped.
we have his credit cards, his cell phone.
he has no other place to hide.
can I help you? - Oh, yes, ma'am.
my name is Lawson Smith. I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form. - Sweepstakes?
Yes, ma'am. I'm with Publishers Clearing House. - He win?
well, he's a finalist. - Million Dollars.
and you must be his mother. - Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller. I'm remarried.
would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help you get in touch with Walter.
bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
well, if you Do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
thank you, ma'am.
have a good Day.
[Computerized Voice] Leave a message. - [Machine Beeps]
Walter, it's Mom.
a guy just come by the house looking for you. He's a cop.
on a gut level it Doesn't make sense.
the only thing this guy cares about in life is his job. - And you know this, why?
because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
listen to me. Pete Garrison was my best friend...
for 10 years... till he slept with my wife.
so trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
yeah? - Somebody who's not Tom Dipaola...
just signed in to our Databases using DiPaola's password.
pulled up an address in AnDrewsboro, Maryland. - I Don't believe this.
get the rest of the team ready. Let's go.
Walter! - ## [Woman Singing Over Radio]

Pete, Don't move!
Pete!
the traitor is still out there, Dave. - Fine.

what happened? - I took him Down with a shot to the vest.
what's the least contained environment...
the president's going to be in over the next few Days? - G8 Summit. Toronto.
it's a nightmare for us.
canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
the border's not gonna stop him. It's 3, 500 miles long and barely patrolled.
you really think it's him, Don't you?
Pete, you scared me! - Nancy, I'm sorry. I can explain everything.
what is going on? What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents...
so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
is that why there's a car watching the house?
the maroon Cadillac.
who are they? - I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
not the Secret Service. The police. Tell them about the Cadillac.
okay. - Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours. Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
she didn't go nowhere. She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
what do you want me to do?
come on. Yes, yes, by herself.
okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no.
what do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night. She's not gonna be a problem.
no, no. No.
Yes, yes, by herself.
everything's gonna be okay.

Hi, Jill. - Pete?
Yeah. Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
he's a foreign operative. He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
he's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
okay, Pete. We're on it. But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
what are you talking about? - There's no body.
there's blood all over the goddamn place. - There's blood all over...
but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
listen. This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
they're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete. Pete?
[Knocking] - Sarah?
listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
[Cell Phone Ringing] - Oh!
California. My sister. I'll call her back.
well, this is the speech I'm gonna give. I'm... I'm reasonably happy.
maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
sure. Then I'll see you tomorrow. I'll be up after the meeting.
okay. Thanks.
[Computerized Voice] One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
rip this place apart. Find me something now. - [Cell Phone Ringing]
this is Agent Breckinridge. - [Sarah] Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
[Sarah] Come in.
excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
could I offer you a drink? - No, thank you, ma'am.
you know, most women don't like whiskey...
but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
please have a seat. And.. that's for you.
you know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him...
but I Do know why he failed the lie Detector test.
and I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
hello. U. S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the Duty officer over at the lab.
that'll be that Direction on the eighth floor. - Thank you.
sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
okay. - Thank you very much.
see you in about 12 minutes.
[Man Over Radio] Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
but if you want to grab a coffee... - Marin.
Hey, Jill. This is Pete. - A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
did you find any prints at the apartment? - No. Nothing.
I did. You gotta help me out. If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take...to check them against the F. B.I. And C. I.A. Databases?
five minutes after I receive them.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them. Bye.
I've got a print in here. Could somebody run it for me, please?
Yeah, I got it. - Thank you.
in my experience a guilty man Doesn't break into a police station...
and check fingerprints for a few hours.
what do you think?
my phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account. The other things I can explain.
I know about the affair. - It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know. The first lady.
she told me everything. I know you're being framed.
she showed me the blackmail photos.
so where does that leave us?
we need to find this guy. - Come here.
Yeah.
you really are an idiot, you know that?
you honestly thought that this would be uncovered? - Dave, I love her.
well, that's practical.
the prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K. G. B...
now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy...
responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
this is a classified conversation. We'll be out of here in two minutes.
Yeah. Whatever. - Thank you.
these people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
all right, let's get going.
we've still gotta find the mole.
we polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
yours was the only one that showed Deception.
we need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
[Montrose] You know I never guaranteed you success.
security's tighter than it's ever been.
routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
all right. Fair enough.
that's not gonna work anymore.
you did make a Deal. - Yeah.
twenty years ago with the K. G.,B. which doesn't even exist anymore.
do you want out, William?
then give me... the president.
just like you agreed.
no.
I don't care.
expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
here you go. - Have a pint.
Oh. Thank you.
William...
if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
we are going to kill her.
and we're gonna kill her.
and then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K. G.B. 's gone.
but we're still here.
William, it's all right.
you do have a way out.
but only one.
when he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route...
to the "B" motorcade under the plaza...
and you take the radios out.
then that's it. And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
you can keep those.
I got Doubles.
Jill, it's David. I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
we're on our way to city hall. - Got it.
[Man Over Radio] Command Post from Apache follow-up.
arrive Martinez location 1740 hours. Copy.

all posts, all posts, be advised. We have an arrival.
only essential traffic at this time.
everybody ready? - Yes, sir.
let's Do this.
[Cell Phone Ringing] - Yeah, tell me what you got.
Montrose didn't take the polygraph. - You're 100% sure?
positive. Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
neither one of them. - Montrose Dirt take the polygraph.
now let there be no mistake. In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
america must be strong.
but previous administrations...
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
he was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
the logs are Montrose's. - Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill. It's Pete.
get a hold of the first lady and tell her... only her... that it's Montrose.
got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete. The first lady? What were you thinking?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
[Man Over Radio] Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
[Woman Over Radio] Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through...
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus! I got Garrison through the three.
[Ballentine] This resolution cannot function alone. It is designed...
it's Garrison and Breck.
holster your weapons. Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge. I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
subject in my sight. Do I take the shot?
we must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
we must embrace the ideal of an African economic union. - Need assistance, over.
he's a Do Not Admit. - We have orders.
I am countermanding your orders! - You don't control this site.
Montrose does. - Don't call him!
Montrose is the mole! - Montrose?
what's the procedure for that?
[Man Over Radio] No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
ma'am.
something's wrong. My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio. I don't have any radio.
I'm not hearing any chatter. - I've got silence on all channels.
it's going Down! - Agent Garrison called on my line.
he wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
[Ballentine] But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests...
without causing resentment.
[Elevator Bell Dings] - Get your hands in the air!
put that Down! - [Breckinridge] Pete Garrison is not the mole!
[Woman] You are a Do Not Admit! - But at the same time...
Mr. President. - [Breckinridge] Listen to me!
do not let him move the president!
this way, Mr. President.
do not let Montrose move the president! - Montrose, he's getting away!
crystal. Crystal is the password.
we need your help. Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
it's all right.
Freeze! - Password is Crystal. Where'd Montrose take the president?
motorcade "B." - Stay with me, ma'am.
this way.
it's just this way, ma'am. - Tom, where are we going?
[Woman] We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
that's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
what is going on with these goddamn radios?
go in twos.
what's next, boss? What's the next move?
what's next? - Bill?
hold the corridor. Push them back.
crystal!
[Hassid] Pete, we're cut off from the "B'"motorcade.
you okay?
I think so. - Turn off your locator.
what?
your locator, turn it off. That's how they know where we are. They're tracking us.
how do you... How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill. Oh, God.
Montrose was...
[Montrose] Pete. Pete.
my family. My family. Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
we're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
shooter's at 11: 00. I'll go high. You go low. You ready?
Yeah. - Go.
get the president upstairs. We'll cover you from here.
this way, ma'am. As quick as you can.
[Groans] Yes. Garrison.
need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
coming to you, Pete. Go. Go! Go, go!
southwest stairs. Let's go get them!
all right, we're gonna get you out of here.
give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
president's hard car! Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him. Mr. President, you're with me.
[Breckinridge] The president is away!
go, go, go, go!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god.
[Breckinridge] Secure the first lady! - We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
listen, Pete, um...
you take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job. I was proud to work with you.
Thanks. - Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys. Good careers.
take care.
do well, guys. See you soon.
Hey, Pete. - Yeah?
this could be trouble. - [All Laughing]
I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this? - [All Laughing]
Thanks, guys.
Bye-bye. All the best. - [Jill] Hey, Pete!
you gonna leave without saying good-bye?
well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
so, how about a little retirement Dinner tonight?
I can't. I got a date.
something you want to tell me? - With my wife.
that's great.
Pete. - See you around campus, Jill.
thanks for everything. - Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
it's gonna miss you too.
take care.
stop it! Justin!
guys! Stop it!
Justin, get off!
Where's my daughter?!
excuse me. I'm so sorry.
Viola! Stop! This isn't ladylike.
there is no room for violence here!
this is a lovely children's carnival, goddamn it!
both of you, out! Now!
where were you at today? You just disappeared.
ran into my psycho ex. Had to bolt.
Oh, my God! Is that a?
what? Yeah.
I hope you don't mind. I kind of borrowed one of your...
Yeah. And you're right, by the way. These things actually work.
Oh, my God, you're bleeding. Are you OK?
I mean, suck it up! Be a man! Rub some dirt in it!
OK, I'll rub some dirt on it.
so, what happened?
I got into it with your sister's ex.
wait. Really? Why?
he saw me and her kind of making out at the kissing booth.
wait. You kissed her?
Yeah, man, I'm... I hope that's OK.
it was for charity.
Oh, no, I mean, dude, I mean, if you want to kiss her, you go right ahead and you kiss her!
I mean, knock yourself out.
I mean, you just... you take her and then kiss her and kiss the crap out of her!
OK.
so do you like her?
I don't know. Can we not talk about this?
she's your sister. It's kind of weird.
no. Right. Right.
just... You know, I was just thinking that, if you liked her then maybe you should ask her out.
and just, I don't know, forget about Olivia?
well, I mean, speaking as a completely objective third-party outsider with absolutely no personal interest in the matter,
I am not sure that you and Olivia really mesh well together. You know? I mean...
but you and Viola...
I mean...be magic.
I don't know.
what does your heart tell you?
I mean, which one would you rather see naked?!
why do you? Why? Why do you always do that?
why do you always talk about girls in such graphic terms?
you know what? You... you have issues.
you're a really sensitive guy, aren't you?
what? No. No, it's just...
I don't know. I just think that relationships should be more than just the physical stuff.
don't get me wrong, that stuff's important, but when I'm with someone,
I want to be able to talk about other stuff.
like, I don't know, serious stuff.
stuff I can't talk about, you know, with anyone else.
Yeah, like...
what kind of stuff?
I don't know, just stuff.
like, whatever stuff there is.
like... this kind of stuff?
Yeah.
but what I just told you is for your ears only.
if you tell anyone, I'll kick your ass.
Yeah. No.
I got your back, man.
it's cool.
how's your sister?
good. Why?
I don't know.
I kind of was thinking I might ask if she wanted to grab dinner at Cesario's tonight.
you were? Really? I'd love to.
what?
I'd love to give her your phone number.
Hastings!
Yeah, coach?
you're first string for the Cornwall game.
Really? - No.
I was joking, you idiot.
dude, that's awesome.
dude.
so, you want me to spot you? - No.
isn't he cute? - Duke? Yeah.
no. Sebastian. He's so cool.
but he said I'm not his type.
impossible. You're everyone's type. - Not his.
I could tell you what us mere mortals would do in this situation.
what? - Make him jealous.
so, what do you do? You just pretend to like somebody else?
and then use him shamelessly.
Wow.
so, you should call Viola up.
Yeah. I think I will.
Hey, Duke.
Sebastian. - Olivia.
Olivia.
What're you bench-pressing these days?
225. Very impressive.
Thanks.
so, Duke, about that call that you were gonna make.
you gonna make that? - Yeah. Thank you.
so how many reps can you do with that 225?
225 is more than twice what I weigh.
how many reps could you do with me?
Hello?
Hi, it's Viola.
Sebastian told me to call you.
I'd love to go to dinner. - Yeah. What?
can I call you back?
because I gotta change my feet.
so, do you have any plans tonight?
my bad.
what about the thing that we talked about that you were going to do later?
what thing? I'm thingless.
great! Then it's a date. Cesario's, 8: 00.
I'll see you there. - OK.
Bye, Sebastian. - Later.
Yeah!
you did it.
I'm goin' out with Olivia.
what the hell?! I thought you liked Viola now!
dude, come on. You're a guy.
what would you do if the hottest girl in the school came up to you and asked you on a date?
I'll be right back.
Olivia? Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?
whatever for?
it's about your date with Duke.
I know! I am so glad I listened to you. You're right. He's awesome.
and he looked so good in those shorts.
he's not a piece of meat, Olivia.
he's a man. A man with feelings.
and I'm a woman with feelings.
and my feelings seem to match his.
you know what?
speaking as a completely objective third-party observer with absolutely no personal interest in the matter,
I'm not so sure that you and Duke are a good idea after all.
well, thank you for your concern.
and if you're so worried, maybe you should come to Cesario's tonight, just to keep an eye on me. We could double.
I bet Eunice is available.
I'm so there, it's insane.
so do you like... cheese?
Hey, you two, what's going on? - You're here with Eunice.
mind if we join?
no. Sit down. - No, no, no.
lady pterodactyl.
waiter!
help.
so...
I was just telling Duke how great it is to meet a real man at this school.
you were?
well, I was just about to.
isn't it great to have a real man around, Eunice?
Oh, yes.
a real man is difficult to find.
so difficult.
Sebastian's with Eunice. She must be hotter than I thought.
how come when I wanted to ask out Eunice everyone made fun?
Sebastian likes her, suddenly she's cool?
screw you guys. I hate high school.
Eunice! Hands!
you know what? This has been real fun, but I have to go...
shave.
OK.
well, this has been lovely. Let's do it again sometime.
what? - Soon. Bye.
so...
do you like cheese?
more than almost any other animal byproduct.
Yeah, check please.
hey Monique, it's Sebastian.
I don't know if Viola told you I'm in London, but I'm heading home a day early.
listen, I've been thinking, and we really need to talk.
ladies...
ladies...
ladies.
welcome.
my name is Cheryl Lancaster, president of the Stratford Junior League and coordinator of this year's debutante season.
Oh, please.
thank you. Today we're gonna go over the guidelines for a graceful, ladylike entree into society.
son of a...
hello.
hello there.
Hi. - Make sure she's in the back for the group photo.
thank you for joining us, Viola.
now, who's ready to come out?
kill me.
Viola? Darling.
excuse me.
ladies.
Hi. - Hey.
Hey! You're the one that saved me in the kissing booth that one time?
Hi. - Hi.
Oh, what a small world. I'm Viola.
Olivia.
nice to meet you. - You too.
so...
I know it's none of my business, but you went out with that Duke Orsino guy, right?
Yeah. Once.
did you kiss him? - No, why?
Oh, no. It's nothing, but...
just try to postpone it as long as possible.
he has this salivary gland condition.
Yeah. He doesn't really like to talk about it, but it felt like I was drowning.
Really?
Oh, my God. - I know. It was repulsive.
but, hey, every happiness to you both.
no, actually, I don't really like Duke.
I have this huge thing for his roommate, Sebastian.
and I was just trying to make Sebastian jealous.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, I know it's really wrong to use a person this way, and I feel really terrible about it.
but I really, really like Sebastian.
he's so handsome, not the goonish handsome you see in a lot of guys.
he's a delicate, like, even refined handsome, you know?
Oh, and when he smiles, I just can't stop looking at him.
he's just so wonderful.
you know, Olivia...
it's Olivia, right? - Yeah.
I'm gonna give you just a little advice.
OK. - Enough is enough!
you are weaving a really tangled web.
like really, really tangled.
and, honey... you got to stop!
OK? So you just gotta tell everybody the truth.
be very, very honest.
just let the chips fall where they may.
you're right. - I know.
the next time I see Sebastian I'll march right up to him.
you march! - And I'll tell him how I feel.
you tell him.
then I'll kiss him so passionately, that even the people he hates will feel pleasure.
Hello, Viola.
Oh, this is not good.
and hello to you, you little homewrecker.
who are you? - I am Sebastian's girlfriend.
ex-girlfriend.
OK, everybody's got to stop saying that.
you were the one he dumped in the pizza parlor the other day.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He did not dump me.
we're just going through a little bit of a rough patch.
I heard he dumped you. He dumped you big.
are you crazy?! Are you OK?
get out!
you are messing with the wrong man!
get off me! Get off of me!
get off of her! - Let go of me!
ladies! Ladies, stop!
please!
when debutantes disagree they say it with their eyes.
well, Hastings.
why is it that I always find you in the middle of a tussle?
bad timing?
I am convinced he's hiding something.
nonsense, Malcolm. He may be a little lost and confused, but deep down he's an all-American, red-blooded male.
just like yourself. - Mom, I will pick out my own dress. And no, I will not wear heels.
because heels are a male invention designed to make a woman's butt look smaller.
and to make it harder for them to run away.
Malcolm, have you ever tried to run away in high heels?
no, sir, I wouldn't- Not that easy. Not that easy.
don't forget your guitar, Mr. Hastings.
just do it. Just close your eyes and kiss him.
Sebastian.
wake up. I've been waiting for you to open your eyes so I can tell you I think I'm ready.
I'm ready to free-fall into the unknown.
I'll see you at the game tomorrow.
I think I'm gonna like this school.
Monique, it's Sebastian.
I don't know if Viola told you I'm in London, but I'm heading home a day early.
listen, I've been thinking. We really need to talk.
London?
Hey, brother. Dinklage was looking for you, man.
dude. Hello!
you know, it's... crazy how wrong you can be about a person.
it's crazy.
you think they're one thing, and then they turn out to be the exact opposite.
what are you talking about? - You're gonna sit there and act like you don't know what I'm talking about?
and act like you don't know what I'm talking about?
OK.
all right. OK.
I wanted to tell you, Duke, but you have to know...
I love soccer more than anything else in the world, and I had a point to prove.
What?! So you're telling me that you used me to help you with soccer, and then you turn around and stab me in the back?
wait, what? Now I really don't know what you're talking about.
save it, man. I saw you with her.
with who?! - Who?! Olivia, that's who!
you kissed when you got out the cab! - What cab?!
we were supposed to be friends! - We are!
you don't know the meaning! - Olivia never liked you, OK?!
she was just using you to make me jealous.
but Viola, she's crazy about you, since the first moment that you kissed her.
I bet that's part of your plan. Distract me so you can move in to Olivia.
that is not what happened! - You and your sister have a good life!
the Hastings twins couldn't be more opposite.
twins? - Sebastian?
Sebastian?
Sebastian, open up!
it's Monique! You have got a lot of explaining to do, followed by a very long night of groveling!
he's not here!
take his stupid cell phone. Justine calls every ten seconds.
this isn't Sebastian's phone.
God! Sebastian!
Sebastian! - Can I help you?
Hello? - Viola. Hey, baby.
it's Justin. You know, the big game is tomorrow and...
Viola.
allow me to introduce myself.
nice night... 2008.
Hey, Eunice.
sorry about running out on our date.
that's OK. My intensity scares some people.
Yeah.
is something wrong?
got thrown out of my room.
you mean... you need a place to sleep?
I really do. The Cornwall game is tomorrow.
I've never had a roommate before.
Wow. Vi, you set up all my stuff.
Thanks.
you're absolutely certain about this? - Yes, sir, we are.
dude, what are you doing?! - Sebastian, the game's about to start!
get out of bed and get over to the soccer field, man!
the soccer game?
that's what that girl was talking about.
Sebastian! You're next. Hurry up.
come over here, and I'll do you.
OK, ladies, listen up.
Where's Hastings?
Euni...
Eunice! Why didn't you wake me?!
you looked so serene.
I made breakfast, darling.
pardon me. Pardon me.
what is the big emergency? I canceled my squash game for this.
I don't know. All that Principal Gold said was that we were needed at Sebastian's soccer game.
hasn't Viola said anything to you the past couple of weeks?
how should I know?
she's been living with you.
hasn't she?
excuse me. - This is so exciting, guys.
welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
the biggest rivalry in our district is afoot.
Illyria versus Cornwall.
it's gonna be something else, and the atmosphere is crazy!
afternoon, gentlemen.
handshake, please.
all right, your call.
heads.
heads it is.
we'll stay as we are.
good game, gentlemen.
how's your jaw?
all right, let's get it on!
way to go, boys.
listen to me. We can do this. Today is the day - Cornwall beats Illyria. - Yeah!
I ain't got much to say to you.
who's gonna bring blood and pain?! - Black and red!
this ain't no game. This is a war! - Yeah!
who's gonna bring that blood and pain?!
one, two, three! Cornwall!
all right, boys, here we go!
Hastings! Pass it off! Pass it off! Hastings!
what in the hell is going on?!
nice move, moron.
what?
this can't be happening.
Sebastian?
get the ball! Get the ball!
get up, get back in there! Get the ball!
Oh, my God, this is my game!
what the hell am I doing? This isn't fun.
you look like Bambi on ice, boy!
Sebastian!
Sebastian!
can I get a timeout, please? A pause? One brief halftime?
stopping the clock. That's it. Stop the clock.
what the?
I don't know the technical lingo.
armadillos. Fighting Armadillos, please.
I need... Gather around.
I played soccer as a young man. Was it chess?
is there a problem, principal? - Yes. Unfortunately there is.
but I think it's only right that Sebastian Hastings tell you himself.
Sebastian? Son? Or...
do you have anything you'd like to say?
I'm sorry I'm not a very good soccer player.
I see.
well then, please know that what I say,
I say with a heavy heart.
ladies and gentlemen, esteemed alumni, friends and family of Sebastian Hastings,
I am grievously sad to inform you that Sebastian Hastings is... a girl
sorry, it's for your own good. You'll thank me for it someday.
Oh, OK. Certainly. Yes.
excuse me. I'm not a girl.
Hello! Yes.
in fact, yes, he is. He's a big girl.
he's actually specifically his own sister, Viola, who's been impersonating him for reasons which will become very clear after extensive psychoanalysis.
folks.
I'm a boy. I promise.
prove it. - OK.
God! I saw it.
nice work, Paul. Wow.
that's my boy.
Kevin, close your eyes.
soccer is the world's favorite sport.
thank you. Thank you.
nothing to see here. No offense.
folks, please, hang on for one second.
just talk amongst yourselves for a second.
Malcolm!
can you shed some light on the current situation?
not any more than has already been shed, sir.
OK, lads, listen up now.
now that we've established this boy is a boy...
is it possible we can get back to our game?
Yes. Enjoy. That was a skit we...
OK. Yes.
let's get to it, guys. Come on.
I know, let's play. - Waste of time.
baby. Baby, baby, baby. I have missed you so much.
Oh, my God, we are both so dead.
we're over, Monique. Done.
God! Not again!
good work, Hastings.
bench.
good one!
halftime, gentlemen.
Sebastian!
VI? - Yes.
why do you look like me?!
I pretended to be you the last two weeks to prove I could play in the boys soccer team.
Yes. - OK. OK, cool.
no, wait! What?! - I don't have time to explain!
why are you wearing my uniform?
I came to find the girl that kissed me last night.
who kissed you? What girl? - Check it out. That one.
Olivia?
she was all over me. She kissed me and recited my own lyrics.
vi, this may be the girl of my dreams.
that's the kiss that Duke saw.
wait, are those real?
Yeah. I'm growing sideburns.
No! Please stay hidden until the end of the game.
and give me my uniform back right now!
we start the second half.
illyria, zero, Cornwall, zero. Nothing but a couple of goose eggs.
coach, I'm ready to play. - Is that what you call it?
I've seen little girls in tutus kick the ball better.
I've changed.
come on, coach, give me one more chance.
all right. Go.
kick. Kill!
Yeah! Now that's Viola!
you couldn't score on me in the first half.
you ain't going to score on me this half, baby! I'm ninja! Ninja goalie!
come on, guys!
Duke! Duke! I'm open!
give me the ball! Duke! Hey, over here!
I'm open!
Duke! Get back! Get back!
No!
Yes, way to go, baby!
Cornwall's right back in it with a goal.
what's the matter?! Sebastian's open! - Rather lose the goal?!
shut up, man.
Duke, I know you're mad at me.
don't talk to me. Get out of my face!
nothing is going on with me and Olivia! When the game is over I'll explain!
for right now, you don't have to like me, but I'm your teammate, OK?!
I want to beat these guys! I have to beat these guys!
if we're not disturbing you, we have a soccer game to finish.
get back in the net, man.
or you'll hit my fist with your face again?
do you want to see me do it? Let's go!
Duke, come on. Stop it.
come on! - Duke, stop it.
Sebastian!
Duke! Stop it!
come on!
OK!
stop it! Oh, my God!
if you want to roughhouse, take it at least 500 yards - away from the stadium grounds. - Break it up! Break it up!
OK, tough guys.
you want to box? You get out of my stadium.
otherwise, get on with the game.
come on, now, Armadillos of Illyria.
that goes for the rest of you!
now get on and play some real football!
like a bunch of girls. - OK.
the rest of you, let's play some real football like a bunch of girls.
all right? - You suck!
it's not football, it's soccer. That's what we call it in the States.
Sebastian! Are you OK? - No, Olivia, Not now.
try to tell me again there's nothing going on.
there is nothing going on!
what about last night? - I didn't lie to you, Duke.
I did, but not about this.
here's the truth.
I love you.
I beg your pardon?
what? All right... What're you? That's just a little weird.
OK, you know what? I can't do this anymore.
everybody, I have something to tell you.
I'm not Sebastian.
I'm Viola.
wait. You're not Viola.
Yes, I am. - No, I know Viola.
I... I kissed Viola. - You kissed me.
what are you talking about? I didn't kiss you.
the girls team at Cornwall got cut.
the guys wouldn't let me go out for their team.
so I've been pretending to be my brother while he was in London for the past two weeks...
so I could make the team and beat Cornwall.
but my brother came home early.
and that's who you saw kissing Olivia and that's who played the first half.
because you wear a wig doesn't prove you're a girl.
OK, then.
merciful Jesus.
Yeah!
Viola?! - Is it just me or this soccer game have more nudity than most?
all right, so everybody understand?
Yeah. I get it. - OK.
wait a minute. If I kissed your brother, where is he?
probably halfway to China. He showed his willis and doodleberries...
present. - Hi.
what the?
OK, this is freaking me out.
ladies and gentlemen, I hate to say "I told you so," but I just...
see, Duke? I didn't betray you.
I'm sorry.
this isn't how I wanted it to happen, and I didn't want to hurt you.
but I just wanted to prove that I was good enough.
all I'm asking for is a chance.
Duke?
it's just like what coach says before every game:
be not afraid of greatness.
some are born great. Some achieve greatness.
I think the best chance for us to be great here today is to have you play.
Yeah! - All right!
Yeah! Yeah! No!
no playing!
you have to forfeit.
there's no girls in this league. Look in the manual.
what manual?
listen, pal. You're in Illyria.
we don't discriminate based on gender.
all right.
that's gonna bruise.
fine. You really think you can beat us with a girl on your team?
this should be fun.
go.
I get to say the last word, not you. Go.
OK, team...
let's go kick! Kill! - Yeah!
come on! Come on!
well, folks, this is a real nail-biter.
it's a tie score at the bottom of the second half.
come on, come on! Open up!
what?
foul? That's not a foul! He got all ball!
and the penalty kick will decide the game.
where you gonna kick it? Right here? I know you're gonna kick it there.
am I in your head? Am I in your head?
you see the goal? It's getting smaller and I'm getting bigger.
come on.
I love you.
concentrate. Don't kick like a girl.
guys are better. It's not gonna happen.
you're a loser! This is my house!
you're pathetic! I'm in your head.
Yeah!
that's my girl! - Mine too!
it's not fair! It's not fair!
that was a lucky shot!
I never wanna see you again! You suck!
you did it, Vi! - You were so awesome!
I am so proud of you. - It's over.
you scored the game-winning goal. Say something.
mom? Dad?
that was really something. - Thanks, Dad.
you did all this to play soccer? - I told you, it's important to me.
if Viola was here pretending to be you, - where were you? - Oh, he was...
I was in London playing my music.
London? - It was important to me.
you should call before you- How did you?
mom, Dad... Hey!
why don't we go to dinner? As a family?
maybe tomorrow? - I suppose I could fit that in.
would you like to have my cell phone number?
let me give you my e-mail. - All right.
Yay!
good job. - Thank you.
Oh, wait! There is somebody I want you to officially meet.
Sebastian Hastings, Olivia Lennox.
it's very nice to meet you. - You too.
so I heard you like my lyrics.
Eunice? - Toby?
I have something to say.
I think you are...amazing.
and I'm not ashamed of it.
I know tricks.
Oh, Eunice.
Hey, roomie.
this is for you.
the Stratford Junior League invites you to the 38th Annual Debutante Ball.
he still could show, you know. - You didn't see his face.
I found the perfect dress.
Thanks, Mom, but I don't think I'm gonna get a chance to wear it.
nonsense.
you don't need a man to wear a beautiful dress.
but it doesn't hurt.
viola Hastings, it would be my honor to escort you tonight.
Thanks, Paul. That's really sweet.
Caterpillars! My precious caterpillars.
in 20 minutes you'll all be beautiful butterflies.
Caterpillars! - Butterflies!
you look beautiful. I just... I gotta get some air.
I didn't think you'd show up.
it really means a lot to me that you're here.
say something. - I gotta turn the sprinklers on.
sorry.
Hi. - Hi.
so, what brings you here?
well, a few days ago,
I kissed this girl at a kissing booth.
and now I just can't seem to stop thinking about it.
neither can she.
Plus, I miss my roommate.
I really liked him.
well he's right in here.
listen, I know I should've told you who I was, but I was afraid.
sorry. - Well, you know, maybe if I'd have known you were a girl, we wouldn't have talked like we did and got to know each other the same way.
and that would have been a shame.
just so you know, everything you told me when I was a guy just...
made me like you so much more as a girl.
OK, but just from here on in, everything would just be a lot easier if you stayed a girl.
I promise.
Monique Valentine, escorted by Justin Drayton.
Justin, you're the man!
Olivia Lennox, escorted by Sebastian Hastings.
viola Hastings, escorted by Paul Antonio.
viola Hastings.
this is typical. Well, where is she?
Oh, baby.
my mother wishes for me to represent exactly what she says...
nothing else. -What?
may I talk to you? -You mean your mother?
Yeah. Sure.
you can talk to me.
I don't have to sleep first?
what's wrong? Come on, sit down.
I'm sorry.
did you give this money to my daughter?
I made a deal with the kids. All the kids.
Oh, no! Please.
you don't tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune...
for looking on the beach for stones?
what is the word for this? -Sea glass.
no, not a name for the stones.
a name for the action, what you did.
Oh, boy, Engreido is gonna be rough.
smug.
I had no idea it was going to amount to that much money.
I thought, sort of tops, $50.
but $50 is a lot of money.
I know.
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry. Come on.
I get what you're upset about.
excuse me.
it might not look it, but I am good at getting things.
I know what it's like when you feel your kid's being messed with.
it won't happen again.
it won't.
all right. -Okay.
it's late. You guys get some sleep.
sleep?
no.
if this was small enough to be helped by some little apology...
I would be a fool to bring it up.
but I need to say, no matter what the result...
I need to be impolite.
you leave someone else's child alone.
it is simple, no?
it is too easy for children to feel contradictions...
and it encourages questioning their parents.
and that makes them feel less safe.
look.
your wife takes her for little tours.
and she changes her hair.
and you give her money.
here, take back the money.
I didn't really mean to be angry to you. Only emotional, for me.
what about hypocritical?
Yes, you heard me! It's not like you didn't do the same thing.
Yes, you did.
so why don't you go lecture yourself? You won't need a translator for that one.
what am I lately, a recycling bin?
anybody dump in your garbage and hope I make something useful out of it?
Yes, you did the same thing.
you think I don't know about you altering those outfits for Bernie?
she tells me her stuff.
so am I missing something?
is there really a difference between that and what you're complaining about?
excuse me.
there's no difference. I interfered.
you're kidding me?
it's just pretty wild to say something to somebody...
and have the other person just concede the point.
I'm dazed here.
I feel really embarrassed.
and you were very right. Hypocrisy, yes.
okay, that doesn't happen very often.
she said we'll leave whenever it is good for you.
No! Come on, man.
but how can I keep working for you after we talked like this?
you can't quit the job.
even if you wanted to. And you know why.
no.
Yes, you do.
you know.
Why?
because if you do...
Cristina will blame herself for costing you the job.
and that guilt...
I don't know if you know about guilt.
guilt, we know. We're Catholics.
we know.
you can't do that to her.
welcome back.
good night.
good night.
you can't be translating for me all the time. I need to learn English now.
I really wasn't supposed to translate that.
listen to your mother. She knows it all.
learning English would cost $599 down...
and 12 monthly payments of $86...
which represents 22% interest.
assimilation gets expensive.
but not a penny was wasted.
food.
food.
I am just learning English. -I am just learning English.
please repeat. -Please repeat.
neck. -Neck.
nose. -Nose.
go!
it is summer...
... winter... -...winter...
...spring.
sun.
sunny. -Sunny.
no. -Several.
several. -Several.
again. -Several.
good. Several.
too many. -Too many.
right. Too many.
how about a movie tonight?
have you any particular one in mind?
I really enjoyed the Star Wars trilogy...
by Mr. George Lucas.
congratulations, John.
chef, it just keeps building.
sorry.
should we stop answering the phone? We're booked for four months solid.
no.
I want to keep some walk-in business. I want this to stay neighborhood.
the trick is stay the same. -lmpossible, John. There'd be riots.
you should hear the desperation in their voices.
this is the best time of your life.
Yes, that includes our 5: 30 seating as well.
I know. Could you hold for one minute?
we'll serve the full menu at the bar.
where will I put people waiting for a table? It won't work, John.
do this for me. -There's no way.
do this for me or I'll set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face!
Yeah, you're right.
that was an unusual way for me to make myself understood.
phone!
it's Mike. -Great.
Yeah, I'm just walking out the door. Okey-okey. Okay, thanks.
great. Thank you.
thank you for the ride home...
but it was not necessary.
all right, yes.
four stars and I've never been more unhappy.
up. Yes.
he's got this. Incredible obstacle.
I don't know what to wear to the party.
I'm wearing jeans.
do you want to wear jeans?
what are you wearing to the party?
who's always there for you at 2: 30 in the morning?
you'd better do something about Chum. You're gonna throw your arm out.
don't you sleep anymore?
the more you do it, the more you learn.
Flor, you're doing fantastic.
no. -Yes.
now I am like a 2-year-old.
I finish.
no, keep going. No, not until you finish it.
your wife go out.
did she say where? -No.
sorry.
listen, she's...
I forgot she was going out. Don't be a smart-ass.
I'm sorry.
you and l...
we communicate in apologies anyway...
so I'm sorry. I should be whipped.
I should be stoned. It's been a while.
I meant to say don't be smart...
not a smart-ass.
don't be kind.
don't be sensitive.
don't be wonderful.
I'm way too close. I'm sorry again.
I meant to say, "Hi, Flor."
good night, Flor.
that show you're watching is gonna be a hit.
Hey, pal, you want to...
go, Chum. No!
go to him. Go!
man, you do love me. I was wondering.
what about the point I'm making? It's good, right?
Cristina has already read, on her own...
every book on Bernice's summer reading list.
and she's two grades behind her.
can you imagine if she went to Bernice's school?
I think I could probably get her a scholarship. God knows they owe me.
talk to Flor.
Yeah. She's so open to new things.
Where're you going?
I'm going out.
it's this whole... Anyway, I'm probably actually gonna be...
the cell will be bad, so I'll just check in with you later.
I just can't find my keys.
good morning, Ms. Folsom.
Deborah. -Arlene, what a surprise.
this is Cristina, the girl I am always raving to you about.
this is Arlene Folsom, she's the School Director.
Hi. -Hello, a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom.
would you like a little tour? -Really?
great.
she's gorgeous, isn't she?
Hispanic.
we ran into the head of the school and Cristina knocked her out.
I had nothing to do with it.
incidentally, the scholarship...
is worth $20, 000 and early registration is tomorrow.
it's too far from my home.
you could move in to town with us.
never, thank you.
fine, then don't.
by the way, the phrase is "no, thank you."
mom was caught in a vise of manipulation.
please, dear God...
this is the most important prayer of my life.
it's about my education. The health of my brain.
please, dear God, enter my mother's heart.
make her understand what this school means.
Hi, Flor. -Hi.
want some port?
no, thank you, Evelyn.
how you doing? -Hi.
I was just leaving.
what? Okay.
poor guy. -What?
nobody noticed.
flor?
thanks for never judging me.
I love you. I love everybody. That's what's killing me.
may I talk with you?
me?
I just spoke to Deborah.
she'll be back soon if you need to go over something.
I need to really talk. Is okay?
no. -No! Sure.
sure. I'm sorry.
outside? -Okay.
you have me a little nervous here.
are we ever gonna stop? Just asking.
you know about Cristina and your private school?
Oh, that.
they did it. -I don't know what to do.
don't ask me. I'm worried about my own kid going there.
they keep sending her home anxiety-ridden, mostly over geometry.
I mean, you get Bernice. In a decent world...
her school should let her know how great she is, right?
you don't have to worry about Bernice.
nothing is going to change that heart.
Yeah, thanks.
it's just...
great to hear someone else say that out loud.
hard to explain.
I'm sorry. I take you here and...
I make too much of this, right? -No!
you have a right to worry about this. This is the job. These are the decisions.
worrying about your children is sanity.
and being that sane, the way you are, can drive you nuts.
someone like you, I'm sorry.
if you think you're at some crossroads, you are.
you are.
Hey, I wish I could help you more.
I never know a man who can put himself in my place like you do.
how did you become that man?
I don't know.
would you get out of the damn wind? Sit down!
I didn't mean to... I want to be helpful.
it must be hard being a widow, doing it on your own.
why do you think I am a widow?
I guess I thought...
that would be the only way a guy would leave you.
so, okay...
are you gonna send her?
I don't know.
I think if I do, one of two things happens.
either she will be odd?
odd, yes.
or she will make herself the same as them.
I felt the same way about my kid going there.
so between odd and the same, you gotta be rooting for odd, don't you?
Yes, you gotta.
thank you. Good night. I go to sleep.
you speaking English, it's...
what? -Nothing.
it's nice meeting you.
here they are.
Hey, you guys just made it. I was getting worried.
I picked up your books yesterday.
I put them in one of Bernie's old, ancient backpacks.
thank you. This is gonna be a great school.
I can tell by the weight.
I got her just a little first-day-at-a-new-school present.
just a little something from me and Bernie.
it's okay, right? Come on, it's a big day.
what did we get her?
wait.
here it comes. -Hold on.
it's from all of us. Your mom, too.
it's not from me.
let's get going. Don't be late. Come on.
thank you so much for this opportunity.
and everything.
have a great year, girls.
this is so great.
left.
no left.
you're fast. Better pace yourself.
you know, I ran college track. Watch out.
look, they're delivering my table.
see you.
I love you for trying!
when people exist under one roof, a tiny society forms...
the stuff of novellas...
masters and servants unconsciously dancing in lock step...
so that when things go wrong...
traumas converge.
at Mrs. Clasky's urging, I had invited two of my friends to her house...
though I was expected at home.
Monica had finally managed to get her mother here from Mexico...
and my mother was making a party.
flor? Deb.
sorry to call you so late.
but the girls are still studying and I gotta go out.
I know I promised to get her back...
so if you want me to cut off the schoolwork...
that's fine, whatever you want.
let me think.
okay, you think about it.
Hey, listen, Flor, if you're tired...
or you want to play, just...
Iet her sleep here tonight. I'll get her back to you in the morning.
you think about it. Call me back. Bye.
wait. I need to talk to you privately, honey.
"honey"? No, Mother. I can't right now.
I'm really late. I've been looking all over for you.
will you keep an eye on the kids? You've my secret cell number.
just give me a moment to talk here.
what is it, are you buzzed? -No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
Yes. Nobody noticed.
which shows I probably conducted myself pretty well as a drunk.
but duty called, and I'm sober...
so, may I say just one thing?
Yes, Mother, one thing. Go ahead. -Thank you.
Deborah, you are going to lose your husband...
if you don't stop what you are doing.
and you will never find someone as good.
there'll only be men who you know are cheap and shallow...
and have no real warmth in their souls.
you may have gotten by on those surfaces once but now...
you have been spoiled by a good man.
if you do not act quickly...
you will soon cement an awful fate for yourself...
a life with no hope of repair...
which has already begun to turn desperate and dumb.
that's it. Drive carefully.
out of coffee. It's over for me.
you've done it again, Mother. Made me hate myself.
one of the things that I can count on.
honey, lately your low self-esteem is just good common sense.
better wait a minute.
what the hell is wrong? -Nothing.
can I urge you, in all hopelessness, not to go in there?
where are you? -Over here.
baby, what?
just stay there, John.
what?
I suddenly get what I gotta do, but I just gotta get up the guts.
is it absolutely necessary to make it this scary?
can you just say it?
it's not so easy.
Yeah. Come on, it's me. We can talk.
do I ever hope so. -All right. Don't cry.
or cry. I'm sorry.
come on. What is it?
I've been seeing another man for the last 1 1 weeks.
it was nothing and I ended it tonight.
at first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market, and then it was...
me being insecure and searching for some ridiculous validation.
hold on.
I'm missing what you're saying.
you can't keep talking...
and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did.
just what did you hear?
there was a crack in the planet.
that was noisy.
there's an actual noise in my head. No kidding.
I met him
if you talk that fast, I'm not gonna hear you.
there's a lot going through my mind right now.
have you said, yet, whether you slept with him?
no, so far I've just been talking about a flirtation. It's really
have you said whether you had sex with another person?
because I really am missing your words, so help me out here.
I've been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks
you still haven't said yet, right?
ls this your way-- -Yes. This is my way!
this is my way of asking you whether or not you...
once I ask it...
just give me a second.
I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to avoid knowing.
no. Damn it.
there's not.
okay, you're on.
real short answer. Have you had-- -Yes.
Really?
I made up my mind that I was gonna answer every question you had.
I'll answer everything, and anything, and more.
what other questions could there be?
are you really that much nicer than me?
you don't set the bar real high.
John, just wait, please.
I think that if you listen to exactly what happened...
and then you could do whatever you need to.
just please let me tell you everything.
it's just Flor.
Flor, what are you doing here?
I want my daughter.
I want to talk to Mrs. Clasky.
I want to quit.
I don't think you can do any of that right now.
I gotta.
the reason I took this chance in telling is that I want us to be good.
I want us to be close.
I want to feel like you're not nuts to be in love with me.
so what I think we should do is that I think we should just talk.
talk until we pass out.
talk until we are so sick of each other that there's nothing left to do...
but take that first step out of hell.
so let's not leave this room until you've heard...
and said everything, okay? Please say okay.
I'm sorry. What?
John? You didn't hear me?
I gotta get out of here and you keep talking. Stay put.
I don't think you want to wake her up...
when you're feeling this upset and the others are right there, too.
What're you doing? Where're you going?
I am leaving. I have finally
me, too. I'll drive you.
no. -It's okay. I don't mind.
if you truly don't know why I say no...
let me at last say the reason. -Don't worry about it.
have you no idea that l...
I've really gotta get out of here. Right now.
go.
goodbye, Chum.
goodbye. -Wait. I'm taking you.
no. Why?
because, if I don't, I'll worry about you all night long. I can't handle that now.
come on. Get in the car.
John!
I quit this job. -I quit this job!
I think I meant that for someone else. I'm sorry.
sorry. Very sorry. -There is the bus stop.
Bye. -Wait, don't go!
would you be willing to hang out with me for a while?
you want to hang out with me? -Yes.
then I have to ask you... -What?
what does "hang out" mean?
it means...
visit.
okay.
I've never seen your place.
very perfect.
I'm gonna cook for you.
please.
I am glad to visit with you.
if I just left the job...
and never spoke with you...
it would have been...
sin.
you understand?
Yeah.
my hand is the only sane part of my body. Every other part wants to jump off a cliff.
that's it for now. I already broke my record for smooth.
I don't understand. -It's me. I'm not making any sense.
but I can get you fed.
you want a drink? -No.
wait. I don't think you should, either.
then, excuse me, because...
if I had the equipment, I think I'd inject the vodka.
I just think it is important we are each clear-headed.
it's very good.
you didn't ask why.
keep things real, right?
I wouldn't have put it so well.
let's get this going here.
beautiful.
so, tell me again why I can't call him on his cell again?
besides that he turned it off?
Yeah. -Forty messages start to look needy.
mother, you're enjoying this. -No.
not in the way you think.
you are enjoying it? Jesus, Mother.
I am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter.
I'm enjoying the fact that I really know how to advise you...
and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented...
that you are gobbling up everything I say.
what?
there's something I want to say to you about you and me.
you don't have to. -No, I want to.
okay? -Thank you.
you were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman...
during my formative years, so I'm in this fix because of you.
it is your fault.
I just needed that moment for us to build on.
you have a solid point, dear.
but right now, the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you.
that's it. That's it for you.
I keep thinking I should tell you what happened to me tonight.
but I don't want to spoil this.
I will remember every taste forever.
I'm very glad you liked it.
it's something, watching you.
if it's anything at your end, imagine over here.
scratch that. The last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks.
don't be crazy. Tell me every detail.
okay, I will.
they should name a gender after you. Looking at you doesn't do it.
staring is the only way that makes any sense.
and trying not to blink, so you don't miss anything.
and all of that, and you're you.
I mean...
look, forgive me.
it's just you are drop-dead, crazy gorgeous.
so much so that I'm actually considering looking at you again...
before we finish up here.
soon, please.
I can't. We can't. -I know.
we can't do anything that brings us any kind of satisfaction or release.
but I'm still having a great time.
my mother has often referred to that evening at the restaurant...
as the conversation of her life.
ever since that night at the beach...
if I knew you were in a room, I just wouldn't go in there.
when I hear you coming, I leave.
that's why we haven't seen each other a lot lately.
why is everything so damn confusing?
is your mind racing, too?
I'd say my mind has evaporated.
feels pretty good.
like happy?
like happy.
you think that will last?
I was just kidding around. -I understand what you mean.
I don't understand what I mean.
that it's getting late.
the responsibilities...
have entered your brain.
don't hide that from me.
please. -Yeah.
thank you. You're right.
I won't. You're great.
you're great, too.
no.
there are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.
please.
are you ready to go? -No! I'm not.
stay put for a second. Stay there.
once our feet touch that floor, I'm gonna get too many brain cells back.
don't be in such a hurry.
that floor, it's going to eat us alive.
I love you. -What?
cause I've been
Oh, God, it's him. He's gotta tell me everything.
no. -Oh, yes.
no, wait.
do you know that right now...
you are your own worst enemy?
that you can't trust one thought in your brain?
then trust me...
and only allow yourself to say one thing to him.
one thing.
l am so glad you're back.
what? -Yes.
but I have to know whether he touched her.
and where he touched her, and how he touched her...
and how he felt afterwards, whether they held hands...
when they left.
just those words, if you want to have a prayer of coming out of this.
so now l... -Go to him.
Jesus, do I need a little makeup? -You need a hose.
but you don't have the time. It's fine that you look like that.
it's genuine. You can use genuine.
thank you, Mom. -Oh, honey.
it's not the worst thing in the world to find out that you love your husband.
it's late, Deborah.
I just wanted to say...
I can't sleep upstairs with you. I just can't for now.
I'm just so glad you're back.
I am. -Yeah, okay.
mom?
I'm done tonight, Deb.
I don't think we can jam anything else in.
it's me, Dad.
what's wrong, honey?
I just wanted to check that you were back and okay.
I'm okay.
because?
mom was crying for six hours straight, and Grandma was in with her...
all that time, mostly saying, "He'll be back."
I just hate that you had that kind of night.
it's good for me to worry about something that really matters...
instead of the stupid stuff that's usually on my mind.
like?
surviving?
what?
how did you come up with this?
you are fantastic, Bernie. I love you.
I love you. -I know.
I mean, not about me being fantastic. But just...
sleep well. -Wait. What?
sweetheart.
me, too.
sing it for Grandma.
Hey, Mom. Is it okay if we don't leave right away, please?
no.
just let me explain, please.
no. We must say goodbye.
Bernice is going to let me use her computer. This is for school.
for school. Just listen to me. -I don't work here anymore.
no, that's not fair.
you can't do this to me.
do I have to get out? -No, Georgie. Stay.
I think you are a wonderful boy.
be good, like you are.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
I can't believe you didn't get out. -Flor said.
I don't want to get you wet.
get me wet. -Thanks.
you are a trip. You are. -Thank you.
you are a beauty.
come on.
last chance to have some of you rub off on me.
listen, I'm sorry that you're sad, but this could have been so much worse.
why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah?
I'm coming.
thank you. -You're welcome.
I live my life for myself.
you live your life for your daughter.
none of it works.
thank you, Evelyn.
we're leaving for good. -It's okay.
we're not coming back! -It's okay.
we're still gonna see each other at school. Come on.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.
come on. No, no.
I got some great things for you. Want a computer?
I was waiting out here.
can't give you guys a lift, huh?
God bless the guy who gets you.
let her keep them. Party favors. -No.
goodbye, Mr. Clasky.
I'm very sorry we won't be seeing each other as frequently.
Yes.
can I sleep at the Claskys' when I stay late at school?
shortly after we left...
my mother told me of another decision she had reached.
I would no longer go to the private school.
No!
you can't do that to me!
you ruined everything.
this ruins my life! You've ruined everything!
I will never forgive you.
no, it'll never be all right. You're wrong.
this is exactly what I was worried about.
I will never be able to forgive you!
I have a scholarship! And nobody gives this up!
the 1. 3 miles from the Clasky house to our bus stop...
was the longest walk I'll ever know.
I had publicly scorned my mother.
and yet she had not reacted.
what did spark our climactic moment...
was my use of a common American phrase.
not right now. I need some space.
not a space between us.
in the midst of confrontation, she found clarity.
she expressed regret that she had to ask me...
to deal with the basic question of my life at such a young age.
and then she asked it.
is what you want for yourself...
to become someone very different...than me?
I have been overwhelmed...by your encouragement to apply to your university...and your list of scholarships available to me.
though, as I hope this essay shows...
your acceptance, while it would thrill me...
will not define me.
my identity rests firmly...
and happily on one fact:
I am my mother's daughter.
thank you. Cristina Moreno.
pointless, really.
do the stars gaze back?
now, that's a question.
but I'm getting ahead of myself.
our story really begins here, 150 years ago at the Royal Academy of Science in London, England, where a letter arrived, containing a very strange inquiry.
it had come from a country boy and the scientist who read it thought it might be a practical joke of some kind.
but he duly wrote a reply politely explaining that the query was nonsense, and posted it to the boy who lived in a village called Wall, so named, the boy had said, for the wall that ran alongside it.
a wall that, according to local folklore, hid an extraordinary secret.
I'm charged with guarding the portal to another world.
and you're asking me to just let you through?
Yes. Because, let's be honest, it's a field.
look, do you see another world out there?
no. You see a field.
do you see anything nonhuman?
no. And you know why?
because it's a field!
hundreds of years, this wall's been here.
hundreds of years, this gap's been under 24-hour guard.
well... One more word and I'll have you up in front of the village council!
well, that sounds rather final. Yeah.
better just go home, then, I suppose.
right, then. Night, Dunstan.
give my best to your father.
stop!
stop!
I don't deal with time-wasters.
get over here and tend this stall.
I'm off to the slaughtered prince for a pint.
see anything you like?
definitely.
I mean, what I meant was these ones, the blue ones.
how much are they?
they might be the color of your hair, or they might be all of your memories before you were three.
I can check if you like.
anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
buy this one instead.
snowdrop.
it'll bring you luck.
but what does that cost?
this one costs a kiss.
is she gone?
follow me.
I'm a princess, tricked into being a witch's slave.
will you liberate me?
it's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.
sorry.
well, if I can't liberate you, what do you want of me?
so, the scientist was wrong.
the wall had successfully done its job of hiding the magical kingdom of Stormhold.
the young man returned that night to his home in England, hoping that his adventure would soon be forgotten.
but nine months later, he received an unexpected souvenir.
this was left at the wall for you.
it says here his name is Tristan.
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.
eighteen years passed, and the baby Tristan grew up knowing nothing of his unconventional heritage.
but never mind how the infant became a boy.
this is the story of how Tristan Thorn becomes a man, a much greater challenge altogether.
for to achieve it, he must win the heart of his one true love.
it's him! It's him!
Humphrey?
no, it's Tristan. Oh.
did I leave something at the shop?
no. I just thought I could bring...
Tristan Thorn, shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.
is there no end to your charms?
Humphrey, there's no need to be like that.
be nice to the poor boy.
were those for Victoria?
you were always useless at fencing in school, Tristan.
in fact, I'm having trouble remembering if there was anything you were good at.
Humphrey, that's enough.
are you all right?
Yeah. Yeah, fine.
want some breakfast?
no, I'm really late for work.
are you all right?
Yeah. Fine. Why?
Oh, I don't know.
last night, how'd it go?
Oh, really good. Really, really good.
Hello, Tristan.
Victoria. Pound of sugar, please.
Yes.
let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.
I also need a sack of potatoes and some chocolate, please.
may I perhaps see you tonight?
no, but you may walk me home.
now?
Yes. Yes, I can.
father, I lost my job.
father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.
Father...you lost your job.
Yes, so I heard.
father, I'm sorry. I...
maybe Mr. Monday was right.
maybe I am deluding myself.
I'm not good enough for Victoria.
he said that? That's poppycock.
you really want to know how it went last night?
Yeah.
not good.
come on. I'm wasting my time.
I'm not like Humphrey.
Tristan, I can tell you that every man I ever envied when I was a boy has led an unremarkable life.
so you don't fit with the popular crowd.
now, I take that as a very good omen.
Tristan, I clearly said...
I know. You told me not to come.
I have something for you. A surprise.
no...
it's not my birthday for another week, you know.
I've never had champagne before.
Yeah, me, neither.
my God! This is delicious!
how did... Well, how does a shop boy afford all of this?
I'm not a shop boy.
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
what are you going to do now?
no. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.
and now I'm not.
now I'm free to live my life as I wish.
this must have been all your savings.
so? I can make more.
that's the beauty of it.
I never intended to stay in Wall, Victoria.
there's a big world out there, I'm gonna make my fortune.
now you sound just like Humphrey.
he's quite a traveler.
do you know he's going all the way to lpswich just to buy me a ring?
lpswich?
Victoria, I'm talking about London or Paris or...
a ring? Why is he...
what kind of a ring?
the word is he's planning to propose to me on my birthday.
he's going to...
and you're gonna say yes.
I can't exactly say no after he's gone all the way to lpswich.
all the way to lpswich?
Victoria, for your hand in marriage, I'd cross oceans or continents.
Really? Yes.
Victoria, for your hand in marriage, I would go to the gold fields of San Francisco and bring you back your weight in gold.
I would.
I'd go to Africa and bring you back a diamond as big as your fist.
or I'd go to the Arctic and I'd slaughter a polar bear and bring you back its head.
a polar bear's head?
you're funny, Tristan.
people like you and people like me, we're just not...
I should be going. It's really late.
well, hold on, then.
let's at least finish the champagne.
okay.
had Tristan known then how the stars watched Earth, he'd have shuddered at the very thought of an audience to his humiliation.
but, fortunately for him, nearly every star in the sky was at that moment looking in earnest at the land on the other side of the wall, where the King of all Stormhold lay on his deathbed, which was a coincidence because it was the King's final act that would change the course of Tristan's destiny forever.
where is Secundus?
he's on his way, Father.
then we shall wait.
sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.
Septimus.
primus.
Tertius.
so, to the matter of succession.
of my seven sons, there are four of you today still standing.
this is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.
and you killed them all for your throne before your father, the King, even felt poorly.
we know, Father.
you're strong and courageous.
and cunning. Most importantly, cunning.
secundus. -Yes, Father?
look through the window.
tell me what you see.
I see the kingdom, Father.
the whole of Stormhold.
And? My kingdom?
maybe. Look up.
secundus. Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.
you're alive. You're...stuck like this till the new king is crowned.
I was that close.
well, at least you haven't lost your looks.
Oh, please. You're not annoyed about that whole murder thing, are you?
I mean, that was 10 years ago. Yeah.
great deal of good it did you, didn't it, killing me, Secundus?
because now, of course, now you are King of all Stormhold.
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not. You're dead.
una? Una?
no, Father, it's me, your son.
Tertius.
where is your sister, Una?
sorry, Father.
nobody has seen Una for years now.
Septimus? What?
tradition dictates the throne must pass to a male heir.
exactly, Father.
so why would I kill my sister when these cretins are still alive?
indeed.
therefore, we shall resolve the situation in a non-traditional manner.
only he of royal blood can restore the ruby.
and the one of you that does so shall be the new King of Stormhold.
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!
beautiful.
more beautiful than a fancy ring from lpswich?
Victoria, for your hand in marriage, I'd cross the wall and I'd bring you back that fallen star.
you can't cross the wall.
nobody crosses the wall.
now you're just being silly.
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.
for you, I'd do anything.
my very own star.
it seems we have ourselves an agreement.
you have exactly one week or I'm marrying Humphrey.
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!
what is it? A star has fallen.
where are the Babylon candles?
you used the last one, Lamia, 200 years ago. Do you not recall?
perhaps we can obtain another.
has your mind become as decrepit as your face, Empusa?
you speak as if such things are freely available.
I know, sister, I merely thought...
you'd have us hunting for a Babylon candle while some other witch finds our star.
fool. There's no time to waste.
if we must retrieve it on foot, then we shall.
Mormo, we need information.
if these divinations are correct, the fallen star lies 100 miles away.
four centuries we've waited for this.
what hardship a few more days?
which of us shall go, then, to seek it and bring it back?
I've his kidney. I've his liver.
and I've his heart.
you'll be needing what's left of the last star.
there's not much left.
soon, there'll be plenty for us all.
Dunstan Thorn. Not again.
it's Tristan, actually.
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.
and I suppose you intend to cross the wall as well, do you?
well, you can forget it. Go home.
cross the wall as well as who?
no one. Nobody.
nobody crosses the wall. You know that!
everybody knows that!
yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.
well, I better just head for the old homestead, then.
Yeah.
right, then. Night, Tristan.
good night.
give my best to your father.
off you go.
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?
no, I'm fine.
that Humphrey again? - No.
actually, it was the guard.
the guard at the wall.
Tristan, he's 97 years old.
well, that's given him plenty of time to practice, then, hasn't it?
why, may I ask, were you trying to cross the wall?
I might ask you the same thing.
I have a mother.
I mean, I have a mother.
she could still be alive.
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.
the chain you cut.
just like you said.
and...
and the glass flower.
the flower she sold to you.
she told me it would bring me luck.
thank you.
this was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.
it's addressed to you.
Yep.
my dearest Tristan, please know that I only ever wanted the best for you.
had my mistress allowed it, I would have kept you in a heartbeat.
my dearest wish is that we will meet someday.
the fastest way to travel is by candlelight.
to use it, think of me and only me.
I will think of you every day, for always.
your mother.
well, do you... Do you have a light?
mother?
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
are you all right?
no, I'm not.
and I'm not your mother, so get off me!
you're... You're not my mother?
do I look like I'm your mother?
no.
sorry.
well, are you all right?
do you want some help?
you can help by leaving me alone!
all right.
Oh, my God.
light the candle and think of me.
I was. I was thinking of my...
but then Victoria and the star just popped into...
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.
this may seem strange, but have you seen a fallen star anywhere?
you're funny. - No, really, we're in a crater.
this must be where it fell.
Yeah, this is where it fell.
it is. Or if you want to be really specific, up there is where this weird, bloody necklace came out of nowhere and knocked it out of the heavens when it was minding its own business.
and over there is where it landed.
and right here, this is where it got hit by a magical flying moron!
you're the star! You're the star? Really?
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...
may I just say in advance that I am sorry?
sorry for what? For this.
now, if I am not mistaken, this means you have to come with me.
see, you're going to be a birthday gift for Victoria, my true love.
but of course!
nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped, injured woman!
I'm not going anywhere with you.
hurry. You should be on your way now, Primus.
you must find the royal necklace with the ruby before your brothers.
I should like to see you take the throne.
the first benevolent king.
I don't doubt Stormhold would be a better place under your rule.
Really?
well, that is fascinating.
don't you think, Tertius?
Yes, indeed.
prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
well, well, I...
since you're all here, won't you join me in a toast?
what a very good idea.
to the new King of Stormhold, whichever of you fine fellows it might be.
to the new King of Stormhold.
you!
you really thought that you were king?
you killed the Bishop?
no, Primus.
I think you'll find that you killed the Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling with your conscience, may I suggest you return to your chamber?
leave the quest for the stone to me.
how have we lived this way all these years?
in my absence, I expect you to make it fit for the queens we are.
when I return with our prize, all of us shall be young again.
never fear, my sisters.
I will not fail.
don't you ever sleep?
not at night.
may have escaped your notice, genius, but that's when stars have rather better things to do.
they're coming out, shining, that sort of thing.
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours, but you're not in the sky anymore.
coming out is off the agenda.
shining has been suspended until further notice.
Oh, and sleeping during the day is O-U-T.
unless you have some magical ability to sleep while you're walking.
have you not got it into your thick head yet?
I'm not walking anywhere!
fine.
sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.
I was gonna put you back in the sky once I'd brought you to my Victoria, but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own in the middle of nowhere forever.
and just how were you planning to get me back to the sky?
I find the fastest way to travel is by candlelight.
you've got a Babylon candle. - Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.
a Babylon candle. - That's what I said.
you said "Bubbling."
anyway, I was going to give what's left of it to you.
well, that barely has one use left.
so be grateful I'm not using it right now to get us both back to the wall.
unless you have a better way of getting yourself home.
fine!
help me up.
all right. All right. I'm helping.
and you are gonna have to walk quicker than that.
otherwise, I'll never get you back to Victoria in a week.
don't push your luck.
don't take less than a florin for him, Bernard! You understand?
Yes, Mother. - No dilly-dallying!
and don't even think of stopping at the tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!
a florin for your goat, boy.
Oh.
he's a bit small to pull your cart.
you're quite right.
that's much better.
Bernard!
Bernard!
get on!
who goes there?
what do you want with me, a poor old flower...
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are and I swear by the ordinances of the sisterhood to which we both belong that I mean you no harm this day.
I wish to share your meal.
well, one can never be too careful.
sit down. I'll get you a seat.
anything else? - Nope.
what's it to be?
heads or tails?
heads.
so, stranger, where are you headed off to on this fine day?
I seek a fallen star.
she fell not far from here.
and when I find her, I shall take my great knife and cut out her heart while she still lives.
and the glory of our youth shall be restored.
fallen star?
that's the best news I've had in ages.
I could do with losing a few years meself.
so whereabouts did you...
limbus grass!
you dare to steal truth from my lips by feeding me limbus grass?
do you have any idea what a big mistake you've made,
Ditchwater Sal?
how do you know my...
who are you? - Look again.
I shall not seek the star, Your Dark Majesty. I swear.
seek all you wish.
you shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.
you will not perceive her even if she stands before you.
pray you never meet me again, Ditchwater Sal.
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.
you think you know we're going the right way because...
and I quote, I just do.
I do, though. I don't know why.
maybe it's my love for Victoria guiding me home.
please. - Yvonne, whether you like it or not...
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...
how many times do I have to...
would you... Would you please slow down?
Yes, yes.
look, we're... We're going north, all right?
the wall's north.
and if you look up in the sky, even during the day, you can see the...the evening star.
that's so weird.
that's funny. Hilarious. My sides are splitting.
no, I'm being...
wait that... That was you! Really?
what... What are...
what are you doing? - What does it look like I'm doing?
sitting down. I'm tired. - Please don't do this again.
we agreed we'd stop off at the next village to eat and rest.
come on, Tristan. It's midday.
I never stay up this late!
just, please, let me sleep!
okay, you... Well, then I'll... - You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.
what are you doing?
what does it look like I'm doing? I'm making sure you don't run away.
your Highness, the soothsayer, as you requested.
south, you said.
south we went.
still no stone.
do you now propose we start swimming?
sire, I've merely relayed to you what the runes have told me.
I can do no more.
well, consult them again.
wait.
before we seek the stone, I have another question.
am I the seventh son?
Yes.
another question.
is my favorite color blue?
Yes.
has excessive begging or pleading ever persuaded me to spare the life of a traitor?
what does that mean?
that means no. - Good.
throw them again. This time, throw them high.
do you work for my brother?
so, do we continue west?
Tristan?
who's there?
Tristan, is that you?
it's not funny.
Tristan?
come on.
be careful how much magic you use, sister.
it's beginning to show.
one goat and a small enchantment.
hardly extravagant.
well, even using the ring will take its toll.
better you call on us only in dire need.
and use your runes to locate the star yourself.
I used them and she should be here.
but now they're just telling me gibberish.
it is because you must stay where you are, my sister.
she is coming to you.
Oh, be warned, Lamia. Delicacy is needed.
misery has drained her. She's barely shining.
set a trap that ensures her heart is glowing before you cut it out.
Yvaine! Yvaine!
Oh, you idiot.
you shall become human.
you are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.
now, make everything ready.
our special guest will be here soon.
I mean, who's to say he'd have even kept his promise about the candle?
I just refuse to believe he's the only person in Stormhold who could've helped me.
going on and on and on. Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."
Tristan?
please protect our sister, Tristan.
Yvaine is in grave danger.
the unicorn came to help her.
but now they're heading into a trap.
no star is safe in Stormhold.
the last to fall, 400 years ago, was captured by the same witches who seek Yvaine now.
they tricked her, cared for her, and when her heart was once more aglow, they cut it from her chest and ate it.
there's no time to waste.
a coach is coming.
by any means possible, you must get on it.
run.
Whoa!
if Septimus insists on sending a boy to do a man's job...
no, no, no, wait, please!
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.
look at me, look at me. I'm unarmed. Please.
please, let me ride with you.
I'm afraid that's impossible. I'm on a quest of enormous importance.
well, then all the more reason to take me with you.
there may come a time when you need a second pair of hands. Sir?
please. Maybe providence sent me to you just as it sent you to me.
get on. - Oh, yes. Thank you.
goodness me, my dear. Come in out of this wretched rain!
we have food and drink, a warm bed and plenty of hot water for a bath.
how do you like your bath? Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?
I honestly don't know.
then let me choose for you, and I'll have my husband take your horse to the stable.
Billy?
now, let's get you out of your wet things, shall we?
feeling better?
much. Thank you.
the warm water's actually done me a world of good.
you see? The powers of a nice, hot bath.
and your leg? Any improvement?
that is extraordinary.
it's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.
you seem happier in yourself, too.
I do feel happier. Less troubled.
wonderful.
nothing like a nice soak to warm the cockles of your heart.
now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife, but I've been told I have a healer's hands.
I'd be glad to give you a massage.
what's a massage?
never had... Well, bless my soul.
nothing like a massage to send you off for the finest and deepest night's sleep.
I do have trouble sleeping at night.
lie on your back, dear.
why not close your eyes?
you'll drift off better that way.
Hello!
service!
maybe we should carry on and try the next inn, especially if this stone is as close as your runes say.
I'll give it one more try.
relax here, my love.
I'll be back just as soon as I've taken care of this customer.
at last. We require accommodation.
please help my friend take the horses to the stables.
Hello!
Oh.
I'm accustomed to better service, but you're awake now and that's what counts.
prepare your best room.
she got the stone. - Stone, stone.
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.
glass of wine?
no, no, no, no, no.
no.
until my brother is dead, I have vowed to drink only my own wine.
though my friend in the stables might be glad of a drop.
your best room, perhaps?
of course.
I'm sorry. I presumed that...
traveling alone, are you?
I've just stabled my four black stallions and my carriage.
well, I say mine. It belonged to my late father.
thank you.
that's so kind, thank you very much.
my name's Tristan. What's yours?
Bernard.
there was not a horse or beast he could not master.
so much so that in his youth, he took to riding a camel, which was comical.
when he passed, the carriage came to me.
she's got the stone!
she's got it! She's got it!
and it's the largest in all of Stormhold, so they say.
how nice for you. If you'll excuse me.
wait.
that stone you're wearing. It can't be.
Oh, finally. - Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.
well done. Sweet.
come here. Let me see it.
you have no idea what you're meddling with.
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold and I demand that you bring it to me!
bring me the stone! Now!
prince Primus! Don't touch anything they give you!
they tried to...
are you all right? Billy!
get him!
the burning golden heart of a star at peace is so much better than your frightened little heart.
even so, better than no heart at all.
Yvaine? Hold me tight and think of home.
No!
what the hell did you do?
what did I do? What did you do?
think of home! That was a great plan!
you thought of your home and I thought of mine and now we're halfway between the two!
Oh, you stupid cow! What did you think of your home for?
you just said "home"!
if you wanted me to think of your home, you should have said!
some crazy lady was going to cut your heart out and you wanted more specific instructions?
perhaps you'd like it in writing! Or a diagram, maybe!
look, Captain Shakespeare! Caught ourselves a little bonus!
a couple of Lightning Marshals!
they don't look like Lightning Marshals to me.
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?
well, let's think.
maybe for the same godforsaken reason we are!
now, who are you?
let's see if a night on our lovely brig will loosen their lips!
get them in the brig!
you heard the man! Let's go!
get them into the brig and the rest of you dirty dogs, back to work!
we've got lightning to catch! Come on!
they're going to kill us, aren't they? - I don't know.
you know, it's funny. I used to watch...
I used to watch people having adventures.
I envied them.
you ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?
what? So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?
no. No, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.
look, I admire you dreaming.
shop boy like me, I could never have imagined an adventure this big in order to have wished for it.
I just thought I'd find some lump of celestial rock and take it home, and that would be it.
and you got me.
if there's one thing I've learned in all my years watching Earth, it's that people aren't what they may seem.
there are shop boys and there are boys who just happen to work in shops for the time being.
and trust me, Tristan, you're no shop boy.
you saved my life. Thank you.
well, well, well.
the last brother dead, which means that I'm king.
I'm king!
not yet, brother.
damn. I still need the stone.
your brother doesn't have it? - Well, why don't you find out?
where is my stone?
I don't...
the man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.
what girl? I don't know.
a girl. She got away.
because this was a trap set up for her, but your brother, he come just straight into it.
a trap? Set by who?
a woman you should pray you'll never meet.
she's...
she's gone. She took your brother's carriage.
this woman wanted my stone?
no. She wanted the girl's heart.
she said the girl was a star and she wanted to cut out her heart and...
eat it?
Oh, my God.
do you have any idea what this means?
everlasting life.
king forever.
it's not here, sire.
this idiot's coming with us.
ask again. - We have asked again and the answer is still the same. She is airborne!
well, she can't remain so forever.
inform me as soon as she touches ground!
immediately! Do you understand?
watch your tongue, sister!
it is you and not we who've lost her.
lost her and broken the knife!
even if you apprehend her, how will you complete the deed?
perhaps you should return now and one of us set out in your place.
don't be absurd.
I'll bring her home and deal with her there.
be sure everything is ready for our arrival.
tell me about Victoria then.
well, she...
there's nothing more to tell you.
because the little I know about love is that it's unconditional.
it's not something you can buy.
hang on. This wasn't about me buying her love.
this was a way for me to prove how I felt.
and what's she doing to prove how she feels about you?
well...
look, Yvaine, you'll understand when you meet her. All right?
provided we don't get murdered by pirates first.
murdered by pirates. Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria. I can't quite decide which sounds more fun.
we've located the sky vessel.
it's headed north for the port town on Mount Drummond and you are no longer the only one seeking the star.
there's someone following your tracks!
a witch? A warlock?
a prince and he's catching you up!
get a move on!
so, this is the part where you tell me who you are and why you're up here.
or I'll snap her pretty little fingers one by one like dry twigs!
my name is Tristan Thorn.
this is my wife, Yvaine. - Your wife?
far too young and radiant to belong to just one man!
it's share and share alike aboard my vessel, sonny boy!
if you dare even touch her...
you may think you're showing a little spirit in front of your lady friend, but if you talk back to me again, I'll feed your tongue to the dogs, you impertinent little pup!
sir? - Better! But still interrupting.
let's see. A hanging's always good for morale!
maybe we'll watch you dance a gallows jig!
or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side and have done with it!
it's a very long way down.
plenty of time to reminisce about your pitifully short lives.
please, look, we're just trying to make our way home, back to a place called Wall, where I come from.
what did you say?
I said we were trying to get home to Wall.
that's one lie too many, my son.
wall? Shut up.
what's he saying?
thought you could just wander onto my patch, did you?
he is. Yeah, he's gonna...and live to tell the tale?
all right, go, on the deck, on the deck, on the deck! Now, go, go, go!
big mistake, Mr. Thorn!
and the last one you'll ever make!
No! No! You brute! Come... Come on!
you murderer! You pig!
come on! Get up! Get up!
I'm taking the girl to my cabin, and mark my words, anyone who disturbs me for the next few hours will get the same treatment! - What? You'll...
no, you idiot! I'll sling you over the side as well!
Oh, yeah.
never say no.
well, this is Kingman's defining moment, Marv.
if they win, they guarantee themselves a spot in the playoffs.
everybody get on the King's back and I'm going to lead you to the promised land.
all right? On one, on one. Ready? - Break!
go deep. Watch your left!
let's go!
pick him up. Pick him up.
Sanders. Sanders.
go wide!
hut-hut!
Hut!
all right, here's Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.
he's got Sanders wide open in the end zone.
Kingman is on the run. He's inside the five.
he stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.
and he is in! Touchdown, Rebels. They've won it.
what a tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.
but I have to wonder, yesterday he was...
the King does it again!
go Joe! - Go Joe!
never say no! - Never say no!
Yeah!
WZPZ FM.
Hey, Boston. Happy New Year. And a special shout out to our Rebels.
don't party too hard, boys.
you're going to need all your strength to bring home that championship.
enjoy your drink. - To us.
hope it's okay.
I'm telling you guys, these aren't the normal onion rings.
they got garlic and mint leaves. I mean, like, beluga caviar.
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.
see the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress? - Oh, yeah.
I think she said you have a killer smile, bro.
I do.
you should go talk to her.
you think so? - I know so. Come on.
get in there. Get in there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.
use some of this. Chicks dig it.
Webber, you got a pen? - Why?
because you might want to take some notes.
what's up?
Webber!
I told you, they bumped up shoot. I have to catch last flight to Paris.
but Tatianna will miss you.
the King doesn't want his queen to miss him too much.
so I got you a little something special.
close your eyes. - Okay.
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one? Which one?
no peeking.
dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.
happy New Year.
Chanel? - - Or Chanel.
whoa, Sanders. Where you going?
just past your bedtime?
Yeah, well, you know, it's New Year's Eve.
want to go home, hug the wife, kiss the kids.
all right, thanks for coming. Happy New Year.
all right, Happy New Year. - All right, see you at practice.
all right, see you.
all right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.
now, just give me back the wallet, all right?
I'm looking to confiscate Sanders' man card, but his wife, Maria, has already done it.
Yes, really... - Come on. Get a life, Sanders.
Oh, you call this "life"? That ain't life, Joe.
whatever. - He's mad. That was funny, man.
who's ready to party? - I am.
party!
where can I get a man card?
Why? The night is still young! - We can walk Spike.
play the guitars, Joe. Come on. - We were just bounding.
I love that idea. - We're starting to jell.
call me. - Joe...
we were doing so good.
Hey, Spike. There's my boy. Haven't seen you all night.
do you know who the greatest quarterback of all time is?
just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!
can you feel it? Can you smell it? Do you believe it?
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready? Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!
come on, Spike. We need a football biscuit.
Oh, that's a good one. Oh, this is a good one.
Kingman drops back, he's... Oh, defenders are coming around.
post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.
he throws.
Touchdown! They're going crazy.
crazy.
Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.
what do you want to do, Spike? What do you want to do today?
it's a new year.
you want to play football? You want to go for a walk?
you want to watch the new ESPN special profile on Joe Kingman?
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch. Here we go.
Attaboy.
blessed with crazy strength and ridiculous agility...
ridiculous.
...Joe Kingman could have succeeded on talent alone.
but what really sets this future hall-of-famer apart is his passion for the game.
and no one sums it up better than Joe himself.
wait a minute, that's not what I said. - Listen, listen.
what I said was this. Life... - Life...
...holds many pleasures for me. ... holds many pleasures for me.
but... - But...
...nothing... ... nothing...
...nothing beats the thrill... ... nothing beats the thrill...
...of playing on that field... ... of playing on that field...
...every Sunday. ... every Sunday.
football is my life. - Football is my life.
beyond the field... - Beyond the field...
...nothing else matters. ... nothing else matters. Watch this.
nothing matters.
if nothing else really matters, why does that championship ring elude Kingman?
some of the experts say it's because he's too selfish.
I mean, think about it...
how does that sound, Stuey?
Joe, you're a 30-something now, not a 20-something.
the clock is ticking, Joe. Ticking on your career.
blah, blah, blah...
you come talk to me when you have your own action figure, Stuey.
yeah? Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.
I have a visitor here at reception.
a Peyton Kelly, sir. - I don't know any Peytons.
a young lady.
is she cute? - Oh, exceedingly so, sir.
well, what are you waiting for, Larry? Send her up.
he never says "no."
I am the king. Thank you very much.
look out.
hello.
goodbye. Hey!
look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies, okay?
you don't get abs like these eating Peanut Butter Patties, you know?
go ahead, hit me. Come on! Give it a shot. Come on.
it's ridiculous, isn't it?
Bye-bye.
it's ridiculous.
I don't know what it is you're selling. Look what I have, here's a hundo.
I don't want any money. I want...
I know. I know what you want. I get it. It's what the world wants.
an autograph of Joe Kingman. They all want it, eight to 80.
you'll probably go sell it, but I'm going to give it to you for free.
because I'm Joe Kingman, humanitarian.
happy New Year. I'll be right back.
you have a bulldog. Come here, boy.
you're so cute.
easy, easy. He's a very vicious attack dog.
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.
listen, you just can't come walking into strangers' homes like this.
there are a lot of weirdos out there in the world.
didn't your mom ever teach you that? - Yeah.
well, where is she? - On an airplane.
on an airplane? Well, who are you here with?
my father.
well, you better go get him, because I'm sure he's looking for you.
he's not looking for me. - How do you know?
because he's looking at me.
what?
Hi, we've never met before. You were married to my mom, Sara.
Sara Kelly?
my name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.
no. No. Nope. No!
no. Time out. Sara and I never had a kid.
she wrote you a note. - Wrote me a note.
Joe, I know this is a big surprise, but Peyton is your daughter.
I need you to watch her for a month. It's an emergency.
I'll explain everything when I get back. Sara.
you sure got a lot of pictures of yourself in here.
you expect me to believe you're my kid, based on this?
anybody could have written this. - Oh, yeah.
I've also got this. It's my birth certificate.
birth certificate?
your name is on it. - My name is...
my name?
awesome!
ready? Break!
my name's not on this.
joseph Kingman.
Hut! Hut! Hut!
we've got a situation. - Touchdown!
fix it.
don't you think you should have told me about this?
I didn't know. - You didn't know you had an ex-wife?
that was a long time ago. We were crazy in love, but too young.
didn't even last longer than a year, and we never had a baby.
okay, but for argument's sake, is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility that this child could be yours?
think hard.
I don't know.
we got the separation, the divorce was final, she came by to pick up a few of her things and then we...
we...
is anyone else hungry?
hungry? - Joe...
when did this, "We... We... Is anyone else hungry" happen?
about eight, nine years ago.
how old are you, kid? - Eight.
congratulations, Joe.
this isn't happening to me.
muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.
hmm?
it says here that your mom is not coming back for a month.
she's on her way to Africa.
what kind of a selfish, self-centered person dumps their kid...
she's on a water sanitation project bringing fresh drinking water to the drought-ravaged children of the Sudan.
if I had a dime for every time I heard that one.
so on her way to save the world, your mom just suddenly decided to leave you here?
I begged her. I said, "Well, why don't I stay with my father?
and she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't know about you yet. " And I said...
I get it. I get it. So, who else can you stay with?
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.
Sara has a sister.
goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!
Karen. - Karen. What about her?
she's...
she's dead.
Oh, that's convenient.
what?
how do we get in touch with your mom?
her cell won't work in Kassala. - Email?
they don't have Internet there.
how did you get here again?
we flew to Boston together, and then she put me in a car.
and the car just magically dropped you off at some man's house?
not some man. My father. - So you say.
want a paternity test? - Yes. That's a great idea.
let's do that. No problem.
I don't like needles. So if they don't take blood, no problem.
not in the middle of negotiating our Fanny's deal, it's not.
these things never stay quiet, trust me.
if she does turn out to be yours, you'll look like a guy who had a kid and ditched her and you can kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.
Stella. - Hmm.
we don't even look alike.
Oh, no. Not at all.
thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry. - Hey, I told you she was cute.
I'm late.
let's go. No huddle.
no back seat. - So what? Get in the car.
if you get in an accident, the air bag will hurt me.
Oh, come on, I don't have time for the safety lesson, please!
come here.
so late.
I've got four weeks to make up for eight years, so let's get started, shall we?
I'm going to ask you some questions and you're going to give me some answers, okay?
now, for example, if you asked me what my favorite thing to do was, I would say ballet.
so what's your favorite thing to do?
that's easy. Play football.
football.
come on!
if you could only save one thing in a fire, what would it be?
my Heisman.
no, wait... I know.
my limited edition Joe Kingman sneakers.
come on, horse radish. No more questions.
just one more question.
what's the best thing that's ever happened to you?
listen, I got a question for you.
why didn't your mom just bring you here herself?
want a cookie?
no, I don't want a cookie. Stop trying to change the subject.
but you said you were hungry.
and I made them special for you. - Fine, fine.
now, about your mom. - I told you, it was last-minute.
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew would just let her daughter show up at my doorstep alone.
I know what happened.
you do? - Yeah.
she's gained a lot of weight. - No.
what's she pushing now? About 180?
deuce?
let's go.
what do you think, you're some roaming free safety or something?
this is "cover-two," little lady, so stay close.
are you okay?
do I sound okay? What did you put in those cookies?
milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon... - Cinnamon!
cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.
Oh, I'm sorry. - All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"? Cinnamon!
I'm allergic to nuts.
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that publicity shoot set up for you today.
you have to be there this time. - I'll be there.
what do you think, I'm stupid or something?
stop touching me.
stop eating so much.
you're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine. - Start a tab.
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
king's here, Danville. I got it. King's here.
get a submarine sandwich and a diet soda.
all right, let's go. Sixty-six seam, slot left on three, on three. Ready?
suffering succotash, Sylvester, something seems to be wrong with your mouth.
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three. On three. Ready?
Hey, Joe. Looks like you got a rogue fan.
I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter. - What's everybody staring at?
I didn't know Joe had a kid.
yo, I don't think Joe knew Joe had a kid.
stay here. - Yes, sir.
hat.
give me this!
here's what you got to read right there. You all set?
here we go. And three, two, one... Go!
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.
Boston Rebels! Feel the... Wait a minute. Who writes this?
Hey, let's get Joe. He won't be expecting it.
we'll put ice in his bath.
coop, look. Look real close.
Joe is in an ice bath.
well, we'll put colder ice in it. - Glove.
Webber, think about this.
big surprise, eh, Kingman?
more like a safety blitz.
Yeah, well, you should be happy.
I remember how happy I was when my kids were born.
Yeah, but you knew they were coming.
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.
what's your name, sweetheart?
Peyton. - Peyton, that's cute.
Hi, Peyton. - Hi.
Oh, that's cool. Like... Like, Peyton Manning?
no, dude. It's like Walter Payton, right?
no. Peyton Rous.
who's that? - He won the Nobel Prize.
for what team?
in medicine.
he's not even a football player. That's stupid.
"stupid" is a mean word.
no, it isn't. - Yes, it is.
isn't. - Is!
quiet. Both of you.
step away from my pants.
awkward.
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
see, those are Monroe's very special underwear.
you see, he needs to wear them every game, - or he thinks we won't win. - Oh.
Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.
I'm hungry.
please don't touch anything. Stand right here.
tonight's Tuesday. We're going to carbo-load.
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.
what?
Hey, do you have any Jell-O? I want some Jell-O.
like I said, please don't touch. Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.
stand right here, don't do anything.
I'm not giving you 28 grams of empty carbohydrates.
we do not do simple sugars in this house.
but I'm a kid and kids love sugar. I mean, the simpler the better.
well, my dad never let me have sugar.
Oh, is that why you never smile?
listen, you better eat your food before it gets cold.
but it's as big as a mountain.
listen, if you're going to make the pros, you have to get your appetite up.
let's go. Eat.
you got a little...
a little something right here. - What?
I got what?
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.
you can eat.
and finish eating.
I don't have a guest room because I don't like guests.
but you can sleep here.
what's this? - That is a universal remote.
it controls the world. And you don't need to touch it.
what's the "romance" button for?
the romance button is for a little Valentine's Day magic.
turn... Turn this off. Turn it off. Turn it off.
turn it off. Press the button. Turn it off.
stop touching things.
aren't you going to tell me a bedtime story?
bedtime story... Bedtime story.
Yeah.
the Big Bad Wolf blew down the Grammy's house and ate the Goldilocks and then there was something about the porridge.
the end.
good night.
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.
a bedtime story is supposed to make you feel peaceful.
I'll show you.
lean back, relax, and listen to the story.
fine. Fine. I'm going to listen to this one time, then that's it.
then you go to sleep. Do you understand me?
once upon a time there was a princess and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.
she had a pink dress, a red dress, a blue dress, a green dress, a purple dress, - an orange dress, a yellow dress... - I get it. I get it. I get it.
a lot of dresses, a lot of colors. So what?
so each dress had a secret power.
the pink dress, which had pink sparkles all over it, could make her fly.
and the blue dress, which had blue sparkles all over it, could make her tiny.
and the green dress, which had green sparkles all over it, could make her sleep.
Hey, baby.
why didn't you answer me when I called?
I was starting to get worried.
I'm sorry. I forgot I had my phone turned off from the flight.
well, I'm just happy that you got there safely. So, how's it going?
great. Well, the food's not so hot, but my room is huge.
well, that's very cool, but how's the ballet?
I mean, is it as good as they promised?
too soon to tell.
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost time for my flight to take off, but I will call you as soon as I can, okay?
I miss you so much already.
e- mail me lots of pictures. And Peyton, I love you.
I love you, too. Bye.
is there a ballet school close by?
spike?
why is my dog in a dress with pink nail polish?
he's learning Swan Lake.
do you know how to fix a ballerina bun?
do I look like I know how to fix a ballerina bun?
my mom says we're not supposed to pop our knuckles.
well, your mom didn't sleep on a hard sofa instead of her specially designed $ 10, 000 orthopedic bed made by Dr. Johan Gustavo, of Switzerland.
what's... What's with the Beethoven? - It's Tchaikovsky.
do you listen to this every morning? - No.
sometimes I listen to Bach, or Rachmaninoff...
do you have an iPod?
because I'm going to buy you one. Immediately. Right now.
I'm going to buy you an iPod.
until then...
what is this?
my Bedazzler. Doesn't Camille look pretty?
a Bedazzler?
and that's why I use tuna for protein and flavor.
gross. - Little liquid chickens.
Yeah, that's my favorite.
Joe's juice.
okay. That's enough.
I'm gonna need you to drink up.
you'll be running the 40 in under 4. 5 in no time.
that smells worse than school food.
you know, speaking of school, why aren't you in it?
I'm on break. - In January? No you're not.
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school, so I have January off.
Really? Well, guess what? I'm not on break.
as a matter of fact, I'm on the opposite of break.
so I'm gonna need you to come over here, put some hustle in it, and drink your breakfast.
Peyton, stop messing around. - What?
Peyton!
No!
nice.
that's real nice.
you know what a playbook is? - I'm guessing it's a book with plays?
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses and the Os for hugs.
wrong! The X's mean "stay out of these areas of the house."
the O's mean "open access."
for example, you want to go to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.
but now you go to the kitchen, big X.
off limits. No access.
can't go there, because you made a mess in the kitchen.
do you understand?
no trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?
got it. No flea-flickers.
this is your game plan. Learn it. Live it. Love it.
that's it, boys. Practice is over.
pick a nanny, Joe.
I'll take the one at... - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
don't you think you should ask some questions first?
I've got great instincts.
the one on the end, Stella.
Edna.
the other end, Stella.
blondie, you're up.
Oh, no. No.
the King picked me!
we are going to be just like sisters!
Oh, my goodness.
you start tomorrow.
Hey. You're going to the opening tonight, right?
it's my restaurant.
well, what are you going to do with her?
I don't know.
Hi. Hello.
welcome, Mr. Kingman.
the Maloofs! - About time, there, Joe.
you made it. Have fun.
Yeah. - Enjoy yourself.
Hey, Joe. - Hey, man.
how you doing? - Hey.
Jo Jo! - Hey, nice to see you.
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.
and that's exactly what I said. I told them.
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest."
the purple or the yellow?
that's what I was thinking, too.
I'll be back.
water the lawn. Water the lawn.
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.
indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.
Hey, Joe! This way!
number one on the field and number one in your heart.
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
Yes, I do.
when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
what can make me feel this way
my girl
Joe?
my girl
talking about my girl
my girl... Peyton!
Joe?
Joe. Joe, where are you?
there you are. Joe, I thought you forgot about me.
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter? - Peyton!
Hey, Joe, you forget something?
father of the year!
yesterday, Fanny's Burgers agreed to hand out your action figure with every order of fries.
but do you think they're going to want a spokesman who forgot his child in a bar?
my mom says that Fanny's makes kids fat and gives them gas.
well, your daddy's agent says Fanny's makes him fat with cash.
now, I have to put together a press conference, do some cleanup.
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop, and Peyton's the mess.
what?
something funny, Larry? - Just a little throat tickle, sir.
well, get it fixed.
right here. Chop-chop.
you got a station wagon, Stella?
no, you did.
say "bye-bye" to being the Big Bad Dad of Boston.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
you want me to sign that?
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl and cooperate with your daddy and Auntie Stella will get you a nice new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.
and an upgrade on your next international flight.
I'm eight.
listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt, you will do whatever it takes to help your father.
I'll pay for the therapy.
listen, Peyton, what Stella's trying to say here is this right now is crunch time.
so, if something's bothering you, then all you got to do...
let's keep it bottled up until after the playoffs.
fine.
on one condition.
no nanny.
no way.
let's go. Come on. - I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.
everything's all...
dizzy? - I think it might be from that funny yellow soft drink Joe gave me last night.
what was it called again?
margarita?
you wouldn't. - You wouldn't.
try me.
good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!
Hey, Cindy!
you're fired.
Bye.
Joe! Joe!
Hey, Joe, how can you remember the plays when you can't remember you have a daughter?
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing in a nightclub at 3: 00 in the morning?
thank you. Thank you guys so much for coming out.
ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming.
great questions, by the way. Thank you.
as you all know by now, I've recently learned I'm a father.
and clearly, I'm still getting the hang of things.
that's not an excuse, Joe.
but you better believe that Peyton's nightclub evenings are behind her.
because from now on, we're both going to be going to sleep early, right?
now, who's number one on the field and number one in your heart?
let's go.
can I say something, please?
no. Let's go.
Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton, the one who'll be going to bed early from now on.
my dad didn't have much of a heads-up on this whole father thing and he is still getting the hang of things.
but it's like everything else in his life.
he never says "no."
I mean, he's teaching me that you can do anything if you've got motivation and determination.
and the place where that starts is right here, in the heart.
you're the world's greatest father.
that was good.
that was really good. - It's going to cost you.
...two, three, four, grand pli?.
there you go, there you go.
and...
come on, this isn't a sport.
football. Football's a sport.
excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?
hello. This is Peyton.
Hi. - And she's here for this.
so, I guess I'll be back in a couple of hours. Bye.
well, class started 15 minutes ago, and we don't accept students without an audition and that happened last month, so I'm really sorry.
I'm sure maybe we can work something out?
money's no object, as you probably know.
okay, the thing is that this is a professional school, and...
that's very nice. - Thank you.
go change, go on, go change.
let me see how she does today. Okay?
all right.
maybe I'll... I'll try and... We'll get somebody...
the moms sit over there.
excuse me. Thank you.
and one, two, three, very long...
come on, come on.
and one, two, three, four.
open up, like a princess, chin up.
thank you.
beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.
Peyton, come here. Can I tell you that that was so, so good.
thank you.
our next big performance is in three weeks.
but if you promise me that you're going to work extra, extra, super, super, hard, we'd love to have you.
I'll come every single day. - All day, every day.
well, it is a ballet school, not a childcare facility.
and when we make a commitment to a student, we ask that the parents make a commitment to the school.
can you do that?
well, I think you can make a little exception for me.
and why is that? - You don't know who I am?
no.
I'm Joe Kingman, baby! The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.
number one on that field and number one in your pretty little heart.
the King of the Gridiron.
Never-Say-No Joe?
no? Nothing?
odd.
well, don't you know who I am? - No.
I'm Monique Vasquez, the lady with the ballet school, the one that doesn't accept any new students full-time unless she knows for a fact that the parents are going to help out.
that's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever. Let's go.
who doesn't know who Joe Kingman is?
she must be living under a rock.
Raef will take it this time. - He shoots! Come on!
got it. - Yeah!
I didn't see what happened to Paul Pierce.
we'll be right back - after a word from our... - Let's go, Paul!
I can't believe they came from 10 down.
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.
don't look at me like that. Use a napkin.
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike. Mean old Daddy.
let's get Webber.
Webber, you want a soda?
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
that's refreshing. - Good one.
what's up, Joe?
I don't know, Coop. What do you think? That's a $40, 000 couch.
I asked you to be careful!
which bathroom should I use? - The one off the trophy room.
come on, Pierce!
paul Pierce comes down with the board.
the man's a beast. You saw that, Joe. You saw that.
that's why the Celtics are my team for life.
celtics got this one locked up.
hold on, hold on...
wait a second. Wait a minute. Little bit more.
stop growling. Hold on. One, two, three.
what did I do?
let's go, Paul Pierce. Time to come through.
okay, here we go, baby. Here we go. - Three seconds left.
welcome to the Magical World of Ponies.
what happened?
get it back! Get it back! Get the game back!
get the mechanicals!
the mechanicals. The mechanicals, Joe!
what are you doing? - I'm trying! I'm trying!
it's right there. See?
unbelievable!
we missed it!
you gotta celebrate. - Peyton.
what did I do?
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.
wait. Where are you going?
you don't have to leave. Where are you guys going?
I got to get home to... - Where?
nothing.
what did I tell you about touching the remote?
bath. Bed. Now.
just got to add a little bit of bubble bath.
not too much. That's good.
perfect.
this could take a while.
but what really sets this future Hall of Famer apart...
passion for the game.
spike, you know the rule, no barking when I'm on TV!
spike!
spike?
what happened?
spike.
Peyton?
Peyton! Peyton!
Peyton!
I'm not going to yell.
we're going to have a very calm
and rational discussion about all...
you Bedazzled my football.
you guys comfortable? My pillow.
king on the couch!
this is ridiculous.
never say...
No! No!
I have to warm up.
I have to practice.
I have a playoff game this weekend.
do you... Do you know what that means?
my guess is that it means you have a playoff game this weekend.
my dog, my bed, my car, my TV, my stereo...
is nothing sacrificed?
my towel! My towel.
this is all mine! It's all me!
it's all mine! This is all me! This is my towel.
Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert, along with Boomer Esiason.
we're here in the Mile High City where Denver hosts Boston in the first round of the playoffs.
in what should be a tremendous showdown.
we have a rematch of last year's Conference Final in which Denver narrowly escaped with a 34-30 victory.
he has the tight end om screen, he side-arms it.
the catch made by Cooper.
Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.
and now, directing traffic...
nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!
and he's bounced out of bounds!
Yeah! I did it again!
Oh, our boy looks great today.
he's going to look even greater lounging poolside at the new Blake resort.
let's just see how many Fanny's kiddie meals he sells first.
Fanny.
do you work at Fanny's Burgers?
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.
my mom says...
I mean, my dad says your chili cheese fries rock.
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on! Kick it!
Kingman out of the gun, takes a look.
he has Sanders wide open. He's not going that way.
Marv, I've never seen a quarterback who doesn't trust his wide receivers with a game on the line like this.
Touchdown! It's all over!
Boston has defeated Denver.
all on the legs of Joe Kingman,
Boston advances to next week's divisional playoffs for the second year in a row.
now, will this be the year the King takes them all the way?
Peyton, are you okay? Why are you still here?
I guess Joe's running a little bit late from practice.
what, two hours late? That's unacceptable.
come on, sweetie. Let's go.
Hey, King.
no, I'm the king. You're the king.
don't do it, Elvis! Don't jump.
Mr. Kingman?
Oh, no. Peyton.
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.
Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about... - You know what?
why don't you just call me Joe?
stop it. Stop it.
Mr. Kingman, I informed you from the start that we are a ballet school, not a daycare center.
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.
I'm glad you told me. Now I know. Ballet school, not a daycare facility.
sure, let me hook you up for your time, though.
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag. It's in my wallet, around the corner.
I just knew you were one of those parents.
one of what parents?
the kind who thinks that his life is more important than anybody else's.
look, lady. I don't know what kind of parent I am.
all I know is I have an entire team...
scratch that, an entire city depending on me.
Yeah, you also have a daughter depending on you not to only take care of her, but to care about her. Okay?
listen, I care about Peyton. - Then prove it!
I got it. - Hey, sweetie!
your father here was telling me how excited he is to finally fulfill the commitment he made to support the school.
and guess what? I've got the perfect job for him.
cool.
no, no, no. Absolutely not. You're completely insane.
you're a freakishly large man and you're telling me you're incapable of playing a tree? Come on.
no, what I'm telling you is I am a serious athlete.
not a ballerina.
you do me a favor, mamita? Can you please hold this for me?
thank you so much.
trust me, no one is ever going to confuse you with a ballerina, okay?
and now, I need you to be an enchanted tree...
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree. I'm a quarterback!
I'm the only one that talks.
up!
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no... Please, come over here.
wasn't so bad.
we're just warming up, so come on.
Hey, so what were you saying about ballet not being a real sport?
hmm?
it wasn't... It wasn't so bad.
you see, ballerinas can leap as high as you can, but when they go down, they go down in pli?
and they hold and hold.
and then they go en pointe for hours and hours.
so, if ballet were easy, they'd call it football.
Yeah. Right.
Yeah, right.
listen, Mr. Kingman, your daughter has all the makings to be a professional dancer.
she has passion, talent, discipline.
I guess she inherited more than just your charm.
you see?
let's try that one again.
where were you last night? You missed a great fight.
Hey, man, you look like you were in a fight.
I was doing some stuff.
well, you could've called. You never call anymore.
dude, stop being such a chick.
never thought someone so little could be so much work, huh?
you don't know the half of it.
listen, I finally got to a phone. I want you to tell me everything.
I don't know where to start.
how about those pictures you promised me?
e- mail me right now.
I have to see you.
okay, hold on.
I just sent them.
you're breaking up. I love you.
wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...
I love you, too.
we need to talk. Follow me.
I need my bed back.
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!
love it. I love this room. This is awesome.
it's beautiful.
Thanks, Joe. - You're welcome.
look, P, you know the whole "playbook for the house" thing?
no more buttonhooks in the kitchen.
right. No more buttonhooks.
you see, the quarterback is supposed to know the playbook better than anybody.
but you and I, you've been playing kid your entire life.
I just joined the dad team, and I'm still learning all these plays.
no kidding.
all right.
listen, sometimes a quarterback has got to think on his feet and call an audible, okay? And...
here, this.
when the linebackers are creeping up to blitz
and all of a sudden you've got to call an audible to change the play, and you go around and you score!
he scores.
all right, it's kind of like, just like in life.
sometimes things get thrown at you unexpectedly.
then you got to call an audible.
you got to learn on the go.
just like us. Okay? - Okay.
number one on the field, and number one in your heart.
now, number one on your toothbrush. - That's funny.
my teeth are really white.
that's ridiculous.
no, that's not. That's awesome.
Joe? - Yeah?
what's the best thing that's ever happened to you?
well, I...
you have one incoming message.
hold that question, all right?
this is the King. Do your thing.
Hey, baby, it's Tatianna. I'm in Boston. I be there 6: 00.
Tatianna!
Tatianna's coming at 6: 00. I got plenty of time! It's 5: 45!
who's Tatianna?
I got 15 minutes.
who's Tatianna? - 5: 45. 5: 45. 5: 45.
listen, she's a friend. I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.
take all this, take it down, and... Hide it in your room.
and you go, too.
and you play hide-and-seek with that, and just make sure they're all gone.
is Tatianna your girlfriend?
do you mind?
no, no, no, no, maybe, yes.
Hi, you must be Melanie. Joe has told me so much about you!
I'm Tatianna. What are you? - Peyton. Joe's daughter.
Joe's daughter?
Mmm-hmm.
how old are you anyway, four? - How old are you, 40?
I'm 21. - Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?
Joe!
bonsoir, Tatianna. Baby, welcome back!
I know. - I see you've already met...
Peyton.
Peyton, yes. I don't know what she's told you.
cause she has such a wild imagination.
either way, we have a lot to discuss over dinner.
where are we eating?
you are going to eat over at the Jensens', across the hall.
all right, all right. All right, all right.
never say no.
well, this is Kingman's defining moment, Marv.
if they win, they guarantee themselves a spot in the playoffs.
everybody get on the King's back and I'm going to lead you to the promised land.
all right? On one, on one. Ready? - Break!
go deep. Watch your left!
let's go!
pick him up. Pick him up.
Sanders. Sanders.
go wide!
hut-hut!
Hut!
all right, here's Kingman. Drops back in the pocket.
he's got Sanders wide open in the end zone.
Kingman is on the run. He's inside the five.
he stiff-arms. It's the Kingman swing.
and he is in! Touchdown, Rebels. They've won it.
what a tremendous play by Kingman, Marv.
but I have to wonder, yesterday he was...
the King does it again!
go Joe! - Go Joe!
never say no! - Never say no!
Yeah!
WZPZ FM.
Hey, Boston. Happy New Year. And a special shout out to our Rebels.
don't party too hard, boys.
you're going to need all your strength to bring home that championship.
enjoy your drink. - To us.
hope it's okay.
I'm telling you guys, these aren't the normal onion rings.
they got garlic and mint leaves. I mean, like, beluga caviar.
Hey, Coop. Coop, check it out.
see the hottie? 12 o'clock, tan dress? - Oh, yeah.
I think she said you have a killer smile, bro.
I do.
you should go talk to her.
you think so? - I know so. Come on.
get in there. Get in there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, swamp mouth.
use some of this. Chicks dig it.
Webber, you got a pen? - Why?
because you might want to take some notes.
what's up?
Webber!
I told you, they bumped up shoot. I have to catch last flight to Paris.
but Tatianna will miss you.
the King doesn't want his queen to miss him too much.
so I got you a little something special.
close your eyes. - Okay.
Tatianna, Tatianna. Which one? Which one?
no peeking.
dreams are on Joe tonight, honey.
happy New Year.
Chanel? - Or Chanel.
whoa, Sanders. Where you going?
just past your bedtime?
Yeah, well, you know, it's New Year's Eve.
want to go home, hug the wife, kiss the kids.
all right, thanks for coming. Happy New Year.
all right, Happy New Year. - All right, see you at practice.
all right, see you.
all right, Joe. Come on, it's real funny.
now, just give me back the wallet, all right?
I'm looking to confiscate Sanders' man card, but his wife, Maria, has already done it.
Yes, really... - Come on. Get a life, Sanders.
Oh, you call this "life"? That ain't life, Joe.
whatever. - He's mad. That was funny, man.
who's ready to party? - I am.
party!
where can I get a man card?
Why? The night is still young! - We can walk Spike.
play the guitars, Joe. Come on. - We were just bonding.
I love that idea. - We're starting to jell.
call me. - Joe...
we were doing so good.
Hey, Spike. There's my boy. Haven't seen you all night.
do you know who the greatest quarterback of all time is?
just checking. Let's go! Huddle up!
can you feel it? Can you smell it? Do you believe it?
Z- slant Mississippi! On three. Ready? Break! Hut! Hut! Hut!
come on, Spike. We need a football biscuit.
Oh, that's a good one. Oh, this is a good one.
Kingman drops back, he's... Oh, defenders are coming around.
post pattern, Spike. Post pattern.
he throws.
Touchdown! They're going crazy.
crazy.
Gracias, Rosa. Enjoy your vacation.
what do you want to do, Spike? What do you want to do today?
it's a new year.
you want to play football? You want to go for a walk?
you want to watch the new ESPN special profile on Joe Kingman?
I know you do. Me, too. Watch. Watch. Here we go.
Attaboy.
blessed with crazy strength and ridiculous agility...
ridiculous.
...Joe Kingman could have succeeded on talent alone.
but what really sets this future hall-of-famer apart is his passion for the game.
and no one sums it up better than Joe himself.
wait a minute, that's not what I said. - Listen, listen.
what I said was this. Life... - Life...
...holds many pleasures for me. ... holds many pleasures for me.
but... - But...
...nothing... ... nothing...
...nothing beats the thrill... ... nothing beats the thrill...
...of playing on that field... ... of playing on that field...
...every Sunday. ... every Sunday.
football is my life. - Football is my life.
beyond the field... - Beyond the field...
...nothing else matters. ... nothing else matters. Watch this.
nothing.
if nothing else really matters, why does that championship ring elude Kingman?
some of the experts say it's because he's too selfish.
I mean, think about it...
how does that sound, Stuey?
Joe, you're a 30-something now, not a 20-something.
the clock is ticking, Joe. Ticking on your career.
blah, blah, blah...
you come talk to me when you have your own action figure, Stuey.
yeah? Pardon me, Mr. Kingman.
I have a visitor here at reception.
a Peyton Kelly, sir. - I don't know any Peytons.
a young lady.
is she cute? - Oh, exceedingly so, sir.
well, what are you waiting for, Larry? Send her up.
he never says "no."
I am the king. Thank you very much.
look out.
hello.
goodbye. Hey!
look, kid, I don't do Girl Scout cookies, okay?
you don't get abs like these eating Peanut Butter Patties, you know?
go ahead, hit me. Come on! Give it a shot. Come on.
it's ridiculous, isn't it?
Bye-bye.
it's ridiculous.
I don't know what it is you're selling. Look what I have, here's a hundo.
I don't want any money. I want...
I know. I know what you want. I get it. It's what the world wants.
an autograph of Joe Kingman. They all want it, eight to 80.
you'll probably go sell it, but I'm going to give it to you for free.
because I'm Joe Kingman, humanitarian.
happy New Year. I'll be right back.
you have a bulldog. Come here, boy.
you're so cute.
easy, easy. He's a very vicious attack dog.
Yeah. He's going to lick me to death.
listen, you just can't come walking into strangers' homes like this.
there are a lot of weirdos out there in the world.
didn't your mom ever teach you that? - Yeah.
well, where is she? - On an airplane.
on an airplane? Well, who are you here with?
my father.
well, you better go get him, because I'm sure he's looking for you.
he's not looking for me. - How do you know?
because he's looking at me.
what?
Hi, we've never met before. You were married to my mom, Sara.
Sara Kelly?
my name is Peyton. I'm your daughter.
no. No. Nope. No!
no. Time out. Sara and I never had a kid.
she wrote you a note. - Wrote me a note.
Joe, I know this is a big surprise, but Peyton is your daughter.
I need you to watch her for a month. It's an emergency.
I'll explain everything when I get back. Sara.
you sure got a lot of pictures of yourself in here.
you expect me to believe you're my kid, based on this?
anybody could have written this. - Oh, yeah.
I've also got this. It's my birth certificate.
birth certificate?
your name is on it. - My name is...
my name?
awesome!
ready? Break!
my name's not on this.
joseph Kingman.
Hut! Hut! Hut!
we've got a situation. - Touchdown!
fix it.
don't you think you should have told me about this?
I didn't know. - You didn't know you had an ex-wife?
that was a long time ago. We were crazy in love, but too young.
didn't even last longer than a year, and we never had a baby.
okay, but for argument's sake, is there the teeniest, tiniest possibility that this child could be yours?
think hard.
I don't know.
we got the separation, the divorce was final, she came by to pick up a few of her things and then we...
we...
is anyone else hungry?
hungry? - Joe...
when did this, "We... We... Is anyone else hungry" happen?
about eight, nine years ago.
how old are you, kid? - Eight.
congratulations, Joe.
this isn't happening to me.
muffin, just talk to your Auntie Stella.
hmm?
it says here that your mom is not coming back for a month.
she's on her way to Africa.
what kind of a selfish, self-centered person dumps their kid...
she's on a water sanitation project bringing fresh drinking water to the drought-ravaged children of the Sudan.
if I had a dime for every time I heard that one.
so on her way to save the world, your mom just suddenly decided to leave you here?
I begged her. I said, "Well, why don't I stay with my father?
and she said, "Well, baby, he doesn't know about you yet. " And I said...
I get it. I get it. So, who else can you stay with?
I got it. I got it. I'm a genius.
Sara has a sister.
goombah, Grip, Grime... Carmen!
Karen. - Karen. What about her?
she's...
she's dead.
Oh, that's convenient.
what?
how do we get in touch with your mom?
her cell won't work in Kassala. - Email?
they don't have Internet there.
how did you get here again?
we flew to Boston together, and then she put me in a car.
and the car just magically dropped you off at some man's house?
not some man. My father. - So you say.
want a paternity test? - Yes. That's a great idea.
let's do that. No problem.
I don't like needles. So if they don't take blood, no problem.
not in the middle of negotiating our Fanny's deal, it's not.
these things never stay quiet, trust me.
if she does turn out to be yours, you'll look like a guy who had a kid and ditched her and you can kiss your mega-bucks goodbye.
Stella. - Hmm.
we don't even look alike.
Oh, no. Not at all.
thanks a lot for the heads up, Larry. - Hey, I told you she was cute.
I'm late.
let's go. No huddle.
no back seat. - So what? Get in the car.
if you get in an accident, the air bag will hurt me.
Oh, come on, I don't have time for the safety lesson, please!
come here.
so late.
I've got four weeks to make up for eight years, so let's get started, shall we?
I'm going to ask you some questions and you're going to give me some answers, okay?
now, for example, if you asked me what my favorite thing to do was, I would say ballet.
so what's your favorite thing to do?
that's easy. Play football.
football.
come on!
if you could only save one thing in a fire, what would it be?
my Heisman.
no, wait... I know.
my limited edition Joe Kingman sneakers.
come on, horseradish. No more questions.
just one more question.
what's the best thing that's ever happened to you?
listen, I got a question for you.
why didn't your mom just bring you here herself?
want a cookie?
no, I don't want a cookie. Stop trying to change the subject.
but you said you were hungry.
and I made them special for you. - Fine, fine.
now, about your mom. - I told you, it was last-minute.
I just can't believe that the Sara I knew would just let her daughter show up at my doorstep alone.
I know what happened.
you do? - Yeah.
she's gained a lot of weight. - No.
what's she pushing now? About 180?
deuce?
let's go.
what do you think, you're some roaming free safety or something?
this is "cover-two," little lady, so stay close.
are you okay?
do I sound okay? What did you put in those cookies?
milk, flour, eggs and cinnamon... - Cinnamon!
cinnamon? I'm allergic to cinnamon.
Oh, I'm sorry. - All you got to say is, "I'm sorry"?
I sound like this, "I'm sorry"? Cinnamon!
I'm allergic to nuts.
Joe. Joe, don't forget I got that publicity shoot set up for you today.
you have to be there this time. - I'll be there.
what do you think, I'm stupid or something?
stop touching me.
stop eating so much.
you're late, Joe. That's a $500 fine. - Start a tab.
Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
king's here, Danville. I got it. King's here.
get a submarine sandwich and a diet soda.
all right, let's go. Sixty-six seam, slot left on three, on three. Ready?
suffering succotash, Sylvester, something seems to be wrong with your mouth.
I said sixty-six, slot seam left on three. On three. Ready?
Hey, Joe. Looks like you got a rogue fan.
I'm not a fan. I'm Joe's daughter. - What's everybody staring at?
I didn't know Joe had a kid.
yo, I don't think Joe knew Joe had a kid.
stay here. - Yes, sir.
hat.
give me this!
here's what you got to read right there. You all set?
here we go. And three, two, one... Go!
Boston Rebels! Experience the heat!
Boston Rebels! Catch the magic.
Boston Rebels! Feel the... Wait a minute. Who writes this?
Hey, let's get Joe. He won't be expecting it.
we'll put ice in his bath.
coop, look. Look real close.
Joe is in an ice bath.
well, we'll put colder ice in it. - Glove.
Webber, think about this.
big surprise, eh, Kingman?
more like a safety blitz.
Yeah, well, you should be happy.
I remember how happy I was when my kids were born.
Yeah, but you knew they were coming.
Yeah, well, either way, she's here now.
what's your name, sweetheart?
Peyton. - Peyton, that's cute.
Hi, Peyton. - Hi.
Oh, that's cool. Like... Like, Peyton Manning?
no, dude. It's like Walter Payton, right?
no. Peyton Rous.
who's that? - He won the Nobel Prize.
for what team?
in medicine.
he's not even a football player. That's stupid.
"stupid" is a mean word.
no, it isn't. - Yes, it is.
isn't. - Is!
quiet. Both of you.
step away from my pants.
awkward.
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
see, those are Monroe's very special underwear.
you see, he needs to wear them every game, - or he thinks we won't win. - Oh.
Hey, I'm on SportsCenter again.
I'm hungry.
please don't touch anything. Stand right here.
tonight's Tuesday. We're going to carbo-load.
Twenty-twenty-sixty ratio.
what?
Hey, do you have any Jell-O? I want some Jell-O.
like I said, please don't touch. Fingerprints. I don't like fingerprints.
stand right here, don't do anything.
I'm not giving you 28 grams of empty carbohydrates.
we do not do simple sugars in this house.
but I'm a kid and kids love sugar. I mean, the simpler the better.
well, my dad never let me have sugar.
Oh, is that why you never smile?
listen, you better eat your food before it gets cold.
but it's as big as a mountain.
listen, if you're going to make the pros, you have to get your appetite up.
let's go. Eat.
you got a little...
a little something right here. - What?
I got what?
I'm going to go and wash the dishes.
you can eat.
and finish eating.
I don't have a guest room because I don't like guests.
but you can sleep here.
what's this? - That is a universal remote.
it controls the world. And you don't need to touch it.
what's the "romance" button for?
the romance button is for a little Valentine's Day magic.
turn... Turn this off. Turn it off. Turn it off.
turn it off. Press the button. Turn it off.
stop touching things.
aren't you going to tell me a bedtime story?
bedtime story... Bedtime story.
Yeah.
the Big Bad Wolf blew down the Grammy's house and ate the Goldilocks and then there was something about the porridge.
the end.
good night.
I mean a real bedtime story, Joe.
a bedtime story is supposed to make you feel peaceful.
I'll show you.
lean back, relax, and listen to the story.
fine. Fine. I'm going to listen to this one time, then that's it.
then you go to sleep. Do you understand me?
once upon a time there was a princess and she had a lot of beautiful dresses.
she had a pink dress, a red dress, a blue dress, a green dress, a purple dress, - an orange dress, a yellow dress... - I get it. I get it. I get it.
a lot of dresses, a lot of colors. So what?
so each dress had a secret power.
the pink dress, which had pink sparkles all over it, could make her fly.
and the blue dress, which had blue sparkles all over it, could make her tiny.
and the green dress, which had green sparkles all over it, could make her sleep.
Hey, baby.
why didn't you answer me when I called?
I was starting to get worried.
I'm sorry. I forgot I had my phone turned off from the flight.
well, I'm just happy that you got there safely. So, how's it going?
great. Well, the food's not so hot, but my room is huge.
well, that's very cool, but how's the ballet?
I mean, is it as good as they promised?
too soon to tell.
Hey, listen, sweetie, it's almost time for my flight to take off, but I will call you as soon as I can, okay?
I miss you so much already.
e- mail me lots of pictures. And Peyton, I love you.
I love you, too. Bye.
is there a ballet school close by?
spike?
why is my dog in a dress with pink nail polish?
he's learning Swan Lake.
do you know how to fix a ballerina bun?
do I look like I know how to fix a ballerina bun?
my mom says we're not supposed to pop our knuckles.
well, your mom didn't sleep on a hard sofa instead of her specially designed $ 10, 000 orthopedic bed made by Dr. Johan Gustavo, of Switzerland.
what's... What's with the Beethoven? - It's Tchaikovsky.
do you listen to this every morning? - No.
sometimes I listen to Bach, or Rachmaninoff...
do you have an iPod?
because I'm going to buy you one. Immediately. Right now.
I'm going to buy you an iPod.
until then...
what is this?
my Bedazzler. Doesn't Camille look pretty?
a Bedazzler?
and that's why I use tuna for protein and flavor.
gross. - Little liquid chickens.
Yeah, that's my favorite.
Joe's juice.
okay. That's enough.
I'm gonna need you to drink up.
you'll be running the 40 in under 4. 5 in no time.
that smells worse than school food.
you know, speaking of school, why aren't you in it?
I'm on break. - In January? No you're not.
Yes, I am. I go to a magnet school, so I have January off.
Really? Well, guess what? I'm not on break.
as a matter of fact, I'm on the opposite of break.
so I'm gonna need you to come over here, put some hustle in it, and drink your breakfast.
Peyton, stop messing around. - What?
Peyton!
No!
nice.
that's real nice.
you know what a playbook is? - I'm guessing it's a book with plays?
Oh, I get it. The Xs are for kisses and the Os for hugs.
wrong! The X's mean "stay out of these areas of the house.
the O's mean "open access.
for example, you want to go to the kitchen, straight buttonhook.
but now you go to the kitchen, big X.
off limits. No access.
can't go there, because you made a mess in the kitchen.
do you understand?
no trick plays, no flea-flickers. Got it?
got it. No flea-flickers.
this is your game plan. Learn it. Live it. Love it.
that's it, boys. Practice is over.
pick a nanny, Joe.
I'll take the one at... - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
don't you think you should ask some questions first?
I've got great instincts.
the one on the end, Stella.
Edna.
the other end, Stella.
blondie, you're up.
Oh, no. No.
the King picked me!
we are going to be just like sisters!
Oh, my goodness.
you start tomorrow.
Hey. You're going to the opening tonight, right?
it's my restaurant.
well, what are you going to do with her?
I don't know.
Hi. Hello.
welcome, Mr. Kingman.
the Maloofs! - About time, there, Joe.
you made it. Have fun.
Yeah. - Enjoy yourself.
Hey, Joe. - Hey, man.
how you doing? - Hey.
Jo Jo! - Hey, nice to see you.
Hey, everything's on Joe tonight.
and that's exactly what I said. I told them.
I said, "Listen, I'm the greatest."
the purple or the yellow?
that's what I was thinking, too.
I'll be back.
water the lawn. Water the lawn.
Hey, great night, Mr. Kingman.
indeed it was, Jay. Indeed it was.
Hey, Joe! This way!
number one on the field and number one in your heart.
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
Yes, I do.
when it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
what can make me feel this way
my girl
Joe?
my girl
talking about my girl
my girl... Peyton!
Joe?
Joe. Joe, where are you?
there you are. Joe, I thought you forgot about me.
Peyton! Peyton! Peyton!
Hey, Joe, is that your daughter? - Peyton!
Hey, Joe, you forget something?
father of the year!
yesterday, Fanny's Burgers agreed to hand out your action figure with every order of fries.
but do you think they're going to want a spokesman who forgot his child in a bar?
my mom says that Fanny's makes kids fat and gives them gas.
well, your daddy's agent says Fanny's makes him fat with cash.
now, I have to put together a press conference, do some cleanup.
I'm the janitor, Joe's the mop, and Peyton's the mess.
what?
something funny, Larry? - Just a little throat tickle, sir.
well, get it fixed.
right here. Chop-chop.
you got a station wagon, Stella?
no, you did.
say "bye-bye" to being the Big Bad Dad of Boston.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
you want me to sign that?
Peyton, sweetie, be a good girl and cooperate with your daddy and Auntie Stella will get you a nice new BlackBerry with a Bluetooth.
and an upgrade on your next international flight.
I'm eight.
listen, Bratty McPain-in-the-Butt, you will do whatever it takes to help your father.
I'll pay for the therapy.
listen, Peyton, what Stella's trying to say here is this right now is crunch time.
so, if something's bothering you, then all you got to do...
let's keep it bottled up until after the playoffs.
fine.
on one condition.
no nanny.
no way.
let's go. Come on. - I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.
everything's all...
dizzy? - I think it might be from that funny yellow soft drink Joe gave me last night.
what was it called again?
margarita?
you wouldn't. - You wouldn't.
try me.
good morning, Joe. I'm ready to start!
Hey, Cindy!
you're fired.
Bye.
Joe! Joe!
Hey, Joe, how can you remember the plays when you can't remember you have a daughter?
Joe, what is an 8-year-old girl doing in a nightclub at 3: 00 in the morning?
thank you. Thank you guys so much for coming out.
ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming.
great questions, by the way. Thank you.
as you all know by now, I've recently learned I'm a father.
and clearly, I'm still getting the hang of things.
that's not an excuse, Joe.
but you better believe that Peyton's nightclub evenings are behind her.
because from now on, we're both going to be going to sleep early, right?
now, who's number one on the field and number one in your heart?
let's go.
can I say something, please?
no. Let's go.
Hi, everybody, I'm Peyton, the one who'll be going to bed early from now on.
my dad didn't have much of a heads-up on this whole father thing and he is still getting the hang of things.
but it's like everything else in his life.
he never says "no.
I mean, he's teaching me that you can do anything if you've got motivation and determination.
and the place where that starts is right here, in the heart.
you're the world's greatest father.
that was good.
that was really good. - It's going to cost you.
...two, three, four, grand pli?.
there you go, there you go.
and...
come on, this isn't a sport.
football. Football's a sport.
excuse me. Hi. Can I help you?
hello. This is Peyton.
Hi. - And she's here for this.
so, I guess I'll be back in a couple of hours. Bye.
well, class started 15 minutes ago, and we don't accept students without an audition and that happened last month, so I'm really sorry.
I'm sure maybe we can work something out?
money's no object, as you probably know.
okay, the thing is that this is a professional school, and...
that's very nice. - Thank you.
go change, go on, go change.
let me see how she does today. Okay?
all right.
maybe I'll... I'll try and... We'll get somebody...
the moms sit over there.
excuse me. Thank you.
and one, two, three, very long...
come on, come on.
and one, two, three, four.
open up, like a princess, chin up.
thank you.
beautiful class, everybody. Beautiful.
Peyton, come here. Can I tell you that that was so, so good.
thank you.
our next big performance is in three weeks.
but if you promise me that you're going to work extra, extra, super, super, hard, we'd love to have you.
I'll come every single day. - All day, every day.
well, it is a ballet school, not a childcare facility.
and when we make a commitment to a student, we ask that the parents make a commitment to the school.
can you do that?
well, I think you can make a little exception for me.
and why is that? - You don't know who I am?
no.
I'm Joe Kingman, baby! The quarterback of the Boston Rebels.
number one on that field and number one in your pretty little heart.
the King of the Gridiron.
Never-Say-No Joe?
no? Nothing?
odd.
well, don't you know who I am? - No.
I'm Monique Vasquez, the lady with the ballet school, the one that doesn't accept any new students full-time unless she knows for a fact that the parents are going to help out.
that's fine. Fine. I promise. Whatever. Let's go.
who doesn't know who Joe Kingman is?
she must be living under a rock.
Raef will take it this time. - He shoots! Come on!
got it. - Yeah!
I didn't see what happened to Paul Pierce.
we'll be right back - after a word from our... - Let's go, Paul!
I can't believe they came from 10 down.
Hey, keep this clean. Use the napkins.
don't look at me like that. Use a napkin.
Yeah, you tell him. You tell him, Spike. Mean old Daddy.
let's get Webber.
Webber, you want a soda?
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
that's refreshing. - Good one.
what's up, Joe?
I don't know, Coop. What do you think? That's a $40, 000 couch.
I asked you to be careful!
which bathroom should I use? - The one off the trophy room.
come on, Pierce!
paul Pierce comes down with the board.
the man's a beast. You saw that, Joe. You saw that.
that's why the Celtics are my team for life.
celtics got this one locked up.
hold on, hold on...
wait a second. Wait a minute. Little bit more.
stop growling. Hold on. One, two, three.
what did I do?
let's go, Paul Pierce. Time to come through.
okay, here we go, baby. Here we go. - Three seconds left.
welcome to the Magical World of Ponies.
what happened?
get it back! Get it back! Get the game back!
get the mechanicals!
the mechanicals. The mechanicals, Joe!
what are you doing? - I'm trying! I'm trying!
it's right there. See?
unbelievable!
we missed it!
you gotta celebrate. - Peyton.
what did I do?
Thanks, Joe. Let's go, guys.
wait. Where are you going?
you don't have to leave. Where are you guys going?
I got to get home to... - Where?
nothing.
what did I tell you about touching the remote?
bath. Bed. Now.
just got to add a little bit of bubble bath.
not too much. That's good.
perfect.
this could take a while.
but what really sets this future Hall of Famer apart...
passion for the game.
spike, you know the rule, no barking when I'm on TV!
spike!
spike?
what happened?
spike.
Peyton?
Peyton! Peyton!
Peyton!
I'm not going to yell.
we're going to have a very calm
and rational discussion about all...
you Bedazzled my football.
you guys comfortable? My pillow.
king on the couch!
this is ridiculous.
never say...
No! No!
I have to warm up.
I have to practice.
I have a playoff game this weekend.
do you... Do you know what that means?
my guess is that it means you have a playoff game this weekend.
my dog, my bed, my car, my TV, my stereo...
is nothing sacred?
my towel! My towel.
this is all mine! It's all me!
it's all mine! This is all me! This is my towel.
Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert, along with Boomer Esiason.
we're here in the Mile High City where Denver hosts Boston in the first round of the playoffs.
in what should be a tremendous showdown.
we have a rematch of last year's Conference Final in which Denver narrowly escaped with a 34-30 victory.
he has the tight end screen, he side-arms it.
the catch made by Cooper.
Cooper on the run, picks up a blocker.
and now, directing traffic...
nice cut. Cooper down the sideline!
and he's bounced out of bounds!
Yeah! I did it again!
Oh, our boy looks great today.
he's going to look even greater lounging poolside at the new Blake resort.
let's just see how many Fanny's kiddie meals he sells first.
Fanny.
do you work at Fanny's Burgers?
I own Fanny's Burgers, honey.
my mom says...
I mean, my dad says your chili cheese fries rock.
Yeah, they do! They rock. Come on! Kick it!
Kingman out of the gun, takes a look.
he has Sanders wide open. He's not going that way.
Marv, I've never seen a quarterback who doesn't trust his wide receivers with a game on the line like this.
Touchdown! It's all over!
Boston has defeated Denver.
all on the legs of Joe Kingman,
Boston advances to next week's divisional playoffs for the second year in a row.
now, will this be the year the King takes them all the way?
Peyton, are you okay? Why are you still here?
I guess Joe's running a little bit late from practice.
what, two hours late? That's unacceptable.
come on, sweetie. Let's go.
Hey, King.
no, I'm the king. You're the king.
don't do it, Elvis! Don't jump.
Mr. Kingman?
Oh, no. Peyton.
Yeah, I guess practice ran a little longer than expected. Thanks, Bo.
Mr. Kingman, we need to talk about... - You know what?
why don't you just call me Joe?
stop it. Stop it.
Mr. Kingman, I informed you from the start that we are a ballet school, not a daycare center.
Yeah! I got that. Mental note.
I'm glad you told me. Now I know. Ballet school, not a daycare facility.
sure, let me hook you up for your time, though.
Peyton, go grab a hundo out of my bag. It's in my wallet, around the corner.
I just knew you were one of those parents.
one of what parents?
the kind who thinks that his life is more important than anybody else's.
look, lady. I don't know what kind of parent I am.
all I know is I have an entire team...
scratch that, an entire city depending on me.
Yeah, you also have a daughter depending on you not to only take care of her, but to care about her. Okay?
listen, I care about Peyton. - Then prove it!
I got it. - Hey, sweetie!
your father here was telling me how excited he is to finally fulfill the commitment he made to support the school.
and guess what? I've got the perfect job for him.
cool.
no, no, no. Absolutely not. You're completely insane.
you're a freakishly large man and you're telling me you're incapable of playing a tree? Come on.
no, what I'm telling you is I am a serious athlete.
not a ballerina.
you do me a favor, mamita? Can you please hold this for me?
thank you so much.
trust me, no one is ever going to confuse you with a ballerina, okay?
and now, I need you to be an enchanted tree...
I'm not going to be an enchanted tree. I'm a quarterback!
I'm the only one that talks.
up!
...around and... Oh, my God, no, no... Please, come over here.
wasn't so bad.
we're just warming up, so come on.
Hey, so what were you saying about ballet not being a real sport?
hmm?
it wasn't... It wasn't so bad.
you see, ballerinas can leap as high as you can, but when they go down, they go down in pli?
and they hold and hold.
and then they go en pointe for hours and hours.
so, if ballet were easy, they'd call it football.
Yeah. Right.
Yeah, right.
listen, Mr. Kingman, your daughter has all the makings to be a professional dancer.
she has passion, talent, discipline.
I guess she inherited more than just your charm.
you see?
let's try that one again.
where were you last night? You missed a great fight.
Hey, man, you look like you were in a fight.
I was doing some stuff.
well, you could've called. You never call anymore.
dude, stop being such a chick.
never thought someone so little could be so much work, huh?
you don't know the half of it.
listen, I finally got to a phone. I want you to tell me everything.
I don't know where to start.
how about those pictures you promised me?
e- mail me right now.
I have to see you.
okay, hold on.
I just sent them.
you're breaking up. I love you.
wait, wait. No, no, Peyton! Honey...
I love you, too.
we need to talk. Follow me.
I need my bed back.
Wow! That is awesome! I love it!
love it. I love this room. This is awesome.
it's beautiful.
Thanks, Joe. - You're welcome.
look, P, you know the whole "playbook for the house" thing?
no more buttonhooks in the kitchen.
right. No more buttonhooks.
you see, the quarterback is supposed to know the playbook better than anybody.
but you and I, you've been playing kid your entire life.
I just joined the dad team, and I'm still learning all these plays.
no kidding.
all right.
listen, sometimes a quarterback has got to think on his feet and call an audible, okay? And...
here, this.
when the linebackers are creeping up to blitz
and all of a sudden you've got to call an audible to change the play, and you go around and you score!
he scores.
all right, it's kind of like, just like in life.
sometimes things get thrown at you unexpectedly.
then you got to call an audible.
you got to learn on the go.
just like us. Okay? - Okay.
number one on the field, and number one in your heart.
now, number one on your toothbrush. - That's funny.
my teeth are really white.
that's ridiculous.
no, that's not. That's awesome.
Joe? - Yeah?
what's the best thing that's ever happened to you?
well, I...
you have one incoming message.
hold that question, all right?
this is the King. Do your thing.
Hey, baby, it's Tatianna. I'm in Boston. I be there 6: 00.
Tatianna!
Tatianna's coming at 6: 00. I got plenty of time! It's 5: 45!
who's Tatianna?
I got 15 minutes.
who's Tatianna? - 5: 45. 5: 45. 5: 45.
listen, she's a friend. I'm gonna need you to clean up all this.
take all this, take it down, and... Hide it in your room.
and you go, too.
and you play hide-and-seek with that, and just make sure they're all gone.
is Tatianna your girlfriend?
do you mind?
no, no, no, no, maybe, yes.
Hi, you must be Melanie. Joe has told me so much about you!
I'm Tatianna. What are you? - Peyton. Joe's daughter.
Joe's daughter?
Mmm-hmm.
how old are you anyway, four? - How old are you, 40?
I'm 21. - Are you Joe's long-lost daughter, too?
Joe!
bonsoir, Tatianna. Baby, welcome back!
I know. - I see you've already met...
Peyton.
Peyton, yes. I don't know what she's told you.
cause she has such a wild imagination.
either way, we have a lot to discuss over dinner.
where are we eating?
you are going to eat over at the Jensens', across the hall.
...four brothers...
...genetically reborn in the sewers of New York.
named after the great Renaissance masters...
...and trained as ninjas.
they battled many creatures and foes before defeating their archenemy...
...the Shredder.
but now a greater evil is poised to destroy their very brotherhood.
an evil born 3000 years ago.
it was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl...
...led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose:
to conquer all the kingdoms of the world.
nothing could stand in their way...
...as they left a trail of destruction behind them.
in his quest, the warrior learned of a constellation...
...known as the Stars of Kikan.
every 3000 years, the stars would align...
...opening a portal to a world of unknown power.
he became immortal...
...but at a price.
his brotherhood was turned to stone.
and upon the portal's opening...
...13 monsters were released into our world.
the warrior king was left to eternally walk the Earth...
...unable to die or forget his horrible mistake.
and the monsters that were unleashed...
...continue to plague mankind to this very day.
monsters.
no.
we appreciate the generous donation...
...for the continued protection of your village.
after all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place.
mama! - Oh, she is dangerous.
there's monsters out there.
watch where you're going.
there's a log on the road, se? Or.
well, if you're not too busy, remove it.
who are you? Show yourself.
the ghost of the jungle. He punishes those who prey upon the weak.
he's coming.
I just remembered I left the stove on. My wife hates that.
coward. Get back here. - You're on your own, jefe.
show yourself. Do you realize who you're dealing with?
what is this...? What?
I am not afraid of a myth.
I'm not afraid of a ghost.
what are you?
it's a miracle.
the ghost of the jungle.
there. That's where I saw him.
thank you.
you'd better get home now.
do you know the ghost?
he wasn't always a ghost.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
it's a long way from the city to just drop in.
you came all the way down here to look for me?
actually, I was already here on business.
but then the local legend started sounding familiar...
...so I decided to snoop around.
what kind of business? - Ancient artifacts.
some tycoon with too much time on his hands...
...has his heart set on a collection of 3000-year-old statues.
well, you always did run with a strange crowd, April.
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd hasn't been the same without you.
things aren't looking so good back home.
how bad could it be?
Donnie's probably got everything under control.
sir? Sir. Sir.
did you turn the computer on? Have you plugged it in?
Yeah, that would help.
no, I'm not playing hard to get.
I'm telling you, sir, it's not that kind of phone line.
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie, your friendly IT tech support...
...Here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.
but Donnie's a genius. Why would he take a job like that?
at least he's keeping busy.
well, if he's doing that, who's keeping an eye on Mikey?
Mike's gotten into the entertainment business.
Yeah.
happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.
take it easy, little dudes. I bruise easily.
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green, dudes. Hey, that's...
he's a big hit.
all right. Let's hear it. What's Raph doing?
no one really knows. He just sleeps all day.
well, what's he do all night?
2802, 2802, burglary in progress at 55th and Broadway.
suspects considered armed and dangerous.
time to punch in.
good work, boys. That was easier than I thought it was gonna be.
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.
I love your work ethic, Tommy. It's an inspiration to us all.
what was that?
what's going on, guys?
what in the...?
looks like it's just you and me, shaky.
take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...
...much.
I love when they play hard to get.
the Nightwatcher.
he's doing our job for us again. - Tommy.
keep your hands to yourself. - Hey, who's tickling me?
your training period ended a year ago.
and Splinter says you don't write anymore.
splinter sent me down here to become a better leader.
I can't go back a failure.
besides, these people need me more than my brothers do.
if Master Splinter were here...
...he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?
I don't know. I just know something's missing.
your brothers need you, Leo.
they're lost without you.
why skate a halfpipe when you can skate a sewer pipe?
sewer's up, bra.
Hey.
Cowabunga.
dude. Going down.
Yeah.
here's Mikey.
guys?
anyone?
Hello?
whatever.
this place used to be fun.
and with rocketing interest rates, that's bad news for homeowners...
...as the real-estate market continues its downward spiral.
coming up, the vigilante known as Nightwatcher strikes again.
now, I can't say for sure, but he was definitely an alien.
I think it's a disgrace, taking the law into your own hands like that.
leave it to the police. - Up next...
I remember how that used to feel, busting up crime syndicates.
sure, they had a bunch of guns, but they weren't like these guns.
why do you do this to yourself, Mikey? Those glory days are over.
forget about them. Get on with your life. Concentrate on your work.
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.
well, look who woke up.
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher is some kind of hero.
beats sitting around doing nothing while dirtbags run free.
I would love to know what it is that you do that's so great.
we're contributing around here. All you do is sleep.
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right. You got me all figured out.
I know that your attitude has been a source of contention to this team.
you think fear is the best way to accomplish things.
first of all, this team you speak of doesn't exist anymore.
and second of all...
enough.
I think I made my point.
that doesn't prove anything.
why couldn't you send him away for training?
Donatello, this home has become like an empty shell.
each of your brothers has strengths and weaknesses.
you must learn to be strong when they are weak.
if you don't learn to recognize this...
...then all hope is lost for our family.
keep it coming.
Hey, careful.
those aren't souvenirs.
sorry about that, ma'am.
where are you, Casey?
come on. Come on, pick up.
don't do this to me again. Not now.
Casey can't come to the phone right now because we're hardly working.
this better be good.
Casey, I am standing on the dock with a priceless statue and no delivery truck.
so my question is, where are you? - April.
Hey, babe. I am so sorry. I set the alarm clock, but...
it's broken. The clock...
it's bad enough that you're out every night playing vigilante...
...but we've got a deadline to meet. - I'm sorry.
Oh, wait, babe, real quick. You left a message saying you found Leo.
I mean, is he there with you? - No.
I found him. He's not coming back.
but didn't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the Turtles?
look, Casey, we're gonna lose the biggest client we have...
...if you don't get down here.
all right. I'm on my way.
please tell me we're getting paid by the pound here.
is this place a museum or what?
you've never heard of Winterscorp? - That's what I'm telling you.
they're into everything: Real estate, technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.
I don't wear hair gel. - Really?
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.
just make sure you don't touch anything in here.
Hey, I was born careful.
hope that wasn't expensive.
Oh, wait... Just... I'm...
Oh, boy. - Please tell me that wasn't you.
Mr. Winters. - Miss O'Neil.
all the pieces are coming together.
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.
nice to meet you, Kenny. - Boyfriend. It's Casey.
so you were successful? - Yes. The fourth general.
I want to ask you before I go...
...if I could take one last look?
I believe this is the one they call General Akeela?
it's actually "Aguila," but that was a good try.
these statues may appear to be only stone...
...but they're like family to me. I didn't choose them.
friends you can choose, but never your family.
okay, then.
take care, Mr. Winters.
if you've come to kill me, could you make it fast?
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10. I'd rather miss it.
if we had come here to hurt you, you'd be hurting already.
the Foot Clan and I have come to hear your offer.
well, it appears that today is my lucky day.
I must warn you, we do not come cheap.
does it look like money is of any concern to me?
only time is of the essence, my dear.
since you're so rich and powerful...
...what is it we could possibly have to offer you?
I need you to be my eyes and ears.
I have some friends coming to town...
...that I'd like to roll out the red carpet for.
greet them warmly and bring them to me.
and how will we know these friends?
don't worry, they're impossible to miss.
and you keep them up. Got that?
and don't let me catch you calling the cops.
what? Not again.
didn't I take care of you last week?
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.
I'm very disappointed in you, knucklehead.
guess night school's in session.
hope I'm not disturbing class.
Hey, Nightwatcher, need any teaching assistants?
Oh, no. Casey.
I got this one covered, pal. Thanks, but no, thanks.
you think you own these rooftops? I happen to think you could use my help.
and I could use a sidekick.
you may have everyone else fooled, but you haven't fooled me, Raph.
Yeah, well, guess what, pal. Now you...
Hey, wait a minute. How did you know it was me?
wasn't that hard, man. You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.
it's that obvious, huh?
I should've stayed in law school. - Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.
well, looks like I got a sidekick.
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.
what, is it performance art? I don't get it. - What was I supposed to do...
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
I mean, we haven't heard word one from him...
...since Splinter sent him away on his little vacation.
you think these lowlifes take vacations at the first sign of pressure?
no. The criminal element of this city may be guilty of a lot of things...
...but being quitters ain't one of them.
you know, I don't even care about Leo anymore.
kind of hope he never comes back.
come on, aren't you being a little hard on the guy?
I don't know. It's possible.
I guess if I could live anywhere other than the city, I'd go too.
but I could never leave this place.
I can't even sleep without the sound of the subway rumbling over my head.
I guess it comes from growing up with a houseful of brothers.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
I'm just saying that if it was my brother, I'd find a way to work it out.
but that's just me.
I got my own issues, you know? Like back at home, with April.
there's this whole thing about settling down...
...that makes me miss the old times.
I don't know if I can be the grownup she needs me to be.
good talk, Raph.
arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.
the Stars of Kikan align.
all ye generals, wake from your stone slumber.
dude.
dude.
enter.
kneel, my son.
I return from my training, master.
I was so caught up in my own world, I forgot about everyone else.
I'm sorry I failed.
on the contrary, my son...
...now you are much stronger.
your strength is needed here now.
you owe me no apology, but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.
your absence has been particularly difficult for him...
...though he'll never admit it.
I'm certain things will be back to normal in no time, master.
good. Because until you can act as one, you are forbidden to fight.
Yes, sensei.
I have missed you, Leonardo.
I've missed you too, Father.
your brother is home.
Hey. - Hey.
welcome home.
Yeah. Thanks.
well, I'm going to bed.
Hey, Leo's back. Better go say hello before he leaves again.
what? Leo. - Hey.
Hey. - Huh, Leo?
is that really you? - Yeah.
I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I? - No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.
Oh, good. I have nightmares about birthday parties.
okay, Leo, I'll bite. What are we doing up here?
I told Splinter I'd get this team in shape again.
Hey, I've been training. Since you left, my video-game scores have, like, doubled.
right, and while you've been playing games, brother...
...Nightwatcher's come into the neighborhood...
...like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...
...and the Nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the slack.
crime never took a break. You did.
I heard his bike turns into a plane or, like, a jetpack.
Hey, Don, you're so smart, why don't we have jetpacks?
that's good, Mikey. I don't even trust you with a driver's license.
have you seen the way this guy behaves...
someone's cranky.
okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. - Raph, wait.
splinter told us not to fight.
jungle boy." Good one."
all right. But remember, we're only up here for training.
you know what I always say, "Train by doing, dude.
Mikey, when have you ever said that?
you smell that? It's like a monkey cage up here.
wow, good news is, there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...
...getting the snot kicked out of them.
bad news is, this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon.
Yeah, so? You think we should help these guys?
I'd rather enjoy the show. What do you say, fearless leader?
we're not... - I say we stop talking.
come here, fuzzy wuzzy.
you.
I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
we're trying to help you. - Never.
team.
wait, the Shredder's dead.
who are you working for?
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.
that was too easy.
like I said, too easy.
bad dog.
look at me. Found the elevator.
Oh, my shoulder.
my spleen.
this place needed a skylight.
this is why we need jetpacks.
okay, any more bright ideas? - How about this?
when this is over, I'm totally calling the architect.
wait a minute. How did something that big just disappear? It doesn't...
dude, it's the cops.
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.
I give us a 10 for style, an eight for skill...
...and a two for stealth.
what seems to be the problem?
the problem is that we were hired to merely patrol the city...
...and report anything strange to you.
you never said anything about monsters.
now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group have been reduced to hired guns...
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.
and I expect you to honor it.
you do understand honor, don't you?
so how did we fare?
my, my, my. And what is your name?
were there any problems, general?
none, my lord.
then show these fools how a true warrior acts.
keep them on schedule in completing their task.
we do not need any help.
nevertheless, Karai, I trust my family more than I trust you.
you may be the eyes and ears, but they are the muscle.
they will help you gather the remaining 12 of these abominations...
...so we can finally see our birthrights fulfilled.
it's going to be quite a party.
dudes, did anyone get the license plate of that thing that hit us last night?
my head.
okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot, then that hideous monster.
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.
Yeah, that would make her your mom too, doofus.
Yeah, whatever.
keep laughing. Last night was an embarrassment.
I'll tell you what's embarrassing. You can't follow a single order.
Oh, how cute. You've been back for five minutes...
...and now you're schooling us on your master plan?
okay, so this is my fault now, huh, Raph?
I'm the only one that has to be responsible?
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.
dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.
good morning, my sons.
good morning, sensei. - Sup?
every ninja's day should start with a healthy breakfast.
it fills me with pride to see you boys together again.
if anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
hothead. - Splinter Jr.
Cody is going to break up with Donna. I just know it.
we interrupt the Gilmore Girls for this special news report.
monsters loose in the city?
strange reports are coming in about an incident...
...that sounds like something out of science fiction.
boys!
Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
you are the eldest of your brothers.
I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family.
this is why I have forbidden any surface activity.
we cannot return to the surface to fight evil...
...if we continue to fight each other.
but Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so...
there are no excuses when you are the leader, my student.
we have to go out and find who's responsible for this.
there ain't no other solution.
save the brute-vigilante junk for that Nightwatchman.
Nightwatcher. - Nightwatcher.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm going out.
witnesses say there are holes in the floors...
...as if something or someone had just blasted straight down through them...
...leaving authorities scratching their heads.
well, at least some people care about justice these days.
Hey, Casey.
Raph? - Meet me on the roof, okay?
what is it?
the roof. You know what the roof is, don't you?
pushy sidekick.
we've gotten this image in from an amateur cameraman...
...and I do stress "amateur.
Casey, come look at this.
be safe.
what's this all about, Raph?
we got bigger things to worry about than criminals.
like what?
come on.
I think we lost it.
it's gotta be around here somewhere.
I don't think so.
what's going on, Raph?
did I mention we ran into a monster last night?
no, you kind of failed to tell me about that one, buddy.
you do know I only have a wooden bat, don't you?
the Foot? I thought they were history.
and now we got walking statues? You got a plan for those?
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.
and who knows? These guys might be friendly.
friendly.
wait a second. Those statues look...
witnesses.
watch out.
I don't feel so good.
that can't be good.
that's just rude.
Hey, wait up.
Raph? - Come here.
what, you never heard of smoke pellets? - Warn me next time.
I got allergies.
come on. That's the second mask this week.
they'll never find us in here.
stay with me, now. We'll be out of here soon.
no.
and I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.
some people just can't take a hint.
this is the police. You on the roof, put your hands behind your...
what is that? Tommy, you see this?
Yeah, you better run.
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...
...you sure know how to show a lady a good time.
Oh, no. I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.
my compliments to the chef.
anyone for dessert?
no. - Yes.
Cowabunga Carl Party Services. Cowabunga, dude.
Raph's hurt. You need to get over here. - Slow down, April.
what happened to Raph? - I don't know. He's unconscious.
we'll be right there.
Leo. You came back.
sorry the reunion isn't under better circumstances.
nice pad, kids.
Oh, hey, Raph.
well, his vital signs seem to be okay.
pupil dilation is normal.
some sort of stone. Probably obsidian, I think.
well, is he gonna be all right?
you're still here? Go back to your jungle.
well, at least his personality's still intact.
and there's an engraving on it. Looks South American.
that's your department, April.
would it help if I told you that those statues you collected for Winters...
...were shooting these things at me and Raph?
the legend of Yoatl." It can't be.
it was just a myth...
...a scary story the locals told kids around a campfire.
whoa, what are you talking about?
they say 3000 years ago, some great warrior...
...actually found a portal to another dimension.
and when the portal opened...
...the energy from it gave the warrior eternal life.
but it also turned his generals to stone.
what if this warrior just kept living forever?
he would spend the rest of his days in regret...
...spending all of his riches and all of his power...
...to find a way to revive his stone generals.
maybe, just maybe...
...he's built a new empire.
but, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.
if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name written all over it.
how do you figure that, Donnie? - Yeah.
because this has Winters' name written all over it.
now I know who to thank for this shot in the arm.
so where do we find this guy and his stone jokers?
we're not going until we get Splinter's blessing.
you're gonna quote a rulebook to me that you ain't been following for a year?
if you got something you wanna get off your shell, now's the time.
but I'm not gonna stand here and debate Splinter's orders with you.
fine, then. I quit.
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.
sometimes just taking a breather is the best thing to do.
whatever.
to picking up the pieces.
what is it?
two creatures remain, my lord.
well, by all means, then, let's finish it.
and you will finally be free of your stone prison.
but if the curse is broken, we will no longer be immortal.
brother, do not question my command.
here we go, now. - So, what are we looking for?
well, according to these star charts, the portal is set to open...
...directly over Winters Tower in the next 24 hours.
so the legend is right. Three thousand years.
and when the portal opens, we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.
within days, the country. And within weeks, the world.
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet, only monsters come out?
Yes. I guess so.
I'm smart.
I'm okay.
why do we need Raph, anyway?
it's his temper that always jeopardizes all our missions.
okay, Leo. Whatever you say. Nobody was talking about him.
Leonardo, this team you are so eager to lead is incomplete.
you know what you must do.
Yes, sensei.
generals, I think our brother has plans to betray us.
the 13th monster must not be found.
why don't we take one more call about these monster sightings?
suffern, New Jersey, you're on.
monster sightings.
a monster!
attention, all on-duty officers:
report of a disturbance on 32nd. No units available.
they're playing my song.
where are the cops? How come the cops haven't shown up?
just remember what my analyst said, just go to my happy place.
everything's gonna be fine. Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin.
don't get up. I'll serve myself.
look at you. Ain't you cute?
you want a butt-kicking, little fella? Yes, you do. You do.
come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you to hurty town. Come on, little guy.
get off of me, you little monster.
you're scratching the helmet.
okay, that was different.
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof. Get off of me.
come on.
how about a snack, little fella?
catch.
keep on running, you filthy little hermit crab.
that spicy meatball's on the house.
big guy, please don't hurt me.
what? I'm not robbing you, I'm helping you.
okay, whatever you say, sir. Please, I got kids in college.
community college.
here you go, pal. Make sure this is safe.
take everything. I'm not even looking. Go.
why is it everyone's got such a hard time believing I am a good guy?
I just saved your life.
this night just keeps getting better and better.
get off my car.
I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions...
...but you can't change the world like this.
the road you're on is a dead end. - Is he kidding?
I've tried it. - He's lecturing.
so I'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away...
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.
okay, Leo...
...time to teach you a lesson.
look, trust me when I tell you, you don't wanna do this.
Oh, yeah. Well, I notice you got quite a temper.
Hey, have you ever done this before?
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?
all right. Finally, some excitement.
funny thing about anger:
let it consume you, and soon enough...
...you lose sight of everything.
good night, dark prince.
what?
you are so smug, you know that?
you think the world revolves around you, don't you?
we couldn't survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo...
...to guide us through our problems.
well, I got a news flash for you: We got along just fine without you.
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"? Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?
risking the safety of our family? I mean, come on, what were you thinking?
don't push it. You can't leave and come back...
...expecting us to fall in line like your little soldiers.
Hey, I was training. Training to be a better leader, for you.
why do you hate me for that? - And whoever said I wanted to be led?
I'm better off calling my own shots now. Get used to it.
you aren't ready. You're impatient and hot-tempered.
and more importantly, I'm better than you.
Oh, you know something, big brother?
I'd have to disagree with you on that one.
don't do this, Raph.
I'm done taking orders.
not human...
...but clearly not the final monster.
Yoatl won't know the difference.
by the time our brother discovers this turtle is not the 13th monster...
...it will already be too late.
Leo. Hang on.
No!
Raphael. What is the matter?
I was out. I was out and I did... I did something.
something happened and then l... And I...
Raphael. Kneel.
I did something.
I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
go on.
I know why you chose him now.
I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not.
Raphael, you always bear the world's problems on your shoulders.
it is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others.
but you must realize that while, at times, you may not be my favorite student...
...it does not mean that you are my least-favorite son.
you are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault.
these are the merits of a great leader as well...
...but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
but, Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight.
I mean big.
they took him.
Yeah.
then the time for hiding is over.
we must return to the surface to take back what is ours.
by your wish, Father.
long have we been in hiding. Perhaps too long.
well, what do we do now?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
we're gonna rescue our brother, and then we're gonna save New York City.
I got it on my last trip to Japan. You like it?
Oh, yeah.
no way.
you can't go trick-or-treating without your mask.
Oh, babe. Thanks.
as ordered, no one gets into the tower...
...no one interferes, no one bears witness.
you've got to be kidding me.
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.
leave now.
Oh, but you don't understand, lady. I got...
at last. After 3000 years, the time is finally at hand.
What...? What have you done?
your time for giving orders is over.
you don't understand.
I want to send these creatures back...
...to undo the damage that was done so many years ago.
time has done nothing but made you weak.
we have our own plans.
immortality is a curse, brother.
trust me, I've lived long enough to know.
we have to find that 13th monster. It's time to end it.
no.
our time is just beginning.
little help, Don. - I'm on it.
heads up, dudes.
goal.
guys, front door's open. Now.
two minutes for high sticking.
dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.
dudes, what do we do? - I'm working on it.
you break it, you buy it.
Yeah. All right.
all right. Nice.
nice work, Jones. - I have my moments.
whoa, check it out.
that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume.
cool. I want one.
Leo, is that you?
sorry, wrong cage.
Leo. I got him. - Out of the way, please.
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.
there you go.
you're gonna need these if you're gonna lead us out of here.
I'm gonna need you too.
winters. - Looks more like fall. Get it?
Mikey, remember our talk.
looks like someone got to him before us.
is he dead?
not so immortal, huh, dudes?
your time's run out, Winters.
miss O'Neil.
I must have hit my head pretty hard. I'm seeing giant turtles.
we know what you're up to, Winters. We know about the portal...
...and we think that it's time you sent all these monsters home.
I couldn't agree with you more.
it is time to put an end to the curse that I have brought upon myself...
...and this world.
that's what this is about, Miss O'Neil: Penance.
I must return all 13 beasts or our curse will continue.
and that is a torment I can no longer bear.
then you should be put out of your misery.
I think we walked in on a family feud, guys.
the time has come to reopen the portal and rain destruction upon the Earth.
nothing will stand in our way...
...when we have an army at our command.
my brothers, l... - We are no brothers to you.
with one monster still free, the curse will never be broken.
we shall finish what we began all those years ago.
and we will finally have our victory.
join us. Join us, Foot Clan.
swear your allegiance to us and no harm will befall you.
the Foot ninja is not without honor. We work for Winters, not you.
okay, what does that mean?
it means we're going to help you.
my ninja will find the last monster and you will bring it back here.
hurry, we don't have much time.
Hey. I got shotgun.
forget about them.
by the time they return, the portal will already be closed...
...with you inside it.
I hate to see brothers fight like this.
unless it's together.
hate to rain on your parade, pal, but we thought we'd even the odds.
we're going to enjoy this.
if you please. They can defeat them.
they are a team.
let's hope so, because if not, Aguila will use the portal...
...to draw forth an army of evil and the world will be lost.
more beasts. Let's send them back where they belong.
temper, temper.
come to daddy.
thing about you immortal stone guys is...
...you know, you're immortal and made of stone.
I sound like Mikey.
you fight well. You should join us.
no, thanks, I'm good.
these guys really don't die. Sensei, are you all right?
we must do this more often.
I still got it.
they'd better hurry with that last monster.
I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
that's what I'm afraid of.
can't this piece of junk go faster?
wanna drive? - I would, as a matter of fact.
you would think they would be more concerned about the 13th monster.
boys, we must finish this now.
so did we win?
foolish creatures. We are immortals made of stone.
without the final monster to break our curse...
...we will never be stopped.
special delivery.
look out.
so did we win now?
Yeah, I think we did. - We won.
all right. - Yeah!
all right. That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah!
nice parallel parking.
next time, I'm driving.
Hey. Watch the hair.
typical. We do all the work, he gets all the thanks.
you are every bit the warriors I was informed you were.
you have passed.
savor your victory tonight.
for soon, we will have further business together.
the kind that involves familiar faces from your past.
she doesn't mean...
come on. What is it with ninjas and smoke pellets?
looks like you picked a good time to come home.
thanks for bringing me back.
I'm never usually that happy to be in pain.
he's happy because he's mortal again, Mikey.
april. I've had my eye on you for a long time.
I knew it.
I've always known that you'd be the one to help me find my way home.
and thank you...
...brothers.
you've made a very old man very, very happy.
so, what happens now?
okay. Just a little bit creepy.
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no... My no... My no...
gross. Somebody give me a hankie.
now he's in my mouth.
tastes awful.
you got room for one more?
can I get rid of this too?
we live together. We train together.
we fight together. We stand for good, together.
we are ninjas.
we strike hard, defend, protect, and fade into the night.
and there ain't no bad guy or monster gonna ever change that.
that's what's important.
and that's why we'll always be brothers.
Oh, I love being a turtle.
four turtles...
...four brothers...
...genetically reborn in the sewers of New York.
named after the great Renaissance masters...
...and trained as ninjas.
they battled many creatures and foes before defeating their archenemy...
...the Shredder.
but now a greater evil is poised to destroy their very brotherhood.
an evil born 3000 years ago.
it was in that time that a warrior king named Yoatl...
...led a brotherhood that fought side by side with one purpose:
to conquer all the kingdoms of the world.
nothing could stand in their way...
...as they left a trail of destruction behind them.
in his quest, the warrior learned of a constellation...
...known as the Stars of Kikan.
every 3000 years, the stars would align...
...opening a portal to a world of unknown power.
he became immortal...
...but at a price.
his brotherhood was turned to stone.
and upon the portal's opening...
...13 monsters were released into our world.
the warrior king was left to eternally walk the Earth...
...unable to die or forget his horrible mistake.
and the monsters that were unleashed...
...continue to plague mankind to this very day.
monsters.
no.
we appreciate the generous donation...
...for the continued protection of your village.
after all, the jungle can be a very dangerous place.
mama! - Oh, she is dangerous.
there's monsters out there.
watch where you're going.
there's a log on the road, se? Or.
well, if you're not too busy, remove it.
who are you? Show yourself.
the ghost of the jungle. He punishes those who prey upon the weak.
he's coming.
I just remembered I left the stove on. My wife hates that.
coward. Get back here. - You're on your own, jefe.
show yourself. Do you realize who you're dealing with?
what is this...? What?
I am not afraid of a myth.
I'm not afraid of a ghost.
what are you?
it's a miracle.
the ghost of the jungle.
there. That's where I saw him.
thank you.
you'd better get home now.
do you know the ghost?
he wasn't always a ghost.
Hello?
is anyone here?
Hello?
it's a long way from the city to just drop in.
you came all the way down here to look for me?
actually, I was already here on business.
but then the local legend started sounding familiar...
...so I decided to snoop around.
what kind of business? - Ancient artifacts.
some tycoon with too much time on his hands...
...has his heart set on a collection of 3000-year-old statues.
well, you always did run with a strange crowd, April.
Yeah, well. Our strange crowd hasn't been the same without you.
things aren't looking so good back home.
how bad could it be?
Donnie's probably got everything under control.
sir? Sir. Sir.
did you turn the computer on? Have you plugged it in?
Yeah, that would help.
no, I'm not playing hard to get.
I'm telling you, sir, it's not that kind of phone line.
I'm not your enemy. I'm just Donnie, your friendly IT tech support...
...Here to help you 24 hours a day, sir.
Yeah, I'm sorry. Ma'am.
but Donnie's a genius. Why would he take a job like that?
at least he's keeping busy.
well, if he's doing that, who's keeping an eye on Mikey?
Mike's gotten into the entertainment business.
Yeah.
happy birthday from Cowabunga Carl.
take it easy, little dudes. I bruise easily.
Hey, black-and-blue clashes with green, dudes. Hey, that's...
he's a big hit.
all right. Let's hear it. What's Raph doing?
no one really knows. He just sleeps all day.
well, what's he do all night?
2802, 2802, burglary in progress at 55th and Broadway.
suspects considered armed and dangerous.
time to punch in.
good work, boys. That was easier than I thought it was gonna be.
Hey, look, guys. I grabbed a toaster.
I love your work ethic, Tommy. It's an inspiration to us all.
what was that?
what's going on, guys?
what in the...?
looks like it's just you and me, shaky.
take it easy. I'm not gonna hurt you...
...much.
I love when they play hard to get.
the Nightwatcher.
he's doing our job for us again. - Tommy.
keep your hands to yourself. - Hey, who's tickling me?
your training period ended a year ago.
and Splinter says you don't write anymore.
splinter sent me down here to become a better leader.
I can't go back a failure.
besides, these people need me more than my brothers do.
if Master Splinter were here...
...he would ask you, "What is your heart telling you?
I don't know. I just know something's missing.
your brothers need you, Leo.
they're lost without you.
why skate a halfpipe when you can skate a sewer pipe?
sewer's up, bra.
Hey.
Cowabunga.
dude. Going down.
Yeah.
here's Mikey.
guys?
anyone?
Hello?
whatever.
this place used to be fun.
and with rocketing interest rates, that's bad news for homeowners...
...as the real-estate market continues its downward spiral.
coming up, the vigilante known as Nightwatcher strikes again.
now, I can't say for sure, but he was definitely an alien.
I think it's a disgrace, taking the law into your own hands like that.
leave it to the police. - Up next...
I remember how that used to feel, busting up crime syndicates.
sure, they had a bunch of guns, but they weren't like these guns.
why do you do this to yourself, Mikey? Those glory days are over.
forget about them. Get on with your life. Concentrate on your work.
Yeah, yeah. Spoken like a true has-been.
well, look who woke up.
I suppose you think the Nightwatcher is some kind of hero.
beats sitting around doing nothing while dirtbags run free.
I would love to know what it is that you do that's so great.
we're contributing around here. All you do is sleep.
Yeah, I do nothing. You're right. You got me all figured out.
I know that your attitude has been a source of contention to this team.
you think fear is the best way to accomplish things.
first of all, this team you speak of doesn't exist anymore.
and second of all...
enough.
I think I made my point.
that doesn't prove anything.
why couldn't you send him away for training?
Donatello, this home has become like an empty shell.
each of your brothers has strengths and weaknesses.
you must learn to be strong when they are weak.
if you don't learn to recognize this...
...then all hope is lost for our family.
keep it coming.
Hey, careful.
those aren't souvenirs.
sorry about that, ma'am.
where are you, Casey?
come on. Come on, pick up.
don't do this to me again. Not now.
Casey can't come to the phone right now because we're hardly working.
this better be good.
Casey, I am standing on the dock with a priceless statue and no delivery truck.
so my question is, where are you? - April.
Hey, babe. I am so sorry. I set the alarm clock, but...
it's broken. The clock...
it's bad enough that you're out every night playing vigilante...
...but we've got a deadline to meet. - I'm sorry.
Oh, wait, babe, real quick. You left a message saying you found Leo.
I mean, is he there with you? - No.
I found him. He's not coming back.
but didn't you tell him how weird things have gotten with the Turtles?
look, Casey, we're gonna lose the biggest client we have...
...if you don't get down here.
all right. I'm on my way.
please tell me we're getting paid by the pound here.
is this place a museum or what?
you've never heard of Winterscorp? - That's what I'm telling you.
they're into everything: Real estate, technology, pharmaceuticals, hair gel.
I don't wear hair gel. - Really?
I'm the caveman type, au naturel.
just make sure you don't touch anything in here.
Hey, I was born careful.
hope that wasn't expensive.
Oh, wait... Just... I'm...
Oh, boy. - Please tell me that wasn't you.
Mr. Winters. - Miss O'Neil.
all the pieces are coming together.
Oh, my. This is my associate, Casey.
nice to meet you, Kenny. - Boyfriend. It's Casey.
so you were successful? - Yes. The fourth general.
I want to ask you before I go...
...if I could take one last look?
I believe this is the one they call General Akeela?
it's actually "Aguila," but that was a good try.
these statues may appear to be only stone...
...but they're like family to me. I didn't choose them.
friends you can choose, but never your family.
okay, then.
take care, Mr. Winters.
if you've come to kill me, could you make it fast?
I've got a shareholders' meeting at 10. I'd rather miss it.
if we had come here to hurt you, you'd be hurting already.
the Foot Clan and I have come to hear your offer.
well, it appears that today is my lucky day.
I must warn you, we do not come cheap.
does it look like money is of any concern to me?
only time is of the essence, my dear.
since you're so rich and powerful...
...what is it we could possibly have to offer you?
I need you to be my eyes and ears.
I have some friends coming to town...
...that I'd like to roll out the red carpet for.
greet them warmly and bring them to me.
and how will we know these friends?
don't worry, they're impossible to miss.
and you keep them up. Got that?
and don't let me catch you calling the cops.
what? Not again.
didn't I take care of you last week?
Hey. Oh, no. Come on, now. Wait.
I'm very disappointed in you, knucklehead.
guess night school's in session.
hope I'm not disturbing class.
Hey, Nightwatcher, need any teaching assistants?
Oh, no. Casey.
I got this one covered, pal. Thanks, but no, thanks.
you think you own these rooftops? I happen to think you could use my help.
and I could use a sidekick.
you may have everyone else fooled, but you haven't fooled me, Raph.
Yeah, well, guess what, pal. Now you...
Hey, wait a minute. How did you know it was me?
wasn't that hard, man. You know, you look like a big, metal turtle.
it's that obvious, huh?
I should've stayed in law school. - Ain't that cute? He's trying to get away.
well, looks like I got a sidekick.
Yeah, right. You're the sidekick.
what, is it performance art? I don't get it. - What was I supposed to do...
...sit around, wait for Leo to come back and save the day?
I mean, we haven't heard word one from him...
...since Splinter sent him away on his little vacation.
you think these lowlifes take vacations at the first sign of pressure?
no. The criminal element of this city may be guilty of a lot of things...
...but being quitters ain't one of them.
you know, I don't even care about Leo anymore.
kind of hope he never comes back.
come on, aren't you being a little hard on the guy?
I don't know. It's possible.
I guess if I could live anywhere other than the city, I'd go too.
but I could never leave this place.
I can't even sleep without the sound of the subway rumbling over my head.
I guess it comes from growing up with a houseful of brothers.
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
I'm just saying that if it was my brother, I'd find a way to work it out.
but that's just me.
I got my own issues, you know? Like back at home, with April.
there's this whole thing about settling down...
...that makes me miss the old times.
I don't know if I can be the grownup she needs me to be.
good talk, Raph.
arise, my brothers. Arise, dear sister.
the Stars of Kikan align.
all ye generals, wake from your stone slumber.
dude.
dude.
enter.
kneel, my son.
I return from my training, master.
I was so caught up in my own world, I forgot about everyone else.
I'm sorry I failed.
on the contrary, my son...
...now you are much stronger.
your strength is needed here now.
you owe me no apology, but perhaps you should talk to Raphael.
your absence has been particularly difficult for him...
...though he'll never admit it.
I'm certain things will be back to normal in no time, master.
good. Because until you can act as one, you are forbidden to fight.
Yes, sensei.
I have missed you, Leonardo.
I've missed you too, Father.
your brother is home.
Hey. - Hey.
welcome home.
Yeah. Thanks.
well, I'm going to bed.
Hey, Leo's back. Better go say hello before he leaves again.
what? Leo. - Hey.
Hey. - Huh, Leo?
is that really you? - Yeah.
I'm, like, dreaming, aren't I? - No, Mikey, you're not dreaming.
Oh, good. I have nightmares about birthday parties.
okay, Leo, I'll bite. What are we doing up here?
I told Splinter I'd get this team in shape again.
Hey, I've been training. Since you left, my video-game scores have, like, doubled.
right, and while you've been playing games, brother...
...Nightwatcher's come into the neighborhood...
...like some kind of vigilante showboat. But his days are done.
Hey, you went AWOL, Leo...
...and the Nightwatcher was the only guy to pick up the slack.
crime never took a break. You did.
I heard his bike turns into a plane or, like, a jetpack.
Hey, Don, you're so smart, why don't we have jetpacks?
that's good, Mikey. I don't even trust you with a driver's license.
have you seen the way this guy behaves...
someone's cranky.
okay, jungle boy. Grab a vine. - Raph, wait.
splinter told us not to fight.
jungle boy." Good one.
all right. But remember, we're only up here for training.
you know what I always say, "Train by doing, dude.
Mikey, when have you ever said that?
you smell that? It's like a monkey cage up here.
wow, good news is, there's a bunch of Foot ninjas...
...getting the snot kicked out of them.
bad news is, this thing is gonna run out of bodies soon.
Yeah, so? You think we should help these guys?
I'd rather enjoy the show. What do you say, fearless leader?
we're not... - I say we stop talking.
come here, fuzzy wuzzy.
you.
I think we're getting off on the wrong foot here.
we're trying to help you. - Never.
team.
wait, the Shredder's dead.
who are you working for?
Hey, a little help, O fearless one.
that was too easy.
like I said, too easy.
bad dog.
look at me. Found the elevator.
Oh, my shoulder.
my spleen.
this place needed a skylight.
this is why we need jetpacks.
okay, any more bright ideas? - How about this?
when this is over, I'm totally calling the architect.
wait a minute. How did something that big just disappear? It doesn't...
dude, it's the cops.
Oh, yeah. The turtles are back, dudes.
I give us a 10 for style, an eight for skill...
...and a two for stealth.
what seems to be the problem?
the problem is that we were hired to merely patrol the city...
...and report anything strange to you.
you never said anything about monsters.
now, I'm sorry that your illustrious group have been reduced to hired guns...
...but I believe we made a deal, Karai.
and I expect you to honor it.
you do understand honor, don't you?
so how did we fare?
my, my, my. And what is your name?
were there any problems, general?
none, my lord.
then show these fools how a true warrior acts.
keep them on schedule in completing their task.
we do not need any help.
nevertheless, Karai, I trust my family more than I trust you.
you may be the eyes and ears, but they are the muscle.
they will help you gather the remaining 12 of these abominations...
...so we can finally see our birthrights fulfilled.
it's going to be quite a party.
dudes, did anyone get the license plate of that thing that hit us last night?
my head.
okay, that was just weird. I mean, first the Foot, then that hideous monster.
Yeah. It looked like your mom, dude.
Yeah, that would make her your mom too, doofus.
Yeah, whatever.
keep laughing. Last night was an embarrassment.
I'll tell you what's embarrassing. You can't follow a single order.
Oh, how cute. You've been back for five minutes...
...and now you're schooling us on your master plan?
okay, so this is my fault now, huh, Raph?
I'm the only one that has to be responsible?
Hey, you're the trained master, not me.
dudes, can it. Here comes Splinter.
good morning, my sons.
good morning, sensei. - Sup?
every ninja's day should start with a healthy breakfast.
it fills me with pride to see you boys together again.
if anyone needs me, I'll be watching my stories.
hothead. - Splinter Jr.
Cody is going to break up with Donna. I just know it.
we interrupt the Gilmore Girls for this special news report.
monsters loose in the city?
strange reports are coming in about an incident...
...that sounds like something out of science fiction.
boys!
Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
you are the eldest of your brothers.
I was counting on you to bring order to the chaos of this family.
this is why I have forbidden any surface activity.
we cannot return to the surface to fight evil...
...if we continue to fight each other.
but Master Splinter, how can I be expected to do so...
there are no excuses when you are the leader, my student.
we have to go out and find who's responsible for this.
there ain't no other solution.
save the brute-vigilante junk for that Nightwatchman.
Nightwatcher. - Nightwatcher.
Yeah, whatever.
I'm going out.
witnesses say there are holes in the floors...
...as if something or someone had just blasted straight down through them...
...leaving authorities scratching their heads.
well, at least some people care about justice these days.
Hey, Casey.
Raph? - Meet me on the roof, okay?
what is it?
the roof. You know what the roof is, don't you?
pushy sidekick.
we've gotten this image in from an amateur cameraman...
...and I do stress "amateur.
Casey, come look at this.
be safe.
what's this all about, Raph?
we got bigger things to worry about than criminals.
like what?
come on.
I think we lost it.
it's gotta be around here somewhere.
I don't think so.
what's going on, Raph?
did I mention we ran into a monster last night?
no, you kind of failed to tell me about that one, buddy.
you do know I only have a wooden bat, don't you?
the Foot? I thought they were history.
and now we got walking statues? You got a plan for those?
Yeah. Hey, those are a first for me too.
and who knows? These guys might be friendly.
friendly.
wait a second. Those statues look...
witnesses.
watch out.
I don't feel so good.
that can't be good.
that's just rude.
Hey, wait up.
Raph? - Come here.
what, you never heard of smoke pellets? - Warn me next time.
I got allergies.
come on. That's the second mask this week.
they'll never find us in here.
stay with me, now. We'll be out of here soon.
no.
and I thought Girl Scouts were pushy.
some people just can't take a hint.
this is the police. You on the roof, put your hands behind your...
what is that? Tommy, you see this?
Yeah, you better run.
I gotta hand it to you, Raph...
...you sure know how to show a lady a good time.
Oh, no. I gotta get you someplace safe, pal.
my compliments to the chef.
anyone for dessert?
no. - Yes.
Cowabunga Carl Party Services. Cowabunga, dude.
Raph's hurt. You need to get over here. - Slow down, April.
what happened to Raph? - I don't know. He's unconscious.
we'll be right there.
Leo. You came back.
sorry the reunion isn't under better circumstances.
nice pad, kids.
Oh, hey, Raph.
well, his vital signs seem to be okay.
pupil dilation is normal.
some sort of stone. Probably obsidian, I think.
well, is he gonna be all right?
you're still here? Go back to your jungle.
well, at least his personality's still intact.
and there's an engraving on it. Looks South American.
that's your department, April.
would it help if I told you that those statues you collected for Winters...
...were shooting these things at me and Raph?
the legend of Yoatl." It can't be.
it was just a myth...
...a scary story the locals told kids around a campfire.
whoa, what are you talking about?
they say 3000 years ago, some great warrior...
...actually found a portal to another dimension.
and when the portal opened...
...the energy from it gave the warrior eternal life.
but it also turned his generals to stone.
what if this warrior just kept living forever?
he would spend the rest of his days in regret...
...spending all of his riches and all of his power...
...to find a way to revive his stone generals.
maybe, just maybe...
...he's built a new empire.
but, hey, like I said, it's just a myth.
if you ask me, guys, this has Winters' name written all over it.
how do you figure that, Donnie? - Yeah.
because this has Winters' name written all over it.
now I know who to thank for this shot in the arm.
so where do we find this guy and his stone jokers?
we're not going until we get Splinter's blessing.
you're gonna quote a rulebook to me that you ain't been following for a year?
if you got something you wanna get off your shell, now's the time.
but I'm not gonna stand here and debate Splinter's orders with you.
fine, then. I quit.
Hey, Raph. Don't do it, man.
sometimes just taking a breather is the best thing to do.
whatever.
to picking up the pieces.
what is it?
two creatures remain, my lord.
well, by all means, then, let's finish it.
and you will finally be free of your stone prison.
but if the curse is broken, we will no longer be immortal.
brother, do not question my command.
here we go, now. - So, what are we looking for?
well, according to these star charts, the portal is set to open...
...directly over Winters Tower in the next 24 hours.
so the legend is right. Three thousand years.
and when the portal opens, we'll lose the city to monsters within hours.
within days, the country. And within weeks, the world.
Oh, so it's like Halley's comet, only monsters come out?
Yes. I guess so.
I'm smart.
I'm okay.
why do we need Raph, anyway?
it's his temper that always jeopardizes all our missions.
okay, Leo. Whatever you say. Nobody was talking about him.
Leonardo, this team you are so eager to lead is incomplete.
you know what you must do.
Yes, sensei.
generals, I think our brother has plans to betray us.
the 13th monster must not be found.
why don't we take one more call about these monster sightings?
suffern, New Jersey, you're on.
monster sightings.
a monster!
attention, all on-duty officers:
report of a disturbance on 32nd. No units available.
they're playing my song.
where are the cops? How come the cops haven't shown up?
just remember what my analyst said, just go to my happy place.
everything's gonna be fine. Happy place. I'm feeling good. I'm thin.
don't get up. I'll serve myself.
look at you. Ain't you cute?
you want a butt-kicking, little fella? Yes, you do. You do.
come on, I'm gonna drop-kick you to hurty town. Come on, little guy.
get off of me, you little monster.
you're scratching the helmet.
okay, that was different.
Hey, this thing ain't rustproof. Get off of me.
come on.
how about a snack, little fella?
catch.
keep on running, you filthy little hermit crab.
that spicy meatball's on the house.
big guy, please don't hurt me.
what? I'm not robbing you, I'm helping you.
okay, whatever you say, sir. Please, I got kids in college.
community college.
here you go, pal. Make sure this is safe.
take everything. I'm not even looking. Go.
why is it everyone's got such a hard time believing I am a good guy?
I just saved your life.
this night just keeps getting better and better.
get off my car.
I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions...
...but you can't change the world like this.
the road you're on is a dead end. - Is he kidding?
I've tried it. - He's lecturing.
so I'm gonna give you one chance to just walk away...
...and stop this vigilante nonsense.
okay, Leo...
...time to teach you a lesson.
look, trust me when I tell you, you don't wanna do this.
Oh, yeah. Well, I notice you got quite a temper.
Hey, have you ever done this before?
Oh, come on. You call that an attack?
all right. Finally, some excitement.
funny thing about anger:
let it consume you, and soon enough...
...you lose sight of everything.
good night, dark prince.
what?
you are so smug, you know that?
you think the world revolves around you, don't you?
we couldn't survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo...
...to guide us through our problems.
well, I got a news flash for you: We got along just fine without you.
Oh, and this qualifies as "just fine"? Dressing up like it's Halloween every night?
risking the safety of our family? I mean, come on, what were you thinking?
don't push it. You can't leave and come back...
...expecting us to fall in line like your little soldiers.
Hey, I was training. Training to be a better leader, for you.
why do you hate me for that? - And whoever said I wanted to be led?
I'm better off calling my own shots now. Get used to it.
you aren't ready. You're impatient and hot-tempered.
and more importantly, I'm better than you.
Oh, you know something, big brother?
I'd have to disagree with you on that one.
don't do this, Raph.
I'm done taking orders.
not human...
...but clearly not the final monster.
Yoatl won't know the difference.
by the time our brother discovers this turtle is not the 13th monster...
...it will already be too late.
Leo. Hang on.
No!
Raphael. What is the matter?
I was out. I was out and I did... I did something.
something happened and then l... And I...
Raphael. Kneel.
I did something.
I did something really stupid, Master Splinter.
go on.
I know why you chose him now.
I know that there's a reason why he's the better son and I'm not.
Raphael, you always bear the world's problems on your shoulders.
it is an admirable quality when you are a protector of others.
but you must realize that while, at times, you may not be my favorite student...
...it does not mean that you are my least-favorite son.
you are strong, passionate and loyal to a fault.
these are the merits of a great leader as well...
...but only when tempered with compassion and humility.
but, Master Splinter, I messed up big tonight.
I mean big.
they took him.
Yeah.
then the time for hiding is over.
we must return to the surface to take back what is ours.
by your wish, Father.
long have we been in hiding. Perhaps too long.
well, what do we do now?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
we're gonna rescue our brother, and then we're gonna save New York City.
I got it on my last trip to Japan. You like it?
Oh, yeah.
no way.
you can't go trick-or-treating without your mask.
Oh, babe. Thanks.
as ordered, no one gets into the tower...
...no one interferes, no one bears witness.
you've got to be kidding me.
Cowabunga, dude. I'm here for little Maxie's 13th birthday party.
leave now.
Oh, but you don't understand, lady. I got...
at last. After 3000 years, the time is finally at hand.
What...? What have you done?
your time for giving orders is over.
you don't understand.
I want to send these creatures back...
...to undo the damage that was done so many years ago.
time has done nothing but made you weak.
we have our own plans.
immortality is a curse, brother.
trust me, I've lived long enough to know.
we have to find that 13th monster. It's time to end it.
no.
our time is just beginning.
little help, Don. - I'm on it.
heads up, dudes.
goal.
guys, front door's open. Now.
two minutes for high sticking.
dudes, that rocked. Let's go again.
dudes, what do we do? - I'm working on it.
you break it, you buy it.
Yeah. All right.
all right. Nice.
nice work, Jones. - I have my moments.
whoa, check it out.
that would be the swirling vortex to another world, I assume.
cool. I want one.
Leo, is that you?
sorry, wrong cage.
Leo. I got him. - Out of the way, please.
Hey, buddy. Come on, man. Up we go.
there you go.
you're gonna need these if you're gonna lead us out of here.
I'm gonna need you too.
winters. - Looks more like fall. Get it?
Mikey, remember our talk.
looks like someone got to him before us.
is he dead?
not so immortal, huh, dudes?
your time's run out, Winters.
miss O'Neil.
I must have hit my head pretty hard. I'm seeing giant turtles.
we know what you're up to, Winters. We know about the portal...
...and we think that it's time you sent all these monsters home.
I couldn't agree with you more.
it is time to put an end to the curse that I have brought upon myself...
...and this world.
that's what this is about, Miss O'Neil: Penance.
I must return all 13 beasts or our curse will continue.
and that is a torment I can no longer bear.
then you should be put out of your misery.
I think we walked in on a family feud, guys.
the time has come to reopen the portal and rain destruction upon the Earth.
nothing will stand in our way...
...when we have an army at our command.
my brothers, l... - We are no brothers to you.
with one monster still free, the curse will never be broken.
we shall finish what we began all those years ago.
and we will finally have our victory.
join us. Join us, Foot Clan.
swear your allegiance to us and no harm will befall you.
the Foot ninja is not without honor. We work for Winters, not you.
okay, what does that mean?
it means we're going to help you.
my ninja will find the last monster and you will bring it back here.
hurry, we don't have much time.
Hey. I got shotgun.
forget about them.
by the time they return, the portal will already be closed...
...with you inside it.
I hate to see brothers fight like this.
unless it's together.
hate to rain on your parade, pal, but we thought we'd even the odds.
we're going to enjoy this.
if you please. They can defeat them.
they are a team.
let's hope so, because if not, Aguila will use the portal...
...to draw forth an army of evil and the world will be lost.

I sound like Mikey.

no, thanks, I'm good.
these guys really don't die. Sensei, are you all right?
we must do this more often.
I still got it.
they'd better hurry with that last monster.
I'm sure my man Casey's got it all under control.
that's what I'm afraid of.
can't this piece of junk go faster?
wanna drive? - I would, as a matter of fact.
you would think they would be more concerned about the 13th monster.
boys, we must finish this now.
so did we win?
foolish creatures. We are immortals made of stone.
without the final monster to break our curse...
...we will never be stopped.
special delivery.
look out.
so did we win now?
Yeah, I think we did. - We won.

I'm never usually that happy to be in pain.
he's happy because he's mortal again, Mikey.

I knew it.
I've always known that you'd be the one to help me find my way home.
and thank you...
...brothers.
you've made a very old man very, very happy.
so, what happens now?
okay. Just a little bit creepy.
Oh, gross. I think he's in my no... My no... My no...
gross. Somebody give me a hankie.
now he's in my mouth.
tastes awful.
you got room for one more?
can I get rid of this too?
we live together. We train together.
we fight together. We stand for good, together.
we are ninjas.
we strike hard, defend, protect, and fade into the night.
and there ain't no bad guy or monster gonna ever change that.
that's what's important.
and that's why we'll always be brothers.

in the winter of 1969, an elite force of the U. S. Army was sent on a top-secret assignment in southeast Vietnam.
the objective, rescue Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback from a heavily guarded NVA Prison Camp.
the mission was considered to be near suicide.
of the 10 men sent, four returned.
of those four, three wrote books about what happened.
of those three, two were published.
of those two, just one got a movie deal.
this is the story of the men who attempted to make that movie.

we got the jets coming in, big explosion, two minutes.
still rolling.
you know what? No, not still rolling. Can we cut?
we're cutting. - No, we're not. Get out!
Hey, what's going on? For real, my butt is hurting!
this harness is riding up my crack!
Damien, are we cutting? - No! No! Still rolling!
Mr. Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?
No! No. I'm not cutting! We're still rolling!
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?
are we gonna blow this tree line or what?
tuk Tuk and Kim got the blue balls here.
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

everyone, please shut up.
the jets are coming in. We only have one chance at this!
on three, baby. One, two, breathe.
look, do me a favor. I don't want to do a countdown before I do the scene.
no countdown? - No countdown.
okay. - Can we just do it off of "Action"?
just... In your own time.
good... - I'm not a rocket ship, okay?
all right, dude. - And action!
whatever floats your boat, baby. Fuck! Don't die!
Erika, get me a Vitamin Water!
you know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.
not to get into his thing, but if I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

no, no, no, we're crying! - Just call it, man!
Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry. - Thanks!

more bad news from the Vietnamese set of Tropic Thunder, where a $4 million explosion charred the Asian location and the camera wasn't even rolling.
financed by hotheaded mega-mogul Les Grossman, the film is already rumored to be one month behind schedule just five days into shooting. The reason?
fingers are pointed at rookie director Damien Cockburn, who, insiders say, can't control a star-studded cast, including flatulent star of the popular Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.
let me tell you something. A lot of people are disrespecting me.
they say that the movie's just about farts. It's about family, and... you! You can't do what I do.
fresh from his most recent arrest for heroin, glue and crack possession,
Portnoy was almost uninsurable.
also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking hip-hop hyphenate Alpa Chino.
I'm so excited; you know what I'm saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.
Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby. Drink Booty Sweat.
but the real heavyweight on the set is five-time Academy Award winner Kirk Lazarus.
the brilliant Australian known for his bad boy antics off-screen is famous for his total immersion into any role he portrays.
well, being an actor is no different than being a rugby player or a construction worker, save for the fact that my tools are the mechanisms that trigger human emotion.
Lazarus underwent a controversial pigmentation alteration procedure in order to play the platoon's African-American sergeant, Lincoln Osiris.
Yeah!
trying to hold his own onscreen with Kirk is action juggernaut Tugg Speedman.
once the highest grossing star in the world, lately his Scorcher films have lost their heat.
recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.
you have no real family.
you're on the wrong side of 40. You're childless and alone.
somebody close to you said, "One more flop and it's over."
somebody said they were close to me?
it's been a tough year for Tugg.
the disappointing buddy comedy Chitlin' & the Dude was followed by an ill-advised venture into serious dramatic territory.
simple Jack, the story of a mentally impaired farmhand who can talk to animals, was a box office disaster that many critics called, "One of the worst movies of all time.
I ain't got a good brain.
I think you've got a fine brain, Jack.
you make me happy.
but now the question is, can Speedman make audiences happy in what's being called the most expensive - war movie never made? - Rick Peck.
wishing Tugg all the best on that one.
Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker. You got time for your agent?
Rick? - Hey, buddy, guess who I'm staring at right now.
what? - I'm looking at your ugly mug on the back cover of Vanity Fair magazine, holding a cute, cuddly panda from Cutesville.
it is insane, bro. You are a rock star.
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?
from Rick.
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.
all right, that is a real satellite phone, bro.
do not re-gift.
Hey. You see that Access Hollywood piece?
Yeah, I did. It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?
but right now, you're like that kid on the playground, you know, the one who has lice that none of the other kids want to play with?
what do you mean? - I mean we gotta shave your head and get you back on the monkey bars, right?
what?
how did the crying scene go?
horrible. Lazarus started crying.
then he starts drooling and dribbling, and it wasn't even in the script...
stop right there!
you gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.
who cares how much more talented he may be than you?
if he cries, you cry harder, man.
didn't your dog have, like, leukemia or something when you were a kid? I mean, think of that.
boom! End of story. They hook up the TiVo yet?
no. - What?
they have digital cable, but, I mean, it's okay.
no, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.
it is not okay, Tugg!
and you don't need to explain to me why you need TiVo or clean water, clean sheets, food, shelter.
I mean, I fought for that in your contract.
how's the adoption thing coming, buddy?
not too great.
well, at least you get to choose yours.
I'm stuck with mine.
tell you what, get back to work, genius soldier.
the Pecker's on a TiVo mission for the Y-O-U.
work on those tears, my man.
all right. Yeah.
say it for me one time.
you make me happy. - Make me happy.
I love you, buddy. - All right, bye.
crisis meeting? What does that mean, exactly?
I mean, are we in a crisis?
he's the head of the studio.
he's reaching out. We're 10, 000 miles away.
he just wants a little face-time.
I know, it's just you said that he called it a crisis meeting. So...
it's Les Grossman. He throws these words around.
crisis," "explosion," "not rolling," "fired.
these are just words.
Yeah! Yeah!
keep a secret? A camera truck in London just plowed into Judi Dench.
trust me, he's got bigger problems.
look, he may be able to see me, but I can't see him.
move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello! - Get your ass out of my...
your feet were on my desk. - Can he see us?
I don't know why we don't have...
get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there. Hello, Les!
Hello, Les! - Okay.
we got you loud and clear here, Les.
I see you. I see you. I see you.
which one of you fuckfaces is Damien Cockburn?
that's me, sir.
it's good to finally meet you at last, get some face-time.
and who here is the key grip? You? You.
hit that director in the face, really fucking hard.
sorry, man.
this is your fault, you limey fuck!
you shit the money-bed, my friend.
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry, but I am dealing with a bunch of prima donnas!
clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry! He can't cry!
you know how you handle an actor? They whine about anything, you pull down their pants and you spank their ass.
you spank that ass, Les. - What?
spanking a child turns him into a little snot.
fear makes him a man.
I know a place where a man's worth is measured in the ears hanging from his dog tags.
the real deep shit.
you wanna make this movie right?
that's where you take your pansy-ass actors.
who is this guy?
les, that's Four Leaf.
sergeant Four Leaf Tayback. I wrote the book.
you're a great American. This nation owes you a huge debt.
now shut the fuck up and let me do my job!
look, Cockburn. - Yes.
from now on, my fist is gonna be so far up your shithole that every time you have a thought, it's gonna have to tiptoe past my wedding ring.
take control of your actors, or I will shut you down.
diet Coke!
when the herd loses its way, the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray.
four Leaf? - Come on over. It's okay.
sit down. - Yes.
so, you don't like the hotel? - Beds give me nightmares.
I'm guessing right about now you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding your prick and showing you the way.
what?
I put my story in your limp Brit hands, and you are not going to fail me.
you think I was just blowing my own bagpipe in that meeting?
you must put those boys in the shit.
what? I don't understand.
you wanna make your movie or not? - Yes, I do.
all right, you get some of those little video type cameras.
we take them out there, and we put them in the trees in different angles.
then you give me and that pyromaniac Cody all the smoke bombs, charges, explosives, detonators you got.
then we take those boys up there, me and Cody, we could light up that fucking jungle, so those lily-dick actors would be shitting their pants and screaming for their mammies.
they'd be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home.
I could do it.
I could shoot the whole thing guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.
get them away from their helpers and ass-licking assistants.
put them in the real shit.
real shit. - With real fear in their eyes!
real fear, real emotion! Yes, Four Leaf, yes!
Yes! Yes! - Yes! Yes!
take them off the fucking grid!
you are no longer actors in a movie!
you are five men in a helicopter!
with three other men!
how long are we gonna be gone, anyways?
cause I left most of my vitamins back at the hotel.
save your breath, maggots! - That's right, maggots!
go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!
move it, maggots, move! Move, grunts, move your ass!
get out, you wriggly worms!
it's up too high! - Move, move, move!
see you in hell!
this is bullshit! I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.
fucking! Jesus! Dude!
you're sitting on a nest of hostile enemy V. C.
congratulations, Fats. You just got us all killed.
anybody else care to give away our position to Charlie?
cell phones!
what the hell, Damien?
weren't no cell phones in '69, man. I'm head-to-toe legitimate.
gentlemen, I've got good news and bad news.
the studio wants to shut us down. That's the bad news.
and the good news.
if you wanna save this movie, you will become a unit.
your objective is to head north to the D'ang Kwook River and liberate the POW camp, at which point Four Leaf will get himself captured, at which point you will rescue him, at which point we will chopper you home!
damn.
four Leaf, since you're the staff sergeant, there's the map, this is the scene list.
think you can handle it?
we have rigged this entire valley of death with hidden cameras.
and I will be shooting as well, from unseen vantage points, so that every glorious moment is captured on film.
and believe me, gentlemen, it will be glorious.
if it looks real, chances are it probably is.
you wanted to be actors.
you wanted to occupy the skin of another human being.
well, get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified U. S. Infantry grunt, surrounded by death, crawling up Satan's bottom.
there'll be ambushes, enemy fire, your own little personal slice of 'Nam.
this radio goes to the chopper and the chopper only.
the chopper is God, and I am Jesus Christ, his son.
you are my chosen disciples.
and no one gets to go home till we get the shots.
put on your war faces, gentlemen.
now, let's go and make the greatest war movie ever!
Yeah! - All right!
Yeah!
Yeah!
we have an explosion in the Northern Sector
track and follow
not bad, Cockburn!
not bad.
wherever you are!
wherever he is? Looks like he's all over the place.
here we go.
must be an old French mine.
it's a remnant from colonial Indo-China. This jungle must be full of them.
don't you get it? He's messing with our heads.
that's what all that playing God stuff was about.
he's trying to get us to act good, save the movie.
he ain't playing God. He's being judged by him.
that's our objective. Complete the mission.
we have encountered a heavily armed American military force
D. E.A?
possibly
no offense, Kirk, I know you're the big fancy actor here, but I've done a lot more effects-driven event films than you. Okay?
and I think I can spot a prop head when I see one.
Oh, Jesus.
it's corn syrup, guys. Corn syrup and latex.
warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.
Oh, God.
smoke and mirrors, guys. Welcome to the movie factory.
oldest trick in the book.
he getting down now.
Oh, my God!
whoa, look at me!
you're going to get the shots, and I'm going to make sure because I'm the director.
I'm from London. I direct plays.
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!
they have no fear of death
bring them back dead or alive.
look, I'm Dave Beckham.
so, we gotta light these boys up today, huh?
blow some sense into these young men.
Hey, I don't want to come off as weird or anything, but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.
tropic Thunder. Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.
Yeah, I've never been in the military, per se, but I have lost an appendage in the line of duty.
driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.
Yeah.
it's a pretty cool sidearm you got there. What is it?
I don't know what it's called.
I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man's life.
okay.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say-so.
Damien, we're go for explosion.
do you copy?
I got an itchy trigger finger here, and I'm ready to blow some shit up.
all right, you happy now? Can we do the scene?
or do you need a formal invitation? Come on, let's go!
here. Okay.
scene 12, exterior, jungle clearing, day, ambush.
four Leaf notices movement in the brush.
a dozen guerrilla fighters can be seen moving in the tree line.
somewhere a mine explodes." And you.
I got a bad feeling on this one.
Yeah. - No, that's your line.
I got... Now? - Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.
I got a bad feeling on this one. - Dude, wait, like how?
I got a bad feeling on this one.
okay. - Action. Go, come on.
I got a bad feeling on this one there, Fats.
our asses don't get fragged in this bullshit valley, first thing I'm doing is paying my 2 bucks so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry on a sweet little mama-san's dinky dau poontang.
shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged before he get any cooch.
he die, he probably die a coochless motherfucker.
zip it, Motown.
man, I'm thirsty.
might as well have some of this Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.
yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!
ain't no Criss Angel Mindfreak,
david Blaine trapdoor horseshit jumping off here!
Hey! You wanna get on the train here, or do you wanna ruin another take?
there ain't no goddamn takes, ain't no goddamn motion picture!
you sure? - Yeah.
yeah? - For certain, man.
then why are you still in character?
I know, but I don't have to tell you.
you don't know.
man, I don't drop character till I done a DVD commentary.
you happy now? We're out of position for the effects!
get down, fool!
didn't anyone read the script? This is the ambush!
this feels pretty real! - Exactly! Let's use it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
eat lead!
they're busting caps like a motherfucker down there.
this is FUBAR. I say we juice them.
what do you think? - Juice them.
fuck you, Charlie!
big-ass titties!
look at that, huh?
and cut!
that's the trailer right there.
Yeah!
what do we do now? - Yeah.
North. Man said to head north.
did you see me shooting? - That's how we do. Good work, baby.
I believed it.
D'ang Kwook River.
I'm betting he's got more of these battles and Viet Congs rigged for us along the way.
sergeant Osiris, get your men. Load and lock.
real, baby, I'm real.
let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!
hump it up, gentlemen! Single formation.
don't dawdle now!
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface. How are we coming on that hotplate?
something's up. I think we better drag ass back there.
make sure Damien ain't forgot how to use his talkbox again.
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.
what are you doing, Jeff? - Fucking... Nothing, man!
I'm eating jellybeans. - Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please...
no, you can't have any fucking jellybeans.
they're mine.
you think you're the only one who gets sick when he doesn't have his jellybeans?
boundaries, man. Fuck.
Hey. I didn't mean to show you up back there.
it's just, I feel like we really need to set the example for the other guys.
it's gonna be tough, but I think Damien's gonna get some great shit out of us.
just wish I had a director like this on Jack.
on Jack. What? Jack? What you talking about?
simple Jack. - Oh, yeah.
simple Jack, yeah. You went all out on that one, huh?
you did. Really swung for the fences, huh?
thank you. Thanks. Yeah.
Yeah, it was an intense experience, you know.
I just did the work.
watched a lot of retarded people. Spent time with them. Observed them.
watched all the retarded stuff they did.
then again, I always found mere observation in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.
sometimes, we gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional pay dirt.
thus, we can diagram the source of the pain and then live it, you know.
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.
you know, there were times when I was doing Jack that I actually felt retarded, - like really retarded. - Damn.
in a weird way, I had to sort of just free myself up to believe that it was okay to be stupid or dumb.
to be a moron. - Yeah.
to be moronical. - Exactly, to be a moron.
an imbecile. - Yeah.
like the dumbest motherfucker that ever lived.
when I was playing the character.
when you was the character. - Yeah, as Jack, definitely.
Jack, stupid ass Jack.
by the end of the whole thing, I was like, "Wait a minute, I flushed so much out, how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?
it's just like... Right? - Yeah.
you was farting in bathtubs and laughing your ass off.
Yeah. I mean, it was really quite a... It was crazy.
it's like working with mercury. It's high science, man. It's an art form.
Yeah. - You an artist.
that's what we do, right? Yeah. - Yeah.
hats off for going there, especially knowing how the Academy is about that shit.
about what? - You're serious? You don't know?
everybody knows you never go full retard.
what do you mean? - Check it out.
Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked retarded, act retarded, not retarded.
count toothpicks, cheat at cards. Autistic, sure. Not retarded.
then you got Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump.
slow, yes, retarded, maybe, braces on his legs.
but he charmed the pants off Nixon, and he won a Ping-Pong competition.
that ain't retarded.
Peter Sellers, Being There. Infantile, yes. Retarded, no.
you went full retard, man.
never go full retard.
you don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.
remember? Went full retard? Went home empty-handed.
Oh, my God! Holy shit!
good job, turd. You killed the director.
no, that's impossible, man.
I rigged the whole tree line, and this is here.
he must have missed his mark. - Missed his mark?
Yeah, this isn't me.
come on, let's bag and tag the bastard and get back to the hotel.
you're in a world of hurt, dumbo! - We're in a world of hurt!
you're in trouble. - This isn't just on me!
we're in a... We're together on this. - Bullshit.
you're just gonna run away. You're gonna leave.
what happened to, "No man left behind," okay?
just wait, just wait! Listen! Listen, okay?
I don't wanna hear it. - Let me just be real with you, all right?
I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis on Freaky Friday, okay?
this shit will fucking ruin me!
just get off me! You're pathetic. - No, I'm not.
get off me! - You are not going back!
what the fuck? - Now wait a minute.
I fucking hate movies.
this is bullshit. I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.
No! That's my jellybeans! No!
kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!
yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut. - You go to hell! There he is.
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?
you little piece of shit! I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!
Sanducci. Hold up, man, keep it on the down-Low.
I don't really gotta piss. I'm trying to talk at you, man.
bait, I need bait.
you went to boot camp, right? You can read a map?
Yeah, I think so.
I know Speedman got everyone convinced we out here making Planet of the Apes on YouTube or some shit, but I don't buy it.
you wanna step on a real landmine? You wanna die?
you wanna get shot by a real motherfucker?
keep looking ahead, man. - No, of course not.
if I can put that map in your hands, can I count you in?
well, yeah, I guess you can. - Dynamite. I'm out.
that smelled just like bologna for some reason.
is anyone gonna fucking help me get this fucking thing?
why are they even out in the daytime?
I'm gonna level with you, bro. I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.
he's way out on a limb with this character, and I think he's getting cold feet.
I need you on my side, Kyle. - It's Kevin.
good. Can I count on you?
Yeah. If you want I could give the map a look-see.
I'll handle the map. - Okay.
you stick with the program, we get this movie in the can,
I'm thinking there could be a Teen Choice Award in it for you.
you have that potential. They'll slime you, the whole deal.
Yeah, that's wicked. - Good.
there it is! Yeah, now you're dead!
you O. D.'d!
hold up now, Jeff.
fucking hell!
what the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!
I don't have any more jellybeans.
you land there!
Wow. Look at these ruins.
where the hell are we? - D'ang Kwook River.
that so? How do you know that? How you sure?
only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now. Seriously, my skin hurts!
enough from the peanut gallery! Into the water, ladies!
no, man. Let me take a look at that map right quick.
why everybody all is obsessed with the map?
cause we're tired of being your trail donkeys!
acting like you some one-man GPS!
God damn it! We lost! We fucking super lost, man!
tell him, McClusky. Tell him what time it is.
I don't believe you people.
what do you mean "you people"?
what do you mean, "you people"?
I think what Tugg means is...
no, look at his eyes, man.
...you people, you actors. You people... - Look at them beady, white devil eyes.
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!
hell, no! - Silence!
chill! All right? Just chill it.
now, let's go get those Viet Congs.
viet Cong! - What?
it's "Viet Cong." There's no "S." It's already plural.
you wouldn't say "Chineses."
all right, that's enough of this insubordination!
if the machine breaks down, we break down.
Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I, he was big but a little puffy and then Rambo II, he got all shredded up?
Yeah. - That's kind of how you look right now.
yeah? - Not Rambo I but II.
Really? - Yeah, when he was cut up.
I'm not that... I mean, that's what I'm going for, but you know...
come on, dude. You more shredded than a julienne salad, man.
Thanks. - What's the secret, dude?
it's a diet. I'm just dieting. - Really?
cause I'm trying to come up a little, but it's just... It's tough.
you look good. - Any tips?
what? - Any tips, you got?
there's, like, the pineapple...
give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
all right, now!
what it is, Sikorski? Tell us where we really at.
that's fucking bullshit! It's a chump move.
we just getting a second opinion, doc.
we're going the wrong way!
Damn! - Son of a bitch.
God! I think we were supposed to be doing this, and instead we did this.
shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!
think you can get us back to that drop zone, boy?
this is not cool!
maybe.
this is insane!
are you really going to abandon this movie?
we're supposed to be a unit!
suck my unit!
all right, fine.
I'll finish it by myself. - You go be all you can be, man.
Tugg, you have no idea where you're going!
Yes, I do!
I'm going to, "Exterior, rain forest, dusk."
smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks alone through a frightening jungle.
suck on that unit, Kirk!
come on, men. Let's get home.
Hello, Mr. Mantis. You're beautiful.
now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo where Hollywood was split into schisms, some studios backing Blu-ray Disc, others backing HD DVD.
people thought it would come down to pixel rate or refresh rate, and they're pretty much the same.
what it came down to was a combination of gamers and porn.
now, whichever format porno backs is usually the one that becomes the most successful.
but, you know, Sony, every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.
you talking to me this whole time?
I was talking to whoever was listening to me.
Jesus Christ, man!
booty Sweat.
Oh, God!
it's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.
you want my flak jacket?
what, are you insane? It's boiling! It's like a sweat lodge out here!
keep the volume down on that bitching, Flatch Adams.
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!
how we doing? We making good time? - We're making good time, but there's no way we make it over that ridge before sundown.
all right, fellas, we're gonna make camp, rest up!
Oh, God. - Y'all might be in for a treat.
you know, back before the war broked out,
I was a saucier in San Antone.
I bet I could collar up some of them greens.
Yeah, noodle some crawfish out the paddy, yo.
and maybe some crab apples for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!
hell, yeah!
that's how we all talk. We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.
you're Australian! Be Australian! Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.
I get excited about my foods, man.
die!
No!
dude, dude, what the hell is going on here? Where are we?
I have no idea.
I've never been outside the States.
wait, what? Are you fucking kidding me?
did you make this whole goddamn thing up?
dude, were you even in the fucking service?
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.
coast Guard. - Sanitation Department.
Oh, my God! You're a fucking garbage man!
damn it. F. L. Tayback lies to me and the whole goddamn U. S. Of A.
I wrote the book as a tribute! I'm a patriot!
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli of patriots, okay?
you lied about fighting the Vietnam War.
it's like punching the American flag in the face, God damn it.
God, and to think I believed in you!
I don't wanna be next to you. - Writers lie all the time.
can I be tied to another post? Okay.
Rick? - Tugg.
I killed one, Rick.
the thing I love most in the world.
Vivica, get off the line now!
a hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.
calm down. Here's what you're gonna do.
get your hands on some bleach, some hydrogen peroxide and a shitload of lime.
no, a panda.
I killed a panda.
Amanda? Come on, dude.
I mean, that's probably not even her real name.
no, a panda!
a panda?
a sweet, cuddly, vicious little panda.
Jesus Christ, Tugg! Man, don't scare me like that!
it's beautiful here.
you on the set?
I am the set.
all right, man. Hey, how's the TiVo working out?
screw TiVo.
I'm way beyond TiVo.
last I checked, they hadn't hooked it up, though.
hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?
it doesn't matter anymore.
I've moved on.
where have you moved on to?
another agency?
Hey, who is with you?
you are still my client, Tugg Speedman! I am getting the TiVo!
jacket's on, I'm out the door!
Tugg?
please don't fire me.
Oh, mama. Thirsty.
he doesn't look too good.
must drink, so I can throw something up!
no, no. Don't drink that water! That water's like a petri dish!
no, don't!
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?
Yeah, get him chugging on some of Alpa's ass water.
that'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.
man, what you coming out in movies for anyway?
did you need another revenue stream?
for your information, my revenue stream currently generates $2 million a year in charitable contributions for my community.
hot damn. - And why am I in this movie?
maybe I just knew I had to represent, because they had one good part in it for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.
pump your brakes, kid. That man is a national treasure.
I just wanted to throw another shrimp on your barbie.
that shit ain't funny.
Hey, fellas! It's hot! We're tired! It stinks!
I'm just fucking with you, Kangaroo Jack!
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.
you know that's a true story? Lady lost her kid.
you about to cross some fucking lines. - Guys, relax and stuff.
you know what? Fuck that, man!
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger telling me...
for 400 years, that word has kept us down.
what the fuck?
it took a whole lot of trying just to get up that hill.
now we up in the big leagues, getting our turn at bat.
long as we live, it's you and me, baby.
that's the theme song for The Jeffersons. You really need help.
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song, don't make it not true.
you know what? I'm gonna tell you what's true.
I'm gonna tag you back. You better believe that, baby.
guys! Hey, guys!
Jeff, stay away from that animal.
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need...
I need to wear his stomach skin like a unitard.
ain't nobody doing nothing to no one or body!
now, if Mr. Portnoy is feeling a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk, put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!
we got ground to cover!
all right, POW camp, scene 67.
bring it on, Cockburn!
my body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.
wait, wait, wait, let me do the line again.
let me do the line again.
my body may be shackled, but my mind wanders free.
good, again. Again.
good, good. Now let's do the torture scene.
I see moss on both sides of that tree.
well, you know, maybe if I wasn't the only one at boot camp...
my belly really hurts, you guys!
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.
let me off, I gotta puke! I don't wanna die like Hendrix!
all right. All right.
are you okay, Jeff?
I'm awesome.
holy shit!
okay. Everyone, down, down, down.
man. Now I'm tripping.
that looks like the POW camp from out the script, yo.
Speedman was right?
I don't think so.
look at the cooking vats, the armed guards.
looks like a heroin processing plant.
we were in that chopper for hours.
I don't even think we're in Vietnam anymore.
fuck. - Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?
no, most likely Myanmar or Laos.
what the fuck is Laos?
it's the Golden Triangle.
the world's hard drug superhighway.
and how do you know about that?
it was a really long trip. I read the in-flight magazine.
cut!
Oh, Jesus!
what do you see, man? I'm blocked.
Damien, cut!
Hey, Damien, cut!
they got Speedman.
and it doesn't look good.
I am Tran.
you are a trespasser in my poppy fields.
you are D. E.A. Scum!
were there some re-writes that I missed?
do you want to die?
do you? - No!
please, don't hurt me!
say that again.
please, don't hurt me.
No! Like you did before! Say it!
say it!
please, don't hurt me!
what? - You are Simple Jack.
you saw Simple Jack?
we love the tale of this man, Simple Jack.
we do not have many luxury here.
and Simple Jack is the only movie we possess.
you got the VHS.
we've watched it many, many times.
you should've got Oscar.
well, you know. It's...
just to be nominated...
you were nominated?
no, no, no. I wasn't nominated.
I'm just saying that to have been nominated would have been nice.
it's just... It's very political. You have to take out ads...
shut up now! - Okay. Okay.
so, are you going to let me go, or...
no. We'll hold you for ransom.
much more money now!
he's in a meeting.
Yeah, I know. In about two seconds with the Pecker.
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.
you wanna talk about trouble? That's trouble.
what do you need, Peck?
no, more like what do you need, Les?
glasses?
what?
so you can read the Tropic Thunder contract that guarantees my client, Tugg Speedman, some form of digital video recorder on location.
huh? - I can't believe you let him in.
look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy, so why don't you get the hell out of here before I snap your dick off and jam it into your ass?
no, not you, Helen.
but I will rip your tits off if you don't get me those theaters.
perfect.
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got you on speakerphone.
I'm standing here with Les Grossman, and he is dying to tell you why he's apparently wiped his ass with the TiVo clause from your contract.
we are Flaming Dragon.
Speedman is with us now.
for 50 million, you will get him back.
are you gonna get those... - Who is this?
and how did you get this phone? - We are Flaming Dragon!
simple Jack belong to us now.
he does, does he?
let me tell you something, shitbird.
I've never even heard of your little agency.
but if you think you can poach my client...
send $50 million, or you no see Simple Jack again because we kill him.
this is Les Grossman. Who is this?
this is Flaming Dragon!
okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.
first, take a big step back and literally fuck your own face!
now, I don't know what kind of pan-Pacific bullshit power play you're trying to pull here, but Asia, Jack, is my territory.
so whatever you're thinking, you better think again.
otherwise, I'm gonna have to head down there, and I will rain down an ungodly fucking firestorm upon you.
you're gonna have to call the fucking United Nations and get a fucking binding resolution to keep me from fucking destroying you.
I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker!
I will massacre you!
I will fuck you up!
could you find out who that was? Go. - Yeah. Yeah.
you have all been working hard.
I give you Simple Jack
you wear these. More like Simple Jack teeth.
okay.
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan, and that's great...
put teeth in!
now do movie.
the whole movie?
I can't. I don't know the whole...
you perform! You perform or die!
monkey swine!
pa.
more stupid!
pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?
you saw what I saw.
Tugg Speedman is dead meat if we don't do something soon.
Yeah. We could do something by getting our asses back to the hotel, which is in the other direction!
ain't right.
what would've happened in The Great Escape if Steve McQueen and them dudes had turned tail and ran?
well, that's what that movie was about. They were escaping. They ran away.
I'm trying to agree with you. The point is they did something.
then what are we supposed to do, huh?
cause he's cleaning a gun with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.
I'm just like a little boy, playing with his dick when he's nervous.
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got an idea. This might be a little crazy.
crazy's better than nothing.
back in '98, I did a low-budget titty comedy for Skinemax.
sex Camp. Remember it? - Yeah.
anyway, me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girl camp.
so, what we did, we built a catapult out of logs and underwear, and they shot us over the wall, and we parachuted down.
look, - you guys, we already know the plan. - Fine.
we do it just like in the book, Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.
the book of Tropic Thunder.
Yeah, did you guys read the book?
the flap, I read the back flap and saw the pictures.
well, it's okay. It's exactly the same as in the script.
cool.
you guys all read the script, right?
I don't read the script, script reads me.
what the hell does that even mean?
what you getting at with the books, scripts? Spit that shit out, man!
all right. The Wet Offensive.
Osiris and Fats go undercover as a diversion.
motown and Brooklyn sneak in via the river.
Yeah. But those dudes was trained soldiers.
Yeah!
and we trained actors, motherfucker.
time to man up. And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.
some of us might not even make it back.
what do you mean? Like not on the same flight?
Alpa and I's already wearing earth mama's natural night camo.
cool it, Benson. - Sorry.
we gonna scout, get a plan together. We ain't back in 20, come looking.
we are Flaming Dragon.
okay.
flaming Dragon's a heroin manufacturer.
they're responsible for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.
huge profit margin. - Guys!
would somebody please let me know what the game plan is?
peck! We have it handled.
please, don't interrupt. Everything's under control.
I got it. Got it.
les Grossman. - We not get money yet.
price now 100 million!
you pay now, or tomorrow Simple Jack die.
great. Let me get this down.
100 million.
wait! I got a better idea.
instead of 100 million, how about I send you a hobo's dick cheese?
then you kill him! Do your thing! Skin the fucking bastard!
go to town, man! Go to town!
no... - In the meantime, and as usual, go fuck yourself!
no. - We don't negotiate with terrorists.
Hey, hey, are you insane?
I think I could've done that better. - I thought it was good.
they're gonna kill him!
and we'll weep for him, in the press.
set up a scholarship in his name.
eventually, and I'm talking way, way down the road, we file an insurance claim.
preferably before the end of the fiscal year.
actually, the claim alone would net us more than the movie would lose.
you can't be serious.
let's face it.
the kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher for Purim anymore.
Speedman is a dying star, a white dwarf heading for a black hole.
that's physics. It's inevitable.
we've been handed an incredible opportunity here, Peck.
the universe is talking to us right now.
you just gotta listen.
see, this is the good part, Pecker. This is when the job gets fun.
Yeah.
ask and you shall receive.
all right. - You play ball, we play ball.
I know you want the goodies.
welcome to the goody room.
you paying attention? 'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.
that's how you're gonna roll.
no more frequent flier bitch miles for my boy.
Yeah!
playa.
playa!
big dick playa.
swinging past your knees!
big dick, baby.
Yep.
or you can grow a conscience in the next five minutes and see where that takes you.
let me get this straight.
you want me to let my client of 15 years, one of my best friends, die in the jungle, alone, for some money and a G5?
Yes.
a G5 airplane?
Yes.
and lots of money.
playa.
Yeah!
smack it up, flip it, rub it down!
but Mama take care of Jack a lot.
how many more sleeps before she wakes up again?
sorry, Jack.
she in heaven now.
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.
she sleep forever.
to the man's credit, he's actually eased up on the retard throttle.
and now that's added a balance, and the audience can connect.
I mean, this is Theater 101, but, you know, he's had a tough road.
he'll become a naturalist.
Yeah. - Break down the aesthetic distance, then the...
told you I'd tag you back.
can I tell you that I'm sorry for any offense I might've caused, man?
I just got caught up in... - In being a dumbass?
I guess so.
why you still doing this Chicken George shit, I have no idea.
neither do I. - It's beyond me.
it's beyond me. - You confused.
I am a little confused. - I know.
but are we cool?
not really.
Hey, man.
how's it going? - Good. Yourself?
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,
I think I'm just gonna hang back here for the mission.
watch the stuff.
is that cool? - What? No!
we need you, Jeff.
what are you talking about?
okay, look, man.
I got something to tell you. - Okay.
you know those jellybeans I was eating?
well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?
they were drugs. - Really?
I get down there near the mother Lode, I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin in the fucking world.
if you guys wanna make it through this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.
are you serious? - Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.
and you can, no matter what, you can't fucking untie me until it is done, until it is out of my system.
I'm gonna say, "Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool."
I'm finally better. I'm finally better. Untie me.
don't listen to me! Anything I fucking say is a lie!
you got it!
goodbye, Mama!
now you can have ice cream in heaven.
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed, in my head movies.
but this head movie makes my eyes rain.
dang. Gilligan catching a kidney shot.
they got him on the move! - That's torture, man.
okay. That's where they keeping him.
I gotta get cracking on my costume.
say, are you good with a needle and thread?
hell, yeah.
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than five million pairs last spring at the Gap.
I sewed them patterns myself, baby. - Let's roll out.
it's a little twig man Oscar.
I'm going to call you Half Squat.
and you can call me
Papa.
wow, look at all those stars.
really makes a guy feel pretty small.
this could be the last time we look at these stars.
man, that's beauty.
nights like tonight make a man wonder what it's all about.
Hey, you guys. Anybody got some bug spray?
don't ignore me!
stick it out, man. We're gonna get through this.
Hey, Kirk? - Yeah?
are you still dating Jennifer Love Hewitt?
cause I think she's hot.
no, that was just some tabloid conjecture.
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through. You can untie me now.
funny, huh?
the circus life 280 days a year on location.
it's hard to find a girl that can hang with that, you know?
not one worth keeping, nohow.
Hey, Radar? Evans?
no, it's Kevin.
Kev, whatever the fuck. Come over here.
I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three is coming down the pike, and there's a role in there for you if you come over and untie me.
Jeff, you're just going to have to tough it out.
your mother's a cankerous whore!
Jesus, man.
Hey, man.
remember way back when I said your mother was a cankerous whore?
I'm sorry, man. I did not mean that. She's not.
how about you, man?
you got some little minx waiting for you on the other side of tomorrow?
me?
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and...
I was really hoping I'd get laid when this movie came out, but that's not gonna happen.
what about you, Masterblaster?
you got a certain someone you trying to get with back in the States?
what, Alpa Chino? He's like 10 girls deep, 24l7.
no. You missing me, man.
I'm talking about something special. Big difference.
how about it?
Yeah.
Yeah, there is.
well? What's the skinny? Y'all been on a date or what?
no. I mean...
I always wanted to, but I guess I just never had the courage to ask.
it's... It's complicated.
No! It's simple as pie, man.
you plant your feet in the ground, you look her square in the eyes, you say, "Hey, baby, you and me's going on a date." That's the end of story.
what's her name? - Lance.
listen here, Lance...
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear? Lance?
did you say "Lance"? - No!
that sounded like "Lance." - No, I said "Nance.
that's what I said, "Nance." - It sounded like "Lance.
look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?
I love the pussy! All right?
lay your ass back down and look at the stars.
when you wrote I Love Tha Pussy was you thinking of dangling your dice on Lance's forehead?
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.
man, everyone's gay once in a while. - I'm not gay!
this Hollywood.
how about we all get back to work?
okay. Cool. - This is ridiculous!
we got a big day tomorrow. Let's get focused.
Alpa, if you untie me, I will literally suck your dick right now.
I told you, for the last time, I love the pussy!
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft, work the pipe and swallow the gravy.
get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.
okay, so, what's the plan?
are you gonna talk Vietnamese to those dudes?
no. No. Mandarin Chinese.
which, from what I can tell, is what they speaking down there.
how the hell do you know Chinese?

Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece of the puzzle, buddy.

I know it sounds weird, but I have a connection with them.

he's my son. He's my boy!
he needs me. I have to go back to him.

I don't know, but you need to tell them.
I got this.
Tugg!

Upsy-daisy.

Yes! Tugg Speedman.

Yeah!
Yeah, you son of a bitch!
eight Oscars, $400 million and you saved Tugg Speedman's career.
I couldn't have done it without you, Slolom.
Really?
no, dickhead, of course I could.
a nutless monkey could do your job. - Well, I...
now, go get drunk and take credit at all the parties.
I would never do that to... - Joking.
yeah? - Yeah.
very... Okay, there he is.
there he is. Okay. - Go have fun.

No!
there she is. There she is.
there she is.
ladies and gentlemen, l've traveled over half our state to be here tonight.
l couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and l had to see about it.
that well is now flowing at 2, 000 barrels and it's paying me an income of $5, 000 a week.
l have two others drilling and l have 16 producing at Antelope, so, ladies and gentlemen if l say l'm an oilman, you will agree.
now, you have a great chance here, but bear in mind you could lose it all if you're not careful.
out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots, maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.
the rest will be speculators, that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen to get some of the money that ought, by rights, come to you.
even if you find one that has money and means to drill, he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.
he'll have to hire the job out on contract, and then you're depending on a contractor, who'll rush the job through so he can get another contract just as quick as he can.
this is the way that this works.
what is your offer? We're wasting time.
please!
l do my own drilling.
and the men that work for me, work for me and they are men l know.
l make it my business to be there and to see their work.
l don't lose my tools in the hole and spend months fishing for them.
l don't botch the cementing off and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease.
l'm a family man.
l run a family business
this is my son and my partner, H. W. Plainview.
we offer you the bond of family that very few oilmen can understand.
l'm fixed like no other company in this field and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in.
l have a string of tools all ready to put to work.
l can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week.
l have business connections so l can get the lumber for the derricks.
such things go by friendship in a rush like this.
and this is why l can guarantee to start drilling and to put up the cash to back my word.
l assure you, ladies and gentlemen, no matter what the others promise to do, when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there.
sit down! Sit down, you have no right...
let us discuss what the man has to say.
let us discuss what the man has to say.
Prescott, do you trust this man?
let's discuss what he has to say.
there's logic to what he's saying.
how does he know? My lot is there!
two or three years, it could be ten years!
we gain nothing by losing our heads!
look at that well out there!
nobody's losing their heads.
you have no business being here!
sit that woman down, sir!
you can sit down.
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.
no, Mr. Plainview! No, where are you going?
l don't need the lease. Thank you.
but we need you.
too much confusion. Thank you for your time.
no, no, there's no confusion.
l wouldn't take the lease if you gave it to me as a gift.
Mr. Bankside, l'm not going to waste your time.
l'd certainly appreciate it if you didn't waste mine.
now, if you wish to sign with me we can have a well drilling within 10 days.
your lot is further north from the discovery well up here.
that means we'll probably have to dig deeper.
and if there's as much oil here as l think there is, it'll be harder to reach, but once we find it, we can take it right out.
we have to act quickly, because very soon these fields will be dry.
l need you to know what you want to do.
now, because of the distance from the discovery well, l'll pay you a smaller royalty than you'd get down there but l'm prepared to give you a $1 , 000 bonus on your lot.
what kind of royalty are you talking about?
one sixth, plus a guarantee to start drilling within 10 days.
now, that's something you won't find anywhere else.
what age are your children, ma'am?
ten and twelve.
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir. Where is your wife?
she died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.
so it's just me and my son now.
lt's coming in, boss!
hear it?
Mr. Plainview?
yes?
are you Daniel Plainview?
Yes.
what can l do for you?
you look for oil.
that's right.
what do you pay for a place that has it?
well, that depends. What does it depend on?
on a lot of things.
lf l told you l knew a place that had oil where land could be bought cheaply, what do you think that would be worth?
l think that you should let me know what you know and then we'll try and work something out.
can l sit down? Please.
what church do you belong to?
l...
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong to one church in particular.
l like them all. l like everything. Where are you from?
that would be telling you. That's what l want to sell you.
what are you doing in Signal Hill?
we have oil, and it seeps through the ground.
do you want to pay me to know where it is?
just 'cause there's something on the ground doesn't mean there's anything beneath it.
why did Standard Oil buy up land?
ls it in California?
maybe. How much land did they buy?
l'd like it better if you didn't think l was stupid.
why did you come to me?
you just brought this well in.That's right.
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash right now and l'll tell you where it is.
l'll tell you what l'll do, son. l'll give you $100 now, and if it proves to be a promising lease then give you a $1 , 000 bonus.
six hundred dollars.
tell me one thing to help me decide. What else have you got up there?
what do you grow?
we have a big ranch, but it's mostly rocks.
plant things. Nothing will grow but weeds.
what makes you think it's up?
ls there sulfur around? Or alkali deposits?
alkali nearby. l don't know sulfur.
ls that your son?
Yes.
Hi. Hi.
who are you? l'm Fletcher Hamilton.
nice to meet you, son. What's your name?
what do you do?
l work with Mr. Plainview.
here's $500, son.
you tell me something worth hearing, this money's yours.
l come from a town called Little Boston in lsabella County.
this is us, here. Spur station here at Little Boston.
the Sunday ranch is what you're looking for.
there's a sheep trail that takes you there.
lt's a mile out of town headed west, not far.
just through a small pass here near the base of the hills.
you'll pass a church and just follow the sheep trail.
Where's Standard buying up?
here and here.
your family name is Sunday, yes? That's right.
how many's in your family?
my father and mother and sisters and my brother Eli.
how many sisters do you have? Two.
what's your name? Paul.
does any of your family know about the oil that you say is there?
l don't know.
my uncle always said there was oil there, but l don't know what they heard or what they think.
what do you grow?
lt's goats. lt's a goat farm.
l told you, nothing grows but weeds.
ls there water? lt's salty.
you drill a well, it's hard not to get saltwater.
the oil is there. l'm telling you.
l want to go now, so...
you can stay tonight.
no, l want to go now. l want to leave.
listen, Paul.
lf l travel all the way out there and l find that you've been lying to me, l'm going to find you and l'm going to take more than my money back.
ls that all right with you?
Yes, sir. All right, then.
nice luck to you. God bless. And to you, young man.
there's someone coming. Thank you, Mary.
good evening. Good evening.
my name's Daniel Plainview. This is my son, H. W.
are you hunting? Hunting for quail.
we're told there might be a good place.
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.
this is the Sunday ranch. You can camp here.
thank you. Do you have water? Yes.
we heard there was an earthquake up here a few days ago.
ls that right? Yes.
your family? Yeah, all fine. Thank you.
we have goat's milk, if you'd like. That would be fine.
now, if we set our tent away over there we'd be out of your way over there.
that's fine.
Ruth! Help these men and bring them some water.
No! H. W.
Mr. Plainview, would you like that milk now?
that would be fine. Thank you.
Mary! Bring them some milk.
my family will help you set up your tent.
no, please. We set ourselves on this camping trip.
we have to do the camping.
hurry up!
do you have bread? We have potatoes.
potatoes would be nice, thank you.
l'll have them boil you up some potatoes.
that's all right. l thought maybe we'd make a fire.
l wanted to work with my son on making a fire.
all right. My son, Eli, will bring you some wood.
thank you so much for your hospitality, Mr. Sunday.
Yes. And we'll be out of your way.
we're just hunting for quail. Yes.
l'm sorry we don't have any bread. No, no, no.
corn doesn't fill out in the hills here. lt's mostly rock.
we don't have room to raise the grain.
thank you, young lady.
my name is Eli.
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.
welcome.
H. W. Eli.
you're hunting quail? That's right.
we will bring dinner.
thank you. Thank you so much.
dad!
dad, look at my shoe.
that's earthquake oil. Set loose.
so...
so?
so, so.
lf there's anything here, we take it to the sea.
what we do is we build a pipeline to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula, it's about 100 miles, and we do a deal with Union Oil
this is what we do.
then we don't need the railroads and their shipping costs anymore.
you see?
Yeah.
you see that? Yeah.
then we're making money. We're making the real money.
what we should be making. Not just...
not just throwing it away on shipping costs.
otherwise, it's just mud.
how much are we going to pay them?
who's that?
the Sunday family.
l'm not going to give them oil prices.
l'll give them quail prices.
lf we could take a few minutes, there's something l'd very much like to talk with you about.
mother, would you take the girls outside, please?
l believe in plain speaking, so...
this is a beautiful ranch. l love hunting for quail.
my boy has been sick, you know.
he needs fresh air.
doctors all say he needs plentiful fresh air.
so, what would you say would be a fair price for this lot, Abel?
to buy this place? That's right.
take a moment.
l'm sorry. l don't know. Six dollars an acre.
six dollars? Thank you, Eli.
and then with the improvements to the ranch over the years at $500...
l'd like to offer you $3, 700 for this ranch.
that's $3, 700. No.
the Lord has sent this man here, Eli.
Yes, l believe He has.
my offer to you is $3, 700.
what is it that brought you here, sir?
the Good Lord's guidance.
now, of course, within that...
what about our oil?
...we're going to develop a lease.
what's that? What about our oil?
what about it?
we have oil here. That's worth something.
do you have someone who can drill for it?
do you think there's oil here? l know there is.
lt's very expensive to drill.
to get it up and out of the ground. You ever tried that before?
how much is it? Costly.
well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.
l believe that's called seepage.
doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath.
what would you give us for it? l don't know.
something you don't know. That's right.
what would you like, Eli?
ten thousand dollars.
for what?
for my church.
that's good.
that's a good one.
well...
lf we decide to drill for oil and if the well begins to produce, l'll give your church a $5, 000 signing bonus.
ten thousand.
do you want to find someone else that's going to come here and drill, Eli?
make the investment and do all the hard work that goes into it?
l can just as easily hunt for quail on another ranch as l can here, so...
though l'll happily be a supporter of your church for as long as l can.
for the bonus only.
now, as it happens, l do have some connections in the drilling business who might help get us started. How do you feel about this, Abel?
Yes. What Eli says.
well, good! Let's draw up some contracts and let's...
let's give it a try.
appreciate your help with this, Eli.
good afternoon. Good afternoon.
real estate? Yes.
Yes, l'd like to talk to you.
l'm looking for some land. l just bought the Sunday ranch.
and, well, where's the map?
where are the hills behind the Sunday ranch?
that's here. lt's the Bandy tract. He has over 600 acres.
bandy, 600.
what about this?
A. C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.
what's it held at? Six dollars an acre.
six.
what about this?
that's the Belvins, and that could be got, l'm sure.
can everything around here be got?
sure.
paul Sunday turned out to be a good friend of ours.
that's right.
well, you get here just as soon as you can. Bring Fred English.
good enough.
thank you, porter.
H. W. how are you? Fine, and you?
pretty good. Where's your dad? He's inside.
you fellas are a long way from Signal Hill.
Hello, Plainview. Hello, Gene.
good to see you. Charlie.
on your way somewhere else? Passing through. Looking around.
funny to see you. Funny, isn't it?
you boys are a regular family business.
you boys are a little late.
what did you find? l found some interesting prospects.
did you hear Standard bought up?
mostly in the north, so far. That's what l hear.
l'm gonna tell you, Gene, if you're gonna make a play, look east.
l'd rather it be you than someone else
this mud around here has been taken.
lt must be easy when you have such a cute face to carry around with you.
telling me how handsome my son is? Well, that l am.
that's very nice. Thank you. Good luck, Gene.
take care. Like l said, go east.
l'll be your lawyer if you need to draw up a contract.
make sure you don't get swindled, boy.
get half what your dad's making.
how's that?
what are those men doing?
they're just guys that are working for us.
they're just looking around.
how much money can we make?
l don't know. lt depends.
one thousand dollars?
Mary said that her father beats her if she doesn't pray.
Mary, she's the smaller one?
Yes, she is.
everyone here? Very successful.
But?
there were a few vacant lots and one holdout.
who? William Bandy.
...eight. Who's he?
he's an old man who homesteaded here.
lives with his grandson. He said he'd like to speak with you.
ls he here?
no, he'd like you to come visit with him.
he's boosting his price.
he said he'd like to speak with whoever is doing the buying.
well, let him wait. He'll come around. Let's go.
ladies and gentlemen?
ladies and gentlemen.
thank you so much for visiting with us this evening.
now, l've traveled across half our state to be here and to see about this land.
now, l dare say some of you might have heard some of the more extravagant rumors about what my plans are, so l just thought you'd like to hear it from me.
this is the face. lt's no great mystery.
l'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen, l have numerous concerns spread across this state.
l have many wells flowing at many thousand barrels per day, so l like to think of myself as an oilman.
as an oilman, l hope that you'll forgive just good oldfashioned plain speaking.
now, this work that we do is very much a family enterprise.
l work side by side with my wonderful son, H. W.
l think one or two of you might have met him already.
and l encourage my men to bring their families, as well.
of course, it makes for an ever so much more rewarding life for them.
family means children, and children means education.
so, wherever we set up camp, education is a necessity, and we're just so happy to take care of that.
so let's build a wonderful school in Little Boston.
these children are the future that we strive for, and so they should have the very best of things.
now, something else, and please don't be insulted if l speak about this. Bread.
let's talk about bread.
now, to my mind, it's an abomination to consider that any man, woman, or child in this magnificent country of ours should have to look upon a loaf of bread as a luxury.
we're going to dig water wells here, and water wells means irrigation.
lrrigation means cultivation.
we're going to raise crops here where before it just simply wasn't possible.
you're going to have more grain than you'll know what to do with, and bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am.
new roads, agriculture, employment, education.
these are just a few of the things we can offer you, and l assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that if we do find oil here, and l think there's a very good chance that we will, this community of yours will not only survive it will flourish.
l'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Yes?
will the new road lead to the church?
that'll be the first place that it leads. Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?
well, if anything comes up, l'm pretty easy to find.
you just come visit with me.
thank you so much for your time, and good night.
what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer!
what a privilege to carry...
just follow the new road right to the church.
the new road will lead you there.
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.
the Church of the Third Revelation welcomes you.
Hello, brother, my name is Eli.
the Church of the Third Revelation welcomes you.
just follow the new road right to the church.
Jesus knows our every weakness
take it to the Lord in prayer
are we weak and heavy laden
Cumbered with a load of care?
precious Savior still our refuge
take it to the Lord in prayer...
Daniel, may l speak with you? Yes, come in.
l'll bring them up when they arrive.
good morning. Good morning.
how is all the work coming?
everything's good.
all the men are provided for? Of course.
spirits seem high.
ls there anything that you need from me?
anything the church can do for you?
l don't believe so. No. Thank you.
l understand you've asked the people to gather around and watch the well begin tomorrow. ls that right?
that's right. l will bless the well.
before you begin, you should introduce me.
you'll see me walk up towards the oil well, and when l...
the derrick.
you'll see me walk up, and then you could say my name.
when you walk up?
Yes. You'll see me walk up, and then you could say, " The proud son of these hills who tended his Father's flock, "
and then you could say my name.
that's fine.
and what happens then?
well, then we start the drill.
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel, but an important one.
lt's just a few words. lt won't take long.
what time? What time's good for you, Eli?
4: 00. Well, let's make it 4: 00 then.
my thanks for your visit. Good day. Thank you.
afternoon, everyone.
come with me.
l thank you all so much for visiting with us at this time.
l've had the pleasure of meeting some of you and l hope very much in the months to come, l'll be able to visit with each and every one of you.
l'm better at digging holes in the ground than making speeches, so let's forget the speech for this evening, just make it a simple blessing.
you see, one man doesn't prospect from the ground.
lt takes a whole community of good people, such as yourselves, and this is good. We stay together.
we pray together, we work together, and if the Good Lord smiles kindly on our endeavor, we share in the wealth together.
now, before we spud in Mary's Well Number One, named for the lovely Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side, a proud daughter of these hills, l'd just like to say God bless these honest labors of ours, and, of course,
God bless you all.
Amen.
now go.
won't be a minute.
fast as you can, H. W.
are you ready to do this?
that's it, ladies and gentlemen!
al Rose has very generously provided some refreshments for this occasion out of his own pocket. Thank you, Al.
lf you'll all just care to help yourselves, l'll be back in a minute.
Mary.
Mary Sunday.
do you like your new dress? Yes. Thank you.
you're welcome. l thought you'd like it.
are you happy l came here? Yes.
your daddy doesn't hit you anymore, does he? Does he now?
better not, right?
l'll take care of you.
no more hitting, right? No more hitting. Now go.
go and play some more and don't come back.
Daniel?
lt's okay, H. W. Go back to sleep. Go on. Go back to sleep.
Daniel.
Daniel.
Daniel!
Daniel!
what?
lost a man down the well.
what man? Joe Gundha.
did l know him? No.
what happened?
pick it up.
set the brake.
tie it down. Tie it on.
shit!
God damn it. Where's the body?
they're fishing it out now. All right.
Where's the bit? lt's on the deck.
clean him up. Put some clothes on him.
and...
set up a tent.
anyone goes down into the cellar, you tell somebody. Yes?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
shut down till midday.
and l had a vision.
Yes, last night, l had a vision and l felt God's breath move through me.
and it rolled down into my stomach.
lt sloshed around.
and my stomach spoke in a whisper, not a shout, " Touch this woman with your hands and caress her. " Yes.
my dear Mrs. Hunter, you have arthritis, don't you?
Yes, l do, Eli.Yes.
the devil is in your hands, and l will suck it out.
now, l will not cast this ghost out with a fever for the new spirit inside me has shown me l have a new way to communicate.
lt is a gentle whisper.
get out of here, ghost.
get out of here, ghost.
get out.
get out of here, ghost.
get out of here, ghost.
...and enter this woman's body now.
get out of here, ghost.
get out of here. Don't you dare turn around and come back.
for if you do, all the armies of my boot will kick you in the teeth and you will be cast up and thrown in the dirt and thrust back to perdition!
and as long as l have teeth, l will bite you, and if l have no teeth, l will gum you!
and as long as l have fists, l will bash you!
now, get out of here, ghost! Get out of here, ghost!
get out of here, ghost!
and it left!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
praise the Lord and his holy days! Praise God!
Amen! Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, God.
my dear Mrs. Hunter.
dance with me.
thanks for coming. lt was a wonderful sermon.
will l see you tomorrow? Yes.
Eli.
had a tragedy at the well last night.
Yes, l heard.
Joe Gundha was a man of considerable faith.
so if you wish to say a few words, his burial is at noon tomorrow.
Daniel, this accident could have been avoided.
lt is terrible to think of that well working away out there...
these men work in 12hour shifts.
...unblessed. They need their rest.
lf they don't have it, they start to make stupid mistakes.
l've seen the men drinking
don't you think that has something to do with this?
we need these men well rested to bring in this well.
they can't get that if they're up here listening to your gospel, and then the well can't produce and blow gold all over the place.
l wish l had more time with Joe Gundha.
more could have been done.
then the well can't produce and blow gold all over the place.
now, would you see to it that his personal possessions find their way back to his family, please?
thank you.
heard you were planning some renovations.
Yes, our congregation is growing strongly.
we need more room.
that was one goddamn hell of a show.
we were happy to have you, Daniel.
gas, gas, gas!
lights out! Wait here. Wait here. Lights out!
put that fire out!
ls he hurt? H. W! Hand him down to me!
hand him down! Here.
got him? l've got him!
Oh, God.
come on.
open the door.
let go. There you go. You're safe. You're safe.
you're safe now. l got you here. You're safe. Let go, son.
tell me where it hurts. Tell me where it hurts. Tell me where...
did you see this? No.
tell me where it hurts.
where does it hurt you? Where does it hurt you?
l can't hear my voice.
were you hit in the head?
were you hit in the head? Tell me! You have to tell me if you were!
l can't hear my voice.
l have to go and deal with this now. You wait here for me.
you understand? You wait here for me.
l'll be back. l'll be back in a minute.
wait here. Don't leave!
l'm going to take care of you. Wait.
stay here, son. l'm going to fix this.
don't leave! You're going to be fine!
wait for me here!
hold him down. Hold him down. Don't leave!
got to break the cables, Daniel!
get me a hammer!
get me a hammer!
here you go.
get back!
Michael! Sir!
take Dave and two of the fellas, pick up some hoses...
Billy, protect the roof. Don't wait before it gets too hot.
what are you looking so miserable about?
there's a whole ocean of oil under our feet!
no one can get at it except for me.
H. W. okay?
no, he isn't.
where is he? Mess room.
that's enough now. That's enough, H. W. That's enough.
do you hear me? Can you hear me in there?
that's enough.
grab his legs. l have his legs.
no. Nope. No, lad.
give me that.
steady. That's it.
easy, boy. Easy. Soon be over.
Yeah, and that's good. Now the other side. Turn him over.
almost done.
that's it.
come here. lt's over. lt's over.
who do we know in San Francisco or Los Angeles, who could work with...
you know, we could... Someone, a teacher for H. W.
how could you figure out that?
now, call... God damn it
God damn it, what's his name?
Bob Brody in San Francisco?
call Bob Brody and get someone down here.
l'll do it right away.
when do we get our money, Daniel?
aren't you a healer? And a vessel for the Holy Spirit?
when are you coming over and make my son hear again?
can't you do that?
lf you had let me bless the well, this wouldn't have happened.
Daniel. You shouldn't have done that.
you owe the Church of the Third Revelation $5, 000
as part of the arrangement that we made!
don't even try it, you little runt! You splash around in here.
that's it, that's it.
l'm going to bury you underground, Eli.
l'm going to bury you underground.
you are a stupid man, Abel.
you've let someone come in here and walk all over us.
you let him in and do his work here, and you are a stupid man for what we could have had.
l followed his word, Eli. l tried.
you didn't do anything but sit down.
you're lazy, and you're stupid.
do you think God is going to save you for being stupid?
he doesn't save stupid people, Abel.
l will tear you apart for what you've done, you stupid man!
how did he come here? Do you really know? l know!
son, don't do this, please! Be quiet!
shut your mouth, Abel! lt was your stupid son!
lt was Paul who told him to come here. l know it.
he went to him and he said, " My stupid, weak father will give away his lots.
"go and take him. " And you let it happen.
a stupid father to a stupid son.
get out of there!
can l help you?
Daniel?
who's that? My name is Henry.
yeah?
l'm Henry.
what can l do for you?
l'm Henry Plainview. l'm from Fond du Lac.
l'm your brother, from another mother.
ernest is my father.
who are you?
Henry.
Mary Branch? ls that your mother? Yes, sir, that's right.
l read about your gusher in the paper, about your success.
you heard about my strike? You just show up?
our father's dead.
ernest died, l heard. l wanted to find you.
when?
three months ago. l got a letter from Annabelle.
my sister, Annabelle?
where is she? Still at home. Fond du Lac.
you came all the way from Wisconsin to tell me this?
l'm coming from New Mexico. l've been there.
l came to find you.
did you know about me?
do you have identification?
do you have this letter?
where are you coming from? From New Mexico.
Yes, l know, but from where?
silver City. l've been there for two years.
l was trying drilling of my own for years.
getting leases in Texas. Louisiana. Anything that produced?
no. Not like your success, no.
are you married? - No.
l spent time in jail. l had a stretch of very bad time.
l had nothing. l was picked up in Louisiana.
l worked on a chain gang for six months building roads.
that was a very hard time.
are you married?
what were you in jail for?
believe it or not, for all the terrible things l've gotten myself into, when they picked me up, l hadn't done anything.
but l've done my share of things that shouldn't be talked about.
drink it. Drink it!
come on.
so...
what do you want, Henry?
nothing.
lf you can spare something, l can work for you in any way.
l know l'll keep moving, before long, to get back to Fond du Lac.
do you have any money? Some.
not much. - Just answer me directly.
you say " nothing, " then you say you'd like to stay and work.
and it's better, l'd just like to hear you say you'd like to be here.
l'd like to be here.
l'm a good worker. l worked cable tool rigs, built railroads.
l won't need any favors.
good.
what did my mother know?
l don't know if she knew and looked the other way, if she never knew.
why did you leave?
l know you didn't get on with our father.
l worked for Geological Survey and went to Kansas.
l couldn't stay there. l just couldn't.
l don't like to explain myself.
are you an angry man, Henry? About what?
are you envious? Do you get envious?
l don't think so, no.
l have a competition in me.
l want no one else to succeed.
l hate most people.
that part of me is gone.
working and not succeeding, all my failures have left me...
l just don't care.
well, if it's in me, it's in you.
there are times when l look at people and l see nothing worth liking.
l want to earn enough money l can get away from everyone.
what will you do about your boy?
l don't know.
maybe it'll change.
does your sound come back to you? l don't know. Maybe no one knows that.
doctor might not know that. Where's his mother?
l don't want to talk about those things.
l see the worst in people, Henry.
l don't need to look past seeing them to get all l need.
l've built up my hatreds over the years, little by little.
having you here gives me a second breath of life.
l can't keep doing this on my own with these people.
Daniel! Daniel, wake up! Daniel!
just have to go and have a word with the conductor.
l'll be right back.
you stay here. You understand? You stay here.
l'll be right back.
No! No!
No!
Tilford! Plainview.
this is my brother, Henry Plainview from Fond du Lac.
H. M. Tilford. Pleasure.
Henry Plainview. J. J. Carter.
so...
shall we? - Yes.
how's your boy?
thank you for asking. - ls there anything we can do?
thanks for asking is enough.
so what are your plans?
ls this about buying up my tracts here?
Yes.
the cable was about my Coyote Hills lease.
we'd like that, too . - What's your offer on Coyote Hills?
we'll offer 150, 000 for full title. That's a deal. What's next?
you have 1 1 , 000 acres in Little Boston.
you have one proven well that was damaged...- l have three wells proven.
you haven't been paying attention. That's three proven wells.
we'll make you a millionaire while you're sitting here from one minute to the next.
and what else would l do with myself?
are you asking me? - What else would l do with myself?
take care of your son.
l don't know what you would do.
lf you were me and Standard offered to buy what you had for a million dollars, why? So, why?
you know why.
Yeah, you fellas should just scratch around in the dirt and find it like the rest of us, instead of buying up someone else's hard work.
l've scratched around the dirt, son.
you going to change your shipping costs?
we don't dictate shipping costs. That's railroad business.
you don't own the railroads?
course you do. Of course you do.
where you going to put it all?
where?
build a pipeline? Make a deal with Union Oil? Be my guest.
but if you can't pull it off, you've got an ocean of oil under your feet with nowhere to go.
why not turn it over to us? We'll make you rich.
you spend time with your boy.
lt's a great discovery.
now, let us help you.
did you just tell me how to run my family?
lt might be more important now that you've proven the field and we're offering to buy you out.
one night l'm going to come to you, inside of your house, or wherever you're sleeping, and l'm going to cut your throat.
what?
what are you talking about? Have you gone crazy?
did you hear what l said?- l heard what you said, why did you say it?
you don't tell me about my son.
why are you acting insane and threatening to cut my throat?
you don't tell me about my son.
l'm not telling you anything!
l'm asking you to be reasonable.
lf l've offended you, l apologize.
you'll see what l can do.
this parcel here is the 3, 000acre ranch owned by B. L. Harper.
this is San Luis Obispo County land.
and from here to the coast, it's all Union Oil.
what's this? Why don't l own this?
why don't l own this?
that's the Bandy tract.
he was the holdout, when we were doing the buying.
he had hoped to speak with you.
can't you just build the pipeline around this tract?
can l build around 50 miles of Tehachapi mountains?
don't be thick in front of me, Al.
l can go to him again.
no, l'll go and talk to the man.
l'll talk to him. Show you how it's done.
all right. Pack it up, Henry.
how big is his room?- He's sharing with another boy.
who?- An older boy. About 12.
he's been there for a year. Named Ballard.
how big is the room?- lt's a fair size. Got enough space.
are you taking Henry with you to meet Union Oil?
are you the son of William Bandy?
grandson.
ls he here?- No, he's out.
where is he?
told you, he's out. Now, what do you want?
l'm Daniel Plainview.
l want to talk with him about his property.
about what?- l believe l'll talk with him about that.
you're that oilman, aren't you? That's right.
we don't want you drilling out here.
l don't want it either. Now, when will he be back?
few days.
tell him l'd like to speak with him. Not about drilling.
and l'll be back in a week.
put that in a glass case.
here's to Union Oil.
hundred miles of pipeline, and all the independent producers of this great state.
Cheers.
there's that house in Fond du Lac that John Hollister built. Do you remember it?
l thought as a boy that was the most beautiful house l'd ever seen, and l wanted it.
l wanted to live in it.
and eat in it.
and clean it.
and even as a boy, l wanted to have children to run around in it.
you can have anything you'd like now
Daniel.
and you should.
where are you going to build it? Here, maybe. Near the ocean.
would you make it look like that house?
l think if l saw that house now, it'd make me sick.
we can eat and get some women.
take them to the Peachtree dance.
l say get liquored up and take them to the Peachtree dance.
Yeah.
can l have some money, please?
can l have some money, please?
l want you to tell me something.
what?
what's the name of the farm next to the Hill House?
what was the name of the farm next to the Hill House?
l can't remember... - Who are you?
l'll leave, Daniel.
who are you?
l'm no one.
just let me get up and go.
do l have a brother?
l met a man in King City who said he was your brother.
we were friends for months.
working in King City.
and he wanted to make his way to you, Daniel.
we didn't have any money.
he died of tuberculosis.
he wasn't harmed.
wasn't killed, nothing bad.
but he told me about you, and l just took his story, used his diary.
Daniel.
Daniel, l'm your friend.
l'm not trying to hurt you.
never.
just survive.
No!
who is it?
l'm Bandy.
Yes. Yes.
william Bandy.
Yeah, l'd like to lease your land.
l had asked for you to come and talk to me before.
when you were leasing land.
that's right, yes.
my boy's been very sick, you know.
this was before your boy got sick.
now, l know that you would like to build a pipeline through my property.
ls that right, what l've heard? lt's absolutely right. And, well...
eight inch pipe. lt could be buried with your consent.
l guarantee you absolutely no disruption...
God.
God has told me what you must do.
and what is that?
you should be washed in the blood of Jesus Christ.
but l am.
l have been washed, Mr. Bandy. l have been.
lt's your only way to salvation.
and your only way for what you want.
you can take it at the Church of the Third Revelation.
l'll pay you $3, 000.
l'd like you to be part of our church.
l'll pay you $5, 000.
be baptized.
be forgiven for the sin that you've done.
what sin are you referring to, Mr. Bandy?
my sin of drilling?
l truly wish everyone could be saved, don't you?
Yes.
l am afraid that's just not the case.
the doctrine of universal salvation is a lie, is it not?
lt's a lie. - lt's a lie.
l wish everyone could be saved but they won't. No, they won't.
you will never be saved if you...
reject the blood.
good.
now, is there a sinner here looking for salvation?
a new member?
l'll ask it again.
ls there a sinner here looking for God?
Yes.
allow me.
thank you for coming, brother Daniel.
thank you, Eli.
we have a sinner with us here who wishes for salvation!
Daniel, are you a sinner? - Yes.
the Lord can't hear you, Daniel.
say it to him. Go ahead and speak to him. lt's all right.
Yes. Down on your knees.
pray to him.
look up to the sky and say it.
what do you want me to say?
Daniel, you've come here and you've brought good and wealth, but you have also brought your bad habits as a backslider.
you've lusted after women, and you have abandoned your child.
your child, that you raised, you have abandoned all because he was sick and you have sinned.
so say it now. l am a sinner.
l am a sinner. - Say it louder.
l am a sinner. l am a sinner.
louder, Daniel! l am a sinner!
l am a sinner. l am sorry, Lord.
l am sorry, Lord. l want the blood.
l want the blood. You have abandoned your child.
l have abandoned my child.
l will never backslide. l will never backslide.
l was lost, but now l am found.
l was lost, but now l'm found.
l have abandoned my child.
say it. Say it.
l abandoned my child. Say it louder. Say it louder!
l've abandoned my child!
l've abandoned my child!
l've abandoned my boy!
now beg for the blood!
just give me the blood, Eli. Let me get out of here.
give me the blood, Lord, and let me get away!
do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
Yes, l do. Get out of here, devil!
out, devil! Out, sin!
let me feel the power of the Lord, Eli. Do you accept the Church of the Third Revelation as your spiritual guide?
get out of here, ghost! Where is your Lord, Eli?
get out! Go back where you belong!
where is he? There he is!
do you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior?
Yes, l do.
would you be free from the burden of sin?
there's power in the blood
power in the blood
would you o'er evil a victory win?
there's a pipeline.
there's wonderful power in the blood
there is power, power wonder-working power ln the blood of the Lamb
praise the Lord!
welcome to the fold, brother Plainview.
welcome, brother Daniel. God bless you.
God bless you.
Hallelujah. Amen.
welcome home, brother.
that's enough. That's enough, now.
he must take the spirit in on his own.
we have a new member.
Yes, brother. Hallelujah.
Hallelujah. Amen.
my sweet Mary. Mr. Plainview has been generous enough to make a $5, 000 donation to the church which we are still waiting for.
that does me good. That does me good.
welcome home, son.
welcome home, son.
this here's George Reynolds. Teacher from the deaf school.
Mr. Plainview. Fletcher.
you're too heavy for me.
do you want to get something to eat?
that's the pipeline, see? All the way to the sea.
come here.
l love you, son.
let's take a look at you.
all right. That's it, that's it. That's it.
let's get some decent food inside of you.
that's all we need here is a good, strong, expensive meal.
you hungry?
waiter? Yes, sir.
two steaks, a whiskey, and water for him.
and goat's milk. Very good, sir.
we're going to have this teacher help you.
he's going to help take care of all of this. Understand?
cause l need you. Need your help.
got everything we need now to build this company. Come here.
good afternoon.
how are you doing? lt's nice to see you again.
we need four. l'll have them right up.
good afternoon, Daniel. Tilford.
good afternoon.
Hello! H. M. Tilford! You don't have to shout.
pleasure.
lt's good to be in Little B.
could use some rain out here. Yeah, we could.
there we go. R. J. how's the London broil?
believe we ordered these drinks before those people.
R. J. tell us. How's the London broil?
excuse me, gentlemen. Sorry.
l am sorry about that, sir. l'll have your steaks right out.
so that green turtle soup is fantastic. ls it?
lt's delicious.
sounds good to me.
so Standard offered us a million dollars for the Little Boston leases.
l told H. M. Tilford where he could shove that.
and we made a deal with Union! On the pipeline!
and that whole ocean of oil underneath our fields.
...$150, 000. Yes.
we needed the money to drill.
who is this guy? l go out to meet him.
he's getting oil on the property. We're trying to make a claim on it.
offered him a million dollars.
turned us down flat. Well, l'm hungry.
orange fritters, mashed potatoes, green peas.
all the way around? All right.
hold on.
l want you to look over there.
Daniel, let me introduce...
look over there. You see?
that's my son. See him?
Yes. Do you see?
l see him.
you don't tell me how to raise my family.
l told you not to tell me how to raise my family.
Daniel...
so what do you see?
l'm very happy for you that the deal...
Yes, l made a deal with Union.
my son is happy. He's safe. Congratulations.
l'm taking care of him now, so... Excellent.
you look like a fool, don't you, Tilford?
Yes. Yes.
Yes, you do.
excuse me, gentlemen.
excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse him, gentlemen.
l told you what l was going to do.
my son.
Mr. Sunday, l understand that you're leaving our fair community.
Yes, l'm going on a mission. Where you going?
Oildale, Taft, and then on to Bakersfield.
well, l want you to know...
three quarters of an hour.
...you done a great job for us.
thank you. You will be in my prayers. l thank you very much.
union Oil Company, Santa Paula, California.
the woman saith unto him, 'Sir, give me this water " 'and l shall thirst not, neither come hither to draw. " '
come in, come in.
can we be alone?
this is my closest associate. He hears everything.
l'd prefer to speak to you in private. You can't speak.
so why don't you flap your hands about and have what's his name tell me where you've been.
or do you think l don't know?
this is hard for me to say.
l'll tell you first, l love you very much.
l've learned to love what l do because of you.
l'm leaving here.
l'm going to Mexico.
l'm taking Mary, and l'm going to Mexico.
l miss working outside.
l miss the fields.
lt'll only be for a time, for me to do my own drilling and start my own company.
lt's time to make a change.
this makes you my competitor.
no. No, it's not like that. lt is like that, boy.
your own company, huh?
that's right.
ln Mexico?
Yes.
you are making such a misstep. So, what are you doing?
l know you and l have disagreed over many things.
l'd rather keep you as my father than my partner.
then say it.
lf you've got something to say to me, then say it.
l'd like to hear you speak instead of your little dog.
l'm going to Mexico with my wife.
l'm going away from you.
that wasn't so hard, was it?
killing us with what you're doing.
you're killing my image of you as my son.
you are stubborn. You won't listen.
you're not my son.
please don't say that. l know you don't mean it.
lt's the truth. You're not my son. You never have been.
you're an orphan!
did you ever hear that word?
tell him what l said.
you operated here today like one.
l should have seen this coming.
l should have known that, under this all, these past years you've been building new hate for me, piece by piece.
l don't even know who you are because you have none of me in you.
you're someone else's.
this anger. Your maliciousness.
backwards dealings with me.
you're an orphan from a basket in the middle of the desert.
and l took you for no other reason than l needed a sweet face to buy land.
did you get that?
so now you know.
look at me! You're lower than a bastard.
you have none of me in you.
you're just a bastard from a basket.
l thank God l have none of you in me.
not my son. Just a little piece of competition.
bastard from a basket.
bastard from a basket!
you're a bastard from a basket!
get up, Mr. Daniel.
Mr. Daniel.
Mr. Daniel, you've got a visitor.
wake up, Mr. Daniel.
sir?
you can leave us now.
Daniel.
Daniel.
Daniel Plainview, the house is on fire!
brother Daniel, it's Eli.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.
l'll make us a drink.
your home is a miracle.
lt's beautiful.
lt's beautiful.
God bless it.
l've been spreading his word far and wide.
far and wide.
so much travel for Him.
l've been working in radio.
Yes, so much... So much has been happening.
to be here and find you and see you well is wonderful.
and we have a chance to catch up.
no. Thank you so much.
my brother.
Daniel, my brother by marriage.
we're such old friends. So much time.
things go up, things go down, but at least the Lord is always around.
we've seen ups and downs, haven't we?
are things down for you right now, Eli?
no. No.
but l do come with some sad news.
perhaps you remember Mr. Bandy?
Mr. Bandy has passed on to the Lord.
he lived to be 99 years old, God bless him.
Mr. Bandy has a grandson. Have you met his grandson, William?
william Bandy is one of the finest members we have at the Church of the Third Revelation.
he's eager to come to Hollywood to be in movies.
he is very goodlooking.
and l do think he will have success. That's wonderful.
would you like me to speak with him?
Daniel, l'm asking if you'd like to have business with the Church of the Third Revelation in developing this lease on young Bandy's 1 , 000acre tract.
l'm offering you to drill on one of the great undeveloped fields of Little Boston.
l'd be happy to work with you. You would?
Yes, yes, of course. That's wonderful.
but there is one condition for this work.
all right.
l'd like you to tell me that you are a false prophet.
l'd like you to tell me that you are, and have been a false prophet.
and that God is a superstition.
but that's a lie.
lt's a lie. l cannot say it.
when can we begin to drill? Very soon.
how long will it take to bring in the well?
lt shouldn't take long.
l would like a $100, 000 signing bonus, plus the five that is owed to me with interest.
that's only fair.
l am a false prophet, and God is a superstition.
lf that's what you believe, then l will say it.
say it like you mean it. Daniel.
say it like it's your sermon.
don't smile.
l am a false prophet.
God is a superstition. Why don't you stand up?
put your glass down.
l am a false prophet.
God is a superstition. Eli, stop.
just imagine this is your church here and you have a full congregation, so...
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.
say it again.
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.
they can't hear you at the back.
l am a false prophet. God is a superstition.
say it again.
l am a false prophet! God is a superstition!
say it again.
l am a false prophet! God is a superstition!
those areas have been drilled.
what?
those areas, they've been drilled.
no, they haven't. Yes, it's...
lt's called drainage, Eli.
see, l own everything around it, so, of course, l get what's underneath it.
but there are no derricks there.
this is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?
do you understand, Eli?
that's more to the point. Do you understand?
l drink your water. l drink it up every day.
l drink the blood of Lamb from Bandy's tract.
you can sit down again.
Daniel.
Daniel.
please.
l am in desperate times. l know.
l need a friend. Yes. Of course, you do.
l've sinned.
l need help. l'm a sinner.
l've let the devil grab hold of me in ways l never imagined.
l'm so full of sin.
the Lord sometimes challenges us, doesn't He, Eli?
Yes, he does, Daniel. Yes, He does.
Yes, He does!
Yes, He does!
he's completely failed to alert me to the recent panic in our economy.
and this... Oh, dear.
l must have this, Daniel. l must, l must, l must have this.
my investments have...
Daniel, l won't bore you, but if l could grab the Lord's hand for help l would, but he does these things all the time.
these mysteries that he presents, and while we wait...
while we wait for his word!
because you're not the chosen brother, Eli.
because you're not the chosen brother, Eli.
it was Paul who was chosen.
he found me and told me about your land.
you're just a fool.
why are you talking about Paul?
l did what your brother couldn't.
don't say this to me.
l broke you and l beat you.
lt was Paul told me about you.
he's the prophet. He's the smart one.
he knew what was there and he found me to take it out of the ground.
know what the funny thing is? Listen, listen.
l paid him $10, 000 cash in hand. Just like that.
he has his own company now. Prosperous little business.
three wells producing, $5, 000 a week.
stop crying, you sniveling ass. Stop your nonsense.
you're just the afterbirth, Eli. No.
that slithered out on your mother's filth.
no.
they should've put you in a glass jar on the mantelpiece.
where were you when Paul was suckling at his mother's teat?
where were you?
who was nursing you, poor Eli? One of Bandy's sows?
that land has been had.
nothing you can do about it. lt's gone.
lf you would just take this lease... You lose.
Drainage!
drainage, Eli, you boy.
drained dry. l'm so sorry.
lf you have a milkshake and l have a milkshake, and l have a straw, there it is.
that's the straw, you see?
watch it.
now my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake.
l drink your milkshake!
l drink it up! Don't bully me, Daniel.
did you think your song and dance and your superstition would help you, Eli?
l am the Third Revelation. l am who the Lord has chosen.
Daniel! Because l'm smarter than you!
l'm older!
l'm your old friend, Daniel!
l'm not a false prophet... Help me! Help me!
...you sniveling boy!
l am the Third Revelation! l am the Third Revelation!
l told you l would eat you. We're family!
l told you l would eat you up!
we're brothers! We're brothers!
Daniel, please forgive me. l beg you.
that's it. That's it.
Mr. Daniel?
l'm finished.
I'm refreshed.
I'm refreshing.
welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.
and I'm Anne Howard. - Good stuff today.
we're going to be busy. - We've got pop superstar Elton John.
he's going to be with us.
and so, too, will best-selling author Al Franken.
along with some super-smart fourth graders...
with a great idea for getting schoolbooks to kids who really need them.
but here's an idea whose time has come.
why don't we just start with...
...and fill the tart shell.
bryant, you put some ice cream on our angel food cake...
how much do you want? - As much as you like.
what are you laughing about? This is Baked Alaska.
this is supposed to be low-fat. - It is!
did they call?
someone from the show. The Gumbel show. They didn't call?
are you sure?
once again, we're out of time. - Thank you. Already?
we still got lots more ahead this morning. We're going to be back...
what's up, dude? - Next person in line.
what's up?
Hey, can I get your autograph? - Next in line.
I'm not who you think I am, so...
you're not the weather guy?
Dan Spritz?
Dave Spritz.
I'm not Dave Spritz, no. But I hear that a lot.
you don't have to be a dick.
look, can you just... All right, I'm just waiting in line.
bro, I can read your vehicle registration form.
so, whatever.
can you...
all right, can you give me a break? I just wanted to wait in line.
you're on TV, bro.
you're on TV.
you're on TV, bro. - So what? You keep saying that.
so you're on TV, bro.
go work in a bank or something...
if you don't wanna be cool to people.
whatever. Just... Can you get out of my face?
can you get out of my face?
asshole. - You want to say that to my face?
I thought you wanted me to get out of your face.
people recognize me sometimes.
some are dicks.
this is the same system that created those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.
it's meant some slightly warmer weather...
I should cool out a little, I guess.
I mean, I'm not just this two-dimensional guy they recognize.
I do have a relationship to them.
I let them know what they have to deal with.
but listen, these warmer temperatures are not going to last.
this wind system will keep pushing colder air across the Midwest...
I guess that's why they think they know me.
but they don't, really.
...our Spritz Nipper of the week with a high of just 24.
I'm not a hill of beans.
I have a plan.
okay, see you then.
what's this afternoon? - You're picking up Shelly.
where? - Chicago Dance.
then you're taking your dad to Northwestern.
at 3: 00?
do you have that Hello America stuff?
the letter? - Yeah.
you have Mike, too. 5: 30 at the Norris house.
okay.
do they have my cell phone?
well, they should have all the numbers in case.
and am I supposed to call that guy Dersen?
didn't he want me to call to touch base?
okay.
dad, can we stop here? - What for?
I need a notebook for school.
I'll just walk home.
okay.
can I have some money? - You don't have any?
no.
you're 12 years old.
you shouldn't be walking around without money, okay, Shelly?
you're not a kid.
how's your mom doing? - She's good.
can I have a pack of Lights?
regulars? - The 100s.
strikes?
how's Shelly?
she's doing great.
little angel. - Yeah.
she's doing great.
who's an angel? - Shelly.
Shelly is grossly overweight and unhappy.
I'm concerned about her, as I am Michael.
David. - Yeah, Dad.
robert Spritzel?
would you get me a paper for the way back, Son? - Yeah.
fifteen minutes?
Yes. I'll see you then.
fuck.
it's getting cold. - Yeah.
what's the Nipper this week? - Thursday.
thursday's the Nipper? All right.
here.
Yeah, can I get some change?
not really.
can I just get some quarters? I just need a quarter for a paper.
not really.
all right. I'll get something then.
small coffee.
it's 80 cents.
no, it says $0. 72.
after the whole everything, it's $0. 80.
Where's the paper, David?
I didn't have enough money.
you bought a coffee.
what? - You bought a coffee.
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have enough money after.
what?
I didn't have enough money after I bought the coffee, so...
you should carry more than $1, David.
you're a grown man.
let me just move this letter from Hello America.
my father is Robert King Spritzel.
he won the National Book Award when he was 28.
and the Pulitzer when he was 33.
president Carter called him a national treasure.
they played racquetball in a regular game.
he was a great writer.
but what was the cost?
did he neglect his family?
no, he didn't.
he was a fine father.
more than that, really.
it's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.
she should find another interest that would be more rewarding to her that she can take more from, David.
we've talked about that. - Well, you should do something, Son.
we've tried a couple things. We'll keep trying, so...
how's Michael?
I think that was an overreaction on Noreen's part.
I don't think he has a problem with pot.
let's hope.
how's the weather business?
last September...
I had encouraged Shelly to explore some other activities and interests.
she picked archery.
so I took her to an archery range in Bolingbrook.
it was a 90-minute drive.
we purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...
and a leather wrist/forearm guard.
okay, we'll take that.
and private lessons.
all right, Shelly.
you take that one...
all right. Okay, just remember...
pull it straight back, parallel to your ear, okay?
you can do it, Shelly.
we purchased a five-pack lesson plan.
we haven't been back.
Hello?
can you pick up Mike at the mall on North?
I thought he was at a friend's house. Paul Norris.
they went to the mall. He just called me.
he finished his rehab. - Okay.
that's one of my counselors. - In your program?
don Boden. He's pretty nice.
he swears all the time, though. - Swears?
Yeah. To relate, I guess. But he's pretty nice.
Hey, Don.
what are you guys doing? - Looking for clothes.
you're just looking for clothes.
Yeah. - That's great.
I'm looking for clothes.
okay.
this is Paul. - What's up?
Hey.
it's cold today.
Yeah. - Yeah, no kidding.
what is it, like, 20 or something?
Yeah, like 22.
Yeah. Fuck.
Yeah.
Hey.
Yeah, I like this. - It's good-looking.
Yeah, I've been looking for something like this.
Chuck it in here.
what? - Chuck it in.
I'm loading up. I got a discount card. I'll get it for you.
that's all right. - Mike, big deal.
I can get it. - Bro, I got a serious discount.
it's gonna cost, like, $7.
I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you. - You, too.
that's my dad. I'll see you later.
sure. I'll catch you later.
who's that? - Don Boden.
who's Don Boden? - He's one of my counselors.
Oh.
that's a nice sweater. - Thanks.
I'll walk you up.
Hi.
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.
Hey, how was your thing? - It was good.
I'll see you, Dad. - Okay, Mike.
I think he's gonna be okay. - Well, we'll see.
what's new?
nothing much.
I got a feeler from Hello America.
what? - I got a feeler.
dales is leaving it. I might get called to audition.
new York.
if I get called. - That's good.
what about the kids?
it's just a shot in the dark, that's all.
well, thanks for getting Mike.
I had to take my dad to Northwestern for a test...
so I was right there, anyway.
Oh, is he okay? - I think so. It was just a test.
Noreen!
are you okay?
Yeah.
fuck! What are you doing?
I was just... You turned into it.
I think you cracked the glass.
so do you have everything you need?
Yeah, we got everything.
we'll pare it down to three applicants after we watch the tapes.
we'll call if you're one, Dave. - Okay, Mark.
it's nice to make your acquaintance.
you, too. Take care. - Hey, weatherman!
all right. Bye.
fuck!
fuck.
David?
Hey.
what happened? - I got hit with a Frosty.
Why? - What?
why did you get hit with a Frosty? What is a Frosty?
a Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.
why would someone throw a shake at you?
that happens sometimes. - People throw shakes at you?
stuff. People throw stuff at me sometimes...
if they don't like me, or something. - They don't know you.
from TV.
but you just read the weather.
well, I predict it.
you don't have a degree in meteorology.
I make suppositions, or I...
what are you doing?
I walked over. - You walked? It's freezing.
I have lymphoma, David.
what?
I have lymphoma.
doctor Pritch called. - What?
I was having tremors. That's the reason that I went in.
Pritch read my scans.
what's the prognosis? - Well, it's not good.
we'll talk about it this week. I wanted to tell you.
Yeah.
I'll call you after I've talked to Pritch again.
I'll drive you home.
I like the fresh air.
well, I'll walk back with you. - No, that's okay.
okay.
every couple months, someone throws something at me...
a shake, a burrito once.
Why? My name, partly, I guess.
I changed it for professional reasons.
my first station manager suggested it.
he said it sounded refreshing and that they wanted that quality.
that may be true, but it's also annoying. I know that.
what kind of name is Spritz?
it's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.
he's bullshit.
well, I like him. He's handsome.
he's an asshole.
I don't like his face.
his asshole face.
the other thing, my job is very easy.
two hours a day, basically reading prompts.
I make $240, 000 a year...
plus appearances...
which are, you know, not comfortable for me...
but lucrative.
four score and seven years ago...
our fathers brought forth, on this continent...
also, it makes other things easy, being on TV.
everything's easy.
Yeah!
I receive a large reward for pretty much zero effort and contribution.
the shakes and stuff are a reaction to that, I think.
what must you think of me?
your family-leaver.
your non-meteorologist, yet weatherman...
frosty-taking, fuck-happy son.
don't die yet, Robert. Give me time to get it together.
give me a little while.
let me get the Hello America job. I can get it together.
two for High Water.
I got mine, Don. - No, it's cool. I got it.
Thanks.
Tricia's a bitch.
she's a little cunt.
I hate that little cunt.
I'd like to burn her.
Hi.
Hi.
today's the company party. I thought I'd take the kids.
Oh.
well, Mike is out.
Shelly's home? - She's walking Jackson.
where do you want to take them? - The rink. WCH.
Hey.
Hey.
what?
Dave.
Hey, Tim.
I didn't know you were coming. - I always come to these when I can.
I have some time this week if you want to go back up to Bolingbrook.
what's in Bolingbrook? - Sportsman's. The archery range.
okay. - Okay? You wanna go?
okay, I remember it.
well, do you wanna go back up?
sometimes.
what's gonna happen?
what?
what are we gonna do here?
great stuff.
ladies and gentlemen, on your marks!
let's go team Spritz!
get set!
go!
go! Go! Go!
just keep up, Shell. Come on. - I'm trying to.
we should finish.
we're last. We're way last.
there's a lesson here. Let's finish.
I'm hurt.
hon, you can do it. You can finish. Okay?
I don't want you to quit. It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?
all right.
let's go.
that's my girl. That's it.
good. I'm proud of you.
Yay! That was great!
hon. Hon, you okay?
you shouldn't have made me finish!
that was like 100 yards you made me go.
I'm not a football-jocker.
what happened?
just... We got tangled up in a sack.
what happened? - She tore her ACL.
these fucking crutches are too long!
what did you say? - Shelly!
well, what were you doing? - It was a picnic.
and she tore something? - ACL. MCL.
which?
both.
Dave! - Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!
it was a fucking potato-sack race!
that's where she got it. - What?
"fucking" this. "Fucking" that.
no, I never said that around her.
you don't know you have, Dave, because you don't pay attention!
fuck that.
what?
just fuck that, Noreen. You know... - Dave.
what? - Step back.
step back? - Step back.
what are you talking about, Russ?
RUSS... - Step back right now.
fuck you, right now. - Fuck you, Spritz.
fuck you, fat asshole!
dildo!
David, what are you doing?
I'm talking to my wife! I'm talking to Noreen...
and this clown, whose business this isn't.
you call me a dildo, it is my business, Spritz.
you are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!
stop, Son.
would you?
why don't you go?
why are you here? Are you okay?
I came to talk to Noreen.
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.
Dave, what's going on, Son? - It's nothing. Just...
why are you here, anyway?
I came to talk to Noreen about an issue concerning Shelly.
well, you can talk to me. I'm her parent, too. So? What?
Shelly dresses in clothing not appropriate for her...
clinging stuff.
all kids wear... Dad, it's a different generation.
they call her camel toe.
what? - Are you aware of that?
what?
that her colleagues call her camel toe.
what are you talking about?
it means the crease in her vagina that they can discern through her clothing.
what? - Camel toe.
Yeah, I heard you. I mean, how do you know they do that?
I heard it.
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday, heard taunting, the older boys calling it.
you might have heard wrong. - No, I heard camel...
okay, okay, look. I'll deal.
I want to get her through this ACL thing.
I'm gonna take her shooting.
I'm gonna reapply her there.
I'm gonna get her talking to me. I'm gonna get to her...
and I'm gonna work it out.
a camel toe is pretty much what Robert said it was.
it's basically just when you can make out more than you should.
but it's the kind of thing...
she's 12, you know?
if you're around and paying attention, you catch it...
then name-calling doesn't start, and maybe smoking doesn't start.
and maybe she can just stay a happy kid for a couple more years.
she shouldn't be unhappy.
fuck. What did she ever do to anybody? Shelly.
hello. - Hey.
Hey.
listen.
Noreen, I was thinking...
this pushing and pulling，the tug-of-war we do sometimes...
it's not good for the kids.
it's not.
Noreen, let's see somebody. Work it out. Let's...
fuck! - Asshole!
are you okay?
I got hit with a pop! - What?
a fucking...
a Big Gulp.
man. - Are you okay? Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...
what I was saying...
see somebody?
we're going to begin with some trust-building exercises.
the Buddy Drop. Up on your feet. Let's go.
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.
now, Noreen, you're just gonna let yourself go...
and Dave is gonna catch you.
just go back? - Yeah. Cross your arms up front.
now? - Whenever you're ready.
okay.
good. Very good.
all right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.
okay.
now I want you to name something...
that you did that affected your partner...
and that you're not proud of.
I had this thing with porno on the computer, sort of.
I got a little preoccupied...
actually, I want you to write it down, not say it.
okay.
I want you to put it on the paper that you got for a reason.
okay.
now make sure it's something the other person doesn't know about...
that they don't know.
all right.
then you are going to give it to the other person...
and the other person is never going to look at it.
ever.
that's trust.
what's up?
I thought Dave's science-fiction novel, or whatever it was...
was stupid and sucked...
and was a waste of time.
it was embarrassing. Four years?
well, I thought that went pretty well.
Yeah.
it wasn't science fiction, just so you know.
what? - It wasn't science fiction.
what are you talking about? - Did you even read it?
no. One of the side characters was a scientist...
but that's not even important... - God damn it, Dave. God damn it!
what? I'm just asking, did you ever even read it?
it was hard to read. It was poorly written.
you're an asshole. God.
you are a champion asshole.
you're a real blue-ribbon fuck!
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.
I just want to know everything, so I can make it work. That's why I...
I want to try again. - I'm not going back. You fucked it up.
I mean, our marriage.
what?
I want to try again.
fuck you.
you know, Dave, you can't even...
you looked at it. That's dishonest. It's crappy.
Noreen. - Hey, should I look at yours?
that's all right.
no. No, no, Noreen...
throughout marriage BJs lacked enthusiasm.
had difference of opinion over how important that was.
I thought very.
you know what, Dave?
you want to know why my BJs lacked enthusiasm?
I hated you.
I hated your hair.
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?
and that's why I lacked enthusiasm when your cock was in my mouth.
Hey, hon.
Shelly, it's cold.
your father said it was going to be 65 degrees today, but...
go ahead. I'll see you later.
how did it go?
good.
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.
did you start my novel yet?
what's that?
breaking Point. Did you start that?
no, I haven't yet, Son. I've been preoccupied.
well, that's good, actually.
I want to make some changes, so...
I'll give you the new one.
what did he say?
it's further bad news.
the metastatic plane was too wide for radiation.
he suggested I see a Dr. Frost in New York for clinical trials.
I got a feeler from Hello America.
national.
they're looking at 20 guys, but they'll be cutting down to three soon.
it's a possibility.
the salary's great. It's real strong.
it would mean moving...
but I'd like to move everybody, you know?
renew things with Noreen.
we've been seeing somebody.
let the kids start over in New York.
keep them away from some of the bad influences here that...
just get a fresh start.
I think that would be great.
that would be terrific. - Yeah.
you could rededicate yourselves, knuckle down.
what's this?
it's a Big Gulp.
you should say, "We might see some snow but it might shift south, miss us.
I can say it, but I sort of wanna understand it.
why is it?
well, it's Canadian trade winds.
behind all of it?
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind out of Canada.
so what's it gonna do? - I don't know.
it's a guess.
it's wind, man. Blows all over the place.
for some reason...
I went back to Bolingbrook.
I bought a three-month lesson plan.
hang on. Before you do that, you know...
let's go out here and do a little stretching exercises.
you got to rotate your...
we warm up...
then do basic focus drills, stuff you never think about.
like closing an eye without moving your face...
because your face is the anchor point for your hand...
that allows you to focus.
you have to keep your triangle against a lot of force.
we do draws for a half hour, then releases.
that's called "loosing," when you release.
great shot! All right!
it's hard...
but that one good shot leaves you thinking...
you might be catching on.
do you lift weights?
what's that? - Do you lift weights?
Yeah.
cardio? - Yeah, you have to do both.
are you on any kind of a program?
Yeah, our gym coach gave us a program.
that should be good. - Yeah.
you know what would be interesting? - What?
we should take some pictures. Some shots, like...
some now, some in a month or whatever......
see if you're making gains.
Yeah.
I've got my mom's Nikon.
whip your shirt off. - Whip my shirt off?
Yeah.
you're shredded.
this is great, man.
we can compare this shit.
that's a Nikon FM?
well, yeah. You know something about cameras?
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.
a couple more.
my dad's gonna get the F3 for me...
if I can finish the program and maintain a B average.
it's like a $600 camera. I'm psyched about it.
I could loan that to you.
yeah?
I could loan that shit to you if you wanted it earlier.
okay.
this is gonna go a lot better.
Why?
because I got you some bobtail arrows. They're easier.
Why?
well, they're thicker at the ends.
see? They taper toward the nock.
what's the nock? - The arrow end.
what was I using before? - Chested arrows.
that guy didn't know what he was doing.
okay.
Fletch it.
what? - Fix your arrow in.
that's the term.
arrow makers were called fletchers. That's where the last name came from.
here. There's a little bit of a...
it takes a little while. Right there, right below the nock.
there!
awesome!
okay, let's loose a few.
let's show our stuff.
aim about a half-foot above.
okay. - You wait till you're steady.
are you aligned? - Yeah.
okay. Let it go.
fuck!
come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.
we probably didn't home long enough.
that's the pause between drawing back and firing.
let's pause a little longer.
what?
nothing.
are you just not interested? - Yeah.
Yeah, you're not interested? Or, yeah, you are interested?
Yeah, I'm not. Really.
what was it you liked? Let's think of it that way.
what?
what interested you when you thought about archery?
when you wanted to do it.
I don't know. Going hunting or something.
hunting?
Yeah.
for animals? - Yeah.
you wanna shoot animals with arrows?
Yeah. - You do?
Yeah, to kill them.
but that's not archery. That's hunting.
that's called bowhunting. That's what you wanted to do?
Bowhunting? - Yeah, I saw it on TV.
well, I don't really wanna kill animals with arrows...
so that's not going to happen. We can target shoot, Shelly.
it's not fun. - It's a lot of fun.
you have to apply yourself. - Targets don't move.
well, you know, Shelly...
you haven't really hit one yet.
you should support me.
I do support you. I support.
all right, forget it. Take your bracer off.
we're not shooting anymore. - Okay.
there's a chance I might be going to New York.
a small chance.
you think you'd like to come, maybe, if I go?
Yeah.
we could maybe go with Poppop.
he's got some tests. - Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, Mike.
you don't look real good, Dad.
are you okay? - Yeah.
what are you doing out here? - Just sitting here.
sometimes I just sit here and look at the house.
you park here sometimes? - Yeah. Sometimes.
I just like to see you guys. I see you playing guitar up there.
okay.
sounds good. - Thanks.
you know, Poppop... - Yeah.
...he's sick. - Mom said.
I was thinking about that, too.
why do you have a bow and arrow in there?
I was just out with Shelly. I'm not playing favorites.
I just think we need to be together for a while.
Yeah, that's okay.
how's your program going? - Great.
you're gonna get that camera if you keep it up!
look at this house.
someone should be happy here.
how did I fuck this up?
seriously.
what if I remembered the tartar sauce? Would things be different?
would Robert die not thinking I'm a jerk-off...
jerk-fuck?
don't forget the tartar sauce.
just call the order in, Noreen...
and quit busting my you-know-what, okay?
you always half-listen to what I'm saying to you!
I heard you. Tartar sauce.
tartar sauce. Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.
tartar sauce, tartar sauce, tartar sauce, tartar sauce.
man, how I'd like to put my face in there.
right in there. Tartar sauce.
my hips are cold. Tartar sauce.
that's when you know it's cold.
I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.
a lot of guys don't. Well, maybe they do.
maybe that's just black guys. Tartar sauce.
what happened to the guy who was trying to go around the world...
in a balloon? Did he make it?
I should put some espionage or stolen plutonium in my novel. Tartar sauce.
spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!
Neil Young? Why am I thinking about Neil Young?
Neil Diamond. Neil. There's not a lot of famous Neils.
is this Wednesday? I wish I had two dicks.
I thought the whole family was going to learn Spanish together this year.
that never really happened.
I haven't had a Spanish omelet in a long time.
here we go.
anything else?
no.
where is the tartar sauce?
they were out. They apologized.
they were cool about it. - They were out?
they were out. - They were out of tartar sauce?
I'm calling them.
fuck, Noreen.
it's not about the tartar sauce. It's about you. You don't care!
I don't care about tartar sauce!
I'm trying to make a living for this family.
I've got work things to think about and pressure.
tartar sauce? Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?
you are so selfish!
I would do anything for you...
everything you say is right. ...as if we're not happy.
I'm trying to take care of the family. - You come in here, looked in my face...
and you lied to me, Dave.
do you think I'm a moron? They're out.
we both just think it's better for the kids.
David, sacrifice is...
to get anything of value, you have to sacrifice.
I know that, Dad. But I think if we continue down this road...
it's going to be too detrimental for the kids.
it's just too hard.
do you know that the harder thing to do and the right thing to do are usually the same thing?
nothing that has meaning is easy.
easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.
I'm not comfortable with an 18-degree variance.
why even forecast? - It's a technical art...
not a science. People get that.
let's narrow it down, Tim. - Dave, it's random.
we do our best.
a day can have that variance.
Dave, phone call. - Tell him to take a message.
it's Hello America.
can we shop here?
sure. Where is that?
Bendel. - All right.
dad?
you know what? Let's go for a walk. Take a break.
you don't like it?
no, maybe we'll come back later. We'll just take a break.
so how's everything going? - Good.
how's school? - Good.
dance school? - Good.
you know, when I was in school...
I guess the hardest thing was how other kids can be a little mean Names and stuff.
do you ever get called names?
like what?
I don't know, like "dummy" if you miss a question...
or "camel toe."
Yeah. Camel toe.
do you know why?
why what?
why you get called camel toe?
Yeah.
why, hon?
because camel toes are tough.
they can walk all over the desert and all the hot rocks.
I'm tough.
that's right. It's because they're tough.
you ready to shop again?
I think they make car tires out of camel toes.
Yeah, I think I heard that.
I just think you're more grown-up than that other stuff.
I don't think I like it.
but that was sort of kid stuff.
I like this dress. It's New York style.
let me see.
Hey.
you like it? - I like it. Yeah.
do you like it?
Yeah, I think I do.
do you feel comfortable in it? Because, you know, that's the thing.
Yeah, it's comfy.
you look great.
you look all grown-up.
okay, change. Let's get some more.
Really?
sure, and then we'll go show Poppop some of this stuff.
Poppop! Poppop!
check this out. - That's nice, hon.
I know. I got a lot more, too!
Dave.
how are you feeling? - I'm all right.
Mike got arrested.
what?
he fucked his drug counselor's car up. They were on their way to a movie.
a movie?
Mike said he was trying to suck him off.
then Mike chucked a rock through his car's passenger window.
what is this sucking and chucking rocks?
I mean, what is this?
what did the guy say?
he said Mike tried to jack his wallet.
what is this sucking and chucking and jacking and fucking-up, Son?
he's 15 years old!
what is this shit?
where is he? - He's at home.
what is this?
fuck.
are you ready for the doctors?
Yeah.
got you! You're dead.
I think just what he said happened, happened.
I think the guy was trying to make a move on him...
and Mike got surprised and scared.
hon, will you get me a pop from the pop machine?
can you get your pop later?
I'm trying to send Shelly away so she doesn't have to hear this.
this guy says that Mike tried to steal his wallet...
and that's why they were fighting when the police came.
how is he? - He's scared. I don't know.
I can come home.
no, stay there and do your Hello America thing.
you act like... - What?
like Mike's in trouble...
because I'm interviewing at Hello America. Give me a break!
I don't have any money.
Russ is helping anyway.
that dildo's what? - He's been a big help, okay?
you can stay there.
fine. I'll stay here with camel toe.
you just take care of stuff there! You take care of it!
camel toe? What are you talking about?
I had to find out how kids taunt Shelly about that...
and you're letting her get taunted.
you're not paying attention to the way she goes to school!
I take care of everything around here.
well, I bought her new stuff.
I bought her a bunch of brand new stuff...
and she told me all kinds of stuff, so... - Don't be such a dick.
you have her for one weekend.
you know what, Noreen? Just...
fuck! Whatever. Let me talk to Mike.
he's sleeping, and don't talk to me like that.
more "dildo," more "fucking..."
listen, I have to go, Noreen. I'll talk to you soon.
whatever.
I thought you were trying to improve matters with Noreen if not reconcile.
I am. What did Frost say?
he wants to speak to me in about 10 minutes.
it was cold in there.
would you get me a coffee, Dave? So I can warm up.
Yeah, Dad.
Hi.
Hi. $0. 65.
fuck.
Poppop went in?
Yeah. - Great. Yeah. He wanted a coffee.
do you have my wallet?
you only had $1.
you should carry more money than that.
I know.
well, did he say whether any more therapy could...
no, he didn't have a different opinion than Pritch.
there's too large a plane.
it's a no-go.
well, did he say... - He said months.
did he say a lot of months? - Well, what's a lot?
I don't know, like 12.
well, if he meant 12, he probably would've said a year, Son.
I think he meant three or four.
well, you have a big day tomorrow.
the Hello America show.
Yeah.
...and here comes the grand marshal, Dave Spritzel.
didn't his name used to be Spritz?
Yeah, it sure did...
but he changed it back to the original Spritzel.
why the change, Ed?
well, when you're national, there's no more up.
so he changed it back...
like John "Cougar" Mellencamp. He's realer now and more authentic.
who's that with him? - Those are the wife and kids.
didn't they used to have a real fucked-up relationship?
not anymore. That's something else that changed.
it seems Hello America with Byrant Gumbel...
gave them all a fresh start...
and an increase in salary to $980, 000 outside promotional fees...
which puts Dave well over $1 million a year.
that got his wife's ear, I bet. - You bet. That buys a lot of face time.
now everything's great.
Hello, America.
what are your hobbies?
writing. Archery.
and you don't have a degree in meteorology?
general communications.
well, listen. We've seen a lot of your work in Chicago.
okay.
we think you're great, refreshing.
we love the Spritz Nipper.
great.
why don't we run some blue screen, and we'll do a walk-through on the set?
great.
here's your station. We'll run some screen.
give me a second to set it up.
I'm waiting for Mark. I'm running some screen.
Dave. - Bryant.
nervous? - No.
sure? - Yeah.
you look just a little bit nervous.
it's not nerves.
other shit. - Yeah.
...mild in the Northwest.
as this high-pressure system gives way...
we'll see warm temperatures in New Mexico...
I know it's not neurosurgery...
but green screen is the one part of my job that's not really easy.
...35 in New York with colder temperatures west to Michigan...
you need a sense of where put-ons will come from...
and a pretty strong sense of scale.
I've gotten real good at it.
I thought everything went over pretty well.
so we'll let you know in a couple of days.
okay.
this is my father, Robert Spritzel, and my daughter.
we're a little late for our plane...
so we thought we'd leave from here.
Yeah, I'm sorry. We kept you late. - That's cool.
so you've got the numbers? - Yes.
there's a built-in with Purina I forgot. $42, 000.
okay.
what's a built-in? - It's a compulsory endorsement...
if I'm offered the job.
dog food? - Yeah. Pet products.
Dave doesn't own a pet.
well, I have Jackson.
jackson lives with your wife and kids.
we'll let you know.
Russ is here. - Okay.
Where's Mike? - Inside.
Dave. - Hi, Russ.
he's upstairs. He's still pretty upset about it.
did he talk about it? - Yeah.
to you? - He's told us what happened.
he was with his counselor, Don Boden. I guess he...
I don't really know why what happened next happened.
he was talking about my son, and I was taking my gloves off.
apparently, they were going to a movie...
what the fuck? - Why are you here?
what are you doing? - Why are you here?
I'm helping Noreen! - Why are you helping?
Dave. - Son. Jesus.
here's something that...
if you want your father to think you're not a silly fuck...
don't slap a guy across the face with a glove.
because if you do that, that's what he will think...
unless you're a nobleman or something in the 19th century...
which I'm not.
you can get inside okay, Dad? - Yeah.
when my back's against the wall, I order a chink call-girl...
or I box some rounds with Richie...
the Puerto Rican southpaw at Clancey's gym.
but tonight, Roy thought...
once I smuggle this fucking plutonium out...
I'm just going to drink some Scotch and hit the sack.'
Roy had picked up Oliver at his science lab...
and there he snagged the vials.
he stashed them in his computer case...
my mom discovered an idea known as a living funeral in a book she read to help her with Robert dying.
it's where someone's family and friends gather...
like they might at the person's funeral...
only when the person's alive, so they can see everybody.
Hey, what's up? - What's up?
Hey, what's the Nipper?
what's that? - What's the Nipper this week?
I don't know.
you don't know yet?
come on, man.
what? I just asked you about the Nipper.
monday, okay? That's the... Okay?
what's your problem? - It's February, man. It's cold.
fuck!
fuck you, then. - Fuck you!
do you know what variance is?
you think you could pick out a day a week ahead and give a realistic... You know?
did you know that? - Weatherman!
God! Fuck!
I have kids!
I have to go see my kids!
you put fucking pie shit on my coat!
I have to see my kids with pie on me, man?
go see your kids with shit on you!
Hey, calm down, man!
I have to see my family!
I have to see...
Hello? - Hello? Dave?
what? - It's Mark Dersen from Hello America.
Hi, Dave.
take care. - Okay.
Noreen.
Shelly looks nice.
we bought that in New York.
Yeah, I know. That's why I said it.
it's very nice.
Noreen, I got offered the show. Hello America with Bryant Gumbel.
well, that's great.
are you gonna take it? - I'm thinking about it.
it's a pretty substantial salary, and you know the venue. It's big.
it's a pretty big salary jump, I guess.
$1. 2 million all in, Noreen.
can we think about that?
what?
what that kind of change could be like for everybody.
Mike, Shelly, you know?
if we thought about trying again.
Dave, I'm marrying Russ.
accuracy equals focusing on a point.
gravity pulls an inch a yard.
you point up.
but you have to factor in wind...
but you have to factor in wind...
which is the most difficult part.
Noreen.
I had to go in anyway.
it was time for my speech.
and that's what I know about Robert Spritzel.
forbearance, charity, wisdom.
there are too few like him.
and now Robert's son, David.
good afternoon.
many of you came from long distances...
and I know I speak for my mom and Noreen...
and my family, Mike and Shelly, when I say thank you.
when I think of my dad, I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock.
and then the power went out.
then, when the lights came back on in 40 minutes...
everyone had pretty much forgotten that I was talking...
and we never finished that part of the thing.
so my speech was, "When I think of my dad...
I think of Bob Seger's Like a Rock."
that's all I said at my dad's living funeral...
something about Bob Seger.
you've reached 272-7638. Please leave a message.
Dave, it's Mark Dersen from Hello America.
can you give me a call back? I called a couple of times Friday...
and I'm wondering why you haven't called me back.
if I need to move down on my list, look, I need to know. Okay?
it's not "Hello," you know, whatever, Orlando.
look. I'm still jacked about you, Dave.
I just need to hear from you. Give me a call.
your phone's ringing.
I know.
why aren't you getting it?
it's the Bryant Gumbel thing.
so why aren't you getting it?
did you bring that stuff?
it's by the door.
you should get it.
fuck.
it was a McDonald's hot apple pie.
they're not kidding.
it was hot.
the other thing that gets to people that leads to pies, I guess...
are these catch phrases we're required to use...
to single the program out.
it gets under people's skin.
spritz Nipper.
but the whole thing about all of it...
all the getting hit with stuff...
the whole thing is, who gets hit with a fucking pie, anyway?
did anyone ever throw a pie at Thomas Jefferson?
or Buzz Aldrin? I doubt it.
but this is like the ninth time I got...
clowns get hit with pies.
fuck! - I'm Mike's father! Here's your shit!
I saw you buy this at the mall on North Avenue!
and I'm telling the cops, too!
so you can cut your crap about Mike jacking your wallet!
he's just a kid. See!
he looks grown, but he's just a kid!
you fucking asshole.
I mean, I'll bet no one ever threw a pie at, like...
harriet Tubman, the founder of the Underground Railroad.
I'll bet you a million fucking dollars.
the first time I was struck with something...
a chicken breast from Kenny Rogers...
I was standing next to a garbage pail.
I thought it might've been an accident, that they were throwing it out.
the second time, it hit me square on the chin a soft taco.
then, pop.
a falafel.
McNuggets.
always fast food.
fast food.
shit people would rather throw out than finish.
it's easy. It tastes all right...
but it doesn't really provide you any nourishment.
I'm fast food.
did you see him? - Yeah.
am I gonna get in trouble? I didn't do anything.
you're not in trouble. I took care of it.
I got on him.
I let him know we're not messing around.
I whaled on him.
what?
I caught him one clean one for sure, on the forehead...
and then I fucking whaled on him.
Seriously?
he's not going to say you stole anything, and you're not in trouble.
what are you eating? - Corn dog.
you're a kid, Mike. Fuck.
I'm not a kid. - You are a kid.
don't put yourself in grown-up situations again until you're a grown-up.
okay. - Okay?
do you want me to get you a corn dog? - What? No.
what do you want?
nothing.
Weatherman!
are you all right? - Yeah.
I just wanted you to...
what?
I was eighteen
I don't really get it.
am I following it?
it was just a lead up to other things I wanted to say.
here's the part.
and I held firm
to what I felt was right
like a rock
I wanted to talk about that part...
that's like you.
I was strong as I could be Like a rock
I got the job.
new York?
that's terrific. That's a remarkable income.
that's more money than I ever made, that salary.
Yeah.
that's quite an American accomplishment.
Thanks.
are you okay?
I can't knuckle down.
Noreen's marrying Russ.
there's nothing to knuckle down on, so...
I can't fucking knuckle down.
your hand.
I just saw Mike's counselor.
Mike mentioned that you were gonna fix this business up.
he's in no trouble?
good job.
your hand okay?
it's okay.
you certain? - Don't worry.
you always worry about your kids...
no matter how old.
there's always looking after.
I read your book.
fuck.
I was going to do some more work on it, then I chucked it.
you chucked it. - Garbage.
it's just what I do, David.
I've practiced and I've gotten good.
like you and the weather business.
but I don't predict it.
nobody does, 'cause it's just wind. It's wind.
it blows all over the place!
what the fuck?
I have to go to work.
David.
this shit life...
we must chuck some things.
we must chuck them...
in this shit life.
there's always looking after.
you have time.
Thanks.
pretty soon after Robert's living funeral, we had his real one.
I'm sorry for your loss.
that's a lovely thing to say to me.
Where'd you hear that?
his friends.
I'm glad one of you brought an umbrella.
I had a feeling it was going to rain today.
you're not going to take my job, are you?
no. I'm going to be a cameraman for Monday Night Football.
is that okay?
Yeah. That's good.
there are a great many of Robert's friends here, even in winter.
I think it's because Robert was unusual.
I think that's what brought so many of you out.
a loving husband and father for 40 years.
and a good friend to some of you for longer.
I'm sure that's why we appreciated and loved Robert.
he was excellent.
selfless.
resolute.
I remember once...
imagining what my life would be like, what I'd be like.
I pictured having all these qualities.
strong, positive qualities...
that people could pick up on from across a room.
but as time passed...
few ever became any qualities I actually had.
and all the possibilities I faced, and the sorts of people I could be...
all of them got reduced every year to fewer and fewer...
until finally they got reduced to one...
to who I am.
and that's who I am...
the weatherman.
but first Dave Spritz has the check of our national weather. Dave.
well, thanks, Bryant. Well, it feels like spring if you're in the Northeast.
is it gonna last? Let's take a look.
we've got a warm weather system to thank for these high temperatures...
Mike, you ready for school?
Russ?
let's go, guys.
come on.
you're gonna get it!
Bye, Shelly. - Bye, Mom.
that's your national weather. I'll be back with your local focus...
Hey, are you Dave Spritz? - Yeah.
can I get your autograph? - Sure.
so is it going to rain today?
who knows?
Hey, Hello America.
I've been doing the show for a few months.
people don't throw things at me anymore...
maybe because I carry a bow around.
I don't know.
I go back to Chicago weekends...
keep it steady with Mike and Shelly...
come back, do the weather. So... Forecast?
come on.
another man is with my family.
things didn't work out the way I predicted.
accepting that's not easy...
but easy doesn't enter into grown-up life.
I'll take this American accomplishment.
that's where I live...
behind Fire Brigade 47. Okay.
but in front of SpongeBob.
Hello, America.
movie Fan News presents:
spotlight on "Adventure" .
what you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America, lurking in the shadow of Majestic Paradise Falls， it's full of plants and animals undiscovered by science.
who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit?
why, our subject today, Charles Muntz.
the beloved explorer lands his dirigible, "The Spirit of Adventure," into New Hampshire, completing a year long expedition to the lost world.
this mighty aircraft was designed by Charles Muntz himself and is longer than 22 throw edition petty wagons placed end to end.
and here comes the adventurer now.
never- apart from his faithful dogs,
Muntz conceived the craft for the canine comfort.
it's a veritable flouting palace in the sky complete with doggy baths and mechanical canine walker.
and Jiminy Cricket! To the locals he's considered a business! And how!
adventure is out there!
but what has Muntz brought back this time?
gentlemen, I give you the Monster of Paradise Falls!
and gully, what a swell monster this is!
but what's this? Scientists cry "Foul! "
the National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton.
No!
the organization strips Muntz of his membership.
humiliated, Muntz vows to return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast alive.
I promise to capture the beast alive!
and I will not come back until I do!
and so, the explorer's off to clear his name.
bon voyage, Charles Muntz!
and good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls!

don't you know this is an exclusive club?
only explorers get in here, not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles!
you think you got what it takes? Do you? - I...
all right, you're in! Welcome aboard!
what's wrong? Can't you talk?
Hey, I don't bite.

I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it!
my name is Ellie.
there it is!
well... go ahead.

Hey, kid!
I thought you might need a little cheering up.
I got something to show you!
I am about to let you see something.
I have never shown to another human being.

Charles Muntz, explorer.
when I get big, I'm going where he's going.
south America.
it's like America, but South.
wander where I'm gonna live?
paradise Falls.
a land lost in time.
I ripped this right out of a library book!
I'm gonna move my club house there!
and park up right next to the falls.
who knows what lives up there!
and once I get there...
well, I'm gonna save all these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have.
only... I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.
that's it! You can take us there in a blimp!
swear you'll take us there! Cross your heart!
cross it! Cross your heart!
good, you promised. No backing out!
well, see you tomorrow, kid. Bye!
adventure is out there!
you know, you don't talk very much.
I like you.
quite a sight, hey, Ellie?
he... mail is here.
shady OAKS, Retirement Village, oh, brother!
Hey, good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
need any help there?
no... Yes... Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house.
well, just to let you know, my boss will be happy to take this whole place off your hand...
...and would double his last offer.
what do you say to that?
I'll take that as a no, then.
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear.
you poured prune juice in his gas tank.
Yeah, that was good!
here, let me talk to him.
you, in the suit. Yes, you!
take a bath, hippie!
I am not with him!
this is serious! He's out to get your house!
tell your boss he can have our house.
Really?
when I'm dead!
I'll take that as a "maybe."

good afternoon.
my name is Russell and I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54, squad lodge 12.
are you in need of any assistance today, Sir?
no.
I could... help you cross the street.
no.
I could help you cross your... yard?
no.
I could help you cross your... tribe.
no.
well, I gotta help you cross something.
no, I'm doing fine.
good afternoon.
my name is Russell. - Kid...
and I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54.
slow down...
... squad lodge 12. - Kid!
are you in need of any assistance? - Thank you, but I don't need any help!
proceed.
good afternoon.
skip to the end!
see these? These are my wilderness explorer badges.
you may notice one is missing.
it's my "Assisting the elderly badge."
if I get it, I'll become a senior wilderness explorer!
the wilderness must be explored!
it's gonna be great!
there is a big ceremony and all the dads come and...
they pin on our badges...
so you wanna assist an old person. - Yeah!
then I'll be a senior wilderness explorer!
have you ever heard of a "snipe"? - "Snipe"?
a bird. Big eyes.
every night it sneaks into my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas.
I'm elderly and infirm.
I can't catch it.
if only someone could help me... - Me, me, I'll do it!
I don't know, it's awfully crafty.
you'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in.
I'll find her, Mr. Fredricksen!
I think its burrow is two blocks down...
two blocks down. Got it!
snipe! Here, snipie, snipie...
bring it back here when you find it!
OK，keep it coming...
...and stop... Stop... Stop!
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?
I am so sorry, Sir.
don't touch that!
no, no, no, let me take care of that for you.
get away from our mailbox!
sir... - I don't want you to touch that!
are you alright? - It looks bad.
<b> court SUMMONS</b>
sorry, Mr. Fredricksen.
you don't seem like a public menace to me.
take this.
the guys from "Shady Oaks" will be by to pick you up in the morning, ok?
what do I do now, Ellie?
good morning, gentlemen.
good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.
you're ready to go?
ready as I'll ever be.
would you do me the favour and take this?
I'll meet you in the van in just a minute.
I... wanna say one last goodbye to the old place.
sure. Take all the time you need, Sir.
that's typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time.
you'd think he'd take better care of his house.
so long, boys!
I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!
<b> south AMERICA</b>
we are on our way, Ellie.
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.
it's me, Russell.
what are you doing out here, kid?
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch.
but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse.
please, let me in.
no.
Aw, all right. You can come in.
I've never been in a floating house before.
Goggles... Look at this stuff!
are you going on a trip?
"paradise Falls, a land lost in time."
are you going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen?
don't touch that! You'll soil it.
you know, most people take a plane.
but you're smart, because you have your TV, clocks and stuff.
ooo, is this how you steer your house?
does it really work?
this makes it turn right and that way is left.
Hey, look! Buildings!
that building's so close, I can almost touch it!
wow, this is great!
you should try this, Mr. Fredricksen.
look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here!
don't jerk around so much, kid!
well, that's not gonna work.
I know that cloud, it's a "cumulonimbus."
did you know that a cumulonimbus...
aaa, I stayed up all night blowing upballoons... for what? - that's how you get lightning
that's nice, kid.
what are you doing over there?
look!
see? Cumulonimbus.
my bag!
got you!
Uuu, I thought you were dead.
what happened?
I steered us. I did it! I steered the house.
you steered us?
after you tied your stuff down, you took a nap.
so I went ahead and steered us down here.
Yeah, sure.
I can't tell where we are.
o, we're in South America all right.
it was a singe. I used my wilderness explorer GPS.
GP... what?
my dad gave it to me.
it shows exactly where we are on the planet.
with this baby we'll never be lost!
we'll get you down, find a bus stop, and you'll just tell the man you want to get back to your mother.
sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls.
there, that ought to do it.
there, I'll give you some change for the bus fare.
no, I'll just use my city bus pass.
it's just gonna be like a billion passes to get back to my house.
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?
well, we're up pretty high.
it'll take hours to get down.
I think that was a building or something.
what was that, Mr. Fredricksen?
we can't be close to the ground yet.
wait, no, no!
wait, wait!
hang on!
pull back!
where... where are we?
this doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
don't worry, Ellie. I've got it.
there it is!
Ellie, it's so beautiful!
we made it!
we made it! Russell, we can float right over there.
climb up, climb up!
do you mean... assist you?
Yeah, whatever. - Ok, I'll climb up!
watch it! - Sorry.
now... when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up.
got it?
are you on the porch yet?
what? That's it?
I came all this way here to get stuck on the wrong end of this rock pile?
Ah... great.
Hey, if I could assist you over there...
would you sign up for my badge?
what are you talking about?
we could walk your house to the fall.
walk it? - Yeah.
after all we weigh it down, we could walk it right over there.
like a parade balloon.
now, we'll walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash dancing.
we have three days at best till the helium leaks out of those balloons.
and if we are not at the falls when that happens...
we're not getting to the falls.
I found sand!
don't you worry, Ellie.
we'll get our house over there.
it is fun already, isn't it?
by the time we get there,
you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the wilderness explorer call.
wait, why are we going to Paradise Falls, again?
Hey, let's play a game.
it's called: "See who can be quiet the longest."
cool! My mom loves that game!
darn thing...
come on, Russell, hurry it up.
Ah, I'm tired.
my knee hurts.
which knee?
my elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom.
I asked you about that five minutes ago.
I didn't have to go then!
I don't wanna walk anymore...
please, stop...
Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you.
there are no tigers in South America.
zoology.
Ah, for the love of Pete... Go on into the bushes and do your business.
OK. Here! Hold my stuff!
I've always wanted to try this.
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose to dig the hole before or after?
that's none of my concern.
Oh, it's "before"!
tracks?
snipe.
here, snipe.
come on out, snipe.
snipe!
got you. Don't be afraid, little snipe.
I am a wilderness explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature.
want some more?
Hi, boy. Don't eat it all.
come on out.
come on. Come on...
don't be afraid, little snipe.
nice snipe. Good little snipe.
nice... giant snipe!
I found the snipe.
Oh, did you?
are they tall? - Oh, yes. They're very tall.
do they have a lot of colors?
they do, indeed.
do they like chocolate? - Oh, yeah...
chocolate?
what is that thing?
it's a snipe.
there no such thing as a snipe!
but you said...
go on, get out of here! Go!
careful, Russell.
look, Mr. Fredricksen, he likes me.
Russell! - No, stop! That tickles!
get out of here! Go on! Get!
no, no, no. Kevin, it's ok.
Mr. Fredricksen is nice.
Kevin? - Yes, that's the name I just gave him.
bit it, boo, scram!
Hey, that's mine!
Aah... Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!
go on, bit it!
can we keep him? Please?
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers...
no.
an explorer is a friend to all, be it a plant, a fish or a tiny mole.
that doesn't even rhyme.
Yeah, it does.
Hey, look, Kevin. - What?
Hey, get down from there! You're not allowed up there!
you come down here right now!
can you believe this, Ellie?
Ellie?
Hey, Ellie, can I keep the bird?
Aha... aha
she said for you to let me.
but I told him no. I told you no.
n - O!
I see you, back there.
go on, get out of here! Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while.
Hey, are you ok over there?
Hello?
Oh, hello, Sir. Thank Goodness.
it's nice to know someone else is up here.
I can smell you.
what?
you can... smell us?
I can smell you.
you were talking to a rock.
Hey, that one looks like a turtle.
look at that one! That one looks like a dog!
Ah, it is a dog. - What?
we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment.
Hey, I like dogs!
we have your dog!
I wonder whom he belongs to. - Sit, boy.
Hey, look, he's trained!
shake.
Aha. Speak.
Hi, there.
did that dog just say "Hi, there"?
Oh, yes!
my name is Dug. I just met you and I love you.
my master made me this collar.
he is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk, Squirrel!
my master is good and smart.
it's not possible.
Oh yes... It is because my master is smart.
Hey, cool! What do these do, boy?
would you cut... I'd use that collar... I would be happy if you stopped.
Russell, don't touch that.
it could be... radioactive or something.
I am a great tracker. My master sent me on a special mission.
all by myself. Have you seen a bird?
I want to find one and I've been on a scent.
I'm a great tracker. Did I mention that?
Hey, that is a bird. I have never seen one up close. But this is the bird.
may I take your bird up to camp as my prisoner?
Yes, yes, take it. And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog.
I can bark... And here's howling.
can we keep him, please? Please, please, please?
no. - But it's a talking dog!
it's just a weird trick or something.
let's get to the fall.
please, be my prisoner! Oh, please! oh, please! be my prisoner!
Oh, here it is! I picked up the bird's scent!
wait a minute, wait a minute. What is this?
chocolate. I smell chocolate.
I'm getting prunes and ginger cream.
who are they?
Oh, man, the master will not be pleased.
we'd better tell him someone took the bird, right, Alfa?
no. Soon enough the bird will be ours again.
find the scent, my compadres, and you too, shall have much rewarding from the master for the toil that you did.
Hey, Alfa, I think there's something wrong with your collar.
you must have broken it.
Yeah. Your voice sounds funny.
beta, Delta!
perhaps you desire... Squirrel!
perhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.
no, no. No.
but maybe Dug would. You might wanna ask him.
I wonder if he's found the bird on his "very special mission."
do not mention Dug to me at this time.
his fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied, indeed.
do you not agree with that which I'm saying to you now?
sure. But the second the master finds out that you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.
you're unwise, my trusted lieutenant.
this is Alfa. Calling Dug. Come in, Dug.
Hi, Alfa. Your voice sounds funny.
I know, I know!
have you seen the bird?
Oh, yes. The bird is my prisoner now.
Yeah, right.
impossible. Where are you?
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back, and then you like me. Oh, gotta go.
dug, who are you talking to?
wait, wait! - What is Dug doing?
why is he with the small mailman?
where are they?
there he is. Come on!
please, oh, please, be my prisoner.
dug, stop bothering Kevin!
that man over there says I can take the bird.
and I love that man there like he is my master.
I am not your master!
I am warning you once again, bird!
Hey, quit it! - I am jumping on you now, bird!
at this rate we will never get to the falls!
I am nobody's master, got it?
I don't want you here and I don't want you here!
I'm stuck with you!
if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three...
a ball! Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball!
ball? You want a ball?
Yes, I do! I ever so want the ball!
go get it!
Oh, boy, I will get it and then bring it back!
quick, Russell, give me some chocolate.
Why? - Just give to me!
bird! Bird!
come on, Russell.
wait! Wait, Mr. Fredricksen!
what are you doing?
Hey, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.
I think that did the trick.
Hi, master.
afternoon.
well, thanks for keeping us dry, anyway, Ellie.
which one is the front?
well, boy...
is this step three or step five?
there.
all done. That's for you.
well, tents are hard.
wait, aren't you super wilderness guy with the GPS and the badges?
Yeah, but...
can I tell you a secret?
no. - All right. Here it goes.
I never actually built a tent before. There! I said it.
you've been camping before, haven't you?
well, never outside...
well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.
try him sometime, maybe he'll surprise you.
he's away a lot, I don't see him much.
he's gotta be home sometime.
I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much.
Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name?
Phyllis isn't my mom. - Oh!
but he promised he'd come to my Explorers Ceremony to pin on my "Assisting the elderly badge."
so he can show me how about the tent then, right?
Hey, why don't you get some sleep?
we don't want to wake the travelling flea circus.
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner.
we have to protect him.
can Kevin go with us?
all right, he can come.
promise you won't leave him?
Yeah.
cross your heart?
cross my heart.
what have I got myself into, Ellie?
good morning, sweetheart.
we'd better get moving.
the bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice.
all right, everybody up!
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
dug, find Kevin! - Find the bird, find the bird!
point!
Oh, look! There he is...
point!
Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof!
Yeah, get off of his roof!
what is he doing?
the bird is calling to her babies.
her babies!
Kevin is a... girl?
her house is over there, in those twisty rocks.
she's been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them.
wait, Kevin is just leaving.
but you promised to protect her.
her babies need her. We gotta make sure they're together.
sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already.
yeah...
it was her favorite chocolate.
because you sent her away, there's more for you.
Kevin?
Where's the bird? You said you had the bird!
Oh, yes, oh, yes. If I had said that,
I can see how you would think that.
where is it?
Oh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes.
you lost it. why do I not have a surprised feeling?
well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and to the one that smells as prunes.
the master will be most pleased we have found them.
he will ask them many questions. Come.
wait! We're not going with you.
we're going to the fall.
get away from me!
stay!
you came here... in that?
Yeah.
in a house? A floating house?
that is the darnest thing I've ever seen!
you're not after my bird, are you?
but if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige!
well, this is all a misunderstanding.
my dogs made a mistake.
wait. Are you Charles Muntz?
well... yes.
the Charles Muntz?
adventure's out there!
it's really him!
that's Charles Muntz!
it is?
who's Charles Muntz?
him!
Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans.
Oh, well, you're a man of good taste.
now you must be tired. Hungry?
attention, everyone! These people are no longer intruders.
they are our guests.
all right! I like you temporarily.
I will not bite you.
the small mailman smells like chocolate!
I'm sorry about the dogs,
I hope they weren't too rough on you.
go ahead and pull your airship right next to mine.
we are not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?
Oh, would you like to?
would I?
wait up, Mr. Muntz!
Jiminy Cricket!
not you! - What do we do with Dug?
he lost the bird. Put him in "the cone of shame."
I do not like "the cone of shame."
most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums:
new York, Munich, London.
of course, I kept the best for myself.
did you ever... Look at that!
Oh, yes. The Arsinoitherium.
the beast charged while I was brushing my teeth.
I used my shaving kit to bring it down.
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me.
the only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared dental equipment.
Oh, my Gosh! The giant Somalian Labradoodles!
Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed!
there's an interesting story there.
excellent choice.
I found it on safari, with Roosevelt
he and I fell into a habit of playing Gin Rummy in the evenings and did he cheat!
he was horrible.
master, dinner is ready.
Oh, dear, broken translator.
I think it's that loose wire again.
there you go, big fellow. - Thank you, master.
I liked his other voice.
well, dinner is served.
right this way.
so, how are things States side?
almost tempted to go back a few times.
but I have unfinished work here.
please! I hope you're hungry.
because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had.
epsilon, you've done it again!
my Ellie would have loved all these.
you know, because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by the fall.
I'm honored. And now you've made it.
you sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose.
no, no, it's a pleasure to have guests.
a real treat.
treat?
Where's my treat? I want my treat!
Hey!
I shouldn't have used that word.
having guests is a delight!
more often I get thieves trying to steal what is rightfully mine.
no...
they called me a fraud, those...
but once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared.
beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, I've spent a lifetime tracking it.
sometimes, years go by between sailings.
I've tried to smoke it out of that death land where it lives.
can't go in after it.
once in, there's no way out.
I lost so many dogs.
here they come those bandits and think the bird is theirs to take!
they'll soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place.
Hey, that looks like Kevin!
Kevin? - Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird!
I trained it to follow us.
follow you?
impossible. How?
she likes chocolate.
chocolate?
Yeah. I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes gaga for it.
but it ran off.
let's go now.
you know, Carl...
these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories
a surveyor making a map...
a botanist cataloguing plants...
an old man taking his house to Paradise Falls.
that's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends.
well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.
you're not leaving.
we don't want to take advantage of your hospitality.
come on, Russell.
but we haven't even had dessert yet.
Oh, the boy is right.
you haven't had dessert.
epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee.
you really must stay! I insist!
we have so much more to talk about!
Kevin?
it's here.
get them!
Hurry! - Kevin!
dogs! They are coming!
master! Over here!
go toward the mine, master!
left!
Russell!
get back!
go on, master! I will stop the dogs!
stop, you, dogs!
help!
give me your hand!
hang on to Kevin!
Kevin!
no, no, no. Kevin...
stay down.
she's hurt real bad.
can't we help her get home?
all right. But we gotta hurry.
you lost them? - No, it was Dug.
Yeah, he's with them. he helped them escape!
wait. Wait a minute.
dug.
see anything? - No, my pack is not following us.
boy, they are dumb!
this is crazy.
I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us.
what a joke. - Hey, I know a joke!
a squirrel walks up up to a tree and says:
I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead."
it is funny because the squirrel gets dead.
careful, Russell.
you ok, Kevin?
you know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
the wilderness isn't quite what I expected.
yeah? How so?
it's kind of... wild.
I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book.
get used to that, kid.
my dad made it sound so easy.
he is really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff...
he used to come to all my squad lodge meetings.
and afterwards, we go get ice-cream at fentons.
I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle.
then we sit on this one curb, right outside and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones and whoever gets the most wins.
I like that curb.
it might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most.
look, there it is!
hold on, Russell, stand still.
look at that bird go! Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
that's it! Go, Kevin! Go find your babies!
run, Kevin, run!
Oh, no!
Russell, give me a knife!
get away from my bird!
No!
No!
careful, I want it in good shape for my return.
let her go!
stop!
Kevin!
you gave away Kevin.
you just... gave her away.
this is none of my concern.
I didn't ask for any of these!
master, it's all right.
I am not your master!
if you hadn't shown up, none of these would have happened.
bad dog, bad dog!
whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls, if it kills me!
here
I don't want this anymore.
thanks for the adventure .- now go have a new one! love ! Ellie
Russell?
Russell! - I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't!
no, Russell, no!
Russell?
I was hiding under your porch because I love you.
can I stay?
can you stay? Well, you're my dog, aren't you?
and I'm your master.
you're my master?
Oh, boy! - Good boy, Dug!
you're a good boy!
Yes!
don't worry, Kevin, I'll save you.
and they wouldn't believe me.
just wait till they get a look at you!
master.
the small mailman has returned.
what?
let me go!
where is your elderly friend?
he's not my friend anymore.
if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind.
where are you keeping Kevin?
let me go!
scream all you want, small mailman.
none of your mailmen friends can hear you.
I will unleash all my wilderness explorer training!
Alfa, Fredricksen is coming back!
guard that bird.
if you see the old man, you know what to do.
where are you going? I'm not finished with you!
nice talking with you.
where are you, Fredricksen?
help!
Russell!
Mr. Fredricksen! - Dug, bring her over!
you came back for Kevin! Let's go get her!
I'm getting Kevin. You stay here.
but I wanna help! - I don't want your help.
I want you safe.
how do we get pass these dogs?
point!
Kevin!
don't worry, Kevin. We are on our way.
no one should be entering through these doors.
guard well that bird, my minions.
what do we do now, Dug?
who wants the ball?
me, me, me!
go get it!
I got it!
I'm sorry, Kevin. Let's get you out of here.
master, he's gone. - What's going on?
he's got the bird! - He ran off!
calm down! One at the time!
I want to... help!
does anybody know where they are?
raid leaders! Bring down that house!
raid leader! Checking in!
raid 2, checking in. - Raid 3, checking in.
target sighted.
come on, Kevin.
Hi.
any last words, Fredricksen?
come on, spit it out!
enough!
you are not taking that bird and leaving me alive!
you're dead!
come on, Kevin.
I'll have plenty of enjoyment for what I'm about to do to you.
he wears the cone of shame!
not just continue sitting! Attack!
No! No! Stop your laughing!
listen, you, dog, sit!
Yes, Alfa.
Alfa? I am not Alfa, he is... Oh!
I can't do it.
Russell...

Hey! Squirrel! - Squirrel? Where?
I hate squirrels!
dug! - Master!
Russell, over here!
let's go!
Mr. Fredricksen!
come on, Kevin.
No!
Russell, get out of there!
leave them alone!
Russell, hang on to Kevin! Don't let go! Grab on to him!
Kevin! Chocolate!
that was cool!
don't jerk around so much, kid.
easy, Russell.
Oh, I am ready to not be up high.
sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen.
you know... It's just a house.
look at you! You're so soft!
I wish I could keep one.

Oh, no!
