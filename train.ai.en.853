what are you even doing here?
come on. Let's go say hi to mom.
daddy V-D-Dubs has known the Rhodes sisters since high school.
I bet he has a secret or two he'd be willing to share if you ask nicely.
Hey, Serena said you left, but here you are with Ivy.
Hi, Nate. - I don't know why you're here, but we should probably leave since Lola and I were just walking out.
no, I'm gonna stay, and so is she.
we're gonna get to the bottom of why my mom really kept me away all these years, so, um, if you don't mind...
Oui. Oui.
naturellement.
well? - He agreed.
I need to be on the next plane back.
I'm to be amongst the royal court tomorrow when the prince breaks the news in a press conference about how it became clear you were only ever after his title.
but, uh - Okay. Okay. What else?
then the royal family's publicist will start to build me up, the woman who has watched from the wings for decades.
okay, enough about you. More about me.
her Serene Highness and the prince are only willing to annul the marriage if you agree to a gag order on all matters regarding the dissolution.
they can be the only ones to speak about it publicly.
do you understand what that means?
well, I'll do whatever they say, as long as it gets me out of this marriage.
a press blackout is a small price to pay to get my life back.
that includes no more blind items on "Page Six" or posts on "Gossip Girl.
princess sophie was very clear if you don't adhere to the deal, they'll make you pay.
do whatever you want in your private life. Just keep it private.
good luck.
I'm glad we can both get what we want.
and please assure the royals when you see them that they won't hear a peep from me.
beer me.
perhaps you'd prefer something a little stronger. It's green.
what are you so relaxed about?
we both know that Gossip Girl's latest hiccup makes you look even worse in Blair's eyes.
maybe today, but at least she knows Dan isn't the good guy he pretends to be.
in time, that'll sink in.
she's not getting out of this royal mess anytime soon.
Oh, but she just did.
that royal minder lady brokered the deal herself.
although the hint of a new scandal could probably derail it if you act fast enough.
Blair will come to her senses.
what if she doesn't?
what if you spend the rest of your days wondering why you didn't try and stop her from falling into the flannelled arms of that pretentious poseur?
Anywho, something to think about.
what do you have in mind?
remember when I showed you this?
how can I trust gossip girl wouldn't leave my fingerprints on another blast?
you can't, which is why we use her latest screwup to our advantage and leave somebody else's instead.
Oh, look. Dan's phone.
it must have fallen out of his coat and into my purse.
I'm sorry, Carol, but I'm gonna have to ask you to let me search your bag.
Laryssa saw you pocketã€‚
Lily, this is beneath even you.
I see some things never change.
the maid accusing my ex sister-in-law of stealing.
William, what a lovely surprise.
doesn't dad look great?
and how are you, Carol? - Under surveillance.
Lily has been shadowing me all afternoon.
that's because I knew you'd try to steal something, and apparently you did.
do you see what I have to deal with, while my own mother lies right here?
all right, carol, I've had enough.
I want you out of my apartment this minute.
technically, it's Cece's apartment.
what are you talking about? - This is our home.
only because your mother bought it for us. Remember?
for tax purposes, of course.
but now it's part of the estate.
William, thank you again for coming.
and I would appreciate it if you would leave the settling of mother's affairs to the executor of her estate.
that's exactly what I'm doing.
I am her executor.
and I brought her will.
ladies but as you well know, your mother and I had a long and enduring friendship.
it's just, of all the people for Cece to pick,
I find it curious that she chooses the father of Lily's children.
well, she couldn't very well have asked the father of yours.
there aren't enough D.N.A. Tests in dade county to find him.
I think I'll let you two blow off some steam.
if you'll excuse me.
hi again. I'm Lola, Carol's daughter. The real one.
what can I do for you?
well, I just recently found out that I'm a part of this family, and I was wondering why I was never allowed to know.
so I thought, you know, you've known my mom longer than anyone aside from Lily.
excuse me.
mom, do you mind?
Yes, actually, I do.
you'll let me know when you need me, won't you, William?
miss Blair, I'm so sorry, but Ms. Estee jedi-mind-tricked me into telling her you at wake.
too many secrets lately. I - I feel like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Oh, it's fine. I'm glad Estee found me.
everything's gonna work out perfectly now.
that's not what Mr. Cyrus say.
he's been trying to call you for last hour. Why you no answer phone?
I put it on silent. I'm at a wake.
and you can tell Cyrus he doesn't need to worry.
I took care of the annulment myself.
then why Grimaldis just call him and ask for all the money now?
well, they agreed to waive the dowry as long as I completely stayed out of the press.
maybe princess Sophie read "Gossip Girl" again, then.
please post A.S.A.P. Dan.
I, Celia Catherine Rhodes, of Montecito, California, being of sound mind and body, do hereby declare this to be my last will and testament.
first, I leave my two Andalusian thoroughbreds, "Rickey and Reggie Rhodes, to the valley ranch stables.
second, I leave my Faberge egg collection.
Hey, dad, wait a second. Sorry. I just-I don't want her here for this.
is she bothering you?
she's a con artist, William.
and not a very good one.
nevertheless, your mother invited her to be here, so...
I would like everybody to respect Cece's wishes, okay?
please.
now if there are no more interruptions...
I think you dropped something.
what... Are you insane?
blair's gonna think I actually sent this picture in to "gossip girl."
Duh. That was the point.
we had a deal, Georgina.
you promised to protect me if I didn't tell anyone you were gossip girl.
I sold you out, so start talking.
look, I had fun being gossip girl, but I'm kind of over it.
I'm just glad that the final blast was my masterpiece.
I'm sorry if it ruins your life.
it's not just mine. It's Blair's, the Waldorfs'.
I know. What a mess.
it's like I just took down the entire upper east side.
here comes the bull's-eye.
you Brooklyn Benedict Arnold, I can't believe you.
it was georgina. She's gossip girl.
Oh, you will really say anything, won't you?
Oh, no, that part's true.
well, half true.
I hacked into G. G.'s web site a few months ago when she obviously skipped town and none of you noticed, and honestly, guys, the experience has been wonderful, but it's just as well it's over now.
okay, could you-could you tell her the important part?
I didn't do this.
how does it feel to be set up and lose the person you love for something you didn't do?
Estee! Please.
there must be a way to still salvage our deal with the Grimaldis.
there might be... If there ever was a deal.
I'm sorry?
the deal thing?
estee made it all up with my help, of course.
we knew once Chuck heard you were free again, he'd do something foolish.
of course, even I didn't think it would happen this fast.
anyway, I must get back to Monaco. I have a prince to console.
Cheers.
standing ovation?
why, thank you.
Oh, my god. I was just bitch-slapped by Bridget Jones.
you don't realize what you've done.
I've brought to light the real villain, and let me give you a hint. It's not me.
you bankrupted the Waldorf family.
that's what paying this dowry is gonna do to them.
it was that much?
no.
you left me no choice.
it would be one thing losing Blair because she doesn't wanna be with me, but I only lost her because of something you did.
were you ever really my friend, or was it all just an act so you could keep me in check until you got what you wanted?
Chuck, that is not how any of it happened, and you know it.
you framed me, and in my book, that makes you the bad guy, not me.
what's going on?
ever since the accident, Dan has been trying to keep us apart so you can have you all to himself.
be honest for once in your life. Tell her the truth. She deserves that.
he's absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
11-I leave my collection of early British watercolors to my youngest daughter, Lily.
I'm sensing a pattern here.
Oh, frankly, Carol, I'm surprised it took you this long to realize what mother really thought of you.
Oh, come on, mom. We're almost done here.
no, she knew that she was a greedy, spoiled - Excuse me, lily.
I'm not the one who's been married five times.
ladies... - Most of which was for money.
excuse me.
well, at least I didn't try and embezzle my own daughter's trust fund so I could go shopping at Lululemon.
the truth is, the only reason mother left you those trinkets... - "as for the rest of my estate, all remaining property, artwork, antiques...
is because you pretended to love her and she pretended to love you. - stocks and bonds, bullion...
at least we had an honest relationship. - contents of my safety deposit boxes and assorted holdings...
William, I can't hear a thing.
I leave... To you.
y - you mean Charlotte Rhodes, my daughter.
this is not the real Charlie Rhodes. Lola is.
no, I'm afraid not, Carol.
it says - It says so right here.
Ivy Dickens.
Oh, please. Wait. Look, I never asked Cece for anything.
Oh, no, instead you poisoned her against her entire family and manipulated her into giving you everything.
that's not true.
your grandmother just wanted someone to talk to.
Oh, please. You don't think we can see through all your lies?
you were a terrible actress when we first met, and you still are.
I swear on my life all I ever did was help take care of her.
I mean, I even tried to tell you that she was sick.
Oh, but conveniently failed.
look, will you please shut up?
forget about the money.
that's easy for you to say.
you each still have your trusts.
mine was liquidated years ago.
how do we know Ivy didn't try to hasten our mother's death?
are you people crazy?
look, I loved her.
that's my cue. I think I've heard enough.
this...
you can think whatever you want about me.
but I never lied to Cece.
prove it.
well, didn't you hear the will?
she didn't call me "Charlie Rhodes." She called me "Ivy Dickens."
your mother knew all of my secrets, and she knew all of yours, too.
maybe that's why she left me everything.
ever since the accident, I've been blaming myself, blaming Louis, but it was Humphrey behind it all.
it's not that simple.
Yes, it is, and now that we know the truth, there is nothing in our way.
Humphrey's not the reason we're not together, and neither is the dowry.
is this about saving my life again? Because we're past that.
you said you wanted to wait until your marriage was over.
now it's over.
Chuck, I don't blame you.
and as crazy as this all has gotten,
I know why you did everything.
because I love you.
and I love you.
I always will.
but that doesn't mean I'm in love with you.
at least not right now, not the way you need me to be, not the way you deserve.
I'm sorry. I have to go.
look, I know how that must have seemed up there, but ivy dickens is a thief.
she already stole your identity and your money, and now she's about to rob the rest of us.
your family needs you right now.
you're not my family, and honestly, after listening to everybody upstairs, the only person I feel sorry for is Ivy.
she's a criminal.
because your family made her into one.
Serena, all you people do is lie to each other and fight about money, so what's the difference, really?
you know, it was my own fault for sticking around today.
I was dumb enough to think that there might be some answers here for me.
at least now I know I was wrong.
care to join me, for old times' sake?
Oh, cut the crap, William.
you need to fix this.
Cece's wishes are Cece's wishes.
I don't care what she wanted.
today was supposed to be my payday, and you know that.
I understand you're upset.
no, you don't understand a thing.
if you can't find a way to make this right, i'm gonna be forced to resort to other ways to get my money.
like getting a real job?
I've always hesitated going after Lola's father for child support he owes me, oh, almost 20 years.
good luck with that.
do you even know who he is?
I'm looking right at him.
sorry I never told you, but not as sorry as you're gonna be when Lily finds out what we were doing while you were married, unless, of course, you have another idea?
this just is my lucky day.
Spotted-Dr. Van Der Doodsen white as a sheet.
looks like the rules of this Rhodes just changed before his very eyes.
how'd you get past the doorman?
wait. I don't even wanna know.
look, I know no one believes a word I say, but I really didn't mean to hurt you.
you were just collateral damage.
well, if it had been anyone else but me, I might believe you, but we both know you've always wanted to settle the score between us.
you have to understand.
when I decided to stop being gossip girl,
I knew that anyone who knew or found out would have it out for me.
so I realized I'd better start collecting favors to use as protection down the line.
running that picture of you kissing Dan was my golden ticket to use with Chuck down the road.
I'd love one from you, too.
are you using again?
why would I ever make myself indebted to you?
because I have a way that your family doesn't have to pay the Grimaldis a thing, and you get your divorce in the process.
even you can't pull that rabbit out of your hat.
I was gossip girl for two months.
you have no idea the dirt I have on people.
I've been so good for so long, it's time for me to be bad.
I can help you.
let me solve all your problems.
fine.
anything to be done with this.
do what you can, and if you succeed, then I'll enjoy whatever horror you concoct.
believe me, I won't let you down, and you won't let me down, either, when I come back.
Lily, I'm sorry for your loss.
tough day, as they say.
for you, too?
Oh, no, I wouldn't dream of adding to your burden.
Oh, come on. You never have.
it would be a good distraction.
what's wrong?
she walked away from me today, and not like she has done in the past.
it was different.
I feel like she's changing.
I know I didn't die in the car accident, but sometimes it feels like I did.
don't say that. You survived, and it was a miracle.
Yeah. Thanks to saint Waldorf.
you mean thanks to saint Jack.
the doctors didn't tell you?
Oh, it's all such a blur now.
when you were in surgery, there was a complication, and they needed a family member for a blood transfusion, and I gave the doctors Jack's number.
Yes.
you haven't lived until you've tried caramel mousse and chocolate.
are you just gonna ply me with sweets until I cheer up?
because I think I'll probably go into sugar shock before that happens.
I am so sorry. I mean, truly. - No, don't be.
you're about the only good thing in my life right now.
sorry to bother you.
I just felt badly we weren't able to finish our conversation, so I asked Serena for your phone number.
Oh, no. You know, today was a lot for everybody, so...
no apology necessary.
well, I'm at the empire if you need to reach me, okay?
okay. Great. Yeah. I'll call you then, I guess.
Bye.
so after all that, you're really just giving up "gossip girl"?
well, with Chuck and Blair beholden to me, I'm more powerful than ever.
it's time to pass the "gossip girl" baton.
let someone else see if they can outshine me, or at the very least, die trying.
now be a doll and send this for me.
my flight to Monaco is in two hours, and be very careful with this.
there's stuff on this laptop that'll blow people's minds.
bring back pictures.
don't you worry.
Bye.
finally, some peace and quiet.
I'm sorry.
am I interrupting something?
Yes, you are. It's been a long day for everyone. I think it'd be best if you left.
I was just gonna say the same thing...
but to the two of you.
what are you talking about?
this is my apartment now.
that's ridiculous.
you think we're just gonna let you live here.
this all just needs to get sorted out.
naturally.
but you'll have to do it from someplace else.
Oh, and where are we supposed to go?
it's not like we have another apartment in the city.
it's - Yes, we do, Lil. Come on.
I'll just get my things.
Oh, Ms. Serena.
I tidy up later.
no, it's okay.
it was beautiful wake for Ms. Cece.
good-byes never easy.
Yeah, I know, but that's all I seem to say these days.
to my grandma, to jobs, to boys, to everything.
I'm just sick of good-byes.
something new arrive soon.
it always does.
I hope so.
I'm ready for it, whatever it is.
attention, upper east siders.
after everything that happened today,
I've decided I need a little break to catch my breath.
I'm sure you do, too.
but don't worry. I'll be back.
I always am.
well, if you came here to tell me what a horrible person I am, then you're too late. I already know.
that's not why I came.
you got back together with Chuck?
no.
are you... Moving to a desert island where there are no men at all, and you'll be living the rest of your life in peaceful solitude?
no.
I told Chuck he doesn't have my heart anymore.
I realized it belongs to someone else.
uh, so, Dan, are you gonna invite me in or what?
what? - You just said my name.
Dan? - Yeah. You just said it again.
Dan. - Say it again.
and when I return, I bet it'll be a whole new world.
gossip Girl here...
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I would like to cordially invite you to join this summer's group of artists at the Italian Arts and Letters Institute in Rome.
I would never stand in the way of an opportunity like that. You have to take it.
you didn't hear her. Or Chuck.
it was-- it was like she wanted me to leave so she could just spend all summer with him.
I'm saying no. Why?
I can work anywhere. I don't think my relationship can.
it's over. And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high-class prostitute ring, you're gonna walk away from "The Spectator" forever.
my computer's gone. - Gossip Girl. She took it.
how do you know that? - 'Cause we set you up.
the old Gossip Girl hurt people, but I'm different. - No, you're not, Serena.
either way, it's over. The real Gossip Girl is back.
whatever you saw or you think you saw, you can't tell Chuck.
he has a right to know.
do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out?
whatever it is, you can tell me, Blair.
you need to go back into that house.
dad. Oh, my God.
so the car accident was real.
I was lucky to survive it.
but it wasn't an accident.
I'd been threatened. - By who?
very powerful competitor of mine.
I had information on some transactions of his that could've put him away for a very long time.
when his threats didn't work...
you had someone ram your limo with a truck?
dad, you could've gone to the police. You didn't have to
Yes, I did.
he'd made it quite clear that both you and Lily were fair game.
once I realized his threats weren't empty, the only way out was to make him believe he'd already won.
once I got to the hospital that night, I thought that would be my best chance.
so, what, you just... paid some doctor to switch off the machines, and hope Lily was crying so much, she wouldn't notice you were actually still breathing?
what did we bury in that coffin?
Charles... I am here with you now, trying to explain.
Humphrey residence. Blair Waldorf speaking.
Oh, hi, Alessandra. No, he's in the shower. Can I take a message?
got it. Yeah, no, don't worry.
I will tell him the second I see him.
that was your agent. She wants you to reconsider the program in Rome, which is odd because you told me they went with someone else.
uh, well, yesterday, when you ended up with Chuck,
I was a little nervous about leaving for the whole summer.
and I know you told me there's other people there, it's not romantic, but...
come on. It's Chuck.
so you lied to me?
uh, I-I figured you would think I was just some jealous freak if I told the truth.
well, maybe because you are.
but you don't have to be. You have nothing to worry about.
take the offer.
it's an amazing opportunity, and I would never stand in the way of it.
it means the entire summer apart.
but it's not like I can't come visit. Rome is just two glasses of chardonnay away.
call her back. It's not too late to change your mind.
I assure you, there's no need to worry.
the police were never there. The entire thing was a false alarm.
your wife will not find out.
and if you are indeed headed for a third divorce, it will not be due to this.
Nope, no bother at all. Cheers.
I want you out of here today.
after all the fun we've had together?
what would people think if they knew about your side business?
is that a threat?
because I am your main financial backer, and we did sleep together -
sometimes right here in these offices.
so exposing me would only embarrass "The Spectator" and you.
then I'll find another way.
you've done nothing but spread lies and cause trouble since you arrived.
I wanna actually build something here, and I can't do that with you around.
you have no idea what I've gone through to legitimize myself.
I've worked hard for this paper, and I'm not about to step aside.
and as for my other business, I'm really more of a figurehead now.
darling, don't look so disturbed.
there are far worse things than being stuck with the likes of me.
guess what I found out this morning.
B.I know what you're gonna say, but first, I really wanna tell you -
Dan turned down the opportunity to spend the summer in Rome with the world's literary luminaries.
and do you know why?
because he's scared of leaving me here with Chuck.
can you believe it? - Sort of.
I mean, the most important thing in a relationship is trust.
after sex. And hygiene. And earning potential.
wait. What did you think I was going to say?
Oh, no-- I mean, no, it's not important.
nowhere near as important as Dan and Italy and his trust issues.
we should go get coffee, and you should tell me more about it.
wait. Okay.
using a very generous grading curve and rounding up because I like your outfit, that lie was a C-plus at best. What is going on?
it's something I've been wanting to talk to you about for a while now.
I've been posting on "Gossip Girl" as Gossip Girl...
for a couple of months now.
what? How is that possible?
when Georgina left town, she gave me her laptop, and it had a direct link to the "Gossip Girl" server, passwords, the software, everything.
S.you had me at "Georgina. " But I can't believe it. Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know. I felt like it was something I had to keep secret from everyone.
I mean, my best friend, even.
I-I know it was wrong, and I'm so sorry.
I mean, I could've helped. Sealing fates, forging destinies...
like an imperious Greek goddess, imposing her will on the guileless masses.
but I was wondering why Gossip Girl was being so nice to me lately.
and a little off her game. No offense.
wait, so--so you're not mad?
I am furious with you... for not sharing your good fortune and omnipotence.
but... right now I have to go replace my mother's La Mer before she returns from Paris and discovers that I've used it all.
wait. Let me do that for you-- my first act of contrition.
please. You think I'm cashing in your "Gossip Girl" guilt chip on some overpriced eye cream?
I'll think of something more useful.
it's not like I planned any of it.
I needed help, so I contacted an old friend.
in her line of work, she has a network of influential contacts throughout the world.
she utilized them to keep me safe and hidden.
she also kept me informed.
when you needed blood, we had to act fast.
she snuck me back into the country so I could provide it for you.
thank you for that.
there's just so much I wanna know.
I guess now we have time. You can tell me everything.
unfortunately, I'm afraid our time is up.
if the man I'm hiding from were to discover I was still alive, he'd try and kill me again.
or go after you. - Let's go after him.
all you need to know is that as long as I'm still around, we're all in danger.
I was supposed to leave last night, but my departure was delayed because of the commotion you and your friends caused.
it was wonderful to get to see you again.
it's something I didn't think I'd ever be able to do.
but I'm afraid you have to go now.
what... what is this?
you're kicking me out?
and then what? You go and you disappear?
leave me alone again?
it's for your own safety.
I'm sorry.
thank you for meeting me. - What can I do for you, Chuck?
I just found out from an extremely reliable source someone else was after my father right before his death.
I want to know who it was.
that was years ago. Why would a source come to you now?
just look into it. I'll triple your usual fee if you can get me a name by noon.
I'm sorry. I can't help you with this.
not only am I on assignment, but frankly, this seems like a waste of both our time.
if you won't help me, I'll find someone who can.
sometimes, looking for answers only leads to more questions.
Serena, hey. Is Blair up there?
no, she had to run an errand.
I just, uh, I have some news I wanna surprise her with.
and sometimes, you're better off not knowing.
Chuck? I can't really be seen with you right now.
but how are you doing? Are you okay?
I have to find a way to stop my father from leaving tonight.
leaving? But you just found him.
he left to keep me safe. Now it's my turn to save him.
but the best way to avoid giving an answer is to avoid the question altogether.
is my mother back? Did she notice the eye cream already?
no, it's actually Dan. He's waiting her with big news to surprise you with.
I'm with Chuck.
B. - No, it's not like that.
he needs me. He's going through an extremely difficult time right now.
Yeah, of course he is, especially if it means taking you away from Dan to be with him.
and you just told me Dan is having trust issues.
I know, but this is life or death.
and other than not being able to say where I am, what I'm doing, or who I'm waiting for,
I honestly have nothing to hide.
well, Dan needs you, too, and you can't be two places at once.
you're right. I'll be right there.
whatever news he has, I'm sure it won't take too long to relay.
Chuck... I'm sorry.
I want to stay, but something came up. Do you mind if I...
Diana will see you now.
I can handle this part on my own. Thanks for waiting with me.
I don't suppose you came here to thank me?
thank you for what?
not telling me my father was alive, pretending to be my mother, or screwing my best friend?
you mean for keeping your father alive, pretending to be your mother to protect him, and...
well, I don't expect you to thank me for Nate.
perhaps I should thank you for that one.
look, I'm not here to hug it out or bond over my father's resurrection.
I just need your help in keeping him here.
I'm afraid that's not possible. - I think it is.
you've been helping him hide. I think you know who from.
who tried to kill my father?
I know it was one of his competitors, someone powerful enough to scare him into hiding these last few years.
I just want a name.
does your father know you're here?
if you really wanna help him, help me put an end to this.
if I do agree-- and only if-- you can never say who told you.
and... I'll need something else from you.
it's not a small request.
the price is no concern. I need this to happen as fast as possible.
make them an offer they can't say no to, and offer them more.
make this happen now.
hungry? - Thirsty.
Blair asked me to come check on you. Everything okay?
Blair asked you to do that?
Oh, I owe her a favor or 12.
I don't need a babysitter.
besides... He already has one.
I am so sorry! Serena told me you were waiting.
I had to go to five different stores to find the right eye cream.
no, don't worry about it. I was just catching up on some reading, - which is actually for you. - A Rome travel guide?
Yeah, I talked to Alessandra, who talked to the people at the program, and they said I can still go to Rome if I want.
but the best part is, you can come with me.
all summer?
Yeah. We would have to meet with an alumnus from the program since the chairwoman is already on her way back to Italy.
you know, I mean, it's a small group, so they have to vet everyone's plus-one.
of course. It sounds reasonable.
only thing is, the interview would have to be today since it's so last-minute.
so what do you think? Huh, spend the summer with me in Italy?
what is she doing here? Has she come to you for help?
Nathaniel, can I speak with you privately?
just a moment, please. - Take your time.
you still want her out, right? - Yes.
Lola and I are coming up with a plan.
there's no need to scheme. I've taken care of it.
there's a paper in London which is in need of a face-lift.
I've arranged for Diana to take it over at a bargain basement price.
wait. She didn't want to leave. What else did you promise her?
that you wouldn't expose her previous profession.
let her leave with her reputation still in tact.
so she gets everything she wants? Where's the justice in that?
there's justice in getting what we want you wanted Diana out. I got her out.
and it's good business for me.
now all I need to do is finalize the deal.
Hey, B.Diana's here and so is Nate. It's super tense.
you have to tell me what's going on.
I can't, S. I'm sorry.
but text me what Chuck's mood is like when they leave.
that way, I'll know if I'm needed.
What--what was Dan's big surprise? - It was more of an ambush.
he got into this writing program in Rome, and he wants me to go with him the whole summer.
Oh, how dare he! Blair, that's amazing.
I told him I had to check my calendar to buy some time to think.
Oh, what's there to think about? Rome for the summer sounds like a dream.
well, not for Romans. The whole place will be crawling with Americans.
and you can be two of them.
but it's a big decision, and after spending last summer at Louis' side,
I was hoping to do my own thing.
so your indecision has nothing to do with Chuck?
absolutely not.
my concern for him at this time is about something entirely unrelated.
which you can't tell me about. B.I hate being out of the loop. Come on!
it's simply not up to me to tell. Sorry.
but text me with updates as to how he's doing.
so is she taking the offer?
getting everything she wants. She's done nothing but lie to us.
now she's being rewarded for it.
well, at least she'll be gone soon.
Yeah. We should probably warn London.
I mean, she's gonna be playing the exact same games over there, and there's not a thing we can do to stop her.
maybe we can.
Chuck agreed that you wouldn't out Diana's secret. But he didn't say anything about me.
so... what's the verdict?
I'm in. - Great!
I'll call the liaison with the program to see when he can come over.
after all your father's done to protect you, I would hate to see this end in tragedy.
are you sure you want to know who tried to kill him?
Yes, I'm sure. And we have a deal.
all right, then.
one of your father's fiercest competitors with known ties to organized crime...
and a liking for twins.
I don't care about his sex life. - Ah, but you should.
he's quite the family man, demands the utmost discretion.
now I'm scheduled for two of my girls to pay him a visit.
if someone were to catch him in the act, that someone would have extremely valuable blackmail material.
if your father knew, I doubt he'd approve.
which is why not telling him is part of the deal.
right. Standing appointment. The James Hotel, skyline suite. 4: 00 P. M.
he's gonna come alone. He doesn't want anyone to know about this.
and that includes his henchmen.
pleasure doing business with you.
mm, that's odd. It's my friend from the "Times.
she can't possibly know about our little deal yet -
unless my phone is tapped, which I wouldn't put past her.
you don't say. An anonymous tip?
Yes, I suppose that would be quite the scandal, if it were true, but... hang on.
the deal is off, and you can forget about using my girls.
marlene, you can't say a word of this to anybody...
they say the truth will set you free, but some truth comes at a price.
what have you done?
okay, someone has to tell me what's going on here.
we couldn't let her get away without any consequences.
she's done nothing but deceive all of us, including you.
it just wasn't right.
Yeah, we're sorry we messed up your deal, but this was beyond business.
it was personal. - You no idea how personal.
I made that deal with her so she would help get my father out of hiding.
wait. Your father-- you mean Jack?
Bart. He's alive.
the bone, Dorota? Really?
our guest is Italian. I don't think that beige plates are very la dolce vita.
you don't think this is - this is too much? And it's just an interview with one person.
well, we want to impress him, right?
I think they're just trying to make sure we're a sane, stable couple.
I-I guess they've had some trouble in the past.
apparently, Padma Lakshmi and Salman Rushdie broke up during their stay...
and it caused all kinds of drama.
you know what? You're right. This is all wrong.
Yeah, it's a little overboard.
no, it's not enough. We don't want pastries. We want gelato.
what?
but it's important for us to show how much we love Italian culture, and what says that better than gelato?
I go get gelato, miss Blair.
no. It's okay. I will do it, Dorota.
you never get the right flavors anyway.
no one likes pistachio anything.
but, you know, we have an hour. I'll be back in plenty of time, I promise.
so all these years, he never made any attempt to contact you?
or my mom? - Too risky.
if my memory serves me right, Lily was in the process of leaving him for Rufus.
he only came out of hiding to save me after the accident.
I was hoping to return the favor, but your little girlfriend ruined that plan when she exposed Diana.
I hope she feels justice has been served because she cost me my father.
Hey, ease up. She didn't know about Bart. None of us did.
well, is there anything we can do to help?
I'm not sure.
once this guy shows up, and Diana's girls aren't there, he's gonna know something isn't right.
I need to come up with a new plan fast.
you don't need a new plan. You just need new girls.
and since you have a Juilliard actress at your disposal, and one who wants to fix what she broke...
I'm sure she'd love the chance to make things right.
wonderful.
just tell her it's a non-union job.
while we rehearse, you go after Diana and make sure she doesn't cancel her client's appointment.
we don't want to put on a show to an empty house.
hurry. We only have an hour. You're gonna need every minute I can spare.
Bart, it's Diana.
start getting ready. You're leaving earlier than scheduled, and I'm coming with you.
Oh, and I hope you've got that check for me.
stall
where is she? We have to get going.
you said you needed twins, right?
or at least two blondes around the same height.
Ivy owes me.
I'll do whatever it takes to help.
I'd love to get back in the gang.
but... just to clarify, in order to be "back in the gang," you would've had to be in the gang to begin with.
we don't need Ivy. I can do it.
after all, B.you have that thing you need to get to.
actually, I have a different acting job for you -
a part you know better than anyone.
Mr. Daniel Humphrey, this Mr. Emilio Pivano.
thank you for coming on--on such short notice.
it's a pleasure to meet an esteemed alumnus of the program.
I read your book. Not a bad debut.
easy to see the potential.
thank you.
how many people were you expecting?
only you. Uh, that's just my girlfriend Blair.
she loves variety and themes. In fact, funny story
um, being that the program is in Rome, she wanted us to have gelato, so she--she went out to get some since we didn't have any here.
knowing, uh, miss Blair, she go to Chelsea market for best gelato in city.
and, I mean, what--what says "Italy" better than, uh, gelato?
Sh-she'll--she'll be - she'll be back in just a moment.
sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic. Babe, I'm sorry.
I'm Blair Waldorf. So nice to meet you.
looks like S. is B. S.ing as B.
let's hope this works. There's no place like Rome.
where is the gelato?
I actually didn't even like him at first.
I thought that he was annoying and unpopular and from Brooklyn.
and I would, uh, antagonize him on a daily basis.
we--we really couldn't stand each other for years.
but it's like a movie now, you know, because we're just madly in love.
mm, not-not--not that madly. It's a--it's a-- it's a calm, stable love.
We're--we're very secure in it. We don't have to worry about it.
Yeah, yeah, it's like we were meant to be.
like Brad and Angelina once they got rid of Jennifer.
Yeah, I mean, not that dramatic. Obviously, there was no Jennifer.
you'll have to excuse Blair. She's not really feeling herself today.
you know, the point is, if Dan is in Rome, I wanna be in Rome.
that sounds wonderful.
you two make an...interesting couple.
uh, excuse me one moment. I have to take this call.
where the hell is Blair?
if she didn't want to come to Rome with me, she should've just said so.
something came up.
is she with Chuck?
no. Of course not. She's with Eleanor.
but she knows how important this is to you, and she wants to go, so she sent me in her place.
well, you're not really helping.
he just said we make an interesting couple.
not in a good way.
I cannot believe that Blair would do this.
what could be more important?
I handpicked these myself.
you really want us to wear one of those?
if it helps to get into character.
or you can have him choose your outfits and stay clothed for now.
okay. When Nevins shows up, take charge immediately.
remember, you are pros. You call the shots.
what if he wants to touch us?
SWAT his hand away and tell him "no."
treat him like the dog he is.
how do you know this will work?
you think this is the first time I've entrapped someone with prostitutes?
every good girl has a pair.
now when the time is right, Chuck will burst in and take pictures, and then your work here is done.
and if you get his clothes off before you cuff him to the bed, it'll make things a lot easier.
what are you doing here?
came to say a proper good-bye.
sorry. Short on time.
besides, what about your girlfriend?
that's not what I meant.
your friend from the "Times" is on her way here now.
she seems interested in hearing what I have to say.
why would she believe you?
I made a copy of your day planner. I can explain the code.
you don't understand. I have to reach Bart.
as if you care about anyone but yourself.
I made several bad choices early on in life.
but I wanted to escape that world and start fresh.
The"Spectator" is my shot at doing that, and...
being here with you...
it's the happiest I've ever been.
I don't believe you.
you lied to me from the moment we randomly met in Los Angeles, and you're lying to me now.
I never lied about my feelings to you.
I think in your heart you know that.
Nate, I can't go back to my old life, and I stand no choice of starting a new one with my name in the headlines.
must you keep me here to humiliate me on top of all that?
I apologize for cutting this short, but I think we've covered everything.
thank you for coming by. I'm sorry if we wasted your time.
not your fault. Lucia insisted we do this.
but I'm sure you'll both have a nice time in Rome.
just watch out for pickpockets. Che bastardi.
wait a second. I'm sorry. Are you--are you saying that, we got in?
of course.
this was just a formality, and if I didn't have a deadline to meet for my new novel,
I would love to sit around and chat more with you guys.
you really do make a lovely couple.
a lot of energy, that one.
hello.
I'm Eleanor Waldorf.
you have a lovely daughter.
I can see where she gets her beauty from.
okay, thank you so much for coming, but don't forget that deadline, buddy.
Serena, how are you?
Hello! I am good. Thank you.
uh, wh-where's Blair?
I haven't seen her yet.
excuse me.
so what if we, like, lay down on the bed in a sexy pose?
Yeah. But I don't know.
maybe we could just, like, stand here and look sexy.
when we were doing all those crazy exercises in acting class, who would have thought that we'd end up here?
holding an imaginary orange in our hands.
Oh, God. He's here.
whatever.
are you Diana's girls?
strip down to your underwear and get on the bed.
you don't understand.
we heard you like it rough.
what do you want your safe word to be?
I am not the client.
Chuck sent me.
you're in danger, and so is Bart.
Nevins got wise to your plan.
Chuck's on his way to see Bart now, and we're supposed to regroup there.
he said that you would know the way. - I do, yeah.
well, good, cause we really need to go. Come on.
I wish you would have told me earlier you were having your P. I. take the pictures.
I told the girls you would be doing it.
I am. What are you talking about?
andrew Tyler. I saw him get into an elevator as I came down.
you didn't send him? - I didn't send Andrew anywhere.
where could they have gone?
Uh-oh, Chuck. You might need to have your private investigator investigated.
so I'm a little confused.
first, Blair says she's running out to get gelato, and then you say she's with Eleanor, and then Eleanor says she hasn't seen Blair all day.
so where's Blair?
she's with Chuck.
I knew it. - I know it's hard, Dan, but you're gonna have to trust her.
how am I supposed to trust her around Chuck when I know she doesn't love me?
I mean, that's the real reason she doesn't wanna come away with me.
I'm sorry. That's--I-I should talk about this to someone else.
no, I-I can handle it.
I told Blair I loved her, and she didn't say it back.
Dan, you know how many times she's been burned by that word.
first, Chuck took a year to say it, and then Louis said it too soon.
I know how much she cares about you.
she may not have said it then, but she will.
even if that is true, that doesn't change the fact that she lied to me.
this lie is different.
it's... It's life or death.
come on. I know you Upper East Siders are partial to hyperbole, but it's
not this time.
Bart Bass is alive.
what?
Hello?
well, this is the room he was in yesterday. Maybe he changed rooms.
you stay here. We'll go check.
how about I come with you-- for protection?
Oh, wait. Here he comes.
what the...
surprised to see me?
until you found out I was still alive.
leave us.
you were the last person I saw before the accident.
you got out of the car right before it happened.
when Blair told me she saw you at the hotel earlier, I started thinking.
it wasn't a competitor that tried to kill him.
it was you.
you hired me to gather intel on Nevins, and I did.
a lot of it.
but he found out, and he threatened me and my family.
it was either you or them, so I turned.
told him I'd work for him.
and to prove my loyalty, I helped get you out of the way.
I told them where you'd be-- in the car, and they told me when to get out.
did you get all that? - Every word.
officers?
I guess now the police know the truth.
you'll be sticking around.
when you care about someone, you want them to stay.
come in.
someone from the "Times" is here.
Yeah, tell her Diana's already gone, and she took her book day planner with her.
but sometimes, showing you care means letting them go.
hi - hey.
how'd everything go? - Pretty great, considering.
Bart Bass is alive and safe.
Chuck stayed up there with him. They're talking to the police.
and Ivy and Lola?
you would have been proud, if you liked either of them.
but if Lola hadn't texted where they were going, we might not have ever beat them up there.
well, maybe I should give her some more credit.
well, thanks for covering for me with Dan.
I called him on the way back. He said we're going to Italy.
well, that's great news, isn't it? - Of course.
I...
I just hope they're not disappointed with the real Blair Waldorf when they meet her.
Oh, they never could be.
but you should probably know you volunteered to teach English at a local school while you're there.
well, I guess I can't spend all my time shopping on the Via Condotti.
you could only stare up at the Sistine Chapel for so long.
Thanks, S.
you really are my best friend.
I love you, B.
I love you, too.
speaking of which, maybe it's time to tell Dan how you feel about him?
he told you about that?
I'm not ready.
I really want the next person I say it to, to be the last.
you're packing to come home, right?
right.
now that we have Tyler's confession, we can get Nevins.
and I can show my face again.
I wanna thank you, son.
I didn't think this was gonna be possible, but the way you took control, got me out of this mess, makes me think I did something right in raising you.
I think we both know you didn't raise me.
you were too busy with all those inappropriate transient women to teach me any viable life lessons...
except those about inappropriate transient women.
I will have to lay low, hire security.
we'll take care of it together, like a family.
speaking of which, what about Lily?
have you thought about how you wanna break the news to her?
I'm not sure.
my relationship with Lily was on the rocks.
you and I were going through a difficult time.
maybe hiding all these years was easier than facing things head-on.
well...
how about we try group therapy next time instead?
so how did Diana get away? What did she do, go out the window?
wouldn't put it past her.
but whatever happened,
I don't think we'll see her again.
Oh, good.
then I get your full attention. - Yeah.
Blair, it's three months.
we can't spend the entire summer living at the Hotel de Russie.
well, of course not.
we also have to stay at the Portrait Suites, which is right above Ferragamo.
of course. That may be more for me.
do you really wanna spend the entire summer with me in Rome?
Chuck's dad is alive. That is gonna change his world deeply.
his, yes, but not mine.
I understand why you did what you did today, but I need to know, for me, for us...
what is really happening here?
there is nothing I want more than to spend the summer right by your side.
where are you going?
I just realized that somebody should probably break the news about Bart to my dad.
well, then I will start researching restaurants.
we have 3 months. That's 90 days, which is 270 meals.
I may need to create a spreadsheet.
you want camomile tea before bed, miss Serena?
I just make for miss Eleanor, catch up on all the gossip, watch "Toddlers & Tiaras."
please, no more tiaras of any kind.
you have smile in eyes.
it's so nice to see you away from that computer.
Yeah, the computer's gone, and I finally feel like I'm getting my life back, and my friends back, too. Feels good.
it's probably Blair now.
evening, Upper East Siders.
many of you have complained I've been too kind to S. and B. these last few months.
but all of that's about to change...
because I've got a page from Blair Waldorf's diary, where she tells all about who's really in her heart.
and there's lots more where that came from, courtesy of her B. F. F. S. V. D. W.
gossip Girl here...
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Bart. He's alive.
what about Lily? Have you thought about how you wanna break the news to her?
where exactly are you gonna find some other Upper East Side woman to take care of you the way I have?
you just made my decision for us to spend some time apart that much easier.
I'm with Chuck. He needs me.
he's going through an extremely difficult time right now.
my computer is gone. - Gossip Girl. She took it.
how do you know that? - Either way, it's over. The real Gossip Girl is back.
do you really wanna spend the entire summer with me in Rome?
there is nothing I want more.
I've got a page from Blair Waldorf's diary where she tells all about who's really in her heart.
good morning, Upper East Siders.
how do you look today?
you know image is everything.
Oh, it's so great to hear from you, David. I would love to work together on another movie.
Yeah, I'll look out for my premiere invitation.
see you then. Bye.
but under those perfect clothes and perfect smiles, everyone has their not so perfect secrets.
I take it you've decided to ask Lola to move in for the summer.
she sleeps here every night. I wanna see her every day. I figure, why not?
this place could use a woman's touch. - Couldn't we all.
lucky for me, nothing can stay hidden forever.
have you heard from Lily?
no. Nothing.
whether the truth's in a diary or the daily news...
once it's out, it will change everything.
let the chips fall where they may... along with the husbands and boyfriends.
it's bad enough you read my diary, but to publically expose my naked thoughts is unconscionable!
B.I was never gonna publish them. I just wanted to know that I could.
I was upset about you and Dan. And I'm so sorry.
I never thought Gossip Girl would steal my computer with everything on it.
well, I took Dan's phone just so he wouldn't see anything.
but I'm just postponing the inevitable if she keeps releasing pages.
I wouldn't worry about Dan. He's a writer.
he knows that diaries are all about exploring your thoughts.
like all terrible things you said about me... that's not how you really feel.
it is now.
another day of wedding planning where my mother needs to make me small so she can be the star.
there goes that relationship! No big deal! Who needs a mother?!
you better find a way to stop this before I lose everyone I ever cared about.
I will, right away.
we need to find every damning thing I ever wrote so we can be proactive about damage control.
every damning thing since grade school is a lot of damning.
do you wanna steam laundry in Siberia?
mobilize the troops!
I know you wanna talk to me about something, but can I go first?
Yeah, sure. What's going on?
I got a job as a swing in the touring company of "Wicked."
a swing? What's that? Like a part or a prop?
it's like an understudy but for a lot of characters.
it's not exactly my dream, but with my mom in jail, it solves my summer housing problem.
well, I know housing's an issue, but you don't have to leave New York.
I don't want to leave you either, but even if I could afford to stay here, I'd never find an acting job that paid enough.
it's best option. I have to get to my fitting, okay?
all right, well, I, um...
you wanted to talk. I'm sorry. I'll come over as soon as I'm done, okay?
I appreciate everything F. H. P. did for Stella.
I'm just not sure that it's the right path for me.
all right, talk soon.
Blair, darling, why is Dorota carrying your life history?
suffice it to say that I apologize in advance if any of your meetings today are negatively affected by the publication of my intimate musings.
thank you.
my mother considers herself an arbiter of Parisian style, but the only French she is intimate with are fries.
well...
the reflections of an over privileged and unattended 13 years old have no bearing on the business I'm in town for, which I have to discuss with you.
I would love to, just as soon as I get my own business in order.
pages with foot and mouth already marked from "K" to 6.
what are you waiting for?
every minute is another bridge burned.
why should we help you when you called us "back of house"?
that was you.
um, she says my hair is as thick as Jessica Simpson's.
that says "head."
you should be grateful that your names are mentioned at all.
that guy spent one week with Marilyn, and he is still living off the royalties.
your grandchildren will brag that their ancestors were belittled by Blair Waldorf.
fine. What do we have to do?
if you're calling to yell at me about Blair's diary, I know.
I'm sorry. I know I deserve it.
but I am doing everything I can to get Gossip Girl to stop posting any more of it.
wait a second. Gossip Girl has Blair's diary?
that's not why you're calling? - No, no.
uh, my dad was trying to reach Lily, and I was wondering if you'd spoken to her since...
Bart's resurrection.
no, I left her a couple messages last night, but I haven't heard from her.
I'm sorry. I have to go deal with this Blair thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, about that... - just be the bigger person and don't read any of them.
stay off "Gossip Girl," okay?
Serena hasn't heard from Lily? - No, she hasn't.
is that Lily getting back to you? - No, it's my lawyer.
I asked him to find out what Bart's reappearance means to my marriage.
And?
Lily and Bart never got a divorce, so technically they're still married.
wait, wait, wait. What?
one of Lily's marriages has to be annulled.
I wanna make sure it's not mine. I gotta go.
deceiving you was the only way to keep you and Chuck safe.
if I had known, maybe we could've done things differently.
you mean you would've come with me.
please. You were getting ready to leave me for Rufus.
I'm sorry for that.
I should've had more respect for our marriage.
what about Charles?
I mean, uh, his thinking you were dead was hell for him.
he got through it, though, with your help.
he told me about the adoption, Lily.
I owe you everything for that.
Charles is family.
and even with you back, he's mine, too.
and now here we are, technically still married, with a son that we legally share.
I can't deny the fact there's a part of me that would...
like to move back in here, repair the damage to our relationship...
a great deal of which I am responsible for.
you know, Bart, I have some wonderful memories...
I know. I know. You've moved on.
you are... happily married to Rufus.
I'm sorry. It was foolish of me to think that you'd ever choose me over him.
status report. Penelope... social suicide watch.
the Met's not gonna be happy. - Make a donation.
also include the ballet, opera. Skip M. O. M. A.
tim Burton isn't art. I stand by that statement.
Jessica, you are on restaurants. I need to be able to eat in this town again.
start by apologizing at per se and work your way down to Boulud Sud.
Kati, regarding fashion, tell Diane that when I said her wraps looked like they were for falafels, that I meant it as a compliment.
what could be more interesting than saving my future?
your past.
this is all Serena's fault! She said she would fix it. It just made it worse.
go.
not you. I have a new task for you.
I'm not comfortable kissing Dan.
I'll manage matters of my heart.
you find every secret Serena has.
I need the best one, to destroy her.
I just hope Chuck and Dan don't see this.
for my father's press conference this afternoon, make sure you only have hard sources...
the "Times," "The Journal. " No Perez.
what is it?
this new romance with Dan is fun, but is cultural stimulation enough?
what if I never love anyone more than I Chuck?
looks like someone forgot a "d" at the end of that word.
question is, is there room for two?
Dan? Hello, it's me!
do you want to come with me to the Shepherds' divorce party tonight?
I should've known that marriage was doomed when Serena banged my boyfriend at the reception.
you saw "Gossip Girl.
you wanna reimburse me for my new phone? 'Cause I'm assuming it's you who took the old one.
I swear, it was just a fleeting thought that I jotted down the day before our hotel room incident.
and drunk elevator sex changed all that.
I would have edited it out of my biography had it not already been posted for posterity.
what you wrote wasn't about sex. It was about your feelings.
my feelings about our impending sex, which no longer apply.
Blair, I told you I loved you, and you pretended like you didn't even hear me.
well, Dan, let's just put all that behind us.
you're... you're doing it again.
do you even want to be in this relationship? - Of course.
is the reason you can't say you love me because...
you're still in love with Chuck? - No.
then I need to know how do you feel about me, by tonight. - Dan.
we're supposed to be spending the summer in Italy together, and I don't want you coming unless I know where we stand.
sorry that took so long. I'm here to talk now.
there's actually someone you need to talk to first.
dad!
your roommate said I would find you here.
you look great.
well, is everything okay? Did something happen with mom's case?
no, I'm afraid her future is still pretty uncertain.
but I don't want yours to be, so I've arranged for Carol's half of Cece's estate to be transferred to you.
this is a lot of money.
you know what it means, right?
I can pay for school. - And not be an Oompa Loompa understudy.
you can stay in New York... And live with me.
did you just ask me to move in with you? - I believe he did.
you can say no if you want, but you can't make the excuse that you don't fit into my world anymore.
it's your world now, too.
well, this is my mom's money. I can't make any decisions until I talk to her.
Rufus, you're looking well.
I see the transition from Brooklyn to the bigtime has done you wonders.
I'm, uh, not here for small talk.
I just need you to sign these annulment papers.
so...
Lily has chosen to end our marriage in order to save yours?
she made her choice three years ago when she decided to leave you for me.
nothing's changed since then. - Maybe I have.
all that time in hiding made me realize what's really important.
what does... what does that mean exactly?
that if Lily's happiness depends on my signature on these, you will have them by the end of the day.
thank you.
I just got off the phone with David O. Russell's assistant.
my invitation to the premiere was rescinded...
I've always found him an intelligent filmmaker.
because Gossip Girl posted a diary page about how I never read "The Beautiful and Damned,
so I just pretended to to get the job.
well, maybe you should've considered that before you leaked my diary.
it wasn't in your diary.
not the ones you found, but it was on the page I just wrote and emailed to Gossip Girl when I saw your invitation.
Blair, you knew how important that job was to me, and...
and I was on the verge of getting another one.
summer job on a film set versus exposing all my secrets.
no, I'm not sorry.
I'll never love Chuck again after what he did tonight.
he's a monster. He deserves to be alone forever.
I was waiting for that one.
you happy now, now that I'm as alone as you are?
well, I'm only alone because of you.
you... you had your prince and you had Chuck.
you didn't need to take Dan, too.
I didn't "take" Dan. That's not how relationships work.
you would know that if you'd grown up at all since high school.
Oh, come on, Blair. You're the one who can't move on.
you... you're still in love with Chuck and you still won't admit it.
get out.
I mean it. I want you gone for good. Pack your things.
you can't hold me responsible for everything bad in your life.
I can because you are.
the best time I ever had was when you were gone six years ago.
leave your key with Dorota.
well, it's about time William gave you my money.
I was starting to worry he'd made some secret alliance with Lily.
I guess it just took a while to arrange everything.
but now we can hire you a great defense lawyer.
I already have one. Abrams & Weil took my case pro bono last week.
apparently, one of the partners read about me in the New York social diary.
just out of the blue like that?
well, that's great, mom.
then why aren't you smiling?
this money is a good thing.
go tell Nate you'll move in with him.
don't turn your back on the life that...
I almost screwed up for you.
I am proud of you, son.
Lily told me you'd stepped up, but I had no idea how much you accomplished.
thank you. How was seeing Lily after all this time?
I never dealt with such a formidable woman.
made me regret not treating her better.
they do require dedication.
I assume you're talking about Blair Waldorf.
but you two aren't back together?
I made a lot of mistakes after you left.
I lost my temper. I... lost myself.
when I finally realized what I'd done and I had the ring to propose, I...
I was too late.
and then she married a prince. - Now she's with Dan Humphrey.
or at least I think she is.
I don't really know how she feels about either of us.
so... what are you waiting for?
chances like this don't come around by often.
and no one does a grand, romantic gesture better than a Bass.
of course I didn't have anything to do with your mother's new lawyer.
Carol still won't speak to me.
but if you need any help paying their fees, I'll contribute. Everyone deserves a defense.
well, the firm is working for free.
and if I needed money, I have my mom's half of Cece's estate.
that's right. William... uh, well, your father mentioned that.
excuse me, miss Lily. I have delivery from your attorney.
thank you, Vanya.
Bye.
- Is everything okay? - I'm not sure.
would you mind letting yourself out?
make sure they know the Q&A will be limited to ten minutes only on specified subjects.
that's all for now.
what are you doing here?
I... came to check on you.
gossip Girl's been putting a bunch of stuff up, and I wanted to make sure that you weren't hurt.
why would I be hurt about something that was in your diary a year ago?
we've been through so much since then, talked about everything, made amends.
or is there some other reason you're here?
maybe to tell me you and Dan broke up?
no. We haven't.
I can't play this game anymore, Blair.
I spent the whole year waiting for you.
I need to move forward with my life now.
of course. You're right.
unless there's something else you need to say.
I have to go.
blair's dirty work can wait.
she fired me.
I'm on my way to meet everyone at Michael Jordan's steakhouse for the Shepherd" divorce party.
Oh, well, there's been a change of plans.
you're not going to that, and neither is Blair, and you and your friends are going to see to it.
that's the problem with hired help.
they'll work for anyone.
you look just as beautiful in black as you did white.
you look dapper. - Oh, thank you. You look beautiful.
Blair texted me that she would be here, so I'm... I'm feeling a little bit better.
then you should probably stay off "Gossip Girl.
Why? Did I miss another diary post?
she was just spotted at the empire.
come on, she's probably just telling Chuck that... that it's over between them for good, and I bet she's on her way here now.
come on, let's go get you an "aleimony" while we wait.
I appreciate you doing all this.
it's important that the world know you're back.
to new partnerships.
speaking of which... - You didn't need to buy me a gift.
actually, you bought it.
I was at Harry Winston, picking up an apology trinket for Lily.
Helene told me it was in the vault. I thought you might want it back.
Why?
well, isn't Blair still the most important thing in your life?
Where's that last grand gesture we spoke of earlier?
maybe I'll just hold on to it.
Lily. What a present surprise.
Charles, do you mind if I speak to your father alone?
I'll tell everyone we need a few more minutes.
I can't believe how much more grown up you are at your age than I was.
I suppose it's the divorce, and all the other mistakes you've already made.
well, it won't get easier any time soon.
I'm headed for a reckoning... Dan vs. Chuck.
you always did love Jane Austen.
as literature, not my life!
Dan is my best friend. When we're together, it's great.
I feel strong and safe... except in his neighborhood.
and with Chuck?
I'm vulnerable.
H's devastated me, but...
he's also made me happier than I've ever been.
I just don't know which kind of love is better.
you probably think I'm pathetic for even caring.
if I was truly powerful, I'd be content without any man at all.
well, even moguls have hearts, my dear.
trust me, Blair. There isn't a woman out there more powerful than you are.
you really think so? - Yes, I do.
that's why I want you to take over my company.
that's what I've been trying to talk to you about.
I have decided to retire, and I know you've always said you didn't want any part of what I do.
well, have you seen my closet?
fashion is art and culture and history and everything I love combined.
but I'm not a designer.
so your first order of business will be to find the right one to take over.
so what do you say? Will you do it?
will a real Waldorf woman carry on the name?
Yes. Of course yes!
hugs? What did I miss?
knock! Were you raised in a barn?
what are you doing here? I dismissed you hours ago.
then your diary said I was pathetic for showing up everything alone.
so I thought we could go to the Shepherd party together.
but is that what you're wearing?
Serena just left here in exactly the same color scheme.
give me a minute.
two more prenup shots, please. - You know, maybe I should just text Blair.
no. No, don't do that.
that will completely ruin the romance of her showing up to be with you.
what?
what? What happened?
I think... I think Chuck is proposing to her.
well, I'm... I'm so sorry, Dan.
well, maybe it's not what we think it is.
or maybe if it is, maybe she's not gonna say "yes."
after being rejected at Blair's wedding, I don't think Chuck would...
would ever make that move unless he was sure of her answer.
well, then I wanna hear that from her.
sorry. I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. It's okay.
I know somewhere where we can dry off.
what are you still doing here? - Waiting for Blair to change.
she left.
she went through Serena's room to avoid you.
I should've known we'd have communication problems when she stole my phone.
sorry to interrupt your diatribe, but, um, can you unzip my dress?
don't worry. There's a slip underneath. I just can't get it dry like this.
where was I with my diatribe?
Oh, right. Communication.
she tells me that I never shut up, but she's the one that's always talking.
it's not like her to choose Chuck and not say anything.
well, it's exactly like her, actually.
I'm sorry, I just... I can't protect Blair any longer.
all she does is lie and scheme, and she's done nothing but hurt you all year.
I thought she'd changed. - She's never gonna change.
don't you see, Dan? The Blair that you're in love with isn't the real Blair.
it's the one that you created in your book.
and she's always loved Chuck.
she just used you to get between us because she knew that I loved you.
sorry to bother you before your press conference, but you said you wanted to be honest moving forward.
I want nothing more.
was there a problem with the annulment papers?
Oh, I was just surprised, uh, you didn't mention them when we spoke.
that's because Rufus brought them by after I saw you.
I just assumed it was because you'd decided to stay married to him.
I was only trying to honor your wishes, so...
I should've known you'd lure her here.
how'd you do it? Sob story? Diamond necklace?
I should get to the press conference.
I'll give you two some privacy.
how dare you have annulment papers drawn up behind my back.
I tried to call you. You didn't answer.
I wanted to give us a chance to work things out before Bart started causing problems.
our problems long predate Bart's return. You haven't spoken to me in weeks.
you've h... you've had no interest in working on our marriage until you this as a competition with him.
he's manipulating you to choose him.
well, you're wrong.
he signed the papers.
it'll be my choice who I stay married to, not yours.
I am pleased to announce that bass industries will now truly be a family business with the return of the man who taught me never to give up, even on the dead...
my father, Bart Bass.
thank you, son.
Thanks, mom. I've made my choice.
I know who I need to be with.
I'm on my way to tell him now.
of course, none of this would've been possible without my son Chuck.
so thank you, Chuck, for keeping my seat warm.
so starting today, I will be the only bass in bass industries.
thank you. Any questions?
some secrets even I couldn't see coming.
Byebye, baby Bass.
I thought that went well.
What'd you want to discuss?
you said this was a family business. What happened to us being partners?
you said partnership.
I said nothing and did what was best for my company.
the only reason this company still exists is because I saved it.
all I've done is work to protect your legacy.
and pine after Blair Waldorf.
Blair has nothing to do with the way I've handled this business.
you didn't try and trade her for a hotel deed?
you didn't let everything fall apart when you ran away from her all the way to Europe?
you didn't just three months ago almost bankrupt yourself trying to get her out of her marriage?
I had hoped you had outgrown such foolish behavior, but you're still willing to throw everything away for a girl who's done nothing but toy with you.
and you proved that when you took that engagement ring.
you gave me it. You encouraged me to win her back!
it was a test to see if you were ready to be a bass, to do the things you need to do to be a great man, - and you failed. - Failed?
I got you out of hiding.
I took down your enemy.
I built this empire!
no, no, no, no, the most you have done is used my money to redecorate.
bass industries needs to be run by a man, not a boy.
you've never grown up. Maybe you can start now.
well, that was definitely not what I expected to happen tonight.
not that it... it was bad. It wasn't.
Oh, don't sound so surprised. We were always good together.
Yeah, we were, weren't we?
here.
that's weird. Your camera's on.
uh, no, no, it's not. - Whoa, I think it was recording us, actually.
Oh, gosh! Maybe II hit the button when I was cleaning up the spill.
here, let me erase it.
you had Penelope keep Blair home?
you knew that she wasn't with Chuck the whole time.
no. No, that's... that's not true.
she was spotted at the empire. You saw that yourself.
you manipulated me into thinking that I was over so I would cheat on her.
Oh, come on, Dan, we both did this.
what were you gonna do with this? You gonna... you gonna post this video on "Gossip Girl"?
I gotta get out of here.
I don't know who you are anymore.
I'm sorry. - I don't need your pity.
I'm not here because I pity you.
I'm here because it's time I was honest with you.
I love you.
I'm in love with you.
I have tried to kill it, to run away from it, but I can't and I don't want to anymore.
so what? - So now we can be together.
isn't that what you want?
it was, before I lost everything.
bass industries isn't everything.
I'm gonna take over my mother's company, and...
it can be our future.
the only reason Waldorf Designs has a future is because I gave mine up for it.
my father was right.
I always put you first, and you bet against me every time.
now I have nothing.
you have me.
that's not enough.
I need a future.
then let me be part of it.
I don't want to be Mr. Blair Waldorf.
I'm Chuck bass.
poor B. Now that she's revealed what's in her heart, guess these diary's days are dead, along with her happily ever after.
I'm off to meet Jack. Turns out my father cut him out of the company, too.
I'm not surprised. But are you sure you wanna partner with the guy?
I need resources if I'm going to get back what I built and my father stole.
nobody does resource management better than a vengeful Jack bass.
good luck. - I'll see ya.
you sure you don't wanna come tour the northwest with me?
a little fresh air might be good after your last few months.
I would love to hang out with you and nature, but I have worked too hard on "The Spectator" to leave it now. So...
well, I should go then.
I have to finish all the paperwork to donate Cece's estate before I fly out.
wait. Where did you decide to leave the money?
I found a worthy cause.
well, at least an annulment will be easier than a messy divorce.
you sure about this?
I can only have one marriage,
you okay?
that didn't sound too easy.
well, it's, um, a lot easier knowing how supportive you've been.
we both have a lot of making up to do.
I look forward to continuing the process this summer in the Hamptons.
I'm busy.
I never meant for you to get caught in the crossfire of my battle with Blair.
I deleted the video, so no one knows about it and no one got hurt.
and please don't act like you're innocent here.
I mean, it was mutual. We both used each other.
I was trying to escape my own pain, and you were trying to destroy your best friend.
those are two different things.
I'm sorry for how it happened, but I love you, Dan, and I don't think that you would've done what you did if you didn't still have feelings for me.
and now there's nothing standing in the way of us.
Serena, there is no "us. " There's only you.
and... and now that our parents are splitting up, I never have to see you again.
the French say,"plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.
sounds romantic.
Hey, can you meet me? I'm on my way.
but all it means is,"the more things change, the more they stay the same.
sorry I'm late.
you have no idea how many signatures it took for me to get you this money.
are you sure you wanna do this?
Cece gave it to you. I'm just giving it back.
well, thank you.
if you ever need anything...
after Lily sabotaged my mom's defense, I just need you to keep our agreement.
take down Lily.
I'm looking forward to it.
but I thought you were giving away your money so you didn't become like the rest of your family?
I'm not.
you are.
outsiders remain on the outside...
at least for now.
that is your third sigh since the seventh arrondissement.
are you having regrets about leaving without speaking to Serena?
not at all.
those were "I love Paris" sighs.
I can't wait to start discussing heel heights and hem lengths.
good.
I wanna be sure that you're ready for this.
you don't have any loose ends to tie up back home?
nothing's holding me back anymore.
I know what I want, and I'm gonna get it.
the queen B. Ascends to reign over a new kingdom...
number 24 black.
blackjack.
puts us up $3 million.
two more and we'll be able to buy our way into the only game that can really help us take down Bart Bass.
as long as the pit boss doesn't make you for counting cards.
place your bet.
stay at 17.
and the wild cards just keep getting Wilder.
this came from Diana Payne. - Thank you.
Dan Humphrey. Come to whisk me away for a rendezvous under the tuscan son?
you're lucky you're on my free pass list.
otherwise, Philip might've put up a fuss.
this invitation isn't about seduction, Georgina. It's about scandal.
can't a girl have both?
I need your photographic memory and your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side...
the book I should've written from the beginning.
I can hardly wait.
but even the same characters can start to play a new power game...
and old stars can cease to shine.
s. Always said she wanted to be left alone.
now she'll get her wish.
Damian sent me.
do you have what I asked for?
Damian said you like to party.
I'm Zeke, by the way.
I don't care what your name is.
as far as I'm concerned, Serena Van Der Woodsen doesn't exist.
is there a seat available?
Yes. Take mine.
thanks for the call.
you fought for me all year. I've come to fight for you.
will you be joining the game?
you said I always bet against you, but this time, I'm all in.
your bet, sir?
what did I say about letting the chips fall where they may?
see you next fall.
gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
I need your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.
don't just stand there. Start typing.
real names this time, no holding back. Everyone gets exposed.
I have decided to retire.
that's why I want you to take over my company.
I didn't realize how much I missed it, but now that I'm back and I'm with you, New York has never seemed more perfect.
I think it's really brave, you deciding to run "The Spectator" on your own.
no investors, no partners.
wait. Are you here to freak me out or write a paper on... on my paper?
you father gave it to me to keep quiet.
for that amount of money, you must know a hell of a secret.
I swear I don't know what it is, but I'm willing to stick around to find out.
sorry for dropping in after hours, but I was walking by, and I saw that your office light was on.
would you like to have a drink with me?
up and at 'em, upper east siders.
it's important to start your day right.
seems like you were already up.
thanks to you, I've been up all week.
five more minutes.
we might need a little longer.
there's nothing worse than waking up on the wrong side of the bed...
I thought we agreed you'd stop watching me sleep.
I lied. I'm letting you stay here for free.
there has to be something in it for me.
except maybe waking up alone.
why did you let me sleep? !
it's "W. W. D. " Day!
we have to take the fashion world by storm.
first, it's breakfast, then shower, then to the atelier.
I can hardly wait to see what today brings.
I'm booked on the 7: 00 flight to Dubai.
please, just a little more time.
we've spent all week pouring over the notes of every meeting I interpreted for Bart.
there's nothing, Chuck.
look, I know the reason my father faked his death has something to do with this hotel deal.
it has to be here.
we looked. It's not.
then why would he lie about being in Dubai?
why would all the negotiations happen completely off the books?
why would he pay you $10 million not to ask any of these questions?
if he's hiding something, I don't know what.
I'm sorry. I need to get home to my fiancÃ©.
there's nothing more I can do.
you could come to brunch.
with Bart? That sounds dangerous.
you won't have to say a word.
just smile while I drop a few names to see how he reacts.
then you can take your money and go.
you know, I was a very punctual person before I met you.
well, any way I can convince you to be fashionably late to my gala tonight?
I know you have the Crowdrise event, but maybe after?
Nah, I'd love to, but this thing's been booked for months, and who knows how long it'll go?
I don't want to say "maybe" and then disappoint you.
how could you disappoint me when you did so much work to get me on the board in the first place?
I know what a big deal the Central Park Conservancy is.
when my mom was finally asked to host, she made it seem like it was more important than being the mayor.
well, now that you're hosting, it definitely is.
tonight marks the start of a whole new era.
Serena takes Manhattan.
an adult Manhattan.
I couldn't be happier to leave my old life behind.
well, just don't leave me, even if I can't make it tonight.
the renovation is complete.
fabric is all from swatches you choose.
your mother's vintage designs on display.
and this area can be showroom or waiting room, parties or meetings.
form follows function.
and in here...
miss Blair's private office.
this... is... divine.
this is... so me.
this "Women's Wear Daily" article could make or break me as the new head of Waldorf.
and the atelier is the perfect backdrop.
all these years of folding my sweaters and fluffing my pillows have really paid off.
you've developed taste!
Yes.
miss Blair's new samples look lovely.
and I'm glad the office is up to snuff.
but I... I worry if "W. W.D. " will ask, "where are the designers, seamstresses, and models?"
it is unfortunate that my mother's Paris team declined to follow me back to New York, but...
not to worry.
while you were paint and papering, I came up with a plan.
Hello, ladies!
get ready to assume your roles.
go get dressed for success.
your sofa might be chic, but my neck is not happy with this kink.
would you prefer the kink of watching your father do it with fake Charlie again?
no, I did not watch. I got the hell out before they saw me.
the image is still burnt right here.
to think that I used to consider Brooklyn a moral high ground.
now that my father's fallen off his pedestal, I'm free of such delusions.
your loss of faith in humanity turns me on, as does the fact that your book was rejected by Simon & Shuster and you were dropped by your agent.
I still don't get why they didn't want it.
they sent me to Italy to write "Inside Part Two,"
and this time I delivered a real story with real names.
raw, hard facts.
please say "raw" and "hard" again.
who cares about Alessandra and the entire lit set?
they're just book nerds.
revenge is a dish best served serialized, one delicious chapter at a time.
once we find the right magazine, and everyone starts talking, then the book offers will come in.
then the movie, and then the Broadway musical.
check your calendar. We have meetings all afternoon.
Yeah, well, I got an errand to run. I'll see ya at "Vanity Fair."
can't wait to start burning bridges together.
well, thank you for accepting our invitation for brunch, Charles.
you know how important it is to me that we make an effort as a family.
of course. And I do want you both to get to know Amira.
did I mention she speaks seven languages, including body?
numerous times. Micro-expressions, vocal shifts. We get it.
she's "The Mentalist."
eat a crÃªpe.
so how did you two get together?
it's a tale as old as time.
boy meets girl, girl falls for boy and shares her deepest and darkest secrets.
Chuck exaggerates.
um, we both found ourselves admiring the fish-tank at Ossiano.
a classic meet-cute and quite ordinary, I'm afraid.
Amira was attending a business dinner with Khalid Al-Saleh.
you must know him, father. He's big in middle east real estate.
he's developed a few hotels.
doesn't ring a bell. - Really?
because Amira says he knew you.
I doubt very much that Amira discusses her work with you.
she seems like an intelligent woman who understands that her livelihood, if not her life itself, depends on her discretion.
if you'll excuse me, I should confirm my flight for tonight.
you certainly scared her off.
Yeah, I think I'm done also.
I have a meeting with Bruce Kaplan to find out if Bass Industries is finally bouncing back after your reign.
Charles, I know you're upset that your father took his company back, but give him a chance.
he did risk his life to save yours.
and he's not the man he used to be.
Yes, 7:00. That's right. Perfect. Thank you.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
I paid you a lot of money to leave the country.
I'm sorry. Chuck insisted that I come here today.
well, I insist you go.
our weekend together has costed me enough.
don't make me warn you again.
Chuck, I think it's time to go.
what am I supposed to be?
I think it's between nurse and cafeteria worker.
you are a seamstress, whom I will publicly shame with my artistic temperament.
and, Kati, you are a crazed fan, begging to borrow a limited edition.
when the reporter arrives, you will wheel out the dresses with a grand flourish.
reaction to clothes is what really counts.
if article is negative, could poison perception of whole line and jeopardize future of Waldorf Designs.
Kati, start your adulation right now.
O. M.G. Nelly Yuki. Great!
maybe she knows how to sew.
she lost her status as a minion when she stole my spot at Yale.
she knows better than to beg for reinstatement.
Hi, Blair.
"hi"? No "hi." Go!
before the "Women's Wear Daily" reporter shows up and thinks that I consort with fake Dior-carrying wannabes.
actually, this bag was a personal gift from Raf after I wrote an article on him.
after you...
that's right, Blair.
I'm the "Women's Wear Daily" reporter.
thanks for picking up my check in person.
it means a lot for "The Spectator" to sponsor the same event as "The Times."
well, I'm glad you wanna be involved.
just do me a favor and please don't invite Blair.
have you even told her that you're back yet?
this is a long time for you to be mad at Blair just for being Blair.
I'm not mad. I'm maturing.
we're just naturally growing apart.
you know, being with Steven has really helped me to understand who I wanna be.
I hope you find someone like that, too.
you never know. I might have.
What?! Wait. Who?!
I met a girl. Her name's Sage. She's a Columbia journalism student.
she's funny. She's smart. I just...
but it's all very new, so I... I can't talk about it.
shy smile, reluctant eye contact? I think I've seen enough. You really like her.
keep the change. You're gonna love this place.
what, you can't even look at me?
no, no, no. I'm not not looking at you.
I'm looking at her... with your boyfriend.
it really is so good to see you.
you said that already. - Twice.
Blair, please. Please let me wear one of your exclusive designs.
you're supposed to be the seamstress.
go help Dorota make tea, both of you.
welcome back, Nelly!
I see nothing's changed around here since high school.
except you. You look so presentable.
Yes. Once I got into Yale, I realized I didn't have to dress like you anymore.
so let's see your line.
it's not here.
shipping snafu en route from Paris.
you're lying.
if I were, it would only be to protect Waldorf Designs from your biased opinion of me, which is based on nothing but good, clean high school fun.
I still have night terrors about nairtinis and yogurt bombs.
sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, shouting, "tights are not pants!"
but I am not biased. I play fair.
that's why I got into Yale, and you didn't.
did I mention I graduated early?
send another reporter.
it's my story.
and look on the bright side. No matter what I write, readers can see the pictures of your collection next to Poppy Lifton's and decide for themselves.
poppy? That Ponzi-scheming fauxcialite?
the only designing she is doing is with popsicle sticks in the arts and crafts room of a women's prison.
she's a thief.
Blair, that was so four years ago.
my article is called "Society goes sartorial,"
and it profiles two designers, you and her.
we're not photographing anything until tomorrow, so you have until then to decide if you wanna be included.
stop eavesdropping and get in here!
I need recon on Poppy Lifton's collection now.
Hey, it's me. Leave a message.
Hey, Sage, it's Nate.
listen, I've had a lot of fun this week. But you know what? I'm done.
have a nice life.
why did you just do that?
it's too crazy of a coincidence that your Sage and my Steven are seeing each other.
well, we could have completely the wrong idea.
I doubt it.
I've had way too many girls talking me back into relationships I wanted out of.
just like you run away from too many guys you didn't want to confront with the truth.
I mean, maybe it's time we start doing things a little bit differently.
you're right. We've just made terrible relationship choices.
or as Patti Stanger would say, our pickers are broken.
are you really quoting the millionaire matchmaker?
as if you don't watch it.
it's true.
if I really wanna be mature, I should just calmly ask Steven to explain.
on the phone. - Good luck with that.
all right, I've gotta get back to the office.
but, uh, I'll see you tonight.
sorry. I'll have to call you back.
did you have an affair with Amira?
I... spent a weekend with her.
years ago, after I suspected you had been with Rufus.
but I apologize. That's no excuse.
no. However, it explains why she's extorting money from you.
you overheard us talking.
it seemed a small price to ensure that my old behavior didn't get in the way of our new relationship.
well, thank you. I appreciate your honesty.
um, I can't imagine how Charles will feel when he finds out about his girlfriend's agenda.
I suspect that's why he's brought her here.
one second.
I didn't expect to hear from you today. How is the party planning?
uh, good, I think.
is everything okay?
uh, are you seeing someone else?
um, it's... it's okay if you are, because, you know, we never really defined things over the summer.
well, we didn't have to define things. We moved in together.
I know, but, you know, that was in the country.
and, you know, maybe you have something going on here that's a little complicated.
I mean, I would understand if you do, but... but just please tell me the truth.
I'm not seeing anyone else.
but I have to get back to my meeting, so I'll call you later.
Nate. Thanks for calling, man.
Serena's intervention wasn't exactly conducive to catching up.
true, but I know what you were up to this summer.
well, are you referring to my acquired taste for a tuscan red or...
or Georgina cracking the whip?
you didn't really let her, did you?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was a figure of speech.
no, I meant she was being a slave driver about my new book.
that's actually what I wanna talk to you about.
I wanna publish it in "The Spectator."
you... do you know what it's about?
serialized character studies of people on the Upper East Side.
Yeah, using real names.
I get it, all right, but I really need it after I gave up my "Who is Gossip Girl? " exposÃ©.
I don't know.
mixing business and friendship didn't work so well with the film rights to "Inside."
all right, first of all, that was Serena. This is me.
Second,"The Spectator" has an entire print arm now.
I can publish it on multiple platforms.
this could be a defining moment for us.
look, Nate, I'm flattered, but I'm letting Georgina handle the business side.
so if you... if you really want in, you're gonna have to call her.
all right.
why do you look like the "before" pictures of people who need Botox?
you can't be worried that Poppy's collection is better than mine.
actually, it's pretty much the same.
W... what do you mean "the same"?
like, the same... quality?
the same style?
the same, Blair.
she's using that exact... fabric.
Nelly! She set me up!
if I'm in her article, she will write that I copied Poppy.
but then if I'm not, she will showcase Poppy's collection alone, and then everyone will assume that I am the plagiarist!
you're screwed! Sorry.
Nelly got into Yale by playing clean, but no one does dirty better than Blair Waldorf.
those dresses will never be photographed.
Hello, Lily.
Charles, your father told me what you did this morning, and I'm not pleased about it.
are you referring to the fact I didn't finish my eggs or that I forgot to say good-bye when I left?
you brought Amira to our home to extort money from Bart and to wreak havoc on our relationship.
I don't know what my father's told you, but let me assure you,
Amira's presence has nothing to do with you.
well, since they slept together, it has everything to do with me.
I'm sorry, Lily. I had no idea.
I have to go. - Wait.
when were you planning to tell me you had an affair with my father?
poor Chuck. Everyone knows the first place to check for secrets is under the bed.
or in it.
it's terrific, exactly what "The Nation" likes...
literate but a little licentious.
it will rock the Upper East Side and make waves way beyond New York.
genius. It'll be like when people first read Dominick.
I told you. He's the second coming.
and third and fourth if he lets you stay the night.
of course, we'll have to fact-check it.
that could take a while.
Ben's really good friends with the Basses, so there would have to be some cuts, and I'm not talking about their time in tennis camp.
but we just can't open ourselves to a Biro-sized legal suit.
maybe lose the last names?
what is the point of publishing an exposÃ© if you're not going to expose everything?
who cares? They're willing to pay for the version that works for them.
it'll get us both out of Brooklyn.
no, but then I'm compromising my integrity again.
what happened to telling the truth about these people?
save your passion for your poetry, which you can write as much as you want once this makes you rich and famous.
well, I... I did the soft pedal with "Inside,"
and my life stayed remarkably the same.
why is the handsome, vacant one calling me?
if you're referring to Nate, he has a surprisingly high I. Q.
but he... he wants the book for "The Spectator.
okay, no. We're playing with the big boys on this one.
so stop moping and go find yourself a suit you can wear to a bidding war.
you sneak up the fire escape here and smash Poppy's showroom window.
why can't Kati's ex-boyfriend who showed us Poppy's samples just let us in?
so it looks like a random robbery, not a socialite stealing samples.
wear those.
that's my ex. We have a problem.
he told you he's gay, just like everyone else you slept with.
discuss it with your therapist.
no, Blair.
he says Poppy has decided to have "W. W.D. " photograph her collection at the Central Park Conservancy gala.
damn it! That is the perfect backdrop!
not to mention, the clothes will be seen by all the right women.
we need to get there first and intercept.
that might be harder than you think.
Why? I can get an invitation to anything.
Serena's the hostess.
Serena's back? I didn't... know.
I mean... of course I knew.
it's just, the Central Park Conservancy is...
it's the big leagues, yeah.
well, Serena's new boyfriend... got her on the board.
well... good for Serena.
just so happens that I know someone else who can help us.
Bart and I were only together for one weekend.
I didn't mention it because you were investigating his business, not his personal life.
I was looking for his secrets. You count.
but then perhaps he simply paid to hide our affair from your stepmother.
my father would never spend that kind of money on a relationship.
there must be something else connected to that weekend.
I can't imagine what, and I can't risk staying to find out.
then you leave without your money.
Chuck, don't do this.
that money belongs to me and my family.
and it's in my safe, and I won't open it until you tell me everything that happened that weekend.
it's nothing.
use your memory. Use your e-mails. Use your credit card bills.
I wanna know every person you saw, every place you went.
the sooner you write it all down, the sooner you can leave.
now I have to go and help a friend, but I will be back.
Serena. You must be excited about your big night.
Where's Steven? I'm dying to meet him.
Oh, well, he's not coming, which is good, since I just found out he's cheating on me.
Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.
it's Steven.
he just canceled his meeting so that he can come tonight.
how... how am I supposed to face him?
with a smile.
tonight is your entree into adult society. You can't let him jeopardize that.
so I'm just supposed to stand there and act like I don't know he was with someone else?
well, that's the difference between being a grownup and in high school.
now you'd better go get dressed.
it's bad form for a hostess to be late to her own gala.
I just hope there are no more surprises.
hello. - Finally.
I've been trying you all afternoon.
I know. I didn't answer. I thought the message was pretty clear.
wow, I didn't have you figured for the voice mail breakup douche.
what changed since I left your bed this morning?
uh, I found out you lied.
I didn't lie exactly. You know what? I'm coming over right now to explain.
no way. I've been manipulated by that sentence before.
listen, I'm busy at "The Spectator" and I'm already late for the Conservancy gala.
forget the jeans. I need a dress for tonight.
looks like someone's getting dressed to kill...
or at least for a hell of a fight.
good to see you.
Oskar, hello! - How are you?
good, thanks. Do you want to take a picture? - Sure.
I loved your production of "As You Like It."
well, thank you. Thank you. Hope to see you down at The Public soon.
me, too. Take care.
you look beautiful.
you made it. - I know how much it meant to you.
Yeah. It did.
Georgina, what are we doing here? We weren't even invited.
did not having a formal invite ever stop Norman mailer from showing up?
the most powerful publishers in the world are opening their pockets for philanthropy.
we just have to take advantage.
Yeah, except they don't want my material unless I cut and paste and make everyone look pretty.
once I get you your first big deal, then you can go all Hunter S. Thompson on me.
stop whining and start working the room.
I have to go find Graydon and tell him he has competition for my protÃ©gÃ©'s exposÃ©.
you two are adorable.
the Tisches have some new competition for the cutest charitable couple.
Nah, this one's all Serena.
we'd love you to introduce her as our newest board member.
then Serena can present the check to the park.
sounds great.
Hey, I wanted to ask you, are you still seeing...
if you'll excuse me...
excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to speak with Nate. Thanks.
what are you doing? That was the head of media for Johnson & Johnson.
I thought you broke up with Sage.
Yeah, I did, which is more than you can say about Steven.
how can you make out with a guy knowing he cheated on you?
okay. I let him kiss me on the cheek, but I'm not gonna break up with him or cause a scene until after this party's over, which became a lot more complicated when Sage arrived.
what don't girls understand about "it was fun. I'm done"?
please just get rid of her.
please tell me there's a carriage somewhere trotting away with Poppy's posse.
they're on their way to the duck pond for their photo shoot.
even though it's not really there.
models are so dumb.
you should've seen them crowded in that carriage like four scrawny sardines.
who needs Serena van der Woodsen when you are friends with Andre the handsome the cab driver?
wait. Four?
women's Wear Daily" needed to photograph six dresses.
that means two are still on the loose.
it only takes one photograph to eclipse my line forever.
I will go distract Nelly Yuki.
you search and destroy anyone with a dandelion motif.
Hurry! Back to the party!
Blair, are you okay?
well, not yet. I still have two dresses I need to round up.
I didn't know that you were coming to Serena's party.
I wasn't intending to, but then I heard from you.
from me?
well, you must've telepathically sensed my distress for my dresses.
no, this was a text.
wait. If you didn't send it, I think I know who did. I have to go.
hurry. The sooner you go, the sooner you can come back.
in the grander sense.
you just gonna ignore me?
look, I told you I have nothing to say to you except good-bye.
I swear I didn't lie.
I just omitted certain details.
and only because I liked you and I knew it wouldn't change anything between us.
then I guess you're more liberal than I am because it definitely changes things for me.
but it doesn't have to.
you could pretend you don't know.
I don't think I can do that.
you could at least try.
I had higher hopes for you, Humphrey.
sorry. What?
how can the smartest boy at St. Jude's still want everything he can't have?
no, I... I don't want her. I was just, uh...
I was just observing.
you know, that's what writers do.
I didn't mean Blair.
I mean in. Your whole Gatsby-ish obsession.
fitzgerald seemed to make a good career out of it.
if you wanna die a miserable drunk trying to impress people who don't know you exist.
there is that fatal flaw.
I got over mine when I went to Yale and met a bunch of other smart losers.
nelly, you're not a loser.
Yes, I am, and so are you. They'll never let us in.
the sooner you accept it, the sooner you can stop trying and start competing.
that's kind of tough when they already have everything.
we have the truth. That's how the losers win.
we stop playing by their rules and make our own.
nelly, don't you look ethereal in this garden of earthly delights.
that's my cue. It was nice talking to you, Nelly.
Dan, there you are. Graydon wants to make us an offer. We're going to Cipriani's to discuss.
this better be good.
I just want to apologize. We got off on the wrong foot this morning.
I wanna hear every detail of your life since constance.
I'm afraid you missed her.
I'd say you could call, but she's probably enjoying a fine Merlot at 30, 000 feet above the ground by now.
no.
she wouldn't leave without her... money.
it's sweet, really, that you also use your mother's birthday as your combination.
you make it all so easy.
drink?
Blair, what are you doing here?
well, I would've R. S. V. P. 'd... if I got my invitation.
or the call to tell me that you'd returned to the city.
kind of reminds me of the time that you came back from boarding school without a word.
I'm not trying to hurt you. I'm just trying to move on, and so should you.
well, as the hostess of such an elegant event, you wouldn't want to cause a scene. Would you?
nothing is more pressing to me than making sure this evening goes perfectly, which I'm sure you have some sort of scheme to destroy.
so please leave before I have security escort you out.
if you weren't invited, Blair, then why are you here?
Blair! Blair! Okay! I got the last one, and I left the model standing in nothing but her La Perlas.
or maybe they were Kiki. I don't... I'm not sure.
is... that one of your Waldorf Designs?
no, it's one of mine, and all the models who are supposed to be wearing them are missing.
what's going on, Blair?
sage? What is this?
why do you care? I didn't come here with you.
well, you're leaving with me now.
I don't think so. - I didn't ask.
take your hands off her. She said "no."
stay out of this. - No, I won't.
you're the one who's supposed to be in a relationship with Serena.
wait. This is your girlfriend?
well, this is my boyfriend.
Steven, what are you doing? !
you know how important tonight is to me, and now you're humiliating me to defend that slut?
that "slut" happens to be my 17-year-old daughter.
spotted... Nate Archibald with a minor problem that just became a major incident.
why didn't you tell me you have a daughter?
obviously because she's the same age as you are.
now Serena is an adult, and she's not missing her curfew and she's not in high school.
Yeah, and I'm not gonna let this drag me back into it.
I have a check to present.
say good night. I'll be back to take you home.
you're in high school? - Isn't that why you broke up with me?
I broke up with you because I thought you were sleeping with your father...
before I knew he was your father.
that's disgusting. - Yeah!
I'm not sleeping with anyone but you.
and it's legal. I checked.
so can we please just go back to your place and do that?
No! You're 17, and I'm pretty sure you're grounded.
I really did audit Professor Peiser's class this summer.
and we're closer in age than my dad and Serena.
or you and Diana Payne.
Yeah. I got an "A" on my paper about "The Spectator."
Serena, I know you're upset.
we spent months together, and you never mentioned you had a child, never mind one who's old enough to share my clothes.
come on. It took you all summer to tell me your real name.
look, we both needed time before we were ready to share everything.
even Shakespeare said, "what's in a name?"
unlike a daughter, who's a huge piece of your life.
Yeah, and when women find out about her, they either bolt or pressure me to meet her.
and honestly, I...
I've never been ready to introduce her to anyone... until you.
you know, I always imagined your first meeting as more of a breakfast or coffee-type thing.
Really? It wasn't punching out her boyfriend?
and the more serious we get, the more we're gonna have to trust each other.
do you think you can do that?
I really wanna try.
business records, blueprints.
you need to stop this childish nonsense.
you're the one who faked a text from Blair. Classic high school move.
how about we call a truce?
it would make Lily happy.
she's very upset that you're trying to destroy our marriage.
I don't care about your marriage, and neither do you.
of course I do.
why else would I have paid Amira all that money to leave town?
to protect whatever secret really forced you to fake your death, something that's obviously not in these files.
I already told you.
I did it to keep you and Lily safe.
and I wanted to believe it.
I wanted to believe you cared about me, that I had finally earned my father's love.
then let me give you some bass properties, and we'll call ourselves a family again.
Oh, no, no, no.
it's too late for that.
you took everything from me, again and again.
now I'm going to find your secret and I'm going to take everything from you.
maybe it's not too late to find Blair and help her with those errands.
why are you torturing me?
Blair knew your dresses would look better than hers in print.
no. I knew that the two of you were working together to destroy me in "W. W. D."
we met for the first time today, Blair, when I interviewed her.
I don't believe you.
and you and your fake African satellite-selling brain did not find my fabric on its own.
plus... I have done terrible things to the two of you in the past, so you must've wanted revenge.
I did, but I didn't scheme to get it.
all I did was set up the article and let you do what you always do...
implode.
one of the things I learned after being run out of Manhattan by a gang of over-privileged teenagers was to just let my anger go.
fashion design is my art therapy.
so... we really just liked the same fabric?
I better go write my story. I don't want to forget any details.
no, no, no! You can't write about this!
wait! Maybe she's right.
if you write that article, it'll bring her so much more attention.
maybe you should just write it about me.
I could use the extra space for more pictures of your collection.
Yes.
where are you going?
I can't start again from nothing! Nelly!
you can be my head Minion.
Blair Waldorf, I've been asked to escort you from the party.
think fast, B. Pencil skirts or peplum?
the only look you have now is egg on your face.
looks good, no?
skilled craftspeople at work. I've never seen such a beautiful sight.
where did they come from?
uh, some from Paris, some from Garment District, a few "Project Runway" rejects.
I know how to enlist employees. I learned from the best.
she's clapping for you!
thank you, Dorota.
now as the new head of Waldorf Designs,
I only have one chance to make my debut.
at fashion show for buyers next week.
as much as I love the line we were developing, it is no longer viable.
so... we simply have to do better.
miss Blair, I know I know nothing of fashion, but...
no one can do a whole line in ten days.
I do realize that this is a lot to ask, but...
we have no choice.
as my mother's first facialist Elizabeth Arden said, "I only want people around me who can do the impossible."
so... we have no time to waste.
I want a picture of every piece my mother has ever designed.
and we need a new inspiration fabric.
so... who wants to come with me to Mood?
great! Let's go then.
vite. Vite.
heard you got a great offer from "Vanity Fair."
I did. I said no.
did Georgina kick you off her couch or what?
no, I left on my own after waking up with her staring at me again.
please tell me that means you're giving your serial to "The Spectator."
I know you need this to succeed as much as I do, but it's only gonna do that if you print it word for word.
done.
you might wanna check it out before you decide.
you, uh, sure you wanna publish this?
I am. Every word of it is true.
but there are details in here the world doesn't need to know.
these are people you care about.
nothing good came from my protecting them.
once I realized I live in a world where Chuck bass gets the girl, everything seemed very clear.
I'm not playing by anyone else's rules anymore.
I'm making my own.
if you don't want this, I... I can self-publish it.
no, no, no, I want it. I'm just saying... I've only read one page, and I'm guessing you might lose some friends and family.
my "friends" chased my sister out of town and chose a guy who traded her for a hotel over me.
and my "family..." yeah, is sleeping with a con artist.
you know, I'm... I'm not... I'm not losing anything here.
I'm taking what's mine.
Serena's gala from last night?
Yes. It looks beautiful in the paper.
I heard there was an unfortunate incident with Steven, but the board said that Serena could keep her seat because she raised a record amount of money.
sorry I had to step out and didn't get home in time for us to make it.
Bart, it's lovely.
it is the least I can do to make up for all the unfortunate drama with Amira and Charles.
I know how important family is to you, Lily, but I think you need to accept that my son may no longer want to be part of ours.
well, I'm not ready to give up hope yet.
no one said being a parent would be easy.
some children will do everything in their power to destroy you.
others will wilt under the weight of your crushing expectations.
she know you can do this, Miss Blair.
I hope she's right.
my entire future, here and with Chuck, depends on it.
you're uncharacteristically quiet this morning, Sage.
what do you want me to say?
thank you for the humiliating experience of being walked to school by my dad and his trophy girlfriend?
I may not be as humiliating as you think.
I went to Constance, too, you know.
just remember your end of the deal.
I go to school, and you let me date Nate.
Oh, you should thank Serena for that.
she's the one that told me he's a decent guy.
Yeah, he was going to St. Jude's while I was at Constance, but you probably already know that from "Gossip Girl."
no one in high school reads "Gossip Girl" anymore. It's for old people.
now can I go, or do you want to hold my hand all the way to homeroom?
go. I love you.
and some will become parents themselves.
what can I say except, uh, welcome to adulthood?
you know I disapprove of teenage pregnancy.
"gossip Girl" says your dad is dating Serena van der Woodsen.
is it true?
not for long.
but a teenage stepdaughter? That's my kind of fun.
gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
"gossip girl" says your dad is dating Serena van der Woodsen. Is it true?
not for long.
this isn't fashion-forward or provocative.
it's exploitation, and it's embarrassing.
Nelly Yuki trashed me in "Women's Wear Daily."
can Blair Waldorf step into her mother's shoes, or is her Achilles' heel of the stripper variety?
it's Jean Pierre. Your mother knows you don't have orders from any buyers.
did this really happen - You and Derena?
every dirty detail.
did you write about that night that we were together at the campbell apartment?
relax. I didn't publish any of that.
last year, when you had no one, I was there for you.
I kinda need you to do the same for me right now.
make yourself at home.
when it comes to Ivy, you're way out of line.
she's a known con artist. She swindled lily and her entire family.
you need to stop sticking your nose in where it doesn't belong.
he didn't fake his death for lily or me.
he did it so he could avoid federal prison.
new day, new debs...
all dressed up to enter high society.
but one fashion faux pass, and the dressing down will last a lifetime.
why are you still chewing? Tell me what you think.
I think, um, it's old school, not in the good way.
in the-in the literal way, like what old ladies used to wear to school.
well, it's traditional, as am I.
I need to remind the world that I am not the hypersexual heathen Nelly Yuki labeled me.
there's traditional, and there's missionary, which does not work for the dress... Or you, as I recall.
being polite does not make me a prude.
so why fight your raunchy reputation?
shock value is what got my "insider" out serial attention.
well, my audience was titillated when Sage stripped down to her skivvies.
go. Get out of here with your high neckline and low hemline.
go!
I have a new vision, and I need a new muse.
and I suggest you replace your muse.
don't let her touch anything.
do you know how many hours I've spent searching for you?
I hate it when you play hard-to-get.
are the pancakes okay? You can tell me if you don't like my cooking.
no, your - Your cooking's great. I just forgot they were there.
uh, like me? You've barely said a word to me all week.
sorry.
I love them - You and the pancakes.
I'm getting my cotillion dress refitted.
I lost weight without even trying.
Oh, you're - You're coming out tonight?
no one calls it that anymore.
well, it's still exciting.
let me know if you need help with your presentation speech or-or any of the dance steps.
my cotillion ended up being one of the best nights of my life, and I'm sure yours will be, too.
all this gushing - It seems like someone's angling for an invitation.
no, I don't expect to be invited.
cotillion is for a girl and her family.
it is.
uh, but no. Not just family. I mean...
not family in the strictest legal sense.
I - I meant to invite you. It must have just slipped my mind.
so much for being the only teenager on my father's arm tonight.
I'm sorry. I'd love for you to be there tonight if it's not too late.
it's never too late for cotillion.
good, then I'll see you there. - Okay.
staying in this room is transforming you into its previous occupant
a diva who ignores my calls and has no work ethic.
come on. You know that second part is not true.
what do you want?
I've come to wrestle the Blair chapter from your hot little hands.
I haven't finished it yet.
you're lying.
you're here in some desperate attempt to regain Blair's love, but you know when she reads what you wrote about her, she's gonna hate you forever.
listen, I can't hold the magazine off any longer. Hand it over.
what language do I need to say it in for you to understand?
it's not done.
I speak five, and in every one, that sentence translates to "bullcrap."
you have until noon to turn it in.
do you know where Miss Blair went?
uh, she forgot to put on lucky charm this morning when she get out of shower.
she think conditioner dulls diamond.
that lucky charm looks a lot like an engagement ring.
no, uh... Is engagement ring on necklace?
at least until Mr. Chuck defeats bad dad.
miss Blair never leave home without it.
I need to prepare for mad mood.
uh, this is Dan Humphrey.
Yeah. Yeah, you can send a messenger to pick up my next chapter.
no, it's not about Blair Waldorf. The one I'm sending is about Chuck Bass.
well, Nate won't publish any more stories about Lily in "The Spectator."
well, I'd give them to Gossip Girl if I had them, but Rufus burned my stash of secrets.
but don't worry. I'll find something. We'll leave her with no one.
so why do we even pay the instructors?
I'll call you later.
what's wrong?
I need to meet the contractor at the gallery.
he called and said a pipe burst and now the floors are ruined.
well, hopefully he's exaggerating.
contractors are always looking for ways to make more money.
well, I don't have any more. It's all in the gallery.
and I can't open without floors. You wanna come?
well, I would, but I have an appointment uptown.
okay.
Hey, shouldn't you be with the FBI, having Bart arrested for illegal oil trading?
they need evidence first.
the Sheikh was the only guy who had any, and he's loyal to his dad.
Bart's been too careful to leave any trace of the transactions on the books.
well, I mean, it's pretty easy to fake numbers.
you speaking from personal experience?
I'm referring to your father.
right. Well, I mean, he got caught, but a lot of people do a little creative accounting to get past a rough patch and never do.
I'm sure every hedge fund manager behind bars is telling himself the same thing.
all I'm saying is that Bart had to keep track of his finances somewhere.
if it wasn't in his business accounts, it was in his personal ones.
you're right.
and hopefully, with Lily's help, we'll be able to get them.
did you instigate a formal dress code at "The Spectator"?
I gotta drop it off at the cleaners before I take Sage to cotillion tonight.
right. Well, I hope your third time coming out is finally a charm.
Serena. - Hey, Chuck.
Bye, Chuck.
Oh, no, just go ahead and help yourself.
don't even mention what you're doing here or, you know...
I need a male's perspective on steven.
he's barely spoken to me all week, and then I don't even think he was gonna tell me about cotillion until sage accidentally mentioned it. I...
has she said anything?
well, her dad doesn't normally come up in most of our conversations.
could the weirdness be that Steven hooked up with your mom in a dungeon when you were in grad school?
no. Once he actually remembered that that happened, it wasn't weird at all.
he got over it really quickly. The awkwardness started after.
and I don't-I don't know how I'm supposed to fix the problem if I don't even know what the problem is.
see, this is where my female advice skills fall short.
most of my exes would just steal my phone or go through all my e-mails.
that was a joke. - I know.
Lily. There you are.
Charles, what are you doing here?
Bart left specific instructions with Vanya not to let me into the apartment, but he did let slip that you were shopping on Madison.
well, I should get home.
Lily, please, I need your help.
last time I tried to help you, you manipulated me against your father.
Bart asked me not to speak with you until you stop attacking our relationship.
you could get me the proof.
don't you wanna know the real reason he faked his death?
look, I'm sorry, Charles.
I hope you make peace with your father soon so we can be a family again.
maybe I can help instead.
did someone order a wedding cake?
if you're talking about my dress, Tom used vintage lace from Paris.
Oh, vintage as in "old" and "used."
well, lucky for you, I have the hottest new line to save your sartorial debut.
why would you want me anywhere near your clothes after I left them on the runway at your fashion show?
well, like it or not, your stunt branded me a provocateur, so I'm embracing it.
the words I read were "distasteful" and "majorly sluttish."
semantics.
now I know you love to make a statement, so drop the prom poof and let's go.
no, thanks. I make a statement in whatever I wear, and tonight, it won't be waldorf.
what are you doing?
um, I just needed to write some e-mails, so I was gonna borrow your dad's computer, but then I decided that I should use mine from home.
must be some pretty thrilling correspondence.
no. No, I am just so excited for you and your cotillion tonight.
I'll see you there.
they say a diamond is forever, or maybe never.
it just depends on who finds it first.
why would I want the help of a con artist and a probable sociopath?
I'm neither of those things, and even if I were, we have a mutual interest in this case.
what are your interests specifically?
to get Lily to leave me alone.
may I suggest you stop following her around in cabs?
I was trying to find dirt.
I figured, you know, if I caused trouble in her relationship, she'd stay out of mine.
well, while I can't deny my desire for marital discord, I won't hurt Lily.
you don't have to.
all you have to do to get your daddy's panties in a bunch is talk to her.
and as you just witnessed, she doesn't want to talk to me.
well, bart doesn't know that.
so what, make it seem like we've been communicating?
plant some evidence at the apartment?
it might work, except Bart has banned me from the building.
I wasn't banned.
and I... Saved a key card.
please tell me this is an inappropriate gift for my debut and not an engagement ring for Serena.
a gift? No, it is not.
dad, stop talking like Yoda.
it's an engagement ring.
God, it's a relief to talk about it.
I've been so nervous, I forgot to invite Serena to cotillion.
Yeah, well, maybe you were nervous because she's way too young, and it's way too soon.
I get it feels fast, but we spent all summer together, and I haven't loved anyone this much since your mother.
we all know how well that turned out.
I'm scared, too, but I want Serena to know that I'm in this for the long haul and I'm not cool with her moving in here with you until we are engaged.
and now that you know, I'm just gonna get Lily's permission and propose to Serena tonight.
screw Lily. I'm not giving my permission.
I'm not asking.
hush, Jessica. Social ascension is a painful process.
well I mean, I know I look young, but do you really think I pass for 16?
no. I'll have Dorota find a dermatologist with some juvederm, stat.
Hey, I was in the neighborhood. I thought you might, uh, enjoy some coffee.
maybe I'd be more believable if Dan was my date.
no real deb would ever be caught dead with an escort from an outer borough.
Dominick Dunne was from Hartford, and he was considered high society.
your Chuck chapter is my favorite. - Thank you.
what, you put out a Chuck chapter?
after I gave you your first decent place to live?
go. Pack your things.
don't you want to read it before you kick me out?
I read Nate's chapter, and you were supposed to be his friend.
you hate Chuck and everything to do with me in relation to Chuck.
that's not true.
Yeah, don't worry, Blair. You're not even in it.
what? That's impossible.
there is no Chuck Bass chapter without Blair Waldorf.
there is, while he focuses on his battle with his father, which is what the chapter's about.
Dan made him seem like a superhero single-mindedly fighting evil.
ask Chuck if he's upset about it when he picks you up for cotillion.
Chuck's not going to cotillion.
Oh, that's right. That's right. I'm sorry.
I forgot you two can't be together until he achieves his goal.
and I achieve mine, which you are distracting me from.
Bye, Jessica. - Okay, bye.
thanks for coming over, darling.
I thought you still might be upset about my brief dalliance with Steven.
Oh, well, I definitely wish it never happened, but I think if he can forget about it, then we should all try, too.
especially since, um, I think he might propose to me soon.
Oh, I had a feeling.
you know, he called me earlier and said he wanted to meet before cotillion.
he said he had something important to ask me.
Oh, my gosh! He really is doing it.
Are-are you sure this is what you want?
I mean, I never really thought about it, but once I saw that ring, I - I literally got butterflies.
well, diamonds seem to have that effect, but...
you're just - You're still so young and...
I know, but steven's not.
he-he's an adult, and he treats me like one.
and, you know, this is the first honest, healthy relationship I've ever had.
it just doesn't seem that long ago that you were in love with Dan.
and now that Rufus and I aren't together, well,
I thought you two might be.
Yeah, well, I-I thought that for a little while, too.
but, you know, then Dan and I had that huge falling out, and I met Steven...
mom, you're gonna say "yes," right?
Oh, lord knows it doesn't matter what I say.
you're gonna do exactly what you wanna do.
Oh, thank you.
I should probably go get a manicure so that my hands look perfect.
Absolutely. - I'll see you at cotillion.
pull it tighter.
we need the illusion of a youthful jawline.
good luck with the old chick.
in some countries, old people are considered beautiful.
mm, not this one.
shouldn't you be at the Waldorf astoria, donning that doily dress?
I just found out my father's proposing to Serena tonight.
that is so exciting! We'll all get to be there to witness it.
Yes, and be upstaged.
I thought you'd want to stop that from happening, in exchange for me wearing your dress, of course.
well, you consider yourself a master manipulator.
why not squash the proposal yourself?
come on, Blair. We all know from "Gossip Girl"
there's no one better at taking down Serena than you.
that is true, but I would need a 2-tiered plan, some kind of protection.
your generation can't be trusted with scheming on good faith.
I promise I'll behave.
just please stop her from marrying my dad.
okay. Fine.
I will delay the proposal for tonight, and if you keep your promise and I get my buyers, then we can discuss ending their engagement plans for good.
Oh, do we get to climb fire escapes and wear stockings on our heads for that part?
Yes, Jessica. Go get outfitted and-and wait for my signal.
okay, great. Okay.
she's not actually gonna be wearing...
no. No. She was just annoying me.
bring in the dress! It needs to be refitted.
I sprayed your cologne, and I put a copy of Bart's will you gave me on Lily's desk.
he'll be furious with her if he thinks we're conspiring to reclaim his empire.
now fill a glass with Scotch.
now drink it. I wouldn't leave a drop.
Hello?
who the hell are you?
Blair, what a nice surprise.
Hello, Lily. I wish I could say the same about Serena's impending proposal.
has she discussed it with you?
Oh, she has. She seems thrilled.
need I say more?
Serena's enthusiasm is like the bat signal for bad ideas.
it's sudden, I know, but she does seem happy.
but doesn't she always when she's with a new guy?
Dan, Nate, Colin, Ben.
Oh, she is a romantic, bless her tender heart.
but, Lily, you and I are realists.
we need to look after her because she isn't capable of looking after herself.
thank you, Blair. I appreciate your input.
Bye.
Lily. Thanks for coming to meet me.
I know it's old-fashioned, but with our... history and Serena's father not being a constant...
you want my permission to marry my daughter.
mission accomplished.
how do you know you convinced her?
all I have to do is subtly suggest Serena needs saving, and Lily jumps into protective mother mode, ready to do anything to shield her precious daughter from another relationship gone wrong.
she even had one guy sent to prison.
well, my dad better not end up in lock up, but I hope you're right about the rest.
I am, and just in case, we have your part of the plan as backup.
everything's in motion.
you can either tell me who you are or you can tell the police.
no, please, no police.
my mother Larissa just sent me over to clean something for Mrs. Lily.
she's sick, but Mrs. Lily called and said it was an emergency.
and, uh, that's what needed cleaning?
Mrs. Lily said no one else was supposed to see.
Mrs. Lily doesn't pay your mother's salary.
I do.
that'll be all.
you look beautiful.
you're quite the dapper Dan yourself.
unfortunately, Jessica's off somewhere with pantyhose on her head, so she no longer requires an escort.
I'm-I'm not gonna ask, but I'm not dressed for Jessica.
I know Chuck's busy, and no one should go too cotillion alone.
well, I suppose I could overlook your upbringing now that you're a regular feature in "Vanity Fair."
Spotted-one man leaving Harry Winston empty-handed.
steven Spence walked in with a ring and left without one.
I wonder what-or who- he's returning.
Where's the Blair chapter?
why do you care?
Chuck just posted, and the next chapter's not due for a week.
maybe to "Vanity Fair," but I want it now.
I know you, Humphrey.
I'm not gonna let you turn our scathing expose into a sentimental sonnet because of your delusional feelings for blair.
why are you so sure that I'm delusional and not determined?
she did date me.
briefly, after she lost her prince and her mind.
and now she wears that adorable engagement ring from Chuck around her neck.
not on her finger.
that shoulder, arm, and torso space is my window to win her back.
now if you'll excuse me. - Not so fast.
either lose the romance notions, or I'll lose them for you.
where did you get that?
Serena's phone.
looks like you two share a nostalgia for long-lost loves.
excuse me. Sorry.
I bet she still uses it to get off. I know I do.
you can't show that to Blair.
unless you want Blair to hate you forever for screwing her best friend while you two were still together, you'll get me those pages.
I'm doing this for your own good.
there's no viagra to save a career that's gone soft.
okay, just give me until midnight.
only because I love "cinderfella.
I'm so sorry! Sorry.
why did I ask a peasant's advice on how to dress royalty?
your shock and amaze plan had better work.
I'm counting on it.
you came.
Blair, you look devastating, as always.
and, Humphrey, I see you immortalized me once again in print.
should I be concerned about your level of obsession?
not at all. I find your battle with your father inspiring.
it's the stuff myths are made of, like Zeus and Cronus.
it never ends.
until Zeus wins and comes to be with Hera.
actually, Zeus tricked Hera into being with him...
after he raped her.
enough about the gods. Let's drink.
I'm sorry, Blair. I can't. I'm here to speak with Lily.
I'm betting Bart will come, too, to confront her.
I'm hoping after that she'll join my battle against him.
have you seen her?
no, but go find her and imprison Cronus. The sooner the better.
go find us a prime viewing spot. I need to speak with Sage.
thank you.
Serena! You look lovely.
did you deny Steven permission to propose to me?
well, I wouldn't exactly phrase it that way.
I did express concern that you might not be ready for marriage.
Oh, how would you know? Were you ready all six times you did it?
look, I'm sorry that you're upset, Serena, but I'm not the only one that had misgivings.
I mean, Blair called and shared hers as well.
Blair has no right to share anything. We're not even friends anymore.
you knew how much I wanted this.
I knew you wanted someone, but let's face it, Serena.
you don't have boyfriends. You have life rafts.
that you keep taking from me and-and leaving me to drown.
first you got together with Rufus so that I could never be with Dan, and now you're jealous that some man that doesn't remember sleeping with you is in love with me.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.
girls, I need your personal statements.
bunny Raburn, I hope you included your ballet photos.
ask my mom. She made it.
thank you, Sage. Congratulations on your academic accolades.
which clearly have nothing to do with intelligence.
why is Serena here? I told you to keep her away.
I did what you said.
I used my dad's phone to uninvite her, and I had him take the ring my mom sent me to get resized, and I had my minions send a picture to "Gossip Girl."
your plan just sucked.
my plan does not suck. We'll just have to come up with a new one.
I already have.
don't worry. I'll be shocking in your dress, and Serena will never be my evil stepmom.
now I have to find my date.
Bart. What a nice surprise. I wasn't expecting you.
just like you weren't expecting me to find out about your secret meeting with Chuck?
I knew you'd be upset. You know, he tracked me down while I was shopping.
so you invited him back to our apartment to go through my will?
I have no idea what you're referring to.
Charles was not in our apartment.
I told him I wasn't comfortable speaking with him until he made things right.
stop lying to me, Lily.
I caught Larissa's daughter cleaning up after you.
Bart, Larissa's daughter is 4.
then who was the 20-something blonde I caught with Chuck's Scotch glass?
let me guess. 5'4," slim, could pass as Serena's cousin?
Ivy. She's the same one that leaked those nasty rumors about me last week.
Charles, how could you, after everything I've done to try to make peace?
I don't want peace.
I want you to help me make him pay for what he did.
put a silver spoon in your mouth?
or raise you as a single parent?
which one do you want to punish me for first, son?
Lily, you have to trust me. You are aiding and abetting a criminal.
Charles, that's enough.
do you want to end up like Ruth Madoff, losing your son to defend your husband?
I don't want to lose anyone, Charles, but you're leaving me no choice.
I'm going to get my coat.
what can I say? Marriage has its privileges.
I'd like to welcome you all to the dispensary cotillion and debutante ball.
our first debutante is Jillian Fremont.
Jillian is the daughter of Winston and...
sorry.
Serena! There you are.
whatever it is, Blair, I don't have time.
I have to try to stop you and my mom from destroying my proposal.
not destroy, just delay long enough for Sage to wear my dress.
she really doesn't want you as a stepmom, and I only have a month to win back buyers after you walked out of my fashion show.
Oh, so you get to ruin my future to sell dresses?
Yeah, that's justified.
what difference does it make if your engagement comes a few days late, after I have Waldorf Designs back on track?
don't you get it? It's not coming.
whatever you did made Steven return the ring.
you mean that picture on "gossip girl."
sage's mom sent her a ring as a gift.
he was at Harry Winston getting it resized.
this was all part of a very well-thought out plan.
it was? - Yes.
he still has the ring because he still wants to marry you.
do you really think so? - Of course.
have you ever met yourself?
any man who loves Serena van der Woodsen would never let Lily or anyone else tell him not to be with her.
you know, when I saw that ring, you were the only person I wanted to talk to about it.
well, I would never try to take away your happiness.
well, at least not permanently.
if you love him and it's meant to be, then I want it, too.
unfortunately, kids today are not like we were.
they're unpredictable and alliance-free. There is no line they won't cross.
you know, I thought Sage was really starting to like me.
well, you were wrong, and now she's gone rogue.
she's come up with a plan of her own that I am scared is more dastardly than even I can imagine.
you have to warn Steven.
I will, right after I tell him I love him and that I want to marry him.
thank you, B.
now go. I wanna be a bridesmaid.
our next debutante is Bunny Raburn.
bunny is the daughter of Jim and Fran Raburn.
ticktock. - She's escorted by Tom Grand.
bunny began to dance as a toddler...
Hey. How you feeling?
like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Oh, there you are. I'm glad you made it.
so I-I take it you didn't uninvite me either?
of course not. What are you talking about?
well, I know about the engagement ring, and I don't care about my mom's permission.
neither do I.
our next debutante is Sage Spence.
you ready for this? - I can hardly wait.
sage is the daughter of Paulette and Steven Spence.
she's escorted by Nathaniel Archibald.
I always knew you could do dirty.
provocative. We do make a good team.
her love of horseback riding started on the central park carousel...
what are you doing? Help me!
ed, black it out!
can we please turn off the screen?
No! No! Stop that!
that's weird. Your camera's on.
uh, no, no, it's not.
whoa, I think it was recording us, actually.
Oh, gosh. Maybe I-I...
Blair, I can explain this. - Here, let me erase it.
you manipulated me into thinking that it was over so I would cheat on her.
I said I'd never mention S. Again,
why don't we start the dancing early, huh?
dancing. Dancing would be good.
sage did this. She told Blair she had a plan.
what, the same Blair who put her in a fashion show half-naked?
no, Sage did that, too. You cannot let her sabotage our relationship.
excuse me if I don't take parenting advice from a woman who recorded herself having sex with her ex to get revenge on her best friend.
I know that that was wrong. I was in a really bad place, which is why I left town in the first place
to get a fresh start, which I had with you.
this doesn't change us. - It changes everything.
so the whole time you refused to speak to me for choosing Chuck, you were cheating on me with Serena.
it was only once. And you-you heard the tape.
she manipulated me into it.
in order to claim date rape, you have to say "no."
look, she told me you chose Chuck, which turns out wasn't even a lie.
you just didn't have the decency to tell me yourself.
I intended to, but I respected you enough not to sleep with him until I did.
I thought Chuck sleeping with Jenny was the most despicable thing someone could do to me.
but this is worse, because you pretended to be better.
at least I ended up with the right person.
you ended up with no one.
Chuck will never be finished fighting with his father, and that ring around your neck is never gonna be on your finger.
I would rather be with no one than with you.
what the hell happened to waiting until midnight?
I was going to. That little bitch Sage stole my phone.
W-what did I-What did I ever do to her?
well, from what I've heard over debs hurling in the bathroom, she wanted to stop her daddy from marrying Serena.
the surprise ending for your serial was just collateral damage.
well, you still got what you wanted.
Blair hates me forever.
I'm gonna go get the next chapter.
bring it to me here.
I forgot how much I love being 16.
tell me this isn't your best cotillion ever.
Oh, are you kidding me? This is worse than when I punched Carter Baizen.
excuse me, mini me. My phone?
is this yours?
skip the innocent act. I admire your way with an antic.
if you're ever in the need of employment, call me.
wait. You broadcast the sex tape?
would you want your father to marry Serena?
she's my friend. You humiliated her.
I didn't force her to do it for the camera.
I simply reported it, like you did with my dad and Lily on "The Spectator."
that's a newspaper, not a society gala.
and I didn't do it to hurt them.
you know what? You may be legal, but this is way too high school for me.
Nate! Nate, where are you going? We were in the middle of a dance!
Ah, that's great. As long as they're done for the opening.
Thanks.
that sounded positive. Are the floors okay?
they were destroyed, but Bex told an anonymous collector about the Cole James piece, which means now we have the money to replace them.
well, I knew everything would work out.
I'm gonna go clean up so we can celebrate.
and say "thanks" to Bex for me, too.
Bex, I know you're not allowed to tell me who bought the piece, uh, but, uh, I'd like to send them an invitation and, uh, a thank-you note.
a P.O.Box would be great.
wait. Are you s - Are you sure it's 76648?
Yep, that's all I needed. Thanks.
I guess we learned what appalling thing Sage had planned.
you're the one who's appalling, and a lot of other words that I should not utter at a society gala.
Blair, I-I know that that video was horrible, but you had already chosen Chuck.
did you know that when you took Dan to the Campbell apartment and set up a camera to seduce him for the whole world to see?
no, it wasn't like that. A waitress had spilled on us, and-and-and so we went to clean up.
I don't believe you.
you took Nate's virginity on that bar, when I loved him.
you just needed to prove that you could still take anyone I want.
the only one you want is Chuck.
I am so sorry, Blair. I made a mistake, but so did you when you teamed up with Sage to try to ruin my proposal.
no.
I stopped when I knew that you could really get hurt, but you didn't.
you crossed the line and kept going.
only because I thought I loved Dan, and you didn't.
you know, Serena, I kept hoping that this was just like all of our other fights, and that no matter how much we hated each other, we would still always be best friends.
but you were right, what you said before my fashion show.
we haven't been friends for a long time.
I just couldn't see it.
we all came into this world naked and alone.
what are you doing?
you know, going through someone's mail is a federal offense.
as is purchasing artwork with stolen funds.
you wanna explain the bank account with all the zeroes?
I didn't steal it. Lola returned it to me.
that's Carol's portion of Cece's estate.
that makes sense.
what doesn't is why you came to me pretending to have nothing, when you could buy half of Manhattan.
that money alienated me from everyone I cared about.
but I couldn't do nothing while you lost the gallery.
Yeah, but you still should've told me.
I'm sorry, but my being rich doesn't change anything between us.
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
money caused all my problems with Lily.
I'd never lord my fortune over your head the way she did.
I mean, this money just...
means we can be us and fix broken floors and go on great trips and celebrate with fabulous champagne.
I never thought I'd be grateful to Cece Rhodes.
Hey, Steven, it's me. Can we meet somewhere to talk, please?
Serena, I have nothing more to say to you.
so that's it? You're just gonna break up with me over Sage's manipulation?
she was right. We moved too fast, and you are too young.
no, but that's not what you said this summer. You said that we were perfect together.
we were, until we got back to your life in new york.
but I didn't want this life. That's why I ran away.
it's still a part of you, and my loving you isn't enough to shut it out.
and I can't marry someone who always has another sex tape or hidden agenda or surprise scheme up their sleeve.
I'm a father. I can't just think about myself.
I'm sorry, Serena, more than you know.
you take care of yourself.
are you okay?
not really. Are you?
I'm not sure.
you, uh, you wanna grab a burger?
and fries. And a shake.
Yeah. Why not?
okay.
thank you for never sleeping with Serena.
the pleasure was all mine.
her sick show with Dan is all over "Gossip Girl."
well, at least now everyone can see the truth about them.
they can see everything about them.
but I have to say, I didn't expect this from Humphrey.
and though I always wanted you to choose me,
I always feared he was the better man.
no one's better for me than you.
then you won't mind waiting a little longer for us to be together?
your plan to have Lily help you didn't work?
my father has her wrapped around his finger.
I have to find a way to expose him on my own.
you will.
and I will wait as long as it takes.
if that's what you still want - to wait.
they say good things come to those who do.
was that you vibrating?
I should go.
I know it seems like forever, but I know what my father did, and I just have to prove it.
when Charles said I was aiding and abetting, Bart, have you done something that would send you to prison?
I never told you...
to protect you from exactly these kinds of attacks.
after the mortgage meltdown, Bass industries was in trouble.
I knew some people who knew some people, and I made a deal to sell some oil from Sudan.
there was an embargo in place which made it illegal, and then things got complicated.
was anyone hurt?
no.
well, that's all I needed to know.
there's something to be said for having a partner in crime.
did your dad dump the bitch yet?
no. But I wondered if you'd seen Bart do anything unusual in the apartment.
maybe the reason he's so intent on keeping me out is because what I need's inside.
well, he did hold on to this envelope the whole time, but I didn't see who it was from.
sorry.
no. You've been very helpful. Thank you.
sometimes you have no choice but to go it alone.
you know I hate cryptic text messages.
I need to emotionally prepare for a gift or a land mine.
I have both.
well, gift first so I can appreciate it before I'm blown to smithereens.
Jean Pierre call to get pattern for Sage sex dress.
he say he already has calls from buyers.
well, then that means that Waldorf Designs will be in stores before my mother's deadline.
what could possibly explode that?
miss Eleanor called, too.
she saw photos of cotillion.
she said she'll come home to fix decorum disaster.
after all, you're the only one who can answer for your sins.
well, come on, do you think that my mom's right, that Steven was just another in my long line of life rafts?
I don't know. Do you feel like you're drowning without him?
we probably both need to learn how to swim.
Oh, come on. How is that fair?
I get dumped over our sex tape, and you get girls?
what can I say? They like what they saw.
well, they didn't see your plaid boxers, clearly.
Hey, those are my favorites.
I remember, from four years ago.
you want more pie?
Hey, excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.
uh, could we get some more - What do you want, pecan or apple crisp?
both. And banana cream?
thank you.
Hey, thanks for being humiliated with me.
once you've answered for your sins, there's nothing in the way of starting a whole new partnership.
gossip girl here...
your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite.
Daniel Humphrey has just released the latest installment of his serial...
a chapter on our very own Serena.
why would you write this now? You were supposed to be different.
what I want isn't in Brooklyn, dad.
I have a plan. I have this whole time.
you are indebted to me. You're gonna help me defeat Chuck.
meet me at my office first thing tomorrow.
unless, of course, you'd rather a wake-up call from the feds.
he is a ruthless criminal.
there is nothing to stop him from hurting anyone, including you.
I told you, no one got hurt.
you're hurting me right now.
Lily has finally seen the light. She's going to help me take down Bart.
will you go to war with me?
I thought you'd never ask.
step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
you place the orange under your neck, and you pass it to the player right next to you...
but without using your hands.
Mrs. Bass?
who are you?
didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Bass? - Tell me what?
any morning now, he could wake up dead.
leave me alone!
dead, Mrs. Bass, like last week's news.
Dorota, it's time!
wakey, wakey! Let's hope in this nightmare, father doesn't know best.
this is the one.
this hovel? You're flush with cash from your movie deal.
look. Nikki Finke put your picture up next to Harvey's.
you should be looking for a soundproof room and a bidet and a guest bath.
what are you talking about? I don't... I don't need a bidet.
it's for me.
well, now I'll never be able to set foot in the guest bath without first thinking of your Geor-Gina.
but you're not moving in here, so you can check your fantasies at the door.
what happened to Philip?
something happened to Philip?
well... - What?
I am a highly sought after talent manager now.
I cannot be expected to live in a lesser borough.
and Philip loves Brooklyn and he has his little daddy and me classes every Tuesday in Fort Green.
you're delusional.
this is great. I'll take it... solo.
great. Great.
the only thing is that the co-op board of this building is particularly stringent, so if you want in, you'll have to get a good reference.
right.
Lily, I have researched all the names and numbers you gave me from Bart's offshore accounts.
I can't pull up the records without the pass codes.
do you recall any of those?
I'm sorry, Charles. I gave you all the information I have.
okay. Well, thank you. I appreciate your help.
unfortunately, I need something more.
I better go. I'm late for my bamboo oat body smoother.
good luck, darling.
Lily's information is useless without the P. I. N. numbers.
we have no hard evidence Bart illegally traded oil.
well, it's too bad.
tonight's gala would've been the perfect time to strike, with the city's most prominent eyes upon him.
man of the year. What a charade.
that's it. - What's it?
a charade.
Lily's information may not be enough to convict Bart, but it may be enough to bluff a confession out of him.
I can't put Lily in danger, he cannot know she was the one who told me about the accounts.
but what if Lily didn't do it?
are you on some diet I should know about?
you literally just tossed a cookie.
I go to Constance. I know an eating disorder when I see one.
no, it's more like nerves. I have my daily meeting with Bart Bass.
well, if the stress is driving you to manorexia, maybe you should skip it.
Yeah, right.
only reason Bart's not sending me to jail is because I'm being his mole with Chuck.
I mean, I don't know how Claire Danes does it. Spying hurts me head, okay?
well, maybe he'll get sick of these meetings soon enough.
that's doubtful, and the only thing he hates more than Chuck is tardiness, so I'm gonna go.
Hey, Marshall, it's Serena.
uh, let me know if you hear of any sublets or productions that need an extra hand.
I'll be in L. A. tomorrow. Bye.
it is a mess in here. .
Yeah, I'm just purging my closet.
it's just what the doctor ordered, and a little distraction.
which is exactly what we have for you.
is this about Bart? Yeah, my mom called and told me everything.
it sounds like it's gotten pretty scary.
which is why we need to stop him.
but in order to do that, we have to elicit a confession.
and make him believe we have proof for his crimes.
okay, but how can I help?
well, the last person to be seen with that microfilm in her grimy little paw was Ivy Dickens.
but her cell's been disconnected and she hasn't been spotted on "Gossip Girl" for weeks.
she's probably at Cece's Hamptons house.
that's the place she went the last time she disappeared.
why don't we, uh, get her back here?
Hello?
Hey, Ivy. It's Serena.
Yeah, I know. I can afford caller I. D.
you know, I've been doing some thinking, and...
and I realized that my family treated you horribly.
true. But why apologize now?
I don't know. I guess since Dan humiliated me,
I have a new appreciation for friendship.
so why don't we met at the Oak Room around noon?
and, uh, we can chat over lunch.
fine.
and there are some things I wanna talk to you about as well.
great. Bye.
she's in.
Hey, William, I might not be here when you get back.
but you'll be excited to know that your daughter and I are working on smoothing things over.
per your instructions, I swiped Chuck's phone.
well done, grasshopper.
he had breakfast with Blair at Rosemary this morning and has a hotel management meeting later this afternoon.
isn't this getting a little bit dull for you?
my ennui is of no concern to you.
I will not be caught off guard by Chuck's antics while I'm being feted at tonight's event.
Yeah, fine.
well, the only other thing I noticed was that he called Ivy Dickens a few times.
don't try to tell me you all wanna be friends.
we don't. - I called you here under false pretenses.
we need your help with a mission we have against Bart Bass.
are you kidding? I was locked in a room with Bart Bass. He's dangerous.
Yes, he is, and you aggravated him with your topless antics and missing microfilm.
so if you ever wanna safely return to New York, he needs to be taken care of.
well, if I knew how, I would've done it.
we need you to be the goat.
don't tell me you've never studied medieval warfare.
when the Byzantines wanted to lure a dragon from its cave, they tied a goat to a stick.
you wanna tie me up and leave me somewhere?
it's a metaphor.
we're going to use you and the copies you made of the microfilm as bait.
but I didn't make any copies.
as far as Bart's concerned, you did.
it all went according to plan.
that's probably Bart calling you now.
start talking.
I heard you're back in town. Where are you?
the Oak Room.
coincidentally, I'm around the corner, and I have time for a chat.
he's on his way.
the microfilm had the records of Bart's illegal oil trade.
as long as you get him talking, he's bound to say something that links him to his crimes.
and make sure to record everything he says on your phone.
Nathaniel Archibald, you're under arrest for fraud.
wait. What?
poor Nate. Playing the double agent got him into double the trouble.
and now that Bart's wise to this guy, the question is, who will he outsmart next?
thank you.
my lawyers are doing everything in their power to have him released as soon as possible.
well, obviously Bart figured out that Nate was playing him.
and then he started using Nate as his goat.
am I the only one who didn't study Byzantine warfare?
he thinks having Nate arrested will force me to go to him to make a deal.
well, if that's what he wants, don't give in.
I'm not about to let Nate rot in jail.
I have to go to the apartment and see what he proposes.
will you go with him?
Bart's less likely to pull anything if someone else is on the premises.
of course. Chuck?
after you.
well, that's my cue to leave, too. - Not so fast.
you are not going anywhere. We might need you as leverage.
you're coming with me.
so... what can I do for you, Daniel?
well, um... I have... I've found an apartment that I'm interested in buying.
recently, I've had some... trouble lending money to my son's friends.
no. No, I'm not here for a loan.
for the first time ever, in fact, I have plenty of money.
but I need a sponsor to vouch for me for the co-op board, and I know your name carries a lot of weight in New York real estate.
well, unlike my son, it's nice to see someone recognizes my stature in this town.
you couldn't find a better sponsor than New York real estate's man of the year.
that's right. I hear congratulations are in order.
thank you.
you know, I've been assigned a reporter to do a profile on me in conjunction with the event.
maybe you would like the opportunity instead?
profiles are my specialty.
good. Then it's settled.
you write nice things about me, I'll write you a great recommendation.
if you'll excuse me, I have some... family business to attend to.
but I look forward to working with you.
I'm... I'm glad to see you. I've been trying to reach you since Thanksgiving.
Oh, yeah, and I've been ignoring your calls, your e-mails, and your texts.
Serena, please. Just let me explain.
explain what? That you're best friends with Bart Bass?
Congratulations. You've officially joined the dark side.
okay, I'm here. I know that's why you had Nate arrested.
so tell me, what's it gonna take to get you to drop the charges?
it's quite simple, actually.
stop your witch hunt and leave New York for Moscow tonight... alone.
Moscow? As in Russia?
it's lovely place. Real estate market is booming.
lots of opportunities for a young entrepreneur like yourself.
and how long do you expect me to live in exile?
forever.
you can never come back to New York.
that's not a deal. That's a different kind of prison sentence.
I will find another way to get Nate out of jail.
there is no other way. Don't you get it?
I'm very close friends with the police commissioner.
the only person who can get Nate out of jail... is me.
we'll see how powerful you are when you are locked inside with him.
if you want to go to Chuck, go.
you can trust me. You were right.
I need to help you get rid of Bart if I wanna come back to New York to be with the man that I love.
we have a pact, just like you and Chuck.
Rufus? What kind of cockamamie love pact did you make with Rufus?
it's not Rufus, although I'm not at liberty to name names at this time.
Really? 'Cause I'm just dying to know.
Oh, no. The samples just came in and they are a disaster.
I have to go back to the atelier.
don't answer your phone unless it's me, and do not move off that couch.
Dorota will be able to tell if there are fresh footprints on the Aubusson.
I saw your picture all over the news. What happened?
Bart figured out I was playing both sides, and this is his way of retaliating.
how are you doing?
well... better now that you're here.
tmz leaked your mug shot, and you actually look pretty cute.
well, cute is gonna help me now.
I spoke with Chuck's lawyers, and they haven't made any progress in getting me out on bail.
well, I know you don't trust your grandfather or anyone from the Van Der Bilt side of the family, so I called someone who has some experience with this kind of situation.
dad?
why are you stopping?
Hello? ! are you deaf? Will you give me a hand signal?
I... I speak fluent sign.
what the hell are you doing? !
taking you for a little ride.
looking for me? - Where's Blair?
she texted me and said she's here. If you've done something...
Blair is fine, okay? She's upstairs in the atelier, unharmed.
she's fine because I decided she could be fine.
maybe next time I make a different decision.
so perhaps you'd like to... reconsider my earlier offer?
are you threatening Blair with physical harm?
me? No. I wouldn't hurt a fly.
but I'm not God. I can't help it if accidents happen.
this fight is between me and you. Leave everyone else out of it.
if you want your best friend to get out of jail, your stepmother to enjoy her happy marriage, your girlfriend to continue making her pretty little dresses...
then a new life on the other side of the world is your only option.
the Bass jet is waiting on the tarmac.
go to Moscow tonight, then everyone you love will be safe.
I spoke to your lawyers. The judge is refusing to set bail.
this can't be happening.
you're clearly being victimized because of the mistakes I've made in the past.
now don't worry. It'll all get sorted out.
no, it won't, dad.
I did it. I'm guilty.
Nate. You've always done the right thing.
I can't believe you'd do something like this.
although, after the example I set for you, I suppose I only have myself to blame.
this was all me.
I fudged the numbers to try and save "The Spectator ."
so you slipped.
you've always stood by me. It's my turn to stand by you.
we'll go to the lender, explain everything to them, pay them whatever you owe.
they'll drop the charges.
no.
the only person that can drop the charges is Bart Bass, and he won't budge.
Dorota, the samples were pristine.
it was a false alarm... merely Bart Bass fanning the flames.
so make sure that Ivy's ass stays glued to that couch cushion.
Yes, this is Blair Waldorf.
apparently, my town car has been absconded by a ruthless billionaire.
so if you'd please send another... preferably with a different, less devious driver...
no. No, what do you mean? I'm not still in the car. I'm right here.
Why? Where'd it go?
thank you.
you seem engrossed.
Oh, I am.
normally, I don't go for... romance novels, but, uh...
the way you describe Serena...
Where'd you get that?
a package came this afternoon.
thinking it was your profile on me, I opened it.
Yeah, well, uh, I wrote two versions of the Serena chapter, and that's... that's the nice one.
I prefer the nasty one you published.
I'm not sure that was the best decision. - Why not?
when I was staying here with Serena, I...
do you wanna hear this?
I was trying to make her fall in love with me so I could write the ultimate expose bringing down the golden girl.
but while I was busy trying to win her affections,
I realized I was still in love with her.
and wrote this nonsense.
I would've published it, too, but, uh, but on Thanksgiving, I realized that Serena was...
never gonna take me seriously unless I could show her that I wasn't afraid of her, that I didn't think she was better than me.
Bravo. You made the right decision.
Yeah, but she won't speak to me now.
let your father... serve as a cautionary tale, Daniel.
he's sitting over there in Brooklyn alone, while I'm here married to Lily.
Serena respects you now, even if she doesn't know it.
you stay the course, she will come around in time.
that was the idea, but it's, uh, it's taking a little longer than I expected.
well... hopefully, you have a few more days until she moves to Los Angeles.
Los Angeles?
stop! What are you doing?
I couldn't live with myself if anything happened to you.
but I'm fine. - Because I'm leaving.
it's a small price to pay for your safety.
but I don't want to be safe. I wanna be with you.
come on. Let's go together. I'll have Dorota send my things.
Blair, I can't. I have to go alone.
I made a deal. Those were my father's terms.
just have faith in me, this one last time.
but I... I've waited too long. I need to be with you now.
Blair, trust me. Letting me go is the right thing to do.
no. Don't get on the plane.
Bart has already hurt so many people.
I know what my father's capable of, but he would never try to kill his own son.
then... do one thing before you go.
kiss me, Chuck Bass.
I have called you all here because you are the most conniving group of scammers and schemers that I know.
and, Serena, you're my best friend.
thanks for clarifying. I still don't understand why Georgina's here, though.
you can't have an evil cabal without the queen of con.
and frankly, I should've been given more notice.
you lost your royal status when I took your phone at cotillion.
phone stealing? Seriously?
that's the training bra of treachery.
enough!
if I wanted infighting, I would've called my minions.
now I need her here. I need you all here to use your dastardly skills to take down Bart Bass.
Yeah, but last time we did that, Nate ended up in jail.
do you want to go back to being the goat or lend your impersonation prowess to my plan?
Blair, are you sure Chuck would want you involved in his war?
it's not his choice. Now I want you all to get Bart talking.
and record him on your phones.
we'll merge your master manipulations, your wanton disregard for authority, and your brilliance at playing dumb.
Bart Bass may be able to fool the FBI, but he has never had to face off against Blair Waldorf and her bitches.
Bart, hey.
my mom wanted me to tell you she's so sorry she can't be here to celebrate your accomplishments.
well, all... all this does seem rather impressive, doesn't it?
Hey, maybe you can show her the slide show when she returns.
I'm sure she'd love to see your travels.
is everything okay?
I don't remember approving that slide.
well, obviously someone likes it.
obviously, there's a glitch in the system. If you'll excuse me...
have you gotten this evening's program?
you look even more dashing in it than you do in person.
well, at least they followed my instructions regarding this part of the presentation.
tell me the truth, do you trade on your good looks to get all your adoring donors?
how did you get Lady Alexander to give so much, and twice on Sundays...
I bet she really put you through your paces.
did you give this to anyone else?
no.
unless you count everybody here.
whatever it is you're trying to pull, I'm putting a stop to it.
great job on stealing the dead guy's phone.
now just keep calling Bart until he cracks.
I'm gonna start phase two.
Serena, there you are.
Dan. What are you doing here? Oh, wait! I forgot.
you're honoring your new mentor Bart Bass.
if you'll excuse me, I need to be anywhere but here.
just tell me if you are really leaving town.
what do you care? You can just as easily write despicable things about me from afar.
I know you're mad, but that chapter's not the only thing I've written about you.
the... the most flattering things I've written about anyone have been about you, too.
Oh, okay, that was five years ago.
since then, I've been the empty-headed blonde in "Inside,"
and... and the golden girl with daddy issues in "Inside Out."
your writing changed, and so did you.
that's no reason to leave your entire world behind.
my world turned you from a person with integrity into a cruel satirist.
I mean, you're worse than gossip girl. At least she has a conscience.
no matter what it looks like, I'm still on your side, Serena. I always have been.
Yeah, well, excuse me if I don't wait around to be disappointed again.
I'm moving to L. A. Just as soon as I'm done helping Blair with Bart, which... you should be doing, too, but you're on his side.
hire more staff if you have to. I will not be embarrassed at my own party.
excuse me, sir. Would you like a cocktail?
we have a lovely Sudanese vodka.
what the hell are you doing here?
just a waitress trying to serve you a drink, which you look like you could use.
Lily destroyed what was inside of this already.
or did I make copies?
you never know which one of these has what you're looking for.
Bart? There you are.
perhaps you remember my very special guest Iman Hassan?
you did some oil dealings with her father.
it's lovely to see you, Iman.
although I never did any business with your father.
we were simply good friends. - Who shared a love of horses.
Yes, that's right.
how is her dear Lady Alexander living out her days at your horse farm?
grazing away happily, I should think.
I know what you did to my horse.
did you murder my father, too?
I loved your father like a brother.
if you'll excuse us, Iman... we need a moment.
tell security where I am.
I wouldn't want to go mysteriously missing.
I know what you're trying to doing with the envelopes and the phony phone calls.
I've seen "a Christmas Carol."
the classic tale of misdeeds haunting a man who didn't remedy them.
you know, I've always felt that scrooge was unfairly maligned.
he simply expected people to act like adults.
and in other news...
there is no Santa Claus, Ms. Waldorf.
owned and operated by Bass Industries.
the G2 was reported missing off the coast of Maine.
wait. Turn that up. - Sure.
the coast guard is investigating the area where the plane went off the radar after sending a mayday signal.
Oh, no. I hope that wasn't the one Chuck was on.
at present, there was no communication from the plane.
a search and rescue operation is currently underway to identify victims.
good evening. My name is Jason Pomeranc, and I'm the chairman and founder of Thompson Hotels.
I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome you all to New York real estate's man of the year award.
that's my cue.
the exact number of passengers aboard the plane is still uncertain.
we'll bring you more information as it becomes available.
Bart Bass has been a boon to Manhattan's skyline.
to truly introduce him properly, it's my honor to present the number one chronicler of Manhattan's elite...
Mr. Daniel Humphrey.
I would like to introduce an icon of New York real estate and a pillar of our community.
he is the center of the Bass family and he's a personal inspiration to me.
please welcome Charles Bass.
thank you. Thank you.
my father is being honored here as a humanitarian, but the last time I checked, humanitarians value human life...
and he just tried to have his own son killed.
isn't that why you look so surprised?
you put me on that plane to die?
looks like Chuck found the emergency exit at 10, 000 feet.
I would like to apologize for my son's outburst.
as many of you here know, he has long struggled with substance abuse.
I have already contacted the Pedowitz Institute, and I can only hope that he will accept the help that he so desperately needs.
please, let's not let him ruin this otherwise festive evening.
thank you, everybody.
I overestimated you.
you're just lucky that security is getting Chuck home to his suite before he can do any more damage.
at least you know Chuck's okay.
I still despise you, but thank you for doing the right thing for once.
wait a second. Wait a second. Do you know where Serena went?
why would I tell you, even if I did?
so you can con her into falling in love with you and humiliate her again?
no, I was hoping after my speech that maybe she would change her mind about me and about leaving town.
I really hope that you're referring to a vacation spot too elite for the likes of you.
no, I'm talking about L. A. , for good.
I retract everything civil I just said.
this is all your fault.
if Serena moves away, I will never forgive you, Humphrey.
let me guess. Prison overcrowding, or did they let the both of you out on good behavior?
my son never should've been behind bars in the first place.
but look at how the two of you have bonded over it, so you're welcome.
okay, you've had your fun.
now what will it take for you to get your name off my loan document so I can own my paper again?
see, that's the problem with this generation.
they're so entitled. They don't even say "please."
Nate worked his ass off to build that paper.
he never asked you to cosign for him and he's not asking for charity now.
we'll pay whatever it's worth.
a million dollars.
done. I'm kidding. It's not for sale.
the amount of enjoyment I plan on getting watching Nate squirm?
priceless. - Come on, Bart.
don't do this to my kid.
enjoy yourselves tonight, Archibalds. Drinks are on me.
please tell me that you are heading home to get a good night's sleep after a trying day and not picking up your bags and going to the airport.
I'm sorry, Blair. You know I'm terrible at good-byes.
well, I won't let you say one now.
I know that things are bad, but they're never as bad as you think.
you were the one who taught me that.
do you remember junior year, when I was standing out on that helipad, ready to flee to Europe after my "who's the daddy? " pregnancy scandal?
and you weren't even pregnant.
you know, we can laugh about it now because... you didn't let me go.
you told me that the scandal always passes, and so will Dan's expose.
not as long as I live here.
in Los Angeles, no one cares if I date the wrong guy.
I mean, they don't care about anything I do.
I have the chance to reinvent myself.
reinvention is for starlets from trailer parks who want to be you.
seriously, do you know how few friendships make it out of high school?
we finally got to the good part.
you can't leave now.
but you were the one that said we're better when we have our own territories.
remember Paris? Right bank, left bank?
well, then move to the West Side and we'll meet in Central Park!
and when we do, there will be enough light for both of us to shine.
Yeah, but I'd still be living in my own shadow.
I have to go.
but... there's no Sarabeth's in L. A.
or serendipity.
or me.
please just think about it.
leave a message, and I'll listen to it.
Hey, it's me. Why aren't you answering your phone?
thank you for waiting. - I had no choice.
your guards locked me out.
I wanted for us to have a chance to talk privately.
you know, I knew you were cold and ruthless, but I never thought you'd try to kill your own son.
we had a deal. Your friend is out of jail.
you were supposed to be on a plane to Russia.
you never intended for me to make it to Moscow.
you arranged for the pilot to parachute to safety while I was left to die on the plane.
you have always had a wonderfully vivid imagination.
but I warned you earlier... accidents can happen.
we should work together more often.
I'm just over coddling creative types.
there's a whole untapped niche in schemers for hire.
have you seen Chuck?
Bart said that security took him home, but I called Nate.
Chuck's not there and he's not answering his phone.
well, he's here somewhere. He hasn't left the building.
how do you know?
the security guards at the exits are under strict instructions to inform us of all Bass departures.
I have my ways of insuring their loyalty.
Where's Bart?
last time I saw him, he was getting on the elevator.
all I've been trying to do for the past two years is just...
build something that I can be proud of.
instead, I lost it, and my reputation and...
most of my trust fund.
sorry I wasn't there for you sooner, son.
just never wanted you to end up like me.
you didn't end up so bad.
whatever you decide to set your mind to next,
I know you can achieve it.
Thanks, dad.
your dad's right, you know. You can start over.
when I first met you, you had the perfect story to get New York's attention.
what, Gossip Girl's identity?
I promised her I'd stop looking after she helped find Serena.
who knew she was perfectly fine.
she set you up to protect herself.
what do you have to lose by going through your research one more time?
nothing anymore.
in fact, I,uh... I brought it home so that no one at "The Spectator" would find it.
Garcon, where are the stairs? The elevators are taking forever.
what are you doing here? And with a suitcase?
I got an apartment in the building. - What?
I finally realized where I wanna be, and it's here, where you are.
where I used to be. I have no interest in being anywhere around here anymore.
I don't believe that. You run away to... to Spain, upstate, boarding school, Santorini. You always come back.
well, that was then.
that was before I knew what this place could do to people, before I saw it turn you into Bart Bass.
I'm not Bart. But what's wrong with wanting power? You have it.
maybe if you stopped hating it, you'd stop hating yourself.
then you can finally be happy where... where you belong.
okay, you know what? I have no interest in being psychoanalyzed by my evil biographer.
Serena, I know I've hurt you, but I still love you.
I've lost track of it at times. I've made mistakes...
I've made massive, heartbreaking mistakes...
but I've never stopped loving you.
well, excuse me if I don't fall for that, or you, ever again.
please, just... if you come upstairs for a second,
I have something I can show you that'll prove it.
I've seen all I need to see.
I have a plane waiting.
tell me... did you try to have me killed because you hate me so much or because I know too much?
you know, no matter how hard I have tried to turn you into a man, it still remains the one big failure of my life.
you're not a man.
a man accepts responsibility for his actions.
a man takes care of his family.
a man doesn't pay a mother to abandon her child and then tell that child his mother is dead.
a man doesn't try to have his own son killed!
but you can tell the police what kind of a man you are.
your naivete is adorable.
even if I didn't have the police commissioner in my pocket, who do you think they're gonna believe?
the man of the year...
or some sad, pathetic, little boy? !
give me your hand!
you know I'm all talk! I would never really hurt you!
everything you say is a lie!
Charles, this isn't who you are.
please, son!
come on. We have to get out of here.
Hi. you've reached grace,
stanley, heidi, and dawn.
we're not home right now, but if you leave a message,

I think it's a great idea.

I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to call again.
it might be a few days.
I just wanted to tell you that I love you.

its pretty romantic huh?
Oh honey dont worry.
those wont be his last words.
you should consider yourself lucky.
phone sex is nothing compared to what ron did to me the night before he shipped.
I know ï¼Œbut it would never be like that.
with a woman.
Oh, I wouldnt say that.
I've never had to make that kind of good-bye.
why dont we ask stanley what his wife did.
uh well stan?
grace and I had a nice time.
well what did you do?
we put the kids to bed you know.
then we watched leno.
you didnt...
that's really none of anybodys business.
im sorry. its...
I mean it must have been so hard.
no no no. it wasnt hard.
I was proud to see her go.
of course you were.
Mm-hmm.
of course you were. - yeah.
Yeah, were all proud.
I just want them to come home.
when is ron supposed to come home?
january ,if his tour doesnt get extended.
well dont hold your breath.
they always extend.
welcome to the army, honey.
and my prescription medicine cabinet.

I didnt hear you.

when I was a teenager.
Why?
Why? I dont know. it's fun isnt it?

im thinking about it yeah.

law. or medicine. I havent decided yet.
thats great.
what's new with you?
not much.
you all right?
what do you mean am l... l... im fine.
you're not upset?
about what?
uh I dont know. I mean where do I start?
the situations such a mess.
the situation? what situation?
what situation?
I mean it sounds like a fucking mess over there.
watch your language.
sorry. sorry.
you dont know what youre talking about anyway.
who does? the administration?
I mean theyll tell you the sun comes out at midnight
if it serves their cause.
and how about that monkey boy president of yours?
hes your president too.
I didnt vote for him.
you didnt vote at all did you?
that's... that's not the point.
isn't it?
just...
stop talking.
lets not have that conversation right now.
youd like that wouldnt you?
thats what your sides all about isnt it?
censoring dissent?
stop.
Why? I mean were just talking.
are you afraid of talking?
Noï¼Œ im not afraid of that at all.
I just dont want to confuse the girls. is that all right?
im sure theyre already confused.
I mean...
really what do you think about all this?
do you have an opinion?
they think their moms a hero
and they think its easy to criticize the situation
when you are sitting in your moms living room
thinking about going back to school...
maybe law maybe med... I dont know.
they think every one of those privileged opinions
is a freedom that their mother fights for daily
on your behalf.
that's what they think.
well it's... it's good to see
that you let them think for themselves.
you girls hungry?
you think your dad will buy us lunch?
its 4: 30 man.
you think your dad will buy us dinner?
want to buy uncle john dinner?
you dont want to come?
no I think im just going to stay here and...
take a little cat nap.
youre bigger than the last time I saw you.
how old are you now?
dawns 8. im 121/2.
how old are you?
32
bet that sounds pretty old to you doesnt it?
do you have a job?
Why? are you hiring?
no.
hey how come you kids are out of school?
dads taking us to enchanted gardens.
Why? - for fun.
you think that place is fun?
what do you mean?
nothing.
uncle john?
Yeah.
why did dad quit the army?
he didnt quit.
what do you mean?
he had to leave because of his eyes.
the armys strict about crap like that.
but werent his eyes always bad?
Mm more or less.
well if they're so strict
Howd he get in in the first place?
he didn't tell you?
Oh christ.
well if he didnt tell you
he probably wouldnt want me to so...
all right you promise not to tell your dad if I tell you.
he cheated.
how?
he had a buddy take a picture of the physical examiners eye chart.
memorized the letters.
what?
your dad wanted to serve so bad.
I mean he really bought
all that patriotic I want you crap.
which was a good thing too
because he never would have met your mother otherwise.
well how'd the army find out about his eyes?
eventually they just gave him a test he couldn't cheat on
and that was that.
end of the dream.
why dont you and dad like each other?
did your dad tell you that?
well were just... were just different.
we have different opinions.
doesn't mean we dont like each other.
I mean do you agree with him about everything?
you shouldnt.
why not?
because it's important
that people have their own views
based on an understanding of facts.
but its also important not to trust the facts,
because most of them are lies.
I dont understand.
well it basically comes down to a...
gut thing.
you just have to be open to allowing,
for a truth which differs from your own opinions,
or else youll never actually see the truth at all.
what's that about?
its her time of day.
what its... its her time of day?
mom and dawn both set their watches
at the same time every day.
that way they know
that they're both thinking of each other at the same moment.
girls?
yeah?
yeah?
do you...
want to play tag?
sure.
thats good. because...
you know why?
Why?
Becauseï¼Œuhï¼Œyou're it.
you're it.
you're it. time out.
what do you mean time out?
you cant call time out.
that is so lame. you cant just...
all right. im just going to read the paper and find out whats going...
time in.
you know I mean it's so typical.
I'm the victim of this kind of thing every single day
and you know why?
its because i'm an honest guy,
and I have to pay for it.
Mm-hmm.
hey the phones ringing. open up.
hello.
yeah this is john.
Oh hey mary.
what the hell are you doing man?
whats wrong? where are the girls?
the girls are fine.

we got to go.
Stan what are you doing to them?
I'm taking them on a trip.
just stay out of it.
stay out of it?
you're the one who brought me into it.
I didnt bring you into anything.
you were just here. I didnt plan that.
do you really think
that... that... that taking them to an amusement park
is going to help them get over losing their mother?
just stay out of it. - you're going to screw those girls up.
is that what you want to do?
get out of my way. - they'll never forgive you.
get out of my way!
nobody asked you! do you understand?
I got to go.

Yeah.

dad?
do you ever think
that mom should have stayed home?
all the time.
why did she have to go?
she was doing her duty, heidi you know that.
I know ,but what exactly does that mean?
we've talked about this.
we have people all over the world
looking out for our safety.
when they discover a threat
they have to act on it.
that's the way the world is.
on the news they're saying
that we went to war with the wrong people
that it was all a lie.
well you can't always believe
everything you hear on television can you?
sometimes you just got to trust
that you're doing the right thing.
we got to believe...
well what if you can't?
then were all lost.
Hi. you've reached grace, stanley,
Heidi, and dawn.
we're not home right now,
but if you leave a message,
we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
Hey. it's stanley and the girls.
I just wanted to hear your voice on the machine
and tell you that were all right.
were in florida.
I told you we were going to florida right?
taking the girls on a little trip.
anyway do you remember that uh...
I was thinking that when we...
when we came down here before you shipped out
and I just... I wanted to apologize
because uh...
because I was so angry back then
and uh I just wanted to let you know
I was thinking that...
that the reason I was so angry
was because I was ashamed...
that it was you who was going and not me.
we would have been better off if it was me.
the girls would have been better off.
and I made such a fucking mess out of this thing.
grace im such a mess.
l... I dont...
know how to talk to these girls.
I haven't even told them.
so you got to tell me what to do... grace.
please, god, tell me what to do.
so how do I say it?
you got to tell me what to do.
who were you talking to?
school.
Mrs. shimerhorn.
Mrs. shimerhorn?
she said everythings going to be fine
but we got to get that report in
and do a couple of makeup assignments
but uh to enjoy the trip.
so lets go.

we got to get some sleep
because weve got a big day tomorrow okay.
okay.
big day.
let's stay up all night.
okay.
we can, we must, and we will see it through to completion ,the mission for which these young americans "and their families have sacrificed, "carrying with us the memory "of those who have lost their lives "in the battle.
we ask our commanders on the ground "at every opportunity "if there's something we ought to be doing differently.
in our 200-plus years, "america has learned some important lessons, "and one is that weakness is provocative.
it tempts aggression.
that appeasement is...
Hey. it's stanley and the girls.
I just wanted to hear your voice on the machineï¼Œ
and tell you that we're all right.
we're in florida.
I told you we were going to florida, right?
taking the girls on a little trip.
anyway, do you remember that, uh...
I was thinking that when we...
when we came down here before you shipped out,
and I just thought I wanted to apologize
because, uh...
because I was so angry back then,
and, uh, I just wanted to let you know
I was thinking that...
that the reason I was so angry
was because I was ashamed...
you look like youre ready to go.
I am.
Oh that dress looks pretty.
Thanks.
Where's your sister?

outside doing what?
I dont know. some heidi thing.
Oh right.
what are you doing out here all by yourself?
you all right sweetheart?
Yeah. how are you?
me? im just fine.
just fine.
slept like a rock
which is good.
you know your sisters just about ready to burst
she's so excited.
what do you think? you want to get going?
sure. sure.
dad?
nothing.
have an enchanted day.
this way...
or this way?
do you want this balloon?
Yeah. I like blue.
I dont know. this is kind of...
this is a powerful balloon.
I dont know if I should let you hold it.
that's a big balloon.
Heidi heidi hold your sister.
hold your sister down.
hold her. hold her.
the winds going to take her away.
what do you want to do now?
lets go.
Yeah.
you want to leave?
I did everything I wanted to do.
okay.
come on.
why aren't we on the highway?
lets get out of the car.
sit down.
I need to tell you something...
and it's something I should have told you a lot earlier.
you know your mother and I love you very very very much.
dawn.
Yeah.
nothings ever going to change that.
ever.
do you remember when we talked about things
that could happen while she was away?
well your mother was hurt.
she was hurt real bad.
where is she?
she was hurt so bad they couldn't fix her.
she's just hurt right?
dad.
she's just hurt.
where is she?
it's okay dawn.
well take care of her. she's just hurt.
your mom is a soldier
and soldiers sometimes get hurt
and sometimes they even...
die in battle.
and that's what happened.
grace ann phillips
was born in newport, indiana, on october 3, 1971.
she was a happy child
who loved spending time outdoors.
once she even spent an entire summer
sleeping in a refrigerator box
in her mother's backyard.
she waterproofed it with garbage bags
so she could sleep in it even when it rained.
grace was a brave woman.
she enlisted in the army right out of high school.
she met my father, stanley phillips,
at boot camp in fort knox, kentucky,
later that summer.
they married after training was over.
my father says that, to this day,
he's still surprised mom said yes,
which is funny because mom used to tell
my sister and me she was worried
he was never going to ask the big question.
grace and stanley loved each other very much.
they were best friends.
anyone who knew grace
knows she was a special person.
she was kind generous and funny.
she had a loud silly laugh
you could hear even when you were in the next room.
and she could sing better than anyone.
well miss her very much.
but we promise to always think of you,
when we laugh wake up,
fall asleep,
and look at the ocean.
I promise to keep your memory with us forever.
is it time?
not yet.
okay get ready.
so what do I do?
you do what you need to do to make it right in your mind.
how about some breakfast? - Later, Cap.
purity pledge, activate. - Amen!
you have to choose.
her or me?
you don't want me to choose.
what's the story with the scruffy Kappa Tau who looks like Rob Thomas?
he was talking to Casey this morning.
Oh, God. Casey made the mistake of dating Cappie freshman year.
$275?
he said he was buying.
you want me to bail you dorks out or not?
look around. Some day this could all be yours.
how did you know about that video? - I sent it to you.
we can still move our relationship forward.
it's after 3: 00, and no word. That's not good.
our house is at the end of Greek row.
they have four other nominees to give roses to.
I'm sure they'll show up any minute.
any word? - No,
I'm competing with every girl in the Greek system.
case, you know, maybe not being nominated for "Omega Chi Sweetheart" wouldn't be the end of the world.
or maybe it would.
no sister has ever been elected president of ZBZ without taking "Sweetheart of Omega Chi" first.
well, there was Vanessa Davis in '95, but she had scoliosis and played the whole "I've-overcome-obstacles-thing" to gain sympathy votes.
so it's possible without.
but not with your posture.
so Casey's entire political future at Zeta Beta Zeta depends on this moment?
okay, I'm just gonna stop with the helping.
being nominated "Omega Chi Sweetheart," it's like running in the primaries.
if you don't take New Hampshire... - It's 3: 05.
maybe we should think of some obscure disease you could be suffering from.
let's plan a Gray's Anatomy marathon just in case.
Oh, my God! - Yes! Yes, yes!
okay, God, this is so exciting. It's almost like it's happening to me again.
it is my pleasure to announce your official nomination to the court of "Sweetheart of Omega Chi.
I accept!
Hey. - Hey.
sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find my dorm key, and then I realized that it was in my room, which was locked.
my roommate was, like, absolutely no help.
come on in.
I missed you.
it was the longest 3 1/2 hours of my life.
so, uh...
Yeah.
do you think you want, you know, you might...
that's why I said "yeah" just now.
I wasn't sure. - It's okay.
I didn't want it to be awkward.
wait, where's Dale? - It's Wednesday, so he'll be at the biology building for another 20 minutes, and then he'll get his cherry limeade and cheese, which will take another 8 to 11 minutes depending on pedestrian traffic.
you know, this'll be our third time. - Fourth.
maybe.
Yeah, I don't know. I wasn't keeping track or anything.
ignore it. It must be broken or something.
Rusty! Did you say Wednesday? It's Thursday.
he'll freak if he catches us.
what a waste.
thermodynamics and heat transfer analysis?
my little sister could teach that class.
I'm gonna check my Second Life stock.
you wanna see my new avatar?
what are you guys doing?
nothing. - Nothing.
winning the title of "Omega Chi Sweetheart
is completely dependent on your personal interaction with each and every Omega Chi, as well as catering to their basic needs.
um, hello! We're ZBZs, not Tri Pis.
not those needs. Right?
of course not. This isn't the Clinton administration.
think more Laura Bush. - Ew.
trust me, the Omega Chis aren't looking for a girl who swigs beer and shows off her whale tail.
this girl represents the fraternity publicly, so they're wanting less Ginger and more Mary Ann.
this is the girl they want to bring home to mother Bush.
now, I like to take the two-pronged approach:
win their stomachs, and then win their hearts.
so let's start talking baked goods.
I was thinking maybe something in a scone.
Casey's not much of a baker.
but I can drive to the store, buy some muffins, wrap 'em up to make 'em look homemade, right?
genius. - I've been inspired by the master.
I only wish I had a me for inspiration last year.
Oh, my God. I was so nervous.
despite completely dominating the competition.
it seems like so long ago.
I can barely even remember Blake coming over to the ZBZ house, presenting me with my white rose.
muffins?
Oh! Right. Okay.
next topic: Current events.
ten things you should know about fantasy football.
how about tomorrow night?
Yep, that should be good.
could we use your room? - I don't think so.
my roommate Stephanie could barely make it past the dresser this morning.
she needs to go to Student Health.
that's the problem, she's agoraphobic.
she can't really "go" anywhere.
she spends all day on the internet talking into her little web cam.
it's like living with LonelyGirl15.
what about your room? Tonight?
hold on. Let me check Dale's schedule.
is this weird?
trying to have sex around Dale's schedule? It's getting weird, right?
I mean, I know he has some issues, but...
some" issues?
then can't we just tell him that we'd like to have the room for one evening?
don't you think you have as much of a right to personal time as he does?
Yeah, you're right.
it's not like being baptist qualifies as a debilitating medical condition.
I'll talk to him. - Good.
cause I'd kinda like to get into the double digits.
what?
Bye. - Bye.
Hey, Cappie!
wait up!
Spitter!
it's a beautiful day, wouldn't you...
you look different.
haircut?
hmm, maybe I look different because I had sex?
no, that's not it. Are you wearing a bronzer?
I lost my virginity.
Ah, Mazel Tov, young man.
how's it going in the afterglow? - Great.
it'd be better if I didn't have a roommate who's a born-again Christian with a light class schedule.
logistical problems.
well, I'd be happy to let you use my deluxe accommodations.
Really? You don't mind?
absolutely not.
only 20 bucks an hour. For reservations, contact Wade.
we are booked for the next two weeks. However, after finals I am expecting a lull.
two weeks?
I need the cash flow, bro. I've got some debts to pay off.
hold, please.
you can't get me in any sooner?
do you have triple A?
would that matter? - No.
never mind, I'll just have to talk to Dale.
he's probably just finishing his Fruit Roll-Up.
side effects may include nausea, blindness, decapitation, rectal oozing.
this is not a pharmaceutical study.
I know, I was just hiding behind witticism to mask the resentment of an unfulfilled childhood.
the intent of this experiment is to examine theories of behavioral psychology.
tomorrow's experiment will begin with "the stroop" task.
I think I had "the stroop" once.
and we will be adding environmental stressors over time.
we're exploring the Gestalt perceptual laws of organization.
the test requires you to stay awake for 30 hours.
30 hours?
one of our psych lower-division undergrads will be with you for the duration of the test to supervise and record your responses.
Oh, I love being supervised and recorded.
we'll start tomorrow afternoon.
be sure to bring plenty of food and liquids with you. No alcohol.
uh, it's weird. Most students can't resist a joke.
clearly I'm not most students.
clearly.
the student who will administer the test is participating for a grade, but understand this is a professional study.
you'll be expected to answer every question the administrator gives you.
you'll be given access to a bathroom, but that is it for 30 hours.
ms. Logan, please come meet your test subject.
this is case study 8675309.
rob Thomas guy? - Actually, your subject's name is...
unimportant.
remember, Logan, we don't see things as they are.
we see things as we are.
I used to be a psych major.
Hey, Rus.
I finished your milk. But I can get some more.
no problem.
off to calculus?
Parlin Hall, from 2: 00 to 4: 00?
you know me well.
I kinda wanted to talk to you about something.
Oh, I gotta talk to you about something too.
well, if I could go first...
Doreen Dresselhaus McCaw is coming to CRU!
Dale, she's a nuclear physicist, not a rock star.
uh, excuse me, but her work in proton emulsion has literally rocked the world.
anyway, she's giving an open lecture tomorrow.
I thought we could go. - Tomorrow? Sure.
that sounds fine. - Great.
and then... Maybe...
perhaps...
I could possibly have the room...
alone...
with Jen.
Oh. I see.
Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
Really?
Yeah, you know.
love the sinner, hate the sin, right?
is that a yes?
Yeah, just give me some notice. I'll disappear. - Wow!
this really means a lot to me.
thank you.
all right, buddy, tomorrow it is. Just you, me, and Doreen Dresselhaus McCaw.
and it never occurred to you that in order to be pre-med, you might need to take some Actual Science classes?
I did.
I took biology and chemistry, didn't I? - You didn't take chemistry.
nor physics... - Well,
I figured those would start when I finished the pre part and got to the med.
sorry. - But what about my dream of becoming a gorgeous but troubled intern in a hospital full of other gorgeous interns discussing my love life while performing complex surgeries and hating my mother?
try the drama department.
well, are... Are there any exceptions?
by the way, um, I'm not just saying this, but I love your glasses.
if you plan to graduate with any degree from this institution, you're going to need to complete a fifth year here at Cyprus-Rhodes.
I mean, with the way HMOs are cutting into profit margins, it just doesn't make sense for me to go into medicine anyway.
so I'm thinking pre-law, perhaps.
regardless, I'm staying for a fifth year here at CRU!
Yay!
isn't that great, Case?
Yeah!
Hey, let's get drinks to celebrate.
are you really okay with this?
my parents are gonna freak out when they find out they have to pay for a fifth year. And of course that means
I'm never gonna get to be...
an Izzy.
or a Meredith. I know. I'm so sorry.
you know me so well.
I really need to think of something to keep my mind off things.
how about a spa weekend?
I don't think so. - How about we charter
Rebecca's jet... Yay.
it's all so empty.
is there something you had in mind?
I knew you'd understand.
I was thinking about running for "Omega Chi Sweetheart" again.
Oh. Is that possible?
totally. I've already checked into it, and as the formerly-crowned "Omega Chi Sweetheart
I have the right to run again.
so we'd be running against each other.
wouldn't that be bad? - Yes.
it'd split the ZBZ vote.
and if that happens, you know who loses.
exactly.
so what you're saying is I need to drop out of the Sweetheart race for the good of the house?
I mean, if that's what you feel like you should do,
I totally support you in that. - But Frannie, what about the primaries? And all that stuff you said about New Hampshire and the ZBZ presidency?
all that was just a theory.
you could still be president without being Omega Chi Sweetheart.
you just have to work a little harder.
that's all.
you know what?
I'm feeling better already.
Hi. - Hi.
so what's the process of removing myself from the running?
wait a minute.
are you sure you wanna do this?
Frannie's my big sis.
she's done so much for me.
the advice, the encouragement.
and I admire your loyalty.
I do. But you really wanted this.
is it your fault that she's not graduating on time?
it's complicated.
she's, like, my mentor and my friend.
well, then you know what?
this should just be some friendly competition.
she's had her time.
she needs to exit the stage gracefully, and...
well, I shouldn't be telling you this.
she might not be the most popular ZBZ at the Omega Chi house.
you think I could beat Frannie?
I don't know if you've noticed, but I have been running quite the campaign.
that's the most adorable thing I've ever seen.
listen, Frannie's already had her reign. All right?
it's your turn now.
my weekend with the senator's daughter.
sounds kinky.
we'll start with "the stroop" task.
the objective of this test is to measure your reaction time as it relates to your brain's unconscious.
so is this your major?
I don't get credit for small talk.
let's start the test, shall we?
what is your hurry?
we have all weekend.
besides, I like to get to know my supervisor before I stroop her.
it really is an amazing word that can be used in many different ways.
maybe it's time you start cooperating, or...
or I'll tell everyone on campus your real name.
name the color this word is written in.
red.
correct.
Rusty! I saved you...
a seat.
I didn't know you had an interest in nuclear fission, Jennifer.
well, I figured if it was important to Rusty, that I should learn a little bit about it.
I see. - Dale, do you mind if
jen and I sit together?
no, sure.
that's a better seat up there anyway.
Yes!
nice play, Cartwright.
Hey, Frannie. The guys are loving the smoothies. Big hit.
so sweet of you to come out and support my campaign, Case.
actually, I'm not here in support of your candidacy.
then why are you here?
um. I hope you understand.
but I've decided that I'm not going to drop out of the race.
wait. You're not dropping out?
not that I think I'll win or anything.
of course not.
so why run?
um, you know, this is my junior year, and it's my only chance, since I'm going to graduate on time.
not that I'm super-proud of that or anything.
I mean, a lot of people do fifth years. It's common.
and if I should happen to win, that'd be better than losing to some Tri Pis, right?
Yes, it would...
if I was planning on losing.
good luck, sweetie.
have you seen my milk? I just bought a half gallon yesterday.
no, sure haven't.
why is my milk in the trash?
Oh, that milk.
I thought that expired.
after one day? It's not even open.
well, maybe you shouldn't buy such a big carton, so it doesn't take up so much room in the fridge.
we agreed to share the fridge though.
no, we did, but that means half, not three-quarters.
see, your milk crossed the border.
okay. Um, so Jen and I were thinking about using the room tomorrow night.
you know what, Rusty? That's... That's not gonna work for me.
what about Sunday night?
now, that is really not gonna work for me.
but you said you were okay with it before.
you know I'm a complex individual. I change my mind.
so what do you think?
which... Which shoes?
well, you know, they always say you can never go wrong with a Peep Toe.
who's they?
I don't know. I was just tryin' to help.
again.
what would Frannie say?
she seriously hasn't spoken one word to you since the game?
I've seen her six times, and she just smiles and walks away.
this morning at breakfast she winked at me.
well, that's scary. - Yeah.
have you... - What?
uh... Do you think that she's gonna wanna run for president?
I can't read her. I'm not sure if she's being passive-aggressive or just totally cool about all of this.
I have no idea where her head is.
there you are.
Hi. Frannie.
getting ready for the big night?
Yeah, I was just trying to decide what shoes to wear.
Oh, definitely the Peep Toes. Demure but inviting.
so how's the speech coming?
all done.
I expect nothing less.
may the best woman win.
Oh, and don't be late. If you miss the speeches, you're automatically disqualified.
Bye.
I can't believe you worked everything out with Dale.
Yeah, it's great.
why is your stuff all piled up over here on the floor?
I think Dale's cleaning or something.
the Dale tracker again? I thought you said you talked through all this.
something's wrong with my computer.
did you reboot it?
that's weird, it says the signal is coming from...
where?
inside the room.
did you really think I wouldn't figure this out?
GPS with a five-mile radius? Please.
got milk, Rusty?
Jen, you should go.
um, okay.
Bye, Dale.
rusty, call me.
tell me what you see.
I see me taking a nap.
you can sleep when you're finished. Answer the question.
two triangles and three circles.
wrong! There are no actual triangles or circles in the image.
isn't there a rule that the supervisor has to avoid showing her personal feelings about the subject?
maybe. This is my first class.
well, there should be.
this is like being at a slumber party with Jack Bauer.
I know how hard you work to pretend nothing ever bothers you.
stop. I'll tell you where the nukes are.
next topic, aural stimuli.
you wish.
I'm gonna play a sound, and you identify what it is.
first thing that pops in your mind.
Evan Chambers losing his allowance.
Oh, come on, that deserves a check.
but it's so much more fun to be wrong, isn't it?
I don't know. Is it?
little Miss Perfect has her Cinderella ball tonight.
doesn't bother you that Casey picked another Prince Charming?
I don't get paid for small talk. - Uh-huh.
should we get back to the test?
I don't know anything about this. Where's Frannie?
she's not here, but he said your name's on the work order too.
this is Casey Cartwright.
I'm John the plumber. A Frannie Morgan called earlier.
said you needed some pipes replaced.
but tonight? They've been leaking for months.
Oh, she insisted. Said it was an emergency.
it had to be taken care of today.
uh, so I'm gonna need to shut this water off for a while.
okay, well, uh, give us a few minutes to finish getting ready, and then it's all yours.
well, I'm gonna need you or Miss Morgan here until I finish.
your names are on the work order. You gotta sign off.
it's company policy. I told her that on the phone.
well, how long did you tell her this was going to take?
that depends on the condition of the pipes.
uh, we could be here all night.
the Greek system at CRU is certainly not what it used to be.
you've seen the Kappa Tau house, right?
disgusting.
and those girls at Mu Gamma Pig...
uh, what did I just say?
I meant Sig.
the speeches are about to start. I was afraid you weren't going to make it.
here I am.
the plumbing's all taken care of.
great, I'm glad it wasn't as extensive as I thought.
no, it was exactly as extensive as you thought.
it would have taken all night, but it turns out Jen K's dad's a plumber, and she was able to help.
John the plumber actually offered her a job.
I hope you encouraged her to take it.
Hey, Frannie.
great game the other day.
Travis says I don't know how to follow. I'm a total follower.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but, uh, Travis might be right.
well, thanks for being my handsome escort for tonight.
I am lucky to have such a beautiful lady on my arm.
and my feet. - Ooh-ooh. I'm sorry.
it's okay. - Sorry.
so give me the dirt. How's the Sweetheart race looking?
uh, my money's on Casey.
this is it!
come on in.
I heard about the honors engineering floor, but I thought it was a joke.
it's real. Want something to drink?
Yeah. Sure.
cool flag. You English?
Hey, Beaver, why don't you tell Dale how you got your name?
Hey, Dale.
all right, last test.
emotions can have an important effect on perception.
emotions play a larger role in perception under stress or extreme circumstances.
so what do you see?
a dog.
correct answer is cloud.
who looks at a cloud and just sees a cloud?
me.
look. The dog's head's over there. The legs are in the back.
it's a boy.
I don't see it.
maybe you're projecting.
I always wanted a dog.
we moved around too much. And chances are my parents would have accidentally killed it anyway.
I'm so tired, I feel drunk.
I am seriously on the verge of singing the Kenny Rogers songbook or making some embarrassing true confessions.
so why would your parents have accidentally killed the dog?
let's just say there wasn't an abundance of stability.
my parents are hippies with all kinds of great ideals, but they're not the most responsible people.
got it.
you know what your problem is? - What?
perspective.
come sit over here. Look at it this way.
come on.
it kind of looks like a bong.
oddly enough, I don't see that.
I used to see everything in terms of whether it would piss off my parents.
bongs did that.
you like to walk on the wild side, huh?
not anymore.
the whole out-of-control rich girl thing got to be a little too Lindsay Lohan-ish.
you know, you're not nearly as unpleasant as I thought you'd be, Logan.
I know.
you smell better than I thought you would.
what kind of hippies would name you...
Nah, shh.
hippies with a finely-honed sense of irony.
time's up.
this concludes our experiment.
thanks to both of you.
here is your compensation for participating.
I'll see you in class on Tuesday.
those are the real weapons of mass destruction. Am I right?
you guys are awesome.
just remember, a vote for me is a vote against the terrorists.
God bless America!
Frannie, can we please stop this?
I know you're angry with me, so why don't we stop pretending?
pretending?
I don't know what you're talking about.
just because your plans changed, doesn't mean
I should have to give up on everything I've worked so hard for.
can you please put your own political ambitions aside and think of someone other than yourself?
you started all this.
and you knew how important this was to me.
but you wouldn't drop out.
I should have known you'd stop at nothing to get ahead.
after all, you took Evan back even though he cheated on you.
No!
I didn't back up!
Dale, what happened?
maybe some prankster hacked into the university power grid and shut you down.
and drained my battery so it wouldn't work, either?
I'm going to have sex, Dale. Deal with it.
this isn't about sex, Rusty. - Then what?
when school started, I thought you were this cool, smart engineering guy who understood the importance of things like comic-con and nuclear physics...
you're still talking about that stupid lecture?
that stupid lecture was important to me, okay?
and I thought it was important to you.
I thought that our friendship was more important.
we're not friends, Dale.
we're roommates.
well, maybe you should find a new roommate.
maybe I will.
when I came to Cyprus-Rhodes, I knew nothing about the Greek system.
at first glance it seemed like a great way to have fun.
what I quickly discovered was an incredible group of people who I will have a special bond with forever.
I wondered where that unconditional bond comes from.
what I've learned, thanks to some very special people in my life, is that, well, for me anyway, being Greek is about tradition.
and passing that tradition onto others.
that proud passing of the torch keeps the integrity of our Greek system alive.
it's our foundation.
I found someone who was selflessly willing to pass her legacy on to me.
someone I see not only as a mentor, but as a friend.
but no matter what happens, till the day I die,
I will always be sweet on the boys of Omega Chi.
um, all right, you guys, it's time to cast the votes.
okay.
okay, the votes are in.
and the title of "Omega Chi Sweetheart" of 2007
goes to...
Oh, my Gosh.
at least that bitch didn't win again.
too bad you have to live with her.
the best girl won.
can you believe that Tri Pis and her "wardrobe malfunction?
Rusty! Oh, you should have seen Casey.
Casey, great.
Dale's out of control.
he hacked my power.
I lost my paper.
there's milk everywhere.
and... - Um...
I'll catch up with you guys later.
are you okay?
you seem a little worked up.
will you come back to my room and have sex with me in front of Dale?
Rusty! - That's my only logical recourse.
rusty, let it go.
if he doesn't want us in his room, then that's fine.
we'll figure something out.
maybe I can put in a transfer to another room or something.
no, I'll do it. - And leave Dale?
you're willing to leave Stephanie.
because she's an agoraphobe who scares me.
but Dale's a germaphobe who's constantly butting into my business.
and studying with you and going to lectures with you, and watching Planet Earth...
Yes.
and didn't he teach you how to play hockey and show up at your intramural game?
Yes. But he...
what about the volcano? He committed a crime for you.
there's no way we could have pulled that off without him.
I mean, without Dale, who knows if we'd even be together.
but he's a conservative, right-wing southern baptist with a confederate flag on the wall.
and you're a frat guy who is asking him to push his religious beliefs aside so that you can have sex with your girlfriend.
Yeah, you guys definitely have your differences, but when you add it all up, you and Dale are friends.
I'm exhausted.
at least you got paid.
but the knowledge you received was far more valuable.
right.
you realize it was totally pointless.
the slides, the tests, all of it.
I'm not sure all of it was.
what happened in that room means nothing in the real world.
there is no real world.
just two strangers picked to sit in a room and get their lives taped.
see ya around.
Hey!
okay, that's wonderful.
I'm awake now.
sorry.
look, Dale... - I asked around and a couple other guys on this floor dropped out, so if you still wanna change rooms...
I don't wanna change rooms.
unless you still want me to.
maybe.
you know, you're right about Jen.
no appreciation for Doreen.
Yeah, well, few do.
sometimes showing appreciation is a hard thing to do.
you mean like showing appreciation for me?
Yes, I mean you.
so you mean you appreciate me.
exactly.
you appreciate me like a good roommate?
I appreciate you like a good friend.
so I bought some cookie dough for all that milk.
you want some?
Nah, no thanks.
cookie dough salmonella can kill you.
good night, Rusty.
good night, Dale.
Hey.
Hey.
great speech tonight.
really tugged on those heartstrings.
I tried to find you after the announcement, but I guess you'd already left.
I know when to make my exit.
I meant what I said.
we're friends, first and foremost.
what's on your mind?
al Gore.
I'm more of a Jake Gyllenhall girl myself.
no, I was actually thinking about how crazy it is that someone can win the popular vote, and still not be elected president.
Yeah. That's pretty crazy.
enjoy your win, poodle.
doesn't last forever.
don't stay up too late.
guess I missed the fun.
this is for you.
it's from Cappie.
payback's a bitch, and so am I.
you gotta be pretty smart to get in the engineering program.
how'd you know? - This is the honors engineering floor.
I found out you had sex with Evan Chambers.
I did, rush night, and it was amazing!
Evan Chambers is my boyfriend.
how awkward for you.
so what do I do?
you do what you need to do to make it right in your mind.
you guys play football?
I played for a year...
in Little League.
we could kick your ass at anything...
Really? - Yeah, we could.
I'm not gay.
we were just drunk.
who sent it? - I bet it's from Rebecca.
she didn't do this. Someone else is holding the camera.
I'll delete it. - No, wait.
Where'd you get that?
I'm willing to bet you didn't get attention from your dad growing up.
wanna get his attention now?
howe comes up from the outside, setting up his shot.
shoots!
you might want to aim away from the goal next time.
I'm improving though.
that's all that matters.
did you know during his 20-year career in the NHL,
Wayne Gretzky scored 894 goals, had 1, 963 assists?
that's 2, 857 points.
no.
I didn't know you were so into hockey. - I'm not.
I've never even watched a game before.
but I've never played beer pong before either.
Yeah, don't remind me.
the Kappa Tau's first floor hockey game of the season is today,
I just want to be ready.
it's just intramural sports.
I know. But I never really got to play sports in high school.
this is something I feel like I can really do...
playing sports with the guys.
doing guy stuff.
Yeah, enjoy your guy thing, Gretzky.
I gotta get back to the house.
aren't you gonna play for the Omega Chis?
Nah, sounds like work.
open net,
rusty Cartwright all by himself, setting up his shot.
he shoots!
how 'bout giving me a two-minute head start?
sorry.
I asked for a Sumatra with a splash of soy, not a latte with whole.
you don't want me to get fat, do you?
get?
what?
question.
if I wanted to leak a sex video onto the internet, could I do that straight from my phone?
nothing starts the day off right like that first cup of Joe.
after all, your first is always the best, don't you agree?
the one that's the most special?
the one you can never avoid?
the one you can never forget.
you guys are way into your coffee.
pardon... I spy a tasty morning muffin.
top o' the mornin', muffin.
ready to get slaughtered by the Lambda Sigs?
you're forgetting the fact that we have the Beaver, the number-one recruit for CRU Football.
and the Lambda Sigs have numbers 2 through 30.
never discount the underdog.
here you go.
try this.
I think I want an iced coffee.
might I recommend a Cappie-cino?
go play your sports.
is that you?
do you think I can get a chance to play?
I'm ready.
I've been practicing.
can you see those huge guys out there with the sticks?
good, because I can't.
which might be a sign of a concussion.
wait, there they are.
be right back...
I can't get past their new goalie.
that guy's a friggin' machine. - Come on, Beav, the Kappa Taus never say die.
the Kappa Taus are dead.
it looks like we're going to be going up against the Lambda Sigs next round.
o'toole, will you do me a favor and do some recon work on that goalie?
as athletic support liaison for Omega Chis, it's my job to solicit ideas on how I can effectively support you.
bake cookies, paint signs.
how 'bout a pep rally?
how about just this?
good, 'cause I hate baking cookies.
I mean, how hard is it to embroider
ZBZ hearts Omega Chis on a polo?
I could make some calls for you.
Casey will figure it out. She's always my point for special projects.
do you think I could put my name into the mix for an assignment?
sweetie, pledges don't get assignments.
I was just thinking that you might make an exception, considering my political experience and my dad's house in Jackson Hole.
could be fun for a committee retreat.
let me ponder.
what's the story with the scruffy Kappa Tau who looks like Rob Thomas?
he was talking to Casey this morning. - Oh, God!
he just can't get over it.
Casey made the mistake of dating Cappie freshman year.
he's ridiculous, has no discernable goals.
we considered with holding her activation because of that unholy alliance.
luckily she came to her senses and dumped him.
I love learning about my big sis.
you!
time-out!
all right...
we're down three goals, there's a minute left in the game. There's only one thing we can do.
start drinking now.
this game's over.
pledge.
Yes, sir.
all fours, please. Thank you.
Hey, Rudy...
hop in, don't die.
okay, you got it.
you the man, Spitter!
they're putting Rusty in?
this should be good. - It's gonna be bad.
very, very bad.
I think we met on rush night.
great. You ready for pain?
is that a trick question?
is that over? - Yeah!
nice going, Spitter.
you just scored against your own team.
they really should mark those?
I said take off the mask!
the Lambda sigs are disqualified for the improper use of a professional athlete...
the Kappa Taus will play the Omega Chis.
on your feet, pledge Owens!
dad?
unbelievable.
22 years, this place hasn't changed.
of course, we did a better job at keeping it clean.
but you goats will learn.
what are you doing here?
I believe that's my line.
I've been in college four weeks.
are you suffering from invasion of privacy withdrawal?
it's the first weekend of the IM Sports season.
I thought I'd come watch you play.
imagine my surprise when I went to the gym, and you were nowhere to be found.
I guess I forgot.
you loved hockey in high school.
look, our agreement required me to pledge your fraternity.
all right? That's all.
do they know?
no.
and I'm not planning on telling them.
this couldn't be the same chair.
I was dating this ZBZ...
what's her face... - Dad...
I won't get into details, - But let's just... - Let's just stop right there.
a singing Beaver, now I've seen everything.
muffin!
I missed you.
tell me about you...
the Kappa Taus... Cappie.
Kappa Taus win...
on a technicality... shocker.
don't worry, we'll beat you gals fair and square.
like you've ever beaten us at anything.
one word...
beer pong.
you are a joke, do you know that?
no, it's all right, Beaver.
I mean if Spitter can take him down with a paddle,
I think I can take care of myself.
it's just too bad you couldn't take care of Casey.
now why'd you have to go and bring that up?
he took care of her all night long during rush.
down, Beav!
I'll see you on the court.
I bought a ton of stuff to rally the Omega Chis.
pledge Rebecca, would you unload my car, please?
I'll let you two talk first.
come sit, let's chat.
lemonade?
sure.
now that the game is going to be between the Omega Chis and the Kappa Taus,
I have some concerns about our athletic support program.
that's some lemonade.
I feel like this is my fault, even though it isn't.
when I told you to even the score with Evan,
I meant go find some cute barrista without a last name...
not your skeezy ex.
what are you talking about?
Rebecca heard it from something called Beaver.
apparently he announced it after the game, in front of everyone.
including Evan.
Oh, God.
she felt awful telling me, but she did it to protect you.
and us.
there's a potential conflict of interest here.
wait, are you questioning my loyalty?
I'm not, sweetie, but it's about outside perception.
I have decided to have Rebecca replace you as athletic support liaison until this whole thing blows over.
she's a pledge.
she has a lot of ideas about how to take it to the next level.
but she's a pledge.
you're replacing me with a pledge?
Casey, let me impart for a second.
an important aspect of being a leader is the ability to manage your mistakes.
remember when Cheney shot that man in the face?
he went underground for a couple days in a bunker, laid low, and before you know it, the guy he shot was apologizing to him.
genius, right?
Yes, but...
I'm just trying to help you.
please, for your own good, go underground.
I was thinking maybe I can be more useful on defense.
it's a big game, Spitter.
it's bigger than all of us.
the classic battle between good and Evan.
beer pong started a winning streak against the Omega Chis that I'm ready to defend to the death.
I did win at beer pong.
Absolutely.
you're the MVP of beer pong.
we gotta put our good guys in this time around to destroy Evan Chambers.
I know Evan's a jerk, but what'd he do to you?
we go way back.
I've hated Evan for almost two years now, since we roomed together freshman year.
what happened freshman year?
long story.
but you understand as much as anyone that kicking Evan's ass can only mean good things.
so that's what we have to do.
I want to help.
Spitter, do you know the most important part of any athletic organization?
morale?
hydration.
you want me to be the water boy?
team hydration facilitator.
remember, it's not what your fraternity can do for you, but what you can't do for your fraternity.
and you just cannot play floor hockey.
it's what you can do for your fraternity.
it's affirmative.
that's the spirit!
aren't as much of a threat as the Lambda Sigs, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't bring our best game.
that is why
I've asked our distinguished alum coach
Roger Owens to help us train.
good luck, coach.
whether it's the rose bowl or intramurals, the story's the same.
a team wins because everyone's on the same page.
a team is only as strong as each individual player.
which is why I'd like to tell you a little bit about my son, pledge Owens.
father Owens, can I talk to you for a second?
trust me, you don't need to hide who you are.
gentlemen, my son has a secret - he needs to share. - No, I don't.
it's okay, Calvin, these walls are sacred.
Calvin's not just an ordinary pledge.
he's... different.
Calvin is...
an all-state hockey player.
you gotta put him on the team!
does it need some glitter?
I was kind of going with a pink and green theme.
something more like...
this.
wait, that's not right.
Hey, little sis, can I have a word?
what's up, big sis?
if you think you can come between Frannie and me...
I feel for you and your sad situation, but Frannie appointed me because she couldn't trust you.
I'm just doing what Frannie feels is the best thing for Zeta Beta.
you didn't even want to come to Zeta Beta in the first place.
but I'm here now, because of you.
ironic, isn't it?
I've spent the past 18 years of my life as the beautiful daughter of my father's political machine.
and I think it's time I start machine of my own.
and who knows, maybe I'll be the youngest president this sorority's ever seen.
beware of the limelight, little sis.
you've got a couple skeletons in your closet.
I'm not leaving, big sis.
and I'm not afraid to play dirty.
man, it must have been tough having your dad as a coach.
it's pretty hardcore.
definitely.
I used to hate when my dad even came to my soccer games.
no matter how well I played, it was never enough.
so I took up cross-country.
meets were so boring, he lost interest.
and I haven't touched a soccer ball since.
so you'll understand if I decide not to play.
no, man. What, are you crazy?
I am putting you on every sports team we have.
until you finish grad school or your knees blow out.
anything for the brothers.
I like your attitude, pledge.
so you're practically a professional hockey player.
why didn't you ever mention it?
you didn't ask.
and, you know, it's not that big of a deal.
Yeah, but you were a jock.
people cheered for you.
no one cheers for you when you solve a Volger-Fulcher-Tamman equation.
except my mom.
last chance to join me for the most fantastic left-behind party ever.
no, thanks.
just sit around and read the books?
we also, you know, interpret science from current events, try to predict the end of days.
and I'll order a delicious pizza.
I'll catch the next one.
the next one may be in heaven, so...
make sure you're on that list.
I've got to live at the Kappa Tau house next semester.
you know, then you can fetch your bros. Water 24/7.
it's only 'cause we're playing against Evan.
otherwise, they would definitely give me a second chance.
you really think so?
this whole brotherhood thing...
I'm not so sure I buy it.
don't I get major girlfriend points for going to see a movie called Hot Rod?
Yeah, 'cause I am definitely in the mood for a comedy.
what?
can we please talk about this?
it's not like you didn't know it was Cappie.
I mean, you knew, right?
Yeah, I knew it was him.
but I didn't know that everyone else on campus knew.
it's not everyone on campus.
I guess one or two Kappa Taus saw me leave the next morning.
you couldn't be a little more discreet?
you hooking up with Rebecca in the middle of a rush party didn't
I'm sorry, Case.
but when I think about you and Cappie, I kind of lose my mind.
I thought all this was behind us.
it was.
until Frannie started doubting my loyalty to Omega Chis, took me off athletic support, and...
brought this whole thing up again.
are you doubting me too?
I'm gonna get some popcorn.
I'll meet you inside.
I thought you wanted to meet for brunch?
what? Coffee, doughnut... brunch.
doesn't matter.
I'm not very hungry anyway.
so what's up with you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Evan and I had the worst date ever last night.
hot Rod... hilarious.
the date with Evan... not so funny.
why, what's going on with you two?
never mind. It's too complicated.
I mean, you make one mistake, and suddenly like, everybody doubts you and forgets everything good and loyal you've ever done.
should I know what that means?
like I said, it's complicated.
fine.
my turn.
I've been benched.
Cappie's not letting me play floor hockey.
which is kind of like a flashback to being ten years old, the worst guy in Little League.
it's not like they're all so perfect.
they're definitely better than I am.
and they have no right to sideline a person based on assumptions.
it's not entirely assumptions.
I did score for the other team.
so why let them set the terms?
Yeah, you're right.
I didn't join a fraternity to be a water-boy.
I joined to be a part of it. - They need proof, give them proof.
get back in the driver's seat.
I gotta go. - Okay.
Thanks. - Don't mention it.
I just wanted to do a little something to thank you for all your team spirit this week.
Tiffany Mesh Bangles.
very impressive, Rebecca.
wait until you see the T-shirts we made.
so cute.
homemade T-shirts.
that is impressive.
Thanks, big sis. - For pledge.
but if you really want to win, you have to be serious.
you have to be willing to play dirty.
right, Becks?
posters and t-shirts?
that's great if this were 1985 and we all had feathered hair.
but I straighten my hair, Rebecca, because I'm serious.
so let's stop playing around.
what are you doing out of your bunker? - I've got a plan that guarantees the Omega Chis win the game.
but it's not going to be easy.
it's going to require that you wear the sexiest, sluttiest, sweetest outfits you own.
Oh, my god, I'm totally in!
did we have physics homework?
no, I'm learning to play hockey.
that won't work.
it has to work. Physics explains everything.
if I don't have the specific skills to play the sport, then my brain can definitely make up for it.
it's an interesting choice of using Drew's co-efficient theory of friction.
Re-normalized with Euclidean quantum field theory.
don't forget to... - I'm on it.
you know, this just might work.
rusty, me, you, we could...
we change the very nature of sports.
we could take back the playgrounds, the fields, the courts, the rinks from the physically gifted.
the future could be ours.
I just want to play intramurals.
today intramurals, but tomorrow...
the world!
if I line up here, taking into account the slant of the incline, the height of the goal, and the rate of my metabolism...
I told you, it's 73 degrees!
this is hopeless! I can't do this!
we should work with the motion capture.
Dale, this is stupid.
there's a reason nobody has taken back the playgrounds.
it's physically impossible.
what if we re-calculated the diameter of the ball in relation to the stick.
no... I'm done.
we can't turn ourselves into athletes.
einstein probably sucked at floor hockey too.
wanna party?
slow down, eager Beaver.
beware of hot greeks bearing gifts.
me thinks we find ourselves confronted by a very attractive Trojan horse.
we invite you in, you get us drunk...
we lose the game tomorrow.
but the Kappa Taus will not succumb to such obvious trickery!
so much for straight hair.
are you seriously...
turning this...
down? Think about it.
I'm doing better than that.
I'm imposing a two-drink limit!
don't use the upstairs bathroom, please.
thank you.
how did you know they couldn't count past two?
we threw booze and girls into the equation.
I just hope I haven't exposed myself to herpes for nothing.
trust me.
I knew you'd come back to me.
we do need to get you some deodorant.
good work, pledge.
he's a great player, so it's your job to make sure he gets extra attention.
hands.
no one's allowed back in the house until they've been disinfected.
this is so much fun!
we have to do this with every house.
we'd wear different themed outfits...
how are we doing in here?
they're on their sixth round of cement mixers.
just to be clear, we're trying to slow them down, not kill them... Ok?
fine.
you've been avoiding me.
Where's Rusty tonight?
not here. We're all alone.
are you gonna let him play?
let's not talk about family.
how about boyfriends?
because I have a boyfriend.
whose ass is gonna be grass tomorrow.
what do you see in that tool anyway?
I happen to like nice guys.
I'm nice guys.
no, you're not.
you're...
drunk.
what happened to you?
I pulled a hammy in practice yesterday.
I think I'm gonna have to sit this one out.
did you go to student health? - There was nothing they could do.
good luck today.
go Omega Chis.
go ahead. I'll meet you at the gym.
what the hell are you doing?
what I wanted to do in the first place.
are you really gonna let your brothers down like this?
you said all I had to do was join your fraternity, and you'd pay for college. Right?
I'm doing your guy thing.
everything else, in my opinion, is non-negotiable.
did you think I wanted you to pledge because it would make you more of a man?
didn't you?
I wanted you to pledge this house because some of the great friendships of my life started here.
my brothers got me through some tough times.
and they helped me get started with my career.
they stood up with me at my wedding.
gays can't get married, remember?
well, what about one of those commitment ceremonies?
or, what are we calling it now, - Civil Union Partnerships? - Dad...
that's not the point all right?
have you...
told anyone here? - No.
son, you have nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed!
I'm great with being gay.
it's just how everyone else reacts that sucks.
when I came out in high school,
I went from being Calvin Owens to "that gay hockey player-guy.
and I'm more than that.
and this is my chance to start fresh, on my own terms.
so I'll tell who I want, when I want. But, to be honest, dad, it's not the most interesting thing about me.
play... Don't play.
that's up to you.
I just don't want you to miss out on what I got from this experience.
some pretty amazing friends.
water boy reporting for duty.
you guys, the game starts in 20 minutes!
Hey, you ok?
muffin.
devil.
so where do you want me, coach?
get out there and show 'em what you got, pledge Owens.
about time, guys.
Dale, what are you doing here?
I'm risking my immortal soul to tell you we forgot to factor in the torque due to residual perspiration, the weight differential of water loss.
which changes, like, everything!
I don't have time for this.
I'm not even playing. - Listen to me!
this is bigger than you.
okay, we started something, and I expect you to finish it.
it wasn't 73 degrees, Rusty, it was 78.
do you hear what I'm saying? It's 78!
we had it all wrong!
take back the gym, Rusty.
for all of us.
Hey, youngblood.
don't you want your good luck kiss?
you must be getting real tired of coming in second to me.
you know what makes it easier?
knowing I'll always be her first.
that was awesome!
who knew sports could be so fun?
definitely.
congratulations, Casey.
your plan was creative, effective, and very dirty.
cheney would be proud.
Thanks.
Calvin is amazing.
and he's kind of hot. Is it just me?
you can get off me now. - Right, that's right.
call me later?
maybe we should call him, Cap.
I'm over here, dude.
maybe we should turn up the towel.
no, you can't give up.
isn't this game bigger than both of us?
isn't this about kickin' ass?
isn't this about good VS Evan?
he's right.
you may not be feeling well.
some of you are even still drunk.
I see before me a team of Kappa Taus, playing in defiance of tyranny.
you've come to fight as free men, and free men you are.
will you fight?
aye, fight and you may die, run and you may live.
at least a while.
it hurts real bad, Cap.
drunk people don't feel pain!
and neither do scotsmen.
we may be puking, the Omega Chis are not used to running on puke like we are!
and Rusty here...
look at him.
just a nice kid from Cleveland.
Chicago.
and I know that when he's dying in his bed many years from now, he'll be willing to trade all his days, from this day, for one chance!
I'm actually fine...
just one chance to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never be able to take our freedom!
if he's dead, do we win automatically?
dude Owens, nice play out there, man.
I can't believe you almost weren't gonna play with us.
I'm kinda regretting missing the first game.
look at that guy. Can't take a hit.
what a freakin' queer.
come on, Beav.
is he dead?
he's still breathing.
I gotta find some adrenaline or something.
so... Are you playing someone else?
I need a decision. Let's go.
we'll play a man down.
what about your water boy?
I bet he wants to play.
you know what?
that's a great idea.
suit up, Spitter.
you're going in.
I can't do this, I'm telling you, I practiced, I studied.
none of it mattered.
I suck! I'm not kidding.
do you know what separates a sucky athlete from a great one?
this.
upper body strength?
your heart.
now grab your stick and be a Kappa Tau.
and Rusty...
if you get the ball...
go that way.
please don't hit it to me.
please don't hit it to him.
Spitter, run!
let the dork go!
equipment penalty for not wearing a cup, which makes us lose the game!
that's just ridiculous.
that's, like, the worst ref ever.
just because you forgot to protect 'em, doesn't mean you don't got 'em.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm sorry I was so blinded by my desire to win,
I completely forgot what being a Kappa Tau is all about.
brotherhood?
drinking and hot chicks.
that was one hell of a shot though.
maybe it was luck.
or chance.
or science. I don't know.
I just know I'm not good at athletics, and I don't have to be.
no, you do not.
now come on, Spitter.
let's get you a drink you can swallow.
barkeep.
Where's Beaver?
Where's Cappie? - Where's my drink?
finally.
pledge Rebecca, can you get the glass?
Thanks.
ladies, just wanted to say thank you for the party favors last night.
most enjoyable.
thank us?
but we sabotaged you.
I can't believe I just said "sabotage."
maybe I am learning French.
well, we would have won, if not for the tragic technicality.
and the cement mixers.
it was a pretty dirty trick.
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it, Case.
sorry, Cappie, we're Omega Chis girls, remember?
Bye!
you know, it's kind of nice when the good guys win, don't you think?
not quite the same when you win 'cause I wasn't wearing a cup.
I'm just saying.
thanks for the athletic support.
can you believe Frannie ever doubted me?
she would have to be crazy, and you know what?
I bet she feels like a jackass for it.
all's forgiven.
there's always rugby in the spring.
I think I'm going into early retirement.
there are certain things you just have to accept about yourself.
I'm good at table sports, and I just suck at hockey.
and I'm gay.
right.
I knew this gay guy once.
well, it wasn't that he was once gay.
I knew him. Once.
and he was gay.
he is gay. - Are you okay?
you're having a little mouth spasm.
I just know that this is a big moment.
and I have no clue what to say.
what are you thinking?
I think I should let you know that I'm okay with it.
which I am.
but then, in my head, I'm just like "way to be presumptuous," Rusty.
I mean, we're friends.
it's not like you need to get my permission to be gay.
we are who we are.
right? - Right.
so does everyone else know but me?
actually, no one here at school knows but you.
are you gonna tell your Omega Chis brothers?
one thing at a time.
I just, I just want to get through pledging first.
it's good to know that I have.
this is the best breakup ever.
she's doing mcdreamy.
Norman is an intern.
I'm your sister.
you're not a girl I ever wanted to have to know because our dad chose you.
my niece's cancer's come back.
she's 17 years old and she's gonna die.
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.
I slept with Izzie.
in life, only one thing is certain...
apart from death and taxes...
no matter how hard you try, no matter how good your intentions, you are going to make mistakes.
you're going to hurt people.
you're going to get hurt.
and if you ever want to recover...
you haven't said anything in...
in...
just say something.
please.
anything.
there's really only one thing you can say.
I forgive you.
what?
you made a mistake.
but we took vows... till death do us part... so...
I forgive you.
Izzie, why aren't you picking up your phone?
you need to pick up your phone.
I just talked to callie and...
I gotta find Izzie.
we have rounds in five minutes. - Right after I find Izzie.
you wanna go away with me this weekend?
why would I want to go away with you?
because of this.
we didn't go away when we were a couple.
now we're not a couple, and not couples have no reason to go away together.
Meredith, you're not paying attention.
I'm talking about 48 uninterrupted hours of this.
where would we go?
wine country.
wine country sounds like a couples' place.
well, there's wine, there's country, and you wouldn't see any of it.
we'd be in bed all weekend.
Oh, a weekend of sex.
now you're paying attention.
well, I would have to get someone to cover for me.
okay, so you're in?
48 uninterrupted hours of this.
I'm in.
Oh, great.
I'm stuck in the pit protecting smackheads and gangbangers with my idiot interns, and you're getting mcdreamied in the elevator?
really, smackheads and gangbangers at seattle grace, huh?
my point is, I hate interns.
well, lexie's not that bad, is she?
Oh, are we not hating her anymore?
Oh, no. We still hate the idea of her.
we just realized we don't have a reason to hate the actual person.
she's an intern.
that's reason enough.
I think you may be the new Nazi.
damn right.
I don't see any charts.
will you work for me on saturday?
what's in it for me?
what do you want?
take norman off my hands today. - Who?
the world's oldest intern.
I've got mynterns in the pit, and he's only gonna slow me down.
ageist.
deal?
fine.
rounds.
still can't find Izzie.
I'm gonna have to put you in the clinic if you miss rounds.
Oh, the clinic!
uh, Ms. Sayles, hi. I'm Dr. Bailey.
Oh, you are?
uh, the boyfriend who warned her not to read on the stairmaster.
that's how I did this.
I fell off last night.
I took a ton of ibuprofen, but when I woke up this morning, it was huge and hideous.
how much ibuprofen did you take?
I usually take some every day anyway, because of the gym, so I doubled the dose, but it did nothing for me.
okay, let's get some x-rays and then...
actually, can I justst get ahot of cortisone or something?
I'm supposed to meet my trainer anoon.
uh, Ms. Sayles, I can't treat you until I find out what's wrong with you.
have you seen Dr. Stevens?
check the pit.
right.
what time do you think we'll be done?
just so I can tell my trainer.
Lexie! Sorry.
uh, have you seen Dr. Stevens? - No.
have you seen Dr. Yang? - No.
she told me to meet her here in the pit, and she's not here.
I don't want to give that woman any more reasons to hate me.
good for you. - I'm prepared.
I'm gonna answer every question correctly.
and I'm not gonna take any more of her crap.
three!
incoming, let's move.
he got hit during a scrimmage.
are you the coach?
he's my dad.
and his coach.
he was charging the receiver after the kickoff.
he got blocked, had his head down, couldn't see the other guy coming.
I had my head down because the guy blocking me was hoing it down.
you could've gotten past that guy.
I need you to leave the room.
okay, let's cut him out of his equipment. I need the saw.
Dr. Grey need you to help me stabilize his neck and his head, please.
it's very important, Adam, that you not move your head.
I need you to keep perfectly still.
don't move.
relax.
O'malley, what's the hur? - Sorry, I can't talk, chief.
I...
sorry, I...
I just gotta find Izzie.
she's at the third floor nurses' station.
Oh. Thanks.
Oh, and...and when you find her, tell her Dr. Torres is looking or her.
now I know charting doesn't seem as exciting as surgery, but it is every bit as important.
believe me when I tell you, people, penmanship saves lives.
pick up your phone.
what kind of doctor doesn't pick up their phone?
is that a 7 or is that a 9?
if I have to ask myself that question in the middle of an emergency, your patient is dead.
you killed him with your handwriting.
think about that.
Hey.
Hi.
we have to talk.
okay. Um, about?
george told me.
he told you? - Everything.
cafeteria, noon, you and me.
be there.
dude, is she gonna kick her ass?
she forgave you?
she said I had a rough year, that people make mistakes, and that...
that I made a mistake. - Oh, so now I'm a mistake?
back off!
no, she said that. I didn't say that.
what did you say?
um, I didn't expect her to forgive me.
I expected...
rage, uh, bloodshed.
no, she's saving all her rage and bloodshed for me.
she's gonna kill me in the cafeteria at lunch. - No, she wouldn't.
she breaks bones for a living, George.
she's crazy.
no, she's not crazy.
well, she is if she thinks I'm not gonna put up a fight.
I can't believe that kid's dad.
I mean, his son is paralyzed, and the guy's still riding him.
focus more on the medicine, three, and less on the tragedy.
three?
is that a nickname?
you could say that.
so how would you proceed, Dr. Grey?
Oh, um...you won't be able to operate unless you realign his spine, would you?
and how would you do that?
traction halo?
very impressive, Dr. Grey.
your intern year's off to a good start.
how's it going?
how are you and Meredith?
it's weird, the whole family thing.
and plus, I think she might still hate me.
she doesn't hate you.
Really? Did she say that?
you know, why don't you go see if mrs. Cooley's dressings need changing?
yang, why don't you go see if mrs. Cooley's dressing needs changing?
certainly.
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Norman Shales.
Oh, Dr. Shales, call me Mark.
thank you.
I thought you were on my service.
I am.
he's my intern.
I know, right?
it's like,"seriously, you're an intern?"
but it's seriously true.
seriously.
glad to have you aboar Norman.
so is he the one you call, uh...
Mcdreamy or, Mc, uh, Sleazy, or Mc, uh, wait a minute, what is it?
Norman, we have labs to deliver. - Yeah.
labs and discharges.
uh, this one's being discharged to hospice?
when there's nothi else we can do.
so we have to tell someone they're dying?
don't worry. I'll teach you the protocol.
Mcsteamy!
he's the one you girls call mcsteamy.
you paged me, Dr. Bailey?
Oh, I didn't know you were...
I'm in the clinic. Or I was...
what have you got?
says she twisted her ankle falling off the stairmaster.
she didn't twist it. She crushed it.
we should book an O.R. Right away.
Dr. Torres, you don't think we should run a few tests first?
find out why ruthie's bones are so fragile in the first place?
she's osteoporotic.
I see it in older women all the time.
now you're seeing it in a 28 year old.
Oh, right.
call me when you get the test results.
I can't talk about it with you.
well, is she all right? - Yeah.
so when giving a patient the bad news, you want to be polite and detached, but not cold.
how can you be detached but not cold?
you show that you care without actually allowing yourself to care, because if you get too emotional, then they get scared, and then they get emotional, and that's bad.
Seriously?
stop with the seriously.
uh, I'm sorry.
I know it must be hard being older than most of us, but I think you're gonna go a lot further if you just let everything else go and focus on the medicine.
Hey, are you aware that mcdreamy and the other grey are bonding? - Bonding?
over their mutual Meredith Greyness.
what do you mean? They're talking about me?
what are they saying? - Oh, I don't know.
he's making me deal with his patients while they focus on what's really important... you.
what was I saying?
you were saying how important it was to focus on the medicine.
just give me the chart.
first we're going to apply halo, which uses weights and traction to pull your spine back into place.
traction?
like at the gym.
we stretch your upper body using weights until the tension pops the spine into position.
except unlike at the gym, dr. Shepherd needs to attach the traction device directly to your head by screwing two bolts into your skull.
that sounds painful.
painful is if he doesn't fix your spine.
painful is you never walk again.
okay.
we gonna do this thing or what?
I told you not to get too emotional.
I couldn't help it.
what now?
go apologize one last time.
once again, ma'am, we are very, very sorry...
very sorry.
and now?
now we slowly and respectfully back out of the room.
Alex, I need a favor.
I don't have time for favors.
I'm working here.
well, what are you doing at lunch?
according to my interns, I'm watching torres kick your ass all up and down the cafeteria.
how do they know?
so it's true.
What'd you do to her?
nothing.
dude.
we need a little help here!
Oh, thank god. Somebody I know.
will somebody please make sure they page my husband?
who is she?
it's the chief's niece.
Camille Travis, 18, I tried intubating 3 times.
there's some kind of obstruction.
my baby can't breathe.
SATs staying down. They're at 82%.
she needs a surgical airway.
somebody get me a crike tray.
how many emergency crikes have you done?
including this one? One.
dude, it's the chief's niece.
pulse is getting weaker.
so we better not screw this up.
what are you doing?
trying to help her breathe.
she just slit her throat!
suction. I need suction.
get the retractors in. - There's so much blood.
you didn hit an artery, did you?
no, not on purpose.
Oh, god. - Oh, god.
get the tube.
Oh, god.
SATs are going up.
Oh, we did it.
what the hell are you doing to my niece?
one thing this childdid not need was another surgery.
she wasn't breathing, chief.
we didn't know what else to do.
you did the right thing.
but Camille was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 14.
she's had both ovaries removed, a hysterectomy and now this...
there it is, the mass.
no wonder she couldn't breathe.
I can take it out.
but we won't know how many more there are until we do further studies.
I'm so sorry, chief.
she beat it twice before.
she'll beat it again.
I just had to tell a 48-year-old woman that she's gonna die.
yeah? I wish I could tell a 24-year-old woman she's gonna die.
I have gone out of my way to be nice to her, and this is what she does, talks about me behind my back?
when were you nice to her?
I was nice...
once.
my point is...
Hey, Meredith.
Hey, Norman.
sup, Lexie?
come on, Norman.
um... Dr. Shepherd asked that we meet in Adam's room in ten minutes.
you could at least acknowledge that you heard me.
you're using the grey sister angle to get in good with the attendings.
I get that.
but you're here on my license.
so if you do anything, like kill someone, it's on me.
so for the rest of the day, you're gonna hug the wall.
you're not gonna say anything, you're not gonna do anything.
you're an intern.
are welear...
three?
what?
it's Lexie, or Grey.
it's not three.
I have a name.
your blood tests show low electrolyte levels, low calcium and low vitamin D.
have you been dieting?
she just lost 40 pounds.
will told me if I ever got back down to a size 4, we'd move in together.
how romantic.
we both just needed motivation.
I told him I wouldn't live with a smoker, so he quit smoking.
the problem is, even if Dr. Torres is able to repair your fracture, it won't do any good unless you're eating more and working out less.
am I right, Dr. Torres?
Dr. Tor...
Hey, are you all right?
uh, uh, Bailey's right.
so what, you're saying that you won't operate unless she puts on a bunch of weight?
no, but, um...
then why are we still talking about this?
we came here to get her leg fixed.
so fix her leg.
okay.
how'd that discharge- to-hospice patient go?
not great.
there was crying and tears and...
more tears.
tears?
Really?
such a tough old bird.
I thought he'd take it like a man.
he'd take it like a man?
what, I'm sexist now?
No,"he" as in "him"?
joel hanson in 2212.
not Gretchen Bitzer in 2213?
Oh, dear.
I thought that "2" was a "3."
Dr. Grey, did you and your intern tell a woman who came in to have her moles removed that she was dying?
Oh, dear.
I mean, crap.
Oh, crap.
you hear that?
like a weight room.
there's nothing to be scared of.
he's been weight training since he was 8 years old.
what did I say about you and the wall?
Dr. Yang, this is still a teaching hospital, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
you need to get a little closer if you want to learn something today, Dr. Grey.
okay, Adam, I'm going to attach the tongs now.
I need you to stay perfectly still during this procedure.
let the weights do all the work.
okay, you're gonna feel a little pressure, but with the meds we've given you, you shouldn't feel any pain.
all right.
here we go.
can you imagine being 14 years old and having some doctor tell you you've got cancer?
what do you do with that?
well, you fight. Camille's a fighter.
you two have that in common.
so what's it gonna be, Stevens gets her bones broken or Torres gets taken to the trailer park?
neither. It's not happening.
but if it does, will you pull her off me?
you gonna tell me what you did to her?
you have to promise not to say anything to anybody.
swear.
I swear.
jeez.
I slept with George.
I know.
I'm a terrible person.
which is why I'm gonna let herget one good punch in.
maybe two.
I deserve it.
no, one. Then you pull her off me.
you slept with O'malley?
Alex, you just said you wouldn't say anything.
I won't, believe me.
this...
I'm embarrassed for you.
you had one job... one job... read the charts.
you want to yell at me some more?
you can, because I am an intern and according to Dr. Bailey, yelling is how we learn.
well, I'm not a very good yeller.
Oh, I'm sure it just takes practice.
perhaps ms. Bitzer will show us how it's done.
just let me do all the talking.
ms. Bitzer...
she left about an hour ago.
she's gone?
left the hospital?
feel like yelling now?
your C.T. results showed that not only is the cancer back, it's spread to your chest, lungs and throat.
we have options, though.
we can operate.
we can be even more aggressive with the chemo and radiation than the last time.
I just want to go home.
we could try to treat you at home, but, camille, you...
no, you don't understand.
I don't want any treatment.
what?
Camille, don't say that.
I've tried, mama.
it not working.
I can't do it anymore.
you can d you will.
you have no choice.
I'm 18 now, aunt adele.
I do have a choice.
you may be 18, baby girl, but you are clearly not capable of making life-and-death decisions for yourself right now.
tell her, Richard.
Camille... - No, you tell her.
tell her how the radiation almost killed me last time, how I got hepatitis and my kidneys shut down and my skin was so raw I couldn'te touched.
Camille... - I'm dying.
we all know that.
I don't want to spend what little time I have left in this hospital.
I want to spend time with my friends.
I want to sleep in my own bed, and I want to be home.
so please don't be my doctor right now.
be my uncle who loves me.
let me go home.
try not to move your head, adam.
I'm... I'm trying, but...
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
you'll take as much as they give you, son.
okay, now come on! You can do this.
it's just another few pounds.
Dr. Yang, maybe we should... - No one asked you.
I - I can't.
please take it off.
no, no. Can't quit.
push through it.
okay, just one more plate.
Adam, you're strong. You can handle this.
want to be a quitter, do you? Huh, do you?
okay, you know what? That's it. That's it.
that's 20 pounds.
there, you did it. Right?
told you you could do it.
somebody get him out. Please. Somebody get him out.
Adam, I'm just trying to help out.
please get out! Get out!
get out! Get out! - Adam, Adam, calm down.
try not to upset him.
Adam. Adam, calm down. - Get... get...
Adam, it's o... it's okay.
what are you doing? Don't touch him.
the slightest movement could...
put his hand down, gently.
I'm so sorry. I forgot.
now step away from the patient and leave the room.
get out right now or I will throw you out.
Dr. Grey, take over for Dr. Yang.
Dr. Yang, a word.
you are a resident now.
your job is to teach interns, not abuse them.
I wasn't. She grabbed his...
until you learn to be less competitive and less selfish, you will not assist on my surgeries.
you will observe them.
but she... - you can go.
Arlene, she's just tired.
she doesn't know what she's saying.
but she's right.
she's not gonna get any better.
we don't know that, Arlene.
there's always a chance.
not if she doesn't get treatment.
you've got to talk to her, Richard.
you've... you have to convince her.
she loves you.
she trusts you.
and she's the closest thing we have to a child of our own.
Richard, I'm begging you.
please.
save our baby girl.
again, Ms. Bitzer, it's very important that you call us back.
you idiots still can't find her?
I called her home, her cell, her next of kin.
I don't care if you have to call every bitzer on the planet.
find her!
I am really so very sorry about this.
it's not entirely your fault, Norman.
you're just an intern.
I should've double-checked the charts.
I was distracted by things I shouldn't be distracted by.
for what it's worth, lexie grey is a good girl.
she's very sweet.
I don't think she would say anything untoward...
or uncool.
I have bitzers to call.
but, you know, you could take the...
I'm not a bad resident, am I?
don't ask me. I lost a patient today.
Oh, you killed someone?
lost. Literally can't find.
shepherd says I'm selfish and competitive.
what the hell is wrong with that?
I kick ass. I'm an excellent resident.
I'm not.
in addition to losing my patient, I also lost my intern.
turned around, he was gone. Awol.
see, what... what is wrong with these interns?
we weren't like this.
we were great interns.
I was great.
you were... you were good.
you guys seen Callie? - No.
is it time for herto grind your bones into dust?
you don't think I can take her?
are you guys really doing this? - You heard?
the whole hospital heard.
Yeah, well, that explainsthe line at the salad bar.
well, what are you fighting about?
believe me, you don't want to know.
I'm just saying, whatever it is, it's not worth it.
actually, it is.
some things are worth fighting for.
picking up repeat labs for Ruthie Sayles.
so who's your money on, O'malley? Guess you gotta back the wife, huh?
what? What are you talking about?
the fight downstairs. Torres VS. Stevens.
what are they fighting about anyway?
Oh, Maile, that's just a rumor.
it's not happening.
Callie is way too mature for that.
that's not what my buddy in the cafeteria just said.
O'malley, your labs! - Gotta go! I'll be right back!
I'm just saying, I learned how to fight in a trailer park. Okay?
Where'd she learn to fight, boarding school? Not quite the same thing.
I'm a street fighter.
I've got some badass in me.
I could take a girl down.
punch with your left. Protect your face with your right.
no, your hands... protect your surgeon hands.
your face can heal.
here we go.
let's do this.
let's go.
let's go.
go where? - You know, go.
I wanted to talk.
you want to talk. You don't want to kick my ass?
you thought I was gonna fight you? You...
that's cr...
excuse me.
that's a forfeit. Torres forfeits.
Oh, my god.
you were very ghetto fabulous.
Oh, my god.
what happened? Was there a fight?
no.
guess they realized they were fighting over nothing.
Hey, what do you think's a better weekend getaway, Napa or Sonoma?
I hope you don't mind if I kill your girlfriend.
well, first of all, she's not my girlfriend.
second of all, I do mind.
interns should be seen and not heard.
they shouldn't talk to patients.
that's how they learn.
which means I have to teach, and then I have to deal with their problems when they screw up.
Meredith rarely screws up, and she's not an intern.
so Napa or Sonoma, what do you think?
Sonoma. - Mm.
smaller hotels, fewer tourists.
she's still an intern. Don't kid yourself.
she's green, she's a baby, and the only difference between her and that old guy she's got trailing her is that you're not sleeping with the old guy.
sorry I'm late.
well, I was just explaining the surgery.
since your bones have splintered, Dr. Torres will place metal plates and screws to hold the ankle together.
how long will the recovery time be?
it's hard to say.
you'll be in a cast 8 to 12 weeks.
three months?
right, Dr. Torres?
longer if she doesn't eat.
she eats.
not enough to keep her bones from snapping, but you don't seem too concerned about that.
what is your problem, lady? - I don't have paroblem.
I'm not the one who has to live with you. - You know what?
this... you have a problem... - Ruthie!
in her go ahead.
in here.
I thought ruthie wasn't going into surgery till tomorrow.
that's before she started vomiting blood.
she's got a bleeding duodenal ulcer.
how did we not see this?
she came in with a broken ankle.
her malnutrition and the amount of ibuprofen she's been taking, she's lucky to be alive.
why did she do this to herself?
cause people are stupid and just want to be loved.
that's the only reason anybody does anything.
asystole.
OK, start C.P.R.
you think he'll walk again?
it's not impossible.
Mm. We have a bleeder.
I need you to cauterize the vein, Dr. Grey.
Oh, okay.
I...
I, um...
I - I can't find it.
I - I - I can't see where it starts. Um...
it's coming too quickly.
stop. Suction around it.
you have to see where the bleed is coming from first.
follow the flow to the source. Good.
okay, now bovie it.
got it.
good job.
Dr. Yang, if you don't mind stepping in?
Dr. Grey.
Norman, where haveou been?
I was... - Norman, do you think you can just cut out on me in the middle of a crisis?
I - I went... - Where, Norman?
where did you go that was important enough to just disappear in the middle of a shift?
ms. Bitzer's apartment. - You went to ms. Bitzer's apartment.
I told her she had a bill outstanding.
she's right behind me. - Oh.
Oh, but if I may say so, your yelling has improved remarkably.
thank you.
I - I'm sorry I missed your calls.
I didn't mean to cut out on my bill.
it's just, I got a lot of living to do and not a lot of time to do it in.
actually... - I quit my job, dumped my loser boyfriend, told my boss where he could shove it, and bought a one-way ticket to iceland, where the sun never sets, which is fine by me.
I'll sleep when I'm dead, right?
you're, uh, not going to die, Ms. Bitzer.
I'm not? - There was a mix-up with your labs.
you're going to live, hopefully a very long, healthy life.
I quit my job.
I broke up with my boyfriend.
I gave up my apartment.
you know how hard it is to find an apartment...
with parking?
I thought you quit smoking.
wasn't that the deal?
Ruthie loses 40 pounds, you quit smoking?
my girlfriend's in emergency surgery.
I think she'll forgive me for smoking.
no, no, she won't, because she's dead.
Ruthie's dead.
Dr. Bailey tried to stop the bleeding, but because she was starving herself and over training, her heart couldn't take the strain.
you think this is my fault?
she wanted to lose the weight.
I just wanted herto be healthy.
she was healthy 20 pounds ago.
you just wanted her to be hot, - especially if you we gonna move in with her, right? - No, that...
I loved her. - You didn't love her.
you just didn't want to be alone or maybe maybe she was good for your ego or...
or maybe she made you feel better about your miserable life, but you didn't love her because you don't destroy the person that you love!
callie! - Get her away from me, man.
get her away from me. - You gonna hit me? You gonna hit me?
give me any excuse to kick somebody's ass today - because I am dying to! - Don't touch me!
Dr. Torres!
uh, sir, we are so sorry for your loss.
O'malley, please take... - Sir, why don't you come with me?
come on.
okay, I'm gonna ask you one last time, are you all right?
I'm fine. It's nothing.
Really?
cause nothing almost cost you your career just now.
the mass we removed from your throat was so big you couldn't breathe.
what took you so long to come in?
I knew the cancer wasn't gone.
it's never been gone.
it's never gonna be gone.
and...
don't tell my mom, but the truth is...
I was hoping it would kill me before I had to come back here.
I'm just so tired, uncle Richard.
I am so, so tired.
what I have here is a plan to keep you alive.
it involves 12 oncologists, 8 new drugs, six experimental treatments from three different continents.
I have no idea if it'll work.
but as your uncle...
I'm begging you to take it.
because I know for a fact the world...
my world...
is a better place with you in it.
however... as your doctor,
I promise to do whatever you want.
I just want to go home.
then let's get you home.
Callie, wait. Please, wait.
please.
I'm sorry... about the cafeteria.
I didn't know that you wanted to talk to me.
I thought you wanted to kill me.
I'm sorry about everything.
with George, I...
I'm really sorry.
I feel terrible.
you feel terrible?
you took advantage. He was your best friend. I tried to trust you...
so much, I had convinced myself that it was all in my head, that I was crazy.
but I wasn't, was I?
and then you pull that thing in the cafeteria today?
it's not bad enough that you humiliate me by getting in bed with my husband.
you have to humiliate me at work, too.
george might be the one that broke his vows, but you...
we're women, Izzie. You did this to another woman.
you...
took something from me.
you stole something from me like a petty little thief.
you are the one who should be humiliated.
you are the one who should be ashamed.
you are the one who should...
don't you dare come to me for forgiveness, you traitorous bitch.
what, I'm invisible now?
what do you want?
so you hate me now, too.
well, join the club.
you and O'malley?
O'Malley! - What?
what is it that I did that is so horrifying?
I fell in love, Alex.
he's married. - Yeah, so?
you're carrying a big ol' torch for Ava or Jane Doe or whatever it is that you call her, and she's married.
so what gives you the right to judge what I do?
why do you even care?
you told me you weren't ready yet...
after Denny... to be with anyone.
and then O'malley? O'malley.
and then you tell me like I'm one of your chick friends.
come on.
ms. Bitzer, I just wanted to apologize one more time.
Oh, and I just wanted to say thank you, Dr. Grey.
and, you, too, Dr. Shales. Bless you.
Bye-bye.
she's not going to sue? - Nope.
our lawyer talked her into settling.
Seattle grace just bought that woman four bedrooms - I'm so sorry. - Well, don't tell me.
tell the chief. I'm writing you both up.
it wasn't Norman's fault. He's my responsibility.
I'm the resident. I'm the only one you should write up.
that's very noble of you, Dr. Grey.
stupid...
but noble.
Oh.
for the record, Dr. Grey, I don't think you're stupid at all.
I find you...
quite smart.
what did you say to Camille?
Adele... I've already lost one baby.
and now I have to lose Camille?
I am not going to use Camille to try and make up for the fact that I never gave you children.
I never asked you to.
I asked you to talk to her, to convince her to...
I can't do that...
I can't do that, Adele.
I can give her all the options in the world, but I cannot make her do what I want her to do.
I'm her doctor.
I thought being a doctor was about saving lives.
after all these years of choosing your job over your family, the one time I ask you to do your job to save this family...
Adele, I'm sorry.
I'm truly, truly sorry, but...
so am I, Richard.
you can't...
just forgive me.
what I did to you...
I - Is unforgivable.
that's how it works. That's what "I forgive you" means.
no, see, I...
I think it means you don't forgive me. I...
you don't know how to talk to me right now.
I mean, look, you don't...you can't even look at me.
you're so angry that...
I think the only way you can deal with me is to say you forgive me and...
what, we pretend it didn't happen?
I...
it happened.
and you don't forgive me.
you're right.
I don't.
so I got alex to cover for me. - Oh.
so I can leave right after I round on my patients. - Yeah.
48 uninterrupted hours... - Yeah, yeah. Um...
you know what? Maybe this is not a good weekend.
what did Lexie say about me?
she didn't say anything. I did all the talking.
look, don't blame her.
so what, you're friends with my sister now?
I mean, you talk to the other Grey about me?
Mm-hmm.
you know what I talked about with the other Grey?
all the things this grey won't let me say.
you can say anything to me.
I want to marry you.
I want to have kids with you.
I want to build us a house.
I want to settle down and grow old with you.
I want to die when I'm 110 years old in your arms.
I don't want 48 uninterrupted hours.
I want a lifetime.
Mm-hmm.
do you see what happens?
I say things like that, and you fight the urge to run in the opposite direction.
it's okay.
I understand.
I didn't, but now I do. I do.
you're just getting started
and I've been doing this for a long time.
deep down...
you're still an intern.
and you're not ready.
I'm not ready right now.
but things could stay the way they are...
and I can get ready. I'll get ready.
things can stay the way they are.
we can still meet in the elevator or the on call room.
and maybe you'll be ready.
and I'll wait.
I'll wait until you're ready.
okay, then.
Yeah, but what if...
what if while I'm waiting I meet someone who is ready to give me what I want from you?
what if you do?
I don't know.
forgive and forget.
that's what they say.
I just wanted to say, um, thank you for...
saving my ass today in surgery.
well, that's my job, three.
now where are adam's post-op labs?
it's good advice, but it's not very practical.
I'll get them, Dr. Yang.
when someone hurts us...
we want to hurt them back.
come in.
keep it down, will you?
when someone wrongs us, we want to be right.
without forgiveness, old scores are never settled...
old wounds never heal.
and the most we can hope for is that one day we'll be lucky enough to forget.
you never know the biggest day of your life
is going to be the biggest.
the days you think are going to be big ones...
they're never as big
as you make them out to be in your head.
it's... the regular days...
the ones that...
start out normal...
those are the days that end up being the biggest.
and today was the wedding.
it was beautiful... Perfect.
just a normal day.
a normal day.
we're going to work.
just a normal day that ends in a ceremony in a churchy church.
this has nothing to do with us.
we're just the bride and groom.
we're getting married tonight.
we're getting married tonight.
you slept here?
I'm awake, what?
you slept here? I slept here.
uh, how? wait, who, what?
I slept in the on-call room.
Oh.
I could've been at home in my own bed.
sorry.
now I have to work all day,
and then I have to be happy maid of honor
and get Meredith down the aisle.
I'm so tired... because I slept here,
because you wanted to get your freak on with roller skate girl.
I am sorry.
I was gonna, but...
we went to dinner and... things didn't...
I wasn't in the mood.
I had to be here early anyway to run the E. R. so...
Oh, you're--you're picking up extra shifts in the ER.
so is, uh, is Owen not here today?
Oh, he's here. oh, crap. I'm late.
big day. biggest day of your life.
don't do that. Don't do the peppy maid of honor thing.
it's creepy.
Really? Good.
wait, is this, like, the calm before the storm?
do you need me to drug you
or shave off your eyebrows to numb you into submiss.
no I am fine.
it's not the biggest day of my life.
it's the biggest day of Izzie's life.
I'm excited about the marriage, not some wedding.
anyway, she's the one who's gone all bridezilla.
bridezilla.
you should see the bridesmaids' dresses.
the flowers. They are gonne being deliever here at 5.
I had to pay extra for them to decorate the church,
but Derek gave me his credit card,
told me to do what I had to do,
so... it's gonna be perfect.
how's her blood pressure? - Within normal limits.
and her incision site?
uh, as we expected two week after the surgey.
well, she just got off I. L.-2. 38 hours ago.
I mean she could still have
her mets is gone, her blood pressure is fine
her incision doesn't hurt.
she's doing well.
it's wedding day, and I am going to the wedding.
I'm a bridesmaid. I'm going. right, Bailey?
I said you could go.
wedding day! up top, Alex.
I'll check on you later.
come on. don't leave me hanging, bailey.
wedding day.
wedding day.
you just did that 'cause I have cancer.
you didn't mean it. - True.
my hair is starting to fall out.
you still look good.
I know what this means,
you being here.
I'm sorry.
I'm still going to the wedding.
how's Izzie?
good. - Is her B. P. stable?
if she's hypotensive, she really shouldn't go to the wedding.
you let me worry about Izzie. -All right.
all right. Do you have anything for us? Anything good?
Nope, it's slow.
you don't say it's a slow day in the pit.
you never say it's slow. You just jinxed us.
it's a day and it's slow.
when that phone starts ring and gets trauma
you're gonna wish you hadn't said that.
that phone never get ring.
it's a slow day.
go for Seattle grace emergency.
I'll get the trauma gowns. - Crap, crap. Incoming!
how's it going with your shrink?
um, I'm doing better...
inch by inch.
progress is... slow.
it was your ceiling fan, above your bed
the blades spinning like the blades of a chopper.
um, my shrink said that was the trigger to me
choking you.
Oh.
you know, we should probably get going.
david Simons, 22. he was in the driver's seat.
his car got crushed by a semi truck blew a tire
and jackknifed across four lanes of traffic.
okay, take him to bay one until the trauma ready.

Becca Wells-- respiratory rate of 20,
but otherwise, vital signs are stable.

he's--he's the first person in his family to go to college.
don't worry about your friends right now.
we'll take good care of 'em. No hemothorax or pneumothorax.
in line for c. t. - We're gonna do a few x-rays,
get a better idea of what's going on with you.
your body's in some serious shock
I have a speech to give.
I have I'm supposed to... I'm valedictorian.
all I've ever done is school.
it's all I've ever done.
I haven't done anything else...
U-until today.
today's the day that my life is supposed to start,
which is why I'd really like to live, okay?
let me know the results of the c. t. okay.
I haven't seen Dana yet-- my girlfriend.
she was in the backseat next to Michelle
hang blood and push fluids.
she was singing to the radio.
she never knows the words to anything.
I turned around to tell her the words and then...
she wasn't there anymore.
we need you to calm down so we can tread you
you have very serious injuries.
she was not in the car any more.
I promise I will check for you as soon as I can,
but you need to stay still for me.
she's wearing a pink sweater.
okay. - Keep working.
try to get his pressure up before you move him anywhere.
systolic and stabilizing,
but he's still having multiple arrhythmias.
I'm thinking cardiac contusion.
I'm about to do chest too.
you've got this, O'malley.
I've got blood. - Put it in the rapid infuser.
are my friends here? Did you see Pete?
which one's Pete?
he's wearing red sneakers.
and Michelle--she dyed her hair blue for graduation.
did you see her? Is she okay?
Um,I-I'll find 'em.
my whole family's coming.
I know. It's a big day.
for them. Today is for them.
v-fib. He's coding. Get the paddles.
you paged me?
Yes. did you get the check for the caterers - And the cash tips for the waiters? - Yes.
uh, did you write your vows?
not yet. I will. - Derek... you have to write your vows.
what you say to Meredith on this day, it's important.
she'll remember it for the rest of her life.
Izzie,
so if you paged me to talk about the wedding,
I-- that's not why I paged you.
I have a craniotomy to get to.
he's back.
Denny--he's back.
I'll page Dr. Bailey, and we'll order
order an M. R.I. I know the drill.
you wanted to see me, chief?
Derek was supposed to do this,
but he got pulled into something, - So I said I'd give it to you. -What?
your wedding present. not from me. it's from Derek.
but I have to oversee it.
I was supposed to get my present? - Meredith, it's
this is why weddings are so stupid.
I mean, our life together should be the present,
not some stupid--anyway, whatever it is, chief,
I don't want it.
so tell Derek to take it back. Well, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him to take it back. - He got you a colon.
what? - A colon. It's nonrefundable, it's inflamed,
it's about to go under anesthesia in O.R. two.
you really want to say you don't want it?
a solo surgery?
happy wedding day, Meredith.
yes or no? Hey.
I don't need a maybe. I need a yes or a no.
Oh, okay. I'll be right here waiting.
you think Shepherd and Grey are gonna last?
like, uh, 50 years last?
a semi crashed into a bunch of college kids
on the day that I decided to take an extra shift in the E.R.
Oh! Great. Thank you.
there's burns, digit amputations,
nasty, nasty facial lacerations, - So please don't go anywhere, okay? - Relax.
you promise? - You're handling this.
I am handling-- hey! You-- you can't put him here.
I've got doctors who need access.
what went wrong last night?
uh, I'm kinda busy here, Arizona.
I have four surgeries back to back
and a kid on life support-- I'm kinda busy, too.
what went wrong? - Hey, that's not any better.
put him in the hall.
we went out to a four-star restaurant, best in Seattle.
it was supposed to be fun, romantic,
but then you ordered a salad when they make
the most delicious French food,
and then you picked at it, barely spoke to me, then bolted.
so what went wrong? I mean, did-- did I do something?
I just wasn't feeling it. I was exhausted, tired.
sorry. Hey! I said the hall.
the hall.
fill me in, O'malley.
I put in the first chest tube, but there's no blood.
tried another one, but there's no pulse.
how long has it been though 20 minutes. Should I open his chest?
he's gone, O'malley. Move on.
he's supposed to graduate. To see him graduate.
O'malley, let it go. He is gone. You can't save him.
you move on to save the people you can. mm-hmm.
we have more trauma coming in. O'malley, now. move.
call it, Grey.
time of death, 9: 24.
it could be anything.
it could be scar tissue, okay?
we just wait and see - It's tumor. - You don't know that.
Denny Duquette is standing right behind you.
it's a tumor. Right, Denny?
Yeah.
it's good to see you, Dr. Bailey.
you can't see him because you don't have a tumor,
but he says hi.
tell Denny Duquette I said go home.
it's a tumor.
wait and see.
I'm sorry. I'm crying more than usual.
you said I'm in shock. Is that it?
Yeah. It's also the morphine.
I should've slept with David.
I thought about it,
but he was... sweet and--and funny and...
I would've fallen in love with him.
and I didn't want a relationship till after school. I...
I don't like to do things... halfway.
I was doing school, and then I was gonna do life.
and now... now David's dead. David's dead.
how was the c. t. Karev?
her stomach is herniating into her left hemithorax
from a huge lac in her diaphragm.
okay. Becca, we're taking you to surgery soon.
I should've...
I should've had sex with David when I had the chance.
Dana... Is she okay?
the paramedics haven't brought her in yet,
but as soon as they do, I'll let you know.
do you have any, uh, family we can contact?
they're in Argentina.
I'm supposed to fly there tomorrow.
it's d-day.
it's what?
that's what Dana calls it.
my parents don't have the money to let me stay.
I have to go back.
we both knew d-day was coming.
I tried to break up with her to make it easier.
I'd switch classes every semester
so that we didn't have any together.
but it didn't matter.
I couldn't stay away.
when you love someone, you know, love is love.
it doesn't matter that you're not supposed to be together.
how's he doing?
uh, he's starting to stabilize.
good. Looks like he's ready for c. t.
I think... maybe she got out in time.
maybe she's not hurt that bad.
because when I turned around...
she wasn't there.
she was not there anymore.
okay, x-ray is really backed up, - But... hey, that-- that's Pete. - What?
David's friend--Pete. The--the red sneakers.
could you get over here and help me?
he's bleeding through the dressing on the chest wound.
pulse is 220.
pericardial effusion.
get me a syringe and a spinal needle.
here you go.
I'm going in through the wound.
okay, I'm gonna need another syringe, now.
there's too much blood. - Okay, just keep the syringes coming.
give me a 60cc this time.
asystole. He's flatlining.
uh, get the cardio board. there. Just...
keep holding pressure.
okay, I'm starting compressions on my count. One two three.
George.
just keeping putting pressure. I am not losing another one.
thank you.
you're scrubbing in? I thought I was doing this solo.
Oh, you are. - Then why aren't you sitting in a corner reading a magazine?
Oh, this is a big day, Meredith.
I'm just taking precautions, that's all.
afraid I'm gonna kill the patient on my wedding day?
it's a routine colectomy. I'm not gonna kill him.
I-I know. You're gonna do great.
pretend I'm not even here. - Okay.
okay, Boki... scalpel.
Oh, great. Very nice.
what?
the way you asked for the scalpel.
you didn't mumble. You took charge right off the bat.
loud and clear--"scalpel'.
it was good. Very impressive.
great.
I'm gonna get started now,
Oh, of--of course.
you won't even know I'm here.
Thanks. Maybe I'll toast to the fact
that they love each other.
it doesn't bring up the future.
it doesn't talk about whether they'll make it.
it's good, right? mm-hmm.
you said you were tired, exhausted,
but you can't be that exhausted if you're working - in E.R. on your day off. - I rallied.
you rallied? - Yeah.
you're lying. - No, I'm not lying. I love the E.R.
can you hold, please? Thanks.
you love the E.R.? - Mm-hmm. Can't get enough of it.
it's fun.
you should tell her.
Yeah. suck it, Mark.
Hey, we need more blood in trauma two. Go.
Dr. Hunt. - What?
I just lost another one. All my patients are dying.
I need you to help me.
that's not for me to decide. The ambulance is coming in.
go see what you can do. - I'm in over my head.
walk away, O'malley.
that's Michelle. she dyed her hair for graduation.
look.
I'm looking, but I don't see anything.
because there's nothing there.
the scan's clean. - I told you.
then why is Denny back? The man's a hallucination.
that means there has to be something there.
look, Izzie, i-if it's clear, then...
I want to go to this wedding.
I want to watch the bride walk down the aisle.
I want to hear the vows. I want to catch the bouquet.
I planned this wedding down to the very last detail.
it's the perfect wedding.
this wedding... is perfect.
you know how much I want to be there.
so why would I tell you about Denny,
today of all days? Why wouldn't I just wait?
Denny is back.
that means something is there.
well, it's not like we can just...
map the brain for hallucinations the way we do a seizure.
wait a minute. What are hallucinations?
hallucinations are neurons firing in the brain.
exactly.
Why?
well, it's never been done before,
but if we can somehow induce your hallucination,
there's a chance that we could pick it up on an E.E.G.
then we could pinpoint the part of the brain.
that's hallucinating.
uh, trauma one's open.
what do we have?
she had a pulse in the field,
but we haven't been able to get one now for over 30 minutes.
I'm pretty sure we left half her blood volume
on the side of the road.
she's D.O.A. man. I just need you to call it.
Oh, god oh my god
crap. a pink sweater. that's Jordan's girlfriend.
um, move her out of here.
I need you to call it.
time of death Dana! Dana, no!
Dana, no, no, I need to see her!
someone help me, time to death 10: 45.
he's coding. get a crash cart.
no. no, no, no.
we are closed to trauma.
because we have trauma coming out of our butts.
Oh, well, you have a nice day, too.
Oh, for the love of-- so the E.R. is fun, but I'm not?
Arizona
you can't get enough of me?
is that what you're saying
I mean, do you just want to just end this?
Because--because there are women that are lining up for me.
I'm hot, and if you want out, then you should just
have the guts to say so. I can take it.
maybe this was just a fling that's run its course, okay?
maybe it's over.
maybe it is.
I got some adhesions.
I need to dissect down to mobilize the sigmoid.
Bovie, please.
do you have something you'd like to say?
Oh, no, no. you're-- you're doing fine.
how's the solo surgery coming along, Grey?
well, I think it's going okay,
but you should probably ask the chief here.
well... she's doing great.
she chose a cautery when, at one point,
I probably would've gone with scissors,
but she made it work.
we'll be out of here In plenty of time for the wedding.
good. then she won't be excuses
excuse me?
this is the second I've been Derek's best friend
I have to come up with a toast,
offer some words of wisdom-- it's a lot of work.
I don't want to have to be his best man a third time If you know what I mean.
so you came in here to threaten me?
I'm his best man. that's my job.
what now?
Oh, no. it's okay. it's fine.
everything-- everything's fine, right?
I-I don't need to say anything.
so... now what?
I just try to have a hallucination?
Yep. okay.
Stevens, is it always Denny?
I mean, no one else?
Yeah.
what?
Oh, no, nothing.
it makes sense. it's the man you love.
he's not the man I love.
he's not?
well, I mean, I...I love Denny.
I will always love Denny. he means a lot to me. I...
but I think I hallucinate denny.
because I associate him with death and dying.
when I think about my future-- who I am now,
who I want to be, how I want to spend the rest of my life,
when you get that flutter in your chest,
Alex. Alex is the man I love.
Karev.
I love Alex Karev.
so... let's find this tumor and get it out of me
so that we can have our perfect wedding
a wedding not wasted on two people
who don't appreciate weddings.
I can hear you.
I know you can hear me.
I mean for you hear me
what if I can't make him appear?
we'll wait until
well, you have to be at the church in two hours.
it could take more than two hours.
I'll be late.
no. no, no being late.
I'll make him appear. I can do this.
come on, Denny.
h-how are my friends doing?
just tell me.
I can take it.
I mean, I can't, but I can.
did someone else die?
why don't you tell me your speech?
your graduation speech.
I can take it.
Becca, just... just give me your speech.
you worked hard on it.
you should do it right now.
come on.
today is the day my life begins.
today...
I become a citizen of the world.
today I become a grown-up.
today I become accountable
to someone other than myself and my parents...
accountable for more than my grades.
today I become accountable to the world...
to the future...
to all the possibilities that life has to offer.
starting today...
come on, Denny. come on.
my job is to show up...
Wide-eyed...
and willing
and ready.
for what?
I don't know.
for anything...
for everything...
damn it. charge to 360.
to take on life...
nice job, Meredith.
to take on love...
all the times I didn't ask for you, and you were here.
now I'm asking. Please.
please come to me now.
please help me now. come on.
come on, Denny. just--you come to me now.
Denny.
to take on...
the responsibility and possibility.
today, my friends, are lives begin.
time of death--1302.
and I, for one...
Denny.
Denny!
there.
can't wait.
I'm here for you, Izzie.
it's right there.
these the results of the Tesla M.R.I.?
Yeah. you know that part of the brain
that reacted during the hallucination
it was the other temporal lobe.
that...
that's the tumor?
Yeah. tiny.
too small to pick up on a normal M.R.I.
but... o-okay, if it's that small,
how are you gonna get to it?
I wish there was something I could do for her.
I wishI could...
I like Stevens.
she's one of the good ones.
I wish there was something I could do for her.
I, um...
I know something you can do.
I just want you to know that I'm hurt.
I am hurt and I am angry,
because I thought that we had something.
I thought that we were going somewhere.
if you're just sleeping around,
if you're just making the rounds of girl surgeons,
then I think that you ought to know that I-- we went to a fancy resturant
what?
we went to a fancy restaurant,
the nicest restaurant in Seattle.
the salad that I ordered-- the salad--cost $26. 95.
the wine that you ordered cost $125 a bottle.
I didn't even look at the entrees
because Ii knew I wasn't gonna be able to order one
because I was already out 75 bucks,
and I don't even like salad. oh.
and then the bill came, and you
I...I paid.
do you know what I was doing
before they brought over the check?
I was counting in my head trying to figure out
how I was gonna buy food for the rest of the week
if my half was 75 bucks...
because I don't have 75 bucks
because my father disowned me
and has cleared out my bank account.
I am broke.
Callie...
and I am exhausted, Arizona.
I'm working in the E.R. because I need the money.
six people died on my watch today,
and I am fried.
I wanted to stay in last night.
I thought... I thought that last night
would be the night for us,
you know, our night.
but you wanted to go to a fancy restaurant,
and I...I can't do that.
I can't.
Hey, it's okay. it's okay. hey.
so... we stay in.
and we'll eat...
sandwiches.
you don't even like sandwiches.
but I like the girl who has the sandwiches.
okay?
okay.
no, you know what?
I don't like sandwiches either. I like pizza.
I like pizza, too.
Meredith.
Yes, sir.
I've been reading your mother's journals.
I wish she was here today.
well, I don't know how she would've felt about me getting married.
no, not for that. for this...
your first solo surgery.
Oh, well, she probably would've said,
with all the mistakes I've made,
I'm lucky the patient's alive.
Yeah, that's right.
but I also know that she would've been thrilled.
she wouldn't have been able to tell you,
but she would've been.
thank you, sir.
Hey. you-- best wedding present ever.
and you know why?
no.
because now I have to go home
and put on a corset and pantyhose and a petticoat
and look like one of those idiots
on top of a wedding cake,
and then I have to walk down the aisle
and have everyone staring at me.
but it's okay, because I got to cut someone open today from start to finish.
I saved a life.
what?
what do you say we make this day even better?
good work today, O'malley.
good work?
they're dead. All those kids are dead. - not all of them.
no, the one I didn't touch is just fine.
Yeah, because I was able to get to her.
and the reason I was-- the only reason
is because I had you on my team.
you saved that girl today as much as I did.
trauma's a team sport, O'malley.
you don't have to be the hero. you just...
you just have to go where you're needed.
Alex...
Bailey says Shepherd found another tumor in Izzie's brain.
did you hear?
I heard. - I just
Alex-- - he doesn't think he's gonna get it out this time.
I think...
I think she's gonna die on me.
I think she's really gonna die.
Oh! what are you doing here?
aren't you supposed to be getting ready for a wedding?
well, that's what I came to talk to you about.
Hi. I'm Dr. Grey.
I'm gonna take care of your central line.
okay.
you're crying.
you're breathing.
my shoes are, uh, in the closet there.
Bailey? - um, shoes, right.
you're supposed to be helping me... get ready.
I can still go, right?
I mean, the tumor's not going anywhere, so...
Yeah, you can go.
okay, well...
we don't want to be late.
Bailey-- - hey, oh, uh, here she comes.
mer! you're supposed to be at the church.
I'm going. I just came to say, this isn't my dress.
of course it's your dress. It's perfect.
it... what are you talking about?
no, this dress is not for me.
I don't... what?
Oh, god.
I knew you were gonna freak out before the wedding.
mer... Derek loves you. Marriage is good.
tell her it's good.
no, she's saying... it's not her wedding dress.
she's right.
the dress isn't for Meredith.
Oh, Mer.
I don't...
I-I don't even know how to...
I...
thank you.
okay.
so who's the maid of honor, me or Cristina?
Cristina.
Alex--he needs a best man,
and he was asking for you, so...
Oh, so what, I'm-- I'm leftovers?
you tried to save my life.
that makes you honorable.
take my hand.
dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to celebrate the wedding
of Alexander Michael Karev
and Isobel Catherine Stevens.
this is a sacred rite,
an ancient rite.
as Isobel and Alex prepare to join their lives,
it is important to understand that everyone present
has played a part in shaping their lives
and will continue to play a vital role in their continuing future.
and thus, we are here not only to witness their vows to each other,
but to bestow upon them our blessing.
and now the couple will read their vows.
uh, we didn't write anything.
no, wait. I have something I want to say.
today's the day my life begins.
all my life, I've been just me
just a smart-mouth kid.
today I become a man.
today I become a husband.
today I become accountable to someone other than myself.
today I become accountable to you,
to our future,
to all the possibilities that our marriage has to offer.
together, no matter what happens,
I'll be ready...
for anything...
for everything...
to take on life,
to take on love,
to take on possibility and responsibility.
today, Izzie Stevens, our life together begins.
and I, for one, can't wait.
I love you.
not yet. - hurry up.
by the power vested in me by god and the state of Washington,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
now?
now.
you never know the biggest day of your life
is the biggest day...
not until it's happening.
Hey. hey, it's okay.
it's just hair. you don't need it.
it's just gonna keep falling out.
we'll shave it off.
I bet you look good bald anyway.
okay?
stop.
you're beautiful.
you don't recognize the biggest day of your life,
not until you're right in the middle of it.
the day you commit to something or...
someone...
the day you get your heart broken...
best non-wedding day ever.
want to go again?
the day you meet your soul mate...
the day you realize...
there's not enough time...
because you want to live forever...
those are the biggest days...
the perfect days...
you know?
I bet you made a beautiful bride.
it was a beautiful day.
you put the scarf on.
I told you, you don't need it.
you look gorgeous without it.
he's right.
go away now.
go away.
I want to be alone...
with my husband.
my wife is hot.
this is the best breakup ever.
she's doing mcdreamy.
Norman is an intern.
I'm your sister.
you're not a girl I ever wanted to have to know because our dad chose you.
my niece's cancer's come back.
she's 17 years old and she's gonna die.
Alex, I'm sorry. I can't.
I slept with Izzie.
in life, only one thing is certain...
apart from death and taxes...
no matter how hard you try, no matter how good your intentions, you are going to make mistakes.
you're going to hurt people.
you're going to get hurt.
and if you ever want to recover...
you haven't said anything in...
in...
just say something.
please.
anything.
there's really only one thing you can say.
I forgive you.
what?
you made a mistake.
but we took vows... till death do us part... so...
I forgive you.
Izzie, why aren't you picking up your phone?
you need to pick up your phone.
I just talked to Callie and...
I gotta find Izzie.
we have rounds in five minutes. - Right after I find Izzie.
you wanna go away with me this weekend?
why would I want to go away with you?
because of this.
we didn't go away when we were a couple.
now we're not a couple, and not couples have no reason to go away together.
Meredith, you're not paying attention.
I'm talking about 48 uninterrupted hours of this.
where would we go?
wine country.
wine country sounds like a couples' place.
well, there's wine, there's country, and you wouldn't see any of it.
we'd be in bed all weekend.
Oh, a weekend of sex.
now you're paying attention.
well, I would have to get someone to cover for me.
okay, so you're in?
48 uninterrupted hours of this.
I'm in.
Oh, great.
I'm stuck in the pit protecting smackheads and gangbangers with my idiot interns, and you're getting mcdreamied in the elevator?
really, smackheads and gangbangers at Seattle Grace, huh?
my point is, I hate interns.
well, Lexie's not that bad, is she?
Oh, are we not hating her anymore?
Oh, no. We still hate the idea of her.
we just realized we don't have a reason to hate the actual person.
she's an intern.
that's reason enough.
I think you may be the new Nazi.
damn right.
I don't see any charts.
will you work for me on Saturday?
what's in it for me?
what do you want?
take Norman off my hands today. - Who?
the world's oldest intern.
I've got mynterns in the pit, and he's only gonna slow me down.
ageist.
deal?
fine.
rounds.
still can't find Izzie.
I'm gonna have to put you in the clinic if you miss rounds.
Oh, the clinic!
uh, Ms. Sayles, hi. I'm Dr. Bailey.
Oh, you are?
uh, the boyfriend who warned her not to read on the stairmaster.
that's how I did this.
I fell off last night.
I took a ton of ibuprofen, but when I woke up this morning, it was huge and hideous.
how much ibuprofen did you take?
I usually take some every day anyway, because of the gym, so I doubled the dose, but it did nothing for me.
okay, let's get some x-rays and then...
actually, can I just get shot of cortisone or something?
I'm supposed to meet my trainer at noon.
uh, Ms. Sayles, I can't treat you until I find out what's wrong with you.
have you seen Dr. Stevens?
check the pit.
right.
what time do you think we'll be done?
just so I can tell my trainer.
Lexie! Sorry.
uh, have you seen Dr. Stevens? - No.
have you seen Dr. Yang? - No.
she told me to meet her here in the pit, and she's not here.
I don't want to give that woman any more reasons to hate me.
good for you. - I'm prepared.
I'm gonna answer every question correctly.
and I'm not gonna take any more of her crap.
three!
incoming, let's move.
he got hit during a scrimmage.
are you the coach?
he's my dad.
and his coach.
he was charging the receiver after the kickoff.
he got blocked, had his head down, couldn't see the other guy coming.
I had my head down because the guy blocking me was holding it down.
you could've gotten past that guy.
I need you to leave the room.
okay, let's cut him out of his equipment. I need the saw.
Dr. Grey, I need you to help me stabilize his neck and his head, please.
it's very important, Adam, that you not move your head.
I need you to keep perfectly still.
don't move.
relax.
O'malley, what's the hurry? - Sorry, I can't talk, chief.
I...
sorry, I...
I just gotta find Izzie.
she's at the third floor nurses' station.
Oh. Thanks.
Oh, and...and when you find her, tell her Dr. Torres is looking for her.
now I know charting doesn't seem as exciting as surgery, but it is every bit as important.
believe me when I tell you, people, penmanship saves lives.
pick up your phone.
what kind of doctor doesn't pick up their phone?
is that a 7 or is that a 9?
if I have to ask myself that question in the middle of an emergency, your patient is dead.
you killed him with your handwriting.
think about that.
Hey.
Hi.
we have to talk.
okay. Um, about?
george told me.
he told you? - Everything.
cafeteria, noon, you and me.
be there.
dude, is she gonna kick her ass?
she forgave you?
she said I had a rough year, that people make mistakes, and that...
that I made a mistake. - Oh, so now I'm a mistake?
back off!
no, she said that. I didn't say that.
what did you say?
um, I didn't expect her to forgive me.
I expected... rage, uh, bloodshed.
no, she's saving all her rage and bloodshed for me.
she's gonna kill me in the cafeteria at lunch. - No, she wouldn't.
she breaks bones for a living, George.
she's crazy.
no, she's not crazy.
well, she is if she thinks I'm not gonna put up a fight.
I can't believe that kid's dad.
I mean, his son is paralyzed, and the guy's still riding him.
focus more on the medicine, three, and less on the tragedy.
three?
is that a nickname?
you could say that.
so how would you proceed, Dr. Grey?
Oh, um...you won't be able to operate unless you realign his spine, would you?
and how would you do that?
traction halo?
very impressive, Dr. Grey.
your intern year's off to a good start.
how's it going?
how are you and Meredith?
it's weird, the whole family thing.
and plus, I think she might still hate me.
she doesn't hate you.
Really? Did she say that?
you know, why don't you go see if Mrs. Cooley's dressings need changing?
yang, why don't you go see if Mrs. Cooley's dressing needs changing?
certainly.
Dr. Sloan, Dr. Norman Shales.
Oh, Dr. Shales, call me Mark.
thank you.
I thought you were on my service.
I am.
he's my intern.
I know, right?
it's like, "seriously, you're an intern?"
but it's seriously true.
seriously.
glad to have you aboard Norman.
so is he the one you call, uh...
Mcdreamy or, mc, uh, sleazy, or mc, uh, wait a minute, what is it?
Norman, we have labs to deliver. - Yeah.
labs and discharges.
uh, this one's being discharged to hospice?
when there's nothing else we can do.
so we have to tell someone they're dying?
don't worry. I'll teach you the protocol.
Mcsteamy!
he's the one you girls call mcsteamy.
you paged me, Dr. Bailey?
Oh, I didn't know you were...
I'm in the clinic. Or I was...
what have you got?
says she twisted her ankle falling off the stairmaster.
she didn't twist it. She crushed it.
we should book an O. R. Right away.
Dr. Torres, you don't think we should run a few tests first?
find out why Ruthie's bones are so fragile in the first place?
she's osteoporotic.
I see it in older women all the time.
now you're seeing it in a 28 year old.
Oh, right.
call me when you get the test results.
I can't talk about it with you.
well, is she all right? - Yeah.
so when giving a patient the bad news, you want to be polite and detached, but not cold.
how can you be detached but not cold?
you show that you care without actually allowing yourself to care, because if you get too emotional, then they get scared, and then they get emotional, and that's bad.
Seriously?
stop with the seriously.
uh, I'm sorry.
I know it must be hard being older than most of us, but I think you're gonna go a lot further if you just let everything else go and focus on the medicine.
Hey, are you aware that mcdreamy and the other Grey are bonding? - Bonding?
over their mutual Meredith Greyness.
what do you mean? They're talking about me?
what are they saying? - Oh, I don't know.
he's making me deal with his patients while they focus on what's really important...you.
what was I saying?
you were saying how important it was to focus on the medicine.
just give me the chart.
first we're going to apply halo, which uses weights and traction to pull your spine back into place.
traction?
like at the gym.
we stretch your upper body using weights until the tension pops the spine into position.
except unlike at the gym, Dr. Shepherd needs to attach the traction device directly to your head by screwing two bolts into your skull.
that sounds painful.
painful is if he doesn't fix your spine.
painful is you never walk again.
okay.
we gonna do this thing or what?
I told you not to get too emotional.
I couldn't help it.
what now?
go apologize one last time.
once again, ma'am, we are very, very sorry...
very sorry.
and now?
now we slowly and respectfully back out of the room.
Alex, I need a favor.
I don't have time for favors.
I'm working here.
well, what are you doing at lunch?
according to my interns, I'm watching Torres kick your ass all up and down the cafeteria.
how do they know?
so it's true.
What'd you do to her?
nothing.
dude.
we need a little help here!
Oh, thank god. Somebody I know.
will somebody please make sure they page my husband?
who is she?
it's the chief's niece.
Camille Travis, 18, I tried intubating 3 times.
there's some kind of obstruction.
my baby can't breathe.
SATs staying down. They're at 82%.
she needs a surgical airway.
somebody get me a crike tray.
how many emergency crikes have you done?
including this one? One.
dude, it's the chief's niece.
pulse is getting weaker.
so we'd better not screw this up.
what are you doing?
trying to help her breathe.
she just slit her throat!
suction. I need suction.
get the retractors in. - There's so much blood.
you didn't hit an artery, did you?
no, not on purpose.
Oh, god. - Oh, god.
get the tube.
Oh, god.
SATs are going up.
Oh, we did it.
what the hell are you doing to my niece?
one thing this child did not need was another surgery.
she wasn't breathing, chief.
we didn't know what else to do.
you did the right thing.
but Camille was diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 14.
she's had both ovaries removed, a hysterectomy and now this...
there it is, the mass.
no wonder she couldn't breathe.
I can take it out.
but we won't know how many more there are until we do further studies.
I'm so sorry, chief.
she beat it twice before.
she'll beat it again.
I just had to tell a 48-year-old woman that she's gonna die.
yeah? I wish I could tell a 24-year-old woman she's gonna die.
I have gone out of my way to be nice to her, and this is what she does, talks about me behind my back?
when were you nice to her?
I was nice... once.
my point is...
Hey, Meredith.
Hey, Norman.
sup, Lexie?
come on, Norman.
Um...Dr. Shepherd asked that we meet in Adam's room in ten minutes.
you could at least acknowledge that you heard me.
you're using the Grey sister angle to get in good with the attendings.
I get that.
but you're here on my license.
so if you do anything, like kill someone, it's on me.
so for the rest of the day, you're gonna hug the wall.
you're not gonna say anything, you're not gonna do anything.
you're an intern.
are we clear...
three?
what?
it's Lexie, or Grey.
it's not three.
I have a name.
your blood tests show low electrolyte levels, low calcium and low vitamin D.
have you been dieting?
she just lost 40 pounds.
will told me if I ever got back down to a size 4, we'd move in together.
how romantic.
we both just needed motivation.
I told him I wouldn't live with a smoker, so he quit smoking.
the problem is, even if Dr. Torres is able to repair your fracture, it won't do any good unless you're eating more and working out less.
am I right, Dr. Torres?
Dr. Tor...
Hey, are you all right?
uh, uh, Bailey's right.
so what, you're saying that you won't operate unless she puts on a bunch of weight?
no, but, um...
then why are we still talking about this?
we came here to get her leg fixed.
so fix her leg.
okay.
how'd that discharge- to-hospice patient go?
not great.
there was crying and tears and...
more tears.
tears?
Really?
such a tough old bird.
I thought he'd take it like a man.
he'd take it like a "man"?
what, I'm sexist now?
no, "he" as in "him"?
joel Hanson in 2212.
not Gretchen Bitzer in 2213?
Oh, dear.
I thought that "2" was a "3.
Dr. Grey, did you and your intern tell a woman who came in to have her moles removed that she was dying?
Oh, dear.
I mean, crap.
Oh, crap.
you hear that?
like a weight room.
there's nothing to be scared of.
he's been weight training since he was 8 years old.
what did I say about you and the wall?
Dr. Yang, this is still a teaching hospital, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
you need to get a little closer if you want to learn something today, Dr. Grey.
okay, Adam, I'm going to attach the tongs now.
I need you to stay perfectly still during this procedure.
let the weights do all the work.
okay, you're gonna feel a little pressure, but with the meds we've given you, you shouldn't feel any pain.
all right.
here we go.
can you imagine being 14 years old and having some doctor tell you you've got cancer?
what do you do with that?
well, you fight. Camille's a fighter.
you two have that in common.
so what's it gonna be, Stevens gets her bones broken or Torres gets taken to the trailer park?
neither. It's not happening.
but if it does, will you pull her off me?
you gonna tell me what you did to her?
you have to promise not to say anything to anybody.
swear.
I swear.
jeez.
I slept with George.
I know.
I'm a terrible person.
which is why I'm gonna let her get one good punch in.
maybe two.
I deserve it.
no, one. Then you pull her off me.
you slept with O'Malley?
Alex, you just said you wouldn't say anything.
I won't, believe me.
this...
I'm embarrassed for you.
you had one job... one job... read the charts.
you want to yell at me some more?
you can, because I am an intern and according to Dr. Bailey, yelling is how we learn.
well, I'm not a very good yeller.
Oh, I'm sure it just takes practice.
perhaps Ms. Bitzer will show us how it's done.
just let me do all the talking.
ms. Bitzer...
she left about an hour ago.
she's gone?
left the hospital?
feel like yelling now?
your C.T. Results showed that not only is the cancer back, it's spread to your chest, lungs and throat.
we have options, though.
we can operate.
we can be even more aggressive with the chemo and radiation than the last time.
I just want to go home.
we could try to treat you at home, but, Camille, you...
no, you don't understand.
I don't want any treatment.
what?
Camille, don't say that.
I've tried, mama.
it not working.
I can't do it anymore.
you can do, you will.
you have no choice.
I'm 18 now, Aunt Adele.
I do have a choice.
you may be 18, baby girl, but you are clearly not capable of making life-and-death decisions for yourself right now.
tell her, Richard.
Camille... - no, you tell her.
tell her how the radiation almost killed me last time, how I got hepatitis and my kidneys shut down and my skin was so raw I couldn't touched.
Camille... - I'm dying.
we all know that.
I don't want to spend what little time I have left in this hospital.
I want to spend time with my friends.
I want to sleep in my own bed, and I want to be home.
so please don't be my doctor right now.
be my uncle who loves me.
let me go home.
try not to move your head, Adam.
I'm...I'm trying, but...
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
you'll take as much as they give you, son.
okay, now come on! You can do this.
it's just another few pounds.
Dr. Yang, maybe we should... - no one asked you.
I-I can't.
please take it off.
no, no. Can't quit.
push through it.
okay, just one more plate.
Adam, you're strong. You can handle this.
want to be a quitter, do you? Huh, do you?
okay, you know what? That's it. That's it.
that's 20 pounds.
there, you did it. Right?
told you could do it.
somebody get him out. Please. Somebody get him out.
Adam, I'm just trying to help out.
please get out! Get out!
get out! Get out! - Adam, Adam, calm down.
try not to upset him.
Adam. Adam, calm down. - Get...get...
Adam, it's o... it's okay.
what are you doing? Don't touch him.
the slightest movement could...
put his hand down, gently.
I'm so sorry. I forgot.
now step away from the patient and leave the room.
get out right now or I will throw you out.
Dr. Grey, take over for Dr. Yang.
Dr. Yang, a word.
you are a resident now.
your job is to teach interns, not abuse them.
I wasn't. She grabbed his...
until you learn to be less competitive and less selfish, you will not assist on my surgeries.
you will observe them.
but she... - you can go.
Arlene, she's just tired.
she doesn't know what she's saying.
but she's right.
she's not gonna get any better.
we don't know that, Arlene.
there's always a chance.
not if she doesn't get treatment.
you've got to talk to her, Richard.
you've... you have to convince her.
she loves you.
she trusts you.
and she's the closest thing we have to a child of our own.
Richard, I'm begging you.
please.
save our baby girl.
again, Ms.Bitzer, it's very important that you call us back.
you idiots still can't find her?
I called her home, her cell, her next of kin.
I don't care if you have to call every Bitzer on the planet.
find her!
I am really so very sorry about this.
it's not entirely your fault, Norman.
you're just an intern.
I should've double-checked the charts.
I was distracted by things I shouldn't be distracted by.
for what it's worth, Lexie Grey is a good girl.
she's very sweet.
I don't think she would say anything untoward or uncool.
I have Bitzers to call.
but, you know, you could take the...
I'm not a bad resident, am I?
don't ask me. I lost a patient today.
Oh, you killed someone?
lost. Literally can't find.
shepherd says I'm selfish and competitive.
what the hell is wrong with that?
I kick ass. I'm an excellent resident.
I'm not.
in addition to losing my patient, I also lost my intern.
turned around, he was gone. AWOL.
see, what...what is wrong with these interns?
we weren't like this.
we were great interns.
I was great.
you were...you were good.
you guys seen Callie? - No.
is it time for her to grind your bones into dust?
you don't think I can take her?
are you guys really doing this? - You heard?
the whole hospital heard.
Yeah, well, that explains the line at the salad bar.
well, what are you fighting about?
believe me, you don't want to know.
I'm just saying, whatever it is, it's not worth it.
actually, it is.
some things are worth fighting for.
picking up repeat labs for Ruthie Sayles.
so who's your money on, O'Malley? Guess you gotta back the wife, huh?
what? What are you talking about?
the fight downstairs. Torres vs. Stevens.
what are they fighting about anyway?
Oh, Maile, that's just a rumor.
it's not happening.
Callie is way too mature for that.
that's not what my buddy in the cafeteria just said.
O'malley, your labs! - Gotta go! I'll be right back!
I'm just saying, I learned how to fight in a trailer park. Okay?
Where'd she learn to fight, boarding school? Not quite the same thing.
I'm a street fighter.
I've got some badass in me.
I could take a girl down.
punch with your left. Protect your face with your right.
no, your hands... protect your surgeon hands.
your face can heal.
here we go.
let's do this.
let's go.
let's go.
go where? - You know, go.
I wanted to talk.
you want to talk. You don't want to kick my ass?
you thought I was gonna fight you? You...
that's cr...
excuse me.
that's a forfeit. Torres forfeits.
Oh, my god.
you were very ghetto fabulous.
Oh, my god.
what happened? Was there a fight?
no.
guess they realized they were fighting over nothing.
Hey, what do you think's a better weekend getaway, Napa or Sonoma?
I hope you don't mind if I kill your girlfriend.
well, first of all, she's not my girlfriend.
second of all, I do mind.
interns should be seen and not heard.
they shouldn't talk to patients.
that's how they learn.
which means I have to teach, and then I have to deal with their problems when they screw up.
Meredith rarely screws up, and she's not an intern.
so napa or sonoma, what do you think?
Sonoma. - Mm.
smaller hotels, fewer tourists.
she's still an intern. Don't kid yourself.
she's green, she's a baby, and the only difference between her and that old guy she's got trailing her is that you're not sleeping with the old guy.
sorry I'm late.
well, I was just explaining the surgery.
since your bones have splintered, Dr. Torres will place metal plates and screws to hold the ankle together.
how long will the recovery time be?
it's hard to say.
you'll be in a cast 8 to 12 weeks.
three months?
right, Dr. Torres?
longer if she doesn't eat.
she eats.
not enough to keep her bones from snapping, but you don't seem too concerned about that.
what is your problem, lady? - I don't have problem.
I'm not the one who has to live with you. - You know what?
this is... you have a problem... - Ruthie!
in here go ahead.
in here.
I thought Ruthie wasn't going into surgery till tomorrow.
that's before she started vomiting blood.
she's got a bleeding duodenal ulcer.
how did we not see this?
she came in with a broken ankle.
her malnutrition and the amount of ibuprofen she's been taking, she's lucky to be alive.
why did she do this to herself?
cause people are stupid and just want to be loved.
that's the only reason anybody does anything.
asystole.
OK, start C.P.R.
you think he'll walk again?
it's not impossible.
Mm. We have a bleeder.
I need you to cauterize the vein, Dr. Grey.
Oh, okay.
I...
I, um...
I-I can't find it.
I-I-I can't see where it starts. Um...
it's coming too quickly.
stop. Suction around it.
you have to see where the bleed is coming from first.
follow the flow to the source. Good.
okay, now bovie it.
got it.
good job.
Dr. Yang, if you don't mind stepping in?
Dr. Grey.
Norman, where have you been?
I was... - Norman, do you think you can just cut out on me in the middle of a crisis?
I-I went... - Where, Norman?
where did you go that was important enough to just disappear in the middle of a shift?
ms. Bitzer's apartment. - You went to Ms. Bitzer's apartment.
I told her she had a bill outstanding.
she's right behind me. - Oh.
Oh, but if I may say so, your yelling has improved remarkably.
thank you.
I-I'm sorry I missed your calls.
I didn't mean to cut out on my bill.
it's just, I got a lot of living to do and not a lot of time to do it in.
actually... - I quit my job, dumped my loser boyfriend, told my boss where he could shove it, and bought a one-way ticket to Iceland, where the sun never sets, which is fine by me.
I'll sleep when I'm dead, right?
you're, uh, not going to die, Ms. Bitzer.
I'm not? - There was a mix-up with your labs.
you're going to live, hopefully a very long, healthy life.
I quit my job.
I broke up with my boyfriend.
I gave up my apartment.
you know how hard it is to find an apartment with parking?
I thought you quit smoking.
wasn't that the deal?
Ruthie loses 40 pounds, you quit smoking?
my girlfriend's in emergency surgery.
I think she'll forgive me for smoking.
no, no, she won't, because she's dead.
Ruthie's dead.
Dr. Bailey tried to stop the bleeding, but because she was starving herself and over training, her heart couldn't take the strain.
you think this is my fault?
she wanted to lose the weight.
I just wanted her to be healthy.
she was healthy 20 pounds ago.
you just wanted her to be hot, - especially if you are gonna move in with her, right? - No, that...
I loved her. - You didn't love her.
you just didn't want to be alone or maybe she was good for your ego or...
or maybe she made you feel better about your miserable life, but you didn't love her because you don't destroy the person that you love!
callie! - Get her away from me, man.
get her away from me. - You gonna hit me? You gonna hit me?
give me any excuse to kick somebody's ass today - because I am dying to! - Don't touch me!
Dr. Torres!
uh, sir, we are so sorry for your loss.
O'malley, please take... - sir, why don't you come with me?
come on.
okay, I'm gonna ask you one last time, are you all right?
I'm fine. It's nothing.
Really?
cause nothing almost cost you your career just now.
the mass we removed from your throat was so big you couldn't breathe.
what took you so long to come in?
I knew the cancer wasn't gone.
it's never been gone.
it's never gonna be gone.
and...
don't tell my mom, but the truth is...
I was hoping it would kill me before I had to come back here.
I'm just so tired, Uncle Richard.
I am so, so tired.
what I have here is a plan to keep you alive.
it involves 12 oncologists, 8 new drugs, six experimental treatments from three different continents.
I have no idea if it'll work.
but as your uncle...
I'm begging you to take it.
because I know for a fact the world...
my world...
is a better place with you in it.
However...as your doctor,
I promise to do whatever you want.
I just want to go home.
then let's get you home.
Callie, wait. Please, wait.
please.
I'm sorry about the cafeteria.
I didn't know that you wanted to talk to me.
I thought you wanted to kill me.
I'm sorry about everything.
with George, I...
I'm really sorry.
I feel terrible.
you feel terrible?
you took advantage. He was your best friend. I tried to trust you so much, I had convinced myself that it was all in my head, that I was crazy.
but I wasn't, was I?
and then you pull that thing in the cafeteria today?
it's not bad enough that you humiliate me by getting in bed with my husband.
you have to humiliate me at work, too.
george might be the one that broke his vows, but you...
we're women, Izzie. You did this to another woman.
you...
took something from me.
you stole something from me like a petty little thief.
you are the one who should be humiliated.
you are the one who should be ashamed.
you are the one who should...
don't you dare come to me for forgiveness, you traitorous bitch.
what, I'm invisible now?
what do you want?
so you hate me now, too.
well, join the club.
you and O'Malley?
O'Malley! - What?
what is it that I did that is so horrifying?
I fell in love, Alex.
he's married. - Yeah, so?
you're carrying a big ol' torch for Ava or Jane Doe or whatever it is that you call her, and she's married.
so what gives you the right to judge what I do?
why do you even care?
you told me you weren't ready yet...
after Denny...to be with anyone.
and then O'Malley? O'Malley.
and then you tell me like I'm one of your chick friends.
come on.
ms. Bitzer, I just wanted to apologize one more time.
Oh, and I just wanted to say thank you, Dr. Grey.
and, you, too, Dr. Shales. Bless you.
Bye-bye.
she's not going to sue? - Nope.
our lawyer talked her into settling.
Seattle Grace just bought that woman four bedrooms - I'm so sorry. - Well, don't tell me.
tell the chief. I'm writing you both up.
it wasn't Norman's fault. He's my responsibility.
I'm the resident. I'm the only one you should write up.
that's very noble of you, Dr. Grey.
stupid...
but noble.
Oh.
for the record, Dr. Grey, I don't think you're stupid at all.
I find you...
quite smart.
what did you say to Camille?
Adele... I've already lost one baby.
and now I have to lose Camille?
I am not going to use Camille to try and make up for the fact that I never gave you children.
I never asked you to.
I asked you to talk to her, to convince her to...
I can't do that...
I can't do that, Adele.
I can give her all the options in the world, but I cannot make her do what I want her to do.
I'm her doctor.
I thought being a doctor was about saving lives.
after all these years of choosing your job over your family, the one time I ask you to do your job to save this family...
Adele, I'm sorry.
I'm truly, truly sorry, but...
so am I, Richard.
you can't...
just forgive me.
what I did to you...
I-is unforgivable.
that's how it works. That's what "I forgive you" means.
no, see, I...
I think it means you don't forgive me. I...
you don't know how to talk to me right now.
I mean, look, you don't...you can't even look at me.
you're so angry that...
I think the only way you can deal with me is to say you forgive me and...
what, we pretend it didn't happen?
I...
it happened.
and you don't forgive me.
you're right.
I don't.
so I got Alex to cover for me. - Oh.
so I can leave right after I round on my patients. - Yeah.
48 uninterrupted hours... - Yeah, yeah. Um...
you know what? Maybe this is not a good weekend.
what did Lexie say about me?
she didn't say anything. I did all the talking.
look, don't blame her.
so what, you're friends with my sister now?
I mean, you talk to the other Grey about me?
Mm-hmm.
you know what I talked about with the other Grey?
all the things this Grey won't let me say.
you can say anything to me.
I want to marry you.
I want to have kids with you.
I want to build us a house.
I want to settle down and grow old with you.
I want to die when I'm 110 years old in your arms.
I don't want 48 uninterrupted hours.
I want a lifetime.
Mm-hmm.
do you see what happens?
I say things like that, and you fight the urge to run in the opposite direction.
it's okay.
I understand.
I didn't, but now I do. I do.
you're just getting started
and I've been doing this for a long time.
deep down...
you're still an intern.
and you're not ready.
I'm not ready right now.
but things could stay the way they are...
and I can get ready. I'll get ready.
things can stay the way they are.
we can still meet in the elevator or the on call room.
and maybe you'll be ready.
and I'll wait.
I'll wait until you're ready.
okay, then.
Yeah, but what if...
what if while I'm waiting I meet someone who is ready to give me what I want from you?
what if you do?
I don't know.
forgive and forget.
that's what they say.
I just wanted to say, um, thank you for saving my ass today in surgery.
well, that's my job, three.
now where are Adam's post-op labs?
it's good advice, but it's not very practical.
I'll get them, Dr. Yang.
when someone hurts us...
we want to hurt them back.
come in.
keep it down, will you?
when someone wrongs us, we want to be right.
without forgiveness, old scores are never settled...
old wounds never heal.
and the most we can hope for is that one day we'll be lucky enough to forget.
what's the matter with you?
I have to start dating.
the sex with Izzie. It's like she's trying too hard.
I got fired.
what's the problem with you and your sister anyway?
she's not my sister.
we have the same dad.
you killed my wife. You took her from me.
what do you need, scotch, vodka, gin?
just don't tell Meredith.
there comes a point in your life when you're officially an adult.
suddenly you're old enough to vote, drink and engage in other adult activities.
so.
why the brain?
why biology's crown jewel?
you mean why did I go into neurosurgery?
come on. Share.
share with Sydney.
it was the headset with the magnifying glasses that tipped the scale for me.
and the man has a sense of humor.
I like that.
suddenly people expect you to be responsible.
serious, a grown-up.
work stuff.
um, as if you didn't know. I'll just be a second.
I think they're on a date.
that's definitely a date, right?
maybe she's dying.
is she dying? Is that why?
Oh, come on. Grow up.
she's nice. She asked me out.
want me to fake a heart attack? I do a great fake heart attack.
here she comes. -Carry on.
it's Sydney.
in the movies, when the handsome but sensitive football player kisses the awkward, freaky girl in front of the whole school.
that girl is her.
you are very awkward and freaky.
we get taller,
but do we ever really grow up?
do you know what kind of batteries these take?
double A.
is it really? Do you have one?
I have some in my locker. Yeah.
we're avoiding them now. It's come to that.
why are you avoiding Izzie?
it's like we're not us anymore.
everything used to be so easy. Talking at least used to be easy.
now look. We can't even talk anymore.
Oh, Derek went on a date with Sydney Heron last night.
it was probably a fake date to make me think he's healthy and moving on.
and do you think he's healthy and moving on?
can we just take the stairs? -Okay.
Bailey. I, uh.
just, uh, I wanted to congratulate you.
I'm sorry if things got.
you deserve the job.
Oh, does she ever.
come here, new chief resident. Huh?
someone deserves a big hug.
Oh, come on, Sydney.
well, I admit, I'm a. I'm a wee bit jealous.
but the chief has made his decision, and I will abide by it.
Oh, Callie, I'm, uh, I'm so sorry.
I'm fine with it.
Oh, good. We're being a-a brave soldier.
no, really. I'm fine with it.
let's not spoil this moment for Miranda. Okay?
all right, listen up.
I have nothing but respect for the job done by Dr. Torres, but things are gonna be different from here on in.
things are totally weird between George and me. We can't even hold a normal conversation.
this will be a professional environment.
so your love lives, your hopes and dreams, the little joys and tragedies that make you who you are have no place in my hospital.
he's acting like a total stranger, like I don't even know him.
the locker room is for changing, not for crying.
the on call room is for napping, not for anything that requires a locked door.
Oh, my god. Don't even get me started on the sex.
it is just tragic. It's like.
Stevens, did you hear a word I said?
grow up, I believe, is my point.
uh, Dr. Bailey, um, can you make sure I stay on Dr. Hahn's cardio service?
already done.
but if you piss her off or mess up or in any way embarrass me, that's it, no more chances.
thank you. Thank you. I will be the best resident she's ever had.
no, yang, I will be the best resident she's ever had.
Yes, right second to you.
his incision is healing nicely.
no erythema or purulent discharge.
he'll be monitored, and we'll try weaning him off the drip once his meds are maximized.
after discharge, we expect him to follow up in the cardiac clinic.
there are four other people here, Yang.
how about letting one of them talk?
Mr. Talbot's cardiomyopathy is unusually complicated, that's all.
you know, you could take a cue from Dr. Stevens.
she knows what's going on with her patients, and she's inclusive.
what do we got?
high school bus crash. Bunch of kids just came in.
we got more on the way.
Tricia Hale, 17, vital signs stable.
sustained a large facial laceration, trauma to the buttock area and an open fracture to the lower right leg.
okay, Trauma Room Two.
it's still bleeding. My face is still bleeding.
all right. We'll get to that in a minute, okay?
we? No, try the head of plastic surgery.
no one is touching my face until I've spoken to the head of plastic surgery. No one.
34-year-old passenger Marcus King, no complaints except deep cuts on his left arm.
stable on route.
listen, I'm fine. Please help the kids first.
they're being taken care of, sir. What happened?
I was taking the kids on a tour of colleges.
we're from California.
the bus slid down an embankment.
one, two, three.
what's your name? -Danny.
Hey, uh, Danny, I'm gonna take this off so I can have a look, okay?
man, high school really does suck.
it was that asshat Sully and his stupid friends!
the driver kept turning around, telling them to shut up.
I'm just drawing a logo, and suddenly I'm upside-down.
and the pencil went, like, all the way in Danny's eye.
Yeah, I can see that.
should I call his parents?
why don't you let us do that?
Sully and those jerks should be in jail. You should be calling the police, not my parents.
you just need to not think about those kids, okay?
you're gonna be out of high school soon. You never have to see 'em again.
Oh, yeah. I still gotta finish.
Danny, you need to calm down. Okay?
cause when you raise your voice when you get upset, your blood pressure shoots up, and you could lose your eye.
I need you to stay calm.
okay, I'll try.
listen, I really can't feel what you're doing.
but I hope you're not leaving a big, old scar.
no, no. No, no.
just a few little stitches. I do stitches all the time, so.
do you want me to take over, Dr. Bailey?
uh, no, no. I do stitches all the time, O'Malley.
I just thought with all the more serious injuries coming in, you'd want me to take over.
I'm fine here.
you're not the boss of me.
actually, I'm the boss of him, if you want to know. I'm the chief resident.
what? -Yeah.
Oh, Mandi.
you know something? I'm not surprised.
Hey, did you know that we went to high school together?
Really? -Yeah, yeah.
and this girl right here, she is a genius.
used to help me with all my homework.
just a few papers. That's all.
Oops.
Dr. Bailey.
I-I do stitches all the time.
I know, but you might want to take a listen.
something wrong with my ticker?
okay.
um, part of your heart, uh, may be working overtime, so, I, uh, will get his E.K.G. And page Hahn.
will you finish the sutures?
you can't finish this?
I. yes.
I can do it. Sure.
I'll do it. You go get Hahn.
okay.
you'd better be able to fix my face.
I have pom statewides in a month.
you're a cheerleader?
I'm a pom.
cheerleaders just jump around.
poms are dancers.
I was on the football team.
Yeah, I'm not sure you're gonna be doing any dancing in the next month.
you'd better be lying.
not lying. You have very serious knee and leg fractures, not to mention a cracked coccyx.
what the hell is that?
that's the bone at the bottom of your spine.
the bottom of your bottom.
my ass?
I broke my ass?
that's one way to look at it.
don't look at it.
okay, you're gonna need surgery.
but the good news is that we'll put you under so that we can fix the bones and Dr. Sloan can fix your face all at the same time.
you'd better be good.
baby, you're not gonna find anybody better than me.
Oh, my god. Hot cheerleader ass.
take a cue from Stevens.
from Izzie Stevens. Seriously?
you need to cut Izzie some slack. Her and George are having problems.
already? It's only been a week.
at that point, you don't even talk. All you do is have sex.
doesn't mean you can't have problems.
Derek and I are having all kinds of sex, and he's dating other people.
you didn't hear any of this.
Oh, please.
fine. Whatever.
you paged me because you couldn't handle a few stitches on a wino?
he keeps hollering for Dr. Grey. I wasn't sure if I should get her or call the cops or what.
that's not Dr. Grey. Dr. Grey's a girl.
I want my daughter!
stay here. Make sure he doesn't leave.
would you page.
would you page her? -Karev.
keep Meredith out of it.
get Lexie.
Yes, sir. -g-r-e-y!
I need to talk to you about your dad.
Oh, you know what? I don't want to talk about my dad.
in fact, we're never gonna talk about him again, okay?
you helped me out once. Now it's over.
I can't believe I gotta fill out all this stuff.
I mean, a kid gets a bump on the head, and you've... you've practically gotta write a novel?
listen, Mandi, I know you're really busy but if there's any chance, any chance at all you could help me with some of this stuff.
patients are supposed to fill those out. It's not really the doctor's job.
you be quiet.
uh, don't worry about it, Marcus. We'll figure out something.
good ol' Mandi. You always got my back, huh?
you hush now.
I hate to interrupt the reminiscing, but I am trying to listen here.
you do have atrial fibrillation.
but you're not symptomic, so that's a good sign.
we'll start you on some blood thinners and do an outpatient workup.
a treatment plan you could've made yourself, Dr. Bailey, if you weren't acting like such a blithering idiot.
teacher's pet's in trouble.
Oh, come on. Hush now, Marcus King.
Hey, you paged?
Yeah, your dad's here. -What?
he's drunk, he's noisy, and you need to take him off my hand.
I have a broken ass I have to get back to.
call Lexie.
I called Lexie. She's not coming.
and the next person I'm gonna call is the cops.
leave me alone. -Cause the guy's ready to get outta here, and there's no way he can drive.
Oh, gosh. It's good to see you.
see! That's her. Meredith Grey.
I'm sorry.
I really, really am.
I'm sure you are.
the last time I was here, I said some terrible things to you.
telling you not to come to Susan's funeral? It wasn't your fault.
I know you did everything you could.
what I said to you.
I'll regret it till the day I die.
and the drinking
is unacceptable, yeah.
but today, uh.
today is Susan's birthday. Birthday, and I.
should I go get Lexie?
no, just you.
I just want you.
I never knew what to say to them in high school, kids like him.
they were always so separate from the rest of us, you know, alone.
it wasn't like that for me. I.
I was prom queen and class valedictorian.
Yeah, I wouldn't broadcast that.
I had a great group of friends, you know?
not really.
well, let's see what we got here.
Oh, you see that, Dr. Stevens? -Yeah.
looks like the pencil lifted up one of the branches of the A.C.A.
is that a-a bleed?
it is. It's a little one.
we need to get that pencil out of there before it gets any bigger.
I'll book an O. R.
I am not a blithering idiot.
Hahn had no right to speak to me that way, no right at all.
but Marcus isn't.
well, he's just not an old friend, is he? He's.
he was maybe your boyfriend or.
you know, high schoosweetheart or.
I was his tutor. Okay?
he was a track star, didn't have a lot of time for homework, so I helped him with his math and reading.
and French and chemistry.
then he was just a friend?
Really?
okay, there was some talk, the possibility of us going to the homecoming together, but it.
it didn't work out, and I was fine with that.
certainly not a blithering idiot today.
nor any other day in my life.
these and that and that. Thank you.
is it me, or are there teenyboppers staring at you?
I get that a lot. It started when I was there age, never really went away.
is that so?
what can I do for you, ladies?
tell him.
no, it's, it's embarrassing.
you can tell me.
you look exactly like her dad.
swing and a miss.
I'm going crazy with this Hahn thing.
every time I try and impress her, she hates me even more.
not worth getting hung up on.
why, did something happen?
apparently they're not even talking to each other at this point.
I know it's wrong, but that makes me feel better.
you're not gonna sit?
um, I was gonna, but I-I really need to cram. I got a really big surgery today.
you know, we're operating on the kid with the pencil, so I'll see you.
okay, see you around. -Okay.
will she be able to sit on her butt again?
or will she have to carry around one of those toilet seats for the rest of her life?
she'll have full use of her butt in a few weeks.
I am so, so honored to be filling in for you as captain.
you're filling in for me as captain?
I prayed on it, and god seems to think it's the right move.
Oh, okay.
Oh, and I don't want you to worry.
I called Randy, and I think I might have convinced him to still take you to homecoming even though your face and your butt's all messed up.
I bet he'll take you.
he's classy that way.
okay, so now that we've established that Randy's a classy guy, visiting time is over.
Bye, sweetie.
I hope they don't ruin your face.
go!
kinda sucks, huh?
little manicured vultures.
my life is over.
my life is over.
mom.
I-I love you, too.
will. will you.
will you tell dad.
Hello?
Hello?
thanks to your piece-of-crap phone, my mom's gonna think I died.
this is where. -Yeah.
but we'll keep you updated.
you'd better not end up blind and go to some blind kid's school, cause, um, if I have to go back to junior year without you, you're gonna be deadeat.
later, freak.
you're the freak.
you are. -You are.
I promised this kid life gets better after high school. He deserves to see that.
he's got a good friend. That's something.
that girl has been by his bedside all day.
Yeah, but even so, those cliques, they're miserable.
he just needs to know it passes eventually.
sorry, Dr. Shepherd.
what's so funny?
I'm just not sure we've come as far as you'd like to think, clique-wise.
we? -The hospital.
you think the hospital's clique-y? Oh, damn it.
the artery's burst.
his brain is swelling. It's cutting off blood supply.
okay, push 80 grams of mannitol.
okay, let's go.
how do I tell his best friend that he's gonna be in a coma for the rest of his life?
you can't tell her yet, Derek. The family has to know first.
Danny's doctor.
Oh, thank god.
it's only been a few hours without Danny, and I'm already starting to freak out.
I mean, look what I have to put up with.
they're crying, like, actual real tears.
cause they're so worried about Danny, which would be fine if they knew who Danny was.
whatever.
can I see him?
he hasn't woken up yet.
but he's okay?
as soon as I know something, I'll let you know.
okay.
you think she'll recover full function of her knee?
I hope so, 'cause if she doesn't get back on the pom-pom brigade, her life is totally over.
man, you'd think the way they treat her, she'd be ready to ditch the whole thing, but no.
of course she's not gonna walk away from that.
it's her life. It's her identity.
it's the only way she understands herself in the world.
I heard one of the, uh, sweet young things told Mark he looked like her dad today.
harsh.
what does that have to do with anything?
well, you just seem really empathetic to her plight, you know?
loss of identity, shattered self-image.
you seem pretty happy about what happened to her. -No.
she's just happy 'cause Stevens and O'Malley hit the skids.
didn't I tell you not to tell anybody?
I pulled all the X-rays for tomorrow's scheduled surgeries.
and what am I supposed to do with them?
Oh, I thought I could put them in the O.R. If you needed me to.
well, I don't.
back off.
what?
you're being a brownnoser.
I'm helping her. - No, you're annoying her.
you got a chance to show her what you can do, and now you're blowing it.
and trust me, these kinds of chances do not come around all the time.
so, you know, just back off.
I'm sorry I didn't know you when you were in high school.
I've regretted it every day, not knowing you.
sometimes I still worry about you.
then other times I think, you know, maybe that's what made you so strong.
not an excuse. Not at all.
but you are so strong. Gosh. You're stronger than Lexie.
I don't know her that well.
true.
you're a very impressive person, Meredith.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm a lifetime.
lifetime's worth of proud.
anyway.
how was your date with Sydney?
Oh, I was wondering when you were gonna bring that up.
my dad's in the E.R. - Really?
he cut himself.
he's not bad company, actually.
he's quite funny and charming. Drunk.
is it weird that I like my drunk dad better than my regular dad?
a little.
are you okay?
Yeah. I, um.
but my patient's in a coma, and he's never gonna wake up again.
his best friend is in the waiting area.
the poor thing thinks he's.
she thinks he's gonna wake up any second.
I don't know.
I don't believe it. Who told you?
Henry. He was observing in, uh, Sloan's surgery, and he said that Sloan announced it to the whole O.R.
O'malley and Stevens are done. - Yeah.
they didn't even last a week. - I know.
can I have the key back to my house?
Hey. What?
the key to my house, I want it back. I heard we broke up, so I want it back.
can I have it please?
um, you know right now I don't have any idea what you're talking about?
Really? Apparently everyone's talking about the fact that we broke up.
who have you been talking to, George?
nobody. I mean, I talked to Meredith.
see, I knew it. -What do you mean, you knew it?
you been talking to her?
Yeah, but only after you were talking to her.
so, uh, I'm not the only one who talked to her then.
you talked to her first.
what is my dad doing here?
your dad came in drunk this morning. That's what I was trying to tell you earlier when you blew me off.
so, so you run to Meredith?
the one person that I asked you not to tell?
I was trying to help, okay?
right.
you know, you haven't changed.
I mean, not even one bit.
you get this very intense look on your face when you're serious, you know?
it's your serious, home-work-doin' face. Hasn't changed.
Dr. Bailey, is that a patient form I see in your hand?
Yes, I suppose it is.
patients are supposed to fill out patient forms.
you have work to do, your own work.
Yes, sir.
Mandi? - Mandi, I'm not.
I'm not feeling so. - Marcus? Marcus?
Pulse-ox is dropping. - Pressure is 82 over 48.
tell radiology we need a stat spiral C.T. And page Dr. Hahn.
Dr. Shepherd.
I know Danny's parents aren't gonna be here for a couple more hours, but could I at least see him? Please.
all right, come on. Let's. let's go sit down.
see, the, uh.
when I removed the pencil, the artery burst.
when the brain swells that much, it has nowhere to go.
the hemor.
I am getting two cups of coffee.
two. One for me, one for my dad.
he's here.
what's wrong with you?
at this exact moment in O.R. Two, Dr. Hahn is performing a pulmonary embolectomy.
a pulmonary embolectomy, Meredith.
so what's the problem? You're on her service. Just go.
no, I can't because that will make me a brownnoser, and everybody hates brownnosers.
I cannot be a brownnoser.
okay. So.
there'll be other embolectomies. You can let this one slide?
no, no, no. No, I can't!
I don't know how to just let a pulmonary embolectomy slide.
sure you can. It's just like cutting a class.
you never cut a class.
never, not once.
that was a pretty big V.S.D. on the echo.
I'm gonna have to do an additional arteriotomy of the right P.A.
you should've taken the situation seriously. You should've ordered further tests.
maybe I should've. Or maybe you should've.
and if you weren't so busy flirting with the patient like a love-struck teenager, maybe you would have.
forceps, please.
this is so sad. I used to walk by his house every day.
he was in my algebra class, I think.
I know that this seems impossible right now, but you will get through this.
Danny would've wanted you to.
you don't know what he would've wanted. You're just like them.
you're a prom queen, and you're trying to act like you know what it's like for me.
you have no idea what it's like.
I wasn't a prom queen.
I was the girl in the cheap clothes from the trailer park who got pregnant and got thrown in the pregnant girls' class.
none of the mothers would let their kids hang out with me.
but I got through it.
you will get through this.
I'm gonna write a letter to his mom and dad.
that's really beautiful.
get out. - What?
get out. You're not even supposed to be in here.
she's here. - She's his friend, his best friend.
go away. Go.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
it's okay.
you just lost your best friend. It's, it's the worst thing in the world.
Oh, Dr. Shepherd. - Yes.
I'm sorry. A-about Danny Metcalf.
it looked like it was hard on you, which is good.
if I had a son going through that, I'd want the surgeon to be fully invested like you were.
you have no idea who I am, do you?
of course I do.
Bye, Dr. Shepherd.
you're the nurse in O.R. Two? The one that talked about cliques?
Yeah. Right?
I am never gonna be captain again.
you know, I was. I was fired from a job recently.
you were fired from being a doctor, and they let you cut open my ass?
okay, shut your trap for eight seconds and let me finish.
I didn't get fired from being a doctor.
I got fired from being, like, well, our version of squad captain, which is mostly about organizing crap.
not about surgery.
so? -So.
I got to go back to the part that I like, which. It's kind of a gift.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
uh, you paged, Dr. Hahn?
apparently when you ask for copies of the C.T. Angio around here, people think it's all right to just give you the slices that contain the clot.
can you please bring me the entire C.T?
absolutely, yes. Absolutely. I'll do that right now.
your dad was in the E.R. Today.
I know.
so you know he was drunk and he put his hand through a window.
Yeah. Anything else?
I know it was Susan's birthday, and I'm sure it was a very hard day for the both of you.
and he wasn't actually a problem. He was kind of charming. But he seemed very sad, and I'd hate to see it happen again.
so maybe you should think about keeping a better eye on him.
every day is my mother's birthday.
my mother was born in March.
he lied. He's a liar.
and I'm glad, really, I'm glad that you found him charming.
I'm sure he was delightful.
he's a blast after five drinks.
not so much after nine, though. He gets a little weepy and mean.
he's a drunk, Meredith.
he probably came in and told you how wonderful you are, how sad he is that he doesn't get to spend more time with you.
yesterday he said that I was his favorite daughter.
the day before, I was an ungrateful bitch.
the week before, he wrote me a check for $20, 000
because he said I deserved everything life had to offer because he was so proud of me, a lifetime's worth of proud.
so thank you for letting me know that I need to keep a better eye on him.
Thanks.
Meredith, you want to come in for a minute and sit down?
I'm sorry about all this.
Meredith, please. You have nothing to apologize for, nothing at all.
I'm keeping you from doing your job.
this is my job, at least part of it.
think of it as the principal's office, only I'm the nice principal.
anyway, I promised your mom I'd take care of you.
I told you, you don't have to do that.
I know. I know I don't.
but I do.
Hey, you. - Hey, you.
I guess I'm still alive and kickin', huh?
you're gonna be kickin' for a good long time now, Marcus King.
you have always been my angel.
I never would've made it through this day without you.
come on. - Mandi, I mean it.
thank you. I thank you.
my mama thanks you.
and you know my daddy thanks you.
you tell your mama and daddy I said they're welcome.
Oh, hey. I was, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to finish up that paperwork.
I wouldn't ask, but, you know,
I think a lot of it was kind of important.
no, I didn't. Uh, I - I was planning on, uh.
I just gotta, uh, you know, finish it right now.
Thanks.
you're the best.
with all due respect, this has reached critical mass.
you saved his life, and he's taking you for granted.
you know what he deserves?
a long speech.
you need to go right back in there and you need to give him a long, long speech.
I don't do secrets.
I don't do any of that 15-year-old, ooh,
I'm gonna tell you, but don't tell anyone else.
we're not talking about who made out with who at the Halloween dance.
this was a private family issue.
your dad's a drunk.
I had to start cleaning up my dad when I was 7.
that's when I turned into the grown-up of the family.
so you got to wait till you were 24.
good for you.
night, Bailey.
sit down. - What?
sit down! - You okay?
what do you care?
with your hair products and your perfect little face, perfect little life.
what do you care how I am?
my perfect little life? Have you been paying attention at all?
Yeah, I pay attention.
I pay attention.
I pay attention to people in all walks of life, all types.
I notice people.
I see people. It's guys like you who don't see people like me.
I don't see you?
clear. I'm not talking about you, shepherd.
just. guys like you who don't see girls like me.
we don't exist for you.
we exist to do homework.
we exist to build your ego up.
I am a successful married mother.
I am chief resident.
I am the chief resident of a major metropolitan hospital.
I'm a surgeon who saved his life today.
and he still doesn't see me.
I may as well still be that high school girl with the mushroom haircut and the coke bottle asses and the band uniform, the girl who didn't get to go to the homecoming dance 'cause it didn't even occur to him to ask me.
all those late nights tutoring him, and it didn't even occur to him to ask.
band uniform? Really?
do I look like I want to be mocked by you right now?
no, you don't.
I'm just gonna say one thing.
in high school, I was 110 pounds, and I hadn't yet figured out hair product, so I had a big afro, and, uh, I had acne.
and I, too, wore a band uniform.
sax.
oboe.
and I would've been honored... to take a girl like you to homecoming.
in some ways we grow up.
we have families.
we get married.
divorced.
I was trying to think of a long speech.
you know, like Bailey with the long speeches.
and then I just, just, everything I wanted to say to.
it, it just is, I can't talk to you.
I...that's why I talked to Meredith.
I just...I don't know why.
it used to be.
it used to be.
that I was the only person you could talk to, and you were the only person I could talk to.
I know.
I'm in love with this incredible guy, and we're having problems.
and my best friend, he would know what to say to me about it.
I need to be able to talk to my best friend.
I cannot get through this without my best friend.
why isn't this easier?
I don't know.
well, I want my best friend back.
me, too.
but for the most part, we still have the same problems that we did when we were 15.
Hey, Rose.
you know my name.
I had to ask around, but now I know.
well, good for you. Good night.
hang on. You know, I should've recognized you from the O. R. today.
we worked together for three hours, and it's thoughtless.
I've worked on 36 of your surgeries, and today was the first time we made eye contact.
like I said, hospital's no better than high school.
good night, Dr. Shepherd.
someone figured out how to get back on the horse.
what? No, no, no. I was just, uh, talking about work.
coulda fooled me.
Hey, dad. You want to get a drink?
doctors "s" and "s." How are we this evening?
Hiya, Sydney.
Derek, do you think I just could talk to you for one quick minute?
Yeah. Have a seat.
I'm a lot of woman.
okay? I bring home the bacon.
fry it up in a pan, serve it with eggs or on a sandwich or crumbled up in a cobb salad.
well, you do a lot with bacon.
not just bacon.
but, Derek, I bring a lot of things to the table.
and I'm looking for a man who can do the same, a man who can meet my needs, all my needs.
I just don't think you're ready.
well, you might be right.
well, I won't let this affect our work if you won't.
I won't.
no matter how much we grow taller.
grow older.
apparently I'm not good at meeting needs.
and I don't bring that much to the table.
I'm awkward and freaky.
we are still forever stumbling.
do you want to get out of here?
I do.
forever wondering.
forever.
young.
my mother called it the greatest and most terrifying moment in her life.
he said "Karev.
standing at the head of the surgical table, knowing that a patient's life depends on you and you alone...
he said "Karev. - " Yes!
are you sure? -Yeah.
you're "sure" sure?
it's what we all dream about.
because the first person that gets to fly solo in the O. R?
kind of a badass.
Stevens! He said "Stevens.
well, which is it, moron, Stevens or Karev?
this is stupid. You guys are gonna trust these imbeciles to tell you who's getting the solo surgery?
is this hard for you, being banned from the solo surgery?
it must be really hard for you.
Ooh, a mean streak. I like it.
he may change his mind. He's been known to change his mind.
please don't do that.
you guys go ahead and, uh, will yourselves to be voted in.
use "the secret.
Grey! Uh, the chief said "Grey.
what? Come on. This is bogus.
you're just figuring that out?
steve is not a lip-reader.
none of the interns are lip-readers.
you just have to wait for the attendings to vote just like we did when I won.
you won your solo surgery?
I'm just gonna pretend you didn't feel the need to ask me that question, Yang.
of course I won. I was good.
I didn't cut l-vad wires...
or put my hand in bomb-y body cavities or have my interns operating on themselves.
I was special.
I was young, gifted and black, and everybody knew it.
the attendings knew it. The chief knew it.
I didn't have to act like I could read lips.
just go about my work calmly, and waited for my name to get called.
okay. It's done.
Oh, whatever, Helen Keller.
no, I'm serious.
the chief sent me. They made their choice.
who is it?
it's you.
I am happy to announce that the first solo surgery will take place tonight
a below-the-knee amputation, bone cancer.
poor bastard. -Mr. Collinsworth in 2212.
no appy?
saw action. Sweet.
choosing who gets the first solo surgery isn't just about who has the best surgical skills or who's logged the most hours in the O. R.
it's about the highest form of trust
the trust to put a patient's life into one of our resident's hands.
and for the first time that I can recall, every single attending picked the same person.
Dr. Yang.
however, Dr. Yang is out of the running.
she is going to pick the winner instead.
Dr. Yang will post her decision on the O. R. Board at 4: 00 P. M.
also, since your interns are still banned from the O. R.
the winner will be allowed to pick a fellow resident to scrub in with them.
good luck.
this is torture for me.
I'm not even done.
sir? -Dr. Dixon's back.
you'll be spending the day with her. You will impress her.
and you will make sure this hospital impresses her.
by the end of the day, I want that woman to be my next head of cardio.
if she's not, I'll know who to blame.
we held a retractor for 12 hours together.
you said I had small hands, good for surgery. Remember?
no. Go away.
I operated on a heart in an elevator.
look, that was over a year ago.
O'malley's 007. Think how poor your decision would look if you gave it to him.
your turn.
I don't know why you guys are even bothering.
we all know who she's gonna pick.
she's not gonna pick me because I'm her best friend.
she's gonna pick me because I'm the best.
okay, stop.
are you guys kidding me?
fine. I'll think about it.
just... gonna do surgical things.
iz, are you coming? We gotta go to the clinic.
flu season fun.
Yeah.
I ...
will catch up with you.
me, too. -Shut up.
not you.
my head... shut up.
when I win, you can scrub in for me.
A-Alex, she's not... not gonna pick you.
I'll scrub in for you, too, if you win, which you won't, 'cause I will.
enough.
I-I gotta go.
Cristina still hasn't talked to me, which is normal, except it's worse.
two weeks suspension, and she hasn't even bothered to say one mean thing.
Karev called me a moron, which is good.
well, none of the residents even look at me.
the least they could do is hate us.
well, I'm gonna get some sex.
sex always makes me feel better.
don't look at me.
me either.
that makes three of us.
Hi.
I get it.
I'm the one who organized a crazy cabal of secret cutter interns.
the thing is, I've been advised to seek out sex as a way out of my sad predicament, but I think I would rather just learn today, so...
what do you say?
you, me-- why are you talking about sex to me?
it's inappropriate. I'm your teacher.
I have things to teach-- double board certified things.
no, that was always--that's what I was talking about, for--for you to teach me medicine.
the--the sex was that-- that was a joke.
Dr. Sloan.
um, I heard that you're performing a hypopharynx reconstruction today.
I'm gonna make a woman speak again. - Well, let's hope.
I read up on the surgery and-- you read up on my surgery?
since it's your first time performing what I understand to be a very cutting-edge surgery,
I was hoping you might need an extra set of hands.
fine. You can join Dr. Grey and me.
Dr. Grey who's been banned from the O. R?
she's on cappuccino duty, which, Dr. Grey, I'm still waiting for.
right away. Thank you.
Dr. Virginia Dixon. It says she arrived over half an hour ago.
where is she?
nervous? -What? What are you doing here?
this is the cardio wing. Only cardio gods allowed.
I know. I was just looking around, getting to know other parts of the hospital.
what else is there?
the O. R. The E. R. And the place with the food.
somebody's got a lot to learn.
a laryngectomy five years ago resulted in the loss of her ability to speak.
Kathleen's undergone several surgical attempts to restore her voice in the pt five years, none have been successful.
Oh, oh, this time, though, this time, uh, we have a good feeling about this.
right honey?
as discussed, I'll get the blood supply from your arm and the cartilage...
from your...
honey?
honey.
you can talk to me.
I'll get the skin and the blood supply from her arm and the cartilage from her nose to construct a makeshift speaking tube, which will bome her new voice box.
now you should aware there's a chance the procedure might not work.
he's clear on that.
I'm just reminding him not to get his hopes up.
any other questions I can answer?
Kathleen? Honey?
tell me everything there is to know about Karev.
Why? - I'm his intern.
he seems cool enough at your house, though whatever he's got going with the girl who masturbates all the time
I don't like to judge-- but still, officially, I'm his intern.
so what's his deal?
Sadie, I can't be your friend in here. I mean, I'm a resident, and you're an intern.
you're gonna have to figure out how not to piss off Alex Karev yourself.
okay. I get it. -Good.
it wasn't my fault.
I had to tell John and those guys where to meet us.
I said I would do it, that way you could drive.
I'm telling mom and dad. - I'll kill you.
girls, you need to calm down.
tell her! -Shut up!
what happened? -Sists, 16 and 15, crashed their dad's car, and that's all we know since they won't stop screaming at each other.
we need your names, now.
don't tell her. Don't you say a word.
her name is Holly Anderson. She was driving and texting while driving.
is there a police officer here? I would like to press charges.
Oh, you suck-up! You suck-up ass face!
we need your number so we can call your parents.
here. I speed-dialed my dad.
you're such a bitch. - No, you are.
no wonder all the boys in school hate you. - Make it stop.
shut up!
you are dead when mom and dad show up.
the doctors are just gonna have to save you again.
I hate you. - I hate you more.
I hate you both.
I know you still see me as 007, but that was day one.
I've grown a lot since then and learned a lot.
you know, anyone can...
can have brains or anyone can have talent, but the key is to grow.
so sure, I had a rough start and I had to redo some of my intern year, but, you know, I came out the other side, smarter, better.
the important point is I never gave up, because I'm a fighter.
thank you.
okay, Emma, I'm gonna have to check your x-rays, but I think your leg's broken.
you're gonna be off it for a while.
no. No!
I can't miss my future leaders of America conference.
Holly! - Emma, I'm gonna be grounded till graduation.
I was going to D. C.
I've been waiting for this for a year.
mom and dad spent 2 grand. No, they've now wasted 2 grand.
God, you stupid baby! - Hey, all right. You know, I'm separating you two.
listen, I've been here, lots.
your dad won be as pissed as you think. He'll just be happy that you're safe.
he'll kill me. He'll take away everything.
how long have her eyes been like that?
her eyes? What-- page Shepherd.
tell him she might have a basilar skull fracture. Let's get her up to C. T. Now.
I didn't see. I'm sorry. - You can do scut.
I'll call you when she needs another pep talk.
where is she going?
just to run a few tests. - Good!
get her out of here! Take her away!
I hope you die!
Oh, crap.
somebody's in big trouble.
did you forget to open it or did you forget to staff it?
both.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody.
I will be right back with the keys.
might want to get some nurses while you're at it.
so does this happen a lot?
cause if it does, you're kinda giving my clinic a bad name.
you're mocking me now?
sweet. Very sweet.
Dr. Dixon, there you are. I'm Dr. Yang.
great.
well, I've been assigned to work with you today.
I was in the cardio lab looking for you. I'm so sorry it took me so long.
there's a blank spot on this board. There's a surgery but no surgeon.
I would like to do a surgery, but it's an amputation.
I haven't done an amputation since my residency.
well, um...
that's...
it's really hard to...
um, that...
is your stuttering pathological and persistent or is it occasional and stress related?
I don'T... stutter.
I had persistent pathological stuttering as a child, but it can be treated with rigorous speech therapy.
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
why is this slot on the board blank?
I need to select one of my fellow residents for that slot.
it's the first solo surgery of my class.
the chief asked you to choose from your peers?
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Patterson.
I have some forms for your wife to fill out. Is now a good time?
she's a blogger... about cancer and voicelessness.
she's famous in certain internet circles.
well, it seems like you two have a-a pretty great system going here.
I--you've learned to communicate.
Oh, you mean the post-its?
you think that's a pretty great system?
I--it'S... convenient.
Yes, no, hello, I love you..."
you read the words long enough, they begin to lose their meaning.
mid-shaft transverse tibia fracture?
Hi. Sorry to barge in.
I was, uh, I was just walking by, and I saw broken bones, and I love broken bones.
less than 5 degrees of angulation, right?
Yeah. It, uh...
uh, we can treat it with closed reduction and casting.
flexion-extension views of the cervical spine?
Yes.
uh, I-I sh--I should go see my patient.
that's a chair.
looks like a hemopericardium. Let cardio know.
Hey, I've got a future leader outside. She needs a C. T.
Oh, I'm not mad at you for not voting for me.
it would've looked like you were playing favorites.
good. You deserve it. Cristina knows that, even you two are fighting.
you and Yang are fighting?
we're not fighting. Fought--past tense.
how bad is it? Real bad?
she's crashing.
there's brain matter in the blood. Let an O. R. Know we're coming and page cardio.
what happened to her?
what did you do to my sister? Holly!
Holly! What did you do to her?
so... you know I deserve this.
you know I'm the most qualified.
but I don't want it to be a big, awkward thing. I don'T.
so just, you know, you do what you have to do.
okay.
okay.
I'll see you later.
we're almost done here, Emma.
Holly, will be all right, right?
she's gonna be okay?
well, she got into surgery very quick, so that's good.
are my parents here yet? -They're--they're coming.
your dad's-- but Holly is gonna be all right, right?
uh, she's not in-- in, like-- she won't die?
Emma, you didn't mean it.
I said, "I hope you die.
that can't be the last thing she heard me say. It can'T.
just don't let her die please.
all right, I'll go to the O. R. And get an update for you.
okay. - Okay.
be objective, Yang.
consider accomplishments, achievements, look for the standouts.
right now, let's see what kind of standout Dr. Karev proves himself to be when I ask him to sew the graft.
Really? - Absolutely.
Dr. Yang, watch Karev to see if his skills are up to par for the solo.
a system. Devise a system.
rank everyone accordingly. That's all.
thank you.
out of the way. What just happened?
her brain is changing color.
get outta the way. Get outta the way. She's hemorrhaging.
push 100 of mannitol. - What did I do?
what did I do?
oy, okay. So the new intern, Meredith's friend
the psycho with no appendix? - Yeah.
we talked.
I mean, she came and talked to me, but it was, like--it was more than that, you know?
a guy looks at you a certain way, you know, his eyes wander when he talks to you, and bang, you just know.
but this whole girl thing, it's so confusing.
well, was there touching? - No.
was there playing with the hair? - No.
was there licking of the lips? - Oh, my god.
I made it up.
I made it up because I'm lonely and depressed and desperate for attention from the hot new intern.
crazy new intern.
crazy, hot-- no!
the hot ones are the ones that cause trouble the ones that distract you from realizing your true potential.
you need to focus on the medicine.
take all that pent up sexual energy you'd waste thinking about hot, young, naked available interns, and put it back into your genius...
right. -Your godliness.
build someone an organ.
that's hot.
she smiled. Did I mention she smiled?
no hot interns!
and then we'll insert the newly constructed tube in between her trachea and esophagus just...
like...
that.
so this valve right here flips open when she has air in the trachea
you're in my space. Back up.
just back the hell up.
Dr. Bailey, will you please find Dr. Grey something to do other than interfere?
uh, Dr. Grey, finish prepping Mrs. Patterson for surgery.
she was in my space.
George, can you cover for me for a little while?
where are you going? We're swamped.
uh, there's something that I need to do. It pressing, okay?
it's the hot sex. She doesn't want to miss out on the hot, hot sex.
Izzie-- it's the clinic, George.
you can handle the clinic.
you're lucky she even showed up. She hasn't been here all week.
Dr. Shepherd-- it wasn't you.
she had a carotid dissection. Nothing you could've done.
so we can't just-- she had a massive C.V.A.
the blood supply to her brain was cut off and cannot be restored.
so even though Dr. Shepherd was able to fix the hole in her brain that allowed the brain tissue to leak through her nose, the subsequent carotid dissection has caused loss of her cerebral function.
you do understand that?
she's brain dead. I get it.
she's only 16.
that's good news.
she'll be an excellent candidate for organ donation.
excellent candidate. Excellent organs. Young.
dude...
you were robbed.
you got screwed by politics.
the chief, he needed a scapegoat. It's so unfair.
I'm sorry.
I-I can't do this. I-I-I can kiss ass when I have to, but not yours.
below-the-knee amputation-- make a transverse incision at the mid-shaft of the tibia, elevate the peosteum and cut the tibia and fibula with a bone saw, ligate the vascular bundles and release the tourniquet.
I've done four of 'em-- one on a cadaver, three on Stan.
you know who you're gonna pick?
well, I'm ranking them according to a system.
you know, surgical skills, hours in the O. R. Published papers, academic accomplishments
you know them. You know their capabilities. Go with your gut.
my gut?
I'm not putting a patient's life in the hands of a novice surgeon based on my gut.
it worked for me. - Your gut?
it's what told me to choose you.
beautiful. - What?
your necklace.
right.
I have to go.
see ya.
I hope you didn't page me to help you pass out cough drops, 'cause it ain't gonna happen.
Where's Izzie?
how should I know? I thought she was here.
she's avoiding me. She won't answer my pages.
so what do you want me to do about it?
well, you guys are together now, right?
so why don't you talk to her and find out why she couldn't care less about her own clinic?
you're just pissed she's not here 'cause you can't handle a few cases of the flu.
something's wrong, Alex.
you need to talk to her. She won't talk to me.
don't ever talk to me about Izzie again.
it's just George.
your friends, though, you know, they're out there fight for a chance to chop off that guy's leg.
wh-what is that anyway?
it's how we learn, by doing.
and I lost my shot at the solo surgery as soon as the chief made it Cristina's decision.
Anyway,there will always be surgeries.
there won't always be fiancÃ© who come back from the dead.
good point.
aren't you going to epithelialize here to connect it to the trachea?
you're a very eager student, Dr. Bailey, very thorough.
anyway I can be of service.
I'm not sorry.
what?
for what we did.
it was extreme, maybe even stupid, but this program?
I mean, you should be down in that O. R. Not up here in t nosebleeds, and I shouldn't be spending my entire day transcribing all of Karev's charts because his handwriting's illegible.
I mean, how is that teaching?
so they can call me crazy Sadie and god knows what other names, but that doesn't change the fact that this program is broken.
I mean, the only time they ever bother with us is if they think they can get us in bed.
that's not true.
Dr. Sloan took the time to teach me today, and that was not about sex.
he likes you.
who? Dr. Sloan?
Oh, don't tell me you haven't noticed his eyes on your ass.
you are delusional.
is he cutting into her throat?
bloody hell.
so I suppose you'll use a strip test to confirm flow across the anastomosis?
that can damage the endothelium.
Oh, but don't you need to confirm
Dr. Bailey, would you rather do Mrs. Patterson's surgery yourself?
I can leave. - Dr. Sloan, I w-- I wasn'T...
questioning your surgical skills. I was just trying to learn...
something exciting, something new.
I mean, these residents are running around fighting tooth and nail for a chance to get to cut off a leg.
And...look what you've done here.
you've--you've made something where there was nothing, and it's thrilling.
I-I was just trying to learn.
thank you, Dr. Bailey.
now would you take the flap veins and join them to the internal jugular, please?
excuse me.
she looks like she's sleeping.
can I touch her?
Yes, of course.
can she hear me?
she can come out of it, right...
the coma? People can do that?
no, she can'T.
I'm very sorry for your loss, but tests confirm that although your sister's bodily functions are fine, her brain is dead. She has no thoughts, no emotions, no senses.
I'm Dr. Dixon.
I will be harvesting your sister's organs if your parents agree.
please, she's our baby. We need more time.
I'm very sorry for your loss, but her organs are young and vital.
they could save many lives.
wake up, Holly.
wake up. Come on. Wakeup. Wake up. Wake up.
I'm very sorry for your loss, but your sister can't wake up.
her basic function gone.
her brain is dead. Her body is alive, but unfortunately-- unfortunately, she is dead.
get out!
you cannot have her, and you cannot take her.
Dr. Dixon, uh, I think-- I think they understand.
I think you should go now, please.
I have offended you, but we are running out of time.
get out!
Holly! Wake up!
wake up, Holly! Holly, wake up!
Holly, wake up, please!
have you ever had mind-blowing sex...
the kind of sex that makes you want to die, just fall on the floor and give up and die?
cause this sex I'm having, it's that good.
it's the best sex I've ever had.
in fact, it's the best sex anybody's ever had.
I don't know why anybody who's had this kind of sex would do anything but have sex.
you're gonna give the solo surgery to Mer, which is typical and boring and slightly corrupt, but at least I'm having, really, really...
really good sex.
Yeah, I just thought now
I know you're nervous, and it may feel a little strange at first, but just give it a shot.
you haven't forgotten.
come on. You can do it.
No! No! No more!
no more typing!
no more post-its! No!
talk to me.
talk to me, damn it!
talk to me!
okay, maybe we should give her a lite time.
um, sir, maybe you should go, too.
just go for a-a walk or a drive. Just give her some space.
I've given her five years of space.
it was my fault.
excuse me?
what happened, the, um, the appy, it was--it was my fault.
I knew what I was doing, so if you want to punish someone, punish me, not Dr. Yang.
you know who your father is, and you know he's why you're still here.
so if I were you, I'd stop worrying about whose fault the appy was and start figuring out what I was gonna do to make up for it.
Yes, sir.
thank you, sir.
there are people dying. Right now, there are people dying.
it's inappropriate.
I'm sorry. It's almost 4: 00, and I have to-- I have to make this decision.
no, no, I'm not talking about your system.
I approve of your system. I was talking about the brain dead girl.
she can't hear her sister. She can't feel her hands.
there are patients dying right now, and those organs would keep them alive.
leave feelings out of it-- leave them out of the science, leave them out of the decision making
because people are dying as we speak.
is she kidding?
Congratulations.
whatever.
interesting choice, Yang.
he made the best case.
Iz. I won.
what time is it?
Yang--she picked me for the solo surgery.
she did?
that's amazing.
I love you.
what?
I love you.
I friggin' love you.
I just got the solo surgery, and the first thing I did was look for you, and you weren't there.
you're never there anymore.
and I've been thinking about it, and I-I think it might be 'cause you love me, too, and 'cause you're scared of that...
and 'cause I-I screwed it up last time and 'cause Denny died and
Alex - just listen.
you had that heart patient, and it reminded you of Denny and how bad you felt when you were lying on that bathroom floor.
I get that.
I get that you're scared.
but you're not gonna have to feel like that again, 'cause I'm not gonna die, Iz.
and I'm not gonna cheat on you and I--I'm not gonna go anywhere...
cause...
I think you're my best shot at...
I think with you, you make me better.
you make me want to be better.
you make me want to be good.
and I think I can. With you, I think I can.
so I'm not going anywhere, and you can stop hiding.
and if you want to be scared, that's okay.
just be scared with me.
be scared while you scrub in with me for my first solo surgery.
okay?
you love me.
shut up.
I'm really starting to not like that guy.
I never should've said it.
I didn't mean it.
I never should've said it.
tell her that.
tell her the last thing you'd want her to hear.
because you have to believe that if it were you in this bed and Holly was sitting with you feeling this bad, you would forgive her.
tell her.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I love you.
she loved you, too.
no matter what you said, no matter what happened between the two of you, she loved you. She loves you.
she loves you.
so you were...
right.
Cristina and I are fighting.
you should go, talk to her.
she's your best friend.
it's important.
they don't tell you when you become a doctor it's gonna be like this.
they don't tell you that you're gonna...lose more patients than you save.
16
I'm sick of the death.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you at home. - Okay.
it's okay.
nobody else is here. 'S just me, and I'm just an intern.
I'm nobody.
so you can try. And--and if it doesn't work, it's okay.
just--just try.
Dr. Dixon.
how has your day been?
you feel like you may have a home here at Seattle Grace?
Dr. Yang-- you tortured her today.
making her choose among her peers, some kind of emotional torture, was that your intention?
uh, yes.
have your board make me a better offer.
we're fighting, and I don't want to be.
let's just put this past us.
what happened with the chief and interns, it doesn't matter.
I know that's why you didn't choose me, and I know that's why you made it personal, so let's just move on.
you made it personal.
this, right here, is you making it personal.
you told me to do what I had to do, so I chose Alex.
he was the most prepared.
that's why I didn't choose you-- not because we're fighting, but because...
unlike you, I can separate my personal life from my job.
you made it personal.
none of you said anything.
those were alour interns.
but I won this.
they picked me.
if I don't deserve this solo surgery, then none of us do.
I don't know if I'm more jealous of Alex or worried about Izzie.
I think there's something wrong with her, Mer.
there's something wrong with all of us, George.
that's Alex.
not here.
here.
you paged?
Yeah. I need you to scrub in with me.
Where's Izzie? - I'm freakin' out.
I'm freakin' out.
I told her I love her.
I told her I love her before a solo surgery.
I can't believe that. Who does that?
and now she's not gonna show up, and I'm freakin' out.
stop. Stop freaking out.
if you screw this up and kill this guy, I'm gonna be pissed.
then I'll know I should've won it.
you have to kick ass in there, Alex.
you have no choice.
big night, Karev. You ready?
you ready?
he's ready.
where are we going?
don't worry. You'll like it.
come on.
wait. Just wait.
wait.
it's the vent.
it clears your head. It feels better, right?
Yes. Yeah.
it's out of time, out of space.
anything can happen in the vent.
anything.
like what?
just wait.
you made her speak.
Mrs. Patterson-- she said "hi." She spoke.
you--you made her speak.
I respect you.
as a man...
a-as a surgeon, as a teacher, I respect you.
so...
teach me.
what are you doing? Don't do that.
stop.
teach me.
stop.
teach me. - We can't do this.
you're little Grey, and--and--and I promised, and I'm your teacher.
so...
teach me. - Ah, Lexie...
teach me.
teach me.
come on. Am I really so bad no. I am.
we enter the world alone and we leave it alone.
and everything that happens in between?
we owe it to ourselves to find a little company.
$50 says he calls on the chief in the first 10 minutes.
$100 he chokes before they turn on the saw.
Hey, that's one of us down there.
show some respect.
we need help, we need support.
otherwise we're in it by ourselves...
strangers...
cut off from each other.
and we forget...
just how connected we all are.
so instead, we choose love...
we choose life...
and for a moment...
we feel just a little bit less alone.
10-blade.
as if figuring it out will somehow cushion the blow.
but the future is always changing.
got one more.
he's a doctor. He says he needs to do it today.
come in.
the future is the home of our deepest fears...
Owen?
Hi, mom.
I'm home.
and our wildest hopes.
but one thing is certain...
when it finally reveals itself...
congratulations, doctor.
welcome to the army.
the future...
thank you.
is never the way we imagined it.
doctors spend a lot of time
focused on the future...
planning it...
working toward it.
but at some point, you start to realize,
your life is happening now...
any changes overnight?
no.
not after med school, not after residency,
right now.
this is it. It's here.
blink and you'll miss it.
Oh, it's the chief. Somebody better make a coffee run.
you all look like hell.
I gotta be in surgery in ten minutes.
um, Mer, will you let me know?
Yeah.
we should go, too. It's probably gonna be a while.
shepherd said she'd wake up in the morning.
what did he tell you? Was that all crap?
what did he say?
he said it may be a while.
she's gonna wake up.
Stevens still isn't awake.
and I'm having something of a day even aside from that.
so... don't take my face personally.
it's just my face today. - Did you tell her?
uh, you should tell her,
and don't take her face personally.
on behalf of the department of pediatric surgery,
I'd like to welcome you to the fellowship program.
you're in! We're gonna get you a pair of wheelie sneaks.
Congratulations.
all right.
I know I didn't support you during this process.
in any event, I am behind you now.
I'm trying to be a big person here.
how about you meet me halfway?
wake up. Wake up.
wake up. Wake up.
wake up. Wake up.
I have a headache.
you're up?
you're up and you're talking.
you talked, right?
talk!
Ow. I said I have a headache. Stop yelling.
page Shepherd!
Ow. I'm sorry.
Hey, what's with hugging O'malley?
I slept, Cristina.
last night, I slept for the first time in...
I slept.
and, uh, I don't know,
hugging O'malley because you slept?
no, I hugged O'malley 'cause he's got great news,
which I'll let him tell you, but, yeah, I... I guess,
Yeah, maybe I hugged him because I slept.
and that's because of you,
because you came with me to see my mom,
and then I slept, and I slept without nightmares.
that's not a small thing, Cristina.
that... that is everything.
I can be a better man.
I can be a better man for you, and if...
I hope, you know, if you'll let me,
I can be a better man with you.
no, don't say anything.
just... just think about it, okay? Okay?
Dr. Bailey, I need to tell you something.
Oh, not now, O'malley.
I know. It'll be quick 'cause I gotta
get to the O.R. to scrub in with the chief.
now I think you're gonna be mad at first,
but I'm about to do something important,
and I'm very sure about this decision,
and I-I think eventually, you're gonna be proud.
but, you know, before that,
you're probably gonna be like...
what did you do?!
I'm... I don't mean to imitate you...
you call that quick?
I joined the army to be a trauma surgeon.
I report for duty tomorrow.
you did what?!
Yeah, that's where I thought we'd start.
you know, something's going on with George.
what?
Owen hugged him. They were happy.
well, we don't hug when we're happy.
are you better?
what?
you know, with your therapy. Uh, whatever.
you said you got well. Well, are you... better?
or are you just, you know, fake better?
what do you mean?
I'm asking you if people, you know...
I mean, are you actually different?
I mean, do you feel different?
I'm getting married today. Mm-hmm. City hall.
no muss, no fuss. Just quick and dirty.
well, uh... do you want me to come?
no, no. Just letting you know.
Oh, no, wait. Uh, uh...
okay, this is my grocery list.
it's old. Uh, this...this is new.
um, this is my favorite pen, so I want it back. Borrowed.
and all of it's blue, so you're covered.
now see, if we were George and owen,
we would hug right now.
dude.
unidentified male, dragged by a bus.
he's clamped down, so we couldn't intubate.
didn't they stop when they hit him?
bus driver didn't know he was there
until he got halfway down the block.
Oh, is he gonna be okay?
okay, I'll take over C. P.R.
push 20 etomidate and 100 of sux.
he saved my life.
the bus was gonna hit me. He threw me out of the way.
Grey, get her out of here.
it was supposed to be me under the bus.
he's all alone.
they don't even know who he is. Please.
all right, stand over there and just don't move.
he's back. Okay, let's get a trauma series,
trauma labs and o-neg blood in here.
severe avulsion injury to the left forearm.
whoa. Okay, his skull is bashed in.
page Shepherd. And Sloan.
start antibiotics and start cleaning out those wounds.
now can you get her out of here?
did you get the whole thing?
did you get the whole tumor out?
just let me finish my exam.
can you tell me your name?
my name is isobel Stevens. It's 2009.
and I'm in the... neuro I. C.U. At Seattle Grace hospital.
did you get the damn thing out?
got the whole damn thing.
you got it? Yeah.
Oh, god. You got the whole thing.
and I can talk and I know my name - And I'm not a turnip. - Nope.
no offense. Oh, no.
you are a great surgeon, but I really thought
I was gonna be a turnip.
this is so unbelievably great.
your kidneys are a little sluggish,
so we're just gonna keep an eye on your electrolytes for a few hours.
your post-op crit was... was fine. - Okay, good. Good.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the brain tumor? Did you get it out?
iz, you just asked him that.
we just talked about it.
no, no, it's okay. She's gonna be foggy for a while.
the tumor's out.
there was a little bleeding during the post...
you got it? - Yeah.
all of it?
that's amazing.
Derek Shepherd, you are a hero.
and I know that that's Derek Shepherd.
and you're Alex. And you should kiss me.
Alex...
I don't have a brain tumor.
I'm tumor-free.
Yes, you are.
what's wrong? Why do you look weird?
no, nothing. Nothing.
uh, your kidneys are a little slow.
we're just gonna watch them.
okay. So you'll just recheck my electrolytes in an hour?
okay.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the tumor?
we did.
the tumor's gone.
there was a little bit of bleeding,
and we took care of that.
you got it?
Oh, my god.
and I can talk, and you didn't kill me.
what's wrong with you people? We should be celebrating.
she's like the woman who couldn't remember her husband was dead.
we had to keep telling her every five minutes.
could be a perfectly normal post-operative haze.
or the bleeding during the procedure blitzed her short-term retention.
did you screw up her brain? - Karev...
I'll be back. Try and stay calm.
freaking her out is not gonna help.
wake up.
man versus bus. - The bus won.
check out the left arm.
he's crashing again!
what do we got? - We got roadkill.
you mind? He stepped out in front of a moving bus
so he could pull a woman out of the way. He's a hero.
can you fix the arm? - Fingers are already blue.
if it's gonna happen, it's gotta be in the next few hours.
pupil's blown. Stop C. P.R.
okay, give me a cranial drill, please.
Grey, want to practice your burr holes?
stabilize his neck, please, nurse.
okay, hand her the drill.
okay, go in slowly. When you feel it grab, stop, 'Cause otherwise you're gonna be hitting the brain.
okay, let's go. Quickly.
right there!
pull back, pull back! That's it.
nice work, Dr. Grey.
I'm gonna go get some bacitracin for that face.
all right. Let's get his head rotated. Easy.
welcome back, sir.
you had us worried there for a minute.
you think he's gonna make it?
I hope so.
he really has to make it.
Dr. Sloan.
there's gonna be too much tension.
start over and do a layered closure.
can I ask a question about that?
okay. You brought up moving in together
and marriage, and I put it off.
and now you're embarrassed
and you won't make eye contact with me because
you feel that I have all the power in the relationship,
but I don't want all the power in the relationship.
I...I'm happy to share it. Can we just skip this part?
get some 4-0 vicryl so you can redo your patient's sutures.
I'll totally pretend I didn't hear any of that.
women do this to me.
I don't do this. "Let's get a house together."
sucks being the girl, huh?
I'm not the girl.
what do girls do?
well, we start with the cold shoulder,
so you're right on track.
and we go to our girlfriends and we bitch,
and our girlfriends say, "you want to build a future, "build it yourself.
you don't need a man to give you that.
so you want to buy a house?
just buy a house.
you're good at this.
I ought to help someone get a love life.
I suck at my own.
he jumped in front of a bus... for me.
what did you do to O'malley? - Excuse me?
uh, somebody else around here likely to convince someone
to join the army and be a trauma surgeon in Iraq?
What?! The army?!
what?
v-fib. Charge the paddles to 360.
just call who you have to call and undo this.
Dr. Bailey, little busy here.
clear. - George? George O'malley?
it wasn't my idea. - No change.
charge again. - Clear.
I did what I could to give him a decent education in trauma.
I didn't know he was gonna go and enlist.
he keeps coding. - Here's why...
open-book pelvic fracture.
there's too much bleeding.
we take him to an O. R. Now, he'll die on the table.
he needs to go to angio if we're gonna stop - The pelvic arterial bleeding. - Sinus tach. We have a rhythm.
it's barely there, but it's there. - Let's stabilize the pelvis.
I know what goes on in this hospital.
I know you're messed up from that war,
and not in a small way. Get him out of it.
page me if you need me. I've got other patients.
how'd you piss off all the women?
um, let's get our guy to angio.
angio? He's barely got a pulse.
it's now or never if we want him to live.
let's move.
sir, I know it's tough,
but I'd personally be very grateful
if you'd try and stay alive for the next few minutes.
maybe we're bouncier in peds than in general surgery,
but I thought that there would be a "yay"
or some jumping around.
cause you look pretty dour for someone
who's about to start a highly prized fellowship.
you are about to start a highly prized fellowship, right?
Hey, I've got a plan to stop George. Are you in?
stop George from what?
he joined the army. Yes, I'm in.
Bailey, I'm talking to you.
why are you trying to stop him?
because he joined the army. - And?
and because he's my ex-husband,
and I know his mom and I love his mom,
and normally Izzie would talk sense into him,
but she's got cancer and kind of a bad mental deficit,
so it's on me to stop him.
but why would you want to stop him?
because he joined the army.
don't you think that's a problem?
I think that's awesome.
awesome?
you gonna chew?
my dragged-under-a-bus guy's in angio,
and they're gonna page me any minute.
how's Izzie? Is she reiterating anything?
no.
OK. At 6: 00 P. M. your idiotic collegue
george O'malley would finish his surgery with the chief.
and at 6 P. M. you will be standing beside this in the O. R. hallway
prepared to join an intervention.
what? Polite company might call it intervention
though I'm not sure interventions
involve whooping people on the behind with a belt.
what, he's got a drinking problem now? - He joined the army.
What?! 007? He can't go to army.
he's the guy that gets killed.
he's that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun.
grey is going to coax him back as a loving friend.
you are going to use logic and reason
to point out the idiocy of his ways.
Stevens will make sad cancer eyes.
and if all of that doesn't work, Karev, you're gonna pull out
your "I was raised out back with the trash cans" roots - And just beat the crap out of him. - 6: 00.
1899/12/31 0: 06: 00
hey there.
I know this must be scary, but if it's any consolation,
you're a hard-core hero.
you saved that woman's life.
I-is he trying to write something?
can you hold this?
Oh, okay.
you'll be stronger tomorrow.
call O. R. One. Tell 'em to get ready for him.
Amanda, you can't be out here.
would you want to be all alone at a time like this?
we had 30 seconds of interaction
before he saved my life,
and... and I wasn't even nice.
I was standing on a corner when this...
ordinary-looking guy stands next to me and smiles,
and... and I'm so busy
scoping for someone hotter that...
I don't even give him a second look.
and next thing I know, he throws me
out of the way of a bus I'm about to walk in front of
and almost gets himself killed.
he literally... he swept me off my feet.
that is my prince in that bed.
okay, you can stay until they take him to surgery.
uh, not a good time. You know what? You walk away from me again,
I swear I will grab you by the hair and pull hard.
I grew up with the name Arizona.
I learned how to play dirty on the playground.
I stuck my neck out for you. You were my pick.
and I appreciate that, but it's a big decision.
it's not, frankly. It's the brass ring.
it's the most exclusive, it's the most competitive,
and we're as good as it gets.
nobody lands this thing and says no.
my husband informed me yesterday
that if I accept the peds fellowship,
if I sign on for another two years of training
and the hours and the workload that come with it
when I could be a general surgery attending
and make it home for dinner,
he will divorce me.
it's a big decision.
you're gonna have a hard time saving that arm.
I can get him back to full function
if I can get there in time.
I'm thinking about buying a house. - Good for you.
Meredith and I are gonna go to city hall this afternoon.
we're getting married. - Really?
Mm-hmm.
that's great news. - I know.
if I could just save Stevens...
you're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to get married.
you've earned that right.
congratulations, you lucky bastard.
come here. Give me a hug.
why is everyone hugging today?
Oh, the blushing bride.
all right, here is the plan for our john doe.
shepherd, you'll evacuate the epidural.
grey and I will correct the internal injuries.
that'll make room for Torres to place the internal fixator.
Sloan, you should still have time to work on the arm
if the patient doesn't get too acidotic or hypothermic.
do you think he has a shot?
I've seen people come back from worse.
Hey, I thought you were in surgery.
I'm on my way. Have you talked to Bailey
about this peds and Tucker thing?
no, I talked to Bailey about the army thing and George.
are you upset with me?
no, I'm awesome.
you said it was awesome.
George...sweet, kind George who can't even kill a fly...
is joining the army to go to Iraq
in the middle of a war, and you said "awesome."
it is awesome.
no, it is not awesome. God! Who are you?
how's the arm? - The nerves are still intact.
just have to reattach the vessels. - You ready for me?
I'm almost done with the major internal crush injuries.
pelvis will be all yours in a minute.
give me some more laps, please.
you think you could do it?
step in front of a bus for a perfect stranger?
we'd all like to think we would, but...
that's more or less major Hunt's been doing
every day for the last couple of years. Oh, no, the guys did.
I just came in behind 'em
with a dustpan and a broom and swept up.
you sewed up soldiers under fire.
you didn't sweep up.
how do you think O'malley is gonna do over there?
you think...you think he can handle it? - No, I don't.
I think he's gonna surprise us all.
I think he's coming back in a body bag.
I think you all should just shut up.
just shut the hell up.
please. Shut up.
shepherd got your whole tumor out.
Oh, my god.
Alex, why didn't you tell me? Oh, my god.
but we're working on it.
you remember what time you woke up this morning?
um, not exactly.
7: 45. "O'malley joined the army"?
what? - Yeah, he's gonna be a trauma surgeon in iraq.
When'd you wake up?
7: 45. He's gonna get killed. - Yeah, we're dealing with it.
did you know about this George thing?
Yep. Canon fodder.
I'm just gonna take some more blood.
last time we checked, your potassium was 6. 3.
When'd you wake up? - Um, early. I can't quite remember. I...
O'malley joined the army"? George?
we're dealing with it.
what's your potassium?
uh, I...
iz, what's your potassium? - You know what?
why don't we just give her the chart to read
and try and memorize, okay?
and I can talk to you about her hyperkalemia.
look, she just had brain surgery
and an incredibly aggressive course of I. L.-2.
she needs rest.
she needs to exercise whatever memory she's got left
before it all turns to mush.
well, she's not gonna heal
with you barking orders at her like a caveman.
butt out, Yang.
no, she's my patient. I don't care if you're her husband.
look, she... you want to see how fast I can get your visiting hours - Down to zero? - She signed a d. N.R. She signed a frigging d. N.R.
and made me promise she'd come outta this with a life.
not in a hospital bed, not with no brain,
I had to promise she'd have a life.
you want to know what happens
if she can't make any new memories?
forget about being a doctor.
she's gonna need round-the-clock babysitters.
we get an apartment together, and she can't ever
find her way to the damn toilet.
tracker on her ankle in case, god forbid, - She wanders out the front door! - Alex, you can handle this.
she will get better.
maybe. Maybe not. It's on me.
her future is on me.
is he gonna be okay?
we'll know more in the morning.
go ahead.
how's she doing? Any better?
no. -Damn.
well, I'm going to city hall
to go do the thing.
Seriously? It doesn't seem like the day for it.
look at Alex.
he's in there working so hard all day,
and she doesn't know.
and if she stays like this,
she may never know how much he loves her.
and that girl Amanda...
she's in there loving a stranger.
she thinks that's her prince charming. Mm.
I mean, he's probably gonna die today, chances are.
so yeah, I'm gonna go get married.
because I think it's important to take the time
to tell the people you love how much you love them
while they can hear you.
I love you, Cristina Yang.
you have changed.
Mm. Maybe I have.
what?
I'm gonna hug you.
maybe I don't understand people,
I don't see things.
so maybe I just don't get
what's going on with you or why you're so mad,
but I do think it's awesome.
I think that George joining the army is awesome. Um, shut up.
um, no. You asked me who I was.
I am a person who thinks that what George is doing
is dangerous and terrifying and brave.
he's going to serve his country.
he's going to risk his life to save the men and women
who make it possible for you and i to sleep safely in our beds.
I'm a person who thinks that that is brave.
and I am a person who stood in an airplane hanger
and watched them unload my brother's body in a coffin...
and all we got was a flag.
my brother died over there
because there weren't enough doctors, Callie.
so for my money, George O'malley is a patriot.
he's a hero,
and I am grateful that he exists.
so yeah, the word I use is "awesome."
that's who I am.
I'm sorry.
sorry, I-I didn't realize...
Oh, no, no, wait.
I... love...You.
well, I-I-I love you, too.
no, just...
I love you.
I said... I said "I love you.
me.
Cristina Yang.
you traumatized me.
and you know that I am s... I am so sorry about...
Oh, no, damn it. Not about the choking.
it's... It's like you come here and then you pull out my icicle
and you make me love you, and I can't...
I mean, I don't want to...
I-I can't breathe...
without you.
you can do this. Cristina, we can do this.
all you have to do is just meet me halfway.
all you have to do is say yes.
all you have to do is say yes.
what's your crit?
this is disgusting.
I can't believe we serve it to the patients.
you keep asking for lime jell-o
and don't like it.
so stop giving it to me.
you get mad if I don't.
okay, now what's your crit?
I don't know. I'm tired.
what's O'malley doing tomorrow?
joining the army.
Yeah. I need a break.
you don't think I need a break? Suck it up.
What...god.
back off.
I'm sorry if this is hard for you,
but you are not the one
with the short-term memory of a carrot.
Hey. Go ahead. Get it off your chest.
it's not like I'm gonna remember in five minutes.
okay, I'm not the one with a carrot for a brain but I'm married to it 'cause of some crock of a wedding we walked into, and only because The two of us thought you'd be dead within a week.
you made me promise you that you wouldn't live like this.
so now what the hell am I supposed to do,
smother you with a pillow,
shoot you up with a-an overdose of morphine?
not really psyched about that. Leave you?
not really psyched about that either.
so I guess I'm kinda screwed, right?
I mean, not as bad as you,
but not a frigging walk in the park, either.
I'm sorry, Iz.
no.
I told you to get it off your chest. You did.
did you forget yet?
Nope. Not yet.
give me a minute.
if there's still a spot for me in general surgery,
I'd like to take you up on that.
I spent months trying to talk you off peds.
I finally get on board, and you change your mind?
Tucker gave me an ultimatum...
the fellowship or our marriage.
you chose your marriage.
no, I'm leaving him,
because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums,
that's not a marriage.
I mean, what kind of husband does that?
so... I'm going to be a single mom.
it's not the time for...
new specialties.
damn.
I'm sorry.
it's just the first time I said it out loud,
so it just kinda took the wind out of me.
Miranda, are you sure about this?
I mean, he might come around.
he... he's just scared.
well, we're all scared.
I mean, if you're not scared, you're not paying attention.
o-one of my residents just signed up to go to war.
that's scary.
another one just almost lost her life to melanoma.
now she doesn't know what day it is.
that's scary.
what Tucker's facing isn't scary.
he's just weak.
no, a pat on the back isn't gonna help, sir.
okay. Um, should I go? Uh...
okay.
okay.
I'll just stand here with you
if that's all right.
Yes, sir.
that would be fine.
I thought you were operating on john doe.
I already did. Right now I'm looking at houses.
one has a stone fireplace, which I like.
this one has a backyard the size of montana.
you're buying a house?
Yeah.
right. Okay.
I'm buying a house right now.
it's a buyer's Market, and I'm buying a house.
the only reason that you're even talking about a house,
is to make me feel bad.
you're trying to prove that you're moving on without me.
so then I'll regret my decision and change my mind.
okay, is this what women are doing?
when they say they're moving on.
Yeah.
they don't usually take out a home loan to do it, but...
pathetic. Let me be clear. I'm moving on.
I'm a better woman than you.
ready to go?
I just got a page. Our john doe needs to go back into surgery.
Yeah. His post-op C. T. Showed a re-bleed.
I'm gonna have Nelson take care of it.
no, really?
Yeah. Well, I'd prefer to do it myself,
but I want to check in on Izzie.
maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after?
no, we can't.
because we have the George intervention after that.
I'll have Nelson do it.
you know what? Tell them to prep him.
we'll run to city hall, we'll come back. And we'll do it then.
Meredith...
no, you know, let's go. We gotta go.
we gotta run to city hall, we'll come back.
you'll check on Izzie, we'll monitor john doe.
I'll go talk George out of joining the army... look.
we could do this another day.
there is no other day. Every day is like this.
every day there's a crisis. There's no time.
Meredith...
I love you, and I do want to marry you today,
but there is no time.
you have a piece of paper?
for what?
I want to be with you forever,
and you want to be with me forever.
and in order to do that, we need to make vows,
a commitment, a contract.
give me a piece of paper.
I don't.
I-I-I don't.
I-I have post-its.
okay.
what do we want to promise each other?
that you'll love me...
even when you hate me.
to love each other even when we hate each other.
no running... ever.
nobody walks out no matter what happens.
no running. What else?
that we'll take care of each other.
even when we're old and smelly and senile,
and if I get alzheimer's and forget you...
I will remind you who I am every day.
to take care when old, senile... and smelly.
this...
is forever.
sign.
this is our wedding, a post-it?
Mm-hmm. If you sign it.
now what?
now I kiss the bride.
married.
married.
see that?
plenty of time.
gotta do an E.K.G.
what, I don't even get any small talk?
what's your problem?
well, I'll tell you.
I know that I'm supposed to be grateful.
for my new lease on life,
but Alex marched in here and basically told me.
that being married to me.
was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
Yeah, and that he was trying to decide.
if smothering me with a pillow was the best way.
to put us both out of our misery.
okay, where is it?
where is what?
Where's the note that says that?
did you write that down? No.
no.
Yes.
Yes.
I've gotta go. I've gotta find Alex.
go, go.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just... I was looking for George.
Bailey, it's after 6: 00.
Yes, uh, we scheduled an intervention.
so that we could give O'malley a piece of our minds.
about this idiotic army business.
now did he leave already? He never scrubbed in.
he told me he was enlisting. I sent him home,
told him to spend the day with his mom.
since he was leaving so soon.
uh, he took off this morning.
how's his I.C.P?
uh. Worse. O.R. Is expecting us.
I thought you were getting married. We did.
Oh, congratulations.
you sure you want to start your honeymoon in an O.R? We're sure.
you can't be in here.
I'll come and get you in the waiting room.
hold his hand until you put him under.
it really does make him feel better.
okay.
well, you made a good friend there.
I guess that happens when you take a bus for somebody.
okay.
I know this is scary,
but you do have a great team up there.
you want to try to write again?
can you hold the pen?
double 0...
Oh, god! Oh, god.
you paged me. What do you need? Well, way to go, dipwad.
telling your wife you're trying to figure out how to off her?
Oh, mind your own bus...
wait. How did you know that?
she told me.
you remember?
pillow or morphine. I got the whole thing.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.
of course you didn't.
you love me too much to shoot me up with morphine.
even if I asked you to.
and my stupid corked brain is coming back. Oh, my god. I was so scared.
I mean, I would've loved you no matter what, but...
you're back. You're back.
Iz?
Iz?
Izzie? Yang!
it's George! It's George!
it's George! John doe is George!
Izzie, look at me. Open your eyes!
page Shepherd. Page the chief and Bailey right now.
we have you, O'malley. You hear me? We have you.
we'll fix this. Just stay with us. O'malley, it's Shepherd.
you're not going anywhere. You understand me?
B. P.'s dropping. All right, let's put him out, now.
what happened? Is it her brain?
no, it's hyperkalemia. We couldn't control the arrhythmias.
her pressure's dropping off a cliff. Give me an intubation tray.
Alex...
she signed a D.N.R. Shut up, Yang.
she knew this might happen. That's why she signed it.
I don't give a crap what she signed.
Alex, it's not what she wants.
(continuous tone) get a crash cart!
Karev, if she doesn't...
look at her! Get a crash cart!
screw the D.N.R. Hand me those paddles.
yang, take over compressions. Karev, back up. I got it. I got it.
one, two, three. And down.
okay, down.
did you say it?
I love you...
clear.
I don't ever want to live without you...
you changed my life...
did you say it?
make a plan...
set a goal...
work toward it...
but every now and again, look around...
drink it in.
cause this is it.
we're losing him!
it might all be gone tomorrow.
when something begins,
you generally have no idea how it's going to end.
the house you were going to sell becomes your home.
the roommates you were forced to take in become your family.
and the one-night stand you were determined to forget,
becomes the love of your life.
Hey. How long have you been up? - All night.
I was trying to figure out how to get the tumor out of Izzie's brain.
why are you smiling? - 'cause I figured out how to do it.
once Izzie's in the clear, we're gonna go to the Bahamas.
and have our wedding on the beach.
the one and only beach club...
you can actually have drinks during the ceremony.
are you sure you're okay to be up and around?
Yes. I have good days and bad days.
Plus, I don't want to spend our entire honeymoon in a hospital bed.
this is not our honeymoon.
it totally is.
come on. I want you to meet my friends.
I know all your friends.
you know all my doctor friends. I'm a patient now.
you're gonna meet my patient friends,
and they're gonna love my new husband.
don't make a big deal. - I'm not gonna make a big deal.
I'm a bride.
iz, come on. I'm getting her a real one.
I love this one,
and that makes it a real one.
okay, everybody, this is Alex, my husband.
husband, this is Austin Star.
meg Miguel and Alison.
can you turn him around so we can see the butt?
Yes. Alex?
what, are you kidding me?
no. Oh, a big trauma just came in. That's...
that's quality booty. - Right?
congratulations, Izzie. - Thank you.
so, uh...
I had a good session with my shrink this morning.
did you talk to her about your mom?
I mean, have you seen your mom yet?
cause she lives, like, you know, a few miles away,
and she thinks you're still in Iraq.
Yeah, I...I'm planning to see her.
when?
Dr. Hunt... I'm not on trauma today?
follow me, O'malley.
lieutenant Lowell, I'm Dr. Hunt.
we spoke on the phone.
major Hunt, it's good to finally meet you.
my C.O. Has told me a lot about you.
Ah, you shouldn't believe anything Steve Mason tells you.
this is Dr. O'malley, and you've already met Dr. Torres.
I'm looking at Charlie's post-op scans, but I'm not finding anything functionally wrong with the leg.
except that I can't walk or run or move really.
without serious pain.
I've tried everything... medications, physical therapy.
nothing works.
which could indicate nerve damage.
or a chronic pain syndrome.
and we can definitely look into pain management procedures,
but surgically, I'm afraid, uh, there's nothing I can do.
actually there is.
you could cut it off.
you can cut it off and replace it with a prosthetic leg.
so I can get back to Iraq where I'm needed.
did you know that's why he was here?
no, but is it such an unreasonable request?
unreasonable? Cutting off a viable limb is dismemberment.
that kid made lieutenant at 19.
he was planning on spending the rest of his life In the military.
they gonna take him back with one leg?
there have been several lower-leg amputees.
who've returned to active duty with prosthetics.
voluntary amputees?
maybe. I don't know.
are you saying I have to turn this kid away?
his C.O. sent him here because he trusts me.
we could get another set of scans - and then try an epidural for the pain. - Dr. Torres?
fine. Do an M.R.I. And an epidural.
I'll take a look at the scans,
but if the leg is healthy, I'm not cutting it off.
Dr. Bailey, are you busy today? - That depends.
you got any more dying children, you want me to become overly attached to before they expire?
no. I have an 8-year-old neuroblastoma patient,
and he's gonna live. I can feel it in my bones.
so scrub in with me and see the joy. Um,
um, Dr. Bailey.
may I borrow you?
who is Santa Claus?
an old white man who lives at the north pole
and enters people's homes inappropriately.
no.
I'm Santa Claus.
all systems ready.
Oh, no, you did not!
Oh, yes, I did.
the Da Vinci Si HD Surgical System.
tell me you didn't wait till I had all but left the general surgery program to buy us a Da Vinci!
care to take it out for a spin?
Santa.
Hey, I was thinking, you know,
with, uh, Derek and Meredith getting married, they, uh,
probably don't want us hanging out in the attic much longer.
so I was thinking I'd start looking for a condo.
perfect, then you'd finally have a place of your own.
actually, I was, you know, thinking maybe you'd, uh, - You'd come with me. - Absolutely.
no, I-I... I would love to see it.
I'm so happy for you.
how much of that did you hear?
you mean the part where you asked her to move in with you,
or the part where she shot you down?
I was here for both.
by the way,
it's just way too early for you to be moving in with Lexie.
you don't have to do everything I do.
this is not about you.
I have my own future to think about. Life is short.
look at what's going on with Stevens.
don't worry about Stevens.
I got a plan.
you want to remove her hippocampus?
one of them. It's a common procedure for seizure patients.
removing her hippocampus could compromise her memory, her speech.
she wouldn't be able to practice medicine anymore.
I have performed this surgery hundreds of times.
on cancer patients? - No, but it's...
if you do the surgery, I could lose my memory?
it's unlikely, but it's possible.
and if you don't do the surgery?
we could shrink the tumor with I.L.-2.
if the tumor doesn't kill me first.
why take the chance?
have you even done a Wada test to see how her memory would be affected?
putting her brain to sleep and asking her to remember a bunch of flash cards is not an accurate assessment of the post-surgical outcome.
but it would tell us whether or not she could function afterwards, - and as Dr. Stevens' primary physician... - Fine, I'll do it.
it's unnecessary...
the surgery is unnecessary. The tumor's already symptomatic.
she's having hallucinations.
that's a nice ring.
Alex outdid himself.
we're gonna have beautiful kids, Don't you think?
is four too many?
four is perfect.
ideally, it would be two boys and two girls...
one of which would definitely be a tomboy.
and I was thinking I should have them pretty close together,
though that might be stupid.
why wait?
exactly.
that way, If I'm not able to practice medicine anymore...
you won't want to.
you don't think?
do you?
I'm asking you.
why do you keep agreeing with everything I say?
because I am you. I'm your tumor.
you're... talking to yourself.
right.
at least until you have surgery,
if you have surgery.
are you gonna have surgery?
if Derek cuts the tumor out, I could lose my memory,
and if he doesn't, I could die.
I don't know what to do.
Alex, tell me what to do.
iz, I can't tell you what to do. - Of course you can.
you're my husband. That's what husbands do.
they stomp around telling their wives what to do.
it's your job.
no, my job is to support whatever you want to do.
I don't know what I want to do.
that's why I'm asking you.
okay, I have an idea.
let's put it to a vote. All in favor of the surgery...
no, we're not voting. No one's...no one's voting.
opposed?
I'm opposed...
to voting.
just decide for me. Please.
you don't have to know right now. Think about it.
I don't have time.
captain Mason told me that you saved his life.
at least four times in the field.
Yeah, and a couple of times in the canteen,
but don't tell Mason I told you that.
so... you think I'll get to go back?
are you sure you want to?
I mean, why do you want to cut off your leg.
just to go back to the war?
don't you have family?
you know what it's like to have family who don't know you,
who don't get you, maybe even don't like you?
Yeah, actually, uh, I have brothers.
me too. So there's that family,
the guys I grew up with,
and we've got nothing in common,
and then there's my guys in Iraq...
my real family
whatever we got into, we were in it together.
but here, I'm alone. I'm nobody.
and I've tried.
you know, I've tried fitting in here.
I've tried being a regular person.
I've tried getting a job, but there aren't any.
there are a lot of things that I wanted to be in my life,
a lot of things I wanted to do,
but none of them's here.
this is Alison Clark. She was referred to me two years ago.
Mets in her brain, liver, kidney?
she ended up having five surgeries,
and extensive chemo, which worked,
but then...
Oh, yeah, the mets came back.
that's when I started her I. L.-2 therapy.
and now...
after three treatments in as many months...
the mets are gone?
the mets are gone.
Dr. Stevens should be patient.
she should give her therapies a chance.
as surgeons, we like to cut,
but...
sometimes there's a better way.
let me retract that small bowel,
so you'll have better visualization.
you know what, chief?
thanks to Leo, you don't have to. Leo?
Leonardo Da Vinci.
here, here, watch this.
see?
540 degrees of wristed movement.
can't do that with a laparoscope.
or in open surgery.
feels pretty good, doesn't it?
Dr. Bailey,
are you making lightsaber noises?
uh, not anymore, sir.
you know, Dr. Chalikonda at Cleveland Clinic
is doing single-incision gall bladder removal through the belly button.
we could try that on the next one...
if you're up to it.
don't tease me, sir.
Oh, I'm not.
why should Dr. Chalikonda have all the fun?
it's impressive, but it took two years to get these results.
Yeah, but these two scans were taken three months apart.
but Izzie may not have three months.
that tumor could start bleeding in three days or three seconds.
and since when are you not about cutting?
since it may not be in the best interest of our patient.
and Derek's not acting in Izzie's best interest?
they're ready for us in radiology.
okay, Iz,
I am going to show you a series...
a series of images that you want me to try to remember,
once Derek puts the right side of my brain to sleep.
hit me. Show me what you got. Okay.
is that a schnauzer or a scottie?
how specific do I need to be? Dog's fine.
it's either a 727 or a 747.
plane.
Ooh, a 2-story victorian mansion.
we would also accept the word "house."
Schnauzer, 747, mansion.
or dog, plane, house.
I'm gonna put the right hemisphere of your brain to sleep now, okay?
dog, plane, house. Dog, plane, house.
dog, plane, house.
dog, plane, house. Dog, plane, house.
dog, plane, house.
dog, plane, house.
okay, now we just wait for the brain activity in that area to stop.
dog, plane, house. Dog, plane...
H...
okay, Iz. Can you tell me what you saw?
show her the cards.
um... what's this?
dog.
can you say dog?
what's my name? Just stick to the cards, Meredith.
Meredith.
you know my name. You can say my name.
this is what I was afraid of.
okay, who's Alex?
iz, okay, you don't have to speak.
just nod your head for me if you know who Alex Karev is.
the test impaired your memory to such a degree that
I have to strongly recommend you don't have the surgery.
Izzie, the test was the worst-case scenario.
the result has nothing to do with the surgery.
we don't know that.
what I do know is that not operating
is every bit as risky as the surgery itself,
if not more, but it's up to you.
what do you think?
I think he's talking to you, not me.
I'll leave you two alone to discuss this.
I'll come with you. I have a couple of questions.
wait, Alex.
just think about what you want to do for a second, okay?
I'll be right back.
you are not having this surgery.
I need you to not talk medicine to me, okay?
talk to me like I'm your friend,
like I'm the guy whose cereal you eat in the morning. - And tell me what to do. - Karev...
please. Karev, I can't tell you what to do.
what if it was Meredith?
what would you do if you had to choose
between spending a few more months with Meredith
knowing she was gonna die...
watching her hurt, watching her sick...
or spending the rest of your life
with someone who looked like Meredith but wasn't her anymore?
she's the one good thing that ever happened to me,
the one good thing.
so I need to know what to do.
I need you to tell me... what if it was Meredith?
I would ask her to have the surgery.
you couldn't remember anything.
you didn't know my name.
you didn't know who Derek was. You didn't know who Alex was.
you couldn't even remember how to speak.
how come I don't remember any of this?
because the tumor is sitting right in the middle
of everything that makes you you.
I was standing there talking to you,
exactly like I am now,
only you weren't there.
you weren't you. You were gone.
so what do I do?
well, Swender has a patient...
female, 22 years old, metastatic melanoma.
Alison Clark?
after three months of the I. L.-2,
her mets were gone... all of them.
you're not having this surgery.
don't do it. That's my vote.
don't have the surgery.
I didn't. I freaking hate surgery.
I'm hallucinating, Alison.
I have really long conversations with dead people,
and I see things that aren't...
like right now, for example,
I'm pretty certain there aren't birds flying over your head
because this is a hospital and that would be weird,
but that's what I'm seeing.
I have a brain tumor. Am I really not gonna let them cut it out?
I didn't let them cut out mine.
it's like...
okay, one minute, I'm this college kid,
rowing crew and being an idiot and forgetting my sunscreen and thinking it doesn't matter,
because I'm me,
and life has worked out pretty well for me.
and then the next minute,
they're cutting into my body every other week.
I had 15 surgeries.
and then I said, enough.
forget it.
I'll row crew in heaven or whatever.
and then the I. L.-2 worked.
it worked.
I come here every three weeks,
I get my medicine,
and... I don't have a brain tumor anymore.
Charlie, if we admit you,
if we do what you're asking us to do,
the pain in your leg...
there's no way of knowing if amputation will cure it.
but it might.
Yes, it might. And once I get the prosthetic, then...
uh, it will be months before I can even begin
fitting you with a prosthetic,
which won't feel anything like a new leg, by the way.
it will feel like 5 pounds of metal that hurts and pinches.
and what if the army says no? No, no...
what if they don't take you back? - They will. Chances are that...
you really want to take that chance, Charlie?
you're asking me to remove one of your limbs.
Yeah, you think I don't know that?
you think I want to cut my leg off? Of course not.
am I sure about this? No.
the only thing I'm sure about is that I am in hell right now.
that I am sure of.
I've lost everything...
everything I've worked for, everything that I care about...
and I've traded it in for a 6-times-a-day pain-pill habit that doesn't even work.
so don't waste both our times by trying to scare me,
because you do not scare me, Dr. Torres.
after everything I've been through, nothing scares me.
so are we gonna do this or not?
Dr. Robbins,
Dr. Bailey just performed Seattle Grace's
first single-incision gall bladder removal.
that's cool.
through the patient's belly button.
and now it's kinda creepy.
no, no. You shoulda seen it.
no scars, no bleeding, and about half the time it would've taken laparoscopically.
you want to do one after lunch?
I've got another coli.
y-you don't mind?
Oh, well, also,
I guess I'm on my own for this afternoon.
my neuroblastoma?
no, no, no, no. Don't worry. You don't have to.
you'll have the rest of your life to do neuroblastomas.
well, then I'll see you after lunch, sir. Okay.
chief.
Yes, Dr. Robbins.
chief...
did you want to tell me something?
I am going to cry, and I just want you to know
that I know that it's going to happen,
and I just want you to ignore it.
and I'm not crying because I'm upset.
it's just what happens when I get mad at people of authority.
you're mad at me?
I am mad at you.
and I'm crying because you're the boss, my boss,
which brings up my issues of authority and my dad,
who you kind of remind me of.
not that you're old, but you command respect.
people respect you. I mean, I know I do,
and I know Bailey does, which is why I'm mad.
because it's wrong, sir.
it's wrong and mean to use a robot
to lure Dr. Bailey back into general surgery 'cause I don't have a robot.
all I have are little kids,
and... they're not as fun as a robot.
and they're not shiny and...and new and silver.
and they don't have things coming out of their belly buttons,
but... I will fight you, and I will win... sir.
you think you can fight me and win?
Yes.
good luck.
because I have something that you don't have.
I have joy...
sir.
what's going on?
Oh, we're just going over, uh, Izzie's I. L.-2 schedule.
Oh, for after the surgery?
I decided not to have the surgery.
what?
uh, maybe we should come back...
Dr. Yang. Yeah.
you're having the surgery. What?
shepherd said this is your last shot. But I dec...
look, I am your husband,
and I say that you are having the surgery.
what happened to, "this is your decision"?
that was when I thought you were gonna make the right one.
but you chose wrong,
so now you don't get to make this decision on your own,
because you married me.
it's not just your life at stake anymore.
it's my life, too, my life with you.
so you can tell Swender whatever you want,
but I'm telling Shepherd and I'm telling you,
you're having the surgery.
she may be your friend,
but that doesn't give you the right to go in and...
and talk her out of a surgery you know nothing about.
you're not her doctor. You're Swender's resident.
what you did is not only inappropriate... It is unprofessional.
Derek... You crossed the line, Cristina.
and this. No, she didn't.
I did.
I'm the one who convinced Izzie not to have the surgery.
I'm the one you should be yelling at right now.
well, I'm gonna go now.
unless you want to apologize to...
okay.
my mother disappeared right in front of me.
everything she had, everything she was...
her dignity, her memory.
in the end, she wasn't even my mother anymore.
Izzie is not your mother.
she doesn't have an untreatable brain condition.
she has a tumor, and it can be treated.
don't make this personal, Meredith. I wasn't.
you went to Izzie as her friend,
and you made up her mind for her.
so now as my resident, you go back there and change it,
because this tumor will kill her.
quick consult, Dr. Yang.
what are you doing?
I've realized the reason I haven't told my mother I'm back
is because part of me is still over there.
I made a commitment to the army that I wasn't able to fulfill.
if my unit hadn't been destroyed,
I would still be there.
so no wonder I can't sleep at night
or...or look my mother in the eye.
no wonder you and I... we can't move forward.
my work there isn't done.
until it is, I have no business being here.
so... I've decided to go back.
I have to go.
Cristina, come on. What?
I'm sorry. What am I supposed to say?
I could use your support.
you don't have it.
Dr. Torres.
Dr. O'malley.
it's okay, Charlie.
you don't have to do that. No, I do, 'cause you were both just trying to do your job in there,
and your job is to put people back together,
not take them apart, and I get that.
and I know it doesn't make sense to you
that I would want to go back to a place
where people get hurt and die, but...
we're there because we're trying to help people,
save people, same as you.
it's my job, who I am, it's...
if something happened,
and suddenly you couldn't be a doctor anymore,
if someone told you you couldn't do it anymore,
wouldn't you want to do everything you could possibly do
to be a doctor again?
we haven't even been married 24 hours yet,
and we've already had our first fight.
that's a good sign.
fighting leads to good makeup sex.
are you watching birds fly around my head again?
am I, like, totally snow white right now?
I just don't want to hurt him.
he'll come around.
it might take a while, but once that tumor disappears,
once you're back at work, cutting open other people,
he'll come around.
is it hummingbirds at least?
I really like hummingbirds.
we need to go talk to Izzie.
no, we are not talking Izzie into having surgery
because your future husband is mad at you.
but he has a right to be mad,
because we didn't talk Izzie out of the surgery
as her doctors, we did it as her friends.
no, our job as doctors is to present the options, answer questions.
and let the patient decide their course of treatment.
that is what we did. Right.
except I may have presented her options as, "you're having the surgery over my dead body."
he has a right to be mad.
Oh, crap.
who is it?
Izzie? What the... what happened?
I don't know. Where's Swender?
Izzie, let me take over. Izzie, come sit down.
the vessels and nerves are separated.
skin flap is done.
remind me again why I'm doing this.
someone please remind me again.
you don't know what's gonna happen to this kid,
how many fights he could win, how many lives he could save.
if you don't do this,
he's never gonna get the chance.
we're not doing harm. We're not hurting him.
we are saving him.
we're doing what he wants.
it's what he wants.
B. P.'s still dropping.
we need more blood. We need to move faster.
okay, I'm done. I'm at the end.
I didn't see any bowel perforation.
it's there somewhere. Run it again. Dr. Swender...
run it again.
Yes, ma'am.
so much for I. L.-2.
you think this is my fault?
you think I did this to her?
no, ma'am.
there is no cure for cancer, Dr. Yang.
there's only us, the two of us, right here, right now,
fighting this thing as aggressively as we know how.
and sometimes that means
pumping toxins into the patient to kill the cancer,
and yes, sometimes, not very often, but sometimes,
those toxins kill the patient as well.
but Alison had three months to live
when she first came to see me,
and I have managed to keep her alive for two years.
so I am not about to give up on her
or the I. L.-2 anytime soon,
and neither are you.
I wasn't asking you to come see the condo.
I was asking you to move in with me...
if that's what you want.
I do.
you do?
Yeah. Not right away.
no, of course not. In, like, a year. Ten years.
I'm sorry, what now? Oh, um, well, because I'll...
I'll still be a resident for, like, six more years,
and...and then I'd want to get my practice up and running.
so... how about seven?
how about five years? I'll still be a resident.
so? Stevens and Karev are residents.
Meredith's a resident, Bailey's a resident...
all married or soon to be,
and happily... or whatever.
I'm sorry. Are you asking me...
to...to... to marry you?
no.
Why? Would you?
um, should we be having this conversation? No, probably not.
no, I... That's... okay.
impressive work today, Dr. Bailey.
thank you, sir. It was fun.
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
sounds like you guys had a good day.
Oh! How did the, uh, neuroblastoma kid do?
Oh, he was awesome. The surgery was totally easy,
and he's gonna make a full recovery.
that's kind of why I wanted you there.
cause the kids you can save
almost make up for the ones you can't.
anyways, I'm gonna go monitor him post - op.
and then I'm gonna tell his family the good news.
you should stop by, come see the joy. Okay.
we had to resect part of her bowel.
unfortunately, we weren't able to finish the surgery.
because she was too unstable.
right now she's on a ventilator,
because she can't breathe on her own.
but, uh, you're gonna be able to finish the surgery, right?
Yes, if she stabilizes.
and then she'll be able to breathe on her own again?
your daughter's heart stopped during surgery,
which means her brain wasn't getting oxygen.
so it's unlikely
she'll be able to come off the ventilator.
Oh, god. Oh, no.
Izzie.
Izzie.
Izzie.
you paged me. Are you okay?
no. I don't know what to do.
I don't know if I should have the surgery.
I think I'm gonna die either way.
you gotta tell me what to do. You know what to do.
no, I don't.
I don't.
Yes, you do.
you're just scared to do it.
this back and forth is just fear.
but you've already made the decision.
you already made it.
you made it the second you decided to fight this thing.
just look... where you started.
look where you are now.
I mean, now you're this...
incredible surgeon...
and teacher.
you're a doer, remember?
you know exactly what you have to do.
come in.
you can do it.
you can cut into my brain again.
okay.
you can do it, but...
I don't want to end up a vegetable.
Lzzie, you won't. - No, just listen.
I want the surgery, right now,
but if something goes wrong,
I don't want to end up on a ventilator.
so I'm signing a D. N.R.
please. - Alex...
look, you went crazy.
when Danny signed that D. N.R. you went crazy.
is that what you want? You want me cutting l-vads?
no, I... - You want to wreck my career?
cause I will. I will freaking cut l-vads before I let you...
just stop...just wait, stop.
you don't get to quit. you don't get to quit on me.
please... tear it up.
the D. N.R...tear it up.
where your eyes are supposed to be right now,
I see white sandy beaches...
and there's an ocean behind your head,
and there are ghosts wandering in and out.
I can't live like this.
and I can't live...
if something goes wrong in that surgery,
I don't want any extraordinary measures taken
to keep me alive.
it's not what I want.
I went crazy when Denny signed the D. N.R.
because I didn't understand.
I didn't understand, but now I do.
and I need you to understand.
I don't want you to go crazy.
I want you to have a brilliant career,
and I hope that I get to be here for that,
but if I can't, I just want to go to the other side.
I don't know what's there, but it's gotta be better than hospital beds and tubes down my throat,
so please...
please don't cut l-vads.
if it comes down to it,
just let me go.
and right now, kiss me.
please, please just kiss me, and close your eyes,
because the beach is so distracting.
I always thought it would be me.
I'd get Alzheimer's like my mother
and forget everyone.
let's go to city hall tomorrow.
I don't want to spend another day not being married to you.
okay.
it doesn't matter how good you are or how hard you work.
you can do all the research,
you can master all the latest techniques,
um, you can be the best,
you can be the best surgeon in the world...
but your patients are still gonna die.
cause the next day or the next... month
or next year, you know, they're just gonna...
get hit by a car or find a mole on their back
and there's nothing you can do about it.
I don't want you to die.
you okay?
I cut off a healthy leg.
I just cut it off.
it was for the patient's own good,
but still, I feel like a butcher.
my miracle case is on life support.
I thought I had one...One miracle.
I hate this job sometimes.
I don't know why we do this.
come on. Come with me.
okay, what are we doing here?
we came to see that.
what?
the joy.
it comes around rarely,
so rarely we forget it can happen.
that's why we do this...
the joy.
we spend our whole lives worrying about the future...
planning for the future,
trying to predict the future...
will you come with me?
as if figuring it out will somehow cushion the blow.
but the future is always changing.
got one more.
he's a doctor. He says he needs to do it today.
come in.
the future is the home of our deepest fears...
Owen?
Hi, mom.
I'm home.
and our wildest hopes.
but one thing is certain...
when it finally reveals itself...
congratulations, doctor.
welcome to the army.
the future...
thank you.
is never the way we imagined it.
doctors spend a lot of time
focused on the future...
planning it...
working toward it.
but at some point, you start to realize,
your life is happening now...
any changes overnight?
no.
not after med school, not after residency,
right now.
this is it. It's here.
blink and you'll miss it.
Oh, it's the chief. Somebody better make a coffee run.
you all look like hell.
I gotta be in surgery in ten minutes.
um, Mer, will you let me know?
Yeah.
we should go, too. It's probably gonna be a while.
shepherd said she'd wake up in the morning.
what did he tell you? Was that all crap?
what did he say?
he said it may be a while.
she's gonna wake up.
Stevens still isn't awake.
and I'm having something of a day even aside from that.
so... don't take my face personally.
it's just my face today. - Did you tell her?
uh, you should tell her,
and don't take her face personally.
on behalf of the department of pediatric surgery,
I'd like to welcome you to the fellowship program.
you're in! We're gonna get you a pair of wheelie sneaks.
Congratulations.
all right.
I know I didn't support you during this process.
in any event, I am behind you now.
I'm trying to be a big person here.
how about you meet me halfway?
wake up. Wake up.
wake up. Wake up.
wake up. Wake up.
I have a headache.
you're up?
you're up and you're talking.
you talked, right?
talk!
Ow. I said I have a headache. Stop yelling.
page Shepherd!
Ow. I'm sorry.
Hey, what's with hugging O'malley?
I slept, Cristina.
last night, I slept for the first time in...
I slept.
and, uh, I don't know,
hugging O'malley because you slept?
no, I hugged O'malley 'cause he's got great news,
which I'll let him tell you, but, yeah, I... I guess,
Yeah, maybe I hugged him because I slept.
and that's because of you,
because you came with me to see my mom,
and then I slept, and I slept without nightmares.
that's not a small thing, Cristina.
that... that is everything.
I can be a better man.
I can be a better man for you, and if...
I hope, you know, if you'll let me,
I can be a better man with you.
no, don't say anything.
just... just think about it, okay? Okay?
Dr. Bailey, I need to tell you something.
Oh, not now, O'malley.
I know. It'll be quick 'cause I gotta
get to the O. R. to scrub in with the chief.
now I think you're gonna be mad at first,
but I'm about to do something important,
and I'm very sure about this decision,
and I-I think eventually, you're gonna be proud.
but, you know, before that,
you're probably gonna be like...
what did you do?!
I'm... I don't mean to imitate you...
you call that quick?
I joined the army to be a trauma surgeon.
I report for duty tomorrow.
you did what?!
Yeah, that's where I thought we'd start.
you know, something's going on with George.
what?
Owen hugged him. They were happy.
well, we don't hug when we're happy.
are you better?
what?
you know, with your therapy. Uh, whatever.
you said you got well. Well, are you... better?
or are you just, you know, fake better?
what do you mean?
I'm asking you if people, you know...
I mean, are you actually different?
I mean, do you feel different?
I'm getting married today. Mm-hmm. City hall.
no muss, no fuss. Just quick and dirty.
well, uh... do you want me to come?
no, no. Just letting you know.
Oh, no, wait. Uh, uh...
okay, this is my grocery list.
it's old. Uh, this...this is new.
um, this is my favorite pen, so I want it back. Borrowed.
and all of it's blue, so you're covered.
now see, if we were George and owen,
we would hug right now.
dude.
unidentified male, dragged by a bus.
he's clamped down, so we couldn't intubate.
didn't they stop when they hit him?
bus driver didn't know he was there
until he got halfway down the block.
Oh, is he gonna be okay?
okay, I'll take over C. P.R.
push 20 etomidate and 100 of sux.
he saved my life.
the bus was gonna hit me. He threw me out of the way.
Grey, get her out of here.
it was supposed to be me under the bus.
he's all alone.
they don't even know who he is. Please.
all right, stand over there and just don't move.
he's back. Okay, let's get a trauma series,
trauma labs and o-neg blood in here.
severe avulsion injury to the left forearm.
whoa. Okay, his skull is bashed in.
page Shepherd. And Sloan.
start antibiotics and start cleaning out those wounds.
now can you get her out of here?
did you get the whole thing?
did you get the whole tumor out?
just let me finish my exam.
can you tell me your name?
my name is isobel Stevens. It's 2009.
and I'm in the... neuro I. C.U. at Seattle Grace hospital.
did you get the damn thing out?
got the whole damn thing.
you got it? Yeah.
Oh, god. You got the whole thing.
and I can talk and I know my name - And I'm not a turnip. - Nope.
no offense. Oh, no.
you are a great surgeon, but I really thought
I was gonna be a turnip.
this is so unbelievably great.
your kidneys are a little sluggish,
so we're just gonna keep an eye on your electrolytes for a few hours.
your post-op crit was... was fine. - Okay, good. Good.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the brain tumor? Did you get it out?
Lzzie, you just asked him that.
we just talked about it.
no, no, it's okay. She's gonna be foggy for a while.
the tumor's out.
there was a little bleeding during the post...
you got it? - Yeah.
all of it?
that's amazing.
Derek Shepherd, you are a hero.
and I know that that's Derek Shepherd.
and you're Alex. And you should kiss me.
Alex...
I don't have a brain tumor.
I'm tumor-free.
Yes, you are.
what's wrong? Why do you look weird?
no, nothing. Nothing.
uh, your kidneys are a little slow.
we're just gonna watch them.
okay. So you'll just recheck my electrolytes in an hour?
okay.
how did the surgery go?
did you get the tumor?
we did.
the tumor's gone.
there was a little bit of bleeding,
and we took care of that.
you got it?
Oh, my god.
and I can talk, and you didn't kill me.
what's wrong with you people? We should be celebrating.
she's like the woman who couldn't remember her husband was dead.
we had to keep telling her every five minutes.
could be a perfectly normal post-operative haze.
or the bleeding during the procedure blitzed her short-term retention.
did you screw up her brain? - Karev...
I'll be back. Try and stay calm.
freaking her out is not gonna help.
wake up.
man versus bus. - The bus won.
check out the left arm.
he's crashing again!
what do we got? - We got roadkill.
you mind? He stepped out in front of a moving bus
so he could pull a woman out of the way. He's a hero.
can you fix the arm? - Fingers are already blue.
if it's gonna happen, it's gotta be in the next few hours.
pupil's blown. Stop C. P.R.
okay, give me a cranial drill, please.
Grey, want to practice your burr holes?
stabilize his neck, please, nurse.
okay, hand her the drill.
okay, go in slowly. When you feel it grab, stop, 'Cause otherwise you're gonna be hitting the brain.
okay, let's go. Quickly.
right there!
pull back, pull back! That's it.
nice work, Dr. Grey.
I'm gonna go get some bacitracin for that face.
all right. Let's get his head rotated. Easy.
welcome back, sir.
you had us worried there for a minute.
you think he's gonna make it?
I hope so.
he really has to make it.
Dr. Sloan.
there's gonna be too much tension.
start over and do a layered closure.
can I ask a question about that?
okay. You brought up moving in together
and marriage, and I put it off.
and now you're embarrassed
and you won't make eye contact with me because
you feel that I have all the power in the relationship,
but I don't want all the power in the relationship.
I...I'm happy to share it. Can we just skip this part?
get some 4-0 vicryl so you can redo your patient's sutures.
I'll totally pretend I didn't hear any of that.
women do this to me.
I don't do this. "Let's get a house together."
sucks being the girl, huh?
I'm not the girl.
what do girls do?
well, we start with the cold shoulder,
so you're right on track.
and we go to our girlfriends and we bitch,
and our girlfriends say, "you want to build a future, build it yourself."
you don't need a man to give you that.
so you want to buy a house?
just buy a house.
you're good at this.
I ought to help someone get a love life.
I suck at my own.
he jumped in front of a bus... for me.
what did you do to O'malley? - Excuse me?
uh, somebody else around here likely to convince someone
to join the army and be a trauma surgeon in Iraq?
What?! The army?!
what?
v-fib. Charge the paddles to 360.
just call who you have to call and undo this.
Dr. Bailey, little busy here.
clear. - George? George O'malley?
it wasn't my idea. - No change.
charge again. - Clear.
I did what I could to give him a decent education in trauma.
I didn't know he was gonna go and enlist.
he keeps coding. - Here's why...
open-book pelvic fracture.
there's too much bleeding.
we take him to an O. R. now, he'll die on the table.
he needs to go to angio if we're gonna stop - The pelvic arterial bleeding. - Sinus tach. We have a rhythm.
it's barely there, but it's there. - Let's stabilize the pelvis.
I know what goes on in this hospital.
I know you're messed up from that war,
and not in a small way. Get him out of it.
page me if you need me. I've got other patients.
how'd you piss off all the women?
um, let's get our guy to angio.
angio? He's barely got a pulse.
it's now or never if we want him to live.
let's move.
sir, I know it's tough,
but I'd personally be very grateful
if you'd try and stay alive for the next few minutes.
maybe we're bouncier in peds than in general surgery,
but I thought that there would be a "yay"
or some jumping around.
cause you look pretty dour for someone
who's about to start a highly prized fellowship.
you are about to start a highly prized fellowship, right?
Hey, I've got a plan to stop George. Are you in?
stop George from what?
he joined the army. Yes, I'm in.
Bailey, I'm talking to you.
why are you trying to stop him?
because he joined the army. - And?
and because he's my ex-husband,
and I know his mom and I love his mom,
and normally Izzie would talk sense into him,
but she's got cancer and kind of a bad mental deficit,
so it's on me to stop him.
but why would you want to stop him?
because he joined the army.
don't you think that's a problem?
I think that's awesome.
awesome?
you gonna chew?
my dragged-under-a-bus guy's in angio,
and they're gonna page me any minute.
how's Izzie? Is she reiterating anything?
no.
OK. At 6: 00 P. M. your idiotic collegue
george O'malley would finish his surgery with the chief.
and at 6 P. M. you will be standing beside this in the O. R. hallway
prepared to join an intervention.
what? Polite company might call it intervention
though I'm not sure interventions
involve whooping people on the behind with a belt.
what, he's got a drinking problem now? - He joined the army.
What?! 007? He can't go to army.
he's the guy that gets killed.
he's that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun.
grey is going to coax him back as a loving friend.
you are going to use logic and reason
to point out the idiocy of his ways.
Stevens will make sad cancer eyes.
and if all of that doesn't work, Karev, you're gonna pull out
your "I was raised out back with the trash cans" roots - And just beat the crap out of him. - 6: 00.
1899/12/31 0: 06: 00
hey there.
I know this must be scary, but if it's any consolation,
you're a hard-core hero.
you saved that woman's life.
I-is he trying to write something?
can you hold this?
Oh, okay.
you'll be stronger tomorrow.
call O. R. One. Tell 'em to get ready for him.
Amanda, you can't be out here.
would you want to be all alone at a time like this?
we had 30 seconds of interaction
before he saved my life,
and... and I wasn't even nice.
I was standing on a corner when this...
ordinary-looking guy stands next to me and smiles,
and... and I'm so busy
scoping for someone hotter that...
I don't even give him a second look.
and next thing I know, he throws me out of the way of a bus I'm about to walk in front ofã€‰
and almost gets himself killed.
he literally... he swept me off my feet.
that is my prince in that bed.
okay, you can stay until they take him to surgery.
uh, not a good time. You know what? You walk away from me again,
I swear I will grab you by the hair and pull hard.
I grew up with the name Arizona.
I learned how to play dirty on the playground.
I stuck my neck out for you. You were my pick.
and I appreciate that, but it's a big decision.
it's not, frankly. It's the brass ring.
it's the most exclusive, it's the most competitive,
and we're as good as it gets.
nobody lands this thing and says no.
my husband informed me yesterday
that if I accept the peds fellowship,
if I sign on for another two years of training
and the hours and the workload that come with it
when I could be a general surgery attending
and make it home for dinner,
he will divorce me.
it's a big decision.
you're gonna have a hard time saving that arm.
I can get him back to full function
if I can get there in time.
I'm thinking about buying a house. - Good for you.
Meredith and I are gonna go to city hall this afternoon.
we're getting married. - Really?
Mm-hmm.
that's great news. - I know.
if I could just save Stevens...
you're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to get married.
you've earned that right.
congratulations, you lucky bastard.
come here. Give me a hug.
why is everyone hugging today?
Oh, the blushing bride.
all right, here is the plan for our john doe.
shepherd, you'll evacuate the epidural.
grey and I will correct the internal injuries.
that'll make room for Torres to place the internal fixator.
Sloan, you should still have time to work on the arm
if the patient doesn't get too acidotic or hypothermic.
do you think he has a shot?
I've seen people come back from worse.
Hey, I thought you were in surgery.
I'm on my way. Have you talked to Bailey
about this peds and Tucker thing?
no, I talked to Bailey about the army thing and George.
are you upset with me?
no, I'm awesome.
you said it was awesome.
George...sweet, kind George who can't even kill a fly...
is joining the army to go to Iraq
in the middle of a war, and you said awesome.
it is awesome.
no, it is not awesome. God! Who are you?
how's the arm? - The nerves are still intact.
just have to reattach the vessels. - You ready for me?
I'm almost done with the major internal crush injuries.
pelvis will be all yours in a minute.
give me some more laps, please.
you think you could do it?
step in front of a bus for a perfect stranger?
we'd all like to think we would, but...
that's more or less major hunt's been doing
every day for the last couple of years. Oh, no, the guys did.
I just came in behind 'em
with a dustpan and a broom and swept up.
you sewed up soldiers under fire.
you didn't sweep up.
how do you think O'malley is gonna do over there?
you think...you think he can handle it? - No, I don't.
I think he's gonna surprise us all.
I think he's coming back in a body bag.
I think you all should just shut up.
just shut the hell up.
please. Shut up.
shepherd got your whole tumor out.
Oh, my god.
Alex, why didn't you tell me? Oh, my god.
but we're working on it.
you remember what time you woke up this morning?
um, not exactly.
7: 45. "O'malley joined the army"?
what? - Yeah, he's gonna be a trauma surgeon in iraq.
When'd you wake up?
7: 45. He's gonna get killed. - Yeah, we're dealing with it.
did you know about this George thing?
Yep. Canon fodder.
I'm just gonna take some more blood.
last time we checked, your potassium was 6. 3.
When'd you wake up? - Um, early. I can't quite remember. I...
O'malley joined the army? George?
we're dealing with it.
what's your potassium?
uh, I...
iz, what's your potassium? - You know what?
why don't we just give her the chart to read
and try and memorize, okay?
and I can talk to you about her hyperkalemia.
look, she just had brain surgery
and an incredibly aggressive course of I. L.-2.
she needs rest.
she needs to exercise whatever memory she's got left
before it all turns to mush.
well, she's not gonna heal
with you barking orders at her like a caveman.
butt out, Yang.
no, she's my patient. I don't care if you're her husband.
look, she... you want to see how fast I can get your visiting hours - Down to zero? - She signed a d. N.R. She signed a frigging d. N.R.
and made me promise she'd come outta this with a life.
not in a hospital bed, not with no brain,
I had to promise she'd have a life.
you want to know what happens
if she can't make any new memories?
forget about being a doctor.
she's gonna need round-the-clock babysitters.
we get an apartment together, and she can't ever
find her way to the damn toilet.
tracker on her ankle in case, god forbid, - She wanders out the front door! - Alex, you can handle this.
she will get better.
maybe. Maybe not. It's on me.
her future is on me.
is he gonna be okay?
we'll know more in the morning.
go ahead.
how's she doing? Any better?
no. -Damn.
well, I'm going to city hall
to go do the thing.
Seriously? It doesn't seem like the day for it.
look at Alex.
he's in there working so hard all day,
and she doesn't know.
and if she stays like this,
she may never know how much he loves her.
and that girl amanda...
she's in there loving a stranger.
she thinks that's her prince charming. Mm.
I mean, he's probably gonna die today, chances are.
so yeah, I'm gonna go get married.
because I think it's important to take the time
to tell the people you love how much you love them
while they can hear you.
I love you, Cristina Yang.
you have changed.
Mm. Maybe I have.
what?
I'm gonna hug you.
maybe I don't understand people,
I don't see things.
so maybe I just don't get
what's going on with you or why you're so mad,
but I do think it's awesome.
I think that George joining the army is awesome. Um, shut up.
um, no. You asked me who I was.
I am a person who thinks that what George is doing
is dangerous and terrifying and brave.
he's going to serve his country.
he's going to risk his life to save the men and women
who make it possible for you and i to sleep safely in our beds.
I'm a person who thinks that that is brave.
and I am a person who stood in an airplane hanger
and watched them unload my brother's body in a coffin...
and all we got was a flag.
my brother died over there
because there weren't enough doctors, Callie.
so for my money, George O'malley is a patriot.
he's a hero,
and I am grateful that he exists.
so yeah, the word I use is awesome.
that's who I am.
I'm sorry.
sorry, I-I didn't realize...
Oh, no, no, wait.
I... love...You.
well, I-I-I love you, too.
no, just...
I love you.
I said... I said "i love you.
me.
Cristina Yang.
you traumatized me.
and you know that I am s... I am so sorry about...
Oh, no, damn it. Not about the choking.
it's... It's like you come here and then you pull out my icicle
and you make me love you, and I can't...
I mean, I don't want to...
I-I can't breathe...
without you.
you can do this. Cristina, we can do this.
all you have to do is just meet me halfway.
all you have to do is say yes.
all you have to do is say yes.
what's your crit?
this is disgusting.
I can't believe we serve it to the patients.
you keep asking for lime jell-o
and don't like it.
so stop giving it to me.
you get mad if I don't.
okay, now what's your crit?
I don't know. I'm tired.
what's O'malley doing tomorrow?
joining the army.
Yeah. I need a break.
you don't think I need a break? Suck it up.
What...god.
back off.
I'm sorry if this is hard for you,
but you are not the one
with the short-term memory of a carrot.
Hey. Go ahead. Get it off your chest.
it's not like I'm gonna remember in five minutes.
okay, I'm not the one with a carrot for a brain but I'm married to it 'cause of some crock of a wedding We walked into, and only because The two of us thought you'd be dead within a week.
you made me promise you that you wouldn't live like this.
so now what the hell am I supposed to do,
smother you with a pillow,
shoot you up with a-an overdose of morphine?
not really psyched about that. Leave you?
not really psyched about that either.
so I guess I'm kinda screwed, right?
I mean, not as bad as you,
but not a frigging walk in the park, either.
I'm sorry, Iz.
no.
I told you to get it off your chest. You did.
did you forget yet?
Nope. Not yet.
give me a minute.
if there's still a spot for me in general surgery,
I'd like to take you up on that.
I spent months trying to talk you off peds.
I finally get on board, and you change your mind?
Tucker gave me an ultimatum...
the fellowship or our marriage.
you chose your marriage.
no, I'm leaving him,
because a marriage that resorts to ultimatums,
that's not a marriage.
I mean, what kind of husband does that?
so... I'm going to be a single mom.
it's not the time for...
new specialties.
damn.
I'm sorry.
it's just the first time I said it out loud,
so it just kinda took the wind out of me.
Miranda, are you sure about this?
I mean, he might come around.
he... he's just scared.
well, we're all scared.
I mean, if you're not scared, you're not paying attention.
o-one of my residents just signed up to go to war.
that's scary.
another one just almost lost her life to melanoma.
now she doesn't know what day it is.
that's scary.
what Tucker's facing isn't scary.
he's just weak.
no, a pat on the back isn't gonna help, sir.
okay. Um, should I go? Uh...
okay.
okay.
I'll just stand here with you
if that's all right.
Yes, sir.
that would be fine.
I thought you were operating on john doe.
I already did. Right now I'm looking at houses.
one has a stone fireplace, which I like.
this one has a backyard the size of montana.
you're buying a house?
Yeah.
right. Okay.
I'm buying a house right now.
it's a buyer's Market, and I'm buying a house.
the only reason that you're even talking about a house
is to make me feel bad.
you're trying to prove that you're moving on without me
so then I'll regret my decision and change my mind.
okay, is this what women are doing
when they say they're moving on?
Yeah.
they don't usually take out a home loan to do it, but...
pathetic. Let me be clear. I'm moving on.
I'm a better woman than you.
ready to go?
I just got a page. Our john doe needs to go back into surgery.
Yeah. His post-op C. T. Showed a re-bleed.
I'm gonna have nelson take care of it.
no, really?
Yeah. Well, I'd prefer to do it myself,
but I want to check in on Izzie.
maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after?
no, we can't
because we have the George intervention after that.
I'll have nelson do it.
you know what? Tell them to prep him.
we'll run to city hall, we'll come back. And we'll do it then.
Meredith...
no, you know, let's go. We gotta go.
we gotta run to city hall, we'll come back,
you'll check on Izzie, we'll monitor john doe,
I'll go talk George out of joining the army... look,
we could do this another day.
there is no other day. Every day is like this.
every day there's a crisis. There's no time.
Meredith...
I love you, and I do want to marry you today,
but there is no time.
you have a piece of paper?
for what?
I want to be with you forever,
and you want to be with me forever.
and in order to do that, we need to make vows,
a commitment, a contract.
give me a piece of paper.
I don't.
I-I-I don't.
I-I have post-its.
okay.
what do we want to promise each other?
that you'll love me...
even when you hate me.
to love each other even when we hate each other.
no running... ever.
nobody walks out no matter what happens.
no running. What else?
that we'll take care of each other
even when we're old and smelly and senile,
and if I get alzheimer's and forget you...
I will remind you who I am every day.
to take care when old, senile... and smelly.
this...
is forever.
sign.
this is our wedding, a post-it?
Mm-hmm. If you sign it.
now what?
now I kiss the bride.
married.
married.
see that?
plenty of time.
gotta do an E. K.G.
what, I don't even get any small talk?
what's your problem?
well, I'll tell you.
I know that I'm supposed to be grateful
for my new lease on life,
but Alex marched in here and basically told me
that being married to me
was the worst thing that ever happened to him.
Yeah, and that he was trying to decide
if smothering me with a pillow was the best way
to put us both out of our misery.
okay, where is it?
where is what?
Where's the note that says that?
did you write that down? No.
no.
Yes.
Yes.
I've gotta go. I've gotta find Alex.
go, go.
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just... I was looking for George.
Bailey, it's after 6: 00.
Yes, uh, we scheduled an intervention
so that we could give O'malley a piece of our minds
about this idiotic army business.
now did he leave already? He never scrubbed in.
he told me he was enlisting. I sent him home,
told him to spend the day with his mom
since he was leaving so soon.
uh, he took off this morning.
how's his I. C.P?
uh. Worse. O. R. Is expecting us.
I thought you were getting married. We did.
Oh, congratulations.
you sure you want to start your honeymoon in an o. R? We're sure.
you can't be in here.
I'll come and get you in the waiting room.
hold his hand until you put him under.
it really does make him feel better.
okay.
well, you made a good friend there.
I guess that happens when you take a bus for somebody.
okay.
I know this is scary,
but you do have a great team up there.
you want to try to write again?
can you hold the pen?
double 0...
Oh, god! Oh, god.
you paged me. What do you need? Well, way to go, dipwad.
telling your wife you're trying to figure out how to off her?
Oh, mind your own bus...
wait. How did you know that?
she told me.
you remember?
pillow or morphine. I got the whole thing.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.
of course you didn't.
you love me too much to shoot me up with morphine
even if I asked you to.
and my stupid corked brain is coming back. Oh, my god. I was so scared.
I mean, I would've loved you no matter what, but...
you're back. You're back.
Iz?
Iz?
Izzie? Yang!
it's George! It's George!
it's George! John doe is George!
Izzie, look at me. Open your eyes!
page Shepherd. Page the chief and Bailey right now.
we have you, O'malley. You hear me? We have you.
we'll fix this. Just stay with us. O'malley, it's Shepherd.
you're not going anywhere. You understand me?
B. P.'s dropping. All right, let's put him out, now.
what happened? Is it her brain?
no, it's hyperkalemia. We couldn't control the arrhythmias.
her pressure's dropping off a cliff. Give me an intubation tray.
Alex...
she signed a d. N.R. Shut up, Yang.
she knew this might happen. That's why she signed it.
I don't give a crap what she signed.
Alex, it's not what she wants.
continuous tone get a crash cart!
Karev, if she doesn't...
look at her! Get a crash cart!
screw the D. N.R. Hand me those paddles.
yang, take over compressions. Karev, back up. I got it. I got it.
one, two, three. And down.
okay, down.
did you say it?
I love you...
clear.
I don't ever want to live without you...
you changed my life...
did you say it?
make a plan...
set a goal...
work toward it...
but every now and again, look around...
drink it in.
because this is it.
we're losing him!
it might all be gone tomorrow.
we begin life with few obligations.
good morning, Seattle. Welcome to this fine morning full of sunshine.
we pledge allegiance to the flag.
we swear to return our library books.
but as we get older, we take vows, we make promises, we get burdened by commitments
to do no harm, to tell the truth and nothing but, to love and cherish till death do us part.
so we just keep running up a tab until we owe everything to everybody, - and suddenly think, - what the...
are you sure it was a bear and not a deer?
there are a lot of deer in those woods, and the bucks can get pretty big.
I think I know the difference between a bear and a deer.
rest, ice and elevate, okay?
you know how--you know how I got to the car?
I had to throw a raw steak and run for my life.
that was a 10-ounce filet. I've been marinating it for three days.
we have to move!
where?
we barely make 30 grand a year.
and who knows if we're even gonna have a job after the merger?
we could move back to Meredith's.
you did not just say that? - Why not?!
because we're married now.
this is how it's supposed to be.
you and me out in the world, making a life for ourselves.
besides, don't you just enjoy waking up to the fresh air and the sounds of birds chirping?
you know what I enjoy?
I enjoy plumbing. I enjoy plumbing so much!
it's not that I don't love it at Mer's. I do. It's just...
I just-- I can't move backwards, Alex.
not after everything that's... I just need to keep moving forward.
okay?
thank you.
I know it hasn't exactly been easy around here and I know you want answers.
but I'm afraid I don't have them, not just yet...
he brought us down here to make himself feel good.
well, at least he sprung for good Danish.
you know how many nurses got fired for that Danish?
the Mercy West staff will be arriving in three days, and when they do, there will be more cutbacks and more layoffs.
and I need each and every one of you to step up and be leaders.
and when I can answer your questions, I will.
if you would like to make an appointment to talk about your concerns
is my hyperbaric lab getting shut down? - What about my burn center?
you were right. Excellent Danish.
what about the strain on radiology?
what about the robotics department?
anything?
Nope. There was a papillary muscle rupture in the C.C.U.
but the guy died before they get him into the O.R.
crap. I need surgeries, and I need them now.
I mean, I barely had a hundred hours in the O.R. this month.
and you know they're gonna keep the residents with the most hours.
what do you got?
um, diabetic ulcer.
down to the bone?
I'm done. Finished. Expired meat.
you're freaking out a little bit.
well, you haven't been kicked off of two services in one month.
I couldn't get into an O.R. If I was bleeding half to death. You got anything good?
I'm scrubbing in on an optic glioma later on with Derek.
I've never seen one.
what are you doing?
just making sure everything is running smoothly here.
and... it is. Kudos.
Oh, no, no, no. No.
I am on Hunt's service. Anything that turnsurgical down here is mine.
you don't need the hours. You just spent the last six months in the O.R.
unconscious on a table does not count.
Hey, his neighbor said that he wasn't getting his mail.
Mer-Meredith, oh, I heard you got... you got married on a sticker. That's great.
you know, we should go so you can have family time.
no, no, no. I don't know what's wrong with him.
did you pick him up off the floor of a bar, Lexie? That might be a clue.
Meredith, no, I'm not... I haven't been drinking.
I swear.
now that could be surgical.
okay, make sure his fluids are running wide open.
let's get that blood hung.
got F.F.P. Here.
what-- what about factor VII? Did you check his I.N.R?
okay, hang 50 mics of octreotide. - Got it.
Dr. Bailey, shouldn't we check for renal failure?
move. I need to lavage him. - No, I need to put this up.
okay, hey, pause.
there's way too many people here.
Karev, get the orogastric tube in.
the rest of you, out. - No, wait a minute. I'm in emergency!
but I was here first. This is emergent.
he made amends. He's not drunk.
all right, Irving, I'm taking off the growth. Let me know if you feel any pain.
he gets so many of these.
we should have the nursing home examine him when they bathe him.
I bathe myself.
of course you do, Irving.
he could fall in the tub.
why don't you two go get me a cup of coffee?
you already had a cup, dad.
too much isn't good for your ticker.
well, he can have decaf, Tommy.
we'll go get you a nice cup of decaf.
thank you, sweetie.
you know, I'm not demented. I'm just old.
all right, uh, Mr. Waller. All done. - All done.
there might be a little redness, but it should heal up nicely.
got it?
I've had these skin things for 30 years.
I'm not worried.
what I'm really here for is an AMS 700.
the, uh, penile implant?
Yeah.
well, usually the first step in treating erectile dysfunction's drug therapy.
I can, uh, if you're having symptoms, write you a prescription.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I took those pills years ago.
they never even gave me a liftoff.
and then my wife died, and I gave up.
but... I'm seeing this new gal from the east wing.
uh, she's a younger woman, and... I don't want to disappoint.
I understand.
but it is a surgical procedure, so... there is a question of safety, given your age.
my age. It's always my age.
the golden years. Let me tell you about the golden years, doc.
there's just gotta be more to life than eating pudding and watching CSI.
now come on.
can you give an old man a working Johnson?
did I tell you how great your hair looks? It's all just short and, um, edgy.
wow, you are really tweaking out.
how long has it been since you've cut?
over a week.
Stevens, I have something for you if you're interested.
well, I'm interested.
uh, an M.V.C. Came in a while back. During his workup, I found an abdominal sarcoma.
since then, I've been following his recurrences, and, uh, he came back today with his third one.
wondered if you could scrub in if you feel ready.
I'm ready. - I'm ready.
he's in pre-op.
you know I need a surgery.
and you know I don't play favorites.
people have been afraid to work with Stevens.
it's like she's gonna break or something. It's not right.
she is a good surgeon and she has a way with patients and a light touch.
you want nice? I can be nice to a dying husk.
Yeah. N-not a light touch.
my dad's dead.
at first I thought he was drunk, then he started puking blood.
and puking blood and disorientation usually means...- End-stage liver failure.
which means he's probably dead by now or he needs a transplant, and I hope he's not a candidate, because that means he'd be in the hospital for months.
uh, Mer. - He needs a transplant, doesn't he?
Yeah.
you've got end-stage cirrhosis.
we can treat the symptoms, but the only thing that can save your life is a transplant.
how did it happen this fast?
he bathed it in gin.
Alex. - No, your friend's right.
except for the gin. I was a scotch man.
What's-- what's the next step here?
do I get on a list?
um, Thatcher, the transplant board has a rule here.
an alcoholic has to be sober at least a year before he qualifies for a donor liver.
I'm only 90 days.
I'll do it.
I'll do it today. I'll-- I'll go get tested right now.
Lexie-- No, they just take a piece.
my liver will regenerate.
I can't ask you to do something like that.
it's... it's major surgery.
you're not asking.
you're my dad.
you want a kidney? I'll throw in one of those, too.
one more time.
you be the chief. You're all cranky and, uh, in a bad mood.
and I'll be Callie asking for her job back.
you are Callie.
right. So it works.
you said that yesterday, and the day before that and the day before the day before that.
so are you gonna do this?
Hey, it is not easy to ask for your job back after you told your boss to go screw himself in front of his entire hospital.
it's humiliating. - So you're not gonna do it.
What--what is the point? He already fired me once.
he's not gonna hire me back now just because of the merger.
whatever. Maybe being a surgeon's overrated.
I'd be happy doing lots of things. I could open a daycare.
babies are cute.
that one just spit.
calliope Torres, I don't want you to have to move to Cleveland to be a surgeon.
okay, I'm gonna do it.
later?
but I-I will come back later.
my girlfriend's moving to Cleveland.
Yep. Yep.
look at you. Coming in on your day off.
trying to get in to the O.R?
Yeah. I'm gonna give my dad a piece of my liver. End-stage liver disease. He needs my liver.
I'm giving him some. Go ahead, Steve.
wait a minute.
what is your problem?
well, my problem is, you don't just jump in to something like this without thinking about it.
take a couple days. We'll--we'll talk.
what is there to talk about? - It's major, life-threatening surgery.
okay, my dad needs a transplant, Mark.
I get that, but what you need to understand-- No, I don't think you get it at all.
you know what I don't get?
we're together.
we live together.
we need to decide these things together.
you can't just go under the knife and leave me a note.
no, I-I would've paged you.
I'm your boyfriend, Grey. - He's my dad.
okay. A little pinch.
I cannot get this stupid thing to work.
try knocking it on something.
excuse me. - Insider trick.
what other tricks you know?
well, stay away from the lime jell-O.
and if you want the good meds, tell' em you have a headache, not a stomachache.
Oh, and if your arm starts to hurt from all the needle pokes, tell' em you want that anesthetic cream.
it numbs it. - You've done this before.
stage IV melanoma.
um, Mrs. Helsby, I'm gonna have to give him a rectal exam. So you may want to leave the room for this.
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm not his wife.
what's that saying-- uh, they won't buy the cow if you give 'em the milk for free?
Yeah, we're working on eight years of free milk.
Hey, I was gonna propose last year, but I got distracted by this little thing called cancer.
you got the best excuse in the book.
nice.
the ring's at home in the mouth guard container, all right?
I'm just waiting for the right moment.
what we'd do is we'd surgically place the silicone implant into the penis, - and when the pump is squeezed before intercourse-- Where does the pump go?
in the scrotum. - So to pump it up, I just squeeze the jewels?
dad. Dad.
It's--it's--it's ridiculous.
you're 82 years old. - So?
I shouldn't have a sex life?
go on, doc. You're just getting to the good part.
no, no, listen to me. This is major surgery.
they have to cut your... they cut you open, dad.
you could bleed or... you want to die, huh, over an erection?
wars have been fought over an erection, son.
Irving, I'm--I'm sure that a-a thing like this isn't covered by medicare.
and I know you don't want to use your savings, - oh brother 'cause you're gonna want to help Janey pay for college.
sweetheart, I love Janey.
but let's stop pretending she's going to college.
she's pretty, but she's not too sharp.
dad. - Tom, this is my money.
this is the way I want to spend it.
your mother and I saved our entire lives for what she called a rainy day.
and then she died before we could spend one cent.
I think your mother would be proud that I'm finally doing something nice for myself.
you think mom would be proud you're getting a penis pump?
okay. We're gonna have to run some tests.
we might not even know if the surgery is an option.
so why don't we all just calm down, start from there?
Hey, whatcha lookin' for?
excuse me?
Oh, I-I couldn't help but notice, uh,you have no resident on your decompressive laminectomy.
well, today's your lucky day, 'cause I'm available.
yang, right?
I-I heard you were hard-core into cardio.
I can be hard-core into anything you want.
are you whoring yourself out for surgeries?
Oh, shut up. You forced me into it.
Biology--it's crap, utter crap.
D.N.A. R.N.A.--Doesn't make someone your family.
it does, actually.
he needs a liver transplant.
Lexie volunteered like she just got asked for a $1 bill.
I left the room. He's not my father.
wait, your dad needs a transplant?
maybe not. Maybe he's dead this time.
Ah, damn it.
it's worse than I thought.
the scarring's completely fused his organs together.
God, it looks like somebody poured a bottle of glue down there. How do we fix it?
we don't.
if we could just to the cancer, I think we could get clean margins.
with this many adhesions, the risk of tumor rupture-- it's too high.
we cut into him again, we're doing more harm than good.
but maybe if we just-- have to know when to say when, Stevens.
and I'm saying when.
is he dead?
no.
we rushed Dr. Grey's labs. She wasn't a match.
okay. Um... what about Holly?
you, uh, you-- Molly, our sister?
Yeah. - She lives on an army base with her husband in bahrain.
um, plus, she has a history of DVT. So she can't be a donor.
Meredith, we didn't call you here to...
w-we thought you should know before we go in and tell him, just in case.
right. Right. No, thank you for keeping me in the loop.
thank you. I,um, have to go prep for my surgery now.
okay.
why are we eating lunch in a room full of diseased organs?
we are hiding from Lexie and her big, sad "I love my daddy" eyes, because I can't take it anymore.
wait, is little Grey not a match?
Oh, damn. There goes my transplant.
nice try. It was my transplant.
are you gonna get tested, Mer. - No. Barely know the guy.
you might as well just get tested.
you could regret it if you don't do it.
he might be a drunk deadbeat, but he gave you the ultimate gift.
Yeah, the gift of life.
you guys are sick.
you really are. You're sick. Don't listen to them, Mer.
they just want a surgery.
mama needs to cut.
babe, you got some dirt on your neck. Right there.
that's not dirt. It's a tick.
get it--get it off me.
Oh, is that a tick? - It is a tick.
it's a tick. - Look at it. It's all swollen.
get it off me now, please. - It's having lunch, too.
get it off me! Get it off of me right now!
get it! Get it! Somebody, take it off!
you know, the kids think this is all vanity.
but I really need this surgery, doc.
well, if she loves you, she'll understand if you can't... perform.
cuddling nice, too.
you know, you're just a kid, doc. You won't understand.
but one day, you're gonna wake up and all the big stuff, all the milestones you've been looking forward to
graduation, wedding, having kids, your grandkids-- it's all behind you.
it's all over.
all you got is a bunch of yesterdays and very few tomorrows.
I haven't wanted to make love with a woman since Sylvie died over 20 years ago.
and then one night... one night...
they sat me down at the bingo table with Marion.
and you just knew.
she's my tomorrow.
he's still sleeping.
good. He needs his rest.
Dr. Bailey, I,um, I-I was wondering if-- if you could lie, if--if you could lie to the transplant board and--and tell them that he's been sober for a year.
um, they trust you. They'll listen to you.
and--and maybe then he could-- he could get on the list.
Dr. Grey, I have 15 other patients all waiting for liver transplants
15 people in an untenable situation, none of whom drank themselves into it.
so, no, I will not lie, not for you, not for anyone.
do you have any other questions I can answer?
how would you like it-- things crawling all over you, stupid squirrels having a party alnight on your roof?
I mean, what the hell are they doing up there anyway?
applying betadine to the area.
I don't know how to deal with this.
I mean, I don't camp.
my parents were lounge lizards. I was raised in a bar.
extracting the arachnid.
and then there's no plumbing.
I mean, the--the toilet?
it empties into a bucket underneath the trailer.
a crap bucket!
and Izzie's all, marriage is an adventure, just the two of us, exploring the wild.
I married freakin' Lewis and Clark.
well, I guess I'm done.
that's it. I mean, I'm--I'm telling her, we're moving back to Meredith's.
I'm done.
you can't do that.
why not?
because that's not how it works.
I mean, she's just been through hell. She's not okay yet.
just give her one, Alex.
since when did you become a marriage counselor?
I guess when you save someone's life, you kinda want it not to suck.
you know, I hate when people who don't live here say that Seattle weather sucks.
those people suck.
I wanted to show you something. I made a list.
you made a list? - Yeah, to read to the chief.
50 reasons why you should hire me as an attending.
okay, number one, I built a man's bones out of tinium rods.
two, what I lack in experience, I make up for in raw talent.
three, I can go seven hours in the O.R. without even taking a pee break.
four... what are you doing?
I'm going back to the hospital.
uh, this is important.
I lost my favorite scrub nurse yesterday.
Anne-- she's a single mother.
she's supporting three kids, and now she's out of a job.
and this morning, a 10 month old hemorrhaged while I was deep in her chest, and I didn't have my favorite scrub nurse.
I had to actually look up and ask for a mesh wrap because the new nurse didn't know me Anne knew all my moves before I even made 'em.
and it felt terrible to be in the O.R. without her.
I was really looking forward to spending 30 minutes in the park with my girlfriend.
cause this merger thing?
it's important to all of us.
sorry. I've been... just... sorry.
he'll say yes or he'll say no.
and then we'll know.
okay.
this our optic glioma guy?
are you sure you're up for this?
there'll be others. I promise.
Yeah, you know, everyone is looking at me like I owe him something, but he's still the bad guy here.
you don't owe him anything.
I...
so I'm gonna be fired.
I've done a lot of really dumb things today, including pulling your medical files.
Lexie-- just listen.
I didn't want to do this.
I didn't want to have to come to you for anything, ever.
so I thought if I looked up your blood type and it was the wrong one, then that would be it, then I could just stop thinking about it.
but I can't, because you have his blood.
and I know that he's not your dad.
I know that he was never there for you.
and I'm--I would never ask you to give him anything.
he doesn't deserve a thing from you.
he doesn't.
but he's... he's gonna die, Meredith and so I'm asking you to give something to me.
I'm asking... I am asking you to save me my dad.
because as crappy as he was to you, oh, he was wonderful to me.
he never missed a single dance recital.
he was there at my fifth grade graduation, and what is that?
that's not even real.
I know he's not your dad.
I-I know that.
but somehow... you have his blood, and I don't.
so I'm asking you... give me my dad.
Hi, Meredith.
we found a match.
what?
we found a match, a donor liver.
so we're gonna schedule the surgery for tonight.
uh, that's terrific.
I... but I thought I-- I wasn't eligible for the... the transplant list.
it's not from the list. It's me.
I got tested, and my crossmatch was negative, which means we're an ideal match.
so I'm gonna go get admitted, and we'll do this.
mer. I'm a drunk, Meredith.
I did this. I put myself in this bed.
I broke me.
I can't.
I won't let you put me back together.
I've put you through enough.
it's a generous offer.
I can't. I can't accept it.
I'm sorry, but there's gotta be something else you can do.
he's 31. We just bought a condo together. We just rescued a puppy.
Ange, Ange, it's gonna be okay.
no, it's not.
there just sending you home to... what kind of doctors are you?
you're supposed to do something.
they're doing everything they can.
all right, look, Dr. Hunt's given us extra time, time that we never would've had.
Dr. Hunt, can I s-- Excuse me.
we could try cytoreductive surgery.
it won't work. We have to be able to remove the entire tumor.
with these kind of adhesions, you can't do that.
okay, then what about ball-tipped electrosurgery?
it could help us get around the adhesions. - His cancer is incurable.
now I'm not gonna put that man through another excruciatingly painful surgery - when he's got a survival rate of 13%. - I had 5%.
Stevens-- I had a 5% chance of survival.
I have incurable cancer, but I am living with it.
and the only reason I am, the only reason I'm standing here right now is because no one ever said to me, "we've done everythinge can do."
I'm alive right now because people fought for me.
Cristina fought for me.
he deserves the chance to fight. He doesn't want it, fine. I will shut up.
but he deserves a chance.
you know what? I'm good. I'm off the hook.
I did what I was supposed to do.
I offered. Mother Teresa would be proud.
you gotta go back in there.
and do what, cry and call him "daddy"?
he's the sick one, okay?
he's sick and you're not. You gotta go back in there.
just say what you gotta say and make him take it.
Alex, I tried.
try again.
his B.P. Is normal.
his blood work is pristine.
he, uh, appears to have the heart of a 50 year old.
so what does that mean?
uh, that means cleed for surgery.
and you're really gonna go through with this, dad?
you bet I am, Champ.
well, it's your money. We can't stop you.
but Irene and I have talked it over.
we've decided if you do this, we're taking you out of the home, moving you back in with us.
I don't want to move in with you.
I am happy where I am.
no, that place is causing you to make irrational decisions.
you're going after a younger woman, sneaking into her room at night.
it's not appropriate for a man your age.
now there's an extra twin in Janey's room, and she'll be thrilled to spend more time with her grandpa.
come on.
it's just an erection.
excuse me?
all the guy wants is a woody.
God forbid you get to be his age, and your kids won't let you have one.
he's your father.
he's taken care of you your entire lives, given you everything.
and now he needs something, and you want to throw that in his face?
you know how many people would jump at the chance to give back to their parents, who would sacrifice everything without blinking...
and there's nothing wrong with dating a younger woman.
it keeps you young. And that's my professional opinion.
does the chief always...
pay such attention to his patients, or just the ones... whose wives he had an affair with?
sorry.
how'd I do this to myself?
how did I end up here?
you woke up every morning...
and you promised yourself that last night would be your last drink.
and you made it... until 9: 00 A.M. or noon...
some days till cocktail hour.
and you were so pleased with yourself that you rewarded yourself with a drink.
you convinced yourself again that it would be the only one.
you have a disease, Thatcher.
when you're in it, you can't stop.
you can't undo what you did.
but Meredith... is offering you a second chance.
you need that liver.
you need it now... if you want to live.
I took her childhood.
I can't take any more from her.
you... you better take care of my girls.
you owe me at least that.
my stromal cancer patient?
we're going for the surgery.
we're gonna do it. Hunt actually listened to me.
that's great. - Right? I'm gonna go scrub in.
Oh, hey, are you okay?
I'm sorry about the whole tick thing.
I'm fine.
Ah, it's--it's a small price to pay for fresh air.
okay. - You're welcome.
you're the guy who used to pour my cereal in the morning.
that's it.
that's all I remember about you.
you're not my father.
you're just the guy who used to poury cereal.
and if you die, it probably won't change my life that much but it will change hers.
if you die, it will break her.
and I'm not gonna let you do that.
I don't know what it's like to have a father, but I do know what it's like to have a sister, and it's good.
and if we can get through this, then the door will be open for us to get to know each other.
the door's open.
so before intercourse, he squeezes the pump in his scrotum.
and... And his age doesn't make it high risk?
Oh, well, I mean, there's-- there's always risk involved, but this is the most technologically advanced solution to his problem.
what's high risk?
does someone have a risky, high-tech surgery?
uh, Cristina, I don't think you want to, uh-- I think this would be a real challenge for Dr. Yang.
do you think she can handle it?
Oh, I can handle it. - I don't think she can handle it.
I can handle it.
Pre-op's in 20-83.
thank you, Dr. Sloan.
I'm gonna pay for that later, but it was kinda worth it.
beat it. Sloan wants me on this.
okay, Mr. Waller.
I'm Dr. Yang. I'll be taking over your pre-operative care this evening for your penile implant surgery.
you're getting a penile implant?
Yes, ma'am.
that fella, he was just gonna shave me.
terrific. - But you wanted a surgery.
Yeah, putting a bicycle pump in some old man's junk... is not surgery.
it's--it's-- it's punishment.
well, at least you don't have to be laid up in bed for the next month.
you better tell me all the gossip about the Mercy West people.
I want all the gory details. - Yeah, yeah.
am I stupid for doing this?
no.
Really? - You get to save your dad's life tonight.
what are you doing here?
you didn't think I was gonna let you do this by yourself, did you?
this is not how this is going to work.
do I need to find you something to do?
no. I have a penis.
I'm gonna sit by her head. I won't say a word.
shepherd, this is my O.R. - I respect that, Dr. Bailey.
but this is my wife that you're cutting into.
I... I haven't just been waiting for the right moment to propose.
you've been waiting for remission.
Yeah. I just didn't want to saddle her down with a sick husband.
but now it looks like that just might be part of the package.
so... what the hell?
I'm not gonna waste another moment.
you shouldn't.
ready when you are. - You ready?
I had five interns.
four of you have been on this table.
one of you has cancer, one of you died.
you better not pull anything funny on me, Grey.
all right, let's see what we got here.
Dr. Yang, the, uh, senior resident, should test the apparatus.
I'll understand if you wanna pass.
I don't pass, Dr. Sloan. This might be a joke to all of you, but I do my job.
squeezing the scrotum.
nice. Awesome.
liver's here.
make sure you keep the bowel covered.
I need more wet laps.
Oh, he's got some collateral bleeding.
I'm gonna need the argon beame hang more F.F.P.B.P.'s dropping out.
sir, you really can't kill this guy.
I'm aware of that, Karev.
if it's bad news, I don't want to wake her.
wake her.
he had a couple months, and we just took that away.
I'm sorry. It's my fault. - No, it's my fault.
it was my call, and it was the wrong call.
I was wrong, and I should've known better.
I should've... I should've taught better.
but, you know, you see a one in a million, and you want to believe.
I was wrong to do the surgery.
I was wrong to put you on this case.
you weren't ready. You weren't ready to be here.
you beat the odds, Stevens. You were that one in a million.
but you cannot be a doctor and a patient in here.
you have to choose.
how'd it go, doc?
I don't think you'll be disappointed.
well, well, well.
Dr. Sloan, I'd... I'd like you to meet my Marion.
Hello, sweetheart.
sir.
now is not the time, Yang. - I have good hands.
they're fast. They're dexterous.
they were made to throw ties and do complex procedures.
these hands were made for surgery.
today, they should've been deep inside a heart saving a life.
instead they removed a tick and pumped a penis.
what's your point?
my point?
you know what? You should cut me.
what? - From the program.
you have to make more cuts, and I should go.
cause if you can't give me a brilliant cardiothoracic attending who is willing to teach me, then I can't get what I need from this hospital.
everyone is scared of losing their job, and so am I.
but if I can't learn, if I can't use my gift, then I... I-I guess that scares me more.
that's my point, sir.
the thing about being a surgeon... everybody wants a piece of you.
we take one little oath...
the case where he kept his mouth guard-- you should open it.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
and suddenly, we're drowning in obligations...
to our patients, to our colleagues, to medicine itself.
chief.
are--are you okay?
I have responsibilities... to make this hospital the best medical facility it could be...
to repair what I have broken, even if it was 20 years ago.
if I am now the bad guy, if I am now the villain here, well...
well, so be it.
this must be so hard for you.
Thanks, Torres.
I w--I was gonna... I was... but I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go.
so... you take care, okay?
Torres. - Sir?
go see H.R.Tomorrow.
tell 'em you're an attending surgeon at Seattle Grace Hospital, and you want a new badge.
and... take some of these Danish home.
they'll just go to waste.
so we do what any sane person would do.
we run like hell from our promises, hoping they'll be forgotten.
Oh, god.
a deer?
we have to move.
but sooner or later, they always catch up.
you're awake.
H-how--how's your pain? Is your--is your mouth dry? There's water. Are you thirsty?
have you been sleeping on me all night?
Yeah. I was... move between you and dad, who--who's doing good.
good. Good. That's good.
and sometimes you find the obligation you dread the most...
Lexie. - Yeah.
you're on my I.V.
Oh, sorry. OK.
isn't worth running from at all.
the body is an infinitely complex mass of interacting systems.
people like to think doctors see it all clearly.
but it's not always obvious what's a hiccup in the system, and what's a full on medical disaster.
we figure that out in our first year of residency.
Hey, you sleep okay?
great.
we spend the rest of our careers lying about it.
I probably can't write about this in the article, but something about how my toothpasteh it the sink made me realize that the array could be designed asymmetrically.
makes it more versatile. - Exactly.
so what you're saying is that you can't spit without having a genius idea.
well, it may not work.
zola, are your socks on?
it was a revolutionary glob of spit.
so if you need anything, just call me and...
no, I don't need anything. I just need to read everything that was ever written on the mediastinal teratomas and crank out a grant proposal.
all I need is quiet.
well, I can't promise you too much quiet because you did say that I could come visit.
I did say that. - Yeah.
Oh, that's the best part of my day.
Hey, welcome back.
Hey, thanks.
beats the hell out of a courtroom.
you know, she brought muffins.
it's her day off. She's doing homework.
in a hospital? - Yeah. God.
get some air. See the world, right?
I think it's sweet.
it's adorable.
Dr. Webber's bugging me for another stress test.
Oh, he failed the last one two minutes in.
I know, but he's been practicing.
as soon as I get a minute I'll go check on him again.
you're on my service again? - I'm sorry.
as soon as I change, I wanna go through the computer model again before we start printing the vein.
I'm sorry. Before you do that, you're gonna have to go check on your pancreas lady,
Donna Kaufman. Not good.
we were hoping we could remove the tumor, but it's advanced further than we initially thought.
the best course of action would be to relieve your obstruction and block the nerves in the area.
that should help with the pain.
you're not even gonna try?
I'm sorry. I... wish there was more that we could do.
dealing with the pain is a lot better than nothing.
let's do that.
okay. - Okay.
sooner is better.
we've been treating him with diuretics and beta blockers, but he's still got a lot of edema.
he'll rally once we put in the graft.
then we can get him out of here.
poor kid's been here for almost three weeks.
you done with all the test prints?
Yeah, uh, we finished them last night.
Shane's printing out the real one now.
Emma's here...
with muffins.
Owen's chick? You wanna get rid of her? - No.
I'm... glad he's... getting laid.
you know, everyone should be getting laid.
I should be getting laid. - Oh, here we go again.
my work suffers when I'm not. It's bad for humanity.
all right, can you make up with Mer so I don't have to talk to you about sex?
why are you being such a priss?
don't you talk to your guy friends about sex?
who? Avery? No.
well, you don't talk about who's got the best rack in the shack?
maybe. - So you can do it with me.
okay, fine. Your work's suffering so bad, then, um, find something to play with.
get your yayas out and leave me alone.
what like... battery-operated?
no, human.
a human sex toy? - You asked.
how long you been there?
somewhere around "yayas." - That's great.
we have a problem.
our conduit's contaminated.
how the hell did that happen?
I don't know.
I can print another one and try vacuum seeding, but it'll take longer.
we won't be able to do the procedure today.
I don't know if this kid can hang on for one more day.
we gotta try, right? It's still his best shot.
I'll talk to Karev.
Dr. Grey's supposed to have the printer by 10: 00 A. M. today.
we made the schedule and made a big stink about how she had to stick to it.
Edwards! Hey! Uh, can you write down - your mailing address for me? - Sure.
I'm sending you an invitation to my wedding.
thought about doing them online.
it's better for the environment, I know.
but I just couldn't deal with an evite to my wedding.
great! I really hope you'll come.
and, um, obviously, you can also, like, bring a guest.
his B. P.'s in the toilet. If this procedure's not ready, you gotta come up with something else.
it's one day. Can you relax?
God, maybe you're the one who needs a little - recreational energy release. - I'm getting laid.
regularly.
so all my anxiety is based on the fact that you brought me on this case and asked me to keep a kid alive long enough for you to do a fancy procedure that's not gonna work.
all right, maybe it's nothing.
but maybe it's worth having a conversation with somebody in psych.
Oh, you're making a mountain out of... - Look, it can't hurt!
look, hell, I'd like to have a sit-down with somebody and talk a couple things out every now and then.
well, then you go. I have a busy schedule.
navel gazing is not on it. - That's my point.
overloading your schedule can exacerbate the kind of behaviors you've been...
I'm not having behaviors! I'm having a life.
like you used to have when you were pursuing something that challenged you.
Bailey, you have time for an ex-lap?
I got a burn patient with a surgical abdomen.
Absolutely. - Trauma two!
what do we got? - Ella Holmes, 6,hit by a car, tachycardic and hypotensive.
she was on her scooter. She knows she's not supposed to ride it down the hill. I don't know what happened.
show me the ultrasound. - Is she gonna be okay?
are you her mom? - They're out of town.
intraperitoneal free fluid.
call C. T. and book an O. R. just in case. - Dr. Robbins?
she's got a supracondylar femur fracture.
okay, call Torres.
is that gonna be okay?
Yeah, we're on the mend.
I'm glad to hear it.
Murphy, go with Torres and Robbins.
it's not a good idea. - It'll be fine.
I don't think... - Murphy!
pressure's dropping!
what is that? - I can't wait for a C. T. prep her for the O. R.
I have to call her parents. What am I supposed to tell them?
I'll update you as soon as we know.
all right, let's move, people. - Let's go.
but is... is everything going to be okay?
it's all going to be fine.
OK, can you pull that lap pad out and see if there's any bleeding?
slowly.
I don't see anything.
good.
Dr. Torres is gonna fix the femur?
Yeah, but she'll need some help so you should stick around.
well, you'll help her, right?
I mean, you don't think she needs two people.
you're a resident.
you're supposed to beg to be in that room.
I'm sorry if it's awkward.
I hope that it doesn't have to be.
you two are definitely getting back together?
we are.
like you're trying it out or like... - Leah.
you don't wanna be the person who says, "I'll wait for you in case it doesn't work out with your wife."
so you're trying to find a woman for him to be with once you've passed.
I know it sounds strange.
but I don't want him to be alone.
and if he's on his own, I don't think he'll do it.
it's certainly unusual. But I understand.
you love your husband.
it's... it's not my husband.
I mean, I love my husband.
but this is for someone else... Stan.
he's a very special friend.
Donna, I'm gonna need to get at that left arm.
Yeah, it's a lot more versatile.
well, it's an improvement, no question.
maybe if you have time over lunch, you can look over the proposal.
I wish I could, I've got back-to-back surgeries.
how's it feel to be back in the anesthesia game?
it's fine.
not ideal, but, you know, got a family.
you make compromises.
Yeah, Meredith is gonna kill me.
what? She doesn't like an symmetrical array?
I'm supposed to be downshifting, and she's supposed to be upshifting.
Ah, and yet you find inspiration in toothpaste.
maybe next time, you keep it to yourself.
that works for you?
in a marriage? Yes. You keep your mouth shut.
although, uh, kinda... Miranda's been, uh, kind of struggling lately.
she has what, uh, if you squint real hard looks a lot like O. C.D.
Yeah, she had that incident with the hole in the gloves.
I knew it freaked her out, but I was away.
I didn't know how much it freaked her out.
you really think it's O. C.D?
I don't know.
I wanted to let her deal with it her way, but I'm not sure she's dealing with it.
we were in the O. R. the other day, - and she kept the patient under easily an extra hour. - Ben...
she went past that. - I... I... I'm not sure...
no, I know, I know. I should stay out of it.
but when I'm watching a surgeon perform what looks like unnecessary procedures...
I am on the board of this hospital.
I can't hear about a physician's misconduct and not report it.
I think you telling Dr. Grey is gonna go over better than...
no, I don't have time to manage her feelings right now.
just apologize, we feel terrible, it won't happen again.
she'll be pissy, but she'll get over it.
well, I could have Edwards tell her.
she's on her service. - Even better.
if you ever need any... yaya extraction...
getting the yayas out...
I'm available.
are you offering to service me?
sorry. It was inappropriate.
it's just, you know, for the sake of the work.
that's even worse.
you're supposed to claim that you're in love with me or something.
well, I certainly find you attractive.
there's no question. I mean, - I wouldn't be so presumptuous as to assume... - Stop talking.
good.
Hey, are those left over from the morning meeting?
Unh-unh, she baked them.
you're kidding. I kind of hate you.
Yeah, I kinda hate me, too.
hmm. If she's cooking your Thanksgiving dinner, I want the leftovers.
Oh, I'm not... - Oh, we're not...
well, I mean... we could.
no, you don't have to say that.
I... I hadn't given it much thought so...
sorry. I didn't mean to open a can of worms.
I just... I mean, you could do what we do at my house, which is act like it's not even happening.
so you're... you're not going home to your family, or...
I'm on call the next day.
Oh. Well, we could do something.
Oh, they're painting my apartment next week.
and we can't really cook in the trailer.
why not? We could just eat outdoors, and...
in November? - Yeah.
you could cook at my house.
you'd have to feed us, too, but...
that could be fun.
