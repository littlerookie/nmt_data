you know, he's been consistent for 30 years.
and all of a sudden, you're a whole new girl.
so... cut him some slack.
sit down and have a conversation.
give him room to be a little shocked.
I hate you.
cause I'm right and I'm awesome.
thanks for being my tour guide through all this first-day madness.
well, we both got assigned zone five, so... - I know it's not like you had any choice.
still, you're a peach to pretend otherwise.
being the new kid is... - A little scary, I know.
of course, you were here when psycho-intern cabal was marching around chopping out each other's organs.
now that must have been scary.
I'm Dr. Kepner. - Oh, handcuff
I'm not an ax murderer.
I just broke in to someone's house.
dude came after me with a golf club, beat the crap out of me.
look, you don't need the cop. I can barely move.
roll him. - Oh, we'll keep the cop.
he's got multiple contusions and ecchymosis over his back.
he's gonna need lumbar and thoracic films.
down.
okay, and by the way, it was one organ--an appendix. It wasn't a psycho cabal.
good to know.
Hey, Sarah.
Dr. Stevens. - Okay, I have to go. The doctors are here.
my sister and her daughters want you all to promise them it's a good kidney.
it's a good kidney.
there, all right? Bye.
uh, Sarah Fremont, age 27. End-stage renal disease.
on dialysis for three years, waiting for a kidney.
she's down to her last access site.
that's the polite way of saying they've run out of places to stick the needles.
ms. Fremont has a subclavian catheter for access.
why is this not ideal?
it's difficult to obtain sufficient blood flow through... You guys raise hands.
Frank Nusbaum, 42, multiple, mostly superficial stab wounds.
vital signs stable.
his buddy's got a lacerated palm.
got it. Thanks, Ray. - I'm not his buddy!
he touched my little girl, my baby!
she's not a baby.
she's 19 years old.
there ain't a scrap of baby left there, Don.
on three. One, two, three.
okay, okay, we got a bleeder here.
uh, draw me up some lidocaine and, uh, get me a lac tray with 3-0 silk.
need any help?
sir, this is gonna pinch.
he came at me with a carving knife.
he tried to cut off my-- come on. I was gesturing!
you ran into the knife.
you're an idiot and a pervert. - Tie.
she used to babysit your brats.
I can't believe I ever let her in your house!
I love her, Don.
I love her, and she loves me.
I'm gonna kill him.
easy, all right?
let him die. Just let him die.
it's what he deserves.
can you shut him up?
are you sure there's nothing I can do-- There.
you know what? That's how we do it on our side of town.
nice try. This is my zone. He's my patient.
yet I'm the one actually helping him.
how long have you been having stomach pains?
uh, a few days now.
um, they keep getting worse.
my dad a fell a couple of months ago, had a stable hip fracture-- Cuse me.
this is my patient. - Not anymore.
fine. Good luck doing an h&p without a chart.
I'll just add this to the chart later.
if you can find it.
this is the nurses' lounge.
it is literally always someone's birthday, so if you're nice to the nurses, you will get cake.
the lab.
how's the I. L.-2 going, Dr. S.. Good?
good.
I. L.-2, huh?
are you feeling-- stable for now.
and you don't want anyone to know because they'll be blown away by the fact that you're already back at work and they'll only be able to think of you as some sort of awesome super woman, which clearly, you are.
okay, you know what?
the fake flattery?
it's kinda gross.
you want to know something deeply personal about me?
you see that girl? Her name's Reed.
I have the biggest crush in the world on her, and she doesn't even know I'm alive.
she calls me Charlie.
nobody named Charlie ever got the girl-- Charlie Brown, Charlie Manson.
I'm not trying to minimize your cancer or anything, but this really sucks for me.
you like her?
I love her.
what's that?
the code to the research library.
while performance has been evaluated, the largest considerations have been budgetary.
this is the speech we want you to use when you're firing staff-- these exact words. Don't deviate.
I'm not using your speech to fire people, and I don't need an H.R.Chaperone.
thank you for your time.
chief, are you familiar with Megan Nowlan?
mm, yes, yeah.
uh, she was an intern.
she was married to Steve Mostow.
I fired her. I know how to fire people.
I don't like it, but I know how to do it, and I do it well.
you used an e-mail to fire her, and now she's suing the hospital for wrongful termination, claims she was fired because she was pregnant.
so... this is the speech.
don't deviate.
T&l spine films showed a burst fracture at t-12.
and here you can see evidence of instability because the veebral height loss is greater than 50%, which implies both A.L.L. and P.L.L. are disrupted.
what's that mean?
I got a broken back?
I'll still be able to walk, right?
you will still be able to walk, burgle, have a full life. Ideas?
decompression via corpectomy and reconstruction with strut graft and anterior instrumentation.
I might be out of my league here.
well, she has a photographic memory.
we're all out of that league.
and here I was thinking you could do transpedicle screws with a posterior approach.
seemed like a good idea, but, you know, maybe not.
let's go with the pedicle screws.
okay, get him into pre-op, and let me know when his test results come back.
I'm on it.
Frank. Oh, my god.
honey, are you okay?
I'll be fine, sweetheart.
get off of her, you perv!
daddy.
I will kill you, you son of a bitch!
security! stop!
nice work. Thanks.
I got it from here.
cool. Awesome.
you da man.
tackle like that, you had to play football.
I played a little in college.
safety? - And wide receiver, yeah.
offense and defense. Impressive.
c-can you bring that guy over later?
I want to thank him.
he saved my life.
no, I saved your life.
I'm still saving it.
you paged? - Yes. I ran a C.T. on your guy with the tummy ache.
turns out he has an adrenal mass.
thought you might want to see the scans.
I was waiting until I got the lab results to order a C. T.
you stole my lab results?
and look, now I get a surgery for all my trouble.
excuse me, Dr. Karev, my dad and I have some more questions.
he's still pretty upset.
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Thanks.
I'll take those.
you gonna fight back at some point or just let her bury you?
she's not burying me.
she's new. She's just finding her footing.
she found her footing on the back of your neck.
what do you care?
I don't know.
I like you.
no, I like that. Stop. That's good.
find her open window.
everyone has one-- a weak spot, undefended.
an open window or a key hidden in a fake rock, that's how I do it.
Yeah, well, you're a criminal, and I'm not.
it's not a crime to do to her what she's doing to you.
which is what, exactly?
making you look liken idiot.
have you talked to any of them? - Who?
the Mercy Westers.
Yeah. - And?
and... I love you.
no, not that.
I need to know what's going on out there.
I need to know how Cristina's doing.
she was cardio deprived and depressed.
are you and Cristina in a dark and twisty place?
are you having the dark and twisties?
we are.
both of you are dark and twisty?
I told you, we are.
okay.
uh, excuse me. Dr. Hunt, uh, you paged me?
your patient was having neurologic symptoms and you didn't notice, Karev?
well, I-- lucky for you Dr. Adamson did and correctly diagnosed carotid stenosis.
book an O.R. for the afternoon.
what about the surgery for his adrenal tumor?
your dad has a 90% blockage in his right carotid artery.
we need to operate on that first.
now I know that's a lot to digest, but Dr. Adamson here will keep you informed, all right?
with all due respect, Dr. Hunt, Mr. Goldman is my patient.
I found the tumor-- yeah, and when I operate on the tumor, you can scrub in on that.
in the meantime, I want you to help Dr. Adamson the patient for the C.E.A..
sir-- Whatever she needs, Karev.
neurologic symptoms?
you didn't put that in the chart.
Oh, I didn't?
all right, fine. I-I get it.
I sprang this on you. It was a lot to take in. And...
you feel like you don't have much experience with gay people, even though uncle Berto hasn't been single for 60 years for no reason.
Calliope-- It's still an adjustment.
that said... you should've adjusted by now.
I mean, you're supposed to love me no matter what.
that's... what a parent does.
I love you with all my heart.
but with all that's going on with you now, it's... look, I'm scared for you.
it's an abomination.
it's an eternity in hell.
let's not start with words like "hell."
Oh, that's why you flew 3, 000 miles, to tell me was going to hell?
I thought you came here to apologize.
I can't apologize, Calliope.
I don't understand what happened or where I went wrong.
where you went wrong?
okay, Leviticus.
thou shalt not lie with a man as one lies with a female.
Oh, don't do that, daddy.
don't quote the bible at me. - "It is an abomination."
Romans, "But we know that the law" -- Jesus
he who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone.
so you admit it's a sin?
"Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy" -- Jesus.
"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see god" -- Jesus.
"Blessed are those who have been persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
Jesus is my savior, daddy, not you.
and Jesus would be ashamed of you for judging me!
he would be ashamed of you for turning your back on me.
he would be ashamed.
with this kind of injury, there is a chance that you could end up with severe weakness in your legs.
that's okay.
I carry the stuff out with my arms, not my legs.
this is serious, Billy.
you're gonna fix me up fine.
listen... I've got a present for you.
you stole her notebook?
keep it down. You want my cop all over this?
don't you get it?
this is her open window.
I don't--I don't want her open window.
you're not just a good doctor.
you're a great doctor.
Oh, my god.
I think it's the nose, but it could be the boobs. What do you think?
g-give it back to her, and stop reading it.
future of medicine alert.
you haven't seen my notebook anywhere, have you?
small, red, I was-- I was holding it all morning.
um, um, I'm not sure.
um-- so much for that photographic memory.
good luck finding it.
this blows.
getting your ass kicked?
shut up. I hear yours got a standing ovation in the E.R.
yours is the one who saved the whole E.R. from the maniac with the hammer?
okay, he didn't save anyone.
he did some stupid ninja leap and then tripped a guy.
I used actual medicine to stop a person from dying.
well, mine has a notebook, a notebook that she takes notes in, notes of a very personal nature, and I stole it.
you what? - give it.
no. No, I-I am not sinking to their level.
they are vindictive and they are aggressive and--and they are not team players.
and if we are not cared, that spirit is going to infect our hospital.
we have to fight it.
which is why you stole her notebook?
and read it?
well, she's not a very nice person.
Oh, score.
you rock.
Oh, no. That's not for you. Who's it for then?
your Mercy Wester?!
they're handing us our asses on a plate, and you're serving 'em coffee?
Charles is actually kind of awesome.
and if you all could get past your sad, little egos, you would realize, you can't write off all of the Mercy West residents just 'cause you feel threatened.
we don't feel threatened. - No.
Yeah, we feel pretty threatened.
they're not here.
Hallelujah.
they're not eating.
they're working.
Oh, my god. They don't eat lunch. - Oh, god!
Wh-what's going on?
pulsatile mass over the stab wound. What are we looking at, Dr. Avery?
can't be sure without an angio, but I think it's a pseudoaneurysm.
I think you're right. Keep pressure on it.
let's get him up to angio, and if it's positive, you're scrubbing in.
thank you, sir. - But that's my patient.
he was here, and you weren't.
Dr. Hunt! - What?
Cristina, what?
what? You know what? That doesn't matter that that's my patient or my surgery?
you're prioritizing based on some sort of random code, some stupid rule you have not to favor me?
this--this is one surgery.
forget it.
the woman does whatever I ask.
I want something... she gets it for me.
the research library?
anytime you want to go in, it's closed, just say the word.
she gave me the code to the place.
you're kidding. She can't do enough for me.
it's like I have my own surgical bitch.
didn't go well, huh?
well, at least now I can move on with my life.
stop entertaining any thoughts of actually getting back together with my family.
whatever. I don't need a father.
I don't... not one who won't accept me.
I know.
well, his vital signs are fine.
B. P. looks good.
I hurt.
the neck... blood... - what?
in head... ple... 12.
what's happening here? - I'm not sure.
we're gonna have to, uh, hold off on the O.R.
pathetic.
look, he just said a bunch of weird crap, okay?
he has expressive aphasia, which means Broca's area, which is the left side of the brain.
you said it was the right side that was blocked.
5% of people have Broca's on the right.
you want to take that chance?
what if it's a brain met from the tumor?
Oh, right. Because you diagnosed a tumor, now it's a met.
I've seen this before. Have you?
your behavior has been disgusting.
I mean, all you've done all day is take pleasure in how the other one got it wrong, how they screwed it up.
this is my father... my father.
and... and you are supposed to be healers.
that's what you're job's supposed to be, to heal people.
we're gonna run some more tests, ma'am.
we're... very sorry.
thank you.
Dr. Stevens, can I talk to you for a minute? - Go away.
picked up the labs for you. If you want, I can take care of the dialysis.
I've got this.
I don't need a surgical bitch. Thanks.
Izzie, it wasn't personal.
that stuff, it just... comes with the job.
I'd expect you to do the same thing to me.
outside of work, you can be friends.
but inside, it's a whole different story.
at least it was at Mercy West.
well, that isn't how it is here.
here, we don't just think about ourselves.
we support one another. We have each other's backs.
we--we throw ourselves in front of buses to save the lives of complete strangers.
you will never measure up to the people we've lost.
let's do a 140-base sodium, 37-base biocarb and a zero-k bath with an ultrafiltration of 3. 5 liters.
Cristina-- Cristina. Cristina, talk to me.
no. - Cristina.
he wouldn't... - what happened?
here.
talk to me. Tell me what happened.
nothing.
nothing is happening to me.
you know, I don't-- I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm, like, chasing after surgeries I don't care about.
do you know how long it's been since I've held a heart in hand...
since I felt that... that joy, that rush?
you know... I miss Burke.
I-I m--I miss him all day.
I miss--you know, I-I-- it's--it's not the relationship or--or the sex.
I miss...
every day when he was here, I held hearts.
and I got picked, not because of some favoritism, but because it was just, like, it was right.
and I learned. I learned.
and I felt seen.
and now you know what? I don't know what.
I spent this entire day fighting...
and I-I don't want to do it anymore.
come over here.
where are we at with Billy Sheehan?
he's ready. I helped put him under. He's prepped and positioned.
I thought we said I was handling that.
Oh, yeah, we did. I just wanted to make absolutely sure everything was ready for Dr. Shepherd.
well, your first day here, and already you're making my life easier.
Yeah, Dr. Kepner-- No, she's not just a good doctor.
she's--she's a great doctor.
in fact, if you ask me, she's the future of medicine.
only you can keep yourself down, right?
by the way, I can tell.
D-Dr. Shepherd, I just need a moment.
look at this.
acute on chronic subdural hematoma.
that's not mets.
no, it's a brain bleed.
which would explain the aphasia and the numbness.
it would explain everything.
I'll tell neuro.
Oh, no. Nice try. I'll tell neuro.
I'm the one that said it was a brain issue.
the only reason why you knew that was because I got a ball rolling by diagnosing the carotid stenosis.
can't you give it a rest? Didn't you hear what Goldman's daughter said?
sorry.
I'll stop if you stop.
I've stopped. You can have it.
talk to Arizona Robbins-- she's head of neuro.
she's not really head of neuro, is she?
what the hell happened?!
push another 2 of ativan now.
get me new chemistries and an E.K.G.
get the crash cart in here now.
start ventilating her.
torsades? You gave her torsades?
what the hell did you do to her?
I didn't do anything. You were the one who was with her last.
page Bailey. - I already did.
clear. Clear!
I don't know you well enough to talk about her.
we're not gonna do that.
most people think that I was named for the state, but it's not true.
I was named for a battleship--the "U.S.S. Arizona."
my grandfather was serving on the Arizona when the Japanese bombed pearl harbor, and he saved... 19 men before he drowned.
pretty much everything my father did his whole life was about honoring that sacrifice.
I was raised to be a good man in a storm, raised to love my country, love my family and protect the things I love.
when my father... Colonel Daniel Robbins of the United States Marine Corps, heard that I was a lesbian, he said he only had one question.
I was prepared for "how fast can you get the hell out of my house?"
but instead... it was...
are you still who I raised you to be?
my father believes in country the way that you believe in god.
and my father is not a man who bends, but he bent for me because I'm his daughter.
I'm a good man in a storm.
I love your daughter, and I protect the things I love.
not that I need to. She doesn't need it.
she's strong and caring... and honorable.
and she's who you raised her to be.
she's alive, barely.
is she still gonna get the kidney?
I'm asking the questions right now, Stevens.
Dr. Percy here tells me that you were in charge of Sarah's dialysis.
is that true? - Yes.
he also says that you were pretty upset with him.
I don't see what that has to do with anything.
it has to do with the fact that your mental state may have clouded your judgment, may have made you a less competent doctor, may have led you to read the labs wrong or not read them at all.
otherwise, why would you tell the tech to give Sarah a zero-k bath when her potassium this morning was 3. 4?
you sucked all the potassium out of that woman.
you stopped her heart.
she's alive, but she's not getting her kidney.
after three years of waiting, somebody else will be getting her kidney.
and if we don't find her another one in the next three days, she's going to be dead, and you will have killed her.
Ah, the surgery went pretty well, Mr. Sheehan.
we had good bone alignment.
and I'll be back to my old self?
I'll be able to get around?
get around? Yes.
uh, to where you were? No, probably not.
probably about 70%, which is good considering your injuries.
I guess that means I only steal 70% as much stuff.
you see this?
I noticed this afternoon there were splotches all over the page, and... they're tears.
she was crying when she wrote this stuff.
she's scared.
and--and these stupid little sayings, they make her feel better.
this is her comfort.
we stole her comfort from her.
you and me, we're-- we're taking things from people, and we're leaving them at 70%.
you promised.
you promised my nieces I was getting this kidney.
I'm sorry. I am... so, so sorry.
but I am going to make this right.
I'm going to get you another kidney.
it's my sister.
what do I tell her?
I'm sorry.
it must be hard, being the new people, being the invaders.
but that's no excuse for you being a...
look, I-I don't like you.
but what I did... that was over the line.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you wanted to see me.
this is Missy Grant from human resources.
you're kidding me.
you're firing me?
Stevens-- You can't do that.
you can't fire me for-- for having cancer.
I'm pretty sure that that's five kinds of illegal.
this is not about the cancer.
it's about the kidney patient?
I made a mistake. I...
but doctors make mistakes in this hospital every day.
Yes, but when there's-- you let me come back after I cut an l-vad wire.
that was a different era.
times have changed.
Dr. Shepherd and Dr. Hunt... had concerns about your stamina and emotional stability.
and Dr. Karev has questions about-- Alex?
Alex said something to you?
Dr. Webber.
in the wake of the merger with Mercy West, the needs of the hospital have changed.
while performance is evaluated... the largest considerations are budgetary.
there was simply no room on the staff.
please don't do this to me.
please don't take this away from me.
I don't have anything left.
please.
what do you do when the infection hits you...
when it takes over?
I can't do this anymore. You'll, you know, see me in hell.
listen to me, please.
I have to catch you.
what?
your whole life, you... you've always been on a bridge, Calliope, ever since you were a little girl.
and you don't just walk on it either.
no, you climb on the railing and you're-- you're ready to leap.
and when you do, when that happens...
I have to be there, I have to catch you.
you don't have to catch me, dad.
Yes, I do.
it's my job.
if this works out between you and Arizona... is there a chance that maybe you'd, uh... give your mother a wedding?
I think last night if Arizona wanted to spend the rest of her life with me?
Yeah, I'll put on a big white dress and dance down the aisle.
how-- how about grandkids?
Yes, I would imagine...
when the time came... there would be kids.
does she make you happy?
Yes, dad.
she makes me very happy.
I love you. You know that?
she's not a vegetarian, is she?
because I-I don't know how much more I can take.
she's not a vegetarian.
I feel very old.
do you do what you're supposed to and take your medicine?
or do you learn to live with the thing...
and hope someday it goes away?
tell me everything.
did you beat them?
did you kick their asses?
come on. I want a full report. Everything that happened.
Izzie left me.
she wrote a note and she left me.
I...
I don't--I don't-- I don't know if she's coming back.
wh-what do you mean, she left? Where did she go?
go hug him. - what?
go hug him.
number one rule of surgery is limit exposure.
good.
keep your hands clean,
your incisions small
and your wounds covered.
I've removed the tumor And placed the catheters.
now i'm going to flood the abdomen with heated chemo.
it allows a greater concentration of drug To be delivered directly to the affected ea.
and the heat helps target the cancer cells While leaving the normal cells virtually unaffected.
okay, start perfusion.
okay, uh, we'll place him in trendelenburg.
then reverse trendelenburg As we agitate the abdomen
to make sure that the chemo really washes everywhere.
okay, she saw me. Now I can go.
she's just getting started.
Yeah, I have a headache. I need coffee.
I have a cure for a headache that doesn't involve coffee.
there's a seat right there. -Oh, thanks.
I've never seen a hot chemo lavage before.
it's fascinating.
I thought you were leaving.
the chief asked me to finish out my contract, Which has a few more weeks.
number two rule of surgery...
is when rule number one stops working...
try something else...
what I said, I didn't mean.
you mean offering to trade Owen like a horse Or a baseball card
or--or a stale peanut butter sandwich from your lunch box.
it was thoughtless-- Fine.
fine.
Cristina, let's just forget about it.
because sometimes you can't limit exposure.
sometimes the injury is so bad That you have to cut and cut big.
No! -Yes!
no. If you report him- - He's an alcoholic!
if you report him, it'll be the end of his career.
you don't give people any room.
flaws are unacceptable to Mc dreamy.
don't "Mcdreamy" me. -Mcdreamy is being mcass.
he is an alcoholic. How long has he been drinking?
since the holidays?
what, do you want to take notes so you can show it to the board
so they can offer you his job on the spot?
you want his job. You know it and I know it.
I'm the head of neurosurgery. I have a responsibility to this hospital.
admit you want to be chief.
you know what? I'm done having this argument.
I'm going to the board. I'm reporting richard.
post-it.
you can't call post-It.
I am calling post-It Because I told my secret about my friend to my husband
not the head of neurosurgery, my husband-- Which I have to be able to do.
so the laws of post-It clearly prevail.
this is wrong. -Post-It.
the chief-- Post-It.
fine. I won't tell.
fine.
damn it. You just make me want to...
Oh, Izzie's coming home.
I have to tell Alex.
I won't go to the board.
I won't say a word.
just think about what I said.
okay.
Alex, Izzie's... Coming...
Izzie's coming? -Home.
Oh, crap.
Izzie leaves, and Mark gets a kid,
and you two decide that the best way to deal Is to get drunk and mash your genitals together?
look, no freakin' way You get to judge us or give relationship advice.
besides, you were a total dirty mistress, Like, two weeks ago.
are we calling me a dirty mistress?
that was two years ago, and his wife didn't have cancer.
because I've only been with, like, six guys in my whole life.
okay, Alex and I-- We've done it before. that was recycling.
it was, like, good for the environment.
Izzie's gone, I was horny, she was there.
Oh, crap. I am a dirty mistress.
Oh, god. You're gonna tell Derek, and then Derek's Gonna tell Mark that i'm a whore.
no, I am not going to tell Derek, And neither are you, and you're not gonna say anything.
we are keeping our mouths shut.
Izzie is coming home. No one needs to know.
Hi.
know what?
there were no sterile supplies in the O. R.Last night. -I heard.
surgery came to a complete stop for a full hour.
central supply and maintenance are understaffed, And the autoclaves have been breaking down.
now anything else?
I want to help.
look, I don't need your help, Derek.
the sterilizers are up and running, so
not the hospital.
you.
you stopped operating.
you're not teaching anybody but Meredith.
I'm wondering if...
if you need some help.
no shame in asking. You know that.
you can help...
by doing your own job and letting me do mine.
anything else? -No.
I'm done.
so I went to the, uh, to the trailer.
Yeah, I don't--I don't live in the trailer anymore.
Yeah.
so...
Meredith called me and told me you might be moving on.
Iz-- Okay, just...
just wait.
I realize now That i was wrong to blame you for getting fired.
I'm sorry. It wasn't yourlt.
I ju-- I don't want to have some big talk.
look, I gotta go to work.
I have a pet-scan later, So maybe i'll see you at the hospital?
is everything okay? -Yeah.
Yeah, I found some residencies with open spots and applied.
they all just want to make sure I'm stable.
one of them is close.
it's in Tacoma, so...
we'd be okay.
I could commute from here and...
I know that you don't want to have some big talk, but i just can't leave here
look, seriously, I have to get to the hospital.
the place really sucks these days.
you should be happy you don't work there anymore.
sorry. -Don't be.
I am happy. I'm gonna work in Tacoma, and it's gonna be awesome.
you're gonna be jealous.
you're operating? -I am.
a whipple. That's big.
I say, go big...
or go home.
uh, excuse me, sir?
you're--you're taking Dr. Bailey's whipple?
is that a problem? -No, not at all.
no, I'm-- I'm the resident on the case.
I'm thrilled to be assisting you.
I-I will be assisting you, right?
you can open.
that way, Dr. Grey will be fresh When she dissects the neck of the pancreas From the portal vein.
that's the hardest part.
that's a fifth-year procedure.
it's what we've been practicing.
and I'm telling you, you're ready.
but if you don't think you're ready
no, no. I'm ready. I'm ready.
what's going on?
hunt's got an M. V.C. In here.
use a hand?
what?
can I help?
you know what you can do first? You can make that stop.
dude! Stop singing!
I'm trying to get you people to understand The seriousness of the problem.
I've lost my upper register completely.
Dr. Karev, this is Mr. Mafrici, your consult.
I just need some antibiotics.
I open in "tosca" in a week, and he gave me bronchitis.
I did not give this to you.
take a deep breath.
he teaches piano tochildren.
I can hear them hacking away during their lessons,
and then he comes in the house and touches things.
stop talking.
he's got decreased breath sounds on the left side. He's gonna need an X-Ray.
can you take him up?
page an intern. I don't have time.
hunt took him up, Said thanks for your help.
you got time now?
you're hot. -You're hot, too.
no, you're...
hot" hot.
okay. Thanks.
no. No, no. You have a fever.
you have a--You have a-- You have a fever.
what is that? -What?
Oh, my god. -What?
pox. Pox. You have chickenpox.
turns out she loves Owen And thought she came here to be all, you know,"Teddy and Owen,
but there's me, And now she's all pain and threatening to leave,
and so I told her she could have him.
what?
she's an amazing teacher, and I'm, You know, I'm happy again, and I'm--I'm in the O. R.
and I'm feeling like myself and--And I
and, of course, I didn't mean it.
I mean, I love Owen. I-I love him.
but that means that I don't get to have her, So...
maybe I meant it?
okay, here's the thing-- You can't talk like this.
it's, like, I get you... -Yeah.
but other people don't, so you can't talk like this.
I-I mean, it's--It's crazy.
it's, like, um, if you tell someone their baby is ugly.
you know, they know it, you know it, everybody knows it,
but you don't talk about it.
okay, but--But you're saying surgery, right?
gun to your head, you would choose surgery over Derek?
I am saying don'talk about this.
and don't talk about it to Owen.
Oh, little Grey? That's the world -Class specialist you wanted me to see?
okay, little Grey has had the chickenpox vaccine.
I snooped through your personnel file.
I, on the other hand, Have not, nor did I ever have them as a child.
you're a pediatrician. How have you never had the
no, I am a pediatric surgeon.
I don't do little diseases on little people.
I do big surgeries on little people.
Oh, you know what? This is ridiculous. I'm going home.
no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
you're not going anywhere.
you're highly contagious right now.
you leave this room, and you're gonna touch doorknobs and elevator buttons, and then you'll be the outbreak monkey.
I'm going to kill you.
I love you.
stop scratching, cause you're just gonna make it worse, and then you're gonna scar.
I gotta get my hands on a body again, mer.
I think I'm gonna get an offer from Oregon, but I can't take it.
it's too far. I can't do that to Alex.
I gotta get this Tacoma thing.
Oh, you know what would help? A call from Derek shepherd, head of neurosurgery.
talk to him.
talk to me about what?
she's up a for a job in Tacoma, And she wants you to call.
Tacoma? It isn't even ranked in the top 20.
Yeah, but it close, and she can repair things with alex.
fine. Have her give me the number.
I read the board.
the chief is doing a whipple, and you're scrubbing in.
well, you can stop worrying. He's fine.
he hasn't operated in months,
and his first surgery back is a 7-hour procedure With a 20% complication rate.
first you were worried that he wasn't operating.
now you're pissed that he is. -I don't trust him anymore.
Meredith-- Post-It.
he's fine. He's fine.
I thought it was infection, right? Like pneumonia?
Oh, that's one of the possibilities.
what are the others?
well, the fluid could also indicate-- Yang.
Karev made the diagnosis. Let him talk.
heart failure and cancer could also cause This much fluid to occur.
cancer?
would you have to remove myung?
aaron, he just said cancer is only a possibility.
I sing.
it's my entire life.
besides me.
what you meant to say was that singing was your entire life besides me.
you heard the chief is operating today?
took my whipple And is having Meredith grey do the pancreatic dissection
a procedure that I performed for the first time Just last year.
the chief's judgment...
is not clear and rational.
Miranda, there's nothing I can do.
you're the only one who can.
I performed Intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemo this morning,
and I kept looking up into the gallery to see if the chief was there.
I mean, that was a big deal for me.
anyway, he wasn't there.
and I don't know why I thought he would show, Because the truth is...
he's gone.
and he's been gone a long time.
Arizona thought some work Might take your mind off your itching.
scratching will take my mind off of itching.
take off my gauze paws.
she said that you'd say that, and that I should say no.
so how about we start with the tibial plateau fracture, room 22-40?
I'm an attending. You're a resident.
as your superior, I'm ordering you to take them off.
she said that you would say that, too.
and technically, I'm on her service today, So she's my boss, not you.
we have the lisfranc fracture, room 22-11.
please let me scratch, Just for five minutes, just for
no. It'll scar.
I don't care. I don't care. Scars are hot.
scars are badass. Scars are poetic.
I'm begging you, little Grey.
no, and please don't call me little Grey.
I'm in pain-- "Down to the core of my being" pain, "I'm going crazy" pain,"Scary, will this ever go away" pain.
do--do you get that?
Do--do--do you know what i-- Do you know what i mean when i--When i say that?
because this pain is "nd to scratch an itch that I ca-- I can't scratch,
the pain of a thousand itches," and it's making me crazy.
not "funny" crazy. This is "bad" crazy, okay?
it's "dark" crazy. It's "make a suit out of someone else's skin" crazy, okay?
pain, little Grey. Pain.
I had sex with alex.
I had sex with alex, which I regret, Okay, completely, because I am in love with mark.
I didn't think.
but I'm scar that I can't handle the daughter And the baby and the "Mark's gonna be a grandpa" thing.
why are you telling me this?
I am in pain, too, is what I am saying.
I get your pain. Don't you e that?
I do feel your pain because I am in pain, too.
I have pox between my butt cheeks.
your "pain" does not begin to compare to mine.
okay, out. Just out!
out!
what are you talking about?-She's on this thing
you would choose Izzie, right?
because you two are gonna get back together. -Shut up.
wait, why do you have to choose?
that doesn't matter. You just do.
which is it-- Surgery or love?
I want both. -That's what I said.
no, you--You can't have both. -Why the hell not?
why the hell is he here?
I said he could be in here because he's in the whipple, too.
okay, whatever.
once again, you cannot have both. You have to choose.
choose what?
uh, my...
my petcan got pushed back an hr, So thought i'd...
join you for lunch.
okay. That.
you have to give up that-- Learning the procedure,
tuning out the world until you get it, like, you know,
doing the procedure is the only thing that matters,
like if you don't get to do it, you'll die.
that's what you have to give up.
for what? -love.
Why?
Yeah, that's what I said. -Okay, that's not the point.
you know you couldn't do it. You know you'd choose the procedur fine! If I had to choose, gun to my head, I would choose surgery.
okay? -Okay, well, thank you.
is that so hard to say?
I don't know, why is it so bad to say that out loud?
because it's crazy.
How--How-- It's crazy.
Surgery--It's just a job.
it's just a job. It's the thing you come home from, Not the thing you come home to.
and if you lose your job, you get another one, cause there's always another one.
but...
if you lose your love...
if you think you're losing your love...
well, then suddenly, nothing else matters.
this is what you guys talk about during lunch?
I'm with them.
love comes and goes.
surgery doesn't.
results are back.
you choose love.
Yes! Just did a perfect dissection Without lacerating the portal vein.
you gonna do that little fist pump in surgery, too?
the tests showed a malignancy on your left lung.
it's called pleural mesothelioma.
and it's a cancer that surrounds the lining of your lung.
so what, you--You-- You cut out his lung?
well, best-case scenario, We won't have to remove any lung tissue except for the tumor.
aaron, did you hear that? That's good.
Jeffrey, I'm not deaf.
what's the worst-case scenario?
we get in there, and the damage is too extensive, And we have to remove more.
my whole lung?
that's the worst-case scenario.
but, yes, it is a possibility.
but it's also possible they won't have to remove any.
okay? So let's stay positive.
will you please shut up?
I can't take your cheerful little voi Shoving positive thinking down my throat when my life is basically over.
people do recover from things like this.
and then they go on to-- What?
go on to what? -Live.
I won't have a lung.
I'm a singer.
so you see my problem?
you can direct. You can teach.
like you?
I'd rather die than spend two hours every day listening to mediocre music majors doing their scales.
I know that this is a lot to take in,
and if you need time to talk or get a second opinion
I want my lung.
Dr. Altman...
I'm big...
too big.
I don't fit in airplane seats, And as Jeff is always telling me, My feelings don't always fit the situation.
if my food is overcooked in a restaurant, I get enraged.
I want to kill the waiter.
but I don't.
I politely ask him to take my meal back and bring it to me the way I asked for it.
I spend my days making myself smaller, more acceptable.
and that's okay, Because at night when I go on stage,
I get to experience the world the way I feel it
with indescribable rage and unbearable sadness And huge passion.
at night, on stage, I get to kill the waiter and dance on his grave.
and If I can't do that...
if I all I have left Is a life of making myself smaller...
then I don't want to live.
I don't.
and believe me, honey, You don't nt me to live.
are you stealing sterile supplies?
I need sterile instruments.
I'm not gonna get caught with my pants down because this hospital can't get
I get it.
I want to do something... Something ...
think is...
I have a responsibility. But I just...
so what's stopping you? - Meredith.
the other half of the twisted sisters.
is that what you call Meredith and Cristina-- the twisted sisters?
Yeah.
well, that fits.
so this... This thing...
I could come out of it looking, uh...
pretty bad-- like I did it for the wrong reasons, like I did it... For myself.
you know, in my experience, nobody goes into a battle because they want to win a purple heart.
you do the right thing, and sometimes that gets you a medal, and sometimes it gets you killed.
how do you know it's the right thing?
when it's the best thing for the most people, the thing that...
keeps the most people alive.
how you doing?
a little claustrophobic.
well, focus on your breathing. That always helps.
Alex, I have to know.
when Mer called, she said you were moving on. Have you... Moved on?
I slept with someone.
damn it, Alex.
we'll get through it.
are u still there? - I'm right here.
can you hold my hand or something so I know you haven't left?
I can't reach your hand.
Oh, yeah.
I can hold your foot.
foot is good.
look, Derek, I'm busy. I have a surgery in less than an hour.
okay.
you want me to drink that?
no.
but I believe you will.
I'm gonna go, and you're gonna drink it.
you're gonna try not to, but in the end... You'll drink it.
I also believe that this wobe the first drink you drank today.
this tumor is huge. I've never seen pleura this thick.
it's like a watermelon rind.
damn it. I'm gonna have to get rid of the lung, the diaphragm and the pericardium with this tumor.
Yeah, that's... That's what I need to do.
that's what's advisable for optimal survival.
but that's not what we're gonna do. We are going to remove the visible tumor and we are going to treat the lung with
with intrapleural hyperthermic chemotherapy.
all right, Karev, find out what bailey used in the procedure this morning, and gather everything that I need.
yang, you're gonna help me remove this tumor.
uh, this morning, Bailey said the hot chemo lavage was only indicated in abdominal surgery.
well, sugarman at the Brigham has been researching its applications as it applies the pleural mesothelioma.
and he's a singer... And he needs his lung.
you lookike hell.
chickenpox.
stay back. I'm contagious.
I had 'em when i was 6.
what...
how was l. A?
well, Addison nicked one of the uterine arteries.
but she was able to fix it.
Sloan's okay, and the baby's gonna be okay, too.
Oh, good.
I slept with Addison.
I gotta tell Lexie, right?
no. - It's Lexie. She's so good.
how do you lie to a girl like that?
lie. Really? - Really. Really?
Yeah.
Oh, i hurt.
here.
I got you covered, kid.
what are you doing?
I'm gonna help you.
Oh, my g-- oh, my... Oh.
Ooh, that's amazing.
no scar.
no, keep going. Thank you.
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
you saved the lung, the whole lung?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
um... Well, now what?
well, now the work really begins.
this is gonna be a long recovery, but he should be fine.
does it make me awful to say that i'm just slightly disappointed?
I guess I was sitting out here thinking, now he's gonna be like the rest of us, who teach and direct and do all the things he finds so demeaning.
you know what's demeaning?
loving a man, taking care of him, doing his shopping, making his meals, making sure his humidifiers are clean,'cause god forbid his humidifiers aren't clean.
what's demeaning... Is loving a man who thinks so little of you.
he's got an army of nurses, so if you want to walk out of here, you can.
we'll take care of him. You could go.
I love him.
you should hear him sing.
nobody sings that well.
he does.
Yeah, see that stitch there?
you just made the dude diabetic for life.
okay, shut up. I'm trying to concentrate until the chief gets here.
Dr. Webber apologizes.
he got caught up in some sort of administrative something.
so let's dig in. Patient ready?
Yeah, we are all prepped and ready. Just waiting on you.
Dr. Grey, care to open?
Oh, actually, I was gonna open, Dr. Bailey.
okay, sure.
uh, Dr. Webber was going to let me do the pancreatic neck dissection, so I've prepped.
I don't believe you're ready for that.
I'll be doing it.
you're welcome to observe.
go ahead.
10-blade.
I'm sorry you didn't get a chance to do the procedure.
something came up. It happens.
I'm not surprised about Richard, though.
you're not a dumb person, but right now, you're acting like one.
I am not going to turn him in.
Tacoma passed on Izzie.
I did my best. Just too much history, too many red flags.
if I went to the board, they'd make me chief.
the first thing I'd do is hire Stevens back.
it's your choice. It's up to you.
that should be me.
don't be jealous.
they're just friends-- best friends.
I had the chickenpox, and I told her I hadn't because...
I... I find her miraculous... Breathtakingly stunning.
just... I can't stop looking at her.
and I was afraid, with the ooze and the fevers and the scratching
I-I just--I wanted to stay in the sexy part of things.
so I lied to my girlfriend, and now... He makes scratching look sexy.
he makes everything look sexy.
so you get it.
you didn't have to do that, but you did.
you get it.
what are you talking about?
I choose surgery over a guy.
I'm not gonna apologize for it, especially to you.
you didn't have to save his lung.
the right thing would've been to remove it.
but the patient was clear that he didn't want to live without his gift, and you get that.
I choose my gift.
I want to be great, and I want to learn from you.
I choose my gift.
Hey, how'd your surgery go?
great. - See?
and you were all worried. You're a rock star.
speaking of which, do you know if Derek has talked to Tacoma yet?
no, I don't.
okay, good. Cause i just got my scans back, and they're really good.
and so it would be great if he could mention that i am officially not dying of cancer when he talks to them.
I'm gonna get this job, Mer.
I'm gonna get this job and I'm gonna get Alex back and I'm gonna be myself again.
I can feel it.
okay, I'm gonna go get Derek and show him my scans before he calls Tacoma.
okay. Uh, you know, I-- I'll go tell him--Derek.
and you go tell Alex.
okay.
okay, fine.
you can go to the board.
just...
sorry. Car crash came in. I got here as soon as i could.
Oh, that's okay.
it gave me time to get drunk.
Oh, so what's the occasion?
you know, I thought Beth was an idiot.
I mean, if we're being honest here... - I didn't know that we are.
I mean, maybe not an idiot, but just not good enough for you.
Oh, so how long you been here?
you know, I'm sure that it wasn't easy for her...
Teddy-- but do you know what she said to me once?
she said that once you guys were married, she was done.
I mean, she was done teaching and she was just gonna start making babies.
and I remember thinking to myself, wow, I mean, does Owen know you have, like, zero ambition?
and then there's Cristina.
there's Cristina, who is exactly the opposite.
I mean, it would actually be funny if it wasn't so just... Not funny.
I mean... I get it.
she... She is beautiful and talented and kind of amazing.
she's right. I get her. - Okay, I'm calling you a cab.
can I get a cab? Okay? - I get her.
come on. Let's get you home. - But she was willing to trade you...
for me.
if I stayed, she said I could have you.
how was your surgery?
uh, it was good. It was, uh, it was fine. It was...
here. Want to see?
I'm so glad. I'm so glad.
it's like it never happened.
Yeah, but it did.
it all happened, Iz.
you got cancer, and we got married, and... You died and you lived again...
and you... You left, then you came back.
and we got through it.
I got through it.
and I'm on the other side.
iz, I love you so much, and I... Till I met you, I-I used to think I just wasn't a good guy.
growing up with my family, I mean, that's what they told me.
but now... After all of it, I know that I'm a good man.
and I thank you for that, because I know now that I'm good enough not to deserve this...
not to have to feel like this...
not to love you so much that I almost hate you.
I deserve someone who will stay.
I'm happy you're okay.
and I'm happy about your job.
and I want you to go... Fear and be happy and not come back.
I'm sorry about the surgery.
I got caught up with paperwork and just-- you don't have to apologize.
you don't have to apologize for anything.
in surgery...
the healing process begins with a cut...
an incision...the tearing of flesh.
where have you been?
you just disappeared.
I left you, like, ten messages.
are you drunk?
wait. What? What? What?
you make me sad.
you think that surgery is gonna make you feel.
you think that a successful career is gonna make you happy.
you think you know things.
you know things, and nothing else matters, no one else matters.
people do matter. I matter. We... We matter.
so you don't get to toss me aside.
I won't let you.
we have to damage the healthy flesh...
in order to expose the unhealthy.
it feels cruel...
uh... How did, uh, Sloan's surgery go?
I slept with Addison.
Oh, thank go 'cause I slept with Alex.
Oh, I was feeling so-- well, you know how I was feeling...
which is why this--this-- this is great.
you know, we're---we're-- we're even.
we--we kind of canceled each other out.
you slept with Karev?
Yeah.
while I was dealing with my sick daughter?
while I was hurting?
uh, well, you weren't hurting.
you were sleeping with Addison.
you broke up with me, left me... And just... Wow.
I...I can't even look at you right now.
and against common sense.
do you know what it took for me to make this happen?
please tell Derek I'm really sorry.
this isn't about Derek. It's about me. It's about us.
you don't just walk away from people.
you don't just throw people away.
I can't, Meredith. Okay? I can't be here. Please.
please try to understand.
I have to start over. I need to start over, okay?
please don't go.
this is your home.
no, it's not, not anymore.
it's just a place I worked, and I can do that anywhere.
but it works.
you risk exposure...
dying isn't easy.
the body was designed to stay alive...
thick skulls...
strong hearts...
keen senses.
morning.
morning.
when the body starts to fail...
medicine takes over.
morning, Kim, Sean. How are you feeling?
ready. Today is the day.
how are you doing?
okay.
surgeons are arrogant enough to think...
there's no one we can't save.
Hey, you need a consult?- Uh, Kim Allan.
she had stage iv large cell lung cancer.
I removed a second mass from her|right lung about two months ago, but her tests had showed that the cancer had|spread to her lymph nodes and to her liver.
she was readmitted last|week with pulmonary edema.
I drained as much fluid as I could, but|she is still having a tough time breathing.
that's too bad. You gonna have to intubate her?
she doesn't want that.
you're gonna have to treat her palliatively. I|don't see what else we can do for her.
she wants us to help her die.
like I said, dying isn't easy.
since the state requires two physicians'|signatures, I've asked Dr. Hunt to look over your chart.
okay. Her prognosis says that she|has less than six months to live.
I have informed her of|her treatment options.
she has met with a psychologist who|has determined that she is mentally fit.
and this can serve as|her second oral request.
okay. 
you have to say it.
washington state says I have to hear|you ask two times at least 15 days apart.
it's so weird.
it's like I'm applying to die.
well, if you're having second thoughts--|you saw how bad it got last night.
it's just gonna get worse.
I would like to end my life|through physician-assisted suicide.
excuse me.
I-I'm just gonna go see what's up.
Dr. Altman. How long|does it take... To die...
once I take the barbiturates?
can we not talk about this?
it's just, um... We're not there yet.
we are there, Sean. We are.
Kim, to answer your|question... About 45 minutes.
it takes about 45 minutes to die.
three dates, no sex. Just talking.
do you have any idea how much you can|learn about someone if you remain upright?
like I'll bet you didn't know|Teddy hates the word " moist.
hates it.
would really prefer people say "damp.
you hear me?
I'm growing again. I'm, like, grown.
she's making cartilage from scratch.
she's a little preoccupied these days.
it's super hot.
I'm gonna be late. Bye.
she doesn't want kids.
Arizona doesn't want kids--|in her womb, in her house, ever.
she told me.|- What did you say?
nothing. I mean, we're doing so great.
I don't want to ruin it by being the|crazy, desperate girl with the aching womb.
better than being the crazy, childless woman who sits|out at the playground watching the children play.
they have laws for people like that.
you gotta tell her.
all right, so in the third quarter, the collection|rate of medicaid was what percent again?
would you excuse me one second?
you have 30 seconds.
okay, so this woman comes in|to the E.R.with abdominal pain.
she's had it off and|on for about six months.
and a lot of doctors have told her|it's either an ulcer or gastritis.
all right, get to the|point. You have 15 seconds.
okay, so it occurs to me that the nausea|is probably caused by a positional shift
C.S.F. Okay. Brain tumor. Got it.|- Right, but not just any brain tumor.
I mean, she's got this|huge, beautiful ependymoma.
so shadow Shepherd-- Dr. Nelson.
okay, shadow Shepherd is going to|do an intraventricular resection...
and let me assist, and I may|even get to debulk the tumor.
that's it?
okay. Sorry for the interruption.
so where were we?
how close? - Two minutes.
it's Nicole, right?
three guys waiting on an ambulance?
must be Nicole behind the wheel.
have you seen her ass?
man, I'd love to hit that.
morning, chief.
sorry about that, chief. I--that's quite all right.
and, um, I'm not the chief.
Hey, Nicole.
Nick Kelsey, 32, injured skiing off a helicopter.
vital signs are stable.
it wasn't the helicopter that did it. It was the avalanche.
idiotic either way. He's got two idiot friends coming in behind him, but he's got the worst of it
open fracture to the left tibia and left hip fracture.
what are you looking at, chachi?
what happened? We were in|the middle of a consult.
you're her doctor. You shouldn't|be pushing her to do that.
I offered her options.
I told her about hospice.
she doesn't want to die a slow death hooked up to machines|or be so heavily sedated, she might as well be dead.
and I have to say, I don't blame|her. This is an act of mercy.
Oh," an act of mercy "? You|are killing her.
just so that you are clear, by writing that|prescription, you are killing that woman.
all right, then.
I'll find someone else.
watch it. Watch it. Heads up!
you need to work on your|passing game, Hunt... Oh, yeah?
you ball hog.
well, you need work on your game!
Owen, on your four!
Oh! Go! Go! Go, go, go!
not a chance, major!
get it! Get it! Get it!
okay, watch out, watch|out, watch out! Go! Go!
I got him. I got him.
okay, break it up, break|it up. Break it up, you two.
we're only down by 3.
Oh, yeah,'cause you suck.
insubordinate.
Oh, sir, you suck, sir.
I mean, Dan. Come on, it's|true. You play like my grandma.
whatever.
get your battle rattle.
it's time to go to work.
Owen, come on.
I need to reduce this ankle dislocation.
give him 10 of morphine.
I need to treat his frostbite. Nick, you|like the tips of your fingers?
Yes, please.
you jumped out of a helicopter on skis?
Yeah. You can't get powder|like that anywhere else.
I'm seeing fluid around your kidney.
we're gonna need to do a C.T. of your abdomen.
do what you gotta do. Me and the guys are|running with the bulls in Pamplona next year.
gotta be up on my feet.
tell those doctors they need to fix you|up so you can run with the bulls next year.
you're an active guy.
once a year anyhow.
better than nothing.
once a year, we live like men.|- You almost died like men.
on my count.
one, two... Three.
big ass car bomb waxed half their unit.
they tried to evac, but it turned|into an insurgent firefight.
get me some wet bandages|and an occlusive dressing.
all out of those!
okay, uh, some wet towels and, uh... That.
we'll close him with this.
gekko, give me that roll of 2-inch tape.
I need a laryngoscope, an E.T. tube. I need to intubate.
okay, finish this.
Yes, sir. I'm on it.
pupils fixed and dilated.
he's way past go. Who's next?
over here, sir.
Colonel Mooney, sir. Sandstorm's coming.
command's ordered us to move back.
you're kidding me. When?
now, sir.
all right. People, secure your patients.
I almost have my guy stabilized.
you'll ride with him on the medevac.
take my amputation and|the head trauma, too.
hunt, we'll take your G.S.W. in|the A.P.C. Let's move.
you want me to go?|- No, I'm fine.
you hate helicopters.|- I know.
I'm fine.
I'll see you back there.
see you back there.
shall we scan him first?
see what kind of damage we're|dealing with in case we need an O.R?
he's got some abdominal bruising.
Yeah, yeah, okay. You--you|take this.
uh, get him up to C.T.
right away, doctor.|- Hey, how come you didn't get hurt in the avalanche?
Oh, I never got off the helicopter.
I was about to jump when|the avalanche started.
you missed it, Tommy. It|was friggin' awesome.
Yeah, Tommy, friggin' awesome!
Yeah, Tommy.
friggin' awesome.
uh, Dr. Altman said you requested|to lower your pain meds.
they make me fuzzy.
I don't want to be fuzzy today.
did she tell you?
that you're going home? Yeah.
Oh, I changed my mind.
what?|- No, no, not about...
I just... I want to do it here...
in the hospital.
I don't want Sean to have to|deal with my body afterwards.
don't worry about that stuff.
we can make this place|like home, you know?
get rid of all these machines|and... Get some of our stuff
my quilt, some pictures... Mm-hmm.
some wine.
can we have wine?
I don't see why not.
if you need wine...|- I don't.
then maybe you don't really|want-- i don't need wine.
I want the wine.
but I think you're gonna need it.
you seem scared.
are you scared?
stop worrying about me.
all these things are happening, and I'm making all|these choices, and I have no idea how you're feeling.
I'm not feeling anything.
Sean, I'm talking about|where I'm gonna die.
you have to be feeling something.
I'll go home and get|the stuff, all right?
red or white?
red.
in a wine glass, not a plastic cup.
okay.
it never changes.
you have the same fights.
I mean, even when you're|dying, you have the same fights.
you want to know how they're|feeling, and they don't want to tell you.
sorry.|I'm-- don't be.
I think they don't know.
you know, when you ask them how they're feeling, and they|don't want to tell you, and you think they're being difficult?
I think they really don't know.
relax.
deep breaths. Deep breaths. Good.
where do you stand on|physicians'-assisted suicide?
well, I'm not opposed to it.|- Good.
and as long as we're talking about the|controversial stuff, let's get something straight
arena football is not real football.
obviously--|Mark, Mark, wait.
this is not me getting to know you.
this is... I have a|patient who's terminal.
she wants to die and she|wants my help, and I want yours.
see that?
the tumor's pressing down on the floor of the|fourth ventricle, which is causing the nausea.
so you debulk the tumor, and|then you move on to the stalk
no. You debulk the tumor.
Dr. Shepherd has requested these scans.
his schedule has freed up. He's|decided to do the resection himself.
Oh, no! That's|my-- I am debulking.
it's my tumor.|- It's Dr. Shepherd's tumor now.
Dr. Hunt, can I help you?
uh, no. No, no, I got it.
Oscar-4-kilo, this is echo-5-gulf.|Oscar-4-kilo, this is echo-5-gulf.
anything, sergeant?
no, sir. I think it's the storm.
Yeah, well, they know we're coming, right?
all right. Where are we going?
green zone, baby.
they'll stabilize you, then you|are going to a hospital in Germany.
and then you're gonna go home. Okay?
Teddy get there yet?
no word.
don't worry. I'm sure|your girl's just fine.
stop it. I am serious. We're friends.
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
Hunt?! You all right, Hunt?!|- I'm okay.
you okay?|- Yeah.
we must have hit an I.E.D.
how are the patients?
I don't know.
I gotta find 'em all.
everyone's gone. We lost Gekko.
what?|- You paged.
when you did Kim Allan's|evaluation, did you scope her?
what? Wait. Is that her chart?
Dr. Altman's patient, who, according to this chart, you|ordered pulmonary function tests one week ago.
I'd like to know if, during that|evaluation, you did a bronchoscopy.
is there a problem?|- Can you just answer the question?
why are you interrogating me?
P.F.T.S can give you false positives, and a|patient may kill herself due to incorrect data.
well, it's routine, so we probably did--|probably? Probably is good enough for you?
probably is good enough for Dr. Altman?
what is going on?
are... Owen.
did you call Lani?
um, you should call your wife.
she'll freak. Tommy, call when I go in.
downplay it. It's a broken leg.
a little frostbite on your|fingers, but nothing terrible.
you're about to... Aah!
um, scream really loud.
that was worse than when I|broke my ankle on Kilimanjaro.
you guys climbed Kilimanjaro?
couple of years ago.
I made it to the summit while these guys got|altitude sickness half a mile from the top.
man. You guys are hard-core.
we gotta be.
I sell insurance.
Phil and Tommy are accountants.
these trips are all we got|to keep our blood moving.
Hey, show 'em the picture of you on|top of Kili with the rubber chicken.
that doesn't look|like you on a mountain.
Oh, sorry.
that's my daughter Hannah.
ladybug for Halloween.
you telling me you|don't want one of those?
you stole my surgery|right out from under me.
it wasn't your surgery.
it was Nelson's surgery.|- It's beyond Nelson's skill level.
right? I mean, that's what you said--|my diagnosis, my tumor, my debulking.
can I scrub in at least?
you're on Nelson's service.
if I switch you, it's|gonna look like favoritism.
Dr. Nelson's been given an|aneurysm-- you stop talking.
Meredith, calm down. People|are starting to stare.
you stole my surgery.
he stole my surgery.
everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine. Everything's, uh... Fine.
have you had lunch yet|today? I'm headed down.
Oh, I can't eat in the cafeteria anymore.
the vultures won't leave me alone.
vultures?|- People need things from me.
seems like everybody has a|pressing problem that can't wait.
shepherd, you have a minute?
see?
my lunch is making me sad, and I|haven't even started eating it yet.
say something.
shut up.|- I was gonna go for lasagna.
I don't know why I didn't pull the trigger.|- Say it.
shut up.|- Say what?
nothing.
hello.
okay, then.
if you don't say it, - you're gonna regret it|for a long, long-- enough.
okay, what is it with you two?
what is your problem?
Teddy, I-- you go to Shepherd behind my|back about a patient you don't even know?
you have no idea what she's been dealing|with, the kind of pain that she's in
pain that's only gonna be worse after I ram a tube|down her throat because you're having some kind of problem with her exercising|her legal right to die.
so I want to know, what|the hell is your problem?
you missed it. Altman tore Hunt a new one in|the cafeteria. Whole hospital's talking about it.
Oh, not to me.
I walk in the room, and all|conversation grinds to a halt.
well, come on. You don't talk locker|room talk in front of the coach.
I'm not a coach anymore.
I'm a player.
I take a shower like everybody else.
Richard... You're a little|bit like everybody else.
but mostly, you're still a coach.
it's a sign of respect.
it would be wrong to|take it any other way.
you know the drill-- we've|put you in a twilight state, next we're gonna spray lidocaine on the|back of your throat and pass the scope
I don't get it. She had|this test last week.
is--is there a chance|the results are wrong?
it's very unlikely.
but it's possible?
you wouldn't put her through|this again for no reason.
you must think that there's|a chance the tests were wrong.
there are questions being raised|that have nothing to do with
by who? Raised by who?
Sean-- just|talk to me, 'cause I'm standing here thinking|that my wife's gonna die today, and if that's not gonna happen, all right, if|there's a chance that she might get better
your wife isn't gonna get better.
this test is unnecessary, and|the hospital's covering its ass.
thank you.
no problem.
Julie... Can you find out|if Dr. Bailey's on her way?
okay, doctor.
if I wasn't happily married, I'd hit her.
I'd hit her hard.
sir, I think what you|wanted to say was "hit that.
I don't think you|wanted to say that at all.
I hear Shepherd took your surgery.
how'd you hear that?
apparently you yell really loud.
Yeah, well, I have to hold a retractor for|shadow Shepherd while Derek debulks my tumor.
so, yes, I yell very loud.
Yeah, well, the key is to think of yourself|as one of the whos down in whoville.
what?
you know, when, um, the Grinch came|down and stole all their presents...
they didn't let that|ruin Christmas for them.
you know, instead, they came out on| Christmas morning and they sang.
you're gonna go into that|surgery, and you're gonna sing.
sing, Cindy Lou. Sing.
your scalp lac is small enough|that shooting in lidocaine would be more painful than just|throwing in a couple of staples.
is this gonna hurt like my fingers?
because-- -|not too much.
sorry, sorry.
okay, that's it. I got it.
the hand was swelling so much, it|would've popped the finger right off.
what?|- You're still trying to save the arm.
you gotta tourniquet it.
if I do, then you will lose it.
it's not about the arm.
if I could just try to tie|off that brachial artery
Owen! It's not about the arm.
you're right. I know.|I know. You're right.
okay, Dan, listen to me.
the back of this truck is trashed.
most of the supplies, all the morphine--|there's no morphine. There's no lidocaine.
you bring whiskey?
okay, we got it. We got it We|got it. We got it. We got it.
no. I don't think we do.
Dr. Hunt. Dr. Hunt.
kim Allan's bronchoscopy confirmed|that nothing more could be done.
Sloan signed off.
he did his due diligence, but it's over.
you're not gonna kill him.
I won't let you kill him.
you're not gonna kill him.
Dr. Hunt... The patient|in question is a woman.
no one's trying to kill her.
she's choosing to die.
you should go home.
I have a surgery.|- You're done for the day. Go home.
okay, okay. Can you--|can you hold this?
I c-- - can you|put pressure there?
I don't|think
okay, I'm gonna|have to move you
Oh, no, I can't. I can't. I'm too tired.
no, no, no. Dan, Dan, wake up. Wake up. I have to.
it's gonna hurt like hell, but|I have to find something to pack this wound till someone comes.
someone's coming? Someone's coming?
okay, you ready? Here we go. Here we go.
okay, here we go. Here we go.
Oh, please, please! Please!|Please. Please. Please.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|- Please just... Don't.
I'm sorry.
there we go. There we go.
hypothermia
uh, that's the last one. The last...
stop that.
someone is coming. Help is coming.
you been saying that for hours.
I'm coagulopathic.
I'm probably acidotic.
I'm in the triad of death.
no one is coming.
if I could just move you--|- No! Look, Hunt, I need you
I need you to say a Hail Mary with me.
I don't know it.|- That's okay.
it's okay. Just say it with me.
hail Mary...|- Hail Mary...
full of grace...|- Full of grace...
the Lord is with thee.|- The Lord is with thee.
blessed art thou amongst women...|- Blessed art thou amongst women...
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.|- Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
holy Mary, mother of god...|- Holy Mary, mother of god...
pray for us sinners...|- Pray for us sinners...
now...|- Now...
and at the hour of our death.|- And at the hour of our death.
Amen.|- Amen.
you make sure Lisa|gets my ring, all right?
don't give|up, Dan. Don't
don't use it to propose|to Altman or something.
but you-- you should|propose to Altman.
you know, you two, you|should-- you should...
shut up, Dan. I'm engaged to Beth.
and you, you are gonna give|that ring to Lisa, okay?
come on. Come on. What? No.
move your hand.|- No.
that's an order, soldier.
no, sir.
they're working on Nick's kidney.
uh, I was able to stabilize his legs, but it's gonna be a|long recovery process.
you may need to let his wife know it's a little bit|more than a broken leg.
Yeah, I told my wife, and|she's calling Lani.
my wife can handle her better.
so you-- you summited Kili, you|run with the bulls, but you're
you're scared of your friend's wife.
I was scared on Kili.
I hated every minute of it.
so why do it?|- Nick and Phil. They're my boys.
and they love adventure.
me? I got a kid... And bad knees.
but I can't ruin it.|We're a team, you know?
so you just suck it up, huh?
close my eyes and hope I don't die.
I can't actually give you the drugs, but you can have this prescription|filled in the hospital pharmacy.
again, I want to emphasize, there|are other options.
we can make you comfortable.
I just have one|question. - Owen, no
what if they find a cure?
I know that it's a long shot, but isn't saving your life|worth gambling on a long shot?
Dr. Hunt, I will call|security if you do not step
let-- Let|her answer.
I'd like to hear the answer.
maybe...
you have to be dying to understand.
but there's this thing that happens...
where death stops being scary.
what starts being scary is hope...
cause it's not true.
even if they found a cure|for cancer tomorrow...
it's too late for me.
and hanging on to hope, it|may make you feel better...
but it just makes me feel alone.
I don't want to die alone.
okay?
I am not afraid of this.
why are you?
why are you so afraid to let me die?
Dr. Hunt.
the pharmacy wouldn't|take my insurance card.
there was some problem.
so I had to go to a cash machine.
and, uh, I'm|running around
I'm trying to get enough cash to buy the pills that|are gonna kill my wife.
anyway...
here they are.
there'll be a moment...
when she dies, her face will relax and...
all that pain that she|was in, it'll be gone.
and you will feel relief...
relief for her, relief for you.
and you will know with|absolute certainty...
that you did the right thing.
just for a moment...
you gotta let me go, Hunt.
okay? You gotta let me go.
please. It hurts. It hurts. Oh, please.
it's okay. It's okay.|It's okay. Look at me.
okay, you gotta do it.
you gotta do it. I can't make you do it.
okay? Oh, jeez, it hurts|It hurts. It hurts.
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
okay?
you have to hold on to that moment, because all the rest of it...
is just your own garbage.
you'll be in physical|therapy for six months, but with luck, uh, you'll be|ready for your trip next year.
pamplona, baby!|- Pamplona!
pamplona.
Oh, come on. He hates this stuff.
all right, the|adrenaline, the adventure
he-- he does this|just for you guys, because you guys love|it, and he loves you.
and... That's my rant for the day.
I'm sorry. I like to see people|keep their legs. Ignore me.
you know, I'm starting my own business.
that keeps my blood pumping.
I'm with Tommy.
sorry, Nick.
I can't believe you guys.
I almost died jumping out|of a damn helicopter...
when I really wanted to|go wine tasting in Napa.
Napa.
Napa!
it...
place looks different.
something's different.
something I can help you with?
you were jealous of her today.
I'm sorry?|- Meredith. That's why you stole her surgery.
you miss the pace of back-to-back|surgeries, the adrenaline.
Yeah, I do.
schedule yourself|one surgery a day
in the morning, early, an|hour before anyone else
so at the very least|you start your day good.
you start your day cutting.
and you don't have to actually|sign all the paperwork.
Patricia's an excellent forger.
and if you eat alone in the|cafeteria, you are a sitting duck.
so you need to eat with someone else.
that way people are more|likely to leave you alone.
you can eat with me.
thank you.
living is better than dying...
until it's not.
I'm scared.
come here.
but even if letting a person|die is the right thing to do...
it's not what surgeons are built for.
we are arrogant and competitive.
I'm sorry.
I know you're mad at me.
I'm not mad.
I'm in Whoville.
Whoville?|- Whoville.
we don't like to lose...
this is really hard for me to say, 'cause I really|care about you, and
Oh, my god. You're breaking up with me.
are you sleeping with|Mark again? 'Cause are
are you one of those fake lesbians, just having a va-vacation|in lesbian land and
stop.
God, it's not bad.
this thing I have to tell you isn't bad.
I just... I want to have a baby at some point in my life.
that's all.
I really... I have to have a baby.
and death...
feels like a loss...
even when we know it's not.
we know it's time. We know it's right.
hey there. Come in.
I helped my patient die today.
you want to talk about it?
no.
we know we did everything we could.
it's okay. Okay?
you gotta do it. You gotta|do it. I can't make you do it.
you-- you|gotta do it.
okay?
I... I couldn't sleep.
are you okay?
but it's hard to shake|the feeling that...
we could've done more.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Go back to bed.
Owen... Wh-what are you thinking?
nothing. Nothing.
go back to bed.
psychologists believe that every aspect of our lives, all thoughts and behavior patterns are the direct result of our relationship to our parents.
well, you're looking all thoughtful.
I was just thinking how pretty you are...
and also how pretty our children would be.
children?
like, multiple?
child.
let's just start with one and see how that goes.
you wanna start?
I'm just saying you are pretty.
that's all I'm saying.
that every relationship we have
have you talked to Dr. Wyatt?
when's the last time you...
it's just us trying over and over again to get it right.
Alex. - Mer?
okay, so Izzie's not here, and Cristina's not answering her phone, and I have a thing.
so I need you to be a girl for me.
What'd he do?
you want me to kick his ass?
he wants me to have a baby.
so you do want me to kick his ass.
do you want to have a baby?
a baby doesn't want me.
I had the worst mother in the world.
I would be the worst mother in the world.
Izzie wants a divorce.
she sent the papers the official papers.
want me to kick her ass?
hey - He's being a girl for me.
dude, it's true.
right.
well, there's a guy downstairs says he's your brother.
you want me to send him up here to the bathroom since this seems to be where you receive your visitors?
uh, tell him to wait.
right.
you have a brother? - Yeah.
do you want me to go get rid of him? - Crap.
what's he doing here?
Alex is the oldest, then me and then Amber.
Amber's graduating from St. Savior's in May.
she's smart, like Alex.
and I don't know what to tell her.
Alex is the doctor in the family.
I just move people for a living.
what are you doing here?
man. You got old.
uh, what are you doing here?
I had to drive to Portland on a job, and since I was in the neighborhood...
well, Portland's not in the neighborhood.
three hours I do three hours in my sleep.
he's allowed to come say hi.
you're gonna be late for pre-rounds.
well, it--it was very nice to meet you.
I'm Lexie, by the way.
I'm overdue for a visit. It's been seven years.
no, it has not.
since you've been home.
seven years.
you haven't been home in seven years?
I have this.
Hey, I'm Derek. Nice meeting you.
Aaron. - Take care.
I'll see you. - Meredith, by the way.
hello. - Nice to meet you.
has it been seven years?
amber was 10 the last time we saw you.
aaron, what's going on? What do you want?
I do miss you, okay? And I-I did want to say hi, but since you're a doctor, I thought I'd ask...
should I be worried about this?
thank you. - Cappuccino.
cappuccino. - How'd the date go with Teddy?
I don't know if I'd call it a date.
doesn't going on a date imply actually going somewhere?
Oh, shut up.
you had sex?
Hey, guys. - Hey.
pound cake.
I love pound cake...
thank you. - Rich, buttery pound cake.
yum. Pound cake.
pound cake? - Oh, I'm good. Thanks
so what exactly constitutes a pound cake?
it's a yellow cake... - There you go.
kinda heavy. - Come on.
code for something dirty, right?
like "You eat her pound cake. She eats your pound cake"?
no.
Oh, please, tell me it's dirty, because otherwise, that was the most boring conversation I've ever been a part of.
we are talking about pound cake because I want a kid, and she doesn't, and we're not talking about that.
how long are you two not gonna have that conversation a year, two years, five?
you're changing the subject.
you like how I did that?
so how was it?
mind-blowing. - Yeah?
I pounded her cake. - She pounded mine.
good. - Excellent pound caking.
"pound caking" is not a thing.
whatever. I blew her mind.
life-changing? Life-changing, earth-shattering. The point is, he's a legend for a reason.
I mean, he has skills that I never even knew existed.
it was like there was a-a party going on.
a party in your panties.
morning. - Good morning.
okay, bye. Bye. - See ya.
he's always so grumpy.
he's going through something, and Cristina doesn't get it.
she can't, which isn't her fault,
but I do get it. And I can't be there for him,
that's really hard.
but you're seeing Mark.
but I'm seeing Mark.
so then a couple days ago, we're at the grocery store, Gary and I, and the next thing I know, I'm flat on my back in the frozen foods section.
she fainted.
and I've never fainted.
I never seen anybody faint. I don't believe in fainting.
did you hit your head?
I would've if this one hadn't caught me.
Clark is anemic and guaiac positive, so there's definitely some internal bleeding, which looks like it's coming from a friable tumor near the ampulla of vater.
Yes, thank you for that, Dr. Kepner.
Swender told us the biopsy showed the cancer was back.
but she said you might be able to take it there's a chance I won't be able to go in as deeply as I'll need to, but I promise to do everything I can.
anything you could do.
we appreciate it, Dr. Webber.
thank you.
thank you.
I honestly don't think I need surgery.
you do.
it doesn't even hurt that bad.
I think surgery's just gonna make it hurt worse.
you remember when dad had his gall bladder out?
stop talking and write - Write what
I don't have insurance.
what am I suppose to write - ask Bailey to do it pro bono. - I can't ask her to do that.
Alex, he's your brother.
evil Spawn has a brother?
aaron, Cristina Yang.
nice to meet you Dr Yang. I'm Aaron Karev.
Oh my god. He's so nice - Be nice.
why can't you be nice like your brother - Angel Spawn?
why can't you? - Fair enough.
uh, Mer, what's up? You called? - Ten times.
Owen's still in his dark place, and he's still not talking, so I turned off my cell in case he would say something, which he didn't.
I hate men. They're stupid.
Derek asked me to have a baby with him this morning.
really stupid.
what have we got? - Cop with multiple G.S.W.s.
how many cops did you say? - Just one.
officer Gina Thompson, 34, G.S.W.s to the hip and chest.
Vitals--100 over 70, pulse 118, respiration's 28.
that's quite a police escort there, Officer Thompson.
I told those guys I was gonna be fine.
I wonder why they didn't believe you.
I been in worse shape.
Seriously? - Oh, yeah.
you should see the other guys.
you took down three guys by yourself?
Hey, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
am I right, ladies?
let's go.
how many bullet wounds? - Four - Breath sounds are - All right, three chestwounds can't be transthoracic. Oh, god, Gina, baby.
baby, look at you.
I'm OK baby. They're taking really good care of me.
this is my husband Jamie.
that's Lieutenant Moore.
so what'd you find out at the scene?
you were told to wait for backup.
well, I was first on the scene. I heard a shot. I went in.
you disobeyed a direct order.
you endangered your own life and everybody
I took down three men by myself.
and you got yourself suspended for it.
what it's going to the review board this afternoon.
you'll be lucky to have a jobby the end of the day.
I gotta go defend myself. - I need you to take a deep breath.
she's bleeding into her chest. - All right, thorw in the chest tube now!
get them outta here now!
no, I gotta go. Please!
all right, Gina, just lie back.
all you have to do is breathe.
Dr. Webber, did you consider doing a whipple on Mrs. Clark?
I did, but since the cancer came back,
I think I can do a local resection and get the entire visible tumor.
Dr. Kepner, are we boring you? - No. Sir
I just--I wasn't expecting Chief Shepherd to be up in the gallery during a general surgery.
but I guess that's the chief's job, right-- evaluating, observing?
Dr. Kepner you're in my O.R..
and the only one observing and evaluating you right now is me.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
with the orange or the red?
how's that? Orange and the red. You think it's gonna work?
Dr. Bailey, you got a second? - I do. I have a second.
which is why I'm spending it with my child.
here, look. Say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev." See him? Bye-Bye.
Dr. Bailey...
my little brother is here, with what looks like a, uh, umbilical hernia.
I didn't know Dr. Karev had a little brother.
did you know Dr. Karev had a little brother?
he has no money. He doesn't have insurance, so
Ah, mommy sees where this is going.
he--he'd have to have you perform the surgery pro bono.
did you hear that funny word?
pro bono?
mommy's got a mountain of surgeries to schedule.
does she have time to do free surgeries?
and I'll schedule your surgeries...
for the next...week if you want.
you think mommy should fix up Dr. Karev's brother...
and make him feel all better?
two weeks.
a month.
well, all right.
Karev's brother in, what, half an hour.
say "Bye-bye, Dr. Karev." Bye-bye.
I woulda done it anyway, but he just kept talking, didn't?
you're so good.
Mr. Clark.
how is she?
she did great in there.
the surgery went great.
we got the tumor all of it with good margins.
Oh, thank god.
Dr. Grey, thank you. Thank you so much.
my wife keeps telling me...
I need to be more manly about all this.
I mean, after all, she's the one with the cancer.
she's afraid I'm the one who won't make it.
I think you're doing just fine.
you both are. Would you like to see her?
can I? - She should be waking up any minute.
how is it your brother is a surgeon and you waited months to take care of this?
I don't know.
Karevs are tough.
I guess five years in foster care will do that to you.
foster care?
you're all foster children?
well, me and Amber were in and out, but Alex, he had like...
17 Different foster homes in 5 years.
so Alex was a foster child?
Yeah, because my mom was, you know, and it was before they had all the meds that they have today, and she was--I guess he was doing her best. But my dad, he wasn't a good guy,
you know...
whatever. And so alex, he got shipped around a lot.
and...
he was a pretty rough kid if you didn't know him, so people didn't like to keep him.
then he ended up in juvie.
J-j-juvenile detention?
yeah,'cause my mom, she-- .
buy food, so...
he was good, though.
people wouldn't have even known he was stealing anything if it hadn't been for the video cameras.
how old was he?
mm, 11, maybe 12.
Hey, what are we doing with 28-07?
dude, are you talking crap in here? - No.
dude, I work here. - Uh, check the chest tube in 28-07.
go. - Shut it, Aaron.
so what happened after juvie?
Bailey, I don't think that Alex - Mind your business.
aaron, after juvie?
you couldn't expect me to just sit there with a 10-71 in progress.
I had good, solid information the perps were threatening a 2-1-7.
uh, we need to take you to surgery.
Kenny, did you get that? It was a 10-71.
baby, he got that okay? But you gotta go with them.
wait! Look, this is important, okay?
they're gonna need a statement.
baby, that's what's important, trying to save your job - Jimmy listen, every year, you promise me that once you make detective,
buy a house, have a kid and settle down.
but...
baby, it's been seven years.
and every time you get close to a promotion, you go do something stupid.
baby, and now these people are trying to save your life, and you want 'em to wait.
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you die.
I want a life with you, baby.
happy, boring life.
tell me everything you did.
I was trying to wean her off the ventilator, but then I realized that she wasn't breathing on her own.
so I put her back on her previous vent settings.
Wh--Dr. Webber, what's happening to her?
she may have stroked out.
and get the scans to Shepherd and also run an E.E.G..
we need to find out right away if there's any brain activity.
if there's not, then we need
she--she looks great. Oh, thank god.
Dr. Grey told me you got the tumor.
thank you so much, Dr. Webber.
can I wake her?
sweetheart?
you still sleeping?
the doctors said you did great in there.
honey?
you awake?
Oh, the patient's had a massive hemorrhage.
look, you see here?
the left temporal lobe?
the hemorrhage, it's it looks like it wow. That bleed is huge.
what? - You look even prettier in your scrubs.
what are you gonna do about your giant stroke?
nothing.
nothing?
Clark has a left temporal lobe hemorrhage that's extended into the ventricular system.
want to get a cup of coffee? - Only if you keep telling me how pretty I am?
I've got three bowel injuries here. - You got anything, Avery?
I found what did the damage.
what you see the bullet? - lodged near the liver.
Teddy, I'm looking at a devastator.
what? What does that mean?
it means be careful they're sharp like shrapnel and they explode on impact.
can You imagine going to work every day knowing you're gonna end up on the wrong side of a gun?
I know. She is awesome.
and now her husband wants her to give it all up?
he's all like,"let's start popping out babies why does it have to be one or the other?"
because you don't have kids if you're facing mortar fire every day.
it screws with your head. - Is that why you don't have 'em--Iraq?
well, first it was residency, and then it was Iraq, and now it's, I don't know, waiting for the right guy?
you want to have kids?
wait. You don't?
have you met me? No.
okay, we're done here.
I think I feel it. - Feel what?
the bullet. It's right next to the heart.
there's still some bleeding. Don't worry. I got it.
no, no, no, don't! Don't touch it!
Oh, god! Damn it, Cristina. - What--what happened? What just happened?
you essentially fired a bullet into that patient's chest is what you did.
that's my intestine?
Yeah, and that part right there is supposed to be on the inside of the membrane, not the outside.
dude, that is sick.
can I get a copy of one of these? I want to hang it from my fridge.
uh, hey, are we doing consults at the desk nowadays?
cause I kinda need to use the computer.
Oh, this is Alex's brother.
aaron, this is Arizona Robbins.
Oh, nice to meet you.
how come I didn't meet you at the wedding?
Robbins-- oh, that's right, that's right.
no one's family came. Last-minute switcheroo and all that.
Alex got married?
I'm just gonna go use the computer over there.
Bye.
he got married and he didn't even call us?
no, it--it--it sounds weird,
but it was totally a spur-of-the-moment thing, - You know, because of the cancer. - Alex has cancer?
Lexie-- no, Izzie has cancer.
who's Izzie? - Alex's wife.
But...She's not really his wife anymore.
It's--you know, I-I really, I wouldn't worry about it.
they got divorced?
no, but they a-- well, s-she left.
and then, you know, she came back.
but he didn't really think it was the right thing-- okay.
Lexie. Stop talking.
you guys all right up there?
there is shrapnel everywhere.
I was going for the bleeder.
I was going I didn't even touch the bullet.
when your commanding officer tells you to stand down, you stand down.
give me that.
I'm not in the army and you're not my commanding officer.
Dr. Altman and I are your attending.
and you are our subordinate.
you do exactly as we say even if you do not agree.
because we know more than you do.
for example, we know that devastator bullets have chemicals in them, and sometimes they do not detonate on impact.
sometimes the heat from that bovie is enough to make them explode.
do you understand?
Dr. yang, do you understand?
hunt, I would've done the same thing Yang did.
anybody would.
let's just fix it.
yang, I need your hands right now, right here.
okay, you see this? - Hold it.
dude, how could you not have told me you got married?
you told him? - It wasn't me.
w-well, some of it was, but- it was Arizona Robbins, and it was an accident.
Yeah, she figured your own brother would already know that you married somebody, but, hey-- see, this is why I didn't want to tell you, because I knew you'd make a big deal out
it is a big deal. You get married on the spur of the moment, - you walk out on your wife - I did not walk out on my wife.
she walked out on me.
you have any idea what mom's gonna do when she finds out?
she's gonna go off her meds.
she's not gonna do anything because you're not gonna tell her, all right?
you're gonna get your free surgery, you're gonna get back in your truck, and you're gonna get the hell outta here.
fine, you know what? I don't need your free surgery.
I'll see ya.
aaron, stop. - You're not going anywhere.
I don't need your crap!
you walk out on us, you walk out on your wife?
like father, like son.
take that back.
Alex - Get off me, man!
what are you two fools- oh, no, this is not hap--Alex!
Karev! What the hell is your problem, man?!
you are! - Hey, hey, hey! - You hitting people now, too? You really did turn into dad.
walk away. Alex, walk away. Just walk away.
um, give him some space okay? Don't follow him. - Okay.
Hey, un, I need a gurney.
run, honey. - Right away.
she could wake up, right?
I mean, people wake up from comas all the time.
I'm sorry.
your wife's coma is irreversible.
Dr. Drey, would you explain it, please?
Clark's scans showed a massive hemorrhage in her brain.
and the E.E.G. showed minimal brain activity.
but that means there's hope, right?
at least there's activity.
and--and her heart is still beating.
only because the mechanical ventilator is breathing for her.
when we turn the machine off, the heart won't get the oxygen it needs, and it will stop.
why would you turn it off?
people can live for years on these machines.
Clark, the advanced directive your wife signed specifically requested no mechanical ventilation.
she filled that form out three years ago when the cancer was first diagnosed.
the doctor told her she had six months to live.
and she held on for another three years.
she'll come back from this, too. You'll see.
you can't unplug her.
legally, we don't have a choice, sir.
she's my wife.
it's my choice.
it's your wife's choice...
and she made it three years ago.
you said the surgery went fine. - That's what you said. It did. But
but - No, no, you're not a doctor.
you're a child!
and you're useless!
I'm done talking with you.
I'm done talking with all of you.
who's in charge here?
he protected me my whole life, you know?
kicked my dad's ass so hard, the son of a bitch never came back.
I always thought he did that for me.
but maybe he just likes throwing punches.
aaron, I like you.
I do, but you can't talk about my friend that way. Okay?
I need you to count backwards from ten for me, okay?
okay.
that's it.
a junkie dad, a crackpot mom, and somehow Karev still became a doctor.
I'm not easily impressed, but I'm impressed.
uh, prep him. We'll go scrub.
Yes, doctor.
Dr. Grey.
we're meeting Gary Clark in Shepherd's office.
five minutes.
I told a patient's husband that...
she was fine, that her surgery went perfectly.
and the next thing we know, she has a stroke, and we are supposed to just unplug her.
and I know--I know that I am supposed to toughen up.
I know that I am supposed to not care, h-how do you not care?
it's the hardest part of the job...
the very hardest part.
how did you do it?
how did you learn?
I'm still learning.
why is her B.P. still low?
is she still bleeding up there?
no, I got it under control.
we've had L.R..
and blood hanging since we got here, is her liver still bleeding?
no, I think we got it.
no, Dr. Hunt, Dr. Torres is right.
there's still bleeding in the retroperitoneum.
we need a retractor in here.
that's a lot of blood. Avery, get in there, suction.
I can't see past the clots. Avery?
the suction's clogging now.
let's use our hands and scoop.
come on. Let's get in there. - Did you check the uterine artery?
down to 64 over 32.
we gotta stop this thing or we're gonna lose if we hadn't been distracted by artillery, Hunt, not now.
at that was, um...
we were speaking in shorthand.
we forget sometimes that you guys are civilians and that you don't know about ballistics.
no, it's not just that. It was...
it's not the first time.
he has been through so much.
it's not like he talks about it.
he can't.
I mean, I can't talk about it either most days.
Owen had it worse than me.
he has it worse.
he's triggered. Right now, he's triggered, and his triggers might never go away.
I mean, they'll get better over time, if you give him time, which you should, because he is in love with you.
he just needs time.
he needs therapy.
I-I keep telling him to go to Dr. Wyatt
no, don't--don't--don't do that.
he won't go if you tell him to.
he's very...
he's a guy that way, a man.
don't ever tell him what to do.
just tell him how you feel.
when's the best time to have kids?
is never.
well, you asked.
well, yeah, but-- they cry all the time, nonstop.
they never sleep.
they're terrible conversationalists.
and they take everything you've got all your time, all your focus, all your patience, all your sleep everything till you got nothing left for you.
but this morning...
his cold, little nose.
and he goes "wake up."
and he got the "K" sound in "Wake."
see, up until today, he'd say "d" instead " "wade up."
girl, him nailing that "k" sound...
it's the pride I felt, the irrational unbridled, joy...
well, it's at least as good as any whipple.
look, if you're waiting for the perfect time to have kids, you're never going to have kids.
aaron's surgery went well.
his hernia defect was fairly large, but Bailey was able to use mesh to bridge it.
he'll be waking up in a few minutes if you want to stop by.
Clark, I'm deeply sorry for your for your loss.
no, don't--don't speak about my wife as if she's dead.
she's still here. She could wake up.
she's not gonna wake up, Mr. Clark.
Clark, not with the brain damage she suffered.
you don't know that.
Clark, if we don't obey your wife's directive, if we ignore her wishes
she signed that form three years ago - Her health will deteriorate.
she'll lose body mass. She'll have no immune system.
she'll require around-the-clock care, and that can become very expensive very quickly.
I don't care about that.
it'll be no life for either of you.
and that's why your wife signed the advanced directive.
she didn't want to have to live her life this way.
and she didn't want you to live your life this way either.
don't you speak for my wife.
don't you dare speak for my wife.
Clark, but the ethics committee has reviewed your case.
we are bound by law to obey her wishes.
if you unplug my wife...
you'll be killing her.
I'm sorry.
to say good-bye.
there's no one to call.
we didn't have any family.
it was just us.
we didn't have any kids.
it's just me.
he's my sister's husband.
excuse me?
don't play stupid.
I'm not playing stupid.
I am stupid.
I'm stupid and I'm humiliated .
I'm sorry.
I've never felt anything...
I've never felt like this before.
so i-if you could just please forget what you saw, because I promise, you will never see it again, and--and we--we can just go back to being doctors.
please.
this day sucks. I hate this day.
Oh, god.
you don't have to be here. You can go.
I'm just making sure you don't croak, and then I'm outta here.
saved my ass every day when were kids.
you were a better parent than mom and dad put together.
and every day, I feel bad for Amber that she has just me instead of you.
what happened to you, man?
I send you money every month.
I send mom her meds.
you want that to stop?
I am this close to being a real surgeon.
I-I can't be in that and do this.
I can't.
Amber's a good kid.
she turned out okay. You'd like her.
you turned out okay, too, Aaron.
I'm sorry your wife left you...
or got cancer or whatever.
Thanks.
we repaired the damage to your liver and intestine, cleaned out your fractured hip and fixed your lung.
there was a bullet, and some shrapnel near your heart.
Oh, my god. - But Dr. Altman was able to repair all the damage.
thank you. Thank you all so much.
honestly, I-I don't even know what to say.
There--there was, uh, there were complications, Gina.
there was a lot of bleeding in the abdomen.
the uterine artery was involved.
we were able to stop the bleed, but...
in order to do that, we had to...
remove your uterus.
what?
we had to perform a hysterectomy.
I'm sorry.
we can't have kids?
I'm so sorry.
we can never have kids?
Oh, god. - Baby, it's okay.
it's all right, Baby.
it's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay.
how long has he been there?
about three hours.
it's time.
see it through.
Mr. Clark.
no, please.
I'm sorry.
I keep telling myself.
once you turn off the respirator.
there is a chance even if it's just less than a 1% chance that she'll start breathing again, right?
miracles do happen.
that's what--that's what she always says.
please.
please, darling, wake up.
P-please.
I am so sorry.
please. Please.
please, please wake up.
please wake up.
pl-- please wake up.
please wake up.
were you checking up on me in that surgery today?
no, I wasn't checking up on you. I was observing.
you know that's the closest I get to an O.R. these days?
I'm gonna choose to believe you on that.
they were married 32 years.
there was nothing you could've done.
I'm going home to my wife. You should do the same thing.
looking good, Gina.
you're gonna be back on the beat in no time.
that's what they call it, right, the beat?
Yes, they do, and no, she won't.
Jimmy and I talked about it. I'm quitting.
what? - Why?
Well,'cause Jimmy's right.
and I love it.
but I love my husband, too.
and what, we're gonna adopt ten Haitian orphans or something?
eight.
well Congratulation - Thank you.
I want you to know, I did the best I could with the review board.
Josh, it's okay - and they want you back on the job.
are you kidding me?
welcome back, Officer Thompson.
Oh, my god. - Hey, look out now. Watch out.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
thank you so much.
Where's Aaron?
he went back to Iowa.
you let him drive after surgery?
I'm not his dad.
he's got my number.
you know you're nothing like your father, right?
you're nothing like your mother.
you're good.
so you'd be good.
you'd be a good mom.
it's the most important job in the world.
you probably should need a license to do it.
but then most of us wouldn't even pass the written exam.
you ever wonder if moisturizer really works?
I mean, what's in the stuff?
I'm a doctor, and I haven't even heard of half of it.
uh, "dimethicone."
no idea.
"Distearyldim-dimo"-- hmm.
I--yeah, I can't even pronounce that. So...
Disteary - I want to have a baby.
and I-I can't talk about lotion or pound cake or anything else, because you don't want to have a baby, and I do.
we're gonna talk about it.
Yeah.
we are gonna talk about it.
some people are naturals.
they were born to do it.
some have other gifts.
Oh, you're making dinner.
it's just pasta.
it smells good.
are you baking bread?
you said you don't want to have kids.
what?
Oh, the sausages are burning.
no, they're fine.
no, they're burning.
Cristina, listen, they're fine.
damn it!
I am sorry are you scared of me?
I don't want to be.
I have to go back to Dr. Wyatt.
it's okay.
it's okay.
biology dictates, you don't have to do it alone.
I don't want you to be alone.
if anything should happen to me...
I don't want you to be alone. Just be you.
well, we would make pretty babies.
so you're thinking about it, then?
Oh, I'm thinking about it.
you can waste your whole life wondering...
but the only way to find out what kind of parent you'd be is to finally stop talking about it...
but we're not making babies right now.
we're practicing.
it's very important to practice.
and just do it.
Oh, you taste good.
you have no idea how good you taste.
Oh, Mark, I-- ohh, I'm really, really...
enjoying myself with you.
I need to be honest about something.
if you're honestly enjoying yourself.
I-I am.
I am.
that's as honest as you have to be.
okay.
now turn over.
I want to try a little milk chocolate on your belly button.
ignore 'em. They'll go away.
I'll get rid of 'em.
Sloan. - The baby's coming right now!
Oh, the baby's coming!
Oh, the baby's coming!
we're doctors.
we're trained to care for human beings.
and we're pretty sure we know what to look for.
no, it doesn't make any sense!
I... And everybody wants a kid.
and... And you of all people. You wear roller skates for shoes. I don't get it.
you know what? I don't know.
maybe there's something wrong with me.
cause it's not natural.
it's not womanly. Maybe I'm cold and heartless and dead inside.
no, I'm not saying that! - Well, yeah. But a little bit, you are.
no. No.
cuts... infection... genetic mutation.
you know what? Just... Just humor me for one minute, okay?
close your eyes.
close your eyes.
now picture a baby.
a warm... Slushy little... Baby...
wrapping its chubby little arms around your neck and breathe in that intoxicating baby smell.
doesn't it just melt you?
Nope.
you know what melts me?
spain, the beach, you in a bikini, me holding a sangria.
Oh, wait.
what's that I hear?
Oh... Oh, the baby's crying.
we can't go to Spain. - A sangria?
that's why I don't get a kid?
so I can make you a frigging sangria?
just a minute. Just a minute!
what? Yang, you got a suture kit?
uh, yeah. Where's Robbins?
uh, in there. - Robbins!
what's going on? - Wait, two.
I need two suture kits!
why is he screaming?
baby.
now! - Why are you... Oh, god.
he's serious.
holy mother...
get my bag. Get my bag.
get me a clamp.
Oh, god.
all right. Another clamp.
clamp.
scissors.
how is he? Is he okay? Is he good?
he's great. You did great.
Oh, dad.
all right.
any sounds? - Not yet.
okay.
come on, baby boy. Come on.
come on, baby boy. Come on. Come on. Come on.
come on.
okay. That's my boy.
okay. That's what I'm talking about.
here you go, grandpa.
so is it true, you helped Teddy and Mark deliver little Sloan's baby?
Yeah. Not now.
what's wrong with you?
Tom Evans... In with your husband.
that's Tom Evans?
he seems a lot younger than I would've... - Please try and be cool.
morning.
he's in with shepherd.
who? - Tom Evans.
Tom Evans is... is here?
you didn't know?
he's doing his bloodless OPCAB on a beating heart today in our o.r.
what, shepherd didn't tell you?
no, no, he... - Bless you. Bless you.
no, he didn't. An Evans bypass.
clear your schedule. Scrub in.
uh, no, I-I, uh, I can't. I- I gotta go.
and here she is.
your cruise director...
Dr. Yang. - DR. Evans.
hello.
I-I'm... Cristina Yang.
I - I'm a huge fan.
she's a groupie, but you're gonna forgive her, because she's one of the finest cardio resident's you'll meet anywhere.
quite a recommendation. Are you scrubbing in with me today?
Yes, it's an honor and a privilege.
uh, I... Here are the patient charts and, uh, the most recent labs.
if there's anything else you need, just ask me, cause I'll be around here all day, following you.
um, if... If that's okay with you.
uh... She is a groupie. I like her.
this is my wife, DR. Meredith Grey. - Pleasure to meet you.
likewise. I hear great things. Of course, I hear them from your husband, so grain of salt.
Dr. Yang? - Yes.
all yours. - Yes of course
the patient is right this way, sir.
think she's gonna drool on him?
I think she is.
Oh, okay. I gotta go. I'll see you soon.
is that Thomas Evans from Baylor?
Yes, but don't get too excited. He's only here for one case.
Oh, are you sure?
because I overheard chief shepherd discussing the fact that DR. Altman doesn't have a permanent contract.
so it would actually be a really genius move on the chief's part to go in and seize that opportunity to...
Oh, here we go again.
what? - Shut up.
she thinks your husband walks on water.
I don't I don't.
I, um... No, I'm... I mean, it's...
it's a professional thing.
it's, um... It's a mentor thing.
he's... He's just my mentor because he's... He's married... To you.
and you guys are... Are so great and, um, together...
together as a married couple, and you... You... You are so great.
I, um, I do... I do think that your husband is brilliant, but I'm...
I'm sure that you think that, too, so... That's right.
okay. That, um... - Thank you.
you can see it, right?
the... The resemblance?
it's a newborn.
it resembles other newborns.
okay. All right. Fine. But you want incontrovertible proof?
here we go.
look at that.
well, it's impressive. I'll give you that.
well, I mean... I mean, a lot of that swelling is from the birth. It will go down.
he's a Sloan.
right. - He's a Sloan.
what is it?
trauma choppers.
nice.
Hey, could you... Could you hand me my...
Oh, well, okay. - Good morning.
good morning.
Yes, it is. I have a trauma chopper 15 minutes out and a small window of time where I can actually practice medicine.
right. Plus Thomas Evans is here.
he is. He's doing a coronary... - Is he interviewing for my job?
because I've been waiting to hear about a permanent contract from you, and I haven't.
and Thomas Evans is here... - Teddy, temporary contract.
you said you were looking elsewhere.
Yeah, I-I was, but I stopped.
I didn't know that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I should've told you.
look, I'd be happy to consider you for the permanent position.
consider me? For... For my job?
I had to run a search. I can't get caught without a head of cardio.
okay. Well, I-I... I'd like to be considered.
I'll throw you in the mix.
Hey, the baby's sleeping.
um... Thank you for... Everything.
I'm happy to help.
dad.
everything's fine. The baby's doing great.
Hey, can you grab my bag?
Oh, yeah.
what is all that?
you... Did you buy all this for the baby?
Yeah.
I figured he was gonna need stuff, and I was already in the store.
I mean, I know it's lame. All the girl's stuff was way better.
but boys like army crap, right?
Oh, no. Well, that's a choking hazard.
and, well, he's a little young for that.
and... And that.
he's just a little young.
well, whatever. It doesn't really matter anyway.
he's gonna be getting a lot nicer stuff soon.
here.
uh, this is the number for the people that are gonna adopt him... Trish and Keith.
can you call them?
mark... - Yeah.
do you want me to handle that call? - No, no.
I'll take care of it.
it was a fishing boat accident and two patients...
why would they send a chopper for a guy with a fish hook?
uh, I'm pretty sure they said fish hook, chief shepherd.
okay.
I'm pretty sure they said fish hook, chief shepherd.
but if I'm wrong, you can spank me.
shut up. - "Oh, chief shepherd, I do hope I'm wrong.
what do we got?
uh, I've got the son... Head laceration and crush injuries. The dad's right behind.
let's go. - Okay.
50-year-old male, penetrating trauma to the chest.
hypertensive in the field, gotten 2 liters of l. r. En route.
big hook!
big hook!
Mrs. Smitte, when is the last time you took a flight of stairs instead of an elevator?
Oh, god, it's... It's been years.
this time next week, you're gonna do it.
and your grandkids, you have... You have grandkids?
two.
they're not gonna know what hit them.
they won't be able to keep up with you.
you mean it?
I mean it.
he means it.
excuse me. Sorry
come in, come in, come in.
no. - Why?
okay, hold it steady. Grey, get in there.
what do we have? Oh, my god.
here we go.
fishing boat accident. Something fell on him.
and the hook? - Looks like he fell on it.
pressure's at 68 systolic.
tracheal deviation and absent breath sounds.
get me a 14-gauge needle.
right behind you.
dad.
what are you doing to him? - Grey, get him outta here.
I'm trying.
Doug, please. - Go on, son. I'm all right. Oh, god.
what is that? What the hell is that?
dad, I-I don't know what happened.
I had the rope in my hand one minute, and... - Doug, Doug, come on.
no, I did this. I... I'm sorry. Dad, I'm so sorry.
it's... It's okay. It's not your fault.
of course it's his fault!
I was thrown on top of this shark hook because he let go of the rope.
who the hell's fault is it?
let's leave the hook in until we get him up to the o. r.
I'm feeling a depressed skull fracture.
all right. Go ahead and order a head c. t.
right away, chief.
that was the first thing he taught me when I joined the crew.
I don't know how...
we didn't play ball when I was little.
we tied knots. I know how to tie that knot.
Doug, you made a mistake. It was an accident.
what if it wasn't?
I've thought about it sometimes... Hitting him... Or hurting him.
he pisses me off sometimes and he's harsh and...
are you telling us you did this on purpose?
no, not on purpose.
I just... I don't... I don't feel so good.
okay, just try to relax.
deep breaths. Deep breaths.
okay, uh, Grey, order a head c. t.
and get a c. t. Angio.
I think I saw, uh, some fluid around his spleen. - I'll do it.
uh, I think there's some...
and I'll just deal with the vomit.
so, um, the nurse says I'm being discharged? I have to leave tomorrow?
I just had the baby, like, today.
well, that's a good thing.
it means you're doing great.
no complications.
right, little man?
well, where am I supposed to go?
my mom kicked me out, and those friends I was staying with in Portland were like, "you gotta pay rent or you gotta leave..."
and... I can't pay rent.
I don't have a job.
I don't have anything.
you can stay with me.
Really?
sure. Just until you figure things out.
you're gonna be okay.
Sloans are tough.
you hear that? We're tough.
um... Maybe we should... Keep him.
do you think you could?
maybe.
you want to hold him?
no. I...
I don't think I know how to... - Do you want to hold him?
he's pretty great.
look who it is.
Hi, baby.
look at that.
you're a natural.
it's up to you.
if you think we can do this, raise him...
together... If you think we can, then...
Hey, guys.
he really needs to go to the nursery to be monitored and get his newborn checkup.
I'm monitoring, and I did the exams. He's all good.
mark, when you get a minute, I'd love to have a quick word.
caught a big one, huh?
that's funny.
he's got a small hematoma.
Hey, can I ask you something?
why did you hire Altman?
What'd you see in her?
well, what do you see in her?
I think she's good. She works hard.
I feel bad even looking.
I'll feel worse, though, letting a stronger candidate pass us by.
not the feel-good job, is it?
can't you give me a little insight?
no. See, that'd be doing the job for you.
I'm not gonna give you the fish.
you got a big hook in there.
learn to fish yourself.
in 2007, the C.D.C. Marked crab fishing the most dangerous job in the u. s.
with an annual fatality rate 28 times higher than any other job.
what?
dude, it's like working with Forrest Gump.
the kid's 15.
he should be doing algebra, going to school dances.
how much you bet he did it?
what?
hooked his old man on purpose.
I'd say 70%, it was an accident, 30% attempted murder.
what? Karev's right.
too much nature makes people crazy.
Ah, okay.
there... Is the tear.
Grey, you want to embolize it?
Really? I've never done it before, but I-I read that if you use...
you want this kid to bleed to death or what?
don't analyze everything.
just... Do it.
tell me that you called the parents. - Sloan's having second thoughts.
Sloan picked those parents. She asked you to call them. She was pretty clear.
well, now she's not clear.
by law, she's got 48 hours before the court terminates her parental right.
Sloan changed her mind?
maybe. - That's great.
no, it's not. - What, she can't change her mind?
people change their minds.
this baby needs parents, not an 18-year-old child and a father who she met five minutes ago.
shut up! - Mark...
no.
you know, you don't get to tell me what to do here.
I appreciate your help, but you don't...
my mom is dead.
my dad's never gonna get off the couch again.
I don't have any brothers or sisters.
this is my grandson... My grandson.
I'm not just gonna turn him over to some strangers when I might have a chance at a family.
so just... Give me a minute here.
how's he doing?
his temp's high.
I - I can't figure out why.
is his dad in surgery yet?
Yeah, they're prepping him now.
Doug, would you like to see your dad before he goes into surgery?
he's probably calmed down.
he hates me. He's always hated me.
and now I practically killed him.
he doesn't want to see me.
once when I was little, I was really mad at my mom, and...
I had heard that saccharine can kill you,
I w... I was this close.
and while she was thinking of sweetening her mom's coffee, I tried to run my old man over with a car.
it's normal.
no, that's... That's not normal.
those hooks were meant to catch sharks.
he's never letting me near him or the boat again.
I don't even know where I'm supposed to go.
ow, my head is, like, pounding.
Hey, we should get blood cultures and a repeat c.b.c.
we need to find out why he's burning up.
you do that, sweet low. I'm gonna go watch them pull out a hook.
the baby smiled at mark.
he looked up and smiled at him like he knew him.
that poor baby's parents, just sitting... - Stop calling them the baby's...
that baby's parents...
the mature, capable, financially secure, emotionally stable, loving parents, who were deemed fit by Sloan and the state of Washington, are sitting there by the telephone staring at the sky blue nursery walls that they just painted.
those are the parents.
so she has a lot to learn.
no, she doesn't.
she made the one sound parenting decision she needs to make.
she found a lovely couple to raise her baby.
and she did that months ago, when she wasn't flooded with postpartum hormones or...
or overwhelmed by heartfelt pleas from her dad, when she had time to think clearly...
about what was right for her and... And what was right for the baby.
she made a decision, a good decision.
and it would... It would be great if we could all just try and respect that.
okay.
crap. Sloan.
is he okay? - I... I don't know. Uh, he won't stop crying.
well, what happened?
I- I don't know. I was just holding him, and mark went to get a bottle for him, and he started crying, and he's not stopping, and I think something's wrong.
what happened?
Sloan got worried.
she paged us. But the baby's fine.
Oh, he's just hungry is all.
no, I-I don't know how to do this. I don't...
you can't do it wrong, and we're right here if you need help.
no, no, no, he's crying.
I- I don't think... I don't think he wants me to do it.
please. - Here.
Oh, god. I don't feel so good.
well, you've been up all night. You're exhausted and dehydrated.
drink that.
thought I'd check to see how far along we are.
almost ready to extract the hook.
suction.
after they get him off the hook, we'll go in to evacuate the hematoma and plate the skull fragments, right?
no, I thought we'd throw him back in.
catch and release.
thank you, DR. Kepner.
well, Walter's lucky. It looks like he doesn't have to lose any lung.
Yeah, no thanks to his kid.
well, it was an accident. That happens.
that kid shouldn't have been there in the first place.
well, he's the guy's son... Family business.
there's something to be said for loyalty.
you put a person in a job like that because they have the skills to handle it, not because they're your friend or your kid.
are you intentionally equating me with the idiot son that dropped the crab cage on his dad or is that just a happy coincidence?
all right. We're ready to extract the hook from the man.
all right, nobody move but DR. Hunt.
on my count.
one... Two...
snagged an artery...
I'm... I'm sorry.
God bless you.
he's stabilized and ready for you.
I'm sorry.
look, if this doesn't go your way, please don't take it personally.
you're an incredible surgeon. I see that.
it's just that Evans has published dozens of times.
he's won awards. - She won a bronze star for service to her country.
does that not count?
and the anastomosis is done.
fine suture hook.
you're not using a side clamp?
Nah. It's a special technique.
I get a very clean... Very nice anastomosis this way.
much less trauma to the surrounding structures.
you just parachuted that vein graft down.
I - is that to avoid memory in the suture or tangles later on?
excellent observation, yang.
have you already applied for your fellowships?
Oh, I'm only in third year.
Oh, right. I forgot.
it feels like I'm working with a fellow.
thank you.
Oh, would you like me to cut the last suture?
that's okay. I already got it.
it looks like you've barely operated at all.
it's... It's so perfect.
well, that is the goal, DR. Yang. That is the goal.
excellent.
hook guy is stable for now. How's the kid?
crappy. Nothing to do now that we've finished with the angio.
Lexie's babysitting him.
have you, uh, seen Evans? It was amazing. Who saw?
dude, you're like a kid with trading cards, except with heart surgeons.
Yeah. I gotta have them all.
I thought teddy was the love of your life.
Oh, she is. She is.
but... Evans? Brilliant.
I mean, brilliant. I mean, so is she.
but... I love them both.
I'm a cardiothoracic whore.
what can I say? It feels so good.
speaking of whores, has anyone seen the love-struck intern fawning over my husband?
april's not an intern.
you bat your eyes like that, you're an intern.
Oh, don't worry. That's not Derek's thing.
anymore.
I was the love-struck intern. It is his thing.
no, he's grown out of it.
out of what, chicks who shave their legs and laugh at his jokes?
sure he's grown out of it.
I shave my legs.
sometimes.
you could always call him chief shepherd.
I don't make the rules. I'm just telling you, it's a thing.
powerful guys like adoring girls.
Oh, my...
look, whatever. Do what you want.
that baby's delicious.
Yeah. I was thinking I could take paternity leave.
you know, at least for a couple of weeks.
I could help Sloan get the hang of things.
I don't know if a couple of weeks is enough.
what? She's a good kid. She's got good instincts.
well, her instincts led her to put the baby up for adoption.
I don't know. She's unformed.
she's a baby herself.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know either.
Arizona wants to go to Spain.
she's picking a suntan over a family, which I don't get.
didn't she have, like, a happy, idyllic childhood?
totally. She talks to her parents every day... Every day.
part of which could be the brother thing.
what brother thing? - He died.
her brother died.
and I'm an idiot.
you have a cold. It could've happened to any of us.
Yeah, but it didn't.
it was me... On a day that shepherd is interviewing Evans for my job.
and... I'm the new girl here who no one really knows.
and even yang... Is in love with evans.
and I... ugh!
I have a freaking cold.
I'm sorry.
it's okay. Teddy. It's okay.
okay, what happened?
he became lethargic and febrile, coughed up blood. His sats dropped out.
his x-ray shows there's a large hemothorax where we took the hook out.
all right. Well, then we're gonna have to go back in.
the repairs must not have held.
you should get a c. t. To confirm before cutting into a patient that's unstable.
there's no time for that. You wait, and he could go into multisystem organ failure.
shepherd, you have to trust that I know what I'm doing.
I'll call up to the o. r. Let 'em know you're coming.
Yes, this is chief shepherd. We're gonna need a cardiac o. r.
you paged me? - Hey, what's up?
Doug has fever and rigors, and he's starting to get a productive cough.
so deal with it. Look, hook guy is tanking.
he coughed up blood or something, so they're taking him back to surgery. I want in.
wait. He... He coughed up blood. What did it look like? Was it like currant jelly?
did he have leukocytosis with a left shift? His p. a.c. o2. was 28, right?
I don't know, encyclopedia brown. I didn't memorize the chart.
let him go, grey. He has a surgery he wants to see.
thank you, DR. Bailey.
Dr. Bailey, both patients have productive coughs and signs and symptoms of sepsis.
I am probably wrong, but if I'm not, this is infectious.
you're probably not wrong. You're probably right.
why do you want to hand your big save over to Karev, who's gonna march around the hospital acting like he put it together?
I didn't. I...
you are handing your power over to a boy because he's giving you sex.
I'm not. I-I...
I'm DR. Bailey. I know everything.
and you have a superpower.
that memory of yours is a superpower.
and on top of it, you're a good doctor.
and yet, you're letting Alex Karev treat you like a scut monkey.
I don't care how good the sex is.
if that's what it costs, you're paying too much.
I'm... I'm not... - Scut monkey, all day.
doctor.
thank you.
I was right. - I know.
now what are you going to do about it?
Karev, what's the status on your patient?
temperature spiked, but the dude's doing fine.
we're running new labs.
Dr. Altman, stop.
Dr. Grey, you always shout at people right before they start operating?
Doug has Klebsiella pneumonia.
and I'm guessing Walter here does, too.
we need to start to imipenem, stat, or things could get ugly fast.
Klebsiella? - It's highly contagious in close quarters, like living on a crab boat for months at a time.
and I think that hem thorax is a mixture of blood and an empyema.
thanks for the heads-up. - Yeah, well, you were busy.
maybe we should open him to check anyway.
no, I,um...
I - I think I was wrong here.
get him out of the o.r. into the i.c.u. Now.
this day has to end.
Oh, tell me about it.
I was supposed to watch Tom Evans work.
meanwhile, I got stuck in an o. r. All day watching Teddy Altman decompose right in front of my eyes.
I don't understand. What's Tom Evans doing here?
taking a look around.
Why? You don't need Evans. You got Teddy.
I don't need Teddy if I've got evans.
what? No, you... You can't.
me and... Me and Teddy, w...
Oh, god. See, this is my point exactly.
I can't staff this hospital based on the fact that she's hunt's friend and your flavor of the month.
you know what? I'm just sick of worrying about this.
this job is exhausting.
I'm sorry. That's what you're complaining about?
screw you. I'm losing everything today.
everything!
go ahead.
how am I supposed to call a couple of strangers and tell 'em to come take my kid?
Sloan's your kid, mark.
you're not losing her.
they're not taking her.
Hey! Did you see me in the o. r?
you're an idiot. - What?
you really think that Evans is gonna take you under his award-winning wing?
he won't. He doesn't need you.
he doesn't care about students. He's a rock star, not a teacher.
he is a rock star. Teddy, he's totally a rock star.
I mean, did you see him in there?
he was like an octopus doing a million things, like cutting, retracting, suctioning all at once.
you think that I need you to hold my instruments when I operate?
you think that helps me save the patient?
I do it so that you can learn, Cristina.
I'd be a lot faster in the o.r. without you.
did you notice you never even touched that patient?
your gloves were totally clean at the end of surgery.
did you learn a lot? - Teddy, it was one surgery.
he's here for my job, Cristina. Do you really not get that?
if Evans is in, I'm out. So, you know...
good luck with your new attending.
I get it.
you watch parents go through...
horrible...
unimaginable pain every day.
and...
you went through horrible, unimaginable pain when you lost your brother.
and your parents never got over it.
but if we had a baby...
our baby's not gonna be one of those kids in your NICU.
our baby won't be your brother.
I mean, knock on wood, but...
do you know how happy our baby would be?
I'm gonna say this once...
and then I'm not gonna say it again.
I'm not broken. I'm not some psychodrama.
my lack of interest in having a child is not some pathology that you can pat yourself on the back for having diagnosed.
I like my life. I like it the way that it is.
I don't want it to change.
I thought I liked it with you in it.
I hope I'm not wrong.
wait.
I called your mother.
what? Why?
she kicked me out.
she's on her way. She misses you.
she's worried about you.
right. - I'm worried about you, too.
okay, if this is the part where you tell me that you talked to her and she convinced you that me keeping my baby was a bad idea because I'm young and irresponsible...
that's not what the conversation was about.
okay, well...
so you thought it over and you decided that you don't have time for a kid?
that's fine. I get it. You have a life. You're busy.
but you know what? I can handle this kid on my own.
no, you can't.
having a kid is hard.
and you are young and irresponsible.
and keeping him is probably a bad idea.
but if that is your decision, if that's what you want, then I'm in.
I'm all in.
I'm not too busy for my family.
but...
don't keep the baby for me.
you'll always have me.
and I'll always want you.
and that's true no matter what you decide.
you're my kid.
and I'm so happy...
I get to know you, Sloan.
I'm so happy about that.
what are you doing right now?
can we walk and talk at the same time? - Where are we going?
you need to talk to Derek shepherd about Teddy and why replacing her with Evans would be a huge mistake.
remember, be persuasive and strong. Use a lot of words.
Cristina, I am not 12.
I'm not saying that you're 12...
Dr. Yang, good work today.
uh, thank you, DR. Evans.
this is important.
look, before you say anything, I just want you to know that I think, uh...
she's a fine surgeon.
uh, Evans is interested?
Yeah, I think so.
well... Well, Evans is good. He's really good.
and patients would come here from all over. That would be...
that would be good for this hospital.
well, I'm glad you feel that way.
Yeah, and teddy has a lot of connections...
mainly on the east coast, so she'd be fine.
if that's what you decide...
she'd be fine.
thank you.
all right. Let's do a little push against them.
not bad, all things considered.
you like being captain?
do I like it?
no.
me neither.
you know what it beats, though?
ing captain.
come here, son.
you okay?
this was my fault.
and I'm sorry.
Thanks, dad.
now just remember, the Sloans, we bloom early.
so when you start to grow hair on your face, don't be shy.
live it up.
all the other guys will be jealous.
and it's okay to rub it in a little bit.
but not a lot.
you don't want to be considered too full of yourself.
no one likes a vain guy in the locker room.
Oh, my god.
is that him?
hey there.
hi there, little guy.
he's so beautiful.
this is, uh...
and, uh, this...
thank you.
he has your dad's chin.
what? That's crazy.
come in.
chief shepherd... Are you busy?
did you just call me chief shepherd?
I did. Go with it.
what are you doing with the shades?
no one can know.
no one can know what?
about our secret love, chief shepherd.
our secret love?
by the way, chief, I picked up your dry cleaning for you.
and I...
had your car washed.
and I dusted off your desk...
with my bottom.
is there anything else I can do for you, chief shepherd?
let me see if I can come up with a list of things.
Oh, chief shepherd.
give me a beer.
you screwed me today. That was my patient.
you made me look like a moron. Get your own beer.
you...
you can't be an ass to me all day and then expect me to give you respect.
you can't be an ass to me all day and then expect me to give you sex.
and you can stop with the patronizing nicknames.
I am a nice person who couldn't even bring myself to attempt matricide by sweet low.
that makes me charming to anybody else.
I am a nice person and I am nice to you.
so whatever your damage is, you better start to be freaking nice to me, or I am not spreading my legs for you anymore, no matter how much I may want to.
now give me a damn beer.
as doctors...
we have an arsenal of weapons at the ready...
my cousin's baby punched her in the face.
literally.
she had a black eye from a 1 year old.
who needs it, right?
I don't need that.
they scream, they're grimy, they...
smell like poop, and the house smells like poop.

as adults, we're told to look on the bright side,
to make lemonade and see glasses as half full.
you're staring again.
I am not. - You want to go back to my place and do it in the shower?
Teddy's in surgery tonight.

Henry? Henry stamm? Oh, my god.
It's-that- that's Henry Stamm.

Oh, well, all the more reason For you to wait a little longer for your reunion.
she'll be in room 31-28. Okay?
Betty Flynn. Oh, my god.

Oh, just a little something stuck in my head. You know how it is.

Yeah, that sums up your entire problem.
morning.
gentlemen.

indeed.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
it's okay, Hayley. Honey... - I'm not crazy.
the doctors are gonna help you.
you paged surgery?
Hayley may, 16, diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.
tried to claw her eyes out.
I need you to clear her Before I can take her to psych.
she tried to claw her eyes out?
we try to keep her safe. She's on every med in the book.
but she doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.
the slightest thing sets her off, talking even,
so we're having her committed.
we explained to her That they were coming to get her to try and help.
we turned our back for a minute, just for one minute
Oh, my god. Hayley
that's lorazepam in there.
I'll do it. I swear to god, I'll do it.
no, baby, please don't.
you don't believe me. Nobody does.
so now, I swear to god, I'll stab myself.
Hayley, I'm dr. Karev. Call me Alex.
I need you to put that down.
it'll kill me, right?
if I stuck this in my heart, it would kill me, right?
you don't want to do that, Hayley.
cause there's drugs in here, I would die, right?
trust me.
I can help you. - I'm not crazy.
I know. I - I... I believe you.
everyone outside thinks you're crazy,
but something's going on inside, And none of us understand.
so we need to figure out what that is,
and the only way we can do that is if you put that down And let me run some tests.
okay?
you promise?
Yes.
just put it down.
it's gonna be okay.
good. That's good.
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.
page shepherd.
I'd like to run some tests on Hayley. More tests? Look, we - we've been to doctors, okay?
Hayley is schizophrenic. She was diagnosed months ago.
Ken's father was schizophrenic.
he killed himself when ken was 8.
look, dr. Shepherd, It's just a few more tests, and-and she wants them.
Mr. And Mrs. May, believe me, I understand your frustration.
but I-it's possible something was missed.
honey, please.
fine. Okay?
thank you. I want to run an e. E.G. a cat-scan...
good morning, Amber and Trish.
um, Trish and Amber met in the burn unit.
best friends ever since.
Dr. Grey. - Amber Collier, 28,
presents status post-m. V.C.
amber was in a car when it flipped
and she was pinned under it while it burned.
driving while texting. We strongly recommend it.
Dr. Avery, will you please explain How we're gonna use a tissue expander?
we stretch healthy tissue injecting saline into a balloon Placed under the skull.
and today we'll remove that burned area And cover it with new tissue.
you promise that afterwards, It won't look like a comb-over, right?
I will do my best.
Dr. Sloan, dr. Bailey.
amber, how long have your fingers looked like this?
I don't know. They always look pretty bad.
you can still do my surgery, right?
we'll know more after we get me films on the fingers.
you're bummed out about getting a couple of x-rays?
you got a twin sister growing out of your head.
that's what you should be bummed about.
she was my wife's roommate...
her-her best friend.
and you haven't seen one another since then?
she was supposed to be in our wedding
my wife's maid of honor.
but she disappeared.
I - I figured that I would write her eventually
do you say, "I couldn't stand up in your wedding because I fell in love with your fiance?"
there was a party.
I- I-I remember, the sky was so clear that night,
and I went outside to look at the stars,
and there was betty.
it just...
happened.
I felt terrible.
it was wonderful.
he was my first.
she was my first.
Yeah, Irene and I were waiting for our wedding nights.
for the first time in my life, I felt complete.
being with Henry, I felt complete.
I wanted to tell Irene.
I wanted to call off the engagement.
would've been a terrible scandal.
and-and it would've ruined my friendship with Irene.
a - but of course,
the friendship was ruined anyway.
she just left.
she went to grad school across the country and...
and I...
I married Irene.
well, I-I loved Irene.
but she wasn't...
she wasn't Betty.
I told myself there'd be plenty of henrys in my life.
and were there?
my husband was a good man
kind, funny, smart
but he was no Henry.
there was never... Another Henry.
Dr. Torres...
I have an idea.
nearly 50 years later, and still all of those feelings.
that's saying something, isn't it?
is that a good idea? He just had a heart ablation.
I mean, he should be resting.
a happy patient is a healthy patient, yang.
this scan shows a diaphragmatic rupture from the fall. We have to get him in an O.R. Soon.
he can wait an hour.
let's let them catch up.
you're okay with this?
I'm with Webber. I can't help it. I'm a romantic.
you think she's schizophrenic?
I think she threatened to stab a syringe into her own heart,
so I'm leaning toward crazy, yeah.
scans are up. There's nothing in the frontal lobe.
or the temporal parietal regn.
occipital lobe's clean, too. - Crap.
told you. Crazy. - we tried, karev.
all the tests are negative. Okay?
let's go inform the parents and turf her up to psych.
look, this isn't right.
I know crazy. I-I grew up with crazy.
I dated crazy And I don't think this girl is crazy.
just give me some time.
do you have a specific diagnosis in mind?
no, but- - she's suicidal, Alex.
what you did in the E.R. You saved her life.
but those parents have been through hell.
look, you say it's our job to advocate for the patient
the patient, not the parents.
so whatever hell they've gone through, hers is worse.
I do say that, advocate for the patient.
you've got until my board meeting is over.
four hours. Go dig.
are we a couple?
what? - I need to know what we are, because people ask, And I don't know what to say. I - I'm over mark.
and I-I don't know if you're over Izzie,
but I am over Mark Sloan for real.
and I-I know-I know that we said that, you know,
this wasn't gonna be a thing, but I like you.
look, the point is, I want to know what we are, What this is.
we're a thing.
Yeah, we're together. We're...
we're a thing.
whatever.
Dr. Altman, Can I do the mesh repair of the diaphragm?
no, I can sew it up with a continuous suture.
and if you use stay sutures on either side of the laceration, - It can be tented down to aid closure. - I know. They'll help with closure.
that's quite a shorthand you two have.
we worked together a long time.
Yeah, I get it. I had that once with Ellis Grey and I,
from the first day we worked together.
I miss it.
she's got hyperacusis, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus. This blows.
so you and Lexie? - What?
I mean, I'm just saying, you and lexie, It's not just a sex thing anymore. It's a
I'm acting like a duck. - What?
I figure, if you walk like a duck And you quack like a duck,
eventually you start to feel like a duck.
Lexie is nice and normal and healthy.
I'm acting like A guy who can stick with nice and normal and healthy.
you're becoming a duck. - I am becoming a duck.
Cristina, seriously?
what's up with that?
she's mad at me because I planted seeds of doubt About her moving in with Owen.
don't talk to him about me.
well, why don't you come over here So I can talk to you about you?
I'll talk to you when you actually talk.
I mean, are you ready to talk?
Oh! I need the Lexopedia to diagnose my patient.
she's not a book you can flip through.
I kinda am. Go.
a 16 year old with hyperacusis, vertigo,
tinnitus, nystagmus...
Cholesteatoma...
or temporal lobe tumor.
for god sakes, will you just come over here? - No.
scans were clean.
uh, it's worse with sounds. We have to whisper.
Oh, uh, uh, page 162 in a June...
2004 issue of a journal with a mint green cover.
it's, uh, sound- or pressure-induced vertigo.
it's called, um... I can't...
crap. I can't see it. Um, I can't
it's like the computer froze.
june '04, mint green cover, it's in the research library.
got it. Thanks.
so mark slept with reed. Gross, right?
but you're with Alex.
I know. No, I'm just saying, it's-it's gross.
I mean, that-that's...That's all. I'm just... It's gross.
do you think I'm Thatcher?
is that what you were trying to tell me this morning, - That I-I'm Thatcher? - What?
Owen is Ellis, and, uh, Teddy's dr. Webber, And somehow I'm Thatcher in the situation?
I don't know. I don't know.
forget it.
I don't understand. You didn't find anything.
I just feel like we're torturing her for no reason.
okay, Hayley, we're gonna start now.
and when I say now, I want you to...Pinch your nose and blow.
make sure you keep your eyes open, okay?
now.
what's happening to her eyes? What's going on?
no. No. No. No. No!
no, no.
Hayley, honey, it's mommy. It's mommy. - No.
I'm right here. - What the hell did you do to her?
I just diagnosed her.
so you don't have a middle name?
like, for real?
my parents couldn't agree, So they decided not to bother.
Oh, we-we're just gonna have to do something about that.
um... How about cheeky?
Yeah. I like it. Got spunk.
take care.
Miranda, that was...
you have to cut off three of my fingers? - They're infected, amber.
it also means we have to postpone your hair restoration. I'm sorry.
amber, you survived a horrible car wreck.
you'll survive this, too.- I know, but
Hey, what do we always say?
we're both alive. That's what matters.
everything else is just bumps and bruises.
you can cry, amber. It's fine. It's a lot to take in all at once.
no, she needs to stay positive. That's how we get through. We stay positive.
she was excited, she was hopeful, she was eager,
and that has been crushed.
she has the right to have some feelings.
she can be positive tomorrow. You can be positive tomorrow.
thank you.
it's called superior canal dehiscence syndrome.
it's the result of a small hole that developed in her inner ear.
it's rare, and it's hard to diagnose.
the condition wasn't even written up until 1998.
the noise sensitivity, the sandpaper, it's because Hayley could hear everything going on inside her body.
and every sound outside was magnified.
that's why she couldn't sleep or eat. She's not schizophrenic.
w-was the sex with Altman- was it lousy? Did she disappoint you?
what? No.
no.
is one woman never enough for some men?
I- I-no, I-I really want to know, because I
me, I think I'm a good judge of character.
I - I am... A good judge of character,
and I-and I-and I think Altman is a good judge of character.
and then she trusted you.
she trusted you, and then you go...
I - I just want to know.
Teddy and I were never exclusive.
were you and your guy... exclusive?
we're-we're not talking about me.
at the end of the trail,
there's-there's an overlook.
you-you can see the entire bay from up there.
of course, the view would be even nicer
if I had someone to share it with.
come live with me.
Henry. - It's a nice place- warm, quiet.
we-we barely know each other.
we know each other.
we missed our chance once, betty.
I'd hate to make the same mistake again.
Betty... I need to-I need to get you up to surgery.
think about it.
that's all I ask.
I got over you...
I married mike, I had four kids,
now grandkids that give me such joy.
I got over you.
I'm sorry.
looks like that's just about it.
you want to have the anesthesiologist...
start lightening her up?
you could ask me directly. - Dr. Sloan?
you want to start lightening her up?
no.
wait.
I want to do the hair restoration.
at about the chance of infection? - Infection looked pretty isolated.
do you think we can do it?
seems to me that we are all in need of a little magic today.
right, dr. Bailey?
let's do it.
do you think your mom ever got over the chief?
you think she still loved him after all those years?
my mom loved Richard until the day she died.
what were you trying to tell me this morning
about teddy and Owen? Is there-is there something I'm not seeing?
Cristina- Meredith, please just- just tell me what you know.
just...- W-why?
you have to understand.
it's been just you and me for a long time.
and now it's me and Derek, and it's you and me.
and I told you what I said this morning Because it's you and me,
but I can't tell you any more because it's me and Derek.
fine. You know what? I get it. But I need you to understand
that I need there to be a me and Owen.
I hate your job.
I love you. - stop trying to make me happy.
do you think he loves her, Owen and Teddy?
I mean, do you think that that's why?- Meredith
I'm saying, when he threw her under the bus, - What read did you get? Do you think he loves her? - You can't tell Cristina.
I know that. That's why I hate your job.
want a hug?
Yeah.
Wow. Impressive technique. Who taught you that?
mark. He taught me one-handed ties, mattress stitches,
dual on lay bone grafts.
now he can teach his techniques to reed.
Lexie... - It's fine. I'm fine. I don't care.
I'm with Alex. I do not care about mark and/or who he sleeps with.
that's the same thing I keep telling myself about Arizona,
that I don't care. And you know what? Sometimes it works for the most part.
but then a patient gets asked to move across the country
for a man she barely knows, and all I can think is
how stupid they were to let each other go in the first place.
all I want Is for her to change her mind and say yes.
I want to believe.
okay, time to close off the canal.
you're using fascia and bone wax?
Yep, and then we'll cover it With the cortical bone graft we've harvested
and seal it with the fibrin glue.
she'll be good as new. - You cover a hole with a bone graft,
and this girl gets her whole life back.
wouldn't it be nice If everything in life were that simple?
I hoped it wouldn't leave such a big scar.
well, it'll look better in a couple of weeks, Once it has a chance to heal.
be doing shampoo commercials in no time.
and your hand is just bumps and bruises.
right?
I lost three fingers today, Trish.
that's not bumps and bruises.
I know that.
but we're alive.
it's better than the alternative.
I call in sick to work sometimes
because I just can't bear to drive.
I sit in my car in my garage...
and I'm so angry about what happened to me,
that I can't drive my car.
for hours, I just sit there.
does that ever happen to you...
that you're so angry you can't breathe? Because I do.
but I can't tell you that Because I'm afraid I'm being... Weak or ungrateful.
please. You are my best friend.
horrible things have happened to us. Can we just be real with each other for once?
I can't watch romantic comedies anymore
because... I just want to yell at the woman "you can't find Mr. Right? That's your biggest problem?
well, try having most of your face burned off,"you stupid, bitch.
see what a Freakin' pretty woman you are then.
I don't know.
thank you. - Oh, no.
Cristina loves you, And I want to, but I can't
because I want to punch you in the face right now.
I know you tried to have teddy fired.
and I believe it's because you love her.
and if you care about Cristina at all, you will tell her.
if you're actually the good guy that she thinks you are,
you will tell her. And if you don't, then I'll know
and you'll know that you are not that guy.
look, teddy...
wanted to say that- Look, I should've knocked. It's-it's that simple.
and it's that over.
talk to her. - I just did. She doesn't want to.
no, I'm not talking about teddy. I'm talking about Lexie.
you still love Lexie,
and sleeping around isn't gonna fix that.
and the reasons that you broke up little Sloan and the baby- they're not reasons anymore.
she's with Karev. - Yeah, well, Betty married Mike,
but she never got over Henry.
what?
look, you don't want 50 years to go by And then realize that you let the love of your life get away.
so go. Try.
you gonna try again with Robbins?
why not?
because my reasons are still reasons.
look, I don't understand. You told shepherd to hire dr. Evans over Teddy?
when I asked you to go to bat for her, You said that you did, so...
Meredith said...
Owen, what's going on between you and teddy?
Oh, nothing. Nothing is-god.
you want me to get better.
I want me to get better. And I have been working.
I have been working with dr. Wyatt To eliminate my triggers
okay, so-so- so Teddy's a trigger?
Teddy-I don't know what Teddy is.
Teddy-she triggers me, she confuses me.
I- I-I don't know. - Okay, well, you know what?
I don't know is not working for me right now. - I don't know is all I've got.
I shouldn't have to explain myself to - oh?
I don't know what I feel for teddy.
I don't know Because she's all wrapped up with everything else
with men being blown apart in front of me, with Beth.
so it's complicated and it is screwing with my head.
that's the truth. I don't know what I feel for her.
but I do know what I feel for you.
so, yes, I told shepherd to hire the other guy.
and I shouldn't have to explain myself...
so I can get myself better. How could you have done that to
I shouldn't have to explain myself to you
and I damn well do not have to explain myself Meredith Grey.
it's, uh...'s Henry Stamm.
he was talking to me,
and then he couldn't breathe. Arterial flutter again.
Cristina, get her out of here. - ma'am, I need to move you. Me, no, I'm not leaving him.
systolic's 80. We're gonna need to cardiovert.
Charaddles to 100. - charging.
you want to help him? Let go of his hand.
Oh, god.
hello. Your heart rhythm was irregular again.
we were able to control it for now,
but we're gonna need to insert a pacemaker Before you go home. You're gonna be okay.
I've called a colleague at your hospital at home, And he'll see you once we clear you to travel.
thank you.
you stayed?
you can't do that again.
if I'm gonna move halfway across the country To shack up with you...
you can't do that again.
Really?
you... You make me feel like the prettiest girl at the party.
when you look at me, I become a young girl again.
and I never stopped missing you, and I never stopped wondering.
I did the right thing once.
now I'd like to do the wrong thing And see how that goes
how long do you need me to wait before I propose?
Cristina-Don't.
she's starting to wake up.
remember, we're gonna take it slowly And see how it goes.
there's no guarantee that the surgery worked.
how you doing, Hayley?
I'm good.
I'm good.
I'm good.
Oh, my god. I'm good.
I'm good!
ask most people what they want out of life, And the answer's simple...
to be happy.
maybe it's this expectation, though,
the wanting to be happy...
that just keeps us from ever getting there.
I need to talk to you. - Hey, I get it.
you want to see other people.
so go. Be free.
get cheeky with Liz.
Liz is the meanest nurse on the floor.
she makes everybody in my department's life hell.
but she likes me.
she doesn't schedule me for work on Tuesday mornings
because she knows that's when I play golf.
she doesn't put me in the O.R. With Hendricks because she knows I can't stand the way he talks to himself when he operates.
and she does these favors for me because I flirt with her.
flirting makes my job easier.
and what you saw back there, that-that middle name stuff?
that's bad flirting, lazy flirting.
for you, who I actually like...
I break out my good flirting, my a-game...
because I mean it.
are you hearing me, Miranda?
I... I mean it.
I have a child...
and a full-time job.
and I'm going through a sad...
exhausting, stressful, time-consuming divorce.
I don't have time for games.
I mean, you understand that, right?
I do.
I do, and I'm not - I'm not playing games.
I'm in this for real.
okay?
okay.
you were right. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome.
page 162. You rock. I'm gonna drop these off,
then we're gonna head over to Joe's.
I'm still in love with you.
I tried not to be, but it didn't work.
and Sloan's gone...
there's no baby,
and I don't want to sleep around.
I want another chance.
I'm in love with you.
he's...
mark, I-I have a boyfriend.
I know.
I'm saying, you can have a husband.
maybe the more we try and will ourselves to states of bliss,
the more confused we get...
you ready? - Yeah.
to the point where we don't recognize ourselves.
instead, we just keep smiling...
trying like hell To be the happy people we wish we were.
until eventually it hits us, it's been there all along...
what do you think of this right here, Putting in the fireplace in the master bedroom?
I'm gonna get something to eat.
I'm not moving in with owen.
see this... Right here?
this is your room.
you have a room uhat the new house in the woods.
my own room?
yes - Thank you.
not in our dreams or hopes
but in the known,
the comfortable...
the familiar.
every cell in the human body|regenerates, on average, every seven years.
like snakes...
in our own way, we shed our skin.
biologically, we're brand-new people.
are you visiting Seattle|for the first time?
Oh, no, no. I live in Seattle.
I|- I just went home for a month. I took my son to see my parents.
what do you do in Seattle?
uh, I'm a surgeon.
uh, uh, did you know|any of those doctors from that shooting?
we may look the same.
we probably do.
the change isn't visible...
at least not in most of us.
but we're all changed...
completely...
forever.
but that's normal.
I mean, it's a biological|imperative-change.
so the shooting changed me.
I'm changed.
but I'm also ready to get back to work.
I mean, as ready as any of us are.
sitting around the house, waiting...
I just spend my time worrying.
your husband was shot.
that's a lot to worry about.
I'm worried about Cristina. She's|getting married, and that's just...
well, I had to cut her out of her|last wedding dress with scissors, so...
you watched your husband get shot.
he's fine. He's coming|back to work today, actually.
we're all fine.
uh, ex-excuse me.
is everything okay, Dr. Grey?
Yes.
everything's fine.
opening two.
it doesn't look too bad.
you just gotta keep an eye on it, make|sure it doesn't get any bigger.
but if it changes color, you|should see a doctor.
Dr. Shepherd.
your lady looks pissed.
again, Derek?
what?
nothin'. Just...
you're awesome.
chief.
Oh, Dr. Bailey. Welcome back.
thank you, sir.
we missed you here.
the place isn't the... Same.
uh, did you get cleared for surgery?
what do you mean,"cleared for|surgery"? Who has to clear me?
well, the next time, i'll leave you there.
you said that already.
Oh, Derek got arrested again.|-Meredith...
reckless endangerment.|-Please.
did he lose his license yet?
Oh, no, because they don't charge|him, because the cops worship him.
because I saved some of their lives.
what are we picking?
dress color.
I'm not wearing white.
it's sexist and...
vaguely racist.
no white, no veil, no rice.
well, what will your mother say?
no mother.
you know, I didn't get|cleared for surgery...
and I'm pretty sure it's your fault.
Meredith, I am the chief. I|can overrule the counselor.
you can?|-Yes.
I love the blue.
chief Shepherd, you're back. Okay.
I find a giant skull base chordoma.|Biggest one I've ever seen.
he came in to the E.R. with trouble breathing.
you got cleared for surgery?
I did.|-Bitch.
I like the brown, too.
I know it looks inoperable.
I mean, I would've said it was|inoperable, but you're back and you're you.
right.
Hey, uh, yes, good morning. Thank you.
thank you very much.
good. Thank you. Thank you very much.
it's, uh, it's great to be back.
first of all, I'd like to thank Dr.|Webber for stepping up in my absence.
thank you.
uh, I'm grateful for all of you, for|all of your support during my recovery.
thank you.
uh, it's just, uh, so great|to be back as chief.
I'm grateful for the, uh...
I'm sorry. That's a lie.
that's what people|say, and, uh, the truth is...
I hate being chief.
I hate it.
chief webber...
chief webber is our chief.
and I'm sorry, but this giant...
sorry, I gotta go look at this chordoma.
I, um, I'm sorry, but...
I quit.
let's go, Kepner. Come on.
Oh, sorry. Okay.
he just quit.
he was supposed to clear me for surgery.
Yeah.
the bullet's at the|surface. That's good.
I can take it out now.
Nah. I mean, if it's not|infected, I'm gonna keep it.
it's my war wound.
besides... Chicks dig that crap.
Oh, my god.
you weren't kidding.
the last surgeon broke the dura, which enabled the tumor|to mushroom into the brain and down into the spine.
it's wrapped around his brain stem.
whatever we do, we need to do it quickly.
the size of this thing...
normally I open up the|sinuses or the hard palate.
well, now you have to open up both.
you want me to split|his whole face open?
sinuses, hard palate, tongue, jaw
a broken jaw is excruciating, let|alone the rest of it.
does this kid know what he's in for?
he wants to live. I don't think|he's concerned about the pain.
well, but you don't know|how enmeshed the tumor is.
you don't even know|if you can get it all.
thank you, Dr. Grey.
you want to try this thing, Torres|and I are gonna need to coordinate.
what are we thinking, a week?
no later.
I'll clear my schedule.
welcome back, Dr. Shepherd.
thank you, Dr. Torres.
you're not even cleared for surgery yet.
I'll get cleared.
uh, Dr. Grey.
chief webber.
Yeah, a little|- Little exercise.
okay.
something I can do for you?|-Yeah.
um, that stupid counselor Perkins, he|won't clear me for surgery.
so I was just wondering|- No.
but he cleared-|I'm-i'm sorry. I am.
but we brought in the best, and when Andrew Perkins says you're not cleared, then it's him you need to talk to.
did you hear that Dr. Yang and|Dr. Hunt are getting married?
I did.
it's pretty great, huh?
it's almost like a silver lining.
you know, I-I've read a lot about trauma and|how, uh, sometimes people just up and change their lives.
they say that the trauma was the best|thing that could've happened to them.
you know, like Dr. Shepherd this morning.
did you hear that|he's not chief anymore?
and how have you been, Dr. Grey?
you've been through a|lot since I last saw you.
does, uh, anyone have anything to say?
I know that, uh, a lot of you are only|here because this has been mandated.
so let's talk.
anything at all?
I ate a really good taco from one of|those trucks by the side of the road.
when?|-Last night. You were asleep.
which truck? The one on 7th?
I want to go. I like tacos.|-Me, too.
I read a book...
about the history of|mass murders in the U.S.
that's-that's the actual|name of what happened to us.
it was a mass murder.
you can't call it a terrorist attack, because|the murders weren't political in nature.
and we weren't the|victims of a serial killer, because Mr. Clark would've had to murder several people over a|period longer than 30 days in order to qualify as a serial killer.
we could call it a spree killing...
which is defined as killings at two or more locations with no break or pause|in between, because Mr. Clark shot that guy in his car before he got here.
but I'm not sure that that counts as a true second|location since it was so close to the hospital, which means that we were a mass murder, because it happened at one place, by one|person, and more than four people were killed.
Oh, that was quite a show this morning.
I didn't plan it.
made it better. Any regrets?
no. Any regrets about|proposing to cristina?
none.
getting shot turns out to not|be the worst thing after all.
I need a best man.
I- I know- I know we're|not that close, but...
I don't know. You being married|to the other twisted sister, I...
I just thought it...
it kinda made us like|brothers or something.
I'd be honored. It's an honor.
thank you.
you need a bachelor party?
no, no, no.|-Even better.
on the, uh, day of the shooting, I understand|that you had a particularly difficult day.
on the day I gave birth to my|son, my husband had a car crash, and he needed a craniotomy, and he|almost died on derek shepherd's table.
now that was a|particularly difficult day.
and at the end of that day, my|son was born, and my husband lived.
but at the end of this day...
the, uh...
No! No!
this day was the worst day of my life.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
no, you-you don't just|sneak up on people. Okay?
you don't|- I got these.
I was, um, I was playing golf.
my phone was off, and I'm...
you know, 18 people got|shot, 11 died, one in my arms.
a boy died in my arms, and|you were playing golf.
Okay.-Bailey
we gotta go.
well, where|- Where you going?
home, uh, to my mom.
right?
yeah? We're gonna go see grandma?
Yeah, Tuck. Here you go.
when you coming back?
okay, here, here. Here's your car.
Miranda, w|- When are you coming back?
okay, okay, okay, okay.
okay, Tuck.
no.
no.
m|- mom.
you're talking about slicing his face in|half, breaking his jaw, cutting his tongue.
it's just|- It just sounds crazy.
I know.
I wish I could offer some comfort, but honestly, there's no comfort that|can be offered in this situation.
let me just say that...
every medical advancement started|with the statement,"that sounds crazy.
let me try.
Donna, let me help.
okay. Let's try. Let's...
okay.
good. Okay.
he could not wake up.
he could...
wake up... And never|be able to move again.
he could go blind.
he could lose his ability|to speak or to eat.
he could require around-the-clock|care for the rest of his life.
he could be in a tremendous amount|of pain for the rest of his life.
he could die on the table.
if that doesn't happen, if|none of those things happen, he's still facing months of excruciatingly|painful recovery from this surgery.
and before you make a decision, you|need to understand the risks.
you're driving awfully|fast, Dr. Shepherd.
the least you could|do is wear a seat belt.
you've been working.
in the clinic, in the pit.
we haven't been allowed to operate, which|makes zero sense if you ask me.
I'd like to, uh, talk to you|about the incident last week.
she's not my responsibility.
she was your girlfriend.
well, she's not anymore.
Karev, give me another suture.
my patient didn't bring her meds.
she doesn't even know their names.
I|- if I give her albuterol and she's on propanolol, then she'll stop breathing.
if-if I give her warfarin and she's on|ibuprofen, then she'll-then she'll bleed out.
if I give her diphenhydramine and|she's on doxepin, then she'll die.
so do-do-do you think|she wants to die?
is she kidding?
Karev, what's going on over there?
I think that she wants to die.|I think she wants me to kill her.
do-do you-do you- Do|you want me to kill you?
because you|- you could just get a gun, and it would be a lot faster.
Karev, get her outta here.
you know what? So why|doesn't somebody find a gun...
and we'll bring her a|gun and just shoot her...
Karev, help her. I can't step away.|-'cause she obviously wants to die!
get her out of here! -Help! Somebody|find her a gun 'cause she wants to die!
I got my own stuff to do.
somebody find something!
why did you walk away?
look, life is too short.
I almost died trying to stop that guy.
besides, I mean...
you know how much tail you get offered when|you're carrying a bullet around in your chest?
it's like I'm a legend.
are you, uh...
always this crass, or is|that a defense mechanism?
I've had too much|crazy for one lifetime.
you cleared Lexie Grey for surgery?
Dr. Sloan, I'm in|- I'm in session.
I had to check her into psych last week.
I had to commit her against her will!
and you just clear her for surgery?
what the hell kind of doctor are you?
it's okay. You can talk to him.
I'll come back.
Yeah, walk away.
you're good at that.
she got snowed.
psych put her on heavy doses|of antipsychotics and benzos.
and then she slept for|almost 50 hours straight.
when she woke up, she was no|longer a risk to herself or others.
I mean, she has p. t.s. d. Most of you do.
for her, it caused severe sleep|deprivation and led to a breakdown.
all she needed was sleep.
so protocol is that|she goes back to work.
see?
I'm okay.
really. I'm back.
clamp.
so how are you?
I hear there's a guy.
Yeah, there's a guy.
that good?
shut up.
I need another clamp.
so... You're getting married.
I am. I am getting married.
I'm happy for you.
I am, really.
Really?|-Yeah.
thank you.|-Good.
I dig weddings.
I do a mean chicken dance.
Oh, there will be no chicken dance.
and if you start a conga line, I|will physically throw you out.
I just went to the cafeteria, and|some nurse called me Reed and then said,"I thought you died.
Yeah, you don't go to|the cafeteria for lunch.
they just point and stare.
is that why you dyed your hair?
they stare because we should've died.
pack a lunch. Keep it in your locker.
you are kidding me. You got cleared?
it's down to you and Yang.
that is not funny.
well, Perkins is no dummy.
he can see the crazy right|under the Meredith Grey surface.
again, Cristina, it's not funny because|you're not gonna get cleared either, and the two of us are gonna be|serving slushies at the multiplex.
Really?
I'd choose dermatology over multiplex.
no, I'd go gynecology over dermatology.
Oh, of course you would.
perv.
I think I'd go with psych.
that was a joke.
that was good.
anyway, I don't know what|Perkins' problem is with me.
maybe he saw your file.
maybe he knew your mother.
maybe he heard how you told|the shooter to shoot you.
not funny.
not a joke.
Dr. Bailey.
welcome back.
you okay?
I'm happy to see you all.
Karev, there's a patient in|23-04 that needs an endoscopy.
grey and Yang, surely your paycheck covers|more than stuffing your face in the basement.
get to the clinic now.
and, you two...
I'm awful sorry about|the loss of your friends.
thank you.|-So are we.
22-13 has a bowel impaction, and I'm sure as|hell not about to stick my hands in there.
you, uh, quit your job this morning.
should I be worried about impulsivity?
I didn't quit my job.
being chief wasn't my job.
I'm a surgeon.
that's what I do.
that is who I am.
but before you got shot
Oh, I wanted to quit that job every day before|I got shot, I just didn't have the guts to do it.
after I got shot, I, uh......
life is short.
so now I think less and...
just do.
so...
for you, the shooting was clarifying?
a l-a lot of people|died in that shooting.
I'm saying, in your life today...
a lot of people died.
Meredith went to get something|to eat. She should be back soon.
I'm sorry I got you shot.
by coming out of the office|- I didn't listen, and then you got shot.
I...
I got you shot, and I just|need to say, I am so...
April...|- So sorry.
Gary Clark came here for me.
I gave the order to pull|the plug on his wife.
I got everyone shot.
is this what I need|to do to get cleared?
Dr. Grey, you're early.
I'll, uh, I'll call you later.
Yes, please.
that was creepy and inappropriate.
I want a new counselor.
Teddy was never a|- a patient of mine.
she was cleared for|surgery before I got here.
we just met in the cafeteria.
I'm not interested in your love life.
I don't care how love|blooms over day-old hot dogs.
my husband is about to remove|the largest chordoma on record.
you cleared Lexie Grey last week.
you cleared Alex Karev, who insists on running around the|hospital with a bullet in his chest.
I know who I've cleared.
so then why don't you tell me what|you want me to say, and I'll say it.
Dr. Grey, I don't think that you're|being honest... With me or yourself.
and I think that's a|potentially dangerous situation.
so what is it that you're not saying?
who's with Derek?
uh, when I left, um, Mark Sloan was with him.
and where's Owen?
um, I don't know. I- I-I think|he's still talking to the police.
okay, not a word of this to Derek.
you have to tell Owen because he knows.
not a word. - Okay.
and April Kepner. She knows, too.
okay.
well, go-go-go|tell them.
go-go back to the hospital|and tell them right now.
don't you want me to stay for this?
no, I want you to go.
go and-and make sure no|one says a word to Derek.
okay.
your friend left? You|want me to wait or...
no, just do it.
the d&c's pretty straight forward.
the fetus was only at about 5 weeks.
you'll feel some cramping|after, but it shouldn't be too bad.
andrew and I just got|busted by Meredith Grey.
Callie's watching me sleep.
what?
she's watching me sleep.
and she only watches me|sleep when something is up, and I'm afraid that|she's gonna propose or...
start talking about making babies again, which I'm-i'm open to, honestly, just|not right now, you know?
and I can feel her watching me, and it is such hard work to keep my eyes|closed, but I know that if I open them, that something loaded is gonna|come out of her beautiful mouth and pop the pretty pink bubble|that we've been floating in.
you want to pop the bubble.
I don't, though.
believe me. I've been living|in that bubble for years.
Oh, no. Owen and I? We're|just friends, really.
finally knowing the|truth? I don't regret that.
my bubble is so pink and so... Pretty.
I heard you were looking for me.
the board officially|reinstated me this morning.
no more " interim chief.
well, I'm glad to hear that.
you sure? No seller's remorse?
Oh, have you seen the tumor I'm chasing?
no, no seller's remorse.
you feel good about this surgery?
that sounds like a loaded question.
look, I know Perkins|cleared you for surgery.
and I know better than to|question your judgment, but...
I still have nightmares, and I|go to two A.A.Meetings a day.
I'm not all the way|back, and I didn't get shot.
that's what I mean when I|say, do you feel good about it?
I feel adrenaline.
and, yeah... The adrenaline feels good.
I can't believe i'm not down there.
I can't believe I'm not down there.
palate's divided.
Torres.|- Yeah. Okay. We're good.
here we go.
you ever see anything like this?
I've seen mortar fire that|didn't do this much damage.
all right, let's bring that|microscope in and get you started.
everybody ready?
let's do it.|- Yeah.
okay.
there's the tumor.
we're there. Microdissectors, please.
get up.
no.|- Get up.
let's go.
sorry, sorry.
what is wrong with you?
everything is wrong.
Derek is decapitating a teenager, and April Kepner is assisting, and you're sitting reading about|lilies of the freakin' valley.
well, you prefer peonies?
we are not better.
Cristina, a psychiatrist, given|several opportunities, has deemed unfit to do my job.
well, he'll get over it. Just|go back in a couple of days.
you are not better.
well, in a couple of|days, I'll be better, too.
in a couple of days, you'll be married.
are you trying to talk me out of this?
look at me and tell me you're sure.
okay, you know what? No. You|don't get to do this. Okay?
all you get to do is|help me break the tie between the lilies of the valley|and the-and the peonies. That's it.
no, I do get to do this.
I mean, Derek's the love of my|life, but you're my soul mate.
I do get to do this.
I mean, why can't it wait six months?
please don't. Don't.|- Your flowers aren't going anywhere.
you broke up with him because|he couldn't choose you.
don't. don't do this.|- Just why does it have to be right now?
you know what I think? I think you|should tell Derek about the miscarriage.
we're talking about you.
we're talking about|us not being " better.
then you need to tell him.|- He's not ready. His not okay.
well, you're not|okay. You should tell him.
well, Dr. Yang, if you don't|feel ready, there's no pressure.
the hospital is prepared to|work with you in whatever way
please don't. Don't.|- Your flowers aren't going anywhere.
you broke up with him because|he couldn't choose you.
don't. don't do this.|- Just why does it have to be right now?
well, you didn't show up for|your appointment last week.
you were very late today.
I'm getting married.
I heard that. Congratulations.
can I go now?
when you think about going into an|O.R.how does that make you feel?
God, the women in these magazines... Some|of them are actually brides, you know?
they're not all models.
all smiling.
it's like the only thing in|the world that matters is that they find the perfect|shoe to match that dress.
God, you know, I knew these girls.
I w-I went to school with them.
it's funny.
I used to feel sorry for them.
they're simple girls.
they just want to find the guy and|get married, you know... And live.
I don't know. I think you're either|born simple or you're born...
me.
I want to be the person who gets|happy over finding the perfect dress.
I want to be simple.
cause no one holds a gun|to the head of a simple girl.
stop fixing him!
Owen, help.
who is it?
I|- it's me. It's owen.
you're late.
I'm sorry.
it's not okay.
Cristina, what is this?
I don't want to be alone.
you don't ever have to be alone again.
I'm not going anywhere, Cristina.
I won't ever leave again.
you hear me? I am not|going anywhere, Cristina...
if you let me stay.
thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was late.
thank you.
Miranda, look, um...
I|- I was playing golf.
and I-I can't apologize for it because|it wasn't anything I did on purpose.
I|- I was just...
I was playing golf.
I missed you, and I just
you're... You're a good man.
you are handsome... And|kind... And smart and... Good.
I mean, you're perfect.
but, um... I'm... Busy holding|myself together with tape and glue.
and a piece of me wishes that|you hadn't played golf, because...
then you'd be all taped and glued, too.
and maybe you'd be where I am.
you're... You're too|much for me right now, 'cause I'm busy with|the tape and the glue.
all right, all right.
all right.
you take care of yourself.
you, too.
you were amazing in there.
let's make a baby.|- What?
come on.
let's just pull the goalie. Let's|do it. Let's start right now.
W|- Oh, god.
it's Greg. Damn it.
I|- I already gave him 10 of morphine.
he's in too much pain. I'm|gonna start him on propofol.
I never should've let you do this.
all right, Greg. It's Dr. Shepherd. You|have to listen to me.
Greg. Greg. Greg, this is the fight.
this is the fight.
the pain's gonna|stop. We're gonna help you.
but until it does, this is your fight.
the tumor's not driving anymore. You are.
you're in the driver's seat.
the life that's in your|head? You get if you fight.
you got it?
good.
good.
Donna, look, this|- This pain?
it's not a dying pain.
it's a healing pain.
this is a victory pain.
okay.
you won.
we won.
what?
I went out to get some ice.
Oh, don't be mad. We'll make the wedding.
I'll make the wedding.
just wanted to see you|were alive for myself.
you look hot.
the whole, uh,"crazy|eyes, tight dress" thing, it's, uh, it's working for|you, for whatever it's worth.
you think that you are so|badass 'cause you lived.
I'm the reason that you lived.
and while you were dying, you were|crying out for the wife who left you.
so that's the opposite of|badass, for whatever it's worth.
I'm jealous.
I think I'm jealous of Hunt and Yang.
you know Derek's gonna be the best man?
we hardly even know the guy.
I'm gonna do it.
you're drunk.|- That's why I'm gonna do it.
lame surgery ran|long. Sorry. What'd I miss?
I have something... To ask you.|- Oh, no.
I want you to move in with me.
I love you, and you have|a drawer and a toothbrush, and I want you to have a|whole dresser and a whole...
blow-dryer or something...
more romantic than that or... Something.
you're doing great. Push through.
okay.
unless you're just totally hating|the idea, which... Would be okay.
is that it?
is what it?
you just want me to move in to a|place that I basically already live?
thank god. Yes, yes. Calliope, yes.
I would love to have a dresser and a|blow-dryer or something more romantic.
how are you doing? You okay?
I'm okay.
uh, Derek?
uh, I'm sorry. He's not coming.
he's my best man.
I know.
do you want to pick a new one?
mark looks great in a suit.
Derek had the ring.
I have it.
Oh, okay.|- Okay.
are you still good?
Yeah.
okay.
she is gonna come down|those stairs, right?
I never gave you any|crap about your post-it.
you look beautiful.
I know.
how's Owen?
is he good?
Owen's perfect.
he's perfect.
thank you.
......
because change is literally the|only constant in all of science.
energy...
matter...
it's always changing...
Morphing...
merging...
growing...
dying.
it's the way people try not|to change that's unnatural...
the way we cling to what things were|instead of letting them be what they are...
the way we cling to old memories|instead of forming new ones...
the way we insist on believing...
despite every scientific indication...
that anything in this|lifetime is permanent.
change is constant.
how we experience change...
that's up to us.
it can feel like death...
or it can feel like a|second chance at life.
if we open our fingers, loosen|our grips go with it...
it can feel like pure adrenaline...
like at any moment...
we can have another chance at life...
like at any moment...
I do.
we can be born all over again.
we doctors take pride in the fact that we can basically sleep standing up...
anytime, anywhere.
stop. Stop!
what? - Stop. Stop.
I'm sorry, but you need to take something.
Where's charles?
Where's charles?
Hey, stop.
it's lexie. Wake up.
time for work?
Yeah, just about.
but it's a false pride, because the truth is...
after about 20 hours without sleep...
you might as well just come to work drunk...
doctor or not.
so it's no wonder that fatal medical errors increase at night...
when we doctors are proudly...
sleeping on our feet.
and our egos have been wounded by new laws that require that we sleep all day before we work all night.
Dr. Shepherd. There's french toast and coffee if you want breakfast.
it's 6: 00 p. m.
right. Um, bacon for your dinner?
thank you, no.
we're not happy about it.
but as someone who may one day need medical care...
you really should be.
it's night of the living dead out there.
I'm still sleeping.
a whole day happened while you were sleeping.
let's see. I did three aneurysm surgeries.
I consulted on a massive spinal tumor.
that was neat. Got the phillips grant.
and oh, by the way, the, uh, soup of the day in the cafeteria was potato leak soup.
Yeah, i got the grant.
you got the alzheimer's grant?
Yeah, i got the alzheimer's grant.
mark is putting together a little celebration at joe's.
but i would much rather celebrate here with you.
I am late for work.
gotta love the night shift.
proud of you. - Thank you.
nice face.
well, at least i can do surgery.
how's that hand?
Ah, it'd be better if you hadn't run your face into it.
so he beats the hell out of you, and now you're laughing about it?
you're sitting on my coat.
and some of us can't.
did you just yawn? Was that a yawn?
don't tell us that you're tired after getting to sleep all day.
it's not as easy as it sounds.
not easy?
not e-- when i was a resident, i actually worked for a living.
I did every other night call for five years.
there were days that i didn't go home for 72 hours.
I loved it.
sorry. I didn't quite catch that, karev.
uh, karev, i need you to follow up on my post-ops.
and here. Take this research.
divide out all the fistula cases.
Avery and little grey, hunt is wag for you in the pit.
all right.
try not to screw up our patients.
good night and good luck.
gonna be over at the bar. Try not to need us.
Dr. Grey? Shepherd's wife?
you're with me tonight.
Yes. - Good. I heard you're good.
listen, i'm late for dinner, so, um, i made a list of my patients, their protocols.
basically, everybody's stable. Just try and keep 'em that way.
and if i need to get in touch with you, sir?
you won't... 'Cause you're good.
nice to meet you.
everybody else is stable. Watch i. c.u. bed 12.
he may need to be intubated, and call me if there are any major traumas.
how you feeling?
what, my hand? It's fine. Just a little bruised.
no, i'm not talking about your hand.
trauma demands a cool head.
if you're not up to this, then-- no, i'm good. Thanks.
Karev and i are cool. That's, uh... Over, out of my system.
you don't have to prove anything here.
if you need a couple of shifts off-- i said i'm good, sir.
all right.
I'm... I'm not asking you to talk to me.
I'm telling you... Talk to someone.
have a good night, sir.
Hey, there you are. - There's the man of the hour. Congratulations.
thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
first round is on me.
um, guys.
there. Yeah.
no, try again. You need to tilt the glass li i said.
tilt.
I'm tilting it. Okay, i know. I know.
I'm telling you to tilt the glass. - Just let me try again, okay?
all right.
why are you behind the bar?
uh, owen told me to get a job, so i'm working.
what's everyone drinking?
she sat on the sofa for three days straight watching infomercials and eating cereal out of the box, so yeah, yeah, i-i told her to get a job.
but you didn't specify what kind.
well, i thought she'd go to a lab or the morgue. I didn't expect this.
well, tell her you changed your mind.
tell her she can be a housewife for all you care.
I think that the only thing she'd be worse at than bartending is housewifing.
what's so bad about bartending? She's not dancing on a pole.
you know, i give this one night.
I mean, cristina yang of beverly hills-- she does not enjoy serving people.
all right!
I call this the early onset alzheimer's because you won't remember anything after you drink it.
to shepherd and his genius brain crap.
to shepherd. - Thank you.
Oh, my god. This is strong.
Yeah, i'm gonna need a scotch.
Yeah, make it two.
early onset alzheimer's-- you don't think that's a little distasteful?
I think it's delicious.
Cristina, um-- um, you want a beer?
no, no, i'm on call. I want to talk.
you know, a bachelor party just came in.
uh, uh, we'll talk later.
all right! - Yes.
is someone getting married?
he said any major traumas.
we are not calling hunt.
we don't even know what this is yet.
E. r.'s swamped. We had to split trauma 3 and put 'em both in there.
did you call dr. Hunt? - We are not calling hunt.
all right. On my count. Ready?
one, two, three.
Reilly, you okay?
Lucas, it hurts.
it hurts really bad.
you'll be okay, ri, all right? - We'll be okay.
what do we got? - Car versus train.
2 brothers, 17 and 15, tried to outrun the coast starlight to portland.
the train won. - I know. It was stupid.
it was so stupid. I'll never do it again.
driver was inside the car.
the other was thrown out. No seat belt.
Dr. Avery, come take a look at this.
Yeah.
call hunt.
Mrs. Mcneil, i'm dr. Grey.
I'll be taking over for dr. Stark tonight.
drew's in a lot of pain.
okay, well, that's not unusual for this type of chest surgery.
abdominal pain is not normal after pectus excavatum surgery, and it's been going on for two hours.
it's okay, drew, honey pres. Mommy's right here.
his abdomen does seem a little tender.
I'm concerned about his vitals.
and i know my son. He's not a complainer.
something is wrong.
can you please call dr. Stark?
I will. I'll call him right away.
what, you're back already?
that date wasn't even, like, what, an hour?
I need a drink.
Ooh, careful.
that was mine. Now you have to order me another one.
Oh, god. That's disgusting.
right. Okay, so get this-- his very first question
so what's your favorite food? - what'd you say?
French, but that's not the point.
why would he ask me what my favorite food was?
like he read that that's some good icebreaker from some internet handbook that was handed out at the loser fair?
this is why you don't meet people on the internet.
you're married! You don't get to have anpinion about my pathetic forays into internet dating.
you do need a drink.
thank you.
go to africa.
what? - Arizona's an idiot.
and she's a fool, and you need to go there and tell her that i told you to say that dating is evil, and that what the two of you have is rare, and--and that she's an idiot.
get on an airplane and go to africa, and thank god that you never have to go on a first date again.
Yeah, i'm not going to africa.
well, then you're just as big an idiot as she is.
Torres is a grown woman.
you can't make her do something she doesn't want to do.
okay, again, Mr. Perfect married guy, you don't get to open your mouth,'
cause wh-- - Get ready. get ready. One, two...
Chug! Chug! Chug! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
who's first?!
what the hell did i miss?
you guys superglued yourselves together... On purpose?
apparently my son and girlfriend's love is so great, they can't hear you.
Yes, they superglued their arms and hands together on purpose.
uh, why--why would they-- we're moving to wisconsin tomorrow.
no, you're moving. Dad, i'm staying here with lauren.
no, you're not. You're going to wisconsin with me and your mom and the dog and the cat.
no, not without lauren. I'm not.
nobody can tear us apart, mr. Nystrom.
I know that, lauren, but the doctor here is still gonna give it a try.
I wish we could glue our lips together forever.
me, too.
I-I will-- i will figure something out.
thank you.
okay. Have you ever had the tiramisu at gino's trattoria?
excuse me?
tiramisu, gino's trattoria, uh, ladyfingers soaked in rum?
no, i haven't.
neither have i, because you felt the need to drag me away from my dinner to examine a kid with gas.
gas? I thought...
Oh, when i called you, he was in a lot of pain and his vitals were borderline.
they're better now because i gave him a liter bolus of i. v. fluids at 20 cc's per kilo.
but his pain-- yet what you should've given him was an antiflatulent.
abdominal pain after chest wall surgery in a patient on narcotic painkillers is gas or constipation until proven otherwise.
but, Dr. Stark, what if his pain is-- tiramisu.
Avery, what do you have?
large, gaping wound to the abdomen.
looks like something sliced right through him. Debris inside. We need to get in there.
book an o. r. - right away.
Reilly, talk to me.
Reilly can't talk right now, okay, buddy?
he has got a tube in his throat to help him breathe.
Reilly, i'm right here, all right?
put more pressure on that.
lean in there. Pack it. Pack it.
we were gonna be late, so i ran it.
funny, right?
we didn't want to get in trouble with mom.
so i go back to school.
I'm picking him up after band practice.
we're halfway home, he forgets his stupid saxophone.
200. clear.
he forgets everything!
300
everything! Everything!
clear.
continue compressions.
push one of epi and one of atropine.
I know it was stupid.
the guardrail had just come down, and i thought we could make it.
it's my fault.
please.
please.
he-- he's my little brother.
he's--he's little.
th're working on him, okay? I just need you to take it easy. All right? Take it easy.
he's gonna be all right, right?
time of death--20: 48.
Dr. Hunt, we need to intubate him and get him to the o. r. now.
another scotch? - Yeah.
uh, hey... If every drink is on the house, then eventually, there'll be no house.
right. Uh,$6. - it's actually $8.
you having fun?
I am.
good.
that's good.
thank you.
his pain is getting worse.
his color looks bad.
his vitals haven't stabilized. I've seen gas, Dr. Grey.
this isn't gas.
we have to give the medicine a little time to work.
we gave it time to work.
it didn't work... Which means this is not gas.
I've worked the night shift.
I know what goes on.
I've lived through horror stories of patients falling through the cracks because residents are running around half asleep, and their attendings are nowhere to be found.
I will not let that happen to my son.
I won't either. I promise. And i agree that it's not gas.
so let's run some tests and find out what's going on. Okay?
thank you.
it's gonna be okay.
okay, here you go, you guys.
to the groom! To the groom!
it's rude to ditch out on your own party, you know?
yang is bartending. Do you know how disturbing that is?
it's a phase. She's gonna be fine.
besides, you won one of the most prestigious grants out there.
this night's about you not yang.
suit yourself.
one, two, three. Groom! Groom!
how are we letting this happen? I mean, seriously, how are we just okay with it?
Oh, i'm not okay. I'm jealous.
Cristina gets to live out the 20s we never got to 'cause we were stuck in med school.
watch, ten years from now, we'll all have a midlife crisis and end up doing the same thing.
except we'll be in our 40s and won't look as cute.
how many of those have you had?
Hey, my son is with his father.
I am 24 hours child-free.
if cristina yang can tend bar 'cause she wants to, then i can drink 'cause i want to.
has she mentioned me?
what?
I know she writes to you, so i'm asking you if she's mentioned me.
well, you know, she's been very, um...
she's, uh, she just sort of dove right into the medicine, and she's been--she's been busy and just, uh...
does that help at all?
I can't believe this. I honest-- i can't believe that i am here again.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're not doing this. You're not going down this rabbit hole.
I have to start all over. All over.
I don't even know how to do that.
I do.
you might need a little sexual palate cleanser.
a palate cleanser?
are you serious? - What? It works.
sexual sorbet?
I like it.
you see that redhead back there?
she's been eyeing you all night.
Really?
okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you, mark.
all right. I'm gonna, um, i'm gonna go for it.
Oh, no.
wish me luck.
all right, liver hemorrhage is under control.
let's move on.
Oh, there's another one. Nope, two.
what is that?
part of the steering column, maybe. Might have shattered inside the abdomen.
there's an infrarenal hematoma.
all right. We should expose the retroperitoneum.
good idea. - I'll get the aorta below the mesocolon.
slow down, avery. We need proximal control first.
you keep looking for this kid's dashboard, and i'll take care of that.
can i get some more light in here, please?
Dr. Hunt?
his parents are here. They're asking for an update.
Avery. - I'm staying.
I'd--i'd--i'd like to stay.
Grey, tell 'em where we're at.
okay.
what are you doing in the attendings' lounge?
you could get in trouble.
pizza?
I have stupid teenage patients who superglued themselves together so their parents can't tear them apart.
that sounds romantic.
Yeah. More like moronic.
I have no idea how to get them apart without taking off half their skin.
try acetone. - Try going away.
Meredith, any ideas?
acetone? - Thank you.
so what's the deal with stark?
he's a lazy, a backstabbing weasel. Why?
because i called him in to examine this patient-- you called him in?
I wish i coulda seen that. You don't call stark.
well, my kid just had pectus excavatum surgery, and he was in serious pain.
yesterday my fundoplication patient was vomiting.
you don't call stark.
well, this kid's mother is a nurse at seattle pres.
let's play a game. There's one rule.
you don't call stark.
Alex, i'm serious. Normally i would handle this myself.
but i haven't been on peds in a while, and you know the complications with these kids.
did you order blood work and a c. t?
I'd add an l. d.h.a c. r.p. and a sed rate.
I mean, with stark, you have to cover all your bases so if you do end up calling him, he has no excuse but to get off his ass and come in.
thank you.
well, turns out, she was eyeing my new haircut and not me.
I gave her the hairdresser's number, though, so...
well, you tried.
you put yourself out there.
that's what counts.
uh, yeah, no. Actually, that counts for nothin'.
cause i put myself out there every day.
you know, i write online profiles, and i check the boxes that say i like hiking and dogs
is there a box for fistulas?
cause that's what i want-- a guy that can talk fistulas.
I want a guy that can direct me towards a better scientific understanding of just why a fistula may occur in patients that are healthy one minute and die the next.
find a man that's interested in fistulas and pancreaseses, and you'll find a man that's not internet dating.
what's wrong with you?
you didn't call stark again, did you?
no. I'm not calling him until i get my c. t. results, and there's only one c. t. tech down there, and he's really backed up, so...
have i mentioned that i hate the night shift and i hate stark?
Hey, chi. What are you doing here? It's late.
well, when a screaming mother calls me at home to tell me my residents are about to kill her son, time becomes irrelevant, wouldn't you say?
Dr. Grey, are you familiar with mrs. Mcneil?
she called you? I did not give her your number.
she's a nurse.
she worked the system.
but what concerns me is not how she got my number.
it's why she felt the need to call me in the first place.
now what the hell is going on?
I have a plan in place.
I'm just waiting for a c. t.and the guy is just very backed up down there.
how long have you been waiting?
two hours.
get up.
excuse me? - Get on your feet.
now i understand you're a little behind schedule.
Yeah. It's just me tonight, so we're backed up.
well, why didn't you call the on-call tech?
well, he wasn't feeling so hot. I thought i'd cut him a break.
he does the same for me.
listen... Hawk.
we're in the business of saving lives.
now i don't care if your friend is lying in a ditch bleeding, he will come in tonight.
now get him on the phone. Now.
give me that.
hello.
no, this is not your dude.
this is chief webber.
what do i need?
I need you to get yourself into this hospital in the next five minutes, or you and your dude can kiss your jobs good-bye!
now that's how you get things done at night.
I just left lucas in surgery.
he's critical.
it's very touch and go at this point.
but we're still working, and, um, we'll keep you updated on his condition.
thank you. - Okay, thanks.
okay, i'll let you know.
and reilly?
our other son--reilly? How's reilly?
H-has anyone talked to you?
no. We've been waiting.
okay. Um... Okay.
Mr. And mrs. Nash, i'm, uh, i'm--i'm afraid
no. No!
I'm sorry to say that... - Please don't say that. Reilly!
please don't say that. Please don't say that. - Despite our best efforts to save reilly's life...
Reilly! Not my baby! No, no, no! God, no! No! No!
his injuries were too severe...
and he died in the emergency room. - Oh, my god!
I'm so sorry.
No! No. Oh, my god!
Oh, please tell me he's gonna live.
the parents didn't even know the brother died.
not to mention how he's gonna feel when he finds out.
how do you live with yourself-- shut up!
just shut up. Please.
Avery. - Sorry. Sorry.
I just-- thiss a really tricky part right here.
there's something... What is this?
all right, more suction and some laps in here.
is that a piece of the turn signal?
come on.
it's right next to the aorta.
I can't tell if it's-- if it's kissing it or if it's--it's perfed.
give me some umbilical tape, and let's pull it so we can get some control.
all right. Okay, pulling.
pulling.
all right.
wait, wait, wait. Don't. Don't, don't.
damn it!
clamp. Give me the clamp. - Avery, i'll do this.
no, give me the clamp. Give me the clamp.
here. Take this.
got it.
I've got the bleeder. I've got the bleeder right here.
nice work.
nice work, avery.
so this won't sting, but as the skin starts to separate, you may feel some pain.
I feel nothing but pain right now.
me, too.
Oh, it's your mother, lauren.
this is just gonna take a few more minutes, right?
hopefully.
is it working?
God, i can't look.
please.
if we could just stay together one more day
well, you'll definitely be together for another hour, because this...
is not working.
Yes!
Oh, Dr. Bailey. Yes.
Dr. Bailey.
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm not here. You don't see me.
I just need a nap before i go home, but first i need some food.
uh, this will just take a second. I've got these 2 15 year olds.
they superglued themselves together.
uh, they're in love or whatever they think they are.
anyway, i-i tried, uh, petroleum and acetone to separate them, but
don't separate them.
what?
young people need love, too, kepner.
we all need love.
if the world had more love, we could get rid of wars and fistulas.
why won't this damn thing take my money?
Dr. Bailey, are you drunk?
tipsy.
a-a little tipsy.
right.
um, you know, i'm gonna go ahead and take care of that for you.
Yeah.
Hey, Dr. Altman.
are you available for a consult? I'm just waiting on some c. t. results.
Oh, well, joe took my keys, so i'm--i'm pretty sure...
I shouldn't be practicing medicine.
well, what are you doing here then?
well, i'm killing time until joe gives me my keys back.
can't you do that at the bar?
Cristina yang is bartending, so, no, i can't.
it's just-- it's too depressing.
Cristina's bartending as, what, some kind of joke or-- as some kind of bartender.
Yeah, i know. That look on your face?
that's how my whole body feels, and not just 'cause cristina makes the world's strongest drink, but because my aspirational couple has broken up, anthey're living on two separate continents, and 'cause i'm dating men who still live with their mother.
but they don't admit that on their profiles.
they wait until i've spent an hour applying my makeup and driving crosstown, and then they tell me that small ltle detail.
thank you.
and my star student, my most promising resident that i have ever seen, is mixing irish car bombs for a bachelor party over at joe's bar.
I'm not even gonna mention that she's letting the bachelors feel her up at will, 'cause that just adds insult to injury.
crap. I'm--i'm really drunk.
pictures are up.
all i'm saying is that that redhead missed out.
if joe's were a lesbi bar, you'd have been up to your ears in
please don't say vagina.
well, now i don't have to.
God. I hate being drunk.
you think it's gonna make you feel awesome and happy, but it just makes you feel tired and gross.
well, yang looked like she was having fun tonight.
what, the crazy party girl thing?
that's crap.
every girl who climbs up on a table thinks she's the hottest girl in the room, but...
you okay? - Yeah.
I just... I need to sleep.
I need to sleep.
all right.
Oh, yeah.
drew's got a perforated ulcer.
and cristina's working at joe's.
what? - Forget it.
it's bleeding, and it must be from the anti-inflammatories.
wait. Wh-what about cristina?
she's a bartender now.
I called stark in and no answer.
well, big surprise.
this kid needs surgery.
I know.
Mrs. Mcneil. This is alex karev. He'll be consulting on your son's case.
the c. t. scan revealed that your son has a perforated ulcer.
that's what's causing his pain.
so does he need surgery? - Yes.
and we've called dr. Stark, and he's on his way.
we can start prepping him immediately.
thank you. Thank you.
okay, so hold on.
are we really gonna call in a whole o. r. team without an attending?
I mean, what if stark doesn't swer the page?
what if he doesn't come in on time?
what if the kid dies while we're waiting to find out?
look, i'm taking this kid to the o. r. whether stark comes or not.
like the chief said. This is how you get things done at night.
what if we have to do a truncal vagatomy or a pyloroplasty?
have you ever done those on your own? - Not only can i do it.
I can do it better than stark.
are you in or out?
well, like hell if i'm gonna let you do it without me.
is he talking? Yeah. He's under.
no word from stark yet?
no. - Call him every five minutes until he answers.
and page dr. Bailey.
Bailey's not on call tonight. - Just keep calling her.
I thought you said you could do this better than stark.
shut up.
10-blade.
it's the o. r.
uh, h-hello. Uh, D-Dr. Bailey's phone.
no, she is, um, she's indisposed... At the moment.
could you p-page someone else? Thank you.
okay, good.
that's good. Now give me my phone.
I need to call ben.
who's ben?
my ex.
I dumped him, which i now realize was a big mistake, so i want to call him.
I want to call him and tell him i have needs, 'cause he understood how to take care of my needs in a way my husband did not.
I want to tell him that.
so give me my phone.
ARE--ARE--ARE you sure about that?
give me-- 'cause, you know, uh, drunk dialing never really ends well.
I-- you are a virgin.
word really does travel around here.
I'm bailey. I know everything.
Kep--come here, kepner.
come. Closer. Closer.
Alex karev is not the boy you want to take your maiden voyage with.
Oh, god. Oh, god.
Yes, i know. I am aware.
uh, you don't need to tell me.
you take your maiden voyage...
with a nice boy, a kind boy, a boy who loves you, a boy that y love so much, you wanna superglue yourself to him.
you wait.
you hear me? Keep your... Knees together.
cause believe me, even though you haven't met your ben yet...
you will meet your ben.
not my ben, but your own ben...
who might or might not be called ben.
use soap and warm water.
on... My maiden voyage?
on the superglue.
Oh, yeah. - Use soap, water, and put a little acetone in.
it works like a charm.
okay. Yes, ma'am.
thank you.
salt! Salt! Come on. Here we go.
Yeah!
you want some more water?
come on. You got it.
you know, you could fire her for drinking on the job.
are you kidding me? I did that three hours ago.
take her home.
can't. Not until she wants to go.
why not?
because she's got a lot of people telling her what to do, and she doesn't need to hear it from me.
so what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna sit here and drink water, make sure she doesn't leave with anybody.
Really?
that--that's your whole plan?
well, if she's gonna act like a stripper...
I'm gonna act like a bouncer.
Oh, god.
dictate the op notes and monitor his a. b.g. s i'm gonna rack out.
I gotta be back here in-- god--two hours.
I got it. Go.
all right.
good work, avery.
go talk to the parents.
give them... The good news, okay?
okay.
you can, um, you can talk to me, you know, if you want to talk.
about what?
I hear you every night.
you know, i-i'm just saying, i had sleep problems, and they turned out to be real problems.
Yeah. Well, i don't have any problems.
that kid was practically dead when he got here, and i pulled half of his car out of him, so he lived.
he's gonna live to be stupid another day because of me.
those parents aren't gonna lose everything because of me.
I call that a pretty great night.
so what is your problem?
any word from stark?
no.
here's the perf.
anterior duodenum.
well, we could do a graham patch.
excellent suggestion, fellow surgeon.
2-0 silk, please, boki.
can you believe we called an entire o. r.team and they came?
amazing. - We've got balls. Clamp.
I was just thirsty. I didn't wake you, did i?
Oh, no. No, i was, um... Awake.
water?
I want, um...
sorbet.
sweet tooth?
I think i have some cookies around here somewhere.
Really? - really.
okay. I told them about the surgery and his recovery process.
do you think i should mention his high chance for infection or...
I don't know. I don't want to worry them any more than i have to.
no, just... Tell them he's gonna feel pretty awful that he lived and his brother died...
that every time he feels glad to be alive...
he'll hate himself for it.
just tell them to look out for that.
he won't want to talk about it, but...
he'll be glad they know.
all right.
all right.
under the cover of darkness...
people do things they'd never do under the harsh glare of day...
Yeah. Nice.
it's not as bad as it looks. It looks pretty bad.
Yeah.
Hey, thank you for calling. I appreciate you staying, shepherd.
good night.
Oh, my god. It's my boyfriend.
husband. I'm your husband.
right. - Sorry, dude. She's all your come on.
come. Come on. - Yep.
all right.
good night.
Oh, good!
you're awake.
indoor voice, please. - Of course.
um, you know... I really appreciate you opening up to me.
I mean, you always have that, like, super-serious Dr. Bailey face on.
I coul't even tell if you liked me, but now, i mean, well, i-i don't know if i'd say that we're friends exactly, but, i mean, sort of. I mean, don't you think?
Dr. Kepner.
Yeah.
this... Never happened.
this... Never...appened. Got it?
say the words.
this... - Never happened.
never happened.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
decisions feel wiser...
people feel bolder.
what can stark do?
I mean, we had to operate.
he can yell. He will yell.
it doesn't matter. You know, the kid's in good shape, the mom's happy.
we did what we were trained to do.
remember the first day? The chief said only two of us would make it.
I thought it would be me and cristina.
how are we the last two standing?
I am gonna make your lives a living hell.
and you know what?
I'm gonna enjoy it.
you lied to my patients.
you hijacked an o. r. you preformed a surgery that you had no possible business performing, and for the life of me, i-i-i don't know what you were thinking.
medicine has a hierarchy for a reason.
if there had been a complication, you know whose ass would've been on the line here?
mine! Not yours. Mine!
you doctors in this residency, you think you can do whatever you want, whenever you want.
I've got some news for you.
I am the attending! You are the resident...
but when the sun rises...
you have to take responsibility for what you did in the dark...
I had to use soap and water.
what?
the acetone didn't work on the superglue till i mixed it with soap and water.
I could use a little soap and water right now. I feel disgusting.
I can smell you from up here.
dibs on the shower.
I want a beer. Who's up for a beer?
where are you gonna get a beer at 6: 00 a. m?
at home.
and face yourself under the cold, harsh light of day.
water? - Oh, no.
good morning. - Good night.
one of the hardest lessons as a doctor is learning to prioritize.
truck.
cabin.
spoon.
truck.
cabin.
spoon.
very good.
we're trained to do all we can to save life and limb.
but if cutting of a limb means saving a life, we learn to do it without hesitation.
several months ago, I asked you to remember three words.
can you tell me what they were?
truck.
cabin.
spoon.
the three words I asked you to remember, what were they?
it's not an easy lesson to learn, -and it always comes down to one question... - Yes.
um... What are the stakes?
truck.
cabin?
and the third word?
what do we stand to gain or lose?
at the end of the day, we're just gamblers trying not to bet the farm.
spoon. - Spoon.
spoon.
excellent.
chief. You paged?
Hey. - How's it going?
well, the word "spoon" has ceased to have any meaning for me, but I'm through the first test set.
I have a few more consults today, but what's up?
Meredith... I would like to initiate a clinical trial.
one that would be the next major advancement in the fight to cure type 1 diabetes.
and I'd like you to participate.
but I am on derek's alzheimer's trial, so I don't think I I can do both.
just listen.
the basis of this trial was something that I found in here.
in my mother's journals? - Yes.
she was working on islet cell transplantation when s became ill, trying to eliminate the need for anti-rejection meds altogether.
with her notes, drugs, and new technology, there's no way we can't take this the rest of the way down the field.
we?
well, it's your mother's work.
I wouldn't feel right moving forward if you weren't a part of it.
you shou look at them both.
just think about it.
it's your decision.
it's your birthright, Meredith. It's your mother's legacy to you.
what is it? - It's a kale and apple juice smoothie.
it's time to think less about your cravings and more about filling that baby with nutrients, which that has.
it also has chunks.
I don't drink chunks. I want my coffee.
mark, tell the woman.
I'm allowed to drink one cup of regular coffee.
sure you are.- Oh, w-wait, Mark.
that goo looks great. I say you stick with the goo.
okay, you two can't just dictate what I'm allowed to eat and drink.
nobody's dictating anything.
but you're pregnant now, so things have to be different.
you're gonna have to eat better and take it easier at work.
and well, if it helps, we'll give up caffeine, too.
that helps no one.
well, how about we put it to a vote?
all in favor of callie drinking coffee, raise your hand.
all in favor of the goo.
goo it is.
it's horrible. It's the opposite of horrible.
alzheimer's or diabetes?
if you continue to whine about how you can't decide which groundbreaking medical advancement to put your name on, i'll punch you in the ear.
well, my name's already on one of them, according to the chief.
I mean, diabetes - affects 240 million people worldwide.
and alzheimer's - is the seventh leading cause of death.
it's "sophie's choice.
it's "sophie's choice.
I've never seen that movie.
Oh, you should. It's really funny.
Greys, okay, how long has your father been having abdominal pain?
abdominal pain? - It sounds like abdominal pain.
thatcher Grey is not an easy man to get information from.
our-our father's here in the hospital?
Yeah, I admitted him an hour ago. You didn't know he was coming?
well, what-what-what's wrong? Could it be related to the liver transplant?
of course. He's rejecting it because it's my liver.
okay, look, just do me a favor, go take a blood sample, and try to get some more information out of him.
I I need someone who speaks Grey. - Yeah.
Hey, stranger.
Meredith has two groundbreaking clinical trials, and I don't have any.
okay, but you have a husband that loves you. - Yeah, so does she.
then... Then I guess you're screwed hello ，Nicu.
I thought I knew all the nurses on this floor.
how did I miss you? - I guess i'm just lucky that way.
I'm Alex Karev. - Neat.
and you are? - Not telling you my name.
any reckon why not?
because, uh, I don't want to.
okay.
then how about you pass me one of those charts?
I hear there's a turnip in the cabbage patch.
a turnip?- Gorked. Brain-dead.
Dr. Robbins and I have a baby with a hypoplastic left heart.
the transplant coordinator - Suggested the, uh, turnip as a potential donor.
Yeah.
well, now you do get to know my name.
I'm Dr. Lucy Fields.
I deliverd that gorked baby. So, uh, thanks for the heads-up.
I'll talk to the transplant coordinator. But now you need to leave.
come on. There's no reason to overreact.
Really?
well, now you're barred from the Nicu. How's that for overreacting?
you can't do that.
want to find out?
Oh, what do we have here? - You really don't want to know.
let me get that for you, Dr. Torres.
okay, Randy Shshouse, 23.
multiple injuries after slamming into a brick wall.
H how did you - Idiot and his idiot buddies built a human slingshot.
I wasn't supposed to hit the wall.
I was supposed to fly over the house and la-land in the pool.
but why would you do that?
so they could film it, put it on the internet, and show the world just how stupid they actually are.
dude.
did you get that?
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.
but why? - Because it's hilarious, that's why.
okay, Randy, that must have been some kind of awesome slingshoto, because it looks like you've dislocated both hips.
now I'm gonna need to get some x-rays.
I'm on it!
she's perky. - Better than stupid with a death wish.
you're sick enough that you need to come into the hospital, and you don't even call me?
the pain comes and goes. I didn't want to worry
so you thought that you would just sneak in and just quietly reject meredith's liver, not even make a fuss?
just c-calm down, please.- Oh, no. I am calm.
I am so calm. I'm like the calmest one.
okay, good.
because there's something else that I should have told you.
I go to A. A. A couple times a week.
Yes, that I know.
and say that they like what you said, and then maybe you go to coffee with them afterward.
Yeah, like a sponsor? - No, not a sponsor.
Oh, how do I - Oh, there you are.
sorry. I got turned around, and then I ended up back in the lobby.
Hey. N - no, no. No, no, no, no.
Oh, god. What? I'm sorry. Are-are you in pain?
uh, yeah.
not a sponsor.
I am so sorry. This was not the way that I wanted to meet you.
well, I didn't even know there was a you to meet.
I know. I-i'm sorry. I
okay, Mr. Grey- Oh, hello.
Dr. Bailey, this is... Danielle.
Dani. Hi. - Yes, Dani.
that's my father's girlfriend, whom I've just met just now.
Oh, I see. Um, nice to meet you, Dani.
I just have a few questions, and then I will let you get back to all of this.
do you really think I could be rejecting this liver?
because Dani has been amazing helping me take care of myself.
and I'm constantly taking pills.
his anti-rejection meds. Not, like, speed or anything.
cause that would be inappropriate.
um, when did the pain start? - 12 days ago.
Sh-She's good with details.
any fevers or changes in your urine or stool?
no fevers. But there was a...
pain incident, uh, last week, thursday.
a - actually, you might not want to hear this part.
I'm a doctor.
all right.
well, we were being intimate...
and I was on top - Oh, oh, okay.
go on.
Dr. Avery.
it's about time I had you on my service. - Thank you, Dr. Sloan.
I gotta say, I really think I have the hands for plastics.
Oh, forget about your hands. Look at those cheekbones.
sir? - You're genetically blessed.
don't think I haven't noticed.
and speaking from personal experience,
I can say that that will only help you in plastics.
that face? Better than a hundred billboards, my man.
all right, Dr. Sloan, I really don't feel comfortable being judged or praised based on my looks.
Oh, poor Mr. Green eyes.
let's not pretend being beautiful's a burden.
now come on. Mrs Johnson's ne isn't gonna fix itself.
how about a little sparkle?
there it is.
okay. Should we just, uh, go ahead and reduce those hips?
Kepner, I need you to speak differently.
I'm sorry?- It's your voice. It's a little
just speak dferently.
like with an accent or - Never mind.
you know, how about you get me a muffin from the cafeteria?
get me the sugariest kind you can find, and some coffee.
wait. No.
damn it. No o coffee.
okay. - No. You know what? Yes.
coffee. Please. - Great.
crap! No.
n-n-no coffee.
you sure? - No, no coffee.
just... Just-just go.
okay.
uh, did you still want the muffin? - Yes.
Okokay, yes, I know that I'm not Dr. Bailey, but he's my father, and I really need his lab results.
sorry, I can't do it.
okay, well, then maybe I'll just let your supervisor know that I've been highly unsatisfied with your service today.
this isn't the mall. We don't have comment cards.
well, maybe you should.
Hey. You o okay? You need me to talk to him?
mark, no.
my day has been too messed up to have you in it, too.
son of a bitch we know without a doubt that this heart is a viable option.
how? How do we know that this is a good match?
well, babies under a a year hahaven't developed an immune system that will reject the new organ.
it makes matching a lot easier.
but we're still four weeks away from the due date.
our O. B.Isn't even in town right now.
I'm covering for Dr. Napolitano.
I've got her blessing to go ahead and do the c-section today.
today?
t-that's really- Colin, time's an issue here.
we need to inform the transplant board as soon as possible if you want this heart.
otherwise, it's gonna go to another family.
okay. You know what?
there are a lot of doctors in the room right now.
so why don't we give the Cookes some space?
you can have one of the nurses page us when you've made a decision.
what's going on? Why didn't you page me?
turnip, karev?
you tattled on me? - You're so off this case.
Seriously? I have said way worse stuff than that.
Yeah, not helping.
are you kidding me?
Avery, you want to give the osteotomies a shot?
Yes, Sir.
mallet, please.
you live with Lexie Grey now, right?
how's she doing these days?
okay, I guess. - Okay?
she hasn't seemed upset?
she kind of cries sometimes, but she seems okay.
now are you gonna strip the, uh, lateral cartilage here?
crying seems fine?
she's a girl. Girls cry.
but you don't know what she's been upset about?
not really any of my business.
Yeah. - What's next?
next, I finish up here while you go find out what's up with lexie.
sorry? - She's upset.
you're gonna find out why. You want to be on my service, then serve.
use that Avery sparkle.
Dr. Sloan - I'm gonna do a couple more rhinoplasties this afternoon.
you do me this is solid, and I just might be persuaded to let you take the lead on one.
okay.
Oh, yeah.
what are you doing?
I looked it up, and those, uh, caffeine studies showed birth defects in rats, and I'm not a rat, so... Tell her I'm not a rat.
well, let her have - Hey, we took a vote.
Yeah, well, I have to fix multiple fractures, Arizona.
that's major surgery. Okay?
so that totally changes the situation, completely.
and Mark's not here, so it's your vote against mine.
I need caffeine.
okay, you want caffeine that badly, calliope, fine.
you're a grown-up.
you can make your own decisions.
that's right. So... ?
damn it. Damn it! That is s not fair.
you're not fair.
for someone who has a history of ambivalence towards motherhood, you got the whole guilt thing down cold.
I am entitled to an opinion.
I mean, I've been left out of too much of the conversation already, and I sure as hell did not choose Mark Sloan to be the father.
so if I'm gonna do this, then you know what?
I'm gonna have a voice.
Oh, god. That's good.
holy crap. Your mom was sma.
truck.
cabin. Spoon.
3- for-3.
crap. This is so good.
is it better than this?'Cause seriously, mer, you'd have to have died of alzheimer's to fail this.
I don't even know if I'm doing it yet.
you have to. Mother-daughter surgeons cure leading killer?
I mean, I'm still jealous, and I'm doing a heart transplant on a baby that hasn't even been born yet.
will you shut up about that?
you're the one who needs to keep his mouth shut, cabbage patch.
screw this. I've been on this case for a month.
I'm not just gonna sit here.
Meredith, you have to come see dad.
Oh, does he want more organs?
he wouldn't say. He was too busy loving up on a tattooed 20 year old.
is that upsetting you?
you wanna talk about it?
no.
no worries.
I have a surgery to get to.
Meredith. - I can't deal with my dad. I'm too busy with my mom.
Mer, let's go.
they're not engaged.
are you sure?
Meredith, please.
fine.
you're doing great, Sarah.
I didn't hear her cry. - Her lungs were junky.
we had to intubate. - She she deteriorated fast.
I'll call for an x-ray and an ultrasound.
already ordered it. - Well, what's her PH?
you'll need an A. B.G. - Karev, we got it.
Yeah, Dr. Robbins, she's my patient.
not anymore.
you got something for me, Avery? - I do, actually.
uh, her dad's here.
he might be rejecting his liver, and he brought his 20-year-old girlfriend.
Yeah, that'll do it.
Lexie's probably going crazy.
Meredith's no help when it comes to their father.
I'm not gonna be lead surgeon on a rhinoplasty, am I?
she just needs someone to talk to.
we are not close. That is not something we do.
peanut butter cups. - What?
you get her eating, you get her talking.
she loves peanut butter cups. - That's's ridiculous.
tomorrow, I'm doing a series of cleft palate surgeries for the nightingales foundation pro bono.
of someone who's in the running for chief resident.
might?
get some results... We'll talk.
get in there. - And do what?
well, make it stop. - There's no way she's 20.
she's gotta be like 26, 27.
I'm 27.
gross.
uh, tiny baby heart time.
careful when you go in there, Mer.
you tangle with one hells angel, you tangle with the whole gang.
okay.
you coming? - I'm not going in there again.
seriously, lexie? - I can't.
well, then I'm going back to work. - Meredith
all right. Hey, uh, ove, please.
I'm gonna page Bailey.
this is what happened last time.
all right, dad, is it the same pain? Where-where does it hurt?
I'm telling you, I have seen this before.
okay, well, I'm sorry. Will you please let him talk?
he can't talk. - No, it's here.
all right, all right. Just back up, please. - Baby, it's gonna be okay.
okay? I'm right here. - I'm sorry. Back up.
I need to do something. Please just tell me what I can do.
okay, back the hell up right now!
Oh, god. - All right. All right, dad.
the blood tests indicate that your liver is fine.
is there anything at all that you've left out?
it's when he pees.
uh, just now and then last thursday, we had mexican food, and he drank all this water because it was spicy, and he went to the bathroom as soon as we got home.
I was freaked out when he screamed later during the sex, I didn't even connect it.
uh, all right, all right. Good. That helps.
so what-what do you think it could be?
well, that - It could be kidney stones or your prostate.
prostate? Are you saying he could have cancer? He - He can't have cancer.
that's what happens when your boyfriend's an old man.
old men get cancer. - Lexie, come on.
no, but see, if you were a doctor like we are, you'd realize that when we use the word "prostate,"
it doesn't necessarily mean cancer.- Dr. Grey
no, see, freaking out and jumping to conclusions like a little child - isn't gonna do him any good. - I am scared, okay?
I am terrified over here, and I've got questions.
you're terrified? We're his family.
I am his family, too!
no, you're not his family! You're his midlife crisis!
that's enough. You're out of line.
no, y-fine.
uh, cancer is-is one of a hundred things it could be.
Dr. Bailey will run some more tes just to rule it out.
it's far more likely there's another explanation for this.
are you the daughter that gave him the liver?
I am.
thank you.
you're gonna be fine - say it again for the camera.
no. No, I don't think I will.
Kepner, talk to the camera so we can get to the O.R.
in my normal voice? Or
Randy has multiple fractures.
the most pressing problems are his hip dislocations.
so we are going to reduce them as soon as possible before they loose blood flow.
reduce? - Uh, pop 'em back into place.
Oh, man.
hold on. Let me, uh, let me get up on this chair for the wide angle.
uh, yeah. We're not gonna - we're not gonna do it here.
he has to be sedated, and we have to fix his femur, so we're just gonna do everything in the O. R.
wait. What if we did the hips here, you know, while I'm awake?
and then I can give the thumbs-up to the camera.
well, it's for the art, Dr. Torres.
you know what?
that is a great idea.
Dr. Hunt, I think that it's... - Dr. Torres, it is for the art.
okay.
Marcus, hop on that chair. Kepnerspot him.
all right. Sure.
okay.
you guys ready?
okay.
please stop! Stop!
turn the camera off! Stop!
turn the camera off!
Marcus, turn the camera off!
that totally cheered me up.
well, art has that effect.
listen... I'm sorry about the turnip thing.
I shouldn't have said it.
but doctor to doctor, you overreacted.
that's my patient.
I deserve to be in there.
you deserve it?
you know, I have a patient, too.
you want to know what happened to my patient?
look, I'm sure it's ugh
she had a 40-hour labor, and then the baby was stuck on an angle, wouldn't drop.
so my patient just had to push... And push and push.
and you want to know what you say to a woman who's in that kind of pain?
you say,"one more," Jackie.
one more, and you're gonna see that baby.
one more, and you're gonna have a beautifuful baby boy.
I know it hurts.
I know it does.But give me one more, Jackie, and you get a baby.
that's how you get a woman to tear her own body apart. You promise her a baby..
you make a promise, and she hurts herself because she trusts you.
and then... When the baby comes out and he's not, uh...
he's not... You're the one that's gotta telher that you were... Mistaken.
makes me kind of lose interest in what you deserve...
Mr. Wherere's the cabbage patch.
dad's got a kidney stone.
Dr. Bailey's taking him up to the O. R. Now.
Oh, she didn't just give him a strainer? It's gotta be huge.
Yeah, well, he deserves it.
you know, I never really got it before, but this is how he operates.
he'll go off, marry Dani stops the tattooed lady, yes.
have six little midlife crisis babies, and I'll never hear from him again.
it's exactly what he did to you.
it is not exactly what he did to me.
of course it is.
Lexie, my mother had an affair, and then took his kid across the country.
your mother died, and he was miserable, and he started drinking, and he destroyed his liver.
this isn't about you.
he found someone who makes him happy.
just give them your blessing.
let him be happy.
what are you talking about?
don't defend him. You hate him. Hate him with me.
Lexie, I love you, but you have to grow up.
got a strong heartbeat. I think she likes her new heart.
of course she does. It's delightful.
all right. Let's take off the clamp, Dr. Yang.
why is her blood pressure so low?
there's a very low arterial pressure wave.
all right, let's, uh, let's check it.
maybe there's a kink in the art line somewhe.
damn it.
turn up the flow.
that aorta needs a long diagonal anastomosis.
well, that'll take at least 45 minutes.
well, we don't have that. We've gotta do it in 30, otherwise we're gonna lose her.
scalpel.
clamp it.
start the clock.
son of a bitch.
I hate this. I hate this.
what time do you have, Yang?
27 minutes.
okay. I'm ready.
clamp off.
we got this.
Robbins, Altman, they got this.
yeah? Then why do you look sick?
Prpressure wave's coming ba.
systolic's 57.
Oh, that's it. Yes.
Yes! - Yes!
chief, I'm, uh, I'm with a patient.
did you get a chance to look over the materials?
I did. It's amazing.
well, the next step is getting the funding in place, and I can make two phone calls and have that by midweek.
uh, sso you're waiting for... - Uh, you.
you have to sign on as co-investigator so we can start moving forward.
chief, it's an amazing offer.
it's not an offer, Meredith.
I can't offer something that doesn't belong to me.
it was your mother's work, and it's only right that you continue it.
I, um... So you think that I owe it to her?
honestly?
I think she owes it to you.
she didn't give you a lot of love, but she gave you her talent and her name... And this.
this gift could change the course of your career.
I... Have to get back inside.
Meredith... It might change the way you think about her.
it could be the greatest thing the both of you ever did.
how did it get to this?
how did four seconds of internet fame become worth breaking yourself into a million pieces?
he did it because he thinks it's funny.
that's bull. You don't just put yourself at that kind of risk.
well, it's his decision.
his decision?
idiots like this shouldn't be allowed to make any...
it is his body, okay?
and you dot get to say what he can and can't do with it.
he is a person.
he getto make his own damn choices.
I am going through the worst caffeine withdrawal of my life because someone thinks that being pregnant means I'm no longer of sound freakin' mind!
you're pregnant? - Shut up!
I'm not endangering my baby.
I just-I just want one damn cup of coffee!
okay. Kepner, go get dr. Torres a cup of coffee.
okay.
run.
thank you. -Congratulations.
Oh, whatever. Just come around here and help me with his hip.
all right. One...Two, three.
she doesn't seem so bad.
candy?
screw you and your candy.
she's terrible.
all right.
ever notice how my sister's a jerk?
I, um - yeah,"give them your blessing."
what a bunch of crap.
you know,"let him be happy"?
what about me, you know?
everybody's making these huge life decisions, and they're not even considering how it will affect me, how I'll feel, you know?
I'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives, and yet they're leaving me out of the conversation completely.
you know, starting up new families and springing it on me when it's already a done deal.
you know,hey, lexie.
guess what.
I found a tatted-up skank to be your new mommy.
Remember,"spoon"?
I don't know why we're here.
why are we here?
it's such a little word.
can we go home now?
okay, mom. Okay.
he's gonna be sore for a while.
you'll need to make sure he drinks plenty of water.
Dr. Grey.
is he okay?
he's fine.
will you please just make sure that he calls me?
Yes, of course.
thank you.
I'm almost five years sober.
we support each other, and... I'm good for him.
and he is really, really good for me.
is that a hooker on your shoulder?
I was drunk.
okay.
there he is.
how you feeling, buddy?
can't straighten it out any more than that.
Ah, there's his surgeon.
you're the man, Dr. Hunt. How'd he do?
okay, Randy, since there was a tear in your joint capsule, we needed to open up the hip to reduce it.
we put a rod and screws into the other femur to fix that and reduced the other hip.
and this piece of hardware is keeping your wrist fracture together.
that's intense.
is that, like, some sort of record or something?
like the worst case you've ever seen?
um, no.
the worst case I ever saw was a guy who had an exact fix in his arm like this one, but he also had a gaping hole with exposed bone that needed to be covered.
he also had a matching hole that, uh, ripped through his back and tore his stomach apart.
needed 11 surgeries to reconstruct his abdomen.
he survived all that?
no.
no, he didn't.
but, you know, come to think of it, your situation, it is actually worse.
how?
well, that guy-he threw himself in front of a grenade to save six other soldiers.
he didn't launch himself into a brick wall so the internet could laugh at him.
turn the camera off, Marcus.
chief.
you know, I had forgotten this about your mother.
she wrote everything down.
she didn't have a thought or a fragment of a thought that didn't get scribbled in some journal. She was compulsive.
lucky for you that she did.
lucky for both of us.
no, for you.
you knew the woman who wrote them.
that's why I gave them to you.
I was happy to read them and to understand her better, but the woman I knew was different.
but I am starting toto realize how scared she must have been.
that had to be why she was writing everything down.
she must have been so scared.
Meredith, I... - So please, go ahead.
I think it's right that you continue her work.
but I really just want to cure her disease.
good night, chief.
good night.
so... What's your plan?
sleep.
my plan for tonight is sleep.
I was gonna hit Joe's before heading home.
you wanna come?
I just need to crash.
no, I get that.
maybe tomorrow.
for sure.
sorry about your patient.
Thanks.
I'm happy for yours.
Hey, you want to get a... - no.
right.
we made dinner... For you.
what is it?
um, grilled chicken breast and some brown rice and broccoli... And-is that coffee?
Yes, it is.
and here's the thing - I get that things are gonna be different now.
and, uh, that's why i'm gonna eat that chicken even though the only thing I want right now is a peanut butter sandwich.
great. I'm really happy
Oh, I'm not done.
if we're gonna do this whole "everybody gets a vote" thing, there's gonna be a new system.
we'll still each get one vote, but also, the baby gets a vote.
as I house the baby, I'll be speaking for him/her.
and since I'll be pushing this baby out of a very small hole in my body, i'll also get an extra-special vagina vote.
so that's, uh, three votes for us, two votes for you guys.
Oh, we get the final say.
now I'll be using my many votes to say that once a day, I will have one cup of regular coffee, which is perfectly fine according to the studies that I've read, at least until I begin breaeast-feeding.
now anybody want to argue with my extra-special vagina vote?
no. - No, thank you.
great.
Oh, we also vote that Mark gives me a foot rub.
I'll go get the lotion.
okay, well, I guess that a peanut butter sandwich is doable if you eat the broccoli.
deal.
surgery is a high-stakes game.
did you decide?
I did.
I choose you.
I'm glad.
I've been going over the data you collected today.
and so far, it is 100% consistent with the pretrial phase.
which means what?
it means that it's not not working.
that's great news.
you want to know what else is great news? - What?
the kids are not gonna be home for another 20 minutes.
but no matter how high the stakes, sooner or later, you're just gonna have to go with your gut.
and maybe, just maybe...
how much can you actually accomplish in an hour?
run an errand maybe?
sit in traffic?
get an oil change?
when you think about it, an hour isn't very long.
60 minutes.
3, 600 seconds.
that's it.
in medicine, though, an hour is often everything.
we call it the golden hour.
that magical window of te that can determine whether r a patient lives... Or dies.
thank you, doctor.
are you gonna help me at all or are you just gonna sit there and eat potato chips?
I performed four back-to-back fem-pop bypasses today.
this is the first chair I've seen since 7: 00 a. m. and this is the first food I've had since yesterday.
I choose potato chips.
you might want to get that.
Seattle grace mercy west emergency.
you brought this on yourself, you know?
you volunteered to help run the e. r?
got it.
Sadomasocochisc chief resident candidate maybe.
what is up with you?
you're all perky and cheerful.
Ah, you know, it's the, uh, fertility drugs.
we have stepped it up. I'm pumped full of hormones.
you know what's perky?
Quol?
my boobs. They're huge.
am I supposed to like big boobs?
Oh, god, no.
they'll make you fall over.
so, um... Callie mentioned a thing.
or it might not be a thing.
at least I hope it doesn't become a thing.
Hey, I got a patient with a headache better after sumatriptan.
he's ready to be discharged. Just need you to sign off.
is he neurologically intact?
you did a c. t? - I did. It was negative.
the most interesting thing about this guy is that he came into the e. r.
for a glorified migraine with a girlfriend from hell.
Ooh, which one is she?
just point with your eyes.
here. Thank you.
so, um, callie had a thing. What kind of a thing?
Grey, you paged?
Yeah, we have a suspected appy on a 10 year old two minutes out.
an unexpected thing.
Grey, call up. Tell 'em to get an o. r.Ready.
I already did. O.r. Five is prepped and ready for you.
Callie asked me to be her baby's godmother.
well, you said no to that?
you gotta say no to that.
E. k.g. Results. - Thank you.
the guys at work overreacted and insisted I come to the e. r.
Sweetitie, I had a big lunch.
it hardly qualifies as chest pain.
no, what I need are some antacids. I'll be there. I promise.
just tell max to put on his jersey. Okay? I'll be outta here soon.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be your doctor today.
Oliver richter. Sorry about the phone.
I'm supposed to be picking up my son for the huskies game right now.
I'm sure he'll understand.
you don't know my son.
there are very few things more important to him than basketball.
big fan, huh?
I'm just gonna take a quick listen.
the biggest 9-year-old fan you've ever seen.
okay.
so it says here that you've been experiencing some chest pain.
when did that start?
uh, an hour ago, maybe two?
but I'm already feeling much better.
and you wouldn't just be saying that to get discharged faster?
look, I got my son tickets to this game for his birthday.
he's been marking off the days on his calendar for weeks.
I can't be the reason he misses it.
okay. Well, your e. k.g. Looks normal, and your heart sounds good, but if there's one thing we don't take lightly around here, it's chest pain, so...
could we go back and just pretend I said heartburn?
would that get me out any faster?
no, probably not.
but tyler is going to do a portable chest x-ray.
and we're gonna do a chest pain workup, and we will try to make it as quick as possible.
Thanks, Dr. Grey, so much. Thanks.
so... This is gonna be a thing.
why am I telling callie no again?
um, while you're here, I need a second opinion on this e. k.g.
do you see anything?
no. Looks, uh, normal.
what are you doing here? Thought you had the night off.
Yeah, I do. I'm not here.
what's medical records' extension?
looks like you're here to me, which is good, because we're swamped.
take your pick - Impacted bowel, suspicious rash, or really smelly guy.
or they would suspend my privileges.
you're gettingng suspended?
dibs on his solo splenectomy tomorrow.
I better be able to finish this crap before the game tonight.
told a patient yesterday he didn't have cancer, and he was so happy, he gave me two floor seats.
you took a gift from a patient?
did you tell him you cured his cancer?
uh, colectomy time.
I'm out.
excuse me.
Hi, I-i'm sorry.
to set our son's leg - nathan englundar.
uh, we were told that somd be by it was a while ago. Several hours, actually. And I was
no, I know. You've been here a whwhile. I'm sorry.
the problem is, we just don't have enough o. r.s available for non-emergent cases.
an o. r?Whyhy would you need an o. r?
your piatrician hasn't been by to speak to you yet?
your son has a broken femur, which is a severe break.
it requires a full cast on the broken leg, connected to...
a cast on the other leg to keep everything still so the bones will heal properly.
2 full-leg casts on a 4 year old?
and because your son is so young, we can't set the bones properly without putting him under.
under meaning anesthesia?
and that requires an o. r.
I'm sorry.
I know you've been waiting a long time.
as soon as an o. r.Opens up, I'll let you know.
thank you. - Okay.
the losers in medical records aren't answering.
are you sure you can't stay and help out with some of this stuff?
floor seats.
I understandwhat you a.
I know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital.
but I am not a medical professional who would ever consider
maybe you should consider it.
Eli lloyd... Do not test me.
maybe you should consider the potential benefits.
all the intensely exciting, toe-curling potential... Benefits.
Dr. Bailey.
okay, uh, this is gonna be for a prescription-strength migraine medicine.
just don't take it with alcohol. - Okay.
we're missing our anniversary dinner because you have a headache.
a headache.
do you know how hard it is to get reservations at this place?
I'm sorry, gia. I am. But t it really hur.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'll be - Oh, Mrs. Webber.
Hi, dear. How are you? - I'm fine. How are you?
does the chief know you're here?
Oh, please don't bother him.
I had a little fall is all.
got home from work, slipped off the stepladder- ohh- Landed on my wrist.
Oh, it's basasically nothing.
well, it's not nothing.
well, I-I brought lots of magazines and a good novel.
I am perfectly fine waiting until you make time for me.
I know you have far more pressing patients.
well, you're the chief's wife, so that makes you my most pressing patient.
look, stew-man. They opened the doors right for us.
are you sure about that?
but I can't believe you wouldn't let me drive, dude.
dude, you're drunker than I am.
I can't believe you tried to stiff the cabbie.
wow, it is bright in here.
Hey, could somebody do something about this?
you're a little early.
I thought our date was at 6: 30.
well, I'm herere now because a guy just walked into the pit with a knife sticking out of his head.
sweet. I mean, pooruy.
is he stable?
he's neurologically intact, but
well, I need to check on him sooner than later, so, avery, take him down to c. t.
stay with him until I get there.
all right. Will do.
okay, so you'll be down to see knife guy when you're done?
I will.
and then we'll have our date?
wouldn't miss it.
0. 00451388888888889
how did this guy get a knife in his head?
Oh, apparently there was a brawl at a tailgate party.
so you know how stupid guys get-dr. Bailey.
uh, I'm taking a nap.
uh, I'm sorry.
what I-I mean to say is, i'm going to use this room to take a nap, because that's what people do in these rooms when they're tired, 'cause I-I have a child and a full-time job, and work long hours, so I'm just tired, just very... Ve tired.
okay. - Okay.
I - I was just gonna ask you, had you seen Dr. Altman?
d - no, I have not seen Dr. Altman nor any other doctors or nurses, because I will be in this room asleep, by myself.
actually, I see her now. Dr. Altman.
Dr. Altman, do you have time for a quick consult?
I was supposed to be off by 6: 00, but - Oh, okay, sure.
just walk with me.
okay, so... - Oh, damn it. He's early.
um... All right, just, uh, g grey, give me a second.
Hi, uh, william.
it's, uh, it's nice to see you.
you look amazing.
so official.
I mean, I-I knew you were a doctor, but you... Are a doctor.
Thanks. Sorry, I didn't-I didn't have time to change. I'm just
no, no, no. The scrubs are ststrangely sexy.
Thanks. Um, you know, I have a few things to wrap up.
do you mind hanging out for a few minutes?
like, uh, ten tops?
Yeah, no problem. Take your time. I'll just, uh, grab a seat here.
Hey, stranger.
I didn't, uh, I didn't - I didn't know that you were, uh, you were here today.
Yeah, they w wanted to run a blood glucose test on me, so they gave me this nasty orange kool-aid to drink.
in about an hour, I gotta go give 'em some blood or pee.
and we don't really need to talk about my bodily fluids.
sorry to be rude.
Oh, sorry. Um, yeah. Um, william, uh, henry.
Henry, william.
are you, uh, are you a patient of teddy's?
something like that.
anyway, i,um, I-I gotta go.
uh, but I'll be back soon.
promise.
all right, grey, wh do you got?
okay, 42-year-old male, um, complaining of midsternal chest pain.
no cardiac risk factors, no angina.
pain doesn't radiate.
the e. k.g. Looks clean.
these are his films, and they're mostly clear.
but I don't know. Does the mediastinum look a little wide to you?
because I know, sometimes that can happen with the portable x-ray.
you got cardiac enzymes?
Yes.
how good are you at forging signatures?
even if I were good at forging signatures, I wouldn't do it.
it's unethical and probably illegal.
so I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own.
I'll check on Mr. Richter right now.
call radiology.
get him in for p. a.And lateral films, and tell 'em to rush it, cause I'd really like to get outta here and go on my date.
I mean, did you see that guy?
no forging snatures, karev.
Radioly, please.
forgery, huh? Why am I not surprised?
whatever. I just want to get outta here so I can get to this game tonight.
wait. You have tickets? Tonight? It's the pac-10 title game.
Yeah, I know.
win this, and the huskies get an automatic bid to march madness.
why do you think I'm powering through all these stupid charts?
Hey, what are yoyou d - What are you doing?
of my ten patients in labor right now, none of 'em are past 3 centimeters, which means, I have some time to kill, and you can't miss this game.
hand me a pen.
I thought you thought I waa loser.
well, you're a little less losery, now I know you like college hoops.
Hey, where's the knife guy?
is it true he's walking and talking?
what about your coh? - postponed.
the wife snuck him a cheesebuburgrger and fries before surgery.
so this thing with callie - I mean, you know it's a bad idea, right?
you don't want to be callie's baby's godmother.
I don't?
no.
I mean, think of how many people have to die before you even get to step up
that's a lot of people.
it is, yes.
a lot of dead people.
right.
whereas if you're my baby's godmother-in-waiting, it's only me and derek.
one wrong turn down a dark, twisty road, boom, you're in.
okay, let's be clear.
if I am ever a godparent to anyone's kid, it will be in name only.
I will not be taking care of children.
that's what boarding schools are for.
which way to butcher block?
trauma 2.
I understand you might be thirsty, but I'm sorry.
you cannot drink beer in here.
you're wasting it!
Oliver, did you see Dr. Altman?
Yeah, she's sending me off for another x-ray.
look, I know you guys have to cover all your bases, but
no, I know. I'm sorry. But I put a rush on the x-ray, so hopefully it'll be quick, okay?
excuse me.
I was finishing a surgery just now when a scrub nurse asked me how my wife was feeling, because she'd heard adele was in the e. r.and I hadn't.
now would you like to explain to me why I found out my wife was a patient in this hospital from my scrub nurs and not from you?
Richard, hush.
let meredith do her job.
she hasn't even had a chance to examine me yet.
is that true?
don't mind him, dear. He's just worried about me.
he gets gruff when he's worried.
I hurt my wrist.
I was trying to get out the holiday decorations and I-ohh-I slipped off the stepladder.
Oh, it was stupid.
I should've waited for richard to get home.
he's so much taller than me.
I requested an x-ray and an ortho consult.
I will call and make sure that they're coming down.
don't touch that!
I'd better go, see what that is.
you better.
is everything all right?
Yes. - no!
I was just showing these guys how, when I scrunch up my eyebrows, the knife move see?
Oh, my god! my god!
stop moving the knife! - Okay, okay.
you guys shoulda seen the brawl.
stew-ball kicked that other guy's ass!
okay, and now stew-ball has a knife in his head.
okay, let's focus. Stewart, how much is 14 plus 4?
27 minus 13.
15? -No.
172 minus 60.
I have no idea, but it's not because of the knife.
it's just 'cause I'm so drunk.
no, actually, it's just 'cause he's dumb.
Thanks, david. Really?
unbelievable.
his mental status is completely intact, if you don't count for his math skills.
it's like the knife didid no damage at all.
so why don't you just pull the thing out?
cause we got a games to gets to!
I'll drinks to that!
No! No beer!
buzzkill.
how many do you have?
okay.
Oliver's in x-ray, stewart is stable and waiting for derek, who should be here soon, adele is waiting on ortho, and, uh, c can I gt the discharges from the last hour, please?
Oh, and, uh, the boy in bed seven with the broken leg, nathan englundar
let's check on the status of the o. r.For him, please.
is this lexie's patient with the headache?
how long ago was he discharged?
not long. A few minutes ago. - Did he leave?
did he already leaveve?
Mr. Turner!
Mr. Turner, I need you to try to smsmile for me, pleas.
who the hell are you?
I need you to try to smile for me, please.
okay, can you lift your arms above your head like this?
Dr. Grey, is everything all right?
no, it's not. We got a code c. v.a. Let's get stretcher out here, stat.
can you repeat after me?
the dog chased after the cat.
The-t dog ch-chased af
what's going on? What's happening to him?
what's happening to him?!
we need to get him on the ground.
okay, get your purse under his head. Quickly, please.
okay. And help me secure his arm. Hold it like this.
o- o-okay, but wh-why are we doing this?
bebecause he's having a stroke.
unsteady gait, slurred speech, asymmetric smile.
his symptoms started no more than 20 minutes ago, so we should be well within the golden hour.
okay.
I know-a stroke, right in front of me.
I mean, what if he had been driving me in the car when it happened?
Oh, wait. Hang on. Here's the doctor.
so the stroke team has taken him up to c. t.
we're gonna see if he's eligible for the clot-busting medicine.
we caught the stroke early, which is v very good.
so-so on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being I might have to cancel our aspen trip in a week, how is he?
you should cancel the trip.
you will not believe this.
looks like the blade landed in the maxillary sinus.
chances are, the knife itself is tamponading any major bleeding.
probably best just to go ahead and open up the cranium.
or we could just take him to the o. r.And pull this thing out.
really, avery? Just pull it out?
let me guess.
you want to get out of here early to go to the game, just like everyone else.
or since it looks like the blade didn't hit any major arteries or veins, he knows that a controlled extraction would be both safer and less invasive than a complete craniotomy.
is that true, avery?
is that why you suggested we pull it out of his head?
and I want to get outta here early to get to the game.
me, too. I'm good with that. Let's just do what he said.
Lexie, I need to speak with you.
thank you for getting me out of that room.
I swear, it takes everything just to be civil to mark lately.
such an ass. What's up?
take a look at this. Look closely. What do you see?
this is the patient's admitting signature when he came in.
and this is his signature when he was discharged.
Oh, no.
Mitch turner, the patient you just discharged, is up in radiology being treated for a stroke.
Oh, god.
I know you know the signs of a stroke.
how did you miss this?
are you distracted by the mark thing? Is that it?
no, I checked the c. t.He was having a classic migraine.
he's had them before.
there's no way that he was having a stroke when I treated him.
Lexie, I know you know, this kind of headache can be a precursor to a stroke.
when you said you needed an ortho consult, you coulda mentioned it was the chief's wife, grey.
I would've been down here a hell of a lot sooner.
I am so sorry to keep you waiting, Mrs. Webber.
you hurt your wrist in a fall?
Oh, it was so silly.
I'd just gotten home, and I was trying to get some
reach something on the top shelf myself.
I - I just landed wrong.
her wrist absorbed all the impact.
Yeah, it looks painful.
we'll get you some more pain meds to help you out with that.
uh, your x - ray shows a hairline fracture.
so it could have been a lot worse.
we'll splint you up and get you out of here in no time, okay?
you have me paged if you need anything, okay?
okay.
thank you for covering for me before with the chief.
you didn't have to do that.
excuse me?
when you said I hadn't been by to examine you yet.
so you said that you fell when you got home... From work.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
do you remember hitting your head when you fell?
not that I recall.
Dr. Grey, I have the new x-rays for oliver richter.
okay. Let's get mrs. Webber a head c. t.
okay.
Oh, damn it.
excuse me.
sorry to make you wait.
no, no problem.
um, really. Henry here has been keeping me company.
although he's probably si of me by now.
I've been grilling him about the major leagues.
you didn't mention he used to play pro ball.
Oh... I didn't know that he did.
it's not a big deal, really.
although there is a baseball card out there with my face on it somewhere.
look, I don't mean to hold you guys up.
you probably have a - a reservation waiting.
excuse me, Dr. Altman.
Mr. Richter - Mediastinum looks borderline on the p. a.Films. Take a look.
okay, um... That reservation may have to wait just a-a little bit longer.
I'm sorry.
I mean, if you want to reschedule, I totally
no. Nonsense. I'm-i'm happy to wait. You are saving lives.
least I can do is take you out to dinner when you're done.
thank you.
did you-you ever pitch against jeff bagwell?
once, and it wasn't pretty.
you were right. Get a c. t.To be safe, and I'll stick around to look at the results.
at least somebody's having a good night.
good news?
or not such good news?
Oliver, your second x-ray is still concerning.
Dr. Altman and I agree that you should have a c. t. just to rule out anything serious.
and how-how long will that take?
Oh, that's my son calling.
he's worried we'll miss tip-off. What should I tell him?
do I need to tell him we're gonna miss this game?
I wish I had an answer for you, but I think it's a safe bet you'll be late.
Max. Hey, buddy.
how's my little man doing?
Oh, daddy will be fine.
don't you worry. Don't worry.
you just worry about all that popcorn we're gonna be eating.
make sure he's on broaoad spectrum antibiotics. You booked an o. r?
it didn't hit any brain matter at all?
doesn't look like it from this.
how long till shepherd gets down here to take a look?
he should be out of surgery any minute.
good.
longer that thing stays in there, the higher the risk of infection Or abscess formation.
so now can we get outta here?
how is he, grey?
pupils are equal and reactive.
he's alert and awake.
can I get some more gauze for this wound, please?
reflexes seem normal.
give me that.
I'm fine. It's just a little headache is all.
I've had hangovers worse than this.
what's the status on the bla?
well, about that... - yeah, there is no blade anymore.
what, uh, what happened? Sir, just lay back and let me examine you, okay?
could we just get a doctor, please?
I want to take a look at the c. t.s.
it's gonna be okay, nathan. - He's really hurting.
okay, I'm gonna write an order for more pain meds.
it's okay, monkey.
I know you want to go home.
it'll just be a little while longer, okay?
it will just be a little longer, right?
Tyler, where is the o. r.For nathan?
I haven't heard back yet.
okay, well, let's call them again, and let's call the ortho team and make sure they're ready to go, okay?
weWe will get to nathan as soon as possible. I promise.
how's he doing?
well, the blade went through his skull, didn't hit any major nerves or arteries, so he's gonna be fine.
flesh wound?
I mean, that's the luckiest guy alive.
you're also pretty lucky, too.
it's past 6: 30, and we haven't had our date yet.
I'm swamped. I can't leave.
I have one patient in c. t.another one waiting for an o. r.
well, your patient's c. t.Isn't ready yet.
no. And the o. r.You're waiting for isn't either.
so okay.
I mean, maybe I do right at this precise moment have one minute, but it's a minute.
that's perfect. That's all I need is a minute. I need a minute.
what!
Oh, sorry. - what?!
no one. It was nothing. That room is occupied.
uh, just never ask me what I might have seen or might not have seen in there.
okay, well, if we can't go in there, where are we gonna go?
I have an idea.
where are we going? - Nowhere. We're gonna do it here.
wait. No we're not.
come on. - No! No way!
are you kidding me?
no. Drop your pants.
come on. I'll be quick. I'll be in and out.
Oh, my god.
eyes up here! Seriously. Are you kidding me?
I'm serious about this. Where is your sense of adventure?
my sense of adventure is down on the first floor.
it's not in this elevator.
come on.
if not for me, then do it for your future baby.
come on. Turn around.
I cannot believe I am doing this.
this future imaginary baby of ours better be worth it.
okay. Here we go.
Oh, there it is.
there. I told you I'd be quick.
I can't wait to meet our future fictitious baby.
me either.
we got through those charts fast.
floor seats, here I come.
so I just helped you get through three dozen charts in a fraction of the time it would have taken you to do on your own, basically ensuring you get to your floor seats on time.
how long do I have to wait till you ask me to go to the game with you?
I... I-I mean, I was supposed to take avery, but screw him.
sure. You-you want to go?
no. I'm on call tonight, actually.
I just wanted to seeee if I could get you to ask me out.
excuse me.
just admit it. You like her. - Shut up.
God, I don't think you do understand, actually.
this has been going on since yesterday.
we took our son to an after-hours clinic where he was misdiagnosed, and then he was sent home without so much as a painkiller, and he was up all night crying.
and then this morning, our pediatrician sent us here.
and now we'v've been waiting around all day... With our 4 year old son.
believe me.
I understand that a kid with a broken leg doesn't take precedence over a guy with a knife in his head, but my son is scared and he is in pain, so could somebody please just get to his leg already?
please. - Yes, sir.
you still haven't helped that kid yet?
he's 4 w with a femur fracture. You know how much that hurts?
no, I know. It's jusust bn one of those days.
Tyler, isn't that o. r.Ready yet?
they're prepping it now.
Grey, my wife was cleared by Dr. Torres.
you ordered a head c. t.For a broken wrist?
Yeah, I can explain that sir. I have some concerns
Dr. Grey, they're calling from c. t.Your patient's coding in the scanner.
what? - They say he's coding.
hold c. p.r. V - fib.
page Altman.
give me the paddles now.
charge to 200.
clear.
Chcharge to 300.
clear.
got a pulse. - yes!
scans are up. - Grey, talk to me.
uh, he was coding when I got here.
I defibrillated him three times.
I gave him three rounds of epi, two of atropine.
I loaded him up with amiodarone, but he's tachycardic now.
I mean, he's barely hanging on.
he needs surgery. Book an o. r. - Okay.
I'll get a room prepped and ready. - No time.
his aorta's dissecting as we speak.
he needs surgery right now.
they're saying all the o. r.s are booked.
well, tell 'em to bump someone,'cause we're come up either way.
I have an o. r.Tell 'em to bump mine and prep it for an emergency cardio.
all right. Here we go. Got it.
go.
let's hold that elevator!
come on.
once these doors open, we're gonna have to get him in the o. r.
and open him as soon as possible.
I know.
even then, if that aorta tears, we may already be too lalate.
and we're not gonna have time to scrub.
I know.
Thanks.
just pour the betadine straight on to the chest.
it doesn't need to be pretty. We need to get in there.
plug me in.
scalpel.
cautery.
cauterizing now.
get in there quickly, grey. Time is myocardium.
all right. Saw.
get that retractor ready.
this guy thought he had a bad case of heartburn.
he went from that to this in less than 45 minutes.
that's how these work.
how's his pressure? - 70s and dropping.
retractor.
every beat of his heart rips this tear a little bit wider.
all right.
how many of thesese ruptured dissections have you caught in time to operate?
40. Maybe 50.
how many have you been able to save?
three.
all right. I'm in.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
he's bleeding out.
his aorta is wide open.
all right, clamp. Come on!
here.
all right, grey. Let's try sucker bypass.
cannulas.
it's not working. There's too much blood.
all right. Well, once we get him on bypass, it'll be easier to control.
heart's fibrillating.
all right. Cardiac massage.
paddles.
I've almost got him cannulated.
charge to 10.
clear.
damn it.
he's bleeding out of his nose and ears.
I've been loading him up with blood, f.f. p.And faor vii, but I can't keep up with the losses.
Foley's full of blood, too.
he's d. i.c. His cannula sites are oozing.
let's push 3 of epi. Set me up for another shock.
clear.
damn it.
well, what can we do? Just tell me what to do?
there's nothing. His aorta is in shreds.
well, what about... - there is nothing left to do.
call it.
call it, grey.
no, I mean, we... - Grey, we got here too late.
these are almost impossible to catch.
there is nothing that we can do. I'm sorry. We need to call it.
time of death - 1852.
I heard you lost a patient.
you know, it's not that I don't want to share you.
I mean, I don't want to share you, but that's not the reason I don't want you to be callie's baby's godmother.
okay.
it just seems like, if you agree to be callie's baby's godmother, you're saying that I'll never have a baby of my own.
Meredith, you know, I- I'm in no way saying anything that-that
I know. It just feels that way.
okay.
okay.
well, i,uh... Have to go have really uncomfortable conversation with callie now.
how about you? What are you up to?
Oh, I have to contact oliver's family.
Oh, hey, hey, hey, wait.
you got, uh... Blood or something.
thank you.
you're welcome.
Hey, chief.
about earlier... - It's all taken care of.
I checked adele's head c. t.Myself.
it was clean.
her wrist is in a splint.
and I'm taking her home now.
well, I still have some concerns.
and if her c. t.Was clean, then I have even more concerns.
thank you, meredith, but I assure you, adele is fine.
chief, she's been getting things very confused.
Meredith, she is fine, and I'm taking her home right now.
why was she getting christmas decorations down in february?
good night, meredith.
and she said she had just gotten home from work.
didn't she retire?
Meredith... - Chief, something isn't right.
okay, that's enough.
now I know what you're implying.
and while I appreciate your concern, that's enough.
Adele had a scare today.
she had a fall.
any number of things could account for her mixing up a couple of details, not the least of which is her being interrogated by you.
now if something bigger were wrong with my wife, I would know it.
you've got alzheimer's on the brain.
I mean, you-you buy a car and you start seeing it everywhere you look.
now you've been working on this alzheimer's trial 24/7.
I get it.
but adele is not your mother, meredith.
she's my wife.
now good night.
I'm so sorry.
I got pulled into an emergency surgery.
where is nathan?
actually, a-a doctor came by to get him a little bit ago.
he's getting his casts put on right now.
great.
that't's great new.
drDr. Grey, we have a surgical abdomen in bed three.
okay, let's just get oliver richter's chart.
okay.
hello.
Hi, max.
this is - No, it's your daddy's doctor.
is your mom around?
an hour... One hour...
can change everything... Forever.
well, we'll have to keep you overnight for observation, but your prognosis is very good.
great.
so maybe we don't have to cancel our aspen trip after all.
I just had a stroke.
I know.
and you're worried about our travel plans?
well... It's a nonrefundable trip.
cancel the trip.
you know what? In fact, cancel all our trips.
how have I put up with you for two years?
I'm done with this.
we're done.
get outta here.
now, before you give me another stroke.
W - wait, wait.
can I see your keys?
okay.
now you can go.
an hour can save your life.
so before he gets off the phone and since I now have to go pee in a cup, uh,
I just have to say this
I basically spent the past hour on a first date with william myself.
and I don't know how m much you know about the guy, but this is what I know - Um, he wears driving gloves.
Yeah, and he doesn't live with his mother, but until recently he lived above her house, and he used the word "shant," and he wasn't being funny, and he has yet to tell me a story about himself in which he is not the hero.
so as, uh, as your husband... I think we can do better.
good news.
not only was I able to push the reservation, but I also got us a a table by the window.
black truffle gnocchi awaits.
ready?
ready.
an hour can change your mind.
so when's your next break?
okay. No.
this... will never happen again at work.
understood?
sure.
okay.
until your next break.
sometimes an hour is just a gift we give ourselves.
all right, stewart, you're choosing to leave against medical advice, so you're free to go, but this is my number.
now if you experience any of the nrological symptoms on this sheet, you call me, all right?
somebody should stay with you tonight and have plenty of fluids - Not beer.
not beer.
will do, doc.
Thanks, doc.
for some, an hour can mean almost nothing.
I can't believe he walked in with a knife in his head and is walalking out an hour lar to go to a ball game.
speaking of which... Any chance you want to go to the game, too?
apparently karev didn't want his floor seats.
so you interested?
actually, yes.
Yes, I am.
for others... An hour makes all the difference in the world.
now, nathan, when you wake up, you're gonna have two big casts on your legs.
but that's a good thing, because it means it's gonna make your lebetter, okay?
but right now, I have a very important question for you, and that is, what is your favorite color?
blue.
blue it is, then.
let's prep the blue casting material, please.
all right, I'm gonna take this mask, nathan, and I'm gonna lower it...
but in the end...
it's still just an hour...
one of many... Many more to come.
60 minutes... 3, 600 seconds... That's it.
and it starts all over again.
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey.
I'll be your doctor today.
it says here you've been experiencing some abdominal pain.
when did that start?
and who knows what the next hour mightold?
there's nothing else we can do for you.
these are the last words a surgeon wants to tell a patient.
eight surgeons have said this is inoperable.
I mean, even the tumor board at Cleveland clinic.
well, I can see why.
giving up doesn't come easy to us, so we do everything in our power not to.
catch.
what's this for?
heads, we do it. Tails, we don't.
you're insane.
it's a gut check. I get a feeling when it's in the air, what I want it to land on.
flip it.
for surgeons,"lost cause" just means "try a little harder."
Oh, damn it. I screwed it up.
gag Zola, really?
those aren't G's. Those are Y's for "yay." "Yay Zola."
see, a normal person would've just written "Happy Birthday."
well, I couldn't fit all those letters on the cake.
okay, who used up the last of my deodorant?
Oh, that might have been me.
sorry.
kinda had a workout last night.
not mine.
coffee.
fresh out, chief.
wait. N-no. That's impossible.
I just bought some three days ago.
you're out of O. J.too.
Hey, you're still here?
Oh, yeah. I was on my way out, and then I saw these cheeks.
so cute.
we don't touch the baby because we don't know where those hands have been.
Alex, does.
okay, so, um, I have a meeting with Owen, so I'm off.
party is at 8: 00. Don't be late.
I got 20 minutes before work. You wanna, you know?
Yeah. - Good.
come on.
round two.
Oh, we need to move.
do we?
okay, take a look.
I took a little more off this time.
no, I love it. Hey, look.
I want that. Move.
Oh, I've got surgery in an hour, so we'll do you tomorrow.
and you I will see tonight at Zola's party.
yes?
love you.
see ya.
see ya?
Yeah."I love you, too" is the appropriate response to "I love you."
Yeah. - Why wouldn't you...
we've been dating three months. It's way too early for that.
Oh, no.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
this is classic Mark.
he found out Lexie and Jackson broke up, and now he's suddenly getting cold feet about Julia.
you and Lexie are over, okay?
that ship has sailed...
and sank.
this has nothing to do with Lexie.
okay, I'm gonna take Sofia to day care.
come here, honey. Hello. Yes, my little baby girl.
I love you. Bye. - I love you, too.
morning, Dr. Webber. - Morning.
Dr. Webber. - How are you?
Dr. Bailey.
congratulations, sir.
big day today.
Yes, it is, but...
but I don't want everybody making a big deal out of it.
we won't.
good. I-I-I mean, you'll...you'll do something?
Yes.- I-I mean, it is my 10, 000th surgery.
that's a lot of surgeries.
I've reserved the main conference room.
there will be a photographer from the hospital newsletter.
the cake is your favorite...
red velvet and cream cheese.
Yes. - It is huge...the size of four cakes.
there will be several speeches from admiring colleagues and a toast with sparkling cider.
we will also hang a banner that says "congratulations, Dr. Webber on your 10, 000th surgery!!!"
there will be three exclamation points after the word surgery.
we also have confetti.
happy now? - Yes.
Oh, e-except for the confetti.
might get in the cake.
Oh, take a seat, Grey.
okay, so I know I haven't logged a lot of O. R.time lately, but I've been getting a routine down with Zola, and I've got it under control now, so I'm all set.
is that it?
you still haven't declared a specialty.
I know.
uh, it's a really big decision, and I have been thinking about it.
you ditched neuro, you wasted time in O. B. you're my only fifth year who doesn't know where they're going.
you're drowning, Grey.
drowning is a strong word.
how about general?
you've been helping Bailey with the diabetes trial, and Webber's always been a mentor, not to mention your mother.
she was one of the best general surgeons this country's ever seen.
with that legacy, you could be a natural.
how did you repair it that fast?
well, it was luck more than anything else.
he could've gone into pulmonary edema.
no, it wasn't luck.
you were in the zone. That was amazing.
Dr. Altman, um...It's lasagna.
and this is a spinach pie.
Oh, that's...
that's so sweet. Thank you.
um... It means a lot to me.
more widow casserole.
your husband's dead. Have some food.
what is that?
you know what? I'll put it with the others.
how'd the surgery go?
I'll see you in the pit.
glad to see she's not mad at me anymore.
she's very busy.
we just did a mitral valve repair without bypass, and she threw, like, 25 stitches in 10 seconds.
I've never seen anything like it.
how long's it been since you slept?
I had a huge nap. Whatever.
I've done, like, 8 surgeries in the past 72 hours.
Teddy's boundless grief is, you know, one of the best things that's ever happened to me.
what is that...is that trauma or administrative crap?
no, none of your business. Go home and get some sleep.
Oh, trauma.
no, Cristina...
take that.
I was paged here. I already ordered the C. T.
he's my patient.
this isn't finders keepers.
I'm taking over the patient.
what do we got?
back off, Yang. I met the ambulance.
everyone, take a breath. What happened?
a 32 year old ran his bike into a wrought iron fence.
Yeah, and this is the fence going directly into his heart.
I know how to deal with these injuries.
he's my patient.
I can remove it thoracoscopically.
Yeah, and that's when the poor guy dies because if you do that, you won't have a direct visual.
plenty of people use the vats technique to remove impaled objects.
Oh, now you're the expert?
you don't get every cardio case, Yang.
enough, all of you.
McQueen is the doctor on call.
he can handle it.
Karev, you will assist.
altman, I believe today is your day off.
go get some rest.
Dr. Altman has way more experience, and this is gonna be a complicated procedure.
well, both of you have been up for the past 48 hours straight.
this is a liability issue.
hands off the patient.
Dr. Altman?
fine.
enjoy your nap.
his neuroblastoma is more complicated than most I've seen.
it's very rare that someone his age...
they're mostly in younger kids, I know.
it's in a very large region of his spine.
there is the very likely risk of paralysis...
from his upper body down. There's also the risk of death, a death that he is gonna meet in three months anyway if you don't do this surgery.
I understand the risks, Dr. Shepherd.
the surgeon in...in Boston compared it to dismantling a bomb with your eyes closed, and the one in Chicago said it was patching a dam with gum.
you're the ninth surgeon I've talked to.
so what I want to know is, are you gonna say anything different, or do I have to take my kid somewhere else?
there is only a 5% chance of success.
maybe a little less.
Yes, if you're willing, I'll try.
okay.
should I go tell WES?
wait. Um... There's something else.
he... he doesn't know about his tumor.
he's 11, a young 11, and knowing that he's very likely gonna die is not something that's gonna do him any good.
wh-why does he think he's here?
a backache. A very bad backache.
Hey, Dr. Bailey. - Hmm?
chief hunt says I need to declare a specialty.
he suggested general.
good for you. Mini Ellis Grey.
no. I'm still on the fence about it because there are a lot of specialties out there...
don't be an idiot.
it's in your genes, Grey. It makes perfect sense.
Oh, uh, Karen and Marcy, I'd like you to meet Dr. Bailey and Dr. Grey.
they'll be performing the liver transplant with me today.
nice to meet you.
this I. V. really hurts.
you think it could be infected?
I mean, I'm already missing my family vacation for this.
I'd... I'd hate to die of staph.
you're not gonna die, Marcy.
I am the one in liver failure.
it doesn't look infected. A little discomfort is normal.
thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.
I've never had a major surgery before.
but when your sister calls you to come and save her life, I mean, you take that call.
how lucky I am to have just that sister.
Yes, you are.
well, the labs look good. We're ready for transplant.
in the meantime, why don't we relax?
relax in a hospital?
it'd be a lot easier on a white, sandy beach.
I'm gonna reimburse you for this trip.
I promise.
I just hope I don't die in there.
I mean, it would be hard to reimburse me for my life.
thank you, Marcy.
I just can't thank you enough.
Oh, well, you're welcome.
fort Ticonderoga is probably my favorite.
it's not giant like Gettysburg or famous like the Alamo.
you feel any pain here, WES?
a little.
still, it was a really important fort.
it changed hands a bunch of times in just a few years.
Benedict Arnold even fought there.
he's got a thing about battlefields.
I see that. Hey, relax.
my mom says I get it from my dad.
he died when I was 2.
we've gone to 18 battlefields in the past year.
we homeschool because of the back pain.
it's so cool.
I wake up, and we get to decide what I do that day.
next week, we're going to Pearl Harbor.
that way, my mom can have a beach vacation, too.
actually, WES, we may be postponing Hawaii.
Dr. Shepherd thinks he might be able to fix your back.
Really? Then I won't have these aches anymore?
well, that's the plan.
what about ortho? Callie would be a great mentor.
bones? - Oncology.
depressing. - Trauma.
I've had enough trauma for one lifetime.
well, just pick something.
this decision is important.
check it.
fence guy...heart's the size of a football.
from hitting a fence?
from being impaled on a fence.
don't worry, Yang.
I'll send you pics from the surgery.
Hey, is it too late for me to pick cardio?
Yes. Cardio's mine.
you don't have to do this, you know? - I want to.
he's the chief of surgery.
and that heart is the size of a football.
Oh, oh, he's leaving.
okay, go.
go now.
Mrs. Vanderburg, I'm Dr. Yang, and I'm...
I'm so sorry to hear about your husband's accident.
are you one of his doctors?
Oh, I'm not, but I'm familiar with his case, and I just wanted to assure you that everyone here is doing everything they can for him.
that's so nice.
I'm sure they've assembled a-a wonderful group of surgeons.
Dr. Altman really is the best there is.
w-wait. No. I don't think they mentioned an Altman.
no, they said something about a Dr. McQueen.
is that right? Is he good, too?
well, he's...he's an experienced surgeon, but he's not the head of the department.
Doctor...Dr. Altman is the head of the department.
you know, I...
with the extent of your husband's injuries, I just...
look, I just assumed she was on the case.
but...I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.
Dr. Altman probably wasn't available anyway.
she's very busy these days...
saving lives.
you swam with the dolphins?
Kaylee swam with the dolphins.
okay, honey.
mommy needs to go save aunt Karen's life now.
Oh, bye-bye, sweetie. I love you, too.
I am risking my life here.
it's not like a ride to the airport.
Oh, believe me, after this, I will never ask you for a ride to the airport.
I will never ask you for anything again.
what is that supposed to mean?
just need a little blood here.
because I am never gonna hear the end of it.
you're gonna lord this stupid piece of liver over me until we're both dead, just like everything else.
one more tube, and I'll be out of your hair.
everything else, like all the checks I sent...
or the jobs I lined up?
you managed to get yourself fired from most of those.
and I have never asked you for anything in return.
Oh, no, just my lips glued to your ass 24/7.
you know what? Keep your damn liver.
Oh, here we go.
you know, I have no job, no husband, no kids. You won, okay?
so just, hey, forget the transplant.
just... you're...
you're off the hook. You're off the hook.
catch your plane to Maui, swim with your precious dolphin...
Karen, what hurts?
don't worry.
when I'm winning the fight, she doesn't feel good.
I'm in liver failure.
classic drama queen.
I need some F. F.P. and octreotide in here!
there's bleeding in the veins at the bottom of your esophagus.
that's a symptom of late-stage liver failure.
you have surgery in a couple of hours.
you have to try not to get worked up between now and then.
I told Dr. Grey, I'm not having the surgery.
I want to go back on the transplant list.
there's no time for that, Karen.
when these symptoms start, we can't wait any longer.
Karen, you're going to die. Don't be stupid.
okay, enough from you.
fine. I'll take her liver.
thank God.
honestly, the things you put our family through.
I'll call Harry and the kids.
they'll be so thrilled you've chosen life.
you got it? - Yeah.
okay.
here you go.
here we go.
did the tumor grow more?
what did you say?
I know what I have.
I overheard some doctors talking about it at the last hospital.
does your mom know that you know?
no. She'd just freak out.
she's your mom. She needs to know.
she cries in the bathroom. She cries at night.
she cries in the morning when she thinks I'm not awake yet.
she cries all the time.
and the only thing that makes her happy is to think that I don't know.
but you can't tell her.
if I'm happy, she's happy.
I promise. I won't tell.
you're not lying?
I'm not lying.
do you think I'm gonna die?
I've worked with Dr. Shepherd for a while now.
and your mom could not have picked a better doctor for you.
he's the best.
well, this one has a patio and a garage, but this one has hardwood floors and a washer/dryer.
you sure you want to move?
uh, Meredith and Derek have a baby, And you're living with your ex.
we're moving. - I'll move.
Zola's killing my game.
every girl I bring home wants a baby the minute they see her.
no.
I'm not living with you. I am trying to get away from you.
all right, then you and me.
you don't want to live with Mary poppins.
no, she cooks, she cleans...
I'm also your friend.
what the hell?
I need food for Zola's party.
I thought I was gonna have time to go to the store, but Richard's 10, 000th surgery is gonna take forever.
you think Teddy's gonna care if I take some of her widow casseroles?
no. Go for it.
you know what? Take this one, too.
it's turkey tetrazzini.
Ooh, yum.
you and, um, McQueen finally find a patient who's willing to let you operate on them?
bite my ass.
Oh, Mer, proctology.
there's your specialty.
explore the mysteries of the butt.
why aren't you just doing general like your mom? It's a no-brainer.
and good marketing.
I mean, when people hear the name "Grey," they know they're getting quality.
no, you can't win Following in the footsteps of a phenom.
said the lame, mediocre grandson of Harper Avery.
Hello, Julia.
what is this?
she's you. You're Julia. Go with it.
you know, I've been thinking, it's been a really great few months, and I just want you to know that I love you.
get out of my relationship.
funny coming from you.
what's your problem? She's smart and pretty and funny and...
and she's not annoying.
come on, it's awesome.
we can all vacation together. We can buy houses next door to each other.
Yay. Yes. - Yeah, and Sofia can have a village.
don't you want your daughter to have a village?
come on. You know you love her.
now you just need to tell her.
who do you love...Julia?
wait. You're here? - I love your hair.
how are you? - Yeah, I'm...I'm good. Thanks.
so what's going on with Julia?
did he just leave because of me?
Oh, no. No, he's just being Mark.
no, no. No, no,'cause you're great. - You know, weird?
all right, sir, are you smiling?
I'm wearing a mask.
I'm not sure it matters.
Oh, yeah. You can see a smile in the eyes.
Oh, for the love of God, take the damn picture.
Yay! Yay! 10, 000! Incredible.
nice work.
all right. Okay. All right, now get out. Get on with your day.
nice job, Dr. Webber.
Kepner, take a look.
uh, it's... sir, it says you're needed in the lobby.
can you tell 'em that I'm in the middle of my 10, 000th surgery?
Oh, you're sure we shouldn't just send an intern...
handle it, Kepner. - Got it.
and that's great, thanks. - Thank you.
Cristina? What are you still doing here?
I'm, uh, gonna watch a surgery.
Derek's, um, tumor thing.
you need sleep.
Yeah, I'm watching neurosurgery. It's a lot like sleeping.
you're not mad that I gave the case to McQueen?
uh, I didn't say that.
and Teddy, she... - Owen...
I know, I know, you don't want to talk about it.
what do I do?
how do I...Get past this with her?
her husband's dead. She's taking it out on you.
you just gotta deal with it.
I know, I know, but I just wish that...
you know what?
never mind. I'm talking to you when I should just try to talk to her.
Well...See you at the party?
Yeah. - Okay.
somebody paged Dr. Webber.
he's in the middle of a transplant.
Yes, over there.
Mrs. Webber? - Where is my husband?
do you know where he is?
I...I live next door to the webbers.
it's 7 miles away.
Oh, God. - Where is he?
I want you to go find him right now!
Yeah, I-I will go find your husband.
would you just stand here, just for one moment, please?
um, could you just stay with her till I can talk to Dr. Webber and figure out what to do?
I can try. She's pretty insistent.
okay, well, uh, I have an office on the third floor.
if you could just...
what? Wait. M...wait. Mrs. Webber?
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, Mrs. Webber, there you are.
um, w...I don't understand.
what's going on?
where are Richard's things?
he...he's gone? He left me?
no. No, no, no. He's just...
he's in surgery right now.
It's...he...It's his 10, 000th surgery.
he's always wanted to leave me for her.
he finally did. - No.
he never loved me. Never!
Oh, God. It was always her.
and now he's gone?
and he just left?
he didn't even tell me where. He's just gone.
I can't do it alone.
and we'll...I can't. I can't do it alone.
please, Richard, don't leave me. Richard, I can't do it alone. I can't.
transect the parenchyma.
watch the aspirator, Grey.
got it.
nice. Nice technique.
well, you've certainly got your mother's hands.
don't get too excited.
I haven't declared anything yet.
well, what else are you gonna do...neuro, cardio?
you want to waste your talent playing with one little predictable organ for the rest of your life?
Nah, I'd rather spend my days leaping from the liver to the pancreas to the stomach to the bowel, and any one could go wrong at anytime.
okay, sure. There's nothing wrong with knowing one organ and knowing it well, just like there's nothing wrong with being fifth-chair viola in the back of the orchestra.
but it's a hell of a lot more fun being the conductor.
now... This...
goes to the chief.
are they ready?
Yeah, but I can give you a few more minutes, though.
no, we're ready.
uh, WES, time to put the computer away.
you... Are gonna be okay.
and the doctors are gonna take really good care of you.
mom, don't cry.
you know me. I cry when you leave for a sleepover.
well, don't. Dr. Shepherd's the best.
you're right, as usual.
give me a hug.
Oh, you're still here.
listen, I know you don't want to talk to me, but this has gone on too long.
now I understand why, at least...
I want to.
we need to talk. Can we just talk?
now is not a good time.
Teddy. - don't!
it's wrapped around more of the vessels than the scan showed.
what do you think, Dr. Grey?
think we should start with, uh, t-4?
Yeah, I,uh, I still think that's the best approach.
there's no clear prevertebral plane.
all right, well, take me through it, step-by-step.
okay, we get up above t-3, maybe t-2, we get control of the aorta proximally, and then dissect the large vessels free.
we preserve the radicular branches as we go, especially Adamkiewicz...
he's paralyzed if we go anywhere near the Adamkiewicz.
we don't get this tumor, this surgery is for nothing.
right. So...we go in far lateral instead?
are you asking me or telling me?
I'm telling. I mean, um, we could mobilize the great vessels, and that way, we get access to the tumor on both sides.
can I get some suction in here?
I've attached the hepatic veins.
now I'm reconstructing the portal vein.
he left me. He left me. I don't want to see him working.
no... - He's always working.
no, no, he didn't leave you. He's right there. See?
Oh, he's with that woman?
you tell that woman to go away.
that's my husband not hers.
Dr. Webber. - Richard, why are you doing this to me, to us?
Adele? - You lied.
you said that you weren't working with her anymore.
Dr. Webber, I-I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.
Ellis! You let him go.
um, Dr. Webber, do you want me to...
no, no, keep the line open.
Adele... That's not Ellis, adele.
what kind of woman would break up a marriage? Huh?
Ellis Grey, what kind of woman are you?
I'm sorry. - Well, I-I should just scrub out.
no, no, I need the extra hands.
I will not have you down there with my husband. Do you hear me?
I will not have it. Richard, you just send her away.
Adele...I'm right here. I'm not leaving you.
Richard! - Tell her something that'll ground her...
a happy memory. - Richard!
a happy memory, it worked for my mom.
my funny Valentine
Richard, you need to come outta there.
you make me smile
your looks Unpho...Unphotographable yet you're my favorite work of art
is your mouth a little weak?
when you open it to speak are you smart?
are you smart?
don't change a hair for me not if you really care for me stay ittle Valentine stay each day is Valentine's day
it's our wedding day.
you were the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
they played my funny Valentine.
because we're getting married on Valentine's Day.
happy Valentine's Day, baby.
I love you.
I love you, too.
tell Bailey to cancel the party.
so once the vertebrectomies are complete, we take the tumor down off the dura, do a myelotomy...
and again hit the Adamkiewicz. Paralyzed, dead in three months.
we resect it free from the aorta... - spinal shock. Dead.
harvest a radicular branch that doesn't have tumor involvement...
dead again. - Okay, stop saying that.
Dr. Grey.
no, we told him that we would try. You're not even trying.
because the surgery will kill him.
we have no choice. We have to close him up.
no.
Dr. Grey, I think it's time you just... no, you're quitting.
okay, it's...it's not right, not when we said that we would try.
there's a 5% chance. We... we owe him...
there is no longer a 5% chance.
Gelfoam, please.
no. He knows about the tumor. He has known all along.
I t...I...I told him that we would try. I told him that you were the best.
now please, Derek, just...Please.
leave the O. R.right now.
all right. Let's close him up.
no party? - Canceled. Help yourself to cake.
Karev, why aren't you still in McQueen's surgery?
Oh, uh, Altman and, uh, Yang took that.
what?
I could be wrong.
you have to tell him. - But I thought he already knew.
no, about the tumor, not that we didn't do the surgery.
his...his mom's not gonna tell him, and he's gonna wake up, and she's gonna tell him that it all went great, and he's gonna go home thinking that we did the surgery, not that he's gonna die in three months. You need to tell him.
she's the parent. It is not our call.
I'm sorry, no.
we can't tell him anything.
that looks more like a heart. Right?
what are you doing? - McQueen wasn't qualified.
I think I was clear in the E. R. - Yeah, I'm head of the department. I made the call.
put another pledgeted suture right here.
right here between these two?
uh, yeah, but closer to the atrium.
you should've informed me. - There wasn't time.
and then I spoke to you, and you...
well, we didn't know that we were doing the surgery then.
I think you're lying to me. Both of you...
you know what? This is a fairly complicated procedure. Can we get into this later?
shall we do an intraoperative echo? - Yes. Why don't you pull it over?
find me when you're finished, doctor.
did you see that throbbing vein...
in his forehead?
I have the hardest time keeping a straight face when it pops up.
the surgery wasn't as hard as they first thought, which is good.
that means we can make it to, uh, to Hawaii now.
you're done. No more surgeries or doctors.
that's it. It's just us.
and we're gonna go on another trip after that, too.
maybe even normandy, like we said. Doesn't that sound fun?
you didn't do it.
what?
you said, after the surgery, I'd be stuck in here for a few weeks.
that's right. I did.
you know, sometimes when we get in there, things change.
that's why you get to go home.
which is a good thing.
Honey...It's all gonna be fine.
you're gonna be okay. Mommy's gonna make sure of it.
and you don't have to worry. I promise.
you're gonna be okay, too.
you don't have to worry about me.
I'm gonna be with dad in heaven.
great. You are the proud new owner of a fully functioning liver.
thank God. - Don't thank God. Thank me.
I'll never be able to wear a two-piece again.
it's a horrible scar.
I have thanked you, Marcy, about a million times.
okay, enough. We're not gonna do this again.
but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
you just don't get it.
so I'm done. - Excuse me?
I am done thanking you.
you are not allowed to mention your extraordinary generosity anymore, except once a year on Thanksgiving.
okay, you're gonna hurt yourself.
and on that night, I will thank you.
but if you don't follow my rules...
Oh, there are rules?
Yes. I will have to bring up everything about you that I have happily chosen to not mention, like how you've lost thousands of dollars in that lipstick selling Ponzi scheme.
that's none of your business.
Oh, and how sometimes, when you're drunk and sad, you "sext" your college boyfriend.
you wouldn't?
Yes, I would, which is why you will not mention my liver ever again.
my liver is dead to you!
fine. Your liver's dead to me.
what about the money you owe me?
enough! Enough! Both of you, stop talking.
she is... - Well, I-I mean it.
so... You are in a time-out, Especially you.
no more talking. - You can't talk to me like this.
this is ridic...
he's still in serious condition, so I'll be staying the night to monitor him.
actually, um, I'll stay with him tonight.
Really? The head of the department?
I'm happy to do it. - Oh, thank you.
I can stay with you. Your Zola's godmother.
you have to go to her birthday party.
besides, I'm just gonna stay here and eat widow casserole, feel sorry for myself.
go. Out.
okay.
happy birthday.
Hey, girl. - Look who didn't just wake up, huh?
look at you. You look so beautiful. Look at that.
you made it. - Of course.
Adele insisted I didn't miss little miss Zola's party.
so she's feeling better then?
uh, much. The night nurse is with her. She was already asleep when I left.
and this is for the guest of honor.
how are you doing, little miss Zola?
you look very pretty for your birthday.
Yes, you do.
I need 800 bucks.
told you, if you're dumb enough to buy groceries, I'm gonna eat 'em.
no, not for groceries. For a security deposit.
we'll lose out on a really great 3-bedroom if we don't get it to the landlord today.
now you want to live with me?
no, you're gross and a pig and a skank magnet and you leave your dirty boy socks everywhere.
keep going this way, and you'll wind up old and alone, wandering the streets with some ancient form of syphilis.
all right, I think what she's trying to say is, yes, she would be happy if you'd be our roommate.
cool - So...
we couldn't afford the nice apartment just the two of us, right?
hardwood floors and a washer/dryer.
what can I say? I want what I want.
she'll forgive us, right?
well, she won't remember anything.
a picture, right? - Yeah, picture.
Yes. Here we go. Here we go.
Yeah. Happy birthday. Happy birthday.
perfect. - Dada.
happy 10, 000th, Dr. Webber.
Oh, for me? No.
come on. It's...it's not every day you get to celebrate 10, 000 surgeries.
Thanks.
Hey, the dress you guys got Zola?
she loved it. - She loved it.
Sofia loved it, too.
didn't you love it, Mark?
it was adorable.
what can I say? I have great taste.
I-I'm gonna get a refill. Anyone?
Oh, I would love a glass of red.
enough of that. - Oh, Mark.
you two are the ones that love her.
it's like you want to take her behind a mini-mart, knock her up, and have all her babies.
Oh, my God. You guys would have such beautiful babies.
well, then Sofia would have a sibling.
except I'm not there yet.
she's great, and I'm happy you all get along, but I'm not rushing this.
I rushed it with Addison.
I tried to force Lexie to be a grandmother, for God sakes.
I'm not doing that again.
that is so adult.
you know what auntie Cristina did today?
I operated on a heart this b...
actually, no. That's not...
this big. This big.
it was as big as a bear.
they're not called lost causes because they're fun.
I don't need them to be fun.
I just need them to not be like today.
okay. Let's flip.
heads, you keep doing lost causes.
tails, you can do the fun stuff.
I'm in. Of course I'm in.
good. Come on.
let's go join the party.
I know you're mad, and I'm sorry.
sorry that you did it or you're sorry that I'm mad?
Teddy never came to find me after surgery.
Yeah, well, she's tired. - I bet.
I'm taking you off her service permanently.
I'm not sure what she's gonna do without you as her security blanket...
absolutely not.
well, this is the downside...
did you hear what I just said? Absolutely not.
I think "thank you" is what you were looking for, because frankly, I could've fired you both.
you have no idea what's going on here, do you?
I have a very good idea.
you let me operate on her husband, and now he's dead.
she gets whatever she wants. Do you understand?
anything she wants from me, ever.
I heard the good news.
Bailey says you're declaring general.
actually, I'm not sure anymore.
Oh, I... thought it was a done deal.
I mean, it makes sense since you're...
because of my mother. I know. Don't you mention her, too.
that's all anyone ever says... it's in my blood, it's my legacy.
that's why I don't want to do it.
I don't want to be like my mother.
Meredith, look at everything you did today...
this party for your daughter, what you did for me in that O. R.
you don't have to ever worry about being anything like your mother.
I knew her, and you're nothing like your mother.
you have a gift. Don't waste it.
it was an impossible situation.
Yes, and it was your call.
you put Henry on my table.
and then you had me lie to Teddy just like you did.
don't talk to me about consequences.
you can't even accept a simple punishment for what you did today.
you don't get to punish me. Okay?
it's not my fault Teddy hates you.
but don't take your guilt out on me.
guilt? I do...I have nothing to be guilty about.
this is all about you. It's always been about you.
we live like you want, how you want.
you get whatever you want, all the time!
when do you throw in the towel, admit that a lost cause is sometimes just that?
Hey, um, do you remember your first surgery?
well, sure, sure. I was a third-year resident.
third year's could take the lead on surgeries.
it's about how you constantly ignore me! Constantly! - A gallbladder.
you do what works for you. You don't care who you crush in the process...
there comes a point when it all becomes too much...
or who gets hurt! - It was one surgery. Okay?
it was one surgery. - It was not one surgery! Do you hear me?
this was every choice we've made in the last...
it was...it was a life that I envisioned for myself, okay?
this is not one surgery.
when we get too tired to fight anymore.
so we give up.
it all comes back to this?
Yeah. Yeah. Crazy, right? That I would ever bring it up again.
okay. Yes, okay? Yes. Yes!
okay, it was a horrible situation, but it's over.
is it too much to ask that we just try and forget it?
you killed our baby! You don't ever forget that!
that's when the real work begins...
to find hope where there seems to be absolutely none at all.
the baby you have is the baby you were destined to have.
what you thinkin', huh?
it was meant to be. - You gettin' tired?
that's what all the adoption people tell you anyway.
anyway, I like to think it's true.
but everything else in the world seems so completely random.
you gonna talk now, too?
what if one little thing I said or did... Could have made it all fall apart?
what if I'd chosen another life for myself... Or another person?
we might have never found each other.
what if I had been raised differently?
what if my mother had never been sick?
what if I'd actually had a good father?
what if?
what if?
what if?
Meredith. - Good morning, mom.
morning.
are you riding with me or with your father?
because if you're riding with me, we have to leave now.
don't wait. I'll go with dad.
good. - Who's coming with me?
Oh, hiya, darling. - Hi.
don't be late, Either of you. Sets a bad example.
it's true.
Oh, thank you so much. - You're welcome.
okay.
all right.
I need you to sit right here and wait until mommy comes out, okay?
don't move. Here. Play with your thingy.
and, uh, I'm gonna just be in the next room...
no, mommy! - Yes. Sit right there.
Hey, pumpkin. - Hi, daddy.
Hey, hey. Really?
Really? I mean, you couldn't figure out... Anything else?
well, Owen, if she's gonna schedule staff meetings before the day care opens, what do you expect me to do?
I know, I know. - Yeah.
chief's here.
okay, bye, guys.
I've been looking at Seattle pres' numbers, and I think we can absorb them the way we did mercy west.
I want reports on where your departments can use extra residents and equipment.
congratulations on your third Harper Avery Award.
portal vein reconstruction...pretty soon they're gonna rename The Whipple The Grey.
thank you.
well, there's some press here today... FYI.
okay, let's go. Trauma?
uh, abdominal closure on an M.V.C.and we will wait to see what comes in.
neuro?
I have a laminectomy.
just one? You got a golf game?
you know what, people? I keep saying it.
if you're not innovating, be generating.
cardio?
yang is doing a solo thoracic aortic aneurysm, oh, uh, and also, I'll be checking in on my kid with the artificial lung who is waiting for a transplant.
uh, yeah, can I just say for the record that he's my patient, and I don't agree with this method of treatment?
the fda has not approved an artificial lung on children.
well, I got emergency approval.
it buys the kid more time, it keeps him from being sedated and ventilated,
I think it's worth exploring.
he should be sedated. Let his body heal.
this is just too risky.
it's innovative. Shepherd, this is what I'm talking about.
let's hope it works.
good work, Torres.
general, Dr. Bailey?
uh, yes. An extended whipple.
speak up.
I'm doing an extended whipple.
Owen. - I got it.
Dr. Bailey, go on.
um, 47-year-old male, advanced pancreatic cancer with invasion of the portal vein.
well, what are you using to graft the portal vein?
the... Um, the jugular.
I'll take that.
excuse me? - I'll take your whipple.
send me the chart A. S.A. P.
okay. Well, I... - neonatal?
a pyloric stenosis. Actually, two pylorics and...
that's not a reflection on you, Bailey.
she probably wants a surgery to take her mind off of all the Harper Avery fuss.
now don't take it the wrong way.
I'm not.
good.
thank you so much.
Oh, my God!
when? - Last night.
I mean, I kind of thought he would, and then, sure enough.
are you okay, April?
cause I know... I mean, I knew this was gonna be hard for you, but...
you are going to find someone, April.
and Charles is really into you.
I know, I know, but Charles is...
Hi. Hey, April.
Charles is what?
nothing.
no, no, no.
I am thrilled. Have you told anyone else?
besides my parents, no. You're my person.
Oh, God, this is so beautiful.
you guys, you're gonna be, like, the next Shepherds.
screw that. We're gonna be the next webbers.
okay, how did he do it? Tell me everything.
okay, so last night, we went out to dinner, and he...
good morning.
are you talking to me?
Jackson... Don't feed the animals.
Hey! How's everybody doing this morning?
everybody ready to kick some butt?
let's run the board, guys. Avery?
covering the pit.
noble work. Y-Yang?
solo thoracic aortic aneurysm.
well, I guess that means, I'm doing Torres' post-ops.
Kepner?
uh, I'm on Shepherd's service. Good Shepherd.
Oh, hey. I'm on bad Shepherd.
maybe we're gonna be The Next Shepherds.
no, we aren't.
all right, guys. The day is as good as you make it.
all right, let's get out there and keep Seattle grace the country's best hospital.
come on!
yang, smile. Yeesh.
all right. Let's move.
uh, can I speak with you, Dr. Webber?
okay, okay, okay.
I thought we had a rule about this in the hospital.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just... my God. You're so hot in that ring.
I do look good, don't I?
Hey, what did your parents think?
I mean, what did your mom say?
Oh, well, she loved it of course.
and she adores you.
well, you were a jerk before you met me.
she didn't know there was a good guy in there.
but I did.
Oh, I love it. And I love you.
have a great day.
okay, come on, guys and allegra. Let's go.
gosh, he's so good with the kids.
how's he doing? - He's better.
Yeah. I think we're past it. - Really?
Yeah. - That's great.
I know. I've just heard it can be... A hard road, coming back.
I mean, who knows what he went through over there.
Yeah, well... he doesn't like to talk to me about it.
but he does Skype with some of his old buddies that are still in Iraq, and, um, this guy Teddy seems to be helping him through it.
and he hasn't had another episode since that one.
so anyway, he's good.
he's good. We're good now.
I don't know how you do it.
and then with the kids, too?
Mm. Well... You'll find out soon enough, right?
Oh, besides, you and Derek will be fine.
you two are perfect.
all Ellis is saying is that she wants you to use your full potential.
Oh, hi, honey.
like that clinical trial you used to talk about.
I'm about to have a child, Richard. I don't have time for a clinical trial.
I think you should find it.
I think it'll do you good.
good morning.
a clinical trial... - this elevator is not working.
what an ass.
we brought you a cokehead found in an alley.
presumed overdose. Tried Narcan. No response.
had to shock her once in the field at 300.
all right. On my count. One...
stop. V-fib. Charge the paddles to 300.
clear!
there we go.
ready? - On my count.
one, two... Three.
Avery, she's all yours.
all right, let's get a tox screen, an E.K.G.a C.B.C.a C.M.P.and an x-ray now.
right away, doctor.
well, it's a stroke of luck, actually.
I'm doing a surgery today, and I'm planning to use the new grey technique.
so rather than a boring press interview, why don't you come on up to the gallery, take a few shots of the technique in action... And, uh, we'll talk after?
I'll see you in the O. R.
great. Sounds good. - Thank you.
that was brilliant.
why settle for another boring press release, right?
so can I scrub in? I would love to see the procedure done firsthand.
Why? Your focus is cardio.
you're not gonna get a cardio fellowship scrubbing in on your mother's whipple.
that's true.
Cristina Yang is doing a solo aortic aneurysm today.
I... that came in last night, and had I been here...
Yeah, but you weren't because you were too busy getting engaged.
so now that that's over, what do you want to do?
do you want to do an aortic aneurysm? - Yes.
do you want me to ask Dr. Torres to give it to you?
no, mother. I can get it myself.
there you go.
Dr. Bailey.
I am stoked for our whipple today. Are you stoked?
we, uh... No, we're not... - You gotta speak up.
we're not doing a whipple today. I had it taken from me.
Mandy. No.
please don't call me Mandy.
we talked about this. You can't let people walk all over you.
you gotta stand up for yourself.
not if it's Ellis Grey, I don't.
Ellis is operating? Come on.
the next best thing to operating is watching Ellis Grey do it.
we gotta get in on that surgery, Mandy.
remember what we say?
I don't remember what we say.
we create... - Oh, we create our own destiny.
our own destiny. That's right. Come on.
chop, chop.
hi there.
Oh, God. Ugh. What now?
well, you O. D.'ed, your heart stopped, but you're stable.
can I get a name, please?
Oh, so you can call the cops?
Nah, I just need anything really, so we don't mix up your pee with somebody else's.
you have my pee?
Yeah. You were kinda giving it away for a while there.
spectacular.
name?
Lucille. - Okay.
you're a funny lady.
well, that's how I make my living.
all right, Ms. Ball.
we are gonna get you worked up and send you on your way.
Hey, where am I?
uh, Seattle grace hospital.
Oh, God.
don't push. Theresa, don't push.
Kepner, what's happening?
she's dilated and effaced. The baby started crowning and then just stopped.
okay, move.
Theresa, you're doing great.
okay, Kepner, order up a 3-D ultrasound, stat, and prep an O. R. For a crash C-section.
and page my husband. - Right away.
what happened?
he detached the connector to the artificial lung, and I had to clamp off the cannula to stop the bleeding.
I told you this was a bad idea.
all right. Let's book an O. R. Let's get it hooked back up.
no, it's too dangerous. He has to go back on ECMO.
I-it's not working, so he's worse?
hold on. Everybody, stop.
look at his sats.
93%? He's never been above 79%.
his respiratory rate's good Riley, I-is it hard for you to breathe at all?
no, I can breathe.
okay, hold on.
you blow in this, okay?
what's happening?
he's breathing better than he should be.
he's breathing better than he ever has.
so he can use it until he gets the transplant?
we need to run more tests, but... From the sound of his lungs, it's possible he may not even need a transplant.
are you serious? - Well, you know, we have to...
are you serious? - We have to see the tests, but...
Oh, thank you! I love you! I love you!
I think I do, too.
okay.
wait. What?
but why? Why can't you do the surgery?
uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing it.
uh, I mean, I can. I would. She just...
there's protocols, and she... - Think of it as a huge upgrade.
you just got handed the keys to a Jaguar and you've been driving, like, a civic.
a good car. A solid, dependable car.
but Dr. Grey... - hello, Alex.
Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor, I'm Dr. Grey.
I'll be doing your pancreaticoduodenectomy today.
I'll graft with a section of your internal ILIAC vein...
a new technique of my invention.
by forgoing the use of the jugular, you'll have no visible scaring on the neck.
Oh, well, that's nice...
I'll gladly have you sign these consent forms.
it's a pleasure to meet you. I'll see you after we're done.
Jaguar. Doc... Dr. Grey.
any chance I could scrub in with you?
Alex, of course. Love to have you.
see? You have to speak up for yourself.
can you explain anything that woman just said?
you know, I-I, uh, excuse me.
uh... Here you go, sir.
your heart stopped again.
because of all the cocaine you've enjoyed, you're going to need a surgical implant... an A. I.C. D. pacemaker.
if you have any questions about this procedure, here's an informative brochure.
she's a ray of sunshine.
she is.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that you don't have any insurance.
so is there somebody maybe I can call... parents, somebody?
no. Parents are dead.
I'm sorry to hear that. Is it from disease, family history?
my mother died of a stomach thing. My father killed himself.
I am really sorry.
what's... what's funny?
I do have a sister. She's a half sister.
okay. Nearby?
very.
she's a doctor... At this hospital.
what, are you kidding?
who? Who? Who is she?
Hey, we've never met. She doesn't know me.
and trust me, she doesn't want to.
you paged?
Yeah, have a look at her ultrasound.
that is a massive tumor.
what? - Percy, shut up.
it's pressing up against the neck. Is the airway secured?
I made the airway. It's as secure as it can be for now.
why can't I see my baby? What's wrong?
Theresa, your baby has a tumor.
but Dr. Shepherd's here. He's gonna take good care of her.
the Shepherds are the best you and your baby could hope for, okay?
they are an amazing team.
all right.
wait. What's wrong with her?
what took you so long?
I wasn't standing around, Derek.
I had to make sure that the mother wouldn't bleed out.
if we wait any longer, she won't even be a mother.
it's pressing against the trachea.
I need to make sure the airway's secure.
the bleeders can't wait.
you have to work on the neck as I operate.
it's gonna take us all day.
I'm sorry. I know you weren't planning on spending the day with your wife.
I'll see you in there.
it's a beautiful day to save lives.
nice.
Oh, hey, darlin'.
what's up?
I have to steal a surgery from Cristina Yang.
well... Yang's always stealing surgeries.
that girl gives me the creeps.
I know. It's just... Mom's operating today, and I thought it would be nice to go in and see it, but she doesn't want me in there, so...
remember when you were learning how to ride a bike and you ran into the back of the Richmonds' station wagon?
vividly.
what happened after that?
I sat on the curb and cried and bled all over you.
well, after that?
you made me get back on my bike.
no. Your mother made you get back on, and you learned to ride a bike.
she just wants you to succeed.
I know.
I'm doing a proctocolectomy right now.
you want in? - Single incision?
I probably shouldn't.
Yeah. Probably not.
how many aortic aneurysms has she actually done?
two... in the hospital.
she's probably done more at home on cats.
Hey, does she eat with anyone, ever?
no. That's what happens to you when you screw an attending.
you're a pariah.
unlike your approach of just never having sex with anybody?
no virgin jokes. - Thank you.
her and Preston Burke? Really?
and apparently, it was so scary for him, he actually had to leave the state.
I always say, never mess with the crazy chicks.
she's probably gonna go full-on Izzie one day and shoot up the hospital.
what's Izzie?
Oh, it means "crazy."
she was a girl in our class who was sleeping with a patient.
and then she stole a transplant heart for him. - What?
until Meredith turned her into her mom and got her fired.
Oh, my God, Mer. You're so brave.
hold on a second. How many people washed out your year?
uh, two. - Uh, her and O'Malley.
he, uh, failed his intern exam and was never seen again.
okay. Here I go.
where are you going?
to get back on my bicycle.
Dr. Grey is gonna graft an ILIAC vein to the portal vein, but that man's got bilateral deep vein thrombosis in his femorals, and the ILIACs won't be usable.
I mean, she's gonna look first, right?
who's that woman with Dr. Robbins?
I don't know. Some ortho surgeon.
I should've gone into ortho. I liked ortho.
why didn't you?
well, when Ellis Grey says you're good for cardio...
excuse me, Dr. Torres.
I was wondering if I could do the aortic aneurysm today.
this will be Yang's third, and I've only done one.
so it's only fair... - Webber, I know how many you've done.
and I know what my residents need, okay?
my mother suggested that I ask you.
why don't you split it?
you and Yang can, uh, do it together.
thank you.
whatever Ellis Grey wants. - You know it.
yang's not gonna like it.
well, it's better than kicking her off the case.
bitch scares me.
Lucy. You got some's plaining to do.
I'm gonna, uh, I'm just gonna go.
no, you're not, because if you don't get this procedure, you're going to die.
look, I get it. I know. It is scary.
but I can tell you everything that's gonna happen.
Yeah, I already read the brochure. - Okay.
the automatic implanted cardioverter defibrillator is placed beneath the skin below the collarbone.
the electrode wires th... Yeah, I have a photographic memory.
Yeah. Okay.
well, you should go to med school.
right. Or I could be a ballerina.
I'm serious.
okay? You should see all of this as a second chance.
people turn things around all the time. You're smart.
you're sharp. You're beautiful.
you got a sister here you've never even met.
you could have a whole new family.
let's start by fixing your heart, okay?
Oh, okay.
Oh. All right.
it's gonna be okay.
what the hell is Meredith Webber doing on my aortic aneurysm?
listen, if you tell Meredith or Ellis or anyone that surgery is mine. You can't just throw your girlfriend on it.
I swear, Yang. I will fix it so you never see the inside of an O. R. again.
I will bury you. - I'm not sharing my surgery.
change the board and get her off.
look, I didn't change the board. Torres did.
Where's Torres then?
C. S.F. is leaking. Let's get some suction in here, Percy.
I need you to have lunch with the president of the board of the Bryson school tomorrow.
why are you talking about this now?
because, Derek, you're never home.
you're always spending the night in that stupid trailer on that stupid piece of land planning that stupid house that you're never gonna build.
pulse ox is dropping. What did you do?
I didn't do anything. It's invading the tracheal wall.
clamp. - Secure the airway. We're losing her.
I'm working as hard as I can, Derek.
you just pay attention to what you're doing.
uh, do me a favor.
I'm going into surgery. - Yeah, just tell Dr. Grey that the patient has a history of D.V.T.
and that the ILIAC veins may not be suitable for grafting.
whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait. What?
why didn't you say something?
just... you're going in there. Just tell her.
you tell her. He's your patient.
I'm not gonna tell her she's wrong.
I mean, she... she took the chart. She read it. Right?
Yes. She knows what she's doing. - Well, just tell her.
yang, wait.
when in the hell are you gonna give Lucille Ball her A. I.C. D?
you have to do it. I've got surgery.
I don't think so. You did the consult.
Where's your wife? - What?
she was supposed to place a pacemaker in our O. D. girl hours ago...
and now she's trying to pawn it off on me.
I have a surgery.
you're the cardio consult. You do it.
Avery can do it.
I can't spare Avery.
I'm not giving up this surgery to stick a pacemaker in a junkie.
tell your wife to have Meredith Webber...
yang, just back off!
I'm sorry. I just... I just got really...
well, you won't need stitches... This time.
I thought it was supposed to be getting better.
or are you gonna hit another intern?
no.
why do you keep helping me? Why don't you just report me?
because I'm a doctor.
please don't tell my wife.
well, you can finish the rest of this. I have surgery.
suction here.
so June sounds good. Have you thought about where?
Oh, M-Meredith and I thought about, uh, Hawaii. That might be cool.
you know, have everyone come out and...
really, a destination wedding? Alex, I'm running a hospital.
I can't just dash off to... retract that, please. Clamp.
you'll do it here. I'll book the rainier club.
it's gorgeous.
that sounds great.
what the hell am I looking at?
the ILIAC veins are completely thrombosed, both of them.
unusable. Completely unusable.
did you know about this?
uh, no.
okay. Change of plans.
we'll use the renal vein.
damn it.
someone page Dr. Bailey, please.
I want her in here now.
why aren't you doing a TEVAR?
I'm doing a direct approach. It's cooler.
a TEVAR is safer. It's far less invasive.
you go in through the femoral, you don't have to crack the chest.
I already ordered the graft.
you two might have worked out your surgical plan before this.
I did, and my surgical plan didn't include this nimrod.
no, it just included hacking up the patient like a psychopath.
girls, don't make me come over there and do it myself.
shut up and work.
10-blade.
where have you been?
I'm, um, booking an O. R.
I'm gonna take my... that girl up for her pacemaker. Why?
somebody made off with an armload of drugs from the dispensary... codeine, morphine, demerol.
- Okay, why...
because the dispensary was accessed with your I. D. Card. That's why.
Oh, damn it.
but you knew the patient had thrombosis?
I...I had... I did. - Speak up.
in the legs... yes.
um, did you look at his chart?
of course I looked at his chart.
but there was no indication that the thrombosis was this bad.
why wasn't it in his chart?
because I had chosen to use the jugular.
they were in the medical records.
and you didn't tell me because I'd opted to not cut the man's throat?
well, that's... It's a good plan...
but I ended up cutting his throat anyway.
my procedure's a wash, and the patient's been under far longer than is optimal.
that's why I picked the jugular.
is that right, Dr. Bailey?
is that why you picked it?
Alex, where's my graft?
here's the graft.
I'm just suturing.
Oh, my God.
I might have nicked the carotid.
you people are trying to kill me.
did you get the whole tumor? - I told you.
I'm not asking for myself.
I'm asking what I should tell the mother...
just go. I will talk to her myself.
so we'll talk about the preschool... - it's gonna be late.
I'm gonna stay and look into this clinical trial.
that's great.
one more reason for you to stay out of the house.
that's fine.
it's fine. Maybe you'll be more interested once the baby comes. - Right.
everything's gonna be different when the baby comes.
well, a girl can hope. - Nothing's gonna change.
what do you think is gonna change?
do you even want a baby? - I didn't say that.
I'm not ta... - Yes, I want a baby.
no, I'm not talking about a baby. This baby, with me.
do you love me?
do you?
of course I love you.
can you say it without looking at the floor?
less than three minutes of circulatory arrest left.
you go over that, and the organs start dying.
if Webber hadn't taken so long...
I took the time it needed. - Two minutes.
done. Go back on bypass. - Yes, doctor.
Oh, got a leak.
okay, I'll find it. I'll throw a stitch.
no, it's too risky. The leak is behind the heart.
you need to do an internal graft.
will you shut up? I will find it.
Dr. Torres?
Webber's right, Yang.
her way is safer. Let her do it.
5-0 Prolene.
move your hands.
move your hands, please.
what are you doing? Move your hands.
I got it. I found the leak.
uh, give me a clamp. 2-0 Prolene. I got it.
have you seen my wife?
as a matter of fact, I have.
she just threatened to quit.
do me a favor. Wash your laundry at home, not in my O. R.
well, oh, there's two sides to every story...
Yeah, I'm not interested in your side.
Derek, Richard and I had very high hopes for you, but you have been nothing but a disappointment.
you don't publish, you don't teach, your attitude is terrible.
the residents have a nickname for you, and it is not flattering.
what do they call me? - Get it together, because if it comes down to a choice between you and her, you need to be very clear which one of you I will choose.
trust me, you two don't want to be the next Shepherds.
so I start to do the repair...
and she just stuck her hand in? - Yes!
wait. What happened? - Yang's a freakin' maniac.
she's dangerous.
my patient's fine.
awake, great vitals, if you were interested.
you had no business shoving in there.
you had no business in that O. R.
I wasn't about to let that guy die watching you Jack around with the internal graft.
that was the right technique.
Dr. Torres specifically...
Dr. Torres only sided with you because you're the chief's little girl.
she's a pathetic lackey.
well, we'd all be working under Dr. Preston Burke right now, but you screwed us out of that opportunity, literally.
what exactly did you do to him?
because he left the state to get away from you.
good one.
if you want to get personal,
what? What are you talking about? What...
she's a lunatic. - What... what... what is she talking about?
you can't believe a word she says.
she's just... come on!
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm s... I'm sorry. I... Oh, God.
Oh, just shoot me now.
Oh, God.
tests are good. Sats are great.
he's breathing unassisted. He's gonna be home by the end of the week.
and he's been taken off the transplant list?
Yep, yep. Two weeks on your little thing, and his lungs are actually improved.
well, good work.
Oh, amazing work.
and I didn't even want to do it.
it was amazing. You're amazing.
well, um, we should, uh, celebrate sometime.
Yeah, we should. We should go get drinks.
I mean, this is... This is one to celebrate.
Dr. Torres, here are your kids. - Yeah.
Oh, hi, baby girl. Hi.
okay. Well... sometime.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sometime.
all right. Here we go.
slow down... And tell me.
I can't.
I mean, I can't believe them. I cannot believe them!
I heard what happened.
you did? - Yes.
and you should be upset.
you should be humiliated. - Ellis...
you don't let Yang, you don't let anyone show you up in your O. R.
understand? Ever.
I shouldn't have been in there.
I wasn't prepared.
then why in the world did you go in?
because you pushed me.
and you aren't mad because I embarrassed myself.
you're mad because I embarrassed you.
Ellis, what in the hell is wrong with y...
I want you to fire Mandy Bailey.
tonight, Richard. I want you to do it tonight. - What are you talking about?
what is this about? - She made a complete fool of me.
I had no idea, no idea at all.
I looked like... like a total failure.
okay, look... now look, just hold on.
now... now just... Just breathe.
I was humiliated.
okay.
in front of all those people.
I was just trying to fix her stupid mistake.
I know.
I looked... I looked like a fraud...
but you... you know you're not.
you know that.
like an idiot.
there was nothing to graft.
okay, look, okay, but you... you made it work.
you always do. The patient is fine.
look, you can't control everything.
I know you want to.
but you can't, okay?
is Meredith all right?
I don't know how to talk to her, Richard.
will you talk to her?
Yeah, I will, I will. She'll be all right.
I am horrible at it. I am terrible.
Oh, I just want her to do well. I just want her to do the best she can...
I-I know. I know you do. And she'll be okay, okay?
I promise. Okay?
thank you.
thanks... For today.
tell your wife and get some help.
she'll leave, and I'll lose my kids.
she... She's... She's afraid I'm gonna hurt one of them.
aren't you?
Hey. - Hey. How are you?
okay. - Oh, my gosh. What happened to your hand?
Oh, oh, I,uh... I, uh, some junkie patient knocked me into a tray of instruments, so...
Oh, you poor baby. All right. Let's get you home, and I'll take a look at it, okay?
okay, let's go. Come on, allegra. - Come on. Let's go.
all right.
I need help.
she was just lying in the street. I almost ran her over.
okay, we've got this.
pulse is V-tach. Where's the crash cart?
charge to 360. Sir, step back.
it's all right. I'm a doctor.
Yeah, we're all doctors, all right? Now move.
clear.
charge to 300. Clear.
sinus tach. We got her.
okay.
you know where I can find Dr. Shepherd?
which one?
no, dad.
don't come and clean up after her again.
you do it every time.
and it's beneath you, and it's pointless.
I can't do anything right for her.
your mother doesn't want... - And I finally figured out why.
she wants everyone around her to be ordinary so she can be extraordinary.
she wants everyone around her small.
Oh, you stop it. - And that's what she's done to you.
she has made you small.
and I'm not gonna let her do it to me.
I don't, uh... I d... I don't know what's wrong with me.
all I know is that the baby is coming and I want it.
you know, it... It may change things.
you'll get happier.
we'll just take it one step at a time.
I want to make it work.
it isn't your baby.
it's stupid, I know, but it's a brand-new shirt and now it's got junkie blood all over it.
this is awkward.
clear. I've got a rhythm.
barely, but... Damn it. It's gone.
if you had just done the damn surgery...
asystole. Uh, give her 1 amp of atropine.
I already did it, okay? It's not helping.
another, and an amp of EPI.
do it.
go!
move. Let's crack her chest.
gown. - What?
n-no. It's not indicated. She O. D.'ed.
okay, so she's gonna die anyway.
what has she got to lose? Chest tray.
here you go. - Right here.
okay, let's do it. Betadine.
10-blade. - On it.
are you crying?
I screwed up.
I... I had a good thing.
she was a good person, but... I had a chance to be better.
and I screwed it up like I do every frickin' time.
what the hell is wrong with me?
I just lost my job.
do you see me crying?
I have no earthly idea what to do next, but am I hiding in an elevator, whimpering about it?
no. - No.
because what do we say, Alex?
what do we say?
we create... Our own destiny.
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
you should, too.
guys, you lost her. - Shut up!
one more AMP of EPI. Charge to 20. - Charging.
charged.
clear.
charge to 30. Ready?
go. - Clear.
sinus tach.
wait. Wait.
your life is a gift. Accept it.
she's back. - Okay, we got her. We got her.
no matter how screwed up or painful it seems to be.
okay, now what do I do?
okay.
fast, fast, fast, fast.
Ah. Okay. That's good.
what?
we don't have to do that thing where I say something and then you say something and then someone cries and there's a moment or whatever?
Oh, yuck.
good.
it's just that... Nothing is turning out the way I thought it would.
it's like I don't even recognize my own life.
I know what you mean.
some things are going to work out as if they were destined to happen...
I gotta go get some sleep. You gotta get some sleep.
you look like crap.
I look better than you.
not possible.
your mother says the residents have a name for me.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
what is it? What do they call me?
come on. - McDreary. We call you McDreary.
you think that's funny? - It's apt. McDreary.
Yeah, that's my life.
so how about tonight, you're not McDreary?
you're just... You're just a guy in a bar.
and you're just a girl in a bar?
I am. And I drink Tequila.
Tom. - Here you go.
Cheers.
as if they were just meant to be.
there's a baby in the bed. - I know there's a baby in the bed.
there's no baby in the shower.
there is no baby in the shower. - All right.
there's a baby in the shower, too. - Oh, come on. Just look the other way.
I can't do it in front of the duckies. - Yes, you can.
do it in front of the duckies. - Oh, no. Come on.
where are we gonna go now?
okay, stop saying that.
good morning.
Yeah, I'm watching a pyeloplasty. I can rewind it back to the beginning if you'd like.
no, let's go.
Hey, listen for the baby. - What?
20 minutes.
okay.
don't! Don't! Don't!
stop, Derek.
Ow. Ow. That... - What?
let's just try to move the seat back. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
is that better? - Yeah.
Oh, good. Come here. - Okay.
I'm sorry, but she woke up, and she seemed like she wanted you guys.
but don't worry. She didn't see anything.
we're never gonna have sex again, are we?
happy Valentine's day.
okay, baby. There we go.
well, listen, I can babysit tonight if you guys need some time to... yourselves.
cause I have, uh, no plans' cause my life is empty.
I'm alone with no plans whatsoever, - at all. - That's great.
so did you, um, did you make a reservation somewhere beautiful with lots of flickery candles?
I made a plan.
I think you'll like it.
you should pack a bag. - Oh, wow.
overnight? Oh, gosh. Well, what about Sofia?
mark got a sitter. He'll be home at 11: 00, and then he's got her.
all right. Well, what should I bring?
a bathing suit? Or I don't know, what are we talking here?
no bathing suit. Boots wouldn't hurt.
all right. So cold. - Could be.
wouldn't hurt to bring long underwear, extra fleece.
Yeah. Hey, don't make that face. - No.
it will be fun. - Mm.
Yeah. Romantic.
there are times in our lives when love really does conquer all exhaustion, sleep deprivation and anything.
and then there are those times when it seems like love brings us nothing, but pain.
tonight is still gonna work out, right? - Of course it is. We have a plan.
I'm just saying... - Here you go.
you cancel a lot, because of the scalpels and cutting people open.
look, I was promised an elegant dinner.
I rearranged my whole schedule.
I've got high heels in the back of my car.
I'm gonna spend all day thinking about 'em.
is it camping?
I mean, does she think I'm going camping on Valentine's day?
I don't know.
well, she's trying to surprise me.
I'm telling you, the surprise is that I'll leave her by the mountain.
I mean, do you think camping is sexy? It's not sexy.
you can't take a baby camping. Sofia's gonna hate it.
what, you're getting a sitter. Callie said you're getting a sitter.
Yeah, Callie also said you were going camping.
Callie's lost her mind. - Thank you.
really, it's camping?
I don't know, but it's your night with Sofia.
well, I need to have sex with my wife, apparently in the woods on cold, hard ground.
and you promised Callie a sitter, so get a sitter.
come on. This thing with Julia is young and fragile.
there's a lot of pressure. I got us a table at Campo's.
well, then you better find a sitter.
I have plans.
Yep. I got a hot date.
our... our thing is... is young and fragile, too.
we're gonna get a zillion valen-traumas.
I bet a few of them will be good surgeries for our boards.
well, it's not St. Patty's day.
those are good traumas... car crashes, bar brawls.
Yeah, Valentine's day is all swallowed engagement rings and guys who threw out their backs getting laid.
you're just bitter' cause you don't have a date.
first of all, Valentine's day isn't for having a date with some chick.
no, it's for macking the chicks who don't have dates.
besides, I have to study for my boards.
you studying already? - Of course. You're not?
no, I am.
who put up all this? - I did.
well, research shows that a cheerful environment reduces stress and helps patients to feel more...
okay.
I have to get that baby out of my bed.
she's ruining my sex life.
Yeah, well, mine's already dead.
he's gonna leave me.
he won't. - Yeah, he will. He is.
I mean, I know it. And you know what?
I don't care.
you know, if he wants to leave, if he wants to hate me, then fine.
I can't make someone stay. - Well, you could kinda beg him to stay.
I'm busy. I'm focused. I'm a surgeon.
well, everyone's a surgeon. That doesn't mean that's it.
for me, it does.
I'm brilliant. I'm gifted.
I- I don't beg.
you know, if he wants to go, then fine. I'm good.
Hey, have you guys started studying for your boards?
Yeah. - Yeah. Why?
Yeah. Cool. Me... me, too.
I need labs in bed six. About time, Grey. Bed three.
okay.
well, anything for me?
six weeks of headaches, like blinding.
we were in here last week. They did a brain scan, but they didn't find anything.
said it was probably a migraine, but the pills don't help at all.
Janell, can you rate your pain for me on a scale of 1 to 10?
this morning, it was, like, an 11.
but now it's more like a...
Janell? - Honey?
Janell? Can you hear me?
does this happen a lot? - Yeah. She just shuts down 'cause the pain's too much or something.
we need an E. E.G over here. And let's page Shepherd. Quickly, please.
right away. - This isn't a migraine, right?
no, it's not a migraine. She's having a seizure.
I have been off of Dr. Altman's service now for two weeks.
I stepped over a line. You reprimanded me.
continuing to punish me is... - fine.
on her service.
get down!
look out!
are you okay?
Yes.
you sure?
Yes.
I don't know what happened! I just walked in here!
airway seems fine, but he's got some J.V.D.
he's tachycardic with muffled heart sounds.
what happened?
sir, you're at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. Your van crashed.
no one was hurt, but we need to get you examined. Come on.
I must have fallen asleep at the wheel for a second.
I've been working like a dog all week.
Oh, God. No, no, no. I-I gotta go. I...
sir, relax, relax. Just lie down. - No, I have to go. I'm a florist.
these roses won't last in the open air.
they're gonna wilt. - Sir.
sir, you need to calm down. We're gonna get you out of here.
maintain in line stabilization.
we need to get trauma labs, films, and ultrasound.
make sure that C. T. is available, and Page Altman.
right away, doctor.
she's not responding to the seizure medication, Randy.
she is in serious danger of suffering severe brain damage, which is why I'd like to place her in a medically induced coma.
a-a coma? What do you mean?
basically, a deep sleep to prevent the seizures from damaging her brain.
it will also buy us some time so we can figure out what's causing them.
she just turned 32. We've never talked about medical decision-type stuff.
well, every seizure Janell has hurts her brain a little bit more.
we need to do this now.
Oh, God. Yeah. Please do it.
okay. - Do it, please.
push 150 milligrams of propofol. Call respiratory while I prep for intubation.
Kepner, forget the flowers. Throw them out and get back to work.
you're not throwing those flowers away?
but... but he... - he doesn't need to know.
throwing away perfectly good flowers. Everyone's a cynic these days...
talking about not believing in Valentine's day.
I mean, what's wrong with a day devoted to the person you love?
I take this day very seriously.
I know you do. Happy anniversary, sir.
thank you, Dr. Grey.
I'm heading home early, try and spend most of the day with my wife.
what about you? You hitting the town?
I'm not hitting much of anything these days.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
that was crass. I'm h... uh, uh, have no Valentine's plans.
what the hell was I thinking? I should've listened to my mom.
I used to be young! I used to be pretty!
I have wasted my entire youth on you!
Charlie Bilson, 32, hit by a car when he ran head-on into traffic.
complains of chest and back pain. - I thought it would happen!
has abdominal tenderness on palpation. - How stupid could I be?
and it looks like a broken nose. - How stupid!
I cannot believe you did this!
okay, if you hadn't made me chase you down...
you should not have chased me. You shouldn't have bothered, because it's over.
this is over. - What happened?
we're having breakfast in bed. One second, you're so happy...
I thought you were going to propose!
well, what do you think?
well, she's wheezing, but we'll treat that.
you're gonna be just fine,
Clementine. Uh, I think the kids call her clem.
you're not the mom? - She's on her way. She was at the gym.
I'm just the moron that bought the box of peanut clusters for the kid who's allergic to nuts.
my son wanted to give her a Valentine.
she took a bite, and this happened.
I'm... I'm gonna start you on a breathing treatment.
and then I'm gonna give you an I. V. with medicine to treat the rash, okay?
okay. - All right.
here. If it hurts, you can squeeze my hand, hard as you want.
okay, clem, here we go.
ready?
three. Okay.
good.
honestly, those little boxes? They taunt me, Charlie.
I would rather a nice coffee table book or maybe even a mug, because then at least I wouldn't get my hopes up every freakin' Valentine's day when you pull out the little velvet box.
you didn't even look at the necklace.
I didn't have to. It wasn't a ring.
Oh, that's a... Pretty nasty cut there.
Dr. Grey.
you want to take a look?
sure.
come with me.
a man should get to bleed in peace.
Thanks.
what?
I was trying to figure out why this patient's having seizures when I noticed she has a hemolytic anemia.
which means she's having an autoimmune response.
right. If antibodies are attacking her red blood cells, who's to say that antibodies couldn't be attacking her brain, causing the encephalitis?
and it's not a brain tumor. That's why you paged me.
well, yeah, and I thought we could spend Valentine's day together.
you may not have Valentine's day plans, but I do, Grey, plans that I am not willing to forfeit. So here's how this is going to go...
in a timely and efficient manner, you and I will rule out everything that could be causing this woman's body to attack itself, virus by virus, tumor by tumor, until we land on the one thing...
it's a teratoma. - What?
I sent off Janell's C.S.F. from her spinal tap for anti-n. M.D.A. receptor antibodies, and it just came back positive.
show off.
let's get a scan.
is this our flower guy?
Yeah. He has an intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernia.
how did his abdominal organs get into the sac around his heart?
uh, his chest hit the wheel when he crashed.
well, I'm gonna have to reduce the hernia.
book an O. R. Bump any nonemergent patients, and find someone to scrub in with me.
Dr. Hunt has agreed to let me back on your service, so I can scrub in with you.
Really?
we need to get in there and do the repair before he tamponades, so we should move as quickly as possible.
like I'm ever anything but.
you must think I'm such a bitch.
no.
it's been eight years, and it's... it's...every Valentine's day, the buildup gets worse.
this morning he wakes me up, and breakfast in bed, and then he tells me, he booked dinner and a nice hotel at the pier, and then he pulls out another cheap ass necklace.
eight years.
we're not exactly teenagers.
maybe he doesn't know how much you want it.
we go to 20 weddings a year, and I sob like a lunaticat every one.
I'm not that sentimental. He knows.
C. T. shows extensive internal bleeding. He's also hypotensive.
we have to get him up to the O. R. now.
what... what's going on? What's happening?
we're taking your fiance to surgery.
he is not her fiance.
suction.
Yeah, watch the... - Oh, sorry. Sorry.
so anybody got any good Valentine's plans?
my husband died in this O. R. a month ago.
Dr. Yang performed the surgery.
I was in a 7-hour surgery and didn't know that he had died.
Dr. Hunt kept that a secret. So I don't speak to him.
he wants a baby. Dr. Yang doesn't.
so they don't speak to each other even though they're married.
so...
no.
how about you?
my girlfriend and I are gonna...
nothing.
nothing.
we think this thing on Janell's lung is something called a teratoma.
it's creating antibodies that are attacking her brain.
well, I don't get it.
basically, her body sees the tumor as an invader and is attacking it, and her brain is getting hurt in the crossfire.
so this thing on her lung is causing her seizures?
I think so.
we'll have to remove it and test it to make sure.
O-okay, so you take it out, her headaches stop, and she wakes up from the coma, and we get to go onto live our lives?
that's the plan.
okay.
we've known each other since high school.
she's my better half.
I mean, I know people always say that...
but she really is.
you paged me for this? Why would I do this?
because it's fair.
because the three of us are equal parents to Sofia and this is the fair way to decide who stays in with her.
unless you want to cultivate her unjustly and uneducated in a state of chaos and disorder.
your call. - Okay. Fine.
best two out of three? - Best two out of three.
you ready?
rock, paper, scissors.
rock, paper, scissors.
ha! My rock... Crushes your scissors.
rock, paper, scissors. Rock... hold on, hold on. Time-out.
time-out? I'm sorry, time-o... time-out?
Jackson, team huddle. - Oh, my gosh. Are you guys kidding me?
I mean, some of us have surgeries.
can you just give us a second?
what do you think? - I think she's going paper.
she's going with rocks. I'm thinking she's a rock thrower.
Yeah, that's what she wants you to think. All right?
that's why she did it two times in a row.
this time, trust me...
go scissors.
okay, you guys, it's not a chess game.
can we just... can we do this? - Get out there.
all right.
here we go.
rock, paper, scissors.
No! - Oh, yes!
damn it!
I'm getting lucky tonight. Happy babysitting.
see you later. - All right.
Avery, I said rocks. My gut told me rocks.
you messed with my head. - You asked my opinion.
Julia's gonna kill me.
she's having a severe reaction. Sorry, Clem.
it looks like we're gonna have to give you a shot.
okay.
hand? - Yes, please.
excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, Clem.
Oh, honey.
you poor thing.
Hi, mom. - She's gonna be fine.
the doctor's gonna give her a shot. He's on top of it.
well, I'm glad someone is. - I didn't know.
the school sends home notes all the time.
it's in every newsletter.
she can't even be near peanut butter. - I have a job, Terri, okay? Three kids.
excuse me if I don't read every note the school sends home.
I gave her a shot of epinephrine. It should do the trick.
he's hypothermic. - Yeah. There's too much bleeding.
he's not gonna make it if we keep going.
let's pack him an get him up to I. C.U.
to stabilize him.
I am not babysitting. - I have made your career, and I can break it.
I need to check for a septal hematoma. I'll be quick. I got a date tonight.
what makes you think I could babysit?
well, you know C. P.R. you can think on your feet, you're fit, you can run out of a burning building in no time.
septum looks fine.
and I'm not gonna cancel a date on Valentine's day.
women claim that they don't care, but they all do, a lot.
okay, uh, let's prep him for I. C.U. And I'll... I'll stay and monitor him.
no, it's your anniversary. I'll stay.
I thought you had a hot date. - Really? With who?
Dr. Sloan, I mean, if you're finished here, we'd like to...
Oh, I'll tell you who's finished.
you're finished.
thank you.
I already pressed it.
whatever.
I'm moving out.
so if you need me, I'll be at my mom's till I figure something out.
okay?
okay.
Hey, I got your message your lung resection went long.
I pushed our reservations to 8: 00.
Really? Just like that on Valentine's day? - I got connections.
I could even push 'em to 9: 00 if you like.
no. Absolutely not. No.
as soon as path confirms that the mass we took out was the teratoma,
I will go out to my car, grab those heels...
benign granuloma.
all right, fine. Push the reservation to 9: 00.
why are you still here? You can go.
I'd love to. I'd love nothing more.
but Nico won't leave until he knows Clem's gonna be okay.
he's 10. Who's the parent here?
you let that kid run wild.
at least I don't hover over him, afraid to let him out of my sight.
well, maybe I need to hover because you and your son won't leave us alone.
what were you thinking, dropping him at my house today when I wasn't home?
he wasn't gonna stay.
he just wanted to give your spoiled daughter a box of freakin' chocolates.
well, stop giving us things. We barely survived the head lice he gave her.
you have no way of knowing who gave who the head lice.
okay, that's enough.
they're 10. They're in love. They're cute.
let them be cute, for crying out loud.
excuse me, doctor, something's wrong with Clem. She's breathing funny.
get me a size 6 E. T. tube. - What's happening?
her airway is shutting down. I'm gonna have to intubate.
Oh, my God.
all right.
I'm in.
all right.
there's good color change.
SATs are coming up.
what happened? - Anaphylactic shock.
we're gonna have to keep her overnight and see how she responds.
but... but she's gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah, I think so.
now will you go? Please.
it doesn't make any sense.
Janell's labs show she has a teratoma.
then the lucky woman has two tumors...
the benign one that we just took out of her lung and another one...
where?
her scans and he ultrasound are clean.
what if it's microscopic?
okay, um...
what do we know about N. M.D. A. receptor teratomas?
we know they're most commonly found on the ovaries.
you want to take out her ovaries? She's 32 years old.
they're always 32 and nice and undeserving.
these kind of things don't happen to nasty people.
his vitals are holding.
that's good.
his pupils are a little sluggish.
Sharon, are you okay?
can I get you anything?
I had a ring picked out.
I sent a picture of it to all of my sisters so, uh, they could help Charlie surprise me when the time came, 'cause that ring was important.
it was so freaking important.
look at him. He looks... he's...He looks...
I don't care about that crap anymore. And I don't need a stupid ring.
I just...I just need him
that's it. I just want him to be okay.
please. Just let him be okay.
your incision looks good.
you should be back on your feet in a few weeks, but I wouldn't recommend pulling any more all-nighters, even on holidays like today.
trust me, brother. I'm done. I mean, what a stupid business.
people call you up, you know, they ask you to make something beautiful.
Yeah, so some sorry schlep can forget that they've been treated like crap every other day of the year.
Yeah, like my flowers are magic or something.
but I bought it.
nearly killed myself trying to make sure everybody got their little miracle.
what a joke.
people oughta just stop being so awful to each other, you know?
leave me out of it.
Dr. Yang will check on you later. - Thank you.
can I just talk to you for a minute?
I know you've been through hell, and I know I was part of it.
and I know you're grieving, and there's no magic solution to that, but...
we used to be friends. And I really...
really need a friend today.
so how about we just go across the street to Joe's, and I'll buy you a drink, you know?
or I will buy you many, many drinks.
are you done?
are you finished?
Yes. - I hate you.
from the moment you decided to put the needs of your hospital over my dead husband, I have hated you.
I lie in bed at night alone, and I look at the spot where my husband used to sleep, and I actively hate you with every cell in my body.
I wish you were dead instead of him.
I think about all the soldiers, good men, who died over there in Iraq, and I don't understand what kind of God would allow you to survive.
we are not friends. This is not grief. It will not pass.
I hate you!
Please...Don't speak to me again unless it's work related.
L-l-let me... let me get this straight.
all right, you...
you take this thing out of her lungs, and it's not what you thought it was.
now you want to take out her ovaries.
the kind of antibodies that she had are most commonly associated with teratomas of the ovaries.
but they can sometimes be found in other places, which is why we thought the mass on her lung was it.
chances are high that it's on her ovaries.
chances are? That's the best you can do?
she's young. She still wants kids. We...
no. You're doctors.
you're gonna have to do a hell of a lot better than "chances are.
if we do nothing, she will continue to have the seizures.
and eventually, her body will just completely shut down.
and by that time, she will have suffered so much brain damage that Janell, the woman that you love, she'll be gone.
the nougats are gone. Sorry.
did you get these from a patient? - No.
I bought these for Julia, but...
she's standing me up for an emergency ocular transplant surgery, so I'm gorging myself on Valentine's chocolate.
I'd mock you right now if my mouth wasn't so full.
try the square ones.
they're caramel with sea salt.
I didn't want to disappoint her.
you know, I bought candy and flowers.
I got rose petals, Lex.
bags of 'em.
I was looking forward to sharing it.
but now I'm alone on Valentine's day...
eating chocolate.
I can do you one better.
my hot date tonight?
Zola.
I am babysitting.
let's move! He's coding! - He's crashing.
what is that?
what's happening? What are you... What are you doing?
can someone please tell me what is happening?
Sharon... - He was just fine one second ago.
no, you need to go. Now! - What's happening?
somebody page Dr. Webber. - Taking over compressions. He's in V-fib.
push an AMP of EPI and charge the paddles to 360.
is it loaded?
Yep, we're doing it.
clear.
he's hemorrhaging. Probably in D. I.C.
okay, charge again. Go.
hang some D. F.P. and Factor VII.
clear.
Oh, God. No. - I'm so sorry.
his heart stopped, we tried to revive him, but despite our best efforts, he didn't make it.
he died at 7: 53 p. m.
no indication of a tumor. - It could be microscopic.
there's a lot of adhesions on this one, that could mean inflammation.
which could mean a teratoma.
so let's take out the right ovary, send it to path, and try to save the left one.
Dr. Grey, I'm the G. Y.N.
I really should be the one... - Okay, but you're a third year, and I can't trust third-year hands.
Boki, clamp.
I'm goin' with her.
ever thought you'd be wishing so hard to find a tumor?
No! No! No! - Honey, we're leaving now.
no, I'm not! I promised Clem I'd stay with her!
Nico, don't make me pick you up.
you're too big for this. - Come on. She's...she's right, dude.
this is embarrassing, you know?
I'm a little embarrassed for you. - I don't care.
what's Clem gonna think if she wakes up and I'm gone?
she'll think that I don't love her.
uh... Look, uh...
what if I'm there when she wakes up? I'll tell her whatever you want.
it's like the next best thing to being there.
promise?
Yeah.
you're gonna need a pen and a pad of paper.
good. Uh, all right. Here we go. Pathology's back.
the ovary specimen you sent is normal. No pathology seen.
damn. - We picked the wrong ovary.
there's a chance the other one's clean, too.
you don't have a very good personality, you know that?
the teratoma is there. It has to be.
well, if not, we'll have just sterilized a woman for no reason.
I'm done. I'm... I'm... I am done with him.
Yeah.
he actually thinks that we can just forget everything that happened.
I don't even know how to...
how can he think that we would ever, ever be friends again?
standing over me is not gonna make me read it any faster.
this part of the specimen is a little abnormal, but until I look at a couple more slides...
move over. - No.
move... over. - Oh, fine.
Dr. Bailey, see what I see?
I haven't confirmed it yet.
a mix of different cell types, which is compatible with teratomas.
is that what you see?
Dr. Russell?
okay, yes. I'd say, it's very likely a teratoma.
Yes! - Teratoma!
Hey.
how you feeling?
okay.
yeah?
W-where's Nico?
well, he wanted to stay, but, you know, his mom made him go.
figures.
Yeah.
but he, uh, he told me a few things he wanted to say.
but, uh, well, here we go.
dear Clementine, I'm really sorry you're sick.
but I'm not sorry you're my girlfriend.
it's the worst, being alone on Valentine's day...
but I'm thinking about you right now.
I'm thinking about holding hands with you and jumping on the trampoline together.
I love you.
and PS...
I don't care who gave who lice, I'm just glad we both had it together.
love, Nico.
I'd say you picked a good one.
will you marry me?
what should we do?
you want to see if the game's on?
I got steak and I bought a really good red, and a salad, and I'm gonna cook for you.
I have a girlfriend.
and she's operating tonight, so as soon as you put Sofia down, you can help me study for my boards, 'cause I am behind.
way behind.
What'd you pay for that bottle of wine? - 50 bucks.
I'm not great at surprises.
I-I-I wish I was, but I know we're camping.
you know, I'm pretty sure that we're smack-dab in the center of one of Washington's fine national parks, and I'm trying... I'm trying to have a good attitude, but this whole blind thing is just not helping matters.
this is you with a good attitude.
Oh, fine. I'll shut up.
okay. Are you... hey, are you peeking?
no. I'm not... no, I'm not peeking. - All right. Okay.
okay. Are you ready?
are you ready? Are you ready?
Ta-da!
Derek's trailer?
I figured, he wasn't using it, so I asked for the key.
we really are camping.
fun. Fun. Yes, fun. - Yeah!
we're not really camping.
no. You hate camping.
I do.
I really do.
I mean, it's almost camping, only...
there is a bed...
and lingerie.
no one's around for miles.
our patient's seizures stopped, - and you know why? - No.
because I found this teratoma on her ovary.
well, you know, you could've told me this at dinner.
you didn't have to show me a chopped up ovary.
little sucker thought it could hide from me, but it couldn't.
it took a while, but I finally figured out where it was, and I went in and nailed it.
you are so sexy when you're looking at a teratoma.
yeah?
grade five?
ruptured?
Yeah, send him over.
blunt trauma to the kidney. Guy crashed into a pole, not only shattering his kidney and his renal artery, but ruining my Valentine's day.
let me do it.
Oh, no.
sir, uh, I-I don't want to ruin your night, too.
just go. Get home.
Oh, and it's your anniversary.
Oh, for God sake. Adele's probably so angry at you...
I just went home.
she didn't recognize me.
she thought I looked like a nice guy and invited me to join her for dinner, flirted with me over steaks, thought I had a nice smile.
so, no, Dr. Bailey, my wife's not mad right now.
in fact, I think she's falling in love with me.
sir...
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, go. go.
I'd like to be alone right now with a kidney and a scalpel.
go. - Okay.
I'm just gonna go.
I'm gonna go and I'm gonna tell him, and if there is a, uh, ch...
no, I'm not gonna tell him. No, I'm gonna...of course...
okay, of course . no, I'm gonna tell him because if you don't say anything, then you... you bleed out and die and then read about it in a plastic locket.
I mean, what... what do... what do you think?
what should I do?
tell me.
Oh, look.
Oh, hey, hi. - Hey.
Oh, look, no, she's up, she's eaten. - Yeah. Good.
she's ready to roll. I'm gonna take... - Okay, so we just need we just need an hour.
no, I'm gonna take off. - Yeah, take her with you. Drive her around.
she loves that. - No, what? What?
zola, we'll be back.
okay, I-I'm still in my scrubs. I-I know.
I'm sorry. I had a surgery and then another one came in, and I know it seems like I blew you off, but I didn't. We can still go to dinner.
dinner is over. It's... it's 11: 23 p. m.
you blew me off for dinner hours ago.
I ruined our Valentine's day? - Miranda, I...
I'm a terrible person.
I-I know. I don't make time like I should.
I'm not good at, you know, romance-y... things, but, look, I am working, and you can't fault me for that.
you can't fault me for saving lives.
and if... if you're going to break up with me for missing a dinner because I was saving a life, then, you know, I don't even want to have romance-y things with you...
okay, Miran-Miranda. - Wait. Why are you in a suit?
because it's 11: 23 p. m.
Valentine's day isn't over yet.
you threw this together today? - Oh, no. no, no, no, no, no.
I've been planning this for weeks.
see, I knew there was no chance in hell that we'd make a scheduled reservation, so, uh, I booked Marco here.
I mean, I'm dating Dr. Bailey.
I know the drill.
I know you.
you know me.
and, uh, I even had Marco put extra crumb topping on your Mac and cheese.
I know you. - Okay.
thank you, sir.
I happen to be very good at romantic things.
Oh, yeah.
you are.
we're always looking for ways to ease the pain.
Hey.
I thought maybe the, uh, the girls could have a play date.
and, um, we could, uh, uh, to talk, you know, about stuff, 'cause there's some stuff that I've been wanting to say.
is that Julia?
I'll... I'll go. - Avery's cooking me dinner.
is that Julia? 'Cause I can go.
that's... - But he can go...
if you want to talk.
should he go?
Hey.
Nope. It's nothing. I... you...I'm just...
I'm gonna... it's...you know what?
you two have a very pleasant evening. - Don't be stupid. You love steak.
Sofia, your friend's here.
sometimes we ease the pain by making the best of what we have.
sometimes it's by losing ourselves in the moment.
please.
don't hate me.
I'm begging you.
and sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain which is called a simple truce.
we fight.
no, we don't. You yell and then you go silent.
I yell because you...
we don't communicate. There's no intimacy.
there's intimacy. - Okay.
all right. There's intimacy, but we're not on the same page.
Oh, be... because I don't do what you want me to do.
because you had an abortion.
we've done couples therapy before. He has P. T.S. D.
from the war, and she's had it, too. - From the shooting, but not at the same time.
we - we didn't have it at the same time.
and mine wasn't as bad as his is.
you lay on the floor of an O. R. - You choked me.
you quit being a doctor. So...
for a little while.
but now we're fine.
Really?
Oh, sure. Okay. We're fine.
I meant the P. T.S. D. - Okay. Yeah. We're fine.
we're fine. - Mm-hmm.
except for the part where you aborted the child that I wanted.
except for the part where you held my hand while I exercised my right to choose and then four months later, you screamed I killed your baby in front of all our friends.
when you've tried everything but that headache won't go away, you can't stop coughing, the swelling won't go down, that's when you turn to a professional.
so...
as surgeons, we spend years developing skills of perception that allow us to see exactly what the problem is.
you haven't even looked.
Amy, I am telling you, it is unrescetable. Let it go.
I came all the way from L. A. to show you this.
you could spend more than 30 seconds. - I am looking right at it.
it's a gliosarcoma that has invaded the carotid artery.
you try and remove it, she will stroke out.
stop being a jackass.
I'm... she called... she called you a jackass.
Dr. Grey, excuse us.
Dr. Grey, stay here. I need backup. - Fine.
you just got out of rehab.
I want you to get on your feet. But you can't help her.
look at his face.
his name is Mason. This gliosarcoma belongs to his mother Erica.
he's a great kid. I don't know him that well, but he seems great.
I do know his dad well. His name is Cooper, and he works with me and he is a good guy.
he is a good dad, which means he is the one who is gonna have to tell Mason that his mom is dead, that he doesn't have a mom anymore because we didn't do anything.
you tell Cooper you're sorry. You tried. Let it go.
I have a surgery.
trouble is, sometimes all that time spent developing those skills of perception can leave a person with an extremely narrow point of view.
and how are you supposed to argue with someone who has science on their side?
65-year-old woman enters the E. R. in shock.
presents with a pulsatile, expanding abdominal mass. Go.
ruptured triple-A. I would take the patient straight to the O. R.
and access the peritoneal cavity through a vertical midline incision.
nice.
you guys studying for the oral boards in the middle of the day?
just another benefit of having a study buddy.
you should get one. - I have one.
it's just that my stupid study buddy's too busy trying to save her stupid marriage to actually help me study.
well, you know what's better than a study buddy?
a study lackey. Check it.
Hey, you.
brown-haired girl, you're up.
trauma incident or a surgical situation?
you made your interns come up with study questions?
surprise me. - A 12-year-old boy fell off his bike, hitting his abdomen against the handlebars.
complains of progressive abdominal pain and is short of breath.
breath sounds cloudy.
what is it? - Sloan. 9-1-1.
Hey, if you want, we could... - I don't need help. I'm an excellent surgeon.
you know it, and I know it. Everybody knows it.
I don't have to prove myself to anyone.
Yeah, except to the American Board of Surgery.
Yeah, there's that.
no.
not Grey.
yang, maybe.
yang's a cowboy.
not kepner.
definitely not Grey.
she spent all that time in neuro, and suddenly, she's chasing general.
she's unfocused.
you're underestimating her.
I think she'd surprise you.
she'd have to.
she will.
she'll have to come to me.
I'd do an exploratory laparotomy. - You said that already.
I know. Um...
the patient's still crashing? - Yep.
I gotta crack open his chest. - You've gotta what?
relax. N-not you.
good morning, Chuck.
Hey, Karev. And, Dr. Peterson, it's always nice to see you in peds.
thank you, Dr. Robbins.
so, uh, Chuck's looking pretty good.
his, uh, abdominal pain's decreased, and I think it's a good time to schedule a gastroscopy.
great, great.
well, then, you're in luck, Dr. Peterson, because I think that Karev would be an excellent supervisor for your first gastroscopy.
thank you. - Okay, uh, Megan.
let's go schedule that gastroscopy.
it-it's Morgan. - What is?
my name. It's Morgan.
whatever. Same difference.
Carrie Rissler is my patient. Has been for eight years.
I'm aware. - She was given six months to live, but after a mastectomy, oophorectomy, and risky experimental biological therapy, I managed to save her life.
which is awesome. - D... no, it is not awesome. It is a miracle.
and when I saw on the O. R. board that my patient... my miracle...
is undergoing a lymph node transfer without my knowledge...
she came to us, Dr. Bailey.
said she brought it to you a few months ago, and you shot it down.
cause her extensive scarring makes her a poor candidate.
that's what I thought.
but then Avery suggested we do some angio studies on her arm...
Avery suggested?
Dr. Bailey, this procedure has had outstanding results for patients with-with vessels just like Mrs. Rissler's, okay?
this... - this could make it worse.
it-it-it could even kill her. - That's not gonna happen.
well, y-you're right, it's not, because you're not operating, not after I speak to my patient.
you paged me 9-1-1 to get yelled at?
no, I paged you 9-1-1 so that you could help me convince Bailey we're doing the right thing here. You failed.
okay. So what do we do now?
well, let's hope Carrie's a little bit more persuasive than you are.
Dr. Torres, Dr. Webber suggested... - here's how this is gonna work...
I talk, and you listen.
you are here because you and your little pals are all freaked out about the oral boards, and Dr. Webber suggested that Callie Torres might have a special secret study method, right?
Mm-hmm. - Yeah, Dr. Webber's correct.
Callie Torres does have a study method, an excellent study method, but she's not about to just give it away.
Callie Torres' study method has to be earned.
frankly, she doesn't think that Meredith Grey has what it takes.
I think she does. I think Meredith Grey has what it takes.
his B. P. was low and his vessels are collapsed.
we could only get one good I. V. in. - We're gonna have to get another one.
for her sake, Meredith Grey better hope she's right, 'cause today, today is gonna be a grind.
excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.
a grind? Really? - It's a meat grinder.
Oh, whatever. Like you weren't thinking it, too.
hang in there, Dom. - Yeah, you're looking good, bro, real good.
you're lying, Tommy.
I look like sopressata. - Don't worry, Dominic.
we just gave you some drugs for the pain. - Okay.
you're gonna start to feel better real quick.
what do you think, Dr. Torres? Is this an amputation?
I - I don't know. Is it?
Tommy. - What?
no, you tell me, Dr. Grey. Does this look like an amputation to you?
I mean, yeah. - Amputate?
no, you can't. I need my hand.
Tommy, don't let them take my... - All right.
whoa. Is he... - No, those are the drugs.
they work quickly, just like we have to.
but you're just gonna cut off his arm? I mean, I...
no, this is a teachinghospital, Mike, okay?
I'm doing a thing.
Grey, here's how it's gonna work if you want my help on the boards.
you're gonna run this. You're gonna decide our course of action.
you're gonna be the person that stands between Dominic and a hook for a hand.
you in or you out? - I already said amputation is our best option.
best? - Yeah, best.
okay, so book an O. R. and fire up the bone saw.
let's move him out, please. Grey wants to amputate.
Dr. Torres, wait.
I have a finger here.
I knew that already, Dr. Grey. - No, a viable finger.
look at the cap refill.
I - is that bad or good?
Dr. Grey, is that bad or good? - That's good.
all right. So what do you want to do?
I think we should take this thing off And see what's left.
all right. Time's a factor here, Grey. - Why is time a factor?
because the longer his hand stays in there, the more we compromise his circulation.
tick tock, Dr. Grey.
so let's call up tomaintenance and get a sawzall.
you really want to wait that long?
fire and rescue has tools. - Better.
okay.
Hey, th-these tools, what are they gonna do, Rip apart the grinder?
to save his hand. - Yeah, we dropped a couplegrand on that thing.
you can't trash it. - To save his hand?
Mike, how long is it gonna take you to get that thing apart?
I-I take it apart and... and clean it every night.
we can get him out. - Yeah.
quick. - Dr. Torres?
can you do it in under 45 minutes?
give or take?
Grey? - Dr. Grey what?
do I think it's okay to let a couple of civilians take apart the machine that's grinding their brother's hand?
Yeah.
let's do it. - Okay.
I'm gonna need a set of allen wrenches and a phillips head screwdriver.
make that two.
stat!
hang in there, Dom.
Hey, you paged?
look, I can remove the tumor and the diseased carotid together.
all I have to do is run balloon catheters in through the femoral, place them in precise position, inflate them to stop the blood flow, do two arteriotomies, then feed a heparinized shunt into place, and reestablish blood flow.
that's all?
and I have to do it in 90 seconds.
any more than that, and she strokes out.
is that even possible? - Not sure. I would love to test it out.
we should set up a simulator.
don't we need to get Derek's approval? Yeah, but that shouldn't be a big problem...
he loves to say no to me.
that is his favorite thing to do.
maybe you should refrain from calling him a jackass.
I can't help it, 'cause he is one.
maybe I should ask him.
would you? - Yeah.
he's in surgery, O. R. two.
you just called me down here so that I would go to Derek for you, made me feel like it was my idea.
aren't I good?
amazing.
I have always been clear... - You have not always been clear.
she loves to say that. - Always been clear... I do not want kids.
he knew that. - I did not know that.
you knew that. - I did not know that in the beginning.
what, I have an icicle in me, and I'm supposed to tell a stranger, "Hey, I don't want to have kids"?
I'm not talking about the icicle. I am talking about after.
after.
no, I told you when it was relevant to the relationship.
most people would've considered dropping a bomb like that before the wedding.
that is when it would've been relevant.
well, uh, you proposed, and we were married like 12 hours later.
so sue me if, in the moment, I was thinking of other things.
I - I know the lymphedema is bad. - Oh, it's miserable.
these are sausages, not arms.
I can't lift them. Oh.
I'm in pain all the time.
I think...
look, we just need to be happy the cancer is gone and look at the lymphedema as...the price we're paying... - The price I'm paying.
Oh, look...
you don't think I felt awful, sneaking in here likea thief to get my surgery? But I'm just...
you saved my life.
you know how I feel about you. You're a hero to me.
but I... I want to be able to brush my hair...hold my grandson.
Erin had a baby? - Having one, in the spring.
Oh, e... oh, my...she was just starting college when you were first diagnosed.
I know.
you promised me I'd make it to her graduation.
if you... really think this is a mistake,
I won't do it.
o-okay. You got it? You got it? - I got it.
so what's your plan, Grey?
okay, my plan is, they get this thing off, and then we assess.
right, but what if they don't? You need an alternate plan.
well, I don't need an alternate plan, because they're gonna get it off.
What'd you do? - I didn't do anything.
the more you guys loosen that, the more he's gonna bleed.
should we stop? - No, keep going, just go faster.
y-you sure you have time for that?
if you have something to suggest, why don't you?
now you're just wasting everyone's time.
well, we have to get him up to the O. R. or he's gonna bleed out.
Yeah, well, his hand's still trapped in that grinder.
let's get a pneumatic tourniqueton his arm above the grinder.
that'll buy us a few minutes. - Okay.
I can give you guys 15 minutes, and after that, I have to amputate.
understood.
we've operated on worse.
Lexie, she showed us a picture of a little boy.
I know. I-it's clear that she is passionate...
my sister is too emotionally wrapped up in this patient to clearly see that she can't help this woman.
you know, it tells me that she's passionate enough to try harder.
Yeah, well, all the passion in the world is not gonna make herplan doable in 90 seconds.
you need to see that for yourself, fine, set it up.
only you're gonna be the one who sees a thing.
I mean, thank you.
Dr. Robbins said I would be doing this.
Yeah, how can you do a gastroscopy and read the index cards?
come on. Keep 'em coming.
congenal aganglionic megacolon, also known as...Hirschsprung's disease.
typical treatment? - A pull-through procedure.
did you skip symptoms? - Uh, symptoms, right. Sorry.
don't crap out on me now, Megan. - Morgan.
symptoms, uh, severe and persistent tightness in chest, indigestion, blurred vision, shortness of breath...
Yeah, that's not Hirschsprung's. - Severe headache, nausea.
patient is 24 weeks pregnant. - Yeah? Well, that narrows it down.
it could be P. I.H. Yeah, I'd order labs and, uh, a U. A.
then I'd take her down to the O. B. so she could be monitored.
okay. Yeah. Y-yeah. You should... you should probably do that.
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey.
are you gonna just stand there or are you gonna help her?
when were you gonna tell me you were pregnant?
everybody in this hospital knows that I'm pregnant.
but then they... they also know my name.
well, there's a good fetal heart rate.
the baby looks fine. These are definitely not contractions.
list the symptoms. - I am not quizzing you right now.
no, your symptoms. Chest tightness...
nausea, shortness of breath, indigestion.
you mean like, uh, heartburn? - Mm-hmm.
page cardio.
you're having a heart attack.
there is no deeper reason. - There has to be.
there is no deeper reason. I wasn't abused.
I - I don't have a dark secret. I wasn't mugged by a baby.
I just don't want kids. - Nobody doesn't want kids.
people can not want kids. It's a thing.
that is not a thing.
well, it's my thing.
you're gonna change your mind.
you're gonna change your mind in three years or five.
you're gonna change your mind about having a baby, and then it's gonna be too late. And you're gonna regret it.
and I will know and understand that I made a choice.
I choose medicine. I choose me.
I choose that over the remote possibility that I might one day regret not having a child.
and by the way, it's all right to never want kids.
some people don't ever want kids. - Well, I want to know why.
Why?
in 2004, I was removing mets from Carrie Rissler's abdomen and pelvis, and decided to go for one near her liver when she started bleeding out.
as I was trying to stop the bleeding, she went into heart failure.
I had to send her to the I. C.U. tell her daughter Erin that she was in a coma and that there was a good chance she wouldn't wake up.
but she did.
and she still had two more surgeries ahead of her and chemo and radiation.
her body is a battlefield... - I get it. You talked her out of it.
no.
you're doing the lymph node transfer, but not without reading everypage of this file twice.
but we're supposed to operate in half an hour.
then start reading.
okay.
I'm watching you, Avery.
Yes, ma'am.
come on. - I almost got it.
come on. Come on. - B. P.'s dropping, Grey.
you guys need to be done now.
just one second, Dr. Grey. Just one-one more...
and done.
we should be able to turn back the auger and pull him out.
no, we'll pull him out. It's time for you to go.
Grey, take this. You've got the auger. - Okay.
look, can't we just stick around and see...
there we go.
holy god.
okay, so... we've got a piece of hand with sort of fingers on it.
what about these? Can these be saved?
I don't know. Can they?
boom!
97 seconds.
bite me!
sorry. Just...
sorry. I just...
I've been at 97 seconds for 8 freakin' tries now.
maybe not the ninth.
if I can find another stopwatch.
I mean, Derek's probably right. I'm just... I'm gonna let her down.
he should know. I've let him down enough times.
let's take a break.
let's go, uh, you wantto get something to eat?
I want something.
it's not food.
there's a guy who go this hand stuck in a meat grinder.
I...wouldn't mind seeing that. - Yes.
okay, Morgan, you had an acute M. I. from a spontaneouscoronary artery dissection.
are you kidding? I - I don't have any of the risk factors.
Yeah, well, most likely, related to your pregnancy.
we need to get you upstairs right now.
Dr. Robbins, why are you here? - We need to repair the dissection immediately.
my baby's fine, right? You said that my baby was fine?
Morgan, listen to me... - If my baby's fine, why are you here!
lie back, lie back, listen to me.
all right, we need to go right now.
but it's too early to take the baby out. He-he-she could have R. D.S. or get septic?
the dissection's extensive.
we have to put you on bypass in order to fix it, so the baby needs to be delivered now.
she barely has any lungs.
24 weeks is premature, but there's a very good chance.
no, you-you can't say that, okay?
I know what you can and can't say is very good...
and you can't say that.
listen, my baby was born at 23 weeks, and it's terrifying, I know, but I'll be here for you. We're all gonna be here.
will someone call my boyfriend? His name is the first in my phone.
all right. Karev, call her boyfriend and let him know what's happening.
I'm scrubbing in.
she's your intern, Karev.
Yeah, okay.
wait. Uh...
her name's, uh, Megan, right?
her name is Morgan.
Grey, I'm surprised.
I wouldn't think you'd be thrown by a little thing like a severed finger.
Yeah, well, it's just, it smells like pork.
there she goes again.
she's gonna yack.
would you quit it with that, all right?
I gotta finish this thing before I go into surgery.
Hey, where is your study lackey?
of course the one competent intern in the whole program just so happens to be pregnant and needs surgery for a coronary artery dissection.
morgan needs surgery?
how do you know about Morgan?
everybody knows about the pregnant intern, Karev.
there's my ride.
here we go.
if Morgan needs surgery, then why are you here?
my attending gave me a job... call the boyfriend.
I left, like, six messages.
Chris is a fourth year at the Cleveland clinic.
I mean, you know how busy it gets.
how do you know his name?
they're not just amputating and fitting him for a prosthetic?
no. She thinks she's gonna be able to salvage the finger bits and reattach, because she's cracked.
that's gonna be so much harder.
you know what else would be harder?
going through the carotid.
for fingers?
it would be harder, but there'd be better control than going through the femoral.
all right. All right. Come on. Here we go again.
come on, Mer. Just a few chunks.
Oh, come on. Just puke already.
that's a good-looking lymph node.
you got it? - Yeah.
OOP. - Did-did he say "Oops"?
Dr. Bailey. What a pleasant surprise.
the man said "Oops." - I didn't.
actually, Dr. Bailey, I just said "Oop."
he was picking up a lymph node, almost dropped it, but didn't.
let's make some room so Dr. Bailey can get a better view of our every move.
as you were, Avery.
y... you-you don't want a little more suction, Avery?
Dr. Bailey, while I'm always glad to hear your perspective,
I'll instruct the resident.
but your instructions result in oops. We don't oops in my O. R.
let's try a little more suction.
with Mr. Hamilton's laminectomy,
I want an epidural drain for the next few days.
Yes, doctor.
you should at least listen to her.
look, I swear, you gotta stop encouraging her.
well, this is what you taught me to do.
you taught me not to give up until we've tried everything.
because you can handle it.
when we lose a patient,
I know if you're okay or you're not because I'm right there with you.
with her, I cannot do that, because I don't think she can handle it.
not now.
you are the one who is too emotionally involved.
okay, if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor, you would still be looking at it.
you are so worried about your sister's outcome, you won't even think about her patient's.
am I wrong?
you have to try.
I am. I'm-I'm trying. - We're supposed to focus on each other and breathe, and you're not. I mean, your mind is totally elsewhere.
Oh, so now you know my every thought and intention?
we used to be able to look at each other.
and I'd feel...like we were gonna be okay.
there is a reason we're together, Owen. There is a reason we're married.
please.
look at me.
all right. I'm looking at you.
right now...
I'm looking right at you.
he has to stop holding a grudge.
he has to see me for who I am.
he has to take his little list of all my crimes - and rip it up, otherwise... - Otherwise what?
you know, I - I don't know.
how about you stop thinking that you're the sun, and that I revolve around you, and that being a cardio god, maybe that isn't everything, and maybe what I need is worthy of some consideration?
and we're back to the abortion?
Yeah.
Yeah, we are.
I'm ready for the transfer, Avery.
Dr. Sloan. - Yes.
you know that this patient has a history of multiple surgeries in that area.
she sure does.
okay, then I don't understand why you think it's a good idea to continue to dissect right there.
respectfully, Dr. Bailey, it's not entirely important that you understand everything I do every step of the way.
no, respectfully, Dr. Sloan, I disagree. I think it's extremely important.
now if you had read the file like you said you did, you'd know that she'd have massive scar tissue exactly in the area that you're dissecting, so I think going forward with that dissection is amonumentally stupid course...
respectfully, Dr. Bailey, the bulk of that scar tissue is gonna be found near her axilla.
so if Dr. Sloan continues dissecting right there,
I really don't think there'll be a problem.
and I - I read that in... in-in the file, the file that you... Carrie's file... that you gave me to read, I...
I did... I did read it.
damn it. Oh, - we've got a big bleeder here.
is that subclavian?
respectfully, doctors, I told you so.
okay, so I think it'll work.
if we cut down the macerate dpart of the finger, it'll be short, but it'll still be salvageable.
okay, but this thumb, I'm gonna go ahead and say that's not salvageable.
Yeah, you're done here. He'll be better off with a prosthetic.
no.
the thumb is responsible for 40% of hand function.
without it, we're done.
but there's gotta be something else.
I mean, I read something about surgeons using a man's big toe as...as a replacement for a thumb.
let's do that. Let's... let's use his big toe.
listen, Dr. Frankenstein, the big toe, it's pretty important, you know, for walking.
and he can learn to rebalance. - Or he can keep his toe where it is.
this is a good fix. I know it is. - No, it's not.
Dr. Torres, it has to be.
the big toe is not the fix. That is why we're gonna use the second toe.
it'll provide the same benefits, but reduce potential disability.
Really? - Yeah, but we're not doing anything without the patient's consent.
all right. Tell me what you're trying to do.
I'm going in through the carotid with two catheters, uh, one in the proximal...
a carotid stick? That'll kill her even faster.
damn it, Derek... - Amy, I'm sorry, but you can't stop and reestablish blood flow in 90 seconds.
I mean, I can't do it in 90 seconds.
well, the great god of neurosurgery has spoken...
look, now I'm-I'm trying to help you. But please don't put yourself through this.
you're too fragile. - I am not fragile.
I'm a drug addict.
I've fallen off the wagon twice, and I've gotten back on.
that does not make you fragile, Derek.
that makes you very freakin' strong.
I am standing in a building full of pills right now, a fact that I am painfully aware of, but I am doing this.
that is not fragile.
okay.
show me what you're trying to do.
so you think there's a way?
no, I don't.
but I can't stop you, so, um...
I'll be here with you.
show me what you're trying to do.
I was right.
right?
too soon to tell.
cut the crap, Torres.
you two are gonna put a toe on a man's hand.
that was her idea.
maybe we are.
his toe?! Are you serious?!
maybe we're not.
Tommy, calm down.
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. It's just...
that's weird. - Yeah.
but if I say okay, I get my hand back?
otherwise, you fit me for a hook?
a prosthetic, but if you give the go-ahead...
he gets a hand.
well, what are you looking at me for?
take my toe already.
take my left nut if it'll help.
I... think the toe will be fine.
I was right.
so...
this is how you're gonna spend your time now, pulling strings behind the scenes like some kind of puppet master?
I am really good at it.
so I'm a 2-month-old baby.
symptoms? - I'm underweight, fussy, I belch, and when I vomit, it hits the ceiling.
you have pyloric stenosis.
these cards are so detailed. Whose are these?
well, those would be the smart one's.
the only smart one.
what the hell? What happened to Morgan's baby?
wait. Morgan had her baby?
Oh, crap.
one more clamp, please.
well, is it subclavian? Can you get under the clavicle?
vascular clamp. It's still oozing, Dr. Avery.
how do you want to proceed?
I, uh, I don't... I don't know.
Oh, he did not just say "I don't know."
man, tell me what you see.
we're staring straight at the defect. You think we should call in vascular?
no, no, I think- I think we can repair this ourself.
maybe patch it? Stick-stick tie. - Patch it?
Yeah. Isn't that... - No, no, it's a good thought. Get on that.
bovie.
sorry, Dr. Sloan. Just a little distracted here.
Dr. Avery, let me give you one small piece of advice.
if there is anything,
I mean anything, distracting you from helping your patient, you need to leave it outside.
Oh, respectfully, I...
this is your patient now.
yours.
someone had better tell me what is going on and had better tell me right now.
Dr. Bailey...
you need to leave this O. R.
excuse me?
this patient, my patient, developed a subclavian bleed because we misjudged her adhesions.
but I am now doing an arterioplasty, which is not an easy thing to do, and you are making it more difficult by distracting me.
you are compromising my ability to care for my patient, Dr. Bailey.
well, if you're telling me you can't focus in...
I'm telling you, you need to get out.
now.
Dr. Sloan, if you let your resident speak to an attending this way...
Dr. Bailey.
I believe Dr. Avery made it very clear.
leave the O. R...
or I'll have you removed.
get out of the way! Move! Move!
damn it!
wait. Is that for the Peters on baby? - For the mother. It's not good.
all right. Get outta the way!
come on. Come on.
crap.
what the hell happened?
we were barely in the NICU before he suffered an intestinal perf.
scrub in. I need your extra hands.
give me a minute.
Hello?
Yeah, this is, uh, Dr. Alex Karev. I work with, uh, Morgan in Seattle.
listen up, you're... you're fourth year, right?
good. Listen up, she's still in surgery, but she's critical, so's the baby.
you need to get on a plane right now.
Oh, come... Meredith and I do not do everything together.
the twisted sisters.
Yeah, well, we're best friends. What do you expect?
she has a baby. - Oh, my god. That doesn't mean I have to.
I don't see why not. You do everything else together.
it's like you're a team. - Because she's my person.
I should be your person! - Be my person!
be my person, Owen! Be my freakin' person!
be my person.
he's dorsal dominant, so I'm not going to use a plantar incision to find the artery.
okay. - And I have isolated a good draining vein.
is that it? You're not gonna ask me if I'm sure?
are you... sure?
Yes.
okay, then.
you're impressive.
I am.
look, there's always been a lot of hype surrounding you, okay?
"meredith Grey, ooh, child of Ellis." "Ooh, isn't she so special?"
you don't have to help me if you don't want to.
no, no, no, that's not... that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying...you're tougher than I thought. I'm saying, you're smart. I'm...saying... okay, look... you know, we've never been friends, not even when I was with George.
mainly because you thought I was a freak and you're blonde and very...
and now you have a baby, and I have a baby, and we're both married, and...
I don't know. I'm saying, we're both alike.
I'm saying I'll help you.
you're not a freak.
and we can be friends.
every morning, five days a week, you are in my office at 4: 00 A. M. and we work, Grey.
if you don't show up, if you are late, I will kick your ass.
we work, Grey. We work.
and you're gonna pass this test. You're gonna pass it hard.
okay. We've got it threaded.
we need to position the balloons and then inflate.
you need to get yours in position faster. - I think you should do it.
you can do it. You just gotta get in there faster.
okay, ready?
inflate.
starting the clock. Let's move.
Mr. Price is awake and responsive. And the rest of the post-ops are done.
what are you doing?
we needed two surgeons.
one on the internal carotid, the other on the external, controlling the balloons.
we've almost got it to 90 seconds.
you think it's gonna work? - Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
it's one step, one step of a very complicated tumor.
he doesn't think it's gonna work. - Well, we're gonna go down trying.
that's all. Thank you. You can go.
I want to go down trying. - All right. Pick up the stopwatch.
Hey, little boy.
I'm Dr. Robbins, and this is Dr. Karev.
you've got a long road ahead of you, but we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
and your mom, too.
how's she doing?
Morgan?
I haven't checked.
I ran a pregnant chick all over the hospital today.
made her quiz me on my stupid boards till she damn near died, and I haven't even checked to see how she's doing.
apparently, I'm the only person in this hospital who didn't know she was pregnant...
because I'm too busy worrying about my own stupid damn self to even make an effort to learn my interns freakin' names.
it doesn't matter if I pass those boards or not,
I don't deserve that fellowship.
you know why I like you so much?
I honestly have no idea.
you remind me of me.
peds surgeons? We're-we're vicious.
we're the most hard-coresurgeons in the hospital.
I mean, when I was a resident, I was...
I was a full-on horror show.
but that's what it takes to learn how to save tiny humans like this one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
but do me a favor.
learn your interns freakin' names.
we may not like it...
but it really is important to stop every once in a while, get out of your own head, and see the bigger picture.
uh, Dr. Sloan, I need a word with you about Avery.
Dr. Bailey, I have a patient.
he was right.
Avery... he was... was right. She's gonna be able to use her arms.
so...
why did I say no?
you were being careful. - Yeah, but she was my prize patient.
I've done ground-breaking work on her behalf.
you were a resident like Avery.
you get more experience, you get more conservative.
C-conservative?
is that what success buys you? What, you get happy and then you get scared?
don't want anything in life to change?
you're a grown-up. You're risk-averse, 'cause you know risk has actual consequences.
that's why we keep residents around.
they keep us fresh.
are you telling me that I'm not young anymore?
I'm trying to tell you, you've arrived.
you pull that crap in my O. R. again,
I'll report you to the board.
Actually...finding out that you've been looking at things all wrong...can be sort of liberating...
what happened?
you're fine.
you know, Altman, she did a kick-ass repair on you.
my baby?
where is my baby? - He's stable.
okay? I mean, uh, that's the first thing. - He?
Oh, yeah. That's...
I guess the first thing. He's, uh, he's a boy, and, uh, he's, uh, stable.
But?
he's intubated.
we're giving him indomethacin to, uh, treat his P. D.A.
and he had a, um, spontaneous intestinal perf that we fixed.
Robbins, she's, uh, she's observing him right now.
listen, Morgan, he's...he's doing great right now.
and Robbins is watching him, and, you know, when she leaves, I'm gonna watch him, and, you know, I - I talked to Chris, and he's on his way right now.
okay?
okay.
so, you know, I thought I'd just hang out here for a while with you, and, uh, you know, wait till Chris gets here.
leave it at that, if that's okay.
you're hanging out here because it's quiet and you need to study.
what? No. No way. - You should.
I - I would.
and suddenly you see new potential...
new possibilities...
okay. - Where you'd never seen them before.
done.
we have blood flow.
86 seconds.
call your patient. Get her up here.
and that's all fine when a hopeless situation suddenly looks good.
unfortunately...
I'm afraid our time is up.
sometimes it goes the other way.
where are we with avery?
holding offers from U.S.C,Penn, Tulane, and Emory.
tulane and Emory are in love. They want him bad.
every september, thousands of 'em ditch rainy Seattle to winter in Mexico.
these birds aren't dumb.
Grey? - Uh, still between Boston and Seattle.
if I'm gonna lose one of my talented residents and my top neurosurgeon, i'd love a decision sooner than later.
you and me both, Hunt.
Yang?
well, she didn't tell you?
uh, Stanford and Columbia are playing hardball, but I'm confident that we're still in the mix.
and every year, crowds of people gather around seattle to drink beer and watch the flocks take off.
Lee, Steinman, and Renaldo?
offer from Rice. - Leaning toward Wash U.
Baylor and San Diego are both after him.
they call it the great migration.
well, karev is staying.
if we are out this many surgeons, i'm gonna need to hire now, so let's get answers from our people as soon as possible.
thank you.
and let's not forget that we've agreed to assist Boise Memorial with their conjoined twin surgery, so make sure your teams are ready to leave from the lobby no later than 10: 00 tomorrow night.
you should be proud.
you trained these kids well.
you should be proud. You trained 'em.
Yeah. I sure did.
we passed our boards!
we killed the boards!
I just think it's weird that we're not even talking about it.
you know, things are unresolved here.
we're still friends. It's all good, jackman.
I love this song!
Kepner's wasted. That's a first.
Yeah, well, lately she's been all about... Firsts.
wait, wait, wait. Music.
this is Dr. Yang.
well, that does certainly give me a lot to think about.
thank you so much for calling.
mayo wants to give me a research lab.
so that's what rock bottom looks like.
music. Music.
hello. Uh, yes, this is she.
okay. Well, yes, thank you. Thank you.
um, thank you so much for the opportunity.
u. V.A. Wants a board-certified surgeon so they pulled my offer.
come on. Music. Come on. Sorry.
music! Come on!
what are you doing?
I don't know.
are you drunk? - I don't know.
we got one whole day.
Tuck's with his dad. I think we should make the most of it
sargent exhibit at the art museum, pike place, maybe watch the sunset over the water.
12 whole hours to get to know the city that you have lived in for the past ten years but still have yet to
no. No, no, no, no, no. You are supposed to be naked.
okay, well, the-the hospital just called.
a - a stomach perf with intestinal obstruction and an enlarged liver.
they don't know what's causing it.
uh, uh, could be fun. You want to come?
so how much longer do I have?
don't tiptoe around. Just give it to me straight.
Jake, you're not dying. He can be a little neurotic.
uh, we're hoping we'll be able to figure out more during your surgery.
well, do you think it's something that I-I picked up abroad, like ebola or something?
we were just on our honeymoon.
you two just got married?
you seem like you've been together a while.
it's our third in 12 years. Honeymoon.
we went to kaual the first time.
Oh, beautiful. - Yeah, then we got divorced.
then we went to Fiji the next time. - The beaches.
Yeah, and then we got divorced.
this time, my bride, she insisted on Thailand.
we just can't seem to stay way from each other.
con - Congratulations.
so this patch here is your tumor.
it's invading the wall of your right ventricle.
what we'll do is, uh, we'll resect the tumor, then repair the ventricle, and replace the tricuspid valve.
Dr. Yang is the best that we have.
y - you couldn't be in better hands.
come on. Where is she?
Arizona? She's, um... Patients.
so... So many patients.
so, um, basically, you all want to chop up my heart into a jigsaw puzzle.
it may give me a few more months, most of which,
I'll be spending in a hospital bed, while my best friend in the world does everything possible to avoid me?
or I spend the rest of my short life lying on a sandy beach in Belize.
Nick, you need this surgery... - Tell Scottsdale I said good bye.
looks like I won't get the chance.
hunt needs to know where we are on Boston, and I gotta let Harvard know what I'm doing by the end of the day.
we're not going. Anything else you need to know?
you know, I may have told you, I have family on the east coast.
a couple of times.
and I may have replied that my sister lives here.
and if Cristina chooses Stanford, it's a 2-hour plane ride.
but if she chooses columbia, it's only a 2-hour train ride.
we're not going.
they want me to run the entire neurosurgery department at Harvard.
Webber loves me, and Bailey loves me.
I will be teaching the best fellows in the world.
we are staying. - We're leaving.
here you go, apes.
I was thinking I could take the trauma rooms, and, uh, we could split the beds.
I can handle trauma, Alex.
it was one phone call. It doesn't mean I can't practice medicine.
I still have three great hospitals who want me.
of course they do, apes. - Don't call me apes.
Karev, come here.
you're gonna get a phone call in a few minutes, and not just any phone call.
it's from Keith Collier. - I don't know any keith Colliers.
he was one of your examiners at the boards.
Oh, crap. I failed, didn't i? They changed their minds. Son of a
Karev, karev, keith is a good friend of mine.
now whatever you told him at the boards really impressed him.
I mean, really impressed him.
he wants to offer you a peds surgery fellowship at Hopkins.
hopkins has the best program in the country.
they've already chosen their fellows for next year.
which is what makes this so extraordinary.
they're adding a position just for Karev.
this is you playing some kind of practical joke, then at the end, you're gonna tell me I learned something when I really haven't.
I - I am not joking.
I have no skin in this game.
hopkins is the dream.
I know.
it's really not cool to screw with somebody's head like this. You know that.
I know.
make sure your ringer's on.
he's full of crap.
I don't think so.
I'm over this.
Cristina, I made a decision. - Oh, you have?
you're going to Stanford. - Oh, you've made my decision.
there's no way you're going to Columbia.
and Mayo's in Minnesota. Please.
and since we're staying here, Stanford's only a couple of hours away.
you'll come up. I'll bring Zola down.
we can get drunk on the weekends.
okay, well, maybe I shouldn't bring Zola.
there you are.
is there anything you want to go over on the conjoined twins before you head out to Boise?
uh, no. I'm, uh, I'm good.
you sure? 'cause you're gonna be the sole cardiothoracic surgeon representing Seattle Grace.
which, I mean, you know, is kind of unheard of for an attending to allow her fellow to do.
but that's just the kind of faith I have in you.
technically, I'm not a fellow yet.
I know. Right?
I mean, so just think about all the things that you're gonna be able to do when you are.
tip of the iceberg, Yang. I'm proud of you.
you haven't even told her you're leaving?
I haven't decided yet where I'm going.
you just did. Stanford. - Hopkins!
uh, hopkins is not in the running.
not for you. For me. Hopkins.
hopkins wants me. Hopkins wants me.
johns hopkins, the hospital?
Alex, how? - Not hopkins refrigeration school?
I kinda bitched out their chief of surgery at my boards, and I-I-I guess he was impressed.
so they know you're a jerk? - They totally know, and they want me.
hopkins wants me.
I'm not surprised at all. - I am 100% surprised.
nice work, evil spawn.
Yes! Hopkins!
the stomach's adhered to the bowel, and look at the size of this liver.
you know, this is one for the record book.
we should be taking pictures. - Oh, we really should.
sure. Let's take a break.
wait for someone could find a camera. We got all the time in the world.
we do have all the time in the world. This is my only case today.
because it's your day off.
I'll have another day off.
I made a lunch reservation.
I even brought the crossword.
we could skip the crossword for one week.
Ohh, that's not right.
what in the name of chickens is going on here?
is it crohn's disease?
maybe it's just a mystery.
maybe lee Harvey Oswald's magic bullet's been dancing around in Mr. Steiner's intestines for 50 years.
sometimes we just never figure it out.
you marvel at the wonder of it all while you sew 'em up, and you go eat lunch.
is it a metabolic syndrome?
Oh, maybe it's autoimmune.
what did you tell Keith?
uh, finish up. - Yes, sir.
I told him I needed a day or two to think about it.
you know, I made a commitment to Robbins.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm freaking out.
what's hopkins giving salary wise? - It's competitive.
they throw in a loan-repayment package uh, moving expenses?
you did the whole Africa thing.
tell me you at least asked for an international rotation.
Oh, karev.
look, it's not like I have any leverage.
and these are two of the best programs in the country.
who both want you.
and now's the time to shake 'em down.
I mean, pit 'em against each other.
you call Hopkins back and tell 'em what you want, and then get Hunt's ass down here and give him the same demands.
what if he doesn't want to play ball?
I mean, if he doesn't have the money, he doesn't have the money.
Oh, he has the money.
and when he lies and says that he doesn't have the money, and he will lie
you're not doing your job as the chief if you don't lie
you tell him you know about his incidentals and overhead fund.
incidentals and overhead fund.
exactly.
you say those four little words, and I promise... The kingdom will be yours.
how's Julia? You impregnate her yet?
no, I was all ready to, but then lexie... Oh, she tolde me she was in love with me.
Ooh. What did you say?
I said,thank you for your candor.
thank you for your candor? - What was I supposed to do?
Oh, I don't know... Kiss her.
Julia's away on a conference. I'm not a cheater.
usually.
look, I owe it to the both of them to...
I don't want to mess this one up, okay?
Julia wants to give me everything I want.
but I'm in love with Lexie, who doesn't want anything I want.
Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Sloan. - Lexie, come on in.
plenty of room.
you know, actually, I was just gonna update you on the Boise doctors' Bios, but since you're both here, i'm just gonna give it to you, and then that way, I can... Leave.
Oh, uh, no. You guys go. I'm gonna stay.
Oh, hey, lexie, about that other thing, don't think I forgot what you said.
I just need to ruminate on that... You know? Run it up the old flagpole?
okay.
you know, it's too bad Meredith and I are moving to Boston.
I'm gonna miss this.
Hey, you got a second?
cause I cannot figure out what to do about tulane, and there's this whole other thing that happened at the boards.
I mean, it's all kinda thrown me for a loop.
Aw. Look at that. She's cute.
must be nice in here with all these cute little babies.
is she dying, like, right now?
cause Nisick.
remember Nick, your brother's best friend, your rock, who is right now packing up and bailing on a surgery that he needs to live because you can't get your stubborn head out of your ass and let go of the fact that he didn't come to you sooner?
Callie, I... - No, I don't get it.
you watch babies die every day.
when things looked bad for me, you didn't leave my side.
and now your best friend's asking for you.
look, you need to get your crap together before he leaves, because if he goes now, he is gone.
she's not actually dying, is she?
no. - Okay, good.
you said you'd know more once you got in there.
we hoped we'd know more.
unfortunately, we weren't able to find the cause.
but the good news is, we were able to repair all the damage to your abdomen.
well, what's the point if you don't know what's doing it?
something is eating my insides.
maybe it's stress, you know?
you're so worried about the worst-case scenario, you finally made it happen.
okay, coral can poison you. That's a known fact.
and look at you. I told you not to pet those monkeys.
what? It's a rash. It's not from the monkeys.
would you please take a look at her arm?
it's been there for weeks.
let me see. Uh, where did you say you honeymooned again?
thailand.
you know, where pigs walk around inside restaurants.
it's called local color. - It's unsanitary.
life is unsanitary. That's what makes it fun, for god sakes.
Mrs. Steiner, please hold still.
Oh, what is this here?
is that...Right there. - That's... A worm.
good news. I think we found what's eating your insides.
that's a nasty critter. Raw fish?
sushi in Thailand from a train station.
I'm looking for more damage. Want to help?
no. I'm gonna cancel our lunch reservation.
Oh, are you really still moping about lunch?
I had a plan. We had a date!
there is a gnathostoma worm in this man's body.
these things eat through the viscera, migrate through the tissue.
this is a once-in-a-lifetime parasite.
I'm sorry if I find it a little more interesting right now than the crossword and garden salad.
the patient is on antiparasitics.
the worm is going to die.
there's nothing else you can do right now other than go to lunch.
this is not like one of your movies where-where-where the larvae gestate in the brain, leaving the poor host a hollowed-out zombie whose bite will now infect the whole populous on the base.
what movie is that? - What?
no, that sounds good. I haven't seen it.
I made it up. - Oh, man!
you made a commitment.
technically, that was a verbal agreement. I never signed a contract.
I would like to think that your word is as good as a contract.
N- n-normally, yeah, but... This is Hopkins.
I just think you should know what they're offering me.
Oh, really, like what?
like, uh, m-moving expenses.
you live here. - True.
but this is the extra dough that Hopkins was willing to offer.
I'm just asking you to add that on to my new salary.
Karev, even if I wanted to, I couldn't.
that budget is already set.
we don't have the dough. Okay?
maybe you should recheck that budget.
you know, see what you got lying around in your, uh, incidentals and overhead fund.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I-I think you do.
Oh, we can add spaghetti wednesday to the list of things
I'm not gonna miss about this place.
are you kidding? Best deal in town.
I've watched Alex go through six bowls already. - True that.
Hey, I hear stanford has a farm-to-table chef.
you can text your order right from the O. R.
well, I'll factor that in. I still haven't made my decision.
well, it's gotta be Stanford. Where else would you go?
I don't know. I might stay.
everything's on the table.
she like-a the spaghetti, too.
tulane's got crawfish.
I mean, that's a selling point.
u. S.C.- I mean, what- What do they eat in l. a?
souls.
2-1-2. It's new york.
mount Sinal. - Answer it.
bad news is only bad news if you pick up the phone.
april kepner speaking. - Cristina.
Oh, really?
okay. Oh, my gosh. Okay. No, no, no, no. No, thank you.
they-they didn't pull my offer?
Oh, no. They did.
I just figured that's what you'd sound like in the face of rejection.
Hey, you want my fries, apes? - Not if they're pity fries.
they taste the same.
no, you still got case Western and Seattle, right?
you're gonna be... Fine.
uh, so what does Sloan think about Tulane?
he hasn't weighed in one way or the other.
there's something wrong with him. I think he's disturbed or something.
then again, I've been pretty disturbed myself these days.
2-1-6. Cleveland.
maybe case Western's offering loan assistance.
this is kepner.
Oh, yeah? Well, you know what? I am an awesome surgeon.
and I would've rocked your stupid little program so it is your loss. Go to hell!
where are you going? - Belize.
you're going to have the surgery.
why, so I can get a few more months of pain and suffering?
so you can live, and then you'll have radiation, or we'll get you in a clinical trial.
Oh, now you have an opinion, doctor, after you've been m. i.a for few days?
I've been a little busy, nick. I
look, I get that this is scary for you. I really do.
but it kinda sucks for me, too.
they're telling me i'm riddled with cancer, and I'm completely alone.
Where's your sister? Did-did you call your sister?
you're the one that's supposed to be here.
you're the one who's supposed to have my back through all this.
and you're nowhere! You're gone!
I have your back! - Then have it!
please... Please... Have the surgery.
it'll work. And I'll be here. I'll be here. I promise.
damn, phoenix.
things a guy has to do to get your attention.
I love the fireplace, the stonework.
you hated it a month ago.
and the windows.
these views are amazing. You are a genius.
I will build you a dream house in Boston.
what will we do with this one? - Mark will buy it.
his dreams have always been my dreams.
harvard is offering me a $10 million endowment.
they're setting me up with an entire research team.
I'm gonna cure alzheimer's, Meredith. That's my dream.
not this house.
you're making this choice with Cristina.
she's not the only factor. - I'm your husband.
you should make it with me.
so I didn't see any further damage from the parasite on your scans.
that's great, but you can't just leave a worm inside of him forever.
this thing has teeth. You have to get it out of me, please.
you know, I have a worm inside of me, too, but you don't hear me crying about it.
yours is in your arm, and they're taking it out today.
mine could be anywhere.
Oh, my god. My penis.
it's not gonna get to your - It doesn't do that, does it?
my legs. - Okay, well, which is it your legs or your penis?
no, I'm serious. I can't feel my legs or my arms.
it's-it's weird. It's all going numb.
what?
can you move your toes?
what about your fingers?
no. - Shoot. Okay.
can you feel that? - Barely.
what's wrong? What's happening to him?
page Shepherd. Right away, doctor.
well, the thing's gnawed through all the discs.
c-3 to c-5 are all inflamed.
so it's in there.
the worm's in his cervical spine, nesting, waiting.
so there's a chance of paralysis.
complete paralysis. I need to get in there quick.
otherwise, he's gonna be a quadriplegic.
go. I'm going in with you. I'm on your six.
I'll get him prepped. Lock and load, people.
she's on your what? - I have no idea.
okay, dealer's choice.
do you want to do the ventriculoplasty or resect the tumor or...
do you want to be primary surgeon?
fine. - Fine?
okay, what is going on?
are you staying? Are you going?
cause it-it's driving me crazy. I- I don't...
if it has to do with Owen, whatever it is, I am sure the two of you can fix it.
I'll take all of it.
what? - All of it.
the ventriculoplasty and as much of the tumor as you'll let me do.
thank you. It's very generous.
I'll see you in there.
okay, Marion, the ultrasound shows the worm went deeper into your tissue but we should still be able to get that nasty thing out.
Jake could die or he could be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I'm the one that insisted we go to thailand.
I keep trying to turn him into somebody else.
maybe we made a mistake.
what do you mean exactly? - How do you know it was a mistake?
I don't know why we keep coming back to each other.
we're the same people, but we keep expecting a different outcome.
isn't that the definition of insanity?
or love.
if there's a spark, there's a spark.
or maybe you think there's a spark, but it just happened once, so you can't really tell, and there's no time to actually figure that out because you're probably moving halfway across the country.
are we gonna get this worm out any time soon?
Yeah. Get the irrigation ready. - Right. On it.
c-3 and c-4 are just a mess.
I'm gonna have to go further in here than I expected.
you might as well go all the way to c-5.
I mean, from the look of this lesion, that's where the bastard set up his hive.
I don't want it to be any more invasive than it has to be.
don't argue with her. She's starring in her own sci-fi movie.
you mess with her, she'll pull out her ray gun and atomize your ass.
and he's still pouting. You're a physician.
is this really the first time you missed a lunch and the crossword because of a surgery?
here we go. - It was important to me.
well, this parasite's important to me.
Yeah, I can see that. - You know what?
fine. Let's do it right now. Give me the damn crossword.
just forget it.
Oh, no. Nobody's ever gonna forget it.
where is Dr. Warren's bag?
Miranda... - Oh, there it is.
and this is why you don't work with your girlfriend.
I warned them.
here we go. Oh, this is gonna be so great.
it's way better than a once-in-a-lifetime, bone-eating parasite.
let's see. One down.
Dr. Bailey. - Oh, no, no, no.
no help from you. I'm too excited. This is what I live for.
let's see "peruvian mountain range." Oh, Andes. Five, uh-huh.
uh... planet with water, four letters.
Oh, mars. Duh. Uh,"fancy sauce"?
fancy... Ooh.
Remoulade. - Stop.
what? No, no. I'm on a roll. Come on.
Hey, this can't be the sunday,'cause this is way too easy.
What's-oh, hey, this one, 21 across.
my question to you.
I'm asking you to put it away.
he's asking you nicely, dr. Bailey.
Oh, no, no, no. When he doesn't get his way, he holds on to it in his cheek like a squirrel with a nut.
we are doing the crossword.
what is "my question to you"?
it's a bunch of letters.
um... Oh, maybe it's a phrase.
my question to you," anybody?
how many letters?
uh, 2... 9... 13.
it's 13 letters? - 14.
no, I'm looking at it. It's 13.
no, it's 14. Count again.
I just counted. What, do you have x-ray vision from across the room?
"will you marry me" is my question to you.
and the reason why it's so easy is because I made the crossword.
took me two damn months not to mention getting a mockup made of the New York Times.
the phrase has 14 letters.
will," four,"you," seven,"marry," 12,"me..." 14.
got it.
it was in c-4.
all right, temp's down to 30 degrees.
Cross-clamping the aorta.
all right. Let's see what we're working with.
damn it. This wasn't in the scans.
the tumor's infiltrated much deeper into the ventricle.
reconstructive ventriculoplasty isn't gonna cut it.
we could do a fontan?
directly sew the right atrium to the pulmonary artery.
we could patch whatever's left.
that would help with blood flow, but the hole in the resection would
Yeah. He-he'd arrest right on the table.
we could do an r. v. To a p. a. Conduit
no, the thing would calcify. It would kill him.
a cadaver homograft?
uh, the hole would be way too big.
it's instant heart failure.
they don't know what to do, Callie. They have no idea.
no, it's-it's Altman and Yang, okay?
they'll figure something out.
they're gonna figure something out.
come on, guys. Come on.
Sedona. How's my ticker?
cancer free?
the tumor had taken over your heart, and there was no good way to get it out so...
they had to close up.
but I thought... You said it was my best shot.
it was.
so... I guess i'm going to Belize.
Yeah.
stupid.
I'm so freakin'... Why didn't I come sooner?
why didn't I come... Oh, my god.
I'm so stupid.
I'm so stupid.
no. No.
I'm so stupid.
I - I think we're gonna lose Yang.
Owen, what happened? Please tell me.
cause I-I have tried everything short of offering her my own job.
I mean, I've sang, I've-I've danced, I've
I slept with someone else.
so... There's nothing that you could've done.
she's not leaving you.
she's leaving me.
I'm sorry.
hopkins didn't pull the offer, did they?
they, uh, gave me the international rotation and the moving expenses, and they took care of, uh, all my loans - College, Med school.
Yes. - They're even throwing in a mortgage allowance.
I could buy a house. - Good.
they gave me everything I asked for. So did Hunt.
then... Why the hell aren't you celebrating?
no one's ever wanted me like this.
you just don't recognize the view, karev... The crowd going wild, people taking pictures, the snap of the tape as you break it.
what are you talking about?
what it looks like when you finish first.
chief, you paged? - Yeah.
uh... I can't hire you next year, kepner.
I- I'm-i'm-i'm taking my boards again.
you know, I'll-i'll pass this time.
you-you don't have to worry about that
it's not just about the boards.
I've had to do some last-minute rejiggering of my budget, and I just don't have the money
this is a top-ranking hospital. There's always money.
I- I-I can help you find it.
I'm really good with budgets.
chief... I have nothing left.
Seattle Grace was my last option.
you're not the best candidate for the job anymore.
I am sorry.
they're conjoined at the sternum and the diaphragm.
it's tricky.
I can handle it.
so Seattle's still in the mix. That's a surprise.
because of Owen?
Cristina, he should be with someone who wants a baby.
and you should be with someone who wants you.
you know what?
you and everyone else needs to just... Shut up about it.
it's a huge decision.
and I don't want you doing the wrong thing.
it is not your decision to make.
I am your person.
we're not married. You're not my...
he's my person.
Hey. I just checked in on him.
his vitals are stable.
he's sleeping.
don't ever leave.
what? - Don't... Ever leave.
promise me that right now.
I'm not going anywhere. I promise.
after my brother... I thought, I can't do this ever again.
I won't... Do this again.
and now here I am.
okay, whatever you can't do, I will.
I'm here.
and that's how this works, okay?
come here.
so what's it gonna be, columbia, stanford?
I hear that Mayo is back in the mix.
you know, really, you - You can't go wrong with any of them, so...
what-what are you- What are you doing?
propose to me again.
baby, you should sit down.
propose to me... Again.
Wow. I mean, you - You look...
Miranda, I would love nothing more than that, - but I'm telling you, you should... - Oh, for the love of god, man,
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry I messed up your proposal, but...
I'm wearing a thong, and this is as sorry as I get, so...
come on. Ask me to marry you.
okay, look, th-there was the shooting, right?
and then you and I broke up, and I-I just- I wanted to get outta here, to do something different, something... Inspiring.
I - I just... Didn't think it would actually happen.
um... I got a call, and... I've been accepted as a surgical intern at U. C.L. A.
an intern, Miranda, working seven days a week... 1, 000 miles away.
everything's different now.
what?
I'm happy.
I know... This doesn't fix anything... But I'm just happy.
I'm leaving.
you got that? Is it too heavy for you?
no, I'm-i'm fine, but thank you.
no, uh, thank you.
you son of a bitch. I had to hear it from hunt?
what, you couldn't even be man enough to tell me yourself?
sweetie. She's had a horrible day. I'm so s
no, you ungrateful crap dog! - It's Hopkins. You went there.
you of all people should know that.
you are a miserable, miserable bastard.
Robbins, they want me.
all right? They really want me.
Oh, well, you... You're actually going?
can we talk about this when I get back?
No! - What are you doing?
no, you are not going to Boise, because you no longer represent this hospital!
look at Alex, showing us all up by going to Hopkins.
if Robbins lets him live that long.
I'm going to Boston. I told Hunt.
I'm going to Mayo.
I don't know how those birds do it...
travel thousands of miles without getting lost...
banging into windows, being eaten by cats.
all right, let's get you some water, okay?
Oh... Let's get you some water.
you know, I'm so sick of everyone being so damn nice to me.
you just feel guilty... - April...
for having sex with me... - Oh, no, come on. That is not...
and then I failed...And now no one wants me.
what? Oh, crap. Even Seattle?
I don't want your pity, okay?!
can you just leave me alone?
can you do that? I'm-i'm fine. I'm fine.
okay. I'm gonna be fine, Jackson.
all right. April, April... Come...
but every spring, they're always here.
I guess they come back to what they know.
people say it's pretty cool watching them go.
they say you can actually see the moment...
when, at some mysterious signal... all at once...
the birds decide to leave.
so maybe I've been missing out.
whatever.
there's always next year.
a month ago, you were in medical shool been told by doctors.
today...
you are the doctors.
the seven years you spend here as a surgical resident, will be the best and worst of your life.
you will be pushed to the breaking point.
eight of you will switch to an easier specialty.
five of you will crack under the pressure.
two of you will be asked to leave.
this is your starting line.
this is your arena.
how well you play, that's up to you.
get up! You have to get up now!
Meredith! Get up!
Oh, god.
I... How long was I out?
I don't-I... I don't know. I lost my- I lost my shoe.
Where's - Where's Derek and Lexie?
I don't... I don't know. I lost a shoe.
what happened? - The plane crashed, that's what happened.
we were in a plane, and it crashed. Plane crash.
where is Derek?!
Cristina, where is Derek?
he was sucked out the side when we hit the trees, and then the back of the plane came off. It came-it came off.
Lexie was in the back of the plane.
I - I looked to the back, and all I could see was freakin' sky.
where is she? - I don't know! I only have one shoe!
I'm bleeding.
shut up! Shut up!
do you hear - Do you hear that sound? Where is that sound coming from?
there.
it's coming from over there.
is somebody there?
Oh, y-I'm-I'm here. I'm here.
I can't... I can't...I'm-I'm stuck in here.
Oh, don't do that. Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
I - I can't get outta here.
what's your name? - Jerry.
Jerry, I'm arizona. I don't want you to move, okay?
cause you could-you could injure yourself more.
the controls just...I... I think one of the engines quit.
is... Is anybody else alive?
um... Yeah.
Yeah, we're all alive. Well, I-I... I- I think we're all alive.
you're all surgeons.
what's funny?
I am, um, I'm married to an orthopedic surgeon and I'm staring at my bone.
and it's not-it's not funny.
I- I think I'm in a little bit of sh-sh-shock.
okay. - But really, I'm fine.
it's okay. If I could just get myself to stop laughing.
yeah? Yeah?
I can't feel my legs.
Yeah, I knew that was bad.
Lexie. Lexie. - I knew you'd show up.
how is she? - She's awake and responsive.
how you doing in there?
I'm-I'm great.
yeah? Good girl. We're gonna get you outta here, okay?
okay.
she's tachycardic and short of breath.
we have to find Derek.
okay, you know what? We've got lexie. So go. Go find him.
go, go. Go try and find him.
we gotta get her outta there.
pop it back in.
Ah. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
okay, do it.
Oh, god! Oh!
sir. - Have you seen Dr. Altman?
no, but, um, sir, you have a few messages.
is anybody dying? - no.
is it Dr. Yang? - no.
then send all calls to voice mail.
I have multiple traumas coming in. I don't have time. And find me Altman.
all right. Where do you want me, chief?
incoming. Building collapsed on a bunch of firefighter recruits.
last day of their training. Happy graduation.
okay, well, you have me till 7: 00.
I've got a dinner with the last group of residents tonight.
I do not understand why you're spending your week taking the residents out to dinner.
Aw, come on, Hunt. It's a tradition. We're celebrating a milestone.
you're welcome to join. - I'll pass.
Oh, I'm telling you, it's an evening you won't forget, and the kids, they just love it.
could someone please mercy kill me so I don't have to go to this thing?
you do me, I'll do you.
better leave me a bullet. Hell if I'm going alone.
yang and Grey skipped town at the perfect time.
Oh, no, they will be back in time for the dinner.
because I had to pick up their stupid dry cleaning and
and dig through their stupid closets for their stupid heels, all the while babysitting Mer's stupid kid.
she's not stupid. She's actually adorable.
Hey, you decide on Tulane yet?
no, I'm still weighing my options.
lot of factors involved.
at least you have options.
Hey, want to hear mine? When I go back to Moline, do I work at the tastee freez or milk cows on the farm?
tastee freeze. No-brainer.
you're still a doctor.
just go to Tulane already.
it's a thing. People are together, but they live apart.
live-apartners." It's common enough to have a name.
syphilis is common enough to have a name.
doesn't mean I want it.
who doesn't want what?
somebody has gotten themselves a surgical internship in Los Angeles.
I'm branching out. - Congratulations. Or not.
we wouldn't be the first commuter marriage on the planet.
you're getting married? Oh, that's fantastic.
okay, you should probably leave while you can.
I'm going. Because my love is strong enough to handle the space.
long-distance relationship? Not the end of the world.
no. Absence makes the sex grow hotter.
arizona's only been gone for one night, and already, she's inspired a totally hot "I miss you thing" when she gets back.
I have lingerie and flavored body paint... - Oh, there is a god.
okay, ready? On my count. One, two...
three.
again. One, two, three.
damn it!
Lexie, run it down for me.
my legs and my pelvis are crushed.
and I can't f-feel my other arm, so I'm not sure it's even there anymore.
and, uh, my chest feels like it's gonna explode, so it's probably a massive... Hemothorax.
Oh, oh, we- we gotta- we gotta get the oxygen from the plane. Okay?
and fluids. Fluids. She needs water bottles.
and, uh, uh, the tubes, the oxygen tubes.
we can get her fluids.
we can get her fluids, okay? Go get 'em.
go. Go get 'em. Go get 'em.
why aren't you doing anything?
she... She knows it won't help.
no. no. You are gonna be fine.
stop. You're gonna be fine.
go! Get 'em!
I'm gonna be right back.
I've got a lot of free fluid in the upper right quadrant.
somebody call c. t. - Right away, doctor.
open femur in two. - Strong pulse. He's good.
I need those chest films, please. What's up?
I just got a call from Rita Simon this morning.
Really? I-I haven't heard from Rita since Baghdad.
Yeah, I was surprised, too, especially when she asked me if I knew if you were taking the chief job at Medcom.
I - I was gonna tell you.
but you didn't.
I've already lost the head of neuro to Harvard, and now I have to find a new head of cardio on top of everyone else?
I'm not taking the job. I - I just haven't had time to tell Medcom.
what, what do you mean, you're... - Let's get him ready for c. t.
I'm gonna try and splint this. - No, I can do it. I can do it.
uh, Jerry needs c - spine stabilization.
who's Jerry?
how are you doing there, Jerry?
I give us four hours tops before they find us.
there's a transmitter in the plane that lets out a squawk that should lead 'em right to us.
did you find Derek?
uh, not yet. Uh, jerry, uh, do you, uh, have any tape?
uh, yeah. In the bulkhead.
in the cabinet to your left.
there's a flare gun in there, too. You hear a chopper, you fire it straight up.
and Lexie? - Not good.
Oh, great. Great, great, great, great, great.
okay, keep your head very still.
Yeah. Okay. - Good, good.
Jerry... is there a first aid kit?
a - yeah, a big one.
in the cabinet on your right, behind the cockpit.
there's no cabinet there.
just tell her to hang on for another four hours.
great.
Hey, hey, wait. Don't leave!
I - I can't feel my legs. That's because I'm trapped, right?
I mean, I'm gonna be okay, right?
I'm not paralyzed. I'm gonna walk again. I'm gonna be okay, right?
I'm sorry.
I can't find him. I looked everywhere.
I can't find him. - Maybe he's fine.
maybe he went for help.
maybe, but I gotta - I gotta keep looking.
no, Meredith.
you should come... Help Lexie.
you're doing good. - Mark...
Cristina's... Cristina's gonna be back any minute.
mark... - She's gonna be back, and we're gonna get you stabilized, and you're gonna be fine, okay?
mark... - Just a few minutes, okay?
she'll be back any minute.
mark... I'm... I'm dying.
what? No, you're not.
I am.
please... tell... tell Meredith that I love her.
and that she's a good sister.
Mm. Please t-tell my dad...
you're not dying. You're gonna be fine.
hold my hand.
I'm not holding your hand because you're not dying.
hold my hand.
no. You're not dying.
do you hear me? You don't die today.
I love you.
you don't have to say it because I said it.
I do. I love you. I love you. I've always been in love with you.
I will always be in love with you.
yeah? - Yeah.
which is why you have to stay alive.
we- we- we're gonna get married.
and you're gonna make an amazing surgeon.
and we're gonna have two or three kids.
so Sofia can have siblings.
Yeah. A sister and two brothers.
and... that's nice.
we're gonna be happy, Lex... You and me.
we're gonna have the best life, Lexie, you and me.
we're gonna be so happy.
so you can't die, okay?
you can't die, because we're supposed to end up together.
we're meant to be.
meant to be.
I love you. I love you. I - I love you.
I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.
your wife is bonkers. - Yeah, but she's cute.
no, she pulled me off every single peds case before she left.
she's punishing me for choosing Hopkins. - Ouch.
you know what? I don't care. I'm calling her right now.
Hey, Karev, no. Put that phone away. No good's gonna come out of that.
I'm pissed. - Yeah, well, so is she.
you know why? 'cause she loves you. She'll get over it.
the best thing you can do is just leave it alone.
wait till she come back. Talk to her tomorrow when you've both calmed down.
if you got nothing to do, scrub in with me. I've got an open femur.
Oh, there you are.
why tomorrow? I thought she was coming back tonight.
uh, tonight I've got things planned that don't include her screaming your name.
will you at least tell me why? - Why what?
why you turned down the job at Medcom. - No.
tell me. - no.
somebody want to tell me what Medcom is?
it would make this a whole lot more fun for me.
army Medical Command.
they oversee every medical operation in the U. S. and in Europe.
fancy. - Very.
she'd be instructing, innovating surgical field techniques, and they're interested in funding her stem cell research.
sounds like a good fit.
it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I just don't understand
so what, now you're pissed that I'm not leaving?
Where's your loyalty?
you're being asked to serve your country.
do you know where we are right now, Hunt?
this is the room where my husband died.
right here on this table.
and no matter how many wonderful and amazing and miraculous things happen in this room, it will always be the room where my husband died.
and the south elevator will always be the place where I met him, and-and the cafeteria will always be the place where he bought my lunch.
I would love to leave here and never look back.
but you are as beaten and broken as I have ever seen you.
and after everything that I have put you through, the tolerance and kindness...
and friendship that you have shown me,
I am not going to leave you because of my loyalty.
I am not going to leave here for Medcom or anywhere else.
this isn't holding. 3-0 prolene, please.
I don't understand how this keeps happening.
Cristina, we have to find him. - I'm serious.
I do not understand how this keeps happening.
we have to find him, because I don't think he went for help.
we keep dying. We're in a plane crash, Mer. Like-like right now.
if he went for help, if Derek had gone for help, he would've sent a message or something.
I mean, we have to find him. Something is wrong.
I can tell you one thing. When we get out of here,
I am getting the hell away from seattle grace mercy death, and I'm never looking back!
Cristina... I think Derek is dead.
he would've come for us by now.
he definitely would've come for us by now.
I think he's dead. And Lexie's dead.
my husband and sister are both dead!
and we are gonna die out here, too!
we are gonna die out here... - Keep it together. Keep it together.
no, you keep it together! - I'm trying!
I know. Keep - Keep it together anyway.
keep it together anyway.
my sister is dead. - Keep it together anyway.
do you think Derek is dead?
I don't know. Maybe.
but I've got p. t. s. d. so you know I'm not reliable.
Cristina... You are still my person, even if I'm not yours.
Oh, I heard your voice.
I thought I - I thought I was dreaming.
Oh, my god.
Oh, I found it! - The first aid box?
my shoe.
is she gonna be okay?
she's not barefoot anymore.
well, I guess that's something.
okay. - Where's Lexie?
no?
okay, let's just keep it together, okay?
okay.
clothes.
loosen the tourniquet a little bit.
you'll bleed to death. - I need to save my hand.
well, I'm trying to save your life.
Oh, safety pin. Safety pin. - Bring that.
do you have a t-shirt or a bandana?
got it. Got it.
okay, we have to close the wound.
use the safety pin.
weave your way inside and out and then put the bandana on top of it and tape it.
and what's the- What's the t-shirt for?
put it in my mouth. I'm probably gonna scream a lot, and I'm gonna-I'm gonna- I'm gonna pass out.
good. - Okay.
I am sorry, sorry.
please pass out. Please pass out.
Kepner, you'll have to close up for me.
I have to preorder our duck- Uh, slow-roasted, it takes six hours, falls off the bone.
Oh, the residency dinner. Can I come?
Oh, you've had your turn. Now it's theirs.
you kids jazzed about dinner?
Yes, sir.
Oh, very jazzed. - Yum.
well, call me Miles Davis, cause I'm jazzed.
I'll give you 10 bucks to stab me in the face right now.
now I know why you were trying so hard to keep her here.
if Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job.
I'll be fine. - No, no, Owen, you won't.
you are losing the love of your life.
Yeah. Everywhere I look, I expect to see her.
she's not even gone, and I miss her already.
I wish I could tell you that will go away, but it won't.
matches. Yes, god. Finally.
fire. We can build a fire.
we should. They'll see a fire.
let's get a fire started.
Yeah, Mark. We need - We need to start a fire.
you have to help.
I - I'll figure out how to get it started.
no, no. You know what? He doesn't get to do this.
he doesn't get to stop helping.
I'm sorry he lost Lexie, but she was your sister, and you're still helping.
he has to help because the sky is falling, mark.
Cristina. - No, no, no.
you know, if there's one thing that I've learned with all the the bombs and the guns to my head and and the buses running down my friends is that I am not interested in dying.
I want to get out of here, and I want to go home.
and everyone has to help.
mark, get up. Get up and help, Mark. Get up.
what happened?
when I rechecked him, he had muffled heart sounds and j. v.d.
delayed tamponade? - It's a cardiac tamponade.
are you sure?
well, if you want me to be sure, get me an ultrasound.
will you man the ultrasound?
thank you.
looks like the pericardium's about to burst.
we have to drain his pericardial sac and relieve the pressure, or-or his heart will stop.
with what? We don't even have an 18-guage spinal needle.
all right. 18 gauge.
okay, I got it. Okay.
hold this. Take the top off.
okay. Why? - Use that right there. Use the tube.
brilliant. Brilliant. - Okay, this will work.
sanitize that.
is the tubing long enough?
I'm going in, um, subxiphoid. Knife.
okay, needle.
here. Here you go, Mer.
all right, Mark. Try not to move.
easy, Mark. It's okay. Don't move. It's gonna be okay.
aim for his left shoulder.
wait. Don't puncture his heart. - I know, I know, I know.
careful. Don't puncture the heart. - I know.
okay.
deeper!
good. Excellent. That's it. That's it. That's it. Great.
very good. It's gonna be okay.
that's good. That's it. That's exactly it.
you did it. Just let it drain into here.
Oh, you did it. You got it.
I got it. I got the bag. - You got it.
there.
wanna go for lunch?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
eating. - No. No. You have a dinner tonight.
the-the biggest dinner of your lives.
here's the thing, I can't eat duck.
I had a duck on the farm. It lived in the house.
so order the steak.
here's the thing, I had a cow... - Look, no one really wants to go tonight.
he's preordering the duck.
come on. Where's-where's your sense of occasion?
in Baltimore at Hopkins.
Webber and I have issues. Oh, he knows what he did.
I failed my boards. I have nothing to celebrate.
Oh, boo-hoo. Oh, poor April didn't pass her test.
big whoop, okay?
I got fired from chief resident, then I got fired from this hospital.
Oh, my husband cheated on me.
what?- you were married to a man?
and then he died.
so I didn't think I was gonna ever be happy again.
but now my life is pretty damn great.
so you're having a rough time. It's nothing.
it's a blip.
and in the meantime, you're missing your moment.
you survived residency.
stop and celebrate that.
cause life... changes in an instant.
it turns on a dime.
one minute you're miserable, and then the next...
you've met the most amazing woman in the world and are in love.
this moment, your moment, it only happens once.
Oh, and the duck is freakin' amazing.
what happened? - Tamponade.
mer did a pericardiocentesis.
Oh, my god. - He's holding on for now.
Where's Lexie?
Where's Lexie?
Lexie's dead.
so we should get a fire started.
Oh, I've got - I've got the matches.
we have five left.
make it big so they see.
what happened to the four hours, Jerry?
it's been more than four hours.
listen. - What does that mean?
I mean, does that mean that they're not coming for us?
I mean, you said four hours. You said four hours tops.
Ch-chopper!
Oh, my god. It's a helicopter! Hey!
help!
where is it? I don't see it. I don't see it.
get the flare gun! The flare gun! - In the bag! In the bag!
Oh, god, shoot it!
why isn't it working? - Shoot it again! Shoot it again!
give it to me.
help! - Oh, my god, no!
Oh, my god. No, no! Come back!
no, no, no!
I chose Tulane.
good.
that's good for you.
Yeah.
I feel sick, by the way.
sick to leave here, to leave you.
but, um, but I'm glad-I'm glad you're so friggin' happy about it.
I'm not.
I'm not happy with any of it.
I'm not happy that everything I thought I was turns out not to be true.
um, I'm not a board-certified surgeon.
I'm not a virgin. I'm not a good christian.
I don't know what I am, but I know I'm not happy.
I loved having sex with you.
you made me feel things... You changed me, Jackson.
and I loved that.
but I hate that I'm not a virgin for the man I'm gonna marry.
I'm not freakin' happy about that.
and I'm really not happy that you feel bad about it, cause you're my best friend.
but you know what?
Torres is right.
my problems will still be my problems tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that.
and in a few weeks, my best friend will be at Tulane, and I may never see him again, so...
for one night, I'm just gonna forget all about that.
and I'm gonna try.
I'm gonna try to be happy.
I'm happy tonight.
I am gonna be happy, Jackson, cause this is a happy time, and we should be celebrating, okay?
so can you please just wipe that freakin' frown off your face and be happy with me?
you look really nice.
so do you.
this is Dr. Robbins. Leave me your name and number, and I'll get right back to you. Thanks.
Hey, um, it's Alex. Listen, um...
look, the only reason Hopkins wants me is because you made me something.
all right, you made me, and I still don't know why.
you said one time that you saw something in me, and I mean, most of me thinks you're nuts, but...
I gotta go to Hopkins cause I gotta see if I'm something when you're not there, holding my hand, you know?
I guess I'm saying thanks or whatever.
I - I don't know.
if you want to be pissed about it, then be pissed about it.
Bye.
Hey, they don't know where we are.
they don't know where we are.
it's because the transmitter's probably been damaged in the crash.
if the transmitter's damaged... - We could be here for days.
Yeah.
Owen has got to have figured out we're missing.
I know he sent someone.
I shoulda said it earlier... that I loved her.
I shoulda said it earlier.
she... She knew.
I think she knew.
she didn't know.
she didn't know.
mark... Mark, hold on.
okay, I need you - I need you to hold on.
you'll be okay.
you don't need me.
you take care of our girls.
no. Shut up.
shut up. Do you hear me? Shut up.
Lexie's waiting for me.
I'll be okay.
No! Mark sloan, no! hey! No.
no. Sofia's waiting for you, and Callie is waiting for you, and I am waiting for you.
we're gonna go home together, okay?
okay.
okay.
thank you.
Hey. You were looking for me?
we need to talk. - no. We don't.
I am happy to stay. It'll be fun. It'll be like old times. Like you and me back in Iraq.
you're fired.
that's good. - Effective immediately.
hunt... - I wish it were different, but this is just the way things are shaking out.
now I know you have other opportunities, so if you need to make those phone calls, then
Owen, stop it. Stop it. You can't just do this. You can't- You can't just
I can and I did.
you can't just... - I already emailed the board.
you're already... - You can't just tell me when to go and when to stay!
I don't want you here anymore!
you shoulda seen this coming.
for months, for months, you have been disruptive in the o. r. - you have been hostile and insubordinate... - Oh, my god.
to me in front of staff and in front of students.
I can't have that. I am the chief of surgery.
Owen, I-I was-I was- I was...
we're past all of that. We are, because you're fired.
it's a done deal. Pack your stuff.
you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch! Damn it.
you don't lose her. You fight. You fight for her. You hear me?
you go.
and you be great.
you don't get to make decisions on your own without a heads-up anymore.
you don't say,"uh, oh, maybe "I'll apply to be an intern,"we'll see how it goes.
I'll bring it up with Miranda if anything comes of it, "but for now, it's my little secret between me and me.
that's not your life anymore.
when you are sharing your life with a person, you talk to them, you think with them, you make decisions with them, you are loyal to them.
you are not a free agent anymore.
do you understand me?
does this mean we're still getting married?
well, what do you... I proposed to you!
in a trench coat and a thong, proving once again that no good can ever come from a thong, but here I am, proposing again.
what, you want a skywriter?
it was clear with the coat and the thong.
you know what?
you put a piece of string in your tail and see if you want to do it twice.
you know, this may be the most romantic conversation of my life.
well, I'm not proposing romance, mister.
you love me, don't you? - I am... very angry with you.
so pissed, you're just gonna marry me, just to spite me.
Yes. Exactly.
tell me it's gonna be okay.
it's gonna be wonderful.
good morning, Dr. Hunt. This is Dr. Sheehan over at Boise memorial.
I just wanted to double-check what time your surgeons were set to arrive today.
okay.
Dr. Hunt, Dr. Sheehan again.
still no word from your surgeons.
I'm gonna check in with the airport to see if the weather held 'em up.
uh, any word from Yang or Grey?
no. Plane should've landed an hour ago.
they'll show.
well, you know... there's a little bit of advice I like to give at these dinners every year.
it's a secret that will help all of you get through the challenges that lie ahead.
you know, um... we should wait for the rest of them.
this is Dr. Sheehan again.
we're starting to get a bit concerned here.
I'm hungry.
think of something else.
I'm hungry.
I have a stick of gum.
I don't want gum. I want food.
shoot.
great. We have one match left.
Hey. No sleeping. You have to stay awake.
okay.
Derek. Derek. You, too. I want everyone conscious!
Mer, light the match.
careful. It's our last one.
okay.
the years we spend as surgical residents will be the best and worst of our lives.
we will be pushed to our breaking point.
this is the starting line.
this is our arena.
how well we play, that's up to us.
dying changes everything.
there's the emotional fallout, sure.
but there's also the practical stuff.
who's going to do your job?
who's going to take care of your family?
the only good thing for you is, you don't have to worry about it.
people you never knew will be living in your house, working your job.
the world just keeps on going... without you.
Steph, i need a favor.
I'll do your scut for a week
two weeks- and before you say no, i just want to say that you look really pretty today.
and you're the most talented intern in our class, and i'm in no way trying to butter you up so you don't say no. no.
you don't even know what i'm asking you yet.
Yes, i do. i'm not going anywhere near medusa for you.
I want to live so i will say it again-no.
how is yang, by the way? does she like minnesota?
she loves it.
Dr. parker.
and that was before i realized... dr. parker.
that there was a tumor in there.
I mean, we had spent, uh, three hours trying to deal with the valve
Dr. parker. oh, dr. yang. you've gotta hear about this case dr. thomas had
must be what, ten years ago? yeah.
um, i looked at the oberman baby's scans.
uh, i know we discussed doing a thoracotomy, but i think a v. a.t. s. makes more sense.
fantastic. but let dr. thomas tell you about this story first.
you're not gonna believe your ears.
how about i scrub in with you and then i can tell you the whole story?
when's your surgery? 11: 00.
Oh, that won't work. i have a bypass at 11: 00.
why don't you move your surgery back and then i can join you?
uh, that's really not necessary.
and then you will be able to, uh, watch my 11: 00.
it's a port-cabg. have you ever seen one?
I've done one. three in fact.
well, then you'll appreciate my approach.
it's even better. well, wait a minute.
where are you going? my ambulance isn't here yet.
I can start the story now.
the patient was 66.
although i suppose i should start when i first met the man.
just wanted to let you know, we're all set for tonight.
unless you had some questions or concerns.
I don't.
okay. um...
18991231 0: 05: 00
okay.
how often should her calcium levels be monitored? every 12 hours.
and what's the primary cause of hypocalcemia after parathyroid surgery?
Really?
are you telling me not one of you knows that- hungry bone syndrome...
where calcium and phosphorus are rapidly deposited into the bone.
you're not supposed to be here.
got a last-minute flight. couldn't pass it up.
you aren't on call tonight? not anymore. i switched shifts.
what's your turnaround this time?
12 hours. and i plan to make use of every single one.
I mean, he says he's ready.
and his nerve graft seems to be ready.
so i guess today's the day he's gonna operate...
with his brand-new hand.
and it is gonna work. it's definitely gonna work.
you think it's gonna work, right? i thought i might find you in here.
I keep thinking if i say something big enough or... shocking enough, he'll just- he'll open his eyes.
7 hours till 5: 00.
his directive was very specific.
if, after 30 days, there are no signs of recovery, mark wanted to be let go.
that's all we're doing...
honoring his wish.
I know. i just...
Oh, god. it's so hot in here.
I think i'm gonna take off my shirt. oh, yeah. that's better.
Oh, yeah, it's so much cooler with my boobs out.
well, if that didn't wake him, i don't know what will.
Yeah.
you always had to be the first.
you are a terrible best man.
Addison's great, but one woman for the rest of your life?
it's not what god intended. especially for men who look like us.
God intended for us many, many women, a staggering number of women.
I just hope you didn't forget the rings.
Derek... you're lucky to have me.
you will never, ever find another friend as good as me, ever.
Hey, are you filming this?
okay, we're not doing this, okay? i'm not gonna be in one of your videos...
so you can put it on your creepy bookcase with all your other creepy videos.
there's no bookcase.
and i've never done this either, but trust me, what's about to happen, you're gonna want to relive over and over.
one second.
uh, the intern appy- you got your guy?
I have someone in mind.
and you really want to do this today? especially today.
okay. uh, grey. hey.
um, i need you to take my 3: 00 lap chole.
Oh, i can't. i have the intern appy.
Grey, living up to your nickname.
nickname? i have a nickname?
uh, they call you medusa...
the serpent-haired monster who turns folks to stone.
Hey, this is not a bad thing.
you want to be the attending with the scary nickname. it keeps your residents in line.
it strikes fear in their heart.
take it from the nazi, it's good to be feared.
you retired the nazi. they call you something else now.
they do? they do.
excuse me, dr. parker, quick question. okay, hands up, everybody.
one, two, three.
what can we do for you, dr. yang?
Oh, i-i didn't mean for you to stop your procedure. you can just keep going while i talk.
we can't, actually.
we find that multitasking leads to errors in hearing and errors in healing.
okay. uh, well, um, dr. thomas invited himself onto my v. a.t. s. this afternoon- the oberman baby. mm-hmm.
I was wondering if i could do the procedure on my own, without him.
how come?
uh, well... dr. thomas is a big talker and
Oh, my gosh. that is the truth.
Dr. thomas can chew your ear right off.
I- i tell you, once he cornered me with a story, i was on my way to the gentlemen's room.
I hate to invoke potty humor, but i wasn't sure i was gonna make it.
that's how long the story was. exactly. so
my advice to you is, visit the ladies room before you enter his proximity. yes.
I will, but another solution would be if he just didn't scrub in.
you've got a tough row to hoe there, dr. yang. no doubt about it.
thankfully, you're a tough cookie. you're up to the task.
we salute you.
guess what. i have a nickname.
Medusa. i'm medusa grey.
I had to push my flight tonight.
okay. it's not what you're thinking. it's not like last time or the time before that.
my surgery got pushed. that's it. i'm on standby for a later flight.
it's okay if you're not ready to fly.
I said i'd come. n't make it by 5: 00 anyway, so why push yourself?
I will be there, medusa.
Oh, so you did hear me? i like it.
snakes in the hair-hot! okay, bye.
Cristina's coming tonight?
she'll never make it by 5: 00, but she says she's gonna be here.
she's not gonna get on that plane, is she?
we're working on it. probably not.
before you get out i want you to know you really doing the intern appy?
jealous? he's too busy just doing the interns.
are you gonna say good-bye to your fan club before you leave? i've been saying good-bye all day.
nice. gross.
they're gonna be sad to see me go.
you may have to step up, avery. comfort them a little.
no sloppy seconds for me, thank you. you're a surgical fellow.
might as well enjoy the perks. besides, you need to get laid.
you haven't banged anybody since lexie.
sorry, mer.
I- i have...
banged people. i'm screwed.
as long as medusa's my attending, i will never get to see the inside of an o. r.
unless you're the patient.
don't be alarmed, but medusa's walking over here.
depending on her mood, i may have to pretend i don't know you.
good afternoon, everyone.
as you all probably already know, we have a tradition here.
the honor of performing your first surgery is reserved for the intern who shows the most promise.
Dr. wilson.
congratulations, you're scrubbing in.
freedom is what you do with what you got soda coming out your nose.
he has an unstable fracture.
I need to do a fuse in here and he
any numbness or tingling around the median nerve?
not- i'm good to go, torres. you did a great job.
and you'll need your i. d. card to access the scan rooms.
Hi. uh, this is mel barnett. he'll be joining us from miami.
peds surgery. i'm the new attending.
and you are? i'm derek shepherd, uh, neuro.
nice to meet you. nice meeting you. callie torres, ortho.
Oh, right.
uh, i am so sorry, uh, about your wife. i mean, i heard, and, uh
thank you. okay, uh...
how about i show you the nicu? yeah.
let's not make a big deal.
listen...
I wish i could put them off so you and i could spend more time together, but i already postponed hopkins once.
Oh, my god.
just go-get out. get out. i'm sorry.
I said get out. are you okay?
get out, okay? get out. get out.
you're gonna thank me for this, avery, when you've rewatched it for the 500th time trying to figure out how to line up your vertical mattress sutures as perfectly as i can.
now pan up to my face.
you see that? not a drop of sweat.
you know why? 'cause i'm that good.
now go get scrubbed. you're gonna finish up here. wait. really?
hurry. before i change my mind.
and i finished the reconstruction we talked about on the young mastectomy patient, uh, and the result is full sloan.
I mean, she is gonna look a scale hotter than god intended.
uh, and grandpa's labs came back.
stable. um, scarring is gonna be a problem, obviously.
but the result is pretty good considering.
and you think we can do better. i don't know. reconstruction?
that's pretty radical for a guy his age.
no, you're right. we can do better.
Hey, i wish you could see the surgery i'm watching.
it is a train wreck. so you're not gonna make it by 5: 00.
do you want to facetime or skype or something?
it's kind of weird that you're not gonna be here. oh, look at that.
he turned a port-cabg into a sternotomy. why?
Why? because this surgeon is 103.
because everyone in this frozen tundra is too damn polite to say, "hey, retire, old man, before you kill someone with your brittle, bony hands.
I'm sorry. would you mind taking that outside? i'm trying to take notes.
Yeah, well, there's nothing to learn here.
he's just poking holes in a guy's pericardium.
he'll never come off bypass.
I just wish you were gonna be here.
Owen e-mailed me today, wanted to make sure i had people around me tonight.
I don't know why everyone is so worked up about 5: 00.
I mean, mark is still gonna be gorked no matter when my plane lands.
Oh, for piss sake. he's doing another graft.
talk about lipstick on a pig.
Hey, whoever that is better have something important for me...
cause i'm a busy woman.
I'm sorry, dr. bailey. it's your intern- shane ross.
you left me with mrs. coggins, and her c. t. scans just came back
slide it under the door.
Oh, shoot. he did. hold on. hold on.
Yeah, uh, yeah, she has a small... hematoma.
um, just monitor it closely.
only you can make a small hematoma sound sexy.
crazy. ahh.
did you hear that? i didn't hear anything.
B. c.b.'s at it again. yeah, she is.
wait. hold on. hold on. be right back.
Alex karev. right.
uh, hunt mentioned that robbins really liked you.
Mel barnett. here from miami. oh, the new peds guy.
you're headed to? uh, hopkins, fellowship. leaving tonight.
that's right. great program.
so is this, by the way. hunt's been filling me in.
Oh, did he, uh, tell you about our exchange program yet?
we brought over 32 kids from 5 different countries in africa. hunt did mention the program, dr. karev.
admirable work, but i'm afraid it doesn't fit with my agenda.
we operate on sick orphans. how does that not fit your agenda?
not to worry. i've already reached out to u. c.l. a.
the program will continue, just... not here.
if you'll excuse me, i'm trying to close on a house.
welcome back.
I had nothing to do with this. okay. i had a little to do with this.
well, thank you, everyone. thank you very much.
it's really no big deal.
what? you have to say it.
it's a beautiful day to save lives.
there's no way she pulls this off.
she might, as long as she doesn't look up at medusa during the surgery.
Yeah, that face will calcify her. do you think medusa's always been medusa?
probably. i heard her mom was even worse.
Yeah, but...
that doesn't give her an excuse to act like a demon from the depths of hell itself.
it's like she can hear us. yeah, that little red light...
means the intercom is on.
now sit up straight.
I don't think that you're a demon. focus on what you're doing.
there it is. look at that.
God, i needed this.
it feels so good to finally have my hands on a problem i can fix.
Hey, thanks for...
nelson is on standby. let's have him come finish.
Derek, just take a second. just- i'll meet you in post-op.
I had a patient once who told me about his wedding day and how they asked all the married couples to come to the dance floor to dance together.
and then they asked the couples who'd been only married a year to sit down.
and then five years, then ten years, 20, and so on, until they got to the last two couples.
uh, two sets of grandparents.
been together 60 years.
60 years with the love of their life.
that's gonna be you two at our granddaughter's wedding.
Congratulations. i love you.
what about you? won't you be dancing at your granddaughter's wedding?
gotta have a partner for that.
well, if you had a partner, who would it be?
Oh, well, that's easy. lexie grey.
Dr. torres. uh, not a good time.
Hey, look, the new guy, uh, barnett, he's shipping the-the orphan program over to u. c.l. a.
Yeah, really not a good time.
I'm leaving, so i'm not gonna be able to do anything about it, and i know-i know dr. robbins wouldn't want this happen. oh, alex.
maybe you could just talk - no, what? what? what? just what?
I'm up to my eyeballs trying to save things around here, and your peds program really doesn't mean that much to me, okay?
sometimes things die, alex, and there's nothing you can do about it.
told you, not a good time.
appendix is out.
Whoo! all right.
you're not finished.
I know. next i...
pull up on the purse strings and invert the stump into the cecum.
Oh, no. okay, you ripped the cecum wide open.
what's next? um...
Wilson, you have to think, quickly. come on. what's next?
think.
go in and grab your purse strings. b. p. is dropping.
your patient is in trouble. go.
okay, move. clamp.
irrigation.
irrigation. suction over here.
I know why you favor a less-invasive approach.
but, you know, you're a creature of your generation.
I mean, you believe in 30-second rice and instant oatmeal and the-the, uh, news brief.
well, no.
you're-you're looking for the-for the bullet, the memo, the text.
okay. um, but- lol. omg. ha!
okay, well, as i said, i will open him up, but he's a baby, so there's only room for one headlight.
so you understand? one headlight, one surgeon.
of course i understand.
and you owe me one, because i'm giving those fingers a good...
three hours off.
Oh, wait, wait. oh, that's not what i meant.
I'm-I'm sorry. just stop.
this is my case. you want me to ditch my original plan, fine.
you want to backseat drive, also fine.
you're the attending. i'm the fellow. i'll respect that.
but you're not stealing my surgery.
you're welcome to assist, to observe, to yammer about the good old days, but this is not one of them. this is my patient, my procedure.
headlight. now.
Yes, doctor.
we-we shouldn't have tried the surgery today, okay? it was too much.
being in the o. r. thinking about mark- torres- no, look, i shouldn't have been operating either.
look at us. we're emotional. it was just-it was bad- my hand went numb in there.
it's almost 5: 00.
so i discharged our cleft baby. he'll be back in about six months.
Oh, and i...
I decided against reconstruction... for grandpa.
I know it's not what we talked about, but...
and don't take it the wrong way, all right?
because...
you've taught me a lot.
but i think, um...
I really know what i'm doing now.
so...
I'm good.
the plastics posse's... gonna live on...
because, uh...
because i can take it from here.
after i stop his medication, i'm gonna extubate him.
okay, we're all doctors here. you don't need to say this.
I'm not saying it because you need to know the procedure.
I say it because even if you think you're prepared for what's about to happen, you're not.
your brain can't fully absorb what we're about to do.
but by saying this...
I'm giving you a little time to catch up.
so... after i stop his medications...
I'm gonna extubate him.
as indicated in his living will, dr. sloan asked that, if life-sustaining procedures would only prolong the moment of death, that these procedures be discontinued.
somewhere to be, dr. yang?
no. it's...
it's 5: 00 in seattle.
and 4: 00 a. m. in moscow...
and 8: 00 a. m. in singapore.
clamp.
Dr. sloan asked that if he were unable to make his own medical decisions, that his directive be honored by his chosen proxy.
his final request was that only comfort care be given to him in his final moments.
once support is removed, he may only hold on for a few minutes...
or the process could take hours.
I'm turning the ventilator off.
we've sedated him with morphine so he's not feeling any of this.
Thanks.
I'll give you some privacy.
we tried so hard... out there in the woods.
we thought if we could just get him back here alive...
I- i can't stay here.
i'm-i'm-tell derek that i was here and i had to go.
I am, uh...
I'm going to the airport. i'm gonna go see cristina.
okay.
what's wrong? chief, sorry.
I was just going somewhere else, actually.
that surgery was designed for you to fail.
the intern appy- it sets you as the example.
okay? don't let it get to you.
why is she so mean?
she's just trying to teach you.
no, why is she so mean?
is it that plane crash? what?
I heard she was in a plane crash with some other doctors.
they were stranded in the woods for, like, a week.
people died or almost died or something.
Yeah, yeah, people died or almost died or...
something.
Dr. grey isn't mean. she is strong.
and she's not gonna go easy on you because she knows that that would be a disservice to you. you are a surgeon.
it is your job to fix things other people can't.
now if you can't handle that, leave now. if not...
don't stand around in hallways and cry.
cry somewhere else, where i won't see you.
Yeah, come on in.
Dr. cristina yang of seattle fame, formerly of california.
sit.
how'd it go with dr. thomas?
uh, well, i'm happy to, uh, take one for the team, uh, but i'd appreciate if you steered him in somebody else's direction.
I'm not sure that's gonna work.
see, i've asked him to help you out, navigating the waters and all.
I found the cafeteria.
Yeah, it's... more than that.
my work has been impeccable. my record here is perfect.
if all you look at is outcomes, maybe.
but on our yardstick, you don't seem to be thriving.
I want you to succeed.
but the fact is, we work as a team here.
no one here is a superstar. our hospital is the superstar.
and our patients... they're superstars.
we pride ourselves on that.
no ego, no proprietary attitudes, no competition.
are you serious? we're sensitive to all you've been through.
if you want to talk to someone, i'm happy to give you names.
Dr. parker, that won't
look, why don't you take a few days...
see the lakes, check out the mall of america?
you know, everybody says they ride the roller coaster for their kids, but the adults eat it up.
go get some r&r. have a good time.
soften up those sharp seattle edges.
doctor's orders.
I'm sorry. is this r&r a suggestion or
it's mandatory, yang, starting now.
anything? no, not yet.
here you go, doctor. thank you.
d- does my nickname command respect?
no.
strike fear in the hearts of residents? no.
well, what is it?
you've been... happy.
and the interns noticed that your happiness often coincides with the arrival of- of dr. warren. and that's all i'm saying.
Oh, oh, come on now. you have to tell me.
no, i can't. i am a gentleman. and also, i don't wanna.
wh-wh-uh... oh, come...
okay, i'm gonna tell you this because i'm literally about to walk out of this hospital forever.
Mnh-mnh. karev. karev. your nickname's b. c.b.
B. c.b? booty call bailey.
that's what they call you.
thank you.
good-bye, dr. bailey.
Yeah. bye, karev.
Hey. so that's it? i'm not even as good as one of your intern girls, huh?
you're not gonna say good-bye to me?
Mer, what-what are you doing here? don't change the subject.
don't make this a thing. don't make this a thing?
mark is dying right now. and that's it? you're just gonna leave, too?
I'm just-i'm gonna be on the other side of the country.
it's, uh, we'll talk. it's not like
that's what cristina said. it's not the same.
nothing is the same. everything is different.
everyone's leaving and everyone is dying. don't make this my problem.
I'm finally getting the hell outta here.
I can't keep standing around being the guy who should've been on the plane that crashed.
I shouldn't be here, mer.
I... i should've left this freakin' place three months ago.
Alex! get off.
look, i'm not gonna stay in seattle just because you don't want to be alone.
look, hopkins won't wait forever.
I got a plane to catch, so bye.
watch it.
this is your final boarding call for all passengers for flight 3-9-8-4.
hold on, please.
you just made it. yeah.
thank you.
on behalf of the captain and our entire crew, welcome board flight 5-3-1
with nonstop service from seattle... to rochester, minnesota.
at this time, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their upright and locked positions.
this aircraft is equipped with several...
I have to go. in the event of an emergency landing...
I have to get up. i have to go.
find the nearest exit... i have to go.
in the event of an emergency... i'm sorry, miss. if you could please stay in your seat
no, i need to leave. you need to return to your seat. no, no, i don't think you're hearing me.
I need to get off the plane. i'm sorry. we're about to close the doors
open the door, or i'll pull the emergency exit myself. we can't-miss, i need you
get the hell out of my way. open that damn door... miss - and let me the hell off this plane!
I need you to calm- let me off the plane!
they say death is hardest on the living.
I had the boarding pass in my hand. i was...
standing there watching them board the plane, but i... couldn't move.
next time. we have to get past this.
I know. what are you doing here?
Hey, who is that? point me.
I'm sorry about before. you should be.
I'm sorry, too.
I thought you said he was leaving. i thought you said you were leaving.
the guy replacing robbins is just gonna mess the place up.
besides, i don't even like baltimore. so what are you saying?
I couldn't get on my plane, okay? i couldn't go.
you're saying you ditched the flight 'cause you chickened out.
what a loser.
when hunt lands, tell him i'm staying.
what? i just saw him here at the airport.
isn't he coming to see you?
it's tough to actually say good-bye.
sometimes it's impossible. come on, jax. slop time.
just about to get you over there.
you're just gonna get
Dr. hunt? hey. uh, your dad told me where i could find you.
what are-what are you doing here?
mark sloan died yesterday.
Oh, god. um... i'm so sorry.
I want you to come back and work at the hospital.
what?
nothing is the same over there.
it's all...
I keep trying...
I keep trying to think of ways i could've done things differently, and, uh... if i'd realized they were missing sooner, if i'd told cristina how much i...
I keep looking for the do-overs, and there's no do-overs.
there's just the way it is, and i can't fix that, except for this, for you. wh- i didn't teach you, not the way that i should have.
I- i should've helped you be strong instead of kicking you when you were down.
I should never have taken your job from you.
you don't belong out here on a...
a farm.
you belong in seattle, saving lives.
now come home.
uh, i can't keep doing this alone, arizona.
I just can't.
get up.
get the hell out of bed and snap out of this...
if not for me, then for sofia, because she lost a parent last night.
and i lost my best friend. and i will be damned if i lose you, too.
snap out of this? snap out of this?
how the hell am i supposed to snap out of this when you cut off my leg?
you never really stop feeling the loss.
everybody... cheese!
cheese.
nothing's happening.
Oh, come on. i think it's on video. should i go over there?
no, just give her a second. well, no, it's-i'm- i'm pressing the button.
it's just- it's not doing anything.
Oh... well... maybe it's broke and
I'm taking over. oh- no, no, no. oh, no.
I don't need your help. i don't need- we have a kid together, robbins.
so you're stuck with me and my help. it's what makes things so bittersweet.
we leave little bits of ourselves behind...
little reminders... a lifetime of memories, photos, trinkets...
Ohh. i got it.
things to remember us by even when we're gone.
the lab coats and badges and scrubs...
all work together to indicate a person of authority...
someone you can trust.
when the clothes come off, that's a different story.
we're sensitive, vulnerable... Human...
and just as prone to questionable judgment as anybody else.
Yes.
his hemoglobin is what?
okay, so just-just do an m. r.i. And a hemoccult, and I'll be right in.
my idiot intern thinks she found a rare retroperitoneal tumor.
so now I have to go in and tell her that she's wrong.
well, I'm sure she'll still be a wrong in 20 minutes.
I can take care of Zola this morning.
I, um, I don't have to lecture until 10: 00.
still not sure it justifies the size of my paycheck.
you're a great teacher.
I should know.
I was hot for teacher in my day.
Oh, really?
so what is on the ol' agenda today?
Oh, just catching up on, uh, thomas' plan for tomorrow's open p. d.a. Ligation and left main bypass.
I've never seen one before.
Yeah, that's because nobody's done it that way since 1993.
how long do you suppose that's gonna take?
17 hours give or take.
that's perfect.
what does that mean?
nothing.
I have 20 minutes.
want to go again?
I guess so.
that was the last time.
we can't do this anymore.
no, no, we won't, because this is the last time, ever.
okay. I'm gonna get some coffee. - I'm gonna go pray.
cool.
Oh, morning, Hunt.
it's beautiful out there.
Webber, what's with the tie?
Oh, just thought I'd up my game a bit today.
Yeah. - Where's yours? Huh?
I had kind of a rough night.
got a spare.
Oh, thanks.
don't mention it. - Yeah.
good morning, Bailey.
what's with the tie?
it felt like a tie kind of day.
Oh, well, does it also feel like a small bowel obstruction kind of day?
I'd be happy to have you scrub in.
Oh, not this afternoon. I'm busy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
you have an appointment with your haberdasher?
now what is so wrong with a man taking a little pride in his appearance?
Hello, handsome.
Oh, catherine, there you are.
Yes, here I am.
nice tie.
Yeah, whatever's wrong, that'll fix it.
Barnett decided everyone should create new passwords.
you do it in the settings menu.
but I - I can't access the settings menu without a new password.
so you're tryingeabr to k in?
Hey, probably gonna need to go back in and do a redo on Brody wright's humerus fracture, okay?
when the hell is robbins coming back?
uh... Wait, did you see her?
uh, did she see you?
Robbins is here?
Oh, damn it.
what?
uh... Um, she's... She's being fitted for her first prosthetic today, which I wasn't supposed to tell you, because the only way I was able to get her to agree to come in at all was to promise that no one knows she's here.
which makes two promises I've broken, if you count the time I said, "i promise you won't lose your leg," which she certainly does.
I didn't see her. - Good.
don't.
tell her I hope it goes well.
no, I can't, because then she'd know I told you she's here.
Yeah, right.
do you need me to write this down?
Hey, Dr. Robbins.
good morning. David moore.
I'm your prosthetist.
um, you know, we're-we're gonna be working together for a while.
uh, you can all me david.
um... Can I call you arizona?
what's a while?
well, till one of us dies or your leg grows back.
Yeah, that joke's always a risk.
which one of these is mine?
uh, none of those, actually.
today we're just gonna get you started on a post-op socket, and that'll give us a good idea of what's most comfortable moving forward.
may i?
Oh, excellent.
you see how there's no scar tissue?
that-that means its healing well.
Oh, great.
Yeah, it is.
all right.
uh, let's get to work?
Ah... Just stop having sex with him.
I am trying to fit in.
I live here now.
I have to just, you know, adapt.
so I'm making friends.
but you don't even like him.
who says I have to like him?
he's my sex friend.
well, what about the ancient guy?
what about him?
you want me to be sex friends with the ancient guy?
no. I want you to be regular friends with the ancient guy and stop having sex friends in general.
I am regular friends with the ancient guy.
he, frankly, is my bestie.
he's you here in Minnesota.
well, how does the ancient minnesota me feel about you being sex friends with parker?
you know, it's no big deal.
Parker is fine.
a little reptilian, a little chatty, but fine.
this is a cry for help.
it's a cry for an orgasm.
and how's that working out?
Dr. Grey, the radiologist report does indicate a retrocrural mass, which means I could be right, right?
or not?
holy crap. - What?
I gotta go.
holy crap.
is it a big surprise?
it's very big.
will I need to use two hands?
two hands won't be enough.
Dr. Webber, does this bed go down at all?
Bryan, um, this is the urologist that I was talking to you about.
this is Dr. Catherine avery.
um, before you say anything, uh, no, these aren't basketballs in my pockets, and, yes, I am very happy to see you.
surprise.
I don't understand why you've let it get this bad before seeking treatment.
he's using it as an excuse to avoid our 10-year high school reunion.
Paula, I am not.
he is.
it wasn't this bad before.
I mean, I-I've seen other doctors who prescribed pills that never seemed to work.
then a few months ago, everything sort of just... Blew up.
he wouldn't even have come if I hadn't dragged him.
I would have. - When?
after the reunion.
Bryan, there's no need to fear.
by the time we get finished with you, you'll be hitting that reunion with 98% less scrotum.
Dr. Thomas, the p. d.a. was one thing, but now with the blockage, does that mean two surgeries?
no, it means two procedures, both of which I propose to perform during one surgery.
we'll fix your p. d.a. From the side, then flip you over and then open up your blocked arteries from the front.
flip me, spin me... Whatever you want.
if it means not feeling like I'm trapped in the body of an 80 year old anymore, i'm in.
Janet, believe me.
I know exactly how you feel.
because he's old.
he's very, very old.
don't mistake Dr. Yang's disrespect for a sense of humor.
she hasn't got one.
Oh, no, no, no.
I - I respect you.
you're a historical landmark.
case in point.
like the grand canyon.
keep it up.- Only-only older.
Oh, all right. Enough. - Just a smidge.
Oh, my god.
a smidge older than that.
I work out all the time.
I read "men's health."
and I don't eat anything I actually want.
and you're telling me I'm gonna die?
this tumor is difficult to resect.
it's not impossible.
rob, you're in private security, right?
Yeah, I'm a bodyguard.
all right.
well, that's my job, too.
I have your back.
Yeah, you know what?
this tumor is just a little punk.
can I have some tissue, please?
any questions?
when you performed that transcranial resection of clival chordoma in 2003, did you realize you'd become a major influence on surgeons around the world?
any questions about central lines?
okay, look, I get that you went over this in med school, but as interns, you're gonna be asked to insert central lines every day.
do it incorrectly, and the patient could die.
I could be watching a whipple right now.
I heard that Dr. Webber's has a patient with scrotal lymphedema.
scrotal lyphedema? - Stop.
ladies.
uh, Dr. Shepherd.
I have a question about central lines.
great. Go ahead.
in learning to insert your first central line, did you develop any of the skills that contributed to your influential clival chordoma resection in 2003?
Dr. Yang, can I see you for a second, please?
you know, i'll be right back.
is this gonna take long?
just a quick question.
did you even try to suggest a less invasive approach?
uh, yeah. Of course I did. A hybrid surgery.
only one incision, done in half the time.
when?
when did you suggest it?
I don't know. Yesterday.
what did he say?
uh, ah, he said, "Are we a hospital or a pizza delivery service?"
he asked if we needed it done in 30 minutes or less.
he is so stubborn.
Yeah. Uh, but he's not wrong.
I mean, his way minimizes the risk of recurrent shunt.
I mean, it's old-school, but I never would've thought- Got it.
sounds great.
okay. So I can go back?
Yeah, go, go.
enjoy it while you can.
what does that mean?
will I be off probation soon?
just go.
most men would just bring a girl flowers.
you know, this is a very dangerous game we're playing.
I've done my best to keep jackson in the dark about the further adventures of catherine and richard.
which is why I made sure to grab Dr. Quaid for the skin flap.
there's no reason jackson needs to be in that o. r.
maybe that's a mistake.
I come into town to work on a case that has a large plastics component and don't bring him in?
you saying, it seems suspicious?
maybe. Oh, maybe not.
it's just like high school.
I know. Isn't it fun?
Ooh, when you said you were busy, you weren't kidding.
Dr. Bailey, how nice to see you.
uh, what happened to your small bowel obstruction?
cleared up.
Hey, you wouldn't need an extra set of hands on those puppies, would you?
um, w-well, actually, I was, uh, hoping, uh, that april kepner could come aboard.
Yeah, I'm, you know, I'm - I'm taking her under my wing.
she's fragile.
y - you understand.
that is a giant scrotum.
I do not understand.
I'm sorry, bailey.
um, n-next time.
you're the prosthe? tist? - yeah.
I've always thought that'd make a good title for a movie.
Hey, david moore.
Alex karev, peds.
um, if you're looking for Dr. Robbins, she's over in the clinic.
we're about to do a plaster cast of her residual limb.
but you've got a few minutes.
Oh, no, that's cool.
I was, uh, I was just hoping that you could tell me how she's doing.
any scar tissue or contractures?
no. So far, so good.
all right.
how soon before she's back up on her feet?
that's a little harder to say.
I should have a better idea after tomorrow, though.
tell her you stopped by?
no, no, don't, because, uh, I didn't.
all right.
keep trying, folks.
nobody gets it the first time.
or the 40th time, apparently.
I just can't seem to locate the vein.
okay, give it to me.
I, uh... Um... Close your eyes.
visualize the anatomy.
Sublcavian vein is what you're looking for.
okay, walk it up the clavicle.
okay. Watch on the angle. Not too deep.
I see it.
watch your angle.
boom.
that's arterial blood.
he's gonna bleed to death.
so not boom?
no. Not boom.
you've gotta work around the azygos and the hemiazygos veins.
there's fatty tissue, lymph nodes, lymphatic tissue, and the sympathetic chains, not to mention the fact that the tumor has lifted up the inferior vena cava and is adherent to the aorta.
this is a mess.
I know.
so how do we get the entire mass without having to resect the aorta?
I have no idea.
Yeah, I'm happy to take this off your hands.
I called you for an opinion, not to steal my surgery.
n - no first-year attending in her right mind is gonna want to take on something like this.
I mean, not when full responsibility for every decision made in the o. r.
falls on her shoulders. - Mine.
don't come crying to me when a man's bleeding out on your table just 'cause you think you bad.
Oh, she's bad.
Yeah, we'll see.
I still don't understand what it is I'm looking at.
those are testicles, Dr. Kepner.
don't worry, sweetheart.
they're not supposed to look like that.
I know what testicles are.
jackson didn't mention that you were coming.
he didn't know.
he made it very clear, he would like me to stay out of his personal business, so I am doing my best.
well, I think that's great.
I've made no such promises to you.
you need to start prepping for next year's boards.
there's a fellow in our gynecology department that's an excellent tutor.
and he's cute.
that's-that's not really even nec- I said it before, and I will say it again.
you're just too uptight, baby.
you need to get l-a-i-d.
Dr. Avery.
look at me.
I am having the best sex I have had in years.
and it's just opened me up like a flower, blossoming towards the sun.
that's a powerful image.
I bet that fellow knows his way around a woman.
Oh, relax.
I'm kidding.
see that?
that's what I mean.
uptight.
but I will give you his number, just in case.
Hey, Dr. Webber.
Dr. Webber. - Um, yes, sir.
why is my name on tomorrow's o. r. Schedule for a scrotal lymphedema surgery with you?
uh, got the wrong avery.
I'm doing the surgery with your-your mother.
my mother's here performing a surgery with you?
b - but we were hoping that you'd be available to do a skin flap.
actually, she sent me to find you for a consult.
o - okay, sure.
Yeah, I'll just be a minute. - Great.
just a few more minutes, okay?
it's fine.
sorry. I thought you'd be ready.
that's because you didn't check your voice mail.
you just looked to see who called.
if you had checked your freakin' voice mail, then you would know that I was still gonna be here a while, because you would've gotten the freakin' message!
I'll come back.
you know, my-my brother, he never checks his voice mail either.
it's maddening.
Derek must be so proud.
you'll be, like, Mr. And Mrs. Impossible tumor.
but that's the problem.
I mean, he's not Mr. Impossible tumor anymore.
and I don't want to rub his nose in it.
he's trying to be so cheery about teaching.
that's so sad. - It's not sad.
it's just an adjustment.
can you imagine never doing surgery again?
I can. I do. I mean, he didn't see this coming.
so I just try to enjoy it while I can.
Oh, my god. He doesn't see it coming.
Oh, my god.
Thanks, mer. I gotta go.
okay.
Oh, I hate teaching.
you love teaching.
I just never realized how much I rely on just having them be able to watch me do the thing.
well, I used to love it when you stood behind me and whispered instructions in my ear.
well, I can't do that with all the kids.
how are you?
Yes, I know.
so I'm guessing your intern didn't like finding out she was wrong about the tumor.
no, she didn't like it at all.
this is the last time.
the last time was the last time.
Yeah, but this is the last last time.
I have to be in the o. r. All day tomorrow with your mom.
you're in that surgery, too?
what do you mean, too?
wait. You're gonna be there?
Yeah.
no, no, no.
we cannot both be in that o. r.She's gonna figure it out.
she is obsessed with my sex life.
she's having amazing sex, so I have to, too.
Ga-wh- Sorry.
sorry.
you don't want to hear that.
Webber's still banging my mom.
that's who she called the best sex of her life?
and we're done here.
white wine.
what kind?
the big kind?
Torres, it's late.
Yeah.
well, you know how they say one of the biggest things couples fight about is money?
turns out money fights ain't got nothing on an amputation fight.
I can imagine.
Yeah, but I can't get mad or yell, because then I'm the woman yelling at her one-legged wife.
so I've been sleeping at mark's, but...
I don't think I can take another night in my dead best friend's bed.
it just reminds me that he's gone, and I end up having the worst dreams.
it's getting so bad, I even considered asking shepherd if I could crash in his trailer in the woods.
that's pretty bad.
Yep.
sorry. That was a lot.
Oh, I asked.
I'm not sure you did.
it's fine.
honestly... I haven't been sleeping too well, either.
want another? - Uh, yeah.
yeah? - Yeah.
he'll have another.
not to add insult to injury, but that's the worst tie I've ever seen.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, coming.
well, hey there.
uh, I didn't know we, uh - We're not.
what's your deal with Dr. Thomas?
you came here to talk about craig thomas?
well, color me disappointed.
you said,"enjoy him while you can." - What does that mean?
um... Come on in.
it's cold.
are you firing him?
we can't fire him.
we can... Force him to retire, though.
listen, telling you this breaks a whole bushel of board regulations.
tell me one mistake he's made.
he hasn't.
not yet.
but when he does, his age will make it an instant malpractice suit that we will lose.
he's years behind the medical education curve.
you said it yourself.
he refused to try a minimally invasive technique.
why, Because he's stubborn or because he doesn't know how?
that's why you've had me working with him.
well, yeah, you represent everything that is new and smart and advanced in our field.
you're his opposite.
and when the time comes to make a case, it won't hurt to have you help us do it.
you should've told me.
ethically, no.
ethically, yes.
you should have.
honestly, I never would've thought you'd have a problem with it.
I can't see anything.
you described them as,"so big, a sheet couldn't cover them.
I may have exaggerated.
okay, ladies, this isn't a sideshow.
gentlemen, step right up.
that's it?
okay. - That's not okay.
Oh, great. Karev's here.
here to make us all laugh with funny jokes about my hands on a man's parts.
this isn't funny. That poor guy.
I know.
can you imagine becoming so swollen that a surgeon needs to use a scalpel to dig out all that excess tissue until the testicles and cords hit the open air?
I mean, who even knows what happened to his penis in all that mess?
that's not okay.
nice.
your mother won't stop asking me why I look so tired.
why do you look so tired?
they look so cute together.
shut up.
think they look tired?
go to hell.
the hybrid surgery was a good pitch.
Yes, it was.
so why aren't we doing it?
because we have a surgical plan.
do you have a problem, Dr. Yang?
Nope. But I think you do.
I think you reject my pitches because they scare you.
I thought you were learning something from me.
I have.
I have learned that mortality is breathing down your neck, and you are running from the future like a scared old chicken.
I won't change my plan just because - Won't or can't?
I'm perfectly capable of threading a catheter, Dr. Yang.
prove it.
prove me wrong.
take a deep breath for me, Bryan.
good.
and let it out.
um... Wh-what about my recovery time?
I mean, is there any chance I won't be able to walk for a while?
God, Bryan.
stop hiding from Amy miller.
I'm not.
she probably won't even be at the reunion.
she will.
sheryl thompson told me so.
also said she's single.
you're not that skinny kid from rocketry club anymore.
you're smart.
you're funny.
you're good enough for Amy.
actually, you're too good for amy.
you would be the perfect guy except - Except I've got giant balls?
No!
except that you don't.
it's a good trade, grey.
my two leisurely abdominal surgeries for just one retrocrural tumor.
this is getting a little sad.
no, I'll tell you what's sad.
Meredith grey flaming out 'cause she doesn't know a good bargain when she sees one.
stop, Mr. Mays.
Mr. Mays! Mr. Mays, stop!
should've made the trade.
uh, Dr. Bailey.
Hey, um, I might be interested in a trade.
he's right over there.
I mean, do I call for backup? Do I get a net or what?
forget it.
I would operate out here, but I don't think it's particularly sterile.
you lied to me.
I didn't.
that intern was in the hallway bragging to all her little friends about my once-in-a-career tumor.
she said you didn't even know where you were gonna start.
with a tumor like this, no surgeon would until you're open and on the table and I can get a look at the thing.
Yeah, well, that's terrifying.
I know.
that's why I didn't tell you.
you're an emotional guy.
not usually.
I mean, at work, i'm in dangerous situations all the time.
but then, you know, it's all about the client.
so I'm not allowed to freak out.
but right now, i'm freaking out.
okay. Well, today you're allowed, because I won't.
th-that intern's got a big mouth.
Yeah. Tell me about it.
Dr. Torres.
um, did you hear anything about robbins' fitting?
I mean, uh, moore said - You spoke to moore?
I told you not to do that.
if she'd seen you - Look, I'm the one who cut off her leg.
if she has a problem adjusting to the prosthetic or if turns out she's gotta have more surgery...
I mean, what if I screwed it up?
she even blames me for being on the plane.
she doesn't blame you, Karev.
she doesn't even know you made the cut.
I made the call, okay?
I was supposed to protect her.
I'm the bad doctor, the bad person.
your name never comes up.
now if this doesn't feel right, I can adjust it or-or we can try a whole new cast.
it's fine.
don't rush this.
if it's not right, you're the one that suffers, not me.
okay, let's get you up on your feet.
no, that's fine.
I don't need to - I need to see you take a few steps.
let's see how it feels when you put some weight on it, all right?
no. Hey, let go!
Arizona, you-you can't do this on your own.
you need help.
if we do this right and we - And we get you on a prosthetic that fits, you'll need less, but you are not there yet.
and, you know, you're very lucky to have people in your corner that care.
you should let them help.
you're like a gift from god.
I - I was talking about me.
I barely know you.
I'm here because this - This is my job.
I have plenty of other things I could be doing right now.
yeah? Well, why don't you go do them?
you know, I think I will.
okay, folks.
let's get started.
Dr. Shepherd. - Yeah.
we were wondering if, instead of a lecture, we might be able to watch Dr. Grey remove that rare tumor.
Dr. Grey is not removing a rare tumor.
Yeah, she is.
no, she's not.
but she and Dr. Brooks are in o. r. One right now.
what did you say to him?
who?
because, you know, legally, I could get in a lot of trouble for telling you about the
I didn't say anything.
it was his idea.
Really?
he just suddenly changes his mind and goes with an approach he rejected two days ago?
I know. I was surprised, too.
I was, like,"whoa, what a surprise."
okay.
no, actually, maybe we lucked out.
I've never seen him use one of those.
I wouldn't even allow it if I didn't know you'd be in there to take over when he craps out.
when he does, it might just be all the board needs to proceed with his dismissal.
Dr. Yang.
suction.
I'm sorry.
you're just such a badass.
and I shouldn't have been bragging, but I-I liked feeling like one, too.
if I was a real badass, I would've just kept my mouth shut, been stoic, silent.
Yeah. Why don't you try that?
more suction, please.
I can't get good visualization.
that's a big tumor.
Yeah, it is.
she didn't even tell me about it.
I found out through one of my interns.
my wife is bubble wrapping me.
shepherd, you have a reputation for needing to be bubble wrapped.
excuse me?
you fight for your patients against the worst possible odds, but when things get messy personally, you're gone...Off to the woods to drink and grow a beard.
and with everything that's happened and this lawsuit keeping it all alive, maybe she just...
worried that the slightest little thing is gonna make you run off to that trailer and leave her alone in the house you gave her, not sleeping at night because whichever room she lays down in, she just can't get away from the fact that you're just not there.
sounds like you had that all teed up and ready to go.
Yeah. Yeah, well, a version of it.
it's meant for somebody else, you know, but, uh, it kind of works here, too.
you don't think she's coming back.
no. No, I don't.
here it is.
where do we start?
we need to identify the testicles and the cords.
don't want to damage them.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll keep my eyes peeled.
I'm having the best time.
forceps.
what's with the face?
I'm not making a face.
I've spent a few thousand hours looking at you with a mask on.
I know when you're making a face.
Bailey, I'm not making a face.
just so you know, I did not bully april kepner into giving up this surgery.
she approached me.
so... Nuts to her.
get it?
nuts to her?
Oh, come on.
you get it.
I'm an urologist, Dr. Bailey.
of course I get it.
Hey, I spend most of my day in a bowel.
doesn't mean I don't laugh at a fart.
Oh, tough room.
Oh, hey, Avery, knock, knock.
I think I just located the left testicle.
Yes, you have.
I will continue to excise the surrounding tissue.
if someone can just get a hand underneath... - Yeah.
uh, sorry. - No, no, no. Please. Go ahead.
no, I insist.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
it's just a little testicle.
somebody get up in there.
of all the organs in the body, of course it had to be this one.
damn. Damn it.
you know, I'm pretty sure no one's ever closed a p. d.a. By swearing at the catheter.
I don't need any tips, thank you.
I've used a guide wire before.
Really?
was that before or after you learned to use sheep's blood to lift a witch's curse?
would you be quiet?
damn.
just relax.
I can't pass the wire.
you-you better take over.
here.
your-your right wrist.
just turn it in, like this.
I don't have time for this.
just-just try it. Try it.
all right. All right. All right.
that's all, huh?
that's pretty neat.
if you'd like, I can advance the balloon for you - Back off, sister.
eyes on your own work.
you okay?
what are you doing here?
I was looking for Moore.
it looks great.
incision's healed well.
no edema.
you haven't completely destroyed my department, have you?
me?
I'm the one thing that's kept that place together.
this guy Barnett's a one-man wrecking crew.
we need you back.
I'm trying.
you... You know, callie's trying, too.
boy, that went like gangbusters in there.
it did, huh?
you could look a little less disappointed.
the guy's a historical treasure.
that's funny.
no, it's not.
you're right.
but on the bright side, you're out of surgery sooner than expected.
what do you say to a little, uh - I'm meeting a friend for drinks.
nice. That's nice.
you're making friends.
well - Good night.
it's a little loose.
and it - And it pinches right here.
and it hurts a little there.
okay.
well, let me see what we can do about that.
Dr. Shepherd.
I was visualizing the anatomy all wrong.
but if I just do it the way you told me...
excellent work.
keep going.
it's, uh, not so hopeless after all.
Hey, you - You got a second?
Yeah.
good news, Bryan.
the procedure went as planned.
Amy miller's got a lot to look forward to.
you know, it's really not about Amy.
but Paula and I have been friends for so long, I've never really known how to say it.
son, uh, it's none of my business, but I don't think you oughta be ashamed of your feelings.
seems to me we just surgically removed the only thing you had to be embarrassed about.
there's a whole lot less of you under that blanket.
would you mind?
no, not at all.
think we'll get invited to the wedding?
I need a moment to talk to Dr. Webber, man to man.
Oh, no. No, you don't.
mom. - It's all right.
well, all right, then.
all right, here's the deal
I understand how two people can be drawn together even though they know it's incredibly wrong and it's something that shouldn't have happened.
sex is a powerful force.
all right, look... You hurt my mom, and I hurt you.
I wouldn't hurt your mom.
I like her. - And I don't like that you like her.
well, man to man, you're just gonna have to deal with it.
you don't want a piece of this.
not today.
I'm watching you.
I hope you like the view.
I know what you're thinking.
I'm married.
I haven't forgotten that.
actually, I was thinking that all of that over there took some pretty big balls.
how was your day?
fine.
how about the tumor? Hmm?
I was in the gallery.
that was no big deal.
I'm not gonna grow a beard and run off and live in the woods anymore.
if you have a good day, I want to hear about it.
it was amazing, actually.
I didn't know where the hell to start.
I stood there staring at the thing forever.
I knew that supraceliac aorta was gonna be a bitch to get around.
and I couldn't risk clamping without killing off the gut and the kidneys.
and then finally, it just came to me.
Mattox maneuver.
that's a trauma move.
right, and it exposed thsiother e de of the kidney, and wham - I had perfect visualization.
what is that for?
contact high.
I might not come down for hours.
okay, uh, Sofia's down for the night.
and, uh, I'll be at mark's if you need anything.
"American Bake-off" is on in a few minutes.
it might be hard for a surgeon to admit...
but there's no shame in simply being human.
it can be a relief to stop hiding...
to accept who you really are and let the world see you that way, too.
mom.
you okay?
I'm fine.
are you sure? - Yeah.
want to have sex?
Yeah.
a little self-awareness never hurt anybody.
I know they're trying to push me out.
got this watch at a surprise retirement party four years ago.
I mean, it's a piece of junk but I wear it just to screw with them.
they are so polite.
they don't dare say anything directly, you know?
it's been a while since I've had anyone who cared enough to give me grief.
um, I'll have another tequila, and, uh, something that contains actual alcohol for my friend here.
Oh, no, it's late.
it's, like, 10: 15.
have a drink.
okay. Yeah.
I'll have, um... An old fashioned.
what?
Really? An old - You know what? I'll have two. Two.
make it two old fashioneds.
there you go.
old fashion.
because when you know who you are...
it's easier to know what you're about...
and ultimately...
what you really need.
Cristina, please. Say something, please.
I'm worried that you're just running away.
Oh, yeah, I am. I'm fleeing.
and so should you,'cause horrible things happen here.
no. Something horrible happened, and we should stick together.
how is yang, by the way?
does she like Minnesota?
who says I have to like him?
he's my sex friend.
how'd it go with Dr. Thomas?
I respect you. You're a historical landmark.
it's been a while since I've had anyone who cared enough to give me grief.
he is my bestie.
he's my you here in Minnesota.
they call you Medusa- The serpent-haired monster who turns folks to stone.
I don't think that you're a demon.
focus on what you're doing.
are you firing him?
we can't fire him.
we can force him to retire, though.
it's okay if you're not ready to fly.
I said I'd come. I'll be there.
she's not gonna get on that plane, is she?
probably not.
you are my person.
you will always be my person.
sometimes things are simply out of your control.
you can't change them.
you can't bend them to your will.
it doesn't matter if you're already 45 minutes late, if your hair isn't brushed, and you haven't fixed breakfast, and you're hemorrhaging brain cells by the second while you sit here...
dying... Dying inside.
pee. Pee.
just relax and pee.
did you do it?
did you a pee-pee in the big-girl potty?
potty.
pee-pee in the potty. pee-pee in the potty.
please don't make me strangle you.
I can't move.
I need to move, but I can't.
I think I may be frozen to this spot.
literally frozen.
I could stay.
keep you warm.
do you like being the big spoon or the little spoon?
I am not a spoon.
I'm a knife, and I'm gonna stab you in the eyeball.
you know, I think I'm gonna try and get some sleep.
you sure?
I can't look at you.
I'm sure.
I can't look at you either.
okay, please tell me you're as miserable as I am?
we are potty training, and I am wearing an apron.
no, I'm happy as can be.
my coat doubles as a sleeping bag.
here you go, zo.
Hi, zozo.
now don't forget to tell mommy if you have to go pee. Okay?
it's all about the layers, mer.
good morning. How are you?
morning!
we sure got a nice fresh snowfall last night.
sure did!
have a good one.
you too!
who is that?
just me being neighborly.
I'm neighborly now.
Oh, no. I think she just... Did you just pee on me?
I think she just peed on me.
see, you have a fake voice, too.
well, I'm using it on a child.
you're supposed to.
you know what? Tell her she's got to get her act together or she'll never be on the supreme court.
she's gotta buck up.
excuse me?
buck up.
all right. It's a Minnesota thing.
we don't wallow in our self-pity.
we're-we're tough.
we're friendly.
we're...
my car is buried under a mountain of snow.
buck up.
I hate you.
- So she needs a change...
and I am late.
okay.
well, daddy's gonna take a train today to give a boring paper to a bunch of boring people.
zola, your daddy's my hero.
I love you. - bye.
I'll see you in a couple days.
all right. - I forgot the fish sticks.
what for?
Oh, it's, uh, multicultural day at preschool.
we're brazil.
I burned the first batch.
all right. I'll see you later.
okay, bye.
say good-bye, mama.
Bye-bye, mama.
I know.
well, you're in a mood.
my car is buried under a mountain of snow.
don't get crumbs on the upholstery.
you brought me a danish.
don't-don't get emotional.
just eat it.
you're going to need your strength. Here.
a complete vascular ring.
and a huge aneurysm.
biggest aneurysm I have ever seen.
considering how old you are, that is saying something.
now if you're gonna start talking like that, I'm going to get someone else to scrub in with me.
this is ours?
still in a mood?
Oh, thank you, god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm - I'm trying to drive here.
that ginormous thing is in my body?
Yes.
it formed because of a congenital heart defect, so it's been there a long time.
we'll need to perform two surgeries.
the first one will repair the aneurysm.
in the second, we'll deal with the defect to prevent another aneurysm from forming.
and we thought we were ready for everything.
all right, this is nothing.
we're prepared for a nuclear holocaust.
this is just a few days in the hospital.
are we expecting a nuclear holocaust?
no, we're trained for disasters.
are you E. M. T. s?
no, we're - Will.
what?
these are my doctors, and I don't want them to think we're crazy.
Hey, we're not crazy.
we're doomsday preppers, ready for the apocalypse.
you think we're crazy.
no. - No, no.
look, we're not, like, Mayan calendar nut jobs.
we're preparing for the real stuff - Ozone depletion, global warming, melting ice caps.
we met at a workshop on making bug-out bags.
dare I ask?
they're survival backpacks.
you should really have one or several, actually.
uh, one in the home and one in the car.
so your surgery will be this afternoon.
we just need to run some scans, and then we'll be all set.
okay. That's okay, babe.
small doses of radiation prepare your body for ozone depletion.
I guess it's my lucky day.
it's huge.
I e-mailed it to you.
look at my giant aneurysm and marvel at the gift Thomas gave me.
I can't. I'm driving.
besides, I'm jealous. You have a new best friend.
I really do.
I might love him more than you.
I'm happy for the both of you.
and I get two surgeries out of it, 'cause she has a complete vascular ring.
imagine your good luck.
Oh, are you still being a bitter working mother?
I am. I have pee on my shoe.
you're a doctor. Can't you call it urine?
because "urine on my shoe" is more appealing?
I need help! - Oh, there's an accident.
is it bad?
it doesn't look like it.
I gotta go.
I'm fine.
there was a woman on a bicycle.
I think I hit her.
I heard my tire blow.
Hurry! Someone call 9-1-1.
I'll do it. I'll call.
she's being crushed under there.
does anybody know c. p. r?
can you hear me?
I'm a doctor.
what's your name? - Is she breathing?
I- I can't br-breathe.
okay, Melissa, we're gonna get you outta here.
okay?
I'm a doctor.
she can't breathe.
we gotta get this car off of her.
I'm on with 9-1-1 and they say don't move her.
the paramedics are on the way.
she can't breathe!
she will die before they get here.
look, I don't wanna be responsible if she's paralyzed.
don't you see she's dying under there?
do you wanna be responsible for that?!
I need someone to help me move this car.
is anybody gonna help me?!
is anybody gonna help me?!
come on, guys. We got this.
all right.
ready, guys.
okay, everyone on three.
we got this, okay?
here we go.
one, two, three.
come on! Just about.
just a little higher. - Okay, let me help you.
okay, easy, easy.
she's almost there! - Okay! She's out!
Oh, she's-she's blue.
come on, damn it.
breathe. Come on. Breathe. Breathe.
breathe, damn it.
Oh, she's alive.
she's alive. She's alive.
Oh, Dr. Yang. I hope you got some shut-eye.
a gastropericardial fistula came into the e. r. and I'd like you to join me.
uh, With a pneumopericardium?
a huge one.
did you do a pericardial decompression?
just about to.
I can't. I'm scrubbing in with Thomas.
Cristina... I'm offering you a gastropericardial fistula.
chocolate? Pretzels?
no. Chocolate.
Dr. Yang. - Sorry. Not available.
Wilson, I've got cyclist versus auto.
multiple crush injuries.
I need you to call upstairs.
tell them we need a trauma o. r. Open, and get Ross.
he's on my service.
you, I need you to go get my car.
it's at the intersection of 4th and pike in the backseat, there's a box of frozen fish sticks.
grab 'em, nuke 'em, bring 'em up to day care for brazil day.
Grey, you know you just stole my intern?
sorry.
it's interesting how crazy you can be and still comb your hair.
I find her delightful.
you got a bug-out bag in that big ol' car of yours?
I have no desire to survive armageddon.
when the big one hits, I want to go quickly.
it's an apple, the state fruit.
I don't recall mentioning this surgery to you at all.
Dr. Yang, could I talk to you?
that aneurysm is a disaster area.
we have a solid surgical plan.
let me assign the surgery to somebody else.
no.
look, I don't know what's going on.
maybe you pity Thomas.
maybe you actually like him.
hell, I like him.
he's a great old guy.
but there's nothing to gain by working with him.
nothing.
there is, actually.
suction.
there's a lot of blood.
suction keeps clogging up.
adjust the angle. Lower your hand.
Ross, let's run the small bowel.
how do I do that again?
just take them in your hands, look for injuries, nice and slow.
Hey, I just dropped Sofia off at day care.
did you remember it was multicultural day?
uh, yeah. I made fish sticks.
I signed up for plantains and I totally forgot.
I'm sure no one will notice.
Yeah, well, mark always kept track of that stuff.
okay, the break is near the femoral artery.
she's losing a lot of blood?
um, yeah.
suction. - I'm trying.
okay, Wilson, just get in there and just scoop it out with your hands.
just scoop it out.
just get right in there.
this would go faster if I used scissors.
well, when the tissue is this thin and friable, - I find the fingers are easier to isolate the anatomy. - Oh, there you go.
okay, I've located the insertion point in the carotid.
Ah, Dr. Parker.
two visits in one day.
what a treat.
well, it's my job to ensure my department is working to the highest standard.
Oh, nonsense.
you want a front-row seat to my inevitable demise.
I hope you'll forgive me if I disappoint.
Dr. Yang, are we ready for bypass to the subclavian?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
did the aneurysm blow?
hold pressure.
I'm trying to. I'm trying to.
the hole's getting bigger.
damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
watch your language, Dr. Yang.
I run a respectable o. r. Clamp.
Dr. Yang, I suggest you get one, too.
put her on bypass.
you need time to - Listen to me.
Dr. Yang will tell you that I have been doing this since the jurassic period.
we'll have this done in a jiffy.
that's it. I'm scrubbing in.
clamp on.
let's go, Dr. Yang.
time's a-wasting.
okay. The liver's exsanguinating.
Ross, suction.
Wilson, grab a clamp for this.
right away.
which one should I ask for?
Debakey.
good news.
we tracked down the young woman's parents in Toronto.
they're getting the first flight.
suction, and let's hang more blood.
that one makes 57.
Grey, we've replaced her entire volume of blood four times.
I got this.
more laps.
it might be time to pack her and let her rest.
looks like you're at a point of diminishing returns, Grey.
there's a limit to how much this patient can take.
she was crushed by 2 tons of twisted metal.
that's a lot of trauma for the body.
I know. I know exactly how much trauma that is for a body.
I'm not doing damage control here.
I'm not gonna pack her up and hope for the best.
I need you to stop.
she needs an intact liver.
Meredith, just take a second.
I am trying to save her life.
hands off the patient. Now.
let's pack her up.
that was a train wreck in there.
we saved her life.
that aneurysm could have blown no matter what we did.
you know that.
you should've listened to me when I suggested that you put her on
you walk into my o. r.In the middle of a surgery and try to backseat drive?
I'm trying to help you, Craig.
I'm not craig. I'm Dr. Thomas.
and I don't need or want your help.
Dr. Thomas, you're a danger to our patients.
I need to see a patient.
surrender your license.
go out gracefully.
it's time.
I will not step down.
okay. You want to go that way, we can go that way.
starting today, I sign off on every patient you see- Every scan, every band-aid.
talk to him.
please.
so her liver has been packed.
the next 24 hours are crucial.
monitor her closely.
um, Meredith, do you have a moment?
do you want me to take point on this?
on my patient? No.
Meredith, I'm concerned that... This may be hitting a little too close to home.
I mean, after what you've been through, what... What happened with your sister...
same injuries, same age.
what's your point?
emotions might be clouding your judgment.
they're not.
excuse me. I have to go check on my patient.
what happens now?
the next few hours are critical.
when she wakes up, if she can speak and move her arms and legs, then we'll know she got good blood flow and that the grafts held.
I'm sorry, uh... Flowers aren't allowed in the c. c.u.
we have a seed bank in case, you know, it-it all goes to hell.
we have every grain and every fruit and vegetable you need.
katy was like, "what about the flowers, Will?
if the world is ending, I'm gonna want something beautiful.
you know, I'll put them just outside.
she can see them from there. Okay?
this is my fault.
the aneurysm would've blown no matter whose hands were on it.
her vessels are cotton candy.
I know, but parker wouldn't have given that surgery a second thought if I wasn't in there with you.
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
that man has been after my hide for a long time.
probation is one step away from being fired.
you know, I find it a little unseemly to worry about my employment prospects when there's a woman's life hanging in the balance.
come on. I'm gonna give you a ride home.
we have another surgery tomorrow.
you need your sleep.
it's going to be fine.
thomas made me leave my patient.
now she's gonna die, and he'll be fired.
well, I'm leaving my patient, too.
I have to pick Zola up from day care, and Derek's out of town so it has to be fine.
it's not gonna be fine.
she's surrounded by interns.
that's one of the signs, Meredith, like locusts or the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
well, except there's only three of them and it's one night.
you need a bug-out bag.
what's that?
like a diaper bag for adults.
I'm making mine right now.
well, what do you have so far?
tequila.
well, that's a good start.
what else?
well, the sign of a well-packed diaper bag is backups in case you run out.
so more tequila?
I am out... Trying to have one night, and my intern decides to close my patient's wound
an infected wound, which I left open to heal.
dumbass, over-eager, barely-out-of-med-school child!
I'm staying.
I'm going back.
Hey, cutie pie.
okay. I gotta run.
my interns are with my patient.
there's extra clothes in the bag.
okay. Okay.
no, no, no. No. No, don't do that to yourself.
it's good for her to see you work.
it is good for her to see you achieve.
Yes. That's how she'll become c. e. o. One day.
Yeah?'cause mommy works. That's good.
okay. I owe you one.
my first surgery's at 10: 00. I'll just drop her off at day care with Sofia.
okay. Bye.
well, can't you just give your sex friend more sex in exchange for not firing your old man friend?
I'm not a prostitute.
besides, I thought of that.
it's just way too much sex.
she is barely hanging on.
should I take her back into surgery?
what does Webber think?
he thinks I'm too emotional to handle this.
vitals check. - Okay.
are you still there? - Yeah. Why are you whispering?
granola guy's asleep.
he brought his own hemp pillow.
stable over here.
you?
Stable-ish.
maybe we should try to get some sleep.
I'm not gonna be able to sleep.
Yeah. Me neither.
you know what we need? - What?
a 30-second dance party.- Okay.
I'm too tired. - Yeah, me, too.
you do it.
Dr. Yang.
please be alive.
good news. Ms. Doomsday is doing great.
while you were getting your beauty sleep, a lot has happened.
Katy, why don't you fill in Dr. Yang?
although she hasn't had her coffee yet, so maybe just give her the broad strokes, hmm?
you guys are gonna go ahead with my second surgery this afternoon.
Dr. Yang will start to prep you... As soon as she brushes her teeth.
she needs another surgery to take out the packing and check for more bleeding, but right now she would never survive it.
so what do we do?
there's a perfect window.
we have to correct her acidosis and her hypothermia and make sure her coags are stable.
and until then?
until then, we have to try and keep her alive.
I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I have surgery in ten minutes.
I tried leaving her in day care, but she's running a little fever.
no big deal. I'm sure she's just teething.
but they won't take her if she hasn't been fever-free for 24 hours.
did I mention I have surgery?
in ten minutes.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Grey, the patient's b. p. Just plummeted to 70 over 50.
crap.
no, I-no. I did your fish stick drop.
I valeted your car.
I am here to practice medicine.
great. Monitor her temp.
if it gets above 101, give her a teaspoon of acetaminophen and push fluids.
her sippy cup is in the bag.
Bye, zo.
Bye-bye.
this is a bad idea.
Parker will never sign off on this surgery.
I can't tell you how strenuously I object to your extracurricular gymnastics with that man.
he's making you conventional and skittish.
you know, condoms don't protect against that.
h- how did
you were the first one to point out, I've been around a long time.
now Katy is awake, she's speaking, she's moving her extremities.
Yes, but
the repair worked, so why put her in danger of another life-threatening aneurysm?
well, what about parker?
I spend very little time thinking about him.
can I assume that's your child I hear wailing outside those doors?
well, I- She has a fever, and Derek is out of town, and I have this patient
Dr. Grey, you know why men think they can run the world and women can't?
because of crying babies.
I was hoping no one would hear it.
uh, we can all hear it.
I can hear it.
uh, Dr. Ross out there can hear it.
only difference is, the crying doesn't affect him.
but you and I are genetically predisposed to respond to crying babies.
it's pulling your focus.
it's gonna be fine. I'm almost done.
okay, this is about world domination.
if we're going to take over, we need to have our babies crying somewhere other than the i. c.u.
Dr. Yang, could you go over the risks of the surgery one last time?
will, Dr. Thomas went over all of it already.
I could die or turn into a potato or start leaking unicorn poop out of my ears.
I signed the scary paper already. I'm doing it.
he also said that you could live with this condition for years without another aneurysm.
right?
Yes.
last night, I didn't know if you'd even wake up.
and now I know what the end of the world feels like, and I don't want to feel that again.
you want me to live with a sword hanging over my head every day, afraid to hiccup because I might blow an aneurysm?
that's not living, and you know it.
we take action, Will.
we look disaster in the eye and we do not shrink with fear.
tell him, Dr. Yang.
tell him it's gonna be all right.
scissors.
get the tube ready. - Got it.
I'm here. - Lung collapsed.
I have to do this chest tube.
I can keep her till 3: 00, but then I - I've got a hernia repair.
Hey, brooks, see if zola's temp is down and if you can sweet talk day care into taking her back.
okay. - Tube is in. Zero silk.
I'll just go get her.
okay, uh, don't forget her diaper bag.
she's got extra clothes in there, diapers.
the sippy cup is in the side pocket, and if she goes pee-pee in the potty
Meredith, I'm not gonna potty train your kid.
right. Okay.
sorry. Forget it. - Already did.
he's doing it, mer.
he's doing the surgery.
and if he does it, he'll get fired.
Yeah.
I need to figure out the exact right time to reopen my patient.
a month ago, this would've been someone else's decision.
I was just a resident along for the ride.
now if I misjudge... - Yeah.
doomsday. - Yeah.
you know what we need?
dance party?
Nope.
we need to buck up.
Yep.
Dr. Parker. - Ah, Dr. Yang.
you're a day late and a dollar short.
I just had to reopen my gastropericardial fistula - You need to take Dr. Thomas off probation.
I take it you weren't able to convince him to go gracefully?
why would I?
he's a liability.
Oh, because he's old?
no, because habitually undermines my authority.
look, you were in that o. r. Yesterday.
Yeah, he saved our patient's life.
he was insubordinate and reckless.
he cut out her aneurysm and interposed a graft in under 30 minutes.
now I can't do that. Can you?
there's no good reason - Cristina, there is no point in belaboring this.
it's done.
then undo it.
let him ride out his tenure.
firing him would be bad for the hospital and bad for you.
please, just-just- Just let this slide.
look, I know you're in an awkward position, and it's partly my fault for sticking you with him.
you came in a little strong, and I felt like I needed to temper your overconfidence.
but he's holding you back.
and once he's gone, you'll see that.
okay, her temp is 96.
what were her last coags?
her i. n.r. Was 1. 3,and I tested her ph levels 2 hours ago, and it was 7. 29.
okay, let's run 'em again.
why the hell are you sitting out in the cold?
sun's out.
gotta take advantage.
let me do the surgery with someone else.
Dr. Yang - Or go kiss his ass.
play politics.
I don't think you understand how serious he is.
there is a path that a doctor walks in this hospital.
they begin by thinking that I'm some sort of god.
then they start to worry that I'm insane.
and then they take some comfort in the notion that it's just senility.
I mean, we've gone from "a" to "z" in no time at all.
Yeah, well, if this goes south, it could be the end for you.
so be it. Maybe I'm ready.
well, I'm not.
you can't leave me alone here.
Oh, we're talking about you now, hmm?
you should've raised the flag.
I couldn't work here without you.
you're afraid to fly. You're not going anywhere.
Hey, it's not funny.
no, it isn't.
you love me more than anybody has in a very long time.
look, if I'm going, I want to go down fighting for something that I believe in, for this young woman's future, and-and these women who have so much to live for.
Oh, come on.
you know I'm right.
you know that she deserves this surgery.
and we're the best team to do it.
so... You decided to go back in.
this is my window.
her ph and coags are good.
she'll never make it through another day if I don't stop this bleeding.
what?
Oh, nothing. I just, um - Don't. Don't say it.
say what?
this is nothing like what happened in the woods.
we are in a hospital with medical resources that we could only dream of having out there.
and I'm gonna use them and try like hell avto se this girl's life so when her family comes I can tell them she's alive.
so don't say this is lexie. It's not lexie.
good luck.
that's all I was gonna say.
good luck.
thank you.
and it's the right call, bringing her back in.
I was gonna say that, too.
so we'll take the packs out slowly so that we can look for the bleed.
wait. It's 4: 30.
I thought you were with Zola.
uh, no, yeah, 4:00 to 5: 00, that's Dr. Kepner's shift.
Yeah, that was before my surgery went long.
23 year old with more gallstones than I've ever seen.
it's weird, right, 23 year old with gallstones?
april, who has my daughter?
uh, Jackson, I think.
when I realized my surgery was going long, I sent my intern to make sure that Alex could take her for longer, but he couldn't push his surgery again, so he left her with Ted, so I was just about to go relieve him right now.
unless Jackson go there first.
his shift was after mine so - Who's ted?
um, nurse ted from the e. r.
and I can tell by the look on your face that you don't know who ted is.
um, don't worry about it.
I - I'm going there right now.
Zola will be fine. Okay?
Ross follow her.
do not leave her side until my daughter is physically in her arms.
on it.
ready, Dr. Yang?
ready, sir.
scissors.
here you go.
wire cutters. - Wire cutters.
Balfour retractor - Here you go, doctor.
these vessels are so fragile.
let's go gently.
you're gonna have to suction like your life depends on it.
if your hands move even a centimeter without my say, she's gonna bleed out.
Where's my suction?
I'm trying, but there's a lot of bleeding over here.
okay, keep trying, Wilson.
Wilson, hold still.
I thought I was.
Ross, are you sure my kid's okay?
it's like camp Zola in the attendings lounge.
she was smashing gummy worms into her face when I left.
who's letting her have gummy worms?
you're right. It doesn't matter. Get in here and help retract.
I need more visibility.
if this continues to go this well, I'm prepared to put your name first.
when we publish?
that's big of you.
it is.
you know what? You need it more than I do.
this could be your last journal article.
is that your version of "thank you"?
no, it's my version of "this is the end. Get while the getting's good."
thank god I never had children. They'd be just like you.
I'd have drowned them like puppies ithe river.
Oh, come on.
I'm your dream come true.
that... Is the truth.
you're gonna make me gag.
B. p.'s dropping.
this is really a lot of blood.
who moved?
somebody moved.
say it now.
it did.
just a little. I'm sorry.
it-it's okay.
it actually helps.
it-it means the bleeder's in the retroperitoneum.
okay, now literally this time, nobody move.
don't be crass.
women of your generation think they have to be crass or no one will believe their strength.
you're fighting a battle that women of my generation have already fought for you so you could have the grace to appreciate their work and move on to something else.
Yeah, I'm still gagging.
these sutures aren't holding.
can I have another 4-0 prolene, please?
B. p. Is really down.
I'm well aware of that.
stop looking at the monitors and just help me find this bleed.
watch your dissection and don't hold your breath.
now you're gonna tell me when to breathe?
renal vessels are clear.
damn it. Keep retracting.
you hold your breath when you stitch.
when you stop breathing, you stop thinking.
it's a mistake.
now what?
hang on.
I'm breathing.
slowly.
not like an anxious hyena.
freeze. Keep your hands where they are.
we have to find the source or she's dead.
okay, do not panic.
don't panic.
my name will be first.
saw that coming a mile away.
you will be the surgeon of your generation.
I knew it as soon as I met you.
people will try to diminish you as they did me, and they will fail.
I would like it to be known in the medical community that I helped train you. hmm?
okay. Your name first.
found it. Clamp.
tiny tear in the external iliac.
okay, does anybody know what we do now?
ligate the artery.
Nope.
replace the clamp with a patch.
Nope.
then what?
30-second dance party.
dance or you're fired.
