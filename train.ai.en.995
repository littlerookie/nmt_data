I don't know yet.
FBI! Don't move!
I said turn the music down now!
up against the wall! Everybody up against the wall now!
up against the wall!
do you believe in god?
excuse me?
do you believe in god?
Yes.
how about the devil?
is someone going to tell me why I'm here or are we just going to play staring games all night?
this was found where Cherish Hanson went missing.
no wonder everyone's all freaked out.
McAllister's perfect debutante is in trouble.
read the note.
you think someone threatening to kill this girl is funny?
no, I think someone calling Cherish Hanson a virgin is funny.
you're a satanist, Mike?
sure.
and you worship the devil?
you know what satanism is?
educate us.
the word Satan comes from ancient Hebrew. It just means opposer.
Satan opposes the hypocritical morals and dogmas of the so-called holy church and its followers.
if you grew up in this town with god shoved down your throat every day you'd oppose it, too.
it's all hypocrisy. Do this. Don't do that.
and all the time, the adults are the ones screwing up.
so basically we're just atheists. Aggressively atheist.
how aggressive, Mike?
you're one of the FBI agents, aren't you?
is there something you want to tell me?
do you think god is vengeful?
I don't know.
you don't think he punishes us?
after hurricane Katrina, I read some essays by religious scholars.
one writer said god was punishing America for its immorality.
new Orleans was a wicked city, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
another one, a priest from New Orleans he thought the hurricane was proof of god's love.
those levees didn't break until after the storm was over.
if they'd broken sooner, thousands would've died.
so...
I guess the answer to your question depends on whether or not you think you have something to be punished for.
my friend Cherish...
she's missing.
and it's my fault.
I've got to give the sheriff a report.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
you guys need anything?
coffee would be nice.
he takes about a quart of sugar in it.
2 teaspoons is fine.
you got it.
you knew I didn't want you to tell Hotch about my nightmares.
Reid, that's something they need to know about.
what do you mean "they"?
Hotch and Gideon.
you told Gideon, too?
Yeah, and it's ok, kid.
what if they think I can't do my job?
what if they want to pull me off the team?
they won't. - Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
I just do.
you had no right, man. I--I confided in you.
you know, this is exactly what I get when I trust someone.
it gets thrown back in my face.
mine started 6 months after I got into the B. A.U.
Yeah. Mine.
we were working a strangler case in Montana.
four victims.
me, I was still pretty young at the time so you know, I was feeling myself.
I was cocky, I was arrogant.
the locals, they didn't have anything, so I stepped up.
I said I can nail down a profile for you just as soon as I can get what I need.
more victims?
she was found the next day.
so I went down to the scene to do my thing.
and as I was looking over the body, that's when I saw them.
her eyes, Reid.
they were wide open.
and there was something different about them it was like they were looking right at me.
like she knew.
I asked for a victim.
well, here she was.
that's when they started for me.
night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eyes.
they were dead eyes. Accusing eyes.
and it got to the point where it was happening even when I wasn't asleep.
Reid, everywhere I went, I saw those eyes.
what did you do?
he knew. I didn't tell him.
I was like you. I didn't want anybody to know.
he just...he knew.
and he sat me down and he just kind of talked me through it.
I still have the nightmares to this day, just not nearly as often.
but when they come back, I know how to handle them better.
what did he say?
did you find her?
no.
did Zizzo say anything?
we don't know. We've been here the whole time.
cory, calm down.
how am I supposed to calm down?
cherish is missing. Did you check all over?
we searched the whole house.
what about the outbuilding?
outbuilding?
did you check the other area? Back in the woods?
I didn't know there was another area.
Yeah, it's like a sluice structure or something.
he took me there once. It's this way.
let's go.
the skeleton under the tree, he died a year ago.
he fell off the trail, cracked his head open.
he was just some tourist or something.
how do you know that?
we went to see the body all the time.
we watched it decompose.
who did?
we did. Everybody, the whole group.
what the hell is this?
why don't you tell us, Mike?
I've never seen this before.
pentagram, body, candles, L. O.D.
lords of destruction.
I've never seen this.
from where I stand, Mike, it looks like you signed it.
at first we were just curious, you know?
we would go, a couple of us at a time, show each other.
none of us had ever seen a dead body before.
and then it kind of became our thing.
something that we had that our parents didn't know about.
it was ours.
this was a human being.
I told you that we're being punished.
it's up here.
this is our secret place.
I can't believe this is happening.
this kind of thing doesn't happen in McAllister.
you said you read the profiling books.
you know bad things happen anywhere. Anywhere at anytime.
she in there?
is she all right?
cory, she's in there.
is she dead?
she can't be dead.
look, we drew our stars upside-down, get drunk, and listen to metal.
that's it. Hey, we don't kill people.
this is your chance to make this right, Zizzo.
you don't want to make it right.
you wanna blame someone who doesn't conform to your view of how people should act and think.
I need to talk to you, all of you.
Reid, I want you to go to the house and see if the deputies have come back.
what?
we need the sheriff and the crime scene team here.
but-- - Reid. Do it.
I can't--I can't believe Cherish
I'm sorry about your friend.
I saw her the other day.
it was a pep rally.
I've been with Brandy Dreifort. Do you know her?
she's a friend of my son's.
she's a friend of Cherish's, too.
And?
well, they all knew about the skeleton.
who did?
football team, cheerleaders, everyone.
they all watched this man decompose like it was a game for their amusement.
what?
as far as I can tell the only kids in that area who didn't know were Mike Zizzo and the L. O.D.
it's ridiculous.
sounds impossible, it's unbelievable.
she told me all about it.
the guy was a hiker or something.
probably have him listed, missing person somewhere.
Jason how do you know the L. O.D. wasn't involved?
well, she said the pentagram and the candles they weren't there a few months ago.
which means?
someone wanted us to believe there were satanists here.
Reid tells me you've read all the profiling books.
actually kinda hoping to be one of you guys someday.
are ya? So then you know what profilers do?
the unsub likes to inject himself into the investigation.
that's what this type of killer does.
who gave us is Zizzo?
who knew all about him?
you're talking about Cory?
it was convenient, wasn't it?
lucky we had a kid right in the room who could tell us where the L. O.D. was.
a group of fringe kids nobody in the town would like.
but you called us here to advise you.
my advice would be to get in front of this before your son hurts himself or anybody else.
you know where he is, sheriff?
he went up to the Jenson house to see if your guys found anything on Cherish.
morgan and Reid are out there right now.
Hey, sheriff. Did you open the gun locker?
no.
someone did. There's a revolver missing.
you know that we look at a crime scene from a different perspective than regular cops, right?
we look for more than just the evidence.
we try to pick up on the behavior of the killer.
for example, the guy we're looking for in this crime would be classified as a disorganized killer.
sounds like Zizzo, doesn't it?
Yeah. Sure it does.
but then again, sometimes a disorganized killer only looks disorganized.
sometimes it's actually an organized guy, and pretty smart guy.
somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else did it.
because of that, we also gotta look for someone who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation so that he can influence things.
especially if he knows exactly what it is that we're looking for.
I mean, he wants to control this, right?
and that would extend to discovery.
wantin' the body found when and especially where he wants that body found.
you mean me?
this was more than just a lucky guess, wasn't it?
I knew about the building.
you also knew about Zizzo and the satanism.
I was only trying to help.
well, you did that.
we couldn't have found this place without you.
hey Morgan, no one's up there.
get over here. - Reid. Reid.
Cory. - This got all messed up.
don't be stupid.
she wasn't supposed to be with him.
it was his run. He runs it every day, not her.
cory, listen to me. We can fix this.
but you've got to let Reid go.
I never meant to hurt her. But make no mistake
I will shoot your boy right now.
no, you won't.
tempt not a desperate man.
put the gun down. - Okay all right. You win.
drop it. Drop the gun!
OK. Ok. You win.
I'm putting the gun down.
you're in control, Cory. Let him go.
for the evil is man's best force. Man must become better and eviler.
that's what this is about, right?
Zarathustra? The superman?
there's no moral obligation for killing someone if you're superior to them?
but nietzsche was speaking metaphorically about evolving as a species.
you're just a horny kid who wanted to get rid of the cheerleader's boyfriend.
no. - Yes.
that was never my intent
come on.
you all right?
what happened?
him bringing us down here was way too much of a coincidence.
I got that.
but did you have to tackle us both?
you're welcome, Reid.
C'mon. Let's go, Cory.
playwright Eugene Ionesco said "ideologies separate us, dreams and anguish bring us together.
deborah Louise Addison. Her husband Tim.
the kids are Amber and Keith. Eight and six.
in 1985, Deborah Louise was walking home from school.
she was abducted. She was 13.
we profiled the unsub.
and we were able to locate her before he harmed her.
she writes a letter to the B. A.U. every year.
she updates us on her life.
it's nice, but
we all have bad dreams.
everyone on the plane. Who wouldn't?
we hunt the worst of humanity we see the depths of depravity, we dream of monsters.
in my dream there's a baby in the middle of a circle and there's someone on the other side.
and I can't get to her before
every night I look at Deborah helps me to go to sleep thinking of the victims we've saved.
we don't always beat the monsters to the babies but we do enough to make the job worth it keep the nightmares bearable.
how much farther?
what?
are we almost done?
you want to stop?
no.
let's rest a while.
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.
you go ahead. I'll catch up.
I can wait.
Adam, please. It's your workout.
go. I'll meet you at the point.
you're out of shape, cheerleader.
Oh, yeah?
let's see you do 3 back flips and land in the splits.
the point?
the point.
Hello?
is somebody there?
if you're trying to scare me, I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my god. Adam, please wake up. Adam.
baby, please, baby. Please!
Noooo!
victim's the Loyd boy, isn't it?
the quarterback?
just saw his parents yesterday heading up to Nantucket.
listen get me their number up there, will you?
sheriff Bridges.
there's something here.
what is it?
you're gonna want to see this, sir.
looks like the head is busted open.
just like Adam Loyd.
you want me to get the crime scene folks down here?
Yeah.
wait. Hold on.
we're gonna need a lot more than the crime scene folks.
easy there, tough guy. Have some coffee with your sugar.
I need something to wake me up.
Ooh. Late night?
very.
my man.
not that kind of late night.
OK, so tell me, what does keep young Dr. Reid awake at night?
wait, let me guess.
memorizing some obscure textbook.
no, no, no, no.
working on cold fusion.
no, I got it.
watching Star Trek... and laughing at the physics mistakes.
actually, there aren't that many scientific errors in Star Trek.
especially considering how long ago it was made.
there are certain improbabilities, but not that many outright errors.
right.
Hey, Morgan?
uh, do you ever have dreams?
I'm sorry.
I guess nightmares would be a more accurate description.
is that what's keeping you up?
I used to get them occasionally but lately it's like I have them every night.
what are they about?
this. What we do.
do you have nightmares?
Reid, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for you to talk to about this.
why not?
it's just, uh...
did you ask Gideon about it?
no.
you should.
Hey, Hotch wants everyone in the round table room.
something up with you two?
no.
McAllister. Western slope of Massanutten mountain in Virginia.
2 bodies discovered in the woods both with apparent blunt trauma to the head.
skeletons?
one of them. The second victim was just killed this morning.
how do we know there's a connection?
they were found about 75 feet apart with nearly identical head wounds.
Where's the rest of the case file?
there isn't one. The sheriffs are on the scene waiting for us.
their location is only a half hour away by plane.
what's the rush?
well, there was evidence on the scene that could cause a bit of a public uproar.
a satanic cult.
so Peter Ustinov said, "unfortunately a super-abundance of dreams is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares.
JJ, we need to obviously, keep this out of the press for as long as possible.
I'll do what I can.
why is that so important?
there was a nationwide scare in the 1980s involving satanic ritual killings and abuse.
the satanic panic, it was called.
it began after the publication of a book about repressed memories being recovered through hypnotherapy.
memories of growing up with devil worshippers who use children in their rituals and ceremonies.
most of the claims were later found to be false or just impossible.
still, numerous therapists accepted the assertions as true and began searching for similar signs in their own patients.
after one year, thousands of people reported the exact same repressed memories.
the bureau conducted an investigation and concluded that most of the most of the ritual killings or abuse were more urban legend than anything else.
you're saying that there's no such thing as devil worship?
not at all.
but most of the satanism that we've seen is juveniles damaging property, desecrating churches, cemeteries.
to my knowledge, there has never been a proven case of a satanic ritual killing in the united states.
well, maybe there is now.
mornin'.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
I'm agent Jareau, and this is agent Gideon and Dr. Reid with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
Hi.
thanks for coming out so fast.
Yeah. Of course.
there was an in-service in Charlottesville last year said if we ran into any unusual homicides we were supposed to call you folks sooner rather than later.
Yeah, they were right.
is this unusual enough?
it certainly is interesting.
you guys must get a lot of this, huh?
satanic stuff?
not really.
who found the bodies?
a hiker found the first one at the trail and my deputies located this one while searching for evidence.
we don't even know if it's a man or a woman.
it's a man.
the male pelvis is more narrow and the opening at the bottom is heart-shaped, as opposed to oval.
melted wax?
candle wax?
candles are used in rituals.
they're also used on birthday cakes.
actually, they were originally used to protect the birthday celebrant from demons for the coming year.
as a matter of fact, down to the fourth century christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual.
what kind of doctor are you?
he was kind of a local hero.
a high school football star.
so a pretty strong kid, huh?
I know he used to run out here on the mountain all the time.
that's not easy.
was he out here running today?
he was wearing sweats.
a crime of opportunity or was the unsub laying in wait for this kid specifically?
unsub?
unknown subject. The killer.
if it is a cult, do you think they cared who the victim was?
maybe. Maybe not.
so we're talking about a blitz attack on a high-risk victim
one who could defend himself with a weapon picked up at the scene.
disorganized offender. It could be a cult.
the manson crime scenes were textbook disorganized murder.
this looks like a heavily traveled area.
a lot of the locals walk these paths.
some tourists, too.
if you are gonna conduct a ritual killing?
would you do it in the middle of a traveled path?
well, if the other crime scene was a ritual site where the pentagram is
I might blitz the victim here and drag him to the other scene.
why didn't they?
does "lod" mean anything to you?
Uh-uh. I don't know of any significance in satanism, either.
well, I could have Garcia research this "lod" thing if I could get a call out.
not much of a chance of that out here.
are there any cults in the area that you know about?
secret groups?
people you see you don't know much about people who stay to themselves mostly.
this is a very religious area.
church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.
if there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.
that's an inherent contradiction.
excuse me?
he means if there was a group being secretive you probably wouldn't know.
look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.
what I know is none of them are capable of doing this.
find anything interesting down there?
Yeah, it does look like some kind of ritual site.
have any of you ever heard the expression "lod" or the acronym "L. O.D."?
not me.
sheriff Bridges!
it's ok, Harris. Let her in.
was Adam Loyd killed out here?
who told you that, Veronica?
was he? My daughter was with him.
they were out running together this morning.
Oh, my god. I can't find her. Cherish is missing.
cherish is missing!
help me, please.
take her home.
we're looking for someone who can overpower our victim abduct a girl from a traveled path without being seen.
it certainly fits with the cult theory.
more than one unsub to control multiple victims.
but if the attack were ferocious enough a single unsub could, too.
kill Adam and grab the girl while she's in shock.
this is some rough country.
we only went 1/4 of a mile, and we almost got lost.
the unsub has to be from this area.
you don't just stumble onto a place like this.
JJ, where'd the sheriff go?
he's setting up a search party.
tell him I want him to use volunteers from the area. Locals.
do you want him to know why?
no, not yet.
is it wise to alienate him?
well, he thinks we're looking for a monster.
if we tell him we're looking for volunteers so we can profile who shows up he might call the whole thing off.
state won't be here for over an hour. We're not gonna wait.
I want you to gather everyone up and I'm going to assign grid locations.
Yes, sir.
you have a moment, sheriff?
I've got a missing girl, 100 square miles of woods, not enough men and in a couple of hours it's going to be dark.
have you considered using the people that live in the area?
I'm not gonna have civilians messing up the crime scene.
we can instruct them not to touch anything until a member of law enforcement arrives.
what if they get lost, too?
we can have them sign in to a volunteer sheet and keep track of what grid square they're in.
look...I grew up in a small town.
you have the state police coming in?
Yeah.
your locals can do a better job of finding this girl than any statie.
you know that.
you'll keep track of 'em?
I've coordinated searches all over the country.
let's go.
Harris, I'm going downtown.
don't do anything until I get back, all right?
Hey, can I come with you guys?
I need to call Quantico and have them research that whole "lod" thing.
Yeah, sure. Hop in.
what's happened, John?
Reverend Paul Burke, this is
I'm sorry, I forgot your names.
I'm agent Jareau. This is Dr. Reid.
they're with the FBI.
FBI? It's true, then? Adam's dead?
cherish Hanson's missing, too.
is there anything I can do?
actually, yes. We're putting together a search party.
could you call the congregation?
of course. Of course. I'll go make some calls.
Thanks, Reverend. This way.
use any phone, doc, you just dial 9 to get an outside line.
I've got an emergency phone list back here in my office.
did you play ball?
no.
Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, either, if not for my father.
I'm Cory.
who's that, nietzsche?
thus spake zarathustra" was rather antagonistic of the judeo-christian world view for this town, isn't it?
I don't think too many people here would've bothered to read it.
if they had, they wouldn't understand it.
might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory.
nobody ever got that reference before.
is my father around?
the sheriff?
he's in his office with another agent.
agent?
I'm with the FBI, behavioral analysis unit.
Profilers?
ha. This is mad cool.
I got, like 100 questions I go
wait. Why would FBI profilers be here in McAllister?
there was a murder outside of town on the mountain.
a murder?
a girl's missing.
it's Cherish, son.
we're putting together a search party.
I need you to get the rest of the team together and meet us out at the trail about 1/2 mile south of the point.
Yeah. Ok.
came as soon as I heard, sheriff.
good morning, Henry.
sign in with this lady here then just stand by for a few minutes.
everyone, please, as soon as you've signed in make your way back to the police cars.
that's where you'll be assigned your groups. Thank you.
I grew up in Brooklyn.
you couldn't get this many people out for anything less than free money.
well, here come the jocks and cheerleaders.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
now, you're all assigned grid squares to search.
each grid has a deputy or an FBI agent.
you find anything, do not touch it.
just let your grid leader know.
now, are there any questions?
all right. Everyone get in your group now.
all right, you guys, let's head out.
you have the sign-in sheets?
Yeah.
is Garcia standing by to do background on them all?
I got a deputy waiting to take me back to the station.
I'm gonna fax her soon as I get there.
good. This type of unsub can't resist injecting himself into a show like this.
he's here with us.
man, this is one peyton place of a town.
most everyone lives well above the median income of the country.
you got doctors, lawyers...
one guy owns a bunch of shoe stores up and down the eastern seaboard.
ha. Is he married?
Yeah. Story of my life, sunshine.
Reverend Paul Burke, looks like he became born again in prison.
prison?
Yeah, 2 years as a guest of the state of Ohio for embezzlement.
I'm seeing a lot of tax sheltering and various hanky-panky here but I'm not sure what would suggest potential satanic cult members hold on.
wait, you got something?
Yeah, I got a guy with a ton of debts spotty work history, his house is in foreclosure.
he's got a record, too assault with a deadly weapon 3 years ago.
wait. Does it say what the weapon was?
baseball bat.
our unsub used a blunt object.
bats are blunt, aren't they?
what's this guy's name?
OK. Here he is. "Grid b-5." Ok, that puts him with...Elle.
you all right there?
way to scare a girl.
saw you bent over.
I was tying my shoe.
these almost never come untied.
good for you.
my name's Henry.
well, then good for you, Henry.
I'm Elle.
like the letter?
that's a different kind of name.
had it all my life.
that's funny. Your whole life.
you're with the FBI, right?
that must be exciting.
it has its moments.
it's dangerous, too, right?
I mean, you go after killers and things.
really bad guys.
you ever have to shoot
Satan commands the virgin be sacrificed at the next full moon.
that's tonight, isn't it?
Wh--what's that?
blood.
tired?
I'm fine.
we all get them sometimes.
get what?
nightmares.
it's not that bad.
you want to talk about it, you know where I am.
uh, they're ready.
okay.
contrary to popular belief there has never been a proven case of satanic ritual killing.
never a verified human sacrifice.
having said that, there have been isolated cases of animal sacrifice...
many, many cases of vandalism in the name of satan.
but that doesn't mean that ritual satanism is impossible.
more importantly, for our purposes there have been cults that killed, just not in ritual fashion.
the Reverend Jim Jones and the peoples temple...
his followers killed a U. S. Congressman and 3 people before committing mass suicide and leaving over 900 people dead.
and perhaps the most widely-known of the killer cults the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson killed 9 people in a 4-day period in an attempt to initiate a race war.
killer cults do exist, and they all have one thing in common...
invariably they're headed by charismatic megalomaniacs.
you're looking for that leader. He's who will stand out.
he'll be memorable to somebody, people who aren't in his group will see him as strange, weird, scary.
since we're dealing with professed satanists which is often practiced by younger males we may be looking for teenagers.
heavy metal music is often associated with satanism and these kids and their leader may reflect that in their look.
most likely, there'll be sex, drugs and alcohol.
and the leader, he'll be older.
it's part of his charm.
and he is from this area.
he's definitely local.
these woods are too thick and confusing for a visitor to get around in.
you think one of our own people is doing this?
we're sure of it.
I would know if someone was capable of doing
dad. I know somebody like that.
his name's Mike Zizzo.
he graduated about 5 years ago.
he's in his 20s, but he still hangs out with high school kids.
he's got a group of them.
they follow him everywhere.
they all get high and listen to heavy metal.
he calls them the lords of destruction.
how do you know this, Cory?
it's all right, son.
I've been there, where they hang out drinking beers.
he talks about Satan all the time.
says he's the one true god.
where is this place?
on the other side of the mountain. The old Jenson house.
it's out of my jurisdiction.
not ours.
sorry, dad.
I'm not going on the raid.
what's up?
I don't know yet.
FBI! Don't move!
I said turn the music down now!
up against the wall! Everybody up against the wall now!
up against the wall!
do you believe in god?
excuse me?
do you believe in god?
Yes.
how about the devil?
is someone going to tell me why I'm here or are we just going to play staring games all night?
this was found where Cherish Hanson went missing.
no wonder everyone's all freaked out.
McAllister's perfect debutante is in trouble.
read the note.
you think someone threatening to kill this girl is funny?
no, I think someone calling Cherish Hanson a virgin is funny.
you're a satanist, Mike?
sure.
and you worship the devil?
you know what satanism is?
educate us.
the word Satan comes from ancient Hebrew. It just means opposer.
Satan opposes the hypocritical morals and dogmas of the so-called holy church and its followers.
if you grew up in this town with god shoved down your throat every day you'd oppose it, too.
it's all hypocrisy. Do this. Don't do that.
and all the time, the adults are the ones screwing up.
so basically we're just atheists. Aggressively atheist.
how aggressive, Mike?
you're one of the FBI agents, aren't you?
is there something you want to tell me?
do you think god is vengeful?
I don't know.
you don't think he punishes us?
after hurricane Katrina, I read some essays by religious scholars.
one writer said god was punishing America for its immorality.
new Orleans was a wicked city, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
another one, a priest from New Orleans he thought the hurricane was proof of god's love.
those levees didn't break until after the storm was over.
if they'd broken sooner, thousands would've died.
so...
I guess the answer to your question depends on whether or not you think you have something to be punished for.
my friend Cherish...
she's missing.
and it's my fault.
I've got to give the sheriff a report.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
you guys need anything?
coffee would be nice.
he takes about a quart of sugar in it.
2 teaspoons is fine.
you got it.
you knew I didn't want you to tell Hotch about my nightmares.
Reid, that's something they need to know about.
what do you mean "they"?
Hotch and Gideon.
you told Gideon, too?
Yeah, and it's ok, kid.
what if they think I can't do my job?
what if they want to pull me off the team?
they won't. - Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
I just do.
you had no right, man. I--I confided in you.
you know, this is exactly what I get when I trust someone.
it gets thrown back in my face.
mine started 6 months after I got into the B. A.U.
Yeah. Mine.
we were working a strangler case in Montana.
four victims.
me, I was still pretty young at the time so you know, I was feeling myself.
I was cocky, I was arrogant.
the locals, they didn't have anything, so I stepped up.
I said I can nail down a profile for you just as soon as I can get what I need.
more victims?
she was found the next day.
so I went down to the scene to do my thing.
and as I was looking over the body, that's when I saw them.
her eyes, Reid.
they were wide open.
and there was something different about them it was like they were looking right at me.
like she knew.
I asked for a victim.
well, here she was.
that's when they started for me.
night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eyes.
they were dead eyes. Accusing eyes.
and it got to the point where it was happening even when I wasn't asleep.
Reid, everywhere I went, I saw those eyes.
what did you do?
he knew. I didn't tell him.
I was like you. I didn't want anybody to know.
he just...he knew.
and he sat me down and he just kind of talked me through it.
I still have the nightmares to this day, just not nearly as often.
but when they come back, I know how to handle them better.
what did he say?
did you find her?
no.
did Zizzo say anything?
we don't know. We've been here the whole time.
cory, calm down.
how am I supposed to calm down?
cherish is missing. Did you check all over?
we searched the whole house.
what about the outbuilding?
outbuilding?
did you check the other area? Back in the woods?
I didn't know there was another area.
Yeah, it's like a sluice structure or something.
he took me there once. It's this way.
let's go.
the skeleton under the tree, he died a year ago.
he fell off the trail, cracked his head open.
he was just some tourist or something.
how do you know that?
we went to see the body all the time.
we watched it decompose.
who did?
we did. Everybody, the whole group.
what the hell is this?
why don't you tell us, Mike?
I've never seen this before.
pentagram, body, candles, L. O.D.
lords of destruction.
I've never seen this.
from where I stand, Mike, it looks like you signed it.
at first we were just curious, you know?
we would go, a couple of us at a time, show each other.
none of us had ever seen a dead body before.
and then it kind of became our thing.
something that we had that our parents didn't know about.
it was ours.
this was a human being.
I told you that we're being punished.
it's up here.
this is our secret place.
I can't believe this is happening.
this kind of thing doesn't happen in McAllister.
you said you read the profiling books.
you know bad things happen anywhere. Anywhere at anytime.
she in there?
is she all right?
cory, she's in there.
is she dead?
she can't be dead.
look, we drew our stars upside-down, get drunk, and listen to metal.
that's it. Hey, we don't kill people.
this is your chance to make this right, Zizzo.
you don't want to make it right.
you wanna blame someone who doesn't conform to your view of how people should act and think.
I need to talk to you, all of you.
Reid, I want you to go to the house and see if the deputies have come back.
what?
we need the sheriff and the crime scene team here.
but-- - Reid. Do it.
I can't--I can't believe Cherish
I'm sorry about your friend.
I saw her the other day.
it was a pep rally.
I've been with Brandy Dreifort. Do you know her?
she's a friend of my son's.
she's a friend of Cherish's, too.
And?
well, they all knew about the skeleton.
who did?
football team, cheerleaders, everyone.
they all watched this man decompose like it was a game for their amusement.
what?
as far as I can tell the only kids in that area who didn't know were Mike Zizzo and the L. O.D.
it's ridiculous.
sounds impossible, it's unbelievable.
she told me all about it.
the guy was a hiker or something.
probably have him listed, missing person somewhere.
Jason how do you know the L. O.D. wasn't involved?
well, she said the pentagram and the candles they weren't there a few months ago.
which means?
someone wanted us to believe there were satanists here.
Reid tells me you've read all the profiling books.
actually kinda hoping to be one of you guys someday.
are ya? So then you know what profilers do?
the unsub likes to inject himself into the investigation.
that's what this type of killer does.
who gave us is Zizzo?
who knew all about him?
you're talking about Cory?
it was convenient, wasn't it?
lucky we had a kid right in the room who could tell us where the L. O.D. was.
a group of fringe kids nobody in the town would like.
but you called us here to advise you.
my advice would be to get in front of this before your son hurts himself or anybody else.
you know where he is, sheriff?
he went up to the Jenson house to see if your guys found anything on Cherish.
morgan and Reid are out there right now.
Hey, sheriff. Did you open the gun locker?
no.
someone did. There's a revolver missing.
you know that we look at a crime scene from a different perspective than regular cops, right?
we look for more than just the evidence.
we try to pick up on the behavior of the killer.
for example, the guy we're looking for in this crime would be classified as a disorganized killer.
sounds like Zizzo, doesn't it?
Yeah. Sure it does.
but then again, sometimes a disorganized killer only looks disorganized.
sometimes it's actually an organized guy, and pretty smart guy.
somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else did it.
because of that, we also gotta look for someone who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation so that he can influence things.
especially if he knows exactly what it is that we're looking for.
I mean, he wants to control this, right?
and that would extend to discovery.
wantin' the body found when and especially where he wants that body found.
you mean me?
this was more than just a lucky guess, wasn't it?
I knew about the building.
you also knew about Zizzo and the satanism.
I was only trying to help.
well, you did that.
we couldn't have found this place without you.
hey Morgan, no one's up there.
get over here. - Reid. Reid.
Cory. - This got all messed up.
don't be stupid.
she wasn't supposed to be with him.
it was his run. He runs it every day, not her.
cory, listen to me. We can fix this.
but you've got to let Reid go.
I never meant to hurt her. But make no mistake
I will shoot your boy right now.
no, you won't.
tempt not a desperate man.
put the gun down. - Okay all right. You win.
drop it. Drop the gun!
OK. Ok. You win.
I'm putting the gun down.
you're in control, Cory. Let him go.
for the evil is man's best force. Man must become better and eviler.
that's what this is about, right?
Zarathustra? The superman?
there's no moral obligation for killing someone if you're superior to them?
but nietzsche was speaking metaphorically about evolving as a species.
you're just a horny kid who wanted to get rid of the cheerleader's boyfriend.
no. - Yes.
that was never my intent
come on.
you all right?
what happened?
him bringing us down here was way too much of a coincidence.
I got that.
but did you have to tackle us both?
you're welcome, Reid.
C'mon. Let's go, Cory.
playwright Eugene Ionesco said "ideologies separate us, dreams and anguish bring us together.
deborah Louise Addison. Her husband Tim.
the kids are Amber and Keith. Eight and six.
in 1985, Deborah Louise was walking home from school.
she was abducted. She was 13.
we profiled the unsub.
and we were able to locate her before he harmed her.
she writes a letter to the B. A.U. every year.
she updates us on her life.
it's nice, but
we all have bad dreams.
everyone on the plane. Who wouldn't?
we hunt the worst of humanity we see the depths of depravity, we dream of monsters.
in my dream there's a baby in the middle of a circle and there's someone on the other side.
and I can't get to her before
every night I look at Deborah helps me to go to sleep thinking of the victims we've saved.
we don't always beat the monsters to the babies but we do enough to make the job worth it keep the nightmares bearable.
wake UP.
wake UP, SLEEPY HEAD.
took the cursed sheet again you hairy bastard.
all these bad dreams u have.
U should pay extra.
be QET, WOMAN.
POSCA.
Lucius VORENUS.
your MONTHLY DEBAUCH IS FINISHED ALREADY?
I SEE YOURS ISN'T.
this? THIS IS NOTHING.
this IS FOR MY NERVES.
where IS HE?
Oh, WHERE IS HE?
Oh, A DEEP QUESTION.
his MORTAL FLESH IS IN THE THRONE ROOM MEETING THE DELEGATION FROM THE SENATE.
they're HERE ALREADY? - YES.
senator BIBULUS AND SEVERAL OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEN WHOSE NAMES I FORGET ARRIVED THIS MORNING.
and WHY ARE YOU NOT IN THERE?
I VALUE MY LIFE, SUCH AS IT IS.
when THE QUEEN GROWLS AT ME, I RETREAT.
hmm.
it's NOT COWARDICE.
who WOULD LOOK AFTER MY WIFE?
Antony: YOU SHOULD LEAD THE ANIMAL ON SLIGHTLY.
you SEE? DEPENDING ON HOW FAST HE'S GOING.
drink THE WATER.
now HERE'S THE MOMENT
the ANIMAL THINKS ONLY OF HIS THIRST.
he KNOWS THERE IS DANGER.
but HE CANNOT RESIST THE WATER.
easy, YOU SEE.
my TURN.
Antony, IF WE MIGHT DISCUSS THE MATTER AT HAND?
Shh! - SHH!
you'll SCARE OFF THE DEER.
Oh. - HE MOVED.
the BEAST MOVED! - AGAIN.
regarding THE GRAIN SUPPLY...
I HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO OFFER YOU DOUBLE THE PREVIOUS PRICE IF YOU CAN GUARANTEE DELIVERY BEFORE THE END OF THE MONTH.
double YOU SAY?
that's NOT BAD.
Oh!
triple. - AGREED.
we WILL PAY TRIPLE THE CORRECT PRICE.
and CARTHAGE.
Carthage WILL BE ANNEXED TO ANTONY'S CONTROL.
that MAY BE POSSIBLE.
poor OCTAVIAN, EH?
he MUST BE REALLY DESPERATE.
people ARE STARVING, DYING.
Octavian WILL DO WHAT HE MUST TO PREVENT FURTHER SUFFERING.
because HE LOVES THE PEOPLE SO.
he DOES. - HE LOVES NOBODY AND NOBODY LOVES HIM.
he COULD FEED THE PEOPLE LARKS AND OYSTERS TILL THEY BURST, AND THEY WOULD STILL LOVE ME MORE.
isn't THAT RIGHT, VORENUS?
Yes, SIR.
there WE ARE. THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.
they LOVE ME.
I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT WE DO HAVE AN AGREEMENT, YES?
Yes.
triple RATES...
and CARTHAGE.
and SPAIN. - SPAIN?
you CAN'T HAVE SPAIN.
Oh?
Oh, THAT'S A SHAME. NO DEAL THEN.
really, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY-- - NO DEAL.
Oh, BRAVA, MY LOVE!
venison FOR DINNER, THEN?
pleasant VOYAGE HOME, BOYS.
get HIM OUT OF HERE.
I'll SHOW YOU TO YOUR QUARTERS.
is HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT? - LIKE WHAT?
well, IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE LITTLE SHIT DECLARE WAR,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.
he's A CAUTIOUS BEAST.
perhaps YOU SHOULD SIMPLY CUT THE CORD
and DECLARE WAR YOURSELF.
declare WAR...
on OCTAVIAN?
on MY MOST TRUSTED AND BELOVED COLLEAGUE?
on ROME? ON MY OWN PEOPLE? NO NO NO.
no, THAT WOULDN'T DO.
when I RETURN HOME IT WILL BE AS A SAVIOR, NOT AS A CONQUEROR.
I'm VERY TIRED.
Helios.
selene, OFF WITH YOU. OFF WITH YOU.
can't YOU SEE YOUR FATHER NEEDS TO SLEEP?
where ARE YOU GOING? STAY.
you CAN HEAR THEM.
what ARE YOU GONNA DO? BAKE 'EM A CAKE?
Oh, DIS.
I FORGET SOMETIMES WHAT A COLD-HEARTED BITCH YOU REALLY ARE.
would YOU HAVE ME ANY OTHER WAY?
are YOU JOKING?
anyone OFFERS ME A GOOD HORSE WITH THE LEATHERS THROWN IN...
- ...YOU'RE GONE.
man: BACK! BACK!
keep OUT OF THE WAY! GET OUT OF THE WAY!
let HIM THROUGH.
clear THE WAY.
man: MY FATHER IS STARVING.
silence.
Silence!
the DAY'S RATION HAS BEEN GIVEN.
there'll BE NO MORE UNTIL TOMORROW AT THE APPOINTED TIME.
all: NO!
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY.
but YOU'RE ALIVE.
if I DO AS YOU ASK AND OPEN THE GRANARIES,
you'll BE WELL-FED TODAY AND STARVING TOMORROW.
go HOME.
go HOME AND SUFFER WHAT THE EARTH MOTHER HAS SENT US.
and COME BACK TOMORROW.
right.
still IN ONE PIECE THEN, EH?
thought THEY MIGHT HAVE ATE YOU.
too MUCH GRISTLE ON THE BONE.
Lucius, GIRLS, I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO WAIT INSIDE.
I'll NOT COWER WHEN THERE'S BLOOD TO BE SPILLED.
Where's THE HONOR IN THAT?
when YOU'VE GOT HAIR ON YOUR CHIN YOU CAN TALK OF BLOOD.
VORENA, I EXPECTED BETTER. NEXT TIME DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.
they're JUST HUNGRY PEOPLE. THEY'D NOT HURT US.
hungry PEOPLE DO STRANGE THINGS.
then BLESSED ORBONA WILL PROTECT US.
well, RUN ALONG AND ASK HER TO SEND A GRAIN SHIP.
me AND MASCIUS HAVE TO TALK.
you TOO, LUCIUS.
go LEARN TO READ OR SOMETHING.
ha!
what's THE TALLY?
10 DAYS LEFT, A QUARTER RATION, GIVE OR TAKE.
gods BELOW.
hardly WORTH GIVING OUT.
just PROLONGING THE MISERY.
morning.
the BAKERS' GUILD MAN WAS 'ROUND EARLIER.
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SPEAK TO THEM.
nor DID I.
he SPOKE, I SAID NOTHING.
they're OFFERING 600 A SACK.
Yeah, 600 AND A FEW DEAD CHILDREN
for EVERY SACK THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM.
we're NOT IN THIS FOR PROFIT.
still, IT'S 600.
I PISS ON THE BAKERS' GUILD.
your CALL. - YES, IT IS.
why ARE YOU WASTING VALUABLE FOOD ON HIM STILL?
let THE POOR BASTARD DIE.
memmio?
no. HE REMINDS THE OTHER MEN TO STAY HONEST.
what's TO BE DONE, THEN?
fetch MY BEST CLOTHES. I'LL SEE IF HIS HONOR HAS ANY IDEAS.
Hey!
quiet, YOU.
eh!
you FUCKING HAIRY BASTARD.
so FAR IT'S JUST THE OLD AND THE SICK THAT ARE DYING.
but BY NEXT MOON, OUR GRANARIES WILL BE EMPTY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT DOGS MAKE GOOD EATING.
they DO.
taste LIKE PORK IF YOU COOK 'EM RIGHT.
all GONE. - AH, I WONDERED WHY THE NIGHTS WERE SO PEACEFUL.
no BARKING. - THIS IS NO MOMENT FOR WIT.
I WISH THERE WERE SOMETHING I COULD DO.
but THE STATE GRANARIES ARE NEAR AS EMPTY AS YOURS.
I CAN ONLY GIVE TO YOU BY TAKING FROM SOMEONE ELSE.
the MILITARY SILOS ARE UNTAPPED.
and THE ANMY NEEDS TO EAT.
well THEN, SEND THREE LEGIONS TO AFRICA.
let LEPIDUS FEED THEM.
that WOULD SUPPLY THE CITY WITH ENOUGH GRAIN FOR A MONTH.
have IT DONE.
it's ONLY A TEMPORARY SOLUTION, BUT IT'S THE BEST WE CAN OFFER.
I'll SEND YOU WHAT WE CAN SPARE. - THANK YOU.
Pullo.
tell ME WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
tell ME WHO THEY BLAME FOR THIS FAMINE.
you, THEY SAY.
you're THE MAN IN CHARGE.
not ANTONY?
they HEAR THE NEWS READERS SAYING
that HE'S HOLDING BACK THE SHIPMENTS AND ALL THAT.
but, WELL, IT'S ANTONY, ISN'T IT?
why WOULD HE STARVE THEM?
they've ALWAYS LOVED HIM AND HE'S ALWAYS LOVED TO BE LOVED.
whereas YOU...
well, YOU'RE YOU, AREN'T YOU?
cold AND HEARTLESS?
I'll NOT SAY THAT.
but YOU'VE NEVER BEEN THE AFFECTIONATE TYPE, NOW HAVE YOU?
thank YOU, PULLO.
I'll BE HEARING ABOUT THE GRAIN THEN, WILL I?
agrippa WILL SEE TO IT.
perhaps BIBULUS WILL SUCCEED? - NO, HE WON'T.
Antony's NOT ENTIRELY IRRATIONAL.
given ENOUGH MONEY, WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE?
Antony's NOT MOTIVATED BY MONEY.
he HOPES THE PEOPLE WILL RISE UP IN ANGER AND DEPOSE ME.
either THAT, OR HE SIMPLY WISHES TO PROVOKE ME INTO DECLARING WAR ON HIM.
has HE REALLY BECOME SO FOOLISH?
who KNOWS WHAT HE'S BECOME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS OUT THERE?
who KNOWS WHAT CLEOPATRA WHISPERS TO HIM?
he WAS ALWAYS A FOOL FOR HIS WOMEN.
if HE WANTS A WAR, WHY NOT GIVE IT TO HIM?
hmm, YOU HEARD PULLO.
you MIGHT AS WELL DECLARE WAR ON WINE AND SONG.
no NO NO.
war ON ANTONY IS DOOMED UNLESS THE PEOPLE ARE WITH US.
send FOR MY MOTHER AND SISTER.
I SHALL HAVE DINNER WITH THEM THIS EVENING.
girl: GRANDMA?
you SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
Oh!
it's DANGEROUS.
antonia, WHERE ARE YOU?
she's UP HERE WITH ME. I'LL BRING HER DOWN.
you NAUGHTY GIRL.
what HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT GOING ON THE ROOF?
I SWEAR ON DIANA, I SHALL HAVE SOMEONE BEAT HER.
she DOESN'T LIEN TO A WORD I SAY.
Oh, SHE'S A GOOD GIRL, REALLY. JUST LIKE YOU WERE AT THAT AGE.
and I TURNED OUT SO WELL?
your BROTHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS AS BIDDABLE AS A SHEPHERD'S DOG.
no TROUBLE AT ALL.
castor, ARE THERE ANY LETTERS FOR ME TODAY?
no, DOMINA.
strange.
I HAD THE STRONGEST FEELING THAT TODAY WAS THE DAY.
mother? THERE WILL BE NO LETTER.
you're WRONG.
sorry TO BE BLUNT, BUT
but DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO FACE FACTS?
Antony PROMISED HE WOULD SEND FOR ME AND HE WILL.
even IF HE DID, DO YOU THINK OCTAVIAN WOULD LET YOU GO?
I DON'T GIVE A FIG.
truly, IS HE WORTH TORTURING YOURSELF LIKE THIS?
domina?
Octavian CAESAR SUMMONS YOU BOTH FOR DINNER THIS EVENING.
what DOES HE WANT NOW, I WONDER.
nothing TO OUR BENEFIT.
family AND FRIENDS, EH?
nothing BETTER.
Octavia, I HAVE A FAVOR TO ASK OF YOU.
- YOU ARE AWARE OF THE GRAIN SHORTAGE, I SUPPOSE?
you KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS FOR WANT OF BREAD?
and YOU WANT ME TO FEED THEM?
in A MANNER OF SPEAKING.
your HUSBAND HAS PLENTY OF GRAIN IN YPT.
but HE IS PLAYING POLITICS WITH IT, HOLDING IT BACK.
if YOU WERE TO GO AND TALK TO HIM...
I?
go TO EGYPT?
the SOFT VOICE OF A LOVING WIFE MAY SUCCEED WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
you ARE JOKING!
I CANNOT REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I MADE A JOKE.
last MARKET DAY.
you SAID SOMETHING ABOUT FISHES WHICH MADE ME LAUGH QUITE DISTINCTLY.
I WAS SPEAKING FIGURATIVELY.
if YOU ARE SERIOUS, IT IS NOT I WHO SHOULD GO, BUT MOTHER. SHE'S HIS REAL WIFE.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT GO TOGETHER, PRESENT ANTONY WITH BOTH REALITY AND APPEARANCE.
Oh.
that's ALL VERY WELL, BUT...
I HAVE NO DESIRE TO TAKE A LONG SEA VOYAGE.
do YOU?
no.
BESIS, WE'RE NOT HUNGRY.
and WE NEED NO GRAIN.
so WHAT'S IN IT FOR US?
how WILL YOU PAY US FOR OUR TROUBLE?
what DO YOU WANT?
hmm.
Pompeii's BECOME VULGAR.
I'd LIKE A VILLA IN CAPRI.
that's FINE.
what ABOUT YOU, OCTAVIA? DO YOU WANT A VILLA?
um, I DON'T KNOW.
a VILLA WOULD BE NICE.
some GLADIATORS WOULD BE FUN AS WELL.
why NOT TAKE CASH AND DECIDE LATER?
good IDEA.
cash. - AS YOU WISH.
MAECENAS, HAVE THE NEWS READER
announce THEY ARE LEAVING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
I LIKE BIRDS.
I DON'T LIKE EGGS. THERE IS SOMETHING QUITE SORDID ABOUT EGGS.
we SHAN'T SERVE THEM ANYMORE.
unless YOU OBJECT, OF COURSE.
why ARE YOU SENDING ATIA AND OCTAVIA TO EGYPT?
you HEARD WHY.
well, YES, BUT THAT CAN'T BE THE REAL REASON.
you KNOW ANTONY WILL REFUSE WHAT THEY ASK.
it's VERY LIKELY.
Oh.
what?
you CALCULATE...
that IF ANTONY TURNS OCTAVIA AWAY,
the PEOPLE WILL FEEL THAT HE HAS PUBLICLY HUMILIATED HIS DARLING WIFE, THAT QUEEN CLEOPATRA HAS BEWITCHED HIM,
and THEY WILL ALL TURN AGAINST HIM.
something LIKE THAT.
but ON THE OTHER HAND, IF ANTONY STILL LOVES ATIA AND YIELDS TO HER PLEADING,
then SO MUCH THE BETTER.
you'll HAVE YOUR GRAIN.
clever BOY.
good NIGHT, MY DEAR.
I WISH YOU'D STOP THAT.
we'll GET THERE NO FASTER.
have I CHANGED AT ALL, DO YOU THINK, SINCE HE LAST SAW ME?
no.
you're JUST EXACTLY AS YOU WERE.
he'll FALL INTO YOUR ARMS IN A DELIRIUM OF LOVE.
do YOU MEAN THAT?
no.
U've BECOME VERY MEAN, YOU KNOW.
mean AND BITTER.
you've BECOME GIRLISH AND SENTIMENTAL.
it's DISGUSTING, FRANKLY.
no POINTS. NO POINTS.
I WASN'T READY.
- HA!
10 POINTS TO ME.
well DONE, MAJESTY. WELL DONE.
ready? - NO, WAIT!
I BEG THEE! WAIT!
useless OLD WOMAN. GO AWAY.
Vorenus, PLAY WITH ME.
throw IT PROPERLY.
come ON, THEN.
good CATCH.
tell ME MORE ABOUT MY FATHER.
I TOLD YOU ALL THAT I KNOW.
you've TOLD ME ONLY WHAT EVERY FOOL KNOWS.
he WAS A GREAT SOLDIER, THE PEOPLE LOVED HIM, BLAH BLAH BLAH.
tell ME WHAT HE WAS LIKE AS A MAN.
well, HE WAS
he WAS A GOOD MAN.
he WAS A GOOD MAN TO HAVE AS A FRIEND.
you WOULDN'T WANT HIM AS AN ENEMY.
he HAD A NASTY TEMPER WHEN HE WAS ROUSED.
when THE BATTLE WAS GOING HARD AND MEN WERE FALTERING, THAT'S WHEN YOU'D WANT TO SEE YOUR FATHER AT YOUR SIDE.
bravest MAN I'VE EVER KNOWN.
more.
fine HORSEMAN.
bad GAMBLER, THOUGH HE'D NEVER ADMIT IT.
he LIKED THE WOMEN.
he LIKED TO EAT.
he'd EAT THE WHOLE TABLE IF YOU'D LET HIM.
Really?
I've ALWAYS HEARD HE WAS VERY...
ABSTEMIOUSN HIS DIET.
Yeah, WELL, THAT WOULD BE RIGHT.
there's OTHERS KNEW HIM FAR BETTER THAN I DID.
where ARE THEY?
what's WRONG?
what DO YOU MEAN, HERE?
their SHIP DOCKED AN HOUR AGO.
they're ON THEIR WAY TO THE PALACE NOW.
and THEY REQUEST AN IMMEDIATE AUDIENCE WITH YOU!
how DELICIOUS. WIFE AND LOVER COME TOGETHER TO SEE YOU.
hush, WOMAN.
what DO THEY WANT? - I DON'T KNOW.
what SHALL I TELL THEM? THEY WILL BE HERE.
just, GIVE-- GIVE
give ME TIME TO THINK.
no.
they WOULD NOT HAVE COME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.
Octavian MUST HAVE SENT THEM HERE.
sent THEM TO DO WHAT?
Oh, WHY ELSE SEND MY WIFE
except TO EFFECT SOME KIND OF...
reconciliation.
well, YOU MUST REFUSE HER.
obviously, YES.
hmm, BUT THAT
that IS EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.
he IS FORCING ME TO CHOOSE PUBLICLY
between HER AND-- AND YOU.
and WHEN I TURN HER AWAY, WHICH I WILL, HE WILL HAVE HIS PREMISE FOR WAR.
then WHY SO GLUM?
you HAVE WHAT YOU WANTED. A WAR THAT HE WILL START, A WAR THAT YOU DID NOT SEEK.
still, I...
I DO NOT LIKE IT.
ha, HE IS
he IS STRIKING AT MY SUPPORT AMONGST THE PEOPLE.
he-- HE WILL THINK HE HAS OUTMANEUVERED ME.
what MATTER?
as LONG AS YOU WIN THE WAR.
Yes.
I SUPPOSE SO. - IN ANY CASE...
we MUST BE GRACIOUS HOSTS, NAY? - HM?
we SHALL THROW A LOVELY PARTY FOR THEM.
charmian, SEND FOR THE KITCHEN CHAMBERLAIN.
no NO NO. NO!
no? WE MUST BE HOSPITABLE.
you'd LOVE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU?
humiliating ATIA.
watching HER SQUIRM AS YOU PLAY THE QUEEN.
play THE QUEEN?
I AM A QUEEN.
you KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
no. NO, I DON'T.
you-- YOU JUST WANT TO
flaunt OUR LOVE IN FRONT OF HER.
why NOT?
we LOVE EACH OTHER, DON'T WE?
and YOU NO LONGER LOVE HER.
why SHOULD SHE NOT KNOW IT?
it's AN ACT OF KINDNESS.
stop HER PINING FOR YOU.
I'm NOT WRONG, AM I?
you DO NO LONGER LOVE HER.
of COURSE I NO LONGER LOVE HER.
you KNOW I NO LONGER LOVE HER.
but NEITHER DO I THINK SHE DESERVES PUBLIC HUMILIATION.
that IS THE WHOLE POINT.
that IS WHY THEY'RE HERE, TO BE HUMILIATED.
no, I DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS THAT.
else SHE WOULD NOT BE HERE.
I THINK HER FUCKING SON
has MANIPULATED HER INTO IT.
let's KILL THEM THEN.
what?
what DID YOU SAY?
Atia WILL NOT BE HUMILIAD...
because ATIA WILL BE DEAD.
Octavian WILL KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT A MAN TO BE OUTMANEUVERED.
it's PERFECT.
no. MY PEOPLE WILL DESPISE ME AS A WIFE-KILLER.
well, THEIR SHIP SANK ON THE WAY HOME.
no. - IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
no. I MEAN IT. NO!
I SEE. WELL, I THINK YOU ARE A COWARD!
or YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.
- WHICH IS IT?
which IS IT?
why DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH?
gods, WHAT A GHASTLY PLACE.
big, THOUGH.
it's A SURE SIGN OF VULGARITY.
ptolemies WERE ORIGINALLY GOAT-HERDS, YOU KNOW?
why ARE THE DOORS NOT OPEN?
Ah! NO!
this IS OUTRAGEOUS.
the RUDENESS.
it JUST GOES TO SHOW-- VULGAR.
royalty, INDEED.
this HEAT'S UNBEARABLE.
I THINK I'M GOING TO FAINT.
you WOULD THINK THEY WOULD BRING US WATER.
can't WE GO BACK TO THE SHIP? - ABSOLUTELY NOT.
we're STAYING HERE UNTIL THESE WRETCHED PEOPLE...
Oh, ABOUT BLOODY TIME.
hello.
Jocasta. IS IT YOU?
of COURSE IT'S ME. WHO ELSE WOULD I BE?
what's HAPPENED TO YOU?
Oh, THIS?
her MAJESTY DOESN'T LIKE THE ROMAN STYLE ON HER WOMEN.
quite IRRATIONAL ABOUT THE SUBJECT IF YOU ASK ME.
but ANYTHING FOR A QUIET LIFE, EH?
I RATHER LIKE IT NOW.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE? HAVE YOU COME FOR CROCODILE DAY?
that's WHAT I CALL IT ANYWAY. I CAN'T GET MY MOUTH AROUND THEIR LINGO.
she WILL SHRIEK.
but I JUST PRETEND I'M A LITTLE MAD, AND SHE LEAVES OFF.
why IS THE DOOR KEPT SHUT? WHY IS THERE NO ONE HERE TO GREET US?
Oh, I'M SURE THERE'LL BE SOMEONE ALONG IN A WHILE.
things MOVE... EVER SO SLOW AROUND HERE.
it's THE HEAT.
listen, WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE
and TELL ANTONY THAT WE'RE WAITING TO SEE HIM?
obviously, HE'S NOT BEEN INFORMED THAT WE'RE HE.
no ONE'S ALLOWED TO SPEAK TO ANTONY WITHOUT SHE SAYS SO.
except MY DEAR LITTLE POSCA.
and LUUS VORENUS, OF COURSE.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT. IS THAT HOW PEOPLE ARE WEARING IT NOW?
Oh, THANK JUNO. POSCA.
what IN HEAVEN'S NAME IS
Posca: JOCASTA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WAS ONLY-- - QUIET, WOMAN!
POSCA, WHERE'S ANTONY?
Yes, YES! A GREAT PLEASURE.
INDEEDS. COME ALONG.
POSCA?
POSCA?
thank YOU.
they've ALL GONE INSANE.
it's FOR THE BEST, YOU KNOW.
this PALACE LIFE IS NO GOOD FOR YOU.
you NEED ACTION.
Yeah.
you'll BE MUCH MORE HAPPY WHEN THE WAR BEGINS.
Vorenus. - SIR.
I HAVE A DELICATE MISSION FOR YOU.
Oh, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU HAVEN'T GONE NATIVE, AT LEAST.
perhaps YOU CAN TALK SOME SENSE.
what IS THE MATTER WITH THESE PEOPLE?
why HASN'T ANTONY BEEN TOLD OF OUR ARRIVAL?
I've BEEN ORDERED BY TRIUMVIR MARK ANTONY
to ESCORT YOU BOTH BACK TO YOUR SHIP, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU LEAVE ALEXANDRIA AS SOON AS THE WIND ALLOWS.
without SEEING HIM?
he TURNS AWAY THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD?
that's CORRECT.
it WAS SHE WHO ORDERED YOU TO DO THIS, WASN'T IT?
Antony WOULDN'T ACT SO LOW.
I TAKE ORDERS ONLY FROM MARK ANTONY, MADAM.
no, WE'RE NOT GOING.
mother, I-- - MADAM?
we ARE NOT GOING.
I AM NOT MOVING FROM THIS SPOT
unless ANTONY COMES DOWN HIMSELF AND TELLS ME TO GO.
if YOU WILL NOT GO WLINGLY, I HAVE BEEN GIVEN ORDERS TO USE WHATEVER FORCE NECESSARY TO REMOVE YOU.
you WOULD MANHANDLE THE WOMEN OF THE JULII?
no, BUT THESE MEN HERE...
they HAVE NO SUCH SCRUPLES.
Antony! - MADAM.
come DOWN, YOU BASTARD!
madam, PLEASE!
you TELL MY HUSBAND THAT HE'S COWARDLY SCUM.
tell HIM THAT.
you REALIZE, OF COURSE, WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE ALL OUR MONEY BEHIND.
I DON'T CARE! - WE'RE PENNILESS.
I'm SCARED. I WANT TO GO HOME.
please, HURRY.
going SOMEWHERE? - NO.
no, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?
please, VORENUS.
don't TELL. PLEASE DON'T TELL.
have MERCY ON US.
they'll KILL US.
they'll THROW US TO THE CROCODILES.
my WIFE IS OVERWROUGHT.
we WERE MERELY GOING TO TAKE A STROLL ALONG THE HARBOR TO LOOK AT THE SHIPS.
then YOU MUST HURRY.
the WIND IS CHANGING. THE SHIPS LOOK BEST WHEN THE SAILS ARE SET.
come WITH US.
no.
war IS SURE TO COME NOW.
this IS NO PLACE FOR DECENT ROMANS.
true, BUT I HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.
now IS THE TIME.
if YOU HAPPEN TO SEE TITUS PULLO,
ask HIM TO KISS MY CHILDREN FOR ME.
I WILL DO THAT.
thank YOU.
Hello, AGAIN.
Posca: SORRY TO TROUBLE YOU.
would YOU MIND AWFULLY IF WE HIDE HERE
until THIS BOAT IS AT SEA?
I've TOLD YOU EVERYTHING I REMEMBER.
there MUST BE MORE THAN THAT.
look TO YOURSELF.
you ARE WHAT REMAINS OF HIM.
Vorenus.
well?
they're GONE.
good.
good.
and HOW IS... ATIA?
I SUPPOSE SHE TOOK IT WITH HER USUAL POISE?
no.
no?
had TO BE DONE.
Where's POSCA?
I SENT FOR HIM BUT HE DID NOT COME.
I DON'T KNOW, SIR. DO YOU WISH ME TO GO AND LOOK FOR HIM?
Oh, NO NO.
it's ALL RIGHT.
I'm SURE HE'LL TURN UP.
sir, YOUR WIFE INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
she INSTRUCTED ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE COWARDLY SCUM.
she DID, DID SHE?
Oh. AND
and WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THAT?
it's NOT MY PLACE TO HAVE AN OPINION, SIR.
Nah. TELL ME ANYWAY.
is THAT AN ORDER?
Yes. THAT AN ORDER.
you're NO COWARD.
but YOU DO HAVE A STRONG DISEASE IN YOUR SOUL.
a DISEASE THAT WILL EAT AWAY AT YOU...
until YOU DIE.
Really?
and WHAT IS THIS DISEASE?
I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT A DOCTOR.
no.
no, YOU'RE NOT.
so HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE OF YOUR DIAGNOSIS, THEN?
I RECOGNIZE YOUR SYMPTOMS.
I HAVE THE SAME SICKNESS.
long ONE.
Hello, MOTHER. AND POSCA.
what A PLEASANT SURPRISE.
I GATHER ANTONY WAS NOT AMENABLE TO PERSUASION.
no, HE WAS NOT.
but YOU KNEW THAT, DIDN'T YOU?
you WANTED A VILLA IN CAPRI.
now YOU MAY HAVE ONE.
is OCTAVIA WELL?
Posca HAS SOMETHING HERE THAT WILL HELP YOU DESTROY ANTONY.
mother, I AM HOPING-- - CRUSH ANTONY AND HIS QUEEN.
and YOU CAN KEEP YOUR DAMN VILLA.
you HAVE SOMETHING FOR ME, POSCA?
it IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT
of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.
to BE OPENED AND READ ONLY ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR DEATH.
it IS A DESPICABLE DOCUMENT.
taken TOGETHER WITH HIS REPUDIATION OF YOUR SISTER, THE ROMAN PEOPLE WOULD THINK A WAR AGAINST ANTONY
not ONLY INEVITABLE
but EMINENTLY DESIRABLE.
is IT GENUINE? - IT IS GENUINE.
you ARE A GOOD AND LOYAL FRIEND, POSCA.
this ONE HAS COOKED HIMSELF FOR DINNER.
he ASKS TO BE BURIED IN ALEXANDRIA.
he DECLARES CLEOPATRA HIS WIFE AND THAT THEY ARE LIVING GS.
she IS ISIS AND HE, OSIRIS.
it's PERFECT. - WAIT, WAIT. IT'S BETTER.
he LEAVES TO HIS CHILDREN BY CLEOPATRA ALL THE EASTERN PROVINCES.
and HER SON BY CAESAR
is TO BE GIVEN ROME AND THE WEST.
having REJECTED HIS LOVING WIFE, OCTAVIA, MARK ANTONY HAS COUPLED HIMSELF TO THE SORCERESS
Cleopatra, PROMISING HER DOMINION OF ALL ROME!
he WORSHIPS DOGS AND REPTILES.
he BLACKENS HIS EYES WITH SOOT LIKE A PROSTITUTE.
he DANCES AND PLAYS THE CYMBALS IN VILE NILOTIC RITES.
I KNOW HOW UNHAPPY YOU ARE AND I CANNOT BLAME YOU.
for WHO WOULD NOT WEEP WHEN HE HEARS THAT THE GREAT MARK ANTONY PAYS HOMAGE TO FOREIGN GODS?
that HE HAS ABANDONED HIS WIFE,
his CHILD AND HIS COUNTRY?
I AM ASKED IF HE IS GONE MAD, IF HE IS BEWITCHED.
I HAVE NO EXPLANATION.
we MAY WEEP FOR HIM, BUT THEN WE MUST DO OUR DUTY, FOR HE IS NO LONGER A ROMAN, BUT AN EGYPTIAN.
and WHAT IS LEFT FOR US TO DO BUT FIGHT HIM?
fight HIM AND DESTROY HIM!
Pullo.
my OLD FRIEND, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
sir.
come, SIT DOWN.
Posca TELLS ME OUR FRIEND VORENUS
stands BY ANTONY EVEN NOW.
loyal MAN, VORENUS.
he SENDS YOU HIS BEST REGARDS, ASKED THAT YOUISS HIS CHILDREN FOR HIM.
he's ALL RIGHT, IS HE? - YOU KNOW HIM.
iron AS EVER.
- YOU AND HE ARE STILL FRIENDS, THEN?
Yes.
very SOON I WILL HAVE TO GO EAST TO END THIS THING WITH ANTONY.
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.
Why? - YOU ARE CLOSE TO VORENUS.
he IS CLOSE TO ANTONY. IT MAY BE YOU CAN ACT AS A MEDIATOR.
and MAYBE WE CAN SAVE UNNECESSARY BLOODSHED.
not TO ARGUE WITH YOU, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY.
there ARE SOME WILL HAVE TO DIE, OF COURSE. ANTONY CANNOT BE SAVED.
the BOY CAESARIO WILL HAVE TO GO, OBVIOUSLY. - CAESARION?
they HAVE NAMED HIM PUTATIVE KING OF ROME, PULLO.
he WILL HAVE TO DIE. BUT PERHAPS CLEOPATRA AND HER CHILDREN BY ANTONY MAY BE SAVED.
preserve SOME STABILITY. - YES.
I SEE.
I DO NOT WANT TO ORDER YOU TO CO, PULLO, BUT I WILL IF I HAVE TO.
no.
no PROBLEM.
I'll COME.
good.
it WILL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.
an ADVENTURE TOGETHER.
so, ANTONY MORE OR LESS FORCED OCTAVIAN INTO WAR.
else THE EAST WOULD BE LOST TO THE GYPOS.
we WOULDN'T WANT THAT, NOW WOULD WE?
worshipping A BUNCH OF DOGS AND CATS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.
ANYROAD, THE THING IS, OCTAVIAN'S ORDERED ME TO GO ALONG WITH HIM.
so THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE DOING-- GOING ALONG WITH HIM.
can I COME WITH YOU? - NO. SORRY.
you STAY HERE WITH ME, HMM? WE'LL BE FINE.
you'll HARDLY NOTICE I'M GONE.
and THE GOOD NEWS IS, I'M MORE THAN LIKELY TO SEE YOUR FATHER.
he SENT WORD THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU ALL A KISS FROM HIM.
if I SEE HIM, CAN I GIVE HIM A KISS FROM YOU IN RETURN?
no. HE KILLED OUR MOTHER.
it's TRUE, ISN'T IT?
you're A HARD ONE, YOU.
my FATHER MADE ME SO.
I HEAR YOU.
while I'M AWAY, THERE'LL BE NO TROUBLE BETWEEN YOU.
no SKIMMING FROM THE GRAIN RATION, NO STEALING OF WOMEN, NOR ANY EXTORTION, ROBBERY, OR ARSON
unless UNDER DIRECT LICENSE BY MASCIUS.
anybody STEPS OUT OF LINE, THEY'LL BE SHARING THEIR DINNER WITH MEMMIO.
don't FORGET YOUR VINEGAR FLASK.
mm, RIGHT.
give US A SMILE, EH? WON'T BE GONE FOREVER.
if YOU REALLY LOVED ME, YOU'D TAKE ME WITH YOU.
it's A WAR, NOT A SHOPPING TRIP.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
I KNOW YOU CAN. WHICH IS WHY I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT LEAVING YOU HERE.
where ARE YOU GOING NOW?
vinegar.
memmio?
this IS NOT HAPPENING. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
what HAVE I DONE?
why ARE YOU PUNISHING ME LIKE THIS?
Oh, YOU SELFISH BASTARD. IT'S ME WHO'S DYING, NOT YOU WHO'S BEING PUNISHED.
it's ME.
I'm GONNA DIE.
it IS AS-- AS IT SHOULD BE.
what HAVE YOU EVER DONE?
you're A GOOD WOMAN.
Oh, DON'T GET SENTIMENTAL ON ME NOW.
one THING I'M NOT IS A GOOD WOMAN.
you've BEEN GOOD TO ME.
no, I HAVEN'T.
EIRENE WAS A GOOD WOMAN.
not A SHE-WOLF LIKE ME.
she HAD HER MOMENTS.
she WAS GONNA GIVE YOU A CHILD.
fate HAD A DIFFERENT PLAN.
we're HAPPY ENOUGH, YOU AND ME.
I'm SORRY.
I CAN'T GO TO THE AFTERLIFE WITH LIES IN MY HEART.
nemesis WON'T LET ME REST.
what LIES?
what's NEMESIS WANT WITH YOU?
send THESE PEOPLE AWAY.
get OUT.
remember WHEN I'M GONE, WHAT I DID,
I DID OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU.
did WHAT?
it WAS ME...
who KILLED EIRENE AND YOUR CHILD.
I WANTED YOU FOR MYSELF.
so I POISONED HER.
goodbye, LOVE.
welcome to www. 1000fr. com
didn't come out here to play games!
bus is leaving in 5 minutes.
get your gear or it stays.
you're out here 6 days, boys.
had a chance to prove yourselves.
and what have you done?
showed me you're a bunch of lazy sons of bitches.
I got your message.
good. What do you think?
it presents as mass suicide.
can you prove it?
not without visiting the campus.
that's what I thought.
I can't make an assessment without meeting the faculty and students.
I know.
it-- the school is up for the federal Tomlinson grant.
this does not bode well.
the director's a graduate of Somerville Academy, isn't he?
Yes. And he's been fighting for the government funding.
these boys killed themselves for a reason.
no one should write that off.
I'm not asking you to.
Somerville Military Academy, Oceanside, Florida, 5 boys were found hanging this morning.
the bodies are at the medical examiner's now.
there's no photos?
school personnel thought they may still be alive, so they cut them out of the trees.
so we're walking into a contaminated crime scene.
we don't have anything solid?
"we're sorry" was carved in a tree branch nearby.
this happened on campus?
no, in the woods about an hour away.
how long were they out there? - 6 days.
without supervision?
it was an outward bound mission for the upperclassmen.
what drove them to suicide?
a freshman cadet, Bailey Shelton, hung himself 2 weeks ago in his room.
identical bed sheet, hangman's knot.
who takes sheets camping?
they would if it was the plan.
could be domino effect.
the campus would have been on high alert after the first one, so the kids wait until they're alone in the woods.
they must have made some kind of pact.
and there's something else. 6 kids went on the trip.
only 5 were found.
the school officials confirm that Josh Redding is still missing.
so maybe he chickened out of the pact.
or was never a part of it.
and the campus is completely off the grid.
no Internet.
I can help with that.
which is why you're coming with us.
and so am I.
isn't Somerville the director's alma mater?
Yes.
the academy has enjoyed a spotless reputation, so the hope is to keep the investigation in house.
I imagine there's a lot of concern for Josh.
he's been in those woods almost a week.
so how's he surviving?
"things do not change. We change." Henry David Thoreau.
there's still no sign of Josh Redding.
we'll join the search.
so, the Somerville Academy was founded during World War II.
it is hard-core old school.
they don't even have a website.
socioeconomic breakdown's all over the map.
Yeah, so are the ages.
students are 12 to 18 years old, on the same campus, in the same dorms.
same personnel has worked there for a lifetime.
Ron Massey has been superintendent for 30 years.
he's an alum, as is the majority of the staff there.
lieutenant Tawes has been his second in command this whole time.
these type of places have their own infrastructure.
if it ain't broken, they ain't gonna fix it.
that's probably why they banned modern technology.
they didn't need it back then, they don't need it now.
aggressive motto-- "vivere est vincere."
to live is to conquer.
the school raises soldiers.
suicide is not part of that mantra.
Bailey Shelton was only 13 years old.
he was one of the youngest students there.
his death is probably the key to the others.
Colonel Massey, Erin Strauss.
this is the team I spoke with you about.
agent Hotchner.
this is Agent Morgan, Agent Jareau, Dr. Spencer Reid, and Penelope Garcia.
so shouldn't the flag be at half-mast?
I haven't told the boys yet.
do they know who we are?
I'll tell them when the time is right.
I've called all of the parents.
they're driving from up and down the East Coast.
in fact, Josh Redding's have just arrived.
I'd like to speak with them.
they're in the chapel. - How are they?
as you'd expect.
all right, I'll get started.
cadet.
any leads on Josh?
in that terrain, he's only capable of moving a mile an hour.
puts him in a 60-mile radius.
that's 3, 600 square miles to cover.
Tawes knows those woods better than anybody.
we've got two agents meeting and we'll start the investigation here.
Where's the place with the most outlets?
best bet is in the library.
thank you.
we'd like to start with Bailey Shelton's suicide.
do you have a copy of the medical examiner's report?
I don't. But there was no question he hung himself.
well, the nuances can tell us a lot.
the doctor's receiving the last of the bodies now.
I expect he's got his hands full.
I'll speak to him later.
of course.
it would be helpful to us to know what Bailey's last day was like.
I'll show you.
he stayed in the plebes hall.
his father took all of his belongings after the suicide.
Josh's items are as they were.
Josh stayed with the first years?
he's the brigade commander.
Bailey's suicide hit him hard.
were all the victims friends of Bailey's?
brotherhood is the very price and condition of man's survival.
Carlos Romulo.
all of my boys are brothers.
there's Tucker Calhoun's parents.
excuse me.
if the boys were so vulnerable, why did they send them into the woods?
because it was time for their survival test.
we have a docket.
it's been only two weeks since the initial suicide.
you couldn't postpone this trip?
classes were canceled the day after Bailey died.
but men are lost in battle all the time.
this isn't battle, and these aren't men.
they are when they leave here.
how many suicides have you seen?
just these.
so part of the mission was unsupervised?
for a week.
but you came back 6 days later.
standard procedure to check in if the weather's extreme.
had lightning and thunder last night.
the boys didn't have any way to communicate with you?
smoke signal.
Seriously?
basic survival skills, ma'am.
we teach them to follow their instincts, not rely on technology.
no radio, no weapons.
well, survival courses like these often trigger a fight or flight response.
it looks like that's what happened to Josh.
who slept here?
don't know. They're all identical.
whoever was here took off.
and it's secluded.
did Josh Redding isolate himself a lot?
I suppose.
he was a loner.
and why is that?
he didn't want to be at Somerville in the first place.
why did you send Josh here?
because he was getting into a lot of trouble.
and he was always angry and...
he was being a teenager.
you were gone, Will.
all the time.
he was nearly 6 feet tall by the time he was 14.
with a bad temper, and he was punching holes in walls, and he wouldn't listen to me anymore.
he could be belligerent.
but this-- this was extreme.
Why?
we had to force him.
what are you doing? Let me go!
we're helping you, Josh.
mom, dad, please, don't let them do this!
they're not gonna hurt you.
dad, please!
I was afraid he was gonna hurt himself.
or someone else if we didn't get him some help.
how was Josh taking Bailey's suicide?
we only talked once after that.
phone calls are a privilege here. Was that difficult for Josh?
Josh has never been much of a talker, but I think he felt a real responsibility for Bailey and the other boys in the hall.
did he ever tell you why Bailey may have killed himself?
no.
Mr. Redding.
how are you gonna get my boy back here?
these beds are all 3 feet apart and there's absolutely no privacy.
how did Bailey hang himself without anybody noticing?
apparently he did it in here.
he used Josh's room?
according to Massey, Josh offered Bailey a lot of support.
he told you that?
Yes, when we spoke.
is that a problem?
is there anything else he mentioned?
the boys come in here just to sleep. It's why it's so minimal.
Strauss, what, are you on the board or something?
I just saw the campus same as you.
it's hardly a prison.
these kids are told what to wear, what to say, and when to eat.
this goes against the very nature of these boys.
they're all looking for some type of control in their lives, and this place strips them of that.
and suicide is the ultimate power?
isn't it?
well, at least the boys felt enough remorse to write "we're sorry.
that doesn't trump taking your own life.
what is it?
but I guess I can buy that the other kids couldn't hear Bailey hang himself.
Josh was laying right here.
I've never seen a mass suicide apology.
maybe they knew it would help their parents.
could be confessing other sins.
who was in this tree?
good cadet.
looks like Josh has doubled back a few times.
but the dogs can't find him.
is he familiar with these woods?
all first years come here for a mission.
Josh tried to run away back then but didn't get far.
none of them do.
but after 3 more years of training...
he didn't weigh himself down with supplies.
smart.
we taught him well.
Colonel, it's been 6 days since the suicides.
why hasn't Josh come back to campus?
he's got trust issues.
I thought he was doing well.
too smart for his own good.
the most dangerous kind.
dangerous to whom? - Himself.
boys like Josh reject the lessons of men.
his generation has little respect for their elders.
does that include you?
we've been working on it.
all the first years start in the laundry room.
it teaches them responsibility.
Ten-hut!
Bailey finished his rotation and walked back to his bunk.
so he was still here for bed check?
it wasn't the first time.
was he punished for being late?
if you're suggesting that Bailey killed himself because of a talking to, that's absurd.
that could depend on what you said.
he understood I was disappointed.
were the victims' bunks made before they went into the woods?
each and every morning.
so where did they get the sheets to hang themselves?
carry on.
come on, baby. Come on.
Boo!
jeez, you scared me. I thought you were a ghost.
you know, older buildings like this emit a low enough frequency that you can't consciously hear.
because the sensory overload can't be explained, it wreaks havoc with your emotions, inducing fear, panic, and dread, hence the feeling of being haunted.
what about the visions?
your eyes overcompensate for what your ears are missing.
that said, I do know a 3-year-old boy that once met a friendly apparition named Leverett Saltonstall.
he was nice? - Very nice.
you'd think the laundry room would be closer to the dorms.
it's not in the basement?
it's on the opposite side of campus. That's so strange.
Yeah.
leaves of 3, let them be.
Oh, man. - Poison Ivy.
alcohol swabs, stat.
thank you.
you know, if I've got it, so do you.
I'm Italian. It knows better.
Where's Massey?
he's meeting with the victims' families. They're arriving now.
JJ, how are Josh's parents?
upset. They sent him here to keep him away from trouble.
Tawes made it seem like these guys are the only family they have.
you make it sound like a cult.
uh, it kind of is.
this is a well-respected institution.
they're not on trial.
the integral part of the investigation is going to be understanding what these victims lived every day.
and with who.
Bailey Shelton killed himself in Josh Redding's room.
was Josh in the room that night?
according to the records.
I will dig for dirt.
Dave, you find anything in the woods?
Josh's tent was secluded. His things were left behind.
he just took off.
Massey said he never got any respect from Josh.
and Josh's own parents said he was impossible to control.
his course load indicates increased isolation.
isolated, smart, angry.
that could be a budding psychopath.
what are you saying?
Josh Redding killed his classmates?
then he's not missing.
he's on the run.
and he was been for a week.
one hell of a head start.
with all the skills he could ever need.
Present...Arms!
Order...Arms!
Colonel, any sign of Josh?
Tawes was out there all night.
the volunteers have spread out to the next county.
where do you think he'd go?
to higher ground.
but we would have seen him by now.
sir, you said it was Josh who found Bailey hanging in his room, correct?
when he woke up, yes.
you didn't find it to be odd that Josh could sleep through that?
what are you saying?
Josh is the only person in common with all these deaths.
you think Josh killed Bailey?
it's a possibility.
I sent a murderer into the woods.
whoever did this wanted us to find them just like Bailey Shelton.
OK, so how did he do it?
how did Josh control 5 strong kids?
Josh supervised the cadets both in the bunk and the laundry room.
that could explain how the sheets got out.
Yeah, so what does "we're sorry" mean if it wasn't written for suicide?
what if Josh wanted them to apologize for something?
for their sins?
there's no record of bad behavior, but all of these guys were Alpha males.
the were all upperclassmen who might have bullied Bailey.
the message was carved under Tucker Calhoun's tree for a reason.
Yeah. We need to know more about that kid.
what are you looking at? - The M. E.'s report.
bilateral fracture of the pars interarticular of the C2 vertebra.
what's that?
classic hangman's fracture, but only one of the 5 victims had it.
which one? - Tucker Calhoun.
Garcia: Jeez, who is this guy?
the others suffered rotational fractures, hanging was secondary.
staging the crime scene.
Josh is more sophisticated than we thought.
and vindictive.
he wanted Tucker to suffer.
the question is why.
Tawes thinks he's on a rescue mission.
he still is.
we've got an enemy out there.
someone who killed 6 of my boys.
we need to figure out why.
we need to start with everyone who knows Josh.
...March!
no, ma'am, Josh didn't have friends.
why is that?
it depends on who you ask, sir.
what was his relationship with Tucker Calhoun?
Josh is straight up.
this place never broke him.
no matter how hard they tried.
who tried to break him? Tucker?
a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.
you've got an honor code.
my guess is not everyone lives by it.
you do.
ma'am. Sir.
right face!
forward march!
they all gonna be like that?
not all of them.
"we shall defend our island," "whatever the cost may be," "we shall fight on the beaches," "we shall fight on the landing grounds," "we shall fight in the fields and in the streets," "we shall fight in the hills," "we shall never surrender."
we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
why the hell would Josh hurt them?
has Josh been more distant this year?
well, his course load is extreme.
did he specifically complain about anyone to you?
I already told you no.
you said he was frustrated being saddled with the younger cadets?
that boy Bailey cried himself to sleep every damn night.
maybe Josh had had enough of that.
he met him outside.
Bailey's father couldn't come into this building.
so Josh folded is clothes, his towels, everything, all so that his dad wouldn't have to walk past this room.
that's what my son did.
that's who my son is.
is it true Josh killed them all?
do you think he did?
I wouldn't fool with Josh.
you're a smart kid. He's a big guy.
you ever see him fight?
all the time.
what about Josh and Tucker Calhoun?
did they ever get into it?
Tucker was an ass.
he used to come in here and pee on the sheets after we washed them.
did he do that on the night that Bailey Shelton committed suicide?
the bastard did it every night.
do you think Josh wanted to punish those kids for picking on Bailey?
sure. But he wasn't supposed to be on that trip, anyway.
what do you mean?
it's a leadership reward.
you gotta have at least 20 points to go.
but Josh only had 16.
points?
they're posted. More points, more rewards.
how many do you have?
negative 5.
good luck.
thanks for the help.
no one told us about a point system.
so Tucker Calhoun has the most points.
who approves them? - Massey.
well, maybe Tucker was his little pet.
leader of everything.
that comes with an attitude.
steamroller types like that, they don't let anybody get in their way.
nothing was nice about that kid.
it sounds like he strong-armed everybody.
well, then the points are for bad behavior, only they're not calling it that.
we should look at the points of everyone who died in those woods.
my guess is they were all bullies.
except for Josh.
Hotch, is something going on with Strauss?
Why?
well, she's awfully protective of this place.
she's got pressure from above.
you sure it's nothing else?
she doesn't like the field.
really. Any word from Josh?
no.
Colonel, we need to speak to Bailey Shelton's parents.
well, his mother died years ago.
I could get hold of his father.
do that, please.
what's going on?
Josh had contact with Bailey's father the day he died.
and you think he could give you behavioral clues about Josh?
it's all we have right now, Strauss.
the man just lost his son.
do you really think he's going to remember how Josh acted?
by all means, I'm open to other suggestions.
Massey knows his students better than anyone. Why not trust him?
because all Massey wants right now is for this to go away.
he'll tell us whatever he thinks we want to hear.
Oh, yeah.
what the hell was he doing way out here?
it isn't exactly the kind of place he'd stumble upon.
do you think Josh built this trap?
right out of the Somerville handbook.
he even used his poncho to cover it.
he lured Chris Shelton here.
the body was still warm. Probably died just a few hours ago.
so Josh couldn't be far away.
Tawes already took off. Thinks he can find him.
a little help?
so why would Josh want Bailey's father dead?
the duffel's from Somerville.
it's got Bailey's stuff in it-- and these.
bed sheets.
he's the one who hung those boys.
OK, so he blamed them for bullying his son, and Josh escaped.
Josh wasn't supposed to be out here in the first place.
this trap was to protect himself.
but this place isn't on any map.
how did Bailey's dad find it?
somebody tipped him off.
I make a promise to watch after these boys.
in many ways they're my own.
then something like this happens.
Colonel, so you're saying Josh was in his room the night that Bailey hung himself?
what is it with you people? I've already told Agent Morgan.
was Josh in his room?
Yes.
23 cadets sleep in that building. They're saying he wasn't there.
they're lying.
but that's against your code.
they haven't been here long enough to understand the importance of it.
did Josh find Bailey in the laundry room after that check?
Bailey was his responsibility.
and who else was there?
no one.
are we finished?
Tucker Calhoun liked to pick on Bailey. Was he there?
no.
Josh didn't have enough points to go on the trip.
why did you send him?
he needed the challenge.
tell me this-- did Josh kill Chris Shelton in the woods?
he was being chased, in which case it was self-defense.
Josh killed a man.
any advice on how to tell his parents?
Prentiss said Mr. Shelton had a cell phone.
I'm gonna need to see that.
doesn't the school have a cell phone?
goes against their policy, remember?
so is playing favorites.
you know, a man like Massey sets rules but is the first to break them.
he's been left alone to run these kids' lives and nobody questions him.
Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that.
his policies are a combination of many other philosophies.
I'm not sure where his actual leadership lies.
only that it does...Lie, that is.
it's a joke.
good joke. - Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
the school does have a cell phone. Only it's not listed under Massey.
the account was opened...
by Tawes.
if Massey's lying about something as simple as a cell phone, what else is he hiding?
I met Chris Shelton when he claimed his son's body.
this is the last thing I expected.
multiple points of entry from the spears.
he still wears his wedding ring.
Bailey was all he had left.
he'd do anything to protect him.
I'm not sure about that.
Bailey's trachea showed signs of scarring.
he'd attempted suicide before?
no. It was internal damage.
he had stress to his heart and lungs that isn't typical in someone his age.
it's not in your report.
it wasn't related to the C. O.D.
how old are the injuries?
it's hard to say.
then you assume his father was abusive?
someone was.
I didn't think much of it till I saw similar scars on the other boys.
including blisters and burns on their hands.
on all of them?
their scars were much older, but yes.
identical.
sir, may I?
when did you decide where the boys would be camping?
the day Tawes dropped them off.
no one else knew?
no need.
you didn't write it down anywhere?
we don't use maps of that terrain.
you're expected to know it.
Mr. Shelton must have been quite upset when you saw him.
of course he was.
who did he blame?
what?
for his son's suicide. Who did he blame?
I have no idea.
well, the guilt must have manifested itself elsewhere.
was it you?
excuse me?
he was a desperate widower who put his son in your hands.
he trusted you, and look what happened.
ma'am... - What?
we're trying to help him and he's keeping things from us.
I have cooperated fully.
did you blame someone?
Josh Redding?
Tucker Calhoun?
this is ridiculous. - Oh, for God sakes, Colonel!
he didn't just find that campsite all by himself.
it's time you leave.
I'm sorry. I just don't have the patience for this.
he's clearly hiding something.
all due respect, ma'am, have you been drinking?
what?
what are you talking about?
Strauss, we have one shot at this.
you think I don't know that?
well, if he smelled what I can smell on your breath right now, the credibility of this investigation would be compromised.
the organ damage is severe, like the boys have been suffocated, but what about the blisters?
the youngest cadets probably have the freshest scars.
all right, well, we're gonna need one of them to admit it.
Hotch, she's drinking.
Strauss? - Yeah.
she needs help, man.
she could blow this case.
what happened?
she laid into Massey.
she actually said the kind of things I would have said.
and for a minute I was like, ok, good.
she's finally on our side.
but then I smelled it, Hotch.
I asked you if something was going on.
you partnered me with her.
Morgan, she was getting help.
I'm gonna have to call E. A.P.
but this is not-- What? This is not about me?
is that what you were gonna say?
you know how many times I've heard that, Hotch? Well, I am tired of it.
you keep telling me that I have problems trusting people.
well, from where I'm standing, you're the one who can't trust anyone with anything.
any sign of Josh?
Tawes is still looking.
I need to find students who are having trouble with authority.
OK, I can do that.
but I gotta tell you, they post rewards faster than they do demerits.
all right, well, look for kids who had disciplinary issues before they came here.
OK. I got a few.
all right, did any of them have class with Bailey Shelton?
no, but each of the plebes have laundry duty. Does that help?
their dorm is the farthest point from the laundry room.
why are they so isolated?
the M. E. said Bailey had blisters and burns, fingertips were raw, his trachea had internal scarring.
that's awful.
guys, that could be damage done inside an industrial-size dryer.
Oh, my God.
that's how Massey's breaking these boys.
Hey, Bailey.
Tucker. Tucker, don't, please.
please, Tucker.
please. Please, Tucker.
please! Please! Stop it! Please stop it!
I can't breathe!
please! - Let him out!
go, Bailey, run!
no. In all the materials it says they don't believe in corporal punishment.
Bailey writes about each of those boys and how they bullied him.
his father must have read it and wants revenge.
does it mention Josh? - Not at all.
they why would Chris Shelton go after him?
what if Massey lied to Chris Shelton?
and set Josh up.
and he convinced Shelton that Josh was responsible for Bailey's suicide.
that still doesn't explain how he found the secluded woods.
wait, where's Mr. Shelton's phone?
it's right here.
it's got a couple of contacts on it, Somerville Academy being one of them.
any unknowns? Tawes has a cell.
no way. Lieutenant no tech?
there's one unknown. It's a text.
it looks like, uh, phone numbers.
what are they?
and 802-8448.
those aren't phone numbers. That's latitude and longitude.
right where those boys were camping.
Massey's withheld information at every step along the way.
he's not to be trusted. - What's your theory?
he's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment in which children like Bailey Shelton and others are repeatedly abused.
Josh is a protector type.
his power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.
we believe that's when everything shifted.
Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.
there's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.
Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.
why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?
he wouldn't. He had another agenda.
Massey texted Chris Shelton the coordinates for the campsite, not to hurt all the boys, but to take out Josh.
but he didn't count on Josh fighting back.
and he underestimated the power of Chris Shelton's revenge.
staging the murders to look exactly like Bailey's death was a message.
to who?
to Massey.
Chris Shelton wanted Massey to lose his sons, too.
Josh knows Massey has secrets, and he's the only person who can bring the school down.
and now Massey will do anything to destroy Josh.
sir.
have you found him yet?
negative, sir.
you finish this. Understand?
Yes, sir.
we need to find Josh before Tawes does.
Tawes has a massive head start.
Josh is close and has a plan.
how would he escape?
get to higher ground.
what's the fastest way out?
he'd look for wheels. How did Chris Shelton get there?
he probably drove his own car. We didn't see any ATVs.
Chris Shelton drives a truck.
did you see one on the road on the way in?
no. - Where's the next closest road?
well, it's a trek. It's at least a few miles north of where the body was just found.
that leaves 3 likely areas where he would have parked.
you didn't find any keys, did you?
because Josh probably took them.
all right, we need to divide up.
I've waited 3 years for this.
you little bitch.
Tawes, don't do it.
it's over.
Yes, Mrs. Jarvis. I understand your concerns, but we're all fine.
soldiers, ma'am.
call anytime.
Colonel Ron Massey, you're under arrest.
I've done nothing.
you texted Chris Shelton the coordinates of the campsite.
that makes you an accessory to murder.
texted?
OK, fine.
you had Tawes do it.
why would I do that?
because you had no power or control over Josh, and you couldn't handle that.
the problem is, he wasn't gonna go away quietly.
he wanted you to pay for all those years of abuse.
no one will believe Josh.
he's a troubled boy.
he's a grown man, Colonel.
you should be proud.
beware, so long as you live, of judging men by their outward appearance.
Jean de La Fontaine.
you got a minute?
Yeah.
do you have the after-action report?
no.
I need it on my desk by the morning.
I'll give it to the director.
pardon?
it's time for you to admit that you need some help.
I don't take orders from you, Aaron.
you put my team in jeopardy.
is that what you told him, Agent Morgan?
you compromised the integrity of the unit. - I did no such thing.
open the drawer, ma'am.
this is absurd.
Aaron. Aaron, what are you doing?
one call to the E. A.P. and everything will be all right.
in what world will this be all right?
you have no idea what this is going to do to me.
agent Morgan will make sure that you get checked in privately.
and for that you should be grateful.
I'll wait outside.
it's a party, not a funeral.
uh, it was my mom'S.
God, you can be such a bitch sometimes.
Eppes.
all right, all right, all right, I'm on my way.
did you recognize any of them, miss simms?
it all happened so fast, I didn't even see them.
what about before? Did you see anyone hanging around, watching ella?
everyone. I mean, she's ella.
right. Thanks very much.
straight-up grab?
Yeah, with flash grenades and automatic weapons, and they were professional enough not to hurt anyone.
well, a lot of witnesses.
and not a good one in the bunch.
it's not any ordinary club kid. It's ella pierce.
what, that rich kid? The party girl?
someone's been trolling internet fan sites.
her father is warren pierce. He's worth, like,$2 billion.
he's got textile factories in every country in the world without a minimum wage.
he been notified?
I talked to him on his plane en route to aspen. He's on his way back.
how you doing? Jeff upchurch.
Hi, there. -Critical incident response.
don eppes.
I was on my way to guadalajara, and they rerouted me.
I'm guessing I was the nearest specialist in the area, so. .
specialist in what?
you guys do, what, ten, 15 kidnappings a year?
mexico city, I do 15 a month.
work kidnappings europe, asia, afghanistan.
it's always different, always the same.
so, what's different about this one?
I don't know yet.
but the big money snatches tend to put you in contact with a higher class of lowlife.
if they know their business, and I'm certainly guessing they do, we're looking at simultaneous movement, expected payouts, bargaining strategies. Lot of variables here.
you guys talking about imperfect information games?
checking in. .
you must be professor eppes. -Hi.
bureau gave me a copy of the action report from the che lobo kidnapping last year.
got to tell you, I'm very impressed with the maze math.
Thanks. -Could use some similar inspiration here.
sounds like you might have already started. You were just talking about game theory?
I was. Assuming that our kidnappers are experienced, or they have benefited from the experience of other kidnappers, we can use an optimization method here called a tabu search, which is basically a way of excluding bad data.
places where the kidnappers won't go to isolate where they will go.
I guess that's why they call it tabu, right?
these kidnappers-- they're like a group of hikers.
but they've mapped out a very specific route.
that route is complicated by the terrain, by the density of foliage, by dangerous animals, by water barriers.
they deal with these obstacles using their experience, using the accuracy of their maps, their needs.
and a tabu search can pinpoint the optimal route that the hikers can then choose.
now, assuming that opps' goal is the safe collection of a ransom,
I can interpret their methodology; I can predict their actions.
okay. How soon?
not a lot of information here, you know?
my projections are going to be fairly general.
but as always, the more data that comes in, the more helpful I can be.
Yeah. Eppes.
key's still in the ignition.
I got something.
check this out.
play ME
warren pierce is a criminal, a ruthless parasite who lives off the backs of the workers he exploits.
his debt to society has come due, and if he doesn't pay it. .
the people's nationalist agenda will take it in the blood of his daughter.
we'll contact Mr. Pierce with our demands at noon today.
Kgagenda, aka the pna.
anti-corporate, anti-free trade.
Anti-warren pierce.
the guy who runs the web site-- he calls himself santee, but the bureau's counterterrorism unit-- they don't have a face to go with that name.
they don't even think it's one person.
thing is, we don't even have any identifiable members.
I mean, the banners go up at antiglobalization protests, somebody spray-paints "pna" at a vandalized construction site, but there doesn't seem to be any real, centralized organization.
all right, so maybe they're just messing with us, you know? Maybe they're just hiding behind these guys.
okay, so the van used in the abduction was registered to a diamond lane rentals, reported stolen last week.
start with anyone who'd know the girl's schedule, right?
that's got to be half of los angeles.
Yeah, the good-looking half.
these celebrity socialites-- they live electronically, so,
I'll go deep on the e-mails, text messages, phone logs, the works.
Yeah, good.
so what happened last night?
I don't know. You know, it was late, and I took the call. I thought I'd let you sleep.
that's it?
that's all you're going to give me?
that's all there is.
look, don, we both know things haven't been clicking since leah was killed.
I think you just wanted me out of your face for a few hours, right?
I don't know. Look, even if that's true, is it that big a deal?
it's something to talk about, yeah.
well, I mean, I'm in the middle of a kidnapping here. Come on.
all right. You know, I'll just wait for a bank robbery.
ever since ella became a media darling, a power partier,
I've been waiting for something like this to happen.
and you never saw to it that she got any security?
she turned down bodyguards.
said any kidnapper would pay to give her back after two days.
and with the joke, you let the issue drop?
that's not at all what I meant.
anything ella ever asked for, ever needed, I've always given her gladly.
what you need to understand, mr. Pierce, is that ransom is enough business to make a fellow like yourself confused.
Meaning?
kidnappers will position. They will establish bargaining power.
gentleman such as yourself that's used to calling the shots, used to winning.
you're asking me to be humble.
I'm asking you to be smart.
okay, this is what we talked about. Want to stay calm, engaged.
keep them on the phone as long as possible. Is everybody ready?
whenever you are, sir.
hello.
if this isn't warren pierce, ella pierce is as good as dead.
who are you?
don't ask who I am. Ask how much I want.
I need to know my daughter is all right.
dad? Daddy?
demand 1: Shut down all of your company's sweatshops operating in the third world.
if it's me you want.
demand 2: $40 million in rtititueson paid to the thousands of men, women and children your company has exploited in the third world.
I'll give you $10 million.
in a secured swiss account.
this guy's using a sat phone. He's bouncing the signal.
what the hell was that?
a counteroffer.
you're lowballing on your daughter's life?
I talked to him in a language he understands.
do you understand that they hung up on you?
that you put your daughter's life in more danger?
he'll call back.
and now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to make arrangements for payment.
guys like that-- it's all about money and power.
actually, that was the right call, straight out of the playbook.
he pays too much, too fast, too soon, pna's going to figure they didn't ask enough.
they're going to come back looking for more.
you really think he could be operating out of your playbook?
you got a different theory?
that his daughter's just another negotiable asset.
you get this out of your favorite head shop?
no, charles. This cannot be purchased in any shop.
I've constructed my own hero's fountain.
named after hero of alexandria, the greek mathematician and engineer.
you see, once the pressure is right, the water will flow under its own power.
and how is this part of your achieving zen, larry?
einstein said religion should arise from the experience of all things natural and spiritual in a meaningful unity.
now, made from the parcels of my former self, this fountain perfectly analogizes the seamless integration of both my physical and spiritual lives.
shouldn't you be at the fbi? The kidnapping is all over the news.
Oh. Yeah. The ransom negotiation cut short, so I may need to rethink my tabu search.
maybe weight the data with a bayesian prior.
while I condone none of the major felonies, do have to say, kidnapping-- that does hold a certain.
conceptual intrigue, this business of affixing value to a human life.
Oh, I think it's almost there.
observe, charles: Water rising to a new level, as is my own hope.
I'm out of here.
it dawned on me while I was looking at larry's zen rock garden.
what? Larry has a zen rock garden?
Yeah, actually, it was his hero fountain that got me going, but it's an even longer story.
let's reconsider my hiker analogy, all right?
and think of a mudslide falling in front of the hikers.
it changes terrain, it changes their direction.
right, okay.
so my tabu search accounted for the kidnappers following a planned path, but with pierce's counteroffer, they've had to break off contact.
they've essentially been detoured.
they have to find a new way to get to their waterfall.
we're expecting them to make another ransom-oriented decision, to hike around the mudslide, right?
but I-I think they're going to abandon that path completely.
I think they're going to find another way.
everyone down on the ground!
open the safe.
so what do you think, kill the pierce girl and go underground?
Oh, that would be giving up.
essentially turning around.
I based my analysis on the information the pna put up on their web site:
their stated goals, their state of mind.
I think they're going to going to bulldoze through this mudslide.
I think they're going going to do something sudden, something violent, something completely unexpteecd.
all right, so the safe holds cash deliveries from payroll trucks and they drop off two to $300, 000 a day.
but these geniuses hit two hours after the money went to the bank.
so they got six, maybe seven grand in petty cash.
not the hit they were hoping for.
their movements are really synchronized;
it suggests a high degree of discipline, a high degree of conviction.
let's not dance around it. What are we thinking here?
judging by the way she's balancing that rifle, my money says it isn't even loaded.
that girl could be holding a gun behind her back.
I mean, look at this face.
that is the face of a scared little girl.
so they lose the ransom, they hit pierce's business, but I don't get why drag the girl along?
puts her in the line of fire.
human shield, maybe it's their counteroffer to pierce.
they placed her in deliberate frame of that security camera.
they want us to see her face. They're asserting dominance.
I think they just want to eolatvi pierce and show him that they control his destiny.
that looks like an alpha to me.
think he's our mythical santee?
Warner.
what?
Pierce just e-mailed the pna's web site and told them he isn't paying.
I've dealt with rogue governments, guerilla fighters, organized crime.
they all understand the rules of negotiation.
if these animals aren't going to speak to me in a language I can understand. .
well, that's why I'm here, sir. To help translate.
look, we both know that if I cave in, they're going to bleed me dry.
and I still won't get ella back.
that's always possible.
so what was my choice?
well, you had a couple of options, sir, the worst of which was negotiate with the pna without talking to me first.
so you think I should back down?
tell them I'll pay.
no, you change your direction too quick, it's just going to confuse them.
we definitely don't want these guys panicking.
the next move is theirs.
let's just hope it's not killing your daughter.
you don't have much of a bedside manner.
must be why I don't get invited to many parties.
still trying to break into ella pierce's e-mail account. It turns out it's encrypted.
it's locked with a software tool used primarily by it programmers at major corporations.
that's funny, huh? I mean, why would she be doing that?
if you don't, that stuff will turn up on some online celebrity gossip site.
you know the whole world knows your business.
let me ask you something. I mean, not about this.
about liz?
Yeah, how'd you know?
you asked permission to ask.
Hey, I got to end it.
I mean, it's just way too complicated with work.
the thing is, every time I do, we end up in bed.
Hey, man, you guys work funky hours, long stakeouts, you're dodging bullets together.
it sounds like adrenaline.
I mean, adrenaline is great, but, you know, I don't know if that's a real relationship.
I'm sorry, you wanted to ask me a question.
I think you just answered it.
so what kind of lizard decides that his daughter isn't worth a fraction of his bank account?
loathe as I am to contradict you, the decision is so entirely out of character.
it suggests true emotional anguish.
Larry, what the hell would you know about his character?
I think what he's simply pointing out is that pierce has violated his own corporate game theory.
it's standard minimax.
it's a tug of war, a demonstration of brute strength between two opposing sides where one side can pull the other side across a center line.
however, after the competition started, one team can embarrass the other by letting go of the rope.
that team humiliates its opponent, but they've lost.
so essentially, pierce has let go of his rope.
he's struck back in the way least likely to achieve a positive result.
which runs counter to the instincts responsible for his corporate success, ergo my observation that his judgment is clouded by a high state of distress.
Yeah, but, larry, I went through ella's things, and I found letters from her father, throughout her childhood that were typed.
they were dictated to a secretary.
I know, because his secretary's name is cc'd on them.
what kind of father would do that?
so you two just stick to the blackboard and I'll take care of the profiling.
I expect that from my brother.
any idea what's going on there?
Yeah, some.
so pna put this up ten minutes ago.
the people's nationalist agenda is not to be taken lightly.
their recent action towards my father's corrupt business interests are just a taste of what's to come until he responds to the pna's demands.
close the sweatshops.
pay the ransom.
sent directly to the national news outlets as well.
it'll be all over tv tonight.
so what, he piss on them, they piss on him?
all right, meanwhile, we've made some headway on your alpha.
he's looking more and more like our "santee.
facial recognition software connected him to several antiglobalization protests and then a gun store robbery in seattle, two months ago.
similar mo.
all the same characters.
my guess is that this is where they decided to graduate from tree hugging and disorderly conduct to heavy felonies.
the problem is that santee managed to keep his nose clean, at least on paper.
there's no rap sheet, no id.
20s, wanted, off the grid.
listen, um. .
I know this isn't the right time to talk.
but I just want to make sure we make the time.
I think so, too. I mean, uh. .
we will.
okay.
it's an mpeg file, and from its resolution, I think it came from a sat phone.
Ayok, how does that help us?
I mean, if we had a dtmf decoder. .
it's a dual-tone multi-frequency. It's touchtone.
you couldn't have just said that to begin with?
Yeah, but it wouldn't have been as much fun.
the decoder works kind of like a prism.
instead of refracting light into its individual frequencies, its component colors, the decoder separates the phone signal into different tones and numeric values.
from which we can then decipher the actual phone number.
okay, where can we get one of these things?
if the kidnappers are using a land line or a cell phone, you can buy a dtmf decoder from a consumer electronics store.
right, but they're using a sat phone, so. .
hacking a satellite signal requires a little more sophistication, but I can put a unit together.
I mean, I built my first computer when I was 13.
I know my way around a circuit board.
and, you know, the electrical engineering department has all the parts I need.
all right, so if they're using a satellite phone, this thing is going to tell us where they were, not where they are now, right?
Yeah, that's why I've been patiently waiting here.
I think the additional information has helped my tabu search, and I think I have an idea where the pna might show up next.
as far as hunches go, I certainly played worse.
they appear where he works, so his neighborhood could be next.
when it comes from charlie, it's kind of a hunch-plus.
so I've heard.
also heard some stuff about you.
Yeah, like what?
you like to run with the tactical boys.
the first through the door, that sort of thing.
cowboy enough to get your name out there, but not unsafe.
I just had a few things on my mind, man.
kicking in doors and dodging bullets?
that's my kind of therapy.
I came up through special forces.
nearly bounced off the walls in that damn field office.
you ever consider going for the adrenaline fix full-time?
you get to travel, leave the paperwork to guys like. .
well, you.
man: Reportsif a olent alarm at 7626 east ellendale.
Ellendale, that's two blocks from here.
it's also harper simms' address. That's ella pierce's friend.
FBI! Nobody moves!
let me see your hands!
you in the car! Up! Let me see them hands!
back off!
it's never gonna happen.
what the hell just happened here?
looks like our rescue mission just turned into a manhunt.
l us what you saw.
they were waving guns around.
I thoughtI was going to die.
and ella?
was showing them where everything was:
the cash, my mom's jewelry, the safe.
she was acting like the brat that she is, except with a gun.
and that loser steffen, calling himself santee now...
you, uh, you recognized santee?
Yes. Steffen cavani-- the stoner we went to high school with.
come on! She's totally with him.
yes and no.
how no?
she's young and she's vulnerable, and she hasn't had any contact with anyone outside of her captors.
what, like, brainwashing?
she would not be the first person to identify with her victimizers and then act accordingly.
she's with them a day and a half.
you have no idea how quickly someone's will can be broken.
Mr. Pierce.
you have my full cooperation. -Thank you.
the sooner ella's apprehended, the sooner my legal team can prepare her defense.
there's no "there must be some kind of mistake," or "my daughter'sno t capable of that?
do you have children? -Do you?
I did some background.
after your wife died, your daughter came into a large inheritance and sued for emancipation.
Ella went through a great deal after her mother's death, and she lashed out at me.
Yeah, and you lashed back with a team full of lawyers and put her back inside her glass jar.
she was a 16-year-old girl, emotionally overwrought, and I was not going to let her ruin her life.
no, you were just going to hold her hostage instead.
it is a small wonder she is identifying with her kidnappers.
it's probably the only love she's ever know.
all right, all right.
how goes the decoder?
who knew tracing a phone call could do so much damage to a manicure?
what?
is it wrong to get turned on at the sight of you in goggles and rubber gloves?
Oh, damn it.
are you all right? -Yeah.
that's the third circuit I've blown today.
I've got a spare in my office. I'll be back.
excuse me, professor.
Oh, hey.
is that a decoder? -Yeah, this is it.
not exactly what I imagined after reading some of your more ethereal musings on cake-cutting theory, I've got to tell you.
well, sometimes cake is a series of algorithms that help formulate an analysis.
and other times, cake is just cake.
listen, I wanted to spitball something at you about that tabu search.
it's funny you mention that because I've been giving it some thought.
it's quite possible that the pna's tactical shift might actually help us.
hitting the house makes no tactical sense whatsoever. -I agree.
it's like your hikers just. .
it's like they decided to chase after a butterfly.
you know what? That's a great analogy.
because once the hikers veer off, chasing after that butterfly, they reveal the butterfly's path with the evidence that they leave in their wake
with footprints and with broken branches.
that evidence allows me to analyze their tactics using decision analysis.
figure out which butterfly they're chasing.
he went to high school with ella pierce and harper simms.
gets expelled from berkeley after a semester for disruptive behavior, then falls straight off the grid.
the techs finally cracked ella pierce's e-mail account.
turns out her and cavani have been going back and forth for nearly a year.
you have to listen to this stuff.
can't believe you're the same guy in moscowitz' history class.
if I'd known the real you, I would've jumped you a long time ago.
lots more where that came from, all in the same vein.
all right, so, what, she hooks up with the loser guy and hides it from harper.
he starts working on her poor little rich girl complex, makes her feel guilty about daddy's sweatshops.
sounds like megan's department.
Yeah, well, megan's on a little bit of a time out, so. .
again?
what about the dead shooter?
Reggie woods, 25.
string of arrests for disorderly conduct, mostly related to antiglobalization rallies in seattle.
Reggie was busted in glendale 2006 for defacing a police car.
his partner in crime was lucas cavani, who purely coincidentally happens to be steffen's cousin.
we've got a call into his parole officer.
delivery van.
you still purging the office?
I'm trying to find suitable homes for the material shards of my past that no longer inform my present.
now, it seemed to me you an affection respighi's ancient airs and dances.
Oh, thank you.
still no respite from the case?
Oh, ella pierce was kicked out of boarding schools from new york to lausanne.
I got duis, stint in rehab.
it's like a textbook example of trying to draw love from her father through negative attention.
unless I'm just seeing too much of myself in the case.
as your friend, I would not presume to speculate, particularly given our last exchange on the matter.
Oh, larry, I'M. .
I'm really sorry about that. I had no right to snap at you.
I mean, maybe you could just not be my friend for a minute and tell me the truth.
you know, I've always been cautious in addressing the issues you have with your father.
well, I know there's profound pain there.
but having said that, it is surprising to me that humanity was able to arrive so quickly at a correct model of the solar system.
there's this driving tendency to orient the universe in rotation around. .
well, our own little world.
thanks for the respighi.
Lucas, fbi! Open up!
Yeah, nice try, frank. I'll have your rent tomorrow.
get up against the wall! I want to see your hands!
against the wall! -I didn't do anything.
Reggie woods is dead.
what?
he made a mistake of pointing a gun in my general direction.
your cousin happened to be standing right next to him.
steffen? -Yeah.
Oh, man, that idiot.
he hasn't been right since he got involved with that bitch.
Yeah, I guess you never get over the one who wouldn't talk to you in high school.
I'm all for fighngti the power, but she talked scary way above my tolerance.
that's why I got some distance.
you can check, whatever you want to check. I don't run with those guys anymore.
Yeah, so where do they run?
Reggie told me they had a squat in east la, near the freeway.
that was a few months ago, though.
while you're out there fighting the power, try recycling.
something larry said got me thinking about a misspent youth.
you and larry warming up again?
I think we're making our way off the back burner.
how are you and don? How's that been going?
trying not to get burned.
it's a challenge.
I think you should get hazard pay for even trying.
speaking of, I got a seduction going on here in these e-mails, only ella seems to be the aggressor.
she flatters santee, she speaks to his political convictions, he mostly agrees with her.
he begs her for sex.
certain words jumped out.
how the hell would he even get near a girl like this?
she's famous, she's insulated by money and privilege, and he barely registers outside of the website.
it's a lot easier for the "it" girl to reach out to the class burnout.
which is also the perfect instrument to lash out at her father.
Oh, god.
Ella must have planned this whole thing.
so I used decision analysis to reset the parameters of my predictive model.
I factored in the impulse motive of the pna.
find our butterfly?
Yeah, my analysis keeps pointing back to warren pierce.
so why did they hit harper simms' house?
it seems to predicate on opportunity and familiarity.
look, they're attacking locations that ella pierce can facilitate.
so what's the next inside job?
I can answer that.
intel says this posted in the last ten minutes.
I have seen the harm and wrong my business practices have caused to the great working peoples of the world.
I call on my board of directors to immediately dismantle my factories, for my bank to dissolve all of my assets immediately.
warren pierce industries has 24 hours to show us their sincerity.
in the great struggle for world justice, my father will no longer receive preferential treatment.
to divest all interests in asia and latin america and donate the proceeds to relief agencies.
as of tomorrow, warren pierce industries will cease to exist.
I don't understand. I thought we had eyes on the guy.
we did, but we pulled them all when this stopped being a kidnapping.
and he has his own security.
well, where were they?
he's buying time. The board will never go along with dissolving his company.
Yeah, but he's out of time.
his refusal to pay the ransom pushed her over the edge.
daddy didny pla'twith her her whole life.
if he doesn't play with her now. .
there's only one way this is going to end up for pierce.
how's it going, guys?
good, good. We're almost there.
we've intercepted the pna's upload of pierce's communique to their website, and she's running it through the decoder.
I isolated the cdma code, and separated the information on the mpeg.
and this is gonna lead us to where the signal was transmitted from, right?
provided we don't blow another circuit.
okay, I got a lock on the phone number. .
north 34 degrees, 38 minutes, west 118 degrees, 14 minutes.
that's east L. A. Cavani said they were squatting near the freeway.
Ah, there it is.
knocking on the door from 300 miles above earth.
we're about to knock a lot harder.
David, talk to me-- you got a visual?
I have pierce.
confirming five bad guys: Three men, two women, including ella pierce.
locked and loaded-- we're in position.
I've got the web cam set up, and I'm hacking into the pna web site.
all right, good.
now, listen, megan, you know, if this girl is in your head. .
she is-- that's why I'm the best person for the job.
any word? -Nothing.
looks like the old man's been lying to us, trying to save his ass.
time's running out, dude.
Ella, we gotta do something. Show him we're not messing around.
maybe if we start sending him back in pieces.
why are you doing this?
it's what pierces do-- taking control of your life, telling you what to do with your money.
we're in.
steffen cavani, this is agent megan reeves from the fbi.
we have the house surrounded.
take the perimeter!
I got nothing to say.
you're gonna have to let piece go.
why, so you can blow us all away?
so maybe you're not going to spend the rest of your life behind bars.
steffen, I know this whole thing wasn't your idea.
I know ella roped you into it.
what are you talking about?
she's the heiress to a multibillion-dollar empire, steffen.
don't you think she could've jtus written a $40-million check to a relief agency?
do you really think she cares about sweatshops?
they paid for her maserati.
she's trying to divide us.
steffen, the only thing she cares about is hurting her father.
you're just the ride to the prom. She's got other plans for the night.
no more talk!
I think I lost them.
Ella, what are you doing?
all right, we fire over their heads, fire over their heads! I want them walking out of here!
Roger that.
David, talk to me.
no target acquisition, don-- they're too dug in.
not all of 'em.
two boys, two girls left.
Ella! They're going to kill you!
who cares?
you already killed me, just like you killed mom.
she didn't die from the cancer, she just didn't want to live in that house any more!
you know that's not true!
your mother wanted to live!
I promised h erI would take care of you!
by trapping me in your world? -Honey, please!
you turned me into a tabloid princess, a punchline on david letterman, all so you could sell some damn clothes!
well, now you're in my headline. -Please!
if this escalates, we scare them into shooting pierce.
all right, let's go-- tear gas 'em, tear gas 'em!
they're not gonna let us out of here!
do not punk out on me now, steffan.
I have had enough of people making promises they won't keep.
let's go, let's go, let's go.
I got two coming out.
come here! Come here.
all right, we got 'em. We got 'em, we got 'em.
the rest of you inside, you have 15 seconds to come out with your hands up in the air.
it's over.
don't do it, steffan!
I'm bringing out pierce! Don't shoot!
you're not leaving me!
I don't see ella.
shots fired! Shots fired!
David. .
no, there's too much smoke.
in the arm?
what kind of cowboy is that?
not a cowboy.
just a field agent.
don't say anything. Don't say anything, honey.
I have the best lawyers!
I love you, too, dad.
so it got pretty hairy out there today, huh?
Yeah, well. .
loquacious, as always.
you want to order some food?
what are we doing? -Tonight?
look, the last few days, we've tried to talk, and, you know, now I just. .
I feel tired.
I think we just keep coming back out of habit. .
you know?
I don't want to feel like we lead each other on.
I mean, you deserve so much more than that and I just keep screwing these things up.
see you tomorrow, boss.
you managed to bring the monastery with you.
it's calming.
well, feel free to find your center here, anytime you wish.
every time I think I'm over my father or my childhood, I. .
I think I let this case take me for a ride.
struggle is not altogether a bad thing.
the charged particles of the solar wind require heat and combustion to escape the gravitational pull of the sun.
from tumult comes freedom.
you have this great way of making my neuroses sound cosmic.
my center is back east, so I'm gonna go visit my dad.
I already booked the airplane ticket, it's nonrefundable. .
you want to come with me?
Oh, really?
are you serious?
I don't know, it just sort of came out.
I guess not.
this is very odd, because for some time now, my wanderlust has stoked in me this deep inner urge to visit new york.
I would have to talk to brother theo.
while he's in deep meditation, I've been made custodian of his rabbit.
lucky rabbit.
pay some fucking attention this time.
your life's not simple, Fiona, and you're nothing like anyone I've ever met.
you make me want to enjoy my life again.
who the hell is that? -- My dad.
in my whole career, I've never seen such a spectacular display - of alcoholism.
thank you.
how much are we short? -- $18. 30.
I'm taking the PSATs for some Polish kid.
are you able to kick in, like, ten more? -- I get paid Friday.
okay, I'll figure out the rest.
I can loan you the money.
we don't need your charity.
Fiona, thanks for a night I'll never forget.
who the fuck's Tony?
I've waited a long time for last night to happen.
at least Tony's not coming here getting all in my family's business.
what the fuck is wrong, Frank?!
maybe that's what I want.
you know nothing about me. -- Then teach me!
I'm gay. -- I know.
that's for screwing my husband.
I want another baby. -- What?
I get what I want, and you can have what you want.
put the candy back, now.
fuck! -- Shit!
I like you, Fiona. You're a dirty girl, like me.
jasmine, this is Veronica. V lives next door.
Hiya, V.
we're only taking in a foster kid for a week to get the money to pay for my stupid parking tickets.
want to go over to the park, throw the ol' pigskin around?
would it be all right if my son Jonah came?
I scored you a 2, 200.
I'm an investigator for the Educational Evaluation Service.
this is the robotics lab. It is the best in the country. Come by anytime.
science just turns me on.
what are you hiding?
I left them.
your house is Frank's wet dream. Never gonna get him out.
dad. -- Son.
what are we? -- Friends.
just friends? -- Friends who like to do this.
I knew that.
it says here you can re-dedicate yourself as a virgin.
oral sex, orgy, big black strap-on dildo.
you whore!
he humiliated me!
get out!
don't ever come back!
you're out of the house.
I'm out of the house!
what do you think now, daddy? Am I still a whore?
I think I was kind of falling in love with her.
how long you been stealing cars? -- Who says I steal them?
I have to leave town. Come with me. Costa Rica, it's beautiful.
I think I might be in love with him.
scary, isn't it?
I love you. -- I want to be with you. Come with me.
won't be long now, Frank.
in a few days, she's gonna make it to the store, then the hair salon, "Alibi Room."
gonna meet your friends.
ninety-nine...
hear all those heart-warming, scumbag freeloading Frank stories.
who the hell is that? -- Friend from group.
group? -- Sex Addicts Anonymous.
gig's almost up, Daddy Frank. Time to make other plans.
one hundred!
Hey, cut it off, Ernie.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
Hey, do you mind if we drop Cami off early tomorrow?
Teresa's got inventory at Costco.
no problem.
and tell Teresa thanks for the case of dented soup.
Bye-bye, Cami.
pool's open!
Eddie goes to the corner for a pack of Lucky's, never heard from again.
goddamn City couldn't wait to stop paying him.
wasn't two weeks before the checks stopped coming.
and now what are we supposed to live off of?
Sheila's single disability check?
how does Mr. Osama Obama expect us to survive on that?
he gonna try and tase me. I hit him.
if Sheila does go to work, what's she going to make?
minimum wage... at best.
nobody's heard from Eddie? -- Not a word.
man's got no sense of responsibility.
leaving a family of three to fend for ourselves.
I got tased twice, man. -- Bullshit.
what you say?
I said bullshit!
I got tasered for like a second, I crapped myself.
there's no way you got tasered twice, fought off three cops ran away.
you calling me a liar?
at the very least, an exaggerator.
a grand says I did.
Kev, you still got that taser back there?
I'll see your grand and add nine more.
10, 000 in American legal tender says you can not get tasered twice and not soil your tighty whities, much less keep standing.
all right, shithead.
move.
do it.
do it!
again!
what?
Where's my ten grand, motherfucker?
Hey, gorgeous, more Diablos.
Oh, you think these Boy Scouts can handle that kind of heat, girls? -- No.
no, not a chance.
six more Diablos, a JB back, Ketel One up with a lime wedge, Maker's seven, and four Stellas.
haven't given up on that one yet? Every summer needs a challenge.
man's in love with his own fabulous self.
probably masturbates while he licks his reflection in the mirror.
who's that, Slutty's husband? -- Uh, no. Hal's rounder.
Hi. -- Hi.
Fi, this is my friend, David.
jasmine's told me a lot about you.
only that you're fabulous, smart, and unbelievably sexy.
and that you're home for the summer from Princeton.
I'll get us a table. -- Okay.
Princeton?
we're going out later. You want to come?
what about Hal? -- Annual Michigan fishing trip with the softball buddies.
mosquitos, bratwurst and gallons of Budweiser.
sounds pretty Brokeback to me.
come later, live a little.
that a regular thing? -- First time I've seen him.
she probably did his taxes, then did him.
kick him back, you're punching like a fag.
first round. Go to your corners.
you know you're supposed to hit him back, right?
fuck, that kid hits hard.
what did you think this was going to be?
I didn't think he could punch me with a foot.
you see that? He kicked me in the top of my goddam head.
listen, look at me. You want to throw in the towel?
round two -- I would if I was smart.
he's crazy about you.
long Island, two Landsharks, three Mojitos, Margarita no salt, Chivas neat and a Jack rocks.
all the woman needs is a pole.
why don't you come out with us later.
Kev won't mind. -- I can't. I got a shift at the nursing home in the morning.
this better be somebody who's about to give me a gigantic tip.
God, I'm so sorry. I thought your ass was my drink.
Hey, Justin Bieber.
how's things at Goldman Sachs?
going well enough for me to afford getting ripped off coming here.
and it's JP Morgan.
Oh, whatever. All you mortgage-raping shits should be in prison anyway.
Yeah, well, I was in grad school during the mortgage crisis.
nowadays, we're trying to short euros so Greece will go bankrupt.
are we on for later? -- I haven't decided if I still like you.
later, Mama Bear.
Hey, Junior, school night. In bed with the lights out by 10: 00.
what? -- Order's up.
how the hell did that little guy kick Kurt-fucking-Landis' ass?
we make anything on my fight?
Thanks, Rasmik!
Nah, nobody wanted the odds.
What'd you put down? -- On the fight you lost?
nada.
fraternal loyalty doesn't extend to stupidity, bud.
so, Mickey's out soon, yeah?
in about a week or so if he doesn't stab anybody else.
plastic fork...
barely broke the kid's skin, but it bought him another 30 days.
you got to be looking forward to having Mickey home again, huh? -- I guess.
Hey, I want to stage another fight night next week.
go around to the dojos, round up some more scrappers, all right? -- Sure.
where you going? -- Karen's.
thought you gave up on that. -- See ya.
Karen Jackson? After that thing with your dad?
I'm sneaking antibiotics into his toothpaste, just in case.
tomorrow fuckhead!
Jesus Christ!
fuck!
friend dropped me off. -- Right.
what the hell you doing here? -- Came to see Karen.
she went with a guy to her group.
what group? -- Sex Addicts Anonymous.
well, can I come in and wait? -- No.
looks like old man Dave is beating your time, Romeo.
Yeah, well, I'm working without pharmaceutical assistance.
he was popping little blue pills... I counted four.
four, wow. We could be here awhile.
Ah, fuck!
I told my boss I'd meet him for a run in about an hour.
I could run with you. I ran track in high school.
what? Don't look so surprised. I ran distance.
there was a chance I was gonna make state.
yeah? What happened?
life. Come on.
I'm fast. -- Oh, really?
I could beat your ass. -- You're on.
wait!
okay, ready? -- Give it to you.
okay. -- All right.
on your mark... -- Yeah.
get set... -- Okay.
go!
what are you doing? Are you a valet now?
see you tonight?
maybe. -- Maybe?
Hey, Fiona.
how's work? -- It's good.
how's your remodel coming?
you really want to know or just being neighborly? -- Neighborly.
cast iron plumbing's out, replacing it with copper.
guy on my shift moonlights as an electrician, so he's going to help me rewire.
you gonna flip it or live in it?
waiting to see what happens.
I got to get the kids going.
what happened to you?
one of my fighters pussied-out on me, I had to fill in.
looks like the pussy had the right idea. Get some ice on that eye.
good morning.
we're out of mac and cheese.
I can make PB&Js instead, but I'm gonna need more bread.
how many signed up for today? -- Nine.
Romano twins, Cami, Mangis, that Ulin kid with the big head.
whoa, half a cup. I'm exhausted.
Liam had me up half the night banging his head.
I need my own room.
and I want a pony for Christmas.
he's a boy, he should be in with the boys.
no way, there's three of us in that room.
I'm a girl. I'm going to be a woman soon.
I need privacy to undergo the upcoming traumatic transformation.
it's not that traumatic.
how would you know? -- Video in fifth grade.
what are we talking about? -- Moving Liam into our room.
no fucking way.
first day care kid is here.
my own room? -- It's not gonna happen, Debs. Go, go.
"Traumatic transformation"?
Ethel, the garden looks great.
it's all in the compost.
my red worms have been working overtime this year.
none of God's bounty ever needs go to waste.
still on for today?
think it still runs?
probably not, but you can fix anything.
Hey, what are those huge round green things in the back? -- Tomatoes.
she's a keeper.
Frank! Karen! Breakfast!
I moved it.
Hey! Good morning.
I, uh, I can't find my watch.
I have looked everywhere.
it's on your wrist.
I had mom move her rainy day fund after what happened last time.
Karen, the omelets are ready! -- I had nothing to do with that.
Hello?
I hid her ATM card, too, so don't even try taking that again.
her nose has been running, but I think it's just the glue that Jeff's been using on the new kitchen linoleum.
Bye, baby.
Oh, and please, no gluten.
gluten? -- Who knows.
Hey, there you go. There's Cinderella.
uh, you all set? -- Yeah.
playtime, one hour. TV or Bambi...
skip the dead mom part.
arts and crafts. Cheetos and carrot sticks.
story time, nothing scary. Free play, lunch, nap, pool, Dr. Oz, Twinkies and milk, parent pickup.
Oh, and don't wake you unless there's blood or exposed bone.
lots of blood.
who's ready for TV, guys?
okay, let's watch.
it's about time.
you see Kash last night? -- No.
he didn't come home again.
had to open the shop by myself.
homeless winos ten deep at the door trying to trade stolen recycling for 40s and Mad Dog.
uh, pack of Marlboros.
how old are you, eight? Get the hell out of here.
you handle the store by yourself? I got to get upstairs.
the twins are going to be late for swim team at the mosque.
and no free breakfast. You come to work hungry, you pay like everybody else.
Linda gone?
been waiting across the street for an hour.
late night?
what do you care?
where the hell have you been?
Kash! I waited up until after midnight. You know the doctor wants me in bed by...
what are you looking at?
go microwave me a burrito and stock the cooler.
a pack of Marlboros?
what?
Hey, you try starting this thing since last summer? -- No.
Hey, how's the crop coming?
it's almost harvest time.
but I'm a bit worried though.
it seems like there's a lot more cops in the park this summer.
Yeah, I'm working on it.
I'll go chase the rats out of the coolers.
Hey, guys.
what are you doing? -- Borrowing Liam.
Where's that, that backpack thingy?
borrowing him for what?
going to take him to the aquarium.
no, you're not, it costs too much.
okay, then, the zoo.
when are you bringing him back?
I'll bring him back when I'm damn ready.
I'm his father, we need time together.
should we wake Fiona?
see any exposed bone?
Stan's yelling again, so loud you can hear him through the floor.
Oh, yesterday it was Nixon and Jimmy Carter. What's it today?
I turned the TV up after "fucking colored people."
he keeps going downhill like this, you're going to have to call Becky.
he has his good and bad days. -- Bad days?
that's what you call trying to take out the trash naked?
he forgot his pants... it happens, all right?
I know you love the old racist bastard, but if it were my dad, I'd want to know he was going south.
it's probably time for her to think about putting him in a home.
I can't hear you.
no.
n-no, I don't want to watch my language.
I've been speaking this language for the last 50 goddamn years.
no, you listen to me, you fucking daughter of a chink whore.
Hello?
goddamn cunt, cunt, cunt.
she hung up on me.
the bitch didn't speak one word of English.
she's probably in the basement of some whorehouse in Calcutta.
a-and would you believe this shit?
what shit? -- My electric bill.
$8, 700 bucks for electricity.
you know, I've been running this bar for 40 years and I never got a bill that was even close to a grand.
all I want is for them to send me one of their taco-eating, wetback meter readers to come here and check out the fucking thing!
Nah, that's it, get me my shotgun.
I'm going to go down there and blow the cunt's head off.
can I see it... the bill? -- Yeah, here.
they must have made some mistake.
the only mistake they made was fucking with me.
all right, Stan, would you please sit down?
Stan, sit down before you blow - another ventricle.
Yeah, blow, blow.
I'm gonna take care of this, all right?
arizona's got the right idea, boy...
take 'em down to the border and throw 'em over the goddamn fence!
that's it.
LAN, cover the register.
we have a problem. We may need to sell some pot.
isn't that what we always do? -- A lot of pot.
so Ethel's been helping us out.
you know how she told you about that kick-ass worm shit she's been using - on her tomatoes? -- Yeah.
well, it worked so good, we decided to use it on this year's crop.
you know how I usually grow a couple plants to get us through the summer?
holy shit. -- Exactly.
wait, so what's the problem?
forgot about the electric bill.
we need nine grand or they're gonna shut the power off to the building.
isn't it wonderful?
Mr. Kevin is going to help all the old people who are going blind.
God bless you.
Jesus loves you.
fuck you, Frank.
Jesus... oh, shit. -- Where's my money?
okay, okay, okay, stop!
back to work.
your fly is down.
so how much do you think you've got growing down here?
I don't know, a couple hundred pounds or so.
I'm gonna start drying what I can, but that won't fetch more than a couple grand or so by Friday.
well, you know what? Maybe we could, uh, unload some of the plants?
Yeah, how much would we have to sell?
five maybe, six?
lip, who the hell around here has two grand for a plant?
I might know a guy. - V's going to kill me.
she's going to fucking kill me.
I promised her that I wouldn't sell more than three or four this year.
normally I throw a bunch of seeds around, see which looks best, thin out the rest, but this year I couldn't.
they're all so beautiful, I just... I just couldn't do it.
Where's my fucking money?
that was great last night.
you were having fun, I was having fun.
Where's my fucking money?
you were serious about that?
get me the goddamn tin snips.

Oh, with who, David Petraeus?

Micro-robotics surveillance drone prototypes. -- Yeah?
Yeah, well, who knows if it'll work, but it'll put some government-issued pork in my pocket.

I could probably wrangle you some AP engineering or physics credits.
Ah, no, thanks.

Yeah, I came by last night, waited around for a while.
well, I didn't get in till 4: 00 a. m.
new guy? -- Jody.
he's nice.
I don't know. We got to talking about music yesterday, and he showed me a bunch of bands I've never heard of.
my favorite was called Guns N' Roses.
guns N' Roses? How old is Jody?
uh, 37, I think.
you know, he laid out a blanket in the park, and we listened to his iPod, and fell asleep in each others' arms.
sex any good? -- No sex.
it's a part of this whole Sex Addicts Anonymous thing.
right, but you're a teenager. I mean, all teenagers are sex addicts.
Yeah, but I've been having sex since I was 11.
I don't know. Jody and I don't want the physical to complicate things for us.
Yeah, but we can still get, uh, complicated, right?
sure, I guess.
Oh, shit.
uh, foot patrol, nine o'clock. 200 yards and closing.

Thanks, Debs.

little Charlie had a major diaper malfunction.
Ellie ate a bunch of carpet.
normal, normal.
Oh, and, uh, Frank took Liam.

how's it going? -- Go away, Frank.
is Mr. Todd here today?
I said, out! -- I'm in trouble.
you're always in trouble. -- Come on, Hugo.
you know me. I wouldn't be here unless I was desperate.
it's my kid. I need money.
which kid? --Liam.
the mulatto? -- Yes.
no bullshit this time? -- No bullshit.
Hey, Frank? Hold on. You got more takers.
wait.
Liam and Frank aren't at Sheila's.
knock, knock.
Hey, Debs. -- Hi, Jasmine.
want me to start calling around?
no, I'll swing by The Alibi before work, see what he's up to.
what who's up to? -- Frank took Liam.
probably has him out panhandling again.
david has a friend coming into town from New York.
I thought maybe I could hook you two up.
who's David? -- Uh, bye, Debbie.
a friend? -- Yeah.
I met him. Forties, handsome. He's your type, too.
Oh, yeah. What's my type?
cute and easily manipulated.
you take money from David?
you mean, am I turning tricks? -- No.
he takes me out, he buys me nice things sometimes.
that's what rich people like to do.
they like to spend their money.
rich guys like a pretty girl on their arm, so, why not let them spoil us?
done at 5: 00. Cool if I split?
Kash, I'm off. Can I go?
you okay?
I can't do this anymore. Live this lie.
Linda, our marriage.
this life of a lie.
what am I going to do?
Frank wasn't at The Alibi? -- No, and Sheila hasn't seen him.
he won't keep Liam long.
a toddler will interfere with getting hammered and passing out in the park before 11: 00.
how was last night with Jasmine and Grandpa?
I guess they've been together for years.
he's married, she's married.
seems like it works out for everybody.
yeah? You think it works out for his wife and her husband?
Hey, like clockwork. How serious are you about this one?
not very. -- Good.
cause he's a rebound. He even looks like Steve.
no, he doesn't...
I got my running shoes in the car, and I want a rematch.
rematch? -- Yeah, we raced on the beach last night.
Hey, wasn't that bad.
she annihilated me. It wasn't a fair fight, though. -- She was a track star.
you ran track? -- Distance runner. 1600. Broke some kind of state record.
no shit.
what record did you break?
I didn't break it.
I mean, coach thought I might be able to.
what was the record?
the time that you were gonna break? -- It wasn't a big deal.
come on, what was the time?
coach thought I might be able to break five minutes, 25.
who knows? Long time ago.
I bet that you could break it now.
you know what? We'll find a track, and we'll get a stopwatch.
sure.
yeah? -- I've got a table.
got the truck running? -- Yup.
we are back in the ice cream business.
how was work? -- Weird. Don't ask.
Hey, don't jerk off in there!
what the hell is this?
fuck, Lip.
it's an admissions packet.
Oh, West Point?
going through my stuff now?
Ian, you just graduated the tenth grade.
wanted to see what it would to take to get in.
what, to West Point? You're kidding me. You're actually serious about this shit?
well, I was in ROTC for two years, so, what did you think, Lip?
I don't know. I thought it was some kind of stupid, fucked-up adolescent phase.
I mean, you really want to get your ass shot off in some Stan somewhere?
"Stan"?
Yeah, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraqistan.
I guess I'm a patriot.
fuck.
don't worry. It was really discouraging.
I'd need, like, a 4. 2 GPA, a massive SAT score, and a recommendation from the President or some shit.
only thing I know I can pass for sure is the fitness test.
Oh, so, what, the army requires straight A's now to get your leg blown off in Kabul?
you really want this shit? -- Yes.
all right, then, fuck it. Let's make this shit happen.
yeah? -- Hell, yeah. President's a local boy, I can tutor you.
you're a shoo-in.
I still think it's fucking stupid.
fuck are you...
uh, get off... Get out of here. You better run.
what the fuck?
I know. Baby, I know. I got carried away.
but now what? What do you want to do?
you can't sell it. We got to get rid of it.
this isn't, got pulled over with a half joint in an ashtray pot.
this is Mexican cartel, 60 years in the federal slammer pot.
wait, wait. What are you talking about? Destroy it?
Kevin, there's a couple of tons of weed down here, and I'm black.
well, what about other electric bill?
we'll figure something out, dip into our savings, but this?
this shit's got to be mulch by tomorrow.
To-fucking-morrow.
Frank? Frank, where have you been?
I've been worried sick. You didn't come home for dinner.
I have done everything I can think of, and I still didn't make enough money today.
well, I, I have $80 in my purse.
no, that's, that's not...
well, sure.
I think I might have really screwed up this time.
it's been crazy exciting to see these cubs following their mom like this.
the Marsh Pride nursery has been so cool to watch this week.
these cubs are five weeks old now and ready to rock off to a new den.
Debbie? -- No Liam.
Frank didn't bring him back?
where the hell is he?
Where's Liam?
where is Liam?
he's at his first sleepover.
he's two!
they sleep a lot at that age.
which way?
this one?
who the fuck are you?
we want Liam back.
Liam stays. He's collateral.
then you better start shooting.
Hey, good to see you. -- Man, shut the fuck up.
how much is that?
I don't know, but we're good for it.
Gallaghers pay their debts.
now, where the hell is our brother?
okay, home sweet home.
good night, buddy, love you. -- Love you, bud.
I'm sorry, Fiona.
it's not your fault. Get some sleep, okay?
I didn't mean for that to... It was a joke, you know?
I was in the bar, I made this stupid...
I tried to make enough that I...
Ian. -- Oh, yeah.
yo, Freddie, what you got today, aluminum or plastic?
Ian, tell Kash to get his ass up here. Now, Ian.
don't worry about it.
Hey, Kash, Linda's looking for you.
can you do me a favor, Ian?
can you give me a bit of a head start?
you're leaving?
Linda's got preeclampsia.
the OB wants her in bed for the rest of her pregnancy.
I can't do it.
an hour, two, please.
what do I tell your kids?
been to bed yet?
you're not going to believe the night I had.
kids up yet?
think I may need some field hands.
we handed over all the cash that we'd made so far this summer and we still owe him, like, six grand.
that's the money that we count on to get us through the winter.
well, what was it, some kind of bet?
Oh, ten grand, you believe that?
now we'll be lucky if we can bank enough to get us to Christmas.
Yeah, hey, V, can we at least save some for the ice cream truck, you know, keep it stocked all summer?
how much is that? -- One bag should do it.
all right, but less than an ounce on the truck at one time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
sure, take a bag. It's the least we can do to thank you for your hard work.
Carl, stop pushing. And don't bite.
hold it... Babe, you got it?
all right.
all right, that it?
so they don't fall.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
peace.
thank you.
Bye, Veronica. -- Bye, baby, I'll see you later, okay?
all right, so now what?
to the dump, I guess.
seems like such a waste. -- You got any better ideas?
you looking for Karen? -- Yeah, I am.
she went to the store.
you Lip?
Jody.
nice shirt.
should about do it.
shit.
well, good afternoon, sleepyhead.
Where's breakfast?
Oh, it's way too late for breakfast.
you even missed lunch.
I'm not a short-order cook, sweetie.
so... I'm off for my walk.
108 steps today is the goal.
I might even make it to the mailbox.
there's Lucky Charms in the pantry and milk in the fridge.
okay, bye.
great looking tomatoes.
heirlooms? -- Yes, they are, Cherokee purples.
hope I can talk you out of a couple when they're ripe.
of course. It's all in the compost.
I can give you some worms to get you started.
Really? That'd be great. I was thinking I should start a garden.
you should.
I'll go change, grab a shovel.
Hey, Tony.
five minutes, 23 seconds?
be happy with anything under six.
on your mark, get set.
go!
you look good.
so I had this perp, and I am running my ass off chasing him, which is not what I do, but I'm doing it because this guy, he hurt a kid.
he's scum.
and he actually shoots at me.
he fires on me. I mean, I don't get hit, but now I'm pissed.
so I keep running him down totally against protocol, but there is no way this guy is getting away from me now.
so I catch him, I grab him, I throw him to the ground. He's eing gravel.
I so want to kick his ass, but I hold it in, cuff him, 'cause I'm the good guy.
I'm the white hat.
Oh, white hat--I like that.
wait. There's, uh, there's one more.
you have a second gun...
hidden on your body?
I have a second, hidden gun.
you have a second, hidden gun.
I love you.
okay, her.
no, no, no, no. Her.
what would I say?
you're a doctor. -You're a doctor.
no. She's not right. She's not right.
you're scared? -No, I'm not afraid.
it's just-- I'm just out of practice.
okay, when-- when did you and Naomi get together, college? - Yeah, college.
how'd you pick her up? - Uh, well, she asked me out.
you got no game.
he's got no game. You never had to have game.
Hey, I have game, all right? I have all types of game.
I'm-- I'm handsome. All right?
I just... I'd like to see one of you two try.
I have a woman, but if I didn't, I could do this in my sleep.
okay, her. Right there. That blonde.
come on. Too easy.
not easy. Disturbing.
I thought that she spent her nights with her coven.
Yeah, pick a different woman, one with blood running through her veins.
where are you going?
coop? Cooper? Cooper, where are you going?
leave with me right now.
don't you dare let me out.
leave with me right now, please.
I'll do the thing with my tongue... twice.
I've gotta go. I'll call you later.
are you serious?
this banging has to stop.
fourth-floor construction got you down you know, people actually don't like to have their therapy in the midst of incessant banging.
I thought you were gonna call the construction company.
I did, and they referred me to the leasing company, who in turn referred me to the attorney.
apparently they havea legal right to carry out construction during business hours.
who is they? -Violet...
we rented the floor, they are a corporation, they need to remodel.
morning.
no, I don't want to-- what? Go ahead.
I'm not gonnaif we're not...
we are. Yeah, we are. We are.
he's perfect. He's a good guy.
he's sweet and funny and very pretty and-- and the problem is what?
he said it.
Oh, god. He said it? So fast?
I'm freaKing out. Why am I freaked out?
well, because you have trust issues. -I don't have trust issues.
you cheated on Derek. Derek cheated on you.
how could you not have trust issues?
this is not about that.
it's about what Kevin said. He said...
what is wrong with him that he would say it so soon?
maybe he actually does-- no, no, no. don't y it.
trust issues.
we've got some news.
big news.
Cooper and I took Sam to a bar last night.
since when do you go to bars? -I go to bars...
if I want. -News...
Cooper went home with Charlotte King.
tiny blonde hurricane Charlotte King? - the one and only.
C-C-C-Cooper slept with Charlotte King.
Oh, Violet, come on. I know you're mad at meabout the construction, but come on--Cooper and Charlotte?
Oh, you--you know something.
you do. You know something.
violet turner, what is it?
what, did--did he call you and give youall the juicy details?
did it go badly? Did it not go badly?
did it go well?
are they--are they gonna do it again? Have they done it before?
how many times have they done it before?
Are--oh, my god. They're dating.
morning. -You're dating Charlotte King?
I didn't say a word.
so Pete's been helping you with your holistic birth plan?
Yeah, he's been great.
I want to do everything natural, but Daniel wants to know the sex.
I want a girl. Love boys, but I want a little Laura.
this may bea little bit cold.
sorry. I'll turn this off.
you can take it, honey.
he still working too hard?
Yeah, Daniel's always working.
and he travels a lot, but he's tried to cut down since the baby.
it's not easy. We just bought a house in the valley.
and babies are expensive. -Exactly.
but whenever he's away, he always sends flowers.
roses for meand daisies for the baby.
that's the baby's name--Daisy-- which is why it needs to be a girl.
a boy named Daisy?
Daniel, you're just in time.
here we go.
see, there's a little arm...
and a lile hand.
Oh, my god. that's our baby.
so is it a boyor a girl?
looks like... a little girl.
what's wrong?
there was a subtle abnormality on your baby's ultrasound that may indicatedigeorge syndrome.
it's a genetic disorderthat can...
cause heart defects.
so if our baby has it, one of us gave it to her?
technically, yes, but-- sometimes these things just happen.
we don't always know why.
Danny--now we haven't madea definitive diagnosis, so let's just take it a step at a time and not jump to any conclusions.
let's get you down to the lab.
Franny, please, please take the pills.
Henry, good to see you. It's beeway too long.
I'm sorry I keep canceling my appointments.
it--it gets harderand harder to get away.
that's okay. I understand. Frances...
you look lovely today.
she doesn't remember much anymore.
well, alzheimer's can be very unforgiving.
hello. -Oh, the other Dr. Bennett.
Hello, Frances.
Helen, is that you?
Helen was her sister. She passed away a few years ago.
I don't need those pills.
Helen, you tell him I don't need those.
of course you don't, Franny, but why don't you take them?
let's just humor him, okay?
she's got the magic touch, your wife.
okay, let's-- let's get you started.
come on, Franny.
want to stay with Helen.
that's okay, you go ahead.
uh, Franny and I have a--a lot to talk about.
how you doing today, Miss lady?
I'm okay. -Yeah? Well, you look beautiful.
it's loud.
it's loud in here, very loud.
louder in here, quieter in the exam rooms
it's good for business, better than the other way around.
so I put a rush on Danieland Laura's lab results.
you should have something by noon, and you have a new patient at 11: 00.
thank you. -I'd like to ask...
I'd like an office so I could meet with patients and finish my midwife hours.
well, give me some time. I'll see what I can come up with.
the thing is, I'd like it now.
dell, I wish we had the space, but--actually, um, I made space.
I'll get rid of the boxes.
we will get you an office, Dell, a proper one.
I need an office now, today.
all right, if you have clientsyou need to see today, you may use my office.
we will work this out, Dell.
I don't like this.
you lost weight, you're anemic, your blood pressure's way too high. This serious.
I took all of the pills you gave me.
they'll kick in soon enough.
you can't go on like this.
now I know that thingsare difficult with Frances--every day...
I lose a little bit more of her.
she hasn't been lucid in over a year.
you know, there are other ways you can look after Frances and take care of yourself.
Oh, no, Sam. I told you. I'm not gonna put her in a nursing home.
I promised her that I wouldn't years ago. We promised each other.
circumstances were different then.
you didn't know about the alzheimer's. - Sam, I promised her.
when she dies, she dies in my arms--not with strangers, in my arms.
she's the love of my life.
I will not put the love of my life... in a home.
no, Addison, wait. -Hi, there.
thank you for seeing us so last minute.
Daniel pulled me out of class. He said we had to have an ultrasound today.
I was trying to warn you.
I have an O. B. But Daniel said you were the best.
uh, I'm sorry. Uh, miss-- this is Amy, my wife.
you have two wives?
he has two wives. Did you know that? -No.
Daniel-- I didn't plan for this to happen.
I've been happily married to Amy for 12 years.
but then three years ago, I met Laura. Fell in love.
do they know about each other? -Please. You can't say anything.
it's a pretty dumb move...
bringing two wives to the same medical practice.
when you found the abnormality, I worried Amy's doctors had missed something.
Amy's due date's right around the corner.
I couldn't risk something going wrong with her delivery, with our baby.
I should throw you out of here.
I should, but I won't.
I'll go ahead and do the ultrasound because your wife--that wife--and her unborn child are the victims here.
I'm doing it for them, not you.
let me be clear about that.
so, Amy, you're a teacher?
third grade. I love kids. I always have.
we want a big family.
and it looks like you're well on your way.
everything's okay?
you see that flickering right there? That is your baby's heartbeat.
it's so fast. -that's normal.
your baby is perfectly healthy.
thank you, Dr. Montgomer thank you.
you're welcome.
you told them about Charlotte.
I didn't. I didn't. They guessed.
and what do you care? You're the one who walked out of the bar with Cruella.
my relationship with Charlotte is mine, not yours, to share or mock or...
call Cruella.
you're the one who outed your relationship. You don't have a right to be mad at me.
I'm sorry. I had a few too many drinks and I did a spontaneous thing, and now everybody knows about it, and that's...
it makes it real.
it's very, very... very real.
well, real is a good thing, right?
Yeah, I guess.
okay, look...
it's true that I don't like Cruella-- Charlotte
but that doesn't mean...
coop, you shouldn't be afraid to hope, to want it to work out.
hoping is healthy.
real is a good thing?
real's a good thing.
we are trying to workup here!
that'll help.
it's disrupting the workplace.
I want to know who's behind it. Addison can't figure it out.
I'm gonna do it myself. You want to help me?
I wish I could, nancy drew, but I have children to heal.
fine, fine. I'll gonna find out.
Hey, Sam. -Yeah.
I am thinking we should hit a bar tonight after work... Try again.
there are so many beautiful women in L. A.
Pete, Naomi and I, we just came out of a long-term relationship.
I don't know if I'm ready to...
Sam, Cooper is dating.
well, Cooper is dating the antichrist.
well, at least he's dating.
you gotta get back out there. I am promising it my mission to get you a date.
we were just--we have to go to the hospital.
Frances just had an accint.
I was helping her out of the tub, and she fell and hit her head, and I-I tried to catch her.
relax, relax.
all right, your blood pressure's high and your pulse is irregular.
how's Franny?
everything looks good, but, uh, we'll--we'll talk to the attending before we go.
Helen... please take me home.
I want to go home.
we're gonna get you home as soon as possible.
this situationis getting dangerous for the both of you.
Oh, don't start with meagain, Sam.
did they do a C. T. scan before diagnosing her with alzheimer's?
her doctor saidshe didn't need another test.
is there something wrong?
everything's fine, Henry. It's fine.
is the husband here?
Oh, the husband just left with the other wife.
Laura, Hi. I'm Dr. Freedman. -Hi.
the baby tested positivefor digeorge syndrome.
here is some informationyouunderstand the disorder, and we can go overall of it with you.
will she... will she survive?
she'll survive delivery, but life...
for a child with digeorge syndromeis...
difficult.
digeorge syndromeis a genetic disorder, and facial abnormalities.
she's gonna require surgery-- a number of surgeries.
and she'll need a lifetime of medical treatment with round-the-clock care.
what am I supposed to do, Dr. Wilder?
parents in your situation--about half of them decide to through with the pregnancy.
the other half de--oh, god. No.
end the pregnancy?
we tried for so longto get pregnant.
it took almost a year. I...
I just... I'm not ready--I'm not ready to hear this.
I need my husband here.
for all this drilling and banging?
I try to avoid manual labor, but I am leasing the space.
for what?
I'm openinga new medical practice.
you're opening a practice here?
what about Cooper?
this has nothing to do with him. -He's your riend.
this is business, and Cooper is personal.
it's not that simple. -Maybe not for you, but I am not a therapist.
I don't have to talk about my feelings until everyone else's earsbleed.
you need to tell him. -I don't need to do anything.
if you don't do it, then I will.
fine. I'll tell him.
it's disgusting.
it's disgusting and cruel.
I mean, he is using these two women. --We have to tell them.
what our patients do outside this practice is none of our business.
Oh, come on, Pete. It's illegal.
I'm not saying I like it.
I'm saying we don't have the right to say anything to either of these women.
but if Laura does decideto have this child, she's doing sounder the mistaken beliefthat she has a loyaland committed husbandto share the burdenwith her.
I don't condoneDaniel's bavior.
but the fact that he's married to two womend oesn't mean that he's not committed to staying loyal to both of them and the children.
he is a liar, and he shouldn't-- you know...
he doesn't deserve to raise those children.
that's an emotional response, not a medical one. He's their father.
so that gives him a free pass to do whatever he wants? -You can't say anything.
don't you even think about saying a wordto either of those women, or I will personally report you to the A. M.A.
are you threatening me? -don't say a word.
fine.
I won't say a word.
didn't we talk about this?
we did.
look, I can make it work. -Why is this so urgent, Dell?
okay, you don't want to talk about it. I still don't want you using this space.
I need you to get Laura Larsonand Amy Larsonback in here again todayat theame time.
okay.
listen, uh, about Peteand this dating thing
I think Francesmight not have alzheimer'S.
normal pressure hydrocephalus?
Yeah, her C. T. scan showed no evidence of acute trauma.
but there was marked dilatation in the ventricles.
now N. P.H. and alzheimer's have similar symptoms.
okay, but what difference does it make?
her body is too frail for her to be a candidate for a neurosurgical procedure.
Yeah, but there was a study that was done about ten years agoin which a spinal tap was performed to drain the excess fluid off of patients with N. P. H.
now if she has this, the tap could relieve the symptoms and give hera few brief periods of clarity.
well, that's a big if, Naomi. -It's worth a try.
the only blessing of this disease is that she's not recognition enough to understand her own situation.
do you want her to understand how bad things are?
I nt her to understandhow bad things are for Henry.
so then you'd put her through a spinal tap?
if--if this were me, if this were you and me
this is not you and me. -I know that.
well, this is a shot in the dark, Naomi.
the Frances I knew would not have wanted this for either of them, and she's the only one who can convince Henry to do what he needs to do.
Hey, uh, Laura Larsonand Amy Larson are here.
put Amy in exam room four.
which exam room do you want to put Laura in?
let me worry about Laura.
is theresomething else wrong?
no.
uh, no. No, no. I-I...
I just want to make sure that you have all the information that you need.
uh, the room's taken. I'm so sorry. Dell must havemade a mistake.
um, do the two of you mind hanging out in here for a moment while I clear this up?
that's fine.
two new moms. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.
what did you do? -Nothing.
what did you do? -I did not say a word.
just get away from me!
I've got to get out of here!
what did you do?
I didn't say a word.
you got around it by a legal technicality.
exactly, because they had the right to know.
whether they did or not, you had right to orchestrate that.
I did what I would wantsomeone to do for me, Pete.
you overstepped.
what is wrong with you today?
do you have any idea what you just did?
how long did you think you could keep up this charade?
what part of my life are you calling a charade?
take it easy.
I've been with Amy since I was 21.
she's the woman I've been happily married to for 12 years.
so happily that you went outlooking for other women?
I never stopped loving Amy, but when I met Laura, it was...
I--have you ever met someone and just known there was something between you you couldn't resist, even if you tried?
I could have been one of those guys with a wife at home and a girlfriend on the side, but I married them both because I wanted to do the right thing.
you're living a lie, Daniel.
you're cheating on two women, and cheating ruins lives.
I'm not the one who ruined lives here today.
um, as the kids would say, drama.
Addison's patients? I think it's so sad.
sad but weird.
sad but fodder for the best dinner party story ever.
Addison has--she's gone crazy and...
I love it!
why the cold shoulder?
I'm not--I'm not giving you the cold shoulder.
I'm just--I'm--I'm distracted.
I know what this is about.
you do?
it's Charlotte.
I should have told youbefore I outed us.
I'm sorry.
you can't walk out. It's your office.
he was never gonna say anything.
he had these women thinking that he's one thing, but he's not.
and the worse part is...
he only felt bad because he'd been exposed, not because of what he'd done.
you don't look surprised.
well, people lie. It's human nature.
and you're okay with that?
do you know how many guyon the force have something on the side?
I should know. I'm their alibi half the time.
and you cover for them while they're out having affairs?
these guys are like my brothers. -What about their wives back home, -just too bad for them? -I'm not encouraging it, Addison.
I'm just saying it happen.
Yeah, well, maybe it shouldn't happen.
you want to talk about last night?
what about last night?
I gotta go. It's a work thing.
we'll talk later, okay?
uh, I just talked to Henry, and he's agreed to dothe spinal tap.
Oh, all right.
well, at least you got what you wanted.
look, Sam, I know you don't agree with me on this one.
you're right. I don't. All right?
you're putting Frances at risk.
for Henry, for Frances.
I hope it is for them...
and not for you.
Hey, Addison. - I think I may have just gone too far.
with what?
I followed Kevin.
what do--what do you mean, you followed him?
at first it was just a routine surveillance.
you are not a cop.
I followed him to work, to the precinct, which is apparently where I should've stopped.
Oh, god. Where--where are you now, crazy woman?
I'm not insane. I went to the precinct.
five minutes later, he comes roaring out of the parking garage in another car, a van.
did it-- did it not occur to you that he might be working?
of course he could be working.
only maybe he's not working.
people lie, I.
they lie and they cheat and they ruin people's lives, and I am not gonna be one of those women who gets duped.
Addison--Addison, you need to be careful.
or maybe he's working.
Addison? -I gotta go.
get out of the car!
I'm sorry.
I- is there-- keep your handswhere I can see them and step out of the vehicle now!
no, no, no, no. I'm not part of any of this, though.
step out of the vehicle now.
open the door from the outside.
turn around.
what?
Wh--oh!
Oh, not handcuffs. You can't be serious.
who were you on the phone with?
Oh, no. I was talking to my friend.
were you calling someone inside that building?
no, no, no, no. I'm a doctor.
I'm--I'm a surgeon.
I can show-- -whoever you are, you're obstructing justice.
no, I can show you-- -Addison?
Hey, Kev.
you were spying on me?
not spying.
okay, yes, spying.
you want to tell me what's going on?
I just...
I spent all day dealing with a seemingly normal guy who's the liar of all liars, so...
I checked your Blackberry before you left.
you did what?
Yes, and I saw the missed calls from Leslie, and I wanted to see who she was.
well, you already have.
officer Leslie Davis.
and I wouldn't call him "she"to his face.
Oh.
why are you looking for reasons not to trust me?
fine.
Kev-- -get out.
just...just go.
Cooper the internet dateris in a healthy relationship, and my too-good-to-be-trueboyfriendthinks I'm a psychoticbunny boiler.
he'll come around.
I screwed up.
I mean, he said what he said and I...
lost my mind.
Addison, Amy and Lauraare here.
Why? - I called them.
why'd you bring us here?
I thought you should talk.
I don't want to talk about this.
I was up all night. I felt sick to my stomach.
I feel like this is my fault somehow.
I- I should've known.
neither of you did anything wrong.
you trusted the person you love.
th's the normal thing to do.
Pete's right.
Daniel is the only person here who's done anything wrong.
bastard.
look, you've both been burned, but maybe there's a way that you can help each other.
I don't want help from her.
Pete, we shouldn't-- -we should.
you share a common bond.
your children are going to be siblings.
each of you understands what the other one is feeling better than anyone else.
I feel lost.
Daniel was...
my one constant, the only thing I could always depend on.
we should've made this decision about our baby together.
I don't know if I can do this by myself.
no, no.
I-I don't know her, and I don't want to know her.
look, Amy, you're both hurting right now, but maybe there's a chance you can help each other work through this.
damn it!
I think...
I- I think my water broke.
how much longer?
just another minute.
I promise.
thank you, Helen.
how do you feel, Frances?
what?
are you...
Where's the music?
I thought there was supposed to be music.
she's gonna be fine.
the worst isver.
no, look at her. I never should've put her through this.
this may work, Henry, and it could give you...
at least something.
if only I can talk with her, even for a minute, look into her eyes and know that she sees me, really sees me.
okay, Amy...
you're about 8 centimeters dilated. How are you feeling?
Daniel was supposed to be here.
if you want me to, I'll call him.
I don't want to see him.
but I don't want to be alone.
you haven't told Cooper the truth yet.
you're not very good at letting things go, are you?
you know what I think?
I think you're scared.
of what?
I think this relationship is getting real, so you're just as scared as Cooper is.
so you're trying to sabotage it.
take a new job, rent the floor under him, keep it from him
you want this to blow up in your face.
you know what I think?
I think you're not half the shrink you think you are.
where are you going?
to tell Cooper the truth.
why isn't she responding?
we knew we could only try, Henry.
remember the last november, we were at home?
it was raining and cold.
you were reading in your chair.
I saw you shivering, and I asked you if you wanted me to turn the heat up.
and you smiled, and you said yes.
so I went downstairs and turned the thermostat up.
and when I came back up, I told you I- I had done it.
but you didn't know me.
that was the last time we spoke.
please don't let that be our last memory together.
we need a new memory.
this is too hard for him.
Frances, it's me...
your husband is here and he needs your help.
you--you need to do this for him.
I'm sorry, Henry.
I'm so sorry there wasn't more that we could do for her.
I understand.
where am I? -You're here now.
that's what's important.
you look so beautiful.
you look so tired.
I've missed you.
I've missed you every day.
Frances, Henry promised you that he would never put you in a nursing home.
I'm sick, aren't I?
Yeah.
you'll visit me every day.
you'll come see me every day and hold my hand.
you promise me that?
but, Franny-- -you promise me that, Henry.
and then...
you let me go.
promise me, my love.
I promise.
okay, Amy, on three, I'm gonna need you to push, all right?
ready? One, two, three.
push.
good. That's good. Good.
now take a breath.
I hate him!
concentrate on your baby.
I'm trying.
breathe. -It's--it's so hard.
no.
no.
take my hand.
no. -Just take my hand.
we'll do this together, okay?
you can trust me.
okay, when I say push again, you're gonna push, Amy, all right?
and ready? -You can do this.
no.
push.
we need to talk.
thank god.
What--what do you mean, thank god?
I mean something's been bothering you.
you haven't been yourself.
okay, I feel like you think that because I'm with Charlotteand things are going well that I'm not gonna be there for you, but I--I'm here for you, Violet.
and the fact that Charlotte and I are great doesn't change that.
okay?
let's talk.
Oh, okay.
I've...
just...
you know what? You just said it.
I- I think I was worried about you and Charlotte and what that meant, but...
I just want to see you happy, Coop.
it's a wonderful facility, Henry.
she'll have her own room with 24-hour care.
for the first time in almost 50 years, we won't be living together.
you gonna be okay?
I have to be.
I promised her.
what's wrong?
that man loves that woman more than anything in the world.
he stayed with her, for better, for worse, and, uh, now they're gonna be apart.
just because they're not gonna beliving together anymore, just because...
they won'tbe sleeping in the same bed or having the same conversations, it doesn't mean he's gonna stop loving her.
that man is going to love her always.
he's gonna love her until the day he dies, but...
he needs to move on.
I need to know everything there is to know about digeorge syndrome because I'm gonna keep my baby, and I need to be prepared.
I can't stay with somebodyI can't trust.
we are gonna be there for you, for whatever you need.
Amy, Laura, hear me out.
stay away from me.
you need to leave.
Hey, I'm talking to them, not you.
no, not anymore.
please. I need to see them.
they don't want to see you.
don't make this worse by-- -I love them.
I want to help.
Amy just gave birth.
Laura is dealing witha pregnancy that's taken a very difficult turn.
and they both just found out the man they love is a liar.
don't make this worse.
if you really love them, if you want to help...
leave.
you want me to walk away, to walk away from them?
right now, yes.
and they may never want to see you again.
that's something you're gonna have to live with.
but you married them, you made commitments, and you have children.
what I'm saying is that you are gonna spend the rest of your life making sure that Amy and Laura and these children are taken care of.
he still hasn't called?
no.
I'm sure it's not as bad as it seems.
Oh, no, it is.
I will never hear that sexy, S. W. A. T.- voice again.
this here is my desk, and this is my chair.
pretty cool, right? -I like it.
can I spin?
Yeah, you can spin.
meet Betsey.
Betsey, this is Addison and Naomi, and these are daddy's friends.
can you say hello, please?
Hi.
your daughter?
w- why didn't you tell us?
go make me a picture, okay?
I'll put you here.
well, I wanted to, um...
but...
it's a little compliced.
I was 17...
and her mom and I weren't together very long.
and now?
well, uh, her mother's an addict, and last month, she relapsed.
I just...
I just wanted her to be proud of me, um, you know, to see that one of her parents had it together.
that's why I brought her here.
Addison, I promise I'll have it all cleared out by tomorrow, okay?
Hey, Betsey.
how do you like your daddy's office?
I love it.
yeah?
I think I'm ready.
to leave?
to date.
okay. Yeah.
so what happens now?
this is gonna be harder than I thought.
so...
I told them...
you're my girlfriend, and if they didn't like that, they were gonna have to deal with me.
you did?
what about Violet?
I think she was worried about us coming out, but...
I took care of it.
that's it?
she's happy for me...
for us.
I guess I misjudged her.
did you bring your squad car?
I need an explanation, Addison.
I chted on my husband...
with his best friend.
and after that...
my ex-husband cheated on me, too.
so when you said, uh, you said...
"I love you,"it took everything to this whole other place, this dark place where the stakes were high.
I couldn't trust you--not because of you--because of me.
and I think I was scared because I do like you.
I like you...
a lot, Kevin, and I am...
not in a place where I can say what you said, but...
I think if you were to stick around a little while,
I might be able to get there, because you are honest and loyal and worthy of trust.
I messed up.
but I think...
I might get there.
mentalist
someone who uses mental acuity, hypnosis or suggestion.
a master manipulator of thoughts and behavior.
wow, Scarlett just throws the best parties.
I'm gonna go find Asra.
then I'll see who I can find.
there's Victor.
call an ambulance!
mom.
no, Oscar, stay up there!
look at it, George.
beautiful, isn't it?
look at that.
don't you feel happy and relaxed?
Yes.
say it. Tell me how you feel.
happy and relaxed.
that's good. That's very good.
so tell me, George, what's your date of birth?
I was born on the 1st of March...
and what's your mother's name?
that's-- that's a very nice name.
she was a good woman.
she liked you to tell the truth, didn't she, George?
Yes.
so tell me, how did you murder Donovan Hobar.
Jane, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we just caught a red ball.
you gonna be much longer with this one?
damn it, jane. He's in a trance, isn't he?
Wha--I'd describe it more as a-a deep relaxation.
hypnotized. You hypnotized him.
well, I was doing a favor for the organized crime unit.
those cowboys?
time to go, guys.
you know, I was just about to get the truth out of him.
uh, he killed two people.
if you walk very quietly to the door, I still might
how many times have I told you--no hypnotism?
it's illegal, and it's unethical, and you cannot keep on doing it.
just calm yourself, woman. It's no big thing.
Oh, really?
this man's lawyer is right this minute coming down the hallway, wearing a mean face.
something tells me he'll argue that point with you. Let's go.
well, let me get him out of his trance first, huh?
well, be quick about it.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like to speak to my client alone.
of course. - Now.
George, nice to talk to you.
good luck with all your future endeavors.
that's mine.
so, George... George? Are you all right?
it's not funny.
it is a little. What do you got?
unincorporated country club development outside of town, ,Scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.
hostess of the party, married, one kid.
right about 10: 20 this evening, the party was in full swing.
scarlett comes runng over the balcony, clutching her throat and screaming.
she falls down to her death.
Where's the husband and the kid?
they're with neighbors, badly shook up.
we'll wait to talk to them until tomorrow morning.
poison, huh? - Must be.
frothing at the lips, discoloration.
the medical examiner thinks so, too.
but we haven't found the source yet.
we don't know where she ingested the poison.
she came from up there, but the actual poisoning could've taken place anywhere.
it's a big uh, just a moment.
excuse me.
that's interesting.
look. Look at her eyes. - What?
Hello? Use your words.
she had more mascara on her right eye than she did on her left,
which means that she was halfway through reapplying her makeup when she was poisoned, so...
she was in the... Bathroom.
the source of the poison, I have no doubt.
what do we got here?
motive.
Mr. Marquesa, I'm agent Lisbon, CBI.
Yes, thanks for coming.
these are dear friends, Asra Hadami and Mandy Riljek.
they've been looking after me and Oscar.
anything we can do.
vic, I'll make sure Jim stops by as soon as he gets back into town.
Thanks, Mandy.
take care, Victor.
please. Come in.
scarlett kept everything in here.
very organized.
we'll get it back to you just as soon as we can.
thank you.
the tox screen tells us your wife's drink was laced with rat poison.
rat poison.
who would do such a thing?
somebody who wanted to get even?
who's your guess? Whose name just popped into your head?
scarlett had no enemies.
everyone loved Scarlett.
even Asra?
Asra? Yes, they got along fine. Why ask about her?
you're having an affair with Asra, aren't you?
what? No.
no? Really? - No. Really.
and what the heck kind of police are you, anyhow, asking me a question like that?
sorry, my mistake.
are you business partners?
she's my accounts manager.
Ah, okay. Now I understand.
understand what?
doesn't matter. Do you know where her keys are?
I can't find 'em. They're not in here.
I couldn't find them. I wanted to move her car.
not to worry. I'm sure they'll show up.
what is it you do for a living, exactly?
I develop real estate.
it's a tough market.
tell me about it. But I'm confident that it'll turn around soon.
and did Scarlett work with you?
no, she was the artistic type.
she made jewelry. That was her thing.
made a pretty good business out of it, in fact...
selling to friends and neighbors.
well, what kind of jewelry was it? Was it expensive stuff?
no. Just trinkets, really-- earrings, bracelets...
can we see some?
sure.
that's very nice.
was there any particular reason for the party last night?
Scarlett's idea.
she, um, thought it was necessary to let people know we're doing fine.
and we are... doing fine.
did anybody at the party behave in an unusual manner?
any odd incidents? - No.
and you knew everybody at the party personally?
Yes, good friends.
Oh, we're gonna need a list.
sure. From the country club, mostly.
scarlett was elected chair of her women's committee there.
it's a big deal in this community, very prestigious.
I was so proud of her, but it meant she had to spend a lot more time at-- at the club.
Oscar. Stop. Please.
pardon me. Um, are we done here?
no, that's all for now. we'll be in touch if we need anything else.
very nice.
what's your deal with Asra Hadami?
well, you saw the dinner theater way in which she hugged Victor.
she's deceiving him.
I thought it was a love affair gone awry, but it isn't.
it's something else.
she's probably stealing from him.
I'll have Van Pelt pull her financials at the same time she pulls the Marquesas'.
you know, we should go take a look at this country club.
Yeah, talk to the women's committee she chairs. Bring Rigsby with you.
someone here knows the truth.
and how so?
well, poison and a message in lipstick says this murder was done by a woman.
and women have no secrets from other women.
well, unless it was a cunning man posing as a woman.
what, you think? - No.
semifinal pairs, players 23 and 45 to court one now, please. 23 and 45 to court one.
good morning, ma'am. California Bureau of Investigation. I'm detective Rigsby. This is Jane.
Hi, Heather. Nice to meet you.
everyone's been expecting you. Poor Scarlett. It's terrible.
how can I help you?
we'd like to start by talking to members of the women's committee.
sure thing.
uh, perhaps we'd, uh, gather them more discreetly?
Oh, everyone will know in minutes, anyhow.
Jackie, Patience, Mandy, the police are here, and they want to talk to us about Scarlett's murder.
come to the rose courtyard.
and, everybody, the silent auction closes shortly, so get those bids in now, folks.
I'll show you the way.
I love a silent auction.
so, uh, let's start with some names.
uh, Patience Broadbent... Mandy Riljek you've met. Jackie Shaper.
thank god you're here.
you're gonna find this maniac, won't you?
we'll try. Uh, were you all at Scarlett's party?
Yes.
Yes, we all have to go to the chairwoman's parties. It's a rule.
the chairwoman is a prestigious position, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it is.
she would make her fair share of enemies, I'd expect.
you could say that.
if you have something to say, say it.
speak your mind, bitch.
Oh, okay. You want it all out there?
he asked about enemies, and that's what you were.
she hated Scarlett because she wanted to be chair, and Scarlett whipped her butt in the election.
schooled her, right, Mandy?
Oh, I'm not getting into this one.
right. I missed out on scoring the private office with all that cool stationery with my name on it.
so I killed her.
have you any idea how idiotic you sound?
you're the idiot.
tell you what. It's probably best if we conduct interviews with each of you separately.
you're always so jealous of everybody.
do you rember anything odd happening the night of the party?
I don't know. It was just the usual mojitos and chitchat, but...
but what?
I don't know if I should tell you this, but I-I saw Scarlett arguing with Asra Hadami.
it looked kind of angry.
some say something more than business might be going on between Asra Hadami and Victor Marquesa.
I don't know if that's true, and I don't really follow the gossip.
who does?
we're told you're the gossip queen around here.
people tell me things.
so... Who's having an affair with Victor Marquesa?
I don't know. Who? Tell.
that's a funny idea?
no, it's just... No.
Victor and Asra are good friends, nothing more.
Asra had nothing to do with this. - No?
what's the general opinion? Who did this?
my guess? - Yeah.
what makes you think that?
nothing, really. I mean, Victor's a nice guy, but that's who kills women, isn't it?
their husbands, 90% of the time.
70%, I think.
he's right.
that was some great play.
you could maybe do a little more topspin on your returns, but it was a very nice play.
the answers are yes, I disliked her, no, I didn't kill her.
you hate to lose, don't you?
Yes, unlike all those many people that love it.
I'm in the semifinals, for god sake. - Yeah. Oh, of course.
good luck with that.
Yeah, I have to go.
I have another match in half an hour, and that toxic dwarf, Mandy Riljek,
is trying to outbid me in the silent auction.
what she needs two romantic nights for at the Cliffside? I don't know.
so I'll save us all some time and tell you who did this, if you like.
I'd like that very much.
Really? Why?
she's having an affair with Victor.
how do you know that?
I just have an eye for that stuff.
Asra must have killed Scarlett so that she could have Victor for herself.
don't know why. If you ask me, he's a loser.
well, thank you.
Oh, by the way, if you disliked Scarlett marquesa so much, why are you wearing earrings that she made?
she makes good earrings. It's nice to meet you.
nice meeting you, too.
you two were close, weren't you?
we were very close.
being her deputy in the women's committee, we spoke every day.
uh, did you notice anything, uh, different, about, uh, your conversations?
she talked a lot about moving away.
she was so tired of keeping up at all costs.
at all costs?
just working so hard. - Do you have a key for this?
Oh, no. Only Scarlett has a key.
this is the chairwoman's office, and that's the chairwoman's safe.
that makes sense.
I don't know anything about that.
Scarlett's keys are missing. That's interesting.
we need to get that safe open.
we're gonna need a search warrant for that.
I'm on it.
did you get anything from Scarlett's friends?
well, everybody has a different theory.
they're all hiding something. I don't know what.
did you hear anything from forensics about the lipstick on the napkin?
not yet. They're jammed up, as usual. Budget cuts.
boss, I just now got access to Asra Hadami's financials.
she cleared out her bank accounts this morning.
checking, savings-- took out about $125, 000 in cash.
going on the run maybe?
she didn't happen to buy any rat poison recently, did she?
that would be nice, but no. No record of it.
that was the Marsante security patrol calling.
they just found Hadami's house empty. She's gone.
great. A fugitive.
I-I know where she is.
CBI.
boss? I've been here nearly six months now, half a year.
what do you want? Half a cake?
I want to take lead on this interview.
okay.
okay? - Yeah. Sure.
Thanks, boss.
why were you running, miss Hadami?
no reason. Stress. I need space.
nothing to do with the argument you had with Scarlett Marquesa the night she died?
I didn't have an argument with her.
we hear differently.
no argument.
I swear, I didn't kill her. This is absurd.
no more absurd than you clearing out your accounts and abandoning your home for no reason.
maybe I need a lawyer.
say the word.
what he'll tell you--if you're not involved in the murder
best speak up.
I ran because I knew the murder would expose some issues that I would like to keep private.
such as your relationship with Mandy Riljek?
exactly. News like that could be ruinous.
true, but not the kind of thing you abandon your house for.
you said "issues." What are the other issues?
I didn't wanna have to look Victor in the face
and tell him I'd helped run everything he worked so hard for into the ground.
how did you help do that?
I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
how much?
a little over half a million.
and where did it go?
I made some poor investment choices that I had to cover quickly.
so you stole--- - I borrowed from the reserve.
I skimmed the money from each development deal that should have gone into the company's reserve account as backup.
we were making so many deals.
I knew I'd get it back before it would matter.
but then the deals and the funding dried up, and suddenly, that reserve became very important.
I sold anything I could get my hands on to cover the money.
take a seat.
why am I even here? I've done nothing wrong.
be with you in just one moment.
please.
well, you were found in a compromising position with a murder suspect.
how did you know how to find us anyway?
you been spying on me?
well, you outbid patience for a romantic weekend, and your husband Jim's away.
and you laughed at the idea of Victor and Asra as lovers.
nobody knows I'm here, right?
if this gets out, it'll be a huge scandal.
nobody knows you're here.
sign this, and you're good to go.
judge's clerk says we won't get a search warrant for Scarlett's safe until tomorrow morning.
then we'll go in and tear the place apart.
sorry.
you didn't hear that. It's confidential.
confidential? Oh, of course.
no, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?
I understand. May I leave now?
Yeah, please.
not bad. Your delivery was a bit wooden.
Wooden? Me?
Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.
I can't believe it.
Asra's been with me for over five years.
I mean, she was with me in the trenches.
I can't believe this.
after going over your accounts, we had a couple of questions.
sure.
you've talked about cash crises in your business,
but regular cash deposits were made to your personal accounts, somewhere upwards of $5, 000.
Scarlett's deposits.
Oscar, come get your lunch.
those are some pretty hefty deposits for somebody not really working.
Where'd the money come from?
uh, her jewelry business.
I thought you said it was a small side business.
well, it was, but recently her pieces were getting a lot of interest,
and apparently, uh, she made a deal with a couple of boutiques.
do you know which ones?
I never asked.
without her money, you would have fallen behind months ago.
I know all too well it was my wife who had to save our butts recently.
dad? - What's the matter?
you made it wrong.
mommy never puts all this stuff in it.
she knows I like it plain.
can we make a compromise, buddy?
I-I need to talk to these nice police ladies.
now I'll make it better next time. I promise.
now would you please just eat the sandwich?
sorry about that. - It's not a problem.
according to your wife's phone records, she traded a lot of calls with several disposable cell phones.
well, I don't know who she would have been talking to.
in her day planner, she had a regular weekly date noted down with an address in Marysville.
she had one scheduled for later today.
do you know anything about that?
no, I don't know what that's about,
but I know she used to go to Marysville a lot for the antique jewelry markets and stuff.
excuse me.
results on the lipstick.
no traces of DNA were found, but the color, "tongue in cheek,"
is a limited edition, sold only in a few high-end stores.
tongue in cheek-- that's cute.
look, secure access to each of the stores receipt records so we can search through them.
then I want you to meet us at 65434 east boulevard.
it's in Marysville. - On my way.
I'll, uh, I'll catch up to you.
who's winning?
Oh, I don't know. I don't follow the play, to be honest.
Yeah, it's kind of silly, isn't it?
everybody's so serious over a game.
exactly. Like it matters who wins a stupid trophy.
I guess people feel they need a purpose.
Yeah, well, my purpose died this year at the age of 16.
I'm sorry. Boy or girl? - Girl.
high as a kite with one of her friends. She wrapped her car around a tree.
friend got away without a scratch, thank God.
what was her name?
once you lose a child, all this striving seems kinda ridiculous, you know?
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do.
why not leave it all behind? Just go away?
I can't afford to leave. I have negative equity on my house.
Oh, nice play, Karen!
besides, these are my friends. This is all I have.
according to Scarlett's planner, the meeting's here.
let's see if we can spot the contact.
I don't know. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Hi, guys. What are you doing?
get up. This way.
I should have brought some snacks.
I don't see this working in a hurry.
Ah, you shouldn't go hungry long.
Mandy's news will have spread quickly.
everyone knows that tomorrow, the safe will be opened.
it's now or never for whoever took Scarlett's keys.
Hey, easy there.
that is antique mexican silver.
maybe next time you'll think before trying to outrun an officer of the law.
I'm assuming this isn't candy.
why were you meeting Scarlett Marquesa?
so we could exchange beauty secrets.
you mind if I smoke?
Yeah, I do.
van Pelt, what do you got?
wardell Suggs, a.k.a. "Digger."
he's been arrested for several counts of petty theft, fraud and assault.
that's very impressive.
it could be better.
why were you meeting Scarlett?
What'd she tell you about me?
nothing. She's dead.
I-I didn't have anything to do with that.
Hey, boss, come take a look.
would you look at that? The mother lode. Let's talk, huh?
the hell, I got a strike to give.
scarlett was one of my biggest customers.
painkillers, tranquilizers, diet pills-- by the hundreds.
scarlett was dealing prescription drugs? - Yep.
where did you two meet?
swap meet.
she was trying to sell that god-awful jewelry.
she looked desperate, so I told her there's easier ways to make money.
were you doing a deal tonight?
supposed to.
lately, I've been having to listen to her yammer about quitting.
then she'd buy some bag, saying this is the last time she's doing it.
of course she'd always come back.
she was gonna quit? - Yep.
a matter of fact, last couple of weeks, I've been getting calls from another girl,
saying Scarlett gave her my info.
same prissy kind of voice.
chick said she'd be interested in setting up her own situation when Scarlett quit.
does this chick have a name?
you know, I'm not big on names at first, but I do have her number.
why don't you give her a call?
digger, why are you calling me now?
uh, in your own time, man, if you'd like to take a seat.
thank you so much, ma'am.
how did you come to have Scarlett Marquesa's keys?
I took them when I went to offer my condolences to Victor.
naughty I know, but I couldn't wait.
it's not naughty. It's a felony.
you wanted to get your hands on her pill supply.
nonsense.
I opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
I had no idea there were any pills in there.
I simply wanted to measure the windows for new drapes.
I'll be the next chair of the committee.
then why not wait till it's official?
am I here because of keys?
explain the nature of your relationship with Wardell Suggs.
who?
I liked his jewelry. - Okay.
were you aware that Scarlett Marquesa was selling illegal prescription drugs in the Villa Marsante estates?
who didn't know?
well, except for you all.
if everyone knew, then why didn't anyone come forth?
and risked being ostracized or caught up in the vulgarity of it all?
not likely.
she was doing a booming business, and you wanted to be part of it, maybe a little too much.
so I killed her? Please.
hello. She was a drug dealer.
the people she dealt with must have done her in-- other dealers.
or a highly capable rival straight in the middle of her own community?
you have found no drugs or poison on me or in my home.
the keys were taken aftershe was killed, and I only opened that safe out of idle curiosity.
you taped together your whole theory with a couple of random conversations I've had with a drug dealer.
does that about sum it up?
well, when she puts it like that, it does seem pretty thin.
Yeah. She's a piece of work, isn't she?
we're gonna have to cut her loose for now, but I think some discreet surveillance might help our cause.
if you were thinking of trying that on, don't. Not your shade.
what do you think about older women?
where is this coming from? I don't think about older women. My mother's an older woman.
not old old, just older, you know? Older than you.
why you asking?
you're not trying to set me up with somebody, are you?
it turns out--if you look at the available scientific evidence on the internet
and they've got less hang-ups, they like themselves way more than younger women,
and they're at their sexual peak.
I mean, that's what the research says anyhow.
what the hell happened to you at that country club?
nothing. I'm just saying that-- Oh, no. She spotted us.
afternoon, boys.
I was making myself a pani and thought I'd bring you some, too.
Thanks, ma'am.
Oh, and just so you know, I am headed to the club for a massage,
so you don't need to follow too close.
relax. Have a bite to eat first. I'll see you there.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am, thank you, ma'am. What is wrong with you?
well, she surprised me.
what's in the sandwiches?
well, it's a pani, if you don't mind.
it's, uh, ham and cheese. - Yeah, who knows what else?
drugs? I can't believe it.
using jewelry sales as a cover, your wife was dealing prescription drugs-- painkillers mostly.
speed, diet pills.
some of them were coming in from Mexico, other ones were stolen from pharmacies.
you seem genuinely surprised.
a lot of people around here knew about her.
I had no idea.
you don't think I had something to do with this?
she was moving an awful lot of inventory.
I had nothing to do with this.
how could you have not known she was medicating half the women in the neighborhood?
she lied to me.
maybe she was just trying to protect me from the shame.
or maybe it was easier just to turn a blind eye, as long as the money was coming in.
no. If I had known she was doing this, I would have tried to stop her.
I'm Patrick.
you want to talk, Oscar?
pretty heavy stuff going on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your mom.
me, too.
my dad is sad because you guys can't find who did it.
but I don't mind about that.
I just want her back.
she can't come back. You know that, don't you?
I know that. I'm 9.
I will never see her again until I'm dead, too.
then I'll go stay with her in heaven.
well, that sounds good.
but you know what I noticed you're really good at that could help you right now?
what?
make-believe.
Yeah. I am.
you are very good at it.
a master like you, you wanted to talk to your mom,
you could make-believe she was here and do whatever you like. I do it all the time.
you talk to my mom? - No, not your mom. I talk to my wife.
she's dead? - Yeah. Yeah.
but I talk to her all the time. You should try it. It's very good.
I guess. - Well, whatever.
this is cool.
you any good with this sword?
I'm okay.
Oh, really?
I got you!
please. Mercy. Mercy.
fair maiden. D'artagnan, I have to go. Good-bye.
Ugh, spa stuff takes forever.
how long can a massage be?
no, they do all sorts of things to you besides a massage-- facials, waxing, mud.
how do you know so much?
I bought a certificate for my mom.
Wayne. You're back again. How nice.
Hi, Mrs. Shaper.
now you know, you must call me jackie.
and it's "Ms." Not "Mrs." divorced.
sorry... Jackie.
he was a good man, but weak, essentially. He just couldn't see.
wait. What are you wearing on your lips?
excuse me? - The color. What--what color is this?
tongue in cheek. You like it?
where did you get it?
I bought it at the boutique in town.
how long have you been wearing this shade?
I just bought it today.
I saw it on Patience Broadbent at Scarlett's party.
I just had to have it.
it's a crazy price, but what the heck?
you're positive that it's tongue in cheek?
I have it right here.
and you definitely saw Patience wearing it first at Scarlett Marquesa's party?
is that a pickup line?
no detectable prints on the knife.
surveillance tapes?
the spa didn't believe in them. Something to do with disturbing the chi.
I don't get it. Why kill Patience? Why now?
perhaps it was part of the plan all along.
no, this was hasty. Patience became the new target.
revenge for Scarlett's death?
Victor was quick to anger.
Rigsby, find out Victor Marquesa's recent whereabouts.
Yes, boss.
it could have been someone else.
the competition wiping out the dealer and her heir apparent or...
or what?
Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?
Yeah.
can you believe that Patience got stabbed?
it's like a mafia hit.
I'm never going in that spa again, I will tell you that.
tragic set of events.
I didn't see it coming.
so what do you think? This is some kind of drug war?
could be, but stabbings are usually crimes of passion.
this is, uh, this is very personal.
so what's next?
CBI are already putting the pieces together.
in fact, uh... W--never mind.
what?
no, I-I shouldn't talk about it 'cause it's still an ongoing case.
you know, you can't just leave something like that hanging.
well, I'm sorry, you know, but I will get myself in a lot of trouble.
Oh, come on, girls.
all right, listen.
can you promise me that this will just stay between us?
Yes. Yes, of course.
you promise? - I promise.
okay, we're going after Victor Marquesa.
Victor? Oh, I don't believe it. He doesn't even look like the type.
on what grounds?
we think that he killed Patience out of revenge for the murder of his wife.
but you said there was no proof Patience was guilty.
I guess Victor didn't want to wait around for proof.
what's gonna happen to Oscar?
mother murdered, now dad's a murder.
once they arrest the father, he'll be placed in foster care.
Oh, how dreadful.
that poor child. - It is.
I guess they couldn't keep the secret.
guess they can't.
let's do it.
it's gonna be all right, son. -Dad!
I promise. - No!
it's gonna be okay. - Where are you going?
don't worry! I'll be right back!
No! Dad!
come back! No! No, no, no.
stop, stop, stop. You have to stop this.
no. No, we can't. This is justice being served.
how can you say that? Look what you're putting that boy through.
he'll forget eventually. It's fine.
no. No, he won't. No. No, it's not. - It's fine. Why?
because I did it! I killed them.
I killed them both. Oh, god.
I first suspected it was you because it seemed that everybody else at the club wore some of Scarlett's jewelry,
but not you.
that's it? Jewelry?
the more we talked, the more I felt your pain and anger.
losing your daughter has unhinged you.
Unhinged?
Yeah, I suppose it has.
my daughter...
she loved to dance.
didn't matter what kind of music either, a toe would start tapping and...
she was just so full of life.
she had taken several inkillers with alcohol before she got behind the wheel.
one of her neighborhood friends got them from her mother who got them from Scarlett.
I understand your anger.
it was like they ripped my soul out clean.
but the rest of the world just kept moving right along.
it was like I was the only one who remembered what happened.
so when I...Saw her flitting about town, selling her pills without a care in the world,
still hosting parties at her house, happily dancing around without a stitch of the misery I was carrying, I snapped.
I killed her.
I didn't want any other person to have to experience what I did.
and Patience?
she told everyone at the club not to worry.
she was gonna take over Scarlett's business and keep the pills coming,
like nothing had happened, like no lessons had been learned.
I had to finish what i started.
I had to.
I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.
now that it's done, does it feel better?
it doesn't change a thing.
agent Lisbon.
Mr. Marquesa, hi.
I want to thank you and your team.
although, I must admit, that whole scene in front of the house
it was make-believe, dad.
sorry. The make-believe was a bit unorthodox and unpleasant,
but I'm sure you all know what you're doing.
most of the time.
I want to apologize if we were tough on you.
no, it's what I needed to hear.
we're moving out of Villa Marsante and headed back to my hometown.
my son and I have a lot of catching up to do.
take care. - Thanks.
Mr. Jane.
thank you.
Oh, it's nothing. Forget about it.
take care. Good luck. Bye.
another minute, and I would have missed 'em.
I do hate it when people say thank you. - Why?
he likes to play the lone ranger.
who was that masked man? I never got a chance to thank him.
exactly.
uh, I don't want to alarm you, but your friend jackie has just walked in behind you,
and she is looking fierce.
Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.
my name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until
we got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted.
when you're burned, you've got nothing. No cash, no credit, no job history.
you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
where am I? - Miami.
you do whatever work comes your way.
you rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
a trigger-happy girlfriend... - Should we shoot them?
an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
you know spies. Bunch of bitchy little girls.
family too... - Hey, is that your mom again?
if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael.
and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
that's how we do it, people.
bottom line-- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.
it's a deep cover job going after the leader of a terrorist network.
two hour notice to get to Cuba to bust somebody out of a Russian black site?
it's a woman. That's all I know.
she must be pretty damn important.
she could be the key to what his group is up to.
I want a seat at the table, Sonya.
to do what we do, you have to be willing to give up everything.
I have nothing!
my friends... They moved on.
you're the only thing I have left.
michael Allen Westen, welcome.
I am the man you've been waiting to meet.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know.
old loyalties die hard, and I need to know that you've left yours behind.
who was your training officer?
when were you recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency?
describe your relationship. A man who has no secrets can trust himself.
I told you. This one's a keeper.
I'm James.
welcome to the family.
there are few things riskier than taking down a high priority target during a meeting in a public place.
you're usually operating alone, out of radio contact, surrounded by civilians, while your support has to stay out of sight, often blocks away, so they won't be detected.
okay, everybody, this is it. Target's at the meeting with Westen at noon.
we are now at three minutes until noon. Bravo team, you got anything?
nothing yet. - Alpha team?
no sign of them. - You get stood up, sweetheart?
no, I'm just early.
the hardest part of the job is that, until the target shows up, your job is to just sit there and try to act natural.
the thing to remember is that you're not just setting a trap, you're also the bait.
all right, well, look sharp, everybody.
you see James, you see anybody who could be James, you call it in.
we're not gonna miss this son of a bitch.
you dropped your phone, hon. A customer found it.
Oh, that's not my phone.
sweetheart, I'm pretty sure it is.
sweet, little boy. Is he yours?
he's my nephew. Uh, yes, this is my phone. Thank you.
incoming Call Blocked - A little late. - I believe I'm right on time, Michael.
I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.
don't worry. We will.
get me ears on that call now.
I'm trying, sir, but it looks like every call in the state is being routed through that tower, I can't just
get the NSA on it, then. Get me on that call!
let me guess. You're changing the venue.
there's a car waiting at the corner of Collins and 7th. It leaves in two minutes. Be there.
what if I don't make it? - You will.
Westen's moving. Keep eyes on him but don't get too close.
he's running south on 5th. - Alpha team on it.
he just cut onto Main. - I've got visual.
he's taking the stairs at Coral Plaza.
we're cut off. Rerouting now. - Don't lose him!
Bravo, where are you?
heading north on Grant, sir. I don't see him.
he just cut out of a garage onto Bayview.
I'm two blocks away. - Find him!
who's got him?
somebody tell me we have eyes on Michael Westen.
we lost him, sir. He's gone.
for a spy, the strain of a deep cover assignment goes beyond just being alone, surrounded by enemies who'd kill you if they knew your identity.
if you want to survive, you can't let any of that strain show.
you have to project total confidence, total comfort, and greet your enemies like old friends.
Michael. Welcome. How was your trip?
car, boat, helicopter, car again.
you didn't want to throw a train in for good measure?
it's not a bad idea. Talk to logistics. See what they can do.
a lot of trouble to get to-- where am I, exactly?
wherever you go, there you are. Michael.
James, I passed your little loyalty test.
why do I get the sense you still don't trust me?
you wouldn't be within 100 miles of this place if I didn't trust you.
then why keep me in the dark?
you spent your whole life in the dark working for the CIA.
I'm just turning on the lights.
come on. Lot to talk about.
nice. Very... clean.
that's true.
in my experience, all you need to get things done is the right plan, right people.
good cup of coffee doesn't hurt.
now, have you had the chance to recuperate since our last meeting?
I slept for two days.
it was a necessary unpleasantry.
I had to understand the core of you, what makes you tick.
do you know why you're here, Michael? My skills, my training.
no. Well, that's part of it, of course, but no.
because of what you've seen. What you've done.
you still have a soul.
I don't understand. - Let me ask you something.
in your career, how many times have you had to execute an action that you knew was morally wrong for the mission?
you make a deal with someone who you know is a monster because you had to follow orders?
too many times. - I was the same, once.
then one day I was done with that.
I can't fight and bleed for men without principle anymore.
that's why I've created this network...
to be the conscience, to do the right thing.
now, when we find a monster, we don't make a deal with it.
we destroy it.
is that something that you'd be interested in?
I wouldn't be within 100 miles of this place if I wasn't.
well...
there's your first monster. Marco Cabral.
he was brought up in the DR, educated in England. Came back home and got himself a job.
Sevret intelligence Services MI6
head of the Dominican Narcotics Police. - Correct.
he's also the DR's biggest drug smuggler.
he used his position to slaughter his rivals, exploit the less fortunate, take over.
and now he's arranged a deal with the Brits in exchange for his intelligence network.
he gets a very comfortable retirement in England.
I want you to get to him first.
I want you to bring him to me.
this operation has to be precise, quiet, under the radar, so you may select one person.
any resources you need will be provided. And there's one last thing.
when Burke found you in the DR, he was working on this.
I think he'd want you to finish it for him.
so...
it would be an honor.
this everything?
organized by date, going back 15 years. The pattern is clear.
good. Good work. Make sure I have hard copies of this for the trip.
strong. Any word on Mike?
no, nothing yet. Axe is on his way down to join him now.
they're doing some kind of job for James, but that's all we know.
so, what, we're just sitting on our hands?
no, Porter, actually we've been quite busy going over the financial records that Fiona and Michael stole a few weeks ago.
and we have a new lead. - Okay. What is it?
it's not what, it's who.
looks like James has a friend in Biloxi.
a mental patient. He's been paying his bills for years.
Really? Why? What's-- what's so special about the guy?
well, that's what you and Glenanne are gonna help me find out.
Yeah, I don't know if Fi's gonna be down for a last-minute CIA excursion.
I don't really care what she's down for, Porter.
both of you are getting your butts on that plane.
wheels up in four hours, and I will see you there.
okay, fine. Since you asked so nicely, I'll talk to her.
you sure you have to meet Maddie right now?
you can't just call her, say you can't make it?
she was upset, it sounded urgent.
Yeah, I get it, I get it, but we got a CIA plane waiting for us right now.
if we're late strong is gonna be pissed.
I'm more worried about what Madeline Westen will do if I blow her off.
fair enough. Just be quick, please.
Hey, Charlie.
say hi to Aunt Fiona. - Hi, Aunt Fiona.
draw grandma a cigarette. That'll be nice, honey.
I have to pick this. - Okay.
I'm gonna go talk to Aunt Fiona, all right?
okay. - I'm keeping an eye on you.
what's up? I have a pretty busy day.
Yeah, I know. Um, actually...
that's what I want to talk to you about.
your busy day.
I got a call from your boyfriend about your busy day.
Carlos called you? - Yes.
I know, this is beyond awkward, coming from me.
but he's worried, and he knows you and I are friends, and I'm the only person he had to talk to.
he says you're going out of town.
well, yeah. I told him all about it.
Jesse and I are just going to Mississippi. Business trip.
I've been around long enough to know you're lying to him.
and he knows it too. So what's really going on?
it's about the organization Michael's working to take down. It's classified.
as Michael's mother, I'm very grateful to you for helping him bring them down.
but I'm your friend too, Fiona.
and you keep doing this, you're gonna lose that young man of yours who I think you care very much about.
I know.
if I do this, I risk losing him, and if I don't...
and the mission fails, and we go to prison, I lose him anyway.
then I suggest you get on with your day.
anybody home? - Hey, Sam.
before you say another word, Mike, there's something that I gotta say.
I'm not sure if I want in on this Op.
screwing up an extradition deal run by the MI6, as in the security service of our closest ally?
they're giving a drug smuggler a comfortable retirement.
you read the file, Sam.
Cabral has killed entire families.
they may be our ally, but I'm not gonna lose sleep over this.
okay, but you do remember what the job is, right? Why we're here?
cause it ain't to take down Marco Cabral.
James is the target, Cabral is just a means to an end.
so we're clear on that. - We're clear.
so what's the plan?
Cabral is supposed to have his final sit-down with MI6 at a restaurant in his hotel.
well, can we take him there? - That's the idea, Sam.
the challenge is that James wants this done quietly and we won't have a team.
so a direct grab is out, then.
our best bet is to beat MI6 to the punch and offer Cabral a better deal.
you sure that's gonna fly? 'Cause he's been talking to our friends across the ditch for a year.
why would he jump ship now
well, that's a start.
we'll delay the British team with a fake bomb threat at the embassy.
you'll go in, make the offer, and I'll cover you from the street.
okay, and you'll cover me with...
anything you want. - That's a lot of guns, Mikey.
when operating in third-world countries, a dollar is usually a lot more useful than a bullet.
in a place where the government runs on bribes and connections, you can get a lot done with a nice suit and a bag of cash.
okay, Mike, I'm in place. Any sign of her majesty's secret service?
no. MI6 has not approached the hotel.
the lockdown at the British embassy is working.
good, it sounds like our suspicious package did its trick.
and just so you know, I'm letting your spy friends buy me the good champagne.
you know, just to help sell the cover I. D.
knock yourself out, Sam.
looks like we're good to go. Cabral is right on time.
you got me covered?
Yeah, Sam. I got a view of the entire courtyard.
senor Cabral. Welcome.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
what's going on?
where are the British-- - Oh, your British friends.
well, they've been, um, delayed.
I was hoping we'd have a little chat before they got here.
call Barton.
who are you? And how do you know about-- - About your arrangement with MI6?
well, let's just say I make it my business to know such things. I'll get right to the point.
my name is Charles Finley and I represent a major conglomerate with interest in the Caribbean.
we were told that you're looking for a fresh start, so we'd like to make an offer.
moment.
an offer, you say. - Yes, a very generous offer.
stock options, company housing, a seven-figure retainer per year, and that's just to start.
interesting. Tell me something, Mr. Finley.
what does a consortium like yours want with a man like me?
well, we're moving into this region and we need someone with influence, connections.
someone who isn't afraid to, as they say, get their hands a little bloody.
I've found that blood always washes right off.
see? Now, that's the positive attitude we're looking for.
you make big promises, Mr. Finley.
tell me why I should believe a word you say.
how about a million reasons?
and that's just the signing bonus. That's yours right now if you go with us instead of MI6.
that is very tempting. But you know what's more tempting?
I take your money...
and I go with MI6.
remember, Mr. Finley, I'm not afraid to get my hands bloody.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you, Senor Cabral.
Oh, no? And why not?
you see, you could kill me, but then my sniper would have to kill you.
and that sounds like a bad start to a great business relationship.
well, you've got my number. When you change your mind, you give me a call.
Mike, I don't know how many times I gotta say this, but this mission is a bust.
I mean, I don't know if you were paying attention, but I was down there with a bunch of guns in my face, and Cabral was very clear,
we can't just give up, Sam.
this isn't about giving up, brother, this is about facing reality.
this guy's gonna be on a boat back to jolly old England in, what, eight hours?
which means we have eight hours to change his mind.
how do you propose to do that?
listen, Sam, there's a reason why he took this deal. Cabral has enemies.
he's already survived two assassination attempts. We can use that.
what are you thinking?
well, we know the marina where he's meeting with MI6.
if we can convince him the British can't protect him, our plan will be his only option.
Mike, I don't care how much cool crap those guys got you, we are not attacking two fully-equipped teams.
no attack. Sabotage.
sabotage the British boat, make it look like his political enemies did it.
I got a word for that: Nightmare. - It's either that or failure.
and you know as well as I do this can't fail.
Biloxi, Mississippi
Biloxi General Hospital
welcome to Biloxi. Hope you enjoyed the flight.
Yeah, not so much.
all your secret budgets, you can't spring for a bigger plane?
I've been in bumper cars with more legroom than that thing.
I'll bring it up with Congress. Here's the situation.
officially, our person of interest was transferred here for an outpatient procedure.
we'll do the interrogation in one of the surgery rooms, ship him back.
do we have a name? - You have about 50.
every time he got moved to another institute for the criminally insane he got a new file and a new I. D. For now, he's John Doe.
I'm not liking the "criminally insane" thing. Is he dangerous?
well, we have to assume he is.
he's been in isolation on a double dose of Haldol since as far back as the records go.
we've been stepping him down off the drug since this morning.
you sure that's a good idea? This guy's got a special forces tattoo.
I prefer my trained killers on the sleepy side.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen. We need him cogent and answering questions.
I'll lead the interrogation, but I want you two backing me up.
filling in any blanks with what you know about James.
code gray, code gray. Security to west wing nurse's station. Code gray.
cat scan right away and get him to radiology. - What happened? Where's John Doe?
we were escorting him to the holding room, and somehow he got out of his restraints.
we have to find him now. If he gets out of this hospital...
you need to lock this place down.
the CIA is not officially here. We order a lockdown, we could expose the entire operation.
we're not gonna catch a Special Forces operative with hospital security.
quarantine. - What?
contact the CDC, tell them there's a-- an Anthrax outbreak.
that's the only way to lock this place down.
all right, I'll make the call. You two alert security.
if you need to sabotage a boat, an explosive charge underneath the water line is usually the most efficient way to do it.
the challenge is that normal explosive devices and salt water don't mix.
remote detonators won't transmit underwater, so you need to use a timer.
the components can't get wet, so you need to make sure the device has a waterproof seal.
and once you're done comes the really hard part-- putting the device where you need it.
how we looking, Sam?
well, the MI6 guys are still sweeping the boat.
looks like they're almost done.
you sure you want to do this, Mike? Only got about ten minutes before Cabral shows.
we have to, Sam. It's our last shot.
senor Cabral. You're early. - Everything in order?
just as we discussed, yes. The boat will take you to the Cayman Islands, and from there you'll go by private plane to London.
good. Check the boat.
there's no need for that, Senor Cabral. My men have already checked everything.
senor barton, a dissident put a bomb in my home just a month ago.
another tried to assassinate me in the marketplace just a few days ago.
every second I am on this island my life is in danger.
which is all the more reason why you should depart immediately.
I will. After my men have checked it. Go.
how am I looking, Sam? - Mike, we got a problem.
Cabral's early, and he's sending his guys to the boat-- time to abort.
if we lose Cabral, we lose James.
Mike, pull the plug and get outta there. I could still do this.
Yeah, you know what? That's crazy talk.
you won't have time to plant a bomb and get a safe distance away.
an underwater explosion isn't something you want to be close to, 'cause water doesn't compress under pressure.
a shockwave carries a long distance without losing kinetic energy.
and if you're still within the blast radius when the bomb goes off, that kinetic energy will shatter every bone in your body.
your men checked the boat?
Mike, can you hear me? - You call that clear?
it was clear not ten minutes ago! I don't know what happened.
senor Cabral, unexpected complications are part of any mission.
my men are currently implementing-- - Your men almost got me killed.
we will make other arrangements. - No! There will be no more arrangements.
Mike, what the hell was that? - Did it work?
setting off a charge so close to you, you could've killed yourself.
did it work?
Yeah, Mike. It worked.
well, you're lucky that's the worst of it.
I still think we should check you out for a concussion too.
the blast pushed me into some rocks. I'm fine.
barely. - Got the job done.
maybe. There's still no guarantee that Cabral is gonna call.
meanwhile, you're out there risking your life, and for what?
you know what it's for. The CIA.
Yeah, yeah, they're gonna throw us in a hole if we don't help 'em get this James guy, but you know what?
life in a CIA prison is still better than death face-down in the middle of some God-forsaken marina on some cockamamie mission that
don't get smug.
Finley here. - Senor Finley, this is Marco Cabral.
how nice to hear from you, Mr. Cabral. How are you this lovely afternoon?
circumstances have changed. Your offer-- is it still on the table?
why, yes it is, indeed. Just tell me where you'd like to meet.
Absolutely. As soon as we can.
bought us one more hour of our quarantine, but we gotta wrap this up fast. What do we have?
well, the good news is he hasn't left the building.
we have cameras at every exit, and nothing's come in or out since the lockdown.
have we swept all the floors yet? - Well, that's the bad news.
security's combed every inch, and there's no sign of him.
what, he just disappeared? I mean, where did he go?
hold on, guys, check this out.
third floor security corridor camera picks him up going all the way down the hall.
and then poof. Kills the feed.
the only place he could've gone from there is the roof.
pull Nelson and Jacobs off E. R. - Hang on, hang on.
if this guy's hiding on the roof, why would he wait until he got all the way to the access door to kill the camera?
he's been sedated. He's not thinking straight.
or he wants us to think he's up there.
this guy with Special Forces, he knows how many people we've got.
we start pulling people off of exits, we might be giving him exactly what he wants.
but you know, last time I checked, even Deltas can't turn invisible.
he's gotta be on the roof. We've cleared the building.
there's no place else for him to go.
what about the elevator shaft?
it's right where the camera went down.
son of a bitch.
okay... We're approaching the elevator doors in the basement.
which is also the morgue, by the way--thanks for that.
anytime, Porter.
all right, people, let's look alive.
gotta open these doors at exactly the same time. I don't want this guy getting away.
all right, we're ready. Let's get this done, gentlemen.
one, two, three.
first floor, all clear. - Second floor, clear.
I think I got something.
Ah, it's a false alarm. It's not him.
Hey, Porter, I'm liking my roof idea more and more.
I'm telling you, he's still in the building, man.
how's it looking out there?
no sign of surveillance. We're all set.
Cabral said 2: 00? - Yeah.
uh, the north parking structure, 2: 00.
so I've been checking out this kidnap kit they put together for us--not bad.
I'm thinking we wait till we get out of the city before we gift wrap him.
so what is this? - Halothane. Animal sedative.
it'll keep him out cold until he gets to whatever pit James is throwing him into.
pit, huh?
he's just getting what he deserves. - Hey, I'm not friend to Cabral.
I mean, the guy almost killed me.
I'm just concerned that you're enjoying this a little too much.
enjoying this? I've been working on this job for almost a year, Sam.
that's what I'm worried about.
look, I'm your best friend. I can see that look in your eye.
this guy James-- he's getting to you. They all are.
I know.
that's why I need you here.
I know who James is. I know who Sonya is.
but it's difficult to work so hard to be part of something knowing you have to destroy it.
these people believe in what they're doing.
I'm sorry I'm putting you in this situation, but...
I don't think I can do this alone.
you don't have to, Bud.
all right. Looks like we're in business.
senor Cabral. Right on time.
pleasure to see you again.
I'm so glad we had a second chance to get acquainted.
you brought the money.
Yup, it's here, and it's all yours upon signing the employment agreement.
paperwork's in the car so you can study it in the lap of luxury on the way to the docks.
I'll take it from here, amigo.
it's okay. Is there a problem?
no. No problem. I prefer to take my own car.
we'll follow you to the boat.
if I like what I see, we have a deal.
if I don't like what I see, I have my men.
I understand the need for security.
but a parade of angry guys with guns is just gonna paint a bull's-eye on your forehead.
my men are the best on the island. They can handle any attack.
that's all well and good, but see, we're going to a private marina, so
Mr. Finley... Why are you so anxious to separate me from my men?
okay, whoa, hey. Easy, cowboy.
senor Cabral, we're both businessmen here.
put the weapons away, I'm sure we can handle this without violence.
one of the basic rules of combat is... Kill him.
hit first, and hit hard.
you only get one chance to surprise your enemy.
the important thing is to make it count.
go! Go! Go!
spies are trained extensively on what to do when taken prisoner.
if escape is impossible, the most important thing is to make a connection with your captor.
find out what they want and try to talk your way out of the situation without bloodshed.
Hey, man. My friends are outside. They're gonna be coming in here any minute.
what's that?
I'd be still if I were you.
of course, it's a lot harder to connect with someone who happens to be criminally insane.
this is ethylene oxide and perchloric acid. It's highly explosive.
and that's gonna buy us some privacy.
listen to me, you don't have to do this.
I'm afraid I do.
now I'm gonna ask you some questions, and if I don't like your answers or if I think that you're lying,
I am going to take us to hell together.
can you hear me? We want to negotiate.
just back off or I will kill him!
we're gonna have to breach. - This thing is already out of control.
we start blowing doors off of hinges, our quarantine story is shot.
well, I would rather explain a breached door than a dead body... Or two.
all right, do it.
I'm gonna need a det cord and blasting caps.
now... Is he here?
is who here?
I know who sent you, so what I want to know is he here?
I would love to answer you. I have no idea what you're talking about.
James! Where is James Kendrick?
that's his last name? Kendrick?
well, you just told me more about that guy than we've been able to find out for a month.
what?
I'm working with the CIA.
we're after the head of a terrorist network.
up until about ten seconds ago we only knew him as James.
no, you're lying. - I'm not lying, man.
you're lying. This is another one of his tricks.
see, he sent you to get rid of me, and now that I've turned the tables, you're pretending that you don't know him.
buddy, you got a bomb around my neck. I'm not trying to trick you.
I don't work for James Kendrick.
I'm here to help you.
you wanna let me in on the joke?
do you want to know why I've been rotting in a mental institution for the past 15 years?
because that bastard put me there.
when he finds out that you
wait, wait, wait, don't move! No, no, no, no, no!
no, everybody, wait! Wait!
we're all on the same team here. - Back off, or everybody dies.
Jesse, you have an improvised explosive on your chest and he has the trigger.
how are you on the same team?
listen to me. He's the victim here.
I don't think she believes you. - Oh, she does because she trusts me.
and she's my friend.
she's gonna put the gun down right now.
what about him? - That's the CIA agent I was telling you about.
wouldn't exactly call him a friend, but...
I guarantee you this, he wants to take down James just as much as you do.
he's right. I can help you.
whatever James did to you-- - He took my life away.
you help me...
and I'll do everything I can to give it back to you.
I promise.
how's Cabral doing back there?
Ah, he's sleeping like a heavily-sedated evil baby.
how much further to the rendezvous? - A few miles.
James is meeting us at a commercial marina outside Santo Domingo.
extracting a high-value target from a foreign country is a challenge even under ideal conditions.
if the capture of the target left witnesses and raised alarms, it's even harder.
the problem is that high-value targets tend to have a lot of friends and allies.
they can alert local authorities, set up search parties,
and if you're really unlucky, they can bring out some big guns of their own.
what the hell's going on up there?
Aw, crap. Looks like Cabral's DCA guys.
get out of the car, hands up!
look, can we just hightail it outta here?
no, that . 50 Cal would shred us before we even turned around.
turn off the car and come out with your hands in the air.
well, it was fun while it lasted.
Sam, wait.
wait. Wait for what? For them to kill us?
they're too far away to see into the car. There might be a way out.
what size shirt do you think he wears?
I repeat.
turn off the car and come out with your hands in the air.
okay, Mike, you got 50 feet to cover.
your hands are tied, you're wearing a head bag.
you feeling lucky?
I'll take that as a yes.
I'm sorry...
my Spanish is...
very bad.
you can have Cabral if you let me pass.
everybody wins.
OK.
send out Senor Cabral!
okay.
here he is.
good luck, brother.
walk!
try anything...
I'll kill him.
one of the oldest tricks in espionage is the false surrender of a prisoner.
it's a desperate move used only when you're completely outmanned and outgunned.
it means approaching your enemy alone and unarmed.
it's not ideal.
but it will get you close enough to attack.
kill him!
shoot him!
gotta say, Mike.
don't always enjoy these little tropical vacations, but they're never dull.
it is a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Axe. I've heard good things.
Yeah. Right back at you.
it was good work today.
the DR loses a murderer.
and we gain access to the largest private intelligence network in the Caribbean.
nice boat, James. A little small to fit all of us and the box.
Yes. Yes, it is.
you two won't be coming with. Tickets under these names.
safe travels, both of you.
James, I know Cabral's file backwards and forwards.
whatever you have planned for him, I can help. Take us with you.
I admire your enthusiasm, Michael.
your part in this-- it's over.
now you've proven yourself to be everything I could've hoped for and more.
go home. Get some rest. You earned it.
well, you heard the man. Let's go home.
Hey, look who's home. - Awful vacation.
you have been busy.
Yeah, with a little help from Porter and Glenanne.
you read the new file on James? - Very impressive service record.
Yeah, no kidding. Delta Force.
gotta love having our elite military training turned against us.
do we know why he went off the rails? - No. That's why you're here.
this new asset is a Delta too. Peter Millard.
same unit, disappeared at the same time.
millard refuses to tell us any more, says he wants to talk to the guy that was undercover with Kendrick.
Why? - Why don't you ask him yourself?
you the guy who's working with James?
no, I'm the one working to stop him.
what makes you think you can do that?
because I'm willing to do whatever it takes, go as far as I have to go.
as far as you have to go?
tell me, do you know how far James is willing to go?
I'm starting to. - I doubt it.
what do you know about Mogadishu? - I know you and James served together there.
according to the report, your unit was wiped out protecting a village.
he was presumed KIA, and so were you. - Is that what the report says?
why don't you tell me what really happened, then?
my unit was sent to take out a warlord outside Mogadishu.
turned out the intelligence was bad.
the warlord was a kid wannabe with a few rifles and some punk friends.
the camp was a village full of women and children. We radioed in.
guess some suit up the line didn't want a blotch on his record. Orders came down.
wipe 'em out anyway.
a lot of guys didn't like it, but orders were orders. I couldn't do it.
James was my best friend in the unit. I asked him to talk them out of it, he said he'd try.
but it didn't work? - No.
they wouldn't disobey a direct order.
I told him we had to do something, he said he'd handle it, and I thought...
God, I don't know what I thought.
what did you do?
Peter, if I'm gonna help you, I need to know what I'm facing. What did he do?
he killed them all.
the whole unit.
slit their throats while they were sleeping.
you think you can stop him? No one can stop him.
I tried. He put me away.
buried. 15 years.
I loved that man.
would've followed him anywhere.
and he led me straight to hell.
exterminator found him.
setting traps at the neighbor's house.
that's when he saw it. - "It?
is it an "it" or a "him?
it's kind of both.
rat guy said he thought it was a soccer ball or a pumpkin.
that's not a soccer ball. - Or a pumpkin.
you canvass the neighborhood?
knocked on doors, but guess what?
no one saw anything.
Oh, it's not just the head. He's still in one piece.
body's buried underneath him.
looks like he's been dead about a day.
flower petals. Dianthus.
I happen to know flowers.
you ever see one like this before?
you mean made out of a man?
someone made him into a flower.
and left him here on this lawn.
you send flowers, it usually means one of two things.
you're really in love, or you're really sorry.
which one is it?
diabetic. Frank Dunlop.
Frank took a bullet to his chest at close range before he was buried.
you get some real perspective when your head is down here.
is that-- is that Frank's dinner?
label has yesterday's date.
Salisbury steak, peas, and apple brown betty?
Oh, diabetics shouldn't eat apple brown betty.
Beverly hills cares?
let's see if it's true.
Frank was our best driver.
totally committed to others, never missed a day of work.
he was a saint.
can we get a list of his deliveries?
sure.
Frank lived for this place.
always looking to make it better.
um, last week he found a way to raise a ton of money for it.
he say how?
no, but he wasn't just a talker.
if he said that he had a way, he had a way.
he ever mention any problems with his deliveries?
he never complained.
and he was the one who ran food to all the crazies.
the crazies?
like sketchy people, troublemakers.
Frank actually seemed to like them.
any live near north valley circle?
I got...
two on Vista Vierra.
that's near valley circle, right?
I got a Flint Garber on 1818 Vista Vierra, and a Maude Paxton on...
1818 Vista Vierra.
yes?
are you Maude Paxton?
I am, have you brought the food?
no, we haven't.
actually, we're here about the person who brings the food. May we come in?
of course.
has something happened to Frank?
where the hell's my food?
flint Garber. - Who are you?
how do you know my name? Did you bring my food?
they know your name?
flint, they're here about Frank.
I'm detective Reese, and this is detective Crews.
you just let anybody in the house.
we'd like to ask you some, uh-- we'd like to talk to you about Frank Dunlop.
well, Frank didn't show up today.
does that mean I don't get my food?
when was the last time you saw Frank?
the day before yesterday.
he comes every day.
you'd never met a sweeter soul than Frank.
can we ask where you were last night?
you can ask. Free country.
he was here. He's always here.
always? You never leave?
can't. Nobody steal my stuff. Valuable stuff.
and Maude, where were you last night?
here too. We were watching the TV.
it was my turn with the remote.
Oh, we're roommates. - Yeah, just roommates.
so now look, if you don't have any food for me, you just get the hell off my property.
the two roommates Flint Garber and Maude Paxton are both clean slates;
no rap sheets on either.
Frank Dunlop's clean too. Not even a parking ticket.
maybe this guy really was a saint.
only one saint walked this earth. - Who's that?
my mother. - His mother.
I searched the vi-cap database.
the last murder listed with dianthus on the victim was in... um
the 70s. Johnny Hazlit.
weird cult, the Hazlits.
killed ten people, never got convicted.
Hazlit overdosed on drugs in 1972.
what about the rest of the Hazlits?
the ones we can trace are either in prison or dead.
but a lot of them just went underground and disappeared.
okay. No leaks, no press.
if the press hears that the Hazlits are still out there, or there's a copycat, all hell breaks loose and we'll never solve this.
get online and get me everything you can about Hazlit.
there won't be a lot in the database from back then. It's ancient history.
well, okay, you two are off to LAPD dead record storage.
why go there when we can go somewhere where history comes alive?
Los Angeles museum of murder and mayhem.
Lamomam.
people actually pay to see this?
maybe we don't see the value because we get it for free.
and you knew about this place because...
came here on a date once.
it was her idea.
guitar said to have been given to Johnny Hazlit by Donovan in 1968.
they called him "mellow yellow."
Johnny Hazlit's personal teddy bear.
I'm the one who acquired that piece from a collector in japan.
can we help you with something?
are you the owners?
Yes, I'm Squeaky. This is Tex.
we met at a ted Bundy auction.
he outbid me. - but she seduced me.
I paid for the guitar.
how much of this stuff is real?
we're very precise about the provenance of everything here.
Provenance? - Yes, an object's place of origin.
proof that it is what it is.
any of the "its" here a 0 . 45 caliber handgun?
no. Famous murder guns are too expensive for us.
they start around 10, 000 and go up from there.
$10, 000 for a gun?
well, a gun that killed somebody. - Provenance.
mass murder memorabilia is a huge and growing market.
sadly, very little comes on the market.
most collectors are private.
japanese eat it up.
but they keep their collections to themselves.
we'd like to look at your archives.
because you're homicide detectives?
he's Charlie Crews.
two murders short of making the mass murder room.
we have a minimum of five.
actually, I was five murders short.
she means before you were innocent.
or before we knew you were innocent.
of course, there's talk of what you did in prison.
there's talk about a lot of things.
ever see this guy before?
uh, no. Is he a murder victim?
you're homicide detectives. Asked about the gun.
feel free to look around for a while.
we are a museum. We want you to look.
Hazlit used dianthus to decorate his kills, but he never buried any of them.
all his victims were shot with a 0. 45 like Frank Dunlop.
Hazlit's 0. 45 was never found.
and Hazlit's dead, so copycat.
you ever hear of a copycat killing 30 years after the original?
people are still pretty into this.
some more than others.
all right, let's get alibis on Tex and Squeaky.
they did ask us to look.
Oh, look at this.
looks like Hazlit had a bunch of kids with different women.
they would ended up in social services after the arrests.
some of them may still be around.
wanna see if any of them went into the family business?
eight wives, 43 children.
eight wives all at the same time?
that's like 1, 000 pounds of wife in the house. No wonder Hazlit was crazy.
I always thought I'd have a lot of kids.
house full of noise. Chaos.
what about you, detective Reese?
I don't think it's a good idea for me to have children.
why is that?
because it wouldn't be.
me? I'd like two kids. - Well, good luck with that.
according to these files we got from social services, the kids that were taken from Hazlit in 1972 were given their mother's last name.
makes sense. You wouldn't want "Hazlit" on the back of your hockey jersey.
one of those mother's names was Garber.
her son is Flint Garber ... Hazlit.
let me guess. Another mother's last name was Paxton?
her daughter's name was Maude Paxton ... Hazlit.
Johnny Hazlit had two kids living a chip shot from the murder?
I guess you figured out who our pappy was.
Maude, where's flint? - He's inside.
he's got a gun, but it isn't loaded, so don't shoot him.
don't you steal my stuff.
we're not here for your stuff, Flint.
we're here for you.
the last time we were here, you didn't say you were Hazlits.
you didn't ask if we were Hazlits. Last time you were here.
it's not the kind of thing we advertise.
word gets out, townsfolk start lighting the torches.
Frank Dunlop know who you were?
does Frank know we grew up surrounded by death covered in blood?
no, we don't speak about it.
Frank was the...
was the kind of guy you could talk to. He was uh...
he was a real good listener.
Frank is the only one I ever talked to about us being -- us.
there are three bedrooms being used in this house.
if one of them is yours, Maude, and the other one is Flint's, then who sleeps in the other bedroom?
Clifton. My son.
not my son. Clifton is my nephew.
Where's Clifton today?
he hasn't been around since Monday.
you know where we can find him?
if Frank is the only person you ever talked to about it... Flint?
does your son know he's a Hazlit?
he'd use it against me. The way I grew up.
you're not gonna tell Clifton about this, are you?
well, now we have three Hazlits living just a chip shot away from Frank's murder.
detectives. Got a gun here.
got another one over here. And a knife; dried blood on it.
that's just junk I collected over the years.
I mean, I couldn't killed Frank. I never leave this house.
we were watching TV that night.
okay. Well, we're just gonna ask you to come along with us.
run some tests on those weapons.
if you'd like to just stand up for us, please, and put your hands behind your backs.
is that really necessary?
Oh, alrighty.
once I saw pappy kill a man while he was handcuffed.
strangled him with the chain.
said it was proof of the master-slave relationship.
a victim was found shot at a foreclosed house, that's all I can tell you.
Johnny Hazlit? Didn't he play for the dodgers?
Oh, must be a different one. Never heard of him.
the press are all over us.
they know about the victim being buried up to his neck?
only us and the killer have that detail. you giving interviews?
no, but-- - but what, my good detectives?
Lamomam? - Lamomam. You drive.
you wanna step away from the car?
it's my car. Why would I wanna step away from it?
cause she asked you to.
you know Frank Dunlop?
Frankie meals on wheels? Why?
because your father and aunt have just been arrested in connection with his murder.
my father never leaves the house.
and my aunt, she's-- she's practically Mrs. Butterworth.
wait, someone-- someone killed Frankie Dunlop?
do you always keep your car so clean, Clifton?
shampooing the trunk?
Yeah, it took every penny that I have.
so I like to take care of it.
took every penny you have?
is that why you're living at home?
no, it's how every 23-year-old wants to roll.
how come you think that my dad and aunt are involved?
we found guns at the house.
Yeah. My dad's got a lot of junk.
but like I said, he doesn't go out.
you mind if we take a sample from this carpet back there?
Yeah, I do. A lot.
might depreciate the value.
your dad seemed to like Frank.
guess so.
the way he talked about him, guess he thought of Frank kind of as a son.
but you're his son, so...
where you been these last few days?
you wanna give us her name?
not really.
Reese, you wanna tell Clifton about the family plan we have at lockup?
you're dating Clifton Garber?
for about a year.
why didn't you tell us last time we were here?
something you're protecting Clifton from?
he and Frank didn't get along.
Frank was very sweet, and Clifton didn't believe anybody could be that sweet.
it made Clifton so mad.
Mindy, did Clifton ever mention his father? Or his aunt?
Where's your partner Squeaky, Tex?
at an auction. - You talk to the press?
the press? About the Hazlit killing? Nuh-uh. No, sir.
if you did, you'd be getting in the way of my investigation.
you know, not everyone thinks he's innocent.
excuse me? - Your old partner. Check the websites.
a lot of people out there still think he killed that family.
about a year ago, Clifton came in to sign his dad and aunt up for the program.
his dad's some kind of a shut-in, and his aunt forgets things.
like to shop and stuff.
so Clifton arranged for meals to be delivered to the house.
to make sure that they had food.
in case he was working and didn't get home to feed them.
I think that Clifton hated Frank because Clifton's afraid of his own sweetness.
and Clifton was with you?
and you're not afraid of his sweetness?
no, not at all. Why should I be?
we have a few empty display cases in there for your old partner if it turns out, you know, he did do that family.
we're gonna go now, Tex. You remember what I said.
Hey, anything of Crews's you'd be willing to sell me?
uh, some shoes? Or a used coffee cup? Just in case?
you gonna talk to ray born?
said he's got something to tell me.
that FBI agent said you go after ray born, you go back to jail.
well, that's just the way they talk.
I couldn't go back to jail.
no one is going back to jail, Ted.
it's a wedding invitation.
to your father's wedding.
putting aside the fact that you say you're in love with the woman who is going to marry my father,
I have not said a word to my dad in 12 years.
I'm not going to his wedding. Why would you wanna go?
I do love her, Charlie.
Ted, she is marrying my father.
you know? It might be easier to think of who set me up for those murders than you and...
you know how small a cancer cell is?
very small?
think about all the ass you've kicked in your life, and in the end,
I'm gonna get cored out like an apple by something I can't even take a swing at.
you know, I think you're the reason I went to jail.
because you saw a photo.
you know, I think you're the reason my friends were murdered.
so I guess I'm not exactly sure why you think I care you're dying.
well, for one thing, you might save yourself a bullet, and for another, when I'm dead, I'm dead.
I know your secret, detective.
well, that's good to hear. Cause as it turns out, I don't know my secret.
all those words help keep the dark thoughts away?
your secret is you want to come out of the dark, but you can't.
you want to leave behind the blood, but you can't.
you want to let go of revenge, but you can't.
how do you know that?
I know that because I know that.
see? I also have words, detective.
and I also have photos.
you know this guy?
can't place him.
Yeah, okay.
you see that look on his face, that smug fed smile.
he works for the FBI. Maybe you knew that.
I thought you said you had photos.
well, special agent bonder, here, works for the FBI.
he does a little moonlighting, though.
he works for someone else too.
yeah? Who's that?
Roman Nabokov. I know you know him.
I know you wanted him.
and I know that bonder took him away.
bodner works for Roman.
was the Dunlop killing a Hazlit copycat?
we're pursuing all leads.
wow, looks like the leak got bigger.
bet their business is booming.
at this point in time, I would ask for your patience and allow us to do our job. Thank you.
you fail to mention the victim was found buried up to his neck, or that there were flowers found scattered around the body, just like Johnny Hazlit used to do it.
Yes, I failed to mention that.
you failed to mention that the victim was found near the home of Flint Garber, 1818 Vista Vierra.
Yeah, failed to mention that. Also failed to mention something else.
what's that? - You're under arrest.
Yeah, okay. One more thing:
flint Garber and Maude Paxton were the children of Johnny Hazlit.
there's a grandson too, Clifton.
a house full of Hazlits around the block from the murder.
come on, that's enough.
that Frank Dunlop's body was buried up to the neck is a detail that didn't go to the press.
we keep certain facts to ourselves.
then the only people who know those facts are us cops, or the killer.
come on, lap leaks like a sieve.
where do you think we get most of our information from?
maybe it was a tribute murder.
or a copycat. There's a difference.
it's subtle, but it's there.
you should teach a class.
Hey, maybe we could get your partner to give a guest lecture.
what do you think, Squeaky, should we do it?
actually, I do know the difference between copycat and tribute.
detail I picked up at lamomam.
let me see if I get this right.
Hazlit left flowers by his kills.
now, if Frank Dunlop's body had had flowers surrounding it, - that would been a copycat, yes? - Yes.
but Frank Dunlop's body the way it was found?
it was a flower that someone left for Hazlit, and that's a tribute.
okay, Hazlit didn't like people who lied or broke promises to him.
Frank Dunlop ever break any promises to you?
we didn't know Frank Dunlop.
we just find Hazlit fascinating.
like the rest of the world. Like you two.
well, we'll be less fascinated once we find Frank Dunlop's killer.
maybe you won't be able to.
maybe you'll always find him fascinating.
Oh, like a song you can't get out of your head?
Yeah, man. Like that.
do you have alibis for the night Frank Dunlop was killed?
at an auction for hillside strangler items.
we were both there.
are we suspects now?
do you wanna be?
that'll be good for ticket sales.
we'll check out your alibi.
if it all pans out, you get to go home.
take your time.
auction house employees saw Squeaky and Tex that night.
but it was, in their words, "a mob scene for all that hillside strangler swag."
I'm not sure I understand a world where that stuff sells at auctions.
well, they got what they wanted. Publicity.
Bobby! - On it!
coming through! Move it! Move!
I always wanted to know what a Hazlit tasted like.
meet Clifton Hazlit, Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
come on. Make a lane! Make a lane! Make a lane!
I look just like Hazlit, don't I?
all my life, I thought there was something wrong with me.
turns out there is.
the man you hit isn't gonna press charges.
they exposed me, what happens to them?
I should done what my grandfather would've.
what's that?
made them pay in blood.
Clifton? You're no different than you were before you found out.
Oh, I'm different. You heard her.
now I'm Johnny Hazlit's grandson.
all right, well, you know, we can let you out the back.
why the back?
because those photographers, they're waiting for you out front.
Hello? - Who is this?
this is Charles Crews. Who is this?
I was looking for Olivia.
I thought I dialed her cell phone.
you dialed the house.
she's out trying on her wedding dress for the 10, 000th time.
you want me to leave her a message for you?
uh, tell her... somebody called.
somebody? What the
somebody? Somebody called?
Oh, great.
red light? Did I run it?
license and registration.
you know why we pulled you over, Mr. Earley?
I blew through that light.
I'm gonna run these.
gun!
show me your hands!
out of the car.
on your knees.
I'm sorry, I have a friend on the force.
on your knees.
found this next to the gun.
that is not mine. Not the gun, not whatever's in that baggie.
Oh, guys. Guys, please. I'm--I'm on parole.
Maude Paxton-Hazlit and Flint Garber-Hazlit alibi each other.
so they both did it, or they both didn't do it?
what about the guns found out at the house?
none of them match the bullets found in Frank Dunlop.
we're running 'Them down to see if they match up to any other crimes.
squeaky and Tex?
they alibi each other too.
so they both did it or they both didn't do it.
what about the grandson, young Clifton?
he was with his girlfriend.
or maybe not.
Mindy! Is it true you're in a relationship with Clifton Garber?
that is not true.
didn't you tell the police you were in a relationship with Johnny Hazlit's grandson?
no.
your father?
he get you to say what you did to those reporters?
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.
you're withdrawing your statement?
a man was killed, Mindy. A man you knew.
what did you call him? A saint?
Clifton asked me to cover for him and I did.
we weren't having a relationship.
I only knew him from the food bank.
I wasn't having a relationship with Clifton Garber.
it was a mistake and I'm sorry.
wow, what do you think, detective Crews?
I think that's a nice speech.
did you write it, or did your dad?
I have to go now.
you like Clifton?
cause he's not from your world.
he's not your dad over there.
he drives for people like your dad.
Mindy, are you recanting because you really weren't with Clifton?
or is it because it turns out the man you were with is a Hazlit?
I wasn't with Clifton.
you're looking at obstruction of justice.
do you understand that?
my father said his lawyers will call you about that. I have to go.
do you believe her? - Nope.
her dad finds out his daughter is linked to a Hazlit, and Clifton Garber loses his alibi.
Yeah.
it's a weird thing to hold against somebody.
what? - Their blood.
Yep. We'll be right there.
Lamomam, shots fired.
is he dead, is Tex dead?
did you see who it was?
Yeah. I did. He was here.
who was here?
Hazlit. It was Johnny Hazlit.
I heard the gun and I turned.
Tex was on the ground.
and then I saw him.
you saw Johnny Hazlit with the gun?
I saw the gun.
it looked bigger in his hands, bu--but it was his hand.
it was Johnny Hazlit.
he shot Tex, and then he shot me, and then he dropped the gun and ran.
Squeaky, sometimes when you see a gun like that, that's all you see.
it confuses everything else.
I wasn't confused. It was Johnny.
he was here. I saw him.
but he ran.
well, we know Johnny Hazlit didn't do it.
cause he's dead?
let's get some gunshot residue tests done on Squeaky and Tex hurry.
Yeah. Only one of them is dead, but both of them are crazy.
maybe she did see Johnny Hazlit.
that would be the crazy part.
what if you found out there was something in your blood that you didn't know was there?
the guy I hit? That museum freak.
that's right. The museum that exposed you as a Hazlit.
you think I killed that grebe.
like you said, it's what your grandfather would done.
you have good reason.
yeah? I also have an alibi.
I been here all night.
and so have they.
and they're not gonna recant like Mindy.
Yeah! All right.
Nope, they like me for who I am.
Yeah. Everywhere I go, they go.
wanna take a picture with me?
no? Okay.
you live in this limo cause you don't wanna go home.
I'd rather never step foot back in that house again.
but you can't afford anywhere else.
that's right. - Because this limo took all your cash.
which is why you moved home in the first place.
Yeah. Limo took all my cash.
so if you don't have any money, who pays the mortgage on that house?
dad, I guess.
with what? Did flint ever have a job?
dad never worked a day in his life.
gunshot residue test on Squeaky and Tex came back negative.
Thanks, Bobby.
you don't work. We checked.
you don't collect social security.
would've had to use your real name for that?
so how do you pay the mortgage, Flint?
and the utilities?
you sell some of your stuff?
it's valuable stuff. It's my legacy.
it all belonged to Johnny Hazlit.
that's right. - Who bought it?
collectors overseas.
do you know Squeaky and Tex Uhry?
they made me a couple of lowball offers.
didn't have any cash.
they couldn't match those foreign offers.
did Frank know the hurry's?
I told him not to sell to them.
go for that foreign money.
why would Frank sell anything? It's all your stuff.
Mindy said Frank told her he found a way to raise a lot of money.
flint, did you give anything to Frank?
all of it.
so he could sell it?
Frank would just used it for charity.
Frank listened to me.
and he said that he could do good things with that money.
and that...
and that would make you good.
but I told him to stick with the foreign buyers.
detectives.
that's the gun found at the museum.
Yeah, the one that shot Squeaky and Tex.
ballistics confirmed that.
and that gun there matches the slugs pulled from Frank Dunlop.
what?
we pulled some prints off the grip. We got a match.
guess who.
but he's been dead for over 30 years.
provenance.
Hazlit's back!!
we're sorry for your loss.
Tex would've wanted this.
why'd you kill Frank Dunlop?
I didn't kill Frank Dunlop.
Frank was told not to sell to you.
all that sweet Hazlit swag going overseas where they get a better price.
is that why you killed him?
then making him look like this?
that's just good for business.
it really paid off.
Tex and I were at that auction.
you know, that auction was so crowded, you and Tex could've left, and no one would've even noticed.
that's what we call a "soft alibi."
why'd you kill Tex, Squeaky?
I didn't kill Tex.
he get nervous about that "soft alibi" ?
I don't know who killed Frank Dunlop.
but Johnny Hazlit killed Tex.
he was here, I saw him.
Johnny Hazlit is dead.
it says so right on that exhibit.
the person who owned Hazlit's gun, that's who killed Tex.
tracked the money order of yours, Squeaky.
$15, 000 last month to japan.
you know, that's a lot of money to spend on a gun.
but I guess you have to spend money to make money.
checked your bank. That was every last penny you had.
you owned that gun. Why didn't you exhibit it?
cause you were using it.
what's that word, Crews? - Provenance.
that was Hazlit. He was here, I saw him!
that gun has his prints!
guess she's working on her insanity defense.
maybe it was Hazlit back from the dead.
or maybe Squeaky and Tex were wearing gloves.
if those gloves were part of the murder, you'd have to put them on display.
because she knew they were real. - Crews?
Charlie! - Let's get outtalk here.
Yeah. Let's get out here.
you run a lean operation here.
plenty of fresh produce, though, foundation of any good meal.
Where's Rachel? Your niece?
she's not my niece.
I know who that girl is, detective.
she went out. Some musician-type called on her. Not my type.
I wouldn't let him near my daughters.
Where's Ted? - Ted.
we'll get to that in a moment.
what did Mickey Rayborn say to you?
that's between me and him.
I thought that'd be your answer.
detective, what did I tell you would happen if you went after ray born?
I told you you'd go back to jail.
but I'm not in jail.
you'll get to Ted in a moment?
I'd like that moment to be now.
we did some thinking back at our thinking room, and on reflection, threatening you with jail might not be that much of a threat.
you wanna try this?
I'm good. - You sure?
I got it right where I want it.
Where's ted?
probably still out at county.
but I'd say he'd be at supermax by noon tomorrow.
you can't drive around with a gun and coke.
you know ted can't hack another stretch.
you went after ray born, and you got in.
now you gonna stay in and do what we tell you.
you make sure that stay at a simmer, and run a spoon through it every once in a while.
did you leave the door open? Call the police!
is that the guy who broke into your house?
arrests were made...
Yeah, that's him.
I just want a chance
I don't want to know you.
fathers were confronted...
who's sister Mary Bernard?
you do not want to start a war with me.
bring it on.
boundaries were drawn...
Mr. Williams was responsible for your husband's death.
and everyone learned that sometimes justice is served...
we need to call an ambulance.
without sang a word.
there were many ways to tell Bree Van De Kamp was a lady.
thank you very much.
she was courteous to those around her, she moved with elegance and grace and she was very careful to never let others know what she was thinking.
Mrs. Van De Kamp, thank you for coming on such short notice.
so what's happened?
have you had any luck finding George?
you see, like most well-bred women...
george is dead.
he committed suicide last night at a hotel.
Bree had something to hide.
Oh, um...
well, um, it was very good of you to tell me in person, truly.
actually, uh, there's more.
more?
do you recognize this?
those are my panties. How did you...
we assume Mr. Williams stole them.
where did you find them?
Mr. Williams had a room filled with, um... unsavory items.
it was like a shrine.
unsavory items? Well, what does that mean?
you don't want to know.
just so you're aware, the daily tribuneis is starting to sniff around this story.
the editor's a good friend of mine.
I'm pretty sure I can quash it, but you might want to tell your family what's going on, just in case.
what is that?
I am so sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.
Mudge, get that out of here.
no, wait! Is that supposed to be me?
well...
it's hard to say.
I don't understand.
I mean, what would George be doing with a life-size doll?
Oh, dear lord.
go ahead.
Oh, hold it. What are you gonna do with that?
well, until we close the file on Mr. Williams, she's considered evidence.
we'll have to take her back to the station.
I am so sorry about this, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I know how difficult all this must be.
don't you worry about me, Detective Barton.
I will be just fine.
Yes, there were many ways to tell that Bree was a lady, but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity in even the most undignified of situations.
it's a story as old as time itself...
the return of the prodigal son.
and no matter how many times it's repeated...
or how the details might vary...
or how the names might change...
the story always ends the same way...
in the tender embrace of a loving father.
Hi, dad.
Susan Mayer told me she gave you some money to go to Utah.
Yeah, I had no idea where to look for you, though, and the money started to run out, so I thought that maybe you'd come back here.
you're a smart kid.
can I ask you something?
of course. Anything.
well, when you left town, Mrs. Tillman said that my real mother was a junkie from Utah.
that's right.
so...
who's my dad?
I don't know. It could have been anyone.
thanks for the faucet. This leak is driving me crazy.
what do I owe you?
Oh, it's no rush. Just pay me when I install it.
Hey, there!
have you seen today's paper?
no, not yet.
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that guy you caught last week.
police seek help in identifying mystery vagrant.
they don't know the man's name yet?
they're not even sure that he knows how talk.
think they're going to hold him in the psych ward until they figure out who he is.
well, I will certainly rest easier knowing that he's not roaming around our neighborhood.
see you!
thanks again for the faucet.
sure.
what are we gonna do about Caleb?
obviously, we are going to go and get him.
where are my cuffs?
bottom drawer. Ah.
so when do I tell people you'll be back?
couple, maybe three days.
what the hell's this?
it's the ball gag. I thought you wanted it.
we do not recycle ball gags.
take a look at the teeth marks.
it's gross.
Hey, Monroe?
you sure you don't want any help?
the guy's dangerous.
he's a half-wit, Jerry.
if I can handle you, I can handle him.
so he poisoned Rex?
sweet, little George Williams.
well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all.
anyway, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so I wanted you to hear it from me first.
Bree, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, like you haven't been through enough.
God, and he's our pharmacist.
it's enough to turn you holistic.
I know this sounds awful, but I'm kind of glad the guy's dead.
Oh, I hope that little creep suffered.
well, we'll never know.
that's Andrew back from camp Hennessey. I've got to go.
does he know yet?
he hasn't got a clue.
how do you think he's gonna react?
all right, what the hell is going on?
I know you didn't take me out of kid jail for my health.
I'll get back to you later.
so are the police sure?
Yeah. They found data in George's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
did they say why he killed him?
well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so...
he could marry me.
honey, please use your coaster.
that's gonna leave a ring.
my father was murdered because of you, so as far as I'm concerned, you no longer get to tell me what to do.
Andrew, that is not fair.
you brought that psycho into our house!
you sat him down at our table.
just how fair do you expect me to be?
Andrew, George Williams fooled a lot of people.
Yeah, well, he didn't fool me.
Andrew, I'm not trying to minimize my part in this.
believe me, I hate myself for what's happened.
good. Now we have something in common.
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna call my friend Justin and have him come over and spend the night tonight.
Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church?
what kind of friend is he?
the real good kind.
Andrew, it is inappropriate of you to have somebody over.
you just got home.
like I said, you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.
you came.
did I have a choice?
well, sure.
because at the hospital, you sounded like you were fully prepared to blackmail me into having some kind of a relationship with you.
that was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that I am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail.
well, I wish you'd made that clear in the hospital.
could have saved me a trip.
so are you coming in?
well, I got a lunch hour to kill.
that was my first Halloween. I was 2. What do you think I am?
I don't know.
Oh, come on, just guess. You can tell.
uh, a holess person?
no, Addison, I'm a chicken.
see? Those are feathers hanging aroud.
Oh. I thought that was supposed to be trash.
uh, look, are we done here?
you haven't even finished your coffee.
I got to get back to work.
Oh, well, we... we haven't even finished the high school years.
I wanted to show you this one.
this was from the father-daughter dance.
I had to take my mother's hairstylist.
what do you want from me, Susan?
well, l - I just want to share more than our D. N.A.
I... I wanted to have a relationship with you.
none of this means anything to you?
I'll take the hobo picture.
actually, it was... fine.
what's this?
our company insurance policy. You ever bother to read it?
I'm going to say no, but don't tell.
we have day care, Ed, day care.
do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and I have barely left the building?
my kids are forgetting who I am.
I hear you. I have 17-month-old who I haven't actually seen awake in weeks.
see? All we need is a minimum participation of...16 kids.
my kids, your baby, Sally in accounting has three, that new guy in human resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the mormon reptionist.
she just popped out number 6. There. 16.
15. My wife won't do it.
well, maybe if I talk to her.
no, I'm telling you, this day care thing is a non-starter.
fran won't even let anyone else hold the baby.
well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?
Lynette, if I hadn't cut that umbilical cord I swear they would still be attached.
but if you want to try...
more power to you.
you! What the hell did you do with my husband?!
please restrain yourself, Gabrielle.
you're in a house of god.
tell me where he is!
everywhere, of course.
not god, my husband.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
you were supposed to meet me at the spa.
I was just helping sister Mary with the mailings for the fund-raiser.
the church is about to send a relief team to Botswana to help with the drought.
that's your excuse?
we missed side-by-side water massages.
I had to book them weeks in advance.
okay, you missed a massage.
it's unfortunate, but there are people dying in Botswana.
there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
what is your problem?
sister Mary, will you excuse us, please?
certainly.
we are supposed to be working on our marriage, Carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans.
you're blaming sister Mary for the tension in our marriage?
she wants us fighting.
she wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
that's crazy. She's a nun.
she may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and I know what I'm capable of.
she is a woman...
but she is nothing like you.
Carlos, where are you going?
you look tense, Gabrielle.
perhaps you should think about getting a massage.
Hi, Susan, it's Addison. Are you there?
Hi. Hi, yeah, I'm here.
good. You're home.
Uh-huh. What's up?
you know you were saying you wanted to be part of my life?
Yeah.
I'at the police station.
I need you to come bail me out.
solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?
it was entrapment. I'm the victim here.
but you were with a prostitute.
apparently not.
I asked her three times... "are you a cop?"
they got to tell you, but she didn't say "boo."
I thought this was America!
Addison, you just got caught paying for sex.
now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag.
don't give me that look. It wasn't my fault. I'm sorry.
how is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
I was at the store, I was working on my computer and then, you know, they have these ads?
they pop up on the screen and they ask if you want to have a hot date.
well, it gets a fellow worked up.
can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
she's a 68-year-old woman.
that bell stopped ringing for me years ago.
Oh, my god. Stop. Right now.
I'm gonna go pay this thing.
so am I off the hook now?
what?
th whole father-daughter thing, we're done, right?
thursday, coffee at 2. Be on time.
don't take this the wrong way, but are you dim?
okay, I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge.
I bring the coffee.
that crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.
this is Tunde.
he lost both his parents to this drought.
in fact, water is always scarce in Botswana.
the national currency is called the pula or raindrop...
Hello, Gabrielle. What brings you here?
I'm concerned about the drought in Kenya.
botswana.
Yeah, and you?
well, I'm organizing this relief trip.
we leave in a week.
well, bon voyage, father.
I'm not going myself.
we had to scale back our relief efforts this year.
we even had to cut a few of the aid workers from the trip.
sister Mary, sister Greta were so disappointed.
if you just want to hand some of...
sister Mary was going on the trip?
well, sister Mary always goes for at least a few months, but when our funding came up short, she graciously offered to step aside, said there's plenty of god's work to do here.
thank you, Carlos. Appreciate it.
I bet she did.
how much cash are you short, father?
we plan to set up a modern system of irrigation.
I'm sorry to interrupt, sister Mary, but I have an announcement.
I have just received a donation of $8, 000, which means that sister Mary and sister Greta will be able to join our relief trip to Botswana.
it just goes to show angels are everywhere.
Hey. I'm here to see Lynette Scavo.
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi.
I'm Lynette. You must be Fran.
Hi. Ed said you needed to talk to me.
I couldn't imagine about what.
Oh, well, come on in my office.
you want me to put my daughter in day care?
but I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day.
maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon.
wouldn't that be great?
have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?
I don't need to unwind. I love taking care of little Mindy.
Oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it.
wouldn't it be nice to have someplace to take her before you want to strangle her?
I cherish every moment I spend with her, truly.
Really?
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna level with you.
Parcher and Murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least 16 kids and without little Mindy, we only have 15.
well, that's not my problem.
okay. Okay. I just thought I'd give it a shot.
well, I wish I could help you, but I can't.
okay.
Lynette, can I ask you something?
Yeah.
why did you have kids if you weren't gonna raise them?
excuse me?
well, I just don't understand women who say they want to be mothers, but then hand their kids over to glorified babysitters.
I work because my family needs me to.
Oh, dear, I've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.
I bet.
make no mistake, I'm a good mother.
that's the difference between us...
I couldn't settle for being a good mother.
I want to be a great one.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, hi, Alberta. How are you?
were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets?
I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies.
or I'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks.
Yep, looks like Carol's penmanship.
this is ridiculous. What does she think, we're having an affair?
well, she probably saw you drop me off yesterday, and she assumed the worst.
well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth.
Oh, no, no, no. I'd catch holy hell.
Oh, so you want me to catch it for you?
I mean, you, yourself said she's crazy.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed.
all right. I'll talk to her.
Hello, Edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?
no. That pretty much says it all.
sister Mary, what a lovely surprise.
well, I couldn't leave without saying good-bye, Gabrielle.
Oh, that's so sweet. I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm sure not half as much as you're gonna miss your husband. Huh?
don't freak out. I'm going to Botswana.
What?! Sister mary needs a companion.
what happened to sister Greta?!
I was gonna go with sister Greta, but the region is so volatile, I decided I'd feel much safer with a male companion.
Carlos, you can't do this.
you can't just go to Africa.
honey, I'm only gonna be gone for two months.
this journey is important for me.
I want to be one of god's soldiers.
and you will be one, Carlos.
after you see the devastation over there, you're never the same.
you see how selfish your old life is and you just want to get rid of everything
Oh, gosh. I should get going and start packing.
we leave in less than a week.
I should probably send a thank you letter to my parole officer.
he's being a real mensch about this.
I may be a Catholic, but I am so not above slapping a nun.
go ahead.
do it.
just make sure you hit hard enough to leave a mark.
Yeah. I didn't think so.
kiss the kids good night and I'll see them in the morning. Okay, yeah.
I love you, too. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry about the day care thing, Lynette, but Fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.
you know, since day one, all I ever got was, "support the head, support the head."
I think I know how to support a damn baby head.
Ohh, let's just... let's just do this.
I don't want to be here all night.
you're Mindy's father.
you have a right to spend time with her.
I know, but what can I do?
you could stand up to Fran.
if you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier.
and without a father figure, poor Mindy will grow up to be stripper.
a stripper?
there's science to back that.
you know what?
you go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette, and count Mindy in.
Yeah, I'll handle Fran.
you're doing the right thing, Ed, for little Mindy.
Yeah.
dude, what if your mom walks in?
she won't.
you don't know that.
just wait till everybody's asleep.
seriously.
I'll make it worth your while.
you better.
I wish she would walk in on us, just to see the expression on her face.
God, I hate her so much.
still, though, she's your mother.
don't you sort of have to love her?
last year, when she found out that I like guys, she freaked out.
she said that if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell, so since I knew that I couldn't change, it suddenly hit me that one day, my own mother was gonna stop loving me, so I decided to stop loving her first.
that way, it wouldn't hurt so bad.
she didn't know what she was saying.
Yes, she did, so now she's got to be punished.
how are you gonna punish her?
one day, she'll slip up, and I'll have something against her and when that happens, I'm gonna take her down so hard, she'll never get back up.
it may take you awhile to get something on her.
that's okay.
I don't mind waiting for the things that I want.
Lynette, hey, hey. Look who's here.
Hey! You know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.
if I had waited, I might have lost my nerve.
I had a window.
fran was in the shower, so I just grabbed the baby and ran.
you took the baby without telling Fran?
I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.
Mindy is my daughter, I wanted to spend time with her.
I have that right.
um, Ed, the lobby just called and your wife's on her way up and she seems pretty angry.
Oh, man.
here. Hold Mindy. Oh.
let me handle this.
Oh, I was planning to.
I thought Mindy had been kidnapped!
I left a sticky note.
I wasn't looking for a sticky note, Ed!
I was looking for my missing child!
she's my child, too, and she's staying here, just a few hours a day.
you, give her to me.
no, I made a decision.
yeah? Okay, watch me make a decision.
I'm done with this marriage. I'm taking my baby and I'm getting on a plane to Pittsburgh.
you wouldn't dare!
you think you miss Mindy now, wait till we're living with my mother!
I'll fight you on this. Yeah? Try...
as Lynette saw her dreams of day care about to board a plane to Pittsburgh, a baby needs her mother! You're crazy, you know that?!
Yeah! I'm crazy to think...
she decided this flight would have to be grounded.
you don't scare me.
Oh. Oh!
what the hell is she doing?!
open up! Give me my baby!
good thinking, Lynette!
I am not on your side, Ed. You're not?
no, I am on Mindy's side.
she is the one caught in the middle, and I'm not letting you two have her until you calm down.
I want my damn child.
Lynette, I have Tom on line two.
pat, can you see here I'm holding a baby hostage?!
I will call back!
all right, that's it. I'm calling the police.
Oh, for god's sakes! Lynette's not going to hurt the baby!
no, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me, okay?
listen, and you? All right, good.
so first of all, Ed, stealing the baby was really stupid.
thank you. You're welcome.
you need to find a better way to communicate with your wife.
and, Fran, I know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head.
you can take a break and be a great mom.
doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?
well, I guess the pressure does get to me a little.
and it's okay to admit that.
this is communication. This is good.
why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?
uh, what about Mindy?
we've got day care!
we've got day care. Hi. I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?
Hi. Piano player, right?
this is so generous of you.
there it is. It's not exactly a concert grand.
I should warn you, on the whole, our patients are generally unresponsive, so I hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.
miss Delaney, I find when the spiritual rewards are this great, who needs applause?
excuse me.
did Addison talk to you about me?
Oh! I guess not.
he's a married man!
what's wrong with you?! No, wait! Wait!
it's not what you think!
he hasn't touched me for three years because of sluts like you!
Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, I'll explain!
how... how can you explain?! You're screwing my husband!
no, I'm not screwing him! He's my father!
I'm so sorry.
I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you.
I want to die.
Oh, no. I do.
Oh, Carol, you don't have to clean that up.
they have clerks for that.
how old are you?
we've been married 39 years.
it's been going on from the start.
believe me, I didn't want to hurt anyone.
I just wanted to find my dad.
I'm glad you did, but you be careful, sweetheart.
he's gonna break your heart.
Andrew, I made an appointment with a therapist for you, me and Danielle.
I don't think so.
this pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it.
Andrew, I want us to heal, I want us to be a family again.
you know what I want?
I want for George Williams to walk through that door so I can take a knife and plunge it into his heart.
I want the pharmacist to pay for what he did to my father.
well, the good news is he's... he's dead.
he committed suicide. His death was on his terms.
that's not justice.
so are you saying if he were executed that it would be easier for you to get past this？ Of course.
George... didn't intend to commit suicide.
he was trying to manipulate me into taking him back, and he swallowed those pills hoping that I'd feel sorry for him.
he just assumed that I would call an ambulance.
when I got there, he was already slipping away.
I tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done...
but he wouldn't.
so what'd you do?
nothing.
I just sat there and let him die.
Oh my god.
he didn't die on his terms, Andrew.
he paid for what he did to your father.
thank you for telling me this.
Hey, how you doin'?
yeah?
Zach's come home.
what? Is he okay?
he's fine.
is there anything I can do?
thanks for asking you can leave us alone.
I spent a lot of time looking for Zach, and you know why.
maybe I'm not making myself clear.
you come near my son, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them what happened out in that quarry.
you do that and we'll both go down.
well, you know I'm capable of almost anything.
Hey, I thought you'd like to know Zach and I are moving away.
I want to give my son a shot at a normal life.
I'm sure you'll agree it's for the best.
now see, this is where you and I don't see eye-to-eye.
for Zach's sake, I'll keep quiet, for now, but you're not taking him away.
if I see a "for sale" sign in front of that house, I'll call the police.
I'm capable of pretty much anything myself.
the doctor's going to give you a full work-up, then we'll start the inoculations.
make sure you fill out everything and the nurse will take you back. Thank you.
right.
Yes, right.
she has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor, and there's perfectly good poor right here.
for god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy it's not the same.
no, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car.
the point is not to be comfortable, Gaby.
it's about easing pain and suffering.
look, I'm trying to be a better person here.
now you can either help me or you can get out of the way, but you can't stop me.
come with me, please.
finish that for me.
here.
he didn't fill out the allergy section.
honey, he's going to a remote village in Africa.
does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?
actually, yes. Eggs are on the list.
he could have a severe reaction to the yellow fever vaccine, and he won't be getting out of bed, let alone leaving the country.
Really?
Oh, don't write that down.
I wasn't being specific. He's allergic to fish eggs.
fish eggs?
poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar.
now that's suffering.
all right, doc, give me all you got.
it's so hot in this village.
baby, that's the fever talking.
the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?
hold me.
Ohh, honey. I'm so sorry.
Ohh, maybe that stupid nun is right.
maybe I am trying to stop you from becoming a better person.
it's just that I love you the way you are...
greedy, selfish and insensitive.
I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize I still am, and then you won't want me.
I want you. Just hold me.
Ohh.
Ohh, Carlos.
hold me...
sister Mary.
painting in the rain? Is that smart?
well, let me see, painting in the rain or letting the whole world think I'm a whore?
I don't know. What do you think?
heard you ran into my wife.
Yep.
so?
so you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad.
okay.
just so you know, I'm not actually proud of what I've done, you know, my hobbies.
good for you. Bye.
I have done things I'm proud of.
I could give you five examples right now.
okay, maybe three.
you don't have to do this.
I was a volunteer fireman.
I put out fires, I got kittens out of trees, the whole nine yards.
sweet.
about 20 years ago, I started a foundation to protect wild horses.
I probably saved hundreds of them.
Really?
I'm full of surprises.
okay, one more.
I wasn't exactly thrilled when you walked back into my life.
now that I've met you, well, you gave me a third thing to be proud of.
that was a good one.
that's why I saved it for last.
I have to spend some time working on my marriage.
when that's all sorted out, maybe we could continue with the catching up?
I'll wait for your call.
the stories are as old as time itself...
the prodigal son who returns home to the father who forgives him...
the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trusts her...
the desperate mother who risks everything for the child who needs her and the faithless husband who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply.
why do we listen again and again?
because these are the stories of family, and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment, we occasionally like to remind ourselves...
Hi! Hi.
there is absolutely nothing more important.
open it.
Oh, my God.
mac, there must have been 20 people trapped back there when it hit the water.
that hatch is how they escaped.
it's a miracle we only have two bodies.
make that three.
what happened here, Don?
this was a truck party gone bad.
it's the latest craze in after-hours entertainment.
they convert tractor trailers into exclusive nightclubs.
times and locations are spread among the social networks.
well, I'm assuming this one didn't start at the bottom of the Hudson.
I thought the truck was not supposed to move once the party starts.
it's not.
so who moved it?
couple cabbies nearly got run over, but they didn't get a good look at the driver's face.
they did say that he accelerated through the fence.
and the absence of skid marks confirms that there was no braking.
then the driver could have drowned, or may still be among the survivors.
well, we have divers in the water looking for more bodies, and the others are being transported to the precinct for questioning.
driver saw that river coming, jumped out before splashdown, then got the hell out of Dodge.
either way, looks like crashing this party wasn't an accident.
so, it's looking like whoever padlocked the rear door also drove the truck.
I found keys to the lock in the driver's side glove box.
unfortunately, the water removed any biological trace.
but I also found this next to our driver's seat.
Yeah, the label was removed, so I had Adam run a sample through the IR SPEC...
came back as acetylene.
mixed with oxygen, acetylene is used for cutting metal.
Or...for welding the safety hatch shut.
I found spot welds all around the frame, and then I found tiny metal fragments embedded in the driver's seat and in the carpet under the accelerator pedal.
multiple people may have planned this, but all the evidence points to only one person who carried it out.
a single perp. - Premeditated.
he knew people were going to suffer.
he didn't care.
if the safety hatch was sealed, how'd the survivors break through?
shoddy workmanship.
surface impurities in the under filling left the seams vulnerable to high-contraction stresses.
water pressure and, uh, freezing temperatures did the rest.
if this guy had known what he was doing, the hatch would have held, and they might all be dead.
just spoke with Flack.
the truck was rented with an alias from a party outfitter in Queens.
the owner was sent a big old wad of cash about two weeks ago.
someone had to pick it up.
no. The company dropped it off on the street, was scheduled to pick it up the next morning.
they left the keys?
they didn't have to. It was hot-wired.
this creep thought of everything.
to identify him, we still need to know why.
it's all about exclusivity.
just being invited means you're a somebody.
I don't think I'll ever forget that sound.
the screaming.
Abigail, did you see anybody near the cab of the truck?
somebody who could have driven it?
the truck was parked.
I assumed it was going to stay that way.
who threw this party?
a girl at work told me about it.
so you just showed up uninvited?
as long as you look hot, getting in is never a problem.
it was crazy, man.
one minute, I'm chatting up this really cute blonde.
the next...
great party?
did you know the people at the party?
somebody you may have hung out with before?
I don't go out much anymore.
tonight was supposed to be a change of pace.
instead, I almost died.
when was the rear door closed?
I was dancing, enjoying some cocktails.
I didn't notice.
any idea who might have closed it?
could have been anyone.
we were all having the time of our lives.
then all of a sudden, it felt like the world was coming to an end.
the water was so cold, it felt like my body was on fire.
the clock was ticking.
I knew we had to get everyone out of there.
we tried the back door, but it wouldn't budge.
that's because it was locked.
locked?
wait a minute, are you telling me someone did this to us on purpose?
Why?
that's exactly what we're going to find out.
the escape hatch was our last hope.
had to get it open.
listen, Chris, when you arrived at the party, was there someone there to greet you?
like, was there a host?
not really, just...
I just followed the music.
that guy over there is a hero.
I don't even know his name.
his name is Chris.
I owe him my life.
we all do.
was there anybody in the water that you didn't recognize from the party?
it was too dark.
I closed my eyes and kicked as hard as I could.
what about on the dock?
honestly, all I could think about was seeing my family again.
once I was out of the truck, I swam towards the light.
that first breath of air was like I was being reborn.
that must sound crazy.
you're one of the lucky ones.
not everybody got out alive?
no, not everybody.
cameron Marshall, age 27.
copious quantities of river water in his lungs and stomach confirms COD as drowning.
looks like vic number two's throat was crushed.
Brett Hollister, age 25.
suffered blunt force laryngeal trauma resulting in complete cricotracheal separation.
water in the lungs?
trace amounts.
he stopped breathing before the truck sank.
I imagine he floated up through the open hatch.
sadly, victim number three wasn't quite as fortunate.
doctor? - Thank you.
an elevated blood alcohol content caused vasodilation of her blood vessels, thereby exacerbating the onset of hypothermia.
she would have experienced numbness, debilitating drowsiness.
she knew she was drowning but was powerless to stop it.
her last moments on earth were spent in excruciating pain.
just got fingerprint results.
unlike her male counterparts, she wasn't carrying a wallet in her back pocket.
AFIS match courtesy of an old DUI arrest.
Jane Doe is actually Ms. Victoria Enzo of Queens.
our female vic is the daughter of Carmen Enzo, head of Local 225...
sanitation Workers' Union.
type of goons you cross the street to avoid.
so the party and random guests could've just been a cover.
the murderer might have been targeting only one person: Enzo's daughter.
two sanitation workers were killed last year by faulty equipment.
Enzo negotiated a sweetheart deal favoring their employers, betraying a boat load of union members in the process.
his daughter's murder could have been retribution.
that's a lot of collateral damage to send a message.
not if you want it received loud and clear.
you don't have any idea who did this to my girl, do you?
not yet.
when Vicky was little, she used to love to play dress up.
her favorite...
was to dress up in this...
white satin wedding dress her mother made for her.
my job was walking her down the make-believe aisle.
I'm sorry for your loss.
I have no use for your sympathy.
well, then know that every effort is being made to bring your daughter's killer to justice.
justice.
justice means different things to different people, Detective.
Mr. Enzo...
there are serious consequences for interfering with a police investigation.
then stop wasting time...
so I won't have to.
we have reason to believe that Victoria may have been targeted because of you and the nature of your work.
her murder may have been a warning.
you and the other members of your family may still be in danger.
I've made my fair share of enemies over the years.
occupational hazard.
but my wife...
and my children...
they're supposed to be off limits.
not everybody cares about the rules.
I'm going to need the names of your most vocal opponents, personal and professional.
that's a long list.
sit down.
there's someone you gotta meet.
Vicky wasn't supposed to be at that party.
how do you know that, Jessica?
because I was the one invited...
not her.
I asked her to go in my place.
it's my fault that she's dead.
it should have been me!
I got the invitation in the mail a couple months ago.
said I was a VIP.
was there any indication who sent it?
return address? RSVP number?
no, I-I...
I remember thinking how weird that was, but...
I mean, look at it. It's a work of art. It...
if someone put that much effort into the invite, the party itself was going to be insane.
when did you tell Victoria about the party?
couple hours before it was supposed to start.
I was stuck at the bar where I work, and...
and if I wasn't going to enjoy it, I...
at least wanted her to.
you could have gone late.
the directions...they were very clear.
they said that no one was getting in after midnight.
or getting out.
we need to know who else our mystery host personally invited.
all right, so, I got nine guests who heard about the party word of mouth...
some received texts, some got it through tweets, but none actually received an invite.
and none of them know anything about the driver.
I interviewed two who described handmade invitations like Jessica Thompson's:
Chris Boyle and Abigail West.
add Neal Cooper to that list.
he said he got his invite in the mail, as well.
Hawkes checked with the families of the two male DOAs.
they said both had plans for the evening but changed them to go check out some truck party.
if they heard about it last minute, let's eliminate them for now.
all right, so that leaves us with four VIPs.
the killer used formal invitations to ensure his targets would be in attendance.
if we can find a connection between them...
we'll know who wanted them dead.
how do you want to play this?
divide and conquer.
individually, each holds an important piece of the puzzle.
they just don't know it yet.
here you go.
well, they all look familiar.
but then again, I'm a bartender.
I see hundreds of faces every day.
right.
her.
Yeah, I saw this one at the party.
what about before last night?
no.
you sure about that?
Oh, yeah.
I'd remember a face like that.
I don't want to be wrong.
it's not a test.
close your eyes. It might help to visualize meeting them.
I'm sorry.
I can't remember.
were all of these people at the party last night?
not all of them.
I'm not very good at this.
my parents taught me to look past physical appearances.
they sound like smart people.
they were.
Neal, can you think of anybody who'd want to hurt you?
someone from your past?
person you might have accidentally rubbed the wrong way?
was there anybody that might have held a grudge against you?
I'm a housewife from Jersey.
I have two little kids.
this party was the first time I had been out in a long time.
the only thing that I can think of are the phone calls.
phone calls?
prank calls, in the middle of the night, over and over, from what sounded like the same man. I...
he didn't tell me his name, but he told me to watch my back.
did you report him to the police?
I was going to, but then they stopped.
I just figured that he had moved on to somebody else.
prank calls? Actually...
Yeah. Now that you mention it, someone did call me a bunch of times.
they didn't say anything.
they just laughed.
anything else out of the ordinary?
the garbage cans.
what about them?
they had been rifled through, tipped over, every day for a week.
could have been an animal.
that's what I thought.
but my husband, he tied down the covers, and it kept happening.
we finally had to put them in the garage.
someone was rummaging through my life.
through my family's life.
I mean, this was years ago.
someone has been watching me this whole time?
Jessica Thompson's car was broken into seven times over a six-month period, and nothing was ever stolen.
all four of them experienced incidents of aggravated harassment over a similar time period.
sounds like they all had a stalker.
but not necessarily the same one.
you think this may be a coincidence?
stalking is about obsession.
typically with a single object of intense hate or affection.
in rare cases of multiple victims, there is almost always a consistent pattern or modality.
our targets include both men and women, across a wide social spectrum.
but if they were all being stalked by the same individual, then we're gonna have to dig a whole lot deeper to find the common trigger.
until we do, the only confirmed link between them is the invitation.
what the...?
find something?
Yeah, check this out.
I started with the paper, vellum...
that comes from the French for "calfskin.
it's vegetable-based and still mondo bucks.
it was negative for prints and available in over a dozen stores in the area.
what about the ink?
Japanese.
made only in the fall with pine and camphor.
also ridiculously expensive.
but there was something else in the batch.
human blood.
I-I'm thinking it's from the artist who made the invitation.
or anyone else who handled it.
no chance.
the blood saturation is consistent throughout.
it was mixed in the ink before it was dried.
excuse us.
who are you?
the art police.
we have some thoughts and concerns.
how you doing?
did you make this invitation?
I make art, not stationery.
we matched the DNA in the ink to an ex-con named Wanda Cole.
now, Wanda certainly isn't as exotic as Akiko, but neither is writing bad checks and running scams on the elderly.
that was a misunderstanding.
of course it was.
so in order to avoid any more misunderstandings, let's try this again.
is this your work, Wanda?
I put blood in my ink to verify authenticity.
did one of your regulars commission these invitations?
like I said, I don't typically do stationery, but this guy paid up front,$20, 000 cash, five grand apiece.
what was his name?
John something.
smith, maybe.
how about a description?
wasn't much to describe.
he barely made eye contact.
I guess I make men nervous.
what do you remember?
he had, uh, dark hair, light skin.
bit of a stutter.
dark hair, light skin, a bit of a stutter.
that is very helpful.
maybe there's a better way to jog an artist's memory.
there you go.
the likeness is vague, but it may help spark a memory.
I didn't...
I didn't want to say anything before,'cause I thought I was just being paranoid.
well, tell me what happened.
well, I was coming out of a movie, and I stopped for a bite to eat, and that's when I saw him. He was staring at me. And...
there was something in his eyes.
you think this could be the guy?
Yes. But his, uh, well, his...
his eyes were further apart, um...
and they were...
they were deeper set.
and, uh, yeah, I think his hair was longer on the sides.
and, uh, he had a scar.
I'm sure of it.
ladies' room is around the corner, three doors down.
okay.
I'll wait right here. - Thanks.
Jessica, what is it?
that's Johnny.
you know that man?
we were engaged.
I met John senior year of college.
we went out one time, and then...
lost track of each other after that.
when did you reconnect?
About...three years ago.
a mutual friend set us up on a blind date.
we started dating on and off after that.
then last year, he surprised me with an engagement ring.
and you accepted his proposal?
at first, yes.
but then I saw a side of him that made me uncomfortable.
uncomfortable how?
he became possessive and needy.
if I didn't check in with him regularly, he would accuse me of cheating.
I even caught him following me.
things got...
they got really bad between us.
I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong.
I didn't dump Johnny.
he called it off with me.
that type of behavior's consistent with stalking.
could have been John's misguided attempt at repairing the relationship.
why didn't Jessica mention this before?
she could've missed the connection.
or she's covering for him.
ran John Everett through the system.
apart from a few unpaid parking tickets, he's a regular choir boy.
giant leap from double-parking to mass murder.
not with the proper motivation.
all right, so far, we've linked him to Neal Cooper, Jessica Thompson...
what about the other two?
I showed his picture to Abigail West, and she said he could be the perv job who's been hanging around her kids' park.
but she wasn't 100% sure.
similar thing with Chris Boyle.
he interrupted a guy breaking into his gym locker a while back.
chased the guy, but never got a good look at his face.
why go after them?
their lives must have intersected somewhere else.
John Everett! NYPD!
bedroom's clear. This place is empty.
he could be on the run already.
issue an alert.
put his picture out to every roll call and precinct in the city.
got it.
bit of overkill on the deadbolts for such a decent neighborhood, no?
this guy must've been afraid of something.
or the world in general.
social isolation.
an indication of paranoid schizophrenia.
I'll be right back. - All right.
what do you got there?
looks like we got some dried blood.
could be from another vic.
detective.
thought I made myself clear.
any interference with this investigation will not be tolerated.
Everett hasn't been back here or to his mother's house in Brooklyn.
how do you know his name?
I got eyes and ears on the street, just like you, Detective.
just go home.
I'll call you when we have the suspect in custody.
if I find him first, maybe I'll give you a call.
Jo. So I examined the bloodstains we found in Everett's apartment, and I got this.
two unique profiles.
blood came from different people, both male.
and I took the liberty of borrowing Everett's toothbrush for a secondary reference sample.
I got a match to one of the profiles.
what about the other?
struck out with CODIS, but whoever it was made that head-sized crater in the wall.
dark hairs I found in the drywall are a match to blood donor number two.
so Everett fought with someone in his apartment.
Yeah, and by the looks of that hole, he kicked some ass.
maybe one of his stalking victims came to confront him.
are you absolutely sure?
I'll be right there. - Something turn up?
coast Guard found Everett's body trapped in submerged pylons way downriver.
current is especially strong this time of year.
how long was he in the water?
skin slippage suggests immersion of at least 24 hours.
hello.
I'll posit penetrating cranial trauma as COD.
looks like there's something inside.
look at his clothing.
he's dressed to impress.
but the driver did everything he could not to be seen.
this guy wanted to be noticed.
I think John Everett was a guest at the party.
could he have also been the host?
not unless he invited himself.
this was in his back pocket.
a fifth invitation.
the artist said she only made four.
that means one of our victims has been lying to us.
according to Everett's phone records, he's got hundreds of inbound calls coming in, all lasting under five seconds.
he was also being harassed.
explains the deadbolts and covered windows.
landlord also said John came home a few months ago to surprise a guy searching through his stuff.
I pulled the complaint report.
Everett described the guy as skinny, mid-to-late 20s, with dark hair.
says they fought, but the guy got away.
John Everett wasn't doing the stalking, he was a victim of it himself.
makes him the real fourth target.
Hey, guys, we processed the clothing Everett was wearing when he died, including some handmade biker boots.
the toe plate was riveted in a crescent fashion.
it's the same pattern I found dented into the driver's side door.
all right, so he kicked the side of the truck?
or used it for leverage.
what if the driver never made it out of the cab before it went into the river?
what if he was also trapped?
John saw a man about to drown and went back to save him.
if Everett recognized him as the man in his apartment, he would have outed him to the cops.
and that's why he killed him first.
so he risks his life to save this sick bastard, and instead of getting a well-deserved thanks, gets a body bag?
the company that rented the truck is called Demon Dog Deliveries.
and that's the hood emblem they use on all their vehicles, a demon dog.
except, the one on our truck is missing its left horn.
John's body washed away, while his murderer swam to the surface and played helpless victim.
so one of our victims is really our driver.
there's a killer among us.
Jessica Thompson wasn't at the party.
I mean, she could've done this.
Why?
sour grapes over her fiance giving her the heave-ho?
that's no good.
her boss confirmed that she was behind the bar all night.
Plus, the dragon lady was pretty damn sure that she sold the invites to a stuttering man.
that's that.
that also eliminates Abigail West.
and then there were two.
we're gonna need the invitation you received for evidence.
I'm sure I've got it somewhere.
I brought the invitation with me to the party.
where is it now?
probably at the bottom of the river.
okay. You told Detective Messer you felt a responsibility to rescue everyone from the truck.
it was the right thing to do.
it was quite heroic.
I'm-I'm no hero.
well, you will be.
when the world hears about all the lives you saved?
magazines, talk shows...
this tragedy's going to make you the center of attention.
that's the last thing I want.
Why?
I was a...
high school All-American.
starting quarterback in college.
sports was easy, but...
being in the spotlight all the time, that's what I couldn't handle.
ruined my chances at going pro.
your parents are deceased.
they died in an accident last year.
must've been difficult for you.
did you get help?
talk to a therapist?
there's nothing wrong with me.
never said there was.
wait.
would you...
put that on the table?
hold on.
pour Mr. Cooper a glass.
you have a girlfriend, Neal?
why does that matter?
there were a lot of women at that party.
beautiful, sexy women, way out of your league.
I didn't really notice.
tell me, Neal...
why do you think a guy like you got invited to hang out with all those pretty people?
I don't want to talk to her; I want to go home.
answer the question.
I...I don't know.
must've been a mistake, right?
I mean, come on, let's face it, you're just an average, ordinary nobody.
a loser.
the kind that women like me don't know exist.
bitch!
you think that you're b-better than me, don't you?
not better than you, Neal.
just not a murderer.
we searched your apartment, found your parent" life insurance policy.
you've been plotting revenge for years, haven't you?
the sudden influx of cash finally made it possible.
you d-d-don't know anything.
we know you tutored Chris Boyle, first few months freshman year.
Chris spent the rest of his time partying with the in-crowd, while you spent all your time by yourself.
he never invited me out, n-n-not once!
and Abigail West.
she grew up across the street from your family.
she was your best friend, until middle school.
when Abigail found a new set of friends and left you behind.
she abandoned me!
Jessica Thompson never even knew your name.
but you certainly knew hers, didn't you?
we found the poems you wrote, the sketches.
the photos you took of her and John Everett.
J-Jessica was in love with him, and he threw her away.
he d-deserved to die!
and when you couldn't have her, so did Jessica.
N-N-N-Nobody wanted me.
I was tired of being alone.
that's why I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that you spend the rest of your life in solitary confinement.
all alone.
Neal Cooper lived his entire life convinced the world had wronged him.
decided to kill the people he held most responsible.
if he'd spent less time blaming them, he'd have realized the real enemy was himself.
perception can be a dangerous thing.
here he comes! Here he comes!
Neal Cooper, ask you a few questions?
he killed my daughter!
you BRAINWASHED ME?
brainwashing IS SOMETHING THEY DO IN THE MOVIES.
we MANIFESTED A SPLIT PERSONITY.
talk TO ME, TO - NAME'S NOT TOM.
I DIDN'T VOLUNTEER! - NO, YOU DIDN'T. BUT EDWARD DID.
your PAREN WERE NOT KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT.
they WERE MURDERED.
I BECAME A SPY SO I COULD FIND THE SPY WHO MURDERED THEM.
you SURE YOU WANT TO CROSS THIS LINE?
I'm NOT READY TO BURN AN ASSET AS VALUABLE AS EDWARD.
at LEAST, NOT YET.
you MURDERED THEM.
I'm ON VACI STREET.
perfect.
CESNIK IS SET TO MEET HIS BUYER
in FRONT OF THE HOTEL VADAS IN THE NEXT FOUR MINUTES.
we HAVE SECURITY VIDEO OF CESNIK CHANGING TRAINS IN BUCHAREST.
he's GOT THE WARHEAD WITH HIM IN A BRIEFCASE.
uh, GOT HIM.
I IMAGINE MOLDOVA'S NOT GONNA BE TOO HAPPY
when THEY DISCOVER THE DEFENSE MINISTER'S SELLING OLD SOVIET WEAPONS ON THE BLACK MARKET.
good WORK, AVENGER. THESE PHOTOS'LL PUT CESNIK AWAY FOR A LONG TIME.
any SIGN OF THE BUYER?
not YET.
whoop.
Hey, UH, WOULD YOU MIND IF I GOT A PHOTO OF YOU GUYS
for A MAGAZINE ARTICLE ON TOURISM?
how DID YOU KNOW WE'RE TOURISTS?
Oh, JUST A GUESS.
Ah, LOVELY.
thank YOU SO MUCH.
THERE...TONY, GET AN I. D. ON THE BUYER.
uh, HE'S, UH, HE'S NOT IN OUR SYSTEM.
give ME A SECOND.
who AM I LOOKING AT?
this IS WEIRD. THE IMAGE MATCHED TO A GUY BY THE NAM OF DANIEL SHAW.
it SAYS HERE HE'S EX-D. O.D.
most OF HIS FILE'S BEEN REDACTED. WE DON'T HAVE CLEARANCE.
get ELIZABETH Q OVER AT D. O.D. ON THE PHONE.
avenger, CHANGE OF PLANS.
the BUYER IS AMERICAN, EX-INTELLIGENCE.
we JUST DON'T KNOW WHETH HE'S WITH US OR AGAINST US.
do NOT ENGAGE. REPEAT, DO NOT ENGAGE.
UH...YEAH!
Yeah, UH UH, MY COMMS WENT DEAD FOR A SECOND.
please REPEAT.
stay ON SHAW, AVENGER, BUT KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.
uh, SHAW, RIGHT. GOT IT, GOT IT.
uh, TARGET'S ON THE MOVE.
with A BRIEFCASE.
okay, SHAW IS AN UNKNOWN QUANTITY.
and WHILE THE WARHEAD ALONE ISN'T DANGEROUS,
we ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT HE MIGHT DO WITH IT.
avenger?
20 YEARS AT THE D. O.D.
I DITCHED OUT REPORT AFTER REPORT...
Ahh! GOD!
potential TERRORIST ATTACKS.
no ONE CARED.
now I BECOME ONE...
they FINALLY START TO LISTEN.
I COULD HAVE KILLED YOU BACK THERE.
but I WANNA KNOW WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR.
WHO...DO YOU WORK FOR?
you're NOT STUFFY ENOUGH TO BE N. S.A.
no C. I.A. SWAGGER.
so...
let ME BE MORE SPECIFIC THIS TIME.
tell ME WHO IT IS YOU'RE LISTENING FOR, OR...
I WILL KILL YOU.
Aah! NO!
NOW...LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
WHO...DO YOU WORK FOR?
S-SALVATION ARMY.
well, THAT'S TOO BAD.
cause WHILE I WANT THIS INFORMATION,
I DON'T REALLY NEED IT.
there's A BODY IN HERE. COME PICK IT UP.
Oh, GOD.
yes?
hey...it's ME.
thank GOD YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.
where IS SHAW?
target's IN THE WIND.
contact INTERPOL.
but LISTEN TO ME FIRST.
I THINK I FIGURED IT OUT.
I KNOW HOW HENRY AND I CAN BE FIXED.
I WOKE UP WHEN SHAW ELECTROCUTED ME.
it WASN'T CHANCE.
the SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN YOU USED THE DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES ON HIM IN THE AMBULANCE.
Edward, WE'VE TRIED HITTING THE CHIP WITH ELECTRIC PULSES BEFORE TO REBOOT IT.
nothing's EVER WORKED.
Yeah, BUT WE'VE NEVER USED ANYTHING THAT STRONG.
the OUTLET WAS 220 VOLTS.
50's ENOUGH TO KILL SOMEONE.
it's TOO RISKY.
I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING IT
to KEEP TRUMBULL FROM DISCOVERING THAT I'M BROKEN.
but SOONER OR LATE, HE IS GONNA FIGURE IT OUT,
and THEN HE'S GONNA KILL ME.
unless HENRY BEATS HIM TO IT.
no, THIS IS A CHANCEAT A REAL FIX.
TRUMBULL'S TALKING TO D. O.D. ABOUT SHAW.
if WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS,
we NEED TO DO IT NOW-- CALL NORA.
if WE'RE GONNA FRY YOU,
it CERTAINLY DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE A DOCTOR ON HAND.
no RAYMOND?
why NOT GET THE WHOLE TEAM TOGETHER?
we'll HAVE A BARBECUE.
Raymond's IN BOSTON RIGHT NOW ON LEGITIMAT AJ SUN BUSINESS.
pole DANCING SHOULD DEFINITELY BE IN THE OLYMPICS.
like SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING.
but WIOUT THE WATER.
or THE SUITS.
Hey, TOMMY...
how 'BOUT ANOTHER ROUND?
Ah, NO PROBLEM.
that's WHA THE CORPORATE CARD IS FOR.
Hi. ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE.
Yes.
HEY...DO I KNOW YOU?
I DON'T THINK SO.
you SURE?
cause YOU LOOK REAL FAMILIAR.
you FROM AROUND HERE? - NOPE.
I NEVER FORGET A FACE.
sorry, BUDDY, I CAN'T HELP YOU OUT HERE.
I'm NOT WHO YOU THINK I AM.
here YOU GO.
take IT EASY.
Cheers.
that GUY HAVE A TAB GOING?
Yeah, OF COURSE.
can I SEE HIS I. D. PLEASE?
thank YOU.
I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS, EDWARD.
this ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
electroconvulsive THERAPY CAUSES SEIZURES.
it CAN TURN YOU INTO A VEGETABLE IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.
then BE CAREFUL.
I've SHUT DOWN SECURI FEEDS TO THIS ROOM FOR THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.
Edward's VITALS LOOK GOOD.
and I'VE GOT A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE BLOOD FLOW PATTERNS IN HIS BRAIN.
it SHOULD TELL US WHEN HENRY WAKES UP.
are YOU SURE? - YES.
uh, YOU SEE,
this IS EDWARD, THIS IS HENRY.
they're THE SAME PERSON,
even BRAIN ACTIVITY IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
so IF EDWARD SWITCHES TO HENRY,
all THIS TURNS YELLOW.
Yeah.
okay, UH, WE'RE A GO WHEN YOU'RE READY.
I'm READY.
does THIS MEAN IT'S WORKING?
uh, NO, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PARIETO-INSULAR CORTEX.
it's THE PAIN CENTER OF THE BRAIN.
uh, STILL NO SIGN OF A SWITCH.
this IS TOO MUCH FOR HIM! WE SHOULD TURN IT OFF NOW!
uh, YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.
his HEART'S NOT HANDLING THIS WELL.
if WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SWITCH BY NOW, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.
turn IT OFF!
he WAS WRONG.
it WASN'T WRONG TO HOPE THAT THIS COULD WORK, EDWARD.
you're NO WORSE OFF THAN YOU WERE THIS MORNING.
I KNOW, THIS MORNING HENRY ALMOST GOT ME KILLED.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MIRACLES I HAVE LEFT.
then TEACH HIM. HE CAN LEARN.
Oh, PLEASE.
every MISSION I GO ON IS A SUICIDE MISSION WITH THIS GUY,
and THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.
and IF YOU COULD?
what IF HENRY WASN'T YOU, BUT JUST SOME MAN?
I'd KILL HIM.
what ARE YOU THINKING?
good AFTERNOON, HENRY.
I've BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO WAKE UP.
as YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE STILL ALIVE,
no THANKS TO YOU.
but IF WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE,
things HAVE TO CHANGE.
specifically, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE.
pick UP THE PISTOL ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF YOU.
when YOU WAKE UP ON MISSIONS,
you CAN'T DEPEND ON ME,
or SOON ENOUGH, YOU'LL GET US BOTH KILLED.
if THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE NOW
when NATIONAL SECURITY WON'T BE COMPROMISED.
so I'VE HIRED AN ASSASSIN TO KILL US.
What?! - HE'S ALREADY HERE.
in LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES, HE'LL FIND YOU.
if YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF THIS PLACE ALIVE,
you're HOME FREE.
it's EITHER YOU OR HIM, HENRY.
I HOPE YOU CHOOSE YOU.
your TIME TRYING TO FIND AN EXIT.
I've WELDED THE DOORS SHUT.
you SON OF A-- - AND THERE'S NO WINDOWS.
that's WHY I CHOSE IT.
okay.
nice TRY, EDWARD.
if I DIE, YOU DIE.
and IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW YOU CARE MORE ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD,
it's YOURSELF.
so I'M NOT PLAYING YOUR STUPID LITTLE GAME, OKAY?
I AM CALLING YOUR BLUFF.
Ohh! JEEZ!
you ALWAYS SEEM TO BRING ME BAD NEWS, ALISTAIR.
most NEWS IS BAD NEWS.
what's THE PROBLEM?
my PEOPLE CAN'T SEEM TO ACCESS A D. O.D. PERSONNEL FILE
for THE FORMER G. S.A DIRECTOR DANIEL SHAW.
well, WE QUIETLY PUT HIM OUT TO PASTURE A YEAR AGO.
he WAS EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF D. O.D. POLICIES FOLLOWING 911.
specifically, THE PATRIOT ACT.
Shaw's A CONSTITUTIONALIST?
Oh, QUITE THE CONTRARY.
he THINKS THE PATRIOT ACT'S A SLAP ON THE WRIST.
when HIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO BOLSTER DISCRETIONARY POWERS WEREN'T HEARD,
he WENT ROGUE.
well, THEN, I'M AFRAID THIS MAY BE THE BAD NEWS.
Shaw JUST PURCHASED AN ALAZAN-5 WARHEAD.
his FOCUS AT D. O.D. WAS ON R. D.D. ATTACK PREVENTION.
he KNOWS AN ALAZAN WARHEAD CONTAINS ENOUGH RADIOACTIVE STRONTIUM AND CAESIUM
to MAKE THREE DIRTY BOMBS.
if HE WANTS TO PROVE HOW WEAK OUR DEFENSES ARE,
he'll ATTACK A U. S. TARGET ABROAD.
everyone KNOWS...
policy DOESN'T SHIFT UNLESS AMERICANS DIE.
I'm GIVING YOUR PEOPLE LEVEL 8 CLEARANCE TO THE D. O.D. MAINFRAME AND ALL FILES ON SHAW.
find HIM.
where ARE WE ON SHAW'S FILES?
well, I LINKED INTO D. O.D.'S MAINFRAME,
and I'M CROSS-REFERENCING SHAW'S REPORT ON U. S. VUERABILITIES ABROAD
against STRATEGIC TARGETS FOR A SUITCASE BOMBING.
what's OUR TIME FRAME?
uh, I SHOULD THINK AT LEAST SIX HOURS TO MINE THE DATABASE.
and, UH, LISTEN, UH...
there's, UH, ONE OTHER THING.
I THINK I FIGURED OUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO ACTIVATE THE SWITCH BETWEEN EDWARD AND HENRY.
but, UH...IT'S RISKY.
he ALMOST DIED THE FIRST TIME.
I KNOW.
set IT UP...DISCREETLY.
maybe NEXT CHRISTMAS WE SHOULD GET SOME STUFF FOR THE KIDS TOO.
which ONE OF YOU BEAUTIFUL LADIES IS MARY GRADY?
who's ASKING?
name's GREENE.
I GO WAY BACK WITH YOUR HUSBAND RAYMOND.
but HE GOES BY TOM NOW, RIGHT?
I've NEVER HEARD ANYONE CALL HIM RAYMOND.
well, MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR HUSBAND AS WELL AS YOU THINK YOU DO.
excuse ME?
Yeah, I RAN INTO HIM IN BOSTON AT A STRIP JOINT, OF ALL PLACES.
and HE WAS HAVING A HELL OF A TIME.
you KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
Hey.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
do YOU KNOW THIS GUY?
easy, RAYMOND.
I WAS ST CHATTING IT UP WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
my NAME IS NOT RAYMOND.
Tom, WHAT'S GOING ON?
Yeah, TOM.
why DON'T YOU TELL HER WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
it's NOT OFTEN YOU GO TO SEE A DEAD MAN.
I'm NOT A DEAD MAN. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
you're GOOD, RAYMOND.
when SULLIVAN GETS IN, YOU DROP THE ACT.
he DOESN'T ENJOY GAMES AS MH AS I DO.
all RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA CALL THE POLICE.
no NEED. I WAS JUST LEAVING.
nice TO MEET YOU LADIES.
Raymond, I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
are YOU OKAY? DID HE DO ANYTHING TO YOU?
did YOU MEET HIM AT A STRIP CLUB, TOM?
did YOU LIE TO ME?
Yes, BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME, I
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BELIEVE YOU ANYMORE.
in LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES, HE'LL FIND YOU.
if YOU CAN MAKE IT OUT OF THIS PLACE ALIVE,
you're HOME FREE...
please, I DON'T WANNA DO THIS.
I've GOT A WIFE AND TWO KIDS NOT MUCH YOUNGER THAN YOU!
Oh, JEEZ.
Hey.
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU HOME.
are YOU OKAY?
honey, WHAT HAPPENED?
Oh, IT'S NOTHING. IT'S JUST BEEN, UH...
it's BEEN A REALLY BAD DAY.
I, UH, I GOT INTO A FIGHT AT WORK TODAY.
a PHYSICAL ONE?
almost.
with WHO?
it's NOTHING. IT'S STUPID. IT'S, UH...
I JUST GOT REALLY SCARED.
well...
being SCED IS WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM GETTING HURT.
I WASN'T AFRAID OF BEING HURT.
well, THEN, WHAT WERE YOU SCARED OF?
I WAS AFRAID I WANTED TO HURT HIM.
I WANTED TO KILL HIM.
it's ONLY HUMAN TO FEEL LIKE YOU WANNA KILL SOMEONE, HENRY.
but FEELING LIKE IT AND NOT DOING IT IS WHAT KEEPS US FROM BECOMING MONSTERS.
and YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER.
is THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANNA TELL ME?
cause IF YO NEED ANYTHING...
I'm HERE.
I NEED YOU.
can't WE JUST STAY IN BED ALL DAY?
that WOULD BE NICE.
do YOU WANNA TELL ME WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WITH THE GUY AT WORK TODAY?
ang, I CAN'T NOW. IS THAT OKAY?
sure.
actually, NO.
you KNOW, I ALWAYS ASK YOU... HOW YOUR DAY WAS.
and YOU GIVE ME THIS VAGUE EXPLANATION.
and IT'S NOT OKAY, HENRY.
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TOM AND MARY.
come ON, THAT'S NOT US.
I KNOW, BUT IT COULD BE.
he DOESN'T TELL HER ANYTHING ANYMORE.
he's LIED SO MUCH THAT...
even I BELIEVED THIS GUY THAT WAS HARASSING US THIS ORNING WHO WAS ACCUSING TOM OF...
not BEING WHO HE SAID HE WAS.
w-wait.
uh, WHO DID THINK TOM WAS?
he KEPT CALLING HIM RAYMOND.
so YOU KNOW THESE GUYS?
Yep. YEP?
Raymond, AFTER BEING TORTURED AND TRAPPED ON A BOAT WITH A TRAINED ASSASSIN,
I JUST LEFT MY WIFE IN A NICE, WARM BED TO WARN YOU ABOUT THIS.
so ALL I GET IS A "YEP"?
Yep.
listen TO ME.
these GUYS THREATENED TOM, MARY, AND MY WIFE.
so YOU BETTER TELL ME WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON.
it's MY SITUATION.
I'll HANDLE IT.
well, YOU BETTER HANDLE IT, OR I'LL-- I'LL TELL MAVIS!
Ooh.
Oh, UM, HEY, UH... WE FIGURED IT OUT.
figured WHAT OUT?
how TO FIX YOU.
what?
Oh! HENRY.
Hey, UM, OKAY, LISTEN. UH, WHEN YOU WERE ASLEEP,
we CONDUCTED THIS EXPERIMENT,
which WE BELIEVED WOULD FIX THE SWITCH BETWEEN YOU AND EDWARD.
it DIDN'T WORK.
but I THINK I FIGURED OUT WHY.
wait, WAIT-- ARE YOU TELL ME THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE?
no EDWARD, NO JANUS, NO MISSIONS?
if IT WORKS, YEAH.
you JUST MADE MY DAY.
Oh, ALL RIGHT.
Mmm! COME ON.
edward WAS RIGHT ABOUT SHAW TRIGGERING A SWITCH.
he WAS JUST WRONG ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED.
see, THE ICE YOU WERE SUBMERGED IN MAY HAVE DROPPED YOUR CORE TEMPERATURE BELOW 84 DEGREES.
so, CLINICALLY, HE DIED.
exactly.
with NO ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH THE BRAIN TO POWER THE CHIP,
it TURNED OFF.
then WHEN SHAW ELECTROCUTED HENRY,
it REBOOTED AND WOKE EDWARD UP.
so WE'RE MIMICKING HIS DEATH TO TRY TO FIX HIM-- BRILLIANT IDEA.
it's REALLY NOT SO BAD, ONCE...YOUR LEGS GO NUMB.
are YOU HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?
no, COURSE NOT. UHH!
I'll SLEEP BETTER AT NIGHT KNOWING MY FAMILY'S SAFE FROM ME.
the SOONER EDWARD'S OUT OF MY LIFE, THE SOONER...UH...
he STOPPED SHIVERING.
that MEANS HE'S REACHED LEVEL THREE HYPOTHERMIA.
Henry, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Ah, HIS PULSE RATE'S DROPPED TO 46, BUT HE'S STABLE.
we're READY.
his OVERALL BRAIN ACTIVI IS DECLINING FROM THE COLD.
but WE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE SWITCH HERE.
if EDWARD WAKES UP IT'LL TURN YELLOW AND STAY THAT WAY.
start THE E. C.T.
okay, HENRY, HERE WE GO.
what's HIS STATUS?
uh, STILL NO CHANGE.
his CORE TEMP'S FALLING. WE NEED TO UP THE VOLTAGE.
turn IT OF - WAIT, HOLD ON A SECOND. - TURN IT OFF!
he's FLAT-LINING!
we NEED TO GET HIM OUT NOW!
lift.
easy. WATCH HIS HEAD.
what DID YOU SEE ON THAT SCREEN, TONY?
I DON'T KNOW.
I've NEVER SEEN A BRAIN DO THAT BEFORE.
I SUGGEST YOU FIGURE IT OUT.
Edward. - UHH!
I THOUGHT THAT WAS IT,
that I'D ABLE TO COME HOME TO ANGIE WITHOUT ANY MORE BURDENS.
that I'D BE GIVEN SOME IMPLANTED ANSWERS FOR ALL OF HER QUESTIONS.
ignorance ISN'T ALWAYS BLISS.
I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.
you SEEM QUITE SURE OF THAT.
I AM.
Henry, CAN YOU HONESTLY TELL ME THERE'S NO PART OF YOU THAT THOUGHT YOU MIGHT MISS THIS?
miss KNOWING WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU DAY TO DAY?
it's UNDERSTANDABLE.
you WERE MADE FROM EDWARD. YOU'RE PART OF HIM.
no, NO. THAT--THAT PSYCHOPATH JUST LOCKED ME IN AN ABANDONED SHIP WITH AN ASSASSIN.
but YOU GOT OUT.
I've BEEN YOUR THERAPIST FOR TEN YEARS,
and I CAN SAFELY SAY TWO MONTHS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE DIED ON THAT SHIP.
Ah, COME ON.
Henry, YOU'RE CHANGING, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
you DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME.
what ARE YOU SO AFRAID OF?
Edward's NOT THE MONSTER YOU THINK HE IS.
edward LURED HIM TO THE UNITED STATES.
maybe YOU DIDN'T TAKE HIM DOWN, BUT THE C. I.A. DID.
trust ME, I KNOW EDWARD'S BY NO MEANS A PERFECT MAN, BUT...
I'll LET THAT LAST COMMENT SLIDE BECAUSE, SOMEHOW, I'M STILL ALIVE.
it's TIME WE FIGURED OUT A CODE WORD, DON'T YOU THINK?
Yeah.
Tony's TEAM SCOURED SHAW'S FILES AND FOUND FIVE PROBABLE LOCATIONS FOR HIS NEXT ATTACK.
we've ALREADY RECOVERED ONE BOMB EN ROUTE TO THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN ANKARA
in A DIPLOMATIC POUCH.
so THERE'S STILL FOUR DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE REMAINING BOMBS.
they're ALL PLACES SHAW WARNED US WOULD BE VULNERABLE
when HE WAS GLOBAL SECURITY DIRECTOR AT D. O.D.
I WANT A TWO-MAN TEAM IN EACH LOCATION.
you TWO WILL GO TO THE AMERICAN SCHOOL IN DUBAI,
and WE'LL COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM HERE.
will's UP IN 30.
I NEED YOU TO FLY SOLO ON DUBAI.
no WAY. I'M NOT ASKING.
I NEED TIME OFF THE GRID, AND I NEED IT NOW.
the ONLY REASON I'M AWAKE IS FOR THE MISSION,
and I GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
cause IF I DON'T, TWO GUY WILL PUT A BULLET IN TOM'S HEAD.
his FAMILY TOO.
you're GOING SOFT ON THEM.
unlike YOU, I DON'T BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE SHOU DIE FOR MY MISTAKES.
take IT UP WITH MAVIS. - LOOK,
these GUYS WHO FOUND ME...
I STOLE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THEM A LONG TIME AGO.
I KILLED A FRIEND OF THEIRS.
Yeah.
you JOINED JANUS TO AVENGE YOUR PAST?
I EDED TO ESCAPE MINE.
and, AS YOU KNOW...
Janus DOESN'T TAKE TOO KIND TO CRIMINALS.
fine.
Thanks, PAL.
I'm ON THE PREMISES.
copy, AVENGER.
boy SCOUT?
his COMMS WENT DOWN IN TRANSIT.

u. S. INTELLIGENCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
this BUILDING, THIS SCHOOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EVACUATED THIS MORNING.
the POLICE SAID IT WAS CLEAR.
they CALLED US BACK AN HOUR AGO. - THERE'S BE A MISCOMMUNICATION.

evacuation PROCEDURES FOR THE SCHOOL ARE HANDLED JOINTLY BY THE U. S. EMBASS AND THE DUBAI POLICE FORCE.
we SOUND THE ALARM. THEY DO THE CLEANUP.
when D. P.F.'s BOMB SQUAD CLEARED THE SCHOOL,
they CALLED IT BACK INTO SESSI WITHOUT OUR GO-AHEAD.
get THEM ON THE PHONE.
this IS EXACTLY WHAT SHAW ANTICIPATED.
finding LOOPHOLES LIKE THIS WAS HIS JOB.
well, LET'S FIND HIM.
okay...
there ARE THREE LOCATIONS WITHIN THE SCHOOL
where THE DIRTY BO CAN INFLICT THE MOST DAMAGE.
lead THE WAY, TONY. WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
Raymond CARTER RISES FROM THE GRAVE.
Greene TOLD ME, BUT THIS I HAD TO SEE FOR MYSELF.
it's BEEN A LONG TIME, LEO.
no MORE GAMES, TOM.
well, YOU'VE REALLY DONE WELL FOR YOURSELF, HAVEN'T YOU?
wife, KIDS.
basketball HOOP.
you GOT THE WHOLE DEAL, DON'T YOU?
What'd YOU DO, TURN STATES?
get INTO SOME KIND OF WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM?
somethin' LIKE THAT.
case YOU'RE WONDERING...
the ONLY REASON YOU'RE NOT DEAD YET
is BECAUSE I WAN MY MONEY BACK...
with INTEREST, OF COURSE.
of COURSE.
you GET ME THAT,
and GREENE'LL ONLY KILL YOU.
if YOU DON'T,
he'll DO YOUR WIFE TOO.
possibly THE KIDS.
we'll PLAY THAT ONE BY EAR.
I GOT YOUR MONEY.
well, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
not HERE.
you KNOW, YMOND-- - IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET IT, LEO.
fine.
Griffith PARK.
at 10: 00.
Shaw's MOST LIKELY TARGET IS THE ASSEMBLY ROOM.
it's IN THE CENTER OF THE SCHOOL
and WOULD MAXIMIZE CASUALTIES AS WELL AS MAKE A STATEMENT.
what ARE YOU DOING?
let's GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
the MAN SAID I NEED TO STAND HERE.
what MAN?
the BOY STAYS. AH AH!
I'll SHOOT HIM FIRST.
toss THE WEAPON...AWAY.
avenge WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?
let THE BOY GO, SHAW.
we GOT SHAW.
reroute ALL OF OUR RESOURCES TO DUBAI, IMMEDIATELY.
okay, NOW,
I CAN BE OUT OF HERE IN SEVEN MINUTES.
but I DON'T THINK ALL THOSE KIDS CAN.
so...
TOSS...THE GUN...DOWN!
okay, OKAY. IT'S GOING DOWN.
there IT IS. YOU SEE?
you HAVE EXACTLY THREE SECOND-UHH
to TELL ME WHERE THE BOMB IS.
Uhh! OH, CRAP.
the SCHOOL IS FULLY EVACUATED.
but IF THAT BOMB GOES OFF,
the RADIATION IS STILL GONNA TAKE OUT THOUSANDS OF THEM.
avenger, HAVE YOU LOCATED THE BOMB?
avenger, DO YOU READ ME?
listen TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.
if YOU DO NOT FIND THE LOCATION OF THIS BOMB AND DISENGAGE IT,
thousands OF PEOPLE WILL DIE OF RADIATION POISONING.
you ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS.
no ONE IS COMING TO HELP YOU.
no ONE CAN GET TO YOU IN TIME.
avenger, YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING NOW.
now, WHERE IS THE BOMB?
tell ME, OR I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL KILL YOU!
seat 5-A.
u. S. INTELLIGENCE!
D. P.S. BOMB SQUAD. DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?
seat 5-A.
this IS AVENGER.
we GOT THE BOMB.
good WORK.
good WORK, EVERYBODY.
okay...
I JUST GOT CONFIRMATION FROM THE DUBAI POLICE FORCE.
the BOMB IS SAFELY OFF-SITE.
they ARE DEFUSING IT NOW,
and THE RADIATION WILL BE CONTAINED.
good JOB, EVERYBODY.
Hey, I JUST GOT HOME. WHERE ARE YOU?
I'll BE THERE SOON. I RAN TO THE STORE FOR SOME ICE CREAM.
you WANT ANYTHING?
uh, NO, I'M GOOD. - YOU SURE?
Yeah. THANKS.
I'll SEE YOU SOON.
onstar CENTER. - THIS IS TRINA.
how MAY I HELP YOU?
uh, HI, THIS IS MARY GRADY.
um, HEH, I'M SO EMBARRASSED.
but I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE I LEFT MY CAR LAST NIGHT.
no PROBLEM, MRS. GRADY.
I SEE YOU'RE CALLING FROM YOUR HOME LINE,
so WE VERIFIED YOUR IDENTITY.
I'll BE HAPPY TO LOCATE THE VEHICLE FOR YOU.
can YOU GIVE ME THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER, PLEASE?
Yes, IT IS 2BRI 564.
it WILL JUST BE A MOMENT WHILE WE LOCATE THE VEHICLE.
Thanks.
What'd YOU FIND?
okay, I LOOKED AT THE FINAL THREE SECONDS OF THE EXPERIMENT AT LEAST 100 TIMES.
and THEN I SLOWED IT DOWN...
and SAW THIS.
you SEE, EDWARD WOKE UP.
and THEN HENRY, AND THEN EDWARD.
I MEAN, THEY WERE SWITCHING BACK AND FORTH SO FAST,
looked LIKE THE WHOLE BRAIN WAS ACTIVE.
you KNOW, IT WAS JUST BY CHANCE WE ENDED UP WITH HENRY.
if WE WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE E. C.T. A MOMENT LATER,
we WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH EDWARD.
so WE CAN CHOOSE WHO TO WAKE UP?
Yes! YES, IT WORKS.
it CAN ALL GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS.
well, I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D SHOW.
thought YOU'D RUN, LIKE LAST TIME.
I'm NOT THE GUY I USED TO BE.
I DON'T RUN ANYMORE, NOT FROM GUYS LIKE YOU.
open YOUR JACKET.
is THAT MY MONEY?
it's EVERYTHING I OWE YOU.
it's EMPTY.
what?
you KNOW, YOUR MISTAKES ARE ALWAYS GETTING OTHER PEOPLE KILLED.
it's TOO BAD. I LIKED YOUR WIFE.
she HAD A TON OF BALLS.
after ALL THESE YEARS, YOU STILL DON'T CARRY A GUN.
do YOU, LEO?
Yeah, THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH GUYS LIKE YOU.
you NEVER WANNA GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY.
why DON'T WE JUST FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING?
consider IT FORGOTTEN.
walk WITH ME, HENRY.
you REALLY PROVED YOURSELF OUT THERE.
edward COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT BETTER.
whew, THANK YOU.
however, WE WON'T BE NEEDING YOU ANYMORE.
what, ARE YOU GONNA KILL ME?
no, HENRY.
we're GONNA FIX YOU.
but THAT EXPERIMENT DIDN'T WORK.
Tony's FOUND A WAY.
well, UH, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE HAPPIER.
me TOO, I JUST...
there WAS SOMETHING IN ME THAT I'D NEVER FELT BEFORE.
I MEAN, IT SCARED ME, BUT IT'S THERE, IT'S REAL.
maybe IT'S BETTER TO GET TO KNOW THE MONSTER THAN TO PRETEND IT DOESN'T EXIST.
I'm NOT SURE I WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE.
I DON'T WANT AN ARTIFICIAL LIFE.
I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE TOM.
I DON'T WANT YOU PEOPLE DECIDING THE KIND OF MOOD
I'm GONNA BE IN WHEN I COME HOME TO MY WIFE
or WHAT I'M GONNA SAY, HOW I'M GONNA FEEL.
ANGIE...SHE DESERVES MORE THAN THAT.
HENRY...I'M SORRY I GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU HAD A CHOICE IN ALL THIS.
cause YOU DON'T.
your VERY EXISTENCE IS A RISK TO NATIONAL SECURITY.
this ENDS...TONIGHT.
Tony's WAITING.
Tony, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
Oh, MY GOD.
how COULD THIS HAPPEN?
nobody COULD GET IN HERE!
unless THEY WORK FOR THE COMPANY.
you THINK SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE DITHIS?
Yes.
and THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO BE FIXED.
Christian. Come on.
don't call me again.
you have to tell her now, because any male she comes in contact with could be in mortal danger.
they have no idea what your tea is doing to them.
what's with the whole "we" and "they" thing?
welcome to suburbia, where everyone uses their perfectly manicured nails to scratch each other's eyes out.
I'll need a vial of your blood - For the spell, of course.
you see, gentlemen, everyone has secrets that need protecting.
Nick, help me. Nick.
Nick, help me.
I'm sorry, nick, but we can't let you leave.
what do you mean?
come on, claire. It'll be fun.
I'm having it catered by that spanish place.
there'll be tapas, sangria.
it's really important to me.
good.
I will see you around noon.
seems like your little housewarmingpool party is shaping up to be quite an event.
well, I just hope everyone gets along.
this place can be so cliquey sometimes.
it's like karen won't talk to claire.
Devon won't talk to vanessa. It's like a whole...
do I sense an ulterior motive?
Yeah, stop detecting. I'm inviting lots of people.
hey... Did you get any sleep?
you had nightmares again, huh?
I'm fine.
this job was supposed to be less stressful than chicago.
I'm fine.
and I got to go.
eyes ope always wear your vest. Call for backup. I love you.
I love you, too.
Claire, just go to the party and try not to let karen crezski get under your skin.
Karen and her lot.
there is nothing worse than that rancid dog smell.
all right, well, just go. Play nice. We need to be normal right now.
what, right away?
how clandestine.
isn't this a bit paranoid?
you saw buckley's home movies. You ask me, we haven't been paranoid enough.
what do you propose we do about it?
he's got something on us. I say we get something on him.
make it an even playing field.
check that out.
w. r.Harrison, the developer who co-founded the gates with buckley.
that's before my time.
Harrison dies a few years after the gates opens.
falls down some stairs.
but right here... Coroner's inquest.
something about it. It's a little too - it's a little too neat.
vague suspicions of murder - That's not enough to go on, is it?
so we dig.
Dylan, we dig till we get something better. You're on the gates board.
that gives you access to bank statements, to contracts.
right?
plus... Dylan... You have your community.
well, hold on. Buckley is not a vampire.
and if I start digging around the board, buckley will find out.
look, it's a risk we take.
otherwise, we got buckley's threats hanging over our heads for the rest of our lives.
you want that?
all right. All right. I'm in. I'm in.
all right. I'll be touch.
Hey, Dr. Peg.
Yeah, look, I'm - Look, I'm sorry to call you on vacation, it's just I'm getting some nasty side effects from those pills.
keep taking them till you get back?
I don't know if I handle can.
I - I don't know if I can handle that.
okay.
Bye.
I've been looking for you.
I'm late for class.
Andie, I-I just want to know why you're avoiding me.
and - I thought we had something, and things got weird the other night, - and now you're just... - You wouldn't understand.
try me.
I can't.
beastlyboy.
you're exactly what I've been looking for.
chief monohan.
what an unexpected pleasure.
here for our men's facial?
a little massage?
uh, actually I wanted to ask you a few questions about your ex-husband.
please tell me he's in lots and lots of trouble.
that's him. W.r. Harrison.
he was a friend of my father's.
he didn't have any children of his own, so... He sort of doted on me.
I introduced him to frank, back when I still had no idea what kind of man my husband really was.
Frank had big dreams but small pockets and no connections.
that's where uncle billy came in.
that's what I used to call him.
so, how would you describe the relationship between frank and Mr. Harrison?
did they get along?
you're fishing.
what are you trying to catch?
what's out there?
I can tell you this.
Frank and uncle billy had a huge falling out right before he died.
looking back, I think maybe uncle billy learned about frank and vanessa's affair.
things between them got... Ugly.
and then uncle billy had his accident, and frank got everything he wanted.
full control over the gates and 100% of the profits.
nobody found that suspicious?
uncle billy had a bad hip, and I was young and naive.
by the time I found out what frank was capable of...
well, who'd listen to the ravings of a scorned woman?
Oh, you brought a quiche.
are you okay?
Yes, I'm... Perfect.
thank you so much for coming.
this really does mean a lot to me.
Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.
although I may not stay long.
I'm a little bit sensitive to the sun, and I'm afraid I don't swim.
well, ally?
have you seen some of the outfits?
because trust me, none of these women are going anywhere near the water.
Hey, leigh! You came.
Yeah, and I brought margaritas.
figured you'd need 'em.
well, I'm so glad.
I didn't think you'd be into this sort of thing.
watching stressed-out trophy wives get catty with underfed divorcs?
who doesn't love that?
Yeah, I was kind of hoping this party would bring people together.
what a beautiful backyard.
I brought venison.
Dacia, let's start up the grill.
I should get out of the sun.
you invited claire radcliff and karen crezski to the same party?
yeah?
Oh, this is gonna be good.
so, what'd you dig up on buckley?
okay.
look, devon may think buckley killed harrison to get control of the gates' profits, okay, but the numbers don't add up.
if anything, buckley is underpaid for his position.
it's - It's all very proper.
these are public records?
no, better than that.
I paid a visit to buckley's c. f.o.lloyd foster.
now, he's been here since day one.
the lion's share of the profits from the gates, they don't go to buckley, they don't go to devon, they don't go to anyone else.
instead, 80% ends up here... The gates trust.
so, killing harrison doesn't free up a penny for devon or buckley.
no. No motive, no murder.
well, at least that's what they say on "castle.
what if it's not about money?
Devon said harrison and buckley had a falling out before he died.
what if... What if buckley kills harrison over anger?
well, how do we prove that?
guy's been here since the beginning, right?
maybe he has some insight.
Hey, andie, are you okay?
I- I-i'm fine.
you're not fine. You're acting strange.
look, I told you, I - I'm fine.
we're not together anymore.
leave me alone.
venison?
bloody rare - Just the way you like it.
you're in an interesting mood.
full moon?
okay, can you explain that?
some things are beyond explanation.
it's a nice effort.
I can't remember the last time anyone brought those two and their friends together.
so, how are you?
is the gates everything you've been hoping for?
Yeah. No, this place is amazing.
it's just the... ...people need a little work.
I'll be right back.
okay.
you know, she doesn't bite.
I'll take your word for it.
look, claire... I may be pushing.
I do that.
and to be honest, when I first met karen, I really didn't like her that much, either.
but she's a good person.
just go over there and break the ice.
for me.
I will say hello.
I'll be cordial.
but if she's starts with any of her usual nonsense...
you are the best. Thank you.
look!
all my favorite ladies in one place.
you invited devon?
yeah?
it's hot today. Who's ready to jump in the water?
I appreciate what you're trying to do here.
but I have to go. I can't do this.
a
I understand harrison and buckley had a, uh - A disagreement before harrison died.
was it over the affair with vanessa?
that's the rumor.
see, harrison was very fond of devon, so if he learned that buckley had been unfaithful...
apocalyptic. - It's must've gotten ugly.
whatever the issue, harrison was so distressed, he threatened to shut down the gates.
he could do that?
he had me working on the details.
and then... - And then harrison died.
so sad, the way they found him.
facedown at the bottom of a staircase.
Lloyd, I'm gonna need access to the records from that year.
a copy of harrison's will.
Absolutely.
I'm telling you, dating in the internet era is a revelation.
I get 100 messages a day.
eliminate the losers, there's still dozens of handsome, successful men who'd kill to meet me.
Karen, darling. You should give it a whirl.
no need to grow old sad and alone.
something wrong?
nothing. It's just this entire party was a huge mistake.
I just want everyone to get along.
that's because you're sweet.
you know, nick came into my shop today.
he was aing about frank. So mysterious.
well, I'm sure he had his reasons.
but what were they? That's the question.
what cookie jar did frank stick his grubby hands into this time?
and more to the point, is he going to get caught... For once?
well, nick doesn't really talk to me about his cases.
and if he did, you wouldn't say anything, right?
confidentiality.
I almost forgot.
I brought you something.
my special tea.
a lile calm in a difficult day.
last chance. Anyone?
venison?
isn't that a little... Obvious?
suit yourself.
so, you found this company in the gates' records?
and this rivertrace land management
it gets paid directly from harrison's estate?
Yeah. A quarter mil a month.
there's a codicil added to harrison's will requiring the payments.
it was added a week before harrison died.
this doesn't look like any office of buckley's.
it's abandoned.
not exactly.
well, it looks like the only thing this place does is drain money from harrison's estate.
it's a rent receipt.
payment by wire transfer from a numbered account in the dutch antilles.
this is shell company 101.
I've seen this before. - What?
I've, um... Done this before.
broken into an empty office of a non-existent company?
no. Set up an empty office for a non-existent company.
my, um...My people, they, uh - They tend to outlive their identities, so...
every decade or so, we have to reinvent ourselves.
new name. New town. New birth certificate.
otherwise, you never age.
people become suspicious.
exactly.
and when one's garnered a certain amount of wealth, one prefers to retain it, and... So... Empty offices, shell companies, codicils to wills.
which raises a very uncomfortable question.
if we're trying to prove that buckley killed harrison...
what if harrison isn't dead?
and instead, he's funneling his own money to himself?
right.
what if harrison is like you?
we should meet.
Absolutely.
let's talk on the phone.
what's your number?
Devon, you left your bowl at my house when
Oh, sorry. You're busy. I'm gonna...
don't be silly.
let's sit. We'll have some tea.
I love this tea. I can't get enough of it.
that's because of the secret ingredient.
sorry if I ruined your party.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous. I'm sorry.
you were the one that got thrown in the pool.
no, my party was doomed from the start.
I swear, devon, I'm never gonna understand this place.
it's the mysteries that make life interesting.
speaking of which...
any news on nick's little investigation into my pig of an ex-husband?
Yeah, you know I can't really talk about that.
Oh, but of course you can.
it's just the two of us.
you simply have to tell me everything.
Nick asked me to look at the gates' books and also harrison's will.
I found all sorts of strange things.
go on.
in harrison's will, the first thing I noticed was a clause added right before he died.
thanks for the tea.
forget all about it.
Hello, is this "beastlyboy"?
you have such a nice voice.
I can't wait to meet you.
no. Andie. Come on.
no, andie, wait.
I said go away!
you can't avoid me forever. - Brett, go away.
I don't want to talk to you. no!
leave her alone. - You don't know what you're doing.
I said back off.
stop it.
Brett, no.
stop!
you happy now?
Charlie. No. No.
I have to go.
how did I get so lucky?
someone like you with a mutt like me.
I picked you because you're not like the other boys.
you're different.
I don't know about that.
don't worry.
different" is exactly what I'm looking for.
you can show your true self to me.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Yeah, well, we're doing this.
don't we need a court order or something to exhume a body?
and a backhoe.
why I have you.
look, we need to know if harrison's dead or alive, right?
and the only way to do that... Is to dig.
so we dig.
all right, allow me.
fine.
check the right hip socket.
that hip was replaced.
Yeah, it's artificial.
it's harrison.
well, so much to my theory.
you know what?
turn his head over for a minute.
I want to check something.
you serious?
thought you'd be oka with dead things.
right there - You see that?
the impact wound on the skull.
that doesn't happen from falling down a flight of stairs.
this, my friend, is no accident.
anything you want to tell me?
I smelled you when you came in the door.
I smelled you.
I can explain.
I am working very hard to keep a promise that I made to you.
so whatever it is that you are doing... - I'm protecting our family.
buckley is blackmailing me.
that woman I killed to save nick, he got it all on video.
he saw you?
Yeah.
he showed the recording to me and nick.
well, what does he want?
money?
we have money.
he wants silence... Cooperation.
but listen, nick and I - We have a plan.
we're - we're getting the dirt on buckley, leverage
leverage?
Frank buckley... ...the man who welcomed us here with open arms, caught you murdering a woman inside the gates...
and all he's asking is that you follow the rules?
Claire... - And you want to fight him?
Dylan, I don't understand.
you're always the one who's saying,"think of us. Think of emily. Imagine the consequences.
you might want to heed your own advice.
try to put an end to this.
hurry up, slowpoke.
you'll miss the first bell.
that was sort of my goal.
a real shiner.
I told my mom I ran into a door.
I don't think she believed me.
you don't have to lie about what you did.
it was cool.
I got my ass kicked.
and that's not even the worst part.
I was trying to protect andie, but she acted like I did something wrong.
I don't get her.
look, I don't know what's going on with andie lately, but I know she cares about you.
so don't give up.
if you say so.
I definitely say so.
Hey, dylan, it's nick.
look, why don't you come down to my office?
Nick, I'm out.
what do you mean, you're "out"?
we agreed. - It's just too risky.
I think you're making a mistake.
or maybe he's the rational one and you're making the mistake.
I'll call you back.
this investigation of yours... It needs to stop.
you're trying to blackmail me and dylan.
what I'm doing isn't blackmail.
it's an intervention.
you both made serious missteps, and you need to know that you can't get away with that sort of thing here.
when are you gonna wake up and realize you have a good thing here?
and stop screwing it up.
is that what harrison was doing... Screwing it up?
Harrison? What are you talking about?
you talk about helping people, protecting what you built.
I think you murdered harrison.
I think you bludgeoned a feeble old man to death in his own home.
y - you think I killed harrison?
he was like a father to me.
everything I am today, I owe to him.
I could never have hurt him.
I know he was trying to close the gates.
he was angry.
he was confused, but... He was no threat to anyone.
even if I believe you didn't do it...
somebody murdered your friend, your mentor.
do you want to see justice?
of course I do.
I'm gonna have my people talk to my... - no.
no. Let me do my job.
normally, i'm not big on baths, c that's because you don't have to pretend with me.
you can just be who and what you are.
I've been looking for someone like you for a long, long time.
somehow I doubt you have trouble getting anything you put your mind to.
you'd be surprised.
my life has been a series of disappointments.
people have hurt me.
well, anyone that hurt you...you just point me in the right direction.
I know how to make problems go away.
you're sweet.
not very subtle, but sweet.
though, there is a way you can help me.
just tell me what to do.
more bubbles?
it's not so much what you can do.
it's... What you can give.
what I need from you are your eyes.
Dylan, are you home?
Hi, you know who this is. And you know what to do.
Christian, this has to stop - The phone calls, the flowers - Everything!
Karen. You can't come in here.
I don't need permission to enter a house, unlike some people.
what happened?
please leave.
why do we act like this with each other?
just go.
I can't.
it's sarah. She's in trouble.
she's been drinking devon's tea.
I think it's starting to have an effect.
what do you suggest we do?
first... I help you clean this up.
and then we talk to her.
gether.
Oh, guys, this is so nice.
I knew if you just spent some time together, you guys would get along.
sometimes it takes an outside point of view to spot the obvious.
it's good to have someone like you in the gates, sarah.
someone without the prejudice that the rest of us carry around.
still, um... We do have a confession to make.
this isn't entirely social.
Sarah, have long have you been drinking devon's tea?
well, uh, pretty much since I got here.
it's so relaxing. It's great.
it's like having two glasses of wine without the hangover.
and I imagine that it probably works better now than when she first gave it to you?
well, yeah. That's - That's true, but...
Sarah, what we're saying is...
things that seem too good to be true usually are, especially when they involve devon.
I can't go too deep into it, lloyd, but there were no signs of forced entry.
had to be someone harrison trusted.
like buckley.
exactly.
what I need from you is the why.
you put together all the finances and show how the payments from harrison's estate were funneled into rivertrace management.
I - I'll do everything I can.
good. Thank you, lloyd.
trust me, you help me solve harrison's murder - You're gonna be a hero.
Brett. Please.
no, listen to me for two minutes, and if you don't like what I have to say,
I swear I'll never speak to you again.
two minutes.
I finally understand you.
I know you think I don't, and at first, I had no clue.
but now... I get it.
Brett, I... - No, I get it, andie.
I get that everything going on with you is happening because you're different.
different in a way you think no one else could ever understand, but I do.
I understand.
I understand because I'm not human.
you're not alone, andie.
you never have to feel alone again.
it started with my mom.
right on cue, lloyd.
gotcha.
uh, I-I can explain.
it's you.
you're the one.
you changed harrison's will, and then you killed him.
it's been you all along.
d
never leave well enough alone.
I brought this to clear up some loose ends.
Freeze!
gun on the ground! On the ground!
get on your knees. Get on your knees.
hands behind your head against the desk.
you set me up.
I set you up?
facedown at the bottom of the stairs.
those crime-scene photos were never released.
you gave yourself away, you idiot.
you're welcome.
coming through.
no, wait.
wait.
give me a minute.
could've let me die. Then you would have been free of this place.
the thought crossed my mind.
go.
I won't try to stop you.
let's load him up.
I'm just - I'm just wrapping things up now.
uh, i'll call you back.
okay.
Mrs. Buckley. What can I do for you?
I just came from the hospital.
Frank asked me to stop by.
he says you're planning to leave the gates.
well, i'm thinking about it.
that's a shame.
Frank spent a long time looking for someone like you, someone who'd fit in here.
I think he found the right man.
this place isn't - isn't what I expected it to be.
you're afraid of the gates, of dylan and claire and the rest, because of one word - Vampires.
but sarah and claire, they're friends.
and dylan risked everything for u.
so what if they're not monsters?
what if they're just people with unique differences and difficult histories who need your help?
what if the gates isn't a trap?
what if it's a calling?
what if this is where you're meant to be?
okay.
if the gates is such a wonderful place to live, then why all the secrets?
what is frank trying to protect?
me.
he's protecting me.
I'm the reason frank fought harrison's plan to close the gates.
and the reason frank works so hard for our special residents.
because I'm one of them.
I'm a vampire.
the truth is, everything that frank has ever done for the gates, he's done out of love.
that's the real secret of this place.
love.
isn't this place charming?
as advertised, but you didn't invite me here for the charm or the ice cream. - We can't just have ice cream?
we can, but not in this instance.
okay, I have a problem.
well, first of all, your mom's got a lot on her plate, and I think she's doing an outstanding job considering...
it's not about Mom.
it's about my teacher.
it's like she's made it her mission in life to keep me from ever graduating.
turn that thing off. - But what if it's important?
choose.
look, here's the problem.
she's notorious for being harder on the girls, but when she found out I was from a family of cops...
look, I should really check it. - Choose.
grandpa... - How would you feel if I was constantly interrupting?
deputy Commissioner Moore just walked in.
a cop's been shot.
who and where?
north End bus yard, multiple precincts rolled, but radio chatter's not clear on a name, how bad they're hit.
we've got conflicting descriptions of perps and direction of flight.
tell me something we do know.
Whoever' s down is a detective out of Danny's precinct.
this is Detective Reagan.
leave a message.
Hey, Danny, it's me, give me a call. Let me know everything's okay.
Hey, voice mail again?
Yeah, third time. You heard anything new?
lady called 911, said she was out walking her dog, heard yelling from behind a fence.
someone being accused of being a cop. Shots fired.
there's still no name? - Only that he was rushed to St. Benjamin' s.
a couple of guys are headed over.
all right, I'm gonna ask the boss if we can, too, just in case, all right? - Okay, come on, there's got to be 15 detectives in the 5-4 squad.
odds are it isn't your brother.
Danny's wife. - No way she's heard anything.
unless she got the call.
Hey, Linda. - Jamie, it's not Danny.
he called you?
Yeah, in case I heard, but he's fine. He's working a case in Murray Hill, and he said he was gonna call your dad as soon as he hung up with me.
thank God. - Yeah, no kidding.
listen...
Hi, Mom! - Awesome!
Yeah, I'm picking the boys up right now, so could you call Erin and Henry?
you know, make sure they're not worried, too. - Yeah, they already are.
Thanks, Linda.
I'm glad it wasn't Danny. There, I said it.
I felt the same way. Danny's family.
steve Tomlin has one, too.
let's hope for the best.
Dino says Steve has been undercover for the last year, working his way up the chain of a drug operation run by Santo Castillo.
somebody made him.
word is, after Castillo shot him, Steve managed to put a slug in Castillo, who ran off.
tough cop.
gave him the Combat Cross in '09.
commissioner?
how's my officer?
um, I'm afraid he's gone. Three bullets, one through the carotid.
he lost too much blood by the time he arrived.
thank you, Doctor.
I'll need to talk to his wife.
Lorraine. Married to Steve for 22 years, tax accountant by trade.
they have a home in Staten Island.
Frank, she's here.
two daughters, Bella and Lucy, both in college.
Mrs. Tomlin?
I'm so sorry.
can I arrange to get Lucy and Bella home from school?
Oh, that, uh...
uh, yes.
um, thank you.
my department owes Steve a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service.
anything we can do to help, you only need to ask.
catch whoever murdered my husband.
we will do that.
tell me we got the son of a bitch.
wish I could. - That's not the answer I want to hear, Dino.
Yes, sir. Morning, Baker.
morning, sir.
Castillo was shot. That would've slowed him down.
he hasn't turned up in any E. R. in the tri-state. I've got the whole department out looking.
half of them are doing it on their own time. - Who'd you put with the family?
johnson and Garcia. They came up in the ranks together. - And on the case?
sergeant Gormley said he gave it to the best detective he's got.
on the ground! Get on the ground!
move it!
back away from that sink!
on the ground now!
turn around, get on the ground, put your hands behind your head!
Where's your boss? - Who?
you heard me. Castillo. - Yo, we're just cleaning crew.
yeah?
my cleaning lady keeps a bazooka, too.
still enough here to send you down the drain.
what's your name? - Ticky.
Ticky, you want a break? Give up the cop killer.
like he said, we don't know anything.
fine, you want to play stupid with me, get your hands up on the sink.
move! I got all the time in the world till you decide to wise up.
as far as I'm concerned, each one of you pulled the trigger on Steve Tomlin.
get them out of here.
Erin, that was impressive.
well, sometimes when you get the right witness, the whole case will fall into place.
well, I'll get her statement typed up and to the DA by lunch. - Great.
can you find the car? - Lady, can you give me some help?
sorry, I don't have any change.
I mean a different kind of help. - Tyler?
what? - Tyler Jeffries. I'm Nicky's mom.
uh, my-my name's not Tyler. - From Blessed Heart.
you came to our house for Nicky's birthday party last year. - I said I'm not him.
forget it. - Tyler, are you okay?
here we go, Erin. - Yeah, I'll be right there.
put him in interrogation.
this one in the radio room. Cuff the others to something solid.
don't let them talk to each other or so much as trade glances.
this goes real easy, fellas.
first one to give up Castillo wins the prize.
you get the radio room; I got the box. - Got it.
reagan, you want help?
no. - I got cops from a dozen precincts volunteering to turn the screws on these guys.
no, we're gonna get a crack at them first.
all right, listen, Steve kept me in the loop on this Castillo.
says his people are unusually loyal.
boss of the year? Great, I'm jealous.
well, I'm just saying, you might hit a brick wall.
then I'll drag his family in here.
if you can find them. Apparently he has a sister, but Castillo made her change her name so nobody could find her and use her against him in some way.
do you have any more words of encouragement here, Sarge, 'cause this level of optimism is really firing me up.
all right, just-just holler if you need help, all right?
if you hear any hollering, it won't be me. Open it up.
what are you doing?
homework. - Without being asked?
who are you and what have you done with my daughter?
how was your day?
weird.
you know that boy from your class, Tyler Jeffries?
Yeah. - What's his story?
funny.
super nice. He's not in my class anymore, though.
he and his mom moved, like, five months ago.
I guess Tyler was getting high and stuff, so his mom put him in boarding school upstate to straighten him out.
well, I don't think it worked. - What do you mean?
I ran into him today in Hell's Kitchen, and he looked messed up on drugs or homeless or both.
what? - Yeah, it took me a second to even recognize him.
Oh, my God.
but you helped him, right? - Well, he ran off before I could.
then we got to go find him.
well, I will call Child Services, and they will contact his mother.
come on, can we just go look for him?
relax, all right? I will handle it.
get him out of my face.
nothing? - Nothing.
none of my guys even so much as asked for a lawyer.
they just sat there smirking at me.
you? - Same.
so what's next? - Pot of coffee.
Yeah, I'll go make one. - Thanks.
how's it going?
don't ask. - Okay, so you want to give me a hand?
I'm kind of busy here, Sarge.
I need a witness to open Steve Tomlin's locker, collect his effects to give to his family.
okay, I'll get a box.
I always hate this more than the funeral.
a life interrupted and all. - Well, at least there's no bagpipes.
they always make me cry.
it's empty.
I talked to Steve yesterday before he started his tour, Sarge.
his locker was open and it was full.
his uniform was in there, there were papers everywhere and pictures.
somebody must've cleaned it out after he died. - But before we could find it.
who the hell's hiding what?
the number of cops lost in the line of duty since you've been on the job.
and now 23 since sitting behind this desk.
you want me to do a draft of your remarks for the service?
you ask me every time, Garrett. - And I'm gonna keep asking.
some things you can't delegate, even a piece of.
but you could take a look at it when I'm done.
not yet. Last night Sergeant Gormley went to collect Steve Tomlin's things, but somebody got there first. Locker was completely empty.
someone sanitized it.
and no way was it a civilian just waltzing in off the street.
I don't get it.
what's the big deal about a guy's locker? - What's in it. Or isn't.
any evidence of tampering goes right up the chain of command.
what, you think Castillo's got a mole in the 5-4? - That's the bad version.
I got a worse one: someone's covering for Tomlin.
we got a problem, Chief. - You sure this is a "we," Frank?
wouldn't it be better and quieter if the department dealt with this on the precinct level?
no.
thanks for coming, Uncle Jamie.
everything okay? Your text said it was "serious.
Yeah, it's about a friend of mine. - A friend?
no, really, he's a great kid. Name's Tyler.
he went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen - looking like he was on drugs. - Did he use when you knew him?
I know he smoked pot sometimes.
no, I don't. But if I did, and it'd help find Tyler, then I'd admit it.
so you want me to look for him. - Could you?
mom said it was around 35th and 10th.
that's a pretty sketchy area. - Yeah, I know.
here, that's what he looks like.
your mom know you want me to do this?
Yeah, she's really worried, too.
she would've been here, but she wanted to go talk to Child Services about him.
all right, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks, Uncle Jamie.
and this isn't just me saying it.
this comes straight from the commissioner:
someone in the 5 - 4 cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker "without authorization...
or knows who did.
which may very well be impeding the murder investigation of a brother in blue to each and every one of you. So let me be clear.
"if Detective Tomlin's belongings don't end up in my office by 24 hours, there'll be hell to pay for all of us."
so, folks, while the rest of us get back to finding this son of a bitch Castillo, one of you is gonna stand up and do the right thing.
you owe it to Steve.
that's all.
so, who do you think it is?
I don't want to believe anybody in this room could be capable of being Castillo's mole.
well, he found out Tomlin was undercover somehow.
well, maybe we'll get lucky and find it in all this data we gotta look through.
well, looks like TARU found a bunch of steamy text messages from one of our thug's cell phones.
which thug?
said it belonged to Ticky, the one who was dumping the coke earlier.
I grilled him. He didn't say squat.
well, it looks like he had a lot to say when he was texting this Vivian girl.
look who he says her brother is. - Castillo.
son of a bitch. - He was transported down to Central Booking.
let's get his ass back here now.
Ah, another day of crime-fighting.
we should get capes. - I should get a new partner.
so why did you ask the boss for this sector today?
a favor for my niece and sister.
a friend of Nicky's was in this area the other day looking kind of rough, so I said I'd look for him.
man, you do more for your family by 9: 00 a.m., than my family's done for each other our entire lives.
name's Tyler Jeffries, about five-foot-eight, he's 16. - I still don't got nothing to say. - Why don't you relax, Ticky?
why do they even call you Ticky, anyway?
is it because you're a leech on a big fish like Santo Castillo, is that it?
I like watches.
which is appropriate since your time's running out, unless you tell us where to find your boss.
yo, like I told you before, I don't know who you're talking about.
Really? - Even though you're banging his sister... what is, uh, Vivian?
say what?
say you right here in these text messages.
Viv, you were incredible last night as always." To which she replied...
keep it on the DL, baby. My bro will kill us if he finds out.
to which you replied... "U kidding? Santo heart me.
and I could kick, I could kick his ass anyway.
that's a different Santo.
hmm. - Really? Even though Vivian wrote back...
Santo only hearts his $ and his drugs.
watch yourself." - To which you replied...
I only wanna watch u, baby.
Oh, smooth talker, I'll give him that. - Yeah.
Yeah. Let's just hope he's smooth enough to talk Santo out of blowing his brains out.
okay, okay! So I been hooking up with his sister.
great. Now you can tell us where she lives. - I can't tell you.
you know one big difference between you and I?
is that I'm not afraid of your boss, unlike you.
in fact, when I see him, I'm pretty much gonna tell him that you told us everything. In fact, maybe I'll even show him this lovely little picture that his sister sent to you.
please, look, if I give him up, he's gonna have me killed.
her, too.
which means we're the only ones who can protect you, as long as you start talking.
Yep, so why don't you tell us where she lives?
now!
police! Open up!
you can't just walk in here.
yeah? Well, this says we can. Step aside. Step aside!
see how easy that works?
let's go! - Don't touch me!
come on. Tear this place apart. Let's go.
you can't just do that, all right? I know my rights.
Where's your brother, Vivian? - I don't have one.
Santo Castillo, you're his sister
Dolores, until he made you change your name to Vivian Vasquez.
what are you talking about? - Do you think we're stupid? He got shot up.
you're a nurse. Where else would he go?
maybe to his real sister, 'cause you got the wrong place.
so you all can kiss my ass! - Hey! Your brother's a cop killer.
and he's going down hard. And if you're harboring him, you're gonna go down just as hard, you understand?
and I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm the only one here.
hands where I can see 'em! - Is that right?
let me go! I didn't do nothing!
perp in custody! - You were saying?
come on, come on. He hid in the tub.
Yeah, real original.
hope you got clean, Castillo, 'cause that's the last shower you're gonna take by yourself for a long time.
Yeah, and if you think you're in a bad mood now, wait till you find out your sister's screwing the help.
what's he saying?
santo, I can explain. - You'll explain it to him later. Get him the hell out of here.
get him in the hallway.
take a look at 'em all, Castillo.
every cop in here wants to take a piece out of you. Open up.
I want my lawyer. - Won't do you any good. Next stop for you is a deep, dark hole.
Yeah, and on your way down, you can tell us who helped you set up Steve.
what?
your mole inside this precinct.
if that's what you think, you ain't never gonna figure out how I found out.
right.
giving up the cop who set up Steve is the only card you've got- tell your lawyer to play it.
let's go - I want to wash this dirtbag off my hands.
checking to see if Castillo's gonna give you up, Becker?
you're out of your mind. - What's your problem?
thought opening lockers was your specialty.
Steve's locker's right behind me.
that gives you plenty of opportunity to scope out his combination, or eavesdrop and see how close he's getting to Castillo.
listen, Detective...
the only thing I'm listening to, Becker, is you admit to it right now.
okay, fine, it was me.
I cleaned it out! - You Castillo's mole?
huh? - No, you got that wrong!
why'd you do it?!
Hey, beat it! Both of you, beat it now!
it's none of your damn business. - Start talking, Becker.
I just copped to it, Reagan.
but that's all I got to say.
and you understand the consequences of what you did?
possible grand larceny, possible criminal possession of stolen property, possible conspiracy in the murder of a police officer.
Yes, sir. - Yet you didn't ask for a lawyer or a union rep.
I don't need one, sir.
it was me who cleaned out Steve Tomlin's locker.
on a cop killer's orders?
at ease.
sit down.
what you did doesn't square with your record.
come on, Bill.
I know you're sitting on something.
six years ago...I was still on probation...and me and my training officer heard this bank heist call go over the air.
steve was already on the scene when we got there, and all of a sudden, these robbers burst out, guns blazing...
and...
I froze. - I assume this is going somewhere.
steve pushed me out of the way before I got my head blown off...and he took down both the perps.
he... He saved the day.
that night I bought all his drinks and... we became friends.
so you owed him?
what was he mixed up in?
steve was clean as a whistle, sir.
and - and this has nothing to do with the job.
then I know he wouldn't want you to blow up your career over this.
he has another family.
wait, so you saw Tyler?
Yeah. About a block down from where your mom saw him.
he was digging through a trash can. - Was he on drugs?
he didn't look good. - But, you - you took him home, right?
no. We never got the chance. He pushed Eddie pretty hard and then he ran.
we went after him, but... he was gone, just like that.
God. So, he's still out there? - Unfortunately, yeah, but I gave his photo to all the cars in the precinct and I'm gonna ask for the same assignment tomorrow, okay?
like hell you will. - Mom!
I was just telling Uncle Jamie about...
Yeah. I heard all about it. You sent him out looking?
just let me explain. - Wait. What?
I thought you said your mom knew about this?
would you both just listen to me?
look, I had to make sure Tyler got help before something bad happened.
so that justifies going behind my back?
and lying to me, Nicky? - I'm sorry.
but maybe if you didn't treat me like I'm still a little kid...
well, you just proved that you are, by ignoring me when I said I would take care of it.
so, did you? - I spoke to ACS, they've reached out to Tyler's mom, and I haven't heard back yet.
so now he's out there somewhere doing God knows what with God knows who.
the conversation's over.
if you don't eat your vegetables, no dessert.
delicious, as always.
you hardly ate.
I ate.
who made the potatoes? - Uh, I think it was Nicky.
better not say you didn't like 'em. - Loved 'em.
good and cheesy.
I'm surprised you found time to cook.
I managed. - Mm-hmm.
we missing something here?
feeling a little cold chill coming from this side of the table.
what's going on? - Nothing anyone needs to know about.
see, Francis? Hard enough having even one family some days.
boys, take your plates and go eat in the kitchen.
so you guys can have a conversation we're not supposed to hear?
that's exactly right, Jack. - Go on.
come on, I'll eat with you.
go easy on this, Pop. - I'm not going to pussyfoot around this.
what kind of cop has two families?
what? Who? The one that got killed?
Yeah. - Yeah, Steve Tomlin. He had a wife and two kids in Staten Island and a girlfriend with a newborn baby in Jersey.
and you didn't know?
steve is in your squad. - He was in my squad and I'm friendly with him, but pretty much nobody knew what was going on with him.
well, you know what, one of those women knew what was going on, - and it was probably the girlfriend. - So she doesn't deserve any sympathy?
he's the father of her kid. - No, that's not what I'm saying, Jamie.
maybe he was that good of a catch that they were happy to share him.
I personally just try to figure out where a man finds the time or energy - to carry on with two families. - You-you looking for some tips?
no, I'm not looking for tips. I'm just saying it's a mess.
which isn't over.
right, the funeral.
well, you can count me out. - And we will.
Oh, come on, Grandpa. We don't really know what was going on with Tomlin's life.
I mean, maybe he was making the best of a bad situation, you know?
you saying you excuse what he did?
no, I'm just saying I'm reserving judgment until the smoke clears a little.
exactly.
I got personal items for two different women.
some need to go to the girlfriend. - Mmm, kind of got to side with Gramps on this one.
thank you.
there's a line, and men know where it's drawn.
you're also the cop on the case.
well, then I'll deliver whatever I need to.
thank you, Danny. - You got it, Dad.
guess what sector we got this morning.
judging by the smile on your face, Restaurant Row.
back to Hell's Kitchen.
Really? - Boss says we did great.
15 summonses and a felony collar.
and I volunteered us since I know you want to find Tyler again.
says who?
your niece put you on the case. - Yeah, until my sister blew a gasket.
sergeant. - Come on, friend of Nicky's or not, that kid needs help.
so let's go find him again.
but he's not gonna be hanging around Hell's Kitchen. Not after he knows we're looking for him.
Yeah, I thought the same thing till I talked to a couple of guys in Narcotics who executed a warrant on a drug spot on that very same block this morning.
and guess who was seen running from the scene.
well, let's go look for Tyler.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.
he moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.
and now it's just us two.
I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.
issues?
did Steve stay home every night?
no, he was undercover. Had to be gone a lot.
did he wear a ring?
no, why would he? He was single.
detective, what - what are you saying?
I'm saying that Steve Tomlin was married.
no.
he had two kids. Both in their 20s.
no. You're wrong. He w... he was with me.
we were going to get married, just-just as soon as-as...as soon as...
I'm sorry.
regardless of whether or not he was married, it's obvious that he loved you.
you're defending him?
surprises me, too.
look, Steve could have abandoned the both of you, but he didn't.
in fact, you should probably take a look at this.
it was in his locker, too.
deferred compensation. - Kind of like a pension.
cop gets to choose who the beneficiaries are, and Steve chose the both of you.
so Angela will be taken care of?
I'm not sure if he filed it.
but it's obvious that he wanted the both of you to be taken care of.
do you think... he would've done that if he didn't love you very much?
police!
stop!
hold it right there. - Let me go. Please.
please let me go. Please.
Why? So you can go get high again? Aw, sorry, buddy, those days are over.
Yeah. Along with shoving police officers, which, by the way, is assault.
Hey. We tried this the easy way. Now you get the hard way.
you got anything sharp in your pockets, like a needle? Anything that's gonna stick me?
look, I-I don't do drugs. - Yeah, that's not what my niece says.
look, I, I was a screwup at school, okay?
but I stopped all that. I swear. - Yeah?
what were you passing around with your pals back there?
your report card with all As?
it was...
it was her photo.
to see if anyone's seen her.
"her" who, huh?
it's just a picture.
my mom...came down here a week ago to score and never came back home.
she's the junkie.
thanks for bringing these.
the girls'll be happy to know their father kept them so close.
I'm just trying to carry out what...I think he'd want.
steve was a hell of a cop, and I honor that.
it's all he ever wanted to be.
well, I'll be sure and say that when I stand up for him at the funeral.
and if there's anything else my department can do...
I only have to ask.
can I ask this?
could you please not lie to me, Commissioner?
Steve's lies were bad enough, but to have all of you parade around here with your sad smiles and your pats on the back for the poor widow...and nobody has the guts to admit what I've known for the past year?
I'm not sure I understand.
of course.
once I knew, I did what every good wife does.
blamed myself.
tried to make him love me again. I mean, I...I do love the guy.
and the only time I lost it was when I...I'd had too much to drink and I...I found his phone and I called the number I didn't recognize and I told the bitch off.
told her I was the one who had stuck by him all these years and raised his family while he was out on the job.
and I hung up the phone before she could get a word in edgewise.
I'm very sorry.
you know what you could do?
skip Steve's funeral.
just skip the nice speech about how honor is such a big part of the job.
how the NYPD appreciates the sacrifices made by the families.
you might be able to get the words out, but I, for one, don't want to hear them.
his real family doesn't want to hear it.
can you do that for me?
good-bye, Commissioner.
I've got good news. - I could use some.
corporation counsel reviewed Steve Tomlin's financials.
he filled out his deferred compensation papers but never submitted them, so they're invalid.
the Staten Island family will get all the money and benefits.
and how is that good news?
well, the last thing this office needs is legal wrangling with an irate widow.
or lurid headlines about a two-timing cop.
so it's good news for this office?
what about Marianna and their baby?
well, technically, they're not his family.
technically? - I don't blame them.
doesn't take a ring to make a family.
I tried to give you an out, Frank. But you chose to be mixed up in this.
I'm just telling you where we are. - On the high moral ground, apparently.
that's not fair. - None of this is.
that's no excuse to turn our backs on a woman with a cop's baby.
look, if you can figure a way to help out both families, I'm all ears.
as far as I see it, the department's hands are tied.
you really sure I should be here?
I called your mom to ask her, but she didn't answer, so...
no, I mean because I lied to you.
we're good, Nicky. And I think that Tyler could really use a friend right about now.
Tyler. Oh, my God, I thought you moved.
that's what I told everyone. So they wouldn't know the truth.
Tyler's mom has been having some problems.
what do you mean?
first it was prescription drugs.
then it became other stuff.
ms. Jeffries disappeared about a week ago.
Tyler's been out looking for her.
why didn't you let my mom help you? Or my uncle?
because then you'd find out, and... people at school.
but...
I guess they'll all find out anyway when it's in the papers that she's dead.
Tyler, we don't know that she is. - Then why can't I find her?
I've looked everywhere. - Because she's been in the hospital.
accidental OD. She's been a Jane Doe at Bellevue for a couple days.
is there any way I can see her? - That's why I'm here.
so you did keep looking for her.
and your uncle is on his way down from Rhode Island.
you'll stay with him until your mom gets clean.
thank you so much.
all of you.
we just did what she asked.
come on.
I want a cape.
Cheers.
Yeah.
I need a little help here, Pop. - Is this about that Tomlin fellow?
his second family needs to be taken care of.
wasn't that his job?
well, he got himself killed in the line of duty before he got around to it.
so throw him a 10-13 party.
there is a three-month-old baby girl who's gonna grow up without a father.
and the problem does not get solved by some cash in a cigar box on a bar.
where is everyone?
in here.
Oh. Are you here to help your old man muscle me into pitching in?
if that's what's going on, I am now.
come on, Pop.
you're on the board of the Policeman's Fund.
Yeah, so?
so it may be time to put some of that influence to good use, Gramps.
create a back-pocket pension for one more widow and orphan.
old dog, new tricks. - I haven't said yes.
you gonna say no?
so what's going on?
I went to see the girlfriend again to confirm that Tomlin's wife did in fact call her as she claimed.
wait a minute.
the wife called the girlfriend? - The wife thought she called the girlfriend.
she found a number in Tomlin's cell phone.
she called it, thinking it would be the girlfriend on the other end.
Tomlin was undercover in Castillo's gang.
and unfortunately...
she accidentally called one of them.
Yeah.
it was Tomlin's wife who blew his cover, Gramps.
couple days later, we got a dead cop.
you got to be kidding me.
if I was kidding, someone would be laughing.
good Lord.
she loses her husband and then has to hear this.
it'll kill the woman.
unless she doesn't hear it.
I can't lie to that woman again.
she has to know.
commissioner Reagan.
I need to talk to you, Mrs. Tomlin.
I've said everything I have to say.
well, I'm afraid I haven't.
I'm sorry, I got nothing for nobody.
I'm burying my husband tomorrow.
I didn't handle our meeting very well, yesterday, and I'm sorry.
but I think...Steve would've wanted the NYPD represented at his service.
I know he would.
and it would be my honor to do that for him.
you came all the way out here just to ask me that?
Yes, I did.
you were face-to-face with Carlos Fuentes, right?
so that means he knows that we're on to him.
tell me why they would ever return to this club.
you have one more night at Club Mayan. Make something happen.
this is Yasmin Aragon.
if we agree to drop her drug charges, she thinks she can get the Fuentes brothers in the club.
Hey.
I thought you might want a debriefing before we hit Club Mayan.
it's sort of not a good time. This is Stan Liddy.
you are boning our target's sister?
just tell me what you found out on Dexter Morgan.
you fucked everything up, Boyd.
Boyd Fowler. Hobbies:
Self-improvement... - Take it!
and storing women in formaldehyde.
every one of these barrels has a body in it.
Boyd wasn't the only one who did this to me. There were others.
I shot one of them.
Dexter, what do I do?
that last fucking bitch is alive.
they're gonna find you.
some experiences are so big they change your DNA.
I'm gonna have to find the rest of them, because that's the only way that I can feel this peace again.
I can't get revenge for Rita's death, but I can help Lumen avenge what was done to her.
how many more were there?
Hey. I brought food.
Oh.
have you eaten?
I ate this morning.
well, now it's night.
eat some more.
you're very...Controlling.
when I need to be.
so what else?
details would help.
besides the ones that we've already...
taken care of...
there was a watch guy.
"watch guy"?
I would be tied to a chair...
blindfolded.
sometimes I didn't even know if he was there until I'd hear this watch by my ear.
and then he'd lean in and whisper, "Tick, tick, tick."
that's the sound of your life running out.
okay. Anyone else?
suit and tie.
he'd take off his jacket and fold it very carefully and then lay it on a chair, like he didn't want to mess it up.
the suit guy I'd know.
he always took the blindfold off.
I guess he thought I'd be dead soon.
he was wrong.
so what do we do now? How do we find them?
I'm not sure "we" is the operating word here.
what are you talking about?
we're doing this together.
lumen, what I do, I do alone. I don't need a partner.
I said I'd help you, but...
fine. Forget it.
forget it?
there's no point to it then.
you want these men brought to justice.
Yeah, and I can't go to the cops because of you.
so you're gonna have to be a little flexible here.
I want to be a part of this.
we'll see.
gracias.
I need to get home to Harrison.
right.
the other part of your life.
there is no other part to Lumen's life.
this is all she has.
even so, I can't bring her into my world.
there's no place for her.
thank you.
I feel like I'm dropping off my prom date.
except this is my house and my wife is dead and I have no idea where Lumen fits into my world and this is all so weird.
exactly like my prom.
our level of national debt is unsustainable.
...where independent producers are weighed down by parasitic non-producers, a Democratic president and a Democratic congress.
you're just in time.
Hey, good night, buddy.
saint Brigid, circle us with your light so that no darkness shall overcome our world.
sleep well, little one.
that's either a Saint or the most boring action figure I've ever seen.
is that yours?
it's Saint Brigid.
to watch over you while you sleep.
good night. - Good night.
he doesn't need Saint Brigid.
he has father Dexter.
why are you up so early?
gym.
but how about it? You know?
I mean, we don't have to live here.
we could get a new place together.
Morgan.
I'm homicide. I don't do traffic accidents.
Wow. Uh, text me the address.
what's up?
dead people.
you're gonna get the same call. We're all getting called in.
why didn't you tell them I'm here?
because I'm not here.
basically, nobody knows we're seeing each other.
I just want to keep it that way.
wow, baby. You say the sweetest things.
can we at least drive in together?
Yeah, and then we'll go to Disney World and we'll ride all the roller coasters and we'll hold hands.
I don't even know what that means.
whatever it is...
it's big.
Hey, sergeant. What have we got?
you haven't been listening to the news?
weather channel. High-pressure system coming in.
what have we got?
we got her... And her...
and her... And her...
and her.
the girls in the barrels. How could this be?
someone tried to move them.
Where's the driver?
that's what we're trying to figure out. He took off.
go do your thing.
it's the blood guy, but we got no blood.
we don't know what we've got.
Yeah, what is this gunk?
it's formalin. Liquid formaldehyde.
Why? - An embalming agent.
because it was only applied topically, the internal organs of the cadavers continued to putrefy and leak out of the various bodily orifices, becoming congealed once they came in contact with the formalin.
that's what's on your shoe. Congealed organ.
what kind of sick fuck are we dealing with?
I'm just the blood guy.
we've got five victims.
all female, all blonde, all between the ages of 20 and 35, I'm guessing.
they're covered in bruises, contusions, whip marks.
looks like they went through some special kind of hell.
we'll get fingerprints off them once we get 'em to the M. E.'s office.
I heard the driver took off.
Yeah, we've got the guy that hit him. He was drunk off his freaking ass.
he said he saw some guy jump out and start running, but that's as detailed as his description gets. "Some guy."
that means he's still mine to find.
or Vince Masuka's.
Hey.
Hey, Dex.
that's some pretty crazy shit, huh?
Yeah, crazy shit. What do you got?
one men's suit jacket, size 40.
did you fold it or was it already like that?
I bagged it as I found it.
I also got fingerprints galore. - Excellent.
except for the steering wheel. Somebody gave it a quick wipe.
I'll get the vehicle back to the lab and we'll give it a more thorough going-over.
right.
so much for keeping my lives separate.
Yeah, what's up?
what you doing, boy? Sleeping late?
your buddy Dexter Morgan, you asked me to keep an eye on him.
yeah? And?
well, he's got some cutie up at his house.
he even took down the "for sale" sign.
what's this girl look like?
blonde, average height, late 20s.
slim, pretty?
that'd be her.
find out who she is. - You betcha.
come here. What are you doing here?
I saw the news.
I knew what it was. I had to come.
no, you didn't have to come.
Dexter, I was supposed to be one of those girls.
look, it's not safe for you here.
they could be watching.
what is this?
what does it mean?
it means they're on the run.
you need to go.
will you give me... Thank you.
shit a brick and fuck me with it.
you're never gonna guess who this truck is registered to.
jordan Chase is a very smart guy.
his first book made me realize how I'd been putting all these limitations on myself.
I mean, I've listened to all his CDs.
so did Boyd Fowler.
you think Jordan could have been driving that truck?
what? No way.
first off, that jacket is nice, but not that nice.
jordan wears nothing but the best.
that's part of his thing.
if you think you deserve something, then take it.
I've lifted two dozen fingerprints and they all seem to belong to the same person.
and whoever they belong to, he's not in the AFIS database.
dead end.
Ooh, a hair.
and another one.
it's not often I'm in competition with my own people, but getting the identity of the driver of the truck and getting to him before they do is the only way I can give Lumen what I promised.
all I get is a fucking computer.
I can order Jordan Chase books. I can order Jordan Chase CDs, but I can't talk to an actual person.
jordan Chase is a really popular man, you know?
he travels the world giving his little touchy-feely seminars. He's probably not even in Miami right now.
I've left messages all over.
if I don't hear back soon, I'm gonna kick their door in.
what about you? Anything?
Yeah, we've I. D.'d two of the girls off their fingerprints.
one was a schoolteacher from Wisconsin.
she came out here on vacation two years ago.
never heard from again.
the other one worked on a cruise ship that was docked here.
she disappeared just over a year ago.
Wow.
Yeah, these were good girls, you know?
one was 26, one was 29.
nothing on the other three?
no, I'm going through the missing person databases.
put their photographs out there.
DNA? - It's being run now.
looking for direct hits and familial hits.
listen. I heard about this two-bedroom place on Brickell.
upper unit, right on the water. Thought we could take a look.
this is not a workplace conversation, so please just shut up.
all I'm saying is, is this place is going fast.
listen, please, just not here.
you two...
now.
shit.
think she knows about us?
is this about... - The Santa Muerte case.
Oh.
I thought that was dead.
well, now it's alive. Barely.
Yasmin Aragon, the associate of the Fuentes brothers that sergeant Batista identified, has assured us that she will bring
Carlos and Marco into Club Mayan tomorrow night.
so we're on? - We are on.
I am personally overseeing this operation.
we can't risk word leaking out to the Fuentes, so it's strictly on a need-to-know basis.
rather than flooding the club with police personnel, we will be performing a small surgical operation.
we will take the brothers into custody before they get into the club.
detective Morgan, you'll be with me in the surveillance van.
detective Quinn, we're gonna post you inside the door of the club with officer Manzon.
I will be roving, placing myself wherever I believe most effective.
if we're gonna take them outside, shouldn't we be outside?
in order not to stand out like sore thumbs, we will continue with the posts we've already established.
thank you, detectives Morgan and Quinn. That'll be all.
let me make myself very clear.
you've wasted more than enough time and money on this case already.
you're supposed to be a master manipulator of the press, but you haven't even been able to do that.
every day I pick up the paper, read another story about how we're not doing our job.
get it right this time or we're gonna have an interesting conversation about your future.
where are we with Jordan Chase?
I've got Quinn on it.
we've made numerous calls to his organization, but we haven't been able to reach him personally just yet.
he could be playing hard to get.
in that case, we'll pay his office a visit to see if, uh...
probably won't be necessary.
jordan Chase.
Hi.
holy shit. That's him.
nice to meet you.
nice to meet you. - You too.
Mr. Chase? Oh, Mr. Chase.
stand back. - I, um... I, uh...
I took one of your seminars at the beach club a while back.
sure. In Palmetto Bay?
you remember?
of course I do.
you have to excuse Cole here. He, uh... he keeps the crazies away.
why don't you let me get a picture of you two?
Oh, yeah. Excellent. Okay. Okay.
all right. Smile.
one more.
got it.
jordan Chase.
nice to meet you.
Wow. Nice watch.
Oh, uh, my dad gave it to me when I was a teenager.
it's water-resistant to 100 meters.
I have no idea why I would ever need that, but it sure looks nice.
if that's the watch that Lumen heard,
I'll make sure it accompanies you to the bottom of the Atlantic.
Mr. Chase.
you must be the person in charge around here.
I was in Jacksonville.
got an early call from Cole here, my head of security, saying that one of our trucks had been stolen out of our lot and that it just might be the one we'd all been watching on the news.
I flew back as soon as I could.
I see.
we found an article of clothing in the vehicle.
my jacket. It's my personal vehicle.
I always leave my things inside.
and the keys? - The keys?
Yeah, we found the keys in the ignition.
there are a lot of ways to steal a car.
most thieves don't have the actual key.
I leave a spare set of keys on a hook inside our office.
all my guys know where to find them in case they need the truck.
honestly, they're just sitting there.
anyone could have grabbed them.
and you're head of security?
Yeah, Cole.
I might have to tighten things up a bit, hmm?
I want to make it very clear that the Miami Police Department has my full cooperation.
my organization is completely open to you.
this is a horrible, horrible tragedy.
please, anything I can do to help facilitate its resolution.
well, thank you, Mr. Chase.
first, we're gonna need fingerprints and hair samples from all your employees.
starting with Cole.
Absolutely. And if I could ask one favor?
I'd appreciate it if my name and organization wasn't released to the press.
being connected to this in any way would be a P. R. nightmare.
I'm sure you understand.
as long as we have your continued cooperation, that shouldn't be a problem.
sociopaths can't feel psychic pain, but they can feel physical pain.
Ow. - Sorry.
what do you think about Cole?
someone stole my vehicle.
the oldest excuse in the book.
still, it does happen.
and Mr. Chase is very high-profile, well respected.
it's hard to imagine someone like him or his people would be involved in something like this.
I took a few hairs from the headrest of the truck as well.
if someone else was driving, he'd have left some evidence behind.
And?
well, Cole's hair matches the hair on the jacket and the headrest.
fingerprints? - They're all Cole's. Even on the ignition key.
and Jordan?
his alibi holds up. He was in Jacksonville.
so for now, we got our eyes on Cole.
Dexter, you need to announce yourself.
I don't know who's coming in.
but it's okay to have packages delivered here?
I need things.
you said not to leave the house.
and what are you gonna do with that?
it's just a flashlight.
you have a way of bending the rules.
what's going on with the case?
do you know this man?
Oh, my God.
that's him.
that's the guy who folded his jacket. How did you find him?
he found us. His name's Cole Harmon.
he's Jordan Chase's head of security.
what about him?
no, I...
I mean, that guy's clearly a freak, but I don't know him.
no, not the bald guy. The guy beside him.
jordan Chase. - Oh.
no, I don't know him either. - You sure?
I told you, I didn't see most of their faces.
who is he?
he's some sort of motivational speaker.
this guy... I definitely know.
what next?
well, there's a problem. The homicide team is on this.
they'll probably arrest him within the next few days and once that happens, Cole will never see the outside of a prison cell again.
what about the other guys?
in order to save his own skin, he'll probably turn them in.
it's only a matter of time before they're all in the hands of the police.
but this is Florida. We execute here.
these men will be brought to justice.
you can walk away from all of this now, put it behind you.
you can go on with your life.
no.
that's not what I want.
I promise you the police will take care of it.
no, I don't want the police to take care of it. I...
I want to take care of it.
I know how she feels. It's not so different from me.
how much coffee are you drinking?
a lot.
I have to stay awake. What if they come for me at night?
she's stressed, on edge.
the way I feel when I've gone too long without putting someone on my table.
you said you'd help me.
I did. I just don't know that helping you kill someone is actually helping you.
this is all I think about.
don't back out now.
this is important to me.
truth is, I actually want to help her...
for some very complicated reasons.
if we want Cole for ourselves,
who?
the man who actually killed all those girls.
here. Put these on.
first thing we have to do is remove any evidence that you were ever here at Boyd's house.
if police find your fingerprints or...
anything that ties you to this place, they're gonna want to know what your relationship to Boyd Fowler is.
how you got here.
how you got out.
that's where you first found me.
we need to go up.
you okay?
I'll be with you.
Oh, God.
you okay? We can leave.
no.
he kept me tied up... Over there.
I don't know how long I was here.
maybe a couple days.
all I know is that he brought me here to kill me.
I'm guessing that was his job.
he was the finisher.
the last day, I chewed on that rope for hours.
I was finally able to slip it off.
that's when I went downstairs and I saw you...
...do what I did.
is that it? - Yeah.
I just need something of Boyd's to plant in the truck from the accident.
his wallet.
how did you know that was there?
I put it there.
I was giving Cole's truck another quick once-over and I found something that our blind-as-fucking-bats lab geeks missed.
what have you got?
a wallet.
he probably had it sitting on the console and then it went flying when he got hit.
I found it under the seat. - Cole's wallet?
no, that's just it. It's not Cole's.
whose is it?
Boyd Fowler's.
who the fuck is Boyd Fowler?
I'm going upstairs.
check it out.
there are locks of hair in here numbered 1 through 12.
12?
Jesus.
well, I'll run DNA on all the hair samples and match it to the victims.
the guy that did this...
died exactly where you're standing.
Hey.
in here.
the same exact barrel the girls were in.
Jesus. What'd he do with these?
the preliminary medical examiner's report said all the girls were electrocuted.
we're gonna need forensics in the attic.
I think he kept the girls up there.
it looks like Boyd Fowler has become our primary focus.
do you know this man?
no.
well, he knows you.
he has all your books and CDs in his house.
I've sold over a million copies of my book.
almost as many CDs.
I'm just trying to figure out how he came to be driving your truck.
well, I'm sorry, but...
I know him. Boyd Fowler.
he was one of your stalkers.
and how come I'm just now hearing this?
no reason to tell you about every nut that passes through.
he never seemed like a serious threat.
he took a few seminars a while back and then started showing up at our office asking for Mr. Chase.
I had to escort him off the premises a few times.
he was clearly a bit off, but he never struck me as dangerous.
he'd been in and out of our offices enough times.
probably saw where I put the keys.
when's the last time you had contact with him?
haven't seen him for a while.
couple of months maybe.
any idea where he might be?
no.
we have a warrant for his arrest.
I suggest that you be especially cautious, Mr. Chase, because if he has a thing for you, you could be in danger.
noted.
now, if you have any contact with him, please get in touch with us immediately.
this guy is very bad news.
I will.
thank you for coming in. I appreciate it.
you finally did something right.
steering the cops toward Boyd.
very smart.
it wasn't me.
daddy's going to Boca Raton tonight.
cause that's where Cole Harmon lives.
he's a bad man.
and I'm gonna try to find out who the rest of his bad man friends are.
you want that?
Hi.
there's my angel.
let me just set my things down.
wonder how much longer I'm gonna be able to talk to you like this.
soon you're gonna start to understand me.
Harrison clearly loves his Saint Brigid.
he put it with his favorite toys.
I put that in the toy box. - Sorry?
it's just a statue of a lady who died a long time ago.
she doesn't protect anybody or anything.
I should get to work. Here. Go to Sonya.
it's just this can be a very dark world at times, and since dear Brigid has always been a comfort to me,
I thought Harrison might feel the same.
I hope for his sake, you'd reconsider.
sure.
Bye, buddy.
so, uh...
what are you wearing tonight?
to the big stakeout?
a diaper probably.
I'll have to sit in that van with Batista for hours.
will you please not wear that awful shirt with the patterns all over it? It really makes me dizzy.
no, I, uh, only wore that as a joke.
Hey, I got to go. I'll see you later tonight.
okay.
Hey.
well, look at you. Pretty as a picture.
I only got a few minutes, so, uh, what do you got for me?
I don't work for free, Quinn.
all right, well, I just gave you 500 bucks.
and I told you about the girl.
but if you want to find out who she is, where she's from, and what she's doing in that damn house,
I might have to employ some methods just a little bit unorthodox.
and for that, you're gonna have to pay.
I don't know. - I know you got the cash.
Yeah, it's not that.
it's the pussy.
now lookie here, stud, if you're backing off this thing 'cause you're porking that guy's sister,
I'd say you've got your priorities as a cop all wrong.
I'm a little embarrassed for you.
I'll give you another five.
that'll work.
you don't have to do anything with this, okay?
you can just talk normally.
what do I have to do?
we're gonna walk you through the club so that our team can get a visual on you, and then you're just gonna wait by the door.
the second you see the Fuentes brothers, you walk up to them and you engage in conversation outside of the club until we move in and take 'em.
what am I supposed to say?
tell 'em how hot they look.
you really don't have to worry about anything. We're gonna be right there.
I want to make sure we're all in contact.
this is sergeant Batista. Is everybody getting this?
loud and clear. - I can hear you.
looks like we're all in place.
okay.
you'll do great.
they're already here.
say again? - I said they're already here.
sitting at the VIP table.
okay, how'd that happen? I thought we had all the doors covered.
I don't know.
I heard there's a secret door from the club next door, but I've never seen it.
okay, this is a change of plans.
Yasmin, go sit with them.
we're gonna sit tight until they leave.
once they step outside the club, we take them.
let's make sure we find that secret door and deploy a team there as well. Everyone got that?
got it. - Got it.
we've been here for over an hour.
I know.
well, you said there's a seminar in Naples.
don't you think he's there?
probably.
so what are you waiting for?
that.
the neighbor to go to bed.
I'm going in.
no, you're staying here.
what? No.
Yes. It's too dangerous.
I have no idea what's inside.
I'm gonna have my hands full without watching over you.
fine.
well, you can... Be the lookout.
it's so great working with you.
if you see anything, call me.
we are starting to look a little obvious.
I am gonna go get us a club soda.
all right, yeah.
he's calling me over.
no, keep moving. Ignore him.
this is lieutenant Laguerta. Officer Manzon, go to him, make nice, and try to get him to step outside the club.
lieutenant, no. This is a problem. These guys are dangerous.
stand down, Morgan.
she's in charge. Nothing we can do.
police! Drop that fucking gun!
holy fucking shit!
move! Move! Move!
stop right there. Down on the ground. Police! Drop the gun!
back away! - Drop the gun now!
Oh, you again.
you should walk away before this one gets more than just a little cut.
drop the gun right now.
please!
you okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
it's okay. Come here.
Cole as a teenager.
who the fuck are you?
no fucking way!
who are you, motherfucker?
we have to go before he sees our faces.
holy shit! I can't believe that just happened!
what made you come inside?
I thought I saw a shadow.
and that made you come crashing through a window?
I know. I know. I just had a feeling.
it was some sort of lizard brain thing.
she's starting to sound like me.
that's Cole.
and Boyd.
and Dan the dentist.
it's them from, like, 15 years ago.
do you recognize any of the others?
no, just those three.
what does this mean?
I don't know.
they've known each other since they were kids.
Oh, my God, Dexter. This is huge.
we just have to figure out who they are.
so what do we do next?
what?
you said "we."
put on your seatbelt.
this is a fucking disaster.
Carlos Fuentes was shot and killed.
our informant, Yasmin Aragon, was shot and killed, - as well as another innocent bystander. - Son of a bitch.
at this point, we don't know if it's by our gunfire or that of the two brothers.
additionally, three other bystanders were wounded.
I want a full report by 8: 00 A. M.
I know it looks bad. And it is bad...
but we are going to get through this. I promise you.
in the heat of battle...
all cops make occasional mistakes in judgment.
excuse me?
if mistakes were made, they most certainly were not mine.
Hey.
he was so relaxed and happy, I couldn't bear to move.
and I have to admit, he feels quite good.
he's always so happy in her arms.
partners come to us in various ways.
bound together for many different reasons.
but for any partnership to work, you must not only accept this person into your life, but accept her for who she is.
saint Brigid...
circle us with your light...
so that no darkness shall overcome our world.
Hey.
Hi.
Harrison, this is Lumen.
Hi. Oh, my goodness. Hello.
sometimes partners find us, and as much as we try??? into our lives regardless, until we finally realize how much we need them.
my name is Lee Siusheung
when I was a child, I loved watching cartoons
every time when Ultraman appeared, I would be super excited
it was he who told me there was justice in this world
justice badge?
don't move, mind the pin
OK, there
however, after I was 8
I have never watched cartoons again
I don't believe in anything now
I only believe in my own fists
take out all your money quickly, you stupid
what a waste of time
you call it a 9-section iron chain just by joining some iron pellets?
why don't you chop off your fingers to make a 1 0-section iron chain?
come on,
I am not afraid of pain
you really believe you are the Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain
what?
I said Siu Sheung is the Captain, dude
to hell with Siu Sheung
today I delivered goods to Block 8
and bumped into 5 bastards from So Uk Estate 1 0 feet trod on my head
is your head that big?
not only that they even pinched my finger with a knife
but I knew I had to keep calm at that moment
I said to myself
thunder!
you are bullying me like this
you will have to pay for it!
and then I was so smart
I pretended to be scared, I yelled
kid, no need to be afraid
in fact that...
...was a signal
upon receiving my order, Siu Sheung rushed to the scene
the Captain of Earth Guard eventually turned out
I and Siu Sheung exchanged knowing glances
he told me
earth Guard cannot do without me at that moment, I was somewhat touched
then I retreated in order to advance, so as to coordinate with Siu Sheung
at last, the 2 of us defeated the 5 master-hands
Siu Sheung, you are marvellous!
sorry, sorry
I am destined to be in the company of righteous friends so I don't mind saying this once more
if you don't join Siu Sheung's and my Earth Guard,
I don't care
but the loss is ultimately yours
take your shower and shut up
sir, I hope your hands won't shake
they started the fight first
it doesn't matter that I go to the police station with you
put down your gun first
get on the van
how many times have you done this?
the damn cops started it first
of course I had to fight back
I won't bail you out again next time
Hey, don't be like that
I will treat you to chicken in glutinous rice
to hell with your chicken in glutinous rice
chasing the bad guys and the devils
we all dream big
I want the world to be peaceful and all evils be overcome
the army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
the army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
hurry up, the big combination!
Hey, didn't you say you would buy parts to fix the fan?
mommy, come on out quick! The big combination!
the big combination!
coming, coming!
I have to go fry the vegetables
dinner will be served soon
let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go!
God Sigma is waiting for you
I am coming!
daddy!
daddy
do you reckon Ultraman can defeat the 3-head monster?
it is indeed risky
it all depends on whether his hand can be combined
if so, that would be OK
if not, he may lose
then won't the earth be in great danger?
even our estate will be in trouble
you don't have to worry
our estate has always been guarded by Ultraman
Really? Who?
me
you are not even as good as Mommy
even Ultraman would occasionally lose to monsters
that's too bad
Siu Sheung, it's time to go home for dinner
it's time, let's go
daddy, that's the Ultraman sword I want
it's Mommy's birthday
daddy has to buy birthday present for Mommy
Ultraman sword...next month next month we will buy Ultraman sword
justice badge?
you have been yearning for it, right?
give it to me
be careful, mind the pin
good, let's put it here
stand against Ultraman
daddy!
daddy...
daddy...
brother Lone, trust me, Brother Lone
though I am not as good at fighting as Siu Sheung or the Masked Rider
I can still 400% protect you, Brother Lone
brother Lone, why are you laughing? Brother Lone
you are so educated, yet all you know is laughing?
brother Lone, how come you never trust me?
Wow! Siu Sheung, why are you sitting so high up there?
Siu Sheung, don't you know that...
...you return at the right time
come back to Earth Guard it's a bit exhausting that I am the only guard
too little good guy, too many bad guy
I have a dream!
after deep deliberation
I have painstakingly written this proposal for Earth Guard
I have reserved a place for you
take a look
save vulnerable groups, combat estate bullies and rascals
Hey, don't turn the page
Hey, take a look
the 1 0 Aims and 5 Principles of Earth Guard
I have also drawn all the patrol routes and have even designed the uniform
but don't you think...
it's a bit too sexy?
how much is the patrol charge?
and protection fee? How much?
what if we got injured?
killed in action?
who will take care of our family?
I have no family
but you are right
with family, you have to be more considerate
so this is crap
don't deny yourself so completely
you just let me deny myself completely for once
a man-to-man fight 2 iced milk teas
we are closed
I am in a big rush
what? For here or to go?
you two are just practising
how much are the broken glasses? I will compensate
money doesn't always talk $1 0, 000 each $50, 000
50000
you have exceptional skill, don't waste it
our group always welcomes talents
come if you are interested.
matsumoto Group Yim Tai Muk
mom
you're home? Yes
the boss says these super spicy noodles are left over and they cannot be kept overnight
no discount for mild spicy noodle, but super spicy ones are $3 cheaper
only $3
are you really that short of cash?
do you want to poison your mom with spice?
no
you have been worrying about the route change fee
saving $3 dollars means $3 saved
the route change fee is $30, 000
do you really think it's $3?
don't even think about it if you don't have $30, 000
here is $50, 000.
spend the remainder on gas
did you rob?
I have told you I can make money by fighting
are you engaged in underground boxing?
I am now the head of security
have I not been a security guard?
if it pays so well I don't have to drive a minibus
matsumoto Group
I have to wear a suit for work
Hey, where is daddy's suit?
I have to wear it tomorrow
is this your daddy's suit?
Yes, it's my daddy's
not many people can wear this nowadays
take it off
I don't want it torn during fighting
there is a glass of water, don't let anyone touch it
it's a good fight
but you couldn't protect the glass of water
then are you hiring me or not?
can you report for duty at 9am tomorrow?
sure!
miss, if those in your bag are counted, the total is $48. 5
Oh, you are so smart at calculating?
did you spy on me?
take them out or I will regard it as shoplifting
please include this pack of sanitary napkin
the total is $80. 5, including this
I will handle it, you go first
sir, short by 50 cents
sir
I don't need that pack, refund me
Mr. Hon
I have ordered congee with pork and preserved small fish
good
do you want to add a dish of vegetable?
yes
new colleague?
good morning！Come eat
fresh plain congee
plain congee again?
I can't survive without meat
let me introduce our new colleague
Wah Chiu, Tak Bun
call me Siu Ho
there's still one that hasn't arrived yet. I will introduce him to you later
brother Chiu, Brother Tak Bun, Brother Siu Ho
you don't have to call me brother, just Siu Ho is fine
plain congee again!
freshly cooked!
how do you want us to call you?
my name is Lee Siusheung
brother Siusheung, would you like tea or water?
just call me Siusheung please
I asked you if you would like tea or water
tea
pour it yourself OK
uncle Lui Good morning
brother Tong， Brother Wing, good morning
take a seat
when the congee arrives, people arrive
let me drink a cup of tea first, I am so thirsty
good, congee. Pork liver congee
I abstain from eating meat today, no congee for me
give it to Lui
help yourself, I love congee
such big bowls. Don't stop, don't stop
you will get sick if you don't eat anything
of course
you will be senior superintendent if you get another promotion
do you know why you get promoted so fast?
don't ask the PCs to work next time
they will only make a mess of it, you will be implicated sooner or later
hello
right, this is our new colleague
Siusheung, Ah Nam
Hello? Hello?
as a formality, I need to tell you
Mr. Hon comes here for morning dim sum everyday
wherever he goes, we go
never do anything that would disgrace him
then do we have to fight?
we are security guards, we ensure the safety of our boss
we do not fight
then why do you have a knife on you?
smoking time
what are you staring at? You junior security guard!
never fight with your colleagues again
if not, nobody will help you when you get into trouble
I don't hire you because you are a good fighter
don't think that you excel at fighting
if you do a good job, you can stay.
if not, I will fire you
there's no difference between hiring you or another
don't think that you are outstanding
put on your jacket, come out
how much were the stuffs that day?
your shoplifting skill was poor
is that old dude your boss?
none of your business
I have been with him since I was very young
go
behind
go
is the lady with you?
don't wander around, wait for my call
OK
good morning, miss
good morning
you are up
good morning
what are you all doing?
you don't have to feel sorry
smile, everyone!
smile!
daddy
daddy, why do you look so dumb?
have a bowl of pork congee
I want plain congee with an egg
yes
my daughter
daddy,
I am a big girl now
is that so?
you are so fond of playing in the band why don't you return to Taiwan and I'll get Wu Bai to produce an album for you
I want Jay Chou to produce it for me
daddy, actually I don't really need to play in a band
moreover, I don't want to return to Taiwan
it's so boring
Mr. Hon Yu those idiots didn't target me they targeted you
you have to find out who did it, chop chop
it is I who should worry about you, instead of you worrying about me
having studied abroad really makes a difference
I will ask Shing to get someone to protect you
don't!
with a bunch of followers like that, it is in fact most dangerous
I feel perfectly safe walking around all by myself
nobody knows I am your daughter
how about Tai Muk?
he's both uncouth and weird
eating congee with fried egg? You weirdo
let's do it this way
you deploy this new guy to protect me
he's younger, so it's less gross
he looks dumb
is he OK?
your bodyguards were genuinely dumb
he was the only one who could catch up with me
Oh, he could catch up with you
what's wrong? What's wrong?
nothing
as a man, you are really pathetic
don't drive so fast next time
I don't know how to drive slow
Siu Sheung!
Siu Sheung!
Siu Sheung...
my beloved brother!
let's practise a little first
I have been missing you ever since you reported for duty
new teammate?
a man-to-man fight
your friend?
Annie, this is Big Bird
a man-to-man fight
OK, no need for words
as long as you are a new teammate recommended by Siu Sheung you are definitely eminent
have a drumstick first
wow, awesome! Drumstick!
what a glutton
but it doesn't matter. As our teammate
I won't allow you to starve
a man-to-man fight
OK
I will come back after delivering the drumstick...
...to have a man-to-man fight with you
here is your drumstick Awesome!
Hey, what is this "new teammate" you talked about?
earth Guard
I am 002, Siusheung is 001
earth Guard?
you mean those in uniform who carry out special missions?
right! Right!
we even have our uniform designed
wow, stylish!
but we haven't designed a uniform for female teammate yet
Hey, it doesn't matter, I can wear male uniform
Hey, how much is the enrolment fee?
I only got $1 0, 000
$1 0, 000?
no need for that much
we only charge $29
we don't have change for such a big bill
Hey, you aren't serious, are you?
I am serious. We will protect the earth
Hey, what is my number?
since you are recommended by Siu Sheung,
I will reserve 007 for you
good! What is your unique skill?
unique skill?
sure I have one
laser gun?
female teammates pay more attention to details
it turns out that we lack a logo
stop talking for the moment. Stand still if you want to look good
Yes, 007
done
let me see
wow, damn stylish!
Siu Sheung, come join us
crazy!
you come here
Hey, my eyes hurt!
my turn, my turn
Hey, you move over a bit. You move over a bit
move over a bit. Move over a bit
lower your arm，a bit Lower
Hey, your legs Your legs
stretch your legs a bit
like me Like him, like Siusheung
hurry up. Come on
I am 007
who are you?
and who are you?
what!? I am the owner of this flat
auntie, auntie, how do you do?
my name is Annie, the boss of your son
boss?
so young and you are a boss?
it's OK
where is Siu Sheung?
taking a bath
mom, finished work?
Hey, it's your turn
sit down
you two have reached such a stage so quickly?
with those spots on her face, she's kind of ugly
she's the daughter of my boss
I know
if she were not the daughter of your boss
I would strongly object to your relationship
imagine, when you have a baby in the future what will his face look like?
who will be look like?
he will look like me
wow, dinner!
awesome!
wow, it's worth drinking to now
what?
Hey, dig in, dig in
dig in Good, come on
spicy hot pot! Can you eat this?
awesome! I am Taiwanese
what a coincidence! I am also Taiwanese
Really? Really!
what a coincidence
Hey, let's drink a beer to this happy coincidence
good idea. Siu Sheung, get us a beer
beer!
where did you get it?
Cheers! Cheers!
auntie, you are pretty
Really?
many people say so
how do you keep up such a youthful appearance?
what brand of cream do you use?
I've heard about this wonderful mask. Have you tried it out?
it whitens and reduces wrinkles
so dramatic?
he dashed onto the stage and tried to draw his pistol so I bashed him with my guitar
gunmen are reckless they would shoot indiscriminately
I was so smart
I bumped him off, and I jumped out trying to attract attention so more people would come rescue me
great, what a heroine
then what happened?
then...
the first person who rushed to rescue me was...
your son
Siusheung?
right, he loved saving people when he was a kid
his favourite cartoon was...
what Stigma?
what 3 loyal warriors?
Oh, God Sigma!
Yes, God Sigma!
it was my favourite cartoon when I was a kid she also liked watching God Sigma
the theme song was sung by Leslie Cheung
Leslie Cheung didn't sing it well
my Siu Sheung does a better job singing it
Really?
when he was a kid, his singing was famous in our neighbourhood
his late father loved listening to him sing
Really?
I have a karaoke version of the song
great! Take it out
wow, you are really something
I am not that good
God Sigma rules the universe
the 3 loyal warriors
with courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
flying in the starry sky he discharges mysterious missions
looking at the home star afar which is so bright and beautiful
chasing the bad guys and the devils
Hey, I rarely see you so late
where are your wife and daughter?
traveling in Thailand
what happened outside?
it's too bad that I am so busy, otherwise I would have gone with them
that chap didn't die, what do you think?
which chap?
I saw Wah Chiu trying to do it.
you didn't see him?
the boss will take care of it
hon Yu's success...
is attributable to our efforts 10 years already!
now he has a business empire
money laundered, he is the chairman of a listed company
what are we doing now?
head of security?
if we didn't block off bullets for him, he would have died 9 times
who else is in it?
you should ask me why I revolt against him
search your heart
haven't you thought of taking over his position?
I haven't
I were not you,
I have
if need be, I kill. We are brothers, so what?
where is Wah Chiu? Call him now
Shing, you have followed me for years this is the first time you don't answer my call
there is an internal fraud in the Security Department
I need two days to take care of it
security Department?
does that include you?
Shing was not involved
did you hear it?
your men said you were not involved
despite being so experienced, you don't know about your men's revolt
tell me if I should still trust you
brother Hon
if we were to revolt, you would have fallen long time again
that means you want to revolt
you can't even protect your wife and daughter
you'd better shut up
we built the "society" together
I don't understand why we are still your lackeys
because you are incapable
this world no longer needs "societies
I cleared your names for you
I made Matsumoto a listed company
I want to let you know what is meant by morality and justice
revolt? You all!
if we were to revolt, you won't be standing here
no matter what...
Shing, learn how to be a man in your next life!
Siusheung
don't you think it's dangerous for Ultraman to fight with the monsters?
should be
if his hand cannot be combined, it will be dangerous
what should we do then?
no need to fear there are other Ultramen in the world
Really? Where?
me!
Hey, you are speeding again, I will throw up
the boat has arrived, are we leaving?
no matter what, we will die
either we die separately or we die together
I don't know what you want. Leave when there is a chance
hon Yu will not let us off
you fought so hard for a way out then you refused to leave
now you are back, you have no more choice
you can only kill me, take over my position then wait to be killed
this is your fate
daddy!
run!
daddy!
do not ask me why
because you have never treated me as a brother
how are they?
your son only suffers minor injuries
the man sent in with your son is in more serious condition
I've got it
sorry
don't say sorry every time you see me
it's not your fault
I am really sorry
don't claim responsibility for everything
if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen
I did harm to you and your son
don't say that
you have never let go for so many years
I am all right
my husband and my son are the same
they would sacrifice their lives for justice
whatever.
I'd like to thank your son for saving Siusheung
please ask him not to protect Siusheung anymore
he spends his whole life protecting another person
that is not necessary
my son is no longer the old Lee Siu Sheung
it is he who decided to do that
he knew what happened to you and your son so he decided to protect Siusheung
because he thinks that is...
...the most basic duty of a policeman
mom...
mom...
you have woken up
go home if you are sleepy
are you hungry?
I...
I will never do it again
it's OK
sorry
don't cry
Really?
it's really OK
silly boy, don't cry
mom
have you seen Annie?
don't worry, she is safe
I brought the papers for you to sign. It's your father's last will
I want to sell them all
but, madam, that's gonna take a minimum of 2 weeks
no, I need it right now
what is Matsumoto Group?
who does Hon Yu think he is?
you have to help him
you scum.
you scum.
don't go!
it's none of your business
you think too highly of yourself.
this is your Achilles' heel
don't think of revenge
Shing is not someone you can handle
your father was a coward
I am not
if you don't forgive him, I can't do anything
but I have saved you, that makes you my friend
I don't need a friend like you
get lost!
do you want to lose your life?
you have already lost one hand. You can never defeat him
losing one hand is my own business
my life is mine, it's none of your business
your life is not yours alone
you can't even defeat me
if you just go out like that, how is it different from suicide?
when I was a kid, I thought you were superb
you had courage, passion...
and a sense of justice
you said you would beat the bad guys up
look at you, what a trash!
even my Daddy was cheated by you
don't you know you have fooled many people?
rubbish!
it's fine that you are like this
you will be sent to the landfill
you are better off than me
I am sitting here everyday doing nothing
you cannot be a hero anyway
let me give you a hand, so that you won't implicate other people
if you were Lee Siusheung will you forgive your father?
if I were Lee Siusheung
I will definitely not forgive a man...
...who turns a blind eye to my father's death
daddy
I have always respected you
I know you are a righteous man
since I was a child,
I have been able to tell people proudly...
...that my father is But Ching Mo
he is a good cop
I have learned something from Siu Sheung
if you think it is right persist in it till the end
what do you want?
I come to find out what you want
I really want to...
...help the world...
...create a new order
who do you think you are?
I have chips,
I can do whatever I want
you have no chips
you are not qualified to talk to me
uncle Choi
will you come to help Siu Sheung retaliate?
retaliate against whom so late at night?
to beat up the bad guys of South Group
are you nuts?
how dare you beat up the South Group guys?
I am not that stupid
Shing, come out!
you come out, Shing!
so you are Shing.
you look so gross
I am the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
you come out and let's have a man-to-man fight
are you afraid? A man-to-man fight!
what captain are you?
my name is Big Bird, the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain
I come here today to seek justice for Siu Sheung!
is the cripple not dead yet?
what are you talking about?
he is completely fine, just has a little flu
cut the crap.
let's have a man-to-man fight!
let him in
I am not afraid of you
although I personally can fight 10 people since you and I are on the same level
I now give you a chance to fight me one-on-one
that's really something
so I am forced to use my unique skill
the invincible...
triple rod!
come again!
Shing, finish fighting before you leave!
boss, do you have spicy hot noodle?
you two finish retaliation so fast?
come again!
come again! You have not won...
...as long as I am not dead
Shing, stop!
stop! Don't!
don't, Brother Shing!
don't! Let my friend off
No!
No!
big Bird!
no, Brother Shing!
I beg you
brother Shing, please don't!
I kowtow to you
sorry So you want to retaliate against me?
I won't retaliate, I won't retaliate
big Bird! Big Bird!
brother Shing, sorry
take the trash away
big Bird, let's go
you have to lick the ground clean first
if you want to be a hero, you should not have friends
big Bird, it's OK now
big Bird, we have arrived
big Bird...
Siu Sheung, I have brought you a big drumstick
look, I asked Uncle Choi to add more condiments
it's delicious
Hey, no need to worry
you just nurse your injuries here
I and my buddies will take care of your mom and Annie
your injuries are just minor
enough!
don't you know you are disgusting
get lost!
don't ever bother me again!
go!
no matter what,
earth Guard can't do without you
you will forever be the Captain in my heart
Hello, Professor? This is Annie
I need your help, as soon as possible ...you return at the right time
come back to Earth Guard it's a bit exhausting that I am the only guard
too little good guy too many bad guy
do you really believe there are Ultramen in this world?
Hey, don't belittle yourself
Ultramen are everywhere
big Bird's birthday party 7pm tonight, Rhododendron Restaurant
dear neighbours, Big Bird had a wish before his death which was forming Earth Guard
his plan was...
...to assemble the brothers from Blocks 9 and 1 0
plus our home delivery team, waiters and bartenders
then we can form an unified Earth Guard to ensure that justice is done
if you insist on justice justice will kill all the people around you
as a cop, I am prepared for death
Really?
the protective uniforms designed by Big Bird have arrived
we also have 5 delivery cars which were all fixed by Big Bird 4 of us can share 1 car
big Bird has done so much. His only hope...
...was more people could join our Earth Guard
someone will come for you
I want you to watch your rescuer die
how he dies for justice
do you believe there are Ultramen in this world?
big Bird said Ultramen are everywhere
I used to think he was so dumb
but now...
I believe
that Ultramen is everywhere in this world
let's go
where to?
I will go beat up the scoundrels
big Bird was killed by them
we used to beat him up too
that's right. We may die if we go
have you thought carefully?
have you thought about this
in our whole lives, have we ever been stylishly brave for once?
big Bird has always treated me as the Captain but I have never shouldered the responsibility of a captain
you have always loved fighting but not once was worthwhile
however, some people really have to be beaten up
do you remember the day my father died?
there is a price to pay...
if justice is to be done
he was willing to dash out like that for a stranger
today, I finally understand why he did that
because it is our responsibility
we are very old anyway
besides
besides, we have learned martial arts
if we just do home delivery, it would be a huge waste
shall we reserve a place for the boss?
are you ready to go?
tonight, Earth Guard eventually discharges its duty
I will bring Big Bird along...
...to rescue a person whom we believe is worth the effort
let's set off, friends!
what is the total cost of the uniforms?
get me 11 suits
run, son!
mom, I didn't fight because of this medal
I know, you want to punish the bad guys
Yes! Next time when I punish the bad guys
I will notify you
you can count me out
by the way,
I prefer...
daddy's badge
justice Set D 2 more bowls of beat-up-the-bad-guy noodle
big bad guy or small bad guy?
big, of course
here come the fresh pineapple buns!
sir, it's wrong to jump the queue
you will get your bun
but if you don't follow the rules we will use the Mantis Boxing on you
it was a good fight
but you couldn't protect the glass of water
God Sigma rules the universe
the 3 loyal warriors
with courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
flying in the starry sky
neighbours, here come the egg tarts!
great! Eat while it's hot
dear neighbours, how do you do?
help! Ghost!
this young man with such a hot temper must be Brother Siu Sheung
dear neighbours, you don't have to scream
in fact I am Big Bird's little brother
little Bird
Oh, Little Bird
I come to inherit my brother's post...
...as the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
look!
I have already put on the uniform
teammates, granny's pocket money has been stolen!
let's go!
it's late. - Yeah.
that's not supposed to be one of Monet's lost frames?
no, just trying to clear my head.
good. About that.
Vincent Adler -- Seven years ago, he ran a huge ponzi scheme and disappeared with a billion dollars.
you knew him?
he's the man who made me who I am today.
he's rained hell down on both our lives.
you knew. You knew, and you didn't say anything?
I just figured it out myself, okay?
I'm trying to reconcile the Adler I knew - with the man responsible for -- For Kate?
for Mozzie? - Yeah. So let's get him.
come on.
start talking.
Yeah, I'm not much of a beer drinker, so
I know. That's why I brought you this.
I don't recognize the bottle.
that's because it cost as much as the beer.
I don't even need a corkscrew.
Nope. Okay.
now... How do you know Adler? - It's a long story.
if we are gonna catch this guy, just like I caught you, - I need to know everything. - There's too much to tell.
you're gonna plead the fifth?
a few secrets are good, Peter -- Keeps the mystery alive.
I get it.
this story includes some stuff about crimes I don't know about.
Yeah. -No. You're not holding back on me.
we've got all night. I'll make you a deal.
full immunity for anything you say from this moment until the sun rises over that balcony.
full immunity?
did you kill anybody? - No.
then full immunity.
all right. Let's start with this.
Mozzie decoded the music box. It's an equation.
this is what it built.
it's a fractal. - Very good.
I've seen one like it before. - Where?
in vincent Adler's office when I worked for him.
how did you meet him?
if you want to know about Adler, we got to start with Mozzie.
why am I not surprised?
it was eight years ago. I was new to the city, didn't know the east village from the west.
all right, follow the lady.
all you got to do is follow the lady.
I mix them fast, but if your eyes are faster, you win -- Simple as that.
lady's in the middle.
you got good peepers, pal.
want to double up, buddy? - Sure.
toss them. - Okay.
you think you can follow them, but I'm saying that you can't. It's all a game of you vs. Me.
all right, here we go, here we go.
where is she? Where is she?
watch her. Watch her.
she's a sneaky lady, but I think she likes you.
she's on the right. - No, she's back in the middle.
are you crazy? She's definitely on the right.
it's his money, kid.
crap. she's sneaking around on you, boss.
lucky guess.
you're so good at this, why don't you put your own money down?
you gonna bet or walk away.
you!
what you got?
all right.
$50? Come on, really take this guy.
time to put up or shut up, kid.
it's up to you.
all right. Let's go $500.
now we're talking.
all right, looks like I hooked me a whale here.
looky, looky, looky, hey, diddle, diddle, the queen's in the middle. Follow her fast. Follow her slow.
my hands are fast. Your eyes are slow.
see her? See her?
pick that little lady and you win, my man.
all you got to do is show me the smile on the lady's face, and you walk away with it all.
you sure? - Yeah. He's sure.
I'm sure.
fun game, man. Thank you.
you toss the broads really well.
damn it!
Cado, you want to earn 10 bucks? - $20.
Seriously? - You gonna stiff me this time?
go, you little weasel. Follow that guy.
he's in my traing program.
I'm the guy from the park.
Hey, I'm not here to give you hospital time, kid.
good,'cause I'm not giving you your money back.
keep it.
what's your angle?
look, I been running find-the-lady for years, and even I didn't catch that swap.
Where's your partner? - I left him.
Why? - I need an upgrade.
Mozzie had a goatee?
well, only to distract from his toupee.
we talked. Moz told me about his detroit days.
he'd been running street cons since he was a kid.
notice my lack of surprise.
what does any of this have to do with Adler?
well, he's the reason Mozzie found me.
these forgeries are exquisite.
who says it's a forgery?
given your living conditions, I do.
how did you match the tricolor seal?
just eyeballed it. - By eye?
you are very talented, kid.
with you as my partner, we could move way beyond the street hustle.
what did you have in mind?
a long con, which, if executed properly, would enable us to purchase and retire on neighboring temperate-zone islands in a mere six months.
I just got to this city, and I'm too young to retire.
I'm talking about summiting the everest of swindles.
who's the mark?
Vincent Adler? - Yeah.
now this is getting good.
that was the first time I heard Adler's name.
what?
those bonds -- that's the first time I'd come across you.
Really? Tell me.
you're stalling. - No, I'm not. Come on.
we got -- we got a long time until sunrise.
we got plenty of beer and...this.
so tell me.
did you have to fight to take my case?
Yeah. It was a real tug-of-war.
here's another one for you, Peter.
stop hoarding all the new cases, Burke.
bond forgery sent over from nypd.
two phony atlantic incorporated bonds in six months.
what? You want it?
two in half a year?
atlantics have never been forged.
I'll pass. - All right.
this is quality work.
so is my kid's drawing on the fridge.
he's all yours. - Okay.
I think this guy has a future.
what was my Nickname?
what? -Come on. Every case gets a Nickname.
Hagen was the dutchman before you i. d.'d him.
what was my nickname?
don't recall. - That's too bad.
well, the sooner you rember, the sooner we can move on.
James bonds. - Bonds.
James bonds. - James bonds.
Yes, yes. Would you like another beer? - Yeah.
shaken, not stirred?
see, I knew it was a mistake telling you.
believe me, yours was just one file in a giant stack of cases.
but it was on top.
you weren't that good.
this guy's good.
honey, come on -- Are we gonna put this away, - or is that our new coffee table? - Oh, I'm sorry.
what about this one is getting under your skin?
you really want to hear about this?
well, of course, always. - All right.
he's tampering with federal evidence.
that's a forgery?
the seal, the signature, the security strip.
see, most forgers are only experts at one aspect.
the man who forged this bond is capable of bigger things.
he can do it all. - Well, so can you.
lose the 'stache? - Yeah, sorry, magnum.
I still love you. - I love you, too.
Satchmo -- Elizabeth named him?
how do you know I didn't?
well, elizabeth likes old jazz. You don't.
don't forget I knew a fair amount about you before it was over.
know thine enemy.
know thyself, and you will win a hundred battles.
Mozzie's influence? - Big student of history.
tell me how you went after Adler.
he was a big fish.
there he is, our white whale.
what did you find out about him?
well, he's the c. e.o. of Adler financial management, - and he runs their top hedge fund. - Good.
What'd he bring in?
I don't know. - Never say that. Know everything.
Adler made $150 million last year, up 8% from the prior year.
know thine enemy, and you will win -- sun tzu.
all right. What's the con?
well, Adler routes a hefty percentage of his profits into an account in the caymans every six months.
Tax-free? - Exactly.
all we need to reroute his next wire transfer is two pieces of information
account number and password.
that's where you come in.
where does he keep it -- Personal safe, deposit box?
in his head. He's too smart to keep it anywhere else.
I can't just walk up and ask him for it. That's impossible.
a wise man once said it's fun to do the impossible.
bertrand russell? - Walt disney.
you should read more.
our clock is five months.
you'll ingratiate yourself, become a trusted friend, then convince him to tell you.
why don't you do it?
I'm more the behind-the-scenes guy.
all right, look at me, and then look in the mirror.
who has a better chance of charming Adler at the charity dinner on friday?
the antiquities recovery project?
it's five grand a plate. I can't afford that.
well, you can if you cash in a few more of your bonds.
big mistake.
cashing those bonds was a calculated risk.
but it was worth it for the con we were about to run on Adler.
Yeah, but bankrolling them got us our first visual on you.
if I recall, I wasn't the only one who made a mistake that day.
no, hang on, hang on.
Yeah, it was that bank in midtown.
did you get it? - Yep.
the teller was a sweetheart.
Oh, she gave you a sucker.
you know, the irony of that would not be lost on alanis morissette.
this guy's a forger. He's good.
what? Brooks brothers suit.
Yes, I understand. - So?
so that means fed -- Talking to the bank manager.
we got to go.
...these bonds, I want you to call me immediately.
never met a fed before. - Let's keep it that way.
detain him if possible. - Absolutely.
good. - Excuse me.
sorry, I-I couldn't help but overhear. Are you with the fbi?
special agent Peter Burke.
I - I just took some money out of the bank, and you heard you talking about counterfeiting.
your money's safe. I'm looking after counterfeit bonds.
well, I have some bonds at home.
how would I know if they're not real?
I'm sure they're fine.
well, thanks again for all the hard work you're doing, agent Burke.
that's for you. Have a good day.
he's not a nanny goat in a petting zoo. He's a fed.
within minutes, he could have set up a five-block perimeter -- Hundreds of trench-coated g-men.
it was worth it. We now know two things.
we got to move off bonds, and his name is Peter Burke.
know thy enemy, right? - Fine.
now you've got the money to pay for the invitation.
what name you gonna use? - I don't know.
nicholas halden. - Quaint.
get yourself a few aliases. You're gonna need them.
Oh, pop quiz, hot shot -- Adler's market strategy pre-crash?
short derivatives, bullish on commodities.
you have learned much, grasshopper.
why are you filling that bottle with bargain red?
have you studied Adler's wine list?
is that the '91 bordeaux?
the one year it was corked in the wrong bottle.
$800 a pop.
I, of course, got this bottle empty.
best served when the guests are drunk.
and I asked my cleaner to keep an eye out for something in your size.
Yeah, I don't know if I'm a suit guy.
you'll be fine.
well, I really appreciate you coming. - Thanks.
Mr. Adler? Nick halden. Nice to meet you.
I brought this from my collection.
that's very generous. Thanks for coming.
Hey, nice play on the emerging markets last quarter.
you really called russia.
well, it all came down to grains, didn't it?
where do you think they're going?
bull market. For us, not europe.
I'd say their imports are up 20%.
interesting. Enjoy the party.
Raphael'ssaint george and the dragon
it's a powerful piece. - Commodities and art?
you've got diverse interests.
like you, art is my passion.
then you should talk to my assistant.
Nick halden.
Hi. I'm Kate moreau. - Hi.
you like it? - What? What? Yeah.
no, it's,-- It's breathtaking.
it's my favorite one.
Raphael was a master of balance
thick brush strokes for the landscape, but the skin tones are almost...translucent.
are you an artist? - I dabble.
I tried, but the romance of being a starving artist wore off very fast.
well, you won't find any original Nick haldens at a gallery downtown.
what do you do?
I'm looking for new opportunities.
excuse me, sir. May I take that?
thank you.
you're here to cozy up to my boss.
if I work for Adler, I can go anywhere.
any advice?
I've seen the seating chart, and you're nowhere near him.
that's your first challenge.
Hi.
I like a challenge.
good luck, Nick. - Thanks.
it seems my date has been relegated to the buenos aires table.
you have until the salad course arrives to tell me what you want. Go.
I want to work for you.
in what capacity, other than your enthusiasm for grains and paint?
acquisitions. My team is full.
cameron Singer -- You're about to buy his firm.
Speculation's been front page of thejournalall week.
pass the bread.
well, he's been avoiding that woman.
next week, Hannah fields will announce her new investment branch. She's buying out Singer.
he's gonna back out of your deal, and the media will eat it up.
your company will appear unstable.
that could spook investors.
I'm gonna continue my meal now with someone who looks better in an cocktail dress than you.
well, look into Singer.
if it turns out I'm right, call me.
the Singer deal -- Was it true? - Absolutely.
Mozzie and I had been spying on them for weeks.
Adler ditched Singer and brought me in a month later.
he hired you to find things for him to buy.
well, part of my job was knowing everything about everyone Adler dealt with.
he had a lot of holdings and a lot of enemies.
turns out I had a knack for rooting them out.
and Kate was there the whole time.
is that when you guys got together?
no, no. She had a boyfriend.
it's not there.
all right, we'll just have to try again.
remind me again why I let you make my favorite necklace disappear.
Because...you like magic.
someday you're going to tell me all of your secrets.
I mean it.
may I?
maybe someday.
come out with me on friday.
I,-- I have your assignment from Adler.
he wants you to look into this.
right.
looks like someone's been looking into his recent art acquisitions.
michael asked me to move to chicago with him.
Chicago?
are you gonna go? - I-I am, in a month.
it's a big step. - Yeah. I know.
well, you'll like chicago.
They,-- They have a great art museum, and decent pizza.
little windy. - Yeah, I've heard that.
I should just get this - I need to get back to work.
what is this?
it's a fractal -- A mathematical curiosity.
that was the first time you'd seen one? - Yeah.
you know, he was obsessed with them.
his were similar to that one, but none was an exact match.
okay, so, Kate was going to chicago with another guy, and you were trying to root out whoever was looking into Adler's stuff.
keep talking.
you found the culprit. - She talked her way in.
she seems mostly interested in your south american acquisitions.
and you got her to come here in person?
I had the foundation feed her a story that they were impressed with her research.
she thinks she's here for a job interview.
bring her in. - Yes, sir.
miss hunter.
it's a pleasure to meet you. - Have a seat.
miss hunter...
your passion for antiquities is unusual for such a young woman.
well, every object has a story to tell.
I find those stories fascinating.
that was almost convincing.
who are you working for?
I don't work for anyone...yet.
that's why I'm here. - You can drop the act.
someone is paying you to get into my records.
now, who is that? Why don't you tell me?
sir, maybe it would be best if we
what are you looking for?
there were rumors you made some big discoveries.
I got curious.
I thought you wanted to share your art with the world.
that's for me to decide.
you accessed my private database.
you made copies of my records.
I should bring charges.
everybody gets one big mistake in life and one opportunity to fix it.
I believe in second chances, Miss hunter.
I think you're clever enough to know what I mean.
Thanks, Nick.
grateful to be here, Mr. Adler.
Vincent.
your hard work deserves a reward.
thank you.
I know I don't meet the buy in, but
Nick, come on, now. We've talked about this.
you know I don't like my people to invest in the fund.
you've made exceptions.
for you.
thank you, sir.
you invested your money with him. - All of it.
we all did. He was making us 14%.
you didn't know it was a scam?
no. My goal at the time was to prove my loyalty to Adler.
the job became my life.
then what happened to Alex?
I know there's more to that story.
you're sweet.
nice trick.
you got me.
you got off easy.
too late to apologize. - I'm not gonna apologize.
it's my job to catch you.
it's your job to not get caught.
fair enough.
what do you want?
buy me a drink, and we'll talk.
let's go.
Nick Halden -- That's a good name.
not your real one, but I like it.
I recognize a fellow grifter when I see one, Nick.
all right.
humor me, Alex.
what were you really looking for?
something Adler doesn't have.
he has everything.
he doesn't have this.
it's a music box.
quite the holy grail.
it's worth about as much.
so Alex turned you on to the music box.
Yeah, she'd been chasing it for years.
she heard Adler had information on it.
did he? - He had a rumor that it was at the amalienborg palace in copenhagen.
said she'd send me a message if she ever need my help getting it.
what kind of message?
a flower.
did she ever send it?
Yeah, but that's another part of the story.
Alex disappeared, and Kate Well, things changed.
you're taking a sick day?
I'm not allowed to feel lousy?
every day with Adler counts.
I've already got the siphon in place. All we need is the password.
I'll get the password.
you know, I'm sensing your heart isn't totally into this.
my heart is fine.
this is about the girl.
I thought she left for chicago.
she left today.
you know, it's probably for the best.
now you can focus.
I got to go, okay?
you're supposed to be in chicago.
it's a big step... In the wrong direction.
Why?
because you're here.
so, you and Adler developed a connection, and you and Kate were finally together.
you had it all.
Yeah, I was eating the best food, wearing the best suits, drinking the best wine -- The kind that has corks.
it was the perfect life.
and it was also the perfect lie.
you and Mozzie were still working the long con.
trying to make the lie real.
but every con has an expiration date.
Adler makes the transfer on friday, and you still haven't gotten the password yet.
I said I'll get it, i'll get it.
Oh, good, because I thought you were having second thoughts about abandoning your new town-and-country lifestyle.
don't kid yourself.
Kate doesn't even know your real name.
none of them do.
they care about me, okay?
she cares about me.
um, no.
she cares about Nick halden, and he doesn't exist.
I hear the suit's been asking around about you.
he has a sketch.
Where'd he get a sketch?
Oh, they always have a sketch or a print or something.
look, it's time to finish this job and move on.
let's have a look at you.
never worn a custom suit before.
the fit is perfect... Except for the cuff.
the break should be an eighth of an inch above the shoe.
Nelson. - Good eye, sir.
I can't accept. This is a $10, 000 suit.
you can and you will.
some people say dress for the job you want.
I say dress as the man you want to be.
Nick, men like you and I --We have an obligation to assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear to the art we collect to the women in our lives.
you and Kate have gotten close.
Yeah.
you look good together.
how does she feel about it?
there are things about me that I haven't told her.
I wouldn't worry.
oftentimes, the things we try and hide are the most obvious to the people around us.
everything all right?
Nelson, would you excuse us for a moment?
of course. - Thanks.
there's something you should know.
what's wrong?
I flagged a small irregularity in your account in the caymans.
Trace-analysis reports were inconclusive.
what kind of irregularity?
blips from a random i. p.Address.
hacker?
it's probably someone from the bank, confirming.
but I'd have to look into the account details to be sure.
you'd need the password.
I'll arrange a time for us to go to the bank so you can access it yourself.
no, no.
I trust you.
bank closes at 6: 00. Burn this when you're done.
don't sell yourself short.
Kate'll love you for who you really are... As will others.
you like the hat?
I could get used to it.
are you all dressed up with somewhere else to go?
no, I just have to be somewhere by 6: 00.
it's a commitment I made a long time ago.
I think that you should blow off said commitment.
yeah? - Look.
our violinist agrees.
you are staying here with me.
I promised a friend.
I can't I can't back out of it.
Kate, I'm... - What's wrong, Nick?
I just feel like You and me and all this I don't know.
I feel like I could blink, and it'd all be gone.
you just blinked.
I'm still here.
then nothing else matters.
you didn't get the password.
you said it yourself. This is a long con.
you stepped on the brakes when you should have leaned in.
it's Kate, isn't it?
I'm in love with her.
every con man gets his heart broken once.
she's not gonna break my heart.
Well...We'll get them next time.
love is a temporary madness.
it erupts like an earthquake and then subsides.
St. Augustine.
good.
you've been reading.
a smart guy told me to.
Oh, my god.
I want more.
what? You're insatiable.
pizza. - What?
we have half a margherita left over from last night.
wait, hold on. Whoa Who said you get the sheet? No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, I get it. - All right.
mine.
Nick. - What?
the neighbors can see you.
Oh. Hi, neighbors. Should I give them a little show?
no. Here. Look. There. - Ooh, I got a hat, too.
now you're presentable. - All right.
you like that?
put some pants on.
floors of wall street.
you got the sheet. You don't get the last slice.
it's only fair.
Vincent Adler has disappeared, and with him hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients' money.
a preliminary investigation indicates his investment firm may have been built on a giant house of cards.
securities regulators now claim Adler never traded any shares for client accounts.
if true, Adler's disappearance could prove to be the brilliant exit strategy - for one of the greatest financial frauds of our time. - Holy cow.
can you believe it?
who'd have figured?
nobody saw this coming?
this guy took thousands of people for their life savings, including charities.
clinton jones.
word around here is that you're putting together a special white-collar task force.
I am.
well, I've only been here a few months.
but I was wondering, if there were some spots open, if I could get a shot.
are you the one who put the dutchman on our radar?
Yes, sir.
I studied a profile like his at quantico.
well, I can't promise anything.
it is a long list, agents with more seniority -- You know how it is.
that's not the same sucker you got from james bonds last year, is it?
people talk.
Yeah. Well, nobody gets why i'm still holding on to this.
unfinished business.
I get it.
so, Adler disappeared, but what about his account?
there was only a dollar left in it.
the password was an anagram for "nice try neal."
then what happened with Kate?
no money, no jobs. It's all gone.
I know. I know. Hey, hey.
we're gonna be okay.
it's just you and me now, right?
that's all that matters.
come here.
we're gonna get it all back, okay?
okay.
how?
okay, if we're gonna do this, I need to tell you something about me.
what?
I'm not Nick halden.
my name's neal caffrey.
you and Kate lost everything?
Yeah. Adler paid well.
we put it right back into the company.
and why not?
everything he touched turned to gold.
he conned us. - He conned everybody... And then disappeared.
what happened after you told Kate the truth?
I thought this was about Adler.
well, I just got a few beers left, and I'm curious.
I taught her to survive.
Hey, you, stop!
someone stop that guy!
Freeze!
put your hands up!
Hey. Get up.
officer, this man stole my package.
I did no such thing.
whoa, whoa, be careful with that.
it's the falconer manuscript from the 16th century.
Hey, I recognize this guy.
how you doing, smedley?
this guy's got warrants out in three different states.
thanks to you, we can get him off the streets.
write him a receipt.
you can't take that.
it's worth a fortune.
we'll look after you, okay?
bring this to the 23rd precinct.
pick it up from evidence in a few days.
days? - 23rd.
I'm a little sick of being scalped every time we pull one of these.
you know, moz, you look better without the hairpiece.
very handsome.
Hale takes a cut.
we split the rest three ways. I don't know. It's not bad.
to all this.
to the best of times.
and to... Our villa on the cte d'azur, the sun setting over the mediterranean.
the olive trees whispering in the hills.
let's do it.
let's go.
now?
you want to go to france now? - Yeah.
look, that fbi agent -- Burke.
he's been asking around about the british pounds.
maybe -- I don't know.
maybe we should take some time away, outside the fbi's range.
we can start in cap d'antibes while it's still warm, work our way up to paris, over to amsterdam, then copenhagen.
I'm not going to copenhagen.
okay, I should've mentioned Alex.
this isn't about Alex, neal.
you can't just say, "hey, Kate, let's go to copenhagen for this opportunity" Alex told me about.
you just tried to con me.
I made a mistake, okay?
I'm doing this for us.
that music box is worth a fortune. It can give us the life we want.
you went to copenhagen without her. - Yeah.
the box was there.
but it was a three-person job. Without Kate, it fell apart.
Alex ended up in a french hospital, and I barely escaped.
but someone at the palace pointed the finger at you.
everyone thought you had the box.
I didn't correct them.
sure. It gave you great street cred.
I came back to new york.
Kate was gone.
well, she learned something from me,'cause she disappeared.
I started running big cons.
guess I was trying to get her attention.
well, you certainly got ours, steve tabernackle.
you knew about steve?
we knew a lot of things.
before returning to new york, caffrey popped up in denmark and france.
he's not afraid to cross borders.
he definitely does his homework.
we flagged his aliases at all ports of entry.
I mean, when we get a hit, we throw up roadblocks.
no, he'll never use the same i. d.Twice.
tell me something I haven't heard.
what about you? Agent...
you're on the run. How do I catch you?
stake out my girlfriend?
well, caffrey has one, right?
we think they split up.
well, but we know where she is.
does she know we're onto her? - No.
we've never had enough on her to bring her in.
and he hasn't gone anywhere near her.
hang on.
it took us months to catch her, and she never stays in the same place for more than a week.
she's hiding from him.
he doesn't know where she is.
Hey, ruby's in burma.
I'm gonna need a bush plane to get Oh, no. Did your pigeon die?
no, Estelle's fine -- Best homer in the city.
then what?
I received some news.
Some...information has surfaced on the street. - Kate?
you have to understand.
it comes from a highly unreliable source. - Where is she?
his name is Jimmy the snitch. - I need a location.
Neal, this smells like a trap. - I don't care. I need to see her.
it's a storage facility.
she'll be there this afternoon.
all right. Thanks.
be careful.
forging raphael.
you've gotten good.
I heard the real painting was stolen.
I hoped it would get your attention.
it did.
I missed you.
I lied to you about a lot of things, Kate, but I never lied about loving you.
I believe you.
I love you, too.
how did you find me?
well, moz heard you were fencing mauritian penny stamps.
I quit dealing in stamps.
it's okay.
hands on your head!
agent Burke.
you're under arrest.
I know.
thank you.
I never would have found her without you.
it's my pleasure.
so you guys were all in that municipal - van out front?
that's got to be uncomfortable.
doesn't smell too good, either.
and you know the rest.
all right, so what do we do next?
we find Adler. He's the key to this whole damn thing.
well, I've looked. His trail didn't go cold, Peter. Thereisno trail.
I caught you when I found out what you wanted most.
we know what he wants most.
the fractal.
what is this?
you have any ideas?
it must mean something, must point somewhere.
are you telling me the truth, neal?
why do you ask?
I only know one of your friends who's into origami.
Alex has been here.
and this receipt is from today.
what does she think it is?
it's a fractal antenna.
they're in everything now. There's one in your cellphone.
and this shape corresponds to a specific frequency for an emergency beacon.
emergency beacon?
you're telling me that if we build a real one of these and we hook that up to a radio
it's gonna lead us to a boat or a plane or something that disappeared in the 1940s.
Freeze!
drop the weapon!
don't move!
Freeze!
slide the knife to me.
she deserved to die.
she took everything I worked for.
slide the knife to me! Do it now.
Mac! Officer down.
I need a bus at 675 Bowery.
we caught the son of a bitch, Mac.
we got him... got him.
one WEEK LATER
Aah... geez...
this lovely stack of papers needs your signature.
Yeah. I'll do my best.
I'll have Adam pick it up later tonight.
you need all this stuff by tonight?
you show me no mercy.
also need you to take a look at this.
photo was lifted from security footage from a bar in Astoria, Queens.
Shane Casey's still posing as a cop.
Yeah. And he still has Danny's stolen badge and debit card.
got another hit on my debit card.
an ATM in Midtown.
Shane Casey.
this was last night, Mac.
we were investigating an unrelated shooting.
we're trying to track him down.
didn't you bring me any good news?
actually, I did.
breakfast.
something fabulous.
nice.
you're gonna have to live with the fact that you'll smell like garlic all day, but it might take the edge off your pain medication.
speaking of which, how are those ribs?
Oh, still broken.
what?
you know, it's like a soap opera in this complex over here.
I had no idea what was going on in the world in the middle of the day until I got marooned in this chair.
mac Taylor! You're spying on your neighbors!
that young lady over there
she's supposed to be in school.
she's about to get caught.
her mother's coming down the hall.
she's in trouble, big-time.
God, I miss being a teenager.
Yeah, me, too.
I was grounded every other weekend.
we're gonna need something to wash this down.
there's some bottled water in the fridge.
Oh, great. I got it.
okay, I've got two waters, and I brought two forks for those of us who are chopstick-challenged.
Oh. Great.
let's eat.
hurts to even inhale.
whoa.
Yeah, about $2, 000 in cash, but no wallet and no I. D.
and he had at least $200 more than that.
Yeah, when the bartender tried to check his I. D., our Vic said he forgot his wallet and gave him $200 in cash to let it slide.
bartender have any idea who did this? No.
he didn't even know there was an altercation.
another customer found the Vic when he came in to take a leak.
did you just use "take a leak
and "altercation" in the same sentence?
you know, I don't know what we're looking at here.
there's no gunshot or stab wounds, no sign of head trauma.
there's a bloody nose, but no swelling or bruising on the Vic's face to suggest he was even punched.
so maybe our guy knew how to duck and throw a couple jabs of his own.
no, don't think so.
there are no defensive injuries of any kind.
his fists are clean.
I don't think this guy landed a punch.
okay, so he wasn't the one looking for a fight.
that means the blood and skin on this mirror belong to our attacker, whose only weapon was his fist.
well... he must have missed with a jab, and then landed with a well-placed body shot that caused internal injuries and killed or Vic.
so why didn't our John Doe fight back?
fear? FLACK: This guy?
Hey, he was clearly sweating.
those are urine stains on his pants.
are you kidding me?
who could make a big strong guy like that scared enough to pee his pants?
those are some pretty rough-looking bruises you got on your hand there, big guy.
I work hard.
on what, breaking glass?
what that's supposed to mean?
your seven years of bad luck is starting right now, Mr. Picozzi.
this guy dead?
come on, you didn't realize how hard you hit him?
I didn't hit nobody.
I don't even know who this character is.
okay, so you didn't introduce yourself before you landed the punch that ended his life.
but you didn't have to know him to kill him.
I didn't kill nobody, lady.
I don't think he knows how this works.
see, we found your blood in the restaurant bathroom when we found his body.
center Street Grill ring a bell?
and unlucky for you, that blood got a hit in CODIS.
and you may be wondering how we got a match to you in our database.
you got a bunch of priors for violent assault.
is that your thing?
huh? You like beating people up?
that's your MO?
except, this time, you killed a man.
that's a bunch of crap.
you guys got this whole thing sideways. No, no.
what we got is your blood on a cracked mirror at a murder scene.
Yeah, 'cause I hit it. Not the guy. There was no guy.
all right. What happened?
I was at the grill, okay?
at the bar, drinking with my girl.
out of nowheres, the broad tells me she's pregnant.
inside, I'm freakin'.
I do the gentlemanly thing, excuse myself from the table, enter the bathroom and punch the living hell out of the mirror, 'cause I ain't ready to be a father.
that's a good story.
it's the truth, and I want a lawyer.
hmm. You know, Troy, innocent folks don't usually ask for a lawyer.
that's 'cause they're stupid and don't have the balls to sue you guys for false arrest.
no way.
no way.
is this really Namath's signature?
Yes.
put the football down, Adam.
not good to touch things...
I gotta get me one of these.
what is it?
it's a ball chain machine.
it's a rare and very fragile antique.
yeah?
you know, boss, I would have never imagined you'd have such cool stuff in your apartment.
well, it.. it... It's not that you're not cool, it's just...
you know, I just thought that, you know, well, you wouldn't be so, well, not so...
cool?
no. That is...
that's not what I meant...
are you done with those signatures?
Yes. We're good.
give you this.
and I'll take that.
it's a case file of a crime we picked up today.
and I'm outta here.
Adam... Yeah?
we have a name on this Vic?
no. Still John Doe.
when were we dispatched to the scene?
just after lunch.
no autopsy report?
Sid is still trying to determine the cause of death.
something wrong?
I believe I saw this guy this morning, in that apartment over there.
was he dead?
no. Very much alive.
let yourself out.
okay.
don't touch anything.
female VOICE The number you have called is not in service.
please check the number you've dialed.
I printed our Vic.
no hits in AFIS.
this guy is clean, and I mean really clean.
his body was coated with various disinfectants.
head to toe.
compulsive disorder? Possible germaphobe?
it would certainly be an extreme case.
we know cause of death? No.
I searched the torso for subdermal bruising, any broken bones or fatal internal injuries to major organs, and found nothing.
confirmed your analysis at the scene of no evidence of blunt-force trauma.
my next thought was heart failure or stroke.
right. Not the case.
this was a very healthy young man.
so he died at the scene of a fight, but wasn't in the fight. Right.
confirms Troy Picozzi's claim that he didn't hit him.
not the guy. There was no guy.
well, that leaves this eczematous-type reaction on the victim's left hand and wrist which, at this point, I can only say is symptomatic of some type of allergy.
that doesn't quite explain the nosebleed.
Lindsay confirmed that it was our John Doe's blood in the bathroom sink.
means the answer's in our tox results.
has to be.
of course, if that comes back negative, our Vic died of natural causes.
hello.
it took me a while to track down your number.
I-I... I'm in New York.
I know you're in New York.
you look great.
look out the window.
the building across the way. I'll wave.
when did you move in?
eight months ago.
so, what brought you back to New York?
a meeting of the Pathologists Association, and I have a charity benefit tomorrow afternoon.
get to catch up with some old friends.
you do look great.
how well do you know that guy?
Oh, he's just a friend.
Oh, well, there are plenty of really nice hotels in the city.
he had a spare room, and it...
just made things easier.
your escort to the charity benefit?
I hope you're following Dr. Hunter's orders.
????????????????????????????
she's got great taste in flowers.
an orchid.
in England, they're a symbol for beauty and love.
chinese believe they're a cure for illness.
Aubrey's a lovely name.
good beside manner?
how do you know this Kevin?
professor Scott.
he was a colleague of mine, when I was teaching at Chelsea University.
so what do you know about his background?
any arrests?
criminal record? Mac.
is this an interrogation?
there's been some strange things going on in his apartment the past few days.
have you been peering through your neighbors' windows?
a man was found dead yesterday afternoon.
a few hours before, he paid a visit to Kevin Scott.
um... I-I should go.
no. Listen, he brought home a canary.
I saw him dispense something from a dropper in the bottom of the bird's cage.
whatever it was, killed that bird.
is a brilliant Professor of mathematics.
he's an intelligent, funny, smart human being.
he's probably quite distressed that his bird and-and a man he possibly knows are both dead.
did he mention either one of them to you?
there is a briefcase and a canister somewhere in that apartment that can prove that he killed that bird.
mac, the thing that impressed me the most when I met you was your passion for your work...
but not everything is a crime.
it was really great to see you.
Peyton, listen to me for a second.
I'll-I'll let myself out.
I'll lock the door behind me.
I processed the Vic's clothing.
the fabric was covered in disinfectant.
that's the same result Sid got from the Vic's skin.
right. It was also on his watch, so I had Sid swab underneath where his watch would have been.
there was a void. No disinfectant.
which means the chemical was applied while he was wearing all of his clothes.
I know. It's like it was sprayed on him.
it stained some of his clothing.
doesn't make sense.
Hey, guys. I got tox results.
the eczema on our John Doe's left hand was a chemical burn.
a reaction to a very potent poison.
well, that explains the urine and the sweat stains.
and the nosebleed.
this poison have a name?
so far, no. Sid's trying to narrow it down.
but he did say it was the fumes from the poison that caused our victim's death.
it's deadly just breathing it in.
all right, we need to find out who this John Doe is, where he was before he died and if anybody else out there came in contact with this mystery poison.
curiosity got the best of her.
I knew you couldn't shake this, Peyton.
U u found it.
and no bird.
isn't it a crime to spy on your neighbors?
uh, from this distance? Nope.
not even a misdemeanor.
check the paper lining in the cage.
no trace?
nothing.
Peyton, what are doing?
that's it. You found it.
that's the case. Bring it over.
I'm not taking it out of his apartment.
hold on.
Oh, now you're showing off.
he's back.
Peyton, go to your phone.
Kevin Peyton?
Ah. Allergies.
I hope you don't mind, but I looked through your medicine cabinet.
no, of course. I just don't have any medication like that.
I know. I know. I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna run to the pharmacy and get something.
sure. Yeah.
okay.
so I'll, uh, see you later?
Yeah.
Hi, Stella. Mac, what are you two doing here?
Hey.
I think I may know a little something about your poison victim.
and I'm here to prove a man innocent.
I got a little Intel on Professor Scott.
he has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories.
sharing them with his students got him into a little trouble.
every university has at least one unconventional Professor.
Aw, come on, Peyton.
this guy's ideas here are...
totally anti-American.
look at this.
water fluoridation, tsunami bombs, chemtrails.
what are chemtrails?
well, some people believe that vapor exhaust from aircraft are actually dangerous biochemicals dispersed into the air.
which only proves that Kevin's a little odd.
prints from the tape lift show that both Kevin Scott and our John Doe touched the case, analysis of the paper on the bottom of the birdcage does not confirm evidence of poison.
thank you.
many poisons are highly volatile.
they can evaporate within minutes.
just because it wasn't detected, doesn't mean it wasn't there.
Scott's background says he was recently forced into retirement by the university.
eight months ago.
he stopped teaching.
he never mentioned it.
there were also two recent arrests for public disturbance.
none of what you're saying sounds like the man that I know.
well, we don't have anything that connects Kevin Scott to the poison, or to our John Doe's death.
Sid's autopsy report indicates a loss of blood from the Ne e of the victim.
that's the same thing I saw happen to the bird.
I think they were both victims of poison.
but without that case or canister, we can't prove it.
Yes, we can. If we e find that canary.
I'm going to go back to my apartment.
Lindsay, I'll need whatever you have left of the paper
Peyton collected from their cage.
and some wasps.
Peyton collected Okay. from Some what? e.
wasps have an incredible sense of smell.
a highly sensitive antennae.
why use wasps instead of dogs?
dogs attract attention.
mac doesn't want his neighbors to know that they're under surveillance.
dogs also take days instead of minutes to train, Adam.
so this ??? will actually be able to find that ???
the strong scent of the canary Dogs also Ta d day instead remains in the paper.
the other surrounds the cube and is the predominant smell as they eat the sugar.
so the wasps will associate the scent of the canary with the sweet taste of sugar.
that bird could be buried anywhere out there.
or not at all.
Scott came back to his apartment wearing work gloves.
from here, it looked like they were stained with some kind of rust-colored dirt.
if that bird is out there in that courtyard, these wasps will find it.
they can detect chemicals at very minute levels, down to parts per billion.
I could make this all much easier.
I could just ask Kevin, over dinner, if he happened to kill his bird and his friend.
and ruin all the fun?
well, it's been 15 minutes.
I think these guys are ready.
what's that?
a wasp hound.
you're gonna walk the wasps.
huh. Me?
you.
are they doing anything yet? No movement.
Hey, wait. Right there.
hold it.
they're definitely getting excited about something.
keep walking.
necropsy findings on the bird.
as you can see, there were high levels of isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate detected in the bird's brain tissue.
a metabolite of... sarin.
Yeah. Synthetic nerve Agent.
500 times more potent than cyanide.
clear, colorless and has no odor.
easily absorbed in the skin and inhaled.
Sheldon, Sid suggested that the victim had an allergy.
Yeah, originally thought to be an eczematous reaction, but could have been a chemical burn, or a result of contact with sarin.
which means that there's a possibility that your John Doe poisoned himself without even knowing it.
which means that the poisoning was accidental, not murder.
Yeah, but what about the bird?
also an accident?
it was Scott's way of testing his poison's effectiveness.
whether he killed our John Doe or not, he's definitely got something planned.
okay, well, all of this should be enough to get us a search warrant for his apartment, right?
if a few drops of sarin can kill a person in a matter of seconds...
we need to find out where Kevin Scott is and exactly what he has planned.
all right, so, Missing Persons got a match to our Vic.
his name is Ivan Paluck, and he worked at Hedge Island.
it's located off the northeast coast of Gardner's Bay, but it's unidentified on most maps.
there's a government animal disease research lab out there.
fancy name for a germ laboratory.
A17. Highly restricted.
they study rare biological elements for military use and education.
this is all making sense now, Danny.
the disinfectant on Paluck's skin and clothes was a result of the precautions that the lab would have taken to protect its workers.
Ivan Paluck smuggled the sarin off the island,
Danny, and he was working with Kevin Scott.
boss.
I just sent you a video from my phone.
run an analysis on it right away.
see if you can determine what Kevin Scott is saying and what number he called.
have Flack get a warrant.
call me when you get something.
Kevin Scott-- NYPD. Open up!
boss. Adam.
I got something else for you.
blueprints?
of what?
that's what I need you to get Lindsay to find out.
Hey, guys, what do we have? Hey.
I enhanced the video that file Mac sent over, and I got six of the seven digits that Professor Scott was dialing.
that narrows it down to possibly ten numbers.
right. Nine of whom were a dead end, but the tenth one, that was a real winner.
came back to Ivan Paluck.
I compared it to a DMV photo of the Vic, and I got a match.
if Kevin Scott was calling Paluck, means he had no idea he was dead.
also the video file that Mac sent over had no audio, so I used a lip-reading software.
I'll be there tonight.
it's on.
sounds like he's confirming some sort of prearranged meeting.
something's going down tonight.
we just need to figure out where.
I think this could help.
the blueprint from Scott's apartment was labeled, but the letters are too faded to read.
I used a laser to raise a latent print but...
...this is all I got.
any chance we can buy a vowel?
from the looks of the architectural design on the blueprint, I'm thinking it's an older building.
Conserv... Conservatory!
okay, run the blueprints against Microsoft Photosynth Mapping.
we might be able to get a 3-D match.
okay. I'll start with conservatories in Manhattan.
there we go.
Manhattan Enrichment Conservatory.
that's gotta be where Scott's headed.
mac, inhalation is the fastest way to poison all those people with sarin, if that Scott's intent.
he'll more than likely go through the air-conditioning system in the building.
I need to know exactly where the air-conditioning vents are.
one is on the East side of the building in a compressor room on the eighth floor.
the main compressor is on the roof.
we're 84 at the conservatory.
I don't want to scare him off.
keep all sector cars out of the area and notify FDNY.
I don't want to hear any sirens. Yeah, I'm on it.
Flack, go around to the freight elevator in the back.
make your way up to the roof. Done.
Peyton had plans to be at this event.
I'll find her.
you keep a low profile.
if he's in there, you see him before he sees you, all right?
I'm on it.
I'll find the security camera monitors.
excuse me. Peyton.
Mac. Did he meet you here?
no, I haven't seen or heard from him.
come with me.
Stella, got eyes on Professor Scott.
he's dressed in a security guard uniform.
he's entering a doorway at the West end of stairwell number four.
Where's it lead to?
Danny, it's a stairwell that leads to all floors. And the roof.
looks like he already got to the security guard.
is he still alive?
Danny, he killed a security guard.
be careful.
let's see if we can find him.
that's him.
that's Kevin.
I can't believe that he's doing this.
he's on the sixth floor.
Danny, he's three floors above you.
he's heading past the ninth floor.
Danny, he's definitely headed to the roof.
be careful.
copy that, Mac. Flack, he's headed your way.
that's far enough, Professor.
lose the container.
get on your knees and put your hands behind your head now.
Danny, I got him.
copy that. I'm on my way.
don't make me say it again.
lose the container, put your hands behind your head.
do it now!
don't move! - That's it! Right there!
don't move!
we're not ready.
no one is ready for biological warfare.
our citizens-- they're not safe.
you're not safe.
I've proved that.
if I can get a deadly gas into a room full of political dignitaries without detection, imagine what our enemies can do.
I mean...
wake up, people.
I've done you a favor. Look around you.
they are among us.
and they are planning their next attack.
it's the only way he'd agree to a confession.
thinks we're gonna upload it onto Youtube or something.
his mission statement.
that guy's crazy.
no one is safe.
these cuffs
they-they just prevent me from helping you.
thank you.
I didn't want to be right about Kevin Scott, Peyton.
wasn't exactly how I imagined I'd see you again.
everything about the two of us was always unpredictable.
that's why it was so great.
I'm so sorry for the way I ended everything.
you deserved so much better than that.
I needed to be with my family in London, and I... I didn't want to change my mind.
I didn't want to have to see you, look you in the eye...
and choose between you and them.
I understand the choice you made.
I just don't understand how you handled it.
you gave me no chance.
and I missed you.
so...
Dr. Aubrey...
do you like her?
Dr. Hunter?
we're just friends.
we started out as just friends.
you jealous?
Yeah.
good.
I'm still wounded here, you know.
you can see an awful lot through this window.
this is going to be good.
all units, aerial surveillance advises suspects are fleeing west on Temple with a van full of stolen goods.
robbery Homicide unit two responding. We are in pursuit.
copy that. - Let's roll.
we are in pursuit, right?
Yeah, what, this music help get you in the game?
I got you. Here we go; let's go.
bam.
Yeah, let's go. Let's go, baby.
Yeah!
I am in the game.
a good pursuit, Travis, a good pursuit requires some thought.
Oh, a good pursuit requires balls.
requires balls. All right, come on, you got a beat sound system.
you can only get it in this car; let's go.
all you listen to is jazz.
let's go. Come on.
Yeah. Head like that.
jazz promotes concentration and analysis.
if you'd analyze the situation... If you'd analyze the situation, you'd realize that these guys are going west on Temple, which means they're probably headed for the 101, right?
but, of course, the entrance to the 101 is closed for construction. See?
which means we can just wait.
do you ever get tired of being you?
occasionally.
often, actually.
but somebody's got to do it.
LAPD! Put your hands out of the car. Get them out!
let's go!
dad, I am a woman now, and I'm capable of making my own decisions.
and I've decided to marry Owen, and I don't know why you won't accept that.
but you are incapable of making an adult decision.
I mean, Owen?
he's irresponsible.
he's... lazy.
he's a good-time Charlie, and that's fine.
I don't have a problem with that.
he's not husband material.
Dakota and I love each other.
Owen, you don't know what love is.
and furthermore, furthermore...
I can't keep doing this.
can't keep doing this.
we've been doing these weird role-playing exercises for the last three sessions, and by my count, this is the third time someone's asked me to play the cold, withholding father.
meanwhile, Travis here gets cast as the cool, romantic, you know, love interest.
does it bother you that the group sees you as an authority figure?
no, it bothers me that this group has such a problem with authority.
okay, look, I-I just don't... I-I don't know her father.
I've never met him; how am I supposed to portray him? What's the point?
it's a fair question; in a sense, you all have been studying for the last three weeks.
preparing to take on the role of a lifetime.
your partner.
this week, I want you all to try switching places with each other, as it were.
because by becoming them, we can start to understand them better and ourselves.
all right, enough talk.
I'd like you to stand up and switch chairs with your partners.
this is stupid. - Yeah.
he's good.
that's spot on.
what are you talking about?
he's being you.
I know he's being me, but that's not me.
uh, that sure looks like you.
I don't sit like that.
Wes, I invite you to respond as Travis.
I don't care what these good-time Charlie people have to say.
I don't care what any of you all have to say.
this is stupid.
okay, all right, I don't talk like that.
I don't talk to people that way, and I don't sound like that.
like that. - That.
I don't talk like that.
can we take a time-out?
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
please help me.
he forced his way in.
he kept hitting me.
are you safe now?
is your attacker there?
I don't know.
his name's Kevin Boyd.
ma'am? Ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing? - Are you still there?
help me! Please help me.
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
ma'am? Ma'am...!
I think this role-playing exercise is gonna be good for us.
unlikely, since I have no plan of doing it.
that's the beautiful thing; you don't have to do anything.
I'm gonna show you what it's like to work with you.
Oh, you're gonna be professional, disciplined and on point?
I find that highly unlikely.
there you go, you cast yourself in the role of the enforcer of the world's standards.
I think you mean well; you just don't realize you're coming off like a dick.
who put this tape here?
field manual clearly states to establish
see? They resent you.
it's not me.
besides, it's seven yards, guys.
sobering mirror, my friend. Sobering mirror.
congratulations, guys, you just caught the world's easiest clearance.
what makes you say that?
woman named Beth Boyd owns this place.
someone broke in here last night, tied her up and tuned her up, and then they strangled her.
why does that make this the world's easiest clearance?
she managed to place a 911 call before she died.
she gave us the name of her attacker.
a guy named Kevin Boyd, her husband.
we've already got APBs out for him.
things must have really gone bad between these two.
have I thought about visiting harm upon my ex?
Yeah, sure, but... - That'll be all, officer.
and, uh, make sure you pay for that cupcake.
I already did.
but thank you for checking, dick.
Oh, my God.
who is that?
that's the victim's stepsister.
we called her down here to identify the body.
Yes, that's her. That's my sister.
I'm extremely sorry for your loss, ma'am.
but if you're up for it, I need to ask you a couple questions.
Beth made a 911 call before she died.
she said her husband did this to her.
you don't seem very surprised.
I wish I were.
Kevin and Beth are...
were still married, but only because they couldn't settle on the terms of their divorce.
Beth kind of hated Kevin, and he gave it back to her in spades.
and they had to see each other every day.
Why?
he owns the place next door.
Beth and Kevin bought this whole row of storefronts back when things were better, but when-when things went south, they couldn't decide how to split it all up, so they just...
they dug in.
they've been in court for years.
do you know where Kevin might be right now? Our officers can't find him at the address we have on file.
well, if he snapped and hurt Beth, I-I don't know.
maybe he's running.
Hey, Suzanne!
you son of a bitch.
Suzanne, what's going on?
son of a bitch!
Kevin Boyd? - Yeah. What the hell is going on here?
so, you can't remember where you were last night?
I drink sometimes, okay? It's not good, I know.
but the divorce and the shop, it's just so much stress.
come on.
okay. I closed up my store.
I walked two doors down to Northbrook for a whiskey.
and that was, um, 7:30.
I ordered another drink, and that's the last thing I remember.
okay, I woke up in Van Nuys behind the wheel of my car, and that was about 8: 00 this morning.
Kevin, your wife called 911 at 12: 13 a. m. last night.
your alibi leaves a rather large window of time unaccounted for.
Yeah, I know, but I didn't kill Beth, okay?
I'm not an animal. - Yeah?
why'd your wife file a complaint for assault, Kevin.
that was five years ago, okay?
I just... I grabbed her too hard.
it's not right; I was drinking that night.
you were drinking last night.
Kevin, you and your wife were tied up in what, like, five different lawsuits?
there was the divorce; she sued you for failing to maintain the greens outside your store.
so, you sued her for defamation; she came back...
Yeah, we hated each other, okay? I'm not denying it.
Kevin, that's enough.
officers, my client is going through a painful divorce, but that's not evidence that he committed any crime.
Yeah, how's this?
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
please help me.
he forced his way in. He kept hitting me.
are you safe now?
is your attacker there?
I don't know.
his name is Kevin Boyd.
Oh, my God, I... - Yeah.
Hey, look, I don't know what to tell you.
I mean, that's definitely Beth's voice, but I don't think I'm that kind of man.
look, I'll cooperate however you need, okay?
I'll give you DNA.
you don't have to agree to that.
I want to.
if I... did that.
I deserve whatever I get.
I'll tell you what we'll do, Kevin.
we'll take a sample here, we'll compare it to what we have at the crime scene.
what is that on the back of your hand.
Oh... Looks like a mark from Red Lace.
it's a burlesque club up on La Brea.
I go there sometimes when I drink.
I didn't have this yesterday.
look, maybe Beth was wrong.
maybe, maybe I was at this club last night.
so, this guy doesn't know where he was last night.
and he wants us to run down his alibi for him.
well, I admit, Kevin looks guilty.
but if he was at that strip club last night, he didn't kill Beth.
Wes, please. Red Lace is a burlesque show.
those women are dancers.
thought you had more respect for the arts.
please. Taking your clothes off is not art.
Oh, I see what you did there.
you lay a little trap for me.
when you keep lining them up, I keep slamming them home.
stop, stop, stop, please?!
I have been telling you not to slip your ballet moves into this routine.
look, you want art?
go rent yourself a place over on Franklin.
put on a show there.
sorry, Ed.
I don't know, Ed, it looked pretty good to me.
can we talk?
you don't have to talk to them, Ed.
they amended the city code, these guys are suppose to schedule their spot inspections now.
you can sue them for harassment.
we're not code inspectors.
we're LAPD homicide. You a lawyer?
law student.
is that so surprising?
no. No it isn't so surprising, Ms... Destiny.
ms. Destiny? I know a think or two about the law myself.
here we go.
I speak lawyer.
and isn't it true, that the present code as been reammended?
I'm positive.
the judge that I clerk for, had me pull the papers last week.
and you are just digging yourself in deeper.
I could make a case against you for tortfeasance with intent.
you should know that the punitive damages for that can run the gamut.
if you're going to pretend to be me, you better have the knowledge to back it up.
have you scene this gentleman in your club last night?
uh, oh, yeah, that's Kevin.
he's in here all the time.
Yeah, he was in here last night for a few hours.
I remember because he was throwing down lots of tip money.
usually, he's kind of cheap.
what time did he leave?
I saw him leave, uh, right as the curtain went up on the midnight show.
Beth Boyd placed that 911 call at 12: 13.
Larchmont's about a mile from here give or take.
Kevin could have left the club and been at the store just in time.
Kevin say anything about where he was going?
Ed? - Hm?
withholding information from a homicide investigation is obstruction of justice.
now, you wanna go to jail?
he said he wanted to keep his night going.
he was spending so much money so I referred him over to my friends place.
it's kind of a casino-type operation.
they're kind of loose with the permits over there.
not strictly, um...
...legal.
well, they're open for business.
or they're about to be condemned.
you know, guys in my law firm use to love places like this.
they're shabby on the outside, slick on the inside.
Yeah, just the opposite of the clientele.
all right. Well, BMW's in.
wait, wait, hold on. - What?
it's the music.
I just... The interplay between the bass and the piano.
you get tired of this, yet? - It's exquisite.
you've been doing this for hours now.
wait, wait, wait, okay, here comes the bridge.
all right, enough of this.
you think you're proving some kind of point to me?
do you want to know why I have to pay such attention to the rules, Travis?
it's because I'm partnered with a maniac.
you wanna know what that's like? You wanna know what that's like?
I'll show you.
yeah...
yeah... Evening, sweetheart.
sweetheart? - Sweetheart?
look, uh, my friend and I are feeling lucky tonight.
we heard this was the place to be.
nobody drives through there without a password.
Oh, a password.
the password is, uh,"hot tub.
as in, you, me, bubbles.
go ahead.
Thanks, darlin'.
what are you doing, man?
this is your game, right?
what?
kinda scary not knowing what your partner is going to do next, isn't it?
excuse me!
how you guys doing?
okay, okay, everybody looks very nice today.
LAPD. LAPD. Back up.
LAPD-- Where you going?
where you going?
look, my partner and I just have a few questions to ask you guys.
damn. - And y'all better damn well answer them or...
you go, girl.
...everybody here's gonna wake up in jail tomorrow.
got it?
Yep.
that's right. I just broke a glass for no apparent reason.
boom!
all right, listen up, douche bags.
we need information, and you all are going to give it to us, or each and every one of you is going to take a ride downtown, and I think you know what I mean by "downtown.
you hear me, douche bags?
you said douche bags already.
okay, here's what we want:
we want to know if anyone has seen this guy here last night. Hmm?
uh, I recognize that guy.
we got here at the same time.
and what time, perchance, was that?
uh, I don't know. - Excuse me, sir?
what? - We have cameras on the door.
if you want to take a look, you can see what time he got here.
just, please, don't break anything else.
now, I never forget a face, so I don't want anybody here...
...causing any trouble.
trouble. Half of us are optometrists.
you, zip it.
Thanks, hon. - "Hon"?
easy, cowboy.
you're just jealous because I'm more you than you are.
please.
Hey, look, we got what we came for, right?
Kevin came here at 12: 24 last night.
last 911 call came in at 12: 13.
that leaves Kevin 11 minutes to kill his wife drive here and start gambling.
is that even possible?
if he had a helicopter.
I'll tell you what, Kevin's bail hearing is tomorrow morning.
if I was his defense attorney and I had that kind of timeline to work with,
I could definitely get him out.
if he couldn't have done it, then why did Beth finger him for the call?
maybe the killer had a mask on?
maybe she never saw his face and just assumed it was Kevin.
let me ask you this: besides that phone call does Kevin seem like a killer to you?
he practically cried when we played him the 911 tape, and he volunteered his DNA.
no. Not really.
maybe it's time we started figuring out who else wants Beth dead.
you know what?
this was fun.
I think it was a valuable object lesson for you.
you just like pretending to be me.
I'm the one teaching lessons here, and tomorrow, ugh... school's back in session, baby.
I guess I should commend you on diving into your homework.
thank you.
something tells me that the two of you have managed to turn this into a competition.
that's not commendable?
I think you look sharp, son.
you really make that suit.
Oh, yes. - Yes, you do.
Yeah, you...
last night, I played Travis to a tee, might I add, and I guess this is his way of upping the ante.
you didn't play me.
you played yourself.
he just let out everything that he keeps all bottled up.
it just all came out like a volcano.
you can't... - You know what?
this is actually a good thing.
it is?! - Yes.
I mean, right now, you're just playing caricatures of each other, but if you stick with this, you will end up learning about each other whether you want to or not.
we don't really do the learning.
Yeah, it's kind of an unwritten rule in our thing.
Yeah, well, that's why you're here.
Ah... You cleaned your desk.
I don't get it. This should be making me happy.
you're not capable of happiness, but recognizing its absence is a good start.
we're making progress.
something's wrong with this picture.
what's with the suit?
role play week in therapy, Captain.
role play week.
I remember it. Not bad.
he's just wearing a suit, Cap.
Yeah, but I think he captures the essence of you.
take a look at this.
that new girl down in digital forensics, she stopped by.
she says you asked her to comb through Beth Boyd's hard drive.
now, Beth lodged a couple of harassment complaints against an ex-con, named Carl Battier.
battier already had a couple of aggravated assaults in his file.
after his last stretch, he got a job delivering ingredients to that cupcake store every evening.
so the cupcake lady thought he was harassing her.
well, she was e-mailing back and forth with a lawyer, trying to get a restraining order against this Battier character.
but she dropped it once the delivery company let him go.
Where's he working now?
it's all in there.
sorry, guys. I don't get paid if I don't spin the sign.
so somebody killed the cupcake lady.
that's terrible.
I meant to stop back in there, I mean, after she had a cooling-ff period, - and-and say thanks.- Thanks?
she got you fired.
you're dressed like a hot dog.
Yeah, this gig's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I get to stand out in the sun, breathe the fresh air, meet people.
what's up, man?
can you tell us where you were at midnight on Tuesday?
sir. - "Sir?
it's a term of respect.
is that a problem? I...
no. I usually just don't... get... "sir.
I don't know, you just look... distinguished.
terribly.
all right, look, I was home, I live alone,
I'm a felon on minimum wage, but I didn't kill that lady.
like I said, I was grateful to her.
I get to put on this suit, and the old Carl kind of disappears, and I can become a different guy.
you feel me?
Yes, we feel you. Excuse us.
you know, I actually think he's telling the truth.
Beth Boyd's forensic screen came back in.
she had someone's skin under her fingernails.
the DNA's a match for Kevin.
so he killed Beth and got over to that club in 11 minutes?
I know, I know, it doesn't make any sense to me, either.
but that's what the test says.
Kevin's lawyer got him out on bail this morning.
he could be anywhere.
we gotta get all hands on deck and try and track him down.
Yep.
all units, be on the lookout for Kevin Boyd, last seen in the vicinity of 1277 Larchmont.
Kevin's holed up inside his wife's store?
Yeah. One of the guys saw him sneaking in through the back.
anyone else gone in?
he told us he was going to blow the place if we got any closer.
blow the place?
Yeah. He can't live knowing that he's a murderer.
he gave us 20 minutes to evacuate the area.
Kevin's gonna commit suicide.
I told you people to stay out of here.
Kevin. You don't want to do this.
I absolutely do.
and you don't want to be here for it, so get out!
I killed Beth.
I killed my wife.
Kevin, we don't know that for sure.
I got these scratch marks, and I don't where I got them from, but my lawyer said they found my DNA under Beth's fingernails, so, it kind of adds up, doesn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
but Kevin, my partner and I-- we don't agree on much.
we argue all the time.
it's kind of our thing.
we put a lot of murderers in jail, and neither one of us is convinced that you did it.
how can you say that?
she named me in the phone call, okay.
my DNA was under her fingernails.
Kevin. The physical evidence is stacked against you, and that's why we got to bring you in.
but think about it.
the time line doesn't make any sense.
you had 11 minutes to get from here to that casino.
on Vine.
nobody could get over there that fast.
seems hard to believe, right?
and I'll tell you what else.
you just don't seem like a killer to us, Kevin.
killers don't offer up their DNA.
killers don't give police 20 minutes to evacuate innocent people.
then how did this happen?
we don't know, but if you didn't do it, your DNA had to get there somehow.
so, you're saying I was set up?
well... it's definitely possible.
think about it.
you blacked out for a long time.
takes more than a few drinks to do that.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
so... what, I was drugged?
well, we just don't know, Kevin.
give up, let us take you in.
we'll run a tox screen, we'll find out.
but if you don't, you're gonna die here thinking that you murdered your wife?
you don't want that.
pass me the lighter.
all right, all right, let's get you.
let's get out of here.
Oh, shoot. - What?
I was afraid I was gonna chicken out with the lighter, so I set the pilot light to turn on after 20 minutes.
are you okay? - Yeah.
what are you gonna do tomorrow?
what do you mean?
well, I know you don't own more than one suit.
what are you, hung over?
what do you mean?
your hair is a mess, and you're dressed like you just rolled out of bed.
it's a thing we're doing for therapy.
role-play.
when Travis gets here, I'm gonna show him what it's like when the professional partner
I.e.me-- is saddled with a ill-dressed malcontent.
what?
good morning, Jonelle.
so, what do you think?
you'd make a good grownup.
it's too bad it's just a costume.
let me guess. A contest?
only in the sense that Wes is getting his ass kicked.
only one suit, huh?
let me help you guys cut to the chase with all this what-have-you.
you two, as messed up as you both indeed are, need each other.
Wes, you need Travis to be Travis, so you can be you.
you don't need Travis to be more like you, whether you realize it or not.
that's deep.
same thing goes for you, too.
that's just stupid.
honestly, Jonelle, we appreciate it, but we're not here for pop psychology.
we're here for real science.
Really? - Fine.
I don't envy your therapist.
but since I don't get to do a tox screen on a living suspect instead of a dead victim every day, here you go.
somebody gave a whopping dose of flunitrazepam to Kevin Boyd.
it's a roofie.
they gave him the date rape drug?
what's the last place Kevin remembers before he blacked out?
uh, he had a drink at Northbrook, that restaurant just down the street from his store.
all right, thank you.
uh, Travis? - Huh?
yeah? - You, um...
you got a... price tag on your suit.
he got a good deal.
all right, thanks for coming in, Miss Hecht.
I understand you have some questions about what happened to Beth?
Yes. Your restaurant, Northbrook
it's down the block from your sister's cupcake store, correct?
that's right.
Beth and Kevin gave me a deal on the lease back when I was getting started.
well, it seems like your restaurant's the last place Kevin remembers the night that Beth died.
he showed up for drinks at, what was it, 7:00?
was it 7: 00?
mm, around there.
7: 30. - 7: 30?
mm, that's right.
he had, uh... two drinks.
started getting all pissed off at Beth, at me.
then he just left.
couldn't have been any later than ten minutes till.
we ran a tox screen on Kevin.
turns out someone slipped him a roofie that night.
look, um... none of this matters now.
it doesn't change anything that happened.
so I'll just tell you.
I told Beth that Kevin was coming over that night.
she asked me to do her a favor.
she gave me a bottle of whiskey and asked me to make sure that I served him from that bottle.
you did?
I just thought she was gonna play a trick on him, you know?
like, maybe slip him that stuff that makes you sick to your stomach.
Kevin was really hard on her.
if she wanted to play dirty, I wasn't gonna ask any questions.
she was my sister.
why would she dose Kevin?
maybe she just... She wanted him to pass out, I guess, so she could get the DNA and frame him for the assault?
but instead, he... he blacked out.
and he killed her.
so Beth Boyd slipped her husband a Mickey.
none of it adds up to another suspect in her murder.
well, we're not sure.
we know that Beth got her sister to dose Kevin.
does that mean Beth is a suspect?
in her own murder?
well, she didn't necessarily mean to kill herself.
think about it, Cap.
she's tied up in this brutal litigation with her Kevin.
if she stages an attack and gets Kevin convicted of a felony, then she gets everything.
I'm sorry. What-what is that?
my new white noise machine.
waves... birds... chimes...
it gives me clarity of thought.
that's great, Cap.
what Wes was getting at before being Wes got in the way was maybe Beth's death was an accident.
she set up Kevin to be convicted of an assault, and she never said he was trying to kill her on the 911 call.
as she's making the call, she drops the phone and her chair falls over.
she strangles herself.
she trussed herself to the chair?
try proving that one.
well, first we have to see if it's even possible and then we can worry about proving it.
you said you liked role-play, right, Cap?
all right, we got the pile hitch. What's next?
okay, Cap, you got the bowline knot all ready to go?
okay. Here's what you're gonna do.
you're gonna take the end of that rope, throw it over your shoulder, tuck it underneath these ropes around your chest and back in front of you.
hit it.
I gotta say I'm pretty impressed, Cap.
I gotta give credit to my first wife, Cindy.
yeah? She taught you how to tie knots, huh?
Cindy liked to role-play as well.
she loved that hostage/ freedom fighter scenario.
what do you want? It was the '70s.
I can't do it. It can't be done.
okay, all right, Cap, relax.
let me see that. All right.
all right, underneath... that goes under here, back up through the bowline.
through... There's just no way Beth tied herself to that chair.
wait.
look at the knots.
they're backwards.
cap tied himself to this chair, and he's right-handed.
whoever tied Beth to the chair's a lefty.
Kevin Boyd is right-handed.
so there was someone else in that bakery with Beth.
it wasn't Kevin Boyd.
911. What's your emergency?
I've been attacked. Please help me!
he forced his way in... - 911. What's your emergency?
I have been through everything, and there is absolutely no forensic evidence that anyone other than Beth or Kevin was in that room.
is your attacker there?
why do you keep listening to it, Travis?
we've heard it a dozen times.
I don't know.
you know? I'm playing you, right?
I'm playing you. - Isn't that what you do?
just keep reviewing the evidence over and over again until you're certain that this innocent person isn't going away?
you know, that almost sounded like a compliment.
you're lucky I'm in a bad mood. Otherwise it never would have happened.
no, no, no, wait, wait.
play it again.
Why? You just said we've listened to it a dozen times.
Yeah, I know I said that but we know more now.
we know someone else was in that room.
listen to Beth's voice on this.
911, what's your emergency?
I've been attacked.
see, she's talking to that 911 operator right now.
everything's going according to plan.
is your attacker there?
right... there, she falls.
ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing?
now she doesn't have that phone anymore.
and it doesn't sound like she's talking to that 911 operator anymore.
sounds like she's talking to whoever else is in that room.
Beth didn't expect to start choking.
so she's begging for help.
listen to it again.
okay everybody shut up for a minute.
is your attacker there?
there is a pause between the first and second time she says "help me.
ma'am, are you still there?
what are you doing?
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
there. The killer said something to her.
Yeah, let's get the recording down to digital forensics.
see if they can drop the operator's voice out and boost up the background noise.
what are you doing?
I need your address.
please, ma'am, tell me where you are.
I'm sorry.
please help me.
I'll be damned.
a woman killed Beth Boyd.
Ivy, make sure you tell your customers we've 86'd the goat cheese salad, okay?
Thanks.
guys, you really should have called first.
this is not a good time.
that's okay.
we brought Beth's personal effects.
we thought you might like to have them back.
thank you. - Yeah.
Oh, you know what? She has to sign for them.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.
sign right there.
okay. Left-handed?
E-excuse me.
statue of Liberty?
no. I'm you today. I get to do the takedown.
stop you're under arrest!
Hi, there.
you're under arrest.
you hit her with the cart.
technically, you hit her with the cart.
see, we're role-playing.
it's a long story.
you okay?
you good enough to roll over?
these suits are uncomfortable, man.
Yeah, welcome to my world. - Oh, man.
so Suzanne collaborated with Beth to frame me?
Yeah.
you took the roofie, and passed out long enough for Beth to get your skin under her fingernails.
as far as Beth knew, it was just supposed to be an assault.
you know, you go to jail, she'd get everything.
but Suzanne's restaurant was bleeding money.
so she figured with Beth out of the picture, she'd own the property...
and all her troubles would be over.
sorry, Kevin.
look, I know you guys were having your problems but Beth was your wife.
how do we get so far away from who we used to be?
I have to make some changes.
big ones. Thank you.
seriously.
you guys believed in me even when I was ready to write myself off.
good luck, Kevin.
Oh, man. I'm so tired of this thing.
it's not easy being me, is it?
I already cracked the case by being you.
you didn't crack the case being me.
I was the one listening to that tape?
I was the better... I was the one that discovered the pause in the tape.
you wouldn't have heard the pause...
that's something... - ...if I wasn't listening to the tape.
all you could figure out was that I did the pen thing.
listen, man, I can see through that shirt. - That's pathetic.
and I look better in this shirt than you do.
so I take it you're done with the role-playing?- Yeah.
it's an interesting experiment.
but it ran its course. - Yeah.
do you think that either of you learned anything from it?
what? No. - Absolutely not.
okay. Does anyone else want to share their experience?
wait. - Yes, Travis?
Yes, Travis, is there something you'd like to share with the group?
there was that thing that Jonelle said.
Oh, come on, not that.
okay, she said that I need Wes to be Wes so I can be me.
and vice versa.
and makes a lot of sense if you really think about it.
why is that?
well, uh... I'm the kind of guy who flies by the seat of his pants.
I take things as they come.
and there are times, there are moments when it's probably a good thing that Wes is around to help get things squared away.
that's true.
all right, all right, I'll concede that I can get a little lost in my head sometimes and Travis helps to push things along.
and, um, in some cases I may overanalyze if Travis weren't around.
that is so cute.
you guys need each other.
I didn't say we needed... - That's not what he said, woman.
I mean... - I said, I over analyzing...
congratulations, guys.
you really applied yourselves to this.
this is your first real breakthrough.
how does it feel?
feeling like you tricked us.
Absolutely. 100% trickery.
we choose to go to the moon.
we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things.
not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
look at that. - That's beautiful.
this is one of the most thrilling moments of my life I guarantee you.
the great adventure of going to the moon may never happen again in our life.
manned space flight will continue...
and there is adventure to be found in high Earth orbit.
robots have already gone to other worlds:
the valleys of Mars, the clouds and moons of Jupiter.
there is a brand of adventure to be had in such a long-distance mode of human participation.
but the satisfaction and the sudden emptiness of an adventure completed are intangible human concepts.
the argument can be made that mankind cannot bear witness to an event...
unless one of mankind has experienced the adventure firsthand.
not necessarily first, mind you, just firsthand.
it is certainly not necessary to be Neil Armstrong to have experienced the great adventure found in a voyage from the Earth to the moon.
Hey, Beano, turn around and give me a big smile!
my name is Al Bean.
that's me, standing in the Ocean of Storms on November 21, 1969.
there I am again, five very heady days later...
aboard our recovery ship where they set up a quarantine trailer...
for me and my two crewmates: Pete Conrad, my skipper...
and Dick Gordon, our command module pilot.
they were Gemini veterans who are about as cool as they come.
everyone knew they'd be going to the moon, unlike me.
this was my first space flight.
I would be forever known as the fourth man to set foot on the lunar surface.
Pete and Dick wanted to be on the first landing...
but I'd have been happy to be on the 93rd.
funny, Beano. You're a dead man!
crying out loud, I had the President of the United States calling me.
good morning, Mr. President.
me, Al Bean. Last guy in his astronaut group to even fly.
we take our jobs very seriously. - The commander in chief promoted all three of us to Navy captains.
thank you very much, sir. Yes, sir.
congratulations, Captain Bean. Captain Gordon.
captain Conrad. Captain Bean. - Captain Conrad. Captain Gordon.
people were treating me with great care...
making sure we hadn't come home with any alien diseases.
careful not to puncture his brain, Doc.
that is very funny, Dick. You're a very funny pilot.
we hadn't, but one of the cameras conked me pretty good during splashdown.
it was my own damn fault.
I was supposed to remove it and put it under my seat...
like it said on the checklist.
I guess I was so happy the parachutes had worked that I said...
I'll just leave it there on its window mount.
that is stupid.
if it had hit me in the center of the forehead...
it would have probably killed me...
which would have been a really sad situation.
hit the breakers. - I'm doing it.
what? - Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so. I'm fine.
did you get knocked out? - What?
actually, I had, but I didn't realize it until later.
hell, the whole trip I didn't have too much luck with cameras.
I'll explain that later.
bump or not, I was alive and well. So were my friends.
we made it, and we made it well.
let me disinfect that for you. - Ow!
maybe we weren't dignified enough to be heroes. lt wouldn't matter.
cause we were the second mission to land on the moon.
history's ultimate anticlimax.
somehow, I fit right in.
flying with Pete and Dick was the sweetest thing about the mission for me.
we were a true team.
at one point, I even kind of saved the day.
I didn't know what to expect. I was a complete rookie.
we'd done countless simulated launches...
so I did the same things I did during all of those.
Roger, STC. Main bus tie bat B/C switch, on, up.
I kept busy checking the console...
making sure our command module, Yankee Clipper, was ready to go.
looks like this launch is gonna be a wet one.
no big deal for an all-Navy crew. We can handle it.
the rain was considered a bother, but nothing to worry about.
Apollo 12, you are go for launch.
Roger. Go for launch.
me and my best buddies were ready for the adventure of a lifetime.
al Bean, you are going to the moon.
y'all can come along if you like.
we have ignition sequence start.
the engines are on. Four, three...
the first few moments after liftoff, you're vibrating pretty good.
the clock is running. - Then you really start to move.
clear the tower. - Roger. Clear the tower.
I got a pitch-and-roll program, and this baby is really going.
roll complete.
mark one bravo. - Got you on that.
this thing moves, doesn't it?
baby!
we had just over half a minute of trouble-free launch...
and then all hell busted loose.
what the hell was that? - I just lost a whole bunch of stuff.
we just had a whole bunch of buses drop out.
what have we got here? A/C bus 1 light, all the fuel cells.
okay, Houston, we just lost the platform, gang.
I got three fuel cell lights, an A/C bus light, a fuel cell disconnect...
A/C bus overload 1 and 2, main bus A and B out.
we had some big glitch here.
I got A/C. - You got A/C? Maybe it's the indicator.
what's on the main bus? - 24 volts. That's low.
we've got a short of some kind, but I can't believe that's accurate.
flight, EECOM. - Go, EECOM.
I think it's a fuel cell bus failure. They've been thrown off-line somehow.
that must be why we're getting garbage here.
can they try SCE to aux?
Gerry Griffin had never heard that command before.
most of the people in Mission Control hadn't.
tell them.
Apollo 12, Houston.
try SCE to auxiliary. Over.
FCE to auxiliary? What the hell is that?
I'm not sure even Pete knew what that was, but one person did.
I know what that is.
SCE to aux.
we're getting good telemetry again. Try to reset your fuel cells.
reset fuel cells. - Wait for staging.
hang on.
okay, Houston. GDC is good.
we got a good S-2, gang.
we copy that, Pete. You're looking good.
poor Gerry Griffin.
we were his first mission as flight director...
and he had dealt with more malfunctions than anybody had ever seen.
now we'll straighten out our problems here.
I don't know what happened. I'm not sure we didn't get hit by lightning.
that's exactly what had happened.
before our first stage had finished doing its job...
observers back on the ground later reported that not just one but two bolts of lightning rode our exhaust contrail...
all the way back down to the pad and hit the tower.
that was a hell of a simulation.
Al's got all the buses back on-line.
we'll square up our platform when we get into orbit.
so I had done my part to help out in a crisis.
of course, we owe a lot to that EECOM fella, John Aaron.
but to me, the real hero was Pete Conrad.
he kept his hand on the abort handle the entire time.
but he kept his cool and he never used it.
once I got into Earth's orbit...
I found space flight was everything it was supposed to be.
take a look at this.
those are campfires down there.
that's something, isn't it? - Yes.
beautiful.
down there, people were gathered around man's most primitive discovery.
here the three of us were riding 250, 000 miles into space on a flame.
man, that sky is black.
Yes, it is.
how we looking, Dickie?
you all finished realigning the platform?
I is finished. - Outstanding.
that will give them something to write about tonight.
I bet all our wives fainted.
I'll bet they did when they heard you call about 18 lights.
every time I close my eyes, all I see are those damn lights.
what a way to start. - Terrible way to break in Al Bean.
that's okay. I don't mind.
not everybody was thinking about how Al Bean was enjoying the mission.
in Houston, unbeknownst to us, there was serious concern that the lightning had damaged our pyrotechnic system that would deploy our parachutes.
if we run the TEI checklist...
we test everything they need to get home...
except one big item: deployment of the chutes.
Yeah, but if the barometric switches and timers have failed...
the crew can deploy the chutes manually.
but if the pyros had already been fired
once they're gone, pushing the deploy button won't do anything at all.
is there any way to check the pyros? - Only visual inspection, from outside.
all right, I'll let you know.
they finally decided that if it had...
we'd be just as dead splashing down now as ten days from now.
so they might as well send us to the moon.

Ah, honey, honey
