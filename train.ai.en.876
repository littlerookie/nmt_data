who would you have murdered?
I'm wasting your time, Giovanni.
I'd do anything for you.
I know, you were a good friend to my husband.
come on, you were with him then. Did you love him?
I married him. - But you didn't love him!
you make me sick.
I'd like to see you living like I did, sleeping in a shed! And we ate once a day, that's all.
so, I went with the first one that said "I will bring you to Rome." I married Rome, not him.
well, how was it? With an old man?
don't make me think about it.
come on, sit down.
he used to tell me about you, you know.
what did he tell you? - Everything.
Really? - Once when we were out fishing, he told me how you were built. He bragged about it. I felt like shoving him into the water!
he should have told you that for the last two years I slept alone!
and with whom did you sleep?
your mind's a sewer! When you're raising a daughter, you think about other things!
look... didn't you ever want to?
that's my affair.
what are you doing?
there's no business at this hour.
no one's likely to come in.
you can shut what you want, Giovanni. You don't own me after all.
you like me a little bit, don't you?
but think about your wife... - My wife!
I hope a bomb falls on her, then I can marry you.
no, don't, Giovanni. Please, Giovanni.
Oh, Giovanni, be good!
Ah!
did you hurt yourself? - I could murder you!
where did I hurt you? - Here...
here?
Giovanni!
Giovanni, you must never let my daughter know about this - Or else I'll do something crazy. - Sorry about it already?
you better understand that for me nothing at all happened. We are like we were before.
go on. I'll see you tomorrow.
you think you can treat me like that? Nobody can treat me like that! I'm nobody's property!
thanks a lot for the wine!
you'd better put a new lock on the store right away.
don't worry. I said Gaetano. - That's fine.
if there's is anything new, I'll write you. - I can't! I won't write you.
it takes me an hour to write one word!
a postcard's all right... - Maybe you could come see us some Sunday?
I already thought of that. Ciao!
Ciao.
Rosetta, sit down.
listen, Mamma, don't they sing well?
dirty...
who are you angry at, Signora? - Everyone. -I just hate one person...
what are they singing about? - As always, something sad.
it makes you feel so melancholy!
you know who has the right to be melancholy? We Italians!
my daughter was so excited about living that she didn't sleep last night.
that pig!
what is it? Where are we? - Who knows?
they bombed the rails ahead of us. - Am I supposed to walk to Naples?
it will take for or five hours to repair it.
fuck! - You should thank heaven the trains are running!
I'm not thanking anybody, especially not heaven! - That's your affair!
look, that's Mount Forcella.
Where's Sant'Eufemia? - It's over there. We'll walk, we'll get there sooner.
can we get off the train? - Sure, why not?
we'll have to walk many miles. All right? I like to walk, Mamma.
will you hand me down our stuff? - All right, get off, Signora.
Oh, the sack! Where is the sack?
[German accent] Signora, hold on!
thank you. - Please.
when is this war going to end?
we'll get home for Christmas.
Din-don! Din-don!
bells, Christmas and this all will be over.
and who understands you?
he says it will be over by Christmas. - Damn it! Another six months? It's much too long.
tell that to them! - It all will be over at Christmas.
Din-don! Din-don!
here's how you do it, Rosetta. Look.
watch out!
you have to feel it sitting on the middle of your head, Rosetta. Don't keep your neck so stiff.
easy, like this.
I've lost the skill myself, damn it!
Arrivederci!
Arrivederci! - Arrivederci!
those Germans aren't so bad after all. - No, mamma.
what pretty creatures you are! My sons' eyes are popping out of their heads.
Rosario, hurry up with that. When you're through go to the house and get yourself some food and for Luigino some slices of salami.
what time can we leave tomorrow? - Rosario, when do you think the pretty lady can leave?
whenever she wants. I've got the mule. - I made you a good price.
the room for the night was included. - I didn't have any choice!
what? Why are you complaining? I didn't even ask you for any money in advance.
in this time, who knows? I don't know you, pretty lady. - Don't worry, don't worry.
you know what this is? - Jesus, Joseph and Mary!
I never saw so much money before! Rosario, the lady's a bank!
here the Monkey arrive!
what are you doing here, monkey? - You know what we are doing here.
looking for bread? Some wine? - You are trying to be clever. I am cleverer.
where are your sons?
in Albania! They're fighting in the war. Everyone knows that. They're fighting for the King and Mussolini.
of course. Look in there.
who's using this bicycle, Vincenzo? - My poor old husband doesn't have the strength anymore.
I use it. - Sure, why don't we have a race sometime?
who are they? - People from Rome. They're spending the night with me. They're on their way to Sant'Eufemia.
I gave them a bed. We're Christians...
you know that your sons are deserters. And you know that if we catch them we have to shoot?
I say all deserters should be shot!
here's the wine. Now, let's drink to my sons. Drink, monkey!
give it to me.
what's new in Rome, Signora?
they are dropping bigger bombs every day! - Wait a few more weeks, you'll see...
we have decided to get it over with. - Let's hope so. - Stay here in Fondi, Signora.
here you can eat. In Sant'Eufemia, they won't even sell you flour.
that's where I come from. They know me. - We could put you up at headquarters.
you and the girl could help us out. - Especially in the kitchen.
what are you saying? I'm not servant. Not just servant. To help the militia, it's an honor.
and you? You'd like it?
or would you rather go starve with the goats?
keep that for your sister! - Shut up. I'll tell you when to talk.
you tell who when to talk?
keep your hands to yourself, you miserable pig!
stay away from her, or I'll smash your face! - They're respectable people. They're Fascists!
this woman deserves to be shot. - They're women, maybe you'd better leave them alone.
put that rock down. - Do what he says! - Mamma!
we could force you to come to headquarters. Make her understand.
I will talk her into it, Monkey.
Rosetta. Rosetta.
let's go. It will be light any minute. - I'm sleepy! - Damn it!
those men will come back today. I didn't sleep all night.
Rosetta.
mamma.
Oh, mamma mia! Put this on. Quick, quick, quick!
I shouldn't have showed them all my money, they all look like dirty thieves!
with this, we can go where we want. Please, hurry, sweet angel, hurry!
you've never ridden a mule, have you? - Never, mamma.
when I was young, I loved to ride them. I used to hit them to make them go faster.
Hey, where could we get two mules to take us over to Sant'Eufemia?
I don't know. People doesn't move like before. - I can pay.
my daughter had enough walking. - I'm from the next village, Forcella. I can't help you here.
I bet you anything they're on her way to Rome again. Good bye. - Good bye.
you're not scared, are you? - No, Mama, I'm not scared now.
that idiot tried to kill us!
but why, Mama? - Who knows!
let's go. Come on.
we'd better go round this way... - The poor man... - I know, but we couldn't help him, child.
you are Paride. - And you are Cesira.
you still need a shave. - We're not rich like you people in Rome.
this one made a fortune in Rome! You recognize her?
Luisa!
with a son on the way! - He gave me three already!
sit down, Signora. - Sit down, Cesira. - Thank you.
Signora, this is my niece. - Hello.
we're celebrating a miserable day, my wedding anniversary!
come here, Rosetta, come here!
she's my daughter. This air brings back memories. Like when my mother used to say [She speaks dialect]
do you understand me? - I don't. - It means that a person doesn't stand still.
it means: " Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I'm carrying my heart in a quagmire " .
where is my aunt? - In Naples with her daughter.
Armando? - He's dead.
that's where I was born. It's rented, Signora. I'm waiting for my relatives from Formia.
could you put us up for a month? - I have no room with all this people who are since spring.
I felt at first it was time to escape.
Paride, give them the weaving shed. You can put the loom in your place.
Paride, don't make me beg. Aren't we relatives? - We're all relatives here.
I'm not going back to Rome, nor to Fondi. This morning we almost got ourselves killed. - How?
an airplane. It killed an old man. - We're safe from that here.
we pass the time among friends and we eat. - The English will be here soon.
english or German... who wins, wins. - I'd wish they'd hurry! - Who doesn't?
if the Germans win, I will kill myself.
what have they done to you anyway? - To me personally, nothing.
and then? - So, enough politics. Eat some more. And you play!
what would you like to hear? He used to have an orchestra in Fondi. - Here he plays for nothing.
play "Vivere"!
living... without being jealous...
Signora, you have a store? - And what a store! - What kind? - A grocery.
everything can change world, but not for someone with a grocery store. Filippo De Libero, I have a store in Fondi.
people will always need groceries. - Unless the Russians come. - What do you mean?
the Russians don't believe in business. Life without business is nothing.
you accountants know anything! - What does the Pope think, Signora?
he made a speech yesterday. Everybody cried.
bombs killing women and children! - Don't our bombs kill?
you're the ones who wanted the war! - Me? - Yes, you, too.
if I... - You're wearing your Fascist pin.
so what? - I have one, too. Does that mean I wanted the war? Play something!
that won't change anything! The harm is done. - You talk as if you weren't Italian.
I'm not, if it means stay here and stuffing my face while the rest of the country is dying.
we're pigs. That's what we are! All pigs!
why do you always have to spoil everything, Michele?
he's not a bad boy, Signora. - No, Signora, he's really very nice.
my son should thank God that I'm around to earn money!
he's an idealist. - That's it! - So everybody makes a fool of you.
let's play " Faccetta Nera " [A Fascist song].
maybe I could buy some food for you.
once there was enough of everything here. Money was all you needed.
not now.
you can buy me fifty sacks of flour... twenty sacks of corn meal...
you want some split peas, beans, lentils?
how are the prices? - People around here are still honest.
a jar of lard and some olive oil.
who's got olive oil these days? - I'll get her some, Mama.
don't worry about them, Signora. They come almost every night.
why didn't they wash before dinner? - Ladies don't work on the land.
when I was young, we were worse off than you are!
your land was poor. You sowed the field with wheat and the priests took all the harvest. - You hear, Rosetta?
Papa.
in a little sack there are 60 nuts. Ten persons want an equal share.
do I multiply or divide?
why ask your father? You went to school, you have to teach us.
do you see this piece of bread?
if I want to give one piece to you and one piece to me, what do I do?
stupid! - Leave him alone! The school is closed, it is not his fault.
your uncle will teach you when he comes back. - He can wait. Go to your mother.
he'll never come back. - Where is he? - In Russia.
those Russian women, they only like foreign men. - There are no men in Russia?
peppino will come back!
he wants to be near his little girl. - He left her before she was born.
you want some of these carrots? - We fed these to horses. - War changes things.
Antonio, they're dropping the big lights!
the big lights! Look! There they are! You see the big lights?
how lovely, Mama, makes me feel like praying. - Then pray, my angel, pray.
I beg your pardon, I didn't want to offend you.
it would take more than that. What are they doing with those lights?
they are checking troop movements. - Can they see us? - Very clearly.
isn't there some safe place in the world?
you can't escape. And it is better so.
you see everything so black! What's on your conscience?
sins, like everybody? - There are no sins on my conscience.
well, you might count one... the day before yesterday.
you see? - It was not a sin for which I should die.
and where do the children come into it?
you're getting a real behind like a woman! Signora!
Michele!
Signora, I wanted to... I didn't know, I'm sorry. - Don't worry, she's only a little girl.
I'm inviting you both for a walk. - Dry yourself, dear.
ask the girl to excuse me. - Forget about it, will you? Come back later.
no, mamma!
don't make such a face. - I never want to see him again.
he couldn't have seen you. The sun was in his eyes.
the boy's a bit mad. His father spent a fortune to educate him and all he gets are insults.
the things he said were true. - What do you know about life?
if you talked to me the way he does, I would slap your face.
you should have seen him run!
we must be nice to him.
his father has hams, pasta, everything!
I'm first, I'm first, I won!
you're a real mountain goat! What's that book? - History, I failed it.
what school do you go to? - The convent.
in convents, you never learn how things really are. - Why?
michele says it's wrong to send me to the convent.
there's such a thing as public school, isn't there?
she goes to the best school in Rome. It costs a fortune.
that's right, in Italy, the more money you have the more you go with the priests and the nuns.
Rosetta! - Rosetta! - Ah, you and your smart ideas!
I'm sorry but sometimes I have to say what I think.
do you ever go to church? - Me? - Yes.
a few years ago, I wanted to become a priest.
you wanted to become a priest? - Yes, I did.
why didn't you go ahead and do it? - I realized I didn't have the vocation.
or rather that I did, which is why I didn't become a priest.
Rosetta! - I don't want to come!
come on! - You mustn't say things like that to her.
rosetta's a saint. I'm not even worthy to be her mother.
no, you're something better than you think. - What am I?
a shopkeeper. But in spite of that, you're a good person.
what's wrong with selling things? - You're the same as before. - What?
a peasant. - Thank you for the compliment.
it is one, nowadays. - What do you mean?
the uncivilized people are in the cities today. They are the evil ones.
but peasants could begin again after the war.
what does that mean?
they are the ones who could build something new, but that won't happen while the others control the government.
I'm sure you're wrong, you'll never change the peasants or cheat them.
I made a little money because I am like them,
I never trust anybody. A four-leaf clover!
it will bring you luck, here.
damn it!
damn it, I would give anything to be in Rome right now!
don't you even smoke?
no.
you have a girl? - No.
what's the matter? Didn't you ever have one? - No.
today if a man can't sacrifice a little, he's of no use to himself, his family or country.
right, you can do without a lot of things but not love.
Ehi, little one, come here! - Oh, what do they want?
what do you want? - Glad to see you again.
I was asking were the shortcut to Sella is. - Down there, straight ahead.
it's Filippo's son, the professor. You remember, he's of the good ones.
in that case, he'll be glad to hear what happened. Tell him.
I'd like to see his face when he hears it. Tell him.
we'd better go. - Tell him, tell him!
they have put the Duce in prison. - What are you talking about?
they put Mussolini in jail, like a thief, the one who made the Empire.
and what will happen to Italy now? Twenty years of glory ruined in a day, in an hour!
he was a fool, the Duce, for not getting rid of you traitors at the start.
you don't need reason with traitors. You use this!
put that away, will you? Let him alone, the Germans will get him. Let's go.
if it's really true, I will day happy. Go ahead!
No! - Be quiet, Rose, he will not fire.
the Germans will show you how they handle traitors!
they will make you lick dirt with your tongue! Go on, eat dirt!
let's go, Secretary. And you thank God we are kindhearted. Secretary...
they are going, my daughter, look, you see. Did you believe him Michele? It's like a comedy.
it's true, they're running away. - It's impossible! It can't be true.
but it's true. A new life is beginning.
we can go back to Rome. - Go wherever you like, we're free!
I'm going back, I'm going to tell everybody!
you know something? It's all crazy as hell.
excuse me, Rosetta.
we'll, I'm glad that they've liberated Mussolini, poor man. He has a wife and children, too.
just between us, Mussolini, as a man, I mean... what do you think of him?
as a man? - He would scare me.
how can you make love with that man? I'd freeze up.
all you have to do is switch off the light.
what are you laughing at? - Go and read your book.
I want to know. - We were talking politics.
Signora, tell us what's so funny. - Aren't we playing cards? One moment. Open up, there.
I win! - That's right.
come in.
these two are English. They need assistance.
their submarine brought them to Italy on a mission.
this is no business of yours. - We could hide them for a few days, before they go to South.
but the other people can protest.
they don't protest, they shoot! - Well?
you must explain to them we have a duty toward our families.
there are many spies. If the Germans found out, what a mess!
they'd take us all to Germany, Michele.
Yes, we must think about our children. - You don't have any.
you can't always think about yourself. - You're wearing your Fascist pin.
this way. - Michele.
we could give them some bread. - Isn't she stupid?
she wakes up hungry during the night, yet she wants to give away food. Come on.
they go right after, eh? - I knew you were a decent person.
damn it, anyway. - You should put something on it right away.
I'm used to it from slicing in the shop.
thank you. This wine should be good, because it was given by someone good.
to the English.
to the other English.
to Michele.
a drop for Rosetta, and to me.
to victory. - To a new world.
many of us hope that after the war there'll be a great change.
it will change, but first I'm afraid we'll have to beat the Germans.
it's very good.
viva Giovanni! - Giovanni!
who's Giovanni? - A little more, mamma.
you want to get drunk? My ears are hot already.
there are lots of good things in Italy. - You don't know Italy.
Oh, we know Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo. - They are dead.
you don't know the ones who are alive. Look at those eyes.
show the English your eyes, sweet angel. They're like two stars.
they're pretty. - Beautiful.
instead of landing your armies so far south you should have landed much further up, you would have bombed fewer cities.
and fewer children like this one would have been killed.
headquarters ordered it, it had to have a reason.
headquarters give orders, but they haven't seen these eyes.
why don't you ask him if the war will be finished by spring?
they know less than we do.
well, thank you very much. We don't want to abuse your hospitality.
where are they going to sleep? I've gone this far.
in the mountains, Signora. We're strong enough now.
there are caves up above here in the mountains.
thank you. - That's all right.
thank you, Signora. - Arrivederci.
Arrivederci. - Wait, I'll go see if it's all right.
come on!
put the things away. I'm going out for a breath of air. Feel my forehead.
how warm you are, mamma!
you just keep going straight ahead. - Good bye. Thank you.
when I have a drink, it goes right to my head.
who is Giovanni? - Are you still asking me that? Why do you want to know?
no reason. - He is a friend, one that I can trust.
do you love this Giovanni? - Do you love...?
Why? Can't I love if I want? A widow, she can't be loved?
he has a wife and two kids, anyway.
does it seem right to you that a person has to stick to someone he doesn't love?
it's terrible to go to bed with someone you don't like. Every night, all your life...
come on, Rose, come on.
this horseman is a donkey.
good night, Michele. - Good night. - At least, Michele! - The mice don't respect anything.
they have gnawed off even the Bible. - Put yourself in the middle.
we are not at church, you wanted to read us a story.
Michele, read whatever you want.
here you have beautiful stories, even better than in the novels.
I read of when Jesus walks on the sea. Better, the Lazarus' resurrection.
mama, come here, don't stand up.
no, I have to prepare the grass for dinner.
who's that? - He's the son of refugees just arrived. His mother is ill.
now we have become like goats, eating grass.
please, read. - Who has the flour, does not sell it. - Please, read.
the farmers buried it.
impossible to find the salt.
we ought to help each other. - We are all Italians. - Please read, Michele.
"a man named Lazarus - at Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister were living..." - Why have not you call me before?!
Mary is that person who anointed the Lord's feet with perfume and wiped them with her hair.
it was her brother Lazarus that was ill. - Amen.
so the sisters sent him this message: "Please, Master, you dear friend is ill."
Jesus said: "This illness will not result in death."
no, it is to promote the glory of God. Through it, the Son of God is to be glorified.
now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus...
can you give me some bread? - Be quiet.
he tarried, it is true, for two days in the place where he was.
Achille! Did you buy some oil? - No, they it was too expensive.
stupid, it will become even more expensive. You ought to buy!
a postcard for Serafino and one mail for Cesira.
did you listened at radio? - They failed to land because of a woman.
but now they'll carry out the offensive. - This time it's true.
Signora Cesira, here we are! - The Battista's son came back.
we're going to talk later. - See you...
Michele, let's go on.
he remained for two days in the place where he was. Then after this he said to his disciples:
"let us go back to Judea."
the disciples said to him: "Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?"
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in a day?"
if one walks during the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world. But if one walks at night...
they tried to steal at home, but Giovanni cheated them!
he's better than a brother!
they could to ruin me. The Rosetta's dowry was in the wardrobe.
you are all dead, deader than Lazarus.
with your flour, with your thieves' scare, your wealth walled up not even Jesus Christ could resuscitate you!
Michele!
what's wrong? - Nothing
mama, was listening to him!
Michele's right.
please stop! What's wrong?
nothing. - You called us dead!
we'll die by starvation for sure! - Me too I'm dead. - You, so young?
you have always to say what is in your heart, right or wrong...
I have not the nerve to talk aloud. - You're even too much sincere.
I am not sincere with you. - With me?
sure, with you.
Shoo! Even the goats! I'll have to clean up everything here.
the gate is broken since I went away.
let's go, it's raining.
I love you, Cesira.
in such a trouble, do you mind to that? - I have to tell you.
you could too give me a smack in the face, but it's true.
these stupids are here to see the scene!
don't you mind to such a things? - Me?
you mind, you mind. You have someone in your heart.
only my daughter.
I've decided to go back home, Rosetta. - Se vuoi, mamma.
they won't bomb Rome anymore. They'll start bombing here. - True, mamma.
how skinny you got. You need more to eat. We have plenty to eat, in Rome.
how cold she is! Come here, Rosetta.
mama, why doesn't he come anymore, Michele? - I don't know.
he loves you, Michele. - Go on.
I can see why, you're so beautiful.
he's 25 years old! Never go with a boy younger than yourself.
but he's the nicest man in Sant'Eufemia. - Being a nice man these days isn't much help.
damn draft!
you know what I think Michele is? A subversive. - What's that?
someone with a good heart who doesn't like work.
we'd better give him back his book. - But he gave it to me. - He'd make a good husband.
he has no vices. If you were a few years older, I'd let you marry him.
what are you saying, mamma! - You'll have to think about such things someday, no?
listen to her laugh!
we're crossing the fishing port.
starboard is a tuna boat with its heap of nets in the back and the skiff on the poop deck.
the skiff holds one end of the net as the boat circles a tuna shoal.
most tuna boats are at sea now.
they make 3-month excursions off the coasts of Libya, Malta, Cyprus,
turkey and the Balearic Islands.
there, on the right, those are trawlers. Those boats over there.
on either side of the seine are grids to hold the nets open horizontally when it's dredging behind the boat.
they go out on day trips, Monday through Friday, from 2 in the morning to mid-afternoon, until the boss says they have enough.
that's the fish crier's compartment.
it got its name because there once was a man yelling what fish they had, and the price.
now that's all over. Everything's on computer.
the SECRET OF THE GRAIN
that's the scrap area.
that's where scrapiron is stored, before being shipped to Turkey.
there used to be ovens in France. We lost the matches.
unless it's a manpower problem.
Marie, take over a minute!
God damn!
over there, concrete blocks are piled, forming a breakwater.
this is crazy, Madeleine. Stop!
what's crazy? This?
I'm working.
this is no time.
it's exciting!
hurt me.
it's not the time.
if you look behind you, on the left you can see boats pulled ashore for repair.
this is called the harbor careening area.
that's where repairs are made to the boat's underside, meaning every part which is immersed.
Rudders, paint, propellers, etc.
what is it?
so a schedule is toilet paper?
what schedule?
I made one up. You werert on it this morning.
you talk schedules and deadlines. How can I finish?
you don't finish the job!
this project is stagnating.
we've been at it 3 days!
Exactly! It's been 3 days! - Talk about schedules.
3 days is too much. I can't wait.
that's the problem. This project's going nowhere.
if you can't move these jobs, what do I tell the others?
jose, quit it. I'm talking to Slimane.
it's not your business. Keep out of it.
everyone stops. When does the job get done?
you play me for a fool!
what's the idea? What's up with this job?
it should be done!
you read the schedules now.
don't ask questions and things will be simple.
you're making my life difficult.
I'll read that schedule...
I had to cut your hours.
it's early. Things are still slow.
I don't get it.
look on the bright side.
you'll have time with your grandkids.
to go fishing.
who asked you?
I got my orders.
we're over quota for man hours.
listen, we're trying to stave off the worst.
anybody who's not happy...
don't give me that stare.
I said don't!
you want me out, is that it?
I only said it's slow now.
can't pay you to loaf.
I work.
I know.
I do my job. - I know.
I've worked 35 years.
35 years.
in salt.
between the sea and the yard.
so what?
you're not profitable anymore.
you're tired and you're tiresome. That's the truth.
you had 2 days to finish that boat.
two days is two days. Not 21/2, not 3.
know what you're costing me?
there's work to be done on that boat.
I don't know.
I'm not a businessman anyway.
you don't know what work that boat needed. You don't.
I'm sorry for you, Slimane.
I don't get you.
ren made you a good offer. You said no.
I've been on the yard since '69.
ren says I got 16 years in.
not even half of the truth.
not our fault you were off the books.
we took over in '90.
what happened before...
I don't get it. - You don't?
I don't. Tell me.
you know, but you won't say it. How long have I been on the yard?
you have to choose.
you want to go on working, you accept flexible hours.
otherwise... - What?
you know our conditions. How many times do I have to tell you?
all right, I got it.
you got it.
I hope you got it.
how are you?
guess what happened to us?
what?
got stopped in the no fishing zone. Really hurt us.
the fat guy who used to be a crier.
right, Henri? - He hates us.
bastard.
he had a field day.
smiling, from ear to ear.
I said, "Come on, be reasonable. I got overhead."
2, 000 euros fine and banned for a week.
stubborn ass.
we all got a job. We fish. He gives out fines.
you better be careful. There's no more work.
now I've got work trouble.
I told you, they want us out.
I told you to get out.
either get out, or they'll throw you out.
anyway, till you get fed up...
Hey, that's how life is.
life is not all rosy.
what did Michel say last night?
he needs help to break up that old boat, a Source.
lots of work. - An old freighter.
3 or 4 guys, a week's work.
Yeah, I'd say two weeks.
honest boss, he'll pay you.
you got no worries.
I worked for him. He's straight up.
give him some fish.
I'll just sort it and I will.
aziz, pass me the crate.
pass me the fish, please.
Jeremy, sort a while so I can serve Slimane.
not a lot.
that OK?
just 2 or 3 mullet and that's fine.
I'll clean them.
give him more.
I give him the crate?
I'm not kidding.
that's all I needed.
I got to pay the diesel bill.
out of the bathroom!
turn that shower off!
I just got in!
you don't pay the phone, the water, the electric!
end of the month, nobody helps me.
shoes!
smells like fish.
no, it doesn't. It's fresh. It smells like the sea.
the sea...
then I clean it and I smell like the sea.
it's cleaned, don't worry.
clean or not, it won't pay the bills.
you never eat fish here?
we do. You think we're cats?
all day long, fish and more fish.
what good is bringing me fish?
bring caviar while you're at it.
you missed two alimony payments!
all selfish! Everyone around me is selfish!
what am I supposed to do?
I am not happy!
don't look at me like that.
you know what you did. I said, "Pee?" You said, "No."
ask for the potty.
bad girl. Sit on the potty. Go!
sit down!
sit, or I'll get mad.
Hi, Dad.
she didn't ask for the potty. So here we go again.
she's little. - No! She knows what she did.
Hi, honey.
got a kiss for Grandpa?
come. - She stays on the pot!
leave her alone. What's done is done.
don't you move!
let her be.
it's nothing.
don't yell.
she gets on my nerves.
I keep telling her.
want to stay in diapers forever?
dad!
let her be.
let me wash the dirty girl. I didn't wash her!
let her be.
bad girl.
lucky she didn't get spanked today.
pretty girl.
she's not pretty, she's bad. A very bad girl.
she knows she's off the hook.
look!
you're disgusting.
little piggy.
you lucked out. You'll see next time.
Hi, Grandpa! - Hi, hon.
give Grandpa a kiss.
finish eating.
sit down here.
did you eat?
this isn't over!
I'm not too hungry.
no more peeing in diapers!
a little coffee.
answer me. It's over. Now it's the potty.
see that? When she's in your arms... And she knows it!
you lucked out. We'll see later.
mom, leave my sister alone.
she still pees in diapers, at her age!
you were out of diapers.
wait, Dad. Eat first. Why the coffee?
I'm not hungry.
you ate before?
what did the cowboy want?
come on, eat. You keep talking and you're not done.
what did he want?
they made schedules. I'm on half-time.
you asked for it?
tell them no.
anyway, they're reviewing personnel. They want no Frenchmen.
the old guys are out.
no, the French.
that way, no hassles.
sugar? Dad, the doctor...
I had sugar.
dad, you put sugar in it.
he didn't, I did.
why'd you put sugar out?
I've worked there since Jose was born.
did they give me a contract?
they could have. They don't want Frenchmen.
it has been a while. - What can I do?
you got to act. It's like you're afraid.
afraid of what? - Exactly!
what should I say?
you say nothing. You stay... - What?
you could keep this up 10 years.
till your hair turns white.
then they'll fire you. Great.
at the cannery...
Safia, enough! Want to go potty again?
want to go potty?
it's all right.
no, you stay here or you go potty.
so, at the cannery, we get bonuses. They tried to eliminate them.
the guy they sent, the VP, said they'd lost American markets.
just like that, one day they say, you lose this cause we lost that.
so just like that, we organized. Everyone in the cafeteria.
we made signs. We went on strike, stopped working.
when they saw the line stopped, they needed us, they all came out of the woodwork.
they watched how they spoke to us.
we were all there, ready to go the limit.
we said if we have to set a fire, we'll set a fire.
but our bonuses don't go. Don't even try it.
considering what we get paid...
so when they came...
we'd elected... what's her name?
your co-worker's wife. - Lionel?
his wife. I don't know her very well. Melanie?
Melanie was our spokesperson. She went to them and said, no one goes back to work until we get our bonuses.
I swear, quick as lightning, we got our bonuses. They got scared.
they can't just do anything. - Yes, they can.
ask your father. - No way.
they're tired of benefits and withholding.
they outsource. Somewhere guys get 10 bucks a week.
anybody in there? - Yes!
they take advantage of people who are making a pittance.
they're the best. They do that very well.
and they keep lining their pockets.
so every year, you hear the same line.
on TV, that's all you hear.
you watch too much TV. - People are too passive.
no, it comes down from above.
it's shameful.
that's how it is. Half as many boats in 10 years.
then one day, no more boats.
just a marina. No more fishing boats.
no more yard. Only tourists.
for them: Less hassle, more money.
they take advantage of people.
I brought some fish.
again?
you just brought us some.
that's a lot.
it's good for the kids.
not even a thank you.
Thanks. But I get some at the cannery.
not the same. This is fresh, for the kids.
that's true, you're right.
don't look at me like that, you little piggy!
she'll remember this day.
I'm running late. Dad, can you drop me off?
we'll go together. - Fine.
don't want a bite first?
no. Tonight I...
give Grandpa a hug.
hug Grandpa and I won't be mad anymore.
I'll hug him, too.
good thing I have you, Dad.
don't worry. It'll work out.
they can't change your life.
you too, give mom a hug. Oh, you're a sweetheart.
and Grandpa.
my kids adore you!
jose, come here.
show them Grandpa's nice fish.
he thinks of us.
careful, don't fall.
can I touch? - Are your hands clean?
I'm going.
nice, right?
don't touch too much.
look at the fish. Show her the fish.
in water, he moves this.
look at that fish.
see that?
it's Nemo.
they got big teeth.
how are you?
I brought fish.
sure you're OK?
Hi, Slimane. - Hello, Rym.
you OK?
some fish. - Let me see.
havert had any in a long time.
mullet. The yellow kind!
that is super cool. Thanks.
make it tonight? - No problem.
how are you?
mom see this?
what did she say?
coming back down?
come, let's go to sleep.
I don't get it.
it doesn't matter.
I didn't really want to either.
come and sleep.
what are you doing?
I'm going back to my room.
what's the matter?
what's going on?
not in your room.
I don't feel right.
how long do we go on this way?
the guests...
that's your place. Then I come here...
it's just that the bed is bigger.
you know, I'm just a guest.
stop.
you're independent.
you're young.
you like life, you like freedom.
I've done nothing, left nothing to you and Rym, to my children.
why are you saying this?
it's not moist enough.
I put it in already. I can't take it out now.
like this?
a little less.
another potato peeler headed for the trash.
can't go any faster?
mom, she's not great at dishes.
I'll get it. - Go.
don't forget, shoes off.
what took so long?
scared you?
shoes! - I took them off.
Hi, honey.
wow, lots of work.
how are you?
easy on the harissa. - We know.
and the kids?
on the balcony. Go ahead.
Thanks. Nice change from fish.
Hi, honey.
Hey, sweetie.
what are you drinking? - I'll have...
bring a glass and a beer.
give him the big plate.
that's the plate.
she's pretty! - Pretty, right?
Hi, Henri. - Hi, Lilia.
your daughter's pretty. - Thanks.
how old is she now?
almost two.
time sure does fly.
tell Auntie how old you are. Show her.
two. Just two fingers.
five?
she's so smart.
incredible.
and still in diapers?
I can't get rid of them.
and I work at it every day.
try the potty? - Sure. I put her on it.
she won't go on the potty.
just to sit her down on it, she has a fit.
soon as I take her off, then she goes.
cause she yells at her.
I don't yell.
it's not her fault. It's the diaper companies.
the new diapers absorb a whole quart.
kids get used to it. They don't get it.
even wet, they feel dry.
see what I mean?
they're shock absorbers.
they fall, get right back up.
it's true.
that's why they do it.
take one out, throw it away. Take another...
see the price at the supermarket?
she uses 5 a day.
how long does one pack last?
not even a week!
how much is it? - 15 euros.
Olfa, the calculator!
fifteen is a lot.
that's not even a week!
thirty to a pack...
here comes the details.
this will take all afternoon.
the diaper budget!
six times three...
math and me...
wait.
six a day. A pack is five days.
that makes 6 packs a month.
600 F times twelve.
imagine in 2 years.
7, 200 F a year!
look at the face he's making!
OK, everybody! Let's go.
hurry up. Julia, go get dressed. Please.
everyone's downstairs. They made couscous.
what the hell is this? Julia!
Serguei, tell your sister or I'll get crazy.
all right.
stop talking in Russian.
look in my eyes, go get dressed.
I said no! That's French! I'm not coming!
why are you yelling? - You don't listen!
come back to earth.
go down to your mother's! Go eat!
you wait for your brother to pull this shit?
Hi, Serguei.
what's going on? - They're manic.
I just got here. It's crazy.
what set it off?
I don't know. I got here, Julia was upset.
I think Majid got in about six or seven in the morning.
Julia found stuff in his jacket.
condoms or girls' phone numbers. I don't know.
you know your brother.
let's go get dad.
come on, get up!
I've had enough!
leave me alone!
what the hell is this?
get out before I go crazy!
get out! Your mama's calling!
stop yelling.
look at her!
and I'm crazy!
you're crazy, yes!
majid, there's a baby in the house.
a little respect.
you just wait! - Who do you think I am?
get out! You're a pain in the ass! Majid!
garbage!
what? What's going on?
when your sister's here! Big man!
go downstairs or I swear I'm going to lose it.
mom's waiting.
you'll see tonight!
what will I see?
shut the fuck up!
he went downstairs. It's over.
put this off a day.
it's hard. Sorry.
come downstairs, Julia.
go change. Do it for me.
the marital fights are later. This is not the time.
lilia wants to see you. She asked for Hakim.
everyone's there. It's good vibes, good times.
Yeah, good times. - Easy.
everyone's waiting for you. We're all happy. Come downstairs.
don't worry, it'll be all right.
please. Get up and change.
we'll see about this later.
come on, Julia. Please.
OK, Karima. But only for you.
fine, no problem.
cause it's hard.
I'll get dressed. - Go ahead.
Serguei, come have dinner.
I'll come down with her. I'll just change the baby.
OK, see you there.
hakim, let's go. Let's go eat Grandma's couscous.
let's go.
all right, what is this crap?
it's nothing.
we all know about your bullshit.
what bullshit? I went out for a drink.
and all those girls? - What girls?
what is this shit? We all fucking know!
I'm talking here. - You heard rumors?
you're too stupid to be discreet.
get out. I didn't do anything. I got in late one night.
late one night?
like I don't know where you hang out?
get out. - Like I don't know?
you got a kid. You're married. You forget?
now stop acting like a kid.
and get it straight that you got a family.
hello Mrs. Jilali. - Hi, kids.
been to the market? Not too crowded?
not too bad.
and your health?
how's your mom? Your dad?
just fine.
say hello to them for me? - I will.
bye now. Take care.
you piss me off!
want some onions?
mom, one more place. Serguei's coming.
honey, give me the kids' plates.
serve the kids first.
you're looking peaked!
give me your plate. You can bone the fish.
everybody got some?
did everyone get sauce?
and vegetables?
enjoy your meal, everybody.
it's prepared with love.
love. The couscous of love.
it's absolutely delicious.
the vegetables are just right.
Souad, you're talented for couscous.
it's about time.
sorry we're late. Sorry, Souad.
you go through midtown? We've been waiting.
Hey, handsome. He's a little warm.
Yeah, his bottom's all red. I can't settle him down.
I went through hell when Thomas was a baby.
want your mommy?
azza honey, got everything?
are they eating?
no worries.
Safia, listen to your auntie.
I thought it was Slimane.
Hi, everyone!
the most beautiful!
you OK?
it's a family day today.
where is he?
Henri, the girls!
my fault. I had car trouble. I needed his help.
like I don't?
I completely forgot.
we'll talk later.
where do I sit?
I'll get you a plate.
when you got nice cold ones, you forget your woman.
and you turned your cell off. Voice mail!
now you're dead.
Souad, serve her. She's starving.
just a little. I'm on a diet.
don't start with me today. - I didn't say a word.
your couscous is great, Mom. - Got that right.
no peppers? - I can't eat without that.
go get them. They're in the pan.
orange juice.
here, Majid.
Majid's not talking.
something wrong?
Yeah, today he's pretty silent.
all that partying last night.
see? He eats at Grandma's.
here's Grandma's couscous.
all smiles, so happy.
see that?
better than fish sticks.
quit arguing. Have some. Enough for everyone!
I don't want any. I'll leave my share.
Riadh special! - Very nice!
Olfa, some bread!
I love it. - How do you do it?
I made the peppers and helped with the couscous.
when she does something, she says so. It's so rare!
she has helped her mom all day long.
may I have some more grain?
with pleasure.
werert you on a diet?
give her a break. Women and diets!
she said so. Right away, "I'm on a diet."
now she's changing.
good. I'm getting fat, but it's good.
no. When you start to eat, you say Besmellah.
not a "G," a "B."
there. You got it.
know any other Arabic words?
one of my first!
that's all you taught him, Lilia? - A few others.
we don't speak Arabic at home.
with your wife, you must have learned some things.
curse words!
you learned a few words.
you know, when...
what? - When we're alone.
naturally.
when we make love.
get out of here.
don't believe him.
she often says...
often! - It's not true.
don't believe it. - He's shameless.
he's going wild.
but you do teach the kids?
not... - Yes.
more Thomas. - The boys understand.
a little bit.
when does your mom speak Arabic?
when she's mad.
then you understand, when she's mad?
what does she say? Remember?
she says lots of things.
only when she's mad?
that true, Lilia?
they understand my mother.
they're used to it. - My aunts.
they're exposed to it.
easier for them than for me. When your mother was visiting...
they spoke Arabic all the time. I couldn't stand it.
I kept saying, "What?" Remember?
I didn't understand.
I had to constantly translate. She made an effort.
she did, yes.
it's handy for secrets with my friends.
so he doesn't understand.
right. And I don't.
they're all there...
they're having tea.
it's true, sometimes I feel uneasy.
it's like I get the feeling they're talking about me, like...
they're making fun of me.
you never made the effort to learn. I keep offering.
true. - You never did.
I don't have the time. - I taught you a few words.
what did you teach him?
"I love you," and "darling."
so?
don't remember?
close.
that it?
listen to her say it.
he'll never get it right.
I'll get it.
Yeah, you can.
maybe in 5 or 10 years...
can I have a plate for the kids? - Of course.
one for the neighbor. I'll bring it.
already did it.
I saw her before. She says hi, asked for Dad.
there's a plate for your father. Bring it later, boys.
I'll go with Riadh.
you two are going?
least he's won'th it. Not like some.
we miss him around here.
what do you want? That's life.
love, love!
love, huh?
that's not love.
sure it is, Mom. It's a gesture of love.
then what is it?
love... - It is love.
that's Ichra.
it's stronger than love.
it's habit. It's all in there. Love, friendship, everything.
own your feelings. You love him, that's all.
Souad, if I may, from that plate, I know there's still love.
there's a difference between Dad's and the neighbor's.
it was made with love. - You can tell.
I make the couscous with love.
love...
takes everyday maintenance.
it's getting along.
but... you have to earn it.
dad's a good man. He deserves better.
isn't he? He worked 35 years for his family.
what else you want? - It's not a mzia if it's a duty.
but he did his duty. We never wanted for anything when we were little. He was always there.
now I can get by on my own, but...
he was around!
listen, all of you. Either you quit messing around or I get the laundry list out!
every Sunday, laundry list.
every Sunday, she tells the same story.
enough.
don't fight now. - We're not.
I love Dad and Mom.
majid, get those peppers away from her.
a husband like that, I would never let him go.
take him!
look, Mom's jealous.
you're jealous. You still love him!
how's the couscous?
mom did good.
we sure loved it.
I had two plates full.
Yeah, it was good.
they're a fucking drag.
I don't know how you live in this dump.
how can you stay here?
go back to the old country.
Majid's right, Dad.
you got nothing here. It's all there.
sunshine, friends. - And the house.
Yeah, Mom said she'd leave you the house.
go whenever you want.
you just leave it for her when she comes.
don't need it.
you'll feel good there now. It'll be great.
you'll be super healthy, I know it.
you live in a dump.
even Karima said you'd be better off there.
she'll bring the kids on vacation.
I'll bring Hakim.
we'll stay together.
put in some time.
I'll think it over.
Yeah, think.
Hey, Rym. - Leave me some?
I did. Come in.
I won't interrupt. - Come in.
no, I'm OK. - Come in.
not long.
how are you?
how you doing?
sit down.
I could smell it downstairs.
how are you, Majid?
good.
I saw your son, with your wife.
he's bigger. - Yeah.
how old is he?
10 months. - Already? Time flies.
he's beautiful. - Thanks.
your wife looked a little tired. - A little.
she lost weight. - Yeah, she did.
worries, huh?
delicious.
havert had couscous like this in a while.
sorry. When there's couscous the world disappears for me!
eat the fish.
here, some peppers.
they're good.
really nice.
super good.
have some squash. - Give me.
not talking?
lost your tongues?
dad.
think about what I said.
nothing's keeping you here.
you should go back home.
you could start a business, with the severance pay.
severance talk going around town already?
I swear I didn't say anything.
people talk.
people love to talk.
they say the yard's over.
that you got severance, like severance payments?
good?
great. Never had one so good.
tell your mother.
no problem.
I could eat this every day.
I've done that.
I could explode. I'll sleep good.
your sons are really hard.
especially Majid.
Why?
they want you to go back home. What does that mean?
they want to get rid of you?
are they messing with you?
like you need them to tell you what to do.
like it's for your own good. - I let them talk.
Yeah, you do. I noticed you let them talk.
I swear! No respect.
you're home. This is your room.
and we're your family. You're like my father, I mean it.
what's that? "Nothing's keeping you here."
the gall. Right in front of me.
people have no respect. Who does he think he is?
don't pay him any mind.
I can't accept that.
no way. What's France, a whore house? Let him go back. Good riddance.
he thinks France is a whore house.
I'd have told him, but out of respect for you and the couscous...
only because he's your son.
he really got on my nerves. Really!
you like Riadh?
he's OK.
gets on my nerves!
don't mind what he says.
why'd you say you'd think it over?
because I don't mind what he says.
he thinks that means yes.
let him talk.
say nothing, let him talk. You'll see what happens.
he gets confident, talks about it again.
don't let him, OK?
make some more coffee.
Yeah, but just by letting him...
you have to talk.
you just sit there.
bastard.
he gets me crazy.
why doesn't he sing? - I don't know.
sing.
remember how he used to sing?
he almost never does now. I don't know.
what's wrong with him?
look, he's eating couscous.
I didn't leave you much.
people!
see how children are?
acting big.
that's not right.
such a traitor.
funny seeing him here. Most Sundays he's with his whores.
I know stuff about him I don't tell you.
lots of talk I heard.
he should go hide back home.
don't be mad, it's nothing.
he's lost it.
your sors got a problem.
it's nothing. Forget all that.
says my hotel is a dump.
like his face isn't?
don't tell your mother.
if Mom heard that...
we'd be in deep shit.
worked all her life to buy this.
she's a woman. Not a man.
all he knows how to do is talk.
least we got a hotel.
you making the coffee?
there's the boat, my child.
want to board?
lots of work.
come in.
Hello, Mr. Beji, Miss...
please sit down.
well?
what brings you here?
I'm here to ask for a loan.
my father wants to open a restaurant on a boat he's just acquired.
we prepared a dossier to present our project.
Congratulations.
let's have a look.
there are some mistakes.
I see that.
is that all?
we only just started working.
you realize it's a little light.
especially in view of the sum you request.
45, 000 euros, that's a nice chunk.
we need it for the renovation.
that sum will only cover the renovation costs?
no. It also covers equipment, kitchen, decor, tables, chairs. All that.
how about operating costs? How will you cover that?
have you thought about start-up funds?
no, but we can work it out. It's no problem.
my stepfather worked on the yard.
all his co-workers will pitch in.
and when it comes to personnel, we'll have free labor.
it's all family. So we'll save a lot of money, right?
Yes, but you must understand, I can't put that on paper.
I have to satisfy my superiors. If I go in saying, Mr. Beji and all his friends and family will do it all,
it won't fly.
I need a projected budget, with much more detail, with estimates from established and serious professionals.
how did you come to these figures anyway?
did you do any market studies?
no, we just got the application from the Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Beji, if I recall correctly, you're now unemployed.
you were laid off?
Yes, but I got my severance pay.
and I get unemployment.
right.
you want to change careers. Very commendable.
but let me ask you a few questions.
your chosen business, restaurants, is a very difficult one right now.
first of all, where would it be located?
actually, we'd like it to be if possible.
have you asked for an authorization?
it's pending.
sure there's a spot open?
but the tuna boat guys told me there's a spot open.
they said so.
perhaps, but you need the permission of local authorities.
there are many restaurants already.
Yes, but none that makes fish couscous.
that's true.
so I want to try my luck.
it is an original idea.
is that the only specialty?
for now, fish couscous is the house exclusive.
but, of course, we'll make up a full menu, with various combinations.
and we'll rent it out for parties, baptisms, circumcisions, weddings.
and we had another idea.
during Ramadan, we'll turn it into a warm meeting place for our community to gather share ideas, our culture, and to eat. Because...
they don't have much in this city. We've got ideas.
of course, even people outside our community are welcome.
I see. How old are you, Mr. Beji?
sixty-one.
look, this all seems a little fresh.
though your project doesn't seem uninteresting at all!
it just needs fleshing out.
so I suggest you come back to me with a complete work-up.
with a detailed projected budget, with professional estimates, including operating expenses, personnel you wish to hire, a target number for meals served, and how many meals per day will put you in the black.
and have a CPA sign off on it.
and of course the additional paperwork we spoke about.
the customs license, the docking authorization, and the collateral you can put up.
the collateral is the boat. That's all.
that's it.
I'm afraid that won't be enough.
it's in bad shape.
I saw the photo. How much is it won'th?
10, 000 euros.
seriously. That's not enough.
ten thousand.
compared to the sum you want to borrow, that's nothing.
it'll be won'th much more, once we renovate.
perhaps, Miss.
maybe I lack imagination to speculate on such a project but I can guarantee you, with this plan, 5, 000 is the most you can hope for.
maybe!
those folders are great. We can print them.
what is it? - Hello.
tell them OK. Forget the rest.
are you Mr. Dorner? - Yes.
we have an appointment.
an appointment? With me?
Yes, they do.
OK, what about?
for an authorization.
an authorization? For what?
I have... a boat.
let me explain. We want to open a restaurant on a boat.
turn a boat into a restaurant.
so we came to see you to obtain the authorization.
I heard about that. That the file? - Yes, here.
and this boat-restaurant, where is it now?
at the G-0 dock.
the Source.
got some work to do.
where do you want to put it?
that's not easy.
I don't know if there's room.
did you inquire?
Yes. The tuna boat guys said there was a spot.
Yes, there's a spot open.
might be one for a tuna boat.
but a restaurant?
a couscous place at that.
not easy.
might be a spot, but you have to ask the port authority.
the tuna boatmen don't decide. We'll verify that.
and the customs license?
we see them next week.
I need that license. - We'll bring it.
and you're getting a bank loan? Did you get it yet, or not?
the bank is waiting for the city to grant authorization.
they want the city's opinion?
right.
the city wants financing before granting authorization.
look, we at the city will study the feasibility, to see if it's viable.
if it is, we'll transfer it over to the police authority.
but right now I can't tell you anything more.
check back with my secretary.
get what's missing to her.
sorry I didn't have more time, but I'm running late today.
have a nice day. - See you soon.
make sure they get everything I requested.
from the bank. They'll be back.
a letter stating they've applied.
without the loan, where are they going with this?
what's keeping you?
I'm done.
I don't have much time for lunch.
I've got yoga today.
ever run a restaurant? - No, ma'am.
and your kitchens are up to safety standards?
french law is very strict about that.
we're renovating.
renovating or not, I'm warning you:
to be licensed, and to keep that license, you need the Health Dept. Certificate.
that's how it works in France.
you're going into a business with very strict rules on hygiene.
in France anyway.
anything concerning a new restaurant opening, the kitchens must be up to code.
we... I can give you the license in one day.
I can deliver it to you right now.
but if you have an inspection, and if the inspector judges that your kitchers not up to code, you can get permanently shut down. And my hands will be tied.
you understand what I'm saying?
so, you have to go back to the bank and explain what I just told you, that you came to see us, and since you're putting up the boat,
I don't see why they wouldn't finance your plan.
especially since you have property.
in any case, as for us, it's French law and there are no exceptions.
that's it. Do you understand?
Hey, Riadh.
Hey, how are you?
good.
making progress. - Little at a time.
not too rough? - It's all right.
come and eat.
Yeah, thanks.
how are you, Slimane?
kitchers looking mean. Real nice.
you like the blue?
gorgeous.
really nice.
not too tired? - I'm all right.
the paint works wonders.
looks great.
come sit down and eat, two minutes.
Oh, I saw Rabah, the grocer.
he said if you want to shop on his card, it's tomorrow.
Riadh! - I told him.
call him.
no, let it go. I called him.
Riadh! - Coming!
come and eat.
I bet you didn't eat at all.
that's no good. Cigarette, coffee...
you work hard. You have to eat.
you like it? - Gorgeous. Totally.
Really?
it's clean now.
there's a little tidying up to do.
but that'll go quick.
I'll sleep here tonight.
mom won't like that.
she gave me lip. - I know.
you don't care. You're above that. Don't mess everything up, OK?
tell her.
I got a head full of worries. - I know.
I'm not sure I can get the authorization, the loan and all.
I keep explaining.
Yeah, I know.
your mother's got to understand.
she does. She's pretending.
look, you got all this work to do.
don't get caught up in all this stuff. Who cares?
so you'll come home after, OK?
we'll see. - Stop.
do it for me. Who cares about her? We don't care.
what good is it? I get back, she looks at me crooked.
we'll look crooked right back at her.
come on.
please come home tonight.
we'll see. - Please.
that sandwich any good?
Oh yeah, it's good.
you made it?
then it's good.
Thanks.
you OK, Dad?
fine.
finished up there? - Yeah, almost.
then you come down. We'll finish the kitchen tonight.
Yeah, it'll be quick.
don't forget to close everything up.
if no one's watching, turn the TV off!
what's with her?
she's pitching another fit.
a fit?
pitching a fit? You're not in her shoes.
she's got reasons.
you know, since this restaurant thing...
what restaurant?
you know Slimane's opening a restaurant on a boat?
that's why she's like that.
he bought a boat?
what do you mean, bought?
he picked up a wreck ready to be junked.
that boat, still in the same place.
falling apart. - Right.
at the end of the dock?
that's the one. That's right.
make a restaurant out of that boat? What's he got, a screw loose?
seriously.
a couscous place, he said.
couscous on a boat?
it's an old idea of his.
he's right. Life is tough.
it's a good idea.
hang on, hang on.
fixing up that boat takes dough. That's not easy.
you need a lot. It's not free.
he got something on his layoff.
not much.
his age, he wants to take a shot at a restaurant?
hostesses, kitchens, hours...
not easy.
it's complicated.
Yeah, but he does have his two kids.
those two!
they're lazy! - We know them.
counting on them...
of course he's counting on them.
and what's more, his ex-wife is doing the cooking.
I get it now. Souad!
that's why Latifa is...
now you see?
I've seen them.
they had an all-out.
she broke the place up. All over the place.
he was going to leave. The girl stopped him.
Yeah, for her it's a humiliation. He betrayed her.
he humiliated her.
right.
just imagine.
because when he lost his job, she thought, maybe with the severance he gets, he could help her fix up the hotel and all.
no. Now she sees him, he wants to open a restaurant on a boat, put his kids to work.
it's a revolution.
wait.
with his ex-wife's couscous!
imagine the situation.
she's like a crazy person.
she's like crazy.
but you got to understand him.
you know Slimane and his pride.
he doesn't want to be a kept man, or look like a pimp.
see what I mean?
this situation is very serious.
it's no good for one, no good for the other.
it's a really weird situation.
it's not easy.
just between us...
you know one time I tasted Latifa's couscous.
it was inedible. Terrible.
we ate it anyway, out of friendship.
but I mean it was awful.
totally tasteless.
but Latifa's nice. I like her.
she's nice but she can't make couscous.
she's very nice.
did his wife say yes?
she's no picnic either.
Yeah, but how he put it to her.
for the good of the kids...
Yeah, because he's got no money, no authorization.
in the bargain!
tough. Starting with nothing.
that's tough.
he's putting together like a party, to raise money. He invited some big shots.
like a test.
to show he can do it. See?
whers his party going to be?
that I don't know. The girl must know.
I'll ask.
come here a second. - Coming.
what is it?
tell me, have you seen Slimane around?
you know when his restaurant party is going to be?
you murderers! It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!
H A T E
this film is dedicated to friends and family who died while it was in the making.
heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper?
on his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself:
so far so good...
so far so good...
how you fall doesn't matter.
it's how you land!

I saw a cow. - What?

ln the box.
last night, during the riot, I dashed behind a building:
wham! I ran right into a cow.
Really?

I'll cut your throat, hang you up, you'll drown in your blood!

granma! - What?
I didn't burn the school!
and you don't go to temple!
you win! I surrender!
if everyone ran from an argument, there'd be a stampede, already!
but we'd all be going the same way!
Mazeltov!
you talkin' to me?
you talkin' to me, mothafucka!
...the guy says: "For cash, I'd even murder!"
he tells his friend: "I'd even waste you."
the friend freaks, so the guy says:
"don't worry, you're a buddy."
l won't waste you for cash, I'll do it for free!
what a killer line! "For free!"
I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz!
I got it the first time.
tell your brother to come see me!
what a killer put-down! "I'll waste you for free!"
a killer line! - Killer.
I'd waste you for free." Can't do better than that!
why you so uptight?
mothafucka!
bastards wrecked everything!
check that!
I don't believe it!
how'd they get the car in?
the doorway's too narrow.
chill, Sayid! There he is.
he must be pissed off.
took him two years to get this gym!
your dope's good, Vinz.
not mine. It's Hubert's.
don't bogart, Sayid.
thought you quit smoking?
me too.
what happened here?
guess.
a fire?
you win the prize, Einstein!
kiss mine, cousin!
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.
so why'd you bust ass to get it?
cause he wanted to, dickface!
you're the dick.
you know who did it?
I don't want to know.
how'd the car get in here?
the doorway's not big enough.
we dissed them, spit on them!
but the cops didn't move an inch.
then the mothers stepped aside to make a path...
then these plainclothes pigs came out with wooden clubs.
they hit a homeboy, like real bad!
kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.
I kicked a pig right in the head!
that's a Yamaha.
more like your Mom on a Harley!
it's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.
no, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!
which Mohammed?
Farida's brother?
farida with the driver's licence?
no, Farida from the supermarket.
anyway, it was a scene.
you should've been there Hubert. It was intense.
tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop, all the fists you can eat, getting hell at home:
sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!
gimme a break! lt was war against the pigs, in living color!
I was trying to make some cash.
your bogus riot fucked it up!
when a brother goes down, I stand up!
what brother? Do I know the guy?
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.
let's go.
I mean it!
Abdel's no gangsta.
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!
gimme one.
and go broke?
don't make us cry!
I'll make you cry, Sayid!
everyone pays the same!
except Hubert, it's his building.
a buck?
a buck for one, OK two!
you're a drag!
you should try one.
got a buck? - Yeah, for me!
here.
no way, I'll remember this!
so remember. - Never forget.
don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.
how? With your sister?
don't talk that way about her!
chill out, you bogus Arab!
Sayid! Come back with that!
got any change?
we're broke!
2 bits. - We're broke.
...the judge says I go to jail, or do jobs for the City.
community service? The pits!
ever do it? Jail's bad enough!
you'd rather do time?
your bro stole a dog!
liar! - His mouth is full!
put it on my tab.
liar! Your nose is growing!
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!
beat it!
like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."
we saw that movie together! It was a 9mm. Glock!
what? - No, it wasn't!
that was a Desert Eagle.
he shot at the truck!
that wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!
what are you talking about?
a cop lost his handgun during the riot.
that's a good one!
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.
but I'd like to know who found it!
no joke!
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.
everyone's been inside, except me.
a month for theft is pathetic!
not in your league!
what league? I was never inside! - You got nabbed.
I quit in time!
come look!
we got visitors.
over here!
it's the mayor!
up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!
cut the stereo!
who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?
what's going on here?
think you're in Disneyland?
you're not allowed up here. You gotta go down.
we're causing no trouble.
still, you've got to get off the roof.
we like it up here.
off the roof.
you learn that shit at Notre Dame?
cut it out! Quiet everyone!
I'll handle this! - Forget it!
you can't stay here!
so fold your little tents, grab your chairs...
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.
who's gonna make us leave?
your goons or you, in your little uniform?
Nordeen, we're doing our job.
leave us alone!
don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.
now get lost!
sitting duck!
your mother drinks Bud!
anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.
I'm staying. - You're going.
let me stay, Nordeen.
what did I say? - You said go.
so what do you do? - I go!
OK, I'm going!
Vinz, c'mon!
don't play tough guy!
you always wimp out!
...you see 'em in porn stores.
what are they called?
g-strings.
what? - G-strings, moron.
she had one on, I swear it.
I fucked her like an animal.
we were in the room...
she kept screaming for more.
guy next door pounded the wall we were so noisy.
you dreamt you fucked her!
what?
you know the bitch? - I know her, she has AIDS.
get outta here!
Hi, we're from TV. - What's this?
were you in the riot last night?
did you break things, burn cars?
we look like looters, lady? - I didn't say that.
so what do we look like? - Nothing special.
get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.
we got work to do.
what kind of work? Stirring up shit?
for a juicy scoop! - No camera!
quit snooping in the 'hood, fuckface! Stop taping!
quit taping, dickhead!
this ain't Thoiry!
what's with all the assholes today?
that fuckin' broad...
what's Thoiry?
a drive-in safari park.
this ain't no zoo!
open up, WalMart!
you fuckin' jerks.
talk nice, we're in France.
it's 1 p. m. and you're in bed?
what's with the hair net?
lay off!
you a movie star, WalMart?
what's this shitty TV?
watch where you sit!
just sweat pants!
Where's the new TV?
it's too big to move.
I came by for my cash. Where were you?
I don't have it.
don't you know what happened?
go see what your pals did.
Foued's brother did that.
so what?
give me his address.
look what he did to my car!
look what he did!
just look!
leave that alone.
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.
walmart, it's just a car!
that's what you say!
you don't realize.
it's all I got.
cut it out!
leave that alone!
a homeboy's dying, fuck your car!
"a homeboy!" Big deal!
you disgust me!
that car's all I have. It's my life!
they're showing the riot! - My car's more important!
look, the riot.
some TV! - Sure, bust it!
fix the antenna! - I'm trying!
it's David!
how'd he get on TV?
I was over there, they missed me!
fix it! I can't see a thing! - This TV sucks!
how'd that fucker get on TV?
Hey, gimme my money!
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.
gimme my coat and get outta my face!
you guys must be happy.
a cop lost his gun in the riot.
I hope the guy who finds it uses it uptown, not here for once!
forget it, we'll get even!
you know that show, "Candid Camera"?
so this celebrity's sure he's been set up.
his buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.
the celebrity thinks they're out to get him.
he always eats in the same joint.
he's sure they'll film him there.
the others convince him there's a hidden camera.
he sees the TV truck, a camera behind the mirror and the guy with him pretends to act weird.
the celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em, pretending he hasn't noticed.
he thinks all hell will break loose.
but they just film him, jumpy, waiting for shit to happen.
so you see this guy...
cut it out, Sayid!
wasn't me! - Then who?
the celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.
each time the waiter passes he thinks it'll happen.
then a guy asks him for his autograph.
the celeb thinks it's a trick and starts ranting at the guy, who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.
they start fighting, and the candid camera guys have to break it up.
it was a killer punch out.
then what?
that's all.
who was the celebrity?
dunno, but he was real famous.
I don't remember.
this looks like trouble. See ya.
we're THE FUTURE
what did they want?
don't get mad, get even.
it's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.
party time!
we go visit Abdel in the hospital?
I gotta show you something...
that's real steel!
get a load of it. - What a mother!
what'll you do with it?
stop it, Hubert.
what you gonna do with it?
depends if Abdel dies.
you gonna kill a cop?
best way to get respect!
smoking a cop will get you respect?
it'll even up the score.
I coulda got you a piece. - This one's special.
think you're on a mission?
well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!
will it help Abdel? - It'll help us.
stop fronting!
you pussy!
you're headed for big shit!
I'll do my thing, you do yours.
I don't want to know. - So don't ask!
one thing's sure...
with that piece you're the big man.
Hey, wait for me!
fuck it...
what the fuck ya doin'?
OK, don't have a shit fit!
sorry, fellas, you can't go in.
let us in. We came to see Abdel.
sorry, I have my orders.
just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.
he's our friend.
the docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.
we won't make trouble!
if I let you in,
I'll lose my job. - Sure, flunkey!
tone it down. His family's here.
they need peace and quiet!
we're not as good as reporters?
get going!
hands off, man!
you gonna make me leave?
gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!
what's going on here?
look at that fuckface!
we came to see our pal Abdel!
we won't leave till we see him.
beat it, before I take you in.
Oh, yeah?
you shut up!
move 'em out!
we can be nice or nasty. It's up to you!
calm down!
Lieut. These kids made trouble.
I got the ringleader.
he did nothing. - I arrested the leader.
what leader? - He means Sayid.
sure, Uncle Tom!
things aren't bad enough.
you had to go to the hospital?
they were only doing their job.
doing their job?
shut your yap, once and for all!
you shut yours! - Don't talk to me like that!
same to you! - Shut up, will ya!
shit!
you don't know a fucking thing!
what do you know?
cut it out, asshole.
watch your tongue! - If you watch yours!
the bastards who beat up Abdel will go to jail!
you're dreaming.
the cops at the hospital protect Abdel and his family.
you just fuck things up!
you idiot, you got it all wrong.
those cops are just protecting Abdel!
most cops don't beat on you. They protect you!
who protects us from you?
never do it again!
who writes your jokes?
watch your tongue!
watch your mother!
you ever trash me again, you go to central lock-up.
your brother can bail you out.
I didn't ask no favors. - I did it for your brother.
he'd rip you apart!
you're the ripper.
about the boxing gym: I can get you a city grant.
you'll get another gym.
kids want to punch more than bags now!
it's hopeless. Once I could talk to the kids. No more.
and they know me! A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.
an Arab in a police station doesn't last an hour!
I have to go. Try to keep cool.
Yeah, we'll try.
outta my face, you fucker!
you shook his hand?
he's always been cool with me.
you don't shake a pig's hand!
you shoot him, I shake his hand! You're a fuckin'pain!
and you're out of it! Look!
I knew it!
you acted so weird at the hospital.
take it easy. - Let me see.
you didn't tell us?
you didn't want to know!
packing that! You retard!
I'm a big boy. Quit preaching!
I'll bust your chops!
stop it!
you feel big with that gun! I'll kick your ass!
like how?
cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.
you shut up!
I'm splittin'.
so split!
stay with us.
sayid, let him split!
don't go!
back off.
what's with him?
jerk thinks too much.
Where's Mom? - Explain this to me.
I can't now.
well?
what's the answer?
I don't know.
you never know. - OK, I never know.
Hi, Mom.
how's the kid brother?
he's fine.
but your brother in jail isn't so good.
what's with Max?
he needs textbooks.

to get a high school diploma while he's inside.
he never made grade school!
hands off the pots!
I didn't do nothing!
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

Patou, go study in your room.
mom. - Don't argue.
who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?
no, he's in Tower D.
I don't know him.
could he get us textbooks?
that's not his line, Mom.
officials now admit that a policeman lost his gun in the riot last night.
it is still missing.
we asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous in this explosive situation...
what a fuck up!
they burned down the gym.
I'm sick of the projects. I want out. It's getting worse.
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.
he's going wild, like Max.
I have to get out.
I have to leave this place.
if you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.
no credit for you.

who's the kid? - 2 kids worrying over jackshit!
I'm 100% behind you!
wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!
tell your buddy to back off! I never said I wanted to.
Yes, you did!
Yes! - No!
I didn't say that!
I said if Abdel died,
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!
without my gun back there, we'd have been history!
my name's not Rodney King!
not the same thing!
expect us to bring you gifts in jail?
I expect nothing! Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!
go ahead, laugh!
laugh!
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!
we live in rat holes, you do fuck-all to change things!
neither do you!
you're my homeys, so I'll tell you:
if Abdel dies, I hit back.
I'll whack a pig!
so they know we don't turn the other cheek now!
wow, what a speech!
haIf Moses, haIf Mickey Mouse.
forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.
if Abdel dies, we lose a friend?
right!
if a cop dies, do all cops go away?
you're just one guy! You can't blow 'em all away!
who made you a preacher?
you know what's right and wrong?
why do you side with the assholes?
who's the asshole?
ln school we learnt that hate breeds hate!
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!
bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop! We coulda been killed!
nothing like a good shit!
you believe in God? That's the wrong question.
does God believe in us?
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.
we were sent to Siberia together.
when you go to a Siberian work camp, you travel in a cattle car.
you roll across icy steppes for days, without seeing a soul.
you huddle to keep warm.
but it's hard to relieve yourself, to take a shit, you can't do it on the train, and the only time the train stops is to take on water for the locomotive.
but Grunwalski was shy.
even when we bathed together, he got upset.
I used to kid him about it.
so, the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit on the tracks.
I'd teased Grunwalski so much that he went off on his own.
the train Starts moving, so everyone jumps on, because it waits for nobody.
Grunwalski had a problem:
he'd gone behind a bush and was still shitting.
so I see him come out from behind the bush, holding up his pants with his hands.
he tries to catch up.
I hold out my hand, but each time he reaches for it he lets go of his pants and they drop to his ankles.
he pulls them back up,
starts running again, but they fall back down, when he reaches out for me.
then what happened? - Nothing.
Grunwalski...
froze to death.
good day.
why'd he tell us that?
I got the address. I'll call you.
why'd he tell us that?
excuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.
I haven't eaten for 2 days.
my child's hungry, I need your spare change...
I wanna date with Mina!
I'll lasso her!
what d'you want? My dad's in jail, my mom's in jail, my whole family is!
get a job like everyone else!
what is this, Mardi Gras?
I want Mina!
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

queen MARGOT
france is torn apart by the Wars of Religion.
catholics and Protestants have been fighting for years.
king Charles IX always let his mother, Catherine de Medici, rule.
but today the Protestant leader, Admiral Coligny, has the King's trust:
the entire country might switch over to the new religion.
to quench the hatred, Catherine sets up an alliance for peace:
she marries her daughter Margot to Henri of Navarre, her Protestant cousin.
a political scheme that everybody sees through.
but Coligny wants war with Catholic Spain. He must be stopped.
august 18. A heat wave has fallen over Paris.
thousands of Protestants have come for the wedding.
they are invading the inns and the streets.
their dark clothes and looks provoke the Parisians, already on the verge of rebellion.
Margot's wedding, a symbol of peace and reconciliation, will be used to set off the greatest massacre in the history of France.
it's up there.
ten coins for the room and two for the horse.
ten coins for that!
find someplace else.
Paris is full. With the wedding, the Protestants fell on us like the plague.
who's that!
who are you?
I'll kill him! Let me kill him!
who are you?
he just wants to sleep. Put it away. - To sleep?
well? - With me?
you'd rather sleep in the street with your Protestant friends?
what? He's Protestant?
the dust bothers you?
you bother me. I don't sleep with my brethren, even less a Catholic!
there's more of us than you.
get used to it!
there we go! Everybody in the same bed!
we're all friends now!
unity is what they want, so set the example!
you came for the wedding? - No.
that Margot is an evil whore.
the wedding shames us all.
Henri, King of Navarre, do you take Marguerite de Valois as your wife?
I do.
marguerite de Valois, do you take Henri de Bourbon as your husband?
marguerite, do you take...
in the name of God, of the Son, and his Holy Church,
I join you in holy matrimony.
by giving you my sister, I give my heart to your faith.
welcome to the family.
it's a peculiar one, but not that bad.
why not tonight? - On his wedding night?
Precisely!
he's a smelly goat. - A wild boar!
I know it's a bad day for you, but look:
my Catholics and my Protestants, together in God's house!
look, this wedding will fix everything.
a wedding and a war!
that'll fix the French.
war?
who talks of war today?
look at him!
Coligny wants war. Look!
the King's against the war.
what do you know?
the King is Coligny's puppet.
your power is finished!
do not hate me yet.
they all hate me:
your brothers, Guise...
your mother dislikes me.
yours hated me.
yours killed mine.
there was no proof.
go on, talk, but you're as scared as me. - Scared of what?
who hates you, loves me.
then why make you marry me?
for peace!
I don't have to sleep with you!
do not come to my room tonight.
Charlotte!
I got you some red blush. A gift!
who is he?
Armagnac.
he is 26. I heard he's a real fanatic.
a bit dark and skinny. Nice smile!
and this one?
du Bartas. He came with Henri.
he's 19.
he lives with his sister!
promising.
nice eyes... But short legs.
short legs?
toss him away!
Cond? Royal prince. Which one is he?
that one.
he's a pervert.
he despises me.
and him? - Henri?
what is he doing?
still drinking? Laughing? What?
they're lining up to see him.
we'll have a haven in Navarre, freedom of faith in the south, the right to bear arms...
what can the King guarantee when Catherine rules?
she doesn't rule any more. I do.
in three days you lead the army, with me.
will I still be alive in three days?
how could you marry that scarecrow?
it'll never work!
you did it with Protestants?
Oh, no!
you will, though!
I'll stick to Catholics.
look!
the tall one's Armagnac.
the short one, Du Bartas.
I'll go. - Go on!
where were you?
they'll make you convert.
No!
they will! She will!
Margot will convert you!
who is she?
Charlotte de Sauves.
a baroness. She's after you.
baroness?
do you always stare?
I fancy you, milord!
can you prove it?
you must do the proving.
whenever you want.
choose me over tonight's pleasure.
tonight?
what pleasure awaits me? A knife?
poison? Or a slap, if God's kind!
my room is above yours.
so it's tonight, or never!
tonight, as usual...
Anjou won!
and in April, Coligny, how many men did you lose?
it's not a war!
how many Protestants fought?
but it's not a war.
what is it, then? Answer me. 4, 000?
this is a crusade, not a war! They were ready to die!
but not to fight!
spain crushed them!
won't you help Flanders?
maybe not!
we are willing to help, but...
but what?
it's Spain!
we would be fighting the King of Spain!
and we're just not ready!
not to fight Europe's greatest army!
attack Spain, and France takes sides with the Protestant countries!
but if Spain wins Flanders, we'll be besieged.
you mean besieged by Catholics!
nurse!
how long to prepare?
we're ready!
why did we accept this wedding, if not to bring peace?
peace? You liar! - We want peace inside France, so Catholics and Protestants may fight together outside!
Never!
you've 6, 000 men here.
and they want to fight. They're hungry! Beware!
beware they do not start a revolt that no one can stop!
I want this war!
the King wants it too.
we'll be ready.
come feed the dog, Coligny.
white meat is better.
hand me the vegetables.
you dominate me.
you influence me too much.
you always cut me off.
you noticed?
he's a good eater.
they all say so.
everyone:
my family, and all the others.
but what I see is that you freed me from myself.
Yes, Coligny, freed me of my mother.
she's Queen no more. I'm King!
good dog, eat!
I'm King, now that you're my father.
I never trusted anyone before you.
only my nurse!
she's a Protestant too.
so, go over our battle plans.
I'll see you in the morning.
at ten, as usual.
so it's war?
Yes.
who is he?
Ren? Catherine's perfume-maker.
and her poison-maker!
that's good to know.
no perfume! - You prefer poison?
I like you Protestants!
you've not lost faith in God like we have.
Oh, I like you Catholics too.
are you really 2, 000 here?
go on, count them! They're my wedding guests.
they say it's good for France, but for me... your wedding day is a day of mourning!
I feel shame!
you had my mother killed, and now I marry your whore.
guise paid you to kill Coligny.
was it 10, 000?
I know.
a man saved him. One of his old captains, who took the bullet.
what was his name?
de la Mile.
Leyrac de la Mile.
you were in his service?
you were a son to him.
he gave you room and board.
you called him Father!
he was a father to you!
and you shot him in the back...
they want your head.
shall I give it?
sell it...
or else, use me.
tomorrow, at ten, a man will walk down
St Germain Street, to the Louvre.
how do I spot him?
he'll have a red portfolio.
like this one.
you still have Guise's pistol?
I'm better with a musket.
Maurevel!
I'd rather you use Guise's pistol.
I waited last night. You promised to say goodbye.
why say goodbye? I love you, and I'm still here!
you belong to him now.
he'll never be my husband. And you'll always be my brothers!
wake up!
he's here.
he's waiting.
out! Out!
the King told me that he isn't the cuckold any more!
I never gave you my virginity, so take my wedding night!
who took your virginity?
who?
your brothers? Which one?
take me tonight!
you've got a dagger?
isn't he coming? The wild boar...
do I look like a bride?
you look uncertain, unpredictable...
tonight, love me like never before.
I want to discover your body, your smell.
I want an endless night.
I want to see the image of my death amidst my pleasure.
I want my wedding night, but with you!
your husband's coming. He just left his room.
don't go!
you knew he'd come!
No! Don't go!
you knew it!
I'll make him leave!
after...
we'll have our longest night.
I guess I avoided Catherine's spies.
they think I'm with...
the Italian...
the pretty baroness.
go on!
go see her!
God ordered me to talk to you, and only you. I have to...
convince you!
protestants always mention God!
God...
or instinct.
Whose?
the peasant's!
as your mother calls me.
if I live, I'll be King.
my brother is King!
the other two will succeed him.
and then their children.
your chances are slim.
yours are too.
they won't protect you.
you're nothing to them.
you're a hostage for your brothers.
my brothers love me!
they'd sell you out, - and Catherine... - Mother loves me!
she'd sell you for nothing!
mother cherishes me!
she hates you!
and your lover, de Guise...
he uses you... - Stop!
for power, and to seduce women.
Why?
stop it.
did your God ask you to insult me?
no, Margot, I came to strike a deal.
will our marriage save me for a month? Days?
help me, and tomorrow
I'll give you everything.
you agreed not to come tonight, or any other night.
that's true...
it was agreed.
but give me your hand. Teach me!
lead me!
I'm blind here! These halls lead to an invisible trap.
they'll kill me. - No!
your brothers will, and you'll be a useless widow.
you can rule over them.
you can be Queen, Margot!
let go of me!
we were forced to marry.
let's outplay them.
quiet!
be my ally! Let's strike a deal! Don't be my enemy!
be quiet...
I'm not your enemy.
my friend, then?
my ally?
will you be my ally?
maybe.
now leave.
leave.
is it a brother?
a lover?
both?
I'd love to know.
I also had a coat.
I don't love him...
but I won't betray him.
stay.
it's your wedding night, not mine.
Henriette!
I need a man tonight.
let's go out.
let go of that!
protestant bastard!
that's mine!
give it back!
this must be yours.
you're from the country?
you lost everything?
my horse...
some clothes.
all my money!
lt'll be free for you, then.
not on the mouth!
my father left me this hunting book.
I heard Ren? Le Florentin might be interested.
it's for sale?
Yes, I've been robbed.
it's for sale.
it's a hunting book.
about hunting, and falconry.
Leyrac de la Mile.
is that you?
my father.
from Roussillon?
from Languedoc.
remarkable.
exquisite.
100 coins?
you came for the wedding?
I came to see Admiral Coligny.
Coligny?
a friend of my father's.
don't you know?
he's dead.
someone shot him, just a few minutes ago.
look out!
on a Friday. Like our Lord!
make way!
is that the Admiral?
is he? - A miracle! He'll live.
murderers!
you murderers!
you want us all dead!
let them through!
God will punish you.
is thatyour peace?
make way for the King!
justice will be done!
our brethren will come from all over to avenge us!
speak to them!
don't cry for revenge. Thank God who looks over you.
Coligny will live! It's only a light wound.
I'll prove my loyalty.
a ship awaits, to take you to England.
with Coligny gone, you're dead!
but he lives!
I know what they can do...
what we can do! - Don't listen!
she's a Catholic!
she's a spy!
get her out of here!
we're 1, 000!
let's gather and fight!
listen... She's warning us!
she hates us.
get her out!
she's one of them! - She's Guise's mistress!
whose side would Jesus take if he were here?
Jesus would tell your King to risk drowning at sea...
she mocks us! - But not to wait to die in a disaster.
I'm telling you to flee tonight!
first they killed your mother!
today they attacked Coligny.
you're next.
you'd come with me?
but... She's one of them!
it's true,
I'm one of them.
you can't be saved.
you'll deserve your fate.
they'll seek revenge.
they're getting ready in the peasant's room.
I feel it. I want to know who did it.
didn't you see their hatred? How they cursed us?
the Louvre will fall.
they'll kill you, your brother and sister.
they'll kill us all!
they've been mustering for weeks.
I've got weapons!
I've got men!
they're thousands.
they've got power, and will use it!
Coligny's my father.
stop calling him that!
if your father were alive, he'd know what to do!
he knew that a real King does both good deeds and bad ones!
guise knows how to attack first!
me? - They found your pistol.
fine! That's a crime
I'd have loved to commit.
nobody's blaming you, but why miss!
they blame me for Coligny?
so what!
go on, open an inquiry for Coligny!
listen to Guise! Be a useless King seeking justice!
you'll bring ruin to France, when I'm working to make it strong!
since your father died, it's me who's been doing all the dirty work!
it was you? - I'd die to save my children!
you had him shot?
me, only me...
he should have died!
we have to go all the way now.
we must kill the leaders. Tonight!
Cond? Of course, and D'Aubign?
and Navarre!
No! Not Navarre!
Coligny!
you want Coligny dead?
I do too!
so, all the others in France must die too!
there must be no survivors!
no one left to blame me for this.
how many must we kill? - Eleven.
fourteen.
all of them!
how many are we? - Enough.
name?
you know what you're volunteering for?
I do.
what about those who help them?
may God help those who help them.
and the witnesses? - The Catholics won't talk.
make sure the others can't!
a lot of people!
the King said all of them!
it has started.
get the weapons!
over there!
let him go!
move!
Henri!
Margot!
fight back!
go get De Nancay!
go to your room!
lock yourself in!
there's one upstairs. - Quick.
this La Mile's a Protestant.
why are you telling me that? - Go on!
son of a bitch!
get him!
over there!
come here!
you're a Protestant? - Yes.
of course he is!
he must convert!
you heard her. Say the Credo.
say it.
credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem... Say it!
say it!
look out!
Coligny's up there.
kick in the door!
there he is!
mine! He's mine!
it's done!
I curse you!
there he is!
I am the Queen of Navarre!
he is with me!
it's God's justice, he must die.
God doesn't want him dead! Kill me first!
why save him?
he'll die in my arms, not in yours!
you won't get this one!
how many did you kill?
only those I had to.
on Judgement Day you'll be glad to have spared one life for Our Lord. And that day may be close by.
what will you say to God?
what will you say to God?
that you finished off the wounded?
and killed a Catholic woman to do so?
I've six Catholics with me!
and I'll stab you in the heart!
so get out now!
let's go!
he's back...
it's a bad wound.
take me away. I'm ready.
I knew you would be beautiful... So luminous!
I'm ready!
take me away!
open up!
they're going to kill Henri! She wants him dead!
what?
they said they want him dead.
he didn't come to see me tonight.
where is he?
in the King's room.
let me through! Is Navarre here?
he has to convert!
he's in my room.
with them.
he won't convert.
it isn't my doing.
I didn't order this.
you believe me?
Why?
Why?
she did it.
I swear she's to blame!
you gave them Henri?
No! I brought him here to protect him. They all came later.
come with me.
No!
come on...
come on.
I'm scared!
calm down...
I don't want to go! - It's all right...
hush...
where were you?
and Armagnac? Did they kill him too?
what do we do with him?
not Henri!
don't touch him!
we'll all be damned!
we said all the leaders.
don't touch him!
you should've killed him before.
it's too late now. You wed us before God...
he's my husband, your brother.
he won't convert.
let him be!
you still won't?
Why? - Don't insist...
it's over now.
no Protestants in the family!
stop! - You understand?
let Margot deal with him.
now I know what hate is!
well, learn about hypocrisy too.
you must convert.
don't go!
what do you want?
you'll never find him.
this one?
we must forget tonight's faces.
take them away!
I wish to return to the Catholic Church...
...the Roman Catholic Church...
I wish to return to the Catholic Church...
...the Roman Catholic Church...
I renounce all
lutheran and Calvinist heresy...
and I beg you in the name of God...
of his son Jesus, and the Holy Virgin...
the most Holy Virgin Mary, his mother...
and I beg you in the name of God...
to pardon my sins among these sects...
and greet me in the community...
obedient to the Pope.
I thought you were dead. They let you live!
I too converted.
don't be ashamed. We're alive!
bells? No one's left to kill!
wrong!
your friend Cond? Got away.
one more, one less! Who cares?
you are now a proud Catholic King!
you can be proud!
proud to rule over a country full of dead bodies!
Paris is a cemetery!
your subjects are either dead or covered in shame!
you always worry about your sons.
well, don't any more - because they're damned!
and I am too!
Why?
they were my wedding guests!
and you used me as bait for the massacre!
not in public!
your family doesn't need bait to start a massacre.
how many killers did youtake along?
I finished what the King started.
No! The King saved us! Don't insult him!
how many did it take for Coligny?
stop it!
take a message to Cond?
I'm a prisoner too!
come on!
I wanted peace, Margot!
peace for the kingdom, for my children!
you are no longer to leave the Louvre.
that way you'll be with your Protestant friends.
what's wrong, Margot?
your husband's Catholic now. Don't become Protestant!
something happened last night?
something else?
I'll find out.
every night he cries out, vowing to find his enemy...
I'm the one he seeks.
I can't escape this man.
God put him on my road.
he's always hounding me.
and if he doesn't find me, I'll go after him.
stay put!
I must see her!
they say you're a faceless devil...
people fear you because you're the executioner.
yet you saved my life.
you can't even walk.
they say she can't love...
that murderous blood runs in her...
yet she saved my life!
I must see her!
no one can get near her.
or near her husband.
they can't even move around the Louvre freely.
it's better like that.
God chose me to save her.
I'll set her free.
look.
here in Amsterdam there are 2, 000 waiting to leave.
they'd rather face hunger, cold, and the unknown, than pray in the cellar, or pretend to go to Mass.
I could leave too...
No! We must fight!
I was in London, Germany... We are gaining ground.
the Catholics feel our threat!
they fear us!
I saw La Rochelle,
I got in by the sea.
guise has doubled his men, but our people die rather than convert!
guise fuels my hate!
hope shall rise among our people if we free Navarre.
how many men will you need?
only 300. Secrecy counts more than numbers.
I'm Jewish.
my wife's a Christian.
my family converted a long time ago. That changed nothing.
the law forbids us to marry Catholics.
they want to keep the blood pure!
I'll give you the money to save the King of Navarre.
even if we are of different faiths.
so he converted! She made him?
no, she saved him!
and they are both prisoners?
I don't believe it!
look!
I count seven lumps.
Anjou will live?
he'll be King?
he'll rule 14 years.
Anjou will rule after Charles.
and Alencon?
he'll rule after that?
alencon will not live to be 30.
but his son? One of my sons will have a son, right?
the liver is to the left:
three deaths followed by decay.
death?
my three sons!
decay?
Henri of Navarre...
will rule in their place.
I thought that horrid night had changed it all!
we killed 6, 000 of them...
but he's still alive!
the red is so beautiful, so pure.
there!
the blue is Venice Cream.
let me see.
it's beautiful!
you're gorgeous. Look.
they can even cry!
why should they cry?
Charlotte, I have a present for you.
come...
the red blush I promised for your lips.
for me?
at the last moment! It's a powerful aphrodisiac.
thank you!
we've invaded your rooms!
she's up to something.
and Armagnac?
where is he?
how about you?
do you know? - No, Madame, I don't.
Yes, you do!
I've had enough!
did you hear anything?
thousands have converted.
they're not so resolute after all...
and him?
him?
you need another man.
a man to arouse your body, and put your memory to sleep.
forget him. - I can't.
you forgot others!
she suspects me.
she's right.
you'd do anything!
take it off.
the blush?
everything but the blush.
don't touch her!
don't touch her!
come, it's too late for her.
where is he? She's alone.
too bad.
wait!
grab her feet.
open the window.
throw her out.
come on, throw her out!
don't stay here...
go back to bed.
Armagnac...
escaped thanks to her.
every night I see my people being slaughtered.
I hear screams, people yelling murder...
hide your grief.
hide your fear and sorrow.
keep a light heart, pretend you're free.
you've managed so far. Don't stop!
death was on her lips.
never show them you're weak!
those you love become their victims.
that's how they can destroy you.
never show them your love.
Margot, no!
I promised not to...
I didn't.
he's gone.
one day he woke up and asked for you.
you were gone, so he left.
he's living with a duchess.
he's rich...
but he's sad.
I worry about him.
a duchess?
I stitch arms as well as I chop heads!
a woman from the court?
who knows Margot?
who sees her every day?
does he live with her?
wait here.
you're alive!
thank God!
you saved my life...
and you're back to punish my sins!
thanks to you, I'll make up for all my crimes.
I can't absolve your crimes...
hit me!
I'm wretched... There is someone in me...
someone else...
someone I didn't know.
an animal, a monster.
and it gave me terrifying pleasure!
calm down.
you're my redemption, La Mile.
I beg you to hit me.
get up!
are you hungry?
you want to eat? Can I cook something?
tomato, basil and fresh onions.
it's my turn to feed you.
and the Louvre?
I'm there all the time. That's what makes me sick.
can you really get in?
they're all silk-clad vultures!
nobody cares about the massacre, except me.
you take me for an idiot?
no.
you have a letter for Henri of Navarre.
Yes!
but you want her!
you wish to free her.
help me!
No! It's too dangerous!
she saved me! - To better ruin you.
maybe...
maybe.
who managed to get you up?
you're lucky...
I can't any more.
he's the one she thought was dead, and dreams about.
I know.
you were eating?
you wish to see her?
you really do?
you shall.
every night
I dreamt of a ghost.
every morning
I hoped you were alive.
I always knew you'd recognise me.
always.
you smelt of jasmine that morning.
I thought: Maybe she's ugly under her mask?
or disfigured. But it didn't matter.
you wouldn't let me kiss you.
I thought: She's even lonelier than me.
she loves as though she is seeking revenge.
I tried to forget you, but you came to me on that horrid night!
God brought me to you.
I opened my eyes during the massacre, and there you were...
how many men?
two hundred.
they'll be in Meaux, waiting for him.
when's the hunt? At what time?
Monday.
they leave at six.
they'll be in Pontoise at nine.
they'll eat at twelve, and Henri will try to slip away.
you'll be with him?
no.
it's a wild-boar hunt.
men only!
I've tried to get you out for months!
Navarre and you, but mainly you!
I'll leave on my own.
I'm the King's sister. It'll be easy.
where will I meet you?
Henri's page, Orthon, will tell you.
Henri's already a prisoner here. Why the Bastille?
I want him locked away.
in a cell? - Yes.
he'll die!
listen, Armagnac is back from Holland.
he's with Cond? In Meaux.
so? - They're scheming.
they got money from England and Holland.
sign.
No!
not now! He's going to teach me...
to kill wild boar with a dagger.
go hunting. We'll arrest him after.
tonight's fine.
sign.
they're waiting. I'm late.
he's back?
why him?
why not? He's perfect.
after the hunt.
come on, Henri!
come to Navarre!
I can't leave Charles.
quick!
a stake!
a stake!
take my pistol!
it's no fun with a gun!
a stake!
come on!
give me one!
another one!
come on!
look out!
Anjou!
Alencon!
shoot!
shoot!
are you all right?
I suppose...
thank you, Henri.
I'm not dead, so you're not King!
not yet.
you thought about it, though!
to Paris!
to Paris? Now?
Yes, I've had enough.
come on, friend Henri!
back to the Louvre?
can you believe it?
he saved the King!
he betrayed us!
we must warn Margot!
she can wait!
they'll notice she's gone.
I'll go to the Louvre.
I want to see him.
go and get killed, then!
come along.
we're leaving.
leaving?
I'll get my coat.
No! Come now!
come on.
go on, she's waiting for you!
I thought you were dead.
again!
you must go back.
Henri saved the King's life.
they turned back before Henri could escape.
they'll see you're gone.
you must go back.
come!
Marie!
Charles!
I brought another King. A happy one, with no crown.
come, Henri.
take his hand.
hold it...
it's the hand of a brother.
without him, our child would be an orphan!
I can eat without checking my food here!
you won't say anything? Ever?
she'd kill them!
Catherine loves you. Maybe she'd only be jealous.
jealous?
she only loves Anjou. She wants to rule with him...
to make him King! King of France or Poland.
I feel happy here.
but...
does Margot know about?
nobody knows.
if she knew, maybe she'd be jealous too?
she plays sister to you, but not wife to me!
would you let Margot go free?
come sit with us!
I'd rather listen.
would you set Margot free?
today I can't deny you anything.
then let us go! I'll take her to Navarre.
Margot? In Navarre?
she'd be bored to death!
I'll teach her...
to love life.
I'll teach her...
to go swimming in rivers, to cook bread on hot stones, to drink wine, to eat garlic!
one must love life.
that's all there is in Navarre.
did you sleep with Margot?
Yes.
don't leave me, Henri.
you're my only friend.
nobody will harm you, or Margot, not as long as I live.
if we succeed, you'll go to Navarre with Henri.
you'll be safe. - I know.
you'll be Queen.
and you'll be my master, and my subject!
I love you as you are now.
naked, in exile, forgotten by all...
no past, no future...
no family, no fancy clothes to bury love!
I'm on your side, with the victims.
I won't go back to the killers.
I'll never be your subject!
please, don't ever leave me!
promise me something.
they say death always took your lovers.
they say you lock their hearts in gold boxes around your bed.
they do?
what else?
that at night, wearing a mask, I roam the city looking for love?
one day you'll know who you really are.
promise you won't forget me, the one you shouldn't have loved.
I promise.
God's hand is on this man!
come kiss me, my son.
you were brave yesterday.
your hand saved my son.
I thank you.
come!
there she is!
the Protestants believe you betrayed them!
they can't understand!
what is betrayal...
but one's skill in following the flow of events?
you've made great progress!
I'm learning from you.
where were you last night?
do you know?
I gave the King my word.
Anjou is leaving. My heart bleeds...
I love my three children.
I mean, all four of them...
why come back? Wasn't he good enough?
I came back for you! La Mile would die to free us!
us? - He'd die for us!
he'd die for another night with you.
his life is no use to me.
have you gone mad?
don't you care who they killed?
your blood will soon be on the wall! You must go, flee as soon as you can!
Charles trusts me.
you did it for a reason!
and he knows it!
I saved him, and he saved me.
to leave would be betrayal.
to stay is betrayal!
to hear you say that is shocking!
it sounds like you mean it!
you betrayed your faith. Now it's your friends!
you grovel at Charles's feet.
last night he was different.
he always is!
I know him so well...
I love him!
I'm going to wash.
you once asked me to be your ally.
so I guided and protected you.
now it's my turn to ask.
let Navarre be a haven for me!
take me to Navarre.
take me with him!
whom do you wish to rule over? Navarre, your lover, or me?
I only slept with you so people would know!
you've no right over me.
they're inseparable. They're out hunting again.
just the two of them!
it stinks!
what is it? - The King has sold...
...yes, sold, your brother to the Poles.
do you know what he said?
what if we sent the boy...
meaning you - "to Navarre, so Henri can stay with me?
do you know why he wants Henri here?
so Margot will stay.
one day he'll get rid of me!
hands off!
you're 17 now...
can you keep a secret?
Margot's soon to be a widow.
this is a book on falconry.
perfect for learning about falconry.
who cares about falconry?
put it in Henri's room.
it's such a rare book... So scarce...
it has been closed for so long that the pages are stuck together.
one must wet one's finger, page after page, to turn them.
look, the brat!
you're white as a sheet!
you're reading?
it's amazing!
the best hunting book ever written.
look: La Mile. Do you know the name?
are you listening?
he's Margot's lover.
a man of taste!
both in women and books!
I must meet him!
why are the pages stuck?
every day I'll send a messenger.
you'll know everything...
about the family, France...
every day, until I call you back for good.
I'll pretend to be their King.
but my heart will be here...
with you.
you'll be back soon, dear eyes, my conqueror!
I'll die!
to the King of Poland!
now we're all kings!
Anjou in Poland, me here...
you, in Navarre!
you want Navarre?
it's yours!
nature, wine, garlic...
and hunting!
the other day, my emotions...
they nearly made you kill the horseman instead of the horse!
damned emotions!
God can do so much with so little!
how was war?
how was the countryside?
your eyes are bulging.
the cuckold's horns are pushing out from behind?
like this!
it bothers you!
it's eating you up!
don't look at me like that!
la Mile!
a courier, a plotter...
a pure heart, mind you!
but he does screw your wife!
does Henriette watch? I hear she loves to!
a slut at heart! - Stop it!
you know La Mile? A survivor!
Margot saved him that night!
right, Margot?
never in... - Public, I know!
they made a pact.
you're mad, Margot!
the husband remains blind and the wife mute.
my farewell party makes them sad.
please, stop!
what's this?
what's that scar? On your arm...
look!
teeth marks! Was it you?
Charles, you bit her!
a long time ago...
show them!
show them my mark!
show your tattoo!
she cut herself, and we rubbed dirt in.
it all closed up.
it's on her thigh, up here.
show them!
tell us about La Mile!
he taught me love, pleasure!
tell us more!
he is a magical lover. He is a prince.
and you're a dog in women's jewellery!
lucky for us you're sterile!
I'm burning!
my throat!
my belly!
you're not gone yet!
it's all right...
it's over now.
I feel better.
the poison ate up the bowels.
are you sure?
as though I made it myself.
a blend of arsenic.
a slow poison.
what would a man feel?
headaches, burning throat and stomach.
then it would stop.
as though it were over.
then pure fire... until death.
a quick death?
no. But a sure one.
recognise this book?
No!
you poisoned Henri's mother's gloves!
and Charlotte's blush!
I'll have you burnt to bits! Whose book is it?
I gave it to Queen Catherine.
she wanted...
Navarre to read it!
it hurts! I'm on fire!
your Protestant rabble... Cond? And all...
they're waiting for you at the pavilion.
waiting for me?
la Mile's there.
go on!
go rule over Navarre!
with me dead, they'll kill you. - Margot?
she's ours. - She's my wife!
she's ours! - You promised!
you promised!
I promised you nothing.
she'll never go.
leave! Go straight through the marsh. They're waiting!
it's blood.
he's sweating blood.
please leave, Madame...
I'll get the doctor.
get out!
leave!
I'm staying. I'm your mother.
she who gives life is no longer a mother once she takes that life back!
I've read too much.
do you understand?
it wasn't meant for you, I swear!
it was for the peasant.
he wants you dead!
he wants all my children dead!
if he lives, it means the end of our family!
the end of my beloved sons!
you only love one of them.
that's not true!
burn it.
la Mile.
Margot tried to leave with that man.
Margot will never leave.
burn the book.
burn it!
what about him? Where is he?
with Henri's Protestants.
without Margot?
he left without her?
he won't be back, and Margot will forget him.
but what if he does?
he deserves to die...
what for?
for screwing Margot!
for poisoning the King!
I was weak, but my ordeals enlightened me...
you were weak, but we are proud of you.
prince Henri, welcome back to our faith!
God welcomes you back!
he will help you conquer France!
I am cleansed of all evil and rot!
I obeyed that family to save my life!
forgive me, and my cowardice!
now I am myself again, at last!
my life and my courage are yours!
together we shall make God's love triumph!
I won't abandon Margot. - You have!
I won't leave her.
she's Catholic! She's one of them. It's over!
she never once betrayed me!
can you say the same?
but she never loved me.
if she must come, don't go yourself. Send someone else.
you go, then.
Orthon will help.
but they'll fight for her.
tell Margot that Navarre will forever be a haven for her...
and for those she loves.
what's Orthon doing?
he's with the horses.
Margot will be here any minute now.
and Henriette's coming too.
look out! We've been found out!
you poor, innocent victim of duty!
you'll die here.
fight, Coconnas!
for each one you kill, a sin shall be forgiven!
God's watching you!
stop!
you saved him once.
that's enough!
they're off to the Bastille!
get up!
go to the King!
speak to him!
that's my favourite dress.
Charles! I love him...
where were you?
I love him.
for days now, you've been hiding in your room.
you didn't want to see me?
I've changed...
you still love me?
it's blood...
it doesn't matter!
keep a smile on your lips!
stifling one's grief is an honour to the dead.
they're not dead!
I am dead!
I'd have been sad to die without you.
you won't die! I'll stay with you.
he did nothing but help me and love me.
that's not a crime!
please let him go.
no, that's not a crime.
let me have him, Charles! Set him free!
to my room...
only Margot!
you too have loved in secret...
pardon La Milefor me.
he poisoned me!
no, he didn't!
but we must say he did.
Why?
who poisoned you?
let me carry him!
is she here?
can you see her? - Yes.
lift me up so I can see her.
at the window, over there.
in her blue dress.
where? - She's crying.
where is she?
hold me!
hold me!
you too must forgive.
sign...
sign La Mile's pardon!
what time is it?
five o'clock.
it's too late, then.
too late?
too late...
Marie...
I loved you so!
Margot...
Lord! I come to thee without crown or sceptre.
forget the King's crimes, and remember only your child's sufferings...
my conqueror! You are back!
we shall do great things.
I only wish to please God.
we shall stop the war! We shall stop all hatred.
we shall be gentle yet strong...
king Charles IX is dead!
king Charles IX is dead!
long live King Henri III!

your brother is dead.
on one hand...
he made a huge mistake, venturing out ill prepared.
the animal that threatens us is a "cat."
the most dangerous animal there is
he eats meat. Children's flesh in particular.
if you stay inside, you are protected
we have to be ready.
our dear brother we're sorry you couldn't kill the cat, as I did.
it's a pity that this would happen to you and I wasn't able to use my knowledge to save you.
my dear brother, I would have never imagine that things could go so wrong.
I hoped that you'd survive on the supplies i secured for you.
but there are too many dangers.
I'm so sad ...
you press three times on the chest. With force.
then you block the nose, open the mouth and you blow.
I am pregnant.
a boy and a girl. Twins.
how about two boys?
no, a girl and boy.
are you sure? - Yes.
how about triplets?
it would be too much.
you're right. Twins.
the same thing on your backs.
the same thing facing front.
O. K.
dive in.
ready?
soon, your mother will give birth to two children and a dog.
I know some of you will resent having to share a room clothes, or even toys.
but you must look on the bright:
you'll have two more people to care for you.
the family will grow bigger
and I want us to applaud your mother for this big gift.
I don't want to share my room.
if you're a good girl, you will not have to.
I will be good.
I don't want to share either.
if your behavior and your performance improves,
I may not have to give birth.
but if things don't change, I will have no other choice.
but I won't hear a thing about the dog.
he will be born as soon as possible
great, darling, bravo to you all.
dry yourself and come get your reward.
dry your hands, or it won't stick anymore.
one more thing.
your performance was worse than last time
I shouldn't say more.
Oh! A plane.
it fell in the garden.
not so hard, you're hurting me.
like that?
softer.
like this?
good.
you want me to lick you so you'll give me gift?
it's okay.
here's a nice spot.
good morning. How many hours did you sleep
about 9.
be careful of the pinky!
daddy!
I think they're sargos but I'm not sure.
you should catch them. Mom will be so glad if I'm right.
I'll be there in a minute.
there's three of them.
it was just two before. the third probably just swam in.
the most creative time for man is ...?
between 30 and 40 years of age.
and for women?
between 20 and 30.
a child is ready to leave his house when ...?
when the right dogtooth falls off.
or the left one, doesn't really matter.
at that time, the body is ready to face all dangers.
to leave the house in safety one should use the car.
when can one learn to drive?
when the right dogtooth grows back.
or the left, it doesn't really matter.
mom, what is a "cunt"?
where did you learn that word?
on a case on top of the VCR.
a cunt is a large lamp.
example:
the cunt switched of, and the room got all dark.
do you want to hear your grandfather singing?
yes
mom loves us.
do we love them?
Yes, we love them.
I love my brothers and sisters
spring fills my house.
spring floods...
my little heart.
my parents are proud of me, because I do my best.
but I'm always trying to do better.
my house, you're beautiful and I love you.
and never ...
I will never leave you.
I dreamed of you the other day.
I was in a forest with your father.
in the evening we grilled potatoes.
suddenly, we heard noise in a bush.
it was you ... you were a zombie.
your father and I, we threw stones at you.
a zombie.
do you see dreams? - Sure.
tell me a recent one.
I saw Mom falling in the pool.
and then what?
nothing. Just that.
I've brought another gift. Hair gel.
you put it in your hair to model it.
I don't like it.
what do you mean?
I do not like this gift. Besides, I don't believe you.
you said that the headband sparkled. It was a Lie.
it's true! It sparkles.
you did something wrong.
I don't believe you.
look here.
look at me.
look.
I have nothing else.
I want these.
I can't give them to you.
I want them. - Impossible.
then you must leave.
I can't give them to you.
get out. I will never lick youagain!
and I'll tell my parents you gave me a headband. And that you asked me to lick you down low, at your keyboard. And all that happened.
you know what dad do if he finds out that I lick your keyboard?
you should give them back to me next week.
mommy, what's a zombie?
where did you hear this word?
don't remember. Dad probably said it.
a zombie is a small yellow flower.
what are you doing there?
I couldn't sleep. I'm nervous.
I'm afraid.
if you won't go out in the garden alone nothing will happen to you.
I won't let anything happen to you.
dad, I want to learn how to fight.
what did you say? I can't hear you.
when do I learn to fight?
you can shut down your robot?
I'll fight, so you won't have to.
you need to use your head for something else than a punching bag. Like I do.
your head does not look like a punching bag.
no.
that's good. Thanks.
it looks like a baseball glove.
you're a wise guy, ha?
Mr. Balboa, Mr. Creed's on the phone.
there are all kinds of sharks.
hammerhead, the blue shark, mako, white shark.
it's unlikely that those fools got the right one ...
this kind of shark does not live here.
highly unlikely.
I don't mean that this is not the shark we look for.
I think it is, Martin.
he's a man-eater.
man-eater!
his jaws do not correspond to the bites on the victim.
we all want to be sure, No?
anyone else seen them?
no. Nobody.
bring me the masking tape.
I want you to call me Bruce.
what is Bruce?
a name.
when you call me Bruce, I'll respond
I also want a name like this.
choose a new one. Whatever you want.
I want to be called Backbone.
you can't be called that.
a backbone is a backbone.
Bruce!
Bruce!
Bruce!
Bruce!
thank you.
where is the perfume I gave you?
in the bathroom.
it is a very good perfume
my wife insisted that we should buy that perfume as a present for you
at first, we were thinking of getting you a vase.
but we thought it would not find it's place in your house.
you live here alone?
Yes. My parents live on the 4th.
I wish your children get all the wrong stimuli and grow to be bad.
I wish it with all my heart.
let this be the punishment for your wrongdoings to my family.
she hit me with a hammer!
he's lying, it wasn't me!
I just saw a cat with a hammer jumping out the window.
she did it.
the pain makes you delirious.
he needs a plaster and painkillers.
it must be broken, Dad.
did you do like we said?
you have taken precautions?
he didn't have time, dad.
from what i saw it was a really fast cat.
very, very fast.
you spend less time with children.
don't cry. The children will see you.
have you've combed your hair today?
Yes.
I had a hard day.
we'll have to replace Christina.
nobody should come here anymore.
I think about handing the task to our elder daughter.
unless we let him decide for himself.
that's maybe better.
if you do it again, I'll gut you, you bitch.
I swear on my daughter's life that you and your gang will soon flee the neighborhood.
mom!
I found two little zombies.
should I bring them?
mom!
mom!
today is our wedding anniversary.
to celebrate, we'll eat cake and decorate the house with lights and balloons.
sit up.
I think my dogtooth is shaky.
I don't think so. It doesn't even move.
did you sleep well last night? - Great.
dad, I'm tired. Can I stop now?
Yes, my darling, if you can't keep on.
enough!
dad, you'll give me the spear gun?
I've already said, it is dangerous.
I can lick you ear if you want.
Bruce!
Bruce!
I'll go get the dog tomorrow.
I can't believe how long it's taken us to realize that we can have this great sex with no romantic attachments.
I invited Derek Stephenson to spend a few days at the Montecito.
Derek, Delinda's old boyfriend from college?
so you like him? -Yeah.
we still gonna be able to, you know...once in a while?
I don't know.
Delinda and I are getting married.
am I doing the right thing, Danny?
I cann't answer that.
woody, I need a date to Delinda's wedding. - Delinda's wedding?
who is this?
you know who this is.
we got less than 20 hours to debrief you.
debrief me? I'm in the hotel business.
I want you. - Sarasvati?
I'm gonna explode.
ed, you don't just walk away from the Company.
watch me.
not here.
I'm sorry, mom.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
I'm serious.
Hey, Sam. Hi, Mary. Wow. Are you ready?
coming, honey.
what do you in here?
you're not supposed to be here.
I have to talk to...
code Red. Code Red. It's not drill. Repeat, this is not drill.
armed suspect, 50 West, shot fired.
Danny... I gotta go.
Danny, wait. Delinda?
Derek. I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
it's bad luck.
we need to talk.
one second.
I still can't believe Sarasvati exploded without me.
please, that girl exploded everywhere and with everyone.
what's that supped to mean?
she went out with the strippers last night.
all of them?
Yes, all of them.
code Red. Code Red. All security personnel.
armed suspect, 50 West, shot fired.
repeat, shot fired. Oh, God.
I hope it's not one of my clients.
code Red. All security personnel.
code Red.
sorry, ladies. Duty calls.
if we can just find the bride.
it's so typical of Delinda to be late for her own dding.
excuse me. Casey?
status.
Mr. Manning has been moved to safe location.
the gunman is in Mr. Deline's suite.
at least one shot has been fired.
is Ed in there with him?
Yes.
lock down the floor. And find Danny now.
lockdown 50 West.
talk to me, Mike.
the gunman is in Ed's suite with Ed.
at least one shot has been fired.
is he hit?
Mary? Hey.
where are Ed and Delinda?
is there something going on that I don't know about?
no, Delinda got cold feet, so she went to talk to Ed.
I can't get either of them on their cell phones.
something's wrong.
Oh, no.
you know Delinda.
I'm sure she just wants to make a big entrance.
you're probably right.
I know I'm right. Okay.
Uh...would you excuse me?
what's going on?
Derek, we need to talk.
okay...
what?
Jillian, there's, um...
just tell me.
okay, there's a man in Ed's suite.
he has a gun.
at least one shot was fired.
I want every elevator and stairwell secured.
is Delinda with Ed? Is she there?
I don't know.
Delinda, what's going on?
don't do it, Danny. Wait for the SWAT team.
SWAT team is on their way.
there's no time.
Hey, what's going on?
wait for the SWAT team, Danny!
drop the gun or I blow your head off.
drop it now.
let's move people. We gotta move on this.
let's go!
where is Delinda?
I don't know.
Derek, I think maybe we rushed into this.
Yeah.
and maybe we were living a little in the past and got swept up in the moment.
Yeah, and the whole Vegas atmosphere.
you know, that didn't help either, right?
exactly.
but I am still in love with you, Delinda.
I always have been and I always will be.
but, Derek...
Shh.
I let you get away once.
and I am not gonna let it happen again.
Mike, call Jillian and Delinda.
tell 'em we're on our way to the hospital.
tell 'em I'll meet 'em there.
Yeah, okay.
all right. Thank you.
okay, Danny is with Ed on their way to the hospital.
there's a car waiting to take you there.
where is Delinda?
Delinda's with Derek. Mike's on his way to get them.
just have 'em meet Jillian at the car?
meet Jillian at the car.
Mike, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Delinda, your father's been shot.
what?
Danny's with him. They're heading to the hospital.
Oh, my God.
come on, Ed. Don't go dying on me.
I can't find an entry wound.
are you sure he was shot?
they said one shot was fired.
there is bullet hole.
what the hell's in there?
what it is, it saved Deline's life.
lucky bastard.
what about the blood on his forehead?
that's a surface wound.
so maybe the bullet grazed him.
it's possible, but I think he may have had a heart attack.
how's my father?
he's... We're almost to the hospital.
Danny, how is he?
looks like the bullet missed, but he might have had a heart attack.
how is he?
they're almost to the hospital.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
we have an announcement to make.
the wedding will be postponed until further notice.
but please feel free to enjoy the gaming tables.
and the restaurants and the spa.
Deline's alive.
who the hell shot him?
wasn't me.
damn it.
run it to me, fellas.
male, 60s, unconscious at the scene.
contusion over the left forehead.
B. P. 150 over 60.
possible cardiac arrest.
prep Five, please, and get Dr. Fasberg down here, stat.
let everybody know we have Ed Deline's coming into the E. R.
come on, look up.
just give me one look.
Mike, this may not be appropriate given everything that's happening, but we have a card cheat on single deck blackjack.
had Aces and Jacks up his sleeves.
Danny caught one a couple of days ago.
this is the second one we've caught tonight.
looks like we might have a team.
shut down the single jack pit.
can't. They're full of high rollers, including two of Sam's clients.
call and Sam and tell her to meet me on the floor.
Sam, it's Shannon.
doctors don't know anything yet, but he's alive.
we need to see Ed Deline right away.
it's a matter of national security.
apparently the Montecito has a sleight of hand cheating team or there's a group of magicians in town practicing their card tricks.
I need to shut down the single deck blackjack pit.
that's not a good idea.
my high rollers aren't gonna like it.
in fact, they'll probably go to another casino.
Hey, any word on Ed?
nothing yet.
you guys haven't seen Casey, have you?
he just ran off with security without saying a word.
well, they took him to a safe location.
a safe location. Why?
any time anything like this happens
Casey disappears.
he's paranoid of being kidnapped.
there's a lot of things about Casey you don't know.
Hey! Really?
this is Danny now. Hey.
Hey, it's me. The bullet missed.
but they think he may have had a heart attack.
a heart attack?
I'll call you guys back when I know more.
okay.
a heart attack? Uh...
Oh, that's great.
he probably found out Danny and Delinda were sleeping together again.
is that true?
Delinda and Danny? No! No, Mary, it's not true.
it's kind of rude of Casey just to run off like that without saying a word.
am I the only one who didn't know?
about Danny and Delinda?
well...you and Ed.
but please don't have a heart attack, Mary.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
I wanted to tell you, but Sam wouldn't let me.
what are you talking about?
I'm the only one who wanted to tell her.
that's not true!
I'm so, so sorry about your wedding.
I'll be right back.
I'm sure Ed's gonna be fine.
we'll just...
we'll have the wedding in a couple of days.
you think she was serious when she said she was never speaking to us again?
Yeah, I think she was. This is Sam.
no, I won't hold. No, I don't hold.
we just caught two more players with cards up their sleeves.
maybe Ed's shooting was a diversion.
have Mitch call Metro and get an ID on the gunman.
Yes, it's me. What...
Uh-huh. What?!
what do you mean he won't leave the villa?
how much?!
well, why didn't you tell me this three weeks ago?
uh, are you insane?
what in the world would make you think that I would want to comp him half a million dollars worth of services?
well, you thought wrong.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. What's your name again?
one, you're a dumb-ass.
and two, this conversation is over.
you're fired.
can I see the chart, please?
what's going on?
I've been trying to tell everyone.
I...
are you in love with Danny?
Oh, Delinda.
take him to holding.
Mike, listen, I have a problem.
you see Woody?
woody's here?
Yeah, he's looking all over for you.
he said you invited him to the wedding.
Yeah, I did.
well, forget about Woody. Listen, I have a problem.
one of my whales refuses to leave the Montecito's Hawaiian Villas.
he's been camped out for a month.
running up an extensive bill.
caviar, champagne, local strippers.
the Hawaiian Villas?
Yeah. I heard they're nice.
not that I'd know.
I haven't been down there personally, but first chance I get I'm going surfing.
fascinating.
we're talking about my problem right now.
right, sorry. He refuses to leave unless I personally present myself at his villa.
he's also under the false impression that the Montecito is gonna be picking up the tab for month-long visit and unique taste.
Oh, you're right. You do have a problem since you're personally responsible for your clients and their bills.
Oh, so you're not helping.
well, I'm just telling you like it...
I have a business problem and you're not interested...
this is Mike.
he's gonna be okay.
that's great news, Delinda. That's great news.
ed is going to be okay.
good, 'cause I have to go to Hawaii.
when? Now.
what about Woody?
tell Woody that I'll be back by tomorrow night at the latest.
have Mary watch my clients, but if there's any problems, you call me.
and I'm taking the jet.
we're still waiting on the blood work to know if he had a heart attack, but he's had a major concussion.
we'll just be a minute.
Oh, God.
I thought I'd died and gone to hell.
ed, we had nothing to do with the shooting.
all we wanted to do was get you back to Langley for the debriefing on Karim Sharif.
you're giving me a very large headache.
the company is sending a team after him.
waste of time.
I don't know what you did, or what you think you did 20 years ago, but Karim Sharif is very much alive.
Hmph.
now where do we find him?
six feet under.
all right, that'll be all, fellas.
visiting hours are over.
what's going on? Those friends?
how you doing, pal?
I'm not the one getting shot at.
you okay?
I guess I hit my head when I caught that table I was trying to dive under.
apparently I'm not as quick as I used to be.
Ed? Hey, sweetie.
Oh! Are you okay?
they said you had a heart attack.
me? A heart attack?
first of all, you have to own one of those in order for that to happen.
no, I didn't have no heart attack.
I hit my head, that's all.
I'm really sorry about the wedding.
I'm so sorry.
there's not gonna be wedding, Daddy.
where is he? The wine cellar.
maybe you can talk some sense into him.
well, I'll try.
Derek go back to Myanmar?
I don't know.
he's a little upset about this whole thing.
you want me to talk to him?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
okay.
Hey.
Mmm. What's...
Thanks.
for what?
for feeling the same way about me that I feel about you.
you do feel the same way about me, don't you?
Yes.
Oh.
don't screw this up, Delinda.
I won't.
what's hell wrong with you? Would you slow down a little bit?
I feel a little bit sick.
Where'd you learn to drive, Samoa?
Aloha. Welcome to Hawaii.
Aloha, my ass.
who puts a hotel in the middle of a jungle?
Where's your manager? Great.
Oh, crap
what's going on?
I've got some business to take care of.
yeah? What kind of business?
I'll be leaving town for a little while.
if anybody should ask...
just tell 'em I'm at the house recuperating.
naturally, while I'm gone, you'll be in charge.
you're going after Sharif, aren't you?
I just can't believe
I didn't know how Delinda felt about Danny.
I didn't know either. You didn't know?
Hey, Mary. Hey, Derek.
Hey, come on, Mary.
how long is this not speaking to me treatment gonna go on?
so is there anything else you need?
guess I could use a ride to the airport.
of course, we can take care of that for you.
now if you're excuse me,
I think that Jewel and her band are just checking in for the show tonight.
thanks for everything.
tell Jewel I said... Come on, Mary!
look, no offense, but do you think maybe when you hit your head you might have had the sense knocked out of you?
Danny, believe me.
I really don't want to be doing this.
well, then why are you?
the truth is the CIA wouldn't be going through all this trouble on some 20-year-old operation unless I had some validity today.
then why not just go to Langley?
for one, I don't trust them.
and two...
if what they're saying is true, it's my mess.
you know? So...
the best thing I can do right now
the Company already cost me one of my daughters.
just because you leave doesn't mean that Jillian and Delinda are gonna be safe.
if I move, they'll follow.
okay, then let me help you.
let me go with you.
I appreciate that, pal.
but no, thanks.
look, if something should happen, you're the only one I trust with the family.
answer your phone. It's just Sam.
come on, answer the phone, answer the phone.
come on, answer your phone.
answer the phone.
she's in the middle of a big problem right now.
one of her whales racked up a half million dollars in charges and they're trying to stick the Montecito with it.
I want you to think about what you're doing.
take care of Delinda, huh?
I'll see you, buddy.
yeah?
listen, just out of curiosity, why aren't you answering your phone
I just did.
okay, I'd like you to get on an airplane and come here right now.
I'm a little busy right now.
listen to me. You don't seem to understand.
Casey's little brother is the manager here.
I know.
don't you read the memos he sends out?
why would I read a memo from Casey?
because then you would know his little brother's the manager there.
get your ass on an airplane and come here right now, please.
what have you got against Casey's little brother, Sam?
nothing!
sounds like a little more than nothing to...
Hello?
son of a...
Hello, Sam.
it's been a long time.
Hi, Vic.
he's gone.
what's this?
my dad's wedding present to me.
a metal house?
sterling silver.
daddy was going to build Derek and I a house as a wedding present.
right next to his, of course.
of course.
Mary, this is ridiculous.
it wasn't my place to tell you.
Mary, please?
pretty please.
this is Mike.
Mike, it's Shannon. You better get up here ASAP.
someone's tapped into the surveillance feed.
they're seeing everything we are.
what kind of an idiot lets a guest rack up a half million dollar bill?
Casey has very specific orders concerning you and your clients.
Yeah, I'll bet. What are they?
whatever Sam wants, Sam gets.
Really?
it still doesn't explain what kind of an idiot would let a guest rack up a bill for half a million dollars.
he's your client, Sam.
he said you okayed everything.
you're an idiot just like your brother.
Oh, why you gotta be so mean?
it's my nature.
Brian, open up! It's Sam!
open the damn door! It's Samantha Marquez.
what do we got?
some kind of tap in the system.
any idea where it's coming from?
external, and very sophisticated.
I got Metro's footage of the gunman's confession.
streamlining it now.
ten grand and he just takes it from me.
get Danny on the phone.
I told Deline I was gonna get him for what he did.
nobody cheats Barry Berona.
nobody!
I don't suppose you tried your passkey.
give it to me.
unbelievable. Idiot.
you still can't be mad at me because of what happened between us?
nothing happened between us.
Hey, Sam.
Brian, what the hell is wrong with you?
do you have any idea how...
what is that smell?
Oh, my God. Please don't tell me...
I didn't kill her.
I guess now we know why he wouldn't open the door.
chicken?
okay, so you guys are like Hawaii Five-O, right?
you ever say, "Book 'em, Danno"?
ms. Marquez, we're trying to find out how long the body's been here and exactly what happened.
I don't know about any of that 'cause I just got here.
the only thing your client, our suspect, will say is, "Talk to Sam."
and you're Sam.
Yes, I am Sam, but...
your client told us that you provided him with the stripper.
okay, hold on.
I didn't provide anybody with a stripper.
I'm just the man's casino host.
and everyone knows that Las Vegas casino hosts provide their clients with anything they ask for.
well, that's... that is true.
but, uh...
you know what? I'm sorry.
I think I need to speak to my attorney before I answer any more questions.
so I'm just gonna make a quick phone call, all right?
Aloha.
you must be...tsss! Sam.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
your client's attorney.
you're an attorney?
well, attorney slash private eye.
no, no, dude, you don't have a law degree.
he doesn't have a law degree, right?
actually, I got my law degree online between sets of waves.
took a dozen or so years...
ahem...longer than originally planned.
this is perfect.
this is just what I need.
another idiot. Hold on.
this is Sam.
Sam, it's Mary.
I'm only speaking with you because I'm a professional and this conversation is work related.
that's great, Mary.
listen, I need to ask you something.
why didn't anybody tell me that Casey made his little brother manager of the Hawaiian Villas?
maybe you should've read Casey's memos.
okay, forget that. Listen, I have a problem.
Hey, Mar.
Sam has a problem.
Hello? Hello?
Hey, Sam, just ran into Woody in the lobby.
didn't know you had to go all the way to Boston to get a date. He's pissed.
you should probably call him before he gets on the plane.
Where's he going?
back to Boston. Why?
I don't know. He didn't say.
you know, don't you?
last one to know everything.
I wanted to tell you.
but then Derek showed up and then things just got out of hand.
got out of hand?
is that how you explain what's been going on?
I'm sorry. Delinda, I don't want to talk about this.
why didn't you tell me that Casey made his little brother manager of the Montecito?
would you slow down? You sound like a chipmunk.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
two of Sam's clients want credit extensions.
Davidson, one million. Perry, two.
okay, Davidson wants a credit extension.
one million. Perry, two.
okay, listen to me.
give Davidson 750 grand.
hold on Perry till you find out how many markers he has out around town.
he may be extended at more than one casino.
sorry, do you mind?
give Davidson 750. Hold on Perry.
Yes.
Mary, wait.
Hello?
what's the problem?
okay, first of all, Casey's little brother is an idiot.
I don't know if you're aware of this or not.
and apparently so is my whale, who's racked up half a million dollars and put it on my account.
and I just walked in and found him with a dead stripper in his bed.
whoa, back up.
you said they found a dead stripper in his bed?
Yes, why do you think we're having this conversation?
there is a stripper, and she's dead.
maybe the tap has something to do with the card cheaters.
hmm, it's too sophisticated for them.
they do remind me of a bunch of frat boys.
I'll check a see if any fraternities or college groups checked in.
Yeah.
Oh, this doesn't look good.
cat fight.
Where's the Hawaiian Villas Head of Security?
I...don't think he's gonna be much help.
hold on, I got another call.
No...do not put me on hold! Danny, do not put me on hold!
yeah?
Hey, just a heads up.
Mary and Delinda just got into a heated discussion.
Delinda's in tears, and Mary's heading right for you.
Hey.
how could you do this to me?
how could I do what?
you made me look like an idiot.
look, Mary. The Delines are like family...okay!
and what am I?
okay.
why don't we get back to that tap?
you know what I mean, Mary.
no, Danny, I have no idea what you mean.
maybe you can explain it to me.
since my father died, they became like family.
ms. Marquez, please hang up the phone.
just shut up for one second.
ms. Marquez, hang up that phone or you'll be arrested.
okay, well, go ahead and arrest me, but just keep it down, okay?
because you will not believe this...
so they're your family. Yeah.
I got news for you, Danny McCoy.
you're the only family I ever had.
that's not what...
that went well.
Thanks.
I was just kidding.
you're not in Las Vegas anymore, Ms. Marquez.
we take murder very seriously in the islands.
Yeah, but can't you guys take a joke around here?
how you doing today?
how'd it go with Mary?
not well.
you should've told her.
she's not talking to me.
I can't deal with the cold shoulder, man.
not from Mary.
so where are you with the tap situation?
can't identify the source.
this has CIA written all over it.
Seriously?
Yeah.
do you think Ed is in some kind of trouble?
I don't know.
so, you know any more about the card cheats?
uh, yeah, looks like a bunch of frat boys in town trying their version of the MIT card cheating scam.
shut down the single deck 21 pit until we can account for all of them.
Sam's whales will walk if we shut down the pit.
set up a table with a few incentives.
great idea.
I'll see if I can shut down this tap.
Oh!
you two make a cute couple.
Thanks.
what's that?
it was mailed to me with your name on it.
I think it has something to do with your whale.
could you excuse me for just a minute?
okay, thanks
just give me...
you've gotta get me out of there.
we can't shut down the tap without shutting down our entire system, which would leave the Montecito completely blind.
is there a way we can get into their server?
hmm.
you mean send a virus or a Trojan horse?
Yeah.
the CIA's computers. Right.
Yeah, that's not a bad... Wait a minute.
I think they call that treason, Danny, which when last I checked is punishable by death.
no, thanks. I'll pass. I got it.
remember that spammer that flooded the Montecito's computer system with all that... Spam, yeah.
right, do we still have all those files of spam kept as evidence?
we'll flood their feed with spam.
they're already in our system.
and if they, you know, sort of accidentally hit those evidence files, I mean...
about 200 million messages will download.
and even their server wouldn't be able to handle it.
so you think you can help their tap find our spam files?
so how'd you get me out so quick?
you just have to know the Hawaiian way.
where we headed?
my office.
your office is on the beach.
Yep! Of course.
listen...
uh, excuse me.
do you have any idea what's on the flash drive?
I have no idea.
it's encrypted.
I thought maybe you'd know.
that's great.
well, I don't, but I do know someone who can help us.
do you surf?
do I look like I surf?
well, you do have a very nice low center of gravity.
it's been a few years since we've seen you, Mr. Locken.
Yeah, I've been busy.
thank you.
and why exactly is this a Montecito problem, Sam?
because it's gonna be a problem with everything.
bad P. R. bad everything.
sounds to me like this is a "Sam problem." Yeah.
Ugh! Okay.
please.
what?
please.
what? Please.
okay, fine.
we'll help.
only because I can't stand to hear you beg.
I don't know what happened, but the tap disappeared.
Hey! Hmm!
later.
Derek, I'm so sorry.
so am I.
Delinda, we would've been good together.
you okay?
Yeah.
it's just been a wild last few days.
Yeah, I noticed.
Mary's pissed at me.
me too.
now what?
let's see what happens.
what if I screw it up again?
I won't let that happen.
this is your office?
cool, huh?
Wi-Fi, hot chicks, and booze.
Mike, it's Sam.
Hey, listen, I have video on this computer.
can you hook us up?
not a problem.
where are you?
don't ask.
I need your help to open this file.
can you access it?
hello. It's me, Mike.
of course I can access it.
great, can you do it already?
Hey, Sam.
Hi, Vic.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk about what happened between us.
nothing happened between us.
and we're never talking about it.
is that Casey's little brother?
no, it's not.
can you please go away? Sam...
think you can sneak away for a while?
I think I've got everything under control.
I mean, it's not like it's the first time
Ed's left me in charge.
I thought maybe we could go someplace and talk.
just talk. Yeah.
I know just the place. Hmm.
you ever been out on Lake Las Vegas at night?
Nope.
well, I know a guy with a gondola.
this is Mary.
Hey, where are you? What's going on?
no, no...
what do you mean you can't tell me?
I'm extremely busy right now.
vic, we're not talking about it.
Sam, I'm in love with you.
what? What?!
Yeah, you heard me, Sam. I'm in love with you.
I've always been in love with you.
uh, Sam, there appears to be two separate encptions.
one to open up the file itself.
the only embedded inside the file.
can you open it?
I'm pretty sure I can get the first one open.
I'm not so certain about the second.
damn, I'm good.
Oh, my God!
you know what, Casey?
I don't know what I was thinking.
this is never gonna work.
are you here on business or pleasure, Mr. Traherne?
pleasure.
I can't believe how long it's taken us to realize that we can have this great sex with no romantic attachments.
I invited Derek Stephenson to spend a few days at the Montecito.
Derek, Delinda's old boyfriend from college?
so you like him? -Yeah.
we still gonna be able to, you know...once in a while?
I don't know.
Delinda and I are getting married.
am I doing the right thing, Danny?
I cann't answer that.
woody, I need a date to Delinda's wedding. -Delinda's wedding?
who is this?
you know who this is.
we got less than 20 hours to debrief you.
debrief me? I'm in the hotel business.
I want you. -Sarasvati?
I'm gonna explode.
ed, you don't just walk away from the Company.
watch me.
not here.
I'm sorry, mom.
I think I'm gonna throw up.
I'm serious.
Hey, Sam. Hi, Mary. Wow. Are you ready?
coming, honey.
what do you in here?
you're not supposed to be here.
I have to talk to...
code Red. Code Red. It's not drill. Repeat, this is not drill.
armed suspect, 50 West, shot fired.
Danny... I gotta go.
Danny, wait. Delinda?
Derek. I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
it's bad luck.
we need to talk.
one second.
I still can't believe Sarasvati exploded without me.
please, that girl exploded everywhere and with everyone.
what's that supped to mean?
she went out with the strippers last night.
all of them?
Yes, all of them.
code Red. Code Red. All security personnel.
armed suspect, 50 West, shot fired.
repeat, shot fired. Oh, God.
I hope it's not one of my clients.
code Red. All security personnel.
code Red.
sorry, ladies. Duty calls.
if we can just find the bride.
it's so typical of Delinda to be late for her own dding.
excuse me. Casey?
status.
Mr. Manning has been moved to safe location.
the gunman is in Mr. Deline's suite.
at least one shot has been fired.
is Ed in there with him?
Yes.
lock down the floor. And find Danny now.
lockdown 50 West.
talk to me, Mike.
the gunman is in Ed's suite with Ed.
at least one shot has been fired.
is he hit?
Mary? Hey.
where are Ed and Delinda?
is there something going on that I don't know about?
no, Delinda got cold feet, so she went to talk to Ed.
I can't get either of them on their cell phones.
something's wrong.
Oh, no.
you know Delinda.
I'm sure she just wants to make a big entrance.
you're probably right.
I know I'm right. Okay.
Uh...would you excuse me?
what's going on?
Derek, we need to talk.
okay...
what?
Jillian, there's, um...
just tell me.
okay, there's a man in Ed's suite.
he has a gun.
at least one shot was fired.
I want every elevator and stairwell secured.
is Delinda with Ed? Is she there?
I don't know.
Delinda, what's going on?
don't do it, Danny. Wait for the SWAT team.
SWAT team is on their way.
there's no time.
Hey, what's going on?
wait for the SWAT team, Danny!
drop the gun or I blow your head off.
drop it now.
let's move people. We gotta move on this.
let's go!
where is Delinda?
I don't know.
Derek, I think maybe we rushed into this.
Yeah.
and maybe we were living a little in the past and got swept up in the moment.
Yeah, and the whole Vegas atmosphere.
you know, that didn't help either, right?
exactly.
but I am still in love with you, Delinda.
I always have been and I always will be.
but, Derek...
Shh.
I let you get away once.
and I am not gonna let it happen again.
Mike, call Jillian and Delinda.
tell 'em we're on our way to the hospital.
tell 'em I'll meet 'em there.
Yeah, okay.
all right. Thank you.
okay, Danny is with Ed on their way to the hospital.
there's a car waiting to take you there.
where is Delinda?
Delinda's with Derek. Mike's on his way to get them.
just have 'em meet Jillian at the car?
meet Jillian at the car.
Mike, we're kind of in the middle of something.
Delinda, your father's been shot.
what?
Danny's with him. They're heading to the hospital.
Oh, my God.
come on, Ed. Don't go dying on me.
I can't find an entry wound.
are you sure he was shot?
they said one shot was fired.
there is bullet hole.
what the hell's in there?
what it is, it saved Deline's life.
lucky bastard.
what about the blood on his forehead?
that's a surface wound.
so maybe the bullet grazed him.
it's possible, but I think he may have had a heart attack.
how's my father?
he's... We're almost to the hospital.
Danny, how is he?
looks like the bullet missed, but he might have had a heart attack.
how is he?
they're almost to the hospital.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
we have an announcement to make.
the wedding will be postponed until further notice.
but please feel free to enjoy the gaming tables.
and the restaurants and the spa.
Deline's alive.
who the hell shot him?
wasn't me.
damn it.
run it to me, fellas.
male, 60s, unconscious at the scene.
contusion over the left forehead.
B. P. 150 over 60.
possible cardiac arrest.
prep Five, please, and get Dr. Fasberg down here, stat.
let everybody know we have Ed Deline's coming into the E. R.
come on, look up.
just give me one look.
Mike, this may not be appropriate given everything that's happening, but we have a card cheat on single deck blackjack.
had Aces and Jacks up his sleeves.
Danny caught one a couple of days ago.
this is the second one we've caught tonight.
looks like we might have a team.
shut down the single jack pit.
can't. They're full of high rollers, including two of Sam's clients.
call and Sam and tell her to meet me on the floor.
Sam, it's Shannon.
doctors don't know anything yet, but he's alive.
we need to see Ed Deline right away.
it's a matter of national security.
apparently the Montecito has a sleight of hand cheating team or there's a group of magicians in town practicing their card tricks.
I need to shut down the single deck blackjack pit.
that's not a good idea.
my high rollers aren't gonna like it.
in fact, they'll probably go to another casino.
Hey, any word on Ed?
nothing yet.
you guys haven't seen Casey, have you?
he just ran off with security without saying a word.
well, they took him to a safe location.
a safe location. Why?
any time anything like this happens,
Casey disappears.
he's paranoid of being kidnapped.
there's a lot of things about Casey you don't know.
Hey! Really?
this is Danny now. Hey.
Hey, it's me. The bullet missed.
but they think he may have had a heart attack.
a heart attack?
I'll call you guys back when I know more.
okay.
a heart attack? Uh...
Oh, that's great.
he probably found out Danny and Delinda were sleeping together again.
is that true?
Delinda and Danny? No! No, Mary, it's not true.
it's kind of rude of Casey just to run off like that without saying a word.
am I the only one who didn't know?
about Danny and Delinda?
well...you and Ed.
but please don't have a heart attack, Mary.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
I wanted to tell you, but Sam wouldn't let me.
what are you talking about?
I'm the only one who wanted to tell her.
that's not true!
I'm so, so sorry about your wedding.
I'll be right back.
I'm sure Ed's gonna be fine.
we'll just...
we'll have the wedding in a couple of days.
you think she was serious when she said she was never speaking to us again?
Yeah, I think she was. This is Sam.
no, I won't hold. No, I don't hold.
we just caught two more players with cards up their sleeves.
maybe Ed's shooting was a diversion.
have Mitch call Metro and get an ID on the gunman.
Yes, it's me. What...
Uh-huh. What?!
what do you mean he won't leave the villa?
how much?!
well, why didn't you tell me this three weeks ago?
uh, are you insane?
what in the world would make you think that I would want to comp him half a million dollars worth of services?
well, you thought wrong.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. What's your name again?
one, you're a dumb-ass.
and two, this conversation is over.
you're fired.
can I see the chart, please?
what's going on?
I've been trying to tell everyone.
I...
are you in love with Danny?
Oh, Delinda.
take him to holding.
Mike, listen, I have a problem.
you see Woody?
woody's here?
Yeah, he's looking all over for you.
he said you invited him to the wedding.
Yeah, I did.
well, forget about Woody. Listen, I have a problem.
one of my whales refuses to leave the Montecito's Hawaiian Villas.
he's been camped out for a month.
running up an extensive bill.
caviar, champagne, local strippers.
the Hawaiian Villas?
Yeah. I heard they're nice.
not that I'd know.
I haven't been down there personally, but first chance I get I'm going surfing.
fascinating.
we're talking about my problem right now.
right, sorry. He refuses to leave unless I personally present myself at his villa.
he's also under the false impression that the Montecito is gonna be picking up the tab for month-long visit and unique taste.
Oh, you're right. You do have a problem since you're personally responsible for your clients and their bills.
Oh, so you're not helping.
well, I'm just telling you like it...
I have a business problem and you're not interested...
this is Mike.
he's gonna be okay.
that's great news, Delinda. That's great news.
ed is going to be okay.
good, 'cause I have to go to Hawaii.
when? Now.
what about Woody?
tell Woody that I'll be back by tomorrow night at the latest.
have Mary watch my clients, but if there's any problems, you call me.
and I'm taking the jet.
we're still waiting on the blood work to know if he had a heart attack, but he's had a major concussion.
we'll just be a minute.
Oh, God.
I thought I'd died and gone to hell.
ed, we had nothing to do with the shooting.
all we wanted to do was get you back to Langley for the debriefing on Karim Sharif.
you're giving me a very large headache.
the company is sending a team after him.
waste of time.
I don't know what you did, or what you think you did 20 years ago, but Karim Sharif is very much alive.
Hmph.
now where do we find him?
six feet under.
all right, that'll be all, fellas.
visiting hours are over.
what's going on? Those friends?
how you doing, pal?
I'm not the one getting shot at.
you okay?
I guess I hit my head when I caught that table I was trying to dive under.
apparently I'm not as quick as I used to be.
Ed? Hey, sweetie.
Oh! Are you okay?
they said you had a heart attack.
me? A heart attack?
first of all, you have to own one of those in order for that to happen.
no, I didn't have no heart attack.
I hit my head, that's all.
I'm really sorry about the wedding.
I'm so sorry.
there's not gonna be wedding, Daddy.
where is he? The wine cellar.
maybe you can talk some sense into him.
well, I'll try.
Derek go back to Myanmar?
I don't know.
he's a little upset about this whole thing.
you want me to talk to him?
I don't think that's such a good idea.
okay.
Hey.
Mmm. What's...
Thanks.
for what?
for feeling the same way about me that I feel about you.
you do feel the same way about me, don't you?
Yes.
Oh.
don't screw this up, Delinda.
I won't.
what's hell wrong with you? Would you slow down a little bit?
I feel a little bit sick.
Where'd you learn to drive, Samoa?
Aloha. Welcome to Hawaii.
Aloha, my ass.
who puts a hotel in the middle of a jungle?
Where's your manager? Great.
Oh, crap.
what's going on?
I've got some business to take care of.
yeah? What kind of business?
I'll be leaving town for a little while.
if anybody should ask...
just tell 'em I'm at the house recuperating.
naturally, while I'm gone, you'll be in charge.
you're going after Sharif, aren't you?
I just can't believe.
I didn't know how Delinda felt about Danny.
I didn't know either. You didn't know?
Hey, Mary. Hey, Derek.
Hey, come on, Mary.
how long is this not speaking to me treatment gonna go on?
so is there anything else you need?
guess I could use a ride to the airport.
of course, we can take care of that for you.
now if you're excuse me,
I think that Jewel and her band are just checking in for the show tonight.
thanks for everything.
tell Jewel I said... Come on, Mary!
look, no offense, but do you think maybe when you hit your head you might have had the sense knocked out of you?
Danny, believe me.
I really don't want to be doing this.
well, then why are you?
the truth is the CIA wouldn't be going through all this trouble on some 20-year-old operation unless ihad some validity today.
then why not just go to Langley?
for one, I don't trust them.
and two...
if what they're saying is true, it's my mess.
you know? So...
the best thing I can do right now.
the Company already cost me one of my daughters.
just because you leave doesn't mean that Jillian and Delinda are gonna be safe.
if I move, they'll follow.
okay, then let me help you.
let me go with you.
I appreciate that, pal.
but no, thanks.
look, if something should happen, you're the only one I trust with the family.
answer your phone. It's just Sam.
come on, answer the phone, answer the phone.
come on, answer your phone.
answer the phone.
she's in the middle of a big problem right now.
one of her whales racked up a half million dollars in charges and they're trying to stick the Montecito with it.
I want you to think about what you're doing.
take care of Delinda, huh?
I'll see you, buddy.
yeah?
listen, just out of curiosity, why aren't you answering your phone
I just did.
okay, I'd like you to get on an airplane and come here right now.
I'm a little busy right now.
listen to me. You don't seem to understand.
Casey's little brother is the manager here.
I know.
don't you read the memos he sends out?
why would I read a memo from Casey?
because then you would know his little brother's the manager there.
get your ass on an airplane and come here right now, please.
what have you got against Casey's little brother, Sam?
nothing!
sounds like a little more than nothing to...
Hello?
son of a...
Hello, Sam.
it's been a long time.
Hi, Vic.
he's gone.
what's this?
my dad's wedding present to me.
a metal house?
sterling silver.
daddy was going to build Derek and I a house as a wedding present.
right next to his, of course.
of course.
Mary, this is ridiculous.
it wasn't my place to tell you.
Mary, please?
pretty please.
this is Mike.
Mike, it's Shannon. You better get up here ASAP.
someone's tapped into the surveillance feed.
they're seeing everything we are.
what kind of an idiot lets a guest rack up a half million dollar bill?
Casey has very specific orders concerning you and your clients.
Yeah, I'll bet. What are they?
whatever Sam wants, Sam gets.
Really?
it still doesn't explain what kind of an idiot would let a guest rack up a bill for half a million dollars.
he's youclient, Sam.
he said you okayed everything.
you're an idiot just like your brother.
Oh, why you gotta be so mean?
it's my nature.
Brian, open up! It's Sam!
open the damn door! It's Samantha Marquez.
what do we got?
some kind of tap in the system.
any idea where it's coming from?
external, and very sophisticated.
I got Metro's footage of the gunman's confession.
streamlining it now.
ten grand and he just takes it from me.
get Danny on the phone.
I told Deline I was gonna get him for what he did.
nobody cheats Barry Berona.
nobody!
I don't suppose you tried your passkey.
give it to me.
unbelievable. Idiot.
you still can't be mad at me because of what happened between us?
nothing happened between us.
Hey, Sam.
Brian, what the hell is wrong with you?
do you have any idea how...
what is that smell?
Oh, my God. Please don't tell me...
I didn't kill her.
I guess now we know why he wouldn't open the door.
chicken?
okay, so you guys are like Hawaii Five-O, right?
you ever say, "Book 'em, Danno"?
ms. Marquez, we're trying to find out how long the body's been here and exactly what happened.
I don't know about any of that 'cause I just got here.
the only thing your client, our suspect, will say is, "Talk to Sam.
and you're Sam.
Yes, I am Sam, but...
your client told us that you provided him with the stripper.
okay, hold on.
I didn't provide anybody with a stripper.
I'm just the man's casino host.
and everyone knows that Las Vegas casino hosts provide their clients with anything they ask for.
well, that's... that is true.
but, uh...
you know what? I'm sorry.
I think I need to speak to my attorney before I answer any more questions.
so I'm just gonna make a quick phone call, all right?
Aloha.
you must be...tsss! Sam.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
your client's attorney.
you're an attorney?
well, attorney slash private eye.
no, no, dude, you don't have a law degree.
he doesn't have a law degree, right?
actually, I got my law degree online between sets of waves.
took a dozen or so years...
ahem...longer than originally planned.
this is perfect.
this is just what I need.
another idiot. Hold on.
this is Sam.
Sam, it's Mary.
I'm only speaking with you because I'm a professional and this conversation is work related.
that's great, Mary.
listen, I need to ask you something.
why didn't anybody tell me that Casey made his little brother manager of the Hawaiian Villas?
maybe you should've read Casey's memos.
okay, forget that. Listen, I have a problem.
Hey, Mar.
Sam has a problem.
Hello? Hello?
Hey, Sam, just ran into Woody in the lobby.
didn't know you had to go all the way to Boston to get a date. He's pissed.
you should probably call him before he gets on the plane.
Where's he going?
back to Boston. Why?
I don't know. He didn't say.
you know, don't you?
last one to know everything.
I wanted to tell you.
but then Derek showed up and then things just got out of hand.
got out of hand?
is that how you explain what's been going on?
I'm sorry. Delinda, I don't want to talk about this.
why didn't you tell me that Casey made his little brother manager of the Montecito?
would you slow down? You sound like a chipmunk.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
two of Sam's clients want credit extensions.
Davidson, one million. Perry, two.
okay, Davidson wants a credit extension.
one million. Perry, two.
okay, listen to me.
give Davidson 750 grand.
hold on Perry till you find out how many markers he has out around town.
he may be extended at more than one casino.
sorry, do you mind?
give Davidson 750. Hold on Perry.
Yes.
Mary, wait.
Hello?
what's the problem?
okay, first of all, Casey's little brother is an idiot.
I don't know if you're aware of this or not.
and apparently so is my whale, who's racked up half a million dollars and put it on my account.
and I just walked in and found him with a dead stripper in his bed.
whoa, back up.
you said they found a dead stripper in his bed?
Yes, why do you think we're having this conversation?
there is a stripper, and she's dead.
maybe the tap has something to do with the card cheaters.
hmm, it's too sophisticated for them.
they do remind me of a bunch of frat boys.
I'll check a see if any fraternities or college groups checked in.
Yeah.
Oh, this doesn't look good.
cat fight.
Where's the Hawaiian Villas Head of Security?
I...don't think he's gonna be much help.
hold on, I got another call.
No...do not put me on hold! Danny, do not put me on hold!
yeah?
Hey, just a heads up.
Mary and Delinda just got into a heated discussion.
Delinda's in tears, and Mary's...
heading right for you.
Hey.
how could you do this to me?
how could I do what?
you made me look like an idiot.
look, Mary, The Delines are like family...okay!
and what am I?
okay.
why don't we get back to that tap?
you know what I mean, Mary.
no, Danny, I have no idea what you mean.
maybe you can explain it to me.
since my father died, they became like family.
ms. Marquez, please hang up the phone.
just shut up for one second.
ms. Marquez, hang up that phone or you'll be arrested.
okay, well, go ahead and arrest me, but just keep it down, okay?
because you will not believe this...
so they're your family. Yeah.
I got news for you, Danny McCoy.
you're the only family I ever had.
that's not what...
that went well.
Thanks.
I was just kidding.
you're not in Las Vegas anymore, Ms. Marquez.
we take murder very seriously in the islands.
Yeah, but can't you guys take a joke around here?
how you doing today?
how'd it go with Mary?
not well.
you should've told her.
she's not talking to me.
I can't deal with the cold shoulder, man.
not from Mary.
so where are you with the tap situation?
can't identify the source.
this has CIA written all over it.
Seriously?
Yeah.
do you think Ed is in some kind of trouble?
I don't know.
so, you know any more about the card cheats?
uh, yeah, looks like a bunch of frat boys in town trying their version of the MIT card cheating scam.
shut down the single deck 21 pit until we can account for all of them.
Sam's whales will walk if we shut down the pit.
set up a table with a few incentives.
great idea.
I'll see if I can shut down this tap.
Oh!
you two make a cute couple.
Thanks.
what's that?
it was mailed to me with your name on it.
I think it has something to do with your whale.
could you excuse me for just a minute?
okay, thanks.
just give me...
you've gotta get me out of there.
we can't shut down the tap without shutting down our entire system, which would leave the Montecito completely blind.
is there a way we can get into their server?
hmm.
you mean send a virus or a Trojan horse?
Yeah.
the CIA's computers. Right.
Yeah, that's not a bad... Wait a minute.
I think they call that treason, Danny, which when last I checked is punishable by death.
no, thanks. I'll pass. I got it.
remember that spammer that flooded the Montecito's computer system with all that... Spam, yeah.
right, do we still have all those files of spam kept as evidence?
we'll flood their feed with spam.
they're already in our system.
and if they, you know, sort of accidentally hit those evidence files, I mean...
about 200 million messages will download.
and even their server wouldn't be able to handle it.
so you think you can help their tap find our spam files?
so how'd you get me out so quick?
you just have to know the Hawaiian way.
where we headed?
my office.
your office is on the beach.
Yep! Of course.
listen...
uh, excuse me.
do you have any idea what's on the flash drive?
I have no idea.
it's encrypted.
I thought maybe you'd know.
that's great.
well, I don't, but I do know someone who can help us.
do you surf?
do I look like I surf?
well, you do have a very nice low center of gravity.
it's been a few years since we've seen you, Mr. Locken.
Yeah, I've been busy.
thank you.
and why exactly is this a Montecito problem, Sam?
because it's gonna be a problem with everything.
bad P. R. bad everything.
sounds to me like this is a "Sam problem." Yeah.
Ugh! Okay.
please.
what?
please.
what? Please.
okay, fine.
we'll help.
only because I can't stand to hear you beg.
I don't know what happened, but the tap disappeared.
Hey! Hmm!
later.
Derek, I'm so sorry.
so am I.
Delinda, we would've been good together.
you okay?
Yeah.
it's just been a wild last few days.
Yeah, I noticed.
Mary's pissed at me.
me too.
now what?
let's see what happens.
what if I screw it up again?
I won't let that happen.
this is your office?
cool, huh?
Wi-Fi, hot chicks, and booze.
Mike, it's Sam.
Hey, listen, I have video on this computer.
can you hook us up?
not a problem.
where are you?
don't ask.
I need your help to open this file.
can you access it?
hello. It's me, Mike.
of course I can access it.
great, can you do it already?
Hey, Sam.
Hi, Vic.
what are you doing here?
we need to talk about what happened between us.
nothing happened between us.
and we're never lking about it.
is that Casey's little brother?
no, it's not.
can you please go away? Sam...
think you can sneak away for a while?
I think I've got everything under control.
I mean, it's not like it's the first time.
Ed's left me in charge.
I thought maybe we could go someplace and talk.
just talk. Yeah.
I know just the place. Hmm.
you ever been out on Lake Las Vegas at night?
Nope.
well, I know a guy with a gondola.
this is Mary.
Hey, where are you? What's going on?
no, no...
what do you mean you can't tell me?
I'm extremely busy right now.
vic, we're not talking about it.
Sam, I'm in love with you.
what? What?!
Yeah, you heard me, Sam. I'm in love with you.
I've always been in love with you.
uh, Sam, there appears to be two separate encptions.
one to open up the file itself.
the only embedded inside the file.
can you open it?
I'm pretty sure I can get the first one open.
I'm not so certain about the second.
damn, I'm good.
Oh, my God!
you know what, Casey?
I don't know what I was thinking.
this is never gonna work.
are you here on business or pleasure, Mr. Traherne?
pleasure.
okay.
who the hell are you?
call me Mr. Chips.
it's Tips. Mr. Tips, jack-off.
I've got the gun.
I'm whoever I want to be.
what do you want?
well, I had the silly idea of combining my two favorite things.
and what's that? Gay sex, suicide?
that one hurt, huh?
no more in the face.
no, I was thinking more like kidnapping and robbery.
yeah?
well, you might as well kill me then 'cause, uh, you're not gonna make a dime on me.
that's quite a bit of bravado, Mr. Deline.
but I have no intention of killing you.
Oh, that's funny, 'cause I have every intention of killing you.
I do, however, have no problem at all killing your daughter.
daddy! -Delinda.
you're dead!
you're dead!
daddy, help me!
it's all right, honey, I'm here.
death of a daughter is like a needle to the heart, ain't it?
daddy! You're gonna wish that you were never born.
that was just like out of a movie.
goosebumps.
daddy!
daddy!
as you've now come to understand, Ed, this sandy grave was not prepared for you, but rather, for your daughter.
and by the way...
Delinda Deline? Ridiculous name.
ridiculous.
what do you want?
what do I want? I want world peace.
I want fair elections.
penis reduction.
but I'd settle for you stealing $50 million from the casino for me.
No! No!
daddy! Let her go, and I'll help you.
rob your casino, or she dies.
what do you say, Ed?
daddy!
No!
No!
No!
this'll be okay, honey.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
daddy!
daddy!
you don't have to put her in a box do ya?
daddy!
son of a bitch. So brave.
now, Ed, your daughter's gonna have to calm down, or it's gonna end very badly for her.
honey, you're gonna have to stop fightin'.
daddy, help me.
honey, just do what they say, all right?
you have 12 hours to steal $50 million in consequential bills from the Montecito.
that's not enough time.
well, it has to be.
see, that's the exact amount of air
I'm putting in the casket for your daughter to breathe.
daddy, please.
I know. Nice touch, right?
now, the money cannot be traceable.
so if any dye packs or electronic devices are detected on the money,
Delinda will die.
understood.
for your daughter's security, and for that matter, mine, you may not tell anyone what you're doing.
you'll be watched and monitored at all times.
what do I tell my people?
a bedtime story?
one word about any of this, and Delinda dies.
seriously, did you choose her name, or did your wife?
why don't you go to hell?
in time, Ed.
in time.
now, your ankle-- that has a GPS monitor in it.
and also, an audio transmitter that will relay any and all conversations you have.
it's also packed with enough high-density C-4 to blow your legs clear off your body.
if, at any time, you fail to comply with our plans, the explosives will be detonated, and your daughter killed.
are we clear?
Yeah.
good.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
it's gonna be all right, honey. No!
No! No!
daddy! Daddy!
daddy! No!
No! No!
daddy! [muffled]
nor but in merriment begin a chase, Nor but in merriment a quarrel.
o may she live like some green laurel Rooted in one dear perpetual place.
that's from Yeats.
apropos, don't you think?
I swear on my mother...
somehow, I will kill you.
Ah!
daddy!
any questions?
when do I get my daughter back?
after I get my money you'll be given the location of this grave and the code to disarm the explosives on the coffin.
in the coffin, you'll find a key that will unlock your electronic anklet.
daddy!
okay, she's in. Please somebody help me!
now all we need is someone to...
bury her.
you better kill us both.
Oh, I'd like to.
but I need ya.
bury her.
throw him in the truck.
Dadddy, please!
please, somebody help me!
nice shirt.
it was a gift.
give it back.
you must love her very much. Who?
whoever bought you that shirt.
Hi, it's Delinda.
leave a message.
Hey, hey, Delinda, it's me.
where are you? Call me.
Danny-- -Hey.
uh, have you seen Delinda?
what? Have you seen Delinda?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over that shirt.
no, seriously, it looks like a donkey and a rodeo clown met a shotgun.
dude, Delinda gave it to me.
yo, she gotta be crazy freaky in bed.
this is not necessary. Sorry.
I'm a little worried about her.
I woke up this morning, and she wasn't there.
she worked the late shift last night, right?
maybe she went to workout afterwards.
no, she would've called.
Yeah, she would've called.
I'll look around for her. All right.
wanna hit that buffet?
Mr. Turner, Mr. Hammond.
welcome to the Montecito.
I'm Sam, your casino host.
call me Sid. Sid.
Yes, Willie Hammond. Hi, Willie.
millionaire.
okay...
uh, listen, seeing as this is your first visit to the Montecito, we just need to verify some account information with your respective banks.
it's pretty common practice.
we've brought cash. Cash.
cash-- $2 million each.
$2 million...
each.
okay, well, we will hold that cash here at our casino cage, and credit your accounts accordingly.
all right.
what type of business are you two in?
we're not in any business at all!
no, no, no, there's no business.
uh, we won the Pennsylvania state lottery.
Yeah, me and Willie here split 20 bucks on some tickets, split 20 bucks on some tickets, and we won the whole damn thing.
Oh-- $43. 7 million.
Ah!
that is dancing.
Oh, snap!
this is gonna be a long weekend.
beg your pardon?
I said this is gonna be an amazing weekend!
Yeah!
I've arranged for two of the Montecito's finest suites for your stay.
Oh, great. We're gonna need two rooms together.
Yeah, right next to each other.
okay, well, I-- Yeah, you need to make that happen, or else we're leavin'.
with our cash.
next to each other it is.
Hey, Ed.
so, uh, what...
you look awful.
nice to see you too.
what happened?
Oh, um...
I fell down at the house.
no big deal. I'm fine.
what do you think?
go ahead, take a shot.
it's nice.
it's nice? You don't.
you don't think it's a little much?
what the hell do I know about shirts, you know?
look, I've got a really busy day today, so I need you to hold down the floor, okay?
okay. All right.
okay, uh, have you seen Delinda?
she didn't come home last night, and she's not answering her cell phone.
I forgot to tell you that she's.
she's with her sister.
Nessa's here in town?
do I stutter?
don't worry about it.
Delinda's gonna call you later, all right?
well, I haven't seen Nessa in forever.
Yeah, I know. Where are they?
Yeah, uh, listen-- Do me a favor.
I don't want to be bothered, okay?
Hey, boss, how you doin'?
Hey, uh, it's not a good time now.
Yeah, well, it never seems to be a good time to tell you what I'm thinking, so I'm just gonna go for it.
ed, I need to be more integral in the hotel's development and operations.
right.
now, with that in mind, I have a plan to boost the profile of the Montecito while improving our customer relations.
okay. The Montecito needs a mascot.
right.
you see, uh, a popular mascot can be a source or corporate identity.
and, you know, statistics.
they--they bare out everything that I'm saying to you.
restaurants that introduce mascots increase food and beverage sales as much as 17%.
so... That sounds great.
Really?
you like my idea?
I do. Yeah, just go for it.
thank you, Ed. Okay.
you won't be sorry.
six please.
you really think this place needs a mascot?
ten hours and counting, Eddie.
temper, temper, Eddie!
you might want to remind yourself what this is all about.
a pity, isn't it?
so far, you've done a good job keeping the security counterparts and throwing 'em off the trail.
stay focused, Eddie.
this is me.
this'll be over soon.
remember, Eddie, we're watchin'.
always watchin'.
Hi, Danny.
the good news about Nessa, huh?
what are you talking about?
well, Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.
why would Ed tell you that?
so she's not in town?
Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.
Yeah, of course you would.
you know what? Maybe I just misunderstood.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah...
you haven't spoken to Delinda today, have you?
no, I got her machine this morning.
are you two fighting?
no. No, no.
not that I know of, anyway.
I--I just...
she's not answering her cell phone, so...
she's probably just lost it again.
okay!
thank you...
honey, I'm sure she's fine, but, uh, when you talk to her, let me know, okay?
and I'll do the same.
okay.
Hey.
uh, how much you holdin' here on the floor?
give me a second.
$18 million.
Thanks.
$16 million.
$6 mil.
Thanks.
nine.
six.
15
this is Ed Deline at the Montecito.
customer number 890087.
Yeah, I need an additional $25 million delivered to the casino.
would you tell John it's for me?
and I need it rushed. Um...
two hours?
you're ordering more money?
we just got our delivery.
I got a couple whales comin' in.
million dollar players.
sorry?
Yeah, thank you.
are you sure we need that?
no, I'm not sure, that's why I ordered it.
what is this, second guess Saturday?
okay, here's an idea for ya.
don't spread yourself too thin, all right?
doin' both our jobs. Sorry.
okay, I was just-- What?
Leavin'?
no.
no, I--I want to know why you lied to me about Nessa.
what, are you checking up on me?
I talked to Jillian. You don't check up on me!
I am worried about Delinda, okay?
well, so am I.
be very careful here, Ed.
now, get rid of him, and get me my money.
right.
they want you on the floor.
you need anything, just...
I know.
I really need you to leave now.
Hey, Sam, these rooms are great.
I am so glad you like them.
now listen--If there is anything I can do to make your stay more enjoyable, you don't hesitate to ask, all right?
Hey, now, the whole hotel is open to us?
Yeah, of course.
high stakes parlor is located on the main casino floor.
now, I'm-- Hey.
we can't gamble, though, until the game is finished.
what game? Hide and seek.
when you say hide and seek, you don't mean...
Yeah. Yeah, like the kids game.
hide and seek. Why--Why would you play that?
for money.
Yeah, we put up a million each.
you're playing hide and seek for $2 million?
exactly. And the game starts now.
we're run for 12 hours?
right. Synchronize watches.
ready? Yes.
ready? Yeah.
one, two, three.
scissors cut paper.
you're it!
you guys are gonna gamble, right?
three-- Yeah, don't worry about it.
30! You don't gamble, I can't extend the Montecito's hospitality to you.
uh, why are your whales running?
uh, because they can't swim.
they're playing hide and seek.
right. Mm.
uh, how much are they gonna play for over the weekend?
couple million each.
do you have any other high rollers coming in?
no, just Orville and Wilbur. Why?
because Ed orders an extra $25 million to accommodate a guest.
you know anything about that?
no, I don't know anything about that.
okay, keep an eye on 'em.
[under breath] Oh, this is gonna suck.
Danny said you told him that Delinda's with Nessa.
no.
where is Delinda, Ed? She told me, uh, she went to that spa at Red Rocks.
uh, I guess Danny and her had some kind of fight and, uh, she wanted some, uh, what do they call it now?
private time. Should I go meet her?
no, she'll be fine.
why didn't she call me?
how should I know?
I mean, she told you, but she didn't tell me, and then.
and why would Danny say that you said that?
again, honey, how should I know? And, um...
I really think that we should stay out of their personal lives.
this doesn't make any sense. Why would.
Jillian, please.
fine.
having a bad day?
I, um, I got a lot of stuff going on.
you'd tell me if something was wrong, wouldn't you?
of course I would.
I'll see you at home tonight.
honey?
I love you.
I love you too.
would you excuse us a minute please?
Thanks.
Tommy, listen, um...
I need you to pack $25 million cash for transport, a'right?
$25 million. Yeah.
for what?
what do you mean, for what?
when do you need it? I need it right now.
ed, you know I can't do that.
pull that kind of cash off the floor,
I gotta close down half the casino.
close down half the casino.
we'll lose millions if I do that.
listen, this isn't a frickin' debate, Tommy.
just do what I tell ya. All right?
now, listen-- I want the money bound.
I want it wrapped in plastic and put on pallets.
I need two signatures to make it-- I'll sign twice.
you know, I can't do it.
I'll lose my job.
Yeah, you're right, Tom.
Hey, Bill.
Yes, sir?
you just got promoted.
you're new cage manager.
Ed-- You're fired, Tommy. Get out.
come on, Ed. I said get out.
get out!
you, uh, heard? You understood my request?
Yes, sir.
$25 million right away, Mr. Deline.
you ready? As I'll ever be.
all right, Mike, I present to you the Montecito's new mascot.
I don't get it.
he's a prospector.
I can see that.
so?
so what does prospecting have to do with the Montecito?
he will help you "mine" your fortunes from our casino.
I still don't get it.
research has shown us that people wanna see more 49er-style prospectors in their casinos.
research?
the man in a suit has done stints as Mayor McCheese, a Teletubby, and a brief tour as Barney Rubble.
I couldn't be more excited.
and you're sure you've cleared this with Ed.
Yeah, he told me to go for it.
so I say we let Monty Montecito show people just how much fun this hotel can be.
the Montecito has a mascot.
I see that.
I don't get the whole prospector thing.
not so much.
do you know that Ed just fired Tommy, the cage manager?
Tommy? He's been with Ed forever.
he'd never do that. He just did.
I just talked to Tommy.
he said that he questioned him about taking 25 million bucks off the floor.
but I saw a security manifest sent from the bank.
ed just ordered an additional $25 million to be brought in.
what the hell's going on, Mike?
like that damn mascot?
it's not making any sense.
no, we need to find out what Ed's gonna do with 50 million bucks.
Mitch, pull up surveillance footage of Ed today, will you?
you got it.
Thanks.
who the hell is that?
what's he showin' him?
zoom in.
can't, it's blowing out.
something is seriously wrong.
okay, I think that this has something to do with Delinda because he told me that she's with Nessa.
nessa? Yeah.
but she's-- I know.
I think that it was Ed's way of tippin' me off.
uh, Mitch, video IQ the guy in the elevator, will you?
there's no matches.
want me to try some other database?
Yeah, keep working on it.
show me some surveillance footage of, uh, Delinda.
Delinda. Yeah.
What--This guy keeps poppin' up.
see this?
Yeah. Look at that.
here.
let's go here.
then again right there.
Hey, show me the entrance from shift change.
okay, she's alone.
there he is again.
Hey, Mitch, video IQ this guy, will you?
here we go.
Oh, he's got a record for felony assault.
what the hell's she doing?
she getting in the car.
could have a gun.
no license plate.
where the hell is she?
Hey!
Hey! Hi, Sam!
Hi, what the hell are ya doin'?
what?
I said what the hell ya doin'?
he's in the shower.
okay, listen, I need to know when you and Willie plan on gambling.
soon, real soon.
Listen--This is-- This is.
I'll pay for it.
no. Uh-uh.
uh.
okay, I'm sorry.
I can't...
N-n-n-no.
n-n-no. Listen to me.
Hey! Hey, come here!
can I have my shoe back?
you gonna gamble? Yes, ma'am.
thank you. He's naked.
Oh, hey, Sam.
which way did he go?
Thatta way.
put some clothes on.
took you long enough.
it's been three minutes.
and why in the hell would you want to meet in here?
you know brothers can't stand the cold.
they're out there.
who? I don't know.
whoever it is that's watching Ed.
they're--they're tracking his movements, who he's interacting with.
he lied to me.
he tried to take 50 million bucks off the floor.
and where the hell is Delinda?
kidnappers.
so what do we do?
we help him.
Hey, he grabbed my ass!
all the money's coming in.
everything's pretty much business as usual.
great.
Oh, I almost forgot that, uh, about that problem in the casino's southeast bathroom?
the problem was in one of the stalls.
it's been fixed, I know you wanted to check it out.
so... Yeah.
when I get a chance.
okay, I'm going back to the floor.
um...
I just wanna say thanks, kid.
no problem.
Hey, Sid-- Hi, we need to talk.
uh, in a minute, okay?
so, anyway, we're at the high rollers suite.
you should come up for a drink.
Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah, and maybe if you had a friend, you know, you could bring her along.
and who knows.
wait a...
wow, it's pretty cold in there, huh? Hey, sweetie.
Hi. How ya doin'?
I wish I was dead.
Yeah, I can see why. Yeah.
you see the mascot I brought in?
no, and I have no desire to see the mascot.
tough, come with me.
no, I don't-- I'm not kidding.
I don't care.
I don't get it.
he's a prospector.
looks like he struck something.
Hey! Hey, stop!
stop that!
I lost my pants. [laughs]
I got it. I got it under control.
I'm having a GPS tracking device put under the firewall, detectable only if the bad guys find our frequency.
the helicopters are ready to go on your order.
okay.
okay, good.
I want you to, uh, over see hotel security and be the liaison between the FBI once we get Delinda back, okay?
and you are gonna get her back.
you bet your ass.
I was asked to deliver this personally to you, Mr. Deline.
thank you.
Hello, Ed, nice of you to call.
I can do without the pleasantries.
when the money arrives, you will drive it towards Henderson.
alone.
you'll receive further instructions on this cell phone.
any deviation from this plan will be noncompliance, and your daughter dies.
understood?
Yeah, understood.
look forward to seein' ya, Ed.
you have no idea.
notify Mr. Deline and send guards out to the truck.
okay.
$25 million just arrived at the loading dock.
okay, let's pull the other $25 million off the floor.
let's close down half the gaming tables, the north and south slot areas, and all the high roller pits. Let's do it.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop.
what's up, Sam?
I've had enough.
you had-- That's what's up, okay?
you need to either gamble or I'm throwing you out.
Wh--Why didn't you say something?
I'll get my gamble on.
uh, say it. Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry, excuse me.

you really should have golf carts.
you should really have a heart attack.
I need you to shut down blackjack tables 18 through 51.
does Mr. Deline know about this?
Yes. Per his orders.
now, now. Okay.
all right, let's move out.
Mr. Deline.
yeah? I don't have to tell you that this is breaking security protocol.
listen, I'll indemnify you.

all right, load the money in the truck, will ya?
Yes, sir.
load it up, guys.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

okay, thanks.
the helicopter's waiting for you on the roof.
Thanks. Let me know the second you get Delinda back and I'll make the call.
nothing until I tell you she's safe.
you got it.
let's go!
all right, keep your distance.
Roger that.
you're fired.
cause you're drunk.
Yes.
and you were also fondling guests.
we have a dozen complaints against you.
sorry, Monty, but...
we're gonna have to let you go.
I'm sorry.
get up. No, no, no.
come on, come one, come on.
you're outta here, pal. You're outta here. Come on.
Oh, I guess I gotta whip some foam ass.
and stay out, ya foam lowlife!
n-n-no, no.
nicely handled.
you know, it's sad when a mascot loses his way.
15 more seconds and I win $1 million.
and then you will gamble? Absolutely.
ten, nine, eight, seven...
who the hell are you?
four, three, two.
Hey, who the hell is that guy?
I won! A million dollars, baby!
thanks for the suit, Sam.
no problem.
Hey--credit my account.
No! This is a do-over!
what? I'm not paying you.
we said nothing about costumes!
what? It's not the point!
I would've been a big chipmunk!
you know that.
no, you always do that. I love to dress up!
do-over! It's a do-over!
you're sad! You're million...
you cheap millionaire.
get out of the truck.
hands where I can see 'em.
money's in the truck.
all right, check the money for dye packs, transmitters, the number sequences on the bills.
where is my daughter?
patience, Eddie. Patience.
no patience, pal.
right now, where is she?
now.
the money's clean.
okay, move it to the trucks.
let's go.
there's your daughter.
now time is running out, so if I were you, I would hurry.
come on, guys. Let's go.
come on! Step it up!
Oh, hey, Chips...
you want me to kill him?
no, no.
no, that'll happen soon enough.
take the keys out of his truck.
let's go! Finish up!
Ed-- Good punch.
enjoy your walk.
let's go!
Danny, listen.
Delinda's buried.
did you just say Delinda's buried?
Yeah.
where?
the coordinates are north West, 115, 09.
okay, got it.
when you get there, dig up the box, but do not open it.
it's rigged with explosives.
I'll give you the combination.
okay.
okay, all right. We're on our way.
Oh, that ain't good.
okay, we're here.
there it is! Right here!
right here!
right here. Dig!
come on.
okay.
give me the combination.
combination is.
come on.
ed, she's not here!
Delinda's not here!
son of a bitch.
I'm not gonna make it, kid.
you gotta find Delinda and bring her back.
What're you talking about?
there's no time.
just promise me you'll find her.
promise me.
ed, listen to me!
listen to.
I'll see ya, kid.
talk to me Ed.
your father is dead.
how would like to be my co-partner in the Montecito?
why wouldn't I just wait a week until the IRS seizes this place, and then I can buy it in private auction?
don't move, bitch.
I can't shake him, my father.
I told you if you ever came near her again,
I would kill you.
there's only one way I'll ever feel safe from him.
you okay? I called you!
where were you?
Mary needed to talk. You were with Mary?
she needed me to-- I needed you.
I don't want her going back to that condo.
honey, look, I got security wiring that joint tomorrow like it was Fort Knox.
I'd do anything for you, Sam.
what if what I wanted was big?
I think I just bought you a hotel.
had a little chat with your dad.
you have total surveillance access to the whole place.
how'd it go? He said he's gonna back off.
What'd you put in there?
that son of a bitch.
I told you to stay out of our lives.
have you seen Sam?
not since last night. You try her cell?
she's not answering.
something I can help you with?
ed needs to talk to her.
she was working with at least half a dozen
they had her running all over the place.
she could be anywhere.
apparently trying to round up financial backing to bail out the Montecito.
so the rumors are true?
Ed's got it under control.
excuse me, Mike.
Mary, have you seen Sam?
no.
but I haven't really been looking for her either.
guess you're off the clock.
no, just a little late lunch.
Cheers.
have you guys seen Danny? He didn't come home last night.
not since he punched out your father.
Danny punched Daddy?
right in the middle of the lobby.
Oh, my God.
you haven't seen Sam, have you?
Sam? No.
if either of you run into her, tell her Ed needs to see her ASAP.
he's looking for her.
you don't look so good.
stomach flu.
are you drinking on the job?
no.
I am drinking... on my lunch break.
excuse me.
what's going on?
can't a girl get a drink?
Delinda. Danny just came in.
Delinda, look, I'm sorry that I hit your dad, okay?
but he deserved it. Danny
lieutenant McCoy.
this is the guy that I told you about that saved my life.
what's going on? Danny.
I ain't goin' back to the war, Lieutenant.
three tours is enough.
I'm goin' UA, and I need you to help me.
wait a second. What?
Mary has a gun.
morning, Sam.
good morning.
Oh, boy, or should I say afternoon?
wow, did I sleep late!
how 'bout you? How'd you sleep, Sammy?
I'm feeling lucky today, Sam.
how 'bout you? You feeling lucky?
in fact, I'm feeling so lucky,
I'm gonna delay my departure a little.
head down to do a little gambling.
Sam, you in there?
Sam, I'm comin' in.
Hey, Reggie.
how are you?
???
???
???
you must be thirsty, right?
???
???
housekeeping, Mike Cannon.
uh, I need to send a crew to Miss Marquez's suite.
uh, it's pretty nasty.
and, uh, send a bellboy up here to take her dog for a walk.
thank you.
what about Mary?
I'll talk to her.
she has a gun, Danny.
I'm worried she's gonna hurt herself, okay?
just find her, stick with her until I can get there, okay?
Danny, don't you think that this is not really appropriate
Delinda, the guy saved my life. I owe him.
okay?
are you feeling okay?
Yeah, yeah.
we just need to talk.
Yeah, well, I'm not apologizing to your father.
Erika, could I get two waters over here?
I'm supposed to ship out in 24 hours, but there's no way I'm going back, no way.
just calm down, J. We'll figure this out.
but you can't go UA.
you don't understand. I can't go back.
I'll kill myself first.
don't even talk
how did you manage to deploy for only one tour?
what did you do to get out of going back?
well, there were special circumstances for my situation.
but I would go back if ordered.
you can take my place.
right, the back taxes are $241 million.
so to tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I want an ownership position here.
I mean, the first owner, uh, he disappeared.
second one's in the federal penitentiary.
the third one flew off the roof, and, uh,
Casey got attacked by a giant squid and apparently poisoned.
sorry to interrupt. I think something's wrong.
I can't find Sam anywhere.
uh, I need to find her.
look, uh, some buyers got wind of this tax problem.
and, uh, my only chance is to partner up with Sam and pay off the taxes before the deadline.
we got no chance in a bidding war. Ed
wait, wait-- yeah, that's right.
well, Miss Marquez and I would be co-owners.
ed, Sam hasn't been in her room for at least a day, maybe more.
uh, she left her dog ???
Sid, can I put you on hold for a second, please? Thanks.
she loves that dog. I mean, that's not like her.
I agree.
now a person, on the other hand, she'd have no problem locking you up for a few days with no food or water.
you need to find her for me, Mike.
okay.
sorry, Sid.
I've had it, Ed. I'm on the phone.
it's me or the Montecito.
what the hell's that?
divorce papers. What?
if you sign ownership papers on the Montecito, you can sign those too.
what is this, "crap on Ed" day?
mom?
what did you do to her now?
I did nothing.
of course you didn't, just like you didn't put surveillance cameras in Danny's and my place.
Delinda, I'm on the phone.
there's a problem with Mary.
what problem?
she has a gun.
are you sure?
I know what a gun looks like.
Hi, Sid, I'm gonna have to call you back in a minute, all right?
Yeah, thanks.
what is the problem?
I don't wanna betray Danny and Mary, but
wait, wait, what does Danny got to do with this?
something happened when Mary was little.
her father...
I think Mary may be planning something.
her father just got released from jail, and I know she wants to protect her younger sisters.
let's video IQ Sam. We need to find her ASAP.
ed just called and told us to video IQ Mary.
what's going on? Mary?
he also wants us to call him if she leaves the Montecito property.
okay, I've got Mary in an empty hallway.
looks like she's headed into the ladies' room.
what about Sam?
there's no sign of her.
let's backtrack to find her last location.
maybe she left the Montecito.
I know I don't need to remind you there are no cameras in the ladies' room.
Yeah, Shannon. I know.
you okay?
I'm pregnant.
make that three.
who loves you, huh?
come on.
here we go.
down here.
those women are known prostitutes.
I'm more worried about the streak he's on.
Mr. Peterson, is your casino host with you?
Sam? No.
she's, uh, tied up at the moment.
you sure?
I peed on ten sticks. Every one came back positive.
does Danny know?
hello. Mike.
Yeah, I see them.
no, no, not the hookers.
see the roll this guy's on? Have you found Sam yet?
do we have Sam's last location pinpointed yet?
she was all over the place, valet, tables, hallways.
wolfgang Puck, lobby, upstairs, downstairs.
she definitely didn't leave the Montecito.
she's here somewhere.
we haven't been able to track her down yet.
I'll send security to escort the ladies out.
maybe that'll slow the table down, okay?
I haven't slept in weeks.
and now these nightmares...
they're taking over when I'm awake.
I-I can't get these images out of my head.
my buddies being blown to pieces...
those innocent women and children.
and body parts everywhere.
have you spoken to your commanding officer?
of course.
if they let every marine who couldn't sleep and had nightmares out on medical discharge,
well, clearly you're in no condition to go back to Iraq.
that's why I'm going UA.
an unauthorized absence is not the way to go.
let me--let me make a few phone calls, see what I can do.
thank you, Lieutenant.
it's not Lieutenant. It's Danny.
thank you, Danny.
you know what?
I'm gonna check you into a room.
let you chill while I figure this out.
come on. Yeah.
Yeah.
wanna talk about it?
about what?
about your father?
no.
Mary, don't you think I know about what happened?
this is not your concern. Just leave it alone.
if you and I are gonna coexist, you gotta start showing me a little respect.
where the hell is she?
thank you, gentlemen, for your kindness and generosity.
sorry, folks, but I've got a plane to catch.
I'll credit your account and let Sam know.
Oh, that's all right. I'll let Sam know myself.
ladies.
what's going on with you?
nothing.
Delinda told me you have a gun.
I don't know what she's talking about.
where is it?
I put it away.
it's for protection in case my father comes after me for testifying against him.
you didn't see the way he looked at me, Danny.
I'm scared.
that's what the police are for.
the police let him go.
and he just sat there with that smirk on his face, mocking me.
Oh, hey, my stepmother took him back.
that means he's with my little sisters.
son of a bitch.
does he still go to that bar after work every night?
Oh, yeah.
same one he went to since we were kids.
???
???
you think I should have a little chitchat with
please just leave it alone.
hopefully, I'll never see him again.
just promise me you're not gonna do anything stupid, please.
I won't.
I promise.
okay.
I have to get back to work.
that hurt?
no. It's fine.
Hey, Mike, we pinpointed Sam's last position.
but there's a problem.
what kind of problem?
remember that three-minute glitch in the south elevator bank?
Sam was on one of the elevators.
she could be on any one of 60 floors.
well, let's start checking. One floor at a time.
the only problem with that is the glitch affected the cameras outside the elevator bank as well.
so if Sam entered a room within a hundred feet of the elevators during those three minutes, we'll never find her.
help!
somebody help me!
help!
you wanna party?
Oh, thanks, but no, thanks.
I've got a party up in my room
I'm waiting to get to.
in fact, I'm feeling downright frisky.
help!
we need to talk.
you okay?
Danny, where do you see our relationship going?
did you make those calls yet?
Yeah, I did, but I haven't heard anything back yet, so
if you don't come through for me, Danny,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I will call you as soon as I hear something.
go back to your room and relax. Have a whiskey or something. No.
no, I can't. I can't, I can't.
I feel like the freaking walls are closing in on me.
I think I'm losing it.
well, if the walls are closing in,
I guess we should get you a bigger suite.
give me a minute.
I'm pregnant.
no sign of her on floors 1 through 15.
15 through 30 are clear as well.
well, check 30 through 60.
30 through 60 are clear.
there's no sign of her anywhere.
she disappeared during the three minutes the cameras were out.
you think someone grabbed her.
Yeah, sure seems like it.
Mitch, run a diagnostics on the entire system.
we did that when it went down. We got nothing.
well, run it again.
let's start checking every camera on every floor in the south wing.
maybe we can get lucky and pick up a piece of her.
that's over a thousand camas.
I know. So let's get moving.
answer, answer.
Lucy, I'm home!
answer the phone, answer the phone.
good evening, Mr. Peterson.
what are you doing, Sam?
if you needed to stretch your legs, you should have said so.
now look what you've done. You've given yourself a boo-boo.
you'll never get away with this. Get away with what?
what do you think I have planned, Sam?
whatever it is, you'll never get away with it.
I've gotten away with it so many times before, why should this be any different?
you're sick.
no. I'm rich.
and when you're rich, you can get away with anything.
that's what makes America such a great country.
I have to go to the bathroom.
go ahead and go.
damp girls kinda get me excited.
whatever it is that you're gonna do...
just do it.
like just do it and get it over with?
this is foreplay, Sam. I'm taking you with me.
housekeeping.
come back later.
help!
when I'm through with you, you're gonna wish you were dead.
this is Mr. Peterson.
I need a couple of bellboys to help with my luggage.
and if they're in my suite in two minutes,
I'll give' em a thousand dollars each.
thank you.
it's time for us to check out, Sammy baby.
he's already done three tours.
I'm telling you, the guy is in no condition to go back to a war zone.
no, I'm not a doctor
fine, I'll get a doctor to look at him.
only an authorized military physician?
all right, who's your CO?
general McAllister. Okay.
all right, thanks. I'll call him.
what did you want to tell me?
I'm pregnant.
are you-- are you kidding me?
I'm gonna be a grandmother?
mom, please. Please don't do that.
I'm sorry.
I take it this was a big surprise.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. And?
and I don't know what to do.
well, what does Danny want to do?
well, he doesn't-- he doesn't know yet.
well, honey, you have to tell him.
no, I know. It's just
but what?
what if he doesn't want to do what I want to do?
how are you gonna know if you don't tell him?
I love him, Mom, I really do, but after everything that's happened and
and he and Daddy getting into it
don't let your father influence your life.
take him out of the equation. I have.
what's that supposed to mean?
I gave your dad an ultimatum.
I said it's me or the Montecito.
what did he say?
he hasn't yet, but...
honey, just go talk to Danny.
I think he may still have feelings for Mary, Mom, and if he does,
I don't want this to influence him one way or the other.
there's something moving around in your trunk.
Oh, yeah. That's just my sex toys.
Hey, it's Vegas, right?
here's the thousand dollars I promised you.
thank you. Here you are, my friend.
uh, General McAllister.
thank you so much for calling me back, sir.
thank you, sir.
uh, no, sir.
um, I'm actually calling about a fellow marine,
I know, sir, but
I just don't think that he's fit for duty.
Yes, sir.
thank you, sir.
look, Jillian, we need to talk.
okay. Why don't you come to Wolfgang's?
we'll have an early dinner.
okay, I'm not really that hungry yet.
why don't you just come up to my office?
no, you know what? I'm tired of coming to you.
you want to talk, you come to me.
that felt good.
don't tell Daddy I'm pregnant.
well, where are you going?
I'm gonna talk to Danny.
I'm sorry, J, but you gotta go.
you gotta ship out in the morning.
but they promised me that once you get there they'll give you a full medical eval, and if the doctors agree, they'll send you home.
that's what they said before my last tour.
listen, if I could take your place, I would.
thank you... for the suite and the hospitality, Lieutenant.
maybe we can catch a beer later.
sure.
that three-minute glitch wasn't a glitch.
somebody shut down the cameras manually, then turned them back on.
I think Shannon was right. Somebody grabbed Sam.
we gotta find her.
general McAllister, please.
I got her.
you sure that's her?
pretty sure.
it looks like she entered a room.
whose room?
check it now.
what room is that?
get security up there.
Mitch, video IQ Peterson.
???
Yes, sir.
general, I'm sure.
sir, I understand that.
Yes, sir, I understand.
Vince Peterson just checked out.
find him, Mitch.
workin' on it.
Whoa!
careful with that.
???
there's no sign of Sam.
Peterson's suite is empty.
first, with everything going on,
I don't need you hanging up on me.
and, yes, I do think my marriage is more important than the Montecito, okay?
okay.
so retire.
I don't want to retire.
what the hell am I gonna do?
play with your grandchild.
what did you just say?
Delinda's pregnant.
huh.
now, when she tells you, you have to pretend like you don't know, okay?
boy or girl?
Oh, honey, it's too early to tell.
right, right.
it's wonderful, isn't it?
I'm gonna be a grandpa.
but don't say anything, because she hasn't told Danny yet.
she--she wants to surprise him, right?
Yeah. Something like that.
get me Ed.
Yeah.
ed, you wanted us to let you know if Mary left the Montecito-- she did, and Danny followed.
all right, thanks, Mitch.
d, I need you to check on Jason.
tell him everything's worked out.
he's not gonna have to deploy.
Danny, I'm pregnant.
I wanna keep the baby. I want us to keep the baby.
baby, I can't-- Baby, you're breaking up.
I can't hear you.
I'm gonna call you... in a little bit.
let me see thermal imaging on that trunk.
she's in the trunk.
that's not a Montecito Escalade.
find out whose Escalade that is and where it's headed and call me with the info.
and get a hold of Ed and Danny and tell them what's happening.
yeah?
sorry to bother you, Mr. Deline, but I have a General McAllister on the line for you.
he says it's urgent.
general McAllister, yeah.
put him through, please.
what's this?
Yeah, Mac. What's going on?
what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I-I know it's his choice.
listen, just, uh, do me a favor.
don't do anything until I get a chance to talk to him, okay?
appreciate it. All right, thanks, pal.
stupid kid.
who?
I mean, he has no idea how many strings I pulled for this not to happen.
what? What's going on?
he volunteered to deploy in place of some other marine.
Oh, my God.
they're supposed to ship out tomorrow.
???
I want wheels up in less than five.
I can't get a hold of Ed.
it's going straight to his voice mail.
keep trying. I'll keep trying Danny.
surveillance cams in the south elevator bank just went out.
get me backup.
backup's out too.
two nights in a row.
we have reports of gunfire in the transfer hall outside the vault.
we're being hit.
get me security down there right now.
get me eyes to the transfer hall now.
infrared imaging is coming online.
get me the security team's audio channel.
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Danny sent me to check on you.
I got good news.
I'm not going back.
you don't have to go back. Danny took care of it.
Jason, what are you doing?
they can't make me go.
listen,
I just talked to Danny.
you don't have to go back.
IEDs are a lot easier to make than you think.
why do you think we're getting our asses blown up every day?
now I know.
no, no, no!
listen.
whatever you're planning, please don't do it.
get away from that door.
okay. Look.
I'm just gonna call Danny, okay?
it's just Danny.
yeah? Danny.
Hey. What's wrong? Where are you?
with Jason.
he doesn't believe me.
you have to talk to him.
I can't right now.
Danny, he has a bomb. What?
yeah?
ed, the Montecito's being hit.
what?
we have simultaneous fire alarms on floors 35 through 38.
Oh, my God.
hunt
I'm not going to annihilate 4. 3 million Pakistanis without hearing from someone whose authority I recognize.
our own people tried to sink us?
a
we have commandeered the NATO early warning station on the island of Sainte Marina.
I am declaring a 200-mile no-man's-land around this island.
test us, and we will all burn.
you've been warned.
they told me, put their drug in the water, and you would go to sleep.
they promised me my island back.
did you kill those men out there?
your friends were already dead when I got here.
I don't have time to do it the nice way.
we made a very simple arrangement.
everything's negotiable.
who are you? Tell me. Tell me!
he's a government agent sent to spy on me and turn me against Sam.
I'm gonna fix everything. You'll see, Christine.
what are you doing, Sam?
captain Butler has a firing solution on the Colorado.
I could kill you right now. - Do you want a war?
when I was unconscious, someone took my firing key.
we now have no nuclear launch capabilities.
lieutenant Shepard, how much longer is he gonna take?
we do what we're told.
cause that's worked out so well for us so far.
you almost done, XO?
I think some of these guys are about 30 seconds from coming over here and getting an article 90.
well, it's gonna take as long as it takes, Lieutenant.
that's my bag, sir. - I'm sorry. No one's exempt.
we don't know who helped those men with the BZ attack.
we know who attacked us. Black ops with help from Serrat.
then who stole the epipens on the sub?
there's somebody on the inside. You know it, and I know it.
why don't you just let me help you?
do I have to spell it out for you, Lieutenant?
so I'm a suspect? You think that I betrayed the crew?
I don't know. You're dismissed.
you're pulling rank on me? - I don't pull rank, Lieutenant. I have rank.
no sign of the key.
but if we keep treating them like this, we're gonna lose 'em.
the only people on board when the key was stolen were crew members, XO.
one of them is the enemy.
and until we find out who, the only people who can know about the key are you and me.
but it's been 48 hours, sir.
if the goal was to render us defenseless, then how come we're not already dead?
our Judas hasn't reported their success yet.
but once they do... - At least let me tell grace.
Grace's father was hauled out of here in military custody, Sam.
is it impossible to imagine her doing something rash?
I back Lieutenant Shepard 100%, sir. 100%.
until this thing is over, we will be ruled by fact and not emotion.
and the fact is, we have been betrayed.
we keep searching the crew.
we keep this up, we're not gonna have a crew.
quiet! They tossed my bunk, too.
you don't see me bitchin' about somebody spittin' in my grits.
XO wants these coffin lockers open.
open 'em up. Now file out.
what do you got there?
it's a night guard, COB, for my overbite.
Hey, Kurt Cobain. Where'd you get this?
I... - You been using? You've been using!
you want this junk? You want this? Huh?!
Where'd you get it?
the only two people who know you're still alive are the two you're looking at.
and that's lucky for you. I know a couple of Navy SEALs that would love to come say hi.
who's the traitor on my boat?
here I thought you were gonna start with my name.
it's Booth.
booth? Okay, Booth.
we know you had assistance during the attack.
we want to know who you're working with.
come on, Captain. You must have heard the rumors.
the word among sub captains for a while has been that the CIA has a sleeper agent on every nuclear sub...
just in case some crazy captain gets the wrong idea.
and whoever it is in your crew, judging from the urgency of the question, I guess they pulled it off.
pulled off what, exactly?
their mission. The firing key from around your neck.
I see I'm right.
so that's who you're with-- the CIA?
hell of a feeling, isn't it?
enjoy your lunch, because I will keep you here where you can hear your breath and your heartbeat and nothing else until you give me a name.
compartmentalization, Captain. Why would I know?
you can torture me again, but I don't know a name, a face, or even a voice.
well, maybe he's lying. - I doubt it.
but there is one other person who may know.
you should post more guards.
Why? I have nothing to fear.
you aided foreigners in an attack on this island using a military drug. COB.
tear it apart. Load everything up in boxes.
Yes, sir.
something I value greatly was taken from me during the attack.
if you can tell me where to find it or who took it, we're good.
if not, I do have 28 cruise missiles on my boat.
cruise missile? I've been threatened with many things, but never a cruise missile.
put 'em on the truck. We'll open 'em later.
search him.
last time I was here, he was the one in control.
I like it this way better.
what are you looking at?
the back of your neck. I like your hair up.
I make better tips with it down.
guys in bars like to think the girls pouring their drinks are free spirits.
that way, if they say something interesting enough, they'll hop into bed with them.
can you imagine such stupidity?
I can help you bury your friends. I don't mind.
gotta be just me and Hopper.
go bury your friends. Come back.
I'll-- I'll close down the bar.
we'll drink ourselves stupid and fire guns in the air, whatever you like.
you're good for me.
that's a problem?
just not used to it.
who are you? What are you doing here?
tell me. Tell me!
what is all this?
we had to store Serrat's stuff somewhere.
everything has to be searched, including your office.
you're looking through my things?
you want to tell me what you were doing at Serrat's?
I went to listen to music. Is that allowed?
did you search my computer as well?
okay, if you want to search me, go ahead. I can't stop you.
but you know I was not involved.
I don't know what you are. Not for sure.
well, maybe that makes two of us.
I know you're selling to my guys. No more.
listen, old man, you need something, you just ask.
don't deal to Navy.
the nuclear attack on Pakistan
was the terrorist threat the government used to justify it
was it real or was it just an excuse?
a false flag to validate the first shot of a man who wants to be an emperor, not a president.
and your boat and the citizens of that nation paid the price.
Yeah, enjoy it, man. You're the good guys.
but here's the twist-- so are we.
you killed two Navy SEALs. You're the good guys?
we tried to avoid that.
my team was just supposed to grab Hopper while the sleeper took your captain's key.
why steal the firing key? Why not reach out? Why not form an alliance?
you may think he's some kind of chess master, but nobody knows if Chaplin is just bluffing or if he's actually insane.
either way, it's too dangerous to let him stay parked out here with 17 nukes.
have you seen his NSMRL psych profile?
do you know he has rage issues and borderline narcissistic personality traits?
you know who else he shares those traits with? - Who's that?
gadhafi, Stalin, Jim Jones.
Churchill, Macarthur, Patton.
look, Booth, can you help get us home or not?
we don't want you to come home, Sam.
the Colorado needs to be the symbol of resistance.
we need you to stay here, keep doing what you're doing.
but not with Chaplin in charge. We want you.
you we can work with.
you got a funny way of working with people, Booth.
the president's not gonna last, not with you here.
everything's turning against him. I'm talking six months, maybe a year... Then you can
no, no, no. I'm not waiting that long.
what if Christine was here? What if we brought her to you?
I can make that happen, Sam.
you know, you're not my boss anymore. I work for your brother now.
you still know what this is?
we developed it for NSA domestic surveillance.
plug it into the USB port of the car.
give it 20 seconds for the program to migrate.
after that, every time the driver makes a call through the hands-free, you get the call on this.
now as for getting into the car, use that.
infrared scrambler-- unlocks 99% of automobiles manufactured after 2008.
I thought you would be the one getting into the car.
I'm just bringing you your own tech, not committing a felony.
for that, I'd need a lot more money, and I'd have to clear it with your brother.
go. - Pleasure.
personnel files?
there were 35 crew members on board when the launch key was stolen.
you think you can figure out who took it by reading these?
I think the sum of a person's life can be deduced from its parts.
the traitor must be communicating with Langley.
how?
honestly, sir, I don't know.
finding the key is not a priority, XO. It's the priority.
and remember, your key is a target, too.
I'm instituting a curfew on the crew.
I understand what it means to be without our launch key, sir, I do, and I am searching without rest.
but we need to start thinking about the morale of the crew here.
there's a time and place for taking the morale of the crew into consideration.
but right now, right here, there is a traitor on my boat who has put us in a position of mortal weakness.
we are searching for a key on an island.
needle in a haystack" doesn't even come close.
but I will continue searching until you tell me to stop.
but with respect, sir, you need to start looking at the crew, not just their files.
you know...
we're not the only ones putting people in the ground.
what are you talking about?
that black-ops team that came after us.
navy buried them this morning. - Yeah.
four graves.
how many were on that team?
Where's the fifth black op? - There were four.
no, you buried four, but there were five. One's still alive.
if that were true, I'd know. Captain or the XO would have told me.
you sure about that?
let's go, King.
sir, did any of the black ops survive the BZ attack?
no. Why do you ask?
just thought it was relevant since you're searching for BZ, sir.
you advanced rapidly.
how was it, specifically, you ended up on my boat?
I always assumed it was because you asked for me.
maybe my father pulled some strings. I really don't know, sir.
I like to think I'm best qualified, that I proved myself.
thank you, Lieutenant.
sorry, Lieutenant. I
what's in the backpack?
nothing, ma'am.
you know the captain's implemented a curfew?
Yes, ma'am, but we'll be back by then.
it was just gonna be me and a couple of girls, blow off a little steam before lights out.
I'm sorry, ma'am. I should know better.
go. You didn't see me.
uh... Lieutenant?
what is it, Cortez?
you doing anything right now?
I warned you.
you tell your... friends... your boss...
and your kids...
don't deal to the Navy.
next time, these go in your head.
you can stop pretending to check your Twitter, Ms. Sinclair.
the Admiral isn't coming.
who are you? - Forrest.
I'm a friend of his. And a friend of yours now.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Admiral Shepard is in jail, and not the kind where they have visiting hours.
do you know Amanda Straugh?
white House Senior Advisor, loved scotch, died last week in a plane crash over the pacific.
not exactly.
Straugh was shot and killed during negotiations on Sainte Marina.
the President has a problem.
he says this woman's body is at the bottom of the ocean.
if this photo were to show up on the news, millions would know he's lying about it.
they might start wondering what else he's lying about.
wait, wait, wait. I thought we were talking about the best lies we ever pulled off.
Unh-unh. I don't have any of those.
you are looking at a straight-A, never cheated, never got in trouble.
sad, but true.
okay, all that was a lie.
what about you, Lieutenant Shepard?
Yeah, they don't make 'em more straight-A than you.
well, I'm relaxing. - Yeah?
then start looking relaxed, Lieutenant.
they're just mineral samples.
you and Serrat have the same vials.
you were at his place sharing I don't know what.
I don't have to answer you. - Yes, you do.
or what, you'll hurt me like you hurt that man?
that wasn't me. - Oh, come on.
Hey, what are you doing? - Look at this.
no, turn it off. - No. No, no, no.
does it look like I'm enjoying this? - Okay, turn it off.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Does it look like I want this?
Sam. - Everything's gonna be different now, I promise.
stop it. - What's this?
I always find my way back, don't I?
well, before I went into the academy, I-I took the SATs for someone else.
you know, the girl-- the girl was really smart, but she just couldn't take tests.
you know, she had this anxiety disorder, and her family had no money, so if, uh, she didn't get a scholarship, she couldn't go to college.
so I copied her ID and took the test.
I think the statute of limitations has passed.
to the statute of limitations.
can I ask you something, Cortez? - Yes, ma'am.
what happened with Serrat?
you were locked in that room with Red and Josh for days. What happened?
I know what everyone thinks I did. But I didn't.
I promised him I'd be his eyes and ears if he'd let us live.
tell him what was going on with the sub.
a few hours later, he killed Red. Deal was off.
would you have? - Been a traitor?
I had a dog...
when I was a little kid, and one day, it turned on me, bit me.
my dad... shot it.
said once a dog turns on you, you never trust it again.
only thing to do is put it down.
same with a traitor.
Christine, what would you like the American people to know about your husband?
the administration keeps calling my husband a terrorist.
but then why were they trying to negotiate with him?
and why are they keeping those negotiations such a secret that they had to lie about Amanda Straugh's death?
you're making some very serious allegations.
does this look like a plane crash?
Amanda Straugh was shot by one of the government's own people, and the White House is trying to cover it up, just like they are trying to cover up the truth about my husband and the USS Colorado.
thank you, mama.
who did this to you? - Who do you think?
all right. Listen up. Fall in.
everybody, fall in. Tighten it up. Let's go. Lock it down.
stop your bellyaching and fall in here.
so the Junior Lt. sees this little boy sitting on the sidewalk...
playing with a pile of manure.
the Lt. asks the little boy, "What are you doing playing with that manure?
and the boy says,"I'm building an NCO."
lt. runs back to company HQ, gets his section chief, who asks the little boy,"Son...
why are you playing with a pile of manure?
little boy says,"I'm building an NCO."
chief goes and gets the COB, who goes back to the little boy.
what-- what-- what are you doing playing with that manure?
little boy says... "I'm building an NCO."
why are you building an NCO?
little boy pauses and says, "Because, sir, I don't have enough crap to build an officer.
what do you get when you breed a West Point cadet and a groundhog?
six more weeks of bad football.
how come the army football team doesn't have ice on the sidelines?
the guy with the recipe graduated.
that's right. That's right.
now listen up. Listen up! Listen up! Listen up!
I know we've put you through a hell of a lot lately.
and all I can tell you-- it's for a good reason.
but... I hereby order you...
to enjoy the 1991 Army/Navy football game.
spoiler alert-- the crunchies don't win.
but look. Look, look, look, look, look.
you are the best crew an XO could have the honor of leading.
thank you, and I appreciate it.
sir.
brought you a beer, if you want it.
thank you.
you should go back and watch the game with the crew.
I just...
I just wanted to state, for the record, that I'm with you, Captain, all the way...
whenever you need me.
Cortez, thank you.
but you should not seek me out alone.
there's an order and a morality that we both have to follow.
well, it seems like everything's changed, Captain.
not everything. Understood?
what do you got there, Sam?
Oh, boy.
are you kidding me?
sure. I mean, the guy you got in there killed two of my pals.
so why not let him enjoy a cold one?
I need to know what he knows.
Yeah, that makes three of us.
stand down. Let us do what we do.
when we're done, we got a nice resting place for him out in the jungle.
listen to me. I've been working him. I'm building trust and I'm close.
so right now you gotta back off and let me finish what I started.
what do you think he knows?
I think he knows how to get us all home.
come on, King. This guy's an amateur. Let's go.
no, Hop. We fall back.
XO's got this one. For now.
how are you sleeping? Not good?
wonder how your wife's sleeping?
so what, JSOC gave you the download on Christine, and now you think you know me?
no. They gave me the download on you
north Korea, the gun to your head, the click.
I know you can't stop blaming yourself for those seven men who died so you could make it back home.
now Marcus has landed you in prison again.
Yeah, it's beautiful, but... let's be real about what it is.
how much are you willing to give that man?
your sleeper will be communicating with Langley by a secure radio channel, which means there's a comm site somewhere on this island.
find that site, you'll have him.
now... you ready to start helping yourself?
if we were to do this, how would we do it?
simple snatch and grab.
Marcus will be kept out of sight, but treated well while you run things here, forcing a change of guard at the White House.
then the new administration arranges for amnesty... for all of you.
that fifth black op is alive.
your Captain and your XO are keeping him locked away.
bet you always raised your hand first in class, didn't you?
no, stop! Don't come near me.
everybody keep away from her!
cruise
snyder, you need to stay calm.
it's on a timer.
how much time is left? - I don't know.
take it off. Just take it off of me.
I can't. It's wired to the buckle. You gotta stop shaking.
I'm trying. - Try harder.
Hey, calm down. It's okay. We got you.
how much time is left on it?
plenty.
just take it off of me.
okay, okay.
what happened? - Nothing. It's okay. It's okay.
grace, I need eyes.
here.
okay.
now I gotta get that red wire without touching the yellow.
can you keep the lead away? The yellow lead.
time's up.
are you out of your mind?
I have white house lawyers calling me about this interview you taped today.
you did the exact opposite of what I told you.
the reporter said that maybe it would help.
the reporter's gonna say whatever gets her the story!
and where the hell did you get this picture of Amanda Straugh?
somebody put it in my mailbox.
somebody put it in your mailbox? What is wrong with you?
stop yelling at me! You don't get to yell at me.
I am doing the best that I can here.
do you understand how much pressure I am under?
I am all alone here, and my husband is out there somewhere, about to get killed at any second.
you're right. It's my fault. I should've kept an eye on you.
I'm sorry.
it's just, um... It's all just starting to get to me
the empty house, the sleeping alone, except I can't even sleep because the damn faucet won't stop dripping.
Hey, hey, calm down.
it's all gonna be fine.
why don't I take a look at the faucet?
I'm gonna need, uh, long-nose pliers for this. I got a tool kit in the trunk.
what? Wait. - I'll be right back.
look...
I'm sorry that I disappointed you today.
you are the only one that's left that's fighting for me.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
no, no. - I-I'm sorry. Was it just me?
I don't know. But it can't be me.
look, I'm having very confusing feelings right now and...
can you just be patient with that?
of course.
you were good.
so were you.
what? What?
been wondering what that looks like.
one time thing. - Sure.
Thanks. - Thank you.
where is he?!
where am I? I don't think you know what you are looking for. Bring him.
I presume you are looking for the man who strapped a bomb to one of your people?
I just heard.
you see? I caught him for you.
I came for you. - Uh, me.
Yeah, yeah, you could take me, but the people won't allow it because I'm their friend, and they love me.
and they know I have done nothing.
this is the man responsible for your bomb.
it's sad. He thought it would impress me. Tell him.
it was my idea. I did it. Just me.
you should be grateful I brought this man to justice.
I will deal with him appropriately. - No. I will.
this man has admitted to the attempted mass murder of my crew.
try me again, and I will be your judge, jury, and executioner.
Christine. Someone's calling him.
connection - Hello. - This is Curry. What do you have?
what the hell's going on?
somebody put the photo in her mailbox, which means you've got a leak in the White House, so you can stop blaming me for not keeping her in line.
and look, I don't want to do this anymore.
do you want to see Daniel again?
of course I do. He's my son.
all I'm saying is, you've got her in an impossible situation.
what do you expect her to do?
let me throw her a line.
just stick to the plan and don't get too attached, Paul.
the parameters can always change.
I'll check in later.
everything that happened was crazy, right?
they drugged us. The BZ affected us all.
I'm sorry.
only an American would apologize for a kiss.
I'm not working with Serrat.
I am paying a debt my ex-boyfriend had.
Serrat paid him to test the soil here for rare earth minerals.
that's what the samples were for.
this island-- it is worth a lot of money.
okay.
I wanted you to know so you would not think I lied to you.
but I need you to promise me you will keep it secret, and not only from Serrat. From everybody.
I can't promise you anything right now.
okay.
that can be your choice, but... now you know that I will not lie to you.
that's my choice.
all right, easy now. Easy now.
your men are prisoners on this island.
why are you so angry about them paying me for a few hours of escape?
why do you feel as though you can control what other people do?
why are you so afraid?
I've lived all over the world. I've seen many men like you.
you have a thirst, I think. What is your particular poison?
heroin? Cocaine?
no. No. For you, something more exotic.
Apnoea? Oxy? Fentanyl?
the eyes don't lie.
your pupils just went like this, my friend.
I kicked that-- I kicked that a long time ago. End of story.
Oh, yeah. You know, for someone like you, the story never really ends, does it?
this is a powerful painkiller, yes? I know pain.
you recall my mother? - I haven't had the pleasure.
Ah, but you have. She's with one arm.
Yes. Yes, yes, surely, surely you noticed her.
Yes, I think.
you see, when I was a boy, some men came to my village.
they wanted to take me into the bush with them.
my mother tried to stop them. - Get 'em away from me!
she was only 12 when I was born, so she was my mother, but she was also like my sister.
the men, they said to me, they said,"You go take this machete now, Eah Bo.
you're going to chop off your mother's arm or we will kill her.
can you imagine?
that was my first day as a soldier.
now I'm going to take the pain away.
Yes.
Yes. This is for when the pain comes back.
so we're executioners now?
there's no other option.
have your conversations with Booth borne fruit?
well, he claims that whoever the sleeper agent is has a comm site on the island to communicate with their handlers.
he also claims that we're the resistance to what's going on back home.
maybe he's right.
okay. We stop looking for the key. No more rousting the crew.
we look for the comm site. We find the traitor, we find the key.
Marcus Chaplin will never fire on a US Navy ship.
fire one. - No, belay that. Do not fire.
you disobeyed my order? When I'm on the conn, my word is law!
I did this for you.
cob, you know we wouldn't make a move without your go, but terminating the Captain's commandmay be an option we have to consider.
everybody, say hello to the XO. - Marcus isn't dying. I need to know everything.
welcome to the deep end of the pool.
senior Chief Petty Officer Harold Anders, you're hereby relieved of duty.
if it were up to me, it'd be a lot worse.
I won't have an admitted rapist walk free on my boat.
I'll see you in hell, Sir.
did they send you here to kill me? - Yes, Sir.
I have enemies, Cortez. - I am not one of them.
you'll no longer be at the mercy of the United States.
at the mercy of the current administration.
don't ever confuse my nation with its current ruler.
there are people, powerful people, who are gathering right now, organizing a coup d'etat.
tomorrow a marine force recon contingent will place the Presidentand the Vice President under arrest.
now, Mr. Speaker, you will announcethat you are assuming the presidency.
this is really happening, isn't it?
do you really think we're making it better?
the sex?
the world.
I mean, we're...
we're gonna... - Orchestrate a coup. You can say it out loud.
it's the saying it part that worries me.
if you're gonna get Maudlin, then I'm going to Breakfast Barn.
our meeting's not for another three hours.
and you can stop pretendingthat I'm the only one who's nervous.
I'm not nervous.
no. I've been having sex in a random hotel room all nightbecause the thoughtof sharing a wiki page - with John Wilkes Booth, that really does it for me. - We're not shooting anyone.
not today.
all it takes is for one thing to go wrong.
we're really gonna do this, aren't we?
Yep. We are...
today.
the only reason I fired ona US Navy vessel was to protect the supplies, to feed my people.
I'm not your ally, Zheng.
ally, friend-- whatever you call it, Captain, I see the beginning of a new change.
something in the air.
you forced me into a dangerous PR stunt.
I fail to appreciate its subtleties.
well, you provided for those in need.
and today a new supply ship is out there waiting to unload.
and right here, celebrations unfold for you.
this has nothing to do with me.
it's an island holiday-- the festival of Sun and Moon.
well, you know your island well.
you've been buttering my bread pretty good this morning.
do you employ the same strategiesin your meeting with Mr. Serrat?
well, different strokes for different folks, Captain. - What's he after?
that would be telling.
there's only one big dog on this island, Mr. Zheng, and you're looking at him.
don't make the mistake of trying to play both sides.
make your choice, now.
the soil here has tested very richin some rare minerals.
Mr. Serrat wants my help in exploiting those resources.
and you promised him what? - Nothing.
as you pointed out, only one of you has nuclear teeth.
perhaps you and Ican discuss a partnership.
panning for gold, Mr. Zheng? - Compared to these minerals, gold is cheap.
I'm talking about economic freedom, the end of want.
so far, you've only ruled here by threat of violence.
how long can fear be the only currency you possess?
all right. I'm listening.
you need to eat.
I'm sure you haven't had anything in days. - I eat. I'm fine.
do you sleep? - Sophie, please.
because you don't seem fine.
I'm fine.- Look, if you want to talk about your wife or anything
what, you want to talk about Serrat? You want to talk about that?
are you living with him now, is that it?
Yes, but it's not what you think. It's more complicated.
it's more complicated. Okay.
the man is a killer, Sophie. He is scum of the earth, okay?
and you're letting him show you off like he owns you.
is that what you want? - I know what I'm doing.
Hi. - hi - Where you been for the last week? - I was, um, at my father's with my brother.
had a few things to sort through.
is everything all right?
Yeah.
well, no. It will be.
I wasn't expecting you to still be here. - Are you kidding?
it's the closest bed to the only bar in town.
I'm, um, I'm leaving.
I'm actually here just to-- to pack a few things. I'm leaving the island.
Why?
I'm taking my brother back to Australia.
a lot's changed.
it's not safe here anymore.
because of all us cowboys.
Yeah. Because of all you cowboys.
I wish I could stay, but I can't, and I know you can't leave. - I'll go.
you don't have to say that. - No.
you know, I want to go with you...
wherever you're going.
tani, I'll go.
if you want.
state-of-the-art scramblerI borrowed from the company a while back.
very handy when you're dating a bullfighteragainst your father's wishes.
well, if this communication is intercepted--Don't worry.
as long as you can get Chaplin on the other end, you're good to go.
he'll be there. A friend of a friend is helping me out.
all right, Cortez, I'm here. I've cleared the room.
Where's my mystery guest?
I don't know, Sir.
I was only told it was vital to bring you here for this.
you're the last person I expected to see.
well, I apologize for the extreme security, but I think you'll appreciate the effort once I explain the situation.
why aren't you in custody for killing Amanda Straugh? - Marcus, listen, friends are gathering. A patriotic force will depose
president Bolton at a joint session of Congress today.
now what we need from you is-- - Arthur, you know that I've hadnothing but tricks and traps thrown at me.
how do I know there's not a gun to your head right now? - Well, you don't have to trust me. Just watch.
now certain facts have recently come to light, like what really happened in Pakistan and to your boat.
the truth is coming out.
and once it does, it'll be time to bring you home. - Sir?
you do want to come back, don't you?
I would like nothing better. - All right.
well, get ready to make a statement later today, because when this comes to a head, the world's gonna want to hear from you.
asia is a powder keg, so bringing you and your nuclear missiles happily home is gonna ease a lot of tension.
just wish us fair winds.
and following seas.
okay.
so I'll check in on the military stations.
but essentially the pieces are already in place.
now we just let our little revolution out into the worldand see if she can stand on her own.
this is insane.
I'm not a revolutionary. I'm just a gun salesman.
I mean, I'm a very good gun salesman, but I'm just a gun salesman. - Stop it.
the woman who accosted me in the DOD Rotunda, worrying about her weapons system, that was a gun salesman.
but the one in front of me now-- - Forrest is missing.
and I don't mean, like, overslept. No one knows where the hell she is.
okay, but that could be anything, right?
forrest's jobwas to get your flash drive to Speaker Buell and present it on the floor of the House with him. Now Buell's already on the fence.
so if we don't get him some backup--I know. I know. I know. I'll do it.
no, absolutely not. - Just relax, okay?
they like me at the House of Representatives. I spend a lot of money there.
I need to sit down with the XO. - Sir...
are you sure you can trust him?
what do you know that I don't?
Sam...told youthat the CIA wanted the Coloradoto be the resistance.
but they didn't want you in charge. Just him.
all he had to do was take command of the sub.
that was their offer. - You're overstepping, Cortez.
his wife was just killed.
you know how that changes a man.
sir-- - Wait for me in the jeep.
why are there never any sports on TV here?
it's always weather or seayaks.
drink?
no. I'm okay right now. Thank you. - I want you to do me a favor, Sam.
I want you to have a drink with me, man.
you gonna eat that?
I've seen that look before.
it doesn't usually lead to good things.
you want to drink? Let's drink.
now you're talking.
to all those who never make it home.
and there is nothing, absolutely nothing, worth half a damnas simply messing around in boats.
and to Christine.
that's the supply ship. - Yep.
looks like their crew made out okay.
captain, we had no sonar contacts. Nothing on radar.
a fuel leak may have ignited.
captain Chaplin, I've just spoken to my superiors, and I'm afraid my governmentwill need a full accounting of that event.
well, we're trying to determine the cause of the explosionright now, Mr. Zheng.
in the meantime, Lieutenant Shepardwill form and oversee a recovery team.
let's get any food, any medical supplies, anything useful and intact, - out of the water and stowed away. - Yes, Sir.
Marcus, if security becomes a problem, - China's offer of assistance may, by necessity, evolve. - Sorry. To what, exactly?
I'm sure you'd agree, we have the right to defend ourselves. - No, I wouldn't agree.
if you'll excuse us, Mr. Zheng.
look, I know you're going through a lot lately, but if you're gonna drink this early in the morning, brush your teeth before you report.
it was like the 4th of July out there, man. - Oh, it was so...
it was beautiful, COB. We set her right amidships at the waterline.
cracked her spine like a body slam off the top rope.
stow that crap. This isn't halftime at the homecoming game.
you guys want to get back to the States, you need to shut up, focus up, and get it done.
did you get eyes on the XO? - Saw him talking with Chaplin and the fortune cookie.
think Kendal's still with us? - I don't wanna think. I wanna know.
well, it ain't gonna matter who's with usunless we secure more guns.
way ahead of you, sailor, as usual.
master Chief. The COB.
you're walking. Your feet must be killing you.
I need to talk to you. - You're a very courageous man. You have no fear.
but of course fentanyl is good for that. If you need some more - to keep the fear away, just talk to Armand. - No, I'm good.
let's you and me talk about making the suband everyone on board disappear.
I have heard rumors. Discontent amongst your men.
cut the crap, jocko.
you want us gone. I want to be gone. You have guns. I need 'em.
and how do you propose to pay for these guns you say you want?
by getting the USS Coloradoout of your business, permanently.
you interested?
you're late. - I'm sorry, Sir. It was hard to slip away.
you should've warned me about the supply ship.
I didn't know.
Prosser keeps the big things to himself.
he gives me smaller jobs to do.
I'm supposed to get the key to the Colorado's armory. - Well, that's not gonna help.
the sub's firearms are no longer accessible. I switched out the locks.
Where's the XO on this?
he didn't tell you?
the XO walked in on a meeting, and they chased him.
sir, I think... think Prosser knows about me.
I mean, he looks at me, and I swear to God, he can--I would get that out of my head, son.
you were brave enough to threaten my sub with a grenade.
you're brave enough to save her.
what, are you insane? I'm telling you, the Chinese are just looking for an excuse to get into it.
you blow up their boat, you hand it to them.
let 'em come. I'd prefer an honest fight. - Joe, you're gonna get everybody killed.
no, you are. First on that list is Marcus Chaplin.
look, maybe you don't want to lead, and maybe you just don't want to lead this way.
I sure as hell can't fault you for that, but this is gonna happen.
so let me talk to him. Let me talk to the Captain then.
more talk isn't getting anybody home.
then time, COB. I need more time then.
you got four hours, XO. Make 'em count.
half these things don't even have labels.
and I can't read half of them anyway.
at least the tide's coming in now.
listen...
I'm concerned about the Captainand the decisions he's been making lately.
I think we need to do something.
you were on board when he fired on the Patrick Lawrence, yes?
he was protecting the supply ship.
but if you hadn't intervened, would Marcus Chaplinhave killed everyone on board of a US Navy vesselto protect a Chinese supply ship?
the US was trying to starve us, kill us.
he didn't have a choice. - Surrender is a choice.
going home and facing the music, it's a choice.
article 10-88 provides forthe relief of a commanding officerby a subordinate
you're talking about mutiny.
grace, we are on a bad course, heading into dangerous water here.
well, it's still mutiny, and...
it's the Captain.
I know. But I don't see another option.
do you?
Oh, excuse me, miss. I think you dropped this. - Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
that's my lucky $2 bill. I'm gonna need that back.
hopper, what are you doing here? - I found Forrest.
she's dead. Traffic accident.
accident" accident or murder accident?
not sure, but I thought you'd want to knowbefore going inside.
what if I get in there, and they're all just waiting for me?
badge. - Oh, yeah.
I...I must have left it in my overcoat.
I'm...So I'll see you later.
wait.

sweet, sweet salon across the border, we still sing your song, like my mother, forever home and we pray, we pray, oh - You seen King? - My friend, smile.
there's going to be a party.
get in. - I'll drive.
in a few hours, an attempt will be made to remove President Bolton from office.
what do you mean?
a coup, led by Admiral Shepard and others, intends to depose the President, making it possible for me to surrender the Coloradoand for us all to go back home.
where are you getting this?
I spoke to Admiral Shepard this morning. - Admiral Shepard?
and what if it's another trick, Marcus, huh, another government trap, what then?
I don't believe it is.
you know, we got real problems going on here, right here, right now.
I don't think it's that wise to be pinning all our hopeson some pipe dream.
do you?
I know what Prosser and Hawkes are up to.
what are you up to, Sam?
what I'm asking for is a few hoursbefore you condemn me, too.
these last ones are crap.
let's just forget 'em.
those guns are fine pieces of American craftsmanship.
it's the idiot who doesn't know how to strip it or ship itthat's the problem.
why don't you just worry about your own load, shakes?
should I try that with my weapon?
break it down and do it right.
we need every weapon we got.
well, now ain't that cozy?
you fellas going steady again? - It's not what you think.
prove it. - I need more time.
forget it. That song done played already. - I'm in. I'm in.
I just-- I-I need to secure the right people. I need to secure the sub.
if we don't have the Colorado, it's not gonna happen.
ball drops in two hours, peanut.
you try to cross me or turn rat in any way,
I will loose the wolves on you.
and it will get real, real messyreal fast.
okay. Thank you.
Hey, King. I've been looking for you. I need your help.
right now? I kinda got a date. - Hey, hey, it's important. Here.
take this. If something should happen to both me and the Captain,
I need to make sure the people on this listdon't take control of the Colorado.
make sure how?
your COB's the first name on here, Sam.
if this goes the way I want it to, you can tear that up. - And if it doesn't?
if it doesn't, I need someone I can trustthat's gonna look after the ship and the crew.
if you're not that person, you say it now.
Yeah.
Sellicks Beach. It's in Southern Australia. You'll like it.
steep cliffs dropping down to big white sandy beaches.
lots of boats. Good fishing. Plenty for you to do.
it sounds great. Really nice.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
there's just a lot going on here, and XO wants me to make sure that
it's okay. I understand. I'll wait. - It's about to get bad here, Tani.
really bad. I don't want you to be a part of it.
I'll go inland to my father's with my brother, wait till it's over.
It'snever over, okay? Not for me.
then leave with me. - Look, you don't understand who you're talking to.
I'm not the guy you go tofor the dream life on a white sandy beach.
I'm the guy you go to when you need a throat cut.
so take your brother and go.
what the hell happened?
you said you wanted to go with me.
now I'm saying I'll stay with you. - Yeah, that won't work.
I'm not gonna just leave you here. - Why not?
I left you.
Yeah. I slept with Grace the second your back was turned.
now if you think that's worth staying for, you're a hell of a lot more desperate than I thought.
I'm an idiot. What the hell was I thinking?
enter.
sir. Petty Officer Cortez informed meyou needed your summer whites.
thank you, Lieutenant. Anywhere is fine.
you're a lot closer to your academy days than I am.
you still have your reef points memorized?
I'm trying to recall the John Paul Jones quoteon the qualities of an officer.
I can find out. - I know how it starts.
I'm just trying to work through how it ends.
Yes, Sir. - Wait.
the XO...
does he seem like himself these days? - Yes, Sir.
He...yes.
I bring you blindfoldedto the edge of a cliff, Lieutenant, and I tell you to jump, that it'll be okay and you won't be hurt.
I'd jump then, Sir. - You can feel the wind on your face.
you can hear the roar of the ocean below.
your senses tell you that you're on the edge of a cliff.
I trust you, Sir, with my life. - Why?
I haven't always trusted you.
your cross to bear, Sir. - "He should not be blind.
qualities of an officer. Just found it.
he should not be blindto a single fault in any subordinate, though at the same time, he should be quick and unfailingto distinguish error from malice, thoughtlessness from incompetency, and well-meant shortcoming from heedless or stupid blunder.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to missthe party tonight, Lieutenant.
I've got new orders for you.
petty Officer King.
you got two factionsgearing up for a cockfight on that island.
you got your bet down, Lieutenant?
if anything happens, there isn't gonna be a winner.
you got that right. You ask me, both your Captain and your XO.
are swimming in some choppy waters.
I didn't ask you. Excuse me.
Hey.
now I got a list in my pocket...
of who to take outif things go sideways ugly around here.
I know you didn't ask me, but I'm pretty sure that's murder.
I told you before, I see the right stuff in you.
time's coming when you might have to step upand lead these people.
if it does, I'm with you.
hello. - hi you look really nice.
Merci.
uh, I need to talk to youabout something really important.
if you see anything strange on your monitors, especially concerning the Chinese, - I need you to come talk to me right away. Okay? - Sure.
I mean, before you talk to the Captain.
now you and the Captain...No one believes in anyone any longer.
I know it's a lot to ask, but for now, you need to trust me. - That's the problem here.
everyone wants trust. So many secrets. So many lies.
I wish we could just say what we meanand be honest with each other.
well, believe me, so do I.
I know you're in a lot of pain, but it won't last forever. There's a future.
maybe I'll be part of it.
speaker Buell, sorry.
I just ate some of those. It's disgusting.
dried goji berries. First Lady's idea. She's into... clean foods.
I don't even know what that means.
you have it?
you ready for this?
no. - Me neither. But it is our moment to be brave, Ms. Sinclair.
I'm sure our founding fathers felt the same way. - Yes, Sir.
as George Washington said to his men...before they got in that boat,"Men, get in the boat.
that was supposed to be a joke.
is everything okay? - Of course. Yes.
I'll see you out there.
the Sun and the Moon.
the Moon and the stars.
life and death.
death and resurrection.
the Sun gives us life and light.
the Moon watches over us at night, protects our darker natures.
to the lights, my friends.
to love, to nights, to wickedness...
the little death, la petite mort.
to us, to them...
from me to you.
let's have a good time!
I seem to recall giving you a job.
cob, look, the Captainswitched out all the locks on the weapons, all right?
you got a lot of quit in you, son.
or maybe you're just having second thoughts.
cob.
petty Officer Brannan. - Sir.
dismissed, Brannan.
you're really putting on the dog for 'em, aren't you, Captain?
you do know they eat dogs in China, right?
I know what you're up to do.
no, Sir. You have no idea what I'm up to, Sir.
let me see your arms, Joe.
let me see the holesyou been dumping your life and loyalty into.
my eyes are open and clear, Sir.
you gave me your word that you wouldn't undermine meor sabotage the sub.
and you gave me your word you'd get yourselfand my crew back home. How's that going?
I helped you once to beat addiction, Joe, in Port Zayed.
and I'd help you againif you let me.
rock steady...
sir.
you want to wear the big hat, Joe?
come take it off my head.
for those who said that I was false of heart, that my actions marked me as a traitor,
I ask that in the light of this new day, we set aside recriminations.
I wish nothing more than to return to the land I loveand surrender the Colorado to...
anything yet? - Just regular news so far.
narrator: In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups.
the police who investigate crime, and the district attomeys who prosecute the offenders.
these are their stories.
I had your office try you at home this morning.
you're still asking for a severance.
Yeah. Almost not, given the number of threats my client received this weekend.
Diane, we prepped him for this. He wavers now, we're back where we started.
he's a kid-- just the sight of these two will freeze him.
that's their right. To intimidate him?
we requested separate transport vans.
hopefully this thing'll be short and sweet.
Bailiff: Docket number 9357.
motion to sever defendant Ryan M. Cutrona from co-defendants Howard S. Metzler and Steven B. Hanauer.
why is there a motion to sever in a gang rape case now.
judge: I'd like to get this trial started, people.
the more motions filed on this case, the more press attention it seems to get.
due to an overwhelming amount of evidence against his co-defendants。
what evidence? He's lying. He's got nothing.
he wants to save his own ass.
judge: Order! Don't be stupid, okay? Don't be dead.
order.
we know what you did.
okay, you hear me, Ryan? Judge: Counsel!
judge: I'll have your client detained!
look at me! Do you hear me?
huh? You hear me? !
I want you to know exactly!
wait, Ryan, don't...
guard: Get down, get down!
face to the floor! Do it!
because I can't even get him to sit in a damn chair, much less listen to anything I have to say.
a severance is not going to do your client much good if he's facing the exact same charges.
Oh, for crying-- the kid's terrified.
I offered to lower the charges if he gave me pertinent information.
okay, so where do we stand?
I can prosecute either way, with or without him, but I'd have to guess from what happened in court that he's got something of value.
I'd rather have the truth than not.
Yeah. So let's set it up.
we'll take a run at him.
logan: Howard, how long did you follow her for?
a couple blocks.
did anybody talk about it while you followed her?
we really didn't think he'd go through with it.
Why? Did you talk about it before?
Yeah.
Ryan said he wanted to.
we just thought... we'd set him up, he'd back off, get scared.
that's not true.
logan: Did you touch Ms. DeVries at all?
lawyer: We're clear on that issue, Detective.
my client stated that he only watched.
logan: Did you want to touch her?
Ryan's the one who got off.
Hanauer's is worse.
he says you begged him to help you do someone.
says they even had to stop you during the attack.
I don't want to see it.
it's just more lies.
why don't you fill us in?
I can't.
Ryan, whatever you're holding back must be damning enough to scare them.
they're counting on your fear to protect themselves.
I'll take a lie detector test and prove that I didn't do anything.
that's not enough for what your buddies are telling us.
Ryan, you're accused of raping a woman.
I'm 17.
I don't have a record. You'll be tried as an adult.
any jury that sees those tapes will send you up for a lot more time than your buddies'll do.
you know he didn't run point on this.
I can't prosecute on instincts.
she had bruises on her wrists and ankles.
how many hands do you think my client has?
Lnteresting defense. You plan to out-prosecute me?
where are you going to take this?
I can only work with what I have on hand, and if your client plans to...
martyr himself with a heavier sentence, that's not my problem.
I'll go after the others as hard as I do your client.
DNA tests on the semen samples are due in this afternoon.
we'll talk with you then.
because it's a game to these kids, and I'm sure they were the driving force.
the Cutrona kid's holding something-- I have no idea what it is.
nothing out of the transcripts from the victim?
her recollection has been shaky at best.
she's pretty much repressed the whole event.
she's what, a reporter?
reporter? She does exploitive crap!
all sizzle and no steak.
where is that coming from?
I'm sorry, Adam, but I have to be honest.
I want to put away the scum that raped her, but I don't have to embrace her journalism, her lifestyle, her attitudes.
I don't like her and I don't think a jury'll like her either.
tough case without her on the stand.
I wish that were my only concern.
I feel like we're hitting baseballs in the dark.
we've got enough with the tapes and maybe the circumstantial to put someone away-- probably the wrong kid.
which means that Metzler's and Hanauer's people will ask to be severed from the Cutrona kid because he'll take the fall, then they get suspended or greatly reduced.
or maybe nothing.
no match on the semen sample.
on any of them?
that could solve our entire dilemma. We may be dead in the water.
possibly another assailant?
never mentioned by the others.
she was foggy the first few days on the numbers, but since said it was three.
what about a boyfriend? I'll check.
just a minute.
did she state whether there was penetration during the rape?
she's repressed it.
rape kit findings at the hospital indicate there was.
if there was no discharge during the rape, could be a boyfriend-- previous night, that morning.
well, find out.
either way, we're hurt without a DNA match.
we're thinking of requisitioning you a flak jacket for your birthday.
Yeah, it's all over the precinct.
last I heard he-- what, single-handedly disarmed the kid?
crushed the gun with his bare hands.
Monica DeVries have a boyfriend?
don't know. Why, are you in the market?
how was she in the line-up?
what do you mean?
her confidence.
not good, she wasn't clear. And the perps?
the young kid was a giveaway, nervous.
he'd never been in a line-up.
is this thing unraveling?
there's no DNA match on the semen samples.
come on, that's crap! They bragged about it all over the neighborhood.
we got their confession on tape!
conflicting.
yeah...
still.
so there's no match-- that doesn't mean she wasn't raped.
what are you gonna do?
hope she slept with someone before the attack.
four in the last half hour.
press thinks the case may be slipping away.
how do you think they'd react if they sensed an opportunity to publicly fry one of their own?
meaning what?
advance copy of tomorrow's "Ledger.
this backed up? They know she's got a record.
a five-year-old bust. She was there to research a story.
can't we counter with a statement?
like what? "Everybody past fifth grade should understand relevance"?
reasonable doubt in the mind of a jury, the defense'll run with it.
one drug arrest five years ago.
it's like another lifetime. But now, because it's just on page six,
I can be raped without penalty.
it's not a question of abstract application of the law, Ms. DeVries, it's perception.
we're dealing with the collective minds and morals of a jury.
often, it's just a question of cause and effect.
what was she doing down there? Why was she dressed like that?
and what's her background? Jurors are not computers, these things do have an impact on them.
maybe they'd like to check between my toes for needle marks before they rule.
I'll pass.
I've already been bent over once.
unfortunately, we can no longer prosecute without you on the stand.
you told me you had no problem with me being off the stand, that the drug arrest might cloud the issue.
in a perfect world it would, but your friends in the fourth estate have taken that choice out of our hands.
plus... we didn't get a match on the DNA tests.
what? ! do you have a boyfriend?
someone you might have slept with before the attack?
what the hell does that matter? Does that mean I wasn't raped?
the defense'll probably ask for a blood sample.
from every guy they think I might have had sex with?
Monica, I don't want to diminish the rape, but you're a reporter, try processing the facts.
if it's the system you abhor, make the decision.
do you want these people who violated you to walk uncontested?
no one in this room has the ability to redesign the entire railroad.
so I should just lash myself to the front of the train?
make my peers really happy.
give them a lot to write about.
you think this is enough newsprint dedicated to one rape investigation?
everything but my name-- how polite of them.
there's enough newsprint that if you don't testify, you're sending a dangerous message to the women of this city that a rape victim's chances forjustice are so slim, she might as well not even press charges.
you are a public figure. People do watch what you do.
it's difficult for any woman.
I'd be lying to myself if I thought it was easier for you.
testifying might be the only way to counter this.
"the Post," "The Times,"
everything to "Vanity Fair.
she's right-- everybody's taken a shot.
she's not named, but she's well-known enough so the description does just as much damage.
who provided the most coverage?
post.
you know anyone over there?
one or two people, why?
we need as much background on her as possible.
you think she's still using?
if she is, I'd like to know before the rest of the world does.
thank you.
lunch? Thanks a lot.
look, the bottom line is, nobody's gone too far.
every news source in town has practically lD'd her.
no more than any other rape victim.
well-known investigative reporter for local TV whose oft-criticized style of sensational and exploitive coverage.
listen, man, she's a local minor celebrity, people want to follow the case.
the need to read drives the press to print speculations like a drug habit?
can I put it this way? Nobody I know is afraid of a civil suit for libel.
she says she's clean.
Plus, I talked to her producers-- they verified the assignment.
her producers? What are they going to say?
she's a commodity, man. You think they're going to burn her?
but her peers will?
her peers?
maybe her peers think she got what she deserved.
Why? Because they think she was buying or because they think she's a bitch?
look, I'm not here to make any accusations, but if you listen to what the hallway rumors are, that's what she was down there for.
stone: How many assailants were there, Ms. DeVries?
there were three. And did all three of these men attempt to engage in sexual acts with you on that day?
I think so. You originally told police there may have been as many as five assailants, is that not true?
I was confused-- The hospital reports that you were traumatized, and suffering from trauma-induced amnesia, is that correct?
Yes, that's right. Yet you remember now?
Yes! You remember the day and the time of day?
how warm it was? So warm you wanted to take your jacket off.
you remember the stoop that they forced you under, screaming for help, and begging for mercy?
Yes, that's right. Yet you cannot remember how many men tried to have sex with you? !
that's not the same thing!
did any of these men try have sex with you?
Yes, damn it! Then will you submit to a drug test, Ms. DeVries?
what the hell is going on?
at that point, I'd jump up and yell objection.
and then what would happen?
I'd argue relevance, the defense would state that you were there to buy drugs, or already under the influence of them.
thus your recall or your actions were radically different from what we're stating.
and you would say?
I don't know.
why don't you tell me?
word has it, your habit is not as old as you'd like to think.
I was not high.
okay, that's a start.
were you there to buy drugs?
I was raped.
what the hell difference does it make why I was down there?
it doesn't.
I don't care if you were there to buy a nuclear bomb.
you are not on trial.
but I cannot prosecute effectively if I have to worry what's around every corner.
I asked them if they had any coke for sale.
them-- the boys who raped you?
it was for the story.
to check on availability.
hurts us that she initiated contact.
the defense'll state it could have been a come on.
that's beatable if the jury buys that her request for coke was research.
do you? No.
but I don't have any choice.
it's her memory I'm concerned about now.
her recollection on a lot of the details did feel... co-mingled.
could have been culled from the papers.
Yeah, too good on some, non-existent on others.
she remembered she scratched someone, that her actual memory?
l remember...
clawing at a sweaty face.
police report does not list scratches on any of the accused, and there was no tissue under her fingernails.
and "The Post" and another paper both describe that in portrayal pieces.
she hadn't talked to any reporters.
they took license, did not present as fact, and she latched onto that.
do you think it was a conscious attempt?
my best guess, no.
I'd say she's filling in the blanks, and what better source than news accounts?
it makes her a liability on the stand.
which means we better find out one way or the other.
at this point, she had no recollection of the event at all?
she knew what had happened to her, but only because she had been told.
and she was still in physical pain.
any rule of thumb on how much usually comes back?
it differs case to case.
best hope scenario.
usually the mind will only go so far.
lt'll fill in the areas of information around the assault, but it won't go all the way back into the pain.
Thanks.
if we put her on the stand now, they'll shred us.
I don't know.
the public hears dismissal, they think the case has been dropped.
we'll be editorialized from hell to breakfast.
I'll re-file as soon as something breaks.
Yeah, well, they won't let you finish the sentence.
the press hears dismissal, that's it.
then you tell me what to do.
the judicial calendar has already been announced.
who did you draw? Scanlon.
tough on rape, could have done worse.
Adam, she had poor recall in the mock cross, and her own doctor doubts the details have returned.
that, combined with the drug use rumor.
the fact that she asked about coke, whether it was research or not, puts her in a pretty negative light.
what about the gun charge on Metzler?
criminal possession, third degree, he never even fired it.
he had intent but, with three court officers wrestling for control
that's an "E" felony. would you rather let him walk?
it's his first offense.
they'll plead to a class "A" misdemeanor, he'll walk and then we'll really look desperate.
Whew! We'll hold it.
we'll tack it on the rape if we get it.
all right, you just do me the favor, and you go as fast as you can to re-open.
we'll get Greevey and Logan back on the investigation.
they'll find evidence to open up the Cutrona kid.
it lies with him.
somebody's gotta talk to Monica DeVries.
stone: We go into trial now and we lose, we cannot go after them again ever.
you asked me what I thought the odds were,
I'm giving you a fair assessment.
lt'll be swept into some pending file.
Robinette: Monica, we're not dropping the case.
Oh, and we'll have a better chance two months from now.
hopefully we can go in with more substantive evidence.
what more could you possibly need? They've confessed!
I need you on the stand and I can't put you there.
I agreed, for God's sake.
you don't remember.
what?
you don't remember the events.
your mind has picked up on a mixture of facts and speculation from the news media and blended them together into something that you believe.
but if I put you on the stand, any defense attorney in this city will blow enough holes in that case to bury us.
what matters is that they did it.
Yes, that matters.
but the three of us knowing that in this room is not a substitute for proof.
and I do intend to prove that you were raped by these suspects.
Bailiff: Docket number 9357, motion to dismiss Ryan M. Cutrona.
Mr. Robinette.
your Honor, with respect to the People's motion,
I'd like to reiterate the State's intention to reopen this case on such a date when further evidence is obtained.
otherwise, the People's position is clearly stated in the papers filed earlier.
your comments are so noted, Mr. Robinette.
case number 9357 is dismissed.
defendants are free to go.
I'd just like to get this case back up and running as quickly as possible.
if it sits, we run the risk of it collapsing completely, and this case is not un-winnable.
wait a minute, we gave you enough to prosecute.
we're not the ones who blew this thing.
this is not an assessment of blame. It's a petition to put the case back together.
we've got a victim who's co-mingling fact and fiction, and a defendant who's holding back relevant information.
so how do we get the truth?
you made the motion to dismiss...
you got any ideas?
no, I don't have any ideas! That's why I'm here!
all right, fellas, could we please hold this down to a dull head stomp?
we're thin.
it's obvious they're holding something back.
if we weren't confident you could provide that something for us, we would've taken our shots with the jury.
as for suggestions, I don't have any ideas.
we weren't able to leverage Hanauer, or Metzler, and the younger kid is not forthcoming.
and he's not going to give it up now that the case has been dismissed.
but...
if you guys can find a back door...
well, maybe we press the two older kids work some kind of a play on them.
we'll backtrack through our notes, see what pops up.
all right, three weeks, that's all I can afford with their caseload.
Thanks.
personal effects, Monica DeVries.
she never picked them up.
never will, either. Reminds her too much.
I can't say as I blame her.
mind if I borrow this?
Oh, no, Paul. we have our own.
all right.
they stopped here around 3: 50 in the afternoon.
they forced her down under that stoop.
general disagreement on who said what, blouse was ripped off, jacket pulled up to hold her arms until it rips.
slight shoulder dislocation during struggle.
the-- well, now we get into a big discrepancy as to who was actually on top of her.
er report
multiple attackers.
how many of these buildings did we canvas?
we canvassed both sides.
whole block, came up with nothing.
no witnesses, just a lot of listeners.
it's the post Kitty Genovese era.
no one wants to look, they think they'll get involved.
this building and the one next to it, weren't there a couple of apartments we never got?
Yeah, 1 B, right here.
fifth, sixth and 1 1th.
left notes each time. Upstairs, same thing.
good a place as any.
it's about the rape that happened out front.
woman: I was gone.
upstate at my sister's.
did you hear anything from any of the neighbors about that day?
you still haven't caught them?
logan: Hey, Max, let me get in here.
Yes, ma'am, we have. we're just following up.
we're wondering, did you hear anything since then?
talk, rumors?
I don't go out.
this is as far out in the world as I go without my son.
you better believe I wasn't at home.
20 hours of labor.
besides, I called. I left a message at the number you left.
we never got it.
what a surprise. Ms. Varella, was there any talk in the building about what people heard or saw?
Yeah, there were more people here in one weekend than I've talked to in two years.
how come you only arrested three?
Why? Do you think there was more?
the guy down in "C," Silva, heard the whole thing. Said it was six or seven?
well... wasn't it?
I heard the case was dismissed.
that doesn't mean it's closed.
did you hear the rape, Mr. Silva?
most of it.
although I wasn't sure what was going on.
I mean...this street.
didn't we talk to you? We got a statement down from you.
I said that I was gone.
I was... going through something with a friend of mine.
I didn't want him to know I was here.
you didn't call 911 during the attack?
I wasn't sure at first.
uh...
I know I was wrong not to.
these kids live around here.
you know how much bashing goes on on this block?
besides...
I heard you were making arrests, so...
how many people did you hear?
I thought I might have heard...five.
l, uh-- l-l.
I guess I might have heard three.
I tell you, it's more of a mess now than it was two months ago.
people don't knowwhat they heard, what they saw, what they didn't see, what they heard on the news, what they heard on the street, in the newspapers.
maybe we'll get a guy down here with a gold watch, hypnotizes the whole neighborhood?
what?
why don't we take a legitimate shot with the vic?
come on, Mike, It's a weak case as is.
you know how the courts stand on that. Hit and miss at best.
no, no, no. I'm not saying we provide them with hypnotically-induced testimony.
no, we'll use it for investigation only.
talk to the DA.
Robinette: They don't always toss it, but they have been uneven in accepting aided testimony.
I know that. That's not what we're asking.
look, we're up against a wall here.
I don't want to put her under, have a new investigatory line pop, then have the courts tell you guys we can't use it.
it's a good idea-- try it, but if anything new surfaces during the session, we've got to link it to something substantive down the line.
as testimony, I'd rather not use it at all, unless it's extremely compelling.
we'll let you know.
we got bad news.
it's the tox report.
she left a brush and some other effects with the police after the rape.
the hair tested positive, but we can probably counter it.
it doesn't mean she was using on that day.
Paul, you made a serious mistake here.
you ordered a lab test on what basis?
it's for our knowledge only.
I don't want to prosecute her on it.
what about her right to privacy?
wait a minute.
this is one of your biggest concerns.
let's find out before the rest of the world does.
that is over the line.
you mean to tell me it's more important that we maintain some myth of blind justice, walk into court and get our butts kicked?
you'd rather not know.
not if it means circumventing a basic guaranteed right of the people.
what about the Supreme Court's stand on blind drug testing-- mandatory in certain job classifications?
not mandatory when you're raped.
MONICA: ..."It's a party, " and they started to laugh.
doctor: When they ask where you were going, do you look at their faces?
MONICA: I think if I look right at them, they'll stop harassing me.
what do their faces look like?
they're young.
late teens, early 20s.
the youngest looks frightened.
the others are bigger.
they seem older.
which one is the most...intimidating?
the oldest.
he doesn't have any life in his eyes.
I know he's the most dangerous.
he doesn't care that I'm afraid.
he's not excited by it.
not like the other three.
they're there for him.
Monica, let's back up for a second.
when you were describing the boys, did you mean to describe three or four to me?
four.
are you sure?
you're sure?
Yes.
now I'm going to ask you to relax even further.
remember, these are only memories.
they cannot hurt you.
this fourth boy, who is the oldest, focus in on him, and tell me about his face.
gaunt.
drawn.
looks that might once have been good-looking.
he has green eyes.
he has a scar over his right eye.
his skin is pale.
his hair looks unwashed.
did you, at any time during the attack, hear his name used?
we know there was a fourth guy.
we know he committed the majority of the rape.
we got his first name. I say we use it against the other three.
one of them's bound to collapse.
it would only tip our hand.
something in here has got to lead to him.
she told us who did what, who held her, who performed what acts, the fact that he tried to get her to fellate him, the threats to slash her face.
we got everything we need except the fourth guy.
we pick him up, we get a blood test to match on the semen sample, it's a slam dunk-- the other three go down with him.
fine, let's go pick him up. His name's Tim.
come on, Max, you know what the hell I'm talking about.
all right, you want to make a move?
let's check the stoop for glass.
what? !
she remembered them breaking a bottle, threatening to slash her face, right?
two months later you think we're going to find anything?
when's the last time you swept under your stoop?
Ugh, this is making me nauseous.
gee, that's funny, Max. You ought to come down here.
I was thinking of puking just to improve the smell.
OOP, more glass!
okay, send it up.
remind me never to eat at your house.
they're perfectly good tongs, you think I'm going to throw them away?
you got a couple of partials, third and fourth fingerprints on one of the fragments,
I think it's a bottleneck.
run a crosscheck on every set we got, first name Tim, Timothy
do all the "T's" just to be safe.
it's going to take some time.
Hey, do I look like I'm in a hurry?
three assaults, two narco pops, one sale weight, partial matches on middle and ring finger.
great. It's not enough-- they're only partial matches.
there's at least 35 other possible match ups here.
logan: He lives two blocks from the scene.
he's been popped for dealing.
narcotics says Metzler and Hanauer have been running for him for months!
fine. The prints place him at the scene, not the time, of the attack.
we pop him, he'll match on the DNA.
and what if he doesn't? There's no sex offenses here. What do we hold him on?
I don't know. This guy fits.
Tulli down in narcotics says he'd gut his mother for a nickel.
the Cutrona kid's probably scared to death.
look, guys, do I have to speak slowly here?
Yes, I think he's our guy.
Yes, I would like to pop him, but this thing has been dismissed once already.
we cannot go off half-cocked. We need more.
like what?
like... testimony from the Cutrona kid.
a statement, anything.
we'll give him a run.
good, Mike, because...
I don't think he's gonna come waltzing in here on his own!
logan: we know he was there.
we need you to testify against him.
you do that, the DA will reduce the rape charges against you.
how far? You'd have to talk to Stone, but he assured me... no time.
what about working for Pruiting?
you're not up on the drug charges.
the hope is you clean that up by yourself.
he said he'd kill me.
MAX: You let us worry about that.
the truth is, he's a punk.
he's not going to last long in prison.
you'd be the least of his problems.
he'll testify.
police, Mr. Pruiting. You're under arrest.
hold it!
get off of me, man! You're charged with rape and assault.
you have the right to remain silent-- Freeze!
those little bastards ratted on me, man.
I'm not going down alone!
you hear me! You think I'm lying?
those little jerks were with me when we did it.
I want those little humps! Put something on.
little punks'll say whatever you want to hear! Logan: Yeah, yeah.
what the hell's going on?
when was he Mirandized at the bust?
Hey, that's crap if he's saying he wasn't Mirandized.
I read 'em as we were taking him out.
after he made the statements.
are you gonna tell us about our day?
sounds like spontaneous declaration to me.
fine, it'll fall into "For what it's worth," and I'll bury it.
I'll be with my client. Let's not have this take all day.
look,
I started during his statements.
the guy was screaming like crazy, then the girl made a move.
I re-read them after everything calmed down.
Hey, this guy was out of his mind high, he was blurting things out left and right.
it doesn't matter. I'll make it admissible.
Taggert'll take the wind out of it.
the statements may be too vague to help us anyway.
so why aren't we asking for a blood sample?
because we have a problem.
Oh?
you can't subpoena blood samples if you have nothing to match it against.
forensics seems to have...misplaced the rape samples.
what? ! !
this is unbelievable.
they're continuing to look, but my guess is some idiot saw the paperwork come through on the dismissal and out they went.
that's incredible.
which leaves us with not much.
what do you want to do?
stone: That's what we're here to decide.
I can't justify much longer detaining Pruiting to his lawyers.
even with the Cutrona kid's statement?
that's an uncorroborated statement from an accomplice.
we need something to back that up with.
how long can you justify holding him?
duck a couple of phone calls from his attorney.
after that...
after that, you lose the paperwork.
Max, what is this?
last shot-- get Metzler and Hanauer to roll.
we got no leverage-- what the hell is going on?
Max, no deals. I want the other two as much as Pruiting.
MAX: Look at those mooks, still selling crack.
gentlemen.
if this is a roust, you've got no cause.
you think we need cause, ant brain?
you think we don't know how to move vials, huh?
Hey, Mike. Come on.
no roust, no charges, no interrogation.
you just come in, make some statements, we listen-- Listen to what?
your version of what happened.
since Tim Pruiting's been in all day screaming that he didn't rape Monica DeVries. what?
he says it was you guys.
you're full of it.
watch your mouth.
you think I pulled that name out of thin air?
you want me to describe his place?
in fact, we can drop by. I'll show you what a mess we made during the bust.
is he saying we did her? That's a load.
Hey, you don't have to convince us, we know he did her...
but we gotta pop somebody for it.
it's bull!
you want us to roll.
we already arrested him, genius.
we don't need you to incriminate him.
so we're not under arrest?
absolutely not.
unless...
he convinces us that he's right.
it can't be used against us?
that's the deal.
tell you what.
I'll make it really easy.
I'll call Legal Aid.
they'll set up a room.
you come in, in and out, no hanging around. Give me a quarter.
what? Give me a quarter.
what are you doing?
huh?
Hey, that's great, Max. Nowwe got even more unusable statements.
think so? Who you calling?
think they have a reasonable expectation of privacy right now.
Hi, honey, it's me.
I'll probably be late tonight.
you're out of your mind, you know that?
stone's going to blow a fuse over this and Cragen'll strap us to our desks forever.
wrong, Detective.
they are not under arrest.
Oooh.
Hanauer's voice: Because if he is, I'm not taking the fall, and neither should you. We didn't do her. He got off on it.
Metzler: What's all this crap about keeping our mouth 's shut?
he tells us they got no evidence 'cause he's the only one who'll match the load, and he gets picked up and rolls? Screw him!
look, we know what we did, we just tell it straight.
all we did was hold her, maybe some other stupid stuff, but we 're not riding down for Pruiting.
all right, so it's damning.
do I have to run a list here, Stone?
Miranda, Bartolameo, the Supreme Court's Minnick decision.
the whole thing's illegally obtained.
they were both represented by counsel.
not for the past two months, they weren't.
there were no charges pending. There was no accusatory instrument pending, no outstanding indictment. You know as well as I do that Minnick provides nothing new in New York.
what about their privacy?
the court's stance on the expectation of privacy is fairly clear.
please! They were sitting in a cop car.
with the doors wide open, in the middle of the day, in a city street.
you think there's a greater expectation of privacy there than on a cordless phone?
and I'm sure you know the court's stance on that.
it's debatable.
that's not debatable, that's precedent.
and that's what I'm going into court with.
you did good work.
make sure it doesn't get thrown out of court.
I can't be sure of anything, but I do know what I believe in, and I believe you didn't violate the system.
want to re-arrest Hanauer and Metzler?
Absolutely. No bargains. The charge is rape.
we'll let their defense attorneys figure out if they want to sever or not.
I'm sure they know the procedure by now.
what do you want to do with the Cutrona kid?
him we need. Paul's going to bring him in for a statement.
I can use that instead of the DNA match.
well, our boy Pruiting just tried to sell everyone he knows during booking
crack dealers, peepers。
all in the hopes of landing a deal.
hell of a guy.
quite a piece of work.
in the coming days, you will hear arguments on whether three men in this courtroom are guilty of the crime of rape.
you will then be asked to decide two things:
the fate of the defendants, and more indirectly the fate of a legal system.
a system that is too often circumvented and mocked by those who seek to escape the weight of justice.
a system which can be used by the defense to put a woman, violated against her will, on trial...
for anything ranging from how she was dressed to why she was in a particular neighborhood.
it is the State's position that there are no valid reasons to justify violent sexual behavior against another person's will.
it is my job to present these facts to you and hope that you will agree with the State's position.
it is your job to listen.
to listen how, through willful intimidation, and a moderate knowledge of the legal system, these three men chose to flaunt their crime of rape
in the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous.
in New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit.
these are their stories.
when did you know Janey and Connor were missing?
we were just learning about the Q-ball on Apollo spacecraft and how it is held together by the rubber band.
when miss Phillips said it was time to go.
so we lined up to hand back our museum recorders and Connor and Janey were just gone.
they didn't even say good-bye.
that's so rude.
did you see Janey and Connor talking to any grown-ups?
just to miss Phillips. She's our teacher.
are Janey and Connor friends?
well, Connor has a crush on her.
and he always sticks up for her when she gets picked on.
who picks on her?
I do not pick on Janey.
she made fun of me because I said "epi-tomey" instead of epitome.
so I pushed her into her locker.
you push her into anything today?
even if I wanted to, I couldn't have.
she was being escorted by her personal bodyguard.
you mean Connor.
could they have run off together?
Connor's psycho enough.
no one else hangs out with Janey. - Why not?
cause she's a freak.
kids her own age don't want anything to do with her.
aren't Janey and Connor the same age?
no, Connor's 13 and Janey's 17.
she sure doesn't look it.
Janey has a genetic disorder called Turner syndrome.
that's why she looks so young.
why are they in the same class? - They're not.
we're a small prep school for gifted children, so the honors clubs takes seventh graders to seniors.
did you notice anyone suspicious around Janey or Connor?
I, I didn't.
God, help me.
when did you notice they were missing?
not until the curator told me that they hadn't returned their cassette players.
that's why he still had their IDs.
sign-out sheet says Janey has cassette player number 159.
Connor has 160.
people walk off with these things all the time.
so the museum installed a tracking device into each one.
you can even set it to find a specific player.
what range? - 500 yards.
159 is out of range.
160's somewhere nearby.
CSU is on it.
okay, signal's coming from behind the fence.
don't see any security cameras.
only the ones inside watching the collections.
all right, it's in the bushes.
here we go.
number 160. - That's Connor's.
hold up.
Connor Wesley. - There's blood on the laces.
kid must've fought back.
Connor's father just got a ransom call for $300.
for two kids? What is that, some kind of joke?
caller sounded young. He wants the money dropped off at a video arcade.
says he's got a gun.
if the money's not there in an hour, he's gonna use it.
law & Order SVU 8x02. Clock
original AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/09/26
what did you find out?
TARU's in place on the Connor family phone.
the kidnappers haven't contacted Janey's parents yet.
but the father's on a plane to Vancouver.
what time did the flight leave? - 11: 15.
we're checking the flight manifest.
anything yet? - Negative.
money's still there.
I got a possible here. White male, about 5 foot 5.
he's got blue jeans and green fatigues.
warmer.
we got a bite.
police!
where you going, pal?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
is this your lunch?
what's this, bologna?
a guy said he'd pay me 50 bucks to pick up the bag.
all right, delivery boy. Where you taking it?
I promised to keep my mouth shut.
maybe a little jail will help you open it up.
Jake Taylor. 556 West 112th st.
cathedral parkway exit off Riverside is the quickest route. I swear.
police! Get your hands in the air! Where's the gun?
what gun? / The gun you said you were gonna use on Connor over there.
I made it up.
you scamming us, Connor?
Yes, sir.
how'd the blood get on your shoe?
I squeezed a raw steak on it. So you'd think I got hurt.
anyone else here?
Where's Janey?
who's Janey?
I'm gonna let you boys in on a little secret here.
filing a false kidnapping report, that's five years in prison.
stop jerking us around. Where is she?
who called in the ransom?
I did. But it was Connor's idea.
I lost 300 bucks betting on baseball.
this was the only way my dad would give me...
Where's Janey?
she, she stayed at the museum.
no, she didn't. Janey's gone.
when's the last time you saw her? - When I split.
she made sure Miss Phillips wasn't looking, gave me the signal to go.
look, you cooked up this phony kidnap scheme to squeeze your old man for money.
why'd Janey run away? - I don't know.
she have problems at home? - No.
her dad's real cool. Loaded too.
owns all these hotels. Gave her anything she wanted.
what about her mother? - Never met her.
she took off when Janey was little.
listen. Something made Janey run.
they tell me you're her bodyguard. What does she need one of those for?
Janey gets picked on.
by who? - Everyone.
they think she's a geek.
when she ran for student council president, they booed at her so bad, she had to skip school for a week.
so if I'm elected to the student council, I'm gonna make really big changes.
I've got cool ideas.
like what?
like making it okay to go off-campus for lunch.
we already do that.
but it's against the rules, and it shouldn't be.
they should treat us like adults.
and electing a little girl is gonna get them to do that?
principal said they were pretty rough on her.
girls with Turner syndrome are incredibly bright.
but they can have trouble connecting with kids their own age because they don't go through the same stages of puberty.
and they don't look their age.
these girls often don't grow breasts, they rarely get their periods, and they usually don't grow to be taller than a ten year-old.
Janey's a 17-year-old trapped in a child's body.
which could be dangerous for her.
she looks like a little kid, wandering the streets alone.
a pervert's walking fantasy.
the Amber alert is out.
I'll have Munch ride TARU on the museum security camera tapes.
Elliot, you head over to Janey's house.
father home yet?
no, he's on his way. But the grandfather's home.
I'll take Fin.
Hey, Elliot.
FYI, chief of D's called. They're working on a new partner for you.
no, I'm fine with Munch and Fin until Olivia gets back.
well, that may take a while.
what are you doing here? Is everything all right?
I need to talk to you.
a couple days ago, you were never gonna speak to me again.
you really screwed up things between me and Kevin.
good. I don't want you to see him again.
it's not your decision. I love him.
what do you mean you love him? You're 17 years old.
so I can't love anyone?
look, you're too young to be serious with anyone.
mom says you're overreacting.
well, I'll talk to your mother about that later.
now you're gonna be late for school. Wait here. I'm gonna drive you.
Hey, Kathleen?
I hate you!
everything okay?
man, you're lucky you don't have daughters.
Cragen wants us to interview Janey's family.
this way, detectives.
I'm Tate Speer, Janey's grandfather.
have you got anything? - Not yet.
this is all my fault.
I should never have let Janey take that school trip.
you often keep Janey out of school functions?
she's delicate, requires constant supervision.
but you let her go today.
she begged me. And she loves museums.
they're usually safe, aren't they?
now some sick son-of-a-bitch has taken her.
we're gonna need to see her bedroom.
there's quite a few plaques here, awards.
looks like she's a smart kid.
she loves science and math.
she makes better grades than most of the boys in her class.
she have a boyfriend?
she's only a child.
any boys call or come over?
Mr. Speer, is there a reason Janey might've run away?
problems at home maybe?
no. Absolutely not.
my granddaughter is happy.
she was kidnapped.
where were you this morning, sir?
I was here with my staff. Do you want to question them, hmm?
we will. / What about your business? You have any enemies?
anybody who'd like to hurt you or your son financially?
we laid off some people about a month ago renovating one of our hotels.
everyone got a nice severance package.
and Janey's mom?
that drunk. She walked away from Janey when she was five.
we don't talk about her in this house.
wait, what are you doing with that?
a lot of kidnappings start in internet chat rooms.
Janey might've met someone online.
I seriously doubt it. We only allow her ten minutes a day on-line.
still, it's best if we let one of our techs take a look at it.
that was Munch. TARU called. They found something.
this is what we got off the museum security tapes.
if you look at the screen near the rear door, you'll see Connor make his exit.
what about the girl?
patience, my friend. 10: 05 A. M.
Janey's left the main group.
gets approached by a stranger. Watch.
the woman offers her something.
whatever it is, Janey took it.
and goes with her.
that's all. - No, it's not.
what is that, a logo? - Yep.
I enlarged it, cleaned it up.
there.
that's her.
MAIA, I'm detective Stabler.
were you at the Manhattan science museum this morning?
Nathan sent you, didn't he?
Janey's father.
Oh, you know Janey.
I'm her mother.
where is she? - At school.
isn't she?
why are you here? Has something happened to her?
you tell us. - No.
what's happened to her?
just come with us, lady. - What's he done to her?
what's the bastard done to my baby?
he's taken her. He's taken her, hasn't he?
I swear. I don't know where Janey is.
why were you at the museum?
she asked me to meet her.
she said she needed baby pictures for some school project.
the way it looks on the security camera,
Janey wasn't too happy to see you.
Nathan must've taken her.
it's just the type of sneaky, underhanded trick he'd pull.
well, he's halfway to Vancouver right now, and the flight record shows Janey's not with him.
so let's try again, okay?
well, then he must've paid someone to take her.
why would he? She lives with him.
because two months ago, I filed for joint custody.
how long have you been out of your kid's life?
12 years. / 12 years. Now all of a sudden, you want back in just like that?
not just like that.
three years ago, I got sober.
I asked Nathan to give me another chance.
he said that Janey had forgotten me.
so he's a jerk.
it still doesn't make any sense for him to snatch her.
last week, Janey told the judge she wanted to live with me.
the judge makes his decision next week.
you don't think Nathan would do this?
ask him why he took Janey to Vancouver last month to look at schools.
ask him why he made her promise not to tell me.
detectives.
we got a hit off the Amber alert.
a woman thinks she saw a girl matching Janey's description being pushed into a silver Lexus SUV at 87th and central park west.
three blocks from the museum. What time? / 10: 30.
you got a description of the driver?
male and tall.
but check out the family vehicle.
silver Lexus SUV.
who had the car this morning?
Greg Hartley drove it to school with Janey and uh,
he's Nathan's assistant.
he drives Janey most days.
Greg, these detectives wanna ask you a question.
after you dropped Janey off today, what'd you do with the car?
brought it back. I've been working here all day.
you didn't run any errands? - No.
Where's the car right now? - In the garage.
not like we have the only Lexus suv in Manhattan.
we gotta start somewhere.
there. Right where it's been all day.
well, why don't... we make sure of that?
10: 10, camera seven. Silver Lexus still in its spot.
fast forward.
who's that?
a guy getting into the Lexus. Do you know him?
not from behind, no.
fast forward.
pause it right there.
now do you recognize him?
never seen him before, no.
what's he doing in your car? How'd he get the keys?
not from me. The key's been in this box since Greg gave them to me this morning.
let's find out when that car came back here.
car's back, and our mystery man is gone.
12: 25. Plenty of time to take Janey, bring the car back, and cover his tracks.
we're gonna need that tape.
crime scene unit will come down here and go over the Lexus.
it's the lab.
Janey's backpack.
found it in a dumpster two blocks from the museum along with her museum cassette.
changed her clothes. Any prints?
at least twenty sets.
take time to go through them.
but I found something else.
a broken drug capsule in the bottom of the backpack.
had some kind of gel in it.
I asked Dr. Warner to take a look.
I analyzed the gel.
mainly ethanol and water.
the only active ingredient is testosterone.
what's she doing with that?
I traced the lot code and made some calls.
the gel's being used in an experimental study on women with pituitary problems.
not on the market yet. - Who's doing the study?
one Dr. Alexander Shulman.
if it's okay with you, I'd like to tag along.
find out how a 17-year-old girl gets her hands on this stuff.
I'm running a clinical trial on women with short stature.
but I'm also doing a side study on girls with Turner syndrome.
does that include Janey Speer?
she was one of my first volunteers.
how does the gel help girls with Turner's?
same way it does those with pituitary problems.
builds bone and muscle mass and increases libido.
wait a minute. You're trying to increase the sex drive of girls who look like kids?
women with Turner's get their periods late and menopause early.
so they have very little time to have a normal sex life.
I'm just trying to help them.
was Janey sexually active?
I can't divulge personal information.
well, let's see what your funders say when they find out you've been testing your medication on underage girls without parental consent.
Janey Speer's file with a parental consent form.
it's signed by her mother.
Yes, I took Janey to Dr. Shulman. But only because she wanted to go.
Janey's dad know?
no. He'd freak out. - I'll bet he would.
how about the judge in your custody case? Does he know?
you can't tell him.
Janey did that for herself.
she's very strong-willed.
what does that mean? You're the parent. You're in charge.
have you got kids?
that's none of your business.
you have.
wait and see what happens if you get pushed out of their lives.
see how much influence you have then.
let's get one thing straight.
you weren't pushed out of Janey's life. You left.
and I'll never forgive myself.
when I found that Janey had Turner's,
I couldn't cope. I ran away.
but I am sober now. And I am trying to get to know my daughter.
by hot-wiring her libido?
kids experiment, especially bright kids like Janey.
I'm only trying to create a safe environment for her to do so.
Nathan still thinks she's 12 years old.
she looks 12 years old. He's trying to protect her.
typical father.
you'd rather lock your daughter up in a convent than admit that she's a woman.
Janey is not a child.
I am trying to show her the real world.
has she shown any interest in boys lately?
she never has her head out of a book long enough to notice them.
even when she's here, she prefers to surf on my computer.
she uses your laptop?
Nathan has some stupid rule not allowing more than ten minutes a day on-line.
I'm gonna need to take that.
do you think she met someone on the computer?
you're the one who wanted to introduce her to the real world.
do you know this man?
no, I've never seen him before. Did he take Janey?
I don't know.
but I'll keep you posted.
Maia's computer answered a lot of questions.
Janey's home laptop was clean, but she'd been using terminal services.
you mean she was running another computer through her own.
she's a smart kid.
used remote desktop on her computer to operate Maia's.
so every website she visited, every person she talked to on-line was registered to Maia's computer, not her own.
so where was this little brainchild going on-line?
some not very childish places.
RedlightManual. com learn the tricks of love. Make him your sex slave forever.
lingerie.
that sex drive gel was working overtime.
what else you got?
maps of the museum.
and emails between her and Connor Wesley two days before they both disappeared.
Janey to Connor. "You wanna make it look real,
so you have to leave something with blood on it."
otherwise, they'll just think you ran away.
any chat rooms?
none, but the last couple of weeks, she visited a service-offered site.
Forgoodcompany. Com.
was she looking for a gigolo?
no, but she got chatting with a Dan O'Schell.
did she arrange to meet him?
he gave her the number at Old Whiskey's pub where he's a bar back.
that's our guy.
yo, Danny. I gotta talk to you a minute. Come here.
wait in line.
what the hell are you doing?
Where's Janey Speer? - Who?
remember now? - That weird kid?
I picked her up on 87th and dropped her off in Battery park.
where in Battery park? - Corner of west Thames and south end.
she meet anyone? - No. Just walked away.
you used her dad's car. Where'd you get the keys?
she mailed me the key. Told me where the car was.
so you just picked up this girl and dropped her off downtown.
why would you do that? - She paid me. 200 bucks.
I haven't even spent it yet. There's the key.
she didn't tell me what to do with it.
that's a strange story, Dan. Why should we believe you?
she hired me. I wished I never would've met her.
who is this girl?
Janey helped Connor set up his fake kidnapping.
she hired a stranger to drive her across town.
she had her mom bring baby photos to the museum like she was leaving home for good.
she visited websites advertising sex positions and lingerie.
not to mention juicing on testosterone.
what's she up to, doc?
it goes way beyond the normal teenage curiosity about sex.
has she been to any chat rooms or met anyone online?
not that we've seen. But she could've met someone in one of her dad's hotels.
family keeps her on a pretty short leash.
it's hard to see how any stranger could get close enough.
but what kind a guy wants to have sex with a girl who looks 12 apart from a pedophile?
it might look like she planned it.
but I think she's being manipulated by someone who wants to mold her into his ideal sex object.
Yeah, a child he can have sex with legally.
so who's Janey's svengali?
start at home. Which man is she closest to?
dad, grandpa. - She's the only female in the house.
and grandpa's wound a little bit too tight.
he freaked out when we touched Janey's computer.
but if he's already got her, why the elaborate vanishing act?
stabler. - Maybe she was gonna tell the truth.
he panicked. He set up the kidnap.
got enough money have somebody squirrel her away somewhere.
cops picked up Janey's father at Kennedy. They're bringing him straight here.
present him with the evidence. See what he's got to say.
why not throw mom into the mix?
parents in the middle of a custody battle get so furious with each other.
they sometimes say more than they intend.
brought your lawyer, Mr. Speer?
I arranged to meet him here.
to offer moral support. My client is extremely upset.
seven hours stuck on a plane.
all I could do was think how Janey must be suffering.
do you know anything yet?
we have evidence Janey ran away to meet someone.
we found these websites on her laptop.
can you help us with it?
Janey would never visit these sites.
they must've popped up when she was researching something else.
like how to get testosterone?
what? - To increase her sex drive.
she must've introduced Janey to this trash.
do you have any proof of that?
Janey was happy, living in a loving home.
then three years ago, her mother, who deserts her when she was five, waltzes back in and demands to be a parent again.
ever since, Janey's been depressed and agitated.
now I see why.
was it true that Janey told the judge she wanted to live with her mother?
Maia manipulated Janey into saying that.
all I'm saying is if my ex breezed back in looking for custody of my kids after I did all the work,
I wouldn't be waiting around for some bogus decision by a judge, especially if I had money and a place like Canada to run away to.
this is preposterous. Are you accusing my client...
I thought you were only here for moral support.
Mr. Speer, I need you to be honest with yourself.
why is Janey itching to get away from you?
you son of a bitch. - That's it. We're leaving.
Nathan? Where is she?
you tell me.
I'm not the one hiding behind a lawyer.
you took her. God help us if this judge leaves her with you.
at least she won't become a drunken slob.
the only reason I got drunk was because you cared more about your damn hotels than me or your daughter! / You drank 'cause you couldn't face your own child.
you ran away.
well, I'm back. And I'm gonna stop you from smothering her.
how? By giving her drugs to have sex?
Oh, screw you, Nathan. - Has the booze rotted your brain?
no, screw you! - Okay, you all...
I am the only parent in Janey's life, and you are never getting custody of her.
where are you hiding her?
you bastard! - Easy, easy, easy!
interesting that Nathan brought his lawyer with him.
I know Van Allen. He's an immigration specialist.
he often handles custody cases where one parent is a foreigner.
so he would be really helpful if a parent wanted to remove his child to Canada.
and if Nathan moved Janey while she's the subject of an ongoing custody case, he's guilty of custodial interference and parental kidnapping.
and Van Allen knows that.
the way Van Allen's behaving it's like he thinks Nathan did it.
he's probably afraid of being implicated himself.
he should be. I've been checking the Speer family LUDs.
over the last few days, there've been a half a dozen calls to an Annabelle Paz.
who is she? - A travel agent.
I remember the calls because they came in early, usually from Mr. Speer's car on his way to work.
where was he looking to go?
somewhere warm. The Caribbean.
I suggested Hawaii, but he was only interested in islands under French or British jurisdiction.
planning a long trip? - Didn't say.
but he wanted open tickets.
tickets plural? - Yes, for him and his daughter.
they came in a couple days ago looking to purchase.
did he get them?
no, I think he was a little put off by the price.
Why? That family's loaded.
dad said he wanted to pay cash.
now, uh. Is that the little girl?
Yeah, that's her. Sweet little thing. Obviously loved her dad.
is her dad in the photo?
Yeah, that's him.
that's the guy who came in with her?
Yeah, that's Mr. Speer.
no, that's Mr. Speer's assistant.
Where's Greg Hartley? - He left.
he never said anything to me. Is he involved in this in some way?
how often was Greg left alone with Janey?
drives her to school ever day, takes her to her music lessons.
Oh, my god. You're not... - Where'd he go?
he said he was feeling sick. I guess he went home.
clear.
clear.
he's gone. He was right under our noses the entire time.
under the Speers' nose too.
check this out.
boots. Paint, plaster. Some still fresh.
I thought he worked in the office.
this boot has something shiny on it.
crime lab needs to take a closer look.
Yeah, and we'll take a closer look at Greg Hartley.
no hit off Greg's prints.
anything off his financials?
Mr. Hartley doesn't own any property. He spends all his time at work.
credit cards and LUDs offer no clues.
lab got something off his boots.
that shiny stuff was marble dust, a real pricey travertine imported from Italy.
how does that help us? - I called grandpa Speer.
they're renovating one of their hotels downtown.
the foyer's gonna have a nice new marble floor.
hotel closed during renovations? - Yep.
what the hell did he do to her?
we need a bus. 235 Church street.
we got a 17-year-old, barely conscious in severe pain.
Janey, stay with me. Where's Greg?
it hurts so much.
did he rape you?
hang in there, sweetheart. Just hang in there.
she's going into shock.
that son of a bitch really did a number on her.
he drugged her too.
hang in there for me, Janey.
you're gonna be all right, but you gotta hold on, okay?
you hear me?
I'm gonna ride with you. - Sure thing.
what's going on, Greg?
is Janey okay?
what the hell do you care?
Greg Hartley, you're under arrest for the rape and kidnap of Janey Speer.
you have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Elliot. / Come on, Svengali. Lay some of that sweet talk on me.
any news on Janey? - No, nothing yet. She's still in the ER.
your wife is here.
what's up?
Kathleen's locked in her room, refusing to come out.
you wanna tell me why?
I told her I didn't want her to see Kevin anymore and it would've been nice if you'd back me up on that.
well, then you should've talked to me.
we both agreed the guy's no good for her.
no, we agreed to talk to her together. But you went off half-cocked.
well, all right. I did what I had to do.
well, that's refreshing.
okay, what is this? If you got something to say, just say it.
why haven't you signed the divorce papers?
it's been months, Elliot.
you won't talk to me.
you won't talk to my lawyer.
the kids are asking if we're getting back together.
I've run out of things to say.
what do you want? - An answer.
I don't know.
I guess that's an answer.
call your daughter.
I swear to you, I did not rape her!
Yeah, you did.
over and over. You hurt her so badly, you left her screaming in agony.
I didn't do that. I don't know what happened to her.
you raped her, that's what happened.
we had sex. It was consensual.
consensual? What do you mean consensual?
look at it. You just see yourself over here!
you're a 30-year-old man.
she's seventeen! She's not a child!
she sure as hell looks like one. Little girls turn you on, big man?
I didn't break any law. Janey wanted me to have sex with her.
and you said, "fine, baby,
buy yourself some lingerie and practice your sex positions"?
Janey did that all herself. She's curious.
curious about getting drugged too?
I don't know what that is or where she got it.
why don't I believe you, Greg?
why don't I believe one word that's coming out of your pedophile mouth?
ask Janey. She'll tell you the truth.
I would never hurt her.
I love her.
do we know what's in the syringe?
not yet. - Hope it's something illegal.
otherwise, I've got no reason to hold him.
sexual consent law isn't based on how old someone looks, only on how old they are.
we gotta find out if he coerced Janey in any way.
soon as she's out of surgery, we'll talk to her.
Janey sustained serious injury to her reproductive system.
the surgeon had to remove an ovary.
what the hell did he do to her?
isn't it obvious? The bastard nearly raped her to death.
there is no evidence of rape.
then what happened?
was Janey trying to get pregnant? - Why?
the syringe she used had menopur in it. - That's a fertility drug.
taken without a doctor's supervision, it's extremely dangerous.
it can cause ectopic pregnancy, enlarged and hyperstimulated ovaries.
that's what caused the damage.
will she ever be able to get pregnant?
Janey has mosaic Turner's, so it's possible.
but abusing the menopur has made it less likely.
can we talk to her? - She's in there.
do you know where she got the menopur?
not from me.
why don't we go in and ask Janey?
how'd you get the menopur?
I bought it on-line and had it sent to Greg's address.
did he want you to get pregnant?
no, I told him they were hormone injections.
so I'd get breasts.
I really wanted to get pregnant.
sweetheart, you're only 17.
don't you understand? I don't have much time left.
I'll go through menopause in a couple of years.
most women have more than 20 years to have a child.
I'm lucky if I have five.
there's egg donation, adoption.
I don't want somebody else's baby. I want my own.
you nearly killed yourself.
you don't need to be thinking about children.
you need to graduate and go to a good college.
dad, I am not a child. Stop telling me what to do!
you did this. You put these crazy ideas in her head.
this happened under your roof with one of your employees.
Oh, you're just dying for your day in court to say that. / Stop it!
please just stop fighting!
you two should wait outside, please.
okay, baby.
we'll be outside.
so what's the truth about Greg?
I love him.
and he didn't force you? - No.
if anything, I persuaded him.
did you ever think why he's interested in you sexually?
you mean because I look so young?
Yeah.
boys my own age think I'm a freak.
they'll never date me.
Greg and I have so much in common. We love the same movies, the same music.
we can talk for hours.
he loves me for me, not for my body.
still...
he's never settled down with any girlfriends his own age.
he's 30 years old.
what is it, Janey? Tell me.
nothing.
I know people will disapprove, but so what?
he loves me. - He left you in agony in a hotel room.
he ran away.
he went to the drugstore to get me some painkillers. He came back.
that's why you were able to arrest him.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to live my life.
this girl is being pulled apart by an overprotective father and an overly permissive mother.
I think Janey knows what she wants.
I think we should listen to her.
Yeah, and let Greg Hartley have what he wants.
Janey will always look significantly younger than she is.
when she's 30, she's gonna look 17.
is Greg Hartley a pedophile then?
look, I got a problem with any 17-year-old dating a 30-year-old.
well, you may not approve, but legally, a 17-year-old can sleep with whoever she wants to.
you can't tell me Janey's little girl looks don't turn him on.
even if that's true, lots of women shave and starve themselves to look younger.
it's a pervasive male fantasy.
the dirty cheerleader, the naughty schoolgirl.
and that makes this ok?
I once had a patient, Renee.
Renee was born a male, and then underwent surgery to become a female.
she fell in love with a straight man.
and even though he knew that she was genetically a male, he never saw her that way.
to him, Renee was a woman.
people are weird.
so you think Hartley sees Janey for who she really is, huh?
I'm saying I'm not so sure it's our right to judge her sexual choices.
if she and Greg Hartley are really in love, who are we to try and stop them from being together?
if being the operative word. - Bottom line,
Janey and her family are gonna have to sort this mess out on their own.
no, they're not.
patrol just responded to the Speer house.
Yeah, I ripped it up.
Tate called me to pick up my stuff.
and when I got here, Nathan tried to buy me off.
what are you talking about?
that's a check for $20, 000.
that's what he thought his daughter was worth.
that true? - Yes.
we'd pay more to get him out of Janey's life.
I'm not leaving Janey. I love her.
you say that again, I'm gonna kill you!
easy, Mr. Speer. - Get out.
make sure he leaves.
we saw Janey at the hospital this morning.
she said as soon as she's better, she's gonna go live with him.
I don't know what I can do.
file a pins with family court.
it's a person in need of supervision.
convince the court that Janey needs to live at home.
it's only good till she's 18.
but a couple months might be all she needs to get over that creep.
if my lawyer calls you, would you testify? I mean about Greg?
it would help if there was something to testify about.
did you do any background checks on Greg before you hired him?
previous employers, references? - Of course. Why?
something Janey said. Or didn't say.
could I have a copy of that?
detective Stabler, in your opinion, should Janey Speer be allowed to live with Greg Hartley?
no.
because she's too young?
because she doesn't know Greg Hartley.
what do you mean?
four years ago, Mr. Hartley was fired from a job in Nassau county for having an inappropriate relationship with his employer's 15-year-old daughter.
your honor, this is a completely unsubstantiated accusation.
Mr. And Mrs. Bianchi are waiting outside to tell their story if you'd like.
you'll get your chance, Ms. Walsh.
go on, Mr. Van Allen.
were charges filed against Mr. Hartley?
no, according to the Nassau county detectives, the girl refused to testify 'cause she was, quote, "in love with Mr. Hartley.
in your experience as a special victims unit detective, what does this tell you about Mr. Hartley?
he's attracted to little girls.
a suitable companion for Janey Speer?
no. - Thank you.
before we come to Mr. Hartley, what is your opinion of my client, detective?
do you think she's bright? - Yes.
could she function in the outside world, hold down a job, for example?
I guess.
in the Nassau case, no criminal charge were filed against Mr. Hartley.
because the girl wouldn't testify.
because nothing happened.
her parents think something did. - They think.
but as far as the police and the courts are concerned,
Mr. Hartley is innocent of any wrong doing.
well, he got away with it.
you have a 17-year-old daughter, don't you? / Objection!
detective Stabler's personal life isn't relevant.
this witness clearly has a personal bias in this case, your honor.
why else would he go trawling through New York state digging up dirt on Mr. Hartley?
do you have a daughter, detective?
I have three daughters and one son. And they have nothing to do with this.
despite the fact that you're separated from your wife and hardly see your kids?
don't you talk about my family.
despite the fact you once pulled your 17-year-old daughter's boyfriend out of a car and threatened him with violence if he didn't leave her alone?
that has nothing to do with this.
it has everything to do with this, detective.
because it affects your ability to view this case.
when you look at Nathan Speer, you see a man, a father like yourself, who is about to lose his daughter.
that's why you're going after the man that Janey loves. / No!
I'm going after a pedophile.
Janey, do you understand that if you live on your own, you could be cutting all financial ties with your family?
if that's what my dad wants to do, yes.
do you have a plan?
I'll finish high school and go to college.
major in business like my dad.
how will you pay for this?
I'll get a job.
I'm really good with computers. I can work from home.
where would home be?
with my boyfriend Greg Hartley.
is Mr. Hartley happy with this arrangement?
Yes, Greg loves me.
I know everyone thinks it's weird, but part of having Turner's is accepting who I am.
I have accepted it.
I don't think it's fair that my father, or anyone, should break us up because they can't accept that I'm a woman.
Hey!
what's going on? - Butt out. She's my girlfriend.
your girlfriend? Show me some ID.
take a hike, lady. She's not showing you anything.
Hey, I'm talking to you. - Are you nuts?
no, you are. Molesting a child in public?
stop it, please! He's my boyfriend!
stop, leave him alone! - I'm a cop.
and you're under arrest.
there a problem here?
creep was making out with that girl.
get her off of me. - Please tell her.
creep's legal. Girl's 17.
she's 17?
Janey, come here.
you sure you wanna do this?
let's go home.
you just gonna let them walk away?
it's what the court ordered.
what's it to you anyway?
you're detective Stabler, right? - Yeah.
captain said you'd be here.
I'm Dani Beck, your new partner.
welcome to the world of grey.
in the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous.
in New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as The Special Victims Unit.
these are their stories.
when did you know Janey and Connor were missing?
we were just learning about the Q-ball on Apollo spacecraft and how it is held together by the rubber band.
when miss Phillips said it was time to go.
so we lined up to hand back our museum recorders and Connor and Janey were just gone.
they didn't even say good-bye.
that's so rude.
did you see Janey and Connor talking to any grown-ups?
just to miss Phillips. She's our teacher.
are Janey and Connor friends?
well, Connor has a crush on her.
and he always sticks up for her when she gets picked on.
who picks on her?
I do not pick on Janey.
she made fun of me because I said "epi-tomey" instead of epitome.
so I pushed her into her locker.
you push her into anything today?
even if I wanted to, I couldn't have.
she was being escorted by her personal bodyguard.
you mean Connor.
could they have run off together?
Connor's psycho enough.
no one else hangs out with Janey. - Why not?
cause she's a freak.
kids her own age don't want anything to do with her.
aren't Janey and Connor the same age?
no, Connor's 13 and Janey's 17.
she sure doesn't look it.
Janey has a genetic disorder called Turner syndrome.
that's why she looks so young.
why are they in the same class? - They're not.
we're a small prep school for gifted children, so the honors clubs takes seventh graders to seniors.
did you notice anyone suspicious around Janey or Connor?
I, I didn't.
God, help me.
when did you notice they were missing?
not until the curator told me that they hadn't returned their cassette players.
that's why he still had their IDs.
sign-out sheet says Janey has cassette player number 159.
Connor has 160.
people walk off with these things all the time.
so the museum installed a tracking device into each one.
you can even set it to find a specific player.
what range? - 500 yards.
159 is out of range.
160's somewhere nearby.
CSU is on it.
okay, signal's coming from behind the fence.
don't see any security cameras.
only the ones inside watching the collections.
all right, it's in the bushes.
here we go.
number 160. - That's Connor's.
hold up.
Connor Wesley. - There's blood on the laces.
kid must've fought back.
Connor's father just got a ransom call for $300.
for two kids? What is that, some kind of joke?
caller sounded young. He wants the money dropped off at a video arcade.
says he's got a gun.
if the money's not there in an hour, he's gonna use it.
law & Order SVU 8x02. Clock
original AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/09/26
what did you find out?
TARU's in place on the Connor family phone.
the kidnappers haven't contacted Janey's parents yet.
but the father's on a plane to Vancouver.
what time did the flight leave? - 11: 15.
we're checking the flight manifest.
anything yet? - Negative.
money's still there.
I got a possible here. White male, about 5 foot 5.
he's got blue jeans and green fatigues.
warmer.
we got a bite.
police!
where you going, pal?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
is this your lunch?
what's this, bologna?
a guy said he'd pay me 50 bucks to pick up the bag.
all right, delivery boy. Where you taking it?
I promised to keep my mouth shut.
maybe a little jail will help you open it up.
Jake Taylor. 556 West 112th st.
cathedral parkway exit off Riverside is the quickest route. I swear.
police! Get your hands in the air! Where's the gun?
what gun? / The gun you said you were gonna use on Connor over there.
I made it up.
you scamming us, Connor?
Yes, sir.
how'd the blood get on your shoe?
I squeezed a raw steak on it. So you'd think I got hurt.
anyone else here?
Where's Janey?
who's Janey?
I'm gonna let you boys in on a little secret here.
filing a false kidnapping report, that's five years in prison.
stop jerking us around. Where is she?
who called in the ransom?
I did. But it was Connor's idea.
I lost 300 bucks betting on baseball.
this was the only way my dad would give me...
Where's Janey?
she, she stayed at the museum.
no, she didn't. Janey's gone.
when's the last time you saw her? - When I split.
she made sure Miss Phillips wasn't looking, gave me the signal to go.
look, you cooked up this phony kidnap scheme to squeeze your old man for money.
why'd Janey run away? - I don't know.
she have problems at home? - No.
her dad's real cool. Loaded too.
owns all these hotels. Gave her anything she wanted.
what about her mother? - Never met her.
she took off when Janey was little.
listen. Something made Janey run.
they tell me you're her bodyguard. What does she need one of those for?
Janey gets picked on.
by who? - Everyone.
they think she's a geek.
when she ran for student council president, they booed at her so bad, she had to skip school for a week.
so if I'm elected to the student council, I'm gonna make really big changes.
I've got cool ideas.
like what?
like making it okay to go off-campus for lunch.
we already do that.
but it's against the rules, and it shouldn't be.
they should treat us like adults.
and electing a little girl is gonna get them to do that?
principal said they were pretty rough on her.
girls with Turner syndrome are incredibly bright.
but they can have trouble connecting with kids their own age because they don't go through the same stages of puberty.
and they don't look their age.
these girls often don't grow breasts, they rarely get their periods, and they usually don't grow to be taller than a ten year-old.
Janey's a 17-year-old trapped in a child's body.
which could be dangerous for her.
she looks like a little kid, wandering the streets alone.
a pervert's walking fantasy.
the Amber alert is out.
I'll have Munch ride TARU on the museum security camera tapes.
Elliot, you head over to Janey's house.
father home yet?
no, he's on his way. But the grandfather's home.
I'll take Fin.
Hey, Elliot.
FYI, chief of D's called. They're working on a new partner for you.
no, I'm fine with Munch and Fin until Olivia gets back.
well, that may take a while.
what are you doing here? Is everything all right?
I need to talk to you.
a couple days ago, you were never gonna speak to me again.
you really screwed up things between me and Kevin.
good. I don't want you to see him again.
it's not your decision. I love him.
what do you mean you love him? You're 17 years old.
so I can't love anyone?
look, you're too young to be serious with anyone.
mom says you're overreacting.
well, I'll talk to your mother about that later.
now you're gonna be late for school. Wait here. I'm gonna drive you.
Hey, Kathleen?
I hate you!
everything okay?
man, you're lucky you don't have daughters.
Cragen wants us to interview Janey's family.
this way, detectives.
I'm Tate Speer, Janey's grandfather.
have you got anything? - Not yet.
this is all my fault.
I should never have let Janey take that school trip.
you often keep Janey out of school functions?
she's delicate, requires constant supervision.
but you let her go today.
she begged me. And she loves museums.
they're usually safe, aren't they?
now some sick son-of-a-bitch has taken her.
we're gonna need to see her bedroom.
there's quite a few plaques here, awards.
looks like she's a smart kid.
she loves science and math.
she makes better grades than most of the boys in her class.
she have a boyfriend?
she's only a child.
any boys call or come over?
Mr. Speer, is there a reason Janey might've run away?
problems at home maybe?
no. Absolutely not.
my granddaughter is happy.
she was kidnapped.
where were you this morning, sir?
I was here with my staff. Do you want to question them, hmm?
we will. / What about your business? You have any enemies?
anybody who'd like to hurt you or your son financially?
we laid off some people about a month ago renovating one of our hotels.
everyone got a nice severance package.
and Janey's mom?
that drunk. She walked away from Janey when she was five.
we don't talk about her in this house.
wait, what are you doing with that?
a lot of kidnappings start in internet chat rooms.
Janey might've met someone online.
I seriously doubt it. We only allow her ten minutes a day on-line.
still, it's best if we let one of our techs take a look at it.
that was Munch. TARU called. They found something.
this is what we got off the museum security tapes.
if you look at the screen near the rear door, you'll see Connor make his exit.
what about the girl?
patience, my friend. 10: 05 A. M.
Janey's left the main group.
gets approached by a stranger. Watch.
the woman offers her something.
whatever it is, Janey took it.
and goes with her.
that's all. - No, it's not.
what is that, a logo? - Yep.
I enlarged it, cleaned it up.
there.
that's her.
MAIA, I'm detective Stabler.
were you at the Manhattan science museum this morning?
Nathan sent you, didn't he?
Janey's father.
Oh, you know Janey.
I'm her mother.
where is she? - At school.
isn't she?
why are you here? Has something happened to her?
you tell us. - No.
what's happened to her?
just come with us, lady. - What's he done to her?
what's the bastard done to my baby?
he's taken her. He's taken her, hasn't he?
I swear. I don't know where Janey is.
why were you at the museum?
she asked me to meet her.
she said she needed baby pictures for some school project.
the way it looks on the security camera,
Janey wasn't too happy to see you.
Nathan must've taken her.
it's just the type of sneaky, underhanded trick he'd pull.
well, he's halfway to Vancouver right now, and the flight record shows Janey's not with him.
so let's try again, okay?
well, then he must've paid someone to take her.
why would he? She lives with him.
because two months ago, I filed for joint custody.
how long have you been out of your kid's life?
12 years. / 12 years. Now all of a sudden, you want back in just like that?
not just like that.
three years ago, I got sober.
I asked Nathan to give me another chance.
he said that Janey had forgotten me.
so he's a jerk.
it still doesn't make any sense for him to snatch her.
last week, Janey told the judge she wanted to live with me.
the judge makes his decision next week.
you don't think Nathan would do this?
ask him why he took Janey to Vancouver last month to look at schools.
ask him why he made her promise not to tell me.
detectives.
we got a hit off the Amber alert.
a woman thinks she saw a girl matching Janey's description being pushed into a silver Lexus SUV at 87th and central park west.
three blocks from the museum. What time? / 10: 30.
you got a description of the driver?
male and tall.
but check out the family vehicle.
silver Lexus SUV.
who had the car this morning?
Greg Hartley drove it to school with Janey and uh,
he's Nathan's assistant.
he drives Janey most days.
Greg, these detectives wanna ask you a question.
after you dropped Janey off today, what'd you do with the car?
brought it back. I've been working here all day.
you didn't run any errands? - No.
Where's the car right now? - In the garage.
not like we have the only Lexus suv in Manhattan.
we gotta start somewhere.
there. Right where it's been all day.
well, why don't... we make sure of that?
10: 10, camera seven. Silver Lexus still in its spot.
fast forward.
who's that?
a guy getting into the Lexus. Do you know him?
not from behind, no.
fast forward.
pause it right there.
now do you recognize him?
never seen him before, no.
what's he doing in your car? How'd he get the keys?
not from me. The key's been in this box since Greg gave them to me this morning.
let's find out when that car came back here.
car's back, and our mystery man is gone.
12: 25. Plenty of time to take Janey, bring the car back, and cover his tracks.
we're gonna need that tape.
crime scene unit will come down here and go over the Lexus.
it's the lab.
Janey's backpack.
found it in a dumpster two blocks from the museum along with her museum cassette.
changed her clothes. Any prints?
at least twenty sets.
take time to go through them.
but I found something else.
a broken drug capsule in the bottom of the backpack.
had some kind of gel in it.
I asked Dr. Warner to take a look.
I analyzed the gel.
mainly ethanol and water.
the only active ingredient is testosterone.
what's she doing with that?
I traced the lot code and made some calls.
the gel's being used in an experimental study on women with pituitary problems.
not on the market yet. - Who's doing the study?
one Dr. Alexander Shulman.
if it's okay with you, I'd like to tag along.
find out how a 17-year-old girl gets her hands on this stuff.
I'm running a clinical trial on women with short stature.
but I'm also doing a side study on girls with Turner syndrome.
does that include Janey Speer?
she was one of my first volunteers.
how does the gel help girls with Turner's?
same way it does those with pituitary problems.
builds bone and muscle mass and increases libido.
wait a minute. You're trying to increase the sex drive of girls who look like kids?
women with Turner's get their periods late and menopause early.
so they have very little time to have a normal sex life.
I'm just trying to help them.
was Janey sexually active?
I can't divulge personal information.
well, let's see what your funders say when they find out you've been testing your medication on underage girls without parental consent.
Janey Speer's file with a parental consent form.
it's signed by her mother.
Yes, I took Janey to Dr. Shulman. But only because she wanted to go.
Janey's dad know?
no. He'd freak out. - I'll bet he would.
how about the judge in your custody case? Does he know?
you can't tell him.
Janey did that for herself.
she's very strong-willed.
what does that mean? You're the parent. You're in charge.
have you got kids?
that's none of your business.
you have.
wait and see what happens if you get pushed out of their lives.
see how much influence you have then.
let's get one thing straight.
you weren't pushed out of Janey's life. You left.
and I'll never forgive myself.
when I found that Janey had Turner's,
I couldn't cope. I ran away.
but I am sober now. And I am trying to get to know my daughter.
by hot-wiring her libido?
kids experiment, especially bright kids like Janey.
I'm only trying to create a safe environment for her to do so.
Nathan still thinks she's 12 years old.
she looks 12 years old. He's trying to protect her.
typical father.
you'd rather lock your daughter up in a convent than admit that she's a woman.
Janey is not a child.
I am trying to show her the real world.
has she shown any interest in boys lately?
she never has her head out of a book long enough to notice them.
even when she's here, she prefers to surf on my computer.
she uses your laptop?
Nathan has some stupid rule not allowing more than ten minutes a day on-line.
I'm gonna need to take that.
do you think she met someone on the computer?
you're the one who wanted to introduce her to the real world.
do you know this man?
no, I've never seen him before. Did he take Janey?
I don't know.
but I'll keep you posted.
Maia's computer answered a lot of questions.
Janey's home laptop was clean, but she'd been using terminal services.
you mean she was running another computer through her own.
she's a smart kid.
used remote desktop on her computer to operate Maia's.
so every website she visited, every person she talked to on-line was registered to Maia's computer, not her own.
so where was this little brainchild going on-line?
some not very childish places.
RedlightManual. com learn the tricks of love. Make him your sex slave forever.
lingerie.
that sex drive gel was working overtime.
what else you got?
maps of the museum.
and emails between her and Connor Wesley two days before they both disappeared.
Janey to Connor. "You wanna make it look real,
so you have to leave something with blood on it.
otherwise, they'll just think you ran away.
any chat rooms?
none, but the last couple of weeks, she visited a service-offered site.
Forgoodcompany. Com.
was she looking for a gigolo?
no, but she got chatting with a Dan O'Schell.
did she arrange to meet him?
he gave her the number at Old Whiskey's pub where he's a bar back.
that's our guy.
yo, Danny. I gotta talk to you a minute. Come here.
wait in line.
what the hell are you doing?
Where's Janey Speer? - Who?
remember now? - That weird kid?
I picked her up on 87th and dropped her off in Battery park.
where in Battery park? - Corner of west Thames and south end.
she meet anyone? - No. Just walked away.
you used her dad's car. Where'd you get the keys?
she mailed me the key. Told me where the car was.
so you just picked up this girl and dropped her off downtown.
why would you do that? - She paid me. 200 bucks.
I haven't even spent it yet. There's the key.
she didn't tell me what to do with it.
that's a strange story, Dan. Why should we believe you?
she hired me. I wished I never would've met her.
who is this girl?
Janey helped Connor set up his fake kidnapping.
she hired a stranger to drive her across town.
she had her mom bring baby photos to the museum like she was leaving home for good.
she visited websites advertising sex positions and lingerie.
not to mention juicing on testosterone.
what's she up to, doc?
it goes way beyond the normal teenage curiosity about sex.
has she been to any chat rooms or met anyone online?
not that we've seen. But she could've met someone in one of her dad's hotels.
family keeps her on a pretty short leash.
it's hard to see how any stranger could get close enough.
but what kinda guy wants to have sex with a girl who looks 12 apart from a pedophile?
it might look like she planned it.
but I think she's being manipulated by someone who wants to mold her into his ideal sex object.
Yeah, a child he can have sex with legally.
so who's Janey's svengali?
start at home. Which man is she closest to?
dad, grandpa. - She's the only female in the house.
and grandpa's wound a little bit too tight.
he freaked out when we touched Janey's computer.
but if he's already got her, why the elaborate vanishing act?
stabler. - Maybe she was gonna tell the truth.
he panicked. He set up the kidnap.
got enough money have somebody squirrel her away somewhere.
cops picked up Janey's father at Kennedy. They're bringing him straight here.
present him with the evidence. See what he's got to say.
why not throw mom into the mix?
parents in the middle of a custody battle get so furious with each other.
they sometimes say more than they intend.
brought your lawyer, Mr. Speer?
I arranged to meet him here.
to offer moral support. My client is extremely upset.
seven hours stuck on a plane.
all I could do was think how Janey must be suffering.
do you know anything yet?
we have evidence Janey ran away to meet someone.
we found these websites on her laptop.
can you help us with it?
Janey would never visit these sites.
they must've popped up when she was researching something else.
like how to get testosterone?
what? - To increase her sex drive.
she must've introduced Janey to this trash.
do you have any proof of that?
Janey was happy, living in a loving home.
then three years ago, her mother, who deserts her when she was five, waltzes back in and demands to be a parent again.
ever since, Janey's been depressed and agitated.
now I see why.
was it true that Janey told the judge she wanted to live with her mother?
Maia manipulated Janey into saying that.
all I'm saying is if my ex breezed back in looking for custody of my kids after I did all the work,
I wouldn't be waiting around for some bogus decision by a judge, especially if I had money and a place like Canada to run away to.
this is preposterous. Are you accusing my client...
I thought you were only here for moral support.
Mr. Speer, I need you to be honest with yourself.
why is Janey itching to get away from you?
you son of a bitch. - That's it. We're leaving.
Nathan? Where is she?
you tell me.
I'm not the one hiding behind a lawyer.
you took her. God help us if this judge leaves her with you.
at least she won't become a drunken slob.
the only reason I got drunk was because you cared more about your damn hotels than me or your daughter! / You drank 'cause you couldn't face your own child.
you ran away.
well, I'm back. And I'm gonna stop you from smothering her.
how? By giving her drugs to have sex?
Oh, screw you, Nathan. - Has the booze rotted your brain?
no, screw you! - Okay, you all...
I am the only parent in Janey's life, and you are never getting custody of her.
where are you hiding her?
you bastard! - Easy, easy, easy!
interesting that Nathan brought his lawyer with him.
I know Van Allen. He's an immigration specialist.
he often handles custody cases where one parent is a foreigner.
so he would be really helpful if a parent wanted to remove his child to Canada.
and if Nathan moved Janey while she's the subject of an ongoing custody case, he's guilty of custodial interference and parental kidnapping.
and Van Allen knows that.
the way Van Allen's behaving it's like he thinks Nathan did it.
he's probably afraid of being implicated himself.
he should be. I've been checking the Speer family LUDs.
over the last few days, there've been a half a dozen calls to an Annabelle Paz.
who is she? - A travel agent.
I remember the calls because they came in early, usually from Mr. Speer's car on his way to work.
where was he looking to go?
somewhere warm. The Caribbean.
I suggested Hawaii, but he was only interested in islands under French or British jurisdiction.
planning a long trip? - Didn't say.
but he wanted open tickets.
tickets plural? - Yes, for him and his daughter.
they came in a couple days ago looking to purchase.
did he get them?
no, I think he was a little put off by the price.
Why? That family's loaded.
dad said he wanted to pay cash.
now, uh. Is that the little girl?
Yeah, that's her. Sweet little thing. Obviously loved her dad.
is her dad in the photo?
Yeah, that's him.
that's the guy who came in with her?
Yeah, that's Mr. Speer.
no, that's Mr. Speer's assistant.
Where's Greg Hartley? - He left.
he never said anything to me. Is he involved in this in some way?
how often was Greg left alone with Janey?
drives her to school ever day, takes her to her music lessons.
Oh, my god. You're not... - Where'd he go?
he said he was feeling sick. I guess he went home.
clear.
clear.
he's gone. He was right under our noses the entire time.
under the Speers' nose too.
check this out.
boots. Paint, plaster. Some still fresh.
I thought he worked in the office.
this boot has something shiny on it.
crime lab needs to take a closer look.
Yeah, and we'll take a closer look at Greg Hartley.
no hit off Greg's prints.
anything off his financials?
Mr. Hartley doesn't own any property. He spends all his time at work.
credit cards and LUDs offer no clues.
lab got something off his boots.
that shiny stuff was marble dust, a real pricey travertine imported from Italy.
how does that help us? - I called grandpa Speer.
they're renovating one of their hotels downtown.
the foyer's gonna have a nice new marble floor.
hotel closed during renovations? - Yep.
what the hell did he do to her?
we need a bus. 235 Church street.
we got a 17-year-old, barely conscious in severe pain.
Janey, stay with me. Where's Greg?
it hurts so much.
did he rape you?
hang in there, sweetheart. Just hang in there.
she's going into shock.
that son of a bitch really did a number on her.
he drugged her too.
hang in there for me, Janey.
you're gonna be all right, but you gotta hold on, okay?
you hear me?
I'm gonna ride with you. - Sure thing.
what's going on, Greg?
is Janey okay?
what the hell do you care?
Greg Hartley, you're under arrest for the rape and kidnap of Janey Speer.
you have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Elliot. / Come on, Svengali. Lay some of that sweet talk on me.
any news on Janey? - No, nothing yet. She's still in the ER.
your wife is here.
what's up?
Kathleen's locked in her room, refusing to come out.
you wanna tell me why?
I told her I didn't want her to see Kevin anymore and it would've been nice if you'd back me up on that.
well, then you should've talked to me.
we both agreed the guy's no good for her.
no, we agreed to talk to her together. But you went off half-cocked.
well, all right. I did what I had to do.
well, that's refreshing.
okay, what is this? If you got something to say, just say it.
why haven't you signed the divorce papers?
it's been months, Elliot.
you won't talk to me.
you won't talk to my lawyer.
the kids are asking if we're getting back together.
I've run out of things to say.
what do you want? - An answer.
I don't know.
I guess that's an answer.
call your daughter.
I swear to you, I did not rape her!
Yeah, you did.
over and over. You hurt her so badly, you left her screaming in agony.
I didn't do that. I don't know what happened to her.
you raped her, that's what happened.
we had sex. It was consensual.
consensual? What do you mean consensual?
look at it. You just see yourself over here!
you're a 30-year-old man.
she's seventeen! She's not a child!
she sure as hell looks like one. Little girls turn you on, big man?
I didn't break any law. Janey wanted me to have sex with her.
and you said, "fine, baby,
buy yourself some lingerie and practice your sex positions"?
Janey did that all herself. She's curious.
curious about getting drugged too?
I don't know what that is or where she got it.
why don't I believe you, Greg?
why don't I believe one word that's coming out of your pedophile mouth?
ask Janey. She'll tell you the truth.
I would never hurt her.
I love her.
do we know what's in the syringe?
not yet. - Hope it's something illegal.
otherwise, I've got no reason to hold him.
sexual consent law isn't based on how old someone looks, only on how old they are.
we gotta find out if he coerced Janey in any way.
soon as she's out of surgery, we'll talk to her.
Janey sustained serious injury to her reproductive system.
the surgeon had to remove an ovary.
what the hell did he do to her?
isn't it obvious? The bastard nearly raped her to death.
there is no evidence of rape.
then what happened?
was Janey trying to get pregnant? - Why?
the syringe she used had menopur in it. - That's a fertility drug.
taken without a doctor's supervision, it's extremely dangerous.
it can cause ectopic pregnancy, enlarged and hyperstimulated ovaries.
that's what caused the damage.
will she ever be able to get pregnant?
Janey has mosaic Turner's, so it's possible.
but abusing the menopur has made it less likely.
can we talk to her? - She's in there.
do you know where she got the menopur?
not from me.
why don't we go in and ask Janey?
how'd you get the menopur?
I bought it on-line and had it sent to Greg's address.
did he want you to get pregnant?
no, I told him they were hormone injections.
so I'd get breasts.
I really wanted to get pregnant.
sweetheart, you're only 17.
don't you understand? I don't have much time left.
I'll go through menopause in a couple of years.
most women have more than 20 years to have a child.
I'm lucky if I have five.
there's egg donation, adoption.
I don't want somebody else's baby. I want my own.
you nearly killed yourself.
you don't need to be thinking about children.
you need to graduate and go to a good college.
dad, I am not a child. Stop telling me what to do!
you did this. You put these crazy ideas in her head.
this happened under your roof with one of your employees.
Oh, you're just dying for your day in court to say that. / Stop it!
please just stop fighting!
you two should wait outside, please.
okay, baby.
we'll be outside.
so what's the truth about Greg?
I love him.
and he didn't force you? - No.
if anything, I persuaded him.
did you ever think why he's interested in you sexually?
you mean because I look so young?
Yeah.
boys my own age think I'm a freak.
they'll never date me.
Greg and I have so much in common. We love the same movies, the same music.
we can talk for hours.
he loves me for me, not for my body.
still...
he's never settled down with any girlfriends his own age.
he's 30 years old.
what is it, Janey? Tell me.
nothing.
I know people will disapprove, but so what?
he loves me. - He left you in agony in a hotel room.
he ran away.
he went to the drugstore to get me some painkillers. He came back.
that's why you were able to arrest him.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to live my life.
this girl is being pulled apart by an overprotective father and an overly permissive mother.
I think Janey knows what she wants.
I think we should listen to her.
Yeah, and let Greg Hartley have what he wants.
Janey will always look significantly younger than she is.
when she's 30, she's gonna look 17.
is Greg Hartley a pedophile then?
look, I got a problem with any 17-year-old dating a 30-year-old.
well, you may not approve, but legally, a 17-year-old can sleep with whoever she wants to.
you can't tell me Janey's little girl looks don't turn him on.
even if that's true, lots of women shave and starve themselves to look younger.
it's a pervasive male fantasy.
the dirty cheerleader, the naughty schoolgirl.
and that makes this ok?
I once had a patient, Renee.
Renee was born a male, and then underwent surgery to become a female.
she fell in love with a straight man.
and even though he knew that she was genetically a male, he never saw her that way.
to him, Renee was a woman.
people are weird.
so you think Hartley sees Janey for who she really is, huh?
I'm saying I'm not so sure it's our right to judge her sexual choices.
if she and Greg Hartley are really in love, who are we to try and stop them from being together?
if being the operative word. - Bottom line,
Janey and her family are gonna have to sort this mess out on their own.
no, they're not.
patrol just responded to the Speer house.
Yeah, I ripped it up.
Tate called me to pick up my stuff.
and when I got here, Nathan tried to buy me off.
what are you talking about?
that's a check for $20, 000.
that's what he thought his daughter was worth.
that true? - Yes.
we'd pay more to get him out of Janey's life.
I'm not leaving Janey. I love her.
you say that again, I'm gonna kill you!
easy, Mr. Speer. - Get out.
make sure he leaves.
we saw Janey at the hospital this morning.
she said as soon as she's better, she's gonna go live with him.
I don't know what I can do.
file a pins with family court.
it's a person in need of supervision.
convince the court that Janey needs to live at home.
it's only good till she's 18.
but a couple months might be all she needs to get over that creep.
if my lawyer calls you, would you testify? I mean about Greg?
it would help if there was something to testify about.
did you do any background checks on Greg before you hired him?
previous employers, references? - Of course. Why?
something Janey said. Or didn't say.
could I have a copy of that?
detective Stabler, in your opinion, should Janey Speer be allowed to live with Greg Hartley?
no.
because she's too young?
because she doesn't know Greg Hartley.
what do you mean?
four years ago, Mr. Hartley was fired from a job in Nassau county for having an inappropriate relationship with his employer's 15-year-old daughter.
your honor, this is a completely unsubstantiated accusation.
Mr. And Mrs. Bianchi are waiting outside to tell their story if you'd like.
you'll get your chance, Ms. Walsh.
go on, Mr. Van Allen.
were charges filed against Mr. Hartley?
no, according to the Nassau county detectives, the girl refused to testify 'cause she was, quote, "in love with Mr. Hartley.
in your experience as a special victims unit detective, what does this tell you about Mr. Hartley?
he's attracted to little girls.
a suitable companion for Janey Speer?
no. - Thank you.
before we come to Mr. Hartley, what is your opinion of my client, detective?
do you think she's bright? - Yes.
could she function in the outside world, hold down a job, for example?
I guess.
in the Nassau case, no criminal charge were filed against Mr. Hartley.
because the girl wouldn't testify.
because nothing happened.
her parents think something did. - They think.
but as far as the police and the courts are concerned,
Mr. Hartley is innocent of any wrong doing.
well, he got away with it.
you have a 17-year-old daughter, don't you? / Objection!
detective Stabler's personal life isn't relevant.
this witness clearly has a personal bias in this case, your honor.
why else would he go trawling through New York state digging up dirt on Mr. Hartley?
do you have a daughter, detective?
I have three daughters and one son. And they have nothing to do with this.
despite the fact that you're separated from your wife and hardly see your kids?
don't you talk about my family.
despite the fact you once pulled your 17-year-old daughter's boyfriend out of a car and threatened him with violence if he didn't leave her alone?
that has nothing to do with this.
it has everything to do with this, detective.
because it affects your ability to view this case.
when you look at Nathan Speer, you see a man, a father like yourself, who is about to lose his daughter.
that's why you're going after the man that Janey loves. / No!
I'm going after a pedophile.
Janey, do you understand that if you live on your own, you could be cutting all financial ties with your family?
if that's what my dad wants to do, yes.
do you have a plan?
I'll finish high school and go to college.
major in business like my dad.
how will you pay for this?
I'll get a job.
I'm really good with computers. I can work from home.
where would home be?
with my boyfriend Greg Hartley.
is Mr. Hartley happy with this arrangement?
Yes, Greg loves me.
I know everyone thinks it's weird, but part of having Turner's is accepting who I am.
I have accepted it.
I don't think it's fair that my father, or anyone, should break us up because they can't accept that I'm a woman.
Hey!
what's going on? - Butt out. She's my girlfriend.
your girlfriend? Show me some ID.
take a hike, lady. She's not showing you anything.
Hey, I'm talking to you. - Are you nuts?
no, you are. Molesting a child in public?
stop it, please! He's my boyfriend!
stop, leave him alone! - I'm a cop.
and you're under arrest.
there a problem here?
creep was making out with that girl.
get her off of me. - Please tell her.
creep's legal. Girl's 17.
she's 17?
Janey, come here.
you sure you wanna do this?
let's go home.
you just gonna let them walk away?
it's what the court ordered.
what's it to you anyway?
you're detective Stabler, right? - Yeah.
captain said you'd be here.
I'm Dani Beck, your new partner.
welcome to the world of grey.
choice of Arms
wait for me.
what are you doing? Stop, shit.
1... 2... 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock rock.
rock'n roll...
you're feeling better?
Oh, you're so beautiful.
let's see, oh, yes, better.
yes my sweet, yes.
you kept us awake all night. You like this, yeah?
we're taking her out?
straight ahead now.
how do you stop this shit?
turn it off.
stop sulking, we got off alright.
now we take it easy.
stop it, Mickey, enough.
are you free tomorrow?
Yes, why?
Oh, never mind.
Hello, Air Lingus? I'd like to reserve two seats for tomorrow.
for Cork.
Yes, round trip, same day.
we can't stay longer.
we have that dinner here tomorrow night.
Yes, hello, 9: 30 departure and return at 5: 30.
it's perfect.
Mr. and Mrs. Durieux,
I'll pick them up.
Thanks, good bye.
Kilarney January 10th - "Dear sir last year you and your wife saw my stud farm; at the time it was not for sale. Today, I'm forced...
to sell it, if you're still interested, please..." etc, etc.
that house! To the right.
too isolated.
just right for a hideout.
no, we'll be spotted right away. You have something else?
not for now.
get down!
what's this shit? - Shut up and don't move!
just wait now, I'm unarmed.
and Ricky? He knows.
Ricky is your long ... Wait!
I will tell you when ...
wait ...
just a little longer...
what do I do? - Wait ... Now!
Oh, shit!
Why?
Serge... Oh, my God!
we have to go right away.
we'll have more information about the...
we're just off for the day,
we'll be back this evening.
all right.
are you Durieux?
Yes, why? - You must come with me.
what? - Serge is over there.
serge? Where?
come through the back.
well, Roland, you might have knocked.
you're brother had an accident. - Again? What is it this time?
he got killed.
he fucked off again, right?
well, I heard that Serge Oliver was busting out.
a young punk told me.
and you ran straight to my brother to tell him?
well, he kept talking about that guy Serge so...
okay, okay. After all that time...
Bravo, let's hope everyone stays quiet.
the Doctor is coming.
Thanks, Noel. And Nicole?
she's okay, she'll be out for awhile.
I didn't know where to go. Sorry I came here.
his friend squealed on us to Sylvain Constantini.
I am not interested.
I know, but Sylvain is dead.
if his brother knows I'm here, then it will all start over.
you know what his brother is doing? Real estate.
listen, Serge. I'm going to take care of you.
stay here as long as you want. Want to go aboard with your friend?
I can help you, but the all the rest doesn't concern me.
I'll get you some blankets.
he's scared shitless, no?
shut up.
you don't know who Noel was!
it takes me back 20 years.
two months from retirement.
Hi, Raymond. You must know.
no, know what?
I'll call you in 3 hours.
that was the doctor, what's going on?
serge is here.
shit.
Where's the other one?
are you out of your mind?
I'm doing nothing wrong. Swell horses!
you must not be seen. Come back inside and stay there!
no, I'm fed up, fed up.
I'll take care of your car. Come, I'll take you back.
by force? I'd like to see that.
okay, you choose, you stay inside or you leave and shut your trap and never come back here.
you think you scare me?
if it's that way, I'll go to Paris for a spell.
how could you trust that guy? - Serge is dying.
Hello, yes, Serge just passed away.
no, bullshit, don't hang up.
I'm Mickey, let me talk to Noel. But I just spoke to him.
he must help me leave, he promised me this morning.
no, no, you can see me, but I'm coming to see him.
Yes, I'm coming to see him, what's the matter with you?
why are you all so scared? If he doesn't help me. you're in deep shit.
you have to go. - I'm coming with you,
you shouldn't. - You need me, I must come.
you're ok? - Yeah.
he's here already. You see we had to hurry.
gentlemen, I heard the radio
I know why you're here, and I have nothing to say.
you wanted to see me?
well, you've seen me. Now please leave. Goodbye gentlemen.
impressive that Durieux?
we are too polite with these people.
wait.
don't move!
let me go!
I'll start here.
there's brains up there.
he betrayed me, the bastard, tipped the pigs off.
the jerk, bastard, the son of a bitch.
what possessed you?
I arrested three, like him, once.
Durieux, we are going to search your house now.
Henriette, please show these people in.
thank you. Come.
we'll find nothing. Why say that!
hello Lilianne, where is Fernand?
he's not inside, come back tomorrow.
at least you could take off your shoes.
it's better when the mare keeps us awake.
I shall meet you at Orly.
I must go see Constantini.
I can't help it, sorry.
you're hurting my feelings. Me, involved with such scum?
I know nothing about my brother that asshole.
he got mixed up with these punks and their shady deals.
do you think a man in my position can get involved with this scum? Or with a jerk like Mickey?
I hope that Serge is not dragging you into this again.
I dropped my brother, you and I, we're different.
Yeah, even if at one time we were rivals.
no, Noel, I don't know who tipped off my brother.
I can't help you find, Mickey.
sorry.
know what?
you make me sick.
Mickey...Mickey! Shit.
what are you doing here?
just resting.
knocked out again, last night?
and you're quite healthy. Go, leave.
wait, wait, calm down.
wait? Do you know where Ricky might be?
I said you should leave. Are you listening?
what happens to all the guys when they leave? What then?
go to hell, Mickey! Do you realize what's going on?
let me see. - Well?
leave. Now. Shit, please, leave.
are you are afraid, I'll talk.
and what, you turn you in?
don't be ashamed, I'll stay with other people.
everyone makes me sick.
knock-out in the first round!
what are you doing here?
who are you? What do you want?
it's for her.
look where you're going!
fuck all gang members!
sorry, I didn't see, you I didn't mean it.
here's our youngest, look what we have here.
she's my litte peewee, look who is here.
notice him? Look.
great, she's started to cry.
we'll set a place up for you with the kids.
for the groceries.
I haven't seen them for ages. Last time was at your match.
you were a star, remember?
stop or I'll break you. - Ok, I'm broken.
did you get your set? - No, not yet.
you want a set?
what?
you mean a real one?
with gold sticks if you want.
come on.
come.
careful or I'll shoot you.
you shouldn't have ratted to the cops!
so I want money for my troubles, it's normal.
get out of here!
I think it just fair...no?
let me go...
let me go!
get out of here!
Jacques, you okay? - Call a doctor, quick!
I'm sorry Jacques, really.
no harm done, it's nothing.
I'll be back you pricks!
I'll be back and I'll kill you all!
watch your asses!
no gun permit, of course.
I wanted to catch the driver who was speeding,
is that right?
good evening, Mr. Durieux.
you must be in contact with Serge Olivier.
anyway, no gun permit, a runaway car in a crowd.
it's enough to throw you in jail.
you're going to set me free immediately.
what?
I said you will let me go.
in '52 your stupidity caused a double murder on Rue Pasteur.
stop it, Durieux! Please!
in '55... Stop it!
you all know very well that I'm blameless.
I know, Bonnardot, but not everyone will buy it.
I don't know what's going on between you, Serge Olivier and Mickey. You going back to your old ways?
that's OK, I'll get you, the three of you!
Nicole, you must go to a hotel for a few days.
no, no way. - Please, Nicole.
you can't stay here, he's coming back.
and you?
what do you want me to do? I can't sit here and do nothing.
I can't wait for this nutter day and night. I don't have a choice.
we have to leave Durieux free. He'll look for his old contacts eventually.
so we'll sit and wait.
Yeah, once again the informers will do our jobs.
well?
Bonnardot, it's been 30 years of success.
you choose, you're free.
well, I'm leaving.
wait, I'll see you out.
Nicole, don't be that way - What way?
you want me to go, I obey, that's all.
well, Grangier, we won't be away that long, goodbye.
goodbye, Mr. Durieux.
sorry, but it's the first time we're apart, so, it hurts my darling, I love you so much.
Mr. Durieux, sorry.
I just saw the mare and she is restless.
let me go and see what's wrong.
go, I'll take care of her.
Noel, you must go.
go quickly and come back quickly.
I think she's okay, just cranky.
well, don't leave her alone.
you can count on me.
hurry up, fatso. - Go fuck yourself.
here.
thank you.
look at you, moneyman.
Oh, shit.
come on fatso, lets go in. - Go fuck yourself.
come on, meathead, you go first.
hands off, you asshole.
you don't scare me, you jerk! Jerk.
I see your gun... think that scares me?
do something, you shithead. Don't just stand there.
grab your rifle and come here quick.
now you run you cowards. Fucking bitches!
come on.
no, Raoul, no, don't give in.
stop it, stop it!
they're asshole, jerks! - Shut her up or I'll shoot.
I told you, quiet.
she's not listening!
quiet or you're going to get it cunt!
alright, go!
go ahead, leave.
it's sufficient, but it might not be in the house before midnight.
you can go to bed.
she's all we have. We let Durieux slip.
you go to bed.
there it is.
okay, stop it now.
already here? Too bad...
Bye, honey, see you soon. - You're coming?
no we can't, goodnight. - Goodnight.
"Constantini = Bitch, see you soon, Mickey"
no. 2 ... the third to the left ...
here he is, on the avenue. No. 3, you will replace me .
take the parallel to the right.
stop ... We have arrived.
I know him, Roland Davout.
drugs for school kids.
illegal aliens, the works.
don't worry, I'll find him.
get out!
listen to me, find Mickey for me.
you high or what?
understand what I say, punk? You have to find Mickey.
stop it.
Hey, you... - What!
you shut up.
you're ok?
stop!
stop!
Hi, Davout...
stop.
leave me alone!
come with me, friend.
what are you stupid? Let him stay!
let him stay, I said.
don't move.
go back inside.
this is not important. Go!
when Mickey escaped, you ratted on him?
for that?
now you don't know where he is.
they'll hit you until you find out.
and you?
me too, I want to find Mickey.
they have food. The cupboards are filled with preserves.
the car in the garage is full of gas.
no one knows this house, not even my wife.
andrew can you stay with him? - No problem.
goodbye, Noel -Thanks, Andre.
you sure you won't need me?
no thanks.
well...
you'll need this.
call me.
would you like something to drink?
I need a hit.
or I won't talk.
thanks a lot.
what is your name?
Mickey is your friend?
he's my best friend.
then tommorrow, you'll tell me everything.
I don't know where Mickey is.
alright.
was he in your gang before?
a gang is always there when you need help.
you always go back to it, whether you like it or not.
the first time, it was here.
3 or 4 of us jumped him.
one day they had a falling out with Bebert, there.
Bebert wanted to become a chief.
his thing was stealing weapons.
and Mickey?
Oh, he didn't care. He was already boxing.
he even trained at night and he would punch hard.
six victories in a row, in one day.
then one night, he had his first K. O.
in the fifth round.
I go to the locker room.
he seemed okay. He was getting dressed.
he says he has to make a call. I've never seen him again.
that's his photo.
after he stopped fighting, the gang was never the same.
some were working, some were ...still in the joint.
it's hard when a gang disbands.
do these move? - Yes.
well? - Yes, quite.
enough?
on the 17th floor. But Jose lives with his folks.
I don't think Mickey would show up there.
are you going to mess with them?
Oh, please stop sulking.
it's nice, you like it?
are you her father?
you son of a bitch
son of a bitch.
here's where we played soccer.
here turn right...
why the hell are you still here?
will you get out of here, or you'll see.
get out of here.
you little creep.
those bastards! Look what they built here.
a parking lot.
fuck!
Mickey was the goalie.
was he good?
played with all his soul. Such passion.
provided you don't hit the corners. Worthless.
whistled all the time.
I still don't know why he did that.
sounds strange, but that's Mickey.
I think I'm beginning to understand him.
even all his hopes and dreams? Can't know those.
what makes you so sure?
beginning to understand you as well.
is Raoul here?
did he take the car?
when you steal a car, you have to change the license plate!
Dany was living here, but I don't know which door.
what's his last name?
I forget.
would you know it if you saw it written?
here he is.
I don't see it here.
...but I'm not sure.
let's keep going.
here he comes.
Hello, Grangier?
Yes, how are you? Any calls?
and the mare?
she's very restless? Since when?
okay, I'll be there soon.
Hello, Inspector Bonnardot,
Nicole Durieux speaking.
I want you to stop having me followed.
well, you two figure it out.
listen ... talk to him.
it's for you, come.
come.
it's for you.
Hello, Inspector Savin speaking.
well I was asked to do it.
Yes, it was him. Well, I thought...
okay, I'll stop. Okay.
I'm putting him with Davout, they belong together.
no, don't.
as you wish.
well, you can't be seen here.
so stay in the car, while we look for Dany.
if he's there, we'll bring Mickey back to you.
I'm getting out of this.
I don't want to go through with this.
you want us to handle this? - No, it's not worth it.
you're wrong, you'll see when he causes larger problems.
let's at least scare him. -No, let's not.
it will only excite him more.
well, you're the boss.
in this case you must do things differently.
I know Durieux already asked for help. And to whom.
Nicole Durieux was seen on the way to the farm. I'm going, it's my job.
so go, stay up all night. I don't care.
you seem to enjoy it.
where is he?
tell me where he is!
I don't know.
no, stand up.
please wait, not right now, I can't.
he's a bastard, and I'm going to kill him. Kill him.
stop it. You're nuts, he didn't do anything to you.
Oh yea? Prowling around my kid?
what do you want with us? - How did he find her?
what? - No one knows about her.
I don't know. Explain, instead of screaming.
I'm going to turn off the heat.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Nicole Durieux, please.
when was that?
Thanks.
hello.
Yes, Noel, wait.
Hello, Nicole?
it's me. I have your wife and I mean business.
you hear me?
I understand.
wait she's there? With you?
all I have to do is shoot.
no, wait, Mickey. Wait.
look at her. What is she wearing?
she is beautiful, isn't she?
I'm madly in love with her.
what's this he is saying?
without her, I'm lost.
if you hurt her, I'm gone. Mickey.
totally gone...
for the past two days, I've wanted to get you.
I've seen lots of places.
even where you used to play soccer.
now, I feel I know you.
you know why I called my wife?
to tell her I was quitting, to tell her she was right.
there are other ways than shooting at each other.
listen, I'm far away, but I am coming as soon as possible.
so you decide.
will you wait for me?
I'll be right there.
what did he say? - Nothing, nonsense.
that's Noel at 12 in Marseille.
Noel, keep the keys.
no, it's not necessary. - Go.
no, I've never seen her before.
all of a sudden I had to have her. But jail is not that bad.
and the baby's mother?
she commited suicide 3 months ago.
I'm not to blame, I barely knew her.
I fucked her one night and only that one night.
then she told me I knocked her up. But I had other things to do at the time.
I never saw her again.
she never told anyone that I was the father.
that why...how did Noel find her?
how old is she?
I saw the car. The mare is not well.
I'll take care of it. Go on home.
you won't need me?
no, thanks. I know her well.
also there was a call for you from Ireland. You must call.
thank you. Good night.
that mare kept us awake many a night.
if she's sick, let's go and see her.
Easy...easy.
what's the matter?
this time she'll need a vet.
let's call him.
he lives 10 minutes from here.
so what?
you must hide...
okay then, all right.
police! Don't move!
I thought it was you.
it's your fault.
it's all your fault.
who are you? What's going on?
I'm sorry, let me say...
I said freeze, he started shooting. She came out, I'm sorry.
you're letting him go?
I have no charges against him. - But, he's a witness!
witness to what? His wife's death.
it's you...
you and your methods.
we all could have been working together safely.
don't worry, I'll take the blame and early retirement.
so it's your turn to play.
no no, hush, hush.
we're going for a drive, you'll see
at night it's beautiful and everyone is asleep.
and we're up, and we can go as fast as we like.
you'll see.
you're going to catch cold.
you're right. It's nice. Come ...
what is this?
wait, I have to put her to bed.
we need money as soon as possible, this is Durieux we're talking about.
what? Now? Yes.
come on, you piece of shit!
what about dogs? We do not even have sugar.
we would need sugar, some sugar.
I have a better idea.
take the wheel and leave the engine running. Understand?
get in!
"will the military? After failure its government..."
... just watch the neighbourhood tour and public buildings.
only the good will of the citizens ...
... will emerge from this crisis.
if they had waited a week ...
... to clean the streets ...
... armed elements ...
Mickey just tried to rob a bank.
in neighbourhoods riddled, bombed houses ...
... in the deserted streets, crowded Glass and rubble ...
... will require weeks to return to live there.
according to witnesses, Durieux picked him up.
Durieux. Why?
in accepting the cease-fire might be able to know ...
... who was responsible of the massacre ...
... since after 2 months of fighting there were nearly 800 dead.
... this time will not be easy to forget that ...
Durieux, why?
maybe because he's already done this from '42 to '44.
during the war and then on his own afterwards.
tell me what your informers told you. Who asked for help Durieux?
get the hell out of here!
help me, you bastard! Help me to find him! Help me!
help me ...
Hey! Hey! Wait!
the lesson is not finished yet.
what Durieux did, others did too. But they never stopped.
sure, that means nothing to you, but to me, yes.
Durieux went to see them ...
... as I knew he would.
thanks to my methods.
I even know something else: Jean Mucchielli has a house near Paris that no one knows.
hurts like hell.
what the hell are you doing with me here?
if I only knew.
what did you do to my wound? Did you wash your hands first?
go ahead, keep talking nonsense.
you're right ...
I'm fed up...sick!
how did you know I had a daughter?
I didn't know.
I knew where you hid out, nothing more.
I saw you with Ricky. In front of her house.
I don't know what you're talking about.
my God!
that's why I went back to your house, otherwise I would have never gone there.
why didn't you tell me on the phone?
I do not know, I was afraid for her.
then you talked to me. You told me to wait so I did.
I only wanted to wait, do you understand?
then there was the police who started shooting.
okay, go ahead ... more ...
now tell me it's not your fault. Tell me.
and this? Is this not your fault?
and you? You're innocent, perhaps?
there is a car in the garage. Get out of here.
Oh, yeah, that's it, leave. I'm better off alone.
I'm better off alone. Go on, get out of here!
Oh, shit.
get out, Duroix! They're here!
stop, it for heaven's sake! Stop!
don't shoot anymore! Stop! That's an order!
aim well, this well be your last bullet.
get up! Up! Up!
I'm taking him. Let me go.
you drive.
shut the door.
go!
call the station.
have you killed anyone before my wife?
no...
stop.
get out.
get out.
walk.
these five shots will always ring in your head.
who is it? -Mucchielli. -Mucchielli.
hello. Are you ready? - Yes.
we must be in Le Havre at 8 o'clock. We have plenty of time.
what is your name?
sometimes you go around the city, or walk on the road
you'll see someone in the corner.
he just stands there, but as if he's like to do something.
at the bus stop, there are always some normal persons waiting.
what is this man thinking about?
what is he looking for?
maybe he's looking for the past.
at 6 o'clock on Sept. 20th, 1998
I noticed another guy.
but this time is not the same
because this guy is me
a dumb, unresponsible, craven wanderer.
at that moment, I thought my growing-up days.
in the 80's, my second girlfriend was doing cleaning.
she asked me,
do you love me?
I said, Yes.
but actually I didn't know
several years later, my future girlfriend asked me,
where were you in 1989?
I was in Berlin at that time, on the wall of Brandenburger Tor
actually
that was me watching videotape with a woman in the bed.
sometimes my life is not bad.
Sometimes...it's unlucky really unlucky
sometimes I look into the mirror thinking about the life of the passed several years
I'm in my early 30's now, life is going on.
I want you to make a decision.
don't worry.
of course
I love my girlfriend
I wasn't thinking about other stuff, just didn't want her to leave
I even want a baby
why did I hesitate?
I don't know.
but I suddenly want to do one thing
I've to go out for some days. Go where?
Berlin. I'm going to Berlin.
Berlin? You are a dumb, unresponsible, craven wanderer.
I think so. Really
learning to Lie
OK. I haven't told anybody yet.
the whole story began in 1982.
I was 18 years old, watching my father dancing alone.
here it is.
I'll put it down here
Helmut. Hi, Uncle Bertram
sit down.
I want to talk to you. Talk to me? What about?
you are going to move out from this house.
go out to the society, live independently.
some young men can not handle it.
do you have some democracy activities at school?
no. Oh, you don't believe it.
and, are you dating any girl?
it's very simple.
not yet, but I'm trying.
dear Students,
we are here discussing on public responsibility...
Thanks.
it's worthy for me to come here this time.
...we will have two sides here...
everybody is here. Let's begin.
please.
dear Students,
today, human culture is being damaged.
we'll know after studying on it.
atomic weapon is overrunning.
very little impolicy can bring wrack and ruin.
we return to the past.
we can have clean air.
though we will lose a lot of energy.
but the mistake at the beginning can't be settled till now.
it'll go on until the future is lost in the end.
that's the so-called future.
my standpoint is that, everyone's responsibility every problem correlative with it, can not be solved by oneself.
you know, make some changes they should be made by yourselves.
what is it?
my collection.
it's the first, there are ten tracks in all
what's playing?
it's La Paz. So beautiful.
he scared all the girls away just when he came.
when will it be played?
not now.
let's talk about it after arriving. Where do you get these things from? Without names.
this is the music that Schafer used
I think it's ok, especially when the birthday of the old man.
maybe we can play it when arriving in Berlin. Berlin Fisher special performance.
that's right. It really can not be.
hello.
we meet again.
where? Very soon.
I saw it outside the window just now.
no. Just say hello to you.
thanks
so does my friend today.
hi
hi
have you seen me somewhere before? No.
wish you a happy day. Seems there won't be any to us.

no. Maybe we can find them again.
not at all.
we are in Berlin now. Let's listen to the music.
hi
please put your hair back.
goodbye
hi
it looks strange here. Is it?
Yes.
everybody listen.

it's not bad here. Outside.
what will you do after leaving school?
me? Depends on how's the things going.

that's all.
it's a nice journey.
Yes. Right.
I don't wanna go back.
there's the final exams after going back.
what's your plan?
studying medicine. My mother always wants me to.
I don't have other choice.
I wish to be independence

can I have a drink?
I still can't drink beers.
I hardly have entertainment. Really.
sorry, I've to go.
how is it?
it's a happy afternoon.
same here.
I'm thinking about the next time.
couple days later, Helmut Kohl became the prime minister of Germany.
he promised more jobs, facilitating economy and setting up the Department of Atomic Energy
his parentage... can not be accepted by the family.
though his father is very rich...
you have worked in handicraft industry, haven't you?
before.
can you help me? It needs to be done in 2 weeks.
come to see me. Help me take a look at it.

Yes. I'll write it down for you.
Hi. Are you Helmut?
I'm Helmut. I'm Jutta , Britta's mother

the problem I met is, there's nothing useful only a little is useful.
I always confuse there.
the democracy movements in America
can you give it to me?
it looks like propagandize for fascism
you don't like listening to me.
Yes, I'm listening to you.
it's the setback of democracy.

I think it's not the time.
let's talk about it later.
you are so sweet and handsome.
do you love me?
good morning.
what's your option?

how can it happened?
the thing between you and father?

it can't be saved here.
I can live back in my hometown. We used to live there.

let's keep it going like this. OK.
I think it's good.
it's only between us.
I'm happy when we are together.

do you agree?
OK.
same next week.
we may meet some times in the noon.
me and Britta
we met sometimes but didn't say hello to each other.
it feels strange.
she's strange.
Britta and me waited like this until winter.

I'll stay at home.
damn Christmas.
nothing special.
the atmosphere of festival is not bad.
can you come to be with your girl?
will you come?
I've to explain it to my parents first.
but no problem.
merry Christmas.
merry Christmas.
everybody is fine.
I'm going out later.

Christmas Eve?
but you should stay at home.
can I go out?
good, actually you don't need to ask.
is anyone there?
you are so wasteful.
look inside the ring.
to Britta Hull
do you like it?
of course.
but it's not right.
it must be expensive.
the money is not important.
you are so nice.
I'm going to America
I will go with you.
no, I'm not on vacation.
I'm going to my dad's home in San Francisco.
not for the travel.
but you still have to finish that.
but I will go to school there.
and complete my study in several years.
I may go to visit you sometimes.
good idea.
isn't that great?
helmut, Several years are a very long time.
you may probably meet someone else.
it can't be.
I maybe meet another one.
did you know someone else?
I just want to tell you that several years are very long.
I don't want to leave either.
I cannot sleep without you.
I'll write to you.
I love you, Britta.
bye bye.
dear Britta.
we haven't been in touch for a long time...
I might have changed.
the time during which I write five letters a week to you has passed.
four years later.
west Germany is changing, I'm studying German Society and Politics in university.
I've made some friends here.
of course I will think of the time to USA.
you stay by your dad and perhaps won't come back to Germany forever.
but I always miss your hands and eyes.
I will never forget the Christmas when you and I sleeped together.
Yes.
it seems that there's nothing changed on you.
I'm willing to meeting you again.
your Helmut P. S.
I met Gisela yesterday.
she didn't go to Berlin and stayed here.
for medicine.
medicine is very good and necessary.
have you contacted with the others?
Hale came to me once.
I've lots of things to do and talk with you later.
it's a long story.
I haven't receive your news for a long time.
including other friends.
how is Schafer?
you don't know that completely.
no, I can only find Mucke.
your smile is nice.
I feel a little faint.
I must have drunk too much.
it's still nice.
I just have a little.
you also have beer in Berlin.
that's just a little from your bottle.
how is Schafer?
he's dead.

I thought you might have known that.
I knew nothing.

I like her freedom.
we have a happy life and Britta always has her idea.
not the same with her, Britta
there's no tough atmosphere.
on the other hand we let everything be.
I'm very happy to be with you for the Christmas.

and come here at night.
5: 20 I take you to my aunt.
you don't want to see her.

my grandpa will be kind.
6: 20pm we will stay together.
before that we must prepare for the night.
I invite some Americans.
you know them too, and may be this.
what's the real safety?
gift, music.

the piano will be boring.
God, you have a slut girlfriend.
Gisela's friend.
I must go.

no, it's Barbara's.
her roommate.
she went out on Christmas.

...and in a strange woman's room.
Barbara is not the stranger.
and we are here.
we are the guests.
Gisela's guest.

the beautiful students can be seen here before.
they passed by outside.

several years ago...
...thinking of going to Berlin. And now I'm abroad.
very good girl.
do you see over there?
it will be there every Christmas, that table.
the girlfriend went away 15 years ago.
she didn't come back.
he lost much.
he cannot expect that what that girl will be like.
and ask God.
last time 15 years ago these two people meet on Christmas.
it's the god.
if he knew how to quit...
...everything would be fine.
the girl is great.
but she won't come back when she left.
you think it clear.
how about now?
for friendship.
I'm waiting for you to come.
damn.
what are you doing with that underdress?
what underdress?
you put the underdress of Barbara on your body.
what are you talking about?
sorry, I want to have my teeth brushed.
Thanks.
good morning, Barbara.
you are back.
this Christmas is hard.
drinking, gift, children and other people are wasting time.
I go downstairs.
do you have something to wash?
Yes.
what are you thinking of?
I've got drunk.
do you want to see a movie?
are you OK?
not bad.
she treats me well.
but we didn't change our mind.
sometime it is said as mom...
...girls will forget all the past.
but Gisela won't.
I decide to go to find Barbara.
what a luck! Barbara.
go to have some coffee?
nice to meet you.
you heard from that...
I imagine...
that's really weird.
that's really weird.
why will it be like this?
what do you want to know?
damn.
lies and cheat.
do you have any interest?
are you talking with me?
whose is it? It's mine, thanks.
I want to sleep with you.
and now!
no, you must wait until the next week when Gisela is not in.
I have time in the afternoon.
OK.
please check out.
here.
what's the matter?
Yes, what's the matter?
you said you had the time.
now.
OK.
when Gisela is outside...
I don't know whether this is stimulation or not.
let him be.
this is the key.
I'm changing the character in making love.
change the body position.
I feel good.
there's full of energy.
this is the news in West Germany.
good evening ladies and Gentlemen.
prime Minister Helmut Kohl is talking about the election.
the hard fours years...
anyone here?
helmut, are you here?
you have seen Helmut?
when did you begin?
you must have drunk.
this is very normal.
this is what you want to say.
I don't know what else to say.
maybe you want to say something to explain...
maybe you say that I don't know you will come back.
since it has happened...
do you love her? No.
how about me?
I don't know.
except this is there anything else?
you cannot stay here any more.
I find a room for myself.
sitting before the TV all day...
the intercourse between Germany has become more and more.
some people come to the Hanoverian Street.
the Germany of Democracy shows the belief and hope for the future.
do you have some change?
sorry.
I don't have.
let it be.
you make me save 5 mark.
how about some coffee?
just so simply...
...I've done nothing and go out with this incredible woman.
what are you doing for? I'm the sports reporter.
Really? Let's go to your house, my name is Gloria.
we can do everything.
when we smoke together, we will think of Britta.
Hello, Helmut.
guess! what?
where are we going?
the damn place.
the contradiction in the selfish family.
what's the matter?
it's my uncle.
am I going to say anything?
of course not.
what a pity.
introduce your girlfriend.
what job?
I'm the sports reporter.
Oh?
please have some.
what are you doing?
as usual.
but this is the noon.
come here.
tell me what happened.
what? what happened?
how can you stick with this woman?
I just want her.
you should not treat your parents like this.
you should not treat my girlfriend like this.
Kid...sometime...you cannot make me decide.
you've changed, kid.
I cannot recognize you at all now.
wait for being interview here?
what's history?
the description of the past.
what's history? It's different with what you saw in the book.
do you have some answers?
history is a subject.
your definition is pretty good.
your turn.
history is the record not the process.
the process of knowledge.
are you nervous?
do you have anything to say?
none.
why none?
I cannot understand the story in the book.
it seems that they are all the discussion of theory.
very confused.
good. It has been decided.
other people are dismissed.
damn.
it slowly turns to late 80s.
no changes could be detected.
I can't feel anything that is meaningful.
do you have any interest today?
what interest?
you said nothing there for a long time.
I'm tired I've keeping busy for a whole week in the university.
is it?
Yes. So what?
there's no response.
then my friend Mucke said to me from Berlin
that you are going here.
what? Then he said
that I saw Britta
I saw it in the party, last night.
did you hear the bad news?
what?
you looked pale.
right. The Berlin Wall is going to collapse.
I saw it, too.
after that the boundary is open to all the people.
do you want something to eat? OK
old pal.
I nearly can't recognize you. Come in.
now you are different.
do I look casual?
your parents divorced as well.
have a nice meal. Thanks.
anything do you want? Two pieces, thanks
what condiments do you like? All of these, and pepper
I don't like pepper.
both with pepper. We are going to celebrate the festival, thanks.
OK. Wait a minute.
when did you come Berlin.
a few years ago, and you?
I'm going back.
and then?
I haven't thought of it.
I don't know.
come back. We have work to achieve. What?
we could talk about those things before.
keeping unchanged like before.
sure.
I'm thinking why I can understand before, but now I can't.
you are facing problem.
I keep thinking these days.
thank you.
how about now?
what are you doing?
I'm in a car repair workshop. Just those normal repairing and washing work.
but it feels good.
you said you saw Britta?
Yes. She looks different, like another person.
she's so beautiful.
do you have her number?
no. We just talk for a little while.
but I know where to find her.
anybody else?
I don't recognize.
OK, I didn't go there.
Hello, Helmut.
Hello, Britta.
do you come alone?
I'm with Mucke.
is Mucke here too? Yes.
I don't know this place.
can we go outside?
OK.
are they your friends?
not very familiar.
where have you been after that year?
I went to sleep.
I found a job in the university.
assistance of Prof. Mucke.
how about you? Where are you these years?
I'm in Berlin.
do you have job?
are you working now?
I'm not sure.
just like this.
I'm thinking of going back and finding Mucke.
come aboard.
let me do this.
is this your room?
anything wrong?
nothing. I just want to know.
are you finding place to live?
Yes.
nobody could see the things inside.
Cheers! Welcome to Berlin.
why wines can remain the same
but people cannot?
I can find none of those friends.
can you?
I'm tired.
can we talk tomorrow?
OK.
do you still have that ring?
what ring?
that one I gave you at a Christmas.
Yes.
why did you give up?
how about yesterday?
no. But I may go today.
why didn't Helmut come to find her?
I guess not.
we'd better not to mess our life.
walk at the street just like before.
I don't know where to go.
what do you want to say?
now it's all different.
I used to see Britta, with various of people.
what are you doing?
behaviors before are not very well.
how about now?
I'm not sure.
damn it! You don't know it?
I've never heard of it.
I've thought thousands of time that I should forget Britta.
and 9 years passed like this.
and no Britta in my life.
after 4 or 5 years I got experiences.
I desired of sex.
for many times I began to think that
invite somebody here without making any promise.
I became interested in girl's personal life,
and I just sit and listen to them.
and then I may meet her occasionally at the street,
but the time didn't come
before I got old enough.
I began to notice those persons with more sense of security,
those persons who will not make decision by first sight.
and I found her.
where were you at 1989?
I was in Berlin that time.
on the wall of Brandenburger Tor.
you are really a tough guy.
with Tina I began to think that I will be with her forever.
we lived together in the second year
until we started to discuss will we have a baby.
what happened you went back this time? Nothing, just meet each other.
many people have their own children.
that jerk.
I'm thinking as well
that if we should do it too.
let my mother talk to me.
but you also think so, right?
everybody thinks so.
you may say so.
I can be with you.
what can I say, everyone hopes to have a child.
I have never heard you talk about children.
I don't know when I think of it, and I don't know when he will come.
it is the responsibility of the two.
we already are.
your arrival makes us surprised.
your mother knows other people.
your father is not important any more.
your father will stay here, your mother will move away.
will this kind of thing be funny?
when?
tomorrow.
I've never thought my parents will become strangers.
and become a person who live on his own thinking.
but this happened suddenly.
I am scary.
all things have become scary.
hello.
I almost hit somebody.
I was driving at the streets.
I looked backwards and suddenly there's a man in front of me.
I almost heard the shouting
I was at least calm.
take off the jacket.
I walked out and just saw
there is not much blood on the road.
I didn't know what to say.
I don't want to see no child in the future.
what matter with you.
my parents get divorced.
what? It is !
you must make a decision gradually.
I really don't want to give up this baby.
I am not afraid.
you are.
I love my girlfriend.
I don't like anything else, and just hope she leaves.
I even want to have a baby.
why you are so hesitated?
I don't know.
but there is one thing happens to my mind.
it is still in my heart.
now.
how are you?
how are you, Britta
haven't seen you for a long time.
can we meet outside?
may be tomorrow.
any places before 9 o'clock.
sorry, it is closed.
you can come in.
what kind of drink do you want?
OK, I want 8 cups of beer.
have you ever been here?
maybe.
8 cups of beer.
yours. Thanks.
this is the message. Britta
thank you.
can you take a photo of us?
you haven't changed a lot.
I have booked a seat there.
I am sorry to be late.
but I forgot the place here.
sometimes I forget how to go home.
it's silly. But sometimes you can go everywhere a whole day. We did like this before.
bright sweet red wine.
you are always such hurry.
you have married.
and have baby.
me? No.
but you have a girlfriend, right?
Yes.
I am not sure if I have a baby.
and this one also.
is it a problem?
you don't love her any more? No, No.
it is not this problem.
I don't know.
how can it be?
I am leaving.
Oh, she doesn't love you any more.
she should do so.
I don't know how you can leave like this.
do I know?
she is so independent.
I walked into the rain.
in fact...
in fact it is her baby.
sometimes when I think of that.
I want to say to you.
I don't know what I will lose.
I didn't know this when I was young.
it's like a dream before.
you look beautiful when you are laughing.
I miss you all the time.
really. But I don" want.
and it is very good imagination.
what on earth do you think?
I want to go to the places in the past.
I am thinking that I want to see you.
outside, when you invited me.
I saw it.
we want to return to the normal life.
I am sorry.
I am so pleased to see you.
you love me?
Tina, I have to tell you the whole thing.
and I am clear.
absolutely I don't have others in my heart.
I don't know whether I am right.
but I have made a decision.
where are you going?
to the edge of the world.
I took precautions.
please, Mark.
keep moving.
for an hour or so.
and I'll go hunting.
it's my trophy.
how?
keep walking.
your eyes.
I have to leave.
down here!
Yes.
I don't think so.
I'll find my friends, Brennidon?
I don't want you to go.
who you abandoned.
if he did come back.
mom.
the seeker from returning.
the seeker is my son.
I used protection.
you too.
all right, clear.
take him.
Yes, confessor.
Brigid.
Allard?
mark's agreed to help me.
split into two.
I tracked it for days.
you weren't.
never.
of course.
it wasn't a spell.
you've done well.
who are they?
leave us.
Why?
all right.
stop!
you know me?
see?
he's right.
we were close by.
Zedd,
maybe.
he's no child of mine!
sometimes for days.
are you Allard's father?
about what?
we had an agreement
Richard.
he doesn't even know me.
the mothers?
come on.
but the seeker was killed.
because if Richard knew, I have a plan.
no, no.
Michael.
go around the other side.
we'll search the houses again.
you won't find anything here.
he may not believe himself,
look at you.
I will now hear your dispute.
Richard...
I don't know.
silence her!
and by your honor as a confessor,
he had better be.
follow me.
you'll have a place of honor.
arrest him!
and take them to the town square.
...you're my mother?
I'm your brother.
you know the patrols, Mark.
but I only saw him once.
the seeker is within
I need your help.
she wants the people of Brennidon
these other women,
after he escaped from the cellar,
this is one crafty stag.
I'm surprised Zedd didn't tell me， what goes on here, friend?
how long since you've been there?
why didn't you warn him?
it's your turn.
his mother, perhaps?
if anyone knew he'd survived, Darken Rahl would have pursued him
I will release the other women.
if you surrender the army,
Hyah! Hyah!
probably no more than a day's ride.
the seeker among them.
I don't understand.
magical protection.
I didn't intend to.
we've received new orders.
no.
mark! Don't do this!
...Paternity.
who's next?
run, hide yourself!
mark!
to stand up for themselves.
guard: move along.
why did you pretend?
which way are you going?
and maybe we'll have taken the stag,
I ran the animal to the ground.
now let the women go.
it was craftier than we thought.
he'll send his assassins back.
you will be rewarded.
you'll spend time with your friend, if I told him we were near Brennidon, how could a boy like you capture him?
we'll gather more men.
I can see that neither of you is sure
you alerted me only after the seeker now!
Sylvia!
thank you.
No!
the stag was seen heading east.
you're the seeker.
he dies at midday.
Brigid!
that was before you were the seeker.
Yes.
but I'm not really your mother.
no, Zedd, of course not.
I'm not trying to help you.
he didn't expect us to be riding west.
I made it up.
you know of it?
but if I hadn't have come here,
that hunt for a lost spell.
Gethin's wife has been ill.
to the people that speak out.
now, seeker, why don't you tell him?
you must be under an illusion spell.
and teach him the ways of the world.
lesson number 15:
mark betrayed you.
tell them what happened in Brennidon.
it's going to upset the townspeople.
that's Brennidon, I think.
he would risk his own safety for mine.
because you defied his edicts
very good people.
there's only one thing I want.
rabbits?
to force the seeker out of hiding.
well, at least your excuses for leaving
I've heard the story.
I could hide him until nightfall, I'm sorry, Zedd. I...
okay.
you were just frightened.
their strength comes from their minds,
Matthias and I are heading out on a hunt.
than there were when we got here.
he could have men waiting there for him.
and when he died,
that's good, Allard.
of course you are.
he's got your coloring.
what do you want me to do?
she betrayed Brennidon.
and there's no possibility.
allard couldn't let go of his fear he speaks the truth.
besides, that's not true.
is friendly. Be careful.
what you did say to save that girl.
what were you thinking?
go!
why would I help you?
we'll find a way to help you.
it doesn't matter.
please, you have to come.
there are more people here now.
in attendance.
or it could be you.
confess us.
he's the most stubborn man I've ever met.
did the wizard give you to good people?
arrest her!
I searched for him everywhere.
you have what you wanted.
what do you mean?
this is Richard.
mother!
move along.
the seeker may have escaped.
well, where is he?
until now, I...
it's my own spell. It's foolproof.
of anyone else being Allard's father?
this is a horrible thing for a mother to say no one comes here.
and I won't be here to help.
he's my son.
he's a grown man.
so we're agreed, then. Hm.
take care of your mother.
not since I was a baby.
who are you? Show me your papers.
as you should have 23 years ago.
if they find him here, they'll execute us.
my father?
what was it?
and this magic, could it have failed?
people are terrified of Darken Rahl.
how does she know who's telling the truth?
so for the past 20 years,
if I turn myself in, move along.
I've caught the seeker. This way.
the seeker shall win their hearts.
don't you wanna find out?
and there were only two of us tracking it.
do you have any idea how much bad blood.
wo Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.
and I'll prove it.
you there.
and whoever hid him will hide him again.
maybe I should wait outside.
he was really tricking you?
Zedd, unless you're completely truthful, the D'harans killed him.
worthy prey. A 14-point buck.
then give the trophy to Gethin,
that if we submitted to Darken Rahl's rule,
we're searching every house in Brennidon.
I alerted you as soon as I knew
this is my final judgment.
whose arrow truly killed the creature.
come on, keep searching!
thanks for your help.
she can ferret out lies, and heal the rifts
and why should I do that?
mark!
Brigid.
or maybe you're just protecting the others.
before Darken Rahl wanted to kill you.
is there someone you both know who could use.
the prophecy of the seeker.
we'd be honored. What are you hunting?
we can find out.
I'm not your father.
we're going to get out of here.
the D'harans may return, Mark.
woman 4: No, he's my son!
I think we've all seen that Darken Rahl
even in the slightest way, we'll get it next time. Only two?
but I don't know if he's strong enough.
he will be in your hands before nightfall.
you. Where's your pass?
this place has been empty for years.
I was so scared.
richard: you were right. Zedd: about what?
as a child, you were fearless.
show me your papers. -move.
people abide by her judgments.
this one!
when you asked me if I was your mother, D'harans.
open the gates, spread the word.
clear the way!
pass?
you know it?
he defeated my best men. -so I tricked him.
listen to me.
the agreement was not for your benefit.
Zedd, they were so cold.
if we betray the seeker because we are afraid, you've taught us to stand up for ourselves.
that come from keeping secrets.
she's telling the truth.
I was born there.
thank you for helping me.
it is you.
I know I've been pushing you
Hyah!
you promised you wouldn't go off on your own.
well, they were going to kill her.
the city walls. He could not have escaped.
they're searching the houses now.
I have orders to search outside the gate.
I'm so sorry.
not in front of her.
not their bodies.
maybe ask the gatekeeper.
and now I understand why.
but I will never help you find him.
and his life is far more important.
now I have no choice but to bring in my own forces.
I might be able to get him to look the other way.
well, the stag turned west...
Brigid: Zedd.
they were just being foolish, I would have to tell the truth.
you would betray your own mother?
I really hoped that you were Allard's father.
that's good, Allard.
gathering her friends,
my mother never said my father was agreat wizard.
come on, who's next? Guard 3: come on.
it's the seeker!
hurry, there. Don't delay.
please, I can take you there.
had slipped through your fingers.
I knew that if you turned up, come on, people.
a terrible sight, isn't it?
we must cast rebels out publicly he must have decided.
okay, show me your papers.
I'm the one you're looking for!
and watched it die. The trophy is mine.
are you saying...
you can't just ride off on your own.
may your rebellious spirit
you told me my brother was dead.
I think I can help you.
listen to her.
what Mark did was a trick.
you were supposed to stay with the hunters.
I helped you! Leave her alone!
Oh, but his eyes,
he had to kill our children!
I'm so glad that I got to see you.
...no matter what happens,
I love him.
this woman is wise.
lord Rahl felt occupying the town might discourage and you used it every time?
make room! Make room!
to be there when you kill him.
he passed away. Not long after.
and maybe, now that you're here, wizards are strong.
Brennidon would be free of your forces.
I'd like it to remain buried.
this search for a mythical creature,
the health and good luck such a trophy would bring?
they're saying the seeker is in town.
not hers.
I can see they've raised a fine man.
richard can't. What?
Kahlan will be busy for days.
Zedd is not Allard's father.
but he was hiding something
a boar hunt. Sylvia: you never went you'd have said I was too young.
he's not my son!
I wouldn't have found my mother.
I truly am the seeker's mother.
wander the underworld for all time.
wo he's mine. He's my son.
lord Rahl will be pleased by your loyalty.
but the D'harans turned him against me.
back in hartland, I was on my own all the time,
ready to fulfill his destiny.
and forgive each other for this feud.
and everybody just does what she says?
I want to help you.
excuse us.
no pass, no entry.
you knowIi will.
my mother was arrested because of you.
and then one day, she disappeared.
I'm afraid I won't be staying, my dear.
you can't kill her just for speaking her mind.
because she's my mother too.
every time I look at him, I see you.
by the time you catch up with us.
until they killed my father.
to appease Rahl, but you saw what happens
how do you know this, boy?
Zedd, you said Richard was just going hunting.
patience, Richard.
but this time, your duty lies here.
he saved a girl's life.
where my parents lived.
I'm glad you're back, Zedd.
and then what?
nobody in Brennidon would dare.
the firstborn sons of Brennidon,
are you sure it worked?
the stag has led us further than I thought.
on a boar hunt. Allard: I was only 8.
you've got bigger things to do than look after one town.
your part of the bargain was to deliver him to us where's Richard?
I was right to come to you.
darken Rahl knows the seeker is from Brennidon.
you were in the throes of passion.
why is there such a crowd?
it was like my Owen had returned.
magical precautions.
to save her.
the sword of truth.
they've all defied Lord Rahl.
now he's turn west. Then let's go west.
Brigid: Mark.
when all this is over, I'm going to find her.
remember, not everyone in the midlands no amount of cajoling
can flow when people have no one to settle their disputes?
this valley hasn't seen a confessor in years.
then, then we will have stories to tell.
but I hardly dared to imagine.
I would never truly betray you.
keep to the main square, now.
twenty-three years have gone by
I want everyone in Brennidon and the outlying countryside in honoring what others most honor, he betrayed both of us.
that the seeker is not found!
she's protecting me.
everyone needed to think he was dead
at my side.
he's the seeker.
no seeker has surfaced.
they refused.
please. They were only trying to protect me.
but I'm hopeless as a hunter.
just let her go. This doesn't have to be a fight.
allowing those of us from the patrol to protect you.
arrest them all!
I've kept that secret buried for 20 years.
she often senses the truth without using her touch.
and now that I know that my mother is alive...
...Owen.
you promised you would never forget I've told him exactly what he needs to do.
wait. Give us some time.
now think about how helpless you felt I think she went to look for you.
he's lying, confessor. He only wounded the creature.
she is the seeker's mother.
alert the sentries! Close the gates!
so goes your fear.
Aha! Vixen. This Steffan must be the father.
woman 1: no, I am the seeker's mother!
Rahl didn't kill the children of this town.
it's your duty as his father to train him.
I will kill the seeker at midday.
I imagined that he was the one that had survived.
maybe the seeker's out there somewhere, what if instead of tricking the D'haran, think, Andrew.
nobody hopes more than I that we find Richard's mother.
come on, move along.
no, Mark, he wasn't.
and carry out the prophecy?
I am the seeker's mother!
and everyone was just going to stand around and watch?
and I will kill another for every hour I never saw her again.
I thought we were leagues from the nearest town.
if I'm asked on a hunt,
you go back to your life?
Brennidon's west,
guard 1: Papers, please. Guard 2: All right, clear.
a confessor has power beyond her magic.
about her own child.
bring it to the surface.
Yes, confessor.
I couldn't let him destroy Brennidon.
this young woman insisting on the lessons. The training.
I'd never even heard of the D'harans
all these children were murdered because of it,
has been preaching heresy.
I can't.
once you're gone-- then the D'harans will go too?
many of us think that it's wrong to give up our freedom someone hid him 23 years ago.
you said you were traveling east.
Gavin and Matthias will be with me. It's not safe.
the seeker went this way.
the seeker stood up to the patrols this morning.
the prophecy was not averted.
he asked the town elders to identify which child.
it was my arrow that killed it.
couldn't you get one of them to help us?
do your parents still live there?
if the D'harans return, they'll get a fight.
will do anything to bring peace to the midlands.
to turn himself in.
your mother is alive?
and she's the one who's tried to hide him from you.
and our children have died for nothing.
were always more interesting than most men's.
your son.
the patrols are to gather the mothers of the firstborn.
keep moving.
what I saw in Brennidon made me realize what I'm facing.
that legend will live on if you kill me.
I will always love you like a son, I can't absolve you of your responsibility to Allard.
you're a crafty old devil, Zedd.
the D'harans. They've come back.
and I know that giving in won't stop them.
and then the wizard took you away.
I wonder which house was mine, but we don't know who the seeker's mother is.
she's not my mother anymore.
she doesn't want to say this,
that night at the fire springs.
there was another man, uh, Steffan,
your mother comes home and everything returns to normal?
you didn't lose your skills.
I was the midwife at your birth.
Oh, so when it's convenient, you remember your lessons.
by the time you'd even thought of taking precautions.
uh, I told Zedd I'd stay with you.
I heard there was a wizard in the camp,
and with the flames,
ready to rise up and defeat Darken Rahl.
the D'harans have captured the seeker.
Brennidon?
Yes, but that didn't concern your dispute.
until he could fulfill his destiny as the seeker.
you've always had some higher calling to follow.
there only way to do that is to turn yourself in.
you were wrong, D'haran.
hunting is their most honored tradition.
I'm sorry I had to make you tell me something you didn't want to.
I didn't mean to say yes.
if I recall, it was more than one night.
you'll be safe in the cellar.
you have chosen to live by certain standards.
until I made him think magic had driven it out.
but now the seeker is back,
so I can't fairly award the trophy to either of you.
what kind of spell was that?
and now people are scared that if they anger Rahl, I did hold you as a baby, the night you were born.
so did Brennidon's future.
his whole life, he's listened
face the seeker as a grown man who could defend himself
when the boar attacked you.
telling them that Lord Rahl is not our true leader.
the seeker has until sunrise.
feed your fear to the fire.
and someday I'm gonna have a family again.
trying to help a misguided friend.
then the children of Brennidon died for nothing!
her sacrifice means nothing.
a confessor is the highest moral authority in the midlands.
you must never tell Richard.
so Lord Rahl knows we will never defy him again.
...with your own sword.
she was very ill for a while, but she lived.
he was 3.
and someday, when all this is over and then you will die for your treachery.
your mother wants a better life for you.
but it wouldn't hurt to take a look around.
Rahl gave a warning before the massacre.
as you both agreed to abide by the covenant of the confessor, I couldn't bear to think about his death.
concentrate on the flames.
so now I know exactly what they're capable of.
so Rahl massacred all the children.
was there an occasion when you didn't use your magic?
Where's that stag? I'm hungry for venison.
what was Lord Rahl to do?
did something happen to make you fearful?
and I'm going to do whatever it takes to be ready.
but I went with Rolant and Rolant.
I got caught between them and the boar, and...
he thinks he's keeping Brennidon safe.
at least now, I know that he didn't die for nothing.
I didn't realize what growing up who would feel such loyalty to the seeker?
the fire consumes your fear.
mark? Don't call for the patrol. Just listen to me.
the rest of us will find the strength to stand with you.
it's a matter of...
the only thing the D'harans care about is the seeker.
you heard what your mother said back in the town square.
woman 2: No, he's my son! Woman 3: He's my son.
and to show the people of this town that Lord Rahl is merciful,
you, however, will die alongside your son.
was the seeker, turn him over.
move along. Keep walking.
unless you confess whatever it is that you're hiding, and Brennidon is the last place
I held you in my arms the night you were born,
you've heard of it? It's not just a story.
no one else has had the courage to do that.
and I have another brother, back in hartland.
either way, they all defied Lord Rahl and must be punished.
what about my real mother...?
but he believes in the power of a great wizard.
Zedd, I want you to meet Allard.
give the seeker to me.
you will watch your son die,
so you let these patrols control everything you do and say?
the prophecy, at last, is averted.
you're honor bound to tell a confessor the truth.
this girl thinks she knows better than the town elders.
you question the magic of a wizard of the first order?
mark needs to be at the platform at the execution.
so if he lives, he's a coward,
I called you Owen, after your father.
if he does not, I will kill one of these women.
you're a very capable young man.
and Mark would do anything to save you.
I thought he might be happier with you.
but it was necessary for the greater good.
then everyone can go back to their lives.
and there's nothing I want more than to tell him the truth.
and Rahl is advancing through the midlands.
I was there when Zedd took you from your mother's arms.
I am going to kill you, seeker...
so when I saw you in the square, it was...
what I want is simple.
what happened here 23 years ago was a tragedy.
we all know the consequences of defying Lord Rahl.
but until then, he cannot know that I'm his grandfather.
murdered by Darken Rahl's men to avert a prophecy.
the legend of the seeker seems to be greater than the man.
Richard, I'm sorry.
I want you to summon the fear that you've held for so long.
but it was suddenly as if I was looking at my own lost son...
I can give, please.
Zeddicus.
dare I ask,
how was that?
how do I know which one?
fine.
are there caves near here?
where are you going?
back to the tavern.
you could be out there doing it now,
you ran away at the moment you were needed most.
and we need to find zedd.
Yeah.
it's all I have left of him.
only to me.
rada han.
must be valuable.
my lady.
but it won't last, you'd better hurry.
there must be something else.
you have nothing else I want.
what did you see?
my little friend will.
you told me to leave the village.
I'll save you!
if I'd known it was you, I will protect you.
lesson number four.
that must be it.
one word from me and
leave?
he was underground,
but I love you too much, you weren't really protecting yourself?
Kahlan!
there are dozens of boys.
you're the seeker.
he was just a boy.
Richard!
I told you to leave.
Richard.
get out of here, now!
Richard.
do you?
where did you--?
one vial.
all right.
the potion will lead you.
Yeah.
