really, I'm just excited for the wheelchair race.
you were smart not to enter. Never in, never lose.
and since you no longer have stones.
I'll split the 50 a week with you.
deal.
honey, I'm home!
let's get back to Phil and Diane.
Phil's been having a hard time finding work, and Diane wants him to talk to her about his fear, his disappointment.
and Phil wants Diane to trust him that they'll get through this, ideally, without having to keep discussing feelings.
not your exact words, but am I wrong?
and most guys out there are the same way, but ladies, if you're feeling frustrated, remember, it's not our fault.
we were raised to be strong, not emotional, to deny vulnerability, not embrace it.
and do you know what that makes us?
dinosaurs.
nobody needs us to hunt wild animals for food.
nobody needs us to cut down trees to build shelter.
they need us to evolve, to catch up.
since the 1960s, women's roles have shifted radically.
and as--uh, as their-- in--as their roles have changed, so have women, they've-- they've, uh
well, they've become tougher, and more demanding of us.
they're partners.
And--and--who can blame them? Who--who can
who can, uh...
expecting us to...
to do this...
we need an ambulance.
you want?
I'm good.
your limp's almost gone.
it pains me to interrupt the collegial banter, it pains me even more to listen to it continue.
38-year-old man.
spikes a fever and collapses during a speaking engagement.
E. R. checks out blood volume, cardiac function, and autonomic reflexes, all normal.
patient makes a living telling men to behave more like women.
I'm surprised you didn't throw psych symptoms into the differential.
either way, could be a cerebral AVM.
E. R. did a head CT. No sign of AVM.
decent thought, though.
the patient's philosophy makes perfect sense.
its only flaw is that it's impossible.
evolution does not work that way.
you can't talk legs onto a fish.
we're gonna go extinct, and we're gonna do it drinking scotch and driving muscle cars.
am I right?
am I--thank you.
cephalic fibromuscular dysplasia?
it doesn't explain the fever.
the patient's talking about compromise.
if you don't think that's possible, you don't think relationships are possible.
anyone in this room in a position to disprove that?
this guy's just playing to his audience.
women are, by far, the biggest consumers of the self-help industry.
he could have a pulmonary embolism.
clot in his lung increases right ventricular afterload, drops the blood flow to his brain.
we should do a pulmonary angiogram.
patient lacks major risk factors for a P. E.
doesn't rule it out, just makes it unlikely.
maybe we start with a D-dimer?
less invasive than the angiogram.
good idea.
fine.
now, I am hereby searching for a number two.
so I'm eating a lot of Bran.
also, I want a team leader.
someone to fill Foreman's old job.
Why?
you're right. We don't need any more structure.
it's not like we had a near-fatal stabbing.
well, if it isn't the old ball and Ukraine.
who's that?
his wife.
you survived prison.
and you Atlantic City, where they also have gangs and pruno, but slightly less recidivism.
I start Ukrainian food truck business.
after gambling--win, lose-- everybody likes a little knish.
I'm assuming there's a connection.
our green card interview is in four days.
they come to the apartment, they ask questions about marriage, vacations, family history, what side of the bed each sleep on.
we've never taken a vacation,
I don't like your family, and on top.
I hear Kiev is lovely this time of year.
and your mother, who may or may not be dead, for all I know, misses you.
can it be that genius doctor is afraid to take on a silly government apparatchik?
well, I would say more not interested than afraid, but why quibble?
then I go to plan "B."
make you an offer that cannot be refused.
how long you been doing seminars?
the marriage counseling, just, uh, the past couple years.
before that, I did corporate coaching.
can't imagine the same advice works for both audiences.
guess you shifted with the market?
there's nothing cynical about my husband. He and I
no, it's okay. I get it.
what guy thinks men should be more like women?
a macho jerk who got a big wake-up call courtesy of three drunks who beat the crap outta me outside a sports bar in Milwaukee.
I'm guessing that explains the broken wrist in your medical history?
those morons did me the biggest favor of my life.
I realized I'd sacrificed my health because I couldn't back down from an argument over football.
meeting Marlene was the final piece in the puzzle.
she changed my career, my diet.
she gave me a whole new direction in life.
we'll need to know exactly how you changed your diet, and when.
need my apartment key back.
if you're breaking up with me, can we at least talk about it first?
maybe if you weren't all nag and no shag.
I don't sleep with married men.
I'll get a copy made.
you're an ex-con.
if you get caught perjuring yourself to Homeland Security, you'll end up back in jail.
and that would be troubling if there was the slightest chance that we'd get caught.
you barely know each other.
you've got about five minutes to remake yourselves into a convincing married couple.
and why?
Dominika gets a green card. What's in this for you?
this is what men do for the women they pretend to love.
also, she's paying me 30, 000 bucks once we pass.
apparently knishes sell like hotcakes.
lab results.
afraid you're gonna have to finish your nag later.
I said I think it's stupid, right?
then I think I'm done.
d-dimer came back normal. Rules out pulmonary embolism.
and our patient's a true believer about the follies of masculinity.
he underwent a spiritual overhaul three years ago.
he also went off gluten and red meat.
unfortunately, that doesn't explain any of his symptoms.
one of those points is not absurd.
what's absurd about a change of heart?
what this guy believes is making him a better person.
he's going against his baser instincts.
"base" meaning foundational.
meaning things we are biologically programmed to do.
Yes, perfectly natural that he stopped doing that stuff.
you know, that's the kind of lapse that could take you out of the running for team leader.
I feel surprisingly okay with that.
comes with a 50-buck-a-week raise.
I'm in.
you don't want to do that.
might need your dignity later in life.
you didn't.
and she could be on her way to living the dream unless the rest of you nut up and give her this spiritual overhaul...
did it come after a physical overhaul?
a major injury of some kind?
bar fight.
but there's no way a broken wrist explains
adams, come with me.
you too.
you guys...
get a copy of that made.
did those dudes bend your ball sack like Beckham?
three years ago. The bar fight.
this is Dr. House. He has a theory.
Oh, Dr. Adams, would you mind?
I asked you a question. I assume you know the answer.
Yeah, I took a couple serious knees to the groin.
what has gotten into me?
Dr. Chase.
just pick it up.
do you know what's wrong with me?
nothing that The Golden Girls couldn't have handled in 23 hilarious minutes.
you had a hot flash.
those guys kicked your guys hard enough to do lasting damage.
you didn't even look when presented with two reasonably attractive tuchi.
Yeah, I said it!
I was listening to my doctor.
people generally listen with their ears, leaving their eyes free to wander.
I'm guessing that your testosterone level is just below "Bieber.
do a blood test to confirm, and STT hormone replacement.
it's no wonder that you think women are so great.
you've basically been one for the last three years.
tests confirm House is right.
low testosterone explains all your symptoms.
they should go away with replacement therapy.
uh, we're gonna give you a fairly high dose.
over time, your personal physician may reduce it a little.
just need you to turn around.
will the shots increase his libido?
are you worried about that?
no.
have you been unsatisfied?
no. No, it's just...
well, it's usually me that initiates things.
sometimes I-I think maybe you aren't that attracted to me.
are you crazy?
with these injections, you will see an increase in sex drive.
okay, great. -- Yeah.
all done. -- Okay.
Oh, something's wrong.
I think I peed myself.
is that from the testosterone?
it couldn't be.
I don't think you're going home just yet.
it's not a plumbing problem.
means it's probably neurological.
And?
and name Dominika's three brothers.
Volodymyr, Oleksiy, and...
low testosterone is off the table as a symptom.
guy got his nuts cracked three years ago.
don't need to look much further than that.
so his hose just happens to spring a leak at the same time he's in a hospital for a totally unrelated problem.
it's Fedir.
if low testosterone means I can't get sick with something else, then punch me in the junk right now.
I would, if it weren't redundant.
is Fedir the one who married Mykola?
mykola is Dominika's uncle.
how is it you can retain every detail of our habits and personal lives, and none of this?
cause I find it hard to remember things I don't give a crap about.
ergo, Dominika has one brother, and his name is Al.
maybe the testicular damage set the stage for something worse.
multiple Sclerosis causes incontinence, and progresses faster in men with low T.
way to stay on point.
it's that kind of leadership that's putting you at the head of the pack.
there is no pack. She's the only applicant.
well, that's settled, then.
have your underlings do an LP and get a cranio-spinal MRI to check for plaques associated with M. S.
I will go tell Foreman about your promotion.
wait.
so nobody cares about the job till I apply, and suddenly it's the last limited-edition lightsaber at Comic-Con.
just seems like it should go to someone with more...
seniority.
meaning you.
I said "more," not "most."
meaning you or Taub.
house is a dictator.
second in command is a meaningless position.
doesn't look meaningless on my resume.
doesn't have to be meaningless at all.
the right person could turn it into something.
get the department running smoothly.
I wonder who that "right person" could be.
house is the head of the department.
it's only fair that a woman should hold the other position of authority.
Yeah, let's go affirmative action on this, because then I'll definitely win.
this is what House wants.
wind us up and watch us fight over an empty title, which would make us extra stupid because of what we've just been through.
we should let him choose whoever he wants and move on.
so if these proteins are in my spinal fluid, that means I have M. S?
proteins may indicate M. S.
there's no one definitive test.
that's why Dr. House ordered an MRI as well.
this is anesthetic.
it's a scary diagnosis.
but advances are being made.
several drugs approved just this year.
to be honest, at the moment,
I'm feeling a little more worried about the testosterone injections.
it's making me feel, uh, different.
just kind of amped.
I went through this big life change, and it felt really...
meaningful.
but what if it was all just chemistry?
loss of testosterone could have been a factor, but think of it as a catalyst.
it got you to reevaluate. Now you know what's important.
you can choose to hold onto that.
right?
it's certainly worth trying.
deep breath, stay very still.
just tell House to drop the whole team leader thing.
that's the only way it'll go away.
I don't think it's such a bad idea.
a little more structure in your department couldn't hurt.
house is doing this because of his great love of structure, not because he wants us to turn on each other.
so don't do that.
it makes sense to have someone in there with a little more accountability.
as long as it's not Adams.
she sees the whole thing as an opportunity to remake the department in her image.
or Park, for obvious reasons.
and Taub's got the kids. He's pretty busy.
are you seriously angling for a job that you mocked its fate the whole time I had it?
I don't want the job.
you just don't want anyone else to have it.
this'll be great.
your grandmother's kind of sexy.
that is Taras Shevchenko, the greatest Ukrainian poet.
is he the guy behind "There once was a man from Kremenchuk"?
help me move coffee table.
well, then where will we have coffee?
and by "coffee" I mean scotch.
coffee and booze are artificial high for me.
high is in exercise.
dance aerobics. Fun, and good for the butt.
Amy Grant?
I know.
but there's a hot girl jumping up and down in my living room, so...
you have a limited amount of time to learn a ton of uninteresting facts.
welcome to my wheelhouse.
you brought a protractor?
you never know when you might need to make a pie chart.
looks like someone is currying favor for the team leader position.
Yes.
we'll be using a basic alphabet technique with a mnemonic multiplier.
in high school, they called me "The Bookie Monster."
[Cheering and Shouting] On your right, on your right.
back, back, back.
back, back, back, back
watch the winger!
[muffled] You ok? Dan, Dan, talk to me. Dan, Dan, get a doctor!
1X02: PATERNITY Original Airdate on FOX: November 23, 2004
Hey!
close the door. Close the door!
is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?
she's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she commanded;
she just doesn't know I'm alone.
well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?
I'm off at 4: 00.
you're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?
I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose.
that's 30 seconds looking at the nose;
25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor.
Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying.
just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.
that would be lying.
and that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.
not the definition of case though.
you have no cases?
you have NO cases?
you've got hand picked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?
cameron is answering my mail.
time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?
research?
9 letters, iodine deficiency in children.
Cretinism.
so, 4: 03 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down.
Dr. House.
sorry, done for the day. There's plenty of docs here to take care of you.
but we had an appointment.
hah, nice try, but this is a walk in clinic, which means there are no appointments.
it means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me.
but your letter says that we would see you.
not a big letter writer.
here.
when did my signature get so girly?
I can explain.
see that "G," see how it makes a big loop on top?
it doesn't even look like my handwriting.
think I have something?
what's the differential diagnosis for writing "G"s like a junior high school girl?
it's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called...
perseverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun.
Low-rider jeans are hot.
16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause.
the kid's been to 2 neurologists
night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?
Yes.
where are you going?
to see the family.
you're going to examine a patient?
9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family.
good work.
margins look fine.
no lesions, color is good.
how long have you been having night terrors?
three weeks.
he's afraid to go to bed, he's exhausted, he can barely function.
what does that tell you?
nothing, it's just fun watching him blink.
name as many animals that begin with the letter "B," go.
baby elephant.
baby elephant is actually a good answer; "B" is a bear of a letter.
what does that tell you?
proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is never going to be chief fry cook.
in teens there are two likely causes of night terrors:
post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?
no.
well, then, Dave, if there's no trauma, the other cause is sexual abuse.
so, who's molesting you?
teacher, extra friendly neighbor?
I'd ask if either one of you were involved, but you'd deny it.
we would never do anything to hurt Dan.
I say it here, it comes out there.
this lack of response is consistent with abuse.
there's no one, ok? I swear.
there was trauma; I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.
did you know that he got hit in the head?
they didn't mention it, no.
Yeah, why bother.
no, no, we took him to the E.R. after the game.
he was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine.
no concussion, it's gotta be something else.
you hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis.
cool. E.R. obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion.
I had double vision before I got hit.
well, that changes everything, you need glasses.
that's why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors.
you need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.
you enjoyed that.
I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.
you're an only child, aren't you?
why would you say that?
everything is about you.
this may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad.
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus.
I'm not an only child.
interesting.
what?
don't move.
did I bore you in there?
what? Ah, no, not, not really. - Are you tired?
sometimes.
he never sleeps! Of course he's tired.
right now, at this moment, are you tired? - No, no.
that twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
didn't hurt.
his leg twitched. I don't see what...
it's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep.
respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.
so?
so, he's not asleep, he's awake.
admit him.
I recognize that loopy "G."
so, what does the jerk tell us?
nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body.
can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscles.
a movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease.
either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.
maybe not that bad, could be an infection.
you wish. No fever, no white count.
anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?
I took an accurate family history.
you didn't even take an accurate family.
his father's not his father.
why would you say that?
30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.
from what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.
that's what our mom's would like us to believe.
who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?
$50 bucks says I'm right.
I'll take your money.
hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.
make it $100.
what about leucoencephalopathy? In a 16 year old.
it doesn't necessarily have to be that bad.
if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.
Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.
the night terrors were anecdotal. He could have had a bad dream.
no, parents said he was conscious during the event and didn't remember anything afterwards.
that's a night terror.
parents said?
that's a good point.
before we condemn this kid, maybe we should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.
I want a detailed polysomnograph.
if he's having night terrors I want to see them.
I usually don't move during night terrors.
I'm not restraining you for them.
eeg revealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
what are you doing?
fixing it.
can I talk to my parents?
Oh, they know all about this.
I'd really like to see them.
please! I'd really like them here.
this is gonna hurt, Dan.
Oh, God!
that's a night terror.
we did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray.
all the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.
OK, but let's pretend there's something and go from there.
who sees something on this MRI?
no lesions, no white matter.
no structural abnormalities.
no space-occupying tumors.
he's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain.
the smallest thing is abnormal.
meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.
excellent, you see what he did there?
he took a small clue that there's a neurological problem and wasn't afraid to run with it.
there's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.
no, there's not, he completely wrong.
then what clue are you talking about?
he knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess.
clever, but also pathetic.
so, what did you find?
take a close look at the corpus callosum.
it looks ok.
are we all looking at the same thing?
200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain.
it's subtle.
there's some bowing, there. An upward arch.
are you guessing?
Yes.
too bad, you're right.
he probably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.
Yeah, he probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position.
something is pushing on it.
if there's bowing it could be a tumor.
do you see a tumor on this MRI?
no, but I don't see any bowing, either.
there's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms.
today night terrors, tomorrow he's bleeding out of his eyes.
get him a radionucleotide cisternogram. I guarantee you'll see a blockage.
OK... all right easy...
now, I'm injecting a material that's tagged with a radioactive isotope.
it's gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain.
it'll make you able to think deep thoughts, at about 100 miles per hour.
easy.
their eyes aren't the same color, but that fleck in the eyes...
that's maybe a one in ten chance if they're not related?
Nah, House isn't gonna pay you based on that.
[Chuckles] Any excuse we can give the folks to justify a DNA test?
we could tell them he's got Huntington's.
the whole family should be tested or they'll all die.
Hey, there's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.
we're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.
no more pressure, everything goes back to normal.
he's lucky to have you as his doctors.
no formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.
yummy.
her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.
Mmhmm. No fever, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.
we're not vaccinating.
think they don't work?
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work.
pad their bottom line.
Mmmm. May I?
sure.
all natural no dies. That's a good business: all-natural children's toys.
those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs.
they don't lie about how much they spend in research and development.
the worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.
you know another really good business?
teeny tiny baby coffins.
you can get them in frog green or fire-engine red.
really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you.
they think that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive.
want to change things? Prove them wrong.
a few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, believe me, prices will drop REALLY fast.
tell me what she has.
a cold.
there's a problem.
complications in surgery?
surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.
Really?
turns out the bowing wasn't the cause of his problems, it was a symptom.
Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.
which means multiple sclerosis.
and the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
because we're having a disagreement about whether or not it is MS.
no lesions on the MRI.
it's early; he's had the disease for maybe two weeks.
mcdonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.
Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.
McDonald.
Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.
the VEP indicates slowing of the brain.
without the lesions we can't be sure.
well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indicate rapidly progressive MS.
we should wait until we
start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5.
break it to the family. I'm going home.
it'll take months for a definitive diagnosis.
what'll happen to me?
ms is an incredibly variable disease, if it is MS, and we're not 100% sure.
what do you think is gonna happen?
there are some medications to manage the symptoms, but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe:
bowel and bladder dysfunction, loss of cognitive function, pain.
it's gonna hurt?
the brain's like a big jumble of wires.
ms strips them of the insulation, and the nerves die.
the brain interprets it as pain, but by starting treatment we're gonna avoid that for as long as possible.
we're looking into a couple specialists, and until we get you squared away you'll stay here.
security checked the videotapes for all the perimeter cameras;
he's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?
main floor.
OK, you take the cafeteria and administration.
I'll hit the research annex and work my way back to you.
I'm not here. Leave a message.
Dr. Cuddy, great outfit.
what are you doing back here? Patient?
no, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.
Dr. House, Dan's missing.
Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately.
he shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.
I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache.
that would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.
we wanted to keep you informed.
he heard some pretty heavy news.
this is not a toddler wandering around a department store.
he's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.
so, when you say "Call me if you need anything," You mean, "Don't call me."
no, I mean "Call me if I can do something."
I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.
what about his parents? Should we call them?
Why? You think they're hiding him?
make sure someone checks the roof;
some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dan? You ok?
there are experimental treatments, ongoing research...
who knows what they'll discover in a year or two?
this is where I dropped the ball.
Dan, we're standing on the roof of the hospital!
Dan! Dan, you're not on the field!
he doesn't know where he is.
Dr. Foreman.
I assume you found the kid.
he almost walked off the roof.
suicidal?
no, he thought he was on his lacrosse field.
look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change...
conscious?
Yeah.
how'd you talk him down?
actually, Chase tackled him.
how come you didn't do it?
right, well, I am black, but he was closer.
come on, you can ride up with me.
anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
they're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.
why does everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?
this is great news! He doesn't have MS.
the parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway.
of course, the dad probably doesn't know
why doesn't he have MS?
he was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this?
Yeah, sure.
he was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS.
the Oligoclonal bands.
were real. They just mean something other than MS.
so, what are they telling us?
that the immune system is working.
right, he has an infection in his brain.
what about sex?
well, it might get complicated.
we work together.
I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.
heh, nice cover.
sorry, RPR was negative.
we don't need a definitive test to confirm this.
sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.
OK, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush.
so the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?
well, it is. If it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%.
I'll start him on IV penicillin.
we're not going to wait for that.
the most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
we can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him.
no neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.
show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?
and who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
who thinks there's a third option?
very good, what's the third choice?
no idea, you just asked if I thought there was one.
[Sighs] The patient has a shunt in his brain.
there'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.
excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.
one of us is going to do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks.
he could get syphilis even if he's not sexually active?
well, it's unusual, but it's possible.
relax.
Geesh.
it's infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.
I wouldn't do that.
although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail.
steak knife?
wife's nail file.
nail File.
Yeah, pain'll make you do stupid things.
something to take the edge off?
Yeah.
Cheers.
so, do you have family here in Princeton?
no.
here on work?
no, why are you
does your penis hurt?
no. What? Should it?
no, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question.
your lawyer's gonna love it.
why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.
you're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?
Yeah.
now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose?
it's the free flowing puss that's the tip off.
I was in town.
not for family, not for work.
you drove 70 miles to a walk-in-clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road.
now, either you have a problem with those hospitals, or they have a problem with you.
my guess is that you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood, and the rest are now refusing to treat you.
it's ironic, isn't it?
it's like the boy who sued wolf.
you know what? I bet we have a doctor here named Wolfe.
how perfect would that be?
I'm gonna page him.
OK, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.
we'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up.
why would you do that?
I'm a people person.
you actually treated him?
all I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them.
the cutest little tennis outfit, my God I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
Oh my, I didn't see you there, that is so embarrassing.
how's your hooker doing?
Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.
I heard you found her on the roof.
you have very acute hearing.
you notify the parents?
in due course, of course.
and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?
doesn't sound like me.
well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.
you think?
I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.
my guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.
and if I win, no clinic hours for a week.
my guy will call your guy.
she's very good at her job.
the treatments should start helping soon.
let us know if it gets easier to focus on things, remember stuff.
Hey, Dan, isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace a beauty?
something South American, I think.
Yeah, Guatemalan.
it's a cool necklace.
thank you so much.
the kid's in pain.
don't fight it. - Just let it happen.
no.
no, what? - You'll be dead in three days.
I give it a day.
Dan? You ok?
he's hearing voices.
come on! Dan!
get OUT OF MY HEAD!
auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration.
penicillin's not working.
so, either it's a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong.
square one. "Midnight."
l. F. T.s, B. U. N. , and creatinine, are all normal, diabetes is out. No gap.
there goes metabolic.
MRI rules out vasculitis.
I" for inflammation.
to young for anything degenerative.
"d," see ya. "N" for neoplastic?
MRI was clean.
I" for inflammation.
we already did that.
stupid to have two I's in one mneumonic.
what's the other one?
infection.
Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
but no fevers; white count's elevated but within range.
and we've tested for anything remotely possible.
everything is negative.
ct scan rules out subdural.
trauma, later much.
you know the problem?
midnight is actually spelled with a "G" and an "H."
if we could just figure out what those two letters stand for.
it's a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him.
scaring the hell out of him.
get him an EEG, left and right EOG, esophageal microphones.
if this thing wants to talk, let's listen.
we're missing something.
this is screwed up.
that's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?
I panicked, ok?
sounded cool though, they bought it.
Oh, crap.
another reason I don't like meeting patients.
if they don't know that you look like they can't yell at you.
here we go.
how can you just sit there?
if I eat standing up, I spill.
our son is dying, and you could care less?
we're going through hell; you're doing nothing?
I'm sorry, you need to vent, I understand.
don't be condescending.
you haven't checked in on him once.
blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads.
LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range.
Oh yeah, and he's hearing voices.
go hold his hand.
go on; I'll bus your tray.
got any sample bags on you?
I don't believe you. You're gonna run DNA tests?
their son is deathly ill, I know it's terrible, but the fact is if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this I'm afraid I might start to cry.
you're an ass.
yeah? You want to double the bet?
general Hospital is on channel 6.
Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now, only mush.
no epileptiform activity.
what are you doing?
waiting for CBC and Chem-7.
good, run DNA on these.
what's this?
parents' coffee cups.
I can't believe you
I've had this conversation once already.
if you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.
Dr. House?
Hey, Mr. Funsten!
I was wondering when you'd be back.
got some papers for me?
you've caused me considerable mental distress.
I certainly hope so.
what? Too cheap to have your lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.
you have gonorrhea.
no, I don't!
well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do.
it could be a false positive; normally I'd run a second test, but since you're here I'll just go with the first.
you're just trying to scare me.
it's reportable you know, public health issue.
I'll be sure to let my wife know.
Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you.
look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal.
there's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors run a test.
these are mine now.
I'll see you in court.
west Nile negative, not surprising, since not too many mosquitoes passing through Jersey in December.
no Eastern Equine Encephalitis.
you guys aren't going to believe this.
what's that?
house was right, the father's not the father.
[Sighs] Dude doubled up on me.
you're not gonna believe this, the mother's not the mother either.
it's not a good idea to move your son in his condition.
we just want a second opinion.
we need an answer.
you idiots!
you lied to me!
we didn't lie about anything.
you, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son.
perfect.
can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs?
theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.
we're his parents.
he was adopted. He doesn't need to know.
I do.
adoption makes him just as much as
listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused?
did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition, or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?
how did you find out about this?
I sampled their DNA.
we didn't give you any DNA.
your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
you can't do that!
again, why are we getting hung up on what I did?
your medical history is useless.
no, we gave you a detailed history of his biological mother.
her history;
non-smoker, good health, low cholesterol, no blood pressure problems.
Dan was adopted two weeks after he was born. You have his history.
there's nothing you need to know that we didn't tell you.
sounds reasonable.
well, if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice, but I still think it's the wrong
was she vaccinated?
the biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?
Dan was vaccinated at 6 months.
Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months?
because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system.
so, was she vaccinated?
an infant picks up a regular old measles virus.
he gets a rash, he's extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fever, but he lives.
here's the kicker, once every million or so times, the virus mutates.
instead of Dan having a fever and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb.
in this case for 16 years.
subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis.
I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one.
once SSPE moves to stage two
boom, stage two is universally fatal.
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.
he's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight.
can we treat it?
ask the neurologist.
intraventricular interferon.
we're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.
we won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after everything we've given him.
why do people lie to me?
it could also kill him.
your ball, Foreman, tell me I don't have to biopsy his brain.
well, there is one other way.
you sure this isn't gonna hurt?
Yeah, it's just scary as hell.
see, we go through the pupil.
you won't feel it; the eye's been paralyzed.
the needle travels to the back of the eye which is where we perform the biopsy on your retina.
so we've confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus.
the treatment for SSPE is intra-ventricular interferon.
we implant an Ommaya reservoir under the scalp, which is connected to a ventricular catheter that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere
look, you want us to consent to this?
I don't even understand what you're talking about.
well, the antiviral
look, I'm sorry,
I can explain this as best I can, but the notion that you're gonna fully understand your son's treatment and make an informed decision, is, it's kinda insane.
now, here's what you need to know, it's dangerous, it could kill him, you should do it.
you can't order a $3, 200 DNA test to win a bet.
it's not an actual cost.
I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.
I'm serious.
well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.
insurance is not going to pay for a bet.
it should. If we don't make that bet, the kid dies.
if not for the paternity bet, I never would have taken their DNA, without their DNA we never would have discovered that Dan was adopted, which was the key to this case.
you just don't want to pay your end.
big mistake. My guy knows a guy.
fine. I will let you out of clinic duty for one week, after you pay the $3, 200 for the PCR test.
Whoo.
well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson.
very bitter.
Hey, good morning.
good news on your EEG, treatment is working.
and your immune system is responding.
I know it's early, but let me take a look.
let's see what that brain of yours can do.
name as many animals as you can that start with the letter "O."
ostrich, ox, old elephant.
well, that's 2 better then last time.
how you doing with the whole adoption thing?
I knew since 5th grade.
how's that?
cleft chin.
I have one, my dad doesn't.
I looked it up on the Internet; it's one of those trait things.
that's right, it's autosomal dominant.
since neither of your parents have cleft chins, it's highly unlikely that you're biologically related.
you sure you're ok?
I've got no problems with being adopted.
I love my parents.
how's he doing?
he's doing pretty well.
he's a smart kid.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Thanks.
wheels, one-eight! Wheels!
[Cheering and Shouting] On your right, on your right.
back, back, back.
[Continues cheering and shouting]
back, back, back, back
watch the winger!
[More cheering and whistling]
[muffled] You ok? Dan, Dan, talk to me. Dan, Dan, get a doctor!
Hey!
close the door. Close the door!
is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?
she's known I'm in here, the clinic, as she commanded;
she just doesn't know I'm alone.
well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?
I'm off at 4: 00.
you're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?
I go out there. I get assigned a kid with a runny nose.
that's 30 seconds looking at the nose;
25 minutes talking to a worried mom who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor.
Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying.
just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.
that would be lying.
and that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.
not the definition of case though.
you have no cases?
you have NO cases?
you've got hand picked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?
cameron is answering my mail.
time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?
research?
9 letters, iodine deficiency in children.
Cretinism.
so, 4: 03 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down.
Dan's Dr. House.
sorry, done for the day. There're plenty of doctors here to take care of you.
but we had an appointment.
hah, nice try, but this is a walk in clinic, which means there are no appointments.
it means you walk in, sign the chart and a doctor will see you, just not me.
but your letter says that we would see you.
not a big letter writer.
here.
when did my signature get so girly?
I can explain.
see that "G," see how it makes a big loop on top?
it doesn't even look like my handwriting.
think I have something?
what's the differential diagnosis for writing "G"'s like a junior high school girl?
it's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called...
perseverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun.
Low-rider jeans are hot.
16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause.
the kid's been to 2 neurologists.
night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?
Yes.
where are you going?
to see the family.
you're going to examine a patient?
9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family.
good work.
margins look fine.
no lesions, color is good.
how long have you been having night terrors?
three weeks.
he's afraid to go to bed, he's exhausted, and he can barely function.
what does that tell you?
nothing, it's just fun watching him blink.
name as many animals that begin with the letter "B" go.
baby elephant.
baby elephant is actually a good answer; "B" is a bear of a letter.
what does that tell you?
proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is never going to be chief fry cook.
in teens there are two likely causes of night terrors: post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school?
no.
well, then, Dave, if there's no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse.
so, who's molesting you?
teacher, extra friendly neighbor?
I'd ask if either one of you were involved, but you'd deny it.
we would never do anything to hurt Dan.
I say it here, it comes out there.
this lack of response is consistent with abuse.
there's no one, ok? I swear.
there was trauma; I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.
did you know that he got hit in the head?
they didn't mention it, no.
Yeah, why bother.
no, no, we took him to the ER after the game.
he was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine.
no concussion, it's gotta be something else.
you hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis.
cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion.
I had double vision before I got hit.
well, that changes everything, you need glasses.
that's why you had double vision, which is why you got hit, which is why you have a concussion, which is why you have night terrors.
you need to see an ophthalmologist, which I am not.
you enjoyed that.
I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.
you're an only child, aren't you?
why would you say that?
everything is about you.
this may seem incredibly controversial, but I think sexual abuse is bad.
I just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy, or mommy, anything else is just a bonus.
I'm not an only child.
interesting.
what?
don't move.
did I bore you in there?
what? Ah, no, not, not really. - Are you tired?
sometimes.
he never sleeps! Of course he's tired.
right now, at this moment, are you tired? - No, no.
that twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
didn't hurt.
his leg twitched. I don't see what
it's called a myoclonic jerk; it's very common when you're falling asleep.
respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up.
so?
so, he's not asleep, he's awake.
admit him.
I recognize that loopy "G."
so, what does the jerk tell us?
nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body.
can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscles.
a movement disorder or degenerative brain disease.
either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair.
maybe not that bad, could be an infection.
you wish. No fever, no white count.
anyone thinks this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?
I took an accurate family history.
you didn't even take an accurate family.
his father's not his father.
why would you say that?
30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.
from what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.
that's what our mom's would like us to believe.
who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?
$50 bucks says I'm right.
I'll take your money.
hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy.
make it $100.
what about leucoencephalopathy? In a 16 year old.
it doesn't necessarily have to be that bad.
if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.
Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier.
the night terrors were anecdotal. He could have had a bad dream.
no, parents said he was conscious during the event and didn't remember anything afterwards.
that's a night terror.
parents said?
that's a good point.
before we condemn this kid, maybe we should entertain Dr. Chase's skepticism.
I want a detailed polysomnograph.
if he's having night terrors I want to see them.
I usually don't move during night terrors.
I'm not restraining you for them.
eeg revealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
what are you doing?
fixing it.
can I talk to my parents?
Oh, they know all about this.
I'd really like to see them.
please! I'd really like them here.
this is gonna hurt, Dan.
Oh, God!
that's a night terror.
we did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray.
all the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.
OK, but let's pretend there's something and go from there.
who sees something on this MRI?
no lesions, no white matter.
no structural abnormalities.
no space-occupying tumors.
he's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain.
the smallest thing is abnormal.
meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.
excellent, you see what he did there?
he took a small clue that there's a neurological problem and wasn't afraid to run with it.
there's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.
no, there's not, he is completely wrong.
then what clue are you talking about?
he knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess.
clever, but also pathetic.
so, what did you find?
take a close look at the corpus collosum.
it looks ok.
are we all looking at the same thing?
200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain.
it's subtle.
there's some bowing, there. An upward arch.
are you guessing?
Yes.
too bad, you're right.
he probably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.
Yeah, he probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position.
something is pushing on it.
if there's bowing it could be a tumor.
do you see a tumor on this MRI?
no, but I don't see any bowing, either.
there's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms.
today night terrors, tomorrow he's bleeding out of his eyes.
get him a radionucleotide cisternogram. I guarantee you'll see a blockage.
OK... all right easy...
now, I'm injecting a material that's tagged with a radioactive isotope.
it's gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain.
it'll make you able to think deep thoughts, at about 100 miles per hour.
easy.
their eyes aren't the same color, but that fleck in the eyes...
that's maybe a one in ten chance if they're not related?
Nah, House isn't gonna pay you based on that.
[Chuckles] Any excuse we can give the folks to justify a DNA test?
we could tell them he's got Huntington's.
the whole family should be tested or they'll all die.
Hey, there's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.
they're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.
no more pressure, everything goes back to normal.
he's lucky to have you as his doctors.
no formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.
yummy.
her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.
Mmmmm. No fever, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates.
we're not vaccinating.
think they don't work?
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work.
pad their bottom line.
Mmmm. May I?
sure.
all natural no dies. That's a good business: all-natural children's toys.
those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs.
they don't lie about how much they spend in research and development.
the worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.
you know another really good business?
teeny tiny baby coffins.
you can get them in frog green or fire engine red.
really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you.
they think that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive.
want to change things? Prove them wrong.
a few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die than cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, believe me, prices will drop REALLY fast.
tell me what she has.
a cold.
there's a problem.
complications in surgery?
surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.
Really?
turns out the bowing wasn't the cause of his problems, it was a symptom.
Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG, which means multiple sclerosis.
and the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
because we're having a disagreement about whether or not it is MS.
no lesions on the MRI.
it's early; he's had the disease for maybe two weeks.
mcdonald criteria require six months to make a definitive diagnosis.
Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens.
McDonald.
Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.
the VEP indicates slowing of the brain.
without the lesions we can't be sure.
well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indicate rapidly progressive MS.
not the fun MS with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs.
we should wait until we...
start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5.
break it to the family. I'm going home.
it'll take months for a definitive diagnosis.
what'll happen to me?
ms is an incredibly variable disease, if it is MS, and we're not 100% sure.
what do you think is gonna happen?
there are some medications to manage the symptoms, but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe:
bowel and bladder dysfunction, loss of cognitive function, pain.
it's gonna hurt?
the brain's like a big jumble of wires.
ms strips them of the insulation, and the nerves die.
the brain interprets it as pain, but by starting treatment we're gonna avoid that for as long as possible.
we're looking into a couple specialists, and until we get you squared away you'll stay here.
security checked the videotapes for all the perimeter cameras;
he's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?
main floor.
OK, you take the cafeteria and administration.
I'll hit the research annex and work my way back to you.
I'm not here. Leave a message.
Dr. Cuddy, great outfit.
what are you doing back here? Patient?
no, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home.
Dr. House, Dan's missing.
Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately.
he shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.
I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache.
that would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning.
we wanted to keep you informed.
he heard some pretty heavy news.
this is not a toddler wandering around a department store.
he's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.
so, when you say "Call me if you need anything," You mean, "Don't call me."
no, I mean "Call me if I can do something."
I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing.
what about his parents? Should we call them?
Why? You think they're hiding him?
make sure someone checks the roof.
some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dan? Are you ok?
there are experimental treatments, ongoing research...
who knows what they'll discover in a year or two?
this is where I dropped the ball.
Dan, we're standing on the roof of the hospital!
Dan! Dan, you're not on the field!
he doesn't know where he is.
Dr. Foreman.
I assume you found the kid.
he almost walked off the roof.
suicidal?
no, he thought he was on his lacrosse field.
look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change...
conscious?
Yeah.
how'd you talk him down?
actually, Chase tackled him.
how come you didn't do it?
right, well, I am black, but he was closer.
come on, you can ride up with me.
anybody tells the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
they're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.
why does everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?
this is great news! He doesn't have MS.
the parents should be thrilled, well, the mom anyway.
of course, the dad probably doesn't know
why doesn't he have MS?
he was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this?
Yeah, sure.
he was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS.
the Oligoclonal bands.
were real. They just mean something other than MS.
so, what are they telling us?
that the immune system is working.
right, he has an infection in his brain.
what about sex?
well, it might get complicated.
we work together.
I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.
Hey, nice cover.
sorry, RPR was negative.
we don't need a definitive test to confirm this.
sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.
OK, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush.
so the fact that he doesn't have MS is, really not good news after all?
well, it is if it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%.
I'll start him on IV penicillin.
we're not going to wait for that.
the most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
we can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him.
no neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.
show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?
and who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
who thinks there's a third option?
very good, what's the third choice?
no idea, you just asked if I thought there was one.
[Sighs] The patient has a shunt in his brain.
there'll be no increased pressure; we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.
excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture.
one of us is going to do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks.
he could get syphilis even if he's not sexually active?
well, it's unusual, but it's possible.
relax.
Geesh.
it's infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure.
I wouldn't do that.
although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail.
steak knife?
wife's nail file.
nail File.
Yeah, the pain'll make you do stupid things.
something to take the edge off?
Yeah.
Cheers.
so, do you have family here in Princeton?
no.
here on work?
no, why are you...
does your penis hurt?
no. What? Should it?
no, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question.
your lawyer's gonna love it.
why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.
you're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?
Yeah.
now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose?
it's the free flowing puss that's the tip off.
I was in town.
not for family, not for work.
you drove 70 miles to a walk-in-clinic. You passed two hospitals on the road.
now, either you have a problem with those hospitals, or they have a problem with you.
my guess is that you've sued half the doctors in Maplewood, and the rest are now refusing to treat you.
it's ironic, isn't it?
it's like the boy who sued wolf.
you know what? I bet we have a doctor here named Wolfe.
how perfect would that be?
I'm gonna page him.
OK, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.
we'll drain your knee, run some lab work, and fix you right up.
why would you do that?
I'm a people person.
you actually treated him?
all I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them.
the cutest little tennis outfit, my God I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
Oh my God, I didn't see you there. That is so embarrassing.
how's your hooker doing?
Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that.
I heard you found her on the roof.
you have very acute hearing.
you notify the parents?
in due course, of course.
and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?
doesn't sound like me?
well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.
you think?
I saw the parents in the lobby. Smart money is obviously on the father.
my guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.
and if I win, no clinic hours for a week.
my guy will call your guy.
she's very good at her job.
the treatments should start helping soon.
let us know if it gets easier to focus on things, remember stuff.
hey Dan, isn't Dr. Cameron's necklace a beauty?
something South American, I think.
Yeah, Guatemalan.
it's a cool necklace.
thank you so much.
the kid's in pain.
don't fight it. - Just let it happen.
no.
no, what? - You'll be dead in three days.
I give it a day.
Dan? You ok?
he's hearing voices.
push three milligrams IV, stat!
come on Dan!
get OUT OF MY HEAD!
auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration.
penicillin's not working.
so, either it's a bad batch of penicillin, or our diagnosis is wrong.
square one. "Midnight."
LFTs, BUN, and creatinine, are all normal, diabetes is out. No gap.
there goes metabolic.
MRI rules out vasculitis.
"I" for inflammation.
too young for anything degenerative.
D," see ya. "N" for neoplastic?
MRI was clean.
"I" for inflammation.
we already did that.
stupid to have two I's in one mneumonic.
what's the other one?
infection.
Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
but no fevers; white count's elevated but within range.
and we've tested for anything remotely possible.
everything is negative.
ct scan rules out subdural.
trauma, later much.
you know the problem?
midnight is actually spelled with a "G" and an "H."
if we could just figure out what those two letters stand for.
it's a sick brain, having fun, torturing him, talking to him.
scaring the hell out of him.
get him an EEG, left and right EOG esophageal microphones.
if this thing wants to talk, let's listen.
we're missing something.
this is screwed up.
that's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?
I panicked, ok?
sounded cool though, they bought it.
Oh, crap.
another reason I don't like meeting patients.
if they don't know that you look like they can't yell at you.
here we go.
how can you just sit there?
if I eat standing up, I spill.
our son is dying, and you could care less?
we're going through hell; you're doing nothing?
I'm sorry, you need to vent, I understand.
don't be condescending.
you haven't checked in on him once.
blood pressure's 110/70, the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle, the EKG shows a normal QRS with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads.
LFTs are elevated but only twice the normal range.
Oh yeah, and he's hearing voices.
go hold his hand.
go on; I'll bus your tray.
got any sample bags on you?
I don't believe you. You're gonna run DNA tests?
their son is deathly ill, I know it's terrible, but the fact is if I don't keep busy with trivial things like this I'm afraid I might start to cry.
you're an ass.
yeah? You want to double the bet?
general Hospital is on channel 6.
Dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now, only mush.
no epileptiform activity.
what are you doing?
waiting for CBC and Chem-7.
good, run DNA on these.
what's this?
parents' coffee cups.
I can't believe you.
I've had this conversation once already.
if you've got something else to do, do it. Otherwise, do this.
Dr. House?
Hey, Mr. Funsten!
I was wondering when you'd be back.
got some papers for me?
you've caused me considerable mental distress.
I certainly hope so.
what? Too cheap to have your lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.
you have gonorrhea.
no, I don't!
well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do.
it could be a false positive; normally I'd run a second test, but since you're here I'll just go with the first.
you're just trying to scare me.
it's reportable you know, public health issue.
I'll be sure to let my wife know.
Oh, don't bother yourself. The state will call for you.
look, if you're clean I'm sure this will all blow over, no big deal.
there's an easy way to find out, get one of your doctors run a test.
these are mine now.
I'll see you in court.
west Nile negative, not surprising, since not too many mosquitoes passing through Jersey in December.
no Eastern Equine Encephalitis.
you guys aren't going to believe this.
what's that?
house was right; the father's not the father.
[Sighs] Dude doubled up on me.
you're not gonna believe this, the mother's not the mother either.
it's not a good idea to move your son in his condition.
we just want a second opinion.
we need an answer.
you idiots!
you lied to me!
we didn't lie about anything.
you, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son.
perfect.
can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs?
theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.
we're his parents.
he was adopted. He doesn't need to know.
I do.
adoption makes him just as much as...
listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused?
did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition, or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world?
how did you find out about this?
I sampled their DNA.
we didn't give you any DNA.
your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
you can't do that!
again, why are we getting hung up on what I did?
your medical history is useless.
no, we gave you a detailed history of his biological mother.
her history;
non-smoker, good health, low cholesterol, no blood pressure problems.
Dan was adopted two weeks after he was born. You have his history.
there's nothing you need to know that we didn't tell you.
sounds reasonable.
well, if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice, but I still think it's wrong.
was she vaccinated?
the biological mother, when she was a baby, did she get her vaccinations?
Dan was vaccinated at 6 months.
Mm hmm, and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months?
because before that, they are protected by their biological mother's immune system.
so, was she vaccinated?
an infant picks up a regular old measles virus.
he gets a rash, he's extremely uncomfortable, has a wicked fever, but he lives.
here's the kicker, once every million or so times, the virus mutates.
instead of Dan having a fever and a rash the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb.
in this case for 16 years.
sub-acute Sclerosing Pan-encephalitis.
I know. There're only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one.
once SSPE moves to stage two
boom, stage two is universally fatal.
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.
he's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight.
can we treat it?
ask the neurologist.
intraventricular interferon.
we're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.
we won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after everything we've given him.
why do people lie to me?
it could also kill him.
your ball, Foreman, tell me I don't have to biopsy his brain.
well, there is one other way.
you are sure this isn't gonna hurt?
Yeah, it's just scary as hell.
see, we go through the pupil.
you won't feel it; the eye's been paralyzed.
the needle travels to the back of the eye which is where we perform the biopsy on your retina.
so we've confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus.
the treatment for SSPE is intra-ventricular interferon.
we implant an Ommaya reservoir under the scalp, which is connected to a ventricular catheter that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere.
look, you want us to consent to this?
I don't even understand what you're talking about.
well, the antiviral.
look, I'm sorry,
I can explain this as best I can, but the notion that you're gonna fully understand your son's treatment and make an informed decision. It's kind of insane.
now, here's what you need to know, it's dangerous, it could kill him, you should do it.
you can't order a $3, 200 DNA test to win a bet.
it's not an actual cost.
I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine.
I'm serious.
well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance.
insurance is not going to pay for a bet.
it should. If we don't make that bet, the kid dies.
if not for the paternity bet, I never would have taken their DNA, without their DNA we never would have discovered that Dan was adopted, which was the key to this case.
you just don't want to pay your end.
big mistake. My guy knows a guy.
fine. I will let you out of clinic duty for one week, after you pay the $3, 200 for the PCR test.
woo.
well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson.
very bitter.
Hey, good morning.
good news on your EEG, treatment is working.
and your immune system is responding.
I know it's early, but let me take a look.
let's see what that brain of yours can do.
name as many animals as you can that start with the letter "O."
ostrich, ox, old elephant.
well, that's too better than last time.
how do you do with the whole adoption thing?
I knew since 5th grade.
how's that?
cleft chin.
I have one, my dad doesn't.
I looked it up on the Internet; it's one of those trait things.
that's right, it's autosomal dominant.
since neither of your parents have cleft chins, it's highly unlikely that you're biologically related.
you are sure you're ok?
I've got no problems with being adopted.
I love my parents.
how's he doing?
he's doing pretty well.
he's a smart kid.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Thanks.
wheels, one-eight! Wheels!
can I get you guys anything to drink?
scotch, neat.
jinx.
Oh, my... God.
kids, you may be wondering why five adults in their 30s would take a jinx so seriously.
it all started one day five years ago.
Ooh, Van Helsing.
jinx. You're jinxed.
that means that you can't speak until someone who was present for the jinx says your name, or else you will have very bad luck.
that's ridiculous.
you broke the jinx.
Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man. I'm on my building's co-op board.
when I say a Pinot Noir tastes luxuriously earthy with a hint of rhubarb,
I'm not faking it.
I've had several of the same sexual partners as Henry Kissinger.
I'm not about to stop talking just because I was jinxed.
later
Barney broke three limbs and two vertebrae, but he never broke another jinx.
in fact, he started taking jinxes way too seriously.
Barney, I'm on hold with Sports Talk AM to talk to my childhood hero from the Minnesota Twins.
who's your childhood hero?
Frank Viola. - Frank Viola-- jinx!
Hello, this is Frank. Anyone there? Hello?
I can hear you breathing, you coward.
so, when someone finally jinxed Barney for the first time in years, we were pretty psyched.
the reign of terror is over!
I've had this cigar in my pocket for two years, waiting for this moment.
Aw, that would've been good about two years ago.
Cheers.
Oh, oh, oh, you want us to say your name and un-jinx you?
I don't think so, pal. This is gonna be a long jinx.
like Yom Kippur services long.
the only difference is,
yom Kippur's a fast and this one's gonna be a slow.
now, Ted, I was wondering if you could expand upon what you were saying earlier about antiquated currency.
Ah, yes, yes. Contrary to popular belief, the buffalo nickel was modeled on the Black Diamond bison rather than the more iconic Western Plains bison.
in the winter of 2012 the skyscraper that I designed was about to open, which got me thinking about the most influential architecture professor I ever had.
so when the children of our grandchildren's children ask us "Who were we,
they'll find the answer carved into the granite poetry of our architecture.
okay. It doesn't get any better than that.
class dismissed.
wow, just wow.
do you need something? I have an apple I was hoping to eat in silence.
of course, Professor Vinick, I,um, I-I sketched out a design, and it'd be such an honor if you took a look at it.
Oh, well.
it is believed that it took the pharaohs over 100 years to build the Sphinx.
so... you think... I should spend more time on it?
Oh, dear God, no. This is terrible.
then, why'd you mention the Sphinx?
I find my mind is often with the Sphinx.
anyway, you'll never be an architect.
you'll never be an architect. You'll never be an architect. You'll never be an architect!
well, guess what.
I sent Professor Vinick the invitation to the opening of my building, so he'll see that I did become an architect, and that I've moved past his petty, hurtful words.
Wow. 15 years later and you're still this obsessed.
Yeah, if Vinick ever goes missing, the cops are gonna come looking for him in your basement.
totally, he's Ted's pit guy.
how dare you? And what is that?
a pit guy is someone you've been obsessed with for so long...
that it's driven you crazy enough to throw them in a pit in your basement like in The Silence of the Lambs.
I'm not gonna Silence of the Lambs him.
at most, I'd Revenge of the Nerds him.
though I don't see a scenario where he agrees to play me in a pentathlon.
Yeah, I'm with Ted-- there is no one I hate enough to throw into a pit.
what?
when Robin's most hated coworker Patrice started dating Barney, she became obsessed.
Patrice, Patrice goes in your pit.
guys, I told you, I am done obsessing about Patrice. Just drop her.
drop her in a pit. - Enough.
we all have people that we would throw in our pits, and I'm sure we all have people who would like to throw us in their pits.
Yeah, if Marshall or I ever go missing,
I'll tell you whose basement to look in.
Oh, no. It's creepy Daryl. Let's get out of here before he sees us.
Hey, hot sack coming through.
Hi, Daryl. - Hey, Daryl.
Hey! I feel like I never see you guys anymore.
like whenever I'm getting to a party, you're just leaving.
even that party at your place
you guys just raced off into the night at 7: 30.
that's weird.
but this is great-- the three hackmigos back together again.
we played Hacky Sack together once freshman year, Daryl. Once.
november 14, 1996. That is the best memory ever.
sure.
the three hackmigos for life.
to this day, we are still getting e-mails and posts from Daryl.
he has commented on every photo of Baby Marvin we have ever posted, and then he comments on his own comments.
look
Hey, guys, look, it's Bar...
none, my favorite non-speaking jinxed person in the world.
how was your day?
I'll spent so but I couldn't now say - Yeah, I didn't get a word of that. - Sorry, buddy.
Ah, Scherbatsky, it's my favorite time of year.
didn't know you liked Christmas so much.
no, year-end reviews.
we get to fire some people. Get into the spirit.
look, Sandy, you might enjoy firing people for petty personal differences.
I'd hardly call giving me gonorrhea a petty personal difference.
but I am a professional, and I would never fire someone for unprofessional reasons.
well, somebody's got to go.
kids, the thing about pit people, sometimes you don't even know you have one until you have a chance to push 'em in.
not happening, bro.
not happening, bro.
hand gets tired?
not happening, bro.
I hold in my hand the RSVP from Professor Vinick.
Ah, he's checked "Will not attend," which is fine, because all I needed to know was that he knows.
so now I will throw this in the trash and never look at it.
what's this?
I believe you've sent this to the wrong person.
I have no idea who Ted Mosby is.
Oh, you'll remember who I am, Professor Vinick.
you'll never forget it.
not happening, bro.
Ted, just because we're coming with you to Wesleyan does not mean that we condone your behavior.
just using it as an excuse to see the old campus...
and maybe watch you have a complete mental breakdown.
what are you even gonna do when you see Professor Vinick?
Oh, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
sweet merciful Franks Gehry and Lloyd Wright, from what brilliant mind was this work of art sired?
architect.
but that's-that's... - Impossible?
looks like you were wrong, Vinick.
dead wrong.
No!
be careful, Ted.
revenge fantasies never work out the way you want.
especially dance - based revenge.
my prom was rough, guys.
Ooh! We're almost there. Oh, I can't wait to see the old campus.
I'm gonna grab one of those giant dining hall hot dogs.
Oh, I love those huge wieners.
I'm not so sure you heard me.
I said, "I love those huge wieners.
I love them. In my mouth.
so, let me ask you a few questions, Clarice... Patrice.
how would you rate your performance in the last six months?
well, I don't like to talk about myself, but all my coworkers deserve an A-double-plus, that's for suresies.
Ooh, fancy lotion.
it puts the lotion in the basket.
it's just, this is really nice lotion.
and what a pretty basket, Robin.
I know, that's why I bought it, Patrice!
man, it's like nothing has changed.
Mmm, I know. The bun, the relish.
that's a knee. It's a beautifully drawn knee, so?
that's a barn.
Oh, knee barn, right. That's a great idea, Lily.
on the way home, we should stop at the knee barn, pick us up some wholesale knees. Yeah.
Marshall? Lily! You...
you're here.
Hi, Daryl. - Hi, Daryl.
Hi. Wow, after all these years.
you look just like you do in my paintings.
come here, guys.
there are men and there are gods.
antoni Gaudí was both.
there are jerk faces and there are buttholes.
professor Vinick was both.
good one, Ted.
come on, Vinick, give me an opening.
Gaudí's architecture gave expression to the anarchic geometric form of nature.
Gaudí's architecture...
actually, that's a really good point.
wow, Professor Vinick. Man, you taught me so much. About architecture and life. God, your lectures are so cool. I'll earn your respect and we'll be best friends.
okay, it doesn't get any better than that.
no, it doesn't.
what are you doing here, Daryl?
well, I live right down the street. But I work right here.
Oh, boy.
the - Are those... - ...our, our faces up there, buddy?
hack, yeah!
it was just as much your idea as mine to open up a Hacky Sack store here at Wesleyan.
so you never left?
once. I met a girl on Craigslist, and I flew to Boston to meet her.
she was a man, 300 pounds, and robbed me.
still, the best night of my life. Until now!
the three hackmigos back together again!
you know, I've been waiting forever to give you something.
you're coming with me to my house, and I'm not taking no for an answer.
dude, this is your chance.
set me free, and I will lie you out of this creepy nightmare.
this is a tough one.
on the one hand, we might die.
on the other, you're jinxed.
let me free, Marshall. This guy could be violent.
violent... Viola... Frank Viola.
we would love to come to your house, Daryl!
Yeah!
okay, um... how often are you and Barney doing it?
that's a strange question, Robin. - You're right.
maybe I should leave. - Yeah, maybe you should.
you're fired.
Wow. Just wow.
Ted Mosby. I'm a former student of yours.
you know, I actually became an architect.
any chance you remember me?
Oh, please excuse me, I've been teaching for over 20 years.
all the faces start to blend together unless you have a, a weird mustache or, or something.
junior year I tried to grow muttonchops, but people kept saying my face made them nauseous.
well, not people. You.
Anay, I would be honored if you, if you took a look at my building.
this... is hideous.
you'll never be an architect.
you'll never be an architect. You'll never be an architect. You'll never be an architect! You'll never be an architect.
wait. I was mistaken.
you most definitely will be an architect.
Really?
these are astonishing, Handlebar Pete.
so, when you said "surprise in your house,"
what you really meant was "surprise in the poorly lit windowless basement of your house."
Oh, you guys are gonna love what I have to show you.
I am so excited, I could just cry and laugh and scream and just punch the wall over and over and over and over and over!
could we just see it, like, up in the living room or anywhere less... gimp-storage?
I just realized I want to take a picture of this.
I want to put your faces on my mantel like a trophy.
like a trophy!
here I come.
and I've got your surprise right here!
No! We don't want your surprise, Daryl!
we're not your amigos, we're definitely not your hackmigos.
and before you murder us, you should know that we have a child!
he probably has eight or nine!
what? Murder?
I wanted to give you a check.
for $100, 000...
for coming up with the idea of the Three Hackmigos with me.
I brought you down here to show you all my inventory.
business has really exploded.
I mean, I'm sort of the Mark Zuckerberg of jam-band concert parking lot athletics.
well, second.
but I'm coming for you, Devil Stick Ron.
why would you fire me?
because nobody should be as happy as you are.
and also your cookies...
they're only pretty good.
Robin, is this really about me?
no, it's not.
the old "fire and bang ."
respect, Scherbatsky.
pretty good, right? Right, Handlebar Pete?
Ah, you got it easy with that sweet, sweet 'stache.
Hey, Ted, I see you're holding a little version of your building and yelling at strangers.
so I assume it all worked out?
I realized, since I work in a three-dimensional medium, the only way to really stick it to Vinick would be with a three-dimensional model.
whatever you do, don't march in there thinking, "I'm gonna do the worm. That'll show 'em"!
seriously, guys, I can't stress enough how bad my prom was.
speaking of the past...
wow, we feel like idiots. We're sorry.
you know, honestly, it's fine.
look how great I'm doing. Look at what I've built.
I don't need the validation of some people from college to feel good about myself.
my life is amazing!
I own a timeshare in St. Barts with P-Funk!
the, the whole band? - Yeah.
do you guys jam? - That's all we do.
so, you completely rejected the guy who's been obsessing about you for 16 years, and he was okay with it?
is creepy Daryl more emotionally adjusted than I am?
kids, sometimes in life you'll make a pit for someone in your mind.
but ultimately the only person in that pit is yourself.
I'm sorry.
just seeing you with Barney has brought up some old feelings, and I...
I really don't like feelings.
but that's not your fault or Barney's fault.
it's just really hard seeing you with him.
there's been a book on the side of the bed...
which means there's only one person who can let you out of the pit.
many years from now I know you'll hear me somehow...
so you fired Patrice? - No, she's staying.
the places we will go...
let's get out of here, guys.
Oh, Mr. Mosby. You built a model of your building.
no. - Why? To prove some sort of point?
this is just sad.
no, no, I was just throwing it out.
sure, you were. - No!
no, I-I-I had a transcendent moment where I found emotional clarity!
and I realize shouting that makes it seem like it's not true, but I did!
Yeah, we're gonna grab some snacks. You guys want anything?
spicy beef jerky. Got you loud and clear.
Oh, my God! Barney!
you unjinxed me! I'm free!
if the bison on the nickel could hear you talk about them, they would diminish their population even further on purpose.
if Lily wants a big wiener in her mouth, she's got my number.
and I'm sorry that you took the rap for all the farting on the car ride up here.
that was me!
the ring! What's, what's, what's the ring?
right, the ring. I'm gonna ask Patrice to marry me.
are you serious?
Jinx! Good!
I need to say some things without you interrupting.
Yes, I am serious.
I know that if you could talk, you'd say that I'm crazy or that I'm overcorrecting or that I'm moving too fast.
but you would be wrong.
look, I have banged my way through every bimbo in the tristate area, and it left me feeling nothing but, but broken.
but now, with Patrice, for the first time in my life,
I feel settled and happy.
I want to feel this way forever.
so tomorrow night on the roof of the World Wide News building
that's Patrice's favorite spot
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
Ah, poot-tu-tat! You're jinxed.
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules:
one: you can't try to talk me out of it, and two: you can't tell anybody. Agreed?
it's a jinx swear, so if you break it,
I get to hit you in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat.
thank you... Ted.
Hi, guys! - No. But you're jinxed!
I tricked Ted into saying my name.
Aw, come on, Ted!
Jinx! Jinx! Ha-ha! The reign of terror is back!
Hey, if you guys don't want me to smoke or fart in here, just speak up.
nothing? Great. Thanks for the spicy beef jerky, dude.
anyway, I think we could all use a little quiet.
unless you have something you want to talk about, Ted?
no.
not happening, bro.
so I had promised not to tell anyone about Barney's plan to propose to Patrice.
but I knew deep down Robin deserved to know.
uh, there he is!
the youngest architect ever to build a skyscraper in New York City!
the shockingly still single Ted Mosby. You hear that, ladies?
I can't believe the GNB Tower opens tonight.
Ted, your building finally gets unveiled to the whole world.
you hear that, ladies?! - Nervous?
everything comes out of my body in liquid form now.
ignore that, ladies.
Plus, I,I keep having this nightmare where King Kong shows up to the opening but refuses to climb my building because, in his words, "It's a bit derivative."
Oh, stop it, tonight is gonna be amazing.
and we are definitely gonna be there to toast you, but we might have to leave a little early if that's okay.
my dad just gave us the most amazing Christmas gift ever.
our first night away since Marvin was born.
24 hours straight without that little bastard.
Aw. This will be a nice memory to share with Marvin when he's older and deciding whether or not to put you in a home.
Hey, we need this.
we're maximizing our time away by planning everything down to the minute.
see? 2: 12 p. m.
- guilt Ted into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.
it's okay if you leave early tonight.
look, I just appreciate you showing up at all on your big night away.
I mean, Barney's not even gonna be there. - What?
this is the biggest night of your career.
why isn't Barney coming?
I don't know-- he said, "Legendary" and "Challenge accepted," and then he winked.
wait for it," you know, all that stuff.
that does sound like him.
well, we're your real friends and we wouldn't miss it for the world.
that is why we will see you tonight from 7: 03 to 7: 14.
Bye, guys. - Good night. - Bye.
okay, what's the real reason Barney's not coming?
here was my chance to tell Robin about Barney.
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't say what he was doing tonight.
anyway, uh, you know, I'm not taking anyone to the opening, so you want to be my date?
sure.
okay, Dad, I-I made you a list of Marvin's nightly schedule down to the minute.
okay.
Uh,"9: 06 p. m. -- put on edible underwear.
wrong list, wrong list.
come on, relax.
I know this little guy like the back of my hand.
dear Lord, what is that?
Oh, jam, okay. Just jam.
Oh, I-I forgot the lullaby.
do you know Marvin's lullaby? We sing it to him every night.
night, night, little Marvin. Stars twinkle for you. The Dreamland train's a-chuggin'.
all your dreams will come true. And the horsie says, "Good night";
and the birdie says, "Good night";
and the elephant says, "Good night";
and the skeleton playing his own rib cage Says, "Good Night";
and the robot says, "Good night."
good night.
enough with the damn music!
and Mr. Nesbit says, "Good night";
and the whole world says, "Good night."
take it, Mommy.
got it-- load him up with cough syrup, watch Breaking Bad until he conks out.
just kidding.
we did it. - Yeah, we did.
now that we're out the door, I actually don't feel anxious.
whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad! Oh, something horrible happened-- aah!
Oh, it's Ted, relax.
bar, now.
what is it? - He needs me.
but, baby, what about our magical romantic night?
in four minutes we're supposed to be doing hand stuff in the cab.
I'll be quick-- I'm sure it's nothing huge.
that's huge.
Yeah, that's why Barney's not coming tonight. He's getting engaged.
and I knew that I had to tell Robin. - But?
I may have, uh... asked her to be my date instead.
what is wrong with me?
deep down, is there still some crazy part of me that thinks I'm gonna wind up with Robin?
am I that deluded?
if so, I need to grow up.
Oh, um, by the way, I'm breaking a jinx swear here, so don't tell Barney or he gets to whack me in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat.
sure, pretty standard.
Robin deserves the chance to go after Barney one last time if that's what she wants.
Thanks, buddy. This helped. I'm gonna go tell her.
one quick thing. - Yeah.
don't.
Wow. Nice.
you know, now that I'm here, I don't feel that anxious.
it's my dad-- something horrible's happened!
my husband, relax.
Hey, um, I'm gonna be a little while, baby.
it's a long story, but Ted needs my help.
okay, but hurry or I'm gonna start doing number 11 on my own.
you can do that by yourself?
Pilates, bitch.
okay, why shouldn't I tell Robin?
because deep down some crazy part of you still thinks you're gonna wind up with her, and I agree.
Marshall... - I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.
always have been, always will be.
now, listen. I want my best friend to be happy.
and if Robin could mean happiness for you, then, dear God, why help her go after another man?
because she might still be in love with him.
to not tell her, to not give her that chance, it's... it's selfish.
so be selfish. - I can't do that.
tell that to the onion rings we just "split.
Robin is my friend.
she's always been more than that and you know it.
now, as we speak, my wife is in a hotel room cheating on me... with herself.
but I'm not leaving here until you promise not to say a word about this to Robin.
now repeat after me. "I...
well, I can do more at a time than "I."
I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop "putting everyone else's interests ahead of my own, and for once in my life, do what's best for me.
I...
sorry, what was the rest of that?
Hey, Dad, just taking a break from our amazing night to check in.
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated that I'm not there, huh?
not at all-- I don't think he even noticed you're gone.
it's kind of like Mommy who?
Oh... oh, good.
but I should probably sing him his nighttime lullaby over the phone, just in case.
sang it already-- nailed it.
did you do the horsie? - Yep.
the birdie? - Yep.
elephant? - Yep.
moose. - No moose, trick question.
robot. - Affirmative.
look, I should go. Marvin's asleep in my arms.
Mmm, his head smells like love. Bye.
and so, kids, on that cold December night
I decided to take your Uncle Marshall's advice and be a little selfish.
hello... and hubba-hubba.
Aw, thanks. But tonight is about my main man Mosby.
Really? Why?
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit the huge thing that's happening tonight.
Barney's getting engaged.
Ranjit out.
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?
he asked me to keep it a secret, but I thought you deserved to know...
do you?
do you, Robin?
Ranjit, a little privacy, please?
sorry, not listening.
nice, uneven floor there, Ted.
Lily, are you drunk?
what? I... I'm on vacation.
who invited the narc?
Hey, listen, I know that you miss Marvin, but it's not like we could've brought him to a black-tie event anyway.
I mean, a bow tie? Is it 1998 already?
Yeah, these parents are so lame and-and clingy.
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord already, right, guys?
great, I just started lactating. - Me, too.
so, what do you want to do?
Robin, I do not want to meddle,
Ranjit, let's just communicate via text from now on, okay?
I appreciate what you're doing.
because you're in love with him.
no, I'm not.
I'm happy for him.
so, it doesn't bother you that Barney Stinson's gonna propose to another woman on top of the World Wide News building?
I guess it's Patrice's favorite spot in the city.
damn it, Patrice, that's my favorite spot in the city!
Ranjit says, "Whoa.
okay...
maybe that one detail stings a little bit, but that doesn't mean I'm in love with Barney.
sounds like she's in love with Barney.
yes." With a little winky face.
look, I... I hope it goes well for Barney. I really do.
celebrating with you.
are you sure?
Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's kick-ass building.
I cannot hear you.
we will be there in five minutes.
it just means that you're horny and you're easy.
now, come on, let me smell his head.
Li-Lily, Lily, no, no, no, no, come on.
seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?
Lily. - What?
is it harder than we thought to be away from Marvin? Yes.
but are we gonna have fun or are we gonna wallow in the corner like idiots?
night, night, little Marvin. Stars twinkle for you. The Dreamland train's a-chuggin'.
all your dreams Will come true.
do you realize that something you thought up in your head now exists as a part of the Manhattan skyline?
that's huge.
it's just a building.
I mean, I'm incredibly young for such an achievement, but it's just a building.
I mean, Architecture Vision Weekly may have dubbed it "more than just a building,"
but it's just a building.
so let's not get carried... Okay, you're right, it's huge.
it is huge. You're the star of the party, and who knows?
maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby is gonna be there.
Yeah, maybe she will.
wait, this isn't your...
this is the World Wide News building.
go get him.
I told you, I am done chasing Barney.
now can we please go to your party?
Robin, do you want to spend tonight making small talk with a bunch of bankers in a daring yet refined contemporary masterpiece King Kong should feel lucky to climb...
...or do you want to follow your heart?
why do you keep insisting that I have feelings for Barney?
because you do.
see, even Ranjit agrees.
Oh, he's got to pee.
the point is, you're not over Barney.
that's why you freaked out about him proposing on the roof of the World Wide News building.
I did not freak out.
it's just... a teeny, tiny bit annoying that I am the one who showed her that roof in the first place!
damn it, Patrice!
never mind; I found a soda bottle.
okay, that's disturbing.
what do you want me to do, Ted?
run up to that roof, knock the ring out of Barney's hand, and say, "Sorry to interrupt, but you should be with me"?
is that what you want?
no. I don't.
I can't keep making an ass of myself.
well, a word in defense of making an ass of yourself, it's underrated.
eight years ago, I made an ass of myself chasing after you, and I've made an ass of myself chasing after you a bunch of times since then.
but I have no regrets.
because it led me to something that I wouldn't trade for the world.
it led to you being my friend.
so, as your friend and a leading expert in the field of making an ass of yourself,
I say to you from the heart, get the hell out of this car.
but, Ted, your big night.
it's just a building.
the Robin.
step one: admit to yourself that you still have feelings for this girl.
I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her.
more than she knows.
step two:
choose the completely wrong moment to make a drunken move after hanging out at a strip club and get shot down on purpose.
step three: agree that you two don't work, locking the door on any future you could have together.
I'm done trying to get you.
I can't do it anymore.
which will drive Robin nuts.
step four: Robin goes nuts.
step five: find the person who annoys Robin most in the world...
nobody asked for your help, Patrice!
...and ask for her help.
Oh, hi, Barney. What are you doing here?
actually, I'm looking for you.
this may sound kind of weird, but I have a proposition...
explain everything to Patrice and hope she agrees to help.
Yay. I love Robin. Of course I'll help.
good, good.
step six: check with your doctor about possible broken ribs.
step seven: pretend to be dating Patrice.
nobody asked you here, Patrice!
actually, I did.
step eight: wait until Robin inevitably breaks into your place to find the Playbook and show it to Patrice, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in your apartment.
Patrice, the robin's in the nest.
that means Robin broke into my apartment.
were you even listening when I explained the codes?
step nine: after Patrice finds the Playbook, have your first big fight.
this is going so well. Thank you so much.
I know, but what the heck are Lily and Ted doing here?
I don't know. My friends have no boundaries.
how can I ever thank you?
will you watch my cat next weekend?
no.
come on, we should probably go back inside.
step ten: prove your loyalty to Patrice by burning the Playbook, and actually burn it.
you don't need it anymore.
step 11: because your friends have no boundaries, they'll inevitably have an intervention for Robin, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in Marshall and Lily's apartment.
step 12: tell only Ted about your plan to propose to Patrice.
you can't tell anybody. Agreed?
step 13: wait and see if Ted tells Robin, and if he does...
Barney's getting engaged. ...
it means your best bro in the world has let go of Robin and has given you his blessing.
step 14:
Robin arrives at her favorite spot in the city and finds the secret final page of the Playbook.
the last play you'll ever run.
step 15:
Robin realizes she's standing underneath mistletoe.
seriously, Barney?
even you, even someone as certifiably insane as you must realize that this is too far.
you lied to me, manipulated me for weeks.
do you really think I could ever kiss you after that?
do you really think I could ever trust you after that?
this... this is proof of why we don't work, why we'll never work.
so thank you. You've set me free because...
how could I be with a man who thinks that this...
trick, this enormous lie could ever make me want to date him again?
turn it over.
step ...will you marry me?
Yes.
and so, let's all raise a glass to Ted Mosby.
none of this would have been possible without him.
to Ted. - To Ted.
sometimes, life is so perfect.
isn't it?
it has to be. To make up for all the hard stuff it throws your way.
you have to learn to walk.
you have to learn to talk.
you have to wear that totally ridiculous hat your grandma bought you.
you have no say in the matter.
and when you're a little older, even though you get to choose your hats, you don't get to choose what they put in those meatballs at the cafeteria.
or when to fall in love.
things happen, and you just have to deal.
and breathe.
let's just think of the day my parent's divorce came through as " Big, Ugly Hat Day. "
refer to diagram B on page 1 9.
" the Tree of Life. "
and breathe.
...Anybody but his own selfish pleasure.
mom, please. - Focus.
I couldn't care less about your father's midlife crisis and complete mockery of his wedding vows.
I just hope he doesn't expect me to take
Halley, l'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
guys-- -Where do you think you're going?
as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice, does it matter?
excuse me, everyone. I
mom? - Sorry.
I have some really important news to announce here.
Lewis and l-- we're getting married.
he asked me last Saturday night.
I wanted to tell you, but I wasn't sure when, or how you'd react.
I told him I couldn't even wear this ring until after I talked to you.
but we wanna have this big Spring wedding.
mom, l'm so happy.
nice timing, huh?
tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced.
why does love make people crazy?
Scarlett, you weren't picking up your phone. I'm so sorry.
Halley, that's Michael. Michael...
Hi.
thank you.
Bye! I love you!
what do you think?
you didn't tell me you were doing it.
when you meet the right person and you fall in love...
it's like...it's like everything you thought...
you thought is...
can you believe it?
no. I can't.
Scarlett, come on.
you are sounding dangerously close to a Hallmark greeting card.
you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
Yeah.
you can't expect to do anything great in life if you buckle the first time some guy bats his eyes at you.
news flash, Hal.
even Madonna eventually got married.
my mom thinks that means there's hope for her, too.
your mom wants to get married?
well, she wants to fall in love, Halley.
everyone does.
Hi. I've been in
Hi. I've been divorced for a long time, so my baggage is ancient history.
I like to think that I travel light these days.
except for my daughter, Scarlett, who is just a joy of a carryon.
I think l'm taking the baggage thing too far.
maybe I should start over.
you know what I think of this whole idea.
I'm only gonna send it to the online guys who pass my rigid five-point checklist.
here, you try.
go away. - Lydia.
the man of your dreams is sitting out there right now waiting to hear from you.
speak to him.
I don't think the perfect man is gonna want to hear what I have to say.
sure he does, Sweetie. Speak to him.
go on.
I'm sorry, Mr. Perfect...
but if you're waiting for me, it's gonna be a hell of a long wait.
see, l've had it with men like you.
I think it's terrific that you have a great job, and you're sensitive to the needs of others, and you jog three times a week to keep the belly at bay.
but the second some silicon-breasted, butt-kissing, airhead climber half your age comes along, you can't keep your pants zipped.
well, fuck you!
that's right, Mr. Middle-age, think-you're-a-big-shot, phony asshole.
you ain't getting any from me.
okay.
I think we'll just give this a little time.
so juvenile.
I'm glad you're back early from camp, even though it was a dishonorable discharge.
what happened? Where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
no comment.
no comment?
I don't speak to the press.
I'm the press?
Yeah, and anything I say can and will be used against me, right?
I would never use anything against you.
dad, give it up! It's old, and you need to get your own material.
daddy Dog. - Yo.
Len Martin. It's you, right? WDYG's coolest DJ.
that's me.
" we dig the dog! "
love your show, man. - Thanks, man.
you are the hippest old guy I know.
yo, dude! I'm not that old!
that's Len Martin.
Hello, gorgeous ones.
and you invited her.
Hey, Baby. - Hey.
I thought we'd spend time together, then we could have a chance to bond.
Well...Iook at you, Halley.
that's hard to do without a mirror, isn't it?
honey, you keep getting prettier every day.
I have no idea how you could say that, cause...
you definitely don't see me every day, do you?
and yesterday, oh, my God, I was so ugly, and last Wednesday-- that sucked, too.
so it's kind of a day to day thing.
I love that sense of humor.
just like her daddy.
look at that gorgeous girl. - Dad, stop it.
she's got her daddy's hair.
don't cut it. - lt's beautiful.
don't cut it. Just let it grow, let it grow.
don't cut it.
cut it.
okay.
let me count the ways that this card can be used to induce nausea, gastric distress, vomiting.
Yeah, go ahead and mock me, but this is serious.
I need to find something funny and something sweet
just the way Scarlett is.
remember last time I got her-- - Okay. Look, here's one.
not helping.
" from small beginnings come great things. "
" congratulations on your new baby. "
I thought you were gonna help.
lighten up, Sherwood.
" the first time we met, you stole my heart. "
" good luck in finding a compatible organ donor." Nice.
I'm kidding, okay? It's blank inside.
you know something? You're not too funny.
this girl is amazing-- unlike you
and she's sensitive-- unlike you.
and she's sexy.
unlike you.
there's gotta be a card... - Is that Michael?
...for a redhead from... - I can't see.
...a newly smitten hunka hunka burning love.
I mean...Iook.
summer romance has its own section.
it's not a summer romance. I mean...
scarlett is... - Standing right behind you, dude.
Hi.
sneaking up on me?
Hi, Halley. - Hi.
you remember my name?
sure. We were in Biology together.
Yeah, I know, but...
well, you were never there, really...technically.
I like your hair.
thank you.
see, my schedule is all wrong, which I think is a sign that nothing's going according to plan this year.
it's a complete and total mess.
looks like a fine schedule to me.
no. Band? I would never sign up for band.
what's wrong with band? - I don't play anything.
well, maybe you should. I'm sure you can handle it.
Mrs. Toussaint, this is not my schedule.
look, l'm signed up for Algebra, and l've already taken Calculus.
maybe a brush-up is a good thing, not to mention a good grade.
why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
okay, l'm signed up for boys' P. E.
94 FM - Fill out this form.
daddy Dog. - We'll start again.
Len Martin with a traffic update from that love puppy in the skies, our very own Lorna Queen.
Lorna, you up there?
Hi, Len.
on a clear day, you can see forever, and this is one beautiful morning.
should we tell everyone our little secret?
careful. Baby, you sure this is the time?
I am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping.
I just spilled the beans.
that is your father's show, right?
I just love it.
Hi.
tell him congratulations.
I'm sure you're very excited about the upcoming nuptials.
my father and my sister.
my sister and my father?
your father and your sister are getting married?
Yeah.
no, not to each other.
I...
I have to check something before I fill this out.
sit down, Forrester.
let's see if we can sort out your usual chaos.
maybe you'll even do us the honor of attending this year.
okay, later, M. T. I gotta rethink that shop class.
I'm pretty scary with tools.
Oh, my.
you didn't know about your dad getting married?
Yes, I did.
the bastard tells the whole world before he tells you.
he's not...
whatever.
at least if they're eloping, you won't have to go the wedding.
weddings are the worst.
me? I've had to go to, like, fine between my parents.
don't ask.
listen, M. T. wasn't giving you a hard time back there, was she?
Mrs. Toussaint and l-- we're on close terms.
you get to know your guidance counselor really well when you're clearly in desperate need of guidance.
see, l've got it down to a science.
you try the Jedi mind trick.
what's that? - You never saw Star Wars?
no, I saw it. I guess I just didn't memorize it like you did.
well, that's your loss, isn't it?
because the Jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think, and they think it.
for example, M. T. says, " Macon, you're already in trouble, and it's the first day of school.
is this any way to start the new year? "
pretend you're me. Nowwhat do you say?
okay. I say...
no. I wanna be someone else.
cute. No. You as me say...
Mrs. T, you're gonna let this one slide because it was an honest mistake, it's only the first day of school, and the fire was put out as quickly as it was started.
you didn't really start a fire, did you?
the point is that you put the words into somebody's mouth and they give them back like they've come up with the idea.
like when I ask you to go out this Friday night, you're gonna think you're asking me because you're gonna say, " l would love to go out with you " because I know we'll have a great time together.
in fact, l've been hoping you'd ask me all week.
you wanna go out on a date with me?
see? I told you you'd ask me.
Macon, I think I like you too much already to actually go out with you.
what kind of logic is that?
it's logical logic.
the quickest way to ruin a relationship with someone is to actually try to have a relationship with them.
haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together, eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
I am, too--boycotting.
you can't boycott your father's wedding.
it's not even a wedding. It's...an elopement.
Yeah, except everyone within his radio frequency is invited.
my God. He is such a hypocrite.
I cannot believe he wouldn't tell us about it first.
he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
none. - She was at that dinner?
no.
okay, yeah. She was there at the end.
mom, come on. She wasn't even supposed to be there.
you know, I don't think l'm gonna let him walk me down the aisle.
please stop worrying about me. I am fine. I'm fine.
in a way, it sets me free. I feel strangely liberated.
and he is still your father, after all, and if he wants to make a complete and utter fool of himself by trying in some pathetically cliche' fashion to recapture his sorry state of manhood, by hooking up with not even a very attractive bimbo...
then if that's what he wants, l'm fine with that.
someone toss, please.
now.
this is our reception area.
with out post-ceremony champagne bar...
which is conveniently located right next to our very own chapel.
can't you picture walking down this aisle?
in a coffin.
sorry, it's just... a little depressing.
actually, nobody's ever said that before.
Lewis...say something. What do you think?
well, I like it. It's very clean.
clean?
is that what you want our wedding day to be? Clean?
it's not...it's not pretty, it's not intimate, it's not romantic.
I'm just so happy that I get to marry you.
I'm sorry, not to pressure you, but this space does book up quickly for Spring.
we have another couple
why don't we give them a moment to think.
Ashley, Sweetie, they plan the whole thing.
the food, the flowers... even the place cards.
think about how much less hassle it'll be.
you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
it hasn't even been that long.
19 1/2 hours.
wouldn't Michael look cool in that?
Hey, I did a good job.
michael Sherwood would look good in anything.
that's not the point, though, okay?
enjoy him, and fool around with him.
don't fall in love with him.
why do you think they call it " falling, " anyways?
it's not worth it to you to spend on a wedding.
it's the most important day.
I was trying to kill two birds with one stone.
cheap is what that is.
you see cheap, I see convenience.
look at them.
they're like a walking warning sign against romance.
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek who has my sister under some spell.
now all this formerly semi-intelligent person thinks about is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.
it's like K-Mart.
how am I supposed to knowwhat it looks like?
maybe go by and look at it? Or maybe
see? They don't even like each other.
but this stupid spell they're under makes them disregard all the facts.
they are fighting because they love each other enough to care.
I didn't know it looked like a K-Mart before I went there.
once we got in there, you knew. - I made a mistake.
too bad you can't get a divorce before getting married.
you could save yourself in that stupid extra step.
l'm sorry. - See?
what are you looking for? - These dishes, they're perfect.
that's love, Halley.
okay, fall once and you may never be able to get back up again.
geek! Get out of here.
isn't he adorable?
he's cute.
all right, Michael!
way to get that goal!
okay, guys, line up!
okay, back up. Let's give him some air.
Sherwood? You hear me?
guys, back up. Give him some air, all right?
call the doctor.
I thought my parents' divorce was the end of the world.
that was before Michael died of a heart defect.
and the world stopped.
or it should have.
I'm sorry.
what do you think?
I think it's 1 00 degrees out.
what am I supposed to do?
the only black clothes I have are winter clothes.
I have nothing nice to wear.
I don't think it matters, really.
look, this is...this is dark green and it's really nice.
it's ugly, Halley.
I'm just trying to think about something else.
anything, for one single second.
I wanna look good for him.
does that sound crazy?
this was a bad idea.
Yeah, but dying is definitely not one of the better concepts.
no, the dress. Everyone's looking at me like l'm a freak.
okay, it's not for them. It's for Michael.
remember that.
can you believe what she's wearing?
that's, like, so disrespectful.
she always has to have all the attention to herself.
although it droop and die that night, it was the plant and flower of light.
in small proportions, we just beauty see.
and in short measures,
Iife may perfect be.
Mr. Macon Forrester will now address us.
I was gonna read from this...
but l'm not very good at reading.
or writing...
or spelling.
not like Michael.
he was good at so many things without even trying.
he taught me how to be myself.
by myself.
not to worry about what other people think.
even if that means being completely uncool.
he taught me about how to trust people.
and how to love.
cause he was so good.
he loved his family, he loved his friends.
he loved basketball.
and he loved Scarlett.
and he loved this.
take this woman, Lorna Queen, to be your lawful wedded wife, your partner, the queen of your heart, forever and ever?
Oh, yeah!
daddy, rock on with your woman!
and do you, Lorna P. Queen, take this old guy Len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
I do.
wrap it up. We're off in 15 seconds. Go.
our airtime is almost up.
we must now go where Federal regulations will not allow you to follow, if you know what I mean.
Lewis, no barking.
sorry, but you gotta go.
poor little thing.
I know just how it feels.
out with the old, in with the new.
and who do you think you are?
just because you've got great petals.
Oh, my God. I'm talking to my plants.
Oh, my God.
you're talking to your plants.
how was it?
it was great...
if you happen to be the Devil and enjoy human pain.
tell me something.
I don't know! What do you want me to tell you?
wait! No, the bimbo almost died of strangulation.
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.
her wedding veil took on a life of its own and rebelled, and she had to claw her way out.
and you know that woman can claw.
it was so sad. It was like near death by wedding veil.
just tragic, isn't it?
Oh, my God! And their vows?
was Dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
I'm sorry.
your father's not a loser.
although he did choose to look like one at our wedding, too.
he insisted on wearing a powder-blue tuxedo.
then why do people get married, anyways?
we know they're lying to each other, but are they lying to themselves, too?
how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
things do sometimes change, Halley.
this house is awfully big for just the two of us, don't you think?
what? - You'll be going to college soon.
Mom...a year and 3/4 is not really that soon.
I want to start thinking about streamlining.
maybe we should sell the house.
I grew up in this house.
Yes, and there have been some great memories in this house.
this is my house.
I understand how you must feel, but life changes.
this is ridiculous, Mom! Come on!
and I don't want to live here alone.
I have to give him a ride.
Bye, Halley.
stand back! Leaf man to the rescue.
where did you get that?
a guy's gotta pay for gas and bacon burgers somehow, right?
and toys, cause I imagine
star Wars figurines must get pretty expensive.
I do not have any Star Wars figurines.
not many, and I don't play with them...much.
this one's on the house.
okay.
here you go.
you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
no, but that's a good theory, I guess, if you want to protect your fragile male ego.
'cause you can't handle rejection.
rejection? Whatever!
of course you think it's weird that I didn't just use the phone, but you're also glad because it's much better to talk in person.
especially when l've come with such a specific purpose.
which is why you're gonna cut me some slack.
you are absolutely crazy.
I've been called worse.
you're gonna kiss me, Halley.
you're gonna come a little closer...
so I can put my arms around you.
and on the count of three...
you're a really good kisser.
you tricked me.
you Jedi mind-tricked me.
Halley, is that you out there?
close your eyes. Go to bed.
give me a break. - Who are you talking to?
I'm sorry, l...
sorry.
I just...I needed to talk.
I was just coming over for a little late-night chat.
we're not gonna stay up very late, okay?
at least do it inside.
" nausea " ?
a little.
" breast tenderness " ?
Yeah. Major.
" food cravings " ?
grapefruit.
come on, I could answer " yes " to most of these questions, too.
I used to hate grapefruit.
what's wrong?
no offense, Halley, but...
...your perfume is making me sick.
come on, l'm not wearing perfume. I use soap.
" heightened sense of smell."
okay, so do you prefer direct pee-on-a-strip or dip-in-a-cup?
maybe it's a false reading.
because I have heard of things such as false readings.
and the strips did not look completely pink, only kind of pinkish, so
five kits, Halley.
what am I gonna do?
so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride.
it wasn't a joy ride. - Maybe I should
don't think you're off the hook.
you don't even have your license, and you are a terrible driver.
I was helping Scarlett get some books at school--we left them
forget it, Halley!
mom...
taking your car out is gonna seem like the least of it...
because whatever you're thinking right now...
it's worse.
one of you better tell me before I have a nervous breakdown.
I'm pregnant.
well, thank God you told me in time.
shouldn't I be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
I'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding, but you are my sister.
lt's an emotional time. - All right. I was just joking.
just because you think up something you think is funny, doesn't mean you say it.
okay, Ashley, l'm sorry, all right?
it's just... I love the dress, really.
I feel like a princess. You know?
I look awful.
we'll fix it.
it's not the dress that needs fixing.
it's me.
Ashley, would you drive Halley home?
I have to get back to work.
give me my money back, you stupid, lying, feckless, two-timing son of a bitch!
can I help you, madam?
it stole my money, so, just...
here.
this works a little better sometimes.
what's your pleasure? - Diet Coke sounds good.
the last one.
on me.
I hope I didn't, you know, kick it too...
I think these machines are built to withstand a good booting every now and then.
steve Beckwith. - Lydia Martin.
did I say " Martin " ?
it's Lydia Williams now.
Lydia Williams again. - Williams, again?
nice to meet you.
thank you.
aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
you sound like Mom.
can one of you zip me, please?
you guys know you're wearing the same dress, right?
unbelievable.
you're grandmother's in there changing.
we practically are.
l'll change. - No, l'll change.
I can change. - No, I shouldn't wear black, anyway.
Halley, could you please wear something a little more feminine?
because the Warshers are really traditional. Thank you.
sweetheart, do you need the loo?
grandma, no. I'm gonna use the one downstairs.
don't be silly. Come on in.
okay. - l'm almost through.
it smells like...
just burning a little incense.
mother?
are you smoking the cannabis again?
I had a little headache.
but l'm feeling really much better now.
I knew we'd be late.
we're fine.
his parents are promptness nuts.
I can't believe l'm late.
that's what happens when you make people change ten times.
these leaves would make a wonderful textile.
Halley, look.
I'll bet if we make sheets of this pattern, we'd make a million dollars!
mother, please, not now.
she's high.
she's not high, she's medicated.
it's interesting-- when you make the " ow" sound, your mouth does this funny thing in the corner.
you're not sick anymore.
you were only allowed to use weed when you were sick.
could you ring the bell? - I do get headaches a lot.
smile.
does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
this is a total disaster.
shit!
hello.
now, I know it's turkey day, but we thought squab would be most special.
they're absolutely adorable.
squab. - Can I say l'm a vegetarian?
no.
it reminds me of a little yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.
such a sweet, smart little bird.
they look wonderful. - Thank you.
marcella's such a truly magnificent cook.
we are lucky to have found her.
I bet there's a story in that.
tell me, how lost were you before you were found?
because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often.
grandma.
she came with us 20 years ago, when we moved here from Atlanta.
she really raised our Lewis.
I didn't realize you were a working mother.
I wasn't.
she did go through a brokerage training program.
she was good. Killer instinct.
but she set her sights on me, instead.
I'd say I got the best deal at the firm.
he's all right.
he's no Clark Gable... but then very few men are.
what was the name of that character?
Ashley.
no, you're Ashley.
the wedding plans are coming along beautifully.
well, you holler if you need any help at all, understand?
I want this to be a memorable affair.
Carol does throw one heck of a luncheon.
that is my one regret about not having more children.
having girls must be such fun.
but we always felt that having an only child was a much better way to mold and shape character.
Ashley was alone for her first six years.
I like to think she got the best of both worlds.
my best friend is an only child.
she's having a baby, which at our age is something that obviously wasn't planned.
and her mom is not really thrilled about the whole situation, but I really think she's kind of starting to get behind it now, so...
which way to the bathroom?
down the hall and to your left.
isn't it a surprise--our children choosing to get married so young?
I always thought Lewis would take his time to find the right person.
well, it must be the example of you and Dad.
I mean... you make marriage seem so fun.
and Ashley's a lot like you, Mom.
she's a very determined woman.
open the door, Halley.
young lady?
open the door. Are you all right?
lovely evening. Thank you.
thanks for sticking up for me. - What are you talking about?
your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married.
you made it sound like l'm some desperate woman somehow forcing you into the whole thing.
I did not.
Ashley's a very determined woman.
I didn't say that.
I have witnesses! Mom, you were there.
you did say something along those lines.
well, that is not how I meant it.
Lewis, you have a lovely family and that is what is important.
they weren't exactly lovely to you.
Oh, You actually work for a living, you lower class, pathetic divorce?
Ashley, enough.
I'm the one who got humped by a dog in there.
where are we? - You'll see when we get there.
lt's too dark to see. - Well, just hold on.
me and Sherwood found this place a couple years ago.
we used to come here.
you like it?
Yeah.
Yeah, come on. Let's dance.
no. - Yes.
come on, Macon.
no.
please? Come on, Macon.
no. - Please.
you look great, but I just...
Michael's parents moved to Florida.
you still have to tell them.
I know.
I just can't figure out what to say that makes any sense.
which makes sense, given that none of what's happened makes any sense.
you know, it's weird.
because if you were the one that was pregnant...
I would understand you considering having an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption.
you can still put the baby up for adoption.
no.
I know all the arguments.
and I know what l'm giving up.
and I know that nothing is gonna be normal for me anymore.
but what is normal, anyway?
growing up with my mom sure wasn't.
losing Michael wasn't.
I used to think that my family was the picture-perfect example of normal.
us.
maybe being abnormal is what's normal...right?
Yeah, like you and Macon.
it doesn't make sense you falling in love with a guy like him.
I'm not falling in love with him, I like kissing him.
we're just friends.
with benefits.
shut up.
Bye, l'm leaving. - You've got it bad.
I hope this isn't a bad time.
I know this is awfully forward of me, but...
I can't stop thinking about you.
you're out of uniform.
Oh, that. I forgot I was wearing that. Didn't I explain?
I'm a Civil War reenactor-- a little hobby.
I like thinking about a time when honor and chivalry really meant something.
I know l've been slow to take action.
Slow's good.
would dinner tonight be too fast?
Yes.
I mean, no. I mean, l'd love to.
Cheers.
friends?
friends.
Steve, I had a lovely time.
good night.
I was just-- - You were just leaving.
exactly.
this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
you said it-- my own home.
that implies I have a right to choose what I do.
Halley Marie Martin, conduct unbecoming.
No!
you never told me you were serious about this boy.
I'm not serious.
that's what you do with people you're not serious about?
you know what?
maybe if you had a little bit more fun, you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now.
where is all this attitude coming from?
this is not like you.
like me? You don't even know me.
maybe you're just not very good at knowing people.
how well do you know that strange boy?
mom, He's not strange, okay? His name is Macon.
and maybe if you paid attention to anyone
God forbid--besides yourself and Ashley and her stupid wedding, you would know that.
I'm trying.
Halley, you used to talk to me.
Yeah, and you were too busy hating Dad to listen.
I'm sorry you've had to go through this.
I hate Dad so much for doing this to us.
I hate him, I hate him.
and then I don't hate him, and I feel bad for hating him
sweetie, I don't want you to hate your father.
he's a decent man.
I don't want you to hate me either, but I am going to have to start laying down some rules around here.
here we go.
Halley, you're grounded until next year.
no.
you promised me that I could go to the New Year's Eve party with Macon--Mom, please!
no. No buts, no New Year's Eve, no Macon.
God!
dear Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood...
guess what? You're gonna be grandparents
exclamation point.
why don't you try telling Michael's parents what you really feel?
Macon Land.
happy New Year.
happy New Year.
Hey, Macon, the man.
Hi.
the party's just arrived. - The party has--l'm here.
Yeah. - Okay. Hold still.
sorry.
now, you are pretty.
come on, you can smile better than that.
what? She doesn't know how to smile?
maybe she doesn't want to.
well, excuse me for breathing.
Yeah, you're breathing too close.
sorry about this. - lt's okay.
happy New Year. - Happy New Year.
here's to the new year, right?
Yeah, right. To the--to the new year.
okay, knock-knock. Police raid.
Hey, Macon, my man...what's up?
what's up with you?
I lost my damn earring.
Hey, Macon.
Hi, Halley.
Hi.
Thanks.
nice name.
who wants to see my ferret?
dude, I have one. Come on, dude.
I put a little hat on him and everything. It's awesome.
so, when's Scarlett due, anyway?
you know?
Yeah, my mom's a bookkeeper in her doctor's office, but...don't worry. I haven't told anyone.
third week of May.
God, that is so freaky.
you know, it's weird, but...
I didn't even know they had hooked up.
Really? They went out all summer.
did they?
Yeah, and he was completely in love with her.
she's ruining her life, you know.
I think l'd kill myself before I had a baby.
I know enough to know I wouldn't be able to handle it.
you're probably right, because you're not Scarlett.
right.
thank God for that.
what's wrong?
I'm sorry.
Halley, where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I really am.
what was that all about?
I thought you wanted us to be together.
I do--but, " together " ?
it's so official and so big for us.
maybe you should just say what you feel for once.
I could do that.
I can.
I can.
I felt like I had to get out of there because I might...
really...
care about you, and...
and it scared me so much because that meant that...
you could hurt me.
or maybe I just didn't feel ready.
to like someone...that much.
and I like you.
don't make it so complicated, Halley.
some people fall in love.
I had to crash into it.
Hey, Baby.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
you gave us quite a scare.
God.
and I ruined your party, too.
I'm not concerned with the party.
your date with Steve. I know that was so important to you.
Halley, I know you were with Macon Forrester.
mom, it was not his fault, though.
we were trying to leave this really bad party.
he was letting me drive-- you know l'm like the worst driver, and I could not even see
Halley, save your strength. You're gonna need it to come up with better excuses.
Macon wasn't there when I woke up.
Macon wasn't there when I left.
Macon wasn't there the whole next week at school.
what do you expect when you break your own rules?
any word from him?
no.
I guess that's what guys are good at, right?
disappearing?
Hey. I'm back.
you really don't get it, do you?
I'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up.
Oh, my...are you okay?
Hi, Halley.
I think I just dropped my keys.
no, they're in the door. Come on.
stop spinning! Stop spinning.
I'm not spinning!
quiet!
maybe you should be quiet.
that's what you should do.
upstairs.
Oh, Halley, you're such a good sister.
you think l'm doing those? I am not doing those.
be careful.
Christ, Halley. It's all right.
this is my bachelorette party.
I am a bachelorette.
thank you, little sister.
you are the greatest.
okay, Ashley, please just take this.
Jesus. What
you just...
please. Come on. Mom is upstairs sleeping.
mom's not home.
Really? And how would you know that?
friday night she sneaks out to have sex with Steve.
she told you that?
she didn't want you to know.
God, why do people think that I can't handle the truth?
go on, you hatchet-faced scarecrow!
you baboon!
you bag of bones! - You old weasel face!
sourpuss! - Sorry old flabby nincompoop!
top of the morning to you.
how is she?
sweetie.
a hangover kit.
not to appear superior, but I did limit myself to one glass of champagne, thank you very much.
if it wasn't for Halley, I would've died, probably.
no, you just would've woken up on the porch.
bet the neighbors would've loved that.
right, especially with the men's underwear around her neck.
underwear?
it was nothing. It was stupid.
underwear is not nothing.
no, they were pretty much nothing.
we promised each other no strippers.
I know, Lewis, I know, but I was at the mercy of my friends.
don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
of course they mean something, Lewis.
God, don't be so uptight!
Oh, l'm uptight? I'm not uptight!
Yes, Lewis, you are. You are uptight.
you know what else? Halley was right about you.
you have got a broomstick up your butt.
I never said that!
okay, well, guess who put it there?
don't talk to me that way. Maybe l'll find somebody fun!
to tell the truth, you're no fun!
we made a promise to each other, but you don't keep it because you're self-absorbed.
don't talk to me that way.
hello. Good morning, Halley.
what's going on? - I think they're breaking up.
relax. You're no fun.
marriage is a promise, and a promise has to be kept.
not every argument leads to a breakup.
for real!
the wedding is off.
l've been trying to say l'm sorry. - l'm sorry doesn't always cut it, Macon!
I couldn't stay with you at the hospital.
I know I should have, but think how much more freaked out your mom would've got if she'd have seen me.
Oh, my God.
okay. Wow, thank you so much.
so, you were ditching me for my own benefit.
no, that's not it.
I didn't ditch you.
I
okay, l...
I freaked out.
I'm not used to feeling this way about somebody.
and I just...
I couldn't believe I almost lost you, too.
here. Come on, l'll help you eat them.
no. I don't want any.
I can't see you anymore.
your mom will get over it.
it's not my mom. It's me.
and, of course, if you do decide to get married,
I can get my makeup and hair people to do you on the big day.
if you decide not to get married,
I think you should let them do some work on you anyway, because you are gonna want to look your best when you get back out there.
darling, there is nothing wrong with canceling a wedding.
no, it's indefinitely postponed.
that's what we're supposed to say officially.
my mom found out.
actually, I haven't really made up my mind yet, so if everybody could just
Oh, Honey.
give me a hug.
sweetie, you never know what's gonna happen. Okay?
for a while there, I thought l'd never get married.
finally, I had to put my foot down or my guy here would never have left
I'll get that.
Hello?
honey, it's their mother calling from Virginia.
it seems your grandmother had a bad fall.
your mother wants you to meet her there.
do you think she's okay in there?
it has been a while.
grandma, are you all right?
Yes, l'm just smoking a little marijuana.
look at that pattern.
is it just me, or is that the spitting image of Abraham Lincoln?
look, Halley, look. There's the mole.
Halley, you must see it!
you're the one who sees things no one else can see.
I do? - Yes.
mother, you're not supposed to be walking yet.
next time you fall like that, you're going to break your hip, then die.
you remember when we went to see our comet together?
Halley was too young to remember that.
no, I do remember.
you can't possibly. You remember hearing about it.
no, mom, I do remember.
why does no one trust me to know what I know anymore?
God.
God!
she doesn't even think that my own memories belong to me.
darling, she's your mother.
now, tell me about this fella of yours.
who told you about that?
grandma, it's really over.
first loves are never really over.
nobody's perfect, Sweetheart.
but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth your while.
Oh, boy! Do I have the munchies!
what about him? - He's not terrible looking.
Yeah, he's even cute in that geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.
Halley, it's...
it's Lewis.
Ashley, love of my life...
Iife of my heart...
once again...will you marry me?
Yes.
Yes. How crazy.
I can't believe it.
do it.
I owe you one.
for?
Macon's a really great guy.
see ya, Halley.
Hey. - Hi.
I had no idea that you guys were like hanging out.
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?
no, we're just
friends? - Yeah.
right.
no, it's fine because we had our thing, and it was fun... until it wasn't anymore, right?
no, that's not it.
when the going gets tough, it's best to just keep going, don't you think?
would you listen to me for a sec?
and to my bride.
thank you for showing me that socks don't need to be ironed...
that one needn't employ the Dewey decimal system for their CD collection...
and that, in the end, it doesn't make a whole lot of difference whether you start the toilet paper facing up or down.
despite what my parents taught me.
because, Ashley, you have shown me that life is worth embracing.
even if it means making a giant fool of yourself.
and lucky for me, you're willing to marry the guy who's been the biggest fool of all.
so here's to a lifetime of big, messy, wonderfully out-of-order moments with the most beautiful woman in the world
my bride.
your big sister is getting married in 3 1/2 hours.
you know if you get nervous, you can always...
you remember the sign.
of course. You taught it to me, remember?
so, you know. Just...
like that.
I'll do something. I'll yell, " fire, " okay?
okay. - Okay.
and we're back with the big dog of soft rock,
WDYG, 94 FM. " We dig the dog."
this is Daddy Dog himself, Len Martin, coming to you today on a very special day, 'cause one of my very own puppies--the eldest Ashley, is getting married.
Lorna, Honey, any words of wisdom coming from you, my very own newlywed?
waterproof mascara.
I'm gonna borrow yours, 'cause Daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby.
all right, let's kick off this Power Hour Of Love.
are you there? - Security?
Hey, give me--come on. This is my job!
my Halley?
I don't know how to get you to listen, but maybe
let him talk. - Just hear me out.
I suck with words.
but sometimes, words aren't the thing.
love isn't about words, it's about what you do.
and what I did...
running away, it was stupid.
we both know love's a big, scary, evil concept.
but if you feel it, it's gonna follow you around like a hungry dog no matter how far you run.
wait. I didn't mean to say love's a dog.
I just mean, l'm not going anywhere.
I love you, Halley.
if love beats us up, let's beat it up right back.
we could do this.
if you're ready to make the jump, l'll be right here to catch you.
and what a powerful Power Hour Of Love it has been.
this is Len Martin for WDYG, the Big Dog of soft rock.
that's right. Romance is in the air.
it's everywhere here today, folks.
this next song is going out to that young lady in question Miss Halley Martin and her big sister Ashley, 'cause Daddy loves you.
you look beautiful.
you look beautiful, Mom.
I'm not too old to wear pink?
no.
I look like a giant helium balloon.
come on. We have to go.
I'm gonna walk over.
I'll meet you there.
let's get Halley!
back seat. I need to lie down.
please be seated.
we have come together today to join in Holy Matrimony
Ashley Renee Martin and Lewis Gibson Warsher ll.
if any among you know any reason why this couple may not lawfully be married, declare it now or forever hold your peace.
do you, Lewis, promise to love, honor, and cherish Ashley from this day forward, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
and do you, Ashley, promise to love, honor, and cherish Lewis for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
I do.
the rings?
dear friends, let us ask God to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting.
no. No, the other finger. That's right.
Ashley, Lewis... - She's having the baby.
it is now my delight... - Please be quiet.
...and honor to declare you husband and wife.
you may now kiss the bride.
she's having the baby. Now.
right now?
Scarlett's having the baby. I have to go.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Scarlett's having the baby.
breathe.
wait, wait, wait! No.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
it's okay.
you're gonna have the baby!
thank you so much. Thanks.
you have got to do something. That was just a dreadful scene.
now the seating arrangement's gonna be a disaster.
one empty seat throws everything off.
mother, stop it. Okay?
it doesn't get any better than this.
squeeze my hand. It's okay. We're gonna get there.
I assume Daddy would like to be in the delivery room?
me? No, no. I
baby! - Mommy!
Hi, Sweetie. - I need you.
I'm her mother.
miss Smith? - lt's okay. Thank you.
don't leave me.
so, do you hate me?
not you, per se.
I hate the way your hair falls in your face.
and I hate the way your voice gets really low when you're serious.
and I hate the way you bite your bottom lip when you're nervous.
and the way your eyebrow goes--like that.
I hate that.
so, that's it?
you just hate the way I walk and talk and look?
no.
that Jedi mind trick thing?
I hate that.
don't give up on me.
I'm not.
but you are gonna regret ever having messed up.
cause l'm gonna make you pay for a long time.
but first...
you're going to take three steps towards me.
and you're going to wrap your arms around my waist.
okay, thanks for the lift.
where you going to look for him?
l don't know, but if l find a pink Cadillac, he'll be around somewhere.
so long.
who's that?
lt's Lon.
Hi, Lonnie. l'm making chili.
but if you want breakfast, l'll come out.
no, thanks.
Daisy, you seen my Uncle Hud?
l chicken-fried him a steak last night, about 7: 00.
haven't seen him since.
all right.
Daisy, l'm taking two doughnuts.
okay, honey.
just leave a dime on the counter.
all right.
lt's 26 after 6: 00
on a Thursday, and 7 1 degrees in the good ol' summertime.
on the Bobby Don Brewer Show.
must have had quite a brawl in here last night.
l had Hud in here last night is what l had.
sure looks it.
Mr. Larker!
Hey, there, Mr. Larker!
Hey, there, Lon!
you gonna rodeo this year, Lon?
not me. l ain't looking to get my stomach stepped on.
what you doing in town this early?
trying to run down Hud.
Hud? Didn't l see that big Cadillac car of his parked right down the street?
pretty sure l did.
l don't know if l'd go disturbing him, if l was you.
well, l ain't dying to, but l've been told to get him.
Hud?
Hud?
Honcho...
l just hope for your sake that this house is on fire.
well, l'm sorry to roust you out, Hud, but we got trouble at the ranch.
well, you've got trouble right here, bub.
l was just getting nicely tucked in.
you come tiptoeing through the tulips.
granddad wants you, and he said right now.
Oh, he said, " right now " ?
well, do you think maybe it would be all right with my old daddy if l stopped to button up my shirt?
Oh, come on, will you, Hud?
you got me out of the wrong side of bed this morning.
don't go snapping at my heels.
just liable to turn around and bite you.
Hud?
thank you, honey.
Hey. Hi, Joe.
which one of you two is coming out of my house at 6: 00 in the morning?
l asked you a question. Which one, damn it?
well, l hate to have to tell you, seeing it's my own nephew, but it's this snot-nosed kid here.
been looking for him all night.
just flushed him out a couple of minutes ago.
l'll kill the little punk. -Oh, now, Joe...
just let me at that kid. -Wait a minute.
l'll kill him, l'll kill him. -Now Joe, you know you got sugar diabetes. Just take it easy.
l'll handle this thing for you.
l don't need any help from you.
l can do it myself. Now, you get out of my way.
now, Joe, you can't afford to get worked-up, buddy boy.
l ain't gonna let that kid get away...
l'll lower his temperature some, l promise you.
all right, hotshot.
you and l are gonna finish this little discussion behind the woodshed.
thank you. Thanks a whole lot.
relax.
be able to charge a stud fee by the time that story gets around town.
Yeah, if l'm still alive.
l could have gotten hurt back there, you know that?
so could l.
ain't it lucky you were handy?
well, maybe you ought to take me along as a regular thing.
the pace would kill you, sonny.
and now that the dust has settled, what's so red-hot important that my daddy has to drag me back on my day off?
wants to ask your advice about something.
ask me?
he hasn't asked me about anything in 15 years.
just work out there from the shoulders down, myself.
you gonna be able to make it all day, after a night like you put in?
at a hundred years old like him, l don't need a week's sleep to be fresh.
he can't help being an old man, Hud.
boy, you sure do drive this thing, don't you?
that'll be Hud.
he's parked right in my flower bed.
good morning, Hud.
morning.
l'm sorry to cut into your time off.
Lonnie, close that screen door.
we're getting a lot of flies in here.
well, l see the house is still standing, and you're pouring coffee in your saucer, as usual.
how come you pushed the panic button on me?
we come up with a dead heifer in the night.
ls that what you dragged me back here for? A dead cow?
l'm kinda worried about this one.
she wasn't cut or crippled-looking.
no swellin' on her.
was there any Johnson grass or milkweed around?
nothing. This may be something l ought to know about.
jose and Jesse are out there now, keeping off the buzzards.
Lon, stay out of those berries.
they're going in the pie.
well, let's not stand around here till dinnertime.
l got other things to do today.
watch that cigarette ash.
lt's going in the pot.
l'll go bring the pickup around.
how come you're always running your car over my zinnias?
l've been trying to get those things to come up for two weeks.
don't plant them where l park.
you're cheerful this morning.
missy, your job is to keep house, not worry about my disposition.
frying pan's still on.
want a couple of eggs?
or did you have breakfast in bed?
Nope. l didn't quite get around to breakfast.
morning, boys.
Mr. Bannon.
morning, Mr. Bannon.
pretty hard to keep them birds away.
had to use a flashlight most of the night.
Ah, look at them buzzards.
they'll be back.
you couldn't scare 'em off with artillery.
l wish you wouldn't do that, Hud.
they keep the country clean.
besides, there's a law against killing buzzards.
well, l always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner.
and that's what l try to do.
sometimes l lean to one side of it.
sometimes l lean to the other.
l don't like to break the law on my place, Hud.
well, she ain't gonna sit up and tell us herself.
well, what do you think, Hud?
l don't know.
she looks clean to me.
well, something killed her.
l think l'll call up the state vet.
he might know.
well, what for?
this is our land.
l don't want any government men on it
any time, any place, anywhere.
this ain't nothing.
just leave her lay. Let the buzzards have her.
no, l don't believe l will.
before l go to bed, l'll call the government man and ask him to come out and take a look at her.
Yeah, that's the stuff.
bring some jellybean in here to tell you how to run your own business.
only don't ask me what l think from now on.
l'd like for you and Lon to stay out here for a while.
l'll take these boys back with me so they can snooze a little.
Lon, you take that water bag so you won't parch.
honcho, why don't you sit up with our sick friend here?
l got a healthy one in town that won't wait.
Hyah!
come on, hyah.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
boy, it's a good thing you showed up.
we blew a tire on the pickup, and l got to get this stuff back for dinner.
need any help, there, Jesse?
l'm all right, Hud. Thanks.
you think your hand would fall off if you opened the door?
you pick up my beer?
two six-packs.
that ought to see you till tomorrow.
keeping count on me?
l keep tripping over those empties, l know that.
boy, somebody in this car smells of Chanel No. 5, and it isn't me-- l can't afford it.
well, you sure weren't riding the range this afternoon, were you?
l sure wasn't.
no.
l just wish l knew where some gals get the time during the day.
l don't know-- by the time l get through scrubbing the kitchen floor, cleaning out the bathtub and hanging up the clothes...
they just drop everything, honey.
l suppose it does beat housework.
want an orange?
no.
l'll peel it for you.
no, thanks.
H-Hey, look, it says " Florida " on it.
we grow them right here in Texas, and then they send them in all the way from Florida.
that makes sense, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Oh, uh, the checker at the A&P market, he said it's Truman Peters' wife you're seeing.
ls that what he says?
Mm-hmm.
uh, he says she's got a bad temper.
he says her maid quit her 'cause she hollers so much.
well, our maid's gonna get canned 'cause she's talking too much.
Hey, you want a Fig Newton?
Nope.
just leave a little something for dinner, will ya?
l don't believe it.
you're still eating bread?
after l gave you steak and flour gravy and hominy and fried okra and onions and hot rolls?
well, it looked like a lot when we set down, but it sure melted away.
hud didn't want any dinner?
he's prettying up.
said he'd eat later.
what's for dessert?
you think a big freezer full of peach ice cream would hold you?
boy, l've been waiting all winter long for those locker-plaid Alberta peaches.
Oh, is that what you've been waiting all winter for, sugar?
how about those peachy pinups you keep hidden in with your shorts and socks?
that's my private drawer.
you stay out of there, Alma.
l'm a girl, honey.
they don't do a thing for me.
l'll dish up the ice cream, Mr. Bannon.
you have it on the front porch. lt's cooler.
that'll be fine, Alma.
go on, before you wet your didie.
alma!
Alma.
yeah?
alma!
Yeah!
give me a clean, white shirt.
boy, you're real big with the " please " and " thank you, " aren't you?
please get up off your lazy butt and get me a clean, white shirt. Thank you.
had a little trouble getting the lipstick out of this one.
just try the brand you're wearing.
maybe it'll wash out easier.
let's not.
look, you ain't getting any younger.
what are you saving it for?
the tabs are in the collar.
hear the whippoorwill?
l think there's two of them.
you know, l've never seen one of those birds in my whole life.
all l do is hear them calling across the flat.
what are you thinking about, Lon?
Oh, l don't know.
just looking up ahead, l guess.
you know, to what's coming.
thinking about your worries and your ambitions, are you?
Yeah, that, having a car of my own to tear around in, and girls.
well, l expect you'll get your share of what's good, and a boy like you deserves it.
Hey, it's getting late.
boy, my daddy sure looks like his collar was choking him.
those were his Sunday best.
l don't remember him any.
l do.
you don't carry a picture of Hud around with you, do you?
no, l don't.
but he's your son, same as my dad was.
Yep, he is.
what are you holding against him, Granddad?
he knows, and you don't need to.
here you go.
Ah.
Thanks.
ain't you having any?
a little too many calories.
l'm trying to lose a couple of pounds.
listen, Mr. Bannon, if you don't mind, l'm gonna leave those dishes till later.
l just gotta get off these feet.
the kitchen's your department, Alma.
Yeah, l've seen enough of it for today.
Hud, are you planning on going back to town tonight?
well, l didn't get washed up to sit on the front porch and listen to the frogs mate.
l'd like for you to make it back here before morning.
the vet'll be here early.
all right.
lt's pretty good. Peachy.
Oh, you can't get much air through this nylon.
well, you ought to go around in a sarong, Alma, like they do in the South Seas.
Oh, yeah, that'd be a lot of laughs.
you're half native already.
l haven't seen you in a pair of shoes since you come to work here.
Oh, l wore them once.
l've things to get married in-- black satin pumps.
l don't have them anymore or the man either.
l'm going to get to town.
alma, you want to blow some foam off of some beer?
no, thanks.
l'm going to get up out of this swing.
set some biscuits, go to bed.
l'll settle for half that action.
l'll go with you, Hud.
well, what big deal you got lined up, sport?
a snow cone or something?
no, l just thought l'd catch a ride with you, that's all.
all right, come on, let's make tracks.
you didn't need me for anything, did you, Granddad?
no. No, you go on, if you like.
just be careful.
you drive, sport.
what was that all about?
lt's a story l'll tell you someday when l'm drunk.
come on, gig this thing a little, will you?
eh, it's a lonesome old night, isn't it?
ain't they all.
boy, l love that sound.
goes right through me.
lt scares the hell out of the cattle.
know what trains always make me think about?
no, but l got a strong feeling you're going to tell me.
l guess l just like 'em, that's all.
keys.
well, golly.
boy, just look at that Las Vegas saddle.
you couldn't lift that hunk of junk on a horse with a crane.
Yeah, it is pretty noisy.
where you think you're going?
l'm just tagging along. -Not with me, you ain't.
you go tie on a couple of Dr Peppers.
l'll see ya.
Hey, come up here and have a drink with us!
come on, now!
Hi, Mr. Kirby.
Hi.
read that one?
Yeah, twice.
lt's about the best book you ever had on your paperback stand.
pretty steamy, ain't it?
Oh, l don't know.
people in it seem a lot like the ones l see.
did you read the part where the sergeant gets her for the first time?
Yeah, l read that part.
Hi.
l sure have seen an awful lot of you for one night.
l'm just headed for the square, is all.
where are you headed?
well, just to keep you up-to-date, l am making my way to Mrs. Reuben Fletcher's house.
l don't think that's a house you're likely to have heard very much about.
well, l've heard some.
l am out of my three- cornered pants, you know.
l have been for some time.
how old are you?
Fantan-- a fast 1 7.
boy, when l...
when l was your age, l couldn't get enough of anything.
that was the summer you were born.
your ma died...
and your daddy was feeling a little wild about things.
he bought us a '27 Chevy.
kept it tied together with baling wire, hit every honky-tonk in the country.
l don't know which we run the hardest that car or them country girls who came to them dances.
boy! We do-si-do'd and chased a lot of girlish butts around that summer.
now, l wouldn't mind going that route myself.
come on along.
no, l don't think so.
all right.
Hey, wake up.
come on, Lonnie.
open your eyes.
you going to stay here till dinnertime?
what do you want?
l want you to get up.
l can't stay here rasslin' around with you all morning.
why not? l kind of like it.
Yeah, l bet you do.
that's enough out of you.
now, come on, get up.
can't do that, Alma.
are you sleeping in the raw again?
Mm-hmm.
listen, l got two pair of nice, ironed cotton pajamas in there.
how come you're not using them?
l don't know, they strangle me.
Mm-hmm. Come on.
what do you sleep in?
ln my own room, with the door locked.
you ever wear any of those little, uh, shorty things?
what kind of question is that?
just wonder.
does your mind usually run in that direction?
Yeah, it seems to.
boys with impure thoughts come out in acne.
did you know that?
Oh, that's all bull, Alma.
keep it up, you'll see.
hurry up.
the vet's coming this morning.
well, let's get away from this stink.
l got all l need here.
Mr. Bannon...
l'm going to ask you to get your cattle together, all of them.
l'm going to have to make an inspection.
an inspection for what?
well, for what killed that heifer.
l hope l'm wrong, but l'm very much afraid you got the worst kind of trouble l think that cow died of foot-and-mouth disease.
Oh, me.
l never thought it'd be anything like that.
well, let's have it.
what are we in for?
well, y'all get your herds together.
we're going to have to take some samples.
bring in a few healthy calves and a couple of horses from outside, infect them artificially, and then...
just wait and see what happens.
l'll tell you what'll happen
they turn up sick, you kill them.
that's right, isn't it, mister?
lf the calves turn up sick and the horses don't, it's foot-and-mouth-- you got to.
the last bad outbreak in the United States, the government had to kill over 77, 000 head of cattle, plus that many sheep and goats.
even 20, 000 deer.
lt's a terrible thing.
l just bought me 20 head of Mexican cows down South.
could they be the bad ones?
uh, could be.
lf there were, you're going to have to get rid of every cow that's been in contact with them.
well, you're talking about all the animals l own.
l know l am.
l hope l'm wrong.
l hope it turns out to be something else, so we won't ever have to talk about it again.
looks like l landed in the wrong place again.
uh, you guys get on. There's some fence to fix.
Yeah, how about that?
you going to let them shoot your cows out from underneath you on account of a schoolbook disease?
you getting that old, Homer?
l wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't satisfy him.
you think they'd agree to that?
Yeah, they don't have to agree to nothing
they're the law.
you can agree with them till hell freezes over for all the good it'll do you.
Yeah, but that Mr. Burris seemed like a reasonable man.
you think they'd come in here and liquidate?
hell, yeah, they'll liquidate, you got what they say you got.
now, you look a-here.
you've had 24 of my 34 years working for you on this ranch, and, Daddy, you have had top-grade cheap labor.
l shoveled manure out of barns for you.
you got my calluses, for what?
your blessings the day you die?
now, damn it, l want out of this spread what l put into it.
well, you got a proposal to make to me, Hud?
you get on the telephone tonight and sell every breed cow you own.
they haven't got a chain on you yet.
would that be your way to getting out of a tight?
well, l can ship the whole herd out before they begin the test.
you mean, try and pass bad stuff off on my neighbors, who wouldn't even know what they was getting?
eh, you don't know it's bad stuff.
Aw, ship them out of state, unload them up north before the news gets out.
and take a chance on starting an epidemic in the entire country.
why, this whole country is run on epidemics!
where you been?
epidemics are big business
price-fixing, crooked TV shows, income tax finagling, souped up expense accounts.
how many honest men you know?
you take the sinners away from the saints, you're lucky to end up with Abraham Lincoln.
so l say, let's us put our bread in some of that gravy while it is still hot.
you're an unprincipled man, Hud.
well, don't let that fuss you.
l mean, you've got enough for both of us.
this afternoon's been a regular bitch.
you out of poop?
l'm just having a breather.
well, why don't you go back to the ranch and grab yourself a nap?
no, l'll hold up my end of it.
Yeah, l guess you would.
granddad!
found your longhorns out near ldia Ridge.
government's going to have a hard time trying to inspect them.
those big horns'll never go through a chute.
there ain't many left in the country, are there, Granddad?
no, they're dying out.
l just keep them for old time's sake.
keep them to remind me of how things was.
everything we had come from their hides
our furniture, our ropes, our-our clothes, our hats.
granddad... let's turn them loose.
no, Lon, that wouldn't be the thing to do.
they got to go along with the rest.
granddad.
why, thank you, Lon.
l shouldn't have brought you out here tonight, not after the day you put in.
Oh, if the picture's any good, l'll wake up, don't you worry.
looks like you're the only one around here who ain't got somebody whose knee you can pinch.
Oh, l think l can stand it.
you wouldn't think they'd pay 65 cents to come here and do it.
they can go up in the hayloft for nothing.
come on, you miners 49ers.
let's all join in and sing that old favorite, " Clementine. "
just follow the bouncing ball.
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling...
Oh, my darling Clementine
thou are lost and gone forever
dreadful sorry, Clementine ln the cavern, in the canyon
excavating for a mine
dwelt a miner 49er
and his daughter, Clementine
Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, Clementine
thou art lost and gone forever
dreadful sorry, Clementine.
you going to get your mouth around all that?
going to try.
Hi, Hud.
how are you, sport?
ls that Truman Peters' wife with Hud?
l think so.
want me to call him over?
no, no, just leave him to his own business.
got a half a buck?
okay, come on on back.
aren't you going to give me the change?
Hey, hey.
well, let's make a party out of this.
daddy, this not too natural blonde here is Mrs. Truman Peters.
how do you do?
how do you do, Mr. Bannon?
'wild Horse " Homer Bannon, Lily.
that's what he used to be known as.
and this kind of gangly youth over there is my nephew Lon.
you may have just noticed, but my daddy hasn't asked us to sit down.
that's 'cause he doesn't want to socialize with me.
he's a little fussy about the company he keeps.
Yeah, you're a married woman, Lily.
that doesn't go down very well with him.
he's a man of high principals and what have you.
he doesn't believe in any loose living at all.
lsn't that right, Homer?
granddad.
Hey, Homer, you okay?
get me... get me home, boy.
roll down that window a little, will you, Hud?
Ah, that's good.
the place back there seemed a little short of air.
maybe you just got a little too much sun today.
well, whatever.
no need to pose such a long face about it.
l feel better now.
when we get home, l'm going to fix you some salipadicha.
Yeah, yeah, that'll settle me right down.
he dropped right off.
he's beginning to look kind of worn out, isn't he?
sometimes l forget how old he is.
l guess l just don't want to think about it.
time you started.
well, l know he's gonna die someday.
l know that much.
he is.
makes me feel like somebody dumped me into a cold river.
happens to everybody.
horses, dogs, men.
nobody gets out of life alive.
l'll give you a hand upstairs.
Lon'll take care of me.
suit yourself.
good night, Hud.
thanks for the game, boys.
you can have another shot at me next payday.
you got a cigarette?
Yeah.
then l wish you wouldn't keep me hanging around on the front porch.
makes me feel like l'm selling something.
all right, come on in.
they're a little squashed.
lt's all right, they'll do.
well, l see you got things fixed up some.
l try.
looks pretty good.
except your sweet potato plant over here has got the blight.
l can't seem to get one started.
well, they need a lot of tender loving care, honey.
same as the rest of us.
l'll keep it in mind.
could l have a match?
well, what do we got here?
'Jiffy...
portable hair dyer. "
'...triple screen. "
hmm.
automatic toaster.
what have you been doing?
a little rustling down at the five and dime?
l go in for those prize contests.
how Shiny Shampoo changed my life, in 20 words or less. "
you know, they give free two-week trips to Europe.
but l end up with the fountain pens and the Japanese binoculars.
Yeah, won me a turkey raffle once, but it was fixed.
l got to be pretty friendly with one of 'em gals picking the numbers.
lt figures.
how much you take the boys for tonight?
20 dollars and some change.
you're a dangerous woman to have around.
l'm a good poker player.
you're a good housekeeper.
you're a good cook, you're a good laundress.
what else you good at?
at taking care of myself.
you shouldn't have to, a woman looks like you do.
Oh, that's what my ex-husband used to tell me...
before he took my wallet and my gasoline credit card and left me stranded in a downtown motel in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
What'd you do to make him take to the hills?
you wear your curlers to bed or something?
Ed's a gambler.
he's probably up at Vegas or Reno right now, dealing at night, losing it all back in the daytime.
Oh, well, a man like that sounds no better than a heel.
aren't you all?
honey, don't go shooting all the dogs 'cause one of them's got fleas.
l was married to Ed for six years.
only thing he was ever good for was to scratch my back where l couldn't reach it.
you still got that itch?
off and on.
well, let me know when it gets to bothering you.
now, what we're doing, Mr. Bannon, is injecting these cows and horses with specimens that are taken from your herd.
ln three to six days, we should know what we want to know.
ya!
move on in there!
get in that chute!
move on in there!
Ah-ha-ha-ha! Hey!
go over there! Ya!
you all right, Lon?
she...
she kicked you into the fence.
you skinned your head a little.
boy, you caught a lick!
better get back to work.
boys'll be on you for a week, you quit 'cause you dented your head a little.
no need to rush him.
you all right, Lon?
Mm...
Whoa!
Oh, you've had it, fantan.
now, get him to bed.
all right, Jack, back to work.
you know, all this time, l thought you were skinny!
you weigh a ton.
can't seem to get my head on straight.
get in there, cow.
Hud, l think l'm going to lose my breakfast.
not over me, you ain't.
you hold your fire till we get to the house.
sugar, you're white as a sheet.
alma, you're getting flour all over me.
what happened?
Ah, one of the cows cuddled up to him.
Ow! -Shouldn't a doctor look at him?
pay five bucks and some iodine and aspirin, he'll mend.
well, that's about as far as l go.
l draw the line at bedpans.
Thanks, Hud.
you can goldbrick for the rest of the day.
just don't try to stretch it into two.
here, let's get those boots off.
cold lemonade.
here.
Oh, come on.
they're only lemon seeds.
Mmm.
that better?
you ought to doze off now.
gee, Alma, you're cool.
you smell of lemon.
Alma?
what is it, sugar?
you're really beautiful.
Oh, sure l am.
you're one of the best people there ever was.
you're good to me, Alma.
ln fact, you're good, period.
you be good, too. Get some sleep.
morning, Granddad.
well, how are you today, Lonnie?
good, real good.
boy, have l been sawing wood up there.
looks like l slept around the clock.
you know, l feel almost like working, for a change!
well, what do you got for me?
patch a little fence?
pull up some weeds?
work a few calves?
well, l don't guess we'll do anything much.
l don't see any sense in wasting work until l find out about my cattle.
you bet.
Yeah, we're just gonna roll over and play dead and let them shovel dirt in our faces.
lf l don't get a clean bill of health on my cattle, we are just about dead.
dead broke.
we've been breeding and crossbreeding this beef all our lives to get us the best stock in the country.
we're going to end up with the government paying us four bits on the dollar for 'em.
poor but honest.
that's us.
well, we ain't sure of anything yet.
we're just gonna have to sit and wait it out.
don't get sores on your butt doing it.
l can do without that noise, Lon.
now, go stretch your legs a little, will ya?
well, where's that bottle?
had myself a bottle of Jack Daniel's stashed in that cupboard in there.
you drank it.
when?
lnstead of dinner, Wednesday night.
don't remember.
lf you think l've been nipping at it, l don't drink anything but Tokay wine.
Yeah, l bet you keep your little finger crooked while you're doing it.
well, why don't you go stick your head in the water trough and sober up for lunch?
now don't you find me in control of myself?
hate to see you walk a straight line.
that's easy.
l don't like setting passes.
we'll ease into it, then.
there's another one coming up on your right.
don't you ever ask?
well, the only question l ever ask any woman is, " What time is your husband coming home? "
what's keeping you?
you're over the age of consent, ain't you?
way over.
let's get our shoelaces untied, what do you say?
l'd say l've been asked with a little more finesse in my time.
yeah...
hmm?
l wouldn't want to come on crude. No, madam.
l'll bring you a two-pound box of candy, maybe a bottle of perfume, from the drugstore.
how about some colored beads and wampum?
whatever it takes to make you trade them.
no, thanks.
l've done my time with one cold-blooded bastard.
l'm not looking for another.
lt's too late, honey, you already found him.
you hardly touched your plate, Mr. Bannon.
nothing to do with your cooking, Alma.
l just ain't very hungry.
hear anything from the vets?
no.
they're taking their own sweet time about it.
well, l ain't going to sit around here and stew.
kiwanis are waiting for me.
you gonna be in that pig scramble tonight, Hud?
Yup, see if l can make the Bannons look good for a change.
you honchos want to come on in, there's plenty of room in the cheering section.
they're letting ladies in free tonight, Alma.
you just might qualify.
Hey, you know, that's the first time Hud ever asked me to go anyplace in his whole life.
l wonder why he did that.
lonesome, l imagine.
just trying to scare up a little company.
Hud, lonesome?
he can get more women coming than anybody else around.
well, that ain't necessarily much.
they ain't necessarily company, neither.
women just like to be around something dangerous part of the time.
even Hud can get lonesome once in a while.
well, l wouldn't mind watching him chase those squealers.
well, then, we'll go on in.
l'll stay home. l don't like pigs.
now let's give these kids a hand.
now, applaud for the kid that you like the best.
that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
looks like number ten won it.
all right, now you've all seen one kind of twistin'.
you're about to see another kind.
we've got ten able-bodied men going to tie themselves in knots trying to catch ten of the fastest greased pigs you've ever seen in your life.
now the first man that catches his pig and brings it back to this little square here in front of the judges stand is going to be the winner.
now if you boys'll come on in, we'll get this started, come on.
you guys got the pigs ready down there, Marlon?
you bet!
okay.
let's go then.
come on, let's go there.
Arnold, you're outside there. Step in, will ya?
Hey, Wag, pull your hat off, will ya?
let's go.
all right, boys, now when l say " three, " we'll go.
one, two, three-- go!
off they go. Look at them go.
well, it looks like we got a winner-- Hud Bannon.
Hud, that pig looks about as dirty as you do.
towel back there?
folks, we sure do thank you for turning out tonight, and we hope you enjoyed yourself.
Whew!
we look forward to seeing you next year at the annual cotton festival.
nice going.
wish l could still get around the way you do, Hud.
boy, you sure do churn up that dust.
well, l'm going to kick up a little more dust before the night's over.
anybody interested?
well, that's enough excitement for me, l guess.
l'll be getting back. Lon?
Oh, l don't know. lt's still kind of early.
l might just stick around with Hud for a while.
well, l'll leave the door open for you.
Yeah.
hitch up your pants, fantan.
l'm going to get cleaned up, then l'll buy you a drink.
you want to put a little kick in that?
sure, okay.
come on, l can handle it.
whoa, whoa.
kind of pretty girl.
don't let me cramp you.
Oh, l wouldn't make any kind of move at her.
why not?
you ain't nailed down, are you?
well, that's what l call a woman and a half.
you're a pretty good-looking kid.
you dab down that cowlick and button your collar up over your Adam's apple, you... you might just make out.
l wouldn't mind driving her the long way home.
well, you ought to take a crack at that.
get all the good you can out of 1 7, 'cause it sure wears out in one hell of a hurry.
Ah, my trouble is l got to like a girl a lot before l can work up to anything.
l mean, like her as a person.
honcho, you're a regular idealist.
and what's wrong with that?
l don't know, l just ain't never tried it.
well...
suppose you think l'm a jerk.
what do you care what l think?
Ah, this is probably going to hand you a big laugh...
...but l do.
you have another little drink, and l'll have another little drink, and then maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.
well, l think l'll shove some change in that juke.
Hi.
what are you gawking at?
well, l ain't gawking.
l don't like fresh kids.
nobody's getting fresh, mister, that l know about.
l think l'll take you out in the alley and jar some of your teeth loose.
are you having words with this youngster about something?
l'm about to put him into the hospital.
ls that so?
why, has he been bothering you?
no. No, he ain't bothering me.
lt's her he's bothering.
well, you didn't, uh, offer him any encouragement by any chance, did you there, young lady?
no.
that's funny.
l was sitting way over on the other side of the room, and l got a little bit encouraged.
maybe it's the way you move around inside that dress.
all right, smart guy, l'll take you instead.
Oh, l don't want to be hoggish.
Lon, you want a piece of him?
Ah. -Whoo!
Whoo! Whoo!
boy, that is what l call one hell of a night.
l can do that about six times a week.
well, you don't win them all, you know.
well, l would if you were backing me all the time.
Hey, that'd make quite a combination, wouldn't it?
nobody'd ever mess with the Bannons, that's for sure.
Yeah, felt like old times there for a little while.
your daddy and l used to take them all on a Saturday night.
Yeah, he must have been a pretty good old boy.
what, Norman?
Yeah.
he was the kind of guy
when l was a kid so l could swipe some of it.
let me take a girl away from him once in a while like l done it on my own.
he was bigger than you, all right.
he had a bigger wallet, but l'll tell you something.
when you ain't being a pain in the tail, you remind me a lot of him.
l do? -Yeah, you sure do.
well, then how come you and me don't hit it off so good?
l got short arms.
hell, there ain't never been anybody like old Norman, never will be.
he was one-way-out boy.
claimed he could hear the grass grow.
he got me to go down to this pasture one night to listen.
after three or four hours of just nipping away at that bottle to keep the dew off of us, l swore l could hear it, too.
that's the night l wracked up the car.
piled up on Sampson Creek Bridge.
he died in a half an hour.
l didn't even have a mark on me.
Yeah, l wonder if your daddy's hearing the grass now, growing up over his grave.
that story ought to cool you off some.
lt doesn't.
Fantan, either you're softhearted, or softheaded.
l don't know which.
Oh, it was sad, dear Lord lt was sad, dear Lord lt was sad when the great ship went down to the bottom of the
husbands and wives
little children lost their lives lt was sad when the great ship went down
Oh, it was sad, dear Lord lt was sad, dear Lord lt was sad when the great ship went down...
shh, shh, shh, shh.
Oh, it was shh, dear Lord lt was shh, dear Lord lt was shh...
Hey, Granddad.
all right, he's got you drunk.
what else has he given you a taste for?
all we had was a...
...couple of drinks is all.
l don't remember you being a teetotaler.
l drank. l don't object to his having whiskey.
well, something seems to be eating away at your liver.
you, Hud.
like always.
Hey, what are you climbing on Hud for?
you think a lot of Hud, do you?
you think he's a real man.
well, you're being took in.
you listen to him, honcho.
he's my daddy, and he knows.
l know you.
you're smart.
you got your share of guts.
you can talk a man into trusting you and a woman into wanting you.
well, then, l got it made, ain't l?
to hear you tell it.
Oh, why don't you get it off your chest?
you've been griping at me all this time as what l done to Norman.
you were drunk and careless of your brother.
you had 15 years to get over it.
that's half of my life.
that's not our quarrel and never has been.
Oh, the hell it isn't.
no, boy.
l was sick of you a long time before that.
well...
isn't life full of surprises?
and all along l thought it was...
cause of what l'd done to my big brother.
l took that hard, but l buried it.
well, all right, l'll bite.
what turned you sour on me?
not that l give a damn.
just that, Hud.
you don't give a damn.
that's all.
that's the whole of it.
you still don't get it, do you?
you don't care about people, Hud.
you don't give a damn about them.
granddad...
Oh, you got all that charm going for you, and it makes the youngsters want to be like you.
that's the shame of it.
cause you don't value nothing.
you don't respect nothing.
you keep no check on your appetites at all.
you live just for yourself, and that makes you not fit to live with.
my mama loved me, but she died.
why pick on Hud, Granddad?
he ain't the only one.
just about everybody around here is like him, one way or another.
well, that's no cause for rejoicing, is it?
Lonnie, little by little, the look of the country changes because of the men we admire.
l still think you nailed him pretty hard.
did l?
maybe.
old people get as hard as their arteries sometimes.
you're just going to have to make up your own mind one day about what's right and what's wrong.
Where's that cotton-picking housekeeper of ours?
l want something to eat, and l don't want any hesitating about it.
lt's late, Hud.
she's asleep.
well, ain't that just keen?
paying her good money to sleep, and l'm starving to death.
well, maybe l can fry you up an egg sandwich.
forget it.
Oh, get your butt out of here.
l can't think with you standing around.
knock some people on their tails around here.
you just might be one of them.
go on, get out of here!
whoa, there.
boy, they mean trouble.
kind of wish l'd have stayed out of bull riding.
well, from the look of them, you ain't gonna be riding very far.
well, thanks, buddy.
l better go check my gear.
never mind your gear.
you ought to go check your head.
that bull's gonna eat you up.
how are you, hotrod?
Hi, Hud.
got a good seat for the show this afternoon?
they're getting two bucks for those bleachers over there.
be my guest.
well, this is ten dollars, Hud.
lt's good. l didn't print it.
well, thank you.
stick with me, honcho.
your jeans will be full of change.
how come?
well, l'll tell you.
l put on a clean, white shirt this morning, and l saw me a lawyer.
there's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard anymore, you can make 'em let go, whether they like it or not.
what are you pulling on Granddad now?
something pretty raw, kid.
Yeah. lt sounds like it.
you take your dough. l don't want it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
don't look down your nose at me, sonny boy.
l'm gonna get old, too.
and l don't aim to end up on county relief with a bowl of soup and two cigarettes a day, if l behave myself.
l want what l worked for.
l got a right to it.
you know something, honcho?
you don't look out for yourself, and the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box.
now you have fun, you hear?
Hud.
you're up awful late.
l got a lot on my mind.
come on in.
take a load off your feet.
talked to the vets today?
l talked to them, but l didn't get a whole lot of information out of them.
Yeah, you didn't expect to, did you?
the government man wants you to know something, he'll call you or send you a telegram.
they said they was watching the test animals pretty close, but they had nothing showed up yet.
Hud?
Yes, sir.
what's this tricky deal you're up to?
Lon tells me you're gonna pull the rug out from under me.
that's right.
l haven't got all the rough edges ironed out yet, but l can give you an idea.
the main thing is you, old man.
you're getting too old to make the grade.
whether they liquidate us or not when this thing is over, you just better get yourself a rocking chair and get out of my way.
what in the hell do you mean?
when an old man goes off and buys himself a bunch of sick Mexican cows, it means he's over the hill.
you got the incompetence, Daddy, and the hotrod's too young to take things over.
just might get the court to appoint me guardian of your property.
l don't know.
lf l don't get it one way, l'm gonna get it another.
well, you're badly mistaken about all this.
l'll be the only one to run this ranch while l'm above ground.
after that, you may get part of it.
l don't know.
but you can't get control of this place.
no way in the world.
don't go making any bets on that.
maybe l treated you too hard.
l don't doubt l made some mistakes.
a man don't always do what's right.
Ah, Daddy, you ain't never been wrong.
been handing out the ten tablets of law from whatever little hill you could find to climb up on since l was a kid.
shape up or ship out.
that's the way you runs things around here.
wild-eyed Homer Bannon passing out scripture and verse like you wrote it yourself.
so l just naturally had to go bad in the face of so much good.
Hud, how did a man like you come to be a son to me?
well, that's easy.
l wasn't no bundle left on your doorstep.
wasn't found in no bulrushes.
you've got the same feelings below your belt as any other man.
that's how you got stuck with me for a son, whether you like it or not.
he was just so drunk, Alma.
did he hurt you?
should l take you to town, get you a doctor?
go on out of here.
well, what are you looking at?
l'm looking at you, Hud.
Oh, climb off it.
you've been wanting to do pretty much the same thing.
and wanting to wallow her from the day she got here.
Yeah, l been wanting to do it.
but not mean like you.
here comes Mr. Burris.
good morning.
good morning.
your timing's off. You missed breakfast.
Thanks, but l've eaten.
l guess you got something to tell us, or you wouldn't be here.
l guess the tests are done.
Yes, sir, they're done.
you got the worst thing you could have.
and there's no cure at all?
none we know of.
lt's like a bolt of lightning
it won't hurt you till it hits, then it hurts a lot.
your cows are public enemies now.
you gotta handle this thing fast before it spreads.
well, what do l do?
just drive them into a pit and shoot them?
l can't abide that.
l know it's a terrible thing even to think about.
l've seen it during the Depression.
lt's a sight worse to see than it is to think about.
look here, Mr. Bannon, you're getting up in years.
you can afford to slow down.
the rest won't hurt your grass any.
you might even sell a few oil leases.
my daddy thinks that oil is something you stick in your salad dressing.
lf there's oil down there, you can get it sucked up after l'm under there with it.
but l don't like it, and l don't aim to have it.
there'll be no holes punched in this land while l'm here.
they ain't going to come in and grade no road so the wind can blow me away.
that's all to me.
what can l do with a bunch of rotten oil wells?
l can't ride out every day and prowl amongst them, like l can my cattle.
l can't breed them or tend them or rope them or chase them or nothing.
l can't feel a smidgen of pride in them.
cause they ain't none of my doing.
there's money in it.
l don't want that kind of money.
l want mine to come from something that keeps a man doing for himself.
we're much obliged to you for coming out in person to tell us.
start shootin'.
didn't take long.
lt don't take long to kill things.
not like it does to grow.
well, there's a couple we missed.
l'll get them.
where do you think you're going, mister?
to finish this job.
somebody needs to.
well, you just close that gate.
l'll kill them two myself, seeing as how l raised them.
something wrong with you, mister?
there's no guarantee you'll do it.
he just said he would.
you get in the car.
we're going down and finish buying those carcasses, and then we're leaving.
Mr. Bannon can handle the rest of this without us bothering him.
you just get along, Mr. Burris.
l know none of this here ain't your doing.
you see about the burying, and then get that fellow there off'n my ranch.
all l can say is l'm sorry.
l'm sure sorry.
he ain't such a bad fella.
just got a cruddy job.
boys...
l don't plan to have any work around here for some time.
l can't afford to keep you on till things get better, so...
...l'll just have to let you go.
give me the rifle.
Lord, but l've chased them longhorns many a mile.
l don't know if l can kill them.
but l guess l can.
guess this is the worst thing that ever happened to you.
Oh, l'll get over it, if my health don't go to failing me.
Lon, you go away someplace.
well, them old bulls are hard to kill.
drag them away and bury them!
bury them quick!
go on!
did you call about the bus for me?
Yeah, it leaves at 10: 26.
and can l buy my ticket on it?
Yeah. They said that'd be okay.
Alma?
l got $200 calf money, -if you're short. -You just keep it.
well, l'm ready.
wish you weren't going off and leaving us, Alma.
you look after your grandpa.
he's getting old and feeble. He's your job now.
we need you around here.
l sure do.
you'll get along just fine.
l wish you'd stay.
well...
l been all over this cow country, looking for the exact right place and the exact right people, so once l got stopped, l wouldn't have to be movin' again.
and it just hasn't worked out.
good-bye, honey.
you take care of yourself.
don't you be lazy, now.
how are you, Peewee?
looks like we're losing a good cook.
maybe we should, uh...
boosted your salary a little.
you ain't letting that little ruckus we had run you off, are you?
as far as l can get on a bus ticket.
you saying that l'm the first guy that ever stuck his foot in your door?
Oh, no.
the first one that ever got rough, huh?
well, l'm sorry.
lt ain't my style.
l don't usually get rough with my women.
generally don't have to.
you're rough on everybody.
so they tell me.
you want to know something funny?
lt would have happened eventually, without the roughhousin'.
you look pretty good without your shirt on, you know.
sight of that through the kitchen window made me put down my dish towel more than once.
well, why didn't you speak up sooner?
l'll remember you, honey.
you're the one that got away.
come on, there, boy, git!
stupid knucklehead, what'd you hit the brakes for?
you got your life's work in front of you paying for this car.
granddad's out here.
he's crawling in the road!
grandad, what happened?
are you hurt?
l wanted to... take a look around the place.
l fell off my horse.
this old man's hurt pretty bad.
let me up.
a man ain't to crawl.
take it easy.
Lonnie, take my car, get to the ranch, call an ambulance, tell them to get here quick.
and tell them we got an awful sick man here.
lt won't start!
all right, forget it.
forget it!
there's a bottle of whisky in the dash.
bring it over.
come on, easy, easy, old man.
don't make me drink that stuff.
Lonnie, go on down to the main road, try to flag a car down, get some help up here.
go on, move.
don't send him away, Hud.
l'm right here, Grandad, don't you worry.
l feel kind of cold.
everything's going to be all right.
l don't know if l want it to be.
don't talk like that.
you're going to be just fine.
l feel like throwing in the sponge.
like giving up.
you've never quit on anything in your whole life.
hud there is waiting on me...
and he ain't a patient man.
he isn't gone, is he?
Yeah.
l meant to buy him a brand-new, blanket-lined jacket...
and give it to him sometime or other.
Lonnie...
Hey.
lt was the best thing.
man, he was wore out, and he knew it.
he didn't seem so bad.
he didn't seem so bad off at all.
well, he was.
trying to get up, hurting himself.
he couldn't have made it.
Lonnie, any way in this world, he couldn't have made it another hour.
he could if he had wanted to.
you fixed it so he didn't want to anymore.
you don't know the whole story.
Yeah, him and me fought many and many a round together.
but l guess you could say that l helped him about as much as he ever helped me.
how did you help him, Hud?
by trying to sell him out?
by taking the heart out of him?
by making him give up and quit?
ls that how you helped him?
he ain't in any loaf-around eternal life.
he's the way he always was enjoying his good horses, looking after the land, trying to figure out ways to beat the dry weather and wind.
you better settle down, boy.
you still got the graveyard in front of you.
l know what you're feeling, my boy, but look at it this way-- he's gone to a better place.
l don't think so.
not unless dirt is a better place than air.
well, we took him to the graveyard and put him down.
lt's all over with now.

ain't you a little bit green to go cutting loose on your own?
well, we'll see.
l was about your age when l went in the army.
granddaddy had bought me a Mars candy bar down at the station, and he said to me, " Character's the only thing l got to give you to be a man. "
well, l guess he was kind of worried.
you're trying so hard to get out of the draft and all.
Honcho!
l just wanted you to know that...
if you don't make your million, you can always come back here and work for me.
l won't be back this way.
well, l guess you've come to be of your granddaddy's opinion that l ain't fit to live with.
that's too bad.
Yeah, we might have whooped it up some, you and me.
that's the way you used to want it.
l used to.

it's fantastic. Just taste it.
I'm feeling sleepy. I'm going.
why interfere? You fool.
there's magic in your hands.
it's the first time that I taste such tasty sweet. It's the truth.
you might consider me to be a fool.
I'm a fan of your singing, your dancing and now.
.I'm a fan of your cooking too.
you haven't answered my question.
why were you awake for me?
do you know about your drawback?

Tuffy is asking the child to keep on smiling always!
grandma and grandpa will dance too!
listen to what the kid is saying.
he's asking you to be closely related to him.
son, this uncle of yours is up to something.
if I don't get her, I'm sure to renounce life and become a priest.
come home and take the alms.
live long, child. The child is very lucky.
these fireworks. His brightness.
they reveal the happiness of the heart!
the earth and the sky are happy for our baby.
and it's apt that at such time, the father of the child arrives.
Papa, this is the model of Prem's factory.
Kailashnath, you started from just a small room.
Rajesh has striven to reach this stage.
and now, Prem will make sure that he does his bit for success.

you just wait and watch the fun.
this night is truly happy.
this is a fantastic gathering.
stop this poetry now and get into the mood of the game.
son, for how long will we continue sitting over here.
what do we have to do?
we will be playing the music.
this pillow will be passed around.
whenever the music stops, whoever has this pillow is a goner.
we will punish that person in any which way that we desire.
where are you going? We want to trap you first of all.
I'm not the type to be trapped. I'll sit and watch and ensure fair play.
I will check you out.
what style.
professor, my dad used to play the gramophone for us.
do you remember the song? - Thanks child.
brother Prem, should I start?
I'll go and fill the water.
what should I do?
your sister-in-law has taught you to speak in English. Say something.
just a minute.
brother, you're caught.
what should we ask you to do? - I won't do a thing.
this isn't fair. - No way.
all right.
I will say something in your praise.

are you listening, daughter-in-law? - Yes, I am.
the poet has rightly said that nectar is full of goodness.
and that the wife's sister is almost like a wife.
what's this? - He was out but he didn't take it.
are you watching, your honor?
Bhabi ji, no cheating
daddy. 'Moghal-E-Azam'.
who are you watching?. Son-in-law?
dear in-law. Iet us hear.
hey professor, over here.
so, what did Anarkali say to Prince Salim?
your honor, the sunlight brightens up all the gardens of the world.
why then, did The Sun take the trouble?
my dear prince, don't rob the dreams from my eyes.
I'll die!
the time has finally arrived to do something.
one. two.
villagers.
villagers, this Basanti.
I was supposed to get married to her.
but this old auntie. - What did I do?
villagers, if I don't get married, then. suicide.
and then, all of you would be behind bars.
churning the flour mill, churning, churning.
now, please step down.
should I? Villagers, auntie has agreed and so has my Basanti.
so. so. The program of dying is cancelled.
after his excellent show what can I do?
uncle, Michael Jackson
you'll get a slap.
uncle, whatever suits you.
no matter if the world is our enemy.
may this friendship of ours be forever!
we won't separate even in death, we have the promise of friendship.
if someone asks us for our address.
we stay in each other's heart.
we don't have any other place. May this friendship be forever!
it seems to be my turn now.
my blood pressure is going up!
what are you talking, doctor. You're a strong man!
let's hear something out of this world.
what do you mean? - Recite some other poet's poetry.
that would be the worst punishment for a poet.
a poet. I am not.
but, oh my beautiful.
from the time I set my eyes on you.
I got hooked on to poetry!
that was great, doctor.
well, Prem and Nisha only the two of you are left now.
let's see who the winner is.
Bhola, start the music.
thanks a lot.
that's great, you've won. - He has cheated.
what did I do? - What did he do?
he. what do I have to do?
what are you asking her to do?
ask her to tell us some dialogues from a film.
tell her to imitate a song from any film.
why the imitation? Let her do something original.
do it Nisha. It would be fun.
that's something.
o mother, the crow on your roof foretells that.
your darling daughter has renounced this house.
and has fallen in love with a stranger!

and tie the auspicious thread of the ritual.
Bhabhi, we have a complaint.
you were here for so long but never came over to our place.
my dear, when did you call? - You better be quiet.
do we have to invite our own?
you're right. Bhabhi, we promise to come the next time.
shall we go now? It's time for the train to leave.
but my in-law is not to be spotted.
what's the rush? I wanted to bid you'll a proper farewell.
but what about our gift?
dear in-law, this heart is so crazy.
whatever it gets, it always expects more!
the other day, we stopped you all.
now, the heart once again desires to stop you'll for a day.
brother, please do me a favor. I want a photo with Nisha.
that would be a remembrance of her loving stay with us.
sir, one photo for us too. - Me too.
all right. Prem, get the camera.
are you going?
there's no excuse now. So that I can stop you.
can I ask you something? Will you tell me the truth?
what?
why did you stop me yesterday?
I wanted to speak to you on a couple of topics.
immediately after the inauguration of the factory.
I'll speak to Bhabhi about our marriage.
what are you all staring, my dear friends?
our Prem is the big boss today! Salute him.

she has been admitted to a hospital.
they've asked you to come over immediately.
you make the arrangements to leave.
you will get the afternoon bus. I'll make arrangements for you to leave.
who are you giving this cash to?
I'm giving it to Laloo. He'll need it for the treatment.
this is what I feared. I know these servants very well.
this sickness is an excuse to get some cash.
cables like these are available for 5 bucks.
neither will this cash come back nor will he.
it was my duty to caution you. Now it's left to you to decide. Servant!
I swear. This cable is not a fake. It hasn't been bought.
it's a false accusation. It's because I'm a small man!
from when have you become small?
you call me sister-in-law, right?
keep this. - I' m afraid. What if something happens to her?
nothing's going to happen to her. Come with me.
I'm confident that nothing will happen to her.
when she is cured, tell her that you've found yourself a girl.
so, are you leaving? - You come along too.
I'll come over to bring you back.
just a minute. Let us have the tea.
there's no time for tea now. - Give the child to me.
Laloo went yesterday. You will go today. I will be restless.
the work of our factory has started now.
please get my brother-in-law married and get us a companion.
that's great, Sister-in-law.
a Sister-in-law should be like this.
did you see that, Rajesh? What times!
daughter-in-law, it's your responsibility now to find a bride for him.
what's the matter, brother-in-law.
I'm going to my maternal place and you are the one who's excited.
one word about your marriage and the weather seems transformed!
yes Bhabi, I love you
let's talk something serious now.
uncle has given me your responsibility now.
tell me, would you like a love marriage or an arranged marriage?
Bhabhi, a love marriage that you have to arrange. - What?
did you see that son? Your uncle is smarter than your dad is!
he has already found an auntie for you.
even he likes his auntie. He has seen the photo.
what do you say, little one? Say yes.
show me the photo too.
you talk about photo, I'll show you her face itself.
so, is the destination of your love on the way?
it's on the way, Bhabhi, on the way.
my destination has arrived but where's yours?
Bhabhi, the destination of both of us is the same.
come on in.
Bhabhi, have a seat. Think of it as your own home!
what is all this? - You read this first.
mom and dad have gone out. Won't return till evening.

I understand. You and your madam have pre-arranged this program.
what love! Call up your brother at the office.
Why? - Let me give him the good news too.
Bhabhi, where are your feet? - Call up.

tell him to call up Bhabhi as soon as he returns. - Yes.
now, please get up. Put this on Nisha in front of me.
Bhabhi, how can I? Your sister is so shy that she's not coming down.

I' m going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession.
I' m going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession.

sister-in-law gives him her blessings.
the buds of love blossom and we get happiness all the time.
I bless you from the bottom of my heart.
astride a horse, this groom goes to get his bride.
I' m going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession.

brother-in-law and sister-in-law. congratulations.
more than any other ritual in this world.

I come with a thousand dreams.
I'm leaving.
I'm leaving with my brother-in-law's marriage procession.

doctor, she's trying to say something.
quick.
please do something doctor.
what's the matter doctor?
have it Tuffy. The one who used to feed you won't be coming!
she was here only for a few days to distribute her love.
be brave brother.
wonder what magic she had! Without her, we've forgotten to live!
hey brother. Stop.
how are you brother? Take this cash.
brother, a miracle occurred a few days back.
all the doctors had given up. They said that she wouldn't survive.
but I had faith that nothing could happen to her.
after all, my sister-in-law Pooja had prayed for her!
and that's what happened. She opened her eyes and smiled.
I told her that it's because of my sister-in-law's blessings.
I'd like to give this good news to my sister-in-law.
that blessing which was over us has been snatched from us.
big brother, what is this that has happened?
what has happened, big brother?
sir, she gave up her life for the sake of my tears!
she blessed and gave the gift of life to my own sister-in-law.
big brother, do ask God as to why he takes away all the good people.
why does he call them? Ask him, big brother.
Laloo, your sister-in-law Pooja was a goddess of love!
she was so full of love and care!
he is hungry for love too! He needs love too!
the love and care that you talk about.
that was rightfully due to our little one.
what will happen of him now?
big brother, what will happen of our little one now?
big brother, tell me, what will happen of our little one?
go child, go and put him to sleep in his place.
is the child asleep? - He's trying to sleep.
he considers his auntie's lap to be his mothers.
after Pooja's departure, when we miss her so much.
just think of Rajesh's plight.
Rajesh is not very well. He may not say a word.
but we have been observing him for the past few days.
he is mentally disturbed thinking of the welfare of the child.
but doctor, what is the cure? - There is a cure.
brother, we have to set up his life once again.
professor, this is the way of life that can't go unnoticed.
the breath stops but life goes on!
for a child, the shadow of a mother is very important.
I'd say, at an appropriate moment, do speak to Rajesh about it.
please reach me to the dispensary. I'll give Rajesh's medicines too.
so long, professor.
the doctor was absolutely right.
Rajesh, you need not worry about your child.
do heed my advice and remarry.
you haven't aged! You will still get a lot of proposals.
well, my Sweetie is all ready for marriage even today.
if Rajesh had got married to Sweetie.
we would have been spared the agony of this day.
you better be quiet.
Rajesh, my child, I have already spoken to Sweetie.
she has only one condition. The maid will look after the child.
will a maid look after the child? - Yes.
big brother, I beg of you. Don't hand over our little one to such a woman who doesn't know the meaning of the word mother.
you don't interfere. - Laloo is right.
this choice of yours doesn't have the qualities of a mother.
to love somebody else's child, one needs to understand one's customs.
do you understand?
Bhabhi, he is right.
he's talking a lot of rubbish and affronting my niece.
which girl would like to be a step mom?
which parents would hand over her daughter to Rajesh?
forgive me, I'd like to ask you.
will you get your Nisha married to Rajesh?
stop it. That's enough now.
you be quiet. Keep the lectures for your college.
I ask you, what's the harm in the condition laid down by Sweetie?
all this argument for the sake of a mere child.
how does it matter? Children do grow up.
this nature of yours might be responsible for us to be childless.
I don't want a step mom for my son.
all the step moms aren't necessarily bad.
brother! - No, Prem. I won't marry again.
come in professor.
Rajesh isn't ready to marry.
he is right too. How can he hand over his cherished one to a stranger?
Papa, for my son and me, Pooja's thoughts would suffice!
but, someday, you will have to get married.
today, we all are there to take care of the little one.
his grandfather, grandmother. But we won't be there always!
in life, at every step, one needs support.
and then, bringing up a child is a major responsibility.
but chances are that my son might get such a mom who might ignore him in the future.
for him, the mother that would come would be his own.
Kailashnath, what if Nisha comes into this house in place of Pooja?
from the time she's gone from here, she's been talking about this place.
the child too is in her care throughout the day.
get married to Nisha, Rajesh.
in these conditions, if anyone can take the place of his mom, it would be his auntie.
what do you have to say Prem?
please do agree brother. - The child will get a mom.
please ask Nisha first.
I deemed it right and spoke about Nisha to Kailashnath.
if Nisha goes into that house as a daughter-in-law.
and brightens up Pooja's house once again.
I don't think we can ask for any happiness greater than that.
I'll ask Nisha and if she agrees we'll get her married with fanfare.
due to Pooja's absence, we must not be found lacking in any way.
what is your wish, my child?
whatever you'll deem fit.
I'll just call up Kailashnath.
Nisha has agreed.
I'll call up the priest today and find an auspicious date for marriage.
that's true.
it's written in the holy books that life, death and marriage.
humans do not control all these.
welcome Kailashnath. Welcome son.
are you through with the preparations?
Yes, the cards have already been printed.
we'd gone to Ramtekdi for blessings.
thought that we'd meet the little one too.
where is our little one? - He's upstairs in Nisha's room.
child, please go and get the little one. - I'll do that.
how is Nisha? - She's fine. She's applying henna on her hands.
sister, auntie has asked me to bring the little one downstairs.
may I take him? - Yes. Be careful.
just have a look at what I have in my hand. Her wedding card.
please read it.
by the grace of God the marriage of our daughter Nisha has been fixed with Rajesh. You are welcome.
what are you reading? Read properly. - I'm reading properly.
by the grace of God the marriage of our daughter Nisha has been fi Ked with Rajesh. You are welcome to bless the couple.
give it to me. - What happened?
you've done us a big favor by agreeing to get married to Rajesh.
you have given a new lease of life to two people.
you've given them a new life.
see.
what happened? - She was all right just now.
please call some doctor.
she's perfectly all right. I've given her an injection.
she'll be conscious very soon.
doctor, how come, all of a sudden. - It's a matter of marriage.
must have felt giddy due to the exertion.
don't be afraid, professor. I'll take your leave.
thank God. We'll take your leave too.
mummy, I'd like to meet Nisha for once.
come. - Not now. I don't want to disturb her.
please give her this letter.
Nisha, the step that you've taken for the sake of the little one.
I'm grateful to you for that.
everyone is very happy with this decision.
but I know that every girl has her own dreams, her own ambitions.
Nisha, if there is something in your heart, please let me know.
nothing is greater than your happiness.
who?
I will erase the memories of love from my heart.
for the sake of my responsibilities, I will forget everything.
the responsibilities that you have to live up to!
how will I repay you for this favor?
as a mark of respect, I bow in front of you.
as a mark of respect, I bow in front of you.
auntie, let me hold my nephew.
come to your uncle, my dear.
come child.
Oh God, what troubled times are we facing?
prem brother has taken an oath from me not to speak out.
he's made me helpless.
but you aren't helpless. Oh God, work out such a miracle today.
so that your devotees trust you all the more.
Prem, my sister strengthened our love with this necklace.
she wished that her brother-in-law's wife should wear this necklace.
I'm returning it. Nisha.
Tuffy, please do me a favor. Please give this to Prem.
Prem, my sister strengthened our love with this necklace.
she wished that her brother-in-law's wife should wear this necklace.
I'm returning it. Nisha.
what is this Nisha?
did you see Pooja, what the two of them were about to do?
what would I've done? If they had taken this step.
what's the matter Rajesh? Why did you come up all of a sudden?
please read this and tell me if this is justice.
uncle, this cherished one of yours.
one who used to come to me for the smallest of advice!
today, hiding such a momentous thing in his heart.
keeping it behind the fasade of his smile.
he has made me a stranger!
Prem, what you did isn't right.
after Pooja's departure, I had only one wish.
that my child never misses his mother.
I ask of you Nisha, if you had accepted him as an auntie.
would your motherly love have been reduced?
tell me Nisha. Tell me.
why are you quiet Nisha. Answer me.
you fool. Were you out to sacrifice your entire life and happiness?
Rajesh, you should be proud of them.
whatever they did, they did it considering it to be their duty.
I too have a duty now.
Pooja's incomplete dream!
actually, it was my fault.
I couldn't understand what you were trying to tell me. while departing.
Papa, I have a request.
please get Nisha married to Prem.
I might have done some good deeds in my last birth!
I'm blessed by getting such a son-in-law!
we all admire you today!
I'm so full of happiness! What else can my heart ask for?
I've got everything that I could ever ask for!
Subtitels by;Mr. John, resync by: Awela
you can't run from who you are.
no matter how far or how fast you go...
to the ends of the earth and back again...
the shadow of your past is always just one step behind.
I tried to outrun it
changed my name, disappeared,
thought I could leave everything behind.
and here I am, right back in the mess
such is life.
I'll say it again. - Don't.
just go over there and make sure she's alone.
he has some kind of evidence he wants to turn over?
he's got 60 seconds to come out here
and give it to me himself, or I'm gone.
for the record, I told him I think he's doing this for the wrong reasons.
I think it's a bad idea.
don't care. 50 seconds.
you've got no idea what you're into here, do you?
I know you're Frank Murphy,
the Westland gang's chief enforcer
and number eight on the FBI's most wanted.
I know I'm violating six or seven different kinds of professional ethics rules by talking to you,
and I know I'm having serious second thoughts about it.
you're not what I expected.
I get that a lot. 30 seconds.
I'd been working to find and prosecute the remnants of the Westland gang for four years when this C. I. Contacted me, says he could help.
would you like to have a seat?
no, I'm fine. - I'm glad.
you make me a little nervous, you know. Please sit.
looks like someone wants your confidential informant
to keep his evidence to himself.
any idea who the shooters might be?
no. And I have no idea how they knew about the meet.
but whoever they are, they won't going away.
my car was broken into two days ago.
my trash has been torn through. My email has been hacked.
I deal with the worst of the worst In this city.
but this feels different.
you're afraid.
the police detail that's been assigned to me Is watching my back for now.
but I don't want someone who is just going to watch my back.
I want someone who is going to root these people out.
I'd like to introduce you to my security specialist. He's...
he's actually supposed to be here right now, But, um...
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me for just a moment, please? Thank you.
what-- what the-- Why are you？
the client I told you about is downstairs.
the assistant d. A?
Oh, yeah. Okay.
you realize that assistant d. A meet a lot of people who need our kind of help.
I mean, I get that in your world, a guy can take a nap at 2: 00 in the afternoon
and wake up underneath a pile of Chinese food
with a paying client just waiting downstairs.
my world requires a bit more planning, though.
so do you mind coming down And maybe we can close this job?
no worries.
sorry to bother you.
no. This one's mine.
Allyson Russo, this is Christopher Chance, My security specialist.
he's going to be the man on the ground with you.
now be assured there's no one in the world that's better qualified in personal security And threat assessment.
how you doing? - Hello.
now, the way we operate here Is based on The ability to blend in.
we let you appear vulnerable,
use that to our advantage in order to expose the threat.
Why?
why what? - You said he's the best, why?
I'm sorry, this is all a bit new to me.
and you have noodle on your shirt.
that's a bit of a complicated answer, you see-- - So who's your c. I.?
excuse me? - You got hit over a meeting with a c. I. , Who was it?
the "C" stands for confidential.
Oh. Is that what that stands for?
thing is, Less than a week ago, you had guys with assault rifles shooting at you.
they don't seem to be going away. In our business, we refer to that as a...
serious problem.
so you have to ask yourself what's more important to you,
being able to keep a secret or being alive?
why me?
I'm not a cop. I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm just here to identify your problem, solve it,
get you out cleanly with no loose ends.
but I can't do that unless you let me.
the c. I. is Whitey Doyle. - What?
hold on a second. Let me get this straight.
the man who led the Westland gang for 20 years and hasn't been seen in 10.
whitey Doyle, that's your c. I.?
don't ask me why. Maybe he has a guilty conscience,
maybe to settle an old score, maybe he's bored.
I'm not so interested in " Why" As I am "Why you" .
excuse me?
there are 20 other lawyers in your office. Why did he pick you?
because I'm the one going after his old soldiers.
who else is he going to call?
are you going to take my case?
well, between Whitey Doyle and whoever it was that mounted the assault on that bridge,
I think you're pretty much screwed.
of course we're going to take your case.
the last time those guys shot at you was your first meeting with Whitey Doyle.
the best way to lure them out is to arrange a second one.
this is your plan? - Yeah.
to paint a bull's-eye on my back And see who takes a shot at me?
at us. Well, hopefully more me than you.
a lot of people survive your plans, do they?
Oh, you'd be surprised.
look, I'm going to go in there,
tell them about the meet, and establish my cover.
from then on, I promise, I won't leave your side.
okay. Any way you can try and keep it cool in there?
Hey. It's going to be fine. Trust me.
good morning. Mark nelson, attorney for Wette Doyle.
are you Allyson Russo? - Yes.
Mr. Doyle would like to see you again.
so your client's a fugitive, But you're here to dictate the terms.
Yep. Term number one, all meetings happen At a place of my client's choosing.
term number two, full blanket immunity From prosecution.
and most importantly, number three, My client will deal with Ms. Russo And Ms. Russo only.
Mr. Nelson, why don't we discuss this privately?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Where do you get off?
I'm Allyson's supervise.
I will take part in any meeting with Doyle regarding he doesn't like you.
excuse me? - You're excused.
this office has been full of leaks for as long as you've been here.
he sees it as evidence of a character defect.
even if I agree to the demands, - The immunity deal will never hold up. - Sure, it will.
okay, why don't you just let me talk to him?
I can talk to him and get to the bottom of this. - No, hold on, hold on.
because I want to hear how Mr. Nelson thinks
he's going to get a judge to let one of the most wanted men In America off the hook in return for some vague promise of his testimony.
please. Educate me.
let's just-- - Todd vs. California
state Supremes upheld Blanket immunity for a notorious gang boss in exchange for the promise of testimony.
u. S. Vs. VAZQUEZ-- Similar situation with a drug-trafficking kingpin.
judge cone upstairs,
lead PROSECUTOR, CALIFORNIA vs. LEE-- Same deal.
but I'm sure this can't be a surprise to you.
or can it?
maybe that's why they keep passing you over for Kent's job down the hall.
okay. - Okay, okay, okay.
let's all just take a little breather here.
why don't we let these two talk this through, huh? Huh?
okay, so you are not a lawyer, correct?
not that I'm aware of.
then how did you know all that?
the legal stuff? I just made it up.
no. No, you didn't. Harris might not do his homework, but I do.
and those cases were dead on.
Really?
fine, but you have no idea how many people in this building Are going to be talking about this.
the building? I want everyone in the city talking about this.
we enforced our requirements, Force the bad guys to make a mistake.
Yeah. What'd you find?
Really? You sure, Winston?
okay, I'll check it out.
what was that?
when you hired us, I knew something wasn't right.
it seemed like a slam dunk. There was a leak in your office
somebody you were covering for, someone with some dirt in their past.
well, I was right. There is somebody with dirt in their folder,
but the thing is, it's you.
five years ago, your first major racketeering case, $50, 000 shows up in your checking account.
internal affairs steps in to investigate. Eventually they drop the case.
a little weird, huh?
I'm not on the take-- not now, not ever.
I don't think you are on the take. You don't seem like the type. But that's a lot of money.
is there anything you're not telling me?
I think I answered your question.
I want to get you moving, see who follows,
try to get the bad guys to make a move.
we called ahead, Got you a table where you two will be able to talk privately.
we'll do a quick sweep of the restaurant when we arrive.
should only take a minute or two.
sorry for the inconvenience.
inspector Gibson, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate everything you guys are doing.
Ah. Just doing our job.
Oh, there is one thing I wanted to mention About this morning, though I know it's probably not my place,
but, um, doesn't really sound like a good idea For you to meet with Doyle alone again.
no, it doesn't really sound like a good idea, Does it?
but there's too much at stake with this case.
and if meeting him can crack it, then it's worth the risk.
all right. Just saying, if we had been there the first time,
this problem would be over by now.
3 William 56, report. - Hey, you mind grabbing that?
3 William 56, en route to Matthew's grille with the package plus one.
Roger that.
I'm sorry, what did you mean by that? - Excuse me?
you said that if you'd been there, This would be over by now.
what did-- what did you mean?
well, we could've surveyed the meet
and, uh, made a move on the gunmen showed themselves.
Oh, I see. You could've kept eyes on the bridge,
made sure that it was clear.
exactly.
you didn't mention that the meet took place on a bridge - In your official report, did you? - No.
Yeah, well, it seems to me like inspector Gibson already knew.
did it seem that way to you?
Wow. This is awkward.
wait a minute.
you two were the gunmen on the bridge
that were trying to kill Whitey Doyle and Allyson. Right?
okay, now this is awkward.
looks like we figured out who's trying to kill you.
I don't understand. Why is this happening?
are you okay? - Am I okay?
police officers, whom I have spent my entire Professional life trying to defend, are trying to kill me.
Why? Why? We don't know. We don't know.
I'm being protected by a guy
who just strangled someone with a seat belt
and then threw him from a moving car.
and--and you're now in the process of trying to steal another car.
so you tell me-- am I okay?
you're fine.
I'm going to call my office, and they can put an end to this.
this is Allyson. - Put the phone down.
we need to go right now. Give it to me. Get in the car.
how did you know they were coming?
they're tracking me?
using you to get to whitey-- not a bad plan,
except for the part where you found out about them.
now Gibson has to kill you too.
how are they tracking me, my phone?
that's a good place to start.
let's start removing pieces of the equation until we can nail it down.
what are you doing? - Well, you told me to get rid of it.
I said remove it from the tracker, not throw it out the window.
guess it wasn't the phone. - Guess not.
next step, take your clothes off. - Excuse me?
clothes off now. There's a tracker on you somewhere.
we're never going to lose these guys unless we find it.
you're kidding me.
I'm really not.
call my office.
Yeah, five cops tried to kill you. I'm not sure who we can trust there.
Yeah, listen, it's me. I've got another development.
the gunmen on the bridge, they were cops.
they blew their chance at whitey,
but they got themselves assigned to her security detail after the fact.
I got names and badge numbers,
including an inspector named was Gibson.
only five cops probably isn't just five.
there's a good chance there's more iceberg there.
you still got that buddy in I. A?
Yeah, I'll call him right now.
why don't they use their sirens?
well, why make a scene when he's got the tracker?
Gibson knows he won't lose us. He knows we can't run forever.
he can just hang back, wait for us to stop, and then they got .
eyes forward, please.
Oh, this is bad.
the tracker's still pointing at me.
I was afraid of that.
that means the tracker's not on you, it's in you.
in--in me? That sounds like a problem.
Yeah, it does. Look, I know somebody who can help us.
we just need to stall for a little bit of time.
what are you doing? - I'd suggest a seat belt.
I don't like this plan. I really don't.
we haven't even gotten to the good part yet.
not bad. - It's not my first time.
could you put some clothes on? It's distracting.
Hey, dude. - Hey.
thanks for dropping everything to help us.
you caught me at a good time. Just finished shampooing out the trunk of my car.
so somebody's tracking you?
why isn't she naked yet?
we tried that already.
interesting. - And who are you?
uh, Allyson, Guerrero. Guerrero, Allyson.
nice to meet you.
all right, let's get to work.
al, hey.
how are you doing, man?
good to see you. Thanks for coming down to see me so quickly.
so what's so important you couldn't talk about it over the phone?
Oh, my client's kind of in the thick of it right now.
she got a couple dirty cops on her tail.
I'm just trying to figure out how deep the whole thing goes.
sure thing. Just give me a name, and I can get into it.
who's your client? - An A.D.A., Russo.
she contacted Whitey Doyle, had him ready to talk.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
well, wait, what do you mean you can't, ah? This is your job.
don't tell me how to do my job, you of all people.
what are you afraid of, man?
Doyle had his fingers in every corner of city hall
cops, D.As, judges.
he had people on his payroll at every level,
among them, a handful of cops that carried out the real rough stuff
witness intimidation, assassination.
Wes Gibson was the head of that crew.
okay, then. Help me take him down.
you can't. He's a star inside the department.
his history with Doyle is common knowledge in the I. A.
but the rank and file, they don't want to believe it,
or their names are in whitey's ledger too.
so what am I supposed to do now-- Just cut this woman loose?
not for nothing...
but we're pretty sure her name's in whitey's ledger as well.
you know about the investigation we ran,
those deposits showing up in her accounts.
hold on. "Deposits"? Plural?
someone dropped thousands a half a dozen times into her accounts just after she became a D.A.
tell her to turn herself in, hope for the best.
if she does that and the wrong cop gets ahold of her,
she'll be dead before she hits the station. Come on, Al.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand how they could have implanted a tracker.
I haven't been to the doctor in months, and even then,
it's just routine exams because I hate...needles.
what the hell is that?
Oh, come on, man can you put that stuff away?
what? If it's just under the skin, I can go in and get it.
no, no. No, no, no, no. No one's going in and getting anything.
you tell him nobody's going in to get anything.
Guerrero, let's find out what we're dealing with before the knives come out.
all right. Extremities tend to be the easiest place to sneak these things in,
but quick pinprick, that thing goes right in.
and I'm telling you, I haven't been around any needles.
that's what they all say.
Oh, dude.
think we got our device.
ingested? - Certainly looks that way.
they fed it to me? - Yep.
good ones are, like, the size of a grain of rice.
stays in your system for about a week or so.
can we remove it? - Uh, surgically.
we don't have that kind of time.
how are we going to get away from them - If they know how to find me all the time? - We can't.
we can if we pull over and let her out.
not helpful. All right, just let me out.
I know a guy. He might know how to jam the signal.
call me as soon as you find anything. - All right, buddy. Nice to meet you.
tell me some good news, please.
Nope. Apparently city government is filled up with people who'd love nothing more Than to see Allyson disappear today.
whitey Doyle had dozens of them on his payroll,
and they have a lot to lose If that ledger of his ever comes to light.
great, so I just need to get my hands on whitey's ledger Before Gibson does, or this never ends.
well, our current situation isn't going to make it any easier to get Doyle to show his face.
Oh, and, um, just to add insult to injury,
apparently I had it wrong about the investigation into her finances.
it wasn't just one incident. It was a half dozen.
I. A. just rolled them up into one case.
somebody tried to put money Into her account six times And she kept returning it?
that's what I'm hearing.
let me call you back.
we've got a new destination. We're going to see Whitey Doyle.
in the middle of all this? He'd never agree to it.
maybe not for most people, But for you, I think he'd make an exception.
what are you talking about?
if somebody tries to put money in your account once, I'd say it's a bribe.
six times, that's something else.
you sleeping with him? - Just leave it alone.
leave it alone? I can't leave it alone.
I need to find this guy today. We need that ledger.
and there's something you're not telling me.
it doesn't matter. He's never going to come out of hiding.
it doesn't matter. What doesn't matter?
do you have pictures of him? He has pictures of you?
what makes him want to pay you off, come out of hiding after ten years?
he's my father.
whitey Doyle is your father? - Yes, sort of.
Oh, sort of is an option?
uh, there's no official record of it. He split when I was two.
I barely remember him.
I woke up one morning. My mom was crying. Never saw him again.
when he left, we moved, And my mom and I never talked about it again.
it was a secret, but it was always there.
well, you're going to see him again today.
we can't. - Why not?
because we'll lead Gibson right to him.
no matter how long we run, they're always going to be One step behind us.
the only way to end this thing for good
is to get some evidence on Gibson and his men
whitey's evidence.
I can't get to him directly.
what did you do last time?
Frank Murphy-- he reached out to me.
but after he was shot at the bridge, I did some digging,
and there's a doctor at St. Paul's Who handles things quietly for whitey and his people.
maybe Frank's there.
the Parisian hotel Is about two blocks east, right?
Yeah, why? - If we get a taxi, we can get to St. Paul's quicker.
what's wrong with this car? - Nothing, but we need to buy some time.
let's go.
yeah? - You were wrong.
about what? - She's Doyle's kid, Al.
look, this isn't some crooked a. D.A. getting what's coming to her.
this is a good woman who's trying to do her job,
and she needs your help.
al, you remember when I left the force
I said I wanted to be free to do what was right,
with no b. S.no egos in the way?
you remember what you said to me?
you said one day you'd join me. I'm thinking today's that day.
where is she now?
she's on her way to St. Paul's hospital To pick up Whitey Doyle's ledger.
she needs to get to the courthouse.
I'll call Pamela Heard.
if there's one judge in this city that's not tangled up in this mess, it's her.
I'll take my best men and meet her.
make sure she gets to the judge safely.
so what's the deal with the money?
around the time I became a D. A. my mom got lymphoma.
the bills piled up.
and just before it got really bad, - 50 grand turned up in my checking account. - Whitey put it there.
and I returned it every time. I reported it as bank errors.
Why? - Because the hell with him.
he's a bad guy,
a guy I don't want or need anything from.
I sold everything I owned. I went into debt.
and I just barely managed to cover her expenses.
in less than 48 hours, you got me talking About the one thing
I haven't talked to anyone about In my entire life.
saw your underpants too.
you spent your entire professional life
trying to put people like your father behind bars.
you lied about your past, where you came from.
maybe it's okay to talk about it now.
maybe it's okay to stop running away from who you are.
so far today, you hijacked a moving car,
you nearly caused a catastrophic traffic accident,
and you picked a fight with a city Full of angry, desperate cops.
something tells me you're just getting started.
what's your point?
what are you running from?
it's going to be coming up on the right. We'll get off right up front.
how long till they're on to us?
tracker shows location, not altitude. They'll probably search floor to floor
two to four minutes each.
let's hope Murphy has a good view.
here to see Omar.
Hey, dude. Need some help.
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
this is time-sensitive. I need you now.
Yoh, wait your turn, man.
this'll only take a minute. - You better wait like I told you to
there's 600 amps running through this thing,
so unless you want it running through you too, - I'd watch the sudden movements. - Thank you.
listen, dude, What do you know about micro-gaps chips small enough to ingest without knowing it?
I warned you.
now shut up and let the man finish what he's doing
Really? What is the matter with you?
he'll be fine. Listen, a friend of mine's been tagged.
I need to know how to help her disable it, fast.
fast? - Fast. - Cut it out.
not an option. What else?
I don't know, uh... Wait for it to die on its own,
hide her inside a microwave oven, Send her to the moon.
but as long as that thing is working and she's on planet earth, satellite's going to see her.
why a microwave oven?
St
there are over 200 rooms in this place. He's under an alias.
you took one look at the patient roster, And you think you found him?
room 819, 62-year-old Caucasian male with a perforated abdominal tumor.
the surgery uses the same anesthesia and instruments As a gunshot to the stomach.
now, if I was a doctor and I wanted to keep things quiet,
that's exactly the cover that I would use.
but you're not a doctor. - No.
you aren't done enough already? You're back for more?
the men who shot at us on the bridge were cops...
crooked cops trying to stop whitey from turning over evidence of their corruption, and they're on their way up here right now.
you brought them here? - They tracked me here.
but I don't have to be here when they find me.
tell me how to find whitey.
tell me how to get my hands on that evidence, And I'm out of here.
about four minutes, they're coming through that door.
what if whitey won't help?
you have kids? - No.
I've heard you get pretty attached to them.
he's your father. He'll help.
she said she had nothing to do With the bridge.
give me that phone. You listen to me.
as far as I'm concerned, you are nothing but a criminal who's never had to answer for a single thing he's done.
is there a chance you get burned by helping me? Absolutely.
do I care? No.
you owe me For what you did. You owe me.
all I'm asking you to do is messenger the ledger over to the courthouse.
are you going to do it or not?
here, he wants to talk to you.
yeah?
where do you want the ledger sent?
the courthouse-- my office.
let's get you out of here.
give me whatever you got.
there's a good chance I wasn't walking out of this place, anyway.
I spent 30 years willing to take a bullet to protect the Doyle family.
like it or not, that's you too.
Hey, pal.
I thought I said nobody gets in!
good to see you, detective,
especially under the circumstances.
the evidence of your involvement with Whitey Doyle is on its way to the courthouse as we speak.
and there's no explaining this away.
we're here to take you in.
do you have any idea how many good people stand to be hurt If that ledger comes to light?
the people whose names are in that book Have a debt to pay.
and I don't care how many of them there are.
maybe you should.
so I should get used to seeing you around here, shouldn't I?
that's what I'd do. - Rvelous. What are you doing?
trying to figure out this tracker.
thing about these implants, They're just basically very weak microwave transmitters,
so implant puts out a signal, and this reader tracks it.
so if the little implant is close enough
to a much more powerful microwave source of the same frequency, then
it gets lost. - Exactly.
well, that's good for Allyson.
but how do we find a source with the right frequency?
turns out that might be easier than you think.
can you give me a straight
I can't believe he did that for me. I didn't even know him.
I don't think he did it for you.
I mean, after 30 years, I imagine whitey Was the closest thinning he had to family.
Murphy did it for him.
you know what? Let's not do this like family means anything to them.
whitey walked out on his actual family and never looked back.
maybe. Maybe he knew that sometimes the only way to keep the people you love safe is to walk away.
why are you defending him?
I don't know.
maybe I can appreciate his dilemma.
where are you?
en route to the courthouse, about five minutes away.
I need you to turn around.
what? The ledger's there. The judge is waiting for us.
your I. A. Buddy's going to escort us in.
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
went to the hospital to meet you. Gibson got to him.
they're going to pin the murder on Allyson.
look, they have cleared the area around the courthouse.
the place is going to be surrounded with cops.
they'll have an excuse to shoot first and ask questions later.
you're not going to get in the front door.
how's Guerrier coming with the tracker?
he's working on something. You want what he's got?
Yeah. Give me a minute.
maybe this was a bad idea.
maybe we should just turn around and keep running until we can find a safer option.
there are going to be cops all over town Gunning for you.
how far do you want to run?
what's the plan?
please tell me it doesn't involve driving the ambulance
right through the front doors of the building.
you ever try that?
trust me, it's not something you want to do twice.
put Guerrero on.
ambulance reported stolen. It's headed your way. Do you have a visual?
Yeah, I got it now.
if it fails cooperate you're clear to fire.
Hey, guys.
don't let that ambulance through.
look at that. The decoy worked.
I won't know who to trust in there.
trust me.
you ready? - Yeah.
I'm Allyson Russo. I'm here to see judge Heard.
we'll get her out quietly. Deal with it downstairs.
go.
bet you didn't know those things could broadcast the same signal They're programmed to receive,
even drown out weaker versions of the same signal.
tough break for you.
there's proof of all of this - a ledger of Doyle's payouts.
if you could have someone escort me to my office, It should be there.
there's no evidence in your office.
your evidence walked into my office about 20 minutes ago.
Hello, Allyson.
I brought the ledger...
corroborated everything with the judge here.
I think your problems are over.
they're going to put you in jail.
why are you doing this?
my little girl was in danger.
I'm everything you think I am
a crook, a thief, a thug.
there's never been any accounting for any of it.
and it occurred to me that, uh...
until that happens, there's one thing I can never be.
I'm 66 years old.
I- I don't know how many more kicks at the can I'm going to have.
it's time.
it's for you.
Hello?
so I guess you can stop running now.
Yeah, I guess so.
will you?
Wow. Things must be awfully interesting in your office these days.
over 60 indictments from whitey's testimony and ledger,
including Gibson and his crew.
they still haven't found him yet, huh?
no, nobody knows where he is.
there's a warrant out for his arrest,
but he could be halfway around the world by now.
Bye, dude.
what exactly is his story?
I honestly couldn't tell you.
so what do I owe you?
Oh, don't worry about that. It's been taken care of.
what? By who? No, no. No, I can't.
Oh, sure you can.
it's the least a man can do for his daughter.
besides, it'd be nice To have a friend down at city hall
we can talk to from time to time.
everybody we know down there is about to go to jail, so...
what's the matter?
Gibson is still out there.
afraid he's going to come after you for retribution?
I'm worried that this isn't over.
Delmar
there's something you ought to know about my associate.
he doesn't like loose ends
can you explain something to me about your associate?
he's not a lawyer, he's not a doctor,
and he's certainly not a cop.
what the hell is he?
you can't run from who you are.
you can't run from me.
they seem to have lost all interest.
can't say I blame them.
good to see you old friend.
me too.
you're Mark Wareham. You sit on the board of her foundation.
visiting before she heads off to the Museum for tonight event.
it's a four minute walk to the suite.
stairwell.
twenty meters out. North facing.
you'll be searched in the foyer.
I have a spare weapon on my left ankle, should it come to that.
is there anyone on our detail we can trust?
not a soul.
Thanks.
identification please.
thank you, sir. Cheers.
the last 48 hours have been particularly harrowing, so perhaps a modicum of formality might help keep her relaxed.
sure.
isn't it formality that's got us in this mess in the first place?
christopher Chance, I give you her royal highness, Victoria, Princess of Wales.
Oh, please, don't do that.
Oh, sure. Nice to meet you.
has he been briefed?
what I know is that in an hour and a half, your security detail's gonna put you in a car which is gonna bring you to a museum uptown to meet the Queen, your husband, Prince what's his name, and the rest of the gang.
at 38th and 1st, your motorcade is gonna be obstructed.
now usual security protocol is to go faster, maybe even turn around, do anything to avoid being boxed in.
but in this particular instance, your detail has different orders.
they're there to serve you up.
so while you're stopped, your men watching...
you'll be assassinated.
luckily, Gerard got wind of the plot while we still have me to do something about it.
lucky? Is that the word you'd use?
well, we're lowering the bar today.
so we have the who, the what, the where, all we need is a why.
because I'm in love with a man who isn't my husband.
that generally will do it.
well, Victoria told Walter she wanted a divorce, but he's a proud man.
facing international embarrassment, we feel he sought out a sympathetic ear to help him avoid it.
unfortunately, the one he found belongs to a man of the lowest moral character.
he's special envoy to the crown.
the royal fixer, in other words.
charged with keeping the family's dirty laundry off the front page of the Sun.
no doubt he's convinced his conspirators that removing the spoiled, reckless heir from the equation is what's best for everyone.
well, being the black sheep in this family must not be easy.
what about the Queen?
the Queen's been in transit from Sydney, along with my sister, since Gerard first discovered the plot.
Templeton's rather adept at keeping her majesty insulated, if you know what I mean.
tell me, do you think I'm crazy for throwing away everything for a man I met just a month ago?
what's his name?
how do you know you're in love with him?
right answer.
so let's see if we can get her out of this mess.
...for a glimpse of her royal highness,
princess Victoria, who is expected to meet the rest of her family at the gala opening of the Queen's collection.
so you'll be with her in the car.
from what I've learned of the plot, the attack will occur here.
then I take control of the car, divert it to the safe house.
and by then, I'll have retrieved evidence of the plot from my contact.
evidence? What evidence?
audiotapes of her head of security and Templeton discussing the plot in detail.
the tape is vital, and once I have it, we'll take it to the Queen, cut Templeton off at the knees.
and what about Tony?
I mean, he's in as much danger as I am.
Oh, Tony's gonna be fine.
I've got my best guys scooping him up.
you're gonna want to take a left up here in two blocks to get to the 59th street bridge.
no.
directions are now being sent to your vehicle.
left.
not gonna happen. Dude.
I don't do anything until the lady tells me to.
in a quarter mile, turn left onto 28th street.
you actually trust the word of some broad that lives in the dash of your Camaro over mine?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I lived in this city for eight years, dude.
there's certain things you just don't do here, like question a New Yorker when he's giving you directions.
don't use crosswalks.
don't eat pizza with a fork and a knife.
yeah?
what's the holdup?
I gave you the address about half an hour ago.
well, there's a bit of a disagreement over the best way to get to where Tony's holed up.
okay, spare me the play-by-play.
just find the guy and let me know when you got him, okay?
Yeah.
turn right up here.
in a quarter mile, turn right.
good.
is she still with her guests?
Yes.
thought you should be informed that Gerard and his guests are still with the Princess.
you checked the man's I. D?
I did. Everything checked out.
but you're suspicious, nonetheless.
I am.
there's no reason to doubt your instinct.
perhaps we should move the timetable up.
shouldn't you run that by the Prince?
I think the Prince would gladly delegate that decision.
are we clear, Nathan?
Yes, sir.
what is it?
construction is causing backups all around the hotel.
Nathan wants to get ahead of the traffic.
the motorcade's preparing to leave as we speak.
but it's an hour early. I'm not ready yet.
I'm sorry, your highness.
I'm afraid Templeton insists on it.
sir, if you could come with me, I'll escort you out.
that won't be necessary, really.
no, it's no problem. I'll just meet you downstairs.
we've got less time than we thought.
open the door, please.
a lot less.
James, respond please.
open the door.
Nathan's getting impatient.
what do you think? Looks big enough?
it will have to do.
what?
excuse me.
where are you going?
they put scallions in the Princess's soup.
get the lift for me.
I must have told them three times she is allergic.
I am going to have a private word with that chef, let him know he very nearly sent the Princess of Wales into anaphylactic shock!
your majesty?
the cart!
come to lobby. Stop Gerard.
I'm coming down there.
what's this about?
get downstairs right now!
all stations, lockdown!
sparrow is on the loose.
be honest.
how certain were you that would work?
about 50/50.
how far up are they?
about four or five floors.
okay.
Gerard! -Get down! Get down!
go with him.
no. We're going to get you help.
down!
Gerard, we need the evidence.
Belfast. Remember the man we hunted together?
Really?
he's here in New York Mac Gowan's Pub.
go. You're clear.
it's been an honor, your highness.
go, go, go, go!
are you Tony Sorrento?
relax. I'm Winston.
gerard sent us to pick you up.
Victoria's okay?
she will be.
we're here to make sure you are too.
I'll be fine. It's my Uncle's garage.
nobody knows I'm here.
Victoria's got low blood sugar.
I wanted to grab something just in case we're hiding out for a while.
well, we're not gonna meet her just yet.
dude.
get inside, get inside.
I think they know you're here, dude.
stay here.
listen, just head downtown, will you?
see, guys like Gerard, they don't mind taking a bullet.
not if it's the right person.
I know, I know. He took an oath.
he fulfilled his duty to the crown.
do me a favor. Slump down, will you?
I don't want anyone spotting you.
what is it?
the Princess is out of pocket.
how long?
two minutes. We'll get her back.
but Gerard is dead, along with some of the detail.
that woman is next in line to the throne, and every day, she finds a new way to heap shame upon her family and our country.
and now she proposes to add to that with an international scandal to service a cheap fling.
she is a threat to everything we swore to protect.
can I count on you, Mr. Nathan?
Yes, sir.
come here.
check the call log.
let's find out who he's been talking to.
if this traffic doesn't let up, we're gonna have to get out and hoof it.
so where exactly are we going for this evidence?
gerard said something about a man from Belfast.
Yeah, yeah.
you know this person?
uh, I know of him.
okay, trust me.
given the events of today, there isn't a name you could offer me that would shock me.
that's not funny.
ex-ira enforcer?
sworn enemy of the crown?
gerard didn't know who he could trust in his own security detail, so he went to an outside party.
an outside party? -It kind of makes sense.
but the man put a bounty on my head!
that's just a rumor.
it was on the front page of the telegraph--£100, 000.
I was eight!
Really?
well, anyway, he and Gerard must have come to some sort of understanding.
I think you're gonna be fine.
Victoria, look at me.
who else am I going to look at?
don't turn your head away.
Why?
Hey, Victoria! Victoria!
hurry. Run!
don't make eye contact.
we're going straight to the back.
isn't this a bit extreme?
well, right now, you've got everybody in the city looking for you.
I don't think you'd be able to go four feet let alone 40 blocks looking like the Princess of Wales.
well, just so you know, someone usually gets paid £1, 500
to give me a new hairstyle, let alone change my whole wardrobe.
well, I'm sure they're much better at it than me.
I'm telling you, he's gonna die.
I'm an EMT. I can help him.
Hey, hey, hey, hey! What's the matter with you?
that three feet of garage right there is a kill zone.
I can reach him. It'll take two seconds.
Hey, listen, Tony.
I'm gonna spoil the ending of this little adventure you're on.
that shooter out there is a pro, so two seconds is about four times longer than he's gonna need.
now the Princess of Wales hired me to bring you back safely, so hurt bad guy or no hurt bad guy, stay here.
Hey, "kill zone," take a look at this.
that's clever.
you know, how you take the last thing that I said and turn it into my nickname or something?
Yeah, that's clever.
what do you think? Rotor?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's kind of corroded. I don't know.
maybe ought to clean that up, we could get it started.
but if we're in this car and it stalls ten feet outside of the garage, we're sitting ducks.
we're already sitting duck yeah.
get out of there!
wow, that was stupid.
don't do that again! -I'm sorry.
looks like the bullet went right through the front of his vest.
fortunately for you, it didn't go through the back.
it looks like I'll be able to stop the bleeding.
Yeah, now we're talking.
if I can get a bead on the sniper,
I can take a shot at him.
we just gotta draw him out.
I think I got an idea.
so what exactly do they call this look?
a technical term would be "bridge and tunnel.
it's not gonna work.
you can still see my face.
uh, trust me, no one's looking at your face.
Hey! Open up!
this ain't a motel.
you take it someplace else next time, will you?
Yeah. It won't happen again.
I beg your pardon! Come on, come on.
I wasn't aware that fornicating in convenience store bathrooms was common practice.
welcome to New York.
are you all right?
I'm mildly hypoglycemic.
um, the stress isn't helping.
why don't you tell me about Tony?
Why?
he was volunteering at a blood drive sponsored by one of my charities.
he offered to take my blood, not knowing it was strictly forbidden.
my mother was horrified.
I did it anyway.
you see, the thing you must understand about my marriage to Walter is that it was negotiated.
in three years we've been together, we've never experienced one true moment of happiness.
but people told me it made sense, so I believed them.
until Tony.
in ten minutes, I knew what I'd been missing.
and I knew I could never go back, even if it meant turning my world upside down and having everyone I know think that I was crazy.
well, it's easy for them to think you're crazy.
they've never had what you and Tony have.
it sounds like perhaps you have.
well, she must be an amazing woman.
Yeah.
I heard the news reporting she was spotted on the street.
you told me your men could handle this.
my men are not my concern.
you, on the other hand, seem to have mistaken your role in these things,
prince Walter.
if this turns sour, I won't be the one twisting in the wind for it.
you remember my name and that you work for me.
I work for the crown, your highness.
I was here before you.
and if you do not pull yourself together,
I will be here long after you as well.
what is it?
we get to Mac Gowan's, and this will all be over very soon.
what can I get you?
uh, a couple of pints.
couple of pints it is, then.
say, I'm looking for a guy named Connor Dunham.
he's probably a regular.
Oh, Connor comes by quite frequently.
he'll want to know who's asking.
tell him it's a friend of Gerard's.
you might want to say it's urgent.
and how would Connor know him?
it's a funny story, actually.
love your earrings.
Thanks.
love your accent too.
how about that new Yankee Stadium?
you been there?
no, not yet.
um, I'm more of a symphony person.
I love the symphony.
you know, I'm getting the feeling that whatever I say, you'll say you love it.
I love how you put that just now.
Hey, buddy, she's spoken for.
what do you think?
get the back room ready.
still no word from Tony?
no, not yet, but I'm sure he's gonna be fine.
whoa, slow down, your highness.
I'm loose in New York City dressed like a harlot, the love of my life is nowhere to be found, and I'm actively seeking the help of a man who spent the best part of the '80s intent upon killing me.
given all that, I feel entitled to a drink.
well, I can't argue with that.
this guy's good.
still no sign of him.
so what? He just waits up there forever?
or until he calls in reinforcements to storm the place.
I imagine that's not far off.
all right, dude, gotta ask you.
you're an EMT, dude.
median income at best.
you're not in a band, yet you land a Princess?
how'd you open?
open?
Yeah, you know, with the Princess.
how'd you open?
I don't know, man. It's all a fog.
all a fog?
standing in front of me was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
talking with the sweetest voice I'd ever heard.
her arm in my hand and it feels like...
I don't know.
blood rushing to my head, making this rumbling sound.
have you ever had that happen to you where you're
all right, enough.
not the answer I was looking for.
whoa, what's this?
that's interesting.
look at this.
industrial-strength anesthetic.
why would he have a syringe full of anesthetic in his jacket if he was just supposed to kill me?
cause he wasn't supposed to kill you.
looks like the plan was to abduct you.
abduct me?
what the hell would they want to abduct me for?
you know, I look at Tony, and he wants to help a person in need, he does it.
it doesn't require three years of committee hearings and a royal proclamation.
and all this because I seek something more than a life spent riding mares, attending dinner parties, fencing lessons.
I ask you, honestly, on my deathbed, how likely is it
I will close my eyes and go to my final rest, thinking, well, thank God I made the time to become a competent fencer.
uh, not very likely.
why don't you just leave?
hmm? I'm sorry?
well, you're not happy.
you don't really see the point.
so why don't you just leave, like...... what's his name?
edward something.
you're talking abdication.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm heir apparent to the throne.
abdication requires consent from parliament in all 16 commonwealths.
there's Canada, Australia...
16. Take my word for it.
besides, my mother would never consent to it.
nor will she ever let me be with Tony.
well, here's how I see things.
you strip away the traditions and the titles and the scheming, vengeful husbands,
I think what you're dealing with here is a typical mother-daughter situation.
I mean, unless Tony has three arms,
I think your mother's gonna come around.
it's important to you that Tony and I get through this.
Hey, you guys, you want to see Connor, follow me.
so I guess you're Connor.
well, ain't you a good guesser.
Where's Gerard?
Gerard's dead.
well, you're about to join him.
you know, Gerard hired me 'cause he couldn't trust anyone in that snake pit of a family.
and then yours walk in, throwing his name around.
and I'm supposed to swallow that wholesale?
now we got a name for that back home, don't we?
it's called a setup.
this isn't a setup. We're friends of Gerard's.
well, you better offer me some proof of that.
gerard was more than a friend.
he was like a father to me.
the most decent man I've ever known.
and the fact that he saw fit to trust you is the only reason I haven't taken that gun and emptied it into your ruddy Irish face.
well, that just about says it, eh, Connor?
sorry for trying to kill you all them years.
apology accepted.
you got it?
we're good.
this better work, dude.
we've only got one shot at drawing him out.
Hey, dude.
somebody else needs to drive.
cool.
there's a GPS under the dash.
you can input the address to where we're going.
great.
you're stable. This will help with the pain.
you might drift in and out, but nothing to worry about.
I was only following orders.
I'm sorry.
over there.
in the back.
what's that?
it's my handwriting.
I wrote these letters. To who?
to Victoria.
why do these guys have them?
this here is a key conversation.
here, let's pull it up.
will divert sparrow en route to the museum.
that's Nathan, and "sparrow" is the details code name for me.
I'm concerned about the attack en route.
and that's Templeton.
why all the interference?
it was windy last night, wasn't it?
I put it all through a background noise filter.
this is the best we're gonna get.
stalker's the threat. Stalker is the threat.
you had a stalker?
sure, several. Why?
sounds like they're discussing legitimate security concerns.
this is hardly proof of a conspiracy.
is this all you got?
Oh, no, there's more.
this is all I had time to process.
how much more?
about two hours.
and I've only been able to put about 30 minutes through the filter.
I warned Gerard this would take time.
well, time is something we're kinda short on right now.
are you in there, Connor?
Yeah, Francis.
give us a tick, will you?
something wrong?
two knocks.
trouble.
and Francis has our guns.
come on, Connor, open up.
bust it in.
top of the morning.
well, there goes our evidence.
can't your read? Employees only.
Winston, tell me some good news.
well, we got Tony. Headed back to the city now.
how are things on your end?
Tony's okay.
Gerard's dead.
all that's left of his evidence is one tape, and it's awfully sketchy.
what, and you don't think it's good enough?
we got something here you might find interesting.
I'm not quite sure what to make of it yet.
one of our bad guys had a bunch of letters with him, letters Tony wrote to the Princess.
they planted them in his ambulance.
love letters?
Oh, yeah.
they just weren't gonna kill Tony.
they were gonna use him as a patsy.
they grab him just before the Princess leaves for the museum.
use his ambulance to block the motorcade.
once the Princess was stopped, he'd lure her out of the car, out from behind the bulletproof glass.
let me go!
Gerard, no!
out of the car now!
no, get in the car!
No! Ah!
it explains why they wanted to keep Tony alive
plant the murder weapon in his hand.
all these love letters in the ambulance make him look like a stalker.
everything's all wrapped up in a bow for the front page.
listen, Winston, we need those letters to corroborate Gerard's tape.
I mean, separately, they're nothing, but together, they link Templeton to the plot.
you hear that?
you should be on your way.
you know what I'm thinking?
Yeah, that we all gotta get to the Queen together.
we all need to get to the Queen together.
we're on the way.
all right. Come on.
we're gonna make a visit to the museum.
but how will we get in?
I mean, Templeton's gonna have the place surrounded by guards.
we won't go in the front door.
Connor, thanks.
sorry about the mess.
I've seen worse.
I told you not to look down.
I think I made it abundantly clear to you how I feel about heights.
this is barely 20 feet.
it hardly qualifies as heights.
even if you did fall, you'd probably break something, but you wouldn't die.
one of my men has just informed me that a silent alarm in the East wing has been tripped.
Ah, the Princess is here.
she's trying to get to her mother.
have the motorcade brought round.
I'm going to have the Queen removed from the premises immediately.
I'll have my men secure the area.
the Princess will not leave here alive.
good.
there. Wasn't so bad, was it?
honored you could make it.
let's be civilized about this, shall we? Gents.
come on.
you feeling better about those fencing lessons?
Yeah.
Where's your mother?
there.
I've just gotten word from the NYPD.
there's a credible threat against the Queen.
I need her out of this building right now.
excuse me, your majesty.
this way, please.
mother. This way.
mother!
she's your wife. Get her under control.
mother! Wait.
Victoria, what in God's name?
Tony, what the hell are you doing? Come on!
you're killing me, you know that? Stop!
mother-- stop!
what is the meaning of this?
mother, this is Tony. He's...
I can see.
Walter tried to kill me for it.
templeton too.
and we have evidence to prove it.
things are not as they seem, your majesty.
all part of your duty to protect the crown?
always.
she's my daughter.
so you intend to marry this man?
if he'll have me.
then I can also assume you plan to abdicate your claim to the throne.
not without a fight, I won't.
Ah.
well then, this is a much longer conversation for another time.
Victoria, who's this?
christopher Chance, her majesty the Queen.
thank you, Mr. Chance.
vast crowds await the arrival of the Princess both inside and outside of the hall.
a romance that played out both in the tabloids
maybe he's got family money.
let it go, man.
things like this don't just happen, dude.
it ain't natural.
why do you even care?
she's got, like, four castles, dude.
not four homes, four castles.
one of them sits on, like, 50, 000 acres.
and that's the summer house.
well, they don't belong to her.
they belong to the Queen.
Yeah, but when the old lady kicks it, it all goes Victoria...
and Prince Tony.
did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe she fell for this guy because he saves people for a living?
because he throws himself out there to help people who are in need?
I bet he is in a band.
you a hot mess.
it's not like I never had my shot with royalty.
a stripper wearing a tiara does not constitute royalty.
not talking about her, dude.
talking about Ruki.
third daughter to a Maasai warrior chief.
she dug me.
timing didn't quite work out.
I'm just saying, I know what I'm talking about here.
okay.
what, you don't believe me?
not even a little bit.
ask Chance. He was there, he'll vouch.
all right, fair enough.
when Chance comes back from the wedding,
I'll ask him if you in fact had the opportunity to marry into an African bush monarchy.
back from the wedding?
Yeah.
he's not at the wedding.
what do you mean he's not at the wedding?
I saw him get the plane ticket and the invitation.
Yeah, he's at the wedding. What do you mean?
he's not at the wedding.
well, where the hell is he?
shouldn't you be getting married right now?
well, I'm to it is a breach of protocol for them to begin without me.
did you not get my invitation?
well, I'm not a big fan of weddings.
I can tell by the roar of the crowd that you're still a royal.
well, mother's warming to the idea.
you were right, I got my happy ending.
well, you had a 50/50 chance.
I was rooting for you.
you know, you never told me her name, the woman who turned your world upside down.
her name was Katherine.
would you tell me what happened to her?
enjoy your wedding day, your highness.
the TRIPLE FRONTIER SOUTH AMERICA
you have come a long way for nothing.
I'm here to purchase the release of Susan Connors from the man I assume is your employer Miguel Cervantes.
I'm prepared to offer... - No.
I think Mr. Cervantes might feel differently when he hears how much I'm willing to pay.
there is no Cervantes. There is no Susan Connors.
no, wait, wait.
your boss kidnapped a journalist from her hotel room in Asuncion four days ago.
now, that journalist happens to be a friend of mine.
and I'm prepared to pay an obscene amount of money.
so don't be stupid.
you are being sent home as a courtesy.
most who make it this far aren't so lucky.
don't come back.
I'm sorry. You went where?
because I thought you said that you tried to see Miguel Cervantes, the most dangerous warlord on The Triple Frontier, which is saying something, and that you did it alone.
Yes.
help me out here cause when we discussed this the other day,
I explained to you that no one knows where to find Cervantes.
Yes. -- And that they kill people down there for even asking.
you're worried about me.
I'm worried about who's gonna pay the bills around here if you end up dead in some South American gutter somewhere.
it's been almost five days since Susan went missing investigating a story about Cervantes.
and we all agree that if Cervantes simply wanted her dead, he would've done it publicly.
so she's probably still alive. -- Probably.
the State Department can't act because they have no way of getting a message to him.
the local governments won't act because they're afraid of him.
and when I asked you about rescue options, you said there weren't any.
well, I meant that I couldn't think of any.
well, what's the difference?
in the interim, I may have thought of one.
well, what is it?
I've known this woman since we were children.
well, it's a little unorthodox. You might not like it. But could be worth a try.
no. No.
hell, no. -- Oh, you got my note.
Yeah, I got your note. Bad idea.
terrible idea. I won't be a part of it.
won't be a part of what?
all right, let's just start at the beginning.
a few years ago, Miguel Cervantes hired an assassin to take out the President of Paraguay.
the assassin was successful. Was quite proud of himself, I might add.
we're talking about you.
no. Wasn't me. It was a guy I know.
anyway, Cervantes and this assassin had a falling out.
define falling out. -- Cervantes tried to kill him.
which means that the assassin might be inclined to help us stage a rescue.
dude. No. I mean, seriously.
this guy's a bad egg. You can't trust him.
Really? You see what's happening here?
we agree. Now imagine how that makes me feel.
you think I'm happy about this?
I didn't want to see him again let alone ask him for help.
but the lady wants to get her friend back so I don't have any better ideas. Do you?
will someone please tell me what's going on here?
who is this guy and why is it such a big deal to ask for his help?
he was picked up by the FBI then he was traded to the Russians.
apparently they wanted him more than our guys did.
he's not gonna be easy to get to, but I just don't see any other way.
Drankov. FSB.
which way to the Special Prisoner's section?
over there. - Spasiba.
so the only person who can help rescue Susan is a professional killer you neither like nor trust who's currently rotting in a Siberian prison, and these two think you're completely crazy for even suggesting it.
is that a vaguely accurate picture of what we're talking about here?
pretty much.
Oh, last time I saw him, we tried to kill each other.
look, I know it sounds bad. But if we're gonna stage a rescue for Susan, - I think... - Do it.
whatever it takes.
we have to get Susan out of there alive.
just out of curiosity, can you tell me the name of this assassin?
well, he goes by several names.
but the one I know him by is...
Hello, matey.
siberia Kolyma prison
I wish I knew you were coming.
might've cleaned up the place for you.
this isn't a social call.
Miguel Cervantes kidnapped a journalist named Susan Connors.
there's reason to believe she's alive, being held in his compound.
and this pertains to me how?
I need your help.
is that a fact?
I know that Cervantes' compound is well guarded.
I know that getting in and out cleanly is gonna take some finesse.
what I don't know... - is where to find him.
tell me where to find the compound--that's all I need.
and what do I get out of this exactly?
you get to get off your ass, come up here, and point your finger on a map or I get the guards to open this door and I come in there.
man, I missed you.
so what's the story with those two anyway?
well, before Chance was...Chance, he and Baptiste worked for the same boss.
a master assassin who took them both in and trained them.
they called him "the old man.
and in a weird way, they were the closest thing Chance had to family.
so why does Chance hate him so much?
he wanted out of that life.
well, that didn't go over too well.
and a woman close to Chance ended up getting killed over it.
Baptiste killed her?
I promise you, do not mess with me on this one.
and I promise you that's not my intention.
I just simply do not know where the compound is.
you were there yourself. -- Blindfolded on the way in.
and coming out, transportation was provided for me.
provided by who? -- A gentleman by the name of Esteban.
he's a local enemy of Cervantes.
the Triple Frontier is not a particularly welcoming place.
Esteban helped because he knew me.
but for you, not so much.
what are you saying? -- What am I saying?
I'm saying I can't help you find Cervantes unless you take me with you.
fat chance. Have a nice life.
you will never find her without me.
Cervantes is a ghost down there.
and if you had another option, you wouldn't be here in the first place.
what's this all about anyway?
you want to get close to Cervantes? You want to kill him? Settle a score? What?
grudges are for the weak of spirit. And you know that's not me.
then why?
geezer has my watch. -- I beg your pardon?
the target Cervantes hired me to liquidate, he wore a vintage Breguet, Heritage Collection.
it's a work of art, really. And when I escaped, it got left behind.
give me the chance to retrieve it and I'll help you save the girl.
I give you my word, junior.
what the hell are you doing to my conference room?
does she really need to know or is this one of those things it's better off if she doesn't?
sidebar.
it's hardware that allows us to piggyback on a military spy satellite so we can keep an eye on Chance and Baptiste.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that that's illegal.
extremely.
look, I didn't want Chance talking to Baptiste in the first place, remember?
at least this way, wherever they go, I can watch his back.
I need temporary custody of prisoner Baptiste.
custody? What makes you think I would agree to that?
this, my friend, is a Private Bank of Geneva Black Card.
airport club access, concierge services, no spending limit.
compliments of Ilsa Pucci.
I'll have Baptiste back in 48 hours. Until then, knock yourself out.
there is only one problem.
prisoners must be within sight of a guard at all times.
Uh-uh. Not now.
I need you on your toes.
plus I don't have to tell you what's gonna be waiting for us when we get off this plane.
let's go over some ground rules.
ground rules? We're at grammar school now, are we?
rule number one, cuffs stay on at all times. -You're kidding me.
rule number two, you will not touch a weapon of any kind.
I'm ashamed to know you. I truly am.
rule number three. When this is finished, you're going straight back to that prison.
are we clear? -- All except rule number three.
that's non-negotiable.
we'll see.
who is that?
his name's Captain Mike Harmen. He's the contact of the Defense Department.
I've been on the phone with him all week trying to get some help with Susan.
I'll be right with you, Captain Harmen.
I'll go with you. -- Why?
Highly-illegal satellite setup.
chance on ground with fugitive assassin.
we need to make sure this goes very carefully.
I once sat a poker table with Rumsfeld, Kissinger, and the Chief of Operations for the Mossad.
so? -- Rummy still owes me 1, 000 bucks.
so what can I do for you, Captain?
Mrs. Pucci, we have a problem.
look, I get it.
you told me not to go after Susan Connors and I went anyway.
your boss put some heat on you. He told you to come down here and put some heat on me.
can't we just save ourselves some time and go get some lunch?
we certainly could...
had I not received this message just before I arrived here.
what is that?
that is a photograph sent by my liaison in the Paraguayan Army of your private plane sitting in an airfield just a few miles away from The Triple Frontier.
that's the ground. Why are you disconnecting the ground wire?
I think we've got a problem. - What kind of problem?
captain Mike Harmen has asked the Paraguayan Army to seize my plane.
I think Chance just lost his getaway.
where are your two friens?
there's a doorway down there on the right.
that's Esteban's place.
but before we go in, can I renew my objection to the current state of my hands?
I already told you. -- Yeah, I know. I know. Rule one.
thing is, folks around here don't take kindly to strangers asking questions.
what sense does it make to handicap ourselves from the outset?
you know what, you got a point.
better? -- Not even close.
greetings, matey. -- Drink, amigo?
whiskey.
so we're looking for Esteban. Have you seen him?
uh, yeah, we seem to have lost the keys.
it's a funny story, actually. -- You want to see Esteban,
Esteban does not want to see you.
put down the gun.
you first.
I asked you to put the gun down.
I won't ask again.
no. -- Oh, you are such a child.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
you asked me to help you find Esteban, and I'm doing that, but you're getting lost in the details, matey.
details my ass. Give me the gun.
this gun? You want this gun?
come and take it from me.
you don't think I can just smack you up and take that gun?
no, I really don't.
all right, folks, you're in for a little show.
what about a different plane?
is there no other way to fly them out of there?
not from down there. Not with this kind of notice.
we need to figure out a way to get Harmen to release that plane.
I've been dealing with him all week. He's not a "bend the rules" kind of guy.
what are you doing? I did that an hour ago. It doesn't work.
system INITIALIZING
you loosened the lid for me.
if Chance still has his phone, the satellite should be locked in on him.
right there.
what the hell are they doing?
well, it appears they're kicking the crap out of each other.
I assume this doesn't bode well for Susan's rescue.
zoom out, would you?
what's that?
that is a problem.
come on. Answer your phone.
answer your phone.
Hola, Esteban.
we were, um, hoping you could help us find Cervantes.
so, Esteban, is it fair to assume that you're now working for Cervantes?
where are they? - I don't know.
I got no signal to lock onto, man. He must've lost his phone.
how do we find him?
we don't.
no signal to latch on to. Could take hours to find him.
every minute we spend looking is a minute we take away from figuring out a way to get that plane off the ground.
so what, we just leave them there and hope for the best?
I don't like this any more than you do.
but right now, getting that plane free is the only way we can help get them home alive.
Yeah, that's assuming they're not dead already.
Hey! What? I'm just saying.
you said that Esteban helped you escape from Cervantes.
that they were mortal enemies or something.
Hey, may I remind you, if you hadn't lost your mind about me having a weapon, we probably wouldn't be in this mess.
you knew the rules. -- The rules. Here we go.
I don't trust you at all so we stick to the rules.
you have no idea how silly that sounds coming from you.
what I should trust you? -- Why shouldn't you?
when you left me and the old man, you said nothing.
that decision must've been brewing for--for quite a while, right?
so how many days?
how many conversations did me and you have during which the only thought in your head was about running away?
and you never said a word.
you call that being honest?
dig your graves.
dude, no way.
Why? It's a simple Norma Jean.
first of all, there's no such thing as a simple Norma Jean, all right?
when a Norma Jean goes bad, it goes real bad.
a Norma Jean went bad on my cousin Pat. She ended up pregnant with twins.
well, you got a better idea? -- Yeah.
let's call that Ames broad.
she went back East. Clear head after that heist debacle.
fine. Then I'll go.
and do what? Put a gun to Harmen's head?
what's wrong with putting a gun to his head?
a lot of productive things have happened by putting a gun to someone's head.
wait a second.
your friend, Captain Harmen, said he had a liaison down there with the Paraguayan Army.
that's probably who he called to seize the plane, right?
so why don't we call the guy ourselves, get him to release the plane?
we get into Harmen's office, find out who that liaison is and how to contact him.
then we figure out a way to make it look like Harmen's making the call to him.
we get into his office. But what if he's in his office?
Oh, that's easy. We'll just send you.
what? - Dude?
it's not a bad idea. - It certainly sounds like one.
I agree.
this ain't that hard.
the info we want is probably on Harmen's computer.
now you just go down there and you-- you make nice and say you're sorry about what happened before.
then you take a pirate modem. Put it close enough to his computer so I can hack into it.
the whole thing takes a couple of minutes.
he's right. It's a terrible idea.
I played poker with Rummy." What happened to that?
that was a game. What you're asking me to do...
I'm not a field operative.
listen, you want to see your friend Susan alive again, then you're gonna become one.
sorry. About before.
I probably should've taken those cuffs off you at the bar.
what, that's it?
what? You want me to be sorry about something else?
if you don't know, I'm not gonna explain it to you.
why don't I hear something like "hey, junior, "thanks for the last 24 hours. It was nice to get some fresh air.
you had a drink. You had a few laughs at my expense.
you got to admit, this day beats the crap out of any day you had in that prison cell.
I shouldn't have been in that jail cell for you to find me in the first place.
whose fault is that anyway? Don't get mad at me.
get mad at the old man.
when I got thrown in Chi Hoa, he busted me out in three weeks.
Yeah, well, that situation was different. - Why was it different?
cause that was you.
he cut you loose, didn't he?
Why?
is it because you got caught?
or maybe it was because you were doing the catching.
but your guess is as good as mine, mate.
but I haven't heard a word from him since the last time we saw each other.
hurry up.
Baptiste.
I'm surprised to see you again.
what are you doing here?
well, it appears I'm digging my own grave.
what are you doing here?
truth be told,
I'm in the market for a new job and I'm hoping that you're hiring.
you son of a...
you want to work for me?
Yes, I do.
very interesting. Let's discuss it then, shall we?
and what about this one? -- I don't know.
he may some value to you.
thanks for bringing me down here, junior.
sorry it had to be this way.
and, uh, sorry about this.
Oh, you're awake.
I'm Susan.
Yeah, I heard a little bit about you.
I'm Christopher Chance. Ilsa Pucci sent me here to rescue you.
Ilsa sent you? - Yeah.
to rescue me? - Mm-hmm.
and, uh, how's this rescue going?
could be worse.
So...What brings a nice journalist like you to a place like this?
well, I came down here chasing a story trying to tie Cervantes to the murder of this country's President.
just before I got caught, I found the link.
witnesses who can blow the story wide open.
Cervantes wants to know who talked.
so far, my interrogators have been keeping things fairly polite.
but something tells me with you here, that's about to change.
Yeah, it's a pretty safe bet. Listen, can you reach my pants with your foot?
in the lining of my pocket flap, there's a syringe filled with anesthetic.
maybe we could use it on your friend when he comes back.
do I need to ask why you have a full syringe of anesthetic in your pocket?
well, I brought someone with me to help find you.
someone who I was worried might try to screw me over.
and where exactly is this someone now? -Screwing me over.
join me. Please.
Baptiste.
your track record is quite impressive.
prime Minister Goetz. Justice Rabang in Manila.
you're an artist.
but our history together, it makes your proposal, while tempting, also somewhat difficult to believe.
our past is what it is.
you were unhappy with my work. That's your prerogative.
I'd hired you to do a job -you hired me to eliminate a man, which I did.
and you wanted him humiliated, tortured.
it's simply not me. It's inelegant.
is that my watch?
no. That is Esteban's watch. A gift from me.
well, then let's forget about our past and discuss our future, shall we?
be careful. -I've almost got it.
I can't believe that worked.
me neither.
all right, he's probably got a knife on him-- let's find it and cut ourselves down.
put that in your ear.
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm doing this.
it's gonna be easy.
just take this pirate modem. See? So you turn it on right there.
get that within range of Harmen's computer.
and I'll take it from there.
all right, I'm in position.
she moving yet? - Getting there.
take your time, dude.
view's real nice from up here.
so what's he doing again?
he's gonna splice into their switchboard so that when we call Paraguay to get your plane released, it'll sound like the call's coming from Harmen's office.
now, listen, once we're logged in, Harmen gets locked out of his computer.
so he can't be on there while I'm doing my search.
so how do I keep him from looking at his computer?
opening a button might help.
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
you sure?
Mrs. Pucci.
Hello, Captain.
how are you? -- I'm fine.
what are you doing down here?
I don't feel very good about yesterday, and I was hoping we could maybe talk about it a little bit.
come in.
Margaret, this is Ilsa Pucci.
hello. -- Hello. Margaret.
please tell me Margaret is not sitting in front of the computer.
look, I can't hack in till you get her away from there.
Oh, it's a simple Norma Jean.
nothing to worry about.
Oh, shut up!
what I am offering you are the services of a professional without peer.
I think there's a path over there that leads to the front gate.
we're not taking the front gate. Baptiste said it's too heavily guarded.
do you know of any other way out?
he mentioned a back way, but I don't know where to find it.
well, you got any better ideas?
so please think carefully before you throw out a number less you insult me and lose out on this opportunity altogether.
20 million.
dollars?
u. S.for a year of your time.
there's one condition.
it's my understanding that the man you arrived here with was once quite close to you.
you understand I need to be certain that you and he are not playing me for a fool.
kill him and then we'll have a deal.
sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
good.
Hello, fellas.
if you've come to argue about your ground rules again,
I think you're going to be sorely disappointed.
we can discuss that later. That's not why I'm here.
no? Then why are you here?
to ask for your help.
I'm sorry?
you're asking for my help? Still?
I'm getting real tired of it too.
but you know the way out of here, I don't.
you gave me your word. I came here to see what it's worth.
I am deeply sorry I have to do this.
but I will be taking that watch back now.
get in!
chance, where the hell are you? What's going on?
we've got Susan. We're heading to the plane. Is there anything else I should know?
Yeah. Stand by.
Ilsa, you need to hurry.
I'm a little confused. You're here to apologize about yesterday?
Yes.
so you admit the plane down there is part of a rescue mission?
I've been advised not to answer that question.
all right, I'm patched into the switchboard.
she got the modem on yet?
not yet.
Ilsa. Listen, you got to get that damn computer clear.
I'm sorry. Could you ask your secretary if she could give us a minute to speak in private?
I am a Senior Policy Analyst.
thank you, Margaret.
chance, we're trying to free up the plane. We need a couple of minutes.
I don't have a couple of minutes.
please have a seat.
we're in.
all right, Mrs. Pucci, what is it you want to talk about?
modem's been activated. We're uploading.
well...I feel as if we don't really know each other very well.
Hey, save a bullet. -- Why?
machinegun nests either side of the rear gate.
once we get around the turn, about 30 meters.
not gonna give us much time.
about two or three seconds and then we're full of holes.
okay, turn's coming. You ready? -- Ready.
next left! Take it!
come on, dude, give me a number.
hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
so I assume you went to college.
Yeah. Yes, I did.
did you like it?
Mrs. Pucci, you come all the way down here.
you offer me one of the more bizarre apologies I've ever heard.
you dismiss a woman from my office who is probably going to be my boss one day to ask me questions about where I went to school and whether or not I'm allowed to wear jeans on fridays?
what are you doing here? And I want a straight answer.
well...
that's a completely fair question.
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
one moment. -- Are you seeing anyone?
did you just ask me out? -- Yeah.
Yes, I did.
I just felt there might be some chemistry here between us.
you?
got it. Good job, Ilsa. We're done. Get out of there.
okay then. I better go.
captain Carlos Montoya. 2nd division.
sending you the number. -- Got it.
this is Captain Harmen. I need to speak to Captain Montoya right away.
Montoya. -- Montoya, this is Harmen.
release the plane immediately. -- Yes, sir.
there's a military barricade.
what should I do? They're not moving.
just don't stop.
you know, with most people, when I haven't seen them for a few months, the big surprise is they've changed their hair.
what the hell are you doing here?
truthfully, I have no idea.
I guess I'm... I'm doing what Marshall would've wanted me to.
Yeah.
so where did you find the guy? Chance?
Oh, God. -- Really? I don't know.
seemed nice enough to me.
excuse me a sec, Susan.
So...What are you doing here?
Oh, I think we both know what I'm doing here.
your plane was released from local control roughly 18 hours ago.
communications mix-up according to my contact down there.
and now I see Susan Connors sitting in your office safe and sound.
you gamed me.
I don't know how, but you did.
you know, there is one more thing I'd like to know.
what?
when you asked me if I was seeing someone, was that part of the game or did you really want to know?
I think...
well, uh, I would ask you to remember that...
given the context -- so I'll pick you up at 8: 00.
don't do it.
it's not even the most expensive one on the tray.
no. But it's your favorite so you can't have any.
yet again. Focused on the little details and missing out on the bigger picture.
which is? -- That you trusted me.
and you were rewarded for that trust.
let's go overboard here, okay? I know you better than you think.
and there was a moment back there where you were thinking about shooting me.
I was not. -- Yes, you were.
well, the man made a convincing argument. And I do have material needs.
I'm only human.
and besides, it suddenly occurred to me that
and despite what this says about me and despite how truly distressing the thought...
you might be the last friend I've got on this earth.
I've spent most of the last six years wishing you were dead.
we're not friends. Not by any definition I know of.
well, yeah, beggars can't be choosers, right?
it makes this so much more unpleasant. Hold this.
Really?
in my defense, I was extremely frank about my intentions on this trip.
I simply can't have you put me back in that cell.
I think we both know you're not gonna shoot me.
Oh, come on. What did he ever do to you?
let's discuss what's gonna happen next.
I'm gonna enjoy a glass of my favorite cognac.
you tell the pilot we're diverting to Caracas.
once we land, I'll walk out.
I think you know that I can't let that happen.
be that as it may...salud.
I have a counter proposal.
do you now?
come work for me.
I beg your pardon? -- You heard me.
I think you enjoyed helping.
I think there's more to the old man cutting you off story than you're letting on.
I think you're about where I was three years ago.
and no more ready to talk about it either.
you're joking.
maybe. You saying you don't trust me?
not one...
ketamine in the cognac.
Yeah, I figured you couldn't resist.
sorry, but I was Frank about my intentions.
I got to take you back to where I got you.
that's very clever.
man, I really missed you.
do I even want to know?
probably not. So what happened with Baptiste?
I offered him a job. -- Dude, seriously?
I don't have to put up with enough around here?
he turned it down.
at least there's still a little integrity left among criminals. So where is he?
well, let's see. Right about now it should be chow time in Siberia.
bet he didn't want to part with that.
So...How'd you get the Paraguayan Army to let us on the plane?
Norma Jean. -- It's impossible.
can't bluff a Norma Jean with just two guys.
they had some help.
are you serious? I'm gone two days and she's out on the field?
not my call, dude. I'll clean that later.
Mr. Chance, I told you I was prepared to rescue Susan by any means necessary.
but I thought we had this conversation.
there's about a million things that could've gone wrong. You could've been arrested.
you were risking your life to save my friend. The least I could do was risk my reputation.
suppose a "thank you" is in order.
no. It's I who should thank you for bringing Susan safely home.
it looks like it wasn't easy.
Oh, comes with the turf.
sometimes a mission stays with you after it's done.
so I'm learning. Good night.
where you going?
I guess we both made a bit of a sacrifice on this one.
I have a date...with Captain Harmen.
who's capt...
washington, D.C.
Hey, got a couple bucks?
go away.
Hey, buddy.
you hear me?
right.
so this is a mugging, then, is it?
your money.
now.
Really?
look at how I'm dressed, mate.
how much money could you possibly think you're gonna get from me?
use your head.
give me your money.
and the watch.
you know, a man's watch is a very cherished thing.
you steal that, might as well be stealing his soul.
do yourself a favor, sweetheart.
run along.
now!
you'll have a hard time killing me with all these witnesses.
I don't care.
Oh, you care.
too much, actually.
you shoot me, those cops over there will start firing at you.
bystanders will get cut down by the crossfire.
people start falling off of the platforms onto the tracks.
be a veritable stam -- Stampede.
and even if you survive, I know you.
you'll be haunted forever.
the train gets here in four minutes, Baptiste.
next arrival: 4 minutes
soon as everyone boards, there'll be nobody left to get in the way.
what?
you gonna shoot me?
in cold blood?
you know, at might be worth hanging around for.
because I am really curious whether or not you still got it in you to do that.
well, I guess we'll find out, won't we?
next arrival: 3 minutes 8 hours earlier
not like him to leave a body just out in the open like this.
we weren't supposed to find it.
which one of you is Winston?
s. F. P. D. I'm Winston.
this is Seaver.
thanks so much for holding the scene for us.
M. O. seemed strange enough, I had to run it.
when I did, your name popped up from an old S. F. P. D. case.
John Doe, no I. D.
fingerprints appear to have been melted off by some sort of acid.
high-caliber entry wounds, no exit wounds.
coroner's gonna try to pull a slug to trace it.
he won't be able to.
this is a polymer-tipped, reverse-tapered jacket.
it's custom-made.
you won't find it at any gun shop.
left the ring, took the watch.
found the body in a dumpster?
Yeah.
total fluke we found it.
hobo over there went dumpster diving, came across it.
look, am I dealing with some kind of a serial killer here?
not exactly--our guy's an assassin for hire.
dispose of the body so that, even if it were found, wouldn't be able to I. D.
it for at least 24 hours.
he makes sure of that by dissolving the prints.
this guy has a thing for.
contingency plans.
and wristwatches.
it's Baptiste.
so if this is an assassin, isn't his job finished already?
Oh, no. He's just getting started.
thanks so much, detective.
call us if you find anything.
so.
we got an assassin that likes high-value targets, on the loose in a city full of high-value targets.
and he's got a six-hour head start.
told you he'd pop his head up again.
when he did -- I know, I know.
Hey, look, man, I know what this guy took from you.
I know what you want to do to him, And I don't think there's a person in the world who'd blame you for it.
but.
no buts.
whatever you want.
come on.
you!
me.
you look great.
what are you so dressed up for?
you're under arrest.
for what?
knocking on your door?
try obstruction of justice, for starters!
you were party to what happened at the embassy, and you fled!
there was no one to corroborate my story.
no one believed me!
what difference does it make?
we got the bad guy.
I was humiliated.
two-week suspension, loss of pay, permanent reprimand in my file.
I'm sorry.
is everything all right in there?
Hey, how's it going?
Emma, what's going on here?
everything's under control.
but can you grab my handcuffs?
they're in the bedroom chest, bottom drawer.
you keep your handcuffs in your -- Ohh!
shut up!
listen, this is fun and all.
but I've got a problem that's a little time sensitive.
so, Emma, looks like you're in the middle of something here.
thanks for understanding.
sorry, it's my job.
rain check for Saturday night.
Citronelle, my treat.
I'll call you!
can we talk about my thing now?
I wouldn't do that.
you turn me in, somebody very important dies tonight.
who's "someone very important"?
I don't know the target, but I know the assassin.
his name is Baptiste, And he's here in Washington tonight.
this is the case of a lifetime.
I'm just handing it to you.
give me couple minutes to explain.
prime minster of Argentina.
senator Stanton's plane crash about six years ago.
what do they have in common?
accidental deaths that were rumored not to have been so accidental.
not accidents.
flawless hits.
Baptiste hits.
that's why they're paying the big bucks.
he doesn't make mistakes.
there's no trail.
it's like he doesn't even exist.
what makes you so sure he's gonna strike tonight?
a John Doe shows up dead a few hours ago, one of Baptiste's custom-made bullets inside of him.
no I. D. fingerprints burned off.
he's wearing a huntsman's suit from Savile Row.
he's got a shirt from Bergdorf's on fifth avenue.
he's got a coat check slip from the Rose Cafe on 44th and First Ave.
44th and First?
you know what's across the street?
the United Nations.
Baptiste stole the identity of a European living in New York who works for the U. N.
so Baptiste killed him for access.
which means he is here to assassinate a foreign dignitary.
look, he's already got a head start.
his cover is airtight.
he's already dissected the patterns, the personnel, the vulnerabilities of the target's protection detail.
he's planned for every contingency you could imagine, and probably some that you can't.
he will not fail, unless we stop him.
so this guy's so good that he takes out heads of state and nobody even knows it was a murder.
he's a ghost.
somehow, you know that he's here.
you know his methods.
you know his resume.
how is it that no one else in the world knows this, but you do?
because I trained him.
I don't get you.
we were a good team.
and then you.
have to become all Dudley Do-Right.
nobody deserves to die.
everybody deserves to die.
as far as someone is concerned.
that's human nature.
and you taught me that.
I was wrong.
and then what do you do?
you turn around and you start some.
crusade.
to save people.
you don't even get the irony of it, do you?
the sad irony that, with all your effort, the people you cared most about saving, they're the ones that got hurt the worst.
and if there was ever any doubt about that, I think this evening's unfortunate events have put that to rest.
haven't they?
you trained an assassin? - Yeah
okay, and one would have to assume that in order to train an assassin, one would have to be an assassin.
look, that's not the point.
I'm trying to save somebody's life here.
the point is whether or not I can trust you.
I don't even know your damn name!
it's Christopher Chance.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but we're kind of running out of time.
I remember you from the embassy!
nice dress.
what the hell are you doing?
just unlock it.
hang that for me?
sure, why not?
are we all here now?
excuse me, it's kind of heavy. Going right there.
who the hell are all these people?
what is going on?
uh, Guerrero Winston, new girl.
Layla.
there you go.
we ruined her company, thought we'd give her a shot.
least we could do.
this is Agent Barnes.
how you doing?
I'm gonna go ahead and set up right here.
stop. Wait. What are you talking about?
don't touch that!
you got any idea what Baptiste's plan is?
well, I was thinking it was some version of a West Point, but then there's no way he could get the uniform in time.
then I was thinking maybe a reverse lifeboat?
Yeah, um, listen.
about.
you want to make us a pot of coffee?
I saw the way you were looking at her at the embassy.
okay, this is all in your head.
sure it is.
listen, all I hope is that this woman has the good sense to keep you at arm's length and treat this case with the same kind of objectiv -- Oh, dear God.
looks like a teenage girl's locker.
she went a little heavy on the chin, don't you think?
this is an ongoing F. B. I. investigation.
do you mind?
what do you guys want from me?
how about the white list?
uh -- The white list?
uh, the minute-to-minute itinerary of visiting dignitaries.
I know what the white list is.
I don't have access to it.
deputy Director Lynch does.
and what do you want me to tell her?
that the ghost that I've been hunting since the russian embassy is in my apartment, and he says that there's an assassin who doesn't exist that's gonna kill somebody tonight, unless I stop it?
I think that's a terrible idea.
I was thinking we just break into her office and take it.
you think I'm gonna help you break into the J. Edgar Hoover Federal building?
well, technically, your I. D. gets us into the federal building.
we just want to break into her office.
you're insane.
okay, listen.
I know I screwed you over at the embassy, and I'm sorry.
but do you really think I would risk being hauled off to jail if I didn't think that lives were in danger?
Baptiste is on the hunt.
he's got U. N. credentials.
this is not an accident.
protection of foreign diplomats is the job of the F. B. I. not the U. N.
exactly.
that's why he's gonna use his cover to convince somebody high up in U. N.
security that there's a threat, then he can.
gain access to the F. B.I.
yes? May I help you?
Mr. lecavalier...
...I'm sorry it has taken us so long to finally meet in person.
I trust Pauline and Claire are well?
when last we talked, The twins were just starting university, no?
Yes, they're very well.
okay, so I have some grave news.
I have discovered a security breach in operation olive branch.
this operation is classified, eyes only.
I'm the only one at the U. N. that's supposed to know about it.
and I only learned of it a few days ago.
I came across an intercept of an unnamed assassin.
he was hired out of Europe, And olive branch is his target.
why did you wait so long to inform me of this?
it took a while to confirm my intelligence.
I had to be certain, no?
I have to alert the F. B. I. immediately.
of course.
Jean Lecavalier for Deputy Director Lynch on a matter of urgent importance.
Yes.
thank you.
hopefully, we're not too late.
director Lynch.
I have Rene Dupont here.
he's from our New York office.
he has brought to light some legitimate concerns regarding this evening's operation.
Yes.
in person would be best.
we are leaving right now.
we have to go quickly.
Oh, I don't need to bother you with this any further.
no, no, this is the way it's done.
that is a very nice watch.
J. Edgar Hoover federal building
Hey, Tim.
s. F. P. D. just have to run through some mug shots with him.
detective Seaver.
okay.
you need to leave the case here, detective.
Thanks. There you go.
uplink confirmed
okay, we are in their network.
gonna link you up to the security feed.
and then I'm gonna work on the card readers.
so I'm looking at what they're looking at, live?
impressed yet?
getting in's the easy part, guys.
getting them out again, that's what separates the pros from the amateurs.
that's not yours.
Yeah, good luck getting through to him.
this your first time freelancing?
Why?
Oh, here we go.
well, we don't get benefits, there is no job security, and nobody gives you a cake on your birthday.
freedom.
whatever's in the fridge is fair game.
Yes, chapter one of the freelancer's manifesto.
how not to get invited back.
industry standard, dude.
FBI firewall protected
define "uh-oh."
I think they know I'm here.
bitlocker drive encryption -- process stopped
okay.
Yeah, they definitely know I'm here.
trying to get through my firewall.
unraveling my traceback redirects.
thought you said you knew what you were doing.
didn't your old outfit, Sentronics, help design the F. B. I security architecture?
turns out the F. B. I. has made some upgrades since then.
okay, I can hold them off.
but it's gonna slow everything else down.
what are we waiting for?
lynch is on the sixth floor, right?
if I push that button, there's no turning back.
aiding and abetting a known fugitive, trespassing on federal property.
breaking and entering on federal property.
violation of the espionage act of 1917, and conspiracy to commit treason.
could you be a little more dramatic?
so what was that -- your third, fourth date, something like that?
excuse me?
that guy in your apartment.
Roger. - Right.
and I'm fairly certain that's none of your business.
sorry.
what makes you think it was a third date?
nothing.
didn't sound like nothing.
your bra.
my what?
Yeah, it was like a third-date bra.
it was black with the little lacey thingy.
it was the kind of bra that looked like it was going to be making an appearance.
I noticed it when you were assaulting me.
it was a first date.
rene Dupont to see Deputy Director Lynch.
okay.
okay.
elevator's over there.
sixth floor, sir.
you know what never made any sense to me?
when you left.
it wasn't for principles.
or money.
it was for a girl.
Carrie or Kelly or - Her name was Katherine.
that's right. Katherine.
and you took it so personally.
like you really thought I took some pleasure out of killing her.
you gotta believe me, mate, it was completely the opposite.
I was embarrassed.
cause we'd always had each other's back, and then there I was, cleaning up your mess.
I can see how that'd be difficult for you.
you gotta tell me.
how does a man throw away everything for a woman that he barely knows?
I've lost sleep trying to make sense of it.
and then here we are, six years later, and you've done exactly the same thing.
I hope there's not gonna be any hard feelings this time.
because what happened to Agent Barnes.
that's entirely on you, mate.
you brought her into this.
not me.
I'm beginning to think this is a really bad idea.
speaking of bad ideas, that whole "you're under arrest" thing, that was just to prove a point, right?
Yes, the point being you're a criminal and you belong in jail.
this is Lynch's section.
there shouldn't be anyone here.
Guerrero, how we doing on those permissions?
new girl - Layla.
Layla's almost got 'em transferred.
how long?
T. B. D. dude.
security's gonna figure out we're not supposed to be here.
he'll get it. Come here
listen, just a few things to recommend me.
I've got a decent taste in music.
I'm good with animals and kids.
I'm not a great cook, but I'm learning.
if you give me a few hours, I could just lay all this out for you.
maybe dinner.
I'm sorry, y - y -- you wanna go out on a date with me?
well, it's a little early now, but, I mean, if you're asking.
sure.
I'm not asking.
okay, tell him to try it again.
go ahead, Chance.
they're ready.
told you.
holy moly.
so much for no one being here.
Barnes, what are you doing here?
you're not on this detail.
were you read-on to protocol 337?
no.
exactly.
it's above your pay grade.
lynch assigned me last-minute.
who's this?
Oh, Patrick McManus, U.N. liaison.
just here to help out.
it's a restricted operation.
I'm gonna have to run him.
Yeah, of course.
you're not in the system, are you?
not yet.
Yeah, Chance, I'm on it.
get this back in the system, quick.
who's Patrick McManus?
he's a cover we've used before.
come on, we need you to get him into the security personnel database.
that's not nearly as easy as it sounds.
they know I'm here.
they'll find me in a few minutes.
Yeah, well, they're gonna shoot Chance in, like, 30 seconds, so I wouldn't worry about that right now.
that kind of pressure doesn't help.
I have complete faith in you.
they don't do covert protection details unless it's a big deal.
it's big enough to bring in Baptiste.
we just need to find out who they're protecting.
is that MacManus?
Yeah, just try all the variations.
they always mess it up.
they're calling this operation olive branch.
H-hour is midnight.
it goes till dawn.
sounds like a long meeting.
I have a theory.
you first.
the fax machine: Letter head from the Chinese embassy.
I heard an agent speaking in a Taiwanese dialect.
big protection detail -- something sensitive, secret, worthy of disrupting.
taiwan and China are having a secret meeting somewhere in D. C.
exactly.
we just got to figure out where.
he's good to go.
off the books meaning somewhere in the D. C.area.
be somewhere inconspicuous.
someplace they could close down quietly.
call it a gas leak or something, so nobody's paying attention.
I'm gonna call one of my guys down at Metro.
see if he's noticed any red flags.
good.
you know, I don't get it.
what would someone have to gain from attacking that meeting?
Yeah, why would anyone want to stop two countries that spend over $60 billion a year on defense from making peace?
they'll prep several sites for the meeting.
nobody but Lynch will know the final destination till right before midnight.
he's here.
you pull a gun in here, you'll be dead in three seconds.
what the hell is Barnes doing here?
I don't know.
she said she was clear.
not by my office.
excuse me.
he's on the run. Let's go.
get Barnes over here.
we should just come clean.
by the time we convince them, Baptiste will have completed his mission and moved on.
I gotta stop him.
you're either with me or not.
it's up to you.
chance, I just saw Baptiste leave the building.
he's in a silver sedan, headed east.
Baptiste must have gotten the address from Lynch somehow.
maybe we'll get lucky and they'll cancel the operation.
you gotta think it took years to get these guys to sit down together in the first place.
they're not gonna cancel unless it's absolutely necessary.
Baptiste is counting on that.
Hello?
I should really apologize.
this is.
inelegant.
and ordinarily, I'd never even consider indulging the impulse.
but there's something I really need to know, darling.
who the hell is this?
our mutual friend there.
he's fallen into some very self-destructive behavior.
and just as we got past the whole Jatherine Walters fiasco,
I'm really worried that he's going down the same road with you.
so I suppose what I'm asking, and you really must forgive me for prying, but are you two an item?
it's been a while, Baptiste.
speak of the devil.
we were just talking about you.
yeah?
maybe we should meet up and continue this conversation.
funny you should say that.
I was just thinking the same.
in all fairness.
we should be the ones angry at you.
he's using you.
he used me. It's...
what he does.
used you?
the old man took you in when you had nothing.
he taught you a trade.
he treated us both like we were sons, and what did you do?
you betrayed him.
but it wasn't enough just to leave, was it?
you had to take that name.
that name.
you broke his heart.
I should have broke more than that.
see, me he respects.
but you were his favorite.
and when you left.
he took it very badly.
how do you think that was for me?
trying to figure out what the hell happened to you while trying to keep him in check.
it was exhausting.
you should have let me finish it.
Yeah, obviously.
because now, I'm gonna have to hear it all over again.
what a hothead you are -- making it all personal.
trying to provoke him.
trying to get him to come after you.
seriously, I mean, which one is it?
have you really changed?
do you have a death wish?
or did you just lose your edge?
Barnes, wake up.
let's go, come on.
chance, you all right?
Winston, yeah, we're okay.
we just got t-boned by Baptiste at the corner of Capital and E.
heading to you now.
all right.
if you could hack into the phone company's operations database, could you get the numbers to all the disposable cell phones activated in the past week?
sure, yeah.
um, why would we want to do that?
Baptiste uses burners when he's on the job.
if we could find the one he's using right now, I could call and maybe get him to give away his position.
you do realize there's got to be thousands of those things activated in a week?
but only one that just called agent Barnes.
Hey, mate.
Hello, dude.
it's been a while.
Yeah, hey, uh.
funny story.
a while big this, uh, skinny thug blackmailed me to get dirt on Chance.
guy wouldn't tell me who he worked for, so I.
I killed him.
any Chance you're the one holding the leash?
no.
it wasn't me.
your boss, then?
listen, I'm a little busy here, as I'm sure you'd appreciate.
so no offense.
Hey, no offense at all.
in fact, that's what I'm calling about.
business proposition.
10% of tonight's take to guarantee your success.
I'm guessing, what, seven figures?
I'm sorry.
are you saying that you're willing to betray our old friend?
in this economy, whatever pays the bills, dude.
anyone else, then, yeah.
but he's the one person that you would never turn against.
not yet, anyway.
not until you've lost everything.
Oh, by the way, I never got a chance to congratulate you on becoming a family man.
how old is the little one right now?
you know, when we're finished with you, you're gonna beg to return to the fold.
doesn't look like he gave anything away.
actually, he did.
okay.
it's time for you to finally start giving me some answers.
you know everything I do.
the guy kills people for money.
we gotta stop him. It's that simple.
who's Katherine Walters?
I used to work for some bad people.
I gathered that.
my old boss, he found me when I was young.
angry, alone.
and then he used it.
he told me that what I was doing was right.
that the person on the other side of the gun deserved it.
you know, for a long time, I believed it.
who's Katherine Walters?
she was the last assignment of an old life.
and I couldn't do it.
why not?
she was kind.
she was honest.
she didn't deserve it.
you loved her.
and I tried to protect her, but.
the guy they sent next was just too good.
Baptiste.
if that doesn't make you believe in karma.
let's go!
come on.
apparently, Guerrero got a hold of Baptiste's number, and he called him.
how'd he get that?
looks like that Layla's working out.
new girl.
anyway, wherever Baptiste was, Guerrero said he heard church bells ringing in the background.
church bells?
see, that list you're looking at came from my buddy in Metro.
list of red flags in the area tonight.
only one location where there could be church bells.
Georgetown.
methane leak reported, Sanford Hall.
they'd have evacuated the entire area of campus.
perfect spot for a secret summit.
we're there in five minutes.
what are you doing?
hey there.
dispatch called in a problem with the transformers on the south side.
secret service ordered these covers welded shut!
and if there was a problem, I'd be the guy to call it in.
Really?
Yeah, that's a good point.
I suppose the good news is, one way or another, I'm gonna get some answers.
have you really completely changed?
become a whole, new man?
or is my old friend still in there somewhere?
your old friend would have put a bullet in you for what you did.
with complete disregard for the consequences, heh.
you know what's great is if I kill you now, there are no consequences.
I walk away, and this is over.
Oh, we both know better than that.
you kill me, all bets are off.
the old man is coming after you.
he will go after everyone, Everyone you have ever cared about.
he'll burn the city to the ground.
and you know it.
this is the blue line to Franconia-Springfield.
next stop, Arlington.
I hope this is it,'cause we're running out of options.
this is it, right here.
the welding on this manhole cover, it's been removed.
that's how he got in.
how do you know that?
security's so top heavy, there's no way he could have gotten in there without being seen.
that's what I'd do.
coming?
where are you going?
upstairs.
I'm gonna find the security detail, give them Baptiste's description, get them to clear the windows in case he takes a shot.
Nah, he won't.
target this big, this much security, he needs to be thorough.
he needs to take everyone out all at once.
he needs to.
blow up the building.
look at this.
it's ethylene oxide.
extremely flammable, odorless.
he's got it hooked up to the gas system.
that looks booby trapped.
that's probably a safe bet.
it's got a remote trigger.
we need to get Lynch and get everybody out of the building.
where are you going?
the only place with a clean line of sight and a good, strong cell reception.
agent Barnes.
we need to clear the building now.
the operation's been compromised.
we need to get everyone in that delegation out of here.
you've got a lot to answer for.
we need to evacuate.
no, you need to explain what in God's name you are doing here before I have you arrested.
all stations, check in.
grounds one, roger.
grounds two, roger.
spotter one, roger.
we are aware of the threat against this summit.
we have taken all the necessary precautions.
a rep from the U. N. debriefed me on this an hour ago.
the man you met earlier was not Rene Dupont.
he's an assassin named Baptiste.
the set this entire building to blow.
you have been increasingly erratic, ever since that fiasco at the russian embassy.
you're done.
put her under arrest and get her out of here, now.
send one of your men to the boiler room.
you're making a huge mistake!
ma'am, it's true.
I saw it myself.
okay.
clear the building.
now!
do we have a head count?
48
one short.
someone's still inside.
did everyone make it out of the building?
Barnes?
she went back to make sure it was clear.
I'm sorry, man.
Where's Baptiste?
he's gone.
Guerrero had Layla hack the phone company.
track all the calls Baptiste made in the last 12 hours.
the last call he made was to Amtrak.
that's his escape route.
I know, I'm on it, dude.
Hey, check out all the nearest subway stations that are closest -- Georgetown.
I know, I'm on it.
which way did Chance go? - south
Rosslyn station. Next closest one is Foggy Bottom, to the east.
all right, I'll take that.
Hey, and make sure that you -- scan the emergency channels.
I know, dude.
like I said, you'll get the hang of it.
you know, I wrenched my knee a little bit.
bruised my thigh.
along with the bullet in the arm and the knife in the chest.
but I can still run okay, If that's what you were wondering.
I'm just not going to.
although I think that you're hoping I do.
begging me to do something.
make a move for you.
make a run for it.
anything to give you the excuse to shoot me without it being in cold blood.
but you know what?
I don't think I'm gonna make it that easy for you.
you got the power now.
you can resolve this once and for all.
is it true that no one deserves to die?
or does that always get decided by the guy who holds the gun?
so this is it?
the moment of truth.
it's over, Baptiste.
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.
she made it out.
back entrance.
delegate took a little shrapnel, but other than that, he's okay, as is everyone else.
bollocks. - I got him.
H. R. T. 's on the way, place is surrounded.
it's over.
not for me.
Yeah, just give a second here, please, darling.
you shut up!
put the gun down.
this isn't you, not anymore.
you keep telling yourself that you've changed, and that people don't deserve to die.
but you and me, we both know the truth.
you've lost your edge.
works out perfectly for me, But it's really sad for you.
take this one in.
shackles and shotguns, double detail.
none of this Metro crap.
he's in federal custody as of this moment.
who's this?
he's with me.
get him out of here.
see ya.
I'm glad you're okay.
I, uh, I gotta get to work.
arrest of a lifetime and all.
thank you.
about that.
dinner.
we're done here. You don't have to do that.
Oh, I don't have to.
so.
is it always like this?
like what?
well, it's certainly -- It's more stressful than my old gig.
but.
we saved all those people.
we got an assassin.
I don't know.
it was -- it was fun.
it was fun?
Yeah.
that's just the adrenaline in your system.
you're gonna crash later.
this line of work, there's nothing worse than the highs and lows.
nothing's ever what you think it is.
nothing's ever over.
Ooh, matey.
that's a nice watch.
looks like Emil is good and angry.
well, so far, so good.
what?
so, say it already.
what?
four days earlier
you're like an open book. It's written all over your face.
all right, genius, since you know me so well, what am I thinking right now?
well, you're worried because we're going to see somebody who's not exactly my biggest fan.
you're second guessing.
not exactly your biggest fan.
the man told you if he ever saw you again, he'd shoot you in the kneecaps,
stuff you in a steamer trunk, and sink it to the bottom of the bay.
you see, that's what I'm talking about.
you're nervous.
I'm not nervous.
I'm simply stating a fact: The man's a psychopath.
he wants to kill you, and you just want to just waltz right into his living room.
but, see, I've been around you long enough to know that, for you, that's pretty much par for the course.
still, you come along. You're like a.
mystery wrapped in a riddle wrapped in.
cashmere.
christopher Chance to see Mr. Bevilacqua.
are you some kind of moron, son?
I believe I made myself clear when last we spoke.
I know you've got ears.
best I can tell, the x-factor here is that you two idiots just don't listen.
and on that note.
take it away.
I need $1. 8 million in the next week, in cash.
get the steamer trunk and my 45 and bring 'em up here.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
just a loan.
you'll get every cent back, and, in the process, you'll get to stick it to the one guy in the world you hate worse than me.
which one?
just hang on a second.
keep talking.
I got a client.
prize fighter.
his name is Eddie Dunn.
Prentiss told him to take a dive. Eddie wouldn't do it.
Prentiss lost a fortune $1. 8 million, to be exact.
your client doesn't sound too smart.
I'll be honest with you.
he's not the brightest bulb in the box.
is he saying I'm dumb?
of course not.
I'm not dumb.
your headphones are on backwards.
but Eddie's a good kid.
Prentiss wouldn't even give him a chance to make it square.
just sent guys with guns to his house.
Eddie fought his way out, But he's been on the run ever since.
and what, exactly, do you think you're gonna do about that?
well, Prentiss has got deep pockets.
eventually, he's gonna find a way to get to my client.
but I got a plan to make sure that Prentiss never threatens Eddie or anyone else, ever again.
it's all in place. I just need the money to make it happen.
I'm still listening.
the Christof fight tournament in Brussels.
eight fighters, the best in the world.
betting room famous for the sums of money wagered.
fortunes won and lost in a night.
I'm gonna get Prentiss to make the wrong bet on the wrong fighter.
and he's gonna get wiped out.
you're gonna get Hugh Prentiss, the shrewdest gambler alive, to bet everything he's got and lose?
everything he owns.
every last dime.
and may I ask who this fighter is?
me.
all right. All right, let's say.
let's say you could win this tournament.
and that somehow, some way, you can actually convince Prentiss to bet every dime he owns against you.
you seem to be forgetting one small detail.
what's that?
the Christof is invitation-only, dummy.
why would they invite you?
step one of four.
concoct a hell of a story.
see, the organizers of this tournament, they kind of have a soft spot for guys who just come out of nowhere.
you know, unknowns.
so we're going to spread the word about an unknown named Grant Johnson who has run together a string of victories,
and then we're gonna plug Chance in and make the story real.
tonight?
here, in McGinty's Irish Pub?
Yeah, something like that.
Yeah, see, I know you guys are new at this, but to make a name for yourself, you gotta beat someone big.
to make a splash like you're talking, I can't imagine who you'd have to take down to do that.
holy.
that's Kendrick Taylor.
the guy's got, like, three MMA titles.
gold medal in Athens.
Ah, wish I had my camera.
anyway, what were we talking about?
Oh, right.
uh, beating someone with a big enough name to make an impression.
wait.
no.
spilled your drink.
you did it again.
okay, man, show him.
let's do it, huh?
come on, right now.
Kendrick Taylor's a wrecking machine.
you guys are picking a fight with him, and I'm an idiot?
watch this.
Hey, who is this guy?
Oh, it looks like, uh, Grant Johnson.
what, you never heard of him?
it's Kelso.
you'll never believe what I just saw.
how the hell did he just do that?
let me get this straight.
you know Kendrick Taylor, and you convinced him to let you kick his ass in public?
well, he's an old friend.
he's getting out of the fight business and.
he needs some help getting a liquor license to open his wine bar, so.
seemed like a fair trade.
you'll read about it in a month.
what's all this?
this is step two of four.
counterintelligence.
I don't know what that means.
spying, genius.
look, in order for this thing to come off, we gotta get Chance to the finals.
there's no limit on wagers then.
it's the only time Prentiss can bet everything.
now, getting Chance there means we need to learn everything we can about his opponents.
things they don't want us to know.
weaknesses.
chinks in their armor. That sort of thing.
now, you're gonna have to help us out with that, Eddie.
you up for it?
you really think Chance can win this thing?
there's nobody in the world I'd rather have in my corner.
I just got a call.
pack a bag.
we're going to Brussels.
6 hours before first fight
good evening, gentlemen.
may I help you?
Yes, we're with the Benedict party.
planning or implementation?
implementation.
please.
follow me.
fight check-in is at 7: 00 pm.
all right, tell me the truth.
are you as excited as I am?
you know, I haven't wanted to ask you this, but, um.
back there in the alley with Kendrick, that shot you took to the chin.
that wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
you caught that, huh?
Yeah.
you know, with all the jiu-jitsu crap that you do, how the hell do you get hit by accident in a staged fight?
I don't know.
just zigged when I should have zagged.
it happens.
you're about to step into this ring with some really heavy hitters, and it's Eddie's life that's riding on it.
so, listen, if you're not feeling up to it.
I'm good.
really good.
damn it!
all right, it looks like our first appointment's gonna be a fighter named Emil Lodan.
we're on it.
everybody's got a weakness.
we'll find Emil's.
Yeah, listen, just as a reminder -- I don't need a reminder.
Yeah, just as a reminder, Make sure you talk to Frank.
I called Frank.
did you talk to him?
I left word.
left word ain't gonna cut it.
hell, I can leave word. You know the guy.
listen, you gotta make sure that Frank's on board.
otherwise -- H-hello? he.
who's Frank?
Frank is step three.
the fight starts at 8: 00, so that should give you plenty of time to rest up before then.
good. That'll give us time to go over our cover story one more time.
I was only half-listening on the plane.
what?
it's better than not listening at all.
welcome, Mr. Johnson.
do you know who I am?
we let ourselves in. Hope you don't mind.
that's my physician, Dr. Weisz.
that's my security chief, Mr. Sams.
and that's Eva.
so.
what can we do for you?
I like to meet the participants.
it helps give me a sense of the event.
in your case, it seemed particularly worth the trip.
my case?
there's nothing more exciting than an unknown who makes a splash.
that's me.
all about the splashing.
your shirt.
all the participants submit themselves to a routine medical.
cause of your late entry, there wasn't time, But if you don't mind.
now, I may be overly skeptical, but, uh, I have to know
how does a fighter with your skill just appear out of thin air?
prison.
pelican Bay.
he did nine years for aggravated assault.
so you fought in the penal system, did you?
it's a wonderful recruiting ground.
tell me, how is Warden Torres?
she's fine.
as far as I know.
and you're his corner man, are you?
life coach I think is what they call it.
I've got a gym in the Tenderloin.
he came walking in my door one day, saying he wanted to put his past behind him.
you can put your shirt back on.
well, it was very nice to meet you gents.
good luck tonight.
Thanks.
nice meeting you.
all right, I got to get Guerrero hacked into the closed circuit camera network here.
life coach?
fan of the fights?
just here for the party.
your dad's Vincent Khan?
won this tournament back in the '80s, what, four times?
greatest heavyweight fighter nobody's ever heard of.
not bad.
Ah, I do my homework.
that's why I also know you're not Prentiss's arm candy.
you're the reason he's so good at picking winners.
you're his fight handicapper, aren't you?
again, not bad.
but I do my homework too.
wanna tell me why you've been running around with Eddie Dunn?
don't worry, I haven't said anything to Hugh, which, frankly, you ought to be thanking me for, because if even thought you knew where Eddie was, he'd be.
upset.
well, maybe upsetting Hugh is exactly what I want to do.
Eddie's made his bed. If I were you, I'd stay out of it.
Eddie's bed?
so Prentiss thinks you're pretty good at picking winners.
what do you think my chances are out there today?
honestly?
I think you're gonna lose.
all right, here's what we've got on Emil Lodan.
managed to dig up his army psychiatric records.
the guy's got serious anger management issues.
provoke him, he'll make mistakes.
fight!
try leading with your off-hand.
that usually pisses 'em off.
slap him. - Slap him?
what do you mean "slap him"?
Open-handed, in the face.
what are you talking about?
why would you want to slap -- What the hell's the matter with you?
Why? You angry?
Yeah, I'm angry. You just.
looks like Emil is good and angry.
Yeah, so far, so good.
once he's flustered, go for his weak spot.
he's got a pin in his wrist from a shattered ulna about a year ago.
and, uh, last May, he broke his third and fourth ribs, so.
one clean shot to those ribs, knock the wind right out of him.
then just finish him off.
what is "uh-oh"?
there's something not right with him.
I saw the same thing in the alley with Kendrick.
it's not like him.
he's looking slow.
he's not attacking.
break! - Damn it!
I'm calling this fight.
we're gonna need the ring doctor.
hang on a second.
there's no hanging on!
I'm looking right at him, and I just heard something pop!
I hope it's not his spine.
it wasn't.
think we just won the fight.
the pop you heard was Emil's wrist.
how do you know what a broken wrist sounds like?
practice.
look, dude, the top of the skull is the hardest part on the body.
chance leaned into that punch on purpose, and I bet it, uh, broke Emil's bad hand there.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I'm looking right at him, and he looks fine to me.
he's in pain, dude.
he's just not gonna show it.
if I'm right, Emil's done.
he can't defend himself at all.
and if you're wrong?
fight!
what the hell at happened to you out there?
you know, a couple more minutes of that stuff, and you'd be a human doorstop.
I know, it's like I forgot how to fight.
well, that doesn't make any sense.
sure it does.
he's got the yips.
if he goes back in that ring.
he's gonna get killed.
wait--wait a minute.
the yips?
what do you mean he's got the yips?
you know, like when a ballplayer hits a slump.
he's in his head.
all the parts that need to work aren't working.
double vision.
reaction time gone to pot.
weird, ringing noise, Like, uh, nails on a chalkboard, but in your head.
What'd you do about it?
Oh, I tried a bunch of things.
tried cutting out dairy.
my buddy told me to wear two right shoes.
I slept with my gloves on for a while.
like a year.
all right. You're an idiot.
Yeah, well, I don't like it.
you still got two more fights to win, and I don't think the next guy's gonna fall for "the break my hand over your skull" routine.
he's right.
if you go back in that ring, you're gonna get killed.
not sure where that leaves me.
just relax, Eddie.
nothing is gonna happen to you.
we got a good plan, and we're gonna stick to it.
I'm gonna go see Eva.
you guys are gonna work out a strategy for my next fight.
Guerrero, did you talk to Frank yet?
still waiting on a call back.
okay, well, Guerrero's gonna talk to Frank soon, and everything's gonna work out just fine.
this yips thing is probably just.
nerves.
nerves.
you ever known him to be nervous about anything?
final jeopardy questions.
volcanoes.
Yeah, well, I don't care what he says.
till this yips thing gets figured out, I'm not taking any chances.
we're gonna fix his next fight.
what?
and you call yourself a role model?
towel?
you shouldn't be here.
Why?'cause of your boss?
what's the story with you two, anyway?
hugh was a close friend of my father's.
I was nine when he died.
he took me in and raised me as his own.
what happened to your father?
he was sick.
doctors told him to stay out of the ring.
so did I.
but you know fighters.
the point is, I would do anything for Hugh, and I think you know that.
which is why you're here.
so cut the crap and ask me what you want to ask me.
Eddie doesn't deserve to die 'cause your boss doesn't like to play fair.
Prentiss listens to you.
help me convince him to cut Eddie loose.
what makes you think I would help you or Eddie?
I don't know. Just a hunch, maybe.
am I wrong?
Prentiss listens to me about betting on fighters, not about forgiving million-dollar debts.
let's make a bet.
I win this tournament, Prentiss lets Eddie go.
I lose, he gets all his money back, tonight
you're not serious.
$1. 8 million in cash.
I got it upstairs, if you want to see it.
I can't help Eddie Dunn.
and neither can you.
wait.
I told you earlier you would lose. Do you know how I knew that?
I could see it in your eyes.
you have that look like there's nobody at the wheel.
the yips.
call it what you want to call it, but they're real.
some guys never fight again because of it.
how do they happen?
in my experience, it's fear.
I'm not afraid.
you are, and until you find out of what or who, your problem's not going away.
I heard that fighter came to see you.
Yes.
What'd he have to say for himself?
nothing.
talking about the field. I think he was trying to hit on me.
what did he say that you don't want to tell me?
he's working with Eddie Dunn.
is that a fact?
he wants to strike a deal.
to get Eddie off the hook.
he says he has the money to cover your loss.
I think you should take it.
I'm just saying you get the 1. 8 back.
everyone gets to move on.
isn't that a good thing?
when someone makes a fool of you, you have to make an example of them.
otherwise, you just encourage that kind of behavior.
I know what I'm doing.
this is my business.
congratulations, Mr. Prentiss.
have that sent to my room, would you?
of course.
there's only a handful of people that would lend someone like Eddie that kind of money.
let's find out which one it is, shall we?
Yeah, hold on, damn it.
I'd like to speak with you about your fight today with Grant Johnson.
foster, my man, you've had a good run.
four championship boxing titles.
including the one they stripped from you on those trumped-up gambling charges.
but, you know, I think it's time that you asked yourself, how many more fights you got in you?
maybe it's time for you to explore some -- 25 million.
excuse me?
well.
you're buying me off, yeah?
trying to get me to throw the fight.
well.
Yeah, but-- 25 million.
I'm perfectly happy to take a fall.
but I'm not just gonna give it away.
25 million?
before the bell rings, in cash, in my hands.
tell you what I'm gonna do, Foster.
I'm gonna write down a number.
that way, you and me can negotiate -- No, no.
25, okay?
am I not speaking clearly?
how in the.
man, if I had $25 million, what would we be doing here in the first place?
well, that's your problem then, eh?
not mine.
can you get it or can't you?
Oh, come on, now. Wait a minute now.
you mean to tell me there's nothing else you want?
world peace.
Hey, time machine.
and to go down in history as the greatest boxer that ever lived.
tell him okay.
okay?
all right.
all right.
okay.
fight!
so this guy leaves the sport disgraced.
the commissioner himself says if Foster Larouche sets foot in the ring again, it'd be over his dead body, and you got him into the boxing Hall of Fame?
the commissioner and I have a relationship.
what kind of a relationship?
the kind where I get a monthly stipend.
certain photos stay stashed away in a drawer, and he stays happily married.
it's my understanding that you lent a significant amount of money to a fighter representing Eddie Dunn.
$1. 8 million, to be exact.
let's say I did. What of it?
well, I have a few problems with Mr. Dunn.
but I assume that, were I to interfere in his current plan, it might be difficult for the $1. 8 million to be paid back to you.
and then you and I would have a problem.
you would be correct.
so I'd like to buy the debt off.
150% of whatever you're owed.
that way, you get compensated, and I am free to deal with these gentlemen as I see fit.
175.0
and I assume that this check will be cleared by tomorrow morning.
Thanks, doll.
the fighter's real name is Christopher Chance.
he's all yours.
Hollis Ray versus Diego Cruz.
winner takes on you in the final match.
Oh, by the way, I overheard your conversation with Eva on the commlink.
you know, before she whipped your ass.
seriously, though, you give any thought to what she said?
you know, about what might be causing the yips?
that I'm afraid of something?
did you have something specific in mind?
well, that didn't take long.
not gonna lie to you.
this is probably the last guy you want to fight in this tournament.
what I dug up is not encouraging.
that's it?
born in Brazil.
served in the army.
guy's got no attachments.
no weaknesses.
there's nothing to exploit. I checked all over, man.
from what I can tell, all this guy does is eat, sleep, train, and fight.
and he knocked out Hollis Ray in ten seconds.
give us a minute, will you, fellas?
we need to start thinking seriously about backing out of this thing.
no.
we'll find someplace to stash Eddie and work out another way to neutralize the threat.
I promised Bevilacqua a result.
we can't walk away from this. The only way out of it is through.
they just took Ray out of here on a stretcher.
you want that to happen to you?
you're no good to Eddie right now.
this isn't about Eddie anymore.
who's it about?
the handicapper?
she's trapped.
Prentiss has pushed her around, taken advantage of her loyalty. He's used her.
it's wrong. I'm not gonna stand for it.
you're not gonna stand for it?
what the hell are you talking about?
she's not in any danger.
maybe not now, but someday she's gonna want to leave that guy.
do you think he's ever gonna let that happen?
you don't think he's always gonna be a problem for me?
a problem for you?
for her.
y-you know what I mean.
hello.
Hello?
okay.
Eva's coming around.
she wants to see me.
now, if you want to jump ship, you can be my guest.
but I'm sticking this out.
thank you for coming.
you said it was urgent.
Prentiss is wrong about Eddie.
but I can't change his mind.
I'm not strong enough.
so if you can't change his mind, why am I here?
no, no.
what he said was,"Prentiss is always gonna be a problem for me.
not for Eva. for me
so here's what I'm thinking.
now, it's gonna sound a little out there, so just hang with me.
you're saying it's a Freudian slip.
chance sees himself in Eva.
Prentiss uses her the same way his old boss used him.
what you actually think he's afraid of is a showdown with the old man, and that's what's causing the yips, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
Hey, how did you know what I was gonna-- It's not brain surgery, dude.
what are we talking about?
we?
we're gonna have to shake him loose.
that's great, Winston.
unfortunately, there's not a whole hell of a lot we can do about that now.
I'll call you back.
excuse me.
I need you to make a delivery for me, please.
thank you.
look, I get it. I know what you're going through right now.
he found you, he-- you were lost.
he dusted you off.
got you back on your feet. It meant something.
it meant everything.
he saved my life.
maybe.
but things are different now.
you didn't sign up to hurt people.
did you?
you should go. - Eva get out of here. Now
thank you.
I had a very informative conversation with Tony Bevilacqua.
Oh, that's great.
I'm glad you guys are working on your issues.
now, the good news is, You're no longer in debt to Mr. Bevilacqua. But that bad news is, you're in debt to me.
so, given this change in circumstances, I was wondering if you might answer a question for me.
where is Eddie Dunn?
well, that depends.
if you ask Descartes, he'd say that his mind and his body can exist in two places at the same time.
if you ask Jung, he'd say that he's in our unconscious realm.
keep asking whoppers like that, we're gonna be here for a while.
how long do you think you can keep that up?
[Panting] I don't know.
I guess we're gonna find out, won't we?
you tell me where Eddie is, it can all be done.
okay, pull him up.
you know, you might get out of this room.
might even get out of this hotel.
but sooner or later, I will find you.
and Eddie Dunn.
let's agree, we can both do each other a lot of damage.
take Eva, for instance.
what about Eva?
how do you think she'd feel if she knew that you had her father killed?
I don't know what you're talking about.
well, the doctor said it was heart failure, but you and I both know there are plenty of poisons that can mimic that.
especially in a fighter with a weakened system.
so what happened?
did he say no to you, just like Eddie did?
there are consequences to one's actions.
some people learn the hard way.
Yeah, somehow, I just don't think Eva's gonna see it that way.
Oh, well, I don't think Eva would believe you at all.
what if there were a way to resolve this and save us all this mess?
such as?
I fight Diego Cruz.
I win, Eddie doesn't see or hear from you ever again.
I lose, you get 1. 8 million and Eddie.
and if I say no?
like I said.
mess.
you got yourself a deal.
well, gentlemen.
if you'll excuse me.
I have a fight to get ready for.
so I'm confident in Mr. Cruz's chances, But, uh.
still, we don't want any surprises.
do you understand?
I understand.
you're fixing the fight?
hardly.
Cruz is going to win.
just guarding against the unforeseen.
then I suppose we ought to make some money on it.
place a bet.
whatever you think is appropriate.
did you hear about Ray?
they say he hasn't woke up yet.
they're saying Diego put him in a coma.
Yeah, I heard.
look, I'm just saying.
if, when you're out there, you feel like you need to bail at some point, you give me the signal. I'll pull the plug.
gentlemen, let's have a clean fight out there.
touch gloves.
this is a fight to the finish, gentlemen.
back to your corners.
no running out of the ring.
no head butts, eye-gouging, biting.
guess this is it, huh?
it's gonna be fine, right?
now stay in your corners until my signal.
fight!
I think I got an idea what's causing your yips.
something I heard Eddie say.
I know you're thinking about the old man.
that he's out there.
you think I'm afraid of him?
no, I don't think you're afraid of him at all.
matter of fact, I think that's a fight you've been looking for for a long time.
but, like any good fighter, you're thinking about where you're vulnerable.
where you'll be hurt.
I know you're not scared of the old man. I know that.
but you're thinking about what he might do to somebody close to you.
you're thinking about what he might do to me.
well, I got news for you.
I don't go down easy.
anybody wants to get at you, they're gonna have to go through me first.
come on, get up!
come on!
let's fight!
break!
I believe I'm supposed to be poisoning you now.
I'd rather you didn't.
say hi to Guerrero for me.
I will, Frank.
and fight!
what the hell is going on?
when you try to fix a fight by bribing the referee, you should probably make sure the ref isn't friends with the fighter you're trying to screw.
this is my business.
and I sure as hell know what I'm talking about.
you knew about this.
I know about a lot of things that I shouldn't.
delivery for you, ma'am.
what about Eva?
how do you think she'd feel if she knew that you had her father killed?
there are consequences to one's actions.
some people learn the hard way.
I know what you did to my father.
what's that?
it's the receipt.
from the bet that I placed on the fight.
you said that I should put down whatever I thought was appropriate.
how much did you -- all of it.
everything you own.
every last dime.
you'd better hope Diego wins.
Yes.
there are consequences to one's actions.
some people have to learn the hard way.
where do you think you're going?
don't worry about me.
worry about him.
well.
that was unexpected.
you assured me this check would clear.
something tells me that may not be the case.
we have a new champion!
ladies and gentlemen, the new champion!
you told Bevilacqua that you'd get Prentiss to bet everything he owns.
but, really, your plan was to get Eva to make the bet.
step four.
step four?
which means you knew all along that Prentiss killed her father.
Yep.
which means I can go home?
hug me, dude, and you're a dead man.
listen, what you said back there.
Thanks.
you want to know why I come with you on these things?
it's not because I'm nervous.
it's not because I want to second-guess you, and it's definitely not because I'm some sort of.
closet thrill junkie.
I come with you on these things because.
you know.
for god's sakes, get a room already.
Oh, shut up.
I figured you're heading to the airport.
mind if I hitch a ride?
where you headed?
I'm open to suggestions.
Yeah, I'll just ride up in.
Taxi!
isola TANARAK, ALASKA I'M ALONE NOW. .
I'm cut off. .
nowhere to run. .
I had to do this. .
I had to try. .
I'm afraid it's all going to end and end quietly. .
[siren wails] I'm afraid I'm never going to get out of the wilderness here. .
I'm AFRAID I'VE FAILED. .
they're after me. send help. .
after I got this message,
I kept trying to call her back.
then I called the sheriff.
but after her message
you don't know who to trust.
[siren wails] Dr. shaw.
I was worried about you speeding like that
something were to happen to you, why, we'd be up a creek.
sorry. I've got an emergency appendectomy on the mainland.
now what's in the back?
since JESSIE WAS A CHILD,
the more in need someone was, the more she wanted to help.
first, it was that e. r. in chicago.
Poi...
then doctors without borders in east africa.
kabul, Kosovo.
Mrs. shaw, I've got to be honest with you. We've never worked in that part of the world
now, I don't know what detective simms told you about the way we operate, but-- he said you were the best, and he said that if it were his child, you'd be the only people he'd trust to help.
what do we have here?
Yeah, I thought I'd take the body to county while I was there, get the autopsy started.
I don't think the company's gonna like that very much.
they keep trying to tell me she's lost.
Jessica's not lost.
I know my daughter.
she can handle herself.
[engine starts and revs] [tires squeal] Let's go!
get down there. I want bodies, both of them.
agrius industries?
$16. 2 Billion in sales last year.
industrial hardware, agriculture, biotech, and apparently a small mining operation in tanarak, alaska.
about three hours after jessica's voice mail, the company made an announcement that they were going to be doing a heavy blasting around the mines and restricting access to the island.
so you think they're keeping people away while they hunt for her?
that's the way I read it
so why would a big company like that mess around with a small-time country doctor?
well, jessica's mother said that the company reps have been hassling her about the death of a mine foreman.
something about trying to prevent an autopsy.
autopsy? was he murdered?
you know, that's what's strange.
I looked into it.
the guy actually did die of a heart attack.
no foul play whatsoever suggested. That's weird. yeah.
okay, the island.
400 Square miles, mostly forest surrounding the mine.
one access road to the mainland here, which they've closed ????
which is going to be very difficult since we don't have any friends like that up there.
he's on it.
[Sighs] What can I say? he likes your desk.
look, I don't know how he does what he does and I don't give a damn, ...but up there in alaska, it's completely insulate.
you're not from there, you can't get in - You don't think he can do it? - No, no. I really don't.
I'll tell you what. Just stay here, work the corporate angle.
it's a big company, somebody has to know something and how we can stop it.
who is paul woodruff?
alaska bureau of land and mine development.
guy's been on leave for a couple of months, so you're him for the next 48 hours. enjoy.
thank you. you're welcome.
and paperwork will be in the car waiting for you when you land
well, I got a plane to catch. You two let me know what you find.
later, dude...
don't you want to know how I did it? - No!
no?
maybe.
[Scoffs] Hey!
you remember what I said about that place.
they don't like strangers, so don't go up there screwing around or nothing.
just blend in and keep a low profile.
.It's me.
Yeah.
[Shuts off music] Can I help you, sir?
????
I've been driving so long, I figured I should be halfway to moscow by now.
wsa that a joke
Yeah. .
Yeah, it was.
paul woodruff, bureau of land and mine management.
I heard you had some heavy blasting going on down at the mine, shut the island down.
Yes, sir, until the wind blows out the dust and debris.
right, well, unfortunately someone forgot to tell my office about that, so would it be possible to get some of this out of the way for me?
you just wait right there.
Yeah, it's me.
Yeah, I got a guy down here.
his name's paul woodruff.
the bureau of land and mine management. He wants to drive onto the island.
he's HERE NOW??
yeah
damn. all right. Have big mike take him in. okay, yeah.
got it.
I'm gonna have to provide you with an escort onto the island.
great. who am I following?
you're going to be driven to the site directly.
we wouldn't want to scratch up this nice new camaro of yours.
we stopping for any particular reason? ?
unit one, come in.
go AHEAD.
got EYES ON A SMOKE COLUMN About 800 yards east of our position.
copy that. get out there and report back.
Oh, you're looking for somebody. . I thought the island was evacuated.
lost touch with a surveyor yesterday.
need me to file a report?
sit in the car, don't go anywhere, don't touch anything.
I'll be back.
what are you using that for?
bears.
what are you, like, 6'3," 220?? You train? martial arts, anything like that?
wing chun. black belt.
bet you're pretty good at it.
you don't want to find out. trust me.
Hi. I'm christopher chance.
your mom sent me.
my mom? yeah.
you're not one of them? Would we still be talking if I were?
so what was in the syringe?
morphine.
interesting. Next time, you might just want to leave it empty.
air bubble in the jugular is lethal in seconds.
I think I know what putting an air bubble in the jugular does.
I went to school for quite some time to learn how not to do it.
so what are you, a cop?
not exactly.
well, not at all, really.
your mom hired me to get you off the island.
Oh, I see.
you're a mercenary.
there's a truck up by the side of the road with the keys still in the ignition.
if you want to get to it while it can still do us some good, I suggest that we get moving.
any idea why they're after you?
your patient, the guy who died?
Yeah, he was a mine foreman.
last time I came through tanarak, he complained of labored breathing and some rash he couldn't explain, so I diagnosed it as allergies and gave him an antihistamine.
then, last week, I get a call.
Hank had dropped dead of a pulmonary embolism.
doesn't sound right.
really doesn't.
made no sense based on what he presented to me when I first examined him.
so I scheduled an autopsy with the mainland.
24 Hours later, company men show up telling me...
they want agrius to handle the autopsy.
why didn't you let them??
a man had died in my care.
a man with a wife...
three children...
and I couldn't explain to them what happened
I don't get to just walk away from that. I owed it to them.
when the company kept pressuring me really hard, it became pretty clear that whatever hank had died of, they didn't want it coming to light.
I couldn't let that happen.
I guess that sounds ridiculous.
???
a mercenary with a heart of gold??
I prefer death-retardant specialist.
you okay??
I'm fine. . I just want to get out of here.
you never explained how you got into town.
don't they have the roads blocked off?? - They sent me in with an escort.
what happened to him??
all right, .
whoever he is, he's good.
tracks head this way towards this small trail.
last RADIO COMMUNICATION Was ten minutes ago. .
that gives him quite a head start.
top speed's a couple miles per hour
all right, I want cahill's team from the south Thompson's from the east.
let's tighten the noose.
all RIGHT, WINSTON, I got into the company's phone records.
we're gonna go sing happy birthdayto janis - There's cake too. . - Sweet. thanks, man.
all right, at any rate, 12 hours ago, a call came in from tanarak island, alaska, to jason banneker.
that's the agrius ceo.
so this thing goes to the top?
Yep.
okay, after they hung up, who did the ceo call??
banneker placed two outgoing calls.
first went to his attorney.
well, that makes sense. second?
second ...
one went to an internal number at agrius.
that's weird... - What? ?
second one went to the head of research and development.
a guy named dr. david patel.
you got a problem in a mining town in nowhere, alaska.
why the hell would you call some egghead in r&d?
that's a good question.
probably worthskin the egghead directly.
Nah, them guys never talk. agrius owns them.
quitter.
I don't give up so easily, dude.
I'll take care of dr. patel.
listen, I gotta run.- I'll see you later.
Hey. Hey, thanks, man
Hey, do you actually work here?
no.
???
is there a plan for that?
Yes, there is.
drive down to the marina, borrow a fishing boat, and sort this out on the mainland.
I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but is there any way that plan works without anyone else getting killed? Ideally.
I've worked in afghanistan and--and rwanda and I've seen a lot of people killed and I'm a physician and I just would prefer it not be on my behalf.
let's go. now. - But I thought the truck
truck's no longer an option. come on.
there they are.
[gunfire] Stay here.
when I fire, head that way.
but it's a dead end. - Trust me.
[Panting] OH, GOD.
Oh, god. oh.
okay, so we just-- we just make them think that we jumped.
Yeah. yeah. okay, how
by jumping.
what? are you insane?? We're never gonna make that
no, I mean, probably. definitely
there they are!
on the count of three... - oh, god.
isn't THAT WHAT GOME IN TROUBLE In the first place ?
what got you in trouble is you never had a masai warrior chief teach you how to build a smokeless fire.
and you have?
dry twigs, no air underneath the tender.
it's a little more art than science, but once you get the-- the hang of it
you should take off yours too...
the dock is six to seven miles from here, and wet clothes in this temperature
we're gonna face hypothermia halfway there.
okay.
shouldn't take long to dry those things out.
in the meantime, better make sure we keep our core temperature from going down too fast.
[shivers] YEAH, WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE Of whatever we have available.
our body heat.
that's what I was gonna-- yeah.
I just want you to understand that it's-- .
Oh, yeah, completely practical
I agree.
Hey, dude. mission accomplished.
you called. you said you had the guy.
Yeah. - Yeah.
Where's the guy?
what is wrong with you?
what?
tried asking him nicely.
can I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
please.
rwanda, afghanistan, alaska
what's your story??
well, there's a lot of doctors in san francisco.
the places I've been, you're lucky if the hospitals have four walls, let alone doctors...
do I feel like I'm pushing the same boulder up the same hill?
some days.
but I'm making a difference.
what else?
that isn't enough?
well, I've just met a lot of docs in a world tour of hot spots, but I haven't met one who seemed like they're trying to get lost or leave something behind.
I doubt you're the first.
I swore an oath to help people who needed it without any regards to what I was getting out of it.
I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand that.
someone like me?
I've known a lot of mercenaries from my world tour, and I haven't met one yet who wouldn't sell out whatever cause he was fighting for if the price was right.
somehow I doubt you're the first
we should probably get going.
yeah [streetcar bell chimes] Here you go, doctor.
sorry about, you know, him.
are you going to kill me?
no.
then what's he doing with my phone?
patel, I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions.
a week ago, you were on a phone call with the ceo of agrius industries.
I need to know what that phone call was about.
I can't talk about that. I've got non-disclosures, a confidentiality agreement -- wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hey, hey. come on, man.
a mine foreman died a few days ago in tanarak, alaska
not a cave-in. not a mishap. Not an accident. not foul play.
now, ever since then, agrius industries has been doing everything in its power to make sure the cause of this man's death is kept a secret, including trying to kill his doctor.
now I believe the phone call you were on is connected to that in some way, and I need to know how.
5 o 6 years ago...
agrius patented a chemical called propalyde.
what is it?
it's a ticking time bomb.
sector five is clear.
get ON TO THE HARBOR. No boat leaves the island without my okay.
copy that.
let's see if I can get ahold of my partner
a cell phone's not gonna work. The towers are down
we'll go straight to the satellite. how?
dial 415-555-0112.
on STAR DIALING NOW.
please hold.
[Phone trilling] Where the hell are you?
we're ON OUR WAY TO THE HARBOR.
I've got jessica.
well, that's good.
what's the problem?
I don't know if you're gonna be able to get out.
what are you talking about?
when jessica tried to leave with that body, it set off all kinds of alarms at agrius about something called propalyde.
Yeah, it's an industrial solvent.
it's got a lot of uses, including mining, and it's a hell of a lot more toxic than anyone cares to admit.
that's what killed hank.
well, if it is, . his death could be the first in what could amount to a billion-dollar tort against agrius
they gotta contain it.
they gotta erase any evidence that it was on the island before it gets out.
but right now, I'm the only evidence that's left.
what if we got other proof?? Evidence that her patient was exposed to this chemical?
like what?
??? proves he had exposure.
that plus the doctor who treated him could tell a pretty convincing story...
will it be enough?
it's gonna have to be.
if we get to the boat and we're off the island
this doesn't end, does it?
you know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to stop them.
if you can keep pushing, other dominoes will fall.
they can't contain this and they know it, and they're never gonna stop coming after you unless we stay.
we get the proof we need to expose their cover-up.
[Sighs] These people have done enough.
I'm gonna see this end...
. for good.
there's an airfield near the mine.
who do we know that can get a plane to the ground within four hours??
four hours' notice to get you out of a hot zone with a professional kill squad shooting at you?
nobody you'd want to-- what about that guy from seattle, fred something?
Frank. deceased.
Harris from calgary?
also deceased.
what about that flight instructor from coeur d'alene?
the one with the glass eye?
yeah - He's too far away and.
, you know, dead
maybe I could
you know what?
you be at that airstrip in four hours. I'll figure something out.
okay, check the desk, look for work schedules, call logs, anything that might have hank's name on it.
how do we know they haven't destroyed everything that has his name on it??
we don't.
Oh! what?
what? I'm starving.
Mm. oh, work schedule.
Hank benson. shaft 183.
OK, 183. It's on the eastern slope.
come ON, DOCTOR.
no lab work? no tissue samples? Not even a damn memo?
look, I'm telling you, the records of our propalyde testing were just cleared out of our offices.
I was told it was to arrange for safe storage.
but who knows where it went?
there is nothing that can document any of this documentare l'intera faccenda.
listen to me. If we don't get something that proves the company knew about propalyde, we're never going to be able to get the kind of leverage we're going to need over them.
this number appears in your call logs four times over the last seven days
there's no name. who is it?
tell me the truth.
his name is jon taggart.
that's what I figured.
who is jon taggart?
he's a fixer.
corporate espionage Evidence scrubber.
agrius definitely hired this guy to make the evidence go away on propalyde.
so what did he say to you when he talked to you last?
??? That sort of thing? am I close?
Yeah, that's exactly what he said.
yeah you know this prson?
Yeah, he's kind of a shark.
no real code. a real sleazebag.
I'm sorry.- You sayhe's a real sleazebag?
Yeah. - Oh, got you.
but if we can get to him, he'll have the evidence we need.
any idea what this propalyde stuff looks like?
no.
all we know is that it killed your patient? - Pretty much.
should we be worried about th
well, hank was exposed to high doses over a month or two.
we'll be fine.
not sure I believe you, but I do like your style.
is this how it really works?
shovel a crime into a deep, dark hole, hope nobody finds out about it?
happens more than you think.
here
this wood is new
whoever closed it was in a hurry. qui andava di fretta.
obviously they beat us here.
I don't understand.
why didn't she try to make it off the island?
why'd she come here?
she's looking for proof.
mine shaft 183, we finish pre-rigging it to blow?
Yeah. good. - Send howe and stanton to the entrance.
make sure no one gets out
let's put an end to this.
if this is it, they didn't do a very good job of hiding it.
maybe they're not done.
all right. we've gotta get out of here. We've gotta get to that airfield.
[Alarm sounds] What is that?
that's a pre-blast warning.
but the exit's that way. not anymore.
are u ok?
I think so
I suppose u dont know a way out of here do u?
we should find a loose rock that we can move.
o God. - wat?
its just a scratched back in there - well u think.?
OK, sit down
now!
sorry
just wait a second.
we're gonna have to pull this one out h, it's not that bad, is it? It'll just work itself out.
what is this? is this bullet wounds?
yeah
this one looks like barbed wire
no.
no, wait. yes.
Sarajevo.
I--I don't even know what this one is.
Oh, that's a masai ngulu blade.
Seriously?
in chicago, um, I had a patient named jose ortega
acute liver failure.
I knew how to treat him, but the hospital and the hmo, they kept pushing me to find a cheaper way out.
I was the only one standing between him and them
and you caved.
I let myself be talked into it.
I believed them when they said they wanted what was best for him.
I swore from then on I would never walk away .
no matter the cost.
Ngulu blade's a lot easier to get over.
[Chuckles] How would you know?
cause I've been there too.
sorry.
for what?
[Grunts] Thank you.
[Hissing] You hear that?
that hissing?
Yeah.
the explossion must be...
severed one of the vent pipes.
what's it venting? - Good question.
it must be carbon monixide [coughs] it's collecting up here.
there's no other way out.
[Coughs] NOT YET.
whoa. hey, taggart.
been a while.
what?
Oh, yeah. I get it.
I mean, I could be recording this, right?
if I were you, I wouldn't say a word either.
so here's the deal.
I know you're working with agrius
you're scrubbing evidence over this whole propalyde mess.
and I also know, dude, even if you destroyed it all, you kept one folder for yourself.
the one with the really good stuff in it.
the one that guarantees you get paid on time, they never mess with you
problem is this.
this company's going down, bro.
I think we both know there's no reason for you to be anywhere near it when it does.
don't you think?
what's in it for you?
how about doing the right thing?
I know where you live and you know it.
Tom's diner.
19th and pine.
just leave the folder in the back booth by the can.
all right? Tell your wife I said hi.
see you, taggart.
[coughing] What are you doing?
carrying an acetylene tank.
I realize that. where?
map says there's a tie-in to another mine shaft???
okay, but it's still wall.
if we're lucky, not for long. Come on.
[Coughs] Get down.
what the hell was that?
sounded like a secondary explosion.
give me the map.
what are you looking for?
how I'd get out if I were him.
here
I need eyes on shaft 192, primary and secondary exits.
go! go!
[coughing] No. no. not another cliff.
it's just a little one. come on. - No. ooh!
[SCREAMS] See? it's not so bad.
[gunfire] Get down!
chance, the other side!!
[Groaning] Come on. we're going.
going? going where?
[Explosion] Who the hell are you?
Aw, that doesn't matter. I know who you are, though.
you're jason banneker, ceo of agrius industries.
it says it in this too.
Where'd you get these?
it's all gonna come out at your trial.
come on, jason. You knew what happened to that miner.
you knew propalyde was toxic and then you hid it.
so here's how it's gonna go for you and agrius.
you're gonna get raked over the coals.
your stock price is going right in the crapper.
fines.

[whistles] Good boy.
I'm not playing games here. Don't threaten me.
I'm not afraid of you people.
I know what this is really worth.
how much longer is this gonna take?
I'm trying to conduct business here.
I just got to get a part out of the van, Mr. Brooks.
we'll be all set.
you take care of it?
not yet.
listen, are you sure about this target?
you're the only guy in the business who asks these kinds of questions.
Brooks got himself into this mess.
that's all you need to know.
don't call me again till it's done.
so don't threaten me.
prensent Day
yoga crap again, huh?
I told you, it's tai chi.
there's a guy on the phone, says he's an old friend of yours--Donnelly.
yeah?
so when was the last time you been in there?
about seven years ago. Things haven't changed much.
same charming clientele, huh?
that's pretty safe to say.
ain't nothing safe about that place.
are you worried about me?
I'm just saying, that place, those people that's part of your past.
don't you think it's better you kept it there?
it's just a conversation.
so who's this Donnelly guy?
just a guy. - Yeah, but a bad guy, right?
See,'cause that's a bad-guy bar, so he must be a bad guy.
are you coming? It's your last chance.
hell, no.
I hate bad guys.
you don't write. You don't call.
way to make an old buddy feel forgotten.
I haven't forgotten anything.
so what's so important that I got to be here right away?
this just came down.
it's got a lot of heat on it.
you know I don't do that kind of work anymore.
it's not that side of the job, Chance.
they already hired somebody to do the hit, and he's the best in the business you, seven years ago.
why are you giving me this?
I knew you'd be interested, that's all.
might want to fix it.
if you can't save her, nobody can.
tell me everything you know about this job.
you know I can't give you anything else.
I'd be a dead man, if I'm not already.
the only thing I can say is it goes down soon real soon.
you torch the place, I hope?
we're taking the case, starting right now.
okay, what are the details? - I don't know.
then why is she being targeted? - I don't know.
okay, so you want to tell me why we're taking this case?
seven years ago...
I killed her husband.
when I scan in this photo, we should be able to get a full I. D.
Aw, any idea how one would scan a photo into this fancy, expensive computer that Ilsa bought us?
look at this thing.
I wonder if there's a manual for the manual.
all right, two hits called in, one on each spouse, seven years apart.
they got to be connected. We just got to figure out how.
Yeah, well, it would be helpful to know who hired you back then.
I got my assignments from Donnelly or the old man.
I never knew who ordered the hits.
I just made sure that the target was in the game.
I didn't have any details on their personal lives.
I didn't even know this guy was married.
Rebecca Brooks, age 35.
renowned Economics Professor at Northern Cal university.
husband, Daniel also Northern Cal.
economics Professor. - Economics?
not exactly a life-threatening career choice.
she's got a few of these social-networking accounts, a couple dating services.
Ugh, not for me.
I get my dates the old-fashioned way.
pay for it? - Church.
who's the dude?
you're drunk.
you're not wearing your glasses.
they fell into a meat grinder.
new pair won't be ready until tomorrow.
so I got your message.
Where'd the new case come from? Donnelly brought it in.
what's his angle?
well, he claims he's trying to save the woman, but he won't give up who called in the hit.
I think you might have to lean on him a little bit.
all right.
Hey, profile says she's got a date today at the Berkeley diner, 12: 00 noon.
if we could find this this easily, so can an assassin.
all right, I'm gonna go to the diner, get there early, pretend to be her date, get her out of there, and try to explain what's going on.
I will quarterback from the van.
chance, I know this is important to you, but I don't trust Donnelly, so don't do anything crazy.
who, me?
what about me?
obviously I can't drive the Eldo in this condition.
who's gonna take me to Donnelly?
I dig your car, by the way.
Cadillacs are so rock and roll.
I'll forget more about Cadillacs when I go to sleep tonight than you'll ever know in your entire life.
relax.
so where am I taking you the dentist, pottery class, what?
I'm going to see a broker.
what, like a stockbroker?
like an assassination broker.
a go-between for hit men and people who want something dead.
he's in Drake's Bar 820 Geary Street.
yeah? - Yes, it is.
you are not going in not ready.
are you serious? I'm not ready?
I have been hustling on the streets
look, I don't want to hear your bad-girl resume, okay?
you're not going in 'cause you're J. V.
the guys in there are varsity. Eyes on the road.
Mrs. Pucci.
Mr. Winston, I'm glad I caught you.
I was reviewing the company books, and there's a few things I'd like to discuss with you.
walk with me to my office.
um, I thought you were gonna be in Hong Kong for a week.
Yes, I was.
it went better than expected, so here I am.
let's take advantage.
now, firstly, how's the new equipment?
good. Complex, but...
Yes, I wasn't sure about weapons.
I figured I'd let you order them, and then I'll reimburse you.
I've got a catalog from a friend in Israel.
you don't see any need for a tank, do you?
not immediately.
listen, could we talk about this later?
I'm just heading out. - Oh, on a job?
um, yeah, I-I'll be back soon. I won't be gone long.
Oh, well, fabulous. Well, I'll come with you.
what better way to learn about how you operate than on-the-job training?
um, Mrs. Pucci,
I'd be more than happy to walk you through our organization some other time.
but right now we're on assignment.
lives are at stake.
Yes, I understand perfectly well what the stakes are when we are on a job.
now, tell me, where are you going?
to run surveillance for Chance.
listen, what happened to all that absentee-owner jazz?
the new surveillance van comfortably seats seven.
you won't even know I'm there.
Mrs. Pucci, these jobs we go on can get more than a little messy.
you've been through a lot lately.
are you sure you can handle something like this right now?
luckily, I'm an employer that appreciates her staff's unfiltered opinions.
so thanks for that.
and in answer to your question, yes, I'm quite sure I can handle this.
come along.
I'm on scene.
I got eyes on Rebecca.
she's still solo. You got that information yet?
here's the profile he sent her.
the date's name is Kevin Heller.
he's a doctor at Marin General six feet tall, dark hair.
chance looks nothing like that man.
how's he gonna pull this off?
is that Ilsa?
Yes, the boss is back in town, wanted to join us and see how we work.
let's keep that in mind, shall we?
why is someone trying to kill her?
don't know yet.
she's wearing a wedding ring in this photo.
but she's on a blind date. Is she divorced?
as a matter of fact, uh, her husband was murdered several years ago.
Oh, I see.
stay focused, Chance.
we got to get her out of there, remember?
Rebecca? Hi, I'm Kevin.
you are?
Yeah. That online photo it's from a while ago.
it's when I used to dye my hair.
I hope you're not disappointed.
no, no, not at all.
good. This is kind of new to me this Internet dating.
Oh, God, I know.
this is my first time, actually.
Really? Me too.
all right, come on, come on, come on, come on.
kind of a crazy thing... I have this doctor friend, he said he got food poisoning here.
obviously I probably shouldn't have recommended the place, so...
I recommended it. - Oh, yes...
but I agreed with you, so...
I was wondering if you're into going to some other place maybe Theodore's up in North Berkeley?
Rebecca? I'm Kevin.
if you're Kevin, who are you?
look, I'm sorry.
I saw your profile. I really wanted to meet you.
so... Uh, what's going on?
it's all too weird for me.
I think I'm just gonna go.
nice to almost meet you.
Winston, we got our guy.
he's the assassin? Where's he headed?
wait, Rebecca.
don't take one more step towards me, or I will call the cops.
you're in danger.
listen to me. Stay away from me.
get in! Get in now!
what is happening?
who are you? - I'm saving your life.
internet dating it's crazy, huh?
give us a second, Mrs. Brooks.
so is there any I. D. on the assassin?
no, there was no trace of him by the time we reached the parking garage.
why is she in there alone?
I was just in there.
Mrs. Brooks, my name's Ilsa Pucci.
I just wanted to see how you were doing.
how am--how am I doing? I'm freaking out.
what-- what is this place?
I don't know what is going on, - and somebody just tried to kill me. - I know.
and you must feel very frightened right now.
you have no idea how I feel!
very recently, Mr. Chance and his team helped protect me after my husband died.
I saw them work.
it's why I'm financing this company.
these men...
they saved my life.
his name's Christopher Chance.
and you can trust him.
I still don't understand exactly what's going on here, but I-I suppose I owe you a thank-you.
well, you can thank us when you're out of danger for good.
Mrs. Brooks, we believe that the attempt on your life today is directly connected with your husband's murder.
I don't understand.
my--my husband was killed in a robbery.
I'm afraid that's not what we think.
can you think of any reason why someone would have targeted your husband?
targeted?
no, of course not.
m-my husband was an Economics Professor.
what was he working on when he was killed.
w-we share the same pretty obscure specialty...
predictive economics.
and, um, his last project was a fairly minor theory.
he loved baseball, and he was working on a formula to predict price changes for ballpark tickets.
I mean, it was certainly nothing to kill for.
he didn't even finish it.
you still have a copy of it?
no.
but I-I just applied for a Grant to complete it, to finish it in his memory.
that's what set this in motion.
somebody found out you're going to finish this paper.
where are your husband's papers now, Mrs. Brooks?
all Daniel's work is kept at the university archives.
I was gonna take it out this week.
well, we've got to get them out now.
there's something in that theory worth killing for.
Donnelly, dude, how are you?
still drinking in the middle of the afternoon, I see.
you know what? Good for you.
liver's pickled anyway, right?
I told Chance everything I know.
Yeah, I heard that.
real bro move of you too. Thanks for that.
no problem.
sure you didn't forget anything?
positive.
okay.
good enough for me.
so I hear you're interested in switching teams, then, huh?
coming over to work for Chance?
Guerrero, don't do this.
if I say anything else, I'm dead, and you know it.
the way I see it, dude, it's either you or Rebecca Brooks.
she's cuter.
tell me who ordered the hit now, or I'll tell everybody in this bar you're playing both sides.
then I go over to your daughter's apartment.
she's still over on Ellis, right?
how long did you expect me to sit out there?
who the hell are you?
I told you to wait in the car.
I'm not your dog. I'm your girlfriend.
now, uh, go get me a cocktail, introduce me to your friend, and, uh, start acting like you're the luckiest guy in this bar.
leave Now.
I guess my mother was right about you.
I was just about to get the info.
I figured whoever he's been talking to has got to be in his recent calls, right?
we could just do a reverse search on the list,
I. D. the contact.
let's be clear about something.
I was just about to get him to tell me the name of his contact, which, by definition, would have been faster.
maybe, but, uh, I just got the guy's number.
I'm just saying that...
drive.
we're at the university, Winston, heading in now.
all right. Working on the feed.
stand by.
how are you able to have access to the university security feeds?
you hack in.
well, I assume that's illegal.
that an issue?
halls are clear to the archives.
restricted access? - Because of the archives.
damn it. - What?
it's just--just the clerk on duty--Harrison.
he's very nice, but he tends to be incredibly chatty.
he's been asking me out since Daniel died.
we don't have much time for small talk.
maybe I should just go in and talk to him.
no, no, no. It'll--it'll--it'll be fine.
professor Brooks... Hi. Hello.
um, I haven't seen you in a while.
Harrison, I-I was wondering if you could get me the bin number for Daniel's papers.
Yeah. Can do.
it seems Professor Brooks had his papers shipped out July 9, 2003.
that's right before he died.
Where'd he ship them to?
Ooh, uh, I'm-- I'm sorry.
I can't give that information out without written approval.
Harrison, listen to me-- Rebecca...
let me just have a word with Harrison.
so, Harrison,
I'm not really a friend of Mrs. Brooks.
I'm actually an insurance adjuster.
I'm here to settle some of her husband's affairs.
now, she told me you guys were close.
so I was thinking maybe you could help her out, just give us that address.
she said we were close?
don't tell anyone.
8564 Belvedere Road, Tiburon.
that's a family home outside the city, where we used to spend weekends before Daniel died.
that's where he was killed.
we got a name off Donnelly--some lawyer.
we're heading his way now.
lawyer... what firm?
not a firm, it's an investment bank...
small and very private.
it's got to be the same people that hired Chance to kill Rebecca's husband.
chance killed her husband?
that's why we're involved in this case?
and she has no idea?
Winston, I told her she could trust him.
she can.
protecting her life is the only thing that matters to him right now.
chance, he's headed right for you.
he's right around the corner.
get down.
Harrison, get down!
where is he? He's right on your tail.
you got to get him off you. He's way too close.
where am I?
what's around me? What can I use?
end of the hall, your left, there's a chem lab.
okay.
you guys should probably get out of here. Now!
grab this extinguisher, right there.
come on.
chem lab's straight ahead.
he came down this way.
okay, okay, keep moving.
keep moving.
keep moving.
last door on your right is an exit.
hold it. Stop! Stop.
come on, we got to try and sneak past them.
you okay? - Not really.
Hey, listen, you were amazing up there.
all we got to do is get through this door, and we're in the car, okay?
seeing that man...
knowing he could be the one who killed my husband...
maybe you're right. Maybe I can't handle this.
you have to believe me.
I don't know anything about any hit man or this "books" woman you keep mentioning.
Brooks. - What?
her name is Brooks, Rebecca Brooks.
did I tell him "books"? I don't think so.
is that a common stall tactic...
pretending like they were told a different name?
it happens occasionally.
go get my tackle box out of the car.
it's in the exceptionally roomy trunk.
tackle box? Yeah.
this is... this is crazy!
I don't know anything!
I am a lawyer at an investment bank, for God sakes!
a lawyer and an investment banker?
I'm really gonna enjoy this.
have any allergies I should know about?
okay, okay.
look, uh...
all I know is that this, uh--this woman...
Mrs. Brooks? Yeah, yeah.
her husband was blackmailing the firm.
what did he have on them?
what's it got to do with his wife?
I don't know.
all I was told is that she'd be dealt with. Okay.
are you stupid or something?
seriously, are you one of those guys from Harvard who can't tie his own shoes?
do you have any idea who this man is?
what Jay-Z is to rap, what Louis Vuitton is to luggage, he is to torturing the truth out of people.
you done?
you might want to save the speeches for Malcolm X.
okay.
we'll find out what he knows if you go get my stuff out of the car.
damn it!
a simple thank-you would suffice!
what do you mean somebody shot him? Who?
don't know, dude.
the only thing we got is that the woman's husband was blackmailing the bank where the lawyer worked.
whoever popped the lawyer sure did have some good timing.
Yeah, a little too good, if you ask me.
all right, call me if you get anything else.
what's happened?
the lawyer's dead.
I don't understand. What does that mean?
where are you going? - To find him.
chance is in trouble.
I got to figure out what's going on.
Yes, but it's his trouble, isn't it?
let's be honest here, Mr. Winston.
isn't that why he's involved in the first place...
because of what he did to her, to her husband, to all of them?
all due respect, Mrs. Pucci, but you knew about Chance's past when you decided to work with us.
I told you these things get messy.
and not just the logistics, but that's how it is.
that's how it is for Chance, for me, for all of us.
and you're right.
his past is the reason why he's on this case.
it's also the reason why he'd gladly let himself get killed to protect Mrs. Brooks, but I can't let that happen.
understand?
when this is over, you'll have to tell her.
and if you don't, I will.
Hey, let me tell you something.
when this is over, if Chance is even alive...
he'll tell her.
Daniel's grandfather built this house.
listen, I know this is tough, but the sooner we can get in there and find whatever it was your husband was working on, the sooner you can put whatever it was that happened to you behind you...
for good.
do you know if he hs a separate filing cabinet?
Rebecca, I need you to focus.
I need your help here. Whoever this assassin is, he's probably on his way here.
here?
but you sa--how do you know that?
cause it's what I would do.
in this business, it pays to assume whoever's after you is at least as smart as you are.
there's an attic here. Is it sealed?
I don't... I don't think so.
let's check it out.
I-I don't ever remember being up here.
what's your birthday? - August 3rd. Why?
a gun?
Why--why would he have a gun?
Mrs. Pucci, I'm a nice man, but everyone has a breaking point, and you're about to see mine.
Mr. Winston, as the owner of this agency,
I'm just as responsible for Mr. Chance's actions as he is.
so I suggest you start driving, especially if he's in as much danger as you say he is.
what are you waiting for?
I swear, if you wasn't my boss, I'd shoot you.
it's--it's remarkable.
it--it turns out Daniel's theory can be applied to stock-market behavior.
i-it basically decodes how--how you could manipulate the system.
it's astonish...
stay calm.
there's a storm door by the stairs.
we can get out that way.
storm door... how do you...
how do you know about the storm door?
because I saw it on the way in.
Rebecca, we've got to get out of here now.
you don't understand the kind of man who is trying to kill you.
and you do, Mr. Chance?
how do you know so much about this house...
the storm door and...and the attic?
about all of it...
me and Daniel and--and how all these pieces fit together?
it's my job.
the storm door...
is how the police said whoever killed Daniel got in here.
Rebecca, listen to me...
do you know who's trying to kill me?
do you know who killed my husband?
answer me!
I killed your husband.
you what?
Rebecca, I have no idea how you must be feeling, but right now I am the only person who can protect you.
you--you killed Daniel!
there is an assassin in this house.
I can protect you.
I should kill you right now for what you did!
Rebecca, listen!
come on, Chance, answer your phone.
answer your ph...
careful! It won't help anyone if we don't make it there alive.
fine. Drive how you like.
I knew this case would come back and bite him in the ass.
I knew it would. That's why I told him not to take it.
but he didn't listen.
he never listens, kind of like you, except at least he can fight.
I just hope we ain't too late.
are you really that worried about him?
your damn right I'm worried about him!
he ain't thinking straight.
hasn't been thinking straight this whole case.
what do you mean? -I mean...
Yes, he's done a lot of terrible things in his past.
I'm not gonna argue that point.
and that makes him vulnerable to all the bad guys out there who think they can exploit that.
I suppose redemption comes at a price.
you killed Daniel.
you deserve to die.
you're right.
I do.
go ahead.
just pull the trigger.
no one will blame you, least of all me.
don't be so hard on yourself. Rebecca, don't...
I got to hand it to you, Chance.
a part of me was wondering whether or not you'd even be able to pull it off...
protecting her from that monster, still finding the husband's theory.
who the hell are you?
I'm the man who hired him to kill your husband.
it wasn't anything personal, mind you.
it's just business.
like me killing you both now...
it's just business.
when I saw how much someone was offering for the hit,
I figured that theory would provide me with a nice retirement.
that's what all this is about...
about money?
almost always is...
except for our friend Chance here.
this guy's got a conscience.
I always tried to tell him that was bad for business, but he never listened.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I know it doesn't matter now, but...I'm sorry.
I told you, I hate bad guys.
hey dude.
what's this?
it's what we pulled off the dead lawyer's computer.
it's the full story on Daniel Brooks.
the, uh-- the guy had been blackmailing the bank for years, had a secret account with millions in the Caymans.
he was planning on making a run for it, wasn't really the settle-down type.
did someone tell you to speak?
okay, you know what?
enough of the whole Don Corleone thing.
I'm the one who got the lawyer's info off Donnelly, remember?
all I'm saying is I demand some respect.
demand?
okay, may... maybe not demand...
Suggest...Strongly.
nice work, Ames. - Thanks.
my pleasure.
let's go.
where?
okay.
she has no idea. - Who?
Rebecca--about who her husband really was.
that doesn't forgive me for what I did...
not to him, not to anyone else.
well, the assassin that Chance took out yesterday is now in police custody, but he was just a hired gun.
the lawyer at the investment bank was his only contact.
unfortunately, Donnelly killed him before we had a chance to get enough information.
tracing things back to anyone else at the firm at this point is highly unlikely.
the formula your husband created...
it's very, very valuable information if it's in the right hands.
it will be.
I gave it to a reporter I know at the National Business Journal.
Daniel would have been thrilled to see his work published.
well, you did the right thing.
I'm glad we could help you.
I have to ask you, mrs. Pucci, how do you do it?
do what?
work with him...
be in the same room as him.
I think I understand how hard these last few days have been for you.
I know the pain of losing someone you love.
I guess all I can say is...
I hope you find the strength to move past all the hurt and the anger that comes with it.
and I hope I do too.
Mr. Chance...
my husband was a good man, an innocent man.
do you think that saving me makes up for what you did?
is that it?
well, it doesn't.
why didn't you tell her the truth about her husband?
she doesn't need to hear it.
well, maybe she does.
that's not what I'm here for.
I'm here to protect her. That's what she needed.
that's what I do.
do you want to tell me why we're here?
Nope.
sorry, Guerrero, bring-your-daughter-to-drink day isn't until next month.
nice one, bro... real zinger.
reminds me of the joke I know about your brother.
Carl, right?
drives a green hatchback.
the punch line is he drives off a bridge.
you want to hear it? - What do you want?
club soda.
and, uh... And what?
and I can't believe I'm doing this.
open up a tab for her.
stop smiling.
expense reports.
how is he okay with it?
with what?
all of it.
he's not. None of us are.
that's why we try to make things right when we can...
if we can.
somebody gonna answer that?
Hello?
Yeah, I got your agency's number from a friend.
I think someone's trying to kill me.
Hello? Hello?
Yes, I think we can help.
the TRIPLE FRONTIER SOUTH AMERICA
you have come a long way for nothing.
I'm here to purchase the release of Susan Connors from the man I assume is your employer Miguel Cervantes.
I'm prepared to offer... - No.
I think Mr. Cervantes might feel differently when he hears how much I'm willing to pay.
there is no Cervantes. There is no Susan Connors.
no, wait, wait.
your boss kidnapped a journalist from her hotel room in Asuncion four days ago.
now, that journalist happens to be a friend of mine.
and I'm prepared to pay an obscene amount of money.
so don't be stupid.
you are being sent home as a courtesy.
most who make it this far aren't so lucky.
don't come back.
I'm sorry. You went where?
because I thought you said that you tried to see Miguel Cervantes, the most dangerous warlord on The Triple Frontier, which is saying something, and that you did it alone.
Yes.
help me out here 'cause when we discussed this the other day,
I explained to you that no one knows where to find Cervantes.
Yes. - And that they kill people down there for even asking.
you're worried about me.
I'm worried about who's gonna pay the bills around here if you end up dead in some South American gutter somewhere.
it's been almost five days since Susan went missing investigating a story about Cervantes.
and we all agree that if Cervantes simply wanted her dead, he would've done it publicly.
so she's probably still alive. - Probably.
the State Department can't act because they have no way of getting a message to him.
the local governments won't act because they're afraid of him.
and when I asked you about rescue options, you said there weren't any.
well, I meant that I couldn't think of any.
well, what's the difference?
in the interim, I may have thought of one.
well, what is it?
I've known this woman since we were children.
well, it's a little unorthodox. You might not like it. But could be worth a try.
no. No.
hell, no. - Oh, you got my note.
Yeah, I got your note. Bad idea.
terrible idea. I won't be a part of it.
won't be a part of what?
all right, let's just start at the beginning.
a few years ago, Miguel Cervantes hired an assassin to take out the President of Paraguay.
the assassin was successful. Was quite proud of himself, I might add.
we're talking about you.
no. Wasn't me. It was a guy I know.
anyway, Cervantes and this assassin had a falling out.
define falling out. - Cervantes tried to kill him.
which means that the assassin might be inclined to help us stage a rescue.
dude. No. I mean, seriously.
this guy's a bad egg. You can't trust him.
Really? You see what's happening here?
we agree. Now imagine how that makes me feel.
you think I'm happy about this?
I didn't want to see him again let alone ask him for help.
but the lady wants to get her friend back so I don't have any better ideas. Do you?
will someone please tell me what's going on here?
who is this guy and why is it such a big deal to ask for his help?
he was picked up by the FBI then he was traded to the Russians.
apparently they wanted him more than our guys did.
he's not gonna be easy to get to, but I just don't see any other way.
Drankov. FSB.
which way to the Special Prisoner's section?
over there. - Thanks.
so the only person who can help rescue Susan is a professional killer you neither like nor trust who's currently rotting in a Siberian prison, and these two think you're completely crazy for even suggesting it.
is that a vaguely accurate picture of what we're talking about here?
pretty much.
Oh, last time I saw him, we tried to kill each other.
look, I know it sounds bad. But if we're gonna stage a rescue for Susan, - I think... - Do it.
whatever it takes.
we have to get Susan out of there alive.
just out of curiosity, can you tell me the name of this assassin?
well, he goes by several names.
but the one I know him by is...
Hello, matey.
siberia Kolyma prison
I wish I knew you were coming.
might've cleaned up the place for you.
this isn't a social call.
Miguel Cervantes kidnapped a journalist named Susan Connors.
there's reason to believe she's alive, being held in his compound.
and this pertains to me how?
I need your help.
is that a fact?
I know that Cervantes' compound is well guarded.
I know that getting in and out cleanly is gonna take some finesse.
what I don't know... - is where to find him.
tell me where to find the compound--that's all I need.
and what do I get out of this exactly?
you get to get off your ass, come up here, and point your finger on a map or I get the guards to open this door and I come in there.
man, I missed you.
so what's the story with those two anyway?
well, before Chance was...Chance, he and Baptiste worked for the same boss.
a master assassin who took them both in and trained them.
they called him "the old man.
and in a weird way, they were the closest thing Chance had to family.
so why does Chance hate him so much?
he wanted out of that life.
well, that didn't go over too well.
and a woman close to Chance ended up getting killed over it.
Baptiste killed her?
I promise you, do not mess with me on this one.
and I promise you that's not my intention.
I just simply do not know where the compound is.
you were there yourself. - Blindfolded on the way in.
and coming out, transportation was provided for me.
provided by who? - A gentleman by the name of Esteban.
he's a local enemy of Cervantes.
the Triple Frontier is not a particularly welcoming place.
Esteban helped because he knew me.
but for you, not so much.
what are you saying? - What am I saying?
I'm saying I can't help you find Cervantes unless you take me with you.
fat chance. Have a nice life.
you will never find her without me.
Cervantes is a ghost down there.
and if you had another option, you wouldn't be here in the first place.
what's this all about anyway?
you want to get close to Cervantes? You want to kill him? Settle a score? What?
grudges are for the weak of spirit. And you know that's not me.
then why?
geezer has my watch. - I beg your pardon?
the target Cervantes hired me to liquidate, he wore a vintage Breguet, Heritage Collection.
it's a work of art, really. And when I escaped, it got left behind.
give me the chance to retrieve it and I'll help you save the girl.
I give you my word, junior.
what the hell are you doing to my conference room?
does she really need to know or is this one of those things it's better off if she doesn't?
sidebar.
its hardware that allows us to piggyback on a military spy satellite so we can keep an eye on Chance and Baptiste.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that that's illegal.
extremely.
look, I didn't want Chance talking to Baptiste in the first place, remember?
at least this way, wherever they go, I can watch his back.
I need temporary custody of prisoner Baptiste.
custody? What makes you think I would agree to that?
this, my friend, is a Private Bank of Geneva Black Card.
airport club access, concierge services, no spending limit.
compliments of Ilsa Pucci.
I'll have Baptiste back in 48 hours. Until then, knock yourself out.
there is only one problem.
prisoners must be within sight of a guard at all times.
Uh-uh. Not now.
I need you on your toes.
plus I don't have to tell you what's gonna be waiting for us when we get off this plane.
let's go over some ground rules.
ground rules? We're at grammar school now, are we?
rule number one, cuffs stay on at all times. -You're kidding me.
rule number two, you will not touch a weapon of any kind.
I'm ashamed to know you. I truly am.
rule number three. When this is finished, you're going straight back to that prison.
are we clear? - All except rule number three.
that's non-negotiable.
we'll see.
who is that?
his name's Captain Mike Harmen. He's the contact of the Defense Department.
I've been on the phone with him all week trying to get some help with Susan.
I'll be right with you, Captain Harmen.
I'll go with you. - Why?
Highly-illegal satellite setup.
chance on ground with fugitive assassin.
we need to make sure this goes very carefully.
I once sat a poker table with Rumsfeld, Kissinger, and the Chief of Operations for the Mossad.
so? - Rummy still owes me 1, 000 bucks.
so what can I do for you, Captain?
Mrs. Pucci, we have a problem.
look, I get it.
you told me not to go after Susan Connors and I went anyway.
your boss put some heat on you. He told you to come down here and put some heat on me.
can't we just save ourselves some time and go get some lunch?
we certainly could...
had I not received this message just before I arrived here.
what is that?
that is a photograph sent by my liaison in the Paraguayan Army of your private plane sitting in an airfield just a few miles away from The Triple Frontier.
that's the ground. Why are you disconnecting the ground wire?
I think we've got a problem. - What kind of problem?
captain Mike Harmen has asked the Paraguayan Army to seize my plane.
I think Chance just lost his getaway.
where are your two friends?
there's a doorway down there on the right.
that's Esteban's place.
but before we go in, can I renew my objection to the current state of my hands?
I already told you. - Yeah, I know. I know. Rule one.
thing is, folks around here don't take kindly to strangers asking questions.
what sense does it make to handicap ourselves from the outset?
you know what, you got a point.
better? - Not even close.
greetings, matey. - Drink, amigo?
whiskey.
so we're looking for Esteban. Have you seen him?
uh, yeah, we seem to have lost the keys.
it's a funny story, actually. - You want to see Esteban,
Esteban does not want to see you.
put down the gun.
you first.
I asked you to put the gun down.
I won't ask again.
no. - Oh, you are such a child.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
you asked me to help you find Esteban, and I'm doing that, but you're getting lost in the details, matey.
details my ass. Give me the gun.
this gun? You want this gun?
come and take it from me.
you don't think I can just smack you up and take that gun?
no, I really don't.
all right, folks, you're in for a little show.
what about a different plane?
is there no other way to fly them out of there?
not from down there. Not with this kind of notice.
we need to figure out a way to get Harmen to release that plane.
I've been dealing with him all week. He's not a "bend the rules" kind of guy.
what are you doing? I did that an hour ago. It doesn't work.
system INITIALIZING
you loosened the lid for me.
if Chance still has his phone, the satellite should be locked in on him.
right there.
what the hell are they doing?
well, it appears they're kicking the crap out of each other.
I assume this doesn't bode well for Susan's rescue.
zoom out, would you?
what's that?
that is a problem.
come on. Answer your phone.
answer your phone.
Hola, Esteban.
we were, um, hoping you could help us find Cervantes.
so, Esteban, is it fair to assume that you're now working for Cervantes?
where are they? - I don't know.
I got no signal to lock onto, man. He must've lost his phone.
how do we find him?
we don't.
no signal to latch on to. Could take hours to find him.
every minute we spend looking is a minute we take away from figuring out a way to get that plane off the ground.
so what, we just leave them there and hope for the best?
I don't like this any more than you do.
but right now, getting that plane free is the only way we can help get them home alive.
Yeah, that's assuming they're not dead already.
Hey! What? I'm just saying.
you said that Esteban helped you escape from Cervantes.
that they were mortal enemies or something.
Hey, may I remind you, if you hadn't lost your mind about me having a weapon, we probably wouldn't be in this mess.
you knew the rules. - The rules. Here we go.
I don't trust you at all so we stick to the rules.
you have no idea how silly that sounds coming from you.
what I should trust you? - Why shouldn't you?
when you left me and the old man, you said nothing.
that decision must've been brewing for-- for quite a while, right?
so how many days?
how many conversations did me and you have during which the only thought in your head was about running away?
and you never said a word.
you call that being honest?
dig your graves.
dude, no way.
Why? It's a simple Norma Jean.
first of all, there's no such thing as a simple Norma Jean, all right?
when a Norma Jean goes badly, it goes real bad.
a Norma Jean went badly on my cousin Pat. She ended up pregnant with twins.
well, you got a better idea? - Yeah.
let's call that Ames broad.
she went back East. Clear head after that heist debacle.
fine. Then I'll go.
and do what? Put a gun to Harmen's head?
what's wrong with putting a gun to his head?
a lot of productive things have happened by putting a gun to someone's head.
wait a second.
your friend, Captain Harmen, said he had a liaison down there with the Paraguayan Army.
that's probably who he called to seize the plane, right?
so why don't we call the guy ourselves, get him to release the plane?
we get into Harmen's office, find out who that liaison is and how to contact him.
then we figure out a way to make it look like Harmen's making the call to him.
we get into his office. But what if he's in his office?
Oh, that's easy. We'll just send you.
what? - Dude?
it's not a bad idea. - It certainly sounds like one.
I agree.
this ain't that hard.
the info we want is probably on Harmen's computer.
now you just go down there and you--you make nice and say you're sorry about what happened before.
then you take a pirate modem. Put it close enough to his computer so I can hack into it.
the whole thing takes a couple of minutes.
he's right. It's a terrible idea.
I played poker with Rummy." What happened to that?
that was a game. What you're asking me to do...
I'm not a field operative.
listen, you want to see your friend Susan alive again, then you're gonna become one.
sorry. About before.
I probably should've taken those cuffs off you at the bar.
what, that's it?
what? You want me to be sorry about something else?
if you don't know, I'm not gonna explain it to you.
why don't I hear something like "hey, junior, thanks for the last 24 hours. It was nice to get some fresh air."
you had a drink. You had a few laughs at my expense.
you got to admit, this day beats the crap out of any day you had in that prison cell.
I shouldn't have been in that jail cell for you to find me in the first place.
whose fault is that anyway? Don't get mad at me.
get mad at the old man.
when I got thrown in Chi Hoa, he busted me out in three weeks.
Yeah, well, that situation was different. - Why was it different?
cause that was you.
he cut you lose, didn't he?
Why?
is it because you got caught?
or maybe it was because you were doing the catching.
but your guess is as good as mine, mate.
but I haven't heard a word from him since the last time we saw each other.
hurry up.
se? Or Baptiste.
I'm surprised to see you again.
what are you doing here?
well, it appears I'm digging my own grave.
what are you doing here?
truth be told,
I'm in the market for a new job and I'm hoping that you're hiring.
you son of a...
you want to work for me?
Yes, I do.
very interesting. Let's discuss it then, shall we?
and what about this one? -I don't know.
he may some value to you.
thanks for bringing me down here, junior.
sorry it had to be this way.
and, uh, sorry about this.
Oh, you're awake.
I'm Susan.
Yeah, I heard a little bit about you.
I'm Christopher Chance. Ilsa Pucci sent me here to rescue you.
Ilsa sent you? - Yeah.
to rescue me? - Mm-hmm.
and, uh, how's this rescue going?
could be worse.
So...What brings a nice journalist like you to a place like this?
well, I came down here chasing a story trying to tie Cervantes to the murder of this country's President.
just before I got caught, I found the link.
witnesses who can blow the story wide open.
Cervantes wants to know who talked.
so far, my interrogators have been keeping things fairly polite.
but something tells me with you here, that's about to change.
Yeah, it's a pretty safe bet. Listen, can you reach my pants with your foot?
in the lining of my pocket flap, there's a syringe filled with anesthetic.
maybe we could use it on your friend when he comes back.
do I need to ask why you have a full syringe of anesthetic in your pocket?
well, I brought someone with me to help find you.
someone who I was worried might try to screw me over.
and where exactly is this someone now? -Screwing me over.
join me. Please.
or Baptiste.
your track record is quite impressive.
prime Minister Goetz. Justice Rabang in Manila.
you're an artist.
but our history together, it makes your proposal, while tempting, also somewhat difficult to believe.
our past is what it is.
you were unhappy with my work. That's your prerogative.
I'd hired you to do a job -you hired me to eliminate a man, which I did.
and you wanted him humiliated, tortured.
it's simply not me. It's inelegant.
is that my watch?
no. That is Esteban's watch. A gift from me.
well, then let's forget about our past and discuss our future, shall we?
be careful. -I've almost got it.
I can't believe that worked.
me neither.
all right, he's probably got a knife on him-- let's find it and cut ourselves down.
put that in your ear.
Oh, God. I can't believe I'm doing this.
it's gonna be easy.
just take this pirate modem. See? So you turn it on right there.
get that within range of Harmen's computer.
and I'll take it from there.
all right, I'm in position.
she moving yet? -Getting there.
take your time, dude.
view's real nice from up here.
so what's he doing again?
he's gonna splice into their switchboard so that when we call Paraguay to get your plane released, it'll sound like the call's coming from Harmen's office.
now, listen, once we're logged in, Harmen gets locked out of his computer.
so he can't be on there while I'm doing my search.
so how do I keep him from looking at his computer?
opening a button might help.
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
you sure?
Mrs. Pucci.
Hello, Captain.
how are you? -I'm fine.
what are you doing down here?
I don't feel very good about yesterday, and I was hoping we could maybe talk about it a little bit.
come on in.
Margaret, this is Ilsa Pucci.
hello. -Hello. Margaret.
please tell me Margaret is not sitting in front of the computer.
look, I can't hack in till you get her away from there.
Oh, it's a simple Norma Jean.
nothing to worry about.
Oh, shut up!
what I am offering you are the services of a professional without peer.
I think there's a path over there that leads to the front gate.
we're not taking the front gate. Baptiste said it's too heavily guarded.
do you know of any other way out?
he mentioned a back way, but I don't know where to find it.
well, you got any better ideas?
so please think carefully before you throw out a number less you insult me and lose out on this opportunity altogether.
20 million.
dollars?
u. S. for a year of your time.
there's one condition.
it's my understanding that the man you arrived here with was once quite close to you.
you understand I need to be certain that you and he are not playing me for a fool.
kill him and then we'll have a deal.
sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
good.
Hello, fellas.
if you've come to argue about your ground rules again,
I think you're going to be sorely disappointed.
we can discuss that later. That's not why I'm here.
no? Then why are you here?
to ask for your help.
I'm sorry?
you're asking for my help? Still?
I'm getting real tired of it too.
but you know the way out of here, I don't.
you gave me your word. I came here to see what its worth.
I am deeply sorry I have to do this.
but I will be taking that watch back now.
get in!
chance, where the hell are you? What's going on?
we've got Susan. We're heading to the plane. Is there anything else I should know?
Yeah. Stand by.
Ilsa, you need to hurry.
I'm a little confused. You're here to apologize about yesterday?
Yes.
so you admit the plane down there is part of a rescue mission?
I've been advised not to answer that question.
all right, I'm patched into the switchboard.
she got the modem on yet?
not yet.
Ilsa. Listen, you got to get that damn computer clear.
I'm sorry. Could you ask your secretary if she could give us a minute to speak in private?
I am a Senior Policy Analyst.
thank you, Margaret.
chance, we're trying to free up the plane. We need a couple of minutes.
I don't have a couple of minutes.
please have a seat.
we're in.
all right, Mrs. Pucci, what is it you want to talk about?
modem's been activated. We're uploading.
well...I feel as if we don't really know each other very well.
Hey, save a bullet. -Why?
machinegun nests either side of the rear gate.
once we get around the turn, about 30 meters.
not gonna give us much time.
about two or three seconds and then we're full of holes.
okay, turns coming. You ready? -Ready.
next left! Take it!
come on, dude, and give me a number.
hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
so I assume you went to college.
Yeah. Yes, I did.
did you like it?
Mrs. Pucci, you come all the way down here.
you offer me one of the more bizarre apologies I've ever heard.
you dismiss a woman from my office who is probably going to be my boss one day to ask me questions about where I went to school and whether or not I'm allowed to wear jeans on Fridays?
what are you doing here? And I want a straight answer.
well...
that's a completely fair question.
come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
one moment. -Are you seeing anyone?
did you just ask me out? -Yeah.
Yes, I did.
I just felt there might be some chemistry here between us.
you?
got it. Good job, Ilsa. We're done. Get out of there.
okay then. I better go.
captain Carlos Montoya. 2nd division.
sending you the number. -Got it.
this is Captain Harmen. I need to speak to Captain Montoya right away.
Montoya. -Montoya, this is Harmen.
release the plane immediately. -Yes, sir.
there's a military barricade.
what should I do? They're not moving.
just don't stop.
you know, with most people, when I haven't seen them for a few months, the big surprise is they've changed their hair.
what the hell are you doing here?
truthfully, I have no idea.
I guess I'm-- I'm doing what Marshall would've wanted me to.
Yeah.
so where did you find the guy? Chance?
Oh, God. -Really? I don't know.
seemed nice enough to me.
excuse me a sec, Susan.
So...What are you doing here?
Oh, I think we both know what I'm doing here.
your plane was released from local control roughly 18 hours ago.
communications mix-up according to my contact down there.
and now I see Susan Connors sitting in your office safe and sound.
you gamed me.
I don't know how, but you did.
you know, there is one more thing I'd like to know.
what?
when you asked me if I was seeing someone, was that part of the game or did you really want to know?
I think...
well, uh, I would ask you to remember that...
given the context -so I'll pick you up at 8: 00.
don't do it.
it's not even the most expensive one on the tray.
no. But it's your favorite so you can't have any.
yet again. Focused on the little details and missing out on the bigger picture.
which is? -That you trusted me.
and you were rewarded for that trust.
let's go overboard here, okay? I know you better than you think.
and there was a moment back there where you were thinking about shooting me.
I was not. -Yes, you were.
well, the man made a convincing argument. And I do have material needs.
I'm only human.
and besides, it suddenly occurred to me that...
and despite what this says about me and despite how truly distressing the thought...
you might be the last friend I've got on this earth.
I've spent most of the last six years wishing you were dead.
we're not friends. Not by any definition I know of.
well, yeah, beggars can't be choosers, right?
it makes this so much more unpleasant. Hold this.
Really?
in my defense, I was extremely frank about my intentions on this trip.
I simply can't have you put me back in that cell.
I think we both know you're not gonna shoot me.
Oh, come on. What did he ever do to you?
let's discuss what's gonna happen next.
I'm gonna enjoy a glass of my favorite cognac.
you tell the pilot we're diverting to Caracas.
once we land, I'll walk out.
I think you know that I can't let that happen.
be that as it may...Salud.
I have a counter proposal.
do you now?
come work for me.
I beg your pardon? -You heard me.
I think you enjoyed helping.
I think there's more to the old man cutting you off story than you're letting on.
I think you're about where I was three years ago.
and no more ready to talk about it either.
you're joking.
maybe. You saying you don't trust me?
not one...
ketamine in the cognac.
Yeah, I figured you couldn't resist.
sorry, but I was Frank about my intentions.
I got to take you back to where I got you.
that's very clever.
man, I really missed you.
do I even want to know?
probably not. So what happened with Baptiste?
I offered him a job. -Dude, seriously?
I don't have to put up with enough around here?
he turned it down.
at least there's still a little integrity left among criminals. So where is he?
well, let's see. Right about now it should be chow time in Siberia.
bet he didn't want to part with that.
So...How'd you get the Paraguayan Army to let us on the plane?
Norma Jean. -It's impossible.
can't bluff a Norma Jean with just two guys.
they had some help.
are you serious? I'm gone two days and she's out on the field?
not my call, dude. I'll clean that later.
Mr. Chance, I told you I was prepared to rescue Susan by any means necessary.
but I thought we had this conversation.
there's about a million things that could've gone wrong. You could've been arrested.
you were risking your life to save my friend. The least I could do was risk my reputation.
suppose a "thank you" is in order.
no. It's I who should thank you for bringing Susan safely home.
it looks like it wasn't easy.
Oh, comes with the turf.
sometimes a mission stays with you after it's done.
so I'm learning. Good night.
where you going?
I guess we both made a bit of a sacrifice on this one.
I have a date...With Captain Harmen.
who's Capt?
what kind of luck is this?
how the hell are you, Mr. Chance?
Harry, trust me, you don't want to be near me right now.
what kind of hello is that for a friend?
Hey, Guy. Whiskey, neat, please.
no, no, no. Better yet. Better yet.
whiskey on the rocks.
no, no, no. Whiskey and ginger.
no, I will have a ginger ale.
Harry, listen to me.
you need to leave this bar now.
leave? Fat chance, buddy.
I have met a very willing lady online, and she's about to meet me for a drink.
I'm sorry to cramp your style, but I'm not going anywhere...Friend.
you don't look so hot. You okay?
no. I had a bad day.
that's a bummer.
anything I can do to help?
Harry, look at the TV and talk about the race.
talk about the race now, or we both die.
come on...Autos. Go faster!
burn some rubber!
who the hell was that?
Harry, I need you to shut up and listen to me.
it all started a few days ago with a new client that Winston brought in.
48 HOURS EARLIER
this is our team.
uh, we just want to get them into the loop on your situation.
why don't you tell them what you just told me?
my fiance has threatened to kill me.
I don't know where to go to for help.
and your fiance is...
am I supposed to know who this person is?
Claypool Security Solutions.
paramilitary troops for hire. Global V. I. P. protection.
he's also a notorious recluse.
ironically enough, he's pretty paranoid about his own security.
his compound in Marin is said to be the most heavily guarded private residence in North America.
it wouldn't kill you to read a paper once in a while.
So...Why don't you tell them why he's threatening you.
I looked at Henry's private files when he walked away from his computer.
there's an arm of his company that no one knows about a group that carries out assassinations.
a hit squad.
heads of state...Drug rivals, CEOs.
you name the hit, he names a price.
Henry caught me looking at his files, and he made it clear that if I told anyone about it, or if I ever tried to leave him, then I'd be...
dead?
excuse me. Can I steal Mr. Guerrero for a moment?
would you please take him?
excuse me.
you were supposed to keep me apprised of your progress...
regarding the matter between us.
Oh, that picture of your husband and that broad.
Yes.
I think it's probably best if we both just forget about this.
look, she had a series of fake names, aliases at hotels only paid through accounts that, weren't traceable, burner cell phones she only talked to Marshall on. Are you?
what are you insinuating?
she was his mistress.
you--you don't know that.
I, uh...Have been doing this a long time, okay?
I can read between the lines.
sorry, dude.
so all we got to do is tie Claypool to these hit squads, and we take him down.
easier said than done.
the computer where I saw the records it's in Henry's private office, and it's completely off-network.
you can't access it remotely.
so we break in.
that's where it gets interesting.
Claypool's compound is on an 800-acre ranch.
perimeter is completely surrounded by electric fencing and cameras every 20 feet-- it's airtight.
now, once you're inside the fence, there's a patrol 24-7 of a company-strength unit of Claypool's elite private security.
all those guys are ex-military--serious operators.
and even if we do get past the fence and the cameras and the army of guards,
Claypool's office inside the house-- that's a whole other headache.
temperature control sensors-- to within 1/10 of a degree.
body temperature will set the alarms off in seconds.
the floor is completely covered with invisible laser sheeting.
so anything touches that, and...
what happens? - Nothing.
what do you think happens?
alarms, guards, reign of terror-- try to keep up.
I was just asking a question.
you must think I'm a fool...
for not seeing through Henry's lies, for not realizing sooner the kind of man he truly is.
we're not here to judge you, Miss Han.
we're here to get you out of this.
and to do that, we're gonna need you to go back to Claypool so he doesn't get suspicious-- still, all things considered, it's gonna take a hell of a lot of maneuvering to get us inside that place to get us what we need.
I can get us in.
how long have you been standing there?
Oh, long enough.
are--are you a part of the team?- Yes.
not really.
I'm Ilsa Pucci, and this is my company.
could we have a word, boss?
don't you dare try and stop me.
you know, Claypool tried for years to do business with Marshall.
if I reach out to him for a sit-down, he's sure to agree.
okay, let's just slow down a little bit.
I think I know what this is about.
Yeah, it's about freeing our client from that horrible man.
this is about the mistress in the photo. Guerrero told me all about it.
he told you?
he was worried about you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Guerrero was worried about me?
we tell each other things.
but that's not the point. - Well, what is your point?
the point is, you're looking at a woman who was lied to by a man she thought she knew, and you're taking it personally.
how dare you?
look, what Marshall did or didn't do
I- I- I can do anything about that.
but that woman in the other room, I can help her
I can do something about that.
so...so let me...Please.
what? You let her come on the mission?
she pays the bills, Harry.
I don't let her do anything.
she came up with a reasonable plan, and I knew I could make it work.
all right.
I mean, how bad could it be?
you're sitting here, so I guess it turned out okay.
the job went south.
one of the team didn't make it out.
someone got left behind? You're kidding me. Who?
you picked a great night for a blind date, Harry.
I- I don't understand. W- what's happening here?
in about ten minutes, an exchange is going to take place.
if we return to Claypool what we stole from him, he's agreed to release the prisoner.
winston had to set this up in a public place to keep them honest, hence the bar.
wait, where's-- where's the prisoner?
you're looking at him.
what? You're the guy who didn't make it?
what are you doing sitting there? Why don't you do something?
it's an I. E. D. If I move, I die.
breathe, Harry.
all right, all right, all right. Stay calm. Stay calm.
you've got a bomb underneath your seat.
Yeah. It's pretty well-made too.
these guys must have spent some time in Iraq.
I get up, and it blows.
maybe I should just move over.
Harry, if you want to leave, it's fine-- I totally understand.
well, I mean, I do have a big day tomorrow.
what do you mean leave? I'm not gonna leave.
you've been there every single time.
I've had a gun or a missile or even a woman pointed in my direction.
I'm not gonna leave.
we're in this together. Now, what's the plan?
well, now we have about eight minutes left until the exchange.
and I'm pretty sure that if Claypool gets his way,
I'm gonna end up dead.
so I need to figure a way out of this.
but now that you're here, you're going to help.
you want me to take somebody out? I can do that for you. - Harry...
classically trained in the martial arts, baby. - Harry...
I'm sorry. I'm getting ahead of myself. Tell me what to do.
step one, order a martini with extra olives.
I can't. Gin makes me wheeze.
order the martini.
Hey, guy. Martini, extra olives.
why am I ordering a martini? I don't want a martini.
I thought I was supposed to talk, and you were supposed to listen.
a good operator craves intel.
it's probably best if you just tell me everything that's happened so far.
we don't have time for that.
just give me the quick version.
want me to shut up? I'm telling you how to do it.
all right.
Claypool's office-- the break-in.
figure we'll pair you and Chance up to take the office.
sounds good. It'll be nice, actually.
chance and I have some catching up to do.
what the hell does that mean?
don't worry about us. We can beat that room.
question is, uh, can the fifth Beatle over there get the password to access the computer before this whole plan goes to pot?
that's a $9, 000 bottle of wine you're poisoning...
just so you're all aware.
somehow I imagine you won't be missing that.
and it's not poison, all right?
it's sodium thiopental.
seriously, the wine is the best way to deliver it.
the guy's paranoid about his food, but he's got a weak spot for the good stuff.
this will render him compliant?
this will render him mush...
at least for a little while.
chatty, disoriented-- incapable of concealing the truth.
essentially, he'll be Ames.
look, all you got to do is ask him for the password.
when he coughs it up, we're home free.
we should probably get going. Mr. Claypool's expecting me.
Psst. Hey...
you know, when, um-- when you called her aside the other day, we were kind of under the impression that you were gonna, you know, talk her out of this.
talk her out of what?
getting us all killed.
don't you think this is a bit of a risky proposition, to give Ilsa this big a role in an operation like this?
all right, guys, she said she could get us an invite to the compound-- she did.
and she's helped us out in the past.
here and there, yeah.
but this is way different.
for one, it's a hell of a lot more dangerous.
things are gonna be happening really quickly.
and the whole damn thing is riding on her.
she needs to be able to read situations, man-- adapt without thinking.
there's a reason you never, ever put an amateur in the driver's seat.
all valid considerations, gentlemen, except for one.
she's not in the driver's seat. I am.
trust me, I've got it under control.
all right, we just went through the gate, about a half a kilometer to the house.
okay. Copy that.
so about four years ago, this guy I know tries to break into this place.
Claypool's Security catches him.
officially, he's reported missing.
unofficially, if you were to dig in just the right place in these woods out here, he wouldn't be so missing anymore.
and Claypool's political connections make sure that nobody does that digging.
are you inventing ghost stories to scare me, Mr. Guerrero? Really?
his name was Marvin.
I still send money to his wife and kids every now and then.
why are you telling me this now?
because I like you, and it's not too late to turn around.
and where would that leave Sarah?
no. We move forward.
chance, 100 meters to the house.
copy that.
so there's something I've been, uh, meaning to ask you about.
are you, uh, seeing anybody right now, like, romantically?
all right, we're 50 meters out.
we've been working together for a while now, right?
and in all that time, I haven't really seen you date anybody.
and frankly, that boggles my mind.
you're, like, a total catch.
anyway, I would like to help.
I have this friend, right?
and I think you two would get along great.
her name's Melanie, and she's really friendly.
20 meters out. Security's out in front of the house.
looks like we're getting inspected.
I'm not interested. I need you to focus, Ames.
I'm focused.
I'm just saying she's very friendly, if you know what I mean.
open your trunk and step out of your vehicle.
no problem.
Mrs. Pucci...I'm Mr. Vaughn, head of security.
Mr. Claypool's waiting for you. Right this way.
you may wait in the service area.
we'll park the car for you.
service area?
are you the driver?
you will sit there. You will not leave except to use the restroom.
Oh, and while you're here, make yourself useful.
they got me folding napkins, dude.
weekend warrior's running point, and I'm on napkin duty.
just great.
Yeah, yeah. Quit moaning.
you're in range of the network. Just flip the switch.
this is so wrong.
okay, Chance, I got video. You loose yet?
not yet. Stand by.
when I say this girl has no expectations, I mean it.
all she's after is a few drinks, maybe dinner, definitely sex.
Ames, enough.
we're clear.
all right, I need you to head southwest.
I'll monitor the down-cycle video, get you into Claypool's office without being seen.
then we just got to hope Ilsa can get Claypool to drink the wine before we're all dead.
Mrs. Pucci.
so pleased you could make it all this way.
Mr. Claypool. The pleasure's all mine.
a gift.
Hmm...Very nice. Thank you.
my fiancee, Sarah. She'll join us in a moment.
that's a beautiful animal. - You ride?
once upon a time.
that's interesting,'cause I myself don't see the appeal.
loss of control, perhaps.
all clear.
there's no more patrols coming at you for the next few minutes.
just head north, down that corridor.
you should see the office door.
all right, Winston, we're here.
we're entering Sarah's code.
listen, now, once you open that door, your body's is gonna raise the temperature in that room fast, which means you'll only have ten seconds to get it back down.
and that, my friends, is how it's done.
are you sure the lasers are there?
pretty sure.
all right, Chance, you're up.
got to get to that computer.
what's the problem?
the table isn't where it was in Winston's plan.
somebody must have moved it.
can you make it?
I read you. But I need you to hang on a second.
they're about to serve the wine.
if Ilsa can't get the password, it won't matter if you can get to the computer or not.
so tell me, Mrs. Pucci.
why did you come all this way to see us?
I'd like to talk to you about a business proposal.
a partnership.
what sort of partnership?
well, our aid camps all over the world are constantly the target of local harassment, intimidation.
my husband always believed in using his checkbook to resolve those disputes.
but lately I've begun to call into question those methods.
and, well, we need a friend...A strong friend.
aren't you joining me?
Oh, my physician advised me against it.
he just set the glass down, didn't he?
give her a chance to save it.
save it? Are you kidding, man? She just blew it.
Ilsa, I need you to be calm, okay?
don't let this guy see you rattled.
this is great, man. I'm going in there.
okay, hang on.
are you out of your mind? You're on camera!
if they look up and see that you're gone, this whole thing is shot.
this whole thing's shot anyway if she can't get him to drink the wine, dude.
she will figure it out.
she'll figure something out? What's she gonna figure out?
you know, on second thought...
my doctor need never know.
a toast.
future endeavors.
she didn't just do what I think she did, did she?
Yeah. She dosed herself.
amateurs, dude-- told you.
all right, I got a toothpick in my sock.
if this is some kind of practical joke, I'm gonna be pissed.
trust me, Harry, it'll all make sense soon.
now I need you to buy this bottle of scotch, third from the left.
what do you think I make? That's 100 bucks a bottle.
just buy it. I'll reimburse you.
Hey, Guy...
can I have a bottle of the McLaughlin?
what? I'm thirsty.
when I was in the bathroom, it occurred to me how many times
I've asked to go on a mission with you.
and every single time I ask you, this is what you say "maybe next week, Harry."
Or,"there's not enough room in the car, Harry."
Or,"Guerrero's gonna slit your throat, Harry."
Yeah. So?
so I never took it personally. I never did.
I know your team dynamics are kind of delicate.
you guys are kind of a clique.
but then I wondered, why did you-- why did you let Ilsa come on the mission?
I told you, she had the idea to get us in the door.
but you knew she wasn't thinking straight because of the photo of her husband.
Harry, what are you getting at?
just finish your story. We only got a couple minutes.
so Ilsa had just drugged herself, which obviously wasn't part of the plan.
Henry, is everything okay?
I don't feel well.
I think it's the wine. - Yeah.
there's something in it. - Yes.
what did you do? - Mrs. Pucci...
it's all right, Sarah. It's all right.
we gave you a dose of sodium thiopental so that Sarah and I can learn the password to all your secret files and then use that information to put you behind bars.
come on, guys, this is a disaster, man.
she's saying whatever pops into her head.
okay, hold on, hold on.
she might be able to salvage this.
she'll only salvage it if she asks for the damn password!
but you can't do this.
why not? What's to stop me?
my security chief.
the moment he hears what's happening here...
I didn't think about that.
Ilsa, I need you - What are you gonna do?
Sarah, relax.
you're gonna ask him for the password!
darling - we'll tie him up.
tie him up? What are you tying him up for?
chance, listen to me now.
stay focused. Just get to the computer.
Guerrero, we're running out of time. Get in there. Help Ilsa.
Finally!
Winston, am I clear?
come on, you got this. You're the man.
all right, Ames, I know you mean well, but you're distracting me.
Oh, my God.
I got it. It's cool.
listen, on second thought, is there any way we can get that password a little faster?
all right, Guerrero, you are clear, but hurry it up.
where do you think you're going?
I was looking for you. There's a roach.
no. - Yeah. Look.
how's that password coming?
clown time's over. Step aside.
look at me. Look at me!
what's your name? - Henry Claypool.
what day is today? - Tuesday.
are you a paranoid, bullying douche bag?
Oh, yeah. - Good.
what's the password to your private files in your office?
Mr. Guerrero. - Yeah?
thank you.
don't mention it.
you know, I've always admired your taste in clothes.
okay.
all right, dude, here's the password.
it's coming to you now. - Yeah?
Charlie, 2, 5, 1...Yaletown, Hotel, Foxtrot-- Got that?
okay...
I'm in.
three minutes. Great.
Thanks.
all right, let's motor.
remember, if we hit any trouble, follow my lead.
Mr. Claypool.
this way. Let's go. - No, wait.
the second he finds Henry, this whole place will shut down we'll never make it out.
Mr. Claypool.
sir, can I enter?
Mr. Vaughn, what is it?
well, I was knocking, and there was no answer.
is everything all right? - Honestly...No.
for starters, you've interrupted a very sensitive meeting between myself and your boss, and, secondly, I don't like your face.
my face? - It upsets me.
Winston, you there?
Yeah, I'm here! What the hell's going on?
things got a little hot in there, man--I got some bad news.
boss lady, she gave herself up.
what?
dude, no choice.
what do you mean there's no choice?
there is always a choice!
Yeah, well, as it turns out, that's not necessarily the case.
look, either someone stayed back to hold off Vaughn, or we all got busted.
and it wasn't like she was in any shape to get Sarah to the car.
why didn't you - Dude, I don't like it either.
look, I'll give her this-- for an amateur, she's got stones.
chance, what do we do?
on a smaller head, your eyes would be fine.
but combined with your ears and your oddly feminine bone structure, the effect is really quite unsettling.
Mrs. Pucci! I think that's enough.
well, in that case, Mr. Vaughn, why don't you leave us to our business and go and find someone else in this house to...
stop!
you're not going anywhere.
all right...I'm sending Ames out with the files.
just Ames?
go!
well, what are you gonna do?
I'm going to get Ilsa.
Chance...Listen to me now, okay?
Ilsa's caught. That's a fact.
there's nothing you can do about that, okay?
but the rest of you can still get out.
so you're saying leave her behind.
I'm saying that as long as we have Claypool's files, we can hold on to 'em and trade 'em for Ilsa later.
if you go back, you're gonna all get caught.
Winston, I got it. It's under control.
we have a breach, we have a breach.
whoever set off the alarms is still on the premises, and I want 'em caught.
copy that, sir. Perimeter lockdown under way.
you and your little friends...Are in a great deal of trouble.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Make room, people!
vehicle is fleeing the property. We're in pursuit.
it's gonna be tight.
they're approaching the gate now. I've got a lock on them.
Winston, the women and children are getting a little nervous.
hope you did your job, dude.
say when.
50 meters to the gate. They're not slowing down.
uh, now would be good.
Freeze! Hey, freeze!
all evidence to the contrary, at least one of us on this job was a professional.
sir, the perpetrator's vehicle just escaped from the southwest gate.
one male subject, two females.
Sarah's with them. She's part of it.
I want plates on that vehicle. I want to know how they escaped.
I want to know if anyone else is still on the premises, and I want to know now!
sir, there's another intruder in the compound.
get over there!
subject is hostile. I repeat, subject is extremely hostile!
returning fire!
we need some backup out here!
he's gone up the stairs!
get down, now!
come on, let's go.
sorry. Were you talking to me?
first things first, you drank the wine, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
winston I did a weakness in the perimeter.
we can't get there on foot. We're gonna need a ride.
I will say this there's a possibility that I was, in fact, over my head tonight.
you were right, as you often are when you're doing that prosaic, but admittedly sexy protective-male thing.
Thanks.
I don't know why I'm doing this to myself.
maybe it is because of Marshall's mistress.
well, I'm sorry that I put everyone in this position.
I'm sorry I didn't - You smell that?
what? - It smells like crap.
nice. Very nice.
you know, I'm trying to make a heartfelt apology here.
no, I mean, it smells like actual crap.
I think we found our ride.
listen, when I hop off, you're gonna want to stay on this course, find a hole in the fence.
wait, wait! You're hopping off?
look, there's too many guards. We can't outrun 'em.
I'm gonna have to buy you some time.
how will you get out of here?
I probably won't.
please don't do this.
Sarah's with the team. She has the information you need.
you can bargain me out later. You'll be fine.
no, I won't! This is all my fault!
hang on.
Listen...Don't beat yourself up.
when I let you come on this job, I knew something might happen.
then why would you let me come along with you?
I'll be fine. I promise.
you might want to hold on.
shots fired!
we've got shots fired in the north corner!
air two, air two, move in!
and here we are. Here's what's next.
in about one minute, one of our team is gonna walk through the door with the information we took from Claypool's office.
can I ask you who that's gonna be?
Claypool's angry. He lost face. He's probably gonna insist on Ilsa.
Oh, Ilsa. - What?
listen, Chance, if I thought you were about to get into something that was gonna get you, me, and Ilsa killed, you'd want me to tell you about it, right?
what are you talking about?
I think you're off your game.
why do you think I'm off my game?
Uh,"A," handcuffs."B," bomb.
didn't I tell you about what I did back there?
the stuff in the office, with the horse a lot of people would have been impressed with that.
they obviously don't know you.
all right, now I'm starting to get a little offended.
it's a very complicated case.
there are a lot of moving pieces. That's why I got caught.
no, I think it's for another reason.
which is?
I think you were uncharacteristically lacking in focus on this job.
I think--I think your judgment's clouded.
examples? You slipped in the office.
you said you nearly fell off the table going for the computer.
I was distracted.
you really can't see it, can you?
you were distracted because you knew Ilsa was off-book, and she drank the wine.
instead of concentrating on the jump, you were worried about her.
okay, Harry, listen - No, no, no, you listen. You listen to me.
when I asked you why you let Ilsa come on the mission, you basically dodged the question.
I think the reason you let Ilsa come is 'cause, when it comes to her, you're not in control.
the reason you got caught is cause you're realizing that you got feelings for your boss.
speak of the devil.
here we go.
chance, get your head in the game, come on.
forget what I said about her. You need to tell me what to do.
Harry, I need you to buy me some time.
I came alone, as we agreed.
you give me the files, and you're both free to go.
it'll all start to make sense soon enough, Harry.
remember when I told you that?
it's all here-- uncorrupted, hasn't been copied.
now let him go.
on second thought, Mrs. Pucci, why don't you join Mr. Chance at the bar, because unlike last night, this time I'm perfectly capable of lying.
you're about to see why I wanted you to get the martini, the sock, and the bottle of scotch.
buy me ten seconds. - Okay.
all right.
Hey, who wants to see a little bar trick?
easy, easy, I'm Harry Houdini. Observe.
I'm gonna take this tiny, little cherry stem and tie it in a knot with nothing but my tongue.
watch.
I'm doing it. I'm doing...
over there!
I don't mean to be harsh, but this is your idea of a rescue plan?
Really? You thought you could just waltz in here and exchange the file?
the word "double-cross" just never came up?
seriously, if you don't want to start getting labeled as an amateur, you're gonna have to start thinking these things through.
are you done?
Yeah...I'd say you are.
let's see an amateur do that.
Where's Claypool?
uh, you were saying?
Okay...I don't know about you guys, but I thought I handled myself pretty well...
amazingly well.
you're welcome.
detective's a buddy of mine.
I got him to leave Ilsa's name out of it, you know?
listen, thanks for the help.
I appreciate it, but just for the record,
I think Harry and I probably could've handled this on our own.
Yeah, right. Want me to tell him?
so, Harry, what were you doing here tonight, anyway?
Oh, I was supposed to meet a girl, but she didn't show up.
that never, ever happens...Ever.
Oh, I know.
what was her name?
her name is Laverne.
no. - Oh, yeah.
you sent Harry. - Yes, sir.
you were Laverne?
okay, listen...
I understand you wanted to help.
but of all the people to send, why Harry?
you think Claypool's guys would be on the lookout for any threatening characters approaching the bar?
Yeah, of course.
so let me ask you...
do you know anyone, anyone at all, less threatening than this man?
I'm right here.
less threatening and yet secretly, inexplicably guaran-damn-teed to fall ass-backwards into the lap of success.
well played. - Thank you.
let's get the hell out of here before we have to start answering a bunch of questions.
uh, there's-- there's one more thing.
look, I think I know why you had no interest in being set up on a date.
and I didn't notice it until tonight, but I think Chance may have a crush on somebody...
somebody on this very team.
listen, it's okay. I've had this happen before.
it's perfectly understandable.
see you tomorrow.
nice work today, by the way.
why is nobody taking this seriously?
Hey, um...I, uh--I know this might be kind of inappropriate, but, um...
they just walk away from me while I'm talking.
okay, okay, that's good. No worries.
you're not answering your phone.
uh, Winston said it was probably better that I wasn't at the scene when the police arrived. He said that...
Yeah, he took care of it. It's fine.
it smells like his rum cake in here, though.
I've had a bit to drink.
you don't have to say anything.
I know I shouldn't be doing this to myself.
Marshall had an affair.
had I never seen that photograph, I'd never have known it.
so why should I let one photograph send me into a tailspin like this?
he and I were happy together. We had a good life together.
I should be able to remember him like that, shouldn't I?
Yeah, you should.
so why can't I?
I- I don't know how to answer that...
question, Ilsa.
what I do know is that...
if Marshall did cheat on you, he--he was an idiot.
and for what it's worth...
you deserve a lot better than that.
I-I don't think it's a good idea to mix, um, rum and thiopental.
good afternoon.
I think, with your friends' welfare on the line, you give me exactly what I want.
you know what to do, right?
gonna get him back.
well, Mr. Winston...
you look very presentable.
I am sorry... That it had to come to this.
what you had to go through these last 48 hours in order to tell me the truth...
I just can't help but think how much better your life would have turned out if you'd never met Christopher Chance.
enough chitchat.
let's go get my book.
next.
how can I help you, sir?
Morning...Denise.
I'd like to make a withdrawal.
certainly. I can help you with that.
how much? - Uh...Everything.
I'd like to close my account. - Sorry to hear that.
may I ask why?
well, I'm gonna be leaving town for a little while.
relax. I'm one of the good guys.
chance, they're comin' out.
Denise, would you be a doll and reach under the counter and trip the alarm, please?
what's up, bro? Can't let him get to the door. This could get messy.
Denise, I'm not gonna shoot you.
just reach under the counter and trip the alarm, please.
what happened? Where's the sound?
it's a silent alarm. - You're kidding me.
well, now that you got what you came for, answer me one question.
what the hell is in that book? - Secrets, Mr. Winston, things the world does not need to know.
come on, dude. It's now or never.
stay down!
what the hell's going on?
these guys are trying to rob the place. Keep them covered.
Mr. Chance!
I was expecting you.
don't do anything stupid.
just wanna show you something.
So...You're gonna put your guns down.
and we're gonna walk outta here with my book.
or you'll be picking up pieces of him for weeks to come.
I'm sorry for getting you into this mess.
sorry for whatever torture you had to endure because of me.
most of all...
I'm sorry about Aunt Suzy.
aunt Suzy?
Oh, man... Not aunt Suzy.
you got him? - Yep.
drop your weapons! - Put 'em on the floor!
down. Put 'em down!
stop, dude!
drop 'em!
smart.
you gotta get this thing off me, man. I don't wanna die.
you know how to diffuse it?
no.
either way, this is good-bye.
what?
you ready? - I'm ready.
chance! - We gotta get out of here.
wait! Where's Chance?
that's it for Chance, bro. - What are you talking about?
what do you mean? - He's gone.
dude got too attached. That's the last you're ever gonna see of Chance.
come on. Come on.
come on, Winston. Let's get outta here.
left you too, huh?
you boys looking for protection?
we're looking for Christopher Chance.
gone.
when will he be back?
well, that's a good question.
I work for a single employer, a person of great means, who is in need of Mr. Chance's rather...
specific services.
any idea where I might find him?
I don't think you're gettin' it.
you see, when I say he's gone,
I don't mean he's down in Florida taking some R&R shacked up with a lady friend somewhere.
I mean gone. Forever.
might as well be dead.
you could search the end of the earth, and you wouldn't find him.
got that? - My employer's very persistent.
thank you.
we'll be sure to check the end of the earth.
wiseass.
six MONTHS LATER NEPAL
he has found his peace.
his inner Chi.
how long has he been in deep meditation?
he hasn't moved.
for three days.
I'll give it to you, Mr. Chance. When you say you want to disappear, you really commit.
it's taken me six months, an embarrassing amount of money, and more time in a helicopter than I ever dreamed my ass would spend.
so I have one thing to say to you.
you'd better be worth it.
while I appreciate the time, the money, and the discomfort of what must have been a very bumpy helicopter ride,
I have to tell you that I'm out of the protection game.
I'm retired. - Yes, so I've been told.
it's a 30-hour flight home.
albeit on a private plane.
all I'm asking is a few minutes.
you get two minutes.
eight months ago, my husband was killed in a plane crash, and I believe he was murdered.
my husband's name was Marshall Pucci.
you've heard of him. - Software billionaire. Philanthropist.
runs the world's largest charity.
I haven't always lived in an ashram.
well, along with his fortune, I've also inherited his enemies.
Mrs. Pucci, I'm sure your husband was a good man, but if you'd done your research, you'd know that I'm...Not.
well, I know that Christopher Chance isn't your real name.
I know that you used to be an assassin, and I also know that you're the person people come to as a last resort.
charming as Nepal is, I wouldn't be here if I had any other choice.
you have other choices. There's a variety of other people you could have hired.
Yes, I have. All of them.
now I can't leave the house without 20 bodyguards.
the windows in my home are sealed shut with bulletproof glass.
I don't want to live like that.
I want someone who's going to put me in the line of fire...
risk my life so that I can have it back.
right. I don't know how you found me here or who you spoke to - I'm actually kind of curious about that
but you should know the people who go into business with me have a tendency to get shot at, tortured, or...worse.
I'm not afraid.
that's what they all say. - I'm not like your other clients.
your two minutes are up.
I can't imagine what brings a man like you to an ashram.
but I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.
thank you for your time.
you know, I thought you'd be different.
taller? - No.
younger? - No. Braver.
Mrs. Pucci.
did you say private plane?
Mrs. Pucci, this is Laverne Winston.
his former partner before he went on vacation.
pleasure.
I apologize for the condition of our office, Mrs. Pucci.
we recently had a break-in- it's been six months.
you haven't replaced the windows yet?
you have to excuse my partner.
he doesn't really comprehend the basic principles of business.
you see, when the asset just runs off to an ashram, well, then there are no clients and therefore no revenue, and thus, no windows.
except now you do have a client.
Yes, of course. So Mrs. Pucci, tell us, why do you think someone's trying to kill you?
I was in Geneva on my way to Africa when my husband called at the last moment and told me not to come.
He...hired Peter here to watch over me.
I thought he was being paranoid.
the last conversation we had was an argument over my security.
anything since? - Several weeks back, she had a tail.
when we tried to approach the target, he fled the scene.
killed one of my men. Professional hit.
okay. This doesn't make any sense.
what part? - Well, all of it.
this guy couldn't have been a pro if you spotted him, but now we're saying your man was killed by a rank amateur.
I assure you, if anyone can take out one of my men, he's a professional.
maybe he wanted us to find him.
exactly. Why?
isn't that your job now? - Fair enough.
so why would an assassin want to be discovered?
your thoughts.
let us meditate on that.
in the meantime, we're going to have to get you exposed to the public,
Mrs. Pucci, get you out from behind that bulletproof glass and security and see if the threat re-emerges.
well, my husband and I usually throw a...
an annual charity event at this time of year, and it's been vital to the organization.
great. We'll throw a party and pray somebody tries to kill you.
Mrs. Pucci, this is a terrible idea.
you'll be exposed to countless threats, and that's just the guests.
exactly. We'll just open the door and let the rats come running right in.
I'm sorry, but there's no way that just the two of you can guarantee her safety from hundreds of possible assailants.
you're right. That's...ridiculous.
it won't just be the two of us.
we got another guy.
talk.
for you, bro, always available.
Just...gotta move some things around.
Hey, dude, welcome back.
good to have you home.
well, today is your lucky day dude.
it's like a damn security convention in this hotel.
it's fine. Any hitter worth his salt will have no problem getting in here.
Hey, you got that little, um... - Oh, yeah.
there's the guest of honor.
Mrs. Pucci.
nice dress. It's gonna make targeting you a breeze.
I'm just trying to make your job easier.
So...how does this work?
well, I'm not a big fan of game plans. I kinda like to wing it.
but if you just remember one simple rule, everything's gonna be okay.
and what rule is that? - Do exactly what I tell you.
not exactly my strong suit.
and it's okay to be afraid. - Of course I'm afraid.
what sane person wouldn't be slightly worried about being killed?
Oh, I see. You're not scared at all.
do you want me to think you're that brave?
no.
everyone's afraid to die, Mr. Chance.
unless, of course, for some reason they think they deserve it.
Ilsa. My lord, this is ridiculous.
the party's gonna be hell on my nerves.
listen, we need to go over some ground rules right now.
Shelly, this is... - Her new man.
you're the bodyguard.
Yeah, Pete told me. I'm in the loop on everything.
Shelly's my husband's lawyer.
um...And your lawyer.，as well.
so listen, there's gonna be major players here tonight, okay?
I need you to be accessible. I need you to be charming.
I need you to be...You.
I think I can manage that.
Shelly...You can relax.
uh, not gonna happen.
you pay me a fortune to be a nervous wreck, so...
Oh, it's okay. He's with me.
sup, bro? - Hey. M14?
.308. - Nice choice.
so what's the plan? - Gonna parade her around the party, see if anybody tries to kill her.
beautiful. Perimeter?
basic in and out. - Sweet ice.
hot. See why someone wants her dead.
that's Guerrero. He's got a dark sense of humor.
shall we, Mrs. Pucci?
lovely to see you. - Thank you for coming.
excuse me!
what the hell's going on here?
why are you letting these guests in without checking their I. D?
what, they tell you their name, and that's good enough?
I wasn't told to check for I. D.
some things are implied in the job description.
wait a second. This list is just names. No photos?
this is the list I was given.
it's not your fault, but it is someone's fault.
I'm gonna go upstairs and find out what the hell is going on.
I. D. Everyone. Got it?
eyes open, everybody.
the rat might have just taken the cheese.
the perp is female.
early 20s, blond hair, 5'3" in a security uniform.
keep your eyes open.
got it. - What's wrong?
good news. Somebody here wants to kill you.
okay, so now what?
have you spotted the person in the room? Are they here?
remember the first thing we talked about, the one rule?
doing everything you tell me. So tell me, what do I do?
we mingle.
Mrs. Pucci.
I just want to say thank you.
the hospital your husband built in Karachi saved thousands of lives, including my own child.
I am forever in your debit.
that means so much to me. Thank you so much.
Ah. You speak punjabi? - Yeah. Just enough to order a samosa.
Winston, check him out.
that man's a poor villager. - Your hospital's in Pakistan.
his dialect was from Afghanistan. You see the shoes?
a little excessive for a poor villager.
you think he wants to kill me because of his shoes?
it's just my process.
it's nice of you to open up a hospital, though. That's a pretty dicey area.
first we overthrew the local mullah, instituted a new regime, then we built the hospital.
how'd you do that? - We all have a process.
Ilsa. I need to introduce you to someone.
filthy rich.
Ilsa, this is Lars Nielsen.
very pleased to meet you. - And this is...
I can't tell you what an honor it is to meet you - everything about you I love.
no, seriously, your fashion sense, your generosity.
pakistani guy's clean. He was born in Afghanistan.
shoes are his brother's.
meeting you is a really big deal for me.
Oh, it's lovely to meet you too.
let's go.
brunette. Gray dress. That's your security girl.
grab her. Be careful.
look at me. Focus. You all right?
apart from you squeezing my arm?
let's dance.
listen, something has happened, but I'm not sure what.
feel a pinprick? - No.
look, there's nothing wrong with my arm.
what about this ring?
my husband gave it to me two days before he was killed.
is there something wrong?
Yes. No...Maybe.
I don't know what it is yet.
don't run.
I hate it when they make me run. Hey!
east staircase. Moving fast.
you sayin' you need a little help there, Winston?
I'm simply describing the perpetrator and approximate speed of travel, wiseass.
I'll get her. - Yeah, no doubt.
if she stops for a bite to eat, you'll catch her.
that was a warning shot. You take another step, it'll be your last.
help! I think that guy's trying to kill me!
get out of the way!
are you security?
Oh, my God, there's a guy coming down the stairs right now.
he's got a gun. I think he's trying to kill me.
Oh, my God, w-where? Back there?
Hey, you didn't...
I didn't... Need your help.
course not.
we got her.
we may have the suspect.
found a pink diamond on the girl.
it's Ilsa's ring. The girl must have switched them out.
question is why.
get down.
they're not hitting anything.
isn't that a good thing?
get down! Are you mad?
either the sniper is blind or he's not trying to kill you.
you all right?
chance, we gotta get her out of here!
that's exactly what they want. This is some kind of diversion.
we can't risk your life on his guess.
Ilsa, the safest place for you to be right now is right here.
let's go.
hold it right there! Whoa, whoa.
I've lost Ilsa. She's in the elevator.
on it.
Guerrero, talk to me. What happened?
they got her, dude.
chance, they got her.
nice digs.
so what's the deal here?
you guys aren't cops.
you're above the law?
seriously, I'm really digging the whole tough guy bit.
it's hot.
you stole this ring off a woman who's been kidnapped.
how painful do you want this to get?
okay. Look...
I think you and I
we got off on the wrong foot.
what are you gonna do with that?
you gonna hit a defenseless girl again?
huh, tough guy?
you're going through what I call the five phases of fear.
Denial...Anger...
frustration, acceptance, and eventually fear.
now, who hired you?
her name's Ames.
lifted her print off the ring.
that's some rap sheet.
almost didn't recognize you.
you were arrested five times as a juvie.
remember me?
of course. Slowest cop on the street.
Yeah, I gave you a shot once to go clean.
let you go for a b&e.
I see you've turned out well.
Yeah.
you too, cop.
lose the cuffs. She'll only pick 'em.
come on.
open!
better use duct tape.
we need it fast, Guerrero.
hold on.
you're Guerrero?
sorry.
listen, I'm gonna have to speed this up.
need to get to phase five a little quicker.
all right, thanks.
P. D. doesn't know anything.
car was dumped a few blocks away.
no prints. Nothing traceable.
at least we know that they're pros. Too bad the same can't be said about me.
Hey...This wasn't your fault.
look, I know you're trying to be my friend right now, but it is my fault.
I'm supposed to be one step ahead of everybody, and I'm the one who lost her.
we lost her. We are partners, and we will get her back.
now, what do we know?
we know they don't want her dead.
they probably had the girl switch the ring to put a tracking device on her so they knew exactly where she was so she wouldn't be killed during the shooting by accident.
so she has value alive.
now, what if it was politically motivated?
her husband does a lot of charity work in some very shady east Africa areas.
no, it's not political. There's too many pieces.
Plus, these guys are highly funded.
so it's about money.
okay, let's play it out.
can't be ransom. Nobody to pay that.
okay. Most billionaires don't do their banking at the local branch.
what accounts did he have?
I will see what I can find out.
also check with your guy at SFO.
see if there's any private planes that left in the last five hours.
these guys aren't afraid to kill.
once they get what they need from her, she's dead.
look...I want you to know that I'm not scared.
but I do have a lot of respect for you, so...
I'll talk. - I know.
I'm a thief, okay?
I-I can steal anything.
no safe I can't crack, no wallet I can't lift.
ever since I was a kid, my dad...
I'm not interested in your pathetic, predictable life story.
last night.
I was hired to meet that woman and switch her rings.
it paid good, and I didn't ask questions.
I didn't know anything about a kidnapping.
no gunshots, no murder
I'm gonna give you a choice...
cause I believe in every human being's right to being tortured democratically.
peel your fingernails off with this...
or shoot you in the kneecaps.
I have a preference, but I'm gonna leave it up to you.
it's your body. - I'm telling the truth.
it was a clean switch. Easy gig.
okay, you know what? You win.
I'm actually scared now.
all right. Hey.
I won't do the fingernails.
it's too gruesome.
let's just do the kneecaps. Okay?
cool with you?
no, please! It--it was fat Tony!
he contacted me two days ago.
Please...Don't do it. Please.
okay.
all right. You can relax.
unless you're lying.
then you should be sufficiently nervous.
Pucci has accounts in London, Tokyo, and Singapore.
no, it's too obvious. Interpol would be all over those banks.
Yeah. What would you need Ilsa for?
Hey, we got a problem.
girl says fat Tony hired her to switch the rings.
I'm inclined to believe her. - Why? He corroborate it?
more or less. Fat Tony's dead.
Yeah.
okay. Thanks.
four private flights left SFO last night.
one to Aspen, two to Vegas, and one with a flight plan to Geneva.
Switzerland. Isn't that where her husband's plane went down?
champagne?
can't tell you how many times I've been on a private plane with your husband, and not once did he ever offer me a cocktail.
just work, work, work.
where are you taking me?
well, if I tell you, I'd have to kill you.
sorry. Bad joke. We're going to your bank.
need to make a small withdrawal. - London？
not that bank come on.
think I've been planning this all these years just to make a few lousy million?
hardly worth my salary.
I'm a Harvard graduate. Give me a little more credit than that.
we're going to your other bank. - What, Geneva?
that's our private vault, our personal items.
there's not a lot of money there. Less than in London.
besides, you'll never get in. It's been secured with
iris scans. I know.
I haven't switched the biometric identification.
you still need both of us to access the vault. - Oh, my God.
I know you haven't updated security.
I hate to ruin the surprise, but you just... Keep on prying.
your husband will be meeting us there.
what?
care to reconsider that drink?
what do you wanna do about the girl?
think she's telling the truth?
professional opinion? - Yep.
cut her loose. - I wouldn't do that.
need to turn her over to the cops.
girl is unsavable. Believe me, I tried.
no cops. Not my style.
easy, boys. Word of advice.
use both duct tape and cuffs.
look, I heard you say they killed fat Tony.
that means they're coming after me next...
clean up all loose ends.
she's right. Might wanna lay low.
if I leave here, I'm dead.
can I stay here? Borrow a gun or something?
hell, no!
can't trust her. - Oh, really?
cause I could be halfway home by now, cop？
besides, I heard you say something about a bank.
I'm pretty good in banks.
guys, we know we can't trust her, but she's got chops.
she switched out a ring right out from underneath my nose.
if we're gonna pull off an Uncle Andy, she could be useful.
uncle Andy?
cool. We're gonna need more firepower.
you do realize this gentleman is more dangerous than the people that hired you?
I'm aware. - Good.
we got an understanding. You got a passport?
how many do you need?
seriously. Uncle Andy? I don't get it.
how are you guys related?
geneva, SWITZERLAND 36hours later
Bonjour, monsieur.
bienvenue, mademoiselle Pucci.
this is so lovely, don't you think?
I've done my part. Now it's your turn.
Where's my husband? - Deal's a deal.
my God! - Told you he was coming.
got it. We can go now.
my husband's briefcase. That's what you were after.
like I said, Ilsa, anyone can steal a few million, but billions...
that's where it gets tricky.
inside here is everything I need to become Marshall Pucci.
or at least have his stuff.
deeds, titles, account numbers, pass codes to his banks.
guy never trusted anyone except you.
maybe he was right to be...
a little suspicious.
no.
no what?
when I walk out that door, you have no use for me.
okay, can we just hold off on the drama, maybe discuss this outside?
if I'm gonna die, I want you to do it now.
kill me.
what's the matter, Sheldon?
you can have the title, the deeds, all the money in the world, but you'll never be my husband.
you don't have the spine.
what the hell is she doing?
she's making her stand.
how do you wanna play it?
woman refuses to do anything the way I want her to.
switch to an Uncle Billy.
sweet. Diggin' Uncle Billy.
I hate an Uncle Billy.
so if I'm just lookin' for some club music, you know, like, nothing too sceney, just, like, a place to chill...
just give me a couple minutes to get into position.
excuse me for a second?
sorry, guys.
still here. Not in your family.
what in the hell is an Uncle Billy?
guard has an access key to the stairwell. Try and keep up.
Bonjour, tout le monde. Je vole cette banque.
Voudrais, s'il vous plait, sur la terre.
how hard can this be?
there are four of you. One of you shoot him.
the man's got a gun.
Yeah. Slight change of plans.
need the helicopter on the roof - now.
block him!
stay right there. Take one step, she's dead.
okay.
let's just calm down here. We can work this out.
Yes, we can.
provided you put the gun down.
promise you won't kill her. - Sure. Absolutely.
can I just ask you one question?
what was your game plan?
or did you even... Have one?
not crazy about game plans.
Seriously?
I'm genuinely curious.
you thought to come up here by yourself and shoot us?
Oh, I didn't come here by myself. - What?
I brought another guy.
got him?
course, dude.
you trust me?
Yes.
sorry, Mrs. Pucci.
you know, normally we're a lot more professional than this.
no, we're not.
you okay?
fine.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude. After all, you saved my life.
no. It's all part of the game plan.
jumping out of a 12-story building?
game plan's not for everybody.
I'll give you some... Space.
Mr. Chance.
why do you do it?
dive out of buildings in front of bullets, put your life on the line?
it's part of the job. It's what I'm paid to do.
I don't think you do it for the money.
there's a lot smarter ways to earn a dollar.
I'm not very bright.
but you are brave.
you must have a lot to be redeemed for.
I do.
all right, flights. There's a 5: 00 that can get us home.
there's two connections. - No connections.
okay. Oh! Here's a 9: 00 but...
Oh, nothing but middle seats. I don't do middle.
think I'm gonna stick around, look up a few friends.
Really? - Yeah.
who do you know in Geneva?
got people everywhere, dude.
Mr. Chance.
great. Here we go.
you know, I've been thinking.
I could either return you back to the ashram or to any other place you desire.
or... - Why did I think there was another option?
or you could work for me.
not for my protection.
I imagine there are a lot of people all over the world who could use your...
specific non-game-plan services.
but I could do that on my own. Why would I want a boss?
don't think of me as a boss. Think of me as a benefactor.
someone to bankroll your redemption.
besides, I've seen your office.
with me, you could do it with a little bit more style.
and your team would have access to my planes, my cars, my purse.
I-I'm sorry. Did you say planes?
man of my length can appreciate private air travel.
Yes, I could even throw in some new windows for the office.
look, I don't know.
you have my word. I would be an absentee owner.
what's the matter? Don't you trust me?
I was just returning Mrs. Pucci her bracelet!
I'm with these guys!
part of the team! Right? Tell them!
I'm sorry I left.
you know, the ashram and all that...
are you looking for more than this? - Yes.
I was wrong. - That'll do.
I don't know if we should have given her carte blanche on changing the windows.
I think I might have... Wanted to have some say in that.
she went a little overboard.
Oh, I can get used to this.
only problem is all these extra windows she put in.
you've still got a lot of enemies out there.
you need to stay hidden.
Nah.
no more hiding.
they can come and get me.
I'm not going anywhere.
everything's falling apart.
and it all starts right here in detroit-- the headwaters of a river of failure.
thank god my parents aren't around to watch the country they loved go to shit.
they were proud americans.
they had normal jobs and made a normal living.
they fit in.
they weren't kicked up the ass every day of their lives by property taxes and homeowners' associations and greedy beauty queen ex-wives.
what would I tell them if they saw me now?
that I'm not to blame? That's it's not my fault?
they didn't raise me that way.
they taught me to take responsibility and get the job done.
no excuses.
you do your best with whatever gifts God gave you.
anybody know what this is?
that's what I try to teach my kids too.
I'll give you a hint.
it's a scara... bae... inae.
anybody here take latin?
it's a dung beetle, team. All right?
so what's that make this?
dung? - Yes, it's dung, Schenken.
all right, but let's call it what it really is.
it's a ball of shit.
see, everywhere this little guy goes he takes his ball of shit with him.
he eats it, he sleeps with it, he talks to it at night.
that's just how he's wired.
so what's the point I'm trying to make here?
more man-to-man coverage?
no, Jerry. What I'm trying to say is that unlike this beetle, we as a team cannot afford to take our dung with us.
we cannot roll it up into a ball.
we cannot push it up a hill.
we shouldn't eat it.
we certainly better leave it behind when we get on the court tonight against the badgers.
shit happens, we know that.
Rodelle's girl just broke up with him.
Pazderka dropped a 40-pounder on his foot.
one more d in chemistry, and kuzneski's ass is on the bench.
we got heart, we got hope.
but it's not like we've been winning any games, fellas.
just like last year, it looks like every week we're going to get our teeth kicked in.
you okay, coach?
Yeah, I'm fine.
all right.
so tonight, let's leave our dung in the locker room.
let's pretend we're on the winning streak we're going to start tonight.
let's go out there and tear up some badger ass.
come on. Let's do it.
wolves on three. One, two, three... Wolves!
all right, let's go, guys. Let's go get them.
go get them, donovan. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
kick some ass. Come on, guys. Let's go.
Oh, god. - Ray? You okay?
Yeah, it must be my kidney stone.
I can't believe this is happening now.
should I call the nurse?
Nah, I'll be all right just help me up.
God. Jesus.
no, you're right. Better safe than sorry.
I'm gonna drive myself to a hospital.
you go out there and run the system.
but I don't know the system like you do, Ray.
put up some screens, get the ball to donovan. You'll do great. All right?
I'll try to be back by fourth quarter.
just go out there and kick some ass, Mike. Go.
okay, so I lied, and I'm missing a game during a losing season.
I'm not proud of it.
but desperate times call for desperate measures.
you know what a public school teacher makes these days?
okay, so maybe we make a little more in michigan than the national average, but what's the national average?
more than a waiter, less than a plumber.
it's about half of what it takes to live a normal life.
so what do you do when your career pays crap?
you do a side gig. Used to be stocks.
now ebay maybe. Tutoring.
me?
I've got a more unorthodox skill set.
I'm in the oldest profession in the world.
well, I'm about to be.
this is my first day on the job.
Hey, it's been a rough couple of years.
really rough.
it all started when Jessica slapped me with a divorce.
20 years, two kids-- a real punch in the face.
I had to kick the renters out and move into my parent's house where I grew up for christ's sake.
only bright spot was the twins who said they'd rather live with me.
then came the kidney stone that weirdly ended up in a prostate scare.
been having any trouble urinating?
then the wolves unprecedented losing streak, which every week brings me a new humiliation.
and then this prick lawyer moved in next door.
I'd already been getting grief from the homeowners' association...
but this guy was a whole new level.
welcome to the neighborhood. - Thank you.
you sure got a well spot.
say, I'm having a little open house on saturday.
Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you.
so I was wondering if between now and then you wouldn't mind tidying up your lawn a little and,
I don't know, maybe cleaning out your gutters.
fucker had me hit with three citations in the first six months alone.
nice to meet you. - You too.
fucker.
but nothing compared to this.
dad, wake up! Dad!
what? - Dad, wake up!
where the hell is she? Where is she?
you sure she didn't say where she was going? - Dad, I'm sure.
anybody seen my daughter?
I think this might be her.
who's that?
it'...
where the hell have you been? - Oh my god!
Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god!
it's all right. They were able to contain the fire.
Hey, you! Hey, you! Come back here.
who is that?
it's hammer. - Hammer? Who's hammer?
he's just a friend.
come on, Darb. Any guy named hammer is not a good idea at midnight.
and your curfew is 10: 00.
what did I give you a cell phone for, huh?
what did we agree on?
you always keep the ringer on.
you always answer when I call. No excuses.
dad, the battery died. - What did we say?
no excuses! What did we say? - Dad, stop. She's freaking out.
all right. All right, I'm sorry.
let's huddle up.
all right. We're all right.
are you wearing lipstick? What is that?
answer me.
what the hell's going on around here?
Jesus.
Hey, look, we're almost done here.
you guys really ought to get some sleep.
your insurance will pay for your hotel.
we've got insurance, right?
of course we do. We're not staying in a hotel though.
a burned-out house is a prime target for thieves and vandals.
we're staying here. Come on.
we're gonna sleep right here while we rebuild.
weather's not cold yet.
get to be by the lake. It's gonna be great.
we're gonna fish, we're gonna cook breakfast.
it'll be like camping only we're at home.
you want all three of us to sleep in the tent?
all right, I'll tell you what, later on today when we go shopping for clothes,
I'll buy you each your own tent. How's that?
are you calling mom? - Shit yeah, I'm calling mom.
the fire-- that's when I lost the kids.
how's it going? - Nice day.
what happened to my life?
I used to be a big deal.
I used to be going somewhere.
now all I ever seem to do is try not to drown.
when did life become something you buy?
say, Drecker! Drecker!
you never responded to my offer. These are tough times in real estate
would you mind getting off my property, please?
just trying to do you a solid, Drecker.
this is a teardown if I've ever seen one.
Hey, fuck off, Koontz.
you know where to find me.
I needed help.
so this pregna lady steps into my office. She's got psoriasis...
Dr. Ron haxon, dermatologist.
and she says, "doctor, my sister thinks I should try accutane. "
overcompensating little fucker who stole my wife.
fucker.
lotte brandt, my ex-mother-in-law.
looks sort of naked without her breastplate and horned helmet.
what is this one doing here?
Hi, Lotte.
does it feel good to you to almost murder my grandchildren in your lethal house?
no, Lotte. It's wasn't a good feeling.
why don't you just go away?
mom. Mom. Mom, relax. I can handle this.
Hi, Jess. - Ray.
what are you doing here?
just being social. You always say stop by, say hi.
so here I am. I'm just-I'm stopping by.
so how are the kids holding up?
Oh, the kids are great. They're inside playing wii. - Yeah?
they're loving it here, Ray.
don't you speak English? Go away. - Mom, please.
ray's welcome. We're just having a nice... talk.
we have no troubles here.
she wasn't always like this.
he's a doctor! He saves lives!
how many fucking lives have you fucking saved?
he's a dermatologist. Come on, Jessica.
we went to school with the guy. He's a turd.
you know he's a turd. - He loves me, Ray.
I love you. - Not enough.
put the fucking tulips back. - Fuck off, Ray. They're my bulbs.
take the rose bushes.
he's loaded, is that it?
you think I'm that shallow?
do you really think I am that shallow?
all right, yes, I am a little shallow.
but I am deep enough to admit it. I'm much deeper than people think, Ray.
and I am only shallow because I choose to be!
I am a beauty queen, Ray, a homecoming, cheerleading, stupid ass beauty queen.
and clearly I made the obvious choice.
clearly I was stupid enough to have completely bought into it.
what are you talking about?
God, you were magical.
in high school you were a king. - King?
you were beautiful and athletic and talented and smart and popular.
and hung.
what am I now, Jessica? What am I now?
now you're just hung.
so, Ray, is there a reason-- is there something that you need?
Yeah. I, uh-- look, this is hard for me, okay?
you know I've never asked you for anything before. I just need to
I need to borrow some money, okay?
What-oh my god, you're kidding. That's why you came?
what, they hiked your property taxes or something?
Yeah.
that and this fire thing is really putting me in a bit of a financial hole.
ladies, enjoy. - Thank you.
did you talk to your claims adjuster? - Yes. See, that's the thing.
I mean, there's been some sort of a mix up.
you didn't let it lapse again, did you? - No. I mean, sort of.
I had the envelope right there on the desk ready to go out.
Jesus, Ray.
hey there, coach Ray.
Hey, Ronnie.
how's the skin trade?
I can't complain. Can't complain.
Hey, I heard about your place, man. That's tough.
Yeah, thanks. I'm getting by.
just, you know, that house will be better than ever once I make the repairs.
glad to hear it. Just good to hear it.
Hey, Ray, you might want to have that mole removed.
you know, just to be safe. - Yeah?
drop by the office anytime. Don't worry, free of charge.
good to see you, Ray.
look, I'm already screwed with the property taxes.
now I've got to find a way to fix the house before the city slaps me with more citations.
plus I've got this jerkoff, this koontz sniffing around trying to get me to sell
and cheap too. - Sell!
sell the goddamn place, Ray.
you should have sold it years ago. - I'm not selling my parent's house, Jessica.
it's where I grew up. Look...
what I'm saying is, I've got my back against the wall here, okay?
I-I'm in the alamo.
I'm not asking for a handout.
I'm asking for a loan, you know, to tide me over.
I mean, if it was just me, shit, I wouldn't bother.
but I've got the kids to take care of. - You don't have the kids. I've got the kids.
well, until I fix the house. - No, for good.
they're gonna come back to me, Jessica.
I'm more fun and relaxed. You're too uptight.
having me fun with you almost got them killed.
all right, forget I asked. Just forget it. - Okay.
just wipe it out of your mind.
the Plan
learn
excuse me.
is this "unleash your inner entrepreneur"?
it is if you want it to be.
I'm going to tell you a secret right now.
it's you. The secret is in you.
each one of you has already proven that fact just by coming here tonight and you are about to become millionaires.
repeat after me-- I'm going to be a millionaire.
I'm going to be-- - no no no. I don't believe you at all.
come on, we can do better than that.
I'm going to be a millionaire.
I'm going to be a millionaire. - Hold it, hold it.
a million isn't what it used to be, huh?
let's kick it up a notch.
I'm going to be a multimillionaire.
I'm going to be a multimillionaire.
Yes! Yes, thank you.
sorry, I just-- I couldn't find the room.
do you want to be a multimillionaire?
because we all do. Tell her, class.
we're going to be multimillionaires.
welcome. - Thanks.
shit, what's her name again?
Oh yeah, tanya skagle. The poet.
night musket. The smell of fear thick in the air.
in the revolutionary sky...
the district had a program a couple years ago-- a grant.
you could get these so-called local poets to come to your class.
any subject, any time. I mean, these people were available.
so whenever you couldn't get your lesson plan figured out in time you'd just call in a poet.
that was lovely, Axel.
if this was English class we could discuss rhythm and meter, but for the purposes of history class,
I really feel like you captured the feelings of the common man fighting for a dream.
comments, anyone? Anybody?
I should've known better than to accept her invitation for tea.
Oh my god. Oh god, Ray.
Oh my god, you're so big.
the patchouli oil alone should've sent me running.
not to mention veganism and all the yakking and the coming that had no beginning and no end.
I never called her again.
it could be a talent or a gift or an idea for a product.
but the word I like to use is tool.
something that helps you get that very special job done.
so for next week, your first task is to identify your own tool.
then the following week we will begin to discuss how to market it.
everybody has at least one, so no excuses.
Tanya, how are you? Haven't seen you around in a while.
Oh yeah, the grant ran out.
I heard, yeah.
no more poets in schools.
I feel so bad for the kids, all the cutbacks.
uh, so you want to get some coffee?
maybe some tea.
Oh, your dick is so big! Oh my god!
Oh my god, Ray!
ray, you're so big! Oh my god!
I love this one.
there is some kiss we want with our whole lives, the touch of spirit on the body.
seawater begs the pearl to break its shell.
and the lily, how passionately it needs some wild darling.
I love that, some wild darling.
at night I open the window and ask the moon to come and press its face against mine.
breathe into me. Close the language door.
that's the mouth, the language door.
and open the love window. Those are the eyes.
the moon won't use the door, only the window.
Rumi, 13th century.
look, tanya, I've got to take off.
so is that your thing?
is what my thing?
you know, Ray.
being cold and distant after sex.
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not cold.
I just-I'm a little preoccupied, that's all.
okay, Ray, whatever. Just go.
you know, I don't know why I sleep with people like you.
you know nothing about my life.
you have no interest in getting to know me.
you seem to have the emotional range of a fucking 12-year-old.
look, tanya, I got a lot going on in my life right now.
I don't have the energy for games.
if you really wanted to get to know me, you wouldn't have hopped in the sack so easily. Twice.
what, so now I'm a slut?
no, but don't bring a guy home cause you're horny and then act all wounded and mystified when he doesn't stick around. I mean, you liked what you had the first time.
you wanted it again, fine.
just don't fool yourself into some romantic fantasy.
I liked what I had the first time?
Yeah. Unless I'm deaf.
wait, what is that supposed to mean?
I think you know what I'm referring to.
no, Ray. Why don't you enlighten me?
well, you know, you tend to come a lot.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing.
I'm not calling you a leper or something.
you think I come too much?
no, of course not. I'm just saying...
I don't even know why-- I'm just saying it's a lot.
it's not like you're some genius in bed.
is that what you're getting at?
no, I'm not getting at that.
I mean, okay, so you have a big dick. I mean, whoopee.
it's not the first time I've heard the news, tanya.
Oh my god.
you're an egotistical asshole.
I need to change my sheets.
you know, Ray, if you think that I was only interested in you because of your big penis, then all I feel is sorry for you.
I really really do.
big penis. What do you want, a parade?
okay, Tanya, I'll see you in class.
what an asshole!
Hey, Ray. Here's an idea.
you want to be a millionaire?
why don't you go market your dick?
she definitely meant it as an insult, but somehow I couldn't get the idea out of my head.
how straight, hey, dad. Knock knock.
jeez, look who showed up.
I didn't hear you coming. It's the damester.
are you drunk? - No.
I'm doing a little research on roof repair.
what you doing?
well, I was just on my way back from Milo's house and I thought I'd check up on you and see how the camping was going.
so have a seat, buddy. - No, it's fine. It's fine, thanks.
I was-I was wondering, though...
can I have 50 bucks?
50 bucks?
Yeah, godhead tickets are going on sale and a bunch of us are gonna go camp out in line.
what is godhead anyway? Is it one of your gothic overlords or something?
it's Goth, dad. Gothic is from the middle ages. This is Goth.
so you can camp out for godhead but not your old man?
I knew you'd say no. - What's that on your fingernails?
nothing, dad. It's kind of like a look, okay?
yeah yeah. No, I've been meaning to talk with you about that.
look, if you're attracted to-- you know, the lipstick, the nail thing, we should discuss it.
there's nothing to discuss. Forget it. I've got to go.
Hey, Damon, times are tough.
and your mother and I give you an allowance, you know.
hey hey, Damon.
I've lived a long life.
people are always asking me for my advice.
ed, my kid's on dope. What do I do?
ed, my wife's stepping out on me. What do I tell her?
et cetera, et cetera.
well, I've been helping people out for a long time now and I got to thinking maybe that's my thing.
I could take an ad out in the newspaper that says, "Ed Phipps, unlicensed therapist."
no nonsense advice from the guy who's seen it all.
then I'd charge by the hour instead of giving it away for free.
like a consultant.
good idea, Ed.
I can see you're off to a crackerjack start.
who's next?
well, I'm a poet, so what I'm good with are words.
some people don't value words as much as I do.
some people don't put stock in them and they can be casually cruel with them.
some people can be very cruel.
but I'd like to think most people are better than that.
so what is your idea, Tanya?
lyric bread.
using the fortune cookie as my inspiration,
I plan to create and market a line of baked goods with a short poem tucked inside.
a croissant folded around Maya Angelou's Phenomenal Woman, for example.
or a raisin loaf with Robert Frost's The Road Not Taken swirled in.
maybe some of my own poetry too.
lyric bread-- food for the body, food for the soul.
I like it. What do you think, class?
you might want to laminate the poem.
then again, you don't want that plastic taste in your mouth, right?
but other than that, I think you've got yourself a winner, Tanya.
certainly do.
what about you, Ray?
have you considered your winning tool?
Yeah, I've considered it.
I think I know what it is.
what I'm trying to figure out is how to market it because what I'm discovering is
slow down, Ray.
before we can help you with your dream, we have to know what it is.
you have to pitch it to us.
I'm not in the mood to pitch tonight, Floyd.
and I really don't think it's something for the group.
now what Ray is going through is very normal.
fear. It's a common stumbling block.
but the way to overcome it is to acknowledge it, validate it, and keep on going.
damn the torpedoes.
now without thinking about it, tell me, Ray. Say it.
what is your winning tool?
no, without thinking about it, say it. My name is Ray and I...
I've got a big dick, Floyd.
all right? I've got a big dick.
now what the hell do I do with the damn thing?
I'm not that smart. I'm not that talented. Anymore, anyway.
I've wasted my youth and now I look around and everybody seems to have accomplished something but me.
I don't have anything.
I got a burned-out house, a job that ps shit.
can't afford to pay my taxes on time.
I can't even afford to buy my son a ticket to a fucking rock and roll show, okay?
so I'm pretty much at the precipice here, and my big dick is all I've got.
got any advice for me?
okay, I didn't actually say that.
I said I was good with old cars.
wanted to be a mechanic. what a crock.
that night I swallowed my pride, bought a prepaid cell phone and a box of condoms and put an ad in the back pages of the Detroit Examiner.
and I paid the extra fee to include a photo in the online edition.
pick it up, Pazderka.
good. Nice, Makoski, nice. Come on.
Mike, take over for a second, will you?
come on, come on, come on. Let's hustle, let's hustle.
Hello?
uh, yeah, you got Donnie.
um, that's right, I sure do.
Yeah, I know where it is. Under what name?
um, okay.
wait, this friday? No, I've got a game. I mean, sure.
I'm game. Okay, you got it.
sorry, cash only.
and that is how Ray Drecker, teenage sports star from the legendary west lakefield class of 1984, winner of a full baseball scholarship to the university of central florida, recruited to the atlanta braves before being sidelined by ruptured ligaments, later the second winningest basketball and cross-country coach in west lakefield history, came to be standing in front of this door.
Hey, sugar. Donnie's here.
sugar?
sorry
Hey, lady!
Hey, lady, you think this is fun for me?
what do you mean you changed your mind?
look, I'm sorry.
I'm just-I'm sorry. I rearranged my whole schedule just to accommodate you.
Aw, forget it. You know what?
just forget it.
Thanks.
ray, is that you?
who's that?
it's me. It's Tanya.
Tanya? Christ.
how'd you know where I live?
the phone book. I tried calling but your number's disconnected.
now I see why. Look at your house. My god.
you were right about the poems. The ink runs in the dough.
I'll have to print them on plastic or something. I brought you a sample.
it's a gluten-free Neruda cranberry walnut bread.
thank you.
Oh, you also left your gel pen that day at my house.
so I thought I'd bring it back.
that's not my gel pen.
right, it's my gel pen.
Yeah, look, Tanya, I'm really not in the mood, okay?
ray, I didn't come here to jump your bones, okay?
I know we're not dating or anything. I just
I've been really concerned about you.
you were concerned? - Yeah. You haven't been coming to class.
why would you pay all that money and not go?
because I'm not very good with vintage cars, all right?
I lied.
that's not your winning tool?
Nope.
big Donnie. Will give you every inch of his love.
why are you showing me this?
that's my ad.
this is you? Are you kidding?
please tell me this isn't you.
you're the one that gave me the idea.
to be a man-whore?
ray, that's disgusting.
that's pathetic.
well, I'm a pathetic kind of guy.
look, Tanya, what are you, like 40?
I'm 38. - All right, then don't be so insulting.
okay, I've got some flaws, but you've got no job, you've got no kids, and you're about to start making a bunch of poem bread.
wait a minute. I do have a job. I'm an artist.
Yeah, but right now you're a temp. Right?
big Donnie
so did you have any luck with this?
Yeah, I went on my first thing today.
And? - And...
she changed her mind.
she wouldn't even open the door.
she just took one look at me through the peephole.
come on, don't laugh. - I'm sorry.
I don't think it's funny. I think it's sad.
it's lonely people. It's just not me.
you know, if you want my opinion, it's this ad or persona or whatever.
big Donnie? Are you out of your mind?
what kind of clients did you think you were gonna attract with that?
did I ask your opinion?
I'm just saying you need to sell yourself better.
and then you can get into a situation where you feel more confident and more protected.
and frankly, you need to add a photo.
I did that online.
of your face.
are you fucking kidding me?
Tanya, I'm a highly - respected educator.
nobody can know who I am.
ray, you missed the class in creative marketing.
there are so many different ways you can sell yourself.
look, if you want I can help-- when I'm not working on lyric bread.
you want to help me sell myself?
Yeah. I mean, not for free.
maybe for like a percentage of some kind.
you want to be my pimp.
Yeah.
Hey, Damon. Damon!
dad?
hold on. I'll be quick.
dad, what are you doing here?
just saying hi. Looks like you got a pretty good spot.
been camping all night, huh?
Yeah.
I thought this might come in handy.
Oh, no no no, Dad. It's fine.
Ronnie already gave me everything I needed.
look, you spend Ronnie's money on something else, okay?
this is for godhead.
you know, it might seem strange, but for the first time in years I felt pretty good.
you can't nick the Crown Jewels. -Why not?
why not? I'll tell you why not.
because it's unpatriotic for a start.
besides which, I don't fancy being banged up in the Tower of London for the next 300 years.
for once, I think Danny may have a point. -Yeah, thank you, Stacie.
what do you mean " for once " ?
if we get caught, they'll throw away the key, won't they?
exactly. I'm too pretty to go to prison. I'll never get any sleep.
call me old-fashioned, but I was hoping to avoid getting caught.
we're talking about the crime of the century.
there's a band of private collectors who are willing to pay a small fortune to add the First Star of Africa to their collection.
can we find them? -All in hand.
the First Star of Africa.
530. 2 carats. Also known as the Cullinan I...
because it's the largest of the nine stones cut from the Cullinan diamond discovered in South Africa in 1905.
it's now set in the head of the Royal scepter.
it is priceless.
home is the Tower of London.
there has only ever been one attempt to steal the Crown Jewels.
and that was by Colonel Blood in 1671.
what happened to him? -He failed.
great, so what are we gonna do? Swim the moat or scale the battlements?
no need. The Royal Scepter is being moved...
giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
why is it being moved?
right now it's being cleaned by the Royal Jewelers...
and after that it'll be moved again. -Where?
the Guildhall Art Gallery is holding a major African exhibition...
to coincide with the Commonwealth summit.
it starts the day after tomorrow...
and the Star of Africa is to be the centerpiece.
all right. Think of it.
the biggest score of this century or the last.
something that will be remembered 100, even 200 years from now.
everything I know, everything I've learned has been waiting for this moment.
nothing this big will ever come our way again.
the downside is, if we get caught...
we all go to prison for a very long time.
you all right, Mick? You on your own? -Yeah, looks that way.
Cheers.
if I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Really?
what did you expect?
you asked them to put the rest of their lives on the line.
Yes, I did.
you rolled the dice, they came up snake eyes. It happens.
Yep.
just tell me one thing.
Why?
because no one has ever dared attempt anything this big for 300 years.
and that's it? -For me, yes.
look, this is the biggest game in town.
if we're not here, we're not anywhere.
I can see that.
you see, Mickey...
I had my doubts earlier...
but you can count me in.
Thanks, Danny. That's worth a lot.
but this can't happen without Stacie and Ash.
glad to hear it.
was he sulking, Albert? -I'm afraid so, yeah.
diddums. -I was not sulking.
well, it worked, looks like you're getting your own way.
no, now, wait a minute, come on.
this thing is far too big for anyone to be here for any other reason than they want to be.
you can't bottle it now.
cor blimey, first he sulks, now he's trying to back out.
I'm not backing out, but...
if we do this, we do it with our eyes open.
Hey, if we can't do it...
who can?
Eddie. -On the tab.
so, is this a change of direction for you boys?
you're thieves now? -Just trying to earn a living, Benny.
tell me about it, there are no honest crooks anymore.
everyone tries to screw you.
me, I've been screwed more times than a coachload of hookers.
I see you still have a wonderful way with words, Benjamin.
don't talk to me about words, Mr. Stroller.
a handshake was enough.
now, everyone's 14, with spots and rings in their noses...
all using fancy words to screw you.
'five percent of this. Two pints of that. "
'ten pence in the pound and pay you next Wednesday. "
Yeah, it's a different world. -That it is.
me? I've had enough. Next year, I sell up.
let someone else get screwed.
so. The great Mickey Bricks and Albert Stroller.
call me a Chinaman but my guess is you don't have a bag full of car radios.
not quite. -So what is it?
the Crown Jewels?
please tell me you're not serious.
what we're looking for are a few select private collectors to put in sealed bids.
an auction? -Winner takes all.
how long have I got?
we've found the cleaning company who has the contract for the gallery.
they employ mostly Eastern European workers.
you mean cheap. -Precisely.
and you start tonight. Those are the details.
all right.
Hello? -It's me.
Benny, what have you got for me? -It wasn't easy.
I have to say that personally, I think you're insane.
but if you pull it off, I've got five bidders lined up.
all topnotch.
I knew you were the man for the job.
sealed bids will be delivered to your hotel.
okay, Benny, I'll be in touch.
well? -We are on.
thank you. That's blinding. No.
no. Believe me, thank you very much. -Danny, what are you doing?
premium phone line, 50 quid a minute. -What?
I set up one of these lines. Every time somebody phones this number...
I get 50 quid in me pocket.
but how are you going to get people to phone the number?
no, listen, this is where the genius comes in.
cause I don't have to, you see.
all I got to do, yeah, is I borrow a phone and I call the number.
Yeah, then they think I'm making a 10p call...
but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket.
Danny. -Yeah, Mickey.
you did stop me using the credit cards.
they were very bad copies. -But they did work.
we got thrown out of a restaurant.
granted, everyone, but I had a few teething troubles.
Danny, I would much rather you focused on the job in hand.
I'm focused, gang, I'm focused. This is just a little sideline.
make a little bit of money to buy some tobacco when you get us all arrested.
Eddie, can I borrow your phone, mate? Just got to phone me old mom.
Hello, Mom?
I'll be watching you.
I've just made a pot of tea. -Yes, thank you.
I will just finish my work.
you'll wear the varnish off, you polish it any more.
but I want to do a good job.
Yes, and you'll do a better job with a cup of tea inside you.
I will be five minute.
what is happening in there? -Some kind of special exhibition.
all very hush-hush.
practicing a few moves. -And the music?
get me in the mood.
it worked for Tom Cruise, didn't it? -Okay.
I haven't got in the chamber yet, but from what I've seen...
they've got motion detectors, lasers, CCTV...
pressure pads and a steel door with a time lock.
belt and braces security then. -So what's the bottom line?
it would have been easier if they'd kept it in the Tower of London.
it'll be okay, we've got Spiderman on board.
Yeah. Let's all have a good laugh.
listen, I'll be the only one who's match fit, okay.
Yeah, there's nothing we can do about the pressure pads.
we'll have to work round them.
the biggest problem, though, will be the doors.
once they're shut, there's no other way of opening them until the morning.
can we get in any other way? -No. It's a sealed room.
no windows. That's why they chose it. -Can we tunnel in?
no, that would set off the motion detectors.
and there's no way of bypassing them? -Yeah. If there is, I haven't found it.
so what are you saying, Ash? We should just call the whole thing off?
no. Just give me a bit more time. I'll see what I can do.
in the meantime...
I'm late for work.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hello, Benny.
this is an inventory of what was found in your warehouse.
and this is a list of items reported stolen...
in the Greater London area over the past seven days.
as you can see they're virtually identical. -I bought every item there in good faith.
in which case you'll have receipts, invoices.
names and addresses of suppliers.
we had a fire. -Oh, yes.
of course you did.
crime report.
a container-Ioad of computer equipment...
was stolen from the docks three weeks ago.
they found the container yesterday morning.
someone had tried to burn it.
kids these days. No discipline.
the fire went out.
we dusted for prints...
and you'll never guess what we found.
perfect match.
bang to rights, Benny.
how long, Mr. Wells? -With your form, fifteen years.
you take a guilty, you might get 12.
well?
wait.
what about a deal? -What kind of deal?
the imminent robbery of the Crown Jewels.
you saw how magnificent-- -You said it seven times.
no. -Mr. Morgan.
I'm sorry to bother you, only the manager wondered...
whether you could bring your account up-to-date?
it is rather a lot. -Yeah, it is.
I didn't have that. -You did.
did you have that? -I didn't, I don't like
who had that? -Enough. It's not a problem.
Hey.
put your hand in there, mate. Keep it in there, I'll get this.
thank you. -All right, you're very welcome.
listen, love, while you put that through the old switcherooney...
can I use your phone? -Of course.
got to phone me old mom.
Hello, Mom?
you shouldn't be in here.
but I have to do floors.
not in here, sweetheart. They're bringing other people in.
I am sorry.
I can see I'll have to keep an eye on you. Come on.
come and have a cuppa. You can try my Bourbons.
Mick. -Hey.
how's it going? -I've got blisters on me blisters.
no gain without pain. -Yeah, right. Thank you.
look, I think I've got it. There's a safety feature on the door.
the time lock's got a panel on the inside, in case anyone gets locked in.
so can we use that?
if we can get someone inside before they close it.
Hey, haven't you lot got any homes to go to?
just a few more minutes, Eddie. -Yeah, come on.
I need my beauty sleep. -Yeah, I'll second that.
do you want a drink? -Won't you be lucky?
Eddie, I just want to say...
that I really appreciate you hanging on while Ash and I work something through.
Yeah, I know, Mick, but it's really late-- -Look, I'll tell you what, okay.
we'll just have one more drink...
and I promise, we'll be out of your hair really soon.
what do you say?
come on, we'll be gone by 1: 00.
no, but it's gone on...
I could have sworn it was later than that.
go on, then, one more. -You're a star.
right, come on, tell me about this safety feature.
sir?
ds Hodges? -Yes, sir.
your DI tells me you were working on a case last year. Michael Stone?
look, we had Stone under surveillance.
but he found out somehow.
and drafted in another grifter to impersonate a police officer.
and the case collapsed?
stone's man ran the investigation, sir.
must have been very embarrassing for you.
it was embarrassing for the whole department, sir.
DCI Mullens lost his job because of it. -Did he, now?
so...
tell me about Stone.
long con artist-- -No. I know what he does.
tell me about the man.
Mickey Stone is unique.
he doesn't think like we do. You can't second-guess him.
he gives the impression that he's making it all up as he goes along.
no.
but everything is planned, precise.
why me? -You drew the short straw.
I demand a recount.
so when you gonna push me
he puts together complicated...
and seemingly unrelated events, impossible to unravel.
waiter, I'll have one of those.
but all leading to the big con.
the higher the stakes, the more he likes it.
Yes, it has been long.
just when you think you've got him...
I've got a job for you.
are you sitting down?
...you haven't. -You sound like a bit of a fan.
hardly, sir, he made me look like an incompetent idiot.
then how would you like to get your own back?
Oh, God! Sorry.
I tell you now, I've definitely caught something.
okay, this thing isn't going to work unless we can get someone inside the gallery...
and in the exhibition room when the doors are locked.
once they're locked for the night, the doors can only be opened from the inside.
which is where you come in. -How?
we can get round the pressure pads by going over the top.
the main problem, though, aside from the time lock on the door...
will be the lasers and the motion detectors.
like I said, there's no way we can bypass them...
and they'll set the alarms off as soon as we set foot in the room.
solution? -The only way round it as far as I can see...
is to cut the power. -Won't that set the alarms off?
Yeah, but if we do it outside somewhere in the road...
we'll knock out the whole street.
there'll be alarms going off everywhere. -Smart.
during that time, we'll have 30 seconds to cover up the motion detectors...
and get to the door panel to stop the lasers from coming back on.
will that be enough time? -It'll have to be.
once the genny kicks in, the lasers and everything else will be back on.
CCTV?
I can re-route those at source during the blackout.
good. -So, what do I have to do then?
the motion detectors and the lasers have to be disabled from the inside before we open the door.
the exhibition has five main exhibitors.
the biggest of which is Joyce Martin.
so what is your area of expertise?
I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces from the Niger Delta.
particularly the Iphri carved figures.
but, aside from the traditional...
I've always had a deep affection for some of the more contemporary pieces...
such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's epoxy resin etchings.
completely stunning.
who's been using my phone?
Mick, can I say something? -Yeah, of course.
I've got a really bad feeling about this. -How so?
I don't know, it just feels... -Foolhardy?
Yeah, that'll do for a start.
ash, this is the biggest thing we've ever done.
it was never gonna be easy. -Yeah, but there's so much can go wrong.
I know, but it won't. It won't.
okay, say it.
don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you.
I think you're a flaming genius.
but I have to say what I think. -And you think this is a bad idea.
it's what me gut says.
Hello, sweetheart. New face. How you doing?
thank you very much. Goodbye.
bids are in.
and Albie called, everything is set his end.
she's put me in charge of the items going on show at the exhibition.
so are we good to go?
Yeah. Tomorrow night.
the diamond, it'll be delivered to the gallery under armed guard tomorrow morning.
we know that Mickey Bricks and his team...
are going to steal it.
this is the first time that we've got a head start.
there is no way they can know we're onto them.
we must use that. -Okay, we know they're smart.
so no surveillance.
I won't risk them getting wind of this operation.
which means that we simply watch the gallery...
and wait for them to make their move.
does everyone understand that? -Yes, guv.
this team has made us look like fools too many times.
this time it's our turn.
I've found a place to cut off the power, but there's a problem.
what? -I can't be in two places at once.
at the same time the power is being cut off...
someone has to be re-routing the feed to the CCTV cameras.
can't you show someone how to do that?
no, it's best if I do it. Someone else can do the electricity.
okay, show Danny. -Me? No.
no, I have trouble wiring a plug.
it's all right. I'll talk you through it. We can use walkie-talkies.
okay, I'll do it. -Stacie, how you getting on at the gallery?
I've found a piece that's perfect.
Albert? -Everything will be ready.
okay, the exhibition opens tomorrow. So let's get some sleep.
we'll come in here. There'll be four guards in the control room.
one will be doing his rounds.
Yeah, there's no set time, so the chances are we'll have to get past him.
that done...
ash will give the signal to Danny to cut the power...
which will give us 30 seconds to re-route the CCTV...
and for Stacie to do her thing.
you must get to the door before the emergency power kicks in.
okay. -Or you'll be trapped by the lasers.
when you've done that, we should be on the other side.
I'd better go.
Albert? -Second floor.
and you must be on time.
we will. Any questions?
no. -Then let's go.
thanks for listening, sweetheart.
radio silence until further notice.
cleaning team.
on time.
you okay, Mick? -Yeah.
put that back in me bag.
all right.
maybe they're not going to do it tonight.
now what do I do?
okay. -All right.
come on, baby. There we go. -All right.
we're on, Mick.
now we'll tape it for a while and then feed the tape through on a loop.
okay.
Danny, come in. -Ready, over.
okay, that should be enough.
have you got the box in place?
hang on.
Yeah, I got the box in place.
when you put the clips on, nothing will happen.
then after 10 seconds, the power will cut out.
take the crocodile clips and clip them both on the
Vinny, where are you, mate?
I've got a pick up at 19 Chapel Road, West One.
Hello, you're on my frequency.
I think you'll find you're on mine actually, darling.
just get off the line, you dozy cow.
don't you use that tone with me or you won't get a cab.
I don't want a bleeding cab. Just get off the line.
who's that, Mary? -Some bloke messing about.
it's always the red. It's always red, isn't it?
come on. Or is it blue? Is it blue?
blue or red?
red.
what the...
good boy. Come on, Stace. You got 30 seconds.
12 elephant, 13 elephant.
16 elephant.
20 elephant.
25, 26 elephant.
30. Shit.
good. Okay.
cctv returned. It's all back up again.
all secured. -Okay.
Hello?
let's hope Stacie's done her stuff.
right, let's go? -Yeah.
thank you.
external power cut. It wasn't just the gallery, the whole sector was out.
security?
the emergency power is on and alarms have re-armed.
what do you want to do?
hold your positions.
I want to know if they're in there.
what's she doing? She should have opened the door by now.
something must have gone wrong.
come on, Stacie.
what kept you?
watch the pressure pads.
everything beyond this point is a pressure pad.
if we touch them, the alarms go off, all right?
you ready, Mick? -Let's go.
carry on.
down.
stop.
Hello, news desk, please.
lift.
okay, down.
stop.
okay, any time now would be good. -Yeah.
one for the scrapbook.
that's the cleaner's van again. -Shit, they must have been in the first van.
go. -Hit the alarms! Hit the alarms!
I knew it.
who the hell are you? -I'm with The Times.
we just received a call about a break-in.
get her out! -Yeah, okay, just one minute.
how many do you think were involved? -Please.
any ideas?
stay out.
there's no way they got out through any of the exits.
the roof.
Hey.
shit.
quiet.
do you mind?
dress.
they disappeared.
roadblocks? -They could be anywhere now.
okay.
it doesn't matter. -What?
think about it.
we know it was them.
but they have no way of knowing that.
which means? -They don't know we're looking for them.
I will bet you one year's salary...
they turn up back at the hotel. -They wouldn't be that stupid.
why not?
as far as they're concerned, they've got clean away.
I still think they'll be long gone. -We'll see.
guv?
Yes.
black cab just about to pass you, five people inside. I think it's them.
hold your positions.
wait for my signal.
that is what I call a great night.
I don't know about the rest of you, the old man's gonna hit the sack.
Yeah, I think I'll join you. -Really?
no. I don't mean I'm gonna join you. I'm gonna have me own bed.
I had no idea you cared. -I do care, I love you, Albert.
you said you loved me. Oh, my God! -Shut up.
listen, you lot do what you want, all right, 'cause I'm gonna get a drink.
cause I've had a very traumatic couple of days.
come on, then, I'll keep you company.
eye, eye.
stand still. Don't move.
what's going on? -You're all under arrest.
for what?
suspicion of theft.
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about.
take them away.
this way, please, sir.
...it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned...
something that you later rely on in court.
anything you do say may be given in evidence.
I'm a friend of the police commissioner. If you'd just call him.
bang to rights, Mickey, party's over.
wait in line.
I want to speak to my brief.
in good time, just stand there.
all right, who's first?
he's been arrested on suspicion of theft at the Guildhall Gallery at 10: 30 this evening.
name? -Ashley Morgan.
date of birth? -21/7/60.
address? -The Lexington Hotel.
empty your pockets out, will you, please?
you've forgotten something?
get this developed. -Sir.
take your tie off.
number three.
not quite as comfortable as the Lexington, but you'll have to make do.
all right, who's next?
police chiefs have just confirmed...
that five suspects have been detained for the theft...
of one of the world's best known diamonds, the First Star of Africa.
the priceless diamond, which usually adorns the Royal Scepter...
was recently moved from the Tower of London, to be placed...
as the centerpiece in a special public exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery.
resuming interview with Michael Stone.
9: 13 a. m.
so, Mickey, you've had a bit of time to think.
Yeah. -Is there anything you'd like to tell us?
nothing springs to mind. -Then I will ask you again.
can you tell me again where you were at 10: 30 last night?
it's slipped my mind. -It's less than 12 hours ago.
Yeah, I know, I've got a terrible memory.
I remember. No, it's gone again.
I'm terribly sorry, but my...
what's the word? Memory. It isn't quite what it was, you see.
what were you saying?
any chance of a fag?
a robbery? How thrilling. Have you caught anyone yet?
thank you, sweetheart.
look, I really have no idea what you're talking about, Officer.
interview suspended, 9:18 a. m.
Where's the diamond, Mickey? -Is that allowed?
Where's the bloody diamond?
what?
can I have a word, guv?
you might think you're clever, but I know you did this.
and I'm going to put you away.
with or without the diamond. -Sir?
I think you better see this.
it's the film we took from Morgan's camera.
testing. One, two, three, four. Can you hear me at the back?
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Police Courage Awards.
would you please make your way towards your seats.
and the ceremonies will begin very shortly. Thank you.
and now the last of tonight's civilian awards goes to a late entry.
someone who was brought to the Commissioner's attention only a few days ago.
thank you.
waiter, I'll have one of those.
a man who, without any thought for his own safety...
saved the life of a fellow rambler.
michael Stone and the man who's life he saved, Daniel Blue.
I was leaning down.
there was an injured duck, you see.
so there I was just trying to help...
just help the little fellow, when suddenly, I lost me footing...
and the next thing I knew, I was in the water.
why me? -You drew the short straw.
I demand a recount.
so when you gonna push me
I was drowning. Definitely drowning.
I can't swim. Help. -Hey.
my whole life started flashing before me...
I'd just left school...
and I felt a strong hand pulling me up.
there he is, there he is.
it was Mr. Stone.
he...
saved my life. Thank you.
doesn't mean anything.
we've got nothing to place them at the scene and no diamond.
they've hidden it. -It gets worse.
we know the diamond was stolen half a mile from the ceremony at 10: 30.
the Commissioner's watch.
it says 10: 20.
you've forgotten something.
that's...
that's not possible.
and then just at the end, they add the little sprinkles on top.
and that's what makes it a mochaccino.
you're free to go. -I'm sorry?
I said you're free to go.
okay. It's just come back to me, where I was
get him out of here.
nice to see you again. It's been fun.
it's not over yet. You still have to move the diamond.
and when you do, I'll be there.
where have you been? -Hey.
the nice custody sergeant, he let me use his phone.
come on, we haven't got long.
CID.
are you sure?
okay, thank you.
sir.
we've found the diamond.
Yes.
where is it? -It's still at the gallery.
Doris, how did we do?
five copies as ordered.
that's great, Lily, just one more, please.
I don't understand.
why go to all this trouble...
and not even take the diamond?
the British government are naturally very embarrassed by this theft.
so Ml6 has come up with a plan to invent a story to save face.
they'll say the diamond has been found...
and the perpetrators caught.
they'll then put a replica into the Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower.
Yeah, we're expecting the cover-up story to hit the press...
some time later today, just so you know.
so then, all that leaves me to do is to ask you, can I use your phone?
thank you.
Hello, Mom?
police?
I'd like to report the whereabouts of some stolen goods.
you got your amnesty? -In writing.
and Benny...
enjoy your retirement. -I certainly will.
Oh, ye of little faith.
you see, it's the perfect con.
there's no crime, so there's nothing to be arrested for.
and the only losers are five mugs greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds.
and when they find out they've been conned...
who are they gonna tell?
there it is, back of the net.
right, this is a toast. A toast to Mickey Bricks...
who is without doubt, a bleeding genius. -Worthy of any of the greats.
I still think he should have told us at the start.
the risk was the same. If you got caught...
who would have believed you weren't stealing the diamond, simply moving it?
will you take a look at that?
nice one, Lily. She deserved a bit of luck.
Yeah, it's beautiful, Ash, nearly as beautiful as the fact...
that I've now clocked up 93 minutes on my phone line...
which comes to 2, 500.
right on.
Hey. -Hey.
who paid the bill? -Danny.
with what? -Credit card.
please tell me you didn't. -What?
the police are downstairs...
and the receptionist is showing them a credit card receipt.
so, please, Danny, pretty please with knobs on...
tell me you did not use one of yours.
we better pack. -Danny.
we've just pulled off the biggest con of the century...
and we're sneaking out of a hotel for paying the bill with a bent credit card.
Yeah, blame me, why don't you? -We do.
I've had a very rough couple of days, you know.
all for the good of the team. I've been pushed in that bloody canal.
nearly drowned. I been electrocuted, nearly fried.
I've had a very harrowing time, I'll have you know.
are you lot listening to me? -No.
come on, Albie. -I'm coming, I'm coming.

OK. Of next...
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing where it drops really fast
are you sure maintenance fixed that?
let me check, yep, they fixed it
see you later
control headquarters 0745 hours - Hey Max - Agent 50
16 floors down, how can a fly get in here?
hey Max - Larabee, 91 - Yeah big day
could be your last chance to push a pencil
field agent test results are due - Is that today? - I wasn't really thinking about it
can you imaging Max as an agent? Little suit, little shoes
Oh, two nerd pileup.
pretty boys, nothing but empty suit - Good morning Bruce, good morning Lloyd - Why would you even wanna be an agent?
I mean, lab guys like us, analyst like you?
we are the real soldiers
we are the two guardians for freedom democracy
and hearing we're getting a new cappuccino machine
no, unfortunately, that's only for agents.
Hey, Agent 23 is back
thank you, thank you - Welcome back 23. So how was the assassination?
Max you know assassination are specifically prohibited by Executive Order 12333
23 you'd kill me - I could if I wanted to - Yes you could. Would you see that face he made?
scary 6 months" work, 18 million dollars
fucking agents, man
a lot of charter in this region involved nuclear material
you may remember from page 627 of my last report
but there has be an optic in KAOS interesting nukes
to wit, I offer the following conversation
what are you doing? Are you texting?
Yeah, just let my fiancée know we won't be able to get married in June'coz we'll still be in this meeting - Can I see it for something? - Yeah
that's great. That's weird, you've lost the signal
sorry to interrupt, Max, go ahead
next time use your own damn phone.
good morning man. No offence, Karen, Snappy tie
sorry I'm late, but I'm just came out of a budget meeting with incredibly abrasive dismissive and psychiatric Vice President
it's no problem. I have obtained a snippet
a great risk to a bus boy in Ballater - Azhab, how's your coffee? - Good Dalip,
it's decaf. How is yours
it is good, also. How is your muffin?
powerful stuff
so muffin then is a codeword
no, it is comfort food, and quite frankly much more fat mean than most people realize.
which begs the question why would two hardened KAOS agents risks the carbos?
because they are under a great deal of stress
hence the decaf
for Azhab yes. Dalip take his full strength
because he has been sleeping on the couch for three days
because he called his sister-in-law a "leathery hag"
you know people often say things in they don't really mean leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore, just words really, they shouldn't used against you on a chastity hearing
let it go man, those kids don't even like you.
can we put a pin in this, please? And go back to Max's extraordinarily detailed report?
thank you Chief, all I'm saying is that until we understand that...
our enemies are also human beings we will never be able to defeat them
yes they are bad guys. But that is what they do, not who they are. Let's continue listening and bear in mind that the next 100 pages can get a little bit dry come on

Oh, gee, Maxi-pad, I've never heard that one before
I never actually heard that before 23 you're bleeding
Oh, it's a knife would from last mission. My blood is pumped and it's started to seep.
Hey, Maxine, why don't come over here we'll play a little game
I'd like to call: let's go to the dog show?
I put a collar on you and make you my bitch
I think I really get inside his head
I am not proud of what I just did.
game over, chatty catty
game over. When I say it's over - OK - Where were we?
OK. Who wants lunch?
well, excellent work, 23, but I could have handle it my...
Max, the Chief wants to see you - It is nice to see you, too - You wanted to see me? - Yes, Max, yes, please sit down
your field agent test results just came in and...
something wrong with your ear - Absolutely not, - Would you like me to wait while you answer that - Answer what?
nothing. You were saying?
I was saying the results are quite extraordinary, in fact your essay on existentialism was quite amazing - I left that section blank. - Blank? Brilliant, brilliant Max
at any rate you passed with my cars
Yes!
you know what, sir? I can't say I'm shocked because I felt very good about this year's tests.
especially lying in the fact that in previous year my fitness is bad an issue.
personal best!
but not anymore. I'm ready for duty.
Max, I know how hard you've been prepared for this and how much it means to you
but, but I'm afraid I can't promote you.
I can't afford to give up my best analyst
I mean the amount the chartter you get through and the reports,
I mean they go way beyond the raw data.
so, to be clear, you're not promoting me because I do such a great job
Max, the way you and I work is becoming the lost art form.
you know half my days trying to convince the Vice President that intelligence comes from human beings and not satellites?
man with hunches that's where the real word get done.
I'm very proud of you, Max. Very proud of you.
and I need you where you are
I'm sorry but we can never be
despite today's setback, I will at some point become a field agent.
and when that happens, one phone call could take to the other side of the world
who am I kidding? I'm a little man who's missed the train.
you don't deserve this,
I don't deserve you
