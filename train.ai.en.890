or, as I like to call it, Trabble.
or Scravel.
I'm going to try and spell Trabble.
you can't. It's not a real word.
it's the name of the game, so I think I can...
you can't spell that. It's not a real word.
all right, then I'll spell Scravel.
you know what?
let's just play Travel Monopoly.
or, as I like to call it, Travopoly.
shut the fuck up.
where is he?
he said he'd be right back.
where is he?
can I ask you something?
Yep. Spill it, skillet.
that was stupid.
you're so stupid, Jason.
why are you so obsessed with my parents?
I'm not obsessed.
Brianna came to us with a dime.
it's our case.
Yeah, but you could have just told her to go home and that the police would handle it.
that's probably what I would have done.
Yeah, well, you're not a real detective, so...
neither are you.
well, your sister thinks I am, and I don't let down paying customers.
so this is all over 10 cents?
no. It...
when the Mystery Team first set up shop in my front yard, we started arguing about how much to charge for a mystery.
and then my next door neighbor Mr. Williamson came over, and he said, "It's not about the dime. It's about the people.
after that, we charged a dime, and we never changed it because he was right.
but he's gone now.
he passed?
no. He's in jail. Yeah.
something about pictures of kids on his computer. I don't know.
gross.
the lesson he taught was still valid.
Brianna really believes in us.
that doesn't happen a lot anymore.
Plus, don't you want to know who did it?
see him get hauled off to jail?
that's the fun stuff.
actually, no, I don't.
it was probably some really sick or sad person,
and knowing who did it isn't going to bring my parents back.
it's not like my bike got stolen and you're going to find it and everything's going to be okay.
where are your parents?
they died. What the fuck is wrong with you?
no. L...
in the picture.
what?
this is the same picture from your room, right?
Iphedolene?
what is that?
I don't know.
extremely toxic.
whose van is that?
that's Leroy.
hide.
if he ain't in here, you two are dead.
who's Leroy?
he's...
he's a drug dealer.
why is he chasing you?
because...he wanted to sell me drugs, and I said no to drugs.
and he was... he was steamed at me.
Duncan, I want to go home.
this is how my clown dream starts, and not the good one.
maybe we can climb out one of these windows.
don't you think we should wait for Jason?
forget about Jason, okay?
all Jason cares about is that stupid case and that know-it-all Kelly girl.
still cold.
someone was here.
wait. It's me.
Jason. - Yeah.
Jason, it's you.
Charlie!
why did you do that?
sorry. I had a delayed reaction.
bubbly bottle caps.
did you get the papers you needed?
Yeah. He did.
Hey.
what you got there?
I hope you enjoyed making your last mistake.
he's going to kill you.
shut up, Destiny.
where are you taking us?
how about you close your mouth?
Hey. Leave her alone.
sir.
I'm going to shoot you in the head.
I don't mean to me a bother, but could you please keep your eyes on the road?
I said shut up!
I'll take the wheel.
let go!
I can do it. I'm good at it.
let go, you cunt!
don't call me a bitch!
fuck.
you killed her!
you fucking...
run!
wait! His phone!
what are you doing?
wait. Where's Jason?
did we lose him?
keep running!
Kelly!
let's go.
is Leroy mad at us?
low battery. Son of a gun.
Hey, that was crazy, right?
it's not every day you see someone smash their head into a stop sign.
that was weird.
Yeah, what the fuck was that?
what the hell's going on?
look, a lot of crazy stuff happened, and I'm willing to admit that we may be a bit out of our league, so tomorrow we will go to the police and tell them everything.
thank you.
and thanks for sticking up for me back there.
that was really stupid but kind of cool.
Thanks.
to the lumber yard.
are you kidding me?
you just promised Kelly we would give it up.
I told Kelly that we would go to the police tomorrow.
we've still got tonight.
your word play.
look, the union is behind this, okay?
Kelly's dad was hiding that paper, and then Greg paid Leroy to get it.
okay, I don't know what it means, but the answer's got to be at the lumber yard.
a murderer shoved a gun in my face.
I know, and I appreciate that, but that document had a lot of scientific stuff on it, and I'm going to need help understanding it.
definitely a job for a boy genius.
the last time somebody said that,
I had to stick my hand in a toilet.
no toilets. I promise.
great. Let's roll.
roll on what? We lost our bikes.
I've got some extra bikes.
Duncan, the alarm.
okay.
bingo. We're in.
wire's cut.
perfect. Well, we won't have any interruptions while we're searching for clu...
shut up!
I'm out.
Hey. Hey.
wait!
wait, Duncan.
Duncan.
Hey!
would you stop?
two dead bodies, okay? That's my limit. I'm out.
okay. Wait. We have to see this thing through.
just go to the police and tell them the union murdered two people.
but they didn't, okay?
the door was open. The alarm was cut.
if they had been killed, there would have been way more blood.
why would you kill two people and leave their bodies for everyone to find?
if you wanted someone to find them?
exactly, okay? Someone else is behind this.
would you stop worrying about that and start worrying about us?
we almost died back there.
I squeezed a turd for you, and all you care about is this mystery.
well, forget it. I don't know about you, but I'd like to make it to see college next year.
wait.
college?
Yeah. College.
you're going to college?
Yes, of course. Aren't you?
no.
you didn't apply for college?
no. No, I didn't, Duncan. Charlie, did you?
Yeah. I'm going to U of M next semester.
what?
U of M?
when did this happen?
Jason, we visited colleges together.
I thought it was part of a mystery.
we took the SATs together.
what did you think that was about?
I don't know. L...
I thought we were goofing around.
you thought we were just goofing around?
Yes!
what did you think we were going to do after high school?
I thought we would open up our own detective agency in town.
that's stupid. Jason, we can't do this forever.
but we've got something really good here.
wake up, okay?
our lives are not that awesome.
our most consistent customer has Alzheimer's.
Mrs. Kimmel does not have Alzheimer's.
she bakes 50 pies a day for her dead husband.
most of the pies are filled with soap.
okay, well, granted.
if you look through our case files...
if you look through our case files, you'll see that we've been chasing 6-year-olds for ten years.
everyone else has girlfriends.
the only girl we interact with is Jamie.
Hello, trash can. How are you today?
shut up!
well, excuse me for thinking the disabled can be helpful.
everyone laughs at us.
you want to make it a career? Well, good luck.
I only kept doing this because I thought we were friends, but friends don't leave you with crazy, knife-wielding drug pushers in the middle of the night.
Hey! Knife fights, dead bodies, close scrapes.
that's real detective stuff!
you're not a real detective, Jason!
everyone's right about you.
you're pathetic.
you take that back!
don't push me, jerk!
Ah, cinnamon sticks.
Ah, Chinese checkers.
fuck!
Yeah. That's right.
I've been saying "fuck."
going in the backyard and trying it out.
it's pretty great.
you stay away from me.
you know what? I will.
come on, Charlie.
fine.
I don't need you!
I don't need either of you!
I can do this by myself!
I'm sorry, man.
I bought some firecrackers.
summertime tradition.
Hey, remember when I used to have to steal them?
that was half the fun.
now I'm so old, I can just buy them outright.
well, it's still fun, though.
here. Have one. Old times' sake.
what happened to you?
I got hit in the face.
Oh, man. You always have to be very careful around your face.
so close.
so close to my face.
this one's a dud.
born dead.
Jordy, can I ask you a question?
Yeah. Spill it, skillet.
do you think I could be a real detective?
Aw, Little Me.
Hey, guys like us, we're a different breed.
all right?
we live our lives, you know?
we figured out what we wanted to do early on in life, and we kept doing it in the exact same way, no matter what.
Yeah.
Yeah, Little Me, yeah.
you know, it's like think about it.
you love your detecting, and I love working here, you know?
when I was 15 years old, when I got this job,
I said to myself, "I am going to work here until the day that I kill myself.
and, uh, hello, I'm still here, so I must be happy, right?
it's our world, you know?
when my friends went off to school and when my parents just moved away out of nowhere, like, I stayed here and fulfilled my dream that I had when I was 15 years old.
and I don't know if you've looked around, but everything's pretty great around here, you know?
Hey! Are you squeezing that bread?
we got a deal.
we got a deal, you fucking animal!
Oh, dude, did you fuck this bread?
you fucked the shit out of this bread.
you don't fuck bread, God...
every fucking thing.
even that guy.
if you think about it, in his own way, he's living the dream, too.
you, me, the bread squeezer.
we did it.
Oh, thumb sucker.
Hey, Little Me,
I'm paying you in advance.
No! I'm not you!
I'm not you!
Brianna, let's go.
Jason?
Kelly. There have been so many developments.
downtown.
there have been so many developments downtown.
I think they're building a drugstore.
we should go when it opens.
what happened to your face?
and your bike? Why...
what's behind your ear?
my best friend hit me with a base,
I ran over a firecracker, and Mrs. Kimmel, uh, threw a pie at me because she thinks I'm her husband.
you know, Robert's a cyclist.
he could probably help you fix your bike when he gets back, if he has time.
Thanks.
Wow. You look nice.
where are you going, some kind of hot date?
we're going to the wake.
but thank you.
well, I guess between having your parents die and having a gun pointed in your face, this has been a pretty bad week.
Yeah.
honestly, I've just been, like, drifting by this whole week.
nothing even rates anymore.
they hit you with a base?
Yeah. Second base.
what happened?
those traitors couldn't handle real adult mysteries, okay?
they've always been one ring short of a full circus.
I don't... I don't need them.
it doesn't seem like you have a whole lot of other friends.
friends only hold you back, okay?
duncan and his lame "Penguins are from the South Pole, not the North.
sucks to you, boy genius.
and Charlie?
Charlie puts the dumb in dumbbell, okay?
he couldn't knock over the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
well, that's a building. He shouldn't be able to...
I was always the talented one.
I mean, I can do over a hundred different accents.
observe.
hello.
stop.
okay.
it doesn't sound like you're being very fair to them.
well, news flash. Life isn't fair.
if life was fair, I'd have gotten a new bike for my birthday instead of that stupid car.
life isn't fair. Get used to it.
Hey, I don't need to be told Life isn't fair, okay?
I'm going to a wake for both of my parents.
sorry.
I don't have a lot of friends, either.
we moved, like, every nine months since I was a kid.
duncan and Charlie, they seem like really good friends, that's all.
well, if you like them so much, why don't you marry them?
you know what? Maybe you should try to figure yourself out before you try to figure out a mystery.
Hey. How's the mystery going?
Yeah. Actually, we're going to hand it over to the police, Brianna.
they're going to take it from where we left off.
okay.
Brianna.
not true.
we still got it, okay? All right.
okay. Have fun at the wa...
l... I love you?
Bye.
I'll be 10 minutes behind you.
Jason. What can I do you for?
we're just two... men talking here, right?
we're drinking chocolate milk, aren't we?
Yeah, well...
when it comes to Kelly...
see, my other friends, they were too immature to get this, but...
I want to French kiss her.
that's pretty mature.
Oh, boy.
everyone take a chill pill.
man, you take a fucking chill pill.
can I use your cell phone charger?
mine's out of batteries.
sure. It's over there on the counter.
great.
l... I'll get it.
Thanks.
who was it?
one of your corporate buddies.
Yeah.
Yeah, there's a party celebrating the lumber yard deal.
it's kind of my baby, but I feel it's more important to go to the wake, you know?
Yeah. More important.
I got to go.
but your tire. We didn't fix...
that's fine. I like the bumps.
officer Mills!
there are two dead bodies over at the lumber yard!
I swear!
I'll go check over there around 10, okay?
no. By 10, it'll be too late.
you got to go now.
my friend lives with the murderer.
if it was anybody else, maybe.
if I'm going to trust you, I need proof.
Kelly.
Kelly, come in, Kelly.
robert is dangerous.
I repeat, Robert is dangerous, okay?
you have to believe me. Do not go home.
I'm going to Holden & Charles right now to get... proof.
if you are in a situation where you cannot respond, just... just beep twice, okay?
okay, Jason, this is it.
you have to be more convincing than you've ever been before.
hello. I am Juan Ranch-huevos, the Mexican plumber.
I've come to fix your pipes.
nice.
Hey. What are you drinking?
chocolate milk.
me, too.
two bourbons.
name's Jim.
medical Technologies. What division you in?
I'm in the lumber division.
lumber? This party's in your honor, man.
I'll drink to that.
you all right?
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
two more.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's like gasoline. I love it.
good. Good gasoline.
I want you to meet my friends.
Frankie. Come here, come here.
this is...
Juan.
Juan, Frank.
this guy's hilarious.
let's get some shots over here.
Yeah, buddy. - No, no. I got to go.
Juan, you are the life of the party, man.
you must be a real snatch magnet.
Yeah.
what does that mean?
guy good with the ladies.
who's your lucky lady?
no one.
there's...
there's a girl named Kelly.
Kelly-belly!
shut up, Frank.
this is why your marriage is such a mess.
she's really something.
it's just I'm... I'm no good with girls.
Oh, you're whipped.
Frank.
sometimes I wish you didn't beat that cancer.
I really do.
funny guy, but damn, you know?
you going to talk to this girl or what?
l... I can't do that.
Yeah. You can. Okay?
don't be like me.
I had a girl like that back in college, but I never told her how I felt.
now I'm with that fat piece of shit.
I love you, too.
heartless badger.
listen to me.
tell her you love her.
don't end up like me.
I'm pretty sad.
you are... You are absolutely right.
absolutely right.
I'm going to tell her how I feel.
you do it. - I will.
you do it.
first I got to solve a mystery.
what?
you're not supposed to know that.
what are you talking about, Juan?
I'm going to solve a mystery.
Iphedolene-treated wood.
what in the H-E-triple hockey sticks is this?
Duncan? Charlie?
my best friends.
how'd you guys get in the office?
we pushed the door open.
push? Of course.
boy genius, ladies and gentlemen.
are you drunk?
I'm a little buzzed, yeah.
you smell like Dad.
how'd you guys know I was here?
we heard you talking about Robert on the walkie.
it sounded like you were in danger, and Charlie wanted to come get you.
I guess he has a soft spot for idiots.
we heard the old "two beeps if you're in trouble" signal.
did you guys hear that?
who else has one of those? Kelly?
is Kelly here?
no.
Robert! - Henry!
Robert. Darn.
Iphedolene is toxic.
you were going to put hundreds of people in this town out of work so you could treat your wood with cheap stuff that kills people?
well, you, sir, are a grade A crumb-bum.
are you drunk?
I'm a little buzzed, yeah.
hand it over.
whoa. Hi.
you guys are hiding on your wives, too?
just kidding.
I'll go piss somewhere else.
Hey!
I'm holdin' my Charles.
holdin' my Charles.
I'll clean it up.
we're going to have to wait him out.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I said you guys weren't my friends.
I mean...
you guys just saved my life, and only true friends and hero dogs do that.
I just...
I just thought that if we weren't detective together, we wouldn't be together at all.
you guys are all I have.
it's just...being with you guys...
is the only time I don't feel like a weirdo.
I mean, I was just mad because you guys were making me grow up, and l...
I guess what I'm trying to say is...
I need to figure out myself before I figure out a mystery.
that's beautiful.
did you just make that up?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
it feels good.
Yeah, it does, right?
feels really good.
the coast is clear.
Hey, Juan.
Hey, Jim. I'm kind of in a hurry.
I don't want to hold you up, man.
I just want to give you a card.
if you ever want to get out of the lumber business game, that's me. I'll give you a leg up.
okay. Thanks.
I got to go, too.
old Frank's going to shit in the punch bowl as a goof.
Hey, dude, you tell Kelly your feelings for her.
promise. - I promise.
don't let life... Promise.
l... I promise.
okay. Drive safe.
okay.
all right, Frank. Ready? 1, 2, 3.
Hey, I'm sorry about what I said about Kelly when you guys were in the closet.
by the way, how was that?
I'm going to be honest.
I think we had sex.
help.
Kelly?
come to the lumber yard.
call the police, and she dies.
hello again.
how are you doing? - Hello.
the document.
what do we do?
maybe make him feel guilty.
then he'll let us go?
sure did kill a lot of people just to get your hands on a measly little document.
I didn't want anyone to die.
Leroy did that.
well, Leroy was acting under your orders, so...
I just wanted him to scare him.
peters found out the stuff was toxic.
he was going to go public and ruin the company and me.
more guilt.
Yeah, yeah, it's working, it's working.
Yeah, but you killed Leroy, too, so...
he kept asking for money. He knew too much.
what now?
negotiate.
okay. We'll make you a deal.
we'll give you the documents if you let us go, okay?
here are the documents.
now you have to let us go.
that's the rules. - Go, go, go, go, go.
those are the rules.
hands behind your head.
walk.
we had a deal.
he's going to kill us.
no, Kelly, he is not going to kill us, okay?
if he was going to kill us, he'd bring us to an enclosed space.
okay, well, I'm sure that Charlie can overpower him because he's the strongest...
okay, well, I'm sure Duncan's got some sort of fact that's going to get us out of this pickle, right, Duncan?
did you know that one out of every one Duncan Wheelers dies without ever kissing a girl?
okay.
no, I don't think he will be killing us, Kelly.
Jason.
because he's not a murderer.
what are you doing?
you're not going to kill a bunch of kids.
I thought you said we were grown-up detectives solving grown-up mysteries.
Hey.
shut up.
you're going to get us killed.
he's not going to kill us.
and you know why?
because deep, deep down, he is not a murderer.
he's a murderer!
he can do it!
deep, deep down!
whoa.
I'm punching you.
Hey, guys, I'm actually hitting him.
great gumballs.
it's almost 10.
the police will be here in a few minutes.
we'll be dead in a few minutes.
not if we...
I know it hurts, but you have to be quiet, okay?
no. It's not that. I sat on something.
it was in my pocket.
Duncan, do you still have your slingshot?
always.
what are you doing?
take this.
okay, I'm going to show you exactly where he is.
do not fire until you know exactly where he is, okay?
is this a firecracker?
we only get one shot.
Kelly.
he blew into my mouth.
okay, Jason. You can do this.
just shut off the power.
and don't get your face blowed off.
okay.
1...
2...
buckle my shoe.
3
Duncan, now!
Oh, fuck.
holy fudge, what a hit.
gee whiz.
I hope those were baby teeth.
what the hell?
someone stole that guy's face.
Jason?
no. Eyes open, okay? Eyes open. Come on.
Hey, let's play the awake game.
we love that game.
this really hurts.
Oh, fuck.
that's fun to say, right? It's fun?
Yeah. That's really fun. You were right.
okay, just keep your... Just keep talking, okay?
keep your eyes open.
Kelly, you're so neato.
I really like you.
Jim told me to say that.
I don't want to be like him.
he's pretty sad.
and Frank pooped in the punch bowl.
Jason.
we've got a code 1141.
we've got a gunshot victim at the lumber yard.
Hey.
Hey. Hey, man, wake the fuck up.
I was shot there, you jerk!
go whine like a little bitch.
I was shot, like, three times.
Whoa! Holy cannoli.
I want to be here for your first day, but I got to take care of something first.
take your time.
I've been caught so many times,
I know how it's done. I've got this.
she's all yours. Be good to her.
new Mystery Team, there's a mystery afoot.
Jessica Hellman's diary is missing.
I think Bobby Moss took it.
where that nigga live?
Hey, Dad, can I have the car keys?
don't forget about Brianna's recital tonight.
I won't. Bye, Mom.
Bye. - Bye, Brianna.
Bye, Jason.
sorry I'm just getting here.
you getting rid of this, too?
Yeah.
you're out of toilet paper, so I just toughed it out.
Hey, Jason. - Hey, Charlie.
how are Brianna and Kelly?
they're good, you know. Brianna's good.
my mom loves having a little girl, and Kelly's at Dartmouth, so I'll see her at Thanksgiving.
so it's kind of like dating your sister?
well, no. Brianna was adopted by my parents.
Kelly is technically an...
that's awesome.
so you and Kelly.
you guys...
come on, man. You can tell me what this means.
please?
no time, man. I got to get to my job, actually.
Oh, right. Medical technologies?
Yeah. They treat me pretty well.
they give me benefits, and it's part time, so I can take those private eye classes I've wanted to.
don't you need a degree for medical technologies?
you'd think so.
take care, okay?
I'll miss you.
all right. I'll call, okay?
well, countdown to your goodbye, right?
Yeah, U of M... University of Miami.
it's Michigan.
Michigan.
mom?
please! Help me! Help me!
what happened?
I don't know. He just came out of the woods.
please. Please. Help me.
I don't remember my name, and they took everything.
they took everything...except this.
I don't know what it means.
maybe it'll help.
maybe it will. Maybe it will.
I don't know.
mystery Team! All right!
they cut off my fucking balls!

I'm going to seduce rich women and get them to pay up.
you may go now.
boss! Just go.
thank you, boss.
one more thing, Min-jae.
I couId careIess if you become a phiIanderer or a pIayboy.
just don't teII anyone you worked for me.
it's a goddamn shame.
boss, you sure you shouId Iet him go Iike that?
he's a catch, but he's no thug materiaI.
the kid has too much heart.
sister dear...
love is eternaI.
imagine if there were no Iove in our Iives.
I just can't stand peopIe that try to buy Iove.
sister. -Yeah?
you beIieve in Iove, right?
Thanks. -What for?
you're right.
love is eternaI.
I must've Iost it.
my husband didn't hit me out of hate.
it was probabIy aII out of Iove.
and he probabIy stomped on me without knowing that it was me.
he probabIy knew.
thanks to you, I regained my rationaIity.
thank you so much.
no, you see... -Have a good Iife, honey.
sister.
it's way too Iate. I need to go fix him dinner.
wait, I didn't have dinner either.
fuck.
you're no good as a phiIanderer.
you shouId become a marriage counseIor.
shut up.
you need to stop that Iove buII shit.
just get straight to the point.
and Iook, if you're trying to pIay the game,
you don't want to be aII nice.
get to the point.
I got some good stuff. Wanna check it out?
thought I aImost had it this time.
it doesn't hurt to Iook. -Hey, Dong-shik.
I'm just trying to be a humane phiIanderer, you know.
I mean, being a phiIanderer is a service-centric profession.
but then we got aII these inhumane suckers, you know.
especiaIIy for you two, I'm wiIIing to offer you the best, and the most advanced, you know?
get out. -For aImost nothing.
I said, Ieave.
good day.
just watch. I'II get another chance.
sure. That's what dreams are for.
I'm teIIing you.
I'II find someone, hit it big, and Iive in styIe.
you'II see.
Hey, Dong-shik.
I'II show you how it's done today.
she's mine.
it'd be great if you couId heIp, but if not, I have a pIan.
just remember when you first came to our store.
if I bIurt it out, you know your oId man won't be happy.
we'II taIk over a drink.
what an honor to be getting a drink from Hae-mi.
that's for your medicaI biII.
if you're thinking the oId Hae-mi, think again.
I make a caII, you're dead.
keep caIIing if you want money for medicaI biIIs.
I can't pay you a penny other than medicaI expense.
you bitch! Since when did you turn aII arrogant and condescending.
you fuckin' whore!
who the heII are you?
fuck...
let's run, ma'am!
get him!
it shouId be safe here. This pIace is temporariIy cIosed.
you're aII wet.
ma'am, if it weren't for me today, you wouId've gotten in big troubIe.
Choi back there... he's known for beating women.
anyway, he must've reaIIy Ioved you, huh?
stupid bastard.
ma'am, Iove is eternaI.
imagine if there were no Iove in our Iives.
you beIieve in Iove, right?
ma'am!
weII... uhhh...
you!
aII you do is rip off women?
I don't rip off anything.
you said you wouId go hit it big in SeouI.
and aII you are is a phiIanderer?
what did you used to teII me?
wait, because you'II be back?
it's been five years since you Ieft.
Eun-ji. It's reaIIy you, huh?
wait a second. Is it reaIIy you?
was it that hard to make a caII?
no...
I never crossed your mind?
of course, I did.
I thought you were dead.
you know what, it wouId've been better if you were dead. What's this now?
weII... I thought of kiIIing myseIf.
but it's me we're taIking about. You know, Youn Min-jae. Remember?
I wanted to hit it big and Iive with you tiII death do us part.
has it reaIIy been five years?
one thing though, do you have to be that rude to me?
what's wrong, Eun-ji?
I'm Hae-mi. The Eun-ji you know died five years ago.
what? Eun-ji?
Hey, Eun-ji.
Eun-ji, you can't just Ieave Iike this.
let's taIk and catch up.
Hey, Eun-ji. Locked, huh?
Hey, roII down the window for a sec.
eun-ji! Come on, roII down the window!
I swear on this snow.
I'II be back in a year on a snowy day Iike today.
eun-ji! Don't worry. Just go home.
I'II come back Iooking good, so don't worry and go home.
Eun-ji, don't worry and just go, okay?
let me get another bottIe pIease.
that's enough.
I won't put it on the tab, don't worry.
sir, how about a shoe shine?
no thanks, I'm good.
come on, I'II shine them reaI good. Give it a try.
I said, no, thanks.
come on, you know you want it.
I got some good stuff here. Want to take a Iook?
I'II make it shine Iike a mirror. -It doesn't hurt to Iook.
you bastards. Don't you see I'm trying to get some reading done?
hoId on, who might this be?
do you know me?
I had dreams about you, and you don't remember me?
I think you're mistaken.
you're Gwang-paI from Kyungsang province aIright.
it's me. Wang Do-chuI from ChoIIa.
I'm not Gwang-paI.
Hey, Iow-Iife.
you ruined my Iife and you don't remember me?
you stinking bastard.
reIax, Do-chuI, wiII you?
it reaIIy wasn't my fauIt. I got the stuff aII for you.
I didn't know that it wouId have side-effects Iike that.
Do-chuI, I'm trying to move on with my Iife now.
I even have a wife with a baby inside.
so you were Iiving happiIy whiIe my famiIy was getting screwed.
no, man. I'm bareIy getting by.
you bastard!
do you know what happened to my dick after I took the piIIs you soId me?
it won't get hard and it's been sIeeping ever since.
it's sIeeping?
it won't get up. -ReaIIy?
no more erection. -None?
I turn impotent overnight.
my wife hits it off with this guy next door.
I'd have to kiII you to make up for what I've been through.
anyway, you're dead today.
come here!
Hey, drugs cause different reactions on different peopIe.
what?
don't come near me. I'm gonna run.
how fast do you run a hundred meters?
thirteen seconds.
I can do that in tweIve seconds fIat.
I ask for your mercy, man.
that's not happening.
fuck!
you stinking bastard!
CongratuIations, sir!
coionei, it's about time you find the right woman, sir.
your nephew's had enough hard work.
that's right. That's right.
teII him to come in.
is someone here?
they sent someone from the 32nd division.
isn't that the Samchung RevivaI Camp?
I guess he's in a hurry for reIocation.
captain Hwang from 32nd division, sir.
happy birthday, sir.
leave your gift there and Ieave.
Hey, where are you from?
what, sir?
where were you educated?
united Armed Forces academy, sir.
no wonder he's running errands with a captain rank.
I don't think where you come from is important as a soIdier.
how dare you... -Wait, wait...
then, what do you think is important?
it's one's patriotism for his country, sir.
that's respectabIe.
I shouId have someone Iike that under me.
since you came, have some dinner before you go.
this is no pIace for him to join.
no, no.
since you're here aIready, eat before you go.
wash your face with this.
there's a guest.
he said he was a hometown friend.
Eun-ji.
HoIy cow.
what brings you here?
you can go now.
this house is awesome.
what's this here?
are you crazy? Where do you think this is?
what? I'm just here to visit an oId friend.
what happened to you?
did you find a goId mine or something?
how did you find me?
it's not too hard.
how many peopIe in Korea do you think drive fancy cars Iike that?
Hey, Eun-ji, those are aII expensive stuff, huh?
are theses antiques?
Eun-ji, are these reaI goId? You found a goId mine, didn't you?
with just a few of these, you couId Iive in styIe.
you want them?
of course.
then take them.
ReaIIy? You sure I can take these?
as Iong as you don't get caught.
who's going to catch me?
don't you want to know who the owner is?
no.
it's someone that can easiIy kiII any one of us instantIy.
then don't teII him.
then take them.
I'm reaIIy taking them, okay? What the heII, why not?
fuck it. I'm not taking them.
if I take them and go into hiding, they'II never find me as you said.
but then, what's going to happen to you?
you said the guy can kiII any one of us, so that incIudes you too, right?
I'm okay, but you shouIdn't get hurt because of me.
you Iook reaIIy good. Look at where you're Iiving.
you have a sIick car and everything. Don't get in troubIe because of me.
you need to Iearn, girI.
anyway, this is some styIe we got here.
what brings you home at this hour?
I was nearby. Just wanted to get changed.
Ummm... the thing is...
take my cIothes first.
are you stiII smoking?
what did I teII you?
I said bad habits are better rid than done!
once you taste something new, you forget the vaIue of the oId.
don't go anywhere and stay home.
Eun-ji.
Eun-ji, Iook, you okay?
Eun-ji.
just go.
what's going on? TaIk to me.
just go.
Eun-ji, wake up. What's going on?
pIease go.
you're in danger, go.
Eun-ji.
I'm begging you. Just Ieave.
you can't stay here. Just go.
Eun-ji.
pIease.
come on, go. PIease go. You gotta go.
go.
Min-jae, go.
so you're home, huh?
remember me?
you know, the day you threw noodIe soup at me.
look at what you did.
how is it? Looks good, right?
why don't you try running again?
now that I know where you Iive.
couIdn't you forgive me?
you IittIe piss ass.
my dick's dead.
so now it's your turn.
you dog!
they caII me buIIdog.
dear...
stop right there!
stop, you fooI!
stop!
I said, stop.
stop.
get him!
Hey!
move!
sir, Iisten. PIease heIp.
what are you two?
excuse me.
I just need to get him. So just do as you were.
come here. -what?
I just have a personaI business with this guy to take care of.
come here!
crazy fucks.
I think your expression is a IittIe excessive.
don't you know where this bus is headed to?
this bus is going to the Samchung RevivaI Camp.
fine. Just take me anywhere, but here.
I don't care what camp it is, just take me.
RevivaI sounds good.
you bastard.
either you Iet the both of us go, or take both of us.
I'm not Ieaving this bus without him.
fuckin' asshoIes. KiII them!
do you Iike it?
you can never Ieave me unIess I dump you.
eun-ji!
are you crazy? What are you doing here?
foIIow me.
I'm sorry. OnIy if I hadn't showed up.
it hurt a Iot, right? What does he do anyway?
why do you have to Iive with a guy Iike that?
two years after you Ieft for SeouI, everyone in town Ieft because an army base was moving in.
that's when Butcher PaI-bong offered to find you for me in SeouI.
And?
the day we came to SeouI, PaI-bong soId me to a Geisha house and Ieft.
PaI-bong... fuckin' asshoIe...fuck.
it's aII my fauIt.
then I was introduced to this soIdier who said he couId find you.
he said he couId find you for sure.
I was stupid for beIieving him.
if I had known the shore was this cIose, I wouId've came aIready.
it's great here.
thank you god for finding Min-jae.
Eun-ji.
Hey.
eun-ji!
eun-ji!
eun-ji!
are you here for Hae-mi?
she's been shocked by a sudden externaI impact.
she needs to rest.
what now?
what about it?
isn't it pretty?
it doesn't sting?
for me.
I'II go with this one.
get him the butterfIy just Iike me.
ButterfIies aren't for men.
but it's something to remember me by when you go to SeouI.
Christ... WeII then.
this one's okay, I guess.
happy?
why do you have to cry Iike that? Okay, okay.
let me get the same one.
Min-jae.
they said you'II be okay if you get some rest.
I'm reaIIy not the oId Eun-ji.
I've changed a Iot.
that's okay, Eun-ji.
can you forgive me?
you didn't do anything wrong. There's nothing to forgive.
I'm the one that shouId be asking for forgiveness.
can you keep a promise?
don't go anywhere and Iet's run away together.
okay, okay. I won't ever Ieave you untiI death do us part.
you said you Iiked the sea, right?
we'II Iive in a pIace with a sea view.
I'm taIking about where we're going to Iive.
with huge paIm trees and a hammock, sipping freshIy squeezed juice.
that's right!
we'II put up a camp fire and cook up rabbit Iike before.
let's do that, okay?
let's Iive Iike that, Eun-ji.
sit.
Yes, sir.
why did you want to see me?
I want to become one of your men, coIoneI.
what did you say was the most important thing as a soIdier?
I said patriotism, sir.
then, where shouId you be showing your patriotism to?
my country, sir.
your country, huh?
let me ask that again.
where shouId you be showing your patriotism to?
you, sir.
Hey!
you're reaIIy giving me these cIothes, right?
Yes.
are you serious about Ieaving?
you don't need to know.
I'm going to go Iive in styIe with Eun-ji in a remote pIace.
live happiIy ever after, you son of a bitch.
I'm out.
see ya.
youn Min-jae. Take him.
what's wrong? What is it?
what the heII?
get off of me.
what are you doing?
let's go.
Hey, Dong-shik. What's wrong? Off of me.
Dong-shik, Dong-shik! What is this?
no, I'm not.
youn Min-jae. Odaesan crime famiIy member.
okay, okay. I'm one of them, are you happy now? Now Iet me go.
eun-ji's waiting for me.
I said Eun-ji's waiting for me, you son of a bitch!
Hey, Do-chuI, I guess this is it.
I feeI Iike I'm back in the army.
it can't be as bad as the army.
you never know.
I bet this pIace is way worse than the army.
as far as I know it couId be worse than the army.
look at their eyes, man.
did I ask you?
I'm just trying to be nice to you boys.
show some respect, wiII you?
who do you think you are? -what?
Hey, dip shits. Just shut the fuck up.
what are you on a picnic?
fuck.
you suckers.
you'II repeat what I say.
trainee ruIe of conduct Number one. I'II do as toId.
one, I'II do as toId!
two! I'II take aII beatings.
two, I'II take aII beatings!
three! I'II eat as served.
take off everything you're wearing except your skin and bone.
you have ten seconds. Execute!
Execute!
take off your watches, neckIaces, and rings.
Freeze!
Freeze! You wiII saIute the commander with 'AIIegiance'.
saIute Iike a man, and beIIow forth your 'AIIegiance'.
got that? -Yes, sir!
now onIy put on your pants. Execute!
saIute to the commander.
Aiiegiance!
Aiiegiance!
Aiiegiance!
at ease.
most of you were deIinquents in the reaI worId.
our society wiII no Ionger toIerate peopIe Iike you.
with regards to this, the army has decided to heIp you revive into a worthy human being.
the program wiII Iast for weeks with its focus on rebuiIding your body, spirit, and mind.
I'm Captain Hwang Gi-duk, your unit commander.
I hope you'II foIIow your instructors' Iead without troubIe.
saIute to the commander.
Aiiegiance!
Aiiegiance!
stay stiII!
can you pIease Ieave that?
shut up.
can't beIieve you're cutting it.
I said, shut up.
it hurts.
next.
you don't have anything to cut, asshoIe.
dreaming of Miss Yang from Daemyung aduIt barbershop.
shut up and get out.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
you're dead once we're out of here.
you think they'II Iet us out to eat?
how can you be fuckin' hungry right now?
you stupid bastard.
I'm coId and hungry, man. Shit.
patience, RefIection, Patience, RefIection,
patience, RefIection, Patience, RefIection,
who are you?
I'II expIain that to you Iater.
I have something to teII you.
you know Min-jae, right?
you know, Youn Min-jae.
that's right.
a bunch of soIdiers dragged him away that day and next thing I know, I get this notice in the maiI.
but you see, the Samchung RevivaI Camp is supposed to be way more than four weeks of revivaI training.
they say it couId take anywhere from six months to a year.
once you're in, they don't Iet you out safe can prepare about ten grand, he may be abIe to work something out.
you know, that's the money. For about a thousand, he said.
but I just can't afford for that money so I come here to...
get out.
if it's too much five is good.
I said, get out.
weII then maybe two grand?
get the fuck out!
want me to get out?
I shouId've gone with two grand from the start, shit.
man, I was too greedy.
is this a butterfIy?
that's a pretty sorry butterfIy.
stay stiII. Boss is trying to take in the art work.
go away.
go away? You fuckin'...
do you have a death wish?
you disgusting fIab of meat.
Hey, why wouId you wanna bother this scrawny kid?
get off, you fat fuck.
you okay?
you don't Iook Iike you beIong here.
what brought you here?
no way. You were a gangster? You?
how scary. What's your name?
youn Min-jae.
I'm Wang Do-chuI. Think of me as your big brother from now on.
as Iong as I'm here, you don't need to worry.
I got your back.
Hey, Iisten.
if any of you gets near my boy here, I won't Ieave you aIone.
you got that, or what?
what's wrong with those guys? Fuck.
come on, move.
wash what you can for the next one minute.
come on, hurry up now.
over there, sir.
how are you Captain Hwang?
sorry for intruding Iike this.
that's okay, Hae-mi. What brings you here?
my cousin's in the camp.
Oh, so he's a soIdier?
no, the poIice had some things mixed up and brought him here.
I was thinking maybe you couId heIp.
if it's your cousin wouIdn't it be a Iot easier if you ask the coIoneI.
weII, the thing is...
the Corp commander is paging you, sir.
Hey, I'm sorry. I need to be excused.
hoId on, wait.
what's his name?
Min-jae. Youn Min-jae.
he shouId be out safe in four weeks.
can I see him now?
I'm sorry. Visitings are prohibited.
but, Iet me see what I can do.
thank you. And one more thing...
I wouId appreciate it if you don't teII this to the coIoneI.
Yes, ma'am.
count, One!
two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine! Count over!
numbers one to three may go in and eat.
enter!
massive internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity, Gerald.
that's enough.
my young friend, you must have been in acute pain for many hours.
what kept you from seeking help, I wonder?
run the gut for me, would you, please, Gerald?
not a problem.
it's definitely a blockage.
it's strange, through. It seems to consist of a cluster of objects.
gallstones?
Oh, my, no.
gallstones that large could never pass through the cystic duct.
and even if they did, they wouldn't all be expelled at the same time.
although I did find a gallbladder once with almost a kilo of large stones.
of course, the victim was a sumo wrestler who weighed over 200 kilos.
he was in the middle of a bout. He just went
they're stones, doc.
not gallstones.
emeralds.
it was lodged in his gastrointestinal tract causing perforation of the peritoneum, internal bleeding, infection and death.
he swallowed emeralds. - He did, indeed.
I'm going to take a wild guess here, doc.
he smuggled them into the country.
it's from where he smuggled them in, Jethro.
our sailor just arrived from Guantanamo bay, cuba, where he was a translator.
petty officer second class Khalil sa'id, naturalized american citizen, born in Egypt.
worked as a translator at camp Delta, fluent in arabic, uyghur, pashtu.
died in his car on route 522 near Fredricksburg.
almost killed a pair of bikers.
I said bikers, Tony, not cyclists.
bikers is a term that refers to both cyclists...
next of kin? / None in the states. No U. S. Address, either.
and apparently he rotated from our naval station in Bahrain to Gitmo five months ago.
Where'd he get those emeralds?
Gitmo exchange?
sorry.
get your gear. We're going to Gitmo.
that's a good one, boss.
he was kidding, right?
I don't think so.
we're going to cuba! Ha-ha!
Hey, Gibbs.
I've got a gemologist coming over to look at the rocks.
he's my mother's friend's sister's son.
does he know his stuff? - I went out with him, like, once.
didn't get very far.
this all from the car?
Yeah.
it was a rental.
any classified material? - Not in the suitcases.
they could've swapped his hard drive before he left.
check it, anyway.
these were in the suitcase.
stamped, no postmark.
all the same return address.
NCIS special agent Paula Cassidy.
you know her? - No, but I will.
okay, smell this.
do those turn you on, Abby?
turned somebody on.
box of condoms, half empty.
the price tag says they'refrom the Gitmo exchange.
Hey, maybe it was a package deal.
see if you can brand the cologne.
why, you want some?
Nope, don't use cologne.
the women I date think the smell of sawdust is sexy.
that's why I don't date many women.
Oh!
sorry.
you had better have a good reason for spilling my coffee.
I do.
I booked us on the first AMC flight to Gitmo tomorrow.
Unbook it.
I knew it.
I told Kate you were pulling my leg.
the navy's giving us a priority ride today.
you mean it?
you do mean it.
normally, I hate priority rides, but who cares if it's going...?
what's wrong with priority rides? - Come on, boss.
tell me you like sitting on canvas seats slung between cargo pallets.
Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm back in the corps.
I love priority rides.
boss, this is the best.
I miss canvas seats.
check this out.
what do you want?
get to work. - I already started.
Guantanamo enjoys a year-round tropical climate, cooled by the breezes from the windward passage.
some of the more popular pastimes include skin diving, sunbathing and horseback riding.
I would be the last one to rain on your parade, Fidel, but you're logged onto an official navy web site.
it's PR.
this isn't.
it's the NCIS file on special agent Paula cassidy.
she's an interrogator at camp Delta.
special agent Cassidy is not to know that Sa'id is dead.
we're not working with her?
Sa'id was carrying five unmailed letters of hers.
until we find out how she was involved with him, she's out of the loop.
I can't believe we're in a $40-million gulfstream.
I mean, it's got to be CNO's or SECNAV's.
you know, Tiger woods has one of these.
Tom cruise, all the big movie stars. This is their ride.
Yeah, boss? - Can we get to work?
sure thing. Just...
check this out.
it's a gulfstream.
so much for the element of surprise.
welcome to Gitmo.
I'm special agent Paula Cassidy.
special agent Jethro Gibbs.
special agent Kate Todd, / Hi. how are you?
special agent Anthony Dinozzo Hey. / Hello.
I heard you all were coming.
nice ride.
you are so right there.
this is yours.
there's a map in it.
they've put you up in one of the nicest houses on the base.
we appreciate that, special agent Cassidy.
so is there something going down that I should know about?
no.
it's just that all my transcripts have been pulled, my interrogations have been canceled, and then you all arrive on a navy gulfstream.
how would you connect the dots?
I wouldn't.
okay.
enjoy your stay.
okay.
we'll set up here.
tomorrow morning, we'll be joined by the senior FBI translator, covering transcripts of Sa'id's translations.
the interrogator...
special agent Cassidy.
no way!
it's the only bedroom with a bath.
I know, and I picked it first.
women take baths, men take showers, Tony.
why does the woman thing come up when a ship is sinking or when there's only one bedroom with a bath?
Gibbs. / Well, you were right about Sa'id's laptop.
his system's a virgin.
well, we'll track down the hard drive he had here and ship it to you.
when is your rock boy coming?
in the morning.
my mother's very excited.
find anything else? - Yeah, I picked up another scent on his shorts and his T-shirts.
what did Sa'id do, bathe in the stuff?
no, it's not his.
it's peach and musk with vanilla as a top note.
it'd definitely feminine.
well, tag it.
perfume is expensive, Gibbs.
I can't just hang out at the macy's tester tray with my lab kit.
they frown on that sort of behavior.
buy what you need to, Abby. We'll deal with it later.
bold, Gibbs, bold.
we're finished. - And we need to talk to you.
whatever. It'll have to wait till the morning.
it's kind of important.
appreciate that.
I'm going to bed.
talk to you manana.
any preference on the remaining bedrooms?
no. They're both equally crappy.
you pick. - Ladies first.
night.
God!
Halt!
I need coffee.
Where'd you get this, Abby?
if I told you, I'd have to kill you, Benjamin.
this is very sweet, but you did not have to bring me a gift.
well, I wanted to.
and your mother said it was something you could use.
Oh, right on. Thanks.
Benjamin, this is great.
so, the emerald, is it real?
Oh, it's very real.
color grade 2. 5,
tone one to two, clarity I-one.
it's at least worth $20, 000.
and the color's quite distinct.
it's bluish-apple green.
and the fluid inclusions are quite different than colombian stones.
this emerald was mined in the Panshir valley.
Where's that?
afghanistan.
bill. Senior translator, camp Delta.
we've been expecting you. Special agent Gibbs, special agents Dinozzo and Todd.
when the FBI relaxes their dress code, they sure go for it.
these are the transcripts of the interrogations of Nasser al jazair you requested.
the translator was Sa'id?
that's right. Apparently there's a problem?
did you know him? - Only to say hello.
he worked with your interrogator, Paula cassidy.
you might want to think about keeping that door shut.
iguanas have been known to wander inside.
Nasser arrived in june from Afghanistan.
Yes. Insists he was picked up by mistake.
ha. weren't they all.
agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject.
younger detainees feel more comfortable with female interrogators.
once rapport's been established, prisoner is only interrogated by that team.
I understand agent Cassidy's not in the loop on this?
correct.
I booked you an interrogation room for this afternoon.
we'd better get started.
okay, I want to know more about agent Cassidy.
who her friends are in Gitmo. How she spends her free time.
where she hangs out.
is she involved with Sa'id.
sure. / No problem.
did I say both of you?
well, you didn't not say both of us, Gibbs.
Yes, she's kind of got a point there, boss.
well, I'm saying it now.
DiNozzo, you go.
Kate will stay here and help me with this.
got it.
do you mind telling me why he...? - Yeah.
agent Cassidy has a lot of friends, I'll say that.
mostly male friends, and mostly either interrogators or translators.
Where's she hang?
club on base called El floridita.
check it out.
observe her if she's there.
can I drink? / Sure.
sasparilla? - Who drinks sasparilla?
who's shane?
who's Alan ladd? - Maybe you should check her out, Kate.
I'm on it.
Where's agent dinozzo?
drinking sasparilla.
they'll bring Nasser down as soon as the evening prayers are finished.
why aren't you praying?
I'm presbyterian.
how do you say good cop, bad cop in arabic?
I learned my arabic at the defense language institute in monterey.
that phrase wasn't in the syllabus.
Nasser should be here in about five minutes.
watch his body language.
fortunately, Nasser speaks some english.
so, Jack palance shoots Elisha cook.
the slug lifts his body off the ground, and splat, right into the mud.
you ever seen the maltese falcon?
Nope. / Oh, you young people don't know what good movies are.
all this violence today, so sad.
splat isn't violent?
what are you drinking?
root beer.
so you're on duty? - Maybe I just like sarsaparilla.
Cosmo, Jimmy.
coming up.
that's funny. I knew you were going to order a cosmo.
are you here to check me out?
define checking out.
come on, what are you doing here?
straight up?
no, I.I want you to lie to me.
you turn me on.
here, let me pay. - No, thanks.
I buy my own drinks.
so, Jack palance shoots Elijah wood?
he asks who we are.
name is Gibbs.
u. S. Naval criminal investigative service.
sit down.
where is Paula?
she's been replaced...by me.
Why?
I think you know why.
no.
well, sit down, Nasser. I'll tell you why.
Sa'id is dead.
he's praying.
thank you.
miss me?
like herpes.
that confuses me.
Really? / Absolutely.
if you don't like me, then why do you keep coming over here for refills?
I like the game.
me, too.
your move.
you've been here eight months, and you haven't hooked up.
well, how do you know?
you danced with five different guys. Nothing going on with any of them.
you're counting the men that I'm dancing with?
I'm the jealous type.
huh. Jimmy, does he seem like the jealous type?
I thought so...
see? / Till he flashed his badge when I wouldn't answer any questions about you.
more info than she needed, Jimmy.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
what if I told you I was checking out the competition?
I'd say you were lying. - No, it's true.
I'm checking out the competition.
for your investigation.
and for me.
so, what are you going to write in your report?
that you have rules about hooking up with men you work with.
accurate?
incomplete.
I have rules about guys that investigate me, too.
never broken a rule?
have you?
if the risk is worth it.
Jimmy, un tequila y una cerveza, por favor.
Si, senor.
let's dance.
Sa'id was a good man.
he gave me hope I would see my family again.
he said america does not hate islam...
that Allah knows we are here.
don't you want to know how he died?
or have you guessed? - He guessed.
how would I know?
we have no contact here with the outside world.
he swallowed these.
they killed him.
think he got them from you.
I don't understand.
says he's never seem them before.
he'd like to return to his cell, so he can pray for his friend's soul.
tell him he's not going back to his cell.
he's being transferred to isolation.
he says he was promised a transfer to minimum security.
who promised him that?
special agent Cassidy.
one second.
back at the house...
be there in five.
I'm back on duty.
well, that's too bad.
so are you.
why'd you recommend transferring Nasser to minimum security?
reward for cooperation.
that's the idea around here. - We read the transcripts.
he didn't tell us anything we didn't know.
well, that's not the point. He told us all that he knows.
are you sure?
it's a judgment call, but we get a lot of flack around here for holding people too long.
are you going to tell me what's going on?
are you going to tell us what was going on between you and Sa'id?
we worked together.
that's all.
these were found in Sa'id's luggage.
well, he was going to put them in the mail for me.
couldn't find the post office?
mail is slow out of Gitmo.
Sa'id was on his way to the states, and I asked him to throw them in the mail for me.
you mind of we open them? - Yes, I mind.
they're private. - We'll get a court order.
what the hell is this about?
why do you have these letters?
something happen to Sa'id?
he's dead.
Oh, my god.
how? what happened?
tell me how he died.
internal bleeding from a perforated bowel caused by the presence of hard objects in his intestines. / Hard objects, what the hell is that supposed to mean?
look...
I have been a damn good NCIS agent for over six years now.
I really don't deserve to be treated like this.
all we asked is, can we open these letters?
sure, go ahead. Open the damn things.
thank you.
they're to my family. Would you like to...
search my apartment while you're at it? / I will.
okay.
sorry, Paula.
check out Sa'id's apartment, too.
first time I've seen you apologize to a suspect.
how would you feel if I was going to search your apartment?
violated beyond belief.
you know why you're attracted to her, though, don't you? / Who said I was?
it's endorphins. - Well, thank you, Abby.
Oh, you were so excited about going to cuba and riding in the jet.
it stimulated the hell out of your endorphins.
the first woman you saw was like honey to a bear.
you were the first woman I saw on my endorphin high.
Yeah, well, we work together, Tony. It's like a brother-sister thing.
never had a sister.
that's probably a good thing. - You just passed Sa'id's room, sis.
need some help?
no.
Tony, wait.
Sa'id had a key to her apartment.
well, she doesn't have a key to his.
women like making love in their own bed.
now, wait a minute, just 'cause you're a woman and you enjoy doing it in your own bed. / you're right, I misspoke.
does not mean that all women - I was wrong, Tony.
I insist on doing it in their own bed. - Let it go.
going to read me my rights?
you have the right to be reimbursed for postage.
put it on your expense report.
Thanks.
you might want to take that chip off your shoulder.
gladly.
just treat me as a member of the team.
we're in the same agency, not on the same team.
is this interrogation over?
Yeah. Yeah, almost. Uh...
why is special agent Dinozzo sorry?
he blew his chance to get laid.
this just came for you from Guantanamo bay.
it's Sa'id's hard drive.
excellent.
Ah...
quite a collection.
Yeah, I'm trying to match a scent I found on Sa'id's clothes.
I don't see chanel number five.
does anyone wear that anymore?
my mother does.
Really?
ever since Marilyn monroe confessed that chanel number five was all she wore to bed.
so, does your mother...?
unfortunately, yes.
makes for terribly awkward slumber parties.
Nasser is extremely upset.
feels he's been cooperative and now he's in a cell with no windows.
well, maybe after losing all this luxury, he'll be even more cooperative.
a psychiatrist examined him and is worried for his mental health.
I'm not all that interested in the mental health of people who want to kill me.
you certain Nasser's a terrorist?
isn't it possible he is what he says he is.
a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
Yeah, and it's also possible that he's the man who gave Sa'id those emeralds.
why would he do that?
are you that naive?
or did Nasser pass some of those emeralds on to you?
what are all these bottles, Abby?
that's the perfume you said I could buy.
did we have to buy so many?
I only got 30.
there's more than 2, 500 on the market.
you're kidding me.
perfume is the most powerful accessory a woman can wear.
Yeah, well, how much did all this power cost us?
around $1, 500.
$1, 500?
well, that's not including the tax.
I stuck to the 30 most popular scents, hoping we'd get lucky.
Ah...
thank you. / So, we get any bang for our 1, 500 bucks?
we did.
the perfume on Sa'id's clothes is called escada.
never heard of it.
you wanna hear about his hard drive?
what's it going to cost me?
it's pretty much synonymous with his sex drive.
our boy deleted 20 gigs of porn before he turned his drive in.
he was trading with a porn pal on a hotmail account that doesn't exist anymore.
anything good on it?
nothing with sawdust yet.
agent Cassidy's?
Yeah. Uh...
nothing else of interest in her apartment, except...
what?
she had a bottle of escada on her dresser, and Sa'id had a key to her apartment, but she did not have a key to his.
most women prefer their own beds.
so, she and Sa'id were doing the horizontal salsa.
not according to the bartender at El floridita.
what, lovers register with him at Gitmo first?
bartenders know this kind of stuff, boss.
he said she went there most nights, danced with a lot of guys, but...
always went home alone.
What'd you find out, Kate?
Sa'id's place wasn't just clean, it was sterilized.
there were some towels, soap and a half a roll of toilet paper.
I think Sa'id copied Paula's key without her knowing it.
now, which brain is thinking that, Dinozzo?
I'm hitting the rack.
get this off to Abby first thing in the morning.
you know, Gibbs, - sometimes you can be a real... - bastard?
Yes.
Yeah, well, my gut is telling me agent Cassidy's telling the truth.
so, then, what's the problem?
romance between agents, Kate...
it never works.
you speaking from experience?
Sa'id and I were not lovers.
who told you that?
room key.
had yours on his key chain.
that's not possible.
how would he get my room key?
you gave it to him.
no, I didn't.
I lost a key.
had to replace one.
Sa'id could've stolen it.
are you just remembering now that you lost a key?
I was just told that somebody else had it.
okay.
okay, let's say that I buy that.
why would he want a key to your room?
to get to my computer.
but how does he get my password?
if you don't keep your doors shut, the iguanas get in.
we did so many interrogations together...
he could've watched me type it in.
why would Sa'id want to get into your computer?
to read my interrogation reports.
I don't know.
lately, I noticed that his conversations with Nasser seemed longer than his translations.
I even noted that in my computer.
Sa'id... took leave and left the next day for the states, right after I wrote that.
his room was empty. He wasn't intending to come back.
I should've had bill come and sit in on one of the interrogations and check my suspicions.
I blew it.
these are the hard objects that Sa'id had in his stomach when he died.
emeralds?
I think he got them from Nasser.
but how did Nasser get them past our body search?
Nasser complained of constipation when he arrived, and they gave him a laxative.
he got them in the same way Sa'id got them out.
what are you looking at, Abby?
it's just sex, Ducky.
just sex?
Yeah.
you know, biological act between creatures within a species in response to neurological and physiological stimuli.
between creatures within their species?
usually.
this isn't yours, I hope.
no.
it's off Sa'id's hard drive.
but something's wrong.
the files are too big.
not just the files.
Easter eggs.
what the hell are easter eggs?
Easter eggs are hidden messages within a computer program.
if you don't know to look, you don't know they're there.
they were hidden in the porn?
my cursor has moved across places that would make Tony blush.
what kind of messages?
there's a diagram of the camp, and a bunch of stuff in arabic.
it's coming to you now.
something tells me it's not a greeting from the bunny.
Sa'id arrived Gitmo april 23.
april 28, he writes,
son-in-law located.
may 11,
son-in-law moved to minimum security.
may 23, he gets a response.
leader disavows son-in-law.
he will be eliminated by the one who is victorious.
leader?
my god, we've got one of Bin laden's son-in-laws here and didn't know it.
the one who is victorious?
why does he start talking in riddles all of a sudden?
I don't think he is.
I may not be translating that accurately.
it's old arabic for the one who is victorious.
I, uh, owe you an apology, Gibbs.
if I transferred Nasser into minimum security...
you didn't. Don't worry about it.
how do we find this son-in-law?
easy.
we transfer Nasser to minimum security so he can kill him.
in camp Delta, the security buck stops with me.
if Nasser kills a detainee, it'll be my ass.
yeah...
but once the son-in-law learns that Bin laden ordered him murdered, he's going to sing like a bird in islamic paradise, and maybe that prevents another 9/11.
what's your plan, Gibbs?
we transfer Nasser to minimum security.
from isolation to minimum security? He's bound to be suspicious.
new interrogator'll have to deliver the news convincingly.
since we know he trusts women, that's me.
no, that's me.
I'm the one he trusts.
you promised him minimum security. He got isolation.
he won't believe you have the authority to move him.
he will when I order the guards to remove the shackles.
that's too risky. - Tony's right.
Nasser and Sa'id did this right in front of me.
you're an interrogator, not a translator.
you couldn't have known.
but I did.
I had suspicions about Sa'id, and I let them slide.
it's inexcusable.
Yep.
let me make up for it.
how good an actress are you, agent Cassidy?
ask Tony.
he bought my act.
icing me was an act?
no.
letting you think I was melting was.
Tony, she'd say anything to get in that room.
Kate, it's not a problem. We were both playing a game.
yeah...
who won?
Hello, Nasser.
I did not expect we'd meet again.
neither did I.
remove the shackles.
now, please.
where is Gibbs?
recalled to washington.
his superiors determined that his concerns were unfounded.
he's not buying it.
he will.
agent Gibbs has had problems in the past.
agent Cassidy, this isn't appropriate.
he deserves to know.
he has a history of building cases at the expense of the facts.
tell him.
she's good.
I was locked up like a dog.
it was out of my hands, Nasser. I'm sorry.
I've arranged to have you returned to your cell.
just answer one question.
do you have a conscience?
I have a moral awareness of my actions.
good.
because I've trusted you, Nasser.
I'm glad you are back.
so am I.
she's ending the session. What is she doing?
playing him.
he's asking about the transfer to minimum security you promised him.
I'll try.
we have 120 detainees in minimum security at present.
20 to a unit.
barracks 20 is the one Nasser is assigned to, and this...
that's the inside surveillance cam.
how many guards do you have inside the barracks?
two. One on each exit, front and rear.
odds are six-to-one against his target being billeted in the same barracks as him.
that means Nasser is going to have to kill his target in the exercise yard.
what does secret service think?
three sharp shooters, there, there, and one in the watchtower.
I have an idea.
it's about time.
Nasser has to change his jumpsuit - when he transfers, right? - Spanking brand-new white one, so?
so I want to add a little trim.
you're being transferred to minimum security, Nasser.
you have kept your word.
does that surprise you?
no.
don't betray my trust, Nasser.
I will not.
right there. they're bringing him out now.
talk about your own personal web-cam.
we only did enough of the search to keep it legitimate.
you think he already has a weapon?
Oh, yeah, I do. Probably a shive.
it makes sense. Easy to conceal.
how does he make a shiv in max security?
a comb, a toothbrush, something innocuous ground to a point.
you're good.
bet you could've made it in hollywood.
I don't know if I'm hoping you're right or wrong about Nasser.
he's a killer.
it's in his eyes. / Yeah...
the eyes always give you away.
Oh, yeah.
your target is the fifth detainee to exit.
acknowledge when you have him in your sights.
Roger that.
okay, I've got him.
that's a diversion.
lost target. Repeat, no shot.
My.my sniper's lost his target.
he's heading in the opposite direction. He switched groups.
he's going into barracks 21.
he's made his man.
where are your guards, colonel?
NCIS, open it up!
DiNozzo, go around back!
got it!
go!
get down!
I'd have killed him.
and make him a martyr?
no.
this is worse than death.
she looks awfully lonely back there.
so?
so... I think one of us should go and keep her company.
Why?
she is one of us.
what?
well, I can't let her ride alone.
why is it that women always want to fix what doesn't need fixing?
makes us feel all warm inside.
so does scotch, but it doesn't cost you a house.
I didn't really think... - I didn't think that...
you go.
watch this.
it's a gulfstream.
how did you know I had a date last night?
Yeah, you talked for 11 on the phone, Its meaning just says something.
you mean you eavesdropped.
Yes, it didn't go too well, huh?
he had to cancel.
what excuse did he give?
surgery.
it's a good one.
I'll remember that.
what was wrong with him? - He didn't have surgery, Tony.
he performed it.
Hey! How was your big date last night?
What'd I say? - Date never happened.
what excuse did he give?
surgery.
that's a good one!
grab your stuff.
Where're we going? - West virginia.
almost heaven.
take me home, country road.
a little John denver.
let me grab my gear.
Clarksburg.
what's in Clarksburg?
junk dealer stumbled onto a leg.
we're driving to West virginia to look at a leg?
it belongs to a marine.
how can you tell from a leg?
how do? - This how you found the leg?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Green found it in that dumpster.
when he realized what he was holding, he tossed it to get rid of it.
landed here.
kind of funny.
what? - How it landed.
like it was climbing the stairs.
you think finding the severed leg of a marine is funny?
no, sir. No, sir, I don't.
find the rest of the body?
not yet.
local chief of police has his boys checking all the dumpsters and the town garbage pit.
well, I'll leave you all to it.
Tony, laser and sketch. / Got it.
Kate, take photos. / Yeah.
so, what do we got here, Duck, other than the obvious?
well, with the absence of hemorrhagic tissue around the point of injury,
I'd say the limb was severed postmortem.
time of death?
from a leg?
I'll tell you what, Gibbs.
you find me a liver in that leg, and I'll estimate you a time of death.
what's that, wedged in the sole?
from a small seed, a mighty trunk may grow.
well, there's not much more for me to do here.
I saw a great antique store around the corner.
give me a shout if you need me.
need you here.
Oh, Jethro, I refuse to speculate on the time of death of the marine missing that leg.
however, I will tell you that the limb, itself, has been dead more than, no less than 24 hours.
I'll shout if I need you.
you find the boot?
I was just looking for junk, stuff people throw out.
like a boot? / Yep.
no law against taking stufffolks thrown out.
why you putting on rubber gloves?
we're going to need your prints. / For what?
separate them from those we find on the leg.
you can take fingerprints off a leg?
I don't get the whole tattoo thing.
I'll add that to the ever-growing list of things you don't get.
being stuck with a needle thousands of times for a piece of artwork...
no, thank you.
it's more than just artwork, Tony.
on a woman, maybe.
what? - You know, on a woman.
it means she's up for anything.
Abby's got tattoos.
no comment. - Oh, what about me?
you think I'm up for anything?
you don't have a tat. - And if I did, then that would just blow your theory to hell, now wouldn't it?
okay, say for a minute I believe you got one.
where is it?
nowhere you will ever see.
Ah, necessity, the mother of invention.
I suspect the inventors of super glue never imagined that, when heated up and applied to surfaces in gaseous form, its bonding capabilities would enable us to obtain fingerprints from a human leg.
I liked that commercial where the guy put super glue on his hard hat and then glued his head to the beam and hung there.
I tried that with my little brother.
I sense this anecdote doesn't have a storybook ending.
it does if you like your stories to end with bald seven year olds.
he still gets mad when I call him Kojak.
so I pulled a partial off her leg that isn't the junk collector's.
could be the victim's.
run it through the military database.
so any other body parts show up?
no.
isn't that a little bit hinky? - Oh, it's more than a bit.
all we've got is a tattooed leg, a sock and a boot.
you're forgetting about our interesting little bit of botanical evidence.
Oh, yeah. That. Yeah.
well, I want the life history, family, where it grew up...
college transcripts, I know.
Yeah.
our victim had a titanium ankle joint, which I'm about to remove.
that's too young for arthritis.
Yeah, it was most likely due to an accident, auto, motorcycle, skiing.
polo.
polo's a very dangerous sport. / Yes, the joint will have a serial number traceable to the doctor who performed the surgery.
anything else? - Well, as I suspected, our marine was dismembered postmortem.
here. The jagged teeth pattern on the femur bone suggests that a saw was used.
well, he didn't feel it, Tony.
still makes me wince. - Yes, well, given how straight and clean the cut was, it was almost certainly some kind of power saw.
I wonder if they still have the Eurail pass.
Yeah. In the summer of my 18th year, my grandfather gave me a Eurail pass to celebrate my advancement to university.
I traveled to nine different countries.
met an Austrian girl named Giselle who left her fingerprints on my heart.
visited all the major museums of Europe.
the artwork was extraordinary.
Ah, Da vinci, Rembrandt,
van gogh, Renoir...
Botticelli... - I like saying Botticelli.
and that brings me to Christy brown, the irish poet and painter.
Yes, he suffered from cerebral palsy.
learned to paint with his foot.
quite remarkable.
he wrote an autobiography, "My left foot," which became an exceptional film starring Daniel day lewis.
that's a right foot.
Oh. So it is.
Ah, well.
serial number of the ankle joint is three-two-seven four-zero-one-five.
I'll hold.
doing something case-related?
joint replacement database site, targeting orthopedic specialists, search referenced to hospital privileges and surgical records.
all right, Dinozzo.
is it on your butt?
I told you, I was kidding.
you only said you were kidding because you were embarrassed you told me.
I don't have a tattoo. - It's a butterfly, isn't it?
you seem like a butterfly kind of girl.
Yeah, it's a butterfly.
on my hip.
Oh, yes, I'm still here.
thank you.
the manufacturer shipped our marine's titanium ankle to the naval hospital in Bethesda in '99.
it was signed for by captain Brent peters. May 14, 2000.
I'll call Gibbs.
it's not a butterfly, is it?
I remember that surgery.
we usually fuse the ankle and implant a metal splint in our young servicemen.
but his ankle was literally crushed in an auto wreck.
may of 2000, you said?
according to our research.
here it is. May 15, 2000.
I implanted that ankle in marine private first class Thomas dorn.
what can you tell me about him?
I can tell you a lot about his ankle. I don't even remember the rest of him.
seems to be a recurring problem.
the ankle? - No, the rest of him.
his leg was found in a Clarksburg, West virginia trash bin early this morning.
just the leg?
so far.
how deteriorated was the leg?
it wasn't.
the M. E. estimated he died within the previous 24 hours.
there a problem?
according to his military record...
PFC Dorn died two years ago.
PFC Don's service record.
he was only in the corps 11 months before the accident.
he was about to get a medical discharge when he died.
got the death certificate.
signed by a Dr. Sylvia chalmers in Harmony, West virginia.
Yeah, population 1, 600.
sounds cute, doesn't it?
cause of death, myocardial infarction.
a heart attack at 22?
as Abby would say, pretty hinky.
I do believe the die is cast, however.
if your parents and grandparents live to be old, so will you.
I had an aunt who died at seven.
just a theory.
Where's the autopsy report?
there isn't one. - You mean you didn't find it.
no, I mean no autopsy.
the doctor signed a death certificate, but that was it.
small towns, you can get away with murder.
the hell you can.
you find the doctor in Harmony, why there was no autopsy report.
find out where this body is buried.
you get a court order to dig up PFC Dorn, and you have that body shipped back here to Ducky.
find anything?
nothing yet.
I'll tell you one thing, though. This guy had huge feet.
I could wear this sock as a leg warmer.
what are you implying, Abby?
I'm not implying anything.
but you know what they say about guys with big hands and big feet, right?
what?
they're clowns.
I got something.
what are you so happy about?
I'm just looking forward to Harmony.
you really like small towns?
peace and quiet?
a place where people know you by name?
no blockbuster or starbucks on every corner. What's not to like?
it's too quiet. Everybody knows your name.
there're no blockbusters or starbucks on every corner.
you know, big cities just can't give you what small towns can, Tony.
it's a simpler way of life, a slice of americana.
Oh, one that doesn't include 50 yard line seats to the redskins or women with full sets of teeth. / Yeah, always comes back to that, doesn't it?
see? You do get me.
Hey, Gibbs?
I ran the partial we pulled off the leg through the military database.
yeah? / No match.
but I did find a piece of straw on the sock.
what kind?
the hay kind.
just your regular basic straw.
sorry.
Thanks, Abs.
this is just how I pictured it.
this is just how I pictured it.
can I help you?
I'm sure you can.
I'm special agent Anthony dinozzo.
you can call me Tony.
we'd like to talk to Dr. Chalmers, uh...
okay.
why don't you just give her a breast exam?
in good time.
our seed matured and fell in late fall.
it comes from a monoecious yellow flower.
not too showy.
the male and female appearing in March to April in separate spherical heads.
the leaf is palmately veined. It's four to eight inches wide, ovate in shape, and has three to five lobes.
Abby, are we ever going to get to the tree?
or more commonly known as....a sycamore tree.
I'm afraid so.
pretty much grow everywhere, don't they?
Yep.
it was a tragedy.
he was such a nice looking young marine.
had you met him before? - No, no, he didn't live around here.
he just walked in?
well, I was the only doctor for 40 miles at the time.
Dr. Burger on the sign, is he a new addition?
he's buying out my practice.
I still see some of the older patients who don't trust a young doctor.
he's only 37.
and who brought PFC Dorn into your office?
I believe he just walked in.
Thelma could have told you.
Thelma bowman, my nurse.
she died last summer. Stroke.
we were together, doctor and nurse, for nearly 30 years.
I'm sorry.
so am I.
you saw that young thing Dr. Burger hired to replace her?
sure did.
I'm sorry. Go on.
well, uh, Thelma brought this young marine into my office.
sat him right down there in that chair.
he couldn't catch his breath.
he was suffering extreme chest pains.
classic heart attack symptoms.
why didn't Thelma just take him to an examination room?
well, we only have one.
and, uh, let's see, I think the Thomas twins was in there with the measles.
well, anyway, before I could get up from this chair, he'd collapsed.
right where you're standing now.
and I administered CPR, while Thelma called county looking for the ambulance.
only, it was over at a car accident way out in Turtle creek.
the county only has one ambulance?
you've never lived in a small county, have you, son?
fortunately, no.
well, it has its compensations.
anyway by the time the ambulance got here, young Dorn had expired.
and why didn't the coroner do an autopsy?
well, I...
I didn't feel there was a need to.
you're the coroner?
I was.
it's pro bono work.
Dr. Burger's coroner now.
I did do a blood test and found elevated levels of cardiac enzymes.
that and his symptoms seemed sufficient.
not anymore.
we're getting a court order to exhume the body.
Oh, my. I'm afraid that's going to be impossible.
you had it cremated?
no, I didn't.
his sister did.
she was so upset when she identified the body.
she didn't have the money to ship him home, she wanted to scatter his ashes over the Blue ridge mountain.
I told her I really should do an autopsy.
but she was so distraught over the, the thought of him being cut up.
you let her talk you out of it?
I've known the pain of loss.
I'm afraid I let hers affect me more than it should have, professionally.
that had never happened to me in all my years as a doctor.
that was when I decided it was time to retire and sell my practice.
you recognize this marine?
no, I don't.
Why? Should I?
it's PFC Thomas dorn.
what are you thinking?
the perfume?
she was wearing it.
older ladies seem to like it.
had an ex-girlfriend who used it.
is that why she's an ex-girlfriend?
exactly.
how does a sister misidentify her brother?
she doesn't.
we going to have to report the autopsy screw-up?
do I detect a soft heart thing happening here?
that's it, isn't it?
the tattoo's a heart.
we're back on that again.
I just can't imagine you getting a tatto, that's all.
I was drunk. - I can't imagine you're drunk either.
so...
it is not heart.
it's a rose on my butt.
can we move on now?
sure.
so we are done with this then.
we are done.
Kate, which cheek is it on?
what killed him?
digitalis.
the heart medication?
Yep.
the tox level in Dorn's leg, alone, was enough to kill a bull.
would an overdose give symptoms of a heart attack?
not just the symptoms.
Oh, okay!
so, you think our leg and that marine that died two years ago of a heart attack are tied together?
I do not believe in coincidences.
what about that rock formation on the moon that looks like Jay leno's chin?
it's perfectly normal.
on a race track, maybe.
women will never understand taking a little car ride and trying to beat your best time.
I hate it when men do that.
see, this is a woman thing.
how'd you do?
pretty good.
I beat my time by four minutes, including construction detours.
in Harmony.
Oh, uh...
doc Chalmers is a very sweet little old lady who, um, unfortunately also happens to be the local coroner.
small town, boss.
small town.
a woman claiming to be Dorn's sister I. D.ed the body and then conned her into skipping the autopsy and cremating the body.
cremation. It's a dead end.
what?
this woman must be some sweet talker.
well, it's more Dr. Chalmers is a very connable little old lady.
probably gets her roof shingled and her driveway tarred every year.
does Dorn even have a sister?
his military file indicates his only living relative is a half-sister, Melissa dorn.
put a trace on her?
well, I did the best I can balancing my laptop while pulling five girlfriends turns.
that's an exaggeration, boss.
I mean, maybe three g's, once.
keys.
what? I can't drive because Kate's chicken?
I'm not a chicken.
you can't drive because you're not going.
Oh. That's different.
why aren't I going?
because you're going to be doing a background check on Melissa dorn.
Kate, you coming?
ABS, do you know where Kate has her tat?
Yep.
watch her body language.
what are we looking for, short of a confession?
sometimes it's not what they say.
it's what they don't say.
which translates into, "we don't have a search warrant, and this is the easiest way in.
what's wrong?
you know what kind of tree this is?
botany was my weakest subject.
sycamore.
Hi. Can I help you?
you already have.
you would've liked Tommy.
he was the life of the party.
he was your half-brother.
Yeah.
we were raised by our father.
do you have any brothers and sisters?
no. / An only child.
I figured as much.
how so? / You have all the classic traits of a first-born.
confident, pays attention to detail, perfectionist... difficulty sharing.
guilty, guilty, guilty.
depends.
so why the visit after two years?
we're working on another case.
um, there might be a tenuous connection.
well, how can I help?
do you have any of your brother's personal effects?
it, uh, would've made me sad.
Oh, where are my manners?
would you like some coffee?
Oh, yeah, I'd love some coffee.
none for me, thanks.
this may be the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen.
well, that's because it's never been used.
not the domestic type, huh?
no.
I eat over the sink so I don't have plates to wash.
you even have plates?
paper.
this is a big house for one person.
and two cats.
do you like cats?
they don't much like me.
how can you tell? - By the way they look at me.
I hate to break it to you but cats only have one expression.
thank you.
you should actually try it before you thank me.
Yeah, it's perfect. Thank you.
Really?
you're right.
I like your tattoo.
it means... / Peace, health, prosperity.
you know chinese.
any other hidden talents I should know about?
I can sample the frosting on a cake without leaving a fingerprint.
Wow.
this is, um...gonna sound terrible, but...
I hope whatever you're investigating is...is tied to Tom.
Why?
then I wouldn't need to make up an excuse to see you.
you weren't buying any of that, were you?
any of what?
you know.
her charm.
is it really that hard to believe, Kate, that I might be attractive to a woman?
that's not what I meant.
you find us anything to get us a search warrant?
well, she told you that she lives alone, but the toilet seat was up in the downstairs bathroom.
Oh.
you can tell that one to the judge.
okay, Abby found a piece of straw in Dorn's sock, and there is a barn around the back.
okay. I found nothing to give us probable cause.
maybe I did.
question.
can you match DNA from trees like you can with humans?
Absolutely.
plant DNA, like human DNA, is unique to each plant, so you can distinguish one sycamore tree from another.
okay.
try matching these...to the seed we found in Dorn's boot.
is the other sample from another location?
no. Same tree.
so you want me to run the test twice?
Yeah.
okay, how long before you have something on both samples?
depends on whether or not you want it fast or you want it right.
both.
both.
we need four...carry the seven, divided by...
six hours.
clock's ticking, Abs.
six-letter word for a reason to commit a crime?
come on, don't tense up.
starts with "M.
murder. / No.
motive.
murder is a motive.
what do you have?
a six-letter word for a reason to commit a crime.
that's seven letters.
works for me.
what have you got?
PFC Dorn...
purchased a term policy for three quarters of a million two months before his heart attack in Harmony.
the beneficiary is his only living relative.
his half-sister Melissa.
she and Dorn fed some sucker digitalis and dropped him off in Harmony.
harmony, a small, crappy town where she identifies the sucker as her brother, cons the old lady coroner with crocodile tears into cremating the body and not performing an autopsy.
the insurance company paid the claim?
sure did.
get the name of the adjuster?
stanley borden. Rexford mutual, Baltimore.
why are you two still here?
come on, Kate, you're only going ten miles over the limit.
and that's pushing it.
what good is it being an armed federal agent if you can't drive fast?
you get to shoot bad guys.
true.
you should have seen Gibbs with Melissa.
he threaten to shoot her?
just the opposite.
he was flirting with her.
I didn't think he had it in him.
well, he had it in him at some point.
he has been married three times.
all redheads.
Melissa's a redhead.
that explains it.
wait, so is that woman who picks him up now and then. Who is she?
not a clue.
so he could really be attracted to Melissa?
you can't control who you're attracted to.
the whole Julia roberts-Lyle lovett thing proves that.
Billy joel, Christie brinkley.
I get it. - Angelina jolie, Billy bob thornton.
you haven't answered my question.
paulina porizkova and that guy from the cars.
if you're asking me whether Gibbs could get involved with a murder suspect, the answer is no.
three redheaded ex-wives says his judgment is a little questionable.
none of them were murder suspects.
although I don't know about the redhead who picks him up now and then.
a 22-year-old marine buys a term life policy for 750 grand, then kicks two months later from a heart attack?
no way I wanted to pay that claim.
but you did.
I was overruled from upstairs.
three quarter of a million dollar question, why?
the sister threatened to sue.
see, juries get angry when insurance companies don't pay, especially to the only survivor of a marine injured while serving his country.
they tend to award very large multi- million-dollar payments as punishment.
cheaper to pay her off.
it's our form of insurance.
anything turn up in the investigation?
nothing that would convince a jury.
try us.
okay.
but you two think like her lawyer.
why'd he buy a big policy at such a young age, and name a half-sister beneficiary?
half-sister or not, she was his only living relative.
and why'd your salesmen sell it to him if it was so unusual?
why was he cremated before an autopsy could be performed, at the sister's request?
coroner thought an autopsy was unnecessary.
many people prefer cremation over tombs.
do I need to go on?
no. You've made your point.
if you can prove this was a scam, we'll recover something, if only satisfaction.
six cups and it isn't even noon.
Oh, Duck, this one's bothering me.
Yeah, so Abby said.
you have her doing the same test twice.
Dorn's leg shows up in a trash bin.
tox screen shows digitalis, which is probably what he and/or his sister gave the marine in Harmony two years ago to pull off an insurance scam.
sounds reasonable.
so who killed Dorn a few days ago?
why toss his leg into a trash bin?
and why can't we find the rest of his body?
I recall a case in the forensic journal where the only evidence was a thumb found in the coin return of a pay phone.
yeah? And?
well, that's the only part I remember.
Aw, Ducky, this is not helping me.
have you identified the body the sister claims was Dorn's?
cremated and spread over the Blue ridge mountains.
Ah, well, that does pose a problem.
who would you get to pose as a marine?
you.
Yeah.
well, I would.
match!
it's not from the same tree.
the manual says it takes three minutes to change a tire on the LAV-25.
the manual was written by an army pogue!
I say marines can do it in less than two!
what do you say? - Ooh-rah!
make it happen.
gunny Vesta.
special agent Gibbs, NCIS.
I recall an M. P. Gibbs. Lejeune.
long time ago.
could be.
he was high and tight.
not exactly long and shaggy, gunny.
seen sheep dogs shorter.
don't recall you.
court street. J-ville.
broke up a lot of brawls there.
I was one of them.
got me a week in the brig.
gonna hold that against me?
Nah.
you was one of the better prison chasers.
you gave us smoke breaks on our work detail.
that's why I remember you.
45 seconds!
how can I help you, Gibbs?
PFC Thomas dorn.
ain't heard that sandbagger's namesince he od'd a couple of years ago.
death certificate says heart attack.
Coke-induced, I'll bet.
if he was a cokehead, why didn't you boot his butt out?
car accident beat me to it.
he have any buds?
a couple. He was, uh, he was tight with a corporal Morgan.
he went UA same time Dorn kicked.
bet you never found him, right?
not that I heard of.
probably holed up in some backwaterville with that redhead they used to run with.
Yeah, that's her name.
she was a fox.
and both Dorn and Morgan were shacking up with her.
you know her?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, know her.
Dorn's half sister.
she didn't act like no sister.
minute 30!
why are you, uh, why are you asking about this now?
Dorn's leg was found deep-sixed in a dumpster two days ago.
two days?
some ghoul dig him up?
no. Had Beaucoup life insurance.
from what you just told me, it looks like he and Melissa killed corporal Morgan.
she identified the body as Dorn, cremated him, claimed the insurance.
then who killed Dorn?
well, foxy lady may be a black widow.
Ooh-rah!
you want to tell them?
Hey, what's wrong?
look at it.
looks like a match.
precisely.
that's good work, Abby.
no, it's not!
you gave me two samples from the same tree.
b matched and A didn't!
I screwed up!
sycamore A was from a tree down the street.
what?
the idea of matching plant DNA was a bit hinky for me.
Oh, ye of little faith.
Abby, come on. All I did was give you a blind test.
well, you could have done that by not telling me which sample came from the suspect sycamore!
I didn't think of that.
this puts Dorn at Melissa's house.
you know what that means?
you got probable cause.
Tony, you take the barn.
Kate, you got the house.
what are you gonna take?
that didn't come out right. Not what I meant.
Yeah, I know what you meant.
well, was my coffee that good?
we're here to execute a search warrant.
for what?
my brother died two years ago.
his body was cremated.
don't you mean it was corporal Morgan's body that was cremated?
this has to be the cleanest barn ever.
if she uses a service, I got to have that number.
I really don't know what you think you're gonna find here.
why do you keep staring at me?
I could never have killed Tommy.
I loved him.
a gunny who knew both of you told me the same thing.
funny, though.
he didn't know that you were brother and sister.
looks like you could use a glass of water.
thank you.
have Abby compare her prints with those on her brother's leg.
blood on the floor, nicks in the concrete.
looks like they were made by a power saw.
gotta be where she did her slicing and dicing.
what? - There's someone else.
who else is here?
who else is here?
Boss,I'd like you to meet Dr. Sylvia chalmers...
who loves estee lauder.
Dr. Chalmers!
good afternoon, agent Todd.
you were in on it! - In on what, my dear?
they know, mama.
mama? / Mama?
they didn't know I was your mama until you told them, dear.
I know I should have told you all back in Harmony, but the mother in me had to protect my only child.
it was wrong. I know that.
but her wicked half-brother intimidated her into defrauding an insurance company when his friend had a heart attack.
brought on by an overdose of digitalis.
what in the world would make you think that?
couldn't be from a forensic test.
Melissa had his body cremated.
Hey, notice how it's all you, Melissa?
a marine has a heart attack in my office.
Melissa identifies him as her half brother, who I've never met.
now, how am I involved?
Mother...you defrauded an insurance company.
I'm afraid you're going to have to take your punishment for that...and only that.
boy, oh, boy, you are good, but so are we.
we found your digitalis in Thomas dorn's leg.
my digitalis?
every doctor and hospital in this country uses digitalis.
each order has its own chemical marker.
how else would a manufacturer recall a specific batch if they had a quality control problem?
you shouldn't have done it, mama.
calm yourself, Melissa. Just calm yourself.
they can only prove that you defrauded an insurance company.
no, mama.
they can prove everything.
they know you killed them with digitalis.
they know you cut up Tommy into little pieces, and they know you threw him away in the garbage...
she's just hysterical.
you can't use any of this in court.
she was read her rights.
she waived them.
we can use it all.
we will.
you little fool.
they couldn't prove anything.
I don't care anymore, mama.
I loved Tommy, and you murdered him.
they just found the left arm in a garbage dump at Chiefton.
where does that leave us?
that's a right arm from Katy lick, a torso from Marshville and the original leg from the dumpster in Clarksburg.
still no head or left leg.
well, which I'm betting are going to be turning up around lake Floyd or Jarvisville.
did you check Hooterville?
Where's Hooterville?
you guys, petticoat junction?
green acres? Hooterville?
I prefer TV shows from this century.
Oh, come on. They're hilarious.
when we were in college, we had this drinking game...
and the drugs collect in a solvent layer, and that leaves only proteins and biological material behind.
huh? - That's great, Abby.
I'll make sure to get that in the report.
what report?
we got Humpty-Dumpty back together?
most of him.
melon and left leg are still outstanding.
any more tattoos?
just the rose on Kate's butt.
it's not a rose.
he doesn't know.
he is lying just like he did about the digitalis.
okay, tell them.
well if my old man find something about biking with you he'll kill us both.
Oh, yeah? If your old man was a man, I might be worried.
Wayne, you got to get me back, I'm serious.
I'll get you a ride.
what if he doesn't stop?
Oh, he'll stop.
Hey!
stop!
you stupid bastard!
when I get through with you you're going to wish...
you were dead!
he's dead.
massive internal bleeding in the abdominal cavity, Gerald.
that's enough.
my young friend, you must have been in acute pain for many hours.
what kept you from seeking help, I wonder?
run the gut for me, would you, please, Gerald?
not a problem.
it's definitely a blockage.
it's strange, through. It seems to consist of a cluster of objects.
gallstones?
Oh, my, no.
gallstones that large could never pass through the cystic duct.
and even if they did, they wouldn't all be expelled at the same time.
although I did find a gallbladder once with almost a kilo of large stones.
of course, the victim was a sumo wrestler who weighed over 200 kilos.
he was in the middle of a bout. He just went
they're stones, doc.
not gallstones.
emeralds.
it was lodged in his gastrointestinal tract causing perforation of the peritoneum, internal bleeding, infection and death.
he swallowed emeralds. - He did, indeed.
I'm going to take a wild guess here, doc.
he smuggled them into the country.
it's from where he smuggled them in, Jethro.
our sailor just arrived from Guantanamo bay, Cuba, where he was a translator.
petty officer second class Khalil sa'id, naturalized american citizen, born in Egypt.
worked as a translator at camp Delta, fluent in arabic, uyghur, pashtu.
died in his car on route 522 near Fredricksburg.
almost killed a pair of bikers.
vroom-vroom bikers or pedal bikers?
I said bikers, Tony, not cyclists.
bikers is a term that refers to both cyclists...
next of kin? / None in the states. No U. S. Address, either.
and apparently he rotated from our naval station in Bahrain to Gitmo five months ago.
Where'd he get those emeralds?
Gitmo exchange?
sorry.
get your gear. We're going to Gitmo.
that's a good one, boss.
he was kidding, right?
I don't think so.
we're going to cuba! Ha-ha!
Hey, Gibbs.
I've got a gemologist coming over to look at the rocks.
he's my mother's friend's sister's son.
does he know his stuff? - I went out with him, like, once.
didn't get very far.
this all from the car?
Yeah.
it was a rental.
any classified material? - Not in the suitcases.
they could've swapped his hard drive before he left.
check it, anyway.
these were in the suitcase.
stamped, no postmark.
all the same return address.
NCIS special agent Paula cassidy.
you know her? - No, but I will.
okay, smell this.
do those turn you on, Abby?
turned somebody on.
box of condoms, half empty.
the price tag says they'refrom the Gitmo exchange.
Hey, maybe it was a package deal.
see if you can brand the cologne.
why, you want some?
Nope, don't use cologne.
the women I date think the smell of sawdust is sexy.
that's why I don't date many women.
Oh!
sorry.
you had better have a good reason for spilling my coffee.
I do.
I booked us on the first AMC flight to Gitmo tomorrow.
Unbook it.
I knew it.
I told Kate you were pulling my leg.
the navy's giving us a priority ride today.
you mean it?
you do mean it.
normally, I hate priority rides, but who cares if it's going...?
what's wrong with priority rides? - Come on, boss.
tell me you like sitting on canvas seats slung between cargo pallets.
Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm back in the corps.
I love priority rides.
boss, this is the best.
I miss canvas seats.
check this out.
what do you want?
get to work. - I already started.
Guantanamo enjoys a year-round tropical climate, cooled by the breezes from the windward passage.
some of the more popular pastimes include skin diving, sunbathing and horseback riding.
I would be the last one to rain on your parade, Fidel, but you're logged onto an official navy web site.
it's PR.
this isn't.
it's the NCIS file on special agent Paula cassidy.
she's an interrogator at camp Delta.
special agent Cassidy is not to know that Sa'id is dead.
we're not working with her?
Sa'id was carrying five unmailed letters of hers.
until we find out how she was involved with him, she's out of the loop.
I can't believe we're in a $40-million gulfstream.
I mean, it's got to be CNO's or SECNAV's.
you know, Tiger woods has one of these.
Tom cruise, all the big movie stars. This is their ride.
Yeah, boss? - Can we get to work?
sure thing. Just...
check this out.
it's a gulfstream.
so much for the element of surprise.
welcome to Gitmo.
I'm special agent Paula cassidy.
special agent Jethro gibbs.
special agent Kate todd, / Hi. how are you?
special agent Anthony dinozzo Hey. / Hello.
I heard you all were coming.
nice ride.
you are so right there.
this is yours.
there's a map in it.
they've put you up in one of the nicest houses on the base.
we appreciate that, special agent Cassidy.
so is there something going down that I should know about?
no.
it's just that all my transcripts have been pulled, my interrogations have been canceled, and then you all arrive on a navy gulfstream.
how would you connect the dots?
I wouldn't.
okay.
enjoy your stay.
okay.
we'll set up here.
tomorrow morning, we'll be joined by the senior FBI translator, covering transcripts of Sa'id's translations.
the interrogator...
special agent Cassidy.
no way!
it's the only bedroom with a bath.
I know, and I picked it first.
women take baths, men take showers, Tony.
why does the woman thing come up when a ship is sinking or when there's only one bedroom with a bath?
Gibbs. / Well, you were right about Sa'id's laptop.
his system's a virgin.
well, we'll track down the hard drive he had here and ship it to you.
when is your rock boy coming?
in the morning.
my mother's very excited.
find anything else? - Yeah, I picked up another scent on his shorts and his T-shirts.
what did Sa'id do, bathe in the stuff?
no, it's not his.
it's peach and musk with vanilla as a top note.
it'd definitely feminine.
well, tag it.
perfume is expensive, Gibbs.
I can't just hang out at the macy's tester tray with my lab kit.
they frown on that sort of behavior.
buy what you need to, Abby. We'll deal with it later.
bold, Gibbs, bold.
we're finished. - And we need to talk to you.
whatever. It'll have to wait till the morning.
it's kind of important.
appreciate that.
I'm going to bed.
talk to you manana.
any preference on the remaining bedrooms?
no. They're both equally crappy.
you pick. - Ladies first.
night.
God!
Halt!
I need coffee.
Where'd you get this, Abby?
if I told you, I'd have to kill you, Benjamin.
this is very sweet, but you did not have to bring me a gift.
well, I wanted to.
and your mother said it was something you could use.
Oh, right on. Thanks.
Benjamin, this is great.
so, the emerald, is it real?
Oh, it's very real.
color grade 2. 5,
tone one to two, clarity I-one.
it's at least worth $20, 000.
and the color's quite distinct.
it's bluish-apple green.
and the fluid inclusions are quite different than colombian stones.
this emerald was mined in the Panshir valley.
Where's that?
afghanistan.
bill. Senior translator, camp Delta.
we've been expecting you. Special agent Gibbs, special agents Dinozzo and Todd.
when the fbi relaxes their dress code, they sure go for it.
these are the transcripts of the interrogations of Nasser al jazair you requested.
the translator was Sa'id?
that's right. Apparently there's a problem?
did you know him? - Only to say hello.
he worked with your interrogator, Paula cassidy.
you might want to think about keeping that door shut.
iguanas have been known to wander inside.
Nasser arrived in june from Afghanistan.
Yes. Insists he was picked up by mistake.
ha. weren't they all.
agent Cassidy did especially well with the subject.
younger detainees feel more comfortable with female interrogators.
once rapport's been established, prisoner is only interrogated by that team.
I understand agent Cassidy's not in the loop on this?
correct.
I booked you an interrogation room for this afternoon.
we'd better get started.
okay, I want to know more about agent Cassidy.
who her friends are in Gitmo. How she spends her free time.
where she hangs out.
is she involved with Sa'id.
sure. / No problem.
did I say both of you?
well, you didn't not say both of us, Gibbs.
Yes, she's kind of got a point there, boss.
well, I'm saying it now.
DiNozzo, you go.
Kate will stay here and help me with this.
got it.
do you mind telling me why he...? - Yeah.
agent Cassidy has a lot of friends, I'll say that.
mostly male friends, and mostly either interrogators or translators.
Where's she hang?
club on base called El floridita.
check it out.
observe her if she's there.
can I drink? / Sure.
sasparilla.
sasparilla? - Who drinks sasparilla?
who's shane?
alan ladd.
who's Alan ladd? - Maybe you should check her out, Kate.
I'm on it.
Where's agent dinozzo?
drinking sasparilla.
they'll bring Nasser down as soon as the evening prayers are finished.
why aren't you praying?
I'm presbyterian.
how do you say good cop, bad cop in arabic?
I learned my arabic at the defense language institute in monterey.
that phrase wasn't in the syllabus.
Nasser should be here in about five minutes.
watch his body language.
fortunately, Nasser speaks some english.
so, Jack palance shoots Elisha cook.
the slug lifts his body off the ground, and splat, right into the mud.
you ever seen the maltese falcon?
Nope. / Oh, you young people don't know what good movies are.
all this violence today, so sad.
splat isn't violent?
what are you drinking?
sarsaparilla.
root beer.
so you're on duty? - Maybe I just like sarsaparilla.
Cosmo, Jimmy.
coming up.
that's funny. I knew you were going to order a cosmo.
are you here to check me out?
define checking out.
come on, what are you doing here?
straight up?
no, I.I want you to lie to me.
you turn me on.
here, let me pay. - No, thanks.
I buy my own drinks.
so, Jack palance shoots Elijah wood?
he asks who we are.
name is Gibbs.
u. S. Naval criminal investigative service.
sit down.
where is Paula?
she's been replaced...
by me.
Why?
I think you know why.
no.
well, sit down, Nasser. I'll tell you why.
Sa'id is dead.
he's praying.
thank you.
miss me?
like herpes.
that confuses me.
Really? / Absolutely.
if you don't like me, then why do you keep coming over here for refills?
I like the game.
me, too.
your move.
you've been here eight months, and you haven't hooked up.
well, how do you know?
you danced with five different guys. Nothing going on with any of them.
you're counting the men that I'm dancing with?
I'm the jealous type.
huh. Jimmy, does he seem like the jealous type?
I thought so...
see? / Till he flashed his badge when I wouldn't answer any questions about you.
more info than she needed, Jimmy.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
what if I told you I was checking out the competition?
I'd say you were lying. - No, it's true.
I'm checking out the competition.
for your investigation.
and for me.
so, what are you going to write in your report?
that you have rules about hooking up with men you work with.
accurate?
incomplete.
I have rules about guys that investigate me, too.
never broken a rule?
have you?
if the risk is worth it.
Jimmy, un tequila y una cerveza, por favor.
let's dance.
Sa'id was a good man.
he gave me hope I would see my family again.
he said america does not hate islam...
that Allah knows we are here.
don't you want to know how he died?
or have you guessed? - He guessed.
how would I know?
we have no contact here with the outside world.
he swallowed these.
they killed him.
think he got them from you.
I don't understand.
says he's never seem them before.
he'd like to return to his cell, so he can pray for his friend's soul.
tell him he's not going back to his cell.
he's being transferred to isolation.
he says he was promised a transfer to minimum security.
who promised him that?
special agent Cassidy.
one second.
back at the house...
be there in five.
I'm back on duty.
well, that's too bad.
so are you.
why'd you recommend transferring Nasser to minimum security?
reward for cooperation.
that's the idea around here. - We read the transcripts.
he didn't tell us anything we didn't know.
well, that's not the point. He told us all that he knows.
are you sure?
it's a judgment call, but we get a lot of flack around here for holding people too long.
are you going to tell me what's going on?
are you going to tell us what was going on between you and Sa'id?
we worked together.
that's all.
these were found in Sa'id's luggage.
well, he was going to put them in the mail for me.
couldn't find the post office?
mail is slow out of Gitmo.
Sa'id was on his way to the states, and I asked him to throw them in the mail for me.
you mind of we open them? - Yes, I mind.
they're private. - We'll get a court order.
what the hell is this about?
why do you have these letters?
something happen to Sa'id?
he's dead.
Oh, my god.
how? what happened?
tell me how he died.
internal bleeding from a perforated bowel caused by the presence of hard objects in his intestines. / Hard objects, what the hell is that supposed to mean?
look...
I have been a damn good NCIS agent for over six years now.
I really don't deserve to be treated like this.
all we asked is, can we open these letters?
sure, go ahead. Open the damn things.
thank you.
they're to my family. Would you like to...
search my apartment while you're at it? / I will.
okay.
sorry, Paula.
check out Sa'id's apartment, too.
first time I've seen you apologize to a suspect.
how would you feel if I was going to search your apartment?
violated beyond belief.
you know why you're attracted to her, though, don't you? / Who said I was?
it's endorphins. - Well, thank you, Abby.
Oh, you were so excited about going to cuba and riding in the jet.
it stimulated the hell out of your endorphins.
the first woman you saw was like honey to a bear.
you were the first woman I saw on my endorphin high.
Yeah, well, we work together, Tony. It's like a brother-sister thing.
never had a sister.
that's probably a good thing. - You just passed Sa'id's room, sis.
need some help?
no.
Tony, wait.
Sa'id had a key to her apartment.
well, she doesn't have a key to his.
women like making love in their own bed.
now, wait a minute, just 'cause you're a woman and you enjoy doing it in your own bed. / you're right, I misspoke.
does not mean that all women - I was wrong, Tony.
insist on doing it in their own bed. - Let it go.
going to read me my rights?
you have the right to be reimbursed for postage.
put it on your expense report.
Thanks.
you might want to take that chip off your shoulder.
gladly.
just treat me as a member of the team.
we're in the same agency, not on the same team.
is this interrogation over?
Yeah. Yeah, almost. Uh...
why is special agent Dinozzo sorry?
he blew his chance to get laid.
this just came for you from Guantanamo bay.
it's Sa'id's hard drive.
excellent.
Ah...
quite a collection.
Yeah, I'm trying to match a scent I found on Sa'id's clothes.
I don't see chanel number five.
does anyone wear that anymore?
my mother does.
Really?
ever since Marilyn monroe confessed that chanel number five was all she wore to bed.
so, does your mother...?
unfortunately, yes.
makes for terribly awkward slumber parties.
Nasser is extremely upset.
feels he's been cooperative and now he's in a cell with no windows.
well, maybe after losing all this luxury, he'll be even more cooperative.
a psychiatrist examined him and is worried for his mental health.
I'm not all that interested in the mental health of people who want to kill me.
you certain Nasser's a terrorist?
isn't it possible he is what he says he is.
a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
Yeah, and it's also possible that he's the man who gave Sa'id those emeralds.
why would he do that?
are you that naive?
or did Nasser pass some of those emeralds on to you?
what are all these bottles, Abby?
that's the perfume you said I could buy.
did we have to buy so many?
I only got 30.
there's more than 2, 500 on the market.
you're kidding me.
perfume is the most powerful accessory a woman can wear.
Yeah, well, how much did all this power cost us?
around $1, 500.
$1, 500?
well, that's not including the tax.
I stuck to the 30 most popular scents, hoping we'd get lucky.
Ah...
how fiscally responsible, Ab.
thank you. / So, we get any bang for our 1, 500 bucks?
we did.
the perfume on Sa'id's clothes is called escada.
never heard of it.
you wanna hear about his hard drive?
what's it going to cost me?
it's pretty much synonymous with his sex drive.
our boy deleted 20 gigs of porn before he turned his drive in.
he was trading with a porn pal on a hotmail account that doesn't exist anymore.
anything good on it?
nothing with sawdust yet.
agent Cassidy's?
Yeah. Uh...
nothing else of interest in her apartment, except...
what?
she had a bottle of escada on her dresser, and Sa'id had a key to her apartment, but she did not have a key to his.
most women prefer their own beds.
so, she and Sa'id were doing the horizontal salsa.
not according to the bartender at El floridita.
what, lovers register with him at Gitmo first?
bartenders know this kind of stuff, boss.
he said she went there most nights, danced with a lot of guys, but...
always went home alone.
What'd you find out, Kate?
Sa'id's place wasn't just clean, it was sterilized.
there were some towels, soap and a half a roll of toilet paper.
I think Sa'id copied Paula's key without her knowing it.
now, which brain is thinking that, Dinozzo?
I'm hitting the rack.
get this off to Abby first thing in the morning.
you know, Gibbs, - sometimes you can be a real... - bastard?
Yes.
Yeah, well, my gut is telling me agent Cassidy's telling the truth.
so, then, what's the problem?
romance between agents, Kate...
it never works.
you speaking from experience?
Sa'id and I were not lovers.
who told you that?
room key.
had yours on his key chain.
that's not possible.
how would he get my room key?
you gave it to him.
no, I didn't.
I lost a key.
had to replace one.
Sa'id could've stolen it.
are you just remembering now that you lost a key?
I was just told that somebody else had it.
okay.
okay, let's say that I buy that.
why would he want a key to your room?
to get to my computer.
but how does he get my password?
if you don't keep your doors shut, the iguanas get in.
we did so many interrogations together...
he could've watched me type it in.
why would Sa'id want to get into your computer?
to read my interrogation reports.
I don't know.
lately, I noticed that his conversations with Nasser seemed longer than his translations.
I even noted that in my computer.
Sa'id... took leave and left the next day for the states, right after I wrote that.
his room was empty. He wasn't intending to come back.
I should've had bill come and sit in on one of the interrogations and check my suspicions.
I blew it.
these are the hard objects that Sa'id had in his stomach when he died.
emeralds?
I think he got them from Nasser.
but how did Nasser get them past our body search?
Nasser complained of constipation when he arrived, and they gave him a laxative.
he got them in the same way Sa'id got them out.
what are you looking at, Abby?
it's just sex, Ducky.
just sex?
Yeah.
you know, biological act between creatures within a species in response to neurological and physiological stimuli.
between creatures within their species?
usually.
this isn't yours, I hope.
no.
it's off Sa'id's hard drive.
but something's wrong.
the files are too big.
not just the files.
Easter eggs.
what the hell are easter eggs?
Easter eggs are hidden messages within a computer program.
if you don't know to look, you don't know they're there.
they were hidden in the porn?
my cursor has moved across places that would make Tony blush.
what kind of messages?
there's a diagram of the camp, and a bunch of stuff in arabic.
it's coming to you now.
something tells me it's not a greeting from the bunny.
Sa'id arrived Gitmo april 23.
april 28, he writes,
son-in-law located.
may 11,
son-in-law moved to minimum security.
may 23, he gets a response.
leader disavows son-in-law.
he will be eliminated by the one who is victorious.
leader?
bin laden.
my god, we've got one of Bin laden's son-in-laws here and didn't know it.
the one who is victorious?
why does he start talking in riddles all of a sudden?
I don't think he is.
I may not be translating that accurately.
it's old arabic for the one who is victorious.
I, uh, owe you an apology, Gibbs.
if I transferred Nasser into minimum security...
you didn't. Don't worry about it.
how do we find this son-in-law?
easy.
we transfer Nasser to minimum security so he can kill him.
in camp Delta, the security buck stops with me.
if Nasser kills a detainee, it'll be my ass.
yeah...
but once the son-in-law learns that Bin laden ordered him murdered, he's going to sing like a bird in islamic paradise, and maybe that prevents another 9/11.
what's your plan, Gibbs?
we transfer Nasser to minimum security.
from isolation to minimum security? He's bound to be suspicious.
new interrogator'll have to deliver the news convincingly.
since we know he trusts women, that's me.
no, that's me.
I'm the one he trusts.
you promised him minimum security. He got isolation.
he won't believe you have the authority to move him.
he will when I order the guards to remove the shackles.
that's too risky. - Tony's right.
Nasser and Sa'id did this right in front of me.
you're an interrogator, not a translator.
you couldn't have known.
but I did.
I had suspicions about Sa'id, and I let them slide.
it's inexcusable.
Yep.
let me make up for it.
how good an actress are you, agent Cassidy?
ask Tony.
he bought my act.
icing me was an act?
no.
letting you think I was melting was.
Tony, she'd say anything to get in that room.
Kate, it's not a problem. We were both playing a game.
yeah...
who won?
Hello, Nasser.
I did not expect we'd meet again.
neither did I.
remove the shackles.
now, please.
where is Gibbs?
recalled to washington.
his superiors determined that his concerns were unfounded.
he's not buying it.
he will.
agent Gibbs has had problems in the past.
agent Cassidy, this isn't appropriate.
he deserves to know.
he has a history of building cases at the expense of the facts.
tell him.
she's good.
I was locked up like a dog.
it was out of my hands, Nasser. I'm sorry.
I've arranged to have you returned to your cell.
just answer one question.
do you have a conscience?
I have a moral awareness of my actions.
good.
because I've trusted you, Nasser.
I'm glad you are back.
so am I.
she's ending the session. What is she doing?
playing him.
he's asking about the transfer to minimum security you promised him.
I'll try.
we have 120 detainees in minimum security at present.
20 to a unit.
barracks 20 is the one Nasser is assigned to, and this...
that's the inside surveillance cam.
how many guards do you have inside the barracks?
two. One on each exit, front and rear.
odds are six-to-one against his target being billeted in the same barracks as him.
that means Nasser is going to have to kill his target in the exercise yard.
what does secret service think?
three sharp shooters, there, there, and one in the watchtower.
I have an idea.
it's about time.
Nasser has to change his jumpsuit - when he transfers, right? - Spanking brand-new white one, so?
so I want to add a little trim.
you're being transferred to minimum security, Nasser.
you have kept your word.
does that surprise you?
no.
don't betray my trust, Nasser.
I will not.
right there. they're bringing him out now.
talk about your own personal web-cam.
we only did enough of the search to keep it legitimate.
you think he already has a weapon?
Oh, yeah, I do. Probably a shiv.
it makes sense. Easy to conceal.
how does he make a shiv in max security?
a comb, a toothbrush, something innocuous ground to a point.
you're good.
bet you could've made it in hollywood.
I don't know if I'm hoping you're right or wrong about Nasser.
he's a killer.
it's in his eyes. / Yeah...
the eyes always give you away.
Oh, yeah.
your target is the fifth detainee to exit.
acknowledge when you have him in your sights.
Roger that.
okay, I've got him.
that's a diversion.
lost target. Repeat, no shot.
My.my sniper's lost his target.
he's heading in the opposite direction. He switched groups.
he's going into barracks 21.
he's made his man.
where are your guards, colonel?
NCIS, open it up!
DiNozzo, go around back!
got it!
go!
get down!
I'd have killed him.
and make him a martyr?
no.
this is worse than death.
she looks awfully lonely back there.
so?
so... I think one of us should go and keep her company.
Why?
she is one of us.
what?
well, I can't let her ride alone.
why is it that women always want to fix what doesn't need fixing?
makes us feel all warm inside.
so does scotch, but it doesn't cost you a house.
I didn't really think... - I didn't think that...
you go.
watch this.
it's a gulfstream.
I heard a noise.
come on. Aren't you gonna check?
check what?
that.
it's probably just Bella.
damn it, Rod, why didn't you answer me? You scared the hell out of me.
turn over and lay on your stomach.
do as I say and you won't get hurt.
do it.
3 o'clock in the morning, you hear a strange noise, what do you do?
slide a pistol from under my pillow and go after the guy.
I'm talking about real people, Kate.
why do they always feel the need to go look?
it's called human nature, Tony.
Ah. Let me guess.
you're that person in a horror movie that decides that since all your friends are dead, you really need to check out the demonic breathing noise down in the basement?
look, that beats being the girl who twists her ankle and gets everyone else killed.
you sleep with a gun under your pillow every night?
it depends. - On what?
on who I'm sleeping with.
um, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Tony just asked what I do if a man came into my bedroom and I said it depends.
I mean, it doesn't depend on the man...
Tony, could you help me out here, please?
she sleeps with a gun, boss.
is that true?
sort of... sometimes...
Yes.
good girl.
what do we know about last night?
not much.
the fugitive is a former seal named Jack curtin.
he somehow managed to escape from Leavenworth, and nobody seems to know how.
we do know he broke into a house at 0340
and scared the hell out of two civilians before stealing the guy's clothes.
get me everything on him, birth to last night.
I thought Leavenworth was army CID jurisdiction?
CID's gonna search where he's been.
we're gonna find out where he's going.
have Leavenworth pack up Curtin's cell, overnight it to Abby.
I want everything but the paint on the walls.
you got it.
do we know what this guy was in for?
same thing I'm gonna be, if you don't get your ass moving.
right.
murder.
and you didn't even use a lifeline.
what makes you so sure he's not running to Canada or Mexico?
he spent a year in pretrial confinement.
if he wanted to run, he wouldn't have waited until he was sent to Leavenworth.
if he wanted to kidnap his kid, he could've done that back then, too.
well, yeah, there is that.
so why are we here?
I want you to keep an eye on his son till I can arrange for a protection detail.
is that a nice way of saying baby-sit?
Hey, you're catching on.
has your grandson received any calls or letters from his father recently?
no. And if he did, I wouldn't let him hear or read them.
has he had any contact with his father since you were awarded custody?
we were granted custody because his father murdered two people.
one of them was his mother, our daughter.
so why would we give him visitation?
you think Jack might try to contact Kevin.
it's a possibility. - Oh, my god. If you don't mind...
I'm going out front.
I'll take you out in a few minutes, Kevin.
I can go by myself.
we're almost done. - I wanna go now.
with that attitude you're not going anywhere.
nice board.
mind if I check it out?
Yeah, I do.
he's angry. / Yeah.
I don't blame him. - All he does is ride that sKateboard or sit by himself and draw.
his father is probably running for a border.
but I'm gonna leave agent Todd here for awhile.
if the phone rings, you let her answer it.
you on a roll? - Aren't I always?
guess you don't need this, then, huh?
you need it. I like it.
Kate get you the stuff from Curtin's cell?
it's on its way. Kate rules.
thought Abby ruled.
good women don't mind sharing a throne, Gibbs.
how about just sharing what you found, Abbs?
I will, when I find it.
I'm still downloading the saint data from Leavenworth.
that's one acronym I don't know. - It's like lojack for inmates.
it should be able to tell us when and where our chicken flew the coop.
I am much more interested in how, and with whose help.
got it. / Good.
I haven't had anything to do with petty officer Curtin since I prosecuted the case.
where did he run after the murders?
he didn't.
he was the one who called the police.
he called the police on himself?
insisted he was innocent.
claimed he came home and found them dead.
a victim of circumstance.
said his wife might have been involved with drug dealers.
it all fell apart pretty fast.
he end up confessing? / No.
but he had both victims' blood all over him, and his fingerprints were on the murder weapon.
it was pretty obvious what happened.
he came home, found his wife upstairs with the cable guy and lost it.
guess he picked the wrong housewife to give a free upgrade, huh?
is that your idea of humor, special agent Dinozzo?
is that your idea of a sharp pencil?
you know which one I'm talking about.
not going to poke anyone's eye out with that one.
are we finished here?
was the cable guy doing the missus?
actually, he really was just fixing the cable.
Curtin was just paranoid and freaked.
why wasn't he on death row?
he was granted leniency due to post traumatic stress.
from the cable going out?
slightly amusing?
come on, counselor, you got to give me something to work with here.
I have clients to see, - agent Dinozzo. - Why did Curtin freak?
everyone thinks because the Taliban fell fast, it was a cakewalk.
but for the guys over there, it was anything but.
anybody testify on his behalf?
someone he would go to for help?
Curtin haloed into Afghanistan on september 12th with nothing but an MP-5, a K-bar knife, and a radio.
doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who needs help.
I appreciate your help, commander Coleman.
it's been a lot of laughs.
now that's funny.
petty officer first class Jack curtin.
he's hard core, boss. / Yeah?
what's your definition of hard core?
grew up in foster homes. Enlisted at 17.
went from boot camp to buds, which is unusual.
went through hell in Afghanistan, which apparently isn't.
his entire seal team showed up at his trial as character witnesses.
Where's his team now? - Mostly deployed.
Tony, I'm going to need you to go...track them down and see if Curtin contacted them?
or I could let you finish your question.
you have the name of the team commander?
current or past? / Both.
current's location is classified.
satcom can be arranged as soon as he becomes available.
and when that'll be is...
classified. / Unknown.
past is stationed at little creek. A commander William foley.
where exactly at little creek?
uh, there, exactly.
it's a brave new world, boss.
well, if he's looking for help from an old teammate, he'll have to go to Iraq to get it.
you're here.
hazards of promotion.
you had any contact with Curtin since his conviction?
no.
not that I'd avoid it.
Jack was a good man.
he's convicted of killing two people.
agent Gibbs, you know what it's like to spend every free moment dreaming about being home again, hugging your wife, hearing your kids laugh, only to come home and learn it's all gone?
it doesn't justify murder.
I didn't say it did.
anything else?
not for the moment.
that's very Jack webb.
Thanks.
Curtin definitely did his homework.
you got my attention, Abbs.
how'd he get out? - According to the computer, - he didn't. - I hate riddles.
saint tracks both inmates and guards through a single source data system that compares information on a digital smartcard that every inmate is required to carry, with some aspect of their physiology.
how about an explanation that doesn't require a digital smartcard?
okay.
you got a fingerprint. You got a card.
you swipe, you press, match-match.
the computer knows who you are and where you are.
the readers are in every cell and every entryway to locations within the prison.
so there's no need for bed checks or roll calls.
you saves time, you save money.
everybody wins. - Until an inmate hacks the system.
until an inmate hacks the system.
it was maximum security.
they don't get pencils, much less a laptop.
Yes, but they do give them toothpaste.
at first, I thought he molded a duplicate of his finger, but...
it's a guard's finger. / That's what I love about, you, Gibbs.
always one finger ahead. - Find out which guard.
I already have.
saint had the guard logged at the prison laundry for the last 22 hours.
which is odd for several reasons, but especially because it was his day off.
Curtin used a fake finger to get to the laundry.
and he hid in a hamper, and he went out with the whites.
how'd he get the guard's finger to make the mold?
easy.
kicked sand in his face.
watch this.
Curtin did a few fingertip pull-ups, and then challenged the guard to do the same.
I'm guessing that's not dirt he found above the door.
and I'm guessing that you're looking in the wrong direction, just like the guard.
watch.
so a finger he made of this fooled the computer.
the biometric readers note lines and ridges in three dimensions.
they don't check for a pulse.
a finger's useless without the smartcard that goes with it.
the guard lost his card two weeks after Curtin arrived.
in the incident report, he claimed that his dog ate it.
it didn't work for me in the sixth grade.
you're a late bloomer, Gibbs.
it didn't work for me in the second.
they don't have a way to disable lost cards?
they do, but they didn't.
guess they figured without the finger...
exactly.
well, they fingered wrong.
Kate. Checking out a noise in the kitchen.
Roger. Standing by.
what are you doing?- Nothing.
Oh, jeez.
code four, Mcgee.
just a little spilt milk.
Roger, that.
you've got to get back to bed, buddy.
it's late.
I'm hungry. - Have a piece of fruit.
I hate fruit.
bananas.
they're the closest thing to not being fruit that a fruit can be.
I don't know what that means, either.
just go to bed. - What about the floor?
if my grandma sees this, she...
don't worry about the floor. I got it, okay?
it's not a big deal, all right?
I've got the floor.
you just need to go back to bed for me.
one word...and the milk won't be the only thing spilled on the floor.
the whole neighborhood is under surveillance.
you'll never get away with him.
I didn't come here to take him away.
I came to say good-bye.
I never got a chance to say good-bye.
you could've just called, written a letter.
you don't have kids, do you?
he needs to know that I love him, and that this is the best place for him now.
so you can run away without feeling guilty?
I shouldn't have to run at all.
open your mouth. Open wide.
okay.
there you go. It's not too tight.
is it scary in jail?
sometimes.
because there's guys bigger than you?
well...
there's a lot of different reasons.
you think about your mom a lot?
Yeah.
so do I.
Kate. Mcgee. You got a sitrep for me?
Kate, you there? Come in.
no, don't go.
I have to. - No, dad, please.
radio check. Kate, you there?
where is he?
the back bedroom with Kevin.
my hands.
give me your phone.
this is NCIS special agent Todd.
we need immediate assistance at 10600 vincent.
we've got an armed federal escapee inside the house.
clear.
you can't shoot him.
Oh, man.
come here, bud.
what's going on?
he was here, now he's gone.
Kevin. / It's ok.
Kevin, you all right? - Go after him.
I'm gonna go back out front and see if he parked his car.
no. Tell them you found his car.
on the radio, notify the team, tell them you found his car, - and you got it covered. - Okay.
Kevin, do you know where your father's going?
Bravo four, this is bravo one.
we've found Curtin's vehicle. Got it covered.
repeat, we have found his vehicle. Standing by.
copy that. / Damn.
you think it'll work? - We'll find out.
stop! Get out of the car now!
get out of the car! - Okay. Okay.
out of the way!
checkpoints up?
on all the major roads.
APB went out on the car that got away, in at 0400.
one of the deputies just found an old pickup with Missouri plates.
reported stolen yesterday morning.
sounds like our guy's.
impound it? Bring it to the garage?
no, there's no time. Bag everything, get it to Abby.
will do, sir.
bag the windshield fragments, too. Get them to Abby.
then take photos. Both scenes.
What're you doing down here?
main office needed a temporary refill.
I was, uh, low on the pole.
Yeah, we got a lot of people out sick.
some kind of gastrointestinal bug going around.
you didn't use our toilet, did you?
Curtin snuck in last night. I didn't hear him.
he came to say good-bye to his boy.
and while he was saying good-bye?
I was, uh...tied up in the living room.
he has my weapon.
but I hit him with the shotgun.
how bad? - Don't know.
contact the ERS in the area.
tell them to be on the lookout for a GSV, and get them Curtin's photo. / Okay.
Where's the boy? - In his room.
you think he swam?
who? / Leavenworth's in Kansas.
the truck's from Missouri.
little thing called the Mississippi between the two.
well, actually there's a little thing called 200 miles between Leavenworth and the Mississippi.
try the Missouri.
Ah. Same thing.
all we know is, this guy swam across a big-ass river.
you enjoy this, don't you?
having fun at your expense?
Yeah.
really a lot.
are you going to arrest me?
for helping your dad?
Nah.
we don't arrest boys for that.
thought you might be hungry.
you know, when I was a kid, we used to take roller skates apart and nail them onto boards.
pretty unbelievable, huh?
Yeah, I'd be speechless, too.
I'm gonna guess that's your dad.
is he going to shoot someone, Kevin?
don't want to talk about it.
I understand that.
hardest thing for guys like us is talking.
what do you mean, "guys like us"?
I don't know, you just seem a little bottled up.
like me.
everyone thinks I should just spew, you know?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I know.
what are you bottled up about?
I let a guy get away from me.
bad guy.
he shot one of my people.
shot me.
where?
bothers me that I can't find him.
but I'm gonna find him.
I'm not gonna help you catch my dad.
that's okay.
Oh, that's okay.
ladies and gentlemen,
I want a hard-target search of every residence, gas station, farmhouse, hen house, doghouse and outhouse in the area, you got that?
good!
now, turn off those cameras and get out of the way.
accent's still not right.
Damn! - It's too Arkansas.
Tommy lee's more Texas.
you got to think more untamed, in your face.
Where's the stuff from Curtin's car?
it's there, but you're gonna want to see this first.
I haven't done a precipitin yet, but unless someone else was shot recently inside the car that Curtin carjacked,
I think Kate just unsealed our seal.
first shot, too. - How can you tell?
see the crenellated marks?
that's caused from blood spray hitting a perpendicular surface at a pretty good clip.
how do you know it's the first shot?
the first shot hit home and caused the blood to splatter inside the car.
the second... / blasted the stained glass onto the street.
stained glass.
it's very spiritual, Gibbs.
how severe a wound?
from a close range blast with double-ought buck, and considering his position behind the wheel and the fact that he hasn't turned up dead yet,
I'd say that he probably just got grazed, or he's down to one arm.
What're you looking for?
this.
from the glove compartment.
Yeah.
never known anyone who'd keep gloves in there.
well, now you do. You want to know why?
not really. - I don't like the sun.
Abby... / so when I have to go put gas in my car,
I have these vintage elbow-length gloves.
black?
Yes, they match my black lace vintage parasol.
at a gas station?
well, yeah. You can't be too careful, Gibbs, and you can't have an indoor gas station 'cause of all the fumes.
Abby? / Yeah.
can we move on?
sure.
it's a map of Washington, D. C.
Mm-hmm. A new one.
so? / This one isn't.
my guess is, he didn't know he had a D. C. Map in the glove compartment so he bought a new one.
Kevin obviously thinks his dad is out to shoot somebody.
he told me his dad has got to find someone, and then he's going to give himself up.
does he know who it is?
no. He seems to know something about the plan after he finds him.
if Curtin's like most inmates, he blames everyone but himself for his conviction.
there was a new D. C. road map in the car he abandoned.
both of the JAG lawyers involved in his trial have D. C. addresses.
what about the judge? - Retired. Lives in El paso.
Curtin also did right by all three of them.
Coleman didn't even contest the post-traumatic stress diagnosis.
Plus, the judge was lenient in sentencing.
so, who's he after?
Curtin told me he shouldn't have to run at all.
he's always insisted he was innocent.
so, you're saying we should be looking for a one-armed man.
very funny. - Maybe we should.
are you kidding, boss?
the repairman really was fixing the cable, the lawyers were professional, the judge was fair.
maybe the one person that Curtin still has a beef with is the one who killed his wife.
he's not running.
he's chasing.
nothing from area hospitals.
still checking smaller clinics, as well as doctors' offices.
he could have seen a vet.
uh, Tony's marking that territory.
cute. - I thought so.
I didn't.
nothing from the vets, boss.
APB on the car?
nothing. - Tired of hearing that word.
we think Curtin's innocent, right?
maybe.
assume he's innocent for the sake of argument.
Why?
because I said to.
innocent. Sure. Why not?
go on.
if Curtin's innocent, and he's going after the guy that murdered his wife and the cable repairman...
I don't think he cares about the cable repairman.
if Curtin knows the murderer, why didn't he say so when he was arrested?
he did.
he said, uh, he thought it might have been drug dealers?
generic. Not specific.
he's going out to get someone specific now.
he didn't know.
he found out who slit their throats while he was in prison.
what about the stuff that was in his cell?
be here in 20 minutes.
but I have a list of everything that's coining.
Curtin's cell had seven large file boxes containing appeals, police reports, uh, detective notes, crime scene photos, phone records and an official trial record.
he found something in one of those boxes that told him who killed his wife.
if he's innocent.
we're going to reinvestigate this case, from top to bottom.
get both of those JAG lawyers in here.
Kate, take prosecution.
Tony, defense.
on it. / On it.
central files. I need all our records on a murder case three years ago.
hi... / Petty officer first class Jack D. Curtin.
I want to know who here investigated the case.
no. No, you will not call me back. I'll hold.
what the hell are you doing?
can you form a sentence, agent Mcgee?
NCIS investigator was special agent Clay williamson, sir.
that's a good sentence.
he's retired and living on a boat.
gets his mail every three months in Tahiti.
what kind of boat?
I don't know, sir.
uh, but I was able to download his investigation from central files.
I want the evidence custody document so we can get...
already got it, sir.
I can call Norfolk and have the evidence transferred here.
how fast?
joint forces command has a helo shuttle to the Pentagon.
do it. - Okay, yes, sir.
you don't have to call me sir.
no, sir. - Lawyers?
commander Coleman is unhappily on her way.
the defense lawyer told me to shove it.
the message was actually delivered by his assistant, but he assured me it was verbatim.
I want him here, Dinozzo.
boss, he's no longer a JAG.
he's a $400 an hour beltway lawyer with really nice shoes.
DiNozzo, I don't care.
I don't care if he's wearing armani or prada, or ermin something zenga...
get his ass here!
it's ermenegildo zegna, boss.
just so you know.
evidence is on its way.
boss?
I'm going to own your house, agent dinozzo.
I rent.
you know what the federal minimums are for aggravated assault under color of authority, kidnapping, false imprisonment?
well, you know, I don't, but I'm sure my boss, special agent Jethro Gibbs, does.
very subtle, Dinozzo.
shooting him just seemed so ham-fisted.
whatever it takes.
uncuff him so he can say hello to an old friend.
I prefer him in cuffs.
wish I'd have known that when we were at JAG.
I want every photograph, witness statement, lab report, autopsy report, and anything else you find in these boxes reexamined.
petty officer Curtin may be innocent now, but if we don't find who he's after, - he will not be for long. - Innocent?
I believe Curtin told his son that he escaped from jail to get the person who murdered his mother.
and what was he going to tell his son?
I murdered your mother?
you had no eyewitnesses, no confession.
I had enough evidence to get a conviction.
guilty or innocent, you are both here to help us find...
who he is after before another murder is committed.
okay. If Curtin can prove he's innocent, why didn't he just tell the authorities?
would you listen? / No, but, if I was innocent, I'd keep telling people until someone did.
I wouldn't escape from prison and go after the killer myself.
that's why women aren't allowed in the SEALs.
because we think with the head on our shoulders?
they remind you of anybody?
no. / No.
me, neither.
evidence from Norfolk.
top box is, uh, autopsy. The rest is evidence collected at the scene.
top box goes on the table for Ducky.
everything else goes to the lab.
you take Abby with you.
I'm on her.
it. I'm, I'm...
I'm on it, sir.
I'm sorry.
no drugs found in either victim's blood.
special agent Williamson, who investigated, found he's sailing a 13 meter ketch, boss.
must be married. You can't single-hand a ketch.
take it you're not building a ketch in your basement.
of course not.
the basement's too small.
now, if I was getting 500 an hour,
I wouldn't care how long this little side bar went on, but since I'm here pro bono, can we?
special agent Williamson had a drug tox screen done on the wife's hair.
Nothing./ Okay. Curtain's drug dealer idea didn't pan out.
what did?
Curtin was convinced his wife was having an affair.
petty officer Curtin was paranoid.
first, drug dealers did it. When that didn't pan out, - it was a lover. - Was he paranoid?
no. / Yes.
proof? - Pass this, please.
the court-appointed psychiatrist found Curtin experienced severe insomnia in Afghanistan.
who didn't? / Sleep deprivation can cause paranoia.
so can a wife who's cutting another guy's jib.
Curtin's the type of guy who intimidates other SEALs.
who's going to make a move on his wife?
maybe she was the one making the moves.
where are her phone records?
there was nothing in them to indicate she had a lover.
unfortunately, she's right.
I checked out every number she called while he was overseas.
did you check her cell phone calls?
she didn't have a cell phone. - That's odd.
everyone has a cell phone.
I have a cell phone.
well, she didn't. - Her husband thought she did.
he subpoenaed every cell phone company in Virginia.
verizon, sprint, AT&T wireless.
and there's more.
these are subpoenas for prepaid cell phone providers.
floor four wireless, Bingham wireless,
Houston, the cell phone has landed.
prepaid cell phone records for one Margaret curtin from upfront phone dot com.
and the date on the subpoena was four weeks ago.
court's adjourned.
thank you for your cooperation, counselors.
special agent Todd will escort you out.
Tony, get on those numbers.
you'll let me knowhow this turns out.
of course.
afraid you put an innocent man in Leavenworth...
faith?
Yes.
but innocent or not, I still kicked your ass.
Hey, Pacci. / Tony.
how's the shoulder?
getting there. - Got a minute, Gibbs?
no, not really. - Working a hot case?
smoking!
Tony, I'm going to check on Ducky, then Abby.
give me a call the second... - I find anything.
I got it, boss.
what do you need?
Hey, you're busy.
it's a cold case.
what's one more day?
I think I got something useful from his accent.
what?
the terrorist.
he had a definite Euro accent, but he occasionally used British syntax.
I think his higher education was in the British isles.
Yeah. Well, that's all I have for the moment on that bastard.
but on the one who did these murders,
I've just found something really useful.
the M. E. misread the cause of death.
you'd think it was so obvious.
a massive loss of blood from a kitchen knife.
I mean, he sliced them from ear to ear.
the attack was so vicious, that both victims were nearly decapitated.
that didn't cause their death? / No.
the M. E. missed that they both also...
had fractures of the cervical spine.
their necks were broken.- Precisely.
Yes. The killer incapacitated each victim with a violent, and most likely fatal, twist of the head.
duck, I get the idea.
anyway, he slit their throats.
probably, to cover up the fact that he knew how to kill with his hands.
like a navy SEAL. / Yes.
which brings us back to petty officer Curtin.
I've said all along, - he's guilty. - Nothing in her cell phone records?
if she got that cell phone to call her boyfriend, then he's working at the video store, the grocery store, the hairdresser, the dry cleaner, or directory assistance.
she only got the phone when her husband shipped out.
what's the most frequently dialed number?
commander Foley's house.
Curtin's C. O?
only he was in Afghanistan with Curtin.
Mrs. Foley confirmed Margaret curtin called frequently, but it wasn't unusual.
all the wives did it.
the C. O.'s wife's the den mother when the unit's deployed.
it's a dead end, boss.
that cell phone log is the only record Curtin had that no one else did, and he got that just before he escaped.
whoever he is chasing isn't one of those numbers.
we just have to find out which one.
if she was cheating on her husband, do you think she'd tell the commander's wife?
not if she's anything like the den mother I had.
talk about bete noires.
you were a boy scout?
cub.
What'd they kick you out for?
trying to score brownie points.
Ooh, not the brunette in the little red number?
Yep.
she is absolutely nothing like my den mother.
you really should talk to my husband.
I barely knew petty officer Curtin.
we're actually more interested in what you know about his wife,
Margaret, Mrs. Foley.
according to her cell phone records, you two spoke regularly after your husband's deployment.
I kept in touch with all the wives.
it was a stressful time.
did Mrs. Curtin ever talk about a man that she might've become close to?
maybe even started seeing?
no. But Margie wouldn't confide in me about something like that.
What'd you talk about?
mostly about whether we heard any news or talked to anyone.
we were all desperate for information.
did Mrs. Curtin seem any more desperate than the rest of you?
or less?
I really don't know.
I was a wreck myself.
my husband got called to Washington immediately after the second plane hit the trade center.
said his team was being deployed.
he couldn't say where or for how long.
they don't waste their time, do they?
for the first six weeks, we didn't hear so much as a word.
after that, we got occasional phone calls, e-mails.
how long were they in Afghanistan?
the lucky ones, almost six months.
one came back after the first week.
bill made it through four and a half months before he got wounded.
wait.
your husband made it back almost a month before petty officer Curtin?
that's right.
do we have something linking Curtin's wife to commander Foley?
as in, biblically linking?
you got it.
no, I don't.
can you find it? - Sorry, Gibbs,
I left my ouija board at home.
is the magic in the board or in the hands that hold it?
good point.
but it's spirits, not magic.
fine. Have them call me when you find something.
okay.
be careful what you wish for.
commander Foley?
Yeah.
we'll drive.
sorry. - What do you got?
see, I figure...
how could I find evidence of an affair using only physical evidence collected at the crime scene.
and then I thought...
it's a blood test for herpes simplex two.
Curtin's wife had herpes?
and her husband didn't.
his medical records were admitted.
petty officer Curtin had an extensive physical done before he went overseas.
and I mean extensive. No herpes.
well, his wife could've gotten it before they got married.
Oh, the old, I-must've-gotten- it-before-we-met defense.
well, it can happen.
Really?
well, uh, not to me.
no, it, it didn't...
it hasn't happened. It, it won't happen.
didn't happen to her, either.
her medical records were admitted during trial.
her last physical was six months before she was murdered, when her husband was in Afghanistan.
no herpes.
all we need to do now is check commander Foley's records.
is there anything you can't find?
a way to shut up Dinozzo.
all right.
you agree to waive your Article 31 rights?
I've got nothing to hide.
I already told you, I haven't heard from him.
I don't expect to.
why not?
you testified on his behalf at the trial.
certainly seemed to be sympathetic to his situation.
his situation?
coming home and finding his wife in the bedroom with another guy.
well, wouldn't that bother you?
Oh, yeah, it bothered me a hell of lot, only I chose divorce over murder.
I didn't know that. - He's lying.
establishing rapport through shared communication.
are you sure he's lying?
of course I'm...not. - of course,
I was coming home from a three-month float in the med, not six months in a war zone.
wouldn't make a difference to me.
actually, it was more like four and a half months for you.
RPG broke your leg.
I was lucky. It killed petty officer Gomez.
you came home. Did you come home on crutches or a walking cast?
what does any of this have to do with petty officer Curtin?
it doesn't.
it has to do with his wife, and who really murdered her and the cable repairman.
you think I killed her?
did you?
what's taking you so long?
it's not like I can just google a navy SEAL commander and access his confidential medical records.
you think I'd frame a teammate?
a guy who would put his life on the line to save mine?
maybe you didn't mean to.
if Curtin hadn't come home exactly when he did, who knows what direction this case might've gone in.
Jack curtin was one of the most insanely jealous men I've ever met.
that's not what you said at his trial.
I didn't want to see him get executed.
sorry, uh, could I see you a second, boss?
Oh, I can't believe I'm seeing what I'm seeing.
never interrupt an interrogation, Mcgee.
never.
I'm, I'm sorry. I...
um, I, I just, I just thought...
to have a thought, Mcgee, you have to think.
were you thinking...
when you went into the interrogation room?
Yes, sir.
I, I think so.
well... okay.
what is so damn important?
Margaret curtin wasn't murdered by her jealous husband.
she was murdered by her jealous lover.
the same one that gave her herpes.
I'm not answering another question until I talk to a lawyer.
I want a lawyer, now.
hate to rain on your parade, but we still don't have Curtin.
at least he won't be able to kill commander Foley.
if we go public that we found his wife's killer, there's a good chance Curtain will turn himself in, if he's still alive.
it doesn't any make sense.
what? / Nothing. It's just...
doesn't make any sense. - You gonna give it up, Dinozzo?
or are you just gonna keep repeating yourself?
the calls from Curtin's wife to the Foley house pretty much stopped after Foley got back from Afghanistan.
yeah? So?
so, if they were having an affair, wouldn't the calls increase after he got back into town?
well, they didn't need to talk on the phone.
they could see each other in person.
why'd she stop talking to his wife?
well, maybe she couldn't.
would you be able to talk to the spouse of someone you were having an affair with?
I mean, would a normal person?
but she didn't completely stop.
McGee, did Foley spend any time in the hospital after he got back?
Yeah, he had, uh, surgery on his leg, and then again for a staph infection.
right. The surgery was on November 13.
back in for the infection on the 21 for...
one, two, three days.
Yeah, you're right.
how'd you know that? / Because those are the only days Curtin's wife made calls to Foley's house after he got back.
are you thinking what I think you're thinking?
I don't know, boss.
are you thinking what I think you're thinking?
Yeah. Her lover wasn't Foley.
it was his wife.
I think you have something of mine.
put your hands behind your head, interlock your fingers.
is this what you wanted your son to remember you for?
I'm not sure I'd even mind.
you wouldn't mind if your wife had an affair?
with another babe?
I don't think I would.
okay, I know I'm going to regret this, but... why?
easy. With a guy, I'd think, what has he got that I don't?
but if it was a woman, I'd know.
Plus, there's the whole... you know.
what?
you know...
Oh, please.
why are guys so interested in women, who by definition, have no interest in them?
there's no such thing.
there's no such thing as lesbians?
that's not what I said.
Oh, you just think all lesbians secretly still want a man?
not all of them.
just the good-looking ones?
you're putting words in my mouth.
welcome to the wonderful world of Dinozzo.
so I guess you're completely above such fantasies?
Yeah, I am.
believe it.
who's that?
that's a good question. Ask him.
just dropping off my glasses.
boss?
Yeah, Mcgee?
it was really nice working with you again.
same here, Mcgee.
uh, by the way, there's something that Tony and Kate have been meaning to ask you.
I mean, yeah, the new job starts a little too early, but, uh, the trade-off?
there's no cabs, no subways, no stress, quiet streets and actual wildlife.
hang on, I'm gonna text you a picture.
Oh! Oh, no!
morning bishop.
Oh! Morning, McGee, Tony.
what's up, Bish?
what do you got there?
just your basic bacon and egg.
you want some? - No.
uh, Tony and I are cleansing, remember?
right. What does that entail again?
one solid week of nothing but water with lemon, cayenne pepper, and a little bit of maple syrup.
and one very nice salad every day.
so this is some sort of... competition?
no. Uh, it's quite the opposite.
after McGee's recent emancipation from coupledom, he was talking about making a fresh start.
a clean break. Purging some toxins.
and so I thought I would offer to help him out.
stop. First off, no one is "emancipated."
delilah just happened to land a dream job halfway around the world.
and secondly, I seem to remember Tony wanting to kick-start the new year with a healthier new him.
but New Year's was months ago.
today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
actually, it's day two and I feel fantastic.
it's much easier with a buddy, isn't it?
Yeah, you bet, buddy!
then... you're okay if I eat this in front of you?
Absolutely.
you sure?
I mean, I... I can go elsewhere.
well, we're all going elsewhere.
dead Navy officer in Chesapeake.
in that case, nobody'll mind if I finish this in the car.
this is gonna be a long ride.
well, victim is Ensign Lester Tate, 23, currently assigned to the USS Soteria, home-ported a few miles from here in Norfolk.
what do you think, Duck?
mm, it was not that texting driver that killed the ensign.
but that damn fool should be stripped of both his phone and his car.
he already dead?
quite. These facial abrasions and...
bruised knuckles would indicate a spirited round of fisticuffs.
as usual, Jethro, we'll know more in autopsy.
Hey, how's that cleanse going, guys?
the what?!
nothing, boss.
Ah, yes, Mr. Palmer's been telling me about your joint endeavor.
it's the age-old pursuit, Jethro, of purifying one's system with a supplemented diet, or colonic irrigation, perhaps?
hmm. You guys doing that together, too?
keep shooting, probie.
do we have surveillance?
uh, none on this road, Gibbs.
you and Tony check the other roads, canvass the neighbors, see who saw the fight. McGee, come on, you're with me.
welcome aboard. How can I help you?
ensign, a word with your XO.
Oh. Good timing, sir.
commander Wexler? NCIS on board.
what can I do for NCIS today?
you have an officer in your command, an Ensign Lester Tate.
Oh, he's on leave till 0600 tomorrow, sir.
something wrong?
we're afraid he won't be reporting.
he was just found dead.
What?!
Oh, my God.
on a street in Chesapeake. Looked like he'd been in a fight.
is there anything you can tell us any conflicts or enemies?
none.
far as I know, everybody loved the guy.
what about Burke? Is he okay?
who's Burke? - Ensign Thomas Burke.
he and Tate are good friends.
they rented a crash pad in town for the week.
only, Burke...didn't report for quarters this morning.
I just marked him "unauthorized absence."
you have an address?
well, this is just a few blocks from where we found Tate's body.
no luck with neighbors, Gibbs, nobody saw a thing.
ensign Burke! NCIS! Open up!
okay.
get your hands on top of your head!
NCIS! - Don't move!
I didn't do it!
well, that's good to know.
poor Tate.
never should have left him.
you left him where?
the Silver Leaf. This, um...
this bar not far from here.
I cut out when he started ordering shots.
around midnight or so.
I just can't believe he's dead.
all right, why don't we forget last night.
let's talk about two minutes ago.
what about two minutes ago? Remember that time when we crashed through the doors and we had our guns and you went, "I didn't do it"!
you didn't do what, exactly?
you didn't know Tate was dead, Burke.
what didn't you do?
I...I, um... I, I'm drawing a blank.
I mean, you just startled me, that's all.
I don't know what I was saying.
you're gonna have to do better than that.
well, I can't. I mean, that's as good as I got. I...
you know, if you're gonna keep asking me, maybe I should have a lawyer present.
bedrooms are clear.
pretty gross, but clear.
DiNozzo, take Bishop with you and check out the bar. Burke...
you want a lawyer, call one.
tell them to meet you at NCIS.
say cheese.
Yeah, he was here last night, till about midnight or so.
his buddy stuck around a while after.
would this be his buddy?
that's him. Didn't realize he was Navy.
nice kid.
hated having to throw him out.
throw him out?
him and some other guy.
hell, he might have been Navy, too.
why'd you throw 'em out?
trading punches over some girl.
just before closing, around 2: 00.
some girl in here?
couldn't tell you. All I heard was a lot of "she"s and "her"s as they were throwing haymakers.
it was like a hockey fight.
did it, uh, did it continue outside?
couldn't tell you. My jurisdiction ends here.
you said the other guy you tossed out was Navy, too?
I said maybe. I get Navy people, dock workers, townies.
they all kind of blend in around here.
Mm. So no name or description?
I'm better with drinks than names.
kind of short, dark hair, 20s.
any other customers who saw the fight?
again, I'm better with drinks... Than names, yeah.
all right, you give me a call if you can think of anything else. Thanks.
you bet.
what do you got, Duck?
uh, Ensign Tate's blood alcohol level, 0.11.
not fall-down drunk, but drunk enough.
cause of death?
Ah, well, I've managed to narrow it down to blunt-force crush trauma to the squamosal suture.
Yeah, it's a vulnerable sweet spot where these plates meet.
not so sweet for Ensign Tate. - Indeed.
it's likely that the ensign's killer smashed his head against the pavement.
possibly repeatedly.
Yeah, I managed to pull some asphalt samples.
I was about to bring them up to Abby, see what they tell her.
well, have her tell me.
you know, it's funny.
you give your taste buds a breather, suddenly vegetables come a whole lot more tasty.
hilarious. We have a timeline yet?
mm, working on it.
we know Ensigns Lester Tate and Thomas Burke met at the Silver Leaf at about 2145.
Burke left at midnight. Tate and a mystery man were tossed out for fighting around 2: 00.
not much of a description, but we put a BOLO out just the same.
anything on Tate's cell phone?
Yeah, one short call last night between him and Ensign Burke at 21:15.
the old "meet me for a beer" call.
Yup. Before that, a few calls to his ship, a few more to Burke, and...
that's weird.
what's weird?
two days ago, Tate exchanged multiple calls from this number.
which number?
it's our number.
the NCIS information line.
hang on...
okay, it's not us.
calls went through our main line, but came out of our F-and-S-V unit.
family and Sexual Violence?
What'd they want with Tate?
well, we're about to find out.
special Agent Maureen Cabot,
I'm sure you and Agent Gibbs have crossed paths at some point.
at various agency functions we're forced to attend, yes.
you still driving that Chevy?
Yes.
as you know, the Navy is pushing harder than ever to eradicate sexual assault in their ranks.
was Ensign Tate a rape suspect?
right to the point, as always.
uh, no, Gibbs, um, Tate was a second-party complainant.
he reported an assault on behalf of a friend.
what friend?
a fellow junior officer now refusing to cooperate, Director.
denies it ever happened.
what made Tate think it did?
Tate came to us two days ago, saying his friend's behavior had changed in the last few weeks.
uh, distracted, short-tempered.
when he asked her about it, she admitted the assault and swore him to secrecy.
but he came to you anyway.
if only more like him did.
did he know the attacker?
no, and neither did the victim.
she claimed that she'd been drugged and unconscious during the attack.
so no suspects.
Oh, we've got suspects. She told Tate that the assaults occurred after a night drinking with him and several other junior officers during a port visit.
did Tate's roommate Burke know about the attack?
no, and his denials were quite vehement.
I didn't do it" and "It wasn't me,"over and over.
so, why is the victim denying it now?
take your pick, sir. Shame, fear, loss of peer status.
did she know that it was Tate who told you?
he's the only one she confided in, so she had a pretty good idea.
who is she?
special Agent Gibbs.
you need our XO again?
no.
I'm here to see you, Ensign Farrell.
me?
I'm sorry, Holly.
I told you, there was no assault.
it never happened.
ensign Tate said you confided in him.
why would he make that up?
you'd need to ask Ensign Tate.
it's a little late for that.
he was my friend.
I would never kill him or anyone else.
we were wondering if anyone else could have acted on your behalf.
what, like a hit man?
there anyone else who knows?
anyone else you confided in?
never. I mean, I would never tell anyone else that...
there was nothing to tell.
nothing happened.
God, I don't want to be doing this.
the only person you told is dead.
but that had nothing to do with me, right?
please tell me it had nothing to do with what I told him.
well, to do that, I would have to know what you said to him.
we had a port call in Key West last month.
the crew hit liberty like it was Spring Break.
I stuck with my brothers, as usual, my fellow J. O.'s.
how many?
uh, six, including Burke and Tate.
I can usually handle my margaritas, but halfway through my second,
I... I felt like I had chugged a whole bottle.
so I headed back to the ship early.
as the only female J. O. you had your own quarters?
next morning, I can't say I, uh... I woke up.
it was more like I... I came to.
I felt beaten up, like I'd been through a cement mixer.
at first, I was... I was so mortified.
I felt like I'd done something terrible.
so then I just...
hit the showers and pretended like it never happened.
next few weeks, I felt worthless...
paranoid...
I mean, even with my friends.
I, I had no idea who attacked me, so I couldn't help but wonder if maybe they did.
I swear it was...
it was like I was losing my mind.
until Tate asked what was wrong?
then the floodgates opened.
Tate was so sweet.
he wanted me to call the DoD Help Safeline, but I... I, I couldn't.
I made him promise he wouldn't either.
and that's when he came to us.
Hey, Gibbs.
Tony said that you wanted to...
to see me.
I'll be right back.
Abbs, how long do drugs stay in a person's system?
um, well, it depends on the drug.
a roofie of some kind.
Oh, no. Oh, God, that poor girl.
Abby, how long?
not long. 72 hours.
what are you doing?!
Holly, stop.
are you telling her about this?!
I was gonna have you drug-tested.
a drug test?
that would make sense, Holly.
if we can prove that you were drugged...
you can prove I'm not a liar?
no one thinks you're lying.
so now this woman knows about it.
and soon the entire Navy will know about it?
I would never tell a soul.
if we found a drug in you, Farrell, we might have traced it to whoever attacked you.
and catching him might have pointed to whoever killed your friend.
you can do that?
well, we'd have tried.
but Abby here tells me that any drug like that would've been out of your system by now.
but we still have you, Holly.
if you cooperate, we can go full bore after whoever attacked you.
no. I'm sorry.
have you seen the numbers on sexual assaults?
pretty bad.
Yeah, for all the talk about preventing it, condemning it, avoiding it, the numbers on it never seem to go down.
everybody knows somebody with a story to tell.
or not tell.
somebody what?
where are we on Tate's murder?
roommate's alibi cleared.
landlord saw Burke stumble home a solid hour before Tate's bar fight.
we got anything new on that?
well, if there is a rape involved, we have a new theory as to who Tate and our mystery man may have been fighting over.
bar's owner heard them say "she" and "her"as he was tossing them.
we now wonder if "she" is Ensign Farrell.
and if our mystery man also happens to be our rapist, he may have gone to the bar to shut Tate up.
Tony: And if he's on the crew of Tate's ship, then we can show the photos to the bartender, and mystery solved.
well, then why are you still here?
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
Yeah, Director.
I'm on my way.
Gibbs thinks Tate's killer could point us to Holly's attacker.
or they're one and the same.
or one case has nothing to do with the other.
one thing I do know: without Holly cooperating, the rape case is a lot harder to prove.
look, I... I hate to ask, but one bogus claim can cast doubt on a hundred legitimate ones.
so are we sure that there is something to prove?
you both spoke to her.
we're sure, Director.
I'm sure, Leon.
damn.
what?
well, just last week, my daughter tells me that...
...she would like to become a Navy officer someday.
just like thousands of women all around the country.
I want there to be no cases like this when they get there.
so there's really no convincing Farrell?
not until she's ready.
all she wants is to get back to her ship.
all right.
Oh, don't... don't get up.
I just wanted to come and check on you.
sorry I yelled before.
I'm usually a more trusting person.
Oh, you don't have anything to be sorry for.
and I just wanted to tell you that I don't have any firsthand experience what you went through, but nothing makes me sadder or madder or badder than even the thought of what was done to you.
and I really didn't mean to rhyme just now.
you summed it up nicely.
as far as trust goes, I want you to trust me when I tell you that you can trust Agent Gibbs.
like, a lot.
and I don't know Agent Cabot that well, but I know that her unit is-is busting their butt to try to stop what happened to you from ever happening to anyone else.
I mean, how is anything good and right supposed to make its way, if we don't help?
Oh, hey, Gibbs.
I wasn't trying to intrude.
I just wanted to check in on Holly before she goes.
is she still going?
can't make her stay.
come on, Holly, I'll drive you back to your ship.
don't be a stranger.
just take care of yourself.
wait.
I lied to you before.
you lied to me?
all of you.
including Tate.
what are you saying?
what really happened, Holly?
what haven't you told us, Farrell?
I didn't hit the showers first thing that morning.
I went to the NAS clinic and filed a restricted report in Key West.
d-did they run a rape kit?
Yeah. That's when it sunk in
the idea of everyone knowing.
I couldn't go any further.
that rape kit will still be in storage.
if you file an unrestricted report, we-we can have it sent here.
it might take a few days... N-No, it won't.
okay. I'll give a statement.
she'll get the kit.
is there any chance Tate fought with one of his shipmates?
no, none of them look familiar.
anyone here in the bar see the fight last night?
none that I see.
but give me a minute, I'll look through those again.
here you go. Oh, perfect.
thank you.
what's that?
Oh, sorry.
uh, the waitress came by while you were in the bathroom.
chili cheese fries? Are you serious?
well, I haven't eaten since lunch.
what are you talking about? You've been eating continuously.
you've had, like, nine or ten lunches since lunch.
I am not. It just seems that way because you're not eating at all.
you're diabolically cruel.
no, what's cruel is what you're doing to yourself.
I mean, I don't even know why you need to cleanse.
if McGee can do it, so can I.
Ah! So this is a competition, which is... crazy.
I mean, you both look... fine.
fine. See what I mean? - Yeah.
yeah-- good, fit, healthy...
...ish.
ish? Yeah.
like you guys have anything to worry about in the looks department.
give me a break.
well, when you put it like that...
Hey, fella.
you mind if I dance with your daughter?
get me some more water, please?
that's him.
this guy?
me? - No, not-not you.
him.
get out of here.
green shirt.
just walked in. That's the guy from last night.
he's so not Navy.
I said maybe.
I'll cover the door.
Hey, there, can I ask you a couple...
Hey! NCIS! Don't move!
stop! Hey!
well, you can't beat a well-placed Dumpster.
quite a hit parade here, Eddie.
armed robbery, drunk and disorderly...
doesn't mean I killed anybody.
then why'd you run?
I'm an ex-con. That's what we do.
so you don't have any friends in the Navy?
never been to Key West?
look, I know nothing about any girl on a boat.
then who were you fighting over?
some chick at the bar.
I was getting my grind on and she pretended not to like it, then suddenly Navy Boy gets in my face, saying it's creeps like me that make life worse for guys like him.
you believe that?
completely. Very much so.
so bing-bang-boom, we did our dance, and the bartender tosses us both and we go our separate ways.
you sure about that last part?
I flew one way, Navy Boy the other.
believe me, I wanted another crack at him, but my eye was cut.
that's why I went back to the bar last night looking for him.
why would I do that if I knew he was dead?
charming fellow.
not our killer.
no. He has nothing to do with our assault.
any word from Agent Cabot?
Farrell gave her a full statement.
now we just wait for the rape kit.
wait no more, Gibbs.
I mean, not for the kit 'cause that's still in transit.
but I was able to pull some strings with the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner in Key West.
I got the preliminary results.
negative for DNA. - Yeah.
it's not uncommon for attackers to wear a condom.
but look at the drug tests.
ketamine?
a horse tranquilizer?
special K.
the other date rape drug.
my God, what chance did she have?
she's got a better chance now.
...go and get this son of a bitch.
so this attack had nothing to do with Ensign Tate's murder?
GIBBS: We don't know yet, Captain.
case is under separate investigation.
we're here solely on Ensign Farrell's behalf.
zero tolerance is no slogan around here, Agents
it's a moral imperative. If that officer was harmed on this ship, we'll move heaven and earth to help you.
I only wish Farrell had said something at the time.
we could've done something about it.
we're doing something now.
we'll start by interviewing the four remaining J. O.'s who were with Farrell and Tate in Key West.
they're all yours. - Captain, there was also a sedative used in the attack, and, without probable cause, we can't search your ship ourselves, so...
understood. XO...
conduct a health and welfare inspection.
aye, sir.
fine with me if you want to tag along.
Yeah, sounds good.
just putting together a timeline, Ensign.
whatever you recall about that shore leave in Key West.
well, I-I know we all had fun.
just so stoked being back on dry land.
nothing but shipmates in every bar.
it's like we took over the town.
seemed to me like Holly was having a blast, like the rest of us.
did I see her leave the party?
I didn't see me leave the party.
me and Tate were calling her lightweight for leaving early.
we should've walked her back.
Yeah, pretty sure I saw Holly at breakfast.
nothing out of the ordinary.
Tate asked me, a few weeks later, if Holly seemed okay.
I mean, yeah, maybe she was a bit off, but only Tate would come out and ask her why.
when Agent Cabot brought you in about the assault, did you think that Tate had accused you?
no way. No, no, no.
Tate was my boy. He knew me better than that.
so you were... you were never mad at Tate.
no, sir.
I was mad at whoever did that to Holly.
that's why I called Tate to meet me at the bar.
I couldn't believe she didn't tell us. That girl was like our sister.
she always has our backs.
and if we'd known what happened, we'd have had her back, too.
once you got back to the ship that night, what was that like?
everybody messing around, playing jokes.
no idea what time it was.
well, hang on, I-I know what time it was. This...
app on my phone, it, uh, timestamps all my photos.
Yeah, here we are, for better or worse, for better or worse, back in our bunksat 0332.
all together.
any pictures of Holly that night?
uh, sure, I must have a few.
at least, I think so.
she did cut out early, so...
Yeah, here's one.
a nice group shot.
keep your chinny chin up, McGee. We'll talk to you soon.
all right, search of the ship produced a dozen Cuban cigars, some bootleg DVDs and one...stowaway ferret.
but no ketamine. Apparently Gibbs' interviews didn't go much better.
then there's our case.
Oh, yeah...
we're in great shape.
don't say it, Miss Chili Cheese.
Ah, just the agents for whom I was looking.
how are you, Ducky?
better, thank you, Eleanor; now that I have ascertained a more definitive cause of death for Ensign Tate.
your prelim said it was blunt force to the Quasimodo something.
the squamosal suture was in fact the culprit, Tony, but death was far from instantaneous.
the ensign suffered an epidural hematoma.
like a slow bleed? Yeah, slow enough that he may well have been able to walk a fair distance before finally succumbing to his injury.
walked?
like, from the bar?
what punch could land hard enough to cause an epidural hematoma to the squamosal suture?
Show-off.- Hey, guys, um, Abby's tied up, you know, on the... on the other case, but she wanted me to show this to both of you.
has to do with that asphalt that we pulled from Ensign Tate's head wound.
what about it?
well, aside from the...
usual bituminous sand and tar, she also found trace elements of vegetable oil.
vegetable oil...
you know, like old, burnt vegetable oil with microscopic bits of potato, bread, onion...
like from a deep fryer. - Exactly.
but I don't remember any fast food joints near there...
no, but apparently they do.
listen, uh, I-I kind of hate to ask, but is there any kind of reward for helping you catch this guy?
we'll get to that, Fred.
but first we need to clear up a few more details.
so, you dragged both men out here and sent them in separate directions?
Yeah, I pushed one guy that way.
which guy? Ensign Tate?
no, your bad guy.
the Navy guy I pushed that way, toward the street.
Ah, towards the street and this not-very-well-placed and quite greasy Dumpster.
Yeah, I been meaning to clean that.
any chance Tate could have hit the Dumpster when you pushed him?
I guess. It's right there. Why?
because our "bad guy," as you call him...
he's not our killer.
okay.
so no reward?
uh, a very delicate spot on Tate's skull hit something hard, heavy and... well, greasy.
it caused his brain to bleed and... - Wait...
are you saying I killed him?
well, you obviously didn't mean to.
no, no, i-it all happened so fast.
all I did was push.
we know that.
Oh, my God, what did... what did I do?
he... he was just a kid.
Oh, my God, what did I do?
so Tate defends a girl's honor and ends up getting thrown on his head?
more or less. Accidental.
and it had nothing to do with what happened with me.
nothing beyond Tate trying to do the right thing, both times.
that's him all the way.
think that's why I told him, hoping deep down, he'd tell you about it so I didn't have to.
I was just filling Holly in on our interviews.
how could I ever doubt those guys?
like they'd ever be capable.
a long way from perfect but they're my brothers and I turned on them.
no. No, someone turned on you. And we will find him, Holly, even if it means talking to every last man and woman on that ship.
I'm not saying I don't want you to talk to the whole ship.
I'm just saying that once you do, I'm not sure I can go back on that ship.
or any ship.
don't quit.
I don't want to quit, sir.
but I also don't want people looking at me differently and whispering behind my back.
that's something I don't think I can live with.
we got something.
tell 'em, McGee. - Well, it was a long shot, boss, but I got so frustrated when the ship search came up empty, I ran a cross-check between Navy personnel and ketamine use.
and he got a hit.
a civilian medical clinic in San Diego treated a Navy officer stationed there three years ago.
lieutenant Monica King.
she came in with a separated shoulder, but the doctors found ketamine in her system.
why wasn't she treated on base?
well, that's a question for her, except she left the Navy two months later.
anyone on the Soteria stationed in San Diego three years ago?
no. It's the first thing I checked.
but if we can find Monica King, maybe she knows who drugged her.
and who drugged Holly, too.
come on. Let's go.
let's find her.
appreciate your time, Ms. King.
I see you're having some rough weather there.
Aw, it's just a little rain, sir.
and it's "Monica.
but no need for small talk. Agent on the phone mentioned my tour in San Diego?
uh, more specifically, Monica, a local clinic that you visited there for a shoulder injury.
and a drug test.
we don't mean to blindside you.
you didn't.
I had a feeling.
just, uh...
just kind of hard to believe somebody over there finally wants to hear about this.
it's however you want to tell us.
well, uh...
the USS Panther was in port, and...
like always, a few coworkers and I hit the Officers' Club just to say hi and have a drink with some of their people.
and, uh... I had just started on...
my second glass of wine when my eyes got real, real heavy.
I-I barely remember getting back to my apartment across from base before I-I just passed out.
and the, and the rest is kind of sketchy.
just dark flashes and...
a weight on me.
my arm was twisted real, real hard behind me...
and, uh...
do you really need to hear about this?
did you know who it was?
never saw him.
you know, I waited a day to tell my XO.
stupid. He said without a name, what did I expect him to do?
no. ROTC...
three years active duty, all my dreams just over in one night.
what's that XO's name?
I hear he's a captain now.
old-school, untrained, insensitive...
there's no Rundy on Farrell's ship.
I'll find him.
boss, I'm not finding anyone named Rundy on the USS Panther.
no, no, no, Rundy was Monica's base commander.
we need to cross-check the Soteria's crew now with the Panther's crew from three years ago.
got it. Anyone that served on both ships.
it's late.
it is not too late.
Oh, it's not too late at all.
who?
this is nuts.
sit down.
Really?
what, was I not helpful enough for you?
no.
no, you were very helpful.
let you search my ship, question my guys.
on what, the word of one girl?
who's great and all, but, come on, a whole month and a half later?
do you know this woman?
you met her three years ago in San Diego, when your previous ship, the Panther, was moored there.
no.
I was on the Panther, but I never laid eyes on this girl.
she wasn't a girl, Wexler, and neither is Holly Farrell.
they were both Navy officers when you laid a lot more than eyes on 'em.
Hey, back off.
I put in 15 years in seven different commands.
I've worked with hundreds of female J. O.'s.
you think these two somehow turned my head?
we looked into those seven commands, Wexler, and we found a total of nine female subordinates that were assaulted in the same way.
a good XO stays on top of his crew on liberty.
he pops into the bars they hit.
maybe buys 'em a round of drinks.
if you even suggest that I'm a rapist, which I am not, it'll kill my career.
I don't recognize any of these women.
because they're not unconscious?
you son of a bitch...
you've been saving that one, Mo.
you have no idea.
today is a much better day.
understatement of the year there, Bish-op.
just met with Fred the bartender's lawyer.
he thinks the charge will be reduced to involuntary manslaughter.
Yeah. Sure beats the alternative.
right?
you must be feeling good, Mr. Purple Shirt.
without your mad computer skills, there would still be a predator on the loose.
Yeah. Yeah, it feels good.
what is it?
nothing.
Tony, I'm sorry.
how long?
just this once?
okay, it's been the whole time. But we...
we've been working late. I was weak.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
wait, please, I have another one-- here.
take it. It's yours.
you can't buy me with your pepperoni.
I want a steak.
and creamed spinach.
and French fries. Mmm.
can I get in on this?
Yes. Absolutely.
steaks all around. My treat. Let's go.
okay.
it's hard to wrap my head around.
I mean, the guy never came across as a Boy Scout or anything, but neither do half my friends.
hard to know some people.
Yeah, especially somebody like him. Ugh.
and Cabot really cracked him?
okay...
I'm really antiviolence, but it was awesome.
I wish you could've seen it. - Yeah, me, too.
but I'll get my shots in at his court-martial.
where are you heading?
shipmates are having a little memorial for Tate before he's sent back to his family up in Syracuse.
there'll be a lot of talk about Wexler and what happened to you.
you ready for that?
guess I'll just have to be.
do you need... some company or anything?
no. I have a ride coming.
thanks for offering, Abby.
and, you know, for everything.
she was right about you.
Oh, well, she's right about a lot of things.
Hey, Hol.
ready?
she just stole your move.
that was totally a...
patented Gibbs head slap right there.
you spend so much time sucking up to Americans...
by all means, you should be comfortable.
there is a word for you in English-- scum.
scum supporting terror with finance, intelligence, weapons...
although, intelligence may not be the right English word,
since you have lost so many treasured clients in recent years.
like this one.
but he was more than a client, yes?
you considered him your friend.
I have many friends, Anton.
Ari's death left you with, how shall I say, an unhealthy interest in American agency NCIS.
and now my sources tell me that an employee of theirs is here, in Moscow.
you and your people have been following him.
I know nothing about that.
stay away from NCIS.
calm yourself, counselor.
I wouldn't dream of implicating Mother Russia.
my interests will remain personal.
deeply personal.
I'm sure you've seen him around the office, Gibbs.
Kevin Hussein, our systems administrator?
could be nothing.
he took leave without pay this week to visit a sick uncle in Moscow.
uncle apparently died yesterday, and while he was making arrangements to ship his body back here for burial, Kevin got the feeling he was being watched, followed.
well, yeah, Leon. It is Russia.
russia says it's not them.
either way, he got spooked, took refuge at our embassy in Moscow.
now he needs safe passage home.
what, someone can't just put him on a plane?
kid's a walking database of naval technology, Gibbs, a very attractive target for our enemies.
so, the embassy contacted SECNAV, and SECNAV has requested you to be his escort.
me.
like I said, could be nothing.
I. T. Kevin, the computer geek?
he does comedy improv, sweet guy.
Yeah, I don't know about the comedy, but, uh, his improve skills definitely helped put away the world's number one cyber terrorist.
yet, you still call him a geek.
Yes.
once a geek, always a geek.
so, uh, what's going on in Moscow, boss?
think he's got an uncle that teaches at one of the universities there.
thank you, boss.
boss?
long story, but one of you are coming.
I don't know if I can go.
uh, jet lag from that trip to Spain is still haunting me.
well, I did just get back from Dubai.
Yeah, I might have popped a rib running with those bulls.
Plus, I'm tremendously out of shape.
all Delilah and I did was eat and sleep and eat and, well, other things.
fear not, weary travelers.
after an entire summer spent house-hunting with Jake, to no avail,
I would be thrilled to go just about anywhere, Gibbs.
Nope, Defense Attach?? only gave clearance to senior agents.
never ask for the job.
right.
well, you know Kevin very well.
he helped you put away Ajay Khan.
Ah, yes, he did.
rock, paper, scissors.
Yeah. - Damn!
good job, McPaper.
Dasvidaniya.
in here, sir. - Thank you.
Oh, man, am I glad to see you.
whoa, Kevin. You okay?
much better now.
you have no idea the last three days that I...
Oh, my God. Agent Gibbs.
wow, they sent the A-team.
not that you're not A-team enough, Tim.
but Agent Gibbs-- I didn't mean to make extra work for you, sir.
I really didn't.
breathe, Kev. Deep breaths.
and I swear I am not being paranoid.
pretty sure I was being followed the minute I got here.
completely sure. Positively.
you brought a Navy helicopter?
you expected a hot-air balloon?
I didn't know what to expect.
how'd you sneak it past the Russians?
diplomatic courtesy.
and a couple of ace pilots.
lieutenant Commander Banks, Lieutenant Hagen, say hi to Kevin.
welcome aboard.
sorry we're hitting a little bit of rough air.
it's no problem, ma'am.
miss.
we're going out the same way we came in.
north over the Kola Peninsula to the Barents Sea.
from there, you'll take a COD to the UK, then a C-40 Clipper home.
enjoy the in-flight movie, gentlemen.
there's a, there's a movie?
...this is Echo-Bravo-Nine. We're airborne and in route.
it's, uh... it's my first helicopter ride.
you'd never know.
jerky?
no, thanks. I'll be fine.
so, your uncle... what-what was it?
cancer?
lung. Stage three.
thought he was on the upswing, but, uh...
well, at least you got to send him home.
not the way I wanted.
what the hell?
radar tracking, 2:00.
warrior, this is Echo-Bravo-Nine.
we have been targeted by a surface-to-air missile.
hang on back there.
execute evasive maneuvers!
coming up on our right.
breaking left.
we've been hit. - Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
this is Echo-Bravo-Nine.
position 6-7-3-3, decimal...
everybody brace for impact.
losing aft hydraulics.
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday...!
warrior, this is Echo-Bravo-Nine.
we have been targeted by a surface-to-air missile.
hang on back there.
coming up on our right.
breaking left.
we've been hit. - Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
this is Echo-Bravo-Nine, position 6-7-3-3, decimal...
and that was the last transmission.
01:00 Zulu.
that's 12 minutes ago.
and no transponder?
we've yet to pick up a distress beacon.
I'll make some calls.
surface-to-air missile?
nothing we saw coming.
stream us a copy of that last Mayday transmission, commander.
and get me the Russian embassy.
Joe... you okay?
Hagan, talk to me.
banks. Hold on, Banks.
talk to me... - I can get you out.
don't move.
I'm fine. I'm fine. Check on Joe.
Where's Evans?
let's not worry about that right now.
let's take care of you.
boss...
it's okay.
Kevin! - Pressure on it.
Kevin? - Right here.
Oh, man. I don't believe this.
somebody find me the first aid kit.
we left our go-bags on the ship, boss.
what the hell happened?
Kevin, get me the kit.
they're dead, aren't they?
Joe, Evans...
I found it. Found a kit.
here.
go on, help Mcgee. Go find some water.
Yes, Director Vance.
my office did just receive word of a possible downed aircraft somewhere over the Kola Peninsula.
I was not aware that it may have been one of yours.
it is ours, Mr. Pavlenko.
they were shot down, we have the Mayday call.
target of a surface-to-air missile.
if that is true, I assure you my government had absolutely nothing to do with it.
then who?
every nation has its outlaws.
if there is, uh, a mercenary group operating in that region,
I assure you, they will be found, and brought to justice.
none of which helps us right now.
with all due respect, counselor, where are your bosses on this?
my superiors will be receiving updates, Salgent.
as for right now, Director-- while there is some very dense forest in that area,
I will request immediately that search plans are dispatched for recovery.
not recovery... rescue.
of course.
if there are survivors, I can assure you, help is on its way.
so, please, as you might say, gentlemen, sit tight.
sit tight?
just hung up with NSA.
they're combing the airwaves.
if that helo puts out a signal, someone will hear it.
he really just say, sit tight??
nobody's sitting tight. Let's move.
warrior, this is Echo-Bravo-Nine. Warrior...
we can forget about cell reception.
there's a circuit breaker under the manifold you can try restarting.
I see it, Commander. Thank you.
we've already tried that.
then try again.
our coordinates before we got hit are in there.
finland's just west, about 20 klicks or so.
well, the radio's a goner.
but I think that I can hook the transponder up to the battery, and if I can do that without frying it, we should able to get something out there.
Wait--out there?? like a signal?
wouldn't that signal whoever it was that shot us down?
who did shoot us down, Kevin?
what?
how should I know?
they were following you.
they wanted something from you.
I swear, Gibbs, I don't know.
not who they are or what they want.
listen.
that's them.
coming to finish the job.
we have to get out of here, please.
Kevin, breathe.
hey... hey... it's okay. He's right. Go.
Nah. We're not going anywhere.
we've been hit! - Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
this is Echo-Bravo-Nine. Position 6-7-3-3, decimal...
don't torture yourself, Abby.
I just keep thinking I'll find something, Jimmy.
something that will help them.
somehow.
it's a damn needle in a haystack.
kola Peninsula is the size of Kentucky.
their flight pattern north to the carrier was right along Finland's border.
Yeah, spanning 400 kilometers.
250 miles. - All right, let me know.
still no distress signal, but I'm pulling some strings with the NSA to get us some deeper access.
well, let's leave no string unpulled.
finland's an ally. Why don't we... launch a search party from over there?
russia would never allow it.
but we've put Finland on alert.
for diplomatic reasons, SECNAV says we have to give the Russians first crack at search and rescue.
so our friends are out there, and they're worried about saving face?
they should start by reeling in those jokers running around with surface-to-air launchers.
the missile.
what?
I don't know.
excuse me, Director... has anyone told Kevin's family yet?
I'm sure whoever's expecting to pick up his uncle's body from Moscow would surely want to know about this.
family notifications are your wheelhouse, Doctor. Would you mind?
my kingdom for a smaller wheelhouse.
how much should I tell them?
just that he's missing.
every effort's being made. No specifics.
that's hardly a challenge.
all we seem to have are unknowns.
it's quite an accident, my dear.
the passengers.
where are Hussein and the special agents?
I don't know.
thrown in the crash.
the truth could save your life.
let the liar bleed to death.
flashlight.
you... beautiful...
...not so clever.
you hear that?
that's the missile hitting the helo's tail.
how can we not hear it? Can you turn that down?
I was able to isolate the sound from the Mayday call.
that's great, Abbs. But are you okay?
me?
no. No, not at all.
two of the most important people in our lives just got shot out of the sky, and until I can figure out how to help them,
I-I don't... I'm just... I'm gonna lose it.
well, we're right there with you, Abby.
but if one of us loses it, we all lose it, including Gibbs and McGee.
well, I,um... I'm not gonna actually lose it,
I just... I mean, what do we do, if Gibbs and McGee...?
Abby... do you know that the odds of surviving a helicopter crash are surprisingly high.
statistically, much higher than a plane crash.
like two out of three.
Really?
so, I'm just... I'm not going there, okay?
I refuse to think the worst.
and I refuse to listen to that missile hit the helicopter again. How about you?
I won't. I had to. So I could identify the missile.
you what?
well, not me, but my friend Augie, he's a Marine anti-aircraft gunner, and he's stationed in Kuwait.
if anyone knows what that sound is, he does.
you played it for him?
Yeah, over the phone.
he immediately identified it as...
a 9K-32 STRELA-2 portable surface-to-air missile.
that's... that's amazing.
amazing and...
and it turns out that a huge cache of STRELA-2s were stolen from a Libyan stockpile two years ago.
the suspects were mercenaries that were funded by Russian oligarchs.
very bad guys.
okay. Names and faces.
I'm working on it.
and I'm not gonna lose it, I promise.
what are you looking for?
I no find. I go.
you die slow.
is bad.
you are... beautiful.
I like.
I've seen dead people before, but never actually anyone killed.
you want to see another one?
no, not really.
what do you have, Kevin? And don't say nothing.
he was looking for something.
what is it?
boss.
she's not looking good.
Ah, Banks... hang on.
my team is frustrated, Madame Secretary.
and I can't say that I blame them.
Yes, I know, but...
of course. Yes, I'll keep you posted.
a truly surreal day, Director.
why do I have the feeling that you're not about to make it better?
only more bizarre, I'm afraid.
it seems the only remaining family of young Mr. Hussein is a sister in Buffalo, who knew nothing about his current trip to Moscow.
and the uncle?
Edgar Hussein had indeed been fighting lung cancer, but Kevin's sister had no idea that he'd passed away.
in fact, it was her belief that he had gone into remission.
so... so what are we saying?
well, I took the liberty of calling our embassy in Moscow.
they confirmed shipment of the remains yesterday, sent by Kevin, to a funeral home not far from his apartment in Fairfax.
get that body over here, Doctor.
uh, I already took that liberty, as well.
the body arrives at Dulles shortly.
Mr. Palmer is on his way to get it.
and I, frankly, cannot wait to see it.
banks! Talk to me, Banks.
where you from, Hannah?
what hometown?
I tried to steer clear, Gibbs.
I couldn't shake it.
Hey, you are one hell of a pilot.
my mom will want these.
no... no... no, you give those to her yourself.
Hannah, stay with me.
you stay with me.
Hannah, tell me about your dad.
Where's your dad?
right there.
help me get her inside.
Yuri.
Oh, man, are you kidding me?
Kevin, shut up.
look, I feel terrible.
but if nobody answers that, then they're coming back.
and real soon.
all right. Gear up.
so, Finland, right?
20 klicks, she said.
kilometers, that's about, uh, 12 miles?
it's 12 hard miles.
I ran a mini marathon last year. Don't worry about me.
now, boss, if we get to higher ground,
I may be able to send out a signal or even a call for help.
higher ground it is.
is that the uncle?
Yes, Edgar Hussein.
61, visiting professor at the Moscow Engineering Institute.
I think we can rule out cancer.
two bullet wounds?
a detail Kevin somehow neglected to tell the U. S. Embassy.
which would clearly implicate him as the possible killer.
Oh, come on.
Kevin? I can't see him doing this. And why would he ship the body home?
it'd pretty much guarantee him not getting away with it.
unless he named himself as the only one authorized to receive the body.
we need answers, Doctor.
well, if Uncle Edgar can provide them, you shall have them.
I'll start on the X-rays.
thought that only worked in movies.
and it's dead-on accurate.
uh, Boy Scout motto, boss: always be prepared.
sorry, I didn't realize I had it until you were halfway done, and by then, I-I was just curious to see it work.
20 klicks, McGee, huh?
minus two or three? - At least.
I'd say we probably got another... 17 to go.
what?
17. Let's do it.
save your water.
right.
and, again, Agent Gibbs, that leaf thing, very cool.
for something so small, it practically leapt off the screen.
you can see the two bullets in the chest cavity here and here, but this...
that's no bullet.
well, whatever it is, Director, it's only an inch deep.
some kind of micro SD card?
Yes, it appears that Kevin's uncle was murdered and used as a mule.
for whatever's stored in that thing. Let's get that to Ms. Sciuto.
quick breather, boss?
Dubai... Told you I'm out of shape.
go ahead.
can I get a sip of yours?
no. Not you, Agent Gibbs. I was asking McGee.
and I asked you something back there, and I'm done waiting for an answer.
you're not getting any water until we get one.
first visiting my uncle was a few months ago.
I was approached by this guy, Sergei.
which may not even be his real name, but he offered very serious money for this thing that he needed.
what thing?
it's kind of a weapon.
I only agreed so I could help my uncle with his medical costs.
but when I came to deliver this week, my conscience got the better of me.
so you backed out of the deal.
I tried to.
but when I got to my uncle's place, he'd been shot to death.
the man was like a father to me, and I got him killed.
all I could think to do was to not make it worse by giving in to Sergei.
Where's the weapon now?
with my uncle. In my uncle.
just how small a weapon is it?
it's a... microdisk. Computer virus.
Sergei wanted to use it on defense systems, which would be very bad, especially since I'm kind of the only one that can deactivate it.
kind of?
it's a prototype.
a few more months of testing wouldn't hurt.
but that's not a problem now, guys.
my uncle's body should be home soon, and no one can get to it but me.
long as no one plugs in that microdisk, there's no danger.
no danger?
what, are you delusional?
think about who you've been working with the last few years.
they'll get the body.
and Abby will get the microdisk.
partial print is Kevin's, and the blood damage is minimal.
but, considering where you found this baby, there's no way I'm just gonna jam it into our network.
which would explain the purpose of this contraption.
the laptop isolates the SD card and the cage isolates the laptop from the rest of our network...
okay, time's kind of a factor here, Abbs.
I'd go with the cat.
Yeah, most of us would but... WMD.
what Would McGee Do?
that's two Ws, Abbs.
whatever.
if there's one thing that McGee has taught me, it's to never click on an unfamiliar icon that's telling you to click on it.
the old shark and the kitty? Head fake?
Yeah, but what if it's a double fake?
like trying to get me ck on the shark.
what would McGee do, Ms. Sciuto?
McGee would put up a virus scanner and build a firewall.
okay... Here, kitty, kitty.
should have gone with the shark.
what's happening?
what about the firewall?
it ate right through it.
a-and then it bypassed the cage through the power cord.
whatever can do this, I am gonna need help to stop it.
and fast.
let's go.
McGee, where are you?
do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?
no. Keep your eyes open.
Oh, boss, I got a signal.
these damn things won't let me shut them down.
it's even messing with our phones.
got every available I. T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.
we know one I. T. who does. Or did.
whoever it is, not now.
Tony, wait, it's me.
McGee. Is Gibbs with you?
Yeah. It's, uh, myself, Gibbs and Kevin.
our two pilots and a crewman are dead.
DiNozzo, if anyone there finds a computer disk, do not open it.
repeat, do not access the disk.
well, we would need a time machine, boss.
unfortunately, it's a computer Armageddon around here.
does Kevin know any quick fixes?
not quick, that's for sure. I could try working something out.
do it.
stand by on that, Leon.
sitrep.
are you in danger?
affirmative, sir.
shot down and being pursued.
we're headed towards Finland.
do you know your coordinates?
just where we went down.
uh, latitude: North 67, 33. 6.
Longitude: East 30, 46. 6.
get down!
Oh, my God.
I'm hit. I can't believe I'm hit.
that's a deep gash. Through and through.
through and through? Is that bad?
hold this. Press down on this.
so which NCIS man killed our Yuri?
no one else needs to die.
just give up the traitor and walk away.
traitor?
he means me.
please... No one is leaving you.
get ready to run.
all right?
go!
come on.
okay, whatever phone they were on is dead. And ours aren't much better.
doesn't matter-- they're alive, we have the coordinates, we know where they are.
jet's fueled and ready, Dinozzo. Get on it.
I am on it.
guys, there's a path back there.
we know.
then why are we stopping?
I know it's getting dark, but it's, what, like, another three miles?
we won't make three miles with you slowing us down.
we're not carrying you.
or freezing to death.
sit down, Kevin.
some fire.
I'd worry about giving up our position, but...
looks like there's no, uh, danger of that.
boy Scout motto, McGee.
carry a lighter.
okay, fine, so we're warm.
but Sergei's still coming.
solve one problem at a time.
what do you mean?
what problem?
can't go any further until you stop bleeding.
all right, bite down on this.
all right, done.
me, too.
what are you doing?
Gibbs... there's no way they won't see that.
well, that would be the plan.
delivery.
Thanks.
anything else we can do?
I really wish there was, Director.
it's Jake.
uh, Jimmy, take over from here.
Hey, Jake.
all right, I'm-I'm saying it now.
now, okay, on three.
one... two... now.
looks better already.
for the moment.
I've just got to come up with some more red meat.
well, keep at it.
and if you can think of anything else that you need.
I need... Gibbs and McGee to come back alive.
don't stop. Keep moving.
what have you got, Bishop?
access, Director.
well, hasn't your computer been corrupted?
Oh, I'm on NSA's network, Ducky, not ours.
my husband patched me in and MTAC routed our request for an infrared GPS satellite feed through DOD.
and, wow, okay, there it is.
here are the coordinates where the helo was hit.
where it landed is anyone's guess.
close enough.
can you pan west?
what was that?
can you zoom in?
got to be a fire of some kind.
pan slowly between whatever it is Got to be a fire and Finland's border.
there.
could that be them?
they're moving pretty fast on foot.
like they're being chased.
or chasing those three.
that's got to be our guys.
tightly configured-- as though those two are assisting the third.
you think we're stopped?
we never stop.
and you will never leave.
what is this guy, the Terminator?
turn it off, Tim.
wait... why are we stopping?
take him, Tim, keep going.
no, boss... boss, we're not leaving you.
I'm with Tim.
we've come this far.
we're not gonna get any farther unless someone slows 'em down.
I'll stay.
McGee... - Boss.
I'll be right behind you.
go on.
get out of here.
keep going.
Who-Who's that splitting off?
Oh, dear.
you made this too difficult, Agent Gibbs.
boss, get in the truck.
Hey, we're 100 yards from the Russian border, we got to go.
not without the helo crew.
gotta go; Kremlin says they'll get 'em home.
finns want to get back across the border.
let's move.
another boat?
you planning another trip?
not anytime soon.
ms. Sciuto will be weeks cleaning up the damage from the virus.
Kevin, he was helpful, but he's still looking at serious time.
well, I will bet you didn't come all the way down here to just tell me that, Leon.
look familiar?
international mercenary.
funded by oligarchs.
long list of offenses.
Yeah. Well, the only one that matters is he killed two pilots and a petty officer.
not if you consider his friendship with Ari Haswari.
seems his deal with Kevin may have just been a plan to get back at us.
his plan backfired.
no, Gibbs.
our Intel says Sergei survived.
what?
how?
I hit him.
he went down.
he got up.
no body was recovered.
and wherever he is now, knowing all this, there's a good chance he'll be gunning for us.
not if we find him first.
so when you say you're sure,
Yeah, but what if you're wrong?
J. B.trust me, the girl's into you.
Hey, careful!
Ah, relax.
this guy's a Marine.
before he deployed himself through his windshield.
so what do I say to her?
I don't know. What do I look like, the Cyrano de what's-his-face guy?
go with your gut.
you got the release?
no, didn't you get it?
you know what? On second thought, maybe you better not go with your gut.
so where should I take her?
I'm gonna start charging you or advice, you know?
Oh, there she is.
you smell that?
gas.
Oh, no.
get out.
get out, get out, get out!
go, go, go!
what are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a very serious negotiation.
on McGee's computer?
I know where you're going with this.
and the answer is yes.
and what's the question?
have I no shame?
who are you IMing?
agent Larson?
and she thinks you're MGee?
and this is because she warned you that if you spoke to her again, she would have you brought up on sexual harassment charges.
that was a misunderstanding.
Oh, so now you're correcting the record.
I'm just trying to let her know that I...
McGee feels that she may have misjudged me, and...
thats a close, personal friend, I can...
vouch for Tony'sth strength of character.
I don't have much time.
she's being reassigned in two days.
Yeah, well, you'll be reassigned if Gibbs catches you.
doing what?
uh, we were looking at McGee's bookmarks, trying to get an idea for a...
birthday present.
morning.
happy birthday, Probie.
it's a bagel.
um, not my birthday.
grab your gear.
medical transport just exploded.
any day now, Probie.
Yep, sorry.
I just got the strangest IM.
she asked you out?
you?
trust me, I'm just as surprised as you are.
trust me, you're not.
blast radius indicates a low-yield detonation.
she say why?
uh...
it said that she liked the loyalty I showed my coworkers.
pyrolysis on the pavement suggests O2 was the primary accelerant.
even if they were total scum.
no idea what she was referring to.
I'll tell you, though, did not realize she was paying so much attention to me.
you want to tell the Probie or should I?
how about neither?
why don't you just focus on the work?
Yeah, I've noticed you've morphed into quite the forensic expert.
I'm Israeli.
this isn't my first exploding ambulance.
we left the van unattended for four, maybe five minutes tops.
as soon as Patto hit the brakes...
the whole thing exploded into fjames.
I think someone's trying to kill us.
would you please stop that, J.B?
it was, it was an accident.
who's trying to kill you?
who knows?
there's a lot of weirdoes out there.
tell me about it.
talk to me, Duck.
lance Corporal William Danforth, Jr.
survived IEDs in Iraq,
RPGs in Afghanistan.
Unfortunately,the local Odocoileus virginianus was too much to bear.
that's a white-tailed... -Deer.
Yeah, I know.
you saying Bambi killed this Marine, Ducky?
no.
but swerving at 60 miles an hour into a tree to avoid Bambi did.
his girlfriend is still in a coma at the hospital.
Danforth w DOA when they brought him in last night.
this morning, he was on his way to Bethesda for a routine autopsy -when fate intervened. -Fate?
the scorching of the body is consistent with a gasoline fire accelerated by onboard oxygen.
this could have been an accident, Jethro.
lucky for those two to get out.
Yeah. Lucky in a way I don't like.
good morning, good morning
morning.
good...
good morning to you You, you, you Good...
Ooh, what's that?
looks like an iPod.
ipod photo.
anyone who might have possibly had a motive to try to kill them...
either has an alibi or is out of town.
way ahead of you.
you could have told me and saved me the trouble.
just say you need the practice and leave it at that.
what kind of music does the McGee listen to?
Ooh, Barry Manilow?
let's go to photos.
what are you doing?
well, McGee had a date with Agent Larson last night.
didn't return any of my e-mails about a sit-rep.
maybe he took some photos.
those are his private photos.
well, he left them on his public desk.
Where's the clicker?
who is this?
well, it's definitely not Agent Larson.
got to be his sister. -Why?
you kidding?
this girl's way out of McGeek's league.
I don't think the drivers were the target, Tony.
I actually think it was the body.
why blow up a dead guy?
put it back up there.
put what back?
McGee's got good taste.
going for coffee.
what was that for?!
alerting DiNozzo.
the fuel line to the gas tank cap is ruptured here
torn by a loose bolt on the differential housing.
loosened how? -Unknown.
the van also had a short in the electrical system, coincidentally, in the taillight right by our ruptured fuel line.
you know how I feel about coincidences, Abs.
equatorial pygmies know how you feel about coincidences, Gibbs.
so one would wonder:
accident or not an accident?
that is the question.
our first player:
an innocent differential housing bolt that is rubbing and straining on the molecular bonds of our vulcanized fuel line, until, after eons, our hapless hose finally ruptures.
the gas moves quickly into the floorboard of the van when it's in motion.
the driver smells it.
what could it be?
he hits the brakes, and the short in the taillight ignites the pooling gas vapors.
the flames quickly superheat the onboard O2.
and when the canisters can no longer contain the growing pressure, -kaboom! -Not an accident.
not unless the Angel of Death is going through a Rube Goldberg stage.
boss, we found remnants of what may have been the trigger on an O2 canister.
may have been, McGee?
there were traces of mercury fulminate, sodium azide and tryl on the material.
blasting cap.
O2 would have never blowon its own.
fire wasn't hot enough.
the perp rigged the transport to make it look like an accident.
might have gotten away with it if he had detonated it sooner.
fire dispersed pieces of the trigger.
he waited for the drivers to get out.
so he's not a murderer.
well, uh, at least he wasn't trying to kill the ambulance drers
trace it.
Gibbs, this is a garden-variety laminated paper substrate.
it's used as a cheap shielding in thousands -of electronic devices. -Yeah. So?
so, maybe I should get back to work.
did we get a positive match on our Marine's DNA?
you know, I've been a little busy here, Gibbs, with all the rubbing and the looking and the analyzing and the...
I should mention that Ducky's taking care of it.
I haven't seen a body this badly burned since the Bertram Mills' circus.
specimen jar.
Mr. Palmer?
sorry, Doctor.
just having a problem with the smell today.
Really?
I think he smells like my mother's fried chicken.
Yeah, that would be the problem.
Oh, I see.
well, the vegetarian lifestyle has been medically proven to be the healthiest of choices.
perhaps it's time you made the jump.
you wanted to see me, Duck?
well, actually, yes, Jethro.
then why do you look surprised to see me?
because I haven't told you that I wanted to see you.
Yes, well.
our latest houseguest has thrown us quite the little mystery.
define "mystery."
Yeah, well, the young lad's death certificate lists blunt-force thoracic trauma as the cause of death.
typical in motor vehicle accidents.
but I've only partially been able to verify that, since, as you can see, the postmortem damage is extensive.
Ducky. -Yes?
mystery.
Ah, of course.
well, you know me, Jethro.
I attempted to make an identification myself.
the blast destroyed his jaw and shattered his teeth.
it would take an inordinate amount of time to get an identification from dental records.
also, the fire so degraded his DNA that, you know, I spent the better part of yesterday -scouring his body. -Mystery.
uh, almost there.
by a stroke of luck,
I found a piece of tissue viable enough to send to have run against Danforth's DNA at the Armed Forces Repository.
this isn't William Danforth, Jr.
then who is this?
that, my dear Jethro, is the mystery.
lance Corporal Danforth's pro and cons were Five-Oh Five-Oh.
a real squirreled-away Marine.
so, what'd you find, Tony?
he's the Master of the Pan Flute.
it's helping me think.
what are you thinking?
I'm thinking that there are a lot of reasons for post-mortem mutilation you're overlooking, besides hiding a suspicious cause of death.
such as?
such as, enraged acts of violence, sadistic curiosity.
trying to hide the real identity of the victim.
that was the next one on my list.
is his identity in question? -Yeah, it is now.
Tony, get me a copy of that...
the names of the cops who processed Danforth's crime scene report. Already on its way, boss.
Ziva, take McGee and... -Have a chat with the doctor who pronounced the body dead, find out who made the I. D.
Hey, you want me to go and supervise that, boss?
actually, you know, I'll stay here just in case you need me.
Zamfir.
not-not saying you need me.
that's a bad word.
need's the wrong word.
the Director needs to see you in her office ASAP.
I was just going to tell the Director you're here.
Cynthia, did you know that when a Roman emperor made a triumphal march into Rome, he had a slave on his chariot who...
who whispered,"You're only human"into his ear. -Going in unannounced is whispering into her ear.
so, you're the Director's slave?
Cynthia is there to direct traffic, Agent Gibbs.
I'm just responding to your ASAP, Director.
this is Lance Corporal Danforth's father, William.
my sympathies, Mr. Danforth.
thank you, Agent Gibbs.
the SecNav would like us to keep Mr. Danforth in the loop throughout the entire investigation.
more than usual?
Yes.
gordo and I served together in Beirut, Agent Gibbs, and quite frankly,
I'm using that friendship.
wouldn't you?
he would.
sixth or Eighth?
Two-Six. Fox Company.
one-one. Scout Sniper Platoon.
Beirut?
desert Storm.
so, what can you tell me about my son, Agent Gibbs?
only what I read in the hospital and police reports.
Mr. Danforth has seen those.
he's asking how his son's body was incinerated.
it wasn't.
AFIS couldn't match the body in autopsy with Lance Corporal Danforth's DNA.
you're saying that it isn't Mr. Danforth's son?
not according to AFIS.
could there be a mistake?
one in nine million.
have Abby rerun the DNA. -Already on it, Director.
who the hell is it?
I'll let you know when I find out.
what should I tell his mother?
I wouldn't tell her anything yet.
right.
my numbers.
director Shepard, I'll tell Gordo how cooperative you've been.
least we could do.
Hey, Bill?
did you identify your son's body?
no. The, um...
police notified us that he had died, said that his body was being shipped to Bethesda.
do you think Billy could still be alive?
I think the hospital transported the wrong body.
bull.
the Marine from two nights ago, Danforth?
Yeah, I remember him.
are you the one who treated him?
treated? No.
unfortunately, all I did was pronounce him dead, Agent McGee.
it's hard to believe it's the same kid.
why is that?
he was a mess.
heavy contusions to the cranium.
pronounced facial lacerations. Half his skull caved in.
who ID'd his body?
a buddy gave us the tentative I. D.
and, uh, we also pulled his license from his wallet.
his buddy have a name?
I can do better than that. He's in ICU room five.
the police report didn't mention anything about a third injured party, Doctor.
that's because he wasn't injured, Officer David.
he's visiting.
our souls are like those orphans "whose unw-wedded "mothers die in bearing them.
the secret of our p... pat...
paternity lies in their graves and we must there to learn it.
herman Melville, Moby Dick.
call me Ishmael.
it's her favorite book.
doctors said it-it might help.
it's helping me a headache.
you're Rebecca's relatives?
uh, no. NCIS.
corporal Merrill, sir.
uh, at-at ease, Marine.
we're only here to ask you -a few questions. -Oh, of course, sir.
I...I mean ma'am
man, she doesn't like being called ma'am.
it's okay, though.
this about Billy, Ma... Miss?
if you mean Lance Corporal Danforth, yes.
we understd that you ID'd his body.
tried
Billy's face was all m- mashed up.
how did you know it was him?
who else c-could it be?
he was in the car with Rebecca.
this was the last time I saw them.
which was?
the night they were killed.
tell us about the night.
Billy had just landed stateside after his secmnd"tour in Iraq," so...
me, him and, uh, Rebecca, Billy's girlfriend
we were out celebratI. g at-at the Gold Monkey.
you're a good friend.
m- Me and Billy b-been ||ds since we was this big.
he was the only one who never made fun of my stutter.
you saw Lance Corporal Danforth get into the car?
I put him in it.
p- p... passed the a-accident on my way ||me.
uh, cops were already there.
said Billy's car hit a d... de%...
it's okay, Corporal.
we read the police report.
he was just lying there, all b...
uh, broken and be-bent up.
they were trying to, uh, uh...
save him, but I knew.
I- I just... I knew he was, uh...
Doctoraid he probably didn't feel anything.
think he was telling the truth, or just tryin'- tryin' to make me feel better?
doctors do that, don't they?
well, in my experiences,
E. R. doctors- they usually tell it like it is.
you got a favorite movie, huh? Got a favorite movie?
who's your Daddy now?
are you having fun, DiNozzo?
Ah. All done interviewing Danforth's C. O?
you done interviewing his platoon?
nothing builds rapport like a good game of ball.
that's the name of the game...
Thanks, guys.
the guys said Danforth was a top Marine, but the word is, he only joined 'cause his father was a Marine.
little looser, please.
my toes have gotten used to the whole, uh, blood thing, circulation.
word also is that, he was inseparable with another Marine, a- a Corporal...
kenneth Merrill. Yeah.
he followed Danforth into the Corps on the buddy program.
course he did.
the guy's as loyal as a Saint Bernard.
would you just focus, please?
and I'm starting to lose feelang in my pinky toe.
does that look right? -Yeah.
apparently, he was as loyal as a Saint Bernard.
according to his C. O.the Corps worked out pretty well for him.
Oh, yeah, he got into boxing, got his first girlfriend, and get this- turns out he had a knack for disarming IEDs.
his platoon called him the...
Forrest Gump of explosives.
I'm not trying to do yhur job, am I?
put an ice pack on that. 15 on...
15 off. Yeah, I know the drill.
Thanks, Corpsman.
Ooh, it's real swollen. I don't think
I'm going to be able to walk on this thing, boss.
look at that.
look, it's a miracle.
Yeah. Loyal as a Saint Bernard.
I always wanted to get one of those until I found out they didn't come with that barrel of whiskey around their neck.
you're wondering if Merrill helped his buddy fake his own death to get out of the Corps?
no. I'm wondering who they got tO play the part of the dead body.
you really think Lance Corporal Danforth
you got a better theory?
actually, we do, Tony.
I'd like to hear it, Agent McGee.
and yours as well, Agent DiNozzo.
both preferably sometime today.
we think Corporal Merrill may have killed Danforth, Director.
Why?
merrill conveniently forgot to tell us about the fight they had the night
Danforth was killed.
a fight over what?
Gibbs is not going to like this.
there a problem, Agent McGee?
uh, no, no, ma'am.
merrill claims that he was trying to stop him from drinking and driving.
according to the b! rtender, they broke two tables and a chair over it.
sounds like more than two good friends fighting to me.
I agree.
merrill also passed Danforth's accident on the way home.
he could have easily finished him off.
Nope. -Merrill goes to hide the body.
when he comes back to clean up, the cops are already on scene.
what about the other body?
there was a third party in the car.
we only have Corporal Merrill's word that the two of them drove off.
Tony No way.
wrong.
merrill shows up at the hospital, confirms the false I. D.
then, later, goes back, torches the ambulance before the real I. D. can be made.
no. Okay, I'm sorry. I got to interrupt.
cause...
here's the thing.
I have a theory that actually has motive which might be helpful.
I don't meant to belittle my colleagues efforts, but I am a senior field agent.
Danforth didn't hit a deer.
he hit Ducky's John Doe.
stick with me here.
he's drunk, right?
wasted, looking at five to ten for manslaughter.
so he switches the John Doe with his body, then skips town, right?
and then he has his buddy, Corporal Merrill, come along and torch the evidence.
that's how it happened.
it's pretty simple.
it's really just detective work
connecting the dots...
Hey, boss, I was just...
the Director wanted... she wanted...
with me. -Okay.
dramatic.
but duly noted, Agent Gibbs.
I get it.
that wasn't the way looked, boss.
I know.
the Director kind of suckered me into that deal.
Ziva caved first.
I didn't cave in. I was trying...
McGee next. -It wasn't...
and my loyal St. Bernard held out till last.
well, I... Probably all of 30 seconds.
so what is my team?
can I call you my team?
Yeah, of course.
what are you going to do now?
well, I think we should... -We...we could...
to solve the case?!
Tony, you impound... -Danforth's car.
have Abby see if it hit anything beside a tree.
then you and McGee... go to the original crash site.
McGee,I want an agent standing by Rebecca Crawford's rogm to get...
a statement. The second she wakes up, boss.
you got it.
and I'm with you, yes?
I don't know, Ziva.
are you?
definitely.
the improvised explosive device, gentlemen.
the weapon of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan.
the problem is spotting them when they look something like this.
now these are just a few of the IED configurations
I encountered on my last pump in Iraq.
today, I'm going to teach you how to locate, disarm, or if need be, blow them all in place.
corporal, you've got it.
take it over. They're yours.
gentlemen, you heard Corporal Merrill.
give me a huddle.
can I... can I help you, sir?
did you know that lying to a federal investigator is a crime?
I didn't lie.
what was the fight in the Gold Monkey about?
Billy was drunk, sir.
I tried to take his car keys away.
he started swinging.
I guess I didn't try h- hard enough.
you told me you placed him inside the car.
I did.
Billy m-must have made Becca pull over.
I should have... have...
you should have taken him home yourself.
Yeah.
Billy's dead, 'cause of m... me.
are you sure he's dead?
the burned body isn't Lance Corporal Danforth.
enough already.
you know I'm not the type to kiss and tell.
kiss?
I heard from a reliable source that you were out with Agent Larsen last night until about 2: 00 a. m.
who told you that?
I have information you want, you have information I want.
shall we dance?
forget it.
real mean always kiss and tell.
okay, so what are we looking for that the cops didn't already find?
they thought it was an accident.
but they were not using the honed eye of a highly trained federal agent.
probie, bring one of those numbers.
a prescription bottle of ibuprofen.
grunt candy. A marine's best friend.
must have been thrown from Danforth's car.
so?
so, it belonged to Corporal Merrill.
and there's blood on it.
come on.
say it.
say what?
you were right, Tony.
you'll be the bigger woman for it.
I'll just have to content myself being the...
well, the righter one.
woman?
you know what I mean.
I found Merrill's scrip at the scene, which means they were in it together.
and the DiNozzo body swap theory takes the lead.
what if he dropped it while killing Danforth?
Abby found Danforth's blood all over the windshield and the hood.
so much for your body swap theory, Tony.
I've seem more than a few people survive the windshield taste test, Ziva.
give it up, Tony.
you said Merrill was the Forrest Gump of explosives.
who else had the equipment and expertise to blow the up ambulance?
Ziva's right. Bring him in.
feeling pretty smug, aren't you?
Oh, yes, very.
so what's bugging that famous gut now?
Yes, you're that easy to read.
I learned how to speak "Gibbs" a long time ago.
you going to Abby's lab or autopsy?
Abby's. -Not to work my case.
I have the right to dig in to any NCIS investigation -that I want to. -Not mine.
unless you want me behind your desk again.
of course...
you could just observe and keep quiet.
fine.
as you know, this is the only piece of the trigger that I found.
I'm not really here.
do you know how long I've been waiting to cross over into an alternate dimension?
well, you're still here, Abs, for now.
what is this?
that's laminated paper substrate, boss, found in any number of electronic devices.
unfortunately I couldn't find a trace of a single one. But then,
I was surfing around on my favorite origami web ring and it hit me.
origami.
the ancient art of paper folding.
maybe the laminated substrate was the trigger.
you telling me Merrill folded himself a bomb?
no, that's impossible.
it came pre-folded.
see, several companies have been exploring the use of paper circuit boards for disposable products.
metallic ink is printed on laminated paper and then folded into the desired shape.
I coated our burned substrate with a metallic iron particulate.
which would attach to any residual metallic ink still present.
and then I ran the whole thing through an X-ray to pick up on any latent patterns.
voila.
you're looking at a partial circuit board for a disposable cell phone.
any chance we can read the...?
any chance we can read the...?
call log.
call logs.
I'd have a better chance
but I was able to pull a list of all the incoming calls to the hospital cell zone.
only three came in immediately prior to the explosion.
one of them was the priggering call
corporal Kenneth Merrill.
appreciate you meeting me, Bill.
sure.
how's she doing?
she's stable. Still in a coma.
you waiting to question her?
listen, the fire wasn't an accident.
how well do you know Corporal Kenneth Merrill?
he's like a son to me.
it wasn't an accident?
no.
the van was rigged to explode.
because Kenny defused IED's in Iraq, you think he had something to do with this.
no.
impossible.
her mother told me that Rebecca beused to be Kenny's girlfriend?
when they were children.
they've been best friends since elementary school.
the night of your son's accident, he was also in a fight.
my son liked to drink.
sometimes in excess.
Kenny was just trying to stop him from driving home drunk.
Kenny had nothing to do with this, Jethro.
it looks like the call that triggered the fire came from Kenny's cell phone.
what time was that?
9:00 about.
no, it wasn't Kenny.
he was with my wife and I from...
I don't know, since...
since before dawn up until at least noon.
Yeah, Gibbs.
Hey, boss, Corporal Merrill disappeared...
was that about my son?
no, Corporal Merrill.
after I questioned him, he walked out of the class he was teaching...
no one's seen him since.
we are partner?
OK
his son.
still alive.
sorry.
it was an accident.
wouldn't be the first time ues them to keep out of the trouble
thank you!
there's another possibility.
in the way, however went down,
Jreghro will find Merrill,
like Ricky Ricardo.
okay, guys, got his ATM records, check his recent activity
Ricky Ricardo, last two weeeks.
credit card records coming up.
tan! If I meant burnt umber,
I would have said burnt umber.
get... Whatever it is.
you know, You got some 'splaining to do, Lucy.
Hey, Boss. Just updating the BOLO on Merrill.
and checking the DMV to see to see if he's had any traffic violations recently.
and going through his financial records to try and pick up any leads off any recent purchases.
And?
and we can't find him.
but we're not going to give up until we do.
or die trying.
or die trying?
you had to put that in his head?
you wanted to see me, Duck?
Yes, I did. I was just about to call you.
small wonder DiNozzo is always looking over his shoulder.
I managed to put a couple of bits together.
yes... lower canine.
how long?
Oh, a week, maybe longer.
any odds of this reconstruction getting us an ID?
exceedingly long, but it's the only method I have for identifying these remains.
I've had long shots come in.
I- I once wagered a 500-to-one on the Irish Sweepstakes.
he fell at the first jump, but then recovered.
he fell at the second jump.
you'll never guess what happened next.
Yeah, Gibbs.
it's me, Gibbs!
you'll never guess what I found.
come on, Gibbs, guess!
I ran the prints from the bottle of Ibuprofen that Tony found at the Danforth accident site.
can I at least get a drum roll?
Ta-da.
pathetic.
prints?
the prescription belonged to Corporal Merrill.
all of the prints on the bottle belonged to Lance Corporal Danforth.
so?
merrill gave Danforth some of his grunt candy.
it wasn't grunt candy.
the bottle was empty, so I swabbed it and I ran it through the Mass Spec.
Cyclosporine/Azathioprine.
come on, Abs. In English.
they're antirejection drugs, Gibbs.
if Danforth was taking them, he's had a transplant.
the DNA I ran could be from a donor organ.
kind of turning me on.
I'm going to get another sample from Ducky.
this body could be Lance Corporal Danforth.
so urban myth.
Hey, Bill.
called your home.
wife said you were here.
you got bad news for me, don't you?
Yeah.
Where'd your son have his transplant?
does it matter?
no.
you can't stay in the Corps with a kidney transplant, Jethro.
who burned in the fire, Bill?
an unclaimed body at the hospital morgue scheduled for cremation.
I made a donation, they switched a toe tag and the County saved itself the cost of a cremation.
could have killed those EMTs, Bill.
no.
I didn't detonate that oxygen until they were clear.
Why?
your son was dead.
corps doesn't care if he had a transplant now.
they were more than friends.
they were a match.
corporal Merrill gave your son a kidney.
an autopsy would revl the transplant.
I was afraid that the M. E. would run a DNA check on the donor organ.
and you can't be on active duty if you gave away a kidney.
the Corps means the world to that boy, Jethro.
it's his life, and he risked everything.
he risked it all to help out his best friend, my son.
he rigged an IED to burn... -I did that.
bill! -I'll swear I did it.
Kenny had nothing to do with this.
why'd he go UA? -He didn't go UA.
he was at my place.
the things that Kenny's teaching those Marine going to Iraq will save their lives, Jethro.
come on, let me take the hit on this one.
Where's your son's body?
at the hospital morgue.
come on.
I do apologize.
usually one scraping is sufficient, but you are so crispy.
that should satisfy Abby.
Ah, Jethro.
Abby told me about the transplant and her theory.
you buy it?
well...
it is possible.
my money's on your teeth, Duck.
get back to it.
as soon as I give this to Abby.
I'll do it.
I've never seen you break evidence protocol before.
you don't trust me, Duck?
well, that's not the point.
chain of evidence is chain of evidence.
you're right about that.
I'd slap DiNozzo silly if he did it.
Jethro, you surprise me.
must be getting old.
God.
yes...
that's incredible.
no need for a dental match now, Duck.
the od on getting donor DNA from Danforth's body are astronomical.
alabama, 1954.
a nine-pound meteorite hits Annie Hodges.
the odds of getting hit by a meteorite?
astronomical
no pun intended. But it happens.
and I'm going to be published again.
peachy for you, but we just lost our victim.
our suspect.
our theories.
we've been barking up the wrong tree the entire investigation.
bush.
sorry, Bush.
we've been barking up the wrong... bush.
tree. So, who torched the ambulance and why?
don't look at me.
don't tell me.
well, yeah. Abby was right.
first test picked up donor DNA.
our John Doe is Lance Corporal Danforth.
good.
I mean, not good- a Marine is dead
but good that the case is no longer ours.
I know what you're going to say, Jethro, and don't.
I want Lance Corporal Danforth's remains returned to his father and I want the case turned over to the Maryland arson investigators.
that will make Mr. Danforth happy, which will make the SecNav happy, which in turn, will make me very happy.
we have wasted 'ay too many of our resources already.
okay.
haven't decided yet.
I like him.
you only like him because he bought us PSPs.
so you don't like him?
I didn't say that.
I'm just saying
I wouldn't be too nice to him.
we play it cool an Xbox could be right around the corner.
what's up?
it's already March, Sean.
it's still frozen. See?
come on.
Oh... Chicken.
Oh, who's the chicken now?
I'm coming.
hurry up or I'm gonna tell Mom.
come on, Sean!
apricot oil
aloe vera.
Shea butter?
I didn't know you were so interested in skin care.
it's not mine, it's McGee's.
maybe the probie is gay.
not gay, Tony.
are you saying there's something wrong with being gay, Timothy?
no, that is not what I am saying.
I suppose now you're gonna tell us that a lot of your friends are of the homosexual persuasion and that, uh, I should be more sensitive.
no, actually, I was going to tell you to stay out of my desk.
right.
cause you wouldn't want word spreading that...
you're "deep moisturizing to bring out your feminine glow."
I have dry skin. Okay?
my doctor recommended it.
well, you're walking a slippery slope there
Probalicious.
before you know it, you're gonna be taking bubble baths with your clogs on.
what is wrong with bubble baths?
load up.
just got a break in the Ryan Downing case.
weapons company first sergeant.
went U. A. last November on leave from Iraq.
not a peep since.
what's the break, boss?
two kids found the first sergeant floating under six inches of ice.
ice? That means...
you're now going to make a really juvenile cold-case joke.
it was a really good one, too.
something wrong, boss?
just admiring your feminine glow.
can't say I'm disappointed this one's yours.
we'll leave the lights if you guys return them.
Hey, we've worked with NCIS before.
whatta you got?
hopefully not pneumonia.
that could be the death of me.
I'm talking about the dead guy, Duck.
technically, paramedics have a saying concerning cold-water drownings, Agent Gibbs.
they say the victim isn't dead until he's warm and dead.
I think we can make an exception in this case, Mr. Palmer.
not a drowning.
this pond's barely six feet deep.
I once conducted an autopsy on a man who drowned in his kitchen sink.
Yes. Apparently, he couldn't loosen the drain plug, and attempted to use his teeth.
thought you were cold, Duck.
Yes, well, it'll be impossible to determine the exact cause of death until he thaws.
these three holes in his coat could be crucial.
how about time of death?
Yeah, well, decomposition suggests anywhere from two weeks to...
four months.
depending on how many times the pond has thawed out this winter.
very good, Mr. Palmer.
course, I'll have to check the meteorological data for the area before we speculate further.
Yes, strap him up.
I'm just saying, Probie, the whole metrosexual thing isn't working for you.
I got it, Tony. Joke is over.
not joking, man.
we all know that the ladies love a macho man who's in touch with his feminine side
but, I gotta tell you,
I think you're coming off a little gay.
because he uses body lotion and likes to take bubble baths? I...
you forget the manicure?
the manicure was only once, and it was because I tore a cuticle.
you just set off gaydar across the entire Atlantic Seaboard.
Tony, I am not gay.
this isn't about orientation.
this is about image.
so now your image is homo-pubic?
the term is "homophobic."And no.
prejudice of any kind is an ugly thing.
listen, girls like guys who like guys but they like guys who like...
no, Tony, back it up.
I don't know, it's thick soup, man.
the flashlight. Back it up.
what?
tree branch?
wearing a steel-toed boot?
eagle eye, boss.
mark it.
got another one!
these things always come in threes.
already got three, DiNozzo.
make it four.
I suppose a "bless you" is too much to ask for.
Oh, bless you, Doctor.
I wasn't talking to you, Mr. Palmer.
you know, the interesting thing about the sternutatory reflex is that no one knows exactly when it first began.
many theories abound.
and you know them all, don't you, Dr. Mallard?
know them? I once wrote a sonnet on the subject for an old flame.
she suffered from the most horrendous allergies.
Yes, how did it go? Uh...
doth thy heart skip a beat...
I'm not a big fan of poetry, Duck.
as it turned out, neither was she. In fact...
why am I here?
what?
why am I here?
Oh. You were correct earlier on, Jethro.
our first sergeant didn't drown.
none of our bodies did.
they were all shot.
first Sergeant Downing received the most damage.
three in the chest.
here, here and here.
and once to the back, just below the heart.
that's the kill shot, huh?
Yes, well, it ruptured his inferior vena cava.
as to our walking pictograms--one bullet each.
these gang tats?
it's not my field of expertise but I've had Mr. Palmer document the entire line for further investigation.
some of them were quite, uh, explicit.
Jethro, this young man was shot in the front, just below the left clavicle.
and this young man was shot in the back.
this young man was also shot in the back,like our first sergeant.
back, front, front, back
the pattern is quite random.
I believe the phrase is "turkey shoot.
more like "massacre.
definitely gang tats.
how can you be sure?
just a feeling.
I'm sure you know what those are like, don't you, McGee?
feeling, DiNozzo?
that, and I faxed a copy to a buddy at the Baltimore PD.
he's sending the intel that he's got back.
what have you got?
I have got... an upper limit on the timeframe.
well, it's an ATM receipt.
well, it used to be an ATM receipt.
the ink's washed off, but the dimensions match the receipt paper used by First Sergeant Downing's bank.
I checked his records.
last withdrawal, November 18.
the day he was reported missing.
no ID on the other three ice cubes yet, but the dredge team did find a weapon, HP. Browning.
Ziva brought it down to Abby.
brass?
nothing.
it's pretty far off the beaten track, about 500 meters from the nearest main road and you know what that means.
bodies were dumped.
by who?
that's a good question, McGee.
why don't you find me an answer?
good question. Find me an answer.
okay, if you slide your heel further back it'll decrease your exposure.
won't that throw off my lateral balance?
balance isn't usually the primary concern on a mission.
what is?
the guy shooting back.
which is what I'm gonna start doing if you two don't get back to work.
um, Gibbs? I was the one waiting for you.
what you waiting for now, Abs?
I ran ballistics on the Browning.
rifling patterns indicate it didn't fire any of the slugs Ducky pulled from the first sergeant.
three 9-millimeter Parabellums and a 45.
which means Downing was shot by at least two unaccounted-for weapons.
I got that part.
the dredge crew is still looking.
hopefully, more weapons will turn up.
the good news is...
I matched the Browning to the slugs pulled from the other three victims.
any prints?
no, not by a long shot.
and GSR would be pointless, because it's been underwater for so long.
but I did run the serial number.
the gun is registered to First Sergeant Ryan Downing.
looks like he went down fighting for his life.
or committed triple homicide.
the three bodies found with First Sergeant Downing were
were killed with his personal weapon.
I heard.
where are your glasses?
Oh, I forgot 'em.
I don't like what it says, either.
first sergeants don't go looking for this kind of payback.
you would.
I was only a gunny.
the Marine Corps is worried his company's gonna come back from Iraq and look for revenge.
could be a bloodbath.
how do you drink that swill?
how much time do I have?
they were to return this week.
were?
their rotation's been held up till your investigation's over.
they're still in a war zone instead of with their families, Jethro.
I don't care if First Sergeant Downing killed those gangbangers.
if he didn't, find out who did.
if he did, close the case.
you're wrong, Jenny.
you do care.
Ziva, if I ask you a question, you'd be honest with me, right?
of course, McGee.
what Tony...was saying about me before, you know...
do I come off as unmanly?
I think Tony was jerking your brain.
chain? Jerking my chain?
whatever. I think you're appropriately masculine.
however, perhaps not, uh, macho.
Tony and Gibbs are, uh, tough guys, yes, they're...
so I'm not, uh, I'm not tough.
if you have to ask...
these the other victims?
jorge Rubio and Hector "The Hammer" Menendez all members of the LVM.
LVM, boss, that stands for...
el Salvadorian street gang.
not just a street gang, Gibbs.
they have 30, 000 members worldwide.
they deal drugs, run guns...
they also hire themselves out as hit men.
Yes, which is what two of their members were allegedly doing a year ago when they mistakenly shot a private first class.
martin Reggio, a Marine from First Sergeant Downing's company.
we couldn't prove it.
downing was on a revenge mission.
first sergeants don't go on revenge missions, Officer David.
I would.
why not a Marine first sergeant?
they have more control than you do.
do either one of you have anything new to offer to this?
Yeah, boss, I think I do.
these three here, they weren't just members of LVM.
according to the FBI here, they are all lieutenants in LVM's Manassas chapter.
the boss?
why are we standing here?
wait, he-he's missing, he's been MIA since these three disappeared a few months ago.
let's go meet his replacement.
DiNozzo! Where the hell have you been?
I come bearing gifts.
spent the night at Rock Creek Park, and I found...
these...
when they drained the pond.
Whoa! That's a big one.
were you expecting an "atta boy"?
I thought it would be nice.
Atta boy.
I was just doing my job, boss.
I know that.
you would not think this is the headquarters of a worldwide crime syndicate.
what did you expect, McGee, a corporate headquarters building?
they're all armed.
keep your eyes open.
spread out.
who's El Jefe?
you are, Officer.
hey...
we're not local cops.
we're federal agents.
Federales?
who's in charge?
in charge?
in charge of what?
the Manassas chapter of La Vida Mala.
inside.
you're either DEA or Immigration.
you're not FBI.
they wear suits.
navy cops.
What'd we do to piss you off?
come on, man.
we get blamed for everything these days.
help me out.
we steal the admiral's car?
or his calzoncillos?
you killed two Marines.
the first in a drive-by shooting, the other in Rock Creek Park.
take me away.
you want one of them instead?
go with the Federales.
they need a suspect.
we know who did it.
you can keep those.
don't look surprised.
never seen him before.
he used to run your organization.
organization?
we're a social club.
you're not El Jefe.
no?
who am I?
see?
nobody laughs at the boss.
you have El Jefe give me a call, or I book him the next seat on the flight to Gitmo.
you can't do that.
we're not terrorists.
I'll have Tel Aviv produce an intercept between Al Qaeda and this...
social club.
you want photos?
that'd be good.
might take me 24 hours.
okay. 24 hours.
get a surveillance team on this taco shack.
actually, it's a pupusa shack, boss.
I'm just saying, tacos are historically assoc...
Ziva, you make sure they're visible.
okay, McGee, you come back here, you pick up anybody who's got a La Vida Mala clown tat.
what for, exactly?
I don't care, McGee.
drive around the block, I don't care, McGee.
okay, so you want us to shake them up.
if they're worried we're on to something, they'll start talking to each other.
get me intercepts on their cell phones, computers, pagers, smoke signals, any way they communicate.
boss, how are we gonna get a judge to sign off on all that?
didn't you hear, McGee?
la Vida Mala has ties to Al Qaeda.
well, yeah, but weren't we just saying that to sc...
unbelievable.
heard you rumbled with the Sharks.
the Sharks?
you know...
west Side Story?
Yes, McGee was quite impressive.
Ah. You didn't threaten them, did you?
sort of.
Ah. I had a buddy in the Baltimore Gang Unit did that to the local LVM.
they found his head in Crawford Park.
never did find the rest of him.
think I'd lie to you?
Yes.
to McGee I would lie;never to you, sir, never to you.
look out! Look out!
hope you've earned this, Abby.
Oh. The director already hooked me up.
she wanted an update, but I didn't tell her anything, I swear.
she's been on her phone since she got here.
Oh, that's mature.
you have something for me?
as a matter of fact, I do.
you looking over my shoulder again, Director?
why, you feel a little crowded?
Yeah, a little.
how's that?
better.
these are the four rounds taken from First Sergeant Downg's body.
three nine-millimeter Parabellum and one . 45.
I matched the. 45 to the Colt, that's a no-brainer.
the nine-millimeters are trickier, but I got a definite match on the Beretta and the Tec-nine.
that leaves us with...
this final round the runt of the litter.
Ducky said it went in through the back and lodged in the chest plate.
kill shot.
the rifling was almost stripped.
made it almost impossible to find out which weapon it came from.
but I did it.
which one was it?
neither.
we're missing a weapon.
then we're missing a shooter.
I understand you've got a job to do, Agent Gibbs.
my Marines have done theirs.
it's time for them to come home.
I agree, Captain.
well, then why is my company still sitting in Iraq?
you lost two Marines to a Virginia street gang, Skipper.
would you like me to spell it out for you?
headquarters is afraid of reprisals.
not only Headquarters.
PFC Reggio was killed in a drive-by shooting one week before your deployment.
now your first sergeant turns up dead you think first sergeant Downing was out for revenge
his body was found in the frozen pond with three dead gangbangers.
his weapon was used to kill them.
you tell me, Captain.
no way. Not his style, Agent Gibbs.
what was he doing back on leave in the States?
his father had cancer, terminal.
he wanted a chance to say good-bye.
I hope he got it.
he was shot four times.
kill shot was in his back.
you're a Marine do you know any first sergeants that would leave their men in combat to go chase after some street punks?
no, Skipper, I don't.
neither do I.
well, what are you gonna do about it?
we're working on the case on this end.
as soon as I know, you'll know.
sir
you people had a year to catch Reggio's killers, and you didn't do it!
at ease, Lance Corporal Silva!
but, sir...
at ease, Marine!
sorry, sir. I didn't mean to...
your watch is over, Marine.
we'll talk about this later.
Yes, sir.
I got 182 other Marines wondering the same thing, Agent Gibbs.
don't let them down this time.
are you looking over my shoulder again, Jen?
not exactly.
he's right, you know?
you can't let them down.
el Gordo's cell phone again.
probably his mamacita.
for a gangster, this guy leads a pretty boring life.
Ziva, ablaespal?
see Mucho.
Oh, bueno.
welcome to the wonderful world of Tomas Zepeda.
he's all yours.
kill the speaker phone.
they are exchanging greetings...
the plan for lunch...
Oh, and, um...
a double feature is scheduled.
movies?
Nope.
two "ho's" are coming over for something called, um...
a "rainbow party." Rainbow...
it's tough to translate slang.
it's my specialty. I'll take over.
Hey, I know my cholo from my chile.
I'll give you the summary.
I'll... give you the summary.
is that man lotion working for you there, Probie?
I didn't shave today.
I'm trying a new look.
when you say "today,
you mean the last couple minutes or...?
Abby seems to like it.
like what?
looks nice, McGee.
it's very manly.
may I?
Hey, boss!
why are you touching his face?
I don't know. It feels good, though.
it's like a bunny rabbit.
don't. -Sorry.
What're the wiretaps telling us?
not much.
the big guy. U.S. citizen, made five calls today.
twice to his mother, two for food, and one just now concerning...
ho's.
slang for...
I know what it's slang for, Ziva.
rest of the gang's conversations are even less promising.
the only member we've been unable to listen to is Cesar Bernal.
almost invisible, boss.
almost, McGee?
never talks on the phone.
only sends and receives text messages.
22 since yesterday.
all of them from Miguel Sosa in San Salvador.
texts are coded, but it looks as though Sosa's still making the day-to-day decisions for the gang.
then Bernal is his number two.
Tony, get him in here.
on it, boss.
use your contacts. Find out everything you can about Sosa and what he's doing in El Salvador.
done.
yes?
you're trying too hard.
on it.
your friend Zepeda's a chump.
you're probably right.
Zepeda's an idiot.
but last I heard, being stupid wasn't illegal.
I'm more interested in who killed my first sergeant.
talking to the wrong cholo, Senior.
I'm just a small fish.
talk to the jefe.
I would, but I can't type.
how about you?
Why?
you want to hire me as your secretary or something?
no, no, 'cause I can't pay as well as your current employer-- Miguel Sosa.
no, I can't do that.
you tell him I want to speak with him?
see?
I delivered your Gitmo threat.
Sosa said to ask you why you let your people live so far from work.
that vato, McGee, and the Israeli chica...
all the way out in, uh...
silver Spring?
a long way, see?
what if they need you pronto?
threatening my people is never a good idea.
I'm just the messenger.
a messenger that knows what happened at Rock Creek Park.
Estoy muerto if I talk to you.
estas muerto if you don't.
two Marines called Sosa to help unload captured Iraqi weapons.
two Marines?
see?
he sent our people to do a deal.
figured maybe the Marines will back off for, you know, what happened before.
who was the other Marine?
man, they don't invite me to these things.
I'm just a... a messenger.
I don't know.
three Marines from the company were on leave at the same time as First Sergeant Downing.
of those three, two were nowhere near D. C.
which leaves Lance Corporal Jose Silva.
juvenile record, suspected pre-Corps gang activity.
he was also with PFC Reggio the night he was murdered.
I want him on a plane.
yesterday.
Ah, Timothy. I suppose you're here for the D. O.D?
department of Defense?
no, no. Date of death.
Yes.
absence of larvae from airborne insects indicate the bodies were thrown into the water soon after death and were immersed for months based on the presence of adipocere, otherwise known as mortuary fat.
the First Sergeant was stateside on leave from mid-November.
Yes, well, the meteorological reports from the area indicate that the first hard freeze was December 9.
is that after shave I smell?
old Spice.
I had to shave mid-day.
Yes, I've heard about your infatuation with, uh... lotions.
the-the lotions... it was for a skin condition.
Oh, it's quite all right, Timothy.
skin care is something we should all take more seriously.
in my opinion, there's absolutely nothing gay about it.
uh, not that there's anything wrong with-with that.
so I've heard.
uh...so, a hard freeze December 9?
our key is that the bodies were not frozen inside the ice, but were below it.
so they died after the 9th?
no, no, no, no, no.
no, human bodies sink until the gases created by the internal putrefication have had time to accumulate.
how long does that take?
under the forecasted weather conditions?
ten to 14 days.
the bodies went into the water between November 25 and December 9, or they would have resurfaced and the top ice would have formed around them.
precisely.
have we any idea what our Marine was doing there yet?
no, Duck, I don't.
but we're gonna find out in 11 hours and 30 minutes.
Hey!
how was the flight, Lance Corporal?
it was, um... long, sir.
how much trouble am I in?
trouble? Why would you say that?
four NCIS agents escorting one Lance Corporal?
you got it all wrong, Marine.
she's Mossad.
I hope you slept on the plane, Lance Corporal.
Yeah, it's gonna be a long night.
you want to get the cash first, or the Iraqi weapons?
not scaring you, am I?
I'm fine.
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
Really?
cause you were on leave with First Sergeant Downing, and you were with PFC Reggio the night he was killed in the drive-by shooting.
I can't help a coincince.
a coincidence, Lance Corporal?
five dead bodies, you're our only link.
your company, your fellow Marines, are stuck in Iraq until we solve this case.
you don't think I know that, sir?
he knows, he just doesn't care.
Hey, Silva, you know what?
we had a name for guys like you when I was on active duty.
a Bravo Foxtrot.
it's an explicit term for a sexual...
it wasn't supposed to happen like this!
like what?
if a drive-by killing isn't solved right away, the cops forget it.
NCIS forgot about it!
private Reggio was my best friend.
he died in my arms.
I couldn't just let that go, sir.
so you decided to turn a quick buck?
no. I called Sosa to meet... but...
but not to sell him any weapons.
I wanted blood.
and your first sergeant found out about it.
I don't know how... but he did.
he yanked my leave and restricted me to base.
then he went to the meeting in your place.
he didn't go down there to kill anyone, sir.
he went down there to make peace.
to end it.
he didn't want anyone else to get hurt.
if I could, I'd switch places with him.
I would.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think you would, Lance Corporal.
checks out.
Quantico gate log shows that
downing restricted Silva to base on November 26 for the duration of his leave.
lance Corporal Silva wasn't at the pond, didn't kill anyone.
thank you.
I owe you one, Simon.
that was my contact in San Salvador.
he locate Sosa?
no. He's not there.
he has to be.
Bernal's texting him there a dozen times a day.
if Simon says he's not in San Salvador, then he's not there, McGee.
he has to be.
Gibbs, I'm tell...
if not, we've wasted three days.
I am not wasting one more to bring those Marines home.
you find him. Now.
men, we are here today for three reasons.
one...
we can't find Miguel Sosa.
two...
I'm not even sure that he exists.
and three...
who are you talking to?
you will address me as "sir," soldier!
sorry.
who are you talking to, sir?
my army.
captain Comparison Microscope.
Ensign...
isn't an Army rank, it's actually Navy.
what do you want, McGee?
to go over the old text messages between Cesar Bernal and his boss, Miguel Sosa.
they're in code.
I know, but if we break them, we might find where Sosa's hiding.
he's in San Salvador.
Ziva's people say no.
Oh, so if Ziva's people say "no," then we should...
Abby, please, just run them.
okay.
my, uh, my Spanish is a little rusty.
mine's not.
okay, in this one...
they're asking Sosa if they should...
wait a minute.
what?
it's too long.
sms text messages are limited to 150 characters, so that means...
that means that it was e-mailed from a computer not a cell phone.
can you backtrace it to a physical location?
just a simple matter of accessing the E-mail-to-SMS Gateway, pulling an IP linking to an ISP...
that's a Virginia address.
Ziva's people were right.
let me see if we can get a name of the account holder.
that doesn't make any sense.
why would he send messages to himself?
because he was pretending he's Miguel Sosa.
okay, but that's stupid.
cause Sosa would totally find out and kill Cesar.
not if Cesar killed him, first.
Uh-oh.
what is this meal gonna cost me this time?
didn't cost you anything last time.
you mean aside from the thousand extra calories I didn't need?
I can leave.
I didn't say that.
Salvadorian food?
how fried.
OK, Sit. I'm sorry.
another Marine was injured in Captain Arvidas' group.
I know.
I heard you found the man responsible for First Sergeant Downing's death.
his name is Cesar Bernal.
can you make a case?
I knew this meal was going to cost me.
okay, what do you have so far?
cesar is making a power play for control of his crew.
he's been faking orders from Miguel Sosa to the rest of LVM for the last four months.
and Sosa?
he's dead.
that's the only way Cesar could have gotten away with it.
so First Sergeant Downing wasn't the target.
he was Cesar's lure.
the real targets were the three LVM lieutenants.
cesar was taking out the leadership.
do you have any physical evidence?
nothing linking Cesar to the crime scene.
Jethro, you're going to need more than motive to get a jury to convict.
depends on the jury.
this is harassment.
when I get out of here, I'm going to get me a fancy lawyer and shove him all the way up your...
Oh, come on, it was just getting good.
okay, who wants to take him first?
I'm gonna take him.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I got it, Probie.
what, do you think I can't handle this guy?
Gibbs said keep him on ice, not show him the warning signs of osteoarthritis.
Tony, I can break this guy.
you keep cracking your knuckles like that, you're gonna break a finger, Probie.
I'm senior. I go first.
you are always going to be senior.
that's the nice thing about being senior, is that...
Ahora.
so I cooperate with you and this is the thanks I get?
hauled in like a pescado muerto?
if by cooperate you mean lie, yes.
what did I lie about?
we know you were at the Rock Creek Pond the night of the murders.
and we know you've been killing off the LVM leadership to assert control.
you must think very highly of me, because the man who can pull off something like that, must be a very smart man.
do you like smart men, Bonita?
sorry, you're not my type.
you're playing with fire, Bonita.
is that a threat?
no.
I'm just saying, my eses get very lonely when I'm not around.
and they're not going to be too happy with the one that's keeping me from them.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm sure your eses will find something to do while you're gone.
the autopsy of First Sergeant Downing revealed four entry wounds.
however, of interest is the fact that the three frontal wounds showed no sign of internal hemorrhaging.
the shots were fired after First Sergeant Downing was dead.
each of your buddies put a bullet in his corpse.
your point?
point is, if your buddies each fired a round into the First Sergeant after he was dead, who shot them?
I want to talk to my lawyer.
no can do. Punk.
you been watching too many cop shows, know that?
Yeah, well, you've been watching too many...
gang... person shows.
I don't think Probie's been watching enough cop shows.
McGee is a capable interrogator.
he can be quite intimidating when he wants to be.
you can't keep me here like this.
no, actually, I can.
see, La Vida Mala has suspected ties to Al Qaeda.
so all I have to do is say the word "terrorist
and I can keep you in this room 'til you grow old and die.
that actually was intimidating.
we can tell from the rifling patterns that the slugs pulled from your three dead LVMs were from the Browning found at the scene.
nice tat.
huh?
your Drachenkreuz.
the symbol of the ancient order of mystic...
sorry, Gibbs.
um, the point is that whoever shot your guys used First Sergeant Downing's gun.
he wanted to make it look like our First Sergeant smoked your muchachos.
of course, your crew probably would have only turned their backs to the shooter if it was someone they really trusted.
so, like, you don't got no questions for me?
that's a double negative.
huh?
"don't got no"is a double negative.
it's a non-standard use of two negative words in the same sentence cancel each other out and create a positive.
actually, in Shakespeare's day, the double negative was used as an emphatic, but now it's just considered a mistake. Oh!
don't know if that's what you intended.
pretty sure it's not.
we'll just go with the whole colloquial idiomatic thing.
this is hard.
I'm pretty sure you meant do I have any questions, and the answer to that questions is
I have no questions.
I do have some observations, though.
cesar it's an interesting name.
obviously derived from Caesar.
that was a powerful dude.
my name's Anthony.
friends call me Tony, which backwards is Y-Not.
anyway, in the pecking order,
I'm guessing that you're somewhere between the guy that goes out and buys the spray paint that you use for tagging and the guy who digs it out from under your boss' nails.
you don't know who you're messing with.
one word from me, and my crew will have you splattered.
your crew?
Yes.
well, that's funny.
I thought LVM was Miguel Sosa's crew.
interesting.
word on the street is he is hiding out in El Salvador.
except the FBI has no record of him leaving the country.
Salvadorian authorities have no record of him coming in.
so the only trail we have is the SMS text messages he's been sending you, problem is...
he hasn't been sending them.
el Salvador country code has been falsified.
someone faked them to make them look like they came from Miguel Sosa.
messages originated from an e-mail account registered to Cesar Bernal.
he killed your boss.
played you for a fool.
us, too.
he'll never get a conviction in court with what I have on him.
Hi, boss.
right.
I see.
you were all trying to throw me off balance, soften me up for the big guns, eh?
actually, I didn't know you were still here.
come on. I'll drive you home.
wear your safety belt.
door-to-door service.
I could get used to this.
what's the matter?
you pissed because whatever game you tried to play didn't work?
you got a lot to learn about the streets, cabron.
loyalty means everything in our world.
without it, estas muerto.
thanks for the lift.
semper fi.
good-bye, Cesar.
cuepaso, hermanos?
these NCIS pendejos just won't quit, eh?
I got a message from Sosa.
he thinks we ought to teach them some manners.
what?
the victim, a male in his early 20's was found in this dumpster, shot repeatedly at close range.
police have identified him as Cesar Bernal, a native of El Salvador, and say they believe he has close ties to gang activity in the Manassas area.
in fact, police say...
if you don't have enough work to do,
I'm sure I can find some.
Oh, no, I got a lot of work to do, boss.
lots of work.
good.
I'll be in MTAC.
captain.
agent Gibbs.
I hope you have some good news for me.
bring our boys home.
is it clean?
of course it's clean, Lillian.
well, the last time we were here,
I saw a cockroach, Albert.
that wasn't a cockroach.
Oh, all of a sudden, you're an expert.
I'm an entomologist. 32 years.
I think I'd know a cockroach if I saw one.
well, I can assure you folks, our rooms are maintained to the highest standards of...
cockroach habitability?
I was going to say cleanliness and neatness.
however, if you folks are unhappy with the room in any way...
stay single.
...just let me know and can see about getting you an upgrade.
I think we'll take that upgrade.
in my professional opinion, the risk of serious injury is substantial.
I agree.
but there are protocols that have to be followed.
which are useless if it doesn't impart a tactical advantage.
don't underestimate appearances, Ziva.
I've have known entire missions to fail because an asset didn't button her lapel properly.
I see your point.
so we are in agreement?
both: Heels.
I hate court.
your sacrifice is noted and appreciated.
let's talk outfits.
I say you just go with the heels.
is that inappropriate? Sorry.
nice Jimmy Choos there, Abs.
can we help you, Agent DiNozzo?
Yes, I've come to collect Officer David.
boss got the Bat Signal.
I showed up just in time.
another minute, and you guys would have been braiding each other's hair.
and who knows where that can lead to, Tony.
where are we going?
little Creek.
ZIVA: Little Creek Base?
actually, it's an off-base Navy lodging facility used mostly by TDY personnel and visiting family.
apparently there was some kind of bloodbath.
Mondays. What's the body count?
who said anything about a body, DiNozzo?
all we're missing is a kid on a Big Wheel and a man in a bear suit.
and in your head, that makes sense to you?
Yeah, it's TheShining, Ziva.
now that you mention it, what was that guy doing in a bear suit?
woman: I'm just saying that this wouldn't have happened at the Marriott.
excuse me for not checking the axe-murderer policy when I made the reservation!
did you request this specific room when you called the Lodge?
no, we requested the one with the eviscerated squirrels, but this is all they had.
what the hell kind of question is that?!
our last one.
bell BOY: Did I mention we have over 100 channels of crisp, clear cable?
GIBBS: Talk to me, DiNozzo.
occupants checked out two days ago.
room was cleaned yesterday, then locked tight.
no sign of forced entry?
no, but a previous guest could have kept the key.
we're going over lists.
field test says the blood was human.
we don't know what parts those are.
Dr. Mallard is still working on the bathroom.
I'd take an umbrella if you go in there.
Tony: Doesn't make sense, does it, boss?
if it's a prank, it should be animal blood.
if it's a Satanic ritual, where are the pentagrams?
could have been an interrogation that got out of control.
or a drug deal gone bad. Look at this.
Tony: How bad does a drug deal have to go for you to leave the drugs behind?
find out what happened here.
I know something of what happened.
all this scattered organic detritus is human fascia, fibrous connective tissue that anchors skin to muscles.
if you look closely, you see neither skin nor muscle.
Yeah. I'll take your word for it.
all of this tissue was skillfully extracted, possibly during extensive postmortem procedure.
someone was dissected here, Duck?
more likely three someones.
and whoever the guilty party is, he didn't get his technique from the Internet.
you're looking...
for a trained medical practitioner.
no. No doctors or surgeons stayed at the Lodge in the last two months.
now checking surrounding ho...
hotels.
you missed again, Tony.
did I, McGee?
remember, "Goals are deceptive."
the unaimed arrow never misses.
what kind of loser wrote that?
I think it's good advice.
Really?
well, then, I-I have the perfect one for you.
in great attempts, it is glorious even to fail.
didn't Vince Lombardi say that?
well, hold on to that one, but the rest of these are worthless.
nice calendar, McGeek.
Hey! Relax. This stuff will melt your mind.
it's not good for you, it makes you weak.
Tony, it was a gift.
from who, your wet nurse?
GIBBS: No.
from me.
it's a nice calendar, boss.
anybody find me my doctor yet?
not yet, but we do know how he got in the room.
a maid had her master key stolen two days ago.
she see anything? No.
david: I ran the prints from the crime scene-- 15 total.
all from registered guests. Only two were in the area last night.
bring them in.
unfortunately, they both have airtight alibis.
looks like the unaimed arrow missed after all.
now that amateur hour is over,
I draw your attention to the plasma screen in the middle of the room.
psychopathic blood spatter.
usually randomly scattered; take a look at the drips on the wall.
it's a little Jackson Pollock, but you notice anything?
they're emanating from a central point.
step off, McFlower Power.
you've had your chance to speak.
they're emanating from a central point.
Tony: Then there's the TV. It looks like it was knocked off the bureau in a struggle of some sort, right?
except that Abby found CRT shards in a bath mat.
so?
so... Dr. Giggles laid the television on the floor, covered it with the bath mat, to muffle the sound, and he broke it.
crime scene was staged, boss.
victims were killed someplace else.
where?
what, I gotta do all the work?
I-I'm going to get right on that.
do that, DiNozzo.
you're doing most of it anyway.
Ooh.
I think it best to start with a corner piece, Mr. Palmer.
uh, Doctor, I...? Haven't you ever done a jigsaw puzzle?
you always start with the corners.
may I suggest the plantar fasciae.
the feet? Yes.
and then build it up from there.
the anterior fasciculus of the...
of the ankle... Mm-hmm!
and then the fascia crusis of the lower calf.
well, thank you, Doctor.
that's a very helpful analogy.
and a fitting one, too, considering the original term for "jigsaw puzzle" was "dissected maps
so named by Europeans in the late 1760s.
they used to take maps and cut them up into irregular pieces for their children to reassemble.
Hello, Jethro.
right on schedule.
that predictable, Duck?
that thorough.
we still talking three bodies here?
well, that's why we call it "preliminary findings."
actually, we have the remains of at least four individuals, and perhaps considerably more.
Jimmy: At first, we thought there might be a serial killer.
uh, not that that is a good thing.
unfortunately, Mr. Palmer's private hopes were dashed when I noticed, in our latest meat puzzle, traces of vascular tissue.
it's exactly what you would see if you looked into a medical disposal bin after surgery.
that is if you cared to look, which apparently our perpetrator did.
doc, are you saying these remains are medical waste?
it explains the precision of the incisions.
all of these pieces of tissue were removed by a surgeon, disposed of, rescued, and then put on display for reasons, well, I will leave you to ponder.
we're being set up.
DUCKY: So it seems.
but set up for what?
sigmund Freud, eat your heart out.
McGee, no lurking without a permit.
sorry.
just, uh, checking to see if you finished the analysis on that powder yet.
field test said it was cocaine, but...
I told you I was gonna e-mail you the results when I was done.
Yes.
don't you have court today?
I'm finished.
all I had to do was give a deposition.
Oh.
so, don't have to go back or anything?
you came all the way down here to see me in my court suit!
no...
you totally did!
no, I did not.
your mouth lies, but your red ears are telling the truth...
what? What's wrong?
do you smell that?
no.
it's almonds. We have to get out of here!
what's going on?
cyanide gas!
hydrogen cyanide gas.
another three minutes in here...game over.
how did this happen?
Abby said the coke was bad.
it contained potassium cyanide, which turned gaseous when she added the...
the "acidified cobalt thio...
cynit... cyan...
thio..." MAN: Cobalt thiocyanate.
cobalt cyothionate, uh... yeah, from her drug test kit.
so this was an accident.
Abby doesn't have accidents.
well, Abby also doesn't have enemies.
I mean, it's not like we're talking about Agent DiNozzo. Hey!
ma'am.
crime scene was a set-up, Director.
right now, Abby's our best lead.
while she and McGee were playing in the shower, Ziva and I took a walk through the World of Sciuto.
our mistress of the dark is keeping secrets from us.
this is so embarrassing.
okay, in my defense, what self-respecting drug dealer cuts his cocaine with potassium cyanide?
obviously one that doesn't care about repeat business.
luckily, your exposure to the gas was brief.
I don't anticipate any long-term ramifications.
better not be.
you two don't have permission to be sick.
we're fine, Gibbs.
the only damage done was to my ego.
it was a newbie accident.
what?
we're not so sure it was an accident, Abs.
"not sure" meaning what?
we think whoever set up the crime scene might be after Abby.
me?
who would want to kill me?
I mean, Tony, I understand...
Hey!
the name Mikel Mawher ring a bell?
ZIVA: It should.
he placed over 200 phone calls to you in the last four months, one of them.
right before the accident.
you went through my phone records?
and your credit card bills.
did you really buy this guy Mawher a straightjacket for his birthday?
okay, slow down. Okay... Sounds like you two were pretty serious.
until she filed a restraining order against him.
I'd say the straightjacket was a red flag there, Abs.
DUCKY: How come we've never heard about this gentleman? Okay.
I dated him last year, and things just got a little out of hand.
did I mention the restraining order?
okay, it was a lot out of hand.
why didn't you come to me, Abby?
because, Gibbs, I wanted him restrained.
I didn't want him beaten to a pulp with a baseball bat.
and I'm embarrassed.
it wasn't great taste in boyfriends.
Yeah, I saw the web-shrine dedicated to you.
it's creepy...
but it's not dangerous.
he just can't accept that it's over between us, but he's not a violent type.
guy cleans up crime scenes for a living, Abs.
I know, that's what I liked about him.
but I'm telling you, Gibbs, he's not your man.
you're going to pay him a visit, anyway.
could you pick up my red studded dog collar while you're there?
free decomposition odor removal included in all double homicides.
I can see why she fell for the guy.
they even have the same taste in music.
man: Hey!
you ruined my shot!
I take that back; not bad.
I should redo my before-and-after shots for my new brochures.
you know, "Name the crime scene, we'll wipe the grime clean.
so what do you got, huh?
sub accident?
explosive decompression?
never worked with NCIS before.
Yeah, the restraining order probably made that kind of little difficult, huh?
I-I don't know what you're talking about.
the only reason you're still able to walk is because I never heard about you until today.
okay, that restraining order!
look, this is not necessary, okay?
all right, I shouldn't have called her earlier.
I just wanted to apologize.
you got something to apologize for, do you?
Yeah, I was a little crazy before.
look, I was in therapy, okay?
I found that I was projecting my own obsession onto Abby, and, therefore, she did not want to reciprocate it, and I just wanted to call and apologize for any pain and suffering I put her through.
is Abby in some kind of trouble?
you tell me.
Oh, my God.
look familiar?
no, but for two grand, I can make it look like...
Hey. Okay, look.
I don't know what you're talking about, okay?
I'm cured now, I'm good!
you know, I'm on antidepressants.
I have a new girlfriend!
well, now all you need is an alibi for the last two days, and you're golden.
well, then, I'm golden, you know?
it's been drive-by central since the full moon, man.
all the crazies are out, you know.
and that makes you golden how?
because I've been with D. C. Metro for two whole days, that's why.
ABBY: The lunar effect is a myth.
there is no statistical correlation between the phases of the moon and human behavior.
that's why it would never work with us.
because the lunar effect is a myth?
no, because I'm a scientist, and he plays with voodoo dolls.
but you play with voodoo dolls, Abby.
I meant it metaphorically, McGee.
I don't think they actually do anything.
I just play with them, you know, to relax.
well, looks like you can put away your Mike Mawher doll then.
metro confirmed Mawher's alibi.
Tony: Cleaned eight crime scenes over the past four days.
been surrounded by homicide detectives the entire time.
any of the crime scenes match what we found at the Navy Lodge?
Nope; not even close.
then I'm off the hook.
not necessarily.
he could have had an accomplice.
leave it to the assassin to rain on my parade.
or maybe it was just a lab accident.
I mean, really, who would want to kill Abby?
McGee: You know, that's true.
it's not like someone was after Tony.
that's a suspect list I wouldn't want to run down again.
I think the joke's over-- we get it.
and our suspect list, Ziva?
uh, we don't have one.
but I can contact the local medical waste facilities and see if anyone reported a break-in.
DiNozzo. I'll run a background check on the Lodge employees-- maybe someone's got a vendetta against the cleaning staff.
well, I can, um,
I can go check on...
boss, I'm not really sure what I should do.
go home.
take Abby with you.
Gibbs, I'm fine!
I only have one stalker, and he has an alibi.
I don't want you to be alone tonight, Abs.
you're going with McGee.
great.
like I haven't been traumatized enough today.
nothing like a nice relaxing video game to calm the nerves.
pretty good, huh?
I've seen better.
did you change the refresh rate?
I downloaded new OpenGL drivers for you.
you're getting a way higher FPS now.
I was in the bedroom, like, a minute.
I also optimized your TCP-IP settings.
increased your throughput by 50%.
bedtime.
I am going to take this sleeping bag...
we're adults, McGee.
we can share the same bed.
if you promise to keep your hands to yourself.
clearly, you haven't been.
your shirt smells like J-Lo Glow.
Oh, I can't find my toothbrush.
I think my it fell out in your car.
that's all right.
your old toothbrush is still in my bathroom.
you kept my old toothbrush?
that's a little creepy, McGee.
maybe you should take the sleeping bag.
what is creepy about it?
I just never bothered to throw it out.
what? This is not my toothbrush.
well, then I must have bought a second one and forgot about it.
it's a ladybug toothbrush, McGee.
that's for cute girls named GinaMarie that bake cookies and wear J-Lo Glow.
not a quasi-manly federal agent who carries a gun.
you want to use it or not?
an anonymous toothbrush?
I would rather remove my own tonsils with Typhoid Mary's straight razor.
where are you going?
to get my toothbrush.
no, no, no, you're not leaving the apartment.
why not, McGee?
we both know Gibbs is just being overprotective.
I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me, and if Gibbs finds out I let you leave.
that's a really good point-- you go.
I am not leaving you alone, either.
fine, then-- I'll just use your toothbrush.
don't open the door for anyone.
what? I told you not to open the door for anyone. What'd you forget?
my keys. Why do you need keys if I'm here?
my car keys.
now, listen to me, you do not open the door, okay?
not for anyone, or I will tie you up.
Really?
Hi, Abby.
I, I forgot how beautiful you are.
I mean, up close, I mean.
what are you doing here, Mikel?
you're in terrible danger.
I got that part.
no, no, I'm here to save you.
what are you saving me from, Mikel?
how could you even ask that after what happened to your lab?
Oh, right... my lab.
how did you know about that?!
can we not do this right now?
wait, wait. McGee!
there you go, playing the frightened victim again.
McGee! Could you not cast me as a psychopathic stalker?
believe me, the role is yours!
well, I'm sick of it, okay?
I thought you almost dying would make you realize how much cared about me and how much I care about you.
but I realize I was wrong.
maybe I was foolish for trying and trying and trying.
but I'm telling you, you're going to thank me, okay?
geez, you still carry the handcuffs I gave you.
that's really great, 'cause I still have the key.
I'm never picking up a guy in a cemetery again.
listen, Abby, I just want to start over.
mikel, go away!
we had fun, didn't we?
until you bugged my phone, you nut-job!
I could pick a lock, too.
you forgot about that.
nothing on the statewide BOLO yet.
ZIVA: Get off your knees.
it's just a typewriter, McGee.
no ATM transactions, hasn't touched his credit cards.
was a typewriter.
and she messed up my motherboard so badly the BIOS got screwed up and I had to a hard reset.
how traumatizing for you, McGee.
Tony: Go easy on him, boss.
even a hair out of order traumatizes McGee.
put this on the plasma.
Where's your chair?
GIBBS: He doesn't deserve to sit.
with that ass?
didn't find Mawher, boss.
guy's totally disappeared, but I found this in his apartment.
ZIVA: He's been tracking her for a while.
so much for that restraining order.
I spoke to his supposed girlfriend, they went on one date.
all he talked about was Abby.
I'll find out more this weekend.
we're having dinner. No, you don't eat until you find the guy trying to kill Abby.
boss, actually, I have an idea about that.
I've been analyzing the incoming packets on Abby's system.
there appears to be a shell code.
um, I think that Mawher's been worming into Abby's computer to monitor her communications.
you think you can trace the worm?
if he tries to access again, yeah.
coordinate with Abby.
boss, gonna have to try and get her out of the elevator first.
Hey, Gibbs.
did you know that only five of the 2. 5 million deaths every year occur in elevators?
no.
Ziva gave me this.
and Cynthia gave me the pepper spray.
the knuckles are Director Shepard's.
no one is going to hurt you, Abby.
you're just saying that to make me feel better.
did it?
Yeah.
can you say it again?
nobody's going to hurt you, Abs.
can I stay at NCIS until you catch him?
Mm-hmm.
I'll move your whole lab into the elevator if it'll make you feel better.
tech: Singapore has infiltrated Abu Sayyaf.
SHEPARD: Good.
forward this to Sealift Command, ASAP.
right away, ma'am.
I picked a bad week to cut out caffeine.
abu Sayyaf?
singapore's mole believes that they've infiltrated a pre-positioned ship at Diego Garcia.
I'll fill you in later.
how's Abby?
she's scared.
I thought this Mawher fellow had an airtight alibi.
alibi, yes; airtight...
is that... Jamaican Blend?
Yeah.
alibi, yes; airtight, no.
the last thing a homicide cop worries about is his cleanup guy.
Yeah, well, your cleanup guy just made an interesting play.
Abby's been subpoenaed again.
I thought she was done with the court.
she was, until the defense got an anonymous e-mail saying that the consultant for the prosecution had gone into protective custody.
Mawher must've found out... You don't use cream and sugar, do you?
Mawher must have found out about the case from Abby's computer.
and now he's trying to lure her out.
does the defense know they're being used?
they don't care.
my guess is that they're going to use Abby's restraining order to claim that her... judgment is faulty.
her judgment?
Yeah. The defense it gonna argue that she makes bad choices.
I don't know this defense lawyer, I've never dealt with her, but, obviously, she likes to win.
she does.
you know her? Yeah, I thought I did.
if she wants to talk to Abby, she can do it here.
Yeah, agreed; I'll pass it on.
Jethro, could you leave...
I already did, Jen.
any luck with that trace yet, McGee?
Nope. Maybe we should widen the perimeter on Mawher's BOLO.
Hey, Tony!
not so loud.
I was up all night scrounging through that guy's garbage, for Pete's sake.
I'm Jack Kerouac, baby-- I'm beat.
so, the drive wasn't so bad.
at $400 an hour,
I'm sure you'll reconsider when you get my bill.
Tony: I'll take it from here, thanks a lot.
uh, hi.
may I help you?
Yes.
first, eat a breath mint, and then, you can take me to the overprotective candy-ass who made me come all the way down here for a simple deposition.
he's over there.
man...
I should have known.
Hello, Jethro.
Hello, Ginger.
or should I say "overzealous defense attorney "who came all the way down here to harass my forensic scientist?
do they know each other?
nothing gets by you, does it?
harassment is illegal, whereas I have a subpoena.
how about that? So do I.
you want the e-mail that tipped us to the restraining order.
Why? We're hoping there's routing information in the header that can help us trace it.
going after the whistle- blowers now, are we?
no, just stalkers.
wait, wait, slow down a second.
who's being stalked?
her name is Abby.
ZIVA: And your lawyer is going to try to use her bad taste in men to impregnate her credibility.
impugn, Ziva.
Yes. What does any of this have to do with the embezzling charges?
Tony: Whew! Embezzling!
nice!
how much?
Oh, uh, they say $10 million, but I'm innocent.
I-I was framed.
Yes, in your case, I actually believe that.
don't say another word.
Where's my witness?
Where's my e-mail?
Hi.
the e-mail helped narrow down the DNS server, but I still have a ways to go on the trace.
I thought computers are supposed to make things go faster, McGee.
they do-- it's just that the X-originating-IP address leads to a public IP address, and...
I'll let you know when I have something.
Ziva, go home.
I'm staying if you're staying.
I'm staying.
well, I'm staying.
I'm staying, too.
I'm sure Abby feels safer already.
I see you've vacated the elevator for the evening.
it wasn't quite so cozy in there after an hour with Queen Boudicca.
did you know that the five people that die in elevators every year, they only spend an average of 60 seconds in there in a day?
and you've already been in one for six hours.
exactly-- increasing my risk by a thousand-fold.
I'm lucky to be alive, Ducky.
well, it's not luck when you have Leroy Jethro Gibbs looking after you.
however, one cannot be too careful, so I brought you a present.
it's a safety whistle.
emits 120-decibel blast.
one good blow of this, and your attacker's eardrums are shattered.
thank you, Ducky.
boss, I'm getting a verification ping on my tracer program.
I'm trying to back-trace.
you think you could type any harder, McGee?
this guy is good-- he's bypassed all our authentication routines.
Ziva, you getting this?
Yes, looks like Mawher accessed Abby's account 30 minutes ago.
McGee? Yeah.
he used her terminal to send an e-mail to...
ZIVA: The Pass and I. D. Office on the Navy Yard?!
he was giving himself a drive-on.
security.
Jimmy, you don't have to keep calling me-- I'm fine.
it's Mikel, Abby, don't hang up.
Oh, great, my biggest fan.
look, I know we got off on the wrong foot.
the wrong foot?!
the only right foot is my foot up your...
Abby, Abby, listen.
I need to see you.
you really are insane.
if you just trust me,
I promise nothing will happen to you.
and if I don't, what?
you're gonna tear up that nice collage you were making for me?
let's just say you're not as safe as you think you are.
MAWHER: Abby, somebody tried to kill you in your own lab.
you're not safe in there.
Oh, and let me guess, you're the only person who protect me?
see? You're starting to understand, that's good.
kind of like that time somebody broke into my house and stole my mail?
Yeah, that was pretty scary, huh?
Yeah. And that crazy freak that kept slashing my tires.
I-I was really worried about you then, Ab.
mikel, that was you!
you slashed my tires!
you stole my mail!
what does any of that matter, as long as it made you realize you know, your true feelings for me, Ab? Huh?
no, no, no, try using the S.I.D. instead of the ESN for registration request.
that's a good idea.
Hey.
Abby, down! He's right there!
he's here, McGee, on the move.
McGee: MPs on scene, Tony.
are you okay? No!
clear!
clear. Ziva! Lock down the yard.
no one in or out. We'll find him, Abby.
well, then I can't stay here, Gibbs!
definitely not staying at McGee's place.
no place is safe!
if he can get to me on the navy yard, he can get to me anywhere! Not anywhere.
not anywhere.
nothing like a nice, quiet, dungeon-like basement to calm the nerves.
you need to sleep, Abby.
I know. I tried.
every time I close my eyes, I see Mikel.
with the grain.
I thought I was.
Yeah, I don't understand why people drink alcohol when they're depressed.
because alcohol is a depressant.
and now I'm still depressed.
and I'm nauseous.
and really drunk.
which means that, tomorrow, I have to go fight a hangover while I'm in court, while some ambulance-chasing attorney tries to attack my credibility.
what is wrong with me, Gibbs?
what did I do to deserve this?
it's not about you, Abby.
it's about him.
then why do I feel so guilty?
I don't know. Why do you?
because...
I think this might all be my fault.
maybe it is.
how could you say that to me, Gibbs?
I didn't do anything wrong.
just because some defective lunatic can't get it through his thick skull that I think he is a defective lunatic.
that is not my fault... Gibbs!
that's not my fault at all.
this is not my fault.
it's not my fault.
hmm.
I see why you like to work on your boat, Gibbs.
very, very cathartic.
Oops.
suddenly, having a stalker on the loose isn't so scary.
he's not on the loose, Abby.
that's what I came down here to tell you.
DiNozzo called.
the Coast Guard picked up Mikel Mawher trying to cross the Anacostia.
this is harassment, okay?! I'm gonna file a restraining order against your whole department!
knock yourself out.
they did wonders for me.
it's over, Abby.
not until he finds another loophole to crawl out of.
he will. You don't know him.
SHEPARD: No.
but I know Gibbs.
excuse me, Director.
the federal marshal is here for Abby.
just when it was getting good.
judges don't like to be kept waiting.
let me know how it turns out.
don't worry.
Gibbs won't let him crawl out of anything.
MAWHER: You guys have it all wrong.
I'm not the one trying to hurt Abby.
Tony: No, you're just the misunderstood lover who flies in at the last second to be her savior.
is that how the game's played?
this isn't a game.
okay? I'm trying to protect Abby, here.
you have an interesting way of showing it.
no choice-- it's the only way I can get her to listen to me.
Abby and I have gone through a rough patch lately.
Hey! There is no Abby and you.
rough patches don't usually include cyanide.
that wasn't me.
I didn't even know Abby was in trouble till after you came to my office.
look, I'm not the one trying to hurt Abby.
but I know who is.
not his name, but his picture.
right there.
after you guys came to see me,
I started to go through all my old photos.
exhibits A through G of you violating your restraining order?
it's not illegal if I stand more than 100 yards away.
it is if you harass, follow or threaten.
that's semantics. Okay?
anyway, I'm going through all my old photos, and the same guy kept popping up over and over again.
that's gotta be your guy.
right there, him. That scary guy right there.
that scary guy?
the really scary guy, right there?
no, no, the other guy.
zoom in on the other guy. Yeah.
MAWHER: Keep going. Keep going.
keep rolling. You see what I'm saying?
I wasn't the only one following her.
the only reason I was able to worm into Abby's computer and hack onto her drive in the first place, 'cause somebody else had already cracked the authentication protocols before me.
thanks for the lift.
I could really use it, after the week I've had.
don't forget your seatbelt.
he's right, boss-- Mawher's worm didn't penetrate Abby's system until after the authentication calls were cracked.
who cracked them?
that's gonna take some time.
we don't have time.
that was the federal marshal who was supposed to pick up Abby.
supposed to?
someone slashed the tires on his transport.
he hasn't left yet.
...so I guess the lesson is to always trust your instincts, you know?
like with you, you scare me.
so we could never date.
but don't feel bad.
I mean, you're a federal agent.
you should scare people.
that's your job.
no answer on her cell phone.
running a trace.
state police have been notified.
ZIVA: Still no answer, Gibbs.
keep trying.
how far could he have gotten?
far enough.
he knows his window's small.
McGee, I'm not gonna ask again!
McGee: Location's coming up.
sending GPS coordinates to your PDA.
okay, I got it!
Tony: This can't be right. It says we're right on top of her.
that's because we are.
I'll be with you in a minute, Gibbs!
and don't look up my skirt!
okay.
Tony: So how'd it go? ABBY: Horrible.
the judge ruled all of my physical evidence inadmissible.
then threw out the case.
hit you hard, huh?
actually, no. She didn't bring up my bad taste in men.
she attacked the science.
it was always about the science.
I only questioned you on the restraining order to throw the prosecution off my real game plan.
Human-scent detection is a viable forensic tool.
which has yet to be fully vetted and peer-approved.
lucky for me.
scent evidence is the only physical evidence tying the defendant to the money he took?
we're saying you're a very smelly man.
Hey, I was proven innocent, remember?
actually, you just weren't found guilty.
there's a difference.
I'll keep that in mind while I'm getting a tan on the beaches of Bora-Bora.
stevenson: Don't take it so hard.
I knew it was going to end like this right from the very beginning.
too bad your client didn't.
excuse me?
Yeah, you should have trusted your lawyer, there, giggle man.
instead of spending all of that money hiring a hit man to take out the star witness,
aka me.
what are they talking about?
I have no idea.
you paid him to kill.
you didn't pay him to keep his mouth shut.
Yeah.
Tony: That dude even gave you credit for staging the bloodbath at the Navy Lodge.
you guys think you're so smart.
Terry, don't say a word.
McGee: Back in the car, let's go.
I was right, wasn't I, huh?
that's right, Abby would be dead right now, if it wasn't for me.
that what you think?
I think Terry Spooner never would have gotten as close as he did without you as a distraction, and that real danger here was you.
no, no. People accuse me of playing mind games. No.
metro cops found your car.
they found the gun.
found the suicide note you wrote in Abby's handwriting.
that was just a last resort.
I love her.
I love her, you know?
you don't get it, do you? Huh?
she wants everybody to believe that she doesn't love me.
hell, I even think she even believes it sometimes.
tell you what, if you don't care about me, then how come she can't take your eyes off me right now?
huh?
you can lie to the rest of the world, you can't lie to your heart.
can you, Abby?
no, no, no.
no, no, no, no.
look, I know you're in there!
sorry, Caitlin.
l am so sorry.
why me, Gibbs?
wasn't stopping one bullet enough for you?
why did l have to take two?
l don't know.
you don't know?
come on, Gibbs, what's that famous gut tell you?
why did l die instead of you?
found Ari's sniper's nest, boss.
roof of an abandoned office building to the east.
didn't police his brass.
they're Lapua . 308s.
l didn't mean that you couldn't see that, boss.
l can't without my glasses.
Lapua's match-grade sniper ammo.
you guys find any bullets?
none that match the casings.
l left three guys on the roof searching.
McGee and l will go back to the roof, boss.
Tony, you're soaking wet.
go put some dry clothes on.
Ari's rooftop wasn't much higher than ours.
Rooflines behind us were lower.
no telling how far a full metal jacket bullet would go, after killing Kate.
how's he know it's a full metal jacket?
didn't you see Kate?
l didn't want to.
her head was intact.
Oh, so she didn't look bad?
no. No, not at all, Probie.
ln fact, a little mortuary putty right here and she'll be good as new.
of course, she was having a bad hair day, though, right back here.
a full metal jacket will put a hole the size of a grapefruit - right about there. - Tony.
please. Sorry, kid.
three rounds. Only one hit?
he must've popped off a couple rounds when we were weaving across the roof.
l was standing still when Kate was shot.
McGee lasered the distance at nearly 600 metres.
five seventy-two.
slight shift in the wind, he misses you. He hits Kate.
there was no wind.
what are you saying? He was aiming at Kate?
you're the one he wants to kill. - Ari had a thing for Kate.
what are you talking about?
she told me that he was always coming on to her. ln Autopsy, when he kidnapped her and let her go.
she never told me that.
gee, what a surprise. - What?
don't do that, Tony.
when was this hit, Tim?
when l was pinned down.
Ari have a shot at it?
a car was between the terrorist and the controller.
there's no way he could have hit it.
l'm sorry. l should've realized that it was Ari.
why didn't he pop McGee? - Oh, thanks, Tony.
all l'm saying is you're a sizeable target. The controller isn't.
are you saying l'm fat? - No.
all right, maybe a little around the waist, under the chin.
he didn't have an angle on Tim.
you owe that shooter from the warehouse a thank-you.
he saved your life.
the bullet entered here. lt could have ricocheted into the car.
l'll-- l'll get on it.
Abby should be in by now. - Tony, see what you can pull off that brass.
l'm going for coffee. Can l get you boys some?
no. - No, thanks.
that's a first.
he called me Tim. - He patted my back.
lt's kind of nice.
nice?
l don't want nice. He's not Gibbs if he's nice.
you're a mess, girl.
red eyes. No makeup.
lf ever there was a time for black lipstick, it's now.
remember when we first met?
l couldn't believe you were a forensic scientist.
l thought goths had bats for pets or vice-versa.
l really liked you, Kate.
a lot.
don't start that again. Where are your pigtails?
l love you in pigtails.
that's better.
you were persistent, Abs.
first, the dark lipstick. Then the black nail polish.
next thing you know, l have a tat on my bum.
Oh, God. Ducky's gonna see it.
l'm dead and l'm embarrassed.
are you okay?
l will be as soon as l tie up my pigtails.
there.
what can l do for you?
what? - You're weirder than Gibbs.
how so?
he's being nice.
Gibbs is always nice.
to you and Ducky, maybe.
me, he growls at and smacks on the head.
which makes you feel wanted.
Yeah.
what do you got for me?
.308 casings from Ari's sniper's nest.
you would have to give me the most popular calibre in the world.
well, hey, l just found them.
can you tell what weapon he used?
a . 308. - What model . 308?
you don't know? - Would l be asking?
well, how am l supposed to know? - Because you're the firearms expert.
that l am.
and when l'm done, l will tell you the propellant, the primer, the percentage of nickel and copper in the brass, whether or not all three rounds were fired from the same weapon which you assume, but l can prove or disprove.
l will tell you who manufactured the ammo, the batch number and, perhaps, where it was sold.
l will also, with some degree of accuracy, tell you if it was fired from a lever-action, a bolt-action, a semi-automatic or an automatic weapon.
however, there is no way in hell l could tell you which of the 87 different . 308 models fired those rounds.
the rounds are Lapua.
what?
Lapua made the ammo.
logo's on the rim.
Tony, l'm gonna miss her.
me too.
you hit? - No.
you're heavy. - Sorry.
no wonder you're so heavy. Tony, you're all muscle.
ABBY:
packing a nice booty too.
Hey, is this how you deal with getting shot at?
l don't know. lt's my first time. - Abby.
boss, down. We're taking fire.
are you okay? - Yeah.
close off Anacostia Park between the bridges.
tell Metro cops it's a crime scene. - Okay, right.
what if he has a night-vision scope?
that's a good point, boss.
l will get you bullet-proof glass.
there's no such thing, Gibbs. - Okay, bullet-resistant glass.
Ari didn't shoot at you and hit Kate by mistake, did he?
he's after me now.
l was walking by that window when he fired.
you're just saying that to make me feel safe.
l'll keep you safe, Abby.
l promise.
l appreciate your keeping me covered in front of the others.
especially Tony.
Yes, l know how modest you are.
were.
l'm dead now, Ducky.
shouldn't be.
l could have killed Ari right here. ln Autopsy.
why did you hesitate?
his eyes.
there was something in his eyes that made me not wanna kill him.
his eyes were ice to me.
Ari fired into Abby's lab.
good Lord.
lt had to come from across the river in Anacostia Park.
was Abigail hurt?
no, she's a little shook up. Tony's with her.
ln the lab?
ln the squad room writing up an incident report.
you should have brought in another M. E. Duck.
couldn't.
not for Caitlin.
l've lost men in combat.
you hope you won't. You know you will.
this is different. - But it shouldn't be.
Kate was an agent.
she knew she had to lay her life on the line.
but you're right.
lt's different.
well, you just said it.
you've lost men. Have you ever lost a woman?
let's face it, Jethro, you and l are a couple of old chauvinists.
women will never be equal in our eyes until they're equal in death.
why, Ducky?
why Kate? Why not me?
well, maybe he meant to hit you. - No.
no, him sniping Abby means he's after my people.
women first.
then he's torturing you.
one has to wonder what made him such a sadist.
l don't give a damn.
l just wanna kill the bastard.
Hey, McGee, take a look at this.
l think it's a . 308.
stop staring at my butt and get me an evidence jar.
drop it.
Oh, l found another one.
boss, we found a . 308 slug.
two. They were plugged in the trunk.
these fired by the dirtbag in the warehouse?
Yes. Those l found in the right side of the car. Nine mil slugs.
Ari missed with his first shot. Hit the controller with the second.
where were you before you took cover?
right here.
Tony's right. You do owe that terrorist a thank-you.
he didn't police his brass again.
metro P. D. found a . 308 casing in the park next to tyre tracks.
And? - Nothing.
l was waiting for you to tell me to tell them to bring the evidence.
l have to tell you that, DiNozzo?
you always do.
tell Metro P. D. to-- - Already did, boss.
Oh, and by the way, the director wants to see you up in MTAC.
why are you baiting Gibbs?
l'm trying to get him to stop being nice.
l like him nice.
signal is strong. We have a solid channel.
distributing the infrared
what do you have?
brass from Ari's sniper's nest. Three bullets.
tyre tracks in Anacostia Park from where he fired a shot across the river into our forensics lab.
unusual for a sniper not to police his brass, isn't it?
Yes, sir. - l've received calls from every director l know promising to hunt down this sniper as if he'd killed one of their own.
FBl might be the most help. Ari Haswari is their mole.
l endorsed your recommendation to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Special Agent Todd.
thank you, sir. - According to your after-action report, no one actually saw the sniper who killed Agent Todd.
Ari was on a rooftop 600 metres away.
extraordinary shot. - No, sir. Not really.
you were a sniper with the Corps? - Two tours.
Vietnam?
l'm not that old, sir.
panama and Desert Storm.
l thought you were older. - Target vehicle approaching.
we have a hard lock.
target confirmed. Engage.
weapon free.
good lock. On target.
well done.
good job, everyone.
where was l?
avoiding using Ari's name and the word " sniper " in the same sentence, sir.
your anger is understandable, Jethro. You lost an agent.
you want payback. - Don't you, sir?
lt's a passion l can't afford.
do you honestly think it wasn't Ari?
no. But there are those who do.
those who ran him.
those who thought they had the holy grail of moles.
those people covering their asses right now.
make sure you cover yours when you bring him in.
won't be a problem, sir.
l won't be bringing him in.
anyway, you're not my problem anymore, Jethro.
you firing me, sir?
l've been offered a deputy director's position at Homeland Security.
you'd leave NClS, sir?
well, the agency could use some younger blood.
well, who'll be replacing you, sir?
not me.
much as l like you, Jethro, l would not shoot NClS in the head.
he's your problem now, director.
Hello, Jethro.
should we skip the " you haven't changed a bit " bull?
why start lying to each other now, Jen?
any problem taking orders from me?
as director or as a woman?
either.
lt was six years ago.
the past won't be a problem.
you were a damn good agent especially undercover.
madam Director.
you have no physical evidence linking Ari to the shootings.
no wonder agencies here and abroad have doubts.
bastard killed one of my people. He's trying to kill more.
l'll tell you something else. No suit with a tight sphincter is getting in my way, and that includes you, Jen.
special Agent Gibbs.
on the job, it is Director Shepard or ma'am.
okay. What about off the job?
there won't be any " off the job, " Agent Gibbs.
that's too bad.
l missed you, Jen.
don't make this difficult, Jethro.
fair enough. lt won't happen again.
director.
we can continue this conversation in private.
l've gotta change my clothes. We can talk in my car.
Gibbs. - Hey, l got a dead agent and a sniper on the loose. l do not have 1 0 minutes to spare.
Tony, where are we?
McGee and Abby are working firearms analysis.
l'm matching tyre tracks to vehicles. - No one is to leave the building.
McGee's on protection detail with Abby. l'll be back in an hour.
your mother should have washed your mind out with soap.
Gibbs leaves with a woman and your only thought is: nooner.
was not.
was too.
l've always known what you were thinking, Tony.
what? What are you up to?
Tony, l just died and you're having a sexual fantasy?
can't help it.
sometimes l used to picture you naked.
l'll call you back.
l was just
having phone sex?
phone sex? No.
charades. - Charades?
like: -You've played.
never on the telephone.
Yeah.
my partner and l were coming up with quotes for Saturday night.
you play charades on Saturday night?
to kill time before l go clubbing. Who are you?
Mossad.
you're lsraeli?
very good. The way you made that connection.
Mossad, lsraeli.
what can l do for you, Ms. David?
nothing. l'm here to see Special Agent Gibbs.
how do you know l'm not Gibbs?
Gibbs. - He'll be back in an hour.
are you sure l can't help you?
l don't think so.
we got off to a bad start.
l'm Special Agent Tony DiNozzo. l wasn't playing charades.
l was remembering my partner.
naked? - No.
Yes. l
l was just
look, l'm not the only man who does it.
Oh, women do it too.
with handsome men.
and even an occasional woman.
now you're teasing me.
didn't your partner tease you?
not about sex. Kate was kind of puritanical.
sorry. - Well, it didn't matter.
l wasn't interested in her. We were partners.
she wasn't attractive?
she was, but not to me.
then why did you imagine her naked?
miss David, you can sit there and slouch provocatively for an hour if you'd like, or you could tell me what you need and maybe l can help.
you can't help because l'm here to stop Special Agent Gibbs from killing a Mossad officer.
Ari Haswari?
Yes.
l'd wish you luck, but l want the bastard dead too.
ls this the same boat you were building six years ago?
Nope. - What happened to it?
l burned her. - Why would you--?
you named it after an ex-wife.
let's go.
which one? - You know damn well which one.
why didn't you change the name? - Because it wouldn't matter.
every time l went out on her, l'd think of Diane.
you could have sold it.
and watched some other guy sail off on her?
you didn't care who sailed off on Diane.
you are a strange man.
me.
you were a good agent, Jen.
were? - Yeah.
director's job is pure politics.
l'm good at politics.
NClS needs someone who can shake the money tree on the Hill and work with sister agencies.
wait, you won't call a boat a " she, " but it's " sister agencies? "
l'm a schizoid libber.
lt comes from working with chauvinists like you.
l can't believe you would give up field work for rubber chicken dinners.
l don't think they serve that dish at Palena.
never heard of it. - Why would you? lt isn't takeout.
so which of the tight sphincters is taking you out to dinner?
please tell me it's not Fornell.
cbs Early Show.
they want background before l go on TV.
Jen. Jen, you can't do that.
excuse me?
Ari is a chauvinist.
he is taking out the women l work with before me.
people who should know don't believe Ari Haswari is the sniper.
and you haven't provided any evidence to prove them wrong.
have you ever doubted me?
professionally? Never.
why are you doubting me now?
l have to establish a working relationship with these people.
who are you gonna side with, Jen? Them or me.
give me a tough question.
what is with this music?
l'm playing it out of respect for Kate.
l thought you were from New Orleans.
so? - Well, don't they play jazz at funerals?
coming from the cemetery after the body has been buried.
on the way to the cemetery, we play a dirge.
do you know what a dirge is, Timmy? - Creepy music?
go back to the squad room and let me do my job.
l can't.
Why?
Gibbs-- Gibbs told me to watch over you.
that is so sweet.
you're from a wealthy family. - Really?
born and raised on the East Coast. New England boarding school.
spent some time in the Midwest. And Philadelphia.
how would you know that?
shalom, Jen.
shalom.
did l miss it?
Yes, you did, but we didn't. - You first.
Ziva David, Mossad.
she's here to stop you from whacking Ari. Yours?
director Jenny Shepard. Same mission.
which agency?
ours.
yeah?
special Agent Gibbs.
Ziva David, Mossad.
director Shepard has spoken often of you.
Really? - Ziva and l worked antiterrorist ops since 91 1 . you saw one today in MTAC.
that was yours?
l only acquired the intel.
excuse me.
Yes, l really am the new NClS director.
good to have you back, boss.
shalom.
miss David, whose balls get cut off if Ari is not a Mossad mole, but a terrorist?
mine, l suppose. Since l'm his control officer.
they promote control officers young in Mossad.
have to. The good ones are dead at your age.
do you know how l located Ari's terrorist cell?
GPS fix off his encrypted cell phone.
he wanted you to know the terrorists' location, so you could stop the missile instead of him, which would've blown his cover.
only an NSA satellite can GPS an encrypted phone.
Ari didn't know l had that asset.
you give him less credit than he gives you.
who hung up first? You or him?
Ari knows a fix takes only 1 9 seconds.
when Sharon visited Bush, Ari's Hamas cell kidnapped Agent Todd.
why didn't he kill her instead of freeing her to warn the Secret Service?
why don't you arrange a meet and he can tell me?
Ari Haswari is a Mossad operative undercover in Hamas.
he hasn't turned on us or you. He didn't kill Agent Todd.
Gibbs, even if you're right, we owe them proof.
that's all we ask.
don't kill the wrong man. - Like Mossad did in Norway?
that mistake cost us dearly.
not as dearly as the Palestinian waiter you killed.
Ziva, assure your deputy director that even though Ari Haswari is a suspect, no action will be taken unless we have evidentiary proof.
proof before action.
you were my sweet superhero, Kate.
you're a naughty boy, Timmy.
Oh, my God. l'm becoming Tony.
wow, what?
l-- l
stop " ah-uming, " McGee. Spit it out.
l-- l was thinking about Kate.
me too.
l kind of still feel like she's here, you know?
l want you on Ziva's ass.
she's not really my type, boss.
to tail her. - l knew that.
she's been in contact with Ari.
that's the only way she could know l hung up on him.
l don't want you to get pissed-- - l thought you wanted me pissed?
l did. lt was kind of weird when you were being nice.
not that you're not nice. l mean
will you spit it out, DiNozzo?
what if Ziva's right and Ari knew you'd trace the call?
maybe he wasn't the sniper.
she is right.
Ari wanted me to raid the warehouse.
he set me up. And it cost Kate her life.
ls he a mole or a terrorist?
whatever works to play his game.
lf Ziva leads me to Ari?
shadow him and call me.
so you can bring him in? - Yeah. So l can bring him in to Autopsy.
the FBl database gave me six weapons whose rifling patterns fit the bullets you recovered.
l've been able to eliminate all but three.
two SWAT weapons, the Tango 51 and Bravo 51 .
and this-- - My old friend.
a Marine M40A1 sniper rifle.
lt looks sweet the way you hold that, boss.
sweet?
Yeah. lt's an expression that means
Yeah, l know what it means, McGee.
you think Ari looked sweet when he shot Kate?
of course not, boss.
my vote is for the Tango or Bravo 51 s.
what do you think, Gibbs?
your test rounds show more gouging than Ari's.
he was hand loading and moly coating.
you are so good.
moly coating " ? - Yeah.
molybdenum disulfide. lt's a lubricant.
lt decreases barrel wear and increases accuracy.
McGee, run a trace on Tango and Bravo 51 sales.
last six weeks. Tri-state area.
check the Bravo first. - On it, boss.
any prints on the brass?
no.
ls your gut telling you something?
Yeah. l need coffee.
no, Gibbs. Come on.
this isn't just another investigation.
Todd was your agent, but Kate was my friend.
so can you stop it with the John Wayne stare - and tell me what your gut says? - What don't l believe in, Abby?
ufos, mystics, coincidence, saying you're sorry, excuses. l could go on all night.
as a Marine sniper, l used hand-loaded Lapua . 308 boat-tail full metal jacket, moly-coated bullets.
you know what a sniper calls a Bravo 51 ?
no.
a Kate.
my shoulder hurts when it rains, too, Gerald.
good night, Kate.
autopsy.
Hello, Dr. Mallard.
Gerald. How are you, my dear fellow?
l've been better.
Oh, what's wrong? - He's having flashbacks.
well, who are you? - Oh, l'm hurt.
you don't recognise my voice?
you bastard.
you do remember me.
lf you harm Gerald
l have no intention of harming Gerald.
l think one ruined shoulder is enough.
lt certainly is for me.
what do you want?
a professional courtesy, one doctor to another.
Yes, well, l'd be most willing to provide a free autopsy.
Dr. Mallard, l want to prove l didn't kill Caitlin.
by taking Gerald hostage?
gerald is free to go if you'll listen - to my side of this tragedy. - l'm listening.
lt's a long story and l'd hate to have somebody trace this call.
well, no one is here but me.
and Caitlin.
lt must have been a difficult autopsy for you.
l'm truly sorry, doctor.
will you get on with it?
will you meet me alone?
what happens to Gerald?
come alone and you can exchange places.
doctor, don't come. He'll kill you.
learn to trust, Gerald.
l may have shot you in the shoulder.
but l've never lied to you. Doctor?
you have my word.
thank you.
re-evaluating your convictions?
how many times did you tell me there's no such thing as a coincidence?
l know it's been a difficult day for both of us.
that's what my Dl used to say.
never believed him.
are you going to dinner with CBS?
l am.
don't do that interview.
please.
l'll see if l can delay it a few days.
good.
good night, Jethro.
night.
Ducky. How nice to see you again.
and you. Congratulations.
going home? - Yes.
so are you back at work, Gerald?
next week.
l've always found that work is the best
a vintage Morgan.
how Ducky.
flash your lights.
roll down your window.
now wait in the good doctor's car while we talk.
I did.
that's fairly obvious.
for your information, that's my knee.
whatever.
you can get off me now.
it's only been ten minutes.
I have a reputation to protect.
we're not even sure if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.
you can't be too careful when you're undercover.
let's give it another 40 minutes just to be realistic.
realistic, huh? Mm-hmm.
in that case...
I prefer it on top.
I can live with that.
what was that for?
because that was definitely not your knee.
mm, she's very beautiful, Jethro.
her name's Sophie Ranier.
she's murdered over 25 people, Duck.
and her friend?
her husband
both Canadian citizens.
both contract assassins.
she suffered extensive injuries.
it may take quite a while to determine the actual cause of death.
they were killed in a car accident two days ago outside of Kuwait International Airport.
there's the accident report.
I'm assuming this is urgent.
I've waited three months to see Giselle.
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend, doc, but I do need you...
Giselle's a ballet.
you really should get out of your basement more, Jethro.
we need to know everything we can about these two, Ducky.
why is NCIS investigating this?
marine CID found two fake U. S. passports and two first-class tickets for Washington, DC, in their luggage.
they have reservations at the Barclay through November 10.
marine Corps birthday.
they're holding the ball there.
hosted by the commandant of the Marine Corps.
our top military leaders congressmen, and agency directors will be there.
including me.
GIBBS: Tony and Ziva have taken their room reservations at the Barclay.
they're there now pretending to be these two.
they're working blind, Duck.
we're counting on you to fill them in on some of the more personal details of our couple.
though it may be common knowledge that I talk to my patients, unfortunately, to date, none of them have ever answered me back.
listen harder.
sweetheart, you know what I could really use right now?
some deodorant?
I was thinking more along the lines of a back massage.
good idea.
why don't you roll over like a good boy.
and to think my mother thought I was too good for you.
What'd I miss?
they had sex.
they have any contact with anyone yet?
just each other.
multiple times.
was it good for you?
wait. Someone's knocking at their door.
ZIVA: Who is it?
man: Room service.
room service.
compliments of the hotel management.
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room for bugs...
place some of our own.
and he also wants to talk to you.
you can put it over there, please.
very good, ma'am.
ZIVA: Garcon, we'd like some extra bath towels.
McGee: Of course.
just checking to make sure everything's in order.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
ZIVA: Oh, and can you check the minibar?
I'd like it restocked with Redull.
red Bull.
that'll keep you up all night, ma'am.
exactly.
please accept this assortment of cheeses, compliments of the hotel.
what's wrong?
room service put a tray on our microphone.
you know what that means.
we're screwed?
Nope. You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.
: if you whisper, it should be okay.
comfortable, DiNozzo?
well, yeah, working on it. Why do you ask?
we're looking at you, Agent DiNozzo.
all of you.
uh, sorry about that.
DiNozzo, what the hell are you doing?
you're married assassins.
you're not visiting the Playboy mansion.
it was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.
incoming call.
have her answer it.
sweet cheeks, do you think you could go over and answer the phone for me while I pour us some champagne?
Thanks, honey.
Yes.
there's a cell phone in the Bible next to your bed.
got it.
keep it with you at all times.
you have dinner reservations at the hotel dining room at 9: 00.
don't be late.
the concierge.
we were able to get into the dining room after all...
my love.
it looks like I'm getting dressed up for you tonight.
that wasn't the concierge.
that was their contact.
we're on the move.
let's go. We've got to get dressed for dinner.
I'm going.
ABBY: Don't look at me that way, Gibbs.
it was league night when I got your 911.
I was two frames away from a perfect score.
and just for the record, these stupid outfits were not my idea.
I like it.
is is kind of cute, huh?
no sign of Mr. Palmer, I suppose?
not since this afternoon, Ducky.
ABS, these are their personal effects.
get yourself wired so you can feed whatever you find directly to DiNozzo and David.
looking for anything in particular?
Yeah, anything that will help those two act like them.
solid on the visuals, Tony.
Tony: There's quite a crowd here tonight.
see anyone you know, sweet cheeks?
not yet.
but the night's just getting started, my little hairy butt.
ABS. I'm loading the photos into the computer.
duck, u got any scoop for our married couple?
I have the breakdown of the contents of their stomachs and intestines.
if Mr. Ranier had lived,
I would have suggested a more fiber-rich diet.
his colon was almost impacted with fecal material.
you think it's too late to order a salad?
good evening.
table for two?
ZIVA: I believe oufood is here now.
thank you.
bon appetit, mon petit pois.
report.
got the restaurant covered from the entrance, boss.
I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
Tony, the calluses on Mr. Ranier's hand suggest he was left-handed.
GIBBS: Switch hands, DiNozzo.
this is nice, isn't it?
Yeah, a quiet little dinner
just the six of us.
our friend is calling.
ABS, I want that number.
got it.
starting a reverse search directory now.
ZIVA: I'm glad you called.
we were getting bored.
thought it would help to see your target in person tonight.
he's here?
you don't see him?
relax.
I've been flying for over 20 hours.
and the restaurant's packed. We will.
talk to me, Abs.
he's calling from a pay phone.
the address is coming up.
you didn't mention anything about being surrounded by U. S. Marines.
it's too dangerous for the sum you're paying us.
accomplish your mission, and we'll discuss more.
but you won't pay us more.
ABBY: Got it!
2205 M Street.
he's calling from a pay phone inside the restaurant.
GIBBS: DiNozzo, McGee! Already moving.
I have to go to the little boy's room.
I have to talk to my boss.
do that. We'll wait for you to...
he hung up.
don't move. Federal agent.
it's me, Probie. He's gone.
must have slipped out through the kitchen.
I didn't even get a look.
want us back in the squad room, boss?
no, I want you and Ziva back in your room maintaining your cover.
Oh. All night?
do I stutter or something, DiNozzo?
afraid I'll bite, Tony?
the name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.
Hey, Abs, what do you got?
I have a "whoopee" and I have a "but.
Whoopee-- I got a photo of the man that Tony and Ziva are going to assassinate
But?
but...
I have no idea which of these 32 photos is him.
what makes you think the target's a male?
did you forget I'll be there?
no, whoever set up the hit referred to the caller as a man.
you made contact?
Ziva got a pay phone call.
you trace it?
gee, why didn't I think of that?
sorry, Jethro. I'm a little tired.
Yeah, well, you never could pace yourself very well.
I have one word for you, Jethro.
Mm?
Positano.
come on.
that was a week after I took a bullet.
where did the call originate?
pay phone, the hotel.
we got there, the guy was gone.
SHEPHARD: At least we know he's here keeping tabs on the operation.
Abby's matching these photos with reservations in the restaurant.
she'll check the names against invites to the ball.
it'll narrow the target.
what if the hit has nothing to do with the ball?
someone who's a guest at the hotel?
Ziva told him she didn't know the target would be surrounded by Marines.
and he wasn't surprised.
no.
Hey, nothing's going to happen tonight.
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack, all the backup teams are in place around the hotel.
why don't you go grab 40 on the couch in your office?
no, I just need a little coffee.
yeah? When the caffeine jolt ends?
I'll do what you do.
get a refill.
you're not me.
chauvinist.
Yeah.
yeah... I guess.
good night, Jen.
Uh-huh?
need to boce something off you.
okay, shoot.
my director side is telling me flood that hotel with security and notify the FBI of a potential terrorist attack.
my agent side?
if I do that, we lose the chance to take down an enemy cell operating inside the capitol.
they'll scatter.
of course, you'd stay the course, trust your people to get the job done.
you telling me what I'd do?
asking.
if I was director, I'd give my people another 24.
they can't get the job done,
I'd notify the FBI.
you'd really do that?
Nah. But that's why I'll never be director.
the man snores like a drunken sailor.
well, we won't have to listen much longer.
he saw their target at the restaurant.
we're on plan.
watched the videotape of their session this afternoon, Maya.
it was pretty hot stuff.
these two really know how to live their life.
you, uh, you ever think about that maybe...?
forget it. We're here on a mission, period.
you want something more than coffee, call room service.
Oh, my God.
Ziva? Shh...
come on, you're killing me here.
what?
nothing. I thought I heard something.
crazy chick.
ZIVA: I heard that, my little hairy butt.
morning, boss.
thank you.
Hey, boss, this was sitting on my front porch this morning.
what is it?
it's a package addressed to Ziva.
well, yeah, I can see that, McGee.
what is in it?
wasn't sure if I should open it.
that's probably why she's using you as her mule.
sunglasses.
with different lenses?
Why?
to protect her eyes?
you know, I'm going to ask her.
I'm going to find out.
Yeah, good idea, McGee.
give 'em their wake-up call.
McGee: Tony? Mm.
Hey, DiNozzo!
this is great.
they're sleeping in a five-star hotel, I'm a waiter.
ZIVA: Want to trade places, McGee?
you're awake.
since 5.
he snores.
I've got a package here for you.
my shades.
can you bring them up with breakfast?
sure. Gibbs wants Tony up, too.
huh, my pleasure.
Jean-Paul, my little furry bear.
wake up, cheri.
I'm in position, boss!
DUCKY: Make the stitches precise, Mr. Palmer.
uh, yes, Doctor.
and when you're done,
I want the supply locker inventoried and cleaned.
I, uh, actually, already did that, Doctor.
then do it again.
what have we found out, Duck?
that my assistant, Mr. Palmer here, should keep his cell phone with him and turned on at all times.
what can you tell me about our assassins?
Mr. Ranier here had his appendix removed,
Mrs. had her left wrist broken as a child.
we did, however, find some rather curious markings.
markings?
well, tattoos might be the more appropriate word.
almost invisible to the naked eye.
on the inside of the fourth digit of both of their left hands.
or the sign for infinity.
some kind of terrorist cell I. D?
DUCKY: On their ring fingers.
perhaps it means "love forever.
you know, I want to take another look at the X rays, make sure I didn't miss anything else.
Yeah, do it.
missed a stitch there, Palmer.
we really should take you to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.
Why's that?
because you snore like a drunken sailor with emphysema.
look who's calling the pot black.
kettle. Pot is calling the kettle black.
Oh, I'd really like some music.
something with a little beat, dear?
sorry.
what do we got?
mm, sneaky people.
top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs.
they have a laser trained on our room.
I can't believe that your sunglasses can detect different light spectrums.
Ziva, that is amazing.
DiNozzo, we're going to need a diversion.
I think we can manage something, boss.
let's roll, McGee.
Ziva, that is amazing.
big whoop, she has spy glasses.
anyone can do that. That's not amazing.
ZIVA: You realize we can still hear you, right, Abby?
I think I'm going to need a cold shower after this.
disgusting.
give me those binoculars.
I don't know how much longer...
I can ep this up, boss.
we're in pition, DiNozzo.
give it the big finish.
we could make a fortune with this off the Internet.
they're serial killers, Yussif.
I wouldn't recommend trying.
NCIS! FBI, freeze!
I got a whole new respect for NCIS, Agent McGee.
you guys are hard-core.
Ah, we got lucky.
it's actually the trained laser on the room that gave you away.
we were talking about your agents pretending to be married assassins.
very convincing.
I don't think anyone in the FBI would actually go all the way just to sell a cover story.
I would.
guys, they were acting.
trust me...
I know when someone's acting when they're having sex.
it's true
I'v meet his wife.
well, Tony and Ziva wouldn't.
...unusual for men to like love stories.
how do I explain to the director of the FBI that we're running an undercover op in his jurisdiction without informing him.
with a smile.
it's not funny, Gibbs.
they had intel that two assassins were going to hit a target at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
did you get that memo?
no.
why didn't I think of that?
because you're exhausted.
I told you-- get some sleep.
and do that before you take on the director of the FBI.
I can't, Jethro.
I can fix this.
how?
you're not the only one around here knows how to play politics.
you're not serious.
your idea of politics usually involves some form of physical violence.
well, you know what they say, Jen...
can't make an omelet unless you break a few eggs.
are we free to go now?
not yet.
what the hell's NCIS doing... Our job, Fornell.
Yeah, that involve jeopardizing our operation?
you're damn lucky we didn't blow these two away.
which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction!
conference room... now!
so anxious to play with the big boys...
GIBBS: Really? Big boys, my ass!
Yeah, this is going to be ugly.
Oh, yeah. Fornell hasn't been this upset since...
the last time we saw him.
gum?
the big boys?
we really screwed this one up.
Oh, you think, Tobias?
the question is, how do we fix it without our directors getting into a world-class pissing match?
joint op.
who's lead?
my team's already in place.
did you find out who hired them?
not yet. Working on it.
I need more than that for my tap dance at the Hoover Building.
give us 24 hours, then we flip.
I gets operational control?
Yeah, and credit for the collar.
agreed.
directors get to save face and we...
get the job done.
and people say we're bastards?
only because they know us.
I've got the I. D.'s on the people in the restaurant who have invites to the Marine Corps Ball, ma'am.
uh, Abby.
sorry.
make sure Tony and Ziva get 'em.
okay. Should I also check restaurant staff, too?
international assassins hired to take out a waiter?
I was just trying to be thorough.
no...
it's good.
good instincts, Chip. Run 'em.
okay.
Hey, Abby, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
why don't you like Officer David?
what makes you think I don't like her?
uh, I found this.
Oh... that.
I understand.
I have the same problem with DiNozzo.
Tony is a great guy.
you just have to get to know him.
Yeah, well, you don't know him like I do.
he always gives new people grief.
he learned that from Gibbs.
okay, quiz time.
what's your take on Sophie Ranier's blood test?
well, she's got elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin.
which means?
she's pregnant?
good, Chip. She's pregnant.
who's pregnant?
Ziva... well, not Ziva, Ziva, but Sophie Ranier, our dead hit girl.
she's got a bun in the oven.
like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?
you're room's clean except for the listening devices we installed.
we're free to talk.
Yeah.
so... you're the one who's been watching us?
Oh, yeah.
when this is over, we really should go out for drinks.
I-I'd like that.
ZIVA: I'm pregnant, Tony.
maybe some other time.
she was... she was kidding.
something wrong?
Thanks.
Oh, she's really not your type anyway.
hot... and in a maid's outfit.
they don't get any more my type.
he's learning.
number's blocked.
talk to me.
I've been told to negotiate a price commensurate with the risk.
I'm listening.
not on the phone.
be in the lobby in exactly one hour.
a black Lincoln will be waiting out front.
make sure you're not followed.
in position, boss.
your people set, Tobias?
got four unmarked vehicles standing by.
we'll be able to follow them wherever they go.
Tony, Ziva... get ready to roll.
hour's almost up.
Roger that, boss.
you haven't fired your weapon, so it's already clean.
it calms my mind.
it forces me to stay focused at the job in my hand
the term's "job at hand.
same difference.
something wrong?
just trying to picture you pregnant.
don't.
I have to.
I'm going to be a father.
it's a great responsibility.
maybe it's not yours.
maybe she didn't know.
Oh, she kn.
so, why take this contract?
put her unborn child in danger?
perhaps we needed the money.
kids are expensive.
and bullets are cheap.
there's a big chance this meeting is a set-up, Tony.
you scared?
no.
excited.
no sign of the Lincoln yet.
GIBBS: That's a solid copy, McGee.
we're sending them down.
FORNELL: All mobile units, prepare to roll on my mark.
th reminds me of our op in the former Czech Republic.
you took a round in the thigh.
I had the same bad feeling before that op, too.
we're on our way to the elevator, boss.
we're not taking any chances on this one.
first sign it goes bad, you call it.
Tony: Hold the door.
Thanks.
sure.
sweetheart...
okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
Yeah, got a visual on that, McGee.
got a match. Abby!
man and a woman just got out.
heading into the hotel.
car's leaving.
I can see that, McGee.
all units, hold your positions.
that's not our Lincoln.
chip: The waiter's got a warrant out on him.
for what?
you're getting off here.
not a wise choice, Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.
weapons.
we would've come to the third floor ourselves.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
very good.
our location and our number in two sentences.
it's too bad your friends can't hear you.
you're being jammed.
MARCOS: Bring them to my room.
if they resist...shoot the woman.
come on, let's go.
to, Ziva, do you copy?
DiNozzo, I said, do you copy?
what the hell is going on there?
McGee: Boss, they're not in the room.
they never arrived in the lobby.
my teams have the entire outside of the building covered.
they didn't leave the hotel, Gibbs.
last contact was at the elevator
that leaves 11 floors they could've gotten off at.
11 floors, McGee.
how many rooms we looking at?
um, well, if we don't count individual bathrooms and, uh, closets... McGee!
264 hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms.
they haven't checked in because they can't.
they're at the meet right now?
they removed their earwigs and they dumped their comm when it was changed to the hotel.
we go room by room. My people seal off...
no. We wait.
what for?
for Ziva to contact us.
we move now, we blow their cover,
and if their cover is already blown, Director?
there are two things you should be painfully aware of right now.
One...no one leaves this business.
and two, never threaten the people who employ you.
should I be writing this down?
I take that as a "no.
Where's the disk?
what disk?
where, Mrs. Ranier?
what makes you think we have it?
we spotted your backup at the restaurant.
on some level, you must have known this was gonna happen.
hm, observant.
how much is our disk worth to you?
I have a better question.
what's it worth to you?
ABBY: It's bad, Gibbs.
it's very, very bad.
remember when we missed nabbing the guy in the restaurant? Mm-hmm.
well, Tony said he didn't see anything, but the eye sees more than we think it does.
it's the brain that misses stuff-- it has to do with the firing of the optic nerve and the visual cortex...
you found something from Tony's camera.
well, I went to the feed, frame by frame.
now, Tony is looking at the pay phone, because that's where he thinks the target is.
but a camera doesn't think, it just records.
so when he runs past the kitchen door of the restaurant, we got... this.
our bad guy.
run it. I want a name.
I do. I did.
he's a contract assassin, Gibbs.
he's wanted in more than five countries.
it doesn't make any sense.
why would a killer hire other killers to do a hit for him?
out of professional courtesy,
I've had Mr. Cord go lightly on your husband.
and I appreciate that.
unfortunately, we're running out of time.
if you let him go, I'll tell you where the disk is.
you'll tell me either way, Mrs. Ranier.
why don't you two take a moment...consider your options.
I might have a plan. What?
the Raniers obviously stole something they want, and you're gonna give it to 'em.
we don't have it.
you're gonna tell them it's in our hotel room, the only way they'll find it is if you show 'em.
McGeshould be waiting for us in there.
good pla- except for one minor drawback.
what?
when I leave...
they'll most likely put a bullet through your head.
Oh. Well, I didn't say it was a perfect plan.
two centimeters below the supra-orbital notch.
what do you make of it, Mr. Palmer?
I originally assumed it was a speck of dirt on the exposure.
it appears to be...a heart? Yes.
rather a strange place to find one.
don't you agree?
it appears to be gold, surgically embedded in the conjunctival layer.
perhaps some type of body jewelry?
jewelry embedded in an eye?
Oh, yes, you'd be amazed what people do to themselves.
to Abby, please.
I doubt anyone would notice your little gold heart unless they knew it was there.
staring into your eyes, face to face...
like a lover.
ABBY: I found a chip in it.
flash memory embedded underneath, sir.
500-megabyte capacity, 50 MPS throughout.
translation?
it contains the Raniers' personal data in two files.
one has a list of numbered bank accounts, a deed for a restaurant, a house in Gilead, Maine.
we also ran the address-- the phone service and cable are scheduled to be turned on next week, sir.
sounds like a retirement plan. She was pregnant, they were getting out of the business-- what about the other file?
it has a list of their clients.
their names, addresses, phone numbers, all their information, everything.
insurance policy? Their ticket out.
they weren't hired to make a hit, Gibbs. They are the hit.
did you know the Peruvians make blades so sharp, some people cat even feel the initial incision. Stop.
the disk's in our hotel room.
don't. He'll only use it... Where?
she has to show you.
not what I asked.
Tony: You'll never find it without her.
even if you kill us.
untie her.
I'm in position.
clear the room-- I'm on my way up with the girl.
my pleasure.
MAOS: Your only mistake was going for one last big payday.
you got greedy.
I'm pregnant.
Really?
Congratulations.
boy or girl?
I don't know.
we want to be surprised.
that's the best way, believe me.
how many months?
three.
morning sickness?
only every single day.
I hated to see my wife go through it.
but believe me, it's all worth it in the end.
so you're not going to kill us?
we're assassins.
you know we can't just walk away from the game when we feel like it.
hell, and to think I'd rather be at my daughter's fifth birthday than here.
so you are gonna kill us, right?
I haven't decided yet.
give me the disk, and we'll see.
play it by ear.
if I'm not back in five minutes...kill him.
that was purely for your wife's cooperation.
we like to call them little white lies.
open it.
I hope you weren't counting on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.
he's not my backup.
Tony! Third floor, room 356.
all teams, third floor, room 356.
federal agent in distress.
copy. We're moving.
you know what's funny?
I was really looking forward to having a kid there for a minute.
this is a big step for me.
having a little DiNozzo running around.
Yeah, that's my full name-- Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo,
Tony: How's that feel, huh?!
huh, big guy?!
ZIVA: Enough!
you want to punch me again? Come on!
Tony, enough, enough.
I think you made your point.
I want a divorce.
DUCKY: The emergency room seems to have done a pretty good job.
how do you feel?
better, now that I can breathe.
DUCKY: There doesn't appear to be any permanent damage.
how many times did he hit you?
I wasn't counting.
seven times.
she was, of course.
it was hard not to.
we're gonna take really good care of you, Tony.
I had Ch pulyour car right around front.
he drove my car?
just... from your parking space.
I took extra special care.
Oh. Thanks.
and, uh,
I'm driving you home. Probie?
uh, Ziva, actually, I should probably drive him home tonight.
why is that?
maybe he wants to li.
DUCKY: Yes, well, however you get home,
I suggest a couple of aspirin.
DUCKY: Yes, and perhaps some scotch.
thought doctors weren't supposed to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.
well, it always seems to work for you.
you get tickets to that Gazelle thing again?
it's Giselle, Jethro, and no, that's not tonight.
marine Corps birthday ball.
she didn't tell you?
DUCKY: Our lovely director has asked me to escort her.
Tony: All right, good night, boss.
darn!
I'm good.
Hey, Gbs.
happy birthday.
I miss you guys.
semper fi.
not bad, I suppose.
not bad, she says, as she walks in from the outdoor patio, past the fax machine and the minibar.
complimentary basket of fruit.
this is the perfect way to spend a weekend.
come on!
big-screen TV.
Ooh, 200 channels.
look at this, HBO, ESPN, History Channel,
Turner Classic Movies.
I take it you're not interested in premium channels.
there's only one thing I'm interested in right now.
《 Under Covers 》
I did.
that's fairly obvious.
for your information, that's my knee.
whatever.
you can get off me now.
it's only been ten minutes.
I have a reputation to protect.
we're not even sure if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.
you can't be too careful when you're undercover.
let's give it another 40 minutes just to be realistic.
realistic, huh?
in that case...
I prefer it on top.
I can live with that.
what was that for?
because that was definitely not your knee.
mm, she's very beautiful, Jethro.
her name's Sophie Ranier.
she's murdered over 25 people, Duck.
and her friend?
her husband-- Jean-Paul Ranier.
both Canadian citizens.
both contract assassins.
she suffered extensive injuries.
it may take quite a while to determine the actll cause of death.
they were killed in a car accident two days ago outside of Kuwait International Airport.
there's the accident report.
I'm assuming this is urgent.
I've waited three months to see Giselle.
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend, doc, - but I do need you... - Giselle's a ballet.
you really should get out of your basement more, Jethro.
we need to know everything we can about these two, Ducky.
why is NCIS investating this?
marine CID found two fake U. S. passports and two first-class tickets for Washington, DC, their luggage.
they have reservations at the Barclay through November 10.
marine Corps birthday. - They're holding the ball there.
hosted by the commandant of the Marine Corps.
our top military leaders congress men, and agency directors will be there.
including me.
Tony and Ziva have taken their room reservatis at the Barclay.
they're there now pretending to be these two.
they're working blind, Duck.
we're counting on you to fill them in on some of the more personal details of our couple.
though it may be common knowledgege that I talk to my patien, unfortunately, to date, none of themavave e ever answered me back.
listen harder.
sweetheart, you know what I could really use right now?
some deodorant?
I was thinking more along the lines of a back massage.
good idea.
why don't you roll over like a good boy.
and to think my mother thought I was too good for you.
What'd I miss?
they had sex.
they have any contact with anyone yet?
just each other. Multiple times.
was it good for you?
wait.
someone's knocking at their door.
who is it? - Room service.
room service.
compliments the hotel management.
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room for bugs...
place some of our own. And he is also wants to talk to you.
you can put it over there, please.
very good, ma'am.
ZIVA: Garcon, we'd like some extra bath towels.
of course.
just checking to make sure everything's in order.
would you like me to have the maid make up the bed for you, sir?
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Oh, and can you check the minibar?
I'd like it restocked with Red Bull.
red Bull.
that'll keep you up all night, ma'amam.
exactly.
please accept this assortment of cheeses, compliments of the hotel.
room service put a tray on our microphone.
you know what that means.
we're screwed?
Nope. You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.
if you whisper, it should be okay.
comfortable, DiNozzo?
well, yeah, working on it. Why do you ask?
we're looking at you, Agent DiNozzo.
all of you.
uh, sorry about that.
DiNozzo, what the hell are you doing?
you're married assassins. You're not visiting the Playboy mansion.
it was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.
incoming call.
have her answer it.
sweet cheeks, do you think you could go over and answer the phone for me while I pour us some champagne?
Thanks, honey.
Yes.
there's a cell phone in the Bible next to your bed.
got it.
keep it with you at all times.
you have dinner reservations at the hotel dining room at 9: 00.
don't be late.
the concrgrge.
we were able to get into the dining room after all...
my love.
it looks like I'm getting dressed up for you tonight.
that wasn't the concierge. That was their contact.
we're on the move.
let's go. We've got to get dressed for dinner.
I'm going.
don't look at me that way, Gibbs.
it was league night when I got your 911.
I was two frames away from a perfect score.
and just for the record, these stupid outfits were not my idea.
I like it. - Is is kind of cute, huh?
no sign of Mr. Palmer, I suppose?
not since this afternoon, Ducky. - Abs, these are their personal effects.
get yourself wired so you can feed whatever you find directly to DiNozzo and David.
looking for anything in particular?
Yeah, anything that will help those two act like them.
solid on the visuals,Tony.
there's quite a crowd here tonight.
see anyone you know, sweet cheeks?
not yet.
but the night's just getting started, my little hairy butt.
ABS. I'm loading the photos into the computer.
duck, you got any scoop for our married couple?
I have the breakdown of the contents of their stomachs and intestines.
if Mr. Ranier had lived,
I would have suggest a more fiber-rich diet.
his colon was almost impacted with fecal material.
you think it's too late to order a salad?
good evening. Table for two?
I believe our food is here now.
thank you.
bon appetit, mon petit pois.
McGee... - report.
got the restaurant covered from the entrance, boss.
I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
Tony, the calluses on Mr. Ranier's hand suggest he was left-handed.
GIBBS: Switch hands, DiNozzo.
this is nice, isn't
Yeah, a quiet little dinner-- just the six of us.
our friend is calling.
ABS, I want that number. - Got it.
starting a reverse search directory now.
I'm glad you called.
we were getting bored.
thought it would help to see your target in person tonight.
he's here?
you don't see him?
relax. I've been flying for over 20 hours.
and the restaurant's packed. We will.
talk to me, Abs.
he's calling from a pay phone. The address is coming up.
you didn't mention anything about being surrounded by U. S. Maris.
it's too dangerous for the sum you're paying us.
accomplish your mission, and we'll discuss more.
but you won't pay us more.
he's calling from a pay phone inside the restaurant.
already moving. I have to go to the little boy's room.
I have to talk to my boss.
do that. We'll wait for you to...
he hung up.
don't move. Federal agent.
it's me, Probie. He's gone.
must have slipped out through the kitchen.
I didn't even get a look.
want us back in the squad room, boss
no, I want you and Ziva back in your room maintaining your cover.
all night?
do I stutter or something, DiNozzo?
afraid I'll bite, Tony?
the name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.
Hey, Abs, what do you got?
I have a "whoopee" and I have a "but.
Abby? - Whoopee
I got a photo of the man that Tony and Ziva are going to assassinate.
But? - But...
I have no idea which of these 32 photos is him.
what makes you think the target's a male?
did you forget I'll be there?
no, whoever set up the hit referred to the caller as a man.
you made contact?
Ziva got a pay phone call.
you trace it?
gee, why didn't I think of that?
sorry, Jethro. I'm a little tired.
Yeah, well, you never could pace yourself very well.
I have one word for you, Jethro.
Posisitano.
come on.
that was a week after I took a bullet.
where did the call originate?
pay phone, the hotel. We got there, the guy was gone.
at least we know he's here keeping tabs on the operation.
Abby's matching these photos with reservations in the restaurant.
she'll check the names against invites to the ball.
it'll narrow the target.
what if the hit has nothing to do with the ball?
someone who's a guest at the hotel?
Ziva told him she didn't know the target would be surrounded by Marines.
and he wasn't surprised. - No.
Hey, nothing's going to happen tonight.
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack, all the backup teams are in place around the hotel.
why don't you go grab 40 on the couch in your office?
no, I just need a little coffee.
yeah? When the caffeine jolt ends?
I'll do what you do.
get a refill. - You're not me.
Chauauvinist. - Yeah.
yeah... I guess.
good night, Jen.
need to bounce something off you.
okay, shoot.
my director side is telling me flood that hotel with security and notify the FBI of a potential terrorist attack.
my agent side?
if I do that, we lose the chance to take down an enemy cell operating inside the capitol.
of course, you'd stay the course, trust your people to get the job done.
you telling me what I'd do?
asking.
if I was director, I'd give my people another 24.
they can't get the job done, I'd notify the FBI.
you'd really do that?
Nah.
but that's why I'll never be director.
the man snores like a drunken sailor.
well, we won't have to listen much longer.
he saw their target at the restaurant. We're on plan.
watched the videotape of their session this afternoon, Maya.
it was pretty hot stuff.
these two really know how to live their life.
you, uh, - you ever think abouthat maybe...? - Forget it.
we're here on a mission, period.
you want something more than coffee, call room service.
Oh, my God.
Ziva? Shh...
come on, you're killing me here.
what?
nothing. I thought I heard something.
crazy chick.
I heard that, my little hairy butt.
morning, boss.
thank you.
Hey, boss, this was sitting on my front porch this morning.
what is it?
it's a package addressed to Ziva.
well, yeah, I can see that, McGee. What is in it?
wasn't sure if I should open it.
that's probably why she's using you as her mule.
sunglasses.
with different lenses?
Why?
to protect her eyes?
you know, I'm going to ask her. I'm going to find out.
Yeah, good idea, McGee. Give 'em their wake-up call.
Hey, DiNozzo!
this is great.
they're sleeping in a five-star hotel, I'm a waiter.
want to trade places, McGee?
you're awake.
since 0500.
he snores.
I've got a package here for you.
my shades.
can you bring them up with breakfast?
sure. Gibbs wants Tony up, too.
my easure.
my little furry bear.
wake up, cheri. - I'm in position, boss!
DUCKY: Make the stitches precise, Mr. Palmer.
uh, yes, Doctor.
and when you're done, I want the supply locker inventoried and cleaned.
I, uh, actually, already did that, Doctor.
then do it again.
what have we fod out, Duck?
that my assistant, Mr. Palmer here, should keep his cell phone with him and turned on at all times.
what can you tell me about our assassins?
Mr. Ranier here had his appendix removed,
Mrs. had her left wrist broken as a child.
we did, however, find some rather curious markings.
markings?
well, tattoos might be the more appropriate word.
almost invisible to the naked eye.
on the inside of the fourth digit of both of their left hands.
an eight?
or the sign for infinity.
some kind of terrorist cell I. D?
on their ring fingers.
perhaps it meqns "love forever."
you know, I want to take another look at the X rays, make sure I didn't miss anything else.
missed a stitch there, Palmer.
we really should take you to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.
Why's that?
because you snore like a drunken sailor with emphysema.
look who's calling the pot black.
kettle.
pot is calling the kettle black.
Oh, I'd really like some music.
something with a little beat, dear?
sorry.
Ooh, you want me...
what do we got?
mm, sneaky people.
top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs. They have a laser trained on our room.
I can't believe that your sunglasses can detect different light spectrums.
Ziva, that is amazing. - DiNozzo, we're going to need a diversion.
I think we can manage something, boss. - Let's roll, McGee.
Ziva, that is amazing.
big whoop, she has spy glasses.
anyone can do that. That's not amazing.
ZIVA: You realize we can still hear you, right, Abby?
I think I'm going to need a cold shower after this.
disgusting.
give me those binoculars.
I don't know how much longer...
I can keep this up, boss.
we're in position, DiNozzo.
give it the big finish.
we could make a fortune with this off the Internet.
they're serial killers, Yussif. I wouldn't recommend trying.
FBI, freeze! - Put it down!
I got a whole new respect for NCIS, Agent McGee.
you guys are hard-core.
Ah, we got lucky.
it's actually the trained laser on the room that gave you away.
we were talking about your agents pretending to be married assassins.
very convincing.
I don't think anyone in the FBI would actually go all the way just to sell a cover story.
I would.
guys, they were acting.
trust me...
I know when someone's acting when they're having sex.
it's true
I've met his wife.
well, Tony and Ziva wouldn't.
...unusual for men to like love stories.
how do I explain to the director of the FBI that we're running an undercover op in his jurisdiction without informing him.
with a smile.
it's not funny, Gibbs.
they had intel that two assassins were going to hit a target at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
did you get that memo?
no.
why didn't I think of that?
beuse you're exhausted.
I told you
get some sleep.
and do that before you take on the director of the FBI.
I can't, Jethro.
I can fix this.
how?
you're not the only one around here knows how to play politics.
you're not serious.
your idea of politics usually involves some form of physical violence.
well, you know what they say, Jen...
can't make an omelet less you break a few eggs.
are we free to go now?
not yet.
what the hell's NCIS doing... - Our job, Fornell.
Yeah, that involve jeopardizing our operation?
you're damn lucky we didn't blow these two away.
which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction!
conference room...
so anxious to play with the big boys...
Really?
big boys, my ass!
Yeah, this is going to be ugly.
Oh, yeah.
Fornell hasn't been this upset since...
the last time we saw him.
gum?
the big boys?
we really screwed this one up.
Oh, you think, Tobias?
the question is, how do we fix it without our directors getting in a world-class pissing match?
joint .
who's lead?
my team's already in place.
did you find out who hired them?
not yet. Working on it.
for my tap dance at the Hoover Building.
give us 24 hours, then we flip.
FBI gets operational control?
Yeah, and credit for the collar.
agreed.
directors get to save face and we...
get the job done.
and people say we're bastards?
only because they know us.
I've got the I. D.'s on the people in the restaurant who have invites to the Marine Corps Ball, ma'am.
uh, Abby. Sorry.
make sure Tony and Ziva get 'em.
okay. Should I also check restaurant staff, too?
international assassins hired to take out a waiter?
I was just trying to be thorough.
no...
it's good.
good instincts, Chip. Run 'em. - Okay.
Hey, Abby, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
why don't you like Officer David?
what makes you think I don't like her?
uh, I found this.
Oh... that.
I understand
I have the same problem with DiNozzo.
Tony is a great guy.
you just have to get to know him.
Yeah, well, you don't know him like I do.
he always gives new people grief.
he learnrned that from Gibbs.
okay, quiz time.
what's your take on Sophie Ranier's blood test?
well, she's got elevated levels of human chorionic nadotropin.
which means?
she's pregnant?
go Chip.
she's pregnant.
who's pregnant?
well, not Ziva, Ziva, our dead hit girl.
she's got a bun in the oven.
like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?
you're room's clean except for the listening devices we installed.
we're free to talk.
Yeah.
so...
you're the one who's been watching us?
Oh, yeah.
when this is over, we really should go out for drinks.
I'd like that.
I'm pregnant, Tony.
maybe some other time.
she was...
she was kidding.
something wrong?
Thanks.
Oh, she's really not your type anyway.
hot... and in a maid's outfit.
they don't get any more my type.
he's learning.
number's blocked.
talk to me.
I've been told to negotiate a price commensurate with the risk.
I'm listening.
not on the phone.
be in the lobby in exactly one hour.
a black Lincoln will be waiting out front.
make sure you're not followed.
in position, boss.
your people set, Tobias?
got four unmarked vehicles standing by.
we'll be able to follow them wherever they go.
get ready to roll.
hour's almost up.
Roger that, boss.
you haven't fire your weapon, so it's already clean
it calms my mind.
it forces me to stay focused at the job in my hand
the term's "job at hand.
same difference.
something wrong?
just trying to picture you pregnant.
don't.
I have to.
I'm going to be a father.
it's a great responsibility.
maybe it's not yours.
maybe she didn't know.
Oh, she knew.
so, why take this contract?
put her unborn child in danger?
perhaps we need d the money.
kids are expensive.
and bullets are cheap.
there's a big chance this meeting is a set-up, Tony.
scared?
no.
excited.
no sign of the Lincoln yet.
GIBBS: That's a solid copy, McGee.
we're sending them down.
FORNELL: All mobile units, prepare to roll on my mark.
th reminds me of our op in the former Czech Republic.
you took a round in the thigh.
I had the same bad feeling before that op, too.
we're on our way to the elevator, boss.
we're not taking any chances on this one.
first sign it goes bad, you call it.
hold the door.
Thanks.
sure.
sweetheart...
okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
Yeah, got a visual on that, McGee.
got a match. Abby!
man and a woman just got out.
heading into the hotel.
car's leaving.
I can see that, McGee.
all units, hold your positions.
that's not our Lincoln.
chip: The waiter's got a warrant out on him.
for what?
murder.
you're getting off here.
not a wise choice,
Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.
weapons.
we would've come to the third floor ourselves.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
very good.
our location and our number in two sentences.
it's too bad your friends can't hear you.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
bring them to my room.
if they resist...
...shoot the woman.
come on, let's go.
Tony, Ziva, do you copy?
DiNozzo, I said, do you copy?
what the hell is going on there?
boss, they're not in the room.
they ner arrived in the lobby.
my teams have the entire outside of the building covered.
they didn't leave the hotel, Gibbs.
last contact was at the elevator
that leaves 11 floors they could've gotten off at.
11 floors, McGee.
how many rooms we looking at?
um, well, if we don't count individual bathrooms and, uh, closets...
264 hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms.
they haven't checked i because they can't.
th're at the meet right now?
they removed their earwigs and they dumd d ththeir comm when it was changed to the hotel.
we go room by room.
my people seal off... - No. We wait.
what for?
for Ziva to contact us.
we move now, we blow their cover, Fornell.
if their cover is already blown, Director?
there two things you should ?
one...
no one leaves this business.
and two, never threaten the people who employ you.
should I be writing this down?
I take that as a "no."
Where's the disk?
what disk?
where, Mrs. Ranier?
what makes you think we have it?
we spotted your backup at the restaurant.
on some level, you must have known this was gonna happen.
hm, observant.
how much is our disk worth to you?
I have a better question.
what's it worth toyou?
it's bad, Gibbs.
it's very, very bad.
remember when we missed nabbing the guy in the restaurant? Mm-hmm.
well, Tony said he didn't see anything, but the eye sees more than we think it does.
it's the brain that misses stuff
it has to do with the firing of the optic nerve and the visual cortex...You found something from Tony's camera.
wei I went to the feed, frame by frame.
now, Tony is looking at the pay phone, because that's where he thinks the target is.
but a camera doesn't think, it just records.
so when he runs past the kitchen door of the restaurant, we got... this.
our bad guy.
run it.
I want a name.
I do. I did.
he's a contract assassin, Gibbs.
he's wanted in more than five countries.
it doesn't make any sense.
why would a killer hire other killers to do a hit for him?
out of professional courtesy,
I've had Mr. Cord go lightly on your husband.
and I appreciate that.
unfortunately, we're running out of time.
if you let him go,
I'll tell you where the disk is.
you'll tell me either way, Mrs. Ranier.
why don't you two take a moment...
...consider your options.
I might have a plan.
what?
the Raniers obviously stole something they want, and you're gonna give it to 'em.
we don't have it.
you're gonna tell them's in our hotel room, the only way they'll finind it is if you show 'em.
McGee should be waiting for us in there.
good plan
except for one minor drawback.
what?
when I leave...
they'll most likely put a bullet through your he.
Oh.
well, I didn't say it was a perfect plan.
two centimeters below the pra-orbital notch.
what do you make of it, Mr. Palme
I originally assumed it was a speck of dirt on the exposure.
it appears to be...
a heart?
Yes.
rather a strange place to find one.
don't you agree?
it appears to be gold, surgically embedded in the conjunctival layer.
perhaps some type of body jewelry?
jewelry embedded in an eye?
Oh, yes, you'd be amazed what people to themselves.
to Abby please.
I doubt anyone would notice your little gold heart unless they knew it was there.
staring into your eyes, face to face...
like a lover.
I found a chip in it.
Flmemory embedded underneath, sir.
500-megabyte capacity, 50 MPS throuout.
translation?
it contains the Raniers'personal data in two files.
one has a list of numbered bank accounts, a deed for a restaurant, - a house in Gilead, Maine. - We also ran the address
the phone service and cable are scheduled to be turned on next wee s s sirir.
sounds like a retirement plan.
she was pregnant, they were getting out of the business
what about the her file?
it has a list heir clients.
their names, addresses, phone number all their information, everything.
insurance policy?
their ticket out.
they weren't hired to make a hit, Gibbs.
they are the hit.
did you know the Peruvians make blades so sharp, some people cat even feel the initial incision. Stop.
stop.
the disk's in our hotel room.
don't. He'll only use it... Where?
she has to show you.
not what asked.
you' never find it without her.
even if you kill us.
untie her.
I'm in position.
clear the room
I'm on my way up with the girl.
my pleasure.
your only mistake was going for one last big payday.
you got greedy.
I'm pregnant.
Really?
Congratulations.
boy or girl?
I don't know.
we want a surprised.
that's the best way, believe me.
how many months?
three.
morning sickness?
only every single day.
I hated to see my wife go through it.
but believe me, it's all worth it in the end.
so you're not going to kill us?
we're assassins.
you know we can't just walk away from the game when we feel like it.
hell, and to think I'd rather at my dadaugughter's fifth birthday than here.
so youare gonna kill us, right?
I haven't decided yet.
give me the disk, and we'll see.
play it by ear.
if I'm not back in five minutes...
...kill him.
that was purely for your wife's cooperation.
we like to call them little white lies.
open it.
I hope you weren't counting on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.
he's not my backup.
third floor, room 356.
all teams, third floor, room 356.
federal agent in distress.
copy. We're moving.
you know what's funny?
I was really looking forward to having a kid there for a minute.
this is a big step for me.
having a little DiNozzo running around.
Yeah, that's my full name
special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS
how's that feel, huh?!
huh, big guy?!
enough! - You want to punch me again?
come on!
Tony, enough, enough.
I think you made your point.
I want a divorce.
the emergey room seems to have done a pretty good job.
how do you feel?
better, now that can breathe.
DUCKY: There doesn't appear to be any permanent damage.
how many times did he hit you?
I wasn't counting.
seven timemes.
she was, of course.
it was hard not to.
we're gonna take really good care of you, Tony.
I had Chip pull your car right around front.
he drove my car?
just... from your parking space.
I took extra special care.
Oh. Thanks.
and, uh,
I'm driving you home.
probie?
uh, Ziva, actually,
I should probably drive him home tonight.
why is that?
maybe he wants to live.
Yes, well, however you get home,
I suggest a couple of aspirin.
Ow. - Yes, and perhaps some scotch.
thought doctors weren't supposed to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.
well, it always seems to work foryou.
Yogeget t tickets to that Gazelle thing again?
It'sGiselle, Jethro, and no, that's not tonight.
marine Corps birt ball.
she did tell you?
our lovely director has asked me to escort her.
all right, good night, boss.
Damn!
I'm good.
Hey, Gibbs.
happy birthday.
I miss you guys.
semper fi.
I did.
that's fairly obvious.
for your information, that's my knee.
whatever.
you can get off me now.
it's only been ten minutes.
I have a reputation to protect.
we're not even sure if we're under surveillance yet, Tony.
you can't be too careful when you're undercover.
let's give it another 40 minutes just to be realistic.
realistic, huh?
in that case...
I prefer it on top.
I can live with that.
what was that for?
because that was definitely not your knee.
mm, she's very beautiful, Jethro.
her name's Sophie Ranier.
she's murdered over 25 people, Duck.
and her friend?
her husband-- Jean-Paul Ranier.
both Canadian citizens.
both contract assassins.
she suffered extensive injuries.
it may take quite a while to determine the actll cause of death.
they were killed in a car accident two days ago outside of Kuwait International Airport.
there's the accident report.
I'm assuming this is urgent.
I've waited three months to see Giselle.
Yeah, apologies about the girlfriend, doc, - but I do need you... - Giselle's a ballet.
you really should get out of your basement more, Jethro.
we need to know everything we can about these two, Ducky.
why is NCIS investating this?
marine CID found two fake U. S. passports and two first-class tickets for Washington, DC, their luggage.
they have reservations at the Barclay through November 10.
marine Corps birthday. - They're holding the ball there.
hosted by the commandant of the Marine Corps.
our top military leaders congress men, and agency directors will be there.
including me.
Tony and Ziva have taken their room reservatis at the Barclay.
they're there now pretending to be these two.
they're working blind, Duck.
we're counting on you to fill them in on some of the more personal details of our couple.
though it may be common knowledgege that I talk to my patien, unfortunately, to date, none of themavave e ever answered me back.
listen harder.
sweetheart, you know what I could really use right now?
some deodorant?
I was thinking more along the lines of a back massage.
good idea.
why don't you roll over like a good boy.
and to think my mother thought I was too good for you.
What'd I miss?
they had sex.
they have any contact with anyone yet?
just each other. Multiple times.
was it good for you?
wait.
someone's knocking at their door.
who is it? - Room service.
room service.
compliments the hotel management.
Gibbs wants me to sweep the room for bugs...
place some of our own. And he is also wants to talk to you.
you can put it over there, please.
very good, ma'am.
ZIVA: Garcon, we'd like some extra bath towels.
of course.
just checking to make sure everything's in order.
would you like me to have the maid make up the bed for you, sir?
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Oh, and can you check the minibar?
I'd like it restocked with Red Bull.
red Bull.
that'll keep you up all night, ma'amam.
exactly.
please accept this assortment of cheeses, compliments of the hotel.
room service put a tray on our microphone.
you know what that means.
we're screwed?
Nope. You get to dress up as a maid, Maya.
if you whisper, it should be okay.
comfortable, DiNozzo?
well, yeah, working on it. Why do you ask?
we're looking at you, Agent DiNozzo.
all of you.
uh, sorry about that.
DiNozzo, what the hell are you doing?
you're married assassins. You're not visiting the Playboy mansion.
it was kind of Ziva's idea, boss.
incoming call.
have her answer it.
sweet cheeks, do you think you could go over and answer the phone for me while I pour us some champagne?
Thanks, honey.
Yes.
there's a cell phone in the Bible next to your bed.
got it.
keep it with you at all times.
you have dinner reservations at the hotel dining room at 9: 00.
don't be late.
the concrgrge.
we were able to get into the dining room after all...
my love.
it looks like I'm getting dressed up for you tonight.
that wasn't the concierge. That was their contact.
we're on the move.
let's go. We've got to get dressed for dinner.
I'm going.
don't look at me that way, Gibbs.
it was league night when I got your 911.
I was two frames away from a perfect score.
and just for the record, these stupid outfits were not my idea.
I like it. - Is is kind of cute, huh?
no sign of Mr. Palmer, I suppose?
not since this afternoon, Ducky. - Abs, these are their personal effects.
get yourself wired so you can feed whatever you find directly to DiNozzo and David.
looking for anything in particular?
Yeah, anything that will help those two act like them.
solid on the visuals,Tony.
there's quite a crowd here tonight.
see anyone you know, sweet cheeks?
not yet.
but the night's just getting started, my little hairy butt.
ABS. I'm loading the photos into the computer.
duck, you got any scoop for our married couple?
I have the breakdown of the contents of their stomachs and intestines.
if Mr. Ranier had lived,
I would have suggest a more fiber-rich diet.
his colon was almost impacted with fecal material.
you think it's too late to order a salad?
good evening. Table for two?
I believe our food is here now.
thank you.
bon appetit, mon petit pois.
McGee... - report.
got the restaurant covered from the entrance, boss.
I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy.
Tony, the calluses on Mr. Ranier's hand suggest he was left-handed.
GIBBS: Switch hands, DiNozzo.
this is nice, isn't
Yeah, a quiet little dinner-- just the six of us.
our friend is calling.
ABS, I want that number. - Got it.
starting a reverse search directory now.
I'm glad you called.
we were getting bored.
thought it would help to see your target in person tonight.
he's here?
you don't see him?
relax. I've been flying for over 20 hours.
and the restaurant's packed. We will.
talk to me, Abs.
he's calling from a pay phone. The address is coming up.
you didn't mention anything about being surrounded by U. S. Maris.
it's too dangerous for the sum you're paying us.
accomplish your mission, and we'll discuss more.
but you won't pay us more.
he's calling from a pay phone inside the restaurant.
already moving. I have to go to the little boy's room.
I have to talk to my boss.
do that. We'll wait for you to...
he hung up.
don't move. Federal agent.
it's me, Probie. He's gone.
must have slipped out through the kitchen.
I didn't even get a look.
want us back in the squad room, boss
no, I want you and Ziva back in your room maintaining your cover.
all night?
do I stutter or something, DiNozzo?
afraid I'll bite, Tony?
the name is Jean-Paul, Sophie.
Hey, Abs, what do you got?
I have a "whoopee" and I have a "but.
Abby? - Whoopee
I got a photo of the man that Tony and Ziva are going to assassinate.
But? - But...
I have no idea which of these 32 photos is him.
what makes you think the target's a male?
did you forget I'll be there?
no, whoever set up the hit referred to the caller as a man.
you made contact?
Ziva got a pay phone call.
you trace it?
gee, why didn't I think of that?
sorry, Jethro. I'm a little tired.
Yeah, well, you never could pace yourself very well.
I have one word for you, Jethro.
Posisitano.
come on.
that was a week after I took a bullet.
where did the call originate?
pay phone, the hotel. We got there, the guy was gone.
at least we know he's here keeping tabs on the operation.
Abby's matching these photos with reservations in the restaurant.
she'll check the names against invites to the ball.
it'll narrow the target.
what if the hit has nothing to do with the ball?
someone who's a guest at the hotel?
Ziva told him she didn't know the target would be surrounded by Marines.
and he wasn't surprised. - No.
Hey, nothing's going to happen tonight.
Tony and Ziva are hitting the rack, all the backup teams are in place around the hotel.
why don't you go grab 40 on the couch in your office?
no, I just need a little coffee.
yeah? When the caffeine jolt ends?
I'll do what you do.
get a refill. - You're not me.
Chauauvinist. - Yeah.
yeah... I guess.
good night, Jen.
need to bounce something off you.
okay, shoot.
my director side is telling me flood that hotel with security and notify the FBI of a potential terrorist attack.
my agent side?
if I do that, we lose the chance to take down an enemy cell operating inside the capitol.
of course, you'd stay the course, trust your people to get the job done.
you telling me what I'd do?
asking.
if I was director, I'd give my people another 24.
they can't get the job done, I'd notify the FBI.
you'd really do that?
Nah.
but that's why I'll never be director.
the man snores like a drunken sailor.
well, we won't have to listen much longer.
he saw their target at the restaurant. We're on plan.
watched the videotape of their session this afternoon, Maya.
it was pretty hot stuff.
these two really know how to live their life.
you, uh, - you ever think abouthat maybe...? - Forget it.
we're here on a mission, period.
you want something more than coffee, call room service.
Oh, my God.
Ziva? Shh...
come on, you're killing me here.
what?
nothing. I thought I heard something.
crazy chick.
I heard that, my little hairy butt.
morning, boss.
thank you.
Hey, boss, this was sitting on my front porch this morning.
what is it?
it's a package addressed to Ziva.
well, yeah, I can see that, McGee. What is in it?
wasn't sure if I should open it.
that's probably why she's using you as her mule.
sunglasses.
with different lenses?
Why?
to protect her eyes?
you know, I'm going to ask her. I'm going to find out.
Yeah, good idea, McGee. Give 'em their wake-up call.
Hey, DiNozzo!
this is great.
they're sleeping in a five-star hotel, I'm a waiter.
want to trade places, McGee?
you're awake.
since 0500.
he snores.
I've got a package here for you.
my shades.
can you bring them up with breakfast?
sure. Gibbs wants Tony up, too.
my easure.
my little furry bear.
wake up, cheri. - I'm in position, boss!
DUCKY: Make the stitches precise, Mr. Palmer.
uh, yes, Doctor.
and when you're done, I want the supply locker inventoried and cleaned.
I, uh, actually, already did that, Doctor.
then do it again.
what have we fod out, Duck?
that my assistant, Mr. Palmer here, should keep his cell phone with him and turned on at all times.
what can you tell me about our assassins?
Mr. Ranier here had his appendix removed,
Mrs. had her left wrist broken as a child.
we did, however, find some rather curious markings.
markings?
well, tattoos might be the more appropriate word.
almost invisible to the naked eye.
on the inside of the fourth digit of both of their left hands.
an eight?
or the sign for infinity.
some kind of terrorist cell I. D?
on their ring fingers.
perhaps it meqns "love forever."
you know, I want to take another look at the X rays, make sure I didn't miss anything else.
missed a stitch there, Palmer.
we really should take you to see the doctor, sweet cheeks.
Why's that?
because you snore like a drunken sailor with emphysema.
look who's calling the pot black.
kettle.
pot is calling the kettle black.
Oh, I'd really like some music.
something with a little beat, dear?
sorry.
Ooh, you want me...
what do we got?
mm, sneaky people.
top floor, northwest corner, Gibbs. They have a laser trained on our room.
I can't believe that your sunglasses can detect different light spectrums.
Ziva, that is amazing. - DiNozzo, we're going to need a diversion.
I think we can manage something, boss. - Let's roll, McGee.
Ziva, that is amazing.
big whoop, she has spy glasses.
anyone can do that. That's not amazing.
ZIVA: You realize we can still hear you, right, Abby?
I think I'm going to need a cold shower after this.
disgusting.
give me those binoculars.
I don't know how much longer...
I can keep this up, boss.
we're in position, DiNozzo.
give it the big finish.
we could make a fortune with this off the Internet.
they're serial killers, Yussif. I wouldn't recommend trying.
FBI, freeze! - Put it down!
I got a whole new respect for NCIS, Agent McGee.
you guys are hard-core.
Ah, we got lucky.
it's actually the trained laser on the room that gave you away.
we were talking about your agents pretending to be married assassins.
very convincing.
I don't think anyone in the FBI would actually go all the way just to sell a cover story.
I would.
guys, they were acting.
trust me...
I know when someone's acting when they're having sex.
it's true
I've met his wife.
well, Tony and Ziva wouldn't.
...unusual for men to like love stories.
how do I explain to the director of the FBI that we're running an undercover op in his jurisdiction without informing him.
with a smile.
it's not funny, Gibbs.
they had intel that two assassins were going to hit a target at the Marine Corps Birthday Ball.
did you get that memo?
no.
why didn't I think of that?
beuse you're exhausted.
I told you
get some sleep.
and do that before you take on the director of the FBI.
I can't, Jethro.
I can fix this.
how?
you're not the only one around here knows how to play politics.
you're not serious.
your idea of politics usually involves some form of physical violence.
well, you know what they say, Jen...
can't make an omelet less you break a few eggs.
are we free to go now?
not yet.
what the hell's NCIS doing... - Our job, Fornell.
Yeah, that involve jeopardizing our operation?
you're damn lucky we didn't blow these two away.
which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't strayed into our jurisdiction!
conference room...
so anxious to play with the big boys...
Really?
big boys, my ass!
Yeah, this is going to be ugly.
Oh, yeah.
Fornell hasn't been this upset since...
the last time we saw him.
gum?
the big boys?
we really screwed this one up.
Oh, you think, Tobias?
the question is, how do we fix it without our directors getting in a world-class pissing match?
joint .
who's lead?
my team's already in place.
did you find out who hired them?
not yet. Working on it.
for my tap dance at the Hoover Building.
give us 24 hours, then we flip.
FBI gets operational control?
Yeah, and credit for the collar.
agreed.
directors get to save face and we...
get the job done.
and people say we're bastards?
only because they know us.
I've got the I. D.'s on the people in the restaurant who have invites to the Marine Corps Ball, ma'am.
uh, Abby. Sorry.
make sure Tony and Ziva get 'em.
okay. Should I also check restaurant staff, too?
international assassins hired to take out a waiter?
I was just trying to be thorough.
no...
it's good.
good instincts, Chip. Run 'em. - Okay.
Hey, Abby, can I ask you a question?
Yes.
why don't you like Officer David?
what makes you think I don't like her?
uh, I found this.
Oh... that.
I understand
I have the same problem with DiNozzo.
Tony is a great guy.
you just have to get to know him.
Yeah, well, you don't know him like I do.
he always gives new people grief.
he learnrned that from Gibbs.
okay, quiz time.
what's your take on Sophie Ranier's blood test?
well, she's got elevated levels of human chorionic nadotropin.
which means?
she's pregnant?
go Chip.
she's pregnant.
who's pregnant?
well, not Ziva, Ziva, our dead hit girl.
she's got a bun in the oven.
like what you see, Agent DiNozzo?
you're room's clean except for the listening devices we installed.
we're free to talk.
Yeah.
so...
you're the one who's been watching us?
Oh, yeah.
when this is over, we really should go out for drinks.
I'd like that.
I'm pregnant, Tony.
maybe some other time.
she was...
she was kidding.
something wrong?
Thanks.
Oh, she's really not your type anyway.
hot... and in a maid's outfit.
they don't get any more my type.
he's learning.
number's blocked.
talk to me.
I've been told to negotiate a price commensurate with the risk.
I'm listening.
not on the phone.
be in the lobby in exactly one hour.
a black Lincoln will be waiting out front.
make sure you're not followed.
in position, boss.
your people set, Tobias?
got four unmarked vehicles standing by.
we'll be able to follow them wherever they go.
get ready to roll.
hour's almost up.
Roger that, boss.
you haven't fire your weapon, so it's already clean
it calms my mind.
it forces me to stay focused at the job in my hand
the term's "job at hand.
same difference.
something wrong?
just trying to picture you pregnant.
don't.
I have to.
I'm going to be a father.
it's a great responsibility.
maybe it's not yours.
maybe she didn't know.
Oh, she knew.
so, why take this contract?
put her unborn child in danger?
perhaps we need d the money.
kids are expensive.
and bullets are cheap.
there's a big chance this meeting is a set-up, Tony.
scared?
no.
excited.
no sign of the Lincoln yet.
GIBBS: That's a solid copy, McGee.
we're sending them down.
FORNELL: All mobile units, prepare to roll on my mark.
th reminds me of our op in the former Czech Republic.
you took a round in the thigh.
I had the same bad feeling before that op, too.
we're on our way to the elevator, boss.
we're not taking any chances on this one.
first sign it goes bad, you call it.
hold the door.
Thanks.
sure.
sweetheart...
okay, black Lincoln just pulled up.
Yeah, got a visual on that, McGee.
got a match. Abby!
man and a woman just got out.
heading into the hotel.
car's leaving.
I can see that, McGee.
all units, hold your positions.
that's not our Lincoln.
chip: The waiter's got a warrant out on him.
for what?
murder.
you're getting off here.
not a wise choice,
Mr. and Mrs. Ranier.
weapons.
we would've come to the third floor ourselves.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
very good.
our location and our number in two sentences.
it's too bad your friends can't hear you.
three armed escorts seems a bit excessive.
bring them to my room.
if they resist...
...shoot the woman.
come on, let's go.
Tony, Ziva, do you copy?
DiNozzo, I said, do you copy?
what the hell is going on there?
boss, they're not in the room.
they ner arrived in the lobby.
my teams have the entire outside of the building covered.
they didn't leave the hotel, Gibbs.
last contact was at the elevator
that leaves 11 floors they could've gotten off at.
11 floors, McGee.
how many rooms we looking at?
um, well, if we don't count individual bathrooms and, uh, closets...
264 hotel rooms, 22 utility rooms.
they haven't checked i because they can't.
th're at the meet right now?
they removed their earwigs and they dumd d ththeir comm when it was changed to the hotel.
we go room by room.
my people seal off... - No. We wait.
what for?
for Ziva to contact us.
we move now, we blow their cover, Fornell.
if their cover is already blown, Director?
there two things you should ?
one...
no one leaves this business.
and two, never threaten the people who employ you.
should I be writing this down?
I take that as a "no."
Where's the disk?
what disk?
where, Mrs. Ranier?
what makes you think we have it?
we spotted your backup at the restaurant.
on some level, you must have known this was gonna happen.
hm, observant.
how much is our disk worth to you?
I have a better question.
what's it worth toyou?
it's bad, Gibbs.
it's very, very bad.
remember when we missed nabbing the guy in the restaurant? Mm-hmm.
well, Tony said he didn't see anything, but the eye sees more than we think it does.
it's the brain that misses stuff
it has to do with the firing of the optic nerve and the visual cortex...You found something from Tony's camera.
wei I went to the feed, frame by frame.
now, Tony is looking at the pay phone, because that's where he thinks the target is.
but a camera doesn't think, it just records.
so when he runs past the kitchen door of the restaurant, we got... this.
our bad guy.
run it.
I want a name.
I do. I did.
he's a contract assassin, Gibbs.
he's wanted in more than five countries.
it doesn't make any sense.
why would a killer hire other killers to do a hit for him?
out of professional courtesy,
I've had Mr. Cord go lightly on your husband.
and I appreciate that.
unfortunately, we're running out of time.
if you let him go,
I'll tell you where the disk is.
you'll tell me either way, Mrs. Ranier.
why don't you two take a moment...
...consider your options.
I might have a plan.
what?
the Raniers obviously stole something they want, and you're gonna give it to 'em.
we don't have it.
you're gonna tell them's in our hotel room, the only way they'll finind it is if you show 'em.
McGee should be waiting for us in there.
good plan
except for one minor drawback.
what?
when I leave...
they'll most likely put a bullet through your he.
Oh.
well, I didn't say it was a perfect plan.
two centimeters below the pra-orbital notch.
what do you make of it, Mr. Palme
I originally assumed it was a speck of dirt on the exposure.
it appears to be...
a heart?
Yes.
rather a strange place to find one.
don't you agree?
it appears to be gold, surgically embedded in the conjunctival layer.
perhaps some type of body jewelry?
jewelry embedded in an eye?
Oh, yes, you'd be amazed what people to themselves.
to Abby please.
I doubt anyone would notice your little gold heart unless they knew it was there.
staring into your eyes, face to face...
like a lover.
I found a chip in it.
Flmemory embedded underneath, sir.
500-megabyte capacity, 50 MPS throuout.
translation?
it contains the Raniers'personal data in two files.
one has a list of numbered bank accounts, a deed for a restaurant, - a house in Gilead, Maine. - We also ran the address
the phone service and cable are scheduled to be turned on next wee s s sirir.
sounds like a retirement plan.
she was pregnant, they were getting out of the business
what about the her file?
it has a list heir clients.
their names, addresses, phone number all their information, everything.
insurance policy?
their ticket out.
they weren't hired to make a hit, Gibbs.
they are the hit.
did you know the Peruvians make blades so sharp, some people cat even feel the initial incision. Stop.
stop.
the disk's in our hotel room.
don't. He'll only use it... Where?
she has to show you.
not what asked.
you' never find it without her.
even if you kill us.
untie her.
I'm in position.
clear the room
I'm on my way up with the girl.
my pleasure.
your only mistake was going for one last big payday.
you got greedy.
I'm pregnant.
Really?
Congratulations.
boy or girl?
I don't know.
we want a surprised.
that's the best way, believe me.
how many months?
three.
morning sickness?
only every single day.
I hated to see my wife go through it.
but believe me, it's all worth it in the end.
so you're not going to kill us?
we're assassins.
you know we can't just walk away from the game when we feel like it.
hell, and to think I'd rather at my dadaugughter's fifth birthday than here.
so youare gonna kill us, right?
I haven't decided yet.
give me the disk, and we'll see.
play it by ear.
if I'm not back in five minutes...
...kill him.
that was purely for your wife's cooperation.
we like to call them little white lies.
open it.
I hope you weren't counting on your backup, Mrs. Ranier.
he's not my backup.
third floor, room 356.
all teams, third floor, room 356.
federal agent in distress.
copy. We're moving.
you know what's funny?
I was really looking forward to having a kid there for a minute.
this is a big step for me.
having a little DiNozzo running around.
Yeah, that's my full name
special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS
how's that feel, huh?!
huh, big guy?!
enough! - You want to punch me again?
come on!
Tony, enough, enough.
I think you made your point.
I want a divorce.
the emergey room seems to have done a pretty good job.
how do you feel?
better, now that can breathe.
DUCKY: There doesn't appear to be any permanent damage.
how many times did he hit you?
I wasn't counting.
seven timemes.
she was, of course.
it was hard not to.
we're gonna take really good care of you, Tony.
I had Chip pull your car right around front.
he drove my car?
just... from your parking space.
I took extra special care.
Oh. Thanks.
and, uh,
I'm driving you home.
probie?
uh, Ziva, actually,
I should probably drive him home tonight.
why is that?
maybe he wants to live.
Yes, well, however you get home,
I suggest a couple of aspirin.
Ow. - Yes, and perhaps some scotch.
thought doctors weren't supposed to prescribe alcohol anymore, Duck.
well, it always seems to work foryou.
Yogeget t tickets to that Gazelle thing again?
It'sGiselle, Jethro, and no, that's not tonight.
marine Corps birt ball.
she did tell you?
our lovely director has asked me to escort her.
all right, good night, boss.
Damn!
I'm good.
Hey, Gibbs.
happy birthday.
I miss you guys.
semper fi.
third time's the charm, Otto.
you can do it.
give me a 180, Otto.
Yes! Didn't touch a single cone on that run.
I would call that a pass, baby.
phase two.
this one's for you, Torsten.
go for it, otto.
make me proud.
avoiding civilian casualties during high-speed egress.
sorry about that, Torsten.
need to recalibrat the braking-to-surface algorithm.
that was my fault, Otto.
not yours.
test concluded.
take me home, Otto, still a few bugs to work out, but Otto and I are both feeling much better about the drive-off next week.
Oh, note for jamie--fuel pressure gauge is fluctuating.
malfunction in the electrical system at 06:38.
initiating software shutdown.
exhaust the cabin.
Otto's core is frozen.
I'm hitting the kill switch.
come on...come on!
I'm trapped in the ca...
lights, please.
from the video presentation, it's clear that...
sexual harassment can take many forms in the workplace.
a coworker with elevator eyes looks you up and down, a coworker shows you a cartoon or photo of a sexual nature.
if you're lucky.
a coworker's hand accidentally brushes up against your body.
if you're really lucky.
physical contact can be divided into three categories.
green light includes normal behior.
yellow light includes borderline behaviors such as hugging someone or...
Yep? -What's wrong with hugging people?
I hug people all the time.
you may see it as friendly, but your coworkers may find it offensive.
you guys get offended when I hug you?
no. No. No. -Of course not, Abby.
no, no, no.
I'm hugging yoall in my mind right now.
D. O.D. Policy is very clear about this point, miss.
you must first ask permission before making physical contact with a coworker.
like, every time? -Yes.
and finally, there's red light behavior, such as deliberate, unwelcomed touching.
another question? -Yeah, what if you slap someone in the back of the head like this?
would that be considered inappropriate behavior?
Absolutely.
are you saying that this has actually happened?
no, I was just wondering, that's all.
yes?
uh, yes, uh...
what if part of your job... -Gibbs.
Includes...touching naked people and.
that's inappropriate at any time.
even if they're dead?
why are you touching dead, naked people?
you see, I work in autopsy...
can we try to keep this discussion focused on the topic...
gear up.
navy lieutenant's been found dead in an R & D facility in Fairfax.
wait, I can't mark you as attending unless you're here for...
uh, ms. Taylor.
I will take excellent notes for them.
okay...
Ducky won't be here.
he's got to take his mom to the hospital.
is Victoria all right?
well, she cut herself shaving, and for some reason, she thinks you can handle this, Palmer.
uh...what do you think, Agent Gibbs?
well, I don't know, palmer.
you got me a T. O.D?
Yes. Uh, according to the liver probe, she died two hours and 18 minutes ago.
does it tell you how?
actually, the probe only tells you the difference between ambien TM and...
but you already know all this.
uh, tentatively, I'd say she died from hypoxia, Agent Gibbs.
carbon monoxide poisoning.
Yeah, most likely.
in 68% of cases, it's accidental and, uh, the other 29% are self-inflicted.
I'm more conrned with the three percent you left out.
Palmer, he's talking about the ones deliberately murdered this way.
how'd she get on the floor?
coworker found her in the passenger seat, in there, doors still closed and the engine running.
he drove it out, attempted CPR.
Tony's taking a statement now.
what kind of vehicle is this?
it is a second generation fully autonomous AI-operated vehicle, boss.
well, yeah.
Yeah, I can see that, Mcgee.
I mean, other than the obvious.
wait, you actually understood that?
you know what it does then?
Yeah, your basic second generation AI...
autonomous...stuff.
where the hell does the driver sit?
that's the point. There isn't one.
it drives itself.
Boss,"AI" stands for artificial intelligence.
it's a robot.
all I'm saying, Agent Dinozzo is...
our entire team is under a tremendous amount of stress.
we're competing against dozens of teams.
three and a half years of work, and it all comes down to a single proof of concept test.
robot car race.
in crude terms, yes.
what do you get if you win?
recognition in my field.
what about one of those cool trophies like they hand out at NASCAR?
I wouldn't know. I'm a scientist, not a redneck.
it is the fastest-growing sport in the country.
I rest my case.
in my opinion, it's clear what happened here.
when I found Seabrook, she was sitting in Otto with the diagnostic bay doors closed and the engine running.
what's that tell you?
you think she killed herself?
I do.
what about an accident or a malfunction?
all she had to do to shut otto down was to flick the kill switch.
it was right in front of her on the dashboard.
look, obviously she couldn't face her own faults and missed deadlines, so she took the coward's way out.
at's enough, Torsten.-She's dead, Russell.
there's no need for you to continue this charade of defending her.
I'm Dr. Pike. Project leader.
where is Lieutenant Seabrook?
could you stop?
can I...can I see her?
what have you done?
Ziva, you have really got to see this.
see what, mcgee?
it's an atlas-seven cpu.
it's the same one developed for the Martian rovers.
and how does this pertain to the case?
well, it doesn't. I just thought it was cool.
see, the thing about...
that better be your handcuffs.
I believe this is a assic yellow light situation.
stop moving, Mcgee.
my hand's stuck.
it's not the only thing that's stuck.
make that a red light situation, what are you doing?
investigating a dead naval officer.
that's a $22 million piece of equipment, you...
you people are jeopardizing my entire project.
we're doing our jobs. What'd you find?
Ah, there's a usb cable, still attached to the console in the passenger side.
also bagged battery for a laptop in the front seat.
I removed the laptop.
we'll need it. -Absolutely not.
it contains a backup copy of Otto's AI.
well, whatever that is, we'll need that, too.
that is Otto.
already got it covered, Tony.
tow truck should be here any minute now.
this is our only prototype!
you people...
you people are...
you're...
we're cops, federal agents, police officers?
maybe if you sound it out, it's easier.
you know, English as a third language is always the trickiest one.
I'll take the laptop now, please.
I've known Roni for almost ten years, Agent Gibbs.
she was one of my brightest students at MIT.
an exceptional mind.
light-years ahead of her peers when it came to the field of artificial intelligence.
machines that can think. -Yes.
so, that Humvee can think?
only about driving.
an easy task for you or me, but for a machine, it takes millions of calculations a second and complex reasoning skills.
according to the navy, your thinking car is a joint project with them and Azeon.
they've been very good to us as far as resources go.
meaning money.
and Lieutenant Seabrook's time.
gonna need your security tapes and access logs that you keep, doctor.
she wasn't even supposed to be here this morning, Agent Gibbs.
she worked late last night. I...
I...I gave her the morning off.
she didn't take it.
she died in your garage at zero-six-forty this morning.
she must have come in to run a test.
she's a...
was a perfectionist.
never satisfied.
traits I'm afraid I encouraged her in.
sitting in a running vehicle inside an enclosed space is not a bright idea.
trust me, Agent Gibbs...
Roni was not the type to kill herself.
what type was she, doctor?
driven.
lieutenant Seabrook's naval career was most unusual.
no deployments and, as far as I can tell, she never set foot on a ship.
well, she was an egghead.
they don't recruit them to fighters.
no. Just to build the machines for fighting them.
maybe she had enough. -Enough of what?
you'd be surprised how many weapon designers take their own lives.
I might have a better motive.
Azeon had everytng leveraged on Otto.
it fails the drive-off, the company goes bankrupt.
sabotage.
someone wanted them to fail.
not bad, Mcgee.
I got one better than better.
curious to know what follows red light behavior, Ziva?
a potential pregnancy?
it's a good guess, but not in this case.
check this out.
ran the security footage taken from the lab zero-one-fifteen.
last two people present were our Lieutenant and this guy.
Azeon's chief mechanic, Jamie Jones.
hold on to your socks.
gets a little steaming.
what about the video from this morning, when she died?
Oh, yeah!
why didn't I think of that?!
cause someone erased it.
the last image taken from any camera stops at zero-five-thirty-seven this morning.
and then nothing but snow.
she was murdered.
did you find my bag, Mr. Palmer?
in the trunk of your car, doctor.
Ah, thank you.
I'm sorry if I seem a bit flustered today.
that's understandable, doctor.
where did your mother cut herself? - Well, let's just say that a woman in her 90s should not be using a straight-edged razor when grooming, and leave it at that.
are you hiding a secret from me, Mr. Palmer?
well, it's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I've been thinking of doing the same thing myself.
you are? -Yes, only in my case,
I have to be careful of heart strain and muscle fatigue.
how long have you been pumping?
I, I wouldn't call it pumping, doctor.
well, whatever they call it these days,
I'm impressed with you.
Really? -Yes, you've certainly got yourself in shape.
have you joined a gym?
a gym? Yeah, yes, yes, I have. Ah, uh, few months ago.
what have we got, Duck?
Ah, Mr. Palmer's initial assumption was correct.
lieutenant seabrook died of carbon monoxide poisoning.
tell me something I don't know.
the levels of C. O.In her blood
five times than fatal dose, yes.
she was probably rendered unconscious in less than 30 seconds.
not possible, unless she was...
she was breathing in the exhaust fumes directly from the tailpipe.
or someone pumped it into the vehicle.
which makes sense, in light of what else I found.
evidence of assault.
look at her wrists. They're bruised.
she was restrained.
and I also found what appear to be bite marks on her inner thighs and back.
run a rape kit. -I did.
that's when I found this.
an intrauterine device.
more commonly known as an I. U.D.
is it just me, or has anyone else wondered how they get those little things in there?
th, that probably sounded a lot more inappropriate than I meant.
do you think, Palmer? -As I was saying, when I ran the rape kit,
I found fresh male genetic material.
from last night or early this morning.
Abby's running the samples now.
I also found traces of engine oil and a particular kind of lotion on her hair and skin.
the main ingredient was pumice.
Grease-monkey soap. -Yeah.
except, her nails and hands are clean.
the skin is soft, no calluses to speak of. - Not her soap. -Yeah, she certainly wasn't a regular user.
Thanks, Duck.
did you learn nothing in that class this morning, Mr. Palmer?
jamie jones was arrested in 1998 for assault and battery on his girlfriend and...
she dropped the charges and married him six months later.
there's no accounting for taste.
look at Britney and K-Fed.
at least she was smart enough to ask for divorce.
so was jones' wife.
divorced three years ago.
Ooh, and there's a restraining order.
shocking. -Not on him.
he got it against his ex-wife.
lieutenant Seabrook wasn't alone at Azeon last night, boss.
she was with a mechanic.
Yeah. The Azeon security cameras caught it.
and there was evidence she was...
sexually assaulted.
Ducky thinks she was raped.
Yeah, check this out.
you get a warrant yet?
Yeah. Right here. Name's jamie jones.
Ziva and I were gonna pick him up.
not anymore. You're processing the lieutenant'apartment.
boss, what about me? -You get with Abby.
the C. O. Levels in that vehicle were off the charts.
you find out how he did it.
Ah. Letting me drive?
no, I'm meeting you there.
I need to drop something off at the hospital.
what? - A stool sample.
would you like to see it?
you want me to stab you in the eye with my knife?
Abby? -Over here.
over where? -Over down here.
I'm trying to decide if this is a yellow light or a red light situation.
you only wish I was still sexually harassing you.
so, uh, Gibbs wants us to figure out how so much C.O. got pumped into the vehicle's cabin.
okay, first of all, Mcgee, his name... is Otto.
O-T-T-O. It's a palindrome.
and second, he is so much more than a vehicle.
I've never seen programming like this.
it's complex, elegant, visionary.
it's way out of my league.
you? -I got lost about 50 lines in.
Seabrook was operating at a whole different level.
if they used the A. I.to sabotage or redirect the exhaust into the ventilation system, that could take us months to track.
make sure you tell Gibbs that.
I did.
I told him we needed help from the Azeon people.
how? Right now they're all suspects.
that's what he said.
great.
well, how long did he give us this time? - Today.
this is completely unacceptable.
when do we get our vehicle back?
when we're done with it. -Doing what?
figuring out how it was used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.
are all NCIS agents this stupid?
Mr. Engler, insulting our guest won't bring Otto back here any sooner.
of course. My apologies.
how long will it take for you to figure out Roni killed herself, Agent Gibbs?
who said she killed herself?
she was the only one down here this morning!
you mean except for you.
take a break.
I'll handle this.
well, you better, Russell.
he's opardizing the entire future of this company.
what he was trying to say was that this...
proof-of-concept test is make-or-break time for us, Agent Gibbs - Reschedule it. - I tried.
the D. O. won't budge on the dates.
dozens of teams are flying in from all over the world.
then you better help me find Lieutenant Seabrook's killer.
Where's your chief mechanic?
no. No, not possible.
he got along very well with Roni.
they were very good friends.
he sexually assaulted her in his garage last night.
that's definitely yellow light.
cytology tests take 72 hours, but...
Dr. House gets his results back in ten minutes.
it's ridiculous.
in the entertainment world, they call that "suspension of disbelief,"actually.
what are you doing here?
Oh, well, I was in the area, and I thought I would, uh, drop this off.
you found it. -Yes, I did.
thank you.
who's the guy lesting your neck？Over there.
Oh.-Just... curious.
am I detecting a little bit of jealousy here?
me? Jealous?
Yeah. Who was he?
he's gay.-Okay. Good.
what's next, insisting that I can't see other people?
Oh, no, that would...
that would just be cruel.
you're the one who was too busy to see me last night.
Yeah, and I'll make it up to you.
when?
tomorrow.
I promise. -Promise?
what's that, marking your territory? - Oh, just a reminder.
just until you make good on your promise.
looks like she did a trading spaces with John Nash.
Russell Crowe played him in A Beautiful Mind, that Ron Howard movie about the insane mathematician.
what kind of tests are you getting done?
why you worried about me?
you're keeping a paper bag filled with crap in your desk.
what do you think?
I think you should go and check the bedroom.
that is...
unless you want me to come with you...and help.
what?
just wondering if offering to take me to a bedroom constitutes sexual harassment.
well, if you have to ask, then it's not harassment.
Tony! Get in here!
I just found Jamie Jones.
untie me!
what do you think, Tony?
you saw the video of him assaulting Lieutenant Seabrook.
doesn't explain how he ended up tied to her bedposts with a ball gag in his mouth.
well, have you ever heard of accomplices?
am I catching you at a bad time?
uh, what can I do for you?
tomorrow night, I was thinking sushi, there's a great new place in Georgetown.
okay. -Well, don't sound so excited.
I'm at work.
but right, get it. Okay.
what part of inappropriate touching don't you understand?
test results came back already?
I'm pregnant.
McGee's gonna be very proud.
what are you looking at?
keep an eye on the jumpsuit.
this Seabrook's got a bunch of mp3 files on here.
all created over the last 24 hours.
you think she was illegally downloading?
no. They were recorded with the laptop's microphone.
I think she was making verbal observations while running her tests
I'm gonna line up the time-stamps.
she might have made a recording while she was dying.
so, she's in the passenger seat.
Probably...buckled her seat belt.
now, if she was tied to something, what would she be tied to?
McGee, help me!
McGee! Mcgee! help!
it won't open. The kill switch.
cover your face! - Come on.
permission to hug you.
you never have to ask, Abby.
what happened? -Get e chair.
I almost bought the farm, Mcgee.
I even saw that old lady telling me to run to the light.
boss, my back was only turned for a few seconds.
a few mores seconds, Mcgee, she'd be dead.
you okay? - Yeah.
I'm really lightheaded.
boss, evidence cage called in an emergency alert?
it was me, Dinoz. Stand down.
you attacked the car? -The car tried to kill Abby.
I think there was a short.
when I tried to unbuckle my seat belt, it pinned me back and the windows shut and the engines started.
it triggered all the doors in the car to lock.
and then the whole cabin filled up with exhaust.
a few minutes more,
I would've been singing hymns with my angels right now.
Abby, I'd have noticed before then.
then I would've hugged you, Mcgee.
so Lieutenant Seabrook was killed by a malfunction?
too many variables.
it was deliberate.
the Lieutenant was set up to look like suicide.
I think it's time you had a heart-to-heart with Jones, boss.
how'd he do it?
it's not a damn quiz, Mcgee!
find out! -On it.
What'd you say to jones? -Nothing.
he's been asking about Lieutenant Seabrook.
acting like she's still alive.
come on, Ducky's checking you out.
I'm fine, I just... - It's not a request, Abby.
this is not good.
look, this is all just a big misunderstanding, Agent Gibbs.
all you have to do is call one phone number, man.
lawyer? -No. Roni.
look, I know what it must have looked like back at her apartment...
lieutenant Seabrook's your girlfriend now?
Yeah.
look, we worked together for a few years, we started dating, maybe six months back.
dating? -Yeah.
what's that look like?
it's a stupid game, man.
only when we're alone.
you like games, Jones?
we're just role playing, all right?
it's not like we're freaks.
come on, man, am I going to lose my security clearance over this?
Hey, youlmost killed one of my people today!
what?
that damn Humvee you used to kill Lieutenant Seabrook.
Roni, what the hell are you talking about?
Roni is downstairs, Jones!
on a steel slab!
this is one of her jokes, right?
is she behind the glass? Huh?
because if you are, Roni, this isn't funny!
tell me it's not real.
I did it, Abby.
I know how they got in.
how'd you know I was here?
I didn't.
Abby, I'm sorry for... -I know.
thought you were supposed to ask for permission first.
never with you, Tim.
he's telling the truth.
just a quick test run and she's coming right back to him.
right with you, Abs.
the reason that we couldn't find how they hacked the AI program was they didn't.
they snuck in before the system was even on-line.
makes sense.
there were a series of commands inserted into the flash memory of the BIOS at bootup.
they waited until the conditions were met, and then, bam, killer car syndrome.
once executed, they purged from memory.
the only trace left, an extra space on one of the mother board's bio chips.
figured it'd be something like that.
right.
we know the program was flashed.
the only trace left, an extra space on one of the mother board's bio chips.
memory stick. SD card.
we just need to find it.
and when we do, we'll have the killer code and a clue to who wrote it.
I think we lost him. We need to try it again but slower.
so what you're saying, for example, is we need to find something this small in a Humvee jammed with $22 million worth of electronics.
pretty much.
we're screwed.
now that is an excellent point.
you wanted to see me?
you have plans tonight, Tony.
actually no. Tomorrow, I'm going to...
it wasn't a question.
we've had these three under observation ever since you tagged their bags at the airport.
they made reservations for dinner tonight here.
the reservation is for four.
I want to know who they're meeting with.
excellent.
I've always wanted to try the food at this place, but it's a little outside of my price range.
you won't be inside.
we couldn't risk them I. D.ing you as the baggage handler from the airport.
so what's the plan?
we're going to take a more covert approach on this one.
Oh, I ever tell you covert's my middle name?
in my perspective,
I see the people from the big jet plane, the woman looks Teutonic, she drinks a vodka tonic and two bald men sit with her waiting for a fourth they're not going to order that main course until that person come...
hey...
everybody's a critic.
Am-scray.
get out of here.
keep your eyes on the prize, Tango Eight.
I may even let you keep the money you're making.
sorry, I just do what I can...
you're not going to sing the whole thing, are you?
I gotta do what I gotta do
I'm just a man, oh, speaking of man, another man walks through that front door wearing a polka-dot scarf, will he join the table?
I don't know, yes, he greets the woman, what do they say?
who knows? He's sitting at the table with the other people from the plane. - Stay steady on the target, Tango 8.
I want his photo. Isolate and freeze-frame.
they are having a conversation a heavy, heavy conversation that man talk, a-talk, a-talk a lot talk, a-talk, a-talk a lot， Jenny, think I've been made? Do you see what I see?
relax, Tango 8.
I'm sure he's just checking his reflection in the glass.
Hey, what was that movie where they took the whole car apart?
I am not tony.
come on. You know the one They were looking for heroin...
and they took apart that entire car?
still not tony.
ab, I think I found it.
that's it. That's the kill program.
Yes! -That's a od job.
now put it back together.
as in now.
Gibbs, what's the rush?
the Director just assured the Secretary of the Navy we were handling this thing with kid gloves.
well, we didn't get that memo 'cause you know, we're wearing latex.
they want a team from Azeon to come by, check and make sure we did't break anything.
When?-Two hours.
boss, it took us ten just to take it apart.
Yeah, that's why I brought you help.
and Roni would be in tears if she saw Otto like this.
can you do it or not, Jones? Let him go.
does he have to run?
it'd be nice.
you all right?
define all right.
find out the results from the medical tests yet?
not yet.
time's the Azeon team getting here?
40 minutes ago. You fell asleep.
Gibbs and Jenny are stalling them in her office now.
if you've discovered the problem with the vehicle, we can fix it.
was't a problem. It was sabotage.
by whom?
an expert in artificial intelligence.
then it wasn't Jamie.
it must be one of the companies we're competing against.
they, they know they can't beat us in a fair fight.
the winner of the drive-off gets the entire D. O.D. contract, Director Shepard, not just the Navy's.
the Navy's banking on you, doctor.
it's why I've agreed to the secretary's request that you visually inspect Otto.
when?
right how if you'd like.
agent Gibbs, would you mind escorting us?
where is Otto?
we have let a robot-killer Humvee loose on the streets of Washington.
uh, technically, Director, it's a second-generation, fully...
I don't care what it's called!
find it! Fast.
bolo, on it, boss.
I'll take the beltway!
Abby and I will see if we can access Otto's system remotely.
I think I might be able to help with that.
someone had to send Otto a remote command and navigational data.
all we have to do is find it so we can back-trace it to our bad guy.
if we access the vehicle, can we remotely operate it?
Yeah, I've seen Roni do it before.
how? -I don't know, man.
I'm just a mechanic, all right?
all this A. I. stuff is way out of my league.
okay, what's your job during test runs?
I monitor stuff like tire pressure, Fuel injectors... -How?
I have my own program.
I mean, I could try. -Do it.
all right. But even if I can get in, all I can tell you is stuff like oil pressure and fuel levels.
Nagation, external sensors, that's all handled by scientists.
all right, I'm in. Now what?
just sit back and let the scientists...
...kick all kinds of major ass.
Roni would've really liked you guys.
okay, abby, we're in sync.
you are now following the same stream back into Otto as Jamie's program.
Jamie, what'the most complex sensor you monitor with this?
I'd say fuel injectors.
and when something goes wrong, do you just monitor it, or is there something you can actually do?
I have the ability to tweak some of the parameters to avoid engine damage.
that's our way in. Is that program on here, too?
Yeah, it's right there.
great. Before we were just receiving.
now we can send. Tweak something.
all right. What? -It doesn't matter.
I just need to follow it downstream back into otto.
okay. Um...
how's that?
I'm in.
pull up the navigation subdirectory.
accessing Otto's onboard GPS.
it's stopped.
it's right off Route 123 in Fairfax.
go, Mcgee.
I'll keep working on back-tracing the guy who sent him there.
clear!
they took our chip, boss.
when I told you to put this car back together,
I didn't mean put it back together with the only piece of evidence we have on the killer.
I didn't. We put in a copy.
Abby's got the original. Otto has five stereo cameras.
hoping one of them got a picture of our guy.
we're definitely dealing with someone on the inside.
he knew where all of Otto's cameras were.
the only shot I got is this.
this thing takes worse pictures than you do, Mcgee.
they went to a lot of trouble to get the chip back. Why?
like you said, it's the only evidence we have.
they know we can link it to 'em. how?
there weren't any prints on the surface.
the program's in assembly language. I'm not sure.
I back-traced the connection used to activate Otto.
they're in Azeos network. They're online right now.
I even have their...Gibbs?
don't worry, Jamie. We are going to get this guy.
you're sure about this, Agent Gibbs?
we sure about this, Mcgee?
Abby gave me the specific I. P. Address for the computer used to access Otto.
I'll know it when I find it.
which one was it?
we're working on it.
boss?
I. P. Address matches this one.
bastard! You killed her!
get him off me!
what's the matter? You couldn't share the limelight?
why would I kill Seabrook?
you've been jealous of Roni from the moment you met her.
that's ridiculous! If anythg, she was jealous of me.
I demand to know what proof you have against me.
this.
a flash chip?
it was used to kill Lieunant Seabrook.
the one you took from the vehicle was a copy.
then let me see the code.
everyone here has their own specific style.
I can tell you with certainty who wrote that one.
as can I, Engler? May I?
you're mistaken, Agent Gibbs, this chip is blank.
let him go.
boss?
let him go. He's the one who found Seabrook.
if he wanted the chip back, he would have taken it before anyone got there.
Dr. Pike...
the only thing you erased from this chip are my photos.
the real chip in the evidence locker at NCIS.
she thought of you like a father!
she was supposed to take the morning off, Jamie.
it was an accident.
I would never...never.
who was supposed to drive Otto that morning?
me. You... senile old fool, you were trying to kill me.
I did it for all of us.
he owns half the company.
when Otto wins that race, we would have been stuck working with him forever.
nobody deserves that.
that smug bastard.
if "red light" is for sexually assaulting a coworker, what color is for murder?
uh...how's "black light" sound?
works for me.
Hey.
it's late, go home.
just doing a little resech.
on what?
y. Pestis.
a very nasty illness.
it can cause permanent damage to the heart, lungs and kidneys, and in some cases, patients can relapse months or even years later.
Tony had it.
I know, Ziva, I was there.
did you know that he had some tests done recently?
and he's been wearing a hospital bracelet on his wrist.
no.
I asked him why, but he won't tell me.
he's probably got a pretty good reason. - So, uh...can I take this off now?
I haven't made up my mind yet.
okay.
you do know that it's for the psych ward, right?
Oh, yeah.
I picked it out special for you.
come on, take a guess. - I don't know.
then we're just going to have to settle this with facts.
I am Googling "men's jacket." What would you say it was made of?
it felt like butter. - Lambskin.
who's the designer? - Why do you assume I know?
because.
because? Because I'm a woman? Because I'm Jewish?
because you're a great detective.
true. McGee flashed the label when he showed us his lining.
Armani.
anything else?
Lizard-embossed trim, a two-way zipper, and a chest pocket.
found it. It's from the Armani 2007 Resort Collection. You can purchase it for...
$2, 000. They say the clothes make the man.
Yeah, he's not a man, he's a McGee.
either way, where is he?
uh... over there, overdressed.
you okay?
Yeah. I,um,
I just need to talk to Special Agent Gibbs.
Hey, your, uh, jacket's really soft.
Thanks.
who is McGee escorting?
I don't know; never seen him before.
this is Special Agent Gibbs.
lieutenant Sanders, sir.
I need you to investigate a murder.
Whose?
mine.
this is killing me. I feel like I know him.
Mossad? - Maybe.
internet dating?
I will kill you 18 different ways with this paper clip.
Ducky figure out what's wrong with Lieutenant Sanders, boss?
no, he's still examining him. Thinks it could be radiation poisoning.
do we know how he was exposed?
no, but he's got a high-risk job as an inspector for the IAEA.
international Atomic Energy Agency.
I wonder if he's been to Israel.
I feel like I know him from somewhere.
DiNozzo, check his travel.
is this guy contagious, boss?
well, McGee better hope not.
underwear, too? - Yes, McGee, I need everything.
don't you think that's kind of overkill?
get over it, McGee. I'm a scientist, remember?
you said he coughed on you?
Yes.
so I need to check all of your clothing for radiation.
if you were exposed...
Yeah, I feel exposed.
Where's your jacket?
come on, you need to test that, too?
you said he grabbed your arm.
will you promise not to stain it?
I promise not to stain it.
table's cold.
none of my other patients ever complained.
sorry, I thout it might be nice for you to have someone to talk to for a change.
Oh, I always talk to my guests.
the difference here is that you talk back.
talk about what? - Let's see.
in your case, I'd talk about your runner's physique, your well-toned calves, your impressive thighs.
it doesn't sound quite so personal when you're dead.
Mr. Palmer.
Yes, I will label these and get them over to radiobiology.
when did the nausea start?
two days ago.
since I'd been traveling, I blamed it on the local moqueca.
until your hair started falling out.
Ah, Jethro.
we have to wait for radiobiology to find out exactly with what we're dealing.
containment? - Minimal.
Abby's preliminary findings show that they're alpha emissions which, unlike gamma rays and X rays, can be blocked by a simple layer of dead cells on the skin.
just avoid contact and exchange of fluids.
is he fit to answer questions? - I'm right here.
I can hear you.
I'm sorry; it's force of habit.
you're around uranium in your job. What makes you think this was murder and not accidental?
the radiation badge.
it's a thermoluminescent dosimeter.
I wore it to inspect the power plant in Brazil where we discovered violations.
when I returned four days ago, the film from my badge was processed.
and the glow curve? - Detected no exposure.
said everything was fine.
were the Brazilians aware of your findings?
from my line of questioning, I'd say they knew they were busted.
brazil has a history of covert attempts to secure nuclear weaponry with Germany's aid.
Yeah, it's an unsavory partnership that goes back to the fall of the Third Reich.
I'll need access to your offices and your inspection team.
I told transpo I want to move him to AFRRI.
that's the Armed Forc... - Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute.
although in my line of work, we call it something else.
what's that?
the last exit.
okay, ready? Look away now. Look at me, close your eyes.
now look back really fast. Open 'em up. Anything?
n-no, still nothing. - Okay, squat down.
squat down, close your eyes, and then jump up and look.
Ziva, you find out how you know the lieutenant?
not yet. He's been to Israel twice in the past decade. We've never been in the same city.
he's also been to Iran, Bulgaria, Pakistan, Kuwait, Croatia, Korea, and Slovenia.
guy gets around. - I left out Canada.
Ducky's transferring him to AFRRI in Bethesda. Ziva, go with him.
protection detail?
not sure yet. DiNozzo.
on it; tracing his phone calls, bank accounts, everyone he's ever met in his entire life.
leave that to McGee. You're with me.
uh, McGee's not here. - Where the hell is McGee?
Abby is testing my clothes for radiation, and it is taking longer than we thought, so...
pick up where DiNozzo left off. - Got it, boss.
if clothes make the man, what does that make McGee?
male nurse? - No.
aqua Smurf.
I've e-mailed your records to the doctors at AFRRI. They'll be running more tests.
try to conserve your energy.
you'll need it later.
I don't want to see you back on my cold table.
I appreciate your help, Doc.
good luck.
forget something, Doc?
special Agent Gibbs asked me to accompany you. I'm Officer David.
I'd, uh, shake your hand, but...
um, actually, it would be best to avoid all bodily contact.
you sound just like my prom date.
would you mind smiling for me?
do I have something in my teeth? - No.
you can stop smiling.
I'm sorry. - Don't be.
do we know each other?
Where'd you go to college?
israel.
could we have met at a conference? - Yes.
except I've never been to one.
burning Man, 2002. Extreme Twister Camp.
I don't even know what that means.
it took two hours, but I finally found three seats on a nonstop Lufthansa flight to Gdansk. You leave next Thursday...
Holly, I don't know even if we'll be making this trip.
I'll know more after I talk to NCIS. Special Agent Gibbs.
okay, well, the sooner the better because there's cancellation fees...
I understand; just leave the itinery. - I'm Mark Sadowski. We spoke on the phone.
Diane, NCIS is here.
which one is Lieutenant Sanders' desk?
it's clean.
I can see that.
he means they swept the office, DiNozzo.
when Roy said he was throwing up, we checked the radiation levels. They're within normal limits.
I'll gather his things.
Hi. I'm Diane Russio.
how's Roy? - Transferred to AFRRI.
we were hoping it was just food poisoning.
radiation.
do you know where he was exposed? - No, not yet.
well, it couldn't have been Brazil. We toured the facility together, and Diane and I aren't sick.
could meone have done this on purpose?
I'll need your radiation badges. - Of course.
after hours in Brazil, did all of you stick together?
uh, we stayed in the same hotel, ate the same food.
Roy would get up early and run.
Oh, the night before we left, we hit the local bars for a cerveza and a cigar. Roy left early.
alone? - I was with him.
we just went straight back to the hotel.
I'm 30 years older than both of them and they're the ones who are too tired to party.
I'll go get my badge.
so can we visit Roy?
Yeah, if he wants to see you.
answers, Abs. - I got 'em, Gibbs.
I took Lieutenant Sanders' dosimeter apart, and I discovered that it is hinky.
I-I might even call it hinky-dory.
Oh, come on, Gibbs, it's a little cute.
okay, um...
if you follow this red beam, you can see there's no clear path between the photomultiplier tubes and the crystal lattice.
this little piece of plastic is blocking the light emissions.
sabotage? - Or faulty manufacturing.
I mean, it's a state-of- the-art lifesaving device, but it's still made from injection-molded plastic just like a, um, Happy Meal toy.
and you know how sometimes you get one of those and you have to bend it back and forth...
somebody needs a Happy Meal. - What about these?
um, these are operational. No globs.
their reading was a true positive. My conclusion is that Sanders had a bad badge.
there was no foul play. If he hadn't gotten sick, he wouldn't have even noticed.
I need to talk to Ducky.
Hey, Duck.
Jethro, I was just about to call you.
lieutenant Sanders wasn't poisoned at the power plant.
I know. The radiobiology lab identified the isotope in his blood.
it was thallium.
wow, that is nasty stuff.
isn't the nonradioactive form of that used for rat poison?
Yes, it's lethal and extremely effective:
colorless, odorless, tasteless, and soluble in water.
are you thinking ingestion? - Most likely.
and-and no longer than 72 hours ago.
okay, so now we know the "when."
we just have to figure out why, how and who.
the pigment, Prussian blue, has been applied by artists since the 1700s.
Yeah, it was used by van Gogh, Monet, Picasso.
me.
how long until it takes effect?
about 24 hours.
prussian blue works best when it's used or taken as a preventative measure before exposure or right after.
but in the meantime, let's see if you can replace the fluids you lost without an I. V.
we prefer oral feeding to maintain the integrity of your gut.
my gut has integrity.
so does my spleen.
now, you can eat anything you want, just so long as it's low-microbial.
but no drinking, no smoking.
are we done? - One more thing.
we need to keep his stress levels down.
we're in the middle of an investigation... - We're in the middle of an investigation...
I have to go.
any place I can get some fresh air?
this facility has an open-air garden.
they catch it in time?
uh, unclear. The next 24 hours are key.
I'm more interested in the past.
I want a list of every sip, every bite, every kiss, every time he's hit the head in the past 72 hours.
do you think he's hiding something?
have you placed him yet?
no.
you place him first, Ziva.
trust later.
there were only trace amounts of radiation on your clothes, but I'm still glad we tested them.
cause it's better to be safe than glowing.
Where's my jacket? - It's here.
it's really soft.
if you rubbed that against a certain part of your body...
you didn't. - I don't even have that part.
thank you for taking good care of my jacket.
you're welcome.
what?
I promised you I wouldn't stain it.
just put your hand over it, like this.
it looks very natural. Thank you.
so did you find anything in the stuff Tony took from the lieutenant's desk?
nothing yet. I'm checking all the protein bars for needle-puncture marks.
think the killer injected them with thallium?
that's what I'd . it's pretty devious.
using something so healthy to make someone so sick.
so the rest of the pizza is inside your refrigerator?
Yeah. You can test it, but I, for one, trust Papa Don implicitly.
then what? - I brushed my teeth.
and then I went to bed. I was pretty jet-lagged, the next morning.
what time? - 05:30.
I thought I was the only one who got up that early to exercise.
Nope.
had water from the tap and an energy gel. Raspberry.
noted.
then I ran the two miles from my apartment to the Custis Trail, - which runs along the... - The Potomac.
right. Then I headed over the...
the Arlington Memorial Bridge, where you passed a woman wearing a yellow Windbreaker.
is she part of the plot? - No, she's me!
you're the one who wears the fluorescent orange watch cap when you run, correct?
right, yeah, so the cars will notice me.
people, too. I pass you every morning. I'm going east, you're going west.
don't you recognize me?
I'm sorry, no. - How about now?
I mean, you've got to picture me sweating and panting and, you know...
Yeah, of course, I know you.
Yeah, you have a smooth stride, great carriage.
I often turn after you pass to admire your technique.
are you serious? - Yeah. Yeah.
you have a very cute, tight technique.
how far did you run that morning?
eight miles. Went home, showered, and headed to the field office.
ate two protein bars at my desk.
then at 12:00, Mark and I headed to Oakwood Shooting Range.
Where's that? - Near Andrews.
what do you shoot? - Glock.
mark and I ate lunch while we took target practice.
I had a bacon cheeseburger with fries, washed down with a large coffee.
you run like a health nut and eat like a slob.
I've always weighed the same.
people told me at 40, my body would change.
I guess I might not have to worry about that.
have you made a will?
I'm sorry, that was too blunt. Um...
no, no, no. I like blunt.
I was thinking your beneficiary would have a potential motive.
the joke's on them, because I...
I don't have a will.
mark Sadowski, senior member of the team, is about to retire. You know what that means.
he gets a watch?
no, somebody's going to bump him off. Standard procedure in '70s cop flicks.
did Sadowski and Sanders get along?
worked together nine years.
neither filed a complaint or requested a transfer.
what about the other inspector?
Ah, Diane Russio. Something's up with her.
she made Gibbs' spidey sense tingle.
whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, hey, hey! Don't touch that.
Sanders' car could be a hot zone.
this car? I doubt it.
rem is low. It's safe.
after you, probie.
reeks of cigar.
it's a manly scent, good for you.
you know what this guy being poisoned reminds me of?
a movie? - Yeah, but what movie?
a movie I've never seen?
D. O.A. it's called. 1950 film noir classic.
this accountant goes to San Francisco, parties all night, wakes up, finds he's poisoned.
he has 24 hours to find his... - Found something.
is it dangerous? - Do you want kids?
kidding.
rem count's not that high. We should take it to X ray.
let's see what we got in here.
body parts? - Gym clothes.
get them to Abby. - Ziva called with a list of Lieutenant Sanders' movements
where he went, what he ate.
we'll start at his apartment, collect these items, sweep for radiation.
Ziva figure out how she knew him?
personal connection.
Ziva has personal connections?
lieutenant.
did I startle you?
a little.
I'd say I was paranoid, but someone just poisoned me.
who?
well, I've racked my brain for enemies at work, but I...
I can't think of anyone.
what about your private life?
do you have a girlfriend?
are you asking me in a professional capacity? - Yes.
I don't have one.
why not? Professional follow-up.
well, I wouldn't date anyone I worked with, and outside of work, I've never met a woman who could understand why I do what I do.
the focus, the risks, the sacrifices.
they always want me to go teach or go to law school.
but I love what I do.
I truly believe there are good guys who need protection and bad guys who need monitoring.
it's a mission, not a job.
that's my favorite quote, ever.
sorry. Felt a little dizzy.
I have to get you into bed.
I'm not saying anything.
sorry, it's the English.
how long do you think he's going to be in here?
Hey! - Roy!
Hi.
I'm sorry, no contact.
I can't believe this happened.
you going to be all right?
well, I hope so.
we'll probably just cancel next week's trip.
which one?
pakistan, Uzbekistan and Russia.
it's one of those "If this is Tuesday, it must be Tashkent" trips.
don't cancel.
see if Howard's available. He's a good man.
careful.
sorry. I'm a...
I'm a bit wiped out.
Oh, we'll let you get some rest. See you tomorrow, okay?
I need to talk to you. It's about Lieutenant Sanders' personal life.
he doesn't have a girlfriend, that he doesn't date, either.
hard to believe, but I think it's true.
Mr. Sadowski, would you mind giving us a moment alone?
I'll be at the elevators.
you know something. It's about Brazil.
when you two went back to the hotel together.
Roy tell you about that?
no, my boss did. What happened?
nothing.
tell me.
nothing.
I got a little drunk, I knocked on his door, he wouldn't let me in.
I was a complete idiot, and he was a complete gentleman.
or maybe he's gay. - Oh, I don't think he's gay.
how do you know?
I saw the way he looked at you.
the higher levels of radiation are due to the concentration of Lieutenant Sanders' sweat.
he made his clothes radioactive, not vice versa.
ABS, it's over.
I just hate to see the first one of the morning end.
I did get one unexpected piece of information.
lieutenant Sanders had a computerized chip in his left sneaker to log his workouts.
that one of those experimental DOD things?
uh, no. You can buy them at any running store.
it transmits into this.
I was able to access his exercise logs.
these are the last two weeks of his workout.
he's a machine.
eight miles every day in under an hour.
lieutenant Sanders was poisoned... - Right around here.
his last two workouts, they were only slightly off pace.
does that tell you something about the case?
tells me something about the man.
like what?
like he would have made a damn good Marine.
he's sleeping again?
we took a walk around the garden, and it knocked him out.
we got the second test results back.
was the Prussian blue effective?
no.
lieutenant Sanders' lymphocytes are continuing to decrease, and his radiation levels are higher than when he was admitted.
that doesn't make any sense.
it does if he's still being poisoned.
there's no mistake, Gibbs. The doctor said Lieutenant Sanders' radiation levels are increasing.
he's still being poisoned.
someone wanted to finish the job.
not a lot of people have access to him: nurses, doctors...
people preparing his food. Could be a lot.
Plus, he had two visitors from work yesterday: Diane Russio and Mark Sadowski.
were they alone with him?
Yes.
at one point, I went to the vending machine.
one of them could have slipped it in his water.
what about Tony and McGee? Have they followed up on the list of locations?
swept Sanders' apartment, office, running path yesterday. All clean.
they'll hit the rest today.
this is starting to look very targeted, Gibbs.
whoever did this is not just after any nuclear inspector.
Sanders know he's still being poisoned?
not yet. I'm worried it will increase his stress.
your call. You stick with him, Ziva.
like tattoos on Abby.
I think this will make you feel better. They tested the pizza inside the refrigerator and, um...
you were right about Papa Don.
Yes!
exonerated. Did they, um...
did they find any clues, any answers?
not yet. But they're still looking.
well, tell them to hurry up. I want to know who killed me before I die.
can you do something else for me?
of course.
can you find me a lawyer?
I think I need to write my will.
mark and Roy came here a couple of times a week.
usually at lunchtime.
you check out Roy's two perfect targets hanging inside?
missed them. Which station did they use?
we don't keep track. At lunchtime, it's first available.
but if you really need to know, I got a security camera.
insurance made me put it in last year after I got sued.
personal injury? - Sexual harassment.
see, I like to... come up behind a shooter and correct his stance.
most appreciate it.
one guy from Utah didn't. Bet I could correct your stance.
I'm okay with my stance.
sure like to teach you how to position your shoulders over your hips.
maybe we should get the security footage and review it back at the office to see where they were.
no need. I think we just found our hot zone.
I have been working for 30 hours straight.
this is only my fourth cup of the day.
Mossad. Hot liquid. I'd let her have it, McGee.
Thanks.
so you spend the night in the Lieutenant's room, huh?
Yes. We stayed up late, talking.
Yeah, I remember staying up late in college...talking.
what's that look on your face?
what look?
are you falling in love with a dying man? - Of course not.
Hey.
the look on your face says you are.
when did you become an expert on love?
last time I checked, your idea of a long-term commitment was a three-day weekend.
what's that look on your face?
nothing. I was just going to say that...
look, I know what you were going to say.
the next time Lieutenant Sanders and I stay up late "talking," we're going to use a lead condom.
thank you. - No, Ziva...
I was going to say, I hope he pulls through.
but you should know that I found a photo of an attractive woman, a kid, and a husky in his desk.
how'd he ingest the thallium?
well, they ate lunch at the shooting range and Abby's combing through the physical evidence, but we still haven't found the smoking gun.
we swept the Dumpsters at the shooting range, but the levels were low. Same with the kitchen.
there were two food preparers, two servers. They all scanned clean.
so did Dee Dee, and she's the rather eccentric woman who runs the place.
then Roy, I'm sorry,
lieutenant Sanders must have been contaminated at the point of consumption.
I think someone spiked his hamburger or his coffee.
who got near his food?
I watched the security footage, and Mark Sadowski is with him the whole time, but you can't see see the table or the food. The cameras are trained on the shooting stalls.
Oh, believe me, you don't want to know why that is.
someone could have come from the back and not been seen.
Sadowski was at the range and he was here, which places him at both contamination sites.
bring him in. - On it, boss.
I thought I told you to stay with Lieutenant Sanders the whole time.
agent Lee's with him. He's making out his will.
can't die unless you see a lawyer.
Hey.
he may not die.
he may pull through.
officer David, I need you to witness the document.
in case you're wondering, I left it all to my sister.
I hope she appreciates it. We fight a lot.
someday I'll tell you about my family.
Yeah, well, don't wait too long.
does your sister have a husky? - How'd you know?
it is a nice addition to any family.
do you have a dog?
no.
I'll file this with the court.
but I hope we don't need to execute it for a very long, long time.
thank you, Agent Lee. - You're welcome.
Ziva, Abby sent back some of his things.
you know a lot about handling radioactive materials.
sure, for my job.
you were at the shooting range with Lieutenant Sanders a few days ago.
Yeah, we had lunch.
you slipped him a little thallium.
I've never touched thallium.
look, I had nothing to do with Roy getting poisoned. Nothing.
skip the denials, tell me why.
there's nothing to tell. - This is my favorite part.
the part where Gibbs breaks him?
no, the part right before Gibbs breaks him, when the guy still thinks he has a chance.
Why?
there is no "why." - Why?
I didn't do it! I would never hurt Roy.
sit down.
he's my friend. We've traveled the world together.
when I thought I had prostate cancer, he was the first person I called.
so if you have any proof I did this, lay it out for me. Let me see it.
cause I know it doesn't exist.
he'll break him.
I finished analyzing the debris that I vacuumed from the shooting range gravel.
was it our prime suspect?
you mean...
Frenchie? No.
the fry registered scant radioactivity after it was dusted.
none of the larger items were contaminated, but the micro debris was through the roof.
were you able to break down its component?
well, it took me a while, but I isolated human skin, human hair, lint, tobacco ash, both large and small, salt, pepper, dirt, and pollen.
he's gone.
I gotta go, too.
I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go.
make it fast, Duck.
we found the smoking gun, with the emphasis on "smoking."
Abby isolated large radioactive ash from the debris from the shooting range.
it wasn't ingestion, it was inhalation.
someone injected the thallium into the cigar.
Yes, it's very efficient, too, because the lungs feed directly into the bloodstream.
Sadowski mentioned hitting the bars with Lieutenant Sanders in Brazil for a cerveza and a cigar. So...
wait, boss, I need to show you something.
I really hope it's not that YouTube clip I sent him this morning 'cause it's a little...
now, I downloaded the security camera feed from the shooting range.
here's the isolated footage of Mark Sadowski and Lieutenant Sanders.
if you had laced a cigar with thallium, would you stick around to breathe in the smoke.
it's not likely. It's like pulling the pin on a grenade, handing it to someone and then standing beside them.
Sadowski didn't know they were contaminated with radiation.
no, stay here.
explains why you couldn't break him. He didn't do it.
where are they? - What are you talking about?
the cigars you smoke when you go outside to get some fresh air.
okay, I had a puff or two. I know the doctor said not to.
No! Where are they?
I had no idea you were so anti-smoking.
I mean, honestly, at this point, I'd consider myself lucky to live long enough to die of cancer.
look, Roy, these cigars are laced with thallium.
were they a gift?
I, uh... I bought them myself, duty-free, Sao Paulo airport.
who else had access to these?
they were in my desk until I stuck them in my bag.
Oh, man.
okay, okay, you need to relax. You need to stay calm.
it's all right, Roy. It's all right.
deep breaths now, take deep breaths.
keep breathing.
two out of three inspectors poisoned. Someone's targeting the agency.
make a lot of enemies wherever they've been, boss.
or wherever they're going. You stick with Sadowski, DiNozzo.
McGee, get Diane Russio in here. She's the only inspector who isn't sick.
yet.
we do a dozen inspections a year, Agent Gibbs.
in a dozen different countries.
people don't like us, but I can't believe any government would sanction this.
thank you.
we all got tested after Roy. My results were negative.
am I still at risk?
low-level exposure. Lieutenant Sanders was the target.
you have an inspection next week?
Roy insisted we still go, but now that Mark's sick...
where? - That's classified.
we prefer it if they don't know we're coming.
need to know.
russia, Pakistan and Uzbistan.
names of the facilities?
mtac Operations. - I need satellite time.
I'll get the schedule, sir. When do you need it? - Now.
last one, boss. Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
image of the Tashkent reactor stabilizing.
before the fall of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan was the top producer of weapons-grade materials.
yeah? And After?
they dismantled the centrifuge, but if they wanted to put it back together...
they'd bring the pieces in with heavy equipment trucks, like these.
lot of activity.
looks like they're building something.
or pulling it down.
I need a shot from earlier this week.
try the same location 96 hours ago.
accessing now.
someone's expecting guests.
get that footage to DOD and IAEA headquarters in Vienna.
DiNozzo. - Hey.
someone tipped off Uzbekistan.
ask Sadowski who knew.
Sadowski's out of it, boss. The doctor sedated him.
lieutenant Sanders, then. - Checking.
McGee, I want bank records for everyone working at the agency.
I want details for every inspection ever done on that facility.
feel like I'm running a marathon. - You are.
I called my parents. Mom's taking it bad.
the good news is, Dad's going to fix it.
they're on their way here, and he's going to turn it all around.
call in some favors. - Ask the right questions.
because every problem has a solution. - Exactly.
God, he sounds a lot like my father.
he was tough on me, but I made him proud.
do they have far to travel?
too far.
they'll need to be here anyway. Decisions to make.
I'd like for you to meet them.
is that weird? - No.
I would like to meet them.
how is he?
HD's fighting. - Gibbs has a question for him.
I think he just fell asleep.
lieutenant?
lieutenant Sanders? - Ziva?
I'm here. Agent DiNozzo needs to ask you a question.
who knew you were going to Uzbekistan next week?
classified.
who decided where you'd go?
my decision. Short list.
kept everyone guessing.
but who did you tell?
Roy? Lieutenant?
who did you tell, Roy?
mark. Told Mark.
you done?
who else did you tell?
Roy? Anyone else?
Diane. Just...
just Mark and Diane.
Diane. Okay.
thank you.
Hey, boss, the Lieutenant says only two others knew he was going to Uzbekistan.
mark Sadowski and Diane Russio.
how is he?
he's fading fast.
boss, inspectors have been back to Uzbekistan six times in the past four years.
next week's inspection would have been lucky number seven. Sanders has been at every one of them.
makes him an expert.
if anything had changed, he's the guy that would have noticed.
explains why they targeted him.
what makes you think it was them, McGee?
Dr. Mallard. - Hey, Doc.
I need you to check something. - Uh-huh.
the other side.
well, you know you've been in the hospital too long when you've figured out the vending machine.
you think I've been here too long?
you want some of this?
that's Roy's sister.
the woman in the photo, the one with the kid and the dog.
I had to ask him, Ziva. - I know.
are you okay? - Part of me just wants to run.
you know, I can't believe this is happening to me. To me, of all people.
well, you shouldn't take it as a sign of weakness.
well, then how should I take it, Tony?
Character-building? Life-affirming?
somehow I don't think Roy sees it that way.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I'm dying of boredom in there.
it's okay, I got you.
hey...
what's a guy got to do to get a pretty girl to take a walk in the garden?
Roy, you shouldn't be out of bed. You need to be back in bed.
it's okay, Doctor, I can manage. - No, no, no, he needs to be back in...
Dr. Hass, excuse me. Can I speak to you for a second?
I think... I think I may have been exposed.
I don't know how, and I don't mean to be an alarmist, but I got the burning sensation and the headaches and the vomiting and the...
whole thing. - Diarrhea? You got the diarrhea?
Yeah, like a tap, and it just hit me, and I...
okay, let's, uh, sit you down. We're going to need to run some tests.
Ah, Jethro.
as per your request, I've reviewed the results of the tests carried out on the agency staff after it was confirmed that the Lieutenant had been exposed. And I...
I found what you were looking for.
trace amounts of ferric ferrocyanide. Prussian blue.
someone was taking it prophylactically.
as a preventative measure, Jethro.
who?
her.
got her, boss. $50, 000 in cash deposited over the past three months.
closed the account this morning.
shifted the funds offshore. Looks like she's about to do a runner.
where is she now? - Just checked. Still in the office.
no, I don't want to travel via London. I want a direct flight.
Yeah. Yes, I know it's last minute, but I...
look, there must be other carriers...
miss Russio? - Agent Gibbs.
your travel coordinator, Holly Stegman...
okay, she just left me here with this mess flight plans...
which way? - I'm trying to...
which way?!
parking garage.
come on.
stop!
stop!
no.
no. Wait. W-Wait.
out of the car. - No.
I didn't mean to do it.
I couldn't kill Roy any more than I could run over you!
I wanted to make him sick so he couldn't travel, that's all.
he would have known.
he would have realized it was either Mark or me.
just tell me... Wait!
tell me I didn't kill him.
no... I didn't mean to kill him.
she could have killed you, boss.
what a perfect day for a run.
I'd even consider a double loop.
I have something of yours.
I remember you now.
all those mornings, I ran right past you.
you blasted past me.
I, uh...
I used to put in a little extra kick to impress the ladies.
well, it worked.
I'm sorry we never got to run together.
me, too.
do you think you would have noticed that I was no longer there?
that I'd stopped running?
Yes, I would have noticed.
I would have missed seeing you.
but eventually, you would have forgotten me.
Yes.
I won't forget you now.
you bring it?
you're doing the right thing.
I know I'm doing the right thing. I'm just...
I'm still not sure you're the one I should be doing it with.
you're not exactly a man with many options.
Hey. Come on.
get down!
you hit?
what's wrong with this picture?
you mean aside from the Director being out at 4: 00 A. M.
and a dead homeless man in her car?
no, that about covers it.
not quite.
his alley-mates don't think he's homeless.
said he showed up last night.
he looked dirty, but smelled like he had just taken a bath.
said he didn't talk to anyone.
he talked to somebody.
it's a nice phone.
the Director's on another op.
if she is, I'm not in on it.
would you tell us if you were?
name's Troy Webster. He had information I needed.
the frog.
getting La Grenouille on Ares is off-limits but with what Webster had, I could have still nailed Grenouille to the wall.
and the reason I'm finding out about this right now...
or you gonna quote Rule Number Four to me again?
are you gonna quote Rule Number One back at me?
what were you doing out here alone?
I can take care of myself, Jethro. -Right.
who was taking care of him?
well, from this point forward, that would be me.
well, it's not anything I said.
any witnesses get an I. D. on the vehicle?
all I got is some kind of truck.
plates were missing.
it was a dark limited edition, Ford Excursion.
tinted windows. Off-road tires. Broken taillight.
and, uh...now missing a rear window.
you got off a few rounds.
I don't take kindly to being shot at.
was he shooting at you or him?
being Director of NCIS is a high-value target.
whereas this guy is...
his name is Troy Webster.
never met a dollar he couldn't launder.
a certified CPA with offices in the Isle of Man, Dubai and the Caymans.
his number one client...
the frog.
your favorite international arms dealer and mine.
wasn't webster's favorite. At least not anymore.
they had a falling out?
webster woke up one day, and realized he had sold his soul to the devil.
too bad the devil doesn't give refunds.
webster knew the risks. -What was the reward?
he was bringing me a file on La Grenouille's entire operation down to the last dock invoice, past and future.
next arms shipment he made, we could have nailed him.
france would have had no choice but to extradite him to the U. S.
and he'd never know how we got to him.
the only thing we found on webster was his cell. No file.
the cell's flash drive was empty, but that doesn't mean there couldn't be a hidden directory.
McGee, get the drive down to Abby... - Down to Abby and see if she can pull anything off of it.
DiNozzo, Ziva, follow up every lead... - Follow up every lead you have on the shooter, and report directly to me.
I sure would like to be a fly on the wall up there.
never mind.
I suppose I should say thank you. -For...
for not calling me out when you had a right to.
I apologize. It's your team. I was out of order.
whose team?
your team.
want me to get the shades?
I'm through sitting in the dark looking at photos.
Yeah. I noticed.
you think I'm being reckless.
what do you think?
I think I'm taking the same chances that you did when you were after Ari.
I wasn't the Director of NCIS.
but I am.
it gives me prerogatives.
Troy Webster initiated contact with me three months ago.
then he got cold feet. -Until last night.
he called after midnight.
said he had information on an arms shipment to an American supplier happening soon.
it was an opportuny I could not not pass up.
which Webster would have known.
it wasn't a trap. -You sure?
you're still assuming webster was the target.
he could have been the bait.
do you get it now?
the real question is, why didn't you get it sooner?
you think my personal feelings about La Grenouille are clouding my judgment?
you don't know what my personal feelings are.
right.
I have no need to know.
how far are you willing to go to get this guy, Jen?
as far as you went to get Ari, Jethro.
it was 1917 before Mata Hari was finally arrested although the French had no concrete proof that she was spying for the Germans.
Yeah, but who needs proof when accusation will suffice?
strange to say, it was the Germans who deliberately leaked that she was working for them, thus reinforcing the spy world's oldest maxim...
don't be a spy? -Trust no one.
you would have made a lousy agent provocateur, Jethro.
well, thank you, Duck. I'll take that as a compliment.
I'm just taking my own advice,
trying to confirm Abby's fingerprint I. D. somehow.
you got a reason to think they won't match?
well, you never know in this game.
duck, I also don't know what I'm doing here.
Oh, yes. Well, I...
I do have some information that you may find useful as well as inexplicable.
take a look at this.
one bullet perfectly bisected the inferior vena cava.
another, the superior vena cava.
also a perfect bisection.
two in the chest.
and one in the head.
almost dead center.
standard execution-style, but with astounding accuracy.
Troy Webster was the target.
if the shooter had wanted the director dead, he would not have missed.
as for Troy Webster, the shooter may have wasted his bullets.
the patient suffered from an elevated protein level in his cerebral spinal fluid.
I didn't think much of it at the time until I opened up his cranium.
and I found this.
it's almost certainly malignant.
brain tumor. -And inoperable.
he would have been dead in six weeks.
that might explain why he had a change of heart.
if he knew about it.
I also took the precaution of acquiring his medical records.
given the size of this tumor
you'd think he would have known something was amiss.
would have said something to his doctor but there's no mention of any abnormality, far less cancer.
any chance they could have missed it? -No.
I am at a loss to explain it.
hence the word inexplicable.
Hello, hello. What is this?
the backup generators kicking in.
sorry! That was me.
I think it's out.
have you ever seen anything like this?
what's going on?
you two okay? -Well, we're fine.
Bertha...she's toast.
what happened?
well, we were trying to access Webster's smartphone.
turned out there was some sort of hidden partition.
we must have triggered some sort of fail-safe.
which uploaded a virus on Abby's system.
a virus did this? -No.
but it tricked our surge protector into thinking that there was a lightning strike that killed the power.
when the backups kicked in, it overloaded our distribution node.
were you able to pull anything off the phone before it self-destructed?
no. Surge took care of that.
pretty mission impossible, huh?
can you retrieve any data?
there's no data left to retrieve.
anything that Webster would have had on La Grenouille, it's gone.
Aw, somebody...
this was careless! -Jen.
how many more lives are going to be ruined before we bring that monster in?
how many have been ruined so far?
it's not over. We still have Troy Webster.
not sure how much talking he's going to do.
he doesn't need to.
webster was going to bring us La Grenouille for arms dealing.
now he's going to bring him to us for murder.
does this ever happened before? -No.
What'd you say to them?
I told them to send someone over.
you want to see the CIA, you always do it on their turf and their terms.
maybe they've finally figured out that that we're all on the same team.
it doesn't mean they're going to play ball.
after the way we salvaged Ares for them, they owe us.
Yes, Cynthia?
you appointment's arrived, Director.
send them in.
agent Fornell? -Jenny. Jethro.
get lost on your way to work, Tobi?
we were expecting someone from the CIA, not FBI.
as you know, I'm on attachment to homeland security.
that doesn't make you CIA.
and yet here I am, just the same.
Langley hates the FBI.
Yeah, but not so much as they hate you right now.
you really pissed them off over something.
and so you volunteered to smooth things out.
not exacy volunteered.
I just drew the short straw.
so you guys want to tell me what this is all about?
because they didn't tell me squat.
I need face time with one of their undercover assets.
name? -Trent Kort alias.
they're gonna want to know why.
on going NCIS investigation. -That's it?
one of my informants was killed.
I believe kort has information to help me find the killer.
that sounds reasonable.
on the other hand, this is the CIA, so they're probably going to tell me to tell you to go to hell.
remind them they owe us.
and if you want to know why, ask them.
and who said the old days were dead.
not them.
well, I guess hell hasn't frozen over after all.
thank god you're here.
I told you to come alone.
look, I'm through keeping secrets on this one, Abs.
if it's about the case... -We are all ears.
is that like being a fly on the wall?
okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.
per strict instructions from Director Shepard,
I'm going over all the crime scene evidence with a fine-tooth comb.
anything good?
tire marks confirm the make and model of the drive-by vehicle.
which we already know from the Director.
I'm just getting warmed up here.
the striations on the slugs from the Director's car match the slugs from Troy Webster.
I didn't find any of the director's slugs.
that's cause she didn't miss.
I did find something interesting on the window she shattered.
blood.
even though blood spatter can travel for several meters, the SUV was too far away for this to be Troy Webster's.
she hit one of La Grenouille's men.
through a tinted window. -In a car going 40 miles an hour.
rock on, Jenny. -But was it the shooter or the driver?
enough to pull DNA? -I'm running it now.
let us know.
actually...it's what found inside the Director's car that I'm not really sure what to do with.
What'd you find?
they were in her glove compartment.
what was that doing in her glove compartment?
I don't know.
but I'm sure the director doesn't want her, um...
personal business on an inventory log for the entire federal government to read.
not this business.
and I can't take it off the log. That would be a crime.
maybe you should ask the director what to do.
I am not having that conversation.
but you could.
me?
Yes, you are the senior field agent.
and you never hesitate to remind us.
as your senior field agent, I say we draw straws.
here hold that... thought for a second.
Hey, what are you wearing? -Scrubs.
scrubs can be sexy.
you've got sex on the brain, you know that?
well, why fight a billion years of evolutionary drive?
I don't know, you're the one who made me wait, remember?
well, the good news is, those dark days are long behind us.
I've got some good news myself. My mother is in town.
and she wants to meet you.
apparently you and I have very different definitions of the word "good."
I would think you'd be the kind of guy that's had a lot of practice meeting parents.
actually, no. -Right.
never made it that far.
well, there's a first time for everything.
Hey, hey, you...hey!
what was that?
uh, kind of hard to explain.
explain it to my mother and me over dinner.
Oh, Jeanne, I'm sorry I'm, I'm, uh...
I'm going to have to work late tonight.
what kind of a lame excuse is that?
well, it is lame, but it's not an excuse.
I'll see what I can do.
I promise I'll make it worth your while.
bribery will get you everywhere.
Bye. -Bye.
director.
schedule a briefing in an hour and get me Agent Dinozzo.
Yes, ma'am.
you got him.
I know Gibbs teaches you to anticipate.
but I didn't even know I needed you until a second ago.
when you're good, you're good.
what's on your mind?
you first.
the GPS marker you tagged with Regine Smidt's luggage with has gone dark.
maybe it's out of batteries.
well, that means she found it. How?
little bugger's supposed to be undetectable.
I'm more concerned with when.
she told La Genouille.
and if she managed to ascertain the time her luggage was tagged...
he might be able to figure out who tagged it.
just when I thought my day couldn't get any worse.
forward that file to my office, please.
he's been assigned as our liaison with CIA.
they chose him because they thought it'd make you easier to handle?
actually, he said the agents drew straws for the duty.
apparently, my reputation precedes me.
it's hard to imagine grown adults drawing straws just to deal with little old me.
what was it you wanted to ask me again?
come to mama.
beautiful.
Hi. -Hi.
it's kind of a tradition when I get new equipment.
so I guess you're here for the results of the blood I found?
I heard you got a hit on the DNA.
Yes, and no.
let's start with the yes part, Abs.
Gibbs, I down here by myself all day long, and I finally have some company.
so, don't make me rush this.
I isolated the DNA from the blood on the SUV's glass fragments.
the blood spatter indicated that it came from the driver.
so I ran the dna through every database I could think of, and I got nothing.
so, ask me why I'm smilg.
you're always smiling, Abby.
well, that's 'cause I'm a happy person, Gibbs.
and I was especially happy when I found out that our driver was a mutant.
I mean, we all have mutations in our DNA technically...
the owner had a genetic defect at position 370 on his glucosidase beta acid gene.
it's called Gaucher's Disease.
rare? -It's rare enough.
it's treated with an enzyme-replacement drug called Ceredase.
there's only three pharmacies within a hundred-mile radius that carry it and there's only one patient taking it.
you got an address?
do you even have to ask?
thank you.
nice place. -Apartment 212.
warrant. -Right here.
federal agents!
boss, Agent Lee wanted me to remind you we need to wait at least 15 seconds...
clear!
well, this guy was either practicing for his plastic surgery finals...
or he was injured in a drive-by.
not injured.
dead.
come in.
I was just reading your autopsy report.
lucky we don't need to worry about finding this one's killer since it was me.
your bullet tore through his brachial and carotid arteries and lodged against his clavicle.
someone tried to stitch up his wounds, but without proper medical knowledge.
I had La Grenouille by the throat.
then he had my informant killed. Fine.
I'll make a murder case.
and then I kill the star witness who could tie the murder back to La Grenouille.
perfect.
w-well, there's always the shooter.
if we can find him.
though I doubt he would be able to give you what you want.
is there something I can do for you, Dr. Mallard?
Yeah, I came to discuss my preliminary findings.
isn't that what I just read? -No, no, no.
not that my psychological profile of La Grenouille.
it's not complete, but under the circumstances, I thought it prudent to avail you of what I've gathered so far.
avail me.
well, La Grenouille is not your ordinary arms dealer.
he's educated, refined, has a keen appreciation of opera - Mm.
and let's not forget cognac. -Oh, I haven't.
I will forever remember his gift to me.
do you know that it was a unique and rare bottle of Napoleon br...
Ducky, your point?
he's not the type to settle disputes with violence.
he's an arms dealer.
who fancies himself a businessn.
now, he may be a merchant of death, but he's...
he's no more likely to solve a problem with violence than your typical tobacco company CEO.
and we both know how many people those products kill.
so La Grenouille was going to let Troy Webster turn state's evidence against him?
I'm not suggesting he wouldn't have dealt with those problems but a man whose favorite opera is La Forza del Destino is sophisticated.
and he's far more likely to use that sophistication as his weapon.
violent murder just... is not his style.
you liked him, didn't you?
excuse me?
you found him charming?
well, I-I don't see how that's relevant.
well, I admit, for a mass murderer, he may have a certain gracious charm.
perhaps it's clouding your judgment.
perhaps it's not my judgme that's being clouded.
you don't know him like I do.
and exactly how is that, Director.
good night, doctor.
the dead driver appears to be a dead end.
which makes the shooter our last link La Grenouille.
better hope he's not dead, too.
I'll start running down his known associates.
Jethro. -Hey, duck.
you and the director have a nice chat?
well, I wouldn't call it nice.
illuminating, perhaps.
for who? -Well, not for her.
as you expected, she didn't appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.
she still thinks of him as prime suspect.
so do I.
Yes, but you listen to my perspective and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the fact were to change.
and the director's won't?
it does not seem likely. -But why?
well, you don't need a degree in psychology to see that there's a history between those two.
something that is consuming her.
her every...action, every thought.
how far? -Will she go?
well, as far as any obsessed person.
as far as it takes.
Jeanne, what is taking you so long? Your mother could be here any second.
relax, Tony. I'm 20 feet away.
Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do if she comes in here while you're gone, huh?
uh, say hello and introduce yourself.
just like that? -Just like that.
what woman can resist your usual charming self?
Thanks.
hello. Hi. Hello. Hello.
Hello, hello.
show time.
Hello, uh, Dr. Berkley. I'm, I'm Tony.
I know who you are.
my daughter told me you'd be the one in the overpriced shoes.
zegna Oxfords? -Good eyes.
uh, what else did she tell you about me? -Everything.
I'm not quite sure what worries me the most.
Hi, baby. -Hi, mom.
I see you two have met.
thank you.
thank you.
you got to be kidding.
old habit.
so, you're the overzealous fed who nearly mucked up 18 months of undercover work.
I prefer to think of it as doing my job. -Gibbs.
I'm not my director's keeper.
I don't have a lot of time.
Grenouille thinks I'm in DC getting dirt on a troublesome customs inspector.
well?
your boss killed my informant two days ago.
informant got a name? -Troy Webster.
I need your help to take La Grenouille down for it.
you sure it was my boss?
you have any information to the contrary?
no, but I've been working with grenouille a long time.
I've never known him to order a hit.
and if he did, you'd know?
not necessarily.
Grenouille keeps information as compartmentalized as possible, where everything is...
need to know. -Yeah.
and accounting is not my department.
still, I doubt grenouille had anything to do with the murder.
it's just not his style.
this isn't a fashion contest.
I'm not asking for your opinion.
I'm asking who La Grenouille would have gotten for the hit.
he's Grenouille's American small arms distributor.
the kind of guy that's not afraid to get his hands dirty.
if Grenouille were to contract a kill in the states,
jones would be the only man he'd trust.
so, I told the rep from the HMO that if he didn't authorize the transplant that I'd give his number to the family, and he could take it up with them.
my mother is used to getting what she wants.
I don't doubt that for a second.
well, I didn't become a doctor to do paperwork. I became a doctor to be a doctor.
as it is, the delay caused a rupture in the bile duct.
which increases post-op susceptibility to intestinal parasites.
very good, honey.
speaking of intestinal parasites, how's your father?
mom, be good.
I think I earned that segue.
I saw him last month, he's fine.
good for him. So...
how long have you been sleeping with my daughter?
mother.
we're all adults here.
two of us are even doctors.
well, we've been sleeping together for a few months and, uh, before you ask, yes, we are using protection.
mm, how'd u know I was gonna ask that?
because...
you said that Jeanne told you everything aboout me.
and so...you know that I'm, uh...
a player?
actually, I was gonna say "new at commitment.
but as her mother, naturally you're concerned that your daughter's being taken advantage of.
Oh, I know you're not taking advantage of her.
and how do you know that?
the way you look at her.
love doesn't show up on an X-ray, but I do recognize it when I see it.
and still you worry about me.
Oh, a leopard doesn't change its spots overnight, and I can see the doubt in your eyes.
even you're wondering how long this is gonna last.
okay, I think it's time for another segue.
I made the same mistake with Jeanne's father.
Momma...Tony is not dad.
and I don't want to see her hurt the way that I was.
okay?
could've used one of these last night.
dinner went well?
barely got out of there alive.
hopefully, we all do.
this Jones guy's got a pretty serious record.
besides being Grenouil's American distributor we've got suspected murder, aggravated assault...
don't forget assault with a deadly weapon, arson and kidnapping.
he's not going down without a fight.
he did not look so tough to me.
suspect is on-site, alone.
armed? -There was. I took care of it.
you two take the back. McGee, you're with me.
just make sure Jones can still talk after he's taken care of.
to get extradition we need an actual confession that La Grenouille ordered the hit.
copy that.
not so tough.
the bigger they are, the louder they fall, McGee.
the harder, Ziva.
get ready to move.
move. Now.
freeze. Federal agents.
la Grenouille told you where to find me?
I said freeze.
you try to do a guy a favor and this is how he repays you.
get down on the ground.
stop! -Hold your fire.
hold it!
don't do it! -I need him alive.
tango Eight, sitrep!
I repeat, I need your sitrep, Tango Eight.
we're fine, Director.
uh, suspect isn't.
Staring's not gonna change anything.
trust me.
as far as I'm concerned, Andre Jones got exactly what he deserved.
this isn't about Jones.
you're fishing. That's not like you, Jethro.
you and me are gonna have a little talk.
doesn't make sense.
why does Jones think that La Grenouille sold him out?
jones was the last link to the frog.
with him out of the way, we'd never make a murder charge against La Grenouille stick.
he tricked us into doing his dirty work.
Ducky says he uses his sophiscation as a weapon.
even I was unaware of just how sharp that weapon is.
I just got off the phone with Troy Webster's physician.
did you let him know he missed Webster's cancer?
I did. And I got two distinct impressions.
one, he was scared. And two, he was well aware of that tumor.
I mean, how could he have missed it?
Yeah, the good doctor was bribed to keep it a secret. Or threatened.
la Grenouille worried his employee health premiums were going to go up?
being diagnosed with a terminal illness, Tony, tends to make one eager to atone for one's sins.
and Grenouille didn't want Webster atoning for his.
webster still tried, so he must've known he was dying.
with that tumor I found?
no, the neurological deficits would have been pronounced.
he must have suspected the end was near regardless of what any doctor told him.
normally, when someone says that they need to have a little talk, they actually talk.
Director...of NCIS.
Yes.
that's a job I wouldn't want.
don't worry, no one's offering. -You know why?
you mean besides your impatience, total lack of respect for authority and the fact that you still haven't learned to play nice with others?
Yeah. Yeah, besides all that?
I already told you, I am not allowing my personal feelings to interfere with my job.
tell me again.
is there something wrong with wanting to put an arms dealer out of business?
no.
is that what you're really after?
what else would I be after?
I don't know, but at the rate you're going the name "Director" is not gonna be on that door much longer.
it's good to know you're watching my back, Jethro.
Yeah. Gibbs.
be right down.
well, you just may get a chance to put that arms dealer out of business yet.
you can run, La Grenouille...
but you can't hide.
or maybe you can. -What do you got, Abs?
Oh, your usual incriminating evidence, all circumstantial but beggars can't be choosers.
I'll take what I can get at this point.
McGee asked me to parse Andre Jones's old phone and bank records, and when I did, I saw a pattern.
an encrypted satellite phone call comes in and then a large payment to an offshore account goes out.
jones is paying for a shipment.
and then, like swiss clockwork, 48 hours later, his GPS signal goes off the grid.
picking up the shipment. -He doesn't want to be followed.
I haven't been able to trace the satellite call yet but I did recognize the encryption algorithm.
the frog.
it's the same as the one La Grenouille's people used to call Charles Harrow.
that's a good job, Abby. -Have a grand finale.
jones made his last phone call exactly one day ago.
which means a shipment is coming in less than 24 hours.
ten bucks says that that is what Troy Webster was planning on telling us this entire time.
an arms shipment.
what happened to your murder case?
our key witness didn't survive his deposition.
wouldn't have done you any good if he did.
after our conversation,
I made some interdepartmental inquiries.
Grenouille was not happy to hear about Webster's murder.
you're saying he didn't authorize it?
I'm saying, Grenouille specifically spread the word to not touch Webster.
she's pretty fired up.
you know what her beef is? -No.
would you tell me if you did?
jones disobeyed La Grenouille.
didn't care about the orders to leave Webster alone.
he knew Webster could hurt him as bad as he could hurt La Grenouille.
that's why Jones thought La Grenouille had sold him out.
as punishment for killing Webster.
Grenouille must have had his own plans for Webster.
sap's probably better off dead.
one thing grenouille is good at, it's ruining people's lives.
okay, tell me this.
is she hot after all arms dealers or is there something about this one in particular?
you're CIA for now, Tobias. You tell me.
something about this one.
and you don't know what it is either.
as for your arms shipment, as far as I know Grenouille has no upcoming deliveries.
as far as you know.
like I said, not my department.
however, every arms shipment requires an end-use certificate.
it's a guarantee from the buyer that the arms won't be resold illegally.
that's why we've had so much trouble getting to La Grenouille.
his buyers always manage to get one. All it takes is a third-world General on the payroll or an exceptionally good forger.
which one did Andre Jones have?
guy looks like an English teacher.
actually, an art teacher.
you know why you're here. -No.
it wasn't a question.
do you know how long you're going to prison?
that was a question.
get the feeling the guys have done this before?
agent Gibbs.
what's the going rate for forging an EUC certificate for arms smuggling?
20 years.
I'm an art teacher. -Good.
then you can draw us a picture...
walked right into that one.
of the EUC document you forged for Andre Jones's guns.
and please make sure that I can read the time and location of shipment.
it's going down either way.
if you help us, I can put in a good word with the judge.
and if you dont, then...
I hear Gitmo is lovely this time of year.
definitely done this before.
though you will be wearing a hood.
and that's certainly going to kill your view.
what kind of good word could you put in with the judge?
well, it depends how good your drawing is.
Yeah, okay.
I-I forged the EUC for Jones, but I don't have a location or a date.
no, not good enough. -No, he make me leave it blank.
I swear.
it's added by his shell company. -Name?
abbot Imports. -Yeah, got an address?
still working on it. -What's the problem?
problem is, it doesn't exist. There's no federal tax I. D.
mail goes to a P. O. box.
who owns the box?
bills are paid by an Andre Jones.
I'm really starting to wish we didn't kill him.
McGee, did you try customs? -Trying now.
there has to be some record of his imports, even if it is through a shell company.
Ooh, there is.
next shipment is scheduled to arrive today.
Norfk Port Authority. -Got the container number.
ever seen anyone walk that quickly in heels?
only at the end of a really hairy date.
import company missed the pickup.
no one claims the container within the next 12 hours, orders are "return it to sender."
lucky you guys called when you did.
luck had very little to do with it.
I really hope the Director relaxes a bit after this.
don't get your hopes up, McGee. -Why?
once we get the weapons and trace them back to La Grenouille, he'll go underground.
Interpol will issue a red notice.
but it'll still be up to us to find him.
so, in other words... -There.
cancel your dinner plans, probie.
open it. -Yes, ma'am.
I got you.
squirt guns.
dear Webster, best wishes on your new career.
we have nothing.
we never did.
he's good. -He's real good.
he'd better be.
these marines sure take this stuff seriously.
might as well get comfortable this could take some time.
check the I.D., check the trunk.
no dogs. Hate dogs. Dogs are a pain in the ass.
never met a dog that didn't want to try to bite me.
looking for bombs or bin laden, I guess.
clear. - Finally.
proceed.
good morning, sir.
photo I.D. and pop the trunk, please. - Sure thing.
drop off? - Guy says he wants to see someone at NCIS.
clear.
lower the window, please, sir.
Hey, buddy, lady needs to see some I.D..
photo I.D., please, sir.
sir? Step out of the vehicle, please.
these files have to be reviewed by friday.
I'll get to them. - Tomorrow's friday.
had a wife like you once, Cynthia.
I divorced her. - Beat her to it, did you?
you didn't read it. - Scolti case. I know the case agent.
je Gillman. He's a good man.
the director doesn't want justice not going to trial because of a procedural error.
well, then the director should be here instead of shopping in paris all week.
Annterpol antiterrorist conference isn't shopping. - Yeah.
know him, too? - Yep.
don't worry. Justice has its own procedural problems.
who's special agent Grisham? - Transferred in from San Diego.
Hollywood special agent. Rejected.
you have to give a reason.
it's her private line.
Hello, Cynthia.
Hello?
Cynthi - No...
I should have recognized the heavy breathing.
is the agency intact?
I cut it up into small bitsy pieces and sold it to the three-letter boys.
I take it walking in my heels has presented a challenge.
well, I accepted some speaking requests for you.
ich speaking requests? - Women for women, st. Paul, minnesota chapter.
the eighth grade class of hondo middle school in Hondo, Texas.
the teacher, she's an admirer.
society of preservation for barbershopuartets.
you're not serious, Jethro.
well, about the barbershop quartets, no, no, I'm not.
but I did accept six, seven... Eight, nine others for you.
put Cynthia on. - Hey, how's the frog...
legs? You always enjoyed them sauteed in butter.
Cynthia. Now!
Yes, director.
tell me you didn't send out acceptances for speaking engagements.
of course not, director. - Thank you, Cynthia.
you have just earned yourself a herm scarf. - Thank you, director.
put him back on.
yes... - Is there any serious business I should know about?
well, the...
buy america toilet paper doesn't fit the metric fixtures, and we got a truck...
she hung up on me. - Shocking.
you call back to apologize uh, I don't know what you heard, boss, but I was not the one who started that pool.
what pool is that, Dinozzo?
on the case. - What case?
there's a dead body in the taxi at the main gate case.
I'll be right there.
the case files? - Leave them on my desk.
they are on your desk.
it's not often we get to walk to a crime scene, if this is a crime scene.
there's no blood, no bullet holes, no knife punctures, no obvious signs of bruising, no ligure marks, no petechial hemorrhaging on the eye or eyelid.
natural causes?
there's nothing natural about a man of his age keeling over in a taxicab.
maybe he died of embarrassment when he couldn't pay the cab fare.
alas, death by embarrassment is not a certifiable cause, however intriguing the notion.
excuse me, Dky.
it's about time that boy fell in love.
Hey. - I found a house.
house? Thought we were renting an apartment.
no, we're buying a house. - Buying?
it's the most adorable little bungalow, Tony.
only Hollywood has bungalows, Jeae.
you don't want to buy a house with me?
I love playing house with you. - Not the same thing.
can I call you back tonight?
my boss is on his way over and he doesn't look very happy.
I thought you ran things over there. - I do. Just not all the time.
um, we'll play house tonight.
Hey, I win the pool!
wait a minute. How do you figure that?
I predicted that Gibbs would last four days as director before reverting to working a case.
it is thursday. Four days!
he's not working the case. He's just...Curious.
every time he's been at the crime scene, he's been there to investigate.
how is today different?
he is in the ny yard because that's where the director's office is located.
let's ask him.
so you would have Gibbs give up his post as acting director just to win a $50 pool?
Yes.
hmm, guess it's true what they say about the scotsmen.
I trust that if Gibbs is more than just curious, you will inform me?
Scout's nor.
you said you were never in the boy scouts.
I was an alpha chi delta wet t-shirt spring-break talent scout.
does that count?
give me some love.
you gave that man too much to swallow in one bite, Dr. Benoit.
it's a house, Carly, not a steak.
from rental apartment to buying a house in one phone call, are you crazy?
you got to take these things slow.
toss a few home magazines around.
well, he does crossword puzzles in there.
okay, talk to him about it when he's vulnerable.
hmm, Tony's never vulnerable.
not even when you put on your best bedside manner?
driver's name is Joe Kelly.
he says the victim hailed him on 25th street and told him to bring him here.
to see? - Us. He did not specify a particular agent.
Mr. Kelly, did you ever see your fare before? - Never.
