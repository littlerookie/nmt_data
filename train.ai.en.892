drop the good-soldier crap.
you're a turncoat now, wanted by your own country.
so just... forget about the girl.
I wish I could.
wish harder.
I don't get it, Cole. Success has made you...
what?
crazy, cocky... or just sloppy?
you didn't have to kill the hit man.
I assigned him a task, and he failed.
you're not getting Barrett.
Gibbs has her and DiNozzo in a safe house.
place called Old Rag Mountain.
you sure?
per SECNAV.
even for a politician, he talks too much.
I'm giving you this heads-up out of loyalty.
and in return, you want me to leave so you're not implicated.
I want you to leave so neither of us ends up in Leavenworth.
again, sir...
I wish I could.
but no loose ends.
I got to finish what we started.
come on, boy. Come on, let's go. Easy.
same technique as used on Dane before his fall from the window.
same knife?
it would appear so.
it was plunged in here, and then twisted around.
perforated both lungs.
this caused massive internal bleeding.
no way Latham here was gonna draw a breath, much less call for help.
Latham let him get close. He trusted him.
well, trust was his first mistake.
that a microchip?
Oh, yeah, but no longer active, so you can add it to the collection.
it's interesting.
well, locating Stratton, or Cole, as you now call him-- easier said than done.
guy's a phantom.
go catch a ghost.
all I wanted for breakfast was the coffee.
now we're ready for a fair fight.
always good to be prepared.
I've been prepared for months.
with Cole on the loose, I think it's time to bring out some Connery, and I'm paraphrasing.
you never bring a knife to a gunfight. Huh?
James Bond?
untouchables, 1987.
connery won an Academy Award for that.
I liked him in, uh, Xanadu.
you know, one of these days, I'd like to actually meet someone who appreciates movies the way I do.
or at least appreciates the way I appreciate them.
she does, Tony.
who?
agent Ziva David believes that the Pirates of the Caribbean is a cinema classic.
I'm not talking about movies, Tony, I'm talking about you.
she cares.
what's the matter with you? We're-We're coworkers.
Yeah.
we're teammates.
we have each other's backs.
exactly.
surround yourself with people you would give your own life for.
boss... - Shot fired.
Ziva, McGee, move in.
I have visual!
got the shot, take it!
what's he got, a cannon?
sounds like a . 50-caliber round.
a gun that size has limited accuracy.
he seems pretty damn accurate to me.
all right, suppressive fire.
keep him moving in the same direction.
go for it.
I'm sorry for your loss, Gibbs.
it's wrong place, wrong time.
Yeah, you got that right.
we're ready, Boss.
game on?
game over.
how are you, DiNozzo?
I'm good.
so Latham took SECNAV's bait?
Yeah.
Yeah, gave up Old Rag Mountain.
that's 20 miles east.
Jarvis must be one hell of a liar.
well, I'm glad he's lying for us.
time to move?
no. Time to stop running.
Ziva and I are going out for a drink later, if you care to join us.
I would, but, uh, I got a stop to make before I head home.
home, huh?
finally got to call my mom.
home's waiting for me.
need a ride?
SECNAV set me up.
car service.
fancy.
so, come on, you can say it.
I'll miss you most of all, Scarecrow.
wizard of Oz.
look at you.
how far you've come.
I'm so proud of you.
we've been down this Yellow Brick Road before, Tony.
thanks again.
take care of yourself.
always do.
don't disappear.
irons really necessary?
I thought you'd be flattered.
phantom program did a lot of good in the world, Gibbs.
I did a lot of good in service to my country.
did.
you and Latham forgot that.
some very bad people.
doing very bad things, until you came along.
it's worth taking into consideration, no?
should count for something.
it should. It doesn't. not anymore
I don't know where you went off the rails, Stratton, but it brought you here.
you're no better than them now.
deep down, Gibbs- and-and maybe not that deep-- you're no different than me.
I don't kill innocent people for money.
no?
so why do you kill innocent people?
south of the border.
down Mexico way.
that's where I fell in love.
where the stars above came out to play.
so,
EJ is, uh... gone, huh?
and safe, for a change.
may I ask where?
someplace quiet.
with someone she can count on.
hopefully.
that is the word, is it not?
hopefully. Even when you think you can count on someone, you often cannot.
do I detect a blip on the Ray-dar?
I would rather not discuss it.
well, at least EJ and I parted... friends.
agent Cruz seems to have, uh, some communication issues.
Yeah, and I'm losing my patience.
as you well should.
you know...
you and I, we have a lot in common, in that respect.
you think?
I don't think.
I know.
well, then I am, uh, grateful to have someone in my life who is just as romantically dysfunctional as I am.
agent David, do you really consider me to be...
in your life?
no. - Yes.
Seriously?
I mean, what should I say?
say "hello."
okay.
excuse me.
Hello?
um, no, I can talk, yeah.
you cut the alarm?
I cut the phone lines. Detectors won't signal the cops. It's cool.
you heard that?
somebody's up there.
Hey, you're cool, right?
no problem.
Hey, what the hell did you do, man?
that guy came out of nowhere!
come on, man, we got to go.
come on, man, move!
we got to go! - Oh, my God.
morning. - Good morning, Tony.
why are you so preppy?
well, probably because I went to boarding school.
but I think you mean "peppy."
and that's because it's... L. E.S. day!
les?
l. E.S Leave and Earnings Statements.
Oh, you mean payday.
that's another way of putting it.
wait a second.
this isn't right. This isn't my L. E.S. It's McMoneybag's.
somehow he makes more money than me?
maybe they pay people what they're actually worth.
morning, Ziva, Tony.
how much do you make, Tim?
what are you doing with my L. E.S?
it was on my desk.
it's addressed to me - it's a Federal offense.
well, you know what I find offensive and more than a little strange, is that somehow you make $253 week more than me.
it's all about withholding.
Yeah.
what exactly are you withholding?
Yeah, you're withholding something, all right.
you're too smart to hack into the system and try and give yourself a little weekly bump, aren't you?
or should I call Fred Seymour in Accounting and find out?
hang up, DiNozzo.
time's money.
we've got a dead Navy reservist in Arlington.
boss, did you know that McGee makes more money than Ziva and me?
keep me out of this.
I know. he gives a lot to charity, and you should, too.
the DiNozzos are great humanitarians.
you know that.
we got a dead hu-man. Let's go.
was that a pun?
Hey, why are we being arrested?
breaking and entering.
but we didn't steal anything.
you shot the victim twice.
one missed, and the other just...
grazed him.
besides, he was already dead.
you sure about that?
he off'd himself, man. Come on.
we just happened to be here, man.
wrong place, wrong time.
look, we could've taken some of this stuff on our way out, but we didn't, man.
was there anybody else in the house?
I don't think so.
get 'em out.
man!
next time, I'm picking the place we hit.
interesting.
doc.
Hangingr the gunsho The math.
for centuries, hangings used a standard dead drop, but then in 1872, an Englishman named William Marwood calculated a formula using a man's height, weight and the distance dropped to ensure a cleanly snapped neck.
so who is our well-versed victim?
Dr. Robert Banks, psychologist and Navy reservist on active duty.
high-level security clearance at the Pentagon.
Dr. Banks here clearly used Marwood's formula and a double knot, thus ensuring the hangman's fracture.
Yeah, hoping for instantaneous death.
his goal was to fracture the third and fourth vertebrae.
judging by the angle of the neck and the petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes, his efforts were successful.
but who shot him?
robbers.
well, then we'll have to see which killed him first, the bullet or the rope.
boss, local LEOs say there's a woman outside claims to be the victim's doctor.
let her in.
Dr. Kate's sister.
are you his doc, Doc?
Yeah, and his friend.
my condolences, Dr. Cranston.
Gibbs, found Banks's cell phone - you're not gonna believe who called him four times last night.
Dr. Cranston.
he... hanged himself, huh?
looks that way.
well, whatever it looks like, Gibbs, you look deeper.
robert was one of the strongest people I knew.
he wouldn't do this, couldn't.
I know someone killed him.
so, you spoke to him last night, Doc?
several times.
about what?
I'm afraid the rules of confidentiality prevent me from giving you any details.
doc, guy's dead.
robert was a brilliant psychologist.
we went to school together.
what about since then?
we were close colleagues.
his wife filed for divorce a few months ago.
he was having a difficult time prior to that as well.
at work? He have enemies?
he was consulting on a special project for the Pentagon.
what kind of project?
the kind that gets you killed, apparently.
M. I.S. O. - Military Information Support Operations.
I'm old-school, Doc.
Psy-ops'll do.
Yeah, well, then you know ey use mind games to confuse and manipulate the enemy.
I know that.
credit card statements over the past few months show that he was writing prescriptions for himself.
Oh, not true.
that's the kind of background fabrication psy-ops excels at.
Really? And you know this because...?
because Banks invented it.
that what you and Banks talked about?
we talked about his divorce.
he wanted me to start seeing his daughter to help her get through it.
turns out he was having just as much trouble as she was.
he was getting increasingly anxious, but whenever I brought up his daughter, his panic would subside.
he lived for his little girl.
she was his hope, his whole reason for living.
people who have any hope at all, Gibbs, they don't take their own life, they embrace it.
banks didn't kill himself.
forgive me if I'm having a little trouble with this.
Bobby had been so unpredictable lately.
he just...
he just wanted Amber to be happy.
it's all because they broke up.
he still loved her.
you made this happen.
tell me about your relationship, Mrs. Banks.
why does any couple split after so many years?
we grew apart.
he'd become...
different.
he had become moody.
he wasn't the man that I married.
and... he started to take it out on both of us.
mom...
you know he wasn't the same, Amber.
life insurance has you as the sole beneficiary.
Yeah. His, um, university and naval death benefits.
he had an additional policy, too.
$4 million for both of you.
but...
wouldn't the suicide change that?
no, no, not in this case, he had a policy that had an exclusion clause.
you sure you didn't know about the money?
Hey, finally.
you work with Fred Seymour in Accounting, right?
uh, you need an accountant?
you bet I do.
I got a salary dispute.
are you feeling overvalued or undervalued?
that's an interesting question.
it's not me, actually, it's McGee.
W's McGee?
my coworker.
the tall, pasty guy who wanders around sort of...
you know, he spends way too much time indoors. Needs light.
shouldn't I be talking to him?
technically.
that's a good point.
there's probably some underlying feelings of inadequacy between the tw of you, right?
no. What do you mean, inadequacy?
did your father ever tell you he loved you?
you're not from Accounting, are you?
why did you pretend to be?
I didn't.
you did. You just saw what you wanted to see.
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.
are we breaking up already?
who are you?
I'm Dr. Samantha Ryan, DOD, Psy-ops Division.
I've been told to come and see a Special Agent Gibbs.
Yeah, you found him.
you a brain gamer, right?
that's head brain gamer to you.
I oversee all military information support operations.
I understand you're investigating the death of Dr. Robert Banks.
agent Gibbs, word in my office.
Hi, Leon.
Dr. Ryan, what a surprise.
you know Director Vance.
you seem to know everybody.
Yeah, it's my job.
Oh, Gibbs, feel free to ask Leon anything you want.
we go way back.
DiNozzo, escort Dr. Ryan to the conference room.
Dr. Cranston's waiting.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Director, you look good.
authority...
suits you.
I got a call from SECNAV.
Oh, great. - No, it wasn't.
somebody steal his golf bag?
secdef wants to know what NCIS is doing investigating an M. I.S. O. employee.
investigating a possible murder.
I know you're not big on fine lines, Gibbs, but I am.
this happens to be one of them.
dead guy's Navy, Leon.
that makes it ours.
so, how do you know Dr. Ryan?
long story.
love to hear it.
she's an old colleague. Let's just say we spent some time together at the war college - Ah, private time? - Classified time.
okay, okay, enough said.
be careful, she's inquisitive.
Yeah, well, so am I.
not like her.
do you exercise?
I walk. - Why?
because you look skinny.
skinnier than the last time I saw you.
gave up dairy.
I'm lactose-intolerant.
you always were into the latest fads.
well, it's not really a fad; it's a diagnosis.
so, anybody want coffee?
no milk - No milk
you two went to school together, right?
hmm, yes. Does that turn you on, Agent Gibbs?
a couple of coeds?
afterwards, she went clinical, and I went military.
very different points of view.
Oh, and, um, full disclosure: we both slept with Banks.
she was interested in his mind.
I... - She's doing it.
you're doing it.
I'm doing what?
Oh, the games. Thnonsense.
and I'm leaving.
no, no, you're not.
Sam, we think Dr. Banks was the victim of psy-ops scheme.
we?
he was my patient.
that's ridiculous. Is it?
agent Gibbs, I will answer any queson that you have, but not here and obviously not with her.
why not?
national security.
next meeting, my office, my rules. - My investigation.
my friend. - Our friend, Rachel.
banks was working with an M. I.S. O. field op named Mitchell on an assignment.
you probably should talk to him.
Yeah, Doug, I'm on my way.
Hey, Gibbs.
don't trust these people.
especially her.
I don't follow. Which part, Mitchell?
Dr. Banks can't be dead. I just spoke to him yesterday.
he's gone.
no. would've been informed.
DOD.
Pentagon.
there's a chain of communication that would've been engaged.
he's dead.
you are a reservist working for psy-ops, yes?
former Navy.
I'm not cut out for this head game stuff.
I... can't do it anymore.
they're, uh...
they're reassigning me.
you worked with Dr. Banks for how long?
almost a year.
banks is a smart man and a good father.
he was going through a rough divorce, an ugly custody battle.
the doctor have any problems with his coworkers?
threats or disagreements?
look, this is a restricted M. I.S. O. field unit.
all information is case-sensitive and has to be...
we're cleared.
answer the question.
it's a court order.
here.
former Marine Second Lieutenant Kyle Baxter.
received a general discharge six months ago because of a negative emotional stability eval.
who wrote it?
Dr. Banks, of course.
give me a verdict, Duck.
which came first, the chicken or the egg?
well, always been a chicken man myself.
Oh, that's my conundrum.
the heart continues to beat after a hanging for a few moments.
the doctor here was shot and continued to bleed.
now, with the amount of blood loss,
I would hypothesize that the bullet hit him milliseconds after his neck was snapped clean by the rope.
definitely a suicide?
without doubt.
but he was only hastening the inevitable.
what are you saying?
his kidney and liver functions were deteriorating at an alarming rate.
based on what?
Abby is determining that.
suffice to say, had the doctor not taken his own life, I would estimate he had but...
six months to live.
Abby. - Hi, Gibbs.
it's called "scoundrel patter," courtesy of an Old West con man named "Umbrella Jim Miner."
supposed to confuse the suckas.
Gibbs, watch closely - the hand is quicker than the eye.
attention given, I'll show you how Abby hides the peek-a-boo.
I win.
so, I guess you're not a sucker.
or are you?
all of these pills came out of Banks' medicine cabinet.
one is a benign blood pressure medication.
the other two are dangerous psychotropic stimulants at have been wreaking havoc on his liver and his kidney functions.
I can't tell the difference.
somebody switched out his prescriptions, Gibbs.
it's like the oldest con in the book.
poor sucker. - Yeah.
so, Banks thinks that he's just taking his daily meds, when, in reality, he's taking drugs that have been proven to cause depression and increased mental instability.
psy-ops.
mind games.
he's being played, Abbs. Question is, by who?
chair works.
I like standing.
Whatlse do you like, Agent Gibbs? - Answers.
good. We make a great couple.
I like questions.
you want to tell me something about yourself?
no.
your life story makes you uncomfortable?
you know, nonverbal behaviors comprise 85% of all human communication.
and the most hont part of your body, believe itr not: your feet.
and yours, Agent Gibbs, are pointed directly at my door.
okay. I have a question for you.
speaks volumes.
do you like pancakes?
I love pancakes.
Dr. Ryan?
Yes, Special Age Gibbs, Ross Kilmer, my assistant;
Ross's specialty is to charm and disarm.
he has less patience than I do.
if he's country, I'm rock and roll; works out.
marine Lieutenant Kyle Baxter.
we're coming up empty - you got anything?
um...just about his psych eval.
that's it.
personnel list for the op Banks was working on.
you know what I really like, Doc?
paper.
I, I really... love paper.
Where'd you find these?
one was hidden inside Banks' couch.
the other one was in his mattress.
Oh, wow, the milliguass reading's off the charts.
these are electromagnetic field emitters.
hm, someone tried to give our victim a tumor?
Yeah, more like headaches and nightmares.
high levels of EMF pollution can cause interference with REM sleep cycles.
I'll sleep when I'm dead
personnel files from Ryan.
list of possible killers, huh?
but we don't trust it, right?
run them anyway. Anything else from the house?
Yes. Found this from Banks' office safe: operations protocol for a top secret psy-ops mission.
it appears our victim was working on this last.
but the only person that could confirm that'll probably lie to your face.
I'm getting used to that.
McGee, connect the gizmos you found back to psy-ops.
I can track the parts, boss, but whoever built it most likely is gonna cover their...
tracks.
e - mail issues again?
trust issues.
from now on, I want paper from the source.
paper?
you heard the man, McGee.
he said he wants psy-ops personnel files.
a lot of them.
but any one of them could've planned Banks' murder.
this could take days.
weeks.
there's got to be a million personnel files here.
I don't even know where to begin without a search key.
well, I suggest we begin alphabetically.
could I get you a beer, Agent Gibbs?
no, I'm good.
you look nice.
I assume what you need to talk to me about can't wait till morning?
murders are time-sensitive.
general.
Dr. Banks took his own life.
and I'm not sure if this is the time or the place.
would you excuse me for just a moment?
wow, people in this town love to talk shop and eat cocktail weenies.
I, um, I get the impression by your hoodie that you don't really like parties that much.
no, I like parties, when there's something worth celebrating.
everything all right here, Doctor?
can I be of any assistance?
Oh, thank you, Ross.
um, Special Agent Gibbs needs to speak to me privately.
and I know just the place.
I'll, um, I'll just wait right here.
feel safe, Gibbs?
Oh, I guess not everyone in here has a security clearance.
you're enjoying this.
I'll play along.
what do you got?
removal of Threats Using Drugs and Alternative Methods.
it's a hell of a page-turner, Doc. A real how-to.
driving a sane person to suicide using pills and sleep-deprivation.
that sound familiar to you?
be very careful...
with what you're...
suggesting.
this is a page out of your own playbook, Doc.
so I'm gonna ask you again.
what do you know about the death of Robert Banks?
and I'm gonna tell you again.
nothing.
I'm giving you a chance to come clean, Dr. Ryan.
help solve the murder of a close friend.
I already told you the truth.
whose truth?
your sister used to look at me like that.
like what?
eh, the cat who ate the canary.
I didn't exactly tell you everything earlier, Gibbs.
lot of that going around.
during one of my sessions with Banks, he mentioned a sensitive national security issue.
Yep.
you still should've told me.
I know. I want to catch his killer.
that makes two of us.
it's not exactly a skiff, Doc, but it'll do.
there was a project called Operation Alborz.
okay.
details.
no idea.
what was Banks's involvement?
he didn't tell me.
well, what did he tell you?
I got the sense that someone wanted to make sure he couldn't discuss it with anyone, ever.
someone?
boss? - Yeah, McGee. Go.
I've been going through the military personnel files - all dead ends.
Ryan's info didn't help?
I'm shocked.
which brings us back to former Second Lieutenant Kyle Baxter, the guy who was drummed out of the Marines because of Banks.
pick him up.
we still can't find him.
Hello?
is there a problem?
Gibbs, if something's bothering you, I'd really prefer you tell...
is that a b...
good night, Ryan.
sleep tight.
former second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. Superior IQ.
scored off the charts onhe Officer QualifyinExam.
where is he now?
last known address was in Norfolk.
he was hand-picked by the M. I.S. O.
18 months ago for its secret ops unit.
headed by Banks.
Yeah. Until...?
well, Baxter was thrown out for antisocial behavior, violent tendencies.
eventually discharged from the Marines.
fell off the grid a few months after that.
no. - could...
no, McGee, we can't.
Where'd you get that, boss?
from my basement; it's a bug.
find out where it came from, the old-fashioned way.
you're ringing, McCheater.
boss, I only kept it on to monitor Baxter's incoming cell phone calls.
but this call's still live. - Where?
storefront, 600 block of Chapman Avenue; looks like a cafe.
that's five minutes from here. Tony, Ziva, go.
trace the bug.
with or without my...
who wants to know?
four minutes.
nice. You guys are good.
you're not Baxter.
absolutely not.
Ryan and I work together.
Gibbs knows.
Baxter left me his phone, wanted to see if you guys were, uh...
tracking him.
you can have it.
he's got others.
Where's Baxter now?
you got me.
I wish you luck, though.
you think we're just gonna let you walk away?
well, yeah.
why not?
beautiful day.
you guys have a good one.
a resort in Cancun?
Hey, you guys. - Hi, Mrs. Ryan.
how did you know where my son went to school?
his records are all classified.
did you follow me?
are you following me now? Am I under surveillance, Gibbs?
you hacked my records.
this is my personal life!
psy-ops 101.
you approach people at their most vulnerable.
you even the playing field, Doc.
Oh, you don't want to play with me, Gibbs, trust me.
I keep things confidential for a reason.
I take precautions because I have to.
and my son is off limits.
so is my place.
you don't like your own medicine, Doc?
I am not the enemy!
you bugged my home!
tell us about Operation Alborz.
as I...shared with Agent Gibbs - national security.
mountain range in Iran.
some of the highest peaks.
apparently, very beautiful.
people flock from all over... - Less size, Doc, more pop.
after we invaded Iraq in 2003, Iran started pouring billions into their nuclear program.
recruited scientists to produce plutonium for them.
the Alborz mission was to use psy-op techniques...
to destabilize Iranian nuclear scientists.
cripple the enemy without firing a shot.
21st century warfare.
and the Iranians got wind?
possible.
and you think they could've done the same thing to Dr. Banks in retribution.
look, I'll do whatever I can...
to help you find Robert's killer.
I want this over as much as you do.
Gibbs, get over here.
I processed Banks' laptop.
the encryption was, like, super complex.
but you got in.
I did - with a little help.
I just followed the tracks of someone else that hacked his computer, like, way before I did.
someone was wreaking havoc on Banks' life using his own computer.
like, draining his accounts and buying stocks that he never ordered, sending threatening e - mails.
more mind games.
Yeah. Even if he googled something, he would get misinformation.
like bogus sports scores and even fictional news stories.
he wasn't only being drugged, his entire reality was being manipulated.
by who?
from what I can tell, someone in Mexico.
I traced a ghost I. P. address to a room in a resort in Cancun.
the security video is a little blurry, but I got an instant hit with facial recognition.
the same guy Mitchell implicated, and the same guy that Banks gave a bad psych eval to.
Gibbs, this is the guy we're looking for.
boss. Can I?
go, McGee.
embargo's over.
James Drenden? Who is that?
that's the alias Kyle Baxter was using.
got a hit on a passport under Baxter's alias.
says he was on a flight arriving from Mexico City to Dulles two months ago.
two months is a long time.
he could be anywhere by now.
well, according to the IRS, he's currently employed as a bartender in Georgetown.
why would Baxter still be using the same alias?
honestly, Gibbs, had I known you were looking for me, I would have been here days ago.
Yeah. Spare me the psy-ops charm, Baxter.
we can prove you were in Mexico.
okay, so?
so, drugs found in Banks's system were manufactured close to the resort.
you had the expertise.
and you were messing with him.
Yeah, they're good.
you're looking at a psyps packa here, sir.
you can't trust that.
so, they set you up to take the fall?
obviously.
look, Banks discharged me with violent tendencies. Next thing you know, I'm the fall guy.
and you took the bait, hook, line and sinker.
now, why wouldn't they frame me? It's perfect.
prove that you're telling the truth.
may I?
I never left my phone or that matchbook.
call this number.
ask r Simon.
he'll straighten it out.
Baxter was the best damn C. I.we've ever had, Director Vance.
for how long?
he's been workingndercover with the DEA for the past 12 months.
helped us shut down smugglers we've been after forever.
he was under DEA control for the last year?
had our eyes on him the whole time.
if you think he was involved with this, you're wrong.
somebody real good's been playing you folks.
so the person Dr. Ryan has been pushing, Gibbs, isn't our killer.
Cranston's sessions with Banks.
she's a quack.
no, she's not.
she's good, and it made listening all the harder,'cause...
he was in real trouble.
is that your apology about Baxter?
I have a job to do.
NCIS was looking into aa at a critical time.
we have protocols in place to protect our mission.
it's part of our rule book.
Yeah, well, I got some rules of my own, too.
rule number 42...
don't ever accept an apology from someone who just sucker-punched you.
I didn't apologize.
do you have children?
I did.
but you already know that.
Yes.
and I'm sorry.
Hey, Doc, my feet aren't pointing at the door.
the other day, I was picking up my son, Parker, from soccer practice, and he was...
walking toward the car, and not once...
did he look over his shoulder.
and that meant everything to me.
in my job, I take precautions, and I don't know how you found him, but...
I believe everybody deserves one secret, and...
I'm asking...
you if I can have this one.
okay.
thank you. I owe you...
assuming you'll let me know when you want to collect.
I want to collect now.
someone with your knowledge killed Banks.
I want to know who.
whoever it is has lost sight of...
who we are and what we do.
you got a name?
good luck.
Banks's psy-ops files are blocked, deleted or in no-go territory.
here.
try this.
it's Ryan's cell phone.
isolate calls from psy-ops, government-issuelines.
there's five or six different numbers here.
cross-reference with incoming calls to Banks over the past month.
uh, there's just one, boss, and they've placed multiple calls to Banks over the past two weeks.
no. Brian Mitchell.
the psy-ops liaison who was working with him directly.
no, wait a minute - there's a second cell number on Banks' account, and Mitchell sent dozens of tech streams to it.
put it up.
I can't. They've all been erased.
Ziva, you're with me.
they're in the cloud memory, but it'll take time.
DiNozzo, dial both numbers three times; hang up after one ring.
boss?
do it.
and keep sending me locations on Mitchell's cell.
it's a fail-safe call.
it's an old spy craft trick.
means something's going wrong.
parties are supped to meet at a predetermined location.
kind of a rookie move, isn't it?
Yeah. That's why it just might work.
why did you call me, Brian?
I came as soon as I could.
we agreed it wouldn't be safe.
this will never work.
you'll never have what you want if you don't listen.
you know what I want.
you don't deserve it.
you messed up big-time.
I made your father look unstable.
I gave him the drugs; I did what you said.
I said to make it look like he killed himself.
if they figure out I'm involved, I'll get nothing.
I want that money.
I just want you to be happy.
I want us to be happy.
this isn't about us anymore.
you killed my father, Brian.
I will not go down with you for this.
Oh, I'm afraid you are.
put your hands behind your back.
she's as guilty as I am.
he's lying.
no, he，he forced me to do this.
somehow, I doubt that.
that's a nice girl.
30 years, take her home to meet the folks.
amber used me, just like she used him.
and I never saw it coming.
I thought she was another broken teenager caught up in an ugly divorce.
doc...
you look for the good in people.
there...
there's not much to find.
Hey, Ziva and I are going for drinks.
you want to come?
only if you're buying.
agent DiNozzo.
Fred Seymour from Accounting!
actually, good news.
we traced the problem back to a clerical error, which resulted in overpayments to you, Agent McGee.
now the bad news.
thanks to your request that we review your file, uh, we discovered that we've been short on your FICA withholdings for the previous five years.
what? - So you owe us $2, 997. 33. Payable immediately.
enjoy your night.
What?!
we'll be at the bar if you want to drown your srows.
what the...? What?
Yeah. Gibbs.
what are you doing?
well. I'm sleeping. It's 4: 00 in the morning. What are you doing?
trying out my new phone.
my other one disappeared.
yeah? That what happened, huh?
sorry.
I don't get much sleep.
I've got a lot on my mind.
whose head you messing with tonight, Doc?
probably my own.
I shouldn't have called.
how can I help?
I just wanted to...
thank you for...
figuring out what happened to Robert.
doing my job.
I think you already knew, though.
you make people feel safe, Gibbs.
it's a gift.
well, people need answers.
I need breakfast.
okay. When?
how about now?
well, I, I know a little...
diner that's open 24 hours.
perfect.
are you asking me on a date, Ryan?
it's the middle of the night, Agent Gibbs.
you tell me.
ball cap.
heading for the exit!
what are you doing?
Yes, I love you.
it's the one I'vebeen waiting for.
Oh, does Karenhave a last name?
can't remember. - You can't remember?
no. But God bless her, she has just put me over the top.
I now have 1, 000 Facebook friends.
Ah, worked so hard for this.
friending everyone I've evergone to school with, worked with, dated or met.
toughest part for me was trolling through the hundreds and hundreds of random members for anyone willingto accept my invite.
you know how many criminals cruise the Internet picking through your chat logs looking for intelligence information?
you're not on Facebook, are you? - No.
MySpace? - No.
linkedin? - No.
twitter? - No.
Friendster... I'm an undercover agent.
I love Friendster.
it's not normal.
you're tellingme what's normal? I've never even seen you wear pants.
I meant Dom.
friendster's only popular in Southeast Asia now.
and normal's relative.
more often than not, online social networking communities are a pathetic attempt to fulfill the needs of the intersocially challenged.
you know, people fearful of face-to-face risk taking.
just a... theory.
what is this, Mr. Callen?
uh, that is a knit--combed cotton.
with a bloodstain.
I would never bleed on your wardrobe; had to be a bad guy.
good, bad or ugly, I don't care.
the point is, you neglected to tell me about it, and now it's set long enough so that it might be permanent.
Hetty, it's just a shirt.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is not just a shirt.
this is a Saville Row 100% polished Egyptian cotton, hand-stitched with pearl buttons.
that thing you're wearing isjust a shirt.
Yeah, but it's a comfy shirt.
your new color scheme is black.
I can live with black.
late night, huh?
agent Blye has beenon assignment.
how did it go, dearie?
uh, it went very well.
we gathered very important intel.
Hetty: That's wonderful.
uh, you can return your outfitto the wardrobe. Your clothes are waitingin your locker.
nice try, Hetty.
director Vance is on the systemin five. Move!
Hey, Eric?
why don't you make Hetty one of your Facebook friends?
she's friend number 251;she writes me every day.
in Greek.
the man you're looking at is aformer Marine
he's currently working forCitdential Security, one of the largest privatesecurity firms contracted by the US governmentin Iraq.
ten days ago, Flynn killed an Iraqi businessman that he was supposed to be protecting.
he went into hiding.
Citdential found out that he was on his way to LA.
tried to take him at the airportthis morning.
they made a mess of it.
one of their men ended up dead.
cowboys.
that's why the DOD wants usinvolved.
you can't have private securitycontractors operating like a police force onhome ground.
it's a political hot potato, so do not drop it.
we'll find him.
you can startwith Citdential's CEO.
his name is Peter Caldwell.
director?
Congratulationson the milestone.
Aw, thank you.
uh, Facebook. He's friend number 500.
just kind of honored.
after I became CEO, I personally recruited Flynn from the Marine Corps.
he was not only an operator but an Arabic speaker, and the company needed them.
three months ago, he started exhibiting behavioral problems.
he was trigger happy, started drinking heavily.
you left him on the line?
an oversight.
understatement.
so, what happened inBaghdad, Mr. Caldwell?
Flynn was partof a security detail protecting an Iraqi businessman.
nasir Amini was a key player in the country'sstability, especialla key player in the country'sstability, especially withy withthe start of the UStroop withdrawal.
Flynn snapped, took Amini out.
he got away before we could stop him.
flew out of the Middle Eastvia Istanbul. We got a report he was headedfor LA.
and we tried to apprehend himthis morning.
Yeah, that didn't go so well.
Aimes was a good friend. Flynn didn't need to kill him.
Flynn was one of our best.
he's trained to kill quicklyand efficiently.
he's even more dangerous now that he's mentally unstable.
we'd like to help you find him.
I think you guyshave done enough.
let us take it from here.
this is the security cam footage from LAX.
looks stressed.
travel can do that, particularly if you're on the run for murder.
background? - Broken home.
dad busted in a drug conspiracy when Flynn turned seven. Mom was a drunk
that's a great start.
ll, it gets better. even. String of fosteromes, a few trips to juvi.
he signed up for the Marines the day he turned 18.
the military gave him the family and structure thathe had never had.
the only other choicewould've been a gang.
why'd he pick one over the other?
it was a chance toget away from it all.
gangs give you structure, but they keep you in the same place.
military's all about starting over.
unless you start torepeat your behavior.
Flynn's military record shows commendations for bravery, but there's also a handful of side trips to the brig.
run the video, Eric.
Flynn bolted from the terminal with two Citdential agents on his tail.
outside the terminal, they chased him across three lanes of traffic, where a third Citdential picked him up as he ran into a parking garage.
Flynn evaded the agentsin a stolen car.
chase wound up on the roof.
when the agent started firing, Flynn mowed him down with the car and took off on foot.
brutal.
any other insights, Nate?
nada.
the question is, where did he go?
the logical answer would be, as far away from the airport aspossible.
Spock said,"Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
double back. - Double back.
fast-forward, Eric.
there's our guy. He went back to the terminal.
he was waiting for someone to pick him up.
Oh... double espressois speaking to me.
been hearing voices from caffeinated beverages long?
only since the brownies started giving me the silent treatment.
couple thingsyou guys should know about.
all ears. - Citdential sent overFlynn's psych profile.
it's pretty juicy stuff. - Baited breath. What else you got?
Hetty's in the kitchen.
all indicators point towards a psychotic break.
my guess is undiagnosed PTSD, complicated by his upbringing.
what about his upbringing?
possible abusein foster homes. Probably didn't knowwho his parents were or where he came from.
a childhood like that can cause major psychological
I get it.
uh, okay.
something I don't get is, uh, he might have hada breakdown in Iraq, but he certainly was lucid about his trip to L. A.
he could've got offthat plane on the East Coast, but instead, he flew straight here.
he's in L. A. for a reason.
rag-top Jeep. Surf racks on the roof. Bumper stickers on the rear.
rear license plate is blocked by the spare tire.
no plate on the front.
well, what kind of bumper stickers?
I had a handle on lifebut it broke.
don't steal, the governmenthates competition
and my personal favorite:
be sincere, whetheryou mean it or not
speaking of the driver...
no facial; tats on the left arm; male. Or female.
man. - Woman.
Yeah.
more on the tats.
Tabori style.
it's a traditionalform of tattooing. They use needlesinstead of a gun.
only a couple of placesdo that kind of work.
orange suggests impulsiveness.
the, uh, surf racks anadventurous nature.
the Jeep is youth.
or the pursuit of youth.
bumper stickers--a sense of humor, maybe contempt for authority.
the tats?
well, I can go one of two ways.
to an older generation, they're a sign of rebellion;
and to someone younger, because they're so ubiquitous, it might mean conformity.
so, basically, you don't have squat.
I'd say it's more of a broad spectrum of possibilities.
yeah... that's whatthey call squat.
there's something else.
a link to L. A.
a really, reallygood link to L. A.
Flynn's former foster brother owns a gun shop in the Valley.
Thanksgivingmust be a hoot.
you looking for someone?
one of my pit stops as a kid was a couple blocks from here.
wonder if I'm passinganyone I used to know.
not that it matters now.
if it didn't matter, youwouldn't have brought it up, G.
be there in a second.
what was your first like?
we're talking tats, right?
Yeah, we're talking tats.
San Diego-- I was 16;nervous as hell. Didn't really knowwhat to expect.
afterwards, it just kindof felt like a man, you know.
I don't know how elseto explain it.
we're talking tats, right? - Yeah.
what can I do for you?
uh... this your work?
did it about two years ago.
chick named Cherry.
does Cherryhave a last name?
world's full of peoplewith no last name.
sting, Prince...
cops?
would it make a difference?
I don't have time for this, okay? She paid in cash.
that's all I know.
if you don't mind, I have a customer waiting.
can't be many places left.
nowhere you're ever gonna see.
why would Chad Ellis's gun store be closed on a weekday?
better question is why is the door unlockedif the store's closed?
careful, Dom.
lucky escape for the cat.
for Chad, not so much.
I cross-checkedthe name "Cherry"with orange Jeeps, through DMV, and I got a hiton a Cherise Dawson.
from there it was cake.
opened her electronic belly up like a pop-up book.
work and home addresses.
phone numbers and logs.
e-mail address entry and we are just getting warmed up.
guess whereshe went to high school.
no? Ridgewell Highin Springfield, Missouri. Guess who else went there?
feeling the love? - That's right. Walton Monroe Flynn.
and-- you ready for this?
she's one ofyour Facebook friends.
not mine.
Walton Monroe Flynn's.
a few months ago, he "friended her
now, for you older guys, that's the lingo for when someone asks you into their friends list.
what's the lingo for when someone smacks youwith a flip-flop?
okay, so, um, uh, for a couple weeks he played the"catch up" game--you know, nothing revealing
and then it stopped.
well, that's not unusual.
after the first blush ofcuriosity wanes, the realization sets in that most of these old acquaintances have nothing in common any more, and communication ends.
Ah, but here is the flyin the psychological ointment.
a week ago, Flynn contacted her again.
and, uh, said hewas coming to L. A. wanted to re-connectin person.
put Flynn and Cheriseup side by side.
what are you thinking, G?
Callen: She looks innocent.
no, he's using her.
might be for money, it might for a place to crash, but he's using her.
you could be right.
you know, you guys, something's bothering me about the gun shop murder.
coroner said that Chad Elliswas beaten to death.
there were two pistols missing from the inventory.
I mean, if this iswhat Flynn wanted, why not just take them? Why torture him?
he wasan interrogator in Iraq.
he could'vegotten a taste for it.
maybe.
we should keep a quietread on our two leads, see what shakes up.
would you like herhouse or her work?
now, you're sure aboutthis census taker thing?
no, not just census takers, Sam.
census takers for a community action organization for social justice.
look, Cherise is a tattooedVenice hippie chick.
she'll practicallyinvite us to move in.
not home.
or she is and she ended up like Chad.
clear. - Clear.
Hmm... Ginseng iced tea...
soy milk...veggie burgers...
...half a cheese steaksandwich.
left us a present.
yeah?
Oh, my God, is that you?
Regina Sanders? Ridgewell High?
uh, oh, come on, I haven't changed that much, have I?
all right, I do have to confess
I have had a little workdone, but I'm still me.
just a little more in some places, and a little less in others, depending on what body partwe're talking about.
I'm... I'm... so...
you don't remember me, do you?
I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. Don't even.
it was a huge high schooland I wasn't exactly"Miss Popularity
well, look, I reallyhave to go to work
this is so cool thatwe met like this!
I have so been thinking about senior year recently.
ever since I got an invite onFacebook from Walton Flynn.
remember him? - Uh, kinda.
I was his lab partner in chem for, like, a semester.
whoever thought thathe would remember me?
I do admit I did havea little crush on him.
but then again, I did have a crush on pretty much anyone who wore pants.
except for Darlene Caporale, but that was a different story, if you know what I mean.
right? So, have you spoken toWalton since graduation?
no. I don't mean to be rude, but I am late for work, so...
Absolutely! Amazing to see you!
well... Okay, bye!
what do you got?
our girl practicallyjumped out of her skin when I mentioned Flynn.
indications he might'vebeen here. Eric's checking some fingerprints we pulled off an empty bottle.
what's the plan?
Eric's monitoring the homephone, cell, Facebook page.
we're just about finished wiring the place, and then we just wait and watch.
all right. Wait and watch.
wait and watch.
is that a frog?
it's a swan.
from where, Chernobyl?
is that a wing?
Yeah, it's a wing. - Why are there three of them?
there aren't three of them. That's the tail.
the tail"?
nothing
I just didn't knowthat swans had tails.
well, they do.
a duck has a tail, right?
maybe.
Oh, it could be a duck then?
keep it up. You're going to have to duck.
I'm just saying.
what?
is everything okay?
great. - Cherise just pulledinto her street.
got her.
we can take it from here, unless... - Thank you.
company.
Eric, we've gotan SUV behind us.
license plate: three, India, Delta, Whiskey, six, seven, four.
got it.
think that's our man, Flynn?
I don't know, but if it is, he's not alone. There's two of them.
all right, it's a fleetvehicle registered to our Citdential Security friends.
didn't Sam make it clearto those guys this is our investigation?
what do you want me to do?
I got it.
what is she doing?
Oh, we've been made.
you boys need me to call a tow truck?
we're good. - Okay.
no sign of Flynn.
not even a phone call. Cherise was home all night.
so why is this guy here?
all right, we need to be more proactive than just a stake out.
what are you thinking?
I think we get close to her at work.
who's good at video games?
back in the days, I was pretty money at Donkey Kong.
Yeah.
Nate's profile did suggest that she's attractedto bad boy types who need saving.
did he?
these were on sale at Lucky Brand.
they, uh, they already have rips, so a few more won't matter.
I thought we were going all black?
well, sometimes damaged goods can actually be more valuable because of their uniquequalities.
is that right?
mm, it's a thought.
I will try and take good care of them.
don't try.
just do.
for your UltraSoftinterview:
resume and a little dirty laundry on the manager.
it should work like a charm.
well, I'm sorry, Mr. Wells. We, um, we really don't have anything for you.
you haven't evenlooked at my resume.
okay. Well, I'm sureyou're more than qualified.
let me guess-- you've been, uh, gaming since you werea little boy, experience on all platforms and genres.
you, uh, you have previousemployment in the field, glowing recommendations...
am I close?
very. - Yeah.
well, unfortunately, that's also the, uh, the history of the other 22 applicants on the list ahead of you.
so, I'm sorry.
well... I guesswe'll both be sorry.
I'll be out of a job and you'll be in trouble.
okay, well, uh, I do likeyour confidence, Mr. Wells.
and, uh, you know what? I'll even bite.
what do you havethat no one else does?
what's under that resumeyou haven't read.
where did you get this?
Where's not important.
that I won't talk about your creative tax return is.
shall we? - Yeah.
all right, this is you.
now, let's, uh...Let's see if you'reas good a gamer as you are an extortionist.
welcome to Warrior Wing.
possible motivefor the killing in Iraq.
Amini wasn't a fan of theAmerican military presence, and especiallythe private security firms.
he wasn't shy about letting everyone know it, too.
Eric, you there? - You guys, Callen's in trouble.
got a situation here.
I'm pulling upyour computer now.
bug problem--really big bug problem.
all right, you're upagainst a Deavil-droid.
you have to transformyourself into a Dweed.
I already feel likea dweeb sitting here.
not a "dweeb"" a "dweed
it's a combination between a dwarf and a steed.
all right, grab yourtreasure torch and...
okay, not good. Not good.
you have used up17 virtual life-forces. One more and you die.
okay, we need to go to Plan B, Eric, and fast.
all right, you got it.
you hear that, Sam? - On it.
mission accomplished. Lights out.
listen up, everybody. It's a building-widepower outage.
engineering saysthey're not going to have it up anytime soon.
I guess we got the day off. - Yeah.
okay, she's just left the building.
you've got about 20 seconds.
is that a real 20 seconds, 20 seconds give or take?
uh, more like five now.
Oh, yeah, great. I'm trapped under the next car over.
do I have to do allthe heavy lifting around here?
it sounds like the starter. Let me take a look.
Thanks. - No problem.
Oh, yeah. Your solenoid's fried.
is that bad?
well, you could tow itto a mechanic or I could switch it out tomorrow.
you can do that? - I can.
well, you're a geekand a gear head.
Yeah, I also cook. - Nice.
I'll tell you what. Let me give you a ride home.
Oh, no. - Which way you headed?
you've done enough. I can call a cab. - No way.
we geeks need to stick together.
I'll grab my bag.
all right. - Sweet!
well, I'll betyou didn't realize you'd have to work so hardon your first day.
how can I thank you?
that depends on howthreatening you think a bathroomand a beer would be.
uh, considering my boyfriend's gonna be home any second, I don't think I have a lot to worry about.
Yeah. - Sounds good.
in position.
back lane's covered.
I hope he realizes how lucky he is.
well, we hardly knew each otherin high school.
when we reconnected out here, it just happened so fast.
I still can't believe it.
heads up, people.
our boy's here. Lock and load.
soon as you say the word, G,I'm comingthrough the front door.
he's entering the house. Stand by everyone.
Hey, babe. - Hey, baby.
Oh, Steve works with me.
he gave me a ride homewhen my Jeep died.
you want me to get you a beer?
it's my first day. I didn't realize I'd be dealing with "Talisman IV: Warlordsof the Vesuvian Moon
and a solenoid, so...
Yeah, never gotinto the gaming thing.
Yeah, well, it's just...
you know, something thatkept me away from dealing with all the crap at home when I was a kid, so...
Yeah. Good to meet you. - Thanks.
AR. Don't hate
can't hate anyone who served.
Iraq? - Two tours.
Oh, it's rough.
Yeah. Not as rough as after.
come on. What is he waiting for?!
why isn't he giving usthe signal to go in?
tand by. We've got some action out here.
G, company, front door. Coming in hot and fast.
DOM, maintain your position!
get down! Flynn!
stand down! Stand down!
holster your weapon! Holster your weapon.
we're okay.
what was that? Collecting our man.
we were doing our job.
no, you were doing our job. If you'd done your job in the first place, we wouldn't be here cleaning up your mess.
Hey, hey, hey, look. - Stop!
look, all right, we jumped the gun, all right? Our bad.
but he killed one of our own. You know how that feels.
and I also know about the rules of engagementand a code of conduct.
now, get out of here before I forget.
you okay?
you're not a game tester, are you?
did Flynn saywhy he came to see you?
well, I wanted to believeit was because he liked me.
maybe he does.
it was the SIM card.
he gave you a SIM card?
I downloaded it for him. It was encrypted.
he tried to pretend like it wasn't important to him, but he wanted meto decode it for him.
I couldn't. I mean, the card was damaged.
I'm a testernot a programmer. What did he expect?
Oh, everything he told me was a lie.
maybe not everything.
it's him. - Are you okay?
look, I'm sorry, okay? I'll explain everything later. Put your friend on.
yeah?
I didn't do what they said I did.
okay. Well, why don'twe meet somewhere and you can tell mewhat really happened?
I've got unfinished business.
what kind of business?
gotta cut the head off the snake.
then I'm a ghost.
tell Cherise...tell her I'm sorry.
I think you ought to tell her yourself.
you and I both know it doesn't work that way.
te me what?
he told me I'm supposedto stay away from you.
I guess he reallydoes like you.
this SIM card is pretty messed up.
but it has something to do with what Citdentialwas doing in Iraq.
Flynn may havelost it in Baghdad, but whatever he's doinghere is different.
this is planned.
enlarge that Citdential logo, will you?
bigger.
he's going to take downCaldwell
Citdential's CEO.
cutting the head off the snake.
Eric. Get me Caldwell's schedule.
and I need to knowwhat's on that SIM card, now.
right. Tonight, he's giving a speech on Middle East securityfor a global conference at the HollywoodRoosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard.
Oh, couldn't be more public. When Caldwell gets out of his carat the hotel entrance, he's going to be completely exposed.
the perfect place to make a hit.
wait. I got it.
the SIM card's a video.
one hell of a video.
okay, Kensie, we're outside the Roosevelt.
here comes Caldwell. Talk to me, Kensie.
Eric, do we have anymore camera angles?
wait! I've got him.
Flynn on the move.
Flynn, drop your weapons! Stand down!
caldwell: Keep your positions!
Flynn: You know what this is about, Caldwell.
Eric, they need to seethe SIM card video now.
I'm already on it.
there's an electronicbillboard above the club across the street at Madame Tussauds.
can you do it?
uh, maybe.
you don't have to do this.
if I'm going down, this son of a bitch is going with me.
we decoded the SIM card.
Callen, it's on the screenacross the street
Madame Tussauds.
look! Behind you! Look at the screen!
take him out!
guess that leaves just you.
video is from a mini cam that was mounted on Flynn's gun.
kind of like a dashboard camin a cop car.
so Caldwell takes Amini out and sets up Flynnto take the fall.
then, tortures his foster brother Chad Ellis to death.
shrinks have a term for someonelike that, Doc?
Yeah.
really screwed up.
DOD will do your intake locally, then they'll ship you off to D. C.
for protective custodyuntil the trial's over.
Yeah, right.
and one day, we'll bothlive in the burbs, barbeque with our neighbors and coach Little League.
I don't know.
teaching your son how to play baseball sounds petty idyllic.
Yeah, it does.
but that's why we do what we do, so others can live those lives.
when Caldwell goes on trial, if he goes to trial...
he'll do whatever ittakes to keep youfrom testifying
protective custody or not.
the man does have access.
probably got half the Joint Chiefs on his speed dial.
Yeah.
what are you doing?
Oh, how clever.
a duck.
I know. I know, Mom.
but at least it's not as ugly as divorce court.
Thanks, Mom.
Yeah, I'm trying.
okay, I love you, too. Bye.
Morning,G.
when did that happen?
Hey, guys.
who did this?
don't know.
Where's all our stuff? - Don't know.
think it's safe to go in.
don't know.
I'm saying I think it's safe to go in.
am I seeing assigned seats?
Yep, I'm here.
this is nice, nice!
Oh, look, they even sharpened my pencils.
do you write with pencils? - No.
could be one of Nate's psych experiments.
I'm not one of Nate's lab rats.
you ever known me to receive mail? - Nope.
send mail? - Nope.
organization and productivity are directly correlated.
cleanliness is next to, um...
efficiency.
so, you moved our stuff?
I tried to stop her.
Hetty. She's the only one...
continue, Mr. Callen, continue.
with the authority...
hmm, Nate, if your comment that "they might be miffed" constitutes trying to stop me,
I suggest you learn more forceful techniques of self-assertion.
not that I would have listened.
people, this is an office.
insofar as you have equipment necessary to your duties, you'll find it in your desks.
insofar as you had "stuff," you'll find it all upstairs in trash bags.
most of it's Kensi's.
you're welcome to add a personal touch or two.
but let's not again have it looking like a fraternity lounge.
now, if you'll follow me, we have work.
chief Petty Officer Frank McEllon was murdered last night.
he was one of the Navy's top engineers.
he worked on super-cavitation. Really cool technology.
puts a bubble around a submarine, quadruples its speed.
from 25 knots top speed fully submerged to 100 knots.
nifty trick. - A trick you'd want to keep secret.
murder and possible espionage.
both balls are in your court, Mr. Callen.
Hey, new bullpen's great, huh?
an enlisted sailor lives here?
it's a little too upmarket, isn't it?
way upmarket.
mobiles go over cribs, right?
looks like baby moved out.
probably not by herself.
now, the alarm system showed this window open just before the murder.
Eric... there's a house directly behind us. They have a security cam.
Thanks.
so, McEllon hears a noise, then he comes in.
killer takes him from behind, no struggle.
McEllon's six foot. So, the killer's strong, he's quiet.
knows how to use a knife.
Hey, guys.
what do you see?
huh... dusted for prints, but there aren't any.
this was the only window open, so he came and went through here.
the whole crime scene is like this.
do you know what the forensics report is going to find?
absolutely nothing. No prints, fibers, hairs.
this guy didn't leave a trace.
nanny Cam.
with a front-row seat.
okay, Eric, thanks. - Keep looking, Dom.
Dom's trying to track down McEllon's wife.- Eric says that the window the killer used.
the killer knew - The wife split a month...
was I heads or tails?
I'm not telling you.
the window that the killer used was not covered by the security camera out back.
our guy must've cased the house first then.
but Eric found another camera next door.
now, this is video from four days ago.
he's running facial recognition, but there's been no hits yet.
and now it's your turn, Sam.
McEllon's wife split with the baby a month ago.
Dom's still trying to track her down.
financials? - Turns out McEllon's money is clean.
he designed sub technology before he joined the Navy.
his patents are lucrative.
why would a wealthy engineer enlist?
same reason Pat Tillman left the NFL to join the Army.
patriotism.
McEllon signed on after 9/11.
so, a patriotic guy sells secrets?
that would make him unpatriotic, Kensi.
you were tails, for the record.
can I have my phone, please? Thank you very much.
feels weird.
I like it.
I'm over here, you're way over there.
you see the forensics report? - No.
it's right there in your in-box.
I thought it was the out-box.
Kensi was right. The killer left no DNA.
no fibers, no hairs, no prints, nothing.
never seen anything like it.
Thanks.
agent Callen, Agent Hanna.
director.
NSA completed a preliminary review.
sub program's security protocols do not appear to have been breached.
espionage or not, this case is still a priority.
that's why I'm sending our top forensic specialist to assist you.
but there are no forensics.
our forensic expert has a theory about this crime that's, shall we say, original.
thinks McEllon is the victim of a serial killer.
no other law enforcement organization in this country thinks this killer even exists.
can't say I do either.
and you're sending this person why?
I was ganged up on.
who gangs up on the director of a federal agency?
Oh, you'd be surprised, Mr. Callen.
and who's the expert? - Oops, I think I took a wrong turn.
Hello? - Abby? We're in here.
there you are.
wow, this place is seriously cool.
so, how do you...?
double tap, get the menu, fill the screen. It's all very intuitive.
no wonder McGee can't stop talking about this.
so, I'm sure Leon has told you that I know who killed McEllon.
wait, you call him Leon?
you don't? - Not successfully.
give it time.
you have a name for us, Abby?
he's called the Phantom.
by whom? - By me.
anyone else?
no, just me.
well, I'm-I'm going to leave you kids to it.
but I must say, Abby, you are the first NCIS employee I've ever met with a sense of style.
you'd all do well to note that one can be functional and stylish at the same time.
right, Mr. Beale?
so, Abby, the forensics report has no evidence of the killer.
that's why I call him the Phantom.
14 murders in two years.
I mean, it took me a while to see his pattern.
but, okay, pull up the list of his murders, please.
this is a private Web site for forensic specialists.
Abby's a rock star among them.
I've been blogging about the Phantom for a few months.
I'm trying to get local police departments to pursue him.
a 67-year-old black female poisoned in Tampa.
the killer left nothing. No hair, no DNA, no fibers. Zippity-do-dah.
22-year-old white male shot in Des Moines.
no trace of a killer.
37-year-old Asian female in Boise.
with a crowbar!
do you know how hard it is to cudgel someone to death with a crowbar and leave no forensic evidence?
the cases with zero forensics are rare.
like every few years kind of rare. And this is 14 in two years.
okay. Have any of the local PD's pursued this Phantom theory?
not one. I mean, can you believe that?
now, serial killers are either organized or disorganized.
this guy's organized in leaving no forensics.
but completely disorganized in everything else.
I mean, random victims, weapons, locations.
it just doesn't look like one single killer.
he makes it look random on purpose.
that's how I knew that McEllon was a Phantom victim.
not just the no forensics part, but he never repeats himself.
like he's never cut the neck of a 40-year-old white guy before, see?
clearly, you've spent a lot of time on this.
if you wanna get my attention, show me a crime scene and tell me there's no clues.
Oh, we have a clue.
this guy.
casing the house three days before the murder.
whoa, okay.
the Phantom's not really the kind of guy to let himself get caught on camera.
but three days prior, scoping the place out? Maybe he's finally slipped up.
I'm just curious why you pressured Vance to send Abby.
he wasn't buying her Phantom theory.
he needed goosing.
so you want us chasing the Phantom?
Mr. Callen, is that what you think?
I don't know.
there's... there's been some meddling around here, and I'm a little fuzzy on the command chain.
this case lacks forensics.
as your operations manager, I procured for you our best scientist. To help you.
you, as head agent, are free to pursue whatever theory of crime makes the most sense.
there's no fuzziness, Callen.
you still shoot the ducks.
I just row the boat.
what is he holding, a rabbit?
he misses his little girl.
hang on.
let me see here, and here.
it's the same fabric, top and bottom.
overalls? - It's a full bodysuit.
that explains it! He doesn't leave it, he takes it with him!
takes what with him?
hair, and fibers, and skin.
evidence.
every day we lose 50, 000 dead epidermal cells-- that's 1. 5 pounds per year.
we have to go to this crime scene.
Abby, the crime scene is done.
Yeah, and they found nothing.
so you want to go, why?
because I think I can find something.
all right.
CSI guys tracked through dirt.
the scene's completely contaminated, Abby.
I'm not looking for footprints that leave dirt, I'm looking for footprints that remove dirt.
okay, so you're thinking that... Come with me.
smart thinking, Abby. You live up to the hype.
dom found e-mails from Magda McEllon threatening to kill her husband.
I'm going to need to talk to her.
got to find her first.
yo, Callen·Sam. In here.
so, most footwear is electrically neutral.
but some bodysuits made for chemical workers or doctors, they have a tiny electrostatic charge.
electrostatic charges, they pick up dust.
just like those dust cloths you see advertised on late night TV.
you know about cleaning products?
you watch late night TV?
I can get the full pattern from his bootie in this dust here, and then I can find you the make and a manufacturer.
thank you, Abby Sciuto.
you're welcome, G.Callen.
so where do we start looking for Magda McEllon?
zuggler-smith. I hate lawyers.
ms. Jenkins has left for lunch.
see, I told you she said the restaurant.
Oh, there she is.
enjoy your lunch.
thank you.
my job, I deal with a lot of jerks.
Frank McEllon was a real gentleman.
even to his wife, who demanded two-thirds of his submarine patents...
things he had invented before they even met.
you advised him to fight.
with the future value, hell, yes.
they're already a gravy train if he can afford to hire you.
you're cute.
Frank told me they'd be worth a lot more soon.
top secret and all, but that had to mean the Navy liked his inventions.
that's a lucky wife. She's a widow, not an ex.
so Magda McEllon gets it all.
so, um, when your people went to serve her with the papers, where'd they go?
five years married to a button-down Navy guy.
she splits, moves down here to get a taste of the crazies.
I used to live here.
well, you and crazy speaks for itself.
that's her.
Oh, she's fast.
fast for a short girl.
I said she's fast. I said she's short.
nanny Cam, McEllon's killer was the same height as he was.
she's got the motive, she's just not tall enough.
but he is.
that's the guy that was casing McEllon's house.
boyfriend-girlfriend. She's not even divorced yet.
did you see other partners after I was shot?
Oh, no, I'm a loyal guy, G.
think old lover boy over there's loyal?
loyal enough to do Magda's bidding?
what do you think, ten bucks?
don't do it.
now, is that a casual walking away or a I-see-two-guys-that-may- be-law-enforcement walking away?
I might look like law enforcement.
yeah? What do I look like?
like you grew up here.
watch out!
you hurt?
good.
I'll talk, you get the video.
okay.
make sure you zoom in on her reaction.
you're on.
so what's your name?
that's funny. You don't actually look like a cyrus.
facial recognition says that your name is ted brock.
why'd you run?
I thought you were going to steal my stuff.
it had nothing to do with the two outstanding arrest warrants?
so, basically, What you do is you butter up rich ladies And then you steal their things.
what I want to know is,
where were you last night?
I had a date. Mm-hmm.
with magda mcellon.
I'm special agent kensi blye. I need to speak with you.
please have a seat.
this is, uh, difficult.
I'm sorry to have to tell you, but...
Um...Your husband was murdered last night. I'm sorry.
Oh, my god.
how? Where?
in his house.
I'm really sorry, but I need to ask you this.
where were you last night?
I took magda to dinner at the ivy.
I-I was... I was here, with-with lilly, my baby.
and lilly?
she hired a babysitter.
we only have child care daytimes.
I'll take her story over his.
facial cues: Eyebrows, parted lips.
her surprise is genuine. She didn't know.
guys, she just skewered his alibi, Let's get to motive.
tell me something.
how long have you known this man?
Cyrus? A few weeks. Why?
actually, his name is ted.
Ted, I'm guessing that you wanted the submarine patents that Magda would get if her husband was dead.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
did you tell ted about your husband's patents?
Yes.
by mistake. I was...
pissed off after a phone call from frank's lawyer.
he knows about the patents, g.
Magda just called you a liar.
she's out there?
she can hear me?
you weren't with her last night. You knew about the patents
and that she might lose them in the divorce.
so you went to mcellon's house last night, and you killed him.
now she is a rich widow, and she dates you.
wait, that-that-that isn't true.
magda! I-I didn't kill anybody!
you cased the house four days ago.
the security camera across the street.
that's why you picked a different window last night When you killed him.
I-I didn't kill him!
then why did you case the house, Ted?
Magda said he kept ten grand in bearer bonds.
I saw the security camera. I didn't go in. I'm not a b&e guy.
so, where were you last night?
Brentwood.
lady friend.
she rich?
so, what happened to lover boy brock?
he was what he said he was. So we turned him over to lapd for those outstanding warrants.
and back to square one.
Magda's not involved, we've pretty much ruled out espionage.
we have a killer who wears fancy suits and studies security cams.
we're missing motive.
maybe because it's random.
Abby got you on board?
he wishes.
so, um, do you guys know about the birthday paradox?
Abby discusses it on her blog.
how many people do you need in a room to have an even chance that two of them have the same birthday?
I don't know. 182 and a half.
only 23.
and with 57 people it's a 99% chance that two of them have the same birthday.
true randomness includes repeats.
a truly random group of murders would have at least two white males in their 20s.
Yeah, or two gunshot deaths. Or two stabbing deaths.
but there are no repeats.
it's hard to do.
if the M.O. is to make it all appear random, then why kill Mcellon when there are so many other easy targets?
and if it is the phantom, then he changed his M. O..
now, why would he do that?
Hey, so, good news. Flagstaff pd's going back to their crime scene.
jose pion, electrocuted in his bathtub five weeks ago.
I told them to look for dust prints. I hope nobody cleaned the floor.
so, um... So that's the, Uh... The bootie pattern?
Yep. It was left inversely in the dust on the floor at the Mcellons' house.
it's a pattern from a haz-mat suit made by ProtectorSuits, inc.
I e-mailed them for a distribution list, but they're not open till morning.
well, So, then, if we have to wait until...
until morning, then...
are you trying to ask me out, Eric?
Yeah. - Okay, just checking. Go ahead.
maybe, uh, a drink at, say, steampunk?
it's only the coolest place I wanted to go, but never been west of the mississippi. Yes.
how did you know about steampunk?
uh, you mentioned it online somewhere.
you've been reading my blog... A lot.
so, along with seeing this awesome club, I also want to see the museum of jurassic technology and the car museum. Oh.
have you seen out back? There's hot rods everywhere.
Yeah. This is where they hang out. That's what makes this place so cool.
and I want to see an earthquake.
well, I-I mean, I know you can't see an earthquake,
but I-I want to feel one. I mean, the whole earth shaking?
I mean, just a small one, where no people or animals get hurt.
but doesn't it feel cool?
Yeah, I-I guess it feels kind of funky.
when-when no one gets hurt.
um, do you want another, uh... Whatever this is?
you're on refills.
I'm going to go check out the hot rods.
Flagstaff pd found footprints in the dust. Same size, same pattern.
Abby's right... The phantom's real.
my god, I am buying that woman a beer.
I'll buy her a brewery, but I still need to know, why mcellon?
the phantom's other victims were all easier targets.
that's not the only difference.
all the other cases happened in smaller cities with pds that didn't have the resources to nationalize the case.
but now los angeles?
second biggest pd in the country.
and he gets ncis involved.
a federal agency. That's not random.
you hit Mcellon because of NCIS.
Yeah, but what does that get you, other than caught?
it gets you Abby Sciuto.
the one person calling attention to you when you're trying like hell to stay off the radar.
he must have had access to her blog.
she only reported her phantom theory on her closed forum.
he hacks into that, sees that she's a threat, kills someone from the navy to draw her out.
where is she?
they went to a bar.
a place she talked about before online.
Eric. - Hey, Callen.
you guys should come down here. This place is awesome.
what?
where was she abducted?
in a dark parking lot, Leon.
no video, and so far, no witnesses.
Nate, I want brass tacks.
the good news is, he abducted her instead of killing her outright.
probably wants to gloat and show her he's superior.
the bad news is, She does pose a major threat to him,
so he will kill her. Probably soon.
all right.
you keep me in the loop.
Gibbs and his team are en route to manassas airport.
he's trying to get a favor with the fbi to borrow their g5.
he'll be with you by midday.
let's pray Abby has that long.
excuse me, excuse me.
excuse me.
have you seen this woman?
Hey! I'm talking to you.
I don't care, big muggle cop without a warrant.
listen!
I don't know what "muggle" means, but I don't have time for this, Marilyn Manson.
Sam, let's do this all at once.
this woman was abducted from here 30 minutes ago.
anyone see anything?
anyone? We need your help.
she was here with a blonde dude.
Creepy-looking guy in flip-flops.
he's okay. Anyone else? Please.
anyone? Her name is abby.
please, we need your help.
please.
she's a friend of mine.
guy came in yesterday. Gave me this.
he said she was an old friend. Asked me to text him if she came in.
he gave me 100 bucks.
what did he look like?
like you. Like the blonde guy she was here with.
he and I don't really look alike.
I'm sorry. All muggles look the same.
okay, we've identified every person who's had access to Abby's online forum,
except one. Check out mike287. He mentions steampunk.
he suggests that she'd love it if she went to l. A.
post is two months old, which means he's been planning it for that long.
Yeah, he's setting a lot of bait.
who is mike287? Come on, guys. Bust down his door.
poses as Mike Kinkirk, l.A. County criminalist.
the real Kinkirk has been in hospice for months.
he's using onion routers to hide the computer he posts from, but I'm pretty sure he's actually in l. A.
that makes sense. All this planning to lure out Abby,
and like Callen was saying, it's a lot more work than he's ever had to do before.
easier to do it in a familiar place.- Home-field advantage.
okay, the encrypted phone that the bar woman sent the text to belongs to zuggler-smith.
that's Mcellon's law firm.
they bought 30 secure phones for their attorneys six months ago.
that's not all they bought.
they took delivery of a whole bunch of haz-mat suits.
deliveries going back two years.
that's when the phantom started killing. - So, he's a lawyer?
figures. - Yeah, but which lawyer?
doesn't say who actually received the suits, and we don't know who the firm issued the phone to.
I'm firing up the ops center now.
law firm's our only lead.
we go undercover.
are you comfortable?
I can't move.
it's, uh... just a little chemical...
it's, uh... just a little chemical restraint. It'll wear off slowly.
you'll start feeling your fingers and your toes first.
so, it's not quite a creepy dungeon.
I made it for you, Abby.
you who named me.
phantom.
if I could have caught you, I would have.
and yet, I caught you.
you went right where I asked you to go.
you're mike287.
you making a little abby movie?
Oh, that's for watching you when I go to work.
I took the day off today so we could be together.
after all, Abby,
we're a team.
there's no "i" in your team.
you'll resist at first,
and maybe I'll wait for you to come around.
or... Maybe I won't.
the only people coming around are my friends.
and they're going to smash through the door...
wherever the door is...
and they're going to put you in prison where you belong.
creep. - Couple of things.
first, anyone comes in here, the place bursts into flames.
butane. And second, I'm good at what I do. - You're the definition of the opposite of good.
in part, thanks to you.
I won't wear the suit on smooth floors anymore.
there will be no more phantom footprints.
I didn't blog about that.
no, you told flagstaff pd.
they posted it when they found them.
and, by the way, don't call me a creep!
you're right.
we just met.
it's not polite to judge.
I just...
I have this... this itch.
it's... right on the tip of my nose.
could you just help me, please?
don't you dare!
calm... Calm.
that's what you look like.
who's better, Zuggler or Smith?
for what, ma'am? - For getting every stinking penny.
you've come to the right place.
have a seat, please.
I don't believe it.
I was here first, you weasel.
so, you're going to spend my money to screw me out of my money?
so hard you're going to want to crawl back to the sewer you came from.
all right, that's it. - Don't do it.
don't touch me. Give back my purse. Don't touch me!
fine.
see if they take your business. Huh!
how are you going to pay the retainer?
I froze you out of all the accounts.
or maybe they'll take in-kind contributions, like you so freely gave to the pool guy. - Shut up.
and the gardener. - Security to the front, please.
and the driver, and the personal trainer. - Shut up. You shut up!
know what? Security to the front, please.
you are crazy... - No!
no, no, no. Security. You are crazy!
one crazy woman!- Security.- You know that? Get off of me!
sir! Easy, miss. Easy. Let her go.
it's all right. Go back into your offices.
it's under control. I gave you everything! I'm in. Which way do I go, Eric?
okay, I think you want the last room on your left.
you think? - It's not like we had a lot of time to plan, Sam.
I hacked the surveillance system, buzzed through a lot of old video, and caught a woman giving out a cell phone.
she's the chief admin.
she keeps a roster in her right desk drawer.
it's the best I got.
capturing video now.
got it, Sam.
I'll do it, Ms. Jenkins.
by tomorrow, thanks.
Hey, how are you?
we had a little thing up front.
Oh, okay.
Hey, Kensi? - On her way back.
guys, I found who the phone was signed out to.
Mike Smith, founding partner.
I hacked into his computer, it's been idle for two days.
I don't think he's been at work.
he logs on as mike287 and visits abby's blog regularly.
I'm sending you his license.
address is 287 bruckner.
Oh, boy.
Abby's alive!
he's streaming live video from his house to his computer at work.
at least I hope it's live. He's with her.
all right, we're ten minutes out.
hold on, hold on. This can't be his house.
the room she's in looks like it doesn't have any windows.
it's gotta be a commercial space. I'm thinking...
Yeah, 458 north fig. The law office is expanding to the building next door.
smith owns it.
we're standing right in front of it.
Eric said no windows.
basement!
guys, he's moving towards her.
he's not the phantom.
we're in the wrong place.
so was he.
he's been dead two or three days, Eric.
the phantom works in the law firm. Smith, his boss, gets suspicious so he kills him.
I bet there's no forensics in there either.
Sam, we got him. Check your phone.
mike287 posts from Smith's work computer.
at those specific timecodes, we found this guy.
the receptionist.
front desk at the law firm.
male receptionist is Tom Smith.
your dead guy's his uncle Mike.
if the boss is your uncle, you have the run of the place.
so, wherever he's got abby, He's probably got the run of that place, too.
okay, there's nothing in Tom's name, but his uncle has a dozen-- real estate holdings.
office buildings, warehouses, it could be any of them.
so we check them all out. We'll take half, Kensi and Dom, you take the other half.
Eric, find out if lapd can lend a hand.
already on it. - Oh, and Eric.
eyes on Abby?
still streaming.
what's the bed for?
to you, who empower me.
wait, he's toasting her? I thought he was gonna gloat.
what's with the wine and the bed?
men love women who appreciate them, and she alone has appreciated him.
I don't buy it. He's too smart.
he knows she's his downfall. He knows that she won't come around.
at best he's just playing with her.
playing, like chess?
more like a bear with a salmon.
you must have been good at math.
good at everything. - So, Tampa? That was your first?
my fifth.
so, what four did I miss?
well, they were before the suit.
my first was in Chico.
my first human, I mean.
animals, whew...Before that there were dozens of animals.
that's how I knew I was built for this,
really-- I just couldn't stop killing animals.
it was such intense pleasure.
it's not fun. It's awful.
and you are awful.
every person and animal that you killed had a life,
and people that loved them and deserved them alive.
I'm not on your side.
I've never been on your side, and I will never be on your side.
I know.
but it was fun to pretend.
do you want to pretend?
buy yourself another night of life?
after all, you'll be able to move soon.
look at that.
and look at this.
four down, eight to go. Kensi?
make that five down, seven to go.
got two black and whites dispatching now.
we don't have time to search seven buildings, even with local pd.
find where that camera is now!
camera's fixed, there's no swing.
wait, I do have zoom. - Zoom out, Eric.
go wide so we can see the building.
Eric? Eric! - I don't believe it.
she's signing to the camera; that's sign!
do you read sign language?
since I was seven. She's finger spelling.
all right,"noise" something.
I can't read. It's like when someone's mumbling. Her fingers are slurred.
noise...
Construction...construction noise! That's half the message.
then start looking for construction sites.
Callen, there's a warehouse on the corner of 6th and ardmore owned by Smith.
construction down the block.
on our way.
the truth is, you're just not smart enough for me, Abby.
because you're there and I'm here.
and now the great forensic specialist dies without any evidence of her killer.
and it will be fun for me, Abby.
I've almost got the second half of the message.
uh, okay, it's "noise," uh... "d-doors..." doors?
noise, doors...
Um...doors.
it's... Um...
it's... Wait.
guys, stop! - Wire.
Abby's signing construction noise, doors booby-trapped.
so, how we getting in, Eric?
okay, skylight, fire escape north side.
I'll leave, trip the door fuse remotely,
place will go kaboom, and the phantom remains traceless.
you're not traceless.
Oh, come on, Abby.
you know butane burns hot enough to destroy evidence.
you have my teeth marks in your finger.
creep.
Miami?
no, Miami was half the height, and we still got all busted up.
one of us may land soft enough and get the shot.
Yeah, if one of us is peter pan.
I saved the white-woman-in- her-late-20's slot for you.
guys!
you should be honored.
guys, gotta go now!
you've got to lay off the doughnuts, buddy.
you okay?
Yeah.
thank you, G. Callen.
you're welcome, Abby Sciuto.
Moines pd got a traffic-cam shot of Smith near the crime scene.
and tampa pd found him on a flight manifest, leaving after the murder.
you've solved 15 murders in as many hours, abby. How's that feel?
almost as good as being alive.
Hey, I lowered him down.
and you did it perfectly.
the post-incident medical evaluation is not optional, Abby.
they're waiting for you. Go, go.
Hetty, I'm so sorry, but there's something way more important that I have to do first.
what could possibly...?
Abby, on screen in 30 seconds.
that.
Gibbs, Gibbs, I'm okay!
I know you were coming to save me.
but these guys, they were amazing, really. I mean...
you should see what they can do with a fire hose.
McGee, you were so right about how cool this place is.
I mean, not as cool as home, bcause nothing's as cool as home.
and I can't wait to see you guys again.
it was scary and all, but we got him! We got the phantom!
amazing! I mean, really... - I wanna show you something.
Oh, I know there's a small fee. We're going to lend you some resources to search for evidence.
that smith was there around the time of the...
you're going to tell me that I should have consulted you - Before... - Nope.
my team's getting half a day's desk work done in half an hour.
you row pretty good.
Thanks.
detective hodges, special agent Kensi Blye, ncis.
you're beautiful.
two more?
you got it.
I want to see you.
Hey, hey, bad etiquette, Homes.
can't be touching the dancers.
Hey, look, guys, we... we don't want any problems tonight, okay?
I got no problems. - You got a problem?
all right, all right.
settle it down or take it outside, boys.
we got a zero tolerance for trouble in here.
how about a dance?
I'm done for tonight. Sorry.
dude, where's the beer? The natives are getting restless.
where you going? - I think I'm in love.
you want to grab a coffee or something?
it's late.
decaf?
listen...
look out!
I already sent the others upstairs.
good morning, Hetty.
well, that's a matter of perspective, Mr. Callen.
uh, I've been doing some accounting and I came across an anomaly in your expenses.
this is a $1, 400 restaurant bill from Matsuhisa.
that's from the Miyagomi case.
you mean it's not a mistake?
you actually spent $1, 400 on raw fish?
not me, my alias, Tony Z, did.
and is Tony Z going to reimburse me?
well, you'll have to talk to him about that.
Hetty, when I go undercover as a beach bum, I eat at the Kogi truck.
when I'm going after high rollers, I gotta hit it a little harder.
try ordering soup, playa.
I'll tell Tony that.
you do that.
so, what are we looking at?
this footage is from a gentlemen's club in Hollywood.
that's Petty Officer Mostel Renny.
the driver of the car and P. O. Renny were killed. The woman's still in the hospital.
it's tragic, but since when do we start investigating DUIs?
well, Renny was there last night with several other sailors.
all of whom are Crypto Language Technicians.
basically, the Navy's top secret geek squad.
any surveillance footage from inside the club?
no.
Oh, look, pervs don't like to be filmed.
the driver of the car was African-American, had no I. D.
probably left his wallet at home.
the car was stolen weeks ago.
eh, might be a coincidence.
maybe not.
I contacted the hospital. The young lady is well enough for questioning.
Sam, why don't you and Kensi take the accident scene?
crime scene.
DOM, find Renny's friends, see if they know anything.
and can I get the address for the hospital?
Hollywood Presbyterian on Vermont. Take Sunset.
and I'll need anything you can find out about the girl.
she's Ukrainian.
thank you.
Eric, problem?
um... no.
okay, we've got rubber in the street.
Yeah, no skid marks.
which means the driver didn't even try to stop.
and that parking lot is too small.
there's no way to accelerate that fast in this distance.
so, the driver probably left the lot, turned around, accelerated back, which means...
it means Hetty's right.
it's a crime scene.
yes?
my name's Callen.
I already spoke to the police.
I'm not a cop. I'm with the Department of Transport and Highway Safety.
did you know Petty Officer Renny?
no. Look, um, maybe you could come tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I'm very tired.
Really?
cause they told me that you, uh, you just woke up.
you're from the Ukraine?
Yes. - Whereabout?
small town, Pavlivka. No one's ever heard of it.
I know Pavlivka.
Yeah, I spent some time in Balaklauski a few years ago.
Really?
years ago, even locals weren't allowed to Balaklauski.
were you supposed to be there?
I was working on a big pothole problem that they were having.
how long you been in the U. S?
not long.
long enough for your visa to expire?
I'm applying for a student visa.
you're in school?
well, I'm applying for school, too.
Oh, yeah? Which one?
look, I'm not from Immigration.
I just want to know what happened in that bar last night.
a man in the club grabbed me.
the guy who drove the car was with him.
that sailor intervened, but the club owner and a bouncer stepped in before anything really happened.
Eric. - Still no I. D. on the driver but Forensics got a hit on a set of prints they pulled off the car window.
uh, the guy's name is Cesar "Chi Chi" Vargas.
he's had run-ins with I. C.E. and the DEA for smuggling everything from drugs to human cargo across the border.
I'm sending you his photo and arrest record now.
all right, copy Sam and Kensi. See if they can get anyone at the bar to make a positive I. D.
and find me a last known address.
have them meet me there.
was this the guy that grabbed you at the bar?
no.
you're sure? - Yes.
the man was older and, um... scruffier.
no, no, this guy was older.
and he was with the African-American guy who crashed the car.
they use a credit card? - Nah, I already checked.
sorry.
Thanks. - Yeah. Of course.
he knows more than he's telling us.
there's an alley out back. I'll take the front.
I'm going in, Sam.
go.
clear. - Clear.
place is locked up.
he must've been gone for a while.
that might be why it smells musty in here.
if I had a place on the beach like this, I wouldn't go anywhere.
he's clearly past his expiration date.
you found this guy in a fridge?
weird.
when they said NCIS was coming with a body, I kind of expected Nate.
well, Nate was busy, but, uh, he sends his regards.
Really?
he's so sweet.
you know, he works so much.
I wish whoever was in charge over there would just cut the guy some slack, you know?
Oh, right.
don't ignore the corpse. He's still in the room.
okay, uh, looks like he's been dead for at least two weeks.
the cold temperature slowed the decomposition, but it certainly didn't stop it.
cause of death?
best guess at this point, suffocation following blunt force trauma.
clean and quiet.
I'll know more once I open him up.
you two are welcome to stay and wait if you'd like.
I don't usually have an audience, but visitors are always welcome.
pretty cool, huh?
tempting. - But we'll pass.
okay. - Did you finish with the driver from the club accident?
Oh, another weird one.
he wasn't drunk. In fact, he didn't have any alcohol or drugs in his system.
nobody calling to claim the body?
Oh, not yet.
we haven't been able to I. D. him. Still running his prints and dental.
but this might help.
at first, I thought they were some sort of gang initiation.
looks like machete wounds.
last time I saw anything like this, I was in Rwanda.
do you guys know if Nate is seeing anyone?
cause, you know, I'm just wondering.
Renny's sailor buddies didn't see anything, although one of them said Renny was hitting on the dancer, Katya.
I ran the driver's prints through Immigration's refugee database.
I got a match-- Deng Oyat.
he's not African-American. He's African-African.
originally from Sudan, he was placed with a foster family in Toluca Lake three years ago.
he's one of the Lost Boys.
second Sudanese civil war left two million dead and around 25, 000 young men displaced or orphaned.
they became known as the Lost Boys of the Sudan.
ops, Agent Vaile.
lucky ones managed to get into the U. S. and other countries through humanitarian aid.
well, maybe his foster parents know who he was with last night.
that was Hollywood Presbyterian.
Katya Vitkoya just signed herself out.
looks like we'll paying her a house call, Dr. Hanna.
take Kensi.
I need to check something.
want to share?
if it pans out.
32 hours.
excuse me?
you had 32 hours overtime last week.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
it was a busy one.
were you planning on, uh, sailing around the world?
no, just been busy.
you know, working... Uh...
just a... a lot.
Yes, we established that back at the start of the conversation.
I don't determine the caseloads, Hetty.
no, but I do set the schedules, so start packing.
on Monday morning, you're on holiday for a week.
where am I supposed to go?
I'm not a travel agent.
what was that about? - I've been banished.
I think something's up with Hetty.
what the hell you think you're doing?
what you going?
pretty quick for an old man.
it's a joke. - Yeah, try again.
what's up, man?
come on now.
are you kidding me?
how does a stripper afford a place like this?
some of these strippers make six figures year.
Oh, really? - So I've heard.
going on a trip?
my sister is sick.
you don't have a sister.
and you should probably have stayed in the hospital.
does the name Deng Oyat mean anything to you? - No.
he's the guy who tried to kill you and Petty Officer Renny last night.
I'm sorry. I really have to go now.
I'm sorry, but you need to answer the question.
get down!
this is Nate.
he's a good listener.
thank you.
how you feeling?
fine.
well, that's the adrenaline pumping through your body.
and when it wears off in a little while, you're gonna start shaking.
might even feel like you're gonna throw up, but don't worry.
it's a natural reaction. You're, uh.
safe here.
who were those men at your house?
I've never seen them before.
you have any idea why anyone would want to hurt you?
no.
any ex-boyfriend...?
no.
this is the man who almost killed you outside the club.
you recognize him?
he might have been with the man who grabbed me in the club last night.
but I-I can't remember.
well, you suffered a concussion.
it's not uncommon for the events immediately preceding that sort of injury to be a little fuzzy.
you know, you should probably go back to the hospital.
no. - Do you want us to help you, Katya?
do you?
cause if we don't, you're probably going to end up dead, okay?
right now, we're your only friends.
and maybe this-this Dengere-- maybe he wasn't trying to kill Petty Officer Bronson.
maybe... he was trying to kill you.
Why? I don't even know him, okay? Or Bronson or any of them.
she's hard to read.
girl's been on her own a long time.
she's used to taking care of herself.
it's a defense mechanism.
you bury your identity to protect it.
okay.
well, she might have seen or heard something and not even know it.
any word on our gunmen?
no. Car had no plates, and Eric wasn't able to find the vehicle on any street or traffic cams.
perfect.
where the hell's Sam?
Thanks.
here.
thank you.
how'd you make out Saturday on your S.A.T.'s?
710 in math.
that's nice.
it's not math I'm worried about.
400, writing.
okay. Okay.
it's getting there.
I still remember the first time you took me to the sea.
the Gulf of Aden.
you were eight.
I'd never seen so much water.
the ocean made you feel safe.
only makes me feel small.
what makes you feel safe?
being around my friends.
I've already told you before that that youth center has a bad reputation for teaching radical views.
in this country, if I wear baggy clothes, I'm a hip-hop gangster.
at the youth center, I am just Mowadh.
you know this guy?
that's Deng.
is he in some sort of trouble?
trouble?
he's dead.
crashed a stolen car into some people last night.
I just saw him last week. Why would he do something like that?
he doesn't even have a driver's license.
he was with another man.
older, scruffy. Might be passing himself off as Hispanic.
you know him, don't you?
you know him?
I've seen him at the youth center, talking to Deng.
he gives religious lectures. His name is Safar.
what kind of religious lectures?
I don't know. I don't attend. I keep telling you.
I only go there to play basketball.
does Safar have a last name?
born in Algeria, raised in Libya.
Safar Jaddalah's file reads like a who's who of Islamic militant groups.
devils on horseback with guns
they've traded in their horses for SUVs and upgraded their weaponry.
so what's Safar doing in L.A.?
I doubt he's auditioning for American Idol.
recruiting alienated and impressionable young men, just like that group of Somalieens in Minneapolis.
takes them back, indoctrinates them, and gets them to fight his jihad.
well, maybe hired Cesar Vargas to smuggle him into the country?
he probably came in over the Mexican border,
passed himself off as a Mexican-American, and killed Vargasto tie up
what's a religious fundamentalist doing in a strip club?
the 9/11 hijackers did the same thing before their attacks.
well, last night's incident could have been a glitch in an even bigger plan, guys.
and Deng Oyat was prepared to die to protect it?
deng Oyat did what Safar ordered him to do.
DOM, alert Homeland Security, and brief rector Vance.
all right, I'll put Safar's face out there, talk to the other agencies and local law enforcement, see if they have anything.
Eric, find this guy.
how well does this kid Moe know Safar?
he doesn't. Knows of him.
and how you know the kid?
I brought him here.
from Sudan?
I was in Chad as part of the Pan Sahel Initiate.
we were called into Sudan to rescue some aid workers.
Moe's father was killed, and Moe was injured during a firefight.
I figured it was the least could do.
how's Katya?
scared, but tough.
she's clearly affected by you and Kensi saving her.
she's not accustomed to having people do anything for her.
she wants to go back to her house and get some of her things.
I told her I had to talk to you about it.
maybe you could go over there.
I thought you might need a few things.
you went back to my house? - Yeah.
wasn't sure what you'd want so I, uh... I brought a little bit of everything.
let go of me!
sit down!
you want to run, fine! I'll call my buddies at ICE.
I'll have you on plane to Kiev tonight.
what do you want from me?
the truth would be a good place to start.
your boss, Dallas... all these are his?
Yes.
and for the men who were shy night vision.
blackmail.
who?
anyone who might have something to hide or something that Dallas wanted.
know him?
Yes.
at the club? - Yes.
at your house?
dallas told us he was a very special VIP.
they called him a buyer.
I don't like where this is heading.
Dallas's girls compromise military personnel with access to classified information.
dallas then decides to sell that information.
and Safar buys it.
maybe to help plan a terrorist attack.
why would Safar have someone drive a car into Dallas's club?
somewhere along the line, the deal went sour.
we gotta get a look at Dallas's video collection.
search warrant?
no, Safar finds out the club's been raided, he's gone.
we'll never find out what he's up to until it's too late.
okay, so how do we get in?
her
Hello, there.
look here.
well, well, well.
hey baby...
stand by, G, she's on her way in.
how's Dallas reacting?
like his best girl just got back and he didn't expect her.
Katya said Dallas's hard drive is in a storage area off the kitchen.
camera access?
none we could hack into.
Hey, good luck.
just a little bit crowded in here, you know?
can Dallas see us?
well... I'm sure he's been watching us since I came over here.
all right, let's do this.
we are gonna have fun.
one for the VIP room.
give us a good show.
all right.
let 'em go through.
Yeah, she's coming through.
okay.
that's my girl.
got at least three cameras, Sam, possibly more.
we turn on the jammer, Dallas is not the only one who's gonna lose picture.
I'm gonna need about a 20-second burst to get me out the door only one and down the hall.
20-second burst, initiating now.
go!
nineteen... - Security card.
third door down on the left.
twelve...
seven...
he needs to be down the hall now.
six...
five... Four... Two... One... Zero.
Jammer's off.
tell me you're in the kitchen.
G, you reading me?
we got picture, no audio.
accessing computer now.
where is he?
everybody out! Out!
don't move! Don't move! - Kitchen's closed.
how's that for a lap dance?
you got a warrant to go into my place?
fisa warrant.
terrorism investigation.
I'm not a terrorist.
I'm a patriot.
is that why you fell out with Safar?
is that why he attacked your club?
all good questions... for my lawyer.
he's smug.
I hate smug.
guy thinks he's going to walk out of here.
is he gonna walk out of here?
it depends what's on those tapes.
there. Him. - Who's he?
I think he's a senator.
which one?
okay, well, maybe he's a congressman.
okay, another one for the maybe column.
what do we got?
um... at least a dozen identified, including two senators, the CEO of an aeronautical company, a former child star and four senior military officers.
and we are only a third of the way done.
Safar? - Not yet.
keep looking.
no, Eric, you don't need to keep looking.
this investigation is over.
they're shutting us down?
all evidence, physical and electronic, is to be sent to DOD.
what about Dallas?
we're under orders to release him immediately.
Hetty, we're putting together a good case here, okay? A big one.
Hetty Safar's up to something. We can't stop now.
this is coming from on high.
when I say "on high,
I mean those with the political venom to end the careers of each and every one of us, including Director Vance.
I can't believe this. All we need is a little more time.
I know. I know, I know.
if I may slip into the vernacular, it sucks.
but when you hear from me again in an hour or so, you will shut this down.
don't forget to release Mr. Dallas.
guys, you've got to see this.
fire it up on the big screen.
I don't think we want this up on the big screen.
so look what I found on Dallas's sleaziest home videos.
I'm guessing Safar's imam would not approve of that.
what's that?
it's Arac. It means "forbidden."
no, no, no-no-no. What's-what's that?
whatever it is, it can't be good for you.
dallas is an extortionist.
once he got these guys on the hook, there's no telling what information he got out of them
technology, money, secrets.
I mean, he was a clearinghouse for confidential information.
Safar must have known this.
he went to Dallas for something specific
weapons, intelligence... maybe both.
well, maybe as part of their deal, Dallas offered Safar a night with one of his girls, as a sign of good faith.
okay, it's disgusting, but perfectly probable.
so, Safar is being blackmailed like everybody else?
but why would Dallas blackmail Safar if they got a deal going?
dallas is a criminal, but he's not a traitor.
it's not like Safar could go to the police.
he could drive a car into the club.
well, that's an interesting theory, but Safar is a terrorist, he's not Miss America.
why would he care if anyone had a sex tape on him, despite the feculent content?
he's recruiting idealistic young men to fight a holy war in the name of Islam.
think that means for a devout Muslim on the road to martyrdom?
well, couldn't he just denounce it as fake?
publicly, sure.
I'm guessing if that got out, Safar's sleeping on Salman Rushdie's sofa.
so you think you can lure Safar out of hiding with this tape?
but you don't even know where to find him.
I need to get a message to Safar.
I know some of you listen to his teachings and know how to reach him.
a friend of mine has something he wants.
all the information he needs is right here.
all right? Just plug it in.
my friend's number's on it.
carry on, gentlemen.
beginning to think you weren't going to show up.
hope you brought cash, 'cause, uh, I don't take traveler's checks.
I am not paying you or Dallas or anyone.
is that what you came out here to tell me?
look, you know the deal, Safar.
either you pay me $50, 000 or your little sexcapade goes out on CNN,
not if you're dead.
kill me, the tape still goes out.
it won't matter.
by then, you, the girl and Dallas will all be dead, and I shall be forgiven.
that's your plan?
what, are you going to shoot me out here in broad daylight?
you won't even make it off the pier.
after I shoot you, I'm going to shoot that elderly man, then those children and several of the young women, before I have to reload.
by then, no one will be getting in my way.
point taken. All right, you know what?
let's... let's take a walk and let's talk about this in private, okay?
just leave them out of this.
the time for words is over.
gun!
don't move!
turn over!
get up!
I am but one in a legion of warriors.
true warriors don't use innocent kids to do their dirty work.
you are the friend of Mowadh.
the man who killed his father.
what?
who is using children now?
I'm not using anybody.
I gave Moe a new life.
and now, so have I.
what's that supposed to mean?
Sam, back off! - Sam, no!
Sam! Sam! Sam, no!
what's going on, man? Where are you going? Where are you going?
I got your message to Safar. What else do you want from me?
listen. Hold on. Hold on. Hold up.
I'm not letting you get on that van until you tell me where you're going.
you can't stop me.
wait a minute! Wait! Wait!
what are you going to do, huh?!
wait!
kill me like you killed my father?
is it true?
did you murder my father?
I was protecting innocent people.
your father was working with the Janjaweed.
everything you said to me is a lie.
no, no. Come here.
no. No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't... I didn't lie to you.
I didn't tell you everything because I wanted to protect you, man.
I know you're hurt, all right?
I'll tell you everything you want to know about me, about your father.
let's just go talk about this.
the time for words is over.
good-bye, Sam.
did Sam hear anything?
no.
what about the deal on Safar?
turned him over to the CIA.
they'll try to turn him into an asset, put him to work, find out what he was planning.
they also took the blackmail material.
do you think that will ever see the light of day?
not publicly.
but it will be put to use.
in the street it's called "blackmail." In government, it's "leverage."
well, speaking of leverage, Hetty told me I had to give in my case reports every Friday by 5: 00, and I was really counting on having the weekends to get caught up.
I'll talk to her.
awesome. Thank you.
you are my hero.
did you find Moe?
no. His foster family has no idea where he is.
youth center's claiming ignorance.
got a hit on Moe's passport.
he's on an A France flight to Paris.
what time's it leave?
left.
I'm sorry, by the time you told me to start looking, it was too late.
that's all right, Eric.
is Paris his final destination?
um, no.
he's on a connecting flight from Charles De Gaulle to N'Djamena, Chad.
from there, he'll probably try to slide across the border into Sudan.
why would he go back?
he's looking for answers.
keep tracking him.
Moe's father used to work with the Janjaweed.
I killed him.
does Moe know?
now he does.
so what are you going to do about it?
right now?
go for a run.
last time you said it, I had to drive out to Joshua Tree to pick you up.
I'll bring my cell phone with me.
what's up with Hetty?
you, too?
so is this another money-saving cutback or are you, uh, writing your tell-all Hollywood memoir?
it's a eulogy for an old friend.
I'm sorry.
this was his typewriter.
it seemed fitting, almost poetic, three hours ago.
now, it just seems like a lachrymose act of folly.
well, I can't help you there.
Lachrymose-intolerant.
you would have liked him.
he was the perfect combination of scholar, soldier, and scoundrel.
was he a romantic friend?
no. No, I'm afraid he was married... to his job.
he worked for the intelligence service in England.
never married, no children, but a stellar career.
he died alone his office, filling out paperwork.
something you'll never have to worry about.
is that why Nate's being forced into exile?
and what about you?
when was the last time you took a day off that wasn't caused by a bullet?
I don't want you waking up one morning, wondering if it was all worth it.
I'm sorry if I was... a tad strident today.
I just want to make sure that you all take the time to smell the roses.
how about Saturday?
there's a Rembrandt exhibit at the Norton Simon Museum.
I'll pick you up at 11: 00?
Rembrandt, Mr. Callen?
don't get too excited.
I just go there to meet chicks, so... Essentially, you'll be my wingman.
I relish the assignment.
if only it were true.
what about tonight?
I think I'm going for a run.
just tell me we're not running to Joshua Tree this time.
Nah.
Oh, bugger!
and it's another beautiful morning here in the southland.
clear and sunny skies with a high for the day of 78 degrees.
current temperature outside is a crisp 60.
still no traffic problems at this early hour.
clear cruising on most of the major freeways, but...
fourth and Spring? No problem.
you see that sunrise? - Yeah.
another day in paradise, right?
not a morning person? - Who is?
okay, okay. If you want my money, take it!
it's not your money I want.
help! Help!
help me!
I got it. Cowboy Bar on Sunset.
with the mechanical bull? - Yeah.
no, Hetty plus mechanical bull plus tequila equals bar fight.
trust me, I've been there-- Dom?
is that a doll?
uh, no.
it's... not a doll.
you're playing with an alien doll?
at work?
there is a difference between dolls and bobbleheads.
and Imperial Class Alpha Centauries are only part alien.
the other part is cyborg, I mean, everyone...
how about Disneyland? - I hate Disneyland.
Kensi hates Disneyland.
the happiest place on Earth?
I have issues with grown men in furry costumes.
unless it's Thursday night.
what are we talking about? - Quality time with the team.
apparently, it's been too long since we hung out, unless there's a corpse involved.
we're brainstorming ideas.
bowling. It's great competition, uh, builds camaraderie, and you get to wear those funny shoes.
no bowling. - No bowling.
okay, what about the Cowboy Bar on Sunset?
Oh, that sounds like fun.
they have a mechanical bull, Hetty.
Oh, no, never mind.
Mr. Callen, you've received an email this morning.
more specifically, Jason Tedrow received an email.
who's Jason Tedrow?
alias from an old case.
I don't remember it.
you were on assignment in Afghanistan.
a case that now involves all of us.
why is that?
because the man who sent you the email was killed two hours ago.
the cabbie's name was Joey Gale.
former navy systems technician.
how'd he end up driving a cab?
four years ago, we took Gale and his accomplices
gale was the inside guy.
Montrell Perez. He was the crew's leader.
sociopath with gang ties. Fourth Street Flats.
flats, rough boys. Tight knit.
no prior record. Bunked with Perez, who dragged him into it.
how'd you catch them? - Deep cover op.
I went in as Jason Tedrow, a dirty MP.
spent months getting close to them.
told them I knew they had taken the money and that I could use my connections to sabotage the investigation.
they believed me. I asked for a cut.
and on the day of the payoff, NCIS arrested all of us.
now, Gale and Donnelly struck up a deal to testify against Perez.
they each did four years and got released.
but Perez wasn't so lucky.
he's doing a ten-year stretch at the Naval Consolidated Brig at Miramar.
so, where does this crew think their buddy Tedrow ended up?
shipped off to a brig in South Carolina.
and the five million? - Gone.
gale used his access to transfer the money from the fund to an outside account.
but the money was gone from the outside account when the investigators got access.
gale and the rest of them passed lie detector tests.
they had no idea where that money went.
NCIS got the convictions that they wanted, but the five million dollars was never found.
which leads us back to the email Gale sent Jason Tedrow.
he found an account number.
now he wants Jason Tedrow's help getting it.
why get in touch with someone he hasn't seen for so long?
I'm just a naturally likeable guy.
or he was desperate.
could be a little bit of both.
gale connected the money to a shell corporation, but the account was closed approximately two hours ago, right around the time that this happened.
this is a traffic cam on the corner.
he tossed the murder weapon so he wouldn't be caught with it.
it wasn't a mugging; it was an execution.
someone knew he was getting close to the money.
Kensi, head down to the brig in Miramar. Find out what Perez knows.
and if Perez has ties to the Flats, then he's a suspect.
could've ordered the hit from prison.
all right, on my way.
Where's Jon Donnelly?
hmm, paroled three weeks ago, like Gale.
but no driver's license, no utility bills, no credit cards.
off the grid.
I'll find him.
how is our old friend Jason Tedrow?
it's just another alias, Hetty.
an alias that reminds me of something Theodore Roethke once wrote:
well, I've been a lot of people.
Yes, but you enjoyed being Jason Tedrow best.
it bothers me, too, Mr. Hanna.
keep an eye on him.
he's good at spotting tails.
and you're good at running them. Stay close.
lone wolf or not, Mr. Callen is one of our own.
Oh, my God.
been a while.
mom!
Jason, this is Michael. My son.
what is this? You think you can just waltz back into my life?
thought you'd be glad to see me.
you disappeared.
I was in prison.
that's not an excuse.
you didn't even say good-bye.
that would've made it harder. I didn't want you to have to deal with this, too.
the only person who decides what I am fit to deal with is me.
I've dealt with plenty.
and I'm doing just fine.
I'm looking for your brother.
Jon? He's still a lost cause. Figures you'd be looking for him.
Kristin? - In the kitchen.
Hey, big guy! - Come here!
how are you, kid?
Jason Tedrow, this is Tommy Boyd. My fiance?
nice to meet you.
likewise.
Jason's an old friend of Jon's.
he was just leaving.
you're getting married?
met him right after you vanished.
you thought I was just gonna wait for you?
no. No, I... I get it.
last I heard, Jon was hanging out in front of the Supply Depot in East L. A.
just looking to pick up odd jobs.
trying to make ends meet.
Thanks.
I've moved on. Please, don't come back.
you know, I spotted your tail a half mile into my drive.
if you spotted me, you would have tried to shake me.
it was that, uh, leapfrog maneuver on Olympic that gave you away.
you wish.
what?
you got involved with Jon Donnelly's sister during the case?
she was never a suspect or a witness, okay? It was deep cover.
I just used her to gain the trust of her brother's crew.
okay... So I got close to her.
she doesn't know my real name.
the man she fell in love with doesn't even exist.
what about the kid?
he was never a suspect, either, but he did seem a little shifty.
who's the kid's father?
I don't know.
user log in, please. - Thanks.
agent Blye, NCIS? - That's me.
lieutenant Commander Neil Corby, JAG.
Montrell Perez is my client.
And?
you're assuming I have conditions?
we arrested him. You defended him.
and our relationship is adversarial by nature.
I need something. You have it.
namely, the cooperation of my client.
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
easy now, Agent Blye. We just met.
what do you want?
I'm petitioning the Court of Appeals for a reduction in my client's sentence.
I'd appreciate the support of NCIS at the hearing.
I will see what I can do.
much obliged. So now...
here comes our boy.
agent Blye is prepared to help us get you out of here earlier than planned, Montrell.
all you have to do is answer some questions.
for this piece, I'll do it for free.
Joey Gale is dead.
and not from natural causes?
gunned down in the street this morning.
well, I hope it hurt.
I didn't do it.
Yeah, but you're tight with people who could.
ain't no crime to phone home.
what about Jon Donnelly? - Well, I hope he's next.
gale and Donnelly turned on me. Karma's a bitch.
Montrell. Please stop making yourself a suspect in this case. Knock it off.
I haven't had a visitor in a long time.
okay. We're done. - Let me try to work this out, man.
okay, okay, okay. Call me, huh?
I ain't going anywhere. Maybe we could go out on a date.
package for you... from a JAG lawyer. Corby?
you read the card. - Well, for security purposes.
you know, national security classified document protocol for...
Yeah, he doesn't really have clearance to know about this location.
well, he sent them through central NCIS mail dispatch in San Diego.
in record time. I hate flowers.
give him points for trying.
here we go. - I'll handle it.
this crowd can smell a cop a mile away.
I smell like a cop?
actually, you smell like baby powder, but that's a whole different conversation.
what?
you're scaring me.
I just want to talk.
God! Geez!
you trying to get yourself killed?
I'm trying to stop myself from getting killed!
you all right? - I heard about Gale. Thought maybe I was next.
haven't seen anyone run that fast since that time you got caught with that Marine's girlfriend in San Diego.
and the only reason I ran is because you broke the land speed record getting out of that bar after you realized he had buddies with him.
it's good to see you.
isn't this where you tell me I look good for a guy who did 48 months in the brig?
I'm a thief; I'm not a liar.
how'd you find me?
bet she was glad to see you.
well, not as much as I'd hoped.
look, I saw the report on Gale this morning...
and you heard it was a botched mugging, and you thought I killed him.
I didn't say that.
don't feel bad. I thought the same thing about you.
so the five million's still missing, isn't it?
I don't know anything about the money;
I just know I don't want to be looking over my shoulder the rest of my life.
you think Perez could have done this?
he's a sick bastard.
you know, when I was locked up, every time I talked to my sister, she made a point of asking if I'd heard from you.
broke her heart pretty bad.
I made a mistake.
you're damn right. And to make up for it, you're gonna call my little sister and apologize for all the things and...
this is the security cam from Jet Plastics.
no plates, guy in a mask.
no way to ID the driver.
gale and Donnelly are both dead.
that leaves Montrell Perez.
guy in the SUV didn't take a shot at Jason Tedrow. Why not?
Callen? You okay?
Jason Tedrow didn't show up as a player until the end.
gale and Donnelly knew more than me.
or he was trying to shoot you, too, and he missed.
well, Gale and Donnelly both testified against Perez in court.
he hated them for that.
thought you hated flowers.
pulled up everything on Kristin Donnelly's fiance, Tommy Boyd. And?
Phew. Skeletons in the closet.
five years at Folsom State Prison for armed robbery.
served his full sentence. Released in 2002.
anyone else think Kristin's got a thing for bad boys?
Hey, moving on.
Boyd's records show an incident where he was a minor.
uh, underage drinking and a DUI.
he was acquitted, but the details of the case were sealed by the court.
work with Eric, get it unsealed.
Kristin has no idea she's marrying an ex-con.
you don't know that. - I know her.
she'd never go down that path again.
it's not your place to look out for her. She's a part of this case.
Oh, and Boyd just drops into her life after I leave?
it could be a coincidence.
somebody dropped a hammer on Gale and Donnelly.
Perez making hits from prison-- it's a good theory.
it's not the only theory.
do you think it's Boyd? Or do you want it to be Boyd?
Sam, just as you said, I'll be okay.
what is this? - I was thinking Ping-Pong.
ping-pong.
more specifically, a Ping-Pong night.
Oh, yeah, for the team outing.
and not to brag or anything, but, uh, I'm really good.
fortunately for you, it's easy to pick up. Come on.
serve it up.
there you go.
how's the case? - Callen wants to work alone.
one of the fundamental tenets of G. Callen is to tackle things solo.
it's the way he makes sense of the world.
he's been doing it his whole life.
you debrief him after every case. You know what's not in the files.
and that's all you're gonna say? - That's all I can say.
if it affects NCIS, it's my job to speak up.
but as far as the innermost thoughts of the field agents are concerned, it's my job to make sure that they stay confidential.
he trusts you more than anyone else, Sam.
what if he doesn't need my help this time?
you'll be ready to offer it anyway.
what about the girl? Kristin Donnelly?
nothing he can't handle.
did I mention I have one of the sickest topspin serves you've ever seen?
no.
ready? - Sure.
free lesson? - Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I just got... I got to warm up next time.
cause I-I got... I have this, uh, this rotator cuff thing.
you ever get that? Like... when you're in the gym?
probably not.
beat your ass at Pictionary.
thank you, sir.
right this way, ma'am.
this isn't a social call. - How did you guess?
the flowers weren't nice enough to warrant a same day visit.
I hate flowers, but the gesture didn't go unnoticed.
what branch of NCIS are you with, anyway?
there's been another shooting.
jon Donnelly. And we think Montrell Perez may have had something to do with it.
may I ask why?
I can think of about five million reasons.
a less tactful attorney might suggest your efforts are better spent trying to locate this alleged hit man rather than assigning blame to a prisoner already serving his time.
Perez is a legitimate suspect.
and if you still want us to support his appeal, he needs to tell us everything he knows.
Oh, he told me he'd talk to you anytime.
so long as it's face-to-face.
and they say chivalry is dead.
just run it through my office first, okay?
of course. Thank you for the flowers.
you said you didn't like flowers.
I kind of like that you sent them.
what are you doing here?
Kristin doesn't know, does she? - Know what?
look, I was 18. I'm not the guy who pulled the trigger.
and it takes a hell of a lot more than talking like a cop to rattle me.
look, she'll leave me if she finds out.
she's had it with people who disappoint her.
how'd you meet?
at a bar. Look, what do you... what do you want from me?
I want you to convince me that you had nothing to do with Jon Donnelly's murder.
it's not an excuse; it's what happened.
but I served every day of my sentence.
we all make mistakes. - Yeah, we do.
but one mistake I'll never make is walking out on Kristin.
that's more than I can say for you...
whoever you are.
at least he didn't shoot you. - There is that.
you mind explaining how this visit is connected to our case?
is my partner interrogating me?
something's wrong with this guy. It's just...
he's got some demons.
don't we all?
he said he met Kristin in a bar, but it just feels like there's more to it.
then there probably is.
but he does seem to care about Kristin and the boy.
I don't know.
four years ago, walking away seemed like the right thing to do, but...
I told her so many lies.
the best thing you can do is find the man who killed her brother.
now, unfortunately, police can't make anything stick due to the fact that witnesses against Se or Icey tend to suffer from such maladies as unnatural strangulation, untimely dismemberment, and unfortunate spills down empty elevator shafts.
Hey, don't hate. I love my job.
question Perez again, but don't tell his lawyer.
let's see how he does without coaching.
go behind Corby's back?
Ooh. Intrigue. Betrayal. This is getting good.
sometimes he's so cheerful, I just want to punch him. Repeatedly.
since Corby said Perez will see you anytime, then he doesn't need to know.
have another sit-down, smile a lot, look like you're interested.
Oh, be still my beating heart. Another chance to hear the latest penitentiary pickup lines.
we dress you in something tight.
nice.
you put that on just for me?
sure, I did.
jon Donnelly was killed in a drive-by shooting this afternoon.
it's tragic.
you're the only one in that crew that isn't dead.
and you don't seem to be too scared about being next.
scared? Right. I'm a big dog in here.
untouchable.
to most.
do you like having me here?
then give me something I can use or I'm gone.
what do you want to know?
what happened to the money you stole?
off the record?
sure.
we stole five mil.
Four-point-five of which I never saw again.
what happened to the difference?
in a bank. Got my name on it.
I'm gonna tell you something I haven't told anybody before.
not even that JAG lawyer of mine, Corby.
four years ago, the night before the trial, I got a phone call.
guy on the other end of the line was wearing one of those voice distorter things.
he told me I was going down, but I could walk away with some cash if I did my time, kept my mouth shut.
do you have any idea who it might have been?
could have been any of a dozen guys who knew.
bunch of my old Flats boys.
maybe even this bent MP named Tedrow.
gale and Donnelly said they got calls, too.
they told the guy no. Thought they'd do their time, get out, find the money.
guess they were wrong.
is that all?
for today.
you think I'm coming back?
Yeah. I sure do.
it'll be like Silence of the Lambs, only you're hotter than the FBI chick...
and I'm a lot smarter than the creepy old killer guy.
call me.
our killer started working on his plan four years ago.
he spoke to Perez and the others before the trial. - "Call me," you see that?
sounds like he had inside information on the case. - Come on, they all like the bad boys, you know that.
Yep.
you promised you'd run all visits with Perez through me first.
Oh, I'm sorry.
someone must have screwed up at the office.
Munro, what is it with you, man?
you jealous?
I'm trying to kick it to this hot agent, man.
in your dreams. - No, you saw the way she touched my shoulder, man.
she... - Perez? Perez!
get a medic, now!
Kensi. Get back in there.
his pulse is fading fast. What happened?
he started choking and collapsed!
Perez! Perez, who was the man on the phone? Perez!
who took the money?
it's too late.
he's dead.
initial toxicology results indicate that Perez was poisoned.
sodium cyanide.
it's a colorless salt that induces cardiac arrest.
slip it into someone's food or drink, and it can take hours to kill them.
Hey, I got something on Kristin Donnelly's fiance?
remember that sealed case on Tommy Boyd's record?
the DUI he got as a minor.
Yeah. Well, I finally managed to access the court records and get it unsealed.
Tommy was acquitted due to a technicality.
his court-assigned lawyer discovered an error in the arrest paperwork and got the prosecutor to seal the case.
that's pretty good for a public defender.
Yeah.
it was Neil Corby.
Corby's a former navy petty officer.
after graduating law school, he went the public defender route for four years and then decided he was a military man at heart.
next stop was JAG.
Perez said he didn't tell anyone about the phone call.
but Corby knew about it.
so either Perez was lying to me
trying to make me feel special
or Corby knows more about this case than he's letting on.
I hate flowers.
you and Neil Corby... - And don't hold back.
what, you bring him along to lay a beating on me? Is that what this is?
he saved my ass on a DUI charge when I was 17; I owed him.
I kept in touch.
I mean, the way my life was headed, I-I figured I could use a lawyer who was a buddy, and four years ago, he...he called in the favor.
he wanted me to get close to a girl. - Kristin Donnelly.
the woman you supposedly met in a bar.
no, I did. He told me where she would be, and he sent me in.
Why? - To keep tabs on her brother, Jon.
apparently, he just got sent to prison, a-and Corby seemed to think that he might have known about some missing money, but as far as I could tell, Jon didn't know anything and neither did Kristin.
and you fell for her.
when she told me she was pregnant, I figured it was meant to be.
her and that boy, they're my family.
I mean, it doesn't matter how it started...
they're all I care about now.
is she in some kind of danger from Corby?
no. - Why should I believe you?
cause you're not the only one that cares about her.
Corby represented Perez in the trial.
he had inside information about what went down.
got to the money, switched it to another account.
then he got nervous that Donnelly might find out, so he hired Tommy Boyd to keep an eye on him.
but in the end, it was Joey Gale who put it all together.
we'd better talk to Kensi. - yeah
Thanks.
wow, thank you for meeting me.
I have to apologize.
I'm very sorry about Perez.
well, this isn't exactly the way I envisioned our first date, but...
the case has hit a dead end.
there was another guy who got arrested four years ago.
a crooked MP, Jason Tedrow.
Yeah, I read his name in the case file.
he just got released from Charleston.
all right, I'll check him out. - I already did.
several times.
every time I went to Charleston to visit one of my clients over the past four years,
I made it a point to try to meet him.
one time, the warden told me Tedrow was in the infirmary.
another time, Tedrow was on work duty.
he was even in solitary once.
with Jason Tedrow, it was always something. Man's like a ghost.
so, now that he's out, you can see why I've taken an interest.
Yes, certainly does sound suspicious.
it does.
I started considering all the possibilities with Tedrow, and I landed on this one.
there's this story, it's passed around the JAG guys.
NCIS has an undercover operator who can turn himself into anyone at any time for any reason.
gets his man, then he's gone.
like some urban legend. Doesn't even have a real name.
just... "Callen."
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of urban legends.
I know there was an undercover NCIS element involved in the case four years ago.
I think...Jason Tedrow and Callen are the same guy.
which means you are wearing a wire...
and he is listening to every word of this.
so, either he shows his face right now or I pull the trigger and leave you bleeding out all over that seat.
Tommy? - Why is Boyd here?
what the hell are you doing?
I followed you from your house.
I'm making sure you don't hurt Kristin.
she doesn't know where the money is.
turn around, walk away.
look, whatever favor I owed you is paid.
it's not that easy. - Yeah?
I figured you'd say that.
he's got a gun!
you want to shoot a federal agent, you go right ahead.
let her go!
get down!
okay, hang in there. I gotcha, hang in there. Hang in there.
you're okay, you're all right.
it's not that bad. You'll be okay. Come on.
ambulance is on the way.
that's him, isn't it?
I never heard of him.
I had to protect her.
you did.
I win, right?
I don't know this Jason Tedrow guy, but he's becoming a pain in my ass.
is he retired now?
almost.
good job. - Thanks.
congratulations are in order.
Jason Tedrow has officially ridden off into the sunset.
what about Kristin?
she has her son, Michael.
is there anything you don't know? - Plenty.
but whether such things are worth knowing, however, is debatable.
what do I do?
ask yourself a question.
which I is I?
then tell her the truth.
I'm certain she'll return the favor.
which truth?
the one that sets you free.
what are you drawing?
looks good.
I'm sorry for showing up. I just...
I probably should've called.
why start now?
how's Tommy?
doctors say he can come home tomorrow.
he's a good man.
Yes, he is.
Michael's not your son.
I should've told you the moment you came back, but I was so angry.
I wanted you to wonder.
I wanted you to suffer like I had after you left.
that was wrong.
one last thing, I...
my real name...
good-bye...
Bye.
we were waiting on you.
Why?
the team outing, remember?
dom made reservations.
do I even want to know what he chose?
I chose.
I hope you all enjoy karaoke as much as I do.
but if not, deal with it.
come on.
you don't have to.
and miss the opportunity to show up your pathetic Mick Jagger impersonation with my Springsteen?
not a chance. - You, Springsteen?
this I gotta hear.
Where's Dom?
I don't know, meeting us there, I guess.
I bet he doesn't show. Bet he's got himself a hot date instead.
guess he'll just have to hear you some other time, Hetty.
what are you going to sing?
I thought a little Ella Fitzgerald.
I've been told I sound just like her.
that's our program.
thanks for tuning in to "Jazz" on Starry Night...
sig Alert from earlier this evening...
you can't sing both parts of a duet.
says who? - Not in a competition.
that sounds like second place talking.
look, I was clearly the better performer last night.
you can ask Kensi, Hetty, Nate, Eric.
come on, man. They saw it with their own ears.
well, a table of impartial observers would beg to differ.
those women were seriously hammered.
and you let them vote.
Look,"To All the Girls I've Loved Before" is a karaoke classic.
I just made it my own, and my fans clearly appreciated the effort.
you held your nose during Willie Nelson's parts.
that was very original.
my Funny Valentine"? What, are you kidding me?
no, I-I hear that's in heavy rotation at the senior center.
it's a jazz standard.
well, just be glad you're not Nate.
Valentine.
is Hetty here yet? - Nope. But Backstreet's back.
is there any coffee? - Yeah.
Nate, friends do not let friends sing boy bands.
who has an extra pencil?
are you sure you're not still drunk?
maybe.
anyone know how long this, uh, seminar thing is supposed to go?
last year was six and a half hours before the first bathroom break.
Oh, my God.
has anyone seen Dom?
no, but that's one way to avoid a hangover-- don't show up for karaoke.
Yeah, don't show up for work.
30 seconds, he's going to be rookie meat.
your watch is slow, Mr. Callen.
Bravo!
Hetty, all right!
the crowd goes wild!
an inspired choice, Hetty.
well, there's no magic quite like the quixotic combination of the Messrs.
cognac and Bon Jovi.
but given our various states of post-inebriation,
I will waste no time in welcoming each and almost every one of you to our mandated annual workplace safety evaluation.
where is Mr. Vail?
I just called him, and it went straight to voice mail.
didn't get the memo.
maybe we should postpone this, until-until we're all here.
Oh, no. I'll prepare a makeup session especially for Dom.
have no fear, it will consume his entire weekend.
number two pencils.
the tools of ignorance.
let's open our books to page one and begin.
sorry. Off.
a safe work environment is not just a goal.
that's me. Sorry. Phasers on stun.
does the word,"vibrate" mean anything to you people?
if you're behind this, Mr. Beal...
what? It wasn't me. Pinky promise.
it's an Agent Needs Assistance alert.
it's coming from Dom's phone.
let's find him.
broadcast for 15 seconds, and then it stopped.
maybe he pocket-dialed it.
there's almost no chance that
Dom's specific four-digit sequence got entered accidentally.
and it would've had to happen twice.
the sender has to enter the same code to turn it off.
straight to voice mail, first ring.
so, the alert got turned off, and so did his phone.
turn it back on.
it's not responding. Battery's either dead or was taken out.
what about a GPS lock?
alert wasn't broadcast long enough. I can't get a position.
Dom's home phone is not answering, either.
what about the GPS in his car?
all right, I got it-- just south of downtown.
an alley off 18th and Santa Fe.
what the heck was Dom doing down here?
it's his usual shortcut-- he takes the alley to avoid the long light at Santa Fe.
Oh, my God.
hit me up, G.
Eric, check for traffic cameras in the alley, in this parking lot, anywhere nearby, okay?
see if there was anyone tailing Dom.
looking now.
uh, this is just how we found it about 45 minutes ago. No body.
ipod, cash, house keys, laptop still here.
this wasn't a robbery.
did anybody see anything?
no witnesses at all.
that's not surprising, though.
this part of town's no-man's-land till rush hour kicks in around 7: 00.
a guy stopped at a light on 18th called it in.
bullet holes have a raised edge from the outside.
shots came from inside the car.
there's a lot of blood and a lot of glass.
okay, so Dom comes through here.
he stops for some reason.
somebody sneaks up, smashes the driver's window.
second assailant smashes the passenger-side window, forces his way in, throws it in park, they struggle.
bang, bang, bang.
he's been here what, a few months?
what does he know about shortcuts?
yeah?
there are traffic cams at every intersection downtown.
near your alley, and in the parking lot, no video at all.
cameras everywhere on Dom's route but this spot.
was he taking this shortcut to and from work?
car's pointed east.
well, that means he was headed home.
well, in that case, this happened last night.
then, why did get an Agent Needs Assistance call this morning?
dom must have gotten his phone this morning, even if it was just for a second.
something went wrong when they took him.
bad guys got sidetracked somehow.
guys? Onboard camera was activated.
hard drive has a bullet hole in it, though.
techs might still be able to pull some footage off it.
you know what?
no one bleeds this much and survives.
ty, could you look at this?
Oh, poor little fella.
who'd want to shoot you?
you talk to your computer parts?
uh, do you talk to your plants when you water them?
just my orchids, but they can be tricky.
look, hard drives are like people, okay?
take one to the casing, and it's like getting shot in the butt.
hurts like hell, but probably not going to kill you.
but take one to the platter, like...
it's like getting shot through the heart.
wait. Is this from Dom's car?
Yeah.
he's supposed to bring in a cooling fan from an old G-4 tower today.
we're building a PC together. Rule is, spare parts only.
he's... a pretty good geek.
you know, for an agent.
just see what you can get off it.
as far as Dom's demeanor is concerned,
I noticed nothing unusual in the past few days.
what about his laptop?
from what we can tell, untouched.
that's not surprising. Dom's a stickler for security.
what about witnesses? - There's no witnesses, Hetty.
why did this happen?
I mean, why Dom?
right now, we have no idea.
okay. FBI, DEA and ICE
they've all called to offer their help. Work them.
cross-reference threats to their agents.
see if there have been any similar abductions.
do whatever you have to do to find him, by whatever means necessary.
you ever been here before?
no.
me, neither.
it's not unusual to wait a considerable period of time before visiting the residence of a colleague, okay?
okay.
dom went straight from college at MIT to NCIS training at FLET-C to us.
guy in a hurry to get his life started.
you know, he told me he was so excited to come to L. A.
that he didn't even stop at his folks' place to pick up his stuff.
we really never got to know him.
Nate? Don't go there.
I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean like that.
so, who calls to tell them that he's missing?
maybe the director, maybe Hetty.
I never had to make one of those calls before.
he didn't come home last night.
why two monitors?
uh... Internet, game console.
dom tapped into the parking garage security system.
building's got cameras.
all his e-mails ran through the secure server at NCIS.
there's nothing suspicious here.
I mean, no indication that he thought anyone was targeting him.
what about his personal stuff? Open up his browser, go through his history.
you want to do this?
Oh, it's gadget blogs, news sites, tech reviews.
and he doesn't even clear his cache.
we don't all need private browsing.
he hasn't been around long enough to make enemies, Sam.
so, what are you saying, it was random?
maybe. I mean, bad things happen in this town.
wrong place, wrong time? Come on, G.
he's a kid. Driving down an alley in a bad part of town.
it's as good as anything else we got.
which is a lot of nothing.
you know as well as I do, no one gets snatched up for nothing.
we got something.
so, we've got three cameras in the parking garage, all Internet enabled.
four digit password, eminently hackable.
well, how far can you go back?
so, we've got one, two, three angles, and here's Dom's car coming and going lots of times.
when's this from?
um, last week.
and that one?
yesterday. Why?
put 'em both on screen for me, side by side.
new camera.
and it's mounted right above Dom's parking spot.
Where's the footage from that camera?
there-there isn't any. It's not connected to the building's system.
but if that camera's new, the other camera should have footage of who put it up.
that's not Dom.
it's from two days ago.
his shoulders are hunched, tense.
his body language definitely suggests he's conscious of being watched.
the installer knew other cameras were there.
his face is hidden intentionally.
why not disable the other cameras if you're worried about being seen?
you shut down three video feeds, someone from the office is gonna come down and check.
okay, see that antenna?
the new camera's wireless.
it's designed to be monitored from a laptop nearby.
all right, well, the image isn't clear, but is this photo grab good enough to run through facial recognition?
doubt it. - Do it anyway.
you and me set up on a target to run surveillance, how long?
I don't know. Two, three weeks to chart a guy's habits, patterns.
minimum.
dom gets snatched up two days after that camera gets installed?
all right, so it all came together quickly. W-What is your point?
pros are deliberate.
whoever did this was obviously professional.
why would they break operational security?
well, maybe they paid a premium to get this done quickly.
why Dom?
he's a rookie.
he's never been with any agency other than NCIS.
you said it for yourself. He wasn't on the job long enough to make any enemies.
maybe it's not about Dom.
maybe it's about us.
we've got enemies.
lots of 'em.
so maybe somebody wants to send us a message.
Dom's the easiest one to grab.
I told him. Change your routes, vary your timetables, stay alert for tails.
Sam, what were you gonna do?
you-you were gonna pick him up in the morning, drop him off at the end of the night?
he was the new agent. We were supposed to watch out for him, G.
Dom's phone just came back on.
audio and video from Dom's phone.
waiting on the GPS lock.
looks like a hand.
come on, Eric. Where is he?
triangulating. It's north.
maybe in the Valley?
no, still north.
Santa Clarita?
private residence, Valencia.
tell Kensi to meet us in the car.
clear.
clear.
clear.
clear.
clear.
clear.
no Dom.
we're too late.
it's like a makeshift hospital in here.
I hate hospitals.
no I. D.
shocking.
whoever put this in hit the vein on the first try.
it was a pro. A doctor, a nurse.
Yeah, whoever it was-- they tried pretty damn hard to save him.
not hard enough.
this is Dom's phone.
why leave the phone behind?
why not?
took the battery out so we couldn't track it.
okay, so this guy comes to, sees the phone, drags himself across the carpet.
make one last call.
incomplete.
Yeah.
but he activated the GPS for us.
this IV's got a serial number on it.
here.
Eric, it's coming to you.
run it through facial recognition.
every available database.
these guys try to take Dom, he fights back, one of them gets shot.
buddies brought him out here to fix him up, but he lost too much blood.
IV, bandages, morphine.
leaving the phone behind.
they didn't leave him here to die.
wait.
if Dom wounded him before being abducted, it could mean that the blood we found in the car wasn't Dom's.
I like the sound of that.
let's get it tested.
keep hope alive.
Yeah.
news, Eric?
bad and good. No luck on facial recognition for Mr. Valencia, and Ty couldn't pull any video off the hard drive from Dom's car.
too much damage to the platter.
that's bad and bad.
well, there's no video, but I managed to salvage the audio.
here goes.
grab his arm. Grab his arm.
I can't hold him. My gun.
that's it.
I should have called and made him come with us.
but, you know, he never wanted to drive with me.
said I took too long to get ready.
you listen.
guilt is the strongest emotion, the most powerful emotion we exhibit.
it's so easy to feel and it's impossible to dismiss.
it's also a strong motivator, but it tends to cloud our judgment.
I'm talking from experience.
agent Sullivan?
Oh, God, I don't know how many days I second-guessed myself after we lost him.
remember that you are a strong woman.
sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?
Yeah. Sometimes.
but don't think for a minute that they can do it without us.
it's time to follow this through.
guys, we got a hit.
we got a match on the dead Latino dude.
Frederico Gomez, Colombian national.
here come his vitals.
crap, they're all in Spanish.
wanted on multiple charges:
cross-reference for any known associates named "Rafael.
the name screamed in Dom's car.
rafael Taro. Has a brother, Jose.
let me guess-- the Taro brothers make a power trio.
big time.
looks like the Taro brothers and Frederico were involved in a number of abductions in South America, mostly businessmen snatched for ransom.
that says "hermana. " They have a sister.
Yep. Emigrated to the U. S. seven years ago.
she's a nurse at Valencia Hospital.
closest hospital to where you found Frederico Gomez's body.
I hate hospitals.
serial numbers from the IV bag trace back to a shipment made to Valencia Hospital.
I hacked into the hospital personnel database.
their firewall might as well be made of Swiss cheese from the hospital cafeteria.
please tell me Claudia lives nearby.
better. She's a critical care nurse. Works today.
let's go.
she doesn't show up for her shift. Where the hell is she?
maybe she never left home. Eric will have the address.
I'll call him.
you running, that means you have something to hide.
that right, Claudia?
Where's our friend?
I don't know!
I want a lawyer.
you don't need a lawyer, Claudia. You need a magician.
it's pretty much the only chance you have of making your fingerprints disappear from the vials of morphine we found at the scene.
Frederico was hurt bad.
he-he needed to go to the hospital.
but your brothers wouldn't allow that, would they?
I knew he wasn't going to make it.
but I thought if I just helped them this-this one time...
Oh, maybe that'd be it?
that you'd never have to see them again.
I never had anything to do withheir business.
I came to L. A. to-to get away from them, but they don't care.
I'm still their little sister. They-they want me back home.
what did they say? - Nothing.
only about a package they had to deliver.
that package is an NCIS agent.
a package that has a family and a name, Claudia.
who, unlike your brothers, has something to contribute to this world!
you okay? - Fine.
you saw him, didn't you? Claudia?
what did they do with our friend?
you had a choice what to become when you came here, and you became a nurse.
now, I'm guessing that's 'cause you wanted to help people.
you wanted to make up for things.
things that maybe your brothers did that you had nothing to do with.
our friend helps people, too.
people like you and those that you take care of.
to keep them safe from people like your brothers.
they brought him in with Frederico.
he'd been shot, but it was a minor flesh wound.
I patched him up.
when they left, they took him with them.
that's all I know.
how did they contact you?
on my cell.
what time?
around 10: 00 p. m.
Eric! - Give me the love.
okay. 213-555-7862.
running it now.
Oh, so not feeling the love. It's a burn phone. No GPS.
the best I can do is get you the nearest cell site.
all right, the call came from the Alameda Corridor.
near the L. A. River.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
too much ground.
if I'd only ridden him harder.
if you'd ridden him any harder, he may have washed out.
either way, this wouldn't have happened.
maybe. Maybe not.
I don't know how you keep a lid on your feelings.
I just focus on the case.
it's not natural, G.
neither is that.
why you choose to live in this area is yet another Callen mystery.
well, the atmosphere stimulates my brain.
yeah? Mine's about to explode.
so, LAPD sent the description of Dom and the Taros to all their units in the area.
nothing yet.
well, with all the gangs and the street crime they're dealing with,
I wouldn't hold your breath.
informants won't be of any use.
taros came up for this job special.
they're not going to have any criminal connections locally.
at least not on the street level.
even if we find out where they're keeping him, chances are we have to shoot our way in.
you know the odds of a hostage surviving in a raid like that?
let's call them. - And say what?
please tell us where you are and give us our friend back alive?
something like that.
a swap.
family ties are strong.
they might just take the risk.
just got to get Claudia on board.
hmm. Yeah.
you're asking me to betray my family.
we're asking you to do a good thing.
we're asking you to help us save our friend.
if someone was at your hospital, someone hurt really bad, who witnessed a crime committed by your brothers, would you help them or would you let them die to save your brothers from jail?
please.
Frederico's dead.
your sister is alive... for now.
who is this? - Doesn't matter.
let me talk to her.
here's the deal, Raffie.
you want to see your sister back home safe and sound, you meet me in two hours at the intersection...
No! We do this my way or we don't do this at all.
I'm waiting, Raffie.
there's an abandoned hospital on Soto, south of Ninth.
there's a boiler room in the southeast corner.
be there in one hour!
thank you.
thank you. Pizza Hut.
it was a community hospital that shut down five years ago.
it's been vacant ever since.
the boiler room is in the basement.
it's 50 feet across, ceiling's 25 high.
Accessibility?
one door on the ground floor, which is where you will enter.
there's a staircase that leads you to the boiler room floor below.
to the north, there's a hallway that leads to the basement.
now, the building is six stories high and three stories below ground.
a warren of corridors and rooms.
lots of places to hide. - Lots.
visibility?
dwp readings indicate minimal activity.
my guess would be a few low wattage maintenance fixtures.
windows? - A series of ten-foot-high industrials on the east side.
there might be just enough illumination from the moonlight to make out figures, but not much else.
their turf. Their staging. Their lighting.
and a little over 30 minutes.
not good. - Very not good.
what we need is a satellite.
with high-resolution optical stabilizers and infrared.
I'll make a phone call.
is there anything else?
uh, luck.
a little luck.
I'll see what I can do.
Kensi, we're going to need Claudia.
in position, Eric. Which way in?
all right. Satellite's online.
I have one heat signature inside the boiler room.
only one?
it's a huge complex.
three subterranean layers, lots of concrete, protective shields in X-ray rooms.
dom could be anywhere.
and so could the other Taro brother.
I'm going in.
I'm here.
come down.
steps.
Where's my friend?
someplace safe. Keep coming.
where are you?
move to the far end of the room.
stop.
I delivered my part. Where's my friend?
someplace safe.
let her go, or he's not going to be safe much longer.
Sam, I have another heat signature west of the boiler room.
it's weak. Possibly hostile, probably subterranean.
okay. Which way in?
the-the courtyard. There's... there's a bathroom window.
it's... it's the fifth window in.
he's not going to get to Jose in time.
he'll make it.
come on, now.
Sam, he just turned east.
there's no way east. There's only a stairway down.
heat signatures don't show elevation.
he-he could've gone down to go east. Take it!
Eric, where is he?
he should be right there. He's ten feet away.
I've got nothing.
he must be on a different level.
wherever he is, he's headed for the boiler room.
take the hallway to your right. Go fast!
he's on the move, Sam, headed north.
you're not getting anything till I see my buddy.
why is that heat signature stronger than the other one?
it's not stronger by much, but...
but it could be closer to the satellite, which means that he could be...
Sam, he's right above Callen.
put the gun down.
put it down!
go! Go!
take off the hood.
buy me a little time, G.
I didn't think you'd be bringing Claudia.
what are you, FBI? You LAPD?
NCIS.
I just want to know what name to put on the tombstone.
diversion in three, two, one.
cover me.
where is he, Raffie? Where is he?
I want a deal.
what do you want, Raffie?
nothing for me.
for Claudia.
you don't take her in.
you don't put nothing on her record.
you never even met her.
you have my word. She walks.
your friend is in San Bernardino.
hook Creek Road.
there's a blue van.
we took the money.
we left him inside.
why did they want him?
I... I don't know.
I never saw them.
I... I never met them.
go.
at the end of the day, we all deal with things in our own way, don't we?
good night, Mr. Callen.
miss
today, we're with ATF agents as they prepare to infiltrate a group of suspected gun runners.
going after criminals is one thing, but going after those who deal in weapons practically guarantees a violent confrontation.
these agents have no idea just how much firepower they're going to have to go up against.
everything from machine guns to grenades and even rocket launchers have been used against them.
agents have breached the door and are storming inside.
ATF Agents! No one move!
I'm not hearing any shots fired, so that means they're going from room to room right now, looking for guns and perps.
all clear!
that's us. Let's go.
alpha Team all clear. Building's secure.
copy that, Alpha Team.
we're gonna need a forensic unit in here.
copy.
they're already dead.
my God, they're already dead.
cut it.
I said cut it.
what the hell happened here?
Oh, morning, Hetty.
where is everybody?
upstairs waiting to be briefed on a case.
waiting for who? - For you.
Oh, okay.
but first, you owe me some paperwork.
Oh, I already dropped that report off.
everyone received a list of potential new recruits, and everyone has returned his recommendation but you.
we don't need a new recruit.
dom is missing, not dead.
I'm not trying to replace Agent Vail.
I'm trying to give the team the support it needs until his return.
this isn't an office job, Hetty.
we don't need a temp.
you're right, this isn't an office job.
I'll get to it when I have a chance.
thank you. - You're welcome.
have a good day.
I will.
now, you want me to go upstairs or not?
I'm sorry I had bothered you with this.
you're not bothering me.
my mistake.
uh, my experience has been that your need to get in the last word is a sign of annoyance.
Ah, she found you.
she always does.
Yeah.
go ahead, Eric.
night before last, the reality TV show On The Line!
was following ATF agents on a raid of suspected gun runners when they found this five dead, no obvious signs of death.
two in Marine uniforms, uniforms are authentic, the men are not.
they're not Marines?
not even close.
both guys are career criminals.
I know that guy.
Ian Albers. Small-time con.
we bust him before?
Nope, not according to his record.
maybe one of those militia guys we rounded up in the bush a few months back?
no. I remember the guys I bust.
but I've met him somewhere.
then if these guys aren't real Marines, it isn't our problem.
LAPD should be handling it. - They are.
looking military IDs, and what the hell they were up to.
he wants assurances that the security of our bases has not been compromised.
what is this place?
Eric said it was registered to a La Grange Enterprises.
turns out it was a bogus company.
well, it's a lab, but they weren't making meth.
not with what they have here.
so what were they cooking?
I don't know.
maybe something that killed them.
well, a drug overdose would show up on an autopsy.
so would a communicable disease.
fumes of some sort?
which brings me back to my first question:
what were they making and where is it?
someone cleaned this place out.
someone who didn't get killed.
what was with the Marine uniforms?
you know, feel free to chime in here anytime.
looks like those men weren't the only ones who died here.
yeah? - Hey, Callen, it's Kensi.
Eric and I have been sifting through the electronic records of the dead men.
we found a vector between a recurring phone number and GPS activity of one of their vehicles.
you have an address?
Yeah, it's, uh...
299 North Sierra Bonita.
owner's name is Balmore.
all right, great. Have a HazMat team come out here and sweep this place.
hazmat?
Callen, what did you guys find?
I don't know.
well, if you and Sam have been exposed to something, the medical officer has to take a look at you.
your health could be at risk.
you know what? So could yours if you keep eating the breakfast burritos.
how...
how did you, um...
the cheese-- makes your voice phlegmy.
not good.
good-bye.
got 13 birds, two squirrels.
what are the chances these guys were cooking up some sort of biochemical weapon?
I sure as hell hope not.
because if they were, then we've been exposed to it.
it's a nice neighborhood.
I hate to see small-time cons hanging out around here.
Yeah, small-time cons aren't running this operation, whatever it is.
the lawn could use a rake.
what a mess.
Mrs. Balmore?
I'm just all butterfingers today.
I just have to clean this up.
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.
special Agent G. Callen.
NCIS.
could we ask you a few questions?
well, of course, dear.
but I need to clean this up.
it was full of sugar water for the hummingbirds.
so, if I don't hose it off right now, it's going to be like Leiningen versus the Ants back here.
let me help you with that. - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Mrs. Balmore, Hmm?
uh, do you recognize these men?
I know Corporal Ames.
Oh, and that's Corporal Bishop.
they're my Marine Corps drivers.
where did they drive you?
the research facility.
I wasn't supposed to say that.
it's classified.
national security.
you can tell us. We're...we're NCIS.
Oh, you are?
Yeah.
how's your research going?
very well.
I thought I would be rusty after all of these years, but I was able to isolate several grams of Clostridium botulinum last week.
botulism? - Mm.
most dangerous toxin known to man.
would either of you gentlemen like some lemonade?
I never wanted to be an army wife, but I was in love with my husband.
there you go. - Oh, you're so kind.
thank you, Steve.
it was Sam, ma'am.
you're welcome.
I'm so sorry.
sometimes I think I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached.
it's fine. It's okay.
so, you enlisted and wound up working in the army's medical unit?
Yes.
now, that was an old boys' network back then.
that was so nice of Steve to bring tea.
are you married?
no. No.
um, let's talk about...
a handsome, young man like yourself?
I work a lot.
that was Kensi.
the coroner has confirmed it was botulinum poisoning.
director Vance, Homeland Security and CDC have all been alerted, along with local medical services.
and HazMat's doing a sweep of Esther's place.
who knows what else Granny was cooking up there.
should Nate be wearing a mask? - No, he's safe.
you don't catch botulism from other people, but we might have been exposed because we were in the lab.
you feeling okay?
Yeah, nothing a couple weeks of vacation can't cure.
I hear that.
you're very tall.
my husband Marty was tall.
he died of a heart attack at Santa Anita several years ago.
he loved the ponies.
let's talk about your work at Fort Detrick in the late '60s.
bacterial purification.
the work we did revolutionized the production of antibiotics and other drugs.
and what about your most recent work?
Oh, well, I'm long retired.
and your research at the lab?
lab?
where your two drivers took you?
Oh, yes.
I forgot about that.
I helped them isolate proteins.
a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium C.
Botulinum?
Yes, of course. That's it.
thank you for reminding me.
why did they need the botulinum toxin?
antidote research.
so our boys in uniform will be safe.
she seems like just a sweet old lady.
she is a sweet old lady.
someone tricked her into creating biochemical weapons.
would you excuse me a moment?
Oh, I think she's delightful and, um, extremely dangerous.
she's suffering from Alzheimer's.
she remembers the 60s and 70s in vivid detail, but has memory lapses about more recent events.
all right, well, it is one thing to forget to feed your dog;
it's another when you forget security protocols when you're dealing with bioweapons.
she may be responsible for those men's deaths.
or...
the person behind this used what she created to tie up the loose ends.
and if that's the case, she could be in danger.
botulinum is a neurotoxin protein.
very popular in Hollywood, where it is known as Botox.
kills the muscles that cause wrinkles for that "Don't I look 20 even though I'm 50?" look.
it can also paralyze your breathing muscles, and you suffocate to death.
in fact, it is the deadliest substance known to man.
so, the housewives of Beverly Hills should be classified as biochemical weapons.
do you guys know what LD50 is?
it's the median lethal dose:
the amount of toxin needed to kill half the people exposed.
lower the LD50, the more dangerous the substance.
exactly.
now, the botulinum toxin has the lowest LD50 there is.
so, a samplenly is small could kill up to a quarr million people.
and if what Esther tolus is accurate, then she isolated enough to kilten times that.
she's like the evil Martha Stewart.
only she's not evil.
she's vulnerable because of her Alzimer's, and whoever's behind this knew that.
they must have sight her out and tricked her into thinking that her expertise was needed for national security.
ye, she's an easy mark but an unreliable witness.
poor thing.
she must have enjoyed the company and attention.
now, the real question is, who's behind this, and where the hell is the toxin?
Oh, we may have a lead.
member this guy, Ian Albers?
I've been trying to.
well, he used to be a bouncer at Club Halo for our old pal, Dallas.
I knew I recognized him.
maybe he's moved on from blackmai to dealing in bioweapons.
you think Dallas is behind this?
if he is, he's going to wish he wasn't.
dallas closed the Halo Club after the Shafar incident.
he's been keeping a low profile since.
apparently, not low enough.
the dude's already proved he has friends in high places.
and low places.
he's going to call his DC buddies to shut us down, just like last time.
he's not going to cooperate.
at least not willing.
and get this.
supposedly, he replaced his security with a bunch of retired East German Secret Police.
the latest Hollywood accessory, a special operational staff security team.
Hetty, any suggestions on getting Dalla?
Yes. I suggest don't have this conversation.
forget diamonds in this business, plausible deniability is a girl's best friend.
now...
sit down and say,"Ah."
Hetty, honestly, I'm fine.
asset protection is part of my responsibility, and you are an asset.
when you're noting a pain in the asset.
now, open wide.
Ah.
Ah.
what was that for?
it's a health nervous reflex.
it's the fit thing to go in botulinum poisoning.
stop laughing. You're next.
dallas hid his electronic footprint pretty well.
he was hard to find.
for the record, I walked away 30 seconds before.
well, he always was careful.
last time, we had to go to his club just to look at his computer.
Yeah, but he didn't hide his credit cards.
at least not well enough to hide them from Eric.
apparently, the crime syndicate is recession-proof.
five days a week, Daas has been getting massages at a place called the Ahimsa Retreat.
what is that?
a wonderful day spa.
they have the best foot-care packages.
it's like seeing your toes to heaven.
I'm not through with either of your evaluations.
Hetty, we're both fine.
we really need to move on this.
well, then, you'll just have to make it quick.
you look good in a robe.
I look good in anything.
ready? - Yeah.
what the hell? - Relax.
don't be so tense.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
what are you...Come on.
what, are you stupid, Dallas?
you think this is a random robby?
you're butt naked.
I have friends.
lots and lots of friends.
right now, all you have a gun pointed at your head.
what do you want?
I want infortion on biochemical weapons, specifically botulinum toxin.
Oh, come on, I'm not involved...
I didn't ask you if you were involved.
I said want information.
now, you got two seconds to come clean, or I guarantee this massage won't have a happy ending.
I don't mess with that crap.
but there's a guy.
they call him the Dutchman.
supposedly, he's made some; now he's selling.
that's all I know-- I swear to God.
God don't like when you swear to him.
and I don't like to be lied to.
now, if I have to come back here...
if I find out you played me,
I'm going to shiatsu your ass into dog food you hear?
make sure you drink plenty of water.
stay facing down.
ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Dutchman.
aka Jacobus Troyger, Aka Sebastian Boon,
aka Juen Vanderveer, Aka yada yada yada.
the guy's got more alias than Callen.
somehow, I doubt that.
european terrorist.
technically, he's an arm dealer.
he sells weapons to radicals and insurgents.
therefore, he's a terrorist.
and he's in L Angeles.
I haven't been able to find any record on him entering the country.
well, he probably gave us an alias that wasn't on our watch list, and then entered through a port which doesn't have a facial recognition system in place.
if he's staying to sell his bioweapon, there's a good chance people are coming to buy it.
I'll check with Homeland Security and Border Control.
I'll contact Interpol, see if they picked up any chatter or tracked any movement overseas.
Eric, check e flight manifests, port surveillance.
we might just get lucky.
Mr. Callen, a moment.
if she puts on her rubber gloves, run.
but I draw the line at turning my head and coughing.
I'm going to pretend you didn't say that.
Now,Ice, how is our elder bioweaponeer, Esther Balmore?
getting her medical evaluation.
Oh, good.
that was first.
what's second?
Oh, uh, your partner.
Sam has been reluctant to weigh in on the selections for a temporary agent.
Sam doesn't play well with others, and he doesn't like to share his toys.
but times like these only emphasize the void left by the absence of Agent Vail, however temporary.
Sam is eternal hopeful that Dom is going to return to his post.
Sam sees the glass as half full.
I see it as half empty.
that's why we make a good team.
Kensi, on the other hand, just drinks right out of the bottle.
Nate wonders why it has to be a glass, and Eric usually breaks the glass putting cross feet up on the table.
nevertheless, I want his input, if only to begin to move him forward.
maybe you could give him a little nudge.
big guy does not like to be nudged.
I'll be gentle. - Thank you.
tell me something good.
Sam was right.
Interpol has various persons of interest who were stopped boarding planes bound for L. A.,in Berlin, London and Madrid.
we put LAX on full alert.
and we got a suspect.
He'a Filipino militant with ties Abu Sayyaf.
also kown as Alarakat AlIslamiy, or Islamic Movement.
they've been waging a bloody campaign of kidnappings, bombings and assassination in their fight for an independent Muslim state in the Philippes.
call Ice-- hold Amputuan for questioning, and have Nate meet us at the boathse.
I don't know any Dutchman.
okay.
you realize you're on a terrorist watch list, Mr. Amputuan?
there are many Amputuans in the Philippines.
you must be mistaking me for someone else.
I've heard there are well over a million people on those watch lists.
it must be easy to make mistakes.
what about your involvement with the militant group, Abu Sayyaf?
again, I'm afraid you have the wrong information.
I run a business call center.
Oh, great.
he'not just a terrorist, he's telemarketer.
that's almost worse.
I don't appreciate your racial profiling.
this isn't about race, Mr. Amputuan.
it's about terrorism, like your involvement with the 2004 SuperFerry bombing, killing 116 people.
that was a tragedy that had nothing whatsoever to do with me.
clock's ticking, Nate.
time to turn up the heat.
please.
okay, here's a deal, Simon.
uh, the Duhman was arrested this morning, and he started naming names.
but I told you I don't know him - Really?
because if you didn't know the guy, then you would've at least been curious to see who I was talking about.
sorry. Too late.
so, you're either going to coopate and work with, or you're going to get fingered by Jacobus or whatever name you know him by.
I would feel better if I was provided with legal counsel from here on in, just so as to ensure there are no, uh, misunderstandings.
fortunately for us, you're an unlawful combatant.
unfortunately, the boys at Guantanamo Bay have no vacancy.
so much for that sunny Cabbean getaway.
we do know some Mossad agents that would gladly buy you an all-expense-paid trip to Tel Aviv.
can you say,"Shalom"?
okay.
there is a rumor that the Dutchman is auctioning off the botulinum toxin.
where?
I don't know
you've come a lot way to not know where you're going.
uh, I didn't say I was here for the auction.
I said I heard rumors of it.
I also heard a rendezvous point.
I imagine it could be some place where a would-be bidder could be picked up and take to the proceedings.
you ever meet the Dutchman?
no. I told you...
Yeah. You know what? We got it.
we want an address, we want code words, and we want everyting else you've heard rumors about.
what if the Dutchman's seen pictures of Amputuan?
he must have screened these guys.
I'll go in as his muscle.
I'm gonna review the files, learn the history, his associates. Know it could.
I don't like this.
I don't, either, but the auction's today.
we don't have time to plan anything else.
besides, I'm the only one who's been vaccinate for botulism.
seals are inoculated for everhing, except suicidal tendencies.
and he knows I'm right, or else he'd argue to go instead of me.
I don't want either of you to go.
Nate, relax.
Sam's the best man for this job.
besides, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.
uh, Sam gets made, they ill him.
then you, Kensi and the others storm the place, and the Dutchman reases the toxin, killing all of you and half of Los Angeles?
what half?
I'm going to go brief the director.
you have had your shots, right?
Yeah, I had a shot.
annual booster
I'm gonna go suit up.
the vest is tight.
it's rubbing.
well, better chafed than dead, I say.
the camer is right here.
they'll probably sweep you, so the electronic we're providing you with can be remotely activated and deactivated so as not to be detected, all right?
Eric, let's give it a try.
turning Sam now.
scary.
they'll take your phone and any gun, so I'm providing you with this.
it's a ballistics briefcase.
it'll stop mostullets.
inside are $3 million in marked bearer bonds.
and twist, pull...
and voil?
a ceramiblade.
that's ?
no, uh, you know parachute or shark repellent?
I put that in your shoes.
botulinum protocols?
ingest it or inlet it, you die.
get it in an open wound, you die.
let's hope the vaccine works
I almost forgot.
in here is an ampule of the experimental antidote.
click for the needle.
if you're exposed, use it just for good measure.
Callen and the rest of us will be running around you the entire time.
keep it loose.
Noelicopters.
these guys will be paranoid.
you're not ready?
you take longer to get dressed than Kensi.
I have been ready for five minutes.
let's do it.
Sam looks like he's getting impatient.
he is.
and in about ten seconds, he's gonna complain about it.
they're late.
all you guys know each other pretty well, huh?
Oh, we should.
we've been together longer than most married couples in this town.
you worried about him?
right now, I'm worried out all of us.
Yeah.
what if Amputuan lied?
HollywooBoulevard?
I'm sorry I'm not from around here.
where are you from?
lots of places.
what's your name?
none of your business.
he was grabbed at the airpor
all I got your pardon?
I go through. I'm authorized to negotiate on his behalf.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
I have $3 million in bearer bonds that says your boss does
excuse me.
think he bought it?
we'll find out soon.
follow me, please.
I'm so sorry for the hood, Mister...
that's him.
that's the seller, Jacobus Troyger, the Dutchman.
just one more little security protocol.
blondie patted me down pretty good back there.
what do they say during those American football broadcasts?
any recording of his game without the NFL's consent is prohibited.
same courtesy applies here.
okay.
cut his equipment.
let's hope we can get him back again.
he's good.
thank you.
please.
LAPD, AT and HazMat are en route.
Rendezvo is at 7th and Santa Fe.
nolan, you coordinate with SWAT.
I want them in position, but stay out of sight until they see us go in.
Morris... - Yeah?
you got HazMat. They got to be right on our heels.
I don't need anyone else dying from this, okay?
start on the rear pemeter, move forward.
all right, let's go.
Eric, what's it looking like in here?
well, without Sam's feed, we're blind.
turn him back on.
Troyger must be employing a jamming device.
I can enhance this late, but for the live option, this is it.
he look familiar to you?
you're gonna have turn a little more, Sam.
that's it.
my, my. Benno Dragovic.
supplies Serbian mercenaries worldwide.
there are a lot of people in Washington who will want to see at we've stumbd upon here.
we're not seeing any cars come in, Sam.
you think the gang's in here?
looks like this party's starting.
what kind of firepower we talking about, Sam?
you ever see The Dirty Dozen?
a dozen?
you ready?
let's it.
tracking.
all teams moving into position.
welcome.
in 1969, when the U. S. Army stopped making biochemical weapons, they were more advanced than they mitted publicly.
I have recruited an army scientist that remembers the recipes.
on over today
botulinum thats highly flexible.
it can be vaporized against troops on the battle field.
or you can spread it on buets, and even a flesh wound becomes thal.
abu Nassim, the old warhorse.
he's not on Troyger's list of known associates.
Oh, sure he is.
abu Nassim isn't a name.
it's an honorific, from a culture where older people are revered with marks of respect.
his name is Sadiki Hassan.
he's on there, Your Honor Lady Lange.
this party favor is a vaccine to the botulinum.
uncle Sam would never let you have this.
hope we don't need it.
now get in position.
now.
you should all know the value of what you are buying.
and as many of you will resell in your various markets,
I thoght a demonstration would add value.
what kind of demonsttion?
the kind that makes international warns.
the mall.
is there a more representative place of American consumerism?
within the hour, an assocte of mine will deploy just a few micrograms of the botulinum, cut with a vaporizing powder that will carry it throughout the mall.
what mall?
I can't tell what we're looking at.
where is that?
here, in Los Aeles.
but don't worry, Mr. Cook.
you are safe here. - Yeah?
what if I go to do a little shopping before I go home?
is that the Hollywood Town Center?
or is it the Sunset Avenue Mall?
let's just concentrate on the shopping in here first, shall we?
assault turnes back to covert positions.
Eric, Kensi and I will take the Hollywd Town Center.
sent agents over to Sunset.
and HazMa teams to both places.
I'm already on it.
I don't want to scare Troyger.
nobody makes a move on the warehouse till we find this guy the mall.
big guy, I got some bad news.
you're going to have to stall for a while.
now, as you all know, the startinf price will begin at $1 million.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
but I'm concerned about your donstration.
we still have to bring this stuff out of the country a whole bunch of people g killed in a biochemical attack, they're going to lock the whole city.
you would rather pay several million dollars for something at, as far as you know, could be rushed aspirin?
does anyone else share Mr. Cook's concerns?
apparently, you are the only one who seems to be bothered by this, Mr. Cook.
and why is that?
I just want to do this smart.
seriously, Jacobus, are we here to buy weapons or for you to perverse on me because if these pants come off, I want a discount.
a big discount. You know what I'm saying?
all I know is that you are a very stupid man.
I'm stupid?
at least I don't have these two in the same room together.
Dragovic there killed, uh, Hassan's boy.
don't listen to him.
chechnya, 2002 Hassan's boy is over there, you know, paying his jihadi dues, and Drago was running black ops for, uh, Putin.
code name: Crusar.
you still haven't done me the courtesy.
I'm a ghost.
put your hands behind your back and shut up!
stay where you are!
I'm not seeing anyone from the file of known associates at either place.
nobody acting like they're about to kill hundreds of people.
any luck there, Hetty?
working on it.
I can't do this.
I mean, all those people and it's my fault.
Esther, try not to think about why.
Let's-let's pretend that we are looking for old frnds.
our friend that we're looking for would be right there.
now, who do you know?
listen to you using the objective exact properly.
Oh, look!
that's Captain Hogue!
there with the backpack.
Hollywood Townenter.
Eric, could you go back to the last feed?
Callen, level six.
Tallaucasian male, 30s, bald, yellow backpack.
can't see him.
guys, he's forcing himself to walk casually, but he's clearly trying to hide an adrenaline surge.
this guy is moments away from deploying.
I got him. He's heading for the food court.
Hey! I'm gonna just take this for a second.
thank you.
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
everybody, down!
everybody, down!
keep the vial in the water!
keep it out of the air.
we stay right here till HazMat scrubs us.
you know I hate needles!
it's the antidote, G.
I just saved your life.
I didn't get a warning?
Oh, now I got to warn you to save your life?
just keep the vial in the water!
that's why I like my job.
okay, got it.
the FBI's doing the press conference announcing the arrests of Troyger and the others.
and stealing our credit?
that was all us.
Sam and you and me.
right.
but we don't exist.
that's why you like your job, because we don't exist.
I like my job because I never have to do press conferences.
well, it's true you do have a better face for radio.
ms. Blye, if you touch that thermostat, it'll be to turn it down.
but I'm cold and Callen was pushed in a fountain today.
which is exactly why we need costcutting.
the koi fish in that fountain went belly up from the botulinum.
Oh, dear, one so rarely uses that phrase literally.
poor things.
anyway, the mall has billed us $72, 000.
for fish?! - Yes.
do you know what I could buy with that?
I have a pretty good idea.
apparently they're a prized lineage of Taisho Sanke from Japan.
the dead fish will be here in the morning so I can see them for myself.
what?
I know the difference between koi carp and crap.
all done.
my psychological evaluation of Esther Balmore.
and my strong recommendation that she shouldn't be charged.
she thought she was serving her country.
she won't be charged.
well...that's not all.
she needs, um, someone to adjust her medications, uh, consistent to nursing...
Yeah.
I'll take care of it.
you've come to offer to call the ADA for Esther Balmore, because...
you think watching an old lady go batty has set off a nerve in me.
I came for a cup of tea because I'm cold.
you know, in nursing homes, they only have tea in ba.
so, it just tastes like paper.
when the time comes, I'll bring you the good stuff.
smuggle it in if I have to.
whatever you need.
you know...
it's not the loneliness I fear.
but you are scared of something.
Yes.
filling everything I know.
all my secrets being blathered out into a world that should never hear them.
So,"when the time comes," as you put it, there's something you can do.
you can smother me with a pillow.
make sure it's synthetic.
I'm allergic to feathers.
okay.
Oh, the birds will be so happy!
the delivery man just left them out front, and I just couldn't move them.
you are so kind, Steve.
that's not it.
what is it, dear?
I'm Sam.
right.
uh, say, Sam. - Yes?
this stone fountain.
don't you think it would look better if it was over there?
sure.
piece of cake, Esther.
Oh, careful, Steve!
I'm Gage Jenson and this is On The Line!
today, we're with ATF agents as they prepare to infiltrate a group of suspected gun runners.
going after criminals is one thing, but going after those who deal in weapons practically guarantees a violent confrontation.
these agents have no idea just how much firepower they're going to have to go up against.
everything from machine guns to grenades and even rocket launchers have been used against them.
agents have breached the door and are storming inside.
ATF Agents! No one move!
I'm not hearing any shots fired, so that means they're going from room to room right now, looking for guns and perps.
all clear!
that's us. Let's go.
alpha Team all clear. Building's secure.
copy that, Alpha Team.
we're gonna need a forensic unit in here.
copy.
they're already dead.
my God, they're already dead.
cut it.
I said cut it.
what the hell happened here?
Oh, morning, Hetty.
where is everybody?
upstairs waiting to be briefed on a case.
waiting for who? - For you.
Oh, okay.
but first, you owe me some paperwork.
Oh, I already dropped that report off.
everyone received a list of potential new recruits, and everyone has returned his recommendation but you.
we don't need a new recruit.
dom is missing, not dead.
I'm not trying to replace Agent Vail.
I'm trying to give the team the support it needs until his return.
this isn't an office job, Hetty.
we don't need a temp.
you're right, this isn't an office job.
I'll get to it when I have a chance.
thank you. - You're welcome.
have a good day.
I will.
now, you want me to go upstairs or not?
I'm sorry I had bothered you with this.
you're not bothering me.
my mistake.
uh, my experience has been that your need to get in the last word is a sign of annoyance.
Ah, she found you.
she always does.
Yeah.
go ahead, Eric.
night before last, the reality TV show On The Line!
was following ATF agents on a raid of suspected gun runners when they found this five dead, no obvious signs of death.
two in Marine uniforms, uniforms are authentic, the men are not.
they're not Marines?
not even close.
both guys are career criminals.
I know that guy.
Ian Albers. Small-time con.
we bust him before?
Nope, not according to his record.
maybe one of those militia guys we rounded up in the bush a few months back?
no. I remember the guys I bust.
but I've met him somewhere.
then if these guys aren't real Marines, it isn't our problem.
LAPD should be handling it. - They are.
looking military IDs, and what the hell they were up to.
he wants assurances that the security of our bases has not been compromised.
what is this place?
Eric said it was registered to a La Grange Enterprises.
turns out it was a bogus company.
well, it's a lab, but they weren't making meth.
not with what they have here.
so what were they cooking?
I don't know.
maybe something that killed them.
well, a drug overdose would show up on an autopsy.
so would a communicable disease.
fumes of some sort?
which brings me back to my first question:
what were they making and where is it?
someone cleaned this place out.
someone who didn't get killed.
what was with the Marine uniforms?
you know, feel free to chime in here anytime.
looks like those men weren't the only ones who died here.
yeah? - Hey, Callen, it's Kensi.
Eric and I have been sifting through the electronic records of the dead men.
we found a vector between a recurring phone number and GPS activity of one of their vehicles.
you have an address?
Yeah, it's, uh...
299 North Sierra Bonita.
owner's name is Balmore.
all right, great. Have a HazMat team come out here and sweep this place.
hazmat?
Callen, what did you guys find?
I don't know.
well, if you and Sam have been exposed to something, the medical officer has to take a look at you.
your health could be at risk.
you know what? So could yours if you keep eating the breakfast burritos.
how...
how did you, um...
the cheese-- makes your voice phlegmy.
not good.
good-bye.
got 13 birds, two squirrels.
what are the chances these guys were cooking up some sort of biochemical weapon?
I sure as hell hope not.
because if they were, then we've been exposed to it.
it's a nice neighborhood.
I hate to see small-time cons hanging out around here.
Yeah, small-time cons aren't running this operation, whatever it is.
the lawn could use a rake.
what a mess.
Mrs. Balmore?
I'm just all butterfingers today.
I just have to clean this up.
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.
special Agent G. Callen.
NCIS.
could we ask you a few questions?
well, of course, dear.
but I need to clean this up.
it was full of sugar water for the hummingbirds.
so, if I don't hose it off right now, it's going to be like Leiningen versus the Ants back here.
let me help you with that. - Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Mrs. Balmore, Hmm?
uh, do you recognize these men?
I know Corporal Ames.
Oh, and that's Corporal Bishop.
they're my Marine Corps drivers.
where did they drive you?
the research facility.
I wasn't supposed to say that.
it's classified.
national security.
you can tell us. We're...we're NCIS.
Oh, you are?
Yeah.
how's your research going?
very well.
I thought I would be rusty after all of these years, but I was able to isolate several grams of Clostridium botulinum last week.
botulism? - Mm.
most dangerous toxin known to man.
would either of you gentlemen like some lemonade?
I never wanted to be an army wife, but I was in love with my husband.
there you go. - Oh, you're so kind.
thank you, Steve.
it was Sam, madam.
you're welcome.
I'm so sorry.
sometimes I think I'd forget my head if it wasn't attached.
it's fine. It's okay.
so, you enlisted and wound up working in the army's medical unit?
Yes.
now, that was an old boys' network back then.
that was so nice of Steve to bring tea.
are you married?
no. No.
um, let's talk about...
a handsome, young man like yourself?
I work a lot.
that was Kensi.
the coroner has confirmed it was botulinum poisoning.
director Vance, Homeland Security and CDC have all been alerted, along with local medical services.
and HazMat's doing a sweep of Esther's place.
who knows what else Granny was cooking up there.
should Nate be wearing a mask? - No, he's safe.
you don't catch botulism from other people, but we might have been exposed because we were in the lab.
you feeling okay?
Yeah, nothing a couple weeks of vacation can't cure.
I hear that.
you're very tall.
my husband Marty was tall.
he died of a heart attack at Santa Anita several years ago.
he loved the ponies.
let's talk about your work at Fort Detrick in the late '60s.
bacterial purification.
the work we did revolutionized the production of antibiotics and other drugs.
and what about your most recent work?
Oh, well, I'm long retired.
and your research at the lab?
lab?
where your two drivers took you?
Oh, yes.
I forgot about that.
I helped them isolate proteins.
a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium C.
Botulinum?
Yes, of course. That's it.
thank you for reminding me.
why did they need the botulinum toxin?
antidote research.
so our boys in uniform will be safe.
she seems like just a sweet old lady.
she is a sweet old lady.
someone tricked her into creating biochemical weapons.
would you excuse me a moment?
Oh, I think she's delightful and, um, extremely dangerous.
she's suffering from Alzheimer's.
she remembers the 60s and 70s in vivid detail, but has memory lapses about more recent events.
all right, well, it is one thing to forget to feed your dog;
it's another when you forget security protocols when you're dealing with bioweapons.
she may be responsible for those men's deaths.
or...
the person behind this used what she created to tie up the loose ends.
and if that's the case, she could be in danger.
botulinum is a neurotoxin protein.
very popular in Hollywood, where it is known as Botox.
kills the muscles that cause wrinkles for that "Don't I look 20 even though I'm 50?" look.
it can also paralyze your breathing muscles, and you suffocate to death.
in fact, it is the deadliest substance known to man.
so, the housewives of Beverly Hills should be classified as biochemical weapons.
do you guys know what LD50 is?
it's the median lethal dose:
the amount of toxin needed to kill half the people exposed.
lower the LD50, the more dangerous the substance.
exactly.
now, the botulinum toxin has the lowest LD50 there is.
so, a samplenly is small could kill up to a quarr million people.
and if what Esther tolus is accurate, then she isolated enough to kilten times that.
she's like the evil Martha Stewart.
only she's not evil.
she's vulnerable because of her Alzimer's, and whoever's behind this knew that.
they must have sight her out and tricked her into thinking that her expertise was needed for national security.
ye, she's an easy mark but an unreliable witness.
poor thing.
she must have enjoyed the company and attention.
now, the real question is, who's behind this, and where the hell is the toxin?
Oh, we may have a lead.
member this guy, Ian Albers?
I've been trying to.
well, he used to be a bouncer at Club Halo for our old pal, Dallas.
I knew I recognized him.
maybe he's moved on from blackmai to dealing in bioweapons.
you think Dallas is behind this?
if he is, he's going to wish he wasn't.
dallas closed the Halo Club after the Shafar incident.
he's been keeping a low profile since.
apparently, not low enough.
the dude's already proved he has friends in high places.
and low places.
he's going to call his DC buddies to shut us down, just like last time.
he's not going to cooperate.
at least not willing.
and get this.
supposedly, he replaced his security with a bunch of retired East German Secret Police.
the latest Hollywood accessory, a special operational staff security team.
Hetty, any suggestions on getting Dalla?
Yes. I suggest don't have this conversation.
forget diamonds in this business, plausible deniability is a girl's best friend.
now...
sit down and say,"Ah."
Hetty, honestly, I'm fine.
asset protection is part of my responsibility, and you are an asset.
when you're noting a pain in the asset.
now, open wide.
Ah.
Ah.
what was that for?
it's a health nervous reflex.
it's the fit thing to go in botulinum poisoning.
stop laughing. You're next.
dallas hid his electronic footprint pretty well.
he was hard to find.
for the record, I walked away 30 seconds before.
well, he always was careful.
last time, we had to go to his club just to look at his computer.
Yeah, but he didn't hide his credit cards.
at least not well enough to hide them from Eric.
apparently, the crime syndicate is recession-proof.
five days a week, Daas has been getting massages at a place called the Ahimsa Retreat.
what is that?
a wonderful day spa.
they have the best foot-care packages.
it's like seeing your toes to heaven.
I'm not through with either of your evaluations.
Hetty, we're both fine.
we really need to move on this.
well, then, you'll just have to make it quick.
you look good in a robe.
I look good in anything.
ready? - Yeah.
what the hell? - Relax.
don't be so tense.
you have no idea who you're dealing with.
what are you...Come on.
what, are you stupid, Dallas?
you think this is a random robby?
you're butt naked.
I have friends.
lots and lots of friends.
right now, all you have a gun pointed at your head.
what do you want?
I want infortion on biochemical weapons, specifically botulinum toxin.
Oh, come on, I'm not involved...
I didn't ask you if you were involved.
I said want information.
now, you got two seconds to come clean, or I guarantee this massage won't have a happy ending.
I don't mess with that crap.
but there's a guy.
they call him the Dutchman.
supposedly, he's made some; now he's selling.
that's all I know-- I swear to God.
God don't like when you swear to him.
and I don't like to be lied to.
now, if I have to come back here...
if I find out you played me,
I'm going to shiatsu your ass into dog food you hear?
make sure you drink plenty of water.
stay facing down.
ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Dutchman.
aka Jacobus Troyger, Aka Sebastian Boon,
aka Juen Vanderveer, Aka yada yada yada.
the guy's got more alias than Callen.
somehow, I doubt that.
european terrorist.
technically, he's an arm dealer.
he sells weapons to radicals and insurgents.
therefore, he's a terrorist.
and he's in L Angeles.
I haven't been able to find any record on him entering the country.
well, he probably gave us an alias that wasn't on our watch list, and then entered through a port which doesn't have a facial recognition system in place.
if he's staying to sell his bioweapon, there's a good chance people are coming to buy it.
I'll check with Homeland Security and Border Control.
I'll contact Interpol, see if they picked up any chatter or tracked any movement overseas.
Eric, check e flight manifests, port surveillance.
we might just get lucky.
Mr. Callen, a moment.
if she puts on her rubber gloves, run.
but I draw the line at turning my head and coughing.
I'm going to pretend you didn't say that.
Now,Ice, how is our elder bioweaponeer, Esther Balmore?
getting her medical evaluation.
Oh, good.
that was first.
what's second?
Oh, uh, your partner.
Sam has been reluctant to weigh in on the selections for a temporary agent.
Sam doesn't play well with others, and he doesn't like to share his toys.
but times like these only emphasize the void left by the absence of Agent Vail, however temporary.
Sam is eternal hopeful that Dom is going to return to his post.
Sam sees the glass as half full.
I see it as half empty.
that's why we make a good team.
Kensi, on the other hand, just drinks right out of the bottle.
Nate wonders why it has to be a glass, and Eric usually breaks the glass putting cross feet up on the table.
nevertheless, I want his input, if only to begin to move him forward.
maybe you could give him a little nudge.
big guy does not like to be nudged.
I'll be gentle. - Thank you.
tell me something good.
Sam was right.
Interpol has various persons of interest who were stopped boarding planes bound for L. A.,in Berlin, London and Madrid.
we put LAX on full alert.
and we got a suspect.
He'a Filipino militant with ties Abu Sayyaf.
also kown as Alarakat AlIslamiy, or Islamic Movement.
they've been waging a bloody campaign of kidnappings, bombings and assassination in their fight for an independent Muslim state in the Philippes.
call Ice-- hold Amputuan for questioning, and have Nate meet us at the boathse.
I don't know any Dutchman.
okay.
you realize you're on a terrorist watch list, Mr. Amputuan?
there are many Amputuans in the Philippines.
you must be mistaking me for someone else.
I've heard there are well over a million people on those watch lists.
it must be easy to make mistakes.
what about your involvement with the militant group, Abu Sayyaf?
again, I'm afraid you have the wrong information.
I run a business call center.
Oh, great.
he'not just a terrorist, he's telemarketer.
that's almost worse.
I don't appreciate your racial profiling.
this isn't about race, Mr. Amputuan.
it's about terrorism, like your involvement with the 2004 SuperFerry bombing, killing 116 people.
that was a tragedy that had nothing whatsoever to do with me.
clock's ticking, Nate.
time to turn up the heat.
please.
okay, here's a deal, Simon.
uh, the Duhman was arrested this morning, and he started naming names.
but I told you I don't know him - Really?
because if you didn't know the guy, then you would've at least been curious to see who I was talking about.
sorry. Too late.
so, you're either going to coopate and work with, or you're going to get fingered by Jacobus or whatever name you know him by.
I would feel better if I was provided with legal counsel from here on in, just so as to ensure there are no, uh, misunderstandings.
fortunately for us, you're an unlawful combatant.
unfortunately, the boys at Guantanamo Bay have no vacancy.
so much for that sunny Cabbean getaway.
we do know some Mossad agents that would gladly buy you an all-expense-paid trip to Tel Aviv.
can you say,"Shalom"?
okay.
there is a rumor that the Dutchman is auctioning off the botulinum toxin.
where?
I don't know
you've come a lot way to not know where you're going.
uh, I didn't say I was here for the auction.
I said I heard rumors of it.
I also heard a rendezvous point.
I imagine it could be some place where a would-be bidder could be picked up and take to the proceedings.
you ever meet the Dutchman?
no. I told you...
Yeah. You know what? We got it.
we want an address, we want code words, and we want everyting else you've heard rumors about.
what if the Dutchman's seen pictures of Amputuan?
he must have screened these guys.
I'll go in as his muscle.
I'm gonna review the files, learn the history, his associates. Know it could.
I don't like this.
I don't, either, but the auction's today.
we don't have time to plan anything else.
besides, I'm the only one who's been vaccinate for botulism.
seals are inoculated for everhing, except suicidal tendencies.
and he knows I'm right, or else he'd argue to go instead of me.
I don't want either of you to go.
Nate, relax.
Sam's the best man for this job.
besides, what's the worst thing that could happen?
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.
uh, Sam gets made, they ill him.
then you, Kensi and the others storm the place, and the Dutchman reases the toxin, killing all of you and half of Los Angeles?
what half?
I'm going to go brief the director.
you have had your shots, right?
Yeah, I had a shot.
annual booster
I'm gonna go suit up.
the vest is tight.
it's rubbing.
well, better chafed than dead, I say.
the camer is right here.
they'll probably sweep you, so the electronic we're providing you with can be remotely activated and deactivated so as not to be detected, all right?
Eric, let's give it a try.
turning Sam now.
scary.
they'll take your phone and any gun, so I'm providing you with this.
it's a ballistics briefcase.
it'll stop mostullets.
inside are $3 million in marked bearer bonds.
and twist, pull...
and voil?
a ceramiblade.
that's ?
no, uh, you know parachute or shark repellent?
I put that in your shoes.
botulinum protocols?
ingest it or inlet it, you die.
get it in an open wound, you die.
let's hope the vaccine works
I almost forgot.
in here is an ampule of the experimental antidote.
click for the needle.
if you're exposed, use it just for good measure.
Callen and the rest of us will be running around you the entire time.
keep it loose.
Noelicopters.
these guys will be paranoid.
you're not ready?
you take longer to get dressed than Kensi.
I have been ready for five minutes.
let's do it.
Sam looks like he's getting impatient.
he is.
and in about ten seconds, he's gonna complain about it.
they're late.
all you guys know each other pretty well, huh?
Oh, we should.
we've been together longer than most married couples in this town.
you worried about him?
right now, I'm worried out all of us.
Yeah.
what if Amputuan lied?
HollywooBoulevard?
I'm sorry I'm not from around here.
where are you from?
lots of places.
what's your name?
none of your business.
he was grabbed at the airpor
all I got your pardon?
I go through. I'm authorized to negotiate on his behalf.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
I have $3 million in bearer bonds that says your boss does
excuse me.
think he bought it?
we'll find out soon.
follow me, please.
I'm so sorry for the hood, Mister...
that's him.
that's the seller, Jacobus Troyger, the Dutchman.
just one more little security protocol.
blondie patted me down pretty good back there.
what do they say during those American football broadcasts?
any recording of his game without the NFL's consent is prohibited.
same courtesy applies here.
okay.
cut his equipment.
let's hope we can get him back again.
he's good.
thank you.
please.
LAPD, AT and HazMat are en route.
Rendezvo is at 7th and Santa Fe.
nolan, you coordinate with SWAT.
I want them in position, but stay out of sight until they see us go in.
Morris... - Yeah?
you got HazMat. They got to be right on our heels.
I don't need anyone else dying from this, okay?
start on the rear pemeter, move forward.
all right, let's go.
Eric, what's it looking like in here?
well, without Sam's feed, we're blind.
turn him back on.
Troyger must be employing a jamming device.
I can enhance this late, but for the live option, this is it.
he look familiar to you?
you're gonna have turn a little more, Sam.
that's it.
my, my. Benno Dragovic.
supplies Serbian mercenaries worldwide.
there are a lot of people in Washington who will want to see at we've stumbd upon here.
we're not seeing any cars come in, Sam.
you think the gang's in here?
looks like this party's starting.
what kind of firepower we talking about, Sam?
you ever see The Dirty Dozen?
a dozen?
you ready?
let's it.
tracking.
all teams moving into position.
welcome.
in 1969, when the U. S. Army stopped making biochemical weapons, they were more advanced than they mitted publicly.
I have recruited an army scientist that remembers the recipes.
on over today
botulinum thats highly flexible.
it can be vaporized against troops on the battle field.
or you can spread it on buets, and even a flesh wound becomes thal.
abu Nassim, the old warhorse.
he's not on Troyger's list of known associates.
Oh, sure he is.
abu Nassim isn't a name.
it's an honorific, from a culture where older people are revered with marks of respect.
his name is Sadiki Hassan.
he's on there, Your Honor Lady Lange.
this party favor is a vaccine to the botulinum.
uncle Sam would never let you have this.
hope we don't need it.
now get in position.
now.
you should all know the value of what you are buying.
and as many of you will resell in your various markets,
I thoght a demonstration would add value.
what kind of demonsttion?
the kind that makes international warns.
the mall.
is there a more representative place of American consumerism?
within the hour, an assocte of mine will deploy just a few micrograms of the botulinum, cut with a vaporizing powder that will carry it throughout the mall.
what mall?
I can't tell what we're looking at.
where is that?
here, in Los Aeles.
but don't worry, Mr. Cook.
you are safe here. - Yeah?
what if I go to do a little shopping before I go home?
is that the Hollywood Town Center?
or is it the Sunset Avenue Mall?
let's just concentrate on the shopping in here first, shall we?
assault turnes back to covert positions.
Eric, Kensi and I will take the Hollywd Town Center.
sent agents over to Sunset.
and HazMa teams to both places.
I'm already on it.
I don't want to scare Troyger.
nobody makes a move on the warehouse till we find this guy the mall.
big guy, I got some bad news.
you're going to have to stall for a while.
now, as you all know, the startinf price will begin at $1 million.
excuse me.
I'm sorry.
but I'm concerned about your donstration.
we still have to bring this stuff out of the country a whole bunch of people g killed in a biochemical attack, they're going to lock the whole city.
you would rather pay several million dollars for something at, as far as you know, could be rushed aspirin?
does anyone else share Mr. Cook's concerns?
apparently, you are the only one who seems to be bothered by this, Mr. Cook.
and why is that?
I just want to do this smart.
seriously, Jacobus, are we here to buy weapons or for you to perverse on me because if these pants come off, I want a discount.
a big discount. You know what I'm saying?
all I know is that you are a very stupid man.
I'm stupid?
at least I don't have these two in the same room together.
Dragovic there killed, uh, Hassan's boy.
don't listen to him.
chechnya, 2002 Hassan's boy is over there, you know, paying his jihadi dues, and Drago was running black ops for, uh, Putin.
code name: Crusar.
you still haven't done me the courtesy.
I'm a ghost.
put your hands behind your back and shut up!
stay where you are!
I'm not seeing anyone from the file of known associates at either place.
nobody acting like they're about to kill hundreds of people.
any luck there, Hetty?
working on it.
I can't do this.
I mean, all those people and it's my fault.
Esther, try not to think about why.
Let's-let's pretend that we are looking for old frnds.
our friend that we're looking for would be right there.
now, who do you know?
listen to you using the objective exact properly.
Oh, look!
that's Captain Hogue!
there with the backpack.
Hollywood Townenter.
Eric, could you go back to the last feed?
Callen, level six.
Tallaucasian male, 30s, bald, yellow backpack.
can't see him.
guys, he's forcing himself to walk casually, but he's clearly trying to hide an adrenaline surge.
this guy is moments away from deploying.
I got him. He's heading for the food court.
Hey! I'm gonna just take this for a second.
thank you.
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
everybody, down!
everybody, down!
keep the vial in the water!
keep it out of the air.
we stay right here till HazMat scrubs us.
you know I hate needles!
it's the antidote, G.
I just saved your life.
I didn't get a warning?
Oh, now I got to warn you to save your life?
just keep the vial in the water!
that's why I like my job.
okay, got it.
the FBI's doing the press conference announcing the arrests of Troyger and the others.
and stealing our credit?
that was all us.
Sam and you and me.
right.
but we don't exist.
that's why you like your job, because we don't exist.
I like my job because I never have to do press conferences.
well, it's true you do have a better face for radio.
ms. Blye, if you touch that thermostat, it'll be to turn it down.
but I'm cold and Callen was pushed in a fountain today.
which is exactly why we need costcutting.
the koi fish in that fountain went belly up from the botulinum.
Oh, dear, one so rarely uses that phrase literally.
poor things.
anyway, the mall has billed us $72, 000.
for fish?! - Yes.
do you know what I could buy with that?
I have a pretty good idea.
apparently they're a prized lineage of Taisho Sanke from Japan.
the dead fish will be here in the morning so I can see them for myself.
what?
I know the difference between koi carp and crap.
all done.
my psychological evaluation of Esther Balmore.
and my strong recommendation that she shouldn't be charged.
she thought she was serving her country.
she won't be charged.
well...that's not all.
she needs, um, someone to adjust her medications, uh, consistent to nursing...
Yeah.
I'll take care of it.
you've come to offer to call the ADA for Esther Balmore, because...
you think watching an old lady go batty has set off a nerve in me.
I came for a cup of tea because I'm cold.
you know, in nursing homes, they only have tea in ba.
so, it just tastes like paper.
when the time comes, I'll bring you the good stuff.
smuggle it in if I have to.
whatever you need.
you know...
it's not the loneliness I fear.
but you are scared of something.
Yes.
filling everything I know.
all my secrets being blathered out into a world that should never hear them.
So,"when the time comes," as you put it, there's something you can do.
you can smother me with a pillow.
make sure it's synthetic.
I'm allergic to feathers.
okay.
Oh, the birds will be so happy!
the delivery man just left them out front, and I just couldn't move them.
you are so kind, Steve.
that's not it.
what is it, dear?
I'm Sam.
right.
uh, say, Sam. - Yes?
this stone fountain.
don't you think it would look better if it was over there?
sure.
piece of cake, Esther.
Oh, careful, Steve!
it's an "Agent Needs Assistance" alert. It's coming from Dom's phone.
dom is missing, not dead.
do whatever you have to do to find him.
I gave Moe a new life.
everything you said to me is a lie.
good-bye, sir.
hello. - Sam.
yeah? - Kensi, we got something. How fast can you be here?
can you translate this?
can you
this should be translated.
Callen. - Hey, G,we got a lead.
you gotta get in here right away. A video just came in.
when?
what do we know?
this appeared on a known Jihadist Web site less than an hour ago.
the evil empire of the West hides behind its false words of peace and its United Nations...
the infidel war machine designed solely to deny Islam and destroy the Muslim world.
if you do not release our falsely accused brother Ala a Din Keshwar within 24 hours...
... this man shall be executed.
Oh, my God. Dom.
looks like it was uploaded at an Internet caf?? in Rabat, Morocco.
strip the hell out of that footage.
identify what's in the room, what's on their clothes, background noises, anything.
send copies to FBI, NSA, anyone who can help.
Kensi, find out who these people are.
where do they operate? Where are they getting their funding?
Nate, put together whatever you can about this Ala a Din Keshwar - and keep Director Vance in the loop. - Got it.
what about Dom's parents?
what about them? - Shouldn't we contact them?
to tell them what... "Your son's not dead, but he's about to be executed"?
at the very least, they could be praying.
they need to know the truth.
I'll have Nate speak with them.
hopefully, by the time we talk to Dom's parents, it will be to tell them that he's been found safe and sound.
we need to secure a transport.
we can put together a basic outfit and gear up once we're on the ground overseas.
overseas where?
we don't even know where they took him.
not yet, but as long as we're wheels up, we can land anywhere in the Middle East or North Africa as soon as we find out who the hell this Ala a Din guy is, who's got him, and where he's being held.
all right, and what happens if we're halfway over the Atlantic, and we discover that he's being held in the Philippines or Indonesia?
they had him over two months, G.
but he looked strong.
he looked like he was hanging in there, right?
all this time and we still don't know who grabbed him, why they grabbed him, or what they hoped to get out of a brand-new agent.
maybe he was a hostage of opportunity.
they brought in Colombians to snatch him. They hired pros.
you think someone's trying to get to us?
if they have Dom, they already have.
all you're giving me is excuses, and I don't have time for it, Dick.
Monty, you owe me and you know it. Just man up.
S'cusez, General.
non, demain est trop tard. Maintenant!
all right, listen up, you flaccid, bureaucratic eunuchs.
I want full cooperation from each of your agencies and unrestricted access to Tunisian airspace, or by God, my next call is to Fradkov, and I will outsource this whole damn operation.
feel better?
something tells me you've done this before.
where are we?
we are playing catch-up in the dark with a ticking clock.
well, I may know someone who can help.
so what are we waiting for?
well, I'm certain he can help.
I'm just not certain that he'll want to, but he owes me a favor... or ten.
well, maybe if you ask him nicely.
it seemed to work with the other gentlemen on the phone.
I doubt that any of them are gentle, and they're certainly not men.
so who is this contact? What do you mean she didn't give you a name? What agency is he with?
we're wasting time.
this guy could be with Animal Control for all I care.
I trust Hetty.
how is the Duchess of Deception?
she's well.
how do you know her?
Ah, she helped me out of a jam here and there back in the day.
you know who we're up against?
not really.
Ala a Din is a brand-new player.
nobody's even got a positive I. D. on this guy.
who's he work for?
we believe his group is called TAJ...
talib Al Jihadiya...
and they are working very hard to make a name for themselves.
now, there were reports he was killed after a bombing in Pakistan.
Taj denied it.
but the latest rumor is, he's been captured by one of our own agencies, but nobody's copping to it.
do you know who has him?
defense Intelligence, Special Activities Division,
national Clandestine Service... take your pick.
whoever's got him ain't sharing.
how come we haven't heard any of this?
nobody has.
my guess is, whoever's got him is keeping his capture a secret, hoping to smoke out the rest of his group because the guys with the biggest trophies get the most funding.
do you have any idea where he is now?
no.
this is all I've got on the TAJ terrorists.
they're thought to have training camps set up in Sudan, Eritrea, possibly even Somalia, but nothing's been confirmed yet.
I'm sorry about your man.
no one deserves to go out like that.
he's not dead yet.
good luck.
Oh, and, uh, tell Hetty they still had her picture up in that bar in Velika Krusa.
no, there.
the other one. - Can you stop hovering?
I'm just trying to help. - Well, you aren't.
it's a computer; it only takes one person to work it.
apparently not.
guys, I haven't been able to find anything on this Ala a Din character.
neither can Eric. - Or you.
pointing fingers is not going to help.
maybe this will. - What is it?
information on suspected TAJ terrorists. See what you can dig out.
where did you get it? - Couldn't tell you if I wanted to.
okay, we've got video, no audio.
we haven't been able to find anything.
I mean nothing. Ala a Din must be an alias.
how much time do we have?
20 hours at the most.
we may be able to reset the deadline if we can give the terrorists some indication they're making progress with their demands.
Eric, stop the video.
now zoom in.
is that your friend Moe?
Yeah.
okay. Thank you, thank you.
Moe's foster parents haven't heard back from Moe since he fled back to Africa, which is the same night that Dom was abducted.
Safar Jadallah recruited Moe and the other boys from the Ethiopian Youth Center to become Jihadis.
he's got to know something.
no, he's in Guantanamo Bay.
it'd take at least eight hours to get him here.
it's better to question him there.
okay, I'll give them a heads-up.
Moe's father was Janjaweed.
the Sudanese government hired them to fight the rebels.
only problem was, they were worse.
hence, the nickname: "devils on horseback with guns.
I killed Moe's father, saving some aid workers.
maybe this is payback.
if Moe is part of Ala a Din's group and they have Dom, there's a good chance Dom is in Sudan.
Yeah, there's also a good chance he's being held in Chad or Libya or Somalia.
if we can't track Moe's movements after he arrived in Chad, we have no idea where he could be.
if we take a plane to Mamba Bay, Kenya, we'd be within striking distance.
we are better working the case from here, using our time and resources to find Dom.
we should be there. We owe it to Dom.
let's just find him first, okay?
having Moe involved... that was our first big break.
at least we have a place to start.
the Youth Center.
may I help you? - Federal agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
this is a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant...
but you have already searched here before two months ago.
Yeah, well, this time we're interested in a terrorist organization known as the Talib Al Jihadiya.
Callen... we've got a runner.
federal agent!
stop!
no, no, no!
let me go! Let me go! Leave me alone!
stay still! Don't move. - Leave me alone!
way to go, Flipper.
think we'll still be able to get something off it?
I sure as hell hope so.
I didn't order any room service.
where is he?
I don't even know who that is.
Mowadh Dusa, he goes by Moe.
he used to hang out at the Youth Center until he went back to Sudan to become a terrorist with Talib Al-Jihadiya.
if you say so.
this man?
special Agent Dominic Vail. He goes by Dom.
he was kidnapped and is being held by TAJ terrorists who are threatening to execute him.
I don't know anything about that.
then why did you run at the Youth Center?
I was late for a class.
that why you threw your computer in the pool?
slipped out of my hand.
and the knife you pulled on my partner?
I was just trying to hand it over to him.
he is smug.
can I go now?
you know how I feel about smug.
no, it's good.
it means he thinks he's smarter than Callen.
so, what's the verdict?
don't take your computer swimming.
look, to do this properly, I should flush it with distilled water, and dry it out with a desiccant over several days.
I don't care about properly, I care about quickly.
there's information on that computer we need now.
I know. But if I power this up, and there's any moisture on the components,
I could fry the motherboard and cause a lethal short to the CPU.
but if we don't, we waste valuable time.
this computer may hold the only chance we have of finding Dom in time to save him.
come on. Do it.
son of a bitch! I...
you know, I told you...
now what am I supposed to do?
fix it.
you help me, I may be able to help you.
but if you don't, it is out of my hands, and you are on a one-way trip to Guant?? namo Bay.
and I promise you, their idea of water sports does not involve a day at the beach.
your threats... do not frighten me.
do you know the difference between courage and stupidity, Yari?
no?
do you know why terrorists target youth groups?
because young people are impressionable.
it's a lot easier to convince teenagers to be suicide bombers.
to become a martyr, shahid, is to die for what you believe in.
the old Istishhad versus Intihar debate.
okay, I got another one for you.
do you know the difference between suicide bombers and martyrs?
trick question. There is no difference.
we pick up both their pieces in a sandwich bag.
it's kind of hard to make out, but, uh, that thing that looks like a bowl of fruit salad...
that's what's left of the, uh, skull of an 11-year-old boy, who detonated a bomb that was strapped to his chest.
I wonder if the heavenly virgins dig the headless horseman look.
look...
if you want to help this man, you can trade him for Ala a Din.
how much time are we gonna waste on this human detritus?
we don't negotiate with terrorists.
well, that's too bad. For your friend.
I can only imagine the look in his face when they cut off his head.
you will be an accessory to murder.
Sam, let him go.
I'm giving him what he wants. Why you struggling? You want shahadah?
stop it! - This is it. You want to be a shahid?
you're on your way to paradise, my friend.
Sam, listen to me, he is no good to us dead.
he's no good to anyone.
and for the record, you don't deserve to die by my hands.
I messed up, G.
he'll live.
thought bringing Moe here was the right thing to do.
it was.
just think about where he'd be right now if you hadn't taken him out of Sudan?
he'd be dead.
Yeah. And Dom would be safe.
the only one who thinks this is your fault is you.
you want to blame yourself, do after we find Dom, okay?
cause right now I need your "A" game, big guy.
so does Dom.
you think this guy Yari's gonna talk?
he might...
if you open a can of jihad on his ass.
the guy is an armchair terrorist at best.
we made it pretty clear we were not messing around.
give me some good news, Kensi.
I have a resignation letter from a former worker.
what's her name?
great.
all right, send whatever you find to my phone.
Kensi found a resignation letter from a worker at the center.
a woman by the name of Ameenah Shah quit because she disapproved of what was going on there.
liking this woman already.
Oh, come on! Come on.
you know I despise your wardrobe?
particularly those flip-flops.
not to mention your surfboard leaning precariously close to my car, the sand you track into the OPS Center, all the millions of dollars of top secret technology you use to play your frivolous video games.
I only left my surfboard near your car once.
twice.
but I don't do it anymore.
but I tolerate it all...
for the most part.
and do you know why, Mr. Beale?
my playful kitten-like personality?
I don't know why I just said that.
I make jokes when I'm nervous.
use humor as a defense mechanism. It's a bad habit.
I don't even know why I'm still talking.
I tolerate it because you are unequaled at what you do.
I am the way I am, because I demand the best.
this is an elite unit whose unparalleled success rests on the superior skills of those who work here.
and that's why I know that if anyone can fix this...
it is you.
I'm trying.
I know, I know, and I'm sorry.
I should have trusted your judgment earlier.
and because I pushed you, I may have buggered everything.
but I have complete faith in you, Mr. Beale.
do do what you do.
that's for good luck.
Thanks.
Yes. Come on, baby.
come to Papa.
thank you for coming and enjoy the rest of your visit.
have a good day. Bye-bye. Thank you.
Ameenah Shah? - Yes?
I'm Special Agent Callen, this is Special Agent Sam Hanna. We're from NCIS.
we'd like to ask you some questions about your time spent working at the Ethiopian Youth Organization.
you know a young Sudanese man from the center, Mowadh Dusa?
no.
I worked mainly in an administration capacity...
organizing schedules, classes.
your resignation letter cited concerns about some of what they were teaching there.
ideological differences are not a crime.
they are if they lead to terrorist activities.
I should be getting back to work.
the man in this video is a federal agent.
he is also a friend, and he will be executed if we can't find him.
I'm sorry, but I know nothing about this.
Ameenah, you have a degree in early childhood education.
clearly, you care about young people.
something happened at that Youth Center that caused you to quit.
now, I think it's the same thing that caused several of these boys like Moe to disappear.
these same young men are about to murder a federal agent, and they will be terrorists.
this is your chance to save a lot of lives.
there was a man who started to teach religious studies that became more and more radical.
Safar Jadallah?
Yes. - Yeah, we picked him up a while back. Who else?
there was another man who started to come around after Safar got arrested.
he was very angry that Safar was gone.
I think he donated money to the center.
his name was Kalil.
I don't know his last name. I'm sorry.
I must get back to work.
Eric, it's Callen.
listen, I need everything you can find on a guy named Kalil.
he was connected with the Youth Center.
I don't have a last name, but I believe he provided funding.
Yeah, yeah. His name's in Yari's computer.
you got it working? - Getting there.
Yeah, here it is. Kalil Abramson.
heavy hitter in commercial real estate.
single, envious bank account.
one outstanding parking ticket for an expired meter on Robertson.
find him.
here you are, sir. Okay.
Yes.
federal agents.
we'd like to ask you some questions concerning your involvement with the Ethiopian Youth Organization.
uh, it's one of my pet projects.
I'm very active in youth and environmental issues.
but please have a seat, join us.
it's probably not a good idea, considering your credit cards have been frozen, along with the rest of your assets.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
we'll explain everything after you come with us.
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in the middle of a business meeting.
then why did you ask us to join you?
I was being polite. - Well, I'm not.
you're under arrest on charges of knowingly funding terrorist activities.
well, then, I'm very glad that I'm here in the company of my attorneys.
we're going to need a new camera.
Kalil Abramson was tipped off.
he was surrounded by a wall of lawyers before we even got to him.
he's not going to help us if it means implicating himself.
he might if it mitigates charges of conspiracy, terrorism and the murder of a federal agent.
there's been no murder. Dom is not dead.
stop referring to him in the past tense.
it was just a worst-case scenario for Abramson.
forget about worst-case scenarios.
there's only one-case scenario.
that's finding and rescuing Dom.
Moe once told me he felt safest with his friends at the Youth Center.
maybe he's still in touch with them.
okay, okay. If they were culling potential Jihadists from the Youth Center, it makes sense they'd want young men like Moe...
there's a SEAL team on standby aboard the USS Cole.
they're off the Horn of Africa as part of NATO's Operation Ocean Shield.
the minute we give them a location, they'll hit it hard.
I've called in every favor I can think of.
I don't think I can go through this again.
we're going to find him, Hetty.
do you really believe that?
Yes.
because we're not going to stop looking until we do.
I'm going to hold you to that.
extreme situations occasionally require extreme measures, Mr. Callen.
but at the end of the day, one's methods are seldom questioned when they bring about the necessary results.
keep moving.
where did you learn to speak English?
television.
what's your favorite show?
what's your name?
you shouldn't have done that.
Why?
you're just going to kill me anyway.
that's not certain.
my country does not negotiate with terrorists.
so if you don't help me escape, you'll be a murderer, too.
and I know you don't want my blood on your hands.
how do you know that?
because you're talking to me... in English.
you know this man? - No.
do you know this guy?
no.
one of you tipped off Kalil Abramson.
Yeah, well, don't look at me, man.
what the hell are you doing?
I want to know which one of you tipped off Kalil.
I don't even know who that is.
and I've never seen this guy before in my life.
tell him. I don't know you, do I?
no.
I didn't know that guy, and I didn't tip off Kalil.
I swear to God.
whose god would that be, huh?
what makes you think I believe in any of them?
you can't do this. I haven't done anything.
that's exactly what he said.
please. I... I can help you.
you don't know anything.
and unfortunately, you just saw me kill a man.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
I know about Mowadh Dusa and the other boys who left the center and went to Chad.
you know where they are? - No.
do you know where they're holding Agent Vail?
no, but I know who does... Kalil Abramson.
he paid to recruit the young men to become Jihadis.
he bought their plane tickets, their training.
he even paid the Colombians to kidnap the agent.
he's the man behind all this.
he knows where your friend is.
agent Nassir, you all right?
fine. Did he talk?
Yeah. Kalil Abramson's behind all of this.
what about his lawyers?
it's gonna take more than lawyers to save him this time.
anything else from the TAJ terrorists?
messages? Videos? Anything? - Nothing.
we've got less than 40 minutes until our 24-hour deadline.
what else have you got on Abramson, Eric?
you get anything else off of Yari's computer?
money trail's hard to follow. Kalil's been very careful.
also, he's also been traveling a lot.
mostly in Europe, but on April 6, he hops a plane from Athens to Cairo.
then he goes from Egypt to Khartoum in Sudan, and then, pops up in Asmara, Eritrea.
he's there for a couple days, then goes to someplace called Berbera in Somalia, before heading into Yemen.
it's a terrorist tour group.
sudan, Eritrea and Somalia are the same three countries thought to hold training camps for Talib Al Jihadiya.
Dom's in one of those camps, and Kalil Abramson knows which one.
Eric, can you turn on Kalil's cell phone?
way ahead of you.
unfortunately, I haven't been able to pick up any audio.
his phone's at his house in Malibu.
hasn't moved in several hours.
son of a bitch is sleeping while Dom's about to be executed.
I'm open to ideas, guys.
think. We're running out of time.
what about extraordinary rendition?
no. Kalil Abramson obtained his American citizenship six years
citizenship can be revoked No. Kafor acts of treason.
rarely and only after a lengthy process.
I've secured a fully crewed, fully fueled C-130 at Edwards Air Force Base.
if you were to put Kalil Abramson on that plane under the guise of an unlawful enemy combatant, which he is, for all intents and purposes...
on his way to a black site for interrogation.
I've heard rumors that Bondsteel in Kosovo is particularly ugly.
you're suggesting torture by proxy?
no. Of course not.
but if Kalil thinks that's what's happening, well, I'm sure he'll start talking before you hit Barstow.
none of which would hold up in court.
this isn't about building a court case.
this is about rescuing Dom.
whether you rescue Dom or not,
Kalil Abramson and his lawyers will come after us with a vengeance, and Abramson will walk because of it.
not to mention, something like this could end the career of everyone in this room.
saving a fellow agent is more important than any career, Nate.
I'm with Sam.
me, too.
someone once told me that extreme situations occasionally call for extreme measures.
what the hell?
I really wanted to be a magician anyway.
far be it from me to thwart your dreams of a career in prestidigitation, Mr.
getz, but if anyone is going to take the fall for this, it will be me.
he's in motion... Kalil... he's moving.
let's do it.
do you know how much time I have?
no.
wait, wait.
I want to send a message to my parents.
I can't help you with that. I'm sorry.
eat your breakfast.
he's turning onto Broadway.
looks like he's stopping.
Eric, he's headed into the Palace Theater.
it's kind of early for a matinee.
Kalil Abramson bought that theater a few years ago.
supposedly he's turning it into a center for the performing arts.
Oh, wonderful.
the proceeds from tonight's performance of Equus will be donated to help support your local Taliban.
we need to keep an open line to the USS Cole, Eric.
the minute we get Kalil to tell us where Dom is, they have to scramble that SEAL team.
copy that.
we could use a layout of this place.
will do. Got it.
is anybody out there? !
Eric, we've got shots fired.
sounds like it came from above.
I'll see if I can find a camera.
I found a couple of security cameras on the building next door.
I'm trying to access them now.
Oh, my God.
Kensi, what is it?
I'm in the room where they were holding Dom.
this is where they shot the video.
Callen, he never left L. A.
I've got two camera feeds. They're from the roofs next door.
Moe, wait a minute. Moe!
I've got Dom. He's on the roof.
dom is on the roof. - Moe is here, too.
he's one floor above you, G. I'm going to the roof.
I got him, I got Dom. He's alive.
DOM, come on!
get down!
come on! - Zooming in on camera B.
Sam, you got a shooter on the roof.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Kalil's in the stairwell.
you okay? - Yeah. I knew you guys would find me.
look out! - Sam!
No! Dom! Dom's been hit!
Dom's hit! He's down! Dom's down!
Eric, Medivac, now. - Right.
hang in there, buddy.
I'm pinned down!
Kalil's down! Kensi!
all clear!
medivac is en route, Callen.
Kensi, keep your eyes open.
come on! Hang in there, Dom!
Oh, come on.
they got his femoral artery.
Where's the damn Medivac?!
Medivac's on their way.
come on!
Sam, all you're doing is pumping out what blood's left in his body.
come on, Dom, fight, man!
Sam... He's gone, Sam.
I ain't giving up on him, G.
you didn't.
none of us did.
cyprus - Do you mind? - Go ahead.
you in town for business?
something like that.
I'm actually here to forget about business.
you know, you should try it sometime.
maybe I will.
excuse me.
all right, you ready for this? Here it comes.
Oh, uh, uh, Matisse?
Nope. Munch.
um... Van Gogh?
no. Cezanne. Wow. You really do suck at this.
so you wouldn't buy it. - Absolutely not.
I mean, I don't know if I would.
I mean, it depends. I guess it depends kind of the price.
I mean, yeah, no-- I definitely would, I definitely, I would.
you hazing the new guy or is he hazing you?
haze me, Kensi, please?
Seurat. - Monet.
Sam proceeds to the bonus round.
and Kensi wins the consolation prize otherwise known as a steaming bucket of fail.
what case is this?
it's not a case. It's Anna Kline.
my best friend from childhood who's visiting L. A.
our fathers were stationed at Camp Lejeune.
we stayed close. Meeting her for lunch today.
married, four-year-old son.
she in the art business?
she thinks I am. Told her I was a curator at a gallery.
a curator?
I had to choose a cover story.
art galleries are cool, glamorous, filled with sophisticated people.
who know about art.
I once dated a girl for three months who thought I was a dentist.
Dr. Deeks, DDS.
then one night we were at dinner, and her filling falls out.
and she's sitting across from me, and she's crying out in pain, begging for me to help.
What'd you do?
ordered shots of 151-proof rum.
told her to soak it in it, kill all the germs.
pretty soon she couldn't feel her face, let alone her tooth.
it was hilarious.
you know, everyone in our line of work has this regrettable, necessary choice.
either be a hermit or be a cover story.
Hetty,"Cover story" is just a more dignified way of saying "lie
I am lying to my friend.
well, sometimes it's better to just leave the lie in place.
if a loved one really cares about you, the lie won't matter.
are you speaking from experience, Hetty?
it's amazing how much one can learn from field manuals, Mr. Callen.
ladies and gentlemen, it's that time again.
you may want to cancel any impending lunch plans.
anyone heard from Nate?
Nope, not a call, not even an email.
we don't even know where he is.
what do you have for us, Eric?
the anatomy of a perfect hit.
cyprus: Meet Special Agent Dan Williams, NCIS.
yesterday, he was meeting a contact.
he was aware that he was being watched.
his tradecraft is good.
he's spotted all security cameras and exits.
he's keeping an eye on the crowd.
she's running interference. But for whom?
this guy-- upstairs in Williams's room.
williams is focused on the threats in the lounge but not upstairs.
flirty lady's keeping him busy.
and she's staying anonymous, too.
the shape of her hair's hiding her face from the cameras in the lounge.
just like that Sheik's keffiyeh obscuring his face from the camera.
that cocktail waitress is only serving people who are head-on to the cameras.
all we can see is the back of her head.
the hats look natural with their outfits.
no I. D. possible.
Oh, right there-- what was that?
he sent a file from his PDA to the NCIS cloud before he got killed.
unfortunately, it got corrupted.
the sporty couple-- they're tipping off the guy in the room.
agent Williams was killed by an injection of succinylcholine.
it causes instant cardiac arrest.
Made- like he died of natural causes upon first examination.
20 minutes ago, a man used a Canadian passport to enter LAX from London.
ins photo caught 18 points of interest.
16 of which match...
John White. It's an alias.
where is he now?
being detained by Customs at LAX.
he's been told it's a routine search.
they're waiting for us.
you arrest him, he may not talk.
he could be in town for something bigger.
we could take a chance.
let him go, tail him, see what he's up to.
just snatch him later. - It's risky.
he killed one of ours.
and if he's detained, he'll already suspect he's being gamed.
if he's in town for something bigger, it might be a risk worth taking.
if he does get away, it's gonna be on us.
I like a little bit of pressure.
it does make things more interesting.
I want you two to cover the other end of the case.
agent Williams was investigating a rebel group in Chechnya.
and how far are we away from fixing that file that Williams sent from his PDA?
uh, we're moving slowly but surely.
it's 13% complete.
welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
dentist, gallery curator.
this is the man who once posed as a sommelier for an entire year.
I've got my vintages, varietals and appellations down pat.
how could I forget?
merlot, Bordeaux, Pinot.
you bought a gold pin and you wore it.
it was my day-to-day cover story, and I earned that pin.
I didn't buy it.
I took classes and I graduated.
I went all out to develop my palate.
you wore a pin shaped like a corkscrew...
for a year.
you were a magician once.
not magician. Illusionist.
you bought a white rabbit, G.
it came with the hat. There he is.
here we go.
Taxi!
he's going around the block again.
something's not right.
cabbie's taking him in circles.
he's not taking him to a meet, thisisthe meet.
he knows the cab driver.
it's going down right now in front of us.
he's stopping.
no, he's not.
I knew I should've drove.
federal agent! Stop!
don't move! Don'tmove.
Hey! What's going on?
federal agent! Stay back!
we got nothing.
it was a gypsy cab, Kensi.
fake medallion number, fake plates.
driver's in the wind.
I didn't get a good enough look to even give a description.
move it. - Have Eric keep checking for cameras.
Yeah, we're headed to the boathouse.
lost him? - For now.
can't you pull him out of your hat?
williams was investigating a rebel group in Chechnya called the Grozny Emirate.
islamic radicals with ties to Al Qaeda.
founded nine years ago by Vakar.
no known last name. - Just Vakar?
one name. In the grand tradition of Cher, Madonna, Bono...
Ah, great. And this is the best image we've got?
Oh, planning subway bombings in Moscow probably isn't a photo - friendly occupation.
or a safe one. Vakar was killed by Russian forces seven years ago.
well, hiring a hit squad of this caliber to take out an American agent isn't cheap.
Williams' file says the Grozny Emirate only has $5 million in liquid assets.
something doesn't track-- they can't afford it.
I mean, the money or the spotlight that comes with killing an NCIS agent.
unless it was personal.
jon Craig. British citizen.
former SAS out of Credenhill.
so, Jon... throwing away 20 years of service to become a killer-for-hire?
I'm curious.
my pension didn't hold my interest.
huh. My pension wasn't great either.
but I got hobbies.
and a gold corkscrew pin.
don't ask him.
I'm a professional.
either charge me or release me.
actually, there's a third option.
because you're a foreign national and you're a suspect in the murder of a federal agent, you're classified as an enemy combatant.
do you know what that means, Jon?
it means you play ball with us or we ship your ass off to prison in an undisclosed location with a whole lot of sand and very little regard for human rights.
that professional enough for you?
what sort of deal are you offering?
gentlemen, someone in this city is going to die very soon unless you give me an incentive to help.
we can reroute your prison flight from Tunisia to Florida.
I would take that.
if you think Tunisian prison cuisine sucks, well, believe me, the lack of plumbing is even worse.
I'm in Los Angeles for a hit.
my team's been hired to complete a lethal action on a local target.
who's the target? - I don't know.
who hired you?
I don't know. I get my fee via wire transfer.
we're a team-- same as you-- with security protocols.
we don't know the name of the target or the target's location until we check in at a predetermined rally point.
who was driving the taxi?
my contact. That's all I know about the hit.
with you off the board, there is no hit anymore, right?
wrong.
each of us has a backup in place, in case this exact scenario should occur.
if I don't turn up to do the job, then my backup does.
if he doesn't hear from me within the next hour, he goes in.
has your backup met the rest of the team members?
no.
and tell them Craig didn't check in, you're stepping up?
when they take me through the plan, we will have the target's name and location.
I stay with the hit squad.
you get a tactical team into position at the kill point.
you move in before the hit happens, we take these guys out.
Craig is the only one we positively I. D.'d in Cyprus, which means we can't arrest them till right before the hit goes down.
catch them red-handed while they're already on high alert.
this is a dangerous op we're talking about.
I know this is the only way, but it doesn't mean I gotta like it.
call your backup, tell him everything's fine.
you're going to tell me everything there is to know about him.
s These are highly trained individuals.
former military and intelligence.
you won't last five minutes.
that's my problem.
I appreciate your concern, Jon.
just make the call. This time, I'm driving.
his name is Nathan Wilson.
take me through your cover story.
I'm Nathan Wilson, former Green Beret, buddy of Jon Craig's from our contracting days in the Green Zone.
I'm good to go.
my button mic is up and running.
I'll be here with Kensi and Deeks.
we hear the distress word, we'll be inside in less than 60 seconds.
and the distress word is "abracadabra.
which one of you is Thierry?
I'm Nathan Wilson.
I don't know you.
jon Craig missed his check-in call.
why wouldn't Jon check in?
I don't ask questions.
I just stick to the plan.
he's clean. - I find this all very interesting.
Why's that? - Because I'm Nathan Wilson.
did Jon Craig give us the wrong intel? - We gotta move in now.
not yet. He didn't say the distress word.
I know my partner.
Thierry, I know we haven't met, but this guy has got to be a cop.
jon is a professional.
if he doesn't check in, it's because he's been arrested.
and he gave up this location and my name; I don't know why.
but I don't know who the hell this guy is, and I hope to God you haven't given him any information on the target, because this guy's a cop.
this guy's the cop, Thierry!
he's covering his own ass!
he's outraged and counter-accusing.
standard police protocol when your cover's been blown.
you both have ten seconds to sort this thing out.
the loser dies.
ten... - Go.
nine... eight...
seven... six... five...
four... three... two...
I'm impressed.
jon would've needed a new pair of skivvies.
welcome to the team, Nathan.
it was a test.
you passed.
target's name is Emma Mastin.
location? - Sherman Oaks.
Eric, I need everything on Emma Mastin.
she lives in Sherman Oaks.
Emma Mastin. " 29 years old.
no criminal record.
looks like she's a stay-at-home mom.
perfect credit.
normal balances in all of her accounts.
married to...
clay Mastin, who also checks out.
no criminal record. Both clean.
why hire a pro hit squad to take out a soft target like her?
they're gonna whack some lady in the suburbs?
I'll watch G's back.
you two pay Emma Mastin a visit.
see what you can dig up on her.
and keep your cover story simple, Dr. Deeks.
Eric, we're gonna need help getting in the front door.
I'm on it.
initial surveillance indicates the target goes to this Fields Market on Moorpark every Tuesday at 4: 00 p. m.
how long was the initial surveillance period?
four weeks. Our intel is solid.
tradecraft is a dying art.
nice to see someone pays attention to the details.
well, welcome to the A-Team.
we'll be positioned inside the grocery store when the target enters.
this will be an undercover operation.
we'll be posing as employees.
why this market?
I mean, why not the parking lot or her house?
wh-wh-what makes this the ideal location?
I thought you didn't ask questions.
the parking lot is a half a block from the police station.
her house has neighbors.
potential witnesses who may remember anomalies.
and the market has multiple exits...
and access to three different freeways within what, half a mile?
and a security camera blind spot located right here.
we'll make sure she lands on it.
and when she does, you'll strike.
Oh, if you miss for any reason,
I'll be there to complete the objective.
yes? - Hetty, it's me.
what do you have, Sam?
I got the hit squad's game plan. It's going down this afternoon.
I need a tactical team in position at the Fields Market on Moorpark.
what do you know about alarms?
enough.
I did two years-- LAPD Robbery Division.
I did an urban counter - surveillance course at Quantico.
graduated top of my class.
I guess there's book smart and then there's street smart.
I'll run point.
I wasn't bragging.
of course not. You were just one-upping me.
I'm not a one-upper.
not normally. Somehow just with me.
but have fun running point.
great. Have fun watching.
see? One-upping.
Hi.
Hi. Mrs. Mastin, we're from Live Feed Security.
Oh, what took you guys so long?
I keep turning it off, but it keeps turning back on.
let me take a look at the cue pad.
here we go.
okay, it was a system error.
just needed to key in the master override code.
mommy, the strange man is snooping.
joshua, this man is our guest.
be polite.
he made all the noises go away.
what's up, little man? I'm Marty.
do you play video games?
I do, I do.
but I'm actually, uh, I'm actually working right now, Joshua.
mommy, can he play?
well...
if it's okay with you, Marty?
show me the way.
so how old is he?
he's six.
Oh, my God, mine's four.
it all happened so fast, it blows my mind.
you're a working mom?
Yeah.
may I?
sure.
that's my husband Clay.
you're awesome at this.
when do I go? You tell me when.
right when we started dating I got pregnant.
Oh, you're so much better than me.
but we were in love.
you got me, buddy.
beautiful family.
I'm really lucky to have Clay.
I've actually never heard that language before, Mrs. Mastin.
I just have to ask, uh, what is it?
it's Chechen.
there's something you need to know.
my partner and I are federal agents.
someone wants you dead.
that doesn't make any sense.
please leave my house.
Emma, we're not here to arrest you.
we're here to help you. But to do that, you have to work with us.
go.
you're in serious danger.
you and your family.
I need to know the truth for your family's sake.
please, be honest with me.
sometimes it's easier to just leave the lie in place, isn't it?
Hey, guys, I don't speak Arabic.
it's not Arabic, it's Farsi.
I don't speak that either.
the syringe is in the bag.
don't stick yourself.
no gun?
you won't need one.
hello.
Deeks, Vakar's still alive.
whoa, but the file said he was killed seven years ago by Russians.
the file was wrong.
Vakar is the one who put the hit out on Agent Williams.
now he's got them after Emma Mastin.
what's up, dude?
why does Vakar want you dead?
he's alive.
he hired a hit squad.
I...
have no idea why some Chechen psycho wants me, of all people, dead.
Emma, can you stop lying to me, please?
we're here to protect you.
we can only do that if you help us.
even if you stop this hit squad, he'll just send another one.
there is a way to end this right now.
who are you?
someone who is willing to do anything to protect her family.
that is not an answer.
let them come.
use me as bait.
I can't ask you to do that.
I'm in no position to authorize it.
I'm volunteering.
I want to do it.
why, Emma?
because if Vakar did send these people, I need to send a message back to him.
and what message is that?
it is not gonna be easy.
talk to your team.
this is your best shot.
Hello? - We need to meet.
NCIS must be in real trouble if the Duchess of Deception is meeting me in person.
almost as much trouble as you were in, in Cape Town.
cape Town.
who is Emma Mastin?
haven't heard that name in awhile.
she's a former Shahidka.
that's Chechen for...
Ooh, for "Black Widow.
women whose terrorist husbands are killed in action.
islamic groups take advantage of their grief.
program them to become suicide bombers.
but she obviously wasn't a suicide bomber.
she was no run-of-the-mill grieving widow, either.
she started as an operative.
intensive training by ex-KGB.
she's fluent in five languages.
run by Grozny Emirate.
and she was good.
solid tradecraft.
but scary.
easily as deadly as any of the men.
pardon my language, but how the hell did this woman wind up a housewife in Sherman Oaks?
typical Cinderella story.
if Cinderella was a Chechen assassin.
Callan's in place.
once Thierry moves in on Emma, he'll intercept him.
we'll have the squad for attempted murder.
I'll be with the tactical unit on site.
I still don't feel comfortable about putting her at risk like this.
you'll keep a tail on her outside the market.
everything goes smoothly, we'll take this crew down.
guys, that file that Special Agent Williams sent from his PDA
it's now restored.
I'm sending it to the main screen.
a sonogram.
first trimester.
date indicated is January 7, 2004.
same month Vakar was supposedly killed.
looks familiar, doesn't he?
I just spoke to my source.
evidently Emma was a former Grozny Emirate operative.
she thought her husband Vakar was dead.
he wanted everyone to think he had been killed.
Emma discovered she was carrying his unborn child, flipped sides.
agent Williams figured out that Vakar had a child, and when Vakar knew what Williams knew, he hired the hit squad to take him out.
now Emma's the only thing standing between him and the thing he wants more than anything else in the world.
his son.
we're waiting on Callen's signal.
he'll give us the green light to move in.
agent Roger that.
take care of the employees?
they're tied up in the back.
the syringe is prepped?
ready to go.
good.
if you lose your opening, give me the word.
I'll clean up.
all right, thanks.
protective detail just moved Joshua.
he's secure for now.
if Emma's a former operative, then she's got situational awareness.
she knew what this was about from the very start.
that's why she offered herself up.
she's not a soft target; she just looks like one.
that's why Vakar sent professionals to take her out.
Hi. Welcome to Fields Market.
what kind of cheese is this?
it's cheddar.
it's been aged for five years.
would you like to try one?
maybe another time.
if you like that sauce, you really need to try the new cuts our butcher got in today.
they're that good, huh?
I wouldn't steer you wrong.
they're just around the corner. I'd be happy to show you.
just go right at the next aisle.
she'll be out in just a moment.
okay. Thank you.
she's in the blind spot.
Callen's about to tell Thierry the syringe is jammed.
get ready to move in.
agent Got it.
syringe malfunction.
time to step up.
move on my command.
Sam, I don't see Thierry anywhere.
do not move in.
I repeat, do not move in.
something's up.
Thierry's changing up his plan.
thank you.
this woman's good.
she's maintaing her cover.
knows the hit squad's still watching her.
Thierry's gone, Sam.
I don't have him, either, G.
damn it. Move in now.
let's go!
move in! Move in!
federal agents!
federal agents! Nice try.
likewise.
this team's a decoy.
who's got eyes on Emma?
Kensi and Deeks.
she'll be heading home.
keep it coming!
good...
keep it coming.
a bit more.
that's good.
we're blocked off from her.
it's a setup.
cover my back.
right.
follow me.
not bad for a magician.
illusionist.
okay, great. Thank you.
so, Joshua's protective detail should be here any minute now.
I thought I left that life behind.
from what I saw, you seem to still be pretty good at it.
my husband's on his way home.
he's going to want answers.
he raised Joshua like his own flesh and blood.
I will tell him anything about my past that he wants to know, but I can't tell him the truth about Joshua.
about his real father.
Vakar.
this is one lie that I need to keep in place, Kensi.
if this man loves you as much as you love him, it's not going to matter.
the truth will not pull you apart.
if anything, it's going to bring you closer.
Emma, what happened? What's going on?
thank you...
for everything.
there's something I need to tell you.
so, Emma and her family got their happy ending.
new names, new locations and brand-spanking-new cover stories.
there's still one loose end.
you guys had an audience today.
he was there.
how'd it go with your friend?
I blew it. That's how it went.
felt like Anna saw straight through my cover story.
it gets easier, right?
Yes.
you're lying.
am I?
good night, Hetty.
Oh, Sylvia.
tell us a little bit about yourself.
um, I'm 14.
I like to run.
and... I love Beyoncé
you have a boyfriend?
I don't know.
what do you mean? Come on.
do I?
Yeah. Definitely. If you want.
daddy? - Hi, Commander Rehme.
you're videotaping my daughter in a hot tub?
it's not like that. - Get out of here. Now.
Yes, sir.
you should go to bed.
Daniel, are you there?
daddy?
help me!
help! Help me!
Oh, no! No, no, no... no, no.
help me!
I mean, that really exists?
I thought that was some urban legend.
I didn't think people actually had that. - I do.
you're really afraid of clowns. - Yeah.
what kind of clowns are we talking about?
clowns like Deeks? Or clowns like, uh...
no, real clowns. Orange hair. Fat-toed shoes.
so, we bust in on some terrorists, they pop on a red nose, and you're gonna freeze up on me?
I reveal a vulnerable part of myself, and you mock me?
hell, yeah. - Well, I have chaetophobia.
fear of hair?
impressive. Gold star for the new girl. - Way to go, Nell.
I didn't see that in your "Romancing the One" profile.
how did you know that I... - I do now.
go, Deeks.
well, you'll never find it. It's an alias.
starting off the relationship with a lie?
how's that ever going to lead to true love?
are you afraid of all hair?
back hair.
shaggy back hair. On men specifically. It's...
I shouldn't have brought it up. - You really shouldn't have.
you got me out of the clown thing.
is that your, uh, porn star cover?
how did you find that? No, no, no, Deeks. Don't do this.
dentures, hoarders, prison records.
setting the bar pretty high there, huh? - Deeks.
martial arts, techno music, and first dates at the zoo.
don't most animals have hair on their backs?
that's how she faces her fears.
ladies and gentlemen, make haste.
let's move it, Charlene.
commander Jason Rehme designs and maintains the cryptographic logons
he's a computer tech.
no, no. I know this guy. Read all his stuff.
commander Jason Rehme literally holds the keys to the navy's classified kingdom in his head.
to call Jason Rehme a computer tech is to call...
lady Gaga just a singer.
still lovin' the Gaga, huh?
commander Jason Rehme is missing.
he had a department meeting at 06: 00.
he never showed.
he hasn't answered any calls, texts or e-mails.
he'd be a prime target for both domestic and international terrorists.
so as of 0600, we are compromised.
he's been missing for an hour and a half. Send me his last known whereabouts.
let's move.
detective Deeks?
I will always love the Gaga.
door's locked.
Kensi, Deeks. - Let's go.
no one here.
still warm. Someone made coffee.
coffee could have been on a timer. Bed was slept in.
no sign of a mom living in the house. He's got a daughter, though.
Amanda, 14.
guys, I found blood.
no drops. Smearing, like somebody was dragged towards the woods.
property backs up to Angeles National Forest.
blood starts here.
I found the commander.
it's my daughter's.
I upset her last night. I went looking for her.
in the woods?
she goes running on the trails in the morning.
you don't run in flip-flops.
why didn't you call the cops?
once you get in the woods, there's no cell service.
I wanted to find her quickly.
what was your fight about?
she had a boy over. It was stupid. I made him leave.
the boy's name?
Daniel something. Daniel Proffer.
her mom died?
four years ago. How did you know that?
divorcees don't normally have pictures of their ex all over the house.
I just wanted to tell her I was sorry.
you can tell her when we find her.
the, uh, forest service is calling in all the rangers,
they'll start a search.
Daniel, the boyfriend, was home in bed.
I got agents heading over to confirm.
what is it?
it says it's from Amanda, but it's not her email address.
it's a web link to a video. It's linked to my email.
Oh, God.
see if Eric can get a trace on this. - Done.
Oh, no. No.
FBI Agent Rand, Sam Hanna.
is the father secure? He shouldn't see this.
commander Rehme's outside with our agents.
play it.
three other girls have been kidnapped and left to die in boxes buried underground.
two of the girls' bodies were found, but one was never recovered.
I remember this. - You got this guy.
Yeah, we did. Two years ago. Lucas Maragos.
Maragos would send the video to the parents of the girls.
he got off on torturing their families.
can you bring our video up here?
the video we got is a dead ringer for these.
look at the killer's hands. Same blue surgical gloves.
then we have a copycat.
were these tapes released publicly?
they were used as evidence during the trial, so there was access.
what if Maragos has a partner?
there was no evidence of a partner.
but I'll go back through the files and see if any names pop up in connection with him.
I need you to hold this match. - Okay.
don't let it go out. We only got three left.
I'm going to push the top. Try to bend it open.
the FBI will take it from here. Thanks, guys.
can I talk to you?
of course.
I don't know these guys.
I'm navy, born and bred. I trust NCIS.
is there a way you can stay on this?
it's no longer our jurisdiction.
I lost my wife.
I can't lose my child. Please.
I understand. But there's nothing...
we'll see what we can do.
you want to tell me what that was all about?
Sam, talk to me.
why did you tell him that?
because that's what I'm going to do.
I want to stay on the abduction case.
it doesn't fall within our purview, Mr. Hanna.
I think it does.
because copycat.
while the FBI is running around looking for a killer,
that's an interesting theory.
I'm taking a leave of absence.
that's very dramatic.
Sam, please don't turn your back on me.
I would never do that to you.
find her.
the Angeles National Forest is close to 650, 000 acres.
if Amanda is buried somewhere in there, finding her is going to be next to impossible.
what about infrared off a satellite?
if she's buried, her body temperature is dropping.
it's not going to work.
what's this?
equestrian center. There are horse trails here.
uh, there's a kids' camp here, only open in the summer.
can you bring up the kidnapper's video again?
Yeah.
these are three FBI videos and Amanda's.
the M. O. is really consistent.
the same camera angle, same size boxes.
same blue surgical gloves.
searching the nearest surveillance cams, we got a black '09 Chevy Malibu possibly headed from the park at 4: 30 a. m.
can't see the driver.
no plates. Somebody's hiding something.
it's got a fender bender on the rear driver's side.
09 is new. You'd make an insurance claim.
I got two matches in the L. A. area.
one, the insurance photos don't match.
the other looks like our car.
all right, it's leased to Galea Shipping.
they're a Greek company that operates out of the Port of L. A.
Oh, this one is assigned to the president of the company.
what is it?
the president of the company is Andre Maragos.
he's the brother of Lucas Maragos.
the guy convicted of the first three murders.
Deeks, can you get out to U. S. Penitentiary at Victorville and...
talk to Lucas Maragos, see if I can make some sense of this? Done.
now, according to FBI files, all the boxes were buried at the same depth, and the dimensions of the boxes were exactly the same.
calculating the remaining oxygen...
Amanda's got about nine hours to live.
I want a countdown on screen-- nine hours.
I want it on the big monitors with her picture.
I want everybody in the office to see it.
Eric, you get anything off the security camera?
no go, it's a closed circuit, and the alarm company indicates no recorders.
Thanks.
may I help you? - Federal agents to see Mr. Maragos.
Kensi, hang back, then see if you can find the Malibu.
nice place.
this way, please.
you men are federal agents?
Mr. Maragos, do you drive a black Malibu?
no. What is this about?
your company Galea Shipping leases a Chevy Malibu that may have been photographed near the scene of a crime.
my company leases probably close to 50 cars.
go. - Found the Malibu.
how did you get in here?
the garage was locked with an alarm.
Oh, my bad, I'm so sorry. I was looking for the ladies' room.
teeny, tiny, little bladder.
Eric matched the dent. It's the car.
you lied to a federal agent, Mr. Maragos.
is this the car Jennifer uses?
our personal assistant drives this car.
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know a Malibu from a Taurus.
I don't think I've ever even seen this car.
I park mine in the driveway.
Jennifer drives the boys to school in the morning.
my husband leaves the house before they're even up.
where was Jennifer last night?
alaska, backpacking.
Mr. Maragos, is this you and your brother?
Yes.
Oh, God.
you were in camp together?
he's, he's mentally ill, but I have no connection to him whatsoever.
one more time-- were you in camp together?
Yes.
where is this camp located?
the Angeles National Forest.
exactly where a young girl was kidnapped this morning.
is all that jewelry really necessary?
they have trust issues. - You've got ten minutes, huh?
guy buries three girls in the ground, I guess it's understandable, right?
well, they only found two girls.
Yeah, I'm actually not here to debate the details of your case.
God is in the details and so is my freedom.
another girl was kidnapped. That's a detail which means
I may not have to spend the rest my life in here.
was the M. O. the same?
exactly the same.
you got a partner on the outside?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Check my call records, my e-mail.
I did. The only phone calls you make are to your brother Andre.
so is that it?
you and your brother like killing together?
yeah? Bury the girls and then sit there giggling with each other while they suffocate to death?
I didn't kill those girls.
of course not. - No.
is there any evidence at all that points to my brother?
he could have committed all these murders.
we're related. The DNA's got to be close.
nobody checked my brother's DNA.
you and your brother went to camp together in the Angeles National Forest.
remember that?
we think the latest girl could be buried there.
I help you find her, you reopen my case.
you have nothing to do with it, sure.
when we were kids at that camp, there were feral cats that were all over the place.
Ah, the golden summers of a sociopathic youth.
I know where he buried them.
okay. Show me.
if my brother has something to do with this,
I will help you in every way I can.
a 14-year-old girl is buried alive in a box and running out of air.
does that sound familiar?
of course, but my brother's in prison.
so where were you last night?
at home with my wife.
Really? What were you doing?
I ate, exercised, took a shower...
Kensi? - Yeah.
Andre says he was home with the wife last night.
I'll see what I can do.
just wanted to say sorry for all of this.
thank you. - The boys are okay?
if you don't mind me asking, was your husband home last night?
Yes.
absolutely not.
he might be a lot of things, but Andre couldn't do something like that to a young girl.
I agree. I don't think he did it, but I don't think he was home last night either...
and I bet you'd like to know where he was.
was your husband home last night?
wait, I didn't give you my answer.
Yeah, you did.
go.
she didn't say it, but Andre didn't come home last night.
got it. - What'd you eat?
I mean, I can't remember.
your wife just gave you up, told us you weren't home last night.
I'm sorry, my mistake.
you're right, I was at work all night.
and now for those magic words:
I want a lawyer.
was anyone else with you? - Conversation over.
guys, Andre was at work.
I tracked his cell phone; it was there all night.
I don't buy it. - Yeah.
so his phone was in a drawer.
I want witnesses or camera confirmation.
okay.
Andre's lawyer is going before a judge.
he's trying to get an order of release.
we can't hold this guy forever.
Andre is a flight risk. He's got money.
he may go to a country with no reciprocity, and we'd never get him back.
let's go, I want everything monitored
phones, credit cards, everything.
why are we on this case?
the FBI is welcoming our assistance. - Hetty.
I respect Sam's privacy, I do, but I need to know what's going on.
he never said anything.
in our line of work, we're all haunted by nightmares.
stay close to your partner.
Andre was at work, but then look.
his phone and car stayed at work.
he took a company car.
but not the black Malibu. - Eric, give me Sam.
sat coms work in the woods. That's good news.
got Deeks for you. - Go.
Sam, you need to get out here now.
let's go.
any other sites?
you should ask my brother-- these are his.
you seem to be enjoying the attention. Give me the keys.
take a walk with me.
Hey, man!
where are you taking me? Where are we going?
you either tell me where there's another site, or I tell everyone how you went for my gun, and I was forced to defend myself.
Yeah.
Yeah, come to think of it, there were a few other sites Andre used to bury the animals.
show me.
that's a box.
move, move, move! - Box.
get on your knees!
come on! - Stay back.
Amanda! - Keep shoveling.
I guess we found your number three, right, Lucas?
something tells me there's not gonna be a lot of brotherly love.
then let's use it to our advantage.
you're destroying my life, you know that?
I could say the same thing.
I've just spoken with the Federal prosecutor.
if Amanda Rehme is found dead, buried underground and suffocated to death, it's gonna constitute special circumstances.
why have I been brought here?
special circumstances translates to the death penalty.
you're wasting your time with me.
I know your dark side, Andre, I know what you're capable of.
but this time you can't pin it on me, because I was in prison.
I've just gotten a court order to get a DNA sample from you and compare it to the DNA found on the bodies of the first three girls.
swab him.
you sure you got nothing to say now?
he walks you up to his last victim, and you're looking at me?
he obviously has a partner.
you weren't at work last night. Where were you?
open your mouth.
which one of them did it?
we don't know. Could be neither of them.
how long does my daughter have to live?
and don't tell me you don't know.
we estimate she has about six hours of oxygen left.
Oh, God. - We're not giving up.
Andre's lawyer just showed up. He's got an order for release.
stay with the commander. One moment.
ms. Rebecca Turman has testified that she is Mr. Maragos's mistress.
Mr. Maragos was with her last night.
in light of her testimony, the judge has granted an order of release.
let's go.
why did you leave your cell phone at work and then switch cars?
don't answer.
cause his wife tracks him on his GPS.
same with the cell phone.
you just gonna let him go?
we don't have a choice.
where are you going? - To find Amanda.
keep going?
it's too far from any road to go any further.
what happened in Bosnia?
you spoke to Hetty? Then you know.
okay.
my SEAL team was
another SEAL, Brian Dickerson, was with me.
we were taken to a mass grave filled with murdered Muslims.
turned out to be a trap set by the Serbian paramilitary.
I was beaten.
Brian was shot.
they didn't want to kill us until they interrogated us.
out in the woods, there wasn't anywhere to hide us, so they buried us... in a shallow grave...
along with the other bodies.
Brian was bleeding out.
there was nothing I could do.
try to keep pressure on it, okay?
what are you doing? - Trying to get some air.
it's work... it's working a little. Try to take a breath.
the best thing I can do for you is... is die fast.
try to take a breath.
I save you...
...you save someone else.
that's how it's supposed to work.
I said, take a breath.
you would do the same for me.
I don't know how much time passed.
I lit the last match.
glad you told me.
guys. - Go.
I just found a flight plan out of Burbank.
Andre Maragos is trying to leave the country.
tell them to stop.
air traffic control has repeatedly told the pilot not to move toward the runway.
he's just gonna go for it.
7650 Sierra Hotel, acknowledge.
you are not cleared to taxi.
you are not cleared to runway eight.
stop!
he's not gonna stop!
shut it down!
shut it down!
everybody out of the plane now!
I was free to leave the country.
why'd you offer the pilot a million dollars to get you to Venezuela after the tower told you to stop?
my lawyer told me that I was free to leave.
I just wanted to get out of the country until this was over.
having a brother like Lucas has destroyed my family.
I just wanted to get away.
I'm not buying it.
Sam, we've got something.
the FBI double-checked.
all DNA on the dead girls was a rock-solid match to Lucas.
there's no DNA match to Andre.
we also got proof that Andre was with his mistress last night, because they made... a little memento.
show me what you got.
that's all you get.
could've made this last year.
no. Look.
Where's my wine?
there's a date and time stamp from the news report from last night.
he was there all night.
trust me, you do not want to watch this whole tape.
Andre was all we had.
it made sense to keep looking at him.
so we got no suspects, no idea where Amanda is.
no nothing!
Hey, take a look at this.
when he picked up the camera, he pulled off the glove, changed the M. O.
that makes sense. Glove would've been shredded from all the digging.
okay, G,hear me out on this.
what does this guy do with his gloves afterwards?
well, first thing, you would, uh, burn them, shred them;
it's full of DNA.
what if he's going fast, got careless, left a glove behind, like a box or in the dirt in the hole.
case is closed. I mean, we catch him the second we find that glove.
but there is no glove.
we don't know that.
maybe neither does the killer.
he's going fast, he's scared.
he tosses everything, only to realize he left a glove behind.
right, but he... but he didn't.
but we can make him believe that he did.
exactly. - Nice.
as long as he destroyed the tape afterwards.
well, Lucas did.
like it was in the hole and got covered with dirt.
Yeah, I can do that. - Then we show it to Andre and Lucas.
I'm telling you, this is connected to those two.
we show them that there's a glove that's been left behind.
I don't know if it was them or a partner.
whoever did it's gonna get scared and go back and get it.
and we stake out the park. It's a long shot.
we're gonna need that video fast. - I'm on it.
you see that little sucker right there?
it's a glove that got left in the dirt, and it is filled with DNA.
is this really necessary?
whoever's behind this left that little glove in the dirt.
it's filled with DNA.
what's going on? - Go in the other room.
we may not find Amanda alive, but we will find her eventually.
and when we do, we'll know exactly who did this.
sorry to bother you.
guys, Kensi slipped a GPS under the bumper of the black Malibu.
it left Andre's house.
looks like it's headed towards the western part of the park.
that's us.
the car just headed onto a road that's not even on a map.
who knows the park that well?
Rangers. Hikers, campers.
what are you thinking, Eric?
can you find me some photos from Camp Wild Forest?
uh, recent photos?
guys, that Malibu stopped. - How far, Eric?
you're closing the distance. He's a half a mile away.
I spent the last two hours organizing satellite coverage.
it's overflying and coming on task... now.
I've got a heat signature. He's moving west.
you can't get it clearer than that?
satellite's still moving into position.
we're at his car. What have you got?
Eric, what are you seeing? Is he at the burial site?
we can't move until he's right on top of it.
he might be stopping. I don't know.
Eric, should we move?
come on, Eric. We're running out of time.
okay. He stopped moving just a hundred yards west of you. Go!
there are two of them. They were moving together.
what are we looking for?
that. - Of course.
Amanda went to the camp. It was right near her house.
what?
where is she?
the boys went to the same camp as their father and uncle.
they knew Amanda.
they targeted her.
where is she?!
I'll show you.
get up!
I save you...
you save someone else.
that's how it's supposed to work.
okay, okay. You're safe. You're safe.
good job.
it's for good luck.
there's your father.
Amanda. - Daddy. Oh, Daddy.
are you all right?
I'm okay.
I love you.
well, all the signs were there.
the string of dead pets in the neighborhood, school records indicating anger issues.
boys talk? - Yeah.
they said they wanted to know what killing felt like.
apparently, Uncle Lucas paid a lot of visits to them before he went to prison;
told them that if they buried the victims alive, the feeling would last for days.
wish that was the worst thing I'd ever known.
you know what really scares me?
you mean, besides clowns?
losing my partner.
I'd hug it out with you, but, uh,
I saw you sitting on some poison oak back in the woods.
trained in wilderness survival, G.
I know what poison oak looks like.
it's on my butt, isn't it?
yes it is, Mr. Hanna, and there's nothing like a good, thick slathering of calamine.
remove your pants. I won't look.
I had to do this for Ollie North in Nicaragua.
twice.
the man really was an ass.
Mr. Hanna? Mr. Callen?
gentlemen!
excuse me...
left...
back inside! Go!
go! Go!
everybody, on the floor!
don't be a hero.
watch me close. Watch me close.
choose the two or the three, you lose.
all right, fifth time's a charm.
sorry, son, you picked the wrong one.
Hey, Dr. Seuss, keep it down.
what? The kid is nice.
the kid is corny.
Deeks is flimflamming the support staff.
no, no. What I found was an entry point to a drug ring through a low-level thug with a gambling problem.
and what I'm doing-- sharpening my skill set. Set the trap.
cause you got to captivate the mark's eyes and ears with what you're doing with your mouth, but also with your hands.
captivate, not irritate.
I'm game.
money on the wood makes the bet go good. Money out of sight, take a hike.
this I gotta see.
uncle Marty throws 'em fast. Uncle Marty here to last.
uncle Marty?
beyond creepy.
what you got?
okay. Okay. Beginner's luck. That's fine.
you know, I'm feeling lucky. Double or nothing.
Doub... double...
double or... you want to...
all right. Let's do it.
okay, no, no, no, no.
I'll... I want in on this. Let's see. We have one, two...
you know what? Just... all in.
you're going to... you want to bet all that?
because that's a lot of 20s.
all right. Okay.
you know what? Let's do it.
comin' at you hard, and I'm comin' at you fast. Uncle Marty bringing the hurt.
what you got? Hmm?
you sure?
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, it is. - Thank you.
who is the loser? Who is the loser?
but didn't... I threw it to the... - Are you the loser?
how did you not know that it...
there's a situation downtown.
x-ray was her idea.
Oh... All right, all right, yeah.
Yeah, joke's over. I need the money back, 'cause obviously, everybody's in on this but me, which makes it super... not-awesome.
the kid is nice indeed.
what are we looking at, Eric?
looks like a protest situation at a Navy recruitment center downtown.
human barricade. Protest just turned into a hostage situation.
well, here come the sharks.
...downtown hostage, and in fact,
I think that we see the SWAT team is now just getting into position.
what do we know about the guy who took the hostages?
not a guy. A woman.
you know her?
you could say that.
the woman has just been identified as a Tracy Keller, a Valley Village soccer mom.
the number of hostages is still unclear.
well, this is weird.
according to the military database, there's no Tracy Keller listed as next of kin.
that's because the name's an alias.
an alias for who?
my ex-wife.
we were in the CIA.
we went undercover as husband and wife.
anything we should know?
she's smart.
not just good grades. I mean, other level intelligence.
iq's over 140.
Mmm, not that smart.
she must have missed the sniper awareness course.
Yeah, Nell's right.
she's putting herself at risk of a sniper's bullet with all that window gawking.
almost like she's posing for the cameras.
she seems way too hot for you.
what? I'm... I'm just saying.
you keep in touch? - No.
she retired last I heard. That was five years ago.
undercover agents don't retire.
they just go deeper.
you guys ever consider putting a bell around her neck?
many people have tried, Mr. Deeks.
how does she hear that?
the question is, if she retired five years ago, why is she using her old alias?
because that's a Navy recruitment center, and somehow she's figured out I'm NCIS.
she's trying to contact me.
or she's taken a recruitment center hostage.
No."Tracy Keller" was her alias only when we went undercover.
she looks like she's running away from home.
you got this?
I'm good.
don't take candy from any strangers.
what's her real name?
I only knew her as Tracy.
what happened between you two?
long story.
give me the short version.
if she wasn't central to this case, I'd let it go, but since she is, if there's something I need to know...
let's just say she's the kind of person that chooses the mission over her partner.
all right, well, let me get the lay of the land, see what I can dig up.
maybe "Uncle Marty" can hustle LAPD into letting us take over.
I'll take Kensi.
okay, cool, but I just need to get some of that money back that I...
never going to happen.
what do you want, Deeks? I'm busy with a situation here
this is Agent Callen, NCIS.
my men are already in position.
I may have some inside information on the suspect.
at least let me make first contact.
she's not communicating.
as soon as I get the orders, we're going to breach.
you got ten minutes.
if you're still in there when we breach, I'm not responsible.
done.
I owe you.
what did you say to him?
Ah, there's this little rule about not dating the captain's daughter.
he broke it.
tough perimeter to enforce. Plenty of holes if we want to get in.
no need.
Deeks came through.
the kid is nice.
condescension noted.
it's for her protection, not mine.
I'm still upset over her getting the dog in the settlement.
what's the distress word?
I always loved that dog.
you ready, Eric?
ready. Nell?
I'm good.
here we go. Three...
two...
one.
What?!
we, uh... Wait, we lost signal. - We're down, you guys.
you got 30 seconds till they're back online again.
camera phones in the crowd?
too far away for anyone to get a high-res image.
well done, Mr. Beal.
you, too, Ms. Jones.
still fashionably late, I see.
Hello, Tracy.
you look good.
Yeah, having a shotgun pointed at me tends to bring out my natural glow.
sorry.
had to make sure.
I haven't seen you since... - Uzbekistan.
heard you retired.
sort of.
did a stint with the Bureau.
now I'm in the private sector.
so, all this to get my attention.
why didn't you just call, text?
and hostage situations are all the rage?
given my current situation, it was the only way I knew how to contact you.
what situation?
whatever happened to us? Huh?
we used to be great together.
my meticulous planning, paired with your gift of improvisation.
we were unbeatable.
I absolutely agree.
we were great, until you hung me out to dry.
you never let me explain.
explain what?
it was a crappy thing to do to your partner.
to me.
I don't quite remember it that way.
but regardless...
I need your help.
whenever you're ready.
you have to know, I didn't have a choice.
they're hunting me.
who?
the United Brotherhood Party.
they chased me in here.
the white supremacists?
I'm gonna need your earwig and your cell phone.
don't do it, G.
Kensi, Deeks, we're blind.
setting up the laser mic now.
just so you know, my boss is going to bill you for that.
I was working undercover, trying to recoup a shipment of stolen Spike missiles from the Brotherhood.
the plan went awry, and now they're trying to kill me.
undercover for who?
like I said, private sector.
so why don't you just call your people, have them bring you in from the cold.
because right now, I'm not sure who I can trust.
and you think you can trust me?
I could always trust you, Callen.
Yeah.
that's me.
trustworthy.
I'm sorry I can't say the same.
gonna need something a little more tangible.
there's a warehouse-- Fourth and Hill.
dead Brotherhood member shot twice in the chest.
that should be tangible enough, huh?
go. - Sam, there's a body.
fourth and Hill. Kensi and Deeks are on the way. G...
you trust her?
not sure.
what happened at the warehouse?
I was following up a lead.
next thing I knew, bullets were flying.
had to shoot my way out.
used to be a better shot.
back in the day, they'd all be dead.
back in the day, I used to have a partner I could depend on to have my back.
so, uh, how far do you think Callen and this Tracy lady took their whole "pretending to be married" thing?
I don't know, use your imagination.
on second thought, don't.
Mm-- too late.
wait, so just out of curiosity...
what happened to your last partner?
he met an unfortunate end.
sorry to hear that.
go.
how many partners have you had?
Why?
you know, just wondering.
just wondering if you're, like, the Elizabeth Taylor of partners.
Deeks... - What?
focus.
well, I'm trying. I just think I have the right to know if you got, like, partner poison or something, right?
I mean, do they call you ＂Kiss of Death Kensi＂
or ＂Bad-Luck Blye＂
or-- I don't know-- "The Widow Maker"?
dead guy, Deeks.
see, that's-that's not funny.
not you, you idiot.
Yeah, dead guy.
well-dressed dead guy.
reminds me more of the guy that denied me a jet-ski loan than a white supremacist.
that's because he's not.
he's FBI.
Callen, we've got a body here.
took two center-mass, but he's not a member of the Brotherhood.
he's FBI.
special Agent Rick Timmons.
okay, thanks.
they find the body?
just like you said.
except he wasn't a white supremacist, he was FBI.
agent Rick Timmons.
tell me you didn't know he was FBI.
I didn't know.
not for sure.
if you want my help, I need the truth! Now!
three weeks ago, my ex-partner at the FBI was killed in a shoot-out while investigating the Brotherhood.
and now the Bureau says they don't have enough evidence to charge anyone.
what, so you're doing your own private sector investigation?
we were partners.
just partners?
it's been a long time since I let anyone get that close.
why, you don't believe me?
I saw the surveillance footage. You weren't followed.
you don't know that for sure.
you have to help me get out of here.
I can take you to our safe house.
discuss your options.
no, no, that won't work. They'll find me there.
that's the deal, take it or leave it.
guess I'll leave it. - I guess I can't help you.
if I step foot outside, they'll kill me.
please, Callen.
okay.
I'll stay.
let the hostages go.
got the floor plans, Eric. Thanks.
you NCIS?
agent John White, FBI.
Sam Hanna. FBI taking over?
no, it's a federal building, but LAPD is already in place.
we don't want to open any windows during the transition.
I've got a man in there.
Yeah, you want to tell me how?
our guy worked with her once.
you missing any of your agents?
as a matter of fact...
found a body four blocks from here with FBI credentials.
that's Agent Timmons.
his wife just had a kid.
woman inside says she shot him in self-defense.
want to tell me what this is about?
real name's Tracy Rosetti. Former FBI.
we're pretty sure she's connected with an arms dealer on the watch list
this is a delicate situation, Agent Hanna.
we can't afford to screw it up.
my guy managed the release of the hostages.
take that kind of screwup any day.
I'm going to suggest we breach. I'll give you a heads up so you can get your man out.
appreciate it.
who's the suit?
G's running out of time.
that was awesome. I wasn't even sure it would work. We make a good team.
what have you got on the arms dealer-- Mason?
James Thomas Mason, international arms dealer.
suspected involvement in the Tuareg rebellion in '07, Andean diplomatic crisis in '08, and for arming both sides of the Mexican drug war.
looks like he entered the country three days ago, but Homeland lost his tail shortly after.
well, assist Homeland in finding him.
I'm on it. - What did you find on the Spike missiles?
Mason is rumored to be responsible for a shipment of Spike missiles that were hijacked from China Lake.
it's the smallest guided missile in the world, but it packs a big punch.
easy to deploy and versatile.
a gunner at a remote location can switch targets or abort an attack while the missile is in flight.
each missile uses a computer-coded SIM card to program targeting, making the missiles accurate to within inches.
in the wrong hands...
Callen and Sam getting this information?
streaming live to their smartphones.
there's an LAPD SWAT team out there ready to take you out.
can't be worse than what's already out there.
what are they waiting for? - Me.
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt, for now.
just like old times, huh?
me, you and...
what was the name of that mangy old dog you loved so much?
Kensi, Deeks, shooter on the roof opposite! Take the front!
Eric, I need a back door out of here fast.
his name was Buddy.
uh, FYI, SWAT is breaching.
Callen? - Got it.
we gotta move.
fast.
federal agent!
he's LAPD.
you killed a cop!
back up! Back up! - Back up, guys! Back up! Take it easy...
take it easy, guys! Guys, calm down.
settle down. - Screw you, Deeks.
your buddy shot one of ours.
I did not shoot this guy.
are we good?
I'm good. They're the ones with the problem.
powder burns.
come here.
tissue damage from perforations of unburned grains of gunpowder.
this guy was shot at close range.
I was at least 50 meters when I took the shot.
took the shot from there.
I missed.
the shooter got away.
I didn't shoot your man, guys.
target not acquired. There's no one in there, sir.
what do you mean, no one's in there?
she's gone, sir.
thought your guy was good.
I never said that.
he thinks he's good. He's really not.
as soon as you hear from him, call me.
if he's still alive.
will do.
nice move.
you run into any resistance?
just from her.
a little reluctant to give up her weapons.
you sure know how to pick 'em.
she was right about one thing.
somebody wants to take her out.
how do you want to handle it?
like a hostile divorce hearing.
last chance.
you either tell us everything or we turn you over to the FBI.
I already told you everything.
I want my stuff back.
you know, for a person with such a high IQ, you're not being very smart.
have it your way.
Sam, call Agent White.
tell him where he can find her.
wait.
the FBI was running an undercover sting based on a tip that they received.
but it was bigger than anyone realized.
the Brotherhood was trying to buy a shipment of stolen Spike missiles from an arms dealer.
Mason acquired the Spikes, but he didn't have the computer-coded SIM cards needed to activate them.
without the SIM cards, the Spikes are useless.
with them, they're worth millions.
the agents running the sting pulled some strings to get the missing SIM cards.
plan was to sell them to Mason and retire with the money.
how many agents we talking about?
at least three.
and you know this how, Tracy?
you know me.
I will stay here all night.
one of the agents was Walter Stone.
my ex-partner.
he engineered the whole thing.
why didn't you tell us this...- Hence the ten-year rule?
you should always know your partner for at least ten years prior to marrying them.
you date me for a decade, you deserve my hand in marriage.
that sounds so much more like a punishment than a reward.
did it just slip your mind to mention that your FBI boyfriend was involved in an illegal arms deal?
Hey, I was trying to figure things out.
I know how this looks.
I just needed time to think.
where are the SIM cards now?
Walter had them.
I found them in a warehouse they were using as a meeting place.
as I was leaving, I was attacked and I had to shoot my way out.
I didn't know who to trust, so I turned to you.
need the names.
all night, Tracy.
agent John White.
he was the one who shut down the investigation into Walter's death.
you got proof?
my word isn't good enough for you?
white needs the SIM cards to complete the arms deal.
where are they, Tracy?
they're in a safe place.
they're the last bargaining chip I have, Callen.
if White needs the SIM cards to complete the deal, why try to kill the one person who knows where they are?
assuming she's telling the truth, White either found the SIM cards, or he panicked and tried to take her out before she started talking.
Hey, you guys got a moment?
little busy, Eric.
you're gonna want to see this.
I grabbed the security footage off...
a database that you guys are better off not knowing about.
it's taken from the roof opposite the recruitment center.
that's the LAPD sniper.
it's Agent White.
she was telling the truth.
that'd be a first.
guys, hang on.
white doesn't know we're on to him.
need to draw him out.
the code cards get us White.
white gets us Mason, the arms dealer.
Mason gets us the missiles.
you have proof.
surveillance cameras.
you're going to contact White.
tell him you have the code cards and you want to make a deal.
convince him you gave us the slip.
done.
and then you're going to tell us where the cards really are.
our wedding song.
you got married to Lee Williams and the Cymbals?
it was a fake wedding, okay?
getting pretty sunny out here.
you want me to, uh...? - You can't put any sunscreen on me.
how did you...?
guys, heads up.
here comes White.
keep your hands where I can see 'em.
you miked?
no.
I've been going over this whole thing in my head. - Get in the water.
now!
there goes her mic.
Yeah, but her hotness meter just went up, like, a jillion points.
do we have a laser mic?
it wouldn't work. Too much distortion from the crashing waves.
Kensi, can you read 'em?
I lost the visual.
I'm moving in.
you and Timmons killed Walter so you could keep the money.
it's an interesting theory.
actually, Timmons was next.
you took care of that for me.
it's too bad Walter never told you where we were meeting Mason.
you could have retired in comfort.
where are the damn codes?
federal agent!
No!
what the hell, Tracy?
he killed an FBI agent and a cop.
world's a better place.
I disarmed him. There was no threat.
Walter said he always carried a backup in an ankle holster.
you can believe what you want, but he was going for that gun.
you're wrong.
with White dead, there goes our meeting with the arms dealer.
maybe not.
here.
San Pedro, container yard, 3:00.
we've got an hour if you want to recover those missiles before they figure out how to use them on some federal building.
we better hurry.
now that's the man I married.
what do you have in mind?
we go in as Walter and Tracy. - How do we know Mason hasn't already seen these guys?
Walter said Mason was unpredictable.
he didn't trust anyone.
identity was a concern, so they handled all communication electronically.
it's a risk we're going to have to take.
works for me.
not you.
just like old times.
the service road from the south is the likeliest entry point.
it runs parallel through the entire property.
okay. Fanning out from the east is gonna give us the best shot to cover the yard.
it's a maze.
testing. Testing.
care to help a girl out?
the coded SIM cards to arm the missiles were where Tracy said they would be.
impressive.
now we just have to keep them out of Mason's hands.
can I talk to you for a second?
is he gonna be okay?
you worry about Deeks. G's cool.
what? I'm cool, too.
I appreciate you trusting me back there.
that's what partners do.
I never stopped caring.
I tried to reach you.
you never let me explain.
you made it pretty clear where your head and your heart were at.
I was young... ambitious.
I made a mistake.
one that I regret.
it doesn't matter anymore.
remember when we used to talk about getting away from it all?
just you and me on some remote island...
buddy hated the beach.
Mason knows his stuff-- restricted airspace, no surveillance-- it's a virtual blind spot.
be sure to have some heavy-duty muscle backing him up.
he'll want to verify the codes work.
which means the missiles will probably be someplace close.
nobody makes a move until we've confirmed he's got them.
we good?
let's go, Tracy.
how we looking, Sam?
lot of blind spots.
gonna have to reposition to get a line of sight.
Kensi, Deeks, see if you can get a bead on those Spike missiles.
Roger that.
heads up. We have company.
expecting trouble?
you're the one who brought the backup.
Yeah, well, you never know who you can trust these days.
still, it never ceases to amaze me that when meeting an arms dealer, people invariably bring arms.
agent White not joining us, then?
he's tying up a few loose ends at the Bureau.
we have the SIM cards.
down to business.
I like that.
may I?
I'd like to, uh...
kick the tires, so to speak, if you don't mind.
be my guest.
Cheers.
the money transfer?
easy.
a bunch of blinking lights doesn't mean this thing actually works.
give me a minute to find out.
nice coveralls.
yo, Johnny!
I gotta show you this card trick that Charlie just showed me.
ain't no Johnny here, man. - He's supposed to be here.
anyway, I'll show you anyway, 'cause it's amazing.
federal agent. Shut it down.
shut it down.
put your hands behind your head.
Sam, we've got the missiles.
okay, Kensi, stand by.
I want to give this a real test.
Sam, what's going on?
I'm okay. Hold your position.
you see that?
the container on either side are barely charred.
the target's vaporized.
you happy?
would you like to do another million-dollar test?
quite happy.
I do hope Agent White is able to tie up his loose ends.
here you go.
money transferred to the agreed account.
pleasure doing business with you.
likewise.
you two make a cute couple.
let's just try one more, shall we?
I switched out the SIM card for fake ones.
Oh, dear.
there seems to be a malfunction.
I'm disappointed.
federal agent!
federal agent! Stop the car!
tires or driver?
tires.
out of the car!
put your hands behind your back!
so, what happens now?
we try and recover the money.
offshore account. Good luck with that.
you have to let me walk away.
you know I can't do that.
come on. You got the missiles.
I got closure.
not a bad settlement.
I let you walk out of my life once.
you owe me.
can't wait to hear Hetty's debriefing on this one.
grand CAYMAN ISLANDS
never vacationed in the Caymans.
always working.
working now?
afraid so.
how?
white's cell phone.
the one you took off his body.
we dusted it for prints.
white's weren't on 'em, yours were.
you switched them.
we've been tracking you since you left the scene.
just needed enough time for you to clear the cash.
you know.
I never did apologize for what happened.
forget about it.
when we tripped that alarm and you offered to hold the guards off, - I thought we were on the same page. - So did I.
why do you think I searched for you?
I went in worried you were dead.
imagine my surprise to find you at the safe house, sipping tea.
we both knew that that mission was bigger than either one of us.
not for me, it wasn't.
I never would have left you.
it was the only way. - No, there's always another way.
well, I guess that's the difference between you and me.
you know...
we could start over.
my real name is... - Rosetti.
nice boat.
alright. Slow down. Where's your cab?
Yeah, I'm walking out right now.
no, I don't see it. - I'm out front.
gotcha.
Michael, thank God. - What's going on? You okay?
Adam wanted me to give these to you.
he said you'd know what to do with them.
what is this? - I don't know, I haven't opened it.
Oh my God. It's those men.
Jillian, calm down. Did Adam tell you anything else?
no. Do you know them?
Yeah, I know them.
Oh, my God.
run, run! - Michael!
okay... Kensi, don't let him crowd you.
watch his shoulders, he's telegraphing.
I thought you were on my side.
I don't take sides. - Then stop coaching.
okay.
circle to his outside. - I thought we were partners.
we are, but I'm having second thoughts.
it's a tie. Again.
way to go, Kens.
thank you. - Tough girl.
I went easy on her. - Oh, please.
what's up, Deeks?
got a shooting at the Federal Building.
what are you kids doing in here?
training. - For what, Piratefest?
well, you're welcome to challenge Captain Blye anytime you want.
she just bested Sam, ten to three.
Really?
did you go easy on her? - No.
Really? - No!
Kensi? With a knife?
Oh, my...
okay. I'm coming. That really hurts.
the shooting victim was a State Department employee named Michael Barnes.
45 years old, served in the Marines.
he's worked in intelligence in Iraq from '03 to '05.
looks like he transitioned into a low security clearance desk job at State five years ago.
not the kind of gig that would get you shot.
maybe someone from his past was after him?
this is the only security footage I've been able to access.
I'm assuming the shooter was dressed as a police officer, and not really LAPD?
motorcycle was reported stolen yesterday.
he was protecting the woman.
freeze it. Right there.
maybe he left a print on that barricade.
I'll see what my guys can pull.
that leaves the question, who's the woman, and what's in the envelope?
according to his cell phone activity, - Same woman. - What else do we know about her?
she's a nurse at a cosmetic surgery center in Beverly Hills.
I got an address on Roxbury.
no one's here. - But the front door was open.
Dr. Russell? Federal agents!
clear, Sam.
found the doctor.
all right, I just heard back from Forensics.
the print on the concrete barrier belongs to a man named Assan Rafiq.
he is a known Somali Al Qaeda member, and on the FBI's wanted list.
I'm sending the file right now.
the only problem is the photo on file looks nothing like the shooter at the Federal Building.
so we got a dead plastic surgeon...
and a shooter whose prints don't match his face.
he came here to have facial reconstructive surgery.
question is, why?
found an operating room schedule.
Dr. Russell blocked out surgery times on days when the clinic was closed.
and I've got a dozen patient files with no insurance information or before and after photos.
the doctor only saved them on his hard drive, not the office database.
see if you can match these patients to the surgery times.
if Assan got his face changed to avoid detection, there could be others.
Sam, check this out.
looks like the woman at the shooting, Jillian Leigh, married the boss.
she's still using her maiden name.
classic sign of resistance.
maybe she liked the last name better.
trust me. It's a sign. You know what's weird?
your views on marriage?
Jillian nearly got killed delivering that envelope.
what's her connection to Barnes and the State Department?
I got something.
four patients off the list came in after hours for their surgeries.
I've accessed their medical records, but there are no before and after photos listed.
all within a four-week period.
so it's not just Assan.
this could be a terrorist cell.
I wonder how many tummies you have to tuck to afford a place like this.
alarm is on.
I'll call Eric, have him do his thing.
I think I got it.
have you done this before?
watch and learn. Hold that for me, please.
Oh, my God! Deeks!
it's not so funny when someone gets shocked, is it?
that was not very nice.
are you pouting?
do you have any idea what you're doing?
we're in. - Wow. How very Lady MacGyver of you.
I hot-wired a Cessna once.
Why? Seriously?
why would you need to hotwire an airplane?
got it. - Ah, nice.
expensive taste.
I'm guessing Jillian didn't come home last night.
nothing seems disturbed.
no kids in the picture.
man, that's the way to do it, huh?
no nannies, no tuition, no braces...
just a whole lot of disposable income.
Jillian left her e-mail account up.
no messages sent since last night...
nothing unusual in her inbox.
no calls on her cell phone since the shooting, according to Eric.
she met her friend, Barnes...
he gets killed, she gets shot at.
killer takes off with the incriminating envelope.
that's a rough morning. - Yes, it is.
what do you do after that?
guilty or not, she's in the wind.
Oh, there it is! L. A. diet.
energy drinks, collagen, and Juvaderm. Wow.
it looks like they're affiliated with the Malibu Medi-Spa. - What's that?
the most exclusive inpatient post-op surgery center where privacy and discretion are of the utmost importance.
or so it says. - Right.
they've even got an anti-paparazzi helicopter tent.
Really? - Yeah.
that's a good place to hide out.
Eric, surveillance cameras at Dr. Russell's building.
check these dates and times.
see if we can't catch these guys heading in for their surgeries.
Russell's calendar.
nothing unusual this week.
a car appointment for his Mercedes.
out-of-town wedding in Sonoma.
what's this? G. D. 2 p. m.November 3.
someone's initials? - Maybe.
all the other appointments list the full names.
I'll run a vector with Dr. Russell's address book and phone records, see if anything matches.
I'll also see if anything comes up on his wife's laptop.
and look for any connections to Michael Barnes.
we need to find out why Jillian was taking that envelope to him.
you think Jillian's hiding something?
I think she's scared.
she saw a cop kill her friend and try to shoot her.
I don't blame her for laying low.
thank you.
I'm your manager. You were in a boy band.
you need some work done before making your big comeback.
okay, I was the magician's assistant last time, so, no.
why don't we just show our badges and search the place?
are you kidding? Jillian is a flight risk.
we can't take any chances.
she's probably got friends in there, hiding her out.
can I help you?
Yes, hi, I'm Kenley Banks, and this here.
her manager. I am her manager. I am Danny Collins.
and this is my client, Kenley. Or, as I like to call her, Kiki.
you may recognize her from the girl band The Panther Girls, otherwise known in Colombia as Las Chicas Panteras.
they're huge down there. Big audience.
and we hear that you're the very best.
also private, and we don't need anybody, you know, Tweeting about her upgrades.
Oh, absolutely not.
we're gonna need the works, though, I think, yeah?
probably a booty lift, a tummy tuck, micro-lipo to the hips-o.
basically, we're going to need a overhaul to the whole...
undercarriage, here.
of course.
and then we'll deal with the head, and we'll do the nose. Again.
hopefully they'll get it...
they'll get it right this time. And then these little guys.
those little guys right there. What? What's that? Huh?
Oh, it's Dumbo, and he's calling because he can't fly without his ears, so he wants them back.
let me see what I can do about a tour.
okay. Great. Thank you.
micro-lipo on the hips-o"?
I was just being creative, you know. I didn't even say anything about your.
don't. Stop it. Just stop it. - What? I didn't say anything.
that's my point, I didn't say any... - Don't! Don't even
this is Lisa. She's going to be showing you around.
Hi, Lisa.
that's great.
I accessed the camera footage from the hallway in Dr. Russell's office building,
you won't believe what I got.
meet Masood Davi, Fowad Zachari, Abdul Talwar, and our old friend Assam Rafiq.
all members of the Mogadishu-based terror cell the "Chutanis."
Chutani means "devil" in Arabic.
they're on the FBI's wanted list for murder, money laundering, extortion-- among other things.
Yeah. But these are their old faces.
aside from Assan, we have no idea what they look like now.
there's one person that does.
this is the Relaxation Center.
all of our meals are catered by the Beverly Hills Culinary Institute.
they developed a very special liquid diet for us.
Kiki here loves liquid diet, don't you?
over here we have our mineral baths.
we import all of our water from the French Alps.
uh, hey. So what's over there?
Oh, that's our private wing.
only VIP patients and doctors allowed.
Oh, hey, listen, I should probably take this. This is her publicist.
and she goes positively bananas when I screen her calls.
we don't allow cell phones in this area.
that's okay, you can-- I'll catch up, Kiki.
you just go on ahead without me. - Yeah, go, yeah.
and I'll go grab this. Hey, babe! Listen, so, uh...
we just wanted to let you know that the, uh, the plan here with the photo shoot with the, uh, baby...
I'm so, I'm so sorry.
I'm not, I'm not even looking. I just
no, no no, I'm not looking! I'm actually a police officer, so this is
you're a pervert! - No, I'm actually not a perv, I'm just
Hey, get out! Security!
I just.- I.
is that pepper spray?
Kensi? Kensi? - What... ?
there's been a big spike in chatter related to Assan Rafiq's cell.
any specifics? - Not yet.
but often a spike like this happens just before they go operational.
a target and a timeline would help.
terrorists often choose a specific date to help sell their message.
like 9/11.
theorists believed that Bin Laden chose the date to commemorate the day when 20, 000 Muslims were killed in 1697.
Nell, see what you can pull up about the Chutani group...
any dates of historical significance.
whatever they're planning has got to be big, otherwise they wouldn't have gone to all this trouble.
Oh, got something here.
five years ago, NATO forces took out their leader,
abib Chutani, in a bomb attack.
on what date? - October 26. Which would be...
today.
I'm mixing it up.
I think I found something.
I guess I'll see if anything's come up on Jillian.
I think I'll give Director Vance the heads up.
if this terror cell is activating,
Los Angeles may not be the only target.
this is Bert Hindley.
LAPD interviewed the parking attendant on duty this morning at Dr. Russell's office building.
he remembers seeing a silver Escalade with a surf rack leaving around the time of the murder.
there's got to be more than one silver Escalade with a surf rack in L. A.
dozens. But it was his bumper stickers that really sealed the deal.
he picked up his third DUI last month.
he's currently serving time.
he sold his wheels on Craigslist before he went in.
you got the new owner's name or address?
DMV hasn't updated its records, but I've got an IP address that the buyer used on Craigslist.
so the guy's address is...
650 Flower Street, downtown.
unit number?
not yet. But...
Oh, come on. There's, like, ten people in the country that could have done this.
ten, huh?
can you get us their names? Maybe one of them can get us the unit number.
you know, that-that hurts.
hold this, Eric.
I'll get you that bumper sticker vector when you get back.
and I will text you that unit number.
I got it.
what happened to you? - I got peppered.
Peppered? Any luck with Jillian?
Yeah, yeah. I found her. He lost her.
don't want to talk about it.
he left a trail of angry, violated women in Malibu.
Gloria Allred might be calling, just so you know.
okay, that was a gross exaggeration-- peppered.
did you find anything?
Yeah. Just got a hit off Jillian's ATM card.
she used it at a rest stop off the I-5 South in Irvine.
Ooh. Pepper spray.
he doesn't want to talk about it. - I don't want to talk about it.
see who she knows in the area. Already on it.
I'm data mining through her school records, address book, e-mails, phone calls and calendar appointments.
if there's anyone in the area that Jillian's had any contact with, this will pick it up.
this doesn't make any sense.
why would a successful surgeon get involved with these terrorists?
well, you saw their place.
maybe he needs some extra cash-ola for another Picasso.
okay, looks like our winner is...
david Fernandez, registered nurse at St. Mary's Hospital.
uh, lives two miles off the exit she was at.
address is 465 Sheridan Road. - Got it.
Oh, and I figured out what "G. D." stands for in Dr. Russell's calendar.
Dr. Georgia Donner. She's an OB/GYN at Cedars.
I don't know too many guys that visit a gynecologist.
the fact that you actually know any scares me.
maybe he went with his wife. Maybe Jillian's preggers.
you really are a detective. - Okay, now you're just making fun of me.
Eric came through. It's unit 1231.
I don't get the whole loft craze thing. If I buy a place, I want walls.
I like the open floor plan.
you know where everything's at. - You know where everything's at because all you own is a sleeping bag and a toothbrush.
and I got a roof over my head. What more do I need?
a sweet plasma, for one.
microwave, bookshelves...
then I got to buy books.
that's how it starts.
first you buy paperbacks, a fridge, a bed...
just kind of snowballs on you.
something tells me they don't like visitors.
you know what else paranoid people don't like?
please proceed to the nearest stairwell.
do not take the elevators.
please proceed to the nearest stairwell.
do not take the elevators.
please proceed to the nearest stairwell.
federal agents. Stop!
on him!
federal agent. That's far enough.
don't even think about it.
come back in, man.
you don't want to do this.
it's not worth it.
Allahu Akbar!
anti-anxiety meds, tranquilizers, sleeping pills...
all the labels ripped off.
it's a high-stress job being a terrorist.
never know when your shoe might blow up or you got to drive your pickup into a hotel foyer.
no sign of the envelope from the Federal Building.
you were a mathlete.
junior Math Olympian.
it's a big difference. We don't wear the jackets.
some sort of code for a safe, lockbox...
one for Nell.
it's a tourist map of Long Beach.
I doubt they were buying souvenirs to bring back to Somalia.
routes all along the waterfront are highlighted.
so, we got a dead Al Qaeda member, a dead former intelligence agent, a dead plastic surgeon...
and three terrorists with new faces on the loose.
the one person who can ID them is doing her best to disappear.
okay, so let's assume their target is in Long Beach.
we don't know where. - We don't know when.
Yes, we do.
travel itinerary.
four seats booked to Jakarta, departing from LAX.
when? - Tonight.
it's a pretty serious hobby.
takes my mind off things.
some people do yoga. I stuff animals.
thank you.
you and Jillian worked together at St. Mary's?
six years.
it was her first job out of nursing school.
I was her supervisor. Is she in trouble?
uh, right now we just want to ask her some questions.
I wish I could help, but it's been a while since we've talked.
I was at her wedding two years ago, and she sent me a card for my birthday back in April.
we talked around then.
did you spend much time with Dr. Russell?
I only met him a few times, but Adam's a great guy, really generous.
we were so happy for Jillian when they started seeing each other.
we? Are you married?
was. Divorced a year next month.
Oh. Girlfriend?
working on it. Started online dating, but "male nurse seeks woman who loves taxidermy" isn't really luring the ladies.
that's their loss, man,'cause that's a sweet raccoon.
anyway, thank you so much for your time.
sorry I couldn't have been more help.
no problem-- we have to go.
we have to go.
okay. Bye.
okay, that guy was awesome. What?
ginger ale and crackers on the counter.
foods you eat when you're nauseated and in your first trimester.
or foods you eat if you like ginger ale and crackers, which I do.
Oh, my God, what if I'm pregnant?
take one of these.
prenatal vitamins?
I hear they're good for your hair.
Yeah, you stake out the front of the house, I'll take the back. Heads up.
Jillian, stop!
Jillian, stop! Jillian!
we're federal agents.
I want to speak to my husband.
I'm sorry, your husband was shot and killed this morning in his office.
no... No.
we're really sorry.
you always this stubborn?
only when I know I'm right.
what makes you so sure this won't work?
is everything copacetic here?
Yes, absolutely.
we're working on the code from the terrorists' safe house.
hmm, sort of working.
difference of methodologies at the moment.
I'm of the "let's run it through our code decryption programs" camp, and she's...
of the "let's not limit ourselves to assuming it's a code" camp.
both viewpoints are valid.
perhaps you should divide and conquer, see where you end up.
you divide... and, uh, I'll conquer.
it's decaf.
now, I know you've been going through a lot, but we need to ask you some questions, okay?
do you have any idea who was after your husband?
we know you're scared, but we're on your side.
you have to trust us.
we don't have time to win her over.
you sure you don't want me to go?
you can be a little intimidating.
I have more in common with her than you or Kensi.
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.
I'm sorry for your loss.
we're going to do everything we can to make sure you're safe.
how?
those men know what I look like.
which is why we need you to answer a few questions.
so we can find them.
look, I know you're not just worried for your own safety.
we're not going to let them get to you or your baby, I promise.
Hey, I have kids, too, I understand.
you just want to protect them.
kids-- plural?
you knew this? - Yep.
so what's the story? What's the story? That's it?
first time my daughter ate cereal,
I stood there waiting to give her the Heimlich.
a few years later when she took the school bus for the first time,
I tailed it every day for a month.
Adam and I drove into work early this morning to catch up on some paperwork.
we don't see patients on Tuesdays.
I was in my office when all of a sudden he came rushing in.
I'd never seen him look that way before.
he was... afraid...
helpless.
he said that he was in trouble and he needed me to take something to our friend Michael at the State Department.
michael was a mutual friend?
he was Adam's best friend since childhood.
michael had a hard time after he came back from Iraq, and my husband was one of the only people he confided in.
did your husband say anything else before you left?
he said he would explain everything later.
and that he loved me.
we were supposed to meet up in Westwood after I met with Michael, but he never showed up and he made me swear not to contact him or to go home, so I drove out to Malibu.
did you know what was in the envelope?
not until Michael opened it and I saw the photos.
they were all patients.
four of them had come in for major reconstructive work on their faces.
Adam said they were businessmen from Egypt.
when was the last procedure performed?
maybe three weeks ago.
I assisted on all the surgeries.
the men came in for their final checkups a few days ago.
I should have realized something wasn't right.
Adam wasn't the same after they left.
my husband never wanted me to worry about anything.
but I could see on his face, he...
he was scared about something.
you think they forced him to perform the surgeries?
it's the only way he would have done it.
they must have threatened us, and he kept it a secret to protect me.
if I just would have realized, if I just would have said something...
maybe Adam and Michael would both still be alive.
we're going to keep you in protective custody until we can make sure you'll be safe. Okay?
how's the dividing and conquering going?
so far it's just a lot of dividing and multiplying.
I've tried every mathematical model, logarithm and vector.
and I've been tracking the terrorist " data footprint
car travel, phone calls, ATM use.
the town that keeps popping up is Signal Hill.
so I drilled down using the first part of the code from the safe house and finally came up with a match Jones & Brothers Storage.
it's the largest self-storage facility in Southern California.
storage facility.
wait a second.
W257 refers to West 257th Street.
B19 is Building 19,
R7 is Row 7, U5 is Unit 5.
right, which makes the last four numbers...
the security code on the door.
let's look at the records.
it says here that it was rented out about three months ago, which is around the time we think these men came to get their facial surgeries.
just think of how much sooner you might have figured this out if you'd actually been working together.
looks like they left in a hurry.
dimethyl methylphosphonate, phosphorus trichloride, sodium fluoride.
everything you need to make sarin gas.
judging from the empty bottles, the gas tanks...
enough to kill thousands.
we know they plan on using sarin gas.
now, it works best in contained environments, so let's start with indoor venues.
they had maps of Long Beach in the safehouse.
there are three major indoor events going on tonight.
we've got a car show at the Long Beach Event Center near the airport, a Bob Fosse tribute at the Performing Arts Center, and a food and wine festival at the Grand Belmont Hotel.
no. None of those are on the coast.
they had waterfront routes highlighted.
they went to the trouble of changing their faces.
they're not going after a car show or food festival.
they've got to be planning something way bigger, somewhere with facial recognition cameras set up.
let's look at where cameras are installed along the water.
Nell, start with the marina. - Okay.
okay, where are the other checkpoints?
well, since 9/11, all the ports and docks, major hotels, the aquarium.
Nell, anything going on off-shore?
got it. It's the Queen Mary.
she's docked, but you have to go through a facial recognition checkpoint.
and there's a black tie ball going on for the Planet Advocate Alliance tonight at 18: 00.
huge guest list of VIPs.
the governor will be in attendance, foreign dignitaries, a bunch of Hollywood celebs.
all the news crews will be covering this.
hmm. Cocktails and a VIP tour of the ship started 15 minutes ago.
we evacuate now, it'll force their hand.
they'll launch an attack.
Assan and his men have to believe it's business as usual.
we've got no other choice.
if we can't rely on facial recognition software, we'll just have to do this the old-fashioned way.
let's keep it moving. Come on through!
we're ready, Sam. Time for Jillian to do her thing.
a lot of people in here. - 500, at least.
we know what Assan looks like, and one of the other terrorists who had surgery is dead.
we only need you to identify two men.
you're the only one who's seen them after their surgeries.
okay?
wait. Maybe him.
where did he go?
Eric, we've got a blind spot over here.
it's the best we can do.
there's about ten feet of dead space between the two cameras.
there.
no, no. It's not him. I'm sorry.
there's too many people.
it's okay. It's okay. Just take your time. Okay?
Jillian, Jillian. Focus on one monitor.
one monitor.
this... chemical-- it would kill all these people?
take me on board.
G, I'm coming in with Jillian.
guy by the stage taking pictures.
guy next to the stage with the camera.
no. He's not one of them. - Negative.
there. The waiter.
you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
we got eyes on a suspect at my five o'clock. Dressed like a waiter.
I'm on him.
the man with the shaved head-- on his cell.
Deeks, we got confirmation on the man on the phone, - headed to the kitchen. - Got it.
I need the layout of the ship. Where we headed?
accessing your location.
right, you're on the O-9 deck.
engine room and vent systems up ahead.
do it now! - Sam...
open the valve!
Kensi-- Assan, south exit.
I got him. Stay with Jillian.
excuse me. Sir? Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Callen, we got two dead security officers outside the ventilation room.
federal agent. Freeze!
nice shot. - Thanks. I got this, go.
federal agents! Get down! Guys, I lost him.
I mean, is it just me, or do I look really good in this?
it's just you.
I hate to admit it, but you boys look pretty sharp.
right?
Hetty's a miracle worker.
you know what we should do?
we should go out.
Oh, I'm going to get changed, go home to a bubble bath and a tub of Rocky Road.
your loss. Callen?
come on, man. Chicks really dig the James Bond look.
well, I don't think a little male bonding would hurt anyone. Sam?
somebody's got to keep you two fools out of trouble.
this is what I'm talking about.
because this is going to be awesome.
I know the perfect spot, too. We are going to make out like bandits.
gentlemen. Going somewhere?
just going to grab a little celebratory cocktail on a job well done.
just, uh, you know, compare our notes on the cases.
not in my tuxedos, you're not.
we'll only be a few hours, Hetty.
we won't get into any fights or anything.
march.
now I know how Cinderella felt with her evil stepmother.
I heard that, Mr. Deeks.
Oh, yet another beautiful morning in the City of Angels.
the traffic's light coming out of Pasadena, toward downtown, with no construction or accidents to report.
what a perfect day to commute, so, if you're driving into work, you should snap a photo for posterity's sake.
be something to show your grand kids.
what was that? Okay, we have an SUV that's just exploded.
we're gonna try to to get down. It is a scene of absolute chaos.
Max, are we getting this?
it's comparing apples and oranges.
lethal injection or firing squad.
not really fair to either of them.
I'm just saying the comparison begs to be made.
Hetty and Hunter. Pick your poison.
Hetty's more like that little pill you slip in someone's drink so they follow your every command.
those pills exist? Really?
calm down, Deeks-- they don't work on farm animals.
I trust Hetty.
can't say the same thing about Hunter.
okay, listen, Hunter's just trying to do her job.
and she's obviously isn't gonna get the love and respect that we give Hetty, so she uses other leadership tools.
right. Like secrecy. - And ruthlessness.
no problem using others to achieve her own agenda.
she is not that bad.
okay, is there a reason you keep defending her?
no. No reason. - No?
I'm just, you know, I mean, she did upgrade all the hardware around here.
Yeah. She got us those brand-new HK-416 assault rifles.
gave me a parking space.
ha! There it is. - What?!
turning traitor for parking.
no. - Traitor.
says the guy that has a five-second walk from his aggro muscle car to the front door.
Oh, quit while you're ahead, Deeks.
I'm ahead?
not even close.
hate to break up the conclave, but duty calls.
gosh, I miss that whistle.
Yeah, I didn't miss the whistle.
did you guys miss the whistle?
Nope. - Not really.
footage is from the local CBS affiliate's traffic segment.
watch the black SUV.
the driver was killed instantly by the blast.
staff Sergeant Nelson Marcos, U.S. Marine.
marcos was a combat engineer specializing in demolitions.
so what's our angle?
homeland Security? Terrorism? Espionage?
staff Sergeant Marcos was a Marine.
isn't that reason enough?
Eric, play it back at half speed.
zoom in on the blue sedan coming up on the SUV.
see that? Slowed down.
they made sure it was him before they remote-detonated the bomb.
sedan was I. D.'ing the driver.
everyone else slows down when the sedan accelerates away.
the SUV belongs to Calvin Winslow.
the Calvin Winslow?
guy runs the biggest club in L. A.
hottest people, best DJs, toughest door in town.
I mean, people spend more time behind those velvet ropes than they do inside the actual club.
or so I've heard.
the ATF suspects Winslow is using his club as a front to move small arms to the city's gangs.
looks like his former partner is about to open up his own club.
they had a falling out, and now they're competitors.
drama in clubland. No criminal records for Winslow or Baird.
all right, visit Winslow and see what he knows.
we'll check out the victim, Nelson Marcos.
I've made some operational changes.
Callen, you'll be working with Kensi, Sam with Deeks.
partner up.
I'm sure you'll all make this work.
why are you doing this?
your hostility towards me is affecting the team's work.
no, it's not. The team is doing just fine.
whatever hostility I have is not about them. It's about you.
I can't trust anybody that withholds information about my past; my life.
and yet you trust Hetty.
if I told you what was on Alexa Comescu's laptop in Romania, would that gain your trust?
it'd be a good place to start.
the Comescu family's real business is money.
clean money.
they provide hundreds of criminal enterprises all around the world with start-up loans.
and in exchange for those funds, the family gets part ownership.
I thought they were involved in human trafficking.
Yeah, they were. Along with narcotics, terrorism and counterfeit goods.
if you were a criminal looking for an investor, you'd call the Comescus.
and if your business failed?
you die.
the laptop is just the tip of the iceberg.
my investigation's still got a long way to go. It's...
your investigation?
authorized by Director Vance.
and you report to...?
there's nothing about you on the laptop, Agent Callen.
the answers that you're looking for, they...
they died with Alexa Comescu in Romania.
parking space is just a piece of asphalt.
it's not worth Sam. - You think I don't know that?
so we have to do something. - Orders are orders.
do what we're told. Make it a lot easier.
all right. You ready for the Marty Deeks crash course?
can you teach it from the hospital?
okay.
Hey. Is there something that I should know about Cal...
is there something I should know about Callen?
I know he's had a tough time with Hetty and Romania and...
he's fine. Just watch him with Hunter.
okay.
so you, uh, got any tips for me on how to housebreak an angry Navy SEAL?
Yeah, let him drive.
that's it?
don't be afraid to take the lead.
assert your authority.
let him know you're comfortable being in charge.
Really?
it's actually the only way to win his respect.
Kens? - Yeah.
so I was doing a little bit of thinking over here, and I was thinking maybe we should take my car.
Yeah, that's a good idea. We should probably take your car.
cause mine is much further. Yours is probably closer.
Yeah, good plan. We should take your car.
dead guy's house.
Yep.
I know what's wrong here.
do tell.
there can only be one alpha male in a partnership.
alpha male. - Yeah.
dominant authority figure. - Yep.
leader of the pack. - Problem is, we got ourselves a pack of two.
and how does a pack resolve this issue, Deeks?
you watch the Nature Channel, right?
pack of wolves, the alpha male maintains eye contact to assert dominance over the betas.
anybody ever tell you your left eye is bigger than your right eye?
what?
let's go, Alpha.
exactly. Exactly my point, cause I'm obviously not Beta.
just saying.
according to his Marine file, Marcos lived alone.
let's take a look around back.
federal agent!
okay, that's my face you just stepped on.
please do something stupid so my partner can shoot you.
why'd you run?
bomb.
all right, bomb squad cleared the house.
I took a look around, didn't find anything, which means that, uh, Paul Bunyan here is our best lead.
how original.
never heard that one before, tough guy.
took you down, didn't I?
Yeah, I was impressed.
no one's ever beat up the soles of my shoes with his face like that.
I know you do not want me to go alpha male on you right now.
try me. - Relax, Gigantor.
I will drop you like third period French.
you think about that.
Kensi probably doesn't need to know about that whole beating up the soles of his shoes with my face thing, right?
good talk. I'm going to go check out the blast zone.
are you okay?
I've been better.
is it Hunter?
motion sickness.
I am a great driver.
not even close.
okay, Deeks doesn't have to know you feel this way, right?
all right. Thanks, Eric. Yeah.
on our way to Winslow's when we got the news.
you and Deeks okay? - Yeah.
you car sick?
What...? No... So who's Goliath?
what's next, beanstalk jokes?
it's Charles Redman.
tell them what you told me about Staff Sergeant Marcos.
look, Nelson was my friend.
he let me crash here on nights I worked late.
worked late doing what?
cabaret hospitality specialist.
he's a nightclub bouncer.
knew that guy looked familiar.
you two know each other?
no. Last Thursday at the club tried to cut the line.
told people you starred in that vampire movie.
Kensi, that's... I was undercover there.
I was... I was following up that lead with the guy. Remember the case with the thing?
no.
you don't seem real upset about your friend's murder, Mr. Redman.
didn't know until you guys told me.
still hasn't hit me, I guess.
bomb squad just said that the, uh, shed was an explosives factory.
said they found residue of military-grade C-4.
you want to explain that to us?
I will-- if you protect me.
from who?
LAPD found the blue sedan abandoned just a few blocks from the freeway.
reported stolen 30 minutes earlier.
any link to the explosion?
there was a burn phone inside.
betting that's what they used to detonate the bomb.
anything on Redman?
well, bank records show he was telling the truth about working the door at Calvin Winslow's club.
he also did two years in the Army.
all right, let's work this guy, Eric.
monitor the interview-- track his answers. Update us on our comms.
Sam, let's find out why Redman is so scared of Winslow.
I didn't realize being a cabaret hospitality specialist was such a dangerous job.
why do you need protection from Winslow?
he's got some guys-- they've laid beatings on employees.
maybe worse.
these guys kill Staff Sergeant Marcos?
I don't know.
look, we were buddies since high school.
I got him gigs working security with me at the club when he was off duty.
marcos was driving one of Winslow's SUVs when it exploded.
Winslow chauffeurs VIP clients to the club.
he uses us as drivers sometimes.
I just received a preliminary report from the LAPD Bomb Squad.
the device that killed Marcos was of the same design as the one that took out the storage shed.
photos? - Coming up.
so what did Marcos do to Winslow?
few nights ago, I crashed at Marcos's place.
found some gear stashed in a closet.
explosives. Kind of stuff the military uses.
I confronted him, and he said he stole it.
somebody hired him to make a bomb.
Winslow? - He wouldn't tell me.
so what were you doing in that shed this morning?
I got woken up by noises. I heard somebody out back.
it was just sitting there on the workbench.
it was wired to a cell phone.
the phone's alarm was counting down. Look, I just got the hell of there.
when was the last time you spoke with Winslow?
maybe a week ago, at the club.
I'm seeing over a dozen calls to Winslow from Redman's cell phone over the past two weeks.
then explain the calls made to Winslow from your cell phone.
I told you, I didn't call Winslow.
marcos uses my phone sometimes. It had to be him.
step outside, gentlemen. There's something I need you to see.
well, clearly, he's feeling guilty.
and clearly, he's covering his own ass.
these are evidence photos of the bomb remnants from the freeway and from the shed.
your assessment, Agent Hanna.
I'd say both bombs were built by the same person.
common design elements.
same type of tape, wire.
and both bombs are equipped with two cell phone triggers.
the first phone receives a signal and triggers the blast.
the companion phone takes that signal and transmits it to other devices.
these types of bombs are designed to be used together.
it's like the first device can trigger the second, and the second can trigger a third, and so on.
it's a chain of explosions.
a chain meant for what?
to destroy something big.
you were the weird kid on the playground obsessed with fire, weren't you?
I'm just saying. - That's my assessment.
you might want to take a look at this.
marcos had security cameras at the back of his house.
the only one who went inside the shed today was Redman.
camp Pendleton's reported 12 pounds of C-4 missing from an ammo supply point, along with a crate of blasting caps.
staff Sergeant Nelson Marcos had access to that location.
paul Bunyan is screwed.
you used Marcos.
you convinced him to steal plastic explosives from Pendleton and make bombs for money.
you were the only one in that shed this morning.
marcos never called Winslow from your cell-- it was you.
so... want to start over?
Winslow killed Nelson.
but it was my fault.
Winslow knew I was ex-military, but...
I really didn't have the expertise for what he wanted.
so I told him about Nelson.
he offered us $100, 000 for five bombs rigged to cell phone detonators.
I talked Nelson into helping me.
why'd he kill him?
cause Nelson changed his mind after he found out what the target was.
what was the target? - I don't know.
he called me after he left, said he'd tell me when he got back.
said Winslow needed four bombs for the first target and one for the second.
guess he was the second.
I should have gone with him.
I knew he was having doubts.
I got my friend killed.
after I heard the news, I panicked.
when we got hired, Nelson made a sample bomb for Winslow.
that's what I used to level the shed.
you know, prints were all over the explosives, the detonators.
it just seemed like the easiest way to destroy all the evidence before the cops arrived.
four devices.
one target.
we could be looking at half a city block.
Redman seemed genuinely remorseful.
more like genuinely scared.
think we got enough to charge Winslow?
motive would be good.
the ATF has been after Winslow for years. This case needs to be airtight.
so let's bring Winslow in, apply a little pressure.
Redman's word against his, and his highly paid lawyers?
so we tell him that we know about the other four devices.
at the very least, it stops him from using them.
doesn't lock him up. - Does save lives.
what's our mission here again?
Sam... do you think that we can use Redman to get inside Winslow's organization?
if Winslow still trusts him, and if Redman's willing to work with us.
well, Redman is feeling guilty. Maybe he wants to redeem himself.
maybe.
worth a shot, then.
I need to organize some logistics with Eric first.
do that.
I'll go accompany my partner.
the ATF has had Winslow under surveillance. They've confirmed that he's got a mistress.
her name is Ashley Thomas.
I'm going to need real-time updates.
when is Hetty coming back?
good question.
Winslow's club.
so you want to rehearse?
rehearse what?
I usually run lines before an undercover op, but, you know, maybe that's just me.
want to get your hair and makeup done, too?
I'm just very committed to my craft.
I just go with the flow.
Ah, improv guy. I like it.
me, I like to get a little Method with it, you know?
but, whatever, improv's fine, too.
which one of us is the more dominant presence in this partnership?
don't think, just answer. Go.
ignore him, Redman.
you ready?
not really.
good. He'll expect you to be nervous.
that's him.
that's Winslow.
okay. Give him a few minutes to settle in, then we move.
so what's your favorite food?
excuse me?
just breaking the ice.
Kensi, we've known each other for a long time.
Yeah, but how much do we really know about each other?
we've always had Sam and Deeks as these social buffers, and I know you don't open up to anyone, but still...
you don't exactly open up to anyone, either.
Yeah, but I'm willing to try for the good of this partnership.
okay. - Okay.
I'm listening.
just stick to the case.
agreed. - Agreed. Okay.
why did Hunter split us all up?
Oh, wait, because she can.
she's too calculated to do it on a whim. She did it for a reason.
well, here we are. Ashley Thomas's unit.
I don't think she's here.
you sure we have the right address?
Yeah. Looks like she moved out.
or she never moved in.
okay. Let's go.
thanks for letting me do this.
means a lot.
what's your distress word?
good luck using that in a sentence.
okay, Eric, we're on the move.
read you loud and very clear, Sam.
you got stones, Redman.
most guys would have skipped town.
I made a mistake with Marcos.
came to set it right.
who's your friend?
don't know you.
I'm worth getting to know.
you got a problem. I can fix it.
I got a problem?
faulty equipment.
marcos called me. He said he did something to the devices so they wouldn't blow.
the one this morning worked pretty well.
he said he only did it to four of them.
the ones he planted for you.
like I said, faulty equipment.
and you can fix it.
well, I'd have to see the equipment to be sure.
it's already on-site. - Gonna cost more.
why don't you give me the location. I'll take a look.
this isn't a negotiation.
is that real?
half a pound of C4.
the detonator circuit's complete soon as I release the pressure on the switch here.
and the result?
they'll be picking up the pieces with a wet-vac.
looks like a negotiation now.
any luck with Winslow's mistress?
the apartment was a dead end.
I should be there.
agent Hanna's got the situation under control.
this device is a smaller version of the one Marcos built.
he said when the green light flashes red, the device detonates.
let me see if this works. No!
son of a...
maybe I should shoot you myself.
I altered the device. The detonation chain never reached the C4.
started and ended with the blasting cap.
that's the difference between bang and boom.
water doesn't compress, so it stops the explosion in its tracks.
you can use water as a barrier.
place the barrier on the left, it drives the blast right.
place the barrier up top, it drives the blast down.
which means? - You think you're bringing down a whole building, and you end up only damaging the floor.
or you level an entire city block.
marcos could've done this to my bombs.
looks like it's time for you to hire a professional, Mr. Winslow.
I guess I just did.
this guy Winslow has no shortage of women hanging off his arm at his club.
a different one every night.
so far, I've found only four with multiple photos taken on different days.
but none of them go by the name Ashley Thomas.
what about the ATF? They had him under surveillance.
uh, where do you think I got the photos?
I also trawled the paparazzi and various nightlife sites.
turns out, Winslow doesn't like to stray far from his own club.
social networking? - A blank.
whoever this mistress is, she's very discreet.
Eric's confirmed that Ashley Thomas's landlord received a wire transfer from a Swiss account for an amount equaling 12 months rent.
name of the account holder? - He's still working on it.
he thinks it'll take several high-level phone calls for a bank in Geneva to open up its books.
which one's Ashley Thomas?
that'd be none of them.
he's going to an awful lot of trouble to keep her hidden away.
Yeah, and I'm beginning to think we're not going to find her.
I'm beginning to think I know why.
you found her? - I don't think she exists.
my intel is solid, Agent Callen.
why'd you choose our team for this case?
Winslow's not a high-priority target.
you split us up. You sent us off chasing ghosts.
Ashley Thomas is not a ghost.
you're keeping us off balance, you're keeping us busy. Why?
what's this really about?
you need to keep looking until she turns up.
and when she doesn't...?
she will.
agent Hunter. - Hey, Sam's en route to another location.
thank you, Eric.
Sam is on the move.
give my regards to Ashley when she turns up.
I know this spot, Eric.
this is where Winslow's old partner, Thom Baird, is opening up his new club.
this has got to be where Winslow's planted the bombs.
this one of your clubs, Winslow?
no.
we're on the list.
Eric, what's the club's layout?
main entrance is on your street, service entrance around the back, several other businesses next door.
it's a big club. Lot of places to plant a bomb.
or four.
Deeks, Callen and Kensi are about to join you.
backup for the backup, that's fantastic. Do we have a plan here?
hold until Sam has located all four devices and disabled them. Then move in.
simple plan. What could possibly go wrong?
plenty.
Sam just entered the building.
Eric, is the club open?
um, no. Grand opening's in two days.
call the nearby businesses.
tell them that there's been a gas leak and they need to evacuate.
Nell, call LAPD and tell them they need to block the street to through traffic.
no lights, no sirens.
well, well, well, if it isn't my ex-partner and my current partner's ex-partner.
Where's Sam? - He's gone clubbing.
isn't that owned by Winslow's... - Ex-partner.
you couldn't resist, could you? - I couldn't.
we're gonna have to evacuate the street.
hunter's already on it-- gas leak.
well, if Winslow sees the street being evacuated, - he's gonna know something's up.
you take the front door. Soon as the street's clear, we're going in.
all right. - Deeks, stay with me.
three partners in one day.
I'm feeling all giddy.
Eric, comms up.
comms up. Callen and Kensi are patched in.
nice-looking club.
uh, is he doing what I think he's doing?
you really don't like this guy.
I made him. And this is how he repays me.
he's gonna learn the hard way.
be easier to just burn this place.
why go to all this trouble?
I want to maximize the pain.
okay, so where are the bombs?
number one.
Yep, dual cell phone detonators.
branch of an explosive chain. This should do it.
where are the others?
structural walls front, back and main stairwell. Will it work?
if you're asking if it'll bring down the building, sure.
long as it detonates.
well, that's why you're here.
you got a burn phone to activate this?
number's already entered.
well, don't pocket-dial or we'll all be dead.
perimeter. Start at the front.
Where's he going?
stretching his legs.
Callen, we've got a tourist. Heading to the front of the building.
Kensi, did you get that?
I got it.
ma'am, hurry up, please. There's a gas leak.
move away from the building. - Hey, what's going on?
gas leak. Second one this week.
I don't know.
cat's out of the bag, guys.
Kensi, is the street clear?
almost.
so much for that simple plan.
street is being evacuated. Gas leak.
now, isn't that a coincidence?
so what are we waiting for?
well, someone told the cops.
I'm gonna find out who.
the guy who did this, fixed it so it wouldn't explode.
I guess good help is hard to find, huh?
and now I found you.
talk to me, Eric.
they're in the west corner of the club. Sam deactivated the first bomb.
I'm moving in.
Callen, hold your position.
Kensi, get ready to move in.
maybe you're not who you say you are.
it was me.
the cops came to talk to me. I... might have said something, Mr. Winslow.
I'm sorry.
so am I.
Redman's down. Call an ambulance.
Kensi, move in.
for Nelson.
for Nelson.
when you don't know who to trust...
trust no one.
federal agents!
someone is using your cell phone.
shut it down!
come on, come on!
the call is relaying-- I-I can't stop it!
this one's safe; the others aren't.
Callen, get the hell out of there now!
go, go!
you okay?
you? - Yeah.
you good? - Yeah.
you? - I'm good.
Callen, status?
we're all good.
never a dull moment.
well, sounds like you just got a hit.
Callen? I found her.
I don't understand how this happened.
I did a name search with a very tight set of parameters to filter out every other Ashley Thomas in Los Angeles, and got nothing-- until now.
suddenly, her name pops up. It's like she was just born.
it's a gossip site.
story about Calvin Winslow and his mysterious new lady love...
Ashley Thomas. - And that's not the only one.
I'm now showing dozens of entries from blog sites to mainstream press.
it's like someone's doing a massive Ashley Thomas upload to the net.
you got photos?
Yeah. First one coming through now.
Calvin Winslow living the highlife on the red carpet with Ashley Thomas.
open it.
Oh... ...my God.
send this to my phone.
looking for someone, Mr. Callen?
lange, Henrietta. In case you've forgotten.
you're back.
I feel like I was never gone.
Where's Agent Hunter?
not looking for me at all, then.
she's gone on assignment. Why do you ask?
I found somebody she was looking for.
Calvin Winslow living the highlife on the red carpet with Ashley Thomas.
miss Thomas bears a striking resemblance to Agent Hunter, don't you think?
hunter was put in the picture.
she's backstopping a new alias. That's what this is all about, isn't it?
Ashley Thomas didn't exist until Hunter created her.
it's what we need to do, Mr. Callen, to go undercover.
the deeper the cover, the deeper the backstopping required.
agent Hunter saw this Winslow case as a way into a much bigger operation in Europe.
so now Winslow is dead, but...
Ashley Thomas is very much alive.
and seeing as she had quite a relationship with the late Mr. Winslow,
I'm sure she'll have no trouble convincing his friends in Europe that she can be trusted.
does this have anything to do with the Comescus?
nothing at all.
in this operation, their paths never cross.
she never had a dog in that fight anyway.
unlike you and I.
you asked me... why I went off on my own to face the Comescus.
I did it... because of your mother.
you knew my mom?
sit down. I'll tell you everything I know.
why now?
because you're safe from the Comescus now.
and because I can't hold on to these secrets any longer.
please, Mr. Callen.
where do I begin?
what was her name?
in these tough economic times, necessity is often the mother of invention.
it certainly is the case here.
because of one woman's ingenuity, the spirit of that character is alive and well on the boardwalk.
from Venice, I'm Adriana Gomez.
that was great. Okay, you were great.
the story... could have been worse.
you know, Edgar better come through with that Villaraigosa assignment.
I was wondering, you want to go to-- - You know what, Steve?
I've got to get back to the van and get my head together for the next segment, okay?
all right. I'll finish shooting some more B-roll.
no. No.
call an ambulance! Somebody!
look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It's going to be okay.
okay? You're going to be okay.
what was her name?
Clara. Her name was Clara.
I first met her in Langley, Virginia, in 1966.
liked her right away.
she had been recruited to return to Romania, and I was to be her handler.
my mother worked for the CIA?
and her father before her.
you see, Mr. Callen, it's in your blood.
her father-- your grandfather-- was George Callen.
he parachuted into Romania in 1944
to help King Michael overthrow the fascists who had sided with Hitler.
after the war, your grandfather hunted down war criminals, including the Comescu family.
that's where this all started?
Yes.
he met and married a Roma girl in 1947.
that was when the Comescus sought their revenge.
he was murdered.
she fled to America with their child.
my mother. - Clara.
she went back to Romania as a student. That was her cover.
for more than a year, everything was fine.
but then something happened.
she vanished.
six years later, she reappeared, desperate to get out of Romania with her children.
you and your sister.
she contacted me through prearranged channels.
at the last minute, they ordered me to abort the mission.
we'd agreed to meet on the beach.
so now you know why I went back.
all these years.
forgive me.
it's not going to happen.
why don't you go find a fire hydrant?
chase a cat.
what's up?
why is this mutt here?
well, I got a houseguest, and she kind of has a problem with him.
let me guess. She can't stand his begging, either.
kind of puts a damper on the fun times.
he asked.
really wouldn't kill you to share a little bit of your breakfast with him, Sam.
this is my breakfast.
I paid for it with money I worked hard for.
come on. Give Monty a break.
you know, I think you're forgetting how Monty came through with some bomb-sniffing action not too long ago.
Yeah, and after that sniff, what did he do when I put myself in harm's way?
you mean leaving the area?
he was just following protocol, Sam.
he was saving his furry butt-- that's what he was doing.
that why they retired him?
actually, the vet that did his psych eval said he had a nervous condition.
it's kind of like a canine PTSD.
puppy traumatic stress disorder?
exactly.
cool. Dog whistles really work.
case is up, guys.
stay.
sandwich better be here when I get back.
KWLJ3 reporter Adriana Gomez.
she'd just wrapped up a puff piece in Venice when she was shot and killed.
it was a drive-by.
her cameraman, Steve Downey, was still rolling when it happened.
there was also a serious side to Ms. Gomez's reporting.
what kind of serious?
enough for her to receive several death threats from Libyan nationalists.
she did a series of stories on Asad El-Libi.
he was a Libyan expat living here in L. A.
when the crisis hit, he moved back and started his own version of "Radio Free Libya
after Gaddafi shut down the Internet.
the guy is a tech wizard.
he set up a Web site that got around the firewalls.
it's become a clearing house of intel for the rebels.
no one knows who he is or where in Libya he broadcasts from, but he's become this... sort of a folk hero.
well, looks like somebody wasn't too happy that our local news station was cheering him on.
I'm still not getting why we're involved with this.
Adriana Gomez had been in contact with a Naval Intelligence officer,
commander Gavin Madison.
he is the go-to guy on Libyan affairs.
he knows more about Asad El-Libi than anyone.
he and Adriana traded phone calls.
twice the day she was killed.
if this incident compromises our national interests...
Kensi, Deeks... - And Monty.
get a FISA warrant for her files. Head over to the newsroom.
Sam and I are going to go talk to Madison.
done.
seen it all-- fires, floods.
more death than I care to remember.
you get used to it.
get the shots, grab the interview, move on to the next story.
you work with her much?
every day for the past two years. Partners.
you get pretty close to someone when you spend that much time with them.
Yes, you do.
we'd get into it a lot-- differences of opinion
but even in the middle of that, there was...
heat?
did she feel it, too?
maybe.
all right, going to need some password help here, Eric.
that's cool. Then I can, uh, read Kensi's diary.
Oh, I already did.
you do not want to go there.
did you know about the death threats?
she reported them to the cops. Lot of good it did.
is there anything you can think of? Um, someone Adriana may have been talking to?
a source, maybe?
Yeah, she had a contact-- a Libyan expat.
she met him a couple times at some Libyan restaurant.
name?
sorry.
and the restaurant?
I remember she had this Libyan dish-- liver and raisins.
Adriana would do anything for a good story.
not much in her files. A few research links, typed interview notes.
looks like her main source was Madison.
we get any notes from her call with him yesterday?
nada.
may not have gotten to it yet.
you didn't read Kensi's diary. Did you?
Hey. Did you really?
Eric? Hello?
I think you secretly like Monty. - Not a dog person.
cats? - Nope.
what if you want to get a pet? - Not going to.
fish. - Fish.
low maintenance, don't make any noise. They even poop in their own environment.
Yeah, well, you can't pet a fish.
exactly. And if things don't work out...
sushi.
commander Madison? - What do you want?
NCIS. Like to talk to you about Adriana Gomez.
sorry, not a good time.
all right.
we're just going to have to make a call-- get a warrant.
I think you know the deal.
do that.
federal agents!
any more? - No.
they wanted to know about Asad El-Libi, where he's operating from, how to find him.
I got the feeling they knew more than I did.
seen them before? - No.
Adriana Gomez called you twice the day she was killed.
Yeah, she left me a voice message. Said it was important.
what about those stories she did last month?
I just gave her some basic background. Nothing classified.
things everyone on Gaddafi's side would know about anyway.
but I think she was on to something else.
Asad El-Libi's real identity?
that or where to find him.
and for whatever reason, they didn't want her doing any more stories on him.
I guess they suspected I knew what she knew.
if you guys hadn't arrived when you did, it'd be my photo you're taking, not his.
salim Akim. He's been linked to Gaddafi's secret police.
and his partner is still out there somewhere.
partners. They started out as a quartet.
hakim Selani, Navid Mufar and Yuseff Aman.
the last one. - Yuseff.
that's the one who escaped from Madison's house.
all four came through LAX on tourist visas and counterfeit passports.
they vanished into the L. A. melting pot before the Feds could track them.
it's hard to do that without help.
maybe Yuseff and his team came here to find out where in Libya Asad El-Libi was broadcasting from.
Adriana found out where.
if she goes public with that story,
Asad El-Libi relocates and they're back to square one.
the agents are probably on their way back home to hunt him down.
we have no way to warn him because we don't know where he is.
she had a source.
right. The cameraman said he didn't have a name, but he also said that she met him at a Libyan cafe.
can't be that many of those in town.
Eric? - I'm on it.
all right, Cafe Tripoli. She had lunch there three times in the past couple months, according to her credit card records.
and Monty.
bring me back some baklava.
I mean, look at him-- he's perfect for our cover.
the young, hip couple wanting a taste of exotic Middle Eastern cuisine and our rescue dog.
it's actually a requirement for all young hip couples in Los Angeles to have rescue dogs.
there's only one hitch in your little plan there, buddy.
dogs aren't allowed in restaurants.
we've considered that, haven't we, Monty? - Have you?
he's also a service animal.
they use them for blind people, people with seizures, all sorts of things.
there's even a woman in Minnesota with an anxiety monkey.
Really?
Yeah, I read about it in Bark magazine.
do you get that? Bark magazine?
no? Their motto is "Dog is my Co-Pilot."
no? Not gonna fly?
all right, Monty, you heard the woman. You're staying here. Don't give her kisses.
Aw, really?
you're staying here and I'm going to put the radio on for you.
a little NPR, yeah? Loves All Things Considered.
finding a donor isn't all that hard.
finding out where to bike to get the best meal is.
as NPR's Joe Palca explains, scientists think they
welcome. - That's Asad El-Libi.
you know of him?
Yeah. Actually, one of our friends is a reporter who did a whole bunch of stories on him.
Yeah, she's the one who recommended this place to us.
maybe you know her-- Adriana Gomez.
Oh, yes, yes, from the local station.
Yes, exactly. She usually comes in here with a Libyan friend for lunch.
my God, sweetie, what's his name? - Oh, what is his name?
libyan guy, comes... - I cannot recall.
we'll go check on Monty, huh? - Sure.
not moving? Really?
no.
shoot.
Eric, I need you run a plate for me. Two, S as in Slayer, M as in Metallica,
a as in Anthrax, Five, Six, Four, P as in, uh...
parsnip.
Parsnip? Your lettering system is heavy metal bands and you're giving me a root vegetable for "P"?
I don't know, man, I drew a blank.
Pantera? Hello?
Oh, Cowboys From Hell. What was I thinking?
car is registered to Farag Hijazi.
he's 38, Libyan ex-pat, lives about a half mile away, off Glendon.
owns several small businesses, including a auto glass shop that closed several months ago.
which is why a large power bill last month makes no sense.
okay. Thanks, man.
they're not talking.
poison... possessed... pentagram... really, Deeks?
Com's up. We're at the auto shop, Eric.
hijazi must've had a lot of late nighters doing his books.
no computer.
there was. Ethernet, high-speed, high capacity.
like someone was running an on-line business.
or something bigger.
he never went to Libya.
Asad El-Libi's been broadcasting here the whole time.
the question is, where is he now?
Asad El-Libi uses a remote access system, so anybody tries to track his IP address will think it's coming from Libya.
so he's still broadcasting?
but something must have spooked him.
he left Hijazi's shop in a hurry.
could this be a re-broadcast?
Negatory. Asad El-Libi only broadcasts live.
Eric, can you find him?
I mean, eventually... if he's still using remote access, but... I'll keep working on it.
time to find Hijazi.
...that's when a woman is 35 or older at the time of delivery, and doctors start mentioning statistics
statistics that show increased risk of miscarriage...
have you ever considered that maybe Monty just likes the sound of voices on the radio, and it doesn't really matter what it is we're listening to?
wait for it.
okay, changing it back, buddy. Changing it back.
I used to think I was a terrible gambler.
the therapist explained it to me. In Monty's archetypal canine subconscious...
okay, stop. - It's actually Pavlovian...
no, you have to stop.
this is getting far too weird. No...
here comes Hijazi.
let's go.
Monty, protect the car. Good boy.
yes? - Hi. We need to speak to Farag Hijazi.
he's not here.
federal agents. We saw him pull up. Want to try again?
federal agents? - Yeah.
why don't you spend your time finding terrorists instead of bothering my son.
we are good citizens. We pay our taxes. We pay your salaries.
we have a right not to be harassed by Federal agents.
I guess the lecture's over. - Yeah.
afternoon.
did you guys get him? - Yeah, we got him.
Asad El-Libi was broadcasting from your shop.
no sign of forced entry.
guess you gave him a key.
you were Adriana Gomez's source, weren't you?
and now she's dead because of what you told her.
I did not kill her.
maybe the Libyans killed her because they couldn't get to you, Hijazi.
they couldn't get to you yet.
I told her nothing.
we can protect you.
you just tell us what you told her, help us find the guys before they find Asad El-Libi.
it's your only option. We're trying to help you.
you think he's playing us? - If he is, he's a good actor.
I want you to think about it, Hijazi.
because if you're not telling the truth and we can prove that...
so, uh...
who, exactly, do you write about in that diary of yours?
I don't have a diary.
no.
it's a journal.
you were her source. The Libyans killed her.
then they tried to kill the Naval Intelligence commander she was talking to.
it's only a matter of time before they find you.
all right, look, if you don't our protection, that's fine.
just tell us where Asad El-Libi is, so we can protect him.
I wouldn't betray Asad El-Libi.
the Libyans are still here looking for him.
you lie. I want to see Asad El-Libi.
you went to my shop; you have him.
Farag... he wasn't there.
neither was his computer.
we're trying to keep him safe. We're on your side.
my side?
first you accuse me, then you want my help?
I want a lawyer.
I think we found the car the Libyan agents used in Adriana's drive-by.
just that it was a brown Impala.
so checking traffic cams in the area around the time of the shooting, we found one with two guys who matched up to our LAX photos of the Libyan agents.
who's it registered to? - It's a rental.
and the address they gave for the rental doesn't check out.
not unless they're renting rooms at the Chuck E. Cheese on Jefferson.
all right, well, get us whatever you can.
uh, I got a parking ticket. - I'll take it.
issued this morning, 2:00 a. m. for parking on a residential street without a permit after 6: 00.
there's no way they'd be that careless.
pop the trunk.
it's him.
my Asad El-Libi.
his name was Tarek Al-Kousa.
we met a few years ago when he came to my shop.
we both loved our country, but what could we do?
it's why we were both here.
and then the Arab Spring began.
Tarek was an I. T. tech and a programmer.
when Gaddafi shut down the Internet, he saw a way to help the rebels.
why not do it from Libya?
Tarek felt he could be more effective from here.
it was easier to hack through the Libyan firewalls.
less chance of him being discovered.
but he made it seem like he was in Libya, for morale.
he knew the people had to feel he was with them for them to have faith in what he was doing.
he needed a safe place.
my shop was closed.
Tarek insisted I stay away, for my own protection and his.
if anyone saw me visiting my closed shop...
gaddafi has many resources.
the broadcasts continued.
I assumed he was still there.
you ever seen these men before?
no, I don't know these men.
they never tried to call, they never sent you any messages?
it was too risky.
you have to understand, back in Libya, the government monitored everything.
I'm sorry, just to clarify, what is the difference between a journal and a diary?
diaries are for seven-year-old girls.
so, um, you would say that a journal, then, has more adult content?
good to know.
good to know.
...knew it was possible Gaddafi had sent people here.
maybe he had already sent them.
maybe if I had gone to check on him...
Farag, this is not your fault.
we know who did this.
there's a chance we can catch them.
now, are you sure you're the only one that knew what he was doing?
he has a sister Shari. But he would never have told her he was still here.
he wouldn't put her in such danger.
she was his only family.
any luck with the facial recs?
I'm into traffic, ATM, security cams, anything my system can access or hack into.
three guys in a city of ten million.
Asad El-Libi is on-line again.
what? How can that be?
it's live.
and he's clearly referencing events that happened after we found his body.
Hey, guys, Asad El-Libi is broadcasting again.
either someone has taken Asad El-Libi's place or Farag is lying to us.
maybe her brother told her more than Farag thinks. Kensi, Deeks.
and... Monty, come on!
come on!
Yeah, you want to drive?
probably better than Kensi.
it's not the man, it's what he stands for.
which means they'll come after this guy, as well.
whoever he is.
I'm so proud of him, what he did.
I just...
I wish I had known that he was still here this whole time.
the thought of him being so close, and now he's gone.
you know, your brother knew what he was doing was dangerous.
and he wanted to protect you. - Yeah.
shari, someone has taken over your brother's broadcasts.
can you think of anyone that would do that?
the only one he would trust to do something like this is Farag Hajazi.
did you notice anything out of the ordinary in the past few days?
strangers, cars, anything you can think of?
a few days ago, I thought I was being followed.
did you see who it was?
it was a red van. And I...
I kept seeing it in the streets, in the parking lots where I went shopping.
when was the last time you saw it?
this morning.
we need to go now. Please.
whoever this new Asad El-Libi is, he's good.
at least I've got a bead on the fake IP in Libya.
Yeah. He's sending out encrypted messages.
looks like they're going out to several of the rebel leaders.
can we read them? - Not from his end.
okay, why don't you try ...accessing the message through the recipient's IP.
if you start appearing in my dreams, I'm going to be really freaked out.
well, you've already appeared in mine.
Really?
only you were old.
and really fat.
and wearing my dress.
weird, huh? - Yeah.
Oh, got one.
uh, Asad El-Libi is telling them to meet.
some kind of a summit in... Quarat as Sawadiq.
mm, small town, 50 clicks southwest of Misrata.
Uh-oh. - What oh?
uh, something I saw earlier on the Naval Intelligence updates.
gaddafi pulled a large part of his artillery and troops away from Misrata.
which wouldn't make sense, considering the battle for control over that city is pivotal in the war.
unless... - He knows about the rebel summit.
this just gets worse.
I'm seeing more encrypted messages from our new Asad El-Libi.
only, these aren't going to the rebels.
they've been sent to Gaddafi's military command.
Eric, Asad El-Libi is setting up the rebels.
how much time do we have?
the summit's scheduled for 2: 00 a. m. Misrata time.
we have less than two hours to stop a massacre that could change the course of the war.
Hetty has been in contact with the CIA, who are in turn trying to tell the rebels.
not a lot of love lost between those two.
in addition to no coherent command structure, the rebels are now being forced to make a choice between the word of the CIA and a man they believe is the voice of the revolution.
any way to jam the broadcast, send out a warning?
the signal's being bounced through a dozen different countries.
the only way to do it would be from Asad El-Libi's actual computer.
Eric, check traffic cams around Hijazi's restaurant in the last couple days.
what are we looking for? - Red van.
Shari Al-Kousa said she'd been followed.
red vehicles, red vehicles. Red van.
there's writing on the side.
Arabic.
grocery store. Could be a Halal market.
Yeah, there's lots of markets.
there are... but this one's real close to where you found Asad El-Libi's body.
looks like you're going shopping, Sam.
Salaam Alaykum. - Alaykum As-salaam.
how can I help? - I have family coming in from Sudan-- my father's birthday.
Oh, a feast. - Yes.
how many? - 25 to 30. I need lamb.
whole or butchered? - Whole.
you mind if I select it myself?
everything we carry is slaughtered and prepared by strict Sharia standards.
I mean no disrespect.
it's a family tradition.
superstition.
get the feeling not everything back there is Halal.
sir, sir, sir, where you going? Sir...
federal agent!
stop!
put down the knife.
Allahu Akbar!
Eric, we need an ambulance. Now.
dead guy is Navid Mufar.
going over the calls from his cell phone now.
running out of time here, guys.
this is strange.
Mufar got a ten-minute call from Hijazi's home at 3: 00 p. m.
we've had Hijazi at the boat shed since 2: 00.
exactly.
so who was at Hijazi's house calling Mufar?
we need to speak with your son.
thought you'd like to know we've had a breakthrough.
thank you.
his death will be avenged.
he's making a call. - Come on, let it be close.
Pasadena!
432 North Woodway.
there is a problem.
stop! Federal agents!
got one coming back your way!
on your knees!
clear!
Eric, we're good to go.
okay, guys, but we're gonna have to move. This summit is about to start.
all right, connecting to you now. I just got to get into their setup.
you good?
getting on-line to transmit. Nell.
putting up his image.
we are a go from Ops.
according to our Agency friends, most of the rebels heard the message and were able to avoid the trap.
thanks to a special friend who has taken up the torch,
Asad El-Libi lives on.
and in special recognition of your past contributions,
Monty, you are now an official honorary member of our team.
good boy.
I don't believe this.
problem, Mr. Hanna? - Nothing.
has Homeland picked up Mr. Hijazi's father?
taken into custody a couple hours ago.
unfortunately, too many members of his generation bought the lies of tyrants.
the new Asad El-Libi, hopefully, will help remedy that situation.
you want some?
what?
do you want some of this?
I have a question.
how did we get from Romania to America?
no one knows.
it was two years before I found out you were here.
too late again to save your sister.
but not you.
you got me out of the orphanage?
and into every foster home.
I was determined to find you a family.
you were a challenging child, Mr. Callen.
I asked the Agency to trawl the archives.
it's an old friend paying back an old favor.
I wish there was more.
what about my father?
we never found out.
well, look what I found.
let's get out of here. - Okay.
where are we going? - You'll have to wait and see.
the Engineering building?
come on, no one will see us.
Oh, my God, you're insane! We should go back to my room! - Stop whining. Come here.
sweet mother of God.
I'm going to miss you so much.
I know. I'm going to miss you more.
no, I think I'm going to miss you more. - Show me.
Oh, geez!
go, go, go! - Your shirt, your shirt!
come on.
no luck? - Can't believe this is so hard.
you still working on the Olvera case? - No.
the Stewart case? - No.
Christmas present.
Parker Pony?
hottest toy of the year. Been sold out for months.
only got 48 hours. - And the clock is ticking.
all right, there has to be other toy horses.
you don't get it. She talks, she flaps her wings, and she responds to 30 commands.
Oh, five more than Deeks.
how's that? You talking about me?
are you going away?
no. Just looking at cars.
happy holidays one and all.
everything okay, Hetty?
last night, I had a metanoia.
maybe you should stretch more.
I was watching A Christmas Carol with George C. Scott.
while viewing the follies of Ebenezer Scrooge I suddenly thought, we need some holiday cheer right here in our shop.
so end of the day tomorrow, we'll gather for some merriment.
merriment.
your attendance is mandatory.
I do not have time for that.
you're a mean one, Mr. Hanna.
I have a non-cancellable plan.
it's going to be great.
all right, we're all going to be hanging out together, have a couple of drinks, a few laughs. It's going to be fun.
the holiday call of duty.
Oh, come all ye faithful.
engineering department at C. I.T.
guard was kayoed with ether.
is he all right? - He was out for 15 minutes.
long enough for someone to break into the lab of Professor Gareth Carlyle.
a Department of Defense researcher and an expert on EMP.
electromagnetic pulses.
don't you have to have a nuclear weapon to create a pulse like that?
that's how they discovered EMP's in the '60s.
nuclear testing in the Pacific knocked out street lights a thousand miles away in Hawaii.
carlyle's focus is on non-nuclear EMP's.
the man in black made off with a 200-pound weapon prototype.
how'd he do it alone? - An accomplice or a dolly?
the missing weapon is called a Flux Compression Generator.
Seriously?
let's hope he didn't drive away at 88 miles an hour in his Delorean.
like Doc Brown.
back to the Future? - We get it.
actually that's a Flux Capacitor. This is a little.
uh... the... flux has an explosive primer wrapped in a copper coil which generates the pulse.
it can take out a building's worth of electronic gear.
computers, cell phones, car ignitions, anything with a chip.
it could cripple the air traffic control tower at LAX,
federal Building, LAPD Operations Center.
what do we know about Carlyle?
Ex-Navy. Straight arrow.
wife's an office manager, daughter's at the college
chinese studies major.
we'll start with the professor, see what we're up against.
Kensi, Deeks, why don't you check out the guard?
Yeah, I got to know a few SEALS, on the N. S.Comfort.
a hospital ship?
Yeah, I was chief engineer during Desert Storm.
not too many casualties back then.
mainly humanitarian work.
I helped bring her to Haiti last year.
so you have any idea who'd want to get their hands on a flux?
usual suspects, I suppose. Drug cartels, anarchists, al Qaeda.
we're monitoring that. How hard is it to deploy?
easier than a car bomb and a hell of a lot more destructive.
who knew you were working on it? - A couple of staffers, grad students.
anybody that showed a particular interest in your work?
I wish. Disinterest is, uh, more what I'm up against.
well, what about other researchers? Anybody who'd want to get their hands on it?
no, there's not a lot of competition.
department of Defense cut way back on the budget for EMP research.
anyone who'd want to hurt you?
uh, yeah, my wife. But she'd use the car bomb.
she's Irish. It's a bad joke.
she's a bit of a fiery redhead, and we're not together anymore.
um, I'm sorry, guys. I got a hundred students here waiting for their last lecture of the semester.
you guys are welcome to sit in if you like.
who needs a cup of 40-weight? - No, we're good.
Yeah. So you're back to work already?
never took a sick day. Not going to let a little ether ruin that.
so what'd you see?
stars, circling birdies.
anything identifiable on the guy?
nothing. But I could for sure pick that smooching co-ed out in a lineup.
I figure they were in on it.
they got me away from my post just long enough for that ninja attack.
okay, we'll be sure to look into that, Columbo.
Carlyle-- how long have you known him?
22 years.
did he ever get into any fights? Arguments with co-workers?
nicest guy there is.
these other professors， they don't even know my name.
he remembers my birthday, gets me a Christmas present every year.
it's a damn shame.
what's a， what's a damn shame?
they say he didn't make tenure. You know what that means.
I do.
Eric, this better be good news.
no luck yet, Sam. I'll stay on it.
all right. - Okay?
Yeah, keep trying.
what? - He can't find a Parker Pony.
if Eric can't find it, no one can.
he couldn't find my car either.
is that who I think it is?
thought he had a last lecture to get to.
stairs.
smart guy. He used my elevator trick.
what do you mean your elevator trick? I made up that trick.
got to be here somewhere.
what happened to your lecture? - I had to cancel it.
I,I,I have an emergency meeting at the Naval base in San Diego.
you always respond to emergency meetings on your hands and knees?
no. - You lied to us, Professor.
now would be a pretty good time to start telling the truth.
I... Yes, um...
I,I,I don't know what I was thinking.
the flux is in the trunk of my car.
you stole it from yourself? - Yes, so I'd have an alibi.
why would you need an alibi?
the flux is set to discharge tonight.
it'll take out the entire Engineering Department.
this thing isn't going to go boom when I open it, right?
no.
Oh, God.
I think we've got a problem.
the garage gets locked up at midnight.
security makes their rounds at 1: 00 and at 3: 00, so at 2: 00 a. m.no one gets hurt.
you would have fried every Engineering computer. That's major damage.
are you trying to get back at the guys who didn't approve your tenure?
no. No, I'm trying to tell the world about the legitimacy of an EMP threat.
and you thought a practical demonstration would do that?
I've been trying to tell them for 20 years.
the government shut me down, the university shut me down.
I honestly didn't know what else to do.
look-- I screwed up, I know that, okay?
I screwed up big time, I get it.
he was a star witness at the congressional EMP threat hearings.
unfortunately, the commission decided that EMP was a remote possibility.
nothing to worry about.
our entire economy runs on vulnerable electronics.
but it would cost billions to protect us.
my dad's research is good. It's just being ignored.
they cut off all of his grant money.
is he working on anything new?
you don't get grants, you don't get tenure. - Right.
and you lose your job.
he's lost weight. He looks terrible.
when was the last time you saw him?
maybe a month ago.
when things got bad, it's like his whole personality changed.
we'd get in these huge fights every night.
he'd snap at us over the tiniest things.
I was kind of glad when he moved out.
how long are you gonna keep him?
when we're done, I'm afraid he's gonna have to go to jail because of the assault on the security guard.
doesn't really matter.
we weren't even gonna have Christmas together this year.
that's your best shot.
you have to find this thing, do you understand me?
in the wrong hands, the flux is a disaster waiting to happen.
I,I'll do anything I can to help.
how hard is it to reprogram?
a TV repairman could do it.
who else knew you made it? - Just a handful of my students, so...
names.
hamada Al-Aziz. He's a master's student.
his uncle works for a Somali charity.
seed? Who names their kid Seed? - He's cute.
he's a Ph. D.candidate.
he was arrested for spiking trees in Oregon.
teaching assistant Patrick Quade, he's got two unpaid parking tickets.
Ooh, that flux'll wipe 'em right off his DMV record.
Chester Wilkins and Bevan Tao.
learn their names, Kensi.
Nell has your college transcript, your senior thesis and your GRE results.
you're going back to school.
can I help you?
Hey. I'm Kayla Glenn. I start the master's program in January.
get a job flipping burgers. Save yourself two years of misery.
it's a bad time. Our professor took an unexpected leave of absence, and...
final design projects are due tomorrow. I'm Seed.
this is Bevan.
I'm sorry. I don't shake hands with women.
okay, your loss.
Where'd you do your undergrad? - MIT.
intense. Who was your advisor?
the guy's a legend, the guru of green design. - Yeah.
Oh, no way. Is that a solar car?
designed and built it. - That is so cool.
the working model's at the proving ground in Palmdale.
I'm going up there tomorrow. I mean, I don't know if you're interested, but...
Oh, I'm so sorry. - Are you blind?
no, no, not blind. Just cleaning up trash.
if you dweebs are staying up all night, you need some nutrition.
Hey, just be careful with your crumbs. I just swept that whole area yesterday.
Patrick, this is Kayla.
delicious-looking tacos.
got chicken, beef and vegetarian.
McCormick" and...
now let's see...
no lock.
Seed-- what a loser.
good almonds, though, huh?
Chester, Chester. Who knew?
all right, let's see what Eric makes of this.
what's up, Deeks?
Hey, Eric, I need your help distinguish this bad boy. You ready?
Yep.
M-47 incendiary bomb, Vietnam era.
filled with either white phosphorus or napalm.
I'm sorry, did you just say "napalm"?
or white phosphorous.
those particular bomb cases leaked.
they leaked?
okay, thank you, Eric. That's good to know.
no problem.
whatever happened to keggers and toga parties?
show me what you got.
so far, we are the highest bidder. Keep it that way.
got the garage video?
about to roll.
carlyle's car, 10: 00 a. m.
while we were still on campus.
a Gremlin? - That's the ugliest car ever made.
a visit from St. Nick.
that was fake snow.
somebody's got the holiday spirit.
right, so if Santa has the flux, we gotta find the Gremlin.
so, uh, whole rental car thing. Clearly you're going somewhere.
thinking about it.
near or far? - Far.
hot or cold? - Warm.
alone or accompanied?
you don't have to answer that.
okay, I give up. - Okay.
wait. What? No, I give up, and then you tell me.
side door.
you're not gonna tell me, are you?
something tells me that Chester didn't get enough hugs.
Yes, and that's exactly where I keep my grenades, next to my crackers.
is that a ballistic missile?
what the hell is that? - I don't know, but it doesn't sound good.
it's a Tesla coil. - A what?!
nikola Tesla? The inventor of alternating current. Did you not take high school physics?
no, I was pretty much just focused on Marci De Luka's skirt.
is... Is there an off switch we just hit?
no, we have to short it out. We need water.
take off your shirt. - How's that?
take off your shirt. We'll wet it, we'll throw it, it won't arc back.
you got it.
except for the fact that we don't have any liquids.
uh, urine's a good conductor.
okay, be my guest.
I peed before we got here.
Really? - Yes.
you know what? This isn't gonna work. I've got a shy bladder.
Deeks, pee or perish!
Hey, hey, look. Goldfish. Ready? Go.
I should take it. - I played softball in college. Thanks.
I pitched hardball.
in Little League.
we make it out of this alive, we're going to Australia.
on three. One, two, three.
I think I'm gonna need a new shirt.
it's all inert ordnance.
I turn bombs into furniture for my Swords into Plowshares project.
what about the Tesla Coil? - I built it for class.
then my place got robbed. Now it's my burglar alarm.
you realize you could kill someone, right?
no. It's grounded, low frequency. It's harmless.
just, uh... makes you pee your pants and run away. Am I right?
you sit tight, Chester.
Hey, if you, uh, if you want to go after someone who'd mess with the flux, go after Carlyle's assistant. She scares the crap out of me.
so, what do we think of Chester here?
I don't think he'd hurt a flea. - Everything he said was true.
what about your assistant?
Alexis? She's a bit of a rabid animal rights activist.
they have used a bomb or two on research labs.
well, she trusts me. I'll,I'll go talk to her.
no, no. We appreciate it, but you're in custody.
sorry, Mom, it's just not a good time. We're really busy.
Yeah, I mean, we're on the air every day, even Christmas, so...
okay, well, just give Grandma a hug for me, and I'll talk to you later.
sorry about that. Um, we cross-referenced all university personnel with the DMV.
never commit a crime in a Gremlin.
driving a Gremlin is a crime.
let's pay Jeremy a visit.
uh, that's gonna be difficult.
he committed suicide last year after graduation.
supposedly, his roommate donated his car to charity. - Who's his roommate?
one of our other grad students, Hamada Al-Aziz. He's in Sherman Oaks.
you know what the 405 is like this time of day?
run a financial check on Carlyle's associates, keep looking for that Gremlin.
don't let that pony get away.
Aw, shoot, it's my mom again.
she's wondering why everyone's home except me for Christmas.
what do you tell them? - Uh, working. I'm a TV news editor.
what about you?
professional blackjack player.
Really? - True.
until I got banned from Vegas.
okay, yeah, we're on our way back. Thanks. - Sorry, Deeks. Okay.
what happened? - Dead end.
carlyle's assistant spent the whole day yesterday in the ER after she was bit trying to liberate a chimp.
although we do have a bunch of texts to her from Bevan Tao.
Urasawa?
how the hell does a grad student afford $800 sushi?
it's a good question. Nell's looking into it.
speaking of primo sushi, probably gonna find some of that in Hawaii.
have you been on my computer?
no, I'm just using my excellent powers of deduction.
or maybe it's a wild guess. - A wild guess you just confirmed.
what? Come on. All right, you stay at a nice hotel, I'll crash on the beach.
I'll show you all the places the locals go. Mele Kalikimaka.
it's the thing to say. You know what that means?
merry Christmas. " I'm going alone. You know what that means?
means I'm gonna pick you up at the airport when you get back?
that would be nice.
secret lady business?
something like that.
Hey, everybody! - Hi, Nell!
Oh, so good to see you, dear. You look great.
so do you, Ma. Man, I wish I could be there.
it's not too late to hop on a plane.
kaleidoscope is running the Gremlin.
uh, who's that, honey?
uh, that's... Eric.
Oh, oh, we've heard so much about you.
okay, gotta go, Mom. Bye. - Wait...
did I just meet your parents? - I guess so.
what have they heard about me?
well...
Ooh, you got a hit. You'd better call Sam.
it's in Hollywood.
go, Eric. - We found it. We actually found it.
the Pony? - No, not the Pony. The Gremlin.
well, at least I got my wish.
that's what happens when you wait till the last second to shop.
same thing goes for toys. - What?
come on. Could be some prints on the door.
who locks a Gremlin?
yeah? - Auction ends in 30 minutes. Can I go up on your bid?
how much? - I think we'll win at 500.
for a little toy pony? - Do it.
you taking money from the mob?
let's just say I'm a man of my word, who's going to be eating peanut butter sandwiches for the next couple of months.
you're still coming over for Christmas dinner, right?
not if you're serving peanut butter sandwiches.
this is hot. - What, hot?
it's getting hotter.
you ever seen a car do that?
once. In training.
who was training you?
a chemist.
and we are winning in three, two... one.
no. No, no, no.
I don't believe this; this can't be happening.
someone sniped us with a thousand-dollar bid.
Eric, auction's over. Tell me we got it.
have you considered Legos?
how about I break your Leg-os? - Sorry.
so, the preliminary arson report on the Gremlin is in.
it was nitrocellulose plastic, spontaneously combusting with water.
probably triggered when you pulled the door latch.
guys, there's just been another break-in at Carlyle's lab.
they stole a vircator.
Oh, boy. - What the hell's a vircator?
when it's used with a flux, a vircator acts as a kind of amplifier.
how much bigger?
big enough to kiss Los Angeles good-bye.
the vircator completes an electromagnetic device or "EMD."
fits on three shipping pallets, weighs close to a ton.
professor?
when the flux feeds a vircator, the antenna emits 30, 000 volts of microwave energy over nine miles.
I guess my surge protector won't help.
are people hurt by the pulse?
no, not unless they have a pacemaker.
how can a nine-mile hit destroy the state?
well, in the target zone-- computers, cell phones, cars
anything with a circuit board dies immediately.
then you lose electricity.
power plants are run by microchips.
fry enough nodes, the whole system goes down.
25 million people without power.
for how long? - A month or two.
if we're lucky.
Yeah. Hospitals only have backup power for 24 hours.
Yeah, and then there's loss of water pressure, water purification...
toilets back up.
no refrigeration, no food delivery to the grocery stores.
people get hungry, they get violent.
so, rioting and trauma, dehydration and starvation and disease.
I'll be on the phone with Washington.
don't make me cancel Christmas.
I was trying to alert people to the real threat of something like this happening.
instead, I've set the whole thing into motion.
how can they get it to altitude?
a suicide bomber in a private plane?
it's too heavy. You have to drop it from a cargo jet with a tailgate.
excuse me. Did Hamada work on the vircator?
Yes, actually, he did last summer for a while. Why?
well, I've got a Lockheed Tristar at LAX leased to his uncle's Somalian charity, departing tonight.
maybe not.
that thing is huge. How would you get that to the plane?
with a truck.
do any grad students own a truck?
Bevan Tao rented one two days ago.
and I show a spike in cell calls between Hamada and Bevan Tao.
the same Bevan who enjoys expensive sushi?
he can afford it.
deposit of $4, 000 into his checking account today.
I'm thinking cash for weapons. Maybe they're going to sell it.
maybe they already have.
can I come in?
hello.
you're hanging out with the janitor?
that hurts. - Federal agents.
that's a nice flatscreen. - Uh, it's a Christmas present from my dad.
Where's your moving truck?
I returned it.
your buddy Hamada give you a hand with that?
he's not my friend.
you've been calling him a lot.
he's my lab partner in nano-optics.
so you're working with him?
that was a big bank deposit you made today.
that's my tutoring money.
four grand?
if you get a rich kid into an Ivy League school, your rates go up to 300 an hour.
super interesting. What's his name?
um... Johnny.
can we get an address? - For, um... Johnny?
you're really a federal agent?
we have a schedule. We need to get all of this on the plane.
sorry.
why are we being singled out?
do you do this to the Red Cross? To Doctors Without Borders?
let ...or
bunch of canned food.
some medical supplies.
no sign of the EMD.
there's clothes. - Toys.
nice try, but I think these guys are legit.
did you say toys? - Yeah.
trust me, there is no Parker Pony in this box.
okay, and even if there was, you really gonna take it from a needy child?
Really? - I'll leave money in the box, I...
hamada's hard drive is clean. - As is his airport warehouse.
and Bevan still isn't talking.
Yeah, well, see if he can explain this.
after Bevan moved, T. A. Patrick Quade drove another 20 miles.
what do Bevan and Patrick have in common?
close to $200, 000 in student loans.
what's the job market like for these guys?
Ah, it's pretty dismal.
only 15% of new grads find jobs in their field.
that's why Jeremy Morlan took his life.
I've found recent grads working as waiters, bartenders.
even Patrick Quade pulls night shifts as a security guard.
okay. Where does he work?
office buildings, loading docks, wherever they need him.
what if you could wipe out your entire educational debt in one night?
banks keep backup files in remote locations, so that wouldn't work.
no, no, no, I'm talking about raising cash.
you know, you hit the Diamond District or... a fine art gallery.
you know what, follow my lie.
Patrick Quade drove your truck. He wanted to borrow it.
why is that?
well, Patrick's in custody, and he told us how he moved the EMD, so...
Wow. You know what that makes you? An accessory to a felony.
what is that now? Is that 15 years?
I think it's closer to 20.
20! That is a lot of showering; you are not gonna make it in ten.
he paid me four grand to borrow the truck and to keep my mouth shut.
I wouldn't be part of the robbery.
when's it going down? - Why don't you ask him?
why don't I ask... ? you know what? I got that D. A. , probably get him 50. She's great.
Yeah. Yeah.
tonight at midnight. Some bank downtown. That's all he said.
wait. Do I get a lawyer?
I don't know. Have you been naughty or nice?
ten bucks on naughty.
those idiots think they can control the cone, but you can't.
the power lines act like antennas;
the pulse will travel through to hospitals, police stations, fire departments.
people are going to die.
okay, 55 minutes to midnight. - We're running out of time.
cap crimper, socket wrench set.
all non-magnetic? - Yeah.
correct. The FAA is grounding all flights coming in and out of LAX at 23: 30.
no, no, it's more than a blackout, Doctor.
we're talking about ventilators, pacemakers, dialysis machines all quitting at once.
let's do this. - All right. Thanks, Doc.
okay, we'll keep in touch.
there are 59 banks in downtown L. A.
we've narrowed it down to a dozen.
all in high-rise buildings because you need altitude for the EMP to hit the ground with a big enough cone.
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna, should you find yourselves on the roof, there will be no air support.
a helicopter will drop like a stone in any EMP.
I hope you have a plan B, if you can't stop this thing from firing.
Sam's working on plan B.
I'm working on plan A; you're in charge of plan B.
we're still working on plan B.
is that so?
come on.
Eric, we're two minutes out. We need that building.
all right, we're down to five buildings
three of them grouped within two blocks of each other.
what about this one on Sixth Street? - Not high enough.
20 stories or higher or it's not going to work effectively.
I got a bad feeling about this.
look on the bright side.
you could be stuck in a mall fighting crowds trying to find your pony.
that's what I'm talking about.
I got a bad feeling I'm not gonna find one.
well, maybe Santa Claus will bring it to her.
maybe I'll tell her Uncle Callen said he'd get it for her.
that's messed up.
you wouldn't. - You shouldn't.
I got something. On a rooftop, looks like building supplies.
Nell, can you check the bank's security feeds?
Yeah.
we're all out of time, Mr. Beale.
side alley, guy in a motorcycle helmet.
other one's a bank security guard.
our target is National Bank, Spring Street.
less than half a block from your current location. - We're on the move.
access via the alley on the west side of the street.
two targets: one guy in a motorcycle helmet, the other's a bank security guard.
Kensi, Deeks, check the lobby. Sam and I are headed to the roof.
federal agents. - On the ground now.
Kensi! - I got him.
drop it!
you got any other weapons, huh?
maybe a slide ruler? Maybe a pointy compass?
no one was gonna get hurt.
yeah? Well, not a lot of veggie tacos in the pen, huh, Patrick?
Nell, close up the parking garage!
got it.
they must have used the freight elevator, assembled it up here.
it's got a timer. It's counting down.
we got seven minutes... - We got a visual.
all right, this is not exactly a "green wire, red wire" situation.
sorry, guys, you're gonna have to disassemble this one.
first pallet, power supply, flux is in the middle, then the vircator.
so removing the power supply is like unhooking a car battery.
come on.
we need more torque. Need a bigger wrench.
let me try. - Be my guest.
liquid nitrogen?
works every time. - There you go.
I'll take care of this. You work on Plan B.
federal agent! Stop! Stop now!
Kensi, where are you? - I'm on the second floor.
hands behind your back.
seed, didn't recognize you without your Birkenstocks.
why'd you do it? - Why?
because we gave eight years to higher education with no promise of a job or nothing.
we were just taking back from some billionaire bankers who never even deserved a bailout.
Yeah, the rich get richer and the dumb get dumber.
last one there. What next?
all right, pull off the power supply.
this way's blocked. We gotta go this way.
one, two, three...
an inch off the power supply.
no, it needs to be more. It can still arc across the gap.
it's less than a minute!
guys, you are not going to make it!
what are you doing? - Using the liquid nitrogen.
I want to make sure this thing blows before it can trigger.
we're gonna have to go plan B.
I hate plan B.
let's go, let's go, let's go!
Really? - The longest rope we had.
this is why I hate plan B.
I'm sorry, we should have made a little pit stop at REI.
we could have picked you up some granola bars, too.
you gonna answer that?
it's Hetty. You want to take it?
she's calling you, not me.
hello. - Congratulations, gentlemen.
next time, you might want to think about packing your parachutes.
you getting hungry? - Shut up.
thank you, Wesley.
LAPD is waiting.
you know, uh, I'm not a bad man, Detective.
what I did was misguided. It was wrong.
but I'm not a bad man.
could you, uh... please get a message to my daughter for me?
no, I can't.
but you can tell her yourself.
Hey, Dad.
I love you, Daddy.
I love you, too.
this is Theakston's Christmas Ale flown all the way from Yorkshire England, and brewed as it was in Charles Dickens' time.
carlyle got turned over to the LAPD.
not for long. We posted bail so he could spend Christmas with his family.
Really?
we felt he'd righted his wrong.
needless to say, with the events of the past day, there's a flood of interest in his work.
can't drink on an empty stomach.
sig Sauers and Glocks. - Amazing.
wait. Did you bake these in the microwave?
I actually reconfigured the burn room incinerator as a convection oven.
smart girl.
got a little something for you.
how'd you find it?
don't ask.
you saved my ass.
I actually got something for you too. - For me?
Yeah. It's a gift for the tropical sun.
it's made by a woman in Venice for a very select clientele.
it's hypoallergenic, made with organic coconut oil, shea butter and jojoba.
so I thought that you would, uh, like it.
thank you.
have fun on your trip.
I may come by on Christmas.
I want to see what this little pony actually does.
that was very generous of you.
you did?
Mr. Beale has quite the fantasy action figure collection.
you do? - A toast!
to friends and the family we have...
hear, hear. - Hear, hear.
Cheers. Cheers.
merry Christmas.
God bless us every one.
my name is Elmslie.
the Global Criminal Tribunal is trying to indict ex-governor Khaled for crimes against humanity.
you're a spy.
kill him.
that's Khaled's sister Jada.
you could come to America with me.
I love you.
I love you, too.
you're on American soil now.
you'll be asked to testify against your brother. You'll never see me again.
clear.
reverse! Punch it!
come on, man! Come on!
get her out of there! Get her out! Get her out!
get out!
is it true?
what's that?
scuttlebutt is Granger's gone.
Oh, that.
do we need to check your trunk?
I wish.
no, I think this is a temporary reprieve.
I think he's off tormenting some other division.
he'll come back when he grows bored with making their lives a living hell.
at least we've got something to look forward to.
my money's on Hetty.
no doubt. Cobra versus the mongoose. Always bet on the little mongoose.
come on, man, we haven't even sat down yet.
no rest for the wicked.
I think he's talking about you.
early this morning, an NCIS protection detail was attacked by a masked man driving an unmarked SUV.
they were transferring a high-profile witness to a safe house.
well, they certainly weren't discreet about it.
fortunately, there were no casualties.
who was the witness?
is she all right?
she's fine.
Jada's first deposition for the Global Criminal Tribunal officials was scheduled for this afternoon.
our friend, Alex Elmslie has been here in Los Angeles working with U. S.officials on the case.
someone doesn't want Jada giving up information on her brother's mass killings in the Sudan.
I'll give you three guesses on who that is.
what do we have on Khaled?
tahir Khaled is currently in hiding.
he last popped up on the grid in Somalia, but the trail went cold a few weeks ago.
where is Jada now?
since the attack, she's been under the GCT's protection at a safe house in Glendale.
anything on the SUV?
I'm running it through Kaleidoscope, but nothing yet.
Nell, get in touch with Elmslie. He should have info on Khaled.
Kensi and Deeks, talk to Jada.
we'll take the parking garage.
sending addresses to your phones.
we cool?
cool.
I wouldn't think any less of you if you decided to sit this one out, Mr. Hanna.
I don't sit things out.
guy came out of nowhere, didn't have much time to react.
he gave up soon as we opened fire on him.
doesn't exactly point to a well-planned job.
no problems before today?
nothing out of the ordinary.
preliminary questioning and routine transfers were all on schedule.
okay.
Thanks. -- You got it.
it's not the best spot for an assassination attempt.
got a security cam, two agents, one escape route.
everything about this screams amateur hour.
well, that or desperation.
you know you're gonna have to speak to her at some point.
I know.
they may have been amateurs, but they had some pretty damn good Intel on where Jada was gonna be and when she was gonna be there.
somebody could be feeding Khaled info.
we need to talk to Elmslie.
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye, and this is Detective Marty Deeks.
I remember who you are.
I know you've had a tough morning, but we do need to ask you some questions.
do you have any idea who would do this?
do you think that your brother would try to hurt you?
I think you know the answer to that.
has Khaled tried to get in touch with you at all?
he has not.
does your brother have any contacts in the U. S?
he did, but... I do not know if they are here anymore.
you got a name for us?
thank you.
any luck on Khaled?
not yet. Thanks, Kens.
all right, Khaled had a U. S.Operative. Absalom Bakri-- B-A-K-R-I.
let me see what I can dig up.
guys? Elmslie hasn't reported in today.
he rents a house here in Los Feliz with his family.
no answer there and no one with the GCT has heard from him in the last 24 hours.
Elmslie is missing.
Elmslie's cars are still here.
they're cold.
federal Agents!
Elmslie? It's Sam and Callen.
side door's open.
so was the front door.
clear.
clear.
clear.
all clear.
no sign of forced entry or struggle.
something doesn't feel right.
looks like they left in a hurry. But they didn't take their cars.
cab to the airport?
Eric, see if there's any airline reservations under their names.
also, pull up their cell phones.
maybe Elmslie thought his family was in danger because of the attack on Jada, decided to move them.
or they actually could be in danger. Eric?
no plane tickets and both Elmslie and his wife's cell phones are turned off.
what do we have here?
solves that mystery.
Eric, we got the cell phones here. - Perfect.
they could've ditched them before they took off.
maybe somebody else ditched them so they couldn't be tracked.
Eric, look at everyone Elmslie spoke to in the last 48 hours.
texts, e-mails, cell phones, everything.
all right, from the looks of it...
Elmslie spent the majority of his time at the Federal Building on Wilshire.
other than calls to his wife, most of his communication is with GCT Officer Daryl Marru.
Elmslie and Marru have been working closely with U. S.authorities on the Khaled case.
got a hit on Absalom Bakri.
took a little digging, but it looks like he's been operating under a few false identities, one of which is attached to a lease on a warehouse in Koreatown.
all right, Eric, see if Hetty can talk to Marru and find out if he's heard from Elmslie.
Kensi, Deeks, talk to Bakri.
sending Bakri's address and photos your way.
you get a hit on that SUV?
Kaleidoscope's got nothing.
you'd think that a car with front-end damage and bullet holes in the windshield would make this easier.
this is L. A.
maybe they're just laying low.
or maybe they just switched cars. - S- witched cars.
jinx. You owe me a soda.
What?! I never played with soda rules. I always played with dead arm rules.
what's dead arm? -- Dead arm.
I like soda rules better.
mama. -- Are you okay?
Yeah. No, totally. I was...
I was just... I wasn't ready.
I can't feel my fingers.
we've all been there. You did what you had to do.
for the greater good?
Yeah, for the greater good.
you saw the grave. We were taking down a mass murderer.
and yet Jada's the one who's locked up and was almost killed today.
Sam, you did the right thing. -- Did I?
look, Saddam, Qaddafi- they all end up in a hole in the ground.
hell, even Hitler died in his bunker.
you and me- we're putting Khaled in that hole.
gentlemen?
Elmslie told Marru he was going out of town for a few days with his family.
but the hotel name Elmslie left him doesn't seem to exist.
what was the name he gave him?
the Desert Jewel.
they can't find it because it's not there.
it's in Khartoum.
that's the hotel I stayed in with Jada.
it could be Elmslie asking for help.
or warning us to back off.
all right, this is the warehouse Bakri's leasing.
smells like a roller rink out here.
who goes to a roller rink?
you never went as a kid?
no.
how do you not go?
you're talking about, uh, you know, arcade games, disco balls, couples skates. Hey, triples skate.
well, I was just more into building campfires and going fishing.
that's right; you were the poster girl for the Tomboys for America. I forgot.
actually, I was just outdoorsy.
know who else is outdoorsy-- Labrador Retrievers.
I don't know why I bother talking to you sometimes.
real question is: do you think you were born a tomboy, or you become one because your dad really wanted a son?
you did not just say that.
no... no, no, no, that... that came out wrong.
I was just asking the classic question of nature versus nurture
Yeah, no, no. That's definitely genetic.
Oh, man. Really?
think you might be packing an extra Y chromosome there, Ms. Klinefelter.
are you ready?
federal agents! Don't move!
I'll take the back! - No. No!
snap!
Calf-roping champion?
Yee-haw.
no more questions until I get a lawyer.
you might want to get two lawyers.
one for a credit card scam, and one for the attempted murder of a federal witness and two agents.
I don't know what you're talking about.
which part?
the illegal funding of Khaled's terrorist operation, or trying to kill his sister?
khaled who?
I'm a businessman. I never tried to kill anyone.
this is racial profiling.
now, you want to arrest me, go ahead.
your jails are so overcrowded, I'll be out by lunchtime.
that's what I thought.
sit the hell down!
get your hands off me unless you want an assault charge.
I'll take the charge.
your partner... has anger issues.
he'll be hearing from my lawyer.
I didn't say you could leave.
you can't hold me here.
what, you didn't check your terrorist manual?
I can keep you here, and I will keep you here.
hell, I'll send you to Guantanamo Bay if I want. Now, sit down.
what's he doing?
I got questions.
you're going to give me answers one way or another.
he-he can't... he-he can't do this!
aren't you going to stop him?
this is against the law!
so are credit card scams and attempted murder.
I never tried to kill anyone!
well, somebody tried to kill Jada this morning.
it wasn't me. I swear.
I was in my apartment. I have witnesses.
when was the last time you talked to Khaled?
how long ago?
three weeks! Three weeks.
he order a hit on his sister?
no. Why would he do that?
she's testifying against him for war crimes.
I don't know anything about this.
where is Khaled?
last I heard, he was in Somalia. I swear.
what do you think?
I think you scared the hell out of him.
in fact, you were starting to scare me.
that was the point.
point taken, but assuming he's telling the truth, we got a problem.
Yeah. Outside of Khaled, who else would want to kill Jada?
any enemies would want her alive, to better the chances of Khaled being indicted.
well, unless it's not one of his enemies.
maybe it was one of his old friends trying to bury their relationship, so they don't go down with him.
but what's the connection to Elmslie?
did you find anything on Bakri's laptop?
still working on it.
now that Khaled's IP is off the grid, it doesn't really do me any good.
I mean, if he was online, we could run a trace route through the log files on Bakri's computer.
got a hit on our SUV from the roof.
where?
downtown. Here's the video footage.
this is five minutes ago.
doesn't make sense.
unless... Elmslie's been playing us all along.
maybe he used us to get Jada into the country for his own purposes.
the building they're entering is owned by a legitimate commercial developer.
it's still under renovation.
right there. What-What are they looking at?
can you give us a shot of the street, Eric?
can I give you a shot of the street? Hello.
nothing really of note.
Eric, go back to when he pointed and zoom in, would you?
and... there we go.
what is he saying?
he's saying, "Welcome to Hollywood."
he was pointing at the Hollywood sign.
so Elmslie's giving star tours?
he knows he's on camera.
he's pointing at the Hollywood sign to get the others on camera, too.
why would he do that?
I think he did it for us.
run these guys. We're headed downtown.
good luck.
jinx. That's two.
federal Agents! Stay where you are!
Kensi, Deeks, third floor.
hands where we can see 'em!
I'm sorry.
Alex... what's going on?
they took my family.
said they'd kill them if I didn't kill Jada.
who?
I don't know who they are.
I was hoping you could find out. I'm assuming they work for Khaled.
that's why you put them on camera.
where are they now?
left just before you got here.
you tried to kill Jada?
I had to make it look like a real assassination attempt.
it was just to buy me some time.
you come in with us. We can help you.
too risky. They could still be watching me.
I've already endangered my family just by talking with you.
why you?
payback. For me and you.
they knew I'd have access to her.
you can't do this on your own, Elmslie.
stop! - He's got a grenade!
Oh, come on! Who does that?
I appreciate your help, but I can't come in with you.
I only have 12 hours to find my family.
what if you can't?
I don't have much of a choice.
are you really prepared to kill Jada?
please don't try to follow me.
I'm sorry.
it's only a smoke grenade.
clever little bastard.
we've got a hit on Elmslie's guys.
it's an interesting group. We've identified three so far.
these two are former DGSE.
french External Intelligence Agency?
why are former French spooks working with Khaled?
what are former French operatives doing in this country, period?
Yeah, you'd think they would have learned their lesson after Kensi kicked one of their freres in the croissants the last time we met.
you know it.
who's the third guy?
that would be Adrien Montalban.
he lives in Prague, but he's also a French citizen.
runs a legitimate consulting firm. Montalban International.
and career advice for multinational corporations, politicians, startups, you name it.
they have branches all over the world, including Los Angeles.
unfortunately, their data servers are in a private cloud.
we'd have to be on-site to access anything, assuming we had a warrant, of course.
of course. Bakri didn't think Khaled had anything to do with the attack on Jada.
but Elmslie thinks these guys are working with Khaled.
you think they have Elsmlie's family?
I don't know. - Maybe it's time to go to the source.
who's the source? - Khaled.
but we don't know where he is.
Yeah, but if Bakri is working with Khaled, he obviously has a way to get in touch with him.
Yeah, even if he does, he would never tell us.
I think he might.
Kens, if Hetty can get you a warrant, you think you and Deeks can get into Montalban International?
pas de problem.
I love it when you talk dirty.
looks like you're packing or going hunting.
Oh, no, no, no. Just routine maintenance.
right.
so we need an expedited covert entry search warrant for Montalban International.
I'll make a call.
how's your partner?
he's good.
not, uh, on the verge of waterboarding anyone?
of course not.
there's a lot at stake, Mr. Callen.
it's not just Jada whose life is on the line.
now Sam has the lives of Elmslie and his family hanging over his head.
we are all concerned about them.
Yes, I know.
but you don't blame yourself for this.
Sam would do anything to save Jada and Elmslie's family.
even if it means sacrificing his own life.
you really need to be extra careful.
for both of you.
I will.
office buildings make me nauseous.
what do you got, Nell?
okay, you need to get to the server room. It's located on the second floor.
get a cell phone connected to one of the hubs in there, and we should be able to copy their database.
I'm sending floor plans to your tablet now.
copy that.
these things make me feel like I'm in a noose, but...
good God, do I look breathtaking.
I prefer you in a noose.
a little bondage play? Really?
you naughty little librarian.
where do you guys get this from?
okay. How do you want to play it? Pope in the Pool?
with a Swedish Handoff? - You suck at the Swedish Handoff.
are you kidding me? I practically invented it.
certainly perfected it.
good afternoon... Maribel.
welcome to Montalban International. How can I help you?
christopher Stone. Stone Electronic Solutions.
ses, if you want to be quick about it.
good afternoon, Mr. Stone.
indeed it is. Only thing that could possibly make it better is my meeting with Montalban.
that and maybe seeing that beautiful smile one more-- And there it is.
I'm afraid Mr. Montalban is unavailable this afternoon.
are you sure you have the right time?
110% sure. In fact, if you could just check your records again,
I'm sure I'm down for 3: 00 p. m. sharp.
Yes. Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing anything.
Mr. Stone?
please tell me that you remembered to make this appointment last month, because I only reminded you about 5, 000 times.
of course. I mean, I think so.
of course you did or you think so?
which one is it? 'Cause those are two very different things.
if you'd like, I may be able to set you up with one of our senior advisors.
what I'd like is to have an assistant that isn't a complete incompetent moron.
what about you, Maribel?
you seem smart. They pay you enough here?
well, I... - I'm sure you can type circles around this one.
at least we know you can put together an outfit.
which is much better than-- Really?
with the tears again? Every single day with the tears and the sobbing.
I'll tell you what.
here's the deal, missy. I'm gonna plant my wingtips right here, and I'm not leaving until Mr. Montalban walks through one of those doors.
sir, I think it's time for you to leave.
we're just having a slightly animated conversation.
it's good for the blood. No reason to, uh, become alarmed.
this guy. - It's my job to be alarmed, pal.
okay, my real pals know not to touch me.
that's mistake numero uno.
okay, come on, let's go.
Oh, we're doing this? You want to do it?
come on. - Right now?
that's fine. We'll do it.
I can walk.
hands off, huh? I can walk myself.
I'm so, so sorry.
don't even worry about it.
it's just been one of those months, you know.
look at that, I'm all blubbery.
do you have a bathroom that I could use to freshen up a little bit?
sure. It's right down the hall.
thank you.
plugging the phone in now.
I've got the signal.
and I'm in.
copying their database.
hide it well.
the phone needs to be on for at least a few hours to complete the transfer.
copy that.
put your rear in gear, honey! That car ain't driving itself!
you need a new job.
Yeah, tell me about it.
okay, I'm plugging in the IP addresses Sam got from Bakri.
I know, I know, we're running out of time.
just because I make this look easy, doesn't mean it is.
Yeah, we know that. Just relax and take your time, okay?
just not too much time.
okay, I think this will work.
all right, I've pinged the IP addresses you got from Bakri, basically, just alerting them to... I think I got something.
how do we confirm it's Khaled?
I'm gonna try to a Trojan, could allow me to initiate a video conference.
do it.
just promise me you won't hurt me if it doesn't work.
have I ever hurt you, Eric? - No.
but there could always be a first time.
I got something.
I can only applaud your American ingenuity.
and apparently Bakri's inability to keep his mouth shut.
takes a special kind of coward to force somebody else to kill their own sister, Khaled.
this from a man who makes lying his profession.
I'm a liar; you're a murderer.
I think we're both familiar with each other's professions.
and yet you clearly don't know me.
I would never allow anyone to harm my sister.
no... when Jada dies, it will be at my hand...
as will you.
your friend Adrien Montalban says different.
Yes, every country wants to be your friend, but when you don't get what you want, you toss me to the wolves.
just like you have my sister.
you did that on your own, Khaled.
I am not the one who kidnapped her.
we rescued her.
I'm sure she feels differently.
look at you with all your technology, and yet... I am still free.
I wouldn't get used to it.
you have shamed my family.
and there is a day coming when I will bring shame to all of yours.
it's gonna take me a bit to pinpoint his exact location.
keep trying.
come on.
I'm getting a ton of encrypted files off Montalban's servers, but it's gonna take me a while to look through everything.
well, narrow your search for the years Khaled was in office.
look for anything in Sudan.
got it.
you're thinking Montalban's in business with Khaled.
I'm thinking he's a middle man for the French government.
the French have a long history in that area.
could have been trying to get a foothold in Sudan.
and then they hear rumors of his war crimes?
not exactly who they were hoping for.
so they "threw him to the wolves.
but they weren't expecting us to get Jada out.
if she testifies as to what really went down, not only is Montalban gonna take hit, but the French government is going to have some serious explaining to do.
nice work at Montalban's.
Thanks.
we're running out of time.
which means Elmslie's family is running out of time.
if Elmslie was gonna kill Jada, he would have already done it.
he knows there's no way they're gonna let his family go.
the only leverage he has left is Jada.
and if he doesn't plan on killing Jada?
he's going to try to grab her and force a trade.
Jada said she still wants to make a deposition this afternoon. She wants to get it over with.
which means they're gonna move her again.
you think Elmslie knows that?
I think he's counting on it.
don't move!
hands on the dash. - Hands on the wheel.
what are you going to do with that, smoke me to death?
you recognize any of these men?
I have never seen this man.
but these two had several meetings with my brother.
I believe they were arms dealers.
more or less.
thank you.
how have they been contacting you?
I call them from a burn phone, hang up, and then they call back from another number.
you're going to tell them you have Jada, and you want to trade for your family.
that was your plan, wasn't it?
what if they don't go for it?
they will. If they want Jada.
they think they're dealing with one desperate operator. They won't be expecting us.
all right, guys, we've managed to decrypt Adrien Montalban's files.
looks like he was filtering weapons to Khaled from a rogue source within the French military.
and unfortunately, he did a good job of covering his tracks.
at best, you might be able to tie Khaled to Montalban.
but Jada's testimony can change all that.
she just identified two former DGSE agents who met with her brother.
Jada ties them to her brother, we tie them to Montalban.
and the walls come tumbling down.
Exactement.
when they call back, you tell them you know Montalban was brokering weapons from the French to Khaled.
that should give us the edge we need.
now we wait.
no, No, no.
well, at least we still have audio.
all right, I'm just gonna ask it-- the giant elephant in the room question.
you think anything ever happened between those two?
Sam's the most honorable man I know.
Jada... - No.
you do not get to speak to me.
you get to listen.
you made me trust you, Sam.
you made me turn my back on the only family I had left.
you made me kill for you.
life with my brother was not perfect, but at least I thought I had you.
I believed that I had you.
and now I have nothing.
I don't know what else I can say other than I'm sorry.
Sam, I do not want your textbook apologies.
what I want I cannot have.
you weren't part of the plan.
you just happened.
why did you speak to me on that first day?
Why?
because you looked alone.
they're calling back.
is it done?
no. Jada's still alive, but I have her.
that was not what we discussed.
but it's what we're discussing now, Adrien.
if you want the deals that you brokered between Khaled and the French kept secret, then I suggest we arrange a trade.
my family for Jada.
we meet in one hour. I'll text you the location.
we'll keep her safe.
I don't especially like being told what to do.
I just want my family back.
that all depends on you.
this is how it's going to work: We take Jada with us.
I leave one of my men here with you and your family.
once we're safely away, I'll call my man, he'll leave.
I'm not a fool.
that's not what we discussed.
but it's what we're discussing now, Elmslie.
do you even have the slightest idea of who you're dealing with?
Allez! Allez!
it's okay. It's okay.
what? What is it?
Montalban. He's gone.
everything that's happened...
...everything we've been through...
...I had no choice.
I am trying to understand.
I wish I could.
Oh, hey, what's that for?
all the ones I owe you, plus a little more.
Nell... Come on, it's just a game. It's not... not for real.
Oh, I can take 'em back.
no, no, no... Since you went through all the trouble, just might as well hang on to 'em.
Yeah. Hey, Bubbly Cola.
that's my favorite. How did you know that?
I may or may not have been doing a little Facebook stalking.
excuse me.
I think I've been quite clear with my "no food or drink in Ops" policy, don't you?
sorry. - Sorry.
jinx.
looks like I win.
good night.
Eric found Khaled.
he'll brief you.
and Homeland Security grabbed Montalban trying to board his private jet to Morocco.
no surprise there.
sooner or later, our sins seem to catch up to us.
good night, Mr. Callen.
you're the second one I found in here today cleaning their weapons.
apparently, you and Hetty have more in common than I thought.
Eric found Khaled.
he's in Spain.
he's making his way here.
so you've never been dumped?
what part of "never" don't you understand?
I don't believe you.
well, that's understandable considering your track record.
but honestly, look at me, huh?
I mean, how could you break up with this, you know?
I'm super fun, I'm like 365 days of heaven.
heaven? See, I was thinking south and much, much, much hotter.
so, like, Mexico?
let me guess, you're the "senses the breakup, initiates preemptive strike" guy.
Yeah, well, it's much better to be the breaker than the breakee, I think.
you're just broken, Deeks.
Yeah, well, no argument there.
uh, what are we, what are we doing here? Where are the guys?
I don't actually know. I just got a page from Ops to meet here.
what, are they hiding? Are you guys hiding, huh?
you throwing me a surprise party?
you do know it's not your birthday, right?
which is why it would be so surprising.
agent Blye, could you come in here, please?
you invited Granger? - Yeah.
this is the worst surprise birthday party ever.
you can go, and you can have a seat.
you good? - Yeah.
all right.
other side, Agent Blye.
suspects usually sit on the other side.
Yeah, they do. Sit down.
we need Hetty. Granger is wearing out his welcome.
you hear anything? - About what?
she's not answering her phone.
he say what it's about? - Any other names come up?
whoa, whoa, whoa, I called you guys for answers. Where is Hetty?
here, Mr. Deeks. All of you, upstairs now.
what's Granger up to now?
like you, I can't speculate what the assistant director is up to.
maybe this will shed some light on the situation. Nell.
retired Master Sergeant David Blake boarded a military flight from Hawaii and landed at LAX at approximately 1: 00 a. m. this morning.
he was killed four hours ago in a car accident.
his rental car crashed through an on-ramp barrier off the 105 freeway.
so what's the connection to Kensi?
in 1997 Blake was part of a sniper training unit.
he was the spotter for a sniper by the name of Donald Blye.
that's Kensi's father. - Yes.
Mr. Beale, access the secure server.
open a file-- Ghost Recon.
so Kensi comes from a long line of snipers.
who else can say that?
still doesn't explain what Granger is up to.
I'm afraid it does.
the last person to be in touch with Sergeant Blake before he died was Kensi.
explain your order of business while in Hawaii.
you have asked me that three times.
repetitive questioning tactic to trip up a suspect-- amateur at best.
again, my father belonged to a sniper training unit at Camp Lejeune.
david Blake was his spotter and good friend.
I went to see him because I wanted answers about my father's death.
answers? - Yes, answers.
police said my father died in a car accident.
drunk driving? My dad's brother died because of a drunk driver.
there is no way he would have gotten behind the wheel if intoxicated.
investigation was swept under the rug.
my dad's unit was disbanded, and everybody walked away like nothing was wrong.
I was left with nothing.
okay, go on.
after I went to Hawaii...
I tracked Blake down, but he claimed he didn't know anything. That's it.
sergeant Blake died in a car accident this morning in Los Angeles.
now, if his death turns out to be more than a tragic misfortune, we're going to have a real problem.
Why's that?
because you'll be the prime suspect in his murder.
Donald Blye, dead, car accident.
Patrick Phearson, dead, car accident.
Peter Clairmont, died in 2006 working for a private contractor in Afghanistan.
any guesses how? - Survey says "car accident"?
Ding, ding, ding.
Jason Klemp, Ray Duvont, also dead, also car accidents.
so either these guys are the world's worst drivers or...
someone's taking 'em out.
three died within the past two months.
only one alive is Jay Fisher.
Jay Fisher is missing. No known address or number.
maybe he's the one who's behind all this.
maybe he's dead like all the rest but just hasn't been discovered yet.
why now, after all these years?
uh, guys, the last person to contact Duvont and Klemp before they died was Kensi.
just like Blake.
Granger thinks Kensi's involved.
give us everything you have on the sniper training unit, starting with Kensi's father.
it's all circumstantial.
but Blye was incinerated when his car ran off the road.
military police could only I. D. Blye's corpse using dental records.
the official finding was, Don Blye was killed in a drunk driving accident.
Kensi refused to accept it.
what are you trying to prove, Granger?
the sniper training unit was a cover story.
the unit was actually a black-ops team used for special missions.
so w-what's happening here? Is my partner under arrest?
agent Blye isn't under arrest, but she is a suspect.
it appears your partner only joined NCIS to track down those she believes are responsible for his death.
the men in her father's unit.
you're accusing Kensi of murder? - I'm saying, check the facts.
there's mounting evidence that ties Kensi to the deaths of those men.
Kensi is a first-rate agent with an impeccable record.
I don't buy it. - Well, others do.
including you.
facts are facts, Agent Hanna.
you're not buying this, are you, Hetty?
no, I am not, Mr. Deeks, but we will certainly review the facts.
it's all right there-- hard to disprove...
but I'm sure you'll try.
you've been conducting a secret investigation the entire time you've been here.
what's your point?
assistant Director, a word in my office, if you would.
of course.
gentlemen, there's work to be done.
let's start with Blake's car. - Keep us posted.
got it. - Yeah.
you have undermined my authority by keeping me in the dark, Owen.
if you suspected Agent Blye of anything, you should have come to me first.
well, I know what a tight-knit group this is.
any other method wouldn't have generated the same results.
Ah, results?
this is an elite team, and you've just thrown it into chaos.
I won't forget this.
I know.
LAPD is treating it as an accident for now, giving us a few minutes before they get started.
why'd Blake come to Los Angeles in the first place?
looking for Kensi?
she calls him, he hops on a flight to give her the information she was looking for?
Yeah, so pick up the phone, e-mail, send a text.
long way to travel just to talk. That's for sure.
if Kensi's right and her father was murdered,
Blake could have come over here to take her out before she found out the truth.
somebody took Blake out first.
bad news.
a small charge blew the brake line. Wasn't an accident.
which means Kensi is now officially a murder suspect.
only if we tell Granger.
when did you last contact Sergeant Blake?
you know what? Can we just stop this stupid dance routine and get to it?
Yes, I went to see Blake to talk about my father, but get it straight.
my dad was an honorable man, and the last thing I would do is dishonor his memory by becoming a killer.
your father wasn't the all-American hero you think he was.
special
you wanted answers.
what's in the file?
I wish I knew, Mr. Deeks.
I mean, there's go to be something we can do here.
don't worry. I'll take care of her.
there has to be something on Blake's phone.
you did say you went to MIT, right?
I'm in, but there's a series of calls I can't get a lock on for some reason.
so you're really not in.
I thought you said you could do this in your sleep.
in my sleep, I don't have people breathing down my neck.
except for that one dream.
if you don't hurry up, it's gonna turn into a nightmare.
too late.
focus, Beale, you got this.
Kensi's holding her own, but Granger's about this close to putting her in a torture rack.
what's taking so long? - Got it.
now wonder it was so difficult, the calls all originate from a federal agency account.
which agency? - CIA.
the number's blocked, but it definitely leads back to their network.
you'd miss it if you didn't know what to look for.
not bad for MIT.
call CIA's Los Angeles field office.
see if they'll cooperate and give us a name.
if they don't, hack them.
looks like there are more calls on Blake's phone to a user logged under the single name "Fish.
that could be his unit buddy. Jay Fisher? - Good chance.
looks like a burn phone, but I've got a phone number.
well, if it is Fisher, he called David Blake this morning.
phone has since been disconnected.
not so fast.
looks like the majority of the calls originate from a cell tower in Highland Park.
silver Dollar trailer park is the closest residence in the area.
good work.
okay. Ouch.
did you guys ever think about getting maybe a sedan? You know?
maybe a nice minivan? One of those sliding doors.
ever thought about walking?
find out what? I didn't find anything. You find something?
you mean other than the gaping hole in its side?
what's there to find out?
I wasn't even there.
no? - No.
so how do you think the CIA's involved in all this?
not a clue.
I'm more concerned Fisher lured Blake to L. A. to kill him.
and is Kensi next on his list?
they all look the same.
how are we supposed to know which one's Fisher's?
that one.
other trailers are unkempt. That one's fairly squared away.
trenching tool.
mres.
more like MR-ews.
after a few weeks living off the earth, you'd kill for one of those.
federal agents.
it's all clear. No sign of struggle.
Eric, we're at the Silver Dollar trailer park in Highland Park.
check and see if there's any security camera footage of the last 24 hours.
silver Dollar. Got it.
I found something.
what, are you one of the Hardy Boys? - More like Nancy Drew.
you can laugh it up, boys, but check that out.
he's got a date. What do you think that is?
Alexander, shelter, 5:30.
could be anywhere.
what do you got, Eric?
security footage from the trailer park shows a ton of people coming in and out over the last 24 hours.
it could take days to go through all of this.
there is one familiar face that stands out.
what about marine sniper school?
it was a cover story.
your father was a member of an elite black-ops unit specializing in irregular rendition.
let me guess, his, uh, constant trips for work wasn't to train American allies, then?
no.
it was for eliminating threats to American national security.
so what you're saying is my father was an assassin?
Oh, of course not.
the United States doesn't sanction political assassination.
you wanted to know the truth.
what, that my father never truly revealed himself to me?
thank you very much for that.
must run in the family.
am I free to go now?
report on Blake's car isn't in yet, so you can come and go as you please.
you knew? - No, I did not.
so, I assume the purpose of that ludicrous exhibition was to
what-- examine her reaction?
she's a seasoned undercover agent. You heard her, she has motive.
if this were anyone else, it wouldn't be an issue.
you are wrong on this, Owen.
let me explain something to you.
if it turns out that Blye's responsible for these murders,
director Vance has no option but to consider your team compromised and disbanded.
keep
you know the convenience store around the corner really sucks.
all they had was stale coffee and fuzzy doughnuts.
Deeks, it's not a good time.
it would be kind of a pity to waste a mediocre cup of coffee.
here, just hold it, and then I'll...
Deeks... - Oh, sorry about that.
God, I can't believe you just fell for that.
just, uh, so you know, you've got two undercover agents outside watching you.
Yes, I know.
and just to clarify, when did you start moonlighting as a hit man?
I mean, you got the whole federal agent by day and killer by night.
I mean, it really does have summer blockbuster written all over it.
well, if it were true, guess who my next victim would be?
no, no, no!
it was my dad's.
that doesn't explain what you're doing with it. - I was cleaning it.
Why?
what have you guys got so far?
subject change. I'll play along.
david Blake's car was tampered with.
his brake lines were rigged with a small explosive.
looks like he was murdered.
you don't think it was... - Not for a second.
why hasn't Granger arrested me?
cause we haven't told him yet.
thought we could buy ourselves a little bit of time, but Forensics is eventually gonna find it.
I realize that this is the point in the conversation when I say something profound and life-affirming, so I actually... came prepared.
everything is gonna be fine.
that's... - That's it?
seemed longer when I was writing it. Probably sounds better, like, in Latin.
it's more profound if I say it...
but you're laughing, so it obviously worked.
Yeah.
there's a lot about what's going on that I haven't told you.
but I'm your partner; you can tell me anything.
I haven't told you to protect you.
because there are...
are you gonna get that?
wasn't planning on it.
just two seconds. It's Deeks.
Yeah, no, I got it. - All right.
okay.
what? - That was Hetty.
LAPD discovered that Blake's car was rigged.
I go to bring you in.
so, the CIA, surprisingly cooperative.
once Hetty made a call.
uh, the other number Blake called this morning was to a CIA employee named Alex Harris.
Deeks found the name Alex at Fisher's trailer.
Harris currently has a position as a foreign policy analyst, but back in the '90s, he was the handler for Donald Blye's black-ops unit.
why didn't Granger mention Harris earlier?
Where's Alex Harris now?
that's where CIA cooperation ended.
once they suspected Harris was mixed up in something, they shut us down.
Harris might be taking out members of his own team.
they might have had something on him.
and Kensi snooping around set him in motion.
thank you, Detective Deeks.
I didn't do this for you, Granger.
bad news, Agent Blye.
forensics team figured out David Blake's car was sabotaged.
it's funny how two trained agents and an LAPD detective missed that.
well, we're only human.
orders from D. C. I have to take you into custody.
I'm not going anywhere.
you're going to a secure location where you will not have access to NCIS intel or personnel.
you're the assistant director.
you're telling me you can't hold off on this until we solve it?
there's this thing called protocol.
you all seem to have forgotten what it is.
think of it as protective custody.
are we really gonna let this happen? I mean, think about what you're saying.
this doesn't make any sense. Why would I kill Blake?
I need a moment with Ms. Blye.
of course.
excuse me, sir.
the director would like to know if you intend to bring charges.
tell the director that is a distinct possibility, Agent Clookie.
Yes, sir. - Thank you.
we seem to find ourselves in a bit of a pinch.
but I want you to know that you are not alone.
Hetty, I didn't do this.
I know, Kensi. We'll do all we can.
agent Blye? We have to go.
go.
he's actually going through with this.
what is it, Eric?
uh, Fisher's burn phone went back online.
I tracked him to the old theater district downtown.
it's a good place to hide out.
keep feeding us coordinates.
looks like Kensi's been requesting files related to her father's death for years.
well, according to this, all the files Kensi requested were routed through the same desk at the DOD.
Granger's.
if Granger's known for years that Kensi's been digging into the mystery of her father's death, they why wouldn't he tell us?
I am not liking the sound of this.
according to his last transmission, you guys should be right on top of him.
Fisher's GPS went out, but he's somewhere inside the old Los Angeles theater.
got it, Eric.
he's in the building. You cover left, cover right, I'll go up.
clear.
clear.
G? - It's Fisher.
go.
that is not a good way to go out.
you think Fisher's death will convince Granger of Kensi's innocence?
I mean, Kensi's in custody, right?
she couldn't possibly have remote-detonated that bomb.
Deeks, there's a half a dozen different ways that bomb could have detonated.
none of which would require Kensi to be there to trigger the device.
I know. I just thought we could slide one over on Granger.
don't worry, Deeks. We're gonna get her out of this.
maybe we can pull something off of this.
fisher must have dropped it when you guys were brawling.
I know that look.
the job is done.
fisher was the last living member of Donald Blye's unit.
if I was Alex Harris, I'd be on a flight right now.
then, we're going to need a miracle to find him.
hello. - Eric, I'm calling you from Fisher's phone.
see if he contacted Alex Harris from it. We may be able to locate him if he did.
there are several repeating numbers.
one of them traces back to David Blake, and another one is... untraceable. Probably Harris.
nothing's untraceable. We just have to get creative.
maybe we're overthinking this. Why not just call Harris from Fisher's phone?
if Harris killed Fisher, why would he answer Fisher's call?
curiosity.
if Harris didn't kill Fisher, he'd probably answer.
but that would mean Kensi...
maybe we get lucky. Right?
look, if Harris answers, we can lock in and track him.
make the call, Eric.
what now? - We keep looking.
tuna or turkey?
I'm not hungry. Agent Carter, right? - Yeah.
I need you to make an important call for me.
it's not going to happen.
I have to get some information to my team that could help them solve this case.
it's against protocol.
what if she's telling the truth?
what if she isn't? Granger would kill us.
people are dying.
if there is a chance that we could save a life, then you have to make this call for me. Please.
sorry, Agent Blye. It's against protocol.
so what now?
we know Fisher was meeting Harris, but where?
well, Eric and Nell couldn't find much on Fisher.
Yeah, but Kensi did. She was able to track Fisher to the trailer park.
maybe she has more information.
kind of hard to ask her. Granger's got her holed up.
well, maybe the info's on her computer.
I doubt she would keep that sort of thing at work.
maybe it's her home computer.
shotgun! Called it.
I called it-- shotgun!
Seriously?
get in.
just your basic stuff.
bills, magazines, gossip sites.
could be a protected file.
Ah. Hidden directory. Well, it's password-protected.
try "king of the world," all caps, no spaces.
titanic's her favorite movie.
what? I'm a detective. I detect.
yeah? You'll detect a black eye if you've been on my computer.
we're in. - Yeah.
Fisher-- there.
okay. It looks like Fisher was a paranoid survivalist.
moved around a lot.
stockpiled a lot of gear and different supplies.
sounds familiar.
all right, she had surveillance on the trailer park.
the theater downtown.
civil defense shelter in Highland Park.
civil defense shelter? Hold on a second.
the note is: "Alexander, shelter, 5:30.
could be where Fisher was meeting Harris.
worth checking out. - Let's do it.
bomb shelter?
doesn't look like it would stop a sake bomb.
must be fortified inside.
Kensi's no fool.
she was obviously casing this place for a reason.
all right, what kind of paranoid nutcase has a bomb shelter?
I have one. - What?
Yeah. Me and my family can stay there for months.
I didn't... I didn't mean you. I thought maybe...
I have one, too.
just because you squat there from time to time doesn't make it yours.
Hey, it's me and you against him. That's how it works.
sorry. Habit. I have one.
Hey, listen, uh, can you guys do me a favor?
maybe not scream out "federal agents" this time?
cause that's usually when they tend to start shooting.
look at the dust.
same here.
federal agents!
prove it! Toss out your badge!
well, that has got to be the first time that's ever worked.
carefully!
I'm coming out!
let me see your hands! Let me see your hands!
you need to get me into protective custody now.
walk towards me.
hands on the wall.
are you really not going to call my team?
sorry, Agent Blye, I can't break protocol.
then, I'm sorry, too.
should have followed your instincts.
Jay Fisher was killed today.
we think it was you.
gentlemen, I'm sure you're good at what you do, but no way in hell I go on record with three cameras, a parabolic mic, and probably a class-five fiber-optic scope pointed at me.
someone's out there whacking members of your old team.
we could release you and let you talk to them if you'd prefer.
you could, but then Blye's daughter never finds out the truth.
I'll talk, just not on record.
okay.
what is it that you want?
protection. - In exchange for?
I'll tell you everything I know but only to Blye's daughter at a location of my choice.
what's in it for you?
redemption.
why do you care so much about Kensi Blye?
she deserves to know the truth about her father.
well, pick up or delivery?
Kensi, that is, not lunch. I'm gonna go get her.
no, you won't.
you're gonna have to bring her in.
Harris isn't going to talk without her.
I will not let a suspect dictate the direction of this investigation.
for all we know, he could be trying to kill Agent Blye.
Oh, I thought you believed Kensi was trying to kill him.
we know about you giving Kensi access to her father's files.
that's right up to SECNAV.
I don't know what the game is that you're playing, but you're gonna lose.
is that a veiled threat, Agent Hanna?
I don't do veiled.
fine, we'll bring her in.
Yeah, it's Granger. - Assistant Director, Agent Blye has escaped.
how? - She... she got the jump on us, sir.
agent Blye has escaped.
what happened, and I want specifics.
sorry. They wouldn't let me call you guys, and I didn't...
no, no, no, no, no. We don't have time for that.
there's a lot of damning evidence here.
I've seen careers more mature than yours ruined over less, but they weren't nearly as strong as you are.
why you came to NCIS isn't important.
it's what you do moving forward from here.
you're not who your past says you are.
you're who you choose to be.
Callen, Sam, and Deeks have tracked down Alex Harris.
he was the handler for your father's black-ops team.
well, then, I want to talk to him.
good. He wants to speak with you, but only you.
we don't want to test Harris. He's too savvy.
that means no wires, no comms.
we'll be blind.
you don't have to do this, Kensi. - Oh, but I do.
if I don't, I may never find the truth.
you'll need this. A girl has to take steps to protect herself.
thank you.
please be careful.
I will.
do we have satellite access?
I won't have picture for another 45 minutes, but I found something else.
Granger has an e-trail as long as Hetty's, and it all looks by-the-numbers until I cross-referenced Granger's file with the Donald Blye case.
Granger and Harris were in the same division at the CIA.
soon as we prove Kensi's innocence, we're going after Granger.
deal.
just to clarify, if anything happens to Kensi, you're gonna be dealing with me for the rest of your soon-to-be-very-short life.
your boss know about you two?
you're either lying to yourself, or you're hiding from it.
either way, son, makes the job harder.
I hope Kensi's got her head in the game.
she's been in worse jams.
physically, yes, but not after learning that mostly everything she knew about her father was wrong.
nothing is worse than not knowing.
talking about Kensi or you?
what if the answers you find aren't the ones you're looking for?
you know the motto that's engraved at CIA headquarters in Langley?
John 8: 32. "Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
Amen.
what are you doing? Is there a problem?
I'm just making sure we're not being watched or followed.
I don't like it.
we don't have ears or eyes.
no, couldn't take the chance. Kensi can handle herself.
I know. Doesn't mean I have to like it.
do we have eyes, Mr. Beale?
we still need six to eight minutes.
let me be clear.
I will not hesitate to kill you.
I expect nothing less. It's in your blood.
why'd you kill Blake and Fisher? - I didn't.
Blake came to L. A. to meet with Fisher and me so we could try and figure out a way to stay alive.
from who?
you, we thought at first.
I know what happened to your father.
he didn't die in a car accident, he was murdered.
his death was staged to look like an accident.
the man that's killing off the team is the same man that killed your father.
okay, who is he? What's his name?
after he takes me out, he's coming for you.
what is his name?!
very nice.
fire!
that'll be a dud, gentlemen.
sergeant Revis, I got an unexploded M1-HE that I need cleared from my field ASAP.
sounds rockin'.
we'll wake up the PackBot and blow your projectile the hell out of here.
come on, Andy, push that crap on out the way.
this is a damn three-foot-long, high explosive shell.
now, why can't I see it, Corporal?
Hey, w-w-wait, go back.
I didn't see it.
back up the damn robot.
backing up.
all right, l look right.
right.
move in.
moving in.
you see that?
Oh, my God.
I thought Hetty said no more games on the big screen.
please don't say anything.
I need some advantage.
I used to be so good at this game.
what happened, you lose your killer mojo?
no, this guy Hotshot7 came into my theater.
he follows me everywhere, kills me before I can even get a shot off.
he did it again.
war sucks.
Yes, it does.
message Text Want to video chat, dog?
Ooh, Hotshot7 wants to talk.
bet he wants to talk some smack in person.
okay.
did we not have this discussion, Mr. Beale?
you are Hotshot7?
I thought you'd be...
taller?
why do you keep killing me?
because that's the purpose of the game, Mr. Beale, and if I catch you playing it in OPS again, the carnage will be for real.
Mr. Callen and Mr. Hanna, if you will, for his own good, disarm Mr. Beale.
sorry, Eric, Hetty's orders.
gonna have to take the Xbox.
no, please, don't.
come on, come on.
it's the cameras in here.
Hetty watched your every move the minute you made it.
she cheated.
all's fair in love and war, baby.
ensign Aaron Powell.
his body was found in the impact zone at the Los Cerritos Training Base.
he was a communications specialist who worked with several special operations units in Afghanistan.
a lot of classified information passed through those hands.
get down to the base, see if there's been a breach in security.
that's what I'm talking about.
little road trip?
we can all go down together.
eating junk food, talking about our feelings.
got some, Kenny Loggins on CD.
separate cars.
no, what? Come on.
what... what about a little "Footloose,"a little "This is It"?
Callen, Sam, wait up.
what?
got the car to yourself again.
works every time.
what sort of base is this?
chief Hanna.
recognized you from your SEAL unit photos.
lieutenant Commander Westerman, Task Force Delta.
well it's Agent Hanna now.
this is my partner Agent Callen.
nice to meet you. Hi. - Deeks.
agent Blye.
when I heard you were coming, I requested to be the liaison.
I've heard a lot about you.
some of it good, I hope.
you're a bit of a legend.
bosnia, Iraq.
Yeah, well, it's nice to be remembered.
how can I help?
what do you know about Ensign Powell?
heard some rumors he might have been a drug user, but don't take my word for it.
I don't know if he went out there and fell asleep or what.
it's crazy.
we'll start with Powell's unit.
got it. - Ensign McCarty will show you to the communications department.
so, what about the body?
M. E. has it.
she's waiting to speak to you.
I'll show you over there.
the MPs still can't find his right lower leg or his left hand.
the body had massive concussive injuries.
high explosive round will do that to you.
the thing is, he didn't die from the artillery fire.
he was stabbed.
thought it was a shrapnel wound at first, but there was no metal in the laceration, and judging by the lividity, he died hours before his body was moved out to the impact zone.
it's a good place to dump a body.
you get one direct artillery hit, there's nothing left to find.
the shape of the blade curves forward.
I sketched the outline.
that's a karambit knife.
shaped like the canine tooth of a tiger.
the funny thing is, from the irritation of the skin, I'd say that the wound was dressed at some point.
aside from the tox screen, I'll get you my preliminary autopsy report tomorrow.
his right shoulder was pulled from the socket?
Yes, he, he bled into the joint, so it happened while he was still alive.
how'd you know?
okay, talk to me.
seals love knives.
like to have 'em custom forged for their units.
different SEAL teams learn their restraint and fighting techniques from different combat schools, so the bruises on Powell's body are like a signature.
you think Ensign Powell was murdered by a Navy SEAL?
no. SEALs wouldn't do that.
I bet my life on it.
okay.
there's a lot of copycats in the world.
a lot of people move through those combat schools.
and anybody can buy a custom knife.
so not exactly the friendliest place.
hello.
Nell, I need you to reach out to a guy named Glen Olmos.
he made custom combat knives for a lot of the SEAL teams.
he's in Long Beach.
M. E. is about to send you a sketch.
I want you to send that sketch to Olmos, see what he can tell us.
okay, got it.
we spoke to Powell's unit.
he's a little bit of a player, liked to party.
no one would confirm the drug rumor.
Powell was also involved in a scuffle in a bar with a petty officer, David Hodgkins.
evidently, Powell started dating David Hodgkins' ex-girlfriend.
could be a motive.
petty Officer Hodgkins on base?
Yeah, we figured you'd want to handle the interview.
Why?
because he's a SEAL.
what can I do for you?
we need to speak with your SEAL team.
most of my team is stationed in Afghanistan.
what's this about?
ensign Powell's murder.
you accusing Navy SEALs of murder?
is that what I'm hearing?
only six members of my team are still here, but they're on the tarmac now.
they're about to embark on a highly classified rescue mission.
well, I need you to hold that plane until we've had a chance to speak with them.
let me explain this to you, Agent Callen, give you a chance to back off your position.
you have security clearance.
my men are going to the Hindu Kush on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.
two Americans were kidnapped last month.
she's a CIA field agent and a good one who's put her life on the line for the last eight years.
also taken hostage was Mark Rowe, a civilian military contractor.
I've heard of Rowe.
you should.
he's a former SEAL.
they're going to get one of their own back.
once a SEAL, always a SEAL.
you should know that, Agent Hanna.
protocol dictates there's a backup team ready to step in.
these are the caves where we have reconnaissance photos of the hostages.
it's a maze of tunnels.
16 months ago, these same six men took those tunnels and occupied them for four days.
so those six SEALs are the only men who know these tunnels well enough to execute the rescue.
the Taliban are moving Rowe and Davis every three days.
they've been in this location now almost 45 hours.
given it will take the team 18 hours to fly there and get into position...
got roughly a seven-hour window to get the team back on the plane.
let's not cut it that close, Agent Hanna.
we'll get them back on mission as fast as possible.
you know what you're asking me to do.
commander, please make the call.
who's Agent Callen?
that's me.
you'd better have a damn good reason for pulling my men off that plane.
I do.
need to ask you and your men some questions.
about what?
about the murder of Ensign Aaron Powell.
guy's dead.
hostages are alive.
questions can wait till we get back.
couple hours of your time is all we need.
chief, Special Agent Hanna-- he's one of us.
D. O.D. wants this taken care of now.
is he suggesting that one of my team is a murderer?
just got a job to do, Chief. - Why doesn't he answer?
say it to my face-- we're murderers?
stand down. - I'm calling the MPs.
mps aren't going to help you. - Stand down!
all right, I'm ready for my close-up, Ms. Lange.
good connection, Mr. Deeks.
Mr. Hanna, are you ready?
let's start with Chief Petty Officer Green.
what do you know about Ensign Powell?
barely knew him.
he occasionally worked with my team providing communications services.
ensign Powell was murdered last night between 6: 00 and 10: 00 p. m.
where were you?
I was at the movies in Long Beach with my team.
What'd you see?
it was called Netscape.
what was it about?
guy took over people's lives, stole their identity via the Internet.
you can ask my men.
and they'll back you up.
I'm sure somebody saw us at the theater.
Hodgkins is an extraordinary sailor and human being.
I fought shoulder to shoulder with David for six years.
okay, I'll ask that question again.
are you aware of the altercation?
no.
I have no knowledge of any altercation.
that's the truth?
I thought SEALs had integrity.
I've lost seven men.
three maimed.
one of my men is blind, trying to provide for two kids by folding towels in a hotel.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm not sure I understand your point.
makes it a little hard to have to sit here and listen to you question our integrity.
you go to hell, Agent Callen.
this conversation is terminated.
with all respect...what happened at the end of the film?
you ever serve in the military, Agent Callen?
no.
bad guy fell in love with the girl whose identity he stole.
had a change of heart.
you didn't even ask a question.
are we gonna do this or not?
I respect them.
I honor them, Sam.
but SEALs are not beyond reproach.
they won't talk to you.
the questions themselves are an affront to them.
but questions from a fellow SEAL are not.
we need to clear them fast.
if they don't talk to us, two innocent people are gonna die.
I need to do this alone.
you want Petty Officer Hodgkins brought in?
let's let Sam have the room.
send him in.
how long you been a SEAL?
seven years.
seen a lot?
enough.
too much?
I don't believe so.
I didn't think so, either.
until I got out.
your former girlfriend, Justine Samamara...
she leave you?
she wanted a family.
I wasn't there.
I was deployed ten months of the year.
timing wasn't gonna work.
you were angry?
sad.
not angry.
I felt I owed more to my country before I started that part of my life.
then why'd you get in a fight with Powell when he started dating her?
Powell was a jerk.
I saw him chatting up another girl at the bar.
I told him not to hurt Justine.
we had words, pushed each other, that was it.
that was it?
that was it.
what's so urgent?
according to the security tapes, Ensign Powell left the training base at 16: 08 yesterday afternoon, and returned 16: 40.
that's a quick trip.
we picked up his car parked outside a strip mall in Cyprus.
this is Powell heading into the mailbox store.
he's accessing a mailbox that he's been renting for the last four months.
he's an envelope into his mailbox?
you don't put mail into those.
no, you rent them to receive mail.
ten minutes ago, we saw this.
it's a dead drop.
well, if Powell is dealing drugs, could be how he's making his buy.
if that's what this is all about.
we've pulled the license on their car.
address is on your phones.
that's the license.
they're home.
Deeks, take the back; Kensi come with me.
federal agents! Please open the door!
One...two...
garage. - Let's go.
got an ID, Eric?
the IDs indicated they were Mexican nationals, but they were fakes.
keep looking.
also, Ensign Powell had an account and a safety deposit box at a bank in Cerritos.
only $300 in the account.
get a warrant and get that safety deposit box opened, Miss Jones.
right. - What about Sam's knife guy?
I gave him the info, but he only wants to talk to Sam.
okay.
I understand.
it's printing out now.
all right.
Olmos made ten karambit knives like this.
one was sold to a member of Green's SEAL team.
it matches the wound's dimensions exactly.
I'll have MPs search the grounds.
none of the SEAL team have left the base since Powell was killed.
there's a good chance the knife's still here.
who did he make it for?
petty Officer Doug Foster.
Yes, sir, I did my training at Dam Neck.
with Lieutenant Henry Carr.
Yes. He spoke of you on several occasions.
he's a good teacher.
lieutenant Carr said you were a man who we should aspire to emulate.
lieutenant Carr is also a good man.
it's like we're making him interrogate his family.
we are.
do you own a combat knife called a karambit?
I used to.
I lost it clearing house in Kandahar.
we believe Ensign Powell was killed with a karambit knife.
that's a common knife among military personnel.
well, thank you for your time, PO Foster.
sure.
appreciate it.
my pleasure.
Oh, go to the movies last night?
Yes, sir.
what happened at the end of the movie?
this, um, this guy was stealing a female's identity.
started to like the female.
he had, uh, a change of heart, I guess.
okay.
Thanks.
find me somebody that saw them at the movie last night. - Okay.
Callen, this is Heather Linden.
she worked the candy counter last night.
she's a consummate professional who agrees with me that Sour Patch Kids are indeed the best movie candy, too.
Heather saw Green's SEAL team at the theater last night.
are they in trouble?
well, we're trying to make sure that they're not.
you're sure you saw all of them last night?
Yeah, they were flirting with a bunch of us.
and did you see them after the show as well?
they tried to get us to go with them and party.
you didn't want to take them up on that?
kind of handsome.
a little old.
Ouch.
a couple of them had wedding bands.
I really think they were just fooling around.
you really don't have good judgment, do you?
everyone knows that Junior Mints are the best movie candy.
What'd she say?
they were there before and after the show.
she says they were flirting with her.
so, his story checks out. - Sam, three of these guys are married.
just doesn't sound like the guys we've been talking to.
we also checked the theater. There's six exits, four more in the lobby.
I mean, these guys are trained to get in and out of countries.
getting out of there undetected after lights go down, that'd be easy.
now, flirting with the girls assures them of being noticed.
they got an alibi.
come on, Sam, they're SEALs.
let's start with the perimeter fence.
I'll check it out.
okay, drive another 20 feet.
okay, stop. All right, stop right there.
directly in front of you, there's a 14-foot corridor.
it's not monitored by any of the base's cameras.
this is where they'd enter.
it's also a single-layer fence.
Yeah, it's scheduled to be doubled, but the work order hasn't been completed.
who's going to tell Sam?
I will.
the fence was cut.
new, no corrosion.
we know the weapon they had, we know they had access, and it appears they worked as a team.
everything is circumstantial.
you want to stop their mission with no physical evidence?
what's the motive?
getting with another guy's girl.
but units have strict codes about that.
not the SEALs.
that story doesn't hold water, and you know it.
regular military kill for jealousy, maybe.
not these men.
Sam... these guys did it.
I'm sorry, guys. Hetty wants to conference.
I have some disturbing news.
we also got access to Powell's safety-deposit box.
there were four envelopes, each containing $12, 000 in cash.
so, Powell was selling information to Pakistan. You were right.
seals don't kill for jealousy.
but they would kill a traitor.
the window is closing on the lives of the hostages.
once they're moved, in all likelihood, we're not gonna get another shot at them.
two hours and 15 minutes. We're well aware of the clock, Commander.
then you're releasing my team?
ensign Powell was selling intelligence, most likely about your SEALs, to I. S.I. agents in Los Angeles.
you're sure? - Yes.
then you need to turn over everything you know about the breach in security.
we will.
and release my team. - We can't do that, sir.
if this mission has been compromised, it's D. O.D.'s and my call whether to continue.
your men are being held as suspects in the death of Ensign Powell.
what are you trying to do here, Agent Hanna?
they will be arrested and taken into custody.
then understand this.
the lives of two Americans are on your head.
I am well aware of the consequences, Commander.
Sam? Petty Officer Foster wants to talk to you.
he says it's urgent.
you got something to tell me? - I want to make a confession.
I knew that the only person down the chain of command with access to this information was Ensign Powell.
I know what you're doing. Don't do it.
I followed Powell.
saw him meet with two men and receive an envelope.
then, last night... - You left the movie theater by yourself?
told my team I wasn't feeling well and stepped out.
I returned to base through the fence.
I confronted Powell, he drew a weapon, we fought, and I stabbed him.
the wound was not critical.
I dressed it, I searched his room, found a large sum of cash in his footlocker, confirming he was the individual selling classified information.
it was then I realized he was not breathing.
I performed CPR, but he did not respond.
so, you let him bleed out?
I don't know. I... I don't believe so.
I was... I was just going to question Powell, and find out what other intel he had revealed, detain him 48 hours until after the mission was completed.
but you didn't get him any medical attention, and he died.
I'm trained in combat medicine. I did not believe his wound was critical.
then you moved him to the impact zone... by yourself?
I acted alone. - No! I'm not buying it.
I acted alone. - You were part of a team.
you all went to the movies, you all made up the alibi, and you all came back to the base.
listen to me.
you're giving up everything for men who had a part in this.
your career is over. You're going to prison.
negligent homicide!
by confessing my crime, I am protecting the mission.
I am a Navy SEAL. It's what we do.
Hey, Kaleidoscope just got a hit on the wounded I. S.I. agent's car.
it's parked at a motel in Compton.
notify Kensi and Deeks.
Yeah. Eric, we got it.
chief Green told me Foster confessed.
you have your suspect. This is over.
he's taking the fall for them.
what about the mission?
we came here for the truth, Commander, not a scapegoat.
I'll get Hetty.
wait.
I'm waiting.
I got something.
but I got to do it alone. You can't be a part of it.
please.
okay.
bring them all in the room.
clear. - Clear.
Deeks? - Yeah?
I've got a laptop.
Thanks.
Eric, he left his laptop. Looks like he wiped it clean. We'll get it back to you.
funny, there was no Internet in the room.
he needs to use a secure connection in order to send the intelligence.
Why?
because Pakistan is our ally.
they supposedly don't have any agents operating in the United States.
just like we supposedly don't have any agents operating in Pakistan.
as I said, a secure connection.
can never trace it back to him.
okay, so, scanning the area, I got a business that's been red-flagged by Homeland Security.
it's a Pakistan communications company with secure satellite access.
sending you the address now.
on it.
you all left the movie theater, cut the fence, reentered the base.
you restrained, questioned and killed Ensign Powell.
then disposed of his body in the impact zone.
petty Officer Torres, how'd that movie end?
this guy was stealing identities, and then in the end, he fell for the girl, tried to get with her, and he had a change of heart. - Change of heart. Yeah.
you men seem to have your story together.
two people are about to die. You have a confession!
that's not my knife.
how do you know without looking at it?
I told you, I lost it clearing a house in Kandahar.
but you confessed that you used it on Ensign Powell.
that was a different knife.
so now we have two knives?
whose fingerprints are going to be on this if it's not your knife?
I... have a... - Stop talking.
it's a duplicate knife. - It's too late!
story's falling apart, gentlemen. It's over!
you happy? - No.
because to me, being a SEAL means honor and integrity.
it means something.
we would never shame ourselves by compromising the truth.
you want it?
Really?
that's why I'm here.
seal to SEAL.
agent Callen, I hope your partner knows what he's doing.
he's doing what he has to do.
no cameras.
no one hears what's said in this room.
seal to SEAL.
someone turns against you on the battlefield, you kill him.
might even get a medal for it.
but now it's in your backyard, and suddenly, it's unpalatable.
you could have turned him in. - We were going to.
after the mission had been completed.
if we revealed the breach in security, the mission could have been terminated.
they are going to behead that woman.
you know that.
mark Rowe. Former SEAL.
I served two years with him.
he has a wife and a child, and even with that, Mark would have died for me.
we had our mission.
Powell was the enemy. The choice was clear.
to kill him. - No, absolutely not.
everything that Petty Officer Foster told you was the truth.
we entered his room. Powell wasn't there; we split up to search for him.
I found him outside smoking.
Powell knew it was over.
he drew his side arm. We struggled.
I stabbed him.
it was in self-defense.
the wound was not critical.
we gave him medical attention and searched his room.
then he stopped breathing.
all on his own?
as far as we could determine, yes.
and none of you felt any malice or vengeance for a man who put the entire team in danger.
betraying his country for money?
it was all for the mission?
what's in your heart when you confront the enemy, Chief Hanna?
this is it. Back door's open.
Eric, you sure he's in there?
zoom in.
Yeah, it looks like he went in five minutes ago. He's there.
detective, that transmission cannot be uploaded.
we're a go/no-go, Agent Hanna.
either they leave now, or the mission is aborted.
you have your confession.
our team has eyes on the I. S.I. agent.
this mission's been compromised. You really gonna send your guys in there?
federal agents! - Don't move!
Eric, it's uploading.
I don't think I can stop it.
it's okay. I got it. - Subtle.
Eric, any of that come through?
I don't know. It was a secure connection.
Mr. Callen? The transmission was terminated.
we don't know if any information was uploaded.
okay.
transmission was stopped, but we don't know if it got through.
it doesn't matter. We're going anyway.
what's it gonna be?
are my men getting on that plane?
finding no physical evidence,
I have no suspects at this time in the death of Ensign Powell.
put your team on a plane.
including Petty Officer Foster.
that plane better be fueled and ready.
wheels up in ten.
you director aware of your findings?
get your men on the plane. Quickly.
this could cost you everything.
right.
let's get out of here.
chief Green?
bring them home.
we'll do our best.
so... publicly the Pakistan government is denying any involvement.
they are claiming that their former agents had gone rogue.
yeah?
my office, Mr. Hanna.
you made a huge decision without my authority.
I did what I had to do.
how do we proceed from here?
I believe there's not enough evidence to proceed at this time.
what about Petty Officer Foster's confession?
the recording system malfunctioned.
there's no record of a confession.
petty Officer Foster has nothing else to say at this time.
I cannot allow those men to walk away.
no. You cannot.
I understand what you have to do.
Hey, satellite's up, feed is live.
all team members, contact left, contact left!
I'm hit! I'm hit!
I think that's Hodgkins.
I can't walk! I can't walk! Go! Go!
does anyone have eyes on Two?
I say again: Does anyone have eyes on Two?
it's not a game.
three Platoon, Three Platoon.
no, it's not.
contact. Contact.
Powell was an asthmatic.
his mouth was taped. He was stressed. He probably had an attack.
the wound didn't kill him.
autopsy just came in, confirmed it.
agent Hanna didn't know this. - But that's just the thing.
he did, Hetty.
he knew the character of those men.
we're not judge and jury.
he allowed suspects in a murder case to walk. He destroyed evidence.
Yes, he did.
Sam would die for what's right.
he may have just done that, Mr. Callen.
forward fire from all directions.
31, I need a sitrep.
two's down! Two's down! I need evac.
requesting medevac.
what's happening? - Hodgkins can't walk.
I do not have eyes on the packages.
I say again, I do not have eyes on the packages.
I'm hit! I'm hit! - That's Foster.
foster's down.
sergeant One, I need a sitrep now.
ambush! Ambush!
we don't know if the transmission got through. They may be compromised.
taliban knew they were coming.
all team on deck. All team on deck. You copy? Over.
do you read me? Over.
look.
right there, that's Green. That's Rowe.
and that's Loretta Davis.
that could have been a trap.
but those men went anyway.
that's what we do.
Mr. Hanna.
I'll take care of this.
thank you.
no, Mr. Hanna.
thank you.
detective Williams, this is Special Agent Callen.
are you telling me Comescu is in Hawaii?
we found his prints at a murder scene.
he may have gotten his hands on a smallpox virus.
we're on our way.
Dracul is not an idealogue.
our guess is that he found a buyer looking for a biological weapon.
what the hell is this? - Looks like a quarantine station.
we did find smallpox virus samples but not all of them.
apparently several vials are missing.
the vials you recovered from Comescu did not contain smallpox.
it wasn't us, I swear to you. The doctor was gone.
what doctor? - Jarrod Prodeman
he's a formerly highly respected epidemiologist.
our suspect is on the mainland with nine vials of smallpox.
I need Hetty to send a team to LAX right now.
ladies and gentlemen, as we begin our descent, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright position.
your seat belt should be securely fastened and all carry-on luggage should be stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins.
please turn off all electronic devices until we are safely parked at the gate. Thank you.
excuse me, we're on final approach. You need to take your seat and buckle in.
Hello, can you hear me?
the other passengers say she's been in there for a while.
hang on, I'll get the key.
Oh, my God.
suspect's name is Jarrod Prodeman.
he's traveling from Hawaii to Los Angeles on board Hanalei Air flight 792.
he switched boarding passes with a man named Benjamin Gallagher in order to travel with an unidentified female companion.
he could be carrying a biochemical weapon, and so...
how long ago? Damn it.
what is going on with this equipment? - Problem?
Yeah, I'm trying to contact Callen, but the communication keeps freezing and nothing I do seems to help.
okay, let me take a look. - We don't have time for this.
you're right, but we also don't have time to make mistakes, - so let's just take a step back. Okay? - Okay.
try it now.
Callen? Callen, can you hear me?
see? What about you? Did you get in touch with the flight crew?
no, the plane already landed. - Oh, my God.
don't worry. Kensi and Deeks are at the airport.
this is a disaster.
I can't believe the one time we want a flight delayed, the freaking thing's on time.
try it again. - Callen? Sam? Does anybody copy?
come on! - Really?
Oh, shoot, it worked. You need to do it again.
don't tell Hetty.
pilot says he's going to shake the rivets loose if he pushes any harder.
well, that's why they invented parachutes.
uh, the civilians on board prefer to land in one piece if that's okay with you.
you've never jumped out of a plane?
no, I've never jumped out of a plane on purpose.
I've also never been involved in a blood feud either, so...
well... unless you count your mother-in-law.
how does that even happen, anyway? - It's a Romani thing.
you're a Gypsy? - Callen. Callen.
uh, we're here, Nell, can you hear us?
Yeah, copy that. Okay, we've got audio and video back up.
Sam and I are with Detective Lieutenant Kelly and Detective Sergeant Williams from the Five-O Task Force.
we're heading back to L. A. as fast as possible.
did they secure the plane?
uh, Kensi and Deeks are at the airport with the authorities.
we tried to contact the pilot before they landed but couldn't.
is the plane secured, yes or no?
no.
okay, okay.
you know, uh, I've really been looking forward to getting back to the mainland but not under these circumstances.
move! Get out of the way!
watch it! Move! Move!
is this Hanalei Flight 792? - Yes.
you have to keep the passengers onboard.
but they've already deplaned. Is this about the passenger who died?
the passenger that-- wait, what happened? - Well, there was a death on the flight.
uh, they waited to remove the body until the rest of the passengers were off.
we need to see that body right now.
okay.
NCIS. Where's the body?
we're still waiting for the coroner. We have no idea what happened to her.
that's not Prodeman. Who is she?
where are her personal belongings?
we didn't find anything left on the plane.
no, the seating chart has her name as Sharon Walker, and according to this, she was traveling with a companion. Guess who?
Jarrod Prodeman? - Bingo.
hemorrhagic smallpox could have caused her to bleed out... everywhere.
are we gonna get sick, too? There were 230 people on this plane.
prolonged face-to-face exposure or direct contact with infected bodily fluids is required for transmission.
the Health Department's gonna do a follow-up with everybody on the plane.
okay, Eric, I'm sending you a photo. Jarrod Prodeman was traveling with someone.
want to head him off at baggage claim?
do not let anybody else come in contact with the body.
the dead woman's name is Sharon Walker.
according to airline records, she was traveling with a man we think is carrying the virus-- Jarrod Prodeman.
and so far, I haven't spotted him in the airport.
and I find nothing that links these two together, aside from the fact that they were staying in the same hotel in Hawaii.
maybe Virus Boy made a love connection.
or maybe he knew we'd be looking for a Single White Male and not a happy vacationing couple.
I'll update Granger.
guys, move out of the way! - Back up, back up, back up!
you guys! Back up! Back up! Back up! Back up.
excuse me, excuse me.
Eric, we got this place locked down. Holler out if you've got eyes on him.
okay, Jarrod Prodeman, five-nine, about 180, brown hair, brown eyes.
you guys have his photograph. He may be in disguise.
he may be carrying two sets of carry-ons, including a purse.
do you see him? - Maybe. Baseball cap, denim jacket.
no, it's not him. It's not him.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Eric, do you see him?
got him. - Where is he?
Eric, where is he?
he left.
what do you mean, he left?
he never went to baggage claim.
he got in a cab and drove off six minutes ago.
he's gone.
Eric and Nell are still trying to track down the cab.
do you know that we live on the only planet in the known universe with life on it?
a planet with a fragile ecosystem; small, breathable atmosphere, all of which could be wiped out in a second by a meteorite or a mega-quake or...
this isn't your B'ak'tun '12 end of the world apocalypse theories again?
no, I'm just saying, it's a shame, you know?
we're all alone on this rock, and yet we're still finding ways to kill each other.
Oh, don't get philosophical on me. It creeps me out.
what's the worst that can happen, right?
global pandemic, wipes out half the world's population.
kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it? - How's that?
you guys might want to see this.
this is a simulation of the predicted spread of a smallpox pandemic beginning in Los Angeles.
Oh, my God.
it's a worst-case scenario.
with containment, isolation and inoculation, we can, theoretically, prevent this.
did you find the cab yet?
um, I lost him in airport traffic, but, uh, Nell's on the phone with the cab company trying to determine where the driver dropped him off.
and Jarrod Prodeman?
Jarrod Prodeman was a respected epidemiologist from Pittsburgh.
divorced, no kids.
he was disgraced back in 2007
when it was revealed he cooked some data to pump up his research.
wh-what is this? Is it revenge?
maybe. But who's paying for it?
not Prodeman. He's broke.
he's been living in Hawaii for the last several months, no apparent means of income.
okay. Follow the money trail, it might lead us to Prodeman and the virus.
this is Special Agent Kensi Blye and our LAPD liaison, Detective Marty Deeks.
Hey. How are you?
nice to finally meet you.
thank you. Wish it was under different circumstances.
this place is great. I feel like we should be eating nachos and ordering a pitcher of margaritas.
our building is a fine example of the Spanish Mission style of California.
the least we could do is to preserve its heritage.
after all, first impressions are so important.
operations Manager Hetty Lange, this is Detective Sergeant...
Oh... Detective Daniel Williams, and Detective Chin Ho Kelly.
I appreciate your being here to help us out, gentlemen.
well, there's too much at stake for us not to see this through.
agreed. You're the first outsiders to ever step foot in this operations center.
it shows you the severity of the situation.
well, I appreciate you not blindfolding us.
right. The good news is we were able to detain most of the passengers at baggage claim, along with the flight crew.
the Health Department's looking over them now.
any leads on Prodeman?
Eric's still trying to track him down.
well, um... perhaps you and Mr. Deeks could, uh, brief our guests.
I need to speak with the two of you.
okay. This way.
she, uh, come with the building? - Easy, tiger. She's got ears like a bat.
Really? She sleep upside-down, too?
okay, I'll be over here. - Okay.
we are up to our asses in alligators on this one, gentlemen.
you know what will happen when the media gets ahold of this.
all hell's going to break loose.
it's gonna make hell look organized.
misinformation and confusion will lead to panic.
fear will lead to a mass exodus, traffic jams, rioting, looting.
market will drop, America will become a pariah, even to its allies.
fundamentalists will think it's an act of God.
it'll be a cluster... - Bomb.
at some point, you're going to have to alert the public for their own safety.
unfortunately, yes.
but until then, you've been granted plenary power to do whatever it takes to stop this here and now.
okay, thank you. Bye.
so, the taxi company told Nell that a man matching Preman's description paid in cash and was dropped off at the Seaward Hotel in Venice.
we also have an address for Sharon Walker.
excellent. But Detectives Deeks, Williams and Kelly need a smallpox inoculation before we can go any further.
Wh-why... why-why just us?
cause everybody else already had the vaccine.
isn't there some sort of pill we can take? - How about a patch?
maybe some nasal spray? - No.
I'm not a... not a huge fan of needles.
guests, uh... You should probably go to the guests first. You should go first.
no, uh, I,uh... You go ahead. I got to work on my... sleeve here.
ten bucks says one of 'em goes down.
come on, boys. Man up.
come on, Deeks. I'll buy you ice cream if you don't cry.
I don't want any ice cream.
Really?
that's it.
so, you might feel a... tiny little prick.
I'm sorry, wait, I may feel a little what?
it's probably not his first time.
man down.
would you stop scratching it?
it burns. Did you see her? She stabbed me like she was fending off a bear attack.
how's your head doing? - It's fine.
what? I didn't pass out, I tripped.
you dropped like a rock. - Like I tripped on a rock.
okay. Well, don't fall out there, Stumbles.
you know what? I find it rather unbecoming that you laughed at me in front of the Five-O boys.
it was funny.
I'm glad that you all bonded over the hilarity of my misfortune.
Oh, come on, don't be such a drama queen.
what about your little performance back there? - What are you talking about?
what am I talking about? The over-the-top laughing, the hair flip, the pelvic tilt.
you were throwing out more flirtation signals than a divorcée on a singles' cruise.
Oh, my God, you have a concussion.
no, what I have is a partner who freaks out, turns into a schoolgirl every time there's cute new boys hanging around.
okay, you are a liar.
and, by the way, I find it very interesting that you thought that they were cute.
got a little island fever going on? Huh?
you know what, tell me, tell me that you didn't do this. Danno.
adjust my ponytail?
Uh-huh. You adjusted your ponytail so you could present your armpits.
what? - The armpit is the center of pheromone production.
you are certifiably insane.
I'm not the one presenting my scent glands to everybody.
I'm glad you didn't because the only thing that you give off is repellent.
Oh, you know what? You love my scent.
in fact you probably sleep with one of my old T-shirts. I am missing one, actually.
that's because it crawled out of your gym bag, and I shot it to put it out of its misery.
Oh, and, um, for the record...
...I don't sleep with anything on.
unless it's a costume.
that was uncalled for.
can I help you?
Yeah. I'm Special Agent Blye, NCIS. This is Detective Deeks, LAPD.
is this the home of Sharon Walker?
Yes. Why? Is my sister okay?
you're Sharon Walker's sister?
Carol. Yes, she's my twin.
perhaps it would be better if we came inside to talk.
perhaps it would be better if you told me what the hell's going on.
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
what sort of bad news?
about your sister, Sharon.
look, Sharon's on her way back from Hawaii-- she's going to be here any minute.
I'm sorry, but your sister passed away on the flight home.
maybe you should slow down.
maybe you should remember our rule about not criticizing each other's driving.
I'm not criticizing. I just don't want you to lose the Five-O guys.
if they can tail a suspect, I'm sure they can follow me.
they live on an island.
they're cops, not the Skipper and Gilligan.
maybe you and I should retire to a nice warm island.
what about my family? - Oh, you could bring them.
gee, thanks. - No, I mean it.
after this is all over, we ought to settle down somewhere nice and quiet.
do some fishing, some golfing, build things.
what kind of things?
I don't know. Whatever guys build when they retire. You know, like hobby stuff.
hobby stuff? - Yeah.
you don't fish, and you don't golf. - I'm not retired.
you don't have any hobbies.
the only way a guy like you would retire is with a bullet.
nice. - Wh...
Thanks. - What I meant to say...
what I meant to say was that I can't see you giving this up. All right?
then say that, okay? Don't jinx me by saying that I'm gonna to get...
you know what. - Okay.
I've been,"you know what" several times. - I know.
I'm already pressing my luck.
you know what I'm doing after we get this guy? - What's that?
I'm getting a hobby.
maybe you should start scrapbooking our cases.
Eric. Yeah, I need you to track Prodeman's movements after he arrived at to the hotel.
I'm on it, but it's not going to be easy, G.
I know, just do your best. - Will do.
Sharon Walker's carry-on and purse were in the closet, but Hazmat didn't find any signs of the virus.
room safe was empty, too. - You think he's in the wind?
I think Sharon Walker's death wasn't part of the plan, which means he may be improvising.
great, he's more likely to make a mistake that way.
makes him more dangerous, too.
if we don't find this guy fast, we may want to head back to Hawaii.
so, the manager says Prodeman hasn't had any incoming or outgoing phone calls or any visitors.
the room's only rented for a night.
he hasn't been here long enough for any of the guests or staff to have really gotten a good look at him.
did you try the locals?
Yeah, not so helpful, although I did speak to a woman who said she saw Jesus fishing off the pier yesterday.
she say what he was using for bait?
no. Los Angeles-- where the crazy come to vacation.
I kind of like it. It's like being at the circus.
you may not want to be down here during the full moon though.
you know, maybe we missed him.
maybe not.
is that him?
I'd call that a yes. - Federal agents!
think that hurt as bad as it looked?
Yeah, that's going to leave a mark.
I want a lawyer.
what do you think, Sam?
I think... if I was him...
I'd want to be the one in the courtroom who tried to stop a deadly pandemic, not the one who helped kill millions of people.
I didn't know that it was smallpox. Okay?
I thought we were pirating someone's drug research.
so how do you explain the death of Sharon Walker?
Sharon had cancer.
okay? She was in Hawaii celebrating a remission.
she must have relapsed or something.
why'd you steal her personal belongings?
I panicked. Okay? I panicked.
I didn't want to stick around and answer questions.
I was going to give them to her family first chance I got.
nice try.
patient beta developed flu-like symptoms 20 hours ago.
temperature of 38. 5 degrees Celsius.
eight hours later, a rash emerged on the tongue and in the mouth.
I expect a pustular rash period to begin within the next ten or 12 hours.
your voice was matched to those experiments you performed on the people in Hawaii.
combine those with Sharon Walker...
that's five murders with a class "A" select agent.
that's a Title 18, Section 2332
bioterrorist attack on American citizens.
that's the death penalty.
times five.
last chance.
who was paying you off?
her name is... Dr. Rachel Holden.
I hope it was worth it.
no, monkey, everything is fine. Okay?
I just needed to come here for a couple days for work.
look, I gotta go. Um, I'll call you both in a little bit.
I just thought that I should call my daughter.
how's this going?
we just got a name. Dr. Rachel Holden. Your guys are already running it down.
I just hope they're quick about it.
what about an abandoned missile silo?
underground? Uh, thanks, but no, thanks.
if I'm going to be bugging out, I'm want to be on a deserted tropical island.
just me, couple hundred of my favorite books.
I have excellent tropical survival skills.
just putting it out there, for the record.
okay, there are tons of Dr. Rachel Holdens in this country
doctors, dentists, veterinarians, not to mention those with PhDs.
Uhp, I think I may have found her.
I have a Dr. Rachel Holden, she's an epidemiologist at the Malibu Cancer Institute.
Yeah, just knock my stuff out of the way. - She doesn't look like a mad scientist.
you know what they say about crazy women.
no, I don't. What do they say?
I don't know. Uh, but they probably say something.
I'll alert the others.
why was she making it? - I don't know.
who was paying her?
I don't know. Okay, I brought it here.
she met me at the hotel and paid me. That was the end of it for me.
she had to have a buyer. - She never told me who.
smallpox is a weapon of mass destruction...
I know, Monkey, I miss you, too. But I'll see you in a couple days, okay?
all right, I love you too. Bye, Monkey.
none of the victims in Hawaii have any connections to L. A. or to Jarrod Prodeman.
this doesn't make any sense. We must be missing something.
Yeah. Besides a couple nights of sleep? - Right.
I'm really hungry. Is there anything to eat in this secret hideout of yours?
there's a taco truck around the corner, if you want to grab a pencil, start taking orders.
Wow. I was under the impression that Hetty packed your lunch.
Oh, Hetty packs my-- That's funny. This guy, he's funny.
I hope that my witty banter isn't this annoying.
whoever said you were witty?
Oh, touché.
that's it? You're out? - I'm out.
so did McGarrett ever find out what Shelburne meant?
Yeah, he thought he did, but, uh... - But?
but he's still looking for answers.
can I help you with something?
just thinking about your hair. Is it bulletproof?
that's good. I mean, you got, you got a haircut like my neighbor's Schnauzer, and you're talking to me about grooming.
this-- style by pillow. - I don't know what that means.
it's a lot less hair spray.
that's good.
just warming you up for the A game.
the A game? - Yeah.
all right. Well, I'll be careful; I don't want you to hurt yourself.
please get that. - Yeah.
sorry to interrupt you, but we have an address for Dr. Rachel Holden. Thank God.
don't, uh... don't break anything, yeah? - All right.
so, Dr. Rachel Holden is supposedly on sabbatical, except for the fact her house has been foreclosed on and her car was repossessed.
sounds like someone going into hiding. - Or someone fleeing the country.
so Eric and Nell requested access to her files and to her office,
are you kidding me? We don't have time for this.
which is why you and I will be playing doctor.
well, actually, that's not true.
I'll be playing doctor, and you'll be playing my nurse.
Why? Because you look more like a doctor than I do?
no, because you look more like a nurse than I do.
that is really sexist. - You say sexist, I say sexy.
okay, I am playing the doctor, you are playing the nurse.
too late. I already called it.
doctor.
who is this? - This is Murray.
they took out my spleen.
and he was only here visiting someone.
and what are we gonna do with Murray? - Murray is our cover.
are you gonna check me?
Yes, Murray, she's gonna check you.
no, no. I'm not. What is Dr. Holden's office number?
150-- right up here. Cover me.
now I'm gonna check you. - Take what's yours, Murray.
take a deep breath for me. One more time.
excuse me. Who are you? - What? Who? Who, me?
you don't work here. - Oh, I'm actually, uh... I'm a private nurse.
I'm Mr. Edelstein's home health care provider.
my patient pulled his catheter out again.
I need somebody to hold him down while I put it back in.
wow, you're in luck, because that's actually Dr. Blye's specialty.
she's a urologist. Why don't you go help her with that; I can handle this.
great, thanks.
you are so going to pay for this.
you're the one that wanted to be the doctor. I even called it. See you later.
Hey, Murray? Keep an eye out, yeah? High-five. You're awesome.
and the four angels, who had been prepared for this very hour "and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind...
Oh, my God.
why do you keep running this?
when I get tired or frustrated, it helps me to remember the victims.
their loss pushes me to keep going. Try a little harder.
it's so disturbing.
that's why I'm running it down here instead of up in OPS.
so, uh, did you find anything else about Dr. Rachel Holden?
uh, yeah. She hasn't used her credit card for several weeks, but two of the last things she purchased were plane tickets.
one for Jarrod Prodeman to Amsterdam, the other for herself, uh
taca International Flight 529.
it leaves LAX tomorrow at 7: 42 a. m. for San Jose, Costa Rica.
whoa, she's fleeing the country in less than 24 hours.
which means, whatever she's doing with the virus, it's going down today.
we just don't know what, when or with whom.
well, Kensi and Deeks are bringing me her hard drive. Hopefully there's something on it.
I just don't understand why somebody would want to do this.
money? Revenge? Religious fanaticism, maybe?
Yeah, but it's just so stupid, for lack of a better word.
I mean, if you're smart enough to regenerate this virus, then you're smart enough to understand the dangers that surround it.
no kidding. It's hard enough to get your hands on the vaccine.
hold up. You're a genius.
well, yeah. Wait, what do you mean?
the vaccine.
whoever is handling this stuff understands how dangerous it is, right?
so they're going to want to be vaccinated before they touch it.
exactly. And if you're not...
well, you'd have to... steal it.
from either a military base or a State Health Department facility.
worth a shot.
here we go. Two weeks ago, break-in at the State Health Department facility in Torrance.
so, like you were saying, I am a genius.
right. I'll tell Hetty.
hope that high-five means good news.
we'll find out soon enough. How'd you guys make out?
well, we learned that Kensi missed her calling. She should have been a doctor.
it was disgusting. Have you ever put in a catheter?
not professionally. Is that Rachel Holden's hard drive?
Yeah, but I think it's been wiped clean. There's nothing on it.
for you maybe.
Ah, I bet this baby's got plenty of secrets to tell me, don't you, honey?
you're a good little girl, aren't you? You know it.
I... I'll let you know what I find.
you do that.
what do you think the chances are that he has a homemade sex robot?
why, did you break yours again? - No, Robo-Kensi's still going strong.
Oh, you disgust me. - Robo-Kensi never talks to me like that.
this is the man the LAPD suspects in the break-in at the State Health Department facility.
his name is Gabriel Marchal.
pretty name for an ugly man.
robbery has passed the case over to Narcotics.
narcotics doesn't want to move on the case because they feel nothing of significant street value was stolen;
they want to build their case.
none of which helps us.
no, but Marchal is linked to several unsavory groups. Remember the ELE?
enhanced Law Enforcement. They're a homegrown militia group.
the ELE took it upon themselves to secure the border by killing innocent people.
but we took those guys down two years ago. - Apparently not all of them.
well, it makes sense, in a sick way.
you want to stop immigration forever, release an epidemic of smallpox in Mexico.
our government would have no choice but to lock down the border.
so where do we find these guys?
have backup ready to roll in and lock this place down the minute you hear from me.
Hey, so I got three out front, two on the inside, that I can see, anyway.
and every one of them is packing.
this place will clear out once the sun goes down, but we don't have time for that.
sop would be to evacuate the area and send in a tactical hazmat team.
I like that. Send in the professional bug hunters.
unfortunately, these people are paranoid by nature.
they see us clearing area, they're going to go ballistic.
same thing if they see someone in a hazmat suit.
Yeah, Callen's right. We can try and take these guys quietly, but if they decide to open up with all these tourists around, there's going to be a blood bath.
maybe we don't take them quietly. - Why are you smiling?
chin, why are you smiling? Why are you smiling now, too?
everybody's smiling. Everybody's smiling except me.
you can smile. - No, no, I only smile when I'm happy.
and this does not make me happy, it makes me very nervous.
so give me your nervous smile.
like that? - Yeah, something like that.
Earthquake!
federal agents!
out of there! - Move!
go on. Hands where I can see them. Hold them up.
it's not here.
what does that mean?
I think that means they didn't find it.
it means we're screwed.
Gabrielle Marchal denies getting anything from Dr. Rachel Holden.
well, I've got proof he wired over $100, 000 to a bank account in Honolulu six weeks ago.
so he and his group bankrolled her in exchange for the virus, but she ripped them off instead?
the good doctor has a death wish.
Yeah, she does. For all of us.
did Eric get anything off her computer?
Dr. Rachel Holden did a fairly decent job of erasing her hard drive.
looks like she never used it for anything other than work.
she left it behind because there was nothing for us to find.
I did, however, find some of her published research articles, several of which deal with pandemics.
she's an immunologist-- that's what she does.
Yeah, but it's the nature of her later articles that's a little disturbing.
how so?
Holden posits that pandemics are a natural part of the ebb and flow of life on this planet, and that by interfering with it, we are meddling with nature in a way that could lead to our undoing.
Mm. The Gaia theory.
the idea that the Earth is a complex interactive system that keeps life in balance.
essentially, the planet is a self-cleaning oven.
exactly.
she also posits that by wiping smallpox off the face of the Earth, we've eliminated one of the planet's regulating systems.
she believes she's doing God's work by releasing a plague of biblical proportions.
in her mind, the only way to save the planet is by allowing it to naturally thin out the human herd
in this case, through smallpox.
she's intending on leaving in the morning, which means whatever she's planning is going to go down in the next few hours.
okay. Maybe Dr. Holden is planning on taking the virus with her.
Costa Rica looks like a place more to hide out than to launch a pandemic.
you'd want to spread it as quickly as possible. - Like at an international airport.
maybe she left it at the airport.
international passengers come in contact with it, take them with them wherever they go.
but she's got to know we'll be looking for her. I mean, all the airports are on high alert.
okay, so I think I got something.
two months ago, she ordered enough office supplies to stock a small business.
didn't think anything of it until I found this.
an order for 300 custom T-shirts from a local clothing company.
and when I called the office supply store, they confirmed that most of the purchases were school supplies.
wait a minute. She's targeting kids?
that's her dispersal mechanism.
like the British giving blankets infected with smallpox to Native Americans.
you give a kid a T-shirt, he takes it home, he infects his family.
she could be donating it to schools.
do you remember when we were at the airport?
there was that group of teenagers at baggage claim?
it was a class trip of sorts.
it's too late for spring break, right?
I don't know, but there was a group of Japanese students, and I'm pretty sure I heard other kids speaking German.
damn it. International Leaders of Tomorrow.
high School seniors "representing 36 different countries "are gathering for a series of lectures and exercises "designed to encourage dialogue, understanding, tolerance and friendship.
that's definitely not as fun as spring break.
we need to shut it down. - It's too late. It started an hour ago.
you... you got to put that bag down. - Drop the bags!
okay.
whoa, what's your damage, dude?
my damage, genius, is that I'm a cop and I just saved your life.
Where'd you get this? - Get your own, man. They're giving them away for free.
we got a location. Southeast corner.
I see her. Blue awning.
federal agents!
Callen, she's running!
we got her, Kensi. Lock it down and scramble hazmat.
we got the vials. - Get out of the car.
out of the car now.
Rachel Holden, you're under arrest.
the Earth is dying, and we are the disease.
I was just trying to give the planet a fighting chance.
by killing millions of people?
it took tens of thousands of years for the planet's population to reach a billion.
but we've gone from six to seven billion in 12.
you do the math. - No, I hate math.
what happened if your pandemic killed the people who could one day solve our problems?
you didn't think about that one, did you?
it's all right. You'll have plenty of time to think about it in prison.
get her out of here.
the Health Department and the CDC have secured the gift bags and are vaccinating anyone who may have been exposed.
and Assistant Director Granger called to thank the Five-O Task Force for their assistance.
what, that's it?
I think that's pretty much everything. Did we miss something?
Yeah, you missed the fact that we basically saved the world.
Oh, that's a tad dramatic, my friend, but accurate nonetheless.
he's right-- it's a big deal.
I mean, we should get some sort of medals or at least some sort of presidential commendation.
we don't need medals.
I'd like it if Air Force One picked us up and flew us over to Vegas and gave us a complimentary suite in one of the high roller rooms.
nice. That's what I'm talking about. This man has vision.
you know what? I'll settle for a hot shower and a cold beer.
well, the shower's on you guys, beer's on us. It's the least we could do.
uh, we appreciate it, but we really should go.
what, you're not going to stay for a drink? - You got a hot date, Danny?
no. Uh, we left the kids in charge of the island, so we got to go.
well, there's that, and he's scared of Hetty.
I'm not scared of Hetty. Okay, I think she's a delightful lady, but have you ever seen Trilogy of Terror?
you know the little, uh, voodoo doll, comes to life?
starring Karen Black.
I worked with her and Nicholson on Five Easy Pieces.
or, as I like to call it, Six Hellish Weeks.
that's, uh... that's very cool.
well, on behalf of myself and NCIS,
I'd like to thank Detective Williams and Detective Kelly for their assistance.
you are most welcome.
I don't bite, Detective. Unless provoked.
okay. I will never provoke you. I promise.
uh, we really do have a plane to catch.
but next time, we will take you up on your offer for drinks.
and maybe we can take a little side trip to Disneyland.
Disney...? What are you, 12?
I will have you know that it is the happiest place on Earth.
see, that's not cool.
uh, good luck with your Gypsy blood feud.
Yeah, let's do it again sometime. Just not any time soon.
Aloha. - Aloha.
well, I think they would make good NCIS agents.
Yeah, now we know where to go if we need a Deeks replacement.
can't we just get one from the pound, like last time?
detective Williams is just a tad cheeky for my liking. - No kidding.
reminds me of another detective I know.
what? Me? No, no. No, no. I'm not cheeky; I'm charming.
and I'm so much funnier than him, am I not?
guys? Can you back me up on this? I'm actually much funnier?
I just want you to stop and think for a second what this place would be like without me.
let me see.
peaceful, professional, sanitary.
feel free to stop me any time, Mr. Deeks.
sugar bear?
good morning, sleepyhead.
I thought you were going to wake me up.
I was going to, but then you were doing that cute little twitchy thing with your nose.
I have a tendency of doing that when I'm happy.
you eat?
I'm starving.
make your wife some pancakes.
get in there.
turn that punch over.
keep your core stable.
great job.
who's next?
looks like your new toy took you down.
do not mock the Nexersys system.
thing'll kick your ass.
a faceless avatar?
I'm old school.
no way a computer can give you a better workout than a real sparring partner.
state-of-the-art technology.
more advanced than a human.
okay.
all right, let's get locked and loaded.
bend those knees. - Okay.
lead body, power body.
lead kick, power kick.
get your feet going.
jab cross.
lead dig.
power dig.
nice snap in those strikes. Nice combo.
hate to break up the Real Steel match, but Hetty needs you up in Ops.
one more round.
okay, but she said... - This will just take a second.
okay, Sam, let's take this up to the next level. Let's do it.
advanced level.
jab cross.
lead dig.
power sweep.
system error.
impressive rotation on that sweep, Mr. Hanna, but I suggest you move your feet right up to OPS.
you, too, Mr. Callen.
tried to warn you guys.
nice job.
and then she put her darks in with my whites and now all my clothes are purple, so I look like Barney the dinosaur.
I mean, what husband can put up with this? This marriage is doomed.
no, no, this marriage is doomed because you are OCD.
what do you mean, because I like to clean?
I mean, honestly, who does that?
you two have really gotten into playing the role of a married couple.
very authentic, right down to the bickering, but don't forget, one of your neighbors is a Russian sleeper agent.
what's the latest?
well, everyone's bought our cover story that we are house-sitting for my Uncle Mark while he's on vacation.
Eric, could you please roll the surveillance tape?
as you can see, we've been able to plant additional cameras in the neighborhood.
so far all we have is fairs and a near homicide at a designer sample sale.
evidently those ladies go crazy for their Cavallis.
so who's left to investigate?
number one: Floyd Hobbs.
grumpy retiree who lived in the community for 30 years.
word is that he gave out actual rocks last year at Halloween.
down the street from him is Serena Miller.
no husband, no boyfriend.
rumor has it, she went through a nasty breakup, now spends most of the time by herself.
Ah, the little rug rats-- the Felton boys.
otherwise known as birth control for the entire neighborhood.
and that is Jane Felton-- their mother.
I have only said hello in passing.
rob and Bob are in the convertible-- or as I like to call 'em, Brob.
they've owned the local bakery for the past ten years.
and last but not least, we have Brett Turner and his fiance Polina Grafetta.
aka the neighborhood hotties. We scored an invite to dinner at their house tonight.
and I'm still trying to find the whereabouts of our missing Russian businessman Mikhail Kroyov.
unfortunately Kroyov vanished before he could give up the sleeper agent's name, but we have footage of him at an ATM ten days ago.
Oh, my God.
Yes, please.
what the hell?
this is not...I don't know where, why...
that's, I think I was hacked, so...
here's, uh, Kroyov's photo.
the agent has to have other contacts outside of the community.
maybe it's time to visit my old friend Arkady, see if he's heard anything on the street.
by all means, call in all your favors, gentlemen.
a-a word with you two.
so, about what just happened...
too soon. - Got it.
may I offer you a cup?
Lapsang souchong from the Wuyi Hills of China.
no, thank you. - Yeah, no, I'm good,
I actually prefer my tea in a bottle vacuum-sealed in America.
why do I feel like we've been called into the principal's office?
have you done something wrong?
well, that could be a trick question.
no, we've done nothing wrong. - Not that we know of.
have we?
well, then...
you don't think that we're...?
I mean, that he and I...?
not in a million years. - Okay, that's enough.
you don't have to insult your husband.
I'm simply saying that such an intimate assignment can impact the judgment of even the most professional agents.
you are up against a highly trained Russian sleeper agent who will protect his own identity at any cost.
you need to be at the top of your game.
right. - That's absolutely true.
I understand, top of the game... - But I always feel...
Hey, sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll want to see this.
we found Mikhail Kroyov, our link to the sleeper agent.
this video was taken at the Beverly Regis less than an hour ago.
do we know where he went when he left the elevator?
actually, he never left the elevator.
a bellboy found Kroyov a few minutes later.
so the only connection we have to the sleeper agent is dead.
honey, I'm home.
in the kitchen.
what smells good?
what do you, what do you got there?
snickerdoodles.
are they edible?
what? You're not exactly known for your cooking prowess.
okay, this is happening.
that and the fact you tried to put tinfoil in the microwave last week.
I found a very easy Martha Stewart recipe online.
really, Martha Stewart?
ow, really?
any update on Kroyov?
Yeah, he was injected with a fast-acting toxin. No I.D. on the killer.
it sounds like our sleeper agent woke up. - Yep.
wait a minute, what are you, what are you doing?
where are you going? - This is for the old man in 534.
I figured he's lived here forever, probably knows everything that goes on.
only thing is, he doesn't like people.
snickerdoodles.
don't you have a jacket or something?
I don't need the whole neighborhood checking out my wife.
Martha Stewart my ass!
you suppose Hetty gave Kensi and Deeks the talk?
what talk?
you know, the talk she gives when agents go undercover as a couple.
must have missed that one.
she never gave you the "intimate undercover assignment" talk?
unfamiliar feelings and emotions
none of this rings a bell? - Nope, guess she thought I was too professional to need it.
probably thought no one would get close enough to you to have to worry.
what, are you saying that I'm cold and distant?
let's just say, if you had an online dating profile... - Which I would never do.
probably wouldn't hurt if you did. - But I don't...
but just for argument's sake, if you did...
there's no argument about it. I would never do that.
I don't think that my soul mate is a mouse-click away.
whatever.
so you're not gonna tell me now? - This is exactly what I'm talking about.
I don't know what you mean. - I know. Trust me.
I know.
Dobroye utro, my friends. What a surprise.
you're looking well.
well, my doctor told me to lay off latkes, join gym.
I'm miserable.
but you're not here to talk about my health. What is it?
a man was killed today.
russian businessman. Mikhail Kroyov.
don't know him.
yeah? Maybe you know some of his friends.
here are some DMV photos.
Bob Wright and Rob Nelson.
Brett Turner and Polina Grafetta.
you know her?
she resembles my ex.
which one?
the one who recently passed, God rest her soul.
aren't they all dead?
I do not have best luck with women.
think how they feel.
I do not like him.
just answer the question.
my last wife, Natasha.
this woman... they could be sisters.
is she married?
sorry I cannot help you.
guy's hung up on his ex.
I know for a fact he hated Natasha, and she looked nothing like Mrs. Felton.
she was a six-foot tall former Miss Ukraine.
why would he lie?
he definitely reacted when he saw these photos.
let me see them again.
maybe he was reacting to this woman, not to Mrs. Felton.
pull up everything we've got on Mrs. Felton and Serena Miller.
Mr. Hobbs?
Mr. Hobbs, my name is Melissa Waring.
we're house-sitting down the street for my uncle.
I just wanted to introduce myself.
well, okay.
it's all right if you're busy. Maybe another time.
I made you some cookies. I'm gonna leave 'em here on your doorstep.
okay, enjoy.
it's a start.
Hey, guys. Toxicology report's back on Mikhail Kroyov.
he died of a concentrated cocktail of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.
injection point was the arm.
where the guy in the elevator touched him.
anything on Jane Felton?
she's a stay-at-home mom. Checks all the boxes, nothing unusual.
what about Miller?
Serena Miller-- she's single, never married, lives alone.
she works as a loan officer at the Certified National Bank downtown.
it's a good gig for a sleeper agent.
access to personal information and cash.
keep digging. - Roger that.
so, I'm on, Romancing-The-One.com Same as you.
kind of a funny coincidence.
my-my user name is GeekToys82, in case you're bored, and want to, you know, look it up and...
...check it out.
let's get back to work. - That's a great idea.
okay. - Okay.
what's this?
is that a trick question?
what is my bra doing in your sock drawer?
I plead completely innocent, but totally intrigued.
look, you are really testing the boundaries here, buddy.
boundaries? What are you talking about?
we're married. There are no boundaries.
what's mine is yours, and what's yours is mine.
no, no, boundaries are what make a marriage work.
particularly when it comes to sharing a bed.
Yeah, about that-- I prefer to sleep on the right side.
no. We've talked about that. I can't sleep unless I'm on the right side.
actually, you kind of sleep in a diagonal, like a starfish, with your arms out like this.
you're kind of taking up all four quadrants of the bed, but I'm okay with that.
you want to know why? 'Cause I don't care about boundaries.
so, if my wife wants to spend the whole night hogging the whole bed, snoring in my ear like an animal, I'm cool with it.
Hey, I do not snore.
no, it's more like a... like a snort-snore. It's kind of a...
I do not do that. - It's like a piglet.
like you don't snore.
all right, Brett Turner's background checks out.
I don't know. There's something still off about this guy.
is someone jealous?
jealous of what?
I don't know. His chiseled features, lean body, bulging biceps.
I don't need to hate. I got my own thing going on.
Yeah, go ahead, Eric.
Hey, I got an update on Serena Miller.
according to her boss, she's on vacation in Florida.
has been for the past week.
okay, well, then, either her boss is lying to us, or she's lying to her boss, because I just saw her drive down the street in her BMW.
okay, please, please put the gun down.
my name is Melissa. I'm just house-sitting next door, and-and I heard a scream, so I came in here to see if everything was okay.
please. Please put the gun down.
you need backup?
Yup.
get up!
slowly.
so much for backup.
special Agent Blye, NCIS.
that's Detective Deeks, LAPD.
who are you?
I want protection.
you pulled a gun on a federal agent.
I thought you were one of them. - One of who?
give me protection, and I will tell you everything.
I'm not giving you anything until you tell me who you are.
my name is Serena Miller.
and your real name?
a man named Mikhail Kroyov was killed today.
I had nothing to do with that. - Then who did?
my handler. He-he suspected Mikhail was a traitor.
we are not safe here.
he knows I want out. He's gonna send other people, other agents...
just like he did with Mikhail. - Who's your handler?
no more until you guarantee me protection.
I don't want this life anymore.
please. I want a normal life.
a family.
I can't guarantee anything, but I can take you someplace safe.
I'll use her car, take her to the boatshed.
you run interference.
I'll meet you there.
move.
down, Chewie. Bad dog!
I'm so sorry.
he gets excited every time he sees a cute guy.
you're very naughty, but you have excellent taste.
Oh, sorry. I'm-I'm Bob Wright. I live right over there.
Hi. Justin Waring. I'm house-sitting.
Oh, I know. Yeah, yeah. For the Colonel.
sister? Friend?
uh, she's... wife.
all the good ones are always taken.
speaking of the missus, I... I really got to run.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
you know, my, uh... my partner and I own La Grand Baguette up on Main.
you should come by some time. - Okay.
Yeah, I'll hook you up with some muffins.
okay. Thank you for that. Nice to meet you.
okay, you drive. I'll give directions.
Serena. - Help me.
are you okay? - Help me.
Deeks, Serena's down. She' shaving some sort of seizure.
you want an ambulance?
I think she's been poisoned.
Serena? Serena, who is your handler?
Alex... Vasnev. Here.
here? Your handler is here?
Alex Vasnev. Where?
we lost her, Deeks.
Kensi, get out of there now!
there's no record of Alex Vasnev ever living in the neighborhood.
well, if Vasnev is the Russian handler, he's probably living under an alias.
or 'she' is. Alex could also be a woman.
we need a log of everyone coming in and out of the neighborhood, as well as everyone's movements inside.
Yeah. Eric's already going through the surveillance footage up in OPS.
what do we do about her body?
we leave her.
there's nothing that can be done for that poor woman now.
best to maintain our cover and keep Serena's house under surveillance.
and if the handler lives in the neighborhood,
Kensi and Deeks will find him or her.
where are they now? - Back at their cover house.
you two gentlemen need to find out why Arkady lied about Serena Miller.
she chose her life just like we do.
Yeah, but all she wanted was a family.
I actually thought I'd hate it here.
a family, kids running around, happily married couple thing.
it's actually kind of comforting.
and it is nice to have someone to say good night to at the end of the day.
what's happening here? Hmm?
little mutant ninja assassins.
what? I'm just saying that, you know, for the record, if that's something you want to do,
I could help with that from a technical standpoint.
cause I am the husband, which means that I have parts of my body that are able...
mom!
he's gonna need therapy.
visitors?
federal agents!
drop your weapon.
how many times have I told you not to lie to me?
how many times do I have to lie for you not to believe me?
it was not really lie.
I didn't know her.
you done?
there, I'm done.
Serena's father was friend.
she wanted out. He asked me to help.
what did you do to help?
I put out word to my contacts.
her handler must have found out.
Alex Vasnev? - I don't know.
this is not lie.
I don't know who he is or how he found out.
they work for him.
ask them.
Polina, wh-what... what happened?
Serena was found dead. No one knows what happened.
Oh, my God. - I know, it's terrible.
really puts a damper on our dinner.
Yeah, it's not exactly the greatest of timing.
well, come anyways.
it will help take our mind off all this.
Brett and I are looking forward to it.
Yeah, no, of course we're gonna come anyways to the... yeah.
okay, see you guys at seven.
does she model?
I think Eric said that she was a model.
Yeah, cause that walk is all kinds of fantastic.
I'm gonna go see if he liked my cookies.
Yeah, good luck with that.
excuse me. - Yeah?
can you tell me why you pointed a gun at my son today?
excuse me.
you have some nerve accusing my husband of something like that.
now, I don't mean to imply that your son has a wild imagination, but he may have been chasing some very scary cowboys and Indians with his slingshot when he shattered our bay window.
Cody, is this true?
I'm sorry.
I'll write you a check.
he said there was a gun.
gas lighter for the barbeque.
grilling up some ostrich burgers.
you are so grounded.
missed Hobbs again.
any luck on the guys at Arkady's house?
uh, yeah, we got a positive ID on both.
first up is Sergei Dobrev. He's 25 years old, here illegally on an expired student visa.
several known connections to the Russian mob.
and Vasily Ikashev, 28, big time mob enforcer.
long list of arrests and misdemeanors.
any clue who they worked for? - Not yet, and no connections to Mikhail Kroyov or Serena Miller.
but we did find Vasily's address.
he has an apartment in Hollywood.
what's with Deeks?
he's, picking up Wi-Fi signals so we can snake the neighbor's Internet connections.
is that a fanny pack?
Yeah, he said something about being Method.
okay, all right.
Eric, tell me you got what you need. - Let's go check out that address.
cause I've run up and down this street, like, ten times.
the neighbors are gonna think I'm man-orexic.
Yeah, I'm picking up the last signal now.
I want you to meet Rob. - Okay.
so, your the neighbor Bob won't shut up about.
I'm Rob. - Hi, nice to...
I've been meaning to-to come by the bakery, but...
just you luck. I have samples.
you got to try these. Pomegranate macaroons.
chock-full of antioxidants, so they're good for you.
you want me to try one of the samples right now?
okay.
something tells me he doesn't eat a lot of sweets.
I swear I had a waistline before we opened our bakery. - Didn't we all?
you know, we would love to have you and your wife over for game night.
it's just, you know, Charades, Trivial Pursuit, Twister.
twister, that's, um...Yeah, that's an idea, but I got to warn you that, Melissa's pretty competitive, tends to get pretty vicious, so...
Oh, well you tell her to bring it.
and bring her appetite because I am going to make my dulce de leche cheesecake.
you will die.
I'll look forward to that, but listen, nice to see you again. High fives across the...
see you later.
sweetie, I'm home.
are we having a dance party?
Oh, my God! What are you doing?
what am I doing? What are you doing?
you got techno blaring, there's blood running through the entire house.
it's like an episode of Dexter in here.
I cut my foot on some glass, and oh, my God, what are you wearing?
no, don't change the subject. I thought something happened to you.
is that a fanny pack? - No, it's a bro-sack.
don't do that. Don't scare me like that.
fine. - Fine.
what?
I'm in a towel. - I can see that.
and you've seen too much, so could you just leave, please?
want me to take a look at your foot? - No, I don't; I want you to go away.
I'm sensing a little hostility here; you want to talk about it?
you sense correctly. Now, some privacy please?
and-and take that off. - All right.
Oh, my God, not your pants.
what? Oh, my bad.
thought you wanted me to take my pants off.
I can't believe you just did that. - I'll see you later.
walking away, but doing it slow enough so you can come after me.
want a little bit of this action? - That's so wrong, I'm not even looking
come and get it.
I'm not even...I'm not even looking. - I see you peeking.
go away!
so, Serena Miller wants out of the spy game.
calls her dad for help.
he then calls Arkady to pull some strings.
mysterious handler gets wind of it, sends his boys Sergei and Vasily to take out Arkady.
Serena's been a spy for over a decade.
her handler wouldn't want to lose such a valuable asset.
Vasily sure lived in a dump.
I got something here.
ak-47s, Makarov pistols...
standard Russian issue.
it's time to tear this place apart.
any word from Kensi or Deeks?
Yeah, they're at dinner with Brett and Polina.
so, got you a little something.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
46 Years of Football Highlights.
I read on your profile that you love football trivia, so...
okay, my sister wrote my entire page, and she put some stuff in there that she thought guys would like.
so, you're really not into buffalo-wing-eating contests?
wrestling?
or, football?
what is the Super Bowl?
okay.
you sure you don't need any help? - No, it's all good.
a couple more minutes, and we'll be ready to eat.
go have a drink, relax. - My mojitos are the best.
trick is to muddle the mint before you add the rum.
sweetheart?
cheers to new friends and neighbors.
Cheers. - Cheers.
hope it's not too strong.
no.
so, tell me, how did you two first meet?
that's a cliche story.
we met at a gym.
actually, it was an MMA gym in Chicago. - It was.
mixed martial arts. I am impressed.
no, you shouldn't be, really;
I joined with a girlfriend because she said it was a great way to meet guys, and I think I, I went twice, including the time I met Justin.
so who made the first move?
actually, our trainers introduced us.
but he was playing Mr. Tough Guy, weren't you?
I was just very into my workout. - Right.
so I gave my number to someone else to make him jealous.
but... I knew it was meant to be the moment I saw him.
here's a million dollar question.
do you remember what he was wearing?
white T-shirt, red shorts, black socks.
wow, that's actually quite impressive.
and Melissa-- what was she wearing?
are you trying to get me in trouble?
there's no possible way that I could remember that.
black tank top, jeans, bag that goes across your shoulder, hair down, wavy.
Oh, you guys are too cute.
mostly her.
so when did you first know she was the one?
Oh, thank you for that. Saved by the bell.
honey, why don't you take Melissa into the dining room?
of course.
maybe you can give me a hand with the food?
what's that perfume you're wearing?
it's my favorite Chanel.
all right.
you've never played an instrument before? - No.
you have great hands for it. - Thank you.
who needs another cocktail?
uh, I'm okay, actually. - It's not like you're driving.
sweetie, we need another round.
how about a red from the cellar. - I'll get the glasses.
I can't get a read on them.
I can tell you one thing-- that Polina's got fantastic taste, because she really wants a piece of your hubby.
Yeah, well, if my hubby weren't so self-absorbed, he would've noticed Brett's hands all over me.
did you see the shoulder rubbing with the hand thing?
are you trying to make me jealous?
no, I'm just saying that they're trying to throw us off our game.
you really think one of them is the handler?
well, they are pushing the booze and asking us a whole lot of personal questions.
that's true, and every time we ask them something, they do change the subject.
exactly.
why are you staring at me?
we're supposed to be married. Husband's don't stare at their wives.
just trying to figure out where you hid your gun.
can you do it without staring?
you are carrying, right? - Of course I am...
then where are you carrying? - I guarantee you will love this wine.
Brett, we've got a couple of lovebirds in here.
that's the spirit.
sorry. I don't know what came over me.
it must've been the cocktail.
you're a lucky man, Justin. She's a real live one.
Yeah, no, my, Aunt Hetty definitely warned me about her.
can't find anything connecting them to Serena or Mikhail.
they've been made.
a little top up? - Oh, no, no.
otherwise I'll never make it home.
that's the point.
that's my phone. I better get that.
you know, if it's important, they'll leave a message.
so, Justin, tell me about your work. You're an artist?
that's fascinating. I love artists.
do you? 'Cause that's really...
Yeah, it's actually not that exciting.
but what is exciting is you and Brett.
how did he proposed? - Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I almost forgot.
a little trick I learned down in Costa Rica.
he's been practicing for weeks.
save the champagne for dessert, sweetie.
let's give them the grand tour.
lead the way, honey.
let's start with the basement, darling.
Brett's got more tools than Home Depot.
I swear he would just spend his whole weekend down there if I'd let him.
boys and their toys.
after you.
come on, guys.
it started out as a wine cellar, and then I decided just to go all out.
it's totally soundproof, which is important in this neighborhood, if you know what I mean.
you two wait right here. I've got a surprise for you.
ready? - Really?
go. - Federal agents.
raise your... hands.
role-playing. Huh? Attaboy.
I was thinking we...
quiet. I don't want to know what you were thinking.
actually, I would like to know what you were thinking.
I mean, mostly out of professional curiosity. I can read it in the report.
so, does this mean we're being charged with something?
Yes.
you are charged with undercooking the chicken.
I'm not feeling very well. I'm going to go home.
listen, Brett, you do some good work.
I mean, this is some fine, fine, fine craftsmanship.
as much as I would like to stay, 'cause I really would like to... stay.
I see you. - Deeks.
it's a pet name. Rhymes with "freaks.
rain check.
wait, aren't you going to handcuff us or something?
okay, we need to talk about that. - You think?
who has a sex dungeon in their house? - Seriously, who has the room?
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the kiss.
the cover kiss? - That's interesting tactic for a cover.
it worked, didn't it? - Yeah, well...
I can think of a worse way to spend a Tuesday evening.
what? Kensi's private time needs a little spicing up, does it?
Hey, if you knew about Kensi private time, your head would explode.
okay. - I can be sexy and wild.
of course you can.
I can. - Okay.
you don't believe me?
all right, fine.
I'm going to tell you a little story, but no judging.
no judging.
okay, so my friend Monica and I, we met this guy over spring break, and we both liked him, we didn't think it was fair to make him choose between us, so we...
did you hear something? - No, I think you should keep going.
anyway, she was really, really pretty and she had a body to...
look out! - Get down! Down!
Oh, yeah, we've definitely been made. Came from your one o'clock.
it's Rob and Bob. I should've known.
their macaroons sucked-- no way they're gay.
cover me. - Yeah. Ready? One, two, three.
go! Go!
go!
in here! Quick!
cover me. - One, two, three. Go.
your cookies were great.
I'm Detective Deeks, LAPD. This is Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.
just stay down, stay away from the windows.
we'll take it from here, sir.
Deeks, kitchen.
drop your weapons. Drop them, now!
take them out.
on your knees. Put your hands up.
put them up!
clear.
Really? Bra holster?
Really? Furry handcuffs?
little gift from our friends.
get up.
Floyd Hobbs, real name Alexander Vasnev.
according to records, he's lived in that gated community since the '80s and helped new agents assimilate into the country.
born a spy, die a spy.
we know what spooked him? - Probably Kroyov.
Hobbs would have already known someone was coming for him.
and we were the new kids on the block.
maybe Rob and Bob saw me leave Serena's.
don't beat yourself up, Mr. Deeks.
go home. Sleep.
preferably in your own beds.
good night. - Night.
so, you and Monica met a guy...
I do not want to talk about this now.
maybe it would be cathartic.
good night, Deeks.
no, come on.
night, hubby. - Wifey?
light of my life?
sugar bear?
Oh, Mr. Deeks.
